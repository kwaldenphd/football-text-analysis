THE SCHOLASTIC YEAH
PUBLISHED WEEKLY AT NOTRE DAME. DEVOTED TO THE INTERESTS OF THE STUDENTS.
Vol. I. jSTotre Dame University, Sept. 7, 1867. No. 1.
SALUTATOEY!
We greet the friends of Notre Dame and St. Alary’s.	.
It may be well to explain to them the object of The Scholastic Yeab :	. .
It has been undertaken in order to give to- parents frequent accounts of the institutions in which they have placed their children; institutions in which the parents’" hearts must be, sb long as tlieir children remain, and of which all who have visited, it retain, we hope, a pleasing remembrance.
We wish to convey to parents, in a less formal way than by the Monthly Bulletin of Glasses and ■ Conduct, which is sent to the parents of each student, all the news that may concern their children.
We shall give an accountf-of all the arrivals at the College and Academy, both of students and friends; of the general and relative progress of the’ classes; of those students who distinguish themselves in class, in study, and athletic sports,— and many other interesting items, which, though not of importance in the great world, are of great' moment in the “ Student- Would,” and will be extremely interesting to parents. They (the parents) will see la vie intime—“theFamily Circle”— of the College, and can form a good idea of the life their children lead.
As the year goes on -we shall also give, either entire, if short, or in part, if long, the best compositions from the classes. In order to make The Scholastic Yeah a healthy and long-lived paper we have connected it with the Ave Mabia, a well-established periodical. YMliave engrafted the tender bud on a strong and vigorous tree. But The Scholastic Yeah will be adjoined only to - the edition of the Ave Mabia intended for parents.
However, as the Ave Mabia- is a strictly Cath-, olic paper, if any of the parents object to recei ve it, we beg them on the reception of this first number of The Scholastic Yeab, which is sent to all, to inform us of their unwillingness. Much as we are interested in the cause for which the Ave Ma-
bia is published—much as we wish to increase its circulation—we do not wish to force it on any one by tacking it to this publication. We beg to be told immediately, if any one has an objection to receiving the Ave Mabia with The Scholastic Yeab, and wTe shall send, if desired, The Scholastic Yeab without the Ave Mabia.
The Scholastic Yeab, either with, or icithout the Ave Mabia, is $2.50-for ten months—postage prepaid and included in the §2.50.
On the other hand we do not wish it to be thought that we are making the Ave Mabia a special medium for advertising the College and Academy. We have carefully avoided mentioning, in the pages of the Ave Mabia, every thing pertaining particularly to -the College and of no interest to the vast majority of the readers of that paper.’ It is true that on the cover of the Ave Maria, among the other advertisements, may be found the advertisements of Notre Dame and Saint Mary’s, blit no fault can be justly found- with that; for we‘ advertise all institutions that request us to do so.
We are thus explicit, because always in the inception of an undertaking, there are-many speculations concerning motives. ■ .	.
Oub motive in publishing the Ave Mabia, is found in the Prospectus of that paper—and any thing that would interfere with the object of that paper is severely left alone.
* Our motive in publishing The Scholastic Yeab has been .stated above.
Our motive in adjoining it to the Ave Mabia, has also been stated, viz: that a connection with that Paper may ensure a long and vigorous life to The Scholastic Yeab. - ’.	' ’ .
We presume that nothing more is necessary to give the parents of the students a.correct idea of the object of-The Scholastic Yeab, and to secure a favorable reception for it from them. .
We naturally take pride iii our College and Academy—not only in the buildings we have erected for the accommodation and comfort of the students, but particularly in the efforts we

^	THE SCHOLL have made to procure experienced educators for mind, heart and body, and in the success that has crowned our efforts.	. We hope also that we may become known in places where hitherto we have .not been known ; and better known in places where our name is not yet a familiar household word! ..	«»	 - LIST OP STUDENTS OE NOTEE DAME, •	•	SEPT. 3, 1867. We would like exceedingly to make The Scholastic Year an illustrated paper, so far at least as to give the photographs of the intelligent, frank, cheerful-looking students who are rapidly filling up the college halls, and making the play grounds resound with their merry games, and rejoicing the hearts of the professors by their zeal and enthusiasm in class; we must content ourselves, however, with giving a list of their names: Cornelius O’Neill,	Notre Dame, Indiana. • Edward DeGrote,	“ .	“ Frank Guthrie,	“	“ G.

students also, the latter may see what, in the estimation of an intelligent man, is the object of their coming to Notre Dame. We preface, the letter by only one word. It is written by the father of a numerous family,—by a man who holds a high position in the legal profession, and, we need not add, for the letter will show, by a well educated Christian: .			—,	, Aug. 31st, 1867. Rev. W. Corby, S. S. C., President University Notre Dame, Indiana : Ree. and Rear Sir.—I send my son, under the care of	, to be entered as a student in the University of Notre Danie. . Of course I have all the solicitude for his welfare, both spiritual and temporal, which is natural in the paternal heart. He is young, and of course needs constant super-, vision over his morals, as well as mental development ; but I have every confidence in the watchfulness, care, and discipline for which your University has acquired so wide a reputation, and hope that he may be found docile and observant of all the rules of the Institution, and that you may have no cause of serious complaint. _I&-is, perhaps, unnecessary for me to say that I desire, above all things, that he should be well grounded in the knowledge of our religion, and in its practice, exemplary. He has made his first Communion some time ago, and Ldesire that he should go to his duties regularly, and that he should be instructed in the value of the practice, not on account of any rule of the Institution, but on ac. pount of the spiritual advantages to be gained thereby. But, I see that my anxiety has led me into unnecessary suggestions on a point, which I feel every confidence will not“be neglected. You know what I mean and feel, and so let it go at that. I wish my son to pursue the regular classical course of your Institution until he shall have completed it. . - Yours, truly,		. . - Special Observations. ' All communications for The Scholastic Year, intended for publication, must arrive here the Thursday before the Saturday of publication. , All communications must be signed by the real name of the correspondent, who “may, however, choose another name as a signature to his article. As the “Administration” of .The Scholastic Year is entirely disconnected from that of the Ave Marta, all letters referring to The Scholastic Year should be addressed to	■ Rev. N. H. GILLESPIE, Ed. S. Y., Notre Name, Indiana.	’	LOCAL. Visit of Our Right Rev. Bishop.—Among the distinguished arrivals which have signalized the opening of classes at our University, we take pleasure in noticing that of Right Reverend Dr. Luers, Bishop of Fort Wayne, who arrived here-on Friday morning, on his way back to Fort Wayne. We are glad to say that our Bishop appeared to be enjoying excellent health and spirits. • Tiie Large Bell continues to be the chief attraction at Notre Dame. It has been found by experience already .that a great deal depends on the ringing. Some say the full, sound has never been brought out yet. It would be a good idea to have a regular field day at the bell—a sort of ringing tournament, to which all the classes and orders which compose our population—students of each of the three departments—apprentices to each trade, etc.—should send select men; and then we could find but who the best ringers are. If this idea is carried out, previous convocations must be held, and care taken by the electors to choose the most" athletic. At present it is the common opinion that the blacksmiths are the best ringers at Notre Dame, but even they were surpassed by the gentlemanly visitors who kindly volunteered to ring it last Sunday after Mass. A scale of inches should be fixed to the framework to mark how high the edge of the bell rises above it, so that the relative merits of the ringing may be determined with mathematical precision. ■ ■ The Eagle.—Many of our old friends will remember the Eagle of the saintly days of yore, which used to be a great object of interest at Notre Dame. For many years after the decease of this venerated old creature, the College was, without a feathered pet. There was a parrot in the office, if is true, and Brother Florentins has long been famous for his canary birds. But these were too individualized or local in their respective spheres to merit the name of universal favorites. We are happy to say, however, that Master Page of Milwaukee, in bringing a magnificent live bald Eagle to the College, has supplied the want so long felt. The Eagle is per: fectly reconciled to his change of quarters. We left him eating raw beef and doing well. Some

pretend to think that he is the original eagle mentioned as having been chased by the monkey all around the liberty pole to the air of “Fop goes th’e Weasel,” and there is apparently some reason for the belief. He certainly displays an open-beaked hostility7 to the advances of such college monkeys as have hitherto sought to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance, by poking their fingers .in between the bars of his cage. This ‘argues a deep-seated, and no doubt well-grounded, antipathy, such as would evidently result from the sad experience to which we have alluded.

An Act of Vandalism.—We are averse—most decidedly averse, to interfering with our neighbors’ affairs. But there are social rights to be considered, as w’ell as legal rights, and sometimes what is legally only private property becomes a matter of .public interest. For instance, has a man who has purchased a work of art inimitable of its kind—a painting by one of the old masters for instance—has such a man, we ask, the right ' wantonly to destroy or mutilate it, although he may be the legal possessor? In the name of all that is aesthetic w’e answer, “No!” What, then, must be our feelings at witnessing the destruction of a tree whose remarkable form has given rise to a long series of endearing associations to the sojourners at Notre Dame? We allude to the natural Cross in the garden behind St. Joseph’s Novitiate, hitherto an important feature of the landscape, as you look towards the College from the Northwest side of the lake. We noticed yesterday morning that the w’ood-cutters -wTe ought to say the Ostro goths—W’ere busy at its 'time-worn and venerated trunk, and they had already proceeded too far on their unhallowed work for the intercession of a friend to be of any avail. We hope that this is the last act of Vandalism that the authorities will tolerate. Our groves have already been too much reduced for the interests of the picturesque, and now that turf.has been substituted for wood in the important article of fuel, we can see no reasonable motive for their further decimation.
r
The List of Our Visitors has been crowded out this week. In the following number -we shall give it entire. We give them our thanks for the encouragement of their presence, and for the commendations they have been pleased to bestow’ upon all they have seen at Notre Dame and St. Mary’s.
A sad accident has prevented one of our students from returning at the commencement of classes. We refer to the well-known Junior, Marcus Foote, who, with a host of other smart, intelligent lads' holds his own with his venerable—(relatively)—brethren of the Senior Department.
Marcus was at home, enjoying his vacation as every student that studies hard during ten months of the year knows how to enjoy some sixty days of sport.	-
Unfortunately, he, one day toward the end of vacation, selected a railroad bridge as a good place for catching fish. There was plenty of room where he was sitting to allow the train to pass. However, as this was, we suppose, the first time he had fished at that place, he became alarmed at the approach of a train, and attempted to cross, thinking he had time to reach the end of the bridge before the train would arrive. He made a sad mistake ; the train -was on him; the engineer did all he could to save him, and much is due, no doubt, to his presence of mind. Death seemed inevitable; the locomotive caught the boy and hurled him from the track. He had escaped with his life.
After the train had passed by he-was found on the^track; he had received a severe wound on the foot, and until that is healed bis father does not wish him to return to Notre Dame.	-
All his old associates regret the accident, and may they all learn a lesson therefrom, viz: to go to no place without permission. For had the father of young Foote known that his son intended to select the bridge for his fishing place he would not have permitted him to go there.
When Marcus returns he will have a warm welcome from his old associates and fellow' students.	’	'	'

We regret that we are obi iged to go to press before receiving the account of the opening of classes of St. Mary’s.
The young ladies who visited the College with their parents before “settling down” at the Academy, and who'charmed us with their playing on the Grand Piano, in the College Parlor, have Ai ven us an exalted notion of their attainments in the musical line.
Next week we shall give an account of St. Mary’s—and- the parents of the young ladies will then be compensated for “ our failure” of this week.
