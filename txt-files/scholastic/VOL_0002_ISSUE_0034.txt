The Irish Language.
AN ESSAY, BY F. 8.
[continued;]
Right Rev. Doctor O’Brien, Bishop of Cloyne, in the article on Gaelic antiquities in his “ Irish-English Dictionary, ” says: “ There is nothing more evident from the most Ancient monuments of the Irish nation, than that the national name of the first Celts who came to Ireland (whether they arrived there immediately from Gaul, or rather, after remaining for some length of time in the greater British isle, as Mr. Lhuyd gives good grounds to think) was Gall, in the singular, and Gail, in the plural; and that their language was called Galic or Gailic. We should not in the mean time forget that it is to this change made in the words Galic or Gailic, doubtless by the heathen bards, who inserted the letter d—as Gae-dhil, Gaidhil—that we owe the important discovery, necessarily reserved to their successors who embraced Christianity. Of tjiose illustrious personages, Gadel and Gadelus, the [former an usher under the royal schoolmaster Pheniusa Farsa, King of Scythia, in his famous school on the Plain of Sennaar, where this Gadel invented the Irish alphabet and the Gadelian language, so-called, as it is pretended, from his name; and the latter a grandson of that King by his son Niull, who married Scota, daughter of Pharaoh Cingris, as the bards call him, instead of Cinchres, King of Egypt, under whose reign they tell us Moses and our Gadelus were cotemporaries, and great friends; and from Gadelus the learned bards gravely assure us that the Irish derive their name of Gadelians, who they tell us were also called Scots, from his wife, the Egyptian princess Scota. This discovery, I have said, was necessarily reserved to the Christian bards, as their
heathen predecessors 'most certainly could have no notion .of the Plain of Sennaar, of Pharaoh, or of Moses, objects not to be known but from the holy scriptures, .or some writings derived from them, such as those of Josephus, Philo, etc., never known to the Irish bards before Christianity;. I have remarked in another work, not as yet published, that the Christian bards did. notlose much time in availing themselves of the sacred history to frame this story, inasmuch as we find it .word for word in the scholiast on the life of St Patrick by Fiach, Bishop of Sleipte, one of that Saint’s earliest disciples; which scholiast the learned and judicious Colgan places towards the end .of the sixth century. This date is much earlier than that of the manuscript called Leabhar Gabhdla, or the Book of Conquests, wherein our story now mentioned is embellished with further circumstances.	.
“The Irish bards or versificators, who frequently wanted to stretch out words, . by multiplying their syllables according to the exegencies of their rhymes, devised the method of throwing in between the two vowels an adventitious consonant, generally a d or g, aspirated by A, in order to stretch and divide' the two vowels onto two different syllables; and when the rule Gaol, U cadi, ague leathan le leathan—“ Slender with slender, and broad with broad”—came into use, the word Galic or Gailic, and Gaill, required the insertion of e or i, by which means it turned out Gaidhil, Gaedhilic. Before I have done with the words Gaill and Gailic, I think it pertinent to remark that notwithstanding the complex and inform shape of the words into which they have been changed, yet the originals from which they were derived are still preserved in their primitive simplicity by the very formation of the former words, which is very nearly the same as that of the latter, inasmuch as the adventitious letters (dh) are not pronounced.	■
“Weare assured by Tacitus (Anal; 2)and by Pliny
268	THE SCHOLASTIC YEAR.
(L 7, c. 56,) that the primitive number of letters brought first into Greece by Cadmus, and. afterwards to the aborigines of Italy by Evander the Arcadian, consisted but of sixteen. Hence I presume it may rationally be. concluded that the Gadelian language, or Gaelic, still preserves the primitive sixteen letters first invented by Gadel, as the Irish alphabet consists of sixteen, with the exclusion of the letter P. This letter is called in Irish Peith-bog. Grammarians do not inform us from what tree it borrows this appellation, and O’Flaherty is equally silent concerning it. But it seems quite obvious that ’ it can mean nothing else than Beith-bog, or B so/Z,—that is to say, P is "bnly a soft or mollifying way of expressing B; and the reason of it is, because originally they were the same letter, and P was not used in the Irish language before the knowledge of the Latin was introduced into the island in the time of Saint Patrick. In the old parchments we find these two letters taken indifferently, one for the other, by which we may plainly see how just is the remark of ■ Mr. Lhuyd, in his Comparative Etymology.
“There are,” says he, “scarcely any words in the Irish, besides what are borrowed from, the Latin or some other language, that begin with it; insomuch that in an ancient Alphabetical Vocabulary I have by me, it is entirely omitted.” Besides, we find in the old Norwegian alphabet, which is the ancient Runic alphabet, that there is no difference between the figure of the characters B and P. The Greeks wrote them indifferently, one for another; as, (Gr.) baiein, for patein; and the Latins have followed their example; as, (Lat.) bicron, for picron. And the Greeks to observe it, by the by, have in like manner taken their burgos, a tower or castle, from the Phoenicians, their first instructors in letters, in whose language it is borg, which is plainly of the same root with the Irish word brog, or brag, a strong or fortified place—also a lord’s court or . castle; whence the French bourg, the German burgh, and the English borough, do in a larger sense signify a town. By what has been observed, we plainly see that P and B were originally the same letter, and that peith-bog can be nothing else than B soft or B modified.”
Mr. Lhuyd remarks that a considerable number of those words whose initial letter is P in the British begin with C, and the like affinity may be observed between the Greek and Latin and the Irish language; as (Ir.) Caisg and Casga, Easter; Greek and Latiu, Pascha, and Chal-
daice, Pascha, which is derived from the Hebrew, Pasach or Phase; (Lat.) transitus, the Passover.
Mr. Baxter remarks that the oldest Brigantes, whom he esteems the first inhabitants of Britain, never used in their language, the sound of the letter P, which was afterwards introduced by the Belgic Britons.
“ If the old Brigantes were really the first inhabitants of Britain, it would follow that they were a part of the Gadelian or Gaulish colony which went over to Ireland, and whom Mr. Lhuyd evidently proves to have been the first inhabitants of all that part of Great Britain now comprehending England and Wales. “It hath been observed by eminent writers that the Lingua Prisca, or the primitive Latin, was chiefly formed upon the Celtic; and the truth of this assertion is abundantly confirmed throughout the whole of .all the Irish dictionaries. This being premised as a fact, it follows that the subsequent Celtic, still preserved in the Irish,—viz: clumh, cuilse (corruptly cuisle), corcur or curcur, eland, coip, obuir, secht, were respectively the originals upon which the Latin words pluma, pulsus, purpura, planta, copia (copiaruni), opus, operis, septem, have been formed, as mere derivations from their respective Celtic archetypes above written.” This indeed plainly appears from their consisting of a greater number of syllables. Hence, it may rationally be conjectured that the primitive Latin in the Lingua Prisca, formed upon the above Celtic originals, were cluma, culsis, curcura, clanta, cobiee, -arum, obus, oberis, sectem.
The same identity may be observed by any philologist between the language of Ireland and many of the European dialects as reflecting in the mirror of the Gaelic vocabulary, clearly proving its great antiquity.	•

Eureka!
When Archimedes leaped from the bath, and carried away by the inspiration of a new idea— the great scientific principle of specific gravity— he forgot for the moment the requirements of fallen nature, and by mental exaltation transformed, externally at least, to the state of Adam in Paradise—he ran home through the streets shouting “ Eureka! -Eureka!” little did he dream that a wretched little semi-occasional monthly in Illinois would pervert that glorious exclamation to be a cloak for scurrility. The Ehireka College Vidette, giving its readers eight pages, each 1 foot by 9 inches, a month, and comparing itself with us, giving our readers four numbers, each of eight pages, 10 inches by 7, presumes to say that our relative proportions are those of a lion and a dog—the lion being the Eureka College Vidette! Now, leaving out the eight as a com-
June in commemoration- of- the tw'enty-fifth anniversary of the foundation- of this University.
For some weeks past, we had, indeed, noticed quite an active stir among certain “ divinities” of old Jove’s Court, (now, however, dwelling in or about Notre Dame, in mortal flesh, we believe,) all diligently engaged in1 astronomical observations,- taking particular interest in certain constellations, and in a recent-peculiar mode of locomotion, or velocipedity. But the mystery of all this is-now quite clear to us: last night revealed to our wondering and at the same time delighted gaze the rendering of one of the most— if not the most astounding tragical event recorded in Dame Fable’s chronicles, in which the “gods” of high Olympus appear, some in avenging anger, others in fatal rashness, others still in very sad plight. . . ; nothing less,, indeed* but the' representation', in’ a grand and vivid style, of the rash career and lamentable death of the son of Phoebus, who, attempting to ride the chariot of the Sun, and unskillfully man-

Yes, last night,. April 27th, of the year, of Jubilees 1869, we had the great pleasure of assisting at the first preliminary celebration of the Silver Jubilee of this Institution, given under the auspices of the above-mentioned Club. We are sure of rightly interpreting the sentiments of all those who were fortunate enough to witness the performance, ■ when we say that the MeZZow-drama was exceedingly well written, combining refined witticism in expression,- somewhat eccentric picturesqueness in design, and a slight touch of extravaganza throughout, and . that it was rendered by the young actors—all members of the Club—in a manner highly creditable to
themselves, and to those who trained them-We would establish the following gradations: elocution, good; singing, tolerable; dancing, better;. gestures, best.
We - understand that the “ Play” is the production (and a very orginal- one it is, in more than one sense) of the talented and highly imaginative director of the Silver Jubilee Club: the style is unmistakably station throughout, i. e., earnest, graceful, very fanciful,, somewhat wildly extravagant, and exceedingly laughable-As a proof of it, we will take the liberty of transcribing for the benefit of absent friends—readers of The Scholastic Year,—the programme for the occasion, got up in a grand style by that classicaland romantic? gentleman.

Now, dear readers, that you have perused that splendid programme, what do you think of it ? Is it not by itself a rich thing, and one well calculated to stamp its author with the'mark of originality and witticism ? Professor, give us more of that sort of amusing treat which gives boundless wings to our languid imagination and excites our risibles.
Such was the peculiar nature of the performance, that it is difficult to express adequately our high appreciation of it and mention its varied excellencies. We will, however, notice the following parts or characters as deserving, in our opinion, special commendation:
Mr. W. A. Walker, as “ Jupiter,” behaved with the majesty to be expected from so exalted a personage. He “bossed” the other “gods” around with an energy and decision that showed he was quite competent to fill his responsible situation. Afterwards, in the part of “Tony,”, he was so completely transformed that the audience needed to consult theirprogrammes to convince them that it was the same performer.
Mr. Dickinson’s “Apollo” was a breathing Belvidere. His appearance in the prologue, while making his address to the “ Hours,” was splendid; his singing, both in the character of the “Sun” and in the interludes, was such as to sustain his well-earned reputation as a singer.’
Mr. W. P. McClain, as “ Phaeton,” managed his fiery steed with a dexterity far excelling that of his prototype—if Ovid’s account be true,—and he met his “ Untimely End ” with the courage of a hero. Many were the fears expressed that he
had “hurt himself,” but he knows how to do it, and to do it gracefully and artistically—without danger.
■ Mr. Akin was an elegant “ Mercury,” and appeared to equal advantage in the afterpiece as “ Marlow.”
Mr. G. Me. Atkinson, in the afterpiece, also realized to the life the ideal of a fine, old-fash-oned, hospitable and courteous gentleman.
Mr. J. M. Moriarty gave “Bacchus” his due, but it was in the beautiful song of “ Be a Many chorused by the Club, that his finest point was made during the evening. This vocal piece is decidedly one of the finest that we ever heard from the stage of Washington Hall.
Mr. James Cunnea showed much skill in forging the armor of “Mars,” and in beating the anvil in perfect accord with a celestial Orphean concert.
As for the remainder of the long list of “ divinities” and “constellations,” not forgetting Doctor Pangloss, the only mortal man in the drama, they all contributed to form a tout ensemble that elicited the approbation of alL The “Dog of Bootes” has the merit of being the first quadruped that ever made his appearance before a Notre Dame audience.
We must not forget to mention that the scene where the “ Hours” were made to revolve around the “Son of the Sun” was so felicitously and gracefully rendered that it was vociferously applauded by the audience and acceptably encored by the actors.
It is but just also to make mention of the exeel-

• lent music furnished on the occasion "by the Notre Dame University Comet Band and the Orchestra. We take special pleasure in directing attention to the fact that the latter has of late 'received very efficient reinforcements. Among the young newcomers we particularly noticed Masters Mark Foote, Joseph Rumely, and Vincent Hack-mann,—all very small, but very talented, little gents—little musical prodigies in fact. All honor and prosperity to the Orchestra of Notre Dame and to the Silver Jubilee Club!! J. C. C.
St. Cecilia Philomathean Association,
The twenty-eighth regular meeting was held Tuesday evening, April 16th. At this meeting Master Edward Bahm read, in a clear voice, an essay on “ Happiness.” It was a fine composition, abounding in fine thoughts, well developed and clothed in neat and appropriate language. Master P. J. O’ConneU’s essay on “Knowledge is the best Riches ” was very well written, and his ideas very correct. Master O’Connell is rapidly winning his way in the walks of literature. Master M. Foote’s “ Choice Reading ” was one of the best essays ever read before the Society. It was replete with sensible thoughts, and contained many beautiful passages. We wish that all those who read nonsensical trash could have heard what he said on that subject. They would then, very probably, procure something solid, and enrich their minds with the real treasures of knowledge. Next followed the declamations. Master John Coppinger spoke the “Destruction of Sennacherib.” He astonished us not a little by his improvement in elocution since we last heard him. He has good elocutionary powers and only requires practice to bring them out. Master M. Mahony amused us a good deal in a comic selection. Master F. Spencer did very well, considering that it"was his first appearance. Master C. Burdell’s “ Marmion and Douglas ” could scarcely be done better. Master J. McGuire surpassed our expectation. Master T. Arrington delighted the members by his personations. MasterH. O’Neill gave us “Excelsior” in good style. Master P. J. O’Connell’s selection entitled “ Celtic Wit” was a masterpiece of declamation. Master Vincent Hackmann closed the exercises by displaying his musical powers in a choice selection, to the great delight of all.
The twenty-ninth regular meeting came off Monday evening, April 26th. The debate appointed for this evening was postponed on account of the absence of some of the debaters. It will take place at the next regular meeting. Declamations and recitations were the order of the evening. Time and space will only allow us to mention a few of the prominent members. Master D. J. Wile, who was absent a few weeks, and whose presence in the meeting was a sourcq of delight to all the members, came forward and delivered with earnestness “Phillips’ speech on Napoleon.” On taking his seat he was greeted with great applause. Masters C. Burdell and Harold Hays did full justice to their selections. As the time for retiring came, the members— highly delighted with the exerci see—reluctantly adjourned.
