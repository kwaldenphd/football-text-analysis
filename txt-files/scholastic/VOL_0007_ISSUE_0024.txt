Sappiness.
What is happiness? Where is it found? These are two very simple questions apparently; but on a second reading their simplicity wears away and we have two very difficult ones. There is not a man we meet who has not his own idea of happiness. Put the questions to the merchant, and he tells us that happiness is the possession of wealth, and that it is found only in wealth. The man Ofthe world sees it in an easy life, abundance of the good things of this world, a great name, amusements, and -iso bn; the student sees it in a diploma; and in like manner the politician, the doctor, the lawyer, each has his own ideal of. happiness, and tells us that it consists in the acquisition of .some particular object for which he has been working since he began the great battle of life.
, But one of these men is just after getting the reward of his lifelong labprs—the great prize for which he worked so bravely,—and now, we suppose, be is going to rest himself and live at-his ease henceforward. Watch him: there he is in the .possession of his treasure, in the full enjoyment of it! Is he happy? It is strange! he does not seem to be.' He.seems restless—in fact discontented! What is themeaning of this? No sooner are his fondest hopes, his wildest , dreams realized, than he is dissatisfied with the realization. Ah! he is not happy! nor does he find that true happiness which he imagined was in the prize he labored for so long. The novelty of the object is fading away—and, besides, just as he came into the possession of it, another rose to his sight, “away, for away” perhaps, but not too far he thinks for him to spend the rest of his life struggling to obtain it And so it is with the world. Discontent seems to dog the footsteps of man, and succeeds in embittering every pleasure which he marks out for him-sel£ The happiness found in this world is bunted. In the very centre of it we find its bitterness. Adam was not happy in Eden: and if we trace the history of the world from his day to the present time, we will find discontent to be the lot of even its most prominent and fortunate members. David, Solomon, Alexander, Caesar, Napoleon, Charlemagne, etc., are all examples of the restless spirit of man.
But where is true happiness to be found? Divines tell us that there are two kinds of happiness of which we are capable in this life; the one external, the other internal. External happiness consists in the enjoyment of all those things which are agreeable to the flesh—good health, riches, honors, the esteem of others, etc., in all of which Solomon saw “vanity and vexation of mind!” Internal happiness consists in a contented and satisfied mind, one that is peaceful, and “free from?-theboisterous storms of violent passions.” To obtain the true happiness we must renounce all earthly things and httahoff our inegular at
tachments to the world. Then will we obtain the “Peace I leave you.”	-	T. 0.
The Suoalyptu Tm. -
A TREE THAT DESTROYS MALARIA.
At the last meeting of the French Academy of Science a very interesting paper was read by M. Gimbert. Ito subject was the alleged febrifugal properties of the Ans* tralian tree, eucalyptus globulus, which is said to have the curious and valuable power of destroying the malaafoaik element in any atmosphere where it grows. The speaiata in question is one of that fomily indigenous to NewSosfih Wales, which the colonists call gum trees. They shoot very quickly and to an enormous height, some of theta reaching 150 feet, with a girth of from twenty-five to fori^, The sparse and strangely-twisted foliage grows in a thin crown at the top of the pillar-like stem, but the characteristic of the whole genus is the rapid habit of increase, seen equally in the “iron bark,” the “blue gum,” and this particular specimen the eucalyptus globulus. The tree in question absorbs an immense deal of water from the earth and at the same time emits an aromatic odor which has, perhaps, something to do with the beneficial influence attributed to it. Where it is thickly planted in marshy tracts the subsoil is said to be drained in a little' while as though by extensive piping. Miasma ceases, we are told, wherever the eucalyptus flourishes. It has been tried for this purpose at the Cape, and within two or three years has completely changed the climatic condition of the unhealthy parts of that colony. Somewhat later its plantation was undertaken on a large scale in various parts of Algeria. At a form twenty miles from Algeria, situated on the banks of a river, and noted for its extremely pestilential air, about 13,000 eucalypti were planted. In the same year, at the time when the fever season used to set in, not a single case occurred, yet the trees were not more than nine feet high. Since then complete immunity from fever has been maintained. In the neighborhood of Constantins, it is also stated, was anothernoted fever-spot, covered with marsh-water both in winter and summer; in five years the whole ground was dried up by 14,000 of these tree^ and formers and children enjoy excellent health. Throughout Cuba marsh diseases are rapidly disappearing from all the unhealthy districts where this tree has been introduced. A station-house, again, at one end of a rail way viaduct in the Department ot the Var, was so pestilential that the officials could not be kept there linger than a year; forty of the trees were planted, and it is now as healthy as any other place on the line. Such are some of the fitato brought forward by M. Gimbert. If they are well established, it would be most desirable to try whether the eues-lyptus would thrive on the west coast of Africa, and other

■ malarious-districts of the warmer latitudes. It is affirmed that the sunflower possesses a similar capacity to dry up the subsoil and neutralize miasma. Nor should botanists ■neglect these suggestions. There are more'wonders yet in the vegetable world than are dreamed of in their philos-'ophy. How passing strange, for example, is that property of the pawpaw tree to turn meat tender! A joint of mutton steeped in a solution of its juice becomes instantly succulent, and the flesh of animals fed upon its leaves “melts in the mouth” upon cooking.—London Telegraph.
. Love’s First Dream.
Chaste is the sheen of the golden ore, And the hue of the diamond bright, Fair is the valley and ancient wold, That glistens ’neath freedom’s light.
Warm is the’ heart that mingles its blood, In the billows of glory’s stream,
But more clear, more bright, more pure and fair,
• Are the visions of Love’s First Dream.
Who has not felt, in the glow of youth,	•
A throb for a face divine,
A longing to labor, and watch, and wait, For garlands some brow to twine ?
How bright were those moments of bygone days I How fair was each golden gleam,
Which lighted our pathways in times now flown, When basking in Love’s First Dream!
Ah! dear were those hours now flown fore’er, Sweet, sweet were those golden years, When the flashing eye, and the blushing cheek, Ne’er felt of those scalding tears;
When the world seemed bright, and no friend untrue, And the meadows were fair and green,
And our hearts were nigh bursting with joy untold, When basking in Love’s First Dream.
But they’re gone fore’er, with their train of hope, Those visions of joy untold,
The green mound mute, and the shadowy tomb, Care not for the clink of gold.
They hide in their breast, in the cold, cold clay, O’er which the lone night-owls scream,
The heart that I sought for in days now flown, The idol of Love’s First Dream.
My hair, once dark as the raven’s plume, ' Is white as the flakes of snow,
- The brightest gems of the earth are mine, , .But still I am bowed with woe. ■	’
Come back! 0 come, with your tide of love, Sweet hours of bliss supreme!
Oh! take my wealth, and my lands, my all, But leave me sweet Love’s First Dream.
I sorrow in vain; but my Saviour meek Doth all things in justice kind,
I’ll weep no more for the absent one, But bear in my heart and mind
That .we’ll meet again, in the realms above, Inhere partings are never seen,
And where faithful hearts will bask fore’er, In the sunshine of Love’s First Dream.] Celt.

Much Ado about Nothing.
At ten o’clock by the watchman’s stroke, '	" Harwich sat thinking of the time,	■
When “Joe,” his pen in desperation broke. Should tremble at his rhyme.
We never attempted to write poetry, for from our infancy we bore in mind the evident truthfulness of Horace when he said: “ Vd homo insanit rdeersuafacit"; but we cannot refrain on this auspicious occasion from modifying “slightly” some celebrated verses for the benefit of one who courts the muses very frequently.
We are sorry indeed that Harwich is a poet and attacks us so unmercifully with his poetic effusions; for as he in a very bombastic manner speaks of “fair fields and no favor,” and endeavors to strangle us with words of a boaconstrictor character, we several times felt like balancing ourself on our tiptoes, sitting on our heels and giving vent to our feelings in a torrent of tears and a thunder of sobs. We are not so far gone however as all that, and console ourself with the pleasing thought that we have made at least one fellow-being happy by giving him a chance to gratify his ambition even at the cost of exposing his own faults and acknowledging his own inconsistencies. Blinded by excitement and dazzled by the imaginary brilliancy of his weapons and armor, he makes a fearful attack, which results in the explosion of immense quantities of powder— but not a shot is noted or a trace of its presence seem Harwich, use your field-glass better, for you have attacked “Misstated Facts” instead of the fortress of “Mistakes of Fact;” and do not, we pray you, endeavor to make use of our expended ammunition by putting it up in another form and directing it against us. It is entirely “ too thin ” to translate our paragraphs into Latin and send them back to us as a reply.	.
We are extremely grieved to have you accuse us of having two opponents,—for “ two against one is not fair,”— and then also to be so unkind as to say that we embody in ourself and blazon forth the subtlety and sophistry of one opponent and the consequence of another. Which one of these is you, Harwich ?
As to our autobiography, we think it most proper and just that we should be privileged to compose that ourself, and to make our own important self the subject of it and not our early years. Perhaps you have a new theory in regard to autobiographies as well as to “it” having three halves.
With reference to that gage that was thrown at your feet, we are positively at a loss to understand you; for in the first place we never had such a thing as a gage of the class of which you speak, and in the second place we trust we would have better sense than to attempt to throw such a thing in that direction. There is considerable discussion going on with reference tonarrow gauges and wind gauges, we presume yours belongs to the latter class.
Now, Harwich, do not get angry, but if you talk about dancing, we are with you on .that point, and can dance anything from a“Harwichian Hornpipe” to a “Joe King Fling.” If you shake hands we will let you slide down our cellar door.	“ Joe ”
An Iowa editor has a letter from a subscriber, who writes: “I don’t want your paper any longer.” The editor says this is to be regretted, as he has arranged to make the paper about six inches longer in a few weeks.

A Chapter ia the Life of Pope Sixtus V.
Father Michael Angelo Selleri, a Franciscan friar, going in the beginning of February, 1531, to preach during the Lent session at Ascoli, lost his way near Le Grotte,and • coming to a point where four lanes met, could not tell which to take. As he was looking around for somebody to direct him, a litile boy, who was attending a herd of swine, came running forward and tendered his services. The friar cheerfully accepted them, and asked him the road to Ascoli. “I’ll soon show you the way thither,” replied the boy, and immediately began to run before him. As they went along the answers the urchin gave to Father Michael’s questions were so smart and pertinent, and accompanied with so much good humor, that the friar was quite charmed with him, and could not conceive how a child, who had no highe, employment than looking after hogs, should have suchar Share of sense and good manners.
When Father Michael had got into his road again, ho thanked Felix for his trouble, and would have dismissed him with a reward, but he kept running forward without seeming to take any notice of what he said, which obliged the friar to ask him in a jocose manner whether he designed to go with him to the town? “Yes,” said the boy, “ not only to Ascoli, but to the end of the world, with a great deal of pleasure;” and, upon this, he took occasion to tell the friar that the poor circumstances of his parents would not allow them to send him to school, as he desired; that he earnestly wished somebody belonging to a convent would take him as a waiting boy, and he would serve him to the utmost of his power, provided he would teach him to read.
To try the boy a little further, Father Michael asked him “if he would take upon him the habit of his order?” Felix, for that was the boy’s name, immediately answered that he would; and though the friar set forth to him in the most frightful colors all the mortifications and austerities he would be obliged to undergo, he boldly replied “he would willingly suffer anything, if he would make him a scholar.” The priest, surprised at his courage and resolution, thought he must be under the influence of some superior inspiration, and resolved to take hime along with him. He told him, however, first to conduct his hogs back to his master, and come to meet him at the convent of Ascoli. But Felix would not be persuaded to leave him on any account. “ The hogs,” said he, “ will find their way home themselves, when night comes on.” The friar yielding, they continued their journey, and arrived at Ascoli in the evening.
The fraternity received the preacher with great civility, but were surprised to see him attended by a ragged boy. When he told them by what accident he picked him up, and with what extraordinary zeal he had followed him thither, the warden had the curiosity to send for and ask him several questions. The replies which young Felix made were such that he appeared even more extraordinary than Father Michael had represented him to be. Such an examination before a reverend community might well have disconcerted a person of riper years, but Felix answered without any hesitation, and with an air of truth and- simplicity that could not be suspected of any artifice or contrivance. Everything he said tended to persuade, them of his call, and of the ardent desire he had to become a preacher of the Gospel, if they qualified him for it. The
Whole brotherhood, convinced that the hand, of God unmistakably appeared in the affair, conjured the warden not to overlook so remarkable an interposition of Providence when his attention to it might be the means of raising np a man that would, perhaps, prove an honor to their order.	'
The brotherhood argued rightly. The poor ragged boy, who thus accidentally obtained an introduction into their community rose afterwards to the Papal Chair, by the title of Pope Sixtus N.-^Percy Anecdotes.
Curran at a Debating Society. .
Curran’s account of his introduction and debut at a deba? ting society is the identical “first appearance” of hundreds. “Upon the first of our assembling,” he says, “I attended, my foolish heart throbbing with the anticipated honor of being styled ‘the learned member that opened the debate,* or ‘ the very eloquent gentleman who has just sat down? All day the coming scene had been flitting before my fancy,, and cajoling it. My ear already caught the glorious melody of ‘ Hear him! hear him! ’ Already I was practicing how to steal a sidelong glance at the tear of generous approbation bubbling in the eyes of my little auditdry,—never suspecting, alas! that a modern eye may have so little affinity with moisture that the finest -gunpowder may be dried upon it. I stood up; my mind was stored With about a folio volume of mattery but I wanted a preface, and for want: of a preface the volume was never published. I stood up, trembling through every fibre; but remembering that in this I was but imitating Tully, I took courage, and had actually proceeded almost as far as ‘ Mr. Chairman,’ when to my astonishment and terror, I perceived that every eye was ri vetted upon me. There were only six or seven present, and the little room could not have contained as many, more; yet was it, to my panic-stricken imagination, as if £ were the central object in nature, and assembled millions were gazing upon me in breathless expectation.' I became* dismayed and dumb. My friends cried ‘Hear him!’ but there was nothing to hear. My lips, indeed, went through’ the pantomime of articulation; but I was like the unfortunate fiddler at the fair, who coming to strike up the solo that -was to ravish every ear, discovered that an enemy had maliciously soaped his bow; or rather, like poor Punch, as I once saw him, grimacing a soliloquy, of which his prompter had most indiscreetly neglected to administer-the words.” Such was the debut of “ Stuttering Jack Curran,” or “ Oratpr Mum,” ashe was waggishly styled; but not" many months elapsed ere the sun of his eloquence burst forth in dazzling splendor.	•
Not long since a very nervous lady took passage at the Tip-Top House, White Mountains to descend by the almost, perpendicular railroad. Her fears were apparent to every one, and the following unique dialogue took place between .her and the conductor: Lady—Mr. Conductor, how do-you hold these cars when, you want to make a stop ? C.— Madam we apply, the brake which you see there. Ladyr-r Suppose, Mr. Conductor, that brake should give way,-what-do you do then? C.—Madame we then apply the doubleacting brake, which you see at the other end of the cars. Lady.—But Mr. Conductor, suppose that break should not be sufficient to check the cars, where will we go then? I C.—Madame, that depends entirely upon how you have I lived in this world!

Under this modest announcement the advanced pupils in the Conservatory of Music at St. Mary’s Academy gave, last Saturday evening, a very creditable exhibition of their talents. It was made evident to us that much has been done at St. Mary’s Academy towards rendering music a popular art, and that the present state of efficiency which its Conservatory has reached results from persevering effort on the part of the authorities of the Academy, the devoted-nest of the teachers, and application and dose study of the pupils. What pleased us most in last Saturday’s Entertainment was not so much the excellence of the performance in Its fowl as the feet that each of the young musicians seemed to understand thoroughly her part, was femlllar with it, and rendered it in a masterly and pleasing manner. Music which is badly understood, from want of study, must necessarily be badly treated, and as such is to be execrated. Half perfection in music does not satisfy— it leaves too much to be desired. The ear is keen, hard to ploise. It discovers feulta much quicker than the eye, and is very unforgiving. It matters little whether the half of a splendid Mass or of an opera is rendered masterly if the other half jars the ears of the listeners. It is worse yet, perhaps, in the making up of a musical programme to Intermingle the good with the bad, harmony with discord. But we are going too for—rather too near. We meant to speak of the splendid musical entertainment given by the music pupils of St. Mary’s Conservatory.
The programme opened with a vocal duett from Doni-settt—the light, tripping Donisetti. Misses L. Black and L. Henrotin, whose excellent voices blend so admirably, rendered the piece in a very pleasing manner. The “Capriole Brilllantc” of Wollenhaupt next followed. It was executed by Mias R. Spier as well, we should think, as the most exacting critic could desire. The song “ Pm pmitis" of Rossini, solemn and sad, well adapted to the sympathetic voice which rang it out. Miss E. Haggerty’s voice appeared to us admirably qualified for such style of music,
though we have no doubt it is as good in others. “ Gratia* agimut tibi” by Guglielmo, was next sung, by Miss.E. O’Connor, whose sweet notes did full justice to the piece. Her voice has a peculiar softness which renders it very pleasing. Paniaine from Thalberg’s Lucrezia Borgia followed. It was played very accurately and in brilliant style, by Miss Libbie Black. “ Ernani ” was then sung by the gifted Nellie Foote, whose voice is naturally excellent, and did justice to the piece. Grand aria from “ Mignon,” by Thomas, was next in order. We think it was the most efficient Vocal piece of the eVenfog. It fell to the lot of Miss L. West, who rendered Filina, ‘‘Zo son Titania Honda ” in a most agreeable manner. Fantaisie “ Moses in Egypt” was then played by Miss J. Walker. This piano piece seemed to us the most difficult performance of the evening. It was truly a splendid execution, and reflected great credit on the performer. A chorus from Mendelssohn ended the Entertainment. Each af the soloists of the evening alternated with the full chorus by the whole Class. It was, like the rest of the programme, excellent throughout. ______________

We regret to have it to say that some of the prindpal pieces on the programme, which were to be rendered by the Orchestra, had to be omitted owing to the usual disappointments to which we are auldected by that brilliant but capricious organisation. We regret this the more, that what little music we heard from them showed remarkable progress and efficiency.
The Brass Band had two new pieces on its list, and these were rendered in lively style. Poeo piano would add much to the beauty of their music in the Hall, but brass instruments, as well as reed ones, are somewhat rebdllous, and demand long practice before they can be subdued into perfect obedience. The Notre Dame University Brass Band will ere long fttlfll all our expectations in thia regard, and we look already upon it as equal to any similar organisation in the State.
A Piano Solo—“ Oberon"—was next given by Master Otto, our talented young pianist. It was pleasingly rendered. It is evldent that Master Otto haa rare talent, and wetruathe willcontinuetbimproveiU	„

“ 0 Cara Memoria” Wasthen rendered by our talented Junior violinist; C. Burger,'accompanied on the piano by C. Otto. Master Burger is also a musical genius who will be heard from some time or other.. Me rendered his piece in a manner-which showed great familiarity with the bow and confidence in himself. We follow his progress With great interest. • Master W, Ohlen played a theme on his piccolo, accompanied by Master Otto on the piano; the young musician is master of his instrument, and, like his predecessors, received hearty applause.
Master Freese followed next in a Violin piece from Don-L	izetti’s opera “Fille du Regiment.” Master Freese has
a fine handling of the bow and plays with grace and taste. His effort was very good. The string quartette “ Preciosa ” was Omitted, there not being a quorum. Mr. Otto then played the Spinhard Waltz, by Strauss; it was excellent throughout. Master Otto deserves actually much credit for being the only pianist of our Music Department who condescends to play for us at our public entertainments. We think .that several others could Share the honor with him. A quickstep by the Band ended the matinee.
A polka by the Brass Band came next in order, and appeared to us one of the best and most difficult morceaux ■	given this year by the Band. They played with taste, and
nottoo/orte. .................. •
In the first part of the programme two pieces were omitted, viz., a brass quartette which would have been one of* th eflnest selections of the evening, and the Orchestra overture “Poet and Peasant,” which was rendered in the second part of the programme. The overture is a splendid composition, and the members of the Orchestra apt	peered equal to it.
1	A few remarks by the President followed. After com.	plimenting the performers of the evening, he alluded to
!	the lack of vocal pieces on the programme—an omission
i	due to the fact that the Vocal Class had had no practice
•	during the year so as to be able to take part in our musical
;	and other public entertainments. He encouraged the stu.	dents to join the Choral Society about to be formed, and
;	trusted that they would cheerfully respond to its call.
Rev. Mr. Henrion, whose experience in musical matters s ■ and connection with choral societies in Europe entitle him • }	to the f\ill confidence of our music-loving students, has
p	been intrusted with the charge of the new Choral Society.
■	We have no doubt his expectations and ours will be real-
iaed, and that many students will take advantage of the opportunity offered them.

Pleadings of theVSacred Heart of Jesus. From the French. With tin Introduction by a Catholic Priest. The Catholic Publication Society, Now York.
This little book of devotion, we learn from the Introduction, was approved in the original by two Bishops of Rode* Mgrs. Girard and Croizier, and the translation is approved by his Eminence Cardinal Cullen, Archbishop of Dublin, and the Rt Rev. Dr. Walsh, Bishop of Kildare, and Leigh-lin. The book contains thirty-three meditations on the Sacred Heart, in which our Blessed Lord speaks to the soul —or, as the title of the work suggests, pleads with the soul. Each Pleading is followed by a few reflections, for the soul to make; then a Practice, or some good work to be done in honor of the Sacred lle»rt |3 indieated; and the whole ends
with an Example, in which is related a trait in the life of some saint or saintly person devoted to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF STUDIES.
The examination of the various Classes, conducted on the plan explained in a recent issue of The Scholastic, was quite successful, and fully justified our hopes that thoroughness, combined with the least expenditure of time, might be secured by the plan adopted. We give below the results, premising a few words of explanation.
1st The figure opposite each name indicates the average per cent obtained by the one whose name precedes it, the several per cents, obtained in his various studies being added together and the sum divided by the number of studies pursued by him during the session, fractions omitted.
2nd. This average does not in all cases indicate theL student’s actual, standing, being much lower, in many instances, than it would be had he been examined in all his studies; but, being absent from Examination in some studies, in which he consequently received 0 for his per cent., his general average is considerably lowered.
3d. In order to distinguish between those whose low per cent, resulted from absence and those who merit it for lack of diligence in their studies, a stair (*) after a name will indicate absence from Examination in some studies. The word after a name indicates that the one so marked was not examined in any of his studiee—being excused, in moet.cases, for some good reason....
4th. The promotions made in the various Claas^s will appear in the next number of The Scholastic.

'	■	—Average of Class, 66.
Total Average, SO- ‘	,
I have to say ,in conclusion, that with very few exceptions the Students acquitted themselves very creditably in the late Examination. The matters proposed in each class covered the entire field gone over during the previous five mouths, and each, student was obliged to work without assistance from any quarter. The examination was severe, and the results fully as good as could be expected.
The Second Session opens under the most promising auspices, and, Heaven blessing the efforts of our earnest, industrious students, we are confident that the Examination next June will be even more creditable to the students and gratifying to the Faculty than the one just concluded.
The Faculty, of course, require no praise from me; they labor for love of the work they are doing, and this is their highest praise, while it is at the same time a guarantee that their work is well and thbroughly done.
M. B. Brown, C. S. C., Director of Studies.
The list of newly arrived students and the Report of the Notre Dame Philharmonic Society are unavoidably crowded out this week.
All Around.
Sleighing was tolerable this week.
■ The Soiree came off on Wednesday afternoon.
The general average of the Examination is excellent.
Oh “Joe”l how is them copper-toed pants—eh? Hal ha! ha!.
Rev. J. Kennedy, of Brooklyn, an old student—of ’66— is here.
Mr. John Conahan, of Chicago, was with us for a few days this week.- -■	‘	.	..
We are extremely happy to learn that Prof. Stace is to remain with us for at least one more Session. '
Several Commercial Students have been assured of obtaining their diplomas in June. Several, too, have been disappointed.
Our Director of Studies was kept very busy fora couple of days, and even nights, after the Examination.
Our fiddler will do most anything to oblige the boys when they are frenzied for a good old hop.
Several Juniors have lately risen in the scale of humanity and taken their places in the ranks of the Seniors. We hope they will be worthy members of our irreproachable Department.
The road leading from the College to the Novitiate is
in a-very poor condition. Tt needs some kind of a respect4-able path. Let us have good walking. -	'	k
We- have seen “frauds” and impostors of all sorts, but seldom have we seen the parallel of the stencil-plate cutter who tried to come it over the students on Monday; He’ caught a few, but only a few.	-
On last Tuesday evening the members of the St. Cecilia Phiiomathean Association met together in their usual place, and in the presence of a number of visitors presented Bro. Marcellinus, C. S. C., Prefect-in-chief of the Juniors, with a beautiful silver-headed cane as a mark of their esteem and affection. '
■ The singing of the Choir last Sunday, and on Monday, the Feast of the Purification, was remarked by every one to be excellent. They rendered the celebrated prize Mass of Stehle with considerable expression, and the “ Ave Maria ” of Arkadelt, which was sung as an Offertory piece, was especially fine. We understand the Choir is now preparing a much-admired Mass by Greith. Indeed their zealous efforts, to bring gour church music up to the standard deserves every commendation.
No doubt skating and sliding on the ice is a fine amusement, but we don’t want any more of it in ours since the other day. We ventured upon the ice, and no sooner had we got fairly out from the shore than a “whole pile” of Juniors gathered around us, and such yellingas they did keep up for about a quarter of an hour we had not heard since Jonas swallowed the whale. We soon made tracks for the shore, but did not reach it until we had several times' lost and regained our perpendicularity. We had got within one step of terra firma and commenced to congratulate ourselves on escaping with what we had on, when to our extreme mortification we heard some one compare us to a certain quadruped on ice! We will not repeat our reply; it was fearful.

that all look forward to next Commencement Day with a well-grounded hope of perfect success.
We give below the programme of the Entertainment. The “ Grand Aria ” from Mignon was given with fine effect; the highest note, E on third ledger line, was reached with perfect ease. The whole Vocal Class gave evidence of fine talent and excellent ^training. The instrumental music was quite up to the standard of excellence required at St. Mary’s from the First and Graduating Classes—and this implies a high compliment to the young ladies who took part in the programme.
