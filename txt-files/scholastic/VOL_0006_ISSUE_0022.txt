The Scautiful Valley of SSemsamcook.
To the Editor of The Scholastic : This valley is situated between the Bay of Fundy and the Golf of St. Lawrence. When it first breaks upon the view from the Northern extremity, it presents the aspect of a river once scooped out by the hand of some one of the genii, but now deprived of its dashing torrents, save a small stream that winds its serpentine course towards the Bay of Fundy. On each side •of this river spreads to the right and to the left a .considerable plain of marshy land, here and there, interrupted by a clump of bushes that the hand of industry has not yet rooted up.
As you advance, you perceive that it is entirely surrounded by a chain of hills which, open only to let the small river, on its southerly course, pass on to the clearer waters. The summits of these hills are magnificently studded with trees, and form a pleasing contrast with, the level and open valley below. Yet everywhere the’hand of man is evident: interspersed here and there in the forests may be seen openings that show to the observer that the hand of enterprise is borne by a strong and courageous arm. About two miles from the northern extremity of the valley, and situated upon a small eminence on the right side of the river, is the College of St. Joseph, which was founded by the C. S. C., about nine years ago, and which continues to flourish under their judicious direction. A little beyond is the parish church and presbytery, built of gray freestone, and exhibiting a majestic appearance when compared with the buildings which surround them. A little farther on, we meet the Academy of the Sacred Heart, erected about two years ago. Passing these buildings, nothing unusual presents itself until we arrive at the town of Dorchester, where the valley terminates. This town is situated on the left bank of the river, at. the southern extremity, and is connected by railway with Halifax, Shediae, and St. John. The entire valley is overlooked from the college, and, on the whole, exhibits a more beautiful panorama than scenes whicn are far more renowned.	A Resident.

Circulating Library Society
Mr. Editor: Our long silence might indicate to you that we are languishing; but if so, change your notion instantly. This Society is in the height of prosperity, as every person who has attended our regular meetings can testify. Our plan of action is to peruse our books silently and diligently, and leave the loud talking to be done by our able brethren, whose pride it is to sound in Sj ’ eloquent notes the vocal organ.
•At our last meeting, held on the 1st inst., an election of officers for the coming session took place, and resulted as ’ follows:	.
Director—Rev. A. Lemonnier.	•
President—J. D. McCormick.
Librarians—P. J. O’Connell, A. J. Mooney.
' Treasurer—M. M- Foote. ,	Secretary—T. J. Dundon.
We have had a handsome addition to our Library, since , our last, of sixty select volumes. The thanks of the So ciety are due to Rev. Father Lemonnier for his many ele-■ gant donations to our Library, including, the works of f Shakspeare.	.
We have at present upwards of four hundred volumes,— a neat selection—and an attractive tier of letters for the lovers of literature.

Rules for Life.—The following rules, from the papers of Dr. West, were, according to his memorandum, thrown, together as general waymarks in the journey of life:
Never to ridicule sacred things, or what others may esteem such, however absurd they may appear to be.
Never to show levity when the people are professedly engaged in worship.	‘
Never to resent a supposed injury. untill I know the views and motives of it. Nor on any account to retail- ■ ate.	-
Never to judge of a person’s character by personal appearance.
Always to take the part of an absent person who is censured in company, so far as truth and propriety will allow. .
Never to think the worse, of another on account of his differing in political or religious opinions.	.

Rev. Father Lohage, C.S.C., has been placed in charge of the St. Joseph Novitiate, and Rev. Father Letourneau has been appointed Director of the Manual Labor School.
The St. Cecilia Philomathean is decidedly the most energetic and liveliest Literary Society at Notre Dame. Their semi-weekly “ Standard ” is a paper full of excellent, articles.
New students are arriving every day, and the College is as full as ever. It is consoling to see the health of the inmates of Notre Dame so good, even during the severe winter which we are having.
Rev. Father Demers, C.S.C., has been appointed to take charge of the congregation of St. Vincent, near Fort Wayne, ®ice Rev. Father Fr^re, C.S.C., who will return to Notre Dame to attend to new duties.
A very extensive building is about to be erected on the northwest side of the College. It will be in the shape of a square, presenting a front of 680 feet when completed. It is intended as a residence for the Sisters and for all the various departments under their charge',—such as wash-rooms, clothes-rooms, kitchens, etc. The cellar, under the west wing, will be 240 feet long by 30 feet wide; the kitchen is to be 90 feet long by 60 feet wide, and fitted up in such a manner as to answer the wants of 1,000 persons. The wash-room will be perfect in its arrangements, and will likewise supply without difficulty the wants of a multitude.
The putting up of these buildings will necessarily interfere this’ year with the erection of the intended wing of the College.
Obituary.
Died, on the 28th nit., Brother Bernard Joseph, so long and favorably known to our readers as an eminently successful teacher and fervent religious; his unexpected death has filled us all with deep regret. Very Rev. Father General, in a circular announcing the death of this excellent religious, says :
** You win all be painfully surprised to hear of the death of our dear Brother Bernard Joseph. Since he returned Rom Ireland, with his seventeen postulants, he had enjoyed excellent health. When he left here on Tuesday evening,- the 21st inst, he seemed better than ever-But it appears he suffered from the'cold in the cars, between here and Chicago; there he contracted the beginning of a pleurisy which, in spite of the best medical aid, proved fatal on the following Tuesday night. During his sickness, first with the excellent family of J. Scanlon, Esq., and then with the Sisters of Charity, in St. Joseph’s Hos
pital, he received all the helps of our Holy Faith, and died a most edifying death, in the arms of his own dear Brother Joseph, who had been sent from here on Monday previous. His remains were buried here yesterday at two o’clock, p. ir.
In the loss of Brother Bernard Joseph the Congregation loses one of its most faithful and devoted members. None will feel more keenly than myself the sad and unexpected intelligence I now convey, with a special request to immediately offer in his behalf every suffrage secured to him by the Rules.
He was born in Ireland A. D. 1824; received the habit here in 1853, and made his profession in 1855, on the 15th of August. Requiescat in pace.

Play-Halls.—Nothing strange has happened in this quarter of late; the programme remains unchanged. However, we do not see the parallel bars in use as much as we expected; these will afford good exercise, even better than to going the lake “ to pulL” The stove ifi the play-hall has the fame of being a good feeder, and judging from the amount of wood stacked up by the door, it will not have to go hungry for some time, nor be in want of a lunch at any hour of the day. The firemen are attentive, and we hear no one complaining, Lining the play-hall on the inside has made it much more comfortable than before.
TH E SCHOLASTIC.
S’ly-CatchcB.
A Great Deal of Local.—Our local items are of necessity quite extended, owing to the season, and the changes that have taken place.
The Rising Sun.—Not unfrequently at this season of the year is our attention called to the glory of the rising sun; and especially was this' the case on Sunday last. It was truly a beautiful sight.	•
Field Sports.—It is thought that the new Department will tend much to revive the field sports, which during the last session seem to have suffered a relapse. We hope so. “Work while you work, and play while you play.”
House-War wing. — Some one has remarked that the Collegiate students should when settled in their study-hall give a house-warming. ■ But most of them look upon this as “ too thin,” and prefer leaving it to the boilers in the steamhouse.
The Societies are prosperous, and have begun the new session well; they have elected officers and are cultivating their various objects. The St. Edward’s, owing to the University Study-Hall, and the Graduates’ Dormitory, have been in rather “ unstable equilibrium,” having been obliged to move twice already, and do not yet find themselves settled. The Philodemics, however, have not been, disturbed by the changes and improvements thus far.
Race for the Play-Hall.—Not a little excitement is occasioned, on the breaking of ranks after breakfast, by the race for the Play-Hall, or rather for the stove. Some twenty or thirty of the students thus try their fleetness every morning through the snow. All start the moment the Brother claps his hands for the breaking of ranks; we have noticed no peculiar champion, but each morning seems to have its particular victor. This is healthy, and good exercise.
Examination Week.—This is always a week of anxiety, and occasions more talk than all the rest of the year put together. Everyone feels anxious to know what he will be asked, and how he will pass; the student knows that his knowledge is to be put to the test, and he often feels somewhat sftalcy; but when it is over he looks back upon it and comes to the conclusion that it was not such a fearful ordeal after all, and why should he have been scared— if scared he was. This still remains the topic of conversation, and some one says “ Look sharp for June.”
Circulating Library.—Not many days ago our attention was more particularly called to the books stored in the Circulating Library case, and though we admired the selection from the first, our admiration was much enhanced upon a further examination. ‘ The truth of the matter is, there is not a better selection of books to be found. We never saw anything equal to it.- all standard works. Our attention was thus especially attracted on seeing the books out of the case, having been removed in order to move the case into No. 3, where the Library is now located.
Tim Entertainment of which we spoke was postponed from Saturday to the following Tuesday. It was, as we anticipated, a success; each one did well, some even splendidly. The audience was well pleased, and every one enjoyed it very much. These entertainments are the more pleasing as. they are rare. Rare things are generally precious. We
would be glad if these entertainments could be more frequent-say monthly ; but the general objection which is urged is a want of time. Still, time used in this way can never be looked upon as lost; the truth is, it is most profitably employed—even more so than one might at first im-. agine.	-
The Thespians are “ up and doing,” and have already commenced to look out for the 22d. We understand they intend producing “ The Iron Chest,” a drama which is well worth listening to, and is well adapted to the Society’s ability. Though some of their best members have gone home, we do not despair of them; on the contrary, far otherwise; they are always equal to the occasion, and the Society is still far from being in a weak condition. We understand they have selected a play for St. Patrick’s Day also, and we hope they will be as successful as they were last year on these occasions. Why shouldn’t they?
Autograph books went the rounds as the session neared a close. Thus do students become attached to one another, and take this means of preserving in their own minds the remembrance of their fellows at college and of college days themselves. These will in years to come afford them many a pleasant hour, as will the reading of the Scholastic. Everyone in after years loves to look back upon the days when he was a student, and remember the good times spent at college. And these books will serve to revive college life before the mind’s eye, and the possessor often for the a moment will think himself back again within the hallowed walls of the old college.
Having felt somewhat inclined towards amusement the other morning, we wended our way to the Seniors’ playhall, and, on entering, the graceful movement of jovial dancers and the delightful strains of a mouth-organ attracted our attention. Being partial to the terpsichorean art, we soon mingled in with the merry throng, and after satiating our love for the sport, curiosity prompted us to see who it was that generously gave a part of his recreation to furnish music for our indulgence. It proved to be our genial friend, Edward Spitley. Many thanks to Eddy for his kindness and manifestation of good will. We feel certain that these “ thanks ” are reciprocated by all.
Changes.—Many changes for the better have been made within the past few weeks, and already eclipse Examination as a subject of conversation among the students. The Collegiate Study-Hall has been finished: its situation is opposite the class-rooms of Profs. Howard and Tong, the two rooms being converted into one, which has been well fitted up, even finer than anyone anticipated. Here are to be accommodated the students who have entered the University Course,—namely those of the four last years of the Classical and Scientific Courses. It is a want which has been making itself more apparent as the institution has advanced in years and prosperity. Not only is it a source of great convenience to those who are already sufficiently advanced, but a source of encouragement to others who are in the Preparatory Course. It has also been found advisable to make more dormitory room, as owing to the great number of students attending the University the dormitories have been too crowded; and the rooms known as the Prefects’ and Vocal Rooms have b^en thrown together for a dormitory for the students of the graduating year. The students are all well pleased, and especially those of the Collegiate Department, with the” kindness and solicitude which is thus manifested in their regard..

THE SCHOLASTIC
The Notes of Examination were announced in the respective study-halls at eight o’clock, a.m., on Sunday last. The notes were announced as being quite satisfactory, and indeed they were generally very good. The students of the Senior Department gave a hearty applause upon the announcement that Messrs. Charles Hodgson, Jas. L. Noonan, and H. N. Saylor were accepted in the Commercial Course, and were to receive their Diplomas at the Annual Commencement in June. Indeed they are worthy young gentlemen, and we take this occasion to extend to them our warm congratulations. The Rev. President of the University read the notes in the Seniors’ Hall, and observed that those who had studied well during the past session had, as a necessary consequence of their labor, passed a good examination, while, on the other hand, it was not too late for the others to commence to work well alsofive months yet remained, in which time a great deal may be accomplished if the student will but apply himself to earnest work. May all improve these golden hours. Shortly after the Rev. President had concluded his remarks, the Rev. Vice-President of the University came in and expressed his satisfaction, besides making known the promotions, etc. A general satisfaction is felt among the students regarding the Examination notes.
The Cold Snap.—Another cold snap has just passed, and indeed it was cold enough for us. We thought when the last one was over that a January thaw should be the next on the programme; but the clerk, it seems, does not always act as we expect him to. We think he has been rather severe this winter, and has given us more cold weather than we could naturally expect. The fact of the matter is, we have had the severest winter thus far that we have ever experienced at Notre Dame. February is flying, and still the winter seems to maintain its rigor. Anxious indeed are we to chronicle the return of the swallows and to behold the first blade of green grass that the Spring will send forth. Some mornings of the past few weeks were indeed beautiful,—the sun rising in the east, the cold frosty snow glistening in its light, the clearness of the sky and the serenity of the morning, all attract attention and tend to make us forget the keenness of the cold. The snow, “ the beautiful snow,” is all that greets our eyes as we sit at our window and look upon the monotonous scene; yet in our eyes it is not half so beautiful as it was when the earth first put it on; it has been worn too long, and like all old garments seems to decline in beauty as it advances in age. Yet when another Fall comes round we will hail it with the same delight as we did last autumn when it first fell.
Chit-Chat.—The changes about the college have occasioned considerable excitement, yet we notice nothing particularly “ off the track.” We consider that scrubbing the study-hall was not a misstep; that coal is not a bad thing to use occasionally in the steam-house; and we think the Ave Mabia deserves to be stereotyped. Nor can it be urged that the Minims were not justified in giving four or five stragglers a “face-washing” for intruding upon their premises, or because Brother Augustus locked his “ dorg ” in a room. Though it is true that we had recreation on Saturday last, recreation is a good thing occasionally, and especially so on the first day of the new session, but we cannot look upon this as causing the hopeless con
dition into which skating has fallen in this vicinity. The clock in the Seniors’ study-hall has caught the epizootic from the large one in the church-tower, yet this did not prevent the students from sleeping until half-past six during Examination week. The new boxes that have been made for the wash-rooms should not be omitted to be mentioned ; and the wish for milder weather is not the least among our desires. When the students of the Collegiate Course have removed from the Seniors’ study-hall the Commercial students will be greatly accommodated in having more room—the want of which is not unfrequently felt by them.
SAI^T MAST’S ACADBMT.
St. Maby’s Academy, February 4, 1873.
The Semi-annual Examination closed on the 31st ult. Classes were reorganized and regular duties commenced on th 3d inst.' The reports received from the different bureaus are very satisfactory; many pupils in each class were marked 100 in their studies; very few received less than 75. The notes of each pupil will be forwarded to her parents or guardian. The pupils had evinced great earnestness in preparing for the Examination, therefore all seem satisfied with the past and full of energy and hopeful ambition for the future.
On Friday evening the young ladies had a very pleasant dancing-party, which seemed to afford them a delightful relaxation after the exciting labors of the week.
The bright sun seems as if it will dissolve their hopes of the promised sleighride, but his rays are so cheering that there will be no disposition to murmur at the disappointment.	.
On the Feast of the Purification the pupils witnessed the ceremony of the profession of four novices: Sister Mary of the Holy Infancy, Sister Mary of the Purification, Sister Mary of the Presentation, Sister Mary of St. Eutro-pia.
The Honorable Mentions of this week are taken from the Examination reports. Instrumental Music and English Classes will be mentioned next week.

Two things indicate an obscure understanding—to be silent when we ought to converse, and to speak when we should be silent.

Advertise in The Scholastic.
We have concluded to take a limited number of choice advertisements this year, should our business friends conclude to patronize us in this department.
This arrangement, however, will not nterfbre with the reading matter, as we propose printing the advertisements on a separate sheet, to serve as a cover to the present Scholastic. This will be done as soon as a sufficient number of advertisements are secured.
