“IF I WERE A EING.”
A Drama in Four Acts.
Scene H.
Under the White Oak.—Time, midnight.—(Lights down).— ■	Forest Scene.
(Don Gonsalvo alone; enter Ruisco cautiously?) Ruisco. There is no risk, Gonsalvo. At this hour
The very stars are sleeping. See: the clouds	'
Draw a black curtain to shut out the light.
’Tis dark as Erebus. ’Tis just the time
’To make our plot secure. Look you around:
’Tis still enough for murder. Fear you not!
No living soul can find us. We are safe
From human eyes and ears.
Gonsalvo. You’re very sure?
Ruisco. Sure as a. man can be. That’s sure enough.
Gonsalvo. The pledge stands good, Ruisco. All is well.
Ruisco. Yes, on the same conditions.
Gonsalvo. . (Gruffly.) Give the scrip!—
Quick! None must know I met you. Come! make haste! Ruisco. Take it, my lord; and read it, if you please. Gonsalvo. (Heading slowly by the aid of a dark-lantern?)
“I, Ruisco, on my word of honor pledge
The Castle of St. Elmo and the lands
Of Sicily adjoining, with the forts
Of Palermo and Gaeta, to the crown
Of my lord king of Spain, if in return
His Minister, Gonsalvo—in event
Of Ferdinand the king’s assassination—
(Pauses, and looks at Ruisco significantly)
Shall recognize me as the lawful heir, And hail me King of Naples.” All is right. Here is my pledge.
(Gonsalvo hands a paper, which Ruisco reads in silence.) Ruisco. The work is done, hidalgo. .
Gonsalvo. When shall we storm St. Elmo ?
Ruisco. Any time.
Three days at farthest. Wednesday if you will.
Gonsalvo. Agreed!
Ruisco. ’Tis General Cesare in command;
He will straightway surrender. All is fair.
He knows my plan, and scruples nothing. : • Gonsalvo. (With a warning gesture.)
.	.	Hold!
My name must not be used. Adieu, my lord!
Ruisco. (Folding his arms and walking musingly.)
Matters are gliding smoothly. In one week
The task will be accomplished. ’Tis good luck
That so far, none have thwarted; but in fact .
Should I desire I could not now retreat.	. 1
My cousin’s eldest children, proud and fair—	I
Yes, they were wisely stolen. They are gone, And quite forgotten for these many years;	’
And yesterday the last one perished,—died By accident;- a prudent accident! (Chuckling) (Enter Genaro noiselessly, hidden by a tree.) Drowned in the Bay of Naples. No one now Stands in my way but Ferdinand himself, And he shall be disposed of,—for why not ?—	. 2
Since matters must go forward ? One bold step ' - > Will make me king. . Yes, I can trust my men:	. V
There’s Cesare at the head—and Stephano	.
With his brigands; and Banquo best of all,—	"
For one clear farthing he would sell his soul; . . r A very rare old scoundrel! ‘Good for him!
But I must call him quickly. ‘	"
(Blows a whistle, and Banquo soon enters.)	'
Ho, Banquo! (Presentspaper.)	. f
Here’s work for you: see that it is well done.	2
Take this dispatch yourself, with special care,	_
Straight to the Spanish Admiral. Now, mind: His picket boat you’ll find upon the Bay,	' _n
Close to the three white willows. Furthermore, ’
■	(Hands paper.)	'
This message to the General in command
At Santa Elmo, General Cesare. Hark,—	- ■'
In his own hands!	_	'	_
Banquo. (Obsequiously.)	'
My lord, I understand! *	'
Ruisco. The work must be done quickly. Do you hear F Banquo. .Yes, my lord; I shall be prompt and faithful. Ruisco. (Discovering Genaro.)	' ■
(Aside) Zounds! What if that boy has heard? I must know!	'
The youngster must be questioned. Zounds! what luck ! ‘
(Aloud) Boy! What are you here for ?
Genaro. Signor, in reply	.
I may request to know, if you will tell,	~
Whether a nobleman who in good faith	'	- -1
Appears a courtier is not out of place	• '
In this deserted spot at such an hour?

Since night was given to honest men to sleep. .
266	THE SCHOLASTIC.
Ruisco. Have you seen men with me? Speak out now, boy.
Genabo. I know not whom, even now, I might behold, Could I distinguish with a keener sense.
Ruisco. (Menacingly.)	-
Be not too sharp, young fellow. (Aside.) If I knew That he had heard our plot I’d kill him. Wait!
His comrades may be near. (Aloud.) Look out, young man,
About that tongue of yours.
; Genabo. (Proudly.) Spare your advice.
(Exit Ruisco R., looking menacingly at Genabo;—after a pause:)
I am a shepherd boy; Pm nothing more;
But I’ve a conscience, and were I a king It would be no more binding. lam sure There’s mischief in the wind. That wretched man Covets the throne of Naples. It was he Who made attempt to drown the little Prince, And now he plots the murder of the king.
Banquo is his abettor. Just the man To cringe for an assassin. But for me— Now is my time! Pll act the honest part. O Blessed Virgin Mary, help your child To execute your pleasure! •( Whistles for the shepherds, who enter.)	'
Cecato. (Rubbing his eyes, hair tumbled, etc.) Shepherd King,
I think you’re getting crazy. Funny time For you to call your courtiers. Never mind. (Scratches his head) I beg your pardon! I was sound asleep '
And wanted to stay dreaming. By the way, Who was that ruffian fellow whom we met ?
I surely thought he’d crush me.
Genabo. Silence, boys!
That man is a vile traitor. Do not speak Of what Pm going to tell you. Promise me. . (AU.) Yes, yes, Genaro.
Genabo. (In a suppressed, but clear and distinct'voice,) As I lay asleep
I thought you called me, Silvio. I awoke, And heard a husky voice, then I arose To find out who was talking. “ Who,” thought I, “ Can come at such a time for any good ?”
I crept behind that tree, and, what think you?— The man you met was crowing to himself Of killing king Ferdinand. Boys, keep still!	’
He named accomplices; Banquo was one!
(AU start, and look at one another in astonishment.) ■
Cecato. (Shaking his head.)
Banquo! Just like him! I am in for it If he can get a flogging. Come on, boys! (Rolls up his sleeves.) Where will we find him ?
Genabo. (Authoritatively.) Quiet, Cecato, Or you will thwart my plan. A wily plot, Involving Don Gonsalvo, has been laid;	.	'
And General Cesare, of the royal troops At Santa Elmo, was upon the list. ' But the conspirator called Banquo— Boys (points) He stood where Marco stands. I saw the wretch Accept his murderous errands. ’Tis our place To intercept and balk him.
Cecato. Whoop! hurrah!
We’ll be the end of Banquo. Come along!!
Genabo. Hush! Do not be so noisy. We must go Directly on to Naples, and denounce
The traitors to the king. Poor shepherd boys, — ’
God grant they may believe us!
Mabco. (Thoughtfully and slowly.)
That black scamp
Might kill us on the way.
Genabo. Who is a coward ?
All. We are not cowards! We are not afraid I
Cecato. We’ll seethe end of Banquo! His old whip Will rest So will we shepherds.	.	.
Genabo. Listen, boys:	.
We’ll start before ’tis sunrise. Don’t forget To keep most prudent counsel. Go to rest, But speak to no one of what has occurred. Strict secrecy!	■
All. Yes; we’ll hold our tongues. (Exeunt.)
Genabo. The powers of darkness prowl about the world Like starving tigers. Ah, poor Naples! sleep	.
In thy unconscious beauty! In a day, The regicide will blast tiiy glory. Woe Follows Prince Alberto. He likewise
Is tracked by the usurper. When ’tis known	.
Alberto was not drowned, that human fiend
Will not rest till he drains the Prince’s blood.
Poor Naples! and poor monarch! Would to Heaven . I were a noble lord, a prince or king, To overthrow these monstrous plots! O friend I Invisible guardian from the Court on high!	-
Help me to execute this act of justice.	'
0 were I but myself a king,—could I
Command huge armies, and have castles strong, I would see justice done. Then I would go -And rescue Naples from this wicked plot.
(Plaintive Music.) Oh, would I were a king!
A mighty king.
(He lies down and falls asleep, singing “ Jf I were a king!)
(Enter Banquo, bringing Cecato, in a very confidential way, who, looking unconcerned, innocent and stupid, allows himself to be dragged to the scene.) ’
Banquo. (Coaxingly.) ’	•
Cecato, now my lad, I have some sheep	’
Just purchased near St. Elmo—and, you see, To make the bargain good, this document
Must go straight to the Castle. They were bought By means of General Cesare. Now, you see,
I want that you should take this right to him.	■
Cecato. (Takes the messaged)	■	- '	.
Yes, sir; I’ll do my best. Nobody else
Shall touch this paper till I have a mind.	•
Banquo. (Patting him on the shoulder.)
That’s a fine fellow! That’s a charming lad!
Good journey to you; when you have come back I will reward you with a piece of gold. (Exit.) .(Cecato swaggers and gesticulates mockingly for some time.) . Cecato. What a big fool he is! Rogues think they’re smart;	,
But, fooling, sometimes they are fooled themselves.
How cunning you are, Banquo! Ha! ha! ha!
You amiable old porcupine! I wish	.	.
You could have seen yourself! you looked in truth -Like henbane playing rosebush. Ha! ha! ha!	- '
I’ll keep your.message safe. .Poor foolish man!

Will the lads be frightened at fair weather ? .
Pedro. No ! not they!	.

Lucio. They’ll do their work at Ischia; but how long Will Ferdinand be gone from Court ?
Pedro. Not long;	. ’
Just a few days to please his own caprice.
Lucio. The boys will bring rich booty. ’Tis the time To make our fortune. Pedro, for my part
I’d rather be a robber strong and brave

Shaksperian Beading.
Mr. Robert King favored the faculty and Students of the College with as splendid a treat as they have enjoyed this year. The programme of his Shaksperian reading included the second, fourth and fifth scenes of the First Act of Hamlet; the first, second and third scenes of the First Act of Othello, and also the famous “ Trial Scene ”; and a selection from Julius Caesar where Cassius is instigating Brutus to join the conspirators against the life of Casar.
Mr. King has been long and favorably known to the public; he has an excellent voice and splendid gesture; and on hearing him read we could not but wish to hear him on the boards with all the accessories of persons and scenery. His reading of Hamlet showed great study and appreciation of the character, but it was particularly in the part of Othello that we admired him. The day after, on being called upon, Mr. King delivered a brief aud stirring impromptu address to the students. Mr. King’s visit was a pleasure to all who saw and heard him, and we hope that he enjoyed his short stay at Notre Dame.
Public Debate.
The St. Edward’s Literaiy Association will give its second annual Seance on the evening of Tuesday, May the 6th, when the following subject of debate will be publicly discussed: Resd'ced, “That the State is Justifiable in making the Education of Youth Compulsory.” The speakers on the affirmative will be Messrs. J. K. Finley, T. J. Murphy and J. D. McCormick; on the negative, Messrs. C. J. Dodge, W. J. Clarke, and M. S. Foote.

Gentle zephyrs greet us frequently.
We welcome the beautiful month of May Extra-recreation on last Saturday afternoon. Work has commenced in the Botanical Garden. Architectural.—Brother Deter has lately shown us a splendid perspective view of the Goshen Court House, drawn from a photograph by himself. It has been hanging in the Students’ Office for the past few days.
A Hint.—It is a noteworthy fact that about this time op the year the buildings are cold even when it is quite comfortable outside. A little more steam would .be quite acceptable and prevent the use of overcoats indoors.
Plants.—The Collegiate Study-Hall has been considerably beautified by the presents of several plants, which decorate the windows and enliven the appearance of things. Brother Norbert takes pleasure in having things tasty.
“Too Thin.”—We notice the following lines in Shakespeare’s play of Hemy VIII:
----------“ But know I come not
To hear such flatterings now; and in my presence
They are too thin and. bare to hide offence.”
The Playground.—The old fence which ran from the corner of the Exhibition Hall to the Junior Playground has been removed, and the grounds thus formed have had two rows of thrifty trees planted in them. They extend parallel to and along near the new fence, of which we spoke in a former issue. The old fence, has been removed and is being used to inclose the Minims’ Playgrounds.
The Bishop’s Visit.—His Lordship the Bishop of Fort Wayne honored us with his presence on Friday evening of last week. The chime-bells rang forth a welcome and the big bell sounded its loud peals of joy. The Band came out and played in honor of our distinguished guest. Recreation was given on the afternoon of the following day, when of course bats, balls, swings, etc., all had a good time.
Letter from New Brunswick.
St. Joseph’s College, Memramcook, N. B., April 18th, 1873.
Mr. Editor: By some unaccountable oversight we have neglected sending to you accounts of the many excellent Exhibitions which have been given this past winter by the students of St. Joseph’s College.
There was no Exhibition here on the 22nd of February —but when the Province of New Brunswick shall have become one of the States of the Great Republic, we will then chronicle with pleasure the Exhibitions given at Mcmramcook on that day. Perhaps that may be at no very distant period of time.
A small Literary Exhibition was given about the first of March in honor of the return of the Very Rev. Father Lefebvre from Canada. At this Exhibition speeches were made by Messrs. Mclnerny, Meehan, Bourque, Bourgeois, Belleveau, and others; while Messrs. Walsh, Costigan, Connier, Bourgeois’, Belleveau, and others, entertained the assembly with well-delivered declamations. Music, well rendered by Messrs. Ringuette, Walsh, Bourque, Yorke, and others, agreeably varied the entertainment.
On St. Patrick’s Day High Mass was celebrated by Rev. L. Geoffrion, C. S. C., assisted by Rev. Messrs. Donahoe and St. Pierre as deacon and subdeacon. In the evening an excellent Entertainment was given by the students. Declamations were given by Messrs. Costigan, O’Flaherty, Meehan, Walsh, O’Regan, Mclnerny, Bourgeois, Connier, Belleveau, Bourque, and others. Speeches were delivered by Messrs. Bourgeois and McGill. Two English plays and one French play were well rendered.
On March 19th, St. Joseph’s Day, we were honored with a visit by the Rt. Rev. Dr. Sweeny, Bishop of St. John,
THE SCHOLASTIC.
269
The Bishop celebrated Pontifical Mass, assisted by Very Rev. Father Lefebvre, C. S. C., Rev L. Geoffrion, C. S. C., Very Rev. Father Connelly, V. G., Rev Father Murray, Rev. Father Lecours, C. S. C., and Rev. Father Hussier. At this Mass Revs. Chas. Donohoe and Cyrille St. Pierre were ordained priests, and Mr. C. Lemay, C.S.C., received Minor Orders. The College Choir sang with great taste Lambillotte’s Paschal Mass.
In the evening an Exhibition was given by the students, at which speeches were made by Messrs. Costigan, Bourgeois, Bourque, and others. The plays were “The Harvest Storm,” “Do you know me now ? ” and “ The Departure for California;” the last being in French. The characters in the first-named play were taken by Messrs. Mclnerny, O’Neil, O’Regan, Costigan, O’Flaherty, Hart, Walsh, McGoldrick and Yorke. The second was played by Messrs. Walsh, O’Flaherty, Sharkey and Murray. The last was enacted by Messrs. Bourque, Ringuette, Bourgeois,Connier, Belleveau, Lemay and others. Plenty of excellent music was given by Messrs. Ringuette, Walsh, Bourque, Belleveau, Connier, Bourgeois and others.	-
We are now having something in the way of a rest in Exhibitions, although the small boys will exhibit their ability in a few weeks.

Laboratory Lecture.—On Tuesday afternoon, at the regular class hour, Rev. J. C. Carrier, C. S. C., delivered before his Class of Chemisty and Physics a Lecture upon “The General Scope of Chemistry? The lecture was'very interesting, and in fact was in keeping with those already delivered by the Rev. lecturer.
The Quaa Geld
W. J. Quan, Esq., of Chicago, will always be regarded by the University of Notre Dame as a munificent patron of arts and sciences. A grand gold medal has been endowed by him to be awarded by the Faculty, at each Annual Commencement, to the most deserving student in the bran’ch ' that the Faculty will select. As it is the first endowed medal, we suppose that it will be the reward of the most deserving in the Classical Course. Mr. Quan cannot have his name connected with anything nobler than the promotion of education, and in this regard his name will be cherished and honored by both the Faculty and the students of Notre Dame.
Authority the Support of Society.
Locke in his Treatise on Civil Government bases society on the principle of property and individual interest. How • ever strange this foundation is in itself, we are of the opinion that unassisted it would be far from capable of sustaining the grand superstructure which has been raised upon it; ' and although the notion of a prop naturally suggests the idea of ruin and decay, yet we are forced to admit that society without a support other than that on which it is based would soon become a discordant and corrupt mass.
Nor is it in modern times, when the grand fabric of society has attained such a towering height, that this support first became necessary.
Neither does it become less essential as the edifice ap
proaches perfection. This support, which is nothing more nor less than authority, was as necessary to society in its earliest stages as it is at the present time; and it is as important at the present time, and will continue to be, at least so long as human nature remains unchanged, as the very principle on which society is based.
Blackstone remarks that there is nothing which so generally strikes the imagination and engages the affection of mankind as the rights of property. As the chief end and desire of society is to ensure the enjoyment of these rights, we might at first suppose that the principle of property and individual interest would be sufficient to secure its harmonious existence. But unfortunately for the peace of the world it does not contain enough of property to satisfy the avarice of all its inhabitants. Nay, so powerfully does the right of property engage the affections of mankind, that it may well be doubted whether the possession of the whole earth would be sufficient to satiate the desire of a single individual.
This, in connection with the fact that each member regards his interests as paramount to those of all others, and that many if unrestrained would substitute might for right, is sufficient evidence that society not sustained by authority must soon fall to ruin. It would indeed be a grand triumph for man could society be brought to that utopian state in which fines, penalties and prohibitions would be things superfluous.
But as it would be necessary to accomplish a revolution in human nature in order to attain that ideal degree of perfection, it were better for those who interest themselves in the amelioration of society to endeavor to strengthen that support so essential to its existence, and which unfortunately appeal s daily to grow weaker.
If while authority still holds such a powerful sway over society there can be found persons of sufficient hardihood to make open attempts on those vital principles on which society is based, what may we not expect if that sway be diminished? Ifman, with the gallows staring him in theface, will deliberately destroy that which it is the especial province of society to secure, knowing that the penalty attached to that crime is the greatest which it is in the power of man to inflict, will he not grow more desperate in his attacks in the same proportion that the penalty attached to his crime grows less 2 If the objects of society cannot be fully attained when the punishment is proportional to the offence, is it rational to suppose that the case will be bettered when the penalty is diminished, the opportunities and temptations to commit crime remaining the same?
Shakespeare says “you take my house when you do take the prop that sustains my house”: in like manner you take away authority when you take away that which gives it sanction—namely, the punishment which it is in its power to inflict. Although no one that we ever heard of has proposed to dispense entirely with punishment, yet there certainly exists at the present time a tendency to diminish it; and it was this fact that led us to say that authority, the support of society, is daily growing weaker. The notion at present prevailing that imprisonment is as severe a punishment as death is, we'venture to say, a spurious one. Life under any circumstances, especially to those who have no regard for honor, is preferable to death. The parting between the body and the soul is. indeed a bitter one, and he that wishes to renders service to society should rather incline to exaggerate than disparage the terrors of execution: for any act which tends to detract
270
SCHOLASTIC.
•from the force of authority, detracts just so much from the security of society.
To suppose that society does, ever did, or ever can •prosper without the support of vigorous authority, is to suppose an impossibility. Authority was to society in its infancy what the albumen of tbe seed is to the germinating plant—namely, that which sustains it while it is endeavoring to take root.
To society in its present state, authority is what the trunk is to the oak of the forest—namely, that by which it is supported in its elevated position, where alone its members may perform their respective functions, on the proper execution of which depends the welfare of the whole. Remove authority from society, and, like the mighty oak when its trunk is riven, it will fall prostrate and soon resolve itself into a mass of corruption.
Base-Ball.
We are much perplexed how to give you a full account of the doings in base balldom without trespassing too much on the columns of The .Scholastic. The fact is we are two weeks behind time. There is the Minim game with the Collegiale'Rattlers, and then there is the Young America game with the University Rattlers —both of wh<ch deserve an extended report, but all we can do is simply to notice the fact that they are all rattlers.
Tbe contest between the Juanitas and Collegiatcs will have been settled before this appears; and if we may anticipate from the games already played, tbe latter will be the victors. But a word upon the games already over. We have of course ftmished scores to The Scholastic,— but in so doing did not expicss any opinion beyond the bare fact that the games were played, and we feel that it would be unjust for us not to express the thauks and obligations that the Clubs feel towards those who have filled the important and disagreeable position of umpire so well. Mr. L. Hibben, of tbe Excelsior B. B. C., performed the duties of this position in the first game in a manner that redounds much to h’s credit both as a lover of fair-play and an experienced umpire. The second game was umpired by Mr. Joseph Roberts, who has earned a well-deserved reputation at Notre Dame both as an umpire and a very efficient player. The truth is, we have not heard a single complaint against our umpires thus far. This second game of which we speak, and of which we append a score, was played on the Junior grounds. It was the second game for the best record, and took place on Saturday, April 2Gtb. The game was interrupted at the end of the fifth innings by rain.

When Spring unrolls her garb of green, And clothes each hill and valley fair ;
I think of thee, my own loved isle! Where erst I wandered free from care.
And when the warblers’ sweetest notes Salute my ever-listening ear, My mind reverts to Erin’s groves, Where linnets troll their songs so clear.
Wlien sleep enchains my weary eye, How fast I cross the roaring sea, And on Benraven’s summits hoar, Behold the Sunburst floating free.
Then Tara’s lordly towers arise, Its halls once more with music ring, While on a throne of sparkling sheen Sits Erin’s tried and chosen king.
- But hark 1 a noise 1 I wake to find The towers and the monarch gone, Then, kneel I down and say with tears, “ Thy will, 0 Lord, not mine be done I” Celt.

SAIHT MAST’S ACADEMY.
St. Mary’s Academy, April 30,1873.
Several benefactors, patrons and friends of St. Mary’s have visited the Academy during the present month; among them were Hon. P. B. Ewing and wife, of Lancaster, Ohio; ' Mrs. M. M. Phelan, of the same city; Mrs. Major Walker, of Helena, Montana Territory; Mrs. Philip Carlin, Mrs. W. J. Quan, and Miss Powers, of Chicago; Mrs. E. Snowdon, of Louisville, Kentucky, and Mr. and Mrs Dahler, of Salt Lake City. The Community and the “Children of Mary” assisted this morning at the installation of St. Joseph as the Custodian of St. Mary’s, and special Patron of the Chapel which is to be erected on the spot where the Statue of St. Joseph now stands. The ceremony of blessing and placing the statue in the conspicuous place it now occupies was performed by Very Rev. Father General.
The pupils are now so earnestly occupied with their preparation for the Examination that time seems to fly with lightning speed, and the so much desired vacation appears almost too near at hand. Never was the Academy in a ' more flourishing condition as regards the number, intelligence and amiability of its pupils. The rapid development of the Institution is a source of great satisfaction to all interested ;. and that all includes a great number of friends and patrons in every section of the United States.
