[To the Editor of The Scholastic.]
Sir,—We were agreeably surprised on the 23d inst. by being informed that a Seance would be given by the smaller boys, that evening. This news was the more pleas-।	ing as we had not for some time had the pleasure' of wit-
I	nessing the students display their dramatic abilities. The
Seance was, as usual, held in the “ Recreation Hall,” which affords ample room for spectators, with whom, on this occasion, it was pretty well filled. '
The entertainment was opened by the College Band i playing a few popular airs, in their usual good style. The ‘‘Qpening Address” in French, was delivered by J. Sandors, of Montreal. Messrs. McFadden and McPhelim danced a “ Comic Polka,” Master C. A. Yorke playing the accompaniment—and, judging from the applause which followed, it was well received. Alister L. L iforest sang and played a song in English and French ,• he succeeded very well. The French play “La Giroflee” was well rendered by Messrs. Boidreau, Bourgeois, Cormier, Sanders and others. “ Fortune’s Frolic,” of which the parts were taken by Messrs. McPhelim, McFadden, Yorke, Maher, and f thers, was also well acted. Several piano solos were played during the evening by Messrs. Yorke, Ringuette, ' Levasseur, and Bourque, and added much to the enjoyment _cf the Entertainment.
The amusing farce “ Jack of All Trades,” by Alessrs.-McFadden, McPhelim, Yorke, Tucker and others, was, to use “Air. Briefwit’s ” favorite expression, “good.” AlcPhe-l:m, especially, took his part very well. “Les Saisons,” a French play, performed by Alessrs. Arsenault, Bourgeois Laforest, Belliveau, and others, received its merited applause.
' Alaster E. AfcPhelim delivered a short closing address. ’ The Band then played a few airs, concluding with the national anthem. Rev. F. Geoffrion then arose and offered a few very appropriate remarks in French and English, in i which he thanked the actors, on behalf of the audience, for the amusement they by their performances had afforded them throughout the evening, and, in conclus'o.i, proclaimed the following day a “conge" which announcement was hailed with delight on all sides.a The guests then dispersed, all satisfied with the evening’s entertainment, and looking forward with pleasure to the time when they'will spend another such evening in the presence of the students
- of the College.	O’N.
A lazy boy makes a lazy man, just as a crooked sapling makes a crooked tree.. Those who make our great and useful men were trained in their boyhood to be industrious.
•	“Slips goes Over.”
It seems to me but yesterday since I mingled among the throng of happy boys, and joined in their merry games. As my mind wanders back to those happy moments, that are now gone forever, I feel like exclaiming, in the words of the poet: “0 youth, return! Give me back my childhood hours!” Of the many games that I have taken part in, there was one that was always my favorite—the game of marbles. I remember well the many warm discussions I have had with my fellow-playmates concerning the fairness of the game. There was one word which usually brought on a debate, the word “ slips.” I cannot say whether the boys at this date use the word or not; but some fifteeen years ago it was well known among the boys- of the village of AI. C. It was used in the following sense. If a boy tired at a marble, and missed his aim, he would in most cases call out “ slips,” meaning that the marble slipped from his fingers and that he was entitled to another shot. This generally brought on a warm discus^ sion; but the boy that missed his aim would contend that “ slips went over.”
Alany, I am aware, used that as a plea when they missed ‘ their mark, which, of course, was not fair. I have, often thought while listening to lectures on elocution, that if those noted elocutionists were to visit the playground, they would there witness true elocution. When boys get warm in their discussions, all the powers of elocution are brought into requisition: enunciation, emphasis, tone, earnestness, expression, action, etc. I said I did not know whether the word “ slips ” is used by the boys of the present day, but I am well aware it is used by the men. They may not use the little monosyllable itself, but they use words to that effect. It would seem that some never forget the word; and, as in their youth, when failing in their first attempt they demand a second chance, be it ever so unjust, and so they continue to make unjust demands, until they are summoned before that One who cannot deceive or be deceived.
The crime of murder has got to be an everyday occurrence ; the reader of the public press reads an account of one man’s taking the life of his fellow-being with as little concern as though he was reading the market price of goods. And why has the. crime of murder become so prevalent ? In my opinion, because the perpetrator of the crime is allowed to go unpunished. As soon as he commits • the crime, he or some of his friends is sure to act like the boy in the game of marbles, who calls out “slips’’every time he misses his mark. They call out “insanity;” and., what is the result? In most- cases he is acquitted under,-that plea.
It sometimes happens also, in composition classes, when., boys fail to bring their Essays on the day appointed, and when they see they are to get a low mark, that they ma^e excuses like the following: “ Professor, I understood that
306
THE SCHOLASTIC.
Thursday was the day appointed for compositions.” Or if Thursday is the day appointed, “Professor, I understood that Saturday was the day appointed for compositions.” When I hear a student make such an excuse on composition day, it reminds me of the ungrammatical phrase of my youth, “ Slips goes over.” I will conclude by giving the following advice to the members of our Class:
“ If wealth thou art wooing, or title and fame,
There is that in the doing brings honor or shame, Be noble as men, and whatever betide,
Keep truth your companion and honor your guide.”
B. L.
The Championship Hypothesis. .
Various theories are afloat among Base-ballologians as to the terms on which the championship question was settled. Some, whose erudition and the labor spent in acquiring it have interfered with their baseball practice to a lamentable degree, so much so indeed that those who last year enrolled their names among the champions, this year find themselves without a leg—baseballically speaking—to stand upon, some, as we were about to observe, and their motive is transparent, boldly promulgate the dogma that championship no longer exists as an institution per se—that it is not even an ens secundum quid; nay, so far from allowing it a substantial existence are they, that they deny that it is even a mode—although quite d la mode among the same gentlemen themselves on last Exhibition day.
As for ourselves, we neither meddle with dogmatism nor medal with baseballism, but as,everybody must have some opinion on the subject, we incline to the more reasonable and popular hypothesis, that the championship, so far from being abolished, is attached to the best record of the season. In view of which,- we publish the Excelsior’s record, as furnished by their zealous director, from which the public cannot help drawing their own conclusion. We think that, metaphysics aside, our Second Floor friends have met a physic sufficient to enable them to pass a thorough Examination. All they want now is a tonic, but even that will scarcely enable them to cope with those who follow the “banner with the strange device.”

Danger of Beading Bad. Newspapers.
A Reverend friend writes us from Amsterdam, Holland: “Dear Mr. McMaster:—Anobleman, Baron S. (Ishall conceal his name out of respect for bis relatives, who are exemplary Catholics), resided in tbe Dutch province of Limburg, a few miles from tbe city of Ruremond. This man had always been a practical Catholic, and a friend of the surrounding clergy; but by reading a bad newspaper, (L'Independance Btlge,)&nd not reading any Catholic paper, he lost his faith, and became furious against the dogma of Papal Infallibility, against tbe Vatican Council, etc., and also against the pretended riches of tbe clergy, against tbe Jesuits, Redemptorists, and other Religious Orders.
“ He wrote and published in French a wicked pamphlet full of calumnies against the Church, Priests and Religious Orders. Mgr. Paredis, Bishop of Ruremond, wrote two letters to the unhappy Baron, and so did two Professors of Theology of the Diocese of Ruremond, beseeching him to publish a retraction of his errors, to repair the scandal he had given, and to make his peace with God. But all in vain. Then the Bishop allowed a priest to publish a pamphlet and to refute the errors of this poor apostate. Then the miserable Baron got irritated, and wrote to an infidel printer of Ruremond to publish, moreover, a Dutch translation of his diabolical pamphlet.
“But here God interfered! God had admonished this poor sinner by the voice of his Bishop. His errors had been refuted; but he, instead of retracting his errors and heresies, became worse, and intended to spread them also among his Dutch countrymen. He wrote then (as has been said above) to an infidel printer to publish a Dutch translation of his wicked pamphlet. This letter (to the printer) he sent by the morning post. But this was his last sin on earth, which filled the measure of bis iniquities! This Baron was President of an Agricultural Society. On that very day, when he had written to the primer, he presided over an agricultural meeting. One of the gentlemen having spoken, the President rose to add his remarks. But as soon as he had risen from his seat, he said in a low voice,11 My heart is pierced through" . . . and he dropped on the floor. They carried him out of the building, but the color of death had already covered his face. The parish priest came, and gave him conditional absolution. Some say he expired after the absolution, but others say that he was dead when the priest arrived. Who knows? But even if he was still living, would this absolution have saved him? Had he any contrition? This poor sinner was aged seventy-two years. He was buried in his vault on his own property.
“ The daughter of this unhappy man is married to Count D’A, in Belgium. This Count is a fervent Catholic, and bought and destroyed all the copies he could find of the

■wicked pamphlet of his father-in-law; but the unhappy old sinner -had it reprinted. JUors peccalorum pessima.—(Ps. xxxiii, 22).”
We would add only one remark. He that reads all ' kinds of books and papers indiscriminately, meets everywhere specious objections, which though shallow, he is not prepared to answer by a previous'study. He dommite a sin of pride by relying on his virtues or ability. God abandons him, and he perishes in the danger which he loved.—W. K Freeman'* Journal.
. Embellishments.
We live in a world full of the products of thought, study and ingenuity, but are often ourselves so heedless as not to note the fact. Not alone in those useful articles which are acceded to be necessary, and consequently everywhere to be found, do we observe the evidences of skill and invention, but likewise in those considered as strictly orna mental. Our personal adornments, the furniture of our dwellings, the embellishments of our grounds, and the construction of our public buildings, attest to this.
That ornamentation is so extensively employed, is a proof that it is in a certain sense far from useless. Nature itself, even, appears to suggest the utility of embellishments. She adorns the arch of the eastern sky at sunrise with her most appropriate and cheerful drapery of rose-color and gold. She hangs the purple curtains of the evening twilight, and sets therein her unique gems, the everlasting stars. She impearls the very air with peerless jewels when the April shqwers fall. She waves her sceptre of golden light over the heavens, and on the threatening storm-cloud paints the 1 matchless rainbow, the proof of God’s mercy to man. On the billow she carves the graceful foam-wreaths, and she mirrors the beauty of heaven in its waters. On the stately trees she suspends the greatest profusion of lovely flow ers, each one a faithful, earnest prophet of the ripe and delicious fruit soon to take its place, while she spreads the earth with a carpet of velvet grasses and beautiful blossoms.
We think history will bear us out in the assertion that the value set by a nation upon those arts designated as ornamental, is in proportion to the nobility and refinement of that nation; yet we believe the same authority will sustain us when we declare that the more truly intellectual a people become, the less care do they bestow upon adornments of the. person, and the more upon grounds, edifices, etc. The man of mind is satisfied with being simply and elegantly dressed. It is the fop who loves fashion, and display of his fine clothes; but it is the scholar, the artist, even the devout man, who delights in fine painting, statuary, architecture, landscape gardening, and the like.
When we visit galleries of art, or observe pictures copied from the old masters, we can never properly enjoy them if we fail to reflect upon the conceptions in the minds of the various artists which caused them to produce their noble works.
We are not very wise in artistic lore, but have heard that Leonardo da Vinci was for many months absorbed in study, trembling in awe and reverence over his subject, before he dare make the first attempt at the representation of our Divine Redeemer, in his world-renowned picture of the Institution of the Blessed Sacrament. Who can estimate the good effected by this single picture? ’
We grow like our surroundings. If we behold objects which remind us of heroic virtue, our weak resolutions imbibe vigor, and our poor hearts take courage. Is there no utility in this? Could we, enterprising children of the New World, who so delight to embellish our pretty persons (alas, often at the expense of interior adornment!) once realize the high esteem set by the grand-souled inhabitants of Europe, previous to the present cold and matter-of-fact age, upon symbolical ornamentation, we might become startled at our own stupidity, smart as we are. We might learn to see with their eyes, and value according to their correct standard. Happy for us should we do so!
Objects calculated to elevate our thoughts impart strength and purity to the. mind. Good air and food impart vigor and health to the body; and because the mechanical arts contribute to the comfort of the physical, we call them the useful arts. Are those fine arts which exalt and ennoble the mind of man less useful ? We believe not, and must insist that they serve even a more important purpose than their more obtrusive rival arts, because they contribute to the power of the better part of our being, and in this light shall we esteem them in future.

A professor of Cornell University recently published a number of hints as to “ What to do in case of accident.” One of these was as follows: “ If you choke, get down on all-fours and cough.” One of our neighbors—Woodward-read this, and determined to remember it. Day before yesterday he was eating his dinner alone, and he choked upon a piece of beef. Instantly he got upon all-fours and began to cough. Just then Mrs. Woodward came in, and the impression made upon her by Woodward^ extraordinary attitude and his barking was that he had suddenly been attacked with hydrophobia. So she first seized the pitcher of water and took it from the room. Then she sent one of the girls up stairs for the mattress, which was thrown over Woodward, while Mrs. Woodward and the family sat on it and held him down. The madder he got, the more alarmed was Mrs. Woodward; and the more he swore and foamed at the mouth, the more she insisted upon the hired girl giving an extra turn to the clothes-line around his leg and tying him to the stove. Then the doctor came and pulled Woodward’s arm from under the mattress and bled him, and put fly-blisters on his feet, and promised to come around in the evening and shave his head, in order to cup his scalp, so as to relieve his brain. When the doctor called that night, Woodward had a prizefight with him in the parlor; and after sending the medical man to the bath-room to wash the blood from his nose and cool his eye, Woodward went out to hunt for the Cornell Professor. There will be pain and anguish in that institution of learning when Woodward arrives. He means war to the knife.—Max Adder.
The heart of a deacon who officiated with the contrib-bution box at a recent meeting of foreign missions in Boston, was gladdened by observing among its contents a neatly-rolled package. On hastily investigating, his former belief in the depravity of human nature was changed to a certainty by discovering one dollar and a cent, and upon the paper the following:
“The cent is for the heathen, and the dollar is to get it to them.” .

Hon. Judge Ewing, of Lancaster, Ohio, was at Notre Dame last week.
The Daily Tribune is an enterprise worthy of the, thriving little city of South Bend.
Several talented musicians from Chicago will attend the Commencement Exercises.
The Jubilee on the 5th and 6th in Chicago was a success. From 50,000 to 75,000 visitors were in the city.
We had last week the very pleasant visit of George J. Gross, Esq., of Philadelphia. We regret he did not stay longer with us.
Prof. Schnurrer presented the University with a magnificent large folio volume illustrated with scenes in Ethiopia by.Bernatz.
Several meetings of the resident Alumni of Notre Dame University were held this week, preparatory to the grand meeting at the Commencement.
Hon. Claude Riopelle bets that he will be here bn Commencement Day. He is always welcome. We hope that Arthur and George will accompany him.	‘
From a letter dated off the coast of Ireland, May 19th, we learn that Very Reverend Father Sorin and party had very rough weather on their passage, and that all suffered from sea-sickness except Father Sorin himself. '
Tm?. Steamer on which Very Rev. Father General went to Europe arrived safely. We hope that he is now enjoying the hospitality of Very Rev. Father Cbampcau, at Neuilly, Paris. Very Rev. Father General will return to Notre Dame in August.	,, .
A large number of visitors is expected from Chicago and other cities at the Annual Commencemeut. Rev. E. B. Kilroy, Prof. P. Broder and General W. Lynch are coming; and several old graduates have already written that they will be present. .	..
The Minims’ Penmanship specimens showed a great proficiency in some, and a fair improvement in all. We hope that the .Minims will soon be able to compete with the Juniors in.the art of writing. The best specimens were those of C. Faxon, H. Faxon, A. Weatherbee,! and F. Ewing.	’' "
The First Honors will not be limited, as reported, to a certain fixed number, but will be awarded as usual to the students deserving them, whose claims to them will be very strictly examined.	'	,
The awarding of premiums to the students of the Freshman, Sophomore, Junior and Senior Classes of .the Classi-, cal and Scientific Departments, has been given up. \Qne„ grand Gold Prize will be “awarded in 'each Class, to the.
best student whose written composition and oral examin-' ation will be judged worthy of the prize.	-
The Senior Medal of the Classical Course is the Quan Medal of $30.00. The Junior Medal, given by the University, is a medal of $25.00. The Sophomore Medal, given also by the University, is a medal of $20,00. The Freshman Medal, likewise a present from the University, is a $15.00 medal.
The Medals of the Scientific Course are all given by the University, and range as follows: Senior. $25.00; Junior, $20.00; Sophomore, $15.00; Freshman, $10.00.	,
It may be asked why premiums are not given, as usual, in all the various branches of the two Collegiate Courses, The main reason'is that it is supposed the young men who belong to the Collegiate Courses regard it a sufficient reward to belong to their respective Classes, and their promotion from one Class to another is also a sufficient proof of their progress.
The first Class of the Commercial Course, being com-.posed mostly (we hope) of graduates, no premium shall be awarded in this Class. Their Diplomas are the best premiums the.v can desire. Nevertheless, a grand gold Medal will be awarded to the best competition.
In the Preparatory Department the. premiums will be awarded as usnal—with this difference from other years, however, that only one book will be given to each person entitled to a premium. On the inside page of the book will be recorded the number of premiums or acces.»its obtained by the recipient. Of course the value of the book will vary according to the number of the' premiums. iVe hope our little friends will not grieve at this. We know that the.mature student will prefer this much shnplek and more becoming way of rewarding his merits. In this case the book given is a record as well as a reward.

Scientific Association.
Editor Scholastic:—It would seem, of late, that it has become a little out of fashion for the Various Societies t<? give to the readers of The Scholastic any account of their proceedings and exercises, and hence we feel a little hesitancy in making ourselves known to the public. However, since_we have remained so far during the year in perfectsilence, we shall beg leave to intrude upon your columns to the extent of a statement that we are organized and in a flourishing condition, and have been so for some time past. The Scientific Association, as you know, although virtually organized, does not commence to hold regular meetings or begin its active work until the Second Session. At a recent meeting, the Association had the pleasure of listening to a lecture by their Rev. President, Father Carrier, upon the “ Second Day’s Work of Creation.” Any compliment that we would pay to the Rev. lecturer would be superfluous. His name is a sufficient guarantee for the excellence of his lecture. 'For the benefit of those whom it may interest, we give the list of officers elected at our first regular meeting:
. President—Rev. J. C._Carrier, C. S. C.
Vice President—John A. Zahm, C. S. C.
Recording Secretary—E. B, Gambee.

Fly-Catches.
Straw hats are in style.
The Fishing in the lakes is excellent.
The Minims fish extensively, of course. Base-ball has sunk into oblivion again. The oaks have at last put on their livery. The Thespians have commenced rehearsing.
• The Infirmary is lonely these tim.s; so few sick. We expect soon to see the roof on the New Church. Everyone wants to know if we are to have no Spring? Birth days and other excuses are anxiously sought for. The Minims-don’t like these extra-recreation days at all. Examination passed over very quietly, and we hear everyone calling it a very fair Examination.
Fruit.—It is thought that there will be plenty of fruit hereabouts this Fall. Students appreciate the orchard.
“ Slippery” is a term applied to the pier at the boathouse; experience has taught the use of this expression.
The Ball-Field, as usual, when base-ball has died out, is itself dead, and with it seems to die the life of the yard ; still, we do not chide; it is too warm for base-ball.
The garden fence has been painted white, and a row of cedars has been planted about the garden, which will, in a few years, if properly attended to, make a most beautiful fence.
The Students spend their recreation days either by taking long walks in the country or fishing. Quoiting was in vogue sometime since, but we have not seen much of it of late.
Scenes.—Owing to the want of room behind the stage for all the scenery, a place for the extra scenes has been made in the play-hall. The scenes can be let down from the stage.
We think the Boat Club must be rejoiced over something, for we have noticed their flag at full mast for some
days past. They ushered in the month of June by unfurling the “Stars and Stripes.”
The Ball-Alley is now the resort, after supper especially, when there is always a goodly amount of strength expended in seeing who can get on the alley first. We cannot but encourage this; it is good exercise.
Laboratory.—Another of those excellent lectures on “The Scope of Chemistiy” was delivered by Rev. J. C. Carrier, C. S. C., before the Class of Chemistry and Physics, during one of the recitation hours of last week.
Vacation will commence soon enough, and we should not take vacation now to think about it. A time for everything: work now, and when vacation does come, be prepared to ei joy it.
The Photographing Car. — Mr. Bonney, of South Bend, who has for so long a time done the photographing at the College as to be known by all the old students, has made grander preparations this year than usual. On Saturday last we were passing by the front of the College, when, turning our eyes down the main avenue, we Saw something red, which appeared to be a large box, drawn by two yoke of cattle. We watched it until it approached, and behold! it was the long-expected photographing-car. It is about thirty feet in length, and' is large enough to contain a Class of ordinary size. The car is situated between the Exhibition Hall and the garden. Mr.-Bonney’s presence always makes us feel that the year is neatly over; still we can hardly realize it.

| A Boston man tells the following newsboy story: Coupon, ‘.he corpulent banker, was standing on State street one hot day in August, “ wiping the servile drops from his brow,” when a ragged but sharp-eyed boy accosted him with: “ Please, sir, tell me the time ?” Coupon lugged out his watch, and looking benignantly down at his interlocutor, responded, “ Just two o’clock.” “ All right, old buffer,” said the gamin, gathering his legs together for a run, “you can sell out for soap-grease at three o’clock.” The insulted man of money raised his cane, and making a frantic rush at his tormentor, nearly fell over a friend that was coming up the street. Hello, Coupon, what’s the matter ? ” said the other. “ Matter 1 ” said. Coupon, puffing with heat and auger, “ why, one of those newsboys asked me the time, and when I told him two o’clock the impudent young scoundrel said I might sellout for soap-grease at three.” “Don’t be in a hurry,” was the malicious response; “it’s only five minutes after two. You’ve got fifty-five minutes to do it in.” .

SAINT MARY’S ACADEMY.
St. Mary’s Academy, June 4,1873.
The closing ceremonies of the Month of May were simply beautiful. The Academy and grounds were illuminated. The pupils walked in procession around the grounds, bearing lighted tapers and singing appropriate canticles. It was truly a picturesque scene, worthy of the occasion. As a full description of these beautiful ceremonies will be given elsewhere it is not necessary to go into the details.
Examination is now at hand, and all look forward with interest to the closing Exercises, which will take place on Thursday, the 26th inst., at 11 a. m. ’Each pupil is expected to remain till that day. Any pupil absenting herself, will not be named for premiums nor appear in the Roll of Honor. '

Genius.
Hundreds have attempted the definition of genius. When Sir Isaac Newton was asked for it, he replied: “Patience and work.” This answer was eminently characteristic; and whether correct or not, it is pregnant with meaning, and affords large food for thought. Sir Isaac would spend whole months in the examination of a single numerical relation, or the bearings of an angle of incidence, and if he was not then perfectly satisfied, over months were consumed in the same studies. Then when he had grasped fact after fact in an iron hand, and on them built up his sublime theory of the physical universe, it is no wonder that, with a humility of intellect, which alike with his power of discovery was the wonder of his age, he attributed the massive laurels encircling his broad forehead to “Patience.”
Demosthenes, whose thunderous eloquence shook his native islands, and so long kept the invader at bay, when wishing to make a great effort, would retire to some secret place, with his head shaved, so that decency; if his love of glory failed, should prevent bis appearance in public, and there, in bald-headed solitude, the orator forged his rhetorical thunder-bolts, and with a new growth of locks his beloved Athens received a new speech, which, to this day, is the delight of the scholar, and the mode of the greatest deciaimers. The illustrious. Fox pored over the mighty Greek for years; Brougham even yet in the radiant pleni-. tude of his fame, makes him a close study. A celebrated English judge copied the text-book of his profession no less than five times. Cuvier, the Prince of Naturalists, passed weeks in the examination of a single bone. What immense labor Agassiz must have gone through! What years of toil were those of Herschel before, as he so simply and sublimely expressed, he could look further into space, with its tremendous systems of suns and planets, than any other mortal before him.
Now granting that Sir Isaac’s definition of genius is not the true one, but that genius is a power of itself entirely indepi ndent of patience and work, it would be ridiculous to suppose that the men whom we have mentioued could have accomplished their immortal triumphs without them. How valuable this fact to the aspiring young!- We know that bright-minded and enthusiastic youth are too apt to suppose that they can almost entirely depend on the mere inspiration of genius, ilh ■ you may have ever so rich a quarry, but without the unwearying chisel and mallet the glorious statues will sleep there forever.
The most benificent operation-; of nature are the results of patience. The waters slowly deposit their rich alluvium; the fruits are months in their growth and perfecting.
“Patience and Work?” Ye are the grand, though often painful powers in the hands of man which disclose the-secrets of the universe, subdue the wildness of a continent, adorn the world with the gems of civilization, draw man from his native savagery.
