Moderate Drinking.
I have been asked if ;I opposed moderate drinking on principle. I answer: Yes, most emphatically; I think it a useless and a degrading practice; and not only that, butra dangerous, a terribly dangerous one. Now you have heard all that before, and would consider something new a relief. Of course you have; you know the whole subject from end to end.' But let me in the first place answer you. I am in earnest, yes, my friends, awfully (and that is a large word) in earnest. T hate cant as bad as you do, despise it most thoroughly. No genuineman will indulge such speciousness in argument, and I feel assured that in whatever I may say you will at least not accuse me of insincerity. I oppose moderate drinking chiefly because it is dangerous. In' a regular discussion it might be polite to introduce the minor argument first, but we are not arguing to-day—simply talking, and, let me hope, to some purpose. You are not conscious, my friend, when you are draining the social gla«s that verily “you are entering into temptation.” Did you ever reflect how the poor degraded inebriate began his downward career? No, I am sure you never did, or you would dash the accursed glass forever away from your lips. Remember, he was once a moderate drinker like you. Yon like to reassure yourself by saying: “I am iu no danger; haven’t I control of myself? ” Ah my, friend you, may think so now,’but you know not how long it may last. How many men as brave, strong and noble as yourself have said and thought the same thing? And what was the result? Where are they now? You can answer the question. You know as well as I, for you have seen them; have seen them fall from their high position; have seen them early sink into disgraced, dishonored graves. You say their experience will teach you to avoid their fate. My friend, are you doing it? Are you not i;ather following in their footprints, and are not all the demons of hell behind you urg-ngyou on ? They whisper to you, “ Be not afraid! you have nothing to fear,”—and you, foolishly mistaking their promptings for the assurances of your own conscious strength, are led, not to the brink of a precipice, as you might fancy, but down a long, winding road—like the Grecian youth Plutarch tells us of—whence there is no return. You say you are strong. Then prove it by refusing the glass when it is presented to you. No, you Son’t want to. Ah! my friend, be honest with yourself for once ; you have not the moral courage to refuse, and are painfully aware of it. You are a student, and you have not the opportunity of satisfying that appetite for stimulants. But you indulge it, nurse it—as it were—until it becomes so powerful you cannot control it at all, and when the opportunity comes it bursts through the feeble bonds of your
weak will and you are.disgraced. Yes, disgraced! My friends, I might fill volumes with incidents which have fallen under my own observation; and I feel strongly tempted, to relate one of the saddest I have ever noticed, of a young man fallen from the highest of social positions to the very lowest depth to which a drunkard can descend, and what added a melancholy interest to his sad fate, for me, was this: He was a college graduate. But why need I relate it? You have been out in the world as well as I, and I doubt not could relate many a similar one. And did they convey no warning to you? You are shortly going out in the world for life; you cannot always remain under the protection of Alma Mater. You have a part to play, and you. must be ready. Will you be men? Will you carry with you a brave, strong resolve to avoid the very possibility of a drunkard’s grave, by shunning the demon tempter, or will you go forth enfeebled mentally, physically and morally, conscious of your own weakness, loathing the chains which bind you, always resolving to rend them asunder yet too weak to make the effort, wandering through life, aimless, purposeless, drifted by the slightest gale upon the rocks, and at last sinking into a grateful oblivion ? Or, should you be remembered only as a criminal whose crime was committed while he was intoxicated ? What a record to leave in this world! and how will you appear in the hereafter, when that great book is opened and page after page of your life-record laid before the assembled thousands in the great valley? Then niould oblivion be indeed grateful, but even that is denied you. Will you run the risk?

Editor of The Scholastic:—Dear Sir,—Presuming that a few lines from our snowy home may be of interest to the readers of The Scholastic, I take the liberty of transmitting you an account of several interesting events which have lately transpired at our Alma Mater. Your many readers who have the.happiness of living beneath the flag of the glorious Union are perfectly aware ofthe solemn triduum which was lately solemnized in the States for the purpose of beseeching Divine clemency to alleviate the sufferings of our Holy Father the Pope. Well, though we have not had a triduum, still we have endeavored to add our mite to the general supplications by a grand procession in honor ofthe Blessed Virgin, which took place on the Festival of the Holy Rosary. On the evening of the festival the students of the College, the members of the Community, and the parishioners, united together to inaugurate the celebration with becoming dignity. After passing through the village, bearing relics of our Blessed Lady and chanting the Vespers of the festival, .with the Litany of Loreto, all returned to the village church, where Rev. Father Maloney


THE SCHOLASTIC.
gave solemn Benediction to the devout and prostrate multitude.
The procession, -with its vast array of religious participants, its gorgeous banners, its cross-bearers, acolytes, ecclesiastics and richly-robed priests, was beautiful beyond description. The religious fervor awakened by the honor shown to our Holy and Immaculate Mother was kept aroused aud greatly augmented by the spiritual retreat of the students which was solemnly openedon Wednesday evening, the 8th inst., by a soul-stirring exhortation in French and English, from Rev. W. O’Mahoney, C. S. C., and Rev. P. Beaudet, C. S. C., the former of whom was to conduct the exercises for the English-speaking students, the latter those for the French. The retreat continued during the three remaining days of the week, and ended on Sunday morning, the 12th inst.
The behavior of the students during the exercises was irreproachable ; their recollected manner during the recreations, and their silence within the house, bore witness to the salutary effect of the exertions of the zealous directors, npon whom too much praise cannot be bestowed for their whole-souled endeavors to.render the retreat a success; unremiting in their labors, they toiled unceasingly from daylight till dark in their holy zeal, and on Sunday last had the unalloyed pleasure of beholding every student of the house united in the bond of Christian charity by the reception of the Most Holy Sacrament of'the Eucharist.
Yesterday, the 13th inst., being the patronal festival of the Very Rev. Fr. Sorin, Superior General of the Ordtr of the Holy Cross, solemn high Mass was celebrated, after which, out of respect to him, our revered and venerable friend, a grand holiday was accorded the jubilant students.
As the retreat occupied the greater part of the preceding week, all preparation for this grand fete, so dear to the heart of every Religous of the Holy Cross, and to every student who has become attached to our venerated Superior by his kind word or beaming smile, was entirely overlooked; but the members of the St. Patrick’s Literary Association, ever on hand, ready and willing, under the supervision of their Moderator, Rev. W. O’Mahony, assumed that morning the joyous responsibility of presenting in the evening an entertainment which would not only do honor to their society and the. college, but would be a worthy tribute of esteem and regard to him who has done so much good for Canada and her institutions.
The time was short, but the Rev. Moderator with the members of the society entered heart and soul into the preparation of the entertainment, and the result was that a literary seance such as has never been equalled within the-walls of our beloved college was presented to the students aud faculty to do honor to 'the feast which we celebrated.	'	■
At 7. p. m. all the students assembled in the College study hall, which was arranged very tastefully for the occasion, the Rev. Superior, F. Geoffrion, attended by our ex-Superior, P. Beaudet, Rev. Fathers Shortis and Meehan, with other religious and ecclesiastics, entered and took the positions reserved for them, while the hall rang again and again with reiterated -cheers of welcome. The entertainment was decidedly lierary and refiued and reflects great credit upon all engaged. Dedicating it to our venerated Superior General, they may well be justly proud of the success which they have achieved. *

Chorus “ Home, sweet home 1”
Each member engaged in the seance acquitted himself most honorably, and attached additional laurels to his. chaplet of already well-earned fame. The opening chorus was excellently rendered by the St. Patrick Glee Club, an organization of several weeks’ existence, with real American spirit, and freedom breathed from every note.
Mr. Jas. Coyle,, the talented essayist, may honestly take a laudable pride in his eulogy on our Rev. Superior General, which, though gotten up in the hurry and confusion of Monday, faithfuly indicates the mine of talent which lies beneath his bluff, good-natured exterior. As it was well remarked, Mr. J„ Bowles was the soul 'of the entertainment ; for, while the audience, overcome by the declamer in the sublime portrayal of mighty deed, or silently reflective under the influence of the philosophy of the essayist, rests meditatively quiet, the sweet and thrilling notes of his silvery-toned flute steals softly over their minds, and as he gradually swells in tone, leads them onward, till, as he concludes with a patriotic strain, they make the very welkin ring with applause. W. B. Meenan admirably sustained his reputation as a declaimer and vocalist.	.
Mr. H. Carroll won an enviable reputation by his song and essay. The essay of Mr. Pyue was a gem; his reputation as an essayist is well established at St. Laurent. Mr. D. McCarthy in his declamation, and J. McCarthy in his song and declamation, added new trophies of victory to their already valuable store.
Mr. F. Hobein still stands pre-eminently forward as a talented essayist, whose language is extremly beautiful. The essay and declamation of Mr. Kane reflect great credit on this gentleman, and presage for him an extraordinary future.
Mr. M. O’Hare in his .declamaton, Mr. P. Kelly in his instrumental solos, and Mr. Boylan as vocalist, were very successful, and contributed in no small degree to the general entertainment. Mr. H. Vian, our able and efficient Prof, of Music, presided at the piano, and rendered grand aid to the several vocalists, while he confirmed his reputation as a first-class pianist.
Before the grand finale, Mr. Jas. Coyle stepped forward and in a few extempore remarks, stating that the patronal festival of Rev. Fr. Sorin was also the festival of our Assist-

i	ant Super or at St. Laurent, the "Rev. Edward Meehan, con-
/graiulated him on his good fortune in having for his patron
-so great a saint, and on his successful imitation of the bea-tided confessor. He also expressed the good will of the ■	students towards Father Meehan, and hoped that it would
'	ever be reciprocal. Father Meehan then thanked the stu-
. dents for their good wishes, and hoped their mutual affection would ever remain inviolate. After a few remarks by our Rev. Superior and Fathers Shortis and O’Mahoney, complimenting the students who took part in the entertainment, and .eulogizing the Rev. Superior General, we J	retired to rest, each joyous in having offered his quota to
the honor of our reverend and venerable friend.

St. Joseph’s College, Cin., Ohio. '
Cincinnati, Oct. 1,1873.
Editor Scholastic :—The remembrance of past favors assures us that a few lines from Cincinnati will not be.un-acceptable. We do not propose to criticise the late Exposition. or to express our views on the present financial panic, but will content ourselves with a few words in re gard to an institution that is not unknown to many ol your readers.
St. Joseph’s College, of this city, conducted by the Congregation of the Holy Cross, entered on its third year 1	Sept 1st.
!	The number of pupils received during the first week
was upwards of one hundred and fifty; at present there are nearly two hundred in daily attendance, and there is every reason to believe that the number will be still further increased. The work of the year has-commenced in earnest: the classes are taught regularly, and the faculty . are working harmoniously under the direction of the Su-
i	perior, Rev. P. W. Condon, C. S. C. The pupils are punc-
|	tual in their attendance and are actively-engaged in pros-
f	- ecuting their studies, and we feel confident that while the
office of Director of Studies is filled by Bro. Boniface, ,	C. S. C., late President of St Mary’s College, Galveston,
Texas, the interests of the pupils will not be neglected.
Strange as it may appear, the only serious inconvenience under which the College labors is to be attributed to its prosperity. Want of sufficient room is beginning to befelt. p	Yet in a very short time the College will be compelled
either to refuse applications for admission or enlarge'the building, which can only be done by purchasing more extensive property. But as the College is now established upon a firm basis, and its success guaranteed beyond all reasonable doubt, it is more than probable that the necessary means will be adopted to enable it to enlarge its sphere, of action.
It seems that hard work agrees with all the members of .the faculty as it would be impossible to find a more healthy .	-body of men. This happy state of affairs is partly due to-
the climate, and partly owing to the care and forethought _ of the Steward, Bro. NiiZttiits, who is wanting in none of the rare qualities that are required for that < fli.e. Mr. O'-
Shea, C. S. C., is busily engaged in imparting a; knowledge of the classics to an appreciative class. The many friends of Prof. C. A. B. von Weller will be pleased to learn that he is successfully exercising his profession at the College so there is no fear that. the twin arts music and drawing will be neglected. If success be the reward of industry and energy, directed by intelligence, we can confidently say that St. Joseph’s College is on the way of becoming one of the most successful institutions in the city. Which news will no doubt be as pleasing to you as it is to	-

We see it reported that the “hero” of Caprera has offered hjs services to the Madrid Government to fight against the Royalists, and that the offer has been declined. Senors Castelar and Silmeron must be but too desirous to clutch at any bramble that may offer them a chance of safety in their present desperate predicament; and they would not have given the cold shoulder to Gari-baidi had they placed any value on his military prowess, or on his power to render any valuable service in the field. But the specimen afforded by the performances of himself and his followers at and about Dijon in the winter of 1870-^1 prove that he could do nothing more than increase the difficulties of any Government in Spain. If we may believe the London Times' account of his doings at the period we have mentioned, he went to France merely to wreak his ven-gence on Catholic priests, monks, and nuns. The Times of that date said that “ the very women of Vesoul and Antun cried shame upon him for his anti-clerical prejudices, and that Gambetta himself had to rescue out of his hands a priest whom he had sent before a court martial, and whom he would have shot as a Prussian spy. The Times also-asserted that he was so egregiously incompetent for military command in regular warfare, that he allowed himself to be hoodwinked by Manteuffel, and by leaving Bourbaki unprotected, was one principal cause of that unfortunate officer’s rout and disgrace. At that very time he was blowing his own trumpet and claiming a great victory. He managed, in the confusion of the time, to get himself elected to the Assembly; but his appearance there was not much more satisfactory than his performances in the field. His speeches were received with silent contempt, and he left the Chamber unnoticed, venting his maledictions on “the priests.” We are not surprised that the Spanish Republicans, hard up as they are for friends and allies, should have evinced no desire for the co-oneration of Garibaldi.	-
The correspondent of the New York World, writing of the celebrated physician Nelaton, says:
Nelaton’s funeral took place day before yesterday. The pallbearers were Drs. Depaul, Demarquay, Bouillaud and Bonebar. din. There was an immense crowd. The body was buried in Pere la Chaise, but no speeches were made at the grave; he had positively forbidden them. The night before he died he said to his son and sons-in-law: “Do a great deal of good in this world, but make as little noise in it as yon can.” He received, in a most edifying manner, the last Sacraments of the Roman Catholic Church. His will opens: “I desire my wife to train up our son with sentiments of religion, honor and industry.” He received, Hie day bef->re lie died, two letters from the Empress and one from the Prince Imperial; .he was deeply touched by t hem. ’

Mb Shickey is as usual very accommodating to visitors going to Notre Dame and St. Mary’s. We expect soon to see his new ’bus driving majestically down the avenue. We have heard serious complaints against some of the drivers of the livery teams for their extortions practiced upon persons going to the College or the Academy. Sime have charged $4. for a trip to the College. Let our friends, remember that for 50 cents Mr. Shickey will carry them safe to either Notre Dame or St. Mary’s. We trust that the owners of the livery stables of South Bend will lo< k to their interest and their good name, and discharge dishonest drivers.
“ The Chimes,” composed by twelve of the most beautiful belles of St. Mary’s, sounded a charming welcome last Sunday evening. We felt highly flattered by the invitation extended to us, and our anticipations of passing a pleasant evening were fully realized as we sat in a classically melancholy attitude and listened to the silvery tones of Miss Nellie Gross, who read the first number of “The Chimes” that has appeared this year. Prose and poetry, grave and gay, downwright practical and ethereally sentimental, the articles were read over; one after the other, variety and diversity adding to the pleasure that was given by the intrinsic merit of each succeeding article. We were much pleased with the good judgment displayed in giving long space to local news.	.	•	\

Herman Conant & Go’s. General Advertising Bureau may be just as good a General Advertising Bureau as'any-body else’s General Advertising Bureau. But our opinion is that, quoad printers, General Advertising Bureaus are' humbugs. From some of them we have received proposals to advertise some wonderful book to the extent of half a column, for which they offer the munificent compensation of one dollar per annum—they to furnish an electrotype, and we to mail them our paper regularly every week. A pretty good way to get an advertisement inserted for nothing and our paper gratis. Another gentleman—from New Jersey we think,—offers us several bottles of wine, if we insert a regular advertisement every week, besides putting 32 or 52— we forget the exact number—editorial notices in our editorial columns; and has the coolness to send the editorials already written—cut and dried—telling how “we” can vouch for the extraordinary qualities, &c., of the wine; and that before we could have a chance of even smelling the bottle. Now, good wine is a good, thing: we have Scripture for it. And New Jersey wine may be a good thing, for aught we know to the contrary. Still we think it must be rather thin to require so much puffing for so few bottles.
. And now comes a postal card from Herman Conant and Go’s General Advertising Bureau with an advertisement praising up old London Dock Gin, and thereunto is appended a letter stating that if we put the advertisement in our paper to the amount of §16 and then send them $16 in cash they will send us four cases of their stuff.
Now we think it would be just as bad pay as a printer or editor could get if the advertisement were paid for in gin. But the man’s head must be already fuddled with gin to suppose that’an editor, not yet having his head fuddled with London Dock, would accept his proposition not only to rereceive gin in payment for advertisement, but also to pay out of pocket $16 cash for the stuff.
Advertising is a good thing, we know, and should be I paid for. And legal tender is greenbacks, not London Dojk.

The Students'of St. Laurent, Canada, are wide-awake and go-ahead youths as is shown, by the short time they made in getting up their seance for the due celebraton of St. Edward’s Day. We hope to hear often from “ Yankee” and “ Celt."
It would give us pleasure to publish the eulogy of Very Rev. Father Superior General spoken by Mr. Jas. Coyle of St. Laurent’s College, at the celebration of St. Edward’s Day, and no doubt it would give much pleasure to our readers. But the pages of the Scholastic were so heavily cut down that we must forego the pleasure from sheer lack of space.
It is one of the old-fashioned pleaures, which used to fill our hearts about as near as it could be in this land of changeable weather, that the arrival of Blaine Walker from Montana gives us. He brings his sisters Julia and Maggie to St Mary’s, and his youngest brother Robert and his Cousin Fenlon Blaine to the College. We hope his stay among us may be long.
Although we have not published Florian O'Day’s metrical account of the celebration of St. Edward’s Day, both because we had already in type a prose account of it, and because Florian’s was ioo hastily written, we would not have it thought we considered it as having no merit. It had so much merit that we would not do the writer the injustice of printing it with the defects and imperfections which on careful revising he would have made all right.
The wonderful rebuilding of Chicago is splendidly illustrated in a work lying on one of the parlor tables. It bears the title “Rebuilt Chicago” on its graceful cover.

At about a quarter of ten the crowd began to gather from all quarters of Notre Dame, and dispose itself as best it might around the edge of the lake. Every available spot was taken up. So great was the wish to get a good view of the proceedings that even the tree* were brought into requisition.
Promptly at the time appointed, the crews took their places, and the signal being given, dashed off at a telling pace to the harmonious strains of “Get up and get,” executed by the N. D. IT. C. B., which we do not hesitate to pronounce one of the best organizations at Notre Dame. Headed by their obliging leader, Mr. Gillespie, they are always ready to take part in any of our college exercises. But it is not our intention to write a eulogy on the Band or their leader, but simply toreport the result of the boat-race. There they go with “along pull,—a strong pull, and a pull all together! ” The Santa Maria takes the lead and keeps it all the way up the lake. But the Pinta is not to be beaten; up she conics.—nnkes a b an’ifnl turn, and starts down the lake nearly two boat-lengths ahead. Tais is kept up

•until ■within fifty or sixty yards of the goal. The Santa Maria does splendidly; the boys make a desperate spurt in .answer to the calls of their friends on shore. But it is no use, the Pinta quickens stroke and glides in—victor by a' boat’s length. Both crews then pull for the boat-house amid the hearty cheers of those on shore. The Band played “Home, Sweet Home.”
The crew of the Santa Maria lay their defeat in a great measure to their antagonists having the better boat. We do not know but what they are more than half right. We think it would be a good idea to put another boat on the lake, and one that will rival the Pinta.
The following are the names and positions of the crews.—Pinta—D. J. Hogan, stroke oar; 0. J. Dodge, 2nd ■oar; C. H. Berdel,-3rd oar; H. W: Walker, bow oar and captain; Louis Hayes, coxswain. Santa Maria—D. E Maloney, stroke oar and captain; E. S. Graves, 2nd oar J. D. Christy, 3rd oar; E. J. McLaughlin, bow oar; Al fred Horne, coxswain.	R. S.

The fourth regular meeting took place on Oct. 1st. At this meeting the following members gave recitations and read compositions: F. Egan’s “Dying Confederate” was well delivered; T. Sweeger spoke the “Millstone” pretty well; J. McGrath’s “ Shoo-Fly ” was full of wings; B. Baca's Spanish speech brought down the house; 0. Tong’s “Launching of the Ship of State” was a little too slow; W. Meyer’s “Dream” was interesting; J. Beegan’s ‘‘Rome” was well displayed; B. LeFevre’s “French Address” was gracefully given; W. Gross made his “Brigade at Fontenoy” fight bravely; W. Breen’s “Spirit of the Present Age” was full of life; C. Furer’s "Friendship’’ was loyal; J. McHugh’s “Youth ” was not lasting; J. Marks ‘‘Autumn” was full of fruit; J.Cullen’s “Marco Bozarris’ •was well conned to memory but not well spoken; S. Schmidt’s declamation on grammar was amusing; C. J. M. Ruger’s “ Conversation ” was grammatical. Master C. Frese ' then presented himself for membership and was unani' ously elected. Messrs. C. Berdel and C. Dodge.closed the ex" ercises with two very interesting declamations which were received with well merited applause.

On. Tuesday afternoon the pupils bad the privilege of performing one of those duties which impart true joy to the Christian heart, viz.: the visiting and relieving a distressed and afflicted family of little children deprived by fire of their mother and their home.
The pupils learn by such exercises of charity to appreciate the blessings by which they themselves are surrounded, and to have a practical sympathy for their suffering neighbor.
For the consolation of the parents and relatives of the pupils, it is a pleasure to state that good health and cheerfulness prevails in every department. The long Roll of Honor printed every week proves that the pupils are determined in their efforts to sustain their excellent standing in department and classes.
