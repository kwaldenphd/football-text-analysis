“IF I WERE A EING.”
A Drama in Four Acts.
[ACT II—Scene II Continued.]
Stepecano. I know not who he is; but if again The scoundrel crosses me he’ll learn the taste Of shot and powder. You men, watch your Chance to end this slippery business. Shoot the Prince!
Cerano. I understand you, captain.
Stephano. {To the Bandits.)
Meantime, Be ready for an adventure. Ruisco Left but a moment since. He counts on you.
All. We are on hand!
Lucio. No fear. Our blades are keen.
Scene III.	.
Bay of Ischia.
(Banquo alone, with hath hands, to his e irs as if frightened nearly to death.)
Banquo. (Trembling.)
I have my senses left—but oh, my stars, I don’t see how it happened! Never man Lived through such fright as I have just escaped. Having my brains blown out, and like as not Won’t get a ‘cent of money from those knaves I How sad to think there is no honest way For people to make money ! Had there been, I would avoid these troubles. As it is, My need of money may yet cost my life.
I know not what to do, except to hide; For I could not endure another fright Like that among the robbers. Maybe, though, My troubles come because I have done wrong In stealing those two boys, heirs to the throne. I may have often treated them unkind, And now I get my pay for it. I’ll go	_
And find some lonely cavern, and will stay Till all this fright is over. I’ll take A hermit’s cowl, and keep me out of sight, And say my prayers, for fear I may be shot.
Out on that old Ruisco! He it was
Who first imposed upon my ignorance. ’Twas he Involved me in this trouble.- Wicked wretch!
[Exit Banquo.]
Scene IV.
(Valerio alone—Enter Baptisto, Cecato, Silvio, Phil-ippo and Marco.)
Marco. Valerio, where’s Genaro? Valerio. I don’t know.
I cannot tell how he could get away W ithout my knowing, for I fell asleep
Lying beside him; but when I awoke '
I could not find him, hunting far and near. .
Cecato. {Puzzled.)
Where can the boy have gone ?
What shall we do ?
Baptisto. Do! Why, go on to Naples to be sure.
Silvto. What! go without Genaro! -
Baptisto. Why, of course!	-
Silvio. They’ll think we have gone crazy !
Baptisto. No, indeed;
They’ll take us for a set of honest boys.	,
Philippo. But shall we dare to go with these old clothes
Before the Court of Naples?	-	•
Cecato. Yes; or, if not,	. -
We’ll turn them inside out to make	; £
Them clean. That’s a grand invention! ", Baptisto. Boys, I think
We should not make this fun. As to.our clothes, We have no second suits, so must wear these. But what we say is the important point.
Cecato, though, can talk just like Genaro:
Cecato must be speaker.
Cecato. {With an air of importance.)
That I will.
Now, if I had fine clothes— But never mind: I’ll get a wig and whiskers, then my face Will be more dignified. Of course the king • Will pay attention to what I say then.	'
‘Baptisto. What will you say?
Cecato. {Indignantly.) “Your majesty!” You goat, You think I don’t know how they do at Court? •
Baptisto. {Argumentatively.)	-
Why no, Cecato; but for all us boys	-
’Tis best to know when each one ought to speak.	’
Cecato. {About to leave.)	-
I’ll go and get my whiskers and my wig—
Then I can do it better. {Exit.)	-
Silvio. {Knowingly.) Cecato
Is really smart. He well knows what is what!
{Enter Cecato with wig and whiskers—AU clap their hands in applause of his appearance.)
Cecato. Baptisto, you must stand at my right side;
You, Silvio on my left; Philippo, you
Stand close behind Baptisto. Marco, hoy—
Go stand by Silvio. Now do this way:
{AU do as directed by Cecato.)
Stand strong on your left foot, your right foot out;
Heads up, just like the soldiers.
Valerio. May I not go to Court with all the rest? Cecato. Oh yes, you birdie! You were quite forgot! Valerio. I want to find Genaro.
Cecato. Like enough
We’ll meet him on the way. You shall stand here, * {Gives Valerio a place in front of himself.) ’
274	THE SCHOLASTIC.
I’ll say: “YourMajesty: We shepherd'boys Have something bad to tell ”—{gesticulates.) .
Baptisto. That is not nice.
Say something that will show we are afraid He will not listen.
Cecato. (Making a second effort.)
Well: “YourMajesty, We know that shepherd boys have little hope
' To gain an audience, yet well we know That loyal subjects must inform the king When wicked men conspire against the crown.” .
{AU dap their hands in approval.)
Silvto. Delightful! Genaro couldn’t do better.
Let’s write it down, so that you won’t forget.	.
Cecato. (While Silvio writes.)
Baptisto, you must say that one of us Has overheard a very wicked plot.
(Scratches his head.) ’Tis badjwithout Genaro—that’s a fact! What were these fellows’ names ? I can’t think.
Baptisto. The king will ask us questions by that time— And that will do.
(Eying Cecato.J Veiy grand! you look like my grand’ father.
Cecato. Let us go. We have to save our kingdom. Boys, walk majestic! Boys, all walk like me 1 Keep step with me. Remember!
All. Yes, we will.
{All strut off the stage.—Martial music.) END OF SECOND ACT.
- ACT THIRD.
‘	Scene I.
Royal Hall.
(King Ferdinand, Alonzo, Melchiore, Orazzo, Prince Alberto, Marino, Beppo, Lino, Guido, and Verdi.) Ferdinand. Nobles and friends, we have for you to-day A most romantic pastime. All of you Have a prime part to play. I abdicate
My crown, my throne, in favor of a joke.	'
Melchiore. An abdication, worthy Ferdinand, Whose merry heart is worth a world of prowess.
Ferdinand. (Gaily.)
Melchiore likes the diplomatic farce
Of laughter and good cheer. Well, he is right:
Rome once was saved by the cackling of the geese.	.
Melchiore. A joke, too, might save Naples, if in truth Naples were not secure from danger. Ah, A long-faced monarch should invite the plague, Invasion, conflagration, and ill-luck!
Your jovial majesty, on the other hand, Spreads peace, content and plenty o’er the land.
Alberto. But. what’s the joke, my father ?
Ferdinand. It is this:
In our excursion we by chance came near A fold of sheep, and lying on the ground Behold a shepherd in light slumber. Now, Mirth-loving Melchiore, with keen ears, Heard a low strain flow from the dreamer’s lips:	.
We all drew near to listen, and the boy Was chanting plaintively: “If I were a king.” Melchiore laughed at this anomaly;
But to amuse you, and give the swain
A taste of royalty to meet his wish,	.
We saw him fast asleep, then lifted him
Most cautiously on a litter, and asleep
Brought him to Naples. For three days to come He shall be king. My courtiers, act your part Gravely and seriously; make the youth believe You never knew a mandate but his own.
Orazzo. Hold 1	.
What, should he give preposterous orders ?
Melchiore. {Laughing.) Then
An insurrection! Meditate, my lords!
What, should this joke end in an insurrection?
Alonzo. {Laughing.)
I should stand by to quell it. Give the joke, Your Majesty; we thank you for a joke.
Ferdinand. Whate’er this king commands shall be obeyed,	’
As if I gave the order. Understand:	’
Melchiore shall be master of the fun, And mystify the youth so he will think
Himself transformed indeed—quite turned a king.	.
Alberto. To make him feel at home, some one should ring
Sweet little sheep-bells; then the lambs should bleat.
Melchiore. (Caressing Alberto.)
No, my young Prince; your scheme would break the charm,—
He would be still a shepherd.	|
Ferdinand. Ah, my child,	-
Your plan would be too homelike. Everything
Must be completely royal. Let each one
Appear in regal robes of state.
Verdi. (Gleefully.) -
’fwill be magnificent! Our lowest bows. '
Must greet the Shepherd King.
Lino. And, Guido, you
Must stand to bear his train on the left.
Guido. {Dissatisfied.) I’d rather on the right—you on the left.
Alberto. But, Guido, Lino’s place is on the right.
Verdi. Now, pageants,’ do not quarrel; or don’t laugh, Lino. {Bursting into an immoderate fit of laughter.)
I cannot help it. I’m sure I can’t.
Verdi. We ought to have some story very droll, To make it seem that we but laughed at that.
Alberto. Why should you laugh? Laughter will spoil the joke.	’
Verdi. May be. If we can help, we won’t. If not, I will pretend to stumble and fall down.
Lino. To fall would not be courtly.
Verdi. What of that!
Fancy that clown once reeling through the hall
Like a schooner in a gale. Look here!
Those peasant boys walk this way :
(He mimics a peasant's walk.)
Alberto. No. . Not all.
I saw one peasant who walked like a prince.
He did not walk as you walk.
Verdi. How walked he ?'
Alberto. Most graciously., As well as you or I.
Ferdinand. Delay not, Melchiore. Let us haste.
See everything prepared. Do not forget
That none shall say to me, “ Your Majesty.”
Should they, I will not answer. Bear in mind!
Melchiore. I promise for the Court.
- Ferdinand. Dispatch affairs,
Or his recumbent highness will awake.	-
T HE S C HO L AS T IC .	275
Beppo. We have lost patience waiting,	-
Verdi. (Laughing.) That is true;
But now we all are ready for the sport.
(Exeunt gaily.—Music.)
Scene II.
Royal Reception Chamber.
(Bozza and Servants. Enter Marino, Guido, and Lupo, bringing Genaro, clothed in royal robes, on a litter.)
Bozza. He makes a pretty picture, and in truth Could we but know the youthful peasant’s dream It would be very marvellous.
Lupo. Ho doubt
Of magic castles, and bright feathered birds, And beautiful gazelles, and flowers that speak. Oh 1 I have dreamed such dreams an hundred times.
Bozza. But this poor youth should have been left To comfort parents who will mourn his loss at home. Think of the pangs they suffer! I must say King Ferdinand degrades his dignity.
And will regret this folly. When we mock The poor and friendless we but curse ourselves, And shall receive rebuke. I feel ashamed, O ld man as I am, joining in this farce, Though young, and old, we must obey the king, Marino. (While they lay Genaro on-a sofa.) These robes lie graceful on him. If a prince He could not wear a more majestic smile.
Bozza. (Discovering the white lock in Genaro's hair.) What does that mean? Marino, do you see? (Points.)
Marino. I see the boy’s head, Bozza, What of that ? Bozza. That lock of hair, white as a Greek’s camice. Marino. (Observingit closely.) That is unusual!
Bozza. (Withfeeling.) Were the queen alive,
The lovely queen as gentle as a flower,	’
And thoughtful as an angel; did she live, She would but love this youth for that white lock.
Marino. He is indeed most comely; but that lock Adds nothing to his beauty in my eyes.
Bozza. (Speaking mysteriously.)	•
Speak not of that. I’ve seen the joy and grief— Within this palace for these twenty years I’ve seen the changes. They are sad enough. But I alone have memory of the griefs.
(Enter Melchiore.) '
Melchiors. Have you the new king ready?
Bozza. Ah! my lord
Melchiore, in the Court—to which we look For gravity and truth.—I blush to see Proud noblemen descending to play jokes. The king ignores his danger; in his mirth Ignores the past, forgets that one day since The Prince escaped so narrowly from death.
Melchiore. For this we should make merry. Good old man’
Desist from gloomy words; and prompt obey The new king cheerfully. Bozza, depart! The shepherd youth is waking, and the scene Of his proud elevation must be cleared.
Bozza. How totally degenerate the Court! A jest has cast a monarch from his throne, And made his royal diadem a toy	-
To cheat an unoffending shepherd boy.
Scene III.	. . -
J	> ‘ t
(Genaro, arousing, and looking about.)^
Genaro. How strange this place appears! I went to rest	_	. '
Upon the greensward close beside the bay, -	■
I cannot be mistaken! Dreams cannot
Steal semblance of the real so exact! .
This place is like a palace. ’ This mild air . , . _ ■ Is glittering with a splendor fairer yet
Than dreams can paint.
(Enter Melchiore and Lupo.)	.
Melchiore. Paying homage.)
.. Your majesty, I pray That you most graciously do condescend	~
To make jour orders known unto the Court.	;
Genaro. (Rising to his feet.)	.
My orders, sir? I understand you not!	'
I am not in command.	.
(He makes demonstrations as if to assure himself of hit .	identity.)	.
Melchiore. (Inclining more profoundly.)'
. Your majesty!	■
We are your courtiers true; yon are our king.
Genaro. (With dignity.)	-	.	'
I beg you, sir, do not impose on one	. _
Who ne’er has harmed you. Tell me where I am.
Melchiore. In your own palace, most benignant Prince.
Genaro. Mock me no more! Inform me who you are, And by what freak of fortune I am here.	*
Melchiore. Your royal highness, know you not your Court—	:
And your most loyal subjects ? We await
To execute your bidding. Pray, command!
Genaro. (Frankly.)	.
In truth, good friends, I’m puzzled. Am I not	'
Genaro, the poor shepherd? Where are those ’	-
I love so well ? Valerio, my brother,—
Cecato and Baptisto?—can you tell?—
Where are those youths who tend the flocks with me?
Explain this transformation!
Melchiore. In good faith,	.	.	'
Your gracious highness maketh strange discourse . Of persons you before have never named;	.	„
No doubt they are the creatures of your dreams. And have no true existence.	:
Genaro. Gentle sir,	-
Seek not to prove that I have grown insane. .	.
I am a shepherd lad: I watch the sheep	.
Under a man named Banquo. Now our flock Feeds by the wave of Ischia. Pray, reveal
The cause which brought me hither? for my friends, Though poor, are dear as though of royal blood.
Deceive me then no more.	•
Melchiore. Upon my heart
Your royal highness is at this good hour
The mighty king of Naples. Sceptre and lands, Annies and castles, await your behest.
But, gracious sovereign, as you seem disturbed,— A perturbation from unpleasant dreams,—
We will depart, and at another time
Come to receive your orders.	. r
Genaro. Do you mean . ’ .	. .	“
To leave me now to solve this painful doubt? : ;

The account of the Base-Ball match between the Quicksteps and Tom Thumbs, though well written, is too long for mention in our short columns.
Oue thanks to the reporter of the Debate of last Tuesday evening. The report was banded iu too late for publication this week, but will appear in full in our next issue.
We were much pleased to meet with an old student of ’60, Mr. George Gardner, who is now doing business in Hillsdale. He was in excellent health, and on his way East.
“Adrift*
The readers of the Ave Marla will be delighted to hear that'in a week or two we shall begin publishing a new story, entitled “Adrift,” written expressly for the Ave Maria by Mrs. Anna H. Dorsey, whose charming style they have so often admired in the pages of our Blessed Mother’s Journal. The scene is laid in the Eastern States, and will, we doubt not, prove highly interesting, as all of her stories in the Ave Mabia have hitherto done. We are happy to announce that this gifted writer devotes her pen almost exclusively to the Aye Maria.
Fly-Catches.
The Debate was very good. The new fence has been painted. The orchard has been sowed in oats. No more toirees; we hear, this session. Hand-Ball flourishes most after supper. Championship has perished; let it B. I. P, Bro, Jambs has charge of the Apprentices. We occasionally think of Summer even now. The recreation after supper is very pleasant. Catching fly-ball is an amusement after supper. Hard work still continues in the Classes. Good. The United Scientific Association has reorganized. The “ purp" has not visited the College this Spring yet Can a meal be squared ? Yes,- a great many can do this. WALKS-ardnnd the lake are pronounced very pleasant; A Scientific Entertainment is said to be in preparation. Bro. Bonaventure has been very busy transplating flowers.
The Senior Basehallists have, a weU very handy $ a little to the east of the Play-hall.
A good game of base-ball was played between twosecoud nines; the score stood 8 to 9 in nine innings.
The 1st of May not being a fine day, the students did not ask for recreation until the next day, when it was granted.
Thebe would be less grumbling at umpires if some of our players better understood the game and rules of baseball.
If you hear anything, multiply it by two before you tell it; in this way a flue truthful (?) report may be easily started.
“The Excelsiors” have not suffered a single defeat, and, we feel pretty confident, will not. But we don’t mean to discourage.
Base-haul is the life of the recreation hours, and hence it is that we have so much to say about it, though we do get behind occasionally.
Linguistic.—Some one observes that the corruption of the word “recreation" nAou rec" is an exemplification of the phonetic changes that living languages are constantly undergoing—very slowly of course.
Base Ball.—There are so many good games- of ball nowadays that it is almost impossible for one to keep track of them all. But the games of this year have to make up in number what they lack in excellence when compared to those of last year.
The wales which had been so well trodden down in the Seniors’ front-yard have been changed and removed, so that now as we come out of the yard the walk has two branches—one leading towards the Study-hall, the other towards the Post-office. The front yard is beginning to look very tasty.
The Lakes are much higher than they were,owing to the recent rains; in fact we never saw them so high. There does not seem to be much probability of their drying up for a few years yet. However, the fishermen do not have extra good luck, though they are patient and persevering. Several excursions have been made on the old pier.
The Weather is becoming warmer, and apprizes us that June is near at hand. The Spring showers have nearly done, and we have become accustomed to fine weather. The fishermen continue their sport, but the nimrods have given up. The boats are much used, and the crews have long since commenced to practice. Of course "mibs” continue to roll.
Being Read.—The Seniors have finished “Irving’s Life of Washington,” and are now listening to a very excellent work entitled “ Getting on in the World,”—by Prof. Matthews of Chicago University. It is indeed a happy effort, and the finest work we have heard in our refectory for some time: written in a very pleasing, plain and pointed style, and tempered with just enough wit to render it interesting to listen to without becoming tired, and the subjects discussed are treated of in a manner remarkably clear and logical. Indeed the work speaks highly of the literary abilities of its author. It is generally well listened to by those present.
It is seldom we have the pleasure of attending so really entertaining an exhibition of musical talent as it was our good fortune to be present at on the evening of the 27th ult. Notre Dame’s musical star again appears ascendant. Some one said, in our hearing, that we were making a retrograde movement in the music line here at Notre Dame.
THE SCHOLASTIC.	277
What does he, what can he say now, after listening to the ‘•delicious floods of harmony” with which we were regaled on the evening in question? He qan only echo the general verdict “ that it was excellent,” and that we are progressing instead of retrograding; in fact we are “coming in like old Dexter on a home stretch.” If he would not be speaking classical English he would at least be telling the truth, and that is all we ask of anyone.
We will not weary our readers by following out the long programme in detail, but will simply mention those most deserving of praise. First, of course, comes the not not to be too much praised N. D. U. Quartette. The Entertainment would have been worth attending if only to hear them. Little Tommy Hooley was the favorite of the evening, if the vociferous encore of which he was the recipient is any criterion. The soprani and alti of the Vocal Class certainly make a good appearance; their great improvement is apparent. The Junior Orchestra also greatly increased the enjoyment of the evening, but would have made a far better effect if all the instruments had been in tune. Messrs. G. Burger, J. Campbell, W. Ohlen, E. Ohmer, A. Schmidt, and H. Quan, all performed well, and added much to the success of the Entertainment.
Notre Dame affords superior advantages aud holds out extra inducements to those desirous of pursuing a thorough musical course. In most of the institutions supported by the State, music is not taught, and in the others it is not made a specialty. The capacious building here, separated from the main building of the College, oilers many advantages. Opportunities for the study of the organ, piano, string and wind instruments, harmony, etc., are given; and the numerous musical organizations, such as the Choir, Orchestra, Cornet Band, etc., give ample occasion to put into practice the instructions received in instrumental and vocal music.

Sural Happiness. .
A countiy life is not all made up of sunshine and bliss. It is not, entirely, made up of those romantic pictures of love, happiness and innocence which poets delight to paint of it—pictures, the subjects of which are to be found only in the dreamy brains of poets themselves, and which are as visionary as was the belief in the existence of Hy-Braal or Eldorado.
A country life is composed of stern realities. It has its clouds as well as its sunshine. In most cases, it requires a greater or less amount of manual labor. Yet, though it may have its clouds, there is always a certain quietness and innocence prevailing, which serve to dispel these clouds; and though it may require a certain amount of manual labor, this labor is always the promoter of sound health, without which life, even in thiernan oge, would not possess the least joy.
Most persons born in a town do not believe that there is the least pleasure or amusement to be had in a country life. In their eyes, life in the country is nothing more than a continual drudgery from morn till night—a life fit for slaves only. True, indeed, country people seldom have an opportunity of engaging in the debauches or revels to be found only in the city. They do not attend the masquerades nor frequent the brilliant ball-rooms which seem fo possess such charms for city folks. But to persons born and reared in the country, the rural amusements in which they participate have more real pleasure connected with them, and are also far better adapted to physical and moral improvement than are those of the city. In no country, it may be almost truly said, are rural amusements indulged in to a.less extent than in the United States; and as yet it could not be otherwise. The persons inhabiting the country districts live too far apart, and are too few in number, to indulge in those rural amusements which are to be found in European countries. The French peasantry, although not much given to rural sports, seem to enjoy as much real happiness as is to be fonnd in any other country. The peasant, after his day’s work is over, is to be found quietly enjoying his glass of wine and cigar under the shade " of the trailing vines which encircle his neat cot. Here, surrounded'by his family, he seems the very picture of happiness.
The peasantry of Italy are very much given to amusement. Who ever visited an Italian village on a summer’s evening without experiencing a feeling of delight at beholding the inhabitants engaged in their innocent pastimes ? Here and there are to be seen groups, some engaged in the dance, others singing the beautiful songs of their native land, and all seeming perfectly happy and contented.
No country in the world, perhaps, can compare with Ireland for its rural amusements. Here are to be found the manly sports, combined with the more gentle pastimes. Hurling, foot-ball and bowling are the favorite sports; and the com

batants in these games, again, mingle in the dance with as little feeling of fatigue as though they were after playing a game of croquet. But Ireland at present cannot boast of so much rural amusement as in former days. The hand of the spoiler has been at,work; and it may now be said, with Goldsmith, that “rural mirth and manners are no more.” Her sturdy sons are driven from her shores, to seek that home in foreign lands which oppression has deprived them of in their native country, and though they may carry along with them that love of pleasure and mirth so characteristic of the Irish race, they can never again indulge in sports with the same ardor and gaiety as was their wont "When in their own green Isle.

The National Bridge Hoaa.
SOLD BY THE AMATEURS.
The Southern Cotkgian of March 8, conducted by some amateur young journalists of Washington and Lee University, Lexington, Virginia, has published an account of quite a prodigy at the famous Natural Bridge in Rockbridge County, of which Lexington is the county seat. The account represented that wonderful structure as slowly consuming, the writer suggesting that electricity was the cause, and calling upon Prof. Campbell, of the Lexington University, for an explanation. A note is then subjoined, purporting to come from Pt of. Campbell, and signed by his name, in which he states that large fissures of the limestone of the bridge are filled with a kind of bituminous coal or asphaltum, and gives chemical reasons f >r the combustion. The paper containing the story was sent to us carefully marked some time since, but we as carefull5r ab-tained from noticing it. Several rustic journals of Virginia and ■ Maryland have been burned by the Natural Bridge conflagration, and it is still kept going in the Northern press. Without any discourtesy to the authors of this nonsensical invention, we think that if they would employ themselves in pursuing the studies for which their parents sent them to college they would help the dignity of the new University at Lexington and their own usefulness, more than by manufacturing idle canards, and especially by fabricating the letter of a Professor in their institution, though if he can excuse such a liberty perhaps no one has a right to complain. We fear that when the truth reaches those credulous sensation-mongers of the Northern press who have been taken'in by the hoax there will be some moral reflections on collegiate training in Lexington not altogether of a complimentary kind, accompanied, perhaps, by a hint that the “bridge” is not the only “natural” in that region, with an intimation that the authors of the hoax, in their effort to burn up the bridge, have not proved that they are able to set “the North River1 afire.”—Baltimore Sun.
