Smils Whenever You Can.
When things don’t go to suit you, And the world seems upside down, Don’t waste your time in fretting, But drive away that frown;
Since life is oft perplexing, ’Tis much the wisest plan. -
To bear all trials bravely, And smile whene’er you can.
Why should you dread to-morrow, And thus despoil to-day ?
For when you borrow trouble You always have to pay.
1	It is a good old maxim,
■ Which should be often preached: “ Don’t cross the bridge before you Until the bridge is reached.”
You might be spared much sighing, If you would keep in mind •
The thought that good and evil Are always here combined. ...
There must be something wanting, And though you roll in wealth
You may miss from your casket — .
That precious jewel—health.	—
And though you’re strong and sturdy, You may have an empty purse;
(And earth has many trials Which I consider worse!) ■ But whether joy or sorrow
JFill up your mortal span,	.
’Twill make your pathway brighter To smile whene’er you can. •

Their Arrival at Halifax, N. S.—Interesting Account of their Travels.—Scenes along the Route.
Halifax, N. S., October 6, 1872,
Editor Scholastic : When leaving the quiet retreats of Notre Dame on an extended tour of the world, we promised to keep you well posted, and hence our numerous friends, as to our progress and success.
This is our earliest opportunity of fulfilling that promise and we' therefore eagerly take advantage of it. But time and space will not permit us to lay an extended account of our first voyage before your readers. So we will proceed rapidly on.
Leaving Notre Dame on the 8th of September, a joyous,. happy company of forty, we directed our course to Chicago,
to meet there our steamer, chartered, for us through the kindness of Prof. L .' Arriving in that recently scorched, city, we dispatched Messrs. Keenan and Karst to ascertain if all things were ready for our embarkation.	-
They soon returned, reporting in the affirmative, and before an hour and a half had elapsed we were aboard the Hiawatha, bound for Halifax.
The weather was in every respect propitious, giving us every assurance of a prosperous voyage and a pleasant time generally.
Gliding gaily over the smooth waters of Lake Michigan, we steamed through the Straits of Mackinaw into Lake Huron, taking only a passing glance at Bois Blanc Island, in the distance.	.	-	,t ■:
About this time a gentle gale was blowing from the northwest, causing Huron’s waters to be somewhat agitated, much to the alarm of certain members of the company, who declared they would “ leave off’ at the next stopping place. We kept steadily on however, and passing into St. Clair River, through the lake of the same name, were not long in reaching Detroit. Here we laid in a supply, of wood and provisions and spent sometime in viewing the city, but more especially the work of the tunnel under the river, which is now being hastened forward. Time prevents us from doing justice to this city.	>
We are aboard again, and on the waters of Lake Erie; heading for Buffalo.	'	■
History pictured to our imagination the signal victory of Commodore Perry, achieved on the 10 th of September, 1813, which so much paralyzed the power of Great Britain upon our lakes. •	.
On the morning of the 21st we arrived at Buffalo. Many being anxious to witness the most magnificent cataract in the world, took the cars on the Northern Central Railroad, and after a ride of twenty-two miles came in view of the falls, crossing the suspension bridge, two miles further down.
After partaking of a bountiful repast at the Spencer, and then spending sometime admiring this display of the grandeur of nature, all returned on the evening train; and then partaking of a splendid supper served up by “ mine host ” of the mansion, proceeded to our boat and were soon moving through the Wellepd Canal. A day and a half riding over Ontario braughtus to the St Lawrence. On the evening of the 24th the glimmering lights of Montreal were discernible in the distance. At dusk the following day we passed Quebec, not, however, without a view of its strong fortress—the Gibraltar of America.
After a part of three days had elapsed, Messrs. Gillen and Wallace discovered that our latitude and longitude placed us in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Their calculations

Self-Esteem.
Self-esteem is a general term expressing the value which a man sets upon himself. This value may be just or it may he unjust; that is, it may be in accordance with the real worth of the individual, or it may be either greater-or less than his real worth.
When one’s self-esteem is just, it adds dignity to the man, and places him in a position, so far os individual disposition is concerned, to do the greatest amount of good of which he is capable. Bv this we mean that he is neither so diffident as to fear undertaking anything which he is qualified by nature or training to perform successfully, nor so presumptuous as to undertake that which exceeds his natural or acquired ability.
On the other hand when one’s self-esteem is unjust, it renders the man either cowardly or rash and presumptuous. In the first case, the man with too little self-esteem allows those talents and powers with which nature has endowed him, to waste away in inaction because be fears to bring them into use, and thus he fails to accomplish the good which he was destined to do. In the second case he overtasks his natural powers, by undertaking things above his .'strength, and thus not only neglects that work for winch he is by nature qualified, but also exposes himself to certain failure by undertaking that whicn he is unable to accomplish. This of course is the case only when the man with too great self-esteem actually undertakes something above his-strength.
In the great majority of cases, however, the man who esteems himself above that which is in him, will rather ’waste his time telling what he can do, or what he is going to do, and criticising others wno are quietly doing that which he himself would be utterly incapable of doing even should he undertake it.
It is evident that such persons not only waste the talent or ability which they do possess; but render themselves supremely ridiculous in the eyes of alb who know that their ability does not at aH tally with their boastings, and that their criticism of others is nothing more nor less than arrant-presumption on their part, based upon vanity, not upon sound judgment.
True merit and real ability will make themselves felt rather than heard. If a man possesses abil’ty and uses it - judiciously he will be appreciated, even though he should fail to win that public applause which the world calls fame.. He will be loved and respected by those whom he has benefited, and will be happy in the consciousness that he has dony well the work which the Creator intended
him to do; and any man who seeks more than this is s vain, proud man, and deserves to be disappointed.
But-even should a man, for a time, gain applause greater than he really merits, what does it amount to ? Does it make him a better or more useful man ? No; it only flatters his vandy, and renders him more vain. Will that unmerited applause continue? No; the moment that man has passed away—yes, often before he has passed away—his laclc of solid worth will be discovered and he will be despised by the very ones who helped to sound his praises, just in proportion to the extent to which he imposed upon them by his boastful and arrogant assumption of a merit which he did not possess.
The true man, therefore, should endeavor to know exactly his own ability, and then use that ability to do something 'worthy of commendation. This will secure for him all the applause to which he has any right, and such applause alone is lasting. Any applause beyond that which is really merited, is fickle, vain and perishable, often turning into bitterness to punish the pride of the foolish individual who accepted it as due.
Notes by the Way.
The Prefect of Discipline is but seldom called upon to exercise his authority in an unpleasant manner. We hope his office will yet be a sinecure.
The St. Cecilians have had their room fitted up in grand style, under the direction of Prof. Lyons, and with the aid of Mr. Pine’s artistic skill. Why cannot the other societies do likewise ?
A professional gardener has been engaged to remodel the grounds in front and around the College building in accordance with the plan mentioned last week.
We received some copy this week with so many notices to “ turn over,” that we concluded the writer must have been under the impression that we formerly belonged to a circus—we didn’t, however.
The great majority of our students show a determination to justify the expectations of their parents and friends by earnest attention to their studies and a strict observance of the regulations of the Institution. Tiiis is the best assurance they can give of an ability to fit themselves for honorable and useful positions in life. May they be successful. •
One day last week the Thespians, accompanied by the Rev. Prefect of Discipline and a member of the Faculty, went on an excursion to Mr. Chirhart’s, where they were most hospitably received, and spent the afternoon very pleasantly. After partaking of an excellent repast, at which each one did justice to himself, they returned well pleased and ready for work on the morrow.
Prof, von Weller has commenced his lessons in the general principles of design. One lesson of one hour is given every Friday to all in the Junior Department, and one lesson on every Tuesday to all in the Senior Department who desire to take instructions in the delightful art, and are not otherwise engaged at the time of the lesson. These lessons are given gratis.
The President, Rev. Father Lemonnier, visited some of the classes in company with the Director of Studies during
THE SCHOLASTIC.
SI
thh week. He expressed himself well pleased with the evidences of earnest work which he observed in a1! of the classes which he visited. He intends to continue his visits till he has seen personally all the classes, and satisfied himself that the work done in them is thorough. We think that the classes generally will bear scrutiny.
' Personal.
Mr. T. Ewing of ’68 has been with us since Wednesday. He is looking well and speaks hopefully of his prospects in Chicago.	’
Mr. A. W. Arrington of ’69 spent a few days with us this week. His many friends at Notre Dame were delighted to see him and enjoyed his visit exceedingly. • Mr. Arrington has been in the Government service at Washington since he left Notre Dame.

Useless Treasure.—A. rich nobleman was once showing a friend a great collection of precious stones, whose value was almost beyond counting. There were diamonds, and pearls, and rubies, and gems from almost every country on the globe, which had been gathered by their possessor with the greatest labor and expense. “ And yet,” he remarked, “ they yield me no income.”
His friend replied that he had two stones which cost him about ten florins each, yet they yielded him an income of two hundred florins a year.
In much surprise the nobleman desired to see the wonderful stones; when the manfled him down to his mill, and pointed to the two toiling gray mill-stones. They, were laboriously crushing the grain into snowy flour for the use of hundreds who depended on this work for their daily bread. Those two dull homely stones did more good in the world, and yielded a larger income, than all the nobleman’s jewels. So it is with idle treasure everywhere. It is doing nobody any good. It is right to be prudent and saving of our money when it is for a good, fixed purpose, but to hoard it up for its own sake is more than folly —it is sin.	’	.	.

Mr. Editor: Tn v>ew of the fact that tile Baud has ever been an object of interest at Notre Dame, we feel confident ihat a bi’-et account of its present status wD1. be acceptable to your readers—quorum magnum numemim /tabes, as Caj^ar would say. Be it known, therefore, to all whom it may concern, that our musical—not noisy—fraternity has been reorganized this year under very favo.'a-ble auspices. Although anything akin to boasting is repugnant to our principles, we feel justified in saying iuat in numerical strength and musical ability we will compare favorably with our predecessors, wuo have in years gone by animated the “ quiet halls of our Alma Mater ” with the soul of harmony.
At our first meeting, which was held September 11th, the following officers were elected for the current session:.

A boy retu rned from school one day with a report that h;s scholarship had fallen below the usual average, “Well,” said nis fatuer, “you’ve faPen behind this month,have you?”
“ Yes, sir.”
“ How did that happen?”
“ Don’t know, sir.”
The lather knew, if his son did not. He had observed a number of cheap novels scaiteicd about the house; but he had not thought it worth his while to say anything until a fitting opportunity should offer itself. A basket of apples stood upon the floor, and he said:
“Empty those apples and take the basket and bring it to me half full of ciups.”
Suspecting nothing, the son obeyed.
“Aad now,”he continued, “put those apples back into the basket.”	, - .
When half the appks weie replaced, the son said:
“ Father, they roll oil’. I can’t put in any more.”
“ Put them in; I tell you.”
“ But, father, I ain’t pat them in.”
“Put them hi! No, of couise you can’t put them in. Do you expect to fill a basket half full of chips and then fill it with apples? You said you didn’t know why you fell behind at school, and I will tell you. Your mind is like that basket. It will not hold more than so much. And here you’ve been, the past month, filling it up with uheae diet— cheap novels!”
The boy turned ou his heel, and whistled,' and said, “Whew! I see the point;”
Not a cheap novel has been seen in the house :from that day to this.

The general Drawing and Singing Classes are in full operation. Instructions given daily in the first principles of these arts to all the pupils.
The scene in the sewing circles on Thursday, recalls the following lines:
“ The bright little needle, the swift little needle The needle directed by beauty and art.”

What is the difference between the death of a barber and a sculptor ?
One curls and dies; the other makes faces and busts.
An Optical Curiosity.—Here is a simple little experiment by which we can prove the existence of a blind spot in our eyes. Shut your left eye, and with the right one look steadily at the cross just below, holding the paper ten or twelve inches from the eye.
►£.	O
Now move the paper slowly toward the eye, which must be kept fixed on the cross. At a certain dstance the other figure, the letter 0 will' suddenly disappear; but if you bring the paper nearer, it will come again into view. You may not succeed in the experiment on the first trial, but with a little patience you can hardly fail, and the suddenness with which the black spot vanishes and reappears, is very striking. Now, examination has shown that when it disappears, its image falls exactly on the spot where the optic nerve enters the eye, thus proving that spot to be blind.	.
Advertise in The Scholastic.
We have concluded to take a limited number of choice advertisements this year, should our business friends conclude to patronize us in this department.
This arrangement, however, will not interfere with the reading matter, as we propose printing the advertisements on a separate sheet, to serve as a cover to the present Scholastic. This will be done as soon as a sufficient number of advertisements are secured.
