St. Mary’s, June 2, 1869.
The Feast of Corpus Christi was celebrated with great devotion by the pupils, particularly by those whose happy privilege it was to receive on that holy feast their First Communion. These privileged children had been in retreat during the three days preceding the festival, and their young hearts were well prepared to partake of the Celestial Banquet.
The names of the First Communicants are as follows: Misses Rose Leoni, L. and M. McNamara, L. Blaizy, A. Byrns, N. Gross, L. Jones, L. A. McKinny M. Mark; These occupied seats in the sanctuary during the celebration of the Mass, aad seemed deeply impressed with the act they were about to perform.
After a most touching address from our Chaplain, Rev. Father Letourneau, they approached, with great awe, modesty, and humility, the Holy Table. A suitable time having been devoted to thanksgiving, the happy group withdrew to the dining-room where they breakfasted in company with our Rev. Chaplain and other guests.
The day was then given to a joyful interchange of congratulations until Vesper time, when all again assembled in the chapel to assist at the Divine Office and witness the reception of several young ladies into the Society of the “Children of Mary.”
Thus closed this happy festival, leaving a holy impression on every heart, and a most consoling picture on which memory loves to dwell.
