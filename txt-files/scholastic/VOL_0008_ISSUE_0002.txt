Voices of the Dead.
A few snow-patches on the mountain-side,
A few white foam-flakes from the ebbing tide, A few remembered words of malice spent, The record of some dead man’s ill intent,—
They cannot hurt us, all their sting is gone, Their hour of cold and bitterness is done;
Yet deepest snows and fiercest lashing seas Bring not such cold or bitter thoughts as these.
A few soiled lilies dropped by childish hands, A few dried orange-blooms from distant lands, A few remembered smiles of some lost friend, Few words of love some dear dead fingers penned,—
They are not beautiful for love to see, And death’s pale presence seems in them to be;
Yet never living blooms, most fresh and gay, Fill us with thoughts of love so sweet as they.
—London Spectator.
We insert with pleasure the following, from the pen of an esteemed lady friend, and we hope it will not be the’last time that our columns will receive the aid of so welcome an auxiliary.
Backbiting.
T'
FROM THE GERMAN.
. There was once an old man named Cribble Grabble who always tried to make the best of everything.
One day while he was sitting by himself and looking through his microscope at a drop of water taken from a stagnant pool, he suddenly exclaimed, “ How they wiggle! ” For the little animals in the drop of water jumped and sprang here and there, pulling and biting and cutting one another in a dreadful way.
“Now this is perfectly horrible,” said old Cribble Grabble; “why doesn’t somebody compel them to live in peace and quiet, and make each one mind his own business?”
He thought over the matter for a long time, and finally said, “ I’ll give them color, so that I may see them more easily.” And then he took a little drop of wine and mixed it with the water, when at once those curious little animals became pink, and looked for all the world like an army of painted savages.
“What the mischief are you at?” said an old neighbor who came in at that moment.
“If you can guess what it is,” said Cribble Grabble, “I’ll give it to you.”
“ But may be it isn’t so easy to guess,” said the old neigh-i bor; “but I can try.”
And then he looked through the microscope, when it. seemed indeed as if all the people of a city were running around half-naked and crazy. That was bad enough;. but it was still more horrible to see how the venomous little creatures knocked and pushed each other, how they pulled, and grabbed and bit and struck at one another.
What was on top had to come down, and what was on the bottom had to come up. “Look, look! ” cried one, in a seeming rage, “his leg is longer than mine!" Uph! and. off it came.
There was another who had a little lump behind his ear; a trifling little lump; but it hurt him, and therefore they, would make it hurt him still more,—so they pulled him,-bit him, teased him, and at last eat him up altogether, all^ because of that little lump!	V‘
■ Then there was one sitting demurely by herself, as quiet x and still as a little maid,—but she must come out. So they dragged her out and then pushed her, pulled her, bit her, and finally eat her up also.
“ Strange enough! ” said the old neighbor.
■ “But what does it mean?” said Cribble Grabble; “can you guess what it is? ”
“ Well, I don’t know that it is so hard to guess after all,” said the neighbor. It is a town, a city of backbiters, detractors and scandalmongers,—Niles, South Bend, or some other; they are all alike.”
“Not a bit of it! ” said Cribble Grabble. It is a drop of
water out of that pool.’

Sketch of Cardinal Cheverus
The N. Y. Herald publishes the following interesting sketch of Cardinal Cheverus, the first Bishop of Boston: ‘
Jean Louis Charles Cheverus was bom in Mayence, in. 1768. He was of noble family, and in early life was set apart for the Church. He received his classical education at the College of Louis le Grand, and his theological training at the Seminary of St. Magloire. He was ordained, priest at the last public ordination in Paris before the French Revolution, and was advanced to a benefice in his native city by Monsieur afterwards Louis XVHI. He had not long resided in Mayence when the persecution of the . clergy commenced. He repaired to Paris, where he was concealed on the 2d and 3d of September—days made memorable by the massacre of ecclesiastics. After this sanguinary scene he made his escape to England. On arriving in Dover he could not speak a word of the language of the country, but in January, 1793, he took up his residence in the house of a Protestant clergyman, who, in addition to his pastoral duties, was preparing five or six young men for university. Dr. Cheverus was employed in giving these
I

scholars lessons in the languages and mathematics, and found in the conversation of his pupils the best instruction in the English tongue. In 1795 he was invited by Right Rev. Dr. Matignole, with whom he was slightly acquainted in Paris, to join him in Boston, where he landed in October, 1796. The Catholics were increasing at this time in Boston, and by the well directed efforts of Dr. Cheverus he gathered numerous new adherents,—while his affable, simple and winning manners, his eloquence and inexhaustible benevolence, made him exceedingly popular with other religious denominations. From Boston he went to Newcastle, Maine, where he founded a church and spent three months in missionaiy labor among the Indians on the Penobscot River and in the vicinity of Passamaquoddy Bay. He was recalled to Boston, where yellow fever was raging, and gave renewed evidence of courage, devotion and benevolence, which extended to all persons, without distinction of creed. When he opened a subscription in 1802 io build a church, he found liberal assistance from Protestants, including President John Adams, who headed the list with a considerable subscription.
Dr. Cheverus continued to visit the Penobscot Indians, who are to this day devout Catholics.- His labors among the people of Boston were unremitting, and productive of great benefits. In 1810 he was appointed the first Bishop of that city. His literary and scientific acquirements were of the highest order. He read Greek and Hebrew with wonderful facility, and wrote Latin as a vernacular tongue. He repeatedly declared that if he were to make an argument for his life he should prefer, before competent judges, to use Latin, believing that his thoughts would flow more readily in that-language than in either French or English. Dr. Cheverus was a good citizen of his adopted country, and never lost an opportunity of teaching his flock the blessings flowing from the Government under which they lived, and kept alive in their hearts a warm and constant patriotism.
In the war of 1812, as stated above, when Boston was threatened with an attack by the English fleet, and voluntary contributions of labor became necessary for making arrangements for proper defence, the Bishop several times went out to work at the head of his flock in building ramparts. He was a minister of peace, but instructed his flock that self-defence was not only a law of nature but a principle of religion. Dr. Cheverus’ health began to give way in 1822, and the Baron de Neuville, who had been residing in the United States as Minister of France, on his return to that country reported the fact to Louis XVIII, and his (the Bishop’s) talents being well known, tue king nominated him to the Pope to be Bishop of Montauban. The Holy Father consented to his translation from Boston, and on September 231 he embarked for Havre on the ship Paris. The vessel was wrecked a month later, during a violent tempest, off the coast of France, and thus after an absence of thirty years Dr. Cheverus was thrown on his native shores, where the highest honors awaited him. Three years later he was appointed Archbishop of Bordeaux and created a peer of France.
The National Assembly, after the revolution of 1830, declared that all peers created by Charles X were no longer entitled to hold that rank, and the Archbishop at once published the following statement: “ Without approving of the exclusion provided against the peers named by Charles X, I am rejoiced to find my political career at an
end, and I have taken a firm resolution not again to reconsider it, by accepting of any- place or office. I desire to remain in the middle of my flock and to continue to practise as a minister of charity, of mercy and of peace. I preach submission to the Government. I set the example, and shall continue to do so, and my clergy and myself pray with our flock for the prosperity of our dear country. I am more and more attached to the inhabitants of Bordeaux. I am thankful for the friendship they express towards me. The wish of my heart is to live and die in the midst of them, but without other titles than that of their Archbishop and their friend.”
When Louis Philippe became king of France he requested Dr. Cheverus to receive back the dignity of peer, but the proposal was firmly but respectfully declined. The known piety, learning, benevolence and dignity of the prelate directed the eyes of the nation towards him as being worthy of the loftiest honors of the Church of which he was a brilliant light. His career in the United States was the subject of eulogium in every circle. Cholera raged in Bordeaux, and the people were led to think that the watershad been poisoned. The presence and words of the Archbishop allayed the fears that prevailed. In February, 1836, Dr. Cheverus was created a Cardinal, but he died in July following, at the age of sixty-eight years, having held the office only six months. It was the general belief that had he survived until a vacancy occurred in the Papal chair he would have been chosen as the successor of the then Pope.

Ths General at a Girons.
*
Sitting in front of us was General Sherman and with him quite a number of children whom he had gathered up from the “ by-ways and hedges.” We saw him look down under the seat, and then haul out a dirty, ragged little darkey, who had crept in under the tent, and then seat him at his feet, where, by crowding, was made a place for the little rascal. “Now,” said the General, “sit there, my boy, and see everything. Bless me 1 many is the time I’ve done just the same thing, and many a thrashing have I had.” He seemed like a child; everything pleased him, and we wondered where was the vanity of which people talked so loudly. Who has a better right to be vain than Sherman; vain of his valor, vain of his deeds, vain of his wife, vain of his children, and vain of the love of his countrypeople ? When he went to Europe he did not go via Loudon, but took the far-off countries of the East, aud made London the tail-end rather than head of his journey. Why? “Because,” to use his words as nearly as we can, “I bad never been to Europe, and if I had gone to London I’d found myself at entertainments pretty ignorant from want of observation of their part of the world. So I did it all up at the other end, and knew as much as any fellow when I got to London.”— From a Washington Letter.
The Abbe Gerrard, for forty years cure of the parish ofCorbeil, has just died, after an exemplary life, wherein he gave really all that he had—and it was much—to the poor. Shortly before expiring he directed all the “ promises to pay,” which he held for 60,090f. to be brought to him, and next to be burned in his presence.—Ex.

.. Our Bow.
It is with the greatest diffidence we seat ourselves in the Editorial chair of the Scholastic. We Know full well that the position of Editor of a college paper is not to he coveted, for it is next to impossible to please every reader. There are some persons who think that a paper like the Scholastic should be made up of good solid reading; others there are who wish for a lighter and more humorous style of articles, while a third class desire that it be ciammed with plenty of local news. What pleases one does not please another, and if the Editors try to write for all, they may succeed in satisfying none. Such being the case, we take our seat, as we have said, with reluctance, and heartily wish that the burden had been placed upon the shoulders of others better able to bear it than we are. However, believing that the paper should be made up of serious articles as well as humorous, and that local items should also figure prominently in the pages of the paper, we shall do the best we can, and if our friendswill assist us with good contributions We’ may hope to give satisfaction to the majority of our readers. But be it known that we are ever ready and more than willing to abdicate our chair in favor of any one who may be thought better fitted to fill it.
; And be it further known that if any one has any complaints to make regarding the merits of the articles inserted in.any issue of the Scholastic, we will be very thankful to him if he will send us something better for the succeeding number.

Rev. Father Lemonnier is dangerously ill, and we are Sony to say that little hope is entertained of his recovery. He requests the prayers of his friendsth.it God’s holy will may be accomplished in him.
How to Become a Good. Student.
■ Begin by acquiring the habit of study; or in other words separate yourself from all that could distract you, and apply yourself seriously to the work you have taken in hand. This is absolutely necessary; unless you are heartily interested in your work, success, in any degree, is out of the question. Many who come to college actually spend half of the year in ruminating on the pleasures of the past vacation, and the other half in laying plans for the next; they are at college bodily, but in spirit they are far away.
/This is the class of students who are forever counting the days before Christmas or Commencement, and can always tell you on what day of the week an extra recreation will
come. These drones lead the most miserable, aimless lives that can be imagined; and when they leave college, or are sent away, it is only to become worthless members of society.
Industry and perseverance are the first requisites for success in study as well as in everything else; and it should be the first care of the student to form habits of these virtues, which will crown his studies with success and be the best guarantees for future prosperity. Nothing can be gained in life without labor; and the student who imagines he will ever become a learned man without real, hard, earnest study of course deceives himself.
Perseverance, too, is not less necessary7. It is not sufficient to have begun well: the same persevering effort must be continued to the end. The student when entering college should leave to those more experienced and enlightened than himself the direction of his studies, and should-never quit those he has once taken up. The indiscriminate studying of one thing to day and another tomorrow is one of the worst habits a student can form, and has filled the world with half-educated men. It always betrays a fickle disposition; and it is as trite as it is true, that a rolling-stone gathers no moss.
It should be the earnest endeavor of every student to make the best possible use of every moment of time; • and to accomplish this, nothing, is more important than order, in its distribution, allowing to each study the amount it requires. No affair, however important it may seem to be, should be allowed to encroach upon the hours reserved for study; if this inclination is once yielded to, it is next to impossible to correct it, and the occasions, for postponing or omitting a class or other duty will increase in proportion as the habit grows oh us.
Everything has its proper time. The hours of recreation are necessary to afford the mind as well as the body the relaxation nquired. The bow that is always bent is sure to break, and experience amply proves that those who study during free time, have lost by it in the end.
Many students who have a just appreciation of time and money study only those branches which they foresee will be of most service io them in future; their wisdom is to be commended, but it is to be regretted that so many others entirely lose sight of this, and after years spent at college are neither fitted for a commercial nor. professional life. The fault, however, is invariably their own, and arises from a want of system in study.
Most young m*. n who enter college expect to accomplish everything in a shortir lime than that marked out. That which ordinarily requires five or six years they hope to accomplish in three or four at most, and it would be useless to attempt to convince them of the folly of such an undertaking. “Next to the demon, ” said one of our former professors, with his usual earnestness, “ there is nothing I hate so much as this over-eagerness, which is beyond all others the fault of American students.” Festina lente. To commence at the beginning, and pass through in regular order each class, is the only way to obtain a thorough and solid education; and if this be wanting, nothing can supply its place. Wealth and position may command a servile re-' spect while they last, but learning and culture are always and everywhere honored. ' ’	•
Our new church will be ready for the celebration of Holy Mass about Christmas. It is being frescoed. .

Notice.
• All mail matter intended for persons residing at Notre Dame should be addressed simply to “ Notre Dame, Ind/’ Many mistakes have occurred, and daily do occur, in consequence of addressing letters, etc., to “ Notre Dame University,” or to “South Bend,” or “Notre Dame, near South Bend.” Remember, then, the proper address is simply “Notre Dame, Ind.,” as it is by that our post office .is known.
To Contributors.
Our columns are open to all. But remember—write legibly and only on one side of the sheet, avoid personality, and be sparing of your adjectives. Every article should be' signed with the author’s name—and if it is not to be printed, may be written with a line through it. Direct all communications to “ The Scholastic.” There is a box in the main hall of the College, near the Seniors’ study-hall;
The scholastic year has opened most auspiciously. Notwithstanding the hard times, we have a large number of students, and the cry is: “Still they come.” But a few weeks ago all was silent, and the occasional visitor might hear his footsteps echo through the all but deserted halls of Notre Dame. Now the scene is changed. The tramp of busy feet is heard from early morn till the shades of evening invite the student to his well-earned repose.
Since the opening of the session we have had the happiness of welcoming many old friends, and making the acquaintance of many new ones who, we hope, will enjoy their stay amongst us. But we miss the many who have left their Alma Mater to enter upon the great battle of life; May success be theirs. We are with them in spirit, and nothing gives us greater pleasure and consolation than to hear that those who were once under our care have become useful and worthy members of society.
. The routine of college life has fairly commenced; and another year, with its clouds and sunshine, is before us-With the exception of Rev. Father Colovin, who is now Vice-President and Director of Studies, our College officers are the same as last year. Each course of studies is well attended, and we are glad to see that our students are in earnest and seem determined to profit by the advantages which they enjoy; and it cannot but be a source of pleasure to parents to know that the efforts they make to procure an education for their sons will be repaid by their future usefulness.
Everything promises a happy and prosperous year, and with the blessing of Heaven we hope that it may be one we may look back upon in after years as among those which were well spent.
Geography on a Small Scale.
We have made our county map the object of special study lately, with somewhat alarming results. We find that the olive does not flourish in Olive township, nor did Warren perish at the battle of Bunker Hill. German is not particularly Teutonic, and Clay consists entirely of sand. Harris is not addicted to harassing her neighbors, and we wish we could believe that Penn always did write. Portage, alas 1 [
is not celebrated for the age of her port, and Centre is not in the middle. Greene is the one that sets bounds to our liberty; nor can the warmest admirers of a late lamented President deny that Lincoln has deprived us of a large share of that same Liberty, while a very slight glance at the county map will convince him that Liberty and Union are not one and inseparable. Finally, there is no insane asylum in Madison, as there should be, were it only to confine the man that named the Townships in.
Local Items.
A boat-race on the 13th is talked of. 300 is the number of students thus far. Bro. Bonaventure’s parterre looks well. Mr. Zahm is making an addition to his Laboratory. The sanitary condition of Notre Dame is very good. The Circulating Library is now open to the students. The Classes of Chemistry are larger than ever before. A new clock will soon grace the steeple of the church. The towers of the old church are among the things that were.
Mr. Gillespie is named leader of the Band. We may expect good music.
Work on Father General’s new house still continues— and keeps on continuing. "
Our acolyte's are re-uniting. Their old Director has kindly taken charge of them. •
Mr. Gregori is to paint' the pretty chapel at the Scho--lasticate. It ought to be shingled first.
The big bell has been moved -to a more elevated position in the new church; it is getting high-toned in consequence.
Father Colovin made a very appropriate little speech to the Seniors the other night. We accidentally heard just a portion of it.
The Retreat of the priests of the diocese will take place at Notre Dame about the 19th of the month. B.shop D wenger will preach it.
The Apprentice’s House is in capital order. The handsome little chapel is much improved by the new-illuminated windows which were bought for it in France last summer.
We are informed by the Rednecks, of Lowell, that their challenge to the Clippers expired by limitation on Thursday, and the latter have forfeited the game, 9 to 0.— South Bend Tribune.
The Michigan Central Ticket Agent for Notre Dame and St. Mary’s has bis headquarters in the Students’ Office, where tickets to all points on the M. C. R. R. and its connections East and West can be procured.
The study-hall of the Classical students is to be changed to the front of the building, where the class-rooms of Profs. Tong and Howard used to be. The old study-hall will be used as a class-room for the Book-Keeping Classes.
On the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross a beautiful life-sized crucifix was solemnly blessed and erected on the mound between the Scholasticate and the Professed House. Rev. Fr. Cooney preached a stirring sermon on the occasion. ~
