St. Edward’s Day.
The festival of St. Edward, the patronal feast of our Very Rev. Superior General, Father Sorin, was celebrated this year with that sincere pleasure which has for many years characterized St Edward’s Day at Notre Dame.
The’ universal reverence and esteem entertained at Notre Dame for its venerable founder is a sufficient guarantee that.each one concerned in the entertainment did his utmost to render it pleasing and successful. Hence we need not stop to describe the earnestness with which all set themselves to the work of preparation, but come at once to the entertainment itself.	■
Promptly at seven o’clock on the evening of the 12th, all the young gentlemen destined to execute the pro’ gramme published in The Scholastic last week were in their proper places. The audience, composed of the Students, the Faculty, the. Community, and a large number of friends who had come to add by their presence to the pleasures of the evening, were comfortably seated, when the Very Rev. Father General, the guest' of the evening, entered, accompanied by the Very Rev.’ Father Provincial and the Rev. President of the University.
Their entrance was the signal for the opening march by the Band, which astonished all present by the correctness and beauty of their playing, notwithstanding the-short time which they had had for preparation. The Orchestra followed, as announced in the programme, and, while giving pleasure to all, fully justified their reputation for musical ability.	-
Then followed the addresses, some of which we give below, regretting that the size of our little paper will not justify us in reproducing all:	• • ■

ADDRESS FROM THE SENIOR DEPARTMENT. -	— b- ■
Very Sen. Father General;	/ , 3— • ? i -	•
One thing, since time began, One thing alone is sought by man: ’Tis, to be happy if he can.
But this, in grief or health, But this, in poverty or wealth, • But this he seeks, in work or stealth. •
In bondage or in power,-When fortunes smile, or when they lower, This craving fills up every hour.
Alike in peace or war, • By sea or land, by flood or fire, -We still pursue our grand desire.
And so, in wealth, power, fame, Or aught of high or lowly name, ’ ’Tis happiness is still our aim;
Our object ever this: •	• •
By paths where good or evil is, -To reach the topmost hights of bliss.
Right well, then, may we ask, How we shall compass our high task,-And in this calm, bright sunshine bask !
A thousand answers rise, -
Each glistening before our eyes -With promises of what we prize.

, First Gold, with all his glare, At which all sordid natures stare, And ’fore their lord-base foreheads bare.
But gold, as hath the poet told,
. Is good to purchase only gold:	. .
Not happiness is bought and sold. '
%
And next comes noisy Fame But what avails an empty name, A voice, and nothing to proclaim ?
Then Pleasure lifts her head:
Full sweet she blooms,—quick pines, is dead; Weak self, her glory soon has fled!
And brazen Power strides forth, ‘Thundering his mandates o’er the earth, Whereat she trembles, south to north'.
He fills all hearts with fear, But to his own he gives no cheer; For loveless power is cold and drear.
How, then, win happiness ?
What fount of joy shall ever bless, Shall ever soothe the soul’s distress ?
What charms shall we employ, To give our hearts that steadfast joy Which life nor death can e’er destroy ?
One charm alone is given
_ That we may snatch this bliss of heaven, For which all men have ever striven.
’Tis to live as Heaven designed, Pure of body, pure of mind, In love of God and humankind,—
The bliss of brotherhood, The happiness of doing good, The joy of living as we should.
When Pleasure furls her sail, When Wealth, Fame, Power no more avail, This source of joy will never fail.
Thus have you had true cheer, True peace and joy, this many a year, Thus happy lived, our Father dear.
Nor did He speak untrue, , Who said: Behold, this one thing do, And all the rest is added too.
For, lo! Earth’s goods are yours, • And fame that to all time endures, And power that all you’ve done secures.
Thus generous Heaven gives
•The meed for which the worldling lives, With that for which the saintly strives.
One gift yet more we pray, That Heaven will spare those locks now gray, And your life prolong to the utmost day.
Till minds are formed and taught, And all the good your hands have wrought To full perfection shall be brought.
And then, when Earth’s is done, Be Heaven’s more perfect joy begun, Made bright by Heaven’s eternal Sun.
The French Address, which by some oversight of the printer was omitted in the programme, was nicely read,by Master A. Schiffer, who, though considerably embarrassed, it being his first appearance in public, showed a great deal of self-possession. The German Address, by Mr. J. Eisenman, elicited much commendation, while that from the Minims excited a great deal of laughter by its pointed hits and funny expressions.
Prof. Howard’s Address on behalf of the Faculty was just what we expected it would be—earnest in expression, choice in language, just in its praises, and free from anything like flattery. We regret that we have not a copy for publication, but it was not written, and we are unable to reproduce it as it was spoken.
After the addresses, which were agreeably relieved by choice music, the Thespians brought forward their part of the programme, and certainly did credit to themselves while giving great pleasure to all. It would be difficult to particularize where all did so well, and as our report is already long, considering our small space, we shall be obliged to abstain from special remarks for the’present at least. However, we must say here that all of the young gentlemen engaged in the play deserve the thanks of all for the pleasure they afforded.
The entertainment closed a quarter before ten, and Very Rev. Father General, in response to the addresses presented to him, thanked the young gentlemen with that fulness of sincerity which always repays an effort to do well. He commended the Thespians for the manner in which they had acquitted themselves, and thanked them also for the pleasure they had afforded. He spoke of the present prosperity of Notre Dame, and of the encouraging prospects for the future. He evidently felt satisfied and hopeful, and caused every one present to share his sentiments. May the future justify his present bright anticipations, and may he, the founder, long live to see the abundant fruit of his early labors and sacrifices.

The Bridge of Sighs.
The Bridge of Sighs connects the palace with the public prison. The latter was erected in 1589, and the bridge in 1591. A single arch supports the structure, which connects the second story of the palace with the second story of the prison. It is simply a corridor divided by a partition into two narrow halls, through one of which political prisoners were conducted to imprisonment, while the common criminals passed through the other. Externally the Bridge of Sighs has no particular architectural merit. It has acquired a gloomy notoriety from its name, and from the prevailing impression that the man who traversed it from the palace to the dungeon never returned. This is in part romance, but for the significant reason that this palace, unrivalled in its elegance, contained gloomier dungeons witbin its glittering walls than the other prison could parallel. The dungeons for political and criminal prisoners awaiting execution—for this distinction is represented in the very architecture of the palace—were quite near the entrance to the Bridge of Sighs. There are two tiers of these dungeons, one above the other, consisting of ten each, with a floor between, constructed of heavy stone masonry. Those for criminals were above, and those for political offenders were below. They are arranged in blocks, being end to end. A narrow, unlighted hall passes around three sides, the dungeons being entered through a low arched opening from the two halls opposite each other. After passing through this opening with a torch to light the chamber, the visitor finds himself in a room enclosed by massive stone walls, twelve feet long, eight feet wide, and eight or nine feet high, with an arched ceiling. The floors are of cement, hardened into stone, and bare of all furniture save a stone pillow set in the floor. Every dungeon repeats the cool, inhuman mockery of a pretended regard for the necessities of the prisoners. A common paving-stone, two feet long, fifteen inches above the floor, was the pillow offered by the State, in the dark days of the Venetian aristocracy, to political as well as criminal offenders. Two Doges, at least—Marino Faliero, in his eightieth year, and Antonio Foscari—were brought to the bitter experience both of the dungeon and of the stone pillow. At the side of the door there is a small round opening through the wall for the introduction of food. The only light was through this opening, and from a small exterior window at the end of another short and narrow hall, which intersected those around the dungeons at one angle. The darkness was substantially total. In this short hall the prisoners were executed at midnight—the political by beheading, and the criminal by strangulation. On the left, and in front of the Bridge of Sighs, is the water portal of the palace. A double doorway, each barred with bronze doors, gives admission to a broad hall which passes through to the palace court. It was at this gate that the Doge embarked in the Bucentaur, when he went forth in state to the annual ceremony of wedding, with a ring, the Adriatic.—Catholic Reflector.
A shabbily dressed genius being treated disrespectfully; by strangers, was asked why he didn’t resent it. “It was: my rusty old hat and coat that were slighted, and not myself,” he replied. “ If they choose to take it up and make a fuss about it they may, but I shall have nothing to do with it.”
Reading the Papers.
The American people are, indeed, a reading people, otherwise the thousands of papers and periodicals issued from the American press would soon die for want of support.
Reading has become a passion with us (I mean us Americans) and like all other passions over-indulged it naturally diminishes that delicacy of taste which would otherwise prompt us to be choice in our selection of readingmatter.
In fact the reading passion has obtained such control over us that we no longer stop to inquire whether the book or paper which we are perusing does or does not contain proper food for the mind; all we seem to crave for is “ something to read.”
In this state of affairs we eagerly grasp at anything in print, as an old toper who may once have been very particular about the quality of his liquor, but who now, from force of habit and a growing desire for stimulants, swallows the vilest stuff that may be offered him. And as the manufacturers of stimulating drinks take advantage of the general carelessness about quality, to palm off their adulterated and poisonous liquors, for good wine, brandy, etc., so also the manufacturers of popular literature take advantage of the cravings of the people for reading-matter, to furnish them a cheap, useless, and often corrupting supply of trash with the high-sounding title of “ Literature for the million,” “Reading-matter for the people,” and other such.
This is true especially of a certain class of papers, whose object it would seem to be to enervate the mind to such a degree that it will crave for food, and at the same time be incapable of feeding on anything more solid or wholesome than this sickly and even poisonous stuff. We refer, of course, to that class of papers whose principal matter consists of nonsensical love stories, rendered still more sickening by a profusion of overdrawn illustrations, which only serve to fill the mind with unreal fancies, and render it useless.
Young men, beware of such reading! shun it as you would a deadly enemy! It can, at best, only please the imagination for a time, while it withdraws the higher faculties of the mind from serious thought, thus debilitating the mind itself It wastes your precious time and prevents you from fitting yourselves as you should for a life of usefulness.
Spondoolics.
A young hopeful at one of our leading Colleges wrote a a letter home, requesting his father to send him some “stamps;” the kind father responded at once, and enclosed a good supply of postage stamps. Hopeful wrote a second letter, stating that he did not want postage stamps —what he wanted was “ spondoolics.” The father, fearing to make another mistake, wrote to the President of the College thus: “ My son wishes me to send him some spondoolics; I do not find any for sale in this place, and would be obliged to you if you would supply him, provided you have any of the article on hand, and charge to my account.” The President gave the boy an order on the treasurer for some pocket money.

In Meznoriam.
The sudden death of Mother Mary of St. Eusebia, second assistant superior of the Sisters of the Holy Cross, and Prefect of Studies, has created deep feelings of profound sorrow. She was, indeed, taken from us in the midst of her usefulness, for she. fulfilled her ordinary duties to within thirty-six hours of her death with her characteristic energy and fidelity.
The faithful, conscientious, efficient manner in which she discharged the responsible duties of Prefect of Religion and Studies had won for her the confidence, esteem and affection of all these over whom she was placed.
Her funeral, on the 10th, at 9, a. m. was attended by all the pupils; the Children of Mary and the members of,the Rosary Society had also assisted at the Community Mass at six o’clock and approached the Holy Communion, thus giving the most edifying proof of their loving, grateful remembrance.
Her former pupils now love to recall the lessons of piety and wisdom she has often given them and affectionately linger over the beautiful memories that cluster around their association wjth the dear departed one.
The few last days previous to her illness were devoted to the religious duties belonging to her office as the Festival of the. “Holy Rosary” the first Sunday in October, was to be prepared for and celebrated by the members of that Confraternity. Thus she unknowingly made a most fervent, special preparation for death. She was heard to remark that she was thankful for having such an opportunity for spending several hours before the Blessed Sacrament as it gave her time to make the special preparation for death, that (according to the rule) is to be made on the first Sunday of every month. These are, indeed, precious memories for those who love her. May her soul rest in peace.	1

A tender-hearted omnibus driver on the Fifth Avenue line says he hates to run over a person; he thinks it hurts the springs.
A parsimonious merchant, at a fashionable dinner the other day, astonished the company, on the appearance of the fifth course, laying down his knife and fork and exclaiming, “ See here; I'll take the rest of this dinner out in money 1”
“Now, John, suppose there’s a load of hay one side of a river and a jackass on the other side, and no bridge, and the river’s too wide to swim, how can the jackass get to the hay?” “I give it up.” “Well, that’s just what the other jackass did.” '
Advertise in The Scholastic.
We have concluded to take a limited number of choice advertisements this year, should our business friends conclude to patronize us in this department.
This arrangement, however, will" not interfere with the reading matter, as we propose printing the advertisements on a separate sheet, to serve as a cover to the present Scholastic. This will be done as soon as a sufficient number of advertisements are secured.
