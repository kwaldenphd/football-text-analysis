The Notes of the Sxaniiiiation.
We give below the notes deserved at the examination by the the students of the Senior Department. The notes of the Juniors are crowded out this week, but will appear in our next number
As an explanation of the notes we should prq-. mise, for the sake of those who have not read our paper lately, that we have followed at the last examination a plan entirely different from that adopted in former years. In order the better to find out the real proficiency of the students, and award to each a note which could be impartially regarded and accepted as a truthful statement of the student’s merit, it was decided by the Faculty that 10 should be the number of questions which each student should have to answer in each of bis classes. Should these 10 questions be rightly answered, the number 100 would be awarded as the note. Should only 9, or 8, or 7 of the questions be perfectly answered, the numbers 90, 80, 70, would respectively correspond to the ques--tions, and.be awarded as their note.
The same system of notes was used in the correction of the compositions which preceded the oral examination, and the two notes in the classes where both the oral and the written examinations were sustained, are found rewarded in the following list, the note for the oral examination being placed before that of the written.
We do not hesitate tosaytbat in some cases the notes do not fairly give an idea of the student’s learning. Whether from bashfulness or embarrassment, or the neglect of refreshing anew the memory on certain matters confidently looked upon, some have comparatively failed injthe matters with which they thought themselves to be the most familiar, and have not done justice to themselves.
The same ill success has befallen others in their written examination. The confusion of a
subject with' another, the inaccuracy or impropriety, or even obscurity of the answers proving the stumbling block of those who studied too supeificiaiiy or hastily the matters on which their their ability was tested.
We trust that those to whom the foregoing remark applies, who have been harshly treated against their best anticipations, by the impartial verdict of the examination, will in future endeavor to master thoroughly the branches on which they have to be examined, and not study certain parts of a book in preference to others which they regard as of trifling importance till they see too late the mistake they made.

172	THE SCHOLASTIC YEAR.
Classes for the Second Session.
The Examination having closed the studies of the past session, and ranked anew the students higher or lower in the series of Classes for the 2d session, we have recorded here the changes which have taken place.
CLASSICAL COUHSE.
Moral Philosophy.—The Oral examination of this Class has been postponed till June, when the members of the Graduating Class will be examined by a Special Board. _ Rev. M. B. Brown, S.S.C., Professor.
First Lati'K—This Class, having finished the regular Latin Course of the Catalogue will, nevertheless continue to write Latin compositions in prose and poetry. A Latin composition will be required from each member of the Class at the June Examination. J. A. Lyons, A.M., Professor.
Second Latin.—A numerous and excellent Class, bidding fair for the Graduation Class of 1869-70. J. A. Lyons, Professor.
Third Latin.—No change in this Class, which is also well attended, and animated with the right spirit. J. A. Lyons, Professor.
Fourth Latin.—Composed of students who have progressed rapidly; has begun with the new session the translation of- the JEneid. M. A. J. Baasen, A. M., Professor.
Fifth Latin.—The 5th Latin continues to use Caesar for translation, and will probably take up Virgil’s Eclogues before the end of the session. It is a large class of intelligent youths. Messrs. Costello and Shanahan are promoted to the 4th. Jacob Lauth, S. S. C., Professor.
Sixth Latin.—Will use Csesar for its translations. This Class is also well deserving for its good training. J. McNulty, S. S. C., Professor.
Seventh Latin.—This Class will begin the translation of Historia Sacra. It has done well considering the limited time since it began, and the difficulties which beginners have to overcome. J. A. O’Connell, 8. S. C., Professor.
Seventh Latin, 2d Div.—A new Class, j ust formed, and composed of Messrs. M. Hackett, R. L. Akin, C. Stuart, H. O’Neill, J. Mulhall, E. Reeves, H. Hayes, J. M. Gearin, C. Menaugh, L. Hayes, G. McCartney, R. V. Coddington, F. Bulger, T. Dillon. F. X. Derrick, S. S. C., Professor.

SCIENTIFIC COUllSE.
Mental Philosophy.—The Class remains unchanged. Rev. M. B. Brown, Professor.
Logic.—A new Class begins with the session.
First Rhetoric.—The course is continued this session, being the third which the class enters. Special studies and exercises in composition, criticisms, and analysis of speeches, orations, etc., will be the object of the class. Blair’s Lectures on Rhetoric will be used as a reference book. T. E. Howard, A. M., Professor. •
Second Rhetoric.—This session is the second of the course. Some new names have been added to the list of the class: I. Buddeke, J. Staley, J. P Kane.

discontinued. New classes have been, formed A. J. Stace, A. M., Professor.
Trigonometry. First Geometry.—The members of the latter class having attended Trigonometry during the past session, will discontinue and study Analytical Geometry. A. J. Stace, Professor.	'
Second Geometry.—Has undergone no change, except that it becomes the 1st. Bro. Joseph,' S. S. C., Professor.
Third Geometry.—No change. It now becomes the 2d. A. J. Stace, Professor.
A new Geometry class, largely attended, has just commenced. W. Ivers, A. M., Professor.
First Algebra.—Continues its lessons as psual. W. Ivers, Professor.
Second Algebra.—No change. Bro. Joseph, Professor.	‘
Third Algebra.—Promoted to Second: Messrs. F. Crapser C. Ilgenfritz.- A. J. Stace, Professor.
Fourth Algebra.—A new class, just started, with over 25 members. Bro. Francis de Sales, S. S. C., Professor.
COMMERCIAL COURSE.
Notwithstanding the frequent announcements and publications concerning the requisite studies in this course, many of those now studying Bookkeeping consider it the only qualification to entitle them to a diploma.
Again. we call attention to the fact, that Bookkeeping alone is not sufficient, and that no one will be entitled to a diploma who shall have failed to complete the entire course as laid down in the catalogue.
The 1st or graduating class is now composed of the 2d and the 3d Book keeping Classes of last Session, and during this Session it is expected that the studies as marked out for the second year of the Commercial Course (see Catalogue, page 22) will be strictly adhered to.
The Commercial board met as usual, and after witnessing the examination, decided to award a diploma to Joseph Harrison, Hardin, Ill. The examination was more thorough than ever before, and the proficiency of the students certainly deserves commendation.
First Book-keepiry.—Messrs. H. H. Schnelker, L. Schmeider, E. Bahm, J. Vocke, J. Alber, J. Broderick, M. Hite, W. Sangster, are allowed to discontinue.
The 2d and the 3d Book-keeping become the First, and are divided into two classes of the same rank, the attendance in each Class being twenty members. A beginning class, composed
of thirty-five members, has just commenced. L. G. Tong, M. A., Professor.
The reports in the classes of the Preparatory Course, Modem Languages, Fine Arts, will appear next week.
The directors of the various Societies and Clubs are invited to send us reports concerning the state of their Societies or Clubs at the end of the Session just closed.
Scientific Department.
No 5.—The Microscope. -
This wonderful yet simple instrument of dioptrics is known by all, but understood by few. We desire, therefore, to explain to our young readers the principles on which that curious little contrivance is made; but we cannot do so to our and their satisfaction in only one column of the Scholastic Year, and that is all the space which our Proscrustean friend of the “ Stick and Rule” allows us in this number. We must then content ourselves with merely giving a few facts concerning it to-day, promising however to furnish, at no very distant day, a more extended and scientific description of it.
The word is derived from the Greek language, —as indeed are nearly all scientific terms,—and is compounded of mihros, small, and scopein, to see, to see small (things.) We may define it to be an optical instrument by means of which we are enabled to see and examine objects too small to be seen or discerned by the naked eye; in other words, it is a contrivance that gives to the human eye, by means of lenses or mirrors, an enlarged view of minute objects. It is a principle in optics, that objects whose visual angle is less than one three-hun-dreth of a degree cannot be seen by the unassisted eye: the microscope enablesus to view them, by increasing the angle of our vision. Therefore the proper objects for the microscope are all those things too minute to be distinctly viewed by the naked eye, and they may be of three kinds: very small bodies, such as seeds, insects, sands, etc.; very small pores of the skin and bones of animals, or of the fibers and textu re of plants; and very small motions of liquids or fluids in animal or vegetable bodies. Microscopes are properly distinguished into simple or single, and compound or double. Simple microscopes are such as consist of either a single bi-convex or plane con

vex lens, or of several such lenses superposed, but acting as one, and through the focus of which the object is viewed directly. Compound microscopes are composed of at least two converging lenses whose axes are placed in the same straight line, and these lenses are so arranged that an enlarged image of the object formed by one of them is magnified by the second, (or by the others, ifithere are more than two,) and it is that image which is viewed, and not the object itself. The simplest form of a single microscope consists of a mere convex lens or spherule made of any transparent substance, such as glass, rock-crystal, etc.
A single microscope composed of two planoconvex lenses whose focal lengths are in the ratio of 3 to 1, is called a doublet; one with three such lenses (the plane side of the one is placed in contact with the convex side of the other, and the distance being retained between these two and the third) is called a triplet. There are several kinds of compound microscopes: refracting, reflecting, solar or camera obscura, and the microscope for opaque objects.
“ Why has not man a microscopic eye ? For this plain reason, man is not a fly. Say what the use, were finer optics given, T’ inspect a mite, wot comprehend, theheaven ? "—Pope.

Be Free.—Those of our students who use tobacco on the sly, and thus expose themselves to unpleasant consequences, because tobacco has become their tyrant, would do well to call on Bro. Thomas and procure a box of “Dr. Burton’s Tobacco Antidote.” It will enable them to abandon with ease a filthy, expensive, and dangerous habit. It will improve their general health, render their company more acceptable to those who do not use the vile weed, and elevate them in their own estimation. Try it, young men; you will never be sorry for having done so. It enabled me to con quer the tyrant without the least difficulty, as I shall perhaps tell you soon. It will do the same for you, and make you bless the man who discov

Letter of the Faculty to Very Rev. E. Sorin, Superior-General.
Vert Rev. Father General:
We have received through Rev. Father Superior, your well wishes for the New Year; and though rather late, we hereby desire to reciprocate most warmly those well wishes and congratulations. It does not seem proper on such an occasion, even though we are a sedate faculty, that we should be too serious with you, our ever indulgent as well as Very Rev. Father. We would therefore observe that you are somewhat to blame for our slowness in sending you our greetings for the New Year: for you have increased our numbers until our little company has become a large body, and large bodies, you know, always move slowly. It would appear however that you are desirous of remedying any defect of this kind that may have crept into your beloved institution by sending over that swift-footed French engine, the Velocipede, to rouse us from our sluggishness; the only danger is that the reckless swift-footed creature may carry us all swiftly to destruction before your return, as it already threatens to do, and that you may find nothing left of your dear Notre Dame except the fields and lakes which first welcomed you a quarter of a century ago. This would indeed be a sad result of your generous gift; and we rather think that the Velocipede is the emblem of the rapid race Notre Dame is to rnn in the attainment of all that is true, beautiful, and good. We have heard with much gratification that you propose to return in time to celebrate with us the silver jubilee of the institution you have founded. This jubilee will be an epoch in the annals of catholic education in America, and most fittingly graced by the presence of one who has done so much for its interests. To continue the work that you have so well begun must now be our useful and agreeable though arduous duty. We beg your blessing on our labors, and in return assure you that our prayers will ever ascend to the Throne of Grace for your continued health and prosperity.
We are, dear and Very Rev. Father, Your devoted children in Christ, The Faculty of Notre Dame.

Presentation of a Carpet to Professor J. 'A. Lyons, A. M.
Upon returning from his usual travels, Wednesday, Jan. 20th, Professor J. A. Lyons was made the happy recipient of a magnificent present by the members of the St. Cecilia Philomathean Society.
This society, of which he has the honor of being the president appreciatinghis indefatigable labors in their welfare, determined to manifest the sincerity of their attachment and affection in a worthy and becoming manner.
For this purpose they decided to procure something substantial.
Taking advantage of his absence last Wednesday, the committee from the society carried the design into execution and furnished the Professor’s room with a Carpet and Mats. This being completed a presentation address was prepared and arrangements made for the reception. The complete surprise can be more easily imagined than described. The following address was read by Mr. J. F. Ryan, on behalf of the committee.
Dear and Respected Professor :
Allow us, in the name of the St. Cecilia Philomathean Association, to present to you a small mark of our esteem and affection, and express in a very few words our great obligations to you. As we have had no previous opportunity to wish you a “happy year,” permit us to tender you onr warm felicitations for the ensuing twelve months.
Often, when we think of our entrance into dear Notre Dame, and how we might now have been in oblivion, as it were, we cannot help thinking of our immense obligations to you. We know also that we have often disappointed and perhaps grieved you by our misconduct, but we promise you never again to displease. Our very best efforts will in future be put forth, as we very well know that they alone can please you.
Many of our number have belonged to different societies under your care, and how your strenuous efforts in their behalf have been appreciated, only they are able to tell.
Physically, mentally and morally, their condition has been essentially improved. For years you have devoted a great part of your time to the advancement of the mind, and we feel proportionately grateful for it, although we know that it is not in our power to repay you fully.
We are very sorry that we cannot express ourselves as we would desire, but we hope that you will take “ the will for the deed.”

176	THE SCHOLASTIC YEAR.
Please accept this carpet as a token of friendship. Hoping that you "will be our honored President forever, we remain,
Your affectionate St. Cecilians,
M. Foote, '
D. J. Wile, J. F. Ryan, J. Coppinger, ,

During the reading it was perceptible that the Professor was---; well anyhow he was not on the cars, although probably he would rather have been. All were quite anxious to hear his speech. Notwithstanding the confusion occasioned by the crowd at the door, the Professor seemed master of the situation; he recounted the
adventures he had gone through during the day? and expected that certainly he would have a good night’s rest upon returning home; but in this he found himself,—he did not exactly know how,— in fact'he could scarcely recognize that he was in his own room, and concluded his remarks by promising to see them all together at the next meeting, when he would thank them at length.

St. Cecilia Philomathean Association.
The 14th Regular Sleeting of this Association was held on Saturday evening. January 16th, in the New Association Room.
After the usual preliminaries, the President made a few remarks on the manner in which the members should commence the Now Year; after which those appointed to read essays and deliver speeches came forward, each in his turn, and acquitted himself respectably. Among those who excelled, the names of D. J. Wile and Mark Foote must be mentioned.
The lath Regular Meeting of this Association took place on January 23d. The first business in order at this meeting was the choosing of officers for the next Session, which resulted as follows :
Vice-President and Critic—J. F. Ryan; Vice-President of the Dramatic Branch—J. Coppinger; Vice-President of the Historic Branch—D. J. Wile; Vice-President of the Orpheonic Branch— V. Hackmann; Secretary—3L Foote; Treasurer—Jas. Dooley! Monitor—R. McCarthy; Corresponding Secretary—M. Mahony’ Librarian—L. Wilson; Assistant Librarian—R. Staley; Assistant Monitor—W. Clark; Director of Readers—F. Dwyer; First Conductor of Public Entertainments—P. O’Connell; Second Conductor of Public Entertainments,—J. Deehan.
The 16th Regular Meeting of this Association took place January 26th. After the regular business, the question that the “ Pen is mightier than the sword,” or that moral suasion is more efficient in the work of civilization than physical force, came up for debate. Among those who took an active part, Mr. R. McCarthy especially distinguished himself on the negative, bringing the decision quite unexpectedly over to his own side.

St. Edward’s Literary Association.
Notbe Dame. Jan. 20,1869.
Mb.Edhob:—A very spirited debate took place in the room of the St. Edward’s Literary Association on the occasion of its 14th regular literary session, Tuesday evening, the 19th inst. The question: “ Are wealth, rank, and personal beauty better
passports in society than education?” was warmly discussed on the armffiative by Messrs. D. A. Clarke and E. Fitzharris, atd on the negative by Messrs. J. E Shannahan and W. P. Rhodes. All these gentlemen presented their arguments in a clear and forcible style, and Mr. Shannahan spiced his speech with some telling strokes of wit.
Considering the debate as a whole, we can only congratulate the partakers on the occasion, and look upon the evening’s entertainment as an additional link in the pleasant chain which binds the members of our Association together in their noble efforts to acquire knowledge.	Reporter.
