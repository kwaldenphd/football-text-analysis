On the Moisture of Mathematics.
» ■ —
What! Mr. Editor,—Mathematics a horridly dry study! I am surprised that you should admit into your otherwise valuable columns an article of so sickening a character as that which appeared in a late issue above the signature of “Fizzick A. Snype”, among whose other utterly craven-hearted and drivelling assertions none is so abominable as that which predicates dryness of the Mathematical Sciences. Faugh! Listen to the poetry of numbers in the the following sublime quotation—the well-known description of Neck-or-Nothing Hall in Sam Lover’s great master-piece, “ Handy Andy ”:
“ One lord there sat in that terrible hall;
Two ladies came at his terrible call, One his mother and one his wife, Each afraid of her separate life;
Three girls that trembled—four boys that shook, Five times a day at his lowering look;
Six blunderbusses in goodly show;
k Seven horse-pistols were ranged below;
Eight domestics, great and small, In idlesse did nothing but curse them all;
■ Nine state beds where no one slept;
Ten for family use were kept;
Dogs eleven with bums to make free, And a bold “ thirteen” in the treasury. Such its numerical strength I guess, It can’t be more, but it may be less.”
jThere, Mr. Editor, read that, will you, and then talk about Mathematics being dry! But we needn’t go any further than our own venerable halls if we seek the poetry of number. What do we see on our first entrance into the University? Angels to the right of us—angels to the left of us—putting down numbers! Enter further into the adyta and you will see numbers climbing up a stump on one side and sliding down a bell on the.other. There is poetry for you!
As for “ Snype’s ” boots, which he seems resolved to place beneath our notice, he compels us to remark that he i wears 12s, polished to the highest degree of brilliancy, as । if he gloried in the enormity of his feet. It is a mercy that j Ryan’s pond is dry, otherwise he would assuredly put his foot in it. My advice to him is, to leave Mathematics alone entirely, and spend his time around the railroad depot, looking out for a chance to carry some illustrious stranger’s carpet-bag and umbrella, thereby earning enough to moisten his parched weasand; and perhaps, even, by getting into a row with a few previously bribed counterfeit canal drivers, he may make out to escape with the aforesaid carpet-bag in the melee, and thus purloin sufficient to . satisfy the cravings of his debilitated hypodiaphragmatic (regions, which have long been strangers to the fruits of honest labor.	'
Poor wretch! I pity him! Please find room for my
opinion of him, which may open his eyes, and lead to his amendment. Also, inform me if you would like to have a series of articles, entitled “Rejuvenation Gossip with the Girls,” by a friend of mine who signs himself “ D. A. D.” By attending to these slight requests you will much oblige	Your true friend,
Amby Dexteb.
Our Opponent beyond, his Depths.
It is the conviction of all that “ Joe’s” latest movement in the intellectual arena teHs keenly against him. Aware of the meagre means at his command, it did not require the gift of prophecy to foresee the pitiful failure of that manoeuvre. Whatever may have been our estimation of him heretofore as a vigorous quill-driver, a better acquaintance with his mental grasp has, to our unfeigned sorrow, cancelled his remotest claim to be longer considered by us other than a drivelling scribe. Gladly would we pronounce a more flattering eulogium on his literary finish, and applaud his skill in squaring accounts with us, did his last- unsubstantial piece of patch-work give us a precedent. Would we.be honest if, after rising from the perusal of his production, we advanced a more commendable opinion of the writer’s tactics in a field where he is so manifestly far from home? Sooner would we incur the odium’of being -thought too severe, than strike off at a right - angle from the royal road of truth. Even his admirers who believed him capable of making us wince under the dexterous thrusts of his pen, when they crowded around the “latest Scholastic’,” like bees around a honey-pot seeking for savory-morsels “Joe” had inconsiderately failed to serve up, were not disposed to indulge many encomiums.
We present “Joe” our felicitations for the sagacity he unwittingly displayed in the choice of a title for his nonsense. The heading of an article is presupposed to foreshadow the essence of the matter to which it is prefixed. “ Much ado about nothing,” has served this purpose most admirably. Requested to expect “ nothing,” we were not disappointed in finding “ nothing there, and nothing more.” Dismissing that poetic embellishment of sonorous sublimity, and passing over the superannuated excerpts supplementing it, we run full tilt against an imaginary stronghold, “ Mistakes of Fact,” wherein “ Joe ” has taken an imaginary refuge. Bless him! that fortress, even though we understood not its real name when levelling it with the dust, has disappeared as if it never had been. The foiled commander instinctively shrinks from the admission. It will be the work of our leisure to tumble down about his ears any minor fortifications he may throw up to cover his retreat. He has been sorely wounded to reflect that we were so unsoldierlike as to pick up the headless arrow he discharged at us, barb it, and hurl it back to pierce a vital spot. “The flesh will quiver where the pincers tear.*.

But we are not necessitated to select our weapons from ‘‘Joe’s”, armoiy. We have unsheathed a finer tempered blade than any of “ Joe’s” manufacture, and if in the contest itgiyesnot forth the clear Damascan ring, it is owing to the wboden truncheon it comes in contact with. Wherein have we acknowledged our inconsistencies ? “ Joe ” catches himself-in the toils of an inverse ratio, presuming a theory before he proves the fact on which he bases it. His transparent motive in endeavoring to distort our words into-S 'semblance of what he would wish them in reality, andthe insinuations that distilled from his pen in one.or two passages in the tail-piece of his answer, do but aid in his own discomfiture. We bid him adieu for the present, and hope that ho-will find a perpetual round of pleasure in the high latitudes of wit, whitherward he was journeying when last heard.from. If, after he descends again to the latitude of common sense, he gives a guarantee that any performance of ours on his “ cellar door ” would dissipate that strange hallucination leading him from his proper sphere so frequently, we will give the exhibition. It might not be inaptly wound up by the University Band rendering thatinimitable quickstep “Joe, get up and get,” while the invited guests might truthfully chime in, “ For you are pursued hot foot, to your confusion, by Harwich.”

.	’Twas painful to see old Seventy-Three
, Hobbling along with his hand on his knee,
' .The white hair hiding his wrinkled face
’ As he passed, from the College with humble pace.
The tears came into our eyes as he went And the last five cents we had were spent To get some pie, which we gave to him, And he chawed it well though his eyes were dim, . (We would offer a pipe, but he never smoked),
Then his hand we took,—but our speech was choked, . And he spoke of the time in the College he’d passed, .. >■ And'how he had got his diploma at last,
. And ,th? twelve-month course he had just got through;
Then tie clock struck twelve, and he said “ Adieu I ”
•	Scarcely his form was out of sight -	1
, When tumbling and stumbling left and right -
A wee little boy through the snowy night	-
Came up the road that the old man went And towards the College his steps were bent!
He scrambled the steps that lead to our Hall I
' And we followed close lest he should fall, - He was muffled in clothes from his toes to his chin
And he opened the door and tumbled straight In !
But the eyes that peeped from his cold little face With wonder filled at the Seniors’ place!
He seemed bewildered! We ventured to speak;
But soon we found he’d a pile of cheek,
■ And, to judge from the way that he spoke to us, He seemed a regular smart little cuss, For while we spoke he recovered his speech,
'	And said, as his little voice rose to a screech,—
•	“ You fellows, shut up! You’ve not seen me before,
‘ “Why, I’m the new Minim ! I’m Seventy-Four !”

A Life of Washington is issued by a Yeddo publisher. This literary novelty, says a correspondent, is brought out in no less than forty-four volumes in the Japanese characters, and is profusely illustrated in the highest style of art. Washington is represented in the clothes and fashion of the present day, and with a moustache, carrying a cane and accompanied by a Skye terrier. He is gazing at a lady with a train, Grecian bend, and a hideous waterfall.—Pen, and Plow. -	-

A sad accident occurred last Wednesday evening. While a certain number of students were returning from promenade through Lowell, four of them—Messrs. H. Pendill, J. Lonergan, W. Ball, and C. Hess, who had remained somewhat behind—tried to make time and rejoin their comrades by taking a short cut over the race. W. Ball had nearly passed over when H. Pendill and C. Hess ventured to foliowhim. They had proceeded a few steps when Mr. Pendill unfortunately fell through the ice; and C. Hess, who hastened to his rescue, met the same fate. W. Ball, hoping to save his friends, retraced his steps to assist them but broke through himself. The water was some 10 or 12 feet deep, and the race at that point some 50 feet wide. The cries of the young men soon brought assistance from the neighbors: planks were thrown in, whereby W. Ball extricated himself and got on shore. C. Hess in the meanwhile worked his way out, but H. Pendill, who had complained of being unwell that day, seemed utterly heedless of the efforts made to save him. He must have been seized with cramps as soon as he fell in the water, for all attempts to rouse him and draw his attention to the plank placed near him were useless. After five minutes’ apparent unconsciousness, he went down in spite of the efforts made to save him. It is a pity that a boat was not near at hand, as in that case he might have been helped out. .
The body was recovered one hour afterwards, under the intelligent direction of Sheriff Turnock. J. Lonergan had the good sense not to venture on the ice, and thereby was saved from danger. W. Ball and C. Hess were treated very kindly at the Singers’ office, where they warmed themselves. They then went to the Dwight House in order to get a conveyance to the College. They asked there for. some blankets to wrap themselves in to prevent themselyes from being chilled through during the trip from South Bend
to the College. The blankets were refused. They then asked a driver belonging to Ireland’s livery if he would take them over to the College, said driver did not appear very willing, but finally consented to take them if they had money. Mr. Reed, the gentlemanly foreman of Nicar & Co., took charge of the young men, and showed them a kindness for which they feel extremely thankful, and which ue will not soon forget. They arrived at the College at p. m., and received all the care and attention they needed in the Infirmary. They are now in excellent health.
At the coroner’s inquest, the verdict of accidental drowning was rendered in the case of Mr. H. Pendill. We deeply regret his loss, and sympathize w’ith his good parents in their sad bereavement. His brother arrived here on Friday and took charge of his body, which will be interred at Negaunee, Michigan.
In relation to this sad accident we feel it a duty to thank God who has thus far preserved our students from any such accident on our Lakes. This w.e owe to His kind providence and the care we take to see that our students do not go on the lakes before the ice is strong enough to preclude all possibility of accident.
We deem it our duty to call the attention of our students to the treatment Messrs. Ball and Hess received at the Dwight House and from Mr. Ireland’s driver. >.We call their particular attention to the fact that several students (under age) were given liquor or wine in the saloon attached to the St. Joseph hotel, and that in many instances, however little they partook of there, they felt sick afterwards. It was the case with H. Pendill, who might be still living had he not drank a glass of wine in that saloon.
It is true L' Uniters, of which that staunch Catholic M. Louis Veuillot is Editor-in-chief, has been suppressed for two months by the French Government, and M. Veuillot must consider himself highly honored to have his paper ranked with the Episcopate and the Society of Jesus among the defenders of the Church that are powerful enough to excite the enmity of Bismark.
Prince Bismark, the Pomeranian Beast—as one of his present party friends called him some years ago when B;s-mark, then Count Bismark, adhered to the Conservative party—wishes to pick a quarrel with France and involve her in another war before she be ready to cope with Germany, especially reinforced as the imperial troops will be by the troops of that worthy ally and obsequious puppet Victor Emmanuel. The German Chancellor thought that by imposing the payment of five milliards of francs upon France he would cripple her financially for the next twenty or thirty years, and thus he would have nothing to fear from her, but could carry on his persecution of the Catholic Church to the bitter end. In this he is disappointed. France, after paying that enormous sum, is f ir better off financially than Italy w’ith all her stealing of religious and ecclesiastical property, and is in as good a financial condition as tne German Empire in spite of the millions extorted from her. Besides, the Bishops of France in their mande-ments or pastorals, and the Catholic press openly show as they should, their sympathy with the Holy Father and their detestation of the tyrannical acts of the German, Swiss and Italian Governments. Bismark has taken these utterances of the Bishops and the Catholic press as a pretext to enter a complaint against the-French. Government, and would like nothing better than to^have the French reply

now to his arrogant demands as they would reply were 'France fully recovered from the terrible defeat she suffered in the last war; for then he would have an excuse to declare war again on France unprepared, and with his usual astuteness manage to throw the blame on her.
This is the explanation of the seeming pusillanimous action of the French Government in advising the Bishops to be more guarded in their pastorals, and in suppressing the most auti-Prussian and most intensely French paper of M. Louis Veuillot.
We cannot unreservedly blame the French Government; for the Duc de Broglie, the principal Minister, one of the liberal Catholics,—who have no higher means than political scheming, and no loftier motives than worldly prudence,— is acting according to the light he has and the principles he professes. He is acting -prudently in his opinion, staving off the Prussian attack until France be better prepared; and no doubt many will applaud his proceedings.
On the other side we fully approve the outspoken articles of M. Louis Veuillot and the expressions of sympathy for the Holy Father and reprobation of Bismark, Victor Emmanuel, and all such tyrants. It would indeed prove that France has fallen low—lower than she has—if there could be found no one south of the Rhine to protest against the arrogant injustice of those men and to stigmatize their actions as they deserve to be. And we sincerely hope that far from losing pecuniarily by this two months’ suppression, M. Veuillot may gain by it, by an increased circulation of his invaluable paper.
Quite a stir was made in the English and American Catholic papers on account of some remarks of M. Veuillot made on America. We wish he had not written them, yet we do not see why the papers should be so hard upon him. In the first place, M. Veuillot spoke of America, not merely of the United States, as far as we can learn, for we did not see the article in the Uniters, but only translations in'the papers that took the matter up. In the second place, if he had read any of our own political papers he certainly had good reason for most of his conclusions.
. We look forward with pleasure to the 20th of March, when the Uniters will take its place again with Unita ■Cattolica at the head of the Catholic press.

THE SCHOLASTIC,
The new Choral Society is organized. It has already a large number of members. . ,
Maxy of our friends have been made happy; the corn doctor reaped a harvest among them on Monday last.
A great amount of ice has been cut this winter from the St. Joseph Lake. We understand it was mostly done by parties from South Bend.
Several Classes recite after supper now. This is in consequence of not having time for them during the day. We have none reciting before breakfist yet.
We see that great quantities of wood are being piled up around the Steam-House these days. Well, if folks there -would listen to good advice they would “ wood up.”
The “Yale patent desk lock” is quite a favorite among the Collegiates. Several of .these locks have been put on desks lately. Each lock has two keys: one goes to the proprietor of the desk, the other to the guardian of the Collegiates.
St. Valentine’s Day is near at hand. Lots of fun, but not for us. We wish it would never, come,' for folks do send us such horrid pictures on that day I It is fun for those who receive the pretty valentines with “do-funnies” all over them.
The Base-Ball Clubs are reorganising—holding meetings, electing officers, m iking big speeches about the spring contests. We think-they are rushing, the season a little.
Has the engineer at the Steam-House any soul, or does he believe in any hereafter? He believes we will all be warm enough in the next world, hence he will keep us cold here. It is not right.
It has been asked how many pieces of a man’s mind must he give away in order to lose it altogether? Well, we would say that two or at most three pieces from a sensible mind would diminish it considerably;. as for weak-minded persons, we would advise them to keep their mind entire.	•_;
