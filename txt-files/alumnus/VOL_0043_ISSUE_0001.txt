Dame Night 1965 


^A CENTURY OF SCIENCE' 
S
INCE ITS inception in 1924, the purpose of Universal Notre Dame Night has been to spotlight the aca­demic, scientific and cultural contri­butions of the University to our coun­try and the world. On this 42nd annual Universal Notre Dame Night we are singling out for special tribute the growth and development "of science on the campus since 1965 marks the Cen­tennial of Science at Notre Dame. 
It was in 1865 that Notre Dame's first curriculum in science was estab­lished, though individual science cours­es had been offered even earlier. The first science graduate, in June of that year, was John Cassidy of Chelsea, 
(See cover, opposite and page 16) 

Michigan, who later became a South Bend physician. In 1865 Notre Dame's total college enrollment was less than 200 students. 
Today the College of Science alone has an enrollment of 600 sophomores, juniors and seniors, and 328 graduate students are pursuing advanced degrees in the Graduate School. The college today consists of departments of biol­ogy, chemistry', geolog)', mathematics, physics and preprofessional studies. Af­filiated with the biology and chemistry departments respectively are the Lo­bund Laboratory and the Radiation Laborator)'. The College of Science fac­ulty numbers 108, all but three of

whom have their doctorates. They are 
engaged in research supported by more 
than $2.5 million in grants annually. 
To sketch briefly developments 

through the years: 
The University Bulletin of 1866 featured mathematics and science courses including natural history, natu­ral philosophy, astronomy, chemistry and mineralogy. Science Hall was erected in 1884 as the home of the physical and natural sciences under Father John Zahm. Before the turn of the century Father Zahm had published four books, three of them dealing with the relationship between science and religion. Meanwhile, his brother, Al­bert Zahm, had built at Notre Dame the first wind tuimel for aeronautical research and flew man-carrying gliders from the roof of Science Hall. In 1895 Prof. Jerome Green, a member of the engineering faculty, was the first Amer­ican to send a wireless message. 
Rev. Julius Nieuwland, C.S.C., a name to be reckoned with in Notre Dame history, joined the faculty in 1904 after receiving his doctorate at Catholic University of America. It was Father Nieuwland who was to found The American Midland Naturalist, the Notre Dame biological journal, and it was he, of course, whose research led to development of the basic formulae for synthetic rubber. Today Notre Dame's principal science hall bears his name. 
Prof. James Reyniers began his pio­neering work in germfree animal re­search and technology in 1930, and 
Notre Dame Alumnus, February-March, 1965 
PROF. JAMES REYNIERS, one of Nofre Dome s discoverers in the biological field, started 35 years ago, as a graduate student, with germfree life experimentation which led to the establishment of the celebrated Lobund (laboratories of 
Bacteriology). Germfree techniques have 
aided medical, dental, even space research. 
the techniques which he, his associates and successors have developed through the years have become important tools in biological and medical research. The Biology Building, more formally desig­nated Wenninger-Kirsch Biolog)' Hall, in honor of nvo noted priest-scientists, was erected in 1937, and die Lobund germfree life building ten years later. ° Notre Dame's research in nuclear physics began in 1935 with tlie con­struction of one of the nation's first 
atom smashers on the campus. In 1942 the first research in radiation chemistry took place on the campus. Today Notre Dame's research in radiation chemistry is the most extensive under way on any college campus, and it is housed in a $2.2 million Radiation Research Build­ing erected by tlie U. S. Atomic Energy Commission. Another new facility is the 
Computing Center and Madiematics Building whose phenomenally fast UNI VAC 1107 Computer e.xpedites re­search throughout the University. 
These are a few of the milestones in science at Notre Dame during die past century. 
The Centennial of Science at the University will spodight them dirough­out 1965 with a series of special events, lectures and e-xhibits. 
Fadier Hesburgh, who is a member of the National Science Board, said die centennial obser\'ance will not only focus attention on Notre Dame's past contributions to the various sciences but also the current educational pro­grams. 
Dr. Milton Burton, professor of chemistry and director of die Radiation Laborator)', was appointed chairman of the Centennial of Science Commit­tee by Dean Rossini and outlined the scope of the centennial observance. 

While the observance will be year­long, die principal events are scheduled for May 14-15, Burton said, in conjunc­tion witii the spring meeting of the University's Advisor)' Council for Sci­ence and Engineering. A Centennial of Science convocation will be held the afternoon of May 15 with an inter­nationally prominent speaker and die conferring of honorary doctorates on a number of eminent scientists. A Cen­tennial Dinner is to be held that eve­
ning in the North Dining Hall. 
TRIBUTE AT REUNION 
Outstanding alumni of Notre Dame's College of Science are to be awarded centennial citations during die colorful alumni reunion weekend on the campus June 11-13. Approximately one thou­sand Notre Dame graduates returning to the campus diat weekend will re­ceive briefings on scientific develop­ments at the University, view exhibits and attend a banquet. 
Exhibits throughout the year will dramatize the growth and development of science at Notre Dame and die major contributions of Notre Dame sci­entists to dieir respective fields through the years. Burton said. Each of the col­lege's departments and organized lab­oratories is planning exhibits for the concourse of the new Notre Dame Me­morial Librar)'. 
Prof. Burton said centennial lecturers will be presented by each of die science departments during 1965. Among the eariy centennial lecturers were Prof. Harold Cassidy, of the Yale University chemistry department, who spoke Jan­uary 13; Prof. Eugene Rabinowitch, a member of the University of Illinois botany and biophysics departments and editor of die Bulletin of Atomic Sci­entists, who lectured January 20; and Prof. Charies C. Price, of die Univer­sit)' of Pennsylvania, president of The American Chemical Societ)', who spoke 
February 18. Price is a former head of die Notre Dame chemistry depart­ment. 
Burton said planning is under way for a major centennial event to be held late in die year. It will be a symposium marking the 100th anniversary of the publication of Gregor Mendel's find­ings on heredity in 1865. The work of Mendel, who was a Roman Catholic monk, has had a profound elTect upon die sciences, philosophy, literature, the­ology and history. 
Members of die Notre Dame Cen-, tennial of Science Committee, in addi­tion to Dean Rossini and Chairman Burton, include associate deans Dr. Lawrence Baldinger, who also heads the department of preprofessional studies, and Dr. Bernard ^Valdman and department heads Dr. Robert Gordon, biology; Dr. Ernest Eliel, chemistry; Dr. Raymond Gutschick, geology; Dr. Thomas Stewart, mathematics; and Dr. Charles MuUin, physics. 
Other committee members are Dr. Don Mittieman, director of the Com­puting Center; Dr. Morris Pollard, di­rector of the Lobund Laboratory; Dr. Emil Hofman and Dr. Jeremiah Free­man, chemistry department; John Ris­ser, assistant director-administration.

from your Alumni Secretary 

FIRST ALUMNI WORKSHOP.­
•OUR SECOND 100 YEARS' 
O
NE OF THE reasons — not the only one. but definitely one — for the ability of the University of Notre Dame to enjoy marked progress, especially in these recent critical challenges to higher education, was the historical fact of an ."Mumni Association which gave it its first great assist in 1868. 
Again in 1908, with permanent re­organization, a major era of University growth—under the late Rev. John W. Cavanaugh, C.S.C. — was accompa­nied by a continuous growth of the activities of the Alumni Association. 
.\nd in 1923 — with the establish­ment of the first Alumni Office and the ALUMNUS magazine, and a profes­sional staff (modest as it was) — the post-^VorId War I era and the Univer­sity's first public fund-raising campaign were augmented substantially by alum­ni programs already under way (Old Students Hall fund, local Alumni Clubs, etc.) and by the new channels of communication. 
Enrollment — helping to secure it during the depression years, and help­ing to screen it in the more recent pres­sures of the population explosion — has found alumni cooperation readily at hand. 
Hardly a phase of University devel­opment escapes an alumni identity someplace in its progress. 
So it is that, as the Alumni Associa­tion nears its 100th anniversary' in 1968, the historic occasion seems a most appropriate one for a re-evalua­tion of the total Alunmi Association program. 
Growth has been continuous and constructive. We could have taken the line of least resistance and simply ad­justed from year to year and hoped for new success. 
But in studying the problems ahead of us which relate to the Association and to the University, especially those of mutual concern, your Alumni Office and your Board of Directors uncovered some major trends and some new chal­lenges, along with fascinating oppor­tunities. 
To neglect or postpone consideration of these would not only jeopardize our progress, but it would be a basic de­parture from the leadership and alumni thinking of our first 100 years. 
Therefore, on January 13 and 14, 1965, in conjunction with the winter meeting of the Alumni Board, the First Alumni Workshop was held on the Notre Dame campus. 
Its primary purpose was not to solve new problems, or change programs, but to take the indicated long look at the upcoming second 100 years of alumni organization. It undertook to relate the trends and the problems and the op­portunities, not only to the University but to the basic divisions of the Associ­ation — the Classes, the Clubs, the Magazine, and the Fund. 

The Workshop enlisted a relatively small cross section of people whose areas of interest will affect, or be affect­ed by, the decisions of the Association. 
These included the Alumni Board — whose four new members will hold of­fice from 1965 to the Association cen­tenary year. It included top adminis­trators and the deans of the University. And it included a small cross section of Club, Class, and Foundation officers from the alumni groups outside the campus, together with key student leaders. 
The projection of the tremendous opportunities facing the University, and already in sight, provided a back­groimd for the Workshop which em­phasized the urgency of consideration and the jeopardy probable if \'ision should fail. 
This first Workshop was explora­tory, identifying, crystallizing, in the broad nature of preliminary sketching of the panorama beyond 1968. We hope that the analysis of its conclu­sions and recommendations wU dic­tate subsequent Workshops that, in more detailed nature, will consider the special areas of the alumni world we face — Clubs, Class organization, the Foundation program. Placement, Ad­missions, Student programs, and the new and e.\citing area of Continuing Education implemented by the immi­nent Kellogg Center. 
The forward look of every alumnus will be essential to complete success. And every alumnus will be increasingly involved in the challenges and accom­plishments ahead. Your interest and cooperation and views are sincerely solicited. JEA

EDDIE ANDERSON RETIRES 
With the advent of spring football practice, we are reminded that two great coaches of the Rockne heritage 
— both e-xemplar)' Christian gentlemen, accomplished in a number of fields — have left the scene. Harry Stuhldreher '25 is mourned by all since his death in January, but Dr. Eddie Anderson '22, dean of American football coaches, has departed only from the gridiron after compiling a record with hardly a parallel among living major college coaches since the death of A. A. Stagg. He will continue his medical practice. 
Dr. Anderson, one of only a handful of men to have coached more than 350 football games — and even fewer to have won more than 200 — decided to retire in December after 39 seasons, 21 of them at Holy Cross College. One of the 10 "winningest" coaches in the business, he has been the nation's se­nior mentor since Lou Little retired. 
A skinny left end on Rockne's first team in 1918, he played with the great George Gipp and captained the squad in his senior year. Eddie coached at Columbia (now Loras) College for three years, then went to Chicago, simultaneously coaching at DePaul Uni­versity, playing professional football with the Chicago Cardinals and com­pleting medical studies at Rush College. 
Then followed ser\'ice at Holy Cross (developing stars like Bill Osmanski, who later spelled him as coach), Big Ten championships at Iowa (with players like the late Nile Kinnick), service in Europe with the Army Medi­cal Corps and a return for 18 more triumphant years, perennial success in the East-West and All-Star games. 
Married since 1929, Edward and Mary Anderson have four grown chil­dren. 


IN MEMORIAM: HARRY STUHlORBIBt '25 
The Four Horsemen will ride no more. Their quarterback of the past 40 years, Harry A. Stuhldreher, died in Pittsbuigb on Jan. 26, 12 days after undergoing major surgery. Harry had planned to pilot his fabled backfield, along with survivors of the Seven Mules (sec picture, page 38), back for one of their frequent appearances at the 40-year reunion of the Class of '25. Gathering in his mem­ory, the Class will honor veterans of the 1925 Rose Bowl victory over Stan­ford. 
Retiring from football in 1950 after 25 years as coach and athletic director at Villanova and Wbconsin, Harry en­joyed equally successful careers as an author, raconteur and marketing execu­tive for the US Steel Corp. He appeared as a speaker, often with his teammates, at thousands of banquets and athletic events. 
Recipient of the NCAA Stagg award and a member of the Football Halls of Fame, he is survived by his widow Mary, four children and four grandchildren.

'Roll Over, ieomrdol' 
A RECENT issue of Time magazine, fea­turing "The Cybernated Generation" in a cover story on "The Computer in Societ}'," seemed to imply that vocational specializa­tion and electronic technolog)- have pro­gressed to a point where we are becoming a race of button-pushing \'assals to machines designed to do more and more of our think­ing for us. Yet the December 30 convo­cation in observance of the 50th anniver­sary of Columbia University's Alumni Fed­eration seemed to suggest that there is one profession which has avoided that mechan­istic rut. 
-Alumni programs have not escaped auto­mation and cybernetics; no undertaking rendering service to thousands of people could hope or wish to do so. But the 24 people singled out for citation at Colum­bia's Program of Honors seemed to possess a protean range of talents worthy of the "Renaissance Man" ideal embodied in the person of Leonardo da Vinci. .And their duties would seem to require abilities and call on reser\-e5 of imagination undreamed of by the creators of digital computers. 
.•Ml 24 recipients of the Federation's Medal for Distinguished Service, to Education were or had been members of the .\merican .Alum­ni Council; eight were past presidents, one a founder, and cited posthumously was a former executive secretary of the Council. Their average ser\'ice was well over a quar­ter century, and the majority had performed a "triple-" or "quadruple-threat" function in administration, fund raising, develop­ment and editorship of publications. Their backgrounds ranged from the arts and sci­ences to commerce and the professions: some, like Har\'ard's poet-essav-ist Da\'id McCord, had achieved a national reputa­tion as writers or anthologists: others, like Io»va's Loren Hickerson or Ohio State's Jack FuUen, had profoundly affected politics and public discussion in their regions: all had applied their talents to the sen-ice of education in molding (in the phrase of the convocation address by Columbia's Dean David Truman) "the alumnus as trustee for society." 
Leading the honors list, and strikingly representative of the medalists, was James 
E. Armstrong '25 of Notre Dame, 1962-63 president of the 2500-member .American Alumni Council, member of the Golden Jubilee Committee and chairman of \-arious Council acti\*ities. 
Jim .Armstrong's official titles at the University are listed as executive secretary

JAMES E. ARMSTRONG '25, executive secretary of the Alumni Assn., is shown receinng a special medal from John W. Wheeler (right), president of the Alumni Federation of Columbia University. The award convocation was held in New York City on Dec 30. In all, 24 representatives of American universities, colleges and secondary schools received medals for "distinguished contributions to education" in alumni work. "The Program of Honors" marked the 50th 
.Anniversary of Columbia's Aliunni federation 
of the .Alumni Assn., associate director of the Foundation and editor of the .ALUMN'US, but this official listing, in proportion to his sen'ice, is equivalent to the \-isible portion of an iceberg. He has long been a member of the committee selecting recipients of the coveted Laetare Medal and committees for scholarship selection and review, as well as a planner of important University events like last year's Memorial Library- Convoca­tion and Father Corby Centennial at Gettys­burg or this year's Centennial of Science. His nearly 40 years at Notre Dame have included stints as director of public infor­mation and the founding of services which led to independent departments like the Placement Office. 
Elected annually as secretarj- by the .Alum­ni Board, he frames the programs of the Board, the alumni clubs and classes, the .Annual Fund and special events like over­seas tours, as well as records of the .Alumni and Foundation Offices. 
Perhaps best known as a speaker, Jim lectures on his first love, journalism, and makes an annual tour of his far-flung Notre Dame Clubs on such occasions as Universal Notre Dame Night (like last year's flight to Hawaii). But there is a demand for his ser\'ices as a toastmaster and speaker at extramural events that would tax George Jessel or Jim's late beloved classmate Harrj-Stuhldreher. It is the variety as well as the number of these occasions that amazes: a regular speaker for the Sales and .Advertising Council, he recently addressed the Midwest College Placement .Assn., a gathering of NCA.A ticket managers, and conferences on fund raising and alumni organization re­spectively at Case Tech and Southern Methodist University: his comprehensive grasp of problems and posing of challenges in each specific field is the wonder of other participants. Most remarkable is a felicity of phrase which he applies to light verse and essays worthy of Harvard's McCord. 
Such versatility is not readily programmed into a computer, and Leonardo himself might have been proud of .Armstrong's cita­tion at Columbia: 
2965 
 in its present form. 
"You have conceived faithfully and well a philosophy of alumni relations which is the foundation of wholehearted and stimu­lating response of the alumni body in splendid sen-ice to your esteemed .Alma Mater. Your glowing mind has fashioned in speech and writing a lustrous stream of communication to the family of Notre Dame in support of the premise you have stated in regard to the nurture of the alumni spirit, namely that the cultivation of the college man, commencing in the undergraduate years, calls for the obsen-ance of heart^^-arm­ing amenities, the skillful dissemination of useful knowledge and information to him concerning the goals and achievements of the University, and making available to him a program whereby his education and learn­ing may continue, all to the end that he will feel himself for all time to be an integral part of the institution. 
"To the American .Alumni Council, in which you sen'cd in numerous offices, in­cluding that of president, you have given w-ise leadership, inspiration, and sage coun­sel, and you are respected and loved as one of the ablest and most discerning of states­men." —JOHN- LAUGHLIX

CSC BROTHERS AND THE SCHOOLS 
They Teach Nearly 29,000 in Some 55 Insfifufions 
"TEACHING BROTHERS" used to be an 
epithet reser\'ed for the Fratres Scho­
larum Cliristianarum or Christian 
Brothers, but now it can be applied 
just as fittingly to the Brothers of Holy 
Cross. "CSC" now rivals "FSC" with 
more than 28,500 students in some 55 
educational institutions around the 
world: one imiversity (St. Edward's), 
six novitiates and scholasticates, 37 high 
schools and special schools in this coun­
try and 11 schools abroad on the con­
tinents of Asia, Africa and South 
America. Ten schools administered by 
the Holy Cross Brothers have enroll­
ments over 1,000. 
Two new high schools were opened 
last fall, one in the Eastern Pro\'ince 
and the second in the South-West. 
Bishop McNamara High School in 
Forestville, Marj'land, in the arch­
diocese of Washington, admitted 350 
freshmen this first year. The faculty 
is made up of eleven Brodiers and two 
lay teachers. The South-AVest prov­
ince school, a diocesan institution in 
AVichita Falls in the diocese of Dallas, 
will eventually be part of a coinstruc­
tional high school, but this year while 
the school plant is being built, the 
three Brothers comprising the faculty 
conduct classes in the Academy of 
Mary Immaculate. 
The third school, Bishop David Me­morial High School in Louisville, Ken­tucky, presently conducted by diocesan priests and lay teachers, has been in operation for several years. Tw o Broth­ers are on the staff this year and addi­tional Brodiers will be added in suc­ceeding years.

Notre Dame Alumnus, FebTuary-March, 1965 
HOWARD V. PHALIN '28, president of Field Enterprises Educadcmal Corp. and alumni members of the University's Board of Lay Trustees, led a group of his company's executives and their wives in a special audience %>°ith His Holiness, Pope Paul 
VI. (Mrs. Phalin, co-donor of the mural portrayinj; Christ the Teacher on the Memorial Library, can be seen at far right.) Accompanied by Executive Vice-President Donald McKellar and Rev. Armando Guidetti, S.J., who supervised the Italian edition, he presented special copies of Field's 13-voIume "I Quindici" ("Childcraft") and 20-volumc "II Libro del Mondo" ("World Book Encyclopedia"). Pope Paul presented silver commemorative medallions to all three, then gave bronze medallions to the rest of the party, which included representatives of the Italian subsidiary as well as the American party. In acknowledging the gift sets, the Holy Father commended the company for its dedication to the ideal of educating children and urged that concepts of morality and sound education should ever guide its editorial work. Howie's own account of the Papal Audience follows below: 
The day was a typical bright and sunny Roman day. Our part>' left the Hilton Hotel atop Monte Mario at 11 a.m. in order to keep our 12:45 appointment for the audience. In addition to Mrs. Phalin and myself, Mr. and Mrs. McKellar, the other board members present along with our Chicago group were Mr. and Mrs. .\ron Franco and Father Guidetti and selected members of the Italian company. 
We drove past St. Peter's Basilica and were admitted to Vatican City. The spectacular gardens were beyond description. Here we were met by members of the Swiss Guard. Upon presen­tation of our credentials wc were escorted to the second floor of the Papal Palace in the Vatican. Here we were met by a Count Mario Stoppa of the Vatican staff and were escorted through ceremony and pomp to a Monsignor Paul Marcinkus, a member of the office of the Papal Secretary of State (and former Chicagoan). He remembered meeting Marshall Field and Don McKellar in 1953. He then took over and took us to a chamber for briefing. We then went to the room where we were soon to be greeted by the Pope himself. He was escorted into the room by several aides and sat upon a raised dais.

AN AUDIENCE 
THE VAT/CAN 
By Howard Phalin 
He evidently had been well briefed as he spoke first in Italian to a translator and then gave his remarks in English. He thanked us for wanting to see him and expressed his pleasure on our being present. 
I was then asked by an aide to come forward to make the presentation. The World Book Encj-clopedia was on a table to the side of the throne. I carried the A Volume, which had a special presentation page. I told the Pontiff that in behalf of our company it was my great honor and pri\ilege to present this edition of The World Book bound particularly for His Holiness as a token of appreciation and respect for his great dedication to Christian unity. You could see his eyes sparkle in thanks. In return he presented me with a silver medallion in remembrance of the Ecu­menical Council. He then spoke slowly in beautiful English saying he had known of our company. 
Father Guidetti then gave him the first volume of "I Quindici" (our Italian edition of "Childcraft, the How and Why Library"). Father Guidetti too received a medallion, as did Don McKellar. Then each member of our party was asked to meet the Pope sep­arately and each received a medal. 
We then received the Apostolic Blessing. PiX this point the Pontiff expressed his admiration for our company and our work and asked me to extend from him his Apostolic Blessing to ever>'­one associated with our company — editorially and otherwise as well as those engaged in its distribution. 
This unforgettable experience is impossible to record. For my own great honor I can never repay the debt to my company. The company gave me, as it gives ever>-one who joins it, a chance 31 years ago. It gave me training and the priceless freedom ot opportunity for ser\'ice and honor. I feel that in no other com­pany, to such a degree, could a boy from a small village without friends of influence or inheritance look ahead as he sat as a teacher, in his first job in a country school, with such great hope. This company gave me a certain amount of success. It has permitted me to be in high places throughout the world, to meet statesmen, ambassadors, and a former President of the United States, and now the Supreme Pontiff. My debt to my company is beyond my • power to repay. 
After the audience I left our party and went alone to the Basilica of St. Peter, the largest church in the world. There I thanked God for ray privileges and said a prayer for our company and every person connected with it.

WILLIAM J. JACOBS '42 and classmate Fr. Bede Fitzpatridi OFM (extreme left and center, respectively, in 2nd row) were reunited on the faculty for the introduction of the CursiUo Movement to Japan. Fr. Bede is a Franciscan missioner in Japan, and Bill was the author of various eyewitness reports as managing editor of "Ave Maria" magazine. 


JAPAN REPORT 
By William Jacobs 

Japan swings. I don't know if we'd better hurry up and convert the Japanese or hurry up and let them convert us. I only know that Japan swings from mighty, bustling Tokyo now the world's largest city .. . to the teeming city of Yokohama . . . through any number of other cities where industry and progress overwhelm you .. . to peaceful little Kamakura, where I fell in love with the whole population of 40,000. . . . 
I went to Japan to serve as a professor during the first two Cursillos conducted there in English. I met a fantastic assortment of people, saw and heard a fantastic assortment of things. . . . 
Father Siegfried Schneider, OFM, met me at the airport. I didn't know until the next day that he was the top ranking Fran­ciscan in Japan. We went by ta.\i to Kamakura where the Cursillos were to be held in a Redemptorist retreat house. Father Siegfried is an old China hand, now 60, but looking about 43, and ver>* jaunty in his black tarn. On the way to Kamakura in thf* middle of the night we exchanged anecdotes. His topped mine easily. He had been in solitar>' confinement as a prisoner of the Chinese Reds for 2i/2 years. "It wasn't too bad. I needed to lose weight," he quipped. . . . 
Father Siegfried finally guided the taxi driver to the retreat house. It was almost 3 a.m. when we arrived. The taxi ride was really something. Americans in Japan claim that all former Kami­kaze pilots are now taxi drivers. 
Gwyn Vaughn was in bed, but awake, in the room we were to share during the CursiUo. He comes from Tulia, Te-xas, and we knew each other well when I worked in the missions of the Texas Panhandle. We have worked a dozen or more Cursillos together in the States, but Gwyn has also journeyed to Ceylon, BerHn and the Philippines to help get the movement started. Now he was ready to ser\'e as rector of Japan's first in English. . . . 
In the morning. Father Bede Fitzpatrick, OFAI, gave the meditation and I served as commentator during Mass. Participa­tion was quite new to the 20 American servicemen and business and professional men making the CursiUo, and modem liturgical approaches were not completely known to the five priests present. 
(reprinted from Ave Maria magazine) 
It took only a few minutes to get the ball rolling, however. We used h}-mn cards I borrowed from Sacred Heart Church, here at Notre Dame, which pleased Father Bede, a member of the class of '42. 
Breakfast was a roUicking affair as it usually is at Cursillos. Then I got my first look at Kamakura . . . and fell in love instantly. It is surrounded on three sides by mountains. The other side faces the Japan sea. In the distance you can see the towering, snow­capped Fuji. The air has a strange softness. The variety of trees, shrubs and plants is amazing. 
The retreat house is just below Kara Kin Hill, a spot where 40 of the Shogun's soldiers took their lives after a defeat in battle during the I3th century. There are two Buddhist shrines near the spot and a little marker commemorating the dead. Kamakura was once the capital of Japan. It is also the birthplace of Zen Buddhism. 
The CursUlo vias a big success. I have never enjoyed ginng the talks more. The men had a fine time. The best joke of the session was told by an Irish Columban, concerning a schoolboy sent home with a note concerning his general lack of cleanliness. The teacher received a note in return which read: "Dear Sister. He's no rose. Lam him. Don't smeU him." 
A priest who spoke at the CursiUo provided another strong friendship. He is Father Bemardin Schneider, OFM, who is engaged in translating the Bible into Japanese. Father Bemardin is a tall, lean, scholarly fellow with an easy manner and a quick laugh. He and Father Siegfried are members of a family which has provided quite a few Franciscan priests, including Father Christopher, the priest of TVs "The Priest and the Politician." He's the fellow who while pastor of a church in Burras, Louisiana, took on Leander Perez and his disciples during an integration battle. . . . 
Back to Kamakura and the second CursiUo. This was at least the equal of the first. Again the Liturgy was a high point The second three-day period went much too fast. Suddenly it was time to leave Kamakura and I psmicked a little. I wondered if I could hold all that beauty inside me somehow. I was afraid if I left it I'd never really experience beauty again. It was weird. . . . 
A Little bit of Ireland

BILL AND FR. BEDE (3rd and 4th in the same row tkb pic­ture) were joined on the second CursiUo by M. (fin MatAew) James Peters '60 (2nd from top right) of tlie Amerian Embassy in Tokyo. The alumni aspect of this histaric orfaniM was increased by the use of hymn cards broi^t by Jacobs from Sacred Heart Church on the Notre Dame campas.

Plaming your Estate 
I. GIFTS OUT OF INCOME 
This is tile most common form of contribution. 
Federal Income Tax Law allows deductions for gifts to the University up to 30% of your adjusted gross income (gross income less business expenses and capital losses) in any one year. 
You may cany the balance of your deduction over the next five years should your contribu­tions exceed the 30% limitation. 
The actual cost of your gift is what you would keep had you not made the gift. It is the differ­ence between your top tax bracket and 100%. 
Example: If your gift is $100.00 and you are in the 50% bracket, vour cost is 50% or $50.00. 
In no case would your gift to the University cost you as much as its real value. The higher your tax bracket the less the net cost of the gift to vou.

WHAT IT TAKES, Part III 
is not selected at a school elsewhere? 
Conclusion-. The Role of Alumni 
By REV. JOSEPH W. HOFFMAN CSC '51 Acting Director of Admissions and Scholarships 
W
HEN I FIRST accepted tlie offer to present a few facts about admissions at Notre Dame I hardly expected that these articles would ex­tend to the length of a Russian novel. AVere I not hopeful that my remaiks may be of some interest and even of. value to alumni ever)-whei"e I would have limited my appearance in tliis magazine to one brief shining hour. Nevertheless, the topic this time is of such importance to some of our dedi­cated alumni that I am grateful to the editor for allowing me more space. 
In our first article we dealt largely with the changes in high school pro­grams and the effect tliat these cur­ricular re\'isions were having upon tlie preparation of college-bound students. Our intention was not to present any critique of the secondar)- school cur­ricula nor any kind of study in depth. Ours was rather a simple statement of fact about the kind of credentials a candidate ought to submit to the col­lege of his choice. 
Our second article dealt with the problem of tests. Our conclusion was that testing is here to stay and that the sooner we are able to use more re­fined tests with greater prudence and discrimination, the sooner we will be able to guide, counsel and even teach our students better. 
.\t this time I want to pay tribute to our Alumni Committees; both the College Night Representatives and the Intei"viewers. These are the quiet men. They operate without fanfare. They work tirelessly and their reward is the satisfaction of having served their Alma Mater well. 
Under the late Fatlicr Richard Murphy, C.S.C., certain Alumni Clubs established two committees, one for the college night representation, the other for interviewing candidates for admission. Although these committees are established with the voluntary' co­operation of the Alumni Clubs, under the careful guidance of Father James 
E. Moran tlieir number has grown. At present such committees are operating in more than sixty-five metropolitan areas. The first group represents the Univei-sity at college night programs to which the .Admissions Office has been invited to send a representative. We provide these volunteers with up­to-date profiles of our freshman class, fact sheets on our policies and bro­chures on pardcular programs avail­able at the University. Since it is virtually impossible for us to visit in any given year the nearly 900 sec­ondaiy schools from which we draw-candidates, we must rely upon alumni residing in these cities to act as our spokesmen. 

Their duties follow the general pur­pose of a college night program. They are to present information about the University' in order that the prospec­tive candidates and tlieir parents may be led to a pmdent decision about a college choice. They are influential in attracting qualified candidates to the University not only by providing in­fonnation, but also by their presence, by the conviction with which they pre­sent the opportunities at Notre Dame and by exemplifying in themselves the values which the University holds most dear. It is, of course, impossible that these men in such far-flung places should be intimately aware of ever}' nuance and detail of our courses. We have found, however, that the counsel diey give their listeners has been pru­dent, discreet and practical. 
The second alumni committee is en­gaged in inten'iewing candidates who have made formal application to the University. This is, indeed, a delicate task since so much depends upon the interviewer himself. Only the broadest guidelines may be laid down for handling an intci-view. So much de­pends upon the kind of rapport which the inter\'iewer can establish between himself and the candidate. The inter­viewer must bring into balance two polarities of interest: he must acquit himself of his responsibilities toward the University as well as those which he has toward the candidate. In be­half of the University he must tr)' to ascertain whether or not the candi­date is genuinely interested in Notre Dame. Is the candidate perhaps merely shopping about, selecting Notre Dame AVhat opinion does the candidate have of Notre Dame? What does he expect Notre Dame to provide for him? Furthermore, the intervifewer must ascertain something of the character qualifications of the candidate. Most of our alumni are already in positions where they must deal with people pro­fessionally. By lending their wisdom and experience in personnel problems to this particular situation they are able to learn a good deal about this young man. 
Regarding his duties toward the stu­dent the interviewer by the fact that he is involved in this type of work demonstrates the interest which the University has in those who seek ad­mission. The University of Notre Dame is, first of all, people; and for the young man sitting opposite him who has perhaps never had the op­portunity of visiting the campus the University is this alumnus. To this stu­dent an interview is an opportunity to offer some evidence beyond cold sta­tistics and the written testimonies with which the admissions officer must deal. However brief may be the in­ter\'iewing period the student realizes that the evaluation by an alumnus will become part of his permanent record and he wants the reports to be as hon­est and comprehensive as possible. Finally, the fact that the interview is being carried on by an alumnus lends a new dimension to the situation. Most candidates are well aware of the strong des which bind the alumni to Notre Dame and to each other. Hence, they know that should they be accepted for admission they will enter upon a new relationship with this interviewer which is somewhat unique. 
AVherever an inter\'iew committee has been established all candidates in that locality must answer the summons of the chairman or his committee member. It is not an optional matter as some young men in the past have thought. An office interview does not suffice to meet this requirement. AVe consider the alumni inter\'iew so im­portant we do not dispense w'ith it even when the candidate has been in­terviewed by the admissions officer on campus. In the past the alumni in­terview has been of considerable value in the selection of our candidates. 
In conclusion I want to repeat a truth which is so fundamental that it is frequently forgotten. The ultimate responsibility for accepting students in-

Result of a Rockefeller Foundation-spon­sored conference on "Religion and Social Change in Latin America," the book also contains papers by Latin American experts from Indiana, Pennsylvania, Rutgers, Wis­consin and Vanderbilt universities, the Catholic University of Chile, etc., as well as the leading Latin American labor unionist and a Washington economic consultant. 
Each contributor has a diflferent view­point, but most agree on the principal prob­lems: overpopulation, inequitable distribu­tion of land and wealth, inflation and finan­cial chaos, lack of technical skills or capi­tal resources, ignorance, lethargic leader­ship, etc., all producing a political unrest fomented by Communists and an anticleri­cal intelligentsia. The Church is losing her influence among the nominally Catholic masses in her complacency with the status quo and traditional alliance with the upper classes. As Prof. Pike warns in the intro­duction, "Unless Catholic social reformers are willing to come to grips with economic facts, religion will probably have little to contribute to reform in Latin America."

cover, 135 pp., $3.00. 
Prof. Hazo, associate dean of the College of Liberal .Arts and Sciences at Pittsburgh's Duquesne University, is perhaps better known as a poet than as a professor of En­glish. In addition to two previous volumes of poetry and a study of the poems of Hart Crane, he has worked on several anthol­ogies and written for the leading literary magazines. Recently he completed a State Department lecture tour of major univer­sities in Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt and Greece, reading his own and other American verse. 
This is the most comprehensive view of the Hazo landscape to date, containing high­lights from his earlier Discovery and The Quiet Wars as well as new work represent­ing the complete spectrum of his I>Tic pal­ette. "The Rebellion" is a nine-line mani­festo of his life and art, dismissing "the

No one else can lay before him the accumulated infonnation including the high school record, recommenda­tion of the principal, alumni reports, test scores and all the other factors which go into an admissions decision. No one else has had the opportunity to gain the proper perspective by read­ing, rereading and evaluating the

FATHER COUGHLIX AND THE NEW DEAL. Charles J. Tull, Ph.D., '62. Syracuse Uni­versity Press, Syracuse. N.Y. Clothbound, 292 pp., $6.50. 
Rev. Charles E. Coughlin of Royal Oak, Mich., pastor of Little Flower Church and popular **radio priest" of the 30's and 40's, joins Eugene Debs, .Adiai Stevenson, Nor­man Thomas, Gifford Pinchot, Osivald Villard and Henr)- Wallace in the Syracuse Press "Men and Movements'' series on "political and social nonconformists and their impact on the American scene." 
Author TuU, an assistant professor of history at DePaul University in Chicago, concentrates on the years 1926-1942 during which the eloquent pastor from Canada built up a radio audience of some 30 mil­lion Americans, first in vigorous defense, then in equally vigorous denunciation, of the administration and policies of Franklin 
D. Roosevelt, founded the weekly newspaper Social Justice and launched a succession of ill-fated economic, political and social move­ments before he was silenced by .Archbishop Mooney of Detroit. 
Every possible precaution is taken to make this a fair and unbiased analysis of the shifting currents in the tide (more ebb than flow) of Father Coughlin's "public" career: attack on the Hoover administra­tion and espousal of the New Deal program in one-sided "partnership" with the aloof Roosevelt; gradual disillusionment ivith the pace of reform and establishment of the National Union for Social Justice; uneasy coalition with Dr. Francis Townsend and (Gerald L. K. Smith in the Union Party and the disastrous Lemke-O'Brien ticket in the 1936 elections; and finally the confused allegiances of the Christian Front on the eve of World War II. 
Dr. Tull steers a steady course between "conservative" defenders and 'liberal" critics of the Coughlin program. He indicts Father Coughlin's economic naivete and oversimplified monetarj* schemes as a panacea, and the later isolationism, red­baiting .Anglophobia and anti-Semitism as demagogic straw-grabbing. But he con­cedes that wealth-controlling "international bankers" were one threat of the 30's and that the early tirades were inspired by sincere compassion for the poor and Detroit Bishop Gallagher's devotion to the economic encyclicals of Popes Leo XIII and Pius XI. He offers persuasive proofs that the priest furthered Roosevelt's programs much more than vice versa but cites the 1936 election IS refute any claim to real political influ­ence. Finally, he dismisses as unproved the liberal intellectuals' charges of Father Coughlin's insincerity, political ambition or "fascism," similarly dismissing the "intel­lectually fashionable" theory that this was a link joining Populism with McCarthyism and today's "radical right." 
.•Mthough lacking the cooperation of the Detroit Archdiocese or the aging pastor, who would prefer not to resurrect the em­barrassment of the past. Dr. Trull draws on all the papers and personalities of the Roosevelt administration with painstaking scholarship in this colorful study, acknowl­edging the help of the Notre Dame library staH' as well as Fr. Thomas McAvoy C.S.C. and Dr. Vincent DeSantis, former and pres­ent chairmen of the histor>- department.

His own ex­periences as a serviceman, writer and teach­er are reflected in the groupings entitled "Soldier," "Words" and "Students." Out­side inspirations, both sacred and profane, find their echo in "Summonings" and "Voices," while his most subjective expe­rience in life, love and human encounter is contained in the chapters "Myself," "Tan­gles" and "Now." 

Rich in allusion but seldom obscure, lean and sparing of rhyme, with an almost prosy colloquialism and clarity, the nearly 90 brief and pointed poems amply justify their dust-jacket description as "conversation." Philip Booth has written: "Samuel Hazo is a poet of human occasions, a man for whom poetry is no more occasional than the wonder of being alive. Decency in a difficult world is his subject; his poems engage that world TOth an individual love. They are poems strong in their humanitj', written by a hu­mane man." Literary journals have re­marked his "polish, sharp eye, wit and emo­tional range" or his "rare integrity: he can write honestly about himself and still come off with your respect and even affection." Winficld Townley Scott, writing in The N.em York Times, summarized that "his poems are more impressive as you reread them. A simple test indeed, but I don't know of a better one.'*

SCUTTLEBUTT ON THE SPRING SEMESTER 
A
FTER ENCOUNTERING the traumatic ex­
' periencc of a three-day final testing 
period and its logical sequel, an equally 
lengthy semester break, most students are 
already deeply entrenched in this semester's 
studies. Many expected an upward bounce 
of our basketball record. Pre%-iously there 
was a genuine anticipation that their season 
would be commensurate with the remark­
able performance of our football team. This 
desire may yet be realized in a few years. 
Others are still attempting to determine 
how much money ihcy donated to charit>­
as a result of their penchant for gambling 

over Mardi Gras Weekend. 
CENTENNIAL OF SCIENCE 

The College of Science under the di­rection of Dean Frederick D. Rossini has scheduled a series of special events, lec­tures and exhibits to mark one hundred years of science teaching and research at Notre Dame. The focal point of this ob­ser\'ance will be a centennial convocation and dinner May 15. 
Dr. Milton Burton, director of the Radi­ation Research Building, chairs the commit­tee planning the commemoration of the College of Science's Centennial. He is an­ticipating a great emphasis on science throughout the calendar year. Concomitant with this obser\'ance are a series of e-N­hibits depicting the nature, function and projects of the \-arious departments of the College of Science. They are being dis­played in the concourse of the Memorial Library for the duration of the spring se­mester. Meetings of a scientific nature will be increased as e\-idenced by the comple­tion of three Centennial lectures in January and Februarj- alone. Furthermore, the Reilly and Nieuwland Lectures will be Genten­nially oriented. One of the Reilly Lecturers will be Prof. Aaron Kuppermann of Galtech, who has gained recognition as a physical chemist. His lecture in October will be unique in that he is the first alumnus of Notre Dame to give a Reilly Lecture. The NieuwJand Lectures in November, tradi­
tionally amalgamating biological and chem­
ical interest, will feature Konrad Bloch who 
has recently been awarded the Nobel Prize 
for his Bios>-nthesis of Cholesterol. 
The Centennial convocation in May will feature historical reports by the dean and heads of the departments, descriptions of research acti\-ities, as well as open house and exhibits in all departments and labs of the College of Science. High point of the convocation will be a dinner in honor of a number of eminent scientists and pre­sided over by Father Hesburgh. The dinner will be culminated by a distinguished scien­tist and humanist who will address the guests on the nature of his work. 
This emphasis on science, and in particu­lar science at Notre Dame, will be mani­fested in both Spring Commencement and alumni reunions with specific recognition of our alumni scientists. Universal Notre Dame Night, April 26, will assert the merits of our College of Science as its tiieme. An interesting note to this obser\-ance is that the recipient of the first Bachelor of Science degree awarded by Notre Dame in 1865 proceeded to medical school and practiced medicine in the South Bend area. 
In conjunction with the Centennial ob­ser\*ance ground breaking for the new Life Science Building, to be located adjacent to the Mathematics & Computer Center and juxtaposed to the stadium, will take place in early fall. This magnificent 4j4-million­doUar structure will facilitate the teaching needs of the Biolog)- Department as well as accommodate the expanded Mosquito Genetics labs and \-arious Lobund Germ-free projects. 
FRESHMAN STAY-HALL PROPOSAL 

A current and highly controversial topic on campus is the proposal of a new stay-hall residence plan. "The basic feature of the proposal is the institution of an ex­perimental sj'stem of true four-class inte­grated halls for a trial period. Question­naires on the system will soon be distributed to the students and evaluated by the Stu-

dent Senate before final action on the plan 
will take place. If the plan is approved, 
an equi\-alent quota s)-stem wU be estab­
lished ne.\t year for .Alumni, Dillon and 
Farley. For Farley, it will be 88 freshmen, 
80 sophomores, 77 juniors and 78 seniors; 
in Dillon the numbers will be 120, 112, 104 
and 108, and in .Alumni 90, 82, 78 and 80. 
In three years the sj-stem would, accord­

ing to the proposal, be extended to the 
entire campus if its merits can be justified 
to outweigh its deleterious effects. -A factor 
in this consideration will be the existence 
of two new undergraduate residence halls 
within three or four years which would 
pro\'idc 600 plus accommodations. 
Proponents of the system feci that the new plan will attenuate the hiatus between class lines, hall unity and one's social sphere. It is also theorized by some that it will expedite the development of matur­it>' on the part of the freshmen. The polemic opponents of the resolution seek a return to the one-class halls or perhaps the adop­tion of a more adequate quota system for upper-class halls rather than mitigate the problems of the current stay-hall plan through the creation of an even more com­plex problem — Freshman stay-hall resi­dence. Their theory is substantiated by the argument that the Freshman Year of Stud­ies is set up to regulate their orientation gradually on the academic level, so why create a social-academic incongruitj- by integrating the four classes in their halls? They also point out the importance of a development of proper study habits and class ' unity while at the freshman level. 
The stay-hall plan will remain a major issue for a number of years until the factor of time can clarify the system. 
MARDI GRAS, WASHINGTON DAY 
The perennial and widely enjoyed fes­tivities of Mardi Gras at Notre Dame were again a success. It is hoped that $25,000 . will have been raised for charities, schol­arships and student projects as result of our participation in the numerous events. '­The colorful cami\'al and impressive Mardi Gras Ball and Concert were highlights of an unforgettable weekend. 
The Senior Class through its Washington Day Exercises has honored Sargent Shriver as the recipient of its Patriot of the Year ' Award. His work in and development of _ the Peace Corps as a means of improving '•' the conditions of our world have merited him the bestowal of this award. _, 
With our premature spring vacation only a few days away and Mardi Gras over, it ^ is difiScult to realize that we are already >, deep into the spring semester. Yet one only needs to glance at the pile of books on his desk to realize just how far we have progressed. ^.j

Alumni in Art— 
Anthony John Sorce, Painter 
MASSIVE OIL PAINTINGS, four to eight feet high, are typical of Sorce's style and subjects on canvas, wood and Masonite panels, primarily concerned with space and division of surface areas. Brooding quality of backgrounds and distortion of his attenuated abstract human forms, somewhat reminiscent of El Greco, have caused one newspaper writer to describe his theme as "loneliness expressed through death figures." The artist's objection that his recur­rent theme is creation and the human condition is borne out by such titles as "Incarnation," "Cruci­fixion" and "Resurrection." Although subject matter sometimes inspires a work, his principal involvement 
is form and the working out of 
plastic problems. Usually "only in the process of painting and coming to a kind of solution of these prob­
lems does a subject emerge." 

ANTHONY SORCE BF A '61, MFA '62, is building a large and enthusiastic public in the Midwest and just beginning to win a wider recognition. In recent months, beside exhibits (University of Michigan touring show, the first national print exhibit at Western Michigan U., midyear exhibition at Youngs­town's Butler Institute) and one-man shows (Nazareth Col­lege, Battle Creek and South Bend Art Centers), he had a painting on display at the New York World's Fair (Michigan Room, Pavilion of American Interiors) ; exhibited drawings at the Instituto de Cultura Hispanica in Madrid, Spain; was the subject of an article in La Revue Moderne des Arts et de la Vie, Paris; and began to exhibit in New York galleries. 
A native of Chicago, Tony won a scholarship, Chicago .Artist Guild prize and diploma from the .American .Academy of .Art before coming to Notre Dame. On the campus he was awarded annual Ivan Mestrovic student assistantships right into grad school, plus the Jacques Silver Medal in his senior year, meanwhile taking honorable mentions at the Illinois State Fair Professional .Art Exhibit, the Chicago .Artist Guild watercolor show and the New York Society of Illustrators scholarship con­test, as wc\i as the $200 purchase prize at the Chicago Union League art exhibition. Since then he has exhibited in the .American Watercolor Society show at the National Academy of Design, the Liturgical .Art Exhibition at the U. of Illinois, Watercolor US.A at the Springfield (Mo.) Art Museum, at Northern Mississippi Valley, Michigan, Michiana and Kalama­zoo area exhibitions. 
.Although his reputation is slowly becoming international, Tony is keeping his regional roots as an instructor and artist-in-rcsidencc at Nazareth College, Nazareth, Mich. 
STRONG DESIGN is evident in all Tony's drawings, subordinating scenery and figures barely sketched to abstract geometrical form in the manner of Cezanne or the later Cubists. He is equally at home with pencil or pen, brush or engraver's needle, mixing such media as ink, gouache, wax, watercolor and polymers.

MAN and the MOMENT 
By Rev. Thomas J. O'Donnell, C.S.C, '41 
Father Coinfet and fhe Fever: A Time of 'Bitter Amietions' 
r. OoME HA\'E SAID that tlie Spirit of ^ Notre Dame can be found beneath a little white cross or on a grave marker of some sort. They have gone other­where on that unretuming journey, these men of the past, priests and 
; brothers and laymen. One of the priests from the early days, a Father Francois Cointet, C.S.C., is almost as unknown as the soldier in the tomb at Arlington Cemetery. He is buried beneath the church on the campus n&vt to Father 
. Petit and Father Deseille. Like them he was a missionary in heart and in fact. Like them he worked hard to bring love and hope to a wilderness. Like 
" them he died young so that a new-world might grow old. 
A Rare Spirit 

Father Cointet was ordained for the diocese of Mans in 1839 and assigned by his bishop to a parish in Chatillon. In this place and in this work he was indefatigable. He had an ardent zeal 
, and a rare spirit of order. Most of all he was a man of prayer. During those years as assistant parish priest he began to think more and more of foreign mis­
• sions. He matured his hopes and long­ings in prayer before God. Then one day he saw a letter from Father Sorin to Father Moreau. This was the clarion call. As with most things in life the good Abbe found opposition to his  hopes and plans. Finally he got permis­sion from Bishop Bouvier to leave for America and Notre Dame. This he did with great haste. The trip was not only long but the sea travel was violent. He 
'\ and his companions—two other clergy­men, several brothers and four sisters arrived at Notre Dame in July of 1843. 
Father Cointet would be the first to 

denounce any praise for himself. He would be the first to point to the others who also endured great hardship and gave their lives to work in this area. He would be much too busy to listen to praise. Read these words from an ac­count of him written in 1855, a year after his death. "After a fervent novi­tiate of one year, he made his solemn religious profession in Holy Cross. From that time he may be said to have had no other aim in life, no thought or de­sire . . . except, in a word, the salva­tion of souls. His zeal never failed; his charity was inexhaustible; . . . Self seemed to be, in him, forgotten, anni­hilated; no fatigue was too great, no labor too severe for him. God's interests were his only consideration and to secure these by the salvation of a single soul, he would, at any time, have willingly offered up his life." A glow­ing tribute, indeed. And mission-minded though he was, the dynamic little Frenchman was also assigned the task of teaching. The same source quoted above says: "The activity of his mind was so great that he frequently per­foi-mcd the work of two or three per­sons." Small wonder that Father Sorin used every means possible to keep him at Notre Dame. Small wonder that the new work in New Orleans kept seek­ing him. Those difficult years were difficult not only because of so much work to be done but also because of great sickness and many deaths. Those were the trj-ing times of malarial fever and cholera. In the late summer of 1854 nineteen new graves were dug. On the 13th of September Father Cointet, sick with fever, came back from his missions. He thought he would get well. But Father Sorin had seen too many 
saw he was going to die, I thought I would lose my mind. For eleven years he had been the glory, the light, the joy, and the life of the commimity and the missions." This was great praise from Father Sorin. 
.4 Desperate Fight 

All of us who have so much today owe much to those who sufTered so in the past. It b hard for us to ima^ne their trials and hardships. At various times between 1847 and 1855 an epi­demic crept on and off the campus. Each time, the angel of death was a traveling companion. A donnitor\' would become an infirmary. Anyone who was well enough to walk became a nurse. Funerals at night were not im­common. At one time five brothers and three postulants died. Up the road in Bertrand, Michigan, the poor sisters were also suffering. Students were at­tacked with the disease and sometimes they were sent home in coffins. And in South Bend and nearby towns the people were blaming Notre Dame for the epidemic. This was not really their fault. They knew many of the priests, the brothers, the sisters, the professors, the students. They heard of their deaths. They blamed a marsh that sur­rounded the lakes as the cause. What­ever the cause Father Sorin blasted, 
and not just verbally, the dam that made the marsh. He had tried to pur­chase the land that formed the dam but the owner was greedy and wanted an unfair price. The bearded patriarch had seen enough of suffering and death. The men of his heart who had worked so hard and died so young were not to be denied. This was their place; this was their life; this was their school. D)'namite it was, and as the murky waters of the plagued marsh slushed to the river Father Sorin remembered in Mass that Holy Thursday of 1855, the souls of those who fought the good fight, the men of every season, who died that we might live. The words of the psalmist must have been his many times during those critical years. 
. . . O God} forsake me not Till I proclaim your strength to every generation that is to come. . . . Though you have made me feel 
many bitter afflictions. You will again revive me. From the depths of the earth You will once more raise me up . . .

Chicago 
First of all, one big vote of thanks to the 1.257 who turned out to make the 1964 Rockne Memorial Dinner the most successful in Club histor>'. Not knowing that Ara and his legions would turn out to be the Number One team in the country, wc booked a "small" room that accommodates a mere 1,000. For that reason, nearly 300 had to sit in an adjoining room, but from the cheers that resounded through the Grand Hall of the Pick-Congre;s for ARA P-ARSEGHIAN, members of the Fighting Irish. FR-ANK LEAHY, and the Rockne nominees, it was evident that a good time was had by all. 
The next two club events—the Communion Break­fast • and Universal Notre Dame Night—are just around the comer, so watch for the announcements. The committees are working hard to make these just as successful a'i the Rockne Dinner. 
Again w% u'ant to salute the Rockne nominees, who Were chosen for their athletic abilitv-, academic a'-' ievemcnt and leadership qualities. The winners, who received their trophies from JOHNN"!" L.ATT­NER and TOM CAREY, are outstanding student-athletes. Richard "Chico" Kurzauski of Weber High School, won the Catholic League tro­phy. Chico. who gained more than 1.000 \-ards dur­ing the season and tallied 20 torchdowns. led his team to the city champiomhip. His coach %\-as JOE S.ASS.ANO *53. He also was an outstanding schoLir. elected president of his class for the past three years. Jim OToole of Riverside-Brookfield High School, one of the best high-school parsers in the countrj*, was judged the Rockne winner in the suburbs. Jim, another fine student, averaged belter than 14 yards a pass while completing 64 percent. Doug Boe of Lane Tecli. who qrartcrbacked hi*­team in the Public League finals, ^ras chosen best in that loop.

Hats off to Cliairman PAT SHANNON, who lined up a great program. Wally Phillips of WGX did a great job as toastmaster in the minds of all except JOH.WXY LATTNER, MOOSE KRAUSE and m>-self. ^Vally roasted us but good. It's a funny sensation to sit there laughing at yourself. Incidentally, Wally said later that he never has had a more receptive audience, so I think wc are devel­oping a mutual admiration society. 
FRANK LEAHY, of course, was the master as alwa^-s. A perfect gentleman, Frank renewed many old acquaintances, and made many new ones. I know that many of the youngsters In the audience will ne\'er forget the dinner because of their brief conversation uith Frank. No one in the country could explain the essence of Notre Dame to the nominees better than Frank, and the room was still as he talked to the bo>'s of the future. We cer­tainly arc in his debt for coming to Chicago for this important dinner. We hope that the plaque that JOHNNY LATTNER presented Frank for his many contributions to Notre Dame's football heritage will win a place in his den. 
Ara has turned into the best ticket seller wc have here in Chicago. He has been here three times now—UND Night, Golf Outing and Rockne Dinner—and all three events were SRO. Thanks, .Ara, fo- making mv presidcnc>' an easy job from 
;.' the financial standpoint! Every person at the dinner was extremely impressed with the 1964 captain. JIM CARROLL, who apoears to be the prototype of an outstanding leader. Wc hope that Jim.

Father Sullivan, a former member of the Notre Dame faculty and, until his recent appointment as provincial, president of Stonehill College, North Easton, Mass., gave an interesting ani informative talk on Notre Dame and on the activities of the province which he now heads. He outlined the \3St changes in the Notre Dame campus ^ncc he first went there as a seminarian, and described to the gathering the many educational and missionary ac­tivities under the care of the Eastern Province. 
The Holy Cross Fathers, incidentally, are vczy proud of the football team at Notre Dame High School, Bridgeport, which this year matched the 9-1 record of .Ara Farscghian's club and won the Con­necticut stale championship. The school b one of two bojV high schools conducted by the Eastern Province.

Dearborn 
Like all the other ND Clubs and alumni through­

out tite world, the Dearborn Club was overjoyed at 
the amazing success story ^hioned by ARA PAR­
SEGHIAN, his staff and the 1954 Fighting Irish 
team. To everyone who liad a hand in tlic most 
phenomenal comeback in the history of college foot­
ball, wc would like to add our note of appreciation. 
It certainly is ut>nderful to liavc our prestige restored 
and to see the famous spirit of Notre Dame at a 
supercharged pitch once again. 
About 30 of the Club members Iiad the foresight 

to fonn a canv'an of cars for a trip to the opening 
home game against Purdue. Needless to say, HANK 
DECALUWE, JIM ENGLEHART, BOB MISSEL. 
JERRY McINERNEY and all the others wen-
treated to a remarkable display of both offensive 
and defensive football. BILL FURHMAN and 
FRANK SHERID.AN were especially impressed with 
the fine work of sophomore Alan Page. After the 
game the carav'an headed north to the Diamond 
Harbor Inn to celebrate the victory*, and celebrate 
we did. Tlie only concern wc had on this almost 
perfect day w ^ whether Vice-prcs. R/\Y DEFAUW 
was properly versed in the Faith—when he was 
asked to give grace after meals he lead us in a 
Hail Mary! And after 16 years of Catholic education. 
The rest of the fall was relatively quiet regarding 

Club actixitics because so many of us were busy with 
excursions to South Bend evcr>' weekend. But the 
monthly meetings at JERRY KELLY's, DICK 
KING'S, RAY DEFAU>\"s and JIM KLINK's gave 
us the opportunity to relive the joys of each football 
gaae. The Club, mainly through the efforts of 
DON MULLANEY, is currently tr>'ing to cut 
through the maze of *'red" tape and help ND 
alumnus ALBERTO SALA2AR and his family leave 
Communist Cuba and immigrate to Canada. From 
Alberto's letters living conditions are unbelievably 
bad in Cuba, and until he can leave we are trying 
to lighten his burden somewhat by sending packages 
of clothes, foods and medicines. 
DICK KING is currently the busiest member a*. he is scurrying about distributing tickets for our annual fund drive. Unfortunately the winners cannot be announced yet because the drawing \rill be held later In the winter. 
The annual Dinner-Dance was held Jan. 23, co-chaired by BILL DOSMANN and BOB EIDE­SCHUN.

just as active and succi'ssful as the earlier part of

both of which were held during the month of 
Scptctnbcr. 
Our October monthly niceling w:is the occassion 
for our annual Sweepstakes dmvving wluch wc held

The outcome of the directors' meeting is recorded by the secretary in his report file and doubtless will not enjoy the wide circulation of other reports.

Milwaukee 
HUGH DEVORE was the hcadliner of a most successful football smoker, chairmanned by JOHN SCHLOEGEL, vice-president of the Milwaukee ND Club. On Sept. 21 the SctiHtz Brown Bottle was chuck full (110) of Notre Dainers and their guests to herald in the '64 season. The amiable Mr. Dcvorc was the profit in this profit-maker as he chuckled his way through past (some tme) experiences, the ups and downs of Notre Dame football ('63 edition) and what to expect under "Ara'' (could it be true?). In addition the football highlights of '63 were viewed, cards dealt and all thi; precariously floated on top of free suds provided by the host. Unexpected as a guest was CHARLIE BACHM.-\.\' of Notre Dame and Michigan State football fame, and now

FRESHMAN* WELCOME 

The 1964 Welcome was held September 10 al the Military* Park Hotel in Newark. Ninety-nine in­coming frc?hmen were honored by JiM GIBBONS and AL PERRIXE of the Foundation staff together with HARRY DURKIN, oar president. In what was probably the hardest hitting talk ever heard by in­coming freshmen from New Jersey, this group heard mojt ev'ery facet of Notre Dante life and received some constnictive tips on how best to cope with tho'e early problems that beset the newcomer. Especially pleased A\-as ANGE BERTELLI, whose young !on Michael was among the incoming frosh. FR^\NK TRI PUCKA, his loj-al friend, accompanied Ange. Frank, as you know, retired from pro fooiball after being singularly honored at **Frank Tripucka Day" ceremonies in the Polo Grounds two years ago. Moving x-ans Were needed to cart au-ay all the gifts from his many friends. 
W.-\LT CONNELL, a very close friend and asroci­aie of JACK PINDAR and BUD FOLEY, u ^ also present .. . his young son among the lucky ninety-nine. Walt, it will be remembered, received an award in September, 1961, from then Frexy BILL KIRCHNER for being the most outstanding subway alumnus. AKT TUTELA '33, a practicing ph>'sician from Short Hills, N.J., has a freshman son at school, .\nother son was graduated recently and is now in medical school in Italy. BILL KIRCHNER was at the affair. He has ended his ser\-icc to the State as personal counsel to Governor Hughes and is returning to become associate counsel of the N.J. Bell Tel. Co. 
GOLF OUTING 
Gene Dean again did his usual niagniHcent job al our Golf Outing held in June at the Glen Ridge Country* Club (recently renovated from the pbns of none other than BRUCE DOLD, our last Club president). 0\'er 130 alumni and guests attended thb year, and for the first time since Wendell Willkie canipaignrd at school in 1940 have wc seen stalwarts from the Class of 1941: BOB STACK, who now lives in Cresskill, N.J., TONY RO.MEO and SAL LAPILUS.\, both from Bayonne. Sitting with us were two young '64 grads . . . DON ROMEO, Tony's youngster, and BOB BUDENBENDER. Don was planning to ser\'e in the Peace Corps and was awaiting the call. Bob was planning lo go to law-school nearby .. . his dad was a former high school teacher of mine. Both bo>*s wtrc excellent examples of the fine young, vibrant and highly intelligent products that Notre Dame is now producing. Tony can be real proiid of his son. 
LARRY DOYLE was at the affair and, as usual, proved to be the most proficient golfer of the outing. DAN O'NEILL and PETE QUINN were also there . . . they are the Club's two main principab in running the football trip each year. PETE LUSARDI wus there with a real fine friend of Notre Dame, JOHNNY DRUZE. 
Election of officers took place, and H.-\RRY P. DURKIN was again elected to the prcsidencv. JAMES A. SEBOLD '50 is v-p; AXGELO B. .-\.MATO '42, sccrctao" and HANK BORDA *39, treasurer. 
We are hopeful, indeed, that when the 1965 golf outing is held i%*e will have at least 300 alumni and guests come out for what traditionally is a wonderful affair, the most relaxing one of the entire Club year. Everyone is urged lo make it nrxt year. 
.VAVY GAME TRIP The Nav\' game trip was a success both for the team and for the Club in terms of participation. It u-as a beautiful day made even more beautiful by what turned out to be one of the squad's best gnincs of the season. BILL TOBIN '42 and DAN CUL­LIN.ANE '42 were there, Danny with his young 5on. Dan, who is with a chemical firm in Connecti­cut, looked strong eiio*.:gh to lift ihe Rockne Memorial off its foundation. .After all these years. Dan still lifts weights and is one of the few* alumni who have muscles in their ear lobes. BILL TOBIN is with International Paper Co. and still single . . . and still longs for the good old da\-s when he drove everybody on the floor milty including the prefect. For the first time in almost a quarter of a century*, I met HA.\K CARR/\CIOLO '43, who is now living in New York but who originally came from Chicago. He's in the furniture business and his been away from the Windy City for about a dozen years . . . he was a close' friend of TONY GIROL/\MI and ELMER PEDERSEN both of the '43 Class. 
COMMUNION BREAKFAST On Dec. 6 the Club held its annual Conini-nion Breakfast: 200 alumni and their friends attendi-d this worthy event. Honored by the main theme of the Breakfast this year »-as the memorx* of one of Notre Dame's most beloved, distinguished and noble personages, JOHN CARDLVAL 0'H.-\R.\. who was president from 1934-1940. The main speaker was a per.onal friend, HARRY DURKIN, who gave an exceptionally stirring talk on Cardinal O'Hara and his relationship to the Military Ordinariate during World War II. The Club had the privilege of hosting two young men from the campus, PHIL SHERID.VN JR. and TO.M LONGO. These txvo young Notre Damers, both fine athletes bat, more importantly, fine young men, spoke briefly and commented on some film shown after the breakfast was over. Judging by the mimbcr of sons of alumni who were thrilled to obtain autograplis of the two players, it is safe to say that the spirit of their fathers has certainly passed on to their sons. 
PHIL SHERID.VN SR., the proud father of young Phil u-as with his wife Joan, and JOHNN'^'" iCELLY '40 (the '39 captain) with his wife Emmy Lou. John's son Bill is at Notre Dame together with his young cousin, JIM KELLY, presently a defensive specialist on the squad. JOE BYRNE III was there with his brother-in-law and between them had about ten youngsters, who undoubtedly will be honored when the Club runs its Freshmen Welcome in 1972. JOHN Q. .AD.AMS came with a group of friends and u-as verj' instrumental in making this 
 Charlie Bachman from Miami, Fla. 
affair as well as the 1962 Breakfast a success. Mr. and Mrs. Longo, Tom's parents, were present as were young Bob I^ipa's folks. Bob is a present defensive end on the squad who looks like he'll be playing a lot of football in '65.

0\'rr One thoasand alumni and friend> jo*irneyed 
to Philadelphia to sec Notre Danic and Naxy belabor 
each other. BUD MULVEY, BILL F.ALLOX and 
FRANK FEE took charge of the doings and what 
with the fine cooperation of the weatherman, the 
PRR and .-Vra's group, it was a memorable day. 
Notre Dame was well represented at the Heisman Award Dinner honoring JOHN HUARTE. It was like old times meeting so many ~ good and loyal friends, before, during and after the dinner. FR. HESBURGH and .-VRA P. represented the University for the occasion, and John distinguished himself with the charm and humility of his acceptance of this great award. 
On Dec. 8, the Club departed from tradition and held a Tuesday evening Corporate Communion at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York. FR. MOHER CSC said the 5:30 P.M. Mass, and then the s«»"P convened for dinner where we were officially wel­comed by Pres. GUS HARDART—at Schrafft's Res­taurant. Rt. Rev. John Paul Haverty, Sup't of Schools for tlie New York Archdiocese, and a long­time friend of Notre Dame, spoke eloquently of our obligation as Christian and Catholic men to share in the problems of the world today. JACK HOYT Mc'd the occasion and, with his deep personal attachment and close relationship to FATHER O'HARA, took us on a nojalgic trip back through the years, reviewing the warmth and affec­tion of many of the' anecdotes and wonderful deeds of oar beloved FR. O'HARA, "The Pope." The majority of those present knew Fr. O'Hara per­sonally and Jack's remarks rang many a responsive bell as he touched all the bases on his trip down memory lane. GEORGE FR.-\ZIER chaired the pro­ceedings with his usual cfHciencv. with an assist from TERRY ARMSTRONG. 
Club events scheduled for the new year included the Annual Retreat at Shrub Oak, both the ND basketball games in NY and some interesting social events planned by the N'Y, Westchester and Long Island divisions.

Following a week after the Southern Cal game. CILARLIE SL.\TT '33 was called on lo "alibi" the outcome. In lits usual sportsmanlike *v3y, Charlie rather paid tribute to the spirit of the Trojans and the opportunity for a future undefeated season. (Speaking of spirit, what an inspiration it is to see those two grand old-timers DOM CALLICRATE '08 and BILL SCHMITT 'ID show up year after year for this most typical of Notre Dame alumni gatherings. Thank >-ou, gentlemen, for \-our good example.) As captain of the '07 football team, Dom volunteered that perhaps the extreme diange in temperamre from near-freezing in South Bend tlie week before to tlie high 70*s of Southern Cal might have wearied the defense in the second holL BOB DWYER JR.

for Notre Dame men in Philadelphia, thanks largdy 
to the renaissance of the Fighting Irish football team.

attended by more than 2,700, and an informal 
dinner-dance for 300. BILL WHITESIDE '51 
Itandled the sale of 2,000 tickets to Club memberri.

The year was brought to a close with the annual Communion Breakfast, held this year at the Plnlo­patrian Club, following Holy Mass at St. Patrick's Chturh celebrated by our Club Chaplain FR. THOMAS DUFFY CSC *20. The Sunday \%-as dedicated to our late member and beloved preceptor JOHN CARDINAL O'HARA. 
The Philadelphia Club's Knute Rocknc ^femoriaI Award for the outstanding high school football pla>-er in the Delaware Valley continues to focus public attention and the eyes of prep football stars on Notre Dame. This year's winner, announced at the dub's Communion breakfast, was Bill Bartholo­mew, outstanding fullback on nationally ranked Salesianum High School of Wilmington, Del. .A committee induding JOHN H.ANNIG.AN '41, NEIL WORDEN '51, FRANK SPANIEL '50 and BILL WHITESIDE '51 did a tremendous job in screening hundreds of ^-oungsters for the av%'ard. 
An added feature of the avrard is a handsomc bust of Rockne, which goes for one year to the high school of tlie selected boy, who receives a smaller repHca of the trophy for permanent pos­session. Five other outstanding boys were chosen to receive Rockne .Avrard certificates.

Phoenix 
XD-MSU alumni held a joint TV viewing at the HiWay House. Smiling faces were apparent at half-time as Irish fans recognized the spark that liad returned. Although remote from campus facili­ties, the HiWay House lounge had one major ad-i-antagc foreign to Rockne Stadium. MSU and ND alumni were rightly impressed by the telephoto camera shots over the north stadium wall showing the facade of our new librarj-. For many here in the Southwest this was our first viewing. And under favorable circumstances, with BOTH scor^ boards showing good midchallcngc totals. MIKE BOSCO '50 was the bmicst man of the d.iy. He has a degree from both schools. 

Added enthusiasm was injected into the local Club by the team stopover on their way to USC. .-\Iumni and fans were at the airport to greet our champs on arri\'al. ART ERRA '30, vice-president, headed the welcoming committee, and JlSl MUR­PHY represented Arizona Gov. Paul Fannin in pre­senting ARA PARSEGHIAX with an honorary-Arizona citizenship. Local news coverage was grat­ifying and alumni wished for two or three TV sets to watch simultaneous sport shou-s. Notre Dame has continued to make press, which demonstrates the benefits of a winning combination. 
.An added bonus for the Thanksgiving wv;ckend was alumni admission to closed practice at Arizona State U's Sun Devil Stadium. As anyone would expect, local nuns "conned" their way in. 
TOM HEXNIGAN '42, president, ordered a block of tickets which were the most popular buy in town. Phocnbc was well represented in LA. Al­though the score read wrong at the finish cvcrv'­one returned agreeing ND pla\-s like champions.

The following day our annual Golf Outing was held at the Pittsburgh Field Club. Sixty golfers challenged this beautiful but difficult course, and none Were able to better par. There were some very fine scores recorded, however: PAUL HUDAK. our president, won the Henne Cup with a 74, fol­lowed closelv by CHARLIE TOTTM^VN with a 
76. and RICH JACOB with a 78. JIM HUTCH­INSON won the prize for the longest drive, and PETE FLARETY, who hit the shortest, was given a p.iir of hand strcngtiieners. In the absence of JIM MCLAUGHLIN, JACK SHEEDY JR. cap­tured the high-score prize of a green chloropliyl golf ball. .\ number of special prizes were a«-arded: GERRY TR/\VIS was given a case of beer donated by FRITZ WILSON for having an eagle 2 on No. 17; DR. VOSSBERG, now of Morganlown, \V. Va., had four straight birdies and also received a spe­cial prize. 
.After dinner that evening one of Notre Dame's most loyal supporteis, HARRY STUHLDREHER, gave another of his interesting talks. Guest speaker JOE TUCKER, Pittsburgh's popular sportscaster and friend of Notre Dame, presented us with a fine summary on the 1964 Stcelers. 
To top off a very fine evening, a colored film of the 1964 Masters Tournament was shown. 
Football fever ran high during the weekend of Notre Damc-Ktt game. On Friday night before the game Club members rallied at the Webster Hall Hotel with a response which we have not seen for some time. JOE GASPARELLA cmcecd the Rally and in his good-natured fashion accepted the com-

parisons made in good fun between the Notre Dame team and his Carnegie Tech eleven. Joe intro­duced such notables as HARRY STUHLDREHER. JOE BACH and HUGH DEVORE (who received a much-deser\cd round of applause). FATHER JOYCE and others. It was an enthusiastic prelude to what was undoubtedly the Iiardcst-fought game the team played this season. It was the true test of a cham­pionship team. Our congratulations to ARA PAR­SEGHIAN and his team on a great season. 
Our Christmas Dance was held on Saturday, Dec. 26, a tthe Pittsburgh Field Club. DAN BEGGY and BILL BITTNER, the co-chairmen, had prep­arations well in hand and a gala evening was enjoyed by all. 
JIM COONEY, the Foundation representative for our area, was in town Tuesday, Dec. 15, 1964-, for a dinner and telethon to actix'ate support for the Challenge II Program.

Last issue wc carried something about the activi­des of retired Supreme Court Justice ERNEST E. L­HAMMER 'Oi, LLJ). '54, as president of Lavellc School for the blind in the Bronx, N.Y. On Dec. 17 the 225 blind pupib at Lavellc reversed tradidon by giving a Christmas party for Santa Claus on his birthday. Judge Hammer, who has been present at Lavellc Christmas pardes since 1916, was 80 yean old. He was one of the original K of C members who pioneered the ''Christmas Daddy" movement now prevalent In schools for the handicapped, where­by indi\-iduals ansHxred the Lavalle children's Braille-M-ritten letters to Santa. The children's tribute was followed by a luncheon with Lavelle's faculty and Bronx officials. 
Judge Hammer, whose ancestors had been New-Yorkers since 1830, got his law degree from N.Y. Law School and honorary' doctorates from Fordham and Manhattan College.

As a member of dozens of professional, dvtc and religiotis organizations he had a hand in coundess New.York drives, monuments and landmarks. The Lavellc party was held in the new school hall, named the "ERNEST E. L. HAMMER Auditorium" by the Dominican Sisters and part of a $2 3 million build­ing development. Marking the Golden Jubilee of Bromc County's establishment, from which the Judge Is the only surviving offidal.

From the Alumni Offici-: 
Sympathy of the Class to the three surviving 

sistt-rs of JOSEPH A. GIBBON'S, who died in 
Wilkcs-Barre, Pa., in December. Joe, who had-
been retired from the Larks\'illc High School staff 
lor 25 years, kept his keen Jnlcrcst in the University 
and her athletics. One of his last acts was to iill 
out a pledge to the ND Foundation which his sisters 
hastened to honor. From his Sorin Hall days, cut 
short by WW I, Joe treasured the friendship of 
K. K. ROCKXE and FR. JOHN W. CAVAiVAUGH CSC. 
Speaking of Rock, Washington lawyer Jx\MES D. HAYES offered some lore to sport scribes on the 1913 Army game, drawing an interesting parallel between the Huarte-Snow and Dorais-Rockne pass combina­tions. For this and a challenge to a fascinating contest, read Jim's entr>' In the "Fifiy-Year Club" above.

Hi, Ole Timer: Trust that one and all had a 

nice Thanksgiving as well as a real memorable 
Christmas and may this Ne%v Year have in store 
for you and yours contcntncss and health. 
Your Class Christmas card, we trust, xvas ac­

cepted as a most sincere greeting — not just com­
ing from one, but an indiWdual greeting from 
eacli and every one of your 1918 classmates. 
E. M. "MORRIE"* STARRETT was on campus last year at the Monogram Dinner; we were lucky and got a good picture of him and Coach ARA PARSEGHIAN. Morrie hoped to see the USC game — trust that he'll admit we had a good sea­son and that vou can't win 'em all. 
JAMES L. SWEENEY wrote that SHER;V00D DIXOX and son PAT DIXON, with JOHN RILEY, were his guests on the Cog Railroad to the top of Pike's Peak. Jim states that it was his first trip in 40 years. Tliey called on JAMES L. HANLON and had lunch with RAY HUMPHREYS —JAMES 
P. LOGAN missing out due to a fishing trip. 
Heard from LEO L. COOK, who enclosed a clipping of the passing of FATHER MULCAIRE, former x-ice-president of the University. Leo also wrote about the passing of JOHN RA.VB last September. 
Had the usual red carpet scr\'ice on campus — ha\ing lunch with your managing editor, JOHN F. LAUGHLIN '48 and FRANK KELLY *50. Frank, I understand, goes around the country telling you why you should invest in Notre Dame. Walked around the campus and naturally "landed" in the Gym. Had a most interesting conversation with Track Coach ALEX WILSON. Learned that the Gym is to be torn down. Was informed that the distance men run about a 100 miles per week in training and "jog" a mile in time that won races for CALL and LOGAN. 
Always nice to hear from WILLIA^f A. "TEXAS BILL" GRADY, caught a nice picture of him at the Monogram Dinner. BILL got me the addresses of JOHN F. SAUNDERS '31, JOHN V. McMAN-NON '28 and JAMES O'HARA '13. Gotta extend our thanks to his daughter for the addresses. 
E. J. "STUFFIE" BURKE "chickened out" of his Oct. 1 sailing dale on the S S Bremen — due to hurricanes. "STUFFIE" states — as of now — still single? ? 
ALVIN H. "HEINIE" BERCER '15, RR^ Sturgis, Mich., writes that "the pictures . . . revive old memories of long ago — the days when wc were young, George, and the only care was not get­ting caught smoking cigarettes, skiving Church or . . . opening a windoiv after 12 pm. They «-cre the days when we were in bloom. Now look at us 
— gotta have our name in large print on coat so Wc won't be embarrassed when meeting an old pal at a reunion, and then say, 'Gosh, George, you haven't changed — would have known you any­where.' " Personally looking forward to seeing Bcrger, and I hope it'll be before his Class reunion this year. "Heinle's** last letter comes from Mesa, Ariz. — PO Box 1II5. He and the Mrs. are lucky, as they expect to remain away until April. 
MAXIMILIAN KAZUS — in town (his sister lives here) —* is looking great, and we had a real 
REV. GEORGE HOLDERITH CSC '18, ND gotf coach for 29 years before he retired in I960, received a surprise visit in January from four of his golfers, all from Detroit, paying tribute to his record of 210 victories, 75 losses and 12 tics. Looking over gifts (including a watch, a plaque and a testimonial book of clip­pings, letters and pictures from more than 200 golfers he has coached) arc: (L-r.) Bill Wilson '43, 1942 captain; Tom Shechan '39, 1938-39 captain; Father Holderith; Walter Hagen Jr. '40, the 1940 captain; and Dick Whiting '45, who played for the Irish in the 40's as a pupil of Fr. Holderith, who won the NCAA title in 1944. 
"bull" session over luncli. Max and Mrs. are 
enjoying good health, and the old government man 
is loaded with that green stuff. Max was there 
xvhen WILLIAM ETHELBERT (BILL) BRAD­
BURY returned the egg to the performer at that 
Thursday afternoon show — the guy was an actor 
and not a baseball player, so he got it in the 
puss. The act was cut out from that time on 
while in South Bend. Max recalled MOKE KELLY, 
the pitcher, and also HEINIE BERGER, who 
pitched and played halfback. Wanted to know 
what became of GEORGE W.VSHINGTON KO­
WALSKI. I had no answer — have you? ? ? We 
do know or remember the time a pail of \%'atcr 
was disposed of trom a ivindow on the 2nd floor 
of Corbv Hall. Guess some wise guy told FR. 
DOREMUS 'cause "POP" FARLEY also learned 
about it. 
Saw the Michigan State game, and it was great. FR/\NK X. R^T)ZEWSKI had the tickets —but I could not get him to walk over to the Gym for tliat Monogram Club lunch layout. It was good. 
It was great to run into DR. D. M. "DOM*' NIGRO in the Gym. He looks great and full of pep; he's got (o be, as his card h'sts him as a member of and afHIiated with 114 organizations — I counted *em — phis being president of the Nigro Clinic, Kansas City Medical Centre Downtown Hospital. "DOM" was there with his son, whom I believed he Introduced as being a doctor, too. Another old timer I met, looking just great, was Baseball Coach "JAKE" KLINE. Jake still is a regular guy, just the same as when he ""as playing on the ball team. The talk is that the new ball field will be named Kline Field; a lot of old timers hope that "The Powers Tliat Be" do name it after 
"Jake." 
FATHER HESBURGH no doubt was pleased to see Time Nov. 20 issrc ^vith COACH PAR-SEGHIAN's picture on the cover. (How about that Time jinx? Gee, perliaps Coach should have waited until after the 10th i-amc.) However, wc personally believe that Fx\THER HESBURGH de­lights more in awarding monograms to Notre Dame men like JOHN T. WHITELY '44 (see Forbes, Nov. 15 issue, page 34). 
Gotta thank BIG FRANK RYDZEWSKI for the loan of 1915-17-18 yearbooks — The Dome, The *I7 Dome has Big Frank's picture with the follow­ing caption: "Magnetic Pole." Guess the magnetic part was catching the "Pole" looking like a student 
— reading even. Hey, when was the last time yoti thumbed through your old yearbooks — The Dome? ? 
Sat jtist a few scats airay from ROY C. "BUTCH" WHIPPLE at the Michigan State game. He looked great; bet he u-as recalling the times he was playing 
on Cartier Field. "Butch" was a great player in 
his day, 
I gotta thank "Dom" (I mean DOCTOR D. M. 
NIGRO '17) for his letter and his interesting Travel 
Neu-slctter dated Nov. 25. Fellows, this "doc" gels 
around. He's just finished a Ralph Berry tour of 
the Orient. Then he writes: "The mo;t marvelous 
highlight of my recent travels was a personal invi­
tation to visit the White House, extended by Mr. 
Dave Powers by long distance, and one of the most 
poignant episodes in my entire life was my visit 
to the final resting place of our dearly beloved 
President Kennedy." I was looking for Dom Dec. 
7 at Chicago's Rockne Memorial Dinner — thought 
he'd point oat D.WE CONDON, DAVE & FRANK 
CHESROW and WINFRED S.MITH—but I did 
not get to sec him in that crowd; I know he wtis 
there as he had his picture taken with WILLIAM 
G. FERSTEL '00. 
Had a most enjo>'abIe time at the Rockne Me­morial Dinner — as, no doubt, did the other 1^500. Believe I gotta thank that young fellow DON RO ^ '53, Chicago director of the ND Foundation, for my good fortune in being assigned to table No. 86 iviih BILL FERSTEL '00, son JLM FERSTEL *48, DAN O'CONNOR *05, W. A. DRAPER '06, JOHN 
J. McKINLEY *49 and Dan's guests. Jim Daley and John ^L Daley. JUDGE ROGER KILEY*s chair WTIS vacant. Wc all read the card sent from the YVhitc House, addressed to Mr. and Mrs. Ferstcl, to wit: "The P*-esident and Mrs. Johnson extend their best wishes on the occasion of your 50th Wedding Anniversary." Abo the wires from FATHER HESBURGH. Mavor Richard J. Daley, Coach and Mrs. Pbrseghian and JIM ARMSTRONG, which greatly Impressed the Feistels. 
Kinda wish that such old-time Monogram men as Ferstel (baseball), O'Connor (track) and Draper (track) might have been recognized by the chair­man. Believe it would leave a good impression with the High School Football guests as well as the many teen-agers present. No doubt there were many more \Ionogram men 'round the room, but these men were at table No. 86. At our table was a fellow who has a piece of the very first batch of synthetic n-bbcr ever produced. Ferstel was there when FATHER NIEUWLAND, the professor of chemistry, cut it up into rubber heels. 
^faste^ of ceremonies was Wally Phillips, a re­nowned radio personality; he was a "knockout," had 'em roaring with tears in their eyes from laughter. Ask your Athletic Director ED (MOOSE) KRAUSE; bet ^foo5c will remember some of the nice things he said about him. 
Wc apologize if certain names have been often repeated, but please remember — we can only write 
Notre Dame Alumnus, February-Marchf 1965 35 
about thoM: wc hear from — so let's hear from YOU 
as Notre Dame is sincerely interested in each and 
c\"cry one of you. Send a hello to JIM ARM­
STRONG, youT Muxam Secy., or to JOHN LAUGH­
LIN A1.UMN145 editor. Call your Class president. 
If j-ou find it interesting to leam about the "other 
guy" in your Class, remember, he too would appre­
ciate hearing about YOU. 
Now as to >t>u young fello*^ — please permit us 

"old guys'* to roam and not stick to only '18crs

to appreciate the old rocker.

DR. EDW.ARD N. /VNDERSON has just retired from the college football coaching profession. He was dean of US college football coaches at his retirement, having completed 39 years of continuous coaching. His career started at Colum­bia College, Dubuque, Iowa. From there, he went to DePaul U. of Chicago — to Holy Cross College, Worcester, ^lass. — to the U. of Iowa •— and back to Holy Cross, where he remained until the end of lost season. Many special football honors were conferred upon Eddie over the years. In 1939 he was named Football Coach of the Year for fashion­ing one of Iowa's greatest teams. His standout player that season was Nile Kinnlck, who was named to the All-American team. In 1940 and 1930 he was head coach of the College All-Stars In their annual contest with the champion pro team of the prior season. The All-Slars lost the 1940 game, but won a decisive victory in 1950. On three different occasions Eddie was on the staff of the All-East team in their Annual Shrine East-West football game in San Francisco. On one of these occasions he ser\'ed as head coach and directed his team to \ictor>'. In January of the current year the good doctor again serx'cd on the coaching staff of the .All-East team for the annual Shrine game in San Francisco, and that was his very* last coaching assign­ment. As a player under KNUTE ROCKNE, Eddie had the reputation of being a very stalwart defensive end, although he was brilliant as a blocker on offense (in those days the same ends were used for offense and defense), and Eddie was captain of the 1921 team. He was one of the most rugged ends In ND history. In three years of high school and four years of football at ND (1918 was ruled out due to World War I) he never was out of play due to a physical injur\% When Rockne would turn the squad over to Eddie for a drill In con­ditioning, there was considerable ''griping," because his drill was mucli more arduous than that given by "Rock" himself. Of course, Eddie's teammates wondered how he come upon his granite-like phx'slque, but not many of them knew that he worked with a railroad section gang in the summer \'acation period driving railroad spikes to harden his muscles. Eddie was small In size compared with present-day ends, but in ruggedness he had no superior. Hearty congratulations and best w-ishcs to you, Eddie. Your classmates arc proud of your achievements as a player and coach and for your grand work in medicine at the Rutland, Mass., Veterans Hospital. Nile Kinnick of Iowa and Bill Osmanski of Holy Cross and hundreds of other Une football players will always remember you as a real gentleman and friend and an excellent coach. 
CHARLIE "RED" CROWLEY of Weston, Mass.. winged his way to Los Angeles to attend the USC game with his old teammate "CLIPPER" SMITH of Laguna, Cah'f. /\5 wc go io press, it-e do not have their special obser\'ations and comments on tlie game, but we do know that both are highly pleased with the t^-pe of play and the results of the '64 season at ND. 
With the retirement of Anderson from the college football coaching profession, also comes the end of all football coaching by the men of *22. At one time we had a sizeable aggregation of successful football coaches In the collegiate and professional fields. "HUNK" ANDERSON* did well at SD as successor to Rockne. Later, as line coacli of tlie professional Chicago Bears, he helped develop some of the greatest lines In Chicago Bear history. For years, he was co-coach with "CURLY" LrVMBEAU of the College All-Stars. Curly was a co-founder of the Green Bay Packers professional team and served as its Head Coach for many years. H.-\RRY MEHRE had fine teams at the U. of Georgia and later at "OIc Miss." "BUCK" SHAW performed admirably at Santa Clara U., the U. of California, the San Francisco 49*ers, and won a World Cham­pionship for his Philadelphia Eagles in closing out his coaching career. "CLIPPER" SMITH had splendid teams at Villanova for many years. Later he coached at Lafayette U. and still later he di­rected the Boston professional team. Tills list is not complete for we arc quite certain that CHET ^VYNNE and others left their marks In the coach­ing field. 
The RAY KEARNSes of Terre Haute, Ind., the TOM McCABEs of Elmhurst, III., and the AL SCOTTs of Los Angeles celebrated their 35th wedding anniversaries last October.

From the Alumm Office: Lau-ycr ROBERT P. GALLOWAY wrote to Time magazine from Silver Creek, N.Y., with mixed praise and censure for the cover storj* of Nov. 20. While lie enjoyed the article on Coach Ara Parscgh­lan, he took exception to such questionable back­ground as quoting the old legend that the famed shift devised by Rocknc was ''lifted from the rou­tine of a dance hall chorus.*' Documenting his ver­sion from the 1917 Dome, Bob recalled a close as­sociation between Rock and Sgl. George A. Camp­bell. USA (ret.), and recalled the sergeant cor­recting Rock on tactics. *'I like to believe," he wrote, "that Rockne's Notre Dame box shift was from the squad right-squad left drilling of the old sergeant.** Quoting Sgt. Campbell as telling Rock that if he ever had to face death "I would just as M)on do it leading my men." Finally he quoted a War Dept. document stating that Capt. George A. Campbell, 18lh Infantry, 1st Division, was awarded the Distinguished Ser\'icc Crosi posthumously for service near St. Mihiel, France, Sept. 12, 1918, as "he displayed exceptional courage when with three men he preceded Iiis battalion . . > and captured three machine guns and 20 prisoners."

From the Alumni Office: Secretary LOUIS BRUGGNER, a polished panel­ist with his friend GEORGE SHUSTER '15 on the program of the First Alumm Workshop, provided a pattern for meetings that will probably involve offi­cers of all the ND Classes before the Alumni ^Vssn. in 1968. At that time Lou remarked that our re­peated injunctions to brc\-ily had intimidated Iiim into providing no column at all this outing. Seriously, Louis will continue to provide all the news he gets, cither via column or newsletter, but there has been little beyond sad tidings recently. Reported deceased: GUS DESCH, Ol>-mpic hurdler and ND halfback (sur\*ived by his widow Claire and son Charles '51), Evanston, HI., in November; BEN FRANKLIN TYLER JR., Kansas City livestock trader (leaving irifc Mary and three children, in­cluding Ben III '56), on the same day, the day of the Michigan State game; and two erstwhile class­mates.

HARRY STUHLDREHER died on January 26 as this section of the ALUMNUS was going to press. To his widow Mar>' and his four sons, including John *DG, go our most profound condolences and the assurance of perpetual and prayerful remembrance. 
Tlic invitation to our October 3 "Life begins at Forty" Second Annual Parking Lot Picnic at the N.D.-Purduc game brought a bit of news of the '25ers. 
A nice letter from VIRG FAG.AN (731 Colum­bian Ave., Oak Park, III.) says in part: "That notice of the 40th year Class Reunion had a P.S. that scz time ain't standing still. Sorry I couldn't make the Cedar Point celebration because this was a pretty busy and eventful summer for the Pagans. First of all Dorothy and I joined the N.D. Club group on the Ifoly Land Tour in April. To say that the trip was wonderful is putting it much too mildly. Having FR. LEO W.-VRD '23 from the campus with us added immeasurably to the trip. He said Mass for our own group at all the holy places in the Holy Land and through to Rome. \Vc also visited Greece; Eg>-pt, Lebanon, Syria, Lisbon and Rome. Our one and only Nancy graduated from St. ^fary's in June and married in August to BOB BRUTVAN of the Class of '63. They are now living in Olean, N-V. where Bofa is studying for his doctorate in micro-biology at St, Bonnie's. 
'*In the meantime, yours truly finished his work­ing days at good old Scars and retired July 31. Let me tell you, John, there is nothing like the feeling of leisure and being able to do what you want, when you want. 
"Order of business for the fall calls for the first nine games and maybe the 10th at Southern California. It was good to see the boys carry 'ERIN' PARSEGHIAN ofT the field after that wonderful showing at Wisconsin. Maybe they've got something there for him to work with this year. Time will tell." 
Time did tell, Virg — it was a great season! Thanks for your letter.

Ed's death on June 5, 1964, of a heart attack 
while at work. £d was manner of insurance

BILL HURLEY also wrote to me about Ed. Bill 
was able to make the funeral which was held in 
Oakley, Mich., and represented the Class. A Mass 
has been said for Ed, and I am sure you fellows 
will remember him in your prayers. Our deepest 
sympathy to his family. 
A copy of a letter from JIM ARMSTRONG 
brought news of the death of EARL McCARRON: 
"I was very surprised to receive the sad news of 
the sudden death of Earl. I am, of course, very 
pleased, as I am sure you are, that he had the 
opportunity to see Notre Dame. It u always sad 
when death comes so soon after retirement. I know-
there was much that he would have enjoyed in 
the associations with you and the pleasant attrac­
tions of Fort Lauderdale. He had a fine career 
and I suppose in a sense there is little to regret. 
However, the personal sense of loss is always 
strong." 
"DUTT" TOM GRIFFIN wrote a short letter: 
"John, I won't be able to make any of the games 
due to an upcoming European trip. \ynH definitely 
sec you at the June reunion." DUTT (from the

I had just a "hello" with BILL BELL and 
WARD McCARRON at the UCLA game. They 
had ordered their tickets for thb game instead of 
Purdue. Remember, fellows — from now on our 
"picnic" will be the opening home game, so order 
your tickets accordingly. (1965, Northwestern, Oct. 
2.) 

Your "Sec" made the Southern Cal game with 
three other couples and my wife. It was a good 
game despite the loss and a great season, too. We 
had a delightful visit with VER.NON "TEX " 
RICKARD on Friday before the game. Tex ar­
ranged for "our gang^' to sec what went on behind 
the scenes at 20th Century-Fox. Tex looks wonder­
ful and is happy in his work. 
L.\RRY CASEY came up with a great idea 
which is turning out to be the main theme of "Our 
Fortieth." He suggested we honor the *'I92S ROSE 
BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP TEAM." 
After a meeting of ^•our Class officers and JIM 
ARMSTRONG in October, followed up by many 
letters and phone calls, it was decided to do just 
that in a big way. 
First we plan to have a banquet honoring all the

From the Alumni Office: 
As Alumni Secretary JIM ARMSTRONG begins his 40th year of serncc on the campus, it looks as if it might be Ms busiest year also. On Dec 30 Jpm went to New York to be one of 24 alumni administrators from schools across the couotry to

TOM McAVOY CSC, on the committee for tlie ND Centennial of Science (see lead storj-) and welcome the Alumni Board and ND administration ofHcers to the First Alumni Workshop (sec editorial), about which youMl be hearing much in future issues. In January Jim also dashed up lo Chicago to address a meeting of college athletic business man­agers at the annual NCAA convention. And throughout this time he's given much thought to local arrangements for the 40-Year Reunion— a bang-up affair honoiing the 1925 Rose Bowl Irish, spearheaded by the Four Horsemen-
Speaking of the Horsemen, they continue to draw* more recognition, both individually and as a group, than any other quartet in histor>'—with the possible exception of the Beatles. The latest in a long line of personal aifards came to HARRY STUHLDREHER, former atlilctic dircctor-coach at Villano\'a and 'Wisconsin, now* a US Steel execu­tive, as Harry was voted the 1965 Stagg Award by the. American Football Coaches .Assn, Januar>' 12 in Chicago. Tlie award, a replica of the plaque presented to Coach Amos Alonzo Stagg at the 1939 coaches' meeting in Los Angeles for his 50 years of service, is designed "to perpetuate the example and influence of Amos Alonzo Stagg and is cronferred annually upon tlic individual, group or institution whose services have been outstanding in the advancement of the best interests of football." The plaque was accepted by Athletic Director ED KR.^USE *3t for ailing Harr>-, reported to be undergoing surgery* Jan. 15 in Pittsburgh.

A couple of deadlines have come and gone, and I have not been on the ball. Tlie pipeline of news has not been functioning is what I tell myself, but that is only half truth. 
At the Michigan Stale game I met MALCOLM KNAUS. He came down from Detroit for the game. He was with a group and it was game time, so there wasn't time to talk. Time has been good to him. Also at the Michigan State game I almost collided with LARRY KRIEGER. Larr>­had been real ill this past summer. It was good to see him looking so well again. A winning foot­ball team is powerful good medicine. 
RUDV GOEPFRICH is still my best source of news. I see him often and he usually has con­
tactcd ••aniL'onc in his travels in and out of the 
US. He had seen RAY DURST in Chicago; Ray 
is going to divide his time between Chicago and 
PhocnLx. JOHN RY.AN and Ona stopped to sec 
Rudy after one of the football games this fall. 
Rudy had a letter from TONY ROXAS of the 
Philippines. Tony's boy graduated from Notre 
Dame this past spring. 
DENNIS O'NEILL and Dorothy were in South

from California.

From tlic Alumni Office: One of the real "greats" of the '27 Class. THOMAS F. (RED) HE.ARDEN, who gained the same kind of preeminence in high school, profes­sional and small college football coaching that his late great teammate JOE BOL.\ND won in sports broadcasting, died December 27 in Green Bay, \Vis., where he had compiled much of his 30-year record as the most successful coach in Wisconsin history. Red folJoued JI.M.MY CROWLEY '25 as a star halfback and captain of Green Bay East High and then followed him to ND, where he understudied ^vitli the Rose Bowl champions of 1925 and ^v-as elected co-captain of tlie 1926 Irish with GENE (RED) EDWARDS. After graduation he alter­nated law practice with limited (by injury-) serv­ice with the Green Bay Packere and Chicago, starting his spectacular coaching career at Racine St. Catherine's High in 1930. In 13 years before WW II he compiled a high school record of 63-n>8. In seven years at East High he set state records witli victors* streaks of 32 and 20 games and an overall mark of 51-3-2. Tom took a Navy commission and was assistant coacfi for Iowa Prcflight's 17-2 record in 1943-44, preparing to take over as head coach when the season was cancelled at war's end. For the next 
M;vcn years he was head coach and athletic director at St. Norbert's College, starting out witli an 8-0 season and winding up 41-13, with three unbeaten-untied seasons and four Midland Conference cham­pionships. In the fifties he alternated as assistant coach of the Packers and the U. of Wisconsin, and evcrj-body expected him lo take over Green Bay when a stroke retired him in 1957. He continued to follow football until a second heart attack took him during the Christmas holida>'S. 
In his career Red liad a record of 126 wins, 24 losses and eight tics, with eight perfect seasons, another undefeated. SL\ with but one loss and only two losing years. Hb winning wax's were ascribed to firmness and perfectionism witli fundamentals, tempered by a wit and confidence that resembled those of his old mentor, KNUTE ROCKNE, ac­cording to the anecdotes about his eccentricities. He could sideline a player for cockiness or miss a victory* dinner to sec an old friend. During the season, as well as through Lent, he kept a Spartan routine of avoiding drinking or smoking and at­tending daily Mass. 
RED HE.ARDEN will continue to live in the memor>' and prayers of hb classmates, who send sincere condolences to his widow Marion, as welt as to the widows of classmates WILSON McD.-\DE, E.ARLE REX and GEORGE U'ALL.N'ER, also re­ported deceased in recent months.

NESSY for the outstanding work he has done as 
chiinnan of the Ohio Turnpike Commission since 
1949. The Cincinnati Enquirer, referring recently to 
the job Jim has done on expediting construction 
of Ohio Highway Int. 71. stated. "Soon, Mr. 
Shocknessy will have another nion mt-iit to his in­
dustry* and knack for getting things done, and Ohio 
will have another monument to selfless serx'ice to the

•According to the St. Mar>-'s College Holy Croa Courier, the widow of HENRY HASLEV is serving as a nutritionist at St. Joseph Hospital, Fort Wayne. Ind. Her daughter is at St. Mary's College. The Courier also reported that OSKAR RUST was given an honorary degree by Subiaco College in Arkansas. Incidentally, my fellow St. Mar>-'s College 1928 sec­retary in the Holy Cross Courier, Mary Du Brul Sayre. was good enough to comment in her column that I was "certainly eligible for alumni-columnist-of­all-time awards.*' Thanks, Mar>*, for those kind words from one ivlio lias done great work as class 5ecrclar>" for the St. Marj's Class of 1928. 
AUGIE GR/\MS called my attention to the fine announcement in the October issue of Fortune magazine of HOWIE PlLALIN's recent promotion to the presidcncj- of Field Enterprise5 Edicalional Corp.

CHARLES W. MULANEY '26 Drug Chain Exec from Vanishing Breed 
Charles Mulaney, whose name and ca­reer seem to typify the Notre Dame spirit, is one of that gallant dwindling band of professionals who proudly bear the ND de­gree in pharmacy — a degree not conferred by the Universit>- since the thirties. A Wal­green Drug Stores* vice-president since 1963, elected in December to the firm's Board of Directors, he is in charge of his company's purchasing, advertising, merchan­dising and physical distribution operations. 
Charlie j'oined Walgreen's 38 years ago in one of the chain's many Chicago stores. A registered pharmacist, he soon advanced to store manager and later held several dis­trict manager posts. In 1942 he came to the firm's Chicago headquarters where he 
•became director of merchandising, then buyer in Walgreen's purchasing division be­fore his election to vice-presidency. 
Mr. and Mrs. Mulaney — residents of Oak Park, III. — arc parents of four chil­dren., a son and three daughters: Charles Jr. (Chip), a sophomore at Oak Park's Fenwick High School; Eileen, a sophomore in business administration at Marquette University: Kathleen, a journalism graduate of Marquette: and Mar>- Jo Scholand, who holds a degree in medical technics from Marquette and who recently presented the Mulaneys with a granddaughter. 
For rela.xation, Charlie enjoys deep sea fishing off the coast of Florida; he's also an avid reader, particularly of financial publications. 
though Matt received his LL.B degree in '29, he was with our Class for four years. I last saw Matt at our 35-year reunion. Malt practiced law in Chicago. He is sur\ived by his wife and three children. Arrange­ments have been made for a Mass to be said for Matt b>' OJr Class since he always participated in our Class affairs. 
The following '28 men attended the Rockne Din­ner in Chicago on December 8: CHARLIE SCHUESSLER, JOHN RICIwVRD, JOHN LYONS. RAY MULLIG.AN, JOE DORAN, ED R.AFTER. JOE GRIFFIN, BOB WINTER, BILL H. MUR­

PHY, BERT KORZEN, JOHN CAVANAUGH. HOWARD PHAUN, ED McKEOWN, JIM AL­LAN, JOHN WOLF£ and BIIX DWYER. Bi& mentioned how much they missed MATT GUIXEN who alu-ays joined the '28 group - at prior affairs. Bill also reported that he had chats with JOE MOR« RISSEY, ED McGAULEY and JOE HILGER at the ^fichigan State game. BILL DWYER has a son who is a sophomore at Notre Dame. Bill is still vnth Raymond G. Hudson & Associates, advertising and merchandising, in Chicago. 
The Class of '28 was represented at the New Yoric Club dinner following Mass at the Cathedral on De­cember 8 by BERN CAREER, JOE KANE, JOHN .ANTUS, DR. JOE SULLIVAN, GEORGE CRON­GEYER and your Class secretary. JOHN HOYT '33, chainnan of the dinner program, spoke very highly of the Cbss of '28 and of the efforts of your secre­tary* to contribute to this column. Following the dinner, the '28 group was entertained by JOE KANE at his apartment. It was a wonderful ses* sion about our days on the campus, and many dasr­matcs Were mentioned including some from whom wc have not heard in a long^ time such as WALT U\YNE, JOHN BUSCHEMEYER, TOM WALSH. WILL.ARD WAGNER, BERNIE ZIPPER, JOHN and LARRY WINGERTER and JIM SEXTON. JOE KANE is still single, woib at Bellevue Hos­pital in New York City and has traveled extenuvely. 
The widow of TOM TRAUGHBER advised me that Tom was special assistant attorney general for the State of Minnesota at the time of his death and liad ser^'ed in that capacity for the past four years. Tom's son is a freshman tn the Institute of Technology, U. of Minnesota. 
Class President BERN G.ARBER contributed the following: "JOE BREIG has a second son attending John Carroll U., Cleveland. 
"Late in the football season DAN BRADLEY hoped ND would win as many Fulbrights and AVil­sons OS games. 
"ED QUINN, from that excellent class party Oct, 
17. turned over $63 to JOE LANGTON, our treas­urer, %%'ho reports a comfortable balance. On campus as head of the guidance and testing dept., Ed knows of no other class that sticks together as ours does. .•\ new hat lost by a '28 guest was traced by efficient Ed through five hands (or heads) and finally mailed to the owner. 
"JOHN FONTAN.A was so bu5>- re-elcctinj Sen­ator Young he could not attend our foottiall parly. JOHN IGOE reports after dinner with Fontana. Igoe is treasurer of Visitinc & Co., engineer-con­tractors of Columbus. 
"FILANK MEYER sent me a fine batch of photos taken at the party. Sec them in a future mailing. 
"Following the presidential elecuon, persistent JOE BR.ANNON sent me a tabloid on Johnson, etc, but I haven't felt low enough to read it. 
"GENE FARRELL sent word he would be at the Na\y game, but I failed to see him. Twenty-one '28 men arc listed in the NYC ND Directory, but many more arc in nearby New Jersey. 
"Early in -November TOM TRAUGHBER wrote me that his doctor would OK him for normal life about Nov. 10. He died on November 21, 1964, mih burial in Faribault, Minn." 
I u-as pleased to read that HOWARD PHALIN had been elected to the Lay Board of Trustees of the University of Notre Dame. I am certain that he will represent the Class of *28 well on the Board. In response to my letter of congratulations Howie wTOte that he had presented a set of the World Book Encyclopedia bound in ^vhite goatskin to Pope Paul VI. Bern Garber sa>-s it was during a private audience Nov. 14. Like other classmates and your Class Secretary who have visited the Notre Dame headquarters in Rome, Howie praised the great work being done there by VINCE McALOON. One room in the headquarters is furnished exactly like a room from Sorin Hall. 
JOHN B. BUSCHEMEYER, administrator of the LouisviDe General Hospital, wrote that TOM TRAUGHBER had called during the time JOHN was bedridden following a coronary. John was in California \'isiting his daughter and five grandchil­dren at the time of the ND-USC game, but did not attend as he cannot tnke much Gtcitcment. 
a\R L PETTERSCH advbed me of the death of his Notre Dame roommate, VINCENT STAGE of Dearborn, Mich., after a long illne.'s. Vince had been with the Detroit Edison Co. for many years as as­sistant to the manager of purchases. He was married in 1941 and has one daughter. He served in the Air Force as Lt. Col., Chief of Guided Missiles Branch in Washington, D.C, during World War II.

If yoj knew JOE NASH (deceased Sept. 8, 19f>4) 
— and who didn't? — you will be interested in this note from his son, FR. JOSEPH N.\SH OP '54. *'You inquired about father's last weeks with us. . . ­You know that he had been sick over a period of nine months, much of tliat time being confined to bed. He became increasingly bad during the last week of his life. On Labor Day mv brother ED (FR. EDWARD NASH OP '58) said Mass for him at home. Tliat afternoon I anointed him and later gave him Viaticum. He died about 2 .\M tliat night. We were with him tlicn. I doubt if •wc could have asked for any more from God insofar as any man can ordinarily expect in this life. But all this is only part of the consolation we had, for his funeral meant a great deal to us also. Perhaps HUGH DEVORE '34 could fill you in on that as he ^\-as tlierc. Several other ND men served as pallbearers, such as ED GARRITY, RAY HILLIARD, MIKE DEL.\NEY, EDMUND BRENN.^N, JACK ELDER, JOHN QUINN, all of whom were cither classmates or 
around his time." 
HAROLD J. MARSHALL of 20 Gedney ^Vay, Chappaqua, N.Y., died of cancer on Dec 2, 1964. Surviving arc his widow Edna Margaret, two sons, Lynn and Thomas, and a daughter, Mrs. Shirley Anne Gillliam.

Most of these structures %vcre of the gay con­temporary type with picture windows, flower gar­dens, bright paint, abundant chrome and occasionally an outdoor fountain. 
Harold had been a leader in state and national banking associations. He liad scr\'ed as state execu­tive secretary and on numerous national committees as well as being president of the national bank division. 
He had headed tlie United Fund of Northern Westchester and had been chairman of the lay ad­visory board of St. Agnes Hospital. He was a mem­ber of the president's committee at Notre Dame. The Class of '29 wish to add their sympathy and prayers to the many received by the family. 
JOSEPH W. LAUBER BS ARCH., 1121 Lecper .Ave., South Bend, v%'ho had been ill for some time, died Nov. 25, 1964. You may recall tliat Joe was at the Mayo Clinic at the time of our Class Reunion in June. For some time previous he Iiad been less active in his sheet metal business but had been an almost daily communicant at St. Joseph's Church with his v*ifc Agatha (sister of ERNIE WILHELM '27). Joe never tmmplained of his lot. We relay tlie sympathy of his classmates to his vnfe and daughters and ask that he remember us as well as his family from his new home, where there is no suffering. 
MATTHEW J. CULLEN LL.B'29 died in Octo­ber, 1964. His family resides at 2508 North Spauld­ing Ave,, Chicago, HI. Wc regret that we have this sad news to transmit to his classmates, who share in the grief of the family.

"It was with deep regret that I had to cliange my plans for making the 35th Reunion but that b the price you pay for working for a large corporation. One cannot always do as one would like!!! 
"I have read v\ith great interest the August-September issue of the Notre Dame ALUMNUS and I'm sorr>* to say I only recognize a few faces in the 1929 picture, such as TROTTER, HINKEL, COL­ANGELO, DORGAN, etc. Maybe it would be a good idea to send out in the next letter to the Class of *29 a Icft-to-right reading by TOW'S SO we could easily identify all of those In the picture. My eyes are not good enough to read the name badges on the picture. 
" I would like anyone in the Class of '29 who lives in the Bay Area to get in touch with me, as I would enjoy seeing them and reliving old times. My business address is 1700 Marina Boulevard, San Leandro — phone 483-3III. 
*'It is my plan now to be at the USC-Notrc Dame game on November 28 and I v«Il be staying wher­ever they have the Notre Dame Rally on Friday night. It has in the past alwa)-s been the Biltmore Hotel. You know if Notre Dame beats Stanford this Saturday and USC in November they could become the champs of the West Coast Conference. 
"Well, Larry, this Is rather lengthy, but let me again say I am honored to have been selected and will await information as to an>thing I can do to help promote any plans for the Class of '29." 
Some excerpts from a letter of BOB VOGEL­WEDE follow: "I'm sorrj- that pressure of business prevented my attendance at the Class Reunion. It was a keen disappointment to miss the opportunity to renew my association with my classmates. I did enjoy the after game get-together very much. 
"Sfy son Tom is a freshman at Notre Dame this year; he wants to be an engineer. My daughter Marianne is now a junior at St. Mary's . . . 
"It will be a pleasure to serve as Midwiest vice-president for the Class, with President JOE LENI­HAN and the rest. I will attempt to carry out my assignment." 
WILLARD C. FORTIER was reccndy elected president of the Vertical Turbine Pump Assn. at their meeting in New Orleans. Willard is president of US Pumps Inc. of Los Angeles, Calif. Wc can be assured that the annual engineering session, to be held in April in Yosemite Nadonal Park, will be well organized and successful. 
JAY WALZ AB'29 has been reporting to the New York Times from the Middle East, Turkey and Eg>-pt and recently from Ottawa. He filed an interesting story on the conflict between the French-and English-speaking factions and the demands of the French Canadians for "blllnguallsm." Some would like every stop sign also to say "Arretez." It is getung to the point, said one French speaker, that "they speak English even when they're asking us for mone>*." 
We had the pleasure of a visit v^itli your Class chapbin REV. OTIS WINCHESTER, 1770 Second St., Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, who was here for the Michigan State game. Father Otey bad planned to be here for the Stanford game but couldn't liave done better for a substitute. It was a truly great fall on the campus. More on this later.

Class of '30 Anniversary 35 REUNION—June 1M2-13 
'30 Dcvcre Plunkctt O'Shaughnessy Hall Notre Dame, Ind. 

This column Is one of several efforts being made prior to June, 1965, to arouse Interest in the 35­}-ear reunion of the Class of 1930. Several mailings will be sent to all Class members detailing the pro­gram for the Friday-Saturday- Sunday period of this 35tli annivcrsar>'. 
BOB HOLMES, who has shared his engineering talents all these years with Indiana Bell Tdephone, is the chairman of the local committee for the re­union. His co-workers are WALT LANGFORD, JOE RUPPE, DICK SULLIVAN, BUCK SLACK and PAUL FARMER. 
We have already submitted some requests to the Alumni Ofiice, and it seems likely that v\-c will be housed In Lyons Hall, and our Friday night Class dinner will be In the Morris Inn. 
One of the many priest-graduates of our Class will be asked to say the Mass for deceased members of the Class, held on Saturday morning. A memorial list of the deceased Class members will be prepared again and distributed to all the Class. 
The five-year period since our 35-year reunion has brought amazing clianges in the Unlversit>-. The great campaign of Challenge I and the ph>-sical changes It created, highlighted by the Memorial Library, are tremendous achievements of this half-decade. Returning alumni can see for themselves the new growth of the campus as it moves steadily east­vrard. 
Apart from the ph>'sical changes — but in large part generated by them — Is the nc%v spirit, new vitality that grips the whole University community. The new Library with its remarkable facilities was probably the greatest lift Imaginable for the students and faculty at Notre Dame. Improved student pro­ducdons — including the New Honor Code now In use — have contributed to this newer Notre Dame spirit. And the great performance of Coach Pai^ seghian and the football team added more to this growing sense of achievement that marks the I960's at Notre Dame. 
40 Notre Dame Alumnus, February-March^ 2965 
All of llicic things plus (he all-important desire just to >'ak with old classmates should provide plenty of incentive for a big attendance come June II-12-I3. 
In recent mail from '30 people, BUS REDGATE said he hoped to be able to attend the June con­clave. He sees TIM TOOMEY now and then so he is pretty well up to date on what gives here on the campus. 
CHET ASHMAN said he and JOHN aVRTIN '28 of Magnavox are tr>-ing lo organize an alumni club in the Morristown, Tenn., area. Chel will be at the reunion if the chair mnnufacturing business will per­mit at that time. 
JOHN RONEY of Pittsburgh is a rather frequent visitor on the campus, as his son is a student Iiere. John told of seeing many alumni here for the Mich­igan State weekend, including JOHN MORAN, JOHN QUINN, FR.\NK KERJES, JACK and DAN CANNON. JACK CANNON did a great Rock-takeoff in the prcgamc rally. JACK RONEY has tried to locate FR/\NK D.UTON and BILL KNAPP without success. But he will check in with ED SLICK and DR. EUGENE RAYMOND about their reunion intentions. John sent n clipping about the death of DAVE BARRY, notice of which is probably carried elsewhere in this issue. 
GUS BONDI will be on hand for the June re­union and saj-s he will bring along JOHN HEIL­KER. also from Cincinnati. DICK BLOOM, back in Oneida, N.Y., after three years in Ireland, will be on campus for the 35th gathering. He credited AL SHIPICASSE and TI.M TOOMEY with keeping hiui informed fully about Notre Dame while he u'as in Eire. 
FR.-\N MESSICK, now managing an Associates Investment office in Detroit (across from the North­land Shopping Center), sends words of encourage­ment to BOB HOLMES and the local committee. Fran headed up the arrangements for the 30-30 re­union in I960. We intend to use him as the chief consultant on the coming afTair. Since moving to Detroit and the Lake St. Clair area, Fmn has be­come a boating enthusiast with his 26-foot chris­craft and diploma from the U.S. Power Squadron class. 
TO.M >rcDOUGAL, still a judge in Antigo, Wis., was here for the June graduation of Ins son. Tom expects lo be on hand for the reunion. He plavs golf with GUS STANCE and LEN DON.VHUE but rarely sees any 1930 Clais members. 
JIM LEAHY of Tiffin, Ohio, u-as elected county engineer last fall. He \ras the only Democratic can­didate in a strongly Republican county to win elec­tion. Quite a tribute to his personal popularity. 
Our best correspondent in the Ohio art-a Is Mrs. J.\MES (Betty) LEAHY of Tiffin. With eight chil­dren, three grandchildren, work in the Girl Scouts, and activities in church and civic doings. I don't know how she finds time lo write us for the ALUM­NUS column. 
TIM TOOMEY wa-, on the campus for the meet­ing of the Alumni Board, October 15-17. He is now working for the Veterans* Administration in Albany, 
N.Y. He rcporled that TIM O'ROURKE had been very sick all Inst summer. .-Mso, he said that FR. JIM RIZER is nou- at St. Elirabeth's Parish in Richmond, Va. Tim has promised the local com­mittee a lot of help on reunion publicity, so his re­leases may be reaching you soon. 
MORT GOOD.MAN barely missed election to the prcsidcnc>' of the .-Mumni Association at the fall meeting. Mori's contribution on the Board has been ver\* valuable. We are hoping that Mort will be on hand for the reunion and will bring with him a sizable contingent from the West Coast. 
In this past year the ALUMNUS had lo report rc­gretfullv the death of these 1930 class members: DON SCHEITIG, JERRY PARKER, JOE APODACA and JOHN THOMAS. -AUo, we extend s\-mpathy to ART REYNIERS and BO RICHARDS whose fathers died in the past year. 
WALTER LANGFORD was director of training for the Peace Corps unit getting ready here last summer. LOU HASLEY is one of the two ND pro­fessors who arc with the fifty Notre Dame sopho­mores this year at Innsbruck, .Austria. 
Final word: Contact 1930 classmates in your area no:i\ and make travel plans for the 35th (June 11­12-13). From the Alumni Office: 
TIM TOOMEY lias started a second career in civil ser\'ice as a special claims agent for the Veter­ans' Administration. Tim is now living in Cohoes, N.Y.

Convention. He drove east with his wife and several 
of his children, who took advantage of their trip east 
and visited the World's Fair while Jim was wrapped 
up In the convention. He very kindly invited lu to 
the Iowa recepdon which preceded the Annual Bar 
Assn. Dinner. I understand that Ed is to be the next 
President of the Iowa Bar Assn., which is a compli­
ment to both Ed and to Notre Dame. 
At the Na\-y-Notre Dame game in Philadelphia we 
ran into CARLOS H. FR.4NK from Snyder, N.Y., 
and CHARLIE CONLEY of Havertown, Pa. CharUe

the U.S. Senate from the State of Pennsylvania. 
ED ECKERT was also at the game, but due to the 
large crowd it was difficult to reach him between 
halves for a visit. Ed went to Phlbdclphia early so 
that he could visit with his daughter Sally, who is 
married and now lives in Germantown area. 
BILL LYNCH reports tliat MARTY LINSKEY

FR. LLOYD TESKE writes that he said a Mass on October 1 at Sacred Heart Chuch for JIM SHEA, whose death had been previously reported. Father accompanied the team to Wisconsin and prob­ably it was his prayers and blessings tliat started the season off so wdl. He expected to visit with JIM GEREND while in Madison, but at the last minute Jim became hospitalized and they were unable to get together. We trust that Jim is now well on the road back to recovery. 
DICK MEADE's oldest son Richard was married recently in Portland. Ore. LEO CUMMINGS and JOHNNY ENGLISH journeyed down to California for the wedding.

TOM (Hempstead) WALSH, CLARENCE PICKARD. DOX LOP­KER. BOB SHIELDS, LUKE KELLY, JI^f PICK and DOX JACOBL Two hopefuls are: TOM LEOXARD and SPENCER WALTO.N. The last questionnaire was relumed by the family of JOHN LAGONI. A recent note from John's wife, Genc­\ieve, told us tliat John died back In 1961 — June 
4. No cause is given. To Mrs. Lagoni we extend our 
Class sjinpathy. And now to the vcr>* welcome letters. l.aic in Sep­
42 Notre Dame Alumnus, February-March, 
H. CLAY JOHNSON '32, president of the Insurance Information Institute, has been designated ''Man of the Year" in the property and liability insurance industr>-. Twice spotlighted (1947 and 1952), he is executive vice-president and general counsel of the Royal G!obe Insurance Co., as well as the unpaid mayor of Rye, N.Y. The national news­paper "Insurance World," which presents the award annually to the individual deemed to have contributed most to the field, described Clay as one of the in­dustry's most eloquent and forceful spokesmen, citing his efforts to build im­proved conmmnications between companies and agencies through face-to-face meetings and joint educational programs, as well as his reelection as head of the I.I.I., which he helped found in 1960. He has served on several national insurance committees, is a hospital trustee in Port Chester, N.Y., and a member of the Law Advisory Council at XD, where he also received one of his two degrees in law. 
temher one arrived from BOB FOX. (Congratula­tions on those six children and three grandchildren, Bob!) We felt right at home uith Bob's enclosures; he is associated with 'Tucson Green Valley" — .•Vrizona's $IOO-miIIion Retirement Community. Bob talks of It as a ''thrilling project In the GREEN desert." (Sounds wonderful, Robert — thanks for the invitation!) 
We jaid that we could identify wllji the Fox man's work — did wc tell you that your Scribe lias cliangrd jobs? .After 15 years in public housing, we moved to City Hall last April as the executive direc­tor of the Baltimore Commission on Problems of the Aging. It, too, Is a *'tlirilling*' experience, and wc are having a ball! 
Almost 30 years have passed along, and finally ART GREGORY came to life out in Denver. Late in Oc­tober he wrote about wanting to identify with our class — though he has always been considered part of the '36 crowd due to the BA-LL.B combina­tion course. Art has been practicing law In the home town for 20 years. 
An said he had visited with JOE GREGORY in ^tinneapolis recently. Thc>* were roommates for a year at ND and tlien Joe left for Creighton, eventu­ally joining up with the Jesuits. That makes two of our gang — JIM CORREG.-VN being the other in the Society. 
At the Air Force Academy game Art ran Into BILL COEN, formerly from Iowa but now living in Boulder, Colo. 
It was good to hear from yo-*. .Art. Welcome aboard — sec you next June at our 30th! ART DEMERS wrote us a note and enclosed a clipping from the Springfield Daily Xr:rs (Massa­
1965 
chusetts) of September 5. It told In banner headline 
of the death on the same day of J. FR.ANK 
AfURPHY. He died In his sleep of a coronary-. To 
his family, our sincere condolence. 
Art talked of meeting some of our crowd at a ^ 
football rally and getting the cold blank stare with 
a "Yes I remember a Demcrs—but. . . ." .\rl is 
sans hair (shaved the head 20 years ago and now it 
won*t grow back) and is an unknown person to his 
classmates. He suggests (and 'we like it) that each ' 
30-year reunionite liave a blown-up 30-ycar-old plc­
tmre pinned on his lapel with the caption: "This Is 
what I looked like!" 
How about It, Reunion Committee — can you ' 
arrange that with our old Home pictures? 
.Art is with .Artted Co. in Springfield, ^[ass.. where 
he has been associated for years (Prcs-Treas. back in ­
'60). He has a new home address — 10 Ridgeway 
Circle. (Incidentally, Art, when you arc at Bendbc 
again you will be uithin spitting distance of our 
sliack — call us!) 
LOU HRUBY sent us a letter and enclosed about 
60 pix of tlic 2jth Reunion. As he said — "Last " 
Sunday, In a rare California rain storm, I finally got 
to putting my photo records In order — and ^vaddya 
know, I found the prints! Negatives too? No! But 
we're still looking.*' Lou has names on the back of 
some, and we have been adding a tew more. Hope 
to have them on dlsplav next June. Thanks a million, 
Lou! 
We now have the unpleasant task of luting a num­ber of our men who \%*ill not be with us for our thirtieth due to death. We receive copies of letters ^ which the Alumni Office sends to families of the deceased. Please remember the following In vour prayers. To their loved ones wc send our Class .s>-mpathy. •'

GEORGE R. WENTWORTH '36 
In the Big Woods, a Big Winner 

The basketball Minutemen of Stearns High School in Millinocket, Me., are hav­ing another great season, but they'll prob­ably never recapture quite the same thrill as their first State Championship last year under the coaching of George Wentworth. 
Before receiving his BS in physical edu­cation at Notre Dame, George was on the x-arsity basketball and baseball teams for three years each and made his monogram each year in baseball as a shortstop. Going back to Maine, he started coaching in Fairfield and turned out teams in all sports for four years. He then moved to Milli­nocket and has been there ever since ex­cept for three fine years in the Navy Pre­flight program. Two of those years were spent at the University of Iowa, and he 
& I also were on the ND g>-mnastic exhibition team and we had some great times. 
THOMAS J. DUNN JR,, is dead. Just recelv-ed word from Alumni Assn. that Tom passed away Nov. 13, 1964. S>inp3thy to his widow and family.

His boy is a soph, at ND, and the giri enters college next )T. Mike, his irife & daughter traveled to London, Scotland and Ireland, visited hb birthplace in Gal­wtiy.

Better come to the next reunion and wc will fill you in with a lot of news or else get that Cen­tennial Press going and we will print more news from you in the ALUMNITS. 
ED EPLER, 3655 Monroe St., Gary, Ind.; mar­

1965 
managed to get to Notre Dame a couple of times. Meeting many old friends who were in the same program, he had oppor­tunities to go into college coaching but felt he wanted the high-school fun of build­ing his own material. 
Millinocket is a paper-mill town with one large mill owned by the Great Northern ­Paper Company, the largest newsprint com­pany in the United States. The fine schools there are isolated from the rest of the , worldly by many miles. The kids love sports, and George gives them plenty of action. Basketball is the main interest during the long winters. Steams is the "Notre Dame of Maine," the smallest school in the large school division. Their shortest trip is 75 miles, and they travel around 4,000 miles • each winter. 
Two years ago Stearns came in second in Maine, but fortunately the New England committee took two teams from Maine so they went to Boston and won their first ^ two games for another crack at the team that had beaten them for the Maine title. In an all-Maine final they won the game ­and the New England title. Last year they won all their games in Maine for the State Title and lost in Boston to St. Mary's, the eventual New England champs. This year they were undefeated up to January with twelve straight. In this section of Maine they had won 54 in a row. Overall they have ­won 380 while losing 136. 
George's wife, whom he married in 1938, is a teacher and went back to teaching ­five years ago. They have three boys: Jim, who is a senior at St. Anselm's College in Manchester, New Hampshire; Tom, a sen­ior at Stearns and a guard on the basket­ball team; and Joe, who is in the eighth grade. Tom has hopes of going to Notre Dame, and Joe is beginning to think about it. 
When people ask George why he has stayed ' up in the woods practically all his life, his answer is simple: "We like the to\vn, school, kids, and the virgin forest area in which we live has some of the finest , trout ponds in the world."

The office received a copy of a note from JOHN 
.MORAN to JOE WALDRON, probably forwarded 
to LARRY PALKOVIC, which we quote: 
"I'm still in public relations but my new affilia­
tion is director of public relation; for Nassau Hos­
pital, Mincola, N.Y. Nassau is Long Island's oldest 
voluntary' nonprofit hospital and is currently com­
pleting a $4 million building program. An interest­
ing sidelight is the fact that the executive director, 
Fred K. Fish, has a son currcndy an wnder­
graduate at Notre Dame. 
**Since it's the bane of class secretaries to usually 
be short of ncw^ I've got the following items to 
pass along to help alleviate the shortage. BUD 
GOLDMAN'S charming wife Eleanor visited with 
us last winter while in the East to see her folks. 
Bud is managing the Tucson, Arizona office of an 
expanding western advertising agcnc>', and is active 
witti the Tucson alumni club. Had lunch recently 
with JIM MacDEVITT '35 who is both a CPA 
and an attorney. Jim's office is just a few blocks 
from mine. Talked with ED NE.-\HER '37 (for­
merly '36) not so long ago. Ed is a Long Island 
resident who commutes daily to New York where 
he practices law with one of the larger legal firms 
whose name escapes me at the moment. 
"Saw AL PERRINE '41, Foundation director for 
New York, a number of times this spring and used 
his office on occasions when in the big city. A\ 
was eating, sleeping and talking little else but the 
Foundation's Challenge II program, and the w*ay 
he u'as tackling the job he may raise the entire 
quota by himself. In closing I'd like to hear from 
CLIFF BROWN and ANDY HUFNAGEL one of 
these da>-s."

Right after getting elected to the State Legisla­ture last November and fzarrying LBJ in along on my coattaiU, I received a bunch of questionnaire replies from local '38crs: LOUIS ANDERSON. Paducah's most famois export; DON FISHER, at whose mansion overiooking the St. Joseph Cote d* Azur we wound up the 25th reunion New Years eve, BOB DuBOIS. who commutes to his prrsi­dent's suite at the AMS Corp. in Elkhart when golfing weather is bad,- FRANK SCHAEFER, trim enough to teach lifcsaving to the Scouts last sum­mer; and JIM LAHEY. uliosc son Pit was .All-State tackle on the local Catholic High School team that won the state championship this fall. I don't know if they s"ddenly feared for their taxes or took pity on me. anyhow if it takes this to get those Who'5-Who-In-'33 questionnaires in. might have to run on a national ticket. Two ot^er ex-South Benders replied too: CHARLEY DUKE, no«- with Avis in New York, and TOM WUKO-ViTS from near Detroit, who has senior and frc'hmin sons at ND. Tom's old basketball team­mate JOHNNY MOIR was spotted at the Iowa game with his son by DON HICKEY, who also 
saw JOHN COTTINGHAM, who has son ^fichael pursuing excellence under the Dome. Old faithfuls also replied like JOHN GORMAN, vcep of City National Bank in Detroit with son James a frosh at ND; DICK SCANNELL from Fairfield.

New York, N.Y. 

We sincerely hope everyone ib planning for the big 25th in June, '65. The announced dates are June 11-12-13 so start planning now! Had a good questionnaire back from ERNIE TIMP.ANI whom you read about recently. Ernie has been working with penal and correction institutions for the past twenty years and in the Pacific Northwest for the past six, currently in Shelton, Wash. He is married and has eight children. Each institution builds an extra wing just for Ernie. La:t seen were ED KELLY, TONY POTEN2IANI, JACK BARRY, ANDY DE SIMON. Ernie is looking for%rard to the reunion and to seeing GERRY FLYNN and E.'\RL B.\GAN. A little help came from GEORGE WARD in Bay City, Mich. George is an accountant (CPA). married and has a family of five; George's oldest boy has alrcidy graduated from ND ('63). 
CLASS OF '41 "brass" is infiltrating the White Plains Squadron of the Air Force Reserve, with Lt. Col. Jim Spellman 
(left), Cbss secretary, recently supple­mented by 3 buddy, Maj. Richmond Mead. 
No excuse for not making the reunion from Bay City. George hopes to sec DAVE BERNARD and hopes he is well after the bojt with polio. Have a note from NORM BOURKE. These notes and questionnaires that come back with only vital statistics kill this column. However, at this point w-e*rc grateful for small favors. Norm is dean at Auburn Community College, Auburn, N.V., married and lias two young sons. Last seen were JOE BURNS and BOB SHEA. Norm actually was saving all the news for his ^isit to the campus in June, ' '65! 
Had luncli recently wiUi JOE CUMMINGS, who has been a partner with PMM, a national account­ing firm based here in NY for a number of years. Joe's oldest boy is now a frosh at ND. He recently saw TOM FORD, who is a topflight tax attorney and partner in one of the leading law firms here in the city. Tom has two sons at ND now. Speak­ing of sons, you should have read that PHIL SHERIDAN'S son was elected captain for next year's football team. This is a real clique between Sheridan and JOHN KELLY: among the tliree, they have two football captains. If Kelly comes up witli a son who makes it, the other 49 states will ask for a recount. We especially want to see those fellows in June who were not a\'ailable in I960. Be there. 
From the Alumni Ofiice: MAJ. GEN. JOHN P. HEXEBRY placed a wreath at the east door of Cantigny War Memorial museum during ceremonies for JOHN F. KENNEDY on the Col. Robert R. McCormick estate near Wheaton, 111.

A most blessed New Year belatedly, to all the Class. 
Yoar scribe has ver>* few* tidbits of ne\vs for dis­semination. Seems he has no correspondents around the country! How about a delayed New Year's resolution to write yout secretary once in a while? Well — I expect to send out another batch of dues bills within tlie next six mont/is. You who have paid fully will please disregard them; and you who have partly paid up can be thinking about the unpaid balance; and those many nonpayers can get caught up before we reach our 25th Reunion. Kindly refer to the ALUMNUS issues for the past tliree >'cats if your memories don't recollect what you have paid. With the help of AL PERRIXE and other '4Iers who keep in contact with me, I am formulating plans for the activity expected at our next get-together. We will Iwve some souvenir of the occasion. Also, with your concurrence, we will splurge a bit as we did at the 20ih. .Ml of tliosc who returned to the campus enjoyed them­selves. TOM DELLA has recovered from that illness tliat laid him low last winter. He is looking fon*-ard to 1966. Tom has a boy at Notre Dame in his first year, 
A realignment in the recoverj' units of the US Air Force Rcscn'c last summer resulted in our White Plains Squadron acquiring some additional personnel. Who should pop up but RICHIE ME.\D —Major Mead to you. Rich is with William R. Grace Co. here in New York. You will remember that Richie enthusiastically called me in the late summer of 1963 to report that a new child born to him and his wife made him the oldest father of the Class of '41. You can imagine his dismay when I told him that my son w*as bom just a little later than his, thus spoiling his distinction. Well, he has started speaking to me now that he is in my fiight. Rich thought it would be nice if we sent our picture in to the ALUMNUS to show the coun­tr>- that it had nothing to worry about with us in uniform (thank God for a strong Navy), so here it is. 
Another small bit of information about your secre­tary is his change of address. We have bought a house at 14 Deerfield Ave., Eastchester, N.Y., a few paces west of DR. BILL CLARK. In the area within hollering distance are other Notre Dame men such as JACK MURPHY (right next door to me); •^ an cx-pres. of the ND Qub of NY, BUD MULVEY, is two blocks aw^y, as is BOB FINK, the lawyer. I can start a club on my own street! So, class­mates, write me at either business or home ad­
48 Notre Dame Alumnus^ February-March, 1965 
dress. Your letters wiW be most appreciated by your fellow '4Iers. 
An intriguing note from WALT DESEL, who is of the Class of '42 but who is well known to many of us. Walt has started on a new venture, called "Flotsam-Fantasies." This involves the salvaging of driftwood and making abstract pieces of art from the raw wood. Walt's studio is located on Fire Island. He instituted the first "outdoor art show" in I96I. In addition he has had shows at Carnegie Recital Hall, various art galleries and the American Veterans shotfs. 
A request from your secretary* to remember all of our departed classmates in your prayers. Each year takes its toll, and wc never know when it will be our turn. Remember, too, BILL B.-\UM*s father, who passed on recently. Bill and his late father operated a business of long standing, one of the products being a blood-pressure instrument, an item used on most of us at one time or another. 
That is all for tins issue of the ALUMNUS. I hope you will make a Xcw Year's resolution to com­municate with your secretary.

was ever so watdiful of tliose two sons of Notre 
Dame, be ever more a protectress of their wives 
and families. As we approach middle age wc shall 
be experiencing this tragedy more and more, and 
Vet when it does occur there is a great loss and 
an irreplaceable void. 
A letter from faraway Nashua, N. H., arrived 
from JOE GALL. It brought more details on the 
death of TOMMY KERRIG.-VN, a terrific person 
and truly a great son of Notre Dame. Tom and 
Joe had been close friends wWIe they both lived 
in Youngstown. 
It \iras sad news also to hear of the death of the 
father of JOHN BAUM. "BLACK JOHN" 
MURPHY forwarded a copy of a letter he had sent 
John who lives in Brightu-aters, L. I. 
A regrettable and confusing situation exists. A 
change of address for JOSEPH C. Mc^fANUS JR. 
was received recently from the Alumni Office. 
When the records were checked, it was found that 
Joc*s name appears on the Class of '44 memorial 
card and on the list of deceased persons. The 
Alumni Office has no record of his dying. The 
new address given is 11 Lansing Road, Mt. Pleasant, 
So. Carolina. Let us hope the problem ivill be 
solved before the next column goes to press. 
PAUL COLI/VNNI has the most fabulous secre­tary, his wife Fran, whose note with news items of *44 Class members certainly was appreciated. Perhaps other wives could follox^- her lead. The "male" has been extremely poor in keeping the Secretary posted. 
Fran wrote that WALLY "MAX" ROGERS spent many hours, day and night, preparing for a gala ND gathering in Chicago. Undoubtedly, fel­low *44ers gave him their cver-loyal support. An­other Franagram stated that the ANGELO BERTELLIs and the ED DUNIGANs spent a week­end at ND registering and acclimating their re­spective sons in the freshman class. The Coliannis' daughter Is a sophomore at Miami U. (Ohio), while their son, a high-school junior, is a UTestling enthusiast. 
"BLACK JOHN" MURPHY has been a most faithful correspondent and his letters arc welcomed. The Murphys arranged a soiree when "RED JOHN" MURPHY and SteUa,'Wilmette, 111,, \-isited the Fair. The entire Class of *44 couldn't attend, but the ANDY BARBIEREs. ED DOWLINGs, JOHN DUFFYs, JACK KELLYs, BILL O'CONNORs, JACK SULLIVANs, and TON^ EARLEY imbibed 
Mahon was associate director of clinical 
research for the Upjohn Co. in Kalamazoo, 
Mich. During this time he was a member 
of the teaching staff of Borgess Hospital in 
that cit>*. 
Bom in Kalamazoo, Gil followed up his 
B.S. in chemistry at Notre Dame with grad­uate work and chemistry teaching at the University of Detroit. While studying for an 
M.S. in pharmacology at the U. of Michigan^ he held a fellowship from the U.S. Public Health Service as well as a pharmacology fellowship from the university. He remained at Michigan and later received his MJ5. there. 
Gil interned at St. Mary's Hospital in Grand Rapids, Mich., and took his resi­dency in internal medicine at the U. of Wisconsin Hospital. He also served as cap­tain in the U.S.A.F. and was assigned to the Lackland Air Force Base Hospital, San .A,ntonio, Tex. 
He taught medicine and endocrinology at the state universities of Louisiana and Wis-cousin and was a visiting physician at Char­ity Hospital in New Orleans. Gil was also on the staffs of Touro Infirmary and South-em Baptist Hospital in New Orleans. Diplomate of the American Board of In­ternal Medicine, he is also a fellow of the American College of Physicians and serves as secretar>'-general of the International Im­munopathology Symposia. 
Married and the father of three children, Gil resides with his wife and family at 1ft King's Hill Court, Summit, New Jersey. 
in pleasantries at the Cherry Valley Country Club. 
Previously Regional Veep JACK HUPF, Seattle, 
Wash., honored the Eastern Seaboard and brought 
Murph up to date on the Northwest area. 
Banker ED O'CONNOR enlightened "BLACK JOHN" on the art of cashing checks during^ the latter's stopover in Kansas City, Mo. BOB .\IETZLER and CRAIG \VHITAKER also had the good fortune to see the traveler who, en route home, paid a call on PAUL ^L\RIETTA in Tcrre Haute. 
It is appropriate to mention again our slogan, 
"Rise and Shine in '69." That date — June, 1969 
— will be the time of our very important 25th Reunion. It is not too early to begin making pbns. GEORGE B.ARISCILLO, our president, will be ever grateful for any suggestions. Meanwhile, ai a Lenten penance your secretary suggests that you pen him a few lines in order to supply him with ample material for the next 1944 Class news.

As the year 1964 passes by the ua>-sidc and 1965 gets into full siWng, I again appeal to the Class­mates of '46 for news, comments and any sug­gestions during this year which would tend to make this column interesting, enjojable and worthwhile reading. Kindly write citlier directly to me or to the Alumni Office and you can be well assured that your appreciative remarks will appear in the ensuing issue of the ALUMNUS. 
^Vhlle this may appear to be a bit premature I do wish to call to your attention that in 1966 twenty' years will have elapsed since good old graduation flay. In view of x\\\%, and although our Class may be considered small, lei's reveal that we not only have great spirit but big hearts by mak­ing evcr>' effort to aitcnd this a-surcd memorable 20th Class Reunion. I promise it will be a week­end you'll never forget. 
Why not take a few moments and sit dowm and ^vrite your Class a few lines?

A random ramble through the list of kc>- men in the University's Challenge II hustle reveals the names of BILL HASSETT as co-chainnan in S>'ra­cusc, N.Y., and JOHN MULLEN as alumni finger man in Toledo. There may be a few more I've missed, and undoubtedly many of our men are working in the ranks to make the worthy drive a success. 
CHRISTMAS POSTSCRIPTS A few of the Christmas messages we received " reminded us that even at such a joyous time life is tinged with sorrow. BOB MULCAHY wrote: *Thc last couple of .. years have been trying — on Jan. 17, 1963 my dad passed au-ay after a long illness, and on Jan. 18, 19&t my mother died suddenly. Please re­member them in your prayers. ... " And PHIL DELINCKE's widow. Dot, reveals her health is subpar in the wake of VlaVs death Atigusl before last. Their daughter Sharon, with • the natural ver\'c of youth, is in llth grade al­ready and is a varsity cheer leader at school. From far-off Pakistan, BROTHER IVAN DOLAN CSC reports a spate of systemat^cd pilferage of checks from envelopes to missioners, with indica­uons the dirty work is being done in East Coast "^ post offices. Rejoicing after the football team's wonderful season, he reveals "e%'en the missioners showed a lot more interest in the ND games than they have in the past few yean." There >*ou are, '^ ARA, you're the toast of Bengal too! And a surprise card from Elwra and TOM McGUIRE reveals they have transferred from Rio to Mexico City, presumably at the behest of Vick Farmaceutica S.A. So Tom continues to operatr south of the border . . . ay. there's the VapoRub. ^ 
YOUR MOVE Speaking of address changes, here are a few which seem lo be of special interest: LORD JIM GRIFFIN has abandoned his Mnn- "* hattan digs for a spot in scenic Stamford, Conn.. just up the Merrick Parkway from BustfcviUe. PAT McCULLOUGH has moved from Hunt­ington Creek Road in Atlanta, Ga., to River Valley Drive in Chesterfield, Mo.; there's a message in , there somewhere. LARRY LYNCH and HUGH SKIDMORE liave also jacked up the ^fissouri per capita via respective switches from Dallas and Palatine, III., to Kansas City. That old South Bender, LARRY REISTER, turn^ up in Tucson after a few years in Natick, Mass.. presumably still \rith John Hancock. Right? A personal memo: Visited with Frank Ham at the ND football banquet, Larry, and unashamed tears were shed over memories of the old UGS. JIM GOOLEY has taken the southern ro*.Hc. from Cranston, R.I., to Charlotte, N.C. And BILL HABERMANN has invaded Beloit, Wis., from Watertou-n, N.Y.

It's Chiistmas week and also the time to get 
another column together about the illustrious Class 
of 1948. I have been delaying this column hoping 
for some last-minute information but there is no 
use u-allJng any longer as it Is bte nou-, 
I am sure that everyone in the Class of *48 had 
that "old-time feeling" this fall as we watched, 
heard and read about the great team that rep­
resented us on the gridiron after the famine of 
the past few year^. It certainly was something that 
we were all pro:id to behold and it wtis a pleasure 
not to have to give the Xfonday morning f^xctise 
for what happened on Saturday. It sure was like 
old times, and it is for sure that it was a great 
surprise io all. We look fonrard to things being 
just as good next year and the year after that 
and so on just like we were used to in b>'gonc 
years. 
I was able to take in the Xa\y game at Phila­delphia and was pleased to run into a lot of old friends of the Class of M8 and also of other eras. Everjone had the feeling of confidence and the air of hope that this was going to be a great year, and it turned out that way with the Na\y helping our plan of success. Taking in the game with his son Jim Jr. was JI^f GORMAN, who is an as­sistant vice-president at the Chase Manhattan Bank in New York City. Now we can say for sure that t*t hai'c a **fr7cnd at Chase Manhattan," and ii is especially good to have one in the mortgage de­partment. DON BEGLEY, who is with Allied Chemical in New York Cit>*, also found time at the half to look around for old friends and tell them about his growing family which now numbers three ofTspring. 
BOB SATTI, who is practicing law in New London, Conn., told us that his family has grown since ^vc last saw him and that there arc now five youngsters. Lined up in a small formation was a Walsh Hall ROTC unit talking over the statistics of the game and family: BILL BRACKEN, BILL WADDINGTON, JACK KEARNY, TOM MUL­HERN, JACK GALLOWAY and their spouses. BART JOHNSON %va5 promenading about uith his six-inch Gold^vater button, looking real happy about the progress of the game and not feeling too confident about the following Tuesday. Talking with NEIL KELLY about his diet that has brought him down to 210, we both missed the opening touchdown of the second half. It wiis such an interesting diet that time passed faster than we realized. GEORGE OLVANEY spearheaded a group from Garden City, Long Island, and from all reports he lead them home after the game in a real blaze of glory. In this same group were TONY EARLEY and ED MURPHY who had just returned from Hong Kong. BUNKY REGAN was with his wife Bett>- and son Jack, along with LEO COSTEL­LO and his wife Rita. I made the trip to Phila­delphia with GENE DEAN, CHARLIE McNA-MAR A and our wives (each had one) and we partook of the tailgate luncheon in Ivy League st>-Ie. It was a great day for the Irish and good weather, and We are sorry that we did not get to sec many more of our Class ^vho were somewhere in the group of about 100,000 that filled the stadium. 
On a recent trip to Pittsburgh, GENE DEAN tells mc, he met DICK ELLIOTT, who is as­sistant sales manager for the Miller-Sfeteor Motor Car Di^ion of the Wayne Corp. Dick sells hearses, so if anyone is interested in having Dick 
The Spotlight projects its beam half­way 'round the world this issue to finger a Notre Dame man of many facets . . . teacher, school administrator, counselor, practical nurse, social worker, contractor, resettlement director, ambassador, giver and beggar of alms. In a word, a missionary, with three six-year ser\'ice stripes figurative­ly sewn to the sleeve of his threadbare white cassock. 
Brother Ivan recently completed the high school in the background at Biroi­dakuni in East Pakistan's Mymcnsingh dis­trict. By American standards, the job was dragged over much too long a span of years. But then American builders don't have to contend with the inevitable rainy season each year, floods in an area only 65 feet above sea level, white ant inva­sions, empty coffers, difficult>' in recruiting and paying laborers, and — just within the past year or so —- the terrified flight of the Garos across the border to Assam. 
Peace is returning to the land. Brother Ivan reports, but his school enrollment was 
"put them in the driver's scat" instead of the back door, thb is a good way to keep ahead of the Joneses next door. 
BILL BONWICH, our permanent reunion chair­man, writes that JACK DEE who is now a de­partment store scion from Bellfontaine, Ohio, was on a European buying trip last summer that took him to Rome, Florence, Genev-a, Madrid, London and Kiris. While in Paris be \ishcd with GEORGE BURNS and family. Jack was accompanied on this interesting trip by his wife Dorothy. Thanks for the news. Bill; alwaj-s glad to hear what you hear. 
Had a nice letter from GEORGE NEWITT, who is enjojing a very successlul legal career as a trade­mark and patent Iaw>cr with the firm of Bair, Free­man and Molinaire in Chicago. George writes that he is also joined by two other Notre Dame men in this firm, GEORGE McANDREWS and JIM CALLAHAN. 
A lengthy letter from TOM HIGGINS is a column in itself, and I am going to pick out all the high­lights of what he has to say about what he knows of what is going on with our brethren of the Class of '48. Tom begins by saying that the "pangs of conscience were beginning to get him" for not crooperating in sending in some information. (Don't any of ^-ou other guys have any conscience?)

down to 13 from 300 at semester time a year ago. "Every time I hear of one of my students returning, I either send for him or dash out to his village on my old motor­bike and drag him in to school . . . " 
By summer, more and more Garos had returned — "Unlike Job, they do not have even a heap to sit on ..." — and attend­ance had reached 150. 
"That's about where 1 was three or four years ago," Brother Ivan recalls. "Most of these kids cannot buy their books or pay their school fees. So I buy the books and pay the teachers, and hope and hope . . .** 
A native of Waterloo, Iowa, Brother Ivan is here featured in his own right and as a representative of Holy Cross missioners the world over whose material accomplishments are nil but whose spiritual wealth is incal­culable. 
With apologies to the Victory March-writing Brothers Shea and the prolific pamphleteer. Father John A. O'Brien: "What though the odds be great or small, God's eager fools will win over all!" 
Tom is now living in Detroit having moved from Rochester, N.Y., about two yeais ago, and he really wants anyone filming into Detroit to look him up. He is living in a huge house, and with hotel space shortages from time to time, etc., he wants everyone to feel welcome. Tom tells us that EMMETT O'NEILL is now in Plymouth Meeting, Pa., with Ball Band and BOB McLEMALE runs a pizza business in Mobile, Ala. In Detroit, Tom says, he has seen LOU SINGER who is ^t h Dictaphone, PAUL HUSSAR who is with Metro­politan Life, HERB COLEMAN with Diefaold Safe, and also JERRY WAYNE, JOHN PANELLI and JOE FLOOD. After coaching high-school football in the Detroit area, JOE FLOOD is now at St. Thomas College in St. PftuI, &Cnn., and as a re­sult of this move Tom Is beginning to make money playing golf because he no longer has to have LOU SINGER as a partner against Joe and his hand-picked partner. Tom would like to hear from BILL FERRICK and also LOU ALKL\SI. He also notes among his lost contacts JACK PARKER, MATT PINTAR, CHICK and DAVE SLATTERY. FRED NAGELE. So if any of you read this, you can send Tom an Easter card at his home address, 16830 Sunderland Road, Detroit, Mich., because he sounds anxious to hear from y'aU.

A recent feature noted Francis A. (Bill) Fink's 30 years as managing editor of the national weekly Our Sunday Visitor, in Huntington, Ind., in his 35 years since graduation, only incidentally mentioning his founding The Family Digest and other periodicals. The February issue of Catholic Home Messenger devoted its Catholic Press Month feature to the latter publication and its editor since 1957, Jack Fink. 
Oldest of Bill's si.x children. Jack took over the editorship of The Family Digest only four years after graduation and at 25 was probably the youngest editor of a major Catholic magazine. .-V family editor from a family of editors (his great-uncle and name­sake. Bishop John F. Noll, was found­er-editor of the Visitor), Jack has further enhanced his credentials with the family shown above (from left: Robert, 5; Therese, 1; Barbara, 7; Rcgina, 9; wife Marie, and Stephen, 4). 
Supervising nearly every aspect of the Digest from selection of material to the printed page. Jack can sec his own ideas reflected as few other editors are privileged to do. The balance between original ar­ticles and reprints from other magazines demands the reading of an astonishing variety of publications, both Catholic and secular — a duty which he particularly en­joys, feeling a compulsion to devour ever\* magazine the day it arrives. 
Every phase of family life is treated in articles ranging from entertainment to in­struction to inspiration. They may hymn the blessings of a large family or present the facts on the latest advancements in methods of permissible family limitation. But the most recurrent theme of the Digest is the

problems of youth, with never an issue lack­ing a piece directed to the parents of teen­agers. Experts like J. Edgar Hoover tackle themes like teen crime, sexual promiscuity, early marriage, unwed mothers, pornography, glue-sniffing and "p^P pills." -A Family Digest original, reprinted in Catholic Digest, resulted in the "adoption" of more than a thousand overseas orphans through the Fos­ter Parents Mission Club, including a Bur­mese girl sponsored by the Finks. 
Jack supplements his full-time duties as Digest editor by ser\'ing as account execu­tive for all the outside magazines printed by the OSV Press (14 at last count, including Catholic Digest). .An avid reader of Ameri­can and Church history, he recently wrote a book on .American churchmen who were also great patriots. Although his spare time is h'mited, he's active in Huntington's St. Mar)-'s Parish as president of CCD since 1958, an officer oi the Home-School .4ssn. and a charter commentator for the Dialogue Mass. Such varied community activity as the city Republican chairmanship, presidency of LaFontaine Country Club and leadership of the Huntington County United Fund won him the Htmtington Jaycees' Distin­guished Service Award in 1959. Presently he's a vice-president of the Chamber of Commerce and a director of the 1st National Bank of Huntington. 
With Marie (a Philadelphian and gradu­ate of Rosemont College, whom he met at a National Catholic Youth Convention and courted during -Air Force duty) and the five little Finks, Jack lives on a three-acre tract north of Huntington, where the family strives to fulfill the Digest ideal of com­munal work, prayer, study and play.

An' a Happy St. Patrick's Day to you! Speaking of St. Patrick, Patrick Joseph Beaudinc arrived about 4:00 am, Nov. 10, 1954. Mother and baby (me too) doing fine. We now have four, induding a "Pat and a Mike." Of course, Pat's arrix'al, a bit early, caused me to miss tlie ND-MSU game and a 14-year ambition to see the Irish whomp 'cm. 
Among some old books I found a Scholastic dated Nov. 9, 1951 and an artide by KEN ^fURPHY. How docs this strike you? "Morrisscy dominated play thro"ghout the first quarter. AVALSH and BELLIS5IMO ripped off gains of 40 and 38 >-artls, respectivdy. At the start of the 2nd qtr. a pcnalt>* set ^forrissey back to the 30, but in two plays BANDIERA had carried to the one-foot line and on the next play scored .. . a bad pitnt ended on the Lyons' 10 and two plays later BELLISSIMO reeled around end for the score. Quarterback MARTY VIETH converted for a 13-0 half-time score. . . . The game ended with end DON ZECH picking up 20 yds. on an end-around play." Final score 21-0, Morrissey over Lyons. The valiant Lyons team was paced bv GUY MXCINA, ED BURNS, BOB ADAMS and AL JANNETT. Mor­rissey's defense earned spcdal mention; they were led by DON ZECH, DON HOFFNLAN, BILL TILL, BILL MORLEY, CLEM MA^VICKE and MATT TADISCH. Anj-one rwneraber?

Class of '55 Anniversary 10 REUNION—June 11-12-13 
•E C Paul Fullmer 7344 N. Ridge Blvd. Caiicago, nL 

Get widi it, NOW! Make your plans no%v to attend the big, swinging tenth reunion. It's the bargain of the century. If you haven't made con­crete plans, do so today. Even the wife \rtll let you out for tliis event. The beer has been ordered and it looks like a record turnout on June 11-12-13. See you then! 
One of the guj-s who will arrive early and stay late is big JOE MADIGAN. He promises to bring along "some northern Ohio stalwarts" like TOM BOSSE and JIM SIEGER. He's looking for^vard to chewing the fat with his old roomie, TIM NOR­TON. Don't expect to get much sleep vi\\\\ Joe on the scene, but it \vi\\ be much fun. 
President DICK BURKE is anxious to sec a rec­ord turnout. He and his right arm for the reunion, GEORGE SHELTON, hope to contact each mem­ber of the Class before the reunion. Make it eas>­for them by sending in your rcsen-ation TODAY. 
ED FOX viZiS a year early arrinng for the re­union, but he managed to have a ball back in Chicago. "Ox " brought back his bride, Ellic, from LA for a couple of football games. (He picked the right year!) JERRV BRANSFIELD threw a small bash for Ed. Among those attending were JIM GRIFFIN, STEVE REBORA, DICK BEEMAN, BILL TICE and TOM HAYES. JOHN RYAN, who now is the father of six, also was on hand. Dr. John now has ofHces in two suburbs west of Chicago. 
JOFF FLVNN had a great idea — a class viclor>­party during and after the USC game. 'Well, it turned out to be a u*ake, but H% SUU managed to drink the beer that he and MIKE KELLY pro-Wded. Others on hand included NEAL HAL­LORAN, TOM CAREY, MARTY CULHANE, FRANK LOLLI, CHUCK DOHERTY, JACK GITS, DICK FEELEY, JERRY HILLSMAN, BILL KILLBERG and DICK COOK. MAX ROESLER drove up from Fort Wa>-ne for the party. The leading life insuiance salesman in Indiana, Max is the proud papa of four children. 
One of our group is becoming one of the most successful and most famous high school coaches in the country. JOE SASSAXO romped to another Chicago city championship as his Weber High School team blitzed the public league title holder. Joe's star halfback also won the Chicago Club's coveted Rockne Award. He was honored with a personal invitation from Ara and Moose to the football testimonial dinner at South Bend. In fact, we ended up as roommates at the Morris Inn that night as a Chicago contingent took over one wing. 
TOM PARSLEY also is having success in the coaching field. He had a good season at Marian Central Catholic in Woodstock, about 60 miles north­west of Chicago. 
I received a nice letter from CONNIE TRO­GOLO, tvho now lives at 275 Kennedy Rd., Faducah, Ky. Connie got married right after graduation and then went into the Na^-y. He joined the Hoc Supply Co. in 1957. Connie has tliree girls and one boy. He says that he will be on hand in June. I hope that about 500 others show up for tlie shindig. 
RANDY C\RLL is in his second year of com­munications engineering training at the Nai'al Academy's postgraduate school at Monterey, Calif. He and his wife MarihTi live in nearby Seaside. Sounds like a tough life!

After ordination he returns to St. Mary's, Kurscong, Darjeeling Dt., India, for the final yeir of theology. Mike asks that all of you remember him witli a special prayer as he prepares for a life in the missions.

TOM GRODON was the first guy to pay his dues for the Chicago Club in 1965, so I must mention his name. Tom's a sales engineer for Philips Electronics. He and his wife Elizabeth are getting ready to wove into a new home — 70 Kil­dare Lane, Deerfield, 111. 
DONALD J. MATTHEWS '55 Coupon Clipper, Vacht Cup Copper 

.•\s his degree in business administration suggests, Don Matthews was destined to ad­minister a phase of the family dock-loading business from 1 Broadway in New York, but his heart was always putting out to sea. While other boys' dreams might involve clip­ping coupons, his was to captain a clipper. 
Therefore it is not so strange that Don should console himself by excelling in a sport that has always bewildered landlubbers like Red Smith '27 — the world of schooner and ketch and yawl that is yachting — helping to put Vim and Weatherly beside Shamrock and Enterprise in the America's Cup Hall of Fame, and thereby inscribing the name Matthews indelibly in the roster that glitters with names like Lipton and Vanderbilt. 
It seems quite a jump to the sleek sloops of Long Island Sound from the catboats 
For those of you who sent a Christmas card and don't see it mentioned here, be patient! This column had a Dec. 15 deadline, so most of the cards missed the boat. We'll get you next time. If you didn't send a card, put me on the list for next year so that you check in at least once a year. 
SEE VOU AT THE REUNION!

The following from SR. GLADYS ANN GIVAN SL: "I received my MFA degree in sculpture from the Unlveisity of Colo., Aug. 22, 1964. I have had several 'one-man' shows and now liave three bronzes on display at the Fine Arts Center here in Colorado Springs, namely: *A Nun on a Bike,' 'A Nun on Skis' and 'Veronica's Veil.' 
of St. Joseph Lake, but Don's ambition was launched in just that way. From jour­nalism and dramatics at Georgetown Prep, reverting to his Oyster Bay upbringing, he turned sailor with a vengeance at Notre Dame, becoming secretary and commodore of the burgeoning ND Sailing Club and vice-commodore of the Midwest Collegiate Sailing Assn. Having cut his teeth on cargo with New York's Universal Terminal & Stevedoring Corp. during summer vaca­
tions,  he  sailed  into  maritime  transport  
early in  1955.  
Don's  nautical  aspirations  weren't  

drowned by freight contracts. Three years later he and his brother were sailing their classic yacht Vim in the queen of regattas. Their gallant bid for America's Cup won them more enthusiastic mention than the \vinner — furnishing a personal *'QED" to the axiom that a good loser, placing second, can finish first in the long run. 
Meanwhile Don had wooed and won an­other sailor. His bride Cindy shipped with the mnning crew in the 1959 Women's -N'ational Championship. For the next few years they sailed as much for fun as for trophies at the American Yacht Club, Rye, N.Y., but having been "bitten by the .America's Cup bug," Don was persuaded to sail aboard someone else's boat only to find himself a part of the winning team of Weatherly in the 1962 defense of the Cup. .•^fter his own heart-stopping try in '58, Don admits "it was quite an experience." 
With the teamwork that distinguishes sea­soned yachtsmen, Don and Cindy (home­ported on Turf Road in Rye) have produced their own crew of three girls and a boy — Tam (7), Kim (5), Sharon (1) and Brian 
(3) —but aren't doing much sailing these days. Since the kids are below the age limit for able-bodied seamen, the Matthews team has taken another tack: "swinging around .•\pawamis Golf Course trying to break 100." But the former commodore of the ND sailing team still follows the Irish fleet, whose aspiring salts have dominated the Midwest Regattas in recent years, and his fondest wish is to sec his latter-day ship­mates win the National Collegiate Sailing Championship even before Ara's Irish re­gain the undisputed football crown. 
"I am teaching art here at St. Mary's High School — and my address is 14 West Bijou, Colo­rado Springs, Colo. 80903."

was a "Scholastic" reporter and member of the track team. Before theolo^ he taught primarj- school children at various Indian missions. Fr. Duccy will complete his final year of theology before assign­ment to permanent mission work. 
finally dedded that, instead of complaining about thb and attempting to fix the blame on someone, it might be helpful if I and others would rather simply sit down and drop you a line once in a while. Since I just recently moved to the Cleveland area after spending a year in Washington, most of the information about 1956 Class members relates to tliose in the Washington area. For what it*s worth, here goes. 
"JIM KRAMER, chairman of our Senior Ball, is making a career of the Na\y and is presently stationed at the Patuxent N. ^ in Lexington Park, Md., some 50 miles from Washington. Jim is a Lt., has been flying throughout his na\'a] service 
CAPT. RALPH FICKLING '56 (right), much decorated navigation c^ccr in Viet Nam, receives a special certificate in Saigon for his participation in SEATO "Exercise Air Boon Choo" last year as a member of the US Air Force component of the training operation in Thailand. 
and b currently instructing pilots in multi-engine 
patrol aircraft. Jim and Pat have four girb, and 
have just about despaired of having a boy. Jim 
and I played a few rounds of golf last year, and 
our families were able to get together on several., 
enjoyable occasions. 
"JOHN STUHLDREHER b a government law­yer in Washington, working as a trial attorney with the Civil Aeronautics Board. John spent four years in the Na\y as a pilot, got out in I960, and -­then went to law school at the U. of California, graduating in 1963. He is married now and they . have one child. , 
(Ed. Note: Sympathy to son John, his family and hb brothers on the death of one of Notre Dame's immortab, HARRY STUHLDREHER *25, in January. JL) 
"FRANK McC.\RTHY b abo an attorney and has 3 most interesting job as minority clerk to the House Rules Committee. Frank appears to know just about evcr>'0nc in the Capitol building. He graduated from Georgetown U. law school, and lives with his wife and family in suburban Mar>'­land. 
"JOHN MURRAY b likewise a Iaw>er in Wash­ington, having graduated from ND Law Scliool. He was formerly with die tax diiision of the Justice Department but now practices with a private law firm doing tax %vork. TONY CASTORlN.\ is a patent Iaw>Tr in Washington. 
"PETE CANNON recently moved to the area after having lived in Minneapolis and Cleveland, and wc were able to get together for lunch before I left Washington. Pete b married, and works \vith a large firm advising businessmen on how to deal with the government. 

".Abo in the D.C. area are TOM FALCINELLl, in pri\'ate law practice in suburban Mar>iand after graduating from Georgetown U. law school. and DON BROPHY, ^vorking for a newspaper (I bch'evc) in the D.C. area. 
"As for myself, I spent over four years in the Na\y, the majority of ^vhich time I was in the submarine service, and got out in I960 to attend law scliool. I graduated from the U. of Michigan law scliool in 1963, ^vhcre I was cditor-in-cltief of the Michigan Law Review. I then spent a year in Washington as senior law clerk to Chief Justice Eari Warren during the 1963-64- term of the US Supreme Court. My wife Diane and I and our two children (Patrick and Kathleen) moved from Washington to Cleveland in late August — our ninth major move in the les than seven years we've been married. Needless to say, we hope to settle douTi for a while now. I'm associated with the large general corporate practice firm of Jones, Day, Cock­ley & Reavb here in Cleveland and recently passed the Ohio bar exam. , 
"Also with the same firm here b PAT McC.\R-^ TAN, rapidly making hb mark as a trial law>-er. Pat graduated from ND Law School in 1956, where he was editor-in-chief of the Notre Dame Laxcyer. He then clerked for Justice Whittaker at the US Supreme Court during the 1956-60 term, and there- r^ after commenced practice here in Cleveland. Pat and hb wife have two children and, like the Bey­taghs, live in Shaker Heights. 
" I also hope that others will sec fit to drop you a line, so that aU of us can be 'filled in' on as many of our classmates as b possible. See you at '^ the reunion in '66." Thanks, FR.-\NK BE\T.\GHI

With this issue, a new name appears at the begin­ning of our Class column. DENNY NEAD, who so -^ f:apably handled tlic news for these first five years, has stepped down. Denny and ifary Jo Utt were"*' ;^ married Oct. 24 in the Belbrmine Chapel of Xavier 
U. in Cincinnati. **Snead'* is still in the insurance business and found occasionally on the golf links. I am sure you join with me in thanking Denny for his fine w*ork for the Class and in wishing Sfary >^ Jo and him the best nf luck. 
I can see already the difliciilucs Denny met !n getting the Class column four times a year. I will merely repeat his plea that j-ou sit down after you finish this column and drop roe a few Jinrs 
^ bringing the Class up to date on where you are, what youVe been doing and the classmates youVc seen recently. Thanks. 
Being here in St. Louis should enable mc to see a lew of our classmates. I did spend a day y with JOHN "BUTCH" REARDON and talked to him recently. He is now finishing his courses for his ^^BA at Washington U. and is getting married in February*. The other St. Louisan IVe talked with '-Is PETE SALSICH. Pete is also a student, and is in his final year of law school. Seminary- Hfe in the past has been rather confining but the renewal , in the Church is also reaching the scminnries (yeah!) and I hope to sec more of Butch and Pete and the others in the remaining year and 
a half I will have here in the bicentennial city before my ordination. FR. DON SHOULBERG CSC was ordained in

CAPT. JAMES W. REULAND '59 (right) was awarded the Army Commendation 
Medal by Maj. Gen. Webster Anderson, 
commanding general of communications in 
Europe, at Orleans, France, for outstanding 
service in successively commanding mes­
sage, printing, records and personnel opera­

Speaking of the reunion brings back many mem­
ories, especially of LARRY WENT2 (my room­
mate for the weekend) trying to sell mc a life 
insurance policy. I haven't heard from Larry re­
cently, but JACK THOMAS told me that Larry 
and Lou Ann's latest addition was bom in the fall. 
JACK (JOHN R.) THO.\L\S (of Glee Club soloist 
fame) has retired from the Marines, and he and 
Pat arc living in Ann Arbor, ^fich. (1106 Norman 
Place). Jack is going back to the U. of Michigan 
for his MB.A, and they are expecting their first 
child soon. 
Some of you may remember that Pat Thomas 
is a sister to JOHN BEL1VE.\U. (Strange how 
Sorin Hall is responsible for so many romances, 
and even marriages!) John Beliveau says he has 
finished school for now. After A*D he went to 
Columbia for his MBA, then on to Georgetown 
Law for another degree. This writing finds John 
and his wife, Mar>', in the home town of Lewiston, 
Mc., engaged in the practice of law. Can you 
imagine haWng John and RAY GEIGER (editor 
of ''Farmer's .Almanac" and famous ND man) in 
the same town! 
Another Sorinitc, JACK McGRjVTH, and wife 
Mar>* Anne sent out announcements of the arrival 
of Moira Anne, bom Oct. 28, 1964. I thought the 
McGraths were still in Cleveland, but the postmark 
was somewhere in X.Y, state but had no return 
address. Jack, how 'bout some help on this? 
LOU KIGIN wrote last fall, explaining he had 
summer camp at the time of the reunion and 
couldn't make it back. His address in NYC is now 
3U E. 75th St. (Apt. 3-C). Lou sees JIM 
VAUGHEY occasionally in the city. Jim is in Im 
final year of theology at St. Joseph's Seminary, 
Dunwoodie, Yonkers 4, X.Y., and will be ordained 
to the priesthood on May 29. He will scr\-e in 
the Archdiocese of New York. 
PETE H.ACKETT now lives and works in Middle­
town, Ohio, my home town, where Pete is with a 
CP A firm. Haven't had a chance to get together 
u-ith Pete and Sandy as yet, but do know through 
phone convenations tliat their children, Kathleen. 
Kevin and Danny, arc doing well. JOHN NICHO­
DEMUS reports from Saginaw, ^lich., that he and 
Rose Marie have had a recent addition, Mary 
Elizabeth. She joins her sisters, Bridget and Lucy. 
Many of you have been following TO^t HAW­KINS' continued success with the Cincinnati Royals. I u:a5 able to take in the Hatv'ks-Ro}'al5 game the last time Cincy visited here and spent some time with Tom that afternoon. He sees quite a few of the class as he travels around the US. I guess my best bet would be to have him as my assistant. That's one way of finding out more about the great Class of *59.

Notre Dame Alumnus, February-March, 1965 63 
Office of the President, University of Notre Dame Alumni Association 
'  Dear Fellow Alumnus:  
''  "The  lane  is long,  someone  has said, that  never  turtu  again;  
And  fate,  though  fickle,  often  gives another  chance  to men  .. .  
"Oil,  somewhere  in  this favored  land  dark  clouds  may  hide  the  sun;  
And  somewhere  bands  no  longer  play  and  children  have  no  fun;  
And  somewhere  over  blighted  lives  there  hangs  a heavy  pall;  
But ND  hearts  are happy  now, for ARA  has the  ball."  
(Apology  to  Wilson's  "Casey's  Revenge")  

These are again die days of WIN and roses at Notre Dame. There is magic in the return to prominence of THE team which played with such flair, power and pride under brilliant coaching. Most significantly, the football success dispels the doubt that you can't have great teams and high academic standards. 
We welcome .-^ra, "Doc," Tom and Paul as the newest members of our Alumni Association and Monogram Club and believe they join an outstanding athletic department which will lead us into another golden sports era. 
The spotlight on sports draws our attention to the need of tlie-Athletic and Convocation Center. Ground will be broken ncvt spring. Regretfully, our pledges are not abreast of the building schedule. We are coming up to half time trailing and will need a real second effort to capitalize on the generous matching grant of the Ford Foundation. 
Many of die private colleges in our communities struggle to raise. OPERATING capital while we at Notre Dame have the opportunity for tlie greatest gro\yth in the school's history. Surprisingly, the Foundation pflSce records reveal adequate funds available in unworked pledge cards. We must help and help immediately. 
POINTING WITH PRIDE On the bright side, we learn tliat the 22nd Annual Alumni Fund e.\ceeded $2,000,000 for the first time in Notie­Dame's Alumni histor\-. 
Our initial "workshop" in Januarj' was directed at e.xploring the second hundred years of the Alumni Association beginning in 1968. We are enthusiastic as to the prospects of weaving the Continuing Education program into our tradi­tional Alumni activities. Oiir Alumni Secretary is a great one for pushing into imcharted areas and taxing the Board'r' capacity. This sense of discover}', together with talent and dedication, resulted in his and the Association's receiving Na­tional Alumni honors in 1964. 
Now if we can improve on Phil's 9-1 record. With best wishes to you and your families for health and happiness, I remain. 
Sincerely, LANCASTER SMITH '50 President
