ALUMNUS 
Vol. 22 OCTOBER. 1944 No. 7 
The "Sessions" Go On 

In uniform or out, in sunshine or "Indiana weather." year upon year. Notre Dame students hove their 
daily "sessions." This one was conducted by Brother \^cent Ferrer. C.S.C.. and seven of about 600 
civilian students now on the campus. The scene is. of course, the familiar steps of Carroll Hall. 
Kcture by Charles Renaud, 
but union with and possession of God. God won't be standing aloof from us, receiving our respectful praise and

adoration. He will unite Himself to us in the most inconceivably intimate manner 
: BT REV. JOHN P. LYNCH, CS.C, '25: 
—and remember He is infinite Power, 
"IS HEAVEN SO 'Hor" He was a freshman then, as he tossed that question at me a few years ago. Glum and frowning he was, just back from a week-end at home and dates with the girl. "You k n o w. Father," he ex­plained hesitat­ingly, "maybe I am a little here­tic but I've been wondering if heaven is so 'hot,' whether it can match up to the 
Fother Lynch 

Joys of this earth. For example, will we be just ilap­ping around up there in our angel clothes, just praising God, centering everything on Him? What I mean is, will we ignore our relatives and families and—?" 
"And the girl too?" we added, "be­cause that's the one you're really wor­rying about, isn't it?" 
"Oh," he mildly objected, "I wouldn't say that"—but his manner and his eyes said just that. 
"Sure, you'll know her, Bart," we as­sured him, "and get this: The happiest week-end imaginable here on earth is just the very tiniest, the very faintest, reflection of the joys of heaven. Those joys will be yours and the girl's if you make the grade. And you will, if you both continue the lives you're leading today. And think of this too, Bart—^there won't be any parting Sunday night. Your union with God and with her will be for keeps then, forever, everlasting." 
"Don't ever get the idea," we con­tinued, "that the ties and relationships of earth are blasted, severed or ignored in heaven. In fact, the ties and relation­ships are closer and happier, purged of all selfishness, jealovisy, boredom, quar­rels or fear of loss. That means that your love for her will be even-far greater in heaven, and hers for you too; likemse, your joy in each other's company will be immensely increased. That may not seem possible to you right now, but it's a fact. 
lUST A STARTER 

'•'Take thst immenrely increased love and joy as a starter for comparison— and it is just a starter," we advised Bart, "then multiply that imagined joy till your imagination stretches and almost bursts—and that's the joy that will be 
yours due to your seeing and possessing 
God—because your greatest joy and 
happiness will be in seeing God and 
being with him. 
"That's pretty hard to grasp. Padre, 
especially if you knew how much I love 
this girl." 
"Perhaps—unless you remember that any real goodness or beauty on this earth that thrills you, any such good­ness or beauty is a mere product of and reflection of goodness and beauty in God who is the very source and model of all lasting and real goodness. All creatures, everything in nature, were created by God to lead you to Him, to be used as steps leading you up to Him." 
"God created those things to lead us to Him, to be used to advance toward Him in accordance with His Will. 
"We're always acting to get happiness. We can't help it any more than we can help breathing. God made us that way. God alone has the power. God is our real and final good—^the only Person that can make us really happy. We'll see perfectly in heaven and mil realize that our greatest happiness is in possessing God Himself, infinite Power, infinite Wis­dom and infinite Love, the source and cause of all beauty and goodness or any­thing desirable. 
"Sin on earth is reaching out contrary to God's Will for something that we fool­ishly think will make us happy—and we are really reaching, as it were, for the reflection in the mirror and ignoring the real thing—God. Which do you really love-^the girl herself or her reflection in the mirror?" 
STUPID! "Sin is really being stupid then," mar­veled Bart, as he followed through. "Sure," was the answer, "the Saints are the happiest persons ever on earth because they are the smartest and also the greatest lovers. They've reached for the real thing—God. It costs them some­thing, sure, but they're not dumb and they're willing to pay for a good thing." 
GALLERY OR ORCHESTRA SEATS? "And the more they pay here on earth, the better seat they'll have, like in a theatre?" queried Bart. "You shouldn't picture heaven as a glorified theatre in which the blessed will sit around in endless rows, tier upon tier, gazing at the infinite beauty of God 
from a respectful distance. His love de­mands much greater intimacy than that. "Heaven is not the mere vision of God 
Wisdom and Love, inexhaustible beauty 
and supreme good. 
"Here's one quote, Bart, about heaven 
that I always like to keep at hand for 
questioners. Its from Bishop Vaughan's 
'lAfe Everlasting.' Discussing this union 
with God, he says it "is to be filled and 
flooded and wholly inebriated with, en­
trancing joy and gladness. It is to feel 
every fibre thrilling with exquisite joy 
and every nerve vibrating and pulsating 
with delight, throughout our whole 
being. It is to plunge and to lose our­
selves in a boundless sea of undreamed 
pleasures: to be engulfed in a bottom­
less ocean of ecstatic happiness—in 
short, it is in very truth to enter into 
the joy of the Lord." 
"WHY BE SO bUMBr 

"Then, why are we :so dumb," Bart 
asked, "that we go chasing after sinful 
things—pull 'the wine, %yomen and song' 
act and toss away heaven?" 
"Kemember the little catechism, Bart," 
we asked, "and what it said about orig­
inal sin darkening our intellect and 
weakening our will? There's your an­
swer. Original sin threw us into almost 
complete reverse and it took our elder 
Brother, Christ, to come down and show 
us the way to real happiness, God. 
"He knew how much heaven is worth. 
He didn't have any such question as 
yours—^"Is heaven so hot?" 
"He knew the answer! He as God had 
created heaven! He caihe down here and 
brought heaven for us because He knew 
it was worth so much. But we're still 
pretty dumb, Bart, pretty dumb and 
weak—and we grab at the mirror's 
image instead of the real thing." 
DONT TAKE OUR WORD 

'•Don't take our word for it. St. John 
describes heaven this way in the Apoca­
lypse— 
" 'And God will wipe away every tear 
from their eyes. And death shall be no 
more: nor shall there be mourning, nor 
crying, nor pain, any more, for all these 
things have passed away.' 
"Or take St. Paul who seemed never 
stumped for words. He could lyrically 
and thrillingly write on the deepest 
truths of faith. Yet when he came to 
describing heaven of which he had had 
a slight glimpse by a vision, he was just 
about stumped, finally saying this— 
" 'Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard nor hath it entered into the heart of '.man to dream what God has prepared 
for those who love Him.'"

Universal ND Communion Sunday-Dec. 10 
All Local Clubs Are Asked to Plan for This Ap­
propriate Observance of a Great Feast With Multiple Benefits for Our Alumni in This Year 
The Notre Dame Club of New York, in 1938 (on Dec. 11) under the leader­ship of Daniel J. O'Neil, '25, instituted an annual Communion Sunday, nearest the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. It was the hope of the Club then that the practice would spread to other clubs, so that this beautiful custom might be as universal as the Feast itself. 
In this thought the University and the Alumni Association heartily concurred. 
On Sunday morning, Dec. 7, 1941, Myron C. Taylor, President Roosevelt's personal representative at the Vatican, was addressing the fourth annual Com­munion Sunday breakfast of the New York Club, when news of Pearl Harbor broke over a startled America. 
Now, another Universal Communion Sunday will be observed, on Sunday, Dec. 10. Many of the young men who were listening to Myron Taylor three years ago are veterans of the subsequent years of war. No one who was listening to him then remains unaffected. 
Notre Dame Clubs have suffered from loss of leadership; loss of membership. Centralized direction of the Club pro­gram, through the Alumni Office, has suffered from the complexities of the war program. 
But there is every indication that our Blessed Lady, whose Feast has remained steadfast and who, under her title of the Immaculate Conception, is the patron­ess of the United States and the Armed Forces, has been with those who have loved her. Success, not without further sacrifice, seems in sight. 
This then is a year for a truly uni­versal Communion Sunday to seek her intercession. This is the year to thank her for blessings received; for successes won; for lives spared; for consolation in the greater sacrifices; to pray to her to intercede for a quick, just peace. . 
This is a year to assemble every Notre Dame man, who bears her name on his shield, to renew his participation in the perpetuation of the ideals he learned under her statue on the Dome. 

This is a year to bring together the families of Notre Dame men. Mothers and fathers are often glad to gather in a meeting where the son can not attend until the peace for which you will all pray is won. 
There are wives to whom this occasion would be a highlight in the weary and worried waiting through the leng:thening months. 
There are Notre Dame men already, back, some in civilian life, some in home assignments, some in hospitals, who can join you to bring vivid reasons for the Masses and prayers you will offer. 
No club is without its members in ser­vice for whom the Mass and its attend­ant communions and prayers should not be willingly offered. 
Thirty-seven clubs have gold stars on their membership rosters, in some in­stances a group of them. 
Most of the prisoners of war, most of the missing, are members of clubs. Their plight, and that of their families, cries for your full charily. 
The Communion Sunday is one of the most adaptable to war time conditions. There is no need for banquets. Most pas­tors will welcome the opportunity to co­operate in ofTering facilities to the Club for a central observance which will mini­mize transportation difSctilties. Break­fast can be as major or as minor a part of the occasion as facilities permit. 
Whatever the scope of your program, it is the Mass first, the communions and the prayers, and the other features as you can. 
But we want ALL CLUBS TO PAR­TICIPATE! DON'T LET YOUR CLUB FAIL! 

Father Michael Quinlan Dies 
Death took, on Aug. 29, a priest fa­miliar to generations of older alumni, the Rev. Michael A. Quinlan, A.B. '93, A.M.'97. One time the secretary of the Alumni Association (1908-09), Father Quinlan's interest in students and alum­ni was a stimulus to the reorganization of the Association toward its present status. 
As hall rector, prefect of discipline, and teacher, Father Quinlan was of the old school of stem but respected counsel­ors, who knew his boys, a friend to whom many of them turned in later years for continuing advice. 
Always a sports enthusiast. Father Quinlan had records of early Notre Dame sports which formed the basis for the first publication of such records in 1929. 
In his • later years, health interfered with his regular duties, and Father Quinlan joined the diocesan clergy in the Northwest where he exercised pas­toral duties in Chehalis, Wash., at the time of his death. Three brothers. Rev. James Quinlan, C.S.C, '08, John Quin­lan, '04, and Jerry Quinlan, and a sister, Mrs. Catherine Kelly, survive. 
Father Quinlan was returned to Notre Dame for burial, where Rev. James Quin­lan, C.S.C, celebrated the reqnion Mass. Rev. Michael Mulcaire, C.S.C, and Rev. James Mulcaire, cousins of Father Quin­lan, were deacon and sub-deacon, mid another cousin. Rev. William Craddick, C.S.C, was master of ceremonies. Two other cousins in religious life. Rev. James Carroll, of the Holy Ghost Fath­ers in Pittsburg, and Rev. Patrick J. Carroll, C.S.C, were in the sanctuary. 

The Notre Dame Al Usiti n u s 
Letter to Notre Dame Men from the Presicfenf of the University 
Dear Friends of Notre Dame: 
In accordance with the custom I inaugurated two years ago, I am presenting dirou^ the Alumnus a statement of die operations of the University so diat all who are interested may know Notre Dame's income and expenditures, which are typical of most privately-owned and operated schoob. The delay in publication b due to the innumerable demands made on our accounting office by representatives of different government agencies. The statement b printed In summary form and was prepared by Pearson and Dwyer, certified public accountants. 111 West Monroe Street Chicago, III. 
OPERATIONS FOB THE FISCAL YEAH ENDED MAY IS, 1943 
Received From tuitioii and student fees; U. S. Navy: interest on general endowment: retunu bom. scholoislups: and from oU auxiliary operations, including athletics __1__$4,585,S46.69 
Paid Out For the operation of all Colleges of the University—^Aits and letters, Sdence, Law. Engineering, and Com­
merce (incudlng administrative and faculty salaries, pensions) as well as opmrcitioa of the Graduate 
School: for interhall athletics, student activities, and publications: for operolion of rendence halls, din­
ing halls, infirmary, laundry, Bockne Memorial, golf course, and general maintenonce 4,575,989.63 
Net gmn from University and Auxiliary operations 9,957J)6 
Received From miscellaneous sources, exclusive of University and auxiliary operations (interest on investments, profits from sale of securities, bad debt recoveries, property rentals, etc.) 29,365.39 
Net credit to surplus (to be used for purchase of new laboratory, shop, classroom equipmenL additions to libraries, for research, graduate departments, etc.))__ 39,322.45 
If you recall die last operating statement I presented to you, you will note at once that the University's income has shown a very large increase, which, however, has been offset by a correspondingly large increase in expenditures. That b because during the fiscal year 1943 Notre Dame's schoolyear consbted of three semesters instead of die two diat were char­acteristic of pre-war years. Furthermore, our arrangement with the Navy b on a cost basis. Therefore, stepping up die tempo and maintaining a relatively good enrollment involved more intensive academic and auxiliary operations and larger sums of money but did not substantially widen die narrow margin between income and expense^ 
The entire surplus available for new equipment in laboratories, shop, and classrooms; for additional books and maga­zines in the General Library and in the libraries of the various departments of the University; for carrying on research projects already undertaken; for maintaining the Graduate School, and for die retitement program, b ^39,322.45, as com­pared with ^20,196.02 the year previous. 
If Notre Dame's progress b not to be seriously hampered in her contribution to the post-war, once a peace with jus­tice and charity has been establbhed, it b obvious diat she must have the continued—and increased—help of her friends. I have every reason to believe that such help will be forthcoming, and I base may hope on the experiences of the past few years. For example, more persons contributed to Notre Dame's unrestricted endowment funds in 1943 than in 1942; die number of donors was larger in 1942 than in 1941; and there were more in 1941 than in 1940. 
It b not enough to say that successive changes in federal income tax laws have provided an unusual opportunity to con­tribute to the support of privately-endowed colleges and universities, and that more taxpayers are taking advantage of the 15 per cent deductibility clause by making annual gifts. (Yet the per cent participation b still small). A more basic reason b ^a t more and more philanthropically dbposed persons realize die necessity of preserving die American tradition of education as a sound foundation upon which to build die future. 
It b a source of intense gratification to die adminbtration and faculty that so many alumni should be numbered in tfab group. I have already expressed my appreciation of the part they played lliroi]^ participation in the Centenary Fund, in making it possible for Notre Dame to continue undertakings which, without the support of the alumni, we would have had to suspend, or at least curtail, because of the war. The 1944 operating statement soon to be published, will illustrate a statement that I have made previously: that one of die brightest promises for Notte Dame's future b the growing realiza­tion among alumni and friends that their support b an essential part of Notre Dame's growth and development. 
In an early issue of the Alumnus I hope to tell you what b contemplated for the fiutuic, and to set forth in some de­tail how Notre Dame plans not only to carry on, but also to augment her services to God and Country thtoudi die edu­cation of American youth. Meanwhile, in the name of die Notre Dame of the future, I invite all diose y/ho are proud of what she has accomplbhed, and who can vbualize die great opportunities that lie ahead, U> contribute to Notre Dame's endowment fund, in any amount they see fit, in order that diey may share widi Notte I>ame die promise that the future holds for her. 
Yours very sincerely.

New Office of Veterans Affairs at N. D. 
By Rev. John L Lane, C. S. C, '30 
Director of the Office 

On June 17 of this year, within a few days after the President signed the Servicemen's Eeadjustment Act, giving the Veterans Administration au­thority ,to provide among other things educational -assistance to discharged veterans of this war, Father O'Donnell announced the establishment of an Office of Veterans Affairs to make and main­tain liaison on the one hand between the University and the Veterans Adminis­tration, and on the other hand between the University and returning service-
Organization: The work of the office is carried on by the Director of Veterans Affairs and clerical assistants. To con­sult with the Director of Veterans Af­fairs and to make recommendation con­cerning policies to the proper Universitj' officials an advisory committee on Veter­ans Affairs has been appointed. The committee consists of the Director of . Students' Accounts, and the Deans of the five colleges and the graduate school. 
Functions. 1. Liaison between the University and the State Director of Veterans Administration: The first func­tion of the Office of Veterans Affairs is to keep abreast of matters affecting the administration of the Veterans Reha­bilitation Act and the Servicemen's Read­justment Act through close contact with the State Director. It is also necessary to provide for him infonnation regard­ing the eligibility of veterans for ad­mission, certification of costs chargeable to the Veterans Administration, reports of the academic progress of each stu­dent, and recommendations concerning veterans' unsatisfactory work in studies or in discipline. 
2. Advising Veterans Concerning Ed­ucational Benefits: Generally service­men are aware of Public Law 16 of the 78th Congress, the Veterans Rehabili­tation Act, and Public Law 346 of the 78th Congress, the G. L Bill, which provides five hundred dollars an aca­demic year for tuition, books, supplies, and medical expenses, and subsistence at the rate of fifty dollars a month for single men and seventy-five dollars a month for men with dependents. A 
•large volume of correspondence results, 
however, concerning the specific appli­cations of the laws at Notre Dame. 
3. Evaluation of Previous Schoaling and of Off-Duty Studies While in Serv­ice: Although many of the veterans who have indicated their desire to attend Notre Dame on discharge from service are Notre Dame men whose studies were interrupted by the call to the Armed Forces, by far the greater number of inquiries come from stu­dents whose thoughts first turned to­ward higher education with the signing 
FATHER LANE 

of the G. I. Bill or who were by force of economic circumstances attending colleges nearer their homes. Practically all of them have had training of one kind or another in specialized training schools, or they have taken correspond­
ence courses for off-duty study under the auspices of the Armed Forces In­stitute or the cooperating colleges. Since the Academic Council of the Univer­sity has quite properly authorized the granting of credit for courses of this nature when they are an adequate sub­stitute for courses in our own program of studies for degrees, it becomes neces­sary to secure data concerning them and to give them provisional evalua­tion in terms of semester. I say "pro­visional evaluation" because these stu­dents will be required to demonstrate on examination given by the University satisfactory competence in the handling of college subject matter before accept­ance of credit is made final. 
4. Testing: One of the long-standing deficiencies in admissions procedures in universities and colleges has been reli­ance almost solely upon high school ac­ademic records for the admission and placement of students. Although we have not yet arrived at the point of being ready to require entrance examination of all students, we shall require general educational level tests and specific. achievement tests of veterans asking ad­vanced standing on the basis of know] • edge acquired other than in the resident courses of accredited colleges and uni­versities. 
Where in particular cases it seems desirable, the student may be asked to take, or he may himself ask to be given special aptitude and vocational place­ments tests. 
5. Guidance: Since its very beginning Notre Dame through its system of pre­fecting in residence halls and through personal contact between instructors and student has had a rather successful, but entirely informal, method of academic counseling and guidance. It served we'.I a good many generations of Notre Dame men and the present effort ta systema­tize and give orderly coatinu'ty to the g^uidance of each student is a recogni­tion of its nrerits rzther than a criticitm of its shortcom'ngs. 
With the hcpe, lheref:re, of render­ing more effective cur academic counsel­ing and taking advantage of well t ied and responsible techniques of guidance, the President has been asked to appoint as student counsellors several highly-qualified members of the faculty to as­sist the Director of Veteran Affairs in this particularly important phase of his work. These men will be relieved of a considensble portion of their class loads for this purpose. 
6. Per*onael Record Keeping: One of the concomitants of a successful coun­seling program is a rather complete and serviceable personnel record of the sub­jects of the counseling. The Office of Vet­erans Affairs will, in consequence, find it necessary to keep rather adequate per­sonnel flies for veterans returning to school under the Rehabilitation and the Readjustment Acts. Our records will be useful for occupational placement as well as academic guidance. 
P)rM*nt Status of Program: At pres­ent the number of servicemen at the University is not large. Twelve are now receiTing benefits under the Servieemoi's Readjustment Act, and about as many­

The Notre Dame Alumnus 
more have filed appb'cations which should be approved soon. 
Thirty-six veterans elegible for edu­cational benefits have been accepted for admission in the semester beginning Nov. 3 and 30 additional applications are be­ing considered. Only two applicants have resented such imsatisfactory records that their applications had to be rejected. 
ProipecU for tbe Future: During the brief period of six weeks during which the Office of Veterans Aifairs has been actually in operation, approximately five hundred inquiries of ser^ncemen concern­ing the University have_ been answered, and the mail grows hea^^er each day. This does not include letters from former students who simply indicate their inten­tion of returning to complete their courses. 

- Until these men have returned, or at least until they have indicated what kind of education or ti-aining they shall seek, there is no way of knowing what the precise impact their coming will make upon the colleges. 
This much I think can be said. That for the great majority of those who plan on coming to Notre Dame the measures thus far taken or enwsioned will with such slight modifications as experience may dictate prove adequate to doing a necessary work well and thoroughly. 

Whether we shall have facilities and staff to render further service to the vet­erans and the community at large by the offering of short terminal courses, even­ing courses, and special remedial courses for particular kinds of handicaps are matters to which a considerable amount of study must be given. 
We feel that we are at least well-started on a work of tremendous import­ance to our country and to Notre Dame, and we trust that with God's blessing we shall do it well. 

ERIC GILL PRESS DEDICATED 

The Eric Gill Press, a gift to Notre Dame Catholic Action students from a friend of the University, was formally dedicated in the Law Building on Sept. 
24. The blessing was by Rev. John J. Cavanaugh, C.S.C, vice-president. Rufus 
W. Rauch, professor of English, gave the dedication address and Rev. Louis J. Putz, C.S.C, explained the principles of Catholic Action. Harold Berliner, chief student-printer, presided. 
On the press, a small, Colt's Armory hand-fed machine, the Catholic Action students, under Mr. Berliner's direction, will produce a variety of printed matter. The idealism of Eric Gill—^"disinterested, unselfish work"—will prevail. 
Three C. S. C. Brothers Succumb 


N.D. CLUB OF ALASKA 

The Notre Dame Club of Alaska had its first meeting in Anchorage, with the following five present: Major Andrew McDonough, '19, Lt. John Regan, ex. '43, T/4 John Morrison, e.x. '30, Cpl. Thomas Higgins, '37, and Sgt. Paul Toland, '43. Capt. Charles O'Connor, '35, and CpL Kenneth "Red" Oberbruner, '40, had expected to be present but were detained. 
The next meeting was planned for Oct. 16 in the quarters of Major McDon­ough, with the major as host and chef de luxe. The secretary of the group is Paul Toland. Notre Dame men traveling through Ft. Richardson or through An­chorage can easily reach Paul at the 
M.P. station in Anchorage or through the Alaska Travel Control office there. 

ENGINEERS NEEDED 

Aeronautical engineers, mechanical en­gineers and electrical engineers are ur­gently needed by the Bureau of Aero­nautics, Navy Department, Rm. 3913, Aer-A-43-RRB, Washington 25, D.C. Those interested should communicate di­rectly with the Bureau. Positions open have good prospects for the post-war period. 

E.S.M.W.T. CLASSES START 

The 12th term of tuition-free engineer­ing, science and management war train­ing classes began at Notre Dame on Sept. 18. The present term includes a group of 35 courses, taught mostly at night on the campus and largely by members of the Notre Dame faculty. Rev. James J. Leahy, C.S.C, administra­tive assistant, is in charge of the classes. 
Since the spring of 1940, when the first series of defense training classes were conducted at the University, more than 7,000 students from 150 industries have participated in 250 courses. Special courses have also been conducted in indi­vidual war plants requesting them for their own employes. 
Lt. (jg) Frank J. Hanley, former teacher in the Art Department at Notre Dame, is now a veteran of all the am­phibious operations in the Mediterranean theater, participating most recently in the southern France invasion on Aug. 15. He is publications officer on the staff of Rear Admiral Frank J. Lowry, Jr., USN. 
Three prominent Brothers of the Con­gregation of Holy Cross were lost by death in recent months. 
Brother Anastatius, who entered the Order in 1926, and who, at the time of his death, was director of St. Joseph's farm, near Notre Dame, died on Aug. 22. He had taught in the Ohio public schools for many years before entering religious life. He also had taught at Cathedral High school in Indianapolis, and Reitz Memorial High in Evansville, as well as Sacred Heart CoUeg^e, Watertown. Bro­ther Anastatius was 64. 

Brother Howard Martin, C.S.C. (Mar­tin B. Coyne), A.B. 1941, died in New Orleans, on Sept. 24, at Holy Cross Col­lege where he was teaching. Death from an embolism followed an appendectomy. Brother Howard Martin was bom in Norwood, Mass., Oct. 18, 1907, and was received into the Brothers of Holy Cross on Aug. 15, 1939. He had just made his profession in August of 1943. 
Brother Aloysius, 66, for many years a familiar figure on the "thrones" of Brownson and Carroll Hall, died on Oct. 5 and was buried the following day in the Community cemetery after a solemn requiem mass celebrated by the Rev. J. Hugh O'Donnell, C.S.C. In failing health. Brother Aloysius had in the war years served as guest master at Corby Hall. Brother Aloysius was bom in Ireland and is survived by a sister and a brother, both in Croagh in that country. 

NEOPRENE IN RUSSIA 

Details of the manufacture of neo­prene synthetic rubber have been made available to the Soviet Union without charge "while Russia is at war with Germany," E. I. DuPont de Nemours & Co. announced, according to an AP dis­patch. 
The step, taken at the request of the 

U. S. government, is the first large-scale agreement of its kind to be announced. 
DuPont said neoprene, the first suc­cessful general purpose synthetic rubber, was developed by its chemists who based their work on "fundametnal research by the late Father Julius Nieuwland of Notre Dame University" and was an­nounced in 1931 and has been produced commercially since 1932. 
These members of the Vocational Committee and several guests met on Oct 6 in the lounge of the Rockne Memorial. Left to right sitting, are John T. Balie, '20, New York City: Thomas F. Byrne. '28, Cleveland: Bernard J. VoU. '17, South Bend: William C Schmitt '10, Portland. Ore„- Edward F. O'TooIe. '25, Chicago; and Joseph F. Donaldson. '23, Louisville.

Bill Fury is editor of "Notre Dame in Service." published by the Detroit Club for its members in service, and Henry Qoric is the president of the Detroit Club. Bill Costellini is manager of the civic affairs department of the Gncinnoti Chamber of Commerce. 


Vocational Committee Meets at N.D. Oct. 6 
Setting an amazing attendance record in these days of war stress, 10 of the 11 members of the Alumni Association's Vocational Committee came from coast to coast to meet at Notre Dame on Fri­day, Oct. 6 for an all-day discussion in the Rockne Memorial lounge. 
The only missing member of the com­mittee was Clyde E. Broussard, '13, who was detained in far-off Beaumont, Texas, by urgent business demands. Mr. Brous­sard, in a fine letter to the secretary of the committee, expressed his regrets and his vital interest in the Vocational Com­mittee's affairs. 
The names of the ten members of the conunittee who were present appear in the picture caption elsewhere on this page. 
Members of the committee were guests of Rev. Hugh O'Donnell, C.S.C, presi­dent of the University, at luncheon on Friday and Saturday and at the Tulane-Notre Dame game on Saturday. They gathered for dinner on Friday in the home of their chairman, Bernard J. Voll, and on Saturday evening in the home of the committee's secretary, William R. Dooley. 
On Friday morning the committee heard: a general report by Mr. Voll; a report by Mr. Dooley on the vocational questionnaires so far returned; a dis­cusssion by John F. McMahon of the many types of veterans' assistance of­fered by various governmental agencies; and a report by Rev. John J. Z^ane, C.S.C, on the Office of Veterans Affairs which has recently been organized in the University under his direction. 
Father O'Donnell and Rev. John J. Cavanaugh, C.S.C, vice-president, ad­dressed the committee at the Friday luncheon. Friday afternoon was given over to a general discussion of the ex­periences of the Alumni Association, and, particularly, of several clubs, in place­ment activity and to a detailed consider­ation of the committee's report to be made the Alumni Board. Edward F. O'Toole and John T. Balfe spoke on their alumni placement work in Chicago and New York City, respectively, and Daniel H. Young outlined some forms and methods in current use in industrial employment offices. Thomas F. Byrne, president of the Alumni Association, in his concluding remarks summed up the purposes of the committee and of the meeting. 
As the result of the meeting (deemed by all in attendance and by the Univer­sity to have met with exceptional suc­cess) the committee will make a compre­hensive report to the Alumni Board for consideration at the next Board meeting. The Board will then recommend to the University a plan of action for handling vocational matters, with particular ref­erence to the employment needs of war veterans. 
Mr. Dooley reported that, up to Oct. 5, 907 questionnaires had been returned, or approximately 20 per cent. He reported in addition: (1) Of the 907, 38 per cent of the men expressed a need for future job aid; 33 per cent said they probably would not need job aid, and 29 per cent expected to return to Notre Dame to school; (2) in general, those who have been graduated since 1940 will apparent­ly most need job assistance; (3) those recent non-graduates taken away from the campus for service in the armed forces will, in almost every case, return to finish their education; (4) those not specialized in certain fields (Le., those who are not engineers, accountants, etc.) are leaning in their work desires toward 
a) aviation, b) personnel work. 
The vocational questionnaires are still being returned in large numbers from aU parts of the world and a comprehen­sive tabulation of them will not be pos­sible for another couple of months.

Graduate School Is Reorganized 
Rev. Philip S. Moore, C. S. C, Is Appointed As First Dean 
After a consideration of a survey 
made by the Committee on Postwar 
Problems, the Rev. J. Hugh O'Donnell, 
C.S.C, president, on Aug. 22 announced 
the reorganization of the Graduate 
School. This important administrative 
change has been made, Father O'Don­
nell said, because of the I'apid develop­
ment of the Graduate School in pre­
war years, and in anticipation of even 
greater expansion in the postwar period. 
The reorganization, which consists of 
a dean and council supplanting the 
Committee on Graduate Study, becomes 
effective Sept. 1. The dean of the gi-ad­
uate school, according to Father O'Don­
nell's announcement, will be the Philip S. 
Moore, C.S.C, Ph.D., Arch. Pal., who 
has bsen secretary of the Comm'.ttee on 
Graduate Studies since 1934. 

The council will consist of Eev. Mat­thew J. Walsh, C.S.C, Ph.D., president EEV. PHILIP S. MOORE, C.S.C. of the University from 1922 to 1928; Eev. Thomas P. Irving, C.S.C, Ph.D., "'The war," said Father O'Donnell, Eev. Louis M. Kelley, C. S. C, Ph.D., "has naturally caused a great decrease Rev. William F.

Other members of the picture story committee include the Eev. Eugene P. Burke, C.S.C; J. Ar­thur Haley, director of public relations; and James E. Armstrong, alumni sec­retary. The committee is also making plans for an additional sound track in Spanish. 
Beginning with the founding of the University by the Eev. Edward F. Sorin, C.S.C, in 1842, the narrator will sketch the story of Notre Dame as the camera picks up campus spots of histor­ical significance. The picture will dwell largely on present-day phases of Uni­versity life but will include shots of the various Navj- programs now^ in progress at Notre Dame. It will be a historical record of the part that Notre Dame played in World War II. 
Charles T. Chapman of Evanston, 111., is cameraman for the project. Former nswsreel cameraman and reporter, he recently completed the stories of cam­pus life at Indiana, Michigan, and Ken­tuckv universities. 

A. C. S. MEETING IN N. Y. 

Efforts to repeat in New York the successful dinner meeting of Notre Dame alumni and faculty representatives at the American Chemical Society which marked the Cleveland convention of last spring, resulted in organized failure and impromptu success. 
As so frequently happens, setting up definite times and places that were mu­tually agreeable proved very difficult for the proposed sponsor of the meeting, the Notre Dame Club of New York, working with the University and the Convention officers. Eather than risk a real waste of Club effort, the projected meeting of 
N. D. men was officially called off. But a substantial delegation of alumni turned up at the meeting, and through the efforts of John T. Balfe, '20, director of the Alumni Association, and Frank Sowa, '30, brilliant young chemistry alumnus, an impromptu dinner was held in the Pennsylvania Hotel on Sept. 12. Nineteen persons attended the dinner. Thirteen N. D. alumni at the convention were unable to attend the dinner. These things we point out, because there is now no doubt of the desirability of these Notre Dame sections for all major conventions of any national group in which we have alumni representation. All Clubs can aid this development. Dr. K. N. Campbell was the Univer­
sity's faculty representative, presenting a paper before the Organic Division. 


Marines to Leave Notre Dame 
40 Per Cent Cut (n V-12 Quota Is Effective Nov. I 
Withdrawal of the Marine Corps de­tachment of the Navy V-12 school at Notre Dame will go into effect Nov. 1. 
Discontinuance of the Marine detach­ment is in line with the all-over reduc­tion of Navy V-12 programs in colleges throughout the country. The number of Navy V-12 students to continue studies at Notre Dame after the close of the present semester has been slashed 40 per cent, as previously announced. Marine trainees, who have not completed V-12 training by Nov. 1, will be transferred to other colleges. 
a^!^^ 
J 
MAJOR ERNEST W . JONES 
Now attending Notre Dame are 175 Marines, whose number has been gradu­ally reduced from the original 700 quota established when the V-12 program was initiated at the University, July 1, 1943. Major Ernest W. Jones, appointed in August as officer-in-charge of Marine training, will probably be reassigned when the program is discontinued Nov. 1, Major Jones succeeded Capt. John W. Finney who organized the Marine de­tachment at Notre Dame. 
In announcing the withdrawal of the Marine unit, the Rev. J. Hugh O'Donnell, C.S.C, president of the University, re­vealed a letter received from Lt. Gen. 
A. A. Vandegrift, USMC, stating: 
"The Marine Corps appreciates deeply the splendid work that your institution has done in the training of prospective Marine officers. It is hoped that the cor­dial relations between the University of Notre Dame and the Marine Corps will continue even though it has been found necessary to withdraw the Marine de­tachment from your University." 
Father O'Donnell, commenting on the Marine cutback, said: 
"Notre Dame will always cherish the memory of her happy and cordial rela­tionship with the United States Marine Corps during its participation in the V-12 program at the University. 
"Capt. Finney, Major Jones, and their associate officers, have endeared them­selves to all here, as upstanding Chris­tian gentlemen, faithful and true to the best tradition of the Marine Corps." 
Enrollment of navy V-12 students at Notre Dame assigned to continue studies after Nov. 1 will be restricted to 1,107. 
Included in the November quota will be 386 students in the basic course, 98 premedical students and 376 engineering students. In addition, 247 cadets in the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps will be stationed at the University. 
ANOTHER CLUB PRODUCES 
Many Local Clubs havs "closed for the duration." We have not argued the point that all Clubs have been seriously affected. Nor, frankly, have we been in a position to supply adequately the frat­ernal plasma, sulfa, penicillin, iron lung, or whatever the cases called for. 
But our strongest argument against the many unheard-from Clubs is the heroic group of Clubs that have not sur­rendered, that have held their ground. 
In fact, some clubs, like the Notre Dame Club of St. Louis, have counter-' attacked, strengthening their positions. 
A small item may slip your attention, but during the summer this St. Louis group was not only spurring the two major league ball clubs on to pennants and the intra-mural Series, but they established a $1,500 scholarship fund at Notre Dame for post-war use, and ac­companied it with the statement that this was only the beginning. 
Two hundred (200) members and fam­ilies attended the annual summer picnic. 
The annual award of the Rockne Mem­orial Trophy by the Club has continued, rewarding the outstanding high school football team in the area. 
A Club Retreat is in the offing. 
A football trip to the Illinois game un­der Club auspices has been arranged. 
Yes, the Club has felt the war. Of 190 members, half are in the service. But the other half have carried on so that the absent brothers will return to gained ground and a more alert Club than they left. 
It can be done. 

COOPERATIVE MEETING 
Members of the Catholic Committee celebrating the Rochdale Centennial co­operative movement begun in England in 1844, will meet at Notre Dame, Nov. 21, it was announced by Rev. Leo E. Ward, C.S.C, co-chairman of the event and professor of philosophy at Notre Dame. Working with Father Ward is the Rt. Rev. Msgr. Luigi G. ligutti.

LAETARE MEDALIST DIES 
Rev. James F. Connerton, C.S.C, reg­istrar, represented the University of Notre Dame at the funeral of Alfred E. Smith, 1929 Laetare medalist, on Oct. 7. At the same time. Rev. Hugh OT)onnell, C.S.C, president of the University, of­fered Mass here on the campus for the repose of Mr. Smith's soul. Later, Father O'Donnell issued the following state­ment: 
"Notre Dame will always remember her distinguished Laetare Medalist, Al­fred Emanuel Smith, for his fidelity to God and country. He came up the hard way and achieved success, but he never lost the human touch along the road to greatness. His tolerance and forbear­ance, firmly rooted in a Christlike char­ity, won for him the esteem and regard of all classes of society that had come to know and respect him for what he was —a true Catholic American. His noble soul will be generously remembered in the Masses and prayers of all at the 

. University. May he rest in peace!"

1944 Football Gets Under Way 
ConliaiT to the ancient traditions o{ the coaching craft, the 1944 football staff at Nelr* Dame smiles en masse for the photographer at the beginning of the season. This beaming delegation is composed, left to right, of Adam Welsh, Hnghie Devore, Jake Bine. Head Coach Ed McKeerer, Clem Crowe and Wally Ziemba. After this picture was token. Creighton IffiUer, extraordinary halfback of the 1943 team, was added to the stafi to assist McEeever in coaching the backs. Creighton will begin his law studies at Notre Dome ot the beginning of the next term in November. 
LATER 
For those in the far places who are pretty comjpletely "out of touch," the ALUMNUS is gratified to report here that Notre Dame beat Pitt, 58-0, and Tnlane, 26-0, in the first two games of the season. The first game was easy, be­f»use N.D. was able to profit from many Pitt mistakes, but the Tulane game was muiJi tougher than the score would in­dicate. Bob Kelly was, as anticipated, the "people's choice" in the backfield— unquestionably one of the outstanding stars of the season. He scored four touchdowns in the Pitt game. 
This little report is being written before the season gets under way, as BiU Dooley's fascinating publishing schedule necessitates my getting copy in to him some time before the ALUMNUS actually gets rolling on the presses. Because this is being written prior to the opening Idckoff, I am on the spot: if I make predictions, they may explode in my face. If I say that we are going to be good, we'll probably lose the first three games. If I say that we will have a very poor ball club, fate will have us winning the first few games by big scores. Maybe I'd better say we'll be poor. That will help solve McKeever's problems. 
After four weeks of summer drills, 

• and three and a half weeks of fall ses­sions, the picture is roughly this: Ed McKeever and his staff are still making first team changes, with the Pittsburgh game only three days away. That indi­cates that the team isn't ready, in spite of the long and arduous work done by the coaches. Then, too, if we are to have a successful season, there are many "IFS.'. 
IF Pat Filley's knees respond to treat­ments, and he can play regularly, our guard positions, now the weakest spot, will be strengthened. IF Frank Dance­wicz, number one quarterback, can con­tinue the amazing playing that he has sho\vn in fall workouts, our passing game and all around offense may be ade­quate. IF the promising freshmen and first year players progress as well as we all hope, we will have fair reserve strength. IF Bob Kelly's injured leg (he hasn't worked out for two weeks as this is written)) holds up, Notre Dame will probably have the best running and kicking back in the country. 
There are a few more "ifs" but there is the general idea. Ed McKeever believes we will have a typical Notre Dame team: aggressiveness, an abundance of team play and fine team spirit. That has been demonstrated already on the practice field. But he also faces the situation in the true light of facts. Navy, Army and Great Lakes probably carry too much manpower for Notre Dame to overcome, and we undoubtedly will stumble over 
obstacles in meeting our all-collegiate 
opposition. 
The squad roster, which you'll find nearby, will give you a comprehensive idea of our personnel and especially its youth and lack of experience. 
THE ARMy GAME AGAIN 
Once more, the Alumni and Athletic Offices have suffered from the increasing, traditional magnetism of the Notre Dame-Army football game. The sell-out for the general public this year came on Ang. 23. Alumni applications were re­ceived until Sept. 5. And by heroic meas­ures on Herb Jones' part, including in­ducing some early and farsighted fans to have their order for eight reduced to four, a few late alumni applications were received until Sept. 15. On the applica­tion blanks, by the way, in capital let­ters, that Sept. 15 date for preference is conditioned thus: "In case of sellouts, all preferences are cancelled." Lots of alumni missed that and wrote letters of a nature to elicit this reminder. 


LOOK AT THIS SCOREBOARD 
(Ed. Note: Notre Dame's endowment handicap, which is reflected largely in progress in research and the graduate school, is reflected in a few new figures of comparative endowments, taken from the World Almanac of 1944. The schools listed are just a few, varying in size and location and nature, but sharing with us the high educational objectives which de­mand substantial resources.)

ITALY 
Aug. 6. 1944 

The club continues to function although the exi­gencies of being in a country where a war is going on. in fact being a part of that very war, like the communiques—sometimes our lines of communication become very tenuous and some­what hazy. 
The last couple of months have seen us split up and fan out and only a few of the reliables are left. But most of us when we have time off climb out of our foxholes and hitchhike back to the certain spot that we call headquarters. 
Major John Hinkel, '29. has left and moved to larger fields. Sgt. Bemie Chenal continues to send those bombers into the sky from a nearhy^ airbase. Lt. Jim Rizer is also stationed there. 
There seems to be some argument as to whether Lt. Joe O'Connell, .'41. or Pvt. Johnny Lynch, '44. was the first N.P. man into Rome. As the dust clears away, we have to give the nod to Lynch; apparently all that separated them was a hair. Incidentally, nobody yet knows how O'CenncO got out of the infantry and into the Air Corps, nnch less himself. He is at a nearby airbase. Capt. 3bm MacDevitt. '35, of the now famed 88th Division, is still a hard man to find. His terse communiques reveal that he has uncovered half a dozen N.D. men in his drive north.

The N.D. Club of Italy undoubtedly is still hit­ting on all sixteen—this is just an indde tip that the Notre Dame Club of France is about to start functioning. I don't know how many of the boys are up north with General Bradley, but when we ioin forces we had ought to be getting in some returns. 
As far as I know "lighting Father" Barry was the first man to fait the beach down here mnd apparently I was second (and last so far). But he had the advantage. I claim, for he ^dn*t have to carry two, barracks bags, a three-blanket pack, gns mask, pistol, musette bag and camera. Be­sides. I hear he hardly got his feet wet.

Early on the evening set the guests began to arrive at the home of Mr. Wright. Mr. WriAt. for many years an amateur motion picture addict, received his goests, served refreshments, and then ushered them into his private theater.

Ed Bailey (what again!) was gold-bricking in the Abing­ton Hospital for a couple of days—wouldn't you think he could sleep at home? Oh, kidney stones! Anyhow, Ed has recuperated and is back on the job at Davidson Chemical in Baltimore. Dick Mc-Clore, recently made sergeant of police, has two prize-winning boxers (four paws each) who are taking as many blue ribbons as Pabst.

Football candidates are scarce here. 
Lt. Norman E. Dnke, '35, is stationed in France according to latest advices. President Hal Duke is biting his nails trying to get some compressors -from Wayne Pump. Did you know that Vince McNally, '27, is line coach at Holy Cross'! That Charley Donclierty is sen-ing faithfully at the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization here?

It is my painful duty to inform you that I have fallen heir to the job as secretary of the Notre Dame Club of St. Louis. This happsned at our last regular meeting, late in June, at which lime the following officers were elected: president. Jerome C Arnold; vice-president, Albert J. Rav­arino; treasurer, Loais C. Fehlig; secretarj-, Fred 
C. Weber. Jr. Since that meeting in June, the St. Louis Club has had its annual picnic at the farm of John L. Corley. In attendanca were ISO Notre Dame alumni and guests. Unfortunately, this year the greater prcportion of those in attendance v.-ere guests, as so many of our younger boys from the St. Louis Club are in military sen'ice. The picnic was. as usual, a success, principally because the refreshments were cold, the day was hot and the swimming was good. Roland Dames was chairman of the picnic committee, and vrns rssisted by Al 
Ravarino, Fred McNeill, Frank Amato and the officers of the club. 
A directors' meeting soon will formulate plans for our yearly program, which will include our scholarship fund, our annual Communion Break-fest. presentation of the Knute Rockne Trophy to the outstanding football team in St Louis, in ad­dition to our regular meetings.

ENSIGN PAUL J. KASHMEK 

his own safety, assisted skillfully in directing the fire-fighting activities and later donned a gas mask and went below; decks into smoke filled compartments to remove injured personnel trapped initial­ly by the flames. His unhesitating and self-sacrificing action in all probability contributed to the saving of several lives." 
Paul, one of the best known students of his day, was president of the campus Law Club. Taken from his law course for navy service, he was commissioned at Tower Hall in Chicago and was sent directly to North Africa. He is, as far as is now known, the first Notre Dame law student to he killed in World War

Speaking of Ed, John wrote: ". . . George Cop-pin, '43, had been talking to him just an hour before the accident. George went North while Ed was going South. Ed's brother, Stan, who has been in Honolulu for the past two years, had gone home for a reunion with Ed when he received the news of Ed's death. I expect George to write a letter giving more of the details."

The late Clete Lynch, '22, and hia wife. 
From Kid Ashe: Again it becomes our sad duty to record the death of a classmate. God in His wisdom has summoned Clete Lynch to his reward. Clete was one of the most enthusiastic and dynamic psrson­alities in the entire class; one whose loyalty to Notre Dame never wavered; an exceedingly gen­erous person v.'ho instantly resiwnded to every monetary appeal from the University: one who could take the hard knocks of life in a most 
graceful and carefree m&nner; one whose hearty laughter has gladdened the hearts of thousands. Clete was a traveling representative of the Lion 
Ribbon Co., of New York City. His work carried him thousands of miles away from home for months at a time. Divine Prov*idence called Clete from this life when he was visiting his old home 
in Meriden, Conn., on a vacation trip. Thus far messages of sympathy and sorrow have been received from Father James GaUacaa* C.S.C.. Father Georce Fisdier, C.S.C., Ji « Farcn. John Paul CtdKen, Dr. Dan Sextan, Kcnn Nyfcan, Jerome Dixon, Morcan Sheedy, Dan Yaaav, Ed Gottry* and Vince Pater. Our sympathy is extended to Mrs. Gertrude Lynch of Feoria. 111., wife of the deceased, also, to Clete's aged mother, and his sister. Dorotliy, in Meriden.

From Jalu Harley: Ben Kcsting broke the ice for the class of '25 and sent me some news of hinLself as well as of his classmates. I have been at Camp Patrick Henry, Va.. since the first of March and the only Notre Dame man I have ran across is L t ItmU 
J. Grassa, '35, who is with the Morale and Per­sonnel Service office here and is also the AniQr Emergency Belief officer on the post Louie and I get together quite often on our mutual interest in the welfare ot the soldier and his problems, both at home and on the post 
Capt Jae HciHaan, '21, wrote me a nice note from Camp Kilmer: his address is 720 X3.S.P., Camp Kilmer. N* Y. Joe is in and oat of this country on a hospital ship and is oversees at the present time. The Notre Dame prep school mem­bers of our class will remember Joe when he ran the newstand at the subway entrance of the Main Building. Joe later went to St Louis and received his medical degree and had a marvelous practice in Cleveland, but when the vrar broke out he an­swered our country's call for doctors. Joe was at Camp Patrick Henry Station Hospital for a while but by the time I learned of this he had been shipped out. 
I've been reporting on a man tnm other classes, but this is war and a Notre Dame man looks good to any of us, no matter what class he was in. Besides, the members of our class haven't been writing. Let's hear from you. 
Ben KestinK Is still the best county engineer Toledo ever had. He writes as follows: "I saw Charley Bieacli several weeks ago at Sandusky. He looks the same as ever and has as nrodt a chance of getting repair parts for his automobile business as v.-e do in Toledo. 
"I was at Notre Dame about a month ago vltit­ing the next generation. My son, Joe, graduated from Central Catholic High on June 9. He enlisted in the Navy V-5's on June 14 (our graduation an­ni\*ersary) and was ordered to report for duty on July 1 at Notre Dame He is living in 347 Alum­ni Hall and is doing very well; in fact he Is showing up the old num. I won't admit I'm get­ting old, bat it makes me realize that tlie years are creeping ui>. 
"While at Notre Dame I visited with Father Stetncr, Father Irviiv, Gcergc DriacaB. Gcai«c Kaluhack and Prat. Haran. They are all well and contented and it really seemed like old tines again. 
"I wish you all the luck in the world and hope we wake up one of these mornings and find out that my Nazi cousins decided they have had enough and quit causing so much trouble-" 
Ben added a P.S.: "I'm damn glad Fa didn't miss the boat when he left Germany!" 
Thanks, Ben, and let's hear from the rest of you "tired old men" of '25.

In answer to Vic Lcmmer's appeal for news in 
the last issue of the "Alumnus," Sid Bower came 
through -with a fine letter. "I've been on the De­
troit 'News' since 1929, on rewrite for about eight 

years. Married Nadine risher (South Bend) in 1930 
and. lo and behold, after nearly 13 years, to our 
pleasant astonishment, a daughter arrived on the 
first day of spring, 1943. So we're now a family 
happily engaged in -weathering this storm." 
Another welcome letter to Art Haley from Sgt. Don Halpint whose address is APO through San Francisco. Don inquired about the current where­abouts of Tony Boxas. He said, "it might come in handy, — sort of a reunion or something," for two members of the class of '26. Unfortunately, there has been no word of Tony since Manila fell. 
John Campbell, vice>president and secretary of the Hrst Trust Company, Albany, N. Y., stopped at the Alumni Office on SepL 25. He was in South Bend for a week-end with his brother, Dave, professor at N.D., and Dave's family. 
T^is is the latest—and a ver>* exciting bit it is —from Set. Chock Goinon of a Canadian tank out­fit: 
"Am still among the 'very much alive' category and am disgustingly healthy. Almost caught one for keeps the other night when I played midwife to a civilian. We were haWng our evening meal (just at dusk) up for\vard when a civie came in and told of his wife who was due to have a baby any minute. They were sleeping out in a field and so. big-hearted boob that I am, I grabbed a jeep and took out to find her. I discovered her about 500 yards off the road and carried her to the jeep and then asked -where the hospital was. The nearest one still standing was in No Man's Land where jerry patrols -were quite active after dark. 
"I had bit oS a bite more than I could chew so I prayed like hell and started off. I made the hospital under cover of darkness but when I came out. I discovered that jerry had a Spandau on the road -where I would have to return- So I went back in, and over a bottle of vino bianco dis­cussed -with the Italian doctor the types of prison camps jerry operates. 
"About an hour later things ssemed to have quieted xmd I ventured out. The coast was clear and I took out for home right smart I had near­ly cleared the town when they discovered the jeep and let go -with an 88 anti-tank gun. The shell luckily exploded on the wall overhead and all the shrapnel went over my head. The concus­aon crawled me out into the ditch -where I col­lected a good amount of the usual Italian debris that is dumped in such places. I came out of there UIK a flash and in two seconds Sat had the jeep beaded down the road in high. Upshot was three holes in the hood and the 'n-indshield completely out, frame and all. I tell you. Bill, I bear a charmed life. (I hope)."

From Lon Bnddey: I have written George Sdicaer, Larry CalBney, Charlie Short, Jdin LareUe and Pearl MM K asking that they send notes directly to you by Sept 18. I have the following notes to add to those you receive from my correspondents: Vince Carney wrote from Rochelle, III., where he is kept busy operating the Carney 4k Lonse­necker store and his wholesale sportswear com­pany. Vince has two daughters. He mentioned that his brother Paul. '31, is in India, a sur­
geon at the 20th General Hospital. Paul has three childroi awaiting his return to De Kalb. Vince sees Bed Lahey and PM I Fry once in a while in Dixon. 

Fatter Jim HcShane, S«I., sent a note from St. Louis, where he is with the Jesuit mission band. He mentioned that Jade Igoe stopped him in the Chicago locp recently. Father Jim also said that he had lunch with Bob HeUmnc and Bob Gra­lum in St. Louis. He sent along a letter from Ray Mo^, chief petty officer, located in Dickin­son, Texas. Prior to entering the service Ray was in social work in St. Paul. He was connected with the Navy's athletic program and is now assigned to the receiving unit. 
While on a field trip recently in southern Illi­nois, I had the pleasure of spending a day with Vince Walsh and his family in Honticello, 111. Vince has a boy who is a good prospect for N.D. Bin Kirwan and his family, which includes a boy and girl, were there also, so we had a great ses­sion. Bill is manager of the Montgomery Ward store in Iowa City, la. 
I was in South Bend the day the St. Joseph Valley Club was holding its annual golf day. This gave me the opportunity to see a number of '28 men, including Andy Boyle, Bon Bich, Bob Grant, and Floyd Searcr. Someone mentioned that my old roommate. Willard Wagner, is now with the FBI in South Bend. One of my students at Catholic University reported that Joe Langton is now located in St. Louis. 
Pearl Hoore flashed through the following from Box 75. Grampian, Pa.: 
•*It will be difficult for me to give recent news of the *28 men as I haven't seen or heard from any of them for some time. I did meet Tom Byrne and various N. D. men at the Navy game in Cleveland last year. On a visit to Clearfield, Fa., about six months ago, I talked with John Leit­ztncer who is now. to put it mildly, a stout, gen­ial merchant, the father of many future N. D. men. He is probably in the service at this time as he was planning to go then. 
"I learned from John that Phil Lytle is a cap­tain with the Corps of Engineers and stationed at Fort Belvoir, Va., and that Qoentin WUdeman has been doing O.K. as an employee of the R and P Coal Company at Indiana. Pa. As for my­self. I have been working as a construction engi' neer for years and have never been able to stay in one place long enough to get settled! 
"^i s is about the limit of my news. I hope it contributes a little to the '28 column which I al­ways enjoy reading. I look forward to a few notes by John Faran, Ernest Reidcr, Tom and Ray Bor. Laais Carr, and others of Prof. Benitz's 
H. E. class of '28. Hope to see you and many other N. D. men at the Navy game in Baltimore this Nov. 4." 
From Geerce Sdwaer, Chicago, to Loa Buckley: 
"Asking me for news of *28 men usually puts me on the spot because I hear from so few of them, a total of four in the past year: Bemie Gather, Gearre Kelley, Robert Grant and Earl Daides. 
"Saw Earl and his wife. Hargaret, in l^tus­ville. Pa-, this summer. He is operating a photo studio and free lance news picture service there and recently managed to wangle enough priority to get some new equipment. They have purchased an old rambling house that once belonged to Col. Drake (driller of the first oil well) and Earl has been busy converting one room into a studio and another in to a darkroom. 
"In a note for "The Ex News-Times.' Kelley told of buying a house at 47 Pinehurst Drive, Yoangstown. O. ReprescnUtive Grant, who quali­fies for the *Ex News-'Kmes' by havins played in 'News-Times' newsboys' band, wrote to renew his subscription* 
"Eve and I have been doing some househunting too, without much luck. Our three boys, Nick, Martin and Paul, do not take to apartment life so we are searchinB the suburbs. Ibey keep us pretty busy. A little CAP flying and publication of 'The Ex N-T is about all I get done, aside from working in the feature department at the 'Chicago Sun.* 
"I'd still like to know what became of Bob Capesiiu. If anyone knows where he went after 1938, when he was in West Virginia, I'd appre-. ciate a card." 
Lt. (sc) Jim Cnllen, Sayre, Fa., is stationed at a base on the island of Curacao off South Amer­ica, where he has been named executive officer of the naval base there. A former attorney, Jim has been in the Navy since October, 1942.

From Gns Bondi comes the following: 
"Received your 'Help Wanted Card* for news about our class in and around Indianapolis- This is a pretty tough assignment, because John Rocap and myself are the only members of that great class that live in Indianapolis. 
"John is so busy with his law practice and trying to raise three children that I very seldom see him except at Notre Dame alumnS functions. Last week our local club had its annual golf tournament and dinner, so we had an interesting session at the '19th' hole. Jim Armstrong, Art Haley and Adam Walsh were down ttom school and showed the film 'Highlights of the 1943 Foot­ball Season.* 

"Word comes to me that Clarence 'Oaaie' Ita»­ovan, the former mayor of Bedford. Ind.. is m captain in the Air Force somewhere in Italy. Jvk Cannon was supposed to have been at Camp Atterbury. which is about 40 miles south of us. but it can hardly be true, for I am sure the dti­zens of Indianapolis would certainly have heard his booming voice even from that distance. 
"Nothing new to report on myself. Still in the life insurance business with the Metropolitan, managing a district office and trying to get my agents to sell more life insurance so my company can buy more government bonds." 
Dick Bloom writes from Sherrill. N. Y., where he is located as sales manager of Wm. A. Rogers. Ltd., that he has not run across any of our class­mates in his extensive travels but hopes to see some of the boys at the Army game in New York this fall. I likewise, Dick, am going to try and make that game, renew old acquaintances and se­cure some news for this column. 
Our old friend Hadrian Hanske writes also. He is assistant advertising manager with Hardware Mutuals at Stevens Point. Wis. He advises: 
"Since 1930 I've been continuously in advertis­ing and printing. Am now with Hardware Mu­tuals. handling publications and sales promotion. Grace, my wife, and I have a little four-year-old blonde named Mary, a littie house on a half-acre on the outskirts and a more or less wild garden. 
"Haven't heard from Ted Ryan, BUI Clear. Ed Yorke, Bill Sherman and others for too long, but hope to read about them in the 'Alumnus.'" 
How about the above named sending me s(Hne­thing so Had's wish will be fulfilled? 
After writing to Larry Enright at Deerfield, III.. I was surprised to receive a letter from him recently postmarked Boston. Larry is district manager for Dictaphone at that point. Re says: 
"Since we moved here, we had two 1930 alum­ni going through the U. S. Navy Supply Sdiool at Babson Park. Mass., which is located only about three miles from where we live and we had the pleasure of having these fellows in at our house a number of times during their stay. The first one to come through was my old roommate. Norm Lillig, and a short time after he finished, came Jim McDonald of Chicago and Glenview. 
III. I believe that Norm is still stationed at Bay­onne, N. J. He told me the last time I saw him that he heard from Frank Amat» in St. Louis and that Frank was sttll with Harvester there. 
**Lt. Bob Knox is stationed at the TT. 3. Naval Ammunition Depot at Hingharo, Mass-, and v e have been his guests several times for dinner at the BOQ. He has also been out to our home sev­eral times. 
"Pat Tofnri, whose home is in Winchester. Mass.. is in the field service of the American Bed Gross at the Fargo Barracks in South Boston and he drops in quite often. As a matter of fact, he was in the office just yesterday and said that his new daughter, bom two months ago. is getting along fine. 
"The last time I heard from Gordy Lawlar he was going through boot training at Great Lakes and I wrote a long letter to him but have not heard from him since, so I do not know where he is stationed now."

At that moment I was eaaly the proudest man in the room. The andienee was in­formal, no pomp or ceremony and the Pope was very fnendly. thon^ obviously quite tiled.

From Lt. (jg) Tiffhe Woods: I have not got much nev.-s for you except the enclosed letter from C. A. Stalcj', which is good enough to be passed along just as it is. I am here at Princeton for Indoctrination and hope to stay here for the Allied Military Govern­ment school opening Oct- 1. Tom McKevitt, '32, is here as an instructor, al­though he expects to be shifted as soon as the present indoctrination class is finished. He had his family here for a while, but moved them back to Washington for better housing facilities. 

I took the time to run through the battalion directory of the present class, which is the last. 
incidentally, and I find the following Notre Dame 
men listed: 

Ens. Frank Albert, '40, Lt. (jg) Loais L. Cor­coran, ex. '33. Ens, Wayne A. Shriwise, '43, Ens. Robert M. Czezek. '38, Ens. Joseph L, McDonald. *39. Ens. James J. Nelson. '40. Ens. Joseph F. Cattie.

If I hapen to run into any of these fellows, I'll try and get some more news but we are kept so bus>' that we seldom get to know anyone outside of our own eection. 
The Staley document folIov*-s: "Better get out your class book of *33 to re­fresh your memory of the writer. This is my first communication to a class secretary sinca gradu­ation. But upon seeing my dear twin brother, Lt. (jg) Frederick S. Staley, mentioned in the June 1944 *Alumnus,' I just had to write to let the world know that as twins, we were still carrying on in identical fashion. 
"Seton beat me into the Navy by some 7 ^ months and the last word has him getting his ship commissioned at the Boston Navy yards and weighing anchor for his 'shake down.' He is CO of an LCI. 
"Like Seton, I have two children—a toy and a girl. The latter obliged me by being born on June 19 in order to come home from the maternity hospital (to be near her mother) on the 29th. So her d::d had all of a day with her ere he shipped off to Plattsburg. 
"Been working the last four years in Milwaukee to aid and abet the distribution of Proctor & Gamble's famous brands (plug). 
"Here in Plattsburg we are inspired to get up a local N.D. club but lack the time to organize it. Like all indoctrination schools, we are kept busy and being so long from the habit of study­ing, v.-e are somewhat slow at extracting the meat of an assignment. But among the faces to be seen here are: John Stackpoole, Joe Zwers, Albert Van HuffeJ, and John McGuire. Probably must T>e others as there are many Chicago boys here. 
"Must return to my duties as 'student quarter­master* of the day. 
"My regards via the 'Alumnus' to Major Ray Naber, '33. Tell him his neighbor Ed Steinboch is in our company." 
Mike Koken writes from Normandy where he went in with the second wave on D-day.

D. guard, on the boat coming over to England, and he says he's in training to outdo Scrapiron Yonns when he gets back. Also met Chack O'Reilly, '38, on the boat, and he told me later he ran into Lt. Fred Carideo, '36. the former N. D. fullbcck." 
Lt. Chuck Hafrcn, now on duty with the Navy in the Pacific theater, recently dropped in on Lt. Bob Cahill. '34. at Bob's southwest Pacific head­quarters. 2nd Lt. Tom Murray is serving in the office of the chief of transportation in the ETO.

onnaissance duty with Fatton's Third Army. 
On a recent trip to the South\yesf, I wrs un­

Another year has rolled around and another Army-Notre Dame game is upon us. I am looking forward to seeing many of you-
Take a few- minutes oflf and drop a line as to your whereabouts and those of our class whom you have seen recently.

From Hodi: We missed the mail several times, gang, because w*e were on the road when deadline came along. But w'e are back on the beam again and hope to remain there. We appreciate the editors keeping things moving for us, and the dope you send along to us and to them in the meantime. As we go over our material we are shocked to realize that one of our V-Mail letters will be the last we will hear from the writer. Ray Shea sent us a letter back in April that was delayed in transit. It arrived about the same time the "Alumnus" reported him killed in action. The following is the last report of Ray. one of the '35ers we all liked and respected. "England—April 2. 1944 "Dear Hoch: "I see where you are desperately in * need of news for the column. Perhaps I can help you out with a line or two. Have been here long enough now to have gotten used to the dampness, if that is at all possible. 
"Can't give you much news about our own gang for -I haven't seen but one of them since I have been in this man's amy . I ran into Bob Carter at Mass in Miami Beach some time ago. He was then and still is athletic officer at OCS. Did meet Harry Gafney on the street in Spring­field, Mass., about a year ago. He was trying to get into the service then. 
"On the base there are two other N.D. men— Capt. Tom Liston, class of '40. who is in my squadron, and a Lt. Raffolio from the class of 
•'2 with the service rronp. Now und then T have a chat with Col. Gabreski, ex. '42, who is one of the leading fliers in this theatre. 
"I know Lefty Dnnn is overseas now but just where I haven't been able to find out as yet. Now and then I hear from Ed O'Hara and Frank Max­weU, both of whom were in civvies but sweating out the draft board the last I knew. 

"I tried to get to the Notre Dama reunion in London a couple of months ago, but missed it by hours. Have had the chance to see a few of the historical spots in that city. Quite a thrill actually to' stand before some of the places you studied about a few years back. 
"My job keeps me right out straight most of 
the time, and I enjoy it immensely. Hope you 
can get some copy out of this." 
Ray Shea 
To Ray's family the Class of *35 extends its deepest sympathy. We too miss a worthy and fine man! 
A month earlier, March 22, 1944, Bob Maher sent along a V-Mail letter from the South Pacific. Bob's letter too was delayed along the way. Bob is now a captain in the Medical Corps. Says Bob: 
"Just a line to let you, and through your col­umn in the 'Alumnus* my buddies of *35, know that I'm right in the thick of things. Have been in active combat zone with the surgical end of this Field Hospital for three months. Spent a most delightful month visiting several of the large cities in Australia. For a few weeks things were plenty 'hot' in this area, but the action has cooled down to only night air raids by the Nip bombers. Have really had a swell time out of it all. Met an old pre-med buddy, Leo Hofschncider^ *36. who is a battalion surgeon in this area—his unit is [censored]." 
We certainly appreciated j'our note. Bob. anil hope that the long delay in getting this to press will not dampen your* enthusiasm to write us again. Ever run into Vince Gorman out that way ? Last we heard he was medical officer of an LST. 
Here comes a short word from Pat Qulicley, a lieutenant in the USNR. Pat wrote on June 28 as follows: 
"Some time ago in the West Indies I received a copy of the* N. D. Alumnus.' It was a trifle tardy in catching up with me; howei'er. it cer­tainly was a pleasure to read of old friends. 
"Best of luck to you on your new assignment in New Orleans—quite a place! Incidentally a 'tall one' at the St. Charles, now, would hit the spot. 
"Data on P.Q.—Enlisted in the Sea Bees in 1942—duty in Aleutian Islands. Commissioned in 1943—Armed Guard. This duty is really O.K.— see the world, etc. 
"Have met numerous N.D. men but none of the '35 class. The next time in New York will look up Tom Proctor for a hello." 
Thanks for the letter, Pat. Hops you can come ashore here in New Orleans soon. 

On July 24 Vic Kurzweff found a moment to pen off a few lines. Way out in the New Hebrides. Vic writes: 
"I recently received a clipping from the 'Alum­nus' in which you mentioned that you tried to contact me in Plaquemine, and am indeed sorry that I wasn't there to greet you. 
"Camille [Gravel] was a little off on the info he gave you about me. Instead of being a lieuten­ant in the army in New* York City, I am a lieu­tenant, USNR, in the South Pacific. At present I am in the New Hebrides Islands, but am boarding a plane in the morning for the north (but still below the equator). 
"Unfortunately I haven*t run info many of the *35ers since I've been in the Na\-y. Phil Jacobs, his wife and my wife, and I had a couple of visits together in San Francisco a couple of months before I came out- Phil was back in San Francisco to pick up a new ship, and I was sta­tioned there at the time. 
"Here is hoping this is over in time for our ten-year reunion. My regards to your wife." 
It was good hearing from you. Vic. Glad that you have your eye on that ten-year reunion. Now that it has been made a matter of record—how about it, gang? Got any ideas? Less than a year to the date—do we or don't we reunion? 

Two more letters came through via the Alum­ni Office and our gracious editors handled the news for us direct and then sent along the let­ters to your scribe. They were from JI H Qaina. a lieutenant (jg) USNR. who is a supply and dis­bursing officer in the Naval Air service way down under; and from Sir Sloszka, who continues teaching in a senior high school on Long Island and in his "spare time" builds the personnel that builds the Navy Hellcat fighter planes. Thanks for the letters, fellas, and congratulations on the ad­dition to the family, Sig. 
Now then to miscellaneous accounts— 
One night several months ago we received a 

pleasant surprise when Tom Graves called us on 
the phone. Tom, then stationed at the Mobile Air 
Service Command as public relations officer, and 
a first lieutenant, was in over the week-end. He 
said he had been in Mobile since January. *43. 
Not having heard further from him. he may now 
be moved. Tom said he had word that Bob SiaK 
mons was a corporal in the army and had recent­
ly maneuvered in the south somewhere. 
The other day as we were getting off the ele­vator at the Eighth Naval District we walked smack into John Hoban. John was in to get an­other ship. In the Navy as an officer, Johnnie said he had seen several years service and was on the stage for the invasion of Europa. He ex­pects now to move out to the Pacific-
About two months ago the "little woman" re­ceived a call from Jack Kanz. He was down here to take on ship and crew-. An ensign. Jake seemed to be "chief and bottle-washer" on Iioard the LST—in other words he handled personnel and supplies. ^Vben your scribe returned to town we had dinner out to the house and an interesting evening together. 
Three weeks ago an airmail special delivery letter brought the surprising news that Art Con­rad WES coming to New Orleans. Art, a lieuten­ant (jg) in Naval Aviation—administration— is now a member of one of several committees tour­ing the various naval districts striving to stand­ardize naval terminology. Two weeks ego the Polish ambassador of goodwill set foot in the Creole City with colleagues and superior officer. It was good to see Art—he who never changes with the years—and to take away a bit of his spare change in a friendly poker game at the house one evening. The Army. Navy and Coast Guard were included among the players, and the Army won—but definitely. 
Art said he tried to see Tom Proctor in New York some time back but found the FVexie out of town every time he called. But then Mrs. P. was a good substitute. 
This is it, gang! Keep the dope rolling in and we will send it out over the wires! 
CpL John Smyth, Chicago, now stationed at Camp Van Dorn. Miss., visited the campus in early August, It's now Capt. Dick ScliBKer, ac­cording to an announcement made by headquar­ters. Fourth Air Force, San Francisco, where Dick is on duty as a radio and radar officer. 
From Sig Slaszka. Floral Park, N. Y.: "I still teach in a senior high school. And. still work in Grumman Aircraft—'Hellcat* wings production —as personnel man. I've been here for almost three years on the night shift. 
"Ed Walsh, '29. was doing inspection on the final rssembly of the 'Avenger' wings for quite some time. He joined up. Capt. Jim MacDevitt, '35, is (was) in Rome for some time. He htd an audience with Pope Pius XII. A ledger of N. D. men v.*ere chronicled in his recent letter whose names and exploits my memory does not recall at the moment. It's Lt. (w> Jordan Haqrrerct '35. He was stationed as an instructor at Norfolk. A daughter has made her appearance earlier in the year." 
Sig also sent in the slad news that a child. Barbara Louise, was bom to them in January. 
Umn O'Shea, Cairo, 111., writes that he met Lt. <•«) PUl DanMdy, '33. who returned to his home during a 10.day leave of absence from his duties with the USN in Washington, D. C. He goes on to say. "A little more than two months ago it was my pleasure and privilege to have Rev. KayaMBd Clancy, CS.C.. '29, as my guest here in Cairo, while en rmite between assign­ments. It was rather a shock to me to have a letter from Mrs. W. S- Ford of El Paso, Tex., advising me of the death on June 13 of her son. Rer. Wilfiam Fvrd, aS.C, '33. Father Foz^ as you know, was a very close friend during our days together on the N. D. campus." 
Russ also mentions that while handling some business matters, he found himself dealing with Jeny AnuM, *24, cashier of the Lincoln National Life Insurance Co.'s St. I^uis office- Russ found out through Jerry, that two old friends and classmates, Raland Dames, '33, and Lows Fddiff, '37. were president and secretary, respectively, of the St Louis N. D. club.

From Joe lUiuIdd: 
Hie mail has been on the light side these past 
few months with only a few letters from the 
class. John Haran beat the deadline by inches 
with a note from "somewhere in Italy." I'll pass 
it along to you in toto: Somewhere In Italy 
21 Aogust 1944 

"I got the Jane issue of the 'Alumnus' a short time ago and certainly enjoyed reading your col­umn. I also noted that I was due to drop you a line, so here it is coming to you from a little Italian port which the Allies captured recently. This place was the scene of some heavy action and the place wns really blasted. It's a depressing sight to walk through the town and see the com­plete dsstruction. Many of the natives era still living in the hills where they went when our boml:ers came over and started plastering the local iron works. Those who have returned are living in bombed out houses with walls blown in. shell holes through the sides, etc. They are pov­erty stricken beyond the comprehension of the average American who takes luxuries like drink­ing water, brcsd, meat and clothes for granted. 
"There is much disease ashore so that we must take our own food and water with us when we go travelling. There are no regular means of transportation at all and the roads are not good. We get around easily by hitch-hiking on the thousands of Anny trucks, jeeps, etc. It's not difficult to hitch-hike by plane and I rode in from Rome the other day on a C-4T. 
"I transferred from that tanker 1 was on to my present ship in June. While in N. Y. waiting orders I called you twice but you were on vaca­tion. Sorry we couldn't have gotten together for a few beers and a steak at your hangout in Radio City. I could sure go for a few cold steins of beer at the moment. 
"Here's some news for the 'Alumnus.' While in Liverpool last May I met three N.D. men in the space of an hour: Lt. Joe Pctritz. 1TSNR, who used to do such a swell job handling N.D. sports p-i'-reiy. Lt. 'JT) Jim D-t on. USCGE. ard Lt. <jc) VecmB Tetnwit USNR. Joe b an Armed Guard commander like myself and we came back in the same convoy to the States. Dutton and 
The Notre Dame Alumnus 
Tetratilt have an office to themselves and are at­tached to the USN port office in Liverpool. Unfor­tunately, we didn't have much time to 'shoot the breeze' but it was certainly s\vell to see them. Met Lt. (jr) Sam Beed in Norfolk last July. Sam is doing engineering work for the Navy. 
"I haven't been fortunate enough to hump in­to any other ND men except Jerry Gillespie, '37, who is a lieutenant (jg) and is also in the Armed Guanl. Jerry was married in N. Y. on June 10 to Miss Sheila Gore. I've heard recently from SfSet. Bad Goldman -whose address is Vaughn General Hospital, Hines, III. Bud and Mrs. G. are hoping to get down to N.D. one of these week-ends for a football game. Had a V-Mail last April from Capt. Jim MacDevitt, 'o5, who was then in Italy. Also a very novel announce­ment from Jim Kirby (FBI—Detroit) of the birth of Mary Colleen Krby on March 5. I was pro­moted to full lieutenant last March 1 but since I was at sea the extra half-stripe didn't get put on till June." 
Thanks for the newsy letter, John—and Con­grats on that new half-stripe. 
From Joe BlacDonald comes a letter which tells us that he and Mrs. Mac are rearing quite a family, two boys—Joe. Jr., age four; George William, age two plus; and a charming daugh­ter. Rosemary Elizabeth, age five and a half months. Joe is in my class now with those three youngsters. Joe's, current address—11 Grove St.. Englewood, N. J. 
We had a letter from Andy McMahon a short time back and also one from Lt. John Desmond. Both are in England—at least they were when they •wrote to me. 
lisny Palkovic, a faithful contributor to the column, is at Camp Thomas. Newport. R. I. I understand Larry is doing a great job down there. 
Drop me a card and I'll pass the news along to the class.

From John Hariey, 46 Delancey Dr., Geneva, 
N. Y.: "For the past year and a half I have been working for Civil Service at the naval training csenter here. Though the station is the second 
largest in the country, I have met few Notre Dame men who have heen stationed here. 
"The most important news from my vie^vpoint is my marriage on July 29 to Miss Ann McCar­thy of Elmira. One of the ushers at the wedding was Bamon Belmont, '36, of Geneva. We are li\'ing in Geneva, and if there are any Notre Dame men stationed at Sampson who would like to try a home cooked meal we would welcome them. 
"As you probably knoH-. L t Cmdr. Jimmy Crowley is the athletic officer here and at the mo­ment is moulding together a team which will give an account of itself against such opposition as the Green Bay Packers and New York Giants. Only other Notre Dame man I have seen on the sta­tion Is Jim FenncH, '42. who received his 'boot' training here and is now waiting for an opening in midshipman's school for which he has been accepted. 
"I had a recent letter from A] Bride, '37, who is a warrant officer with the SSth Airborne Infan­try at Camp Hackall. N. C. A!, who has been shifted from one section- of the country to another Thomas J. Radigan, '38, Gary, Ind-t 
was graduated from recruit training as 
honor man of his company at tfae U. S. 
Naval Training Center, Great Lakes* III. 
Tom was elected candidate by his 
fellow bluejackets and selected honor 
man by his company commander on the 
basis of military aptitude and progress. 
Prior to joining tfae Navy he was of­
fice manager for Radigan Brothers, 
Gary. He had been graduated from the 
University of Indiana with the degree of 
bachelor of laws. His wife and two sons 
are in Gary, 
for the last three years, is anxious to get into action as the quickest method of geting this war over and going home. 
"To contradict an earlier statement, I must men­tion that Chief Specialist Phil Dahar, '39, was on the station for a long time in the recruit train­ing section. 
"In my own family, my brother Jim, *41, is serving ^rith the quartermaster corps in the South Pacific and as I write is stationed on Guad­alcanal. Cousins, Hnghie Smith, '39. and Geny Smith, '42, are respectively staff sergeant with the troop carrier command at the Indianapolis Air Base and naval lieutenant Us) stationed in Hawaii. 
"I would like to add just a word in praise of Lt. Frank Hnisking, whose death was noted in a recent 'Alumnus.' For most of the time during four years Frank sat next to me in class in the alphabetical 'Huisking. Hurley' line-up. During those four years I never heard Frank say an un­kind or uncharitable word. I can remember Frank at morning Mass and evening prayer when some of us might be taking a walk. He was a Christian gentleman, one of Notre Dame's and the class of *37's finer boasts." 
Tom Doyle, Chicago, has been promoted to tech­nical sergeant in England as announced from headquarters of his I<nnth Air Force service com­mand station. Tom entered the service in Janu­ary, 1942, and left the States in October. Since 
that time, he has vi^ted several foreign coutries, including India, Iran, Arabia, Egypt, liibya, Tunisia, Algiers and Sicily. 
Capt. Al Snisdovaki is (was) stationed at Camp lavingston. La. Another captain, Tom Cassidy, wrote from France after D^Jay, "Our channel crossing was not eventful—^no enemy planes, subs or ships. The landing was perfect. I came in on an LST and we beached in good shape. On an­other LST that ^vas beside us in the harbor I met a classmate of mine from N. D.—Ed CaldweU, '35. Good suprise." Itt Lt* Bill Gomber. who has been in the army since February, 1942, was at Cbmp Shelby, Miss., in July, according to a fine letter from his father of "The Wall Street Jour­nal." Bill is with the anti-aircraft branch of the automatic weapons division. 
Phil Bondi wrote from Rockford: *'Elmer Zcn­ner is an ensign and I believe in amphibious forces. Last I heard he was in New York. Jerry CUesrs writes he is at Klamath Falls. Ore., at a naval air station, is a lieutenant (ig). He also notes Larry Danbom is teaching at naval pre­flight school in Athens. Ga. Gordon Murphy is a captain and has been in Italy for some time. Joe Qunn has been in Atlantic convoy service for two years." 
Capt. Bill FaUon, AAF, visited friends in South Bend in September. 
Lt. (ir) Joe Druecker, c/o FPO, New York, is commanding officer of an LCI. 
Rev. Frank Sampson is a chaplain of a para­troop group which jumped into Normandy on D-day. A clipping from the "Portland (Ore.) Ore­gonian" tells vividly of experiences on that day: 
"Father Sampson, who attended Franklin high school and Notre Dame University, said all the men attended religious services the night before they were to drop on Euroi>e. A prayer service was held in the huge plane on the way to France. 
"When he jumped," the chaplain said, "he came down in the deep part of a swamp and only by shedding his heavy equipment was he able to get to safety. 
"Included in the dumped equipment was his mess kit. When he had reached shore he stripped and flived for the all-important kit- After five or six dives he retrieved it. 
"During his adventures before returning to England. Father Sampson was in a small fVench house surrounded by German troops. One of the American wounded died in the chaplain's arms, clutching a crucifix taken from the wall of the 
home."

From Hal Willsanu: We have a number of swell letters for this issue, but we'll give the lead to JtAnny O'Con­nor, our senior class president. John, who is now an ensign in the Navy, writes. "Tonight I bor­rowed the 'Alumnus' from Car] Hciser, '42. and read it from cover to cover. It makes the third 'Alumnus* I've seen since January. '42. . . . Since I saw you in November, 1941, in Washington, I have taken the 'long step*—with a red-headed Brownsville, Texas, girl, the daughter of A. A. Browne, a N.D. grad of around 1890. We are ex­pecting a prospective N.D. or St. Mary's 1964 freshman in several months. In K ^ West last week I ran into Pat Carey and SEW Tom Fitz­gerald and his wife in Miami. Both boys are in the Navy, Have heard from Jack Anton and Scot­ty Keardon several times; both are still in Chi­cago. 
"I got a big bang out of reading about Bill Mirfcring and Pf c Charlie CalUkaiu You'U never get me to believe that the Army gets Callahan up at 0600—^he has figured out an angle by this time. 

. . . Have heard nothing from Jack O'Lcaty or Johnny Wilson, although I have written several times. Jack, of cotirse, is busy these nights with his two children. I was at Fort Schuyler in New-York with Babe Kelly and Hoose Williams last spring. I believe both are now in Norfolk. . . . All of US were sad to hear that Leo WelA has been reported missing in the Pacific in June." John gives two addresses and asks that mail be sent to the latter: 824 Alton Road Na 20, Miami Beach, Fla., and 437 E. 44th St., Indianepolis. 
Now a V-mail letter from Lt- John P. Fox, Jr., 

' F.P.O., San Francisco. He writes, "Just recently received the June 'Alumnus/ and it certainly was a lot of pleasure to read about the school and particularly about the old classmates. . . . While I haven't seen any fellows from our class I have run into quite a few N.D. men. Gordon Love, '40, was lost at Saipan. He was the first pilot to land on the captured strip when he had a little diffi­culty with his plane and couldn't land aboard ship. A couple of days later his number was up. Around the first of the year I saw Dan Gibbs who was flying in the same squadron. Both were flying torpedo planes. . -. I am on my second year in a carrier squadron flying fighters and enjoying every minute. It sure has its advantages over instructing, which I did for 18 months. . . . Pm still single. . . . Give my regards to all the boys. ..." 
And speaking of Gibbs: I was in Chicago re­cently and my aunt told me that on Aug. 26 she attended the wedding of Lt. (jg) Dan Gibbs and Miss Rita Marie Dunigan in St. Edmund's Church, Oak Park, III. (Chica^ suburb). Rita*s brother, Edward Donigan, graduated from Notre Dame in 
•43. And while I vras in Oak Park I met the mother of Jack McAoliffe. His mother, who is an old friend of my parents, told me that Jack has signed up with the regular Navy, is a full lieu­tenant, and is serving in Rhode Island after being stationed in Minnesota. Fred Sisk and Charlie Bennett, both '39ers, were in Chicago at­tending an army school. Fred is stationed in Detroit, and Charlie. I believe, is stationed in Texas. 
Lt. Thomas J. Elder. APO 565, San Francisco, writes, "You know sometimes I have a guilty feeling when I pick up the 'Alumnus' and think that in all the time that we have been out of school I haven't written but two or three letters to any of the classmates. I don't have any hot news now, only I think that this might ease my conscience. . . . I've been in the SWPA now for the past six months and have run into only one fellow from our class—^BiU Condon, who is now a captain in the quartermaster corps. .. . I had a letter from Larry Dillon, who has been trying desperately to get in some branch of the serv­ice, but is always turned down because of his eyes and feet He told me that Tim Crnice was a captain and was battling his way up through It­aly. Foley and Caranaogh are still in Detroit. Bob Weaver is now with the Department of Justice, stationed in the Carolinas. Tom Judge. '40, is in 
the Navy. 
"Mother wrote me that Tommy Wnkovits was working for Ilrestone in their Coshocton (Ohio) plant. Saw a fellow from Indianapolis and he told me that he had seen Dave Connor in the Fiji Is­lands, but thought that he had moved on as that was some time ago. Before leaving the States I ^as visiting a bar in Frisco and some civilian was bnmping my arm. I was just getting ready to tell him oft when he turned—it was Frank Bright, who is working for the Government. . . ' We are on an island that was Jap territory only 
a. short time aga . . ." 
Writes Swede Baner: "I'm still, by the grace of God and the local draft board, cost accountant for the La Porte (Ind.) Corporation which makes parts for bombers. On May 25 Burnett Patridc arrived to keep his sister Betty Ann compaziy. The Patrick is the result of his mother's total Irish ancestry, and N.D.'s influence on his father. . . . ITie 'Victorian* magazine carried an article of mine in its July issue against compulsory mil­itary training for all boys in peacetime. . . . Jae Wehrle, my Badin Hall roommate, ia still here managing his father's plant. Joe is married and has a Joe. Jr, Lt. Tom Bohen sent a card that he now has a daughter, Patricia, bom at Tt Benning, Ga.. in April. They have a son. Mike, alsa" And that's from the Good Thunder Sage. 
And now a lovely letter^in fact, one of the nicest letters ever received by this secretary: "I see that you like to have news of the boys, so here is an item about Lt. George R. SaOiran, of Monticello. Ind. We always called him Bob at home, but when he entered Notre Dame there were so many SulHvans that he had to drag out the George in his name. He is with the Navy Air Force somewhere in the Pacific, having gone out about May 1. He is a fighter sqxiadran leader on a carrier. On April 10, 1943. he was married to Kathleen Sullivan (yes. her name is Sullivan too), of Merrill; Wis. On July 14, 1944, a son, Michael, was born, and you can bet George is anxious to get this war over to come home to see his wife and son. Also I know he will visit Notre Dame the first opportunity he has and seek our old acquaintances. I remain yours truly, his mother. Mrs. C. A. Sullivan." 
And now another fine note: "My son, WiOiaM 
V. Clitford, is a captain in a mechanized cavalry reconnaissance squadron and has been in England for the past two years. He was injured in fiance on July 26 when hit by a shell fragment which fractured his left leg, and caused flesh wounds on his right le^. A recent letter from him states he is getting along fine, and exx)ects to be sent back to a convalescent ho^ital in the U.S-A. sometime soon. Yours truly, T. H. Clifford, 715 Harrison St, Gary, Ind." Thanks, Mr. Clifford, for your thoughtfulness in writing. And the best of luck to Bill, a mighty swell guy. 
And now two letters from our prolific combat correspondent. Major Joe CaUahan, AFt) 758, Neu- York. In August Joe wrote that he bad vis­ited Rome. He says, "I thank God that I was able to make it We managed to go all through St Peter's, and finished up by having an audience with the Holy Father. It's something that I will never forget. . . . While on board a Navy ship some time back I ran into two ship's officers who were at N.D. with us—Lt (jg) John Femedinc. '40, and Lt. H. G. BfcCarty. of our class, Ihey were the first N.D. boys I have seen in a long time and we had some mighty pleasant conversa­tions about the old days." 
On Aug. 30 Joe writes from Southern France, "Since our arrival here on Aug. 15 things have been going very well indeed. . . . The initial landings were carried out with very light casual­ties, and we've worked inland so fast that the Germans have had no time to get set I think the whole business could rightly be called a 'rapidly deteriorating situation.' At the present writing I'm rounding out two years overseas—still hope to see home by. Christmas this time. And tell the boys to have one for me at the Penn Bar the night of the Army game." 
And this card from Father Tony GOHCS, 344 St. New Bedford. Mass. "I see in the 'Alumnus* that Tom Healy wanted my address. I have just written to him. I intend to go to the Army game this fall. Was talking to Father Dan Gleasm, former N.Y. city traffic policeman and now a 
C.S.C. He was in my liatin class at N-D, Give my regards to' all the boys. Tell them I say a Mass once a month for the intentions of all my 
N.D. classmates who are in the service."

Three pcunts before I close: First, tiie letters have been coming in fine; keep them* up.

A letter from Lt. <iK) Den Hickey, serving aboard an LST in the Normandy inva^on, de­scribes the battling in his sector of the French front: "They have thdr fifth team in there now; we have sent the first four to the showers. The coadi has used up all his plays, and his aerial at­tack has been completely smothered. It doesn't look as thou^ he can punt out either—his kxekers are crippled and. besides, his players are pretty badly demoralized. The scoreboard shows a lop­sided score and the hand on the time dock is on its last turn." Don's brothers. Lt. <JK) Jeny and Ena, Jfllm, are both serving in the Pacific

From Vine* De Conrsey: 
Just in case some of the boys have written in to you during the past few months wondering why their news has not appeared in print, I here­by authorize you to inform them that their class secretary has been very negligent about his du­ties. But also add that he has now reformed, turned over a new Jeaf, made a new st::rt, and what have you, and with right hand placed on his 1-A card swears that now and from hence­forth, each month shall see his wife slaving away over a hot typewTJter gretting the news to the "Alumnus." 
Reviewing all the unreported correspondence, we find Larry Sutton writing from Waycross Army Air Field, Waycross. Ga-, from whence he has probably departed by this time- Chuck Rasor 
•was sighted in Memphis with the ATC boys; he's a navigator on a B-24 and has been around. Capt-Bfartin HcGinnis (with whom we never made contact in his stay at Fort Riley as a cavalrj­man) was in Arizona taking his advanced train­ing in twin engined planes. Jim Graham was teaching AT16*s at Miami. Okla. (But more re­cently he has been flying for Mid-Continent Air­lines out of Kansas City). 
Nice long letter from Al Klefer out in New Guinea. Just what a graduate in pharmscy is do­ing w-ay out there he didn't say, but he did wish he xvasn't- Wanted to know v.-here Ed Simonich. Bob Ortale. Joe McDonald, and Art Verhoestra wera (and so would we). 
Wedding announcement from prime correspon­dent Dino Fabioni, who is to be married soon to Victoria Gasior in Lockport, N. Y. Then a letter from said Dino, practicing law in Lockpcrt, and expressing shock at the news in last month's "Alumnus" on our losses in that month. 
A note that it is Lt. Joseph M. Dunn, Naval Air Base, Sha«-ne2. Okla. And if Joe ever gets out of the oil wells, he's welcome in K*insas City. 
The other day a nice letter from Fred Sisk, whom vre last saw in Chicago oyer a year ago. 
. Hal Williams^ *38. sec, was in Chicago and about as enthusiastic as ever about things. How he mana^s to be in the Army and keep up his col­umn is a mystery he ought to teach me. Charlie Bennett, the golfer from St. Augustine, was also in Chicago—but stationed out in Texas. 
Welcome news from and about Dick O^Melia (beg pardon. Major R. J. O'Melia, USMCR). Dick left the U.S. in February and is squadron com­mander of a dive bomber outfit somewhere in the South Pacific- Back in the states, Kevin Michael O'Melia is waiting to see his daddy for the first time.

[Dave was at N.D. for a day in September on his way to his new spot in the JJOS Angeles area. Was looking swell and an­ticipating a stay in the U.S. His chief mean was that he had to leave Boston just before the Dart­mouth game—Eds.] Saw Joe McDcrmatt and Charlie McCarthy, '40, out in the South Pacific Phil Lncter (of '42) had a rugged time in the Solomons area, but finally got away. (A letter from my brother. Bill, who was Phil's roommate at N-D.. says that Fhil is a jg. now in Michigan somewhere going to school—^Bill is with the Air Force in England.) Pete Shcdian was around on an LST. Bumped into Charlie Carroll and Clutrlie Metzger in Frisco. Jthn Qninn is at radar school in MIT and Joe Rizzi is doing coast inspection work out of Boston. Al SdimiU is now on the Atlantic on a destroj-er. Ed O'DonneD Is in Bridgeport doing Navy inspecting- Lake Mcddn­cfis is around Waterbury, Conn. And that's that.

From 2nd Lt. Ed O'Meara: "After a year in Greenland and several other months in Alabama and Kentucky. I wound up at Miami Beach and the AAF's OCS last Febru­ary, completed the course and was commissioned in May, and then went to Air Intelligence school at Orlando, Fla. I was then assigned to the Sec­ond Air Force, and a couple of weeks ago arrived here at Mountain Home AAB, far out on the mountain-surrounded flatlands of southwestern Idaho, doing intelligence work and training of combat crews. 
"I ran into several N.D. men in my recent ramblings. The first, Leo Bush, was at Miami Beach when I was there, and disappeared into thin air after graduation. About a *34 man, I think. In my group at Orlando in intelligence school were Joseph A. Tracy, '42, who went from there to Drew Fie!d, Tampa, and Dick Whalen,. '41 or so, whose new address, I believe, is Hq AAF. AC/AS Intelligence, Technical Air Intelli­gence Division, Washington 25, D. C.—which is about as high a headquarters as you can go and still be in the AAF. 
"At Miami or there::bout most of the time I was around was Lt. (jg) Pete Sandrodc* '39 (he's the fellow who is carrying on and trying to in­ternationalize the "Hi'yah" he learned from Father Farley yeprs ago), who was bearing up well under the weight of the entire U. S. Navy last time I saw him. Ffete's current addresses are 1415 Patton Ave,, or N.O.B., Terminal Island, San Pedro. Calif., with the initials H.E.C.D. com­ing in for something somewhere in the Terminal address. 
*Tm engaged to Miss Frances Mae Sullivan of Portland. Ore. If you can ima^ne a much better name for a N.P. man to tangle up with, you've got me beaten. 
"Oh. yes—any mv old Howcrd Street roommate, Ed Sandstrom, M.A. '39, is still beating new pathways over in the England'France area, but may be in Germany by the time you get this. He was one of the supply bosses for the Ninth Troop Transport command, and at last rumor, he had been promoted to. nnajor. About six months after every promotion. Sandstrom finally gets around to admitting it." 
From Art Bladdalena came a long overdue letter to Bob Sanford: 
"Hope this note will make up for three years* negligence. Since leaving N- D; back in January. 

1941. life has keen full of laughs. Pat O'Neill and I finished up midshipman school at the academy in Annapolis in May, 1941, Pat getting his com­mission as a *snip3* and I took the deck. I was very fortunate in being assigned to a new repair ship, the Vulcan, and after shakedown in the West Indies, headed for the north Atlantic Spent six months there, mostly in Iceland. Saw Ed Bad-door while there; he was flying one of our PBYs. 
"Recalled in December, 1941, u-ent to west coast for armed guard and enjoyed a couple of good sunshiny months in California Then back to the east coast. Russia, South America. Africa and the West Indies. All of this traveling took about a year—sprinkled here and there with subs and jerry bombers. During all this time never ran into any of the old gang, prob::bly because we were moving too fast. 
"Then in April. 1943, down to the mecca for all navy officers. Miami's sub-chaser school. Harr>* Bcisvert, the *40, president. v.-as there, just back from a tour of duty in South American waters.

Riy is the proud dad of a one-year-old son. His brother. Dr. Boy Pinelli, '40, was interning at St. Lcke's Hospital, San FVancisco, and was booked for the Navy in October. 
Lt. Bab Sweeney. South Bend, was home on leave after completing 35 missions as a Liberator pilot over occupied Earop3. Bob had been awarded the Air Medal with oak leaf clusters. Another South Bend boy, home for a brief spell from bis navy duties in the Atlantic, was Lt. Walt Fecaa. 
Lt. Cfaucnce Mjmm was one of the many N.D. men who participated in the invasion. Jerry Hiduy» South Bend, has been promoted to liea­tenant (jg) in the South Pacific, where he is serving with the seabces. 
Elmer Kamm reported that his brothers. CpL Will, '40, and Sgt. Gerry, '43, both have APOs out of New York City. Lt.

Jack, before join­ing the Navy in March, 1942, was head coach at Rockhurst College, Kansas City. Warren Deahl, who Is stationed at Camp Blanding, Fla., visited the University recently on his leave. 
Jack Patterson, who landed in France on I>­Day, wrote a fascinating letter to his folks on July 20. Here's a quote: 
"When the 3,000 planes raided the Jerries pre­vious to the present business at hand, I was just a mile away. The ground shook and grumbled until some people got sick in the stomach. How those Germans who sur\'ive £uch a pounding can look forward to the next dose and still go on, I don't know. Some of the prisoners taken just afterwards were like idiots. Their eyes were glassy, they babbled and mumbled; they didn't fight at all. 
"When you see the terrible power of the Allies, no question remains as to the futility in the Ger­man fight- The French can see the hand^vriting plainly now. They are amazed at the unending line of vehicles of every imaginable size and type which roll over the roads" 
From Art Hornby, Capt, A.C. to Lt. John Pat­terson: "Guess I owe the class of *41 an apology for I haven't sent in 'any news since I was a cadet—back in August, 1941. Lots of things have happened since then, including two tours of duty overseas—in Africa, India and China. 
"I've been back in 'God's Country' for a few months now but while 'over there' I ran into Ray Sadlier, '40, a Red Cross worker in India. Saw a lot of Lt, Tom Tmeman in Africa for we were based at the same field. And also in Africa, Pat Gogeins, '30, was attached to my squadron as a Boeing representative- Guess he was a jinx be­cause the only time he rode with me we had to come in on three en^nes. I no sooner hit Mac-Dill Field in Florida than I ran into Lt. Barney Ferry, and Capt. Nick Rinaldi. both stationed there. 
"After a short leave I was sent out here to Kansas and am now first pilot on a B-29. Lt. Bob Schlaycr and Lt. Bob Stack are both navigators in the same group with me. Just goes to show you that Notre Dame men are in there pitching all over the world. Sure would like to hear from Capt. Bill Spalding, Bob Iliff. Dnfiy and Romeo and Wilson Crandell." 
Lt. Matt Byrnes, naval aviator of Hamilton, OnL,, received the third air medal for meritori­ous achievement while participating in an attack on Japanese bases at Truk Atoll, Moen Island.

1942 CpL 
Pleasant St., Portagre. Wis. 
From Scoop Scanlon: 
Thanks to the continued cooperation of a lot of fellows, and their relatives back home, the class 
1st Lt. John A. Stack, '41, of Matti-tuck, L.I., co-pilot of an Eighth Air Force B-17 Flying Fortress, it here seen receiving the Distinguished Flying Cross for "extraordinary achievement*' while participating in heavy bombing attacks over Europe. The presentation is being made by Colonel Edgar M. Wittan, of Portage, Pa., combat wing com­mander. 
of '42 has another opportunity to read about those of our era. 
Several newcomers will be noticed this month. But on with the comment: 
Jim Rice, aviation cadet at Roswell, N. Mex.. got himself engaged on Sept. 3 to Miss Ruth Marie Jankowski of La Crosse, Wis. rnie bride-to-be is a teacher in the school where Jim coached before he donned the khaki. Miss Jankowski is a graduate of St- Teresa College, Winona, Minn. 
I had a pleasant surprise on Sept. 21 when Lt. Frank FIj-nn, the sociology professor, called from Great Lakes Naval Training Center while there on special duty. He had been stationed in Vir­ginia and reported that his family is living in La Crosse. Wis., for the duration. 
Late in August. I attended the coaching school at the University of Wisconsin which had plenty of the Notre Dame atmosphere. Harry Stabldrdier was sparkplug of the affair while Lr. Comdr. Jack Meagher, coach of Iowa Seahawks, was main speaker. Comdr. Meagher joshed as he re­called Ed McKeever, current head N.D. mentor. "I talked so much about Notre Dame when I had McKeever at St. Edward's University that he up and left me. Later he came back as a rival at Te-xas Tech." 
Bill Sticklen, former N.D. freshman cage ace. is currently tearing up the gridirons around Camp Ellis. III. 
Let's look into the mail bag: Lt. (jg) Bob Borke airmailed on Sept. 5: "fl­nally bumped into some N.D. boys. .. . I have been here and there and had little success in lo­cating any of my old friends but finally at an advance PT base I found Bemie Crimraiiu* Paul Lillis, Jchn Robinson and Pat Lambert. John is with the PBYs, and Pat is on a sea-going tug. We have been together for a week or so. "Larry Kelly was out here, but I missed htm as he shoved off for home about two weeks ago. I am a gunnery officer on an underwater def^ise ship. Ray Roy, one of my N.D. roommates, is on a tin-can out here and ready to go home. I got married as soon as I finished midshipman school and my home address is now; 111 Seventh St., Garden City, N. Y." 
From aboard ship in the Southwest Pacific, Lt Carty takes over: 
"I have had several weeks of ocean-crossing daring which I've mused on my two years in the stateside army, and the prominent part N.D. peo­ple have played in them, and have decided you might be interested. 
"There were several other N.D. men, '42 ver­sion, sweating out Army Air Forces OCS at Mi­ami Beach ,with me this spring, among them: Donald F. Connors, Jim Ferris^ Bob Courtney, Bob Strode. My old roommate in Dillon and Sorin. Ted MacDonald, was at the sub-chaser school in Miami and we had several good re­unions. Ted is now a lieutenant (iff) somewhere in the Atlantic. 
"I was assigned to Chanute Field, 111., after graduation and saw a good deal of Chicago. Had a nice visit with Jim McNnlty'a parents one Sun­day and learned that Jim is commanding a land­ing craft down here in the Southwest Pacific 
"Was ordered out to the West Coast in May for overseas processing in the Army Airways com­munications system, of which I am now a mem­ber. The hostess on my United Airliner was a very pretty Irish lass from Chicago, who turned out to be Mary Duggan, Chicago Teachers Col­lege, '43, who was Bill Piatt's Senior Ball date. 
*^Lt. Jim O'Donohoe and I had several fine week-ends together in San Francisco. Jim is now the assistant exchange oflScer at Fort McDowell, on Angel Island, in San Francisco Bay. We met Lt. <jc) Bill Bergan and his handsome bride-of­a-month, at Old St. Mary's church one Sunday. I had hoped to see Lt. (jg) Frank O'Dowd, but his submarine left shortly before I arrived. I did see his fiancee. Ensign Peggy Dempsey, however. She's at Western Frontier Headquarters in San Francisco and looks just as beautiful in Na\'y blue as she did in an evening gown at the Senior Ball. 
"Received a letter from Chuck Kearney several weeks ago. He's on a LST in the Mediterranean, is thinking of applying for submarine duty if his wife (the former Dor Curtis of Rockford. 111.) doesn't disapprove too strong. Chuck reports that Bob Hatton was on landing craft during the Big Show in Normandy. I'm looking forward to meeting more of the boys down here; will watch the 'Alumnus' for addresses. 
"Incidentally, Jack Malone's . . . doing his bit with Owens-Corning Glass. Toledo. While in San Francisco one week-end I went down to Treasure Island and saw Ens. Charley Kane, the Cleveland Heights flash, who had just brought his crash boat from. . . . He was tanned and rugged. . . . Ned Weinfartner, he mentioned, was on small craft, somewhere in the Mediterranean." 
From the "Radio Post," weekly of the Tniax Field, Madison, Wis., comes the report that SjStt, Bill Regan was named sergeant major of the physical training department. Regan's new title brings under him the delegated control of most functions of the department. 
Another new contributor takes a bow, the "Red Knight," Sgt. Joe M^erthney, writing from Ton­opah, Nev.: "I have had my trips around the country on the Army and, believe me, I am so dam tired of traveling I don't ever want to look at a train again until it is Tacoma-bound (one­way). I was in cadet pilot training, but soon took the fall and was eliminated in primary. 
"ITien after going to Denver for a few months, I hit Laredo, Texas, for gunnery school. When I finished, I was kept as an instructor. While there I met a few N.D. men. including Haarice Kelly and Stads Lonigan. Also had Mike Hampbreyn of Los Angeles as a student. . . . 

"I remained instructing at Laredo from Novem­ber until April. Then I went to Fort Myers, Fla., to Buckingham Field, and attended Central in­structors school for aerial gunnery-. . • From there I received a 17-day delay en route, plus seven days travel time. At the time all I knew was my next station was going to be in Tonopah. Now that I am here I can see why they were so generous. This is undoubtedly the world's worst hole in the United States. 
*'Tlie town is an old mining ghost town. The reason they picked a place like this is so they could practice bombing and shooting without any danger of hurting any civilians. Believe me, they would have a tough time iinding any civilians to bomb. The town itself has about 1,500 population. As for housing conditions, there just isn't any. The shacks they have used to be what the old miners would live in. Now they are so bad that only second lieutenants would live in them. 
"In case you haven't heard, I married the girl all the K.C.S used to razz me about when I was writing her in the old office at Walsh Hall, "We were married on Sept 21 and I became a proud papa, on Dec. 28, 1943, of a 9-pound boy who now totes the name of Joseph Bernard, which may I impress on your mind is not a junior. 
"I ^\-as going to have Kay join me when I found a place here but after one look at it I de­cided that it would be better for both her and the baby to stay in Tacoma. So now I am just praying that the war ends soon so I can get home and watch little Joe grow up. 
"Tom Courtney (De Kalb. III.) is here on the Held, and I understand some others, but so far I haven't met any others. Our chaplain is a secular priest who went to the Novitiate at N.D. He knows quite a few of the Fathers back there, and we have some great chats about the old place. 
"The other day I received my application for season tickets in football. Sure wish I could see one, but it doesn't look as if I will be anywhere near there this year. However, if I am still around here in November I am going to see Southern Cal play at Los Angeles. If you hear or know of anybody who is around Los Angeles. Heno or Las Vegas, let me know and we might be able to get together on a three-day pass some­time soon. My address, before it is forgotten: 422 AAFBU, Squadron E. Tonopah. Nev." 
Long wait, Joe, but worth it. Fine work. 

Here's a change post-carded in by Paul Dcery's dad from Indianapolis: "You will be interested in knowing that my son, Paul, is somewhere in France as he entered that country with the in­vading army from the south about a month ago-He is a first lieutenant now and still adjutant of his battalion." 
Another report from France comes air-mailed from Sgt. John C (Bill) Kirby. dated Aug. 16: 
"The last issue of the 'Alumnus' finally caught up with me—via Washington, of course. I haven't a heck of a lot of news but maybe you'll know something about a couple of us. That includes Tom Johnson (who used to travel with Sam Boyle, Engene O'Brien and company). We're both with the same replacement battalion. Tom's with headquarters, a staff sergeant and acting sergeant major, and I'm with the . . . company. 
"Several fellows from school have passed through here at different times. Lt. Leo Shields was the first we bumped into (in England). Hie next was a Lt. Terry, *41. cousin of Jim Feriy of our class. This is the first outfit I've been in where all the company officers are Catholic I guess there are more (Catholics in this company than any others around here anyway. 
"I wasn't fortunate enough to visit London or see Joe Luie or any of the old gang while in England. Maybe they'll be there on the way baek, though. I suppose you know Don O'Brien got mmr­ried. He's a lieutenant (jg) in the Naval Air Corps and last I heard was still at Kingsville, Tex. And how's Doc Cooney?" 
From Cleveland on Sept 7 came a note from 
E. M. Weinfurtner, Ed's dad: 
"I am wTiting you with regard to my son, Lt, (jg) Edward M. Weinfurtner, Jr., class of '42. His August 'Alumnus' has been received and 1 am fonvarding it to him as I have past issues, kno\ving that he is always glad to receive it. His address has been changed and is now. . . . He participated in the Southern France invasion which began on Aug. 15. This makes the fourth invasion he has participated in since he arrived in the Mediterranean area in May. 1943." 
"Somewhere in England," tbese lonr Notre Dame men and their guest chap­lain got together for a "swell meal/' ac­cording to a note, and this picture, from Joe Palmer, '42. Left to right are Chap­lain George Shea of Ascension parish, Chicago; Bob Kohne, ex. '46, Joe Palm­er, Dr. Eugene Smith, '38, the host, and Jim Gallagher, '31. 
"Jim's brother, Tom, '35, is in France and couldn't quite make it that night, to our regret," Joe wrote. 
Just missing the desdiine for the August 'Alumnus' came a report from New Guinea and Lt. Andy Chlebeck of the 5th Marines- He wrote: "While glancing through a recent issue of the 'Alumnus.' I ran across your address—so I'm writing. TTiis is the first issue I have seen since I left the states and it was given to me by-Jade Cole, ex. '41. Jack has been assigned to the squadron since January, but this was the first time for me to learn that we had something in common. 
"This present location has proved fruitful for me in that I have been able to run into three Notre Damers. Bemie Crimmins and Lany Kelly are stationed here and we manage to get together as often as our duties allow. I went out with Bemie on a run but unfortunate^'' ^'e spotted nothing and I was disappointed. Kelly is laid up with fungus infection and Paul Lillis is recover­ing from a wound he sustained as a result of get­ting too close to a Jap sniper. They are exi>ecting to go home shortly-I won't be eligible until next May." 
Then on Sept. 1 Andy, now a first lieutenant, air-mailed more information from the Southwest Pacific: 
". . . Yes, Joan Metzger and I finally got mar­ried on Jane 20 at the famous Miaaion of San Juan Capiatnno. the place where the swallows come back every year. Joan looked vo T kmrely in her lonff wedctinff gown—and to ns that was the happiest day of our life. 
"We lived in Carlsbad. Calif., about two months before I received my overseas orders. TTp until that time. I was the regimental athletic ^ rector for the 28th Marines. 5th Marine Division. The trip across was very dull, as I was one of the bojrs to set seasick. l%e dght of land was really welcomed by all hands aboard ship. We landed on a very beautiful island, but oar camp itself is located on a desert where the wind, dost, rain, blow 24 boors a day—every now ond thai we get a beauUful day. 
"I have been fortunate enous^ to continue my baseball career—and have been having a very good year—^hitting about .400 and lucky enough to be chosen on the all-star service team before being shipped over. We played, our first game on this island the other day and won, 14 to 0. It was my wife's birthday, so I had to celdirate by getting five-for-five, including a single, two doubles and two home runs, driving in seven rons and scoring five myself—probably the best day of my career at the plate. 
"I ran into JIM Bfartin the other day. He jost returned from (censored) and said things were jost a little rough over here, bnt the Marines did o.k. I have been hearing from Beraie Crian miaa. He hopes to be home for Christmas. He saw Bob HarYrave In New Zealand, also Faal LiUs and Kelly. They are all in the same squadron. Saw AngeW BcrtelU just before he shipped oat. Also Han y Wrigkt and Di d Kiaken." 
Another air-mail, from another part of the world, also just missed the August 'Alumnos.* It came from Capt. J. Howie EasidE, who is situ­ated with a B-29 outfit in India. He wrote on July 24: 
"Just received my June crapy of the 'Alomnu^ and sore enjoyed reading the whole thing. I would appreciate some news on some of my old &iends> I have seen only one Notre Dame man in the last year, that being Laa Bcmiah, '38. who is in my squadron. I'd tike to hear about Pete Kelly, Fkaak Dsady, Bab Ostenaan, Bfarty Sbea, my Serin Hall roomie, Jahn Halancy, Phil Sheridan. Jade O'Brien. Can't give you much news on myself, ScofV. but here's a brief running account of my three-year Army career: 
"After receiving my pilot wings, I instructed for six months in B-24s at TVicson, Ariz. fVom there I went into the first B-29 outfit formed and am still with it. I can't tell you much about the B-29, Scoop, as it is kept under wraps. I like it though and enjoy flying it. I also have a good crew and have been doing a little work against our little yellow 'friends.' I guess that's aboat all the news. Oh, yes, I married my home-town girl of Junior Prom and Senior Ball days—the event took place in February, 1943, in Texas." 
A V-mail letter, written Aug. 8, came bazring in from Italy and Bob Coleman: 
"Just a brief note to say I have picked my way through Cassino and Rome with SjSgU Jade Cackiey, '37, and T/Sgt. Frank Sbay. *35, Lt. J«e O'CanncIl, '41, and Pvt. Johnny Lyncb, '44. The latter two claim to have been the first two Notre Dame men in Rome. Shay and I claim to be 'sec­ond echelon* or the second batch of NJ>. men into Home Of course, a good deal of water has flowed under the bridge since that time. 
"I certainly would like to hear firom Lan y Hickey (a lieutenant (jg) in the Navy somewhere. Bab Siami (Marines); WaUy XcCMrt (Navy Air Corps), and Ed Danlevy (an aviator operating 
oft the .. . I believe), and Charlie Kaiser (still fighting the battle of Eau Claire. Wis.. I think). 
"Leo Tnrgrcxn has m-rried a jnrl in his cliiss at Med school at Creighton; Dick Sullivan can be reached as a corporal in . . . c/o Postmaster, San Francisco. What has become of Charlie (Scrip) Kirby, Wally HeeUn, Larr>' Kelly, Paul Lillis, Tom Walker. Bill Stnrbitts, Bill Keycs, Don Ho-Ran, Tom Xasfa, Dave Devins, Jim McVay, Neil McCarty* Chndc Kearney, et al. ? Did you know that Sam Boyle and Ned Weinfurtncr were in on the Normandy affair?" 
Some odds and ends: The press associations have carried a picture of an "Australian football reunion" in which Li. (js) Bemie Crimmins was shown visiting his former N-D. teammate. Lt. (ig) Paal Lillis, who was wounded by a Jap sniper during the invasion of the Admiralty Is­lands. Both are FT boat skipars. S!eve Bagarus was a star on the receiving end of forward passes from Sammy Baogh in the Washington Redskin Bast-West game at San Diego in early August. Lt. Bill Hofer. ex. N-D. quarterback, was one of 11 former football stars with a Marine regiment which smashed at Guam recently, according to the "Marine Corps Chevron" of Aug. 19. 
Good news to members of the class of M2 ^\-as announced on Aug. 24 when Lt. Col. Francis Ga­breski of Oil City, Pa., was reported alive and well in a Nazi prison camp. He was earlier be­lieved missing in action. He has bagged 31 Ger­man planes. 
From Maiden, Mass., comes a report from Charlie Tobin's sister, Virginia. She \vrites: 
"I for^vard the 'Alumnus' to Charlie ecch month —^iust as soon as I finish reading it myself. He tells me how much he looks forward to getting it. and seeing news of his friends and classmates in it. but he never sends any news of himself to you. so I. thinking that thoy too feel the same way. am taking it on myself to let you know the Intest news of him! 
"He's now a lieutenant, junior grade, and is skipper of a subchaser in the Caribbenn. In near­ly every letter we receive, he mentions some one of his Notre Dame friends that he has met in the various officers' clubs in that area. He spoke of meeting Jim Bmtz in Miami recently, and said that, since Jim also was a good friend of Matty Byrne and Herk Bereolos. the meeting was 'marked with no particular amount of gayetj'.' He met Don Connors in New York on h:s way back to Florida from a recent short-termed leave and Don was on his v.-ay to Mississippi. 
"Another friend of Charlie's, Tom Nash, is also a lieutenant, (jg), and in on a cruiser." 
Now T.ve swing back to an old friend, the chron­icler of ye La\yyers. Mrs. Ixira Lashbrook. who comes up with another news-ful contribution: 
"We've had some welcome visits from some of the lads. Among them were Lt. Charles Hasson, moving from a former assignment at Yale where he has been instructing ground crews in the Air Corps, to a similar job at Lowxy Field. Colo. He had some interesting stories to tell, among them the news of his ov.-n marriage to Miss Helen Brug of Sheridan. Wyo., which took place last Dec 23. 
"Ens. Joe Farmar sent a postcard from the subchaser base at Miami promising a long letter to follow. While we were waiting for the letter, 
•we learned from other sources that Joe had quite a harrowing expenence in the Atlantic not long ago but survived with no permanent injury. 
"Another welcome letter came from Capt Bob Salllvan promising us that he will be back to fin­ish that last year of law study and he hopes his return will not be too long postponed. He is ^vith the Air Corps in the European theater. He re­ported that he had just ser\-ed as a member of a general court martial hearing c~ses involving lar­ceny, manslaughter and A.W.O.L. charges. We're wondering who is going to teach whom when boys like Bob come back to law school! 
"One more 'delinquent* lawyer has been for­given with a letter this week from Jim Diver, with the artillery in France. He says there are four N.D. men in his division and that Father Murray is the chaplain with them. He asks again-for news of Jack Meyer and for his address. We have to tell him that the lust news we had of Jack \\-as his wedding announcement! 
"Bill Spangler is back in the deep South, after enjoying a brief furlough. His wife is living in Shreveport, La., while Bill is stationed at the base nearby. He told us that he telephoned John Baty's parents while he v.*as passing through Kansas City and was told that John, now an ensign, is living at Room 1112, North Columbus, Miami Beach, Fla. John was up this way awhile back but failed to make the promised visit to Notre Dame. Spangler is doing a bit of legal work too, just to keep a hand well occupied­
"Our Tarawa and Saipan hero, Lt. Jcscph Barr, USMC, wrote from Tinian reminding me that some legal reading matter would be most welcome. We assumed that he expected to have a bit of reading time, v.-hich he undoubtedly has not had for many months. 
"Harry Guthrie's girl friend wrote from Chey­enne. Wyo„ complaining that Harry has not been getting any mail from us. By now we hops the mail is getting through and that he has more m^il than he can read. 
"Confirmation of the report that Tim Maher has been given a medical discharge from the Army has reached us from Tim himself. He was physically retired from the Army in July and is now an attorney for a manufacturing firm in Pittsburgh. Tim was admitted to the Pennsyl­vania bar before he v.-as inducted so he lost no time in getting established. 
"Last week Ens. Jim McVay came in to see us (mid-September). He was en route back to his duty in the Pacific from a brief leav'e at home in Pennsylvania. Jim has seen quite a bit of ac­tive duty, and had a part in the invasion of Guam and the landing of troops and supplies there. He was uninjured but for at le::st one 24-hour period he was under air attack by the Japs while on a landing barge loaded with ammunition. He is not too optimistic about an early end to the war against Japan. 
"Ens. Jerrj' Feeney wrote recently from the West Coast, shortly after his return from a leave during which he visited here a few minutes. He is still on a destroyer in the Pacific. Lt. (jc) Fred Hoover wrote a week ago and sent us a copy of the Na\'y magazine which carried the story of the heroic action of Ens. Paul J. Kashmer last Feb. 7 in the Anzio landing, during which action Paul was killed. He received the Silver Star posthu­mously. Later Foul's parents and brother visited us here and showed us the two citations and the award which were sent to them by the Navy De­partment. 
"Lt. (jg) Jertj* Killigrew visited here recently and since then wrote from the West Coast to tell us that he ran into Jerry Feeney in San Diego. Feeney had checked in at the hotel and was walk­ing through the lobby when Killigrew sjiotted him. They exchanged news and arranged a meet­ing for the week-end. which was crincslled when Killigrew's ship left. Lt. Andy Chemey is still out in the Southwest Pacific with the Air Corps. He wrote quite a long letter recently describing some of the country out that way, but adding that he would trade the whole Pacific area for a visit to Notre Dame. 
"Jim Daner sent us an announcement of his marriage on July 14 to Dorothy Rita Haison from Michigan. The wedding was held in River­side, Calif., where Jim was then stationed. Ens. Bin Lawless, who has also been out in the Guam area, has recently been home on leave. He is now back on duty and his leave was too short to visit us that time. He spent the time in Buffalo with his bride and his parents. 
"Lt. Bill Hosinski wrote a short letter recently chiding me for the report in the last 'Alumnus' describing his bride as a blonde. He calls atten­tion to the fact that she is and has always been, as far as he knows, a red head. It seems useless to argue that Webster's Unabridged Dictionary defines 'blondes' to include persons with red hair. Whatever classification she comes under, she is definitely a very beautiful girl, and almost de­serving of a fine fellow like Bill. Bill reports having seen Capt. Pat Bannon at Kelly Field. Bannon is assigned to AAF Headquarters in Washington. Hosinski v.-as especially interested in any news I might have of Bill Hogan, but unfortunately I had none. 
"Ens. Jade Lawler wrote this month from the Pacific. He expects a leave this fall and promis3S to spend a few hours at Notre Dame. Anita Lav­ery. Joe's wife, wrote from Denver to say that Joe is in France with the invasion forces. Having no news of him since the invasion started other than this, we feel sure that Joe came through so far without injury. She enclosed a photograph of their two-year-old son and she says it will be a shock to the baby to learn that his father is some­thing more than a photograph in a frame. 
"Leo Linck is still learning to be a soldier in the Air Corps at San Antonio. Texas. Lt. James 
D. Lancaster visited us recently too. He is doing personnel work in the Army, adjusting assign­ments of men who have been placed in jobs for which they are unsuited. His station is Robins Field, Ga. 
"Lt. Ray Qainn tells us that he e.\p2cts to be home soon from the air war in Europe. He warned that when the war ends there will be four of the Quinn boys in school at the same time! Capt. John Verdonk was another N.D. vis­itor, being home on a 30-day leave and in time to welcome his new son who was born during the leave. John expected several weeks ago to be sent overseas for a confidential mission but at the time of this writing it hadn't materialized yet. Vail Fisdike has accepted a position with a law firm in Washington, D. C, and reported for work the first week in August. Vail passed the Indiana Bar examinations in July and was ad­mitted to practice. Pete Nemeth also passed the examinations and was admitted with Vail. Pete is practicing in South Bend. 
"Walt Ivancevic, now with the Equity Corpora­tion in New York, passed the New York bar ex­aminations in June was by now expected to join a firm of attorneys on Wall Street. 
"Jim McGoldrick, now with the FBI, in New York, has applied to take the New York exami­nation. He wrote in mid-September for the neces­sary certifications and incidentally gave us the first information about his location that we have had for a long time." 
And here comes a newsy report from Brooklyn, of all places, authored by Charlie Conger: 
"Just thought I'd drop a line and let you know about some of the N.D. boys I've run across in this section of the country.

Hugh was stationed in England several months prior to the D-Day invasion and mentioned seeing several Notre Dame friends there. He also men­tioned seeing some in the Mediterranean area. Hugh is quite well, very enthusiastic about his work, and through the mercy of God, yet un­harmed.

From Walt HcNamarm (on July 15): "It was the twelfth of this month that a Notre Dame 'Alumnus' reached me and reading about all the fdlows made me a little homesick for the campus life again.

From Al Oliver: "I've been threatening to get in touch with you for many months, but it took the receipt of the April and June 'Alumnus' from home to get me on the ball.

The following by S/Sgt. Dick Gordon, a Ma­rine Corps Combat Correspondent, formerly of the "Chicago Daily News.** is about a boy who spent a short time on the campus as a student: 
Somewhere in the Pacific—(Delayed)—^A Ma­rine regiment is standing by at this island base-The men who helped crack the Jap defenses at Eniwetok will meet that enemy again one of these days. And sometime, in the bitter moments which inevitably lie ahead, they'll think back to the quiet, selfless heroism of a young platoon ser­geant. 
lliey'll remember Johnny K. Walih, of Pueblo. Colo., Boys Town, Nebr., and Notre Dame Uni-verity, and how he took over their leaderless and disorganized platoon on the beach at Engebi and. by bis own example, picked them up by the boot straps for a drive that smashed the Japs to defeat 
Some will recall, too, one of the few sx>eeches ever made by the taciturn platoon sergeant. He was talking about different ways of getting men to follow a leader into battle. He said: "If you fellows ever refuse to follow me. I'll make my­self such a target to the Japs I know you'll come along to keep me from getting killed." He had that much courage himself and that much confidence in his men. 
Platoon Sergeant Walsh never had to make good that threat. His platoon never lagged, but even so, its leader was always out in front where the action was the hottest. 

The Engebi island invasion was followed by that of Parry four days later. Enemy snipers and mortir fire was heavy, but Platoon Sergeant Walsh and his men kept going forward. Late one afternoon they were advancing along the beach across the island. Hiey were working their way down toward the final ]>ocket of resistance. Pla­toon Sergeant Walsh was several yards in the van when he yelled, "Come on, eveiything's O.K..*' 
Just then a Jap machine gun, concealed on a fringe of sand and underbrush, opened up. Pla­toon Sergeant Walsh died three hours later in a foxhole. 
Fellow officers and men know Platoon Sergeant Walsh as a gentleman and a devout Catholic. Hie lieutenant in charge of his old platoon de* fined him as an efficient leader, as fine a man as he ever knew, absolutely clean, morally and phy­sically. 
Tlie men who served with him for many months of training in the Pacific think of him as "a dam «ood guy," whran everyone liked and respected. And that other platoon of which he assumed command when its officer was killed in the land­ing on Engebi cannot say enough in praise of Platoon Sogeant Walsh.. 
"We were badly disorganized when he took over," one of them related. "He didn't waste a lot of words. He jtist said, 'Come on,' told us irtiat to do, and showed us the way. And on Parry it was he who made us get off the beach. If he had not Jap mortars would have killed us all" 
Ihe colonel commanding his battalion thousht so highly of Platoon Sergeant Walsh after En­gebt that he recommended his field promotion to second lieutenant. Ihe recommendation was awaiting final approval by higher authorities when the officer>to-be was killed on Parry. 
Lt. Don McGnuin has recently been decorated with the Air Medal in recognition for achieve­ment while participating In aerial flights in the Southwest Pacfic area from Nov. 24 to Dec 31. 1943. Lt. (Jv) Chariea Kane is also serving in the Southwest Pacific

CpL Bob Livinsstone, Carter said, was also en route. Ray Sdioster was in It­aly, while Larry Winter was somewhere in Car­ter's neighborhood on a boat.

Johnny BaoB was in Italy and had encountered Bob Casey. Jia Lrndgrf was in England, as of June last, and with him were Jsa Radd and Bin Kenney.

(Reports of a Mathematical Colloquium. Notre Dame Mathematical Lectures.) 
IVTATHEMATICS takes a unique place among the 
sciences. The mathematician does not need labora­
tories as the physicist and biologist do, nor observatories 
as does the astronomer. A pencil and a sheet of paper aie 
his only tools. With these he achieves results of real per­
manence if he is given time to ponder his problems and 
opportimity to communicate his results to other mathema­
ticians. Ideas of old Egypt, Greece, and Arabia that have 
come to us, are still "alive in the mathematics of our time. 
To allow mathematicians time, to concentrate on un­solved problems, to issue periodicals summarizing the re­sults of mathematical research, and to publish lectures in order to make their content available to those who are un­able to attend them — these are some of the few and simple ways of promoting mathematics. 
Mathematicians at Notre Dame and elsewhere grate­fully recognize diat the University has generously promoted the science in all these ways. 
In 1937 the undersigned was invited to continue at Notre Dame the publication of a periodical "Ergebnisse eines Mathematischen Kolloquiums" which he had pub­lished from 1929-1936 while professor at the University of Vienna, Austria. Before the war, four yearly issues of these "Reports of a Mathematical Colloquium" were pub­lished. The main contents were the results of two research projects carried on af Notre Dame: Metric Geometry, and a new foundation of Non-Euclidean Geometry. Papers on topological questions and a frequently quoted note on mathematical logic were also included. 
The war has aifected the Department of Mathematics' possibly more than any other department. The number of students in elementary and intermediate courses has dou­bled, tripled, quadrupled. In connection with the Navy's large V-12 program at Notre Dame new courses were instituted, new methods of teaching had to be developed. Administrative problems consumed most of the spare time of the mathematicians remaining on the campus while some younger colleagues were called away to do war research or to join the armed forces. 
In spite of these difficulties, a board consisting of Rev. Howard Kenna, C.S.C., Dr. A. N. Milgram, Dr. P. M. Pepper, and the undersigned started a second series of pubUcations, the "Notre Dame Mathematical Lectures." The first issue contains lectures of Professor A. Wald (Columbia University) about the fundamental ideas of modem statistics, the second is devoted to lectures of Pro­fessor E. Artin (Indiana University) on Galois Theory. Both pamphlets have been very favorably reviewed, and have found a wide distribution. Graduate seminars of large universities have used them as texts. 
Issues 3 and 4 of the series will be published during the fall of 1944. Issue 3 will be devoted to lectures on "Alge­bra of Analysis" by Karl Menger, and issue 4 will be a pamphlet containing three lectures delivered at the occasion of the Notre Dame meeting of the American Mathematical Association at which Professor L. R. Ford (Illinois Insti­tute of Technology) spoke on Nomography, Professor A. 
H . Copeland (University of Michigan) on Calculus of Probability, and Professor Artin on Complex Functions. 
Further pamphlets of the Mathematical Lectures, as well as Issue 5 of the Reports are in preparation.
