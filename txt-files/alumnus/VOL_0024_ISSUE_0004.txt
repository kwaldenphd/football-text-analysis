Editorial (s)* 
In a crowded issue of a crowded era, the ALUMNUS is definitely embarrassed by a lack of space and a lack of tra­dition for editorial expression on things of the moment that can only be expressed editorially. 
Father O'Donnell 

It would be a grave injustice to allow the outstanding administration of Rev. J. Hugh O'Donnell, C. S. C, '16, to end without a sincere expression of appreciation from alumni for his leadership of Notre Dame during one of its most' critical periods. This is multiplied by the constructive programs which he maintained or introduced during this period, in which every alumnus takes both credit and pride. And it would be unjust to Father O'Donnell not to express alumni appreciation for his aggressive patronage of the Alumni Association. If that seems an odd expression, it is nevertheless a happy one. For the alumni have always been a keen source of interest and encouragement to Father O'Donnell in his administrative posts in the University. He has recognized in them the institutional sine qua non of progress. And he has not only lent his talents and his friendship to alumni success—he has demanded it, rightly and effectively. 
Father Cavanaugh 

And it would be equally amiss not to extend to Rev. John 
J. Cavanaugh, C. S. C, '23, successor in the able parade of alumni-presidents, the sincere welcome of fellow-alumni everywhere. And as sincere is the conviction that he will find in the Alumni Association and its members the same support, the same consideration, which alumni have given to his predecessors. Alumni ai-e aware of the problems and the opportunities which confront Notre Dame and its leaders, and are prepared and educated now in the part the grad­uate plays in the various phases of development. 
The 1946 Fund 

Editorial mortal an would be committed if the AXUJINUS did not extend to the alumni sincere gratitude for the 194C response to the Fourth Annual Alumni Fund, already, in mid-year, at a new high in the number of contributors, and well on its way to a new high in amount contributed. The significance of the success of this particular Fund as both a tribute to the program of Father O'Donnell and a wel­come to the program of Father Cavanaugh is evident. 
The Record Enrollment 
Some editorial comment is indicated concerning the rec­ord-breaking enrollment in September. Many boys, not a few of them from the families of alumni and friends of the University, have found it impossible to be accommodated for September. The University has stretched its facilities 
to the utmost. At the request of the Alumni Board, special consideration has been given to relatives of alumni, within bounds of scholastic records, date of application, and the increasing pressure of the returning Notre Dame G. I. One note for alumni consideration is this: Notre Dame's facil­ities are not as flexible, with the University acting in. loco parentis, with all its implications of moral, spiritual and physical welfare in addition to the mental, as are the facil­ities of those schools which take only academic responsibil­ity for students. And September facilities already point to enrollment 40 per cent above the desired ceiling, indicating 
that Notre Dame is not unaware of the emergency. 
The Ticket Situation 

There is one other subject of editorial importance— Army tickets. At this writing, the United Nations and the OPA are running behind it in significance. There will also be a few headaches in other games—^Navy, Southern Cali­fornia, Tulane, for example. But using the Army game as the symbol, the ALUMNUS feels obligated to call attention to several significant facts. The bona fide alumni prefer­ence list, under the 1946 plan announced by the Athletic Department and the Alumni Association, (and including the 
C. S. C. religious-alumni,) has gone over the 5,000 mark for the first time in history. 
Now, if each of these eligible contributors ordered just the four tickets to which he is entitled, it would exhaust the complete alumni section in the Notre Dame stadium with an 8,000-ticket deficit, with quite a few of the alumni-pre­ferred orders filled behind the goal line. Similarly, the maximum position would call for more tickets to the Navy game than the total allotment to Notre Dame by Navy. The demand would leave so few tickets for the Army game that the additional order of four general public tickets could not be met from the total Notre Dame supply. 
Normally, many contributors do not order for all games. But this note is listed to serve as a reminder that every­tliing in reason is being done at Notre Dame to work with the Alumni Association in extending to alumni who have given tangible evidence of interest in Notre Dame the cour­tesy of a preference in the allotment of tickets to the foot­ball games. But in view of the numbers involved, all tickets are not going to be on the 50-yard line. And many alumni, underestimating the picture, may be disappointed seriously by the physical limitations of the games. 
One last editorial comment—^in the opportunities of the cultural and spiritual lives of all of us, there are not the same ceilings and limited capacities that exist in previous paragraphs. If you get a sincerely regretted "No" from Notre Dame in those areas, remember that there are other fields in which we can and will gladly say "Yes."

The Notre Dame Alumnus 
Owosso, IDch., in 1899, a son of the 
late Michael and Mary (Keegan) Cava­
naugh, has been associated with Notre 
Dame since 1917. During his first two 
years at the University he served as pri­
vate secretary to the late Rev. John W., 
Cavanaugh, C. S. C, president of Notre 
Dame. They were not related, however. 
Later he was private secretary to the 
late Very Rev. James A. Burns, C. S. C, 
assistant superior general and a former 
president of Notre Dame. Before com­
ing to Notre Dame, Father John J. Cav­
anaugh had served as secretary to Mr. 
Liebold, private secretary to Henry 
Ford. 
Following his graduation from Notre 
Dame in 1923, he worked in the sales

Notre Dame and in July, 1933, was ap­
pointed assistant prefect of religion, 
to succeed the new president of Notre 
Dame elected at that time, the Rev. John 
F. O'Hara, C. S. C, now bishop of Buf­falo, N, Y. He held that post until his appointment as vice-president in 1940, in which position he also was chairman of the Faculty Board in Control of Ath­letics. 
The new Notre Dame president has two brothers, Rev. Francis Cavanaugh, 
C. S. C, dean of the College of Arts and Letters at Notre Dame, and Mich­ael, Jr., of Lansing, Mich., and a sister, Ann, residing in Chicago. 
Ft-her Murphy was bom July 18, 1912, at Racine, Wis., son of the late John H. Murphy and Gertrude Bau­mann Murphy. He attended St. Pat­rick's parochial school in Racine and in 1926 entered the Holy Cross Seminary at Notre Dame. After attending the Uni­versity for two years, he began his study of theology and philosophy at the Gre­
gorian University in Rome, Italy. 
Ordained in December, 1938, at Rome, Father Murphy then pursued fur­ther graduate studies in scripture at the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome dur­ing 1939-40. At the outbreak of Worid War H he returned to the United States. He continued his scripture studies at the Catholic University of America, Wash­ington, D. C, in 1940-41. 
Froni 1941 to 1943 Father Murphy served as director of vocations at the Holy Cross Seminary on the Notre Dame campus. In the latter year he was appointed superior at Moreau Seminary.

A number of brothers have elected to remain under the direction of the priests' province in the United States, directed by Rev. Thomas Steiner. 
SOUTH BEND PASTORS SHIFT 
Always of interest to alumni are the Holy Cross pastorates in South Bend. Expiration of canonical terms brought about a substantial change in the 1946 obediences. 
Rev. Wendell P. Corcoran, '07, leaves St. Joseph's parish to become pastor of S t Patrick's. Rev. Philip Beaghan, '19, pastor of Holy Cross parish, succeeds Father Corcoran.

lOlst Commencement Is Colorful Affair 
Small Class and Large Program Mark Resumption of 
Annual Commencement Weekend; Addresses of Car­
dinal Stritch, Sokolsky and Mallon are Impressive 
The University resumed on June 28­29-30 the formal annual observance of Commencement, suspended with the 100th Annual Commencement October 29, 1943.. The 1946 Commencement also marked the ending of the acceler­ated program. The University returns to two 18-week semesters beginning in September, with an eight-week summer session opening in 1947. 
Graduate and undergraduate degrees conferred totalled 235. In addition, 135 members of the naval E.O.T.C. unit at 
N. D. were commissioned ensigns in the Navy, (133) as second lieutenants in the Marine Corps, (two) at the Com­mencement ceremonies. Vice-Admiral William D. Murray, commandant of the Ninth Naval district presented the com­missions and spoke briefly. 
The brilliant addresses of Cardinal Stritch, the baccalaureate preacher; George Sokolsky, the Commencement speaker; Rev. Hugh O'Dohnell, C.S.C., president and Faiil Mallon, at the Alum­ni Banquet, are all presented in this is­sue. One of their major virtues is the contribution they make to the thinking that the Alumni Association has tried to stimulate among alumni in the-fields of religion and citizenship. 
Alumni activities were again a vital part of the weekend, in spite of uncer­tainties that made Bill Dooley refer to the weekend as "Operation Cross-fingers." 
While there was no effort made to specify Classes for Reunions, the Class News in this issue will show many active groups, especially 1921, 1931 and 1941 of the five-year cycle, and 1943 and 1944 of the war years. Major Class event was the 1931 smoker at the In­diana Club on Friday night. 
The University golf course and the lake received constant attention on the Indiana summer • days the weekend brought. 
Friday night was music night, with 

the University band in concert on the 
main quadrangle followed by a formal 
Glee Club concert in Washington Hall. 
A solemn memorial Mass for the 313 Notre Dame dead of World War H was celebrated by Father O'Donnell in Sac­red Heart Church at 9 o'clock on Sat­urday morning. • ; 
Following the Mass, the senior class observed its traditional Last Visit and then proceeded to Washington Hall fpr the annual Class Day exercises and award of prizes. 
At 3 P. M. Notre Dame rewarded; a large baseball crowd on Cartier Field with a victory over Great Lakes. 
At 6 o'clock came the Alumni Ban­quet in the East Hall of the University Dining Halls. Approximately 500 alum­ni were present to hear the inspiration­al addresses of the distiiiguished Notre Dame columnist, Paul S. l^Ion, and the president of the University, Father O'Donnell, and to listen attentively to the fact-packed report of Alumni PKsi­dent Thomas F. Byrne, also presented in full in this issue. There was, despite excessive heat, an attention, and an at­mosphere which seems indicative of the 
growth of the scope.-and the concept of alumni identity in^.-the University pic­ture. President "Byrne presided at a head table whichJin^ addition to Father O'Donnell and -I^.ul Mallon, included Mr. Sokolsky, Father.; Cavanaugh, alum­ni laj' trustees;\BejTiard VoU and Tim Galvin, Rev. i)r. 5JI. L. Moriarty (Fa­ther Mike, th'at.^is)-; Msgr. Barry, and the secretariat; Dobley and Armstrong. 
Another adapfetionyto continuing short-• 
ages was the. presence of Moreau sem­inarians waiting.on^table. (The Alumni Office had been'pr.eparing the returnees for cafeteria style,'.'but the University and the semiriary-'joihed forces to re­store a more ordeflyv.deliverj'- of an ex­
cellent dinner.) • •'^C;'; 
The band rep'eated'Hits quadrangle concert on SaturSay,- ;night, and the Commencement guests^ were} treated to an outstanding performarure lof "The Mikado," by the Savoyards.of the Uni­versity Theater under the direction of 
C. E. Birder, '13, a show alreadyhighly popularized in a series of late i;spring performances for students and St'.-Jo­seph Valley friends.

AWARD TO SULLIVAN 
Atmual presentation of the lay fac­ulty award was made to Richard Sullivan, '30, professor of Eng'ish, at Commencement exercises on June 30. The presentation, wliich has not been made since 1943, when it was awarded to Dr. John A. Scaimell, head of the Physical Education De­partment, consists of a $500 purse. It is awarded by the Alumni Associa­tion for distinguished achievement by a lay faculty member. 
Prof. Sullivan, author, critic and playwright, has had many short' stories and two novels published. He regularly contributes book reviews to the Neto York Times and the Chi-' cago Tribune. He joined the Notre Dame faculty in 1936.

Once more the United States flag, presented to the University by the grad­uates, was blessed and raised on the quadrangle after the Mass.

At 2 o'clock Sunday afternoon, the graduating class was tendered a recep­tion for parents and guests in the lounge of the Rockne Memorial by the University administration. 
The Navy Drill Hall furnished the background for the final event of the colorful weekend, the Conferring of De­grees. Highlight was, of course, the address of George Sokolsky, New York columnist. But the conferring of the honorary doctorates, the graduate and undergraduate degrees, and the citation to the University from the Navy Depart­ment for its war program, provided a full program and a fitting climax. 
BUDENZ LEAVES FACULTV 

Louis F. Budenz, who renounced Com­munism last fall and returned to the Roman Catholic faith, has left the Notre Dame faculty because, he and his family sought climatic relief from acute sinu­sitis. They are now residing in a New York City suburb and Mr. Budenz is an assistant professor of economics at Ford­ham University. 
Mr. Budenz, former editor of the Daily Worker, New York Communist news­paper, conducted classes in elementary journalism and served as an assistant professor of economics at Notre Dame. He was engaged also in writing a book which deals •with his leaving Commun­ism to again become a Catholic. The book, entitled "This Is My Story," will be released on Oct. 11, the first anni­versary of his return to the church. 
OBSERVER AT BIKINI 

Dr. Milton Burton, professor of chem­istry at Notre Dame, served as an official observer for the United States govern­ment at the atomic bomb tests at Bikini in the Pacific late in July. 
The Notre Dame professor, who has an international reputation for his work in the field of photochemistry, has been associated for the last four years •with thie Manhattan Atomic Bomb project.

The Commencement Address 
By George E. Sokolsky. LLD.. "46 ''•­
Speaking on the Subject, "The Clash of Civilizations" the Widely Known Columnist and Lecturer Warns the 1946 Graduates? of the "Blow to Human Aspirations" Inherent in the Russian System. 
May I throw my mind back to the year 1917 when I, like you today, faced the prospect of the commencement of life on my own. My school days were over. The world was at war. The hopes of youth were high. The United States had under­taken the noble mission of making the world safe for Democracy. Our sons were embarking for Europe to fight to end all wars. 
I, full of zeal and optimism, left this, my native land, to go to Russia, where at that moment, a small group of demo­cratically-speaking idealists were fever­ishly, attempting to establish representa­tive government in a land accustomed to despotism. I wanted to be an eye­witness to that upsurge of Western civ­ilization in that Eastern country. I want­ed to be part of that movement for hu­man liberty. 
I remained in Russia long enough to see a republic transformed into a Soviet; to witness the brutal destruction of even a feeble effort toward representative gov­ernment; to witness the extirpation of liberty and the revival of slavery; to hear serfdom called human rights, and despotism, progress. 
Dieams Shattered 

This was a shattering experience for a young man. In the years of my school­ing, I had seen ancient peoples desert despotic political forms. China, Turkey, Japan, Persia—ancient Eastern civiliza­tions—^found new hopes in new ways of life. Russia was to be the rich experi­mental ground. Could the Western con­cept of the rights of man ultimately overcome the Eastern concept of the div­inity of .the ruler, the despot, the.auto­crat, the absolute master of men, the su­preme State? 
The success of the Bolshevik Revolu­tion shattered the hopes of many, like my­self, who dreamed of a world of liberty, of a world in which every human being would possess freedom of will, freedom of choice, freedom of conscience as a fundamental human right which no gov­ernment, no ruler, no State could limit or impair. The failure of liberty in Rus­sia was a blow to human aspirations. It was a retreat from the West. Since that day in October, 1917, when the Winter 
Palace in Petrograd fell to the Bolshe­viks, the whole of mankind has witnessed an unending war of civilization, a clash • bet^veen two uncompromising and un- /, compromisable ways of life, between the .: rule of God and the rule of despotic men, y: between liberty and slavery. ^ i':^. 
George E. Sokolsky 
II 

It is to this clash of civilizatiohslthat I now desire to address myself; ^EoijI each of us in this generation, this .war ,will be continuous throughout our lives arid we shall have to take sides hiej^eafter, as we have been forced to take,sides during the past two decades, on allithe issues and implications that arise "from it. 
Man is Enriched 

Westei'n civilization-is-a continuous process for the enlightenment of indi­vidual man, for freeiiigVhis personality from bondage, for the^enrichment of his life by bringing his spirit closer to God that he may not as aclod'iipon the earth gaze everlastingly on its»br6wn contours, but facing the sun; stand.^erect, head high and purpose freeijhjs ,yision focus­sed beyond the blueJ'rfOthe Heavens where in his hopes and^aspirations he

' 'Tjie roots of this intellectual and spir­itualjgrowth of the Western man lie deep . ^Q^^I^!^ ^'1 o^ Palestine, Greece and Rome. 
..It^.was in Zion that the Psalmist sang: .;,'^'"What is man, that thou art mindful :~>]pf him? and the son of man, that thou •-{visitest him? 
"For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour. 
"Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet: . . ." 
Each is bidiTidual 

Man is not a biologic creature, a test-tube experiment, a thing to be connted and placed in categories; he is not like other forms of nature functioning by in­stinct, possessing no choice, knowing nei­ther good nor evil, moving endlessly in a single direcion, his fate predetermined by mechanistic forces. 
Aristotle said: "Let us acknowledge . . . that each one has just so much of happiness as he has of virtue and wis­dom, and of virtnons and wise action 
It is each one of us, riot the mass, nor the multitude, nor majorities, or minori­ties, which possesses virtue—and each one of us separately and on his own as an individual. 
And further the Philosopher said: "Moral purpose is clearly soriiething vol­untary . . ." But a voluntary, action can only be taken by a free individual, by one who is not coerced, not driven, not fearful of power. The slave cannot take a voluntary step; he obeys his master, as a dog obeys his master. One curses; the other growls; bat both obey. 
And so in the Western World, the con­cept of human freedom—of liberty for the individual—became the object of a moral system. For whereas in the East man obeys fearfully, in the West he places moral restraints and obligations upon himself that he might enjoy the fruits of liberty without suffering the

and law. Whereas to us these safeguard the liberties and dignities of the indi­vidual, to the new armies of the Apoca­lypse they represent mountainlike im­pediments to the subjection of man to the will of the State—^to those who have seized and hold the power of the State. 
For it is the State that is being erect­ed as the prison for the spirit of man. The'State that was evolved in the West as the protector of the rights of the in­dividual is being twisted into an instru­ment of coercion, of persecution, of purge, of torture, of enslavement. In Germany, these forces used the name of Nazism; in Russia, of Communism; in Italy of Fascism. By whatever name, they possess the same general chai-acter­istic: they cruelly strip man of person­ality, crush his spirit, reduce him to a thing and set over him the State—as master over slave, as an overlord that guarantees a minimum of' material se­curity for the complete and total sur­render of his liberty and dignity. The in­dividual becomes an indistinct, black-out item in an inchoate mob. He is lost.

The United States was founded on the liberal principles of the Judaic-Chris­tian civilization. Its roots are in the Bible. The Fathers of this country ad­dressed themselves to the individual and his human rights derived from God and Nature's Laws. The Declaration of In­dependence declares: 
"We hold these truths to be self-evi­dent, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights. Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed . . ."

In this country, then, the State is not our master; it is our instrument. Those who manage the State are not our rul­ers; they are our servants. The residium of authority, the core of right is the in­dividual man, created by God and vested by Him but not by the State with equal­ity before the law. 
. To insure the permanent acknowledge­ment of the rights of man and to place positive limitations upon government, the Constitution was adopted as a safe­guard not only against the tyranny of one overpowering ruler but against the even more devastating tyranny of the majority. The Constitution of the United States, particularly. its Bill of Rights, recognizes, as no other similar (Continued on page 20)

The Baccalaur^ilt Sermon 
By Samuel Cardinal Stritch. LL.D^.'\'!4^ 

' 'y '^- ."' "Love Is the Great Power in Our Lives,*i<'tftevA'rcHbishop of Chicago Says, as He Admonishes GraduatVs to Con­cern Themselves With the Common; Goodv.cif Society. 
The thought uppermost in your minds this morning is: What must I do to make my life thoroughly and uncom­promisingly Christian, or, to love God with my whole soul and my neighhor as myself? Leaving this great school to­day, where you have diligently sought to prepare yourselves for abundant liv­ing, you are trying to evaluate objective­ly your assets of personality, your po­tentialities as sons of God, and your de­ficiencies, that you may plan rightly your Christian living. Some of you have in­terrupted your years of preparation to do your part in the defense of our fi'ee­doms in the greatest of wars, and these among you have had valuable experience in testing themselves. 
This is the great serious moment of graduation—^the moment in which, be­fore receiving your degrees, you pause to stand face to face with your God and prayerfully look out on your future. It may be helpful to you if I suggest to you some thoughts. Plainly I must leave unsaid many things which are common­place in your Christian training and limit myself to a few thoughts which may have escaped you, not because they are recondite, but because in my obser­into the planning of Christian lives of vation so frequently they do not enter college graduates. 
Today each one of you kneels before God, conscious of his high dignity and calling as a son of God. You look into yourself, and you find natural gifts and supernatural gifts. You know that all life is given you that you may perfect and enrich your persons and one day present them in judgment before your God. Full well you understand that very living is a tremendous responsibility. Saint Jerome tells us that it is hard to be a good Christian, but courage is yours, 
• because you know that there is. always the strength that is needed and the light' from the Cross. No stupid paralyzing, depression is in you. High optimism ob­tains. Today you are simply looking ouf on the opportunities before you, confident that with the grace of God you will grasp them and get all the gold that is in them. The pagan philosopher, in his conviction. that virtue is the highest achievement in life, might havg-lpojced out from the vantage point of fUll^y^rahg. manhood with fear, knowing thgi'difflcul­ties ahead of him and the weaknessesiin 
him. • .-r ii'.' 
You, in full realization of youi'j jlignity as sons of God, have no such :fear:,.bei cause, you know that with Godfsv-gface there is no unconquerable difBcultyJSheiECd of you. You are right. Never^jimi^.Mear young men, lose the smile and 'ihel opti­mism which belongs,to ChristianOliyi'ng.

is love. Love is the greatjpoyrer'invour lives. Oiir Blessed Savidr/^stre^es-.this fact. Christian life essentially-^isl^anjact of love of God. EverytHmgjin'jitl allf-its triumphs, all its^vhar/fshipsi-faluits-' dis­
appointments, all its consolations, are 
things of love. Now love manifests itself 
in giving. The philosophers speak of the 
benevolence and the beneficence of the 
lover. The son of God must engag^e in 
constant giving. It is a Christian para­
dox that we enrich ourselves by giving 
ourselves away. Keep this thought con­
stantly in your mind that all yonr lives 
must be spent in giving yourselves away. 
And to whom? Now all the giving of the 
son of God is giving to God. In Baptism 
you were dedicated to God. In Confirm­
ation you were made soldiers of the 
Christ King. No matter who may be the 
immediate recipient of your giving, it 
always must be giving to the Christ 
King. He must reign in your hearts, and 
in your minds, and in your wills. Yon 
must learn each day better and better 
how to live with Him and how to will 
with Him. In the loyalty and bravery of 
soldiers in His army, you must give al­. ways of yourself to yonr King. 
It is in this loye of the Christ King 

that you come to realize that loving Him 
is loving with Him. We must love what 
.He loves, and we must seek what He 
seeks. How easy it is to understand that 
we must love our neighbor. This love is 
not different from our love of God but 
is comprehended in it. Almighty God 
placed us in the society of men. Not one 
of us is self suflScient, even for the needs 
of his nature. We are dependent nppn 
our fellowmen. Even spiritually we'de­
pend on others, for very many of the 
virtues postulate our living in society 
with our fellowmen. Divine Providence 
wills that we perfect ourselves and carry 
out our vocation as sons of God living 
in justice and charity with our fellow­
men. This is how God wants us to serve 
the Christ King. 
Now let us look at our social responsi­bilities as sons of God. It is not enough .to seek your own interests in your ca­reers. We satisfy our own interests in serving the interests of others. It is a fact that the tragedy which has come to the world has come because of the blind selfishness of Christian men. They en­graged in private businesses, they used their talents in inventions and in im^ proved techniques of business and com­

-are poor lands or undeveloped lands is a 'fact. Democracy is not something which happened in its full reality among us when the Constitution was ratified by 
; theStates. Its Christian principles are the constant in it, and its dynamism is 
'.i n always trying in* changing circum­stances forthe complete successful ap­plication ofthese principles. 
Jefferson spoke of our, experiment in 

free institutions. We have problems be­. fore us today which are a challenge to . our democratic thinking. They must be. 
solved in thelight of Christian truth. The forces ofmaterialism must not pre­vail. 'It is true that Christian truth is indestructible, because it is truth, but it 
• isalso true that sometimes it has had to live in catacombs. The question before us 
-today is: Are we going to surrender our. Christian social and • political culture largely through the. inaction and lethar­
" gy of .Christian men? Dare we make . • again the mistake which Christian men

 made in thepast? The intelligent ac­: .'.tion of soils of God can give us endur­

win the revolution remains to be seen. We might as well be realistic. We might-as well admit that although the wprld'.is well rid of one kind of totalitarianism, it is still beset by another kind, a vicious' ideology that has the same callous con­tempt for the sacredness and dignity of the human personality that the Nazis and Fascists had. The idea that I refer to is Communism. 
The danger of Communism to America is real; it is imminent. True, the Com­munists in the United States are rela­tively few in number, but what they lack in numbers they more than make up for in organization. They are astute, tough-minded propagandists with a power and influence far greater than their numer­ical strength would indicate. 
Siate-ism Rampant 

Communism is materialistic—that is, atheistic. It denies God, and hence basic morality. To Communism, man is an ani­mal who comes out of nothingness and returns to nothingness. The world of Communism is a totalitarian world in which man exists for the state, and not the state for man as man's agent for the protection of God's gifts of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. This is the world of state-ism—the world of Com­munist Russia, Nazi Germany, and Fas­scist Italy. 
The United States is especially suscep­tible to the inroads of Communism jiist now because, whether we like it or not. the pattern of state-ism has been in the making for the past fifteen or twenty years; and the pattern was accelerated during the war. We have too easily sur­rendered local authority and local re­sponsibility, forgetting that good govern­ment begins at home. But we cannot say that the Federal Government ^\Tested our prerogatives from us. We gave them up voluntarily. We have been running to Washington with problems that our fore­fathers, as a matter of course, would have solved for themselves. The result is a federalization that not even Alex­ander Hamilton himself ever dreamed of. Industry, banking, agriculture now have their center in Washington, and Wash­ington, too, dictates the food and health and insurance customs of the nation. I said the pattern of state-ism is in the making. I should have said that it has been made. 
To put it bluntly, we have played into the Communists' hands. They plan a world revolution. They know exactly what they want, and they will follow any course that will bring them closer to their goal. They even give aid to the nations they hope eventually to over­

the field of truth. Make her face the facts. This can be done not alone by' the statesman or the newspaperman, but by you business people, educators, and priests. She has been at her game 25 years. But we have been at onis 175 years, indeed for neariy 2,000 years. Seek out the truth about things. Know it.

"For just as she is weak in this field, we are strong. The Christian way of ^lifeis the right way of living by all natural law. The principles of Chris­tian, civilization, are the proper prin­-ciples.from the standpoint of indi-vidoal l^rning,' success, health, peace and KsTppiness.

"Christianity teaches as its funda­
mental doctrine the freedom of the in­
dividual spirit, the freedom of the soul, 
the freedom of conscience. It relies 
upon reason—and TRUTH. Its appeal 
is to an even-handed and a common 
justice. It makes known the facts to the 
indl^vidual, the appropriations of its 
government. It pro^vides free and open 
news and discussion. Indeed it is so: 
-free it gives even the right to overthrow 
.its government at the ballot box and to 
change or alter its newspapers, or to 
•subvert them to other fields, and to dis­cuss anything, even Communism. •

By Thomas :'F;-Byrne' '28, President of the Alumni ^Association...-^ 
' (D^elivered at the Alumni-Barfqu'et)^'-; .Jl "^ %'^''.-, ',-;,' 
It comes as an anti-climax to all that, has happened in the world during the past three years to report in cold, sta­tistical language on the activities of your ' Alumni Association since the original-, ten-point program of your present'Board•' was published in August, 1943. The.a'd-,. ministration which has ensued since was' prolonged, as you know, by the wartime; emergency. 
Our difficulties as an association.dur­ing this period, while minor by compari-v son with some of the sacrifices which, many of our members were called upon to make, were nonetheless real. 
It is significant, we feel, that the im­
provements that remain to be made are 
to a large extent quantitative. The qual­
ity of our program has been proved. We 
need more than we have of many things, 
both spiritual and material, but the past 
three extraordinary years have proved 
that the nature of our objectives have 
not changed. 
Probably the best way to illustrate this and, at the same time, summarize for you the acts of your present admin­istration is to take up the original ten points and follow their pi-ogress since their original publication in Augrust, 1943. The first point, listed as an objective t)f all alumni was stated in these words: 
1. In service, or out, the day to day life of educated Christian gentlemen— which has already reflected great cred­it upon the University—should be more vital. 
The Alumni Association is proud of the military records of Notre Dame men in service—^from former Military Dele­gate Bishop John F. O'Hara, C. S. C, former President of the University and present Bishop of Buffalo—to the hurnbl­est G. I. Joe. They have been awarded many decorations and medals for hero­ism or gallantry in action—or for ex­traordinary achievement and devotion to duty. Their conduct and its reflected credit on Alma Mater is evident in the. long Honor Roll and in the many letters from all branches of the service testify­ing to those qualities of which Notre Dame is proud and for the inculcation of which she exists. 
The record of the men who were not 
in-service, small groups.'..reinaining".to:' carry.on:the influencedof>the-University '.aifd'^tKe' Clubs in the.'various cpnimuiii;' !.tjes; "is. reflected in the .pages; of'tiie<

 " . ' I. ' • . ^' 'Most definite, howeveiyaiid significant in itsicarrjing out of-this first point, has ;be.en-the establishmeiit-,ih the Club pro-. 'grani of the Gomrnittees:of Religion and-. 'Gilizenship. In view of;the evergrowing-• challenge' to Ghi-istiari ' d e m o c-r a c y .

Foi-tunately, \ye' iiow have the add-: : ed support of a great many' men back-from service, wliose experiences,hayenot' only given them a new appreciation of-. what their religion means in their'daily lives, but also a new awareness of the : strength of the attacks being made upon it. We have great hopes that as these Committees on Religion and Citizenship become more generally established and gain in experience, they will become rec­ognized in their communities: as eflfect­

VTliey'worlc of the Glubs in contacting ('their,'members in service—especially Dej^ -^.troiit,. Denver, New York, Philadelphia, .-•and other clubs with special periodical ^communications — is now well-known. Continuing the traditions of Universal Notre Dame Night, Universal Commu­; nion Sunday, and the special functions of particular Clubs, have been highlights of the history of these years. The outstand­ing success of the 1946 Universal Notre -"'Daine Night is a tribute in itself to the 
•.;weir presei-ved structure of the Clubs 
- ^during-the war years. The placement 
•program, carried on by the Clubs, not­withstanding greatly reduced member­ships _and-,oJ;lier handicaps brought on byth'ewar,:is another testimonial to the

The Club service letters have been mentioned and served a tremendously important purpose. As for the partici­pation by the families of alumni, the rec-cord has never been better. Club news in ; the ALUMNUS made frequent reference ; to the inclusion of the families in the..; Communion Breakfasts, Masses and Re-^ . treats as asked.

short of the Centenary Fund in amonnt, and in numbers of contributors, but 'was closed in a year and a half, as against the two-year period of the Centenary. The Third Annual Fund, in. 1945, fell again a little short of the first two, but held up 'in percenage of participation, and was reduced in time to the calendar year. To say that participation "heW up" in 1945 is a euphemistic way of saying that participation, over the past two years, seems to have leveled off at ap­proximately 30.6 per cent. On the face of the figures, the various Fnnds have so far been supported by approximately the same group of "old faithfuls" each year. For the good of the association and its plans for the future, this should be cor­rected before it becomes a fixed pattern. 
The Fourth Aniinal Fund, now in pro­gress, aims to establish the Fund program on a peacetime basis of substantial aid to our expanded postwar plans. Exx)enses have naturally increased with the in­crease in both the scope and intensity of the new program. But with a staff of eight employees fuU-time and one part-time; with the abnormal turnover of all records in the mailing department due to the entrance into and subsequent de­mobilization of some 10,000 Notre Dame men from the armed forces; with the ad­dition of the Fund promotion and Place­ment program in the Association's bud­get, together with more intensive liaison with the University and augmented pro­motion, the per capita cost of operation has not increased over the f 2 figfure

which prevailed in the years preceding the war. 
8. "Continued hiterest in the presence at Notre Dame of the best type of stu­dent from all over the United States to the limit of civilian capacity and'qual­ifications of the selective service." 
The continuation of the University's identity over and above the Navy pro­gram on the campus is a tribute to the fidelity of alumni in following through this program. And the tremendous- im­pact of the present period is eloquent if embarrassing testimony to the selling. power of the alumni. The results have proved this program of promotion one. which is natural to alumni organization and especially effective for us because o'f­the universal nature of Notre Dame's enrollment. Your Alumni Board is mak-­ing concerted efforts to obtain preference for that group which bears the most sig­nificant relationship to the loyalty of alumni in this phase of the organization —namely, the sons, brothers, nephews and more distant relations who fonn a large percentage of the applicants. 
9. "Continued interest in the placing of Notre Dame -men in the most advanta­geous jobs, with a special cotisideration 
•now for job-planning for the Notre Dame men in service when they re­tunu Clubs, especially, could set tip postwar placement committees now." 

With the possible exception of the Fund program, no phase of the subse­quent years' activity has brought more concrete advancement or popular support than this. The Vocational Committee, or­ganized under Bernard J. VoU, surveyed the N. D. men in service for their job needs, educational planning (which has been accurately borne out in recent trends), and suggestions generally. The response was so good and sound that the Alumni Office, under William R. Dooley's direction, enlisted the immediate sup­port of the Clubs and" 28 placement com-, mittees have been functioning for some time in all the leading, key Club areas in the important work of counseling re­turned N. D. service men in securing suitable jobs. Results so far indicate a very satisfactory achievement record. Plans are being made to reconvert these committees from emphasis on veterans' placement to the important normal-era role of general placement of both new and experienced alumni to the best ad­vantage. 
tO."Continued informing of yourself on the program, problems and needs of Notre Dame, and the pa^siiig along of this information to those oiitside the alumni who can be helpful to Notre Dame." 
TKi^gh'.tlfe-cooperation of the Uni-v;ersity,(tlie".Alumni Board has been dil­igentvinjpa'ssing along to the alumni, in­fonjiatioh.-as suggested in this final point-The Board has'also worked, closely with-;the; Department of Public Relations; .unyerj; Arthur Haley. The; recent s'ub­

Alumni'.Cooperated 
We believe the>fofegbing summaiy is 

•evidence that th'e- Board's program, as 
'set'forth three.-years ago, has been ad­he^d to and lias.'been successful, due in-large ineasure to. alumni cooperation. Only 'a large volume, .could detail the steps, the meetings, the'work and the cooperation of ail who contributed to realizing these objectives. 
The usual handicaps.of changing per­sonnel, rising-costs, shortages of mate­rials, uncertainties in coniiection with planning, ahead, existed throughout the perio"d.Many activities which were plan-ne'd were obviously not possible, bi- .were curtailed because.of the exigencies of the. times. 
J^. higHightiachievement of the period was the adopitiori of. the new - Constitu­tion to facilitate the Association's ex­panded program. .Apj.ropfiate by-^laws are now in preparati5n. 
Special attention is being g^ivien to campus relations, to the Local -A.luinni Cliibs, to identifying your Association as an articulate medium of trairi^i thought in national and international af­fairs. We just can't afford to sit back and try to place the responsibility to answer the attacks levelled at us from all sides on the clergy—its our responsi­bility to tear off the cunning masks of these subversive groups—and show their hideous thoughts in the full sunlight of truth. 
Your Association worked with-tlie Ath­letic Department in arriving'kt an eqtiit­able method of distributing football tick­ets for alumni—and the Board is work­ing: to serve the best interest of alumni in the problems of enrollment at Notre Dame. _ 
Our Alumni Secretary, James E. Arm­strong, and Assistant Alumni Secretary, William R. Dooley, have done a good job during these hectic years—^they will do a better job in the years ahead^as a re­sult of their open-minded attitude toward the many stimulating discussions at the 
Board Meetings these past three years. These last few years have riot been easy: years for any of us—and I can tell you 'confidently that your officers and Board will not be satisfied until the No­tre " -Dame Alumni Association stands head and shoulders over every group in tKe-.United States. You want it that way -^ybur officers and board want it that way-rK)ur alumni secretaries—Jim Arm­strong and Bill Dooley—^want it that way—;and the University of Notre Dame wantS'it that way! 
'I am pleased to inform you, that at the last Alumni Board meeting held in early June, the idea of an annual Alum­ni Award was approved unanimously. The details of the selection and the stan­dartls to be established will be worked out^ in cooperation with the University. I can say briefly that, as the Laetare Medal is sigrnificant to the Catholic laity of the United States, so, it is our earnest hope, the Notre Dame Alumni Awards will be sig^nificant to every one of us. 
:You have been informed numerous times of the whole-hearted support our distinguished President, the Very Rever­end J. Hugh O'Donnell, C. S. C., has giv­en us. The words of his address at Com­menceinent in 1943 express our gratitude most profoundly—"Our-hearts are full; we are truly grateful as we see about us so many evidences of God's continuing blessings upon the school dedicated to His Blessed Mother. Truly, in the words of Father Sorin, we have stood 'firm and unshaken, as one surrounded on all sides by the furious waves of a stormy sea, but who feels himself unmovable upon the moveless rock.'" That's how we feel about you. Father O'Donnell, because your leadership manifested at each Bdard minting:, has been most stimulat­ing—and we are grateful. 
Basically, the Association program may be said to have matured under the stress of war. The record proves that. But it also proves that there is ample op'portunity ahead for all of us to meas­ure up to great challenges. Let us not forget that we need more than we have of many things—^both spiritualand ma­terial—but that the greatest contribu­tion that any of us can make to the glory, of-Notre. Dame is to be intelligent­ly informed arid articulate in defense of the .Christian social principles which she taught uis and which are now under such yirulerit attack. If we can live up to our "Figrhting Irish" traditions in this re­gard we can with clear consciences ex­pect r.O.ur Lady of. the Golden Dome to continue to -lielp riiake siiccessful our Aluriini Association's "Spirit of Notre Dame." 
Medidevali Ihsi^^ 
Very Rev. Gerald ;B. iP'h^lan joi'Djfect: Only Program of Kind:in UnifeelcSfetes', 
Creation at Notre Dame of a Mediae­val Institute, the only one' of its kind in the United States, was announced by Rev. J. Hugh O'Donnell, C. S. C, presi­dent, early in July. 
The Director of the Mediaeval Insti­tute will be the Very Rev. Gerald B. Phelan, Ph.D., LL.D., F. R. S. C, who since 1937 has been president of the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, Toronto, Canada. 
In making: the announcement. Father O'Donnell said: "While developing the several fields of modem science and other fields of modem knowledge, No­tre Dame is keenly aware of the need of preserving, fostering and developing traditional Catholic learning in Theol­ogj'. Philosophy, History and the Hu­manities which are fundamental to all Catholic education. To this end, we are establishing the Mediaeval Institute, which, it is hoped, will center the full­est development of Catholic scholarship. \vithin the University. This is a nota-• ble part of Notre Dame's post-war aca­demic expansion." 
The Mediaeval Institute, Father O'­Donnell said, will be a distinct and in­dependent academic unit within the Uni-. versity. It will be primarily a research institution, devoted to an intensive study of the life and thought of the Middle Ages, the critical editions of unpublished materials, the publication of scholarly studies and critical analyses of available sources, the tracing of currents of thought and movements of civilization and, in general, whatever may advance our knowledge and understanding of Catholic mediaeval culture. 
At the outset, courses in mediaeval theology, philosophy, history, Latin, and English will be offered in the Institute, while research will be concentrated on theology, philosophy, history, and Eng­lish literature. Later mediaeval vema­cular literature, law, liturgy, art and architecture, Jewish and Arabian cul­ture, Byzantine civilization, and Mediae­val Music will be added to the curricu­lum, and the fields of research will be widened. 
Students admitted to the Mediaeval Institute must hold the bachelor's de­gree and have' done adequate college work in philosophy, English, Latin, his­tory, anil tH'e:mp'de?ndariguages,;French and German; The-fullVcoiuse. of:study, leading to a diploiim.''fromUfe';Institu^^^ will extend overfive^i'schopVyes^s-' With­in this period, the inastei^s 'dej^ee.may be received from-.tKe: Uniyersity'at .tHe end of two years, ah'd •th'e doctor's de­gree at the end bif fo'ur;,y'eare; • 
Dr. Phelan, directorfofJ;t1ve\new,Insti­tute, was co-director witfejEftif.-Etienne Gilson of the Institute-.vjofri-Miiljaieval Studies from 1931 to/l^.^i'-Hfe^ckme to the Univei-sity ofiTqrwittfjin-1928 as professor of philosophy;" • 
After completing the regular studies for the priestHioqdian'd being-ordained in 1914, DhPftelan spent the next 11 years in a'dyanced theological and phil­osophical works, culminating with the degre'es of doctor of philosophy (1924) an'd'Agrege en philosophie (1925) from the University of Louvain, Belgium. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Can­ada and a corresponding fellow of the Mediaeval Academy of America. 
Dr. Phelan is the author of a number of Hooks, the latest of which, Some Il­lustrations of St. Thomas' Development of the Wisdom of SK Augustine, has appeared this year. He also has con­tributed numerous articles to philoso­phical journals. 
Within the past 20 years there has been remarkable revival of the study of the Middle Ages in the United States. The founding of the Mediaeval Academy of America in 1926 was one of the first fruits of this renaissance as well as a source of continuing study. In 1936 Notre Dame began its Publications in Mediaeval Studies, a learned series un­der the editorship of the Rev. Dr. Phil­ip S. Moore, C. S. C, dean of the Grad­uate School. 
Now, with the establishing of the Med­iaeval Institute, the University is giving new impetus to the scholarly investiga­tion of one of the richest periods in the history of 'Western thought and culture. 
BOOKS GIVEN BY MRS. STANFORD 
Mrs. Grattan T. Stanford, widow of the late Grattan T. Stanford, '04, form­er lay trustee, has made to the Univers­ity a gift of Mr. Stanford's collection of 70 volumes of Corpus Juris. The books will be placed in a special section of the Law library with a suitable conunem­oration of Mr. Stanford, who, at the time of his death in April was general counsel for the Sinclair Oil Co. in New York. 
Creation of a National Commission on Veterans' Afkdis to coordinote Telerons' activities in Catholic colleges was a highlight oi the annual meeting ol the Notioinal Federation of Catholic college students held at Regis College, Weston. Mass. in June. Thomas I. McCaffrey. Vallejo. Colii. a Notre Dame student-Teteran. was elected chairman of the new commission and its headquarters wiU be at Notre Dame.

AT LAST—MABBIAGE PBEPABAnON COURSE 
Many grads have written recently asking for books on marriage. In the past, we've been aware that any- book or books recommended treated only cer-^ tain aspects of marriage. 
Now at last we can proclaim the ideal publication — a marriage preparation course, which treats all phases of mar­riage, the. spiritual, the social and eco­nomic, even the physical. 
It's not a book, but a correspondence course. Thorough and complete. lectures, given by priests, sociologists, psychia-' tnsts and doctors to young: engaged couples; — ha-ve been edited "and; pre­pared for a correspondence course of some 15 lessons. 
They discuss. not only the spiritual and sacramental phase but the physco­logical. (also how to keep your wife happy!); the economic, budgets and in­surance; and even the physical. The laist few lessons on the physiology of marriage can be secured only by those already engaged or married and so certified or approved by-a pastor. 
The cost is $5.00 and the'address is Marriage' Preparation' Service, The Catholic Centre, University, of Ottawa, 125 'Wilbrod St., Ottawa, Ontario, Can­ada. 
The charge is $5.00 but it is worth it. it is worth a lot more if it can—as it -will—aid in avoiding; so many: of the tragic crashes in marriage today. 
Excellent not only for thpse engaged but for the young married couple. 
To Father John Cavanaugh and his staff, congratulations—and assurances of prayers and confidence that you'll lead Notre' Dame to greater heights. 
To Father J. Hugh O'Donnell, grati­tude for successfully conducting Notre Dame throtigh perilous times—and as­
surances of prayers  for  your  even  great­ 
er  service  to  God,  country  and  Notre  
Dame.  

GOD. LOVE YOU « 
In the midst of strikes, food and hous­ing- shortages, fear, chaos and misery, it's 
reassuring to re­
member a few fundamentals. 
God lovrs each of you so much that He created you for heav­en's overwhelm­ing happiness. 
God loves each of you so much that He died for 
Father Lynch 
you. 
God loves each of you so much that He lives on down here on earth; in you in the state of grace, in the Eucharist as your spiritual nourishment and as a pledge of your resurrection. 
God loves each of you so much that He gave His mother to be your mother. 
God loves each of you so much that He wants you back, passionately wants you back with Him in heaven. 
YOU CANT TAKE IT WITH YOU 
We attended a funeral recently. Dur­ing the eulogy which stressed the man's worldly achievements, we strayed and chewed over this thought. 
At death, you take with you only those things that you have given away. 
You leave the things you have am2.ss­ed—^money, fame, power and possessions. 
You're stripped of all those things, completely and starkly stripped. 
You go before God clothed exclusively with those things you gave away: time, fidelity, devotion and money given to God or to others — ycur family and neighbor — for love of God. 
You can console yourself with that when you shell out to the wife or the kids — or to church. 
Incidentally, in our travels, meeting various pastors, we're proudest when a pastor cites some N.D. graduate in his parish as a helper: not merely as a contributor but as a worker. 
Your parish is the center of your Catholic life and the pastor needs your help. 
Volunteer — and any time you thus give away to God, thatjs what you'll be taking with you at death. 
CONGRATULATIONS; IffiW YORK 
The New York Club did a great job in pro\'iding for us the excellent speech by Congresswoman Claire Booth Luce, at its Universal Notre Dame Night dinner. Re­printed in the June ALUMNUS and the Congressional Record (May 6, 1946), that speech should be clipped for our files, re-i-ead, meditated, and loaned to friends of any, and of no, religion. 
Also meritorious is the New York Club's participation in the Youth Coun­seling Service of the Archdiocese of New York. The Counseling Ser-.-ice aims to provide Big Brothers to befriend and guide youths who are delinquent or vic­tims of broken arid disrupted homesl 
New York isn't the .first in the field (I know PKila'del'phia made a start in 1D44) arid-may itriot be the last. 
The time s^ent will bring God's bless­ing on your own- family and kids—and any time you give away in this work, that's one of the .things- you'll be taking with you at death. 
FEATHEB:BBAINS 
A recent issue of .Kme magazine re­
•viewed very favorably a book on St. Philip Neri. A, jojrbus saint he was and given somewhat to humorous but effec­tive penances in confession. 
We recall one such-incident in his life. A woman confessed-telling a tale about her neighbor. She was sorry, she said, and wanted to repair the damage. As a penance, Philip told her to rip open a pillow, scatter the feathers to the -wind, then come back in one -week. 
On her return, she recited compliance and asked "What next?"

Record Enrollment in Septeniber 
Lt. John Gregory Kelly, '38, Chicago, missing in the Pacific for more than a year, has been officially listed by the War Department as presumed dead. Greg was bombardier, observer and gunnery ofiicer aboard "The Life of Riley," a B-29 based on Tinian. He is survived by his wife and two daughters. 
On a mission over Nagoya, Japan— Greg's eighth—^the base received a ra­dio report that one engine was afire, and fifteen minutes later another plane reported that the ship was preparing for a crash landing. 
Greg worked in advertising in Chicago after graduation and entered the army in January, 1942. He trained at Midland Field, Texas, Brooksville Air Base, Fla., and Fairmont Army Air Base, Nebr., before leaving for overseas on Christmas day, 1944. He was credited with the prob­able destruction of a Jap fighter. 
Lt. Philip E. Harbert, '43, of Park Ridge, 111., formerly declared missing in action, has now been presumed dead, according to notice received recently from the War Department. 
Phil was a fighter pilot with the 506th Fighter Squadi-on of the 9th Air Force. At the time of his death on Jan 25, 1945, he was engaged in a fighter sweep near Bonn, Germany, in preparation for the Allied crossing of the Rhine. His plane sustained battle "damage and was seen by one "of his squadron mates to crash. 
He is survived by his parents, his fath­er being George E. Harbert, '18. He was the cousin of Most Rev. John F. O'Hara, Bishop of 'BuflFalo, and former presi­dent of Notre'Dame. 
Sgt. DUer J. O'Connor, Jr., '44, of DeKalb, 111., was killed in France on Janl 5, 1945, according to word received recently in the Alumni Oflice. 
Diser lefit Notre Dame early in 1941. He was .manning his machine-gun " i high ; ground north of Reipertauille, : France, when a German bazooka shell 
killed him instantly. 
GjFT FROM THE WAGNERS 

John P. and • Mazie Wagner of Mil­waukee made a "gift of ?ipiOl[)0 to No­tre Daihe's'Laboratories of Bacteriology in Jiine. The gift is for the purpose of covering .certain research work in the Laboratories. Mr. Wagner was a student at' Notre Dame in 1910-11. 
About 4,200 to be Admitted: All Facilities Strained to Aid. 
In the semester starting on Sept. 12, the University \nll admit the largest number of students in its history, about 4,200, as compared with the prewar nor­mal of 3,000 to 3,200. Approximately two-thirds of the new enrollment will be war veterans. The previous registration record, 3,502, was established in the se­mester which closed on June 30, 1946, 
In an all-out attempt to accommodate, out of the thousands upon thousands of applications received, the maximum ' number of, students, the University is straining every facility, as to faculty, classroom space,: laboratory space and housing. Campus residence rooms have been "doubled up" and additional quart­ers are being sought'in South Bend. 
Farley Hall, now under constraction, will provide considerable extra space, as will 117 temporary apartment units be­ing erected by the Federal Public Hous­ing Authority to the east of the campus, for the use of married-veterans and their families. While the major cost of the latter is borne by the federal gov­ernment, the University is contributing from $85,000 to $40,000 for installation of water mains, sewers and roads. These expenses are not recoverable in rents. 
The barracks-tyi)e buildings, brought to the University from a prisoner of war camp at Weingarten, Mo., provide apartments having living room, two bed­rooms, kitchen and bath.

LIFE OF FATHER ZAHM 

Running modestly through the issues of The Ave Maria from January 5 to July 20, 1946, has been an admirable biography of the late Rev. John A. Zahm, C. S. C, one of the great priest-scientists of America, who has left many marks of his talents on the record of progress of the Congegation of Holy Cross and the University of Notre Dame. 
Rev. Patrick J. Carroll, C. S. C, ed­itor of The Ave'Maria, is the author of this historical work. He undertook it some years ago at the. request of the late Rev. James A. Bums, G. S. C, a friend and successor to Father Zahm. Also helpful to Father Carroll, in his preface he acknowledges, have been other figures long familiar to alumni. Dr. Albert F. Zahm, famous alumnus and aeronautical scientist, a brother of Father Zahm; Most Rev. John F. O'Hara, C. S. C ; Rev. Eugene P. Burke, 
C. S. C.; collaborators in sorting and translating, Revs. Philip Moore, William Robinson and Charles Doremus; and' librarians Paul R. Byrne and Marie Law­rence. 
BULLETIN 

Capt. Anthony L. Danis, USN, on Aug. 5 succeeded Capt. J. Richard Barry, USN, as professor of naval science and tactics and as commanding officer of the University's peacetime NROTC unit of 296 men. Captain Barry is retiring from the Navy after 37 years of active serv­ice. Captain Danis, graduated from the Naval Academy in 1922, received the Navy Cross for "extraordinary heroism." 
ALUMNI OFFICER LEAVES 

Rev. Francis P. Gopdall, C.S.C., '20, first director of alumni relations,' and first undergraduate placement counselor, has left these posts to fill the vice-presi­dency of the University of Portland. 
The Alumni Association and' the Uni­versity had enjoyed mutual ; benefits from the 'valuable pioneering in the new offices done by Father GoodalL Holder of both engineering; and arts degrees, he brought to the work the thorough­ness of method of the engineer and the . imaginative stimulus of the liberal arts thinker. 
He filled both posts assigned to him -with very tangible evidence of progress marking his regime. At the same time he was a guiding genius in the renaissance of the Notre Dame Coundi, E. of C, of which he had been student grand knight. And he had fostered the revival of the Notre Dame Club of Toledo and the student Toledo - Club of Notre Dame^ representing associations with his home town. 
He had many friends and made many more among the Alumni Clubs and the individual alimini with whom he worked. He had made a definite impression on students and industrial contacts in the development of that valuable phase of counseling on the campus. 
Father Goodall -will be missed personr ^ ally and (^dally, but he has left a pat­tern for his successor—not yet named-— which promises to continue the 'valuable contributions to both alumni and stu­dents which can be made.by a priest in these offices. . 
The Notre Dame Alumnus 
THE COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS 
(Continued from page 8) document in history does, the dignity and authority of the indi%'idual man. The low­liest of him stands a majestic witness to the law of life that no man-made rule can thwart the freedom of his will and choice. 
America's greatness is due to that— 
and to that alone. Other countries have 
larger populations and more manpower. 
Other nations possess richer natural re­
sources. Other nations have lived longer 
in the same area with more prolonged 
opportunities for development. Countries 
like China, Russia, Persia, Turkey, In­
dia, Egypt were great states before this 
continent was discovered. 
But here was achieved by free men, living in the dignity of the inalienable rights of man, the highest standard of material living ever known to man in an atmosphere of the largest measure of hu­man liberty ever the estate of man. 
Cost Is High 
This gain in civilization must not be lost. It must not be lost by default. It must not he lost because our very wealth weakens our spirit so that we lack the vigilance to defend our liberties, to fight eternally against those who would des­troy our particular civilization based on religion and law and who would reduce us to a slavery to the State's whim and caprice. If to achieve a state-guaranteed security, it is necessary to accept the to­tal authority of the State over our spir­its and lives, then the cost is too high and the security is worthless. 
As Benjamin Franklin so aptly and wisely said it at the beginning of our na­tional history: "They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little .tem7, porary safety deserve neither libertyinbr' safety." ' " ; 
The keenest vigilance, the strongest safeguards will not protect us.unless we recognize automatically and promptly the principles that have establish'e'd/our na­tion, principles that are eternal.and un­changeable, that come to us-from God's bounty and which we desert-at/qur peril. Those principles may be stated vsimply: that civilization is for man; that man po­ssesses the dignity of his own/personality because he was created in the, image of God who showers His love'/,upon him; that the rights of man-aref Jhalienable, even the most formidable State trans­gressing moral law at itsjultimate peril; that man is a creature of God's love and therefore may never hate—neither friend nor foe, neither the weak'; nor-the strong; neither kin nor stranger. Man's hatred must not be against mah'/but against falsehood, against pferyereioins and dis­tortions of truth, against injustice. 
And as I speak these- words to you, you must recognize the picture of our own country—a natio'n that has just fought a costly aiid devastating war but has seized no territory; that has con­quered countries'but not peoples; that is today feeding- its enemies of a year ago; that is'reconstructing and rebuild­ing the very, landsof its former enemies who have killed';its sons. 
I am.prouder'to be a citizen of a coun­try. th'at''can^giye generously and without r^eiwation-.tiian I would be of a state that gains ;st're"ngth by enslaving human beings and'seizing the remains of their broken cities as'the booty of war. I am proud to be a citizen of a country that ends a fight without hatred, and that loves little children • and seeks to feed them wthout asking the babe suckling at its mother's breast what is its politics. 
-A.nd so I speak to you today, to many ; of you, who have just returned from war, from the sacrifice of your young , years in this clash of ci'vilizations. I speak to you in this manner because I seek to enlist you in an eternal, an ever­lasting war. I ask for your young cour­age. I turn to the idealism of your;' Springtime. 
Our heritage is so rich in human val-^-. 
ues that we must be everlastingly coura­geous for their preservation. No' people, no race may justly claim a monopoly of contribution to the treasure of wisdom that has been handed down to us. Pales­estine, Greece and Rome, in the early years of human history, lighted the way for a ci-vilization of which we are all .'the guardians, not only for ourselves, but ^for posterity; not only for our country, 
but for all the world. 
UniTersal Heritage 
In this spirit of the unity of our heri­tage and in the unity of our purposes, may I say a word as the son of an an­cient people for whom you and I have received so goodly a portion of the rich treasure of God's word which we share affectionately and reverently. My people have for thousands of years been scoffed at by unfriendly nations of men because they refused to part with their heritage. And even when the fleshpots of power and the comforts of material riches and the hope for a man-made security so turned them from God that they lost their bearings and forgot even for a mo­ment the direction of their faith, a Jer­emiah could weep, "All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not." 
Yet after every period of licking at the paws of a Golden Calf, my people have turned their backs upon the e-vils of the world and facing again toward the Zion of their ideals, heard the word of God and listened to it in comfort and faith. 
This heritage from Israel is yours, as it is mine, for as Pope Pius XI said, "Spiritually, we are all Semites." This heritage has come to us from twelve lowly Jews, fishermen, carpenters, and such who gave the world their witnessing of those events in Palestine nearly two thousand years ago that are epitomized in your religion and in your way of life. This heritage you and I share and from it we gain the strength to fight, with the courage you showed in war, the -vicious materialism that would reduce our world to a State-controlled savagery. 
Courage and Faith 
Be courageous as you bring what you have learned here with you in your pro­fessions, your business, your politics. Be courageous as you apply the Golden Rule and the Sermon on the Mount to your everyday life. Be courageous as you fight every influence in this world, and par­ticularly in this country, that would re­duce religion to an opiate for the people instead of a guide for the enlighten­ment of man and the dignifying of his personality. Be courageous and battle for the liberty of man and the freedom of your country. Battle slavery whether to man or State; battle falsehood even if you stand alone, a single indi-vidual against the seemingly overwhelming tides of popularity. 
You have received an education and guidance in the atmosphere and -within the traditions of a great heritage. You live not only for the moment but on the beam of thousands of years of human grrowth. The humanities are eternal as Truth is eternal. A school such as this cannot train a man only for his daily woirk, for his momentary means of earn­ing a living. It broadens him; it mellows his spirit; it associates him with all that came before. It provides him -with pre­cepts for living that are not only to be read and slightly remembered, but which, if applied every day to the art of li-ving, make of him a good and a wise man, an upright citizen, a pillar of our free insti­tutions, a courageous fighter for prin­ciple and against falsehood. 
In this spirit and with God's blessing, I bid you go forth, men of courage and faith, to do God's work in every walk of life, to jnaintain a ci-vilization of the rights of man whose beneficiaries you are, to leave untarnished your heritage to your children, to seek justice, to love mercy, that man everywhere shall enjoy the freedom that is yours, the goodness of life that is God's gift to. you.

ATHLETICS 
Athletic units representing the Uni­versity of Notre Dame compiled an envi­able record of 26 victories, 14 defeats and one tie during the 1946 Spring sports season. 
GOLF 
The Irish golf team, coached by Rev. George L. Holderith, C. S. C., paced Irish teams with a brilliant season record of 7 wins, one loss and one tie in nine matches. Father Holderith's linksmen won over Purdue, Michigan, Marquette, Ohio Northern, Michigan State, Wayne and Detroit. They tied Wisconsin and lost their only match of the campaign to Northwestern, 14 to 13. Dick Whit­ing, No. 1 Irish golfer from Detroit, Mich., celebrating his first regular season With the Notre Dame team after return­ing from service, won the Indiana Col­lege individual championship and placed fourth in NCAA competition. The Irish finished sixth in NCAA team standings. 
BASEBALL 
Coach Jake Kline's Notre Dame base­ball team turned in the best season en­joyed by an Irish nine in the past decade when the Blue and Gold baseballers won 13 and lost only 6. Kline's 1946 team developed into one of the best hitting aggregations in the history of the sport at the University. The Irish were at bat 712 times and pounded out 202 safe hits for a team batting average of .284. Afield, they handled a total of 827 chances with only 44 errors for a per­centage of .947. Jack Mayo, left fielder from Youngstown, O., paced the Irish with 34 hits in 80 trips to the plate for an average of .425. Following closely on Mayo's heels was rightfielder Elmer Raba of Washington, D.C., with 22 hits in 58 times at bat for an average of .379. 
TENNIS 
Capt. Bill Tully, of Bronxville, N. Y., and George Ratterman, of Cincinnati, paced the Notre Dame tennis team to six victories and only three defeats dur­ing the 1946 season. The Irish netters triumphed over Indiana, Purdue, Michi­gan State, Western Michigan, Wisconsin and Marquette, while losing to Navy, Michigan and Northwestern. Tully and Ratterman, both Naval ROTC trainees, garnered their share of points for the Irish, but team balance proved decisive for the Middies, Wolverines and Wild­cats when they registered victories over Coach Walter Langford's netters. 
TRACK 
Lack of power in the field events proved costly for the Notre Dame track and field aggregation throughout the outdoor season, and the Irish failed to cop a single decision in dual meet com­petition. Coach Elvin R. (Doc) Handy's tracksters dropped a 69 2/3 to 521/3 meet to Wisconsin, were drubbed by Michigan to the tune of 74% to 47% in their only home meet, lost to Michigan State, 78 to 44 and bowed to Mar­quette, 66 to 65. Only consistent point winners for Notre Dame during the out­door campaign were miler Bill Leonard, of Schenectady, N. Y., who faded toward the end of the season, and Madill (Bud) Gartiser, of Webster Groves, Mo., in the hui-dles. Gartiser finished fourth in the 220-yard low hurdles in the NCAA meet. Notre Dame finished third behind Indi­ana and Purdue in the state meet and tied for sixth spot in the annual Central Collegiate Conference meet. 
FOOTBALL 
Head Football Coach and Director of Athletics Frank W. Leahy will call mem­bers of the 1946 Notre Dame football squad together for the first Fall work­out on Cartier Field, Aug. 21, to begin preparation for the season opener against Illinois on Sept. 28. 
Although Coach Leahy expects to have a much improved ball club over most war-time aggregations, it is not antici­pated on the campus that this is the year to beat Army. In fact, the game the Irish are pointing for at present is the opener against a highly-touted Illini eleven which will feature^ .k; backfield highlighted by Buddy Young, Julius Ry­kovich and Paul Patterson of"'pre-war days. '• '. 
Jack Zilly, Southingtoh, Conn?, 1943 monogram winner, probably will^be the only really experienced end;-reporting for the 1946 squad. Frank:Kosik'owski, Milwaukee, transfer student from Mar­quette University, had experience play­ing with the Fleet City. Navy team. Three freshman possibilities" are: Jim Martin, Cleveland, who won-'the spring practice medal for the -best blocking end; Dave Lloyd, Los Angeles, and Bob Walsh, Chicago. ; •. 

At the tackles. Bob McBride, Logan, O., prisoner of the Germans for 122 days, monogram winner at guard in 1942, has been shifted to left tackle because of a shortage of tackles. He was bothered with leg trouble during spring practice. Zygmont "Ziggie" Czarobski, Chicago, regular on the national championship team of 1943, is back from' the Navy and undoubtedly will see plenty of action at right tackle. George Connor, also from Chicago, who announced his transfer from Holy Cross in order to be nearer his father who is seriously ill, also is expected to strengthen the Irish at tackles. Bill Fischer, another Chicagoan, and Jack Fallon, Alton, HI., are sophomore pros­pects back from the 1945 eleven. 
John Mastrangelo, Vandergrift, Pa., right guard, who was named to' most All-America teams last season, probably will be the No. 1 Notre Dame guard candidate this year. Mastrangelo was named "Lineman of the Week" by the Associated Press last year following the 6-6 tie game with Navy. Fred Rovai,. of Hammond, Ind., will be seeking his second starting position with the 1946 eleven. Tom Potter, Kearney, N. J., and Vince Scott, LeRoy, N. Y., won monograms as reserves a year ago. George Tobin, Ariington, Mass., and Luke Higgins, Edgewater, N. J., who were substitutes in 1942, are back to bolster the line. 
The center post is a definite question mark. George Strohmeyer, McAIlen, Tex., picked up experience with the Iowa Seahawks in service ball, and Bill Walsh, Phillipsburgh, N. J., an 18-year old, was the starting center on the 1945 club. Bill Vangen, Bell, Calif., a fresh­man possibility in 1941, has returned from 52 months of submarine service and is having a difficult time getting his legs in shape. Marty Wendell, of Chi­cago, HI., who was transferred by the Navy from Notre Dame to Great Lakes before the opening of the 1945 season, has enrolled at Notre Dame for the Fall semester and should add considerable line-backing ability to the Irish squad. 
Johnny Lujack, Connellsville, Pa., who took the place of Angelo Bertelli at quarterback for the Irish midwa y through the 1943 campaign, has been discharged from the Navy and returns to Notre Dame as a junior. Coach Leahy rates him with any college 
The Notre Dame Alumnus 
quarterback in the countrj-. Frank Tri­pucka, Bloomfield, N. J., showed good adaptability to the T-Formation at quax-terback in the spring workouts, but he is only 18 and lacks experience. George Ratterman will likewise be in the quarterback position and liis pass­ing ability should continue to provide plenty of woriy for the opposition. 

There are three lettermen available at left half, but no breakaway runners. Bob Livingstone, Hammond, Ind., looked like a comer in winning a monogram in 1942, but returns from a long stretch in the infantiy and is ha,-\'ing foot trouble. Teriy Brennan, Milwaukee, won a monogram in 1945, as did Johnny Agnone, Youngstown, 0., although neither boy is very big. Bud Gartiser, track man, is the speediest lad on the squad. Emil (Red) Sitko, Ft. Wayne, Ind., a freshman here in 1942, who later played well for Great Lakes, should be a great help. 
There are also three monogi-am re­turnees at right half, but here too the picture is brighter on paper than in actualitj'. Bob Kelly, Chicago, 1944 regular, is back from Annapolis, but missed more than half of Spring pi^ac­tice because of a bad leg, having one charley-horse after another. Emil Slo­vak, EUiston, O., has as much drive as any man on the squad, but tips the scales at a mere 150. Bill Gompers, Wheeling, W. Va., who along with Slo­vak lettered in 1945, is IS and needs experience. Floyd Simmons, Portland, Ore., and Mike Swistowicz, Chicago, are good freshman prospects. 
Jim Mello, Wanvick, R. I., 1943 regu­lar, and Geriy Cowhig, Boston, 1942 monogram winner, are back from the Navy and -Axmy respectively at fullback. These two plus John Panelli, Morristown, N J., and Jim McGurk, Montclair, N. J., give experience and the likelihood of power at fullback. 
ONLY TRUE AMERICANS 
(Continued from page 12) 

They were quietly put away in jail or deported to countries more in sympathy 
•with their isms. 
Can it be that histoi-y is repeating it­self as we face the problem of handling the followers of Red Fascism in this, the twentieth century? Every member of the Communist party is a potential enemy of the United States. Individually and collectively they are out to overthrow our fonn of government and abolish our American way of life. Are we going to sit idly by and let them do it? Is this strong nation of ours so lethargic as to permit these ideological termites to des­troy it? I don't think so. 
Now, how does this third step in the plan of action apply to you as Notre Dame men? In the light of our twin loy­alties to God and countiy are we not challenged? Do you know of any group that should be more conscious of the ob­ligation to accept the challenge? 
If I may use the popular phrase, as alumni, "you have what it takes." For example, because of your grasp of the principles of fundamental morality, you can fully realize the insidious nature of Communism. Secondly, you can be articu­late. Thirdly, in the Committee on Re­ligion and Citizenship, which is a part of every Notre Dame club, you have an excellent channel of expression. 

Having respect for the law, you will proceed legally. If need be, ask Congress for legislation that will bring to the bar of justice every enemy from within who would first weaken and then destroy the American heritage. And speaking of Congress—^j'ou know as well as I do that the Communists are not at all backward in making their minds known to the na­tional legislature. They are not only vo­cal, but vociferous. Why not tell Con­gress the mind of America as well—^the mind of the vast majority who have kept and who want to keep the faith of our founding fathers? Let Congress know that we are aware of the Communist menace, that we are aware of its infiltra­tion into every phase of the national life, and that we don't like it. What we want is action, but action that is swift and ef­fective. We deported the Mafia, we de­ported the Syndicalists, so why not de­port these Red Fascists and send them back to their land of dreams, blood purges an d Siberian concentration camps! If you think this action too dras­tic, then proceed to read Kravchenko's, "I Chose Freedom," and William Bullit's, "The Great Globe Itself"—tivo books that should readily convince you that the time for pussy-footing has passed. 
Patriotism Traditional 

I have spoken to you as I have because I feel I would be derelict in my duty if I did not enlist the aid of all Notre Dame men on the fight against a heresy so in­imical to all we ti'easure as Americans and as.sons of Alma Mater. In appealing to you I have been mindful of one of the first acts of our founder. Father Sorin, when he landed in New York, where he knelt and kissed the soil of the land of his adoption. I have been mindful too of our century-old tradition of patriotism which began then, and which has since become one of our proudest glories—in the Civil War," in World War I, and in World War II. The tradition which call­ed us to arms against our enemies from without now summons us to fight the en­emy from within. And we shall not fail. 
"We Are Unafraid" 

As I said a few moments ago, our country has known critical periods in the past. I mentioned Washington at Valley Forge when the outlook for the struggl­ing colonies was darkest. Washington's men were without food, without clothes, without blankets to protect them from the bitter cold; they were without shoes, so that their marches might be traced by blood from their feet. But Washing­ton and his little band stood fast. Their common suffering in the face of a com­mon enemy knit them into a compact group as nothing else could have. And it was during these bleak days of Val­ley Forge, when Washington, making his bivouac secure, and knowing the temper of his men, spoke the stirring words, "Only tme Americans on guard tonight." 
Let Washington's words be our rally­ing cry: "Only true Americans on guard tonight"—^tonight and all the nights to come, on guard against the forces of Communism—^the forces of materialism and anti-God—that would rob Americans of their priceless legacy of freedom. For as long as tnie Americans remain on guard that legacy is safe—safe for us and for generations yet unborn. 
AVhat though we have just emerged from the storm clouds of a global war! What though the trials and difficulties of materialism and secularism beset us! "What though," in the words of the Victory March, "the odds be great or small," we are unafraid. We accept any challenge that error hurls against Truth. And as we observe this—our first peace­time commencement—^^ve renew our pledge of loyalty to the Mother of God in those memorable words of Father Sor­in as he viewed in retrospect his noble consecration to her on the snow-swept shores of St. Mary's lake more than one hundred years ago: "From that mo­ment, I remember not a single instance of a serious doubt in my mind as to the final result of our exertions, unless, by our unfaithfulness, we should change God's mercy into anger; and upon this consecration, which I felt was accepted, I have rested ever since, finn and un­shaken, as one surrounded on all sides by the furious waves of a stormy sea, but who feels himself planted immov­ably upon the moveless rock." 
S
POTLIGHT ALUMNI 
Robert (Buck) Halperin, '33, Chica­go, in July was awarded the Silver Star and the Bi-onze Star by the Navy. These awards formed a climax to the World War II career of a Notre Dame man who entered the Navy as an enlisted 
Buck Halperin 

man in March, 1942, and was relieved from active duty as lieutenant command­er early this year. In addition to these medals. Buck has the Na\'y Cross, the highest Navy award; the Chinese Na­tional Government medal Yun Hui (Cloud Banner), the highest Chinese rec­ognition; and the European-African-Middle Eastern Area campaign medal, the Asiatic-Pacific Area campaign med­al, and the World War II Victory medal. 
Buck was one of the original mem­bers of the Navj' Scouts and Eaiders, an organization, select in personnel, which was top-secret within top-secret. It was the task of this small band of men to pinpoint the invasions of North Africa, Italy, Sicily and Noi-mandy. Their H-hour was minus 4; when the landing crafts started their runs, the Scouts were already ashore, flashing ex­act visual identification of landmax-ks to the oncoming assault troops. Buck is credited with being the fii-st Ameri­can on the shore of North Africa on Nov. 8, 1942. 
Subsequent invasions found the Scouts always preceding the assault waves', but after the invasion of Fi-ance, it was rec­ognized that their work in Europe was about finished. Buck was recalled to Washington and furnished with his next assignment, Saco (Sino-American Co­opei-ative Organization). Within the month he was flown into Kanehow, Chi­na, just two days before Japanese troops captured the town. But Buck was already on his way to south Fukien Pi-ovince, near Amoy. There he was put in charge of Saco Unit No. 6, with nine officers, 3-5 navy enlisted men and 3,000 Chinese guerrillas under him. It was the Ameri­cans' job to train the Chinese in the use of demolitions, machine guns and lighter weapons, and incidentally to furnish all information of value to Allied forces. 
One incident in the varied progi^am of Saco which was publicized by the Navy was the work of Unit No. 6. It was the destniction of a 1,000-ton Japanese freighter and the killing or injuring of all personnel aboard in Amoy harbor. 
When the gai'risons at Amoy made their belated surrender last fall Buck was on hand to receive the swords of little Admiral Halata and his staff. 
It's no wonder that one alumnus writes about Buck: "He's my top candidate as the Notre Dame hero of World War II." 
REVIEW OF POLITICS 

Alumni interested in world affairs, and in the "philosophical and historical approaches to political i-ealities" in America and abroad, will find a constant scholarly and interesting treatment in the pages of the Revieiv of Politics, the quarterly published by the Univer­sity of Notre Dame under the editor­ship of Prof. Waldemar Gurian, assisted by a staff and board selected from the faculty and the Congregation of Holy Cross. ($2.50 a year.) 
The July issue features an excellent ai-ticle on the formal study of intei-­national relations by Prof. Gurian. 
"The Constitutional Theories of Thomas Paine," "The Road to Indian Autonomy," "Ukraine—Between Poland and Russia," "Germany Today," and "The Economics of Potsdam," which complete the July table of contents give an idea of the scope of the "Review." Also regularly featured ai-e excellent reviews of current books in the field. 
The "Review" is one of the outstand­ing cultural and educational contribu­tions which the University offers to the alumnus who has an interest in the political developments of our era. 
WAR PHOTOS SHOWN AT N. D. 

An exhibit of one pi; the most famoas collections of war photographs in the world, photographed By; a former Notre Dame student who has,.achieved inter­national acclaim as photographer, was visited by more thaii ;20,000 people during a special exhibit at Notre Dame from June 17 to June 30; •; 
The exhibit, one of the'most popular ever on display at Notre Dame, belongs to W. Eugene Smith, formerly of Wichita, Kan., but now of New York City. Gene entered Notre Dame in 1935 but left after a year to study pho­tography. During World War II he spent many months in the Pacific Theater, first as a war photographer for the Ziff-Davis Company of Chicago, and later as 2. member of the photographic staff of Life Magazine. 
To get his action pictures of jVmerican forces in the Pacific,, Gene risked his life on numerous occasions. One of those times, while photographing on Okinawa a story titled "24 Hours With Infantryman Terry Moore," which ap­peared in Life Magazine, he was badly wounded in the face and left hand by a Japanese mortar shell. 
Among the historic actions that he photographed were Rabaul, Truk, (first raid), Tarawa, Marshall Islands, Wake Island, Saipan, Guam, Leyte, the first raids on 'I'okyo, D-Day at Iwo Jima and D-Day at Okinawa. 
N. D. WINS COMMENDATION 

A special commendation for the part played by the University in the Navy V-12 program during World War II has been received from the U. S. Navy De­partment. 
The commendation, signed by Secre­tary of the Navy James Forrestal, reads: "This mark of commendation is awarded by the Navy Department to the Univer­sity of Notre Dame for effective coopera­tion with the United States Navy in the training of officer candidates under the Navy V-12 program during World War II." 
During the tenure of the naval train­ing station at Notre Dame, which grad­uated its last class of ROTC trainees at Notre Dame's 101st Commencement on June 30, more than 2,200 participated in the V-12 program. More than 12,200 men attended the Navy midshipman school at Notre Dame and 9,099 were commis­sioned in the Naval Reserve, 290 in the Marines. 
The commendation was presented to the Rev. J. Hugh O'Donnell, C. S. C, President of Notre Dame, by Vice--\dnur­al George D. Carpenter, U. S. N., com­mandant of the Ninth Naval District.

ALUMNI CLUBS 
Detroit 
The Notre Dame Club of Detroit staged a big blowout in the Sky Club of the Fort Shelby Hotel on- July 2. Tom Kavunaeh and Lloyd Bamin were co-chairmen of the jiffair. Close to 100 members attended, in addition to several from the Detroit campus club. 
The Xyala, a l2-nietcr boat owned by Bt>b Schlefnan of South Bend, won the annual Port Huron-Mackinac race with a record-breaking run in mid-July. Detroit Club members made up half the crew and included Bob and Art Cronin, John Annas, and Jack Zimmers. 
Although the list is incomplete, over 20 members of the Detroit Club attended the Alumni Reunion on the campus in June. All judged it a success and were impressed with the reports and speeches at tlie banauet. Of special interest was the announcement that the Association was pressing the project of getting the University administration to allow members of alumni families to enter the freshman class in September. 
Placements for XD students in summer jobs was under the direction of Tom Kavnnagh. Some 20 students requested help in locating summer work along their line of study.

Alumni Hall was the official residence for most of the fellows, but quite a few found themselves sheltered at the La Salle, Oliver, and Hoffmann Hotels—to say nothing of the stadium, fire house, golf course, etc, etc Every­one who attended the Smoker and Buffet held at the Indiana Club on Friday night wlU long remember the good old-fashioned bull-sessions typical of '31 stalwarts. At exactly 11 P.M., there were S2 members present—and 82 mem­bers were all talking at the same time. I'm trj-ing to figure out who was doing the listen­ing. Does that matter? 
SWher BODAC Motsett would still be inter­ested to find out who slipped in that extra platter of cold-cuts which caused him no little concern. Those whom he surmised of "un­wittingly" partaking of the cold-cuts also know what a third-degree quiz is like. 
Bert MaMoncy absented himself from the group long enough to pen another classical sonnet, "Could this be South Bend.'*

In particular, the Class of '31'- wishes to thank Ji n Armstrong and Bill Dooley of the Alumni Office for their splendid co-operation to Coach Rank licahy, Dan Clark, Father C. B. Motsett and Dan UalfMn. 
Last, but not least, we wish to thank Jack Saunders, our illustrious president, for a job "well done." Having weathered many storms of discouragement. Jack kept our ship on an even keel and can look forward to being justly relieved of the many duties contingent with his office. In a few years the class of *31 will be returning to Notre Dame for our twentieth reunion. 
"The best reunion under the sun Will be ours in fifty-one."

Son: A grapefruit. . . . and get Into the

"Gorman swears he wouldn't have run it except for Ed's obvious enthusiasm. So now Ed is lioad of the Squirt Co., a grape fruit based soft drink and mixer which is sweeping the nation, from West to East. Ed says it isn't the bigest selling drink yet. but Is in­dubitably the best.

Thanks, Joe, for that fine letter, and because I used so much of it here I'll let pass the in­sulting remark you made at the end of it about why don't I go back to work. I'll be there by the time you read this, back with the Texas- Company in Dayton. I might even have a place to live In.

A report that Ed Hoj-t had switched his employment loyalties from Best & Co. to Vick Chemical Co., both Xew York was checked and found to be true. Ed was formerly credit manager at Best's and is now in charge of the foreign credit department at "Vick. How're we fixed for nose drops for the coming winter, Ed? 
Pink Carroll phoned to say that he had re­ceived a letter from Jimmy Gomez from down 

•Bogota, Colombia. S. A., way, where he is doing %-ery well as an architect. Jimmy (also known as Jaime) was to have been married to Maria Olga Poro on Aug. 11. He -would like to hear from some of the boys and can be reached by writing to: Jaime Hoyos Gomez. Calle 18, No. S-.19, Apartmento 302, Bogota. 
 around a golf course. These '36ers, par­ at the reunion, are, left to right, Tom Grady, 
Columbia, S.A. Pinky also mentioned that Jimmy would like to receive the local (X.Y.) "Alumni News." Jero' Gillespie, who is labor­ing so diligently to put the N. Y. sheet across, will be flattered to have a request from so far away. Pinky also mentioned that his brother-in-law. A! Sclnvartx, was passing out cigars again in May. This time, like the pre­vious two, it was also a boy: Freddy. Al also has James and John, for all of which Notre Dame can breathe a deep sigh of relief and prepare for at some future registration day. Ed lluiskinc: is reported to have seen Gene Ling of Hollywood closing in on the F.B.I, for background material on a future moider-movie script. 
.\t one of our recent Tuesday luncheons at tlie Woodstock here I ran across Jack ^Valsh* former Navy lieutenant, and now connected with tlie local branch of the Better Business Bureau. Jack, or "Judge" as Vince Probst was wont to call liim. (by the way. what ever became of Fritz) still retains the dapper man­ner. He says he sees a good bit of his old cronies: George Lone, Ken Moriarity and George IHIson. Incidentally. Cy Stroker's name came up at the luncheon, so will any one (including Cy) knowing of his where- and what-abouts please get in touch with me. Also at tlie "Woodstock luncheon mentioned above was Justin 3lcCann, now back with Haire Publishing Co. 
A few days after that luncheon I bumped into Bob Weaver, (N, T. F.B.I.-er) in the Penns>-lvania Station environs. If I*m not mistaken, I believe Bob* told me Johnny 0'l«ar>'t his sidekick in the P.B.I., had left the bureau to resume business pursuits in th*; Windy City. Incredible as it may seem, i. e., for anyone to leave New York willing to go to Chicago to live and work, I think that's what Bob told me. In fact, it wouldn't sur­prise me at all if the siren call of Ohio wouldn't lure Bob back to his old legal stamping ground* 
**Boot»" (Lt. Comdr. to you, chum) HcCar­thy is said to be stationed at Lido Beach. Long Island. N. T., which I understand is delightful work if you can get it. In all honesty it should be pointed' out that when you are "stationed" at Lido Beach it is much the same as being stationed at that bungalow Doris Duko operated in Hawaii. Anyway, we're glad for "Boots' " sake, since he has decided to stay in the Navy for a while. On the other hand, we understand brother Joe Schilling is on the way out as a lieutenant commander. 
And (as that distinguished Broadway journa­list would say) "now for a look at the mail, if time will allow," which of course it will. The month's purple palm aw^ard for the Hnest (and only) letter recei\'ed since our last ses­sion goes to Arch Gott, who writes: "I see that you have taken over the duties of Paal Fcrfey in the 'Alumnus* for the class of '37. My acquaintance with the magazine was ver>­casual during the war as I never stayed in one place long enough for many of the issues to find me. Last January I was released from the Navy after IS months at sea and on the last trip (from Japan) I stood on the fantall bidding farewell to each and every drop of water in the Pacific—I had grown to know them all by first, last and middle names. Since my return, I have resumed my work with International Harvester Co. in sales promo­tion with the Motor Truck Division. With a great expansion program on the way, this com­pany is really stepping out with seven league boots. Although we are living temporarily in Beverly Hills, we do get into town occasion­ally in the evening to see some of the old chums. Joe Doryon is back doing a swell Job selling travel advertising for the "Chicago Daily News" and has just recently told us of his engagement to a mighty nifty little critter. Joe is in great shape, except that he is still hopelessly a White Sox fan. 
"Ferd 'Lefty' Rjdell is seen about town frequently and meets Joe and me for lunch in the Loop on occasion. Ferd is auditor for the Greyhound Corp. and his office is in the Board of Trade building with all the other bigtime operators. Just at the moment he is having housing difficulties (like all the rest of us Windy Cityites). Saw John Coyle a few nights back and John is selling lumber for the Edw. Hincs Lumber Company. He says it is much better than peeling spuds in the Army. 
"Bob Cronin is selling and administering with the Knickerbocker Roofing Company and is In and out of town quite a bit. Bob and the rest of us are certainly missing the presence of the late Dick Carroll, who was really the spark of the gang. Still seems like Dick Is one of us and I know it will always be that way. 
"Well, Frank. I enoyed reading all the news about the boys in the last issue. Give my regards to all the boys In Noo Yawk and especially to that old Hawaiian, Ed Ho>-t/* 
Incidentally, Arch's letterhead bears the address: 611 W. Roosevelt Rd., Chicago 7, c/o International Har\'ester Co. 
I called Jim McHush for lunch, as I in­dicated I would do in the last issue of the "Alumnus," but so far we haven't gotten to-getiier—through no fault of Jim's, however. We will though and I'll have a full report next time. 
Coincidence struck me twice but in different places recently and wliat brings one Incident to mind is an item in the last issue of" the "Alumnjus" about a Notre Dame gathering at the American Chemical Society meeting in Atlantic City. N. J., in May. Although I did spend a day and a night at the meeting, I missed the Notre Dame gathering. But the day I was leaving I happened to get into the same taxi with a nun. w^hose garb was strictly of the Holy Cross variety. She confirmed It and turned out to be Sister Marie Consolata. of the chemistry department of St. Mary's of Notre Dame. When I allowed as how I had been to Notre Dame, the gracious Sister and 

I had quite a chat about old times. She told me about the Notre Dame party, but un­fortunately, the day after. 
On the other hand, commuting- out to Long Island, where we are spending the summer, a man sitting- next to me in the train en­gaged me in conversation about an editorial I had been reading in the ">^- Y. Times." After a few preliminaries, in which it turned out that I was a Notre Dame man, my fellow-traveler, a Mr. Lynch, of Brooklyn, mentioned that he knew Joe XoftiK, -when Joe was a life guard on Fire Island. Not only that but Supreme Court Justice Hammer, father of tlie Rev. Edwurd Hammer, '34, has a summer place just down the road a piece from our place. All of which proves that a bird in the hand is not always of the badminton variety. 
From Tonj- O'Boyle: 
"I managed to achieve civilian status a month or so ago, and I*m afraid my subsequent enoyment of this forgotten mode of living has made me rather negligent to such duties as contributing to the Alumni Fund. I trust the enclosed check will suffice to atone for my laxity." 
"I married a Marywood College girl in Oct­ober, 1944 and my newly acquired brother In­law, Maurice J. Rcinin, graduated from Notre Dame in 1931." 
"ily service time with the army amounted to three and a half years of comparative quiet. I -was assigned to a Provost Marshal unit and a short time later transferred to a military intelligence crew. I spent about half my time attending investigative schools and then toward the end -^vorking- with American G.I. prisoners who had run afoul of our Army regulations— chiefly 'black market' and desertion offences. Following my discharge I secured an assign­ment with tlie VA as training officer. Duties with this agency include such miscellaneous items as supervision, employment, placement, and Investigation."

From Hal WUliams: 
First of all, a deep apology to Brother Ambrose Nonrak. C.S.C., athletic director of Holy Trinity High School in Chicago. Brother Ambrose wrote me a letter in March and some­hojv it became misfiled in my complicated filing system. I just turned It up. 
Brother writes, '*Johnny Murphy, '38, became the sixth Notre Dame man to join the Chicago Catholic League. Preceding him to Chicago were Al McGnff (Weber), Emmett Murphy (St. Mel's), Red Gleason (St. Leo's). 3Iax Bumell (St. George) and Johnny Jordan (Mt- Carmel). 
As I penned the above the names of WallT Fromhart, also at Mt. Carmel. and of PfrfTerle at St-Mel's also come to mind. 
"But to Murphy goes the honor of becoming a coach in the baby member of the Catholic league and also at a school conducted ex­clusively by Notre Dame men, the Brothers of Holy Cross. 
"A note of humor might be injected. Holy Trinity is as Irish as Hancewic* or JaxwSk> Boys out for the team bear such names as Szczerbowski, Jarosz, StachowskI, Czewski and Walsh. Johnny will need all of the luck he can get because Trinity is only in its second year of football and very much in the process of building." 
Next came an announcement of ordination of Dom August, Peter SIDLER from the Prior and Community of Portsmouth Priory. He was ordained by His Excellency the Most Rev. Francis P. Keough, D.D.. Bishop of Provi­dence, on June 15. He celebrated his first solemn high mass on June 23 at the Church of St. Gabriel. Riverdale. New Tork City. 
Congratulations, Gus. I'm sure that the classmates will remember you in their prayers. 
Ed Brennan wrote In May that he was dis­charged from the Navy on January 7 after 43 months of service. He returned immediately to Iiis pre-war post with 1*. F. McCIure, pub­lishers' representative, in Chicago, on the Chi­cago staff of "Aero Digest." His home address is 4414 Parker Ave., Chicago. 
In June, Ed sent a report on the Chicago contingent. He writes, "We regret to an­nounce that our dispatch Is colored with tragedy. Greg Kell>', a B-29 navigator, re­ported missing after a Tok>*o mission, is now presumed dead by the War Department. 
"A war time change that we didn't know about, until we saw him recently, concerns dapper, bow-tied John Bourke who has taken his talents to Fr>'e. Lawson & Co., consulting engineers. Father of a daughter. John's head­quarters is in Chicago's Field Building. On the otlier side of town, the future of Mont­gomery Ward's merchandising empire has been buttressed by the return of John Clifford to the company's advertising department, drug division. 
"In nearby Milwaukee we chanced upon ro­bust, voluble Dan Gibbs, salesman for the Lake Shore Electrotype Co. A former Navy carrier pilot, Dan is the father of a daughter and lives in suburban Oak Park. We can't bring you up-to-date on the peregrinations of John Thoma:^ but we do know that he's no longer witli TWA. 
"The erstwhile roommates. Bill Armcl and Len Skogland, are nurturing a bumper crop of youngsters with Bill in the lead by one. An ace salesman for Nubian Paint and Varnish, Bill's responslbilites have increased to the extent of three daughters. Len, treasurer of the tool making firm of Scully-Jones, has two sons. 
"A one-time Chlcagoan who has forsaken the pomp of the "Tribune" for the grandeur of the Rockies is Jack Hughes. Out of the army since Februarj* and settled in Colorado Springs. Jack literally is cleaning up in his newest venture—the laundry business. As we write this, long, but not so lean anymore. Xt. IVank 0*I<aaghUn awaits his discharge from the Army. We don't know yet whether Frank will return to his job as salesman for Consolidated Coal. Chicago," 
Thanks, Ed, for another bright and newsy letter. I wish some of the other boys would come through with letters like that. 
While in Frederick recently I saw Jack Lebherx, 39, who Is now out of the army after a long tour of duty in the Pacific. Jack is , still taking things easy, but hopes to return to school in the fall.

From Jack Patterson: 
Charlie Dillon and I traveled from Pitts­
burgh to South Bend over U. S. Route 30. We 
wiiizzed through Paris, Cairo and Lisbon,— 
Ohio, that is; we saw a Sherman tank parked 
in a village frontyard and an anti-tank gun 
perched on a lawn in another village- We 
glanced quickly and passed on, hoping not to 
become involved in a feud. We rode out a 
rainstorm from Canton to Massillon, had to 
search Ft. Wayne for a hotel room, finally got 
one in a hotel where Room 100 was on the 
fourth floor and Room 400 on the first floor. 
"We arrived in South Bend Friday morning June 2S, with our coats off and our neckties in our pockets. The temperature hovered around the boiling point. 
The trip was unique to the two of us- The stay in South Bend was a common experience —and an exceptionally successful reunion—for more than GO members of the *41 class. 
These '41ers experienced hot, sunny weather and one short thunderstorm (which, by the way, caught law student Jack Bnriie Iialf way be­tween Alumni and the main parking lot). They saw a golf course whose trees have now reached an adolescent, if not an adult, stage. They ordered breakfast, lunch and a dinner or two in a caf that still smells like it lias just been mopped. They noticed that the street cars aren't running any more, that the streets over which they once ran are surfaced like corn cobs. They ate spaghetti at Rosie's and liked it as well as ever. They ate steaks at Kugler's and paid without grumbling. They went into the Club Lido for the first time— it says here—and found that it was just another joint that lost its glamor when the "verboten" sign wasn't up. They noticed that Walgreen's and Hook's are still sitting cross-corner _ from one another. But they didn't go in. They found that the Drewrj* brewery was oh strike and said it's a fine thing with a big reunion going on. And beer was short, but bourbon wasn't- In Pittsburgh it works the other way around. They discovered a new beer emporium in South Bend appropriately named Sweeney's Shamrock. And it wasn't off limits to anyone, students included. 
Quietly they noticed that the Sacred Heart Church still towers, with the Golden Dome, above the campus. They saw the church still packed, the communion lines still long. They beard more of the men who pray at the Grotto before exams. They saw the statue of Father Sorin and some new statues that have been made part of some campus buildings. 
Best of all, they saw friends. And it was surprising how names and faces were eas>' to 'remember. A few slip-ups, of course, but nothing like most expected on the trip out. 
There wore '41 grads now studying law— Jark Burkv, Bill Carbire, Joe McNerthney, BUI Daly. There was Dick Ball, now teaching in tlie Commerce School. Phil Sheridan, who graduated Sunday, was one of pick's students. They all showed up at the Oliver at one time or another—not in the coffee sliop—in the Blarney Room where you have to drink a beer sitting down and you can't sing even if you play in the instrumental trio. 
Blarney flowed in the Blarney both Friday, and Saturday nights. And there were so many visitors, I'd just like to name them in a kind of roster—with a few remarks on the side. 

tarry Bracken was there from Brooklyn, Jim Broffger from Erie, Matt Byrnes of the Canadian Byrnes*. Joe Callahan, Carbine, Daly, McNerthny and Barlce. Gene Dslay came from ­St. Paul without brother Paul. I>ank Daody was there from Chicago as were Rubs Mar­quardt, Don KxaloTcc and Gns Ryan. Dick Dora—I last saw him on a British ship headed for England In 1942—popped up again. Al Frericks was there with brother Ted. Cbnck Goinor made eves at the female violinist—as did most ever>'one in the place. Jim Gartland came in from Marion. Ind. Hany Gottron, Phil Johnson, Jim O'Hara, Bill Kramer, IVank lAnk and Bill 3iul.i::ey where there. John H. Kelly 
The Notre Dame Alumnus 
of Akron represented the Kelly clan. Frank McDonoagrb. Jim McGavern (with a fine head of skin) and Bill McVay reanioned. Matt Mil­lenbacb of Michgan, Rocco Montesna of Chi­cago, John Martell of Kankakee—they came from ever>-where. From the south, deep that is. came Claghorn Tom Morrison with his brother FaoL Jimmy Newland put his India­napolis, paper to bed and came to South Bend John &I>cti left Chicago's stockyards; Jeny O'Dowd came from Ft. Wayne- Al Perrine was still in his Navy uniform at the Oliver. 
Jack IACSS and the Mrs. arrived on Sunday with Erwin Mooney in tow. I^inis "Tex" RiescI made the trip as did Bob Pohl, Gene Rj-an and the Mrs., Jim Tinney and the Mrs., Bob Sass, John Scully, John Sievert, B:ib Slack, Tom Talty, Jim Tcacarden, and Bill lYllsan. 
Those arc them. 
Any omissions are purely unintentional. 
As to the return trip, Charlie and I got to Bucyrus before the engine started to smoke. It was Sunday night. There were no people and no 'sidewalks in Bucyrus. The car was fixed hy Mondaj- afternoon. It started to rain again and kept it up all the way. But we got home. And we're glad we went back to Notre Dame. Though we may do it on a train the next time—we'll bo there in 1951. 
3lilt Piepal and Jim Slurphj- couldn't make it to the reunion. But they both sent letters. Milt's from Dartmouth where he's coaching and Jim's from Sheppard Field. Texas, where he's a sergeant in army finance. 
Milt, as many of his friends know, is'marrled to the former Lucille Somerset of Methuen, Mass. They went-to the 500-mile Indianapolis race In June, then attended the Joe Gillespie-Betty O'Connor wedding. They were out at South Bend a little before reunion time and ran Into Bill Kr-nncdy ('42) and Jack R>*ar— who's now married to Bill's sister. Marj- Ellen. Jack is at Indiana Law School. 
Like I did with the boys at the Oliver, MI!t has listed some of tlie friends he's run into at various times. They are: B^b and Jim FltiseiaTd, Dick O'Connor, Walt O'^Icara, Norm Avmbley. Norm is coaching in Elaine. 
Milt missed the old-timers' game but got, as he says, the gory details fom Burke, Car­bine and Daly. 
Jim Murphy is sweating out his discharge. He's especially anxfous to get out so that he can get home to his wife and two children, get used to being a husband and father again. 
Jim has run into Ed Graham, former room­mate of Bert Kelly in AValsh. Others of • the *41 class who have shown up at Sheppard are John Gnincy, Red Stork, and Bill Demling:. Joe Budkler is married, has a son, and Is out of the Army. Al Mago, says Jim. was stationed at last report at 33 Pine St., X. Y. C. He is a lieutenant "grade unknown" in the U.S.N.

From Scoop Scanlun: 
Tom Fallon, late of the U. S. Na\-j-, was one of the most interested spectators at the pro tennis championsliips at Forest Hills. N. Y., early in July. I bumped into Tom, well redden­ed by the summer sun, while trying to learn what keeps Bill Tilden moving at the age of 53-plus. 
Tom had some news of various Easterners who assembled in Mid-May at the Empire Ho­tel in New York City—a '42 Niglit, small scale. Bill Gmd}- was there as was Gene O'Brien, the "promoter" of the gathering. Sam Boyle was there too, but anxious to get away for one of his frequent nights to Holyoke, Mass.,—to see Grady's sister. Ed O'Kane, recently married and living in Xew Jersey, was on hand along with Harry Flannigan, currently a major at­traction in a women's apparel firm in the New York garment district, reports Fallon. Georse Gonj-ean, Rocky Momn and Joe lAne completed the list of Who's Who there. Lane is working in a New York law office waiting for Notre Dame to re-open in the fall and Moran is at Columbia. 
Fallon, who was an athletic oHlcer in Tom Hamilton's efficient Navy staff, saw much ser­vice at Hawaii and liked to talk about the short reunions witli many Notre Damers there. "We had about 2,000 Notre Dame men through Hawaii,'! '^°'^ recalls. Among those who quick­ly came'to mind were: Jim O'Xeill, Jim Bratz and father Dupnis. Tom is attending Columbia, aiming at a master's degree in phy-ed and-education. 
Relayed from Detroit via John I,ynch '44 is this message: "One of the lads of '44 asked me to send a line about his brother. It goes like this: Ed Miller was married June 27 to Mar­garet Kcllett at Rochester, N. Y., and Jake Reichenstein hustled up from Dallas, Texas to lend his assistance. 
"Sorrj- you couldn't make the big reunion. Jack Patterson, Jim Xewlaiid and some of the big wheels were around. Jack is working in Pittsburgh with Tom Powers and Jim is Federal Building reporter in Indianapolis." ' 
From the Marine Station at Solomons, Mari'­land on June 13 came this communique from Capt. Jim 0'I,auKhUn: 
"Sorry about being overdue on correspondence —I'll do better from now on. Been selected for transfer to the Regular Marine Corps. I thought all along of applying but considered it for some time before submitting THAT LETTER. Last week I received advanced information that as of 1 August I report for duty to the Judge Advocate General of the N.avy, and as of 1 Octo­ber I go to the U. S. Xaval Academy post­graduate course in L.aw at George W^ashington University. That was good news to me and I feel ver>- lucky to have been selected,—however I understand it's really a three-year grind. 
"The Notre Dame club of Washington, D. C, has quite a few functions tliese days—haven't met too many fellows we know—most of the alumni there are old-timers. Imagine you won­der where this place is—well, it's about 60 miles from Washington located on the Patuxent River —verj-fine fishing down this way. 
"l>an Hohvell is located at anotiier naval base about a mile from here and he is the only one I've been able to contact recently." 
Faithful Tom Powers came through with this note in late June: 
"Am enclosing a letter from Joe lane. At­tended the ND Club's golf party here in Pitta-burgh on June 9; Met a lot of ND'ers of all classes, Bemie Conroy Hash Gallagher, Jobn McMohon. P. J. McAidle. Larry Enricht. Hash Doyle, irhitey Hanlon, Doc O'TooIe. Doc Dineen, John (yDonnell Jim Dnggan. Will Rice, B. V. Chamberlain. No '42ers there. Fted Bcckman Is with the American Coating Mills and he's all set to go to Columbia in the fall." 
Squibs from Lane's letter: 
"l"anl Nei-ille flew into LaGuardia on Mem­orial Day week-end en route to family reunion in Ware, Mass. Had time enough for a visit before being off by train to Springfield. At the Notre Dame club meeting at the Park Lane on June 12 I met some of the old class­mates, to wit:Ed O'Kane, Rocky Moran, Faol Ullis, Charlie Kirbj-, Jerry Raebett, Bed Martin and Jim Traeey. 
"Have gone to the bitter extreme and started working for the summer. Last week I started working as an investigator for Legal Aid Soci­ety, Criminal Court Branch in Manhattan. So I spend my days pounding the pavement, mostly in H.irlem, lining up witnesses and digging up facts." 
In Stay, Lt. (jg) Georce Uhl wrote: .. "This is written en route from Pearl Harbor to San Diego where I'll be stationed until I get but in July. John Donnelly- has gone home for discharge and Tom Teamey is still with us in Squadron Seven on the Submarine Chivo. Tom and I got together quite often just before we left Pearl." [Ed's note: Teamey is now "out"3. 
In Mid-July, with the pro footballers and the colleges making plans for the fall, some of the boys we know jumped back into the news. Brutz was among those (lying to California with the Chicago Rockets and Ed Kopshever signed as .issistant coach at Loras College, Dubuque, la.

The Tuesday after the reunion the Detroit Club mot and '43ers present included Kd llickey. Herb Melt<m. and myself- Plenty of fellows from other classes there also that we knew. A really good old fashioned beer, bull, and pretzel party. 
Xext social event on the '43 calendar is BUI Moorh7::d*K marriage to Helen Healy on 13 July. It was a *43 affair in every way. Chuck 3Iur­phy was best man and Ed Hickey and Jim B}-me were two of the ushers. Other '43 men seen at eitlier the ceremony or reception were Drs. Geonce Refoerdy, Bill O'Connell, and IMUIS I^iJoie and newly discharged Joe Hillebrand. Also present ^^•as Prof. FVank O'Malley up from, summer teaching in Chicago.

Another big '43 wedding that took place June 22 was tliat of I>o Keating and I/onlse He Ircl. DonV sister. Quite a group of '43ers were expected but no report has reaches me as yet so I can report no more. The Navy kept me from attending. 
Let's get on to the letters. That one I sent to all of the class evidently arrived most places. At least only the following envelopes were returned as undelivered: Geonpe Coppin, John Brcfamer, Georje Blackmore, Gerald Cur­rier and Tom Volbcrdinxr. i would appreciate the addresses of any of them, as the University needs them. 
Several answers came in since the letter went out and the first was from AI Maench. In fact it arrived so long ago, only three or four days after the letter was sent out. that I have temporarily misplaced it. It was newsy though and will appear in next issue, (I hope). Thanks verj- much, AI, for your almost Im­mediate reply, and the best of luck with the recreation business. 
Steve Ensner'fi was the second to arrive and wrote: "Let it be known that your efforts to keep the class Informed do not go unappreciat­ed. I know from past experience that it is a lot of work, seemingly wasted on a bunch that shows so little response. Keep It up. 
"My news is not spectacular. I was finally discharged from the Na\-y here in San Fran­cisco in March. Tried to start a laundry but couldn't quite swing it. Ha\*e decided to stay In California—can't face that midwestern win­ter. Also have an eight-room house in Berke­ley which I would hate to give up. Am work­ing in Oakland now, for Pittsburgh Plate Glass. Win go Into sales work, despite :ilr. Chizek's intensive accounting training. TVas all set for Stanford's graduate school, but decided against It. 
"Only Xotre Dame class mate that I can report on reliably is Jim McElroy. He is out of the Na\-y also, working for ABC in Xew York. 
•Would like to see old Jim, but can't quite swing it this j'ear. Incidentally, I would ap­preciate any addresses of our class mates that reside In the SP bay area. J know of none of them out here. 
"Afraid that I won't make the reunion this year. Have high hopes of going to South Ameri­ca soon. Excellent deal, if It goes through. If "so, will marry a local California girl. Advise anyone else interested In going to Sur de Ameri­ca, to check with the USES in "Washington." 
Thanks Steve- 3Iy list shows no more men in the San Francisco area. 
Fred Christman tj-ped this out June 13: 
"I did get to see quite a few fellows from our 

class and those of other classes at the various 
meetings that I attended at the Notre Dame 
Alumni Club In Honolulu. Even though we were 
far from home, the old ND spirit existed and 
I certainly enjoyed ever>' meeting that I was 
able to attend. The last meeting that I at­
tended was in Januar^' and at that time I 
got to see three fellows that I had not seen 
since graduation- They were Bart Ramsour, Bob 
KoK«rs, and Herb Melton. 
"Shortly after this January meeting, I was on my way back to the states. My discharge from the Army was on the ISli of February. 
"Since my return to Terre Haute in April, I have been with my father In the plumbing and heating business. My brother, John, Is also in with me- Dad is teaching us the busi­ness so that before too long he will be able to retire and we will carrj- on for Iiim- . . 
"I liave received my card as 'a contributor to the Fourth Annual Alumni Fund. It is the nicest I Iiave ever seen put out by any Uni­versity. I am very proud of it and it is really a credit to the University. Having the Joyful, Sorrowful, and Glorious Mysteries on the oppo­site side is very nice. As %vas stated, the surest way to the Mother's heart Is through her favor­ite devotion, the Holy Rosary­
"Just in case you are wondering, I am still single. My brother and I have an apartment to­gether in the same building as our parents. Any­time you or ony of the fellows of our class are in Terre H:iute be sure to give me a ring because I Avould be most happy to see a fellow class­mate." 
A swell letter, Fred. 

Jack Griffin wrote to change his address to G156 X. Knox Ave., Chicago 30. Make it a bit longer next time, will you. Jack? 
A letter written at sea off the East Coast Is one from Bob Murphy: 
"As you see I am now on board that greatest of all ships, the LST . . . Since last July, I have .been touring up and down the East coast on this ship, from Boston to Key West, and In the process have run Into a few of our class­mates and one or two other ND men of earlier and later vintage than our class. In Boston I saw Alnce Slatt and his family while our ship was in there • -­
"Since our graduation I have had a wise and varied travelogue. First, I went to work for Lockheed, building patrol bombers for the Na\'y. I have my old job waiting there when I get out. After 20 months in their engineering dept, I got a commission in the Navy as a deck oflicer and I hit the road. I hit all Stateside duty but some of it was in spots where the last human was primitive man, such as Fort Pierce, Fla. . -I believe I can get released to inactive duty July 15, but if I don't I will be out In August- Then don't know If 1 will go back to work or go to grad school somewhere - . . 
Thanks for the news, Bob-Edgewood Arsenal and Fred Hoth shot this this our way: "I have been writing and receiving letters from some of the fellows in the class of '43, namely; Julian Ativater, who Is a Lt. (jg) at the Naval Ammunition Depot at St. Juliens Creek, Va.; Pete Gancini, who Is taking a radar course at Great Lakes; and Jotm "Mac" Mc­Dowell, who is with Ball Band still in Mish­awaka. Mac and his wife had a new arrival, a girl, in their family recently. Julian, I believe, intends to return to N. D. In the fall for grad­uate work. Pete tells me that Roland Martcl is also taking a radar course in Chicago and tliat Johnny' Kerstcn, who, upon completing three years pre-med at N. D. and then attend­ing Northwestern Med School, is now a doctor 
The Notre Dame Alumnus 

and will enter the Army as a first lieutenant 
in July. 
"I've been fortunate In meeting a few of our classmates while In the Army myself. I ran Into Jartc Russell when I was at Ft. McCIel­lan, Ala., in 1944 and I believe I also saw Fbil Steropoli. The biggest surprise I got here at Edgewood Arsenal a few months back. I am an Instructor in the Chemical Warfare Training Center here- One day as I was teaching a new bitch of trainees, I rcognized an old fa­miliar face- It was Jim Fagan who struggled throuh Chemical Engineering for four years at Notre Dame. Jim had been working as a civilian before induction with' the Ordnance Dept- In Washington . . . Next week I'm looking for­ward to the pin-stripe suit and the straw hat. However, I think I shall never regret my Army days the same as I shall ne\*er regret my four years at Notre Dame. But I shall be glad to be back home with my wife and two children. Patsy and Mike. Mike's going to Notre Dame about 1962! 
"I would like to hear some news about Bill Bonjmi and the other fellows I've lost contact with." 
Theres plenty of news in that epistle. I for one didn't know you were married, much less had two little ones. Thanks loads for writing-I wish I could print news about ever>-one but I can't unless someone tells me about them. Letters are what keep the column going. 
The Bronxvlllc thrush. Hank Kane, came through with the following: 
"I was separated a short time ago Iiere In New York. I wound up my Navy career a Lieutenant, as you did. and was exec on the Alasklan. AKA 55. for a few months before I left her. I was detaclied at Portland. Ore., and stopped off in the "Windy City" on my way home. I spent just an afternoon there, but it was long enough to read Arch Ward's column and visit with my chubby friend. Lee Raymond. Lee was applying for a job with an advertising agency that afternoon. He must have given me the bug. for I started with the Kenyon and Eckhardt agency, liere In New York a short time ago. I'd like to hear how Lee is making out there. 
"I bumped Into Bill Scully a couple of weeks ago on the train to Westchester. The red-headed thrush is still in good voice and looks great. 
"If you see Ed Hickey give him my best regards. Tell him we followed him for a few hundred miles on the Pacific but alas—T didn't know he was aboard the President Adams. 
"I hear Chuck Gulden is at Law School at N. 

D. now—happily married too. Joe Hilletwand spent a weekend with me in Bronxville a short time ago. He should be back in Toledo and out of the Nav>* now. What do you hear from Bill Fiye? What's his address?" 
You can still sing—.-ind write. Hank. 1*11 write you Frj-e*s address as soon as I can. And look for me around Army game time- I'll give you a ring. 
The last letter arrived yesteday. Don Guy at MIT Grad School had this to say: 
"Here's a report from an '43 ex Aero En­gineer who can give you the dope on the rel­ative difficulty of Engineering and Business . . . 
"I met Jalian Atwater, a Navj- lieutenant, at Norfolk, about five weeks ago before I was released. Of course he was standing at the "O" Club bar and noticed my ring. He was a chem. engineer. Jf>e Fur d is a chem. engineer grad­uate student here at Mass, Inst, of Tech. I be­lieve he graduated In September '43. 
"The past three years of my life have been spent in the Naval Air Transport Service, from Bermuda to the continent of Australia and North. I was in the ND Club in Honolulu dur­ing 1944. 
"I was discharged a lieutenant last month and entered M.I.T. at that time. I am taking Business and Enginering Administration here for the next year and half, leading toward an 
M. S. 
"I was stationed last year at LaGuardla . Field in N. Y. City with Joe Jacobs, Mel Bam­
mel, 4oe Mannion and Tnacy (the electrical engineer) so had little or no trouble with N. D. contacts. I met Jim Drianer, the shot putter, one dark night a couple years ago, in Austra­lia, at an airport outside of Brisbane. He was purser on an ammunition ship.'* 
Thanks a lot, Don. 
•\Vhile setting discharged at Great Lakes, I saw Jack Tallett and his mother, father, and pretty sister, Joan, at their home in Wauke­gan. They are wo nderful hosts and I was lucky in that it was Joan's birthday and I had some of her ice cream and cake. 
On the way home I spent an evening in Clii­cago but had no luck picking up news. Gail Fitch was out; "Bttlldos" Raymond had a date; Fred Gore's phone isn't listed; and there are too many Stnrms to really track down Quince. 
That finishes everj-tliing but the shouting. And I do want to shout just a bit about the Alumni Fund. At the time of the reunion we were doing pretty well, but only about 45% of the class had contributed. Let's try and make it 100% this year. One thing to remember— be sure and put your class on your check so we'll get proper credit. And it's not when you graduated but what class you started with that counts. All those that started in Septem­ber, 1939, arc members of *43. One fine fellow sent in $100 last month and didn't realize he was in our class. 
Let's all kick in and write in. 
Paul Nrvillc, MS, reportorial mainstay of the South Bend "Tribune," forwards a letter from Johnnjr Powers, who says, " We're all laying plans for the Army-Notre Dame don­neybrook in November. Ton> McCreedy is work­ing for Pil distilleries in Baltimore as a hu­midity engineer and draws extra pay on the side as an investigator for the Burns Detective Agency. Besides my five-day week job here at Eastern Air Lines I work six nights a week at Roosevelt Raceway (harness racing) in "West­bury, L. I., selling mutuel tickets at the J2 window."

From John L}-nch: The Fourth Annual Alumni Fund and tlie General Reunion of June 2S-30 have lately served as rallying points for the class. As of May 31, the class of '44 was heading the Alum­ni.Fund list, witli .415% of the class already reported. And, judging from the volume of mail since then, the good work is going on. As for the reunion, it was a success. And I have that straight from the bartender in ^the Hoffmann. It was such a success, in fact, that plans are already under way for a special '44 reunion at the Southern California game, Nov. 30 at Notre Dame. 
More about that later, however. Right now a Jock H'oelfle dispatch Is waiting. Jack has for­saken his interests in the advertising field for the time being, and. If we are to believe his stationery, is a "special agent" for the New York Life Insurance Co. Cutting out the sales talk, we find the following news, as of May 15: 
"I had a very nice visit with Father John Burice last week. He spent the day at my home and met my fiancee and sisters. We hashed over old times, and Al Zoilo dropped over to fresh-' en our memories on a few things we had for­gotten. I spoke to Cliariie Koecler on the'phone the otiier night. He's breezing right along out there at school . . . Funny thing. Father Burke asked me if I knew anything about a publi­cation called 'The Green Banner.' Naturally I told him I had never heard of it. 
"I attended the Notre Dame Club of New "Vork meeting a while back, and they have a vorj- solid organization there. I saw Paul Ul­lis, Ted Toole, and a few other notables. I've yet to hear from Bill Schroedcr. He said he wouldn't write until he landed overseas, so I take it he's still floating around one of the local concentration camps. Had a nice letter from Ed Steiner a few weeks back. He's still in Dayton, but I don't know what he's doing." 
Jack's letter just missed the last issue of the "Alumnus." as did the next one on hand. Bill Schench's last from Green Cove Springs, Fla. On May 15 Bill was hoping for no more than six weeks' duty before he would be out. 
"Since I lost wrote I have run into a number of ND men. and also had a chance to drop in at school. First in mind is good old ex-roomie 3like 3IalIoy. He came down here around the loth of Starch, and we had a few good times together before he got his discnarge on 15 April. V.'as over at the BOQ one night with Mike and ran into Joe Fiirmer and Red Trimborne, a couple of '44 men. Joe is exec on the DE 510 here, and up till a short while ago Red was here. But the latest scuttle-butt is that a change of orders brought him legal work in Chicago. 
"A ten day leave brought me to South Bend to see the future "little woman.' and, of course, a chance to see some of the lads. Ex-'44'3 all over the place. To trj* and name a few—Joe Pons, Bill Martin, Vamey Vync, Jeny O'Reilly, Johm Qaiiia, all in the Oliver. On the campus it wasKnMk GnTOi. Bob 3Ulfonl, BUI Wal­dran, mt s Faal^ Bob Casey, Johnny Mammm, Back GaUacher, J«e Fatmcco, and so many more that I can't think of right now. Happen­ed into old (forge's one evening and who was sitting at the bar but Ji n Flatt, ex-roomIe from Sorin days, drinking a glass of milk (they were out of hops). He was just back from 20 months in the Pacific, and can't say that he looks the worse for It." 
The first of the letters resulting from our efforts in the Alumni Fund drive is from Jade Monui of Chicago. It opens with "Enclosed find my contribution . . •", and also brings this news: 
"I am now a young fur man and am very interested in the work. Since my discharge last"winter I have been working here with my Dad. These days are very pleasant ones, and my outlook for the future has picked up con­siderably since Camp Croft basic. In fact, I'm getting married in September. 
"Saw Jack TiMwnton last week, also HDBMT, O'Rouke and Dick Creevy. at BUI Dwyer's wedding. If you ever see Jack Berres, ask him to write. I don't have his address." 
Gleaning paragraphs here and there from some of our letters, we get the following: 
From Dick MUler: 
"Cincinnati College is only one step ahead of ND; we have our co-ed in Mortuary Science. The letterhead ('Funeral Home') is the result of co-op on the side. I'm not in business yet, although I would like to make pre-arrange-• ments for Army. I'm cutting school June 27 to be best man at my brother Ed's wedding in Rochester, N. T. He is ex-'42." 
From Vic Klmmel: 
"I was released from the Navy the early part of May and have been doing absolutely noth* ing since. My days of loafing are numbered, though, as I start Cornell Law School the 1st of July. A few weeks ago I stopi>ed off at school for. a visit, and was amazed to find a great number of our class back there finishing their courses. It certainly was good to see all the fellows." ­
From Tom McLaoshUn: 
"Was discharged from the Army in January this year. Laid around for about six weeks doing nothing, then in March went to work for Jos. E. Seagrams Distillers. At present I am in the Calvert branch, doing accounting. 
"Before I left Oil City for Alexandria, La., where I am. working now, Ray Donan, '43, (roomed with him my last year at ND) married Pat Redfield of Oil City. They are now living in Sioux City, la., Ray's home. Give my regards to Bob MacDonneU, John Morris and Joe DIUMI, if you see them about Detroit." 
From Gnido Alcxandnr: "Wish I could make the reunion, but am very occupied at present. Have been managing a

"Was dlscharETed from the 104th (Timbar­wolf) Division last December. "Was in the same refriment as FUber E. J. Hnrray. Quite a few XD boys there also. Was up to school several months ago to see my old roomie. Bob McBride. Also saw lots of the boys." 
From Hiank Adam, aboard the U. S. S. Osage (LSV-3): "As you can see, I am still caught fast In the toils of the Navi*. But am wriggling pretty hard and expect to extricate myself anytime between the 1st and loth of July. "It has been Quite a while since I have seen an 'Alumnus.' I don't know if my folks have stopped forwarding it or just -what. I have heard from Ted Cnmminics and Red Fa«an* They are both out of the scn-'ice and our friend Ted is getting himself married in Au­gust. I seem to have lost complete track of Jim Gooran and l^oa Bams, John Morrison wrote me recently, but all the news he had "was that he was headed home. "I expect to get up to school for at least one or two games this fall. My own plans for school are pretty indefinite. I expect to seek a master's degree some place (if I can find a place with room), but I may not be at Xotre Dame . . . My best to the Class of '44.'* 
From Dan Downey: "Breezed through ICD in April, but didn't see you around. I threw my hat into .the ring at that time for entry at the September se­mester, but so far no word has been received that would lead me to believe I have been accepted. "Have you heard anything from Jim Cunning­ham? Or any of the charter members of the Sorin Hall Victorj- Garden Association? I heard from Dare Cortin that he planned on invading Cornell since his unsuccessful attempt to re­turn elsewhere." 
From BUI Grafe (originally '45, but graduated in '44): 
"I would like to attend the general reunion, but won't be able to because of my job -with Proctor and Gamble here in CincInnatL After being separated from the Nai-y early this month, began work in the Chemical Division of P. & G. I'm in the development section and like it verj- much. However, I still intend to return to Notre Dame in the fall to continue studying chemical engineering. Hope to see you on the campus sometime." 
' From Earl En^Iert: "Sorry I couldn't make the reunion, but my job with a local (Louisville) refinery prevented me from attending. Wliile out dancing the other night I met a girl from Paducah, Ky., Gas I<eceay*s home town. Gus was my old roomie in Sorin. She informed me that Gus came out of the Xavy as a Lt. (jg) and is the father of a year. old boy. He was married w'hllein-the Navj-'s Diesel school at Cornell in 1944. He Is now working in Indianapolis. "John Goldan of our class is back at school. 'Black Jolin* Morpiiy apparently missed him, perhaps because Johnny is snowed under by the books. At least he was when I visited the cam­pus in May. I am looking forward to return­ing to ND in the fall for grad school - . . Give my regards to the gang." Out of Rochester, X. T., comes the longest piece of mail we have received since the col­umn oi>ened. ]Ranl O'Connell, ex-mlmic and chem student, presently a T/4, is the author. The date is July 2. "It m^ight be well to dispose of my own per­sonal history first, since it Is the least inter­esting of the stories I have to tell. "After graduation in October, 1943. I came to- Rochester to begin graduate work in the Department of Biochemistry, University of Ro­chester, School of Medicine. I was a teaching assistant in biochemistry and my research work pertained to work undertaken by the university through a contract with the Medical Section, Manhattan District Engineers. To put It suc­cinctly, was concerned with medical aspects of the developmet of the atomic bomb. "In August. 1944, I. became winded and the-
draft board finally collared me. After basic training at Camp (Haibome, La. ('Llberamus, Domine'), I w*as returned to Rochester as a member of the Special Engineering Detachment which was carrying out the medical research here. My life continued much as before, except that I did no more teaching and I wore a uniform. 
"In March, 1945, for one of those vague reasons with which anyone who has served In the armed forces is familiar, the enlisted per­sonnel of the Rochester detachment were trans­ferred to inactive status in the ERC (of unla­mented memory). This move actually consti­tuted only a change to civilian clothing, since we were required to continue our research as before. I reveled in the glory of wearing bow ties, sport coats, et al—for a time. But the dream ended In October, 1945, when we were recalled to active duty and discovered that our time in reser\*e did not apply to discharge credit. So I expect to 'sweat out' what has now become exceedingly dull work unil some as yet undetermined time this fall. Then I hope to 
•return to my graduate work, and just a few months before my hair begins greying at the edges, I should be able to tack 'Ph. D.' after my name. 
"That's my story, and I'm sorry It isn't more glamorous (I don't even know the 'secret of the bomb'). Perhaps what I know of some of our other classmates will make better copy. 
"My work entailed a bit of traveling about the USA, but I encountered few ND men. Al Calarco. '43, was a technical consultant at a. plant I visited occasionally near Buffalo. Irr Scliafrner, Ph. D. '44, was at the Metallurgical Labratory in Chicago. *Mac' MdBride, who will be remembered by many chemists and chem engineers of our class as the man who helped us through Dr. ^bmill's physical chemistry course, did some top-secret w*ork for the project. 
"BUI O* Gonnell« of the chem engineering O'Connells. tells me that Jim Unneran and Joe Forrell both worked for the Kellex Corp., the former in New York City, the latter at Oak Ridge. Both are now back at their graduate work at illT- Bill has been working at Du­Pont's rayon and cellophane plant In Buffalo since graduation. Bill also tells me that Gcny Welch is a sales engineer for Union Carbide and Carbon. Norm Mneller is with Rellly Coal Tar in Indianapolis. 
"My two buddies of campus days, John Knha and Jim Cowitantln, have ben consistent cor­respondents durig our ser\-ice days. Our se­ior class prexy is now a 'j. g.', at present at­tached to the Na\-al Air Station. Norfolk. He fxpects to be discharged this month. He receiv­ed Aerology training at the University of Chi­cago in early 1944. Then he was attached to the Naval Air Station at Oakland. Calif., until he boarded a new aircraft carrier, the USS Pa­lau, early this year. He recently completed a cruise from San Diego to Boston, with a stop at the Panama Canal. 
" 'The Const' entered the Army in July. 1944, trained at Camp Wheeler, Ga., and was In the European front lines by Christmas of that year. He distinguished himself there, as has already been reported in the 'Alumnus,' win­ning a Silver Star and a Croix de Guerre, among other hunks of fruit salad. At last re­ports he was a 1st sergeant with his company in the 3rd Division at Hammelburg, Das Reich, but should be home soon. His letters have de­scribed visits to Heidelburg, Oberammergau, London and other points. [Jim made it home In time for the reunion—JL]. 
"Of my other fellow chemists In the class of '44 I have heard little. Charley Baley and Bob "The Voice* Byrnes were both in the Navy. Mandell Zieg:Ier left graduate work at the Uni­versity of Marj-iand to enter the blue and was a *j. g.' at last report. 'Pete* Eveslaffc con­tinued graduate work at ND. but was forced to interrupt his. work this spring because of poor health. Tom Kelly served as a pharma­cist's mate at the Oakland Naval Hospital until May. when he was discharged. His experiences had him toying with the Idea of entering medi­cal school when I last heard from him. 
"I have made two pilgrimages back to the campus since graduation. The first was almost a year ago and was too soon to find many of 
the old gang around. I did see such old friends as Dis. BalfUnj^r^ Boyle, Campbell and others In Chemistry Hall; Itttheis Craddick and Inrinr, and good old Brother Conan, still presiding over the Bookstore. 
"But this last February I returned with Tie Dctttnon to visit my roomie of Alumni Hall days, Faal Marietta. Paul was living ofl­campus with Don Trottier and John Slartin. By that time such stalwarts as IVitz Ftink, Sam Whtgp Hmrry 'Red' SalUvan, Bill Slower, 'Slats* Slater, Dick Klee, Tom Daffy and others were to be seen around Rosie's, the Oliver, and on campus. 
"My third roommate of Alumni Hall, Marie DeMots, was killed in France last July 30. He goes to join those other noble men— Georve Hamilton, Wolly Barton, Gene Zapko, Steve (VBoarke and others. I know they are In the prayers of all our classmates. 
"After my visit to school in February, I went to New Tork City to see John Bright. Ho served in the' Finance Section in North Africa and France, and was discharged as a sergeant last December. After pounding the pavements for several weeks, he finally landed a job in his own home town of Rutherford, N. J. I guess he's still there; the old boy owes me two letters. 
**BiIl Kellow, the mall-man of Walsh Hall days, finished at Georgetown last spring and is now interning in Washington. Here at Ro­chester, rete Stewart, a football manager of our day, recently finished his internship. And Tony Flnarelll, '45, is in his last year. Jim Skimgherty, a loyal ND V-12er, Is a third year man. Of aftairs marital—^Herti CIaric*s first anniversary comes up next month. PhU (of the Denver Clarkes) Clarke - entered the bliss­ful state on the 5th of January this year and became an M. D. in March. He's now in­terning in St. Louis. 
"Here in Rochester we are looking forward to the local football season almost as much as to the'ND schedule. Harry Wright will coach the local Catholic high school. 
"It was with much regret that I passed up attendance at the general reunion. There are many old faces I would like to see again. I'm wondering about such men as Frmiak. Garibaldi* Ijeo Ijudie, Bay Tolson, Dick SolllTan, Dan Bonrkcv Bad Ahem, John McSweeoey and others. But the Army still has some control over my wanderings. I liope this fall will find an impromptu reunion at a football game. Many of the men I have mentioned have been 

, known to me only by letter since October of 1943. It's been too long!" 
Many thanks to Paul for his long letter. We'll expect to see him at the Southern Cal game, or sooner. Now back to some of the shorter, but none the less welcome, works that have come in over the June-July month-end. 
From Gordon Forester, at Great Lakes: 
"As you see by the letterhead me status Is still Navy, but it is voluntary and not required service. I extended to aid in separating enlisted men and also to keep me busy during the sum­mer. Another classmate. Paal Heimann, has done the same thing and is occupied In a near­by building. Whether we are the class of '44 or '45 is a problem. Both of us were in the ROTC and as freshmen were classed '45. How­ever, we got the rush act after that and wound up receiving a degree of sorts in June of '44. 
"Many of the class have been through here for discharge In the last month, including Walter I^^er^e. T. T. Reybom, John McCarty, William Madden, Charies Montrie, and Bob Bhode. 
"On the 15th of June I joined the married ranks, with an almost perfect Notre Dame assist being given by diaries Seffheis and Montrie of our class and Al Salvi of the class following. Only my brother was not of the ranks. Ann Holinger' was my wife's name." 
From Mike Fessemier: 
"At the moment I'm up to my neck trying to learn my father's business, and this fall I'm going back to get my master's in retailing at New York University. 
"Jerry Skofrunick passed through here on his way to Japan and we had a couple of fine- days togetlier seeing the Seattle rain through a cock­tail lounge window. He has been in Tokyo and I've had three letters from him so far. He has a good job in GHQ, but will be glad to get on his way home the end of July. I hope to see him again then. I saw Bob Heagher at an Alumni Association meeting in Seattle not long ago. He tells me that Ed is back at ND finish­ing up and doing well for himself. I received a wedding announcement from Chuck TTrmrla not so long ago. and I believe Til drop him a line tonight. Ted Cummings is married, but I haven't gotten around to dropping In on him yet, I'm living In Tacoma now and Just get to Seattle now and then. John Honda is in Japan doing counter-intelligence work, but I haven't heard from him in a couple of months. He Is married and has a couple of cute children." 

From Fkank Vignola: 
"Since donning civvies late In May, and still without the likes of what might be classified as a reputable dress suit. I've taken to the aspects of a dignified business man, in partnership with another ex-GI, in the manufacture of fountain and cordial extracts. We have a swell little plant going, and someday we hope to start making money. 
"Still my best pal Is the mighty Stratte P. Coorlas, my erstwhile ND roomie for ten years. He's doing well for himself, too, especially when his pretty little wife, Helen, spreads a Greek dinner before his rapidly expanding girth. He's as wide as he is tall now. The Greek and I have begun a Retailer's Protective Agency— Coorlas and Vignola—which we pull on every old NDer we meet who asks us what we are doing in the line of business. And to keep those Ma Vignola spaghetti dinners trom becoming table muscles. I've been playing night soft­ball a few times weekly. 
"I'm. having a big reunion party here in River Forest In the near future, and if you're able to drop down that particular week-end. let me know. Think it will be the third week in August. 
From Bob ReUly» aboard the USS Oregon City at the Philadelphia Naval Base: 
"I've been in the service since leaving school: the Navy Sup.ily Corps, no less. Hit the Pa­cific after it was just about over, on a *tin can,* put that ship out of commission in April of this year, and am now a so-called 'big gun* aboard tlil:s newly commlss'oned Braid-bucket. I agreed to lose the Navy's money and supplies till September, at which time I am In high hopes of getting into Law School. Which 'university Is still undetermined, but you can bet I'm bcav­ering at several gates. 
"Was glad to learn that Gene Slevin was back at school, and hope- to get a letter off to him any day now. Tlie lad I would really like to know something about is John Van Benten. You liaven't heard whether he is still setting the world straight or not, have you?'* 
The last of the letters and post-cards is now in sight. We have a note from John Beycrle, written at Notre Dame, June 14: 
**Harry Yeates was down a week ago. Tom O'Connor, George Barisciilo and I spent Satur­day evening with him in the Hoffmann. Lyie Joyce and Jim Malone were down with Kelly Cook having a few at the bar. Mobs of others have been down in the past few weeks . -. Howard Hall had a banquet last Wednesday at the IJO. Salle. Joe O'Reilly and Joe IKIIon stole the show along with Ziggy CzarobskL Frank SmUh introduced Mox Rogers as—'this is what they look like after four years'." 
From Wilton, Conn.. Leo Rumely sends a 
plea: "Returning to school this fall, but can't 
locate a place to live. If you have any ideas 
for an abode for the wife and me, write post 
haste." Leo was at school June 28, but couldn't 
stay for the rest of the reunion days. 
E, W. O'Reilly of Fort Wayne. Ind., writes 
that Ttom O'Reilly is still in service, and, as of 
June 21 was in Rome, but hoping to get home 
in time for the fall games. 
And E. J. Bajorek, Tltusvliie, Pa., writes that 
Matthew Bajorek, originally '45, is with the 
C3rd Infantry in Korea. He was recently 
awarded the Army Commendation Ribbon for 
occupation work with the 6th Division. 
By way of mall we have heard that Harry 
XcGce is living in Detroit now, Vrsuik Carver is doing dairy work at Altona, N. T., Jolm J> Aiufavs is hard at work in New York City. 
And that clears the mall, except for three letters from men who, by reason of the war and the ravages of time, have been Included in the Alumni file of '44. Their letters empha­size tlie present situation many men find them­selves in—just what class do they belong to. 
John Griffln of Chicago says: "My class was originally 1942, though any class from Notre Dame would be a good class." 
Bill Krapf of Merr<ck, N. Y. says: "Originally I was to graduate In the class of 1942; but due to a prolonged illness did not complete my college courses until 1944." 
And Bill Carrico of Center\-ille, Mich., hits the jackpot with his explanation: "I was originally of the class of 1943. But I completed my course in 1942, and didn't finish my thesis until 1944. Therefore my graduation is dated 1944." 
All this adds up to the fact that something must be done to correct the class year standings of many grads and ex's. This fall, then, an effort will be made to straighten out the mat­ter. Any suggestions, criticisms, complaints, donations or what have you will be welcomed. 
Next on the agenda is the Fourth Annual Alumni Fund. As we said a few columns of type back, the class of *44 Is leading the pack with their returns. With the help of Jim. Arm­strong in the front oifice. your secretary sent out 471 letters to men of '44. Apparently we have stolen a few men from other classes, but that will be rectified. But more apparent Is the absence of many names that sliould be on the list. If you didn't get one of the 471 letters, or you know of someone who didn't and should have, please let us know. The organization needs you. every one. 
Next, tlie reunion, so-called. There was noth­ing formal, but many sessions were held In the Oaf, • the Hoffmann. Sweeney's. Dillon Hall. Howard Hall, the Lido, the bus stop and where have you. There was a Memorial Mass Satur­day morning, the Alumni Banquet Saturday evening, and Sunday Mass on the near-formal side. 
Going down the list, and hoping not to miss 
anyone, there were:. 
Jim Constantin and Mike Kiely, both with less than two weeks in the States, both in uniform but discharged, and Jim with a cookie duster reared in Germany; Bob Martina, with a stripe and a half on his blues and a re-enllstment for a year in his pocket; BUI O'Connor and Jim Borke down from New York way; John Cow­ley all the way from Spokane, Wash., where he's convalescing at the Ft. George Wright Hospital; Bill 'Red* Johnston up from New Orleans, with .the suggestion that we have a reunion at the Tulane game; Jack Segerson, Jim Piatt, Jack Thornton and Jack Coaker, driving up Saturday from Chicago, and the last two with their wives; Jim Meagher, who put through a phono call in time to have Dick D»ermer arrive for the Saturday night session at the Hoffmann; Tom Bremer, ragged at the edges after three days struggling with the bar exam in Cleveland; Herb Clark and Bill Sny­der heading another Chicago delegation; Joe neweger enjoying the elevation of the HofC­mann's high stools; John Morris and Dave Bcney driving In from Detroit; and Ben Mam­mina. Ban Tomcik, Ed Sachal^ki, Vlnce Mell, Ed Kavanaugh, Jim Clarke, Gene Moore and J!m Sallh'cn around and about. 
Other '44 men on and off the campus were Jack Dougherty, doing grad work, John Bey­erle, prefecting in Howard. Chuck Patterson, Bcb MacDonnell, liarry Goebeler, Jack Whitdy, Joe Cheney, Gene Trinkley, Duke tcwy , Ed Conger and Joe Pons. 
Among the "44 men who graduated the hard 
way this year are: Joe Rud, who gave the class 
oration, Ed Meagher, valedictorian, Mike Craw­

On the Instigation of the Chicago delegation, we are preparing for a '44 reunion Nov. 30. Remember the date. Southern Cal will be around for Saturday afternoon's fun, and we will try to have something arranged for Sat­urday evening. There is also talk of an informal reunion after the Army game, Nov. 9. That, however, will have to be arranged from the New York end. Ticket sales opened Aug. 1. 
And that is all. If you're '44, remember the gang with a letter. 
O June 4, ex-Lt. (j. g.) John T. Whltely, of White Plains, N. Y., was presented the Silver Star for gallantry In action at the time of the Okinawa assault. John had been discharged on March 16. and was finishing his chemical en­gineering course at Notre Dame at the time of the award, which was made on the cam­pus before the drawn-up ranlcs of the Notre Dame NR6TC. 
Frank Tlcnola was discharged from the serv­ice in May and plans to return to Law School at Notre Dame In the fall.

The 9th Annual 
Universal Communion Sunday 
DECEMBER 8 — A CHANCE TO BE BIG 
Sunday, December eighth, is the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. 
Sunday, December eighth, is the 9th Annual Universal .Communion Sunday of the Local Alumni Clubs. 
Sunday, December eighth, is the centennial feast of Mary as Patroness of the United States of America. 
The combination of circumstances creates a challenge to Notre Dame alumni, individually and in the Clubs. 
The combination is a perfect peg on which to hang the crystallization of the Committee (or Commitees] on Religion and Citizen­ship in every Club.
