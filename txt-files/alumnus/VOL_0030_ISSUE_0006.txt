Dec. 4, 1952 

I would like with this letter to further acquaint you with the selection of the members of the Board of Directors of your Alumni Association. As you are aware the Board is composed of 12 Directors. Each year in the Fall four new members are elected and are seated at the January meeting of the Board. With the seating of the four new members the four members who were elected three years previously retire from the Board. 
With regard to the selection of the new members, early each year the Club Presidents all over the country are asked to nominate outstanding Alumni. The names of those nominated by the Club Presidents are in turn furnished to a nominating committee composed of members of the Board of Directors. This committee after careful consultation selects eight candidates. Among factors considered in this selection, are geographical distribution of, and participation in Alumni activities of the candidates. 
The slate of eight candidates are presented to the membership of the Notre Dame Alumni Association for a vote in the late Fall, as you ore aware, the ballots already being in your hands. Inasmuch as the Board of Directors speaks for your Association and for you in Alumni matters I urge you to give careful consideration to this slate in order that the vote may be most representative. 
Sincerely,

Fisher Hall Dedicated Nov. 29 
ELMORE G. SMITH 

Recreation Center Bequest Left by Grad Killed in Korea 
A 23-year-old Marine lieutentant killed in action in Korea, has left a por­tion of his estate to the school he loved. The bequest of Lieutenant Elmore Charles Smith, a 1950 Notre Dame graduate from Bronxville, New York, will be used to help establish a new stu­dent recreation center on the campus of his alma mater. 
In a letter advising the University of his son's $1,115 bequest, Mr. V. Weav­er Smith wrote: "Notre Dame had a great deal to do with the wonderful life that Elmore had. Both Mrs. Smith and I are very happy that he was thought­ful enough to show his appreciation to Notre Dame in this way." 
Lieutenant Smith was the third of four Notre Dame graduates who have been killed in Korea. He was commis­sioned a second lieutenant in the Ma­rine Corps Resereve upon graduation from Notre Dame in 1950. Smith was called to active duty the following Oc­tober at Quantico, Virginia, and join­ed the Second Marine Division at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, a few months later. While at Camp Le­jeune, according to Marine Corps Headquarters' records, he requested a combat assignment. His request was granted, and he was assigned to the First Marine Division for duty in Ko­rea. 
Lieutenant Smith died on September 16, 1951, after only t\vo days in action at Songae-Dong on the' Central Ko­rean front. He was buried in the mil­Fisher Hall, the newest of fourteen 
student residence buildings on the No­tre Dame campus, was formally dedi­cated November 29, at ceremonies con­ducted by the Rev. Theodore M. Hes-burgh, C.S.C., President of the Uni­versity. The $750,000 building, which is a tasteful combination of modern . functional architecture and collegiate Gothic, is a gift of the late Mrs. Fred 
J. Fisher in memory of her husband, co-founder and first president of the Fisher Body Company, Detroit. 
In the chapel of the hall which bears their name. Father Hesburgh offered a Solemn Requiem Mass for Mr. and Mrs. Fisher who had long been friends of Notre Dame. Fisher, one of the pio­neers of America's great auto industry, served as a member of the University's Associate Board of Lay Trustees for more than twenty years until his death in 1941. 
Following the Mass, Miss Anne Markley, a niece of Mr. and Mrs. Fish­er, formally presented the building to the University. Father Hesburgh and Thomas Reedy, president of the Stu­dent Senate, responded with brief talks of acceptance and appreciation. The ceremonies closed with the unveiling of a memorial plaque in the lobby of the hall and the blessing of the build­ing. 
Designed by Holabird, Root aind Burgee of Chicago, and built by Peter Schumacher and Sons, MishawaJia, In­diana, Fisher Hall provides attractive campus living accommodations for 150 Notre Dame students. A chapel, which is a center of spiritual life in each of Notre Dame's residence halls, is strik­ingly done in modem liturgical simpli­city. Students may receive visitors in the glass enclosed reception room adjacent to the lobby. 
Fisher Hall is only one of three ma­jor gifts presented to Notre Dame by the Fisher family. In 1949 Mrs. Fisfao­provided $250,000 to be used as a re­volving cash fund for the purjiose of making loans to Notre Dame students who were working their way through school. At that time, Mrs. Fisher ex­pressed a conviction, which she shared with her husband, that the young peo­ple of America need "more opportun­ities and fewer subsidies" if we are to adhere to the principles upon which our country was founded. 
In 1951, Mrs. Fisher presented sev­enteen rare paintings and three tapes­tries to Notre. Dame's Wightman Art Gallery. Included were masterpieces by Bartolomeo Veneto, Antonio Pollaiu­olo, George Romney and Francois Boucher.

not resented and made the signal foi" 
(Note: The occasional appearance of these comments will not bring you ac­tual editorials, or official pronounce­ments on great issues. But it seems to me that from time to time we happen upon many things that do not lend themselves to story treatment, things that should not be lost in Club or Class columns, but things of general alumni interest and appeal. It is ujwn these things that I should like to make occasional comment.—J.E.A.) 
ADDRESSES OF FATHER JOHN W. CAVANAUGH 
Alumni of the forty years between 1890 and 1935 will welcome, with their own personal embellishments, the collection of the sermons and addresses of the late Rev. John AV. Cavanaugh, C.S.C., president of Notre Dame from 1905 to 1919, edited by Rev. John A. O'Brien, with a biographical preface under the familiar title, "The Con­quest of Life." Father Cavanaugh's eloquence and personality brought Notre Dame, ahead of its time, to a position of pre-eminence among the Catholic institutions of higher learn­ing. Had his prime coincided with the microphone and the television camera, speculation is pressed to measure his impact. 

THINGS ARE LOOKING 'U?' 
Here's just a little group of facts, gleaned from our last Alumni Board meeting (Nov. 7-8-9), which brings home the point that we have grown, both extensively and intensively. Some­times I wonder (as you may) what keeps me busy. We tend to take too many revolutionarj' changes for grant­ed. 
For example, in 1952 we have almost twice as many alumni as we had in 1942 —and that doesn't seem verj' long ago. does it? 
We have 124 Local Alumni Clubs, as against only 68 in 1932. And the Clubs are more active. Whereas, in 1932, 27 Clubs reported Universal Notre Dame Night meetings in the fol­lowing ALUMNUS, in 1952 we had 75 Clubs reporting. 
And many Clubs are having many meetings within the year, weekly lunch­eons, and a wide variety of events rang­ing from Cana Conferences to theatre parties and football trips. 
The Class Notes, which in 1932 were 

filling 5 pages in the ALUMNUS, 
from 10 Class Secretaries, now, in 1952, 
arc filling 17 pages, from 26 Secretar­
ies. 
And in 1941, we struggled valiantly to get $5 annual dues from 2,500 mem­bers of the Atsociation to raise some $12,500. As of October, 1952, wilhoul counting a half million dollar gift from an honorary' alumnus, the 10th Annual Alumni Fund lists $199,101.26 from 5,367 alunmi contributions, and $160,­
565.92 from 1,029 non-alumni friends, many of them secured through the activity of alumni in the Notre Dame Foundation. 
Hang on—it's only the beginning! 


WE'RE DOIN' OUR BEST 
There are three great areas of po­tential imhappiness in the modern American campus possessed of the com­mon denominators of character, fixed capacity and athletics. These areas are (1) discipline (2) enrollment and 
(3) tickets. 1 would just like to call to your at­tention, whether you are alumni of the 50-Year Club or alumni of the '50, '51 or '52 Classes, that in the light of vol­ume, and analysis of activities, the present policies that prevail in (a) the administration of student welfare (b) the admission of students and (c) the distribution of tickets, obviously and primarily football, are neither perfect in conception nor flawless in a\ecution. But they are the careful evolution of more than 100 years experience in ad­mission and discipline, and more than 65 years experience in the vagaries of intercollegiate athletic competition. I call this to your attention, because whereas you can probably cite case his­tories of mutual regret, the basic ad­ministration is by men of good will, and the net results have kept Notre Dame 
in an enviable position in all three areas. 

HOW ABOUT YOU? 
In an era of tensions, it seems to me we frequently tend to identify things by their tensions, frequently losing their true perspectives and doing irreparable damage. 
For example, the Local Alumni Clubs and the campus Geographical Clubs have much in common, and much to gain from close cooperation. If the initiative on either side is slow in forth­another iron curtain. 
Or, when Notre Dame captures the public eye with something of national significance which may not meet with your personal views, do you consistent­ly temper your reaction that the place is going to hell with the more construc­tive thought that if Notre Dame had 
•not advanced (and with it you, as an alumnus) in age, wisdom and stature, it would not command cither the ac­tion or the reaction?

sary of Pearl Harbor," Armstrong add­
ed, "and alumni every^vhere were es­
pecially mindful of the 334 Notre 
Dame men who gave their lives in 
World War II, and the four alumni

First in Medical History 
Doctor Charles A. Hufnagel, an emi­nent heart siugeon and 1937 Notre Dame graduate, has for the first time in medical history successfully fitted a patient with an artificial aortic valve. 
According to a story in a recent TIME magazine, the pioneering surg­ery performed by Dr. Hufnagel and his associates transformed a desperately ill yoimg woman into a vigorous hopeful person free from the anginal pain she had suffered for months. 
Rheumatic fever, which Doctor Huf­nagel's patient had contracted years ago, had damaged her heart's aortic valve. 
According to Dr. Hufnagel there are thousands of cases of aorta damage in the United States each year. Doctor Hufnagel is hopeful that this new op­eration will help many of them. 
Dr. Hufnagel, who now resides in Falb Church, Virginia, is a native of Richmond, Indiana. A former instruc­tor in surgery at the Harvard Medic<d School, he now is professor of surgical research at the Georgetown University Medical School. Dr. Hufnagel was honored as one of the nation's ten outstanding young men of 1948 by the United States Junior Chamber of Commerce.

University Transforming Old Science Building Info Campus Recreofion Cenfer for Students 
Notre Dame will soon have a new recreation center to facilitate increasing student activities when the old Science Building on the campus is finally re­constructed and redecorated for use early next semester,, according to Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C., presi­dent of the Universit)'. 
Reconstruction work \nl\ begin as soon as moving crews have finished transferring the department's scientific laboratory apparati, and the fossils, old books, and other accruements of the science museum to the new Nieuwland Science Center. 
Facilities to be incorporated in the planning of the building include ad­ministrative offices to be used by ex­ecutives of the University, and a series of group participation rooms, while the basement of the building will be oc­cupied by the Geology Department. 
Provisions are being made for offices for the Vice President in Charge of Student Affairs, a secretary's room and ante-room: a conference room, which will contain a conference table and seating capacity of 12; a Student Sen­ate office; building manager's space; a Blue Circle Honorarj' Society office; and Graduate School, NFCCS, and YCS accommodations. 
The group participation area will house a film projection room, in which accommodations for television presen­tation is also included; a game room; a music library and listening room sim­ilar to that in the Harvard University Library; and a room insulated with acoustic tile for use of the debate team and other lecturers. Two ciub meeting rooms, which will have a seating ca­pacity of 50 students, and t\vo other 30-seat chambers will be prepared out of the old classrooms on the second and third floors. 
Main feature of the general rooms will be the lounge area, which was for­merly occupied by the Science Mus­eum. It will serve as a lobby, sufficient in size to accommodate 100 couples and orchestra space. Television will be set up in the lounge area also, with furniture grouping to permit a small viewing audience. Supplement­ar\' lounge areas will be provided for smaller groups and smaller dances, pos­sibly on the balcony level. A special room is also being designed for photo­graphic supplies and developing equip­ment. 

A bookstore, for books of hterary and supplementary interest, a reading room adjacent to the bookstore, and a coffee bar and kitchen are also being planned for the new recreation center. 
Facilities to be constructed are left up to the students working through the Student Senate and the Hall Council System. 
The Department of Architecture is handling the designing problem, and has already inaugurated a design con­test wherein students of that depart­ment are competing for prizes of $50, $35, and $15 respectively. Layouts are to be in accordance with the Univer­sity's allotted budget. The administra­tion then reserves the right to incor­porate the better features of all three prize-winning designs, as well as those suggested by other students, into the final plans.

O. A. Shaughnessy, who 

tributed more than $700,000 to their alma mater during 1952, it was an­nounced recently at the Fall meeting of the directors of the University's national Aliunni Association on the campus. Harvey Foster of El Paso, Texas, alumni president, revealed that 3,367 graduates had . contributed a total of $699,101.26 to the University thus far this year. The total amount which includes one large capital gift, is slightly greater than the total of alimmi contributio'ns on the same date a year ago, Foster said. All alumni are urged to participate in the Alumni Fund regardless of amount they give. 
"Almnni of Notre Dame continue to respond magnificently to the needs of the University," Foster declared. "Without the generosity of Notre Dame's alumni and friends, the Uni­versity's progress could not be main­tained. The tuition of its 5,100 stud­ents does not begin to meet the Uni­versity's $10,000,000 annual buget, let alone provide for future expansion," Foster added. 
The Alimini Board of Directors also reviewed the progress of Notre Dame aliunni clubs from coast-to-coast. James 
E. Armstrong, executive secretary of the Alumni Association, reftorted that Notre Dame's 124 almnni clubs "have nearly doubled in number since 1932 and thir­ty new clubs have been activated in the past ten years." 
William R. Dooley, placement di­rector at Notre Dame, reported to the alumni directors that the number of employers interviewing students on the campus is 50 per cent greater this year. Some 183 business and industrial or­ganizations regularly send representa­tives to the campus to conduct student interviews, Dooley said. The Alumni Board also heard committee reports on enrollment, job coiuiseling and citi­zenship. It also reviewed the opera­tion of "The Alumnus" whose columns are filled with news of Notre Dame's 22,000 graduates. The Board recom­mended that the fifty class secretaries be convened on the campus for their second meeting in June, 1953. 
The Alumni Board of Directors will meet again in January.

FOOTBALL IN REVIEW — 1952 
the current edition of Fighting Irish 
By BILL LONDO, '53 
basketball wU at least match the 16 
Winning seven against some of the strongest foes in the nation, losing tivo and tieing one, establishes this year's Notre Dame eleven as the "upset team" of 1952—and one of the great­est and garhest squads ever to wear the blue and gold. 
Opening with tivo rugged foes, Penn­sylvania and Texas, Notre Dame managed to come through with one victory and one tie. The deadlock started the year .in Philadelphia's Franklin Field where over 74,000 spec­tators watched Penn score a lightning­like 65-yard aerial TD to match Notre Dame's first period 89-yard scoring march. For the most part, it was a de­fensive battle. 
The ne-vt week in Austin, Texas, the Irish pulled the first of their '52 upsets by downing the Texas Longhoms with a whirlwind second half rally, 14-3. Notre Dame trailed 3-0 at half time and had not ventured into Texan territory during the first 30 minutes. 
Pittsburgh ruined the home opening and any hopes for an unblemished rec­ord when the Panthers edged to a 22­19 win the following Saturday. Irish halfback Joe Heap electrified the crowd with a 92-yard punt return for a touch­down, but the glory went to Pitt, led by halfback Bill Reynolds, as they scored their first victory over the Irish since 1937. 
Notre Dame then won four games in a row, the last being the heart-tingling 27-21 upset of Oklahoma. Purdue fell 26-14 in a battle of fumbles. North Carolina was beaten for the first home win of the season, 34-14, and Navj' was defeated in Cleveland 17-7. Then came the Oklahoma contest. 
The game with Oklahoma was one of the greatest ever seen in the Notre Dame stadium. The Irish matched the Sooner's Billy Vessels, touchdown for touchdown, and then scored one of their own to win the nationally tele­vised contest. Vessels scored all three Oklahoma TD's on long runs, but it was a smashing tackle by ND lineback­er Dan Shannon that was the play of the day. Shannon roared into Sooner halfback Larry Grigg on the kickoff 
following the third Irish touchdown. 
with a tackle that jarred the ball from 
his grasp to be recovered by Notre 
Dame and set up the winning score. 
Michigan State ended the Notre 

Dame streak, won their 23rd consecu­
tive game, and probably clinched the 
national championship by beating the 
Irish 21-3 the next week. Fumbles again 
played a major part in the game. The 
Spartans recovered all seven of Notre 
Dame's bobbles, t\vo of them setting 
up TD's, while the lone Irish field goal 
came after a recovery in the third per­
iod. Despite defeat, however, the de­
fensive play of the underdog Notre 
Dame was a truly marvelous perform­
ance. 
Iowa was defeated 27-0 on their home field. The Irish, playing with­out the services of Coach Frank Leahy, who was ill, came through in compara­tively easy fashion. 
One of the biggests upsets of the year was the defeat of Southern Cali­fornia, 9-0, in the season's finale in the Notre Dame Stadium. The Tro­jans, bidding for a No. 1 national rat­ing, were undefeated and untied and had been selected to represent the West in the Rose Bowl classic. 
DON PENZA ELECTED 1953 IRISH FOOTBAU CAPTAIN 
Donald Francis Penza, end, was elected captain of the 1953 Fighting Irish football team. Don is from Ken­osha, Wise, and played for St Cath­erine's High School in Racine. He has been outstanding in the ND line and 
is a worthy successor to Jack Alessan­drini, '52 leader. 
won, 10 lost record of last year's squad which was riddled by both ineligibles and injuries. 
On the brighter side, there is the fact that four of the leading scorers from a year ago do return. Heading the list is Captain Norbert (Gooch) Lewinski, senior center, who tallied 213 points last winter. Others, and their point totals are: Dick Rosenthal, jun­ior center-forward, 329; Joe Bertrand. junior forward, 293, and Jerry Mc-Closkey, senior guard, 139. Bertrand broke his hand in a brief fling at foot­ball and may not be in top shape for the opener with' Creighton, at home, Dec. 3. Jack Stephens, speedy sopho­more guard, was also out for football and has not been able to practice full time wth the cage squad. Jim Gibbons, 
senior guard who is an excellent play-maker, is another returning monogram ^^dnner. Johnny Lattner, star football halfback, wTio played in the final four games a year ago, was expected to join the squad at the conclusion of the grid­iron campaign.

Aurora 

The general membership meeting of the Notre Dame Club of Aurora was held at the K. of C. Hall on the 17th of July. After the customary preliminary bull session, the meeting was called to order. A motion was made, upon the recommen­dation of WILUAM CHAWGO, '31, to send $500 to the Notre Dame Alumni Association this year to be held In trust by the University until which time the Aurora Club designates its proper use. The board of trustees elected to follow this mo­tion and ordered the treasurer to send a check to the University. The University is encouraging Its many alumni clubs to follow this procedure in order that It may gain the Interest on the several hundred thousand dollars donated to it. 
Upon the reading of the treasurer's report, we found that we were still very sol\*ent.

The rafHc raised approximately $500.00.

An event of more than social import was held 

September 9 — the annual Freshman Reception 
tendered by the club to ingoing first-year men. 
Here's a report by the chairman, RAY DURST: 
*'An unusually interesting program and a new 

high in attendance, plus the unforeseen but happv 
presence of REVEREND THEODORE M. HES­
BURGH, C.S.C., new president of the Universit>-, 
marked the Notre Dame Club of Chicago's Annual 
Freshman Reception. 
'*The event was chairmanncd bv RfWMOND 

W. DURST, '26, assisted by VERNE KELLEY, *50. Locale of the reception was tlie Crystal Ball­room of the Chicago Athletic Association on the evening of September 9, 1952. RE\^REND LOUIS J. THORNTON, C.S.C., Director of Ad­missions, introduced by Co-Chairman Verne Kclle\-, gave the principal address and represented the University. His presentation highlighted the Uni-versit>'*s aims in education and gave the incoming students a keen insight of the educational and spiritual atmosphere into which they were moving. PAUL E. KAMSCHULTE, JR., Waukegan, an incoming freshman, set forth his reasons for select­ing the University as his Alma Mater; RICHARD BEEMAN, River Forest, Illinois, Sophomore, in­terestingly told his experiences as a freshman; JOSEPH R. MARTIN, '23, inspiringly related how his education and spiritual enrichment at the University assisted him in his post-campus vears. JOSEPH PAGLIARI, '53, President of the'Chi­cago Notre Dame Club, the campus organization, explained the actiWties of his group and ilic bene­fits which a membership affords to the student. 
"In addition, two 10-minutc movies depicting campus activities were shown. 
**By reason of his presence in the dty to attend a luncheon given in his honor by the Union League Club at noon on the same day. Reverend Tlieodore AL Hesburgh, C.S.C., President of the University, introduced by LUKE TIERNAN, Pres­ident of the club, graciously stayed over for our event and made a very fine and much appreciated talk. This was a real surprise and afforded the new students and their fathers the pleasant oppor­tunity of making his acquaintance. 
**The e\-ent was concluded with coffee and doughnuts and a good "rag chew." Approximately 330 were in attendance. All guests were presented by the Club with a set of 50 bookplates imprinted v/ith their names. The Governors and Officers of the Club attended as hosts to the guests and contributed a great deal by introducing guests to each other, ready identification being created by 
name badges for incoming student guests and 
Officer and Governor hosts, and imparting infor­
mation concerning the Universit>' to the new 
students." 
The appearance of Father Hesburgh at the 

Union League club, mentioned in the last para­
graph of Ray's report, was a marked success. 
Club members were heard to comment that the 
luncheon was better attended than any similar 
event in a long time. Father Hesburgh's talk 
was well received by the audience.

A visit to Texas by a Notre Dame football team is pretty rare, and tlms we took tlic recent encounter with Texas on Oct. 4 as an excuse to "whoop" it up a bit. The week preceding the game we held a . Joint lundieon with the Texas alumni, with pre-gamc ribbing coming from both sides. Of course Notre Dame being a touclidown underdog, we did more ribbing the week after tlian we dared to the week before. The club also sponsored a number of chartered busses to Austin for the game. They ^vcre open to all interested and tlie results were successful, as it afforded us an opportunity to increase our small treasury. A local travel agency handled all the details on a profit-sharing basis, as we had to utilize their experience and office accommodations. 
We are now drawing up a plan to notify our 

members of events to come for the next sue 
months, such as a communion breakfast, luncheon, 
etc This is so that each may lay his plans 
accordingly, and we hope it will make for better 
attendance.

Because of our geographic problem here in Idaho, club President PAUL KOHOUT, '25, has recommended that a separate club be organized in Idaho Falls, and that alumni living from Lewiston north belong to tlie Spokane club. The Boise group of which he is head can draw the members from the Southcentral, and Southwestern parts of Idaho and Eastern Oregon. Paul believes that this breakdown will give all alumni in the area a better opportunity for participation in club activities. 
Our Friday luncheon meetings continue at the Mode Ltd., and all Notre Dame men travelling through tliis area are welcome to attend.

1) In the spiritual way (FATHER O'HARA and helpers like FATHER DOREMUS and FA­THER STEINER saw to that). 
2) In the intellectual ^ray (Conscientious profs ditto). , 
3) In a social way (Not the dances and s-uff that came near the end of our sojourn there; I mean the "gcm"tl'**^=^^" ***^' accompanied walks and talks on a Saturday afternoon when you didn't have enough for an S.B. movie . . . and the borrowing of enough so that you could smoke a pipeful . . . wondering if youM ever have a monogrammcd one like those rich folks in Walsli . . . and we*d walk the 3-1 tracks and the St. Joe River banks and were THOSE the afternoons . . . tlicn we*d talk about our weekend assign­ments in English and Accounting and other things and get set to get back to our "barracks," clean up a bit, eat . . . either at the old dining room, at the Greek's or at Kable*s . . . and ohhhh, ihc treat >vhcn wc got down and could, for thirtyfive­ccntsbelieveitomotlrcmembcr . . . have a sirloin plate wth American fries, etc . . . and then, of course, there was always the GLAMOUR of hav­ing Friday night supper in tl»e Oliver Cafe. Re­member the fillet of sole and then the potatoes, mashed, and the way they poured some butter over them, and the abundance of sauce? Ahhhhh, who says anything about the WhifTenpoofs and their song? WE know it, too. And, I think. much more . . . and couldn't I be soo wrong! Than the kids of today who arc too many, don't know one another, evcr>-one, like wc did . , . but . . . life goes on.)" 
Men of '22 who scanned the obituary column of the last ALUMNUS must Iiave been severely jolted when thcv read the very sad news of tlic passing of CHARLES HIRSCHBUHL of Portland, Oregon, who died July 28 after being confined to bed by a 10-month illness. Tlic nc^vs was received just as the ALUMNUS was going to press, and consequently no comment \*"as made other tlian the bare announcement of Charlie's death. It is no exaggeration to say that many of our classmates believe tlicy have lost their finest friend. A person just couldn't know Charlie Hirschbuhl and not love him. For he was our idea of the ver>' finest in Catholic man­hood—a wonderful credit to his family, his Church and his sdiool. Charlie was intensely loyal to all of these, and extremely proud of them. In the Class of 1922, nobody can take Charlie*s place. Our sympathy and prayers to the wdow—^Mrs. Pat Hirschbuhl; to a sister, Kathcrine Hirschbuhl; two daughters, Mrs. Don­ald Drake of Portland, and Mrs. Bradley Quinn of Fresno, California. 
Our good friend, Charlie Hirschbuhl, was presi­dent of the Monarch Forge and Machine Works of Portland, and prominent in industrial, social and educational circles in his hometown of Port­land. In recent years he scr\*ed as a member of tlic Associate Board of Lay Trustees of the University of Portland, operated by the Holy Cross Order. 
We tender our special s\TnpatIiy to BILL SCHMITT, '10, of Portland. Bill was an in­separable friend of Charlie's. Afany expressions of sorrow were received from Charlie's classmates. Here are a few: 
"I ara certainly grieved to learn about Charlie Hirschbuhl's death. He was one of the grandest fellows I ever knew."—JACK HUETHER. 

**Hc vrzs a fine friend both of us, of our class' and to Notre Dame."—JOHN PAUL CULLEN. 
"About Charlie: when I look dou-n the list of our deceased of *22, I think of the warm ones . . . I mean the ones who were alwa>'s ready with time, money, cflTort and knowbo^^^ for an\-thing that was for the good of ND or our class and its prestige .. . and I know that Charlie stands out as one of the most generous of us all!

may Our Good Lord reward all of his selfless­ness . . . which, after all, is one of the tilings that pays off the most after death."—FATHER GEORGE FISCHER, CS.C. 
Wc are very happy that Charlie was elected an honorary president of '22 by his classmates attend­ing our reunion last June. Also, it pleased Charlie greatly when several classmates talked with him by telephone from Diamond Lake. 
We still do not understand how the name of HE.\RTLEY "HUNK" ANDERSON was omitted from the list of those attending our reunion. Htrnk was very much present, and his presence was very much appreciated and enjoyed by his classmates. Hunk and CHET AVYNNE are the most loyal athletic members of '22. We do not recall their ever missing a reunion of our class.

Dr. DAVE MURPHY, of Dixon, 111., died last month . . . the 27tli of our class to go to his reward. HANK WURZER was sorry Dave's name could not be included on the list of deceased members of the class but the cards liad been printed when wc heard of Dave's death. Please include Dave in your prayers. Dave ^vas most generous and enthusiastic about our Mass Fund and in sending in his donation recently, said it was an idea that must be carried on. I distinctly remember that he was very generous and co­oiKrative at the time of our 23th reunion. Let us be generous in our prayers for him and his grand family. Dave just entered his son at Notre Dame this year. Mrs. Murphy wishes to thank the Class for tlie Mass ^vhich ^\-as said by FATHER TOM McAVOY. Father Tom is abo saying two Masses for the entire class during November. Remember to offer your Communion the first Sunday in November for our class­mates and remember them in your prayers during tlie entire month of November. 
In case you forgot to remember our Mass Fund, send a dollar or so to our treasurer, HANK ^VURZER, 307 Raid Bldg., Davenport, Iowa. (Wasn't that a beautiful card that Hank mailed the entire class?) Let*s keep it in our prayer book or missal and remember the boys who used to pray with us back in old Sorin Chapel. 
The only new news of our classmates came from JOHN J. RYAN. John sent mc a news clipping, a very thoughtful Secretary of the Class of 1926, about AL A. SOMMER. A!, who was vice-presi­dent and manager of the Cleveland office of McCann-Erickson, has been named group-head in the agency's Chicago office. Al joined McCann-Erickson Co. in 1934. Al—let's hear the details of ycm and your fine family! 
How about some news from the rest of you 

•25en . . . 
As this letter was ready to go out this morning, I received word from Hank Wurzer that JOHN 0*TOOLE of Pittsburgh, Pa., died Oct. 12, 1951; and BROTHER LAWRENCE JOSEPH also died in October of last year. This information came to Hank in response to his sending out the me-
The Notre Dame Alumnus 

morial cards. Classes will be said for John and Brother Lawrence Joseph. Don*t forget that Mass Nov. 2 and keep praying for the boys.

"Again it is my sad duty to notify our class­mates of the loss of another classmate. Accord­ing to word received in the Alumni Office, FRANK ESCH died at Houston, Texas, on Sep­tember 6, 1932. We have sent his widow the class s>'mpathy and arranged for a Mass for him. 
"By this time you have no doubt received a letter which the Alumni Oflice reproduced and mailed for your Secretary and as you noted most of the information contained in that letter came from BILL DOOLEY. As a matter of fact, some of the dope he sent me was saved over to be used in this column. 
"Bill reports seeing CHARLEY MASON and JOE QUINLAN when they visited the Placement Bureau to recruit for the Indiana Bell Telephone. Bill also reports having bumped into WINK KINGERTER in Washington last spring and learning from Wink of DAN 0*NEILL's marriage. AVink is now located in Washington still with Electric Motor Division of General Motors. On the Washington trip. Bill also saw WALTER TROHAN. 
"Bill, also in his trips around the country, was the principal speaker at Toledo UND night where ART SUDER was toastmostcr. Art is still making Toledo smell pretty with his flowers. In September, Bill had dinner with TED WROCK­LEGE in Cincinnati where Ted is manager of Bulk Sales for Proctor and Gamble and also another of the '26 grandfathers. 
"The next issue of this column I hope will be furnished by someone or many 'someones' with as much information as BILL DOOLEY has sent. Please send the dope to me at the address shown.'' 
A "Bronze Pelican" award was recently given by the Archdiocese of New York to KEN COOK, now Director of Public Relations at St. Louis University. The Most Rev. Joseph E. Rittcr, Archbishop of St. Louis, presented Ken with the award. 
AL KIRK, Director of Catholic Service of tlie Boy Scouts of America, w*a5 honored recently at a dinner in Dubuque, Iowa. The principal address was given by the Most Rev. Henr>- P. Kohlman, Arclibishop of Dubuque.

More than 150 members of the grand old Class of 1928 have already expressed their determina­tion, come Hades or high water, come plenty or penury, to be on hand, alive and kicking, God willing, at our silver anniversary reunion next June 12, 13 and 14 at Univcrsitas Nostrae Do­minae a Lacu. This large number of prospective rcunionists nearly equals the number of Twenty-Eighters who attended our 20th-year rendezvous in 1948. It is safe to say that at least 225 Classmates will rally at ND in *53. 
Our energetic and far-sighted President, LOUIE BUCKLEY, has been flooding the muls for the past several months with pointed, pithy and prodding letters, urging one and all to make our silver anniversary reunion both a memorable and momentous one. All committee members are al­ready bard at work. 
Letters have been coming to me thick and fast not only from bustling "Buck," but also bom-

Our Roving Reporter, AUGUSTUS E. "GU5" JENKINS, sends a most welcome and informa­tive letter: "Perhaps it takes a strong motivating force to stir one to action. As you know our business affairs carry me to mf)st parts of the country in the course of a year. "Last week I had occasion to go to Pittsburgh. So one day we called Mrs. John McMahon and invited her and her family out to dinner. In turn she insisted that we come out to her house in Mt. Lebanon as she wanted to talk. So we went out to her home where we had dinner with  her, her mother, Mrs. Bums, and her two sons,  John and Michael.

 Our unofficial Koving Ambassador, "Gas" JEN­ KINS, who sometimes surprises bis good wife by  hanging his hat in his own home in WUliamsville, 
 N. Y., pens another interesting letter as foUows: 
December, 1952 23 
**This will acknowledge your letter of October 
14th. When I think of you and that young 
family of yours, I fed young, enthusiastic and in­
spired to "stay in there pitcliin'. 
"Regarding the McMahon family, I'm sure 
they will be grateful. All will work out in 
<]uc time. 
"Now to report some of my traveling. At ilie 
moment I am staying overnight at the Soutliern 
Hotel, Baltimore, just having arrived from N. Y. 
and Phila., where I had some business. I had 
thought I might get thru AIlcnto\*-n, but this 
convoy-business takes me to factories around the 
country—N. Tarrytown, Metuchen, Cliffsidc, Lin­
den, Chester, Wilmington, Baltimore. Tomorrow 
I go to Harrisburg, Carlisle, then Buffalo. 
"About three weeks ago I made a trip to St. Louis \'ia Columbus where I saw JOE CAXTY, *28—Law *29. Joe has two small daughters. Joe has i»ad some liard luck too. He %vas married years ago after he left scliool. His first wife died suddenly six weeks after their marriage. However, Joe is doing well in Columbus. He told me our old friend JIM SHOCKNESSV, '28, is Gov. Lauschc's right arm. Jim has proved an able lauycr and a good politician. Joe sa>-s ihe Cannon brothers. Jack and Dan, do well in their flower business. Tiiey have a beautiful shop in downtown Columbus. Joe told me an interesting stor\- of Ralph Gugliclmi. It seems the boy's father was an M.D. who spent years in the Navy, later died. As a result the boy was en­titled to a scholarship as the son of a deceased veteran. Despite many offers from other scliools he decided to use his scholarship at ND. Joe sa>-s Ohio State is really a football universit>'— football is always first in Columbus. If the coach can't win—Ere him. (After seeing Joe I went over to the Dcshler-Wallack Hotel and slept till noon next day. I should have called Joe up and in\-ited him over to lunch.) 
"So I went on to Springfield, where I saw AL TEHAN, *28. His oldest boy Al Jr. is await­ing draft call, age 20. His next boy Roger is going on 18 and also expects to go into service soon. Al told me'tha t his sister, Helen, who ^%•as at St. Mary's when wc vvere in school, had undergone a serious operation a few months ago, but had recovered. 
"Next evening I went out North ^fcridian St. in Indianapolis to see BOB KIRBY, '28. Kirby has ever>' reason in the world to call me a louse, for of all the times I've been in the Indiana capitol, I had never called him. As I approached the architectural splendor of the Kirby ^lortician's mansion, I chuckled and thought how surprised he would be. No luck! Tlic attendant. advised me that Mr. Kirby was out—gone for the day. But believe me—dying can be a treat and a pleasure if you can see in advance what brother Kirby has in store for you. From coast to coast I defy anyone in tlie business to rival the Kirby touch. He is a past master at the art. And I'll bet tlic people of Indianapolis love him for it. 
"I went on to my business in St. Louis. It being 95 degrees there I decided to get out fast and go home. On the way I stopped at ND to get some tickets for the Navy game. As I walked into the Athletic Office Mr. Lealiy approached looking as calm and serene as if the season were over and he had won ever>- game. Do you read that column he wTites? Maybe it isn't in Prof. Philipps* best st>'lc. But he must have some dam-good ball players. There is a storv- out that Tug Wilson spoke to Mr. Krausc about what some of the ND players were doing in the way of pre­season practice. A 28-day spring training limit had been mutually agreed on. So Krause said, *'A1I right. Tug, do you want to sec our movies of what the Big Ten players were doing?" So Mr. Wilson agreed to call it quits. 
"Saw SAM PRINGI, '27, recently. £am is build­ing a section of the New York Tliruway cast of Buffalo for his concern—Chapman, Drake and Piper. Sam used to be catcher on the high scliool team, and later the town team wc played on in Avon. Sam would like to hear from his old friends in the Engineering Scliool. His home address is Elwood City, Pa. 
"Also I learned recently that HAROLD "GAP" WELCH, '27, is working for tlic Railwav Signal Co., Rochester, N. Y. 
**\\'hat has become of MICKEY FL.ANAGAN. JOE McGLYNN, PAUL CANNON, BUDDIE SCHULL, MAURICE McMENAMIN? 
"Also JOE CANTY would like to hear from ART CANTY and TOM CANTY. 
SPOTLIGHT ALUMNUS 
W. H. STUEVE 
For W. H. Stueve, graduation ex­ercises at Oklahoma A&M this past Summer brought honors that were a fitting climax to 44 years of service in the realm of engineering. Mr. Stueve was awarded a professional degree in mechanical engineering, one of the highest conferred by the Oklahoma In­stitute of Technology. Now a consulting engineer in Oklahoma City for several major oil and pipeline companies, he is retired after serving as chief power consultant and executive assistant for the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Com­pany. 
A native Ohioan, Mr. Stueve is a member of the 1908 Class at Notre Dame and is active in the affairs of the Oklahoma City Notre Dame Alumni Club. He is married and has two chil­dren. 
Mr. Stueve is a fellow of the Ameri­can Society of Mechanical Engineers and acted as chief electrical engineer during the construction and operation of the "Big Inch" and "Little Big Inch" pipelines in 1942-43. 
"I'd like to find somebody who could and would donate a new library* building to ND. Some montlis back, I saw where Hon Joseph Kennedy, Boston, donated a million to a Sisters' organization in Chicago. There must be some potential Jos. Kennedys around. 
"I haven't much Bufl'alo news. The club is very active vritli a going program. The big excursion is to Cleveland to the Navy game next week. I'm going over Tliursday and stay for the week­end. TONY BRICK, Pres. of the Buffalo Club, gets out a good newsy letter, Tlic Alumni-AVives are going like a. house afirc.^ 
"My oldest son, Eddie, is home till Nov. 3, from San Diego. Then he goes to Camp Le Jeune as a member of the Second Marine Division. My oldest daughter, Margaret, was married this sum­
mer. Her husband is at ^erdeen Proving 
Grounds. So you see what you are coming to. 
However, both bo>-s are doing well in the service 
—should make 6rst class citizens. My younger 
children have great interest in hearing all the 
stories, details, etc. 
'^Diuing the next few weeks I expect to be in 
Detroit, Chicago and surrounding territory*. Some 
of my wife's family have moved out to Cape Cod, 
so I'll probably have to go out there and to 
Boston sooner or later. 
"At any rate if I find anything other than the 
casual news, I'll put it in tlie mail to you. 
**With all best wishes to your family and you, 
I am sincerely yours." 
Our able Vice-President for the South, Jack 
Canizaro, has contacted all Twent>--£ighters in 
the Southland and has received heartening assur­
ances from many of them: 
FATHER ANDY MULREANY, C.S.C.: "I ex­
pect to be at ND next year for the reunion. 
Of course, in this business one never knou3 what 
may happen. But with the help of the Lord, I'll 
see all of you in '53." 
GEORGE J. SARGUS: "I'll be there for the 
25th Reunion. I saw HENRY DAVIS of West 
Virginia and he plans on going." 
CYPRIAN SPORL, JR.: "Thanks, you can 
put me down." 
J. CARROLL PINKLEY: "I plan on attend­ing the Silver Anniversary Reunion next June." 
J. HARVEY DALY: "By AprH or May of next year, I'll know whether or not I can make it .. . one item of minor interest is that I'm lec­turing in the graduate school of the American University (D. C.) in Personnel Management." 
Our old friend "Art," ARTHUR L. DENCH­FIELD, JR., who hangs his chapcau at Recife, C Postal 21, Brazil, avers that he'll attend our 25-year reunion: "There isn't much I can tell you except that for the last seven years I've been General Manager of the Singer Sewing Machine Company for North and Northeast Brazil. I have four fine boys and have been married U years last June 13. I expect to be at Notre Dame for the 25th Reunion, which I trust will bring most of the Class together." 
Writes Barrister "BILL" JONES, President 
Louie's faithful friend: 
'*I have your recent note concerning the Silver Anniversary reunion of our class next June-I note where you have the reunion listed for June 4, 5 and 6 while Lou has it down for June 12, 13 and 14. I am not sure whether you are starting early and going to carrv* through for more than a week or whether Lou Buckley is getting there too late. 
" I certainly intend to be present at the reunion. I am also trying to interest others, particularly lawyers who are members of the class of '28, vvho received their law degrees in years other than 1928 and 1929. This I am doing bv request 
of Buck." 
JOHN B. BUSCHMEYER informs Vice-Presi­dent Canizaro that he will be on hand as follows: 
"I certainly plan to attend the reunion in June. TOM TRAUGHER and I expect to go up together, and we are both anticipating the best reunion ever." 
A breath of Texas' golden air in the form of a letter from LAURENCE >\TNGERTER, Vice-President and General Manager of the San An­tonio Transit Company, to Jack Canizaro: 
" I congratulate you upon your fine Job as Vice-President of the South and for doing some for^vard thinking about our 25th Reunion, now-only one year away. 

**I'vc been living in San Antonio for more than eight years and am a confirmed Texan complete with ten-gallon hat and' fancj- boots. There is an active Notre Dame Club here, but not manv from our class. RALPH GARBA from Saltillo, Mexico, drops in now and then for a chat. The purpose of his last visit was to find an electric motor to mn a cotton gin. He has gone in for cotton-raising in a big M-ay, and is doing ver%­well at it. 
'TRANK GALARDY and his wife stopped in while on an extended tour of Texas and Mexico. Frank is a majordomo of the Automatic Tele­phone Company in New York City. I saw GEORGE SARGUS on a recent visit to my old toM-n of Wheeling, W. Va. George is still in the dry goods business with side interests in soft-drink bottling and coal mining. 
"Ever since graduation I've attempted to send Christmas cards to the electrical engineers of the 
'28 class. But as the years roll by, addresses « . , „ „..—„. . .-.— „ Remember that FATHER ANDY MUUtEANY, 
change and names vanish from my list. But last Christmas I was vcr>- happy to get cards from JAMES F. BERRY in Stanley, N. Y., JOE BRAUNSDORF in South Bend, FRANK DU­QUETTE in Mount Kisco, N. Y., Frank Ga-lardy, Ralph Garaza, JOE HORAN in Fort Wayne, and JOHN LARSEN in Gcne\-a, N. Y. 
"Sure hope I can make the 25th Reunion. I 
had to pass up the 20th because of labor nego­
tiations and an impending bus strike. If the 
union will behave next Spring, IMl be with you 
with bells on." 
President Lou Buckley contributes his usual 
sprightly and interesting column. It follows: 
"I noted our Sccretar>''s inquiry in his excellent column dedicated to Dr. Cooney in the last issue of the ALUMNUS as to the whereabouts of journalist RICHARD A. GREENE. A few days later I was in Muncie, Ind., and noted in the Afuncie Star a column by Dick Greene carrying his picture. I immediately got in touch with Dick and had a most enjoyable time talking over old Sophomore Hall days. You will recall that Dick left Notre Dame in 1927 because of illness. "He is married and has been in newspaper and personnel work for a number of years in Muncie. Dick is now an editorial writer on the Muncie Star and writes a daily column of human interest news. He had an article in "The Sign" in June, 1945 entitled "Experience in Middletown." Dick completed an application for membership in the Alumni Amssociation before I left him and he assured me he would return foroar 25-ycar reunion next June. 
"The first step I would like to suggest in prep­aration for our reunion next June is for each of you to contact someone who was in our class and did not complete his work at Notre Dame and invite him to join the Alumni Association. Either -write to me or to the Alumni Office for an application for membership to be filled out and returned to the Alumni Office. Your cooperation on adding as many old students as possible to our class roster prior to June 1953 will be appre­ciated. Let me hear from you on this matter at 1253 North Central Avenue, Chicago 51, Illinois." 
The Congressional Record for May 1, 1952 on page A2755 carries a speech given by AVILLIAM 
E. BROWN of the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company on Unemployment Compensation. The presentation was delivered in Washington before the Congressional dinner of the Wisconsin State Chamber, of Wisconsin, at the Shoreham Hotel on April 29. Bill, who recently spent a year farming in Iowa, has returned to the legal department of Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Com­pany in Afilwaukcc. 
GEORGE COURY visited us recently. He has been spending a considerable amount of time in Chicago as President of Eicor Inc., a manufac­turer of electrical machincr>'. George indicated that he was resigning as President and would scr\-e only as Chairman of the Board. This will enable him to spend most of his time at his home in Florida with his wife and t^vo children. George mentioned that OSKAR RUST is in the department store business in Grccnsburg, Ind., and has six children, one of whom is at Notre Dame. 
I have seen FATHER MARK FITZGERALD, C.S.C., several times recently as he is Chairman of the Program Committee and I am Chairman of the Local Arrangements Committee for the Annual Afecting of the Catholic Economic Asso­ciation. Father Afark, w*ho received his Ph.D. from Chicago University last year, - is teaching at Notre Dame in the Department of Economics. He had an article on "U. S. Labor-Management Teams Help Europe" in "America** on Afay 24, 1952. 
At the suggestion of my old Corby Hall room­mate, DENNY DALY," I am re-reading "H. M. Pulham, Esquire*' by John P. Marquand in prep­aration for our 25-ycar reunion. I also read "The Life and Opinions of a College Class" by C. DuBois and C. Murphy. I would like to see a study made of the Class of 1928 for our reunion next June. Any volunteers? 
In accordance with TOM TRAUGHBER*s sug­gestion, I am designating the lobby of the Com­merce Building as the meeting place for '28 men at home games. How about meeting there at 11 
a.m. before the home games as proposed by Tom? 
My daughter, Paula, Avas married on May 31. She will complete her college work at Loyola University- this summer.' Am I the first '28er to

KARL MARTERSTECK was on the N D campus in September when Karl Junior registered as a freshman. The two could pass as brothers. Two guesses where Karl Junior was at Na^-y-game time. 
Also visiting during registration were ELMO MOVER and his wife, %vho drove through from Poughkeepsic, where they recently moved from Scotia, N. Y. Elmo h a design engineer with 
I.B.M. Their son Mike is a sophomore at ND and their daughter Betty a freshman at St. Mary's. Nancy is home entering high school. 
Another St. Mary's girl is the daughter of JOE WHALEN, formerly of Colchester, Illinois, and now manager o£ the largest hotel hetivccn Chicago and Denver, at Bes Afoines. FATHER LOUIS THORNTON visited with Joe recently and saw him again over the Oklahoma-game Weekend. 
FATHER CHRISTOPHER OTOOLE, Superior General, was present at the Oct. 19 dedication of the Fatima Shrine, cast of the Dixie Highway opposite the entrance to St. Mary's. He attended the faculty pot-luck on the preceding Tuesday. Had you been there, you'd assuredly have enjoyed the skit presented by Prof. ANDY SMITHBERG­ER and his Squires and Dolls. The four couples of squaredancers were faculty men. The dolls' foursome rivalled in beauty, grace and beef the chorus of the Monogram Absurdities. 
PAUL BARTHOLOME^V will again conduct the annual trip to ^Vashington, D. C , Williamsburg, Va., etc., for ND and S:. Xfary's students Jan. 29 to Feb. 4.

JOHN KUHN came tlirough with a fine letter. I hope that soon he may make that long-awaited trip to the west as there are many in Chicago who would like to see him. 
Dear Jim: When your card arrived some time ago, it ^vas like a delightful breath out of the past. It seems that my four years at Notre Dame are so long gone as to be almost imcertain, whether they really ever h^pened or whether I imagined it all, and there never were such people as BILL LEAHY, WALT CAHILL, FRANK HOLLAND, PHIL ANGSTEN, JOE BLANEY, the fabulous O'BRIEN t^vins, and JIM DOYLE. I think you will admit that 21 years is a very long time. As it is, one of my greatest regrets is the unfortunate distance that separates me from men that I lived ^vith and grew fond of. I often wonder what all

REV, JOHN E. DUFFY 

Father Duffy was recently elected National Chaplain of the American Le­gion. He is a member of the Notre Dame graduating Class of 1923. 
Serving as a Regular Army Chaplain for 14 years. Father Duffy was wounded six times in action in the defense of Bataan and Corregidor. He retired as a result of enemy inflicted disability and held the rank of Colonel. 
During the infamous Death March, Father Duffy was bayoneted by the enemy. In 1947 General Wainwright, in a speech made in New York, gave credit to Father Duffy for major guid­ance in the decisions the General made in Bataan. 
Since the war he has been pastor of Our Lady of Lourdes Church, New London, Ohio, where he rebuilt the Church in memory of the "Men of Ba­taan." 
of you are doing, how you are, what do you all look like and so on. Well, perhaps this may be a good beginning. I'll tell you a bit about me, and you can use it as you see fit, then perhaps one or more of the boys will drop me a line and friendships may be renewed that never should have lapsed in the first place. 
I am Vice-President in charge of programs for t^vo radio stations, one here in Poughkeepsic, and one 15 miles down the Hudson at Newburgh. In 1945, I was most fortunate in finding a ^vonderful young lady who agreed to put up with my vagaries for the rest of our natural lives, so the deed was done on June 30th of that year. On Sept. 2, 1946, we were blessed with a son, now five, who, if he continues as he is now heading, will make an ex­cellent halfback at Notre Dame. Two years ago, Peter, our son, found himself with a baby sister, subsequently christened Mary Anne, who by now has us all thoroughly under her spell: I am her personal slave. So now we are four, and h^py as jay-birds. 
A fe^v years ago we organized a Mid-Hudson Notre Dame Ctub which indndes men from New-bur^, Kingston, Poughkeepsie, Beacon, Sat^crtics and communities up and down the ri\-er. We are stUl small, but we do enjfiy our monthly meetings, and next year we hope to sponsor a Notre Dame Glee Club Concert in Newburgh. And so we grow. 
So much has hai^>cned since 1931, that it would be quite impossible to report in an intelligible manner. There was the war. I was a T/Sgt., and of course the depression. For many years I managed the family jewelry business, and then I joined the staff of the New York Sute Tax Com­mission in 1933 and am stUl with them as well as my present cikteavors in the field of radio, which is in my blood to the extent that I beh'eve I will stick. 
In person, I could do better, but at letter writing I am not so hot. Give my best to any of the boys you see and keep my best regards for yourself. As I remember you, ytta were a wee bit on the plump side. How goes it now? You may recall I was not too fat in those days, whereas I am now referred to at times, and unkindly, too, as hefty. I am completely white on the upper end, what there is left of it. It has been a real pleasure, Jim, to hear from you and I do hope the day is not too far distant when we may have a small reunion of our own in Chicago, my second home. Lots of luck, and 1*11 be looking forward to reading the column m the ALUMNUS.

EDDIE RYAN called last week to tell me that BILL CLEARY died of a heart attack last . August. I wiU write FATHER BOURKE MOT­SETT and ask him to say a Mass for the repose of his soul. Please remember him in your pray­ers. FRANK HOLLAND recently returned from a trip to Florida to see his brother, Jerry. With the snow we had today Frank's suntan is a real contrast. I see RED O'CONNELL occasionally at Frank's home as they are neighbors in Skokie, Illinois. I met BILL KEARNEY and BERT KORZEN the other night and they informed me that JIM KEARNEY would be in town for a tew days. 
TOM ASHE is with the Howard Hughes Tool Co., and recently moved to 715 Avalon Road, ^Vhittier, California. It w-as a real pleasure to hear from Tom and I hope that his next trip to Chicago will get him in at a reasonable hour. Tom xvrites: 
Dear Jim: I was cleaning out my desk yesterday (a pro­cedure which I follow each quarter so that things will not pile up too much), and found your postcard of June 23 requesting some news about the Class of '31. Incidentally, that card was sent to my old address in South Gate, and I hope you will change your records. I really did intend to answer your card when it arrived because you have done such an excel­lent job as class secretary, that you deserve the coc^>eration of everyone. I was traveling a good bit of the summer and it was just one of those cases where I put off the things that should be done. 
Although we have an extremely active Notre Dame Club oi Los Angeles, there are relatively few in the class of '31 and there is not much I can give you in the way of news. About the only one with whom I have any regular corre­spondence is JOE LAUERMAN who was men­tioned on your card. It is always interesting, howe\'er, to read about the fellows who were in our class (a short 21 years ago) and w-hcn­ever I sec pictures in the ALUMNUS I always recognize the faces despite the time that has el^ised. 
I stomKd briefly in Chicago on two occasions early in September .while changing planes. It was early in the morning so I did not ^ve you a ring, but whenever I get to Chicago again, I will certainly look you up. With kindest per­sonal regards.

GEORGE COSTELLO called recently to com­ment on the column in the last issue of the ALUMNUS. He was wondering if anyone has any trace of MAURICE BRANIGAN, originally from Columbus, Nebraska. In the last issue of the ALUMNUS there was a slight mixup io the listing of HASKELL ASKEWs letter and while some may have recognized the writer I am in­cluding it again for those who wondered how

JOHN HICKEY gut down to spend so much time in Oklahoma. 
Dear Jim: 
^fany thanks for your nice card. I was away when it arri\-cd so this letter will probably reach you late, but since there is nothing much im­portant in it, nothing will be lost. I guess I can cover the main facts since graduation in 1931 without a lot of detail. For three years, '31 to '34, I worked on the arson squad, investigating and prosecuting arsonists, and there were plenty of them in the depression years. During that time I made up my mind to engage in the insur­ance adjustment business so I went to the Uni­versity of Oklahoma in 1934 and 1935 to get the legal education I would need for tliis work. Since then I have been in the insurance adjustment business under the name of the .^skew Adjust­ment Co., except for three years in the Na\-\', Instrument Di\"ision NATTC, Chicago, Illinois, most of which was spent as Officer in Charge. So you might say I am an *'Okic" by way of Chicago and South Bend. 
I have been married since 1935 and we have two boys and a girl, the youngest is 9, and he is quite a ball player. It looks like he should be ready for Notre Dame before many more seasons. There arc no other '31crs in this cit>-. 
but we do have an active Notre Dame Club going now, thanks to BOB McFARLAND. We arc looking fonvard to the Oklahoma-Notre Dame game at South Bend this fall. This Oklahoma team plays a fine game of football, they haw a spectacular offense, and Wilkinson is coach in the Rockne spirit of fair play. 
ARCHBISHOP 0*HARA was here for UND night and it was wonderful to see him again. He is just the same, fighting for what is good and against what is bad. In men like him lies the hope of the world. Nothing much else, Jim. I do help the kids with Junior "Y" baseball, whicli is a big and fine training program for youngsters in this area. I have scr\'cd as presi­dent of the Oklalioma Association of Independent Insurance .Adjusters, and at present, am \*ice­prcsidcnt of Blue Goose, International, which is an association of State Managers for Fire Insurance Companies. Wc all help in the Parish Churcli and witli the Catholic Charities. We have a Catas­troplie Crew of 15 adjusters who assist in any catastrophe area in the United States, so we get around when the hurricanes, explosions and hail­storms strike. Trouble is we are so darned busy I never get to look up the Notre Dame men in the area. 
Although we arc a long •way from South Bend, 
it seems Notre Dame is always very close. I 
guess it's because Our Lady is always close to 
those who Io\-e her. I would sure like to hear 
from my old roomie, JOE MEITZLER. You arc 
doing a fine job for our class.

Last sunmier I nm into TED HUEBSCH at the Pe<^le*s Gas, Light and Coke Co., in Chi-c^o . Ted was asking about many of our class­mates. He is now^ living in Brookiield, Illinois. While in St. Louis recently I had the pleasure of seeing PAUL FEHLIG and his wife. They are the proud parents of six children so I could understand why Paul might be a bit late with a letter. 
While in St. Louis this summer I called JOE 
GOLABOW5KI and BROTHER £ D ROHRBACH 
at Coyle High School, but could not find them in. 
This stmuner my %vife and I took a trip to the 
west coast and in San Francisco I talked with 
PAUL GUSHING. He has been covering a lot 
of the world and should have lots of news for 
the next ALUAINUS. Paul had recently returned 
from Brazil and was about to depart for a ^v-cek 
in Anchorage. I had hoped to meet him for a 
few hours in Seattle, but at midnight he still had 
not checJted in at his hotel. Paul had been on 
the campus recently and has a son who is a senior 
at ND. He mentioned that PAUL ENRIGHT is 
now in Guatemala. In Seattle we \'isited with 
BERNIE LENOUE and his wife who also had 
DICK NEESON and his wife over to their house. 
I was tmable to make a luncheon date previously 
with Bemie and FATHER PHILLIP DUFFY of 
our class who is now in charge of the Chancery 
06iv-e in Seattle. Unfortunately we were unable 
to get hold of ROY BAILLIE for the evening. 
Bemie mentioned their very active Notre Dame

CHARLES CUNNINGHAM, brother of BOB "NIGGER" CUNNINGHAM, called a few min­utes ago to tell me that Bob passed away this afternoon in the hospital. It is quite a shock as I called Bob upon my return and talked to his Mother. He had a xirus infection and she suggested I call back in a week or so. He had been suffering from multiple sclerosis for the past three or four years. Those who attended the re­union in 1951 will remember him getting around in his "Cadillac" whelchair. Please remember him in your prayers. 

JUif McQUAID was in Chicago recently and then sent the following letter upon his return to Vincennes, Indiana: Dear Jim: 
Why don't you stay home now and then? Marie and I were in Chicago last week-end, and tried to call you Sunday afternoon (a bad time, FU admit) but found no one home. We had gone up for a wedding and with all the confusion and things that go on that was our first oppor­tunity to call. Sorry to miss saying hello. How are things with you and your family? Sure en­joyed reading the nice long news letter in the last ALUMNUS. 
Hc^>e to go up for the Oklahoma game on November 8, perhaps wc can meet and have a drink on the campus now^ that the Inn is open. Marie joins in sending our best wishes. 
—JIM McQUAID 

I wotdd like to suggest that with the holiday season coming we should remember Jtm with any gift subscriptions for any magazine published. It would be an excellent idea to send your renewals and ofiSce subscriptions to him. 
AL STEPAN recently returned from a three-month trip to Europe where he and his family had an audience with the Pope. His daughter, Marilce, took seventh place in the 100-meter free style event and second place among the American ^rls in the race. She broke the world's record in the tryouts for the 100-meter relay and came in second on the team. 
As this will be the last letter before Christmas I wish to extend to all our classmates my best wishes for a H^p y and Holy Christmas as well as a Prosperous New Yexu". I wish to thank all those who were kind enough to reply to my requests for letters as your cooperation has helped to make my job as class secretary a much easier one. ,

20 YEAR REUNION 
JUNE 12-13-14 
Joseph D. McCabe, Scc*r­6S2 Forest Ave. River Forest, III. 

Dear '33's: 
Forgive me if I become borcsome, but from now on I'm going to concentrate on the BIG 20-year reunion coming up in June. The class of *32 put on a fine show, and we want our get-together to be at least as good. So talk it up when yo« meet classmates. Get as many of your friends down as you can. It will be five years until there's another one, and since Stalin may have another variety of five-year plan up his blouse, maybe we'd better enjoy this one. 
I know you're as tired of reading my reminders to drop a line as I am of writing them. How­ever, wi:h as big an event as this on the docket, maybe youse guys could bestir yourselves if you get a good idea about the reunion and put it in the mail. If you forget my name and address, send it to JIM ARMSTRONG at school. He'll see that it gets to the right spot. 
Football is in the air now, and in every com­munity where there is a club of any size, there will probably be meetings, informal at least, to listen to the games. Wliile you're at a meeting like that, talk up the reunion again. I promise you, it yn\\ be worth all the time and money you have to expend to get there. Anyone who attended the past June reunions will fer\'ently at­test to that. 
And don't forget about giving with those ideas, men. Any thought you have on entertainment, gimmicks, or events of any kind, send *em in. There'll be a class committee working hard on arrangements and they'll need all the help they can get. 
Guvs I have seen recently . . . JOHN O'SHAUGHNESSY . . . MAURY LEE . . . JOE KIRINCICH . . . DON WISE .. . and lots of chums who weren't '33's, at the recent scholarship dance held by the Chicago club on the night of the Texas game. TOM "KITTY" GORMAN is now regional sales promotional manager of the Great Lakes Region. 
JOHN T. CLARK is now associated with Boyle, Flags & Seasan, general insurance, 166 W. Jack­son, Chicago. 
Macy has finally told Gimbel, and the left hand knoweth what the right doeth. My good friend and ALUMNUS neighbor—he conducts the 1934 apple stand on the next corner — ED AL\NS­FIELD, out of the benign goodness and immeas­urable charity of his Iieart, has sent your humble bellwether a long, fine letter. Fire away, Ed: 
"Here's one line that involves a '33 man, I believe. JOHN DEEB, '51 lawyer, introduced xne in the Law Building to JOE DEEB, his Grand Rapids brother, at the Pitt game. I remember Joe well, although he was ahead of me. Believ-e he was one of your guys. 
'^Another idea that may provide a paragraph and do the school some good: the new Inn would make a great stop-spot for alumni who travel, who go through South Bend on vacations or visits, and who look for locations of an interesting nature for sales and business meetings. 
"EDWARD HUNT, the veteran hotelman who manages the Inn, isn't able to advertise commer­cially because of ND's tax status, of course, but he is trying hard to get word around that they have a wonderful set-up for personal and business visits. I stay there all the time on my Indiana travels for C-Z, and I've never found a finer ipot. 
"Mr. Hunt could furnish any literature your avid readers may want, and perhaps a mention 
i 

The siurit of ND on a Korean hiOside. Pha Ryan, '35, UN Civfl Assntance Com­mand (Korea), submitted the photo. 
in the '35 report would inform your readers that alumni and non-alumni are welcome. Football week-ends this year have been sold for some months, of course. 
"Golf facilities and lockers, dining room, and private room layouts for meetings are quite an addition to the usual hotel accommfxlations. 
"Nice to see you at the scholarship dance.** 
Pardners, it*s only fair, if you hear anything about *34's of the old school tic who are out­standing, or even if they have only done such a commonplace act of heroism as move, please Kelp the imdersigned to repay by dropping £d a note. His address is Nata Products Company, 105 West Adams, Chicago 3, III. 
And while I'm mentioning the '34's, let me remind you that our reunion comes the year BEFORE their big 20-year get-together. Come down to the Bend this June, and you'll be in the right class. 
I hope that sudden forttme doesn't go to my head, but here's another letter the old hennit got recently. It*s concerning a suggested event AFTER our reunion — you know, that's the 20­year reunion, this June, Notre Dame, remember? The letter was from DICK QUINLAN, *28, and is so n(^ly self-explanatory, I*m going to quote it: 
'^Some of the members of the class of 1^8 have suggested that it sponsor a retreat, open to all alumni, immediately following the reunion weekend in June. It was thought that a number of returning alumni would wish to stay over for two days for this purpose. The retreat could open Sunday evening and close Tuesday e\-emng or Wednesday morning. 
"We should very much :q>preciate receiving an expression of your views vnth regard to the de­sirability of having such a retreat. It occurred to us also that you may wish to inquire of the members of your Class concerning their attendance at the proposed retreat.'* 
That letter sort of noses me into the regular ponderous pondering of matters spiritual. Fd like to ask all who have some special devotion to our Blessed Mother to say an earnest additional prayer for what to me u one of the more de­pressing scandals of our times: the perverted cult of Mariolatry allegedly current among followers of the tmfrocked Boston Jesuit, Father Feeney. Name-calling is not the intention of this reference to these misled cultists. But devotion to Mary is so necessary for an increase in grace and spiritual growth in general, it is stark tr^edy to see this devotion abused. A coldness' toward the Virgin and suspicion toward all veneration of the Mother of God are non-CathoUc characteristics; if I re­member correctly, so illustrious a convert as Car­dinal Newman spoke with some aversion concerning 
Catholw Mariology before his coaversion. Now this band of misguided zealots are quoted as call­ing on Mary to destroy tbose disagreeing with them, including prelates and members of the Church so conspicuously dedicated to Mary. Un­questionably God rights all wrongs and beals all wounds in His owm time; but let xa who love Mary make an extra ^ort throoi^ prayer to urge Him to hasten ICs 'own tnne* in this trage<ly

A number of new* addresses among '33's have been forwarded here, including (am listing only DeWALD, 426 West Oakdalc. Fort Wayne. Ind.; the NEW address): W.

(Hey, .Art, last I heard from you, you were in Connecticut. How about a few hundred words on the new pilch?) 
It's time for a little public confession. After all my hand-wringing about not getting mail, I go and forget to mention a faithful card-sender. GEORGE ROHRS has frequently taken time out from his preoccupation in the affairs of the New-York Giants (football, that is) to send a kind word." 
It is swell to hear from you, George — keep up the good work! And here's hoping you don't feci too badly about that 24-23 loss to the Cardinals. After aU, JOE KUHARICH is another nice ND guy out to earn that buck. .And if beating the Giants in a game like that one wasn't earning it, I'll go on relief.

Well, gang, this time we have something to reporl! Three communiques arrived from the field and from different parts of the country. We wonder if this means a return to tlie old days when wc filled a page in each issue of tlie ALUMNUS. 
Our first message came from ED KILKfURRY which notified us of his release from active duty with the Army-Judge Advocate General's Corps. He has returned to the general practice of law at 2057 Douglas Avenue in Racine, \\^sconsin, as of September 25. 
We arc happy for Ed that he has ser\"ed his stint and is now back in **dvvics." .And Avhilc we arc in the Kilmurr>' file, we want to note, though belatedly, the birth of Kathleen Rita ]ast January in ^filwaukee. On the heir our con­gratulations, and our apolog>- for the delay in reporting her arrival. 
.Along about the middle of September, we re­ceived a ver>- interesting Anniversary booklet called '*Around the Bend to Another 50 Years." At­taclicd was VIC KURZ^VEG's card as president of the Consolidated Companies, Inc., Xcw Orleans. 
The document told a fabulous tale of the growth of Consolidated Companies tlirough fifty years from 1901 ^%'hen Victor Kurzweg, Sr. ^vas bookkeeper and shipping clerk for Shcrbume-Schlater & Company in Plaqucmine, Louisiana, to 1951 when Senior was found ser\'ing as Chairman of the Board of Consolidated and our classmate. Junior, w*as President of the Company. This is the storj* of a wholesale grocery business from the "Mud Sled" to the dicsel-driven stern w-hcel packet. Our own Vic has been President since 194fi. 
On the Anniversay, on the booklet and on his s«th year as President, we congratulate Vic It is good to learn of the progress of our crowd. How about more of you letting us in on your acliievcments? 
TIic last release came from BOB SHIELDS the other day. Bob, living at 1822 Grand Avenue, Kalamazoo, Michigan, is still dair>*ing — here is his message: 
"First, many thanks for your efTort in main­taining tlie *35 column, %vhich I've enjoyed so much. 
"Xow, some material for you. 
"Going East on our vacation this past August, we stopped in Barkcrton, Ohio, and contacted BILL BERNARD and VIC WEIGAND. Had a nice \"isit with Bill. He has not noticeably changed since I saw him 12 years ago. He is obviously an important part of the Bernard Construction Company and is still a bachelor. Bill located Vic and I had a pleasant phone conversation with him. He married Bill's sister and they have three children. I was sorry to hear Vic's father had died earlier the same vveek. He is associated with his father's Buick agency. We tried to get out to the house to see Vic and his family, but our schedule dictated othenvisc. 
*«l4Ut month, at the Dairy Convention in Chi­cago I met BARNEY ENGUSH of Toledo, Ohio. He ss a partner in the Napoleon Creamery, which among other things does a large butter business. We found, that while we do no <iircct buuness, we apparently deal with mutual friends. 
"Also, met JIM O'MEARA, formerly of West Bend, now of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He is a vice-president of the W. M. Sprenkman Corpora­tion, A manufacturer and distributor of dairy equipment. Jim and I were both amazed that we immediately recognized each other at such a chance meeting after 17 years. 
"I looked for JIM KEOUGH of Duluth, Min­nesota (formerly of St. Paul) but ^vas not sur­prised that I did not find him in the 25,000 plus res^tercd. Could not determine if he was there. 
**For the past few months I've had the pleasure of lunch with JOE LYNCH as he makes his trips through Kalamazoo for O'Brien Paints. It gives us a fine chance to discuss the old and new. 
**As the letterhead indicates, I'm still in the milk, married, with three daughters." 
It was good to hear from you. Bob! Wc cer­tainly appreciate the word on our stra>*s around the country. We have no way of branding them unless our range riders send in a "hot iron" every so often. 
^Vhilc in Buffalo over a recent vv-cekcnd, we picked up a program which listed a number of £xhtt)itor5 at a Diocesan Teachers' Institute. There, tmder the American Seating Company at 923 West Gencsie- Street, S>Tacuse 4, New York, was NORMAN E. WIETIG's name. We have w*atchcd the 'S4- column these many years for word of our former classmates in Prep School back in Buffalo. (Class of '34 please copy.) 
ARTHUR L. CONRAD visited Notre Dame last summer in his position as president of the Her­itage Foundation of Chicago. Art delivered the keynote address for the National Federation of Catholic College Students convention in August. His topic at the opening NFCCS session \V3S **The Meaning of Education in the Modem World." 
That's it, gang! How about some more mail?

15 YEAR 
REUNION 
JUNE 12-13-14 
Charles Callahan, Sec'y-Sports Pnblidtr Dcpt. Notre Dame, Indiana 

General Chairman of the 15-ycar reunion in June will be DON FISHER, insurance man and the most active '38er in South Bend. Don. has been motivating force behind four wcll-attcndcd dinners of our class among those still residing close to school with the result that the Notre Dame Class of '38, South Bend Chapter, is a going organization. 
At the last meeting of the South Bend Chapter, there was a dual purpose of the gathering. The first was to honor the guest of honor, RAY MEYER, outstanding coach of the DePaul Uni­versity basketball team, who, as you all know, was the hoop captain our junior and senior years. The other reason was to discuss ways and means of making the 13th reunion the best ever . . . and if all the suggestions made during the evening come into reality, there never will be another reunion quite like the forthcoming one of ours. There will be -more details on the aflfair in the next issue of the ALUMNUS, but be assured that Fisher and his committees intend to make the gathering one that will be long remembered. 
As for notes . . . ^vell, first maybe I should tell of guys seen at the \'arious games this year. HAL ^VILLIAMS, DR. RIGO DiBRIENZA, CAS VANCE and CHARLEY MORRISON at the Penn game. ED HAGGAR (from Dallas) and JERRY CLIFFORD, over from Houston, at the Texas game. BOB DERENGOSKI (Assistant Attorney General of the State of Michigan with headquar­ters in Lansing), and HUB and FRANK KIRCH­MAN (business partners in Bay City, Mich.) at the Michigan State game. JOE CORCORAN (Brockton, Mass.) was in town for one of the home games and phoned the ofHce. TOM AIULLIGAN (about to. finish his second hitch in the Navy) was home in his native Cleveland for the Navy and hosted a party of Notre Damcrs, most of - whom were from *38 or in 
school at about the same time as ourselves. SCOTT REARDON expected to make the Pitts­burgh game, but at the last minute had to cancel out. 
At random .. . A card from Air. and Airs. FRANK MULHERN, received some time back, announcing the birth of a second child and the first son. . . . ED "WRAPE, now a professor at the University of Chicago. .. . J. J. GORMAN, still a bachelor in Detroit. . . . JACK ANTON, DICK SWISHER, an attorney in Oakland. . . . ditto in Chicago —• both look very happy. .. . DR. DAN MONAGHAN, another singleton, still resides in Denver, but makes almost every foot­ball game. . . . JOE RUETZ, line coach at Stanford , . . his buddy, JOE KUHARICH, head coach of the Chiirago Cardinals. . . . CHUCK SWEENEY, South Bend oil salesman and still officiating in the National Football League. Also, was Chairman of the South Bend Quarter­back Club .. . Sweeney has five boys, two girls. . . . Nice letter from NICK LAMBERTO, ^vho was pretty sick last spring. Nick is on the city desk of the Des Moines Register and Tribune. . . . GEORGE SMITH, in public relations with Indiana National Bank, Indianapolis, not married. 
-. . JACK FIRTH, with Sylvania Division, American Viscose Corporation, New York City . . . a letter from DICK BOWES, in Kansas City, Mo.; sez he hears from JACK RICKERT in is running a hotel in New Preston, Conn. . . . Honesdale, Pa., that ERNIE MAURIN is in oil business in California, and that TOM QUINLAN our national alumni president (and classmate), HARVEY FOSTER, the FBI biggie, is naturally mentioned more prominently elsewhere in this issue, but I should add that he always drops by the office when on the campus. . . . DR. TOM HUGHES phoned from Columbus about getting a movie, I forget whether he told me it \V3S seven or eight children. . . . BILL McNAMARA, an attorney in Chicago. . . . JIM CARSON, with Indiana Bell Telephone in Indianapolis, was a South Bend summer visitor . . . 
GctUng back on those at the footbaU games. . . . BILL COSTELLO, with Capehart-Fams­worth, in Chicago (I don't know how I forgot to mention it before—he and fair wife stayed at our house) at Pitt game. . . . CLIFF TALLMAN (Cleveland), and TOM WUKOVITS (Akron) at Navy game. . . . WALT DUNCAN (up from Tulsa) at Michigan State game. .. . I should mention that in most instances those greeted at the football games were with the Mrs. .. . 
In closing, I'm saddened that JOHN O'CON­NOR'S oldest girl died after a short illness on Nov. 1. He and his wKc Elizabeth have the sym­pathy of the entire class. John is an Indian­apolis attorney. 
FRANK WINNINGER is now doing sales work for the Hudson Pulp and Paper Corporation of Chicago. His business address is 360 N. Michigan.

JtAn L. Wiggins 11404 Rupio- Lane Dallas 14, Texas 
In the thiclc of this football season comes the first letter from BILL TRACY regarding the first game of the season, the ND-Penn game played in PhUadelplua. Bill writes: "I arrived in Pliila­dclphia in time to get In on tlic tail end of the pregame rally Friday niglit. I saw FRANK KAISER who advised mc he Is In business for himself in Chicago. I j'oincd a party of XY Notre Dame men, LARRY BRACKEN, GUS HARDART, and FRANK CONCANNON. PoIIow­ing the game. I passed up the regular cocktail part>' and checked in '\ritli the aforementioned at a party at the Warwick. ^Yhilc there I saw FRANK CONFORTI. WALT DESEL, FRANK KAISER, BUD DUPLEY, MIKE COMERFORD, LARRY TIERNEY, ROCK McQUISTON, DON KELSEY, and BUD JOHNSON. Also ran Into TOM W^ALSH and his wife at the pre-gamc party. Tom Is an FBI agent stationed In New York. I intend to attend the Oklalioma game at South Bend." Thanks for the letter. Bill, and please shoot us one after the Oklahoma game. Maybe some of tliat old Gate 14 mob still hangs out there after the home games. 
At the Texas game played In 95 degree weather in Aiistin, Texas, the only classmate in evidence was ROG CUMMINGS. Rog had made the trip from Midland and I from Dallas to see a fero­cious second half which netted a ball game for the team. The Class of *44 outdrcw us with JOE RUD, SAM WTNG, and BOB McBRIDE. 
Recently at a dinner given by the Dallas Notre Dame Club for JIMMY PHELAN, Class of ??, now coaching the Dallas entr>' in pro football, I saw JIM WHITE yvho now lives In Dallas and sells construction supplies. Jim left the campus shortly after Pearl Harbor, but returned after the war to get his degree and follo^v through In Law Scliool. Jim Is listed in another class but asked me about several of the '43 crowd: DOC CARBERRY, JERRY GAINER, BILL LOWER, and RALPH a\RABASL Haven't heard from any of those birds lately, so I could give only scant Information. 
BILL UNGASHICK passed through Dallas re­cently while making a sales trip for tlie bakcr>" equipment concern he represents. Bill works out of Kansas City. He said that he occasionally runs into a few of the class, and mentioned that be would like to sec JACK WIETHOFF, BOB MADDEN, and JOE JACOBS at the Reunion. Bill has agreed, since he covers such a large slice of the U. S., lo be our ro\-ing ambassador pro­moting attendance at the Reunion June 22, 13, 14. Says his next call migiit be on SAM McQUAID up in St. Paul. 
We would appreciate, and could certainly put to good use, a letter from anyone going to the games this Fall telling us whom they met after the game. You might even include the score, since they may sometimes escape tlie sports col­umns of our Southwest Conference rooters! Please %*Tite. 
Again — don't forget that big week-end in June. That's the 12th, 13th, 14tli. Get in touch with your old cronies and have them make the trip with you. We'll be looking for you.

ANOTHER YEAR This issue brings to an end another year of work and of ahccomplishxncnt. Accomplishment be-
The Notre Dame Alumnus 

cause the class has grown that much stronger, has expanded, and has a concxete organizational staff — ready for the hard work ahead. This issue brings the beginning of a renewed effort to collect dues, gather news, lay plans, and in gen­eral, to work harder toward the culmination of the real objective of this whole thing — the 10-year reunion, now only some two dozen months away. 
Your secretary wants to thank those men of the class who have made the work easier by volun­tarily submitting information throughout the year, and also thanks to the many who answered in­quiries and circulars that were sent out. To those who did not answ*cr, or who did not write, the reminder should be sufficient that without help this column cannot exist; and without strength the class can certainly not sun'i^'e. So cooperate, and please answer my questionnaires or inquiries. They cost mone>* and effort. Don't let us spend both in vain. 
This issue brings each man of the class, his family, and his friends heartfelt wishes for a truly joyous Season full of the true spirit of comrade­ship and friendliness. Afay the New Year bring full happiness and contentment to each of you. 
LETTERS FROM DEPARTMENT 

From DAVE CART^VRIGHT: "GrecUngsU I 
just laid aside the August'Septcmbcr issue of the 
ALUAfNUS and enjoyed, as ahva>'s, your mention 
of the others of the class and their doings. 
**Guc5s what? We have a new baby at our 
house. Candis Ann, bom August 10. I think 
you know we have four kids now. There • arc 
David (4 years), Thomas (3 years) Roberta (IJ/j 
years), and Candis (2 months). My wife, Marilyn, 
is back on her feet now and we sort of run 
meals, naps, baths, etc., on a 1-2-3-4 quick-
schedule basis. Why did we sleep in time-study 
classes, AI? 
**I've been in Akron since January of this year, working for the DeBartolo Construction Company of Youngstown, Ohio (EDWARD J. DeBARTOLO, '32, president). The company exclusively builds shopping centers in Ohio. Right now I'm bu5>* on one in Cugahoga Falls. It's 1000 feet long with 25 stores. Along with the parking field, the center occupies over 20 acres of ground. I hope to have it finished by February of next year. I just fim:;hcd a center in June on the West side of Akron, Ohio. Certainly consider myself very fortunate having such a wonderful opportunity — being in the nucleus of a trend which is changing o«r whole s>-stcm of retailing. We have five of these large centers under construction at present. 
**I'm anxious to get news on some of the old gang —^VILLIE WRAPE, CHUCK SARTORE, WARREN CARTIER, ED BALL. AL WRAPE, and so many of the old ROTC'crs from Walsh Hall. I've been out of touch with practically cver>"one for about a year. 
"And Al, under separate cover I'm sending my $1.00 dues to RAY BADDOUR. See you in '55, and best regards." (Thanks a great deal for the kind words, Dave. Sure is a pleasure hearing from one of the mainstays and original ''charter" members. Congratulations on that wonderful fam­ily of yours. I am ccrt^nly envious of you. Will certainly be looking fonvard to that '55 date. Good luck, and congratulations again.) Dave's new address is 428 Louisa Street, Akron, Ohio. 
From RAY BADDOUR: "Enclosed arc the fonns which I have obtained from the bank for our Glass account. Would you picttsc fill them out and return them to me. The money is beginning to come in. So far I have received sLx returns, counting yours. Incidentally, this is the beginning of the term for M.I.T., and I am swamped with work. Next week, though, I anticipate being able to set up the necessary book work for keeping complete records of payments deposited to the class account, along with other interesting infor­mation and comments which arc included with the checks I receive. Best regards to all." (Good work, Ray, and I hope that the sue diecks will grow into something more representative of our class spirit without our having to spend most of the money to get some "stragglers" to send theirs in. One dollar is not too much, and it will mean everything to the class effort. Hope to hear from you soon. Good hick.) Ray's address for those of the class who ha\'c neglected to send theid $1.00 dues is Department of Chemical Engi­neering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Alass. 
turned from Vince Gushing. Rushed correspond­ence to the Alumni Office brought forth the an­swer that their records showed no address for Vince either since their mail was returned "un­claimed" also. Now, how docs one of the most popular fellows of the class get to become "lost." Vince is one of the "charter" members who helped to start the class off toward reorganization at the reunion in 1950, and this secretary certainly does not intend to lose him. So wherever you are, Vince, you better write immediately, if only a postcard, giving me your address. If you're hiding out so you won't have to pay the dollar dues, take another guess because we'll track you down. Your last known address was 1400 Lake Shore Drive, Chicago 10, Illinois. "SVe'II take the hunt up from there, and we'll find you!! Someone must know your address. One of the class may spy on you. Let that be warning enough. Be­sides, you're too prominent a member of the class to lose interest now. Write soon. Please.

It was a bright, sunny Saturday, and everything breathed the joy of living. The sun's paternal rays penetrated evcry^vhcre, suggesting the all-embracing love of the Son. 
I had just returned from our weekly exam at Fort Knox's clerical school. But now, excitement reigned supreme; orders from 2nd Army Hq were on their way to us. I had just Hipped my note­book on the bed when someone told mc mine were on the bulletin board. I hustled tou'ards the door and to the "Spot"—barely a hundred feet away. 
I looked and looked again. It read "FECOM." I was stunned. Many thoughts entered my mind and x'arious conflicting emotions warred within my being. But then I stopped still. Among other things, God had blessed mc with the Faith and a Notre Dame education. Several times I had pointed out to my barracks buddies that we be­lieve each one's life has a purpose (ralson d'etre, if you want to get technical) governed by Pro\*i­dence. It dawned on me that they would watch to see if I lived what I claimed to believe. It wouldn't be cas>'. 
Opening my wallet and quickly glancing at the photos in it, I flipped the flaps to the place where I kept my crucifix. Near tears, I tried to make an act of resignation and struggled to repeat it. 
Time passed; the sun warmed the air while the Son's love was thawing out my chilled fears. I looked up at the sky and glanced beyond it to our common Creator. The shadows faded and peace resumed its sway. Now, I returned to the barracks and some teased me about my new assignment. However, the fellow who bunked next to me asked about it. "My best Friend arranged it," I said, struggling for"a smile. 
Now, I'm not the only guy who has or will receive such orders and I know others will be more resigned. Yet, I hope this will show: 
What tho the odds be great or small 
Notre Dame men can win over all.

"It was a pleasant and moving ex­perience to read The Conquest of Life, the recently published volume contain­ing the choice addresses of Father John 
W. Cavanaugh, C.S.C. together witii a biographical sketch prepared by Father John A. O'Brien." Thus spoke Frank C. Walker '09, Chairman of tlic Associate Board of Lay Trustees, in an informal talk to the priests at Corby Hall on a recent visit.* 
"Reading the book," he continued, "brought back fond memories of my student days when Father Cavanaugh was in his prime as an orator. I could see him again, standing in the pulpit, his melodious voice filling Sacred Heart Church as with the music of a mighty organ. 
"His diction was polished and his de­livery was natural and graceful. Uplift­ing and inspring thoughts found utter­ance in beautiful language, enabling him to achieve an eloquence unsur­passed among the educators of his day. 
"I heard him give many of the great addresses which are reproduced in The Conquest of Life and the reading of that volume will bring Father Cavan­augh back to life for all the old stu­dents who knew him." 
Similar was the enthusiastic com­

ment of Joseph B. McGljTin '12, re­
garding this book as e.xpressed on a 
recent visit. "Since my student days," 
remarked Mr. McGlynn, "I have car­
ried a vivid memory of the gracious 
and kindly priest who presided over 
Notre Dame and who had a friendly 
smile and a word of encouragement 
for ever)' student on the campus. 
"To the students of that day. Father 

Cavanaugh was the greatest orator in 
the land. To listen to him was like at­
tending a class in public speaking, Eng­
lish literature, philosophy and religion. 
"Still echoing in my ear," went on Mr. McGlynn, "are some of his favorite sayings: 'The soul of culture is culture of the soul.' 'Comfort is an enemy of scholarship.' 'A diet of even the best fiction is an enemy of scholarship.' 'The kingdom of knowledge sufTereth patience and the patient bear it away.' 
"To the old students," Mr. Mc-GljTin concluded, "Father Cavanaugh is linked with Notre Dame as the soul is linked with the body. He is still a part of Notre Dame—a part of its tra­dition, its legends, its heart, its spirit, so undefinable and yet so all-perva­sive. Something of the fragrance of his memory' hovers like a benediction over the campus that he loved. The music of his life has ended but its mel­ody, unique, distinctive, unforgettable, lingers on in this remarkable book. The Conquest of Life, which has re­captured his spirit and personality so accurately." 
Father Joseph A. Maguire, C.S.C, is among the dwindling number of contemporaries of Father Cavanaugh left at Notre. Dame. After reading in this book the biographical sketch of his old confrere, he said: "It is indeed re­markable how Father O'Brien has brought the old President of Notre Dame back to life. His big-hearted character, his warm friendliness and deep personal interest in each student are vividly depicted in this book. 
"His wit, eloquence and wisdom," he continued, "are thus perpetuated 
*The Conquest of Life by John W. Cavan­augh, C.S.C, edited with Biographical Sketch by John A. O'Brien, St. Anthony Guild Press, Paterson, New Jersey, $2.50. 
and brought through the medium of the printed page to a still larger au­dience. Father Cavanaugh is part of the imperishable traditions of Notre Dame and he must be smiling as he looks down from Heaven upon his old students reading the addresses he preached so often to them from the pulpit of the Sacred Heart Church and from the stage of Washington Hall." 
To all who neither heard Father Cavanaugh speak nor knew him person­ally, this volume will bring something of his friendly and engaging person­ality, his radiant smile, his warm hand­clasp, his ready wit, his high idealism, his wide sympathy and his deeply spir­itual and Christlike character. Thus will he be enabled to continue his ministry of education, counsel, help and inspiration to young and old alike. 
The Conquest of Life in the course of a few months has climbed to the position of a best seller and has elicited praise from critics far and near. To the large and far-flung family of No­tre Dame Alumni the book will bring several hours of pure joy and inspira­tion, and it will make them the heirs of the knowledge and wisdom of one of the most beloved priests ever to step upon the campus of Our Lady's university.
