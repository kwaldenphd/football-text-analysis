we have repeated from the beginning, football ticket advantage is not the reason for giving, nor the measure of loj'alty, nor even a reward for giving. It is simply the onl)' measurement we have for achieving an equitable dis­tribution of a limited number of tick­ets.) 
The Magazines 
All alumni, regardless of contribu­tion, receive the ALUMNUS four times each year and its abbreviated four-page version twice, and also re­ceive the four annual issues of NOTRE DAME magazine. If you do not receive these pubHcations your ad­dress is at fault. A postcard to the Alumni Office, Notre Dame, Indiana, will correct this situation. 

Large Gifts 
Many alumni seem to feel that the University has been graduated into a financial Utopia where only the mul­tiple-dollar gift is sought or welcomed. Actuall)', the broad base, and the very backbone of Notre Dame's financial structure is the small gift from the many Notre Dame men. Several of the major benefactions in the millions have come because of the conviction of the donors that the j'oung alumnus with his new job and his new family was doing his best with his small an­nual gift. Without this participation, and its evidence of good spirit, Notre Dame will not succeed with large don­ors, non-alumni, or business appeals. 

Non-Graduates 
For those men who attended Notre Dame for only a part of their under­graduate years, and did not receive a degree, the Board of Directors of the Alumni Association provides an appli­cation form for membership in the .'Mumni Association. All non-graduate former students are welcome to apply, and the Board votes at each meeting on the list of applicants. Many of our most active Club, Class, and even Board members, have been from this interested and loyal group. 


The Notre Dame Spirit 

No one seenis able to put his hands on a complete definition. But travel­ing through the countrj', enjoying the cooperation (and hard work) of Club officers, and hearing the comments of non-alumni on the vitality of the Notre Dame program, you feel that the spirit of Notre,Dame is the most tangible force in the University's pro­gress.—Jim Armstrong. 
Vol. 31, Xo. 4 JULY-AUGUST, 1953 
James C Armstrong, '25, Editor Jolin N. Cackley, Jr., '37, Associate Editor 
This magazine is published bi-monthly by the University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Ind. Entered as second class matter Oct. 1, 1939, at the Postoffice, Notre Dame, Ind., imder the act of Aug. 24, 1912. 



&di:txi^U<d G041Ufie4iU AlumTsecrltary 
This is about the first year since World War II that I have been in a position to visit many of the Local Clubs. The result has been the con­viction that Notre Dame has the best and most far-flung alumni, from the standpoint of active Clubs in all parts of the nation (and some active ones outside). Another result has been the conviction that some of our repeated policj' statements are not read, or un­derstood, b}' many of our good and interested alumni. 
The Foundation Gift 
The annual gift to the Alumni Fund is also an annual gift to the Univer­sity and is handled and credited through the Notre Dame Foundation. All this is one gift. But, taking the place of the old and discontinued sj's­tem of "dues" it is also credited to your Foundation participation in your area; to your Local Club participa­tion record of giving each year, and to your Class record of giving. 
Competitive Appeals We receive many comments on competitive appeals for financial sup­port. We are well aware of the i^arish appeal, the diocesan appeal, the chari­ties appeals, the mission appeals, the magazine appeals, the parochial and high school appeals. It is a source of pride to Notre Dame that one of the results of our training of a moral responsible leader­ship is the presence of Notre Dame alumni in the top brackets of all these campaigns. That is whj' we feel cer­tain that bishops, pastors, charity di­rectors and school heads, along with religious periodical editors and mis­sionaries, welcome the presence of Notre Dame in j'our annual budget along with their own pressing causes. 





vame hMiumrms 
And we know the demands of home, of famil}', of education on j'our lim­ited income. But in the case.of young alumni parents, particular!}', the day will come when j-ou are ready for' Notre Dame to train your son. And it is by j'Our modest participation each year now that j'ou guarantee that Notre Dame will then be ready to do the job you will expect. 
We do not expect all. Few people give all to anj' one cause. But we cannot suspend our progress. We go forward with all, or we go backward to mutual disadvantage. So include Notre Dame. 
As for other appeals to you, the Alumni Association does not furnish mailing lists to outside, even to affili­ated Congregational, activities. Among these are many with genuine merit. We cannot prevent j'our receiving man}' such appeals. Their disposition must be within j'our judgment, j'Our charity and your ability. 
Football Ticket Preference 

Because football tickets are still in short supply, the distribution must be limited. As a consequence, because the annual gift is about the onl}' regular "j'ardstick" of interest we have, the advance alumni application forms are sent (about the first week of June) to the Alumni Fund contributors of the previous year. The Annual Alumni Fund is on the calendar year basis— the current 11th Fund, for example, began on Januarj' 1, and closes on De­cember 31, 1953. All contributors to this Fund will be recipients of the ad­vance sale applications in 1954. We have made an exception for the Janu­ary', June and -A.ugust graduates of the current year, who receive this privilege by a contribution made to June 15. (-A.S

but progress is being made in adjusting the publications situa­tion whereby it is hoped you'll soon receive the ALUMNUS and NOTRE DAME on a sj's­tematic basis. Since this was the 'Class Edition,' club reports had to be digested and con­densed on two pages because of space shortage. The current ALUAINUS and the last NOTRE DARIE were both printed off-campus. Instead of the usual 48 pages it was necessary to limit this ALUTUNUS to 32 pages. Our sincere thanks, again, to club and class secre­taries, as well as to our readers at large, in being patient until we can resume a normal publish­ing schedule. (JC).

Notre Dame Signs 5-Year Contract With Newly-Formed Theatre Chain To Sponsor Home Game TV Movies 
Notre Dame's 1953 home football games will be telecast into a nation­wide chain of theaters, according to a statement recent!}' made bj- Milton N. Mound, president of a newlj'-formed closed circuit television corporation. The simultaneous telecasts, which will not conflict with the one-per-season re­striction of the NCAA, will begin with the Notre Dame-Pittsburgli contest in South Bend on Oct. 17. Mound said 

Father Joyce speaks to Buffalo UND Night group. 
that a five-year contract has been sign­
ed with Notre Dame for all home 
games and that basketball games wll 
be tried on an experimental basis in 
1953-54. 
Though Notre Dame's venture into theater-television of football games has the "blessing" of the NCAA, most college athletic people are adopting a "wait and see" policy. The NCAA specificallj' "encourages experiments into 'p'ly ''s you see' television of col­lege sporting events" and Notre Dame has taken tlie governing body of col­lege athletics at its word. 
The extent of theatres carrjMug these telecasts will not be known for some time but Mound stated that 110 movie houses in 62 cities are equipped with a big screen necessary' for show­ing the games. About one-third of the theatres have already agreed to go along with the plan. . 

Football games scheduled include: Pittsburgh, Oct. 17; Georgia Tech, Oct. 24; Na^i', Oct. 31; Iowa, Nov. 21; and, Southern Methodist, Dec. 5 
Included in the deal are the 1953-54 rights to the following Irish basket­ball games: Dec. 7—Northwestern; Jan. 11—St. Louis; Jan. 19—Purdue; and, Feb. 15—DePauI.

The Alumni Association 
University of Xotre Dsinie 
702 Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust BIdg. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Dear Fellow Alumni: 
During the week of June 21-27, your Alumni Secretary, Jim Armstrong, Joe Farrell, Pennsylvania Governor of the Foundation, and myself took what can be termed an experimental "field trip" throughout Pennsylvania. W e visited the Alumni Clubs of Wilkes-Barre, Philadelphia, Scranton, Harrisburg, Pittsburgh and Erie. It was a worthwhile experience both for the Clubs and for us. We regret that time and the expanse of geography prevented a more extensive visit. 
We certainly became better acquainted with individual Club problems, and the Clubs better informed on University, Alumni and Foundation problems and views. We hope it will ail add up to better understanding, mutual aid and satisfaction. 
However, I want to mention one point which seemed prevalent in all quarters, and that is the general impression that Notre Dame expects monetary assistance to the virtual exclusion of all your other charitable obligations. Such an impression was never intended. The University recognizes your local needs, and has taught you, to contribute to your Church, support your local schools and charities. All the University as';s is that you PARTICIPATE in the Annual Alumni and Founda­tion campaigns and that you keep Notre Dame and its needs in the forefront of your charitable benefacHons. 
Also, you as individuals and as Clubs can gain many friends for Notre Dame if you will speak of her academic and cultural accomplishments whenever possible. I by no means intend that you should de-emphasiie our athletic accomplish­ments. The world knows and we are all intensely proud of them. Notre Dame men know the many other achievements but I urge more of you to disseminate this side of Notre Dame to others whenever the occasion permits. 
Sincerely, /s/ JOHN H. NEESON, JR.. President

ALOENUS GIVES ADVICE ON HOLY CROSS ORDER 
(Ed. Note: The following letter was recently received by the Holy Cross Fathers-at Notre Dame. It is suggested that in those cases where a young man is thinking of the priesthood, but is still un­decided about the seminary he will attend, the alumnus can be of great assistance in advising him of the Holy Cross Seminarj- on the Notre Dame campus.

Dear Father: For some time I have been con­templating the priesthood as my vocation in life. A teaching order seems to be verj- much to my lik­ing.

NEW YORK WRANGLERS ORGANIZE IN MET AREA 
About two years ago JOHN Mac-CAULEY, '41, and TOM McGEE, '41, organized a group of ND Alumni —patterned after the Wranglers on the campus. 
At the present time we have fifteen members and we meet each month for dinner m New York City. At each meeting one of the members presents a. paper on the topic of his choice—usually one of current inter­est, and preferably controversial. After the presentation of the paper follows organized discussion and re­buttal. 
A few of the topics which have been covered include: Universal Military Training; Vatican Ambas­sador; Importance of Air Power; Responsibility for Public Morality; 1952 Election Analysis; Point 4 Pro­gram; Far Eastern Policy; Current Criticisms of Advertising; Socialized Medicine; U. S. Foreign Policy; De­velopment of U. S. Immigration Policies. 
We have been thinking that simi­lar groups possibly are organized in other sections of the country. If so we would like to hear from them. And, any of your readers interested in learning more about our New York Wranglers can get in touch with the Corresponding Secretary:

FATHER GEORGE FISCHER. C.S.C, sure­ly made a "smash hit" with his "Nostaliga— The Golden Days at N. D." recently published in this column. In answer to public demand for some more words from Father George on subjects so dear to the hearts of the old timers, he very graciously and generously submits an­other classic which we are very happy to print for the enjoyment of our readers: 
THEN THERE WERE THE BUNS 

"Remember how almost as soon as you hear about FATHER CAVVY and the Dome, you heard about the buns? . . . There was some­thing special about them you were told. . . . And they say that the secret of their ingredients went with BROTHER WILLIBROARD to his 
holy grave . . . and remember that first Pull­man ride, that first breakfast in a train diner . . . and then, just past Mishawaka how the older men pointed out the Dome for you from the train windows . . , then the disembarking at the old station . . . and the guys from Chi and Nebraska and Ohio and Kentucky and Iowa . . . how you looked one another over . . . not ex­actly knowing how they were going to move into your life and afi'cctions during the next few months and years . . . then the settling-down . . . getting your room, so bare and so UNluxurious . . . and could you fit your stuff into it .. . a room that needed a lotta living-in before it became YOURS . . . the unpacking and the realization, from what you'd seen and been told, that you couldn't wear that High School monogram on the campus . . . and the realization that yotir shirts weren't Notre Dame, nor your ties nor your shoes . . . but you'd have to hurry to get in line at the windows - . . then FR. MOLONEY'S tongue-in-cheek whistl­ing over your dad's check . . . and FR. SCHU­MACHER'S fatherly. 'This is your schedule. Son.* . . . Your first meeting with FR. T. BURKE who was Discipline . . . and your first glimpse of the legendary FLO of reputed great influence at court . . . then the first students' Mass and FR. CAVVY'S sermon . . . how stunned you were to find how he was preaching right at you . . . and then Washington Hall and BROTHER CYP and the Practical Ideal­ism of MR. PAULDING and his reading of Shakespeare and Milne and Barric and others 
J. je>^ 

 hundred members back for their 5th. 
. . . and the special assembly in Washington Hall and FR. CAVVY sweeping through the long drapes and discoursing on student courtesy and 'beer and chivalry' on the Hill Street car and dropping his notes for one of CYP'S menials to reclaim . . . and, of course, every morning, the matchless BUNS and that butter from BROTHER LEO'S farm .. . and then the Sun­day awe of St. Mary's and the envy of those who had 'cousins' there . . . and experimenting with that new ND monogrammed pipe . . . and those walks around the lake . . . then the thrill­ing meetings of the Friends of Irish Freedom . . . the tingling speeches of clergy and laity . . . and the prodding by Father and Brother for Sunday Mass . . . again a sermon that someone wrote just for you . . . then that lazy Sunday after­noon when you couldn't afford to make town . . . and that Indiana sunset, best in this country and most like Italy's, they say . . . throwing stones over the lake . . . the Oliver very far away for you .. . so back to "Our Sunday 
The Noire Dame Aliiwnus 

Visitors' of wieners and the rest of the sparse Sunday night supper . . . and then Monday which somehow always came . . , Father and Brother getting you up for Morning Prayer and then The Buns again . . . somehow you never got tired of them and th*; way they treated the butter that you loaded onto them . . . was there something in the coffee? . . . and Friday's Chi-cago-river-carp but the five-by-eighl pies, with butter spread lavishly on lop . . . they compen­sated . . . and the friend who had a 'cousin' across the way and your loan to him of shin, tie and socks and shoes . . . and have a nice time, you lucky dog . . . and I'll walk the lake and then do my English for FR. CRUMLEY and read those chapters for FR. BOLGER . , . and an occasional stogie from FLO . . . and then 'Too Much Brandy* for the Army and G£?P running wild and we just HAD to parade to South Bend . . . but The King thoufht different­ly, as we learned when He met us in the lobby and DARED us to leave Walsh without per . . . and then the Buns . . . and the white-haired Brother who'd shovel his minims into the bleach­ers of Cartier Field for every game, at the last minute, too . . . and SISTER LOURDES who'd put the butter on the plates and the coffee into the pots before they were put into the trucks . -. and AL SLAGGERT running to us to tell that wc were licking Nebraska and HUBKA . . . and the students' trip to Northwestern to see GIPP star .. . and GEORGE COUGHLIN'S cryptic 
•pray for Gipp' that Saturday morning when wc knew George was losing his fight. . , . Next day there were the Buns, may their charms be chanted!" 
Do not fail to write a post card or brief note to Father George to encourage him to continue his wonderful contributions to this department. Father George is located at Tucker Road, North Dartmouth, Massachusetts c/o Holy Cross Mis­sion Band.

V. (TONY) CAPANO bucked the November landslide and returned to the Pcnna. General Assembly." As it read, ".. . backed the . . .'* Thus it appears that a D 1 became a R n. Sorry, Tony, that my handwriting changed your politics. Then I wrote that BERT DUNNE had stopped T. V. shows and that came out "staffed" them. Poor Sister Ventura who spent so many hours teaching me to write! As I look over what I have written here, I believe that I'll try to ease the Editors* pain by asking my daughter to retype it. (Daughter's note: she ain't much better than Pop.) (Ed. note: Serves you right for going to college, John. Writin' ain't never helped no one we know of.) 
During a recent trip to Portland, Oregon, your secretary had the pleasure of a short visit with NORB KAVANAUGH and learned during the visit that that old southern gentleman, WINK WINGERTER (see last issue of ALUMNUS) was Norb's brother-in-law. Norb's arthritis still keeps him pretty well tied down but does not prevent his carrying on a thriving legal prac­tice. 
A short time back I had quite a newsy letter from GERRY MORSCHES. Among other things, he told me that his son. Bob, is a freshman at 
N. D., and his son, David, is a freshman in the Army in Korea. Gerry was in Washington, D. C, last fall and tried to reach both WALTER TROHAN and FRANK BON but was unable to contact either. A later business trip took him to Miami where several phone calls back and forth was the best he and our Southern Vice President, IZZY PROBST, could work out. 
A couple of weeks ago Mrs. Ryan and I had a very pleasant evening with Gerry and his lovely wife and daughter. It came about in this way. As I remarked in my last column, my son, Denny, was due out of the Army on his retiuti from Japan in March. That worked out accord­ing to schedule, and the next move was to get a job. He went to work for Capehart-Fams­worth in Fort Wayne shortly after he got home. As FRANK WALSH handled his insurance mat­ters in Chicago, I figured that he should keep his business in the Class of *26 so suggested that he get in touch with Gerry when he got to Fort Wayne. When we hit Fort Wayne for a week-end visit, we learned that we were invited to Gerry's home for Saturday night dinner. 
Aside from these visits with NORB KAVA­NAUGH and GERRY MORSCHES and a tele­phone conversation with Treas. GEORGE HARTNETT, your secretary had had no news from our other classmates. Perhaps our Vice Presidents — GELSON, MOONEY, PROBST and DUNNE—could stir up the boys in their areas to write to them (or to me) with some news. Remember it's only a short three years until we "Mix in '56." Maybe a question about some of our classmates might bring some news. For instance, I've heard that MSGR. JOE TOO­MEY has added a pastorate to his Catholic Char­ities duties. What's the word, Joe; are you keep­ing busy? And how about GERRY McDER-MOTT? Somewhere I heard that he has moved from New York, Is that correct, Gerry? Who else might have some news? 
In the last issue of the ALUMNUS you read that ART SCHEER had died. And our class has lost two more members since then. TINO POGGIANI and CLAUD JOHNSON died dur­ing April. Please say a prayer for the repose of their souls.

There were too many highlights in our mem­orable reunion week-end to cover all of them here. The many letters I have received have emphasized the colorful march of the Class to the banquet led by the 1928 band — the inspir­ing talks by FATHERS WALSH and HES­BURGH at the luncheon and by FATHER MULCAIRE at the cemetary — the impressive Class visit to the Grotto on Saturday night — the crowded chapel and the glee club choir at the Masses in Lyons Hall — JACK LAVELLE and BOB KIRBY as distinguished toastmas­tcrs — the seeing of old friends and professors in such congenial surroundings — and the in­teresting collection of family pictures. 
FATHER JIM McSHANE observed, "one of the finest experiences I ever had by far." 
• VINCE CARNEY commented, "the big joy of the whole deal was to find the friends that we thought most of a long time ago, are still tread­ing the same level." ED BOURKE wrote, "I never realized that a week-end could be packed with so much fun and enjoyment." JOHN LEITZINGER noted, "I don't know of any­thing I have attended that has given me the real enjoyment that this retmion did." JOHN IGOE added, "It was in my life an event as memorable as any other and so replete with surprises and pleasures that it will easily sus­tain me for the next 25 years, God willing." Unfortunately space does not permit quotations from the many other letters I have received from classmates since the reunion. 
One of our favorite professors, PAUL FEN­LON, wrote "the most perfect if not the most pluperfect reunion I have ever known." Paul continued, "not a trick missed, not a false play, not one bad moment." JIM ARMSTRONG ob­served, "a new pace has been set for posterity and '28 has done it again." 
Those coming from the greatest distance for the reunion included ART DENCHFIELD from Brazil, JOSEPH E. MORRISSEY from Oregon, PAT VARRAVETO, CHARLEY LYNCH and BOB NICKELLS from California and RALPH GARZA from Mexico. 
JOHN LEITZINGER, with JI children in­cluding six boys, had the largest family and the most sons. -EDWIN F.-BRENNAN .had the

most girls with six daughters. JERRY BIGGE and DR. FRANK GUARNIERI each had a child bom within the past month, thus being the fa­thers with the youngest children. 
There were approximately 215 men who re­turned or 43 ^ of the Class including old stu­dents and 1929 LL.B. men. Fifty per cent of the men who received degrees in 1928 were present for the reunion. 
Spcial recognition should be given to the archi­tects and the 1928 LL.B. men as two-thirds of the men in each of these two groups were pres­ent. The lawyers came from every part of the country including the following from the great­est distances: BILL HURLEY (Massachusetts), BILL DALY (Georgia). CYP SPORL (Louisi­ana). RUBE MOMSEN (Texas) and CHARLEY LYNCH (California). Incidentally, CHARLEY LYNCH is doing an outstanding job as Presi­dent of the Los Angeles Notre Dame Club. The excellent turnout of architects included JIM CANIZARO (Mississippi) and PAT VARRA­VETO (California) who came the greatest dis­tances. 
Over 50*;?^ of the Commerce, A.B. and M.D. men returned for the affair. 
Twenty-eight States and two foreign countries were represented at the 1928 Class reunion. Over half of the *28 men living in the following States were presnt: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Kentucky, Kansas, Vermont, Georgia, Colorado, Texas, Massachusetts and Iowa. 
The report of the survey of the Class of 192S has received national recognition. The June 20, 1953 issue of America commented that the re­sults "do great credit to a great Catholic Uni­versity." Incidentally, that issue of America also contained an excellent letter on farm prices and prosperity by our classmate. BILL BROWN. Bill, who is assistant general attorney for Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co. in Milwaukee, also operates a farm in Epworth, Iowa. 
The Population Reference Bureau recently an­nounced that the Notre Dame Class of *28 had the highest birth rate of any of the Alumni of colleges with a graduating class of over 100 members in 1928. Our rate is 2.59 babies per alumnus compared with a national average of 1;97 for all 1928 classes surveyed. We average 
2.76 babies per married graduate while the na­tional average is 2.10. 
Those who took pictures of the reunion are urged to send them to our new President. FRANK CREADON, 194 Addison Road, River­side, Illinois. The movie pictures will be com­bined into one film for use at our 30 year re­imion and will be loaned to classmates for show­ing to *28 groups throughout the country. 
FATHER MARK FITZGERALD, C.S.C. is doing research in Europe this summer. He ex­pected to visit DR. JOE SULLIVAN at the American Embassy in London. 
CARL PETTERSCH has been teaching Amer­ican government and history at Danbury State Teachers College in Danbury, Connecticut, since 1947 and is now Chairman of the Social Science Department. Carl recently received a Ph.D. de­
- grec from Columbia University in the field of educational research. 
TOM BOV has been Chief Engineer on the Esso Shipping Company tankers since 1939. Tom reports that he has been going to sea for the past 20 years.

12. Pete adds that he has enrolled his son in Notre Damc*s 1953 Freshman Class. Congratu­lations, "Pete" and Mrs. Gallagher! 
BOB HAMILTON, as robust and rollicksome as ever, states that he will be on hand, barring schedule dilemmas, for our twenty-fifth shindig. Busy as supply manager of Pan-American Air­ways. Bob is planning a trip to Mexico at about the same time as our reunion. While in Mexico he plans to visit Classmate RALPH GARZA. He hopes also to contact Classmates CONNIE OCHOA and GEORGE PALOMINO. 
CHRISTIE FLANAGAN, our All-American halfback, from far-off Port Arthur, Texas, con­fides that he will be with us in June. He hopes to impart some of the fine points of the ancient game of golf, the Scottish not the African brand, to PAT CANNY and BOTTS CROWLEY. 
JOE MORRISSEY, our able representative on the Alumni Association's board of directors and Cincinnati business tycoon, whose two sons are students at Notre Dame, plans to be one of the early birds. Joe will supply WILLARD WAG­NER, our South Bend operative, with a helping hand. 
GEORGE A. SCHEUER, another South Bend representative, informs me that he is busy cor­raling all the late and lamented "Prof* Cooney's journalism majors for another memorable jour­nalists* luncheon on Saturday, June 13, in South Bend. George has written to everyone for whom he has an address. 
NORB SEIDENSTICKER'S ears should be burning. I have received many commendatory messages from classmates on the excellent job performed by Norb in compiling our Class's business and professional directory. Norb, treas­urer of the Chillicothe Paper Co.. spent a great deal of time and money in its compilation.

From LARRY STAUDER: 

Just when I have fine material from a squad one hundred strong they change the rules and limit me to about a dozen letters per issue. The March-April ALUMNUS bad space available for only about a third of the news that your secre­tary submitted. It seems, as you have prob­ably read elsewhere, that the Ave Maria Press is in process of expansion and is not in a posi­tion to print the ALUMNUS for several months. This issue is being printed downtown. 
Pure chance determined which contributions were used last time. I'm told that eventually each '29er who mailed in a questionnaire will see his news in print. We seem to be borrowing the "to be continued" technique of Saturday Evening Post and others. 
JOHN T. BURKE, 743 Main Street, Clinton, Massachusetts, has this to say about his varied career: 
"I'm vice-president of Dowd, Redficid and Johnstone, Inc., New York City, and John C. Dowd, Inc., Boston, Mass. In 1949 I opened my own advertising agency in Boston and on March 1, I9S2, I merged with the above two companies. At the present time I am serving in the capacity o£ president of the Notre Dame Alumni Club of Boston. During World War II I enlisted in the Navy as a Lieutenant, j.g., in March, 1941, and served until Christmas Eve, 1945. While in the Navy, I commanded a Spe­cial Projects Naval Unit located in Tcrre Haute, Indiana, where I had the pleasure of meeting with PROFESSOR REYNIERS." 
John Burke is married, plans to attend the reunion in 1954 and is a member of the fol­lowing organizations: Advertising Club of Bos­ton, the Engineers Club, the Naval Officers Association, the Naval Order of the United States, and the Corinthians Yacht Club. 
The many friends of LOUIS FRANCIS (for­merly Obligato) HANEY, 606 South Main Street, Newark, New York, attomey-at-law, will be glad to have his address. He would like to hear from his classmates, especially "TEX" DUPERIER of Beaumont and BOB TYLER of Kansas City. Missouri. Louis is the proud fa­ther of twelve-year-old twins. He plans to make 
the 1954 reunion.  
A  letter  from  the  REV.  JOSEPH  F.  
VOORDE,  C.S.C.,  in  Pakistan:  
Dear  Larry:  

"Your newsletter and questionnaire finally caught up with me after following me around the world. I hope this gets back to* you be­fore our 25th reunion. Wish I could be there. 
"I just returned from a visit home and on my arrival I got a new appointment. The first thing ARCHBISHOP GRANER says, is, you will have to do something about the church there. As soon as I see the church I know what he means. The church is too small. The roof is very low and it is always dark inside. In fact the floor is low too. Every so often in the monsoons the floods sweep through the church. In one of these floods a few years ago, the peo­ple rowed their boats right into church to hear Mass. The brick walls arc crumbling in places, and the doors are badly eaten by white ants. The sanctuary is a two by four addition bulg­ing out from one end of the building, the statues are peeping out between the rafters. 
El Paso held a dinner meeting on UND Night 
"What am I doing about it? I am starting a 'Raise the Roof* campaign for funds. I hope that by raising the roof the floor will come up with it and I will have a new church. My people here have collected S400. That is stretch­ing their poverty to the limit. I would hardly believe it, hut they need a church badly and need leads to sacrifice. We don't have such things as bingo £nd bazaars to help so all I can do is send out a call for help. 
"June 12th is the Feast of the Sacred Heart, the Patronal Feast of the church. I hope to have a lot of letters by that time with enough checks in them to be sure that I can go ahead with the work. I suppose the ALUMNUS is not the place to be making an appeal, but, you know, it gets to be second nature for a mis­sionary to put in a plug for his work any time he gets a chance. 
"Our Superior General, VERY REV. CHRIS­TOPHER J. O'TOOLE, C.S.C, left here in early March after his visitation of the Holy Cross Missionaries in Pakistan and India. While he was here we had the opening of the Cen­tenary celebrations of Holy Cross in the Mis­sions here, 1SS3-I953. Of the •29ers FATHER JOHN J. HARRINGTON, C.S.C, is doing a fine job as President of St. Gregory's College in Dacca, FATHERS WALTER R. MARKS, C.S.C, and CHARLES J. YOUNG, C.S.C. are in charge of Mission Stations among the Garos in Mymensingh District, and I am carrying on here. I am enclosing a picture of the Class of *29 in Pakistan as of January, 1953, which you might be able to use. 
"With best wishes and a hello to all," Yours, REV. JOSEPH F. VOORDE, C.S.C 
Thank you, Father, for your letter from Sacred Heart Church, Rangamatia, P. O. Baktarpur, Dist. Dacca, Pakistan. You men, examples of devotion, sacrifice and zeal, are a lift and an inspiration to us back in the States. May God bless and prosper your caure. We trust that you will receive the prayers and flnancial support of your classmates. Please write us soon. Father, on your progress.

Thank you. JOHN P. WALTZ, Canton, Ohio, daddy of Albert age 14 and Charleen age 7 for this newsy and welcome letter: 
"I hate to admit U but I have been quite lax in the matter of maintaining contact with the *29ers. My intentions have all been good but went no farther than that. Perhaps this will be the start of the turn of that new leaf, etc.

some real research. Dropped into the Engineer­ing Building several times but missed you. I hope DON PLUNKETT is back on a 100 per cent level. (Don is much, much improved and planning for '54.) I last saw FREDDIE MIL­LER, FRANK 'SPIKE' McADAMS, JIM BRADY and J. DORGAN. Will be back in June, *54." 
CARL P. WOLFRAM, 101 East 272nd, Euclid, Ohio, is with Thompson Products, Cleveland. He reports the fine family of Dona (wife) and Karyl 18, Charles 16, Donyl 15, Daryl 12, John 6 and Bill age 3 years. He sees "PAT" LAW­LESS and FATHER WINCHESTER end hopes to join with them at the reunion. 
BERNIE HUGGER, 8400 Blome Road. Cin­cinnati, is now Manager of Operations Ameri­can Airlines, Inc. He would like to hear from ROBERT TYLER in particular and the rest of the class in general. He will be making the reunion. 
Manager of Citrus Packing House is JOE E. KEEFE, Winter Haven, Florida, who reports a fine family of wife Grace Mary, Patrick 14, Jerome 12, Mary Jo 9, Brian 8, and Kathleen 5. 
Another family man is FRANCIS McANANEY of Tuckahoe, N. Y., attorney, father of nine. Mary Elizabeth 14, Sheila 13, Edward 11, Farch 9, Kathleen 8, Brian 6, Maureen 5, Kevin 3 and Joan 1^. (Bring a picture of the whole fam­ily, including parents, with you to the reunion, Francis. Seventy-four members of the Class of *28 had family pictures on display at Lyons Hall. It is too popular a feature to let die.) 
Still with managers, EMMETT McCABE, Manager, Advertising and Community Relations, Consolidated Aircraft Corp., San Diego, Calif., writes that he sees NORM HARTZER and AL WELGENBACH. Emmett was city club presi­dent there in 1950 and as such attended a con­ference of club presidents on the campus. He voices for us the pride we all have for the way our University officials and team represented our school in the press and on TV last fall. 
T. RUSSELL McGRATH. Providence, R. L, President, First Federal Savings and Loan Assn., was recently elected Vice-President of North­eastern Federal Savings League at their annual convention. Russell has one son, T. Russell, Jr. 
B. J. (PAT) O'LEARY, District Traffic Su­perintendent, Ohio Bell, at Zanesville, writes that son Jack, 21, who tamsferred from N. D. to Annapolis after his freshman year "graduates from the Naval Academy in June '54. If that date docs not conflict with the reunion I shall be contemplating the foam on Miller's in South Bend, otherwise, I shall be watching hira toss his cap in the air at Annapolis." 
Anesthesiology, which, I am sure, means little 
to you. "If you see Bob Cafcill, say hello for me." Thanks, *29ers. Keep the news coming in.

Judge of Probate Court, THOMAS C. MUR­PHY, of Wayne County, Michigan, writes that his family consists of wife Margaret S. and daughter Mary Ellen, 16. Tom last saw CHARLES BURKE, Davenport, Iowa, and WALTER J. McALOON, Pontiac. Michigan. He would like to hear from JOHN R. MUR­PHY, ARTHUR MILLER and FRED FLICK. Tom will be here for the reunion and suggests that an all-out effort be made to have everyone present. 
JAMES R. (SHORTY) NOWERY, President, Nowery Drilling Co., Shreveport, has a family of Jimmy 17, Dick 14 and Trisha 8. He recent­ly heard from KARL KASCHEWSKI with Standard Ore and Alloys Corp., 120 Wall Street, New York. Jim is president of the Notre Dame Club of Northern Louisiana. 
REV. MAURUS OHLIGSLAGER, O.S.B., 1312 Lincoln Avenue, Evansvtlle, Indiana, is Chaplain, Poor Clare Monastery. He would like to hear from Professors Burton and A. Confrey (My last information on them had them at Springfield. Illinois, Junior College, Father). He writes: 
"I attended the National Convention for Re­ligious at N. D. in August and enjoyed get­ting back to the Alma Mater immensely. Met many old friends. Saw my dear old Prof. Dr. William Cunningham, CSX . My esteem for 
N.D. grows with the years. Our Lady's Uni­versity is tops." 
Again from Cleveland ROCCO D. PERONE, Estimates Engineer, A. T. & T. writes as fol­lows: 
"Mary Elena is 13, Paulette 11, Denise 6 and Rocco D.. Jr., 2 years. I like to read the ALUMNUS to find out what the boys are doing —its the best contact I have with the old gang. FRANK METRAILLER called me by phone last week on a stopover to Hartford. He's running some small fabricating plant (1500 men) near Auburn, Indiana. The children and Agnes are fine. Mary Elena is graduating from St. Fhilo­mena's in June, Paulette is being confirmed. Rocco D., Jr., is wearing an N. D. monogramed sweater—N.D. *73—he is on his way. I've been singing in St. Philomena's choir; we are supposed to sing the High Mass on Sunday. Apparently they want to empty out the place in a hurry so the church will be cleared for Baptisms. Would like to see you all again for a good old fashioned session. I would like to hear from JOE GAIA and HOWARD DOLL." 
THOMAS F. FERRITER, 86 Atwater Ter­race, Springfield, Mass., has a family of wife Claire, son Tom, Jr., 5, and daughters Mary two and a half and Suzan 15 months. He writes as follows: 
"Your news about FRANCIS GUSHING re­sulted in my visiting him last Sunday, April 19, at the Westfield State Sanatorium. My visit was short but very enjoyable, and I intend to return soon. Francis is feeling quite well and hopes to make the reunion in 1954. JOE JACHYM, my old town chum from nearby West­field, had visited Francis soon after your letter arrived. 
"In January I drove to Boston to witness the Holy Cross-N. D. basketball game which, as you must know by now, was a thriller. My companions were several Holy Cross men so, needless to say, I needled them plenty on the way home. 
"Since I am ashamed to admit that I have not visited the campus since graduation, I assure you I am already planning for the reunion next June. 
"The Glee Club performed recently in Hart­ford, Conn. I missed this concert and since I was an old Glee Clubber myself this was a keen disappointment lessened in some degree by the appearance of th£ group on Ed Sullivan's Toast of the Town. 
"Last year we did get to the excellent concert given by the Band up at Smith College. Just about all the alumni in these parts were there, including JOHN SHEA of *Victory March* fame.

REUNION REGISTRANTS­JOSEPH A. ABBOTT and H. LOUIS STETTLER. 
Your secretary is sorry that a couple of issues of the ALUMNUS hit the street without the proper 1930 entry. From now on wc will have to pay closer attention to deadlines and get our copy filed early with JOHN CACKLEY. 
Members of our class have likely learned from other soiu-ces about the death of TOM CUN­NINGHAM. Ferbuary 6, 1953, and of BEN SCHWARTZ (Law grad., 1930), April 11, 1953. The Cunningham and Schwartz families are as­sured of the prayers of 1930 classmates. ALUM­NUS readers may want these addresses: Mrs. Thomas P. Cimningham, 25 West Locust Street, Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania; Mrs. Benjamin X. Schwartz, 5200 Arden Drive, Phoenix, Arizona. 
Had a note recently from JOHNNY MORAN. He had been missing his ND mail because of changed address (now 3230 Elmwood Ave., Ro­chester 18, N. Y.). He has occasional visits with WALT SCHOLAND and JOHN MCCAR­THY. He also stopped in once at the Batavia office of attorney JAMES W. MURRAY. The new Catholic high school at Batavia is called Notre Dame High (some of JIM MURRAY'S influence). 
A very welcome note from BERNIE CON­ROY came our way a while back. He expressed his shock over Tom Cunningham's death and spoke high praise of Tom's wonderful family. Tom's mother, Bemie wrote, still lives in New York. She has been a favorite of many ND profs for many years. Bemie attended the ND-Pittsburgh club retreat at St. Paul's Monastery in Pittsburgh during January, and there saw among others. HUGH GALLAGHER. JIM MORGAN, GEORGE KINGSLEY, EUGENE COYNE and BILL MAGARRALL. 
FATHER VINCE MOONEY was on campus as speaker for the Rockne Communion Break­fast. He was reminiscing about many events of the late 1920's that you men would recall quite vividly. 
The spring football game was the usual mag­net for many visiting alumni. BOB HOLMES was on hand to help out with arrangements for the game. Mr. "Bell Telephone" is always a welcome gentleman to have around. VERNON "BUCK" SLACK was out to size up the new crop of 60-minute ball players. Buck and his company (Oliver Corp.) recently emerged from some labor trouble, and Buck looks very healthy now and ready for a lot of golf. CLARENCE KOZAK was at the game, doing his usual stint on the field and manning the dressing room doors. JOE MORRISSEY was seen in many spots around the stadium, checking on the pro­gress of his own boy. Rockne Morrissey. DOC VAICHULIS was bouncing about, greeting everyone in his customary style. 
PAUL FARMER has a son graduating from the Commerce school here this Jime. 
TIM TOOMEY has written in a copple of times since our last report, and has mentioned seeing many Alumni in recent months. Here is Tim's full account: 
"At a meeting of the N. D. Club of N. Y.. I ran into ED ARTHUR still doing a fine job with Western Electric here in New York. Ed made one of his infrequent appearances at our local meetings. He informed me his two daugh­ters, Kathleen and Nancy, are going to school and he is grooming his son, Christopher, for a place on the varsity squad in 1968. 
"ART DENAHY and JOHNNY BURNS. '31. got' into a long discussion on ways and means to improve the racing breed. They are very

interested in a filly (four legged brand) which DR. JOHN PREECE, '31, has in training down Trenton, N. J., way. These two lads hope they have the Doc's colors back to back with some­thing real good in the near future. 
"Inquiries about my old Corby Hall share cropper, BILL WALSH, brought me this info. He is still with the Navy Dept. in a civilian capacity in Washington and doing a grand job. Good old Willie! 
"JOHNNY LAW, a bit grayer, but still as rugged as he was when he captained the great­est team ever to represent the School (in my book and in the book of thousands of others) is N. Y. representative for a Wisconsin brewery. 
"WARREN FOGEL appeared late and gave out no statements for the press. 
"TIM O'ROURKE, who does an outstanding job in eversfthing he undertakes for our local club, was chairman last fall of the 'those who didn't write for tickets to school and so much wanted to see the Penn game speciaL' The Trip on,the Special was a success due to TIM'S promotion. ('Some of the seats for the game were at the site of the Marciano-Walcott fight,' unquote O'ROURKE.) 
"JIM *RED' CURRY, '29, confirmed the sad news regarding the untimely passing of COL­ONEL JIM O'CONNOR, '29, Commander of National Airport in Washington. Jim, a real worker here in N. Y., re-entered the service after an outstanding record in World War II. 
-
 Many of his classmates attended the funeral services. 'Requiescat in pace.* Jim was a real 

N.
 D. man. A good friend of mine. 


"A breather, Dev, on my vacation, I visited JACK LAVELLE, '28, and JAKE JACKYM, 
•29. Both threw out the 'red rug* and you know what that means. 
"The first person I met at the Philly Club Rally last fall was none other than the late squire of Badin Hall, now in charge of opera­tions in Baltimore, GIL PENDERGAST. Gil, his I»vely wife, and my own date, had a most delightful session at the Bellevue Strafford. As the evening progressed FRED MILLER'S '29 product loosened the secrets. I learned Gil's wife and FATHER JIM RIZER'S sister, Har­riet, were classmates at Misericordia in Pa. 
"Gil said the Missus and himself attended -Mass at St. Mary, Star of the Sea, Fort Mon­
roe, Virginia, and completely forgot Father Jim 
was the assistant pastor there. (To all class­
mates, if you arc near Richmond, Va., pay 
Father Jim a visit.) 
"The Philadelphia Club did themselves right proud with their party. 
"JOE BOLAND. VINCE McMALLY, CHAR­LIE McKENNY and JOE MAXWELL, all of the class of '27, but well known to us 'frosh' in the good old days, gave a tremendous boost to the party to make one of the nicest affairs I have had the good fortune to attend. 
"Had a chat with HAROLD DUKE. He is slowly regaining his health after a long and costly siege and asked me to thank all who pulled for him when the chips were down. 
"CHARLIE CALLAHAN, athletic publicity director at school, took me aside to ask me if the 'Admiral' (O'MALLEY, of course) was in port. Pendergast had told me, as you did, that *E1 Capitan' was now drydocked at the Navy equivalent of the Pentagon and would arrive in time for the game. 
"OLD SALTY O'MALLEY was not seen dur­ing the weekend. He must have come up on a Navy landing barge. 
"I met up in Philadelphia with my good friend^ JOHN C. 'JACKSON' REDGATE and his charming wife, Mary. 'BUS' is back in harness after a long and hard battle in a Con­necticut sanitarium. He assured me the prayers and good wishes of all the N. D. boys helped him to forget some of bis pains. He is able to go to business each day, but has to be cau­tious. It was grand to see the Bridgeport Flash making statements again. 
"JOE ABBOTT, TIMOTHY L. (for Law­rence) CRONIN and DR. PHIL PROVISIERO represented the Paterson, N. J., Lodge. Ab­bott's son, Joe Jr., is a third year pre-med at St. Peter's in Jersey City; GEO. WINKLER doing a solo. 
Dean McCarthy spoke at the CinciBMoH Clab's UND Night observaiice. Bob Hughes was •omcd Man of the Year. 
"TOM SHEA, '29, an old rent payer together with Father Jim Rizer and myself at Grammcrcy Park in 1934, came down on the 'O'Rourke Special' all the way from Manchester, Connecti­cut. Thomas must have had to get out of the . crib about 4 a.m. to make the trip. He used to hate that! 
"CHUCK ROHR and PAT CANNY. '27, were in from Cleveland to get to the contest via O'Rourke's Flyer. Good Ole Pat. I never paid my locker fees. 
"JOHNNY BURNS and I had a small chat with the Master, Coach Frank Leahy, after the game. BURNS' request for an autograph brought a smile to the troubled face of the Coach. 
"We ran into PAT CONWAY, JOHN LAW, MICKEY McMAHON, '29. with his son, a stu­dent at school. The kid is bigger and better looking than his pater. Mick is located in New Orleans and promised to look me up on his next visit to New York. 
"JUDGE RICH BARBER, ED CUNNING­HAM and Johnny Bums of the next best class at School, '31, entertained in a real big way at the Warwick. BILL KELLY. *28, JOHN Mc-MANOMAN, '27, JIM MURRAY. '31, all gave out conflicting statements about things in gen­eral. 
"Others we ran across during the weekend were FRITZ WILSON, '27, and FRED WALL­NER. *S1. (from our old home town, Greenfield, Mass.). 
"JACK SAUNDERS, *3I, OLLIE SCHELL. *28, and a score of others greeted us. but un­fortunately we could not recall their names (Time and poor eyesight, fellas—not Miller's, slowed us down). 
"We saw ole 'KOZY' KOZAK on the side­lines helping out with the details and his per­-mance brought to mind the good old days in the 'Card Board Palace.* 
"BO RICHARDS. MOON MULLINS. DICK DONAGHUE. BUCKY O'CONNOR, JOHN FORSEE. TED ABEL, JOHN McMURRAY, JOE KELLEGHAN, ED REDMOND. TOM FROST, ED HALLORAN. CHICKEN DRIS­COLL. PATSY HASTINGS. JIM FRIEL, BOB WALSH..GEORGE VLK. DON and DAN SUL­LIVAN and the rest of that unconquerable crew — Father 'Mike* Mulcaire's 'Wildcats,' the champions of all inter-hall competition. Any challengers? No one ever beat us! 
"Dev, I hope I have covered the eastern sea­board satisfactorily. Late word from another Eastern operative states I am not the No. 1 At­lantic Seaboard bachelor.

REUNION REGISTRANTS­JOSEPH F. DEEB, JAMES T. DOYLE and JACK SAUNDERS. 
DEATHS Lumnus, A., class of 1931, suddenly. Mr. 
A. Lumnus, prominent Notre Dame grad­uate and popular campus figure, passed away suddenly from a prolonged siege of malNEWStrition. All letters of con­dolence should be sent to Jim Doyle for forwarding. 

The Notre Dame Club of Chicago again hon­ored the class of '31 by electing GILBERT SEAMAN to the presidency. AL STEPAN, president two years ago, launched a very for­ward and successful program for the club, and we are looking to Gil, together with his oflicers and Board of Governors, to give the club its most interesting and successful year. Among the '31 men there to support Gil were: BERT METZGER, JIM MULVANEY, WALTER CA­HILL, AL STEPAN, MARTIN DOWNEY, BILL LEAHY, JOHN FETZER, DON O'TOOLE, FRAN HOLLAND. NICK BOHL­ING, ED RYAN, GENE VALLEE and JIM DOYLE. Also sitting at our table were JACK McKEOWN and HOWARD PHALIN. 
FRANK DITTOE, Cleveland. Ohio, is with 

the Kelley Island Line and Transport Co., and 
sent the following excellent letter: 
"Dear Jim: 
"This will acknowledge your, recent card ask­ing for news for the class column in the Alum* 
-
 nus. It is nice to hear from you even though 

-
 the note was so short. 


."You should know that you need not ask how anyone is enjoying the '31 column since there is no' doubt that the only column to compare with it within my recollection was the one spear­headed by JACK SAUNDERS a few years ago. 
You are doing a swell job, and though I am sure you do not have enough people tell you so, I am equally sure it is appreciated. 
*'I am sorry I can't give you much news, per­sonal or otherwise, since 'there have been no drastic changes in the Dittoe household since I last talked to you and since I do not see as much of the local Notre Dame boys as I would like to. As a matter of fact I had hoped to run into you at some of the football games last fall and acquire a little information myself. How­ever, about the only classmates I saw at any of the four games I attended were JOE DEE6 from Grand Rapids. He and I arc building up quite a tradition in running into each other in various parts of the country without any prior arrangement. I also saw JOHN 'SARGE' RALEIGH at most of the games without pre­arrangement. He is, however, as you know, lo­cated in Cleveland as General Sales Manager of Cleveland Abrasives and I bump into him from time to time. 
"I generally see TOM REED of South Bend, who is manager of the Underwriters Adjustment Co., whenever I go to South Bend which is usually only during the football season. Tom has three boys and is on the verge of building a house at the intersection of Angela Blvd. and Notre Dame Ave., in order, I suppose, to be within walking distance of the Stadium. I was in Chicago briefly last fall and spent the eve­ning with LEO HODEL and his very charming wife, but I suppose you see them frequently so will make no further comments as to the Hodels. The above, brief as it is. about exhausts my fund of information as to *31 graduates, with the ex­ception of three widely scattered classmates about whom I can give a little news, although not much. BILL DOLAN, who started with us but did not finish—^you may remember him as a nephew of Father Dolan—is Sales Manager for one of the flour companies in Omaha and has called a couple of times over the past few years while stopping briefly in Cleveland. JOE DUNNE, originally from El Paso, Texas, is lo­cated in Deming, New Mexico, and has married since his release from naval service after the last war. Joe writes me a couple of lines on a Christmas card each year assuring me that he will write a long letter during the year giving full information as to his activities, but so far the information given you is all that I have. 
"I also had a surprise visit from OLLIE BENNETT some time back. Ollie was en route from Washington, D. C, to the state of Washington and called between planes. I was able to persuade him to stay over so I picked him up about noon at the airport and delivered him back at the same place at approximately the same time the next day. Ollie's wife and family are living in San Antonio, Texas, where he visited them from time to time since his duties as Hearing OfBcer for the Bureau of Indian Affairs kept htm constantly traveling all over the west and northwest with frequent trips to Washington. 
"As far as I am concerned, as I have indi­cated, there have been no substantial changes since I last talked to you. . I have been with the company on whose letterhead this is written since 1947 and am in charge of industrial rela­tions and do various specialized jobs in legal work. While the company is not a large one, by most standards it is large for its field and because of diversification and scattered loca­tions has contracts with approximately twelve unions including CIO, AFL and the Railroad Brotherhoods. It is for that reason that there is no lack of variety in the work. 
"The size of the family remains unchanged as it still consists of Rose and I and the five children (three boys and two girls ranging from 4 to 13 years of age). 
"That about covers it, Jim, and in closing I would like to give you my apologies for mak­ing it necessary for you to ask me to give you help with the column, as well as my sincere thanks for the job you arc doing which is of such great interest to all of us in keeping some sort of track of old classmates. Hope to see you before too long. 
Sincerely, FRANK DITTOE." 
Frank, if you have JOE DUNNE'S address please send it to me so I can drop him a line. 
ARNIE BIEBEL. Green Bay, Wisconsin, mentions NORB CHRISTMAN in his letter, so to keep the score even, Norb, why don't you send a letter for the next issue? 

Rev. Christopher O'Toele, C^.C, Superior GeHcral of the Ceagregcrtioa of Holy Cress, was guesr of honor of a Inncheoii ghre* by the Moaila, P. I.« Ctab. 
"Dear Jim: "Thanks for your recent card. Yes, I do en­joy the '31 column in the Alumnus. That is usually the first thing I look at when I receive the Alumnus because I'm always interested in getting information about the boys I knew when at Notre Dame. "Nothing very exciting has happened to me since I left Notre Dame. Like the majority of all Notre Dame men, I met the girl of my life, married her, and proceeded to settle down. I was married in 1935, and am now the proud father of three very nice children, Barbara Ann, 16 years old; Tommy, N. D. '62; and Ginny, 6 years old. 
"I haven't done as well as a few other Green Bay Notre Dame men who were in our class. For example, NORB CHRISTMAN is the fa­ther of five children, four girls and one boy, and EMMETT FLATLEY is the father of seven children, two girls and five boys. 
"Yes, I am going to look forward to the 25 year reunion in 1956. I certainly hope I will be able to make it. 
Regards, ARNIE BIEBEL." 
While watching television one Sunday night a few weeks ago I saw the program "Victory At Sea" and was surprised to see as director, our former classmate, M. CLAY ADAMS. Clay, formerly of Larchmont, New York, is with NBC. I sent him a letter at NBC and hope to have a reply for the next issue. CARL CRONIN stopped in the ofiice to talk about our 25 year reunion and do a little reminiscing about Fresh­man Hall days. 
As mentioned before, letters are always wel­come regardless of when anyone may have re­ceived my card, so SPIKE SULLIVAN, char­ter member of the Arcola-Mattoon Notre Dame Club, is now reinstated and member in good standing. 
"Dear Jim: "By way of getting you off my resolution's list. I now give out with that letter promised in November. It was good to see you both in South Bend and later in Chicago. 
"As you know, the TOM MONAHANS at­tended the Oklahoma game with us. On the same weekend we enjoyed some time with ED MURRAY whom we had last seen in Michigan when he was launching himself away from the University affairs in favor of the sporting goods field. This news later was available in an Alumnus item which featured a photograph of Murray suitable for display in the postoffice. JERRY CROWLEY is another whom we dis­tinctly recall as seeing at South Bend. 
"A few days later there ensued a cultural evening ^with CARL CRONIN and his very charming wife. In a Lake Shore restaurant for which Cronin evidently shills customers, we found JOHN CITRO'S brother operating as manager and proceeded to get John on the tele­phone at their other shop in order to pass the time of day. Allow me partly to balance my delay ii» writing by supplying the whereabouts of this strayed character who thus far has been unable to make any of the reunions or to keep in good touch. John is at 342 E. 108th St., Chicago, Commodore 4-0551. 
"In getting around the country a bit I do see a good many N. D. men but don't encotmter a high percentage of the 1931 crowd. As a matter of fact I am the only paid-up member in good standing of the Alumni Clubs of both Tulsa and Evansville. Should the 1953 Oklahoma game down here attract any of the class, I suppose it is early enough to be careless with sweeping invitations: it is therefore suggested that all comers first check in here so as to join in what­ever expedition to Norman is eventually ar­ranged. As Literary and Social Secretary of the class you must make a note of this. 
"Congratulations on your sterling performance in the above mentioned role. Everyone I know is sincerely appreciative of your productive ef­forts. With kindest wishes. 
As ever, 
SPIKE SULLIVAN." 
Jim Mulvaney was in New York recently and had dinner with DICK BARBER. JOHN BURNS and ED CUNNINGHAM. I can well imagine what was dished out that night. John, how about a letter to bring us up to date on the New York contingent? DON O'TOOLE recently paid a visit to our esteemed REV. C. BOURKE MOTSETT of Danville, Illinois, and reported very glowingly on him. 
ED LANGENFELD. our mink farm special­ist, is now operating a trout farm near New Holstein, Wisconsin. Ed sent along some fold­ers and they will ship live fish any distance. Some of you alibi fishermen might find it help­ful to place an order before starting on your next fishing trip. He writes: 
"Dear Jim: "Thanks for the card. It was nice hearing from you. As you know. I've stopped in to sec you at your office several times in the past few. years, but have yet to find you in. It's a good indication that you are really keeping busy. ­
"Usually when I get to Chicago it is only for a day, being only 3 ^ to 4 hours away by auto even at this time of the year, so^ I don't get too much time for visiting. It isn't too often that I get to see any Notre Dame men. Occasionally I see the ZWICKERS and DON SKALL of Appleton, and some of the other boys in the Fox River Valley. Several weeks ago I ran into RAY GLOUDEMAN'S brother who told me that Ray got himself married not too long ago and that he is doing well in their de­partment store. I intend to look up Ray one of these days. 
July-August, 1953 21 

"Last April wc had the Notre Dame Concert Band at New Holstcin. It was quite an honor for our little city, and several thousand people came to hear it. It was my pleasure to pre­sent the band with a trophy, which could hardly be anything else but a Holstein cow mounted on a carved state of Wisconsin base. The cow is now reposing contentedly in the music room at N. D. We had a Notre Dame section in the auditorium and quite a few alumni from She­boygan and the Fox Biver Valley attended with their families. 
"As you know from our student days, we operate a fur farm here at New Holstein. With zay brothers, we operate the largest mink ranch in the country. In addition, we have a trout farm about 20 miles south of here which we started about four years ago. Wc are supplying the big sports shows, and this week our Silver Moon Trout arc featured at the Chicago Sports Show at the Amphitheatre. We have public fishing at the trout farm, and many people come up from Milwaukee and Chicago all year round for the fun. Why don*t you try it some time? I can guarantee you a good mess of trout. 
**My family is growing up. My oldest daugh­ter is planning on attending Marquette next fall. My oldest son is a freshman at Campion where Frank Leahy, Jr.. is also a student. I had the pleasure of meeting Mrs. Leahy, Frank, Jr., and three of his charming sisters at Homecoming last fall. It was the morning after the Pittsburgh game. Another son is in the sixth grade. I have two little girls, one in kindergarten and the other joining her there next fall. 
**I*11 make it a point to look you up when I get to Chicago again. I presume you are still located in the same building on LaSalle St. By all means come up some time. I always hope to see some of you fellows at a football game at N. D. but I have yet to do so. I have two nephews at Notre Dame so I always have an added incentive to get down there several times each fall. 
"I always enjoy the '3X column, and it is the first thing I read in the Alumnus. I had a nice letter from PIERRE ANGERMIER. He has a son in high school who is bigger than he is. Whatever happened to JOE QUIGLEY, BILL FLAHAVEN and that other Irishman. FRANK O'NEIL, BILL O'BRIEN, HERB PERRY and the rest of that Gold Coast gang in Lyons? I get tc New York once in a while, and would enjoy looking up some of those Eastern boys. And sometime I would like to get together with you Chicago men when you have a smoker. Best wishes to you and Mrs. Doyle. 
ED LANGENFELD." 

About three months ago while down on the campus for the Loyola-Notre Dame basketball game I had occasion to visit DAN CLARK'S new restaurant on Michigan Street. Comparing this one to the Clark's we all remember from school days is like comparing the Morris Inn to Badin Hall. 
DICK CONNELLY is with Young & Rubi-cam, Inc., New York City, and writes about JULIAN ACERB and BOB PIGOTT. 
*'Dear Jim: 
"I hope I am not too late in getting this let­ter to you. It so happens I just returned from a business trip to the west coast and the card was at my home when I returned. I asstmie that when you asked that I drop you a letter you would like some information not only about my­self, but about some other fellows in our class. 
"At present I am with Young & Rubicam and have been for the past eight years. My present position is that of assistant promotion and pub­licity director for television and radio. You might be interested in the fact that some of the shows we have in the agency star Arthur God­frey, Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, William Bendix, Ken Murray, Alan Young, Charles Laughton, Eve Arden, Joan Davis and several others. 
"After finishing at Notre Dame in 1931 I worked as a reporter, feature writer and editor in the newspaper business for about nine years. I gave it up to join NBC in 1942 and came to this agency in 1945. I do quite a bit of travel­ing in my work here and occasionally run into some of our *31 classmates throughout the coim­try. Incidentally I have four children. Dick is a sophomore at N. D.; and three daughters, Maureen, Sheila and Mavoumeen. In fact, Jim, I was out at Notre Dame last week, having stopped over on my way back from the coast. Of all the hotels I have stayed in across the country, none can top the Morris Inn. 
"Just before Christmas I made a tour of the south and ran into JULIAN ACERS in New Orleans. He has had quite an experience since he left the campus many years ago. Several years after finishing school, he enlisted in the Marine Air Corps and was graduated a pilot just prior to Pearl Harbor. In fact, he was at Pearl Harbor and was later one of the heroes of the Battle of the Coral Sea. While in the Marines he served as a Squadron Leader in a dive bombing outBt and I understand his unit made one of the finest records of World War II. Early in the year he resigned and is now work­ing as an ofRce manager in New Orleans. He is married and has two children. Occasionally I hear from BOB PIGOTT who is in Seattle, and at last count had five children, or is it six? I was in Chicago for both the Republican and Democratic conventions and I ran into DICK O'DONNELL who is doing promotion for West­inghouse out of Pittsburgh. I may be in Chi­cago in the near future and I will keep your card and give you a ring. Please give my best to any of the *31 boys you run into. 
DICK CONNELLY.** 

I think BERNIE LENOUE in Seattle, whom I visited last fall, should have asked Bob over to his house that night. If you get a chance look up BOB PIGOTT and please send me his address as he is not on the Alumni mailing list.

Also, Bemie, I am awaiting that letter you promised me for the '31 column. 
GEORGE COSTELLO called recently and an­nounced the addition of a new baby boy. George now has 3 boys and 2 girls. JIM RICH, law-partner of VERN KNOX, was in town recently with his wife, and stopped by for lunch. Jim had a visit from JOHN MANLEY last summer. John was on his bi-yearly trip to Marshalltown, Iowa. 
AL ROCHE, Rochester, New York, sent the following very interesting letter mentioning sev­eral classmates. 
"Dear Jim: "I received your card several days ago. It was good to hear from a classmate from the midlands. I have followed with interest the recent growth of news in the Alumnus regarding the Class of *31. I always look forward to the column as it is my only source of information regarding the whereabouts and activities of many of the fellows I used to know. The task of Class Secretary is not easy and I appreciate the efforts you are making to obtain class news. Have often been tempted to write in a few notes, but am ashamed to say that this is my first effort. "I have been living in Rochester for nearly sixteen years. I have a family of three sons: Mickey, age 15; Jerry, age 11; and Tommy, age 
6. Mickey is a sophomore at Aquinas Institute and the younger two are in grammar school at Our Lady of Good Counsel. For a considerable period I have been working as a Probation Ex­aminer for the Division of Probation, New York State Department of Correction. I have an eight county area with headquarters in Rochester. Have always been engaged in this type of work since my student days and find it most interest­ing. Not too many of the local alumni belong to the class of '31. JOHN DORSCHEL is here and in recent months shifted from handling South Bend products (Studebaker) to a Buick agency. Just a few days ago saw a picture of John and Mrs. Dorschel enjoying a vacation spot in California. He looked hale and happy as 
usual. DR. CHARLES GUZZETTA is engaged in the practice of dentistry and is doing very well. He is much interested in the local semi­pro baseball loop. 
"Once in a while I run into BOB CALLA­HAN. He is an executive with the White Wire Works and I should like to have his formula for keeping slim and trim. It must be golf. Have not seen his old campus pal, Marty Dowling. in quite some time. I appreciated hearing at Christmas time from such classmates as JERRY LINN, WALT MURPHY, BOB MARK­LAND and BOB PRESCOTT. Murphy and Prescott live in nearby Livonia, N. Y., and are engaged in business there. On an occasional trek to Albany I am able to visit with LEN HORAN. Lcn was formerly with our Division but has been associated with the State Youth Commission in recent years. 
"I have often wondered what became of JIM 
COMEFORD. JERRY WIGGINS and AL 
HOWARD. Do you have any information about 
them or their addresses? In order to meet your 
deadline I have attempted this brief note. Should 
I see any of the lads in the near future or 
meet any of them in my state travels I shall 
be glad to bring you up to date on their activi­
ties. With best wishes to you and regards to 
any of the class you may be seeing, I am 
Sincerely, 
AL ROCHE." 

Can anyone help out on the address of AL HOWARD? 
I met BARNEY McGLONE who is with the Illinois Construction Co., and one of the people we talked about was BILL MORPHY who sent the following letter. 
"Dear Jim: "I am awfully sorry I did not answer your letter of February 17 before, but I have been out of town most of the time; you see, I am a Civil Engineer. "I have noticed that the '31 column has im­proved a great deal in the past few years. I do get the Alumnus from time to time and think you are doing a great job, Jim. "Yes, I do quite a bit of traveling around the country and over in the States, so I do get to see many of the Notre Dame crowd, even if they are not in the '31 class. I have visited 
PAUL GUSHING and PAUL ENRIGHT in Oakland, California; CLIFFORD FISHER, BARNEY McGLONE, HAROLD STELZER. SPIKE McADAMS, GENE VALLEE and many others in Chicago. In New York I have seen DAN HALPIN, JOE LENIHAN and others; in Mexico, very many of them such as JOHN 
P. BLEED and ED LA BARTHE and many from the northern part of Mexico. 
"I am planning to attend the silver anniver­sary reunion in 1956, and I wish you would be so nice as to arrange accommodations at the Morris Inn for all of us coming up for the week­end. 
"As • do many Notre Dame men, I too have quite a family, five boys and two girls; the eldest is a boy and is sixteen years old, the youngest is also a boy and is now two and a half months. My wife and I are very proud of them. 
"Please do call on us if you ever come into town; we will be very glad to say hello and show you around, Jim. 
Sincerely yours, GMO. ALVAREZ MORPHY." 

Over a year ago HAROLD STELZER promised a letter about Bill's visit to Chicago, but I had to write to Mexico City to get the dope direct from the feedbox. 
I saw TOM COUGHLIN. local municipal bond attorney. While Tom was visiting his son in a hospital where he underwent a minor opera­tion, he ran into JOHN COLLINS, *33, who was recuperating from a bad fall which resulted in several broken ribs. FRANCIS HANNE­BACH is Chief Engineer with American Steel Foundries, Hammond, Indiana. In addition to Al Howard, does anyone know the whereabouts of the following: BILL BROWN, Malone, New York.; RICHARD LACY and BILL FLAHA­VEN, Hartford, Connecticut; and FRANK O'NEIL, Fall River. Massachusetts? 
Many thanks to those of you who sent let­ters for this issue. Don't forget your letters of condolence. Please send in news of your club activities this summer and be sure to mention any '3Iers in attendance. Anyone planning on attending the Oklahoma-Notre Dame game early in September should first check in with ROB­ERT J. (SPIKE) SULLIVAN, 1605 National Bank of Tulsa Bldg., Tulsa, Oklahoma.

HONOR ROLL Another name ha" been added to the list of deceased classmates who are always in our prayers. JOSEPH A. KLEFEKER, A.B., of 116 Grant Street in Newark, N. Y., was the latest sad addition to that roster of requiem, the Alumni oiBce notified the class secretary recently. Our sympathy to Joe's family is cer­tainly extended through these paragraphs.

BALLOT BULLETIN 
Lest your over-paid reporter be scooped by and fired by City Editor JOHN CACKLEY of NDHQ, this late column insert must be added as protection. 
Cackley was present at the Chicago ND club's annual election when two '34 men were added to the board and staff at the Hotel Sherman. 
George Menard became a director and the '34 secretary added another secretary's job. (Ed. note: The Chicago Club couldn't have elected a better man for Secretary. If Ed Mansfield puts as much zip in them as he does in this class column everything will How as smooth as Fred Miller's beer. J.C.) 
George joins us in thanking the nominating committee and club for their confidence, we know. May we both now measure up. 
FATHER HESBURGH did one of his best speaking jobs that night, handling questions from a 200-man audience adroitly and frankly, and gaining fine news space from coast to coast for the club by announcing TERRY BREN­NAN'S backfield coach appointment. 
The more we see of Fathers Hesburgh and Joyce at Chicago ND affairs, the greater our pride in our school and its sparkling future. 
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN 
—thirty-four men in Chicagoland? Of some 35 to 40 in that area, few have been attending the splendid functions of the Chicago Club. Menard and this double-secretary are going to hound ye for UND night at the Drake April 11. We're lagging, men of '34, and the club needs more people.

One hundred and twenty-three was the grand total of representatives as the Class of 1938 staged its I5th reunion. For three days it was fun, and according to our FBI classmate, HAR­VEY FOSTER, everybody apparently arrived home safely. 
An early highlight was the arrival of Class President JOHN O'CONNOR, from Indiana­polis. Thanks to the work of another classmate, and incidentally the mayor of South Bend, JACK SCOTT, O'Connor, was met at Plymouth, 20 miles south, presented with a key to the city of South Bend, and then given a motorcycle escort to the steps of Morrissey Hall—reunion head­quarters. The roaring sirens accompanying O'Connor's arrival caused memhers of other. classes to wonder what was going on. In fact one curious soul remarked: "Who's coming, the President?" To this one of our classmates in the vicinity answered: "That's right, the presi­dent of the class of '38." 
The class dinner was held on Friday evening in the lounge of the Rockne Memorial. CHUCK SWEENEY was the master of ceremonies and the feature of a brief speaking program was a short talk by our esteemed classmate, the REV. THEODORE HESBURGH, C.S.C, President of Notre Dame. Foster, who is the honorary presi­dent of the Alumni Association, O'Connor, and the REV. JOE RACE, now a parish priest in Milwaukee, also spoke. 
On Saturday evening, following the general alumni dinner, a Class of '38 party was held, again in the Rockne lounge. Sweeney was once more the master of ceremonies and various prizes were awarded—such as, most children, ItAR-CELLUS BALL, nine. Ball is one of the South Bend contingent. NEVIN (BUDDY) McCOR-MICK, Livermore, Calif., the old right half­back, received a prize as the one who had trav­eled the furthest to make the affair. 
Mayor Scott was one of the Saturday speak­ers. He had been unable to make the Friday goings-on, being scheduled to speak to a Na­tional Yolmg Republican gathering in South Dakota that afternoon. The Republican gather­ing had been a two.day Thursday-Friday oet­togethcr. About JO days before, Scott had wired the Republican central committee, explaining about his class reunion, and could he be moved from the Friday speaking assignment to a simi­

lar spot on Thursday. The request was turned down. Seems that a fellow named Eisenhower had contracted for Thursday vocalizing. 
The concluding event on the weekend program was the most important, the class Mass for the deceased members and the celebrant w^as Father Race with the Morrissey chapel being used. 
Showing great stamina, Sunday evening, the area '38cr5 gathered at the home of classmate BILL GIBBONS for a buffet dinner. It was different than the Friday and Saturday evening meetings. The w^ivcs were present, and Sweeney was not the master of ceremonies. 
This almost seems like a Sweeney column for it should be pointed out that during the course of the weekend, at the Saturday noon Monogram Luncheon. Chuck was elected prcsi­dent of the National Monogram Club for the forthcoming year. Other '38crs to be honored were BILL (T-BONE) MAHONEY, who from his Phoenix, Ariz., residence wiU serve as West-em Vice-President, and JOHNNY MOIR was elected to the club's board of directors. At the luncheon it was announced that Moir had been named to the Helm's Foundation Basket­ball Hall of Fame- Also, at this gathering, RAY MEYER, coach of DcPaul. and Moir, assisted Athletic Director ED KRAUSE in ceremonies presenting an engraved clock to the university in the memory of the late GEORGE KEOGAN, Irish basketball coach, 1923-43. 
It is wrong to have waited to the end to men­tion this, but this coiner in behalf of all the class would like to extend sincere thanks and say congratulations for a wonderful job to DON FISHER, general chairman, who worked untir­ingly for many weeks with his committee to make the I5th reunion a success. 
THOMAS P.

If you can stand some very much delayed news, have a few items to report. I imagine the reunion will be covered adequately by JOHN CACKLEY. and I am personally very sorry not to have been in attendance. 
One of the long lost people came to light the other day. Our labor advisor mentioned that he had had a very enjoyable reunion with an old Marine buddy of his in Denver, one TOM BARRY. If Tom s=es this and has a few min­utes, I wish he would drop me a line just to renew old times. 
At a convention in Chicago I bumped into the old *'shot-puttef," BILL FAYMONVILLE. He is the newly appointed Canadian Agent for the Lynch Corporation and will take up residence in Toronto. 
This is a plea to some of the class officers or anyone to drop a line regarding conditions and changes that they know about. The lack of news of '39 is of epic proportions.

A handful of letters has turned up in the mails during April. One comes from BOB DOWD who is now living in Warrensville Heights, Ohio. 
Bob's letter contains some information about two other Bobs—Strieker and Stack. 
"Not too long ago, Noreen (Mrs. Dowd) and I shared a pleasant evening in a group that included BOB STRICKER who, incidentally, is looking fine despite a recent attack o£ polio. At the time* Bob was making plans for an ex­tended visit to Warm-Springs, Georgia. 
"BOB STACK was chairman of the N. D. Victory Dance after the Navy game. A ter­rific crowd attested to his promotional genius." 
Bob Dowd also points out that he received a Christmas card from the JOHN EDWIN MULLANEY'S—from Bedford Village. New York. In recent months Bob has seen ED MURRAY, FRANK McGRODER, AL GAUL and JOE MULLIGAN (from a distance). He's anxious to know something about MARTY SHEA (he's in Pittsburgh, Bob), CLYDE SCHMIDLE and HAL BERRES. 
The Dowd's have three "Bs". They are Bar­bara Jean. Bob Jr. and Billy. Setiior is with the Mueller Electric Co. of Cleveland, as Ac­countant-Office Manager. 
BILL BAUM writes to tell of a "Wranglers" group now operating in New York. Bill is not a *41cr but has written because so many of this branch Wranglers group graduated in 1941. Here they are—JOHN MacCAULEY and TOM Mc-GEE. AL PERRINE, JIM McFADDEN, TOM CARTY, CHUCK CUNNIFF, RALPH GERRA, BILL CLARK and MILTON WILLIAMS. These fellows are lawyers, doctors, salesmen— all joined together under the debate baimer they carried at Notre Dame. A good idea. 
JOHN McNAMARA. an M.D., writes that he graduated from the med school at St. Louis University and married Mary Jane Mason. They had a daughter during his internship at St- Vin­cent Hospital in Indianapolis. Then, 18 months in the Army. We'll skip a number of years and now announce that the McNaraaras arc the parents of seven—the last one, I am figjuring, arrived since I heard from John in April. 
-HARRY MCLAUGHLIN writes from Denver where he arrived in 1951. He stayed at a motel there for a while and had hardly settled when he discovered that next door was ED MA­LONEY. The McLaughlins have four sons and a daughter. His twin brother, Larry, has three girls and one boy. That's a switch. Lsrry, by the way, is in Royal Oak, the McLaughlin's birthplace. 
Harry is in the Air Force at Denver, stationed at the university teaching ROTC. 
He would like to know what happened to Charlie. Accuses Charlie of making a million and forgetting his poor friends. I can enlighten Harry on the subject—Charlie is a practicing attorney in his old home town of Butler, Penn­sylvania. It's not far from Pittsburgh, but I never see the guy either. I hear about him through his sister Ann—a graduate of St. Mary's whose husband is our obstetrician.

WATERS, another General Electric employee. A GE salesman in Jack's office gave him word of meeting TOM VINCENT who was once with GE but now is on his own as a consulting en­gineer. HERB SCHAFLY, formerly with GE, is a wheel in "Tele-Prompter, Inc." That's the outfit making gimmicks that help TV people to read their lines just as though they had memorized them. 
Jack also meets ANDY PINCKNEY occa­sionally. Andy is assistant district attorney in Albany County. 
DAN BRADLEY, "missing a bit of hair," writes from Detroit. Working for Shell Chemi­cal, he has been doing some barnstorming. The company had him in New York, on the West Coast, and in Boston. Now he's settled in De­troit. 
On the coast, Dan saw JOHN TORMEY who is doing work on guided missiles. 
In Detroit he runs into BOB CRONIN, RAY FITZGERALD, PAUL LILLIS and GEORGE WOLFE. 
Dan has three children—Kathleen, Patricia, and Dan, Jr. 
At the end of his sophomore year, PAT O'DONNELL left Notre Dame. Today, he is Rev. Patrick O'Donnell and is, as he says, battling the devil in and around Otway, Ohio. Father O'Donnell also works in the journalism field—on GLENMARY'S CHALLENGE, a "house organ" of the order. Father O'Donnell has seen BOB LEONARD in Cincinnati and BOB SASSE in Louisville. 
A short note from BERNIE JAEGER points out that he has two children and is with the 
U. S. Naval Ordnance Test Branch at Inyo­kcm, China Lake, California. His job—guided missiles and rocket research.

"JOHN Q. O'CONNELL of the class of '42 was ordained to the Priesthood in the Congre­gation of the Mission at the Vinccntian Semi­nary, St. Mary's of the Barrens, Perryvillc, Mis­souri, on the 7th of June. The ceremony was performed by the Most Rev. James Cody, Auxil­iary Bishop of St. Louis. 
JOHN R. MALONE is an assistant professor of Business Administration and Marketing on the College of Commerce faculty at Notre Dame, His address is 324 Preston Drive, McKinley Terrace, South Bend, Ind. 
BILL HICKEY, the bouncing steel man from Chicago, is just back from a busy vacation in Acapuico, Mexico, which he recommends as the place to visit when you want to vacation in king style. While there he caught 12 sail fish, including one weighing in at 120 pounds! 
When the American Petroleum Institute met a few weeks ago in Chicago, Bill had a get-together with LARRY KELLY, now a Houston oil-man. Bill also reported that JERRY HACK vacationed recently in California, and he too is trying to regain the normal way of doing things back at Pullman Trust & Savings Bank in Chi­cago. Jerry heads the Communications-Storage­Warehouse-Purchasing activities of that institu­tion and its affiliate banks. 
Bill and ROBERT EMMETT WRIGHT gave us a report on the large number of '42-ers pres­ent at the Notre Dame Club's Valentine's Dance at the Casino Club in Chicago. LEO PAUL LEE, FRANK O'DOWD, DON HOGAN, LEO LANIGAN. JIM CONWAY, JERRY HACK, BILL MARSHALL were among those present .. . a collection so strong you'd have figured it was a class Reunion. Emmctt, by the way, is secretary of the Chicago Notre Dame Club. 
All the above were there with their charm­ing spouses, that is except LEO LANIGAN. 
That bachelor was there with an attractive girl friend. The Chicago members of our class arc sorry to report the departure of WALT Mc-COURT back to the call of Goodyear in Akron, Ohio. Enunett also says that LEO LEE has moved into a recently completed home in sub­urban Glenview, Illinois, and is a neighbor of JIM McNULTY. Don Hogan is back from Capistrano, California, but he didn't get to see the return of the swallows! 
ANDY GORKA came into Pullman Bank in Chicago a few days ago, and he's once again a civilian. He was an Electronics Officer in the Pacific Fleet (second tour of duty) on Ad­miral Arthur Radford's staff. He's glad to get back into the meat business on the South Side. 
AL ANASTASIA has returned to his native New York following a fine promotion with the WALL STREET JOURNAL. He was formerly assistant advertising manager of the Chicago Edition, but New York called and back he went. The Midwest regained another, though, with the return to Swift's of JACK DINGES who had been with one of its subsidiaries in Boston. Our classmate, ED GRIESEDICK, came into the news of the recent purchase of the St. Louis Cardinals by a rival brewing com­pany. It is Ed's family which is sponsoring broadcasts of Cardinal home games. The battle of the brews! 
BUD McCABE, who comes up occasionally from Iowa, was a guest of TOM NASH at Olympia Fields Country Club in Chicago. Bud is one of those 70 shooters who makes Tom scratch to earn a couple of nickels. 
I had lunch one day not so long ago with TOM POWERS, now back at the City Desk of the Chicago TRIBUNE after his second sojourn into the Army. He gets to sec PAUL NEVILLE, Managing Editor of the South Bend TRIBUNE, . now and then and word gets back that Paul is doing right well not far from the Golden Dome. With us sharing reports was Insurance-man DON FIGEL, who incidentally was just recently elected Secretary of the St. Agnes Church Holy Name Society. 
It's mighty interesting to see how members of our class are really stepping into civic, church and business affairs around the country. And by the way, let's have a roundup of news from fellows outside the Chicago area. We need some chatter. Remember, if it's news, write Scoop. If it's about you, it IS news!

For the first time in five years • there is an abundance of letters—and they can't be usedl Because, like cigarettes. The Alumnus is being issued in "regular' and "king size." Space limitations were prompted because the Alumntis was squeezed from the production schedule of the Ave Maria Press. This edition is to be one of the smaller editions. And since all the letters dealt with the Reunion plans, they would hardly be topical these few weeks after the 10-year Reunion weekend. Detailed information about the Reunion will appear .in the September issue of the Alumnus. 
The last issue of the Alumnus stated in "SCOOP" SCANLAN'S 1942 Class Column that our own (not 1942's) AMBROSE F. "BUD" DUDLEY had been appointed Director of Ath­letics at Villanova (Pennsylvania) College. The national edition recently carried a nice story about Bud's appointment. Congratulations and best wishes for your success. Bud. 
During the weeks immediately prior to the Reunion I had word that several of the class were looking forward to the big event. JERRY KLYN wrote from Mentor, Ohio; JIM DOW­NEY from West Palm Beach, Florida; JOHN BRESLIN from South Bend; ED HANRAHAN and HOWARD MARLOW from Chicago; BILL MIDDENDORF from Fort Wayne: ED RONEY from Detroit; and BOB HALLEIN from Cleve­land. 
REUNIQN i 
George Bariscillo 
515 Fifth Avenue 
Bradley Beach, N. J. 

June and reunion time once again! Which reminds us that one year hence at this time we *44ers will be converging on ND for our once-every-5-years get-together. It has been suggested before, and bears repeating, that you begin making your long range reunion plans NOW, so that YOU will surely be among the rcunion­ites come June, *54. Your scribe plans to be at ND for the class secretaries* conference on June 11th and will "scout" this year's reunion­ing classes for ideas, etc. Also, am planntttg a meeting with Class "Prexy" DICK DOER­MER to settle the initial details for getting the proverbial ball rolling. May I solicit your recommendations for making our reunion in '54 "the greatest." Drop me a line immediately so I can pass along the suggestions via the Sep­tember ALUMNUS. 
Speaking of suggestions, a welcome communi­que was received from secretary-emeritus BILL TALBOT recently, lamenting the fact that our M4 class did not have a yearbook and suggest­ing "it's not too late to recoup something of our times together.*' How 'bout a '44 DOME. not as extravagant as the usual yearbook, but something that would preserve in printed and pictorial form highlights from our collegiate years? 
Good idea! Contents of such a publication might include the following, suggested by Bill: "1- Hall pictures, taken of us as Juniors for the '43 DOME; "2. A resume of pictures from the SCHOLAS­TIC during our 3-plus years; 
"3. A resume of text of 2 or 3 pages, com­posed also from the SCHOLASTIC, hitting the highlights of our years on campus (the de­feat of the Iowa Seahawks, the premiere of "Knute Kockne, AU American," the declaration of war, etc.)* 
"4. The usual section of personal photos with brief biogs, with this exception: The photo­graphs would be those as the fellows appear in 1954, 10 years after, and the biog would be limited to the following: 
Name, degree, and year. Address. Business and business address, and position. Period of military service, and branch, and 
area. 
Marital and parental situation. 
SEMI-ANNUAL REPORT . . . 
"S. A section of post-graduation photographs: pictures taken at Alumni club meetings, at meet­ings with classmates overseas, of the *49 re­union, of the *S4 reunion, and family photo­graphs." 
He suggests, also, an alternative method: 
"There is another method: simply compile a little photographic album of pictures follow­ing the 10th reunion, and sell at cost. But this would omit a lot of fellows, and it does not really tell the story of us at Notre Dame, as we would like to remember it." 
Your reaction to the above would be appre­ciated. 

NEWS AND WHAT-NOTS . . . AUSTIN JONES, JOHN DUFFY. "BLACK JOHN" MURPHY and BILL TALBOT faith­ful attendants at ND Club of New York meet­ings . . . DUFFY recently elected to Board of Governors of N. Y. Club . . . GUIDO ALEX­ANDER operating Palm Gardens nite club in Cincinnati and "booking the best acts in the country" . . . Guido is married and the papa of two . . .

Amy Elizabeth, for the VINCENT BITTERS on April 21st . . . Sincere sympathy to DR. JOHN UTZ on the loss of his dad . . . John is with the National Institute of Health at Bethesda, Maryland. 
One of the *44s most faithful correspondents (and quite often the "rescuer" of this column with news), BOB MARTINA, came through again with a detailed accounting: 
Back in the States and on inactive duty after 8*,^ years of service in the Navy, Bob and fam­ily have settled in his home to^vn of Denver (1860 W. Mississippi Avenue). He writes that he's planning on setting up a TV shop and speaks of "long range plans of making the re­union next year." Further reports his campus buddy. ED "SOCK" SOCHALSKI, is expecting a third addition to his family; that DAN TOM­CIK is now located in Buchanan, Michigan, and that GEORGE CHARTERS has been recalled and is now stationed with the Signal Corps at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. 
DON'T FORGET . . .

2.

THANKS FOR THE DUES: Since the last ALUMNUS column, in which we printed the names of paid up class mem­bers, additional men have sent in their dues. There's still quite a few who have not paid the Si (even some of the class officers!!). This is surprising in view of the concentrated effort that has gone into the program. At any rate, thanks a lot to the additional men listed below for their vote of confidence in our work: 
WELTON ABELL. DICK AMES. BILL AN­DERSON. MATHEW BAJOREK. HAROLD BERLINER, JIM BERSBACH. BOB BLACK­HURST, JOHN BOWEN. JR., JOHN CON­NELLY (REV. MR.). CHARLES CROWN, FRANK CURRAN. JIM DONNELLY, JR., JOHN HOSBIEN, GEORGE JESCHKE, JR., JOHN KINNEY, JR., BOB LUKE, BROCK LYNCH, JOHNNY MACK, JR.. ED MUL­CAIR, ROBERT PELTON, C.S.C., CHARLES POWERS. HARRY RYAN, EMMET SHEE­RAN. 

AU we can say is that some of you who have not paid as yet as either very lazy or very stubborn. We hope you, who have neglected our every plea, decide to cooperate. This work isn't easy, and you certainly arc making the job tougher. Mail your Si to RAY BADDOUR, 471 Beacon Street. Boston. Massachusetts, right away. Do it while it's gnawing away at your conscience!! 
LETTERS FROM DEPARTMENT: From MRS. RAYMOND C. KOPITUK: "Since I have to do most of the family cor­respondence, I thought I'd be the one to let you know that Ray didn't get one of your cards to fill out this year. Most important is the fact that our regular address is 611 W. Price Street, Linden, New Jersey. The other address you have is only a summer one." From JOE HAGGAR: "Thank you for your letter of recent date, and I too am very sorry that you were unable to make your trip to the Coast and stop by in Dallas to visit with me. I am planning very definitely to be on the cam­pus in June of '55, and if something doesn't happen I will be there to see you then. I hope to get up to school for a football game this coming fall, but that, too, depends on circum­stances.

"I have heard the good nevrs about BILL BEVINGTON and had correspondence with him. . I know he is very happy in his Priesthood vo­cation and will make a very wonderful priest. With best regards for all." 
From JOHN D. BOWEN, JR.: "Sorry about taking so long to send the $1. I would like to take this opportunity to give you a personal slap on the back for the fine job you are doing as class secretary. Your perseverance in track­ing one down qualifies you for the F.B.I. Con­gratulations." . 
From WILLIAM M. ANDERSON'S father: "I received your letter to Bill, and forwarded it to him in Korea. I am attaching the class dues to this note for Bill. Kindest regards." (Thank you very much, Mr. Anderson. Please ask Bill to send me a note, or send me his military address so I can write him. Best re­gards, Al.) 
From HAROLD BERLINER: "Just a note to send my dollar in (but please keep sending me the collection letters, because I want to see just how far your ingeniuty carries you). 
"Do you know GEORGE DESPOT'S address? Why not put in the column what you are doing now? As you can see. I'm practicing• law, al­though I've still got the publishing business too." (George's address is 6041 Gilbert Drive, Shreveport, Louisiana. As for me. I am doing engineering-technical writing for the Sperry Gyroscope Company, mostly on classified gov­ernment armament. Thanks for your note, Harry. Best regards. Al.) 
From ROBERT T. BLACKHURST: "I should have graduated in 1943. but because of the late world struggle, didn't make the grade until 1945. Because of this bit of confusion, I've never really belonged to any class. 

"After leaving N. D.. I graduated from the Michigan Medical School, interned in Okla­homa City, took post graduate courses at Har­vard, and had three years' residency at Roches­ter and the University of Louisville. At pres­ent I am a medical specialist (ophtanalmolbgist) with an attractive wife, a small boy. and smaller girl. We manage to send the Alumni Fund S50.00 each year and really enjoy one or two games each Fall. 
"At present, I am on the brink of a trip to Korea for Uncle Sam so may not be writing again for a couple of years. Best regards." 
From W. RALPH ABELL: "Enclosed find 

51.00 cash. Would have sent check but left book at home. Sure you can understand! As you know, I returned from Korea and the 1st Marine Division 16 months ago. Was married shortly thereafter and now have a fine red­headed boy named Scott Welton. Returned to my old job as Advertising Manager for the 
Barry-Wehmiller  Machinery  Company.  We  
manufacture  brewery machines.  Nice  job!  Pub­ 
lenty  of  suds!  

"Must close as am leaving town this morning and want to get my desk cleaned up." 
From JOHN M. GUTHRIE: "I'm going to ask you to do one little favor for me. that is to forward the enclosed dollar to the gentleman in charge of the collections. 
July-August, 1953 
"As you know, I'm still in the mid-west, and it looks to be pretty permanent. Last time I wrote to you I was in the Navy, but obviously am now out. Married the girl from Philly that I told you about. We have a 9 months old son, John Merlin III, who luckily for him is a lot better looking than his old man. Have been here for over a year, and am a member of the Green Bay Club. Wc are having Universal Notre Dame night this coming Monday, and I sm to forego office hours and attend. Have heard practically nothing from any of the fel­lows I knew. RAY MORGAN recently stopped off for a chat with my folks in South Bend. Would love to know where CHUCK LESLIE is now. Last I heard of him he was taking off for Washington for some more training in Radi­ology. Will write when I have a little more to say." 

From JIM BERSBACH: "Enclosed is my dues—Sl.OO, which should swell the fund im­measureably, Tm sure. To bring you and the rest of the gang up to date, after leaving school in January of 1943 and spending two and a half years in the Air Corps, I finished up at the Hotel Administration School at Cornell U. After working at several hotels. I am now associated with the Chicago Convention Bureau as a Spe­cial Representative. I married after graduation and now have a girl 3, Wendy, twin boys, 8 months old, Mark and Scott, and one other on the way. Saw Ace Dreis last summer and have bumped into ED HOBAN. TOM MacDONAL of the Sheraton Hotel's sales staff I see quite regularly. Also JOE CONERTY of Woodstock, Illinois, gets into town every so often. If you are passing through the 'Windy City* be sure to give me a call." 
From DICK AMES: "Yes, I am still as lazy as in the Scholastic days. I put more hours of work in, but I don't get much more accom­plished. Thanks a lot for your several com­munications, direct and indirect. I really would like to be a more active cog in the Alumni or­ganization, but up to now, I've been swamped with the daily routine. Right now I've just entered a new phase of the insurance business in California, and it's beeping me busier than I ever thought possible. I get home to dinner about three times a week, and have only scat­tered hours through the week when I am really free to think about anything but the job. But this pace won't go on forever, and I want to be remembered as a guy to count on for coopera­tion in the future. Enclosed is one buck. Treat JIM ARMSTRONG to a drink for me. With warmest personal regards." 
From FRANCIS E. MALONE: "I can't say that a broken arm has kept me from writing sooner because I am sure you would never be­lieve it has taken seven years to heal. I guess my intentions have always been good but they just haven't up until now really made me sit down to write you. To fill you in on the years since Notre Dame I will start from the begin­ning, which is of course the best thing to do. After leaving school I went to work for the Electric Auto Lite Co. here in Toledo and as you can tell from this paper I have stayed put. The really important part of my life of course is the fact that I married Sheila Donovan who is the girl I went with while at Notre Dame. She went to St. Mary's at that time so you might remember her. The Lord has been very good to us and we have a daughter and three sons. Their names, according to age, are Pa­mela, Peter, David, and Richard. They are all 100% American children all the way from candy to television to cowboy outfits. We are build* ing a new home which should be completed the early part of March. My new address will be 3237 Aldringham, Toledo. I will of course send the new address to school when we move. Please keep your news letters coming as it is nice to know what is happening to the members of our class." (Best regards. Bud. And good luck on your new home. Nice to hear of such a swell family. Write again, Al.) 
From FRANK J. CURRAN: "Thanks for the card. Lost it somewhere along the line, so will say 'hello' on this 'borrowed' hospital stationery. Since last writing, finally received my M.D. from Columbia University last June. After a short vacation with my wife in northern New York, journeyed here to Washington, D. C-, to begin a year's internship at Walter Reed Army Hospital as a 1st Lt. We acquired a nice apartment from a pessimistic Democrat who left early, and would certainly like a call from any of my old friends at N. D. Number: Enc. 2-7814 since as yet wc are not in the good book. Except for a very nice week in Jamaica over New Year's and fighting the huge crowd at the Inaugration Ball, I find most of my time spent here at the hospital." 
From EMMET T. SHEERAN: "Glad to re­ceive your recent letter. If you are short on statistics—here are some: 
"(1) I am the proud father of four wonder­ful children, MaryAnn, MICHAEL, Kathryn and Nancy. 
"(2) Am a Capt. in the medical corps re­serve on active duty with the Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB." 
LETTERS TO RAY BADDOUR: 
From GEORGE J. JESCHKE. Jr.: "Dear Ray, It's about time I sat down and dropped a few words to my friend from North Carolina, I hope everything is fine with you and that you're still as much fun as ever. 
"Since you last saw or heard from me, quite a few nice things have happened. In 1951 I married a girl from my home town and we now have a big boy of 16 months. After I gradu­ated in I94S, I was on the Aircraft carrier, 
F. D. Rooseveltt for one year. From 1946 to 1947 I was a powder metallurgist in Chicago. Not finding the work I desired most, I finally went in business with my father. 
"JOHN HOSBEIN, my roommate back at 

N. D., was called back in the Navy last June. It sure was a bad break for John as he was helping his Dad in business. I haven't seen too many of our classmates lately, and sure do miss the pleasure. How is your cousin SAM RIZK doing? I often think of the fun we used to have in Zahm Hall back in '42. Also wonder how FRANK MILLER, DICK SAYRES. BY MAR­TIN, and the rest are these days. Please write when you get an opportunity. Sorry about the delay in dues. If there's anything more I can do, please let me know." (George, please read your roomie's letter down the column a few letters away. Best regards, Al.) 
From CHARLES W. POWERS: "Dear Ray. Enclosed is my check for dues so earnestly sought by our secretary AL LE5MEZ. I cer­tainly hope that a large number of the others cooperate with you and Al in your preliminary efforts to get us off to a 'bang-up' reunion in 1955. You have a proverbial 'pat on the back* for your efforts and my promise to lend what­ever assistance I can from this end." 
From EDWARD G. MULCAIR: "Dear Ray. In reading AL LESMEZ' circular letter to the grads of '45. I find I am indebted to you for Si. Please find same enclosed. Now that this chore is done, my next step is to write Al and let him know what happened to me since 1945. No sir, I haven't written once but hope to make up for it during the present year." 
From FRANK J. CURRAN (M.D.): "Dear Ray. Al said, *Pay your dues.' So here you are. My new address is 2730 Wisconsin Ave­nue, N.W., Washington 7, D. C." 
From LT. JOHN W. HOSBEIN (USNR): "Dear Ray. Sufficient reminding on the part of AL LESMEZ impels me to send my dues, which I enclose. As my address reveals. Uncle glommed onto my person again. It is turning out rather well and has taken on the aspects of a 2-ycar vacation in San Diego. The duty is very absorbing and consists of several of the duties of an Engineering Specialist applied to ship repair. The outfit is still in the growing stage. I arrived here to commence my two years a year ago in Jtme. On release, I have no plans, but it is distant enough that not much thought is spent on it. 
"I saw Jack Jeschke out here last summer —he was doing something for Convair— farmed out to them from the Johns . Hopkins Physics Lab. I made it home for the holidays, but failed to look any of the Chicago lads up due to extensive holiday action. I am not mar­ried and nothing is in prospect yet. But I did meet the greatest gal ever the last night I was home. Swell luck, eh? Well, there is always the U. S. Mail. 
"I expect you spend a lot of your time in the upper reaches of Chem Eng theory these days. How is it going at M. I. T.? You were al­ways so 'stupid* at N. D., Ray. My best recollection is that you missed Maxima by a few digits in the 2nd decimal place. Well, good 
luck to you. The same goes for Al—^you might forward this to him. I wish more of the lads would come through: By, Miller, Haggar, Cliff, ct al. But I am as guilty as anybody. All hands on active duty are requested to phone me at the Naval Station, extension 717, if their ships ever hit San Diego. Best regards." 
From HARRY J. RYAN: "Dear Ray. A short time ago I received a letter from AL LESMEZ stating that our class has been rather lax in sending in our dues. Being short in stature as well as memory, I am unable to remember whether or not I sent mine in previously or not. 
"1 am enclosing Si with this letter and if you do find that I had previously paid my dues, please just add this to the kitty rather than returning it. I sincerely hope that everything is fine with you and I am looking forward to seeing you at the next class reunion in 1955.'* 
- From JOHN J. CONNELLY (REV. MR.): "Dear Ray. I certainly was glad to receive the class news report sometime ago. This is the first opportunity Tvc had to answer. Too, I want to pay my class dues. 
"I was listed erroneously in the class of '43, so after getting a couple of their class papers, I insisted with the Alumni Office to straighten their records. I graduated in February *45. I finally got the news letter from AL LESMEZ and everything is straightened out. 
"I am a Deacon now, and I'll be ordained this coming May 30 at 9 a.m. in St. Mary's-Cathedral, Trenton, New Jersey. My First Sol­emn Mass is on May 31 at 11 a.m. in the Church of the Transfiguration in Philadelphia—my home town. Needless to say, all the members of the class of *4S are more than welcome to my Or­dination and First Mass. After that time, I hope to become active with the N. D. Alumni (especially *45) of Trenton, New Jersey. Any help that I can give in the future, Ray, you can be sure that I'll be only too overjoyed. I 

will.send you the parish I'm stationed at some­time in June so as to keep your records straight. 
"Lots of luck in your work and especially in preparing for the 10-year reunion. May God bless you and your work. And don't forget me in your prayers during this time preceding Or­dination."
