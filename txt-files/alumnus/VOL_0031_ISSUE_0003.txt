ALUMNI CLUBS 
(Ed. Note: Alumni Secretary James E. Arm­
strong covered club meetings in San Francisco, 
Los Angeles. San Dieco, Phoenix and Kansas 
City. His summary of "these events follows. 
JC). 
Using the "octave" theory of Universal Notre Dame Night, it was my pleasure to meet with the Northern California Club on April 8; the Los Angeles Club on April 13; the San Diego Club on April 14; the Phoenix Club on April 16, and the Kansas City Club on April IS. 
Dean Joseph O'Meara Jr. gave me a big start by joining me in San Francisco, and explaining his splendid program in the College of Law to the Club. And Dr. James Culliton closed the trip with a big assist in Kansas City by outlin­ing his program for administrators in the Col­lege of Commerce. 
Of general interest to me was the presence at all five meetings of the "auxiliary"—the wives of the alumni, and the mothers of present stu­dents, definitely organized in a few places, deep­ly interested in all. 
Also of general interest on the trip was the evidence of the active and very constructive participation by young alumni. Top administra­tion in the larger Clubs tends to be in the hands of experienced alumni, but there are young officers in all the Clubs and a universal effort to enlist the activity of the recent graduates. Some administrations are entirely from the re­cent years. 
By contrast with my last visit, in 1937, to the Coast, both San Francisco, under President BOB TARVER, M9, and Los Angeles under President CHARLES LYNCH, '28, showed remarkable growth, not only in numbers, but in the nature of the program of the Club. Tarver was suc­ceeded by WARD McMULLEN, '25. as the new president for the Northern California area, which, like Los Angeles, is using the suburban, area meetings to supplement the more difficult and expensive general central meetings in the city. 
San Diego, where JACK McCLAREN, *29. succeeded WIN DAY, *36, as president,, showed the rapid growth and splendid spirit of a young Club, blessed with consistently good leader­ship, a solid membership interest, and an inter­esting transient alumni population in the neigh­boring service bases. Navy and Marine particu­larly. 
JOHN O'MALLEY, '36, retiring president of the Phoenix Club, succeeded by REGIS LYN­SKEY, '29, was a most gracious and efficient host, personally and officially. A luncheon at the Arizona Club spotlighted the Foundation and Club techniques, with the welcome assistance of REV. JOHN J. BURKE, C. S. C. former vice-president of business affairs, temporarily a health-seeker in Phoenix. Here, as everywhere, the Club itself has grown in numbers, has en­listed the interest and activity of the ladies, and the parents of students (stimulated by a most active undergraduate Arizona Club at Notre Dame). 
Kansas City, the last stop, under retiring pres­ident RICHARD BOWES, '38. showed the most intensive progress of its long and interesting history. Dick, who was succeeded by BOB METZLER, '44, gave the Club some of his Harvsrd Business Administration methods to supplement his intense Notre Dame spirit, and the combination has created a strong basic Club, a powerful new ladies* auxiliary, and a recog­nized and prominent civic organization which has contributed to such commendable enter­prises as blood bank and polio. 
It would be impossible here to list the friends seen; the many old and new officers of the Clubs and the Foundation Committees, whose efforts have been vital in the whole pattern; and the tctive membership who increasingly under­stand the program of Notre Dame as it is mir_ rored in the "little Notre Dame" that is each Club; the enriching quality that has come to each Club as the ladies have given to each the reflected glow of the Lady on the Dome; and the parents, whose sons are the Club members of tomorrow. 
And everywhere, most encouragingly, was the evidence that Notre Dame men and their fam­ilies not only know the story of Notre Dame, but are spreading tt most effectively in the wid­ening circles of Catholic and civic interest. 
JIM ARMSTRONG 

"Trigger" Jim Armstrong toured the west during the octovs of UND Night and one of his stop­overs was Phoenix. The sombrero was a gift of the club and not necessarily a part of his 'accoutrement* for after-dinner speaking. 

Baltimore 
The Baltimore Ctub held a dinner and spon­sored a theater party for Universal Notre Dame Night. GREG HALPIN was succeeded as presi­dent by JIM MURRAY. The dinner was fea­tured by an installation of officers — and no speakers. 
Berrien County 
The Berrien County club enjoyed a re-activa­tion meeting as well as celebrating Universal Notre Dame Night by holding a dinner session at the Waters Farm, near Niles, Mich. DR. PAUL LEONARD was elected president for the ensuing year. He presented the Man of the Year award to Prof. J. ARTHUR REYNIERS, Director of LOBUND Institute. 
Berrien County's Alan of the Year, J. Arthur Reyniers, '30, (center) is congratulated by Club President Dr. Paul Leonard, *43, (r.) and Prof. Wm. Downey, '28. 

Boston 
The Boston Club's celebration of Universal Notre Dame Night was, as one guest put it, "the bargain of the year." A dinner dance was held at the Hub Room, Sheraton Plaza Hotel, Boston. Chairman of the affair was JOHN T. BURKE, and Chairman of Entertainment was GEORGE CLARKE. Honored guests included the REV. ALFRED MENDEZ. C. S. C , As­sistant to the Vice-President of Notre Dame, and the Rev. George P. Benaglia, C. S. C., Vice-President. Stonehill Colleje. 
Father Mendcz was outstanding as the prin­cipal speaker, and certainly made all those pres­ent feel most proud to be connected with Notre Dame. Everyone present felt honored that Notre Dame sent a man of Father Mendez's ability to Boston to attend our Universal Notre Dame Night. 
JOHN V. MORAN, '30. past recipient of No­tre Dame *'Man of the Year," and currently Purchasing Agent for the City of Boston, pre­sented JACK NYE DUFFEY, '35, with the plaque of "Notre Dame Man of the Year." Jack Du^ey has been the backbone of the Boston Club for the last six years. Until April 1 he served as State Agent for the Springfield Group of Insurance Companies. Jack has been trans­ferred to the Rochester, N. Y. area. Boston's loss shall be Rochester's gain for Jack is one of the best organizers and one of the most viv­acious individuals that any club could have. 
GEORGE CLARKE did an exceptional job in lining up the entertainment for the evening. Every bit of it was outstanding with Larry Green's Orchestra, Ving Merlin and his en­chanted Violins (4 lovely girls), Tony Bruno at the piano, and Jay Marshall, magician ex­traordinary. Everything was excellent. 
Election of officers saw all the officers of the past year being reinstated for another year.

Calumet District 
JUDGE LUTHER M. SWYGERT, '27, of the Hammond Federal Court was presented with the Calumet Club of Notre Dame's "Man of the Year" award at its Universal Notre Dame Night dinner on April 6 at a Hammond restaurant. The award was presented by the REV. JOHN J. CAVANAUGH, C. S. C . Director of the Notre Dame Foundation and former president of the University. In presenting the "Man of the Year" award to Judge Swygert. Fr. Cavanaugh lauded his achievements in the legal profession and his years of service to Notre Dame. In a brief address to the evening's gathering, Fr. Cav­anaugh challenged the popular connotation of academic freedom. 
Recent innovations and the march of progress on the Notre Dame campus was another topic which Fr. Cavanaugh discussed briefly. He cited the construction of the O'Shaughnessey Liberal and Fine Arts Building, the new domi­tory, Fisher Hall, and the Morns Inn as evi­dence of the growth of the school's facilities toward making it the "greatest university in the world." 
At the business session of the meeting, JAMES R. MORRISON. '34. was elected to succeed WILLIAM J. RILEY, *38, as president of the Club. Other officers, elected by accla­mation, are: JEROME GAINER, '43, vice-president; ERNEST HUFFMAN, '49. secretary; and JACK O'GREN, '49, treasurer. Riley, TOM RADIGAN. '38, and JAMES PURCELL. '42, were named to the newly-formed Board of Di­rectors for the Club. 

Capital District 
If another bright star has been seen in the East, you can credit its appearance to the bril­liant success of the Universal Notre Dame Night Dinner held by the Notre Dame Club of the Capital District (NY) at the swank Empire Room of the Hotel Ten Eyck, Albany, on Wed­nesday evening, April 15th.

Hochrieter, who directed the skit, is flanked by new Club president Jim Murray on the left, and by outgoing prexy Greg Holpin on right. 
The club was fortunate in obtaining Notre Dame's AU-American end, DR. EDDIE AN­DERSON. '22. as speaker. Dr. Eddie inter­rupted his Spring football practice at Holy Cross College, Worcester, Mass.. long enough to come to Albany to renew old friendships and deliver a stirring talk that brought back fond memories and warmed the hearts of every Notre Dame man. 
Although the alumni of Northeastern New York number only a little over 50. in addition to the religious of Holy Cross, there were 160 at the dinner. This indicates the marvelous work that JOHN F. CAMPBELL, '26, did in staging this affair as chairman. Both John and Eddie were boyhood friends in Iowa, and other lowans now with the Albany Club are JAMES 
J. CONMEY, '28, and HAROLD J. MAR­SHALL, '26. 
So successful were the club members in fo­cusing attention on Notre Dame, that Albany's Mayor Coming proclaimed the week of April 12th, NOTRE DAME WEEK in Albany. JAMES J. DRISLANE. '38. did the document; SHERB HERRICK, '36, and DR. BERNARD DUFFY, '30, made the contact that led to the Proclamation and publicity in the press. 
Bob Monahan. formerly Albany chief of the UP and now Director of Public Relations for the New York State Truway Authority, handled the publicity with the hand of a professional, and no less than a dozen stories appeared in the Albany-Troy-Schenectady dailies. 
Members of the Congregation of Holy Cross present were REV. EDWARD L. O'MALLEY, REV. BERNARD McCAFFREY. REV. JO­SEPH M. QUINN. and BROTHER LUDWIG CROSSON. The gathering also numbered three coaches in addition to Dr. Anderson. THAD-• DEUS J. BUDYNKIEWICZ. '49, coach of Christian Brother Academy; Larry T. O'Neill, coach of Philip Schuyler High School, and DAN­IEL J. CUNHA. *35. coach of Sienna College. The Holy Cross College alumni were represent­ed at the dinner by the club president, Joseph F. Feily. 
SHERB HERRICK, ace radio personality in Albany, becomes club president with the retiring of Dr. Bernard A. Duffy. JOSEPH W. CON­LON, '35, moves from the office of Secretary-Treasurer to Vice President and FRANK D. 
OTT, '22, becomes the present Secretary-Treas­urer. 
The meeting ended with a rousing cheer for John F. Campbell whose fine work made pos­sible the great success of Notre Dame Night in Albany, the South Bend of the East.

Central New York 
The Notre Dame Club of Central New York will honor a native Central New Yorker, REV. THEODORE M. HESBURGH, C. S. C, presi­dent of Notre Dame, at a testimonial dinner at the Hotel Syracuse on May 27. 

Club members who arc engineering the big project are striving for a monstrocity of an attendance which they estimate will exceed the six-hundred mark. The committee in charge of arrangements is urging all of the alumni in this area to be patrons for the dinner, and in addition, hope that each alumnus will get sev­eral additional patrons for ihe occasion. Patron's tickets are also available for those wishing to attend the cocktail party which is being plan­ned for pre-dinner time. 
The cost of the patron ticket is SlO, which will include the holder's dinner only and admis­sion for him and female escort to the cocktail party, as well as listing the patron's name, if he so desires, on the patron's list in the pro­gram. 
Tickets for the dinner are S4 each. Be­cause the response has already been enthusiastic, we request that tickets be purchased immediately from PHILIP KELLEY, chairman. 500 Locw BIdg., 706 Stinard Avenue. Syracuse. N. Y. 
Central Pennsylvania 

The Central Pennsylvania Club of Nctre Dame held its annual Universal Notre Dame Night observance at the "40-8" Club in Altoona on April 12. Alumni and their guests from the Io-> cal area attended as well as from Clearfield. Punxsutawney and Ebensburg, Pa.

After the dinner, a film featuring the high­lights of the Notre Dame 1952 football season was shown. 
Chicago 
A large and enthusiastic crowd turned out for the annual observance of Universal Notre Dame Night held on April 11 at the Drake Hotel by the Notre Dame Club of Chicago. 
The major events of the evening included an address by the REVERAND JOHN J. CAVA­NAUGH, C. S. C , Director of the Notre Dame Foundation, and the presentation of a merit scroll to JUSTICE ROGER J. KILEY, '23, of the Appellate Court of Illinois, for his services to the community and the University. 
An AII-American end, and captain of the bas. ketball team during his undergraduate days, Justice Kiley has for a number of years been co-conducting a seminar of studies of "great books" for students in the Notre Dame law school. Father Cavanaugh has been working with him in the conducting of the seminar. 
The presentation of the scroll was made by JOHN J. O'SHAUGHNESSY, '33, of Winnetka, vice-president of the Notre Dame Club of Chi­cago, en behalf of the University. 
Other features on the program were a brief "farewell" talk by retiring club president LUKE TIERNAN, '36, of Winnetka; a tribute to Tier­nan by his successor in office, president GIL SEAMAN, '31, of Elmhurst; an expression of appreciation to his assistants by event chair­man RAY McGRATH, '37. of Oak Park, and the installation into office of new officers.

The most promising project in the galaxy of recent worthwhile activities, however, was the Chicago Club's St. Valentine's Day party in benefit of the Club's scholarship fund. This first effort on a large scale, co-chairmaned by JOHN McGUIRE and ARTHUR CONRAD, netted $2,700 for the fund. 
Cleveland 
The annual Fathcr'and-Son Communion Break­fast in memory of KNUTE ROCKNE was held this year on March 29 with Mass celebrated in St. John's Cathedral and breakfast following in the Assembly Room of the HoUenden Hotel.

Dean of the College of Arts and Let­ters at Notre Dame, who was able to reach both fathers and sons with his narrations of life on the campus, from which he drew a moral we all could incorporate in our everyday living. 

One of the highlights of the Breakfast was the presentation of the "Notre Dame Man of the Year" certificate by JIM COLLERAN '35 to TOM F. BYRNE, '28. Besides being extremely active in Notre Dame circles, Tom has been active in community projects, occupying official capacities in many organizations, including serv­ing as President of the Board of Merrick House, on the Board of St. Alexis Hospital, as a loan­ed executive from the Ohio Bell Telephone Co. to the Community Chest, and on the Budget and Policy Committee of the Cleveland Welfare Fed­eration.
