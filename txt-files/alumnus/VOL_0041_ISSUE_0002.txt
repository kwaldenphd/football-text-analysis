U.N.D. NIGHT '62 TO HAIL 
Editor Managing Editor 
TRADITION OF PATRIOTISM 
"NOTRE DAJIE'S ALL-AMERICAN TRADITIONS" is the theme of the 39th Annual Universal Notre Dame Night under which most of the University's 180 active Alumni Clubs are expected to surpass all records in their celebra­
yylf
tion of Notre Dame's history of Americanism—^Ameri­canism in the richest and fullest sense, with all the mani­festations connoted by the phrase "God, Country and Notre Dame": patriotism and militant Americanism demonstrated by the University's unique contribution of chaplains and fighting men to all the conflicts in which the United States has been involved since 1842 (a mani­festation s)'mbolized by this year's tribute to Father Wil­liam Corby, hero of Gettysburg and Antietam, with the Gettysburg Centennial Field Mass mentioned on page 
4) ; Americanism in the polidco-socio-economic sense demonstrated by Notre Dame's gift of men and scien­tific resources to political, economic, civic and all other facets of public life; and Americanism in its broadest connotations — religious, scientific, himianitarian, edu­cational, cultural, athletic, etc.

DEVORE TO PILOT '63 IRISH WITH KUHARICH RESIGNATION 
Hugh Devore, '34, freshman football coach for the past five years, has been appointed to a second one-year term as head football coach after the recent resig­nation of Joseph Kuharich, '38, to accept an executive position with the National Football League. David Hurd, '60, a former assistant freshman coach, was also named to the football staff after two years as an assistant coach at Cleveland's John Carroll University, as were Jerry Stoltz, formerly an assistant at Toledo, and Gus Cifclli, '30, a former player coach in professional football. 
Hugh played three years at end under Hunk Anderson, the last as co-captain. Coaching at Fordham, Providence, Holy Cross, St. Bonaventurc, N.Y.U., Dayton and the Philadelphia Eagles, he was Notre Dame end coach under Ed Mc-Kecver in 1943-44 and head coach in 1945 with a 7-2-1 record. He has han­dled the freshman and recruiting chores since returning under Terry Brennan in 1958. 

dress for the annual .Alumni Banquet in the air-conditioned North Dining Hall. 
The Classes will return to their halls for nightcaps and midnight snacks before turning in to rise on Sunday for a last visit to favorite shrines and the culmination of the week end in the .Annual .Alumni Mass. 
ADD ECUMENICAL ALUMNI 

The article in the last issue listing 
t^velve members of the Congregation of 
Holy Cross and 24 other alumni at the 
Second Vatican Council failed to mention 
ten honorary alumni overseas: Their Em­
inences Gregory Cardinal Agagianian, 
Amleto Cardinal Cicognani, Valerian 
Cardinal Gracias, Franz Cardinal Koenig, 
Giaconio Cardinal Lercaro, Giovanni 
Cardinal Montini, Aloisius Cardinal 
Muench, Alfredo Cardinal Ottaviani, 
Laurian Cardinal Rugambwa; and Most 
Rev. Martin J. O'Connor, rector of 
North American College in Rome. 
THE CLASS PROGRAMS 

Most of the Class officers have appointed reunion chairmen and local committees, held planning meetings and mailed preliminary information to classmates. Even those who have not have tentative plans for the week­end which will be given here and included in a general mailing to be sent soon to members of all reunion classes. Those who remit the reunion fee in advance will be pre-registered and assured of accommoda­tions with their classmates. 
Early plans of the Classes are as follows: 
The Golden Jubilee Class of 1913, un­der Secretary Paul Byrne, and men of earlier Classes in the 50-Year Club, will probably share .Alumni Hall with the 45th .Anniversary Class of 1918 and be their guests at a revival of the "Traditions" Dinner on Friday night. President John Lemmer and Secretary Charles Call have appointed Father George Holderith as local reunion chairman and have already got a response from 15 or 20 "early birds." 
Veteran Secretarj- Louis Bruggner will greet his classmates of 1923 at Alumni Hall, and the 40-Year Class will dine Friday Night either off-campus or at the Morris Inn. 
Class of 1928 President James .Allan and Secretary Louis Buckley have Father .An­drew Mulreany and Edward Quinn as local co-chairmen and more than twenty class­mates operating national publicity and pro­motion. The only Class to guarantee an at­tendance of 150 before Christmas, the 35­year Class has reserved Lyons Hall for the third straight year and will kick off an ac­tive weekend program with a Class Din­ner at the Mom's Inn. 
Morrissey Hall is the probable residence for the Class of 1933 under president John O'Shaughnessy, Secretary John Hoyt and Reunion Chairman Charles Farris, who started polling their classmates before Christmas. 
The Silver Jubilee Class of 1938 will probably also inhabit Morrissey. President Charles Sweeney and Secretary Burnett Bauer have appointed a large committee under Chairman Edward Cronin to plan a gala weekend including three trips to the North Dining Hall, the second for luncheon as guest of their president classmate. Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C. A national committee has also been appointed to drum up attendance in all 50 states. 
1943 Secretary Jack Wiggins has asked for .Alumni Hall as a Class residence and for an old Reunion and Monogram hand. Bill Earley, as local chairman. Bill may repeat something like his pizza smorgasbord of 1958. 
Secretary John Defant is still selecting his 1948 local committee, but it is likely that the Class will inhabit Howard Hall and dine in the North Dining Hall. 
Dave McElvain is looking for local help with the Class of 1953 program, while 1958 Secretary .Art Roule is directing the 1958 elTort from Texas through local chairman Joseph Corcoran. The two Classes may share Dillon Hall, largest facilit)- on the campus, and guarantee excellent indoor or outdoor buffets as part of the program. 
This is the early outlook. Further informa­tion will be forthcoming in the mails. Mean­while, check your roster and Dome, try to form a group, and let your Class Secretary know you'll be there. 
ADMIRAL ANDERSON NAMED FOR 81st LAETARE MEDAL

NOTRE DAME MEMORIAL MASS TO LAUNCH CENTENNIAL AT GETTYSBURG ON JUNE 29 
This summer the Civil War Centennial reaches its peak with the Centenar)' of the Battle of Gettysburg, generally conceded to be the "high-water mark of the Confederacy" and the crucial engagement of the War between the States. 
Nearly one-third of Notre Dame's priests took part in the Civil War as chaplains. Of these priests of Holy Cross — including Fathers James M. Dillon, Peter Paul Cooney, E. B. Kilroy, Joseph 
C. Carrier, Paul E. Gillen, Joseph Leveque anl Julian Bourget, 
C.S.C. — perhaps the most colorful was Rev. William Corby, C.S.C. 
Veteran of many engagements with the Army of the Potomac, Father Corby b known to most Notre Dame men because of identi­cal statues on the Gettysburg battlefield and in front of Corby Hall on the campus. The statues depict Father Corby standing on a rock, giving absolution to the men of the Irish Brigade just before the battle. Later Father Corby was president of the University on two separate occasions and died while ser\'ing as provincial superior in 1897. 
The dates of the official centennial observance are Monday, July • 1, through Wednesday, July 3, 1963, commemorating the corre­sponding three-day period of battle in 1863. As a prelude to this obser\'ance. Rev. Thomas J. O'Donnell, C.S.C, has completed ar­rangements for a Notre Dame Day on the battlefield, to be held on Saturday, June 29, featuring a Memorial Mass at 12 noon 
E.D.T. at the Eternal Peace Light in Gettysburg National Park. 
The Mass, to be offered by Bishop Leech of Harrisburg, will highlight a day dedicated not only to Father Corby and the Notre Dame men of the Civil War, but also to the patriotism of thousands of Notre Dame men in World Wars I and II, the Mexican, Spanish-American and Korean Wars, etc. 
The batdeiield is within easy weekend dri\ing distance for alumni from Ohio to New England to the Carolinas, and Notre Dame families in the Middle States have been encouraged to make group tours, box-lunch e.xcursions, etc. Maps and further information are a\'ailable for all alumni who plan to attend this event.
