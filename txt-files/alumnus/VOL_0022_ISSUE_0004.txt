AlunuU ReU(f4a444. BuUetUt 
: BY REV. JOHN P. LTNCH, CS.C, '25 : 
WHAT A LIFE 

A non-Catholic once said: "I'd be a Catholic, but I can't see myself telling my private life and faults to any man." Th e Catholic answered: "Well, you see, we Cath­olics can't afford ?25 a crack for a Park Avenue psychiatrist, s o we tell our sins to Father. Shea around the cor­ner at St. Johns." Last week we Fmther Lyndi had a visitor, re­
ferred to us in­directly by a psychiatrist. The visitor wanted to make some inquiries about Catholicism. Her main objection to Ca­tholicism was telling her "private life to any man in Confession" — and she had just been to a psychiatrist. 
She quickly saw that inconsistent ob­jection. So in the next hour's discussion, we gave not proofs for Catholicism but the old favorite theme, often stated in this column. 
Catholicism is a life, the life of grace 

— and not merdy a negative thing, ab­sence of sin — the glorious life of Christ in us, and we should live up to our dig­nity as adopted sons of God and brothers of Christ 
Briefly, Catholicism is not a code or set of rules to live by, but a Person to live for. Chesterton expressed it far better in: "Catholic doctrine and Cath­olic morals are walls, it is true, but the walls of a playground." 
CONnNUING CHBIST'S LIFE 

The Catholic layman hardly thinks of himself as marching side by side with the priest in the crusade of Christ and for Christ 
Yet that is his destiny and privilege 

— because he participates in the priest­hood of Christ. 
You are apostles with your priests. You, too, are instruments of the Re­demption. Through you, Christ contin­ues His mission. . 
You are where your priests cannot be 

— in offices, factories, stores, clubs, army camps, and battleships. You are Christ-bearers there in the 
state of grace. Practice of our Faith should befit our tremendous dignity as adopted sons of God, brothers of Christ, participants in Christ's priesthood. ­
That phrase — participants in Christ's priesthood — isn't a pretty phrase to "pep" you up. 

Lenf s over now and well give you plenty of meat to chew on — some real dogma and doctrine supporting that phrase expressing your dignity — par­ticipants in Christ's priesthood. 
PBIESTS OF CHBIST Both Angers-Burke's Mystical Body, 

p. 155, and Kavanagh's Lay Partici­pation in Christ^s Priesthood, (Doctoral Thesis, Catholic University—1935) give plenty of proofs to support and explain that title. From the latter, (pp. 119, 120 and 102) we are going to quote at length for theological accuracy: 
"St Peter entitles all Christians 'a kinely priesthood,* not because they themselves are kinffs. but because they belone to Christ the Kine­
"St. Peter's -references insinuate that this doc­trine of lay participation in Christ's priesthood is consequent upon the truth of the Mystical Body. The cxcsesis of the Pctrine texts shoirs that it is in virtue of their intimate spiritual union with Christ, that all Christiai^s receive a sacerdotal character, which enables them to fulfil their religious oblieations in xadon with Christ the High Priest 
"The chief sacerdotal privilege given to all Christians through Baptism is the power to. offer acceptable worship to God. This includes the power to receive the other sacraments, to share in the offering of the Holy Sacrifice, and to par­take of the Holy Sacrifice in Holy Communion. . 
"It is through the baptismal character that all the baptized parUcipate, as members of Christ in all the sacerdotal functions of the whole Mys­tical Body, for through it they are made members of the same body: The character of Confirmation augments the baptismal participation in Christ's priesthood, because it increases the sacerdotal power given in Baptism, and intensifies the Chris­tian's configuration to Christ as priest llie pri­mary sacerdotal function of the confirmed is to profess publicly and defend the Faith. 
"ST. THOMAS SAYS" 

"St. Thomas outlines in general terms just what this more active and more extensive partici­pation of the confirmed is, when he says that Baptism enables the Christian to perform those duties that pertain to his own salvation, whereas Confirmation makes him capable of fulfilling the functions that are concerned with the public pro­fession and defence of the Faith. From this Thomistic definition, it is evident that the character of Confirmation is given for a wider purpose than the spiritual enrichment and exal­tation of the confirmed man himself. In the pub­lic profession and defence of the Faith, the con­firmed is to teach, admonish, and strengthen others in the things that pertain to divine wor­ship. Briefly, these privileges and duties include all that is comprised under the heading of Cath­olic Action. All these duties pertain not to the confirmed's private spiritual life, but to his social spiritual life." 
SOLDIERS OF CHBIST 
A duty, yes, but a glorious privilege to profess and defend the Faith, as a participant in Christ's priesthood and militantly so. The little catechism calls us by virtue of Confirmation, "Soldiers of Christ." 
We know lots of cases where Notre Dame men have been living up to this dignity, and having a lot of fun doing so. 
We recall one who has done an amaz­ing work in establishing a few years ago in a large city a Catholic library which has become a model for similar Catholic libraries in various cities. 

We know another who, in cooperation with other Catholic college graduates in his city, established a lecture forum, which has done an enormous amount of good in diffusing Catholic doctrine on morality, literature and government 
We know some who have set up pam­phlet racks in their parishes, and the pamphlets have accomplished great good among Catholics and non-Catholics. 
Many others have volunteered their services to their pastors in various ca­pacities. Hdping the pastor certainly is the essence of participation in the priest­hood. 
All of these were doing something not queer, not fanatical. They were being intelligent Catholics, living out their dignity as lay participants in Christ's priesthood — defending and promoting and teaching Christ's doctrine. 
They were being instruments of the Hedonption. Throu^ them, Christ was continuing His mission. 
BATTLEFIELD BUT PLAYGBOUND TOO 

Most of our younger alumni are sol­diering — and many have died — for God, country and Notre Dame. 
To us older alumni there is extended also the duty and privUege of soldiering for God, country and Notre Dame. 
For God — to live as an adopted son of God and brother of Christ and ad­vance His Will and Kingdom. 
For Country — to protect it against pagan corruption and totalitarianism by promoting Christian principles in gov­ernment, literature, education and all phases of society. 
For Notre Dame — to live as a son of Notre Dame, with the real spirit of Notre Dame, which is her spirit — to live for her Son. 
It's a duty but a glorious privilege also — and a lot of fun. 
"Catholic doctrine and morals are walls, it is true, but the walls of a play­ground."

Our Program for Progress 
Pearl Harbor hurled a physical chal­lenge at America which ended the philo­sophical approaches to our entry or non-entry in world war. On December 7, 1941, we were in, ready or not. 
As Notre Dame men, we are witness­ing, almost daily, incidents that are moral Pearl Harbors. Attacks on the state, attacks on the church, attacks on the family, attacks on our individual rights occur with increasing frequency and boldness. 
It is no longer a question of personal wishes. We are in the fight for princi­ples. We have now either to fight or to run. 
Knowing the only proper Notre Dame answer, your Alumni Association has begun quickly the long delayed program of preparation for this war. 
Like the present world struggle we are faced with multiple fronts. They are all important in themselves and impor­tant in the pattern. 

By James E. Armstrons, '25, Alumni Secretary 
You 
The first front is you, the individual alumnus. You have been trained by Notre Dame to know truth. You have been taught objective standards by which right and wrong are measured. You have been taught the proper end of man, the only end, and the means to that end. 
Two things are necessary for your in­dividual part in this struggle. You must know articulately these principles in which you were grounded. Simple faith is not enough, invaluable as it is. For strangely enough, much of the world confusion rises from the great masses of people who do not know what you know. And your second problem there­fore is to see that what you know is made general knowledge. 
Notre Dame 
The second front is Notre Dame. The University is a continuous training camp for truth. Its classes are graduated with the background essential to a right leadership. And the University for yon continues to provide the contacts and the knowledge which will keep you fit for fighting under the new conditions. Moral warfare adapts the methods of a new order as rapidly and as devastatingly as the machines of the world armies. 
It is essential that we preserve Notre Dame. To that end we have set up ma­chinery for your cooperation. 
The Alumni Fund is no longer just a generous gesture of loyalty. It is true that the University has enjoyed, through its Navy programs, full functioning of its facilities. But it is equally true that these programs, operated at no profit, are concerned with the physical facili­ties. They are not concerned with reli­gion; they are not concerned with phi­losophy; they are not concerned with academic research; they are not con­cerned with graduate study; they are not concerned with the education of priests and brothers; they are not con­cerned with the library and the art gal­
lery as agents of culture; they are not concerned with tradition and the pres­ervation of Notre Dame's character and integrity for your sons and grandsons. This is not a fault, except as concen­tration on the urgent needs of war de­mands such fault. The Fund is at pres­ent the University's major agency in protecting these factors which are so vital to its nature, and to its future. If intercollegiate athletics should yield to the exigencies of war, and if civilian enrollment drops to its fast approaching zero, then the Fund will be almost the sole agent of preserving the things that differentiate the University from a training school. 


Your Home 
A third front is your home. (These fronts are not intended to be in the 
W. B.D. J. E. A. 

order of their importance). You have in your home the basic unit of society. By proper thinking and action and example in the home you have perhaps the great­est weapon for the influence you need to wield. Literature, the movies, Catho­lic press, family religious zeal, citizen­ship, — all can be developed to a marked degree in a good home. And the good home is the simplest ans\ver to the in­roads of juvenile delinquency, birth con­trol, wrong control of education, and other attacks on the family. 
Your Church 

Many Notre Dame men are not Cath­olics. But in any church, or synagogue, where the spirit is sound and the indi­vidual cooperation is generously and intelligently given, there are opportun­ities unlimited for the successful opposi­tion of those movements which would wipe out the churches and synagogues of the world. 
Notre Dame men are trained in a leadership which could be of inestimable value to pastors. Most pastors expect this leadership to crystallize in their college trained parishioners. We can no longer concern ourselves with the con­troversies of whether it has or hasn't and whose has been the fault if any. This is the time for unity under the many programs that the clergy and the hierarchy have instituted. Your inter­est can find many valuable outlets. 

Your Community 

The breakdown of leadership gener­ally has been a source of challenge to higher education's history in this coun­try. The answer seems to lie not so much in inability as in apathy. The col­lege trained man has been given the ability without the sense of responsibili­ty. Again, we need not stop to philoso­phize. The fact of the need for active and intelligent participation is so appar­ent now as to be receiving the sanction of all colleges, religious and secular. The government of cities, which is the basic government, has been left too long in hands more willing than able, a state reflected In higher brackets on frequent occasion. A strong civic consciousness on your part, in separating good issues from bad, principled candidates from imprincipled, and in making these 
trained observations articulate for your neighbors, would go an unbelievably long way toward eliminating a fundamental national weakness. 
* * * 

These are but a few of the major fronts. Your careful and active atten­tion to any one of them will be construc­tive. In the aggregate, you can hardly estimate the good. 
To implement this move toward ma­turity in the Association, we have taken several steps with the University's co­operation. 
Bill Dooley has severed his student publications connection (business mana­ger) to devote full time to his alumni work. But much of his work is still the editing of the increasing and valuable mass of detail in the ALUMNUS, which is our articulation medium. This challenges, even in its present bi-monthly status, the full time and attention of an editor. In addition, he has the problem—growing to startling stature—of placement, the hope of doing something tangible for the Notre Dame man who is mustered out of service, and the Notre Dame boy coming up who may face the competition of the Notre Dame man coming out of service. The challenge of this field is tremendous for good. 
I have severed my connection with academic publicity (which began, the last time, in November, 1941, when Tom Barry went with the Sun in Chicago). My primary interest lies in the Associ­ation program generally, its policies, its records ramifications, a rising tide of correspondence with individual alumni, Clubs and other contacts. I have the interests of some 94 Clubs at heart, with the knowledge that their heroic work could be tremendously augmented by more help from Notre Dame, and that more Clubs are possible when we have the facility for handling them. The Annual Alumni Fund is already well established as a major operation for Notre Dame. Its detail might well be a full time job. And in the field of promo­tion, there is the suspenseful responsi­
bility of knowing that when the war is won and the Navy program is past, the present enrollment of some 600 civilians must be jumped rapidly to a minimum 3,000. In this process the alumni can be, as they were in 1934-35, invaluable aids. 
So, although we have an active Board of Directors, and although we have dropped some of our burdens, we are still not in the clear and unencumbered path of progress we would like to see ahead. 
The Committees on Religion and Citi­zenship which we have asked each Club to form to speed up the work of realiz­ing our new place in the program will require close and interested cooperation from the Alumni Oflice, from the Uni­versity, and from all of you. 
Of the need for this mature and im­mediate action there can no longer be any doubt. All that you were taught to believe in at Notre Dame is being chal­lenged in one way or another. The phy­sical war in which so many of you are playing a vital part is only one bitter and violent phase. Its peace table vnll not solve many struggles which involve you. 
We are no longer play-boys. We are no longer able to leave our emotions to cheerleaders. We can no longer ignore the uncomfortable and the annoying. We might as well face the fact that in addition to having either to fight or to run, there is no longer in the world, for those who believe as we believe, any place to run. 
With your cooperation, spreading your trained leadership to those about you, however, the fight can turn in our favor. If this sounds like a sermon, just start reading your newspaper with these things in mind. 
FATHER LEAHY APPOINTED 

Rev. Hugh O'Donnell, C.S.C, presi­dent, on March 13 appointed as his ad­ministrative assistant Rev. James J. Leahy, C.S.C, Chicago-bom young fac­ulty member. Father Leahy took the post made vacant by the death, March 2, of Rev. James D. Trahey, C.S.C.

Civilian Attendance One-Fiftti of Normal 
Degrees Awarded at Convocation on Feb. 25; Father Eugene Burke is Speaker; Four N. R. O. T. C Grad­uates Receive Commissions in Historic Ceremony. 
Approximately 1,850 •V-12 students and 650 civilian students registered for the Notre Dame term which began on March 6. Total University attendance consequently remained about level with attendance in the term which ended on Feb. 25. Civilian attendance was about 20 per cent of pre-war normal. 
Some 450 new V-12 students are in­cluded in the present student body, and approximately 100 new civilian stu­dents. A large contingent of the new 'V-12S are men from the fleet who, hav­ing special qualifications, have been detached from their ships for college training. 
Of the departing •V-12 men, the large majority were assigned to midshipmen schools or to other navy training sta­tions. Sixteen were assigned to naval 
E.O.T.C. units. Eighty-seven Marines went to Parris Island, S. C, and 42 Ma­rines to the pre-midshipman school at Asbury Park, N. J. 
Kev. Eugene P. Burke, C.S.C., deliv­ered the address on Feb. 25 as 94 under­graduate students and six graduate stu­dents received degrees in Washington Hall from Kev. Hugh O'Donnell, C.S.C, president, in a special convocation. This was the first convocation since the for­mal Commencement of October, 1943, which was the final formal Commence­ment "for the duration." 
The effect of war was evident in the fact that many of the members of the Feb. 25 class had already been called to active duty and thus received their de­grees in absentia. Other men, receiving their degrees on the stage, were in uni­form. 
Included among the 94 receiving un­dergraduate deg^rees were four mem­bers of Notre Dame's unit of the naval 
R.O.T.C. who had completed eight se­mesters of academic work in the Univer­sity. They were Ensign Thomas R. Shellworth, Portland, Ore.; Ensign John Penning^ton Lawler, Tampa, Fla.; En­sign John Cahill O'Rourke, Chicago; and Ensign Charles M. Urruela, Miami Beach, Fla. These men were the first members of the R.O.T.C. to receive Notre Dame degrees since the unit was 
Adding further historical importance to the program was the commissioning as ensigns of the same four men. Pre­siding at this ceremony was Capt. J. Richard Barry, U.S.N., commanding all the naval units on the Notre Dame cam­pus. The four were thus, of course, the first Notre Dame R.O.T.C. men to be commissioned. 
By decision of the Navy Department, 77 other members of the R.O.T.C, who had completed seven semesters at Notre Dame, were commissioned on Feb. 27 in a special ceremony in the naval drill hall on the campus. The action was in keeping with a nationwide navy pro­gram to increase the number of com­missioned officers on active duty. 
Captain Barry awarded commissions to this group also, and Father O'Don­nell delivered a brief address to the men. Very soon after the commissioning they left the campus for posts of active duty. 
By decision of the University Council, seven-semester R.O.T.C. men with satis­factorily completed academic work, may, after an additional semester of satis­factory service on active duty in the navy, receive from Notre Dame the de­gree of bachelor of naval science. Thus, the 77 ensigns commissioned on Feb. 27 may receive this deg^ree at the next con­vocation next June. 
BROTHER RAYMOND DIES 

The ALUMNUS is regrettably late in its reporting of the death of Brother Raymond, C.S.C, on Sept. 5 last. 'For 23 years a solicitor for The Ave Maria, Brother Raymond had traveled in every state in the union, and visited many alumni homes. 
In his earlier years he was assistant to the secretary of the University of Notre Dame, and was for some time in' charge of the .Notre Dame bookstore. He prefected on the campus and was known to many Notre Dams men of an earlier generation for' his quiet and kindly counsel. Brother Raymond was bom Willis J. Ott, in 1877. He was pro­fessed in 1902.

Hershel Horton's Last Letter 
Wrote It as He Lay Dying in New Guinea. 
The final message to his family of 1st Lt. Hershel G. Horton, ex. '43, is now well known across the nation: it has been in print innmnerable times, has been quoted in sermons and speeches and is preserved in the Congressional Record, But since Hershel was a Notre Bame man, the ALUM KUS wants his message to appear here too so that it vnll for uncounted years remain here to be read by Notre Dame men in their own publication. 
As he lay dying in the jungles of New Guinea, Hershel, 29 years old, wrote the message to his parents, Mr. and Mrs. George A, Horton, Jr., Aurora, 111., and to his sister. Already cited for bravery and meritorious sendee by Gen­eral Douglas MacArthur, he had led a ration mission from Sananada to Sopuda. His party of 367 men found themselves trapped between tAvo pow­erful Japanese forces. For 21 days the unit battled against the heavy odds, 100 of them dying, but the Japs were re­pelled and the Americans went on to Soptlda. Later they learned they had slain 2,200 Japs in the engagement. 

At Sopuda the soldiers again met the Japs. After this battle, Horton went in­to the jungle for the identification discs of the American fallen, and it was while he was on this mission of mercy that he was fatally shot. At least five men were killed, and many others were wounded, in attempts to rescue him. 
Lt. Col. John R. Murphy, Kansas City, Mo., received the personal effects of Hershel, and he is the ^vrite^ of the first letter.

COPY OF HERSHEL'S LAST LETTER WRITTEN-IN.HIS NOTE BOOK AND KEPT IN HIS PRAYER BOOK 
New Guinea, Dec. 11. 1942 

Dearly Beloved. My dear sweet Father, Mother and Sister: Mr. & Mrs. George A. Horton Jr., and Sister Gwenivcre-
About 9:00 A.M. I came out on a mercy patrol to pick up dog tags etc, of our dead. This was the morning of Tuesday, December 1, 1942. 
I was trying to turn over the body of Captain Keast, a friend of mine, when I was shot two or three times in my right leg and hip. L t Ellis, Sgt. Young and Pvt. Merle Christian were with me. I yelled that I was shot, I was in front of all but Merle, they ran for shelter. I dragged myself for a Jap grass shanty about twelve yards to the rear of where I was shot. 
Sgt. Young said he would send help as soon as possible. Possible never came, evidently because I lud there unattended in any way without food or 
•water or medical care. Two days of semi-deliri­ousness and then I called Captain Shirley's name, Ellis, Help. etc. Finally Lt. Gibbs and one of his men from the Anti Tank Co. came to me. Their Medic also came up. Hie Medic gave me my first drink of water in three days, but he had no food to offer. The medic bandaged me temporarily, L t Gibbs promised me aid, but I never saw him again. The Medic came back and gave me water, but a man helping him got shot there and that scared him away. Life from then on was a ter­rible nightmare. The hot burning sun, the deliri­ous nights. No one came near me from then on, but I did dig a water hole in four days time, which was wonderful to me; although it was pol­luted by all the rotting bodies within 12 f t and 14 f t of me. Then two or three rescue parties from my Company came out, but they never could find me. On two or three occasions they nearly got to me when the Japs or a rainstorm made it impossible. The Japs are living within 15 yds. of me. I see them every day. 
I have tried to make splints and crawl or walk out, but I just can't make it Today, (as nearly as I can judge, Dec 11) I managed to stand, but I could go no farther. A Jap shot me in the shoulder and neck as I weekly sat there and I thought my time had come, but no, I sit and lay here in this terrible place, wondering not why God has forsaken me; but rather why He is mak­ing me suffer this terrible end? It is true I un­derstand life and its reasons now, but why should He send it to this terrible grave with me? Why not let me live and tell others? I am not afraid to die although I have nearly lost my faith a couple of days here. I have a pistol here, but I could not kill myself; I still have faith in the Ix)rd. I think He must be giving me the supreme test I know now how Christ felt on the cross. 
I have imagined hearing several other rescue parties, but one's ima^nation grows as his body shrivels. 
I have had no food of any kind since that morning I was shot My right hip- is broken and my right leg. both compound fractures; else I could have been out of here in those first couple of days, wounds or no wounds. 
My life has been good, but I am so young and have so many things undone that a man of 29 should do. 
We may never know Ciod's purpose in striking me down like this, but "He mast have one. I can still say tnithfully that I have never killed a man, although I have been ordered to order others to. 
I wonder how long a man can go on like this? I shall continue to pray for a miracle of rescue. I want to commend Lt Ellis for his wonderful efforts and heroism in attempt to rescue me under the Jap treachery. 
God bless you My loved ones. Keep the faith, don't worry. I shall see you all again some day. I prepare to meet My Maker. 
Love, Hershel.

Mrs. McCormick Receives Laetare Medal 
First Woman Member of New York "Times" Editorial Board Honored; Widely Recognized as Outstanding Foreign Correspondent; Winner of the Pulitzer Prize. 
Anne O'Hare McCormick, distin­guished writer and foreign correspon­dent, was announced on March 19 as the recipient of the Laetare Medal, awarded annually since 1883 by the University of "Notre Dame to an outstanding mem­ber of the Catholic laity in the United States.: 
Rev. J. Hugh O'Donnell, C.S.C, pres­ident of the University, in announcing the selection of this year's medalist, said: "The Laetare Medal for 1944 is awarded to Anne O'Hare McCormick, distinguished journalist and foreign correspondent of the Neto York Times. Her brilliant reporting of national and international events of history in the making has been enriched by a clarity and vision that has given her preemi­nence in that field, as evidenced by the fact that she was the first woman to be awarded the Pulitzer Prize in Journal­ism. Yet Mrs. McCormick has accepted all. honors with a gracious modesty so characteristic of the noble woman whose faith in God inspires her to great heights in the pursuit of truth." 
Mrs. McCormick, 14th woman to re­ceive the Laetare Medal, has been a member of the Neio York Times staff since 1921, and in 1936 she became the first woman to achieve a place on the editorial board of the Times. She is gen­erally recognized as one of the outstand­ing foreign correspondents of her gen­eration, and she is an authority on Eu­ropean political affairs. 
Mrs. McCormick was bom in England and spent much of her childhood travel­ing on the Continent before coming to the United States. She received her B.A. degree from St. Mary's College, Colum­bus, O., and several years later she was married to Francis J. McCormick, Day­ton, O., manufacturer. 
Mrs. McCormick and her husband traveled extensively, and in 1921 she began her articles for the Times when she wrote the first account of the rise of Fascism in Italy. During the next few years her ability to "be on the spot" when big events were breaking estab­lished her reputation in the newspaper field. 
In 1937 Mrs. McCormick won the Pulitzer Prize for distinguished foreign correspondence. She was selected as "Woman of 1939" by prominent wom­en's organizations. 
The time and place of the presenta­tion of the Laetare Medal to Mrs. Mc­Cormick will be announced at a later date. 
The Laetare Medal was established in 1883 at the University as an annual recognition among the Catholic laity in the United States. John Gilmary Shea, famous historian, was the first to re-
ANNE O'HARE MCCORMICK 
ceive the award. The first woman to be selected as a recipient was art critic Eliza Allen Starr, who received the medal in 1885. 
The 1943 award went to Thomas F. Woodlock, New York author and editor of the Wall Street Journal. 



BREEN MEDAL TO LYNCH 
Pvt. John F. Lynch, a Marine V-12 trainee from Green Bay, Wis., won the Breen Medal for Oratory on Feb. 8. He is the son of Robert E. Lynch, '03, who was a Breen Medal finalist in 1903. It was the first time that the medal was won by a member of the armed forces. 
HONOR POPE PIUS XII 
The fifth anniversary of the corona­tion of Pope Pins XII was especially observed at. Notre Dame on March 12 with a solen^.Mass celebrated by Rev. John J. Cavanangh, C.S.C, vice-presi­dent of the University, in Sacred Heart Church. The sermons at the fonr stu­dent Masses of the day were preached by Rev. Patrick J. Carroll, C.S.C, edi­tor of The Ave Maria, and by Rev. Arthnr J. Hope, C.S.C, assistant editor and author of the centenary volnme, Notre Dame—100 Keors. Both of the priests dwelt upon the Pope's labors and perils during the present war. 
The intentions of the Sovereign Pon­tiff, who is also a Notre Dame alnm­nns, were additionally remonbered all throng^ the remainder of Lent as daily adoration of the Blessed Sacrament was conducted as usual in Sacred He^grt Church, closing each day with Benedic­tion of the' Blessed Sacrament. Many of those who prayed before the Blessed Sacrament in half-hour watches were local members of the armed forces in uniform. 
Special recognition of Notre Darnels concern for the welfare of the Pope came in a special message to Rev. Hn ^ O'Donnell, C.S.C, president, from Most Rev. Amleto G. Cicognani, archbishop of Laodicea and apostolic delegate to the United States. Archbishop Cicog­nani wrote: 
"Your expressions of devotion and loyalty to the Holy Father on the part of the faculty, alumni and students of the University of Notre Dame will, I am sure, be a source of great consola­tion and encouragement to His Holiness in this time of trial and sorrow. 
"The pledge of the University will be forwarded to the Sovereign Pontiff, and in his name, I wish to thank you for the program that has been followed at Notre Dame in honor of the Holy Father and for the many prayers that have been offered for his intention. 

"With sentiments of esteem and every best tvish, I remain." 


SfuUliflU AUumU 

/^N E of the greatest construction 
achievements of this war was com­pleted within the past year. The project, at Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., consisted of the removal of the old Weitzel Lock, 
JAMES A. DUBBS, '06 

built in 1881, and the construction in its place of the new MacArthur Lock. The completion of this $14,000,000 ship lock in 14 months established a new record for this type of construction. 
The contracts for this project were all awarded to the Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Company and work was started in April, 1942. The lock was completed by the end of June, 1943, and the first boat was locked through on July 4, 1943. James A. Dubbs, '06, vice-president and manager of the Cleveland Division of the Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Com­pany, was the man selected to head the organization entrusted with the task of building the structure. The work includ­ed the blasting and removal of 500,000 cubic yards of rock and earth, the re­
moval of the masonry walls of the old lock, the construction of cofferdams 2600 feet long and 250 feet wide, and, finally, the construction of ths new lock proper. This consisted mainly of mixing and placing 200,000 cubic yards of con­crete from October 1,1942 right through the winter months until June, 1943. Any 
one familiar with Soo wnters, where tonperatures reach 30 degrees below zero, can appreciate the enormity of the task. For the successful completion of this huge project ahead of schedule, the organization was awarded the Army-Navy "E." 
Mr. Dubbs was graduated from Notre Dame as a civil engineer. Shortly after his graduation he started with the Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Company, as one of the first engineers hired by the com­pany. After spending some time in Chi-Dame, Mr. Dubbs has been an active Buffalo and later to Clevdand, where he held successively the positions of divi­sion engineer, superintendent, assistant general superintendent, assistant mana­ger, and then manager and vice-presi­dent. 
Always vitally interested in Notre Dame, Mr. Dubbs has been an active member of the Cleveland Club of Notre Dame. He has worked on various com­mittees, and at present is a member of the Scholarship Fund Committee and the Annual Retreat Committee. He is also the representative of his class for the Alumni Fund.

FIRST DEATH ON MARCH 6 
The first midshipman to die at the United States Naval Reserve Midship­men School at Notre Dame was Kenneth 
A. Anderson, 21 years old, Beverly Hills, Calif. He died on March 6 after a short illness. Kenneth had attended Stanford University, Palo .Alto, Calif., before he entered midshipmen training. His broth­er, Sherman F, Anderson, was graduated with the Notre Dame midshipmen class of Jan. 20, 1944. 

CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL AWARD

The Notre Dame Alumnus 
Lay Faculty in Service 
War has claimed thousands of alumni, literally. The number changes daily, but is approximately 5,000 at the present writing. We have already lost 90 alum­ni through death in service, as against 56 total in World War I. ' 
The ALUMNUS would like to call at­tention to a less startling but significant phase of the war — the impact on the University faculty. Following is a list of men who were members of the Uni­versity faculty in the fall of 1941, or after, who have subsequently entered the armed forces. (The list excludes the chaplains, who were listed in the last issue of the ALUMNUS, with the excep­ception of Rev. Robert Waide, C.S.C., '33, Canadian Army, whose name was inadvertently omitted. There are now 23 Holy Cross chaplains serving.)

Stritch, Navy 
In addition to these men in active service, the University faculty has con­tributed substantially to government re­search, some of it in laboratories away from Notre Dame, some of it in the University's own laboratories. Because of the secret nature of the work, the men and the time being devoted to the projects are not available for publi­cation. 
CHAPLAINS LAND ON MARSHALLS 
Two C.S.C. chaplains with the armed forces were with United States troops who made landings on the Marshall Is­lands earlier in the year. They were Rev. John Dupuis and Rev. Francis D. Bridenstine. 
N. D. Welcomes Hering Gifts 
Mrs. Herins's Generosity Recalls Deeds of Late Frank E. Hering. 
One of Notre Dame's great alumni, Frank E. Hering, Litt.B. '98, LL.B. '02, first football coach, outstanding athlete and scholar, and later in life the na­tional president of the Alumni Associa­tion and a member of the Board of Lay Trustees, is appropriately commemor­ated in the University art galleries through the generous gifts of his widow, Mrs. Claribel Hering, which include a bust and a group of significant medals. 
Mr. Hering, at the time of his death, was the long time nationally known edi­tor of the Eagle Magazine. In that prom­inent post he had fathered Mothers' Day. A tablet in English Opera House, Indianapolis, commemorates his address launching this monument in 1904. Mr. Hering was also decorated in 1929 by the War Mothers of America for his pioneering in this setting aside of a day each year to honor American mothers. He had championed old age pensions through successive legislative channels, and he was outstanding in active fields of social justice. The four medals in the collection include one given by Montana, in recognition of its old age pension 
success, and an honorary service medal from the Veterans of Foreign Wan. They represent Mr. Hering's recognized leadership and his distinguished services to America during World War I. 
The bust is an excellent bronze, made in 1929, just before Mr. Hering's presi­dency of the Alumni Association, by Emory P. Seidel. 
Mr. Hering, who died on July 11, 1943, came to Notre Dame from the University of Chicago. He played on, captained, and coached the football team in 1896, and ronained in graduate study and coaching for three more years to establish a strong varsity football tra­dition. At the same time, he was a prom­ising writer, and the Scholastic of those years bears evidence of the power of style which marked his later editorial prominence. 
Mrs. Hering^'s thoughtful gift brings to Notre Dame tangible recollections of an alumnus already enshrined in the memory of the University and alumni who knew him through his long years of loyal devotion. 
Kennedy Co-ordinates Publicity Progrann 
In a reorganization of the publicity department of the University, Rev. Hugh O'Donnell, C.S.C, president, has announced the appointment of J. Wal­ter Kennedy, '34, as the head of a new department which will coordinate all of the publicity channels of the Univer­sity. Walt, a Stamford, Conn., man, has a background of experience as publicist, newspaper writer, publishers' represen­tative, and author. In July, 1943, he suc­ceeded Joseph Petritz, '32, as sports publicity director at Notre Dame, when Petritz, nationally known figure in sports ^vriting, accepted a commission in the Navy. 
In the handling of general publicity, Walt took over for James E. Armstrong, '25, who had been in charge since 1941. Jim returns to full time work with the-Alumni Association. 
In another move, designed too to sup­port the vastly increased activities of the Alumni Association, Father O'Don­nell announced the appointment of Rev. Charles M. Carey, C.S.C, '30, as gen­eral director of all activities of the Scholastic. Heretofore, William R. Dool­ey, '26, was in charge of the business phases of the student weekly, with Father Carey as editorial advisor to the staff. Bill is thus released to serve full time as assistant alumni secretary and managing editor of the ALUMNUS. 
The Dome, yearbook, and Sa-ip, stu­dent literary magazine, have both sus­pended publication for the duration of the war. The latest issue of the Dome was in December,. 1942, and Scrip had its final issue in April, 1943.

Placement Committee Is Formed in industry and, later, with widespread 
B.J. Veil. '17, Named Qair­
man: Work 

Formation of a committee wdthin the Alumni Association to study Notre Dame personnel placement activities, past, present and future, was announced in March by President Thomas F. Byrne in accordance with a previous directive of the Association directors. 
Heading the committee as chairman is Bernard J. Voll, '17, South Bend, presi­dent of the Sibley Machine and Foundry Corp. Mr. Voll, lay trustee of the Uni­versity, is secretary of his class and is a past president of the Alumni Associa­tion. He has for many years been active­ly interested in the placement of Notre Dame men and in promoting plans for such activity within the association. 
Other members of the committee are William C. Schmitt, '10, Portland, Ore.; Clyde E. Broussard, '13, Beaumont, Texas; John T. Balfe '20, New York City; Daniel H. Young, '22, Philadelphia; Joseph F. Donaldson, '23, Louisville; Ed­ward F. O'Toole, '25, Chicago; Clayton 
G. Leroux, '27, Cleveland; John W. Brennan, '27, Detroit, and John F. Mc­Mahon, '28, Pittsburgh. Acting as secre­tary of the group is William R. Dooley, '26, assistant secretary of the Alumni Association. 
To facilitate work and hasten plan-making, the chairman of the committee la s divided its inquiry into two main channels: undergraduate (senior) place­ment and graduate (alumni) placement. Further, he has suggested that the com­mittee study, first, what the Association has already done and is doing in place­ment and, secondly, what should be done in the future, particularly for the vet-* erans returning from the military ser­vices. 
To assist in gathering information on which to base recommendations. Bill 
 Is Divided. 
BEENABO J. VOLL, '17 

Dooley within the past month has trav­eled to Purdue, DePauw, Indiana, and Northwestern universities, to hold dis­cussions with the placement director in each school. On the basis of these con­versations and other studies, Mr. Voll has written to each member of his com­mittee, asking, for comments and sug­gestions and for investigations as to placement activities at schools within the home areas of the individual commit­tee members. 
When all data has been assembled, Mr. Voll and the committee will present rec­ommendations on placement to the di­rectors of the Alumni Association. 
The Association has been active in placement work since 1938, when a Placement Bureau was formed, with Bill Dooley in charge on the campus and many members of the present committee service in the armed forces, placement activity within the Association has, of course, substantially decreased. Remain­ing until the recent draft directives were many contacts with industries which sent representatives to the campus in search of technical graduates.

ATHLETICS 
FOOTBALL 
In preparation for one of the most attractive schedules Notre Dame has had in some years, the Fighting Irish grid­ders started spring practice on St. Pat­rick's day, to continue for four weeks. 
Although very few of them will be on hand for the fall season, 103 aspirants turned out for the opening drill. Only a handful of lettermen were on hand, and of these only three—tackles John Adams and George Sullivan, and quarterback Frank Dancfiwicz—^are reasonably sure of playing during the 1944 season. 
In the absence of Frank Leahy, as­sistant coach Ed McKeever was in charge of the spring practice. He was assisted by Hugh Devore and Wally Ziemba, of last year's staff, and by George Wilson, end on the Chicago Bears, who helped out during the work­outs. 
The complete 1944 schedule follows: 
Sept. 30—Eittsbnrxh at Pittsborxh 
Oct. 7—^Tulane at Notre Dame 
Oct. 14—^Dartmouth at Boston 
-. Oct. 21—^Wisconsin at Notre Dame 
Oct. 28—^IllinoU at Champaign 
Nor. 4—Navy at Baltimore 
Nov. 11—^Armjr at New York 
Nov. 18—Northwestern at Notre Dame 
Nov. 25—Georcia Tech at AtlanU 
Dec. 2—Great Lakes at Notre Dame 
BASEBALL 
Coach Jake Kline began his 11th year as head coach of the Notre Dame baseball team on March 13, when he called the first practice of the season. One hundred and five hopefuls answered, one of the largest baseball turnouts in Irish history. 
With one of the most ambitious sched­ules in the school's history arranged. Coach Kline was faced with the pros­pect of re-building his ball club, all but three of last year's lettermen having departed from the campus. Holdovers are Tommy Sheehan, catcher; Bob Klein, shortstop; and Tom Carlin, sec­ond baseman, all members of the Navy V-12 program. 
Included in the 105 candidates were a number of players from other schools, transferred ix> Notre Dame under the Navy lend-lease-for-educational-purposes program. Among this group were four who played with the informal Irish nine last summer: outfielders Scarpelli and

comeb of baiketball and line coach 
in football, left early in March for 
i Quantico, Va., to begin his train­
ing as a second lieutenant in the 
Marines. Ed had earlier been com­

i but he was allowed to resign this

1 fered him an opportunity with

Mayo, third baseman Manarik, and pitcher Zieminski. 
Coach Kline, after almost a month of watching his charges, has his mind made up as to the abilities, and except for the first base position, he has his start­ing lineup pretty well set. Shedian will do most of the catching, and will be spelled by Hudson Mealy, a Marine transfer, who caught last spring for Minnesota. Phil Keither and Carl Mar­shall, both Marine imports, are still battling for the first base job, and Jake will, after the season gets imder way, hand the spot to the better hitter. Tom Carlin is pretty sure of the second Back­er's job, and Bob Klein has shortstop clinched. Klein led the summer nine at the bat in 1943, with a .450 average. Third base will be handled by Ken Man­arik, inherited from Great Lakes Naval Training Station.­
Six men are leading the race for the outfield jobs. Diminutive Len Scarpelli, a Marine transfer from Santa Clara, who has had some minor league experi­ence, seems to be set in left field. Jack Mayo, - heavy hitting Marine transfer from Washington University in St. Louis, probably will be in right field. Frank Gilhooley, civilian sophomore from Toledo, O., whose father, "Flash" Gilhooley, was one of the greatest base stealers in big league history, may land the center field post. Also in the run­ning are AI Whittingham, a civilian transfer from Ohio State, where he 
played regularly last year; Jim Flana­gan of the Navy ^-12, an end on the . 1943 football team; and Leo Klier, bas­ketball star, who also donbles in brass 
as a pitcher. 
Heading the pitching staff is Joe Zie­minski, a Marine transfer from the Uni­versity of Illinois, who hails from West. Springfield, Mass., home town of Angdo Bertelli. Zioninski hurled for the sum­mer nine last year, and showed enoa^^ promise to assure Kline of a good num­ber-one man on his staff. Bill Martin,' an honest-to-goodness Notre Damer, now in the Navy V-12, and civilian Eldon ' "Lefty" O'Brien are expected to round out the top trio of hurlers with Zie­minski.

BASKETBALL 
. The Irish closed the court season on March 3, losing to Camp Grant in the Chicago Stadium by a 63-47 score; The season's record of ten wins and nine losses was not as fruitful as other years, but before the courtsters palled the cur­tain down on the 1943-44 schedule, they covered themselves with lots of s^ory. both individually and collectively.. 
First of all, Leo Klier, brilliant for­ward, established an all-time Notre Dame record by scoring 293 points in. the 19 games on the schedule. This broke Johnny Moir's record of 290 points, scored in 22 games, during the 1936-37 season. Klier established himself as one' of the all-time Notre Dame, greats' by netting 22 points in the final game of the season, to break the record. The heat was on terrifically, but the Washmgtnn, Ind., boy, a Navy V-12 omdidate^ proved his ability by dropping in-11 points in each half. 
On Feb. 9, at the Great Lakes 'Ifaval Training station, the Great Lakes team. 

probably the best in the nation, inflicted an 84-48 defeat on the Irish. They scored the most points ever scored against Notre Dame in basketball, and tied the worst defeat—36 points,—in­flicted by Syracuse in 1914. Ten days later, the aroused Notre Dame five, play­ing like men inspired, got ample re­venge by turning back the Great Lakes team in the Chicago Stadium by a 54­51 score, in one of the greatest upsets of the season. The defeat broke the Sailors' 22-game win streak. 
TRACK 
The Irish track team, under Coach Elvin "Doc" Handy, finished the indoor season on March 25, when they partici­pated in the annual Purdue Relays. Hampered by injuries, withdrawals, and military transfers. Coach Handy had his troubles throughout the entire ivin­ter, and managed to win a dual meet and a triangular, and lose two duals and a triangular. 
Highlight of the season was on Feb. 26, when big John Yonakor, shot putter, won the national AATJ crown in New York City, ivith a toss of 50 feet 2% inches. 
Frank Martin, distance star, was the big gun during the season. Martin, a New York boy, and enrolled in the Navy V-12, was Handy's iron man, running in the 880, mile and two mile. Best two miler in the midwest, he also scored heavily for the Irish in his other spe­cialties. 
• TENNIS 
If Walter Langford, University tennis -coach, is smiling more than usual, it is because there are about 101 mentors in America who would like to have either Chuck Sampson or Jerry Evert on their tennis squads. 
You've guessed the reason already — Langford has both Sampson and Evert, and his only difiiculty, at present, is de­ciding which of the lads will occupy the number one berth on the Irish net team. 
By way of introduction, Sampson is the hard driving Wichita, Kans., boy who last spring played the number two slot for Ohio State and led the Notre Dame summer team when he came here with the V-12. Jerry Evert is the young­er partner of the Evert tennis family. The senior member of the firm will be re­monbered as Jimmy Evert, who led the Irish tennis squad last year and who currently is ranked as nxmiber 11 in the United States.

THE NEW PATTERN 

The campus is well established in the new pattern of things. The preponder­ance of uniformed students is taken for granted. "Hup, two, three, four" is ac­cepted without a second thought. We can hardly remember the days when the Dining Hall had waiters (it's been all cafeteria for a long time now). The coming and the going, every four months, of new classes of midshipmen are taken in stride by the "natives." 
But we can't quite settle down and get 

used to one thing — girl clerks in the 
Huddle (candy store to you guys before ' 1935 or so). It just isn't — it just isn't the old place any more. Shades of Brother "Leep!"

HELPS RED CROSS 
The Notre Dame Club of Indt-' anapolis tried tomethins new re­cently, and it worked—with mas> nificent consequence* all around. 
At the suKgestion of Walter StnUdreher, president of the club, 66 members volunteered to serre as solicitors in the industrial di­vision of the annual American Red Cross campaign. Divided into 11 teams, these member* were concerned with 90,000 employes working in 138 local plants. 
Many members of the club are, of course, in the armed services. Those remaining on the "home front" agreed that they could give valuable service to the war effort —and to their fellow club mem­bers—by assisting the Red Cross. 
They did!

FOR GOD. COUNTRY. NOTRE DAME 
IN GLORY EVERLASTING 
PREVIOUSLY REPORTED Dead Missing Captured 82 16 10 
1st Lt. Donald B. McNally, '42, 
Win­

netka. 111., reported in the February, 1944, ALUMNUS as "missing in action," is now know-n to have been killed in ac­tion over France on Nov. 15. The later tragic news was received by his parents in late March. 
Don enlisted in the Army Air Forces in June, 1942, and was commissioned in February, 1943. He had been overseas since June 20, 1943, and was the recipi­ent of the Air Medal. He was a Thun­derbolt fighter pilot. 
Surviving Don besides his parents are two brothers and two sisters. 
Lt. Robert G. Smith, '42, Joliet, HI., Marine flyer, outstanding basketball guard at Notre Dame for three years, 
is the first Notre Dame monogram man 
to be killed in action in the present war. (Major Vincent F. Harrington, '25, monogram-winning football guard, pre­viously died from a heart attack in Eng­land. The distinction, "killed in action," is therefore important with regard to Bob Smith.) 
Bob lost his life in the South Pacific according to word received by his par­ents on March 3. Commissioned at Cor­pus Christi, Texas, in March, 1943, he was assigned to Pacific duty last Octo­be and had seen considerable combat service. 
Bob was one of the highest scoring guards in Notre Dame basketball his­tory, getting 134 points in his senior year and winning all-opponent honors on several teams chosen by opponents of that year. 

Lt. (jg) Charles H. Deger, '42, Day­ton, O., died of pneumonia on Feb. 20 in the Southwest Pacific area, the third 
member of his class announced as giving his life in the service since the Febru­ary AlUMNUS was published. 
Charlie enlisted in the Navy and was commissioned an ensign while he was still at Notre Dame. In the fall of 1942 he was sent to the naval supply depot in Brooklyn and was later at Harvard for four months of training. He went over­seas in June, 1943. 
Charlie's mother and a brother and sister survive him. He was buried in a military cemetery near his station, with Ensign Bill Fallon, '42, as one of the pallbearers. 
Sgt John K. Walsh, e.\. '43, Denver, of the United States Marines, was killed recently in the Pacific area. 
At Notre Dame for only a short per­iod in the 1939-40 year, John was later an assistant to Father Flanagan at Boys Town, Nebr. He had been boys' director and coach at St. Clara Orphan­age, Denver, and had assisted in the same sort of work in various settlement houses and camps. He was particularly known as a devoted friend of under­privileged boys. 
A page from the Denver Rocky Moun­tain News of March 24, forwarded by Father Ed Murray, C.S.C, chaplain at Camp Carson, Colo., contains a unique and beautiful tribute to John written by his brother Bill. 
Lt. Homer W. Ferguson, '41, Win­slow, Ariz., was killed on Feb. 8 when a huge cargo plane he was piloting crashed on a hill and burned, about 30 miles southwest of Nashville, Tenn. Four others in the plane were killed in the same accident.

Homer, graduated magna cum laude from Notre Dame, joined the Army Air Forces in 1942 and received his silver wings on June 26, 1943, after his train­ing in several Texas flying schools. Just before he was commissioned he crashed on a Texas mountain top, having become lost in a storm, but miraculously es­caped with a few scratches. 
Aviation Cadet Thomas J. McQuaid, 
ex. '46, Rochester, N. Y., was killed re­cently in a training crash at Hondo Field, San Antonio, Texas. He was to have been graduated from a navigator's school on April 8. 
Tom, like Lt. George Eberhart, ex. '46, who was killed about the same time, came to Notre Dame in 1942 and en­listed in the Army Air Forces in March, 1943. He had been trained at Ellington Field and at Harlington Field, both in Texas, before being transferred to Hon­do Field. 
2ND LT. GEORGE P. EBERHART, HI, ex. '46 
2nd Lt. George F. Eberhart, III, ex. '46, Mishawaka, Ind., was killed in an airplane crash in Panama on Feb. 28. 
Entering Notre Dame in September, 1942, George soon enlisted in the Army Air Forces and left for training on March 9, 1943. He was commissioned at Victoria, Texas, on Jan. 7, 1944, and assigned to a Caribbean command. 
George's parents and two sisters sur­vive him.

Qeveland Qub Does Things 
Take Four Days of April I. 2. 3. 4 
Your Alumni Secretary had the pleasure on April 1, 2, 3 and 4, of see­ing in action the smoothest Local Alum­ni Club over the years that has graced our roster — Cleveland. (I can hear the boys from coast to coast, but as one of our Laetare Medalist said, lef s look at the record.) 
On Sunday morning, April 2, an ex­cellent program was held in commemo­ration of Knute K. Rockne. It started at a Mass, celebrated by a Notre Dame alumnus-priest. A breakfast followed at the University when 150 fathers and sons sat down together and later heard from a program featured by the direc­tor of athletics and the head football coach from the United States Naval Academy. (Names will undoubtedly ap­pear in the Club's own story. This is for a different purpose.) . 
The entire day following was one round of hospitality in the homes of in­dividual members of the Club, culminat­ing in a dinner at a country club for the Navy men before they caught their train.' 
Then, on Tuesday night, the Club en­tertained through its officers and a com­mittee, the Notre Dame delegates to the national convention of the American Chemical Society. About 35 were pres­ent The Club, contrary to the -wishes of the delegates, made the dinner com­plimentary. Guests included three hi ^ ranking chonists from the DuPont re­search organization, and the editor of three of the leading chemical journals. A former Cleveland alumnus and chem­ist, now with .the WPB, gave the prin­cipal address. Obviously an affair of distinction and importance for the Uni­versity, and a highlight in Club cooper­ation. 
On the same night, in the same hotel, a large committee of the Club members, and their -wi-ves, officially on the com­mittee, met to discuss plans for Univer­sal Notre Dame Night, when 100 moth­ers and wives of the Cleveland men in service are to be entertained. 
A check for $1,000 had been sent in to Notre Dame as the annual Club scholarship contribution, and the Club is planning a drive similar to the St. Joe Valley's drive for the Second Annu­al Alumni Fund. 
This record is too good to hold back from thtf rest of you.

Deaths 
Sudden death on March 2 toc^ from Notre Dame Rer. James D. Trahey, C.S.C.> '30, aged 37, since 1941 administrative assistant and co­
ordinator of war training classes. 
Father Trahey had undergone an emer­gency appendectomy on Feb. 25 in St. Joseph's Hospital, South Bend. Am>ar­ently recovering sat­isfactorily from this oi>eration. h e me t death almost with­out warning as the result o f coronary thrombosis. 
Among the stu­dents of recent years Father Trahey wta unquestionably one of 
Father Trahey the most widel y 

known, and one of the most popular, priests on the campus. Beomi­ing prefect of discipline in 1937, he served in that oflSce until 1941, when, with the coming of intensive national defense efforts, he was ap­pointed by the president of the University as administrative assistant to act especially as liaison officer between the University and newly estab­lished Naval R.O.T.C. unit 
As the war effort expanded Father Trahey gen­erously expanded the scope of his work, becom­ing the chief advisor to innumerable students on matters concerned with their service in the armed forces. From his offices in the Engineering Building he had charge locally through 1941-42­43 of the various enlistment programs that were carried 1^ the Army, Navy and Marines and he became known to numerous officers in all these service 

With the beginning of the engineering, science and management war training night classes, con­ducted at Notre Dame and elsewhere under gov­ernment sponsorship. Father Trahey was chosen to be the insUtutional representative in charge locally. In this capacity he became known to the hundreds who have taken, and are taking, such classes. 
In all these positions. Father Trahey was ad­mired and respected as an administrator of out­standing ability and as a personality of excep­tional appeal. Big — six feet four inches — smiling and friendly, he gave of himself to everybody else, ^ e success of the various serv­ice programs at Notre Dame is, in considerable measure, due to him. 
Speaking of him. Father Hugh O'Donnell, C.S.C., president of the University, said: 
"Many Notre Dame men who were here before the war knew Father Trahey best as the prefect of discipline: students of the last three years frecpiently turned to him as the special counselor on military questions in which capacity he was also known by many officers of the army, navy and marines. To hundreds of representatives of industry in this area. Father Trahey was admired as the 'institutional representative in charge of the night classes in the E.S.M.W.T. program. I am sure that all who ever knew Father Trahey wl l join the administration and faculty in raooming him as an exemplary priest, an able executive and a wise and kind friend. 
'Tersonally, I feel his loss keenly, and to his beloved parents I express heartfelt and p'rayerful ^rrapathy." 
Father TVahey was bom on April 7, 1906, in Michigan City, Ind., the only child of Mr, and Mrs. Dennis Trahey, who survive. Following his ordination, he became an instructor in English and in religion at Notre Dame, and later became an as^stant prefect of discipline, serving as such until he became prefect of discipline in 1937; 
Father O'Donnell celebrated the solemn requiem funeral Mass for Father Trahey on March 4 in Sacred Heart Church, Notre Dame. Rev. Charles 
F. Giraidot, -the deacon, pastor of S t Joseph's Chnrdi, Fort Wayne, Ind, and Rev. Gerald A. Owens, the sub-deacon, pastor of St Basil's Churdi, South Haven. Mich., were close friends of Father Trahey. Rev. Leo W. Gorman. C.S.C., was master of ceremonies. 
Pallbearers were Rev. John Burke. C.S.a, Rev. John Lane, GS.C., Rev. Charles Carey, C.9.O.. Rev. Henry Bolger, C.S.a, and Rev. Joseph Powers, C.S.C.. all of Notre Dame, and Rev. John O'Connell, C.S.C., of Indianapolis. 
ThoHiu E. Mills, 60 years old. one of the most 
popular figures ever connected with Notre Dame 
athletics, died suddenly of a heart attack on Feb. 
25 in the shower room of 
the R o c k n e Memorial 
fleldhouse, of which he 
had been director since 
1939. 
Mr. Mills, known wide­
ly as Tommy, is sur\'ived 
by two sons, SlSgt, Thom­
as E., Jr., '42. who a few 
days before his father's 
death returned from duty 
Tommy Mills 
with the Army in North Africa, and by Robert, in the Army at Fort Sill. Okla., es well cs by a daughter, Maura, with whom Tommy made his home in South Bend* His wife died in 1932. 
Born in Beloit, Wis.. Tommy was graduated from Beloit College, where he played halfback on the football team and captained the baseball team. Entering the law school of the University of AVisconsin in 1907, he left there in his senior year upon the death of his father. In 1915 he succeeded Harry (Red) Miller, '10, as head coach of football and basketball at Creighton Univer­sity, Omaha. Nebr., and in his four years there enjoyed remarkable success, his basketball teams winning 72 out of 76 games and his football teams being unbeaten in two years. 
Tommy returned to Beloit College as head coach of football and basketball in 1920 and in his six years there his teams continued to be outstand­ing, so much so that after his squad held Notre Dame to a 19-3 score in 1925, Knute Rockne signed him up as assistant in football and chief scout Coming to Notre Dame in 1926, Tommy was made head baseball coach the following spring. 
In 1930 Tommy left Kotre Dame to become head football coach at Georgetown University. "Washington, D. C , and one of his early acts there was to sign Frank Leahy cs his line coach —Frank's first coaching job. In 1933, Cor.ch Mills took over football at Arkansas State College and was head of the school's department of speech. 
In 1935 he became a sports commentator for the National Broadcnsting Co., but returned to Notre Dame in 1036 as a teacher of speech, having given up active coaching. On March 1. 1939, he was appointed by Rev. John F. O'Hara. C.S.C., then president of the University, as first director of the newly-opened Rockne Memorial Fieldhouse and had ser\-ed in that capacity con­tinuously until his death. 

Tommy was buried on Feb. 29 in Beloit after a solemn requiem funeral Mass for him in St. lliomas* Church there ct which Rev- William Craddick. C-S.C.. prefect of religion, was deacon. Rev. Thomas Brennan, C.S.C.. preached the fun­eral sermon. Two of the pallbearers were Frank Leahy, athletic director and head football coach at Notre Dame, and Edward McKeever, assistant football coach. 
Rev. Hugh O'Donnell. president of the Univer­sity, praised Tommy in the following words: 
"Hie campus was saddened by the death of Mr. Thomas Mills, a member of the faculty for many years, and latterly director of the Rockne Me­morial. In both capacities he acquitted himself with a fidelity that won for him the admiration and respect of administration, faculty and stu­dents. He will be missed at the University of his adoption whose ideals were an integral part of his life Peace to his noble soul."

From Bemie VoU: 
A little sojourn in the East brought me into contact with some of our classmates and other Notre Dame men. 
On two occasions in New York City I had lunch wnth Oscar J. Dorwin, who heads up the legal department of the Texas Company. It was something like old times to sit down for a couple of hours and talk about the many things which we were mutually interested in, including many of the old classmates. 
In Washington I had dinner with James D. Hmyes who is still one of the top men in the Veterans Administration and looks to me like the perennial college man. Neither Oscar nor Jim seems to me to show the wear and tear of the past 25 years comparable to what some of the rest of ns show. 

Another day I had lunch with Congressmen Joe O'Harm from Minnesota, and Bob Grant of South Bend- They had invited Lt. Col. B. G. Du­bois who taught French for some 20 years at the University and who for the past 30 months had been in the Panama Canal Zone. 
The Colonel looked as though Army life had agreed with bim even though he had had such a long period of foreign ser\'ice. Currently he is assigned in Washington and expects to be there for some tima Also at the lunch was A. A. For­tier, '30, formerly of South Bend, who is associ­ated with the Rolls-Royce, Inc., Detroit. 
ITie day I returned home Bill Andres of the old battery combination of Dorwin and Andres stopped in to see me. Bill's boy, who is stationed at Great Lakes, was getting married to a South Bend girl and Bill took the opportunity to renew some old friendships around this territory. Besides the boy at Great Lakes he has one in the Air Corps, a daughter who is married to a ser\*ice man, and one daughter still at home. 
A clipping from Colorado Springs paper ap­peared on my desk the other day announcing the marriage of Carleton D. Beh to Miss Clare C Foley. Congratulations and best wishes to the Beh's from all the *17ers, 
I've recently talked with Torn McAIanus who, unfortunately, had had to spend some time in Hines Hospital, near Chicago. Tom is feeling good now and is back with his Chicago law practice.

MAJOR GEN. FRANCIS P, MULCAHY, '14 
Promoted recently to the rank of major general in recognition of his bril­liant achievement in the Pacific warfare was Francis P. Mulcahy, '14, of the Ma­rine Corps. As Brig. Gen. Mulcahy he was in charge of air operations in the American campaign against the Ne w Georgia Islands and was one of the first Americans to land on Rendova Island. 
Entering the Marines as a buck pri­vate in World War I and rising to his present eminence by outstanding ac­complishment, General Mulcahy is one 
of the real veterans of air operations. 
his daughters will soon be ready to join the 
U.S. Cadet Nurses Corps and the other is attend­ing Buffalo SUte Teachers College. Tom Kelly continues with law practice at 806 N. llth St., Alilwaukee. 
Edward Joseph Rcj-nolds, a surgeon in Maiden, Mass., was, at the latest report, ser%*ing with the armed forces at Lido Beach, X*.I.. N. Y. Also there, at the same latest report, was Lt. Frank Boland, a chaplain. 
Father Francis P. Monighan is pastor of St. Mary's Church, Isabel, S. D. He writes that the most interesting thing that happened to him dur­ing 1943 was that he received his full salary for the first time since he went there in 1921. How­ever, he is happy in the number at Mass and the number receiving the Sacraments regularly. Isabel has experienced another terrible winter. 
Clarence Brown has been with the Michigan State Highway Department for 24 years. For the past three years he has been working on the Wil­low Run network of highways and on the Detroit Industrial Expressway, the biggest project of its kind as an excess road to industry in the United States in the past year.

Writing to Dan from the headquarters of the Ninth Service Command, Room 267. BIdg. 105, Fort Douglas, Utah, Lt. CoL Joe Tiemey says in part: "Casually perusing an 'Alumnus,' I found the first *21 note that I have seen in several years, so, since I'm one of the people probably responsible for the lack of news, I hasten to send a few lines. I became a 'retread' in September of 1942, leaving the assistant-directorship of the New York State Employment Service to enter the Labor Branch, Army Service Forces. After about six months* duty in the Second Service Command at N.Y.C, I was transferred here in February, 1943. Since that time I have traveled some 85,000 miles through the eight states in the Command, working in strikes and labor supply problems and, so far as I can guess, I'll be doing the same work for the duration. 
"Recently business in Chicago and Washing­ton. D. C , gave me opportunity to see Gerald Ashe in Chicago, John Balfe* Father George Fischer, C.S.C., and Ed Gottry in N.Y.C. as well as my family who are still at Bayside, L.I. I saw my oldest daughter, who is a Sister of S t Joseph in Rochester, N. Y., and my oldest boy, who is in Moreau Seminary at Notre Dame, doing his third-year stint. Dean McCarthy and I had lunch and discussed industrial relations at length and. in spite of a cold wind, I plowed over the whole campus to see the magnificent changes that have taken place since '17 to *21. 
"Capt. Eugene Kennedy, '22, is stationed here, and, in spite of 22 years, we quickly recognized each other last February when we first met again. Joe Maag wrote me from St. Louis back in January, and I hope to see him on some fu­ture trip East. Father Tom Tobin, chancellor of the Portland diocese, writes me from time to time, and I've seen him there several times. If any of our classmates are out in these eight states — California, Oregon, Washington, Mon­tana, Idaho, Utah, Nevada and Arizona — I'd like to see them in my wanderings. I also go to Denver from time to time. . . - Perhaps if this war is over in time, we can lay plans for a re­union in 1946 to celebrate our silver anniversary. 
". . . I'm enclosing an Air Force public rela­tions photograph for your benefit. As I recall it, I was introducing Rosie, the Riveter, on some morale show at the time — you* can see that war is hell at times, but still it's better than double­quicking down to South Bend to stand at parade rest in the November rain while Lt. Turk of the SA'TC went into his girl's house for a cup of breakfast coffee." 
Says Dan, in forwarding Joe's letter and pic­

ture: "I don't %%'ant this to be said out loud so that the Colonel may hear it, but I do think he is a little more portly than when we knew him. 
".. . I was in Philadelphia and saw Vince McNally, *27, and Clipper Smith. Since the time I saw him, Clipper has gone in to the Marine Corps and Vince has succeeded him. .. . I have been in Chicago and in my legal pursuits ran into Chet Wynne, who js doing very nicely, which was to be expected of a lawyer of his ability. He led mc to the room of Mr. Justice Kiley, whose accomplishments are well known."

From Paul Castner: 
Nothing new this time but these few "histori­cal" items may be of interest: 
I have on a number of occasions spent some pleasant time with Frank Wallace, who up until a year ago lived in the East but who now is in California working on movie scripts. 
Red Shea a couple of years ago pulled out of Dayton. O.. and spent some time in New York City—his first visit to the big city. He also came up to New Canaan to visit the Castners. Inci­dentally, he is Godfather of our youngest boy, Peter. 
I saw Harr>* Flannery right after he came back from Berlin. I had listened to his broad­casts. FVobably many other '23 men had also listened. Last report I had from Charles Martin was that he is in Detroit practicing law. Francis Disney is still in Albany to the b ^ of my knowl­edge. 
John Fogarty, after spending a number of years in South America, is back in the States, but I don't know just where he is. I do know he is married and has a couple of children. 
Gas Desda is with Union Carbide and Carbon, and John Montagne advised me some time ago that Gns has built a very beautiful home in Elmhurst—a suburb of Chicaga Of all things. Gus and I ran into each other in the Yale Club in New York City a year or so ago. 
I presume Francis Neitzel is still the big fi­nance man of Boise. Idaho. Dr. Chick Ooran, I believe, is in Akron, O., w^here he is a very suc­cessful child specialist. 
Comie Pfeiffer is in Louisville, Ky'.. in the general insurance business. I believe Tom Lee and Perc Wilcox by this time are running the Minneapolis Genera] Electric Company, and Linos GIotibadK unquestionably is the moving force in New Ulm, Minn. I would like to have some mem­bers of the class loosen up with some current information. I promise that it will be promptly forwarded to Bill Dooley. 
Attorney John Dempsey, Chicago, who was at Notre Dame in 1919-21, was unopposed in seeking the Republican nomination for states attorney of Cook County. John, a law partner of Ed Casey, '24, is chairman of the Republican county central committee and has for many years been active in Republican politics. He is the father of three daughters and a son.

 P. Hnrley, AFD. American Red 1925 John 
Cross, Camp Patrick Heniy, Vs. 

From John Hnrley: 
I was very busy the first of the year arranging my business affairs. The last part of January I joined the Red Cross as an assistant field direc­tor in the services to the armed forces. 
After training in Washington and Camp Lee. Va., I was transferred to my permanent assign­ment and my address is. John F. Hurley, AFD. American Red Cross, Camp Patrick Henry. Va. 
The work is very interesting particularly in this camp as we are in the Hampton Roads area and have a chance to be of service to the boys just before they cross the gang plank. Bishop 0*Hara*s chaplains, Father Siiea and Father Fellucci.'are doing a "bang up" job. 
We have a 4:30 p.m. Mass here every day, and all the Ix^s shipping out receive Holy Viaticum and every blessing Holy Mother Church can give them. They are prepared for anything and feel s^vell about it. The boys can go to the Sacraments day or night—^just like the days back at old Sorin. 
On the way to Washington I ran into Sgt. Roy Panli of Fontiac. He has been in the Army some time and looks fine. He tells me his pal. Don Aigner, is also in the Army. 
Last week while driving through Pittsburgh I called on Walter Haedaier. Butch is still with 
B. F. Goodrich. All's well with him and it was just like old times to talk with him. 
Heard about Vince Harrington's death only a week before it was announced in the last "Alum­nus." Panl Romwebcr told me about it. I've writ­ten Mrs. Harrington expressing' the sympathy of the class. 
What do you fellows think of the idea of se­lectins the first Sunday in June as a Universal Communion Sunday for our deceased classmates, Vince Harrinrton* Noble Kizcr, Bob Flynn, Rabey Fank, Blax Haaser, Ray Diver, George Kinsr, Oscar Lavery, Al Mathey. Bill Neville. Maurice Smith and John Weibel? I may have missed some. We could have Father John Lynch say a Mass for them.

Ross Amdt, successful football coach in Mish­awaka High School for these many years, was recently elected president of the St Joseph Val­ley Officials Association at a recent fish fry in nearby Plymouth. Huss has consistently produced one of the best high school teams in the northern Indiana area. 
John Bartley (still with Iteynold's & Co., 120 Broadway. N.Y.C. 5) reports that Dut Griffin has been a sg lieutenant in the Navy for some­thing over a year now. working in N.Y.C. but expecting an overseas assignment almost momen­tarily. Ihit and his wife and child reside in Woodside, L.I.

IFIctor F. Lcmmer, Box 661, Ironwood. MldL 
From Vic Lemmer: 
I received a very interesting letter from John J. Sweeney, Marwood Company. 221 N. LaSalle St., Chicago. 
I remember John Sweeney well, and of course. I recall Father Hennessey's English classes. Fa­ther Hennessey taught at St Mary's at the time, and he used to take our English papers over to St Mary's for correction. He said that we didn't even know how to spell, so at least once a week we had a spelling test. I hope, wherever he is. that he reads this, as I wish to convey my sin­cerest greetings. 
I hope that more men like Sweeney reply to the request of the secretary of the class of 1926 for letters. Please get in the mood to write, as we hope to make the column of our class in the "Alumnus" an interesting one-
Sweeney wrote: "In the last 'Alumnus' I no­ticed a comment of yours about mail being more or less welcomed by the good secretary of the class of '26. . . . 
"Quite possibly you do not remember me but if you will recall we were in a lot of classes together and one I remember most fondly was English I—Father Hennessey—over in the base­ment of Chemistry Hall away back in 1922. We were quite a gang and I can still see us as­sembling there at 3:15 each afternoon. Ihere were others too. but I believe those dear fresh­man days made an indelible mcrk on my memory. 
"In your notes you mentioned Art BidwiO. I haven't seen him lately, but I did have lundi one day with him about a year ago. I hear from J«e Shea occasionally—^hc is sales manager of the Statler in Detroit and doing very well. Jce and I had an apartment together here for about three and a half years, until he was transferred. I see Jimmy Glynn quite often, when he is in town from Lancaster, O.. where he is manager of pro­duction control of the Anchcr Hocking Glass Corp. Art Snder ot Toledo came forth with some news about six months ago: he has two fine chil­dren, boy and girl, and is still the best purveyor of flowers in Toledo (adv.), 
"About myself—I was in and out of the Navy, having leen discharged on the 38-year-oId ruling —and I now have the good fortune to be here with George Hartnett, who is vice-president of our company. George has done a grand job and hss a fine wife and son whom I see frequently. He v.-as down in New York City late last year and reported a very pleasant visit with JiM Wlie­lan and Mrs. Whelan. I would have enjtqred being there." 
Dr. Cieorse Dolmase at the latest report was assigned to the hospital *at the Nashville. Tenn., Army Air Center. But that was more than two months ago. Father Keith Roche, pastor of S t Ann's, Toluca, 111., sent on a generous financial contribution, but insists that there is no news 
— '26 or otherwise — in Toluca. "Our only claim to recognition." he writes, "is that the m^n line of the Santa Fe runs by the front door. But not until the day the Chief. Super Chief and El Capitan stop here will you know that anything is new in Toluca." 
Jim Dwyer as of March 1 is a partner in the legal firm of Satterlee & Warfield, Manhattan. He's been associated with the firm for many years. 
Chndc Gainon, with the Canadian Army in Italy, wrote again on Jan. 30. In part, he said: ". . . It mined cats and dogs Christmas eve and flooded us *sout of our foxholes. (I rescued my battledress pants three days later when the water went down) and we spent a wonderful night huddled together with a five-gallon jug of vino we dug out of a farm house to keep from freezing. Christmas morning we fell, slipped and skidded across the mud to a breakfast or porridge (hardtack, ground up. to which water and milk is added), a slice of bacon, a slice of bread and a spoonful of marmalade. 
"The Colonel brightened the day. however, by inviting the RHQ N.CO.'s into the officers' quar­ters for a coi pie of (pick-me-ups) which took the chill off". For dinner we had a slice of pork and some pudding. A gift of two chocolate bars and fifty cigarettes and a bottle of beer com­pleted our fesUvities. Our pals entertained with a few '88s in our yard, hut the air force sort of discouraged them with a pounding that gave us peace for two whole* days. .. . 
". . . Please give me the scores of last fall's football games. I hear we licked the pants off Michigan, but that'S only a vague rumor I picked up from the U.S. Air Force, and they did not know the score. .. . I was quite sorry to hear about Joe Sexton. . . . See my old roomie, J«e Dawes, is still sticking close to Kansas."

Joseph M. Boland, Station WSBT. Soath Bend, Ind. 
The class secretary (in ease you aren't within range of South Bend's WSBT) is hack on the home grounds after a stretch — since last August 
— with Chicago's WGN. Things looked rosy for Joe in Chicago — he was widely considered to be Chicago's best football broadcaster—but the local offer, plus the attractions of living in the South Bend-Notre Dame area, were too much for him, and so he's hack, for the third time since he was graduated. Joe and Peg and the children are living in Hishawaka. 
All of which leads vp to the expression of the hope that the good secretary will again become articulate, via typewriter, now that he's within striking distance of the Alumni Oflice. (Take that any way you want, Boland). 
Another alumnus vitally concerned with juve­nile delinquency (as is Judge Al Scott, '22, Los Angeles — see '22 news — this issue) is Al Doyle, of South Bend and Mishawaka. referee of the St. Joseph County juvenile court A fre­quent public speaker on current youth problems, and an excellent one, Al gave the first in a series of Sunday afternoon Lenten lectures sponsored in South Bend by the Catholic Action students of Notre Dame and S t Mary's. 
Writing of Doyle inevitably brings to mind one Grady — they married sisters — with whom the Managing Editor spent a very plersant hour in New York last fall on the day before the Army game. Les is in the publishing business, with the firm whidi puts out "Liberty," movie magazines, etc., has a large and exciting family on Long Island, and in general is much the same in looks and personality as the lad who ran the "Juggler" many a year ago. 
For genuine '27 news, see "Marriages." this issue. Steve (without his new wife) stopped on the campus briefly not long ago on his way back to Texas after a spot of special training in Penn­sylvania. Skipper Scanhm was one of the arrangers, and the best man, in connection with the Ronay nuptials in Gallup. N. Mex. 
Steve reports that Skipper — John P., for­mally — is assistant states attorney in Gallup and is the father of a young son described as "the finest boy bom in New Mexico." 
Red Smith, as you've noticed pcrhsps in the papers, has signed up as assistant coach of the New York Giants (football) after nine years in the same capacity with the Green Bay Packers. A recent clipping from the "Waukegan News-Sun."' (111.) of all places, tells that Capt Joe Reedy has been on 36 bombing missions out of England, according to his recent letter to Elmer Layden. 
An Air Medal with two Oak Leaf Clusters is the properly of SySgt. John Shilts from Houston, Texas, who is operating as a radio instructor with the Eighth AAF in Northern Ireland. A graduate of the AAF's Radio School in Madison. Wis., John was a radio instructor at Barksdale Field, La., until he felt a strong urge to be a gunner, and passed a special exam despite his age. In the European Theatre he was sent out on 15 missions before he was assigned again as a radio instructor. He wants to make it 25 mis­sions. 
Another '27 man in the AAF is Capt. Mike Daffecy, Indianapolis, who has recently been as­signed to the pilot school at Coartland, Ala., as assistant personnel officer. Mike had served in the same capacity at Maxwell Field. Ala., and at Nashville, Tenn., — with or without a piano.

From Loa Buckley: 
I see two '28 men qiute often who are fellow workers in the War Production Board. One is Bill Daffy, who is with the Automotive Division and the other. Dick Weppner of the chemicals materials branch of the Conservation Division-Dick has four children and Bill has three. Our old professor. Bill Leen, is also with the WFB, in the War Production Drive Division.

Our good dependable scribe, Bernle Garber, came through again this month with the follow­ing from Stanwood. Mt. Kisco, N. Y-: 
"I had a letter in January from TySgt. Rich­ard B. Parrish, Los Angeles. He was an opera­tions sergeant then, had fceen in service since 1941, and was looking forward to seeing wife and family just before going, he hoped, to Eng­land or Italy. If every American had Farrish's attitude, the war would soon te ours. 
"Saw John Kobinson at last Army game. As head of Selective Service in Connecticut, he is the only one of 48 such men who has Navy commission rather than Army. John is a lieu­tenant commander, if I remember rightly. In the subway fracas after the game, met Tom Byrne with Bill Dooley and had time to exchange good wishes. 
"Shared a table at the Army rally with Larry Calliney and John Antns and wives (one each). Bad Callagy joined us and entered his snapshots in children's pictures review; Les Grady stopped at table and took all honors. Ollie Scfaell. being needed at Great Lakes, wasn't with us, unfor­tunately. 
"John F. Mdhfahon, head of Air Hygiene Foundation at Mellon Institute, Pittsburgh, was in New York a few months aga In all appear­ances. John doesn't let Andy down. Mac re­minds me of a Republican senator. We had lunch —the time together was too short. 
"Loo Thornton, writing one of his rare but good letters from Brookland. D. C, says he ex­pects to be ordained in the C.S.G.'s next June That's good news. I was very glad to hear from Dave Gibson, at 1222 Cameta Drive, San Gabriel, Calif., and I wished he were nearer when I learned he is curing tax headaches at the Long Beach plant of Douglas Aircraft. Having sons 12 and 10, Dave was fortunate in getting his new home completed before restrictions. Having half an acre, the Gibsons can breathe freely. Imagine giving up Indiana for California! 
"Another '28er too rarely heard from and also in California, is Pat Varraveto. Pat is assistant superintendent, plant engineering, Vega Aircraft Corp., Burbank, Calif. He should tell us more than that. Georce Sdicner sends, from 1329^ Touhy Ave, Chicago, his famous *Ex News-Times' full of news and pix of N.D. and N.T. people. Ask him for a copy—it's good.

From Jim Collins: 
A very welcome surprise was a letter from Cpl. Frank Graham of Chicago who wTOte from New Guinea. His letter states in part: 
"Your letter finally caught up with me after these many months none the worse for wear and tear. I am in New Guinea; in fact I have been here for quite some time sweating out the heat and the food, which is like nothing you encounter in the states. My contact with my fellow alumni has been almost nil though I did see Bob Rohr­badi occasionally while in the states. The last I heard of him he was a lieutenant in the Navy, stationed around Sheboygan, Wis. He passed his CPA exams and was doing accounting for the the Navy. 
"I read that article about 0. D. Jones in 'News­week' which was mentioned in the August edition of the 'Alumnus.' Old Southern Fried went a long way in the Army, didn't he? I believe he joined soon after graduation. I still owe him a vote of thanks for that ambulance ride from school to the hospital when I was one of the many to have my appendix removed. I don't know whether this is news or not but I married Marge Garrity, a St Marj-'s gal, in 1939. Has anyone ever heard of Johnny Peroni? Heard that Donal­ty put on a lot of weight and was hit pretty hard when they rationed ^rdles." 
Bob Lee wrote that he had been commissioned a lieutenant (jg) in the Navy and was to report to the indoctrination school at Princeton Univer­sity on March 25. He also wrote: 
"And here is more news! None other than John Cecil Litdier is also a jg. ha^ang received his commission about two weeks ago. He is to re­port to Hollywood, Fla., on March 1. He was in town for a few days and was quite thrilled about nosing out his draft board. 
"And here's another jg from our class. I think you will remember Charley Docrr; he's in the claim department of the American Automobile Insurance Co. in Chicago. His commission came through about three weeks ago. and he is to report to Fort Schuyler, N. Y.t on March 1. 
"Paul OToole, who gave me a lot of help in getting started in the Navy, (and whose applica­cation for a commission was turned down) is being inducted on March 3. He will be the fifth from their family, including a sister who is an ensign in the Waves. [Brother Bob O'Toole, pres­ent N.D. student, reports that Fhurs application for a commission is being reconsidered by the Na\'y and that meanwhile he is marking time—in civies.—^Eds.3 
"Robb Purcell was in Chicago from Ottawa, 111., recently and says he is doing swell in his law practice. He .has been put in ^-F. Maury and I were down to Joliet recently and saw Don Wise, '33, who is a lieutenant in the Armed Guard, and was home on leave after spending a year in the Southwest Pacific" 
More news from the Chicago area comes from Stan Czpalski, who is catching up with his re­porting from the Army game. AMiile in New York with Neil Hurley they met Dick Roney, who was then waiting to be drafted, and Lf. Barry O'Ecefe. Jim Wardell joined them in his new uniform, ha\'ing just received a commission 
The Notre Dame Alumnus 
as a jg in the Navy. Neil has just been elected president of the Independent Pneumatic Tool Co. 
Stan said they welcomed Leo Sdiivone home for Christmas from his station in Idaho, where he had been stationed with Jim Downs. The wel­coming party included Hurley, -Ernie Hedihifer and Benny Salvaty. Stan left the Edgewater Beach Pharmacy about a year ago and is en­gaged in the drug business on the spacious Northwest side of Chicago now. His home address is 7104 N. Oriole Ave. 
I recently saw Lt. Frank Honeriump, *34, in the Officers Club with Lt. Cmdr. Chide Badcr, '19. The latter plans to move his family to Nor­folk this month. Frank told me that Pvt. Eli Abraham, *34, is stationed at Fort Sam Houston in Texas and has applied for duty in the Judge Advocate General's office. Lt. Tom Dalton* '34, has been organizing a crew for a new DE here and expects to go to sea soon. Frank is attached to the Naval Aviation Supply Depot here. 
Lt' Frank Gaol, '34. is in the welfare and rec­reation ofiice of the Naval Air station here. He said that a small reunion took place at the Offi­cers Club there recently when he and CUdE Bader were with Lt. Botts Crowley, Lt. Ted Twomey, Ensign Andy Pilney, Lt. <jr) Jdumy Druze and Lt. Dinty Shay. Twomey was oh his way to San Juan, and Pilney to Harvey Point, 
N. C. Dinty Shay was married in January to Miss Helen Slattery in Hartford, Conn. He is attached to the air station here, and they are living here. 
Frank also said that Lt. (jg) Ellie Caldwell, '35, is aboard an LST. Ensign Joe Pndcop, *41, has been ordered to the New Orleans area; Lt. (jg) Bill Bmno, '37. is stationed at the amphibi­ous base at Little Greek; and Lt. Wayne BCUner is attached to the amphibious force and was re­cently in this area.

An incipient career as a movie star was nipped in 1943 when Pvt. Eric Feldaiy (Alexander Kocsis at Notre Dame) was drafted and sent to Camp Hale, Ckilo., for training with the ski troops. He recently spent a furlough -with his sister. Mrs. Jose Caparo, South Bend, wife of the noted Notre Dame electrical engineering professor. Pvt. Feldary played the part of the messenger in the movie version of "For Whom the Bell Tolls" and finished work in a film called "Hostages" before he entered the Army- He had just been signed for a starring part opposite Joan Fontaine when the Uncle reached out for him. He is a native of Hungary.

Frank Cawley, budget officer of the War Pro­duction Board, Washington, D. C, is being given wide recognition for his substantial part in the 
accomplishments of the Board. Jerry Kluttz, writing in the "Washington Post," describes Frank as one of the five key men responsible for efficiency in the oi^ration of the A\TB and tells of numerous WPB savings within the past year: five million dollars in operating budget returned. . number of employees reduced, number of build­
ings used reduced, etc 
On March 31, Freddie Snitc* down in Miami Beach,-Fla., observed the eighth anniversary of his imprisonment in an iron lung. Since that day in 1936 when he was stricken by infantile paral­ysis in Peiping, China, he has learned to speak Chinese, to publish a paper sent regularly to more than 2.000 correspondents, to attend foot­ball games (especially in the Notre Dame stadi­um), which he can see by means of an ingeni­ous arrangement of mirrors, to read books, and to see movies. 
Fred was married on Aug. 10, 1939, and is the father of t\vo daughters. His spirit and de­termination — no other victim of infantile paral­ysis has lived for more than a year in an iron lung — have brought admiration and prayers throughout the world.

Itt Lt. Bill McConnick was in England, as of Feb. 28, enjoying the countryside and the bikes, "complete with hand brakes." Lt. Joe Vanghan reported in January that he was supervisor of ship­building for the Navy in Orange, Texas. 
Writing from the South Pacific to the class of '34, Lt. (jg) Frank Connelly tells a fascinating story of his year's experiences in service. Meet­ing thousands, Frank has so far caught up with only one other Notre Dame man, 1st Lt. "Pee Wee" Cntlip, '42, of the Marines. 
"From the home town of Rochester, N. Y.," Frank writes, "as fellow companions in the serv­ice from our class are CJerry Farrell in the cav­alry and Bemie Hennessy in the Navy. Bill Jones, '32, is in the Nai-y, as a full lieutenant by now, and my brother. Pete, *33, is a first lieutenant in the adjutant general's office. Marty Bayer, '35, is in the Coast Guard. John Gillooly, '35, is in the Army. , . . 
". . . I've been to New Caledonia. Guadalcanal, Hnnda, Hendova, Vella la Vella and others. My battalion hit the beach at Bougainville on the first day of the assault. 
"Probably my most interesting job since being in the ser\'ice was the trip to . . . where we invaded virgin forests far up in the mountains, in an area where few, if any, white men had ever been before. Here I set up and operated four portable saw mills, cutting heavy timbers for bridges in the combat zone. .. . I was the only officer present and, in my native hut, proj?­erly screened in and bug-proof — attended by a colored mess boy — I really enjoyed life. Enjoyed it, I say, outside of the several times we spent hours in fox holes, ducking the Nips. No one was hurt 
".. . to add to the general coloring of life . . . the birth of my daughter a couple of months ago .. . all will admit the tenth reunion is out . . . plan a big meeting in *49." 
One of the greatest Notre Daroc guys of them all left the campus in March to join the Ma­rines at Quantico as a second lieutenant. That, of course, was Ed **Moose" Kranse. coach of the basketball team — and a very successful one, considering the year and the material at hand — and line coach in football. 
Ed's wife and young son, Ed, Jr., are still in 

The Notre Dame Alumnus 27 
South Bsnd, pending arrangements after Ed completes his 11 weeks at Quantico. 
In writing a farewell to Ed, Jim Costin, sports editor of the South Bend "Tribune" commented: "One of the best liked men ever to appear on the athletic scene at Notre Dame bids farewell .. . in all my wanderings around the country as a sports writer I have never heard any gripes about him from any one. .. . I have never heard Ed utter a gripe about any of his old friends or acquaintances either. He's that land of a guy." 

Without question, one of the greatest all-around athletes in Notre Dame history and the recipient of many a trophy, Ed still values most the trophy which the student body spontaneously gave him when he was graduated. 
From Joe Glennon: 
Not much news this time. I would appreciate hearing from all of you. I realize many of you are busy in the armed forces (and our best to you) but even those might find a bit of time for an occasional note.

Franklyn C Ho<Areiter, 211S Treasure St, New Orleans 19, La. 

From Hoch: 
It seems that our appeal has borne some fruit —now if we can use the seeds for transplanting, maybe something will come of the *35 notes! Vince Gorman's wife and Glen Dubs* sister both came through with some dope for us. Tom Proc­tor had written us a letter in January, but we found ourselves scooped by our own editor when some of the Proctor stuff appeared in the last 
But let's be chronological— 

Around the middle of January we spent a few days in Alexandria, La. Our first evening we took a stroll and noted a huge sign in front of city hall. It was the Honor Roll of Alexandria men in the armed forces. We decided to look for *35ers — particularly Jacobs and GraveL There was Phil Jacobs and we had an answer to a dis­connected phone, having tried to reach Phil on a previous visit of several hours. 
Back in the hotel we found Cammille Gravel in the telephone directory. Two nights later Cammille and your reporter had a "jam ses­sion" in the bar of the Hotel Bentley. Cammille is practicing law in his native city, and from the appearance of man and ofiice, he is doing nicely, thank you. Cammille is married and is also a father- Imagine fellas—Gravel a father! He.car­ried the added responsibility with grace-
Cammille volunteered information on some of our crowd as follows: Albert David, ensign in the Navy; Phil Jacobs, lieutenant (jg) : Mitch Saleh, lieutenant (jg), "now in Florida; Fred Solari, lieutenant (jg), now in New Orleans; Eli Shahcen (Abraham) in Army, at Camp Clai­borne, Alexandria, La.; Vic Karaweff, lieutenant in Army, now in New York (Sty. 
When we were in Flacquemine, La., last De­cember we endeavored to contact Vic Kaizweff and found from the mayor that he was in the service. 
Cammille had asked about Tom Proctor. Upon our return home we found Tom's letter. His new work you know about, but here are a few bits of information about others of our gang. 
Ray Oakes—Ray was married on Jan. 8 to Eleanor Arnold. He is &n ensign and he and his wife are living in Philadelphia. Tom endeavored to reach Joe Argus in Indianapolis last fall, but found that Joe is a commissioned officer in the Navy and was last heard of "somewhere in Africa." 
Ben Beyrer—a Staff Sergeant in the Army, somewhere in Sicily. Maurice Qninn—a lieuten­ant in the Army and now supposed to be in England. 
Late in February we had a real surprise when a pink-bordered card brought us the following news: "Rosemary Joan Gorman, February 5, 1944. Dr. and Mrs. Vincent A. Gorman." This makes the third surprise from that Gorman man —first his marriage, then his service in the Navy, and now his fatherhood! The little man certainly went to town in a hurry, once he started making the news. 
Our appeal in the last issue of the "Alumnus" —the specific one to Mrs. Gorman—^brought re­sults. Vince's wife. Alberta, came through with a letter about Vince and several others. To you— much appreciation. Alberta. 
Alberta writes: "Vince was with one of the groups that first landed on Bougainville Island, and was in the Truk incident Fortunately he's been safe and has kept well." 
Joe Washko—in the Army and at Gamp Lee, Va. Fran Schlenter is in the South Pacific- Don't know what service. Mart Hendcls seems to be one of your reporter's colleagues—he is 4-F too. Ed Zimraer is expecting the "Greetings'* soon. 
Early this month came a note from Miss Luella Ehibs—we quote with appreciation: "We recently received a copy of the Notre Dame 'Alumnus* addressed to my brother Glenn. . . . 
"No doubt Glenn has not written you since he left the states, in September, 1943. He was sent to Greenland, and since, has been quite busy in that cold and lonely spot. However, the nurses and Red Cross have arrived up there, so they have some entertainment, beside the movies, now. 
"He specialized in automotives at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, and is now making use of this in the Ordnance Depot." 
And that's it for this time to press. Keep those letters rolling in and we may get back into our old stride one of these days. 

Heard of: Andy Mmffei, at Fort Eustts* Va.. where he had qualified as an expert gunner, and Ensign Don Love, at Fort Schuyler, N.Y.C. (in early February). 
Sgt. Walt Brown writes from the Pacific that the Seahawk game last fall had him on the edge of his seat. "It looks like 1 may be able to see some of the games next year.** he continues. "We have been over here about 22 months now . . . we go to Mass on Saturday because the priest has to say at least six Masses on Sunday. We are a little short on priests in this area, but it 
•will be remedied soon."

First. Dr. Ken Laws. Lafeyette. Ind.: ". . . we saw that you mentioned a *WiIIia« J. Bto-Craky* who has been in the medical Corps and has now returned to South Bend.

"I did hear from Mike Crowe, '38. He is a first lieutenant in the Quartermaster Corps and is at Camp Livingston, La. . . . has a fine son . . . his brother Emmett, '39, also has a son by this time." 
Many thanks. Ken, for that letter, and may we offer the heartiest, etc.? 
From Joe Knaler came a letter saying that he has been in Cblumbus, O., for the past four years, working as an engineer on the production front. Joe is the father of two boys, ages six and three. He had seen Lt. Gene Loansberry, who is sta­tioned ,jn the Westinghouse plant in Mansfield. O., as a naval inspector. Gene says Joe. is still a bachelor. 
I had a long and interesting letter from our faithful correspondent, Lan y PaJkoric. who, as a specialist in athletics, was helping to run wel­fare and recreation at a naval base on the At­lantic coast. Larry was particularly eager to have the baseball season start and was hoping to make the base team. He had his boot training at Sampson, N. Y., and his phy ed training at Bain­bridge, Md. At the former, Larry had run into Cket Smith, '35, and Jack O'Connor, '3S. both of the Navy. 
John Sbian dropped in, fresh from training at the Armed Guard School and happy as a lark at the prospect of sea duty. . . . Tom Praetor, "35, called the other day. He and I are going to have lunch together soon.

From Hal Williams: 
Top spot of the April notes goes to Bill Mc­Namara, of 5225 W. Van Buren St., Chicago, for this fine letter: 
"Almost six years have passed since I last said hello. Here's the dope: Finished law at N.D. in MO, had my own law firm in Chicago for about a year and a half until I went to work for the War Department. Now holding down an adminis­trative post with the Army War Bond Office. Am married and have one son, almost t%vo years old, his name is Patrick Joseph McNamara, born St. Patrick's Day, 1942. Poor kid has two strikes on him already as his mother's name was O'Rourke­
"Have a little news on the fellows whom I have seen recently: Ed Blann* l.aw '40, is a lieutenant in the Navy. Art Anderson, Law '40, is a lieu­tenant in the Army Air Force. Scott Reardon is still in Chicago. John Bnddey has four children, and doing fine in the business world. Mario Perioni, Law '40, is married, has his own home in Unncie, Ind., where he is practicing law and making quite a success of it. representing many of our big time insurance companies in the courts of his town. He also has a seeing-eye dog, which guides both him and his wife wherever they want to go. I have had the honor of having 

The Notre Dame Alumnus

Tom Hosty, '40, is a partner in the brokerage firm of Sincere and Company of Chicagt^ is mar­ried and awaiting an heir. . . . Walter McNaMara* '42, my brother, is married, a lieutenant in the Marines, and is now stationed in the far Fadfic. . . . Fenton Mee, Law '40, is a Marine officer stationed in England. I gathered this information from seeing his picture in the offidal Marine magazine. 'Leathernecks.'" Bill would like to hear from his classmates and says that if they are in Chicago to give him a ring "because my wife really knows how to cook." Better bolt the door. Bill, here comes the horde. 
Thanks, Bill, for the swell letter. Write again. 
And here's a dandy V-mail note from SgU Robert L. O'Brien, APO. N.Y.C. Writes Bob: "Received the October and December issues of the 'Alumnus' today and decided to kick throu^ with a letter. To cover my history since gradua­tion covers only a few sentences—^was in the in­surance business prior to induction, married hap­pily for three years, in the army two years, over­seas one and a half years of that; have been in Ireland. Scotland, England, invasion of North Africa, now Italy. I have seen enough action and am ready to come home any time, but don't expect to very soon. Have run into only one 
N.D. lad overseas— Curt Hester, class of '41 or '42. Would like to hear from some of the boys naturally, especially Eddie Kilrain, Bob Lancen Johnny Moir, and the rest. Am looking forward to that reunion which most of us missed. May God bring us all safely home! . . ." Thanks, Bob. for taking time out to ^\'ritc We really will have some reunion when the war's over and we all gather at N.D. 
And now a letter from the inimitable Hab Kirchman, of 1835 Manhattan Ave, Hermosa Beach, Calif. Writes Hub: "Frank Meyers has just lent me the latest 'Alumnus.* . . . Frank is chief weight engineer for Northrop Aircraft (I am a weight engineer for Douglas Aircraft—go­ing into my fourth year). Frank has youngsters and so have L . . .

Would like very much to get addresses of Ed Uniadie, Kj-le Donnell, John Kane» especially Chuck Daly's. He received my diploma for me at graduation and I think he still has it. . . ." 
Then there was the note from Lt. Eddie Mat-tingly of the Army Transportation Cbrps. Eddie says that he has been completely around the world since being commissioned (he wrote the letter from New York). He disliked India but fell in love with South America. He has no i)er­manent address, so if any of you fellows write to him, better address the letter to his home, Shriver Ave., Cumberland, Md-
The other day I had another nice letter from Father Anthony Gomez. He said that he at­tended the N.D.-N.Y.U. basketball game in the Garden in February and met Moose Kraaae, Scrapiron Yonng and Joe Hilbert. 
And that's about all the news except that Ensign Jade Zerfast, USNR, is in Georgia attend­ing a Navy communication school, and T«m Hutchinson, soon to be selected for service. stopped in around the middle of March for a visit while on his way to Washington.

Comes this beautiful clipping about one of your *38 classmates: 
**Capt. Bill Mehring of the Marines and his battery have been slugging their way from island to island in the Southwest Pacific. Having no chaplain, they've had to depend on a missionary as often as they've bumped into one of the vil­lages. A friend of ours tells this story of Bill: 
" 'No arrangement had been made with any local missionary to say Mass for Mehring's bat­tery. He therefore took it upon himself the day before Christmas to find a priest He traveled all day on foot through mud. water and jungle, but at each camp he just missed the priest At the lest camp, he left word for the priest to visit their battery if possible.' 
" 'The priest couldn't make it in time, but he did arrive late in the afternoon of the 26th. He heard as many confessions as he could and then gave general absolution to the rest Every Catho­lic Marine received Holy Communion. During the Mass, the battery knelt out in the open. Sweaty and dirty in their work clothes, the men were clean of heart and at peace inside—very glad of their chance to celebrate Christmas, even though late with Holy Mass and Communion.' "

From 2905 N. Charles, Baltimore. Lloyd Wor­ley, Lt. (jg) USNR, dropped a very pleasant note. He had attended Dick O'Melia's wedding in Florida and Dick attended his, while both were on duty at Jacksonville. Then Lloyd vrent to Har­vard, then to the Seabees at Norfolk, then back to culture at Harvard. Art Gartland was also there, in the Communications School. Ed Farrell was at Supply School also, as v.-as Sam Wheeler. 

This period is from July to December. 1943. so addresses probably are obsolete now. Inci­dentally. Georse O'Neill was also in attendance-At time of writing, Lloyd was in Baltimore waiting for his ship to be readied for sea duty and betting on which commission would come first, the ship's or the little blessed eventer. If Lloyd reads this before I see him in some out­landish spot, thanks for the nice words­
. Then a letter from Ray TiUe» stationed at St. Joseph Hospital in Louisville, under Dr. Irrin Abell. Laetare Medal winner during our time at N.D., as assistant resident in surgery and in line for the residency. Ray is a first lieutenant in the army medical corps and probably will see active duty about next year at this time. As to news of the class (seems like the M-D-s are monopo­lizing this column). George Bastian is at Nich­olas General Hospital at Louisville, coming from Gamp Barkeley. Texas. Says Ed Polank and Bar­roni were there, too. Ran into Lee Reed at the hospital, but no word as to Lee's doings or what­not. 
Last a note from Julie Kristan. 72 Lee Ave., Wallingford. Conn., that the second girl had arrived to keep the brother and other sister com­pany. This is known as keeping up with the Reardons. And. by the way. Tom Reardon is back in Brooklyn somewhere learning how to be a good ensign in the navy; by the time this reaches print, he won't t e there, however, so addresses are just a waste of time. 
That seems to be about all there is for this month, unless Bill Dooley has picked up a lot of information to tack on to the end of the col* umn in his usual pleasant manner. Personally, we're just hoping to be able to write this column next month from home, but are not too optimistic about that. Leavenworth, here we come!

Well, so was Capt. Jnlie Bercik. a Marine flyer. But he came out alive. 
Julie stopped at Notre Dame not long ago on his return trip from his home in St. Albans. 
N. Y., to the Pacific Coast, for reassignment-After six attacks of malaria, he had had a 90­day leave for hospitalization and treatment. 
Commissioned in January. 1942. Julie was in this country until August. 1942, when he went out to the Pacific- His first combat was on Jan­10, 1943. at Guadalcanal. He had three tours of six weeks each in the Solomons and a tour in New Georgia, where he was operations officer in charge of fighter direction. In bet^veen tours were rests in Sydney. Australia. He knew of or had worked under General Molcahy, '14. and Col. Tom Noon, '28­
Julie gained 25 pounds in 24 days while he was returning from the South Pacific- And at home he found 125 letters mailed to him, for­warded, etc, since October. 1942­
lat Lt. Ed Md>ermott; recently home on a fur­

Of the two tycoons of the *3S "Dome" (notes on whom strangely come up right together): Lt. <JE) Frank Repenhacen of the Coast Guard was (late February) in sub chaser work in Florida and very proud of his new son, Frank, the 4th, bom Feb. 15 in Buffalo; Ensisn Jim Raaf was (also in late February) being addressed through the FPO. San Francisco- Many of Frank's friends will remember his brother, Bernard, who came to Notre Dame several times while Frank was here. Bernard died last Sept. 28 from virus pneumonia.

In the Southwest Pacific for many months Lt. (jg) Dave Meslull, paymaster and supply officer aboard a destroyer, has seen extensive action in shore bombardments, successful night surface engagements and in heavy dive bombing and strafing attacks. 
Two '39 athletes have come up with splendid records, and splendid publicity well deserved, in far-separated parts of the country. At Carroll College. Helena. Mont., where he's been for five years, Ed Simonich's basketball Saints have won two official Montana Intercollegiate conference titles, and this year, with 10 wins and two losses, laid claim to the official collegiate and service cm\vn of Montana. Until Carroll had to give up football, for the duration, after the 1941 season, Ed's teams, averaging only 163 pounds, had won 13. lost four, and tied one. winning the conference's championships in *40 and *41. In track, his boys have won the con­ference title once. 
Earl Brown, as head coach of football and basketball at Dartmouth, is, in the nature of things journalistic, much more in the spotlight, and his remarkable achievements in both his sports have won national acclaim. But. from the class of '39. a salute! You've read, of course, that you'll be seeing much of Earl for the next two falls — in 1944 in Boston and in 1945 at Notre Dame — when D. and N-D- take on each other in football for the first time, "nme does march on!

Stationed at Jefferson Barracks, Mo., for some time; Oiubby was transferred east last fall. just in time for the first game of the World Series. He'had heard much of the Iowa Seahawk game broadcast, then was cot out hr a foreign station and heard no more of the game until he got back to the States. He vowed never to speak Spanish again. 
"Suppose you Icnow Trade Crane is wii«wiTTc in action," Frank finished. Seems funny to know something like that has happened to Truck, bat we've been praying, and maybe he'll get oat of this scrape. ... " 
Bemie Eikrs was commissioned a .second lieu­tenant in the AAF on Feb. S, at Columbus,- Hiss. Ditto John Danahae* a navigator, at Hondi^ Texas, in February. Jim Casper was at the AAF Pre-Tedinical School, Seymour Johnson Field.

It was our first get-together. since graduation and the first time either of us had seen an N.D. man for several months. Chick recently began his fourth year in the army." 
Writing in the Chicago "Daily Times" for March 9. FVank Smith, staff corre^randent In the South Pacific said: "I have met several Chicago area boys along the muddy roads from the beach­head- CapC James Danechaa, 24, formerly of the Chicago Towers when he worked for the Kemper Insurance Co., disclosed that be was a classmate at Notre Dame of Capt. Tam Bany* of Milwaukee, wounded in the fighting at Gloace3­ter. a few miles away. Like Barry. Donoghue was amazed when told another classmate of 1940, Jock Heacbry of Plainfield. HI., is now a lieutenant colonel in the air forces in this area. ­Donoghue's fiancee is Virginia Fullam, 4718 Ellis. Chicago." 
Milwaukee again! Lt. (jg) John Gavaa was home at Christmas from strenuous Pacific action and the "Milwaukee Journal" in its Christmas Eve edition carried a long interview with him. John and his Hellcat for five days had been over Tarawa during the invasion there, and he was stationed on the island for another five days once the invasion was completed. 
And John had seen lots of other action — Rabaul. where he got two Zeros, and Bougun­ville, for instance, and his was the carrier force that drove to within a short distance of Truk in a futile attempt to dare the Japs to come out and fight. His first action under fire was at Bou­gainville, and he has vivid memories of it. 
John is back now in the fighting zone. He has two brothers in the Army. 
Lt. <jg) Larry FetrosUaa, Waukegan, HI., was home in February for a reunion with his wife and his parents and. particularly, with his seveu-month-old son, Larry. Jr., whom he had never seen. Larry had had 14 months of doty in the Atlantic.

Most members of the class read in the Febru­ary "Alumnus" that John died on Jan. 4 and that he left his wife and his daughter, Anne, six months old, whom he had never seen. Mrs. Pow­ers and her daughter are in Port Lavaca, Texas. 
Mr. Patterson, doing a beautiful job as usual, has heard lately from Jim Meancy, Jack Joyce, Frank Behe and from Tom Grady's mother.

"Brother John W., '40, is li\-ing in a tent at some Pacific advance base, on his way to Tokio. .. . He recently saw Bob Blake, '40, in the Ma­rines. He writes to Hank Rago, Fh.D. *41. who is in England, in touch there with some of the liter­ary and philosophical figures of the day. 
"We recently got a letter, written on captured Jap stationery, from Fred Wolff, '40, who is in the direction of Alaska, expecting younger broth­er Jim, ex. '45, out there. John William had the Jap writing translated and I relayed it back to Fred, a 30,000-mile trip.

Erwin Moonej- is training in twin engine planes at Roanoke. KoeL Alac Carry is a sergeant at Reading. Russ Harris was awaiting the commissioning of a new ship; prob­ably by now is at sea. Ed Har\'ey is back in the country after 18 months away, enjoying leave while his ship is overhauled. 
"George Miles is in Ireland, he writes Noel-Anstin Sobczak, '40, was in Washington, receiv­ing training for duty abroad in French-speaking territory. Leo Factean, he writes, is somewhere in the South Pacific. 
"Bert Kelly has been at Banana River. Fla., receiving advanced bombing training, after finish­ing, somewhat after his older brother, Dan, here at Corpus Christi N.A.S. Marine Lt. Dan Dahill has been here at the base, but I haven't been able to contact him after one chance meeting.

Cavanaugh Hall, of the semesters in '37 and '38. our freshman year, will remember as a small, active Spanish refugee who lived next door to prefect Tom Neill. learned English (starting from scratch) in a matter of weeks, held endless dis­cussions on. the situation in Spain, endured all the freshman tricks, and got every one he knew to autograph his "Dome," — familiar autographs I went over with him at his home in Mexico City-He says: that his Spanish has improved, that he is no longer a Fascist but a republican; that he remembers all his friends. He has married a beautiful Spanish recent refugee, has a son, and says to tell all his friends he has settled down: our discussion heli>ed to convert him from Fascism. His address: Palma, 32-201. 
"Fred Wolff says Roger Young, '42, is with him. Bob Malone, '43, was in the Air Corps near­by, though Fred hadn't heard from him in a year. Joe Dubbs, '36, was at his former station in Alaska, and Holy Cross chaplain, Father Kmlecik* is on a nearby island, though Fred hasn't met him. I met Father (Astronomy) Kline, C.S.C., in Laredo on my way to Mexico City last summer-We talked of the observatory at St. Mary's." 
Frank Bche, studying Japanese at the Univer­sity of Chicago, wrote to Mr. Paterson: "I had lunch not long ago with Joe Lawler, who is a research. engineer for duPont. He was bubbling over with enthusiasm over his recent plunge into the sea of matrimony. Bob Schnltz of South Bend is connected with an accounting firm here. Met him one night in a night club, of all places. 
". . . Lt. John Boyle is about to become a proud papa — it may have already happened. Tom Reis is an ensign on duty in the Pacific for the past several months, while. Jack, his brother of the '42 class, is on duty in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. He. too, wears the gold stripe. Bob Ronstadt was a Marine instructor the last I heard from him. At the time he was sweating out a call to OCS at Quantico. It certainly -was a shock to hear of Bob- Smith's death in the South Pacific." 
Jack Joyce, with the Starterc Mills, Tucapau, 
S. C, (and a very unwilling 4-F he is) wrote to Mr. Patterson about his letters from Joe Barr, '42, Vinnie Sposata and Al Vandervoort. Joe, as a second lieuten3nt in the Marines, was in the Tarawa onslaught, and about it he wrote to Jack: "Tarawa was pretty bad. While, there I managed to collect a few bits of shrapnel in my face and arms — all gone now — and a bullet through my shoulder. All's well except that even" now I can't throw a baseball 15 feet, but worst of all I lost my best buddy in the Corps." 
Jack. like so many others from Notre Dame. was thrilled to see Joe in the Paramount News movie shorts of the Tarawa invasion. Helmetless, Joe was standing erect in his landing craft, just preparatory to shoving off from the cruiser or destroyer for the island, and he was reverently leading his men in prayer. 
In the hospital for a time. Joe is now back on duty in the F!acific. He had seen Capt. Frederick "Bud" Fowler. For his heroism at Tarawa Joe was awarded the Na\'y Cross, which was present­ed to him personally by Admiral Nimitz. (See picture and citation elsewhere in this issue.) 
Pvt. Sposato is outside the U.SJL and writes t>'pical Sposato letters to Joyce. Vinnie hears occasionally from Capt. Dave Powers of the Ma­rines. CpL Vander^'oort is in the South Pacific and in his own words, is ^'crazy about tennis," which mystifies Joyce no end. 
Jack, stowed av.-ay in South Carolina, hadn't actually seen any *41 men in a long spell but until recently he had been in touch with John Lynch, Charlie Kegler and Jack Woelfle, of later classes, who were at Camp Croft, S. C, 12 miles away. 
Mrs. Grady said that Tom, a lieutenant jg, was in transport duty in the war zone. He's been in foreign duty since March. 1943. 
At the suggestion of the Alumni Ofiicet Mr. Patterson wrote for news to six members of the class, but only two of the six, Joyce and Behe, came through in time for this issue. Come, come boys! Just think how much you enjoy reading the other guy's news!

Alike Scanlon and CpL Larry O'Connor, '39, occupied in February —maybe still do — a three-man tent at the AAF Service Command Station in England.- Frank is a traveling reporter, working with the AAF Pub­lic Relations Department throughout England. Mike and Iiarry are a traveling classification team, moving to various camps in the European theater in AAF personnel work. 
Lt. John McDonnell is APO 634, N.Y.C. Jim Lang, with the FBI, was married, on June 29, 1943, to Ann Steinle, also of Delphos, O. Ensign Joe Callahan, married of late to F^t Ross, was at the last report at the NAS, Jacksonville, Fla., but that was a couple of months ago. Larry Bracken is a major in the cavnlr>-. 
1st Marine Paratrooper Lt. Charlie Gerard of Mishawaka. in the Marines for two years, was home on leave in Februarj-, and he had many a tale to tell of his participation in the first raid on Bougainville and of his other experiences. Tlie principal speaker at several gatherings in Mish­awaka and South Bend, Charlie did a masterful story-telling job. The Alumni Office was pleased to greet him for an hour. In early April, Char­He's engagement to Ruth Schindler of Mishawaka was announced; 
Word comes from Hubert Schlafly, of the trans­mitter engineering division of GE, who was on special assignment at the radiation lab of MJ.T. He was seeing frequently Dr. George Collins, Dr. Ed Coomes, Ralph Gaston and Joe Phelmcier (two former N.D. graduate students) v.-ho were also at H.I.T. on special work. 

A page feature in the Chicago "Herald-American" of Feb. 13 .told of Don Krmlovec's in­spirational trust in Mother Cabrini as he spent 16 terrifying days on a life raft in the Atlantic, the victim of a torpedo. Don was bom in 1919 in Chicago's Columbus Hospital, founded by Mother Cabrini, who died in 1917 and who was beatified in 193S as a step toward sainthood. One of his first acts upon reaching Chicago, on Jan. 30, 1943. just after his rescue, was to go to this hospital for a prayer of thanksgiving.

1942 PTt. 
From Scoop Scanlan: 

The press ser\'ices of the country are doing a splendid job of helping keep track of the class of '42. Lt. (jgr) Paul Lillis has been shown in action aboard a PT boat which he is currently skipper of somewhere in New Guinea waters. Bcrnie Crimmins also has a similar assignment in the South Pacific war theater. Via Arch Ward and the "Chicago Tribune," comes this note: "Lt. James Curric, former Wildcat star now serving on a PC boat in the Atlantic, recently wrote Northwestern friends: 'I ran into GeorEe Sobek, old Notre Dame basketball player, out here and did I rib him about those two victor­ies.* " Ward earlier pointed out that some time back Roger CumminRS, '42, played in a naval officers basketball team in Hawaii. 
Lt. Walt Hagen, Jr.* and his wife won a waltz championship at the Officers club at the Hotel Knickerbocker in Chicago while Hagen was fur­loughing recently. 
This from Joe Bergan: "I am a junior at Loy­ola Medical school in Chicago. Felix Lownik and Ed Glaser from our class are also here—all part of the Army ASTP program." 
From another part of the world comes a cor­rection. It seems that two issues back we com­mented on the fact that Mildred Jaeger, a WAC at Fort Sheridan, has a husband who is serving in England. Mr. Jaeger is a member of John W. Bercen's ordnance outfit now in England. Some­where along the line, the marriageable status of WAC Mildred Jaeger became associated with John Bergen, all because an' apostrophe and an "s" got lost. Anyhow, let John tell about it— with interesting comments: 
"Needless to say, you better get the informa­that follows in print and how: ? 
"I am not the husband of Sgt. Mildred Jaeger of the U.S. WAC corps but I am engaged to Miss Evelynn M. Zink of the class of '42, S t Mary's college. Sgt Jaeger is married to a staff sergeant who is an automotive man in my out­fit. (John is the foist sgt.) To say the least, Sgt. Jaeger is up in the air but if you have ever felt the sting of a first sgt., it would be to your bene­fit to stay right in Fort Sheridan." 
Bergen, whom we hcpa is properly defined as engaged to a St. Mary's belle, and they have our apologies, V-mai!ed this as well: 
"I have been over in England for several months. We are in the ordnance but are being swallowed up by the Air Force. On my way back to California after my furlough I did get a chance to visit Notre Dame. It certainly was good to see the place again. In all my travels I have yet to run into any of the boys in my class. I did see Bill Meier while I was at school in South Dakota. Since then I have seen Amer­ica and a part of England and Scotland and still no boys from '42. Perhaps their presence in the Navy in big numbers accounts for that. 
"My roommates, Joe Diamond and Phil Lacier, are-both brass-hats, Joe a lieutenant stationed in Deming, N. M., and Phil a lieutenant (jg) in the South Pacific He, by the way, was recently cited for bravery and cool-headedness under fire by his company in the Kula Gulf fracas." 
From Fort Monmouth. N. J., came a letter from Russ Jandoli, who edits the "Daily War. News" summaries there. His daily analysis of the world news situation has been praised by GIs and officers alike, and on top of that Hanson Baldwin of the "New York Times" has com­mented very favorably. 
Cpl. Thomas Powers, still at Camp Patrick Henry, Va., adds his editorial chatter: 
"My younger brother, Johnny, has been doing my share of operating around the N.Y.-Wash­ington circuit and he has come up with news of familiar '42ers. He met Art Rhodes, ex. '41, in the Post Exchange at Fort Meade, Md. Art is a first lieutenant and was there as a replace­ment officer. He and I share many swell memo­ries of the faded glory of old Freshmen Hall. along with Clyde Mees, Don Wharton, and L«us Schirm III. Last time I heard from Looie, he was captain in the transportation corps and ship­ping out. 

"Johnny met Frank Lavelle in the Commodore on the eve of the N.D.-N.Y.U. basketball game. They both ran into Dan Broderick <Loa Appone and Bill Hartman's buddy from St. Ed's hall). I remember seeing Brod in front of Sorin in 1941 graduation. He was a second-class seaman at Great Lakes then. He's a lieutenant (jg) now. He spent the last eight months in Murmansk. Johnny had good seats at the game Valentine's Night with Marty Fitzpatrick, Chnck Coniff and Bemie Marbach, who are stationed at Columbia University's medical ASTP. 
"The 'New York Daily News' scooped the rest of the N.Y. papers again. They had a stunnins shot in their picture section of Paul Tafel and his wife coming down St. Patrick's Cathedral steps after their wedding Feb. 12. Understand Tom Walker and Byron Kanaley were there for the occasion. 
"I'm still pacing Italian PW's here, mamoriz­ing Patrick Henry's 'Liberty or death' speech." 
Another member of our class has been killed in action—Lt. Robert G. Smith. The Navy de­partment on March 4 notified his parents in Joliet. III., that he was killed in action in the FVicific He was killed during an aerial battle in the Southwest Pacific. He is the first major mon­ogr.im award winner to be killed during World War II. [Major Vince Harrington, '25, mono­gram guard on the Four Horseman squad, eariier died of a heart attack in England—^Eds.] 
Here is the latest chatter on the lawyers of our err., contributed again by Mrs. Lora Lash-brook : 
"Reporting on the '42 lawyers which is usually a bright spot in a day's work, this time is not a happy task. The reason is that the first report of one of the boys as 'Missing in action' has reached us during the first week in March. Paal Kashmer of La Porte, Ind., an ensign in the Navy on duty in the Mediterranean area, is missing as of Feb. 
20. In a recent letter Paul wrote: *. . . Upon my last visit to Notre Dame I was' very much im­pressed by seeing our Alma Mater the way it has been seen by the many people who have written me about it. It was then for the first tims I felt that inner calm and peacefulness about the campus . • . even though the school itself is being washed into the wake of war ac­tivity. There is consolation in the thought that though a beautiful thing like that must be marred along with other things in time of war, it cannot be totally destroyed, and it will rise up again in fall strength. Iliis may soond a great deal like Fatiber 0*Dnuwirs oratory Intt I'm beginning to think that many of the things he has said were something more than just beait­tiful oratory. I would like to know how tfainss are with all of yon there at school.' I kncrw those of Panl's friends who know about tfaia will want to add their prayers to ours for the good news that this report may not be true. 
**CmpU Jahn Verdonk is overseas on a confi­dential mission for the Army. Whatever it is, we know John will perform it perfectly. Emifiis Jolm Baty and James HeVay are on active duty in the Pacific but we have no permanent ad­dresses. Charies Jensen is instructing Army fliers at an Army base in Wisconsin and he tells ns this work is being discontinued in June and that he may be back in school at that time. Ensixa Jerry Killicrew is with the fleet .. . we know not where. 
"EniiKn Joe Lane at last reports is in the At­lantic and was in or near London. Jee Lavcry is in England with the Army, according to a note recently received from his wife in Denver, Ray Qainn became Lt. Quinn of the Army Air corps on March IS. Among other things, he has learned to get around with nothing to guide him but the stars, but the general opinion here is that he knew his way around—stars or no stars. 
"Lt, Boh Sinon, USHC, is sUll at New River, 

N. C. training Marines. Hiis is the station where the women Marines are trained. Bin Spanglcr has been moved to Barksdale Held, La., where he is becoming a member of the Mili­tary Police. His wife. Jean, was planning to join him there. Ensign Fred Hoerer of the Supply Corps is now on active duty with the Navy, having completed his training at Harvard a few weeks ago. Hike Stcpovidi is now Seaman Stepo­vich on duty at Great Lakes. His address is Building 95. Great Lakes. 111. 
"Lt. Jae Barr, USMC, is back on duty with the Marines in the South Pacific. At least a half dozen of the boys from various spots in the U-S-A. have written us to urge us to see a film of the Tarawa battle in which they have all seen Joe in the group at Moss. Apparently he has re­covered from his injury received in the Battle of Tarawa. Lt. Charles Basson completed his train-* ing at Yale, and is now on active duty. Ensign Cecil Jordan visited Notre Dame recently. He is still stationed at Norfolk but was to be trans­ferred. 
**Lt. Bob SoUivan, who has teen on duty in various places training Army fliers, wrote us from Fort Wayne where he was at the airfield for a few minutes late in February. He was headed for overseas duty then. Lt. Alex Tsiolis is still in Italy and still doing a good job of his part of the occupational government. Charles Hnrray, now of South Bend, was married re­cently. He is working at Studebaker's. 
"Lt. Tim Maher wrote during the first week of March from his western station and we're ex­pecting a new address for the files soon. Lt. JadE Finnigan, USMC, is also on duty with the Marines in the Pacific area. Gerald Kamm writes us from England. He is putting his leisure time to good nse by visiting English conrts. He finds the British courts interesting and feels this is good supplementary education for a lawyer. 
"Nidc Villarosa keeps us informed of his whereabouts. He is right now at Fort Benning, Ga., and thinks it unlikely that he will get a chance at OCS. He expects to fight this war as an infantryman along with several others who were a little late for the officer allotments. Among them are Franda Brinkman^ Dkk Brrdges. AQen Fink, Barry Gathrie, Gnham He­Gowan* Bofc HUford, Dick Leon, Don Patrick, Jim Price, Jade Ryan, John Buczkowsk! and Tim Green. 
"Walt Jones is at Duquesne U., PittsburRh, and was slated to get a commission soon. A week ago we lost five of the lawyers to the Navy—• they all were commissioned ensigns by the NR­OTC at Notre Dame. They were Bill Lawless, Jade Lawler, H. J. Smith, Don Hammer and 
J. J. Kelly/' 
Remember Ray Donovan, late of the N.D. pub­licity department? Jim Armstrcn? relays a com­munique that Ray is currently the sports editor of the Logansport. Ind., "Pharos-Tribune." 
From Kelly Field, Texas, comes this report 

from Lt. Bill Morrow: 
"Again after galavanting around the country for the past year, I am writing. Although I am at Kelly Field now, I spent most of the last year in Albuqueraue, N. M., at a base there* "While living there a shining new officer moved in next door to me in the BOQ and he turned out to be none other than Bill Hosinski, the long drink of water from N-D. We were together quite a while and naturally had some good old fashioned reminiscing parties. I'm sorry to hear about Jim Hackner and C3- Miller. 
"I heard from Coe McKenna and he is on At­lantic duty as lieutenant (jg). . . . Hosinski got himself engaged to a very nice bit of feminine pulchritude while in Albuquerque. Her name is Martha Mitten and she hails from Winthrop, Mass. They are to t e married shortly after Eas­ter. This should come as a great surprise to the boys who knew ol* Will. Incidentally, she out­ranks him. She is nn ensign in the WAVES— and her commission predates his." 
After some time, I've gotten word twice from the No. 1 promoter of our class, Lt. James Pat­rick O'Laoehlin, with the Marines in the South Pacific 
On Feb. 25, Jim wrote: "I can't give you any news. Bill. We've been very busy, but everything is fine. I'm in good health and am eating well. Guess I've been pretty lucky a couple of times, but what Irishman hasn't? Haven't heard from any of the boys in a good while—in fact not so much mail has come in recently. Censorship is still very strict." 
From Norman. Okla., and the Naval Air Sta­tion there, comes a letter from Ensign John Gavin : 
"Just finished a letter to Steve Graliker, ad­dressed to Cbrpus Christi. The 'Alumnus' has been following me around and I've some ad­dresses that others may like to know about. 
"The outpost of Norman, Okla., is the haven of 1st Lt. Joe Shields, USMCR, who, like my­self, is a primary instructor for the Navy. Joe has been here since August and I arrived on May 1 a year ago. Joe Gillespie. MI, is also a first lieutenant in the Marines and is instructing at Hutchinson. Kans. Tom Foley, ex. *42, is sta­tioned at Abilene, Texas, a lieutenant in an ar­mored unit. My wife (Jean Devine from S t Mary-of-the-Woods), and I spent our leave with Tom in Dallas the first of December. For a week­end, we had a real reunion when Frank (Red) GiUis* ex. '42, joined us from his duty as ath­letic instructor at the Army Air Base at Alters. Okla. F^nk was then a staff sergeant but may be higher now. 
SjSgL Jade Gordon is at Camp Maxey, Texas, near the Oklahoma line. So far we haven't seen Jack but GilUs spent Christmas with us in Okla­homa City." 
Ftom another part of the world, Sgt. Bob CMeaan airmailed (on Feb. 8) a report from North Africa: 
"Today's mail call brought me the December 'Alumnus*; and, after having gradually lost con­tact with most all my close friends, it was about the most welcome thing that could have come along. I believe I read every word of it. . . * 
"I've been overseas over seven months now and have spent just about all my time rolling my pack, heaving my barracks bags around, dashing for 2^-ton trucks, hurrying up gang planks. We have traveled far, seeing a great deal. .. . I ran into Charlie Gehres last August- He's with a fi­nance outfit and was stationed here for a good many months but he left a short while ago and is now in a censored to\vn in Italy. Larry Av­brey. also in finance, is still here. He and Charlie were in the same outfit in the states, went to England and Africa together and were split up over here. Charlie is a technician, fourth grade, and Larry is a technician, third grade.' 
"I see Larry about once a week and we man­age to gag down a few vinos together. Saw that Dan Hilgartner is oyer here, in the same area. Called him this evening after reading the 'Alum­nus.' only to find him out with some nurse. . . . 
". . . Recently I read in 'Stars and Stripes' that Bob Saggan was decorated for fine work in the Pacific . . . This business of the 'sidewalk alumni' that Father Brennan and Elmer Layden used to speak of—^well, it's no baloney. During football season Notre Dame rated the only blows in the 'Stars and Stripes.' Every soldier knows of Our Lady's Boys." 
One of those Sorin boys, Joe Palmer, now a pharmacist's mate 3/c with the USNB. V-mailed a note in conjunction with Lt. Mike Hinrs. now a first lieutenant USMC: 
"Had a big reunion 'somewhere in Ireland* and it sure was swell. Am waiting anxiously for the next 'Alumnus* and all the news in it." 
On the week-end of March 19, George Uhl. the chemical engineer who has been running one of the Beilly company plants in Indianapolis, checked in for a week-end at Chicago- We had a grand get-together and George, by now, should be wearing the Navy blue He was ticketed for ensign's commission and vrzs to report to New York as a DVP. He has encountered such men as Frank Fox. Mike Carr. Bill Tcbin, and sev­eral others in his journeys. Bob Gsiger. his home­town pal, is off to the wars, and Tommy Schmidt, George says, is now happily married and lives in Mishawaka. 
S/Sgt. Tommy Mills. Jr.. back from several months overseas in Sicily, Italy and North Af­rica, came through Fort Sheridan on the rota­tional program and was in to say hello. Too bad that a week after he arrived here his dad. Tom­my, popular generalissimo of the Rockne Me­morial, died suddenly. 
Tommy met Tony Maloney. Paul Kashmer, who since has been reported missing in action, and Gcorce Sdireibcr over there. He attended mid­night Mass on Christmas "somewhere in Italy," and who should be the celebrant but Father

"I now have a speaking acquaintance with the Bishop of this diocese and he asked me to drop in for a ^ot of tea sometime. He spoke as tho' he holds con­stant open house.

IF ITS NEWS. "WRITE SCOOP! 

Lt^ Vince Daif^Icr has been cited by the Army for saving four members of his company from a Jap grenade while taking the brunt of the ex­plosion himself. Happily, he was not seriously in­jured. Naval A/C Gerry Orcsz is at Olathe, Knns., having been graduated from the prc-flight school, St. Mary's, Calif. Lt. (jg) Tom Teamey cycloned into the Alumni Office on March 23, on his way to New London, Conn. 
i>t< (jg) Roy E. Murray is in the Pacific. En­sign Bob Raaf ditto, and Pf c Olen Parks like­wise- John Griffin was a storekeeper, first class in the Coast Guard when he wrote in late Janu­ary from Seattle, Wash., but was expecting sea duty momentarily. Lt. Tom Cody was APO 851, Miami, Fla.. in early February. 
Mrs.' Reynolds, mother of Bill, had talked in Asheville, N. C, with Jack Dinges, who was then at nearby Camp Croft. Mrs. Reynolds said that Don Grant was in the Pacific. In the same pond: Ensign Bcrnie Crimmins, commander of a PT boat, who wrote to Scrap Young when Bernie was on a two-week leave in Sydney, Australia. Bernie hadn't seen Ensign Bob Margrave in some time, although they had been only a mile apart on Christmas Day and hadn't known it- Lt. Ed Koch, USMC, was home on leave in Fort Wayne. Ind., before going on to San Francisco for fur­ther duty. Ed's brother. Cpl. Lester R. Hoch, ex. '35, was killed in action in Italy on Dec. 14. 
1943 Ensign Edward C. Roney, 1723 Iroqouis Ave., Detroit, Mich. 
Robert Lonergan, Sports Department, The Chicago Tribune, ChicagP, HI-

From Ed Roney (received just too late for Febru­ary issue): 
This PC duty is fine—if you don't get seasick. And I'm afraid I have to plead guilty. The worse part about it was that I had to stand by and watch the other officers gobble up turkey, dress­ing, mince pie, etc., on Christmas day without a bite. 
Jim Girard is on another PC down here but I haven't seen him since he went aboard as he's in another task group making the same run. By this time he should have his hair clipped pretty short as these crews do a job when they initiate an officer crossing the line. 
Hie mail stack isn't too heavy this month but brought a few surprises. The first is from Marine Lt. Ed McKim. He writes: "I have been in this outfit ready to go for some time and today we ^ t our orders for 'permanent duty beyond the seas.' Nice way to word it, hey? While at Quan­tico and Parris Island the first six or seven months I saw Bob Morriri and Bill Scully around once in awhile. I understand Scully drew Mft duty and, for Blair McGowan's interest, Morzill is in the 33rd Replacement Bn. T.C, New River. 
N. C. 
"Larry Sullivan, Bob Sinor, Walt BCcNaHsra, Kevin O'Toole and myself were all in the same class there. Larry and Bob went to New River. The last I heard of Larry, he was in command of a platoon of women Marines. Kevin and Walt came out here with me and were sent to combat engineers at Camp Flendleton. Bill Hyde, *39, and Bill Kclleher, '42, are also in the same outfit with me. 
"As you no doubt know, while on a leave in July. -I took myself a wife and brought her out with me. In spite of San Kego, we found a house and had O'Toole down several weekends. You'd be surprised at the capacity of the guy. 
"When I first got here X ran into Frank Metx­ger, '42, who was aboard the USS , a 'can' in and about the bay. Haven't seen him since then. Ran into Lcnnon Kelly, ex. '43, an Army staff sergeant just back from Canada. 
"I ran into a chap named Wolfe here, class of '44. A Pfc- in the Marines and a Jap language student. Guess he's already shipped over. 
"Have, been doing regular infantry duty since 18 July. What a footsore! Last week I was sent out to refere3 maneuvers. Had a swell time riding all over in a jeep with field glasses, tailing peo­ple that they were dead." 
Thanks a lot, Ed. 

Now let's switch to the South Pacific itself. From Lee Raymond who's seen a lot of action comes this: "A recent edition of the 'Alumnus* re­cently reached me on one of the more teautiful of the South Pacific islands. I gather that no one knows my whereabouts. Jim Cahill and I ere still together on an islar.d that must for the present be unnamed. We have been to Guadalcanal and Munda and we might add that we were only a mile away from that 'Ripley* meeting that took place in New Caledonia. I ran into Bob Sweeney on the high seas. Ted Burke is. I believe, in New Zealand by now. 
"I have heard that most of the fellows . are fighting on the other side of the world. Bill Fnre has written me but I misplaced his address. He's at the University of Wisconsin. 
"I wonder if you know that Dick GuUinE was married on July 31. The news was very late in reaching me." Looks like "Bulldog** will have some real stories ready for our reunion. By the way, Lee, your father wrote the same day to tell me where you are. He was afraid you might not have time. Tbanks to both of you-
One of those men "on the other side of the world" is Stan Pyritz. For the benefit of those heading for Italy, here's what to expect: "Ours was the first finance unit to hit Italian soil as we were attached to the first invasion force. For the past three months now I've been living like an animal. We are really roughing it and have been all along. Since hitting this God-forsaken hole we've been living in small pup-tents, work­ing in tents, and eating out of mess kits out in the open air, rain, snovr, or shine. We've been having rain for the last three weeks now every day, so everything is muddy and wet. Eatinff in the rain isn't too bad except we get mad when it splashes apple butter all over us. 
"I slushed down to my pup-tent last night to find it completely surrounded by water. After doing some fast and furious ditching I could get in. but it's no use even trying to keep the place drj-. 
"The artillery raises the devil every night-They are on the side of a mountain just A few miles away, ao we can aee the flashes all nii ^ lonff. A few weeks ago we were hieky enoo^ to see a dogfii^t between a Jerry and one of our Mostangs. * . 
"I got my sergeants stripes about a noatli ago. I was pretty lucky but I'd rather have a quick victory." What a stozyl Thanks, Stan. Come again. 
A guy that may take the same boat as McKim is Dm BUfer. Frcnn Don: "It was so good to know the whereabouts of our classmates £raiB your column. I decided I had better let yoa know where the president and I have been hiding oat. and a couple of others. 
**Jack TaUctt is in pre>fli^t AAF in Monroe. I^a.; Bob Breaks and Beb Danla at Port Jnenen^ Calif. ;Jim 0*D«aaen jnst shipped towards the European theater; and I myself am on the way to the South Pacific." 
A guy that may eventually get to sea is J. J, Becker. He's had three ships assigned now at erne time or other. From anti-sub officer J. J. comes: "I,ast Saturday listened to the game and the lads really had a tough time against the Sea-hawks but they came through. Was down to the dog track the other night and won 43 dollars playing the pups. Not too bad for an amateur like myself. Since you left, my ship has been changed'again. I hoi>e for the last time." 
A letter a month later from him brings this: "After being in Miami for six months, 'finally got five-day leave on the way to my ship. Knky Walfh was still on the Beach when I left. He was headed for CCS soon. BUI Jahnaea had been assigned to a PC. 
"At the time of this writing. Pm confined in the Navy hospital at Norfolk with scariet fever. Three weeks more and then a month's ndc leave. I'll probably miss the boat now. 

"Christmas Eve I met Tem Finacaae here in Norfolk. He's on a PC and seems to like it very mudi. We had a fine time celebrating Chzistmas together while on an overnight stay in Washing­ton. Ran into BiD IlalKr who is now a private in the Army stationed there. Also got a letter from my ex-robmmate. Jade *Do^ Hidey. He is sta­tioned at Fort Bliss, Texas, in the desert, eating sand and dust." 
Another letter from Pete Merita gives us news of the Navy in the European theater. He, Laais Kartz, Tern CMMy, Jim GaUagker, and Gad Fitck have been moved to a much better place. A great deal better for him especially, for he was able, by a stroke of luck, to spend Christmas with his brother in the Army. Goes on as Plete would, aboot the team and its record. Beard one of the games out at sea and went wild with the . 
. drum yell and the Victory March. Says he can't say much now. but will have plenty to talk about at our first reunion. A dam good letter. We'll hear from him again. 
Another letter from Tom Cmamey, one of the men at the same place is: "The folks keep forw warding the 'Alumnus' and it means that PU be able to keep that contact with school and the gang. 
"After Africa and Italy I hardly know what to do in a civilized land. Here in England I re­ceived a few days leave in London. It was great. Had the first 'coke* in six months. Pass the word along that the Red Cross in I^ondon is really swell and can put yon on the risAt track; Hie destruction from the blitz, the mobilization of women, and the strict food rationing are the war­time impressions of England; not easily for­gotten. St James and Parliament are especially worthwhile. 
"I've used so many different types of money now, I feel like an international banker, only not so flush. Had a letter from D. K. Smith in the Pacific. TTie same D.K. He speaks of seeing Rlark Pfallcr and Professor Fitzgerald. 'At Salerno I ran. into Prof. Francis Hanley. 
"The morning of the Army game my mother and father attended the ^vedding of Jim ParcelL He married Gerry Ryan, a Manhattanville girl who knows your sister. After the game the folks had a chat with Jack Barry, then a midshipman at Columbia, and Marine Lt. Harry Wright. Did you hear that Wally McNamara married Ev?" Thanks for all the news, Tom. 
Two Christmas cards have arrived so far. One from Bill Terfaeyden* probably still in Jefferson Med College, Philly. He's a civilian yet, so the envelope doesn't say much. 
The other came from Bob Rogers with a note inside. Says he: "I have been out here on the Pacific coast five months now as an exec on a YP doing a little pounding up and down thji coast. Saw Bill Brady at Treasure Island and also Didc Heiser. Both in fine shape. Had a good deal of fun with Bill and *Terrib!e Tom' Tcamey, '42, who is also at the island. 
"Have heard a couple of times from Bill 0*Neil and had a card from Oren Stien. O'Neil is fiscal officer at the "William IL Harrison Hospital in Helena, Mont" 
Ed Horrmy pops up again, this time on the P^ific: "I just received my first copy of the 'Alumnus* and it sure was great to hear about our class. I ran into Bill Ford, as his ship was alongside us for several days. Bill likes duty on a 'can' and, from what I could see, I don't blame him. Steve Ensner and Bill Olvany are on de­stroyers also, but I've not seen Steve. Bill hits this port every now and then. 
"John McClare is a new arrival, but when I went to visit him at the receiving station, all I found were two huge sea chests. He must have brought enough uniforms to supply an entire ship. John 'R«d* Martin, '40, the distance run­ner, is beached here, and I see him quite often. He said his brother, *Porky,* is at Great Lakes, leading the life of Riley.' I also ran into Jerry Gainer who is now on a sub-chaser. He was a new arrival at the time, so we spent most of our short visits talking over old times. 
"Bill Fisher, as you know, is on a PT. I ran into him in Frisco, but have not seen him since Dnd Smith was also in Frisco last spring when I was stationed in the Federal Building. Just the other day I ran into Leo Sdafani. He is now a quartermaster, second class, stationed on a tug. He hopes to have his request for midshipman school approved soon. 
"I heard of a number of our classmates who are now in this area, but I've not seen them, Pat Donovan is among these. I just had a letter from Jim McElroy, ,who is now in England on an LST. He's been around a bit as he started in Africa. Bob Rihm, my old roommate, is expect­ing to leave for this area shortly. He's been at the Lido Beadi station on Long Island for a few weeks. That's all the news from the overseas areas. The rest is news you probably already know. For example, Ray Sdioonhavcn is still at Tower Hall, Chicago, and is now married. At least he stated he was to be married Dec 11, and I haven't heard since. 
"RoUl Martel is still working for the Sylvania Electric Co. back in Salem, Mass- He told me some time ago that John 'Mac' MacDowell was married and working in a defense plant some­where around school." 
Heard Bad Cans was in the South Atlantic a short time ago. One way to find Notre Dame men is to visit the chaplain wherever you go. Fve tried that several .times and heard about men. If we all do it, we won't ha\'e any more near misses like the "Bulldog" suffered. I don't even wait for Sunday and it works out. 
Only other news concerns the "Third Finger, Left Hand" dept. Ensiffn Jim Byrne slipped a diamond on the finger of Mary Ann McNamara, of Detroit, and. I might add, one of the nicest girls in the U.S.A. Congratulations. Jim. 
From Red Loncrgan: 

With Ed Roney his old efficient self, there is little work left for me. Eddy Ryan is about as lonesome as I am. He is working in a defense plant here in town. Ed ran into BiU Hidcey, '42. who is stationed in Chicago. He also runs across John "The Tree" Adams who is over Beverly Hills way, every possible week-end for a certain good reason. 
The news via the "Tribune" and Associated Press tell us that Paul Lillis is out in the South Pacific working with one of the engineering units there. A.P. sent a picture of him at work and it looked more like a portrait of Daniel Boone. Another A-P. note announced that Hany Wright and wife were now living at La Jolla, Calif., where the "Horse" is stationed. 
Snorky Buono is still with De Paul University in the army conditioning program. Boh Martin came down to the house from Great Lakes one evening. He said that Bill Olvany has been in active duty with the Navy ever since he was commissioned. Bob is now stationed at school near Providence, R. I., where he is worldng for his commission. 
Via the grape vine I heard that Ensimi Tam Callahan was seen in New York, where he was waiting for his ship. Tommy was commissioned at Columbia and then sent down to Florida for his training. George Sobck is now a lieutenant in the Navy and is on active duty in the Atlantic Steve Jazwik is stationed at Northwestern in the navy department. Ran into Keith Eperson at one of the local chows. He is at Northwestern Medi­cal Scliool, in the medical division of the army. Jim Ford is in the Army unit with Epperson at Northwestern. 
Ollie Hunter is assistant athletic officer at the Columbia Midshipman's school and has had a good season on the boards at Madison Square Garden. 
In New York on huiness I decided to have a short vacation in New England. On the way to Yale to see Vince Commisa I stopped off at Stamford, Conn., to see if by some miracle TMB Callahan might be home on furlough. His mother informed me that he was still down south. 
At Yale I ran into a bunch of Notre Dame boys. I stayed up in the barracks (a three-room Yale suite with fireplace to match) with Vince and had a long bull session with Bill CoiteDo. Then we thought there might be some Notre Dame boys on the Columbia University midship­man basketball team, which was playing at Yale. We were right as B«»bby Fai^ht set a new fieldhouse record that night and Oriando Bonicelli played a standout game. At the game we met Pat Yoklavich who is in medical school there After words we all went out and celebrated the homecoming. 
I moved on to Boston where I had hcpes of seeing Jerry Killicrew at Harvard and Ed Calla­han, who was in V-5 training near Beantown. I was disappointed on both counts, however, Jerry had just left for parts unknown and Ed was transferred down to Bainbridge, Md. 
A letter just arrived from Don Kotz. He had had letters from Walt Krawiec, who is out in the South Pacific and who would like to hear from Jim Delaney. Jim was once at Columbia with OUie Hunter but that's the last we've heard of him. Didc Creevy was stationed at Hiram, 0-, but expected to be transferred soon. Bob Rath is out at Farragut. Idaho. He was graduated from St. Louis with a math degree. The first person he met at Farragut was John Peasanclti, who is a navy chief in physical education. 
Don had also heard from Owen McGoldrick* out in California, who said that Jim Kelly was in navy aviation. Owen had met Bill Earley, Don is married, is 4-F, is working on market re­search. 
Adrian Padon is an army corporal in Italy. A late letter from Vince Commisa says that he is still at Yale, studying Japanese along with Bab Owens^ Dan Gniney and Costello. Jim Cooney is at the Yale med school with Yoklavich. Recent mail from Ed Callahan says that he is now at Columbia midshipman school, having left naval aviation on account of his bad knee. 
Bob Kaipers, now reser\'ations manager for Braniff Ainvays in Chicago, recently saw Jack Si^n, up from Streator, III., for a few days. Scoop Scanlan is now managing the public rela­tions office and athletic department at Fort Sher­idan. 
1st Lt. Joe Campagna, after thrilling experi­ences and many decorations in the European Theater, was. at the latest report, at the Sarasota Air Base, Sarasota, Fla. No word from Ensign Joe Hillebrand since last summer, when he w'as c/o FPO, N.Y.C. Ralph Onofrio is in the Navy and a medical student at St. Louis Unfversity. Ensign Jtrfin Harriffan is Navy Number 128. FPO, San Francisco. Lou Rymkos was inducted into the Navy at Great Lakes. 
Ensicn Clair Lambert was in the Pacific. Com­missioned a second lieutenant at the Tank De­stroyer OCS, Camp Hood, Texas, on Jan. 28 was Ha ^ Adams. Dippy Evans is an aviation cadet at Enid Army Air Field, Enid. Okla. Lt. Ed Mc-Kim, USMCt writes from the Southwest Pacific to send his contribution to the Alumni Fund. Ed had seen several Notre Dame men, among them Capt. Bob Hackman, '38. Lt. Bill Hofer, '39. Capt. Joe Marqacen, '40, Lt. John Clifford, '42. and Ffc Charley Rogers, ex. '44. 
Don Heltzel still writes often, and in that dis­tinctive Si>encerian hand, Don, when he wrote on March 14, had seen Bob Hargrave at Mass a few Sundays back. And Don was hoping to see soon his recently-wedded former roommate. Boh BfOwninTf who was reported to be somewhere in the same general vicinity in the South Pacific. 
Don had run into Tom Conley* who was on his way to an LST. Tom had seen Jack Dngan and Frank Conforti in Frisco on the way out. 
From Ed Roney (written for the April issue): 
The first letter is from Rip Collins, with "South Pacific" up in the comer. Says he: "Well. Fve never written before—^but this lonely tropi­cal island has changed my mind, after I read the December 'Alumnus.* 
"So far I haven't run into anyone whom I knew from N.D. down this way, although I hear that there are some on the island. I ran into a Marine lieutenant though, who went to candi­date school with Big Mike Mines. 
"As for myself, I'm living and liking the li/e of a Seabee. 
**The last I heard from BiU Mencel was in 

Buffalo with Curtiss-Wright—and the father of a future N.D. man. Tom Farmer was in Bridge­port. Conn., with Voueht Sikorsky. Ensten Jack Dncsan was at diesel school in Berkeley, Calif. Ensisrn Hank ReiUy was at Flint. Mich., study­ing diesel. CpL Harry 0*AIealia was in desert training in California. I was practically next door to him for a month before I left the states and I didn't know until I reached Guadalcanal and received his letter. 
"The last I heard of Bob Gillette and BiU 01­v«ny was when I graduated from Prairie State with them." 
I was transferred from my ship to the Staff of the Commander. South Atlantic Forces, with duties in communications, late in January. I can positively assure all of you that the Solant fish were not undernourished while I was ahoard. Jim Girard replaced me after being transferred from another ship. He had organized a cham­pionship basketball team which had yet to lose and had played three or four exhibition games last I heard. That's very good as there are some mighty fine teams do^vn here. 
Lt. (JK> Bob Mallen, *38. is down here and I see a lot of him also. Then, too. there is Ed Harrey operating out of here. I haven't seen him as yet. 
This next week I'm leaving on detached duty out in the middle of the jungle. That's the place where the rain, boa constrictors and crocodiles are in abundance. It should prove exceptionally interesting. Tlie column will still be ground out. however. 
Our second letter comes from Charley Stelt­mann also do.vn in the South Pacific: 
". . . After that fateful December day . . . I rushed oft home and then rushed right back to Chicago. .. . At Tower, the 'better half of Abbott,' I ran into the whole gang in my class. Chack Kralavec, Hank Kmne, Mark Lies, Bill HcCaushey, Jack Beis, Clair Lambert* Pat Don­ovan, and so many others T can't remember them all. 
"From Tower I went off with that nice new stripe and star to Miami. . . . Down there were about half those who had gone to Chicago, plus Bill Stewert and Joe Tracy, who were in khaki on the beach. . . . 
"I'm officially supply and commissary, engi­neering, and gunnery officer [on an SC] and be­lieve it or not I'm actually beginning to learn a bit about the jobs of each. As a matter of fact, I wouldn't trade this ship for all the duty in the Navy. . . . 
"On one of our escort jobs to a little island back in November (I think it was November) I ran into a lad named FitzHarris from the class of '-10 and he had an old 'Alumnus,' the first I'd seen since my 'boot leave.' I ran into Pat Dono­van down here the other day and he had the October issue. It was great to see the old haunts again, if only in pictures and disfigured as they are by the exigencies of war. (I got that word from Father Laakowski or Prof. Tom Stritdi, I can't remember which). Pat tells me that he had seen Bill Fisher (golf and Navy) and Bibs Sweeney out here. .. . I noticed my name in the October issue followed by a plain USNK-Be it hereby known that I am officially a mem­ber of that great organization of which the members are disparagingly referred to as being a 'dime a dozen!' Did I hear somebody say 'En­signs?' " 
I heard some time ago that a picture of Fnin­nie Cammings, the "RajahV sister, appeared in the "Scholastic" as guest of honor of this year's K. of C. ball. But where is the "Kajah?" 
And where also are BUI HeCaasfaey, Jade GUB* gan. Bob Walsh, JeriT Gainor, and the others who promised to write? And where are the many, many others who haven't been heard from or about since IZjZQjAZ. 
Two letters, even as good as they are, are not a good showing from 400 men. 
I forgot to mention, I believe, in the last edi­tion, that Stan Fytitz's mother had written me about the same time that he did to tell where he was and what he was doing. That's the fifth family to write. Many more are needed and de­sired. 
See you again in two months during which time I hope to be able to finish answering all the men who have written to me. I don't have much time but I'm trying to clear it all up.

From Dave Condon: I was reading a letter from Ens. Don Bdtad, now on duty in the South Pacific, and he asked if I ever heard from Bob Dnnne, when the tap of a hand on my shoulder showed Ihmne, dressed 
in the olive drab, behind me. He said that Lake Hicgins is in the camp with him. Everyone knows that Jimmy Bblfe was married; saw him and Boh Hanlon the day before the wedding, and-later saw him down on the campus one Son-day. 
Saw Hcrhic Cidcman the other day. He -was in South Bend for a couple of days. Bay DoBevan sends letters from his new job in Logansport. Ind., with the pai>er there. Dick MeHa^ wrote from Blanhattan, III., and plans to vi^t the eain­pus soon. Dick Bams is still at Loyola, they tell me.

"The boys really enjoy reading the 'Alonmus* and keeping track of their buddies wherever they are. The copies are passed around so that every­one gets a crack at them." 
ON WITH THE DANCE 

Nine hundred y-12 trainees and their guests attended, on Jan. 14 in the cam­pus navy drill hall, vrhat was prohably up to then 'the largest Notre Dame dance of all time. But the campus. ci­vilians proportionately did almost as well when 200 couples of them attended a dance in the Indiana Club, South Bend, on Feb. 14, sponsored by the Notre Dame K. of C. The N.E.O.T.C. enjoyed on Feb. 11 in the Service Men's Center, South Bend, what turned out to be a farewell ball for the first of their group to be commissioned. A navy rul­ing about the time of the dance had ordered commissions to be awarded to 77 N.R.O.T.C. men after seven semes­ters, instead of the expected eight, of Notre Dame work. 
The American Midland Naturalist 
The appearance of the first number of "The Midland Nat­uralist" in April, 1909, marks the beginning of the first learned journal published by the University of Notre Dame. Soon its name was changed to the American Midland Nat­iiralist and as such it has been issued uninterruptedly ever since. During its early existence its founder and fii'st editor, the late Eev. Julius A. Nieuwland, C.S.C., succeeded in gain­ing for the new journal its unique place among American learned publications in the field of natural history. In addi­tion. Father Nieuwland was also one of the most prolific con­tributors. He published almost all of his botanical writings in the American Midland Naturalist. 
The early volumes of the American Midland Naturalist thus bespeak the vitality and ^^sion of its founder and first editor as well as the active spirit then present in the Depart­ment of Biology. Gradually Father Nieuwland's interests in research in organic chemistry outdistanced his active work in botany. -As a result the journal changed its original char­acter and more and more contributions were received from the outside. This change was a verj' significant one, inas­much as the journal assumed gi-eater national and interna­tional importance. In fact, its present contributors include investigators in all important American institutions of learn­ing such as universities, museums, botanical gardens, re­search laboratories, etc., as well as contributors from Canada and various European and -Asiatic countries. 
Since 1930 tliis change is reflected also in the ever increas­ing total number of pages published per year. Th older vol­umes for the most part covered a period of two yeai*s at §3.00 per volume, whereas at the present time two volumes appear per year each containing roughly 750-800 pages at the annual subscription price of $5.00. Tliis expansion obvi­ously reaches across the original geographical limitations implied by the designation midland. T-he territory now cov­ered by the journal might well be identified with the bound­aries of the United States, although the emphasis still remains on the natural Hstory of the middle west. 
After 25 years of continued service as editor. Father Nieuwland retired from this position at the end of 1934 and appointed as his successor the present editor, who had been associated \vith him since 1930 as assistant editor. For some time the journal has benefited from the cooperation of asso­ciate editors representing various fields of specialization. Two of these have passed away in recent years, Rev. Francis 
J. Wenninger, C.S.C, dean of the College of Science at the time of his death, and the late Dr. Marcus Ward Lyon, path­ologist at the South Bend Clinic. The present editorial staff includes: Edward A. Chapin, U. S. National Museum, Wash­ington, D. C, for Entomology; Kenneth W. Cooper, Prince­ton University, Princeton, N. J., for Cj-tology and Genetics; Carroll Lane Fenton, New Brunswick, N. J., for Invertebrate Paleontologj'; John Hobart Hoskins, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, 0., for Paleobotany; Remington Kellogg, U. S. National Museum, Washington, D. C, for Mammalogy; Jean MjTon Linsdale, Hastings Reservation, Monterey, Calif., for Ornithology; George Willard Martin, State University of Iowa, Iowa City, la., for Mycology; Karl Patterson Schmidt, Chicago Natural Histoiy Museum, Chicago, HI., for Ich­thyology and Herpetology; and Harley Jones Van Cleave, University of Illinois, Urbana, HI., for Invertebrate Zoology. 
Although the journal has from its beginning been "Devot­ed to Natural History, Primarily That of the Prairie States," this policy was never interpreted in its narrowest possible sense. As a result, contributions have been published rang­ing from the Arctic to Patagonia and from the lowest forms of life to the.highest, both living and extinct, plant or animal. Included were also contributions dealing with laboratory tech­niques, teaching methods, and others of a more general char­acter, but in nearly all cases these too were based on original research. The principal fields of biological knowledge repre­sented are all those dealing with plants and animals except the few identified entirely as laboratory sciences. 
Many contributions appearing in the American Midlatid Naturalist have great and immediate practical application. Numerous microscopic fossils described in the pages of the journal are of definite value to the oil geologist in identifying and correlating strata, or to the coal geologist for similar purposes. Other contributions are of real importance to par­asitologists, epidemiologists, veterinarians, entomologists and public health officers. Still others can be used with great benefit by foresters and those engaged in the conservation of wildlife and natural resources. 
For many years copies of the journal have gone out to practically all comers of the earth. In return, the University has received hundreds of valuable serial and individual pub­lications of learned societies, institutions, universities, and private individuals, domestic and foreign, as well as valuable collections of thousands of biological specimens. The demand for the journal has grown to such an extent that complete sets of it are no longer available and are now great rarities in the secondhand book market. 
In the future larger manuscripts will appear as individual monograplis, the first of which is now in preparation and is expected to come off the press in the spring of 1944. This monograph is devoted to a detailed study of the ticks famed as vectors of relapsing fever, etc. under the title "The -Arga­sidae of North -America, Central America, and Cuba." It was written by Drs. R. A. Cooley and Glen M. Kohls, who are associated with the Rocky Mountain Laboratory, United States Public Health Service, Hamilton, Mont. -Also in prep­aration is a "Flora of Illinois" by Dr. George Neville Jones of the University of Illinois, the first inclusive flora of that state ever completed. 
The July, 1943, issue appeared as a Centennial Issue to commemorate a doubly auspicious occasion, e. g., the end of the centenary year of the University of Notre Dame and the 100th anniversary of the birth of the late Edward Lee Greene, whose remarkable herbarium and botanical library are among the cherished possessions of the Univereity. The contributions included were prepared by members of the faculty and by graduate students of the Depart­ment of Biolog}', and by the editorial staff of the journal. The Centennial Issue was published as a token in recognition of the service rendered by the Universitj' of Notre Dame as a benefactor of science through its continued sponsorship of the American Midland Naturalist.—Tlicodor Just, Editor.
