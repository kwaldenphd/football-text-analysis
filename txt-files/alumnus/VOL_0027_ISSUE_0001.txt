A Notre Dame Contribution 
The 


Natural Law Institute 
"In a world engulfed by pragmatic ma­terialism, the Institute attempts to reaffirm the proposition that the roots of all human liberty may continue to rest, with safety, only in a recognition of the immutability of the principles of justice and the universality of morality." 
These are words taken from the official program of the second annual National Law Institute, conducted at the University on Friday and Saturday, Dec. 10 and 11. They tell, in brief, the meaning of one of the Uni­versity's outstanding contributions to pres­ent-day living. 
The Natural Law Institute, undertaken for the first time in 1947 with the financial support of the Notre Dame Club of New York, came to new stature and %vider recog­nition in 1948 and promises to reach even fuller development in 1949. 
The two-day program in December was devoted to the historic development of the natural law and to an exposition of the status of natural law in American jurisprudence. Participating were many alumni, especially from 'the legal fields, and many faculty mem­bers and Notre Dame students. 
To quote again the official program of the Institute: "The second annual proceed­ings will emphasize the historical roots of natural theory in five distinct eras of world history. Unless one agrees with Hegel that

'we learn nothing from history except the fact that we learn nothing from history,' the proceedings of the second Institute, and the five distinguished lectures it presents, shoidd be a rich harvest of knowledge. The similarities and dissimiliarities in the theories of the natural law among the civilizations should serve to stimulate fresh reflections among those who yearn for a solid theory of certainty and truth upon which to buttress the failing hopes of salvation for a worid over which the air hangs heavy in the fear-inspiring silence before an atomic cataclysm. The hour is late, but the Natural Law Insti­tute believes we have, not only the time, but the heavy moral obligation to find the right answers."

He is the author of "The Spirit of the Legal Profession" and the "Eternal Lawyer" and a trustee of Oberlin College and Western Reserve University. 
Archbishop Schulte Honorary Chairman 
Most Rev. Paul C. Schulte, D.D., arch­bishop of Indianapolis, was the honorary chairman of the second annual Natural Law Institute. Rev. John J. Cavanaugh, C.S.C, president of the University, was the presid­ing officer. Alvin A. Gould, Cincinnati busi­nessman, was the sponsor. 
The Institute was measurably aided by the efforts of some Notre Dame clubs which, utilizing a script written by the Department of Public Information, arranged for broad­casts on local radio stations. 

"The problem of the natural law is cer­tainly one of the most ancient in human thought as well as one of the most subtle in its aspects and one of the most far-reaching in its conclusions," said Dr. Lebel. "The expression 'natural' law is ambiguous, confusing and misleading; it means natural justice, that is to say, an inner sentiment of right and wrong, which is to be found everywhere in all men; it is not written, it is proper to human nature, it is a thing of reason; all men have a natural, infallible and practical knowledge of it; man must do good and avoid evil; he who sins shoidd be punished; damage done must be repair­ed; man must preserve his own being. All these precepts belong to the nature of man, they are the very expression of the universal idea of justice. 
Poets and Philosophers 

"The Greek poets and the Greek philoso­phers have expressed this anew in different terms. Poets considered the natural law as a gift of the gods, as something higher than the law of the State and to be found in the reason of man, for man alone has a sense of right and wrong. Philosophers conceived the natural law as something based upon equal­ity, reason, justice; it is something universal, it does not change, there is only one. The idea of natural law took several centuries to be expressed properly; the Greeks coined the proper words to express it." 
Dr. Levy declared that "the Romans made two main contributions to the idea of (Continued on Page 18)

Letter to the Alumni Board 
By Harry G. Hogan, '04 
President oi the Alumni Association 
[Ed. Note: In this letter to the Alumni Board, Harry Hogan has caught so much of the spirit of both the Alumni Association and Foundation program that the ALUMNUS feels all alumni should share it.] 
Gentlemen and Fellow Alumni, Members of the 1948 Board of Directors: 
It is not easy to encompass in a short mes­sage to you on the eve of our last Board meeting the many things that should be said. 
Primarily, and sincerely, I wish to thank you for your aid and your understanding in directing the Alumni Association to the crea­tion of a program that grows in its signifi­cance for Notre Dame even as it pursues its internal organization program and problems. 
We may not wish to wear the laurels, and perhaps even the bestowing of them may not be in order for years to come. But I am certain that the University of Notre Dame Foundation, as it now exists and functions, will one day be the successful answer of No­tre Dame to the great economic challenges of the present educational era. 
Bigger Than Bricks, More Than Mortar From the beginning of my term it was obvious that we were striving for more than architectural growth. 
Bricks and mortar, even men, may fail to meet the needs of the time, but it is incon­ceivable that Notre Dame should fail in her vital mission, that is so much more than ed­ucation. 
This is the spirit behind the Foundation, a spirit older than American university life, older than Western civilization—as old, in fact, as man's knowledge that he is made in the image and likeness of God and is possessed of certain unalienable rights. It is the spirit which has defined and defended these rights through all the ages of history until they culminated in the rich expression of American democracy, of which Notre Dame stands so vitally and really as a symbol. 
Our Early Statements Still Stand 

In our first official expression as a Foun­dation, "Immovably Upon the Moveless Rock," wherein we quoted this indomitable spirit as exemplified in Father Sorin, we said: 
". . . You and I are the ones who must convey our understanding of our cause, our opportunities and our corroUary needs to our countless friends who want to serve and safeguard their nation and their society ex­actly as Notre Dame can. Many of these friends will recognize instantly that wc are offering more help than we are asking." 
(The truth of this lies in the non-alumni who are serving as a part of our Foundation organization, and the many who have in­creased the total giving record of our non-alumni friends to practically double its 1947 total.) 
And in the newest Foundation book— "The Substance of Things Hoped For"— which reflects the maturity of our organiza­tion and the dignity of our cause, and the rich religious overtone that motivates us, we have summed up the deeper significances of participation in this work: "So it is with nearly every man. When he has fought a good fight, and run a good race, and the shadows begin to lengthen, and the stars to come out, there springs within him a vital hope: a hope that his last remaining deci­sions may result in lasting good. Word it 
Vhoto hy Allen C. homont 
HABBY G. HOGAN 

as he may, it is his wish to know, love and serve God—and to help those whom he leaves behind to prepare for the same eternal salvation which he hopes, with a faith which gives it substance, is at hand for his own soul." 
An Academic Armageddon 

We know, because the handwriting is clear on our wall, that the religious essences channeling through education are now sole­ly in the hands of private education. 
And in a challenging corollary we know that private education is waging an econom­ic battle which can only be won by the un­selfish sacrifices of its friends to an extent never before demanded. 
If morality and, education are to remain the hand-in-hand necessities of good govern­ment, then Notre Dame is a fortress of faith in God and faith in our whole American pattern of life. 
This is the great cattsc to which we have dedicated the Notre Dame Foundation. 
Organixcrtion Necessary 

Only the spirit of a nation can win a war. But its armies and its navies and its air power, its production lines and its re­search, must join in the winning of its battles. 
So we' must have at Notre Dame the physical weapons for our greater cause. We have the long-established and deep-rooted Alumni Association with its great traditions and its constantly growing personnel, indoc­trinated and properly armed for the battles of the age. 
It is to insure our increasing army of fighters of the most modem and progressive protection that we need to go into the ex­pansion program for our physical plant, our faculty, and the activities that produce officer material—the moral and responsible leadership of which we arc justly proud, and to which we are irrevocably committed. 
. The First Major Engagement 

We have had a part of 1947 and all of 1948 in which to prepare our manpower. We have tested our strength in the advance through the rather open areas of general, unrestricted giving. 
Our first major engagement comes in 1949 with the projection of the raising of $1,400,000 for the new Science Building by the University of Notre Dame Foundation. 
Notre Dame has watched our apprentice­ship, our training camp activities. Now the first major issue is squarely in the forces of the Foundation. 
I think that the Alimini Association, foster-father of the Foundation, can watch our organization move forward confident of its accomplishment. 
The Broader Program 

And while the Foundation organization moves into its first major struggle to supply the physical weapons to arm the growing legions of Notre Dame, the Alumni Associa­tion must at the same time look to the Notre Dame spirit, the replacements, the post-war planning, and other broader phases, of the constant war. 
With the Foundation well established, the Alumni Board is in an excellent strategic pc»­sition to take up as both the deeper cause and the richer purpose of fund-raising those activities which will encompass the spiritual, the cultural, the fraternal, the business and professional, the social, and the recreational aspects of alumni life. From aU of these high potentials come the factors that make our ultimate victory secure. 
The Notre Dome Alumnus aimed to offset the harmful influence of 
many juvenile and comic books. 


Holy Cross Fathers Take

Editorial and business oSSces of the mag­
Father Frank Gartland, C.S.C., '33 (cen­ter) has just been appointed editor of The Catholic Boy, magazine for boys from 11 to 15, recently purchased by the Holy Cross Fathers. Father Richard J. Grimm, C.S.C., (right) superior of Holy Cross Seminar)-, where Father Gartland had been teaching a course in writing, planned a great day for The Catholic Boy Dec. 8: Solemn Mass at 8:30, Business Session at 10:00, banquet at noon. Sisters Zacharia, Amata and St. Rita, S.N.D., had their fingers in the special "Catholic Boy" cake (foreground) baked for the occasion. George Drummey (left), presi­dent of Drummey Cartage Co., South Bend, is a member of the advisory business board. Other members are William Lubbers, head of the Reco sports goods store in South Bend, Louis Chapleau, '30, attorney, Dennis O'Neill, '26, of the Cleveland ofiice of the Darcy Advertising Co., and Frank Bruce of the Bruce Publishing Co., Milwaukee. 
Here is a preview of some of the talent lined up for the revamped Catholic Boy: Jimmy Powers of the N. Y. Daily News, brother of Father Joe Powers, C.S.C., '37, Tom Powers, '42, and John Powers, '43; Bob Coyne of the Boston Post; Clem Lane of the Chicago Daily News; Jack Connor of the Minneapolis Star-Tribune; Mark Kearney, long connected with the Family Theater, Hollywood; Joe Dever, author of "No Last­ing Home," Milwaukee; Father John A. O'Brien, professor of Apologetics at Notre Dame; Joe O'Brien, '37, St. Thomas Mili­tary Academy, St. Paul; Norb Engels, '26, professor of English at Notre Dame; and a 
host of others: Present circulation is 55,000. Most press­
ing need is to raise this figure to 100,000, for until then The Boy must run at a deficit to the Congregation.

Father Steiner Prize 
To Be Established 
B7 Walter L. ShUts, '22 

Under the leadership of Edward Cant-well, C.E., '24, a group of Father Thomas 
A. Steiner's C.S.C., former students have started a fund in honor of one of Notre Dame's outstanding educators. It seems that during a game of golf on the William J. Burke course last summer, some remarks were exchanged concerning Father Steiner and his seemingly unceasing interest in for­mer students and graduates of the College of Engineering. One remark led to another, and the discussion finally culminated in the thought that many of these men would like to see Father Steiner honored by the estab­lishment of a prize bearing his name. As a result Ed Cantwell solicited a few of the engineers trained by Father Steiner, for con­tributions - toward this fund, to establish a Father Steiner Prize to be "based not on engineering scholastic record alone, but also on other activities, thereby encouraging en­gineers to become leaders among their as­sociates." 
The result is that within a very short time these few men sent in contributions totaling $520. The lespoose was very grati^ng. The letters accompanying the checks sent in were most complimentary to Father Steiner, and have been passed on to him so that he may

enjoy reading them and reminiscing. 
The Father Steiner Prize, has the whole­hearted approval of the University Adminis­tration and of the Foundation. Those of the Engineering faculty whose privilege it was to work with and under Father Steiner for so many years are most happy to see him so honored. 
It was not the intention of those who ini­tiated this prize to make it an exclusive pro­ject, but rather to try with a few names to see what response might be expected. Many of Father Steiner's close friends were not solicited and many of these will surely wish to assist in the establishment of this prize. The contribution of any former student of 
D. J. Sweeney, Jr., harbor master and su­perintendent of wharves and piers in Galves­ton, Texas, provided the ALTJMNUS with this unusual picture of the SS "George Gipp." In September, 1948, the "George Gipp" docked at Galveston to take on a cargo of EGA wheat, 322,336 bushels, destined for the starving of Europe. This was, Mr. Sweeney.said, the third trip which the ship had made to the port of Galveston in 1948. 
"The only thing I regret," writes Mr. 
Father Steiner will be most welcome, and will be credited to the ftmd if so maiked. The income {torn this fund will be a cash award to a student in the College of En­gineering selected by a faculty committee and carrying the name "The Father Steiner Prize." Contributions may be addressed to Edward G. Cantwell, C<intwdl Machinery Co., 830 Cassady Ave., Columbus. O.

Five hundred dollars in prizes will be awarded in the new John E. Moore Prize competition for the best essays on "Amer­icanism and Catholic Thought," it was an­nounced in December by Rev. John J. Burke, C.S.C., chairman of the committee on scholarships and prizes. 
The awards, called the J(dui E. Moore '08, Prizes, are open to undergraduates only. A grand prize of $250 and five individual prizes of $50 each will be presented to the winners at commencement in June. The grand prize winner will be selected from the five individual winners. The donor of the prizes, a resident of Michigan, is the Notre Dame Foundation Governor of Michigan.

UNIVERSITY 
By EDWAHD A. FISCHER, '37 
MANY BABIES, in years to come, may owe thanks to Notre Dame scientists for sav­ing their lives. The reason: Two chemical compounds capable of neutralizing dan­gerous Rh antibodies in the blood have been isolated here for the first time. The anti­bodies cause miscarriages, still-births, and, in the case of newborn infants, jaundice and other blood diseases. 
The discovery was reported in an article by Dr. Charles C. Price, head of the Depart­ment of Chemistr)', in "The Journal of the American Chemical Society." 
The project is still in the experimental and clinical stage. If Dr. Price and associ­ates can determine the structure of the com­pounds, they will be able to synthesize the compounds and use them to fight Rh anti­bodies. 
DB. CHABIES C PBICE 
The only great danger from the Rh factor in human blood results from pregnancy in­volving a husband with Rh positive type blood and a wife with Rh negative t>-pe. 
Working with Dr. Price on the project, which is being assisted by the Eli Lily Com­pany, Indianapolis, are Dr. Chaidao Chen, of Hunan, China, research associate in chemistry at Notre Dame, and Arthur S. Sinclair, Elkhart, Ind., and Richard Mitch, Rochester, N. Y., research fellows in chem­istry. Two former research fellows, Thomas Bardos, Budapest, and David Read, Seattle, Wash., have worked on the local project. 


TODAY 
A HEART ATTACK was fatal to Dr. Zol­tan Baranyai, lecturer in political science at Notre Dame and former consul general for Hungary in Chicago. He was minister ol foreign affairs in Budapest before he was forced to flee the nazi invasion. 
THE OLD GREY MARE might again be what she used to be, if Dr. Alex B. Todd is successful in his experiments. Dr. Todd. British research chemist, gave the 1948 Nieuwland Memorial Lectures at Notre Dame and told about an energy produc­ing substance, referred to as A.T.P., with which he is working. 
He explained it tiiis way: "When an athlete runs 100 yards he needs a lot of energy, a lot more than he can produce at that speed and in that short time by burning up the food which he has con­stmied. Therefore, a storehouse of energy is needed. This storehouse in the muscles is filled with A.T.P., which undergoes a kind of chemical reaction as it breaks down into energy. When the strenuous actiTily stops, the reserroir of A.TJ>. is again built up. 
"You can see, of course, that muscular fatigue is caused by the draining away of all the A.T.P. This is why you get tired after strenuous exercise and finally col­lapse if you reach the point where you have no A.TJ>. left." 
Dr. Todd, who pioneered vitamin re­search, and his associates have found o way to produce A.T.P. artificially in fair sized amounts. 
AN INDUSTRIALIST and two magazine editors were the most recent speakers in the Bishop O'Hara Seminar Lecture Series of nine talks. They were: Harry Rogers, an executive of the Hughes Tool Company, Houston, Tex., Stuart Henritz, of New York, editor of "Purchasing Magazine," and Stanley Hunt, editor of "Organon Maga­zine," published by the Textilex Research Institute of New York.

MBS. CLABE BOOTH LUCE said. "The drama of the Moss is MO magnificently coaliivad that I cannot see why it did not occor to me eariier that it must be divine drama, created by the master hand."

greot drama of the Cruciiixian. Mrs. Luce 
told her listeners. "The olheist denies that 
the drama eve/ occurred: the Jew believes 
it occurred only up to the last two ocls: 
the Protestant believes it occurred once 
2J0O0 yeors ago and that it can never hap­
pen again: the Catholic believes that it 
happened then and that it happens con­
stantly in its mystic reenactment in the 
Mass." 
Mrs. Luce, who was converted to the 

Church in 1946, soid that as o playwright 
she was first oltracted to Catholicism by 
what she described as "the divine s'age­
crah of the Mass."

"The battleship has become obsolescent. 
Some will be kept for bombardment pur­
poses and for gun fire support for landing 
forces in amphibious operations. But no 
more ships like the Missouri will ever be 
built."

AMERICAN PRIVATE ENTERPRISE must regain the confidence of the public, and it is up to the American business leader to prove that the system can be both able and honest, said Dean James E. McCarthy, of the College of Commerce, when he ad­dressed a dinner meeting of the National In­dustrial Conference Board in the Waldorf-Astoria. 
Dean McCarthy charged that the govern­ment has stepped out of its position of serv­ant to assume the role of master. He said that the business leader must dispel the fog of suspicion and distrust in which he has been forced to operate for the past 15 years.

The Proposed New Science Building 
With the proposed new Science Building, the University and the Notre Dame Foundation present the first of the urgent problems that campus postwar devel­opments have spotlighted. From the standpoint of academic urgency, the Science Building emerged from the many projects as the indisputable first con­sideration. Alumni are familiar enough with the long and illustrious history of Science at Notre Dame to be thoroughly convinced of its merits. Knowledge of work being done today serves only to multiply these already established values. 
This is the front elevation of our proposed new Science Bui/ding. The cosf of the building is estimated at $1,750,000. Unrestricted contributions to Notre Dame in 1946 and 1947 have built up a fund of $350,000 wfiicfi the University has designated as the beginning of the Science BuHding Fund. The alumni of Notre Dame and the Notre Dame Foundation have been asked to raise the remaining $1,400,000 so that the University may begin construction in 1949.

There is no desire to establish "quotas" in the "drive" sense, or to push alumni or friends beyond their willingness or ability to give. Buf in ihe realization of the specific Science Building project in 1949, we face the realities of costs, and we believe that some projection of indicated divisions of the total figure will be of help to individual alumni, to friends, and particularly to the Foundation Gty Committees. The following unit cost estimates of the Science Building indicate a method by which individuals. Clubs and Committees might sponsor such units.

The Notre Dame Alumnus 




lU STUDENTS 
B7 MABTm BROWNE 

Christmas—Bememker? Christmas vacation was the high point of student activities since the last issue of the ALUMNUS. Thousands of students headed homeward at noon, Dec. 21, by trains, buses, planes, cars, boats, by thumb and even, we suspect, by horseback. (In a school where a Dominican civil engineering professor dashes about on a motorcycle, anything is possible.) Disappointment because Notre Dame's vacation began several days later than that of most other universities was for­gotten in the delight of heading home. 
In many cities student organizations join­ed with alumni clubs in dances and other festivities during the holidays. It was all over on Jan. 5 when the thousands returned for the long grind until a late Easter, for which the administration accepts no respon­sibility. 
Christmas festivities in Vetville included a stag party, and two children's parties, one for the Vetville children, another for the children of all married veterans. 
-*­
Howard Hall captured first place in the annual hall decoration contest, which was held the week-end of the Northwestern game, with the theme "Frank Leahy Builds a Dream House." Badin was second with a timely satire on election polls. 
Campus Badio Expands 
WND, the campus radio station, has re­cently added a number of interesting fea­tures to its programs. These include two weekly programs of campus news, a fivc­nighls-a-week all-request program, and con­tinuous entertainment on Sunday evenings from 7 to 10. Home basketball games are aired for the benefit of those who cannot at­tend, with Frank Tripucka as announcer. Studios are in the G>Tn, upstairs in the old apparatus room. 
-*­
Socials in the Vetville Recreation hall for graduate students, their wives and friends have been well received. A monthly Mass is offered in Alumni Hall for this same group. 
There arc thirty foreign students pursuing graduate studies at Notre Dame during the present semester. 
Of particular interest are Pierre Bellman, young newspaper correspondent, writer and student of international affairs from Ve­vey Switzerland, Paul Chang of Antug, Manchuria, political science student, who did espionage work for the American In­telligence Strategic Service unit in Shang-



TODAY 

hai during the war, and Ernest Haindl of Vienna, former foot soldier in the German army, who is here on a scholarship awarded by the National Catholic Welfare Confer­ence.

Pass — Aristotle to Brennan 
Halfback Terry Brennan and guard Jack Connor appeared (not in uniform) on the Great Books foundation weekly television show over station WENR-TV in Chicago in November. They discussed "Aristotle's Ethics" on the program with Rev. John J. Cavanaugh, C.S.C. Mike Swistowicz was an alternate for the show. Brennan is a philoso­phy major. 
If any alumni have problems of finance (joke!), they will be interested in the tvvice­monthly meetings of the newly-organized Finance Club in the College of Commerce, which discusses these problems. Send along your budget figures, complete with red ink. 
Angela boule\'ard, at the edge of the St. Mary's campus, is the site of an unusual home erected by John Merrion, architec­tural engineering student, for himself and his wife, Mary Ann, who is a student at St. Mary's. With the help of his father, Joseph Merrion, builder of a number of housing projects in Chicago, the parts of the all-frame house were cut and assembled on the site of one of these projects, then transported to South Bend on a truck and trailer driven by young Merrion. The home was erected with the help of fellow stu­dents from Notre Dame, while Mary Ann's friends assisted in decorating the attractive three-room dwelling. 
Dances, Bowling — Even Bridge 
A Senior Ball for the Januar>- graduates, first such affair in the history of Notre Dame, will be held in the East Dining Hall on Jan. 28, with the pat theme "June in January." Other winter formal events, past and present, are the K. of C. Formal, the Law Ball and Sophomore Cotillion, all held in November, the NROTC Ball to be held on Jan. 15, and the Engineers Ball, a pre­war social tradition, which will be revived Feb. 11. 
Intense interest in intramural sports con­tinues. Dillon Hall beat Cavanaugh by a close 6-2 to capture the interhall football championship. 
Basketball got under way in December, with 52 teams divided into five leagues to compete for the title won by St. Edward's Hall last year. 
The volleyball championship has already been settled, with the New England club on top, followed by the Rhode Island club. 
Two bowling leagues, the Blue and the Gold, give 700-800 Notre Dame students a chance to compete for sizeable cash prizes

For those who prefer to pursue their 

sports sittmg down, there is the bridge tour­
nament, sponsored by the Notre Dame 
Council of the K. of C. Duplicate bridge 
sessions are held every Wednesday evening 
in the council's Walsh Hall club rooms, and 
steps are being taken for participation in the 
National Intercollegiate Bridge tournaments. 
Other interhall sports which are planned 

are wrestling tournaments, a handball com­
petition, and several swimming meets.'

And Music. Too 
A near-capacity audience attended the first concert of the year of the Notre Dame Orchestra, under the direction of Prof. Charles Biondo, in Washington Hall, Nov. 
23. Charles Leinhart was piano soloist. Pre-holiday concerts were also given by the Glee Club, directed by Prof. Daniel H. 
Pedtke, and by the Notre Dame Band, under the direction of Prof. H. Lee Hope. 
The Liturgy Club commemorated the forty-fifth anniversary of the "Motu Pro­prio" on Sacred Music published by Pope Pius X, with a High Mass sung by the club choir in Gregorian chant, and a Communion breakfast on Nov. 21. Rev. (now Rt. Rev. Msgr.) William J. Doheny, C.S.C., was moderator of the club before his departure for Rome. Rev. William J. McAuliffe, C.S.C., professor of liturgical chant at Mo­reau Seminary, directs the club choir.

Lloyd A. Bechamp, C.S.C., of Morcau Seminary, who is studying sculpturing and ceramics under Prof. Eugene Kormendi, won third prize with his sculptured "Madonna" bust in a recent art show in Cincinnati, O., sponsored by the American Seminarian's War Relief Mission for the benefit of Euro­pean seminarian relief. Art objects,, con­tributed by seminarians from all over the country, were sold for CARE packages, to be sent to European seminarians. 
Bo7 Meets Girl — Sunday Afternoon 
Freshmen are being given an opportunity to meet girls at St. Mary's College, St. Jo­seph and St. Mary's academies, and St. Jo­seph Hospital School of Nursing through a series of Sunday afternoon informal socials sponsored by the freshman Young Chris­tian Students organization. Students from each of the participating schools take part in a short program of entertainment, followed by dancing and—of course—food. Inciden­tally, these aifairs also give the girls an op­portunity to meet the boys. 
Notre Dame took first place m the Na­tional Invitational Forensic Conference held at Purdue in November, winning eight out of ten contests. At the .University of Iowa vidual debater, while Frank Finn tied for first place in extemporaneous speaking. The team is engaged in an intensive schedule of intercollegiate contests. 
John Engels, a freshman in the Notre Dame ROTC, is believed to be the only present student both of whose parents have degrees from Notre Dame. His mother, El­eanor Perry Engels, received an M.A. from the University in 1933, and his father, Nor­bert Engels, '26, famed as trombone player in Harry Denny's orchestra of hallowed mem­ory, poet, essay writer, hunter and expert cabinet maker, is a professor of English at Notre Dame. 
BRIEFS: Notre Dame, like the nation, picked Dewey in the Scholastic straw votes, and Truman at the polls. The 850 voters who appeared at the Fieldhouse polls gave Dewey 396, Truman 471 votes. . . . Elmer Layden, Jr., was elected vice-president of the freshman class. . . . Notre Dame con­tributes $10,000,000 a year to South Bend business according to a survey conducted by the Notre Dame Department of Public Information in conjunction with the Scho­lastic. This includes outlays by students, visitors to football games, operating expenses by the University and money spent by visi­tors drawn to the city by the school for various reasons. . . . The drive for European Student Relief, accelerated by the bait of 
Uord Bechamp and prize-winning vfadonna 

two new cars, is forging ahead. A day of prayer for needy students on Dec. 19, part of a nationwide prayer program imdcr the auspices of the National Federation of Cath­olic College Students, accented the impor­tant spiritual aspect of the program.

seph H. Albers, bishop of Lansing, and Most' 
Laetare Medal Is Formally Presented Rev. Francis J. Haas, bishop of Grand 
Rapids. 

to Frank C. Walker, '09, in New York At the conclusion of the ceremony Car­
Praise for his "work as a public ser\-ant during a most critical period of our national history" was accorded the Honorable Frank 
C. Walker, '09, former Postmaster General and presidential advisor, at the formal pres­entation on Jan. 4 of the 1948 Laetare Medal. 
Most Rev. John F. O'Hara, CS.C , bish­op of Buffalo, in reading the citation ac­companying the medal, paid tribute to Mr. Walker's work during "a period when our government had need of wise counsel and forthright decisions from patriotic and un­selfish statesmen." Mr. Walker, New York business and civic leader, received the medal at ceremonies in his New York City resi­dence. His Eminence Francis Cardinal Spell-man, of New York, represented the hier­archy of the Catholic Church and pinned the medal on Mr. Walker. 
"During twelve crucial years, whose na­tional and international currents and vicissi­tudes will be recorded in our annals as among the most hazardous of our histor>-, you were asked by the President of the United States to assume responsibilities of the gravest import to the safety and honor of our country, and the peace and securitj­of its people," Bishop O'Hara declared. "You took up those responsibilities in a spirit of humility and loyalty worthy of our most celebrated statesmen; and when the work was done, you retired from the glare of public life with almost inordinate eager­ness." 

Bishop O'Hara further declared that "the source and inspiration of this devoted serv­ice to your countr)' is your deep Catholic faith which you have lived in a spirit of humilitj- and childlike obedience." 
The bishop also lauded Mr. Walker's work as a director of the Catholic Charities of the .•\rchdioccsc of New York and pointed out that "at a time when the stability' of family life in our countr)' is threatened by a score of evils, you have been an ideal husband and father, rearing a family energized by Catho­lic faith, and made strong by the bonds of Christian love." 
In addition to Mr. Walker, Cardinal Spellman and Bishop O'Hara, others in at­tendance included Mrs. Frank C Walker; Thomas J. Walker, '42, a son, and Mrs. Walker; Mrs. Robert L. Ameno, a daughter; Mrs. J. J. McCarthy and Mrs. John W. Cot­ter, sisters; Mrs. Frank Boucher, Mrs. Walker's mother; and J. Arthur Haley, of Notre Dame.

Brother Patrick Cain, CS.C , '35, widely kno%vn among alumni as a professor, rector and prefect at Notre Dame, is the first di­rector of the new Boysville of Michigan at Macon, Mich., a "boarding school for boys with a problem," which was solemnly dedi­cated on Oct. 24. 
His Eminence, Edward Cardinal Mooney, archbishop of Detroit, blessed and dedicated Boys\'ille in the presence of Most Rev. Jo-

At the dedieafum eJLBoyarille were, left to right Brothei WiUiam Mong. CS.C. asaistant pto*ineiaL Cardinol Mooney and Brother Patrick. &S.C> achool director. 
dinal Mooney thanked all those who made Boysville possible: his fellow bishops of Michigan and other clergy; Henry Ford, H, president of the Ford Motor Co., who sold the land and the buildings on it for a fraction of their worth; Msgr. Carroll F. Deady, '34, superintendent of schools of the archdiocese of Detroit, who secured the NYA buildings for Boysville and who is supervising the planning and building of the school; the Knights of Columbus of Michigan, who will pay the running expenses; the Brighton Auxi­liary of Boysville who presented a check for ten thousand dollars; and the Brothers of Holy Cross, "men without whose consecrat­ed lives we could not set up this institution." 
Assisting Brother Patrick at Boysville are 
Brothers Alexander Buckley, Carlos Dolan 
and Rene Lcnhard. 
Boysville of Michigan is a unique Catholic school since it is a boarding school for high school boys "with a problem," whether the problem is one of loss of parents, need for sympathetic and expert guidance, or need for vocational skills. It is not a home for delinquent boys. Its students are Catholic boys of high school age from the five dio­ceses of Michigan. Its curriculum consists of Religion, English, social studies, mathemat­ics, science, wood, metal, and electrical shop work and auto mechanics. 
Present plans call eventually for about three hundred boys when the full four years of high school are in session. This year only freshmen were admitted, and each succeed­ing year another class will enter until the full four-year high school program is in op­eration. 

Some Special Thanks 
Now that the battle is quieted, snow covers the fifty-yard line and nobody wants anything (except basketball tickets), the ALUMKUS pauses to extend some special thanks to a couple of people who helped a lot of alumni during the year—Herb Jones, '27, and Bob Cahill, '34. We need hardly tell you that the former is business manager of athletics and the latter ticket manager. 
There were complaints of course, and still are. Not everybody got to sit in a sideline seat. Some alumni couldn't even get in. And lots of people couldn't bring their uncle and aunt or their best customers to the Northwestern game or the Southern Cali­fornia game or some other. 
But wc in the Alumni Office, from a van­tage point dose in, can say with authority that, for a couple of guys who have the toughest ticket-distribution job in the coun­try, year in and year out. Herb Jones and Bob Cahill come mighty close to perform­ing some near miracles, especially for their fellow alumni. Even with an alumni body that is growing by quick thousands—prob­ably some 1,400 will be added just in 1949 —thry'rc trying to.do better all the time. 
And so we give them our gratitude, and we know that we have a lot of support.

Ten Years 


for Twin City Auxiliary 
[The ALUMNUS is particularly happy to print this article, written by the Auxiliary members at the specific and urgent request of the Notre Dame Club of the Twin Cities. The article tells its own story of ten years of accomplishment in the MinneapolisSt. Paul area and is of course important on that account alone. But it is even more impor­tant in the way that it provides a model by which other Notre Dame groups can do in like manner. Happy anniversary!—Ed.] 
Nearly ten years ago, in April of 1939, a small group of the wives of the Twin Cities Notre Dame Club met at a luncheon at the Curtis Hotel, Minneapolis, for the purpose of organizing an auxiliary. This group consisted of the following: Mrs. Ar­thur K. Sullivan, Mrs. Edward Gushurst, Mrs. E. A. O'Brien, Mrs. Robert Madden, Mrs. Robert M. Tegeder, Mrs. Vincent Mauren, Mrs. Arnold J. Klein, Mrs. Walter 
D. HaU, Mrs. John D. Yelland, Mrs. Thom­as Frost, Mrs. John Doylt-and'Mrs. Frank Mayer. Mrs. Frost presided as chairman and Mrs. Doyle as secretary. 
The first meeting was held the following month at the home of Mrs. Frost, with Mrs. Yelland serving as joint hostess. It was then decided that meetings would be held month­ly at the homes of the members, two host­esses to serve at each meeting. Coffee and dessert would be served upon arrival of the members after which the business meeting would follow. Bridge would then be played by those desiring to do so, each player to pay a certain amount into the "kitty" to be divided among the winners. 
The first officers elected by the group were: Mrs. Thomas Frost, president; Mrs. John D. Yelland, Minneapolis vice-presi­dent; Mrs. Frank Mayer, St. Paul vice-president; Mrs. Vincent Mauren, secretary-treasurer. Mrs. Arthur K. Sullivan was named publicity chairman for St. Paul and Mrs. Yelland as publicity chairman for Min­neapolis. Mrs. Frost later that year moved to Cedar Rapids, la., and Mrs. Yelland assum­ed her duties as president for the remainder of the first term. 
The following have served as presidents of the Auxiliary during the ensuing years: Mrs. Louis Regan, 1940; Mrs.' Arthur K. 
The first joint afTair between the Auxili­ary and the Twin Cities Notre Dame Club was a picnic supper in September, 1939. Many joint dances, dinners and parties have followed through the years all of which have been well attended and greatly enjoyed. A-dinner was given on Nov. 13 of this year at the Fort Snelling Officers Club. 
On Dec. 5 the Auxiliary and their fami­lies joined the Alumni at the Annual Notre Dame Mass and Communion at St. Thomas College Chapel in St. Paul. A breakfast fol­lowed at the Cafeteria on the campus. The Alumni and Auxiliary plan to make this an annual "family affair." 
On their first Christmas the Auxiliary ini­tiated the practice of caring for a needy family by suppling a complete Christmas dinner, Christmas tree, toys, clothing and canned goods. All of these articles are brought to the December meeting and the committee in charge sees to it that they arc delivered to the needy family. The Catholic Charities in both St. Paul and Minneapolis usually furnish the names of the families, their ages and sizes. 
The Auxiliary also maintains a yearly membership in the Catholic Charities and receives many spiritual benefits therefrom. 
During the year 1943, due to gas ration­ing, some meetings were held at the Knights of Columbus Club Rooms in Minneapolis on Saturday afternoons. Luncheon was served and after the business meeting bridge was played. The Auxiliary also had Masses for Peace offered during the War. 
offerid^ at time of death of members or their immediate families. 
The Auxiliary functions primarily as a so­cial group. A luncheon has been held an­nually in the spring of the year ever since its organization. At that time the nominat­ing committee annoimces the new officers for the coming year. The meetings arc dis­continued during the summer' months. At the next annual luncheon the Auxiliary will celebrate its tenth anniversary and special plans are being made to conmiemorate the 
.first decade of its activities. The membership has changed consider­ably during these past ten years—some mem­bers resigning due to change of residence to other cities, etc., and many new members have joined, until at the present time the roster comprises 40 active members. Three hostesses are now named for each meeting which are still held in the different homes on the second Monday of each month.

ATHLETICS • • 
Basketball 
A veteran Notre Dame basketball team 

got off to a good start in the 1948-49 cam­
paign by copping five out its first seven 
games in a rugged 24-game schedule. 
The Irish forced Illinois, one of the top 

contenders for the Big Nine championship, 
into overtime before the Illini emerged \-ic­

torious, 59 to 58, in the season opener in 
the Notre Dame G>in. The Notre Dame five 
won five consecutive games after this slim 
defeat before going down before Indiana, 
50-47. 
In the second game of the season. Coach Ed Krause's team journeyed to Chicago and with the reser\-es playing most of the sec­ond half emerged victorious over North­western, 55 to 44. Playing their third con­secutive game against Big Nine opposition, the Irish came home to trim Wisconsin, 60 to 54, to run their string of victories to two. 
The Krausemen overwhelmed the Uni­versity of Pennsylvania, in their final home game before the Christmas holidays, and then returiied to. Chicago Stadium to over­power Navy, 70 to 62, in another game fea­tured by the use of .reser\-es by Coach Krause. 
There was no rest for the Irish quintet during the Christmas holidays, because of participation on Dec. 27 and 28 in the Big Four holiday double header program at In­dianapolis. Notre Dame came from far be­hind to defeat Purdue, 51 to 50, on a free throw by Leo Bamhorst in the last ten seconds in the opening night of play. In the second night of the program in mammoth Butler fieldhouse, the Irish lost a thriller to Indiana by three points. Following the double header program, the team embarked on a long trip to face Southern Methodist in Dallas, Tex., and St. Mar\-'s in San Fran­cisco. 
The toughest part of the Notre Dame schedule remains for the January- and Feb­ruary portion of the card. The Irish have to face DePaul twice, Butler twice, Denver, Kentucky, Michigan State twice, Marquette twice, St. Louis twice, Canisius, New York University and Northwestern. 
The starting lineup for the Notre Dame cagers in early season games featured the same five starters from last year's team, which won 17 while losing 7. Leo Bam­horst and Jim O'Halloran have been the starting forwards, with John Brennan at center and Paul Gordon and KeWn O'Shea at guards. Leading reser\-es have been letter­men John Foley and Dick Kluck and sopho­more Dick Giedlin. 
O'Shea, two-time All-American, has av­eraged 15 points per game in the early games to lead Notre Dame individual scorers, followed closely by Brennan and Barnhorst. 
Cross Country 
Coach Elvin R. (Doc) Handy guided his 1948 Notre Dame cross-country team to a highly-successful season which was marred by only one defeat in duel competition. 
The Irish harriers romped to Wctory over a strong Wyoming team. Navy, Villanova and Iowa, and walked off with top honors in the Central Collegiate meet. The only duel defeat of the season was suffered at the hands of distance star Don Gehrmann and his University of Wisconsin teammates. 
Indiana's Hoosier's dethroned the Notre Dame runners in the Indiana State meet held at Notre Dame, but the Irish wound up the campaign with a creditable showing of fifth place in the NC.A.^ meet at East Lansing, Mich. 
Shouldering the burden for the harriers during the 1948 season were Jim Murphy, Bill Leonard, Jim Kittell, Lou Tracy, Tony DaDamio, Lou Lepry and Gerry Johnson. 


Football 
Coach Frank Leahy guided his 1948 No­tre Dame football team to his third succes­sive undefeated season—but the Irish did not receive the "national championship" award. 
The powerful Notre Dame eleven, which held down first place in the Associated Press Poll to determine the national cham­pion only once since the early weeks of the season, finished in second place in the final poll of the season behind the perennially strong Michigan Wolverines. 
And thusly, the Notre Dame Monogram Club will journey to Michigan in the near future to present the J. Hugh O'Donnell Memorial Trophy, symbolic of the national collegiate title, to the Wolverines. The J. Hugh O'Donnell Trophy was established by the Notre Dame Monogram Club after the 1947 Irish eleven permanently retired the trophy sponsored by the University of Min­nesota "M" Club. A team must win the title three times in order to retire the trophy, and then that school is obligated to establish a trophy in its place. 
True, the Irish were tied in the final game of the season against Southern Cali­fornia in the Los Angeles Coliseum. But they got up off the floor like true champions in the closing minutes of this traditional con­test against the Trojans to avert apparently certain defeat. And again in the final sec­onds of the game, one final long pass almost hit Jim Martin for the winning touchdown, but it was batted down as Martin waited to take it near the USC goal line. 
Frank Tripucka, brilliant successor to Johnny Lujack at quarterback for Notre Dame, suffered six fractured vertebrae in the

spine on the final play of the first half and sophomore Bob Williams gave an excellent account of himself in guiding the Irish dur­ing the second half against the Trojans. Tri­pucka, after spending more than a week in a Los Angeles hospital, was flown back to Notre Dame and was able to proceed to his home for the Christmas holidays. 
Perhaps the nicest things about the game 
came during Tripucka's stay in the Los An­
geles hospital. Members of the Southern Cal­
ifornia team made it a point to visit Frank 
during his confinement and presented him 
a football autographed by the Trojans and 
a Southern California monogrammed blan­
ket. 
Before the Southern California game, the 
Irish were hard pressed only twice during 
the season. The first time was against the 
Purdue Boilermakers in the opening game 
of the season in which, all sports fans will 
remember, Notre Dame staved off a late 
Purdue rally to gain a 28 to 27 decision. 
And the second time was against Northwes­
tern, but here again the Irish came back 
to gain a 12 to 7 triumph. 
Coach Leahy used his reserves generously as the Notre Dame eleven defeated Pitts­burgh, 40 to 0; Michigan State, 26 to 7; Nebraska, 44 to 13; Iowa, 27 to 12; Navy, 41 to 7; Indiana, 42 to 6, and Washington, 46 to 0, in the remaining seven games of the ten-game schedule.

The Natural Law Institute 
(Continued from Page 4) 
natural law. The one is chiefly represented by Cicero, the great orator, toward the end of the Roman republic. The other is con­nected with the work of the classical jurists who in the first three centuries of the Ro­man empire built up a system of private law which was to exercise a unique influence in legal histor>'. Cicero, guided by Greek philosophy, depicts the law of nature as the eternal and universal law originating in God and therefore not subject to man-made changes. Its fundamental precepts are: to harm no one and to ser\-e the common wel­fare. 
"The Roman jurists on the other hand, were primarily concerned with the law bind­ing on earth and enforceable by court ac­tion. To their minds what squared with the normal order of human interests was natural and, consequently, did not require further evndence. They assumed such rules to be familiar to all peoples and applicable to citi­zens and non-citizens alike. But not all rules practiced in that general way were regarded as in conformit)' with nature. A slave, e.g., while at law a piece of propert>-, was by nature a person, and all men were equal. This antithesis caused the jurists to make concessions to the point of view of natural law. Since, however, they took slavery for granted, these concessions were limited in scope. Outside the field of practical consid­erations they referred to natural law only in sporadic statements. But these statements were given a prominent place in the Corpus Juris of Justinian. So they could be used as outstanding evidence for the recognition of a law of nature. In fact, they have been quoted throughout the centuries, from the Middle Ages to the present day." 
Thomas Aquinas Leads 
"After the seventh century there was for several hundred years little discussion in the field of jurisprudence," explained Dr. Ger­ould, "since Europe was then so bus>- with immediate problems of reorganization and recovery that abstract questions had to be postponed. The Decretum of Gratian, com­piled shortly before 1150 at Bologna, mark­ed the beginning of renewed inquiry into the principles of justice. Gratian's insistence on natural law as basic but subser\-ient to di­vine law won complete acceptance, though his successors long debated the seeming par­adox involved in the theory. 

"Meanwhile the courtier-scholar John of Salisbury had made an independent defini­tion of natural law as a factor in govern­ment. The primacy of the law of nature and the place it held in the divine order were at length established and explained by the schoolmen of the thirteenth century, most satisfactorily of all by St. Thomas Aquinas. His conclusions were not thereafter disputed, and subsequent discussion till the end of the Middle Ages, was chiefly in the field of po­litical theory..The treatises of Sir John For­tcscue illustrate to advantage how natural law was viewed by a great jurist.'of the fifteenth century." 
From Dr. Romraen came the significant statement that "a rich development of the Philosophy of Natural Law and of practical applications of its principles to concrete his­torical situations is the mark of the decades from 1500 to 1650; these decades are mark­ed by the Renaissance, the Reformation and —^most important in the history of Nat­ural Law—^by the second flowering of Scho­lasticism which spread from the Universities of the Iberian Peninsula all over Christian­ity. The few philosophers of the Renaissance period in the strict sense are of less impor­tance, since they merely repeated what Ci­cero and their beloved stoic philosophers had taught. Also the Reformers did not only not contribute an>thing important to the Natural Law doctrine, but, on the contrary, they substituted, under the influence of their theolog>' which made the idea of Natural Law ultimately inconceivable, the biblical and evangelical 'law' for the Natural Law. 
Doctors Make Great Contributions 
"It was the great doctors of the second flowering of Scholasticism who made the truly great contributions to the theory of Natural Law, men like Vittoria, Soto, Vas­quez, Suarez, Molina, Bellarmine, Mariana. In their great volumes De Legibus and De justitia et de jure they gave much more than a mere commentary of the (hiaestionts 90 and following of the Prima Secundae of the Summa of St. Thomas; they gave a comprehensive philosophy of Law of the lex aeterna, the lex naturalis and the lex hu­mana. And they were eager to refine and clarify the doctrine of Natural Law as against its distortion by the School of Oc­cam, against its depreciation by the super­naturalism by the Reformers, against its idealogization by Machiavelli." 

"The world's only hope for peace and security rests in a wider application of the Natural Law—the law of God recognized by human reason," Judge Wilkin said at the closing session of the Institute. 
Oiur Materialistic Attitude 

Judge Wilkin stated bluntly that "the crit­ical problems of our national life today stem directly from a materialistic and positivist attitude toward life and law" which ignores the Natural Law. This attitude, he added has resulted in disrespect for our courts and judicial processes, with the corresponding neglect of the common interest and public welfare of the American people, 
"It is one of the great tragedies of human histor)','' Judge Wilkin said, "that when the United States came to its apex of power and exerted a force and influence which no other nation had ever possessed, it deserted the basic Natural Law philosophy of its Found­ing Fathers, abandoned the principles upon which its legal institutions were built, and insisted not on constitutionalism and the rule of law, but on the veto power for the asser­tion of arbitrary will. In demanding the right of veto it abandoned the states that represented our ideals of govenmient and united with the U.S.S.R., which is the very antithesis of our form of government and our s>'stem of jurisprudence."

SPOTLIGHT ALUMNI 
FRANK J. STARZEL, '25, New York City, has been appointed general manager of the Associated Press. 
Born in Iowa, where his father published the semi-weekly LeMars Globe-Post, Mr. Starzel was at Notre Dame in 1921-22, leav­ing to enter newspaper work. After working on papers in Iowa City, Des Moines, Bloom­ington. 111., and Chicago, he joined the As­sociated Press in 1929. Since then he has had broad experience in all branches of AP operations, becoming assistant general man­ager in 1943. 
WALTER TROHAN, '26, will on Jan. 20 become chief of the Washington Bureau of the Chicago Tribune, succeeding the vet­eran Arthur Sears Henning. 
Mr. Trohan's latest promotion follows a steady rise wt h the Chicago Tribune since he joined it in February, 1929. He worked 
on general assignments in Chicago until Oc­tober, 1934, when he was transferred to the ' paper's Washington Bureau. He has remain­ed there ever since except for a period in 1946 when he was transferred temporarily to New York City to cover the early sessions of the United Nations at Lake Success. 
Traveling widely in the United States and through Europe and South America, Mr. Trohan has covered for his paper innumer­able assignments of international import. As a member of the working press he frequently accompanied the late President Roosevelt. 
A prolific writer, Mr. Trohan has found time to "ghost" books (including Jim Far­ley's memoirs) and contribute magazine ar­ticles. He was named in 1948 executive director of the Chicago Tribune's Washing­ton Bureau. In December, 1948, he was chosen as winner of a Edward Scott Beck Foundation award for the best domestic news story published in the Tribune during the year. The prize-winning story had to do with the plans of President Truman to send Chief Justice Vinson on special mis­sion to Premier Stalin in Moscow. He won the same award in 1945 for his stories on the Pearl Harbor investigation. 
Mr. Trohan is the father of two daughters and a son.

Mr. Fester shows a film to admiring Brother Bobert CS.C. 
"What's new on the campus?" 

That's a frequent question. And, right now, one good answer would be: "The Au­dio-Visjial Department." 
Begun as a special project early in 1948 by Father Howard Kenna, CS.C, director of studies, the A-V Department, under the direction of Orville Foster, M.A., '44, start­ed its real operations during the subsequent summer session when two classes in audio­visual education were taught by Mr. Foster. 
Says Mr. Foster: "The Audio-Visual Cen­ter at Notre Dame has made only a begin­ning in its work. At a forum discussion held last summer at the University, a panel of prominent men in the audio-visual field agreed that Notre Dame had assumed lead­ership in Catholic audio-^^ual education. Now from this start it is the aim of the de­partment to develop its film and record li­brary until it can ultimately supply Catho­lic universities, colleges, high schools and elementary schools on a regional, possibly national, scale." 
For the present, the A-V Center has to confine its activities to'taking care of, and especially coordinating Notre Dame's own vital needs.

A Character Comes Back 
Col. Hoynes 
of 


Notre Dame 

Another famous Notre Dame character has been brought back to life in a new book published by the Ave Maria Press. He is Colonel Hoynes of Notre Dame*, by the Rev. Thomas A. Lahey, C.S.C., associate editor of The Ave Maria, well known author of books, and writer of the weekly column, "Bits Out of Life" in The Ave Maria. Father Lahey has recaptured the man who was dean of the College of Law from 1883 to 1918, then dean-emeritus until his death in 1933. 
The life-time work of William Hoynes in the field of legal education is only one facet of his versatality for he also distinguished himself as a lawyer, a soldier in the Civil War, a public servant, a journalist and edi­tor, and an outstanding Catholic layman. Alumni of Notre Dame and those who worked with him on the faculty remember the "Colonel," as he was affectionately call­ed, best for his innocent human foibles which endeared him to the University and made him one of the most lovable "char­acters" of his period. As a former fellow fac­ulty member of Colonel Hoynes, Father La­hey has been able to recreate some of the more amusing incidents of the Colonel's life, and to recount his achievements. 
An insight into the grand personality of the Colonel is given in Father Lahey's de­scription of him as a gentleman of the old school who always fitted his wardrobe to the situation. For all patriotic celebrations. Colonel Hoynes wore his army uniform and campaign hat; for legal appearances, his cravat and Ascot tie; and for student gath­erings, his famous top hat and long coat. 
Not all the Colonel's habits provoked laughter for, with all his idiocyncracies, he was respected and loved by his students for his patience and kindness to them in their scholastic work. Long after graduation many of his most successful students called upon him for legal advice, which he gave with­out stint until his death. 
Along with his comprehensive and pene­trating grasp of law, the Colonel possessed that "divine spark" to send students forth eager with the enthusiasm of their calling. 
Writes an old graduate, "Time and again when any of them got into trouble, he would intercede wholeheartedly with the President of the University or the disciplin­ary authorities. Needless to say the law stu­dents were very loyal to him in return, in spite of their occasional frivolity. They all loved him with the affection of a son for his father." 
Nor were his civic accomplishments a small part of his life of service. Alternating between journalism and law before return­ing to his alma mater to teach. Colonel Hoynes held various important positions with newspapers, one, as editor of the Peoria Transcript. Finally, his legal interests drew him from the field of journalism into law. In rapid succession, he was admitted to practice in the Supreme Court of Michgan, the United States Circuit Court, the Su­preme Court of Illinois, and the Supreme Court of the United States. In 1883 he re­turned to Notre Dame as professor, and shortly afterwards, as dean of the College of Law. 
At the threat of World War I, President Wilson called Colonel Hoynes to Washing­ton as an advisor on international law. At that period, he also contributed articles to leading publications on the need of avoid­ing foreign entanglements. Although nomi­nated by the Indiana Republicans for the House of Representatives, he lost in a heat­ed campaign. Often he served on state com­missions. Once he served on a Commission appointed by the President, and surprised Washington by returning a large part of the budget allotted him. 
Because of his outstanding service to the Catholic Church, Pope Pius X in 1912 made Colonel Hoynes a member of the Order of St. Gregory. In recognition for his work, the University in 1919 dedicated the Hoynes College of Law to him. It remained tmtil the present law building was built in 1931. 
From 1918 until his death, the Colonel retired from active service at Notre Dame although he continued his interest -in the University and in his former students, his "boys" as he called them. Father Lahey re­calls vividly the last scene of the Colonel which remains in his memory. He sat in his room with an immense magnifying glass, through which he tried to make out with his one almost blind eye the briefs of a for­mer student. The man who was bom in Kil­kenny, Ireland, died in 1933 at the age of 87. 
In his funeral sermon. Father John Cava­naugh epitomized the qualities of the Colonel: "Every great historic campus is sure to have its picturesque figures, its quaint characters—and the Colonel was such a one. No man surpassed him in substan­tial wisdom, in sobriety of judgment, in hard practical conmion sense. But what made him especially beloved were the simplicity, the amiability, the pleasant cheering vivacity that clung like vines around his giant strength and power."

After Mass, dub members and their wi\-cs went to the Knights of Columbus home in Munde for breakfast. This became a pleasant prolonged session lasting from 10 a. m. to 1 p. m. Of course the Southern Cal game was well repla^-ed. BILL CRONIN said that it was the largest assemblage of N.D. alumni he had ever seen at which only coffee was ser\"ed.

'Last Sept. 13, King's College, in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., began its third year of operation. Under the direction of the priests of the Congregation of Holy Cross, the college, more formally titled College of Christ the King, has, in three years, increased its en­rollment from an initial 350 to a present 621. 
Plans for the college began when His Ex­cellency William J. Hafey, D.D., Bishop of the Diocese of Scranton, invited the priests of the Congregation to establish the school in Wilkes-Barre, which is the cultural and shopping center of some 300,000 residents of Wyoming Valley. Appointed first presi­dent of the college. Rev. James W. Conner-ton, '20, assumed his duties on Dec. 15, 1945. 
During the first two years all classes and administrative activities were conducted in the former Wilkes-Barre Business College, a three-story building only a block from the center of the city. The building was set up to include eight classrooms and chemical and biology laboratories and had an audi­torium which seated 500. 
In January of this year work was begun on a student union building adjacent to the main building. Returning students this fall saw the completed two-stor>' structure which contained five classrooms on the sec­ond floor and a student lounge and cafe­teria below. 
The teaching staff now numbers about 40, half of whom are Notre Dame graduates. In addition to Father Conncrton, there are Rev. William S. Scandlon, '30, vice-presi­dent, and Rev. John J. Lane, '30, former assistant director of studies at Notre Dame, who is the new dean. 
Of the other faculty members who remain at King's, the following came to Wilkes-Barre when the college opened in 1946. Rev. Ra>-mond J. Clancy, '29; Rev. John M. Du­puis, '31; Rev. James E. Kline, '22; Dr. John H. A. Whitman, '25; Tom Brock, '42. 
Last year the faculty was increased by the addition of Rev. Leo W. Gorman, '26; Rev. Thomas J. Lane, '29; Bob McCabe, '36, and Michael E. O'Donoghue, '32. This year the following teachers joined the fac­ulty: Rev. Aloysius E. Cussen, '48; Adam 
M. Drayer, '35; Edward B. Kunkle, '43; Rev. E. Henrv Malone, '42; Rev. Peter F. Mueller, '37;'Rev. Lloyd W. Teske, '33; James F. Welter, '48. 
The athletic facilities at King's consist of a gymnasium seating more than 500, where the home basketball games are played. Last. spring the first annual Catholic High School Invitational basketball tournament was held in the gym. Also at Vaughn's Comers across the river from Wilkes-Barre is the new foot­ball field which this year was dedicated on Oct. 18 as King's won its second game in three starts. 
Next year the college will have a complete four-year curriculum, with major sequences leading to the degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science being offered.

Therefore, please announce in the ALUMNUS that I am forced to extend my offer for an additional month.

From a bedraggled, worn, and weary Sec . . . what random joltings from the cull that could be gathered in football tra\'cls. . . . 
FRITZ WILSON, a haberdasher who may one day be president, too, is still a leader in N.D. activities in Pittsburgh, BILL HALLORAN, his attractive wife and one of his five children, were met in the Chi­cago Airport—between planes; Bill's with Sears-Roe­buck in sales promotion. Bill informed me one of his sons is playing football at Fenwick High these days .. . and also told me JACK HICOK is now in Boston, Mass., with R. H. White and Co. .. . has been for the past two years. Jack manages that firm's electric appliance department. Also, Hal­loran relays the information that DAN MOORE has been promoted by Western Electric and is now firing in St. Paul, Minn., where W-E has built a new plant, with Dan in charge of employee relations.

He was heading for an engagement with JIMMY QUINN, Rahway. N. J.. bookmaker—REAL books, not THAT kind!—but I had to scoot back to Chicago and missed meeting Jimmy. 
JOE M.AXWELL met up with in New York: now labor-relations director for four-thousand employee Phtico refrigeration plant in Philadelphia, he was ac­tive at his hobby—scouting the Giants and Cards for the Bear5. Had a pleasant dinner with Maxey, cut­ting up some touches about you gu)^. 
There are many others—but, bo>-s, you'll have to write-it-out for me, I expect: these da>*s, it*s tough to remember where I live, let alone who I meet beating fast trails across the country-. My apolo­gies for those overlooked . . . and, drop a line to the old scrivener with the information: eventually, it'll end up here, where it says . . . THIS IS JMB .. . the '27 BROADCASTING SYSTEM!

'•TURK MEINERT and JOHN POLISKY were at the Htt game. 
"Wallace, Frederick and myseU had to look twice, but there he was, none other than FRED COL­LINS. He is in Chicago and that is all I could find out.

Joseph A. McCabe, Rosary College, River Forest, 111. 
From JOE McCABE: Your corresponding secretary still wishes he could get p list of names in this column long enough to correspond with those in some of the other class write-ups. How about it—is there a 3-cent stamp in the house? Specifically, your house? Looks as though the undersigned would have to name Miclugan as the No. 1 grid team to get any rise out of the au­dience . . . and that's too steep a price. Kidding aside, let's have any new*s or rumors about your­selves, your job, or other NDs. Don't worrj* about whether or not the names mentioned are on the '33 list—we're glad to get any neu? about any Notre Dame man. 
Front-and'centert the '33 spotlight for this issue falls on the following:—SXEVE BANAS lives in Ebenezer, N. Y., and has a restaurant there—one way of making sure you get enough to eat! .. . JOHN LIBERTI telephoned the undersigned but I was away on \-acation, and have no news concern­ing him to pass along—ivhat gives, John? Still live in Batawa? Droo us a line and we'll pass the word along. . . . LEO HODEL and NORDY HOFF­MANN ate neighbors on Chicago's South Side. . . . JIM O'SHAUGHNESSY, PAT CROWLEY and ED STEPHAN still going strong in Catholic Acdon work in Chicago. . . . We'd very much like to hear of other Notre Dame men carr)ing the ball for CA, by the way. 
Another phone call came for us while we were on vacation—this one from JACK BREEN of De­troit. Ever a card, Jack startled the Kodak phone gal out of six chews of bubble gum by announcing that "Governor Den-ey's office is calling." . . . Another call Dewey ch'dn't get, yak, yak. . . .JIM UPRTTCHARD continues to keep the Bell Tele­phone S)^em jangling merrily in Cleveland. 
Heard also from JACK COLEMAN, '44, who took time from commuting between New York and Cleveland in the interests of the Coleman-Pettersen Corporation to say that he reads the *33 column. Thanks, Jack. 
Perhaps the most rewarding letter of all, though, was from another '44er —J . PHILIP CLARKE, now a lieutenant (jg) in the Navy Medical Corps, stationed at San Diego, Calif. He was kind enough to give us a pat on the back for our plug for the devotion of attending Mass and receiving Commu­nion on First Sattu^ys of the month—and offering the benefits thereof to the Blessed Mother, with no strings attached. There have been a couple of First Saturdays since then . . . anybody make 'em? This station gives no guarantee as to the temporal re­wartls arising from the First Saturdays devoU'on, but we seem to recall saying that Our Lady might lend a hand in the Purdue game. . . . 
In conclusion, we would like it noted that this is one column that did not pick Dewey. How about some letters.'

From HOCH: 
It has been a long time since we have had enough material to go to press with a column. In the months past, however, your scrilM has read with interest the notes appearing in the '33 column which was printed up directly by the Alumni Office. 
If we remember correctly, our last stint dates back to balmy summer weather. Since that time we have had two letters—one from TOM PROCTOR and the other from WADE KELLEHER. 
First, Tom in New York City: 
"I beliew my secretary sent you a formal notice of my new assodation but I think you are entitled to a little further discussion of this assodadon. 
"As you know, I ha\-e been itching to return to the general practice of law for some time and was growing rather weary of being a corporation legal serx'ant. I was seriously contemplating a return to my practice in Elkhart, Ind., since I am still a member of that firm, when Governor McNutt offered me an association with his firm which has been in existence for about a year and one half since his last return from the Phillippines as first ambassador thereto. . . . 
"I have thought something of coming to Balti­more for the Notre Dame-Navy game but since I am now working practically e\-ery Saturday and sometimes Sundays I had better not plan any such trip. .. . I was glad to learn that MITCHELL SALEH has finally taken the plunge." 
And from Wade in Chicago: 
"After 13 years I finally found free stationery, envelopes, and stamps. Please excuse a few >-ears' delay, I do see BUSS BREEN cvciy so often walk­ing on LaSalle St.; seems to spend his time going in and out of the banks. GEORGE DEMETRIO has his own cafe now, called the Hoosier Room, and because he is now one ahead of me in the younger generation he is hard to handle. All I can get out of him is a free cup of cold coffee, so I can't vouch for the food. 
"Ran into BOB PRENDERGAST at the Notre Dame-Northwestern game. Also had a very nice visit with DEAN McCARTHY. I am still in the transportation business with my father; you can always get hold of me at Kelleher Motor Freight Lines, Chicago office, I3th and Clark." 
Thanks, Wade! Let's not wait 13 more >'ears for another.

WHEN JOHNS-MANVILLE on Oct. 7 open­ed a new plant in Tihon, N. H., for the manufacture of Quinterra, a new electrical insulation, Robert G. Quinn, Ch.E., '23, was in the spotlight. The new product, named for him, had been produced after eight years of effort by a Johns-Manville research group under Mr. Quinn's direction. 
One of the limiting factors in electrical progress has been heat failure in electrical machines. As one of the "wizards" of elec­tricity. Dr. C. P. Steinmetz, pointed out, that "the life of an electrical apparatus dc­X>ends on the life of its insulation. Nearly all failures of electrical machines are heat failures." 
Because of the company's interest in as­bestos and experience in heat control the Johns-Manville research laboratory was ask­ed to find an answer to this insulation prob­lem. And, under Mr. Quinn's direction, it did. Trial runs of Quinterra were started five years ago and exhaustive tests have been carried out with the cooperation of the American Steel and Wire Co., General Cable Co. and General Electric Co. The product' withstood heat over a wide range of working temperatures, without deterioration. 
Through Quinterra, more powerful elec­trical equipment with a longer life span, more compactly designed, is made possible. 
Early in October we rccci\'ed the formal announce­ment of Tom's association with the firm of Paul 
V. McNutt. Not only were we duly impressed but we felt a distinct honor had come to the Cla^ of '35 through its president. Much congratulations, Prexy! 
PAUL GUARNIERI and wife have produced a Junior! Paul -Arthur showed up on the 5th of Sep­temi>er. Congratulations to you and the Kfrs., Paul, on your future quarterback. 
As usual we are kept up to date on the *35ei3 in the Panamanian Delegadon through our friend JOE HARRINGTON. Joe recently sent us a clipping 
3S 

which stated that JOHN PETTENGILL manied Mn. Evelyn Fenton in St. Agnes' Chapel in Wash­ington, D. C, on Nov. 2. The bride is one of the staff of the Custom Section of the Canal Zone Air Depot. John, as you know, is assistant director of physical education and recreation of tlie Schoab Division and resides in Balboa. Congratulations, John! 
The Notre Dame Club of Baltimore, under the leadership of DR. ROY SCHOLZ, our presidentt decided to bnDg a little bit of "ye ole N. D. spirit" to Baltimore for the Navy game. Two large affairs were held over the week-end—a rally atteodeid by nearly 1,000 people in the ballroom of the Lord Baltimore Hotel the night before the game and a cocktail party in the ballroom of the Emerson Hotd immediately after the game. You vnU be able to read sometime of the affairs in the Baltimore Chib column. The week*end drew its share of *35er3. Among them FRANK HOLAHAN, NED ROWAN, FRED BROOKMEYER, TOM FLYNN. JOE BUC­CI, LOUIS GROSSO, AL LORTTSCH, and AD­RIEN WACKERMAN. We saw most of these at the rally or cocktail party or they were reported to us by Roy. No doubt many more '35ers were here but we missed them. 
JOE WASHKO wrote us a letter in September from Akron, O., askii^; if he could obtain game tickets through the Baltimore club. Sincx we were not able to help him—we gather Joe did not come east. For that we are very sorry. 
Several of the gai^ sent tickets just prior to the game, requesting us to dispose of them. Had every-­one come who had planned to do so originally, we would have had a fair-sized *35 reunion. 
The word reunion brings up a date we all have with each other in 1950. The Class of *35 is ageing and will celebrate in 1950, its 15th anniversary. 
How about some suggestions regarding the kind of program you would like at that time. It's not too early to begin thinking about our reunion. We'd appredate nominations for the job of chairman. It would be well to elect someone in or near South Bend so that he could be in relativdy close contact with the Alumni Office. Let's start talking up the reunion so that by 1950 it will be runniikg in. hi ^ gear for a record breakii^ turnout. Remember %ire missed the 10-Year Reunion in '45, so we have to make up for lost time in '50.

From HAL WILLLAMS: 

The top spot this issue goes to BURNIE "SWEDE" BAUER, Box 65, Granger, Ind., who writes the following on blue stationer^-: 
"Just returned from the Oliver Hotel where the lads of '38 are still leading the Northwestern \-ictor>­<xlebration. Thought I would report on those with whom I pressed palms before my memorj- failed. l.awyer ED M.\NN, of the U. S. .\nti-Trust De­partment in Cbtcaga—whom I last saw in 1940— called me in from Family Acres, the name of our homestead. After talking with him I saw WALT MONACELLI, a lawyer concerned with patents in 1 beUex-e, Pittsburgh . . . then Lawyer JACK M.\­HOXEY who has just started a general practice in Ripon, Wis. . . . then lawyer LOU ANDERSON and his charming wife, of South Bend. Lou, in addition to practicing, teaches business law at Notre Dame. I was beginning to think only lawyers at­tended Notre Dame games when I saw OWEN K.\NE and JIM CARSON .. . or is Jim a lawyer, too? Jim saj^ he has just taken up residence in his home town of Indianapolis after moving around the country. Also saw PAT C^REY. Heard BUB CROWXEY was there. J.ACK ANTON argued for Svc minutes with me about whether I saw him in a Wisconsin village resuurant five years ago. No decision. I think I saw BOB BODIE in a corner booth. 
"I sat next to NELSON VOGEL at the South Bend Serra Club recently. He told me that DON FISHER is studying for his master's degree at school w-hile selling insurance. "CELLY" BALL welcomed his first daughter in October; he has five boys. By the ways the fourth little Bauer arrived last June 28, making our score three girls and one boy. 
"I am still editing a monthly employee magazine for U. S. Rubber. On the side I am busily engaged in Catholic Action work. I organized the Christian Family Couples Movement here a year and a half ago and recently was elected the first president of the South Bend-Mishawaka CFM Federau'on. The purpose of the club is to have neighboring Catholic couples mMt regularly, discuss their common prob­lems in raising a Christian family in their locality and to organize services where needed. The organi­zation has spread to such cities as Chicago and Milwaukee.'* 
On Dec 5 I received a card from Mr. and Mrs. HAL LANGTON announcing the birth of a boy, James Patrick, on Nov. 14. Weight 7 pounds, 6 ounces. Dorothea Langton added the following, "We now Iia\-e four boys. Who is leading in the class of '38? Hal had a fairly successful football season but is hoping for better results in 1949. Basketball season is now on and he opened with a wtory. Hal wants lo be rememberd to all his classmates, especially his track buddies. Anytime there are any Notre Dame boys tra\-eliag near by always remember that the welcome mat is always out at the Langtons." Their address is 1433 W. 18th St., Lorain, O. 
I saw Dorotbea, a Baltimore girl, at the Notre Dame Club of Baltimore's cocktail party which

FRANK H . BOOS, of Detroit, preparatory 

student and college student at Notre Dame 
in 1908-12, was on Oct. 1 elected the four­
teenth president of the State Bar of Mich­
igan. 
.•\fter he left Notre Dame, Mr. Boos fin­ished his law course at the Detroit College of Law, was admitted to the bar in 1915 and in 1916 became a member of the legal firm of Faust, Miller and Boos. He served overseas in World War I as a sergeant and commissioned officer and after the war re­sumed his law practice in Detroit. He is now a member of the prominent firm of Baldwin and Boos, with offices at 2156 Pen­obscot Building. 
Active in the Detroit Bar Association, Mr. Boos was president of that organization in 1941-42. He was elected to the Board of Commissioners of the State Bar in 1943, became secretary of the State Bar in 1945 and in succeeding years, second and first vice-president.

At the club's pep tally at the Lord Baltimore Hotel the night before the game I saw FATHER TON'Y GOMEZ and CHICK G.ALL.AGHER. That night we were also honored to have BILL DOOLEY, FRAN'K LEAHY, HERB JONES, the REV. THEO­DORE HEEBURGH, C.S.C., BOB CAHILL, BER­NIE CIU.MMINS, HUGH BURNS, etc 
JOE HARRINGTON, of the Notre Dame Club of Panama, sent along a clipping from the Panama America of Nov. 14, 1948, which carried a story on WILLLAM J. SHERIDAN, who is now the assistant district attorney in the Canal Zone. 
In the past issue I reported that a letter from RUSS HUNT <412 Providence St., Woonsocket, R. I.) was stuck in the back part of my desk, I had 
The Notre Dame Alumnus 

to tear part of the desk apart, but I finally got the letter. Russ says, in part, "After spending five and a half years with the local chamber of commerce I left that post in August to take a job as sales representa­ti%*e for Brown and Bigelow, advertising specialists. I used to see DAN KEEFE quite frequently, but ha\-en't beard from him since he took off for Chi­cago to be best man at ZANNY GOLDMAN'S wedding in July. Numerous postcards mailed along the way told me that he visited with several N.D. bo>3 between here and Oshkosh. Wis., where he spent some time with BABE LeROY." 
Well, that's it, my lads. It's better than the past issue, but it could be better. More letters, please!

Robert G. Sanford 1103 E. Kensington Blvd, Shorewood, Wis. 
From MARY LU SANFORD (taking over for her husband): 
BOB is no longer a public accountant although he received his CPA certificate last spring. Now he is the office manager for Western Leather Co. in Mil­waukee and he's deep in work. 
We received a few letters since the last issue went to press and I hope all the letters are here. You see, %re have a mischievous daughter who loves to get into her Daddy's desk—you know how that is. 
Bob mislaid WALT WUEBEOLD's letter but it turned np, and here we go: "Occasionally I hear from HARRY BOISVERT who opened a law office in Washington, D. C. (in partnership with PAT GORMAN). Several weeks ago DAN HUSHEK and his wife drove up Ittmi Cindnnati to see me. Dan is working for McCarthy Contracting Co. as an 
Voltime 27, No. I, Jcm.-Feb., 1949 
auditor on the Cincinnati Ohio River Floodwall project. Over the holidays, PAUL HELLMUTH drove down from Springfield and p^d me a visit. Paul graduated from Harvard Law School and passed the Ohio Bar last summer. (One of the top men, f hear). He is now practicing in Boston with an old law firm at that city. 
"About every week I see JOHN BRODBERGER and HOWARD ROHAN. John is associated with his father in a peanut commodity company. Howard is now working as a customers man with a Cincinnati brokerage firm. Both of these bo>3 are among Cin­cinnati's most eligible bachelors. "CHUBBY" HOUS­TON married a Detroit girl and resides in Detroit, where he is working for one of the General Motors divisions. Both of the FERNEDIXG twins are still doing things in twos. They are working for the same firm, the Dayton Xenia Railroad Co. in Day­ton. They both married about two years ago and live in the same apartment building. 
GORDY WH^•E^f AN writes that he has been a member of the Minneapolis Grain Exchange for the past six years in the capacity of a wheat buyer for General Mills. "I married the girl from Williams-ville, N. Y., who came to South Bend for the Senior Ball. We have two girls, three and five years. No complaints and am living a very happy life. I'd sure Uke to know what happened to JOHNNY KELLY. PHH. SHERIDAN, BOB LEIBIU and WALT WAR­BURTON. I see TOM McKENNA every year or so in Buffalo, N. Y., where he's doing very nicely in the insurance business." 
FARRIS SATTA was in Milwaukee this spring and called. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and missed seeing him, much to our disappointment. 
We see the JOHN GAVANS now and tlien and always enjoy them tremendously. They have a beau­tiful little girl. They've named her Barbara. 
Lois and BUD LINNEHAN are the proud parents of Cathleen Dianne much to the delight of her older sister, Sharon, two and a half years. 
I sincerely hope that you men of '40 are not as busy as Bob is and will manage to let him know where you are and any other news you happen to know. I can just picture Bob saying, "Jfen of '40! Get that news to Shorty'."—and do just that—won't you? 
[Ed. note: The managing editor, after sjwnding an evening with the Sanfords early in December— the steak was wonderful—can agree, reluctantly, that Robert is a busy man. But you know what they say about busy men getting things done, so rush him a lot of news.] 
From HARRY MARTIN, insurance man at Rhinc-Under, Wis., to BOB SANFORD: 
"I've wondered many times what has happened to you during the last few fevered years—I suppose you traveled all over hell etc., and are now enjoying a relatively quiet life. Are you married? As you perhaps know I am busy raising quite a family. At the last count, I had three, Kathy (8), Barbara 
(5) and H. H. Martin (3) . . . my son is now old enough to mow the lawn, take care of the furnace, etc. . . . 
"Some time ago 1 got the addresses of JACK COOK, and FATHER N. C. HOFF, and wrote to both of them—^I guess that was about two years ago. Neither answered, and I presume they did not receive the letters." 
From JACK WILKINSON, athleUc director at Northeastern College, Portland, Me., to BOB S.\N­FORD: 
"Although it's been a long time since 1 have written to any of my former classmates at N.D., I ha\*e not forgotten them or you. 
"After a hitch in the armed forces, 1 coached Maine high schools, and had two state tournament teams. I recently received my appointment to North­eastern. 
"I am a family man now. Married the former Ellen Twomey of Biddeford, daughter of veteran baseball umpire Mike Twomey. 
"banning on attending the 1950 class reunion. It certainly will be great to see the old gang. 
"Still get a thrill out of old college memories, and to the realization of having once been a varsity track man at Notre Dame.

JOHN QUINCY ADAMS, '26, president of the Manhattan Refrigerator Co. and of the Union Terminal Cold Storage Co. of New York City, on Oct. 17 received the first Quadragesimo Anno Medal awarded by the .Association of Catholic Trade Unionists. Mr. Adams, a resident of Upper Montclair, N. J., is the founder and first president of the Catholic Institute of the Food Industry— "what is perhaps in this country the first association of Catholic Employers and rep­resentatives of Management." 
In the persentation citation, Mr. Adams was lauded as a "distinguished alumnus of the University of Notre Dame . . . effective leader of his colleagues in the Food Indus­try, for his understanding of Catholic Social Doctrine, for his self-sacrificing personal efforts to bring reason and justice into the recent Wall Street Strike. . . ." 
Officials of the ACTU said that the pres­entation of the medal to Mr. Adams marked one of the few times in the history of or­ganized labor that an employer had received an award from workers. The medal will be awarded annually to "an individual who makes an outstanding contribution to the Christian solution of industrial problems." 
Some 200 members of the food trades of the New York area gathered at Cavanagh's Restaurant on Oct. 26 to pay honor to Mr. Adams. Raymond A. Geiger, '32, especially designated by Rev. John J. Cavanaugh, C.S.C., president, represented the University and conveyed felicitations. The guest of honor received a scroll, bearing the names of all those present, and a wrist watch.

Responding to the call for volunteers, and bringing us a bit of news also, HARRY LAVERY, last seen at Columbia Law School, has come through with some good words. Harry is practidng with Camp­bdl, Clltfaero and Fisc^r in Chicago, at One La-Salle Street Building. He wrote Nov. 29: 
"Being that I'm not in the Army, I guess it can't hurt to step forward (figurati^-ely) and volunteer— saw in the De c '48 ALUMNUS that some spade work tvill have to be done for the class reunion next year, so (»unt me in. . . . 
"Noticed in the same issue that I graduated from Harvard; I assume that )-ou aren't responsible for this nusinfocmation. If so, Manhattan must have located more like Cambric^e to >'OU than it did to me. 
"The Northwestern game brought out a goodly number of the lads. TOM O'CONNOR, HARRY YEATES and EARL ENGLERT et uxor were back for the game. Tom is one of the partners in Ben­nett, Fetescb & O'Connor, Advertising, in Chicago; and Harry is getting quite expert in the clothes buy­ing 6eld. Saw VINCE DUNCAN on my way out to the stadium; and around town at various places I ran into TED SMITH, JIM BURKE, and se\xral of the fellows who are in the Law School. 
"Think it was the week-end of the Purdue game that I saw BOB MILFORD, now an attorney in Marion, Ind., and TOM McGUIRE, of Fowler, Ind., and Dun and Bradstreet. This summer I ttxik in a Chicago Club dance and ran into BILL KEN­NY; he told me that he was selling hea\-y machi­nery." 
Harry's name goes to the lop of the list, and as our reunion gets nearer, we want you to keep h?m in mind. And we hope that we will be hearing from more of you in the South Bend-Chicago area. Whoe\-er is able to help, please contact us here in the column, or through the Alumni Association at Notre Dame.
