Ninety-Fifth Commencement Looms Big 
Bishop Shell, V-P Harrison of A. T. & T., Speakers; Dedi­
cation of Rockne Memorial of Universal Interest; Reunion 
Classes Planning Major Programs; June 2, 3 and 4. 
Significant of the depth of the de­velopment of Notre Dame is the scope of its annual commencements. This year, so rapidly have projects brought the months in procession, plans for commencement are not yet complete, yet already they embody a program of which the University and its alum­ni and the Class of 1939 may well be proud. 
In the persons of Most Rev. B. J. Sheil, D.D., Auxiliai-y Bishop of Chi­cago, nationally known for his work OTth the C.Y.O., and William H. Har­rison, executive of the great Ameri­can Telephone and Telegraph Com­pany, the baccalaureate and com­mencement addresses promise a range and reflection of knowledge and ex­perience always the objective of these annual features of the commence­ment. 
Outstanding for alumni, and for all friends of Notre Dame, is the dedica­tion of the completed Rockne Memo­rial Fieldhouse. The significance of Rockne himself, and the magnificent fitness of the Memorial, combine to make this an historical step in an era crowded with construction. A fitting program will feature the dedication, which will, according to tentative plans, be broadcast nationally. 
Of particular significance, too, for alumni, will be the honoring at the Alumni Banquet of a small but be­loved and well known group of pro­fessors whom age and ill health are taking from the active ranks of Notre Dame teachers. 
Other events are traditional—^but more in the way in which war, and love, and storms, and floods, and other elemental upheavals are tradi­tional. The Class Reunions . . . the theatre production . . . the Band and Glee Club concerts . . . the election of national officers . . . the baseball game with M.S.C. . . . the golf tour­naments . . . the sessions . . . the graduating Class and the pageantry of the progi-am .. . if these seem to scribing these phenomena, which year be dismissed lightly, it is not because after year generate a novelty and a of a lack of respect, but because of a vigor which shames the sameness of cei-tain awed loss of speech in de­the announcement of them.

Notre Dame Economic Study Heralded 
Bureau of Economic Research, Headed by Rev. Edward Keller, C.S.C., Produces First Study of Physical Assets of U. S.; Greeted As Refutation of Wealth Concentration. 
Alumni from coast to coast have been made aware through the press of a book edited by the Rev. Edward 

A. Keller, C.S.C,. head of the bureau of economic research of the Univer­sity. A Study of the Physical Assets, Sometimes Called Wealth, of the United States, 1922-1933, is the title of Father Keller's book, which Rev. John F. O'Hara, C.S.C, president of the University, describes in a fore­word thus: 
"A few years ago, the University of Notre Dame, disturbed by publi­cized orthodox speculations regarding our material existence, decided to conduct a research program on the national economy, that is, on the Management of the Household Budget of the people of the United States. 
"This research had but one object —to find the truth about our mate­rial existence (using official govern­ment data) and to translate this truth into words so simple that any­one could understand it. 
"The first results of the research, published in this volume, are in real­ity, a 'Primer of Economics: An Essay in .4dult Education." 
Widespread Reaction 

The Study has been incorporated in the Congressional Record. 
The Hearst papers, editorializing in a three-column page-length com­ment titled "The New Promise," said in part: ". . . Notre Dame University should be commended for initiating a series of valuable pioneering studies of this tj^e. . . The volume of 'candid camera' shots of the American eco­nomic system at work is so simple that evei-y eighth grade schoolboy can understand and be inspired by the record of national achievement. . . . In revealing the simple realities, the book clears the atmosphere of the phoney and disturbing remedies which have been proposed during the last nine subnormal years. . . ." 
Merryle S. Rukeyser, syndicate col­umnist, wi-ote: "Notre Dame Univer­sity has made a 90-yard run and a brilliant touchdown on the economic gridiron through publication of a no­table volume concerning American wealth . . . the study lifts economics out of the esoteric realm of meta­physics and alphabet juggling and tells vividly the story of American long-term achievement in improving popular living standards. The volume .. . is affirmative in tone. . . . Busi­ness will welcome this nejv series of economic studies, of which only the iirst has been released. Business men will understand the bookkeeping lan­guage and the undertaking is a token expression of the concept that the sci­entific inquiring mind is not neces­sarily hostile to private enterprise. .. . If theoretical economists study the new volume they will be shocked by the significance of the parade of realism and fact-finding." 

Further Press Comment 
Royal F. Munger, writing in Com­merce, Chicago, says, as the prelude to a long discussion of Father Keller's book: ".. . If its viewpoint receives the wide circulation which we expect, it will go far toward bringing Amer­ican economic discussion to a more common sense basis. . . ." 
Phil S. Hanna prepared a seiies of articles for the Chicago Journal of Commerce, based on the survey. -A.mong other things, he says: ". . . Notre Dame drives home the little appreciated truth that the low in­come groups in the United States do have what is commonly known as 'wealth' even though the aver­age man does not consider him­self wealthy. .. . It is right at this juncture in national affairs where one appreciates the value of such a com­pilation. Hundreds of times during the past six years, as the class-hatred campaign has progressed, writers and speakers have pointed out that the people of the United States head the list in possessions of such things as automobiles, radios, washin g ma­chines, telephones, wired homes, etc., etc.; but no one that we know of has taken the trouble to point out how greatly this $222,000,000,000, worth of comfort goods is diffused among people of low incomes. . . . 
The Indianapolis Star leads off an editorial on the Study thus: "The Study .. . is sure to be an embarrass­ment to those who talk glibly of how this country is owned by GO families. , . . The data he presents disposes effectually of the notion that a few either do or could control the wealth of this coimtry. . .." 
The South Bend Tribtme, speaking editorially, said: ". . . As a guide to straight public thinking on one of the major issues in the United States to­day this University of Notre Dame primer should be invaluable." 
The general theme of Father Kel­ler's book is briefly but carefully out­lined in the official press release of the University, through Thomas J. Barry, '25. Excerpts from this re­lease follow. 
"Rev. Edward Keller, C.S.C, direc­tor of the University's Bureau of Economic Research, takes direct is­sue with economists who base esti­mates of wealth concentration on pro­bated estates, wealth of corporations, and similar sources, in his book A Study of the Physical Assets of the United States. Using government data, he has coimted the produced or productive things in the country and shown that by their very nature (i.e., farm lands, houses, radios, automo­biles, etc.) the bulk of America's wealth cannot be either held or used by a small group. 
Conclusions Are Brief 
"An unusual feature of the work is that the introductory text consists of but twenty-two pages in which the terminology is avplained, the aims and conclusions are outlined. These conclusions, in turn, are supported by approximately a hundred and twenty pages of statistics, which cover every operation of the national economy.... 
"The survey approaches the study of wealth by defining wealth as "phy­sical assets, or all physical things use­ful and capable of control and owner­ship by human beings." It excludes paper money and securities as being evidences of ownership and not phy­sical assets. The method followed is a detailed "counting of all physical things." The government data used is reclassified into 'comfort' assets and 'production' assets.

•jWnsS JOSEPHINE BROWNSON, 
•^'-'- president of the Catholic Instruc­tion League of Detroit, was an­nounced on March 19 as this year's recipient of the Laetare Medal be­stowed annually by the University upon an outstanding member of the Catholic laity. 
The naming of Miss Brownson by the Laetare Committee marks the first time since the inauguration of the medal award in 1883 that a de­scendant of a former medalist has received this honor, the highest a Catholic lajTnan can receive in the United States. Miss Brownson's fath­er, the late Henry F. Brownson, was the medalist for the year 1892. Her grandfather, Orestes A. BrowTison, known as "the father of American philosophy," was on his way to Notre Dame in April, 1876, to join the Uni­versity's faculty when death overtook him. His body is interred in the base­ment chapel on the campus and the University has the residence dormi­torj' bearing his name. 
Known lor her educational activi­ties, Miss Brownson is the eleventh woman to receive the medal, the last one so honored hav^ing been the late Mrs. Genevieve Garvan Brady Mac­auley. New York philanthropist, who received the medal in 1934. 
In announcing the award. Rev. John F. O'Hara, C.S.C., president of Notre Dame, made the following statement: 
"While this year's Laetare Medal is awarded in tribute to the pioneering spirit and the long and faithful devo­tion of Miss Bro\\'nson to the cause of religious instruction, it contains at the same time a recognition of a very important section of Pope Pius XI's program of Catholic action. Miss Brownson was one of the first Cath­olics in any country to organize on an extensive scale the catechetical instruction ordered by Pope Pius X in his encyclical Acerbo Nimis published in 1905. In the intervening 34 years, one country after another has organ­ized catechetical instruction on a large scale." 

In 1906 Miss Brownson established the Catholic Instruction League in Detroit for the purpose of instructing Catholic children in public schools. At the present time she has some 400 teachers and 13,000 students under her supervision. Formerly an instruc­tor of mathematics in a Detroit high school, the medalist resigned her posi­tion to devote her time to religious instruction. 
In recognition of Miss Brownson's contribution to the cause of Catholic Action, the late Pope Pius XI con­ferred on her the Papal decoration Pro Ecclesla et Pontifice in 1933. 
Both in Catholic Action and in the field of writing Miss Brownson car­ries on the literary traditions of her family, begun by Orestes A. Brown­son. Her published books include Liv­ing Forever, Feed My Lambs and To the Heart of a Child. 
Given by Notre Dame as a recogni­tion of merit and as an incentive to greater achievement, the Laetare 
Miss JOSEPHINE BROWNSON 
Medal award originated in the an­cient papal custom of bestowing the Golden Rose on a member of the Italian Catholic nobility on Laetare Sunday, fourth Sunday in Lent. Its modem counterpart was inaugurated at Notre Dame in 1883 when the Very Rev. Edward Sorin, C.S.C, University-founder, bestowed the first medal on the late John Gilmary Shea, eminent Catholic historian. 
Tlie presentation of the medal to Miss Brownson will take place at 8 P. M. on Sunday, June 4, in Wash­ington Hall. 
TWrAJOR CHANGES calling for an 
enlarged scope for graduate work in the social program at the Univer­sity have been announced. 
The announcement coincided with the appointment of Professor Frank 
T. Flynn by the president of the Uni­versi^. Rev. John F. O'Hara, C.S.C, as director of the Graduate Program in Social Work. 
The changes announced include ex­tensive revision of courses, new field work facilities -which call for in­creased cooperation with South Bend 
social workers, and new courses of 
studies. The new director stated that 
the department will meet all the re­
quirements of the American Associa­
tion of Schools of Social Work for 
Type I schools. 
The new courses to be added include 
one in social insurance which will take 
cognizance of the changes in this field 
w-hich have occurred during the past 
few years. Two other new courses to 
be offered in the fall term are in pub­
lic -welfare administration and medical 
information. 
The field work will consist of 
students spending approximately 15 
hours a week in supervised work 
with actual cases dealt with by major 
social work organizations. The new 
work program will bring the students 
in close contact with a variety of so­
cial problems, enabling them to make 
practical application of their back­
ground in social science theory. 
Professor Flynn, the new director, is a native of Pa-wtiicket, Rhode Is­land, and was graduated from Provi­dence College, Providence, R. I., in 1929. He received his master's degree at Notre Dame in 1931 and -worked as a graduate student and assistant at the University of Chicago's School of Social Service -Administration in 1932 and 1933. In July, 1937, he was ap­pointed to a four-year term as mem­ber of the Board of Trustees of the Indiana State prison by Governor Clifford AL TowTisend. 
Professor Flynn is the co-author of Social Problems, written in collab­oration with Rev. Raymond W. Mur­ray, C.S.C, head of the Department of Sociology at the University. The book has been highly acclaimed as a valu­able document on the social service sciences. 
The Knights of Columbus were the original sponsors of the courses in social service at Notre Dame, and they have continued to lend their sup­port for training of Catholic leaders as a definite part of their Social Ac­tion program. Knights of Columbus scholarships as well as university scholarships are available for quali­fied graduates of accredited colleges and universities.

B. J. KAISER—Ben Kaiser won a great deal of renown, with the Class of 1912, and the Alumni OiEce in par­ticular, for his masterful handling of the Silver Jubilee Reunion, of that Class.

CHARLES E. "GUS" DORAIS, '14 
nHARLES EMILE "GUS" DORAIS, ^ '14, will be one of the principal speakers when the Rockne Memorial Fieldhouse is dedicated on Saturday afternoon, June 3. Intimate friend, roommate, teammate of Rock, he is uniquely qualified for such an honor. His—and Rock's—silver anniversary class of 1914 win be gathered in re­union to greet him and hear him. 
Gus is now director of athletics and head football coach at the University of Detroit, where his teams and many of his players have become known na­tionally. His coaching experience began at Dubuque College, Dubuque, Iowa, later called Columbia, now known as Loras. He was there from 1914 to 1917 inclusive. He joined the Army in 1918 and was detailed as director of sports in Camp MacAr­thur, Waco, Texas. 
In 1919, Gus was back at Notre Dame as backfield coach under Rock and basketball coach, but in 1920 he took over the position of director of athletics and head coach at Gonzaga University, Spokane, Washington. His exceptional record there brought him viide prominence. In 1925, he went to Detroit and has remained there ever since, despite frequently ru­mored opportunities to coach else-, where. 
Gus was married to Miss Viola Fettgather, of Dubuque, Iowa, in 1917 and he is the father of three boys and two girls. He lists his hobbies as fishing, hunting and golf, in that order. 
An active and devoted member of the Notre Dame Club of Detroit and the Alumni Association, Gus has given freely of time, energy and re­markable speaking ability in the ser­vice of the University and local Notre Dame clubs. 
XpDWARD F. O'TOOLE, besides be­

EDWARD F . 0'TOOLE, '25 
work closely with the new Placement Bureau of the Alumni Oifice. 
A native of Amboy, Illinois, Ed was graduated from the Law School and the Glee Club in '25. Since 1926 he has been engaged in the private prac­tice of law in Chicago and he is now a member of the firm of England, 0'Toole and Kays, -ivith offices at 10 South La Salle Street. His clubs are the Electric and the Brookwood Coun­try. 
Western Springs, a Chicago suburb, is home to Ed and he is welcomed there every evening by the two O'Toole daughters and Mrs. OToole. 
Ed has consistently been one of the most active members of the Chicago Club and a loyal attendant at many and varied campus events. He is already working enthusiastically on his new club assignment and vnll be in a position to contribute valuable advice on placement at the tenth an­nual Club Council to be held on the Sunday morning of Commencement week-end. 
"DEV. MICHAEL LEE MORI ARTY,

But crim­inal we're going to be, just to provide for you, as this small opportunity is offered, a quick glance behind the bright smile of one of Notre Dame's best known and most inspiring alumni. 
Many of you know that Father Mor­iarty is chaifcnan of the Catholic Char­ities Bureau and Catholic Hospitals in the Cleveland diocese and vice-chair­man of the diocesan board of Catholic Charities. That is just the start. Here are some of his other activities: a member of the board of trustees of the Cleveland Welfare Federation, Cleveland Hospital Council, Children's Bureau, Children's Aid Society and Legal Aid Society; a member of the board of directors of the Sight Saving Council, Consumer's League, Travel­er's Aid Society, Negro Welfare As­sociation, Cleveland Chapter, Ameri­can Red Cross; a member of the ad­visory board of the state division of Public Assistance, Cleveland Hospital Service Association and the Anti-Tuberculosis League.

suffer from idleness. Father Moriarty is a member of the executive commit­tee of the National Conference of Catholic Charities and of many social welfare committees in Cleveland. He is also a member of the American As­sociation of Social Workers. 
"Mike Moriarty at Notre Dame" might be a separate treatise on stu­dent life on the campus (Father Mike, besides being an outstanding student, was secretary of his class and a mon­ogram man on the track team), but we must keep up this feverish pace. Studies at St. Bernard's Seminary, Eochester, and St. Mary's Seminary, Cleveland, culminated in his ordina­tion in 1915. Assignments in St. John's Cathedral and in Cathedral Latin School kept him in Cleveland until 1922, when he was appointed pastor of Immaculate Conception par­ish, Wooster, Ohio. He remained there until Bishop—^now Archbishop —Schrembs appointed him Charities director in 1933. 
And we haven't told you about his continuous devotion to the welfare of the Notre Dame Club of Cleveland nor about his starring roles at the Football Banquets—especially at the "Will Rogers Banquet" of 1935. Many things must wait. But please read between the lines of what we've been able to tell here. 
VAN WALLACE TO LOURDES 

An announcement of great interest and inspiration is made by the Notre Dame Club of Detroit that the Club will head a drive for a $5,000 fund to enable Van Wallace to be taken this summer to Lourdes. Victim of a diving injury which broke his neck in the summer of 1924, Van has already seemed under the special protection of Our Lady, in whose University he had completed his freshman year. Al­though paralyzed from the neck down, he has survived and been a source of inspiration to all who have known his case. The Club in Detroit secured a special car which has en­abled the family to transport Van more freely, and he has seen several football games at Notre Dame, and attended several Club meetings. 
It was a happy coincidence that current news also carried the an­nouncement that Notre Dame's other alumnus to whom infantile paralysis brought similar confinement, Fred Suite Jr., will make the pilgrimage to Lourdes during the coming summer. 
Alumni clubs, or individual.s, wish­ing to help the Detroit Club achieve its objective of sending Van Wallace to Lourdes are asked to contact the president of the club, Howard Beech­inor, 1300 Union Guardian Building, Detroit, Michigan. 
Memorial Dedication June 3 
The Ceremony Is To Be Part of Commencement 
Saturday, June 3, at 4:30 o'clock, Notre Dame wil enjoy one of its most significant an d mos t anticipated events in the formal dedication of the Knute K. Rockne Memorial Field-house. 
Tradition, character, alumni and public participation, beauty, and util­ity combine to make this Memorial one of the great steps in the building of the Greater Notre Dame. 
Eev. John F. O'Hara, C.S.C, pres­ident of the University, will represent the University. 
Major John Griffiith, commissioner of athletics of the Western Confer­ence, will represent the National Col­legiate Athletic Association. 
Warren Brown and Arch Ward will represent the sports writers, with Arch Ward doubling as master of ceremonies. 
Charles E. "Gus" Dorais will speak on behalf of Rock's own teammates. 
Elmer F. Layden, director of ath­letics of the University, will speak on behalf of the Rockne-trained coaches. 
The University Band wil supply music for the occasion. 
The entire Memorial is now opened to the use of the students, and has already proved the claims for popu­larity and worth which were made for it in the presentation of this type of structure as a fitting Memorial. 
APRIL REVIEW OF POLITICS APPEARS 
Fascism, Nazism, and Communism are neither forms of government nor idealistic political doctrines but mere­ly names of methods to cloak the "gangster" ambitions of Hitler, Mus­solini and Stalin, according to Etienne De GreefF, noted European criminolo­gist of the University of Louvain in Belgium. 
Dr. De GreefF, writing in the April issue of The Revieio of Politics, new Notre Dame quarterly publication, adds that Hitler appeals to the lowest and most depraved types of humanity with whose aid he makes himself the supreme "gangster."

An article titled "The 1938 Elec­tions and the American Party Sys­tem" is by Professor D. A.

NO SMUT! As a result of activity by the Hier­archy, the Diocese of Fort Wayne leading the way, Notre Dame students have joined Bishop Noll in a cam­paign to stamp out smut in the news stands of the nation. A pamphlet, "No Smut," prepared by the Univer­sity's student committee, has won wide acclaim among high school stu­dents particularly, for whom it was written. A very pertinent suggestion is made by an alumnus of '34 that the Association take up this project, in conjunction with the students, and speed the circulation of these pam­phlets among the school children, the priests, the news stand proprietors, and other interested parties. The pamphlets can be secured for five cents or in large 'quantities at a re­duced rate, from the Prefect of Reli­gion. For details, address Rev. Fran­cis Gartland, C.S.C, Notre Dame, Indiana. 

CAMPUS NOTES 
BLOOD MONEY 
Promoter Louis DaPra, pride of East Chicago and points west, this year led his Battlin' Bengaleers to the highest peak the Bengal Bouts have ever attained, ^^'hen all expenses are paid the biggest check ever vrill be sent to the missions; but the biggest thing about the fight was the amount of blood spilt in the four nights of preliminaries and the finals of March 24. 

About four thousand persons heard the wildest announcer in the mid-west, Bemie Fagan, Bath N. Y., bawl out the names of the winners: Harry John, Milwaukee, 'Wis., 155, who squeezed out a win over Bill McGrath, Lawrence, K. Y.; Walt Johnson, Bronxvile, N. Y., 1G5, who defeat­ed Harry McLaughlin, Royal Oak, Mich.; lightweight Jerry Ryan, Sus­quehanna, Pa., K.O.'d Vic Vergara, Larchmont, N. Y.; heavyweight Jim Ford, Binghamton, N. Y., beat Ed Stelmaszek, Chicago, III.; 115 pound Bill Dilhoefer, Glen Ridge, N. J., pounded Johnny Francies, Chagrin Falls, Ohio, until the seconds threw in a towel; Bob Duffey, Monroe, Mich., hit Vince Gurracharri, Philippine Is­lands, so hard that everyone thought he was out for a week. 
Sam Dolce, Chicago, got a well-booed decision from Bill Schickel, Ithaca, N. Y. But the climax came in the evening's final as Rod Magulre, Canton, 111., got a technical K.O. over two-time champ Jim Brown, Belle Harbor, N. Y., in one of the hardest battles Bengal fans have ever seen. 
Of six returning champions in the Bouts only Sam Dolce and Harry John were able to retain their crornis. Five freshmen: Magulre, Duffey, Dill­hoefer. Ford and Ryan, won titles for next year's crop to try to take away. From the scraps they put up that won't be any easy matter; almost makes us wish we would be here to see things ourselves. 
ELECTION BATTLE 
The freshman class, it was ru­mored, held an election March 14. Though there were over a thousand voters only 219 ballots were cast. Paul Lillis, New York City, tackle and engineer of note, became class presi­dent, beating Ed Sullivan, Belle Har­bor, N. Y. Leo Hagerty, Kenmore, 
N. Y., took a one-vote decision from Robert Donahoe, Sioux Falls, S. Dak., to become secretary. John Mead, Jack­sonville, Fla., and Edward Monahan, Jersey City, N. J., slipped into vice-presidency and treasurership unop­posed.

THE DRAMA 
The year's last production of the University Theatre, Robert Sher­wood's Queen's Husband, met with a warmed-over reception in its two per­formances on the campus. Ray Sad-lier, Brooklyn, IST. Y"., and Miss Doris Ward handled the leads capably. Miss Barbara Southard and Bob Blake, Canton, Ohio, took the romantic leads in stride, but just between us girls Jerry Hogan's BrookljTiese two-line flunkey part stole the show. 
KNIGHT'S NIGHT 
Jim Rocap, Indianapolis, Ind., led the embattled K. of C. in their annual Formal on April 21 at the Palais Royale. Griff Williams supplied the music and about 150 couples the in­spiration. Chairmen were: Robert Ortale, Kingston. N. Y., jira Metzler, Kansas City, Mo., Tom Hogan, Brook­lyn, N.

Notre Dame's own campus orchestra, the Modemaires, has attracted attention elsewhere: Maestro Karl Hunn, Chillicothe, Ohio, got a letter from Paul Whiteman's agent requesting the band change its

MISFORTUNE PLUS 
Debate coaches must have special spots reser\-ed for them in heaven. If not they certainly deserve them. Take the case of Notre Dame's own Wil­liam Coyne, for instance. On a balmy March day he had all of his debaters ^Tapped up for delivery at a tourna­ment in Iowa City; all that is, wt h the exception of Frank Parks, Rice Lake, Wis., who at the last moment had developed a fever. So John Win­termeyer. Kitchener, Ontario, went along and everything was fine—^up to the point where Wintermeyer was rushed to an Iowa City hospital for an emergency appendectomy. 
THE CAMPUS SWINGS 
When Chairman Joe Ryan, Buftalo, New York, and Class President Rich­ard O'Melia, Rhinelander, Wisconsin, set experimental foot upon the boards of the "revised" Rockne Memorial basketball floor May 5, the signal was given for about 300 seniors and guests to "set in" on the first dance given on the campus since that Dining Hall party of some years ago. 
The hallowed walls of Badin bound­ed the echoes of Freddy Martin's music into the Dillon-Alumni court to haunt sleepy-eyed iconoclasts who didn't believe in the new swing. Paul Donovan, Elmira, New York, was in charge of the tea dance Saturday at the South Bend Country Club.

Beins More of the illustrious Company Who Renew Old Memories On the New Roster; and a Story of Their Meeting and Organization to Crystallize a Fine Tradition 
Since the last ALUJi>rus published approximately half the names of sons whose fathers and grandfathers were Notre Dame men, a meeting of this group has been held. This issue is happy to complete the roster, as we have been able to determine it. Also, the group of boys was so enthusiastic that the organization is meeting May 3 to organize a permanent club to perpetuate this growing tradition. 
The ALUMNUS, using those methods which developed the Pinkerton boys in their student days here, missed at least a couple of bets in the iirst issue. For example: 
Danny Hilgartner, now in school, is Daniel III, and Daniel Jr. is your nominee for president as elsewhere listed. 
Also, entirely, and entirely by acci­dent, we missed WILLIAM D. CUR­TIS, son of DANIEL C. CURTIS, '17, Rockford. Bill is a freshman A.B. student. 
HISS—Bernard F., son of Frank J. Hiss, '16, South Bend, is a first year Law student. His dad is prominent in the St. Joe Valley, both civic and alumni activities. 
HOSINSKI—Donald E., A.B. jun­ior, is the son of Al Hosinski, '16, South Bend. Al is federal marshal in the local district, and familiar in the political and social life of South Bend. 
KACZMAEEK—Jerome, Engineer­ing senior, and Richard, first year Law, are sons of Prof. Regidius Kacz­marek, '12, whose biology classes have been academic classics at Notre Dame for more than 25 years. 
KAMM—Adolph S., is the son of Dr. A. X. Kamm, '09, Ashland, Wis., but the Commerce junior bears a name of much more immediate signifi­cance to alumni, who remember his dad as one of the Mishawaka family who have always taken an active in­terest in Notre Dame. 
KANALEY—Byron V. Jr., Com­merce freshman bears a distinguished background. His application was filed immediately after his birth by his dad, Byron V.

182 The Notre Dame Alumnus May. 1939 
BY JOSEPH S. PETRITZ. '32 « Director of Athletic Publicity 
ATHLETICS 
Notre Dame's spring: sports teams, as this \%-as written, had a composite record of eight victories, one tie, and one defeat. The track team, which may survive its dual competition un­defeated, had not yet opened its out­door season. 
BASEBALL 
Coach Jake Kline's haseball team was well on its way to Notre Dame's 40th winning season in 46 campaigns with four victories and one defeat. Despite the lack of a southern trip and hampered by almost continual rain, the Irish have been playing in some respects like New York's Yan­kees. They have come out of pitch­
• ing duals when the opponents had ef­fective hurling. And when the other guys wanted to slug it out, the Irish were ready for that kind of game, too. 
Norvall Hunthausen, Captain Joe Nardone, and Eay Pinelli have been the shining lights so far. Hunt­hausen, a stocky, swart junior from St. Louis, has pitched the Irish to three victories, two of them shutouts. He has gone 29 innings without giv­ing an earned run. In his last 20 innings he hasn't given even an un­earned run. He has yielded but 14 hits and five walks, and he has struck out 26 men with his trusty right arm. Hunthausen won his first start from Illinois, 4 to 2, with the lUini getting two unearned runs in the eighth. He shut out Western State Teachers, 5 to 0, for Notre Dame's ninth straight over this usually effective foe. He shut out Purdue's Big Ten leaders, 9 to 0, with brilliant help from Ray Pinelli. He relieved for two innings against Northwestern. 
Captain Jim Thompson of Purdue hit a triple to left center which Left Fielder Ken Oberbruner overtook. He relayed it to Captain Nardone, cen­ter fielder, whose hurried thro w bounced to Pinelli in deep short. The latter slammed a strike into Catcher Art Verhoestra to nip Thompson slid­ing into the plate and thus preserve Norv's record. 
Nardone is not only fielding 1.000, but he's fifth in team hitting with .304, and an ideal leadoff man be­cause of his speed and daring on the baselines. He broke up the Purdue game in the fifth with a home run which scored Himthausen and touched off a six-run splurge. Nardone also has a triple to his credit this year. 
Eay Pinelli, younger of the t;vo San Francisco Pinellis on the team— sons of "Babe" Pinelli, former big league star and now one of the best umpires in the business — leads the team at the plate with a .4S5 average. He has batted in six runs to lead in that department. He leads in total bases %vith 13 to Nardone's and Chet Sullivan's 12, as well as in total hits with 10 to Nardone's and Sullivan's 7. Sullivan, vrith only one error to date, is holding down third base effectively. 
Ray Pinelli scored his brother Eoy, right fielder, with a triple in the 12th and came home on a 'svild throw to third to win the Chicago game, 9 to 
7. All hands took part in the 4 to 2 defeat of Illinois in the opener, with Steve Scovic scoring once and driv­ing in tvvo more runs with his per­fect day—three singles in as many trips. Scovic has since slumped slight­ly, and Roy Pinelli has replaced him in right field. 
The Irish outhit Northwestern 11 to 10, but couldn't bunch their blows off George Recht and John Goldack of the Wildcats for any impressive run-making. Rex Ellis pitched effec­tively until the fifth when the 'Cats bunched hvo triples and a double to break up the game with three runs. 
Hitting honors in the 5 to 0 con­quest of Western State were well di­vided, with Hunthausen's shutout hurling featuring the dual. The Broncos show a winning percentage against all but two teams on their schedule, Michigan being the other. The Irish have won 19 and lost 5 in the series. Michigan's record is 10 victories and 7 defeats.

(Commencement same) 

TRACK 
If you have been following the ALUMNUS through the winter season, you know as well as this department 
the chances of the Irish during the 

outdoor campaign. The schedule calls 
for dual meets with Ohio State, Mich­
igan State, and Marquette, a defense 
of the Indiana State title and the 
Central Collegiate conference cham­
pionship, and then the N.CA.A. meet 
at Los AJigeles in which Captain Greg 
Eice will try to recapture his two-mile 
championship. He won it in record 
time as a sophomore in the second 
race he ever ran at the two-mile dis­
tance. He lost it last year by half a 
second to Walter Mehl of Wisconsin, 
also in record time. It'll be a hard 
workout, but we look for first place 
in the duals, the State and the CCC 
meets. 
There'll be more next month about the track team, and meanwhile here's the schedule: 
April 28-29—Drake Relays at Des Moines 
April 28-29—Penn Relays at Philadelphia 
May 6—Ohio State at Columbus 
May 13—Michigan State at East Lansing 
May 20—^Marquette at Notre Dame 
May 27—Indiana State Meet at Notre Dame 
June 2—(Central Collegiate Conference at 
Milwaukee 

June 16-17—^National Collegiate A.A. at 
Los Angeles

GOLF 
Following close upon Notre Dame's first and only losing golf season, 1938, the Rev. George L. Holderith, C.S.C., predicts a \vinner for 1939. And well he may, for the opening match saw a revived team drop Illinois, 20% to 6%. Feature of the meet was the play of Sammy Neild, sophomore in his first intercollegiate match. He shot a 68, two under par and a new competitive course record for the 18­hole William J. Burke-Notre Dame layout. In the morning Neild and Walter Hagen, Jr., had their Illinois opponents three down for the first nine and two down with two to go with two holes left, Illinois, in other words, was one up for the back nine. Neild dropped a 40-foot chip to square it and to give the Irish 2% points to % in the nassau scoring. 
Captain Tom Sheehan, Jr., Phil Donohue, Chuck Bennett, Bill Schal­ler, AValter Hagen, Jr., Joe Corcoran, and Joe Stulb are all playing better golf this year than last, although Donohue is shanking his irons, it's said, at this writing. The addition of Neild for the No. 2 spot has ob­viously helped considerably. 
Billy Castleman has used up his eligibility, but he's still in school and has to date won the interhall bowling doubles title, and -has entered the 
May/1939 The Notre Dame Alumnus 
finals of the interhall table tennis tournament with Neild as his partner. 
The rest of the golf schedule fol­lows : 
April 29:—Marquette at Milwaukee 
May 1-—Chicago at Notre Dame 
May 6—Purdue at Lafayette 
May 8—^Michigan at Notre Dame

TENNIS 
Coach Pedro de Landero is finally 

satisfied that Notre Dame has a "good 
tennis team." He points out that it 
isn't a great unit,- but he predicts 
Notre Dame's first winning season in 
more than a decade, and the balance 
of his team would seem to bear him 
out. 
The Irish defeated Wabash and 

Detroit each, 7 to to 0, and then 
trimmed Indiana, 7 to 2. A scheduled 
match with DePauw was postponed 
because of rain. Then Notre Dame 
tied Kentucky, 4-all, at Lexington. 
Each team won three singles and one 
doubles. The deciding doubles match 
in which Captain Fred Simon and 
Whitney Gregory figured was tied at 
a game apiece in the match-deciding 
final set when the skies poured forth 
and ended matters. 
Rankings of the players and their records to date follow:

Of these only Gregory and Simon are seniors, while the freshman crop is better than average. The concen­tration of power in Northwestern and Chicago is too much for Notre Dame or any other middle western team to handle at this time. The Irish might possibly be on an even footing with the Wildcats next year, however, and seem almost certain to come up mth winners each of the next two seasons.

NOTRE DAME COACHES 
By William E. Scanlon, '42 

Knute Kockne's memory is being labeled across the nation's football horizon as graduates of the late coach, together with outstanding proteges of successors Hunk Anderson and Elmer Layden, assume important new positions in all parts of the country. 
The Notre Dame system, already handled in the East capably at Ford­ham, has new ex-Irish leaders at Holy Cross and Boston College. Earl Brown, Jr., All-American end last fall and captain of the 1938-39 bas­ketball squad, recently signed as end coach at his namesake school. Brown University. And Heartley (Hunk) Anderson, '22, deserted the ranks of drilling collegians at the University of Cincinnati under Chief Joe Meyer, ex. '16, to become coach of the Detroit Lions in the pro league. 
The move which resulted in the most changes centered around Dr. Edward Anderson, '22, who brought Holy Cross to the top in gridiron supre­macy. He replaced Irl Tubbs at the University of Iowa, near his native home and adjacent to the site of Loras College in Dubuque, called Columbia when the Doctor coached there. 
Completing his staff, Dr. ..Ajiderson brought Frank Carideo, '31, one of Notre Dame's greatest quarterbacks, to Iowa City as backfield coach. Frank won ail-American honors during the national championship seasons of 1929-30 under Eockne. He then served as backfield coach at Purdue for a year before taking an appoint­ment as head coach at Missouri. For the last three seasons he has been backfield mentor at Mississippi State. 
Replacing Anderson at Holy Cross is Joe Sheeketski, '33, backfield tutor under Dr. Anderson at that school. A vote of the players recommended Sheeketski as coach. Joe (together 
NAVY GAME 
Prices for the Navy-Notre Dame game in Cleveland nevt Oct. 21 have been announced by J. Arthur Haley, business manager of ath­letics, as follows: 
All box seats ?4.40. 
Reserved seats §3.30, ?2.20, §1.10. 
Children of high school age and under will be admitted for 50 cents. 
The sale will open August 1. Those not on the ticket application mailing list and desiring applica­tions for this game may obtain them in July through the Football Ticket Committee, Notre Dame, Ind. 

^vith Jim Harris, former Holy Cross line coach who also went to Iowa with Dr. .Anderson) played at Notre Dame in 1933. Sheeketski in turn signed Ed (Moose) Krause, head coach of all sports at St. Mary's College, in Winona, Minnesota, since 1934, as line coach for the Crusaders. 
In another part of the country, Frank Leahy, '31, tackle on the last team coached by Rockne in 1930, signed at Boston College, taking the spot held several years by Gloomy Gil Dobie. Leahy resigned as line coach under Jim Crowley at Fordham. in order to move on to Massachusetts. After receiving his degree from Notre Dame in 1931, Leahy went to George­to^vn as line coach, later moving to Fordham. Leahy selected Ed Mc-Keever, who attended Notre Dame in 1929-30, as backfield coach. 
Tom Lieb, '23, who handled the Notre Dame team during Rockne's ill­ness in 1929, resigned at Loyola Uni­versity in Los Angeles. Mannie Vezie, '31, Lieb's assistant, was considered for the post. 
In various other parts of the coun­try, Notre Dame men continue in top­flight positions. Of course, Elmer Layden remains at Notre Dame. Noble Kizer, '25, forced out of action by illness, resumed his duties as ath­letic director at Purdue while Mai El-ward, '16, made initial calls for spring drills. Marty Brill resigned as head coach at LaSalle College in Philadel­phia but school officials would not ac­cept it—and Marty was re-signed for the sixth consecutive season. 
Fordham's Jimmy Crowley, '25, re­cently returned from France where he headed a squad of 24 players se­lected from such schools as Holy Cross, Boston College, and Fordham who gave a series of exhibitions in princi­pal French cities. Jim will also head a series of football instructions at the World's Fair in New York City. 
Lou Little of Columbia succeeded Harry Stuhldreher, '25, Wisconsin's coach, as president of the Football Coaches Association. Layden of Notre Dame moved up as vice-president. Marchmont Schwartz, '32, recently signed again to coach at Creighton University. Jack Elder, '30, athletic director of the Chicago Catholic Youth Organization, was named to a special committee of the A.A.U. 
Harry J. Mehre, '22, recently signed another contract for five years as head coach and director of athletics at Mississippi. And Arch Ward, ex. '20, one of Rockne's first publicity writers and sports editor of the Chi­cago Tribune, has returned from Rome where he reported the corona­tion of His Holiness, Pope Pius XII, for his newspaper. John (Clipper) Smith, '29, resigned this spring after a colorful career at Dnquesne Uni­versity in Pittsburgh.

No other persons or channels are tuned in as generally and as closely as the Alumni Oifice to the details of Notre Dame Night. And so no other persons or channels appreciate as do we the growth and development of the Night as a world-wide tribute to Notre Dame, which, at the same time, is itself an increasing force in build­ing the institution to which it pays this yearly homage. 
Any attempt to become specific leads into an endless chain of Clubs and personalities which neither time nor space nor our comparatively vnde contacts can embrace. 
But it would be perhaps greater in­justice not to risk omitting a deserv­ing few in order to express apprecia­tion of some of the outstanding achievements of this 16th Annual Universal Notre Dame Night. 
To the National Broadcasting Com­pany goes the appreciation of the Association for enablin g alumni throughout the United States to hear the voice of Notre Dame, whether in Club meeting or in the far comers to which their various callings have

Fred C Solari, '35, Center St., Peinbroke, Mass., President; John J. Hanley, '34, 409 Salem St., Medford. Mass.. Secretary; Pan! aicManus, '34, 32 Pearl St. Dorchester, Mass., Secretary. 
The Boston Ciub met for its first meeting in some months on Sunday March 5 at the Brunswick Hotel. Any previous indications that the Boston alumni were disinterested in thin ^ Notre Dame -n-ere thoroughly discred­ited on that night when more than 85 mem­bers turned out to enjoy Joe Boland's superb entertainment. Fred Solan presided, and in­troduced Wayne Slillner, Charlie Crowley and Adam Walsh to the members. After brief speeches by these gentlemen, Joe took the floor and handled matters from there on. It was a grand evening, and as far as we're con-. 
taken them. There is no other me­dium which could achieve this happy result than the national hook-up. 
Then of course comes our thanks this year to the Notre Dame Club of Cleveland, where President Karl Mar­tersteck. Chairman F. E. Doan and the always loyal legion of Cleveland alumni, sponsored the key meeting about which the broadcast was hinged. Archbishop Schrembs defied illness to participate most graciously. Richard Reid came from Augusta, Georgia, to contribute a beautiful part. Alunrni President O'Connell and Alumnus Senator Worth Clark made the trip from Washington, and President John P. O'Hara, C.S.C, and Toastmaster C. E. "Pat" Manipn came from Notre Dame to Cleveland, to present one of the finest all-Notre Dame programs yet assembled. The Notre Dame angle of the broadcast was fittingly strengthened by picking up the popular Elmer Layden, and the Band and Glee Club • from the campus itself. 
Details of the Cleveland gathering, written by Secretary Al Lawton, ap­pear under Cleveland news in the club section of this issue. 
Special recognition again must go to the local radio stations throughout the country. They responded in both number and generosity in a way which brought Notre Dame programs to each community through the in­
cemed Joe can take over Ted Husing's job any time. 
I was talking with Bob Monahan, '33 for a few minutes. He's living in Worcester, prac­ticing law. Toble Shcchan also came down from that neck of the woods. Joe Glennon, '34 still engaged in the alcohol traffic was there. Patsy Tofuri is doing some sort of social work, and is connected, I believe, with a local Set­tlement House. Andy Scafati is a teacher-coach, in a suburban high school. I had a note from Glynn Frascr lamenting his inability to be present. He's doing Boy Guidance work. He recently had his name in the pajwrs as a win­ner in the M.G.M. picture contest. One hun* dred dollars worth of green paper was his as a reward for his fidelity to dear old H.G3I. 
John and Art McManroon, faithful unto death, were at the meeting and Art walked oft with one full quart of door-prize. IHck Dnnn, one of N.D.*s foremost local representa­tives, was also present. Besides being vice­
timate medium of the local Clubs and local Notre Dame men. 
The club meetings were outstanding this year in numbers in atendance, but more significantly in the type of meeting and the featuring of out­standing guests. More and more the Night is being properly employed to recognize or to interest those leaders in the various communities who have been or who should be friends of Notre Dame. New York, New Jersey, Cincinnati, Detroit, Indianapolis and Chicago come immediately to mind for their leadership in this field this year, besides Cleveland. 
Campus speakers were again in de­mand, and the always popular foot­ball movies were early exhausted by a record demand. 
The Clubs in the Far West were equally active this year, which de­serves special mention, as their co­operation from the campus is neces­sarily limited. 
Already, the -Mumni Office is plan­ning a bigger and better program for nest year -with additional cooperation to the Clubs. The programs of the Clubs are an annual challenge to the Office in initiative and achievement, and this happy rivalry is producing the inevitable progress of the Night each year until it is a most significant institution in the history of both the University and the Assoication. 
president of the Lumberman's Mutual Casualty Insurance Co., and associated companies, he is president of the Catholic Alumni Sodality here in Boston. Many of Boston's most emin­ent business and professional men are mem­bers of this organization, and It is no small distinction that a Notre Dame man is its president. Buck Hanley holds an exalted posi­tion in the local Federal Youth project: he's dean or registrar or something of that sort in the school they conduct. He's studying law nights at B.C. Law, as is Fred Solari.

Secretary Mc&Ianns reported later that Dick Dann marked the Boston observation of TTnf­vcrsal Notre Dame Night with a Notre Dame talk on a local radio station. Complications prevented a club gathering on that night, but plans are in the making for a party later in the spring. 
BUFFALO 
William P. Cass, '32, 233 Capen Blvd.. Pres­ident; Frank J. Cass, '33, 233 Capen Blvd.. Secretary. 
The Notre Dame Alumni Club of Buffalo extends its deepest sympathy to Donald W. Love on the death of his mother on April 13. Don is treasurer of the club. 
The members of the club held a bowling party and meeting on March 21, at which final plans were made for the annual Easter Dance. Lionel V.

On April 4, Henry L. Bums represented the Notre Dame alumni at the annual College Day at East High School in Buffalo and inter\*iewed a number of students who are interested in attending Notre Dame. 

The annual Enster dance was in the Terrace Room of Hotel Statlcr on April 8. with music by Charles Freeman and his N.B.C. orchestra. Parties were held by many members of the club preceding the dance, which was for the benefit of the club Scholarship Fund. Many of the students home from the TTniversity for Easter were seen at the dance. Heads of the various eommittecs were, John C. McKcndry. Jr., reservations: A. Gordon Bennett, recep­tion :John H. Travers, Jr., patrons: Martin J-Travcrs, programs: Henry L. Bums, decora­tions : Hcnrj- E. Weiss, music, and Frank Rcppcnhaficn, campus club representative. The dance was an outstanding social event of the Easter season in Buffalo and was attended not only by local alumni but also by a large num­ber of friends of the University from various parts of the state. 
On April 10. the club held its semi-monthly luncheon at the Touraine Hotel. Among the guests was John Else, MO, home from school for Easter. 
On April 17, President William P. Cass delivered an address over radio station WSVS in Buffalo on the "History of Notre Dame" and explained the significance of Universal Notre Dame Night. 
Following the broadcast the alumni held their annual Universal Notre Dame Night ban­quet in the main dining room of the Hotel Touraine. The list of speakers included the Rev. Henry B. Laudenbach, pastor of St. Louis Church who acted as toastmastcr. George 
M. Wanamaker, president of the Buffalo City Council, spoke on the need of this country for men such as those produced by Notre Dame. Joe Bach, head football coach at Niagara Uni­versity, related some of his experiences as a member of the famous "Seven Mules" of 1924. Jim Britt, sports commentator of Station WBEN, paid a highly eloquent compliment to Notre Dame, which he called the "Ideal Uni­versity." The Very Rev. John M. Noonan, CM., president of Niagara University, deliv­ered the main address, the topic of which was "Catholic E<lucation," 
Preceding the talks, those at the banquet listened to the radio program originating at Notre Dame and Cleveland after which Pres­ident William P. Cass introduced the local speakers. Among the distinguished guests at the speaker's table were. Brother Malachy, president of St. Joseph's Collegiate Institute. Armand Nicholi, member of the Pittsburgh Pirates professional football team, who also played at Duquesne University under the coaching'of Elmer Laydcn and Joe Bach, Ray Ryan of the "Courier Express," and Rev. Morris J. O'Shea of Niagara Falls. N. Y. At the conclusion of the banquet. President Bill Cass expressed his appreaciation to Ed­ward M. O'Connor, Jr., who acted as general chairman of the banquet and also to all the members of the club for their splendid cooper­ation in connection with the many recent ac­tivities. 
Preceding thn banquet, Jim Britt devoted his entire sports program on Station WBEN to Universal Notre Dame Night.

CAPITAL DISTRICT (New York) 
Lawrence T. O'Neill, '34, 393 Elk St.. Albany, President; John F. Campbell, '26, 39 Van Burcn St., Albany, Sccrctarj*. 
President Jack Land climaxed his eventful term of office with the most successful Uni­versal Notre Dame Night the Capital District Club has enjoyed in recent years. 
His tour of personal contact throughout the District, in addition to netting the treasury some few dolars in dues, impressed upon the alumni his seriousness in making the Night one worthy of their attendance. 
Thirty members met at the University Club in Albany on April 17. The national broad­cast was heard and applauded. Dinner was served. Tom Hils said he hadn't tasted such a steak since he left the Dining Hall at school. 
Elections were held. Cris Connolly, the president—apparent, broke up the progressive movement, so the scene was set for a dark-horse. Sir. Lawrence T. O'Neill, formerly known as "Butch," galloped in as president. In fact, if Larry wasn't a hustler, he could have walked in. The progressive swing car­ried Mike Lcding into the vice-presidency-John Campbell has been paying dues and been active in the club for quite some time. Undoubtedly, he has often wondered why others didn't do likewise. He now has his chance to find out; for John is the new secretary-treasurer. 
The Board of Governors now consists of Jack Land. Eddie Eckcrt. Harold Canavan. Cris Connolly, and Joe Bucct, the boy who keeps .Amsterdam Notre Dame conscious. 
About the middle of the evening the old president disappeared. However, promptly at ten Ed Kcncfakc's radio picked up a local program over Station WABY and we, as un­doubtedly did countless others, heard Jack Land and Shcrb Herrick discuss recent devel­opments at the University. Listening to Jack broadcast. I would have sworn that he was 40 years old and o^vned half the banks in New York state. 
Some pictures of last year's Notre Dame-Army game under the projection of Eddie Eckert, formally concluded the evening. 
Guests of the club for the dinner were Father Brown, doing graduate study at RPX , and Brother John Baptist, C.S.C head of the Brothers at Vincentian Institute. Father Ed­ward O'Malley couldn't get away from his parish in Troy. 
The three gents from Glens Falls, Herliby, Burke, and Dwyer, somehow failed to drive down that grand old war horse, C. L. Touhey. Still a number of ardent club boosters and supporters did show up, namely. Jack Hn«ther. John Meehan, Tom DoUzrd, John V. Sml^h, and Ed Grctcfaen. 
Bill Fitzpatrick recently had himself meas-lured for a morning suit. Don't get excited— he is only one of the wedding party. Larry Weiss and Bill Davis spent their spare ume handling glasses and telling Fitz how to be­have. 
Discussion of plans for the summer picnic found Jim Drislane, Walt O'Brien, and Bill Branigan full of ideas. This discussion started a squabble in the Casazza contingent. We all remembered that Bill beat Jack in the shot put contest last summer, but. believe it or not. Jack remembered differently. Mrs. Casazza objected to Jack's throwing the shot put in the parlor, so as soon as spring gets here he intends to go into training. 
The date for the Summer Picnic was set on July 22. Mark your calendar. 
Unforeseen circumstances and foreseen cir­cumstances kept others from the party. Elmo Moycr just got back from an extended trip and had to reacquatnt himself with his fam­ily. Dick Walsh was to present a technical paper before a group of engineers the next day. so had to practice his speech. Dr. John Kaltcux had to be on the job. Dare O'Brien actually had to work. Tom Farley was prac­ticing saying. "I do." Tom is a benedict now. Jack Raincy is still beaming over the recent family addition. 
Eddie Eckcrt has recently built himself a swell home in Loudonville, the swanky suburb of .A.lbany. 
Here's wishing success to the new officers. Let's support them in all our activities. Alike Leding. 
CHICAGO 
James T. Igoc, *32. 328 S. Jefferson. Pres­
ident; John F. Clark, '33, 4733 Washington 
Blvd., Secretary. 
Another month with more and more activ­ities chalked up to the credit of the officers and members of the Chicago Club, under the guidance of President Jim Igoe and his effi­cient chairmen. March 17 marked the celebra­tion of St. Patrick, with an annual lundieon held at the LaSalle Hotel under the chair­manship of Barry O'Keefe. Barry could not think of anybody more appropriate than the Ambassador from Ireland as the guest speaker, namely the Honorable Robert Brennan. A vote of appreciation to him and his committee for the fine work they turned in on this occa­sion. 
The month of March marked the inaugura­tion of a new feature in the curriculum of the Chicago organization, and that was the hand­ball tournament. The handball tournament was proposed, developed and chairmaned by John Doncan. The call for handballers turned 

out 2S singles players and 15 doubles teams, which would do justice to any national meet. The surprisine part of it all in addition to the number of players was the number of spec­tators. Each player brought a couple of friends to watch him shine. After much per­spimtion and sore palms, the following men were awarded cups and medals for their ef­forts. In first 5lace for the singles AI Culver, second place to the chairman, no lesF. John Dorgan, with Ed Mclchione copping the third position. Ed Melchione and John Dorgan cap­tured the doubles championship with Andj* Pilney and Tom Grady the runners-up. Ray McGrath and Bill Kavanaugh took third. The cups and medals were presented Universal Notre Dame Kight- And again the club takes this opportunity of expressing its apprecia­tion to a very eflicicnt ofTtcer and chairman in spite of the fact that it had to buy bim a 
cup. 
April 17 marked the third big event since our last column. It was the misfortune of your secretary to be assigned to the door taking tickets,—and how. Once seated and served, the crowd sat back to be entertained —and how they were entertained!—under the guidance of Arch Ward, toastmastcr. Father Flanagan of the famous Boys Town, ser\*ed as the principal speaker and "Dean" Murphy handled the comedy for the evening. Professor Frank FIjTin, reprepcnting the University, and Harry Stuhldrchcr, head coach at the Univer­sit>- of Wisconsin, were responsible for very entertaining and informative talks. Universal Notre Dame Night far surpassed every expec­tation in the number attending- Tliis was due primarily to the enthusiastic and untiring efforts of Chairman Art Korzcncski and his energetic committee. Seldom before ha*', the 
speaker's table at a Universay Night been 
graced with so many fine speakers and such 
entertainment. 
In conclui^ion,—let's hear from you. Any­
thing. For example, "Whose getting mar­
ried?" "A\Tiose having babies?" Answer to 
the former, John Gorman, Bill Lewis and 
George Brautigam; to the latter, Tony Dun­
ning, Tighc Woods and John Clark.

Ambrose McGinniB, '24. 422 South "£*' St.. Crown Point. Ind., Prcaldent; Fred J. Sol-man. Jr., '28, S752 Erie Axe., Hammond. Ind.. Secretary. 
From Secretary Fred Solman comes word that the club listened to the exhortations of Brother John Wallace, of Calumet City, at its dinner on Universal Notre Dame Night. John discussed the Rockne Memorial Fieldhouse and the Notre Dame Lay Retreat. Two of the illustrious members of the circle had gone south, Fred reports: Tim Galvin was in Geor­gia or thereabouts and Hugh Carroll, the cluVs super-treasurer, had flown the country—on an alleged South American cruise. ' When he re­turns Mr. Carroll will be investigated by the club auditors. 
The club decided to have weekly luncheons in various cities of the Region. President McGinnis appointed the following committees for this activity: Ike Lower, Gar>-; Allen TraWs. East Chicago, "NMiiting, Indiana Har­bor; John Mclvin Kohrbach and Pat Maloncy, Crown Point; Dan Lyndi and Walter Ranh. Hammond and Calumet City. 
Station WHIP. Hammond, cooperated with the club on April 17 in giving time for Notre Dame news and announcements of the dinner.

•34, 922 Ridge Road, N.W., SccrcUir. 
Advance dope from Canton through Bob Strcb made known the club's plan to have a dinner on U.N.D. Night for members and their respective feminine adornments. This was to be followed by a general listening-in on the national broadcast from Cleveland and by an informal program. The local WHBC had gen­erously agreed to give over 15 minutes to the club's use on April 17. 
Bob had some additional items, as follows: "I had a card from Joe Sinkulc. '32, Ypsi­lanti, Michigan, now at Cristobal, Canal Zone, for Ford Motor Company. He's marri<^ and sends regards to the fellows. John Waltz is the proudest of the Massillon group with a fine youngster, as was previously announced in the ALUMNUS. George Maloncy. our sec­retin', is assuming the role of loastmaster for a variety of young men's dinner clubs since he is president of a public speaking class for advanced work in public speaking. .. . William Licscr, now following medicine at Western Reser\-e, was home for Easter. . . . Hugh Corrcll since January 1 has been as­sociated witli the East Ohio Gas Company." 
Incidentally, Bob himself is in the office of the County Treasurer in Canton. 
CINCINNATI 
Joseph S. Morrisscy. '28, 200 E. Front St., President; Donald Dixon, ex. '34, 603 St. Paul Bldg.. Secretary'. Frank Sweeney reports a Universal Night 
extraordinary in Cincinnati. Ford Frick, president of the National League, was the chief speaker. Others on the program were Russell Wilson, former Cincinnati mayor, and Monsignor Quinn, head of the Catholic Youth Organization in the archdio­cese. Magnificent cooperation from the famed WLW enabled the program to go on the air. 
The regular monthly meeting held on Tues­day, April 4. at the club's headquarters, Kem­per Lane Hotel, was one of the best attended and most successful in recent years. Honor­able Dudley Miller Outcalt, judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County, Ohio, and former county prosecutor, addressed the members present, and gave a very interesting account of some of his experiences with the criminal element. 
Joe Maxwell, recently appointed assistant football coach at the University of Cincinnati to replace Hunk Anderson, attended the meet­ing and expressed delight over his new con­nection in this city. 
Botts Crowley returned from his annual tour of the spring training camps in the South and gave very amusing reports on the antics of the bush leaguers who are trying to make the grade in the Big Time. He went out on a limb by definitely predicting that there was no doubt that the Cincinnati Reds would win the National I^eaguc pennant race this year. Bolts will umpire in the International League this season, so that you fellows from Buffalo, Syracuse, etc. had better be sure to take a good look before you throw any pop bottles. 
Joe Morrisscy exhibited little or no excite­ment over the recent birth of his fourth f:hild —a boy. It's an old story with Joe, and he intends to keep on going until he has an entire football team assembled. This last one is called Mike. However, the same cannot be said of Andy Barton who became a father for the first time last month. The strain was so great on Andy that he had to be given a week's leave of absence from his position to recuperate. 
Our. sincerest sympathy is extended to Joe 
May, 1939 

and Bill Kinncary whose mother recently died. Mrs. Kinneary was well-known to many mem­bers of the club, as she took an active inter­est in our welfare, and hep passing is indeed 
a great loss.

CLEVELAND 
Karl £ . Marterateck. *29, Williamson Bldg.. 
President; G. Albert Lawton. *35. 2097 
Wyandotte Ave, Lakewood. Secretary. 
We certainly have a surfeit of material this trip! First in importance are the Uni­versal Notre Dame Night festivities April 17 at the Statler Hotel. The committee, headed by Frank Doan and President Martcr-Bteck, modestly engaged the Euclid Ballroom, planning on a turnout of roughly 300 people, and had to revise their estimate to 500, the final count. The dinner was transferred to the Main Ballroom. Thomas F. Byrne. Roger Brcnnan, Tom Ryan, Clayt Lcroux. A! Sum­mer, and Bob Mazancc certainly can be proud of the job they did. The event attracted city­wide attention, not only among Catholics, but among other sects and alumni groups as well. 
Dinner was ser\-ed at about 7:00 o'clock, and at 8:00 the broadcast, coast to coast, com­menced. Professor Pat Alanion, inimitable. was toastmaster. He was introduced by Prexy Karl, whom, we understand from those who heard the broadcast, has an excellent radio voice. Professor Iklanion outlined the purpose of Universal Notre Dame Night and then introduced Ambrose O'ConncU, a gradu­ate of the class of 1907. and now second as­sistant postmaster general of the United States and president of the national Alumni Association. In a spirited speech Mr. O'Con­noU conveyed the wishes of the national as­sociation to the radio audience at large, and in particular to the students and faculty at the University and to the diners in Cleveland. He then introduced Richard Rcid, outlinging Mr. Hcid's accomplishments—the time on the air being too short to do much else but out­line. 
Rcid. an affable, mild-mannered man, pleaded for world peace, in conformity with the wishes of the Pope. "The world's greatest need," Mr. Rcid affirmed, "is peace: the peace which is the work of justice, and not of paci­fism. Catholic laymen and the men of Notre Dame have no greater social duty than to up­hold His Holiness, Pope Pius XII, in his blessed efforts to effect it. There can be no peace without good will. There can be no peace without Christ. The world cannot re­ject the Saviour of the World and then retain blessings acceptance of Him and His teach­ings bring. To know the peace of Christ, the world must accept the kingship of Christ over the hearts of men." 
After his introduction by Toastmaster Man-ion. Senator D. Worth Clark of Idaho, the second youngest member of the U. S. Senate, and a graduate of the class of 1022, spoke in stirring fashion of the spirit of Notre Dame. Tracing the origin of this spirit to Father Sorin and his confreres. Senator Clark showed its modern application to be Christian gen­tlemanliness. He exhorted his audience to be ever aware of this spirit. 
Mr. Reid was followed by Archbishop Schrembs. introduced by Mr. Manion as the first American officially recognized by the new Pope. The Archbishop chose as his theme, "It is not what is put into a man's head that counts, but what is put into his heart." He referred to Notre Dame as "one of the grandest institutions in America." Un­fortunately Father O'Hara. who was scheduled to broadcast immediately after the archbishop was not able to speak before the allotted half hour had passed. 
That part of the program which orieinated on the campus, viz., Elmer Layden's football predictions and the music of the band and Klee club were broadcast to the banquet hall, so that the 500 diners got the complete picture. 
After the broadcast the dinner and celebra­tion continued with speeches by Father O'Hara and others. Father O'Hara, in an impressive 15-minute discourse, outlined the intellectual accomplishments of the University, telling in particular of the progress which has been and is being made in Physics, Politics, and Economics. Mr. Walter Beam spoke briefly, congratulating the members of the local club on what they are doing for Cleveland in bring­ing both the national broadcast and the Na\'y game to the city. Mr. Beam spoke for the business and industrial enterprises of the city, as executive vice-president of the Cleveland Chamber of Commerce. ' 
The rest of the evening was spent in storj-­telling by Mr. Manion, Senator Clark, and Mr. Rcid. It was about 10 o'clock when the jam at the checkroom started, and the evening had 

•been so thoroughly entertaining that many were surprised to learn of the hour. Alto­gether, your correspondent thinks that the committee deser\'es greater commendation for their splendid work, and in particular Karl Marlcrstcck should be congratulated. But few realize the many, many hours Karl puts into Notre Dame activity. 
The outstanding success of Univers;il Notre Dame Night has almost dwarfed Chairman Dick Prczcbcrs unusually delightful Easter dance at Shaker Tavern the previous Monday. Prez put on a good feed, had a fine orchestra, and an excellent crowd. When Dick told his Mother he was going to Universal Notre Dame Night she warned him not to get mixed up in any more committee work—an indication of how seriously Dick takes his assignments: you know how successfully he executes them. 
Mike Crawford and Tom Ryan conducted the Rocknc Memorial breakfast and did it in fine fashion. Many of the boys brought their Dads along. Mr. Huller, Ralph's pater, and Mr. Roche were seated at our own table and we noticed many others throughout the hall. The Ohio State game pictures from 1935 were shown and ably explained by assistant coach Joe Boland. 
This is commencing to get rather lengthy, and while we haven't scratched the surface we do have to stop sometime. This is our last column. We have had a very successful year from all accounts; most important among cri­teria in measuring the success of any alumni club, we think, is one thing. What is the feel­ing of the members as the officers turn over their chores to their successors, or, stated an­other w-ay, how much factionalism has been generated during the year? In the answer to this lies the answer to Karl Martersteck's un­usual success. We think that the club has never been more closely knit, and never have all pulled together as consistently and as fruit­fully. On behalf of all the members of the organization we thank Karl Martcrsteck most profusely for all he has done, and our thanks are quite inadequate.

DAYTON 
Gaylord P. Haas, '29. 17 E. Bruce Ave.. President; WilUam L. Struck, '36, 708 Winters Bank BIdg.. Secretary. 

Universal Notre Dame Night brought the fellows out for another grand evening. The get-together of the Dayton contingent to cel­ebrate the occasion took place at the Miami Hotel. Refreshments were ser\*ed and the broadcast was listened to, and movies of the Notre Dame-Kansas football game were shown. Professor Brown and 16 Notre Dame students from the aeronautical division of the engi­neering college were welcome visitors and gave us last minute news of Notre Dame ac­tivity. 
Two recent arrivals to the Gem City became members of the local organization at this meeting: Frank Mayer, B.S. in A.E, '38, from Chicago and now an aeronautical engineer with Wright Field, and Urban Daly, B.S. in Ch.E; '37, from Pittsburgh and now with General Motors Corporation. 
Others present were: Andrew Aman, '30, Harr>- C. Baujan, '17, E. W. Bauman, '02, Judge H. L. Fcmcding, '9G, Gaylord P. Haas. '29, J- FarrcU Johnston, '24, Eugene A. May]. '2-1. W. Edmund Shea, '23. William L. Struck. '36, '37, and James L. Trant. '20. 
With the retirement from office oE the of­ficers of the Dayton Club the annual election of officers was hold and the following officers elected: Gaylord P. Haas, president, and William L. Struck, secretary. Plans were also discussed for future events.

A clipping from a local paper, sent by President Krajewski. tells the impressive storj­of Universal Night in Dubuque: 
"Dubuque Members of the Notre Dame Alumni organization joined with alumni groups all over the country in the obser\*ance of Universal Notre Dame night Monday night. Local members participated in a dinner, meet­ing and broadcast from Tschudi's, Durango.

This year's Universal Notre Dame Night marked another move in the right direction for the Denver unit. A dinner meeting was called so that the boys could listen in to the national broadcast from the campus and Cleveland. In attendance we had one of the largest - groups that we have ever had and many new men who are now in this locality came to join ns. We had 37 men: Louis HOIIKII, Robert Dick, Ed Mansfield, A! O'Heara, Dr. Rene Sodrlqvez. Edmond J. Riley, Bill Dick, Daniel J. Pflannt. Leon Ardier, Edward J. Gcbben John T. Shechan, 
A. L. .Do«ds, Dan Monasfaan. Jim Hanlon,. Chack Cassidy, Herb Fairall, Jack Akolt. Jim Logan, Russell Sabo, Al Frantz, Tom Tiemey, Bart CHan . Ray Smith, Charles Smith* Geonce .Starbnck, Loo Finske, Dr. Henry J. Dillon. J. R. Stevens, John Humphreys, Gene Blish, Joe McCarty, John MeCarty, Fred Gusharst. Joe Myers, Jack Cndmore, and Frank McGoagh. Oh yes, and yours truly. 
We had a charter drawn up so that the club would function in businesslike manner and this charter called for election of officers starting at this meeting and taking place once a year. Our old friend and loyal member,. James P. Locan, was elected our new presi­dent without competition. Then for vice-president the choice was Fred Gushurst, who was also installed without dissent. For secre­tary. Charles Cassidy, one of the new mem­bers, was chosen to take on the duties of that office. For treasurer, Harry Lawrence. Jim Hanlon was selected as one director to repre­sent his period of connection vnih the Uni­versity, Bob Dick was second, to represent the following years, and Ed Slansfield was chosen to represent the late years, so that the board is made up of men from all periods of attend­ance. The president and secretary are also directors. 
One of the highlights of the evening was-the appearance of one Jerome Matthews, of the class.of '74, who came down to extend his greetings to the rest of the hoys. He gave us a few remarks concerning the University when he was there with only 600 other stu­dents and Father Serin was his main memory. He is 86 years old and we feel we have the distinction of having in our midst one of the oldest, if not "the" oldest, living graduate. 
Another plan carried through at this meet­ing was to have two Communion days a year for the members. One on Rock's anniversary and the other time to be announced at a later date.

It was the unanimous opinion of the 75 present that Notre Dame Club of Detroit par­ticipation in Universal Notre Dame Night was very successful and satisfying. It was held in the main dining room of University Qub. 
We were all very grateful to the University for sending Joe Boland as its representative. Although he needed no introduction, the for­malities were taken care of by his classmate and fellow^ linesman. Bud Boeringer, who is line coach at University of Detroit. Joe gave us an interesting resume of University back­ground, scholastically and athleUcally. He-showed pictures of last fall's Carnegie Tech game. 
President Howard Becchinor presided, of course, and presented Frank Nolan, quite a noted story teller who was very amusing. Gns Dorais brought Bfalcolm Bingay, who is man­aging editor of the "Detroit Free Press." Al Ryan introduced Mr.' Bingay (noted for his "Iffy, the Dojwster" stories), who gave a very fine tallc He had been the guest of Father Hugh O'DonneU at the Came^e Tech game last Fall and was very much impressed with the Univerrfty. 

The reception was excellent for the broad­cast over NBC between 8 and 8:30, though we were disappointed that Father 0*Hara was not on the air during that haU-hour period. 
The old regulars all attended the affair, in­cluding the ever-faithful Van Wallace and his father, Gil Schacfer, Jim Forcn, Art Cronin* Line Wnrzcr, John Annas, Matt Garrigan, John Brennan. Paul Doolcy and Larry Gemon, 
a. most faithful, if syntheic, alumnus who has been sending his monthly contribution to tlie ]Rockne Memorial Fund. 
I have been glad to see the more recent alumni attending, including Jew Bloorc, Don Currier, Tim Cruicc, Jack Zimmers and Tom Moran and many- others. 
Gil Schacfer has a new daughter, bom March 18. 
The engagement has been announced of John Annas to the daughter of John E. Moore. Bob Powell will be married April 22 to Miss Donna Richardson. Jay L. (Biffy) Lee an­nounces the engagement of his daughter, Mary Elizabeth, who will be married May 30 to David D. Merriman.

Mr. Reilly recalled some of his cxi)eriences in South America ^vith Father O'Hara, and said that the word Uni­versal w^as particularly applicable to Notre Dame as he found Notre Dame men just as actively enthusiastic in every country they visited. 
A rousing truhute was paid to Art Shea by all who attended the dinner for the fine job he has done this past year. It was agreed he has been one of the best presidents this club has ever had.

Some 25 men gathered and after an enjoyable dinner, tuned in the various Universal Notre Dame Night ceremonies which were broadcast. Particular interest was taken in the words spoken by Coach Elmer Laydcn and by the Rev. Edward J. Flanagan of Boys Town, Nebraska, the latter from the banquet of the Chicago Notre Dame Club. 
At the conclusion of these ceremonies, the matter of reviving or reorganizing the Val­ley organization was discussed, and it was voted by the members present that the ofTi­cial name should be "The Illinois Fox Valley Club of Notre Dame."

Larry EnriKht, now assistant sales manager • of the Dictaphone Corporation at Chicago, 
joined us at our St Pat's party. Both Reedy

B. Dunn, an attorney at Morris. Illinois, was unable to join us at our party inasmuch as both bad roomed \nth Tom some time or other during their sojourn at school. 
Joe Adier, president and treasurer of the 
Adler Roofing Company, received a nice

We had the pleasure of meeting socially as a Notre Dame Club recently with the Big Ten Club of Memphis, which sponsored a tremen­dous party under the title of "College Nite" at the new Skyway of the Peabody Hotel here in Memphis. Each university of the Big Ten, as well as Notre Dame, had a large table reser\'ed for its members. Each university sang its songs and otherwise enjoyed the occa­sion. 
Some of the universities produced short skits, and I am proud to tell you that our skit captured the honors of the evening. Jerry Foley and Austin Hall had a brainstorm dur­ing the evening, and secured a large banner with the words, "Fij^ting Irish" inscribed 
The Noire Dame Alumnus 
across its face, and a parade of Notre Dame men was then started through the Skyway. 
We have splendid cooperation with the Big Ten Club here in Memphis. They support everything that we attempt to do, and we do the same for them. They rather refer to us here as the eleventh member of the Big Ten. 
It is my pleasure to report a successful ob­
ser\-ance of Universal Notre Dame Night. 
The local papers gave us considerable pub­
licity prior to our meeting, and we believe 
that we had the happiest time that our club 
has enjoyed in many a day. 
About half of the club was present for the dinner at the University Club at 6:30. At 7, of course, we listened to the broadcast from the campus at Cleveland, and we feel that the committee on arrangements is to be con­gratulated for the fine coast-to-coast program. At 8:30, AVMPS, one of our local radio sta­tions, gave us 15 minutes on the air, and we gave a program highly complimentary to the Universib*. The nature of the program was a round-table discussion of all the affairs of the Universitj*. Participants in the round-table discussion were Hugh Slagcvney, Stnria Ca­nale, Jerry Foley, John Montcdonico and my­self. We received a lot of fan mail, being dubbed the Floradora Quintet, etc. 
This particular program was so well re­ceived that we propose, in the near future, to have other programs relating to the affairs of the University. It seems to me that it is well that the clubs throughout the United States follow this precedent. 
A business meeting was held also at the University Club, and a report was made as to the Rockne Memorial Fund, and while our quota was not raised, in comparison with clubs in the United States that have larger numbers of members than we have, we are gratified to see that our report was much better than a number of others. 
Wc are proposing to have a picnic for the 
students at Notre Dame from Memphis, as 
soon as the holidays begin. Mark Beatns, our 
oldest living alumnus, is planning a trip back 
to Notre Dame for Commencement, and it 
seems that he is going to take a number of 
our boys with him.

With president Charies E. de la Verxne presiding, toastmaster Fabian N.

Rev. J. J. Qninlan. C.S.C., spoke on "The Congregation of Holy Cross and the Founding of the University of Notre Dame du Lac," telling of the congregation's inception in France, its members' arrival, in the United States, and their coming to the Log Chapel in which Father Badin had held services for the Pottawatomie Indians. 
Patrick £. Borke, our honorary president, introduced as the campus cut-up of 1SS8, re­called the days when students rode out to the University in low-neck hacks and rarely saw South Bend thereafter. 
Early athletics at Notre Dame was the topic of Joe Dohan, pitcher on the famous baseball teams of 1901-02, who recalled, among big league reminiscences, that Ed Rnelbach. na­tional league' star who pitched a no-hit game for the Chicago Cubs in 1906, could not make the Notre Dame staff in 1902. 
Cyprian A. Sporl. Jr.. stepped in for Joseph val Le Blanc, our vice-president, who was un­able to come, in stories of ''Rockne. the play­er," and Larry Mollins. head coach at Loyola University of the South, gave anecdotes of "Rockne, the coach." "Moon" rendered the opinion that "the toughest football in America is played on the Notre Dame freshman team," and confessed his worst moment was the time Dan Hanley caught him and Backy O'Connor crying during Rockne's talk' before the 1930 Southern California game. 
K?v. Leonard Carrico. CS.C., director of studies at the University, here for a short vacation, delivered the invocation at the din­ner. 
The club elected Father Qninlan its chap­lain, and named Fred Digby, Sr., William G. Rankin and Lionel J. Favret to associate mem­bership. The latter three are fathers of Notre Dame studentsor graduates. 
President de la Vergne exhibited a silver trophy given in 18S8 to C C.

The Notre Dame Club of New York City celebrated Universal Notre Dame Night on Monday. April 17, by staging an old-fashioned 

beefsteak dinner party at the Aldine Club at 200 Hfth Avenue, Tables were arranged by classes and the affair proved to be one rousing get-together like those famous old **bull ses­sions" in Sorin or Walsh Hall. All those who attended were tendered a cap and apron with their name and doss printed en it and as a result it didn't take long for old friends to renew acquaintances. Guests and speakers in­cluded Joseph P. Grace, LL.D.. '37, chairman of the board of W. U. Grace & Co.; J. V. Connolly, general manager of Hearst Publica­tions; Major Allen Smith of the Worid's Fair stair; and F. B. McDaniel. executive from Anheuser-Busch, Inc. Added features were three larruping boxing contests between CYO leather pushers and some community singing. In honor of the day the club also arranged a series of five radio broadcasts on as many stations at various times to give special news and features about Universal Kotro Dame Jfight. One of the evening programs embraced a special broadcast from the World's Fair Building over station WWRL. 
More than 200 Notre Dame alumni, their fathers and friends, attended the Communion and Breakfast on Sunday, March 25, in memor>- of Knutc Rockne. Mass was cele­brated in Our Lady Chapel of St. Patrick's Cathedral by Msgr. Casey and breakfast was ser\-ed later at the Xew York A, C. Among the guests and speakers were Grattan Stan­ford, lay trustee of the University; Rev. E, Roberts Moore of St, Peter's Church who gave an interesting account of the work being done in New York by the Catholic Youth Organization; Judge Donnelley: and our old friend Jimmy Crowley, football mentor at Fordham, who entertained the enthusiastic au­
•dience with stories of the Old Master. 
Continuing in its efforts to build up the Notre Dame Club of New York into a lively Catholic Action group and to give the city*s millions of inhabitants a clearer impression of what Notre Dame stands for and what its men are doing, the club has just completed negotiations with station WWRL in Wood­side to put on the air a sustained half-hour weekly program for 13 consecutive weeks. Ed Cunningham. '2S, has been placed in charge of the Radio Development Committee which is now busily engaged in formulating the complete series of broadcasts. A number of alumni have already volunteered their talents and preliminary' plans call for a varied pro­gram that will include music, short plays or skits, dramatized shorts bearing on interesting facts about Notre Dame and its history, and news of Notre Dame and Catholic Action throughout the world. The first of these pro­grams will be aired within a few weeks. 
The "Weaponds"—that lively organization of writers, editors, advertisers and publishers of Notre Dame—an affiliate of the Notre Dame club itself and which was formed in the late fall of 1937 continued its regular program of monthly dinner meetings ^vith a well attended affair on Thursday night, March 30 in the private dining room of "The New York limes." The feature of the evening was a highly in­formative talk by E, P. H. James, advertising director of the National Broadcasting Com­pany, who spoke on the development of radio script writing, dialogue, commercial announce­ments, and the place of television in the fu­ture of radio broadcasts. Prominent among the guests was Rev. Iheophaine McGuire, Editor of "The Sign."

Kecne Fitzpatrick, chairman of the club's Rockne Memorial Retreat Committee, sent this inspiring word on April 4: 
"Thirty Rockne admirers and membcra of the Notre Dame alumni of Northern Califor­nia made their second annual Rockne Memorial Retreat at the Jesuit Retreat House in Los Altos. California, from Thursday. March 30, to Monday, April 3. All were tremendously impressed with the inspirational and spiritual exercises. As you will note by the above dates, this Retreat extended over a period of approximately three and one-half days, during which time almost total silence and meditation was seriously observed. Because of. the en­thusiastic reception of the retreatants, this movement is growing in popularity and the requests for invitations to attend are increas­ing each year. . . . 
"I am returning your Rockne fight film under separate cover. We used this together with 100 feet of film of the highspots of Rockne's life, which I own; hence the Retreat concluded on a high note." 
The picture of the retreatants together with 
their names appear elsewhere on this page. 
The Administration of the University and 
the Alumni Office receive w*ith a particularly 
warm feeling the news of Notre Dame Re­
treats on the Pacific Coast, where • Notre 
Dame men are relatively few and the per­
sonal touch with campus activities is largely 

missing. The real spirit of Notre Dame can. 
at long range, be kept burning effectively in 
no better way. 

Particular gratitude goes to Kcene Fitzpat­rick who conceived the idea of the Rockne Retreat of the Northern California Club and who has been its able leader ever since.

The Peoria Club held its Universal Notre Dame Night banquet at the Jefferson Hotel. Peoria. The 150 that attended included practi­cally all the alumni from Peoria and the sur­rounding towns together with those who at­tended the Retreat every summer, and many, who though they never attended Notre Dame, arc alumni in spirit at least. 
Father Hugh O'Donncll, vice-president of the University, gave a very serious and interest­ing speech, that was punctuated w*ith humor. Father Charles Williams of Piper City, Illinois, who was at one time stationed in Peoria and was a student at Notre Dame with Father O'Donnell, introduced the speaker of the eve­ning. Mayor Dave McCluggagc in a brief address welcomed Father O'Donnell to Peoria. 
A\*hile the immediate success of the evening was due to the speaker, the plans, arrange­ments and those hidden things that are neces­sary in advance of an evening of that kind, were handled by Bill Motsett, the president. Frank Obcrkocttcr, who acted as chairman and toastmaster, Al Gury, the chairman of the ticket committee, and Spaul Slcvin. the chairman of the entertainment committee.

Last night we had the largest attendance yet at Universal Notre Dame Night. Fifty-fiire members of the Rochester Alumni came to the dinner at the Rochester Club and several oth­ers dropped in later. 
The program started in the afternoon with talks by John Dorschcl and Judge Harold Burke on Stations "\\'HAM and "WHEO re­spectively. They answered questions concern­ing campus life and traditions at Notre Dame. 
After dinner we* received the latest report on the Rochester Red Wings from Lowell Mac­Millan, local sportscaster, who had just re­turned from the Red Wing baseball camp. 
Following this Judge Harold Burke favored us with another talk'about Old St. Joe Hall and incidents in the lives of Brother Florian, Brother 3Iatthias. and Brother Leopold. Ev­eryone looks forward to Harold's stories every time he attends our dinners. 
The highlight of the evening was an address by the Rev. George Kettell, pastor of Old St. Mary's Church and a loyal supporter of Notre Dame. Father Kettel, a war chaplain, warned us to "beware of the war minded propagand­ists who are trying to get the United States into war." His stirring speech will long be remembered by those of us who were present.

ECONOMICS STUDY 
(Continued £rom Fase 173) 

ment data (latest complete figures available) found that the nation's physical assets totalled 410 billion dollars in value. Of this total, 54% consists of 'comfort goods,' -which in­cludes farm and city homes, automo­biles, property reserved for municij>al or educational uses, and similar things -which no restricted body of citizens could conceivably o-wn or uti­lize. To illustrate, over fourteen mil­lion, or nearly half, of the nation's 29,905,000 families live in homes which they own. 
"An additional ten percent of the total physical assets is used as tools of production' by farmers; and four percent is owned by professional and business men for 'production.' Al­though title to the remaining 32% of the nation's physical assets is vested in corporations. Father Keller claims that the o\vnership of at least a third of these assets cannot represent con­centration, being scattered very -wide­ly among the citizens of the country in individual holdings of stock, and is further distributed by equities -which millions of citizens hold through life insurance policies and bank deposit receipts. 
"The study shows further that, on a per capita basis, the value of the nation's physical assets in 1933 -was approximately §2,740 per person. Of this araoimt, $1,233 represented o-wn­ership of production assets, and $1,507 represented possession of comfort goods. 
"Using statistics to demonstrate such commonly accepted truths as that the people of the United States own about 75 percent of all automo­biles in the -ivorld, about 80 percent of all telephones and household ap­pliances, and that this is the only country -where a majority of homes have radios, running water, bath -tubs, central heating, etc.. Father Keller points to the following figures to show that -within the country there is a wide diffusion of ownership of phy­sical assets used for comfort. 
"He shows, for example, that de­spite the intervening years of depres­sion 'comfort' goods increased from a value of $121,528,000,000 in 1922 to $138,138,000,000 in 1933. Physical as­sets, used for 'tools of production' in­creased from a value of $85,026,000­000 in 1922 to $102,671,000,000 in 1933. 
"He further supports his de-concen­tration theory with the fact that in a year when there were 29,905,074 fam­ilies in the country, there were 23 million owned passenger cars (multi­
May, 1939 
ple ownership in a few cases would not affect the broad conclusion). Also there were 19 million electric (not battery) radios. 
Father Keller's volume is on sale at the Notre Dame Book Store in cloth bound copies at $1.00 and in paper at fifty cents. 
UNIVERSITY AFFAIRS 

(Continued from Page 174) together with Zahm and Cavanaugh Halls, erected within the last two years, will comprise a Freshman Quadrangle in the northeast section of the campus. Funds for the new hall were pro­-vided by the late William P. Breen, '77, and Frank J. Phillips, '80, Fort Wayne, Indiana bankers. Named as residuary legatee of the estates of Mr. Phillips and Mr. Breen, the Uni­versity received bequests amounting to $400,000 on the death of Mrs. Breen, a sister of Mr. Phillips. In addition to its residence facili­ties, the new hall, which will be adja­cent to the University gymnasium, -will provide new quarters for the offices of the University athletic asso­ciation in one wing of the ground floor. 
The firm of Maginnis and Walsh, the Universit}' architects, of Boston, designed the structure, which will be ready for occupancy at the opening of the schoolyear next September. 
Thomas L. Hickey of South Bend is the general contractor. Virtually all the rooms in the new hall are designed for double occupancy, -with a consequent reduction in li-ving costs for first-year students. 
1939-40 SLATES (Ckintinued from Page 175) 

in the national Association. A lead­ing attorney, he has brought great credit to Notre Dame in that field, and his alumni interest has been of a most cultural and constructive type. 
JOHN T. HIGGINS-^ack Higgins, Detroit attorney, has been a rising star in the Detroit area. He served as president of the Club there and has since been in the forefront of its growing program of outstanding ac­tivities. Such is the close weave of the N. D. pattern, that John is asso­ciated with the law firm of Wurzer & Wurzer, long a Notre Dame strong­hold. 
Such is the national slate for 1939­

40. As the voice of the Alumni, and especially the Alumni Office, the ALUMNUS goes on record as saying that the prospects for continuing and increasing the prestige of the Associ­ation are bound to rest in good hands, whatever the halloting may bring to light on the night of June 3.

Friday night, in the Lay Faculty Dining Room, the Silver Jubilee Reunion Dinner will be held. (Col. Clements reports that a special refreshment fund has remained intact during eight years, a real feat of investment and per­sonal fortitude.) 
Saturday, the Class will attend the dedica­tion of the Rockne Memorial, which is of course shared by '14 as by no other group. 
C. E. "Gus" Dorais will be one of the prin­cipal speakers. The Class will sit at special tables of honor at the alumni banquet sub­sequently. 
Sunday morning, a special Mass will be said in the hall chapel at 8:30. followed by breakfast, and by a pilgrimage to Rock's grave. 
That's the skeleton, boys, as the Colonel puts it. It's up to you to supply the flesh. 
Frank Hayes and Ray Miller arc among the early registrants. Let Walter know if you are coming so that he can bake enough f:akes. His office is in the Building & Loan Tower, South Bend.

20-YEAR REUNION June 2, 3 and 4 

C W. "Chick" Badcr was on deck on April 29 for the annual Spring football game. 
Prof. Paul Fcnion is almost a daily contact in the caf. 
If you think those two items are unrelated, as you perhaps do, it is because you have ob­\*iousIy forgotten tJie 20-Year Reunion. 
Chick and Paul both landed on the Editor like a Dewey investigation. And while we subtly replied that '19 is "their" Class, not ours, they assumed a sort of quizzical, far­away look, as if 20 years had brought some doubt. 
AVhile you are making arrangements to come out June 2, 3 and 4, drop Chick or Paul a note, will you, so that they can make the necessary arrangements, and get their morale back.

15-YEAR REUNION June 2, 5 and 4 

Local Chnirmnn Bob Riordan has this latest promotion literature for you reffarding your 15-year reunion: 
"You've heard the story* about (name de­leted) firiuff his elephant Bun from the roof of Bndin at Brother Leo's hoRs: well, the hogs are still taking blue ribbons at the Chicaeo stock shows, but elephant guns have given way to golf clubs on what w-as the alfalfa pasture. Instead of skiving out the Dore road, the present generation is swimming on that site in the new Rocknc memorial building pool. The dining halls loom where resided the bray­ing Jack. 
"The old infirmary, pleasantly (in retro­spect) associated with calomel and iodine, has just gone the way of all brick and mortar. Breen-Phillips Hall—well. youMl just have to come see for yourself. You'll recognize the Old Quad and we'll have guides to show you the rest of the way. Father Hugh O'Donncll, vice-president of the University, with his cus­tomary kind forethought, has arranged for us to live in Lyons Hall. That hall is new since our time, but Father Tom Kelly, '24, is in charge, so we'll feel at home. 
"Tentatively, our program is as follows (see elsewhere in this ALUSINTJS for the general program): 
"Informal gatherings, Friday evening: Mass in Lyons chapel, Saturday morning. Father Kelly officiating; buffet luncheon, Saturday noon, in the Faculty Dining Room; attend as group, dedication of the Rockne Memorial, 
4:30 P.M.. Saturday; special tables. Alumni banquet, Saturday evening; golf, swimming, or what you will, as you will. 
"Advance notice that you are coming will help us here in mailing things run smoothly for you who return from afar. But, don't hesitate to come even though you haven't warned us ; the surprise will bo enjoyed."

192 5 Secretary: John P. Hurley, 208S **'^*' Brookdale Road, Toledo, Ohio. 
192 6 Sccrctar>-: James A. Ronan, 127 N. Dearborn St.. Chicago, Illinois. 
Ed Gcbben, the class' G-man, is now chief of the FBI office in Denver after excellent service in other cities. Ed as a representative of the Denver Club spoke on KFEL, Denver, on Universal Notre Dame Night. 
Dr. Bert CouRhlin. 1139 Belle\-ue Avenue, sends welcome word from St. Louis: "Bcmie Crowley, '28, and myself have offices together and would be glad to see any alumni that come our way. He takes care of the tusks and I take care of their diseases. 
"We have quite a medical line-up here in St. Louis: Fran Kennedy, Nig Kcnncds*, Malt Wcis, Bill McGuirc, Fabian Burke, Vince Gorilla, Jack Eimer, Dan Sexton; and se\*eral others. 
• "I am continually in contact with some of the medical students from school as I am on the faculty at St. Louis University, being an assistant in surgery. Most of the N. D. men are all staff members of St. John's Hospital here also, so we see each other daily. Nig Kennedy and myself are also associated with Dr. Robert Hyland, the surgeon for the American and National baseball leagues, so we keep up with the national pastime. . . . 
"Saw Dan Brady last summer and this win­ter I saw Harry O'Boyle, who is now located here with Chevrolet. "Where is 'Wa' Kane, '26, located? I have a date to meet him at a medical meeting some time in the 1930's/' 
(Tlie Alumni Office address for Dr. John 'Worden Kane is IG Park Street, Johnson City, New York.) 
192 7 Secretary-: Joseph M. Boland, Athletic Office. Notre Dame, Ind. 
Joe Boland stole time from spring practice to author this: 
"It's been some time since this stint was done by the undersigned, with a tremendous amount of that aqua having flowed under the bridge. On a recent visit to Cleveland, we caught up with Pat Canny, still in the legal department of the Erie Railroad; John Butler, pursuing the criminally-inclined of his fair city ivith vim and vigor from the Prosecutor's Office; Jack Rcidy, who has retained his fig­ure and still-youthful appearance, as long as he keeps his hat on! But then, who am I to talk ? The grass is pretty thin on my own in­field! Ray (Bucky) Dahman. still in the steel business, is now living and laboring in Cleve-' land, as ho has for the past several years since leaving Youngstown, the old home. And Benny McAdams, now associated with A. and 
P. stores, is headquartering in Cleveland, but connections unfortunately were not made with the old down-easter on that visit 
"From Detroit, still another port-of-call of the Sec, Arthur (Bud) Bocringer was checked in, along with that swell warrior, Dave Van U'allace, who plans a trip to Lourdcs this summer if the present plans of the Detroit Club go through. And knowing that gang in Detroit, Van is as good as there. He's a reg­ular attendant, by the way, at Detroit Club meetings, coming to them on his specially de­signed cot and in a special ambulance car; and for all of the Detroit Club's activities, a ivarm supporter is found in Van Wallace. From his bed. with only telephone contact, he raised a substantial amount for the Rockne Memorial Fund and, in general, put his breth­ren to a steady pace to even stay up with him in all of his alumni activities. George Gucttlcr was checked on our '27 list, still hale and hearty and still chuckling over the ma­neuver that puts yours truly to this task of secretarial scrivening. He promised news from Detroit for this column, however, so we still have that hanging over him! Lou Conroy, whom we had hoped to see, is now located in Flint. Michigan, with a top job in Bell Telephone. 
"Joe Maxwell, many of you may not know, recently signed a contract to coach the line for Cincinnati U,. and has already taken up his duties on the new job. We know many '27 members will now add Cincinnati to that list of names they look for in the scores each Saturday, and hope that all of them are on the right side of the ledger. 
"Other than the above, and rcaliung that this is a scanty and rapid over\-iew, we sign off hoping for bigger and better news."—J.B. 
Ed 3IcDcrmott, a senior this year, brought in the word recently that brothers Gladstone, '27, and Jim, '30> are working with their father m the construction business in Grand Rapids. 
The "Chicago Tribnne" carried word just lately that Loots La Mair had been elected to the presidency of Lyon & Healy, Inc., Chi­cago, nationally famous music house. Louie has been associated with the organization since 1925 when he became paymaster. In January, 1927, he was made head of the accounting department and in 1929, manager of the general offices. He was elected vice-president and general manager on January 1. 1033. Soon after, Lyon & Healy engaged in an expansion program which included the opening of branch stores in several cities from New York to Los Angeles. 
Louie was at Notre Dame for the year 1923-2-i. 

192 8 Secretary Loais F. Buckley. 1965 **'*' " Biltmore St . N.W., Washington. B.C. 
The guest conductor. Dr. Andy Boyle, brewed this for you over in the Chemistry Building: 
"The secretary of the class, Buckley, ap­peared on the campus for a brief visit on April 17. Most of Ws time on the campus was spent in relating stories concerning Bill Jones, '28. Bill has been asked by the man­agement of the apartment house to stop laugh­ing or to look for another apartment. 
"Buckley acknowledges a letter from one of the lost sheep. Bill Dwycr. Bill writes: 
" 'I've been one of the burghers of Milwau­kee for the past three years. • Occupation: grinding out advertising for Line Material Company, manufacturers of electric power equipment. Have been happily married for a year and a half and have gained 20 pounds on more new recipes than you could shake a stick at.' 
" 'Only '28 man I've heard ^rom directly for a long time is John Carlin. Saw Bob Vogle­wede in Chicago on Easter Sunday. It's Rob­ert B., senior, now. Robert B., junior, arrived March 29. This was 11 days after the big event and Bob had almost, hut not quite, re­gained that classic composure.' 
" 'Other N.D. fellows, I hear about ocoi­sionally are: Stock Broker George Conry. who must be worth two million by now; Jim Allen, with an industrial insurance firm; Tom Med-land, traveling hither and yon for a Chicago architectural firm; I>arry O'Connor, merchan­dising for Sears-Roebuck and rumored to be going off the deep end with an Elmhurst, Illi­nois, girl next June: Leo Lynn, another Sears-Roebuck man in Evansville, Indiana; Tom Ryan, a Chicago advertising man.* 
" 'I'd like to hear of such '2Ser3 and •29cr3 as: John Patrick Murphy, Conley T. Murphy. John Leitzingcr,. Vince Dncey, Frank Mc­Carthy, Jim Bochning. Ed Rafter. Bill Goe­litz, Tom Traughbcr, AI Tehan. Jim Conmey, Larry CnUiney, Gas SlacDonald, Frank Con­ners, John Rowland, Loaie Sinclair, Bob Ward, etc., etc.* 
"In answer to Bill, the guest writer for this month will give all the information concerning the above, that is available: 
"Louie Sinclair, a reporter on one of the Battle Creek papers. He puts in an appear­ance on the campus regularly during the foot­ball season. Bob Ward, a practicing lawyer in the old home town of Marshall, Michigan. He generally uses the extra ticket for the foot­
ball games, which Sinclair rates as a reporter. Lany Culliney, still in New York, but a visi­tor at the reunion held last June. 
"Jim CuIIen, the old roommate, has just re­turned from his honeymoon. Jim was married to Miss Helen Scanlon, in Sayrc, Pennsylvania, on February 20. He is practicing law in Sayre and will receive congratulations from the writer in the near future. Weldon Ford, now a ALD., is or was located in. Grand Forks, North Dakota. Sam Romano, also an M.D., is .located in New Orleans, Louisiana. Bill Alahin, employed as research metallurgist for the Westingbouse Corporation, will address the Notre Dame Chapter of the Society for Metals early in May. Bill has been doing some grand work and we are looking for%vard to his visit. 
"Ed Conlin, also an M.D., was last heard from at the Clinic in Chicago. Georee O'Brien, was formerly in Mishawaka, but is now lo­cated in Seymour, Indiana. Pete Gallagher is teaching school in Freeland. Pennsylvania. 
"This about sums up all of the news that is available as far as your guest writer is con­cerned. The science and pre-med men of the class of '28 did not respond to the appeal made by the secretary." 
•\Vhat with a two-weeks' leave in the South Bend - Galesburg sector at Easter, Buckley didn't have time to write a personal message for you this time. He did send word, though, that he'd like George Coury to round up all the '28 news at Commencement and send it through to the ALUMNUS for the June issue. That means, George, that we ought to have your scandal not later than June 10. 
The old economics maestro himself for the first time in many a moon won't be on hand for the June festivities. He wants all the '28 lads to enjoy themselves, anyway, and to lend large encouragement to the youngsters of '29 who will be celebrating their "tenth" this year. Under the baton of that seasoned campaigner, Willard Wagner, and others the '29ers will have much the same sort of Sat­urday night party that "Wag and Andy Boyle engineered so successfully last year. See ad­joining column for details.

XO-YEAR REUNION June 2, 3 and 4 

Beneath the calm exterior of the St. Joseph Valley there rumbles that volcanic substance known aE the Local Committee of the 10-Year Reunion. The eruption on June 2, 3 and 4, promises to outdo all other Ten-Spots by a wide margin. Willard Wagner, who warmed up last year with '28 Class, Fmnds Jones, Jim Keating. Andy Boyle, and the rest of the Cataclysm Class are preparing the arenas, the barbecue pits and other essentials. 
In substance the program wil read a bit like this: 
Friday—Registration, Alumni Office, prob­ably quarters in Morrissey Hall, but that de­tail to be determined. The Class will live together in harmony, with a Class headquar­ters assigned for more ready contact. Golf, swimming, tennis, and indoor sports will occu­py the day, along with the other features of the Commencement week-end. 
Saturday morning at 11. the 10-Year Class will take on the 5-Year Class in a softball game. A suitable trophy is being sought, probably a rare and invaluable relic from the late Infirmary, to make this annual event a real tradition. 
Saturday evening, after the Rockne Me­morial Dedication, the Class eats in a body at the Alumni Banquet. 
THEN—"piece de resistance," as some of your committee put it, plans are being made for the now famous 10-Year Smoker, to be held this year in the Brownson Hall Rec, in the ground floor of Washington Hall. 
A special Mass for the Class, Sunday morn­ing, will round out a week-end of whidi the above are only the barest outlines. Even aside from the Class program the week-end is full of interesting events for all alumni. 
The major point of emphasis is, be here. 

193 0 Secretary: Robert Hellnnr. BuBi­A^^v boldt BIdg., St. Louis, Hlnoari. 
From Johnny Moran, '36, comes word that Tony Fraino joined Moran recently in squad work for the Internal Revenue Department in > ov.- York City.

193 1 Secretary: John Bervan, 838 B. Col­fax Ave., Sooth Bend. Ind. 
Dope and more doi>e from John Bergan: 
"Plans are now under way for the eighth annual informal reunion of the class on Fri­day evening. June 2. in the German Village, Center Street, South Bend. Jerry Crowley is general chairman of the affair this year and is being ably assisted by Judge Frank Kopin­ski. Professor Jim Kearney, John Hclntyre. Clarence Futter, Ed SInrray, Professor Lany Baldingcr, Forrest West and Dan Clatic lliis year's party bids to be a very entertaining one, so if you happen to be in town try to put in an appearance. 
"George Jackoboice, after a long lay-off due to illness, is now back conducting his road scraper manufacturing business in Grand Rapids. Eddie Brennan is now a member of the Chi 'Herald-Ex* staff in the windy city and is busy in his spare time caring for his twin sons bom recently. Tom Monahan III, also arrived last month and is doing his best to keep the Areola Monahans home evenings. Jim Murphy has left New York City and is now in business in his native Middletown, Connecticut. John Manley has recently opened a law office in Dyersvillc. Iowa. Alex Helo is working in the Mexico City office of the Gen­eral Electric Company and is on the commit­tee to greet Professor Pedro de Landero when he returns there this summer. Dr. Tbad Goraczewski is the new St. Joseph county physician. Stienie Gansangc is with a Wor­cester, Massachusetts, pharmacy company and is planning an early visit to the campus. 
"Nick liohling, one of the few remaining Chicago bachelors, has announced his engage­ment and forthcoming marriage this summer. 
-Lots of luck! Dr. Ed Drares of Detroit was a South Bend visitor during Easter week. Iioa ftfarger.is supervising the brick work on a Middlebur>', Indiana, high school, and Bob Marshall is with the Indiana State Highway commission. Oliver Bennett is now practic­ing law in Fairfax, Oklahoma. The door is wide oi>en at the Matt CoUinans for any of the class intending to visit the Golden Gate Exposition and the Art Bcrc«ns. the Bod Tonhys, the John Lisickis, Stretdi Maliaii, Dave Nash and Johnny Bums will do their best to help you get around the New York 
World Fair, so don't fail to call on them if 
you are at either of these places this summer. 
"Hope that you can be on hand on June 2 

or 3. If not. drop a line advising your where­
abouts and dope about the old gang." 
Chariie Stallkamp, Delphos, Ohio, has just lined up with an attractive job in the offices of D. F, Broderick. Inc., leading Detroit insur­ance firm. Marce Yerbiest, '20, is vice-presi­dent and general manager of the firm.

FIVE-YEAR REUNION June 2, 3 and 4 
Comes now Mr. Moscow, class secretary: 
"This is the last issue of the ALUMNUS 

before our reunion—and my last chance to 
urge you fellows—if you have been delaying 
—^to ask the boss at the office or the one at 
home for that week-end permission over June 
2, 3 & 4. After seeing all those names in 
Bob CahiU's report last month of the boys 
coming back, I can't see how any of you 
can hesitate about making up your minds. 
You can't help now but want—like Charley 
Monnott—to see 'everything and everybody.* 
Remember—it will be five years before an­
other, opportunity like this arises and there 
are 400 fellows wanting to see each and every 
one of you. We'll be looking for you! 
"Our belated congratulations to Bud Vitt and his wife in behalf of Adehrich F. Vitt. Jr., who was bom a short while ba-'ik. 
"My apologies to Harry Black. Jr.'. and Ralph Else for misplacing their correspond­ence. Here's hoping that we'll be all together in June with Rudy Cmkovic, who we sincerely hope has overcome his illness. Ralph Holier, Joe Vaughan of Syracuse and others you two mentioned! 
"March 19. the feast of St. Joseph, marked the ordination of Rev. Edward Seward at Rome. Before his ordination Ed had written me a letter in which he mentioned his inten­tion of remembering the class of '34 in his first Mass. His one regret was that he would not he back in this country before August and thereby would be forced to miss the June reunion. We all share your regret. Father, and extend our hearty wishes and sincere prayers for your happiness and good works in the senice of Our Lord." 
Local Chairman Bob CabiU gives you the latest stuff on the reunion: 
"Events are rapidly shaping themselves toward a grand reunion for the class of 1934. A few more replies to the card sent out fol­lows : Chuck Litty sends his from Buenos Aires where he is selling sewing machines and says he'd like to be here hut the distance is too great. Too bad. Chuck, we'd surely like to see you and 'habla Espanol.' Dave Dal­lyraple. Toronto. Ontario, can't make it; John Roche, from Staten Island, expects an arrival 
May, 1939 The Notre Dame Alumnus 
about that time. Tsk, tsk, John—such timing I 
"And now for those more hardy souls, who have signified their intention of returning: John Devinc, Nonvalk, Connecticut, says he'd like to see George Blaha, Hngfa Farrcll, Jack Dorsey et al; A. T. FitzSimon, Milwaukee; Ed Krause, new line coach at Holy Cross, says he'd like to see Jim Leonard, Kitty Gorman, Joe Pivamik. J. N. Leonard, South Bend; Phil Ott, Michigan City. Indiana; Al Phan­cuf, St. Louis: Clyde Roberts, Oak Park. Illi­nois ; and the inscrutable Geoi^e Wenz, from Jersey City. 
"More than these I know are coming, hut some haven't returned cards, such as Jack Egan, Gil Coyne, Vince Reishman, and others. Incidentally, Vince just left South Bend the . other day after spending a couple of days with us with his brand new wife, the former Dorothy Stark of Charleston, "West Virginia, and a lovely girl she is, too. 
"Jack Claudcr tells me that George Shields dropped in on him in Milwaukee a couple of weeks ago. He also added that Bud McNichols will be married to Florence Egan in Spartan­burg, South Carolina, on May 6. Seems Bud is traveling so much he can't get home long enough to have the bonds forged in Chicago, so the little woman is going to Spartanburg. Must be love. McNichols also called on Old Man Ayres, the city of editor of the Bing­homton *Sun.' who is apparently too busy to 
ever write; and on Vince Reishman, previously mentioned. Clauder's new daughter is Mary Ann, and he and his wife will drive to Spar­tanburg for McNichol's wedding. 
"Coming out of the hotel here in South Bend the other evening, Reishman and I (and our wives, of course) bumped into Ed O'Brien, who had just gotten in from Pittsburgh, and whom wo had been discussing five minutes previously in the hotel bar. 
"Don't forget now—the smoker at S p. m. at the Columbia Athletic Club on Friday. June 
2. the Columbia Club being the former K. of 
C. Building on ^Vest Jefferson; the ball game with the '29ers at H the next morning behind "Walsh Hall; the golf tournament, all day, IS­holc medal play, prize to be awarded; and many other things you'll want to see and do on the old campus, 
*'I hope you read and made note of the letter sent us all by Jim Armstrong. He's got something there. 
"So, until June 2, adios." 
Bob Kcllcy, South Bend, adds some more '34 news; 
"In my trai'els around the northern part of the Hoosier State in search of new buildings (of which there are beginning to be a few more—adv.—Dodge reports), I run into quite a few '34ers. 
"I see Jake Bowers, the old trock man and law student in Kentland, Indiana, quite often. He realty has the town under control between law, insurance and the farm market. Then on my way through Logansport, I see Leo Henricks, who is doing practically all the printing business in town. During the bank night craze I tried to fix myself up for a bank with some of his tickets that he was printing for all the theatres in that part of the country, but no luck. 
"In Huntington, Paal Manoski is doing a swell job of helping edit 'Our Sunday Visitor,' with some assistance from the Bishop. Paul's brother is saying his first Mass on Sunday, 
June 4, and Paul does not think he can get up to meet the gang, but he sends his best regards. 
"Fort Wayne is really full of N.D. men. I eat lunch often with Harry Hnmbrecht, who is helping to provide Fort "Wajne with new houses at the rate of about two a week. Harry burned plenty of midnight oil in the architectural building when we were in school. Jack Logan is a rising lawyer who is prominent in the C.Y.O. Norb Schenkel is an­other burner of the midnight oil who is doing a lot of the building that is making Fort Wayne grow. Ed Fitzmaurice. »nother archi­tect, is running around the country selling theatres new seating equipment, and we have a get-together in Fort Wayne every so often. 
"Ed Fisher, the manager par excellence of the stadium, is living in South Bend just a few blocks from me and is the Dun & Brad­street news gatherer. He and his wife (Jack Buckley's sister) are the proud parents of a young son. 
"I have been corresponding with Michael WeidI, who is living in Atlanta, Georgia, and floor manager of the Rich's department store, the biggest store in the South. He is a little too far away to get to the reunion, he says. 
"Everj'onc I see is talking about coming to the reunion and expects to have a grent time seeing all the gang. Of course. I will be there." 
Eddie Mansfield crashes through from the Denver frontier: 
"About this Ecene-and-herd business. We'll start do\\Ti in Carolina. Three priest-alumni of Summer School sessions. Fathers Raphael Arthur, Alcuin Baudcrmann, and Leo Frier­son, O.S.B., are hard at work putting my junior college alma mater, Belmont Abbey, into the first division of- Southern education. In Greensboro, one of the Berry boys, of a family friendly with mine but not known per­sonally to me, is anxious to . follow in the steps of an older brother who moved from N.D, to West Point not long ago. 
"Down in Georgia, Bernard 'Cokey* Doris, ex. '34, lengthy Augustan, who used to '\Vho­
dat?" every one who slapped at his Howard Hall door, is now slithering through rapidly-closing doors to Southern *\Vbodat3?' Reason: insurance. 'Gawje Wu'th* Andrews, '35, is handling his deceased father's business in Augusta, I hear. Savannah? I haven't been there for so long that anything I might offer would be archival. 
"Climbing down the ladder-rungs of state-lines in Dixie, we might observe that during my stay in Birmingham, we were able to put across some Universal Notre Dame Night stuff for two years, despite our numerical weakness. Among those who traveled long distances at their own expense to appear on broadcasts were Jack Sleagher, ever-popular coach at Auburn, and Frank Thomas, still the rotund ruler of the roost at Alabama. Panl 
R. Mudke, a Clevelander originally, went with 'The Catholic Week' shortly after I left to come here with 'The Register.* He is now advertising manager. Paul is a husband and father, and has had a nice bit of experience in advertising and merchadising in Cleveland, Boston, and Birmingham. (Imagine the ac­cent: midland, back-bay, fuzzy.) 
"Then" we must point a proud finger at those easy-goin* gen'l'men of the deep gulf country, those 'Nigger' Crawfords Nos. 1, 2, 
3: J. B. of war-time vintage; Ed of Layden's era, Pat of depression year age. The first two are handling their dad's machinery busi­ness, the last Is with Texaco. I lived with Ed for a week once when his folks were away, and the big old Crawford house echoed with mad laughter at his tales. Father CHarx missed them on his trip thron g Birmingham in '35. and I always thought he considered that Southern junket a flop for that reason. 
"Then there was a Jokn Bcrsdield, of Bes­semer, one alumnus who was one alone as far as my meeting him was concerned. Reports are that he keeps the LL.B. shiny bright. Tlten there are about a half-dozen Benedic­tine Fathers at St. Bernard do^vn there who are advanced degree holders, and who are using Notre Dame methods to advance the degree of their school's excellence. 
"Ray and Afaarice Faherty, the handsomely grey young men of newspaperdom. were with the ad department of the Birmingham 'News­Age-Herald' the last time I talked to them. Ray has been head of classified for years, and 'JIo,* now married, is with display. 
"Bill Moloney, who had to leave N.D. be­cause of the Indiana climate (that's no gag), finished his law work at Frank Thomas* in­stitution at Tuscaloosa, is now with the legal department of Alabama Power, and is presi­dent of the Catholic Men's Luncheon Qub of Birmingham. 
"A Monaghan lad I never met is now Ala­bama Rhodes scholar at Ozford. after one or two years at Notre Dame. Joe McGeever, a fine lad whom I knew when he was in high school, should be at N.D. now, along with the Meehan scholarship holder from Alabam*. Bill Thomas, an aero-engineer. 
"That about covers the deep South, espe­cially the star-struck sector. It occurred to me several times that most of these fellows never hit the ALUMNUS pages, and that many of their scattered friends were in the dark about them. 'Fiat lux.* 
"I'm leaving coverage of the Denver beat to Chock Cassidy, as I mentioned, so I'll men­tion some place 600 miles cast. In Kansas City, I've had numerous loud, wordy, mean­ingless disputes with John O'Connor, *34, and Norm Bowes, '34, the demon N.D. club oncers in the city that lives on brew from April trf November. O'Connor, the sage of Sorin, mar­ried one of the loveliest ladies west of the Mississippi at N.D. last October. He insisted on my risking her culinary wrath last Christ­mas. I reneged. Reason: train fare bill, not bill-of-fare fear. Raglan-sleeve Bowes is still one of the best sports-tale raconteurs in the business. 
"One of my closer side-kicks. Jack Sheehan, *36. is moving ahead nicely with Crane-0-Fal­lon here. He and I are fro^vned upon and be-broomed by his red-haired mother at least once a week for our eternal game of *. -. and then we punted.' Mrs. Sheehon vows that she shifts to the right all the 'way to the corner grocery the morning after our sessions, and then docs spinners between the canned goods stacks. 
"My mail contacts with the '34 boys have been shamefully infrequent, and I clunk charred wood on my bowed head in great irregular chunks. More effective than mere penitential ashes. Recently • engaged Gene Blish I see several times a week. John Clander was here oh his honeymoon. Al Smith popped in on his way from the coast. Angle Von Boecklin's been here once, and

that for Frank Widser's -wedding. Ray Slcycr, '38. played brilliantly here twice with his Chicago I.asalle Cavaliers in the top-flight Missouri Valley AATJ basketball league. Danny Gibbs left us after Christmas for med school in Chi. (Oooops!! Sorry, Cassidy, that's your beat). 
"Here's an editorial policy poser: are notes about St, Mary's girls eligible for these 13­em strips? I'll tlirou- this in for the edifica­tion of Bill (the Barrister) Kennedy, Bill (the Bard) O'TooIc, Murf (the Mannon) Manoski, and since it's private, all other '34 readers are asked to assume astigmatism for one column-inch: 
"Boys, Laura Lou Finan, St. M's '3G, came through here on her way fiom xbe coast three weeks ago. Reported Mary Lucy McKean of the AIe:candria and N,D. McKeans at work on the coast after foreign tnivcl and success­ful careering.) 
"End astigmatism. Pick up '34 notes. 

'•Jim Kcams, '34, (my beat, Cassidy) came here for the Chicago 'Kews' last summer to cover the National Open. I had dinner •with him, once saw him inveigling a kid in a tree to count Guldahl's putts for him on the final green. Modern newspaper methods. Jim is happily wed. 
"Dr. Dan Pflanm told me last night that Claude Blaze 3Iullcaguc, '35. the poker-playing engineer, is still in Omaha, he believes, and that March Schwartz is tramp-tramp- tramp­ing to success at Creighton. 
"Cousin Joe Mansfield '36, the family ruc­cess, and the lad who made a grandfather out of his dad before he became Joseph Mans­field, A.B., is still with WJAR in Providence. Continuity and announcing. He looked like a fright-wig salesman, he said, when the flood hit last year and marooned him in the sta­tion away from wife and babe.

1935 ^crctary: Franklyn C Hochreiter, 530 St. Peter St., New Orleans, La. 

"The lost has returned, the dead awakened, the silent. has found his tongue and type­writer! Here we are again gang—and with a bag full of ne^vs that will keep you busy for many a moment. Not having as yet received the March ALUMNUS, though it be Easter Sunday as we write, and several have sent us polite but definite remonstrances for our delinauency. we do not know how our beloved editor explained away our first slip in four yearsi But we trust he was charitable. 
"We must, of course, give you a word our­self. The notice for copy came but four days before it was due, and we were working day and night at the ofiice and at the Little Theatre, with no spare moments to pound off more than a letter of regret to the 'man be­hind the desk.* But now that the rush is over in both places and we are able to draw free breath in our Vieux Carre' patio, we hasten to start on the May copy weeks in advance and to send it in as a guarantee that we have • returned to life. There is so much before us that we wonder if our friend with the red pencil will t>ermit it all to go through. But we think he should since w*e have double space coming to us. So here goes.... 
"First of all, thanks a million for the many letters of felicitation on the happy event. And for the beautiful gifts from the prexie on down, well, all the Hochreiters can say is 'we appreciate them more than you will ever know.' There is a standing invitation at 530 St. Peter on Jackson Square in New Orleans* 'Vieux Carre' for all of you. 
"Secondly, the letters and cards that poured in after the March void under 'Class of '35' made us feel that we were doing something to keep our crowd together. "We were almost glad we had missed an issue, for now we know that you out there do enjoy and appre­ciate our meager efforts. Believe us, we'll try not to miss again. For the grand response in letters and other communications we offer our humble 'gratias.' 
"Let's start things off with a few wedding announcements. There were two ceremonies on the 11th of February, and the two happy people that were in the siwtlight at one of them spent an evening with us down here during Mardi Gras, while on their honeymoon. 
"John J. Burke took to himself Margaret May Katholing at high noon on that event­ful day in Saint Philip Neri Church in Chi. Later, we drove past the Iblonteleon Hotel one noon and saw them standing on the steps. A quick shout and soon we were introducing our brides and making a date for a future meet­ing. The next week the Burkes came down and we hashed over the law and the 'country's most interesting city* while imbibing the con­tents •»! c'itglttss goblets until the wee hours. To John and Mrs. Burke the class extends their 'lotsa of the besta.' 
"On that same memorable Pebru.-iry 11, John "Jake" Kunz married Dorothy Jean Crampton in Slilwaukee. To you, Jake, and Dorothy Jean we are sending all our wishes for happiness and good luck. 
' "A little later in the month, on the 21st, Don Love up Buffalo-way walked down the aisle with Mary Carolina Person. Here is to a long and happy life, Don, with future quar­terbacks for the blue and gold. 
**Shortly after we had taken up residence in our hideaway a note brought us news that Mr. and Kirs. John Tinglcy had reason to celebrate a happy event last November 18 when a daugliter. Judith Clark Tingley. was bom to them. John is living with his bride and offspring at 229 Broadway in Norwich, Connecticut. Congratulations to the-Tlngleys. and may the next one be a boy to even the score. 
"Now we'll go back to January when we received a long epistle from Pat Fisher in Indianapolis. Pat usually comes through once a year and then saves the rest of his dope for Commencement. . Fop the last swell dis­patch we bow deeply, Pat, but how about an­other for June—we won't be on the campus this year. We'll just go along and give you the news as -we take it from Pat's sheet. 
"Joe Argus is seen around the local environs frequently. He is with his dad in the real estate business. We understand that Joe made the rotogravure of the 'Sunday Journal* around the turn of the year. It seems that the firm put an ad in said paper, and Joe's picture went with the ad. Immediately business in­creased several fold—that is for the paper. No report on the real estate increase. 
"\Vith about 25 more N.D.ers is Joe Beck. at the office of the Bell Telephone Company. Seems that we reported Joe there once before. 
"Pat writes that Jack Slattcry 'is still on the same job.* Not recalling what that is we can't report it, but how about a line. Jack 7 
"We understand that Pat Quiglcy and his accordion are in town (Indianapolis) with some U. S. Company. \Vhat the firm is we are not quite sure—^Pat's pen slipped when bo came to the initials. How about more identi­fying information, Pat? 
"It comes through that Art Kntnzfcldcr is employed ' by the Reilly Tar and (Hiemical outfit in the Indiana capital. 
"This will interest Bill Schmidt, about whom we have heard nothing for years, because Bill and Joe Dnicckcr sen-ed head table together for some time and practiced toe stands be­tween courses. Joe is a salesman for Lindc Air Products, a division of Presto-Lite. 
"The Indiana Refining Company has claimed the ser\'ices of our own Don Fclts. 
"\\Tiat is it that the Telephone Company has? It is holding down Clarence Pjckard and Dick Schagcr, too. Clarence is a long ways from home we would venture. Which brings to mind Mitch Salch. ^Vhat are you doing, Mitch? How about a letter, neighbor? 
"Closing out the Indianapolis contingent is the news tliat Bob Malamcy is the local office of the NLRB. Of course, we all know that that smiling Irishman who wrote the missive is casting his legal pearls all over town, and with & profit we hear, 
"During the '3S football season Pat was in on a few games—-Kansas. Illinois, Minnesota and Northwestern. During his week-end jaunts he ran into a good number of our crew, and we list them for you just so that you along with us will know they still live. There were: Fran Dunn, Pete Viviano, Tony Scolcro. Paul Guamicri, Tony Brick, Art Mulholland, Jack 
(Stock Elxchange) Robinson. Tom La Londc, Bob Hcnncbcrgcr, Jim Rcvtllc, Bill Mcascr, Vic Mettler, Frank Matthys, Jack Parks, ex. *35, and Jack M'jistcr. 
"Art Mulholland is doing himself up well in the outdoor advertising game we hear. 
"Holly\vood is pla>-ing host and home to Vic SIcttler while ho plays ball with that team in the Pacific Coast League. 
"Jack Parks started with the mob in Brown-son and then left to finish up his work at Ohio State. Our word is that he is practicing the law in Cleveland, and that he asked par­ticularly about our Jack Rainey. 
"Talk of Northwestern and one talks or at least thinks of George Dcmetrio. \Vhat would the Palmer House he without George? And what would a football came be without De-' metrio as stake holder. And so he was last season. 

"At the efiirte Pat sat with John (Roundy) Pofcuc. John is married now, we understand, and is living on the south side of Chi. Also in the party was Chuck Montgomery all the way from Mercer, Pennsylvania. Long time since we heard of you. Charlie. Chuck was on his vacation. No exact dope on your money-earning business, but we hear it is not medi­cine. May we have the correct data, Charlie? 
"Bemic O'Brien is teaching school some­where in the big town. There is rumor about that Bernic intends to follow Frank Leonard along the marital path. Any truth, Bernie? 
"Having dinner with 'singing' John Kynn day after the game. Pat found that 'ong John* is still in commercial photography. 
"What do you think? That's right, we're back with the Telephone Company again. And this time the Illinois Bell with whom Ed Simpson is spending his time, and inci­dentally, from whom he is earning his salary. 
"Our bedfellow of the Old Town Boys Club in Chi. Luke KcWy. is really hitting the high spots in social work in South Bend in the county DPW. He recently attended a welfare conference in the capitoI town. Likely the State Conference of Social Work. Thanks for your line Inst January, Luke. May we expect another? 
"There is talk, via rumor which we would like verified, that Phil Heinle underwent an operation recently, and the surgeon—Bucky O'Connor, M.D. 
"Pat wants to he rememberwl to Jack IVTc-Donncll. the same being now delivered. He also sends congratulations to Jack Matthews and Bay Brodcrick. May we ask the reason for the felicitations? We might like to get in on them, too. 
"Word comes through that Jim Collcran continues with the accounting firm in Cleve­land. He drops down to the Indiana metro­polis now and then. 
"And here is news hot off the Fisher wire— our fairheadod friend, Arky Fairbead, ivho for a good while after taking the sheepskin was taking advantage of his political con­nections in Washington, and who. we reported, had retume<I to the home state some time ago, really stopped halfway in Indianapolis where he worked for a period. He just re­cently went back to the land of Bob Burns. 
"More dope from dame rumor, and this time that Jack D'Arcy, Camille Gravel and Ray Brodcrick are clerking it in one of the courts in D. C. "We know that Camillc is in the capitol because Mrs. H and the scribe drove up to AleKandria. Louisiana in January to check over a couple of state institutions for defectives and delinquents. They are next door to the home town of the Gravels and Jacobs, etc. So, after our business was concluded, we called Phil Jacobs, and finally reached him. There followed' a long visit in the Jacobs* domicile over some very fine wine. Phil looks in tip top shape and has just been promoted at the local bank, which incidently is quite an institution. Phil gave us info on Gravel and all the goings-on in the upper Louisiana Club that has just recently been organized. The H*s are still awaiting that visit, Phil! 
"Matt Ronzonc made an overnight stop in Indianapolis during the winter months for a pro basketball game. Matt is coaching and teaching at Frankfort High school. We do not know if it is still a fact, but we know that it was so, that Karl Fulnccky was county athletic supcr\*isor in the same town. 
"The Hoosier barrister informed us that we slipped badly in not reporting a very import­ant social event of the year in the way of wedding. The time or place didn't seem im­portant to Pat, or at least he did not volunteer it. But the groom was Gene O'Reilly and the luckj' gal—Eileen O'Connell. Among those in the wedding party were: Frank Weldon," Jim Shells and Bob Dcvine. Much felicitations to the newly-wedded O'Reillys, who now are liv­ing at 209 Angell St. Providence, R. I. 
"Of Frank Weldon we are told that Frosted Foods Sales Corporation is employing him and that he is a salesman in charge of the Long Island territory. Frank is holding down a I»ed and clothes-tree in Hempstead. 
"How go things at Fordham Law, Jim Shells? We hear that you are still carrying on in the night division and doing the claim work for the CaFualty and Surety Under­writers. 
"And here is a real teletype flash on Carlos de Landero. Carlos as you know is head en­gineer at the Alamo mine of the Real del Monte Co. in Mexico. He had a serious acci­dent last June in which a worker broke both arms and legs trying to save him. It would seem that the fall, handsome engineer came through Siifely with the exception of a few scratches. Pat sends his best, Carlos, since you do not seem to get his letters. And again ^ve repc'it your address for the gang. Carlos docs want to hear from you fellas—how about it? It gets pretty lonesome doi%-n there stuck away in the hills. How* about you engineers getting out the old pen and paper for a quick line to Carlos. You can write to Apartado 73, Pachuca, Hidalgo, Mexico. From us—the best, fella! 
"That about cleans up our Indianapolis cor­respondent, and we arc grateful, Pat, for all the swell dope you sent on to us. 
"With Pat's epistle came a short missii-e from Fred Locke Morris out there in Mexico. Missouri. Yes sir, it's not often wc hear from our straight shooting, drawl-talking, hand­some Missourian. Thanks for the congrats, Fred Locke. 
"Fred Locke writes that he is still single and 'looking for introductions.' Not bad. kid, not bad! We note<I from the letterhead that the Morris boy is secretar>*-treasurer of the Morris Grocerj* Company. 
"That was a nice piece of news you sent on about Duke Walters, Fred. May we pass on the wortl that Richard 'Birds' Eye Frosted Foods* Walters is really doing a grand job of selling? And for our p:irt—may we say— how could he miss? 
"While we are out in the woolly parts of this h'yar country let's have a line about 'Two Gun' McGrath. Fred saw Mac in Columbia recently and the report is that our rifle cap­tain is now driving a very verj- yellow Cadil­lac coupe. The last we heard it was a red job. 
"Red Ilosan is out in Jlexico, too. He is in the clothing business, and. between the Hogans and the Morris's, we'd venture that Slexico is well taken care of. Fred Locke writes tliat the recession hasn't stopped them because 'as Mexico goes, so goes the world.' Nice homely expression, Mr. Morris! 
"Early in February came a short one from Ed O'Hara. Ed wanted to clear up our query about the new bride's name. She was the former Agnes Marie Smith, recently with the Rochester. New York, school systenu Thanks much, Ed, for the clinching data and for the word on Joe Cordaro. 
"Joe is teaching science at St. Edward's College in Texas. Didn't know about this, Joe. Luck to you from us! 
"Around the first of March came a card from the Notre Dame Club of Kansas City signed by the otRcers: Dr. D. SL Nisro, pres­ident; Ed McGratb, vice president: Henry Classman, secretary, and John Pncan, treas­urer. It informed us of the Rockne Memorial Services. We appreciated your thoughtfulnesa up there! 
"And then in the middle of the month two letters arrived on the same day—one from Siena. Italy, and the other from Chi. The first was an eight-page document from Andy 'Banjo' Maffei, The second from the Polish ambassador of goodwill—Arthur Lncins Jos­eph Bernard KorzeneskL We'll take one at a time.... 
"Our missit'e from across the pond vrns the first we had ever received from 'Banjo* and it was realb' a treat for it was packed full of travel news of the continent. We think that some of it w-iU be of interest to the gang so we shall quote at length rather than give outr version of Andy*s narrative. 
" 'I have been here since January IS, last— having left New York right after the New Year. This trip is both an investment and a vacation that was promised to mc when I got out of N. D. I continued on at St. John Law ­School in Brooklj-n, and was graduated from there in June. 193S. Being one of those "for­tunate" ones, I passed the New York State Bar exam that same June—along with Bill Miller. "We took it up at Albany. After beinff admitted to the New York Bar on October 19, I went to work in a law oflice in Yonkers. After a month or so three of us decided to found our own law firm—none of the members are N. D. men, but one is from Fordham and the other from Cornell. Hence we now have the firm of Cerrato, O'Brien and Maflei, with oflices at 20 South Broadway, Yonkers. New York. 
" 'As a great deal of our work will be centered around Italian-speaking people. I thought that such a trip as this would be a great asset to us (no expense to the firm). Hence they agreed and consented to my leav­ing the office for six months, ending July I.* 
"And so we find Andy at the University of Siena taking such courses as 'Italian Lan­guage and Cultui-e,' 'Immigration and Finance' and 'Italian Legal Terminology.' He is in Siena until the first of April when he leaves for an extended trip to southern Italy, Tripoli in Africa and the Island of Malta. After returning to Rome about May 15 to take a special course in Italian languages, 'Banjo* plans to sail for home the middle of June. His western crossing will take him to Yugo­slavia, Greece. Algiers, Gibraltar, Portugal and the Azores. 
"Your letter was a grand surprise, Andy, and an interesting one, too. The itinerary was of special interest "to Mrs. H who had made a good deal of it two years ago. Here is to all the luck in the world when you return, and thanks a million for the felicitations. 
"Andy asked to be remembered to all the class and especially to 'our cronies at school.* 
"And now to friend Art. Thanks for the wedding announcements kid—glad to see you are still in there pitching the news our way. 


"Art ^vcs no dope on himself outside of his being laid up with the flu and thusly not being able to Tiestman' the Kunz wedding. Tough going when you can't see one 6f your best friends ofF, and after you had been sav­ing up your best pranks for the celebration, too. 
"According to the Chicago messenger Jack Claric and ^-ife were expecting the stork around the middle of March but at time of writing he had not arrived. 
"Wally O'Brien and the 'head of the house' were also waiting the 'happy event' around the same time. Art says he told them to make the 'deadline' but got no further word. How about a little verification from the Clarks and O'Briens on the Korzcncski rumor? 
"Of that handsome devil from the Michigan Shores, Bus Brccn, we learn that he is now the budding barrister, the busy attorney, in the Loop. 
"After being nominated for secretary of the Chicago Club by his sidekick, Korzie, Jack Clark made the grade. 'Local boy makes good.' Art suggests 'that more of our "guys'* ought to set into jobs like that and put in some time for the old Alma Mater/ We go along with you on that. Commissioner, But glance through the local club columns sometime and l*oa will sec us well represented. 
"The wires bring through the info that Freddie Bookmeycr was elected prexie of the senior class at Loyola Law School. The family moved to the 'windy city' last year, and Fred stepped right out to set the pace. Nice going, fella! 
"It's been a mighty long time since that suave Frenchman came through with a bit of his own creation, but the first week in April brought a long letter from Louie Grosso. Thanks for the surprise, Lou, and the inter­esting dope on our N. D. and Columbia pals. We have the following for you and Tom Proctor on the 'Creole Citj-.' 
"The climate is balmy—soon will be hot. Winter suits are now (in mid-April) laid away and we are wearing palm beach—soon it will be shantung, basket weave and linen (we re­fuse to wear seersucker). We did make the Mardi Gras—every last part of it: eight pa­rades, enjoyed the civic holiday and took in the Comus Ball—the best of the season. It is true what they say about the Creoles, but don't consider this town Dixie. New Orleans is a unif^ue city, in a class by itself, with the people speaking a dialect that is a cross be­tween 'you air and 'thoity-thoid street.' fig­ure that one out—it still has us puzzled! Mint juleps? Not so much as the 'Original Ramos Gin Fizz' and 'Sazerac' (All this is free publicity for which we intend to collect from the local Chamber of Commerce.) 
"Louie has made a definite strike at last, and the end of January tied up with the law firm of Leslie, Holt, Halstead and Frost at 120 Wall Street. Nice going, kid! 
"Of the '35 news volunteered by Monsieur Grosso we ^ve you the following.... More dope on Gunner McGrath. It seems that a recent letter tc the Groc told of a visit of the McGrath boy to N.D. Mac is still working for the home ton*n bank and has purchased for himself a motorcycle which he uses to deliver checks about the countryside. Wonder if the Gunner carries a trailer or a sidecar for his guns? 
"Running into Jack Dono\-an in Jimmy Ross* Tavern a few weeks ago, Louie found that John is taking the law in easy doses at Fordham Night School and is working in a law oflice during the day. 
"Not having seen Bob Rogers in many a month, the Groc sends the following through to you. Bob 'Tell him I'll be over to see him shortly.' 
"Remember the 'The Senator' from Ver­mont, our scribe of first floor Sorin who dili­gently put out the rag called the 'Scholastic' every Friday? Well, John is doing the legal brainwork for the Rutland Railroad at this writing and is anticipating, with the breaks, political and otherwise, going over to one of the Federal legal bureaus, possibly the Trust Division. Louie reports John as wearing 'an air of dignity such as only certain of the profession ever acquire.' And we believe itl 
"^Vith the NYC epistle came a card from Miami Beach and Bob Fox of that famous Fox DeLux Beer. Bob and Mrs. Bob are va­cationing in Florida and report it as the 'best spot ever.' Felicitations, Bob, on the stork's package of last May. Hope he makes the trip in record time for the return trip in June and delivers the mate. N. D. needs good timber! 
".-Vnd then for Easter came a real surprise from Prcxie Proctor. The Elkhart Blackstone came through with another letter though his last remains unanswered. 

"Tom writes that the new Rockne Memorial is a magnificent structure. Wc believe it is now being used at least in part. We trust that the dire threats of Armstrong and Doolcy are herewith wiped off the books with this tome, prexie. 
The prexie has just finished trying jury cases for two solid weeks and is perambulat­ing about the county and down to the capitol to smell out the political wind. But more, yea more! Tom ran the Elkhart County Infantile Paralysis Drive and put it over the top. To top it all off. the silver tongucd Proctor toastmastered the Elkhart High" School Bas­ketball banquet and rumor has it that he really gave them a liberal dose of what we debaters called 'Coyne's Con\'incing Confabula­tion.' 
"Ray Oakcs writes Tom often and from the latest grapevine code 'is doing nicely with his eyes open to the future.' 
"A short while back came a clipping from Buffalo which carried the announcement of the Bill Mcascr-Elizabeth Mason engagement. Bill, as you will recall, has been teaching school at the high in native Williams\ille, New York. The intended bride is from Buf­falo. The wedding is booked for summer. Lots ' of luck. Bill! 
"Toward the end of Lent, on a Wednesday evening we went out' to the Sacred Heart auditorium (the C.S.C. parish) for a showing of the '35 Ohio State-N. D. game pictures and an illustrated lecture by Father Wcitzcl, C.S.C. missionary from Bengal. There we found Joe Drolla sitting behind us when the lights went on. Joe is doing very vrell in the legal de­partment of New York Life here. 
"Coming out of the Little Theatre after 'Libel' one night we ran into Mike Shcedy standing on the curb. We shouted at him, but it v.-as not until after he looked behind our make-up (which we removed at home in the next block) that he recognized the face. Mike was not very informative as to his business in New Orleans, but we gathered he was on a bit of a social jaunt. 
"Stopping for a red light one noon hour a large, good-looking car drove up next to us and we noted the elder of the two men was listening to the news flashes on our radio. Looking around the second time we found the driver of the car to be AI Vltter. The light turned a moment later and we had but a word with Al. We can report that he looks prosperous, and from bis own report— 'things are going well.' 
" 'The Catholic Action of the South,* the weekly Catholic, diocesan paper of these parts, brought us the news around the middle of April that Camille Grave! won honors in the Moot Court trial before the federal judges for Catholic "University law school recently. As a result he will go to New York shortly for special competition and a conference. (This is follow-up on the dope above as it was written just before deadline.) 
That about brings us up to date for the May number. We have covered the works since the January correspondence. As for the scribe, with the exception of a little extracurricular activity in the local Le Petit Theatre du Vieux Carre, the job keeps us on our toes. Since we won't be getting north for Com­mencement week-end this year, how about another batch of letters and cards to give us the material for a bang-up finis for this season in the final June number? We're waiting for it, let's have it! Our deadline is June 10— we'll set yours for June 6 to have dope in our hands. 
Harold Gocbel. of South Bend, who received his Ph.D. last June, is now a chemist for the Mishawaka Rubber and Woolen Mfg. Co. (Ball Band). 
Tom Hickcy, Jr., South Bend, was recently elected first district president of the Indiana Funeral Directors' Association. 
Up at Mt. Carmel High School, Johnny Jordan, with brother Tom, '38, assisting, was the coach of the Chicago Catholic League champions in basketball this past winter. Wally Fromhart, '37, and Fred Mundcc. '37, did a similar job with Mt. Carmel football last fall. 
1936 Secretary: John Moran 61 E. 9Sth *^ St., Apt 2, New York City. On the wings of spring (who threw that?) comes Hearts and Flowers Moran: 
"Spring's here—or so somebody told us the other day. But we wouldn't know from the New York weather lately. But Spring 'is' here, so we thought a little housecleaning would be in order. Now, the problem is where to begin. 

"Well, starting with the oldest item first, we want to announce that the newest item in Gil Moty's household is named Mary Pa­tricia. Gil's card announced that the new arrival, a 'howling success,' was bom on March 13. Mother and father are doing well, we hope. Congratulations, Gil, and thanks for the card from way out in Bend, Oregon. 
"Ah, sweet, beautiful spring. ^Vhich re­minds us that we bumped into Vince Gorman, '35, in Grand Central Station early in March. We were wistfully looking for a chance to stowaway on the Florida bound Orange Spe­cial (who said spring was here), while Vince was going home to Kingston, New York, for his spring.(what! again!) vacation from Cor­nell Med School here in the Metropolis. Vince reported that the life of student doctor is a long and diflcult one, as Frank 'Doc* Murray, and Walt Sullivan. '34, also at Cornell, are learning. 
"Lilacs to somebody or other. But not to John Desmond, who won one of the door prizes, a Packard electric shaver, at the March alumni meeting. John is still with the Union News Company as a travellings auditor. It is rumored that he plugs the shaver in the Hirht socket on his way to work in the subway every morning. Gives him three extra min­utes in bed. So no lilacs, John, just electric shavers. 
"Also seen at that same meeting were a goodly number from *36 who turned out to hear Line Coach Joe Boland comment on Inst season's football games, except the Southern Cal contest, which Joe skirted as gracefully as a good halfback going around end for a nice gain. Carl Letscn was there, and stated that he is working vnth his father in the family haberdashery shop in Yonkers. Biff Flannerj-, who works for a law outfit in the Graybar Building during the day, must be a man of tremendous capacities, for he goes to St. John's Law School at night for more legal knowledge­
"Also at St. John's Law are John Hunt, who gives his days to the Equitable Life In­surance Company, Bill Shea, Jim Dwj-cr, Howie Cnsack. and Joe SIcNally, '37. 
"Ho hum'. Smell that Spring! MMJIM! Jim Kiiby, demon accountant for Lybrand, Hoss Bros, and Montgomery, has been getting the wanderlust out of his system with recent business jaunts to South Cnrolinn. and Bridge­port. Connecticut. Jim, together with your correspondent, have recently been teaming up to make pood their threat to beat Jim Mac-Devitt, '35, and Cy Stroker, '37, at handball. 

'*Tra-la, Tra-la, Tra-la. Sign of spring. Vincc Hoffan, '35, all tanned from a couple of weeks down in Florida. Also seen at the March meeting -was another '356^ Ed Brack­en, who has been travelling over the country with the General Motors Exhibit. Ed will be stationed nt the World's Fair for some time this summer. 
"Ho! Hum! Must be spring fever. Any­way, Siff Sluzlca, '35, went and got himself married some wf?eks back. Jim Comeaa has entered a seminary near Albany. George Milton is the proud papa of a strapping young­ster since last fall. George is connected with his father's canning works in Brooklyn. Bill Tourney, '35. is with the New York Daily 'News.' as are aiso Tom Fennclly and Tom Kccnan. 
*'WaU Slatuscvich is leading a suni-cying party down in Greenwood. Delaware, for Gibbs & Hills, construction outfit. Walt is bringing electricity to the rural regions, as the first step in a rural electrification pro­gram. 
"Ah. the joyous Spring! It makes you want to sing. At least it does Bud Goldman, who is co-author of a new tango to be published by one of the larger New York music houses. When 'Florecita' hits the No. 1 spot on the 'Hit Parade.' you'll know the old Juggler Vein Funny Man has arrived in a big way! 
"Seen at the Universal Notre Dame Night celebration, n beefsteak dinner at the Aldine Club, were, among others, Ed Hammer, Jim Reilly, Gene Lounsbero'. and Joe Newman. Ed is now studying for the priesthood at Dun­woodic Seminary near the city. Joe Newman is with the Social S«urity Board in Balti­more, but is now travelling around the coun­try verifying payroll records. Temporarily. Joe is stationed in New York. 
"Andy Hafnagel is now with the New York Life Insurance Co., and Jim Reilly continues as a demon salesman with Wilson Brothers, sporting goods concern. Cy Stroker, *37, re­cently won a Lambeth Walk Competition con­ducted by Horace Heidt at the Bowman Room of the Biltmore (Foley, please note!). Cy did himself proud, and walked off, or rather danced off, with a magnum of champagne as a prize. Woops. spring is here, says the Waterbury sprite. 
"Tra-la, Tra-la. The flowers that bloom in the Spring! But what about the follow­ing shy violets who haven't raised their voices in lo, these many months: Georce Ireland. Norm Johnson, Jim Jones, BUI Jones, Frank Joyce, Ralph Kaiser, Dan Kalczynski, Ray Kane, Dick Kane, George Keller. Art Kcllcy, Frank Kcllncr, Don Kelly, Ed Ken­nedy, John Kenedy, Pete Kem, Art Kerns, Lindcll Kinman, Ed Kirby, and John Klrsch. 
"And so, maybe now you're convinced that spring is here. Which is our cue to ask for a few letters, say 'So Long' till next time, and retire for a nice long rest. Spring Fever, you know." 
193 7 Secretary: Paul Foley, 1S036 Schoen­' hoer Road. Detroit, iCdu 
The Detroit Foleys reporting: 
"We could have paid five cents a word for correspondence since the last musings and not even missed a meal. In fact, we have to go way out in the outfield for a lead and dig up some mutterings filed away under 'Screwball' in our personal file. The epistle is from John Cackley. We quote: 
" 'I have been busier than two drunks in a revolving door . . , referoed some 40 basket­ball games during the winter without a scratch. Am now working for the W. Va. Liquor Control Commission.' 
"There may be some connection in the two activities. We are not sufficiently acquainted with either West Virginia basketball or West Virginia liquor and its control to hazard a guess. But we do know Cackley. 
"Jim McHugh, the ex-manager, is press agcnting for the World of Mirth Shows (plug). We can just see him in a checkered vest, derby, celluloid colar and cuffs with a horseshoe in a baby-blue four-in-hand. 'Hurry, hurr>-, hurr>*—' 
"Paul Smith has been appointed football and basketball coach at Sacred Heart ~H.ish School, Charleston. West Virginia. He will take over next September. 
"Off the police beat! 
" 'Kidnapped with his pretty blonde com­panion whose name he refused to divulge. James Waldron, '37, was robbed of his money but tender-hearted thugs allowed him to keep his college ring and pin.* 
"It's the McCoy. Waldron and a 'compan­ion,' were leaving a Jersey night spot and were accosted by two armed men who forced Jim to drive away in his O'ATI car to an un­lighted spot where Sunny Jim was relieved of his watch and money. Jim and girl were then obliged to plead for the return of Waldron's 
N. D. ring. The girl, lost a diamond ring and she and Jim were forced to hitch-hike home. 
"John Byrne is to be a June-groom. We haven't the exact date at hand but our Eastern representatives say it's all set. The girl is charming Miss Mary McKay whose photo graced Philly papers recently flashing the en­gagement news. So far no word from the , garrulous Jocko. 
"After quite a siege of illness Frank Reilly is reported up and doing in great style again. We have missed his letters but blame our own lack of industry in failing to ans^ver. 
"Local bits: Business is holding up for Hank Rnen who is making, or selling, or both, coat hangers in and around Detroit. Wc got that from Gore Hastincs, the mortician, who is also clipping along merrily. John UQinuin is engaged in the family business. Something to do with buriap bags, according to the scant information from Vllniann. 
"Still in the deep South is Bob Grogan, last reported as assistant traffic manager of an oil company bearing his own name but having only a cocktail connection to the Terra Haute branch of Grogans. 
"We heard something about Joe Dntecker, but forgot what it was, other than the fact that he is selling compressed air to beat the band and is around Indianapolis somewhere. 
"Chicago Dept.: Bob McCIatn, we are told, is still at the 'Herald-Examiner' (we hope). Current guests (or recently current at any rate) in Lawson Y., include: Greg Byrnes, George Bonfield, Frank Lesselyonc, Tony Mazziotti and a long list of others oft re­ported. They are pursuing various careers and showing admirable restraint about writ­ing. 
"Those from whom we must hear within 30 days, or else: Gene Ling, Al Sdiwartz, De Lancey Davis.. Jerry Claeys, Bill Gibson, Dick Dclaney. Cy Stroker. 
"Did we tell you earlier of the marriage of Bob *(3eech' Pnryear? He took the step some time ago down in Arkansas and is re­i>orted in a blissful state in spite of Ar-
Tora Durkin sends word from California: "^Vlle^ last seen Bunny McCormick was still after his teaching certificate at Southern Cal . . . then hack home to Livermore and a coaching job. Lon Parccll.' who belted them out in the Bengal Bouts, receives his Master's from the Stanford University graduate school at the spring quarter. A position with a large Pacific Coast corporation goes with the new degree. 
"Ben MuUen flew down from the Northland recently and reports that all is well in Juneau igloos, for the current supply of blubber should last the winter. 
"Lloyd StoUtch, the salad man from Salinas, . is said to be making a good thing of the let­tuce business." 
John Levicki snared a large portion of the national spotlight recently as coach of the Fort Wayne, Indiana, Central Catholic High School basketball team which won the national Catholic interschotastie championship at the annual tournament sponsored by Loyola Uni­versity, Chicago. They turned the town inside out for days when John and his lads returned as the conquering heroes. Catholic Central is one of the schools operated by the C.S.C. Brothers. 
1938 SccreUrr: Harold A. WlHiams, 2U East Lake Are.. Baltimore, Maryland. 
Ted Prtkowitz was the general chairman of a banquet for the CYO basketball teanis of South Bend on April 27. 
Jack Laccy, formerly secretary in the Vice­President's office, is now an Air Corps cadet at Randolph Field. Texas. I,atest word is that Jack soloed after 8% hours' instruction. 
Early as usual was this news from the Baltimore sector: 
"I was sitting under a blossoming MagnoHa tree thinking about Spring and CJhalledon's chances in the Preakness when the realization suddenly bloomed that copy 'would have to be sent immediately if the '38 boys were to be represented in the May issue of the ALUM­NUS. 

"This morning Gus Sidler, who was dri\-inE through Baltimore, telephoned and we had a delightful chat for three-quarters of an hour. Gus, after a pleasant summer in Europe, entered the graduate school at Fordham for some more philosophy. He reports that he recently heard from Bud Cullcn who is teach­ing at some private school in Chicago. Gus also mentioned that Tex Hai^gard. the old allocator of Alumni Hall, was in New York recently. Tex, I understand, is still working for his father in Texas. Ted AIcHugh is probably the luckiest fellow of the *3S boys when it comes to job: According to Gus, he is in the bathing suit business and has the job of outfitting Billy Rose's Acauaquade for the N. Y, World's Fair. 
*'I was over in A\''ashington recently for a major league baseball game and I bumped into Johnny Braddock. Johnny is in good health and has a fine tan. He states that he is working outdoors for some public titilitj' company, and that the 'SENATOR*, George Howard, is working for a "Washington news­paper. 
"Ed Bartnctt wTites on the stationery of the New York "Hmcs* that he is now employed on that venerable paper as a copy boy and is also doing book reviews for his Daddy's New York 'Sun.* Tom Shicis, Ed reports, is also in newspaper work—working in the Classified Ad department of the 'Journal-American.' About the N.Y.U.-N.D. basketball game, Ed says, 'Saw quite a few of the boys: Bill Gallin, Red Sclafani, Gene Vaslctt. Jack Doyle, Bill Marguct (copy boy on the N. Y. 'Daily - News.' Ed Van Hone. Walt Harris, Frank Dctschcr, Tom Shicls, Cliff Tallman (doing well in promotion work for the Amer­ican Tobacco Co.) Ed Uniachc, and a few others.* As a postscript, Ed adds that Jim Sullivan is back as a guard at the Pilgrim State Hospital in Brentwood. Long Island, and that Chuck KIctzgcr -writes from N. D. that he has to ask fellows to move so as to dip his feet in the new swimming pool. Thanks, Ed, and that letter will be along any day now. 
"Jack Solon, from in Philly, upholds his 
' honor rating as a contributor to this column with the following: 'Only guy we've seen anew is Joe Mcssick who loft school at the semester. He was up for a little chin and a few beers one night and it was like old home week. . . Tom O'Brien writes from N. Y. that he is still hunting a job . . . Word from Johnny Hurst has not been received—perhaps he is still at home in Toledo—wish he would write some of his old gang. . . Dick Danahy came down a couple of weeks ago and roomie Zcrbst took him out. Then who should come romping in but Jim Mulhcm who was on his way back to studies at Georgetown Law. Jim has taken up flying in earnest and at the Newark airport bumped into Dan Cochran, up to two weeks before that Art Mulhom's room­mate at Harvard. Dan is now working for Eastern Airlines. Dan has also announced his cnRagement to Miss Rita Smith, of St. Louis.' 
"Jack went on to tell about N. D. night in Philly. He says that he. Cliff Prodehl, '32, president of the Philly N. D. club, Tom Car­roll. '30, secretary of the Philly N. D. club, and a couple of announcers, iiut on an N. D. skit and got quite a bit of favorable fan mail for it. 
*'Bub Crowley, from -way up in desolate Beach Haven, New Jersey, writes the fol­lowing in that even script of his: 'Johnny Beer, the old roommate, is working for Mont­gomery Ward Co. in Chicago; his address is 20 W. Superior St. John Thomburg (who used to raise all the racket in Lyons Hall) is work­ing for the Hart Drug Co. in Evans\'ille, In­diana. I am at the present a member of the Beach. Erosion Gang. I am to be a life guard during the summer. The job at the L:me Drug Co. in Toledo fell through about the first of December when the company changed hands. I took a six weeks* vacation in Miami, Fla.' 
"Bub wants to know Tom Hcaly's address. I haven't the street address, but I know he's living in Westchester, New York Several fel­lows, including Bill Donley, are trying to lo­cate him. If anyone sees Tom tell him to communicate with Bill or myself. 
"Eddie itlattingly writes that he is still working for his father in Cumberland. Eddie incloses in his'note a clipping from the Cum­berland 'Daily News': An eight column streamer proclaims the news that Harold F. Langton is the new athletic director at La Salle Institute. Hal reported for work May 
1. He will coacli all sports and also ser\'e as a full-lime instructor in the school. The article says, in part, 'Hts athletic career at 
N. D. included 2 years oC boxing, 2 years of wrestling, 4 years of speedball, 4 years of soccer, and 4 years of track. He also plaj*ed on the badminton and tennis teams, and was on the swimming team 4 years.' 
"Frank Lan%'ood. writing from 3307 N.E. 21st Ave., Portland, Oregon, says. 'My former roommate. Redmond Duggan. is at N.D. work­ing for a master's degree when he isn't serv­ing as Dr. Gurian's right-hand man on the 
•Review of Politics.' Fritz Itzin is also &t school working for an M.A. and is again the mainstay of the St. Vincent de Paul society. William 'Lefty' Jordan is clerking at Penney's in the Bend. He and John Gear}*, '36. are batching. John is teaching in S. B. Catho­
lic . . . Vincc Murphy, '37, is on the editorial staff of the 'New World' in Chicago. Bill Cour is working for the roads commission somewhere near hs home town, Springfield, Illinois. My Portland classmate, J. Scallon Rcilly, is breaking in with a law firm here. As for myself, I was another left high and dry by tlie now defunct S. B. 'News-Times.' . . . Things are rather slow on Pacific Coast papers, hut I. like a gold miner, still have hopes of striking something tomorrow. Frank Burke, '37, has recovered from a rather long illness and is dickering with several oil com­panies on the Coast for a job. Gil Moty. '36, who now has an interest in his father's hea\*y implement and auto accessories in Klamath Falls, Oregon, has been put in charge of a new store at Bend. Oregon.* 
"There is only one more issue before we close for a summer vacation. l*d like to bear from all the fellows who haven*t had their name mentioned yet in the colum. Copy should be in by June 6 as the 10th is my deadline. 
"That all for this time, except that two weeks ago I was made editor of the 'Union News* in Towson. 
"And now I'll go out and sit under the blooming magnolia tree again. . . .**
