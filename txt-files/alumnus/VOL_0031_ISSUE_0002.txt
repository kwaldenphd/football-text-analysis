John H. Neeson, Jr. 
Philadelphia, Penn. Dear Fellow Alumnus: March 10, 1953 
As the new President of your Alumni Association, may I extend my best wishes to all of you. Also may I pledge my best efforts to represent your Association and the University in those matters which require my attention during the current year. 
 would ask you to join with me in a general program or theme for the year, that is, to intensify our efforts in enhancing and publicizing the prestige of the University of Notre Dame. In gratitude for the privilege of being known as one of her sons and in part-payment for the many benefits received from the University, we must all consider our­selves instruments to further educate the general public in the academic and cultural achievements of Our Lady's University. 
There have been many things accomplished and there are numerous prestige-promoting items concerning our Alma Mater which many of us, to say nothing of the public in general, are unaware, or forget, such as the fact that our Law School is the oldest Catholic Law School in the country. "The first courses were taught in 1869. 
By means of these letters in the Alumnus, I hope to bring such items to your attention so that eventually you may hove these facts at your fingertips for presentation in your conversations and to the public whenever possible. 
May I ask that you renew your allegiance, so to speak, and work to tell more people more about your great University. Sincerely, 
/s/ JOHN H. NEESON, JR.,

In Journalistic parlance the symbol "30 " is used at the end of a story to guide printers in setting type. But for the ALUMNUS maga­zine "30" is not the end—it's just a little past the beginning stage! THIS IS THE THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NOTRE DAME ALUM­NUS MAGAZINE—and it seems like only a few short press runs since Volume One came out in 1923. 
The ALUMNUS has grown-up, and along, with the Alumni Asso­ciation. Alfred C. Ryan, '20, now of Buffalo, N. Y., was the maga­zine's first editor. At that time the Alumni Association numbered 2,300 men. Present day count shows 23,000 former Fighting Irish­men in the U.S.A. and numerous foreign countries. The Association has progressed from 'a club' to the current total of 127. 
James E. Armstrong, '25, succeeded Al Ryan as editor and has been on the job since 1926. In between then and now there have been several managing editors, who wielded a potent blue editorial pencil. These included William R. Dooley, "26, now Placement Di­rector at Notre Dame, and John P. Burns, '34, Jersey City, N. J. 
The editors are particularly grateful for the encouraging comments from our readers these past three decades—and we are especially indebted to class and club secretaries for their wonderful cooperation in submitting news and meeting deadlines.—(J. N. C.) 
Notre Dame Glee Club is one of the featured attractions on the radio show. 
Distinguished campus representatives will highlight many local club pro­grams. Some clubs vnW feature out­standing speakers in their own area,­while others plan to use University films.

RECENT GRADUATES ACTIVITY 
The revival of F. Scott Fitzgerald 
•writings has thrown such a haze of ir­responsibility around those of us who were graduated in the '20's that we felt the resdessness of the recent gradu­ates ought to be considered by a jury of their peers, and not in the light of our suspect experience. To that end, the Alumni Board of Directors, at its January 17 meeting, appointed a Com­mittee on Recent Graduates, composed of six graduates from within the years 1947-1952. This Committee is conduct­ing by Questionnaire a survey of their Classes in representative areas to de­termine the attitudes of recent gradu­ates toward (a) the Local Alumni Clubs, (b) the ALUMNUS magazine, and (c) their preparation while un­dergraduates for the alumni state of life. 
From this organized approach, we hope to derive some substantial im­provements in procedures and pro­grams which we have been reluctant to launch on simply tlie basis of a case liistory. 
PRESTIGE AND PUBLIC RELATIONS 
Mr. Galvin Hudson, '15, of Mem­phis, Tenn., is the new chairman of the Alumni Association Committee on Prestige and Public Relations. It is the work of this Committee to promote all channels by which the values of Notre Dame education can be better reflected in the achievements . of our alumni and their relationships with the business, professional, cultural and civ­ic lives they lead and influence. 
Obviously, the Committee can nei­ther train nor accomplish the full identification of such alumni. That is a Job for all of us. Club officers. Class officers, and individual alumni, can do much by seeing to it that merit is further enhanced by the Notre Dame . identification. This includes (a) local publicity, (b) local Club pats on the back, such as letter of commendation, honor at a meeting, statement from the Club president or board (c) publicity in diocesan Catholic press, (d) notice to the University of achievement, so that personally, and publicly, the Uni­versity can broaden the recognitions. 
Each alumnus, as he applies the total University. And as the total Uni­versity is built, so is the individual stature of every alumnus. 
CONFUSIONS 
The Annual Alumni Fund is a cal­endar year operation. The 11th An­nual Fund opened Januar)' .1, and closes December 31, 1953. The contrib­utors of 1952 are eligible for the ad­vance football ticket sale, the only real channel in which we apply a yardstick, because of limitations of supply. 
The Father Cavanaugh Testimonial Fund, which extended from July, 1951, to July, 1952, and which was, tech­nically, just an added crediting for contributions within that period, served to confuse slightly the annual charac­ter of the Alumni Fund, which, how­ever, was never actually changed. 
UNDERGRADUATE RELATIONS 
The Alumni Association was host at a Communion Breakfast for the Januar)', 1953, graduates^ Rev. Ed­mund P. Joyce, C.S.C., celebrated a Mass in Dillon Hall on Sunday, Jan­uary' 25. His three-minute baccalau­reate asked only for the continuing devotion of the Class to the Blessed Sacrament. Mayor John Scott, '38, ex­tended a greeting to graduates, in spite of the handicap of flu, and Jer­the Class and guest Deans and ad­ministrators alike. 
ALUMNUS THIRTIETH BIRTHDAY 
With this issue, the Notre Dame ALUMNUS is 30 years old. It was launched in January, 1923, with Al­fred C. Ryan, '20, as its first Editor. : Your present Editor took over in Jan­
uary, 1926. 
By policy, the ALUMNUS has as­
sumed that Notre Dame graduates have 
had access to broad literature, to busi­
ness and professional developments, to 
social and political progress, in other 
publications appropriately aimed and 
staffed to reflect those fields. 
It has been the policy and purpose 
of the ALUMNUS to bring to Notre 
Dame men the news of other Notre 
Dame men, of the many phases of the 
University, and of things affecting 
either the University or its alumni, 
which cannot be found elsewhere, or 
which need added stress in our par­
ticular Notre Dame family. 
Under this limitation, we may seem not to have grown much. But analyzed in the light of policy, the 30 years have reflected a progress in both our University and ourselves, which can be a proper source of pride, and of satis­faction, modified only by the great un­folding future of Notre Dame as yet unrealized. —Jim Armstrong, '25

Alumni Football Ticket Privileges BY M. ROBERT CAHILL ATHLETIC TICKET AAANAGER 




Are Basically Unchanged for 1953 
The basic points of Alumni Football Ticket Distribution for 1953 will be the same as obtained in 1952, by de­cision of your Alumni Board at its Januar)' meeting on the campus. The Board, like the rest of us, concedes that our system is not perfect, but the best workable solution to a many-sided problem. 
We'll give a quick rundown on the requirements and privileges, and then get on to a bit of exposition as to par­ticular games and tlie restrictions that may be necessar)'. 
1.
 Alumni contributors to the Tenth Annual Alumni Fund in 1952, plus religious and honorary degree hold­ers, are eligible for advance sale order forms for '53. Exception will be made for 1953 graduates, whether Februar>', June, or Au­gust, if the contribution is re­ceived by June 10, 1953. 

2.
 Alumni Advance Sale Opens June 22, closes July 15. 

3.
 Advance Sale order forms are mailed to eligibles as above prior to June 22. Mailing is staggered to permit all areas same opportun­ity of filing orders on first day of sale. Orders arriving before first day are held until June 22 and shuffled with that date's orders. Forms are good for two tickets per game, and honored until July 15 or UNTIL THE TICKET SUP­PLY IS EXHAUSTED. 

4.
 General-Use applications, for most games, will be sent to ALL Alum­ni the latter part of July. These cany no priority and are good only AFTER Alumni Advimce sale closes July 15, for such tickets as remain. General-Use forms may be used for ordering additional tickets, for friends, or for the alumnus himself if he needs more than the two obtainable on the Advance Sale form. 

5.
 General sale will open on August 


3. The Ticket Committee wU be glad to send general public blanks to anyone you may designate as 
long as tickets are available. 
6. Alumni Clubs interested in group orders should notify the Ticket Committee BEFORE JUNE 22, for tentative reservations. Fulfill­ment depends entirely, however, on demand from indiWdual aliunni and no definite assurance can be given until that individual sale closes July 15. Because of this in­dividual preference, wc hereby ad­wse and warn again all alumni that the seats available for bloc orders can only be the poorest of our al­lotment, or what is left after in­dividual orders arc filled. As a general rule, bloc orders for games away from home — particularly Oklahoma and Pennsylvania this year—^will be difficult to handle due to relatively small ticket allot­ments as the visiting team. 
UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME 1953 FOOTBALL SCHEDULE Sept. 26—Oklahoma (Norman) Oct. 3—Purdue (Lafayette) Oct 10—Open Oct. 17—Pittsburgh (Notre Dame) Oct 24—Georgia Tech (Notre Dame) Oct 31—Na\-j- (Notre Dame) Nov. 7—Pennsylvania (Philadelphia) Nov. 14—N. Carolina (Chapel Hill) Nov. 21—^lowa (Notre Dame) Nov. 28—Southern Cal (Los Angeles) Dec 5—So. Methodist (Notre Dame) 
Ticket Locations 
And now, as they say in the Medi­cine Show, let's take a look at this little diagram on our right. It's a sche­matic arrangement of the various prior­ity groups we must care for in Notre Dame stadium. It illustrates our dis­tribution for a t)-pical "big" game, such as Oklahoma last year, Georgia Tech and Navy this year. 
Alumni Sections—Including a bloc of tickets in Section 9 allotted to Mono­gram men. Alumni occupy the 14,000 seats in Sections 1 to 9, inclusive. You will note, though, that about 800 sea­son tickets in those sections arc not available. These season tickets were sold prior to 1952, and because of their re­newal option they still remain unavail­able to alumni orders, although many of them are held by alumni. No new season ticket orders have been assigned on the east side since 1942 and most of them were purchased when alumni demand was light — alumni orders formerly covered only Section 9, and part of 8 as late as 1945! Hard to be­lieve, isn't it? Now, only 4,000 of these 
14,000 seats available to alumni lie be­tween the goal and the 50 yard line; and of these 4,000, only 1,600 fall in the 35-50 area. Please think this over be­fore blowing your top over the loca­tion of your two alumni tickets, even though you ordered, to your way of figuring, early. Obviously, if 3,000 orders arrive on the first day of sale, that's 6,000 tickets already gone from the alumni section; and the second day's sale will be past the goal line. It happens that way, too, more often than not. 
Season Ticket Sections—Originally, season tickets comprised only three west-side sections, plus a few seats on the east side. Now they start at Section 27 on the west side and stretch all the way past the south goal posts—about 16,000. The same seats are renewable each year, and naturally no one with a choice location ever lets go. All of the best seats have been held continu­ously since the stadium opened in 1930, a great many of them by alumni. Alum­ni might do well to look into the sea­son ticket purchase this year, in view of the attractive five home game schedule. Unfortunately, we can't do anything for you on location, but alum­ni close by can protect against sellouts by purchasing a season ticket It's sold at a reduced rate, and goes on sale May 1. AVc'll be glad to send you an order form if you'll let us know. New season ticket orders will be located in the south end, where we get our only turnover in season tickets. 
Visitirig Team Sections — Visiting team allotment as blocked out in this diagram totals 8,000 seats. We try to limit the visiting team to that total, else we'd have no public sale what-

soever for the more popular games. Not all visiting teams take the full 8j000, but rarely do they take less than SjSOOj which is the total of scats be­tween the fifty and goal line in Sec­tions 10 to 13. When the visitors do require less than SpOO (North Caro­lina last year, for example) we util­ize the unclaimed sideline seats for alumni, provided we have them on hand when alumni orders are filled. Sometimes visiting team tickets are re­turned too late to send to alumni (Southern Methodist in 1951j f'rin­stance). 

Student Body, Parents, Administra­tion Sections — These categories are self-explanatory. Just a word about the Parents Section—started it a few years ago in the post-war era of quick sell­
.outs. Parents were being shut out by waiting till school opened, then hav­ing their sons order tickets for them when they returned to classes in Sep­tember. September found many games sold out. So now we send an applica­tion blank to parents in June; to give theni a little edge over the public. Location-wise, wc can't do much for them as is evident in the diagram but

we can assure them of seats. The forms go, however, only to parents of upper­classmen, not incoming Freshmen. 
Away-From-Home Problems 

As the visting team, we are really in trouble most places wc go so far as ticket supply is concerned. We get about what we give to visiting teams, depend­ing on stadium capacity. Of recent years, with our ever-growing alumni body (we now total about 23,000) we've had to limit the sale on some of our games away to alumni in the area of the game site. The same will hold true this fall, at least for OKLA­HOMA at Norman and PENNSYL­VANIA at Philadelphia. Application forms will be sent out only to alumni in the states surrounding those two cities. Just which states is determined by alumni population. Last year for Penn we managed to cover all the states on the eastern seaboard, %vith an extra general-use application for four tickets to alumni residing in the State of Pennsylvania. In addition, we took care of several eastern cliibs mth blocs of tickets for Penn. We hope to be able to do the same this year.

Contributors Preference 

We know that some alumni feel that the contribution as a reqm'site for ticket preference is a touchy subject. // the requisite were established sim-• ply to ensure contributions, we would agree. But to us, it's just about the only way of separating the men from the boys. With over 20,000 alumni now on the rolls, we feel sure that were we to extend blanket privileges to all, sheer weight of numbers would operate to make the privilege meaningless. Fur­thermore, any amount contributed qualifies the alumnus, and the simi is not only not relevant but hot known to the Ticket Office. And anyway, we know the method isn't perfect, but un­til someone thinks up a better one, this seems to operate wth the fewest com­plaints and inequities. Mentioning com­plaints reminds us that we don't seem to get many any more. Could it be that the griping has gone underground? Seriously, we do appreciate the cour­tesy and imderstanding we get, by and large, from our alumni, and we earn­estly ask that if you do have a gripe, you'll write us, or call us. We'd wel­come the chance' to furnish explana­tions or if need be, corrections.

After Serving as English Head for 17 Years 
of course where he belonged. "He's 
About eleven o'clock on the night of Wednesday, Januar)' 21, Father Leo 
L. Ward died. A couple of weeks be­fore, on the feast of the Epiphany, he had celebrated his fifty-fifth birthday. 
The Epiphany now seems a particu­larly appropriate day for him to have been bom on. It is the feast of the showing-forth of Christ, the day of the manifestation of God incarnate among men. And in Father Ward's life— though every last person who knew him will realize how instantly and ad­roitly and wittily and honestly he would have denied any such suggestion as pre­tentious—there was a clear and im­mediate showing-forth of Christ-form­ed humanit)', a manifestation of Christ­like priestliness. 
He was bom in Otterbein, Indiana. He was ordained a priest of Holy Cross in 1927. He spent the academic year of 1930-31 studying at Oxford. He died of a heart attack. For seventeen years he had been Head of the Department of English. He collaborated with John 
T. Frederick of that same department on a pair of remarkably fine text­books. He edited a collection of New­man's Discourses. Back in the late 1920's he was writing and publishing 
, a succession of short stories that led to his being emphatically acclaimed as one of the most promising young American writers of fiction. 
Later, he pretty much stopped writ­ing stories. The intense energy — so quiet and controlled that it was de­ceptive—and the high talent, the sen­sitivity and the wisdom and the con­stant marvelous feeling for fun, all started going into the direction of the department, and into the personal re­lationships, into the long or short priv­ate conferences and visits and phone-talks and moments outside the class­room with this one here and that one there. Hundreds of students, teachers, seminarians, priests, brothers, sisters, bus-drivers, salesmen, executives, and electricians are his beneficiaries. And add to them dentists, doctors, nurses, farmers, politicians, stray fishemien and occasional himters of anything be­tween duck and bobcat, as well. People. Not just people here at Notre Dame. People everywhere, wherever he went 
and talked and was. Yet here most of all. 
He had a way of bringing people out and up. In his presence you knew se­cretly that you were better than your­self. You were wiser and wittier and gentier and finer than you had it in you to be. He not only radiated good­ness: he engendered it. 
But nothing solemn about him. No show or fuss. Everj'thing diffident, gra­cious, and quiet. Some people thought him shy. Really he was sly: sly and kind. He was as sly in his generosity 
Rev. Leo. L. Ward, CS.C 
as he was kind in his joking. A gen­erous joker, who even slyly and kindly made private fun of the pain which he knew intimately for quite a good long while. In one of his final lectures he referred to leg-pulling as a "mis­chievous Christian virtue." It was one which all his life, along with a nimiber of higher virtues, he practiced heroic­ally. 
He was buried on Saturday, January 24, in the Community cemeterj'. At the Mass in Sacred Heart Clmrch there were a good many people, from a good many places. The general feel­ing was not at all one of darkness and desolation. It was rather one of poig­nant pride, as at some triumphant con­summation. Nobody who knew him made it," said one of his more collo­quial friends that dark cold morning: implying rightly that where he now is he will in his swift, bright soul be re­membering our present needs and our awareness of a gap in the daily texture. "Let the cymbals clash," said one of his oldest friends. Another one said, simply and finally: "Already he has seen God."

Senior Class Gives Flag to University 
The annual observance of Washing­ton's birthday took place on the cam­pus, February 21, with the traditional presentation of an American flag by the senior class to the University. Rev. Edmund P. Joyce, C.S.C., e.\ecutive vice-president, accepted the gift. It will be blessed and flown for the first time on Commencement Day, June 7. 
Father Joyce told the group that they "have a special responsibility to stand guard at the ramparts of our nation. We musf check the secular­istic trend wherever we may, by bring­ing God back into the market place, the courts of justice and the school­rooms—in brief to all walks of public and private life. . . ." 
Alfred C; DeCrane, Cleveland, Ohio, Senior who represented the seniors, stated, "We must make great demands on ourselves and accept as worthy of ourselves what is still far above us and what requires a further effort in order to be reached." 
Ernest J. Bartell, River Forest, 111., was chairman of the ceremony and Kerwin H. Fulton, Huntington, W. Va., president of the Senior class, pre­sented the flag to Father Joyce. In ad­dition to the seniors, thosse present, in­cluded oRrcers of the administration, deans of the colleges, and command­ing officers of the University's ROTC units.

The Marriage Institute 
Is there such a thing as love at first sight? Who should control the family purse strings? What is the major cause of misunderstanding between married people? What about mixed marriages? 
These and many other questions will be discussed during the Fifth Annual Marriage Institute to be conducted at the University of Notre Dame March 3-26. Sponsored by the University's department of religion and open to seniors, graduate students, and mar­ried students, the Institute was found­ed in 1949 on the conviction that learn­ing how to live as a good husband and father is an essential part of educa­tion today. A series of sixteen speakers, ten of them la>'men, will discuss the religious, social, economic, physical and psychological aspects of marriage. 
The Marriage Institute evolved in part from an elective course in "Chris­tian Marriage" formerly taught by the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.'s.C, now President of Notre Dame. Father Hesburgh, who was chaplain to Notre Dame's married veterans and their fam­ilies in the post-war years, returns to the Institute again this year on March 10th to speak on "Courtship and En­gagement."

Brothers Print Booklet 
The Brothers of Holy Cross have published a new booklet which tells of their life and work in the education of young men. Liberally illu.>t:ated, the booklet—"Have You Thought -About the Holy Cross Brothers?"— 
The Notre Dame Alumnus 
traces the histoiy of the teaching com­munity from its founding in France in 1820. Today the Brothers of Holy Cross teach in seventeen dioceses in the United States in grammar schools, high schools, and colleges. 
The vocational booklet outlines the qualifications a young man should have to become a Brother and the phases of spiritual formation and training he receives before becoming a member of the Congregation of Holy Cross. Can­didates spend a brief period at one of the Brothers' Juniorates at AVatertown, AVisconsin, or Valatie, New York, be­fore entering St. Joseph's Novitiate at Rolling Prairie, Indiana, for a full vear. 
Holy Cross Fathers Publish Booklet 
The Holy Cross Fathers, who oper­ate the University of Notre Dame, have recently publishd a pamphlet which tells simply and graphically what a priest is and what a priest does. The attractive 36-page brochure re­views the priest's role as mediator, pastor, preacher, and teacher. It also depicts the priest's work as a mission­ary both at home and abroad.

It out­lines the requirements of a candidate for the priesthood and describes the life and work of priests of the Con­gregation of Holy Cross. 
Students at Gethsemani 
More than 80 Notre Dame students participated in a three-day retreat at the .'^bbey of Our Lady of Gethsemani in Kentucky. The students gave up their vacation between semesters to pray and meditate among the Trap­pist monks. 
The annual retreat at the .'^bbey is sponsored by the Young Christian Stu­dents, a Catholic Action movement on the Notre Dame campus. The YCS first began sponsoring this yearly re­treat four years ago, but Notre Dame students have been making retreats at the Abbey since before AVorld AVar II. In his book Seven-Storey Mountain, Thomas Merton recalled that a group 

Notre Dame's basketball Irish were defeated !n NCAA regional play in Chicago by Indi­ana, 79-66. The season's record was 19 won, 5 lost. .Above: Dick ' Rosenthal and Coach Johnny Jordan. 
of Notre Dame students were making a retreat at the Abbey of Our Lady of Gethsemani the first time he visited there. 
AVhile at the Abbey the students en­ter into the rigorous life of a Trappist monk. They maintain strict silence throughout the day, whether they are attending a conference, one of the lit­urgical rituals of the Church, or read­ing one of the many books in the Ab­bev designed to induce meditation. 
Bishop McDevitt Papers to Archives 
The University of Notre Dame ar­chives recently received six trunk-loads of the personal papers and belongings of the late Most Rev. Philip R. Mc­Devitt, Bishop of Harrisburg, Pa., from 1916 to 1935. The material, which was donated to the archives by Miss Mary 
R. McDevitt and the late Helen C. McDevitt, does not contain the official papers of Bishop McDevitt's episco­pate, but includes his diaries and cor­respondence pripr to his consecration. Also included are papers related to his work as episcopal chairman of the Catholic Press Department of the Na­tional Catholic Welfare Conference. 
A portrait of Bishop McDevitt as a young priest, painted by Thomas Eakins, the noted American artist, was presented to Notre Dame by the don­ors along with a bronze stauette of the Bishop by sculptor Samuel Mur­ray. Before his death Bishop McDe­vitt presented to the University ar­chives a collection of letters dealing with the persecution of the Church in Mexico. 
'Vile Bodies' af Notre Dame 
The first American production of Vile Bodies, a dramatic adaptation of the novel by Evelyn Waugh, was pre­sented by Notre Dame's University Theatre March 5-8. The satiric nov­el on the ultra-modem antics of Lon­don's young set was adapted for the stage by John D. Tumpane, director of the University Theatre and Rev. John 
J. AValsh, S.J., director of the Mar­quette University Theatre. 
Father Walsh and Mr. Tumpane be­gan collaborating on Vile Bodies while taking graduate work at Yale Univer­sity in 1949. "Because Mr. Waugh has never permitted a Broadway or Holly­wood production of any of his works," Tumpanc said, "we at Notre Dame are especially pleased that he has given us permission to do a University produc­tion of Vile Bodies."

Change in Lawyer AcademicProgram 
Dean Joseph O'Meara, Jr., of the Notre Dame College of Law announced virtual abandonment of the elective system which he said is based on the assumption "that students know more about what it takes to make a la%vyer than their professors do," Addressing Chicago area alumni. Dean O'Meara declared that for the most part the Notre Dame law school ^v^ll have "a prescribed program of instruction" in the future. 
"The elective s>'stem not only pro­
ceeds on a fallacy; in practice it in­
volves many absurdities," O'Meara 
said. He recalled stories of students 
who never signed up for a course 
which was taught above the second 
floor or before 9:30 in the morning. 
"The elective system tends to coddle 
students; it encourages them to choose 
what are thought to be snap courses 
and instructors with a reputation for 
marking high," O'Meara added. 
Dean' O'Meara claimed that the elective system "is at ^var with one of our obligations, namely, to train law­yers for responsible leadership. This means that our graduates must have a rounded and balanced legal education; and this, in turn, means that they must have training in areas which, if left to their own de\nces, many would pass 
by." "There still will be electives in tlie Notre Dame College of Law, but they \vill be offered in the summer session," Dean O'Meara revealed. He also an­nounced that the law school will in­augurate cumulative, non-compart­mentalized, comprehensive examina­tions. Examination questions, O'Meara said, will not be "labeled." Ratlier, he said, "questions will cut across various fields of law as questions with which lawyers have to \\Testle in real life," 
Dean O'Meara was introduced by the Honorable Sher%vood Dixon, for­mer governor of Illinois and a Notre Dame alumnus. The University admin­istration was represented by the Rev. Philip S. Moore, C.S.C., vice-president in charge of academic affairs. The luncheon, sponsored by the Notre Dame Law Association, was attended by the president of the Association, Joseph f, Deeb, Grand Rapids, Mich. Judge RogerJ.Kiley of the Illinois Appellate Court was general chairman. 
CITE HOLY CROSS GROWTH IN ROME 
(£d. Note: Scvenil very significiuit developments of the Congregation of Holy Cross,^ all of them of interest to Notre Dame alumni, are taking place in Rome. The ALUMNUS asked Rev. Rob­ert Pelton, C.S.C., just returned from studies in Rome, to comment. Father Pelton, Class ^of 1943, a member of the Department of Religion, was lately responsible for the alumni reading list published in the ALUMNUS in 1951.) 
Since the founder of the Congrega­tion of Holy Cross, the Very Reverend Basil Moreau, went to Rome in 1851 many significant works have been car­ried on there under the tutelage of the Congregation. In that initial year Pope Pius IX personally asked the Commu­nity to take over the direction of an orphanage, Vigna Pia, as well as a trades school called Santa Prisca. Two ' years later, in 1853, the Collegia di Santa Croce (Holy Cross College) was inaugurated in the Eternal City. 
This year marks the centenary of this last-named foundation. Today the Collegia has an international aspect TOth some fifteen Holy Cross students from varying provinces. It also serves as the residence for the Very Reverend Edward L. Heston, C.S.C, Procurator General of the Congregation, and Re­ligious superior of the house. Also, one of the Holy Cross' most distinguished members, the Right Reverend WilUam 
J. Doheny, C.S.C, an auditor for the Sacred Roman Rota, makes his resi­dence there. 
Also the Brothers of Holy Cross have initiated a project which is proving to be a welcome and needed addition to Rome. It is called the Notre Dame In­ternational School far Boys. Its aim is to give a thorough and well-rounded Christian education to boys on the junior high school and high school level. The classes are conducted in English; and this is a feature which is appreciated by a growing number of residents there who desire that their children receive such language training in a good Christian atmosphere. 
The school was opened in Rome in October of this preceding year under the direction of Brother Ellis Greene, C.S.C, and three other Brothers of Holy Cross. There is also a Notre Dame lay graduate, Mr. Pesoli, who is on the staff. At the beginning of the school year there were forty-eight stu­dents in the school. One fourth of the bovs are boarders. At the time of this writing both faculty and students are increasing in numbers. Thus the fu­ture of the school looks most hopeful. 
On December 8, the school was of­ficially blessed by Cardinal Micara, the Cardinal Vicar of Rome. Also present were the Very Reverend Christopher 
J. O'Toole, C.S.C, Superior General of the Congregation of Holy Cross; the then United States Ambassador to Italy,, the honorable Mr. Ellsworth Bunker, and numerous other dignitar­ies. Among the persons who spoke, the Cardinal Vicar clearly indicated his gratitude for the foundation; Father O'Toole brought out the purpose of this work, how in reality it is a con­tinuation of the Congregation's work which began in Rome over 100 years ago, etc. The number of distinguished visitors present was another indication of gratitude for the steady cooperation being given by the Congregation in Rome. 
Father O'Toole has also indicated that the Congregation will continue to develop in Rome in the near future. Soon a new Holy Cross Gen­eralate will be constructed there. It will be the residence of the General Admin­istration of the Congregation. At the same time a new international Holy Cross College will rise with facilities for some fifty or sixty students. These buildings should be completed within a period of two years. 
Along with this material develop­ment in Rome, Holy Cross is enjoying definite spiritual advantages also. The causes for the canonization of the Very Reverend Basil Moreau, and Brother Andre, a most devout Canadian lay Brother of the Community-, are advanc­ing apace. Both have successfully pass­ed through the diocesan processes; and are now being examined in Rome. Re­cently the Chancery of Rome acting in the name and authority of the Mont­real Tribunal, has begun the oflidal investigation of a miracle attributed to Brother Andre. It is the prayerful hope of the Congregation that the official introduction of the causes \vill take place in Rome within a year. 
Thus the spiritual and material de­velopment of Holy Cross in Rome dur­ing the period of the last century is quite evident. It is hoped that in the providence of God this continued growth ivill set the tone for an ever greater contribution of Holy Cross to the all important mission of the uni­versal Church. Under the patronage of Our Blessed Lady this participation can and will become ever deeper and more vital.

Oa Sunday, December 7, our first Communion Breakfast ^vas held for the 15th annual obscr\'ance of Universal Notre Dame Communion Sunday. Breakfast was held at the Uni\'er5it>* Club, and the Rev. Bernard A. McCaffrey, C.S.C.. '36, Chaplain of St. Joseph of Holy Cross, Valatie, New York, was the principal speaker. 
We want to send a special thanks to Jim Arm­strong for obtaining for us the Highlights of 1951 for that Breakfast. It is tlie most gripping piece 
of work I c\'er saw. I noticed cver>*one was sit­
ting straight up or running with Lattner, AVorden 
or Heap and the excitement w-as intense. Ted 
Budjitkieuicz, *49, was our projectionist and he 
asked to show the picture to his Christian 
Brother Academy and I told him that would 
probably be agreeable with Frank Leahy if he 
would turn out and send another John I>attncr 
to Notre Dame. 
Those present at the Breakfast were Bernard Duffy, Bill, '40, and Cullen Burke, *23, Mr. and ^^rs. Fred Suter, '48, Pete Nantista, '39, Mr. and Mrs. Frank Ott, '22, Ted Budynkiewlcz, Walt O'Brien, Larry O'Neill, '34, Dan Mahoncy, '34, ifr. and Mrs. Paul IVeber, Ray Kinley, Ed Eckert, '33, Mr. and Mrs. John Campbell, '26, Jim Drislane, '38, Joe Conlon, '35, Bob Mona­han, '34, Andy Pinckncy, '41, Frank Disney, '23, Mr. and Nfrs.

Chicago 
TTic Notre Dame Club of Chicago was quite 
pleased and honored whcit Father Edmund P. 
Joyce, Executive Vice-President of the University*, 
spoke at our Annual Communion Breakfast Dec 7. 
About HO Ahimni attended the 10 o'clock Mass 
at Old St. Mary's Church. Breakfast followed at 
the Blackstone Hotel. Father Joyce spoke of 
some of the intentions of the University in regard 
to the future of telc%'ision as a means of com­
munication and its potential use as an educational 
medium. He also stated some of his interesting 
\-iews in regard to the NCi\f\ and their treatment 
of the televising of football games. 
A novel idea, embodying cooperation with an old 
and respected rix'al (in athletics) was put into 
practice with notable results by the Chicago Club 
in December, ^^orking with rcprcs-nlatives of 
Xorth^vestern University, the club prepared and 
mailed out applications for tickets for the annual 
N.U.-X.D. New Year's eve basketball donnybrook. 
An entire section of scats was set aside for Irish 
rooters. I'm told that around 500 of the faithful 
turned out to sec another ND victory over the 
Wildcats. Much cheering, and e%'cn Xorthwcstcm 
was consoled by the financial returns of the ticket 
tactic — for which they promptly sent sincere 
thanks. The incident is recorded here in the 
thought that other clubs, located where ND is 
visiting team for a sports event, might follow 
somewhat the same pattern with the home school. 
•We're
 well on our way into a new year, and let's take a look at some of its first events, and some of those scheduled for the near future. On February 14 the Chicago Club held its second Scholarship Fund party at the Casino Club, 195 

E.
 Delaware. TIic party ran from 5 to 8 p.in,, and the cost was 510 a couple, while the Pump Room orchestra provided the music. Proceeds of the party will go toward the Scholarship Fund. 


The party was patterned after the first Scliolar­ship Fund gala held October 4 at the Blackstone. But what is imquestionably true is that the ca­pacity of the Blackstone was net strained by the October 4 attendance. Usually there is an ex­planation for an event's failure to go bit,; but puz/Ied experts in party-making and party-gomg confessed themselves as licked by that aflair. We had won a notable upset victory over Texas in the afternoon; the weather was good; the price was more than reasonable, and political tempers had not yet heated to such an extent that wary wives refused to allow outspoken Republicans or determined Dcms to expose themselves to argu­mentation. It's a mystery . . . that October affair. 

Let nic hasten to repair the damage if I've given the Impression that the October party was a bust. Distinctly not. Measured against similar events held by other groups, or even those staged by the Chicago Club of a number of years ago, it was a definite success. It was merely tliat the club ofTicers had such high hopes for this one. In view of the worthy cause, that it was some%vhat disappointing. Considered by itself, it was a ic­warding get-together. 
I asked President Luke Ticrnan to supply me with a list of the guests when I reported on tlic party In the last issue of the ALUMNUS, so the names given were from his quick recollections (I didn't really give him enough time to come up with a good list.) What struck me at the time was the representation of all parts of the city and a wide range of graduating classes among those present. It's been some months now, so this will necessarily be a sketchy list, but here are a few names to support my claim: 
North Side: Mr. and Mrs. Luke "ncman, *37, John 0'Shaughncss>-, '33, and Mark Mitchell, '39j ^Vest Side: ^Ir. and Mrs. Gil Seaman, '37, Ed Hoban, '48, Ray Durst, '26, and us McCabes; near North Side: the Emmett O'Neills, '48; South Side. Mr. and Mrs. Justin OToole, '36, and a Dumber of others. Including at one table the Frank Hetreeds, '30, and John Goldens, '30, and otliers in that party whose names and faces I have forgotten. Also of couri^e, the hard-working chairrnen and their wives, Prial Curran, *37, and Tom Brennan, MO. Tlie reason I name these people, from all sections of the city, is to use them as examples—If these club members could find energ>- to drive in to the Blackstone, why couldn't others all over Chicago make a similar effort? 
Next on the 1953 program was the Annual Elec­tion Night dinner, which was held at the Sher­man Hotel March 9. The event was directed by chairmen John McGuIrc, '39, and .Art Conrad, *35.

March-April, 195S 
Cincinnati 
The annual Christmas dance wa^ lield in tlie Hall of Mirrors in the NVthcrland Plaza Hotel on December 26, 1952. 
Tlic dance is held annually for the benefit of the Club's scliolarship fund, and is a surc-Hre hi' cacit year. 1952 was no exception. 

Probably one reason for the financial and soria? success of the dance was the planning and hard work of the committee chainnen: John Fcad, '48. and John Brodberger, Jr., '40. scncral ct>-chair­mcn; Ra>inond Gudmens, '47, and Bob Bomkamp, reserx'ations; and Ed Mersman, Jr., '46, patrons. Tlie dance, attended by many friends of Notre Dame in Cincinnati as well as alumni and stu­dents, raised a substantial amount of money toward the scholarship fund. The Club is now supporting two four-year scholarships for students presently attending the University. 
The program featured a cocktail party for a large number of patrons before the dance as well as a floor show during the dance itself. 
Tlie Annual Meeting of the Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce was held at the Hotel Sheraton-Gibson on January* 14. 1953. Tlie featured speaker was Clarence E. **Pat** Manion, formerly dean of the law sctiool. Dean Manion gave a very stirring talk on the challenge facing the new presidential administration. His talk was received enthusiastic­ally by all who attended the meeting. The audi­ence includcc{ Archbishop Karl J. .-Mter as well as business leaders of Cincinnati.

Cleveland 
The Notre Dame-Na\->- football game on Nov. I was one of Cleveland's top attractions in 1952. Principally through the cfTorts of Ed Carej-, '34. and Bill Van Rooy, '32, General Co-Chaimicn for the Nax-y game weekend, the Cleveland Chib's activities were most successful. 
John Reidy. '27, and Flo McCarthy. '32, took over the diairmanship of the pre-gamc pep rally and dance on Friday evening, Oct. 31, in the Rainbow Room of the Carter Hotel. Tlic noted football scout and humorist. Jack Lavcllc, '28. presided as toastmaster for the rally. .-\mong the speakers for the event were ND's Moose Krause, **Rip" Miller of the Na\*al Academy, Mayor Tliomas Burke of Cleveland and sports­caster Joe Boland. 
Bob Stack, '41. was chairman of the .Alumni-Student dance on Saturday evening, Nov. 1, at the Carter Hotel. .-Vn overflow- croud of alumni and students attended. 
Sunday, Dec 7. was the date of the Family Communion Breakfast at the Hollenden Hotel which is held annually in honor of the Immacu­late Conception. Tlic chairmanship of this Break­fast was in the ver\* capable hands of Judge Frank D. Cclebreczc, '25. Rev. Roland Simon-itch, '36, C.S.C. of Notre Dame, was the guest 
•--speaker- for the event. Art Carey, *35, and Jim Uprichard, '33, were co-chairnicn of the annual Christmas dance held at the Statler Hotel Ballroom on Saturday eve­ning, Dec 27. Over 500 donned their full-dress suits for the occasion. On tlic Weekend of Februar>' 20 tti'nugh Febru­ary' 22, the Cleveland Club held its annual retreat for Club members and their guei.ts at the St. Stanislaus Retreat House in Panna. Karl Mar­terstek, '29, was chairman for the affair. It was anotlicr wonderful opportunity for members to strengthen their Faitli, and refrc&h their minds and bodies. Too often wc think only of the body —maintain it, pamper it, rest it—M> that wc can live a full life, provide for our family, progress in our business. But our Soul, which lives for­ever in Heaven or Hell, is seldom given the op­portunity to rest and relax in an environment dedicated to its salvation.

Columbus 
So that our gay metropolis shall not be absent from your columns, here are a few words about Ohio's only capitol. 
Our Communion Breakfast on Dec 7 was a notcwortliy success. INfcmbcrs, their wives and children of Communion age, in a number of 140, • heard words of praise for their dcx-out display under Notre Dame's banner, from ^lonsignor \Vinel, diocesan chancellor, at ^fas5; and words of wisdom and encouragement from Father Nealy, 
Members of the Denver Club Christmas Dance Committee. (L. to R.): John Moran, chair­man of the arrangements committee; Robert J. Flynn; Tony Pojman; and Dr. D. Monaghan. 
O.P., on the Catholic family as our nation's bul­
^^•ark, at the affair. Al Frericks, '41, was chair­
man of this event and with the aid of Joe Ryan, 
'30,, Dr. Joe Hughes, '3!, and Emmett Martin, 
'52, did an en\-iablc job. 
During the Holida>*5, we sponsored a Sunday 

afternoon get-together for alumni, their wives, stu­
dents, their "dates" and parents, St. Mary's girls 
and their parents. It was a highly successful 
party—with the Browns-Lions telecast to comple­
ment the groups that coked and conversed. It 
was a gay turnout and marks, I hope, the begin­
ning of a more intimate relationship between 
students and alumni. Frank >farzoir, '52, was 
chairman of this event. 
At our last club meeting, wc showed the Penn game pictures and had a record attendance. In fact, one gentleman confessed it was the first meeting he had attended in 17 years. At the next meeting, we showed the Oklahoma game pictures and had the same response. If this keeps up, we'll soon be putting our club in the upper ecliclon of Notre Dame's alumni club sc:up.

Detroit 
Many things have come to pa^s for Detroit area alumni since the last issue of the ALUMNUS. In chronological order, they arc: 
The Annual Communion, ^^ass and Btcakrast. arranged chiefly through the work of Jack Rousseau, '47, was held Sunday, Dec. 7, at the beautiful St. ^fao* "f Rcdford Chuich through the perennial courtesy of Msgr. Edw. J. Hlckey. The 90-odd members, wives and children then journeyed out to the historic 117-year-old Bots-ford Inn, formerly owned and operated by IIenr\" Ford and now In the hands of alumni John, '44, and Bill, *5I, Anhuts' family. John, our host, 5er\'ed a breakfast in the best of Botsford tradi­tion. Father Charles E. Shcedy, C.S.C., Dean of the College of Arts and Letters at Xotrc Dame, gave a thought-provoking talk on the little publicized aims—both spiritual and temporal—of the University. 
' On ^[onday night, Dec. 29, Chairman Bub Wink, '50, \vith a big assist from George >\'ebcr, *51, handled the details for the most succf.<»ful Christmas dance held by the club in many years. Two hundred and thirty Student Alumni and friend duets danced to the music of Bill Gatls* orchestra in the main ballroom of the new city Veterans Memorial Building, overlooking the De­troit River. Bob achieved a major victor>' in his campaign to get the "old folks" out, as consider­ably more than the usual number of the oldsters turned out to make it a genuine "club" party. Dress was semi-formal and guests brought re­freshments to suit their personal tastes. 
Xext came an innovation in our social calendar. On Feb. 2, Ed Roncy, *52, put on a "$1 per-alt the beer, pretzels and chips you want" Beer Bust. With the previously enumerated induce­ments, and the "Highlights of '52 games" movies to boot, no end of alumni, friends and fathers turned up at the Banquet Hall of the Veterans Memorial Building for what looks like an annual "night out with the bo>-s." 
Jack Brecn, *33, and Jerr>- iVshIe>-, '33, led a C3pacit>' group of 52 club members out to Man­resa, the local Jesuit Retreat house, over the weekend of Feb. 20-22, the annual first weekend of Lent retreat. Naturally, this is one of the club's most popular and worthwhile get-togethers. 
E. F. Condon, chairman of the field trip com­mittee of the A.S.ALE.'s on the campus brought his lads to town for a four-day stay March 4-8. Through the kindness of a number of alumni and friends they toured G.M., Ford and Chrysler and American Blower operations in the area.

Ft. Lauderdale 
Our local club has been quite active the first two months of the new year. On January 12, we had oui regular monthly meeting in the Orchid Dining Room of the Governor's Club Hotel. As always this affair was a dinner meeting, however, a special note of interest was added in that the main course for the dinner was a whole roasted young porker, handsomely laid out on a large silver tray, dressed in a jaunty cap, with a large red ribbon around his neck, and a large juicy apple placed in its mouth. The porker was sup­plied by Mr. Fred Stewart, the oldest member of the club, and a graduate of 1912 of the Uni­versity. Guests at the dinner included the fol­lowing: Dr. and Mrs. Howard Service, Mr. and Nfrs. R. H. Gore, Jr., Mr. and Mrs. Tom Wagge, Mr. and Mrs. W. Francis Moss, Mr. and Mrs. Walter Crane, Mrs. May A.

. On January 29, the club really outdid itself by throwing a bachelor's dinner for Bob Scott, class of '48. The dinner consisted of roast duckling, with all the other ingredients necessary for a most enjoyable evening. .After dinner Bob was called upon to give his reasons for getting married, and the same were surplasagc since each of us had already met his intended wife. Miss Mary Louisa Smith, a local belle of Fort Lauderdale, and heartily approved his wise judgment. The dinner closed witli eacli and every member giving him a few choice words of advice and wishing him welL 
On Thursday, February 12, the club again held its regular meeting which was a short business meeting. The sole item of business was the an­nouncement, by the election committee, of the results of the ballots wliich had previously been sent out by mail. The ballots showed that yours tPily, of the class of *48, was elected President, Jack Evans, class of '48, was elected vice-presi­dent, John Sullivan, class of '31, was elected secretary, and Andy Propost, class of *50, was elected Treasurer. Honorary officers for the com­ing year are: \\\ Francis Moss, president. Dr. Howard M. Sen-ice, vice-president. Dr. John J. McCalTery, treasurer. As for our future plans, the next item on our agenda in our immediate future is a special luncheon scheduled for March 3, honoring Father Hcsburgh, ivho is presently sojourning in our wonderful climate. You shall hear more of this luncheon, I hope, from the new secretary.

The annual Communion was held Sunday, Dec. 7, at the Cathedral, followed by a Communion Breakfast in the Old Fort Room of the Indiana Hotel. Bbhop Leo A. Pursley was guest speaker. This function has always been one of the most popular functions of the chib, probably because it is the only one which truly brings us together in a common expression of our Faith. This year, liowever, besides being a moving demonstration of our Faith, it was a tribute to Bishop Pursley who has offered his time and effort so many times. 
Georgia 
^fembers of the Georgia Club held an old-fashioned get-together party Friday night, Feb. 20, at Peacock Alley. Several of the new Notre Dame men who have moved into Atlanta since the last meeting showed up and got acquainted. Supper was ser\'ed .for club members and their friends. 
One last, but extremely important, note! If you get down in the direction of Warm Springs, Georgia, be sure to stop for a few minutes to see a Notre Dame lad who is at the >Varm Springs Foundation. His name—Philip G. DcHncke. Phil had polio some 18 months ago and will be very glad to see you. Drop him a card, too, if you get the time. Thanks a lot! We're sure he'll more than appreciate it.

Big news during the holidays was a visit to 
Boise by Father Joseph Powers, C.S.C., '37, who 
is now a member of the history department at 
Portland University. 
Father Powers came to Boise during tlie Christ­
mas vacation to rexiew tlic history of the Boise 
Diocese which His Excellency, the Most Reverend 
Edward J. Kelly, Bishop of Boise, Is preparing 
for publication. 
Father Powers was guest of honor at a com­
bined luncheon of the Xotre Dame and Portland 
University Clubs ol Idaho held at the Studio 
Room of the Hotel Boise, Wednesday, DcC. 31. 
He renewed acquaintances with local alums of both schools. Frank Hicks, '49, remembered Father Powers as his fourth floor Cavanaugh P:e­fecl during Marine V-12 days in 1943. Tom Cooney, '42, had originally met Father Powers in Xew York, where the Cooney family arc neighbors of Fathers brother, Jimmy Powers, Xew York sports writer. 
He took his M..\. in histor>- at Har\-ard and taught .\merican History' at Xotrc Dame and St. Thomas College, St. Paul, Minu., before coming to Portland University in 1951. Father said he likes Idaho very* ni\ich, and hopes t.« come S\.c us again soon. 
Local alums put the bug in Fathei'j ear to get the Congregation of Holy Cross tc Mait a boys* high school here in Boise, where tlie Hnly Cross Sisters have been teaching girls and a few boys for many years. Father said if wc get the voca­tions the order would do it, so now we have to start recruiting. This area is ripe for such a project. The boys need it badly and all the cus­tomers wouldn't be right-handers by any means. 
Plans Were discussed at the luncheon for a pre-Icntcn cabarct-d inner-dance to be held at the Club Chico in Boise. A committee headed by Lee Hazen, '37, and with Jim Quinn, *49, John Mills, *50 (Portland U.), and Phil Shea, '49, as mem­bers, was named to make necessary arrangements for the affair. 
The club is looking forward to receiving the 1952 football highlighu and the technicolor film on Xotrc Darae. We're not in u television area and haven't seen anything except newsrecl briefs of last Fall's games. Television is due in here next Summer, but it wilt be a while before we have any direct network hook-ups. 
Speaking of T\', the membership is proud of the stand Xotre Dame made on the issue before the XCA.-\, and heartily endorse Father Hcsburgh's lO-point program on why our games should be

telecast each week. We especially liked the pro­motional angle involved and what those games mean to the kids of America. The Salt Lake Tribune is giving XD wonderful news coverage on boih the "sucker shift" and *'TV"' issues. John Mooncy, their sports columnist defended ND on the shift question immediately after Mr. Hill made his remarks. We have dropped him a note of thanks, and told him to keep up the good work. 
Wc have scheduled the two films into the four Catholic high schools in the state, and will have special local showings here in Boise %vith appro­priate publicity. 
All of the four Catholic high schools have been contacted and now have the Xotre Dame entrance requirements and informational material about the University on reference in their libraries with guidance people informed. Club members hope to have more Idaho boys applying for entrance to Xotre Dame for this Fall semester. 
Evcr>*one is very happy with the new Univer­sity publication setup, now that they understand how it works. The NOTRE D.\ME Magazine has gone over very well out here. 
We have moved our weekly luncheon meeting place from the ifode Tearoom to the Valencia Dining Room, 612 Idaho Street, Boise. Any Xoirc Dame man travelling through Boise is cor­dially invited to attend these weekly Friday luncheons.

Kansas City 
The first activity to report on is our Communion Breakfast held Sunday, December 7, 1952, at the French Convent, a school for girls conducted by the Sisters of Xotre Dame de Sion. The annual breakfast is certainly the one closest and dearest to the hearts of the alumni here. With the help of-Our.,.Lady. .and.-a .persistent, telephone commit­tee, attendance reached a neiv high this year. There were approximately 38 couples. Father Charles Mullen, S.J., of Rockhurst. celebrated Mass and also gave an inspiring talk on Xotre Dame, the Mother of us all, at the conclusion of the breakfast. Chuck Frizzell and Gene Vandcn Boom were in charge of arrangements and the telephone committee and were assisted by Gene's wife Mary Kay Vandcn Boom, chairman of the X'otre Dame Club Auxiliary* nominating committee. President Dick Bowes took the opportunity to say a few words on the coming Christmas dance and Bob. >retzler gave a challenge to those in attend­ance to make the dance a great success for all alumni. The reaction to his words came quick and with the assistance of Jim Dolan and Bob ^feunie^, a great number of tickets and patrons list subscriptions were taken at the breakfast. 
Thursday, December 4, 1952, will undoubtedly become a ivell remembered date for the X^otre Dome club. TTic groundwork for the formation of a X'otre Dame Auxiliary- club, composed of wives and mothers of X^otre Dame men was laid at a luncheon meeting on that date at BenlsVs Restaurant in the new Twin Oaks apartments. There were wives and mothers of X'otre Dame men present whose sons and husbands hav: seldom been to a X'oire Dame club activity*. Such a dis­play of enthusiasm for Xotre Dame cannot but result in a closely united alumni club. Several laudits for the others. The auxiliary* made plans at their first meeting to adopt a constitution and by-laws. The auxiliary is a determined group and as they grow stronger, the whole club will be­come stronger. 
The first annual Xotre Dame dance for students and alumni and their guests was held on Satur­day, December 27. 1952, In the grand ballroom of the Hotel President. Pages could be written on the background of this dance which accounted for its singular and outstanding success. The two most important reasons were work and coopera­tion. The Committee met three or four times a week for a period of about one month prior to the dance. All members could not be at every meeting but there was always a majority repre­sentation. Practically every* meeting was held at the home of Ed O'Connor, our treasurer, and he deserves thanks not only for his generosity but also for the work and time he put in on the dance. His wife Kathleen deser\'es equal praise for her patience in "coping" with the noise nf the committee and keeping her two young daughters asleep In spite of it, and also, for her gracious hospitality. Cooperation between the members of the committee, the members of the chib, and the Campus club was at an all-time high. Jim DeCoursey, vice-president of the Cam­pus club, was Italson man between that club and the alumni club. He and Paul Rupp, President of the Campus club, are to be commended for 
the almost 100 per cent turnout of students. Paul Rupp and his parents and two couples who were of the auxiliary w-ho request anonymity made this meeting possible, ^^a^y Kay Vanden Boom also requested same but as she was elected chairman of the nominating committee she may take the their guests came all the way from Chilllcothe, Mo., a distance of over 150 miles. 
For foresight, not to mention the great work load he has carried for the club and his overall part In the dance, we commend our president, Dick Bowes, for reserving the space (and on such a choice night) at the President Hotel as early as last June. To George Kopp, general chairman of the Dance Commiltpe, congratulations are due for the overall success of the dance, and for steering the committee members In the right direction and seeing to It that each phase was brought to the proper conclusion. Congratulations arc also due to Dick Prezebel for the unselfish donation of his time and work in making up the Invitations and

A special congratulations to Kusscll Farrell for his solicitation of patrons. Without these patrons it would have been im­possible to have the dance because of cost. Russ gave freely of his lime and his success in pro­curing a great number of the patrons went a long way in making the dance a financial success. Tliere arc many who are deserving of credit for the success of tlie dance, those who worked on the various committees, and otliers, including the aiuiliary who aided the committee members and to cx-er^' one of them grateful thanks (or a jr.b well done.

December 7. 1952, was a banner day for the New Jersey Notre Dame Alumni Association, both morning and afternoon. Over 300 Club members and friends filled the Communion Rail at the 8:30 Mass in St. John's Cathedral in Paterson where Monsignor W. Hill, pastor, directed his sermon and welcome to all members. These Communions were offered in memory of the 334 Notre Dame men who gave their lives to their country during World War H. Tlie turnout filled the hall at the Alexander Hamilton Hotel in Paterson where the Club was addressed by Archbishop-designate Thom­as A. Boland, S.T.D., and Re\-erend John H. Mur­phy, C.S.C., of the University. Patt Barnes, radio, stage, and T\'' star, was on hand to add a light touch, followed by the inimitable famed son of Notre Dame and Coach of the New York Uni­versity football squad, Hugh Dc\'orc.

sianaing success was the direct result of plenty of hard work by Chairman Joe Abbott, with an assist by "Doc" (Dr.) P. M. Pnivissiero on the tickets and arrangements, and the able Toast­master for the morning, Anthony Conti. 
That afternoon wc saw the culmination of Jack Adams* tireless efforts in an indoctrination pro­gram for local high school students interested in attending the University of Notre Dame. Illness kept Jack away from the proceedings but Jack Bums, *34, who has recently come into vur jurisdiction, was on hand with two tables full of literature, facts and figures, to answer the inquiries of the students. Approximately 180 high school boys saw the motion picture about Notre Dame life, heard an impromptu pep talk by George Keenan, and were 5cr\'cd refreshments by the young ladies of the Lacordairc School in Upper Montclair where the meeting was held. We all received an unexpected treat by hanng the President of the University, Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C., present for an inspiring speech about tlic spiritual aspect of Notre Dame life. 
Father Hesburgh took time from a busy sched­ule to appear at the reception and speak to the high school boys. He was joined on the speakers* platform by Joe BjTne, Jr., '15, Ray Troy, *34, and Tom Greene, *49. Greene represented Leo 
J . Costello, '49, New Jcrsc>' Club President, who was unable to attend. 
Father Hesburgh, who spoke earlier in the da> at the New York Club's Communion Breakfast wzs accompanied by Ne\%* York Club President Herb Giorgio, '32. 
Hostesses for the event were the young ladies of the Senior Class of Lacordairc School. They assisted in serving refreshments which followed showng of the campus color movie. 
Joe Bj-mc, Jr., has also been responsible for the support given Jim Frick of the University of Notre Dame Foundation Campaign. On January* 13 Jim was out here for a "Kick-OfT* Club meeting for the new Campaign Fund. 
The New Jersey Club is pointing for its next annual event, Universal Notre Dame Night in April. Preparations will be made in the forth­coming meetings and there is some talk about let­ting the ladies in on this one, making it a "co-ed" affair.

Philadelphia 
The ne%v year brings our thanks to the ALUM­NUS for keeping us up-to-date on the Notre Dame news throughout the world. Wc assure you Philadelphia is still a part of it. 
Universal Notre Dame Sunday, December 7, 1952, was once again obser\'ed by Notre Dame men and their families by celebration of the Mass at St. John's. The presence of the Most Re\crend John F. O'Hara, C.S.C, Archbishop of Philadel­phia at the Mass was our special honor. His sermon was especially directed to our sons, the Notre Dame men of the future, whose priwlcgc it may some day be to continue pursuit of their education beneath the vale of Our-Lady-of-the­Golden-Dome. A Holy Communion Breakfast fol­lowed at the .Adclphia Hotel, and the club pre­sented its annual trophy to the outstanding foot­ball player from the Catholic League for the season of 1952. 
Bob Glascott, husky All-State fullback , formally accepted the University of Notre Dame Club of Philadelphia Trophy as the most valuable player in the league at exercises held in tlic Roman Catholic High School Auditorium. Tlie school will retain possession of the trophy for the current year. 
The presentation was made by John P. Demp­sey. Club President, who stressed the fact that the Notre D.'mic Alumni group, while quite in 2^eement ^%*ith the result, had nothing to do with choosing the winner. Selection, he said, is made by a vote from the eight boys from the Catholic Football X-eague selected by their own squads as being the most valuable. In this way the winner is really a **players* player." 
A. F. *'Bud" Dudley spoke alarmingly against the dropping of football by so many of the colleges. Dudley stated that this move forced athletes into the larger, already crowded state universities to the detriment of the private col­leges who could use athletic publicity to help their enrollments. 
Other Speakers at the ceremonies included Rev. Fred Moors, Athletic Director at Roman Catholic High School, who accepted the award in behalf of the school, Clifford E. Prodehl, Vice-President of the Notre Dame Club, and John H. Nceson, Jr., local attorney. President of the .Vational Alumni Association of the University of Notre Dame. 
Notre Dame men in Philadelphia were indeed very happy to receive tlie news that John H. Necson, Jr., '35, has been elected President of the Notre Dame Alumni Association. All who know John realize what a truly great Notre Dame man he is, t 
Another Notre Dame man in the PJiilade'phia area has assumed a position of interest. Ambrose 

*'Bud" Dudley- was recently appointed Athletic 
Director at VilIano\-a College which is located 
sn the Main Line just outside Philadelphia. Wc 
understand his presence v%'as felt at the recent 
NCAA meetings in Washington. 

The January* meeting of our Club gavf us the 
cfKcers for 1953. Jack Dempsc>', '49, assumes 
the role of President, QifT Prodehl, Vice-Presi­
dent, John H. Neeson, Jr., Treasurer, John Voit, 
Secretary, John Kinney*, Assistant Treasurer, and 
Walt Phillips, Assistant Secretary'. 

^fcntion must be made here of the **Arch­
bishop's Committee for Christian Home and Fam­
iiy." This committee, organized on a Parish 
basis, was inaugurated by our new Archbishop, 
John F. O'Hara, C.S.C., *'to encourage and foster 
the spiritual development of each and every cliild 
from Baptism until entrance into school and the 
guidance of our Parochial school Nuns." 

That about covers the nc^v•5 of interest from the 
Philadelphia area. Looking forward to itie next 
edition of the ALU.MNUS.

Phoenix 

The Club incited their families and friends of the University to view the sound movies covering the work of LOBUND and the various colleges on the campus.

Peter Flaherty and Hugo Yacavet were co-chair­men for this affair. 
Tlie Pittsburgh Club's Board of Governors re­cently decided to channel the proceeds of the annual Christmas dance into its Student Scholar­ship Fund. This year's dance yvss held en De­cember 26 at the University Club in Pittsburgh and was both a social and financial success. Most of the credit is deserved by Bob Slocum and Lee Kirby for their work on the tickets and Earl Brieger for his work in soliciting patrons. 
The annual retreat for the Pittsburgh Club was held at St. Paul's Retreat House over the week­end of January 9, 10, and 11. Attendance records were shattered as 75 Notre Dame men and their friends from this area took time ofF to '^retreat from the world." George Kingsley was tlie re­treat promoter. 
The Family Communion Breakfast was held on March 1 at the Sacred Heart Church School Lunchroom in the East End. The guest speaker was Father Fintan R.

Rhode Island 

The Catholic Alumni .Assoda'.ion Communion Breakfast, which was originated by John Mc­Laughlin, '34, and Bishop McVinnej- of the Rhode Island Club back in 1947 when the Bishop was our club chaplain, u-as again a tremendous suc­cess this year. 
The small turnout for individual college Com­munion Breakfasts was what prompted the idea. Each year, now, finds a difTercnt college acting as host. This entitles tlic Alumm of tiie College to select their own speaker, et c Wc were on the docket last year and also in 1949. It stands at a Notre Dame project and we hope someday to sec the attendance exceed 1.000 Catholic Alumni Communicants. 
Wc had a nice visit from Father Murphy in December and one from "Moose" Krause and his wife two weeks ago. 
Rochester

About 150 couples attended on what was the coldest night of the year in these parts. 
Our last regularly scheduled meeting was post­poned two weks to February 9, to coincide with the visit to Rochester of Jim Fricfc of the Notre Foundation. It was a joint meeting with the Women's Auxiliary, and to accommodate the ex­pected large turnout, the site of the meeting was changed to the Notre Dame Retreat House. The time as usual, 8:30 p.m. The film. Highlights of 1952, u*as shown. 
The club regrets that Notre Dame has discon­tinued its basketball rivalry with Canisius College, as it has deprived us of our excuse for the annual trip to Buffalo. 
Rocliester Club President \^c DeSimon, '46, has opened up his own law office in the Exchange Building and is now in open competition with the scores of other ND grads in the area. 
The Chairman for Universal Notre Dame Night has been selected. He is Bob Odenbach, '40. Date has been set as April 18. Those are all the plans so far. 
Flans are now under^vay for an Open House to be held before Lent. This is to be a joint opera­tion with the Women's Auxiliary. Details remain to be completed.

One tiling that would really help the Club and expedite communications is a complete, up-to-date roster of membership. Tlie one wc have now is so marked up and has been corrected so many times that it seems to be beyond repair. There­fore, I am asking the following men to help In the formulation of an actnirate mailing list, each handling the areas as marked: 
Lafayette and West Lafayette: Balfe ^Vagner and John Bodic; Nortli: Paul. Kennedy and Joe Campagna (this Includes Fowler-Oxford area); South: Ray Swanson and Bill Rimgc (Crawfords­\illc and rural areas); Northeast: Dick Haugh and Bryan Crosby (Delphi area). 
Phil Sheridan, '39, has come up with a wonder­ful idea, namely, that as many members as pos­sible sign up to give a pint of blood when llic Bloodniobile next visits Lafayette. 
Tlie club Intends to have a datiier-partv f-ir members, wives and guests on UND Night, April 13.

Ron O'Neill 1350 No. Black Oak Dr. South Bend 17, Indiana 

11 YOU %*7ll reply to your new 5ecretar>-*s appeal (whicli will reach you eventually] as promptly as did the first 12 queried, nc\'cr will the ALUMNUS fail to carry news of the great class of '14. 
First to report was CHARLES E. ("GUS") DORAIS, co-inventor with KNUTE ROCKNE (another *14 graduate) of modem football. Gus, long-time coacli at the University of Detroit and former Detroit alderman, ekes out a liring by master-minding the sale of Che\Tolels from his agency at Wabash, Indiana. Fortunate in mar­riage, a special blessing seemingly conferred on all men of '14, Gus and his charming wife live in a delightful rural setting on the outskirts of W^abash, with the youngsters nearby. 
RAY MILLER'S letter came in the next mail. 
Ray reminds us that wliile there was only one class of '14, wc did have many friends among the classes of '13. *15 and '16, and that news of them would be welcome. Witli Ray in Cleveland is *'NIG" KANE, manager of Bulkle>-'s, one of the big downtown garages. JOE SMITH (who stayed over to be graduated in law in '16) and HUGH O'NEILL (he's tlic wealthy O'Neill) who operates some 42 trucking companies out of of­fices in the Terminal Tower. Ray says little of himself, but his outstanding successes arc well known to most of his classmates, and no surprise to us who remember his scholastic ability and attainments. 

Wc ^vere delighted to hear from two classmates wc last saw on the lawn beneath the big mag­nolia tree in front of the main building the night brforc our commencement, LOU EICK and EM­MET WALTER. Lou is an officer and general manager of the Fenray Photoplay Company which operates a chain of theatres in and around Mar­tins Fcrrv*, Ohio. He lists his assets, in typical '14 fashion, as "a dex-otcd wife, a married daugh­ter, two fine grandchildren, a boy and a girl . . . and somewhat less than a million dollars." 
M. Emmett Waller (as we recall, he ran Ray Milter a tough race for scholastic honors back in '14) forwarded a newspaper clipping that A*-as a joy to read. The clipping concerned Emmett's citation as the outstanding Catholic Ia>'man of Houston, Texas, by the National Conference of Christians and Jews. 
Digging deeper, we've learned that Emmett planted his roots in Houston about four years after graduation, joining the Houston Post as a reporter, and becoming assistant city editor of the Chronicle two years later. Today, Emmett is-editor of the Houston Chronicle. Tlierc seems hardly to have been a civic enterprise in Houston since Emmett located there, including the City Planning Commission of which he is \-ice-chair­
man, with whicIi he has not been identified. One of his greater satisfactions must have come in 1S50. when Pope Pius honored him by making him a Knight of St. Gregory, 
Lamenting the fact that the class of '14 is made up of the world's most delinquent letter wTiters, Emmett remarked that he recently had a letter from JIM ROBBINS, mayor of Nogales. Though he and Jim were pals in '14, Emmett says this is but the second letter he's received from Jim since their graduation. We missed Jim on our trip to the west coast a few years ago, and sincerely hope he'll break down, upon reading this, and write us. 
Lest the editor blue-pencil this report too free­ly (Ed. Note: It's a fine job you've done this issue. Professor. J.C.), we'll hold the interesting letters from ED LARNEY. NIG KANE, SIM FL.-\NAG.\N and others until the next issue. Meanwhile, don't u-ait for your request, let us 
Father Joseph Powers, C.S.C., '37, guest of honor at a comhined luncheon meeting of the Notre Dame and- Portland University Almnni Cluhs of Idaho, chats over dessert with a group of the memhcrs. Seated (L. to R.) are: John Mills and President Jim Bruce of the Portland Almnni; and Frank Hicks, Leonard Eisenman, President Paul Kohout, Fr. Powers, T. J. Jones, Jr., and Jess Hawley, all ND^ers.

students. 
It is with deep regret that I report to the 
members of our class that within the last four 
months three of our fellow class members have 
passed to their rc^vard. 
RICHARD V. HYLAND, 17 Park Mc, Xciv York 21, N. Y., who graduated in Civil Engi­neering, died September 20, 1952. His wife sur­\-ive$ him, and I am sure that she would appre­ciate a letter, particularly from those of his classmates w-ho kne%^ Richard on the campus. 
LEO J. HOFFMAN, 514 .Angela Blvd.. South 
Bend, Ind., died August 6, 1952. He also leaves 
his wife. 
P.\UL FRANCIS SWIFT, 1115 Old Orchard 
Ave., Dayton, Ohio, died August 28, 1952. His 
wife sur%'ives him. A letter from his classmates 
would certainly be appreciated in all cases. 
This year ^vc should make a special effort to attend our 35-year reunion next June, for who knows what another 5 years will bring? Your sug­gestion as to a program for our reunion will be more than welcome. One suggestion has been presented for all alumni. It has been suggested that a laymen's retreat be organized for Sunday and Monday following graduation. Your opinions on this matter would be of great interest. 
In looking over the files I note that in the past three years since I have been acting as Secretary', I have received information from only 32 of approximately 100 living graduates, and I ^vonder if the 69 . who have failed to answer would not take this occasion to wTite at least a postcard to your Secretary, and give a little bit of information concerning your activities dur­ing the past 33 years, and best of all, assure your classmates that you will be on hand on June 12, 13 and 14, 1953, to rehash old times with your classmates. 
From time to time in the columns of the ALUMNUS and by mailing items, we will ac­quaint you with the Information from these cards, but the most cheering thing to your classmates will be a note from you that you w*ill be on hand next June. So the present order of busi­ness is, 
1.
 Circle the dates on your calendar. 

2.
 Drop a card to your Secretary telling that you will be there and adding any information to it that will assist us in keeping the column In­terest for the next few months. 


To add interest to our reunion a trophy will be given to the alumnrus present at the reunion, who has the most grandchildren (great grand­children w*ill count double). To get tl\,e contest started how about some cards giving the names of your grandchildren or better yet, enclosing a snapshot of them.

One of the class chaplains, FATHER P.\T HAGGERTY, C.S.C., sent us a Christmas card from Holy Cross High School, New Orleans. Father Pat indicated he expects to be at his new address for an extended period. 
HxVROLD ^VEBER and wife Luclle were plan­ning a trip to Mexico in January or February. Harold reports that the Oklahoma football game at ND last fall was the greatest game there in the last decade and he should know for seldom, if ever, does he miss a game at South Bend. Harold reports a vbit with RALPH CORYN at Alby*s Restaurant, South Bend, after the Southern Cal game, also a phone chat with PAUL McDER-MOTT of St. Paul. We are pleased to mention the ^Vebers had a Mass said for CHARLIE HIRSCHBUHL, deceased, during the Christmas hoIida>*s. 
DXS YOUNG still has at least nine more months to go on his present assignment for Foley Brothers Company atop the Chilean Andes. He listened to the ND football games on the Armed Forces radio program. Dan was able to return to the U. S. for his mother's funeral. He had a \-isit with GEORGE and PAUL McDERMOTT in the old home city. 
FATHER GEORGE FISCHER, C.S.C., surely registered a smash hit with his ''Nostalgia" which appeared In the 1922 column of the No< x-smber-Decembcr Issue of the ALUMNUS. One man from another class wTOte In to say that nothing he had read in the .ALUMNUS or else­where In the past 30 years has so vividly brought back the golden memories of life at ND In his campus days as has the masterpiece from the tj-pewriter of Father George. 
DR. EDDIE ^VNDERSON had another success­ful football season at Holy Cross College, losing only two contests by close scores to Syracuse University and Quantico Marines. The coach was honored in a very special way in being selected as an assistant coach of the East football team for the East-^Vcst Shrine classic in San Francisco. 
BUCK SIL\\\*, football coach of the profes­sional San Francisco 49'ers, got his team off to a splendid start In early season, but the 49*ers after soundly defeating the Detroit Lions on two occasions got stuck In the mud, or something, and could not extricate themselves. Curiously enough the Detroit Lions went on to win the professional championship.

"The Miracle t»f Thirty-Fourth Street" has nothing on JOHN J. RYAN, that well known class secretary of the class next to the best class. John gives me more ne^vs about the class of 1923 than the whole class put together. This time the news is so good that your class secre­tary has decided on what he thinks will be unique. You fellows are too bashful to write about yourself. I wish you would get some dope on a fellow classmate and send it In and we will start a "1925 Hall of Fame" or "The Man of This Issue." At least we will have a fine beginning because this fellow started out as the secretary of your class and as you remember was the editor of *'The Dome** during our Junior year . . . yep, JOHN W. SO^LLAN, better known to you as '*Jack." I kne^v Jack back In the days of 1920 when most of you fellows knew Notre Dame as a university you hoped to go to. We were In the last **prep school'* class that Notre Dame ever had and the only one that ever got **prep school" class rings. That*s the only order that JOHN HURLEY took that he didn't make a profit on. That was the beginning of the Hurley-Cunningham Co. .. . Jn%'elry, Photos and Dance Programs. Cunningham came into the picture the following year . . . our Fresh­man year. Getting back to Scallan .. . did you kno%v that Jack was a boxer and basketball player? He was the captain of the Junior Notre Dame prep team and will remember a glamor­ous Sunday afternoon when the team traveled to far off Hammond, Ind., and played the Catholic High school there . . . and beat them. PERCY 
AVILCOX was the coach and your "sec'* was the student manager so we **made the trip** and 
March-April, 1953 

got two free meals out of it. Jack is out of that *'}unior'* class now and lie's our "Man of This Issue." Our star reporter, JOHN RYAN, '26, sent me this report ivhich was in tlic "Wall Street joumar* of January* 26, 1953. 
"Pullman, Inc. (Chicago) JOHN W. SCAL­LAX, vice-president in charge of Midwestern sales . since t 1944, was promoted to vice-president and general manager of Pullman-Standard Car 
Jack Scallan 

Manufacturing Ct*., a subsidiary' of PuUnian, Inc. Mr. Scallan joined Pullman Co.^ then a sleeping car operating subsidiary* of Pullman Inc., in 1926. In 1928 he became a sales agent of Pullman Car & ^lanufacturing Co., which is nou* Pullman-Standard. In 1942 be was named as :iss!stant vice-president. Two years later be became vice-president." What the "Wall Street Journal" did not tell you is that this grand gentleman married Margaret Cavanaugb, ' St. Mary's, and that tlio' have a Avondcrful family. Jack has given a help­ing hand through the years to many a Xotre Dame man and has given amply of his time lo tlic Notre Dame Club of Chicago as its presi­dent and on the board of directors. A perfect Catholic gentleman who has reached the lop .. . congratulations Jack from the fellows who proudly sav "I knew Jack when." We arc happy to make you "THE 1925 MAN OF THIS ISSUE." 
Well boys, bring them on .. . I might add "girls" because I think the wives • will , come through with the information and a photograph of the man they took *"for better or for worse."

Tlie news letter which went to the class recently was productive of a few replies. I hope this colunm brings a few more, for that is the only way it can exist. Tlie address is still the same —the mailman delivers mail ever\- day—the mail­box is large enough (now that the Christmas bills zre out of the way) to hold all the letters you fellows can send with the dope on yourselves and our classmates. So, keep 'cm rolling. 
First of all—ADD '26 Sons— BILL FOOHEY wrote that his son. Bill, Jr., is a freshman. DR. HAROLD CAREY wrote from his Lan­caster, Wis., hospital that he was interested in the stor>* of the *26 Sons as bis two sons often speak of boys at ND whose fathers knew him. His son, Terry, is a Senior in Dillon Hall, and 
Denny is a freshman in Zahm Hall. Harold sat next to ROG NOL^VN at the Oklahoma game. State Representative A. V. (TONY) CAPANO 
v.-ritcs from Harrisburg, Pa., that he backed the November landslide (secretar>-'s words) and re­turned to the Pa. General Assembly after ha\-ing scrx'cd there in 1947. He writes that be has no son for ND but figures he might send his only daughter t<t suinincr scliool. Tony says he is looking forttfard to '56 and hopes, God willing, 
that we have as good a showing as *51. From East Orange comes a letter from TOM­MY FARRELL—with news—big news, as Tommy puts it, as follows: "JERRY HAYES will have to surrender his 'biggest man in the dass' title. A few weeks back, a not so dormant hernia kicked up and he had to have it operated on quickly. So under a special anesthetic and surrounded by three obstetricians, one orthopedic, one heart man, and. as I put it, 'one doctor' thc>- went to work on him while patient and M.D.'ers wisi^^a^cked back and forth. But the operation was successful and the big news is that Jerr\' shed 17 pounds 
while in the hospital and promises to have-a sylph-like figure of 2(K) pounds before he stops siirtnking." 
Tommy says that WINK WINGERTER is now 

living in Jacksonville, Fla., hut better be drawl-
Icss when he returns to Jersey. 
BERT DUNNE WTIICS that he has almost re­covered from the serious operations he had last April. Bert writes that he staffed TV shows in October and is spending his time writing—TVj Radio, and a book. Tlic book, "I Died on Every Pitcli" (your secretary* has a new job as volun­teer press agent) is about 120,000 words of base­ball, one-fourth being ND. Ought to be good. Bert says he recently saw ex-quarterback EDDIE SCHERER, and also saw BOTTS CROUXEY, '27, at the baseball meeting in Phoenix. 
Speaking of seeing, your secretary- bumped into JIM GLYNN in the bookstore at one of the games last Fall. Jim is General Sales Manager for National Container Corp. of Indiana in Indianap­olis. .At the Northwestern basketball game on Nc\c Year's Eve I also saw JIM RONAN and STEVE PIETROWICZ. Haven't seen or talked to Prcs. Rv\Y DURST or Treas. GEORGE HARTNETT recently. 
As I wrote the foregoing I noticed that one of H.AROLD CAREY'S boys is named "Denny," v.-bicli recalls that my son, Denny, is scheduled for return from his second Japanese "visit" in ?v[arcli. Your secretary will be happy to sec him hanging up the soldier suit, forever I hope, and also will be pleased to hear Mike and Pat (whom he hasn't yet seen) learn that the old gray-baired bird is not their father, but their grandfather. 
.•\nd with that personal note, I run dry. But no column can be c<miplete without "PLAN TO MIX IN '56."

Sixty of 73 eminent members of the class of *29 said "yes" to the recent query: "Do you plan to attend the 25th year class reunion in June. 1954?" Another six said *'I hope to attend." 
Ic has been suggested that as the time of our reunion approaches a list of those expectirg to attend be furnished to each of you. The names of most of those contributing to this issue will appear thereon. 
We have arranged the returned questionnaires in alphabetical order and have submitted them to the editor of the ALUMNUS for use in this column. Should our allotted space be exhausted before we reach KARL WOLFRAM we will continue our material in the next issue. Tliank you for your response—which means "if you haven*t returned your questionnaire as yet, please do so promptly.** 
REV. HENRY B. ALTNfrVNX, St, Raphael's Church, Glasgow, Mont., writes: "Have been here for almost six years, and during that time have built a school and gym for grades. This is our fourth year of school in it. Have 180 youngsters. I went to the Eucharistic Congress at Barcelona, Spain. Met ARCHBISHOP 0*HARA there. Spent three moiiths in Europe. Ver>' .glad to get back home though for various reasons. Ha! (I was broke by that time.) Larr>-, I would really love to get back for a \'i5it. I w*ouId like it much better if I could be there for one of the games. ^faybe next year. PAT MANIOX certainly gave a beautiful talk before the election. .A number of people heard him and were ver>' much impressed with it." 
"Definitely, yes!" was the way PETE BRYS­SELBOUT of 1400 Cornell, Bay City, Mich., put it in answering the aforementioned question. He adds: "I've been married 17 years and have been practicing architecture on my own since 1940. Am president of the Saginaw Valley Chap­ter of American Institute of Architects, director of the Michigan Society of Architecw. and past presi­dent of the Saginaw Valley Notre Dame Club. I was lucky enough to see the N. Carolina and Afichigan State games this year, but didn't see a single '29er either time. Too bad we can't have 3 common meeting place, so that you could see your classmates at games on the campus. Missed the 20ih reunion but am making 1954 a 'must.* A directory of '29 class so we could write a few friends might help the interest." 

BOB BUST of 21 D St., S.W., Ardmore, Okla., who is at present construction superintendent for Stone Construction Co. in Fort Worth, Texas, and has a son, William, studying for the priest­hood at St. Benedict's Abbey, Shawnee, Okla., is keeping a steady flame under the Fighting Irish spirit down there as he writes: '^Ashamed to tell this, but since we beat Oklahoma last season, the alibis have been terrible around here. Let's do it again next September!" Bob had only three words in answer to our Httlc question—^"Yes! And how!" 
WILLIAM F. CRAIG, of Granville Pike, ifun­cie, Ind.. and vice-president of the Tri-Cit>- Radio Corporation there, tells us he has his time pretty well cramped operating radio stations WLBC, WMUX, and WLBC-TV. Bill, who has a son at ND in the Sophomore class, is president of the Green Hills Country Club. Trustee of St. Lawrence Church and ''currently chairman of a drive to raise funds to build a liew high school for St. LaAvrcnce. I raise wire fox terriers and show them for a hobby .. . fly my Tri-Pacer Airplane for business and hobby.

As you '29ers well know, FRxVN'CIS GUSHING spent the last two years on two vcr>' interesting foreign contracts in French Morocco and Southern Greenland. Both encounters, howex'er. made him bedridden for fairly lengthy periods. At present, he is in Westficid State Sanatorium, Westfield, Mass., tr>'ing to recover in time for the reunion. He writes: "It looks like this will be my per­manent address during all of 1953 and until the Spring of 1954. At any rate, I hope that I shall be out in time for our silver anniversary class reunion on the campus in June of '54. Patients enjoy receiving mail to break the monotony of being bedridden.

president of the Children's Bureau 
board of directors. 
"Mr. Mac" as he is popularly known, 
came to Memphis in 1902 from Brook­
lyn and became associated with Ger-

ber's Department Store where he is 
now vice-president. He is a member 

of the 1893 Class at Notre Dame. He 
has served the Children's Bureau as 
president since 1939 and has been a 
member of the board since 1928. 
Two years ago he received an award from Negro leaders in Memphis for outstanding citizenship and in 1944 he was one of 25 men selected from throughout the nation to ser\'e on the board of the Child Welfare League of America. "Mr. Mac" has also been ac­tive in the Knights of Columbus, the St. Vincent de Paul Society and num­erous other fund-raising campaigns. He is City Chairman for the Notre Dame Foundation in Memphis. 
Mr. McPhillips and his wife are the parents of three daughters and one son. 
order to keep it flowing. Also, any of the fel­lows, especially from our class of '29 arc alu-ax-s welcome to \-isit with me. After three months, I have yet to ^receive my first visitor ... " 
All of the inaugural hallyballoo in Washington recently was nothing but a headache for GAY­LORD P. HAA6 . who wTites from his office as Signal Officer in the Military* District there: "Someone put the finger on me to ser\*e on the Inaugural Committee—heaping more headaches oa an already weary soul. ROBERT ^VEPPNER, who started in our Freshman class in the School of Architecture, w*on the prize for the design of the presidential inaugural reviewing stand to be built in front of the White House. He came from Cleveland with the rest of our gang. .. . I look forward to again seeing you and the many other fellows of the class of '29 at the reunion in June." 
JOE HARTNETT, JR., 56 Archer Dr., Bronx-ville, N. Y., ivrites that he's just killing time until the reunion in June. "I'm -with Ir\'ing Trust Co. now, and have beea since 1946 after my hitch with Uncle's Navy. My interests: work^ gardening, fishing, camping, nieces and nephews. . . . No startling experiences in war or in peace . . . just want to sec the 'boys' in June." Joe was recently promoted from assistant secre­tary of the Irving Trust Co., to assistant vice-president. 
JIM KENNEDY, of 7360 X. AVolcott, Chicago, startled us w-ith an interesting little item (al­though it's getting to be quite the vogue in his household): "Eileen Terese Kennedy {No. 11), arrived on Dec. 7, weighing in at 10 lbs. 10 ounces. We now have six girls and five boys. 
I don't believe children arc cheaper by the dozen, but they arc a lot more fun in a large family-being an only child, I know now what I missed. Son Jim, 17, won his football letter at St. George High School in Evanston this year, playing tackle on a squad referred to as the lightweights—He is 180 lbs. (The hea^y boys make up the varsity squad.) This school turns out some good football players almost every year—iWRTY W*ENDELL and LARRY COUTRE are the best known at ND. I would appreciate your remembrance at Mass, of my mother, who passed away at the age of 90 in N'ovember." 
BILL KEIEG of Indianapolis, writes that he had a small-scale reunion of his own recently at his home there: "This gathering was occasioned by the visit east of JIM BRADY and his wife, Marian. Jim is a big radio station owner and operator in Idaho Falls, Idaho. Those present at my home were JOHNNY HARRINGTON, who is a C.P.A. and a partner of George S. Olive & Co. of Indianapolis; BILL O'CONNOR, presi­dent and general manager of the wholesale gro­cery concern of M. O'Connor and Co. of Indian­apolis; BOB NE^VBOLD, Deputy United States ^[arshaIl for Southern Indiana; JACK ELDER, who is now a big cog with Sinclair Oil Co., Indianapolis, and JOHNNY ROCAP, of the class of *30, who is very successfully engaged in the law practice here. You can gauge the success of the reunion from the fact that while the invi­tations for the Tea stated 5 to 7 p.m., Brady and Elder were still arguing about the 1938 Army game in my library at midnight. Jack Elder claimed he won the game and Jim Brady claimed he won the game. I claimed Notre Dame would have been better off without both of them. In any event, we had a wonderful time. While I 
sec the Indianapolis group frequently and gener­ally go west to fish with Jim Brady every other year, I hadn't seen Jack Elder since graduation. Jack looks wonderful and hasn't gained much weight." 

HUGH McMANIGAL, owner and operator of the Acme Construction Co., Keys Construction Co., and Keys Builders Supply Co. in Miami, Fla., tells us that he threw a television party for the Notre Dame-Oklahoma game and GEORGE BRAUTIGAM and JERRY OUELETTE were there. "I am just beginning t^vo months* vacation at my place down on the Keys. I'm looking forward to fishing and boating and s^vim­ming .. . have a pool dug out of coral rock and a 24-foot deal ^vith 200 horses! Can't wait for that reunion in June to see all of the '29 boys." The only suggestion as to arrangements for the affair that Hugh could work up was that wc get 100 per cent attendance. 
GEORGE MONROE, an automobile dealer in Frecport, III., gives us an up-to-date run.do\v-n of his family: *'My wife, Dorothy (no age allowed to be given) and I have John ^[artin, 4, and Mary Theresa, 5, both of whom wc adopted. I saw *PINKIE CASSIDY of Bay St. Louis, La., who is now assistant superintendent of the Texas Co. for southern United States with offices in New Orleans. Sure would like to hear from PHIL TOMPKINS, DON McCOLL or HARRY POR­TER. I just happened to be fottunate enough to see the Oklahoma game this year. It took me 
back to the Northwestern game of '26 in mem­ories. 1 am still plugging away at selling Chcv­rolcts here in old Frecpori, but in my spare moments I always manage to get togcllier with other members of the Rock River Valley Club. JOE BITTORF, of Sterling, III., has for the past several years generously allowed the club to use his beautiful summer home on the Rock River as the scene of our annual picnics. 
JACK McCLAREN, 4515 Tivoli St,, San Diego, Calif., tells us he has three children now* . . . Kay, 18, Tom, 12, and Melissa, 8 months. "1 saw EMMETT McCABE, who is now A*-ith Con­\'air in San Diego, recently. While FATHER LOUIS THORNTON was out here during a \-isit I had a lew words witli him. Others I've seen recently include G. R. BILL, now a real estate broker in San Diego; and BILL CRONIN, who is with Frigidairc in San Francisco, Tell tiic boys the>* can keep me away from their games with U.S.C." Jack writes, "I've seen five since leaving ND and have never seen them win one. I got married in 1933 to Katherinc Fishbum, of Carthage, Mo., and we drove 'up to see the USC game that year on our honeymoon. I'm afraid she thought I had oversold the brand of football played by Notre Dame. Despite the fact, things have turned out for the best, though. If it's at all possible, I'll sure be tlierc for the reunion in June." 
PETER MORGAN, a track coacli in Trenton. 

N. J,, (his address—21 N. Linope Ave.) informs us he has two boys and a girl now: Judy. 12: Peter, II; and Felice. 6. "I hope to sec BILL and JOHN BROUTs', and BILL BYRNE at the reunion in June. JACK REILLY, TOM KENNEALLY and LEO HUGHES are among the few *29ers I've seen lately." 
Space and time are fast dropping to the minimum point, but one last reminder: If you baiixn't returned your questionnaire, please do so immediately. IVe want to get the full dope on all of you for the next issue of the ALUMNUS, and particularly your plans for the big reunion here on the campus in June, 1954!

James T. Doylc 6457 No. Bell Avenue Chicago 45, IIHDOIS 
RE^VARD A substantial reu-ard will be offered to Class of 1931 Alumni for current news and statistics of their classmates. Rush replies to Jim Doyle, 6457 N. Bell Avenue, Chi­cago 43, Illinois. 

Our class was known as the "Depression Class" back in the dark thirties, but it must be the most prosperous and busiest today. Judging from the few who found time to send news for our column. \Vc can thank the ALUMNUS and the Alumni Association for bringing us up to date on ART McMANMON. JACK SAUNDERS and CHARLIE CUSH\VA. It was good to see their pictures and we can all say that time has done them well. I think our two "Bay-Staters" ought to get letters ofT promptly as they were two of my most enthusiastic supporters at the reunion In 1951. 
Among those seen at the Oklahoma game were: AL STEPAN, FRANCIS "DOLLY" GANNON, SPIKE SULLIVAN, TO.M MONAHAN, GENE COYLE, JIM McQUAID, BEN OAKES, JIM GRIFFIN, ED RYAN, KELLY POAVERS, CLEM TYSON, OLLIE PO\VERS. Spike Sulli\-an and Tom Monahan managed to have a suite at the Morris Inn where I spent a pleasant hour after the game. 
During October I stopped at Sturgis, Midi., and had a ver>' Interesting \4sit ^v-itli BOB NEYDON. He looks very well after a prolonged and serious illness. Bob is manager of the Mar­vel Industries plant and spends his spare time nmnjng his farm a few miles out of town. Ben Oakes and his wife were tlieir guests over the Oklahoma game weekend. 
News of JOE LAUERM,\N'S death arrived too late for the last issue although it was mentioned in the last ALUMNUS. 1 have sent letters of condolence with Mass cards to the families of Joe, BILL CLEARY and BOB CUNNINGHAM. FATHER BOURKE MOTSETT said the Masses and sent the following letter: 
Terence P. Brennan 

One of the nation's outstanding young coaches. Tern' Brennan, has just been added to the Notre Dame athletic staff. Under Frank Leahy's guidance. Terr)' will coach the freshman squad. Terr)' is remembered as being one of the greatest halfbacks at ND during the '40's and his 98-yard run against Army on the opening kickoff in 1947 still ranks as one of football's finest thrills. 
After receiving his A.B. degree from Notre Dame in 1949, Terr)' accepted the position of head football coach at Mt. Carmel High School in Chicago. His record included three consecutive All-Chicago titles—a record for public and parochial high school football there. Mt. Carmel has not been de­feated in the last 21 Catholic league games. Terr)' has been stud)ang law at DePaul University in his spare time and will get his LL.B. this year. He is married and the Brennans are "the proud parents of Terence Kelly Bren­nan, age seven months. 
*'Dcar Jim: 
"Thanks most kindly for the High Mass stipends 

for three of our deceased classmates. I remember 
all of them. I have said a Mass for JOE LAUER­
MAN and ' written his widow a note. One of my 
parishioners comes from ^farinctte and told me 
of his death. It was \-er>' sudden. I had met 
his lovely wife and fine children when I stopped 
at his home a number of years ago. May the 
Lord have merc>' on all three of them. Haven't' 
seen many alumni lately. I saw the Pitt' game as 
well as the Purdue game but didn't run into any 
classmates. JOHN BELTON, one of our parish­
ioners, is running a trip for our local Alumni 
Club to the Oklalioma game. We had a mar­
velous trip last year. RALPH DALTON, also 
a parishioner. Is back In civilian life and ^\'as In for coffee after Mass last Sunday. JOE MEITZ­LER has been working in Springfield for some time so I don't see him very often. Some day when my assistant will let me ofT I hope to have lunch wth you and DON 0*TOOLE and any­body else wc can catch. If the vigil light money is coming in strong I might even take the check. Thanks again, Jim, and with kindest regards, I remain. Gratefully yours, Bourke." 
Bourke sent a Christmas card and mentioned seeing the above local *3Iers again. Don O'TooIe and his family were down to sec him in Novem­ber. No mention of lunch so the lights must be low In Danville. 
I received the following note from our close friend and former Prefect of Religion we' all knew so well: "It was surely good of you to send me the report on BOB CUNNINGH.AM's last days. I had not heard anything from him or about lilm in a long time, and I am con­soled to know he had sticii a happy death. I must write to his mother and tell her I have offered the Holy Sacrifice for Bob. JACK ELDER has written also and told me about the funeral. A thousand thanks' for your own prayer­ful remembrance of me. God bless vou." JOHN 
F. O'HARA, C.S.C. 
Mrs. Lauerman wrote in December acknowledg­ing the ^^ass offered for Joe by Father Bourke Motsett: "I wish to thank you for your kind letter and the Class of '31 for the ^fass Offering. Joe always thought so much of his Notre Dame classmates. I feel I ^^*as privileged and blessed to have had Joe for a husband and ask God daily to give me the necessary* strength to carry on without him. Thank you again." Sincerely, Geraldinc Lauerman. 
Charles Cunningham, brother of Bob. sent the following note: "In behalf of my mother, Cath­erine and myself. \ve all wish to express our ap­preciation of -the many nice things you did for Robert and then the letter you wrote to the Archbishop and the Masses, Wc buried Robert last Friday at "Vienna, 111. Father O'Mcra. Pas­tor of Holy Cross Churcli, Deerfield, and Jack . Elder were there. In fact Jack Elder said Father O'Afera gave one of the finest sermons he had ever heard. Of course, wc all appreciate it very 
much. Thanks again for ever>'thing." 
For the class, I wish to extend our svmpathv 

to HENRY G. O'CONNELL upon the death of 
his wife, and to JEROME CROWLEY on the 
death of bis father. 
CLARENCE H. PUTTER, Mishawaka biLMncss­

man, was named 1953 Chairman for the March 
cf Dimes in St. Joseph County. Tlic Daily News 
reported on U. S. Attorney. JOE DEEB in con­
nection with a Michigan narcotics case. One way 
or another I manage to hear something about the 
'31ers from Grand Rapids. Certalnlv Joe. ED 
BRENNAN. JOE BOYLAN, GEORGE JACKO­
BOICE or JOHN PULTE should be able to send 
a letter soon. If I drive over to Detroit again 
soon, I'll take time to stop in Grand Rapids and 
see if you fellows arc still alive. In December I 
saw a friend of TEX BRIEGER's from Pittsburgh 
and received a fine report on him. Tex. you 
frame through with a fine letter a year ago. If 
you could find time to repeat, I would appreciate 
it. RED O'CONNELL reported having seen JOE 
GONCIARZ, who operates the Brightway Phar­
macy at 5634 Diversey Avenue in Chicago. While 
in Cr>-stal Lake recently Red visited with PHIL 
ANGSTEN who also gave a good report on JIM 
RICH and VERN KNOX. Jim recently became 
the father of a baby boy, which makes three 
far the Rich's since his return from £er\*lcc 
in 1948. 
Among those who sent Christmas cards were: FRANK HOLLAND, RAY COLLINS, BOB PEN­DERGAST, F. X- .MURPHY, JR., CLARK BENKENDORF. JIM RICH, AL STEPAN, J.ACK DEMPSEY. GIL SE.\.MAN, TOM MONAHAN. NOEL GIES. SPIKE SULLIV/\N (with a note promising a letter) and BOB KENDALL. .^poIo• gies to any I may have missed. 
ED RYAN reported seeing the following at the 

Micliigan State game: PAT CANNY, TOM PUR­
CELL, NICK BOHLING, JOE SAVOLDI and 
CHUCK ROHR. Things must be tough in Grand 
Rapids, apparently none of the bo>-s went over 
to East Lansing. 
HASKELL ASKEW sent the following note: "I 

\s*asn't a bit upset about my name not appearing 
In the column because I think you are doing a 
s^vell job as class secretary' and I get a kick 
out of hearing the news about our classmates. 
However, I am certainly distressed to hear about 
Joe Lauerman and Bob Cunningham. I had planned to come to the ' Notre Dame-Oklatioma game but some conflicting business makes it im­possible for me to attend. This Oklahoma team is really a flne - team and I know it will be a wonderful ball game. I will miss not seeing you during the game, but the first time I am in Chicago, I'll make it a point to call ymi for lunch if you can spare the time. Remember me to all the boys you see at the game." 
Present at the Notre Dame Club of Chicago Communion Breakfast were GIL SEAMAN. MAR­TIN DOWNEY, BERT MET2GER, GENE VAL­LEE, RAY DONLON and JIM DOYLE. Imagine my surprise after Mass when I saw TOM MON­AHAN and his wife. They were up for a broom corn convention and happened to pick the same Mass at St. Mary's- DON MacDONALD sent an invitation to Open House for Sunday, Decem­ber 28, but with bad roads in December I couldn't make it. 
The Courier-Journal Magazine of the Louis\-ilIc Courier-Journal ran quite an article and picture of JIM McQUAID, operator of Macs Newsstand. Vmcennes, Ind. It appeared in the December 21 issue. It told the story of his illness and how hs started with a small comer stand which has grown tremendously with the aid of his wife. Ruth. We can all take our hats off to Jim and Ruth for the fine job they arc doing in their shop. As I said before, here is one place where you will get excellent ser\'ice on your magazine subscriptions. 
BERNIE SHAF reported on NORBERT STAR (STARSHAK) now living in Elmhurst. Illinois. 
•Norbert recently received his Master's Degree in Business Administration. 
There will be another ALUMNUS deadline soon. Please get letters in promptly. I can mention '31ers from Chicago and surrounding towns, but I don't want to be accused of packing the column with local news.

A letter to Class Sec'y. JIM COLLINS from JOE McCABE, Class Sec'y. for 1933: 
"Dear Jim: 
"I liopc you won't mind if the man next door takes a small corner of yooir shop to express what I know ts a feeling shared by many of the class of 1932. 
'*I refer to tlie death of FRcVNK REILLY. 1 was Frank's roommate during our undergraduate years, and It came as a terrific shock to know that he had gone on. More de\*astating, perhaps, because his name was so often mentioned at the reunion this past June. Fellows like JIM WARD, JOHNNY PERRONE, JOHN COLLINS, ED RHATIGAN, BOB GORMAN, PAUL OTOOLE, LEO SCHIAVONE, and many others brought his name up with genuine sorrow that he wasn't there. Tlieir sorrow, like mine, was I know tinged with unbelief when they heard of his death. He was a grand fellow and wonderful companion and roommate. 
'*I feel sure that all of the class will join me in remembering Frank—or *Doc' or *Rcd' as he was also known—in our Masses, Communions and prayers, and extending our deep sympathy to his widow and family." Sincerely yours, 
Joe McCabc

Unbclic\-able, isn't it? All classes sooner or later come to read that **20'' figure, but' that first time Is a shocker. 
You know %%'hat it means. Committees, mailings, travel dates, hard work for some, fun for every­body. JIM ARMSTRONG'S new pa\-ment pack­age plan will be a great help. Just announced. Looks great. 
You who missed and you who made No. 15 re­member the complete job turned in by BOB CAHILL and his crew. Send in your suggestions now for committee people and for events you want, and I'll hold them for the chairman.

SORLN'S PORCH FATHER F.ARLEY isn't here any more to rifle out the letters, but these few were flipped in by his grey-suited substitute: JOHN P. BURNS, former ALUMNUS copy-chopper who blue-marked these notes into English for many months, writes from &t5 Bergen avenue, Jersey City, N. J.: **I split my efforts between JACK ADAMS of Union Terminal Cold Storage and the Co-ordinating Committee of the Perish­able Foods Industry—it even confuses me—of the Port of New York. **The girl-child is gt^ins lo ^ Dominican school (second grade), and we're practically at the Jour­nal Square entrance to the Hudson tubes.

FRO.M THE PRESIDEN'T Our class president, FATHER JIM MOSCOW, writes as assistant director of hospitals for the . Archdiocese of Chicago: '*It is always a pleasant event to mail in my annual dues and wish you and Mary the best. - There is only one kickback. These years roll around pretty. fast. Have voir noticed it?" (That letter went to Bob . Cahill, then here.) 
HOWDY, HO\VIE HOWARD \V'ALDRON of 938 Berkeley, Tren­ton, N. J., had a trip to Helsinki for the Olym­pics. That; should furnish material for a good yarn. He also reported some long-awaited news about a real guy—RUBE GRUNDEMAN. Operations on a ffwtball knee' slid him back to '35, but he's still one of us. Howie said that a dinner with Rube brought out the news that he's area super­visor for General Motors insurance In West Fargo, N. D., and that he's little changed. 
T. Howard ako said he sets JIM FAG.AN, Newark law\cr, and that JOE ^VALDRON, '36,. sees BILL HUISKING of Huiaking Drug occa­sionally. Charlie is now In Sarasota, Fla., per­manently.

STILL RESTLESS The wandering many of us did In '34 days a-Iookin' for living money must have left its mark, for recent lists show 43 of us changed addresses.

Recently the Board of Directors of Bethlehem Steel Company announced that Bernard D. Broeker had been elected Assistant Secretary of the com­pany. A native of Natoma, Kansas, Bemie received his A.B. degree from Notre Dame in 1930 and in 1933 his Bachelor of Laws, cum laude. from Harvard. 
From 1933 to 1940 he was asso­ciated with the law firm of Cravath, Swaine and Moore. New York City, General Counsel for Bethlehem Steel. He was admitted to the New York Bar in 1934 and later to that of the United States Circuit Court of Ap­peals. In 1940 Bemie became associated with Bethlehem Steel in the secretar­ies department. 
He is a member of the American Iron and Steel Institute, Pennsylvania Waterworks Association and the Ameri­can Law Institute.

Russ and Ruth started going together in the Dome, believe it or not, and they look about the same now as they did then. Check your copy! Fehlig ran tlie St. Louis dub's football spedal to the Okie smasheroo. and we had a great time at our annual reunion with their gang at the Knickerbocker Sunday.

NO SHADOW, HE FATHER DOREMUS was no shadow- in the Morris Inn Lobby. He's amazingly sharp on names after all these years—and he's still looking for Fran Toomey. Devilish part of these gridiron day reunions is their brevity, I just got in tune with quips by O'Toole again when time ran out. Bill fin­ished law- school this fall, the eager beaver, after trudging over Europe in GI duds. Brother Larry, another lawyer, says Bill ain't bad at it at all. ..uglish majors start sharp, look sharp, stay sharp.

Ah, in this world of higher education you learn something every day if you just keep your e>'cs open and grab for the mail. 
How many of you know that the heart of the continent is a little red spot a short mashie shot southeast of Rugby, North Dakota (State Bird: Meadowlark}? Well, it is, and I can prove it with a handsome two-page map in four colors which is the center spread of an impressive brochure called "Bountiful North Dakota.** I have puzzled over this map a good deal because it is one of those creations liberally spattered with line drawings of things carefully marked "Barley," "Baled Hay," "Historic Site" and such like. A person can curl up with a thing like that on a cold winter night, elbow deep in warm popcorn and let the rest of the world roll by. 
I came by this mine of Information In a semi­m>-sterious manner. It arrived at the office one day with a card dipped to the front. The card reads: "Bountiful North Dakota, Land of Oppor­tunity" and is signed ROBERT V. TROUSDALE, *37, Mott, North Dakota (On the Cannonball River In the southwest quarter of the state. On my map, unfortunately, a carefully drawn while-face steer has his right forefoot planted squarely in Mott.) Now I am pleased to get this book, and of course I remember Bob Trousdale, one of Dean McCarthy's boys who was once president of the band. But I am tantalized by the m>*stery of what, exactly. Bob had to do with '^Bountiful North Dakota." Did he ^vrite it? Did he draw the pictures of baled hay. Sitting Bull, General George Custer and the State Flower (Prairie Rose) ? Or has he been informed that I am burning with a desire for lore of N. Dakota? (The world's largest rolled-fill earth dam is at Garrison—and that will win you a prett>- penny on a quiz show some day.) 
Be that as it may. Bob is the one and only member of the Class of '37 who has greeted my return from exile with so much as a postcard. And believe me, nobody ever got more mileage out of one name. 
Here's how we're going to work it. Since the whole Idea of a column like this is to get names into it—names from all over the place—wc have hit on a capital device. It Is obviously ineffi­cient and time-consuming to wait for names to come to us so we will pick the names at random. In other words, this column will be replete with names of people who have not \%'ritten us, about whom Wc know absolutely nothing and of whom we have heard not the faintest rustle of ne%%'5. The only rule is this: ^Vc expect to hear, within 30 days, from at least half of the clou'ns men­tioned In this piece, othcn%*Isc they may expect stony silence from henceforth. Here are the first

15 YEAR REUNION 
JUNE 12-13-14 
Charles M. Callahan Sports Publicity Department Notre Dame, Indiana 

General Chairman DON FISHER of the 15-year reunion feels that the gathering of the '38ers oa June 12, 13 and 14, will be the most distinguished affair of its kind held here in some time. As m basis for this feeling, Fisher points out that the President of the University of Notre Dame, REV. THEODORE M. HESBURGH, C.S.C., the Mayor of South Bend, JACK SCOTT, and the retiring President of the Notre Dame Alumni Association, HARVEY FOSTER, are members of our class and will be present. 
The '38 dinner, according to Fisher, will be held in the Lounge of the Rockne Memorial. This affair, on Friday evening, June 12, will be the highlight of many activities planned for our cJass. 
With reference to the cost of the reunion, is Is the plan of Fisher and his committee to just make one charge—at the time that a returning member signs in upon arri\'al back at the campus. Upon the occasion of the 10-year reunion, a pre­liminary fee was asked in advance. Fisher feels that just making one charge is less cumbersome on everybody concerned. 
Wthin a fe^v ^vceks, cards will be mailed to class members which can be sent back indlcatlns as to whether or not the indiWdual will be able to be in attendance. Until a fairly good estimate can be obtained as to how many '38ers are re-taming, it will not be possible for the Alumni Office to assign us a hall as reunion headquar­ters. This, however, is a routine matter that will be handled in due course of time. It Is Fisher's belief that better than 150 members are planning to return. 
The South Bend Class of '38 group had another gathering on January 24, in the form of a dinner at the St. Joseph County Airport restau­rant. Wives were invited this time, so nobody had to worry about rushing home. 'With CHAR­LEY DUKE as manager of the South Bend Air­port, it was understandable that we had a fine meal and wonderful service. PROF. ED CRONIN was chairman of the affair. In attendance were: BERNIE and Mrs. BAUER, JIM and Mrs. BEAXJDWAY, CHARLEY and Mrs. BOROWSKI, ED and Mrs. HAGER, JIM and Mrs. LAHEY, JACK and Mrs. MOULDS, JOHN and Mrs. MURPHY, CHUCK and Mrs. SWEENEY, NEL­SON and Mrs. VOGEL, DON and Mrs. FISHER, LOUIS and Mrs. ANDERSON, BOB and Mrs. HOLTZ, Mrs. Duke, Mrs. Cronln, BILL GIB­BONS and yours truly and Mrs. C. From out of town, BILL COSTELLO and his wife were down from Chicago. Bill was in South Bend for a Television Exhibit taking place at the Navy Drill Hall on the campus. He is with Capehart-
IFarnsworth, in case somebody u-ants to contact 
him about buying a TV set. 
RAY MEYER brought his DePaul team to the -campus for a game on Feb. 25. Ray*s club, as well as Notre Dame, was selected to compete in the X.C.A.A. tournament because of its outstand­ing seasonal record, 
TOM JORDAN was down from Chicago to sec the DePaul game and was also present at several other games, as is understandable inasmuch as his older brother, Johnny, '35, has coached the -basketball Irish the past two years. 
JERRY SHINE, from Indianapolis, was a brief -campus visitor on Feb. 21, and saw ilic North­~\vestern game that night. 
Football as played when the '38ers %vere In sdiool was a subject of discussion the other eve­ning on South Bend's new television station, 
"\VSBT.•n^ when Sportscastcr JOE BOL.AND, the •old line coach, interviewed CHUCK SU'EENEY. Chuck, as mentioned here before, is whh Sinclair Oil in South Bend. He has been ver>- active in the local meetings of our class. 
JI^( CARSON phoned recently from Indtan­-apolis to check the dates of the home football jpmics. Jim is with the Indiana Bell telephone company and has to set up periodic trips of in­spection to this part of the state. He naturally 'wanted to be sure he would be in town for one •or two of tlie games. 
JOHN PLOUFF, for many years assistant husincss manager at Notre Dame, took over a nc^v position in Milwaukee some months back. His address in Milwaukee is 5740 North Shorcland. 
BILL M<^*.-\MAR/V, Chicago attorney, -wrote to 3sk the status of lads, like himself, who took the combination undergrad and law school courses in six years, receiving their undergrad degree at the 
•end of five years and tlic law degree in six. You are all still regarded by us as members of the class of '38 and we'll be looking for you in June. 
A card from Mrs. HAL LJ\NGTO N announc­ing the arrival of a second daughter last August. The Langtons, who live in Baltimore, now haxc Jour bo\'s and two girls. Hal is a sales repre­sentative for a sporting goods concern. 
At the Holy Cross basketball game, in Boston, saw LEN TOBIN briefly and had a more ex­tended \isit after the game with CHICK G.AL­LAGHER and his wife Mildred. Chick stated that JOE CORCORAN and DR. JIM BLUNT are both doing fine. 
At the N.C.A.A. meetings, in Washington, in early Januarx*, the Washington Notre Dame Club held a reception in honor of the present and former Notre Dame athletic greats who were in the nation's capital. AVashington Club members v,ho were present included JOHNNA' BRrVD-DOCK and DR. JIMMY CORCORAN. As for­mer infielders, both were naturallv happv lo see ND Baseball Coacli JAKE KLINE at tiic gath­ering. GEORGE HOWARD was another of the IVashingtonians at the reception. 
GENE DOLAN, who has moved out of New York City to a residence on Long Island, was a recent South Bend and Notre Dame visitor. Gene's sister and brother-in-law moved to Sou. h Bend during the past year. 
Tliat is enough for this time. However, keep in mind the dates again for our I5th reunion—­June 12, 13, 14. Make plans now to be back on the campus. It's been a long time.

Got married in '41 to Dorothy Patterson and by now have three cluldren, Juansito 10, Linda Marie 8 and xVnita Maria 3. At Bendix I was in close contact with our classmate W.ALT DRAY and also BEN FISHBURNE. At the end of M7 I decided to return to Puerto Rico for a spell of hot win­ters and have been here since. A few years ago had the pleasure of having ENRIQUE ARIAS from Cuba drop in for a visit. He \\'as on a business trip. Also saw BILL SHAKESPEARE who docs selling in Puerto Rico for his firm, tlic TImr people. I sec a lot of JOSE RAFAEL RODRIGUEZ and RALPH MARTINEZ. Have worked together with a-\RLOS LOZARO on sev­eral projects and wc keep in vcr>* close contact. Down here I am connected with the firm L. An­tonsanti. Inc., Engineers and Contractors. We are one of the largest contracting firms in Puerto Rico and right now I am completing a two million dollar waterfront and seix'age job at the city «>f Arecibo, P. R., where I have moved \vith Dorothy and the kids. 
"Whatever became of DAVE SPROFKE, KING, DARROUZET, WILLUMS, SHOEMAKER, SCHICKEL and the rest of the '40 iLE.*s? How about old perpetual student S.ABBY BONET? 
**If things go along right, we are planning on spending the coming Summer in South Bend and will tr>' to get an early start so as to be there for graduation exercises and class reunions. See you all then for a good gab session and beer party." 
A note from JIM D.-VNER states: 
**Just a note to let the class know by your next column that I am still alive and looking forward to the next class reunion.

Tlic attempt at reviving this column has de­veloped Into somewhat of a bonanza. In the last supplementary- letter I mentioned tliat about a dozen letters came In after the initial plea near the end of the year. There have been some others since. 
Now I have an idea that should produce some good reading for future columns. I'd like to hear from the wives of 1941 graduates. . No doubt they can come up with some good sketches on the men. (Incidentally, I am barring my wife, Dolores, from this phase of the 1941 column. Site's been to anxious to submit an entr>'}­
But back to the news. The last letter featured the adventures of "HUTCH" Korth and his AAXICO outfit's All-Notrc Dame debate over franchises for airlines. I did forget to mention, however, that the Korth family includes three sons and a daughter. Now for some other reports. (Tliese will In­clude every letter I've gotten. And anyone can deduce from that that I'll need more material for the next Alumnus deadline—March 15 for me, Marcli 10 for anyone who wants to send me some ne^vs, wives included). From Proridcnce, R. I., conies a note from GEORGE FERRICK. He is branch manager there for New York Life Insurance Co., went tliere a year ago from Buffalo. At the ND-Holy Cross basketball game he ran Into JOHN MON­AGHAN, the only 1941 man he's seen In Provi­dence. George would be interested in getting , together with any other *41ers in the area. (His business telephone is Gaspee 1-4115—and I'm not expecting a commission if he sells any insurance. JOE McGEE\'^R is now losing his Birming­ham, Ala., accent as a resident of Santa Bar­bara, Calif. Joe Is selling real estate and keeping the peace among two daughters and a small son. Mrs. McGccvcr, with the children's help, says Joe, is raising 50 clilnchillas. (Any coats you can't use, Joe, remember it's colder in Pittsburgh than in Santa Barbara.) Incidentally, Joe's ad­dress is 850 Estrilla Dr., Hope Rancli. One of '41*5 ND men, PHIL McCVNNA, dropped a line from Marinette, Wise Phil is doing well in the family department also, having tlircc sons and two daughters. (Wonder who the 1941 champion Is In this department?) Phil re­grets that he missed the 10th reunion. But he %^'as proud, and rightly so, to be on the campus *he. week before to sec his father get an hon­orary Doctor of Laws degree at the commence­ment. Next on the list is JLM TE/\GARDEN who wrote from Oak Harbor, Ohio. Jim Is sales manager for the J. Weller Co., canning outfit. Married for five years, Jim has a son named Tcrrance Michael. Of the other 1941 men, Jim soes HARRY GOTTRON frequently (Harry lives in nearby Fremont. Ohio) and hears occasionally from GEORGE ILVSSAS. CHARLIE BROGGER is the next correspondent on the list. He is up in ^fuskegon, Mich., with the Kaydon Engineering Corp. Charlie and his wife Jeanne (who tjped the letter for him) are the parents of four youngsters—three boys and a girl. Charlie keeps in touch with his former roommate ROY BAIRLEY who is also married and has three children. Roy Is living in Toledo, Ohio. Down in Spartanburg, S. C , JACK JOYCE is working as a life underwriter for the Penn Mutual Agcnc>'. /\s many of you know, Jack con­tracted polio back in 1948 and spent a year at Warm Springs, Ga. Formerly with Startex Mills, Jack took his present job because it gives him more physical exercise. He is using a left leg brace and francs for walking. Jack's letter is full of good spirits and his major worry (at time cf writing) was "who fell down on scouting the Pitt Panthers for the ND game?" Not me. Jack. I saw Pitt the following week against West Vir­ginia and they couldn't do a thing right. Jack, by the ^^'ay, has three children, the oldest a girl and the next two boys. JOHN ROSS, in Syracuse, reports that he mar­ried his secretarv', has two daughters and is 

working with the Veterans Administration in prr­sonael work. Occasionally he runs into DAN KELLY and has been visited by MILT PIEPUL. 
A fancy letterhead from Marquette, Mich., came from Specker's Super Scr\'icc Garage—the author JERRY FAN'EGLIO. Jcrr^* is a partner in an auto and truck business and also in a crractery and memorial business covering the entire Upper Peninsula of Michigan. His wife is the former Anna Budna, a graduate of Rosary Col­lege. They have three bo>-s. SAL ANDRLVCCHI lives within 16 miles of Marquette and Jerr>* sees him frequently. Sal is in a Afagncto Scr\*­ice business. 
Another report from California is from RAY FIDLER, partner in the Furniture Mart of Long [teach. Ray has two children. His letter is a request for news from DAN KELLY, BOB STRICKER, JIM TINNY, BOB COX and JACK BURKE. I'll be glad to act as intermediary-should any of those scoundrels want to write to Ray. Hi5 address is 250 Locust Ax'c., Long Beach 2, CaliL 
From Flint. Mich., comes a note from one of the six KELLY Karactcrs who graduated in 1941—the one and only Ray. Ray married Kay —Kay Lc Vassiier, that is, from St- Mar>''s. They have five *'fat and sassy" youngsters who keep the parents slender by leading them a merr>* chase. {Ray, slender?) To give this tribe plenty of room Ray bought a fraternity house. Guess he figured, being an ND man. that's as close as he'd ever get to joining one. Since the lOlli reunion, which he attended, Ray has run into BOB LANGLOIS, PAUL SCHIAPPAGVSSE and BOB SWEENEY, Langlois is with Nfcnasha Wooden Ware Co., Sweeney is selling Dodges— and Ray, incidentally, is with Goodbody & Co., selling securities. 
I'll wrap this column up with a report on the doings of TOM GALLAGHER of left tackle fame. Tom points out that he roomed %viih VALEN­TINE BLATZ, HI, and lived in the same hall with JOHN FOX, a relative of the Miller fam­ily. So what's Tom doing?—selling Budwelser. Tom has two boys and two girls. And he's living in Chicago—at 7639 Calumet Avenue. 
Thanks to all of the foregoing guys for the letters. Keep them coming and I'll keep putting them in these columns. I'll tr%- to answer as many as possible personally. But, if I don't, you can be sure that they'll be mentioned in the column. 
Tlie way I figure it, there arc nearly 600 of you I haven't heard from yet. Letters from all of you and we can take over that Alumnus. (Ed. Note: We're all for it. J.C.)

Also, in the mails came a letter from a crony tainly like to hear from all of us. of Callahan and me wiien we lived in Dillon Hall. The writer was DICK MILLER (Dr.. no less) who wrote from 302 Waterloo Bank Bldg.. Waterloo, Iowa: "I received the Alumni list and noted—egad—that you had mc listed without the accoutrement of the 10.000 years training I've had—namely. "M.D.", a "Dr." after all the iilood. sweat, and tears—no "Dr."—what will my old pal, JACK BENNETT, think—that I've flunked out, eh? Also, what is that os. '39-'42? (Ed.

"I've been in practice for 5 whole weeks now and things aren't exactly riLslung.** (Seo'. Note: Now he tells me he is an OB and Gynecologist).­
Our next letter came from LIEUT. STEPHEN

"I was recalled by the Na\y just a year ago. Am once again a destroyer gunnery officer, but hope to get promoted and get on the beach. Had a pleasant talk with JOE HILDEBRAND at the Norfolk Officers* Club last month. Joe gets out shortly—is LCdr now. 
"I also had a letter from DON MILLER who has launched his legal career in Burlingame, California. I hope to share that wonderful area with him when I get out. JIM McELROY and I correspond, although as yet I haven't been able to get down to Norwalk, Conn., and sec him and his family. 
"Incidentally. JOE HILDEBRAND says that BOB TIMMERMAN is going great guns process­ing food in Ohio." 
The zero hour for the big reunion week-end is approaching, so draw your plans now to attend the week-end of June 12, 13, 14. Check in on campus to see the new buildings, see the old fzces among new surroundings. Check the Stadium lo sec if Dan Shannon jarred loose any bricks and mortar when he hit Oklahoma's Larr>' Grigg last fall. And don't forget to bring along your Max Adler '*Browsing Card"—maybe they'll punch i£ while you're en route to the Oliver for a legit beer. Soon we'll send you dope on just where the various functions such as the buflTets and beer benders will be staged on campus Friday and Saturday nights. 
Don't Forget now. Make that reunion. In case j-ou have forgotten the dates (since the last paragraph) the BIG days are JUNE 12, JUNE 13, JUNE 14. See you there! 
A letter from JAY GIBSON, 1940 Judah Street, San Francisco, California, reads thusly: 
''Recently received the class newsletter and wanted to let you know about our change of address. 
"First, though, John, I do want to tell you how much I appreciate the work you have been doing as class secretar>*—the news of the clxss has alwa>'s been so welcome and Interesting that I'm sure many of us tend to forget what a real job it is to be responsible for getting it out. (Editor's note: I heartily concur wit h Jay Gib­son's remarks about the class secretary; Jack \Viggins does a terrific job and his ^vork hxs cer­tainly been an important factor in helping us to put the ALUMNUS magazine together.

The central office reports receiving several "ex­pressions of shock". from Alumni who have the inisimpression that less, rather than MORE ND news now reaches us each year as a result of the new system. Briefly. It was concluded some months ago that the Alumni would enjoy receiv­ing, in addition to the ALUMNUS, the magazine. NOTRE DAME. To maintain a balanced budget and keep within printing costs, but at the same time to assure each alumnus the maximum of news about his Alma Mater and classmates, it was decided to publish and send to each ND grad four, instead of six, issues of the ALUM­NUS each year; four issues of NOTRE DAME (v.hich formerly went to non-alumni and students' parents); and two short form alumni news bulle­tins (one of which you have received recently). It all adds up to a sincere effort on the part of your .•Mumni Association to keep you as well in­formed as possible. Of cmirsc, the lifeblood of 
. this particular column depends on your individual cfTorts. It would certainly be appreciated by your sccretar\- if you'd take a minute or two TODAY to brief lis on what you're doing, whom you've seen or heard from, how big jr. is getting, etc. 
Enough verbosity, you say. OK, into the news. But first a word of thanks for your Christmas cards and greetings. Hope you all had an en­joyable holiday and that the New Year has already had many bright moments for you and vours. 
CAMPUS REVISITED LiKiking over the past year, one of your >ecrplar\**s most pleasant recollections is renirnin.i; to ND for the Oklahoma football weekend. Thrilled to many great games during undergrad and law, school days, but this one really was a heart-stopper, as you well know. Getting ahead of the story, though. .Actually, arrived in Chicago on Thursday and staged a reunion with Hx\RRY YE.ATES, who is obviously prospering quite well with the Reuben H. Donnelley Corp. advertising firm. Wc rehashed undergrad days, especially our hectic freshman year in Zahm. Each sentence seemed to start with. "Remember the time. . .". and was a preview of what we can expect on a mammoth scale when all the gang gets together next year for our 10-year reunion. Suggestion; 
start planning nou- so you^lI be on tap a year from this June for an unforgettable highlight in your life. 
On Friday caught an early train from LaSallc St. station for XD. As I climbed aboard I asked the conductor if this was the car for South Bend. At that, the gentleman just in front of mc whirled around—JOE VAN DYKE! Wc quickly settled down to a gab session that was uninter­rupted until I detrained at So. Bend. Joe was on his way to Elkhart on business and planned to be at the game Sat. with the missus. He has t%vo lirtle ones at home and is still living in Kansas Cit>' where he operates under the trade style of Home Rug Cleaning. AVith Joe as informant, I jotted the following info on the back of my Chicago hotel receipt which was the most acces­sible memo paper I could find jammed in my top­coat pocket: BOB METZLER, proud father of two and expecting a third (his wife, that is), is doing ver\' well in the insurance business In part­nership with his brother; BERNIE FINUCANE (Joe's roomie in Morrissey) associated \vith Haxxr-
Glovcr Labs (veterinarian supplies); SAM WING in the Venetian blind business in Dallas; JIM MEAGHER working out of Louis\-ilIe with Strat­ton & Terstcgc hardware supplies. 
Friday of the Oklahoma weekend was an excit­ing day on campus. It u'as homecoming and the undcrgrads were working feverishly, erecting elab­orate and clever decorations. I was reminded of that cxtravaganKi adorning Morrissey in our sophomore year, something about "On Land . . . In the Air . . . On the Scats." Remember? Still ringing in my ears is the musical background to that display of ours! 
TIic band, with cheerleaders torchlighting the way, still parades around the campus before the pep rally, blaring out *'The March Is On" and gathering the faithful cnroutc to the Field House. Tlicrc were the usual songs, cheers, speeches and heckling reminiscent of the pep sessions of which wc were a nois>* part. A **new face" Is Father Brocstl whose rally talks I am told have really captured the throng. He was in rare form the night I attended. 
I was the weekend guest of JIM MURPHY and his lovely %vifc. Barbara. Tlic>- Hvc in South Bend now and Jim Is Director of Public Informa­tion at ND. succeeding RAY DONOVAN. All weekend familiar faces appeared. Had a pleasant chat with JIM ARMSTRONG, Alumni Sccrciar>% and naturally «sitcd the DAN PEDTKE's where glee clubbers of past years congregated for serenad­ing and reunioning. Had an enjo\-ablc \isit with FRANK O'MALLEY and wc were joined in con­versation by DA\ ^ RONEY who was in from Detroit and JIM CLARKE who is with the ad­vertising dept. of Ball Band over in ^{isllawaka. In the course of my travels encountered JOE GALLAGHER (N. Y. lawyer). HERB CLARK, VINCE DUNCAN, and TOM O'REILLY in from Fort Wayne where he is associated with his father and brother, Bob, in the O'Reilly Office Supply Co. Tom rfporicd that class prexy DICK DOERMER has formed a partnership with two other Fort Wayne lauyers. It was certainly a memorable weekend—a prelude to the BIG ONE a year from June. Will YOU he there? 
SOME CAMPUS INNOVATIONS 

No more mail delivered under the door . . . instead, mail boxes on each floor in the residence halls, replenished thrice daily .. . a mimeo­graphed list of "laundry that is ready," posted on the bulletin boards of each hall, eliminating that Icng wait in line to be told, "Sorr>" your bundle isn't ready yet!" . . - the entire meal menu for the week, posted in the dining hall, and including on \'arious days a CHOICE of entree . . . the Bookstore, modernized with Improved lighting, new counters and a more spacious arrangement (Brother Conan still in charge) . . . Badin Bog surfaced and no longer a bog . -. . new residence and academic buildings sprouting . . . the Morris Inn, interior of whicli is something to behold! But despite the aforementioned, a visit to the grotto con\inces that it's still the same old ND we all cherish, truly our second home, and so good to be back!

He informs us that the 1952 "Directory of the Univ. of ND of Chicago and Suburbs'* coinci­dentally lists 44 names from tlic Class of '44. It would be most appreciated if some of those 44 fill your correspondent in with some neu-s for the next column; ditto for '44ers, no matter where located!

SIMPLE ARITHMETIC As a further explanation on the present ALUM­NUS magazine scliedule, the following is repeated. \Ve have always received six copies of the ALUM­NUS per year. Tlirough the urglngs of many, and for the good of all, the NOTRE DAME magazine was put on the mailing list of all ND alumni. In order to get four copies of this latter maga­zine per year, the ALUMNUS was cut down to four regular-size copies per year, and two short copies. Included wLh the short copies arc to be mimeographed letters from the class secretary to the members of his class. In short, the simple aritlimetic of it Is that we have gained In printed matter and scope. The plan is worthy of at least a full trial of a year or so. Hope It meets with the appro\>aI of the class—but if it does not, please be sure to let mc know so that we can 
help influence the "home office" on changes of policy'. THE LONG, HARD PULL 
We're still fighting tooth and hammer to collect $1 dues from each member of the class. So far A'c haven't spent anything of what has come in. Ho^vcver, the question arises as to how much we should be willing to spend of the general funds in order to bring another dollar In. It costs money to keep after you, to send reminders, to print circulars. Wc would rather not have to 

• spend any money foolishly—but it's really up to y-ou. Eacli of you can do your part by helping out \'oluntarily, before wc start policing the class list for the lazy. And don't think wc w*on't get !<• you!! Not all of you require such special reminders. Some arc as helpful and cooperative as can be; a real pleasure to work with. Our thanks go to those who have already contributed. Tlic prompt­ness with whicli the following men sent In their dues Is their vote of confidence In our work. Thanks to the following men for their dues: 
ARTHUR L. ANDERSON, RAYMOND F. BADDOUR, MATTHEW J. BAJOREK. THOM­AS P. BERGIN, .MICHAEL A. BISESI, JOHN C. BRESNAHAN, DAVID C. CARTWRIGHT, MI­CHAEL J. COFFEY, FRANK T. DELANEY, JR., GEORGE J.

A DOLLAR WITH A SMILE Tlie following notes were received by RAY BADDOUR with the dollar dues which some have sent in: From (Miss) Nanc>- Coffey: Enclosed Is a check for 51 for my brother's dues in the class of *45. He is still stationed with the Army in Germany, and expects to be home by March. (Nancy's brother Is MIKE COFFEY—thanks a lot, Nancy-And thank Mike for us, too.) From CHUCK ELDERKIN: "I have lost con­tact with most of the fellows from Notre Dame as I have been going to school five nights a week for the past four years. Wc have two children as of the latest count, a girl of 5 who was born while I was still at Notre Dame, and a boy bom last year." From JlKl PARIS: "Ever since I first saw Al's report in a recent issue of" the ALUMNUS that class dues had been assessed, and that you were to be the custodian of the fund, I've wanted to drop you a note along with the check. "We used to live down the hall from each other In Dillon Hall during the period of wartime ser\'-Icc known as the V-12. I know that that's when It w*as as that was the only time I lived on campus, being a South Bend citizen. None of the places I have been to compare with California, .vc I am finally going to settle down. I'm bu>-ing a home out here in the San Fernando Valley, and will move In In the Spring. I'm presently employed as an engineer by Lockheed Aircraft Corp. here In Burbank." From JOHN HORRIGAN: "Please axciise this short note—it's just to include my $1 dues. I hope you are well and that you and AI have c*.*cr>*thing under control." From THOMAS BERGIN: "Enclosed Is my *buck* to back up the efforts for our ten-year reunion. Hope you do not find the task too troublesome and further, that you get good cooperation." From HANK PAYNE: ".My clieck for one dol­lar Is enclosed, and I consider this a small sum for a large cause. I don't care if I have to hitch-hike to the gathering In '55. If that's what it takes, I'll do it. I certainly want to be on hand." From HANK FRAILEY: "Enclosed is $1 in compliance with request of one AL LESMEZ. Just • now I'm chief engineer with the Westing­house Electric Corporation, Cathode Ray Tube Department. In short, wc make TV picture tubes—thousands per month!! "Wc have three jirls and a fourth on the way. We hope it \vill be a boy. Haven't seen any of the old Ch.E. gang for years."

all, my picture tube just wont bad. Srcoiidly, that 5mind5 like a wonderful family. Congratula­tions on the children!!—Best regards, Al.) 
From JIM RETTER: *'Jiist Bntshed reading the latest ALUMXUS and note that you want class dues so I am enclosing my dollar. Please mark mc paid so that AI Lcsmez won't be writing mc n.TSiy letters. 
"I am still with Carbide, and I cover most of Ohio from the Cleveland office. I have a won­derful wife and a fine son. Sec you at the reunion." (Dear Jim, I had a nasty* letter all ready for you when I got word from Ray that you had paid up. so very* imhappily I had to destroy it. Thanks for the coopcraion, and best regards—Al.)

Saw several classmates at the Oklahoma game including GEORGE BARISCELLO, BOB LaMENSE. JACK NfcAULIFFE, '39, accompanied my wife, Jean, and me to South Bend. Best regards to all." 
From JIM RETTER: "Just a note to let you know I am still in Cleveland and that I sent my dues to R/\Y BADDOUR. I am certainly looking forward to our 10-year reunion. I ran into BYRON MARTIN, Ch.E. from our class, who was attending the A.I.Ch.E. Convention in Cleveland on Tuesday of the past week. He looked fine, is working for Corn Products Com­pany in Chicago, is married, and recently bought a house. I told him to be sure to make the 
From FATHER T. IRVING, C.S.C.: "May the New Year be filled with God's good things. We arc moving along with a full house. Tlie new Science Hall is in use. The Fine Arts will be ready in the FaU. It will take until the Fall to complete the Power Plant. So far the Indiana winter has been mild, and in about six weeks we will be looking for robins." 
From LARRY ROMAGOSA: "Enclosed please find §1 dues that you ask in your circular letter. I am sorry that I did not send that money be­fore, but I had lost your address and had to uTitc James Armstrong for it. Let mc know If you need any additional money to finance the good work you are doing as Class Secretary*. 
The 14th of October we had a new arri\"al to the family and wc are calling him Junior. No doubt, he will be a Notre Dame man. 
"I received many Christmas Cards from mem­bers of our • class' and makes me very happy to sec that they still remember mc." (Larry's ad­dress is Estcban Duran Amat, S. A., Avcntda Central No. 134, Panama, Repiiblica de Panama. Congratulations on the baby, Larrj-. Best re­gards.—Al.) 
From FR.\NC1S J. GUSHING, '29: While read­ing the December Issue of the Alumnus through quite minutely (a second time) I saw your plea in "Wanted: Vincc Cushing.'* My "baby" brother Is now the proud father of two little girls and two little boys. 
"He, and liIs beautiful and young wife, Marie, and their quartette reside at 1971 Bosworth Lane, Northfield (a suburb of Chicago located on the Skokle Route of the North Shore Electric), Illi­nois. Vincc owns his own home out there, and is getting his Doctor's Degree at Armour Tech while employed there in the Science Department. 
"All 5 of us brothers, our late dad, and two brothers-in-law are all out of ND classes: 1906, 
•29, '31, '35, '39, and '45. One of us has a son there now who is a Senior. (Thanks ex­tremely, FR/\NCIS, for your information. Vincc called mc when he visited New York on business a couple of months' ago and I was glad to take him out of the "Unclaimed" list. I hope you will feel well enough to make your 25th reunion in 1954. God bless you, and thank you again. -Al.) 
From MRS. ROBERT W. SNEE: "After tlircc and a half years of being married to my husband, BOB SNEE, '45, I am resigned to the fact that secretarial duties go hand in hand with wifely ones. Since you solicit news I'll bring you up to dale on the Snces' of South Bend. Bob Is a Section Manager at the J. C. Penny Co. and will reach the five-year mark In June. Our pres­ent family includes Julie, age 2, and Dick, age 5 months. 

"Probably like many other ND wives, I scan the '45 Alumni column as soon as the ALU.MNUS arrives. It's always fun to find a familiar name listed there. I hope we'll be seeing more in the year to come.*" (Thanks a lot Barbara for your newsy letter. Perhaps yours will start a trend. Most of us arc too busy with work problems to v.rite as often as wc should like—but, the wives who have the leisure and the time, should help their hubbies and write in!! If I honestly thought 1 could convince the wives of this, I'd set up a separate '*Lettcrs From Wives" Department in this column. But, I think the wives arc as la/y writers as the men. Amen!!!!)

Speaking of the FBI, Mr. Hoover's agents may soon have to be called in to solve the mystery of the missing statue of Father Sorin.

Not too long ago the Sorin statue disappeared only to be found holding a fishing pole in a row boat In the middle of the lake.

"Recently JIM FRICK and I sent out a letter 
to all the members of the Class of '51 who were 
up to that time tardy ^%'itll their 1952 alumni 
contribution. Tliouglit that a reminder uould 
help the classmates to get it in before the year 
was out. The number of classmates participating 
in the 1952 Alumni Fund and the Father Cav­
anaugh Testimonial (whidi ran concurrently) 
jumped from about 30 per cent to 50 per cent!! 
Although the letter was not an ofHcial University 
project, and was done in our spare time, I can 
certainly relay the thanks of the University to each 
member of our class for his wonderful support. 
"Not only did we get terrific response by way 
of contributions, but also in the way of informa­
tion about the classmates. Some of the guys an­
swering have been unheard of for a long time 
now, and all the letters were very interesting. So 
I'm going to copy parts from all those I re­
ceived and see if I can't use a Httlc influence 
down in Alumni OfHcc to get them all in this 
issue." 
From BOB BUTLER, Box 37, Durango, Colo.:

"I left Berkeley, the University of California,

From CPL. TO.M BECKM/VN, Hq. Sq. Air FMF Lant, Naval Base, Norfolk, Virginia: 
"To bring you up to date I would have to go back pretty far, so for brevity's sake let's start with Cherr>- Point. After being at that garden spot for two or three months FRANK BEITER joined me. About 10 days before we left for Norfolk we met GEORGE CHOPP and ED MIGLEY. Also, the doctor who took care of a bad knee I had was Dr. Pachner, class of about 1943. 
"After about two weeks here I got a call from BOB FISHER. He was up here working on tlic Scars' audit and one of my letters caught up with him before he left Chicago. Although we could only manage one night to shoot the breeze, I guess I was lucky that I saw him at all.

From HER.MAN KRUGGEL, JR., 1406 E, Sonn St., South Bend, Indiana:

I am auditing the operations of the American Safety Razor Corporation which has the contract to operate the Kingsbury' Ordnance Plant of LaPorte, Indiana. The good part about all of this is that it is only thirty miles from my home in South Bend. 
From LT.j.g. JAMES S. DOYLE, Com. 7th Fleet, StafT, c/o F.P.O. San Francisco: 
"A little bit about my status: I'm ser\*ing on the StafT as a communications watch officer. Like the duty very much, and the sliips I've been on are really beautiful (USS Iowa and the Missouri). Vice-Admiral Clark commands about all the ships over here so we have quite a sizeable communica­tions set-up — five or six officers on watch all ths time to Iiandle incoming and outgoing coded messages. 
"So far I've been to Pusan twice, up and down both coasts of Korea (from Inchon all the way 
around to Chongjin), and also have seen quite a

long range!

From ENS. JOHN BRODERICK, United States Na\-y Purchasing Office, 180 New Montgomery Street, San Francisco, Calif.: 
"From my address you can see that I am now on the beloved \Vcst Coast and am enjoying myself no end. I finally arrived here on Nov. 19 after finishing the course at Bayonne. This office has eleven officers, two of them Commanders, sL\ Lt. Commanders, two Lt. j.g.'s and your little friend the Ensign.

From BILL WHITESIDE, Gcrmantown Pike, Lafayette Hill, Pa.:

''I've been ser\"ing aboard thb mighty flat-top ever since the seemingly long ago days of gradua­tion from Notre Dame and the NROTC. Have made two cruises to the Japan-Korea area, the latest one being from December of '51 until last June. Now we're operating out of San Diego qualifying Na\y and Marine pilots In carrier landing techniques and anti-submarine warfare. Except to head back to the Far East shortly after the first of the year, but it should be a short cruise for me since my release date is next June. 
"Have a pretty good deal aboard the Bairoko. Spent the better part of a year as signal officer and communications watch officer, and am pres­ently holding down the job of a gunnery divi­sion officer and doubling as PIO.
