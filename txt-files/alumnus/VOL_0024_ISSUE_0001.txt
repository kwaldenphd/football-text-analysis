LDTHER AND UBEHTY 
This year, 1946, marks the anniver­

sary of the death of Martin Luther. 
There will be much written about him 
in celebration and 
he ^\•ill be hailed, 
no doubt, as the 
champion of modern 
liberty. 
His rebellion against Rome made him, his admirers claim, the founder of liberty, religious and political. 
Father Lyndi TT-i • i j 
Historical record 

proves the contrary. In 1525 the common 
people rose up against the oppression 
of their ruling princes. In that Peasants 
War, Luther lined up with the princes 
and counseled them to "slaughter the 
peasants, like dogs." 
Later he proclaimed the supremacy 

of princes even in matters of religion. 
The princes, previously supreme over 
their subjects' bodies, now became mas­
ters of their souls. 
Founder of liberty, religious and po­litical?' Founder in truth of the Divine Eight of rulers and the state, of totali­tarianism! 
FREEDOM OF THOUGHT 

A lawyer, influenced by the life of a Notre Dame grad, was taking instruc­tions to become a Catholic not so long ago. 
He studied hai-d, asked many ques­tions, and was impressed by the beauty of doctrine but most of all by the foun­dation of reason underlying Faith. 
Everything went smoothly—until we came to the infallibility of the Pope. Imbued 'vvith private interpretation of the Bible and so-called "fi-eedom of thought", he said he couldn't possibly understand or accept such infallibility. 
AVe continued the instructions on other topics thinking that time and considera­tion would produce understanding. 
One evening he came late for his in­struction, explaining that he had to arg^ue an appeal before an appellate court in another city. 
He was afraid he would lose the ap­peal too, the judges, some of them at least, apparently favoring his oppon­ent's interpretation of a statute. 
To Jim, any difference of interpreta­tion was ridiculous. The statute, a zon­ing ordinance, was a model of clarity and compi-ehensiveness, covering every conceivable situation and aimed especial­ly to eliminate conflicting interpretations and law-suits. 
Yet, two years after its adoption, a group of la^\'yers contended for three difltei'eiit interpretations of just one short clause. 
Jim was rather disgusted with the law. 
"BRAKE" OH "BREAK"? 

With a prayer to the Holy Ghost, we waded in. 
"Jim," we asked, "you'll agree that courts are necessary to solve conflicting interpretations, no matter how clear the law apparently is." "Oh sure, absolute­ly necessary," Jim assented. 
"Well," we went on, "if we mere human beings see such necessity and if the founders of this country had enough intelligence to set up a Supreme Court to interpret and apply the Constitution down through the decades to new situa­tions and changed conditions, aren't you going to credit Christ—who was God, you admit—^^vith sufficient intelligence to create a court or institution that would interpret and apply His precious doc­trine down through the ages? Call the Pope the Supreme Court if you wish. The purpose of each is the same." 
Came the dawn — and Jim's, "Say, that's common sense. Why didn't I see that before?" 
Jim's main objection to Catholicism was solved by the utter reasonableness of papal infallibility based on his own legal profession. 
To have an accurate map guiding us to any destination isn't a brake but a break. 
CHURCH CONVERSIONS AND LEAKAGE 
We hear often these days encourag­ing reports of many conversions to Ca­tholicism. Every year we see the impres­sive figures published of total conver­sions. Every time any church census is released by the U. S. Bureau of Census, the Catholic Church leads this list for total number of members and for annual increases. We hear returned soldiers re­port many conversions in the services. 
The Notre Dame Alumnus 
We hear these increases reported so frequently that we tend to think, "All's well with Christ's Church. It's growing by leaps and bounds." 

There's another side seldom reported which discourages and deflates. 
It's the story of the leakage from the church and it's tremendous. 
Many parishes are making laborious house to house surveys. The results are depressing. 
An article in The Priest (December, 1945) discloses the situation in a mid­west city of about 35,000 which has a higher proportion of Catholics than the usual 20%. 
The total number of families. Catho­lic, Protestant and Jewish, reached 9,424. Of these, 3,778 families or about 36% should be Catholic. 
Valid marriages among these Catho-' lies number 2,646—in which both hus­band and wife are Catholic—and 354 mixed marriages. 
So far, so good, but now begins the bad news. 
There are 445 invalid marriages—in which both spouses are Catholic—plus 333 invalid marriages in which one of the parties is a Catholic. 
Thus there are 3,000 valid marriages but 778 invalid ones, or a ratio of better than one invalid to four valid. 
Consider also this, for gross negli­gence and lack of faith: 277 children of families supposed to be Catholic are still unbaptized and 518 persons did not make their Easter Duty that year. 
The number who never a ;tend Mass is 790, divided among the 436 men and 354 women. The additional number who at-• tend Mass irregularly amounts to 546, a grand total of those who do not attend Mass regularly of 1,336 out of 9,656 about one out of seven. 
The writer states that the city seems to be typical for results in other cities of the diocese were quite similar. 
The conversion lists may be large but so is the leakage 
Christ and Our Lady look to us to bring these wayward ones back to the fold by our prayers and example. 
Christ once said "There is more joy in heaven over one sinner doing penance than over 99 just." 
STOP, LOOK—AND PRAY 
Each time that I pass by a church 
I stop to make a visit. 
So that when I am carried in 
Our Lord won't say—"Who is it?"

Notre Dame is Still Poor 
(An Editorial) 

Because in this issue of the ALUMNUS there is material of a nature to further mislead persons ah-eady misled re­garding the financial picture of the University of Notre Dame, the ALUMNUS feels obligated to call attention to a number of pertinent modifications. 
In the first Dome, in 1906, the following note appeared: "A duty of loyalty incum.bent on every student and alumnus is to dissipate the curious supei'stition that our Alma Mater is wealthy enough to develop unassisted." 
The Alumni Association took that admonition seriously, and from 1908 to 1922 devoted successful efforts to raising funds for a residence hall. 
It was, however, some 15 years after that first Dome that the University itself admitted need for outside aid and open­ly launched its first endowment and building fund efforts. Upon successful completion of that helpful but very in­adequate creation of a million-dollar endowment, and a simi­lar amount for buildings, recourse to outside aid was again allowed to lapse, so that in 1942 the Centennial found in 100 years of progress only one campaign for endowment on the Notre Dame records. 
About this independence, and about the physical ex­pansion of the campus which other factors permitted, there naturally grew up a myth of wealth. 
The Office of the Comptroller of the University reveals that the total permanent and unrestricted endowment of the University of Notre Dame is still just slightly over (by §10,300.) that one million dollars raised in 1922, 
The same source reveals that total endowment, in the last 5 years, has increased to just under $5,000,000. This is indeed a step ahead. But the very fact of the restricted nature of the bulk of this limited endowment only emphasizes the need for immediate addition of both restricted and un­restricted endowments. And a compai'ison of the total en­dowment with figures from other colleges and universities reveals the meagerness of Notre Dame's resources in aca­demic competition. 
Factors which permitted progress in years past have been diminishing in inverse ratio to growth of the University, Unremunerated services of the religious have suffered from the necessary increase in lay personnel. Costs of housing and feeding students have increased out of proportion to the reflected charges for those services. 
Expanded teaching staffs and classi-oom, laboratory and library facilities have increased in excess of corresponding tuition advances. 
-Athletic revenues, consistently helpful and substantial, have nevertheless dropped in ratio, to increasing operating costs of the University. 
Returns from the limited endowment funds, despite admir­able management by the -Associate Board of Lay Trustees, have decreased as elsewhere under the limitation of safe investment. 
The above are the urgent immediate problems of pre­serving a status already achieved. 
It is obvious how much the support of the alumni, through the Centennial and subsequent Annual Alumni Funds, has meant to the sustaining of the University's program in the face of these handicaps. 
But now, with an era of unprecedented opportunity ahead, there is need for the mobilization of every available source-of support. 
The University has proved its merits, in the progress of peace and iii the pressure of war. 
Notre Dame has become a definite asset to every Notre Dame man. The University has demonstrated that it is an asset to America. 
Moi-e than 100 years have demonstrated that few in­vestments of man in America have paid richer dividends in the enrichment of society in all its channels. 
We must continue to encourage investment in this enter­prise. 
From here on, development must come largely from ad­ditional support. Progress beyond the present plane will depend up an expansion of interest. 
This means that every student must be educated to the profits he receives from his investment. Every alumnus must be conscious of the increased values he enjoys from his background. 
Every faculty member and administrator must empha­size the opportunities that proper resources will permit the University to enjoy. 
-A.nd every member of this integral family of Notre Dame must be a missionary in ever widening circles of con­tact to encourage the investment by others in a University which has brought to JVmerica benefits as far reaching as any outpost of this country in which Notre Dame has so far flourished. 
In every way, we are proud of the present status of Notre Dame, But in many ways, the University has only begun to grow. Without any sacrifice of independence or initiative, in the period ahead Notre Dame must look to wider participation in the implementing of progress. 
Prewar Notre Dame Returns 
But University Is Overwhelmed by Applications from Veterans. 
The postwar Notre Dame—what is it like? 
The quick answer is that it is rapidly becoming very much like the prewar Notre Dame. 
True, out of a total registration of 2,855, thei-e were 808 uniformed students still on the campus in the current semes­ter, in the NROTC mostly, with a few in V-12 and V-5; and it appeai-s that, with the continuation of the NROTC program to July 1, there will be several hundred naval trainees here in the sem­ester starting March 11. 

But the "tone" of the campus is once again predominantly civilian, and the prewar civilian extra-curricular activi­ties are reappearing. The Sophomore Co­tillion, for instance, a casualty of the war days, is to be held on Feb. 8. The Notre Dame Council, Knights of Colum­bus, is once again active, with Commun­ion-breakfasts, initiations and regular meetings. The geographical student clubs are being reformed, and student dances (as in Chicago) are announced for the at-home period between semes­ters, in late February and early March. The Veterans' Club, a new organization of course, is a leader in student activity. 
Debating, traditionally one of Notre Dame's most important extra-curricular activities, is once again under way. In­terhall sports are completely organized and attracting lai-ge numbers of partici­pants. Students are talking in terms of a Dome in 1947 (the Dome was tempo­rarily discontinued after a special edi­tion in December, 1942, following the regular edition in May, 1942), and there is talk of reviving Scrip, like the Dome, a wartime casualty. 
With the influx of civilian studentS; the Scholastic, which managed despite severe operational difficulties, to main­tain itself through the war, is showing new vigor. 
Naval students now occupy only three of 12 residence halls—Howard, Morris­sey and Lyons—and with the start of the new semester on March 11, one of these three, Lyons, will be turned over to civilians. (Elsewhere in this issue you will read that a new residenc3 hall, to make up in part for the "decommission­ing" of Brownson and Carroll, is being 
built on the east side of the campus, just north of Breen-Phillips. It will house 200 students in the semester start­ing next September). 
And so it goes. The campus is once again much like it was in the pre-1941 days. 

Yet, of course, while there is postwar normalcy there are of course special postwar difficulties also. And the great­est of these, at Notre Dame as at most major colleges throughout the country, is this: how to accommodate the greatest possible number of returning veterans. Father Louis Thornton, C.S.C, new reg­istrar, and his staff and Father John J. Lane, C.S.C, director, Office of Veterans Affairs, and his staff are literally over­whelmed by the numbers of those veter­ans who would come to Notre Dame if they could. 
The unfortunate truth is that, even with an all-out stretching of campus accommodations and with—it is hoped— the housing of several hundred veterans in South Bend homes, the University will be able to accommodate only a part of those who ai-e applying and will ap­ply for entrance. 
(Preference in admission will, of course, be given to Notre Dame students who left in good standing to join the armed fox-ces.) 
Complicating the administration of veterans' housing is the fact that many of the veterans are married and want to bring their families to the Notre Dame area. In an attempt to meet this demand, the University, through Father Lane, has for some time been ti-ying to procure temporary houses, to be moved in from foi-mer wartime industrial sites in the Middle West. These temporary struc­tures would, it is planned, be placed im­mediately east of the campus on Univer­sity property. Since comparatively few 
such houses are available, and the de­mand from them, from municipalities and schools especially, is strong indeed, there is little likelihood that the Univer­sity vnU be able to obtain more than a part of the houses needed. 
A total of 591 veterans were enrolled at Notre Dame for the present semester, more than five times as many as in the semester just previous. Every indication The Notre Dame Alumnus 
is.that the number of veterans in school will rise by several hundred in the se­mester starting March 11 and that there will be additional numbers of vets in the September semester. (As you will read elsewhere in this issue, Notre Dame is returning to the regular two 18-week semester program next September.) 
Such is the campus — the same, but something new has been added. 


FACULTY ADDITIONS 
Dr. James C. Buck, of the Department of Physics, and Dr. Paul A. Beck, of the Department of Metallurgy, are re­cent additions to the Notre Dame fac­ulty. 

Dr. Buck, a graduate of Dartmouth in 1940, did his graduate work at Massa­chusetts Institute of Technology. In the latter school he did research work in physical electronics on the applications of cathode ray tube screens and high frequency transmitting tubes. For seven months he was employed in the Westing­house laboratories in Bloomfield, N. J., where he was concerned with X-ray tube development for measurements in con­nection with the atomic bomb project. 
Dr. Beck came to Notre Dame from Cleveland, where he was supei-intendent of the metallurgy laboratory of the Cleveland Graphite Bronze Co. Now a naturalized citizen of the United States, Dr. Beck was born in Budapest, Hun­gary, and was educated in the Royal Hungarian University of Engineering as well as in the Michigan College of Mines. 

CONSTITUTION RATIFIED 

The Alumni Board, meeting at Notre Dame Jan. 19-20, announced the ratifi­cation of the new constitution of the Alumni Association (of which all alumni received full copies) by an overwhelm­ing vote of 827 to 15. A committee of Messrs. Balfe, Higgins and Bailey was appointed to prepare supplementary By-Laws. 
The Board also prepared a 1946 pro­gram for Local Clubs; sanctioned a broad travel program for Association officers to the Clubs;, analyzed the encouraging progress of the Placement program; sanctioned the June 28-29-30 General Reunion; fixed April 29 as U.N.D. Night and Dec. 8 as U.N.D. Communion Sun­day; confirmed details of the football ticket plan for alumni; planned the Fourth Annual Alumni Fund. By use of a toll-conference, decisions involved re­ceived the sanction of every member of the Board.

Notre Dame Assists in Anti-Malarid Fight 
Dr. Kenneth N. Campbell and Associates in Depart­
ment of Chemistry Carry on Significant Research for 
Several Years in War's Chief Medical Problem. 
The Department of Chemistry at Notre Dame, it can now be revealed, worked—and with high success—on the number one medical problem of World War II, the combating of malaria. 
Foremost in the anti-malaria fight at Notre Dame was Dr. Kenneth N. Camp­bell, associate professor of chemistry, who, when the work was on a volunteer basis shortly after Pearl Harbor, be­came the sixteenth professor in the coun­try in\nted to cooperate in the projecct. Assisted by a stalf of varying size, he continued his intensive efforts until the project was closed on Dec. 31, 1945. 
Four new anti-malarial drugs, devel­oped by Dr. Campbell and his group at Notre Dame, have recently been selected for clinical trial at various hospitals designated by the government. Such trial will he completed by July 1. 
From September, 1942, until March, 1944, Dr. Campbell directed another war project at Notre Dame, concerned with the production of an important chemical for Army ordnance. This project, under the auspices of the National Defense Research Committee, employed the full time services of Richai-d S. Towne, who now works for the General Aniline and Film Corp., Easton, Pa. Details re­garding it cannot as yet be revealed. 
Thus, Dr. Campbell concun-ently for a year and a half, directed two war re­search projects and at the same time carried a full teaching load. The answer, obviously, was that he sacrificed himself to spend most of his non-sleeping hours in Chemistry Hall, Notre Dame. For this he is I'eceived deserved acclaim from his country and from the University. 
When the Japanese conquests cut off most of the world's supply of quinine an urgent necessity arose to find another drug to combat malaria. This disease, afflicting as many as three hundred million people in the world each year, is especially prevalent in the Pacific Islands, India, Noith Africa and Italy. With a high priority on manpower and supplies, the work was carried on for a time on a volunteer basis by some of the counti-y's schools. Later, the com­mittee on medical research of the Office of Scientific Development took it over and drew up formal contracts with Notre Dame and other schools, placing Dr. Campbell as responsible investigator in charge at Notre Dame. The contract provided for an adequate supply of funds. 
During three years many different series of organic compounds were pre­pared throughout the nation, as the pro­gram of synthesis became modified as a result of pharmacological and patho­logical tests. Over 14,000 compounds were-tested for anti-malarial activity in the nation-wide program. 
Dr. Kenneth N. Campbell 

At first the aim was to prepare sub­stances with the chemical structure of quinine, but simpler. One of the early projects at Notre Dame, all of which were carried out in the laboratories on the third floor of the chemistry build­ing, was the production of quinine acid, an important intermediate. Such a method, once developed, was employed on a pilot plant scale to supply different laboratories. 
Although many of the simpler qui­nine-like compounds were found much more active than quinine itself, they were too impractical and expensive to prepare on the mass-production basis required for malaria treatment. 
The Notre Dame project was respon­
sible for the preparation of compounds closely related to the new SN-7618, which has recently been widely publi­cized. The formula for SN-7618, a chlor­inated organic compound, is understand­able only to the expert chemist. The drug itself is the result of cooperative effort of many laboratories, including those of 30 colleges in the United States. When used in the treatment of malaria, it is much superior to either quinine or atabrine, a synthetic discovered in Ger­many and first produced in this country in 1942. It will cure the malignant ter­tiary malaria more quickly than ata­brine or quinine. It is superior to quinine or atabrine in the treatment of relap­sing or vivax malaria, and it will not cause the yellow coloring of the skin or 
the stomach disturbances that atabrine does. None of these drugs, however, real­ly cures relapsing malaria. They merely relieve the symptoms. 
During 1945, the last year of the con­tract, the work at Notre Dame concen­trated on antimalarials of the plasmochin type. Plasmochin, another drug devel­oped by the Germans, is effective in treating relapsing malaria, but is too toxic to be used safely. Compounds re­lated to plasmochin have a remarkable anti-malarial activity, with some of them being more than 100 times as potent as quinine. While they are all toxic, re­search workers hope to find one satis­factory for use. Compounds of this class have real promise as an actual cure for relapsing malaria. Although this form of the disease is seldom fatal, it is the most widespread and the hardest to cure. 
Dr. Campbell has received many con­gratulatory letters from the various of­ficials of the Office of Scientific Research and Development. He was awarded cer­tificates signed by Dr. A. N. Richards, chairman of the Committee on Medical Research, signifying appreciation of his service to the government. 
Associated with Dr. Campbell in the anti-malaria fight at Notre Dame were his wife. Dr. Barbara Campbell, and these 11 students, most of them gradu­ate students: 
Dr. Eldred E. Young, Dr. James F. Kerwin, Dr. Clarence H. Helbing, John 
E. Reith, Armiger H. Sommers, Ray­
mond A. LaForge, Richard D. McCor­mick, James M. Constantin, Sylvester 
L. Eveslage, Fraiicis A. Cacciapaglia and John F. Christman. For the two years Dr. Kerwin and Mr. Sommers worked on the project full time. 
The results of the anti-malarial woi'k research at Notre Dame are embodied in five scientific papers which have been released for publication, and several papers are in preparation on the NDRC work. Dr., Campbell has been invited to present some of the anti-malarial work before the Symposium on Anti­malarials, to be held by the division of medical chemistry of the American Chemical Society at the Atlantic City meeting of the society in April, 1946. 
Dr. Campbell came to Notre Dame in 1936 from the University of Illinois where he had done research on synthetic vitamin D and the yellow pigment, gos­sypol, of cottonseed meal. He was earlier on the staff of Pennsylvania State Col­lege, where he conducted numerous re­searches on aliphatic hydrocarbons. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 19.32. 
N. D Has Leading Part In Biological Warfare 
The aura of mystery, which for two 

and a half years surrounded a U. S. 
Navy biological warfare project at the 
University of California, having been 
partially lifted in January, it can no^v 
be announced that some apparatus used 
in the project was a modification of the 
apparatus devised for germ-free studies 
at Notre Dame by Prof. James Arthur 
Reyniers, '30, and his associates in the 
Laboratories of Bacteriology. 
Professor Reyniers, commissioned by 

the Navy as a senior lieutenant and 
later as a lieutenant commander, car­
ried on in the capacity of a biological 
engineer during much of the war. He 
set up in the project at the University 
of California equipnsent developed at 
Notre Dame and provided techniques 
for its operation. 
Much must still remain untold about this University of California project and about the part of Notre Dame men in it. It can be revealed^ however, that as a result of the secret (hidden behind an announced project for preventing and controlling airborne infections, notably influenza) considerable knowledge has been gained in mass defense against' possible employment of a certain disease, which is highly fatal. Laboratory and field, data have been gathered which demonstrate that a man-made epidemic as an instrument of war is a likely possibility.

Administrative Appointments Made 
Father Thornton, McAulifFe, 
Mun-ay and 

Rev. Louis J. Thornton, C.S.C, '29, Edward J. Murray, '31, Robert McAu­liffe, '18, and John V. Hinkel, '29, are involved in recent appointments an­nounced at the University. 
Father Thornton succeeded Rev. 

James W. Connei-ton, C.S.C, '20, who 
had been assigned to Wilkes-Barre, Pa., 
where he is acting as administrator of 
King's College, a new school being estab­
lished by the Congregation of Holy 
Cross. 
Father Connerton will handle the or­ganization of King's College, which is being founded at the request of the church officials in the east and will offer a regular arts and letters curriculum. The former Notre Dame registrar will become the first president of the college when organization work is completed. 
Father Thornton, a native of Birming­

ham, Ala., was associated with the 
Guaranty Trust Company in New York 
City following his graduation. He began 
his studies for the priesthood in 1938 
and was ordained in June, 1944. Shortly 
afterward, he was named secretary to 
Most Rev. John F. O'Hara, C.S.C, D.D., 
now bishop of Buffalo, N. Y., and for­
merly of the military ordinariate of New 
York. He remained in this capacity until 
he was assigned to Sacred Heart Parish' 
in New Orleans last summer. 
Father Connerton, who was named Notre Dame registrar in February, 1941, is nationally known as an authority on the Gregorian chant. He was for many years director of the Moreau Choir on the campus. 
Ed Murray succeeds John P. Donnelly, '39, former director of student accounts, who was named business manager of athletics last year. Miss Ann Stroyna, of South Bend, had served as acting di­rector of student accounts since that time. Ed formerly served the University as director of student employment, from 1936 until December, 1942, when he be­came a naval officer. He was recently discharged from the service. 
Bob Mc.A.uliffe, formerly of Syracuse, 

N. Y., director of personnel at Notre Dame, was named assistant business manager of the University. Bob served at the University as instructor in the Department of Journalism from 1923­1925 and was on the staff of the former 

 Hinkel Involved. 
South Bend News-Times. He was promo­tion manager for The Ave Maria at Notre Dame for one year. In 1935 he was named assistant prefect of disci­pline, a position he held until assuming personnel duties several months ago. 
John Hinkel, foi-mer correspondent for the New York Times, on Jan. 1 became director of publicity. Colonel Hinkel, lately discharged from the Army after extensive service in Europe, succeeded 
J. Walter Kennedy, '34, who resigned to become vice-president of the Scholas­tic Sports Institute in New York City. Raymond J. Donovan, '42, continues as assistant publicity director. 
John received a master of science de­gree in journalism at Columbia Univer­sity in 1930 and continued his graduate studies at George Washington Univer­sity during 1930 and 1931. After serving as correspondent for the Washington Post in 1930 and 1931, he joined the news staff of the New York Times, a po­sition he held until obtaining a leave of absence in 1940 to enter the Anny as a military intelligence resei-ve oflicer. From 1935 to 1940 he was New York correspondent for the National Catholic Welfare Conference News Service. 
In 1938, as special correspondent for the New York Tiines, the NCWC News Service and other newspapers, John cov­ered major news events in Austria, Italy, Hungarj', Spain, France, England and other countries. He is the author of "Adolph S. Ochs," a biography of the late publisher of the New York Times and is a contributor to America, Inter­racial Review and other Catholic and military publications. 

BROTHER CANUTE DIES 
Brother Canute, C.S.C., 74 years old, died suddenly on Feb. 2 while he was attending a movie in Wash­ington Hall. His death was not dis­covered until the picture ended. 
Bom Jeremiah Lardner in Chica­go. Brother Canute joined the Holy Cross Order in I89I and spent his entire religious life at Notre Dome.

Third Annual Fund Totals $94,284.27 
The Third Annual Alumni Fund was opened on Jan. 1, 1945, and, in keeping with the decision to establish the calen­dar year for the Association's financial program, was closed on December 31, 1945. 
During this 12 months period 3,096 contributors gave $94,284.27 to the Uni­versity. 
This represented a loss of 217 con­tributors from the Second Annual Fund, and a drop of 2.9% from 31% to 28.1%. (Number of contributors decreased; number of potential contributoi-s in­creased by graduation.) However, the Second Annual Alumni Fund extended from August, 1943, to December 31,1944, which may have some bearing. Average gift for 1945 was §30.45 as against the higher $33.63 of the Second Annual Fund. 
It should be noted, however, that the Third Annual Alumni Fund has not in­cluded the gift during the year of P. C. Reilly, LL.D., '39, or the bequest an­nounced in 1945 of Martin J. Gillen, LL. D., '35. Nor does it include the gift from the Hamilton family in Racine, Wis., Robert, '34, and James, '35, of the University public relations booklet, "Your Stake In The Future." Similarly, the Alumni Fund has not credited several large gifts from other "alumni families" which appear in this issue under the report of public relations. From this approach, the returns for 1945 represent, in the shortened term of solicitation, a very much appreciated response from alumni. 
Obviously, however, the source of general concern is the low percentage of participation, Avith only one alumnus in four making any contribution to the University during the calendar year. The Fourth Annual Alumni Fund, offi­cially opened on Jan. 1, which "will close on Dec. 31, 1946, ^vill make every effort through Classes and Clubs to improve this phase of the picture. 
Allocation of previous Funds, as an­nounced by Rev. Hugh O'Donnell, C.S.C, has indicated how vital this source of revenue has been during the war years to the libraries, the laboratories, the publications and the faculty of the University—all divisions which have enhanced and preserved the academic prestige and progress of the University during a critical period. 
In the Fourth Annual Alumni Fund, all of these things will be in mind as continuing objectives, with the added incentive of the participation of alumni, through the Fourth Annual Fund, in the construction of an Adoration Chapel as the campus memorial for World War II. 
This latter project is one of universal appeal. Plans and cost are not yet available in detail, but the administra­tion hopes to make this project complete in 1946. To preserve the continuity and the identity of the Annual Alumni Fund, 
(which in all normal years of operation will be primarily for unrestricted funds to offset low general endowment and to permit maximum benefit to Notre Dame's progress), and at the same time to per­mit all alumni to participate in the War Memorial, the University and the Board of Directors agrreed on Jan. 19-20 to in­corporate the Chapel in the objectives of the Fourth Annual Fund. 
Total expenses for the Alumni As­sociation for the year 1945, including the expenses of placement, fund raising, editing and mailing the ALUMNUS and the Neics of Notre Dame, travel, records, equipment, etc., with eight em­ployes working full time and one part time, were $28,059.14. Both income and expenses of the Association for the year. were audited through Dec. 31 by Pear­son & Dwyer, Chicago. 
Contributions November I, 1945, to December 31, 1945 
As in the pre\-ious Alumni Funds, the nlumni contributions represent alumni ^ifts direct to the University, through the Alumni Association, or through the Director of Public Relations.

STATE MEETINGS AT N.D. 

With leading state officials as guests, Notre Dame became the first university to entertain a session- of the Indiana Governmental Service Conference when the state g:roup conducted meetings on Jan. 17 in the Law Building as a part of a program which also included meet­ings in South Bend. 
Sessions in the legal, tax, public health, veterans' affairs and labor de­partments were held at Notre Dame, and were attended by faculty members and students. 
The legal and tax conferences, were presided over by Attorney General James A. Emmert and Otto Wulfman, chairman of the State Tax Board. Dr. LeRoy E. Bumey, secretary of the.State Board of Health, led the public health panel. State Labor Commissioner Charles W. Kern presided at the labor session and William C. Stalnaker at the veterans' affairs conference. 
Rev. Howard Kenna, C.S.C., director of studies, was in charge of arrange­ments for the Notre Dame sessions. 
A general Beunion of Notre Dame men will take place on the University campus on June 28-29-30, 1946. 
Halls are not in customary shape for housing. (The principal reason for leaving luly and August a blank in the 1946 ac­ademic calendar is to give an opportunity for the renovation o! the residences that the intensive war-time three-semester year did not permit.) 
The Dining Hall will not be back to normal full feeding facilities! 

But in answer to the demands of alumni, especially those returning from the ser­vice, the- Alumni Board has asked the University to permit this "pot-luck" Re­union with the first post-war Commence­ment, 
Two major purposes will be served, and everytliing will be simplified toward these ends: 



1946 General Reunion June 28-29-30 
1.
 The opportunity for Notre Dame men to re-visit the campus. 

2.
 The opportunity for Notre Dame men to see each other again. 


Details of the program will follow, but there will be no effort to restore the full variety of pre-war Reunion programa, or to concentrate solely on the 5-Year Class­es. The full-scale S-Year Reunion Program will be restored in 1947. 
There will be opportunities for visits, opportunities for enjoying the spiritual hospitality of the campus, an alumni ban­quet, the Commencement itself, and per­haps a few other features that will de­velop, including, we hope now. the Uni­versity Theater production of "The Mi­kado." 
So. if you are willing to take "pot-luck" in rooms and meals, plan now to be on the campus on Friday, Saturday and Sun­day, lune 28-29-30.

TWO-SEMESTER PLAN 

The regular two-semester program of eighteen weeks each will be restored at the University commencing with the fall term next September, it was announced in January by Rev. J. Hugh O'Donnell, C.S.C, president of the University. 
The change-over from the present three-semester program of sixteen weeks each was voted at a meeting of the Uni­versity Academic Council. Notre Dame has been on an accelerated program since July, 1942, because of the Navy V-12 program at the University during the war period. This program will be discontinued in June. 
The Academic Council also voted that the next regular Summer Session at the University will be held starting in June, 1947, and continuing for eight weeks. No summer session will be held this year. 
About the same time it was announced that the Naval Reserve Officers Train­ing Corps at the University will remain in its present status until the termina­tion of the tenn beginning March 11 and lasting to late June. This continuation was made possible by the passage and signing of a public act by the 79th con­gress which requested the maintenance of the N.R.O.T.C. in its present foi-m.

NEW ZAHM BROCHURE 

Early Powerplane Fathers, by Dr, Albert F. Zahm, a brochure dealing with the contributions to aviation by three 19th century air enthusiasts, has been published by the University Press. Subtitled "Henson, Goupil, Ader," the treatise outlines the work of these three men and also discusses the claim of Gus­tave Whitehead of having been the first man to fly with petroleum power. 
As alumni well know. Dr. Zahm is one of the world's foremost authorities on aeronautics. Performing his first flight experiments in Science Hall in 1880, Dr. Zahm built a man-carrying glider in the late '80s and used it for short flights on the Notre Dame campus. During his final year at Notre Dame he organized, with Chanute, Amei-ica's first international aeronautic congress in Chi­-cago. Since 1929 he has been chief of the division of aeronautics in the Li­
brary of Congress, Washington, D. C.

ATHLETICS 
BUUETIN 
Aiter winning from Michigan State by five points in the thirteenth game, the basketball team met its first defeat at the hands of Northwestern, 56-55, in the Chi­cago Stadium. 

BASKETBALL 
Coach Elmer Ripley's star-studded 
Notre Dame basketball team, at this 
writing ranked the No. 1 collegiate quin­
tet in the nation, heads undefeated down 
the home stretch of the 21-game schedule 
but with the most formidable part of the 
program yet to be played. 
Ripley, who is serving as net coach of 
the Irish this season while on leave of 
absence from Georgetown University, pi­
loted the team to victories over Camp 
Atterbury, Chanute Field, St. Louis 
(twice), Wisconsin, Purdue (twice), De-
Paul, Great Lakes (t\\'ice), Marquette 
and Kentucky in the first 12 games of 
the campaign. 
The Irish, in addition to having one 
of the finest basketball teams ever to 
represent Notre Dame, certainly rate 
high as a crowd-pleaser. In the first 12 
games they won six by a margin of three 
points or less and in all but three tilts 
have been outscored either in the first 
or second halves by their opponents. 
Undoubtedly the most exciting game 
of the season thus far came when a 
highly-touted DePaul University five, 
coached by Ray Meyer, '38, and led by 
big George Mikan, 6'9" center, invaded 
the Notre Dame gym on Jan. 5. The Blue 
Demons jumped into an early lead and 
pulled away to a 26-15 margin at half­
time. Midway in the second period they 
had extended the advantage to 36-19, 
and it appeared that the Irish winning 
streak was about to come to an abrupt 
halt. 

Consistently, however, Notre Dame narrowed the margin during the final 10 minutes of the game until with 15 seconds to go the Demons maintained only a 42-41 lead. At this point the Irish won a jump ball and the oval finally found its way into the hands of Capt. Billy Hassett. Billy calmly looped a shot from far out on the court which sailed neatly through the nets as the gun sounded to give Notre Dame a 43-42 victory in one of the most exciting games ever played on the campus hard­wood. So exciting was it that, for the first time within the memory of the old­est native, the students mshed out on 
the floor at the end and carried Hassett 
to the dressing room on their shoulders. 
Other highlights of the first half of 
the season included a pair of two-point 
triumphs over Purdue. In the first of 
the series, played at Notre Dame on Dec. 
22, the Irish built up a 40 to 20 lead 
early in the second half and then to cop 
the decision had to stave oif a desperate 
Boilermaker rally. In the mammoth Pur­
due fieldhouse on Jan. 2, the Blue and 
Gold quintet reversed the procedure by 
spotting the Boilermakers an early 18 to 
10 lead and then snapped back into form 
to win, 50 to 48, in the final minutes of 
play. 
In two other home-and-home series, the Notre Dame five easily won the first of the series in each instance and then were forced to the limit to come home winner in the return match. The Irish trounced a rangy St. Louis University quintet, 60 to 45, on Dec. 19 at Notre Dame, but had to come from behind in the second half to defeat the Billikens, 51-48, in St. Louis on Jan. 14. 
Likewise, in the Great Lakes series, Ripley's men played their best ball of the season to trounce the Sailors, 72 to 50, at the naval training station on Jan. 11, but it was a different story when the two teams met again on Jan. 18 in Chi­cago Stadium. Great Lakes jumped into an early 28 to 13 lead, but the Irish once more staged a spectacular rally to nip the Bluejackets, 56 to 54, in the finale of the World War II series between the teams. In 10 games over five years, the teams split even every season except this one.

RETURNING COACHES 
Three Notre Dame coaches have re­tur-ned to the University after discharge from service and a new assistant foot­ball coach has been added in recent weeks. 
Edward W. (Moose) Krause, head basketball coach and assistant football coach at Notre Dame before entering the service as a lieutenant in the Marine Corps in 1944, received a discharge and recently returned to the campus. He will serve as assistant football coach and will assume his duties as head basketball coach next season. 
Joseph McArdle and John Druze, two assistant football coaches, also have re­ceived discharges from the Navy and have returned to the campus to assume their duties. 
Bemie A. Crimmins, '42, of Louisville, has been named assistant football coach. Crimmins, discharged from the Navy last fall, finished the season with the Green Bay Packers in the National Pro­fessional Football League. While at Notre Dame Bernie served as a half­back, a fullback and a gruard on the Irish eleven. During his senior year, he was named All-American guard. 

TRACK * 
Team balance in all events will fea­ture the 1945-46 indoor track team which opened its 1946 season against Western Michigan College at Notre Dame on Feb. 2. 
Nine monogram winners provide the 
nucleus for the Irish who are captained 
by Bill O'Neill, of Snoqualmie Falls, 
Wash., monogram winning hurdler from 
last year's squad. 
Coach Handy's squad should be par­ticularly strong this season in the dis­tance events where two veterans are bolstered by mainstays of the outstand­ing 1945 Notre Dame cross-country team. 
The indoor schedule follows: Feb. 2—Western Michittan at Notre Dame Millrose Games, New York City Feb. 9—Michigan Relays at East Lansing Feb. 16—Marquette, Michigan State at Notre Dame Feb. 23—^Wisconsin at Notre Dame March 2—Michigan, Michigan State and Notre Dame at Ann Arbor March 8—Central Collegiate Conference Meet at East Lansing March 16—Tentative March 23—Purdue Relays at Lafayette March 30—Chicago Relays at Chicago Stadium 


CROSS COUNTRY 
Notre Dame's cross country 'team, runner-up to Drake's powerful squad in the N.C.A.A. championship at East Lan­sing, Mich., concluded one of the most successful seasons in the history of the sport at the University with a record of only one dual meet setback. 
The Irish, coached by Elvin R. "Doc" Handy, defeated Wheaton College, Pur­due, Illinois and Ohio State, losing only to Drake. Notre Dame also won the In­diana State meet, topping Indiana and Purdue. 
Members of the Notre Dame squad in­cluded: Captain Bill Tully, Lou Tracey, Fred Jones, Leo Paradise, Ray Saboda, Jim Murphy, Jim Kelly and Bill Leonard.

FAMILY ROSARY IN A HOTEL BALLROOM 
It was at the Communion of a pontifical Mass in St. John's Cathedral, Cleveland. 
Bishop Edward P. Hoban came down the steps from the altar, carrying the ciborium and holding the host. 
At the Communion railing were Cleveland's Xotre Dame Men. But something new and inspiring had been added. Their wives and children were with them.. Here knelt a Xotre Dame man with his wife and a son who towered over both. 
There knelt another father and mother with four or five children, some so small that their chins hardly came above the Commun­ion railing. 
In spite of an epidemic of influenza, there were over two hundred present. 
Previously Bishop Hoban in his sermon stressed the value of a Xotre Dame education. He also warmly welcomed to the diocese the Holy Cross Brothers who will open Gilmour Academy next fall. A second high school to be opened as soon as possible on the west side. 
.\fter their thanksgiving, tlie families left the Cathedral and assembled for breakfast at tlie Hotel HoIIenden. 
There, at the first annual Family Com­munion Breakfast of the Xotre Dame Club of Cleveland, the wives and children shared with husbands and fathers the spirit of Notre Dame. 
And they're still talking about it. —^.\bout how Father Patrick Peyton, C.S.C., "apostle of the Family Rosar>-." who was to have addressed them, was detained by in­tluenza in Pittsburgh. 
—And how Father Charles Marhccfer, M.S. Notre Dame. '45. instructor at Qulgley Pre­parator>* Seminary. Chicago, took his place, and spoke first to the children and then to the parents. 
—How he asked the youngsters to set their fathers and mothers a good example by loving one another and showing how to become as little children. . . . 
—How he pleaded with the parents to ex­plain the meditations of the Hosary so that it would become a living inspiration to the youngsters. .. . 
—And how he broke off his address, drew a Rosary from his pocket, and there in the hotel, to the astonishment of the waiters, led the men. women and children of Notre Dame in Cleveland's first public and corporative Family Rosary. 
They're still talking about it. and they'll be talking about it for a long time. 
Among other things, they are asking. "Why shouldn't the men of the University of Our Lady of the Lake do this all over the world?" 
Why not bring Our Lady's families . to­gether in, great family reunions at the altar? 
"What is wrong with the world can be said in a sentence," read the letter which the com­mittee sent our announcing the Family Com­munion. "The faltnily is falling apart. When the family falls apart, civilization falls apart too. The way to restore the family—and civilization—is to say the Family Rosary." 
It worked in Cleveland. And Cleveland Notre Dame men are asking: 
"Why not everywhere?" Joe Brcijr

hack to life. (During the War years, with

members and guests attended Holy Commun­
ion in a body and afterward had breakfast 
at the Hotel Bond In Hartford.

On Sunday morning. Jan. 13. the Philadel­phia Club at the University paid tribute to the memory of the late John II. Xeeson, "03, by attending Mass and receiving Communion in a body in Sorin Chapel, wliere the former member of the Associate Board of Lay Trus­tees and director of public works in Phila­delphia, had knelt in prayer as a student. Key. J. Huffh 0*I)onnell. C.S.C.. president of the University, celebnited the Mass. 
Breakfast followed at the Oliver Hotel with ICalph W. Ilayman, president of the club, presiding. The guests included James E- Arm­stmnfT. '25, Prof. Faul 1.

J. 31rehan, '20, national advertising .manager of the South Bend "Tribune." 
In his eulogy. Father O'Donnell described Mr. Xeeson's attributes of "lively faith, rich hunilUty and verdant love." The high esteem the University tiolds for such a man was elo(tuentIy expressed by Father O'Donneil in referring to his death—"One of the most bril­liant candles on the altar of Xotre Dame alumni was extinguished and we will never look upon his like again. .VIohg with the deep faith that radiated fi-om his own person­ality, his family life and his olliclal career, .lohn H. Xeeson was tlie possessor of. a rich delicious sense of humor. 
"That Johnj H. Neeson was a Catliolic Aclion­ist of the first order is confirmed by the fact tliat he was one of the charter members of the Men of ilalvern. the flrst organization that promoted the lay retreat movement in the United States. Little wonder Is it that this group wilt miss Iilm. for he was a veri­table rock of the organization." 
Summarizing. Fatlier O'Donnell had re­course to the beautiful cUamcterlzation of such a man in Bishop O'Hara's funeral sermon when he said .that "he observed faithfully the two • Great Commandments, love of God and love of neighbor.** Concluding, Father O'Don­nell said *'\Ve pray for peace to the soul of one of the greatest men Xotre Dame has ever produced.'*

Despite the competition of a typical Min­nesota sub-zero blizzard, we had a grand turn­out of 55 Dec. 7. for our Communion break-f:ist- Father Flynn, president of St. Thomas College, offered us the facilities of the college here in St. Paul and niade us quite at home in O'Shaunessy Hall. Father Flynn is a swell person, reminiscent of the faculty at Xotre Dame. The movie, "University of Xotre Dame" was much appreciated and it appealed not only to the alumni, but further, appealed to prospective students, through our newspaper publicity, to the degree that we had five future students in our turn-out. 
During the holidays we gathered again for our annual Christmas party. The usual attend­ance was further swelled by the return of a few more of the fellows back from ser\'ice, 
inclutMng Capt. Gene DeLay, '41. from a two­
\i 
year stint in Germany, and liis brother. Naval Lt. Bernard ]>rLa>-, recently returned from Guam and now residing in Nebraska. Lt. Gerry McKaj't '30, just out of the Navy after service In the Pacinc, and Lt. Gerald Conway, also an overseas veterjvn, were with us. 
Meantime, our "girls" have been carrying on with their monthly auxiliary gatherings, and much of t,he success of the club during this war period can be attributed to the sustained actlvltj- of this, our distaff side. 
Through their connivance, we have enjoyed several informal Notre Dame parties, a recent one, not yet erased from memory, being the occasion when we essayed to learn the rhumba. schottische, polka, etc., in one easy lesson. We have reorganized our ideas on the matter. 
We all are looking forward to 1946 as a year of renewed contacts and a return to full membership for our Twin City Club.

NEW HALL STARTED 

Extensive post-war expansion of hous­ing and other facilities at the University has started with the construction, al­ready begun, of a new $400,000 residence hall on the campus. 
The new dormitory, as yet unnamed, will be located in the freshman quad­rangle in the northeast section of the campus. Collegiate Gothic in design, it will harmonize with the architecture of the three other residence dormitories in the freshman quadrangle: Cavanaugh Hall, built in 1936, Zahm Hall, in 1937, and Breen-Phillips Hall, in 1939. It is expected to be completed in time for the fall term opening next September. 
Planned to accommodate 200 students, the new hall wU include latest building improvements, and will be ope of the most up-to-date structures of its kind. Among its major features will be a spa­cious foyer and a chapel seating 200 persons. 
The architectural firm of Maginnis & Walsh of Boston, Mass., which has de­signed many new buildings erected at Notre Dame in the last 20 years, drew up plans for the new dormitory. Thomas 
F. Hickey, Inc., of South Bend, is the builder.

One of your correspondents most enjoyable experiences was the visit to Xew Orleans for the Tulane-Xotre Dame game there. Seemed as though all the Southern delegates centered on the city for the affair—and the Xew Orleans alumni club did a grand job of enter­taining them. Charley De £<a Vergne, Bolon Barke and Cj'P SiM>r! are just a few of the names that c^ime to n\ind: a low bow to them for a grand cocktail party, at which the alumni could gather, meet old-time friends, and visit.

From Jack Saunden*: May I thank the ever so many kind friends of this "acting secretary" who were thought­ful enough to send Christmas greetings. And continuing thank-you's for all the individual letters which, added together, make a good *31 showing for the Februarj- issue. 
The reunion regional chairmen—Ban Iffolphi. Eddie Kyan, Bert 3Ialoney, and now Matt Cul­limin (as you now know, just back from the Paciiic theatre)—are something more than formulating plans for the members located in their geographical sphere of influence, and soon you will be hearing Increasingly more about the safari to tlie Fifteenth Reunion. From the letters whicli have come in—most of which have been carried liere in these columns—and from the meetings which I enjoyed in differ­ent parts of tlie Mid-West and East with the *3l'ers during the past football season, I have come to the conclusion that, qualitatively and quantitatively, the turn-out for "the big get-together" will set some kind of record for such events at "The Only School."

Capt. Matthew I. Cnllinan, 1316 l>inert' Blvd.» Oakland, Calif.: 
While we were wondering why "no mail from friend Matt" in answer to our many memos, he was something more than busy w^ith the Army on Yokohama. He was kind enough to promptly wire us an explanation just as soon as he returned to the States. It was good news to learn that Matt Is back. We hope to have more news to report on him in the next "Alumnus." 
William J. McAleer. l«t Ueut. Inf.. Personal Affairs Blv., A. G. Jk S. F. Red. Sta., Fort ORlethorpe, Ga.: 
AVrote that for the past 45 months he has been "making like a soldier." and at the time of his letter, he was sweating out Jan- 1, on which date he would be promoted to the exalted rank of civilian. Bill got in early, got 
and said he has been working hard all these

over early, and got back early, so since last winter he*d l)een working with returnees at the redistribution station at Fort Oglethorpe. Bill wrote most amusingly anent hfs personal affairs officer duties—"When these personal problem cases get loo lough for the chaplains, they send them to me. I operate an un­official confessional that would give you ma­terial for ten books. .. . If you couUi got it through the mails!" 
Lt. I>onuld E. O'Toole, 54lh M. G- lit|. & lln­0»., 7th IMv., A.r.O. vjii I»os(nia.st*T, Sail FranciMTu: 
AVrote on Nov. 11, explaining that he had started a reply to our first letter requesting news, but received his overseas orders shortly thereafter, and the subsequent confusion was just too much for his correspondence- Don is now a long way from Notre Dame—in a city in Korea, in the northern part of the American zone. He is one of the three naval officers attached to an Army Military Govern­ment company- His particular job is to take ciLre of all properties left behind by the Japanese, both civilian and militarj*. The work takes in some 7.50,000 peo!)Ie in the terri­tory and covers an area the equivalent of 20 counties In the States. Don naturally Joesn't run into very many Xotre Dame men where he is now, although lie told us he had put in a lot of time with Lt- Bill McCar­thy, *33, at Stanford University, had met a 
IX. McCarthy, of the calss of '-11, and one day encountered a Lt. Ca»*ry, '42, of O.shkosh, who is an aide over there to Brig. Gen. Stewart. Don also sent along the information that Jack ficddrs, Tlrhc Wotnls and Don's brother I*aul were still In the Navy, but he didn't know where they were. • Don's brother, Ju>tin, . '36, was discharged from the Army, and his brother Kevin. '42, is with the Marines at Nagasaki. 
Jame(» A. Bigicim. M. !>., 430 U'ainut Street, SliarpHville, Pcnni*yl\-ania: 
It was good to learn that Jim had arrived hack' in the States from England on the ••Queen Mary" on Oct. 16, and was separated at Indlantown Gap on Oct. 20- Jim was with the 5Gth Fighter Group (P-47"s), from Febru­ar>% 1944, until they got to Kilmer. Tom Bonie* *28, and Oene Curran. "SC. were witli his group. He met two other N. D.*ers who were with, the 314lh Troop Carrier Group and who transferred into his group to return liome. They are going back to school to get their degrees <BilI Hennrfi-^cy and Henrj- Keel). Jim reported, that Ed Madden, from Sharon. Pa., wa.s doing very well in his own law practice, but allowed himself to be drafted some time during^ the past summer, and shortly there­after was sent to the Pacific; Ed lias two children. Jim also hears regularly from l>an Bradlr.v, *2S, who is probably in Japan by now. and who recently wrote Jim about riding out tlie typhoon In an LST. Jim expected to re­sume his medical practice after he got through moving back into his own home and got an office set up.

We're happy to say that Jim is one of our most faithful correspondents. AVc had hoped to see him at the Iowa game, but though he and I were at tlie game, we somehow missed connections. I have come across an article that Joe Adams, in his "Rambling 'Round" column of the "Indianapolis Star" wrote on our friend Jim, and we think it so good, that we're including It in its entirety: "James D. McQuuid operates a news stand known as .Mac's Magazine Rack on North Sixtli Street. Vincennes. and it's heartening to know that it has saved him from the boredom of a semi-Invalid's life. Mac Is a graduate of Xotre Dame, class of 1931, and was a coach and athletic director until he was injured, and is now unable to walk without assistance. Tills was a tremendous blow to one so active, but he is happy now in his little stand, 5 1/2 
. by 7 1/2, extending over the sidewalk In Vin­cennes- He employs a schoolboy to put out the stocic each morning, and recently he estab­lislied a service which has been indeed help­ful. His helper delivers magazines, candles and cigarettes to the hospital three times a week, a service much appreciated, as :Mac well knows, by tlie hospital staff and patients. It just makes you tingle to hear of a guy like Mac coming through despite terrific handi­caps." We believe that Joe Adams, in one short paragraph, has expressed the admira­tion we all feel for Jim, We'll surely be looking forward to seeing- him In South Bend-Robert J. Sullivan, 33 Elm Kidre. Mattoon, lllinoLs: 
Spike Is still with The Carter Oil Company. He said that there are three members of the class of *3I in that vicinity: I'anI Grant, in Mattoon. is with the Central Illinois Public Service Co; and Tom Munahan, In a neighbor­ing settlement, is "the Broomcorn King." Spike said that "all are well and have some kids." Aside from them, the last '31'er whom he saw was Ed Murray who—to quote—"last summer was still at Great Lakes loosely disguised as a Navy lieutenant." [Ed is now back at Notre Dame as director of student accounts—Eds.l 
Mattoon must be pro-N. D.. for Spike said that other inhabitants who have had more than an acquaintance with the University are Xeil l4iuf;rlilin, '3S. and Dick O'Ctmnor, '4G, both of whom are .'••till absent in the Armv's behalf. 
In a second note Spike told ns that in Chi­cago last November, he spent some time w^lth Jerrj- Croniey, Hank Chamber)* and B»b Smith, fall of whom are busy fooling the public just like the rest of us." 
Julin J. Mc3Inrray, 7035 S<iuth Indiana Ave., ChicaxTfi 37: 
Wrote from Chicago, where he Is an attorney-He promised -that if the Fifteenth Reunion of the Class of '31 is held in South Bend, he will be among those present and participating. 
William A. Mirr|>hy, Av.'Juarez No. 30^-112, Mexico, ». F.: 
Was kind enough to write all the way from Mexico, D. P. Bill Is a civil engineer there constructed the military camp for conscripts in Mexico, D. F., and the Valsequillo Irriga­tion Canal In Puebla. Mexico- BUI was in San Francisco last winter and looked up Paul Cush­inr and Final Enrlipht—said they were doing splendid work for the war effort. In Novem­ber of *41 he was In Chicago and at Notre Dame, and said he ".saw good old Father !$teiner; he looks as he did the da.v I left school—not a day older-^and was very nice to me.." (South Bend Isn't too far from Mexi­co, and we surely do hope that Bill will be able to make the Reunion.) 
Kenneth J. Fishleijch, 3148 :t4tli Avrniii*, Soath, Minneapolb,: 
Wrote from St. Paul, where he is with the Seeger-Sunbeam Corp., as assistant tratlic man­ager. After leaving school he was with the home .office of the Hardware Mutual Casually Co., in Stevens Point, Wis., for six years. He "took the big step" after moving to the Twin Cities, and he and Mrs. Fii^hleigh tiow have a fine little boy, three and a half years old. He hears from Tom Monahan and said that when he was in Stevens Point lie regularly .saw Fred Kcinun, Ken's roommate during our junior and senior years. Ken also Informed us that Maurice Griffin is working in Chicago for a hook firm, and they oceaslonally get to­gether when Maurice gets up to the Twfu Cities.

 out of the Navy. Said he was delighted to be in one piece, and gives all the credit for it to the fact that he was on the luckiest ship in the Navy, for he believes that the 

U.
 S. S. "Phoenix" is the only light cruiser in service that wasn't hit In the war. Just to show you wliat Tom meant when he said "luckiest ship In the Navy:"—From the time they left the harbor at Pearl on Dee. 7. until the attack on Borneo, they had 30 torpe­does fired at them, and all of them missed. They" had suicide planes break up right over the ship, due to anti-aircraft fire, so that part of them fell on the starboard side and i)art on the port side, but the planes themselves landed In the water, Tom plans to go back to Notre Dame in ^larch to study law.

Charles H. Miltner. Elk's Temple BuildinK, Cadillac, Michigan: 
Charlie is an attorney and coun.st-llor. Charlie is now the proud father .of four childreii— John Henrj*. Charles. Jr.. Barbara, and six­months-old Benjamin Paul—and he claims that they and their mother keep him pretty busy. Charlie sees Joe Deeb (U. S. District attorney for the Western District of MIcIiigan) every week, in connection with some Federal con­demnation work they do for the Department of Justice. Charlie's brother Frank. '40. Is in Manila, a lieutenant in the Army, investigat­ing war crimes. We were extremely sorry to learn that Charlie's uncle. lather Charles C. MUlner, CJi.C., president of Portland Uni­versity, had a se\*ere heart attack last Novem­ber, and at the time Charlie wrote. Father Miltner was In the hospital In South Bend, convalescing. (We sincerely hope he is now well on the road to recovery). 
ThomaN R, AHbe. 1(9;:* l>rarlNini Street, South Gate. Oillfomia: 
All the '31'ers will be glad to learn that Tom is now a civilian and back at his old job with the Globe Oil Tools Company. Los NIetos. Calif. Our letters caught up with him just as he was arriving home from Shanghai, wliieh 
Volume 24, No. 1. February, 1946 
f;t Where we had him located when the last "Alumnus" went to preys. Tom really did some travellini?—last Slarch he was sent to the St. Louis, a cruiser, and while In search * of that elusive ship in the vast Pacific, he ran Into Fnuik L«ddy, a lieutenant in the Port Director's OtUce in Manila. Tom's stay there was brief, because he wa^ en route to an LSM for transportation to I-oyte. After an eight-day sojourn on Samar, he was sent to Oiiinawa on an LST. and about three weeks 
later found the St. Louis out In the East China Sea. . Tom was assistant communica­tions olficer for a couple of months during tht' final stages of the war. 
.Matthew P. Gurrivun. 17::01 Wurrinictoii Dr.. Detroit '^1, .Mivhiciin: 
Found our various memoes awaiting him wlien he returned home after a three-year­and-fifteen-day tour of duty with the Army. He found that a month oC rehaUUltating with the folks in Florida was just the thing to put him In shape for the rigors of civilian life, and lie Is convinced tliat tliere is nothing like taking "this change-over" In eayy stages. We have Matt's permission to put him down as a likely pilgrim to the Fifteen-Year Reunion, and he said it should be even better than the memorable "Tenth" in the lobby of Morrissey Hall. 
U . ,1. H. Askew, Naval Teehnical Tniininic Center, 87th St. at Anthony Avenue, ChieaBo: 
Was kind enough to drop us another note. He and your "temporary secretary" just missed connections in Chicago last October. At the time he wrote, Haskell was trying to lure ^ome of the Academy boys into a bet for tlic Navy game, but wasn't having much luck, for they were talking only about Navy's win­ning. 
John Weibler—Must l>y now be back in the States and almost—if not quite—a civilian once more. Our last letter to him. acknowl­edging the report he was kind enough to send in to us, and wliich we sent to liim In care of his F.P.O. San Francisco address, has just been returned with the notation "UndeUver­able, Xo Forwarding Address Available—Unit Decommissioned." That's surely good news to us. and we'll be hoping to hear from John himself soon.

On Jan. 2. started the N*ew Year right by answering our letter of Sept. 10, 1945, which incidentally, reached Ray wlien lie was busy in the Army. But lie is now a civilian, and home gain. Ray was In the Army a bit over two years. His duty sent him to Washington & Jefferson University for a few months, and from there he went to Camp Pickett. Va., to do classification work. Just before he was scheduled for the boat. Ray was suddenly transferred to Fort Devens to do psychiatric social work, which he found Intensely in­teresting. He did this for a year at Devens, and later at Camp Edwards. Welcome back, Ray, 
\V. II. H. Ginder. Jr., A'M Fifth Ave.. Vitts­hunch 30: 
Has been with the Carnegie-lUinois Stt.*el Corp.. for the past 12 years and is now work­ing as a development engineer in the sales department. He Is also president of tlie local Xotre Dame club. He Informs'"us that In the past nine years he has collected a wife and three children—two boys and a -girl. Bill ran into Jerrj- McKeever In Cleveland a while back, and says that "the former Eiiltor of the "Pot­ter's Herald* " is now living in Cleveland and is selling brass and bronze. If BUI remembers correctly, to the plumbing supply industry. Says Jerry gets around to a lot of the football games, and Bill was surprised that Jerry's name hasn't popped up in the column before this. Bill asked us to say that If any of the boys pass through Pittsburgh In their travels, he can be readily reached at Carnegie-Illinois and would be more than happy to visit with tlieni. 
Lt. J. A. Kua«ir, U.S.N.K.. Ad. Comd. Phltw Pac, F.P.O. San FranciMw: 
Wrote from Pearl Harbor, wlxere he was attached to the maintenance staff of the Pacific Amphibious Forces, and claimed he has the too widely publicized "Magic Carpet,'* from an up-keep point of view,-as a specialty. Jim reports that another "magic carpeter" is O . Art McGee. assistant first lieutenant on one of the Navy's new attack transports. Because Jim hadn't seen Art since THAT DAY in June of 1D31, he follows Art's ship closely, hoping it will eventually put in at Pearl; but fate seems to be against the two, for at the time he wrote, Jim said that Art was en route to San Francisco witli a load of high-point men from Japan, where ilac had had occasion to visit "atomized" Nagasaki- Jim Rudolf also told us that •!. C. SuIIi^-an, attached to the Naval Air Station at Deland, Fla., caught the recent ALN.W that finally remembered the Navy's erstwhile "ftjrgotten" senior lieutenants and made them lieutenant commanders, and in November lie was sweating out a bid for several months' duty in "the Land of the Rising Sun and Falling Atoms." Though it seems a long shot Into the future. Jim hopes that June of 'AG will find him able to be back at school for commencement.

Tlie "rugged Indiana winter," plus the 'Hu and sinus attacks, had Alyron "down" for a while. He asked us to say "hello" for him to Iloby Shean when next we see Hoby—Myron hasn't seen him since our five-year. reunion. Myron maintains tlmt if travel facilities were on an even keel, he'd be tempted to take off for CallCornift, just as Tom ^\she was trying to sell Hohy Shean that bill of goods on "the Sunset Trail."

Bob's work with duPont has taken him to a number of mid-western cities, including Grand Rapids, wiiero he has had several pleasant visits with «I*K! Deeh and his family. Bob. of course, re­confirmed the fact that Jiw Deeb is doing very well as federal district attorney. Bob also had a pleasant visit witli Tom ^lalmlTey in India­napolis In the early part of '45; and in Dayton. O.. last spring he ran into Tom Lantry (in from New York on business), and talked to. Col. Sol Bimtempo {then stationed at Patter­son Field). Bob also has talked vfa telephone with Al Steiuin in Chicago during a visit there.

I regret veo' much that I did not go out to school, but'I Just didn't have the time." On Jan. 6, Harry was on his way to Caractis from Miami, and it will be two years before he can com'e home again.

Come the class meeting at reunion-time, we think it highly desirable and equitable that a permanent class secretary, who is at the 
The Notre Dame Alumnus 
same time a capable columnist, be nominated and elected to carry on the' outstanding ivork that the late-beloved John Berpfttn did so admirably. John truly was entitled to a "cita­tion of merit." Affable John with his inimi­table resourcefulness, energy and dispatch, by plauning^ and proper direction, seemed to accomplish with ease and relisli that result which most of us would consider something only ncArly reachable. John Bergan truly was one of the best-known and most highly regarded class of 'arers, so the most we can hope for, I sincerely believe, is the selection of one who can most nearly approach his accomplishments.

From F. Jay Martin, 35 S. Grove St., East Orange, X. J., to TiKhe Woods: 
"Having lately become a civilian after having risen to the glorious heights of a full lieutenant in the Xavy, I've been busy getting readjusted to the rigors of civilian life. . . . "I entered the Xavy as an ensign in October of *-l2 and had five months at Cornell, where I met l»aul lillis of '42 fame, Phil Darmody, 
•33. John £mmert, '31. and others. Was as­signed from there to the USS Windsor APA 55, then building in Baltimore. Eventually we arrived In the Pacific where ICwajaleln was the first of eight invasions. Sailed around all those beautiful island paradises for over a year before getting back to 'Frisco for a nice session in dry-dock. (Ship not me.) 
"On the way back from New York after IS days leave, met Bed McCarthy, '33, on the train and had a great trip. Ited was also a two-striper. Looked up Danny Ilanlcy at Treasure Island where he was in charge of recreation, athletics, etc. He was the same old Danny and treated my wife and me to a very enjoyable evenhig-dinner and boxing bouts. (He was also sporting two stripes.) (If this gets monotonous, stop me and I'll in­troduce a j.g.) Another trip around the Pacific and the Windsor and I parted com­pany after 26 n\onths. Was at Newport, R. I-. awaiting a new ship when the war ended. (Met Lt. (j.g.) Eddie SarguN. '33. there.) After a couple of months, Halsey, Ximitz et al seemed to be doing all right so I retired. 
"Am now back in the purchasing department of Tileflex. Inc.. in Newark. We don't make girdles but rather flexible metal hose. During the war we were the principle manufacturers of radio shield ignition harnesses for aircraft engines.

From Frank J. KeUly: 
The mail from the men of '37 during the past couple of months has been about as heavy as magnesium, but. fortunately, not quite as strong. In fact, two cards, one from Wll Do*»Iey, announcing that copy was due for the "Alumnus** Jan. 15, and another from Jack llurle}-, announcing the arrival of his (carbon) copy, John (Jr.?)—weight: 10 pounds. 14 ounces—Dec. 6. were the sum total of the month's mail. Hey fellows! Come on. get on those Parker **5l's" and start writing. Luckily. there seem to be enough '37 men in Xew York for me to get on the • 'phone and get odds and ends of news from. 
Ed Hubking, for instance, told me, via the phone that he Itad been out of the Marines since Dec. 5, and is now with his father's firm. Conti Products, in. Broolilyn, where he is taking up Frank's old duties as secretary. Ed, who has three daughters, returned to the U. S.' last Xovember, after having been on Guam, I believe lie said, since the previous March. Prior to that lie was In the ground end of aviation at the Cherry Point. X. C-. Jlarlne training- station. 
Ed mentioned that Jim Wahlron. formerly 
of the F.B.I.. was in China with the Office 
of Strategic Services people. Jim's brother 
Joe, who was a class or two ahead of us. 
was a witness in the MacVay court martial 
proceedings In connection with the sinking of 
the U.S.S. Indianapolis.* Ed said. He also 
mentioned that Ed Rorice, of our class or the 
following one. had participated In the Bataan 
"Death March" and was not dead as thought, 
hut liad been a prisoner of war in Japan. He 
Is now at an army hospital in Utica. X. Y. 
Ed went mto the Army in 1940 and sub­
sequently was sent to the Philippines. 
Ft] Hniskinjr said he saw Bill Shea, '37. In 
October. Bill was with the coast artillery 
on Pelieleu. Ed also saw Gene liinr on the 
west coast when he was out there recently. 
Gene and Ed have something In common, both 
27­

having three children. The resemblance stops there, however, since Gene's three are ^ris. 
Another '37 trio mentioned by Ed were Bob McKeatinr* formerly of the Xavy, now back in Chicago; 3EaHjr Bams, also out of the Xavy, and presently back in the Windy City with a railroad supply firm, and G^fge tmne of Xcw York, who Ed says was married about a month before this was written. 
A second phone call put me wise to the fact tliat Fnuik **Pinky" Cmrroll has shed his khaki's, two silver bars, et al., and was about to become the master of a mansion in Has­brouck Heights, X. J. Pinky is back in the ink business with his Ave brothers and father, so I expect to see more of the young man from now on. He reports that CpK Al Schwartx, of the Air Corps and the 130 Army 
I.Q. rating, received his discharge in Decem.­ber and is now working with bis father In tlie hardware business in Saltna. Pinky tells me Bemie Xieior, a naval anti-aircraft officer. Is still on board ship. I believe the latter is also true of Jnslln XcCann, who was in New York, around holiday time for a brief whirl. Two calls to Justin at his home ;were unavailing, but I believe he will be back here permanently in' a few months. 
Passing through Pennsylvania Station early in December, I stopped to watch a line of passengers moving through the gate toward a waiting train. Before too long I spotted the familiar face of IAKIS Ataman, who re­ported iie was on his way to Philadelphia. I think IJOU lives and works there, although I wasn't able to verify it since he was hurry­ing to trj- to get a seat on the train and I didn't want to detain him. He looks very much the same. 
Bill Sharp, formerly of Summit. X. J., and now of Xew York, was on terminal leave from the Navy when I talked to him in January. He said he had seen quite a bit of the McXally's in the . Philippines. Incidentally, both Joe and Bill were in New York for the January meeting of the New York Notre Dame alumni club, which a cold and foul weather prevented me from attending. I learned that Jerry Gillespie, Ed Xesher, Harry Fierce, who Is also out of the Xavy. Bill S|uup, the two McXally's and 1V»ni Hnciics were at the meet­ing. 
Mark Ijonwrsaa, a neighbor of mine, called to say that he had met BUI lUlon In Janu­ary. Bill, an Army captain, was on terminal leave, and saw Mark at the Metropolitan I^e Insurance Co. In New York. Mark rejoined the firm when he received his naval discharge and I believe he said Bill, who also worked for the Metropolitan before going into the Army, was planning to go back with the firm. Bill is married and lives in New Rochelte. 
Mark also reported that he had seen Don Allen, the basketball wizard of our class, at Mass In our parish church a week or so be­fore. Was that another Notre Dame lad with you Don, and if so who and where does he live in Parkchester? Speaking of this place I understand Ed Hoyt, now In mufti. Is some­where in our midst. Speak up and be counted, brother Hoyt. 
Mark also wanted to be sure that I saw tlie "Saturday Evening Post" for Jan. 12. in which a 14. Vlnecnt W. Haitnett, USNR, and Notre Dame. 1937, unquestionably, had written a small piece on a war episode that appears on page 74, I had spotted it when I was reading C^apt.- Harry Batcher's Eisenhower Diary, along toward the middle of which Vince's piece appears. Vince demonstrates his usual ability, and as soon as he Is out of the Xavy he should have a full length piece in tlie "Post" before too long. He is a real writer. 
A while back I mentioned the dearth of mail. Well, after that lead had been written I received a letter from I*t- Comdr* (no less) 
J. V. Schilling. VSStL Joe writes: "Each time X read through the 'Alumnus' I get the urge to write, but like getting the urge to get a little exercise. It never lasts long enough to accomplish anything. 
The Notre Dame Alumnus 

'28 
"My initial duty in the Xavy was in the Armed Guard. While in it I ran into quite a few Notre Dame men including: Elni»*r Zen­nen Wuyne Millner, Tommy Junluii, ^o« Cnttty, JeiTj* OHlejqtic, Bill Ljiicli, Jut'k 51jih«iiey, Wally Fnmiliart and many others. When Armed Guard was wasiied up * on V-J day, I thought surely the Xavy would send mo home, but they had other ideas and I wound up here (Jacksonville, Fla.) in demobilization work. I still run into Notre Dame men— Binknu-ski, I>an Sheedy, etc., etc." 
Joe goes on to say that he has his wife and two children, a boy five and one half and a girl almost three, with him. His letter continues: 
"Would sure like to learn of the where­abouts of Cy Str"ker, Gene Ely and Larry Dan­bom. Have written to all three and no an­swers. As soon as the weather break.s I hope to get myself in one more Navy line and get myself separated. 
"I wonder how many *37 men who knew Phil B<indt realize that he has been putting up a gallant fight for over five years to re­gain hi.s health. I'm sure that he would appreciate a little mail." 
Joe enclosed IMiil ItiindiV atldress: Box S7T. Rockford. 111. How about it fellows? Don't you think we ought to do a job for Phil 7 
Well, here's the climax. This morning the llarj'knoll fathers were to make an appeal in our parish church. So, when the celebrant of the ilass announced the name of the preach­er: Fiither Joseph Kiigli^h. *37, I almost applauded. Joe did very well, and I had a hard time waiting till after Mass and Bene­diction to go around to the sacristy and con­gratulate him. Joe is the san\e swell guy 
h.e was at Xotre Dame. We had him over for a short visit in tlie afternoon, jind with the aid of Mark Lonergan got in quite a bit of reminiscing. Joe said he and lY. Cronan. (Boh) Kelly and Father E<I llaninier, another Notre Dame man. stationed here in the Bronx, recently had quite a get-together at luncheon. Bob Kelly, by tlie way, was supposed to be here for New Year's Day, but had to go to >lexico for a month with his superior. HaA-ing also missed Christmas with us, he's made a promise for a. St. Valentine's day visit. 
Wally Fronihart. recently discharged front Che Navy as a lieutenant, will return to Chi­cago Avhere he will resume his duties as head i^ootball coach at Mount Carmel High school wlien spring practice opens.

From Hal l^llliams: 
Top spot this month goes to this report: *'Augiist .Sidler, who. during his student days at Notre Dame was a resident of New York City, but is now a monk of tlie Order of St. Benedict, w;is ordained deacon in the Cathedral of SS. Peter and Paul, Providence, 
R. I., on Dec. 22. 1945. The Most Rev. Francis 
P. Keougli, bishop of Providence, was the ordaining prelate. 
"August, wlio is known in religion as Dom Peter Sidler, O.S.B., is a member of the Benedictine community at St. Gregory's Priory. Portsmouth, R. I. . . . After his graduation, August returned in New York city where, for a year, he did graduate work in philosophy !it Fordham University. He was then accepted as a postulant by the Benedictines at Ports­mouth Priory and under normal conditions would have gone to Scotland for his novitiate. However, the war made this impossible and while the Benedictines were arranging for the establishment of an American novitiate .at St. Anselm's Priory, Washington, August was sent' by Ids religious superiors to Harvard University for special language study. 
"In 1940 the novitiate was opened at St. Anselm's Priory and there August was clothed with the Benedictine habit and the religious name of Peter was conferred upon liim- He made temporary profession :L year later and began the study of theology at the Catholic University of Anierica. In 1942 he returned to his own priory at Portsmouth wliere lie continued his theological study and likewise ilid considenible work in the big art studio which in accordance with the ancient Bene­dictine tradition forms an important p.irt of the Portsmouth community's activity. . . . 
"Now that he has been elevated to the deaconate he is looking forward to priesthood. It is likely he will achieve this dignity with­in the next few months. Among those attend­ing the ceremon.v in Providence on Dec, 22, was Vincent MCAIOOM,- *34, who, having been discharged from the army after almost three years in Europe, was visiting his parents at Pawtucket, R. I." 
That was the first word we have had on Gus in a long time. Congratulations. Gus, on your vocation. I'm sure that the classmates will remember you in their prayers-
Gus w*iU be the fourth member of the class to be ordained. Joining F.ithers Bill Botztun, C.S.C-, Bill .Mahoney, <>-l'., and Joe Itiice. In­cidentally, how about some letters? 
The remainder of the mail is slim, but here it is. Bud Sherwoml. an ensign in the Navy, writes that he is still in charge of the nicest bar on Okinawa. If any of the boy.^ are out that way, drop in on him and ask him to set them up. Then there were Christmas cards from Jack Zerb>t (who was discharged from the Navy in Januarj*). Ed Bartiiett (who probably is back with the New York "Times" staff by this time). Jack Clwiry, Bill Woeruer (another lost .soul heard from—his addre.<<s Is 20S :Mayfair, Oxford. Place, Louisville. Ky.), Tom lIufvliinMm. and Father ISill Mahoney (his card was postmarked from River Forest. III. Or was it Oak Park?) 
You fellows have slipped in your corres­pondence. Now that the war is over and you are*home, how about dropping us a few lines telling us your status. 1 think we siiould hear especially from Gene Va»lett. l.on l>aPrii. Itus Ketlgute (I don't think he has ever re­ported to the "Alumnus"). CImrlie Webster. K»K Jortlan, George Simter. .U*v OleaMUt, T.ini­

And now, just two more things on my mind: I was discharged from the army Jan. 7, and am now back with the Baltimore "Sun" doing special feature work. 
Finally, a few words of pniise an(i thanks to Swede Bauer who carried on wlien I thought ! was going out of tlie country. .\ swell job. "Swede;" keep it up. 
From Swede Itaucr: I am inclosing a couple of letters I received while filling in for Hal Wi|Iiam> during his recent sojourn in the army. 
Tile first one is from Kd Slack, (;i.i7 N. McClellan Ave., Chicago. Date. Dec. 1.1. 1945: 
"I'm fresli out of the service, having en-li-sted in 1942. Had tanker duty in the Atlantic and eight months in ^fianil. I got around ;i good bit on that t.-inker, but it wasn't till I was stationed in Miami that I had the opportunity of meeting some Notre Dame men. Of our class was Ens. Johnny O'Connor, re­leased from the F.B.I, for service, who soon was assigned to -a DE in the Pacific. He spoke of Jolinn.v M'lNon and Frank Bright, who also were in the FBI. Joe Kuharifh. was our assistant football coach at N.T.C.. Miami, for a while, so I went out to practice for the fun of it until I caught a heavy knee in my ribs. 
"I was married Nov. 3 of this year to Kathleen Molloy, of Chicago. Art .\nder>on was our best man. Art has opened a law ollice at 09 AV. Washington St.. Ciiicago. He had just returned to the states after 33 months in' Italy, l-t. (j.g.) Ed .Munn just returned from Guam, will be out of the service this month. Last Saturday the three of us got together for dinner at the Bar A.**sociation and discussed all our classmates and professors and Notre Dame in geiienil. We intend to do that sort of thing often and invite others to join us. 
"While In New York I cro.-*sed over to Elizabeth. N. J., to see Phil Galletta. I dis­covered that he was In the army, but haven't been able to contact him. M. James O. Burgess, out in the Pacific, and 3Iario I'iemni. doing very well at law in ^luncie, Ind., both exchanged letter."? with nie." 
On Christmas eve I received a joyous .-lud newsy greeting from the old basketballer Tom Jonluii, 1632 W. 77 St., Chicago, 20:

Haven't heard whether or not Ray PindU is still lieutenant or has become mister. At last report he was at Letterman General Hospi­tal, still soldiering.

• '•' A St., Fortase, Wis. 
Froni .Scoup Scanlon: Here goes another cliapter in the Class of 
•42 news and we'll open the mail-bag with Lt. Dan CUnnle*s airmail communique; it was dated Dec. 7, 1945: 
". . . . the first person I ran into here in the 11th Repl. Depot, 2Sth Repl. Bn., was I-f. Jerry Ileinlen of our class. He's been over­seas with this outfit for 19 months, having made the arc from Xew Caledonia to Guaual­canal to the Philippines and to Japan. 
"I'm assigned to tlie same outfit, so we have quite a few bull sessions about the old days. I spent most of my time in the States with the I74th Inf., Regt.— going from one camp to another training replacements. Got close to combat only once when a trainee used Ken­tucky "Windage while flring on a problem one day. 
"Had an announcement of Lt.^ (j.g.) and now Mr. Jim Asmuth'8 marriage to a former chief yeoman in the "WAVES whom he met while stationed in Minneapolis. He was at an advanced Xavy supply base In Australia for about two years. Shot kangaroos for diver­sion out In his camp location. Also had an­nouncements of Dave Johnston's marriage in Ft. Smith, Ark., and of Charles Kirby's mar­riage back east in Great Xeck, L. I. 
"In the same company with Jerry Heinlen is another Xotre Damer. Sfft. Edward Cashman of the class of '43. Cashman had seen Faul Malloy, *43, earlier In the war In some of the Pacific Islands. There was also a Sgt. Teates of '43, here but he left about two weeks ago. 
"Chuck Evert, brother of Jimmy Evert, the tennis player. Is in Yokohama and we're trj'­ing to get together for some tennis and try­ing to get in the Olympic Tennis Tournament wliich starts sometime near the end of Decem­ber 1945. Just about this time last year, almost to the day, I visited Xotre Dame after taking a troop train to Ft. Meade, Md. Saw Prof. Imngtordf Frof. Ryan, Father McDonald, fMber Bolyer, and went to Chicago with Mr. O'Malley for a couple of days, where we met Pete Moulder and had a big time. Pete was just about getting his ar.D. when we were there." 
Xow let's swing back to the V- S. 
Big news on the sports front, especially **rom the Class of '42 scene of action, was the developments for such names as Steve Juzn'ik, Bemie Crinuuins and Steve BajEaras. 
Jnznik—the Touchdown Club, "Washington, 
D. C, named Juzwlk of the Fleet City, Calif., Xavy outfit, the outstanding service player. Juzwik recently signed with the Buffalo team of the new All-America Football conference. 
Crimmins—Bernle is a new assistant coach at Xotre Dame. Bernle finished the 1945 season, after his Xavy discharge, pl.aying guard with the Green Bay Packers. 
Bacams—Steve gained all-league halfback honors In the Xational Football league. Con­gratulations to the three. 
In LaCrosse. "Wis., I had a short visit with Mrs. James Rice and Tommy—the latter Is the dark-eyed newcomer of the Fllj^ht Officer J. (Red) KIc© family. .. . He and the mother reported that Jim is now an athletic ofiicer In the Tokyo area. 
Kay Dono\-an remains in the Department of Publicity at Xotre Dame as assistant to the new director, John Y, iDnkel, "29. 
Sounds like the Class of '43 can hold a get-together, Tokj-o fashion. Here's a report from lit. Jack Dinres* dad, F. J. Dinges of Chicago. Dated 3 Januarj*: 
"Your holiday greetings addressed to Jack have arrived and I am forwarding same to him today. Jack is In Japan, about 30 miles from Tokyo. I believe he has enough points to come home, but as yet it Is very uncertain when he will be separated from the Army." 
Lt. B4»b Coleman of the Transient Branch, Bldg. 1305, Camp Kilmer, X. J., comes through: 
"I am sweating out a discharge at Camp Kilmer, busily engaged in speeding the de­barkees from the ETO on to their proper separation centers. Am considered "essential" and at present am under a 'freeze* until Feb- 1. 
"The Commodore Hotel In XYC should be designated as the Xotre Dame Reception Center. . . . two weeks ago I was waiting for a friend and in the space of five minutes bumped into Jack Bergen, who has iust been diFcharged and at present Is working as an industrial engineer in I^ancaster, X. T., and is engaged to Evel>-ii Zlnk of St. Mary's. While chatting with Bergen, up walked Frank Foil-now who was attending a chemical convention; things began to take on the aspects of a con­clave when Xed Weinfaitner, a lieutenant in 

Volume 24, No. 1, Februonry, 1946 
the Xavy and stationed in NYC, walked up the stairs. . . . "We're still talking about that one. 
••Xatumlty we arranged a get-together for a couple of nights later and added to the above mentioned was Tom AValker and Jim O'Brien, both married (Walker's got 2 and O'B has 1 child), both Its. in the Navy and both to get out shortly. And of course Bud Concftnnun was there /ind very happy because he was to be discharged from the Army at Fort Monmouth the following day. So we pitched one at the Tim Costello's over steaks and beer until the small hours of the morn­ing. I understand Costello still shudders when he hears of "One for the Red.' 
"About a week previous to this I had run into Ed Mangioidurf in the Commodore who was just back from the Paclflc (DFG and all). He was on the carrier Bataan along with tarrj* llickey. I visited the ship but wasn't able to contact Hickey. This noon I had lunch with the 'Biggest of the Eds,' Ed Dunlary. -- He has been out about two weeks and is shopping for civics. His brother Jack, of the class of '43, was a marine figliter pilot and he too just got out. . . . The Dunlavy's now live in New York, Understand Jack iJarvcy is in town, recently discharged from the Navy. Oh yes, I ran into Fred Paulmann out in Bronxville, 
N. Y., this fall. He received a medical dis­charge from the army a year or so ago and is now in the importing business In NY^C 
"Tani Walker brings news of Vince Shiely who is with a QM trucking company, I be­lieve, presently sweating it out In France. I believe Vince's words are to the effect that he expects to be the last GI back from Europe. Bcrg:en tells me that Phil Lueier is stationed aboard the LeJeune. Inasmuch as I meet most of these ships that come into New Y'ork I had ought to run into him one of these days. Bergen also passes along the info that Jack Diamond is in England, a flrst looey attached to the Air Corps and generally not so happy with things there. Almost for­got to tell you that Chiu4ie Stelton. of the Class of '43, is stationed with Welnfurtner down at Pier 45—and who do you think their Personnel Olficer Is—none other but Tom Walker. 
"My brother Bill, of the class of '40, is stationed in New York. living In New Rochelle and I managed to get out and see him once a Week. . . looking forward to '47 and every­one else I meet from the class who, back in *42, thought class reunions a bit on the un­necessary side, now are also looking forward to our first reunion. It promises to be a humdinger." 
From Fort McCIellan, Ala., comes a report, dated 30 December, from Lt. Tom Powers: 
"Was fortunate in getting a leave for Christmas and went to New Orleans to spend the holiday with my girl-friend. It really ^^'as a Merry Christmas. Got my regular leave about a month ago and was in New Orleans for the N. D.-Tulane game. Met Coach Leahy. Father CaraiiaUfrh, John Donnelly, Mr. Ann­stmnc, Carl Coc:>. Adrian Pudo. Eddie Corey at the St. Charles after the game Saturday night. Enjoyed the game a lot. It being the first I had seen since the Army game in New York in '42. I understand Paul Neville is out of service and back with the.'Tribune* in Soutli Bend. 
"Received a note from Joe Petritx from St. Mary's Pre-Fligl\t recently. He expected to be out of ser\-ice soon and was anxious to get back to the trade again. Says he met Chuck Riffle. Lou ZantinI and Steve Juxnik recently. Heard from Joe Lane in October. He was rubber-necking around Subic Bay in tlie Pliilipplnes. Says he's almost resigned to stay­ing In the Na\'y forever. 
"Am living the fast, uncertain pace of IRTC, training the IS-year-olds. The way may have ended elsewhere but It's still going on down here in Alabama. Am getting plenty of fresh air, goo 1 food and sleep, which I gather Is good for people and helps them live to be a hundred or so. If I were a WAC or a nurse, I'd have just enough points to get out but as I am, 1*11 be here or some Army camp 
until probably late summer or early w^lnter. 
"My brother John is riding troop trains from Camp Anza, Calif., to separation centers and is really covering the country. Expect to have him visit me soon on his way back from Ft. McPherson. Ga. My brother. Father Joe, is studying at Harvard and misses Notre Dame, but finds the 'Yard' Interesting. Guess you Ivuow Jimmy is out of the Navy and back on the 'News* for several months now. 
"Oh, yes, I ran into an N. D.'er here the first day. Charley Kelsey, *43, a staff sergeant who works in Troop ilovement. He's expect­ing to get out soon and looking forward to going back to Notre Dame to finish his final semester." 
Those comments by Bob Coleman suggest a reminder that some of you Class of '42'ers who are more-or-less definitely settled in your new surroundings should send the Alumni Office at Notre Dame your new permanent addresses. It will help get this "Alumnus" to you sooner and \vill also provide a way to find some of you when you write in. 
Now let's switch over to the communique from Mrs. L.ora Lashbrook of the College of Law who comes through with her usual liberal supply of developments: 
Bernard Gniiney was In for a visit the middle of January en route home to Montana from the separation center. Barney is dis­charged and ready to enter the practice, having been admitted to the bar In ^lontana prior to his entrance into military service* Since he was wounded in Europe last year he was in the hospital for several weeks, then was as-# signed to the Paris olfice of the "Stars and Stripes," where he completed his tour of duty. 
Bill Simngler wrote before Christmas that he expected to be home for the holidays with his discharge for a Christmas present, but to date we have no confirmation of this. Joe Barr lias entered the" practice of law in Alton. III., where he is opening his own office. Jim Duner sent out formal announ::cments of the opening of a new office In his home town of Mount Clemens. Mich. At the lime he wrote in January he liad already had three clients. 
.Announcements of the birth of a daughter on Dec. 20, to Bill and Martha Ho^nski in Texas were received on the campus along with ' Christmas greetings. Cecil Jordan is out of the Xavy and visited us before Christmas. He was tlien hoping to locate in Chicago. 
Joe livery sent a Christmas card from Con­necticut where, we assume, he is practicing law by now. I^eo Linck is still In the Army and a recent letter was from his station down in Texas witli the Army Air Corps. Jack I-lnnigun is out of the Marine Corps and has registered for the ^larch semester to finisli his law study. Jack graduated from the College of Arts and Letters in 1942. Jack Tallett was a visitor before Christmas, as handsome as ever in civilian attire. 
Pat Flanagiin is doing a flourishing business in his new practice In Hamilton, Ohio. Ed Kelly and hts wife, accompanied by Boh SInon and his wife, paid us a visit In January. Bob Is out of the ilarine Corps and Is home trying to get acquainted with his little daughter who was born w'hile Bob was ser\*ing in the Pacific wltli the Marines. 
Jim McGoIdrick wrote some time ngo sug­gesting that he might leave the F.B.I, and enter private practice In New York. He passed the New York bar exams recently. John Vertlonk is practicing law In Bangor, Mich. Apparently he has had some clients since we had an inquiry for some Information on the conflict of state laws. Back In school from the wars now are: Ra>' Quinn, Bob Snllii'an, Bob Stvivurt. John M. Kelly. Harry Hanson, and Graham McGowon. The first year law class has enrolled a number of 1942 graduates from the other colleges, 
Lt. James Lancaster wrote tliis week (Jan. 
21) from his station at Robins Field, Ga., to say lie will be a civilian again the latter part of February- He thinks he will choose the middle west to enter the practice. Jerry 
0*Dowd is practicing in Fort Wayne, Ind., after completing a tour of duty aa an officer with the Navy. Jerrry was awarded the Navy Cross for extraordinary heroism in a landing operation in the Pacific. A Christmas note from J«hn' Speca came from Harvard where John Is doing graduate work In law. 
Jkl ChiriiH is practicing: law in South Bend. He was returned from his duties as a Military Governor in Frankfort, Germany, after going all the way from North Africa through the occupied countries into Germany. Some time ago we had formal announcements of the addition of John Ward. Jr.. to his father's law firm in Chicago, and we assumed he was out of service. VTe are told by Ed Krily that this is not the case and that John Is still in nni­form, hoping to get out within the next few months. 
Merr Basaa is considering^ several offers, among them an offer from, the legal depart­ment of the United States Treasury Depart­ment. 
Among the veterans who will be back in school in March, according to the records in the Registrar's office, are: Jack Ilonesan, Jim Claric, Bin Felling, Bon Patrick, Jenr Shea, Tom, Mitchell, Gerry Kamm, and added to this list are many others who have written that they are returning but whose actual applica­tions are not yet on file.

From Ed Rtiney: 
Here's hoping everyone had us Merry :i Christmas as he had dreamt :tnd prayed his first postwar Christmas would be. This should be the Happiest and Best X^ew Year the claims of •-J.1 has exporit?nced. This is the year we wiU start out on our own to find our place in the world. The best of luck to all of you from another begiuner. 
More and more of the class seem to be arriving back stateside and getting out- Han into Bill 3I(>orheud and Helen Ilealy at a coctv­tail party Xew Year's Day and while Bill was giving me some dope on a few of the fellows he very carefuUy "forgot" to mention that Helen and he were announcing their engagement the following Saturday. Congrats. Bill, from the class, and correct me if I'm wrong but didn't Helen and you meet at the 
. Junior Prom at X'otre Dame? 
Anyway, Bill supidied the following: 
IS«b McCaflTertj- was married in Chicago in late Xovember to Miss Margaret Harmeier from Cincinnati. Frank McGmdcr was best man and among '-jS's present were Jack Grifliii and Jim Byrne. Ftunk 0'.^lalle.v was also there- Griff had recently pucKed his Army uniform in mothballs while -Tim was a member 
. of tlie Great Lakes Separation Center staff. 
ICofre Cuniniiiig!« was reported in Xew York for a few days, still on his ship, while Jack Gillicran is now home in Cincinnati. FVaiik McGnHler does not believe in the old saying "always a best man but never the bridegroom" and will play the other part sometime in February. 
. The mystery of Te<l Burke's wlierealmuts wa.« solved in December. After some time in :i Pacific hospital, he was expected home Jind our around the first of the year. 
Long lost Jack iVinnn^ got around to writ­ing just before Christmas and had this news for the rest of us: 
"The recent 'Alumtius' came and, per usual, was enjoyed immensely. -After absorbing all from the class notes I wondered if I would be able te add a few names for the next column, ai.d I jotted down the names of those I've seen since return to the States. 
"Might as well start at the beginning, which, in this case, would date back to last summer. During my Army confinement. I saw few Xotre Dame men—though at one time there were five of us at one station—at any rate. I made up for lost time in the waning days of regimentation. .. . I caught Eil Hanrahan while he was furloughing prior to taking up residence across the street from Hirolilto. Ed hopes to be home for keeps in the summer. He told me that he had checked with his ex­roomie. Paul Weber, several times in AVashing­to«; Web was at the Army War College before he was sent to Frankfurt-on the Main in Deutsehlaud. 
"Big things liappened in the Windy City when Joe Callahan and Fre<l Gore visited. We had a great five day reunion." and if that is any indication of the planned *4.1 get-together —murder:: Fred produced pictures of the Scotch wedding ceremony. Their leaves cor­responded with my furlough, and we spent them well. Both. I believe, went to demob, school.s. 
"I spent a couple days in Cincinnati and night clubbed one of them- At the Xether­land Plaza I met Bob McBride. footballer on the 19-12 team. He. and It was getting to be a habit of most of my friends, introduced me to tile little lady. When I returned to the home town 1 met Juek Gilliicun and his bride of two weeks en route to Charlevoix. And during the same furlough (It wa.« tagged "re­cuperation":) I saw Gail Fiteh up from Xor­folk. 
•"KecUpenition was completed on the beaches 

« of Miami, with Uncle Sam catching the bill. After that I was sent to Ft. Benning and sweat it out there for tile lust iw-o months of Army career. One of the Xotre Dame men there with me was l>ick L'ngashick, *45, also an internee at tlie same P\V compound.s. We took in the X'otre Dame-Georgia Tech game in .\tlanta. It turned out to be a manager's convention what wjth myself. I'tttfashick, '45, John Shvetly and Kuke I^iCr<>lx. '3S. Joiin l>wnneli.v, '39, rounded out the staff. Tom ^lorri^oii, '-ll, and a rebel was al.so there; Tom was a manager, too: 
"Discharge came in X'ovember thereby giving me a cliance to see the lads in jiction against Xorth western- After the game I saw Ked Lonergaii, who had forsaken Col. McCormick at Tribune Square for a sales job. 
"Ilowiird Murloiv writes from Detroit, his new home town, that he had seen Frank Cbner several times. Jack Solon, trumpet ace of the Cavaliers, married an Oak Parker rt'cenily and Bob Kuaf was the best man; Bob is a- recent benedict himself. Grapevine informs me that Murk Lie> took steps along the same line. 
"1 made a novena recently at a shrine In the neighborhood and was aniiized to see Jack M(>rH>on there; amazed because he is an India­napolis man. He quickly explained as he, too. Introduced the Missus, that he was working for a security house In town. Bill MeCauKlir.v and I spent the good part of an afternoon on Randolph St. talking over the old days. Bill expects to be a civilian In a couple of months. 
"A week ago I made a trip to the campus; I caught the food strike that got nation-wide billing. It reminded me of the time we were deprived of those cherry tarts. wliile being evicted from tlie Dining Hall. Some of the old classmates are back there finishing .up what the Army or Xavy Department inter­rupted. Te<l Zitnik Is one of them; I visited his room in Walsh until an hour so late that I almost had to bribe the night watchman to let me out! The basKetbaU team licked Chan­ute Field the night I was there; between halves I talked with Jolinny Mcllale wlio had seen his B.adin room mate. Jack Warner, at the Army game. John S|»eeli(, starter in our frosh class in *39. is finishing up on campus. Jake Kline was the only one of the coaching staff there. 1 had hoped to see Wally Ziemlia, but Wally was pacltig the floor hoping his wife would present him with a future grid great. Caught Gene Felilir in a big rush to leave the campus for Chicago and a train to take his 
wife and himself to Montana.

"This note should help your column rival that of the Scooper." 
A letter from Eil McSamara that missed tlie last issue:

"I just got home two weeks ago, but have seen two copies of the "Alumnus" and have been following your progress—or is It regress? I was on the machine gun all the way. and* was wounded in France in the Vosges Moun­tains. Shrapnel in the face aiid head, but plastic surgery fixed me up like new. They could have given me a new face, but I got . the same one back. I did receive the Silver Star though.

The Notre Dame Alumnus 
Those of us who started out in Carroll and Brownson no less than five years ago will remember Brother Roman Wil«nvski, C.S.C-, who prcfected in Carroll for some time-Brother Roman Is now in Chicag-o and sent greetingrs at Christmas. 
"As a member of the class of 1944, your column in the "Alumnus" interests me the most. Of course, after prefecting: the second and third floor dormitories of Carroll Hall for four years, I also have hosts of friends in the other classes. 
"Since the fall of 1944 I have been teaching at Holy Trinity High School, 1443 -W. Division St.. Chicago 22. Several times a week I also manage to do some evening work at De Paul University. While in the Loop I occasionally bump into a former Carrollite or Xotre Dame man. Recently I .met Orlonili* Bonicelli, '44. He told me he was stationed now at the Great Lakes Xaval Station. He said he intended to go out for Great I-akes basketball team. 
"Throug-h your column in the "Alumnus" I wish tliat you would give my special 'hello' to all my friends who lived in Carroll Hall from 1940 to 1944. You mentioned some of them, as for example: Frank Carver, Art Ley. Bonicelli, Lyie Joyce, and a host of others. Also Harrj' Yrtttes, wJionx I never would picture in Japan. He and I sat next to each other in many classes at Notre Dame.'* 
'Black »?olin' Muri>hy is always good for one letter, so here we go with a short one of Xov. 2S. Incidentally, MurpU became engaged as of Dec. S. We got thar announcement on the back of a Christmas card, 
"I hear from Brother Meinnid. C.S.C, that ]>un Tniltier, Artie Mofrmun. Jim Finucune and others are back with him in Badin. That's sure great to hear. Tommy 0'Coimi»r tells me to address his letters to Springfield, HI., from now on, for he's headed home. I sure hope so. 3Iox Boj^ers is on his way. but no word from £mie Sedlmuyr in Austria. In fact, no mail from any of the boys. I guess you get snubbed when you revert to civilian status again. . . . Sure was a big surprise to hear of JeiTJ- Coleman getting snagged." 
Out of Miami, Fla., Earl Englert sends just a short note to let us know that he's still in there. This was Xov. IS. 
"Since last writing I have had a good leave, which included a trip to the campus for the Iowa game. Saw quite a few familiar faces and old friends. But it was quite strange to see a gp.me played between semesters with the student section vacant. 
"There has been little in the way of class news coming .my way. Bernie BotvHnfi- of Louisville was married last AugusL That's about all I know." 
Still in Florida we go to Banana River now for tlie latest from Bob Martintt. This was written Dec 21, while Bob was packing to go home for the holidays. 
"I just received an 'Alumnus' today and began to look through the pages to find manj­names that 1 knew, and of all things came upon my o^'n. - . . You were right about my finishing MIT in Radar; I did that last Sep­tember. Then the Navy finally gave me a leave after 13 months and I went home before re­porting to the Naval Air Tech. Training Center at Gainesville, Ga. Since I am in the airliorne technical group of tlie Naval Air Corps., they sent mc to the above for work in a Ground Controlled Approach unit, used for blind landings of aircraft. They have these units all over the world, so one can really have the chance to travel, as many have. 
"I have been with the unit since last Oct. 1, first at Gainesville, then this station for further experience. Tliey moved the entire command here as of Dec. 1. 
"I read about Dan Tomcik. Yes, he will be at Grosse He for some time yet. He came to see me in Boston last June after arriving on the Queen Mary from England. I have been wanting to know just where Tom Cooiie>' is no*.v. He is of the *43 class, and was in It.-ily about two years ago. His home is in Yonkers. N. Y. Also would like to know if John Gulftun. ex. '43, has been returned to this countrj- rfier his year as a prisoner. I have been writing to John Beyerle for some time, and had a letter from him about a month ago. saying that he expected to get home in January. I wrote to Farrcll Quintan, but never had an answer. Could you contact him? 
"JoJin O'Connell is still here waiting for orders for one of the GCA units. He is now on leave, but I will be happy to inform him that his unit is slated for China. Nice trip if you can get it. I saw Bill Sclieuch last June wlien he came to Boston on a short pass. He was with a DE out in the .Mlantic for a year. Met him at the O Club dance at the Statler. 
"I'd like to know where Ban Wiitcrbnrj- is. Last I heard he was at the Naval Air Station in Corpus. Heard that Charlie Kelly is a civie again. Not otilcially though, because as a gob he was still at-Corpus. B(»b Wittc went out to the Pacitlc after leaving MIT. He is a shipborne technician, and I guess he has seen much of the blue waters by now. Bob Sleuelniun, *44, from South Bond, was also at MIT. I tiiink he went out to tlie blue waters also. Sure was glad to hear about Jlerb Chirk. t hope he likes the new life. One more. I would like to know where Ji>e Kearney is. Last I heard he was in radar for the navy, just where I don't know. 
"I am leaving for Denver, home, next Mon­day. Uimn my return I expect orders. In fact, it is certain that I will go out as a re­placement for a luclcy discharged person on the Pacific coast. The place, which sounds verj' cold now, is Whidbey Island, about ninety miles off the shore from Seattle. Should be on my way the middle of next month." 
Bill Sc'henrh has gotten down Florida way .aiso, and is aboard the DB, Edward IL Allen, at Green Cove Springs. His letter was dated Jan. 3. 
"ily life aboard this "baby tin-can' Jias been an experience, but not a very exciting one. After going tlirough three Navy schools I picked up this ship at Miami in May, 1944. I was surprised and chagrined, tliough. when I discovered that it was a training slilp for young ensigns who wore attending NTS. Miami-And so for some months we plowed up and down the coast of Florida training officers with damage control problems, battle problems, night stations keeping, etc. Late In June. 1945, we were hustled off to Charleston for a so-called face-lifting. Then it was supposed to be off to the Pacific. But after our avail­ability at the Navy Y'ard. they headed us up to Casco Bay, Elaine, and there ive joined a task force under Vice-Admiral Willis Lee. Most of the work there was classified and quite interesting, and so for a while held us in chock. But the war ended and there wo sat.

NEW FOOTBALL TICKET 


DISTRIBUTION PLANNED 
A system of football ticket distribution which guarantees, under estimates based on present practices, the allotment of four tickets to each alumnus who is a contributor to the Annual Alumni Fund before July 1 of the current Fund year (with provision for including contributors from Dec. 1 pf the preceding Fund year) and who orders his alumni tickets between Aug. 1, the opening date of sale, and Sept. 15, the closing date of preference, has been atmounced by the Athletic Department. 
This new program seems to eliminate the source of the majority of objections which were received, bosed on the Sept. 
15 closing date, but also based on the possibility of an earlier 
became quicker and earlier each year. The new plan removes 
Since the latter part of the lIMn football season, representatives of the Athletic l>epartnient and the Alumni Asi^ociation have been study­inK a revised method of football ticket distribution, particularly with reference to alumni order?. 
Last senson the footbjiH ticket problem reached an acute staije: the Karnes with Navy and Army sold out earlier than ever before, with the result that many applicants—includintr a larjie irroup of alumni — were unable to obtain tickets. 
This situation can be ascribed to three reasons: first, in 1944 the ticket demand, especially for the Army jrame, v.-as heavier than in any year previous to that time, and many api)licants who had ajiplicd too late to secure tickets in 1944 submitted their orders on Arjtust I (opening date of sale) in 1945: second, most of the applicants who ordered at the bejrfnninir of the 1944 sale also ordered early in 1945: and third, many new or renewed orders were received from alumni in ^^n'ice who, after V-E day, knew that in all probability they would be released in time for the football >€ason. 
As a result of this study and in an attempt to provide a more satisfactoo* allocation of football tickets, the following plan will be initiated with the 1946 football season: 
1) At the beginning of the ticket sale, on Aug. 1. a block of tickets for each game will be set aside for alumni orders. The size of this block will be determined by the number of contributors to the 
 sell>out, which, in gomes like the Army-Notre Dame game, 
 the misunderstanding about this period of preference. 
current Annual Alumni Fund (between Dec. 1 of the previous year and July 1 of the current year) with an indi\*idual quota of four tickets permitted each alumni-contributor. Thus practical assurance can be Kiven the alumni-contributor that despite an early sell-out. he will receive four tickets for each imme, provided his contribution has been made between Dec. 1 and July 1-—and provided further that his order, for any came, is received by the Athletic Department by Sept. 15. 
2) There will be no need for advance sale for alumni under this reserved block system. The sale for both alumni and general public will open simultaneously on Aug, 1. as previously, and will run con­currently. With reference to the Army gsme. alumni may also submit an additional order on a "general public'* blank (also limited to four tickets) provided in this instance, however, that the general public sale is not closed at the time the alumnus' "general public" order is received. 
3. Alumni application blanks will te sent first-class mail to the address in the mailing list of the Alumni Association, to insure prompt deliverj* and possible forwarding. 
This plan is the result of the analysis of the suggestions from alumni received in answer to the invitation to submit such suggestions. Basically, they revolved around a reservation to guarantee a limited order in a siiecified period. The committee making the study feels that, until a method can be found for imtting 300.00U people into 7U,000 scats and then locating each of those seats "smack on the fifty, and not too high or too low," it is the closest approach which can be made to a Iiroccdare which will i)rove satisfactorj- to most alumni.
