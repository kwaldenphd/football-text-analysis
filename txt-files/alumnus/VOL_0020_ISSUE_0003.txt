ROSCOE POUND AT N.D. 
Soscoe Pound, dean emeritus of the Harvard Law School, and one of the foremost jurists in America, will give a series of lectures at Notre Dame on Jan. 22 to Jan." 26, inc. Kev. Hugh O'Donnell, C.S.C, president of the University, said in announcing these lectures: "On the 
•invitation of Dean Clarence E. Manion of the College of Law, and through the generous cooperation of an anonymous benefactor, I am happy to announce that Dean Emeritus Eoscoe Pound of the Harvard Law School will deliver a ser­ies of four lectures at Notre Dame the latter part of January." 
Dean Pound will take for his subject, "The Revival of Natural Law." All members of the Bar Associations in Indiana and many prominent lawyers are expected to attend. 
Father O'Donnell said that Dean Pound is the first of a group of distin­guished American scholars to be incited annually to lecture to the students of the College of Law, according to the policy adopted by Dean Manion and the faculty of the College. 
Dean Pound has had one of the most distinguished careers in the history of legal education in America, culminating his work in the Har\-ard Law School, of which he was dean from 1916 to 1936. He is the author of several recognized books and is a widely quoted authority. 
FATHER BOLAND'S PAMPHLET 
A pamphlet entitled "The Popes and Christian Citizenship" containing ex­cerpts from Encyclical Letters of five popes, compiled by Rev. Francis J. Boland, C.S.C, '18, dean of the College of Arts and Letters, has been issued by the social action department of the Na­tional Catholic Welfare Conference. Deal­ing with the citizen in all aspects of his social and political life, the handbook discusses authority and origin of the state, natural rights, the family educa­tion, and government. The excerpts were carefully, chosen from the letters of Leo XIII, Pius X, Benedict XV, Pius XI, and Pius XII. 
Father Boland in 1935 organized the present Department of Politics at the University. Last year he collaborated with the Rt. Rev. Msgr. John A. Ryan, D.D., of Catholic University, in publisli­ing the textbook. Catholic Principles of Polities, which is now used in many Catholic colleges and universities. 
HANLEY EXHIBITION A water color exhibition of Francis J. Hanley, assistant professor in the De­partment of Arts, will be shown in Chi­cago, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Reading and Fremont, O., Ferdinand, Ind., and several other cities. The 24 painting ex­hibition opened Nov. 20 at Mundelein College in Chicago and will remain there a month before being taken to the other cities for display periods of three or four weeks each. 
Many of his water colors are marine, depicting the sea in its diverse moods. A few are scenes from about Notre Dame. 
Mr. Hanley studied water coloring in Kyoto, Japan, as a traveling fellow of the Rhode Island School of Design. He was a student of Benjii Asada. 
PRESS MEETING Delegates to the midwest regional meeting in Huntington, Ind., of the Cath­olic Press Association were guests of Rev. Hugh O'Donnell, C.S.C, president of the University, at a luncheon preced­ing the Notre Dame-Illinois game. At the luncheon the group was addressed by the Most Rev. John F. Noll, D.D., editor of Our Sundai/ Visitor, and by Father O'Donnell. At the meeting in Huntington on Fri­day, Clarence E. Manion, dean of the Law School, spoke on "The Press and Americanism." 
• MATHEMATICS REPORTS Research papers by members and stu­dents of the Mathematics Department at Notre Dame are featured in the latest issue of Reports of a Mathematical Col­loquium, edited and published at the Uni­versity. 
Two papers are devoted to the new foundation of non-Euclidean . geometry which Dr. Karl Menger, head of the Mathematics Department, presente d three years ago to the National Academy of Science. 
Non-Euclidean geometry replaces Eu­clid's postulate about parallels by an­other assumption, while retaining the remainder of Euclid's principles. This one exception leads to strange results, contradicting those of ordinary geome­try. The science has found numerous applications in modem physics, particu­larly in the theory of relativity.

An abstract of Mr. Jenks' doctoral thesis has already appeared in the Pro­ceedings of the National Academy of Sciences for 1940, an unusual honor. 
The first mathematician to receive his doctorate at Notre Dame has also con­tributed a paper to this issue of the Reports. He is the Rev. Bernard J. Topel, now of Carroll College, Helena, Mont., whose paper, represents the solution of a problem begun in the summer of 1940 at Notre Dame. 
Other papers of the issue, by Profes­sors A. N. Milgram and P. M. Pepper of the University faculty, deal with anal­ysis and metric geometry, and their ap­plications to the various branches of mathematics. The current Reports is the third in a series which is being published annually under the sponsorship of the Mathematics Department. 
McCLURG ELECTED 
At an Oct. 31 meeting of the Indiana State Conference on Social Work, Pro­fessor J. J. McClurg, of the University faculty, was elected to the board of di­rectors replacing Judge Daniel Pyle, cir­cuit court judge of South Bend, whose term as a board member had expired.

Clubs to Key New Alumni Program 
Board of Directors Launches Drive Through Clubs to Boom Alumni Financial Program for Centennial 

President Harry F. Kelly and his Board of Directors, after several confer­ences with Club and District oiiicers and the administration of the University, offer the following program to the Clubs and the Alumni Association as a whole, as a fitting contribution of the alumni to the 100th anniversary of the University of Notre Dame: 
1. Increase of participation by alum-' ni and non-graduate former students in the financial program of the University. (Through the personal approach possible with the cooperation of the Clubs, it is hoped that the present annual low figure of some 2,500 contributors will be raised 
The Notre Dame Club of Chicago accepts the proposed plan to increase the living endotwient of the University, which will enable it to extend the field of cdtteation even more than it has in the past,

Notre Dame Club of Chicago.

far higher toward the total potential of 20,000.) 
2.
 Increase the amount of annual con­tribution. (The objective of the new pro­gram is a fund to exceed the cost of operation of the Alumni program by. approximately $100,000 annually, and minimum, which sum will be turned over to the University as unrestricted income to take the i)lace of income from endow­ment which the University lacks and which the alumni cannot now contribute. The present per capita contribution av­erage of only 95 cents per lay alumnus is not enough to pay the cost of opera­tion of the Association itself, but the Board feels confident that with the new objective the welfare of Notre Dame, and with the story being told by the ~ Clubs to the immediate memberships, this problem will be solved and per cap­ita contributions multiplied.) 

3.
 Make the work of the Alumni Asso­



ciation in this program so effective that the support of non-alumni, — friends, educational foundations, corporations, etc., — will be secured by the force of your zeal and your example. 
Through articles and pamphlets, you are aware by now of the major problem of Notre Dame. 
/ heartily endorse the general idea of making the Alumni Association truly a national fwee. for the advancement of our beloved Notre Dame. The attempting of any such program through the local clubs will not only assist the University on the road to even more glorious achievement, but it loill redound to the advantage of the individual alumnus in his own etymmunity. Never yet has Notre Dame been found wanting. Her faithfxd alumni, with renewed loyalty, will, I feel sure, give her the generous assistance in her present endeavor .which she so richly deserves. 
—^HENRY HASI£Y, PRESIDENT, 
Notre Dame Club of Fort Wayne. 

Lack of endowment has brought the 
University to a position where further 
progress is imperilled, and where the 
various substitutes for endowment-^ath­
letic income, unremunerated services, 
students fees, etc. — no longer are ade­
quate. 
The University is on the threshold of the realization of its greatest oppor­tunities. 
No alumnus need be told of the chal­lenge to all higher education. And no alumnus need be told of the particular .opportunity, and the particvilar urgency, for the Catholic university in answering this challenge. 
Notre Dame is practically at the bot­tom of the list of colleges and universi­ties of any size or scope in the matter of permanent endowment. One million dol­lars is our figure, against the thirty, forty, fifty and hundred millions of in­stitutions with which the public, and fre­quently you as alumni, expect Notre Dame to compare favorably in all other ways. 
The new program is based on the prin­ciple of the Living Endowment. 
You would, with probable factual basis, be appalled if you were asked this year as alumni to contribute $2,000,000 

We in Detroit feel that in the numer­ous Notre Dame clubs scattered thrmi(/h­out tlie United States and other coim­tries, our University has the nucleits for building one of the most solid alumni or­ganizatixms in the world. Each local club can bring the University and the univer­sal Alumni Association right down to each individual akimnns, and in turn, can bring each individual alumnus right back to the University. Detroit heartily endorses your program. 
—JAY L. LEE, PEESIDENT, 
Notre Dame Club of Detroit. 

If we who attended the New York meeting are_ able to give to our local alumni only a portion of tlie enthusiasm and sincerity of purpose of mir national association officials, I knoio our combined efforts will be tremendously successful. The aim is to coordinate alumni activi­ties with activities of the University. Harrisburg will do its part. 
—JOHN J. MCNEILL, PRESIDENT, 
Notre Dame Club of Harrisburg. 
FROM PRESIDENT KELLY 
"Alumni of Notre Dame: 
"It has been a privil^e, as Presi­dent of the Alumni Association, to receive the confidence of the adminis­tration of the University. 
"Father O'Donnell and Father Cav­anaugh are genuinely worried about the financial future of the University, especially as it affects adversely the ability to render the service to stu­dents, alunmi, and country associated vrith Notre Dame in her first 100 years. 
"After studying with them the fi­nancial statement of the University, I cannot but agree that the small mar­gin of profit between total income and expenditure is far too low even for safety, and certainly far too low to permit Notre Dame to meet the fu­ture in the same splendid way she has met the past. 

"Tha response of the Clubs to which we have talked before launching this program generally is my great con­solation for our own future, and for the future of Notre Dame." 
to Notre Dame's endowment. But if you will respond to the program presented, so that we realize annually from here on, a minimum $100,000, then Notre Dame will be as well off, since that figure rep­resents a very generous return on a two million dollar investment, which is all that endowment could be. 
There are some 20,000 Notre Dame men, the majority of whom can be reached through the Clubs. An average of $5 from each would obviously fill the bill. 
By the same token, it is equally obvi­ous that only the millennium will pre­sent that happy picture. Cutting the ob­jective of donors in half — 10,000 — there is still a major problem of coopera­tion, of approach, of your individual in­itiative in response, of a realization of the nature and the need of the program. And there is a doubling of the necessary per capita average. 
That makes a reasonable basis for a start, though far too optimistic. 

One plan suggested calls for the ap­proach to the individual on the basis of $1 a year for each year out of school. This relieves the young alumnus, and gives the established alumnus an equit­able opportunity to multiply his re­sjMnse. 
However, this was pointed out and should be remembered. Many young 
The well planned idea of the Alumni Assodation will perpetuate in our mem­ory fowr great years of the past; and give us an opportunity in the present to rejoice in the new successes and tri­umphs; and in the future increase our hope and antidpation—when we mingle our own existence with the students of today. 
—JOHN J. WINBERRY, PRESIDENT, A^otre Dame Club of New Jersey. 

The Notre Dame Alumnus 
alumni are happily situated, and can 
give generously, while many older alum­
ni have had their obligations increased 
with their years. 
It resolves itself into an honest weigh­ing by the individual alumnus of what he can give toward the creation at Notre Dame of an annual fund which will per­mit the alumni to aid the University to realize the opportunities constantly pre­senting themselves. 
That the realization of these oppor­tunities — molding of American thought, preservation of American principles, advancement of professional skill and learning, development of culture, strengthening of the spiritual fiber of our society — will reflect with profit on you as well as on your University, needs no emphasis. 
Notre Dame, through approaches like Father O'Donnell's "Do You Remem­ber—" and through articles in the ALUMNUS like Father Cavanaugh's "Case for Notre Dame," and through literature issuing from the Public Rela­tions office of J. Arthur Haley, will keep you informed of the needs and of the opportunity to assist in meeting them. 
The Alumni Clubs can do most to say whether by June, 1943, the Association will have taken a proper place in the otherwise glorious picture of Notre Dame. 
The Notre Dame Club of Neiv York, under the chairmanship of George Rohra, treasurer, and the solid support of the Board of Governors, intends to launch its endowment drive on Nov. 27 at a joint meeting tvith the New Jersey Club. Our plans have been carefully prepared and we expect nothing short of complete cooperation from the local membership.

Notre Dame Club of Neiv York City. 

As 'Notre Dame men, our motto is: — Far God, whom xue love and serve; For Country, wlwse rvelfare is our prime con­cern; and For Notre Dame, tohom we slumld support.

—ADRIAN J. WACKEBMAN, PRESIDENT,

Professor E. J. Maurus, '93, Dies 
Had Given 45 Years of Devoted Service to N.D. 
One of Notre Dame's noblest men, Prof. Edward J. Maurus, B.S., '93, M.S., '95, for 45 years a teacher in the Uni­versity, died in South Bend on Nov. 26. 
He was buried in his native Seneca, ni., on Nov. 28 following a solemn requiem Mass in St. Joseph's Church, South Bend, celebrated by Rev. Hugh O'Donnell, C.S.C, president of the Uni­versity, assisted by Eev. Eugene P. Burke, C.S.C, as deacon and Eev. Henry 
J. Bolger, C.S.C, as sub-deaconJ Eev. Wendell P. Corcoran, C.S.C, pastor of St. Joseph's, a one-time student of Prof. Maurus, preached a touching sermon. 
The pallbearers were aU faculty asso­ciates: Dr. John M. Cooney, Prof. Fran­cis W. Kervick, Dean Emeritus Thomas 
F. Konop, Acting Dean Raymond J. Schubmehl, '21, Prof. Walter L. Shilts, '22, and Prof. Clarence J. Kline, '21. The final three are all former students of Prof. Maurus. 

Bom on Aug. 12, 1874, Prof. Maurus began his teaching at Notre Dame in 1894. Brilliant in science and eng:ineer­ing, he became best known as a profes­sor of mathematics and was made head of the Department of Mathematics. He was a member of the American Mathe­matical Association and a fellow of the 
A. A. A. S. Unto he was married, on July 7, 1926 to Mrs. Mary Hogan Wil­cox, Prof. Maurus resided in a tower room of Sorin HalL He retired from active teaching in June, 1939. 
Surviving him are his wife; a step­daughter, Mrs. Gerald E. Hoben, of Seneca, HI.; two brothers and two sisters. 

Such are the facts, necessary but not the story of Prof. Maurus' life. 
Much of the real story is told in the statement concerning him by Eev. John 
J. Cavanaugh, C.S.C, vice-president, as follows: 
"The campus this morning grieves the loss of Prof. Edward J. Maurus, who, 50 years ago, came as a student to Notre Dame and who, for 45 years, until June, 1939, had been an active member of the faculty. Edward J. Maurus was much more than a distinguished professor of mathematics. His Tower Eoom in Sorin Hall was for 30 years a refuge of con­solation and encouragement for students and faculty members alike. From that room many a boy drew the inspiration and ideals for his future life. 
"In the absence of the President, Fath­er O'Donnell, I express to the bereaved ^vidow the profound sympathy of all at Notre Dame. Prayers will be offered fre­quently that the thousandfold reward may crown the long, imselfish, and ser­viceable life among us of Prof. Edward 
J. Maurus." 
Much more of the real story of Prof. Maurus' life is in the anecdotes of his former students, in the affectionate mem­ories of his associates of the faculty, in the walls of that famous tower room of Sorin which, for 30 years, served so many hundreds among students and re­turning alumni as a fortress of strength, and devotion to Notre Dame. 
Professor Maurus 

"He was one of the strictest disciplin­arians I have ever known in the class­room," says one of Prof. Maurus' former students. He demanded, and received, absolute attention. One of his favorite devices was to lock the door of his class­room when the bell rang; then to require any latecomers to knock on the door to gain admittance and subsequently to make, before the class, oral explanations of their tardiness. The result was that there were few latecomers. 
"He believed in the student as an indi­vidual and he used almost every con­ceivable method to bring out the best that was in a man. With one it was daily "riding," with another it was spe­cial work. In the classroom Prof. Manros 
dents learn despite themselves. "Outside the classroom he was a dif­ferent person—kind, generous, patient. Almost any hour of the day or night found at least one of his students in that tower room in Sorin. Alumni, some of whom hadn't been able to understand Ms methods when they were students, returned there in later years to thank him. He was a remarkable man. He gave everything he had to Notre Dame." "I remember Prof. Maurus once telling me," says a Notre Dame associate, "of the agonizing decisions he had to make when he had opportunities to leave Notre Dame for work elsewhere. He knew that he ought to go, for his own financial advancement, but he didn't want to leave Notre Dame. And he often cried over making the decisions. That he always stayed at Notre Dame is the final evi­dence of his devotion to the school and especially of his self-sacrificing devotidti to the ideals of Catholic education." May he rest in peace! 
Bulletin! 

Following the declaration by Congress of a State of War, on Dec. 8, Rev. Hugh O'Donnell, C.S.C, president of Notre Dame, sent the following wire to Presi­dent Roosevelt: 
"Notre Dame pledges her unswerving loyalty and devotion to you, our Presi­dent and Commander-in-Chief, and prays Gtfd to strengthen and guide you during the critical period. Our full facilities are at your disposaL Respectful greetings." 
At the same time Father O'Donnell issued a formal statement for the Uni­versity as follows: 
"The hour is come. Our Chief Execu­tive and the Congress have spoken. We are at war with its accompanying death, bloodshed, and suffering. Our armed forces will respond to the call as will all true Americans. 
"Today, Notre Dame is one. She has known the grim horrors of past wars. The fact is that the peaks of her history aire shrouded in the mists of war. In accordance with her strong tradition of patriotism, the University pledges un­swerving loyalty and devotion to the Commander-in-Chief of our country arid places her facilities at his disposal. We stand united behind him <ind pray hourly to God to strengthen his arm during the perilous days that lie aheadi We also bespeak Divine Guidance for Congress and all military and civil mthorities in the execution of their trust so that in due time our country may be victorious .and peace may be restored to the people 
of the world who love and cherish it." 
The Notre Dame Alumnus 
Board of Trustees Is Expanded 
Four Outstanding Alumni Are Among Eght New Members Added; Father O'Donnell Ex­presses Sympathy at Death of Angus McDonald. 
Kev. Hugh O'Donnell, C.S.C, president of the University, recently announced the expansion of the Notre Dame Board of Lay Trustees from 16 to 24 members and the addition of eight new members to the board. The expansion. Father O'Don­nell said, came as the result of the regu­lar fall meeting of the board, on Nov. 14, and was agreed upon unanimously be­cause of "grave conditions prevailing generally, the increasing scope of the University's interests, and the oppor­tunities presenting themsdvos with the University Centenary, which will begin next September." 
Four of the newly elected members are Notre Dame alumni. They are George 
L. O'Brien, '93, South Bend manufac­turer; Terence B. Cosgrove, '06, Los An­geles attorney; Walter Duncan, '12, La Salle, 111., businessman; and Joseph A. LaFortune, '16, Tulsa, Okla., oil man. Also named to the board were John J. O'Brien, South Bend businessman; Jo­seph P. Kennedy, former ambassador to Great Britain; Charles T. Fisher, presi­dent of the Fisher Body Company, De­troit; and William J. Corbett, Chicago businessman. 
The board of lay trustees, organized in the fall of 1920 and composed equally of alumni and non-alumni, is charged with the responsibility of holding, invest­ing, and administering the endowment funds of the University. The members are elected for six-year terms. 
Notre Dame's endowment, though rel­atively small, $1,000,000 raised by spe­cial campaign in 1921, has been admin­istered by the board and survived intact the economic upheavals of subsequent years. 
George L. O'Brien, a member of the class of 1893, is president of the O'Brien Varnish Company in South Bend, and director of the City National Bank and Trust Company of the same city. While at Notre Dame he aided Dr. Albert Zahm, then a faculty member, in some of the pioneer experiments in aeronautics in this country. He has been an active and generous participant in Notre Dame affairs for many years and is the donor of an annual prize for excellence in chemistry. His son, Eugene, was gradu­ated from the University in 1935. 
Joseph A. LaFortune was bom and reared in South Bend. During 1915 and 1916 he attended the University, work-
Angnis McDonald, '00, lay trustee, died on Nov. 15, the day after the fall meet­ing of the Board. Father O'Donnell said of him: 
"Notre Dame has suffered a severe loss in the death of Angus McDonald, of the Class of 1900. For almost half a century he was keenly interested in all phases of the life and development of the University. His advice and counsel were always at the disposal of his Alma Mater, and he gave generously of his time when she called on him. Behind his quiet reserve was a strength of charac­ter that endeared him to his fellow men. 
"As he rose to eminence in American industrial and business life, as president of the Southern Pacific Company, he did not only not forget his friends, but, whenever he could, gave them a helping hand along the upward path that he had come — the hard way. When I say that Angus McDonald was one of Notre Dame's distinguished sons, I am not thinking of him in terms of the position he held. His charming modesty would not pennit of it. I am thinking of him as a man who held steadfast to the prin­ciples he learned here so long ago. His school looks upon him as an exemplary Notre Dame man. It can pay him no higher compliment. 
"The University extends its sincere sympathy to Mary McDonald, his de­voted wife and constant companion dur­ing his many useful years of life, as well as to the Southern Pacific Company, and prays God to grant him speedily the eternal reward which he so richly de­

ing his way through a special two-year course in advertising and commerce. After serving in the naval aviation ser­vice during the World War and with Ked Cross after the war,-he joined the staff of the Tulsa World, and then the staff of the National Petroleum News. In 1923 he became assistant secretary of the Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Asso­ciation, and the following year joined the Warren Petroleum Corporation as secretary. Then in 1929 he became War­ren vice-president, which iwsition he still holds, along with several other top posts in the oil field. 
Terence Cosgrove, a Los Angeles at­torney with the firm of Cosgrove and O'Neil, received his LL.B. degree from Notre Dame in 1906, and later his LL.M. from Yale University. From 1908 to 1910, Mr. Cosgrove was a professor of law at the University of Illinois. An out­standing legal authority on water rights in California, Mr. Cosgrove is a special counsel for the Los Angeles department of water and iwwer. He recently finished a brilliant case before the U. S. Supreme Court on freedom of the press, as attor­ney for the Los Angeles Times. Mr. Cos­grove received an LL.D. in 1938 and gave the Commencement address of that year. 
Walter Duncan, a business man of La Salle, HI., received his Ph.B. from the University in 1912. Mr. Duncan's wide business interests include insurance, banking, and oil; he also serves as a director of the Marquette Cement Com­pany. As the father of two Notre Dame men, Vincent, now in school, and Walter, Jr., '38, as a former treasurer of the Alumni Association and as one of Knnte Rockne's intimate friends, he has always been close to the University in all its as­pects. 
A prominent business leader as well as a former ambassador to Great Brit­ain, Joseph P. Kennedy, of BronxviUe, N .Y., delivered the Commencement ad­dress at Notre Dame in June, receiving an honorary LL.D. from the University. BIr. Kennedy was graduated from Har­vard University in 1912, and holds hon­
orary LL.Ds. from the National Univer­sity of Dublin, Edinburgh, Manchester, Liverpool, Bristol, Cambridge, and Notre Dame. In 1934 and 1935 he served as chairman of the Securities Exchange Commission, and in 1937 as chairman of the U. S. Maritime Commission. He is a member of the Catholic Harvard Club. 

Election of Charles T. Fisher, presi­dent of the Fisher Body Company, is a recognition of the services rendered by the late Fred Fisher, his brother, who was vice-president of the board at his death and a member since 1926. Charles Fisher is the second of the . Fisher brothers. Together with his brother Fred, he became a mechanic and the two boys went, in slack times, to Pittsburgh, Chi­cago, and Pihiadelphia to work. It was Charles T., who wth Fred, launched the Fisher Body Company in Detroit, and Charles has been made the successor in many positions held by his late brother. 
William J. Corbett, president of the 

C. W. Marks Shoe Company of Chicago, has for many years been active in Notre Dame affairs in that city and on the campus. Mr. Corbett has been a gener­ous benefactor of the University in many-phases of its development,' and is the father of a Notre Dame graduate, Wil­liam J. Corbett, Jr., of the class of '27. He is a member of the Chicagro Athletic, Edgewater Golf, Beverly Country, and South Shore Clubs, all of Chicago. 
John J. O'Brien, of South Bend, is a t^vin brother of the late Miles O'Brien, who was a member and treasurer of the first board. Together they developed the • South Bend Lathe Works, of which he is now chairman of the board of direc­tors. He is also chairman of the board of the St. Joseph Bank and Trust Com­pany and donor of the Miles and J. 3. O'Brien Fellowship in metallurgy and applied sciences at Notre Dame. 
Festival to Climax Centenary 
Symposia and Lectures to Feature Academic Event. 
An academic festival will climax the programs of the University of Notre Dame's Centenary in September of 1943. Beginning in September of 1942, a pro­cession of highlights in the various phases of the University's academic life will move toward the concluding week, which is announced by the Eev. John J. Cavanaugh, C.S.C., Director of the Cen­tenary. 
The first part of the festival week in the fall of '43 will be devoted to sym­posia in the field of current problems of politics and philosophy. The symposia will bring together leaders of the na­tion in a discussion of topics in these two vital subjects, already g^reatly de­veloped by the contributions of the fac­ulty of the University. 
The second part of the week will be occupied with a series of lectures by some of the eminent Catholic and non-Catholic scholars of the day. 
During this second part of the festival week delegates from American institu­tions of higher learning, from the great learned societies of the country, and from the outstanding research foundations will be invited to be present. The week will be brought to a dose by a special con­vocation at which honorary degrees will be conferred on a ntmiber of the nation's most outstanding scholars. 
The preside^it of the University will officially proclaim the Centenary in Sep­tember of 1942. During the ensuing school year various national groups of academic, spiritual, cultural, and social significance will hold conventions at the University. 
Among groups which have already made definite plans for meetings at Notre Dame during the Centenary are: 
The National Catholic Educational 

Association 
The American Catholic Philosophical Society 
The Indiana Academy of Science 
The American Mathematical Society 

(Midwest, meeting.) The American Mathematical Society (Indiana Chapter.) The American Association of Teachers of French (Indiana Chapter.) The American Chemical Society (St. Joseph Valley Section.) 
Supplementing these academic meet­ing—and there will be others announced as plans of the organizations are c<nn­pleted—will be outstanding cultural pro­grams for the students and friends of the University, similar to the annual music and lecture series conducted by the University, but augmented for the centennial program. 
Spiritual emphasis will be given dur­ing the year, with the bringing of many 
i 
Church dignitaries to the campus, publi­cation of a Notre Dame prayerbook for students, alumni and friends, and spe­cial services on the campus, commemor­ating the many historical and Church feasts of the year. 
The athletic program for the Cente­nary will bring an outstanding list of opponents in all branches of intercollegi­ate sport to the campus. This phase of the Centenary will be launched with the National Intercollegiate Golf Tourna­ment on the Chain-O'-Lakes course in June, 1942. 
Publications of the University, includ­ing a history, and special publications in the field of graduate research, biog­raphy, religion, and literature, will be concentrated within the scope of the cen­tennial program. 
Students will naturally enjoy first­hand participation in the general pro­gram, but special plans for student ac­tivities during the Centenary are being discussed by a committee of students and University officials. 

Alumni are making plans through a committee on alunmi participation to make the Centenary and its many phases the occasion for return to the campus. From the opening in 1942 until the close in 1943, Notre Dame expects most of the 20,000 scattered Notre Dame men from the 48 states_of_the_Union to attend one pniBbre^f the centennial events. __—­
• Plans are being formulated for a civic committee _ on alumni participation to.  ty's own interests. Many contacts within 
V the St. Joseph Valley are-an-integral part of the-Centenary, and particularly appropriate in the history of the mutual development of Notre Dame and the sur­rounding area. 
During the summer session of 1943, the religious and lay students of the Summer School, which will be observing its own silver jubilee as a part of the University's program, will join the Cen­tenary program with a pageant, a sjmi­posiimi, and other observances during the six-week period. 
Father Cavanaugh, Director of the Centenary, has expressed the general objective thus: 
"The painting of a proper picture of Notre Dame as it closes its first 100 years as a part of the American scene will have many and varied details. It will not be possibe to cover them all in any year. But in this Centenary, the University hopes to bring to alumni and to friends and the public such a clear presentation of the developments of the first 100 years that the close relation­ships established during this year wUl remain constant and mutually beneficial in the years ahead." 
400 N. D. Men In U. S. Service 
Notre Dame men from JPortland, Maine, to Portland, Oregon, and from Savannah to San Francisco, are serving their country in the Army, the Navy, the National Guard, and the Marines. On land, on sea, and in the air, 400 sons of the University are doing their utmost to make U. S. a symbol of liberty, security,^and hope in a war-warped and twisted world. 
Within the last ten months six alumni have been killed in plane crashes. Cap­tain Richard • S; Freeman, ex. '29, En­sign John Patrick Ffrench, '34, Cadets George W. Weber, '40, Joseph C. Foley, '37, Oliver Paul Helland, Jr., '39, and John T. Von Harz, '40, have given the most that men can give for their coun­try, their lives. 
Of the 401 N.D. men who, according to the latest figures available in the Alumni OflSce, are putting their individ­ual talents to work for their country, 315 are in the Army. Of these, 51 are in the Army Air Corps, 8 are members of the XJ. S. Cavalry, and 20 are in the Medical Corps. Four priests of the Con­gregation of Holy Cross are serving as chaplains in various Army camps. Bish­op John F. O'Hara, C.S.C, D.D., '11, for­mer president of the University, is Mili­tary Delegate in direct charge of the religious activities of all Catholics in the armed forces. 
Of the 53 alumni now serving in the 

U. S. Navy, 22 are members of the Navy Air Corps. There are 26 alumni who are Marines, three of them members of the 
U. S. Marine Aircraft Corps, and one who is a member of the Marine Para­chute Battalion. Two former N.D. stu­dents are in the National Guard troops. 
Two alumni, John V. L. Flynn, '36, and George Mack, '36, are somewhere over England in the R.A.F. Two alumni have joined' the Koyal Canadian Air Force: Francis Dalton Slough, '33, is a flying ofiicer in the R.C.A.F., at Moun­tain View, Ontario, and Lionel V. O. Smith, '33, is a Royal Canadian observer bomber pilot. 
The four priests now serving as chap­lains in the various Army camps are Father Robert W. Woodward, C.S.C. '28; Father George J. Welch, CS^C, '29; 
315 in Army and 53 in Navy Accord-
ins ^° Latest Rgures; Several Are in 
Foreign Service; Death Roll Grows. 
Father Joseph D. Barry, C.S.C, '29; and Father Edward K. Fitzgerald, C.S.C, '30. 
The University's former registrar, Robert B. Riordan, '24, was called as a major in the R.O.T.C. and is now sta­tioned at Purdue University. Editing and publishing the 106th Quartermaster Journal, a Camp Blanding, Fla., weeWy, is Mitchell Tackley, '34, who, while at Notre Dame was managing editor of The Scholastic, Notre Dame weekly. Fenton J. Mee, '40, is finding excitement in the U. S. Marine Parachute Battalion; and so, too, is James J. Sherry in the Balloon Barrage Division at Camp Davis. 
Of the many Notre Dame men on duty outside the United States, Stanley J. Partyka, '38, is a second lieutenant in the 1st Marine Brigade in Iceland; Ensign Joseph A. Durkin, '34, is a naval aviator on the U.S.S. Chicago at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; and Joe Gore, Jr., '40, is in the U. S. Army Air Corps at Bel­lows Field, Waimanolo, Hawaii; Ralph Wachter, '39, in the Marine Corps, is on service in Puerto Rico; Robert E. Kin­ney, ex. '43, is a Jamaica Base contrac­tor, in the West Indies; Mario G. Tond­li, '39, Adrian R.'Martin, '39, and Ser­geant Thomas Foy, '38, are at Fort Stotsenburg, Pampanga, in the Philip­pines; Major Raymond R. Brady, '24, is a Judge Advocate in Quarry Heights, Canal Zone; William J. Began, '41, a private in the 70th Medical Battalion, is 
BULLETIN 
A press-time note brought word of the tragic death of Lieut. James 
T. Connell, '40, of the Army Air Corps, killed Dec. 3, in a plane crash in Africa. A telegram from Pan-American Airways to Jim's parents said "death was caused in the performance of his duties," but gave no other details. Jim, with four other aviators, was among the passengers on the Capetown Clipper's flight, Nov. 10, from New York to Leopoldville in the Belgian Congo, which inaugurated the Pan­American's South African route. 

at Fort Clayton, in the Panama Canal Zone; and Joseph W. Mdiring, Jr., "SS, a lieutenant in the U. S. Marine Reserve Corps, is on foreign duty. 
Members of a small group of spedaUy selected Signal Corps .Reserve Officers, now on temporary duty in England as students and military observers getting practical exijerience for later service with the U. S. Army Aircraft Warning Service, are: Second Lieutenants Joseph Kaltenback, ex. '41, Robert F. Sngnet, '41, and Joseph M. Quinn, '39. 
The following is a list of Notre Dame alumni who were, up to Nov. 25, 1941, serving their country in the military forces. The list should be read with the following conditions in mind: 
1.
 We know it isn't complete. Inevit­ably there are many, perhaps scores, of names omitted. Bat it's as complete as the irregular and somewhat sketchy in­formation of the Alumni Office, gathered from numerous sources, can make it. We'll of coarse welcome additions, fnnn the omitted men themselves or from their families or friends. The additions will be printed in the ALUMNUS from time to time. 

2.
 The addresses, we know (where there are addresses at all) are not, in the nature of things, too accurate. liGIi­tary men move too fast these days. Here agrain, well welcome changes '(and ad­dresses of those for whom we have none).

The Notre Dame Alumnus' 13 
By JOSEPH S. PETRITZ. '32 

ATHLETICS 
In our book, and we do mean the November ALUMNUS, Francis William Leahy was coach of the year. 
It took another month for the writers of the nation, voting in the New York World-Telegravi poll, to make it official; and our only point in mentioning this is to urge you to make those contributions. Scoops like that at these prices make this magazine a bargain you can't afford to miss. Borrow the green, if you must, from Freddie Snite or Bob Gorman at Local Loan—^but don't allow your sub­scription to expire. 
Note to Jim Armstrong—let me know how this goes over. I may want to get paid for these dispatches. 
From all of the foregoing, you can see that the recent season has left your in­terpreter a little on the daffy side. All of the fine points we made about Frank Leahy and his assistants have not only proved themselves, but the . Fighting Irish of 1941 went considerably beyond our modest prediction to finish undefeat­ed. That line is just in there for the archives, and so is the following: 
Notre Dame, 38 : Arizona, 7 Notre Dame, 19 : Indiana. 6 Notre Dame, 20 ; Georgia Tech, 0 Notre Dame, 16 ; Carnegie Tech, 0 Notre Dame, 49; HUnois, 14 Notre Dame, 0; Army, 0 Notre Dame, 20 : Navy, 13 Notre Dame, 7 ; Northwestern, 6 Notre Dame, 20 ; Southern California, 18 
At the last time of going to press, we said you might venture the question, "So what?" in response to a listing of the first five victories. We hope you did, because then we can say, "so take a look at the rest of the record." 
The last four games were something. The same experts who selected our man as coach of 1941 are agreed that you can throw out the Army game. The rain and mud that day were designed for de­fensive football. Blockers couldn't get traction, particularly in the gumbo of the Yankee stadium infield; fast backs were slowed to a walk, and passing was all but impossible. Kain was the only defense that stopped Dippy Evans and Steve Juzwik and Accurate Angelo Ber­telli from passing successfully all year. 
The old canard about "It rained on Army, too," doesn't hold, either. The Irish of 1941 were designed to out-score the opposition. Army most likely would have scored on a dry field—^we believe the Irish would have out-scored the Cadets. The figures show that Army— and you can throw in Navy, Northwest-em, and Southern California, too—out­played Notre Dame. They won the sta­tistics, but did not ont-play Notre Dame. 
In the Army game, for example, the Cadets had five first downs to four and some advantage by rushing and passing. Yours is the only expert who has taken the pains to point out that, the elements making it a defensive football day, the Irish played defensive ball. They punted more frequently than Army on first and second down. The Cadets often waited until fourth down to kick. The Irish played for a break, and it didn't come from the well-drilled, inspired charges of Earl (Red) Blaik, from whom we do not mean to detract one whit This is between us and the experts, and we just want to point out that Notre Dame was trying to win the ball game, not the first downs or yards from rush­ing. That Notre Dame did not succeed, we shall ^always believe, was the fault of the weatherman. 
The Navy game was the top of the year in our book, in this case this issue of the ALUMNUS. The Middies had better material, more power, better physical condition, greater experience, and finer spirit than any other opponent on the schedule. This, we emphasize, is a purely personal opinion. The day the Irish ran and passed to a 20 to 13 victory, there were no four-leaf clovers in the new sod of Baltimore Municipal stadium. Notre Dame presented Navy with one touch­do\vn, on a sUghtly under-thrown pass by Mr. B. The Middies roared back twice to tie the score, and each time Notre Dame went ahead again. Navy, its spirit never slacking, put on a couple of more roars in the last quarter which Notre Dame muiSed with one of the greatest displays of sheer courage these eyes have seen, rivaled this year only by the per­formance against Northwestern. 
. No depreciation of Northwestern is meant when it is pointed out that Leahy's tigers were wounded and bruised from the Navy game and were below their physical and emotional peak for their 7 to 6 victory over the 'Cats. Yet they manufactured tn-o scoring opportunities, seized on one to win the game, and let the other one go because it was more important to consume time than - to waltz out the fancy and (dangerous) stuff as the game drew to a close. 
Second-best performance of the sea­son, we'd say, was in the finale against 
Southern California, when the Trojans,

the season appears below. Most unsung hero—Bob Maddock, sen­ior left guard who played in the middle of the five-man line and was at the bot­tom of a lot of pile-ups where his num­ber couldn't be seen from the press box. He missed about seven minutes of the last four games. 
Least-mentioned for all-American— Owen (Dippy) Evans, key man of the Irish attack, who played 180 minutes in the last three games, and 55 minutes against Army, carried the ball more and further than anyone else, never gave in to constantly battered legs, and did the Irish punting. He's missed because there are only four all-American backfidd JMJ­sitions, and others had the jump on him in the pre-season build-up. 
Least conspicuous linemen—Capt. Paul Lillis and Jim Brutz, tackles, who the real experts say were so nifty that they never stood out while playing almost perfect football. They took the brunt of the power attacks of the last four op­ponents, and with very little relief. Lillis, who developed more aggressiveness than he had shown in two previous seasons, was an intelligent, inspiring leader. 
Best-spirited squadman — Johnny Ko­vatch who rode the bench for six games of his senior year while a junior, George Murphy, a former high school rival in South Bend, started and starred. Kovatch got his shot against Navy, and he made several all-American teams on his play in the last three games—^because he was ready! 
Best-under-pressnre — Steve Juzwik, who played indifferent ball in early games, in relation to his ability, who didn't appear to be in shape until Coach Leahy ordered a flock of laps-around-the­field for him the Northwestern week. Steve saved the Northwestern game at least four times by great defensive plays, contributed the extra points that won the Northwestern and Southern Califor­nia games, and played 60 minutes in each of the last two games. 
Best-passer-we-ever-saw—^Angelo Ber­telli. Also as sweet a defensive back as we ever hope to see. 

Most-improved-player—^Wally Ziemba, a fine natural tackle last year, and a great center this year, particularly on offense where his passing was near-per­fect. He had one or two defensive lapses, none of them costly, but usually com­bined with Kovatch or Murphy anil Ber­telli and Lillis to make the right side of the field no man's land. 
The real all-America kids — Bob Bove and Bemie Crimmins. They went into The Notre Dame Alumnus 
almost every game with painful, al­though not serious, injuries. Their exam­ple of courage and determination in­spired the rest of the team. Both played as if the success of every game hinged on every play, and as if the success of every play depended on them. It was up to the hilt, all out, total football war for them every minute they were able to drag themselves off the turf for one more play. 
BASKETBALL 
When Notre Dame defeated Franklin College, 49-30, on Nov. 29 to inaugurate the 1941-42 basketball season, it regis­tered the 300th cage triumph since Coach George Keogan relieved the late Knute Bockne of basketball coaching duties in the 1923-24 season. 
Coach Keogan wasn't too optimistic over prospects for the current team after 
•viewing the first-game victory. "There were lots of rough spots in our play, and these cannot be smoothed out until we determine our best combination." he commented. Charles Butler, slim junior forward from Chicago, filled the left forward post vacated by the graduation of Capt. Eddie Riska. 
Newcomers to the Notre Dame lineup who looked good were Bob Fanght, six-foot, five-inch sophomore center, John Hiller, from East Bemstadt, Ky., by way of Santa Fe, N. Mex., and Johnny Nie­miera, forward from Chicago. 
Frank Quinn, Indianapolis, center, George Sobek, two-year veteran forward from Hammond, Ind., and Cy Singer, lanky guard from Jasper, Ind., were r^­ulars a year ago. Capt. Art Pope, Chica­go, has shifted from forward to a guard berth aside of Singer. 
If Butler continues to spell Biska in the scoring columns, he will solve the major problem for Coach Keogan, now in his 19tb season at Notre Dame. Biska­last year totaled 174 points. It was the third year, in a row that he had led Irish scorers. His three-year total «f 608 points is second only to Johnny Moir's 780 for three seasons, 1935-6, 1936-7, and 1937-8. Coach Keogan is again di­recting play, almost folly recovered from a heart ailment which kept him out of action the final month last season. Ray J. Meyer, Chicago, and captain in both the 1936-7 and 1937-8 seasons, is again assisting Coach Keogan. 
Other names likely to appear frequent­ly in Irish lineups are: Bob Rensberger, guard from Nappanee, Ind.; Charley Olieary, guard from Cincinnati; Jim Engel, Albany, N. Y., guard; and Ray Kuka, Havre, Mont., guard.

IRISH TROJAN HORSE WINS Notre Dame's version of the Trojan horse, gigantic Dillon Hall replica of mythical history, captured top laurels in the Interhall c(»npetition for decora­tions during the Southern California Homecoming game week-end. . . . Mor­rissey's elaborate version of Modem Design — emphasizing Notre Dame's su­premacy "On the Land, In the Air, and On the Seats," ran a close second. . . . The Trojan horse depicted Irish fifth columnists, green-dad Notre Dame foot­ballers, emanating from the mid-sections. . . . Arnold Lnnn, British Catholic lec­
turer and author, visited the campus late in November and remained long enon^ to say that Spain's mfllions are hoping and praying for a Nazi Germany defeat, contrary to reports that may be shifting toward the United States. 
WHCS PLAYING WHO? 
Joe (Flash) Nugent, Chicago senior, currently protests crowded ctmditions on Badin-Beg;-.- .-.Phiying-safety for one of the touch football teams the other day, Nugent leaped into the air, inter­

cepted a pass, and galloped 40 yards for a touchdown. . . . Only one flaw in the performance: Amid the confusion of seven games in operation simultaneous­ly, Nugent had inadvertently interrupted one game and grabbed the wrong team's ball.... Breaking precedent: After three years of no-date reputation, a quartet of seniors recently fell victims to the call of St. Mary's. . . . The honor roll in­cluded: Ed Geraghty, Brooklyn, N. Y.; Jess DeLois, Millinocket, Maine; Sig Wesolowski, Shirley, Mass.; Bob Flynn, Washington, D. C; and Harry Flana­gan, Manhasset, N. Y . None objected 
to the experience.

Campus clientele hopes g^nest speakers include A. Hitler — and J. Stalin. . . . But Father Carrico empha­sized that the professor will be — Wil­liam Shanahan. 
6-1 ODDS? BUT WORTH IT 
Though odds were 6 to 1, 600 Notre Dame seniors welcomed the opportunity the Wednesday before the Northwestern game to participate in the drawings for chances to buy the 100 end zone tickets for the Wildcat encounter. .. . A special meeting in Washington Hall produced an old-fashioned raffle, and 100 Notre Dame men were spectators at Evan­ston. . . . Each of the 31 freshmen initiated into the University Band dur­ing the student trip to Baltimore wore an eight-by-eight identification, plus. . . .

I have just received a letter from Jimmy Cooney, '43, saying that the youngsters of the Boston Club of Notre Dame held the initial meet­ing for the year Oct. 20. His letter brings out two facts important enough to be passed on to the Boston alumni for some serious thougbt. 
^fty-three students from Boston and its vicin­ity attended that meeting, and if memory serves me light, therein lies the nucleus of as large and as active an undergraduate group as the club has ever seen. It would seem that, ance every mem­ber of the campus group is a i>otential member of the local alumni club, the interest of every mem­ber of the latter body should be more than a passing one. The Bost^n-Notre Dame campus club has been almost dormant during the last few years. With & start like this year's, it is cer­tainly deserving of the utmost cooperation and support from the alumni. 
They extended to eadi and every. one of the Notre Dame alumni and thdr friends in or about Boston, an invitation to attend their Christmas Formal Dance at the University Club on the eve­ning of Dec. 26. Looks like an ideal opportunity for all yon single fellows to give that best girl of yours a first-hand view of all that Notre Dame ^irit you've been talldng about. Tbe married brothers have an excellent chance to make good that promise made, sometime last summer to the "little woman" to take her out stepping, and at the same time keep well within the &mily budget. The tax is but three-thirty, and that wouldn't even get you by a cover diarge on New Year's Eve. A swell evening is guaranteed. A little effort and proper schedule arrangement will assure you ail of a most pleasant evening.

Before you could say Angelo Bortda BertcUi, it happened. The lethargic giant arose, stretched, rubhed the sleep out of his eyes, then suddenly 
•went berserk. 
Ihe sriant is the Chicago Club. It has been sluggish since mid-summer when the annual golf tournament -was held. Hie fall has been marked by little stir of activity. But the rainy season came, someone dropped a handkerchief. President Clark-whipped up a hatch of alphabet soup, and here is the net result: 
The officers, board of governors and a group of interested alumni met at the Knickerbocker Hotel on the eve of the N.U.-N.D. game and joined in an informal "clinic," led by National Alumni President Harry Kelly of Detroit. Harry pointed up the past problems of the Alumni Asso­ciation, its current debts to the Univeraty, the necessity for alumni generally, led by such large organizations as the Chicago Club, to set up a plan of operation tvliich would make the Associa­tion solvent and eventually result in the Associa­tion's becoming a benefactor rather than s mill­stone as far as the University is concerned. 
The meeting was informal, in the Donnybrook tradition, and Hr. Kelly kept the addenda vrap­eriy added up. Father Frank Caranaafh, C.S.C.. Jim Armstrong and Bill Dooley were up from South Bend and kept the gathering supplied with facts and figures relative to the diseossion.

It was the meeting's resolution that the needs of the University, as outlined by President Kelly, warranted the support of alumni generally and that the Chicago Club, subject to the mechanics set op by its offieers and governors, would attempt to bellwether the coming campaign. 
Cafe sodety received a rude jolt on Nov. 29 when the guys who wear tails and the gals who wear diiffon changed the locale to the Knicker­bocker's grand ballroom. Tlie Chicago Club's an­nual formal dance took place on that evening. Johnny Harlow's band dispensed the jive stuff and from 9:30 p.m. on Terpsichore turned over in her grave. 
Peter BL KeUy, '41, who spent a lot of time in the other fellow's backfield, was general chair­man of the event. He was asidsted by such grid­iron greats as Andy PUney, WaOy Fimkait. Fred Handy. Andy PapEs. Sed CHeasM. BO! Stdakciaper, and AI Cahcr.

On Oct. 6, the Notre Dame Club of Detroit gave a dinner at the University Club congratulating Harry Kelly on his election as president of the national Notre Dame alumni. The occasion was made more auspidous by the presence of Rev. Hnfh O'DonneD, preddent of the University. Over 60 members lent willing ears to Harry who told of his first session in the president's chair. Many of us who have heretofore given little thought to the University's problems, particularly those in the field of finance, were brought up to date, and all were convinced that Harry intended to set up an administration which would clearly bring before the entire alumni body, both the problem and a program for its happy solution. 

Father CDonncU took the meeting over from there with an excellent dissertation on the ideol­ogies pre\'alent in many schools—ideologies which leave God out of its concept of the source from whidi sudt ideals as Freedom and Liberty eman­ate. H e Club was particularly grateful to Father O'Donnell for honoring our gathering with his presence in view of the difficulties he encountered in getting to Detroit—planes were grounded, train schedules scrambled, but Gil Sdiaefer drove to Toledo and finally brought the bad-weather odys­aey to a happy end. 
Not omtent with having successfully staged the dinner, as THE function for October, oar inde­fatigable Biil^ Lee planned another October soiree for the nls^t of the twentieth. Chairmanned by Howard Beccfainnr, the Club met 120 strong at the Whittier Hotel. Dinner preceded the announc­ing of the fortunate few who won prizes as the result of the Club's annual dra^ring—conducted to aid in the establishment of a scholarship at Notre Dame for some deserving student from the Detroit area. 

In conjunction with these matters interesting phenomena always occur. Ours was no exception. That we were successful in achieving our objective is attributable to Hovi^rd Beediinor who devoted the time and the energy that was required in such abundance as to discourage others less hardy. 
On Nov. 15, the Club sponsored a football spe­dal to Evanston for the Northwestern game. One hundred club members and their friends made the trip. Ihe Club also completed arrangements for a football spedal to the Southern Cal game at Notre Dame. Four hundred reservations are on hand. 
The annual election of oncers will be on Mon­day, Nov. 24. Frank Lcaliy, our esteemed coadi (\nn, lose or draw) is to be the piece de redst­ance at the luncheon meeting of the Monday Morning Quarterbacks Club, conducted in Detrcut by the "Detroit Hmes." Hint evening he will be the guest of the Notre Dame Club—and how the questions will fiy! It's a toss-up which of the sessions will be the more arduous. Any doubts as to which will be the more partisan ?

The club at its regular dinner meeting at the Kemper Lane Hotel on Nov. 11, had as its guest speaker Larry Goetz, the National League umpire who was behind the plate in the critical fourth game of the last World Series. The largest crowd of the year gave Larry a big hand after he settled once and for all the question of what happened when Owen dropped that third strike. Also present as guest of the dub was Babe Ganzel, of Jackson­ville, Fla., the former manager of the Minneapolis Millers.

Glad to report to the alumni that one of our most confirmed bachelors. Torn Oannlnghaai in the 1301st Reception Center, U. S. Army, New Cumberland Post, married the former IGss Jane £ . Davty, last month. TCMO and the newest Notre Dame bride in this locality are living in New Cumberland for the time being, pending Tom's posdble rdease from the Army. 
We are sorry to r^iort that due to the pressure of business Sam Reed had to relinquish his job of secretary of the Harrisburg Club which he had so capably ^filled. However, we think we have a very worthy pinch-hitter in Tom Cazfagno, the head man of the Cannon Shoe Company in Mc-Sherrystown, Pa. Tom has always been Notre Dame's man of the 'hour in lower Pennsylvania, and very active in his locality. It Is interesting to note also that Tom is the president of the Central Pennsylvania Shoe and liCather Assoda­tion, and he had patented several improvements for the manufacture of shoes. 
Was just informed by Joe FarrcU that our old friend and former president. Dr. Joe Rafter, is well on the road to recovery. He had a siege of 111 luck, first losing dothing, books, and personal goods in a fire in his office in Scranton, then an acddent which put him in the hospital for awhile, and to top it all off had to undergo serious opera­tions in Philadelphia. 
Bah Graham, '26, of York, Pa., who was strick­en with infantile paralysis, is remarkably recov­ered. We hear that he was at the Navy game, and

In spite of unfavorable weather, nearly 1.300 merrymakers crowded the Grand Ballroom of the Hotel Commodore Oct. 31 for the eve of the 28th Army-Notre Dame game, for the Fourth Annual Reunion and Rally sponsored by the Notre Dame Club of New York. 
From the opening shot fired by President War­ren Fogel, '30. until the last musical notes played by Francis B. Walther's, '25. orchestra, the pro­gram moved with smoothness and swiftness sur­passing any similar effort ever undertaken by the local alumni. 
The Reunion and Rally Committee, headed by Richard L. Donoghne, '30, general chairman and Edward Beckman, '16, co^diairman in charge of arrangements, has every reason to feel that all the long hours of preparation were not in vain and that the untiring efforts of the combined com­mittees were directly responsible for the success of this party, which annually, is attracting national attention. 
Bill Cunningham, popular sports columnist of the Boston "Herald" and long a favorite with all Notre Dame men. was a brilliant toastmaster. He was ably assisted in his exacting duties by JadE Lavelle. '28, who is rapidly gaining far reaching fame as one of the most popular after-dinner story-tellers in the athletic field. 
Rev. John J. Cavanaogh, C.S.C., vice-president and oflicial representative of the Univer^ty, spoke briefly on the splendid relations between the United States Military Academy and the Univer­sity of Notre Dame and brought greetings from school to all those present. 
Frank Leahy. '31, inspiring coach of the current "Fighting Irish," was an early arrivaL His force­ful talk was evidence that Frank is as effective on the speaker's platform as is his squad on the field. Others who addressed the merrymakers were: Hon. Frank Walker, '09, postmaster general of the United SUtes: Grantland Bice, Greg Sice, '39: Elmer Layden, '25, now commisaoner of professional football: Arch Ward. '21; Hon. James

On Nov. 8, the club, in conjunction with Pete Qain , '32 of Bkxmtfield, N. J. and the New Jersey Club, ran a spedal train to the Navy-Notre Dame game in Baltimore. Approximatdy 400 stalwart fans rode the special trun via the Penn B^lroad. and it was one of the best trips ever run by anyone, anywhere, and with of coarse. Notre Dame coming out on the long end of the score, all had a perfect day. Your secretary now appreciates the headaches at the University ath­letic offices: distributing the limited ntunber of Navy tickets (our allotment vras 250) to well over 2,000 would-be-applicants was really some­thing.

Shades of the campus days—the gymnasium on Army day —no radio—the large chart suspended from the balcony—bu^ runners carry the reports from the apparatus room—the agile ball bouncing about on the large green field—the skips and jumps of the continuity—the expressions on the boys faces —hope and faith felt as the boys watch the prog­gress of the game goes with us or against us— the wild cheer of success—the groan of failure-^ the scramble to the dining hall—the rehash of the game in the rooms—quiet and sleep. 
The present alumni straggling in from different pursuits—easy chairs, cigars and cool drinks— tactical situations discussed—a nod of the head— a groan of despair—the cheer song—the procession to the table—^talk—a hand clasp and farewell. 
Alfred J. Regan, '95, was the dean of those present and all seemed pleased w^ith the results of the mud bath; if it were the Na\'y in the water they might have sunk us was the general conclusion.

Deaths 
Word came to the office of the death on Jaly 28. of Rer. Raphael Artlian O^B., BLA., '28, from Belmont, N. C. 
One of Notre Dame's most ardent supiiorters, Ckailea M. Bryan, '97, president of the Alumni '• Association in 1913-14, died of a heart attack Oct. 29, as he sat telldng Notre Dame fooibaTi with a friend. A deep student of the game, he was sayins that the secret of football vas not in the backfield, but the tackles; tha^ he sudL was the strength of the famous Notre Dame teams. Just then he was stricken with a heart attack and died almost instantly: 
Charles Bryan, whose legal career made lum one of Memphis' most vivid and colorful person­alities, was equally outstanding as a scholar, a raconteur, an orator, and a business man. His life was as dramatic He enioyed nothing joote than a good battle. esx>ccially if it were a battle of wits. For 40 years he was one of the most prominent figures in Memphis and one of the most colorful attorneys in the courts of the state. 
His gift of oratory was often called upon in the interest of civic enterprises, such as the Liberty Bond carop^gn. He was recently the prin­cipal speaker at the Memphis Navy Day celebra­tion. 
Mr. Bryan was one of the leaiUng figures in the Shelby County. Tenn.. political organization, serving as its legal "trouble-shooter." As a busi­ness man, he was the principal owner of the National Burial Insurance Co., Memphis, and president of the National Funeral Home of Memphis. He was also the owner of considerable real estate in Memphis. 
Mr. Bryan was an omniverous reader, whose favorite subjects were English and French his­torical biographies. He was more interested in men and what caused events, than in the events themselves. He also wrote poetry, for his own enjoyment, which he never published, bot stored in his desk. The few friends who had read it,' said much of it is worthy of pnblicaUon. 
Mr. Bryan was bom in Memphis and educated at Christian Brothers College. He was graduated from the law school of the University of Virgixua following his graduation from Notre Dame. His first job was as a newspaper rejKirter, but a year, later he entered the practice of law. 
Mr. Bryan was an enthusiastic member of the Notre Dame Club of Memphis, and was at one time president of the organization. He managed to see at least one Notre Dame game «bch year, and at the time of his death was planning to fly to South Bend for the Notre Dame-Southern Csli­fomia game. 
Death came suddenly to Marion S. Oberting* a student in 1898, in his home in Greendal^ Ind., on Sept. 18. Mr. Obertlng attended both S t Mary's College, now Dayton Univernty. and Notre Dame. For several years he was associated in the brew­ery business with his father, and later became a member of the Big Four Railroad organization. He was also owner of the Lawrenceburg Ice and Coal Co.. until his retirement in 1934. 
Angus McDonald, '00, Dies 

*"The spot where my youthful years were passed as in a dream can never be forgotten. 'Die mem­•ory of those days is a part of me. In looldng back over that period of cloud and simshine, the little sorrows, disappointments, and troubles, now seem far sweeter than many of the joys I have since e^'perienced; and I always regard Notre Dame with that feeling of love one has for home, and for those who made it home, a feeling whidi can never be expressed nor forgotten... .'* 
Ihus did Angus D. McDonald, of the class of 1900, ^>eak to the class of 1931 in his Commence' ment address. 
And thus did he unknowingly write the perfect preface for his obituary in the alumni magazine of his University. 
For thous^ as president of the Southern Padfie Company he directed the activities of 100 snbod­iary eompanies, Angns McDonald always had time to express his love for Notre Dame; as a.lay trustee of the University, he returned often to the campus to spve freely to his Alma Mater out of his vast store of czpericnee and knowledge. 
He gave his time and services just as entfaos­xastically as he did back in 1898 and 1899 when he was a brilliant qnartoback on the Notre Dame fcotball team, just as willingly as he £ d during the four years be played on the beweball team, two of them as captain. 
His God. ndigion and Church, as well as his University, received freely of his loyalty, en­thusiasm and ability, and in 1931 Fbpe Fins XI bestowed on him Ibiit^thood in the Soverdgn HItitary Order of Malta. The same year, when he delivered the Commencement address. Notre Dame awarded him the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws. 
It is for these reasons that it can be written that in the death of Angus McDonald Notre Dame has losti not only one of her alumni most dis­tinguished in business, hot. first, an alumnus idm gave to the sdiool the most he had to give, self­sacrifiring devotion. 
Aiw«s D. Md>«uU 

Mr. McDonald £ed in San Frandsco on Nov. 
15. the day of the epic football battle with North­western. He had undergone an operation on Nov. 11. 
Representing the University at the funeral was Rev. John J. Cavanan^, C.S.C., vice-president of the University. Most Rev. John F. 0*Hara, C.S.C., DJ>.. military delegate was also present. 
Angus Daniel McDonald was bom in Oakland. Calif.. April 14, 1878, son of Angus and Belle (McEadiem) McDonald. His father, vdio was a native of Prinee Edward Island, Canada, was mn engines on the Southern Pacific railroad for many years. 
Mr. McDcmald's boyhood was qpent in Houston, Texas. After'four years at the University, he returned to Houston, and, as a clerk In the ac­counting d^wrtment of the Southern Padfie lines, fwnb«flrwd Upon the career iriudi was to give him a high place in the traaqportation Industry. He ^wnt three years as a derk in Houston and in 1904 was transferred to the Southern Padfie's ofr fiees in San fVandseo, iHwre he served for three years in. a sisBilar capacity. 
In 1907 be was appointed auditor of the Los Angeles Pacific Co^ a subsidiary of the Southern Pacific, in Los Angeles, and in 1908 he became auditor of the Padfie Electric Ck>., another sub­sidiary, in the same city. Here he remained until 1910 vrhen be was appointed auditor of the entire Southern Pacific ^stem, with headquarters in' San Francisco, ^ 
Three years later (March, 1913) he vras trans­ferred to New York City as deputy controller of the Southern Padfic Co., and in the following month was elected vice-president and controller. The Southern Pacific Ck>mpany is made up of more than 100 corporations, including real estate. terminal, mining, oil, electric, steamship and rail­road companies, and, as head of the accounting department of tlus -vast organization, he was able to acquire an intimate knowledge of the workings of all its constituent parts. 
So well did he make use of his opportunity that in 1925 he was elected a director and vice-chairman of the company. A year later he was made president of the Southern Pacific Lines in Texas and liouisiana, a promotion which gave him control and supervision of no less than 10 rail­roads in the territory between New Orleans and EI Paso, Texas, constituting one of the principal units of the Southern Pacific System. In 1932 he was advanced to the presidency of the Southern Pacific Company. In the World War he was the first treasurer of the United States railroad ad­ministration accounting forces. 
Mr. McDonald held a unique position among railroad executives in that he was a product of the accounting department instead of the operating brandi from which roost transportation managers come. He was a man of unusual intellectual vigor and of splendid constitution, the latter a result of his college atiiletics from which he drew invalu­able lessons in self-control, self-reliance, discipline and sportsmanship, qualities that contributed much 
•to his success in life. 
Mr. McDonald was a director of the Guaranty Trust Company of New York, and a member of the Canadian Society of New York, the Metro­politan, .New York Athletic, and Lawyers Clubs, New York; St. Andrew's Golf Club, Westchester County, N. Y.; Traffic Club of New York, and the Congres^onal Country Club, Washington, D. C. He was married in Oakland, Calif., Aug. 31, 1905, to Mary Josephine, daughter of Joseph McDonald, who survives him. 
Byrne M. Daly, Jackson, Mich., a Notre Dame student in 1900-04, died on Oct. 29. A fervent Catholic, Mr, Daly was especially devoted to the annual Lay Retreats at Notre Dame, and he was the leader of a local movement which has brought a large and jncreadng number of Jackson retreat-ants to the campus each summer. 
Andrew W. Yoonr. '16, of Wausan. Wis., died in November after a long illness, according to word from Father Hugh O'Donnell, president, who 
•was a classmate and hallmate (St, Joe Hall) of Mr. Young. Surviving him are his wife and three ehildren. 
The "Alumnus" of last month carried the bare announcement of the death, on Sept 19, of an eminent authority on canon law. Rev. Stanislaus Woywood, '23, OSM., 61 years old. Father Woy­wood had five years of graduate work at Rome in canon law and moral theology and took his LL-B. in ci«l law at Notre Dame. He was the author of an English translation of much of the code of canon law and of a two-volume conjmentary on the code. He was the editor of "St. Anthony's Almanac" and assoriate editor of the American edition of the "Friar" series, and a contributor to the "Catholic Encyclopedia." 
Bom In dottstadt. East Prussia, Germany, in 1880, of Polish ancestry. Father Woywood came to the United States in 1897 and entered the Franiuscan order two years later. He also was noted as a professor of canon law and Utnr8y> Until reccntiy he was rector of Holy Name College in Washington, D.C. 
Oliver P. Helland, '39, Wisconsin Dells, Wis., one of the most popular and talented students of his time at Notre Dame, was killed in an air crash in Florida on Nov. 3. A naval aviation cadet, Ollie was stationed at Miami. He would have received his. commission as a flyer on the day following his death. 
The funeral was in Wisconsin Dells on Nov. 7, with Dick Lncfce, '39, a classmate and close friend, as one of the pallbearers. The local American Legion post assisted in the ceremonies. 
Ollie was particularly known at Notre Dame as an outstanding boxer in the Bengal Bouts and as a caricaturist of unusually fine ability. His caricatures were a feature of the 1939 "Dome." 
Surviving Ollie besides his parents are two sis-tors and two brothers. One brother, Hans, is a Junior at Notre Dame. 
Father Hugh O'Donnell, president, offered a requiem Mass for Ollie in Sacred Heart Church. Members of the local Naval R.O.T.O. unit assisted. 
Still another tragic loss in the current defense preparations was suftered on Oct. 24 when Avia­tion Cadet John T. Von Harz, MO, was Idlled in a collision of two Navy training planes near Corpus Christi, Tex. Leaving Crystal I*ake, HI., in May, along with John A. Mclntyre, '40, who was coach at Crystal Lake High school, John took bis pre­liminary flight training at the Glenview, 111., naval a\*iation base and was transferred to Jacksonville, Fla., for advanced work in the air. He began his training at the Texas station last August. 
John's funeral was in Crystal I^ake where bis mother, two sisters and a brother survive him. Father Hugh O'Donnell sang a requiem Mass for him in Sacred Heart Church on Oct. 29, with the local N. R. O. T. C. assisting. 
The "Alumnus" extends sincere sympathy to Manrice Lee, *33, upon the death of his mother; Rev. Charles F. Kamasievricz, '34, upon the death of his mother; Rev. F. J. Ballinger upon the death of his father; Joseph. Hnber, '41, upon the death of his mother; Al Del Zoppo, '41. upon the death of his mother; and James Hnriey, ex. '44, upon the death of his sister.

All class members who desire an attractive Notre Dame seal for the 'windshield of their car may obtain one free by dropping a card to the class secretary. In doing so, send along a little news. 
-Judging from the enthusiasm shown and re* ports of the football schedule for next fall (five games played at Notre Dame) there will surely be many of our class-mates who will have reunions at the week-end games. Details of this feature of our next year's reunion are being worked out. 
A self-addressed envelope •nil! shortiy be sent to all class members so that they may report at any time on events that would be interesting to other members of the class. 
Judging from reports received to date, our reunion next June wilt be one of the largest any class has ever staged.

Walter De Gree is the architect who designed the new six-room houses on three levels which the OetnMt Cooke Coastmction Company is selling for $3,500. with a money-hack guarantee. Walter en­tered tlie company via Paris Beaux-Arts, the lum­ber business in Detroit and Cleveland, a private 
- architectural practice in Washington, and from 193S to 1940. the "housing school" of'Planner Eex­ford ^igwell, where he was an architect and plan-nine coordinator for the Resettlement Administra­tion (now the Farm Security Administration). Today Walter is vice-president of the Cooke Co. 
From Leo Ward: 
I had occasion to phone Notre Dame a few weeks ago and-talked to the Rer. James Conner-tan. 0,8.0.. registrar. Father Connerton recalled tiiat approximately a year ago I had asked him' to adviae me of the numlier of our class who had taken religions orders, either secular or in the Oansrcsation of Holy Cross. I asked him when the aeeoont yras coming since it appeared that several iasoes of tlie "Alumnus" had mentioned that same member of our class is now a Reverend or a Very Reverend. His answer was very mpt: he stated that I undoubtedly would receive the article \oag before I would find time to set back to Notre Dame. Apparently he was chiding me on my absence of more than 20 years from the campus. 
The news relating to Notre Dame which h^s come to my attention as usual is not all with reference to the class of 1920. However, we will claim it as 1920 news since it has at least been called to the attention of the secretary of the class of 1920. 
This morning's Los Angeles '"limes" carries two articles of interest to Notre Dame. One is the death of Angus McDonald, president of the South-em Pacific Railway. He was a member of the Xiay Board of Trustees and undoubtedly the "Alumnus" will carry more detailed news of his relationship and accomplishments as they affect Notre Dame. 
Another item is the election to the Board of Lay Trustees of Terence B. Cosgrove, class of 1904. The "Alumnus" will also carry a m'ore detailed announcement of the enlargement of the Board of Lay. Trustees and the election to the board of Mr. Cosgrove who is a resident of Los Angeles and has been a credit to the school by reason of his many accomplishments. 
During the past summer I had occasion to see Ray Miller. He dropped in the office and talked to Joseph Scott. Walter Miller, his brother, was a member of our class, and I understand Walter is doing all right as the representative of the class of 1920 and ambassador without portfolio of the thriving metropolis of Defiance, Ohio. Ray Miller advises also that Johnny Powers is now working for the government. It seems that all the Demo­crats who ever attended Notre Dame have govern­ment positions. 
Dean McCarthy of the College of Commerce was here in Los Angeles during the past month, ad­dressing a section of the Outdoor Advertising Association, which has just established a founda­tion at Notre Dame. During that time he had occasion to see Charlie Cnsack of the Thomas J. Cusack Company, which company was an import­ant cog in the formation of the General Outdoor Advertising Co. As a result of the Cusacks (Frank and the late Thomas J., Jr. and Charlie, all of whom were on the campus between 1916 and 1920), severing their relationship with the com­pany, another Notre Dame alumnus of the Class of .1920, Alden J. Casick, who had formerly been with the Cusack Company, carried on for Notre Dame with the General Outdoor Advertising-I understand that Alden Cusick has continued his association with General Outdoor Advertising. 
Emmett Lcnihan, of the firm of Lenihan and Ivers of Seattle, Wash., representing the North­-westem Brewers Association, apparently was suo cessful in his representation of that organization in their fight between the teamsters union and the soft drink and cereal workers union. The Amer­ican Federation of Labor, meeting in Seattle re­cently, expelled the soft drink and cereal workers union from membership in the A. F. of L. as a result of a jurisdictional fight existing for a number of years between the hrewers of that com­munity, growing out of their contention for rep­
resentation of the Northwest Brewers. 
Gene Kennedy returned from the Middle West. He was on the campus for Commencement and reported fleeing a great number of our class and other classes who were around the campus during those years. 
CHuries Mclver, who was in our class but took himself across the lake with such worthies as Leo 
L. Wmxd, Leo R. Ward, Art Hop«, Jim Conncrton, Tom ToUn. BUI Deheny and a host of others who later were ordained, is seen here in Los Angeles from time to time. I recently saw Ed Ashe who is 
The Notre Dame Alumnus 
now with the McDonald Construction. CompauTk building airplane factories. 
Ted Sbeahan, who w ^ in the Class of 1920 but left Notre Dame for Stanford, has returned to Los Angeles where he is practicing law. Jim McCahe^ who is in Los Angeles with the Illinois Central Railway, returned to Indiana for a few weeks' holi­day. He saw the Northwestern same at Evanston And expects to return with a new automobile, one of Henry Ford's best. 
While Frank Leahy was here for Howard Jones' funeral we-had a little'meeting. The three Walak brothers, Adam* now coaching at Bowdoin, Chili« now assistant coach of the Chicago Cardinals, and Paul, the baby of the family, got together. Earl Walsh (no relation to the other family) has been on the Coast several times scouting St. Mary's for Jim Crowley. Ed McMahon and Joe Sattner keep me supplied with their copies of South Bend papers and in that way I am able to check up on the correspondence I have received from the sev­eral players from this part of the country who are on the squad, notably Bob Maddoek and Bob V/ebb. 
Incidentally, I have seen no mention in the "Alumnus" of the fact that John Rider is with the Fred Allen show and is reported to be staging the contest whereby the representatives of the various colleges are selected for an appearance on the Fred Allen broacast. (Ed's note: See October, 1941, "Alumnus," Mr. Ward.) 
I hear that Judge Carberry (the younger and not the one who is helping Crowley at Fordham) and Louis Berardi have been traveling in the East and have managed to see Notre Dame play several games. 
Of course, during football season we hear that representatives of the coaching staff, such as Bill Cemey, get out to this part of the country to check up on U.S.C. and Stanford. I saw Bill Cemey and Larry Moore at the U.S.C-Stanford game working with Bill and Frank Hess, making notes as to U. S. C's ability. Ben Alexander checked into the press box also.

Garvin Fransioli, '34. writes; 
"Just ran across in the Memphis Club news, a man you might have known, a 'V. Fianscen.' This is Vondel R. Fransen. ex. '21. whose histoiy is interesting in itself. He was bom in Nicarastia. his father was Belgian, and his mother Spanish, so when he was about six years old. they sent him up to the States to go to school. He and his brother attended grade school at Notre Dame, back in the days of the 'minims.' while his sister was going to St. Mary's across the way. 
"He went to high school in Belgium, and to college at Tulane in New Orleans. He is with the Fbn-Atlantic Steamship Co., living in Memphis now with his new bride whom he just brought back from New Orleans. He's a Notre Dame man from 'way back."

From Jahn Hmiley: 

Your secretary hasn't received a single line from the class so be had to take a trip down to New York to stir up some '25 news. 
I met Bill Bell in front of Paddy's Clam House. He introduced me to Mn. Bell. Bill was married this ^ring. 
At the Aimy-Notre Dame rally at the Commo­dore, I saw many of' our contemporaries. Jakn Bartley is the same smiling John. John's wife was at the same table with the Honorable Vincent and Mrs. HacrinctoB of our class; Dr. Geny Hayes. ' '26. and Mr. and Mrs. Hariy Flannery. '24. Harry had recently returned from Berlin. He looks pretty much the same as the old school days. 
Jim Araslnns was there greeting all the boys. Bag* Wahkets orchestra famished the music for the occasion so with Elaer Layden on the pro­gram and Honorable Vincent Harrington, the class of '25 was very well represented. For years I've wanted to attend one of these NJ>.-Army affairs and I must say that the New York Club is to be 
' congratulated for its efforts in arranging a real party. 
Bags WalllMr has two children and as Bugs says —Jim Ctvwley has swung them Fordham's way, end Bugs is worried about getting his boy to think about going "Back to Indiana" for his college days. 
After that great battle in the "sea of mud" your correspondent attended the furniture market in Chicago during the following week. PanI BOIB-weber was the only classmate I saw. Paul never looks a day older. He saw the Indiana game and plans on seeing the Southern California game. Called Jade Scallan on the phone. Jack has been 
' very busy, but. like Bill Bdl, promised to get some Chicago news to me. If Bill gives me the dope on the East and Jack the Middle West, all we want is a dark horse from the Far West. 
Let's have a word from the dark. horses thron^out the eoontry.. 
Martia Kccsan. ex. '25, has been appointed county superintendent in charge of the national youth administration work in Peoria Coonty, lU. Before taking employment with NYA, Martin was for more than dght years, supervising pirole officer at the Fontiae brandi of the Illinois peni­
- tentiary system. He is an active member of the American Prison Congress and the American Parole Association. 
Included in the sx-man display of ceranucs, water colors; and seulptnre in the WIghtman Art Galleries at the University during the second week of November was a water color exhibit by Saaad U«aiey. ex. '25, of wUeh Frank Montana, an instructor in architeetare at the Univeraty, offers the -' following critidsmr "Mr. Homsesr's water colors show a great deal of experimentation in tedmiqae aecordins to sobject and time of day. In some cases he adiieves the delicacy and power of the Japanese paintings with his combination ot wet and dry bmdi, dry brush being used for his accents and details. His careful use of pure transparent and earth colors give bis water colors a brilliancy not achieved by many. 
'"Bx handling ot his larger sketches is amilar to that of the water colorist*. Whistier and Sar­gent. The Salphnr Pile and the Blue Dory are OQtatan£ng exhibits." 
Samad Honucy, his -wife. Victorine duFont Homscy and Theodore Fletcher as associate are combining; their architectural talents in a small Wilmington, Delaware, office and a large home studio. With tiieir simplified office and studio arrangements they have turned out approximately 
s. million dollars worth of building in the last year. 
After working as an architect in the office of several large Eastern construction companies, Sam. with another chap, won a competition for a firs station in Texas and went down to build it-A job as a superintendent opened up down there, and he gained valuable expenence in putting up B school, a water works, and an office building. Then back to Boston where he detailed the north transept of Washington Cathedral. He had mar­ried Victorine duPont. With the collapse of work in 1931 they ^>ent a year and a half studying contemporary work in Europe and Mexico, but soon returned to this country and settled in Wil­mington with the urge to develop some new ideas in architecture. Today there are seven active projects in the office of these three architects who have designed houses, nursery schools, a hospital, museum, theatre, industrial plant, beach clubs, farm buildings, restoration of historic monuments, and a whole residential commimity.

From Loa BacUey: 

By the time these notes are in print, no doubt. Season's Greetings will be in order. I hope your fourteenth Christmas since graduation will be a very happy one. When you make your New Year's resolutions, please remember your class secretary has to make eight deadlines in 1942 for this 1928 column. If you want to keep the column going, you will have to resolve to cooperate better than some of you have done in the past, Pete Gallagher wrote this month to 19 fellows in Pennsylvania for news and he received only three replies. Let's give the guest ^^Titers the fine cooperation they deserve. 
I am going to ask KusseU lUley to give us a report on the New Jersey gang for the next issue and Tom CoUins for an account of what is going on in '28 circles in Massachusetts. 
Didc Hinckdiffe and his wife were in Washing­ton after the Navy game. Dick hasn't changed a bit in all these years. "He has two children now and is with the St. Anthony Guild in Paterson, 
N. J. 
llianks to Bill Cronin's efficient air-mail special delivery service and to the excellent work of our two guest writers, Pete Ganagfwr and John Rob­inson, and to those who responded to their re­quests for news, we meet the deadline in fine style. 
Pete GaUagiier writes from 934 Center St., Freeland, Pa., as follows: "The first reply I re­ceived was from Dare Solomon, who resides at 219 W. ffigh Street, Ebensburg, Pa. Dave has the same trouble I have. We never meet any men from our class. Besides this both of us have been approached by one of your guest writers a short time ago, so what news we have is very apt to overlap what already has been printed. Bad Callagy wrote to Dave and John Fontana wrote to me." 
"FVom Bjensburgh, Pa., Dave Solomon writes: "Th e nearest man to me is in Pittsburgh, 80 ndles west. Dr. Frank Hegarty is now Captain F. 
A. Hegorty and is stationed at Camp Meade. Al Doyle, M.D., is Captain Al and is stationed at Indiantown Gap. Marcos FarreO, I understand, is happily married and practicing medicine some­where in West Vir^nia. Hegarty. Farrel, WA Wehs, and I all interned at Mercy Hospital in PiUsburgh way back in 1932-33. Each of us had graduated from a different medical school. I haven't heard from the wandering Dick W^ s since then.' 
" 'Mike Ricks spent a couple of weeks with us, in company with Mrs. Ricks. That was otir first meeting since 1928. Mike has three fine boys. He recently built himself a new home and was taken into Lafayette's finest law firm as junior partner, so you see Mike has done something of which old Notre Dame may well be proud.' 
" 'I am doing all right in Ebensburg—married— three children to date—^Michael, Paul, and Mary. ­We have open house and an unlocked door to any '28 men passing through this old town.* 
"John McLtmghlin writes from Indiana, Fa.: 

" 'Qnentin Wildman is located here in Indiana, Pa.; he has been employed by the Rochester and Pittsburgh Coal Company for a number of years, is married, and has two children.' 
•' 'I was employed by the Pennsylvania Depart-men of Highways shortly after graduation and have been with them since, in the Bifi^t of Way Unit. I have been transferred twice, but have been in Indiana since 1931. Incidentally, I was married in that year, and have two children, a boy and a girl. Everything O.K., you see.' 
"J. Charles Short sent this news special de­livers' : 
" 'After I left Notre Dame, I worked for one year with my father in building construction. I then entered DuQuesne Univer^ty Law School and in due course was graduated and admitted to the Bar. During several months of 1934 and 1935, I was associated with the Home Owners liOan Corp­oration, at Johnstown, Pa., as associate counsel and assistant district counsel. Since July, 1937, I have been at Harrisburg, Pa., where I am now chief counsel for the Pennsylvania Labor Hela­tions Board. I was married at Beading, Fa,, in 1939, to Mary Ann Grant. We have one child, John Charles, Jr., who is 20 months old. My wife and I were at Notre Dame in June, 1939, when my brother Walter was graduated. I attended the meetings of the Notre Dame Club of Harrisburg, but I am the only member of our class in the club.* 
"That is the grand total of all I could collect except some additional information about a fdlow townsman, Maarice McBfenanin. He is married and has one duld. He lives in New York City and works for the Walgreen Drug Co. 
"I am curious to learn about the wandering Dick Wefas. My letter was returned, stamped, 'whereabouts unknown.' 
"I am still where I was when I wrote to Jstut Fontana, head of the English d^artment in the Freeland High schooL Married.... two boys." 
Fete also s^it the following fine report on the New York gang from Jade Lavelle, who, as yon know, is director of athletics with the CsthoUe Youth Organization of the archdiocese of New York. 
"Bill (IHirk) KeHy has just recovered from a' minor oi>eration and has resumed his duties at Seward Park Hi ^ school. On a recent trip to Pittsburgh, I had the pleasure of seeing our frieid Fritz Wilson,, the old first sacker, and had ^nner with him and his lovely wife that evening. On the way home. I met Pinky Martin in the Pitts­burgh station. Pinky is now in the automobile business. 
"Getting back to New York we had quite a 

gaUwring of oar class at the reunion and rally prior to the Army game. Ibary Conley put in his nsnal, annual appearance and was his old self, in conqpany with two specially selected members of '30—Patsy- Hastings and TiBOtliy (no Benedict) ' TssMij. They held forth for hours at a time. ChiU Walsh, the old end was present with his boss, Jimmy Conzelman of the Chicago Cardinals. 
Also, Bcmie Garfccr, Joe Friel, Lany CuUincy, and Mrs., Jack Rcilly, the former sprinter and relay man and Pat Canny, who seems to be everywhere.** 
Our second guest writer of the month, John BaMnson, writes from Cheshire, Conn., as follows: 
"My old friend Paul Wcndland was the first to reply to my letter via air malt Paul has been married for almost a x years. He is buyer and merchandise manager for the ladies ready-to-wear department of the H. G. Wendland and Co. Paul tells me that his music is a thing of the past, althtms^ he occa^onally picks up his saxaphone and tries a few tunes. I know that the men of the class of '28 will remember how he entertained them nightly with Denny's orchestra at the La Salle Hotel. 
"Paul claims be sees Jerry Bigge once in a while and that he is a proud father. I wrote to Jerry, but had no reply. Paul liv^ in Bay CSty, Midi. Jerry Bigge lives in Muskegon, Mich. 
"I see John CoUinan qtiite often when I visit Bridgeport. He is a very successful lawyer and was ^pointed to the Common Pleas Coiut of Connectxeut a few months ago by the governor. John is the youngest appointee in the history of the state. In 1931, he completed his law course at Yale University. One of his law school classmates was E. Bolan Bmke, from New Orleans. Six months after graduation from Yale, John was appcnnted assistant corporation counsel of the city of Bridg^wrt, rerving in this office until 1934. In January, of 1937, he was appointed as­sistant United States attorney for Connecticut. In July of that year he was appointed prosecuting attorn^ of the city of Bridgeport, serving until July, 1941, when he was appointed to the Common Fleas Brach. 
"Harrid Rappel, my old roommate. Is a pros­perous burinessman in Cleveland. I visited him not long ago and enjoyed a delightful evening witib ^15 charming family. Harold is the proud father of two daughters. He is assistant secretary and insurance manager of the United States Truck Lines, Inc., of Delaware; 1438 Midland Bldg., Cleveland. Harold tells me he sees Martin Rtni occasicmally and would like to hear from Hal H«dtm and Vic Zimmerman.

Captain Tom Noon sent us a letter from Marine Aircraft Group Eleven, Turner Field, Quatitico, Va., in which he says: "2nd Lieut. Paul Lenihan, '39. is down here now at the same address. I understand from the Chaplin that there are quite a few N. D. men on the Post, but as my duUes keep me away from Quantico pretty much of the time, I haven't gone 'roundin* 'em up.' However, I intend doing that very shortly and we'll have a reunion of our own here on the Post."

One could reach John Telland at the Leon W. La Bonnta Agency of the Penn Mutual Life In­surance Ca, 831 Northwestern Bank Bldg., Minne­apolis, Bfinn., of which Jack is a supervisor, and he might shine where your correspondent does not. so we will let him tell the story in further detail: 
"Gerry McKay is the only other '30 classmate whom I can locate here in Minnesota. Gerry is living in St. Cloud, Minn., and he is worMng in that section for the National Cash Begister Co. As yon may Imow, Mac is president of the Min­nesota-Notre Dame Alumni Club, and he usually drives into Minneapolis on Saturdays to take care of the club's affairs. Mac is just as conscientious and energetic as ever. 
"I have been selling insurance for the past 10 years, life, casualty and fire insurance, witli special emphasis on the life insurance pliase of it. I am going to enroll next week at the Uni­versity of Minnesota in a course of a week's duration to get a few new selling ideas and angles. 
"If the Priorities Committees do not clamp down too iiard on building materials, my wife and I expect to be in our new home by Christmas. Vfe will have the welcome mat out for you, a^ well as for others of the class of '30, who may be up this way in the futttre. In the meantime, keep up the good work. Dick, for 1 know that all appreciate and thank you for your splendid column." 
Muchas gratias, Senor Jack, and let me tell you it would be a genuine pleasure to pay yoa this visit, and maybe see some Minnesota football. 
Edward J. Dempsey is with one of the sub­sidiary companies of the Union Carbide and Carbon Company, and his work takes him about the country. We talked with Ed at a. recent alumni meeting of the N. D. Club of N. Y.; he is married, setting along fine, and looking exc ^ tionally well. He wanted to be remembered to his friends in the class. He can be reached at 30 East 42nd Street. New York. 
Would you dare us to turn up with the elusive Cassidy after so long a chase, via Washington, Buffalo and points between there? Hopalong Cas­sidy is the name, or Jack Cassidy of the American Laundry Machine Corp I Well, mates, not only did we hear from him via Portland, Maine, we actually saw him at the Army-N.D. game, so let's get down to cases. Says Jack: 
"I did not loiow that Joe Cnllen was still in Mt. Morris, N. Y. until I had been moved over here (115 Bobbins Road, Arlington, Mass.) from Buffalo. Saw Marty Trarera and his very charm­ing wife and daughter quite often, as well as Joe Fay of Medina, N. Y. but lately of New York City, and even more recently of Buffalo. Joe is married and is the proud father of a son. 
"I have missed Frank Ledeiaunn whenever I have been in Utjca, N. Y. but I saw many of the other fellows who have been maldng the N. D.-Hohawk Valley Club roll merrily forward. Ji a Boideaa of New York City was in Plattsburgh. 
N. Y. during his vacation, and I was fortunate in meeting him. Also, add Joe Brandy to the list. I saw him in Ogdensburg, N. Y. where he is the brains and brawn behind the *Voice of Northern New York—New York's northern-most radio sta­tion.' I still don't believe that such a fellow as Judge Con Carey exists in Franklin County, be­cause each time that I have been in Malone, N.Y.. it was the same story. "Yes, everyone knew the judge, but—where was he?' 
"Met Adam Bray in Syracuse, N. Y. one night; he looks fine and said that he is living in Albany; he represents Mead, Johnson Co. in eastern New York and Pennsylvania. I hear that Pat Hastino is the No. 1 Greek in the restaurant business in Clinton, Mass. [Sec Note: I saw Pat at the N. 
Y. Club's affair the night before the Army-NJ). Game, and he looks fit]! am expecting to be on hand for the Army game, and I hope that we may meet pulling potatoes on the 60-yard line after the game." [Sec. Note: we met, but in a rice field instead.] 
What is this, anyway, but echoes of Sophomore Hallll! "Bichards Faces Mighty Task at Goniaga" says the "Washington 'nmes-Herald," and itTs Sam 'Bo' Ridiarda who had this terrific task to face, because Sam is doing some ^wre-tinie coach­ing at Gonzaga High School. Sam is an attomtr with the Federal Government, as wdl as a sue­eessfol eoadi. We law him and U s vo r fin* family after the N. IX-Navy ganci and at«T"4fil his game the foUowins day betweca Goniasa and St. John's Military Academy. Sam's team did a grand job and won. 
Sam sp<dw of seeing Ttm Lick, head eoach of Univeraty of Florida, when that team played Maryland. Sam has great admiration for Tom as an active and.eolorfiil man about the boieh dar­ing the progress of a game. It seems tint Tom swings a mean xoUed-vp game program as he urges his players onward to greater things, and this appeals to Sam very modi. Hsaa M-B8-. was not on the trip. 
Jeny Body is the president of the N. D. Club of Cleveland, hot in tellinc it, we^re stealing his stuff, so here yoa have it from Jerry:

•Hianksgiving Day to Miss Ethel Murphy. [See. Note: Congratulations to Art and EtheL] Art is associated with the Austin Company here in Cleveland. 
"Ed Blatt is with the Canada life Insurance Co., is happily married, and is the fattier of a newly bom baby. [See. Note: We offer oar eon. gratolations to Ed and his wife.] Jim CaBahaa is employed by Sears. Boeboek Co. in the Ftardias­ing Divirion as a lamp buyer. 
"Ghailey Bakr is in the thick of N. D. goings-on at Ids Fischer-Bohr Bestaorant, and it is said that he sees as many N. D. games as Raak Leahy. He took in the nUnds game with Lew Stettler, whom yoa will remember as our vale­dictorian. Lew is not in Cleveland now. so I don't see much of him. 
"Al faipnif has not called me to go to a game at Notre Dame, Ind. with him this UO. Al travels out of Clevelaal so I do not see him too mod . althaaib wa generally make one pilgrimage each year tosether. Al is. inddentally, the very prood lather of two lovdy girls.

"Sam Bidiards brought his Gonza^a H. S. team up from Washington, D. C. on Nov. 2 to -win over 'Hoolcj;* Smith's Mt. St. Michaels team in a 13-12 thriller. Jack Lavelle, '28, coach of All Hallows, and Hooley's traditional football rival, has been accused at various times since this game for having given 'Bo* the defense to stop Hooley's best scoring plays. I imagine that this situation could be ironed out easily if Hooley, Bo, and lAvelle were to at down at the conference table for, say, about 99 hours! 
"Both Tom Lantry and Tim O'Rourkc were active members of your Keunion and Bally Com­mittee. [Sec. Note: Yes, 'tis true, and Tim did a grand job, but Lantry sabotaged a mailing on Johnny Bams, '31, and a reward is posted for his capture.] Warren Fogel, president of the N. D. Club of N. Y., is now attached to the Air Corps Unit of the War DepL, and be is located at the Wright Aeronautical Plant in Paterson, N. J. Those gray hairs that Warren sports have been caused by his constant worrying about his various chairmen of club activities. [Sec. Note: The New York Club will present Fogel with a streamlined, air-cooled, water repellent *Worry Bird' which will ease his mind of all worry about defiuts, ushers who don't ush, and steaks that seem too tough for the members to digest.] 
**Ray Totten from Pittsburgh was in for the pre-game activities and the game, and he is a lot more philosophical and carefree than one would expect to find him; we •wouldn't know whether he or Larry Cronin is losing the tresses the faster. Larry is back in New York again, and he is associated with the insurance industry as a spe­cial representative. Speaking of sights for sore eyes, and 'long time no see' vre report that Jim Hnlvaney of Auburn, N. Y. paid us a timely and most wdcomed visit, and we were glad to see him again and to know that his wife is recovering from her illness. His daughter is getting toward the school age, besides being the pride of her parents. Bns Redgafe and Tommy Murphy came in from Bridgeport, Conn, for the rain and the game. Dan SnlUvan represents Electrolux, Inc. in Baltimore, -where I saw him during the N.D.-Nav>' game. Dr. Panl 'Bucky' O'Connor and Dr. George Huston went to Baltimore for the Navy game, each looldng fit and fine as they renewed acquaint­ances on the train and in the stadium. 
"Pete Wacks, the Binghamton, N. Y. sleuth of the F.B.I., and Jerry Parker, display manager of American Airlines, Inc., were interested spectators at the Na\*y game. Many of the boys congregnted at the dressing-room door after the game, and a round-robin of hearty greetings took pince." 
Very good, Tim, thanks, as well as ray apologies to you for that false start I sounded recently. I am sure that Ted Twomey and his charming wife v.-ill excuse our error in writing about their mar­riage. We offer our sincere but tardy well-wishes and congratulations to Ted and his wife. Your correspondent also misinformed Al Culver of Chi­cago about Ted's marriage. 
Dave Barry, formerly of Loretto, Pa., attended the Navy game •tdth his brother and told us that he is employed in the production department of the Bethlehem Steel Co. at Sparrows Point, Md. Dave promised to write us a line later on in the year, and we will be very pleased to hear from him. Bemie Brocker is with Bethlehem Steel Co. at the Bethlehem, Pa. offices, speaking of "com­petitor-products," as I must in this instance, and we had the pleasure of seeing him at the Army game. [Sec Note: Your secretary is with their opposition, the American Steel and Wire Co., a 
U. S. Steel Corp. subddiary.] 
Getting down to other serious business before we sign off, I thought that the class might give some consideration to the recent and urgent call by the president of the University -which is en­titled "Do You Bemember— ?" Your secretary would like to hear from the members of the class of 1930 on the subject, when they send in news. I understand that the December issue of the "Alumnus" will be devoted to the plans of the University for next year, and since the class sec­retaries have yet to receive any suggested pro­cedure from the alumni secretary, I -would like some ideas as to the way the class might par­ticipate in the plans for next year. At this moment; we are starting from scratch, so let's have your ideas about the best way to make a concerted effort. Onr reply ought to be a ready one I

With the football season completed more than 400 members of the class in 43 states and five foreign countries join me in congratulating Frank Leahy and his fine staff of assistant coaches on Notre Dame's first undefeated football season in 11 years. 

The Southern Cal week-end saw the greatest influx of class members since our Memorial Day week-end last spring. Tom Cannon, Delaware county prosecutor, was up from Muncie, Ind. Tom is rounding out his third year as prosecutor and ranks as one of the youngest major office holders in ihe state of Indiana. Also present was Tom Monahan, genial broomcom king of central Illi­nois. Tom is being sought as the next Areola, III., mayor after the fine manner in which he put over the homecoming festival there this fall. Others on deck: Ed "Spike" Sullivan, the Mattoon, III., en­gineer who has been a cog in the Carter Oil Com­pany's rise to major importance in the Illinois Oil fields; and Federal District Attorney Joe Decb of Grand Rapids. Blilt Fox, '29, who is in charge of the Fox Deluxe brewery interests in Grand Rapids. Joe has two fine youngsters and is happy to see any of the class having business in the "furniture city." 
Speaking of district attorneys. Frank McGreal, Chicago's gift to the courts was on hand and tliey say the argument that he had with Tim Toomey, the New Yorker, was a s^m. Dr. Joe Hughes, the Columbus surgeon, was a very affable host to some 10 or 12 people at the game. Ben Oakcs, TWA transportation expert, reported that he would be almost a resident down here next month as his line has added South Bend to its list of scheduled stops. George Costello, fresh from a Florida honeymoon, reported that he had visited Bob Balfe in Palm Beach and that Bob was sports editor of the leading daily there. Bob is also ach­ing for an opportunity to return to the campus and renew old friendships. 
Vem Knox, Crystal Lake, III., city attorney, reported that Susan Marie Knox arrived last month and that he hoped to have her entered in the St. Mary's class of 1962. Red Loney, up from Cincinnati is expected to middle aisle it sometime this winter. John Measher, manager of Mankato, Minnesota's largest radio station forfeited m couple of comps to the Minnesota-Wisconsin game to be on hand. Eddie Ujmn, the Chicago. Bail Weld Company executive, made the U. S. C. game lus sixth of the year. Father Boarke Hotaett, up from Kewanee, HI. reported that several members of the class in his vicinity had called on him these past few months. Many more men of the class were present, we know, but one can only see so many in an exciting day. 
' mm Benitz, the New York bachelor, was re­cently discharged from the United States Army wherdn he had served these past six months and hopes to get back in the harness with ..the state o£ New York. Art Bergen, also of New York, is recuperating from an accident of some two months ago wherein be suffered a broken leg.

Jack Saan­dcis found time to make a convention in Balti­more the day prior to the Navy game and con­sequently was able to stay to see our great vic­tory over the Naval Academy. Loa O'Shea also happened to be on hand for that game and related that he is now assistant sales manager for Petro­lagar Laboratories and is making his home on Ridge Road in £vanston. He reported that Dr. Ed O'Melia is LeRoy, New York's leading dentist. Bynm Kearney has forsaken Pennsylvania and is an auditor for the Baltimore branch of Mont­gomery-Ward company. Byron is still single and wished to be remembered to his old friends. Nordy Hoffman made the Navy game and is worldng for the Steel Workers Organizing Committee, Pitts­burgh. He stated that his work takes him to many parts of the country in the rate division. He attended the U. S. G. game also. 
Tom KaBsis holds the record for longest dis­tance traveled to see a game as he left his Cheyenne, Wyo. department store business long enough to witness the Irish victory over the "Wildcats." Tom enjoyed a much milder sport in Dyche stadium this year than 11 years ago as he has succumbed to camera fever. Tony Kego­wicz also came out of hiding to witness that game. Tony is practicing law in Kensington. Bertiaps the busiest man at the U. S. C. week-end was Joe Gavin whose team. Cathedral high of Cleveland completed a very successful season. Joe plans to move into a new home prior to Christmas. A late' report from the rainy Army game week-end via Ed Bbhon, New York detective and our Bronx reporter, stated that J(rfmny Bums, New York Lithograph building manager, was host to some 25 people at dinner following the game and John intimated that be was becoming a benedict soon now that he no longer fears the draft.

From Mike Crawford: 

Hie November issue? When I did not receive a "deadline card" from Dooley I naturally assumed that "that other party" had instituted impeach­ment proceedings against- me. However, I find that the iob is mine for another month at least, but boys, you should see the list of applicants for this job, come reunion time! Only three men from the class have become ineligible to date. Better beat a tune on that typewriter, brother, or it may become a monthly task after June. 
Howard Miller is back in Cleveland, having been discharged from Anchorage. Alaska, by Uncle Sam in mid-September. 
A letter from Tom Boms: 

"Having r^d the 'Alumnus' today I saw your little note to the '32ers about the ten-year re­union next June at Notre Dame. I hope to be present and will be glad to help out insofar as -I can. However, I have no plans ot my own and have heard of none. You may wonder what I have been doing, lliis is my eighth year as a business teacher in a high school near Rochester. I hear occadonally from Comie Hayes of Evan­stott. 111., and Joe Badianan, of Detroit, both of whom seem little dianged, judging from the sound of their letters. Tliere isn't much local news—• Frank Norton is teaching at Niagara U.. Roches­ter brandi. Bill Jones is married and in radio work in dmira, and I almost never see Bed OriUn or VUk Samran." 
A somewhat abridged copy of a letter from Carteret Board of Education prexy Wee Harring­ton: 
"Somewhere along the line I have lost track of everything. One month I pick up the 'Alumnus' and Jiai Igae is in there batting. Next month I ne a Dr. Krran Crawfoid and I tMnk to myself that can't be BOke Crawford—it took him four yeara to learn to wear shoes, he couldn't learn to write since 1932.' My wife and I spent a week­end in Utica with that there Hitxdbcrgcr boy. Everything was fine but someone should U^l him I am a growing boy, and a growing boy needs food. He's selling coal and he must be dmng all right because he had a clean shirt and he has finally given up the sbeepsUn coat with 'Notre Dame' on the back. But he still has the trmeh coat he wore to all the formats. Hitz is the father of a very beautiful Uttie girl. She hxiks Uke her mother. Of course. Frank Denalty was present in body most of the time we were'aroond. He's dishing them across the bar at his own 'Waters' Club.* Despite the fact that he has a nice family of three children, he is as screwy as Walter (Littie Moon) MuUins ever was. The three of US made some tentative plans for the coming reunion but th ^ slip my mind at present. 
And a long letter from Jim Igoe as he cleans up his tenure of office: 
"Congratulations on the new job. I certainly am happy about the whole thing (tee*hee). Here's a bit of dope that came in after my term of office elapsed. 
Letter from Tom McEevitt: 

"Now that a good year has passed since I promised faithfully to write and give you the eastern Notre Dame dope I will get down to business. I know I am probably writing this after your tenure as class secretary is over. 'Better late than never,' however, is an old saw that I keep repeating every time I answer a letter. Yesterday morning I was awakened at the unearthly hour of seven o'clock by Frank 'Do^ BciUey of Boston who was in town on his honeymoon. Me had been married a few days before by Father I^eo (Eng­lish) Ward at the Log Chapel with Jim Carawdy for his best man. I collected Clay Johnson, who is getting his picture in the papers these days as an advisor to Jesse Jones of the R.F.C., and Charlie Farris, '33, who is a trouble shooter for both the Office of Emergency Management and the Office of Production Management. In the course of re­hashing the campus days Doc reported that Fred Eiaemann (the guy who talked me into wearing tights in a Shakespearean play at school) is defin­itely on his way in the theater as a director. We also heard that Joe McCabe is now married and that Ed Rhatigan is now head man in his setup with the State of New York. I had a card from Frank Emeridc from Norfolk, but like a jug-head I failed to answer it yet. I get a lot of glowing reports on John Bentley Ryan from a friend of mine in Los Angeles which makes me wonder what old Center Rush Tom Meade is doing up 
Washington way. I saw Tom Steele going into the Interstate Commerce Building the other day but could not catch him. I also saw Jobn l^nghna in Detroit a few months ago—^he still has no hair and no wife. Joe Langfalin was in town for one unforgettable evening. The pride of Grand Island. N^.,- is now in Ravenna, O.. with the legal staff of the Hercules Powder Ck>mpany. No word of late from Tom Gately." 
An announcement came in from Mr. and Mrs. McKevitt some time in August annonndng the arrival of their first bom, a boy. On the baby subject, an announcement also came in from Flo McGartfiy announcing the arrival of Sally Anne, their second child. 
A letter from Tom Meade: 
"The lack of material under the 1932 heading In the recent 'Alumnus' reminded me that you don't get much copy from this comer of the country. Our alamxd are pretty well scattered out here which makes it pretty hard to keep in touch widi all of them, but the following represents Informa­tion we have on tap. 
"Frank Denney, an old Chicagoan, is with the local office of the J. Walter Thompson Advertis­ing Company, and m y brother. DidE, recently retnmed frcon Sui FVaaeiaco to a desk akng aide Dennay'a.

"Althoui^ it is too early to say definitely, I hope to be able to attend the ten-year reunion of our class next Jane." 
And now back to Igee: 

"An announcement from- Kelly Powers an­nounces the opening of a new service station in Cldcago. 
"A postcard from Didi Kaney. He berates the 

class secretary for not filling the *32 column—Am 
setting th^ card special delivery to you, ICke." 
"Gcarge Baden was in town a couple of months 

ago. He looks fat and prosperous but is sliiditly 
nettled that Ed Bkatigaa didn't invite him to his 
stag party while Mrs. B. was in Chicago visiting 
her family (why, Mrs. R. didn't you know Ed had 
a party ??)" 
lii a note from Gerry linn we learn that he has four sons and is working with the Bendix Aviation Corp., Wayne Division. Plant Engineer­ing department, His home address is 34803 Gleen­wood, Wayne, HiA. 
Bin Jones writes: "I had been in the insorance badness from graduation in '32 until April of this year. However, I had also worked in radio, as chief annmmeer at WSAY in Rochester, N.

In October, I began worldng for the Rochester Products Dividon of General Motors."

From Tithe Wmlmi 

I am almort emshed as I sit down to my trusty Beminston portable and bite my finEemaSIs wait-ins tm inspiration to meet that fast approadins deadline. All entbnaed with my new apptuntmoit last month I sat down and cot off 10 letters ask­ing for news (my secretary needed practice on her dictation anyway) and how many replies have I received to date? None. Serves roe right I suess as I am still trying to find time to sit down and reply to a 1938 alumni questionnaire. 
One shaft of light in a chill grey sky—a swell letter from Jim DonneUr* CS.C., who inquires, among other things as to the whereabouts of one. Jack Hoyt, for the following reason; Jim is at the Foreign Mission Seminary, Brookland, D, C. and he is interested in collecting cancelled stamps to turn into cash for the Bengal Missions. His idea is to have clubs like the New York Cit^ Club gather stamps from th ^ members and send them on to him. Jack's address is 14 White Hall Hoad, I\ickahoe, New York, Jim, and I suggest that some of you other second vice-presidents dictate an inter-office memo to the third assistant mail clerk of your firms to save cancelled stamps and send them on to Jim or to me and I vnll be glad to forward them (Adv.) 
Jim also mentioned that Chick Sheedy will be ordained in June and that he occasionally hears from Jim Ross who is working for Colgate and from BiQ Hawes who is stationed in Washington with the Navy Aeronautics Bureau or Commis­sion or something. Some day w-hen I'm short of copy I'll tell you the tale of those famous Don­nelly educated dice that spread woe through the length and breadth of Howard Hall. But thereby hangs another story! Thanks anyway for the swell letter, Jim, just in case I forget to answer it before the next issue of the "Alumnus" comes out. 
There is an almost classmate of ours here in Chicago that I very seldom see but whom I followed daily and that is Jim Kcams, '34, who was a sports columnist for the "Chicago Daily News," and is now about to start with the new Chicago morning paper. Possibly his stuff is syndicated, if it isn't it ought to be, and some of you fellows in other cities may follow him, but at any rate, you should know about him. He looks the same as when he was editor of the "Scholastic," tall, lean-jawed, serious-faced, and a trifle stooped. His hair has receded a little but he hasn't put on any weight.- He writes with the clear, concise, picturesque bite of a Pegler without Pegler's acidity. I mention him at length here because he is one of us that is going to go places. Watch for him. 
Detroit in November was the scene of the na­tional convention of Real Estate Boards and your correspondent attended with the firm purpose of calling Ted Fcldman, Ernie Gargaro, Jack Breen, Vic Scitaeffner and some of the other local C.T.O. organizers but, I must blusbingly confess that the Detroit Eeal Estate Board kept us so busy that I didn't get a chance to make a phone call to get any news from that gang. 
One response to our lost and found call for help: Jack Lynch of Terre I&ute (you know— St. Mary-of-the-Woods) has been found. He's working for Royal Crown Cola in Dayton, O. 
The Northwestern game was something like the set-up for a college romance as you'd see it in the movies. The day was perfect, the girls gorgeous in their furs and yellow mums, (All right—^you spell it!) and the two crescents of Dyche stadium a solid mass of bright autumn colors that whis­pered and rippled as Don Ameche came in or roared and rose as a mighty wave to pay tribute to the final exits of those two magnificent line­men, Zieroba and Bauman. I can't tell you who was there from our class, almost everybody from the Chicago area I guess, but I did get a chance to talk to AI Diymalfki between the halves and to Ed H^eever, the Notre Dame backfield coach, who would have been in our class had he re­mained at Notre Dame. 
If you don't know what to do with that extra. Christmas card this year, why don't you jot down a few items of local N. D. gossip and send it along? I mean that spedfically for busy men about town like Gene Calhonn out in Los Angeles, Jim Clark in Jersey City, Smoky Coyne in Pitts­burgh, Jules de la Vercne in New Orleans, Hank Donalty in Utica, Johnny HcNeiU in Harrisbnrs and Bob Monahan in Worcester, Mass. And may I remind you, dear reader, as you grope for the alka-seltzer bottle on the morning of Jan. 1, 1942, that our Ten-Year Reunion is only a year and a half away!

From Bob CahiU: 
Needless to say, I hear from many of the boys throughout the season, but few of them give me any news for the "Alumnus." I wish they would send along a little filler together with their re­quests for tickets.

Even though I miss my home-town friends in the Memphis Club. I am looking forward to joining the Chicago Club. 
Recently I spent a very pleasant evening with GrenviDe Kinr» '34. from somewhere in New Jersey. He has been in the metallurgy division of the Camegie-HIinois Steel Corp., and has just recently been promoted to the job of "Bessemer Coordinator for the Chicago District," which is a mudi more impressive sounding title than just a plain "Assistant Buyer" like I am. The "Dear Vera" who used to get all those letters he wrote to Vassar, is a very charming hostess. 
I don't get to see my brother Walter Franiioli, '34. very often now. He's with the engineering department of the Power and Light Co. in Mem­phis, happily married, and doing quite well right there in the home town. But now I'm closer to my younger brother Frank FransioU. *39, who is in the engineering department of the Gary Works of the Camegie-HIinois Steel Corporation. He can pop over to the Loop from Gary about as qmekly as I can get downtown from Oak Park. 
I don't know if it's a "scoop" or not, but I'd like to report that HariT' Donnelly, '34, is now the prond father of a brand new danshter.

Romora amons: the profession indicate that he is one of the best air conditioning engineers in town. 
His wife is a descendant of Admiral Raphael Semmes of the U. S. Navy, and she has two brothers, Annapolis graduates, now in the Navy. So the new daughter won't know which side of the field to sit on when she starts going to the Notre Dame-Navy games. 
Ralph Ebe, Auburn, N. Y., writes: "Since last writing I've received a most agreeable surprise in that I was transferred from senior inspector of naval material to the position of associate engi­neer.

Anyway, there were Tom Campbell and John Broffgcr all the way from the furniture capital. Grand Rapids. Both boys had a grand week-end. for we saw them off for Michigan on Sunday aft­
The Notre Dame Aiumnus 
ernoon, and they were already promising to be back next year. 
Hike Layden was there, as were Joe Ratlsan and Fr. Dan Gleason. Mike is with Indiana Bdl Telephone Company in Indianapolis; Joe is in real estate and insurance in Bordentown. N. J., while Father Dan is with the Holy Cross Mission Band in the East. 
There was a military note to the Reunion lent by PVt. Jim Sherry* up from Camp Davis, N. C. on a 10-day furlough; Sgt. Joe Schmidt, from Camp Lee, Va.; and 2nd Lieut. Jade Britton who is stationed at the Army Air Corps base at Mitchell Reld, N. Y. 
George Milton, who was on hand with Mrs. Milton, reported that he is working on defense orders with his dad. turning out ammunition boxes in their Brooklyn plant. Bill Gillespie, who is going to law school and working for the N. Y. Tunnell Authority, and Panl Doyle of Union Carbon and Carbide, New York, were there. Joe Mansfield came down from Providence, R. I. for the week-end. 
Speaking of the military angle. Joe Sdiiuidt informed us that George Murphy is a 1st Lt. in the 6th Medical Batt.. at Camp Lee. Sgt. Boh Burke from Cincinnati was stationed at the same camp. Bill EUis is reported to be an instructor in the Air Corps. (We'd like further confirmation on this from you. Bill, so let's hear from you real soon.) 
Continuing with the round-up of the gang over the week-end, we missed a lot of the boys at the Reunion and Rally but saw the following on Sat­urday night in the Penn where the 0-0 tie failed to dampen anybody's spirits: Bob Cavmnaagh, the demon FDIO financier from Washington was busy shaking hands. Al Carey was receiving congratu­lations on the recent birth of Albert Daniel Jr. on Aug. 2. At is with the Touche Nevin ac­counting firm in New York. Hank MacDonald. with Globe Wireless, 29 Broadway, New York City, is another proud poppa, 
Walt Matusevidi was around to explain his absence from these parts for the last year or so. Seems Walt has been down in South America on an engineering job. It looks like further travelling for Walt as he was talking about Hawaii or the Canal Zone. 
Sherh Herrick and the Mrs. were in from up­state. Sherb reported that he may be in New York during the coming months. Upholding the advertising department of the N. Y. "Daily News" were Tom Fennelly and Tom Keenan. 
Panl Cammings reported that he is working on defense orders up in Worcester, Mass. Jiai Dot-ton, another New Englander, deserted the Collect­or of Internal Revenue's office in Connecticut for the day. We saw Joe McMahon, but didn't get a chance to find out what he is doing now. 
Howie Cusack and Luke Tieman, 'two newly married men, were receiving congratulations. Howie is with the Wilmark System in New York, while Luke is with International Business B{a­chines in Washington, working on defense orders. Doc Murray locked up his scalpel and forgot his medical duties in one of New York's larger hos­pitals for the day. 
I«ater that evening we bumped into more of the boys at another night spot. Bill Prange, who is charged with keeping traffic moving smoothly for the Anheuser-Busch Brewery in New York. told us that John Regan has re-entered the Sem­inary and will prepare himself for his life work in the Home Missions of the Carolinas. The best wishes of the class go with you, John. 
Incidental intdligenee pidsed up over tiia w«dc-. end: Somaone reported that Im Pii•ingot is takins th* Offieers* Trainias Coarse in or near Wadiingtoii, D. C. Jisi Walirai. '37, toM ns that brother.

Bfll Shem is secretary to Congressman William Pbdffer of New York City. Jim Kdlly took home a couple of choice seats for the Army game from the drawing conducted by the New York Club for the benefit of the Scfadlarahip Fond. Phil ClailBt is in the production department of the J. Walter Thompson Advertising Agency in New York City. 
We corddn't tell whether or not Notre Dame had a team after 60 minutes in the mud with the Army, so the following Saturday we boarded the . New York dab's ^edal train to the Navy game in Baltimore. We saw a whale of a contest, and a goodly number of *36ers indnding Say Kaaa from Clifton, N. J. Ray reported that he would get around to droroing this cohmm a letter one of these days with a bit of information. 
Sgt. Bin Fish showed op in oniform and in­formed as that he had been drafted while prac­ticing law following his graduation. Bill's practice has stretdied over the states of Arizona, Illinois and Indiana in the space of a few short years. 
We just managed a brief hello to Lo« . the ace salesman for Hallmark Greeting cards in Philadelphia. Lou was standing in the station as the train pulled into Baltimore, and we didn't get a chance to chin very long. 
During, or after the game, we met George Foss who is now a lieutenant in the Navy and is sta­tioned at the Naval gan factory in Washington: Frank Marphy, who was on home ground snce he lives in Baltimore: and Pat HaUoy who in­formed us that he is an enngn in the Navy, and is also stationed in Washington. We met several others, but since we lost the envelope on which we had jotted the various names, we can't supply them at this time. 
We regretted that we were unable to accom­modate Frank Jeyee with tickets for that game, but the club's allotment went like a '&easary surplus before a couple of congressmen. Frank wrote that he is with the Nylon Division of E. I. duPont in Seaford, Del. 
Hie Mail Bag: 

Congratulations are in order for I^« "Butch" Hanawan who was married Nov. 20 to Mary Ann Struck in Dayton, O.

Our last bit of mail was from Jim Eirby. who postcarded in from Detroit where he is stationed with the F. B. I. to say "hello." 
It was our privilege to wish Father Robert McKee, '36, and Father Jeny Lawyer, *35, as well as two Holy Gross brothers, bon voyage shortly before they sailed on a perilous ocean trip to the missions in India in November. The class is re-guested to remember them all in its prayers.

The school will last about nine or ten weeks more and then I esi>ect to be transferred to the new Barrage Balloon Camp, Gamp IVson. that is now being built near Paris. Tenn. From there it may be Panama, Trinidad, or almost any place." 

Arthur Chadwick writes on paper headed Medi­cal Department Detachment, 207th C.A. (A-A.), Camp Stewart, Ga.: "H e title is still private, hut I have received the rating of fourth class medalist, and am now the medical technician in our medical detadiment. However, in a short while I expect to change my status considerably because of my acceptance into the Air Corps. It will be several weeks before I officially transfer, but if everything goes as expected 1*11 be training to become a pilot by the early part of October. We have been through some of the hottest weath­er I've ever e3^>erienced here in Georgia. However, it has done me a lot of good because I've taken a lot of the accumulation from my waist line." 
From Tony Bbzziotti comes this word: "I'm in California at Camp Haan and have been here for seven months. My rank is private, but I'm in line for a commission very soon—it will be going from one extreme to the other—from private to second lieutenant." 

Howard Jeflfers, who is president of the St. Rita Holy Name Society of Chicago, wrote us recently about a large ddegation planning to attend the Notre Dmme-niinois game, bnt it came too late for a notice in the November issue.

From Paul Foley; 

Fresh from the Southern Cal game and just four days past the deadline—but thankfully facing a pile of letters so hefty we can scarcely see over it. It begins to look as though that turkey-red letterhead was a good idea. At least it's now oar hall for a change. 
First of all let's go over the correspondence with the fancy letterheads of the armed service— and they are growing more and more profuse among the *37 boys. 
Jim Gagnier^ who once made his home in the Old College building if I remember correctly, now hangs his service cap at the Air Corps Basic Flying School, San Angelo, Tex. Jim's odyssey may be typical so we'll review it briefly: "After Notre Dame I enrolled at Georgetown Law School, worked part time for Surplus Marketing Admin­istration imder the Department of Agriculture and finally went to work with them regularly. Then along came Uncle Sam last July.... I was work­ing in Boston at the time so I headed for Wash­ington. The government furnished transportation to Richmond and after three weeks we put out for San Angelo. Tex. I am now assigned to Post Headquarters—at $21 a month." 
Before his Army career started Jim had passed the District of Columbia bar and is now one of the few in that group sure of $21 a month. Wist­fully, we thought, Jim said "I would have been married last June but for the Army." 
Clem McGowan, we are told is now an F. B. T. agent and he was married Nov. S last. 
Next of the defenders of democracy is Ed Fox* now attached to the 7th Medical Training Bureau, Company B, Camp Lee, Va. Ed was also taken into that great fraternity last July, from Chicago. TVpical of what can happen. is Ed's remark: **l was originally classified as a quartermaster, but because of some error I was put in the medical replacement center here." But right now he is learning alt about anatomy, physiology, map read* ing, materia medica (The order is Ed's) and pharmacy. We bet that "map reading" will come in handy for a medical expert who started out as a quartermaster. Ed, by the way. is a corporal. 
Bob Bnrke is a sergeant in the Quartermaster Corps at Camp Lee and he and Ed are promoting a Notre Dame club at the camp. 
Wings touch off^ the next piece of letterhead, beautifully sedate gold wings, informing us that Ryan field, Hemet, California is the stop over point for Ridiard J. CarroU. Dick says he arrived at Hemet's sunkissed runways about the first of October for his primary training as an aviation cadet. After 20 weeks he expects to be commis­sioned a second lieutenant and must sign up for three years—^but it won't be all skittles and beer because the course is said to be very rou^ indeed. 
Dick, after saying he has lost contact with the boys, gives us some dope on the Chicago gang, to wit: John Coyle (more later) is also somewhere in the Army; Joe Dorgan is still with the "Dwly News" (Unless Mr. field got him by now); Bah Cronin is vice-president of an industrial roofing concern and, according to Dick, is "married to an exceptionally lovely young lady from Cindn­nati. Bill Kennedy and Arch Gott were married (not to each other) vrithin a couple of weeks of one another—^in short, things are good in Chicago. 
Dick says his Uncle Sam won't let him get married for a while under the terms of an Air Cadet contract. 
.Some things in life are still a great black mystery to us. For instance, we wonder just how one of our boys goes about "manufacturing sin­tered carbide tools and blanks"; or just what might "sintered carbide" be and what its poetic appeal to such a chap as Uriwn Daly, who is en­tering away at carbide down in Latrobe, Pa. In any event it is definitely geared to chemistry and chemical engineering—^you remember, those fellows who studied. 
Urban is with McKenna Metals Manufacturing Co. after two years prepping at Moraine Products IMvision of GMC in Dayton. O. Urban is a chief chemist, is unmarried, has missed the draft and has five non-chief chemists working under bis direction. 
Dr. Dan Nolan is now teaching at St. Vincent's in Ijatrobe. Jokn Pavlick is in that same vicinity working for Alleghany County. 
As a postscript Urban notes that Frank Meyers is with North American Aircraft in Los Angeles and is married. Frank Kelly is at Wright field in Dayton. 
Up a few paragraphs wc mentioned Robert J. Cronin, of Chicago, and now come upon an extremely fine letter from him. Bob covers his personal situation by remarking that he's follow­ing his &ther in the -construction business and realizes that he's still "following," which is more realization than many have. Bob reports on some of the boys, many of whom we've already cov­ered. He gives further data on Coyle by reporting that he's at Chanute Field, HI. and is the boy who has the dubious privilege of authorizing "leaves." 
From Bridgeton, N. J. comes word of Chadc Gnluua who has given up a very wandering ex­istence to settle down with the new Mrs. Graham and the Owens-Illinois Glass Co. will have to take care of itself, but the Grahams will be three when that son arrives next April. 
Chuck started out with Oil Well Supply Co. '^ o moved him from one tank town to another Uke a pawn in a chess game, so they lost a good man. 
Basil Gilkspie, we are most happy to report. is now at Rolling FVairie, Ind., studying for the, priesthood—somdiow we had a hunch about Bas. 

Ed Goldsnuth writes from Worcester, Mass.. which he calls home port and from whence be sallies forth to sell glass^vare, china and pottery . to department stores and ye gifte shoppes. Ed shames us with the news of Ed, Jr. He is now two-and-a-half years old and is probably starting to stroke curly blonde hair. Ed stayed in South Bend awhile after graduation to work for Joseph 
Denalme. 
John Heam gives us geographic balance by writing from Beverly Hills, Calif., where he says he has been located "on and off for five years." What he does vihen "on location" there we do not know. Jack says Hago SCeldiione is now with the Walt Disney studios grinding out Dumbos and whirling dervishes of various types. Jim Hanion says Smek, is "in the ^cinity." We don't con^der that red-hot reporting, but it is something. 
Tsny Bayot and his new bride touched at San Frandsco about Nov. 15, bnt from there they were on thdr own. Heam says that sooner or lator eveiybody from N. D. turns up in Southern Galifomia—a lot of their lads turned up in our beekfield about 2 p.m. on a recent Saturday, Brother Beam. 

Jim Hade has forsaken farcical boxing matches* 

mimicry of all types and descriptions and now 
holds forth as the lord-high resident manager of 
an apartment hotel at 5200 Sheridan Road, Ghi­
j^ago. In tact he has held forth in that capacity 
for more than three years, coddling: the iron 
whims of some 400 residents of his establishment. 
Jim says his job is too confining to give him much news coverage but he reports that Ade Jadae is with a flooring concern selling anything and evcrythins to go on floors except wornnrat guests; Coyne O'Connor is still with Chicago's First National Bank; Ed Reardon. who was work­ing out of Chicago for an insurance company, has heard the call and is now working for Uncle Sam; also in the armed forces somewhere, somehow is Bad Bonfield. 
Chick Haloney, like his Detroit imitator "May­or" Hastings, is carving out a most handsome career in the undertaking business (or is it more fashionable to call that profession "mortuary engineers"). Hack reports that Maloney flashed by 5200 Sheridan the other day in a new Packard ambulance t-h-a-t long. Maloney was in the driver's seat, of course. 
In spite of all the wonderful letters—and they are top grade in every resi>ect—there are a few from whom we would like very much to hear. For instance, we had a moon-struck postcard from Bob Grogan somewhere in Florida, but somehow, in the press of moving, etc. it was lost. Whip in something more substantial Robert; we have a little dope for you. Also we need a word or two of sage advice from Cy Stroker whose silence is appalling for an ex-managing editor. 
Speaking of editors, this month's copy of "On­ward and Upward" is awarded to Jack Gillespie who recently moved into the editorial chair of the "Westfield (N. J.) "Leader"—one of the classiest weekly journals you'll ever see. So it's Editor Gillespie from now on—^we knew he'd make it— one of our boys! 
One brother we absolutely must hear from, but quickly, is Jack Byrne, who is sulking in Bryn Mawr for some reason or another. 
Marvin Kmeger has formed a law partnership with Irving Gamttz with offices located in the Union Trust Building, Michigan St. and JefTerson. in South Bend. 
A letter from Bay McGrath reveals that he's now a corporal in the Coast Artillery at Camp Callan, San Diego, Calif. Ray writes: "Two other 
N. D. men have landed in D. E. M. E. with me so far. George Fcnn, *40, is now a Pfc. and works in Headquarters. Big John Ryan, '36, the boy with the beautiful baritone, just moved into barracks 2202 yesterday. He has been in the army only a few months and so has not received a rating as yet. He is planning to attend Officers Training School at Fort Monroe, Va.; so he should get a real rating when he gets one. I am now a corporal in charge of Barracks 2202, and have moved there." 
Ben Sdierer writes: "I was drafted in January, 1941. I was sent to Fort Dix and was assigned to the 119th Medical Regiment of the 44th Division and have been there ever since. On March 21, I was promoted to corporal and on April 21, to sergeant. My address is Co. B., 119th Medical Regiment, Fort Dix, N. J." 
John Moran, '36, donates this bit: "Here's an item for the *37 column as well as the 'Births, SherifTs Auctions, etc.* 
"Frank BciUy, '37, became the proud poppa of baby Justine, 7 pounds, 10 ounces, on Oct. 9 in St. Peter's Hospital, Brooklyn. Father is reported doing well." 
Dr. William J. Bailey is now interning at Mt. Carmel Hospital in Detroit after receiving his 
M.D. at St. Louis University last June. 
Frank Gaol has been appointed director of the* OYO for the diocese of Cleveland and will continne to serve as frosh coach of John Carroll's football team. 
1938 
Harold A. WilUuu, SM Ave., Baltimore, Hd. 
From Hal Williams: 

Before I list the fellows seen, and the news heard, over the Army game week-end, I would like to make several comments. "" 
First, one had to look twice at all men in uni­form; a number of the service men were Notre Dame boys. Second, in former years the class­mates were introducing Miss Glutz, of New Ro­chelle, or Miss Glamour, of Ho Hokus, N. J., or talking about, in the most nostalgic terms imag­inable, of the girls who haunted the Palais Royale of the Bend, This year, however, most of them introduced their wives and bragged about their children. Our classmates are mighty proud of their children. 
Third, it is getting increasingly hard to re­member names. The faces are familiar, but some of the names are beginning to slip away. I hereby apologize for calling some of the boys by their wrong names and forgetting, in two instances, the names entirely. But it works both ways. One fellow who used to sleep next to me in Economics called me "Ted." Another one called me "Albert," and a third, "Thaddeus." As far as I know there wasn't any "Thaddeus" in our class. 
Now for the names: 
Jack Doyle, who attended the reunion festivities Saturday night in the Penn with his charming sister, Pauline, reported that he is still running the family's haberdashery in New York. His old sidekick. Nelson Voge], is now married and living in South Bend, the scene of his former triumphs. Mr. and Mrs. Steve Dietricji were sitting next to Jack. Steve was bragging about his baby girl and telling me about his new job with the magazine "Cue." Or was it "Click?" Anyway, Steve is sell­ing space for the magazine and likes it very mudi. The Dietrichs are living in New York. Sitting with the Dietrichs was Tom Bond, of the Ohio Bonds. Tom is an inspector in the Wright Air­plane Company in Cincinnati. Tom said that his twin brother Jack is now in the Army and is stationed at Fort Sill, Okla. 
Art Mulhem, who graduated from the Harvard Law School, attended the informal reunion with his sister who is a sophomore at Notre Dame College here in Baltimore. Art reported that he is now working for a law firm in Newark, N. J. (24 Commerce Street) and that most of the work is with New Jersey breweries. Art said that his brother Jim has been drafted and is now get­ting up early every morning at Camp Croft, S. C. 
Hank Leader, looking more handsome than ever, was nearby with his wife. Hank is still working with the City News Association in New York as a reporter and rewrite man. Mr. and Mrs. Clark Reynolds also were present. Clark is still holding down his position with the Union Bag Company of New York. The Reynolds have a boy, Scott, three months old. Quite a boy, says Clark, beam­ing. Clark passed along the word that Leo Weldi, of the old Indianapolis crowd, is now in the Army and stationed somewhere in Colorado. 
Bill Costello was another of the class present at the Penn. With Bill was his charming wife who exhibited a picture of the Costello baby, Mary Elizabeth, eight months old and quite a charmer already. ^ Bill is working in the cost accounting department of the duPont Company in Fairfield, Conn., and living'in Bridgeport He said that he was attending the Notre Dune-Navy game in Baltimore hot I ^ not see him. Art PfcaiiB, looking prosperous and healthy, told me that he is finishing up at Ms medical work at'Comdl in June and that he will interne at Bellvne Hoqutal in New Tnk. I understand that it is quite an honor to be selected from hundreds to do work at Bellvoe. Phil Bayer* growing taller every min­ute, said that he enlisted in the Army recenfly and is at Mitdiell Field in New York attadied as a ground man to the Air Corps. Fliil is inter­ested in working in the finance department of the Army. Phil reported that his friend. Bad Mai^ has been seriously ill with the flu and pneumonia but is now recovering. Phil said that Bud is going to Florida for a time to recuperate. 
Bin GalKn. whom I called **Pete'* at first, was among the many present. I believe his wife also was there. The Gallina have a baby four months old. Inadentally, Bill still has that pearl he found in the oyster scrap one Friday in the west hall of the dining haU. Bill is working for the Union Carbide and Carbon Company in New York. Jae Careoraa is now an enngn in the Uniffed States Naval Reserve and is at the present time stationed on a battlediip somewhere in the Atlantic. Before receiving this post, be was teach­ing school at the Naval Reserve center at North­western Univernty. This information came froBt his sister who was attending the rally with your friend and my frioid, CUe Gallacher. whose Bos­ton accent is better than ever. X forgot what Chic is now doing but I did hear someone say that he is president of the Boston N. D. club. Standing near Chic were Hany (Shorty) Norris^ Ed Hogaiu Joiumy Pooxe. Johnny Pinas, and ChaiBe Welck. Pinas is an engineer in the structure d^artment of the Vought Sikorsky Airplane Company at Bridgeport, Conn. Welch and Poor are in Schen­ectady. N. Y. (who was the fellow who bet me that I couldn't spell it?) and are working, if my notes are correct, with Goieral Electric 
I talked over old times when Hogli 0*DonndI walked in. Hugh is still studying medicine at the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbis and at the present also is doing work at Bdlvue. Hn ^ was accompanied by an old St. Biary's gal who entered right into the spirit of the reunion. And then who blc^ in—late but in earnest—but the old politician. Charlie Calhhan. Charlie, who is deferred from army duty, is the press agent for the American League football league, and doing a mighty fine job. Attend the American League football games and don't forget to men­tion Charlie's name to the ticket taker. (Adv.) 
John Schemmer was wandering around the room, greeting old friends and asking for Tom BfaUican. Jc^n, who graduated with honors from Harvard Law, is now working in a New York law firm. Ed Bartactt was standing nearby with a very beautiful young lady who used to work for the "Baltimore Sun." Ed is still working for the "New York Times" and is now on the day rewrite desk. Sunday morning "Ed conducted me through the "Times" plant. 
And having the time of their lives, as they do at every Army game reunion, were Gene Vaaktt, Pvt. Jalm Kdly. of Fl(»tland. Uune, and Charlie DMIK. Don Hicfcey, the unoffidal mayor of the Bend, was in attendance for the first time in three or four years. Kelly, who was-drafted, flew up from the maneuvers in the Carolinas. Chuck is now.working for Don's father, Tom Hid»y, in the construction husness and is helping put up defense housing units in South Bend. Chuck is deferred from army duty and Don, who is still running his hamburger castle in the Bend, has yet to take his physical examination. He has his fingers crossed. 
I spent several hours with my old roommate. Bad Sihciw—d, and his wife. Bod is now living in North Tarrytown, N, Y., and working in the paymaster d^artment for the Chevrolet assemby plant up there. He told me or rather his wife did, that Paol HaclKs is operating his own collection agency in flint. Midi., is married and has a baby girl about two months old. Then I also saw Harold Ward ^ Hook Kerwin, Tom Sbeils, Dick MoUer (whom I called Jim Mulbem). Boots Mc­Carthy and wife* Danny Boyle, and Walt &Ionta­celli, who is now working in Philadelhia- Walt is another one of the old-timers \vho never misses the reunion celebration. Vic Mercado, is doincr graduate work at the University of Pennsylvania, and reported that Ed Hanley, '41, lives across the hall from him and studies at the ^Vha^ton School of Finance. Ed also was at the game and the reunion. 
Rigo DiBrienxa was at the Penn and he reports that he is a senior at the Long Island Medical School. Biggie looks fine and sends regards to all his friends. After the game I bumped into Frank Detcfaer on the muddy field but did not have a chance to say more than "hello" to him. I believe he is still teaching school. How about a letter, Frank? George Belanger, of AVhitehall, N. Y., was another of the old gang present He said that he is working for his father and that his draft number has not been called yet. He also passed along the word that Bill Robinson and his bride' stopped in to see him while they were on their wedding trip East but that he was out at the time. The Robinsons made their trip, George saiS, in a station wagon. George also reported that Tom Hardart is now in the Army and will not go for several months. It was reported that he was just about to be drafted or already had been drafted. And then there was Tom Flynn, now studying law in "Washington at Georgetown, streaming across the lobby with Pat Gorman. '39. Tom said that his old sidekick. Bill Coar, has been drafted and is assigned to some camp near "Washington. Pat also is at Georgetown. 
"Walking over to the Pennsylvania in the rain I bumped into Ralph Wacfater, '39, of Frederick, Md. Ralph said that he is now an officer in the Marine Corps at Quantico. He was to leave in several days for service in Puerto Rico. I also saw Joe HcDermott, another old Maryland boy who was a year or two in back of us at school. 
Also seen were I^ke Tieman. now of Washing­ton and Sandy Springs, Md., with bis recent bride; John Horan, the old "Scholastic" editor; Cy Stroker, and Jim Waldron. 
And that's my report on the Army game. I did not get a chance to attend the pre-gamc rally as I had to work Friday night in Baltimore so my notes are for the game and the informal reunion only, Ptossibly there were others there (I heard that Oindc Daly and John Cleary* were reported present but I could not find them) but the above-mentioned were the only ones I saw and remem­bered. If I have neglected anyone, my apolo^es. According to my notes, 38 fellows from our class were present Saturday night. Not bad, considering how the boys have scattered during the three years. *Just received a note from Cleary, he was at the game. 
And now for the Navy game in dear old Balti­more. The night before the game, my city editor sent me over to Washington to cover the rally at the "Wiliard Hotel. While there I talked to and saw Joe Crotty, Roger SaUiran, Bemie (Pete) Peterson. Ed Kavanangh (both still at Glenn L. Martin here in Baltimore). Francis Berry. Johnny O'Cozmor and Frank Brigjit. Both John and Frank are with the FBI in Washington. John must be carrying the troubles of the government on his shoulders as his wavy hair is now completely gray. I heard that Johnny WilMm, another operative for the FBI, is peeping over transoms in Seattle. Others seen at the rally were Delancey Davis, the old "Dome" man. Lake Tiernan and wife (liuke sure gets around), Joe Beinor and Wayne MiUner who 'was still rearing that dubonet shirt. 
I also had a few minutes with Jim Armstronir \tiio. in his usual modesty, did not mention his new job as publicity Erector of N. D. Congratu­lations, Jim. and to you too. Bill Docdey. 
Oh yes, I also talked to Tommy Flynn and Bemie Feeney, *39, at the rally. Bemie is in hU final year of law at Catholic University. Boh Hackman was another seen on the rally. Bob. now almost completely bald, is a lieutenant in the Marine Corps and is stationed at New Kver, N.C He has lieen in the ser^ace for about ten months. 
Bob had the following news to pass along: Chuck Beasley is also in the Marines (first lieu­tenant, I believe) and is stationed at New River. Chuck is married and has a son. Ed Uniadie is another officer in the corps and is now studying at the Artillery School in QuanUco, Va. Harry Fox, of Cleveland, who studied for a time as an Air 0)rps cadet, is engaged to be married "to the most lovely girl imaginable" Cfandc Blacalnso is teaching school in Cleveland smd is going into the Naval Reserve officers training school. 
Joe Cole, another of our old class, was there with a very charming young lady. Joe is attend­ing Georgetown Law. On the way into the Wiliard I bumped into AI Bntler and his wife. Al is work­ing for American Airlines in Washington and is living in nearby Alexandria, Va. 
After the game (which still has Baltimore hum­ming) there was a small informal reunion on the field of the Baltimore Stadium. I saw Lnke Tier­nan. Pat Gormaan. Ed Bartnett. Don Hickey, Joe Hart. '39. Walt Hontacelli. Bob Hackman and Bob Leonard and wife. Bob is still living in Soaford, Del., and doing fine. The Leonards have a young son and Bob said that he recently bought him an N. D. sweater. Twenty years from now we'll probably be paying $3.33 a piece to see young liconard (I think his name is Pat) playing fullback for N. D. Bob said that Ed Wrape is also in Seaford and has plenty of news if he can be made to write. How about a letter, Ed? It was reported that Walt Dnncan and Hsl Langton were seen around the bench after the game, but I could not catch up with them. 
Saturday night most of the boys adjourned to ihe Belvedere Hotel where we had the Baltimore version of the Army game reunion. Don Hickey. Chuck Duke, and Joe Hart were there for several hours after returning from Washington where they had to go to" get hotel rooms. Ed Bamett and Bob Hadcman joined the party for several hours as did Pvt. E^die Hattingly, of Cumberland. Bob Leonard was there and so was Frank Bricht and Phil Bayer. And so much for the two games-It was a great reunion and everyone had a swell time. 
Now for the mail. 
Hrst a letter from George ("Senator") Howard on the stationery of the Howard W. Phillips and Co., Washington. Says the "Senator": "I left the newspaper business about a month ago. and from the letterhead you can see that I am now in the general insurance and bonding business. On Sept. 
6. I was married to Miss Dorothy Archambault 
of this city, and we bought a hotise at 1017 Chelton Road, Bethesda, Md Johnny Braddodc got married in August; Jimmy Corcoran is in his last year at Georgetown Medical School... .** Thanks, George. 
And here is a swell letter from Dick Scannd] who is attached to Battery "A", Tlrst Battalion, First Rerfment, of the F-A.R.C., Tr. 1013. Fort Bragg, N. C. Says Private Scannell: "After read­ing the class notes column for these three years now I've finally gotten around to becoming a contributor. It was Ed Cronin's note in the last issue which lutmsed me from my lethargy—and besides time is strictly not o£ the essence in my present occnxwtion as yon can see by the letter head. 
"Hy OQtftionnaire arrived just in time to squash my promotion to branch office manager of the 
C. L T. Corporation &om which I am taking this uns(^cited Ie»ve of absence. I was inducted Sept, 9 and spent my first month in the army at Fort Devens. SCass., sweeping, mc^ping. washing win­dows, doinsT Idtdien detail, etc., imtil I was prac­tically the perfect housewife, never getting nearer to m piece of firearms than being challenged by a sentry. 
"Finally, on Oct. 9 I was shipped to this post where I am an embryonic artillery man. I have only run across one N. D. man in the armed forces and that is Tony Benedosso, 41,' who was the only other selectee from TOJ home town (Dev­on, Conn.) I hear regularly from Tom Uolligan and John Boarice^ but their activities are reported regularly in your column so we need not dwell tipon them. Tom. however, has passed his bar and is presently with his father's firm in Cleveland. He has .been accepted in the Naval Reserve V-7 class and will go to Northwestern for his en­sign's training. 
''Scetty Reardon is the toughest man in the states to get any information on—even his sisters won't give him away. I saw them at several par­ties in New York (at which the omnipresent Mr. Callahan was in attendance) and they hinted at jKissible serious intentions on the part of our gay badielor friend.... It's going to kill me not to be able to get out of this.... for the Army game, but even by plane I couldn't make it... . 
"How about soliciting the addresses of all '39 men in Army posts so that we might be able to locate each other. You know most of these places are so darned big that you never would know if someone was in another troop, company or battery ... . I forgot to mention that I i^n into Pan! LodMr at a night spot on my last Saturday night home, first time I have seen him since we used to hold down the dean's office together... /' 
Ilianks, Dick, and good luck. Ne:ct month, if I'm not too lazy. I'll print all the names of the boys in service and their addresses. 
llien there were letters from Don Hickey, tell­ing me he would be at the Army game; one from John Cleair telling about the "soft" life he is leading on the maneuvers in the Carolinas and asking for tickets for the N. D. - Navy game, and one &om Biggie Di Brienza also requesting tickets for the game. Hie tickets were sold out sis weeks before the IdckofF and 1 could not oblige. I didn't see them tearing down the goal posts after the game, so I suppose they did not make the swell 
And then there was the vers* sad news about the death of OUie Helland, from Wisconsin Dells, who was killed Nov. 3 in Miami. Fla.. when a Naval R^erve plane crashed after failing to come out of a spin. OUie was one grand fellow, one of the gayest, if not the gayest, fellows Tve ever met at N. D. 
^ e only other news concerns myself. During the first week in November I took my draft board physical examination and the eNamining doctor said, "Your in fighting shape." The draft board tells me I will probably be inducted some time in Febmary. 
That's all for the month. How about some let­ters, boys; especially from you fellows who have never kicked through with a letter^ You know who I mean.

Howard Bilger sends along this letter: "I hap­pen to be among the luckier ones who have secured a commission even though I am only a second lieutenant, finance Department, which in many peoples* nunds is lower than a buck private. I am stationed at the State Arsenal, St. Augus­tine, Fla., which is the state headquarters for the Selective Service, and our department, the United States Property and Disbursing Office, which is now involved in clearing up the federal connections with the Florida National Guard, and preparing for their return from federal active duty. My field service during the past year has been limited to one week at Camp Blanding, Fla., during which time I attended school. As can be seen by this account, my military record has not been a heroic one but it has been interesting work, and money and property accounting is right down my line. 
"As far as I know, the only other local N. D. man who is in the service is Gard Oliveros, *41, who enlisted as an Army Air Oirps cadet and the last I heard he had soloed and was doing fine." 
- Robert MitOen sends us this information on the back of his centennial questionnaire: "I seldom see other N. D, men at the University of Chicago, or elsewhere in the city. My studies have kept me rather close to the university. Present conditions interrupted the prospect of getting my M.A. this year. Changing to a completely different field, from modem languages to history of art, necessi­tates the lengthy time to obtain my M.A. 
"On Oct. 20, X was sworn into the U. S. Navy Reserve, I exjiect to start work this November. My two years spent in Germany are proving worthwhile now, for I shall commence my work as a petty officer, second class, with the Naval Intel­ligence Dept., utilizing, of course, my knowledge of German. It seems very probable that I shall re­main in Chicago^ and will be able to live at my present quarters. With this opportunity I hope to be able to work evenings on my M. A. thesis and perhaps obtain that degree within a year or so." 
From Frank Valetich we learn that he is a coriX)ra1 in the first Chemical Company (Lab­oratory), C.W.S., in Edgewood Arsenal, Md. Frank Kroeger* who is taking a three months advanced radio training course, tells us his present address is 33rd Co., 4th Stud. Trng. Bn., C.C. 8. Fort Benning. Ga.­

From Vince DeCoarsey: 
After last month's sorry effort at a column a few of the boys must have had qualms of con­science—for what seemed to he a deluge of mail disturbed the dust that had been collecting in our mailbox since the first of the month. Hits month's haul is the richest in many moons, and it comes none too soon for an ailing, anemic column. We are profoundly grateful, and beg that the good work be continued. 
To get at probably the most important item of the month first; a note from Bill Dooley early in November said that Ollie Helland had been killed in an mr crash near Miami where he was ip training. We know nothing of the details of the accident other than it happened and wish that Dick 0*31clia or one of the hoys there would en­lighten us. The loss of Ollie brings the whole war thing very close to home. There was not one of the class who knew Ollie who didn't like him. and we can't ourselves believe that he is dead. To all his family and relatives this class extends heartfelt sympathy. 
At the Illinois game we bumped into Dan Shcc­dy wearing an ensign's uniform, but unfortunately can't remember where he was stationed, ^nunk it was the aircraft carrier "Hornet." Right. Dan? 
We also bumped into Sara Wheeler, Rod TToa»­dale, and waved at Bart O'TooIe. Wheeler and Bob Carmody live in the same apartment in Chi­cago; both are married. Sam is taking the bar next year, in July, I think; and going to law school right now, while working during the day. Jim Rocap., after taking the bar in Indianairalis, had the good fortune to be physically fit enough to aid in the defense effort and is now in the Army, along with an amazingly large number of others; Tom Walker is at Fort Dix, Charles Sidner at some camp in California, Bart O'TooIe in the wilds of Alabama or Louisiana somewhere. And all this army information from just one man; wonder just how many there actually are? Sam also said that Dan Ryan was taking the Illinois bar in March and living in Chicago. H. Borda had a defense job somewhere, my writing bdng none too good at this point. Monk SalUran is with Western Arms. Jim McGoldrick still at N. D. law school. And this ended all the information that Sam had. If we could talk to about ten or more of the boys a month perhaps we could have some sort of a line on what the rest are doing out in the cold, cruel world. 
Rod Trousdale we bumped into for just a few minutes outside the gates and he gave the infor­mation that Joe Moorman was in the Army as a pilot in Jacksonville. Fla. 
Coming back home after the game, it was a delightful surprise to find several letters waiting for me. First one from a very faithful correspond­ent. Dino Falaioni, reporting the doings around Albany. Dino is at Albany Law School and his 
35 
letter says:"It's about time I reported from' 
Albany I«w Sduol, ao hem goes. The draft man­. aged to set just one of the N. D. boys here^ Jade Flaaacaa. *40. He is takins a preparatory eomrae at N. Y. U., and then vUl go in as a naval ensixn. Bah Ortale is in his last year at Albany Law and 
is doing very well for himself. 
"Andy Fiadaicy, *40, is a classmate of mine; we both have one year after this one. Heniy Ffnr—f, *40, is also in the class. Visited Andy Wason tills sommer while he was stationed at Fort Niagara. He is in Gamp Lee, Va., at the present time. Would like to hear from the boys so don't forget the address, 118 So. Lake Ave.. Albany, N Y." ' 
A nice long letter from Jae Hannan was the second thing we opened and we do hope that Joe has wrung enough rain oot of his system to write the news of the Army game as he has promised. Incidentally we did hear in an indirect way that Ed O'Cannor. late of Rhode Island, made barrels of money at: the game nmnilig outboard motor boat excursions across the field. But Joe says, and we quote: 
"In the lapse of two years since our graduation you, in your busy role, have forgotten that a chap named Joe Hannan exists. To the contrary. and I have decided to come out of hibernation. 
"As previously announced in the "Alumnus;" the South Bend s ^ that occopied so much of my time and I were married in December following gradu­ation, and now have a four month old daus^to^. Sheila Ann. a true Irish lass with eyes as bine as the lakes of Killamey. Jim Tonsey contributes the qoip that she 'doesn't look like her dad.' JHm and Bin Lang. '29. were in Poughkeepsie for a talk to the Colombian Squires of local council number 304. Jim appears to be quite pleased with his newly acquired position. When I received his phone call from one of our leading hotels I im­mediately went down with the express purpose of inviting him oot to the house for dinner, in spite of the fact that I remembered his prodiguous appetite while at school. Well, you know Jim—his 'no* means 'sore.* so he and Bill checked out. I satisfied Jim concerning Vassar by taking him out for a passing view of that school and its environs; and thoice home. We had a very pleasant time recollecting past escapades, but the evening was all too short. Their meeting was scheduled for seven o'clock, after which they had to catch the 
10:09 train for New York, I delivered the boys to their hosts and took my leave. I'd like to say here that it's 'open house always* at the above address for any Notre Dame man passing through this vast metropolis. 
"From my father-in-law, Lt. CoL B. G. DnBois. late of the Umversi^ faculty, and now stationed in the Canal Zone as adjotant-general of the Cari­bbean Defense Command, comes the news of the existence of another Notre Dame Club, that in the Zone. Among its members are All-American BUI Shakespeare* now connected with Westingfaouse. Joe Harrinstaa, of the Oostoms, Major Brady* '24. of the Jodge Advocate Court in Panama, Bill Allen and Jack White, both '31. and Lt. William Cavcnder, *35. of the Medical Corps. 
"There has been a scarcity of personal news from '39ers. Would like to hear from Tom IQnr* who. I understand, has a b<v for my girl; Waft Cottmi, Ray Sdledi, Frank Loack, Gas Benedetti. Jae Leistar* Jade MaUcring. Guess that is enough for this trip. 
"This past week the local Knights of Columbus held its annual Cohnnhos Day dinner, at whidi the goest of honor was Jade Lavelle. '28, ardi­ffiocesan Erector of the OYO in New York City. He had as In the aisles* with Us repertoir of stories in Jewish and Irish cBalect. and. in all, was agreeably leedved as an after dinner speaker. 

"Guess that is all for now, Vinre. Will -nrite aerain soon, probably after the bis get together in little old Kew York, Oct. 31, at the Commodore Hotel." 
Joe lives at 3 Marple Road. Foughkeepsie, N.Y. And we'll bet he won't hear from half of those he wants letters from—we never have. 
liater in the month a letter from Phil Moloney. It seems to us as though this Army, Navy, and Marine situation is taking most of the people we know. Phil is with the Marine Corps, being sta­tioned at the Hazine Barracks, 8th and Eye Sis. S.EL, Washington, D. C, after receiving his com­misdon last May. Joe Stobb of our class. Bob Hackman and Ed Heaney of other classes, are with him. Phil would like to hear froni Jack Griffin, Ed Beinor, and Buck HcArdle—^as would we. 
He says that there is quite a crew of the boys in the Marines, and in and around Washington. Al Brown is working for the C.A.A., and he and Phil have long sessions wondering how Alike Blearing is getting along. Frank Pitman is with the F.BJ. (as I remember someone saying, along with Pat Bmzinon), Gas Fipp is also in this or­ganization according to Al. On leave in Richmond, Va„ Phil says Fnnk Kelly's hitting the books at Virginia Mescal College, as is Busty Riley. In New York. Phil's roommate. Jack Gilmonr, would be in the Air Coips by this time. Ed Hughes is with Arthur Eudner's advertising agency and is deferred from the draft. George O'Neil is com­
.ing right along in his effort to make New York Pepsi-Cola conscious. George and his wife, (the former Bee Majewski of St. Mary's fame) have a very nice npartment about a drive and four iron from the Hughes home. According to Phil, the pictures of George's wedding, with Jerry Doyle, Jade Sullivan, Bro. Ibjcwski, Jimmy BIcGoldrick. and Walt Haken very much in evidence, made him feel homedck. And if Phil made both the Army and Navy games we would appreciate another of those nice letters, -with detmled accounts of what 
•went on. 
My younger brother reported that he bumped into Pat Gorman at the Navy game, but aside from that there was nothing in the month about either Army and/or Navy game, we hope to have something on this next month. Last year Bill DooncXIy covered the Army game to the last piece of melting ice; being married this year he will probably be a little less able to get aronnd. hut nevertheless he ought to have a lot to say about the subiect. "We're waiting to hear from him anyway. 
Don O'Helia, in the law firm of O'Melia and Kaye up in Biunelander, Wis., got a letter on the last dogsled before the big snows and just made this edition. In his letter Don mentioned Ollie Helland, apparently not knowing of Ollie's death at the time. We rejieat we wish Dick O'Melia, or anyone else^ would write in details of what hap­pened. Don writes: 
"After just leading the Notre Dame 'Alumnus* for November, I thought st best to answer your call for letters while the mood was on me. 
"As yon probably know, I graduated from the Marquette Law School this past June and Dick has been in the Marine Air Cotps at Pensacola since last February, as a cadet, and is to get his wings sometime around the first of December. I enjoy versr mndi the practice of law and intend to make it my life work. 
"I had a surprise vidt from Byron Casey in September. He is still attending medical school in Chicago, and has, I believe, about a year before he is graduated. We had a fine talk and enjoyed reminisdns about the good oM days. I have had two letters fmai ^^scent XMIard recently. He is stationed at NorfbQc, Va. and has escaped the draft by faeccnning a phsracal ed. instructor under 
The Notre Dame Alumnus 
NO JANUARY ISSUE 
Following its prmctice of several years' sUmdinsr* the ALUMNUS will have no January issue. The February number will, according^ to present plans^ be printed in the final week of January. Secretaries of the clubs and of the classes are asked to have their next copy at the editorial office not later than January 15. 

Gene IHmney, no less. He enjoys the life and corresponds with the numerous Notre Dame boys in the service, including IMck. I also had a letter from Clark Volberding, who is managing a hotel in Li\'ingston, Mont. He sees Ed Simonidi oc­casionally. Ed is coaching at Carroll College in Helena, Mont. He reported that Ed is employed by the State of Montana during the summer months to tour and give illustrated lectures on Temperance. Can you imagine that? 
"I was very happy to see Frank Novak's address listed in yonr.column and I intend to write him immediately after this letter is completed. Dick and I saw a great deal of ODie Helland during our first year at Blarquette. Ollie, as you know, lives at Wisconsin Dells and so got into Milwaukee quite frequently. He is now in the Navy Air Corps and is down at Pensacola with Dick. 
"Jim Tansey expects to be out in the Middle West sometime after the first of the year on busi­ness. He is now associated with the flights of Columbns, organizing as I understand it, the Junior Knights, or Squires, as thrar are known. And should he drop in on you, please tell him that Margaret and I expect him up this way without fail. I certainly wish I could get in to Chicago for the Northwestern game—I'm afraid of that one, but the trip down and the get-together of some of the boys would be well worth the time." 
A few more letters like that would he appre­ciated. 
Just before sending in this mass of information, enough for two ordinary months (but let's get more in next time), went bowling with an indus­trial league here in town and who came down to watch the fun, but Frank Toyne and Jnlie Tons­meire. Both Frank and Julie are at the Lake CSty Ordnance Plant here in Kansas City; Frank with Remington Arms and Julie with V. S. Rubber. Julie later will be transferred to Omaha where his company is opening a plant like the one here. Information garnered, over a few beers, included (more next month, not enough time before they closed the place to get anything else) ; Dan Kelly is with General Electric; Greg Rice is a wolf, as Julie. Dave Meskill, and Ed Disser can testify; Tim Bradley is at Maxwell Keld, Montgomery, Ala. 
And a second call, this one on this very eve­ning came from none other than Barky Grimes, still flitting about the country with the Army. Although Burley says that he is a civilian, he is with the Army in the propellor division. 
And - that ends a month's work that we are really proud of. Look at all that information, wonderful, isn't it? How about beating the record next time and finding out what everybody is doing, and where he is doing it? TTiere ought to be some pretty good atdries about the Army game coming out of New York—how about pas^ng some of them on ? See yon in 60 days. No January issue as usual, so February ought to he crowded. 
From Dave MeddU: 
Hie Army game week-end featured by the game, 

reunion at the Commodore, and Satnrday night at 
the Flenn brought even more than the usual-num­
ber of the old gang, despite the fact that the 
dampness prevented the impromptu rally on the 
50-yard line after the game. 
Biggest treat of all was the arrival of my old roomie, Ed Diaaerp in from Fort Wayne for our first meeting since we left sdiool. The first i)erson 
- we met in New York was Elmira's Paal Dtmovan (who begged for some publidty), still a sdioolboy studying law, but now an old married man. Ed reports that Paul's brother Elmiran, Tom King, is accumulating a fortune rapidly for his wife and family \rith IBM in Fort Wayne. 
Felix Toner turned up on his first trip south from Alaska (where, he claims, the climate is far better than here) and a very nice wife, who, de^itie advance notice, did not wear a parka or drive down on a dog sled. Hempstead is heard from again: Charies Hayden Streator has taken xmto himself a wife. John Ennis, is still rooting for North Tarrytown. Bob "Stupe" Ortale, an­other law student, was on hand, sporting a con­aderahly reduced waistline. 
liong John Gallagher flew in from Chicago where he is now a big rubber magnate, while John "IBM" Toomey and Paul McCormack dropped in from Hartford. From Schenectady came Steve and Bernice Sznmadiowski and Harry Stevenson. Steve is still with American Loco­motive, while Harry, looking very scholarly with glasses, is in the General Electric general office there. 
Among Uncle Sam's boys in the crowd were Harry Boijrrert» Naval Reserve, stationed in New York, Bab Fitnimmons, with the tank corps, Phil Makmey, Marine Reserves, Jim Connell, Army Air Carps* Portland John Kelly, in the Army, and a corporal from *36 who was much dismayed on not finding anyone he could recognize. Chide GUlagber represented Boston as usual, while among the Bridgeport gang were Bill Costello, Tom Harphy, the Brcnnans, Paul Castner, and Hany Norris. 
Rhode Island delegates included C. G. BCacdong­aldt Jae McDonald and Rnss Hunt, just returning from his honeymoon. Father Frank Gartland, down &om North Easton, must have felt right at home surrounded by the old mob all evening. Greg Rice let US down by refu^ng to tell any stories in his ^)eech Friday nii^t, and was so drenched sitting on the bendi dnring the game that he went home Saturday night before we could see if he really did siirink (as Ortale claimed). 
Pat GwMan kept his record intact, but missing for the first time was Jim McGoIdrick. Hugo Wiaterrawd, now an FBI agent, r^^orted a num> ber of N.D. G-^nen. Tom Rels and Lany Sdunidt came down from Bridgeport with us, Tom to meet a beautiful blonde &om South Bend (!) and Larry to greet every skinny (there aren't many of them left) classmate of ours with the comment. . "I used to haA on yon!" 
We spent the usual well-fed week-end with the Tansaiiere'a In Brooklyn, hut without Jnlie* who is now in Kan*"** (Sty training for an excellent production podtion with U. S. Rubber at Des K<nnes. Ha reports that he has been well taken care of t y Al Sdkaitx and Frank T«yne out there.

From Bab Sanford: 

Our football team has iieen climbing to glory. but not the class of '40. Here we are once again In the doldrmn of a news column with no news. One would think that on these pleasant evenings with nothing to do some of you ndgfat think of Notre Dame. If you don't care to entertain sadi delightful memories think of Saaferd and his empty mailbox. Then in an effort to cheer yooiv self up. why don't you sit down and write him a letter telling him what yon Iiave been thinking. (Please try to include a few news items, so that at least part of the letter can be published.) 
No Icidding, fellows, the news has been so scarce this year that I even thought of publishing some of the letters I recdved last year (I actu­ally did receive some many months ago—just bragging). 1 waited to send the news in this month, and for once the waiting was not In vain. Ed Hatthews wrote a note and his opening para­graph Is so descriptive that I can't wait any longer before letting yon read it. Ed writes; 
"After reading your scant column in the Octob­er issue of the 'Alumnus,' 1 decided to let you know what I know about some of the fellows. [Ed, that column wasn't as lone as you think— most of it consisted of a picture of some of the boys in camp.l 
"Visited with George Becker and wife In Dallas. Tex. in September. George is contemplating a buriness of his own, manufacturing stoves. Also saw Walt Fleming and Iiis wife. Both George and Walt are very happy and doing quite well. Learned that Jim Foley is In the Army. 
"Had a letter from J. J. Hayes, ex. '38, who is in the Army at Warren Field, Wyo., having interrupted a career In the banUng business in Kdina, Ho. He informed me that Chailie Batdwas 
(known to some as 'Hutch') is married, as is Toauay FItipatrick. Tommy Is coaching at some school on the Pacific Coast His room-mate. Narr HandiaBsen, has been drafted as athletic Instruct­or in Jefferson Barracks In St. Louis. 
"Johnny Kerrigan was married last Christmas to Betty Cook. Bin Ratlgan married Cbrthea Rattsh of East Chicago during the summer and the last I heard was that he is working for a furniture company In Miami. 
"Hiere goes my Information aiwut the men of '40. There are still a lot of the Ixtya I wonder about. Ed Haston. Tom Haekett. Pa d Hdlmath. and so many others. I enjoyed hearing about Neal Gkason and Dan Hnshek and the Fcmcding boys. Perhaps by the .time the next 'Alumnus' comes out we'll hear aiwut more of them. 
"Bad Lenilian is still with Carnegie Illinois Steel in Gary and Tom Hoaty was operating his insurance business last June. 
"BIO ToUn. my ex-roomie, worried the sammer out fretting about hia draft number. However, I think that he has joined the Navy as a means of escape. Have seen Paal Borgaun here in Svaas­vllle several times. lately. Jerry CDswd and Bill Mooney are still on the campus struggling along with that law coarse. Learned that Hank Eagd has married His lady friend from Indianapolis.

I was sent down here very shortly afterwards and was made a corporal a few weeks afiw. You misht also be interested to know I announced my engagement to the one and only who was out to both the Junior IV>m and Senior Ball. The name will have been Jeanne Walsh after December. 
"I haven't noticed the names of the N. Y. boys so perhaps I can help. Bill Ticker has been work­ing in New Bochelle awaiting a government job. I think, with the F.B.I.; Bod HcGaire is working with his father in the construction business. Tom-n y Philpott is with the Marines; Bill Hatpin is studying accounting and is trying for an office job -with the Na\'y. I haven't heard anything from or about Dan Malvey except that he was an usher at Pat 0*Nein*s wedding. Bill Cleary also is an unknown fjuantity, the last I heard he was with scHne munitions manufacturer. Chris "Junior" Qoinn stcqiped in at my home while I was down here, and I understand he is just about the same; he is working for the Leigh-Portland Cement Co. Dick FaDon has entered St. Joseph's Seminary after taldng a year's course at Columbia Law School. I wonder if Eddie Hart has recovered from the world series?" Ditto Joe Mangano. 
"Please tell roomie Jim Brown to copy the abwe address and write if he finds time." 
Thanks, Gerry, and you hit the nail on the head asking Jim Brown to write, haven't heard anything about him. 
Another man working for XTncIe Sam reports from maneuvers somewhere in N. C. Roch LcPagc sent the following card: "Am now in intelligence neetion of an infantry regiment. Heard from Jade Reddy last week; he's been drafted and is in the Air Corps doing office work at Windsor Locks Air Base in Connecticut. My base address is Pvt. J. R. Le Page. Jr., A.F.O. 2G. Reg. 
H.Q. Co.. 181st Inf.. Camp Edwards, Mass." 
Ihanks for the card, Roch. I hope you have set a good (example for the rest of the fellows, bc­otuse I appreciate cards almost as much as letters. 
Army Air Corps reporting in the name of Tom Uston from Kelly Field. Tom says: "Since ii looks like you have been a little short of news lately I decided to send some of the dope I have on the boys. 
"I hear from Jack Rogers quite a bit. He is in the Marine Air Corps at Jacksonville. Fla.. and expects to finish his training shortly before Christ­mas. Eddie Barice is an ensign, and is going to be sent to Cornell for special training in Diesel work. Sounds like a srreat break. Bill Hopkins put on enough weight to pass the Naval Air Corps physical, and -is just waiting his orders to be mo\'ed out for primarj* flight training. Probably will go to Glenview, only about five miles from here. 
"As for myself I am in my last week here at Kelly Field. We will be graduated some time in November and I am hiding against hope that I won't get foreign service; I have asked to be stationed at Orlando. Fla., where John Henebrs" is located at present. 
"I imagine you know that George Weber was killed in a crash down here a while back; it was really quite a blow, as George and I had become rather close since we were at Randolph together. Oh yes. speaking of Randolph reminds me that Tex Barreda is over there now. 
"Have to get scHne rest for a night cross country flight but I'll write soon." 
Tliat's great, Tom. you will have been graduat­ed by now, so congratulations and good luck. It was a fine letter and I'm looking forward to hearing from ytm soon. Please give ns your new address so we can write you. 
Last year I was talking about the "long-lost" members of the class of '40, this year it looks like the "Long-long-lost" group. Certainly would like to hear from some of you including AI Ke^ sing, Frank Alleffm, Jim Doyle, Ji™ Barrett, Hank Dowd, Jerry Flynn (what has happened to him?). Tad Harvey, Bad Rokrtshaw, Jim Rogers, Tom Minoffue and everyone else that would like to make me work nights trying to get all the news published. 
I want to wish all of you a Merry Christmas, and will be writing again next year. Sec you then. 
This letter from Leonard Barton: "I am an ensign on the U. S. S. New Orleans, a heavy cruiser. At present we arc in Bremerton. Wash. For the past two years we've been in Hawaii. I was out there four months or so. Where we'll go next. I don't know and couldn't tell you if I did. Address any man in the Navy to his ship (with rank and division c/o Postmaster, San Francisco or New York). Captain Burnett, whom I hear is now commanding officer in the Notre Dame R, O. T. C. unit, was before that a com­mander and executive oITicer on this ship." 
From Scott Held. 111. comes a letter from Walter Sweitzer, Jr., who says: "There are two other Notre Dame men located here in my detach­ment. They are Raymond C Fitzgerald, ex. '40. who finished at Detroit U.. and Sam Lawler, Jr., *.*58. We are aviation cadets in training for com­missions as officers in communication, IT. S. Army air corps. We will be commissioned as second lieutenants after a seven months course. One course here at Scott Field lasts 16 weeks." 
Jim Donoghae, in the Candidates Class Detach­ment, Barracks "E." U. S. Marine Barracks, Quantico, Va.. writes: "I have been transferred to Quantico where on Nov. 1. I should begin work for my commission. Right now I'm standing by and doing a little office work. Before leaving Parris Island. I had talks with Lt. George Hag­gcrty and Lt. Tom Philpott. They are both in the Fleet Marine Force and keep very active with their maneuvers. They both told me that Bill Hannan is a lieutenant in the F.M.F.. but I did not get a chance to see him. I have not rxm across any N. D. men here as yet, but there should be some in the new class." 
According to a news clipping Ensign John Fcmeding left for New Orleans, La., in late September. He will be stationed there for a short time prior to going to Ptortland, Ore. His brother. Gnsign Thomas Femeding, left in September for San Pedro, Calif., where he will be stationed. Both of the Femedings were graduated from the Northwestern Midshipman Naval Reserve School. 
We received an interestingr note from Joe Gore's father who says that Joe's address in Hawaii .is Casual Detachment, Bellows Field, Waimanolo.­
T.H. Joe is attending the University of Hawaii. taking Spanish and Hawaiian, preparatory to becoming an officer. 
Two of the '40 men are working for the Chicago division of Studebaker. Carl Qninn is timekeeper there, and Joe O'Connell is head timekeeper. 
Bill Mej-ers was admitted to the Dlinois Bar in October, but his plans are indefinite since he is subject to military sen-ice. 
Ray Fjdler. now studying at the Universily of Southern California, was recently elected to Delta Theta Phi, the national honorary fraternity com­posed of law students of exceptionally high scho­lastic standings. 
Ben Sheridan is (was) head football coach at Fort Riley. Kuis. Bennie recently was married

From Jelin Patterson: 

Whoever used the stimulating h>-podermic is wholeheartedly thanked. It was a shot in the arm that broaght a flow of letters. 
As deadline time nears, there is great anticipa­tion on this side of the fence. Reason—I will have seen the Northwestem-Notre Dame game before the December "Alumnus" is printed. And if plans jibe, I'll also have seen former roommate Ray Pinelli in Chicago. 
Ray has gone the way of many others from his class; he has been drafted, being plucked from the baseball players crop. He's at Camp Grant. 
III. And, by the way, also at Camp Grant is Paul Scally. 
Paul sent a card to reveal his whereabouts, he gave out information about Charlie Crimmins and Bin Bogan. Chuck is in the Army. Bill also—with the Medical Corps in Fanama. 
Jack Landr}- came through with an epic letter. His phraseology was, to say the least, immense— the 50 cent words were nil over. 
From Jack, comes more dope tinted with khaki. He is still a civilian, but the boys he reports of i'.re mostly sojers. 
Landr3'*s lulus: "Swamp Fox" Bill Marsh is flying high out at Taft, Calif. Likes it too. Bnzz Ccnvcrse is an air corps bird in Chicasha. Okln. Bad Longo and Frank Santos have finished prep training in Chicago with the "Fighting Irish" squrdron, and Bud is now in Jacksonville—rthnt's where potential instructors go; 
A couple of non-militarists. Jade O'Brien and Don Tledemann, are enrolled at Har\*ard Business School. And (to quote Landry) "Frank Wemhofl' wAs in the process of endeavoring to insinuate himself in the Naval Intelligence." 
After visiting the campus for an "all too short week-end," Jahn Aaelage, another of Dr. Cooney's boys, fired a letter from Mansfield. O. John is with the Army Ordnance as a civil service em­ployee. He is working out of Cleveland as an inspector of ammunition. 
According to former Journalism major Asebge. Jidc MMrtaagii is working in Chicago; George Fazzi is in national defense in Philadelphia: ­Tony BencdoBSO is stadoned at Fort Eustis, Ya.: George Mdtser is at Camp near Cheyenne, Wyo. He'<: a bookkeeper in the Quartermaster Corps. Red-headed Tom Carrigan, scourge of the facul^ dining hall. Is out in Denver working for Rem­ington Arms. 
Out of Fort Knox, K>'. comes news from Pat PatiuuB. the wise old owl of the Phy Ed division of Ml. Pat is seriously contemplating a switch to the air force, but is on his way up to higher rank at Knox. He's been made a lance, corporal, is . drilling the boys and leading calisthentics. 
Pat's former roomie, Sam Yezeraki, is working in Lewistown, Pa, with a silk concern. Sam ex­pects to play a bit of basketball on the company 
five. F^t saw the N. D.-Illinois same, and while on the campus, ran into Don KraloTee who is in the Naval Reserve. 
From the windiest of all' cities and from the greatest of all. Doctor Cooney's boys, Dick Shaofh­nessy* a letter came. Dick is waiting for his invitation to the draft, in the meantime working for Commercal Credit in Chicaso. He includes concise notes about a number of his fellows. Fran Carey is in the Army in Texas; Jerry Dwyer is in the cavalry. E4 Blalone studies law at North­western ; Bob Kcnncy does likewise at De Paul. ("BiU Schaller hncked away at the National Am­ateur golf meet at Knollwood."—That's a little while aso.) 
The lengrthiest epistle of all came from the '41 "Scholastic's" "ColleBe Parader," Ray Kelly. If Ray has joined any more clubs since gmduation. he did not mention it in his letter. 
Some real inside stuff is included in Ray's note, some fine statistical material. It pertains to a statement made in one of his columns in the "Scholastic" of last year. He claimed that one out of every five St. Mary's girls marry within five years after graduation. So—what happens? 
Still interested in "the Rock" (one alumna. Kay IiaVaaseur. in particular). Ray i>oints out that the "one of five" are dther already wed or dam close to it. Just for example—Ray and Kay are engaged; Bob Saggao and Harge Hayes ditto; Jim Laserman and Helen Ridgely the same. Bob Kodi just married Stella Regan. But enough of this. (And. ansrway. just on the edge of this to\vn of Pittsburgh is Bellevue. a delightful com­munity—with the loveliest people). 
Kelly had seen quite a few of his classmates. He says Joe LeStranse is working with him at Kemper Insurance out in Chicago. Joe is a proud papa. Also at Kemper's are F. P. Yockey and Don Horst of N. D. Law School fame. 
John Richards is in Marine Training School at Quantico. Chnck Gainer is with Standard Oil in Whiting. Ind. Hank Caudill, his convertible still running smoothly, is in South Bend working for Studebaker and spending his ofT-tlme at St. Mary's.' 
In answer to a question asked in some letters received—"When does the draft get you?" It draws nigh, gentlemen, it draws nigh! 
From Keesler Field. Miss., comes this word from FVt. Joe Okopien: *'I have been transferred twice since my arrival to Camp Grant. III., on May 16. I was first sent to Scott field. III., where I was stationed for two months with the 309th School Squadron. On Aug. 5. the squadron was transferred to Keesler Field. Miss. Since my arrival here I have been transferred to the 412th School Squadron, which is my present address. My rank at the present is still private second class, but I have high hopes when ratings are passed out next month. I'm very glad to hear that the "Scholastic" will be sent to boys in service. I am sure that all the boys in the service are anxious to hear from Notre Dame. At the present Keesler Field has no type of entertainment after duty hours since this field is new and just being built up. and I for one. would appreciate the "Scholastic." 
Another *41er who has begun army aviation cadet primary training is John Powera, at Wilson-Bonifils Flying School in Oklahoma. BUI Bogan, who was in the medical corps at Camp Lee, Va.. Fent word that he was leaving for Panama in October. 
BiU Spalding was the first cadet to arrive at the Chickashft flying school, Chiclcasha. Okla. Bill says that other Notre Dame students asked for admisdon into the same branch of service at the time he did last ^ring and that it may be that other Notre Dame men will be there in the first squadron. "If the others come, we would like to see the first squadron here named for Knnte Rockne,** Bill observed. v 
In a letter from Fort Bragg, N. C, Cliff Back­ley, says: "After my 13 weclcs intensive tzaining at Bragg in the communications section of the field artillery, I was appointed to Battery B as an instructor. Battery B is rather unusual in that it is comi>osed entirely of unfortunate men or never­had-a-chance men. They are men who are phya­cally discoordinated. illiterate, or possess no edu­cation whatever. This is interesting and definitely unusual work. Incidentally, I expect to be reward­ed with a corporal. rating about the time you receive this letter." 
George Ferridi, who is in the A. C. Base De­tachment, Biggs Field, Fort Bliss, Tex., writes: "I'm in the Base Detachment here at the west Texas border and we of the base have- as a job the maintenance of this comparativdy small but important field. Biggs Field is properly named be­cause it is mighty big—in importance. We have a sort of depot for planes flying Fast or West. Biggs handles more traffic for its size than any other field in the hemisphere. All of the bombers for Britain stop here for gas and service. We average 60 planes a day in and out. 
"I've been in four months now and am man­ager and bookkeeper for the Biggs Field Ex­change ; I'm slated to be the first man to leave Biggs for the A. G. Administrative Clerical School in two weeks. Rank is private now, but have hopes of a Ffc. this month." 
Pvt. John Ross writes that he has been shifted from Fort Niagara, N. Y., to Fort Eustis, Va., and from there to Camp Stewart, Ga. But' evi­dently John was moved again, for he wrote the letter from Fort Bragg, N. C John says: "I have none of the luxuries of life here, only the bare necessities. There are no lights, beds, nor wooden housing; just canvas tops and the floors of nature. If this life doesn't harden a man into a good soldier, then the future of America will be a problem to figure out. You will have to excuse the badly written letter, because it isn't too simple to write with a mosquito netting over your head and eyes." 
Ralph Trexler writes: "The *Alumnus* is my 
only connection with Notre Dame; Notre Dame 
men are scarce do^vn here on the Gulf Coast..I 
haven't seen a grad of '41 since I left South Bend 
last June. 
"There must be some N. D. men ainong the hundreds of service men who come doiwn from Fort Benning every week-end to enjoy our local recreation center. I wish they would look me up —my address is 1145 McKenzle Ave.. Panama City, Fla. Phone—1154. Incidentally, I'm a clerk in the control laboratory of the International Paper Company."

It is more than a coincidence that recent changes in federal income tax-laws offer an unusual opportunity to contribute to the support of privately-endowed colleges and universities. Gifts to these traditional guardians of -Ameri­can ideals are advantageous to the donor because of the tax deductions that he ob­tains. Now, more than ever before, these colleges and universities, functioning in an uncertain present and facing an even more uncertain future, are in need of funds that will protect them in their current operations and at the same time make provisions for needed progress. 
The period of unlimited national emer­gency has intensified a condition that has long been a concern to private colleges and universities. Dr. Robert MajTiard Hutchins, president of the University of Chicago, said recently that only through a multiplication of benefactors can pri­vate colleges hope to continue on their present levels. Dr. .Alan Valentine, presi­dent of the University of Rochestei*. sees private colleges facing financial ruin unless there is "greater support from those elements of society which value their services and appreciate the reasons for their continuance." 
Notre Dame's financial affairs differ not in kind, but somewhat in degree from those of most other private schools. For 99 years she has earned her own way, achieving her position among American universities with a minimum of means, with with a wealth of courage and perseverance. Only twice has she asked for aid — once in 1921 when the endowment fund was begun, and again about 10 years later when it was decided to build a memorial to the late Knute K. Rockne. Now, because Notre Dame must protect the scholastic gains that she has made, her affairs become the natural in­terest of her friends. 
Notre Dame's income from all inter­collegiate sports last year was less than $225,000. This sum is somewhat smaller than the amount of financial aid extend­ed by the Universitj' to about 800 stu­dents who without such assistance would have insufficient means to receive a col­lege education. 
Since 1842 more than 30,000 boys have received the sound training that is char­acteristic of Notre Dame. Today, on the threshold of her second century, Notre

Dame looks forward to even greater o))­portunities to serve the cause of true education — to teach men not only how to make a living, but also how to live. Thoughtful -Americans agree that there has never been a time when youth had greater need of guidance in accordance with the sound principles that are funda­mental at Notre Dame. 
The opportunity is there, waiting to be grasped. But Notre Dame cannot grasp it without the aid of her friends who believe, as she does, that tlie pur­pose of education is the development of the whole man, and who are willing to contribute to that cause. For further in­formation, alumni, their relatives and friends are asked to write to J. Arthur Haley, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Ind. 
tions to religious or educational institu­tions are deductible to the extent of 5 per cent of the taxable net income be­fore deduction of such contribution. Payment of the contribution, however, must actually 'be made during the tax­able year. 
Corporation tax rates vary from a minimum of 21 per cent to an approxi­mate maximum of 76 per cent, depend­ing upon the amount of income and the liability for excess profits taxes. 

The amount of saving in taxes resul­ing from a gift depends upon the maxi­mum rate of tax to which the particular corporation is subject. This rate is affected by so many factors that speciBc illustration is difficult. In general, it may be said that in years of substantial profits corporations can contribute to a privately-supported school like Notre Dame a non -proBt institution on a low net-cost basis.
