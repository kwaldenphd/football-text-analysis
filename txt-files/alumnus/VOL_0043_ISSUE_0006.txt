The first Alumni Workshop, January 13-14, 1965, promised you progress. This issue of the ALUMNUS magazine is a case history. 
The creation of the Edward Fred­erick Sorin Alumni Award for Dis­tinguished Service to the University is another. The story of that Award 


editorial 

and Father Hesburgh, its recipient, is part of this issue. 
The Science Centennial Awards— 30 prominent alumni and former faculty members recognized by the College of Science in its 100th yesr — 
mark a new depth alumni program. The shift to six full issues of the ALUMNUS on a regular schedule during 1966 will offer many advantages, talked about previously, now activated. Jim Cooney is facing the Club program with progress already breathing down his neck. The Science Centennial Awards in three Club cities mark one challenge. Another high-pressure first was the 20-Club use of closed circuit TV for the Michigan State game, on a week's notice. Most important, surveys from more than 100 Clubs will permit 
an analysis of present Club strength and weakness. (Ask your Club president if he sent in your Club survey—too many haven't.) The Foundation program is opening up two new alumni programs. One is the Annual Alumni Fund, under Dennis Troester, which will enlist the long-used (elsewhere) and effective Class Agent as a supplement to the existing alumni appeal channels of the Foundation. The other is the De­ferred Giving Agent, being organized in the Classes by Frank Kelly, to bring to Notre Dame the tremendous results of suc­cessful estate planning. These two programs will not involve any overemphasis on fund raising, but rather will bring new 
strength and identity to our Class organizations. 
On the campus, Jim Gibbons is working with campus Club and Class officers, projects which ^vill be reflected in stronger future Class structures, and in closer ties between Clubs and campus. 
Probably nothing looms larger in the alumni future than the new Kellogg Continuing Education Center. This new facility, under the forward-looking leadership of Dean Thomas Bergin, is not only a new buUding but the center of a new way of alumni life. 
These are not Old-Year-Out, New-Year-In gimmicks to be introduced with lights and noise and cheers, to attract a new market. I expect to be around a while. And I e.xpect the great programs that the Alumni Association has brought to Notre Dame to remain. 
But look for the new faces—Cooney, Thurin, Troester, Gibbons and Bergin in particular. And look for the new programs. Your Alumni Board (read and use your 1965 ballot) will provide informed, competent leadership.

CAMPUS: 

Long, Hot Fall 
Controversy as well as football filled the air at Notre Dame this fall as students, faculty members and administrators confronted issue s ranging from the war in far-off Viet Nam to unprovoked attacks on students in nearby South Bend. Two other matters also received consider­able attention on the campus and in the press: NCAA regulation of foot­ball telecasts and student behavior at football games at home and away. Contention: Campus debate on Amer­ican policies in Viet Nam culminated Oct. 16 in a marathon seminar in the Law Auditorium sponsored by the Academic Commission of Farley Hall. Thirteen speakers including Rep. William G. Bray of Indiana and severzd Notre Dame faculty mem­bers — Gerhart Niemeyer, Samuel Shapiro, James Bogle, Rev. Earl Johnson, OSB, and Rev. Peter Riga 
— presented varying shades of opin­ion ranging from unilateral with­drawal from Viet Nam to greater military action. As many as 150 stu­dents listened to the campus debate throughout the eleven-hour seminar. 
Subsequently, Father Riga and Dr. Joseph Duffy, Jr., of the English 


nrri 
department, announced plans to par­ticipate in a Nov. 27 "Peace March" in Washington, D. C, sponsored by the National Coordinating Commit­tee to End the War in Viet Nam. An undetermined number of Notre Dame students was expected to join them in the Thanksgiving weekend peaceful demonstration. 
At about the same time, a petition signed by 3,100 Notre Dame students expressing support of U. S. policy in Viet Nam and gratitude to the men of the armed services "for their self­less service there" was sent to Pres­ident Johnson and General WiUiam Westmoreland, commanding general of U. S. Forces in Viet Nam. One hundred twenty pages of signatures were gathered on the campus by members of the Young Republicans of Notre Dame and the Notre Djune chapter of the National Federation of Catholic College Students. Restraint: A matter closer to the campus, at least literally, was the

slashing of one Notre Dame student and attacks on several others by hoodlums within a few blocks of the University. At one point, about one thousand students began a protest march toward downtown South Bend, but they were persuaded to turn back at the edge of the campus by University oflBcials, seasoned stu­dent leaders and police. Within hours a student group led by Minchin Lewis, student-body president, met with South Bend Mayor Lloyd M. AUen and other ofBcials to discuss the threat to student safety and de­teriorating campus-community rela­tions. Two immediate results of those sessions: more city police as­signed to the area between the cam­pus and downtown South Bend and brighter street lighting to discourage nighttime hit-and-run assaults. 
Editorialized the South Bend Tribune: 

"We admire the students for their restraint in the moments of excite­ment and impatience to see a wrong righted. We compliment the student leaders for the role they have played in averting ugly incidents. And we compliment Mayor AUen and the Po­lice Depzirtment for their swift and positive response to the legitimate complaints." Settlement: For a time early in No­vember it appeared that WNDU-TV, the University station, would have to discontinue televising Notre Dame football games away and the sell­out contests at home. The NCAA withdrew permission for the tele­casts when it was found they were being rebroadcast in an unauthor­ized fashion by cable television sta­tions in central Indiana in violation of NCAA rules. The NCAA's posi­tion was that the cable TV pickups would adversely affect attendance at other Hoosier college football games. 
Rev. Edmund P. Joyce, CSC, Notre Dame executive vice-president and chairman of the faculty board in control of athletics, filed a letter of protest with the NCAA, enclosing statements from the president of Purdue University and the heads of other Hoosier institutions indicat­ing that the cable TV pickups were not hurting football attendance at their respective colleges. The Fed­eral Communications Commission also interceded in behalf of Notre Dame and WNDU-TV when its chairman, E. William Henry, urged the NCAA to reconsider its ban on the televising of certain Notre Dame home and away games. Shortly thereafter, the NCAA withdrew its ban and subsequently its program director, Asa Bushnell, authorized closed-circuit telecasts of the Mich­
ALUMNUS, NOVEMBER 1965 DECEMBER 
igan State game in twenty-one cities under the sponsorship of local Alum­ni dubs. "Alive and Bright": As the climactic clash between the Spartans and the Fighting Irish drew near and in the wake of the arrest of several Notre Dame students, including two re­serve football players, following the Purdue game, Notre Dame's presi­dent, Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, CSC, reminded the student body that "spirit is more than noise," that "it should not be confused with rowdi­ness, buffoonery, or inhospitality to opponents either." 
In a letter to the entire student body. Father Hesburgh warned "it is quite possible to ruin a very good thing called Notre Dame spirit. The net result will be not only a bad name for you and your University, but the end of intercollegiate com­petition here — because there is no reason for other universities to be­come involved with such nonsense, and those responsible here, students, faculty, and administration, are in­creasingly unwilling to continue on this course, even if it means elimi­nating what can be a very good and wholesome activity, as long as one remembers that it is, after aU, only a game, and this place is first and foremost a university." 
As the fall drew to a close. Father to think for themselves and be crit­ical. Controversy is not necessarily a bad thing, he said, and at a univer­sity it can be a very good thing. A university, especially a great univer­sity, is usually "a troublesome place," he concluded. 

Epilogue: Vatican II 
Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox and Jewish theologians and religious leaders from around the world will meet March 20-26 at Notre Dame to discuss the theological issues of Vatican n and their religious impact around the world. 
Twenty-four council fathers vriU present papers or preside at sessions of the parley, while non-Catholic scholars also will be included in the conference programs. The meeting wUl open in an ecumenical spirit, with a major Lutheran choir per­forming an oratorio for the initial assembly. Sessions wiU be concluded by an amalysis of scriptural passages by VEulous Catholic, Protestant and Jewish theologians. 
Bishop Mark McGrath CSC of Santiago de Veraguas, Panama, is the conference chairman, while Rev. Albert Schlitzer CSC, head of the Notre Dame theology department, acts as executive chaurman.

MIDDLE GROUND Where noise and hospitality met. 
Hesburgh, in an address to the Notre Dame President's Committee of South Bend, acknowledged that the early weeks of the academic year had been marked by controversy. But, he said, one must expect con­troversy — though not endorse ir­responsibility — when there are assembled on a campus faculty mem­bers who are intellectually alive and bright students who are being taught the new Center for Continuing Edu­cation on C2unpus, the conference sessions will be restricted to invited participants. Continuous translation facilities will allow foreign delegates to hear speakers in French £md German, as well as English. Closed-circuit television will carry the sessions to public audiences in the 3,000-seat Stepan Center across cam­pus.

Among the international figures attending the conference wiU be Rev. Karl Rahner SJ of Germany, Rev, Edward Schillebeeckx OP of the Netherlands, Rev. Yves Congar OP of France and Rev. John Courtney Murray SJ of the United States. 
THEATER: 

Today's Sir Thomas 
The age-old dilemma of maintain­ing one's conviction or of succumb­ing to the "ways of the majority," confronted Sir Thomas More in the 16th century during the reign of King Henry VUL In November it was rdived by the University Theater players in Robert Bolt's 
SIR THOMAS MORE A man for all seasons 

'"A Man for All Sezisons." And, there, in that most recent appear­ance, Sir Thomas became a fellow 20th century being. 
The setting hadn't changed; it was still in the 1500's. But its magnificent contemporary adaptation by the Englishman Bolt and its adept pro­duction by Father Harvey and his cast of 14 gave the audience the modem-day significance of Sir Thomas' unyielding love for truth and integrity. It was this no-com­promise love that entrapped More in a society which would not allow him to live his private convictions. 
Several outstanding individual per­formances brought the contempor­ary meaning into a serious, scholarly drama whidi previously had received overwhelming popular success on Broadway. Veteran theater per­former, Terry Francke, brilliantly portrayed the wit and wisdom of the lawyer-statesman, scholar-saint More. Ably enhancing the drama were AI Dunn as the Duke of Nor­folk, David Garrick who played 
Thomas Cromwell and Daniel Dig­gles as SignorChapuys. Yet, perhaps the greatest and the most pleasant discovery of new 
. talent was to be found in the person of freshmsm Michael Wingerter. His role was the Common Man, that indefatigable character who jumped from one role to another before the audience's eyes, playing evers^thing from Sir Thomas' Stewart to fore­man of the jury. It was he who bridged the gap between the Eliza­bethan age and our present time through his pragmatic humor. 
One critic penned the Common Man, "a gimmick" used to relate the story to the audience and to modern­ize it. But the same critic was quick to add that Wingerter's ". . . relaxed and colloquial delivery built a rap­port with the audience which only gradually revesiled the connection of the audience with the other, sup­posedly more noble, personages on stage." 
Next up in the University The­ater's season is "The Firebugs," a modem morality play. After that will come the spring musical, "How to Succeed in Business Without Really" Trying." 
ND-MSU: 

Closed-Circuit TV 
From the Syrian Mosque in Pitts­burgh to the Boston Garden to the Civic Auditorium in Omaha they watched Notre Daime and Michigan State in what had been hailed as the "game of the year." 
Close to 60,000 people clogged the Notre Dame stadium that November 
THE COAAMON AAAN A man with many parts 

20 afternoon, but an additional 49,­330 persons saw the game via closed-circuit television under the sponsor­ship of 20 Notre Dame Alumni Clubs ciround the country. 
It all began little more than a week before the game. The National Collegiate Athletic Association de­nied a request for commercial theater telecasts of the contest; a second request, for closed-circuit viewing sponsored by Alumni Clubs, was approved. 
Initiatl okay from Asa Bushnell, program director for the NCAA TV committee, covered telecasts in Boston, New York, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and Omaha. Sub­sequently, Jim Cooney, assistant Alumni secretary, contacted 20 other Alunmi Clubs in major metropolitEm areas, and an additional 19 smaller clubs voiced interest. 
E^ch club request other than the original five had to be specifically approved by the NCAA. Among those gaining permission and view­ing the closed-circuit telecast were: Buffalo, Cleveland, Providence, St. Paul, Detroit, Louisville and Des Moines. 
Proceeds from the telecast have been directed toward the Athletic and Convocation Center at Notre Dame and local club scholarship funds. 
ZIGGY: 

Retirement 
An era has come to a close at Notre Dame. Ziggy has retired. 
Since he came to the University's South Dining Hall in 1929, Zigmunt Kucharczuk has been identified with dining-hall cuisine and service. The name Ziggy meant all there was good and bad about a dining hall. 
When Ziggy first came to ND as a cook's helper, cleaning pots and pans, the campus as well as the dining hall was still in embryonic stages. "There was no stadium," he reflects, "and few trees, few build­ings. Meals used to be family-style, served almost like a banquet." 
Tlien the W£u: years brought a booming enrollment, and the dining hall fed 7,000 persons at each meal. "Had to convert a family-style to mass production. But the food was never really bad. With so many thousands to feed, for some excel­lent, for others horrible." 
But horrible or excellent, Ziggy 
_ is remembered by ND Alumni every­where. "I can't pass on the street in any city in the U.S. without some­one calling out, "Hey, Ziggy!' " 
AUJMNUS, NOVEMBER 1965 DECEMBEK 
ZIGGY 36 years without missing a day 
For Ziggy, some of the eventful, never-to-be-forgotten days during his tenure at the South Dining Hall would have to include the 1946 two-day student strike over the latter's refusal to use the traditionally mili­tary-styled trays. "Then, there was a time," recalls Ziggy, "that we had to serve a whole meal by candle­light" In more recent years he remembers the infamous "steak pa­rade," the day the dining hall switched to tenderized steaks. "I'll never forget it," sighed Ziggy. "They walked a line from the dining area tlirough the kitchen and down to the manager's office with steaks piled ten high. 
"But worst enemies and best friends come back and shake hEUids with Ziggy. The head of a big hos­pital says, 'What I am today, Ziggy made me.' You see, I'd get tough with him when he worked for me," 
Ziggy had many other well-knowns working in his dining hall during his 36 years there. In the earlier yeEU*s all the athletes had to work their way through school in the dining hall, and Ziggy can re­member a litany of football greats 
— including Rockne's last teams and Athletic Director Ed "Moose" Krause. J. Walter Kennedy, president of the National Basketball Associa­tion, washed dishes for four yesirs under Ziggy. Continuing Education De£in Thomas Bergin is a past Ziggy server and timekeeper. Another Zig­gy worker, now a Navy commander, said that half of his ND diploma belonged to Ziggy. 
He once fired a boy, not knowing then that he was University Presi­dent O'Hzira's nephew. When the student appealed to his unde, Father O'Hara said simply, "I know Ziggy and he knows what he's doing." 
Hie 36 years of work without afternoon. But, surrounded by the gifts of alumni and students, he feels at home. 
"There's just something about all the young people 1 fed over the years; you get tickled remembering it," Ziggy sighs. "Really, I belong to Notre Dame." 
And a part of Notre Dame always will belong to Ziggy.

The Melody Lingers on 
Eighty full years of life ended for John F. Shea October 24, but the song he helped create, the "Notre Dame Victory March," will live forever. 
It was in the fall of 1908 when John ('06 and '08) and his brother, the late Rev. Michael Shea ('04), wrote what has become the most widely known and often played col­lege football song. After football games with Indiana and Michigan, John sought a song for the ND rooters, one that would be theirs alone. Michael sat at a piano in Sorin Hall and composed a melody; three hours later, by "lights out" at 11, brother John had written the lyrics. 
From its first public playing on Easter Sunday, 1909, the song grew and spread throughout the world. Soldiers marched to it in war, ND graduates were married and laid to rest with its melody, and athletes have been inspired to greater heights by its spirit. 
John Shea moved into Massachu­setts state politics in 1921, winning election as state senator. He headed the senate's ways and means com­mittee and was a member of the 

poTPOum 

executive group controling the state Republican Party. He was an un­successful candidate for mayor of his native city, Holyoke, Mass., some years later, but did serve the city as chairman of the board of public works for a five-year term. He was a leader in civic Eiffairs throughout his life. 
On his death, the Holyoke Tran­script-Telegram wrote in an editor­ial, "He will be ever known for writ­ing the words of the 'Notre Dame Victory March,' now an American institution. 
"John Shea had a code of honor. He was proud of it and lived up to it."

THE 
,..^ SORIN 

AWARD 
ALUMNUS, NOVEMBER 19S5 DECEMBER 

T|^ROM its founding, the University of Notre Dame has enjoyed -*- its progress primarily through the unselfish services of genera­tions of devoted advocates. No one has ever surpassed the founder, Father Edward Sorin, in the depth and diversity of dedi­cation. No hours were too long. No task was too arduous. No travel was top tiring. No adversity was too formidable. For fifty years his example dominated the rich pages which he and his colleagues wrote in the history of education. From the kitchens of Notre Dame to the courts of France and the colonnades of St. Peter's he carried the conviction of his cause. And it prospered. 
IVrO W WITH the University in a continuing climate of un­
^ precedented academic prosperity, the alumni of Notre Dame wish to recognize those who follow in this great tradition. No other name seems more fitting to the Board of Directors of the Alumni Association as an identification for this alumni com­memoration than the name of Sorin. And no other recipient seems so appropriate to inaugurate this Award as a priest whose tall shadow shares the stature of Sorin; a priest to whom hours are no barrier in the day, who welcomes the challenges of new and arduous tasks, whose world travel is becoming legendary, whose overflowing agenda has allowed no time for adversity; a priest whose honors have come from Popes in Rome; a priest whose blueprints are always far ahead of his already impressive achievements; a priest whose dedication and whose unselfish service to Notre Dame continue to write new pages into the history of the University with the same illumination of leadership that marked the golden years of Sorin. 
Reverend Theodore Martin Hesburgh, G.S.C. 
Class of 1938 President of the University of Notre Dame from 1952 
ALUMNUS, NOVEMBER 1965 DECEMBER 
MAN AMONG PONTIFFS, presidents and emi­nent leaders. Father Hesburgh travels to meet them all most any time, most anywhere. In Vienna at the annual Conference of the Inter­national Atomic Energy Agency, Father Hes­burgh, the Vatican representative, confers with 
U.S.
 Delegate John A. McCone, far right, and members of the Russian delegation, the upper right. Other times he has been called to the White House as on the occasion of his appoint­ment by former President Eisenhower to the 

U.S.
 Civil Rights Commission, the presentation of the Laetare Medal to the late John F. Ken­nedy and, recently, on being awarded the Medal of Freedom by President Johnson. 


O
N October 21, Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh CSC became the first recipient of the Alumni Asso­ciation's newly created Sorin Award, named for Rev. Edward F. Sorin CSC, founder of the University. 
One hundred twenty-three years separate the founding of Notre Dame by its first President from this recognition of his successor, the 16th President. And yet, two words — vision and sendee — imite both eras and explain much of the intervening progress. 
Young Priests with a Vision. A young priest, 26 years old, stood in the November snows of 1842 and envi­sioned a University built aroimd the lake before him; a University he would dedicate to Our Lady. One hun­dred ten years later another priest, 36 years old, stood in the midst of a campus that already had far exceeded the original vision, and projected a new vision of Notre Dcune, one not only endowed with the rich heritage of the original, but also bearing the great strides in knowledge needed for the world's leaders to come. Both visions became actual fact because they were accompanied fay and implemented with a self-sacri­ficing concept of service. 
For a number of years, the Alumni Association through its Board of Directors has considered a na­tional award for distinguished service to Notre Dame. Because the award had to be truly meaningful in a world too filled with awards, great deliberation was called for. This year the Board agreed it had the proper ingredients: name, qualifications, and the first recipient. 
No Hours too Long. All who are familiar with the history of Notre Dame know of the inspiration of Father Sorin, of his dedication to the University, and of his 50 years of demanding, heroic service. No name so immediately creates in the minds of the Notre Dame family the image of sen'ice to the University as does that of Father Sorin. 
Service was obviously the first qualification con­sidered — service to Notre Dame. But, in addition, there was the challenge presented by the scope and diversity of the founder's record. Imagination, versa­tility, sacrifice, leadership, public relations, faith, con­sistency, physical stamina — all these were outstand­ing in Sorin, and, yet, were far from the total story.

SORIN AWARD 

But they did indicate the stature a recipient must have to stand beside the originsil. 
Because conviction and vitality were a part of the Sorin image, the Board did not allow itself to be handi­capped by an "all-virtue" concept, or the safe selec­tion of a "closed career" nominee. Immediately, to­day's University president. Father Hesburgh, loomed as the inevitable recipient. 
No Travel too Tiring. Young, imaginative, aggressive, modern — Father Hesburgh's record is already rich with those qualities that marked the foresight and the depths of Sorin. His stamina is written into the pas­senger lists of the airlines, as was Sorin's in the ships that ploughed the sea-lanes to and from Europe. 
An alumnus of Notre Dame's undergraduate school until studies took him to Rome for a degree, most of Father Hesburgh's life to date has been dedicated to his Alma Mater. The ALUMNUS has chronicled the accolades from education, science, the White House and the Vatican, which have marked Father Hesburgh as one of the great college presidents in an era of un­precedented notice for educational leaders. The honors

and the public esteem, the stature smd the influence he has brought to Notre Dame, and the developments he has encouraged on the Campus are as deep in their values as they are in their variety. 
Under the presidency of W. Lancaster Smith, the framed citation was presented to Father Hesburgh by Honorary Alumni President Philip J. Faccenda. A medal has been struck, 2md vrSl be the continuing sym­bol of the Sorin Award. 
In the future, candidates for the Sorin Award will be nominated — as are members of the Board — by a canvass of Club presidents. Class secretaries and for­mer members of the national Board, with individual alumni welcome to make nominations through these channels. 
Future recipients will be alumni of the undergradu­ate colleges of the University, graduate or nongrad­uate, and may be lay or religious. 
But in its creation and in the first recipient, the Board believes it has established a milestone in Alumni history. 
T
HE UNIVERSITY'S Centennial of Science in Novem­ber and December briefly turned away from the campus celebration to recognize alumni and former faculty members who have gained distinction on other scientific fronts. On fifty of them were conferred the Centennial of Science Award by the University's pres­ident. Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, CSC, "for great distinction in the fields of scientific research, education, management and technology." 
The presentation of the lucite pyramidal com­memorative award to its recipients at dinners across the country is one of the yearlong series of special events, lectures and exhibits marking one hundred years of science education and research at Notre Dame. 
Notre Dame's College of Science has been recog­nized for its "firsts" on many occasions in association with such names as Nieuwland, Zahm, Kirsch, Wen­ninger, Reyniers and others. Nevertheless, a university receives its academic reputation in large part on the quality and achievements of the students who pass through its gates. 
At the announcement of the awards, Professor Milton Burton, chairman of the Centennial Committee, said, "The College of Science feels that its alumni may proudly compare themselves with those of other ex­cellent institutions; the awards are a token of this realization.

"There are many outstanding alumni of the College of Science," continued Burton, "so many that a rather stringent criterion was applied in order to keep the number of awards within bounds. This high selectivity, of course, has made the award much more significant. In most cases the recipients are persons of wide na­tional and international reputation." 
The principal celebration of the Centennial of Science took place May 15 when twelve eminent figures in the world of science, seven of them Nobel Prize winners, received honorary degrees at a special Notre Dame convocation. The centennial observance concluded in early December when scholars from ten

universities participated in a symposium on "Science and Contemporary Society." 
As it begins its second century of teaching and research, Notre Dame's College of Science is headed by Dean Frederick D. Rossini who earlier in this centennial year received the University's highest honor, the Laetare Medal. Dean Rossini, who is also chairman of the University Research Council, co­ordinates the work of the departments of biology, chemistry, geology, mathematics, physics and pre­professional studies as well as that of the Lobund Laboratory and Radiation Laboratory.

CARNEY AND ALUMNI BOARD: a time and place for the "old guard" to meet the "new breed." 
STUDENTS, ACADEMICS and ADMISSIONS 
The occasion was the fall board meeting of the Notre Dame Alumni Association. Lawyers, industrialists, a retired professor and a doctor formed the 13-man group who, in addition to directing the affairs of the Association, advise the adminis­tration on university-related matters through resolutions of approval or disapproval, and recommendations of particular courses of action. 
On the agenda was a wide range of University activity. But most pre­meeting thoughts were trained on the series of incidents that brought national attention to the University in the fall. (Sse story, page 2.) 
The weekend passed and the board concluded its fact-finding tour that resulted in only one major reso­lution— that a letter of commenda­tion be sent to the student body president — while other recent and more spectacular developments in the admissions and academic fields far overshadowed any pre-meeting concerns. 
Sef No Precedent: Today's Notre Dame student body and their con­duct this fall prompted a barrage of questions that jarred the smooth, pleasant air that had settled follow­ing the meeting's opening. The board listened as Dr. Bert Coughlin, chcur­man of the committee for student affairs, rdated his earlier discussions with students and Fathers; McCar­ragher and Simons. 
The answers were simple but com­plete. 
In one case the woeful behavior of less than a handful of students pro­voked an incident after the Purdue game that hit all wire services. This was nothing new to the board. De­plorable as it was, it, nevertheless, had set no precedent. 
But another occasion that gained equally wide coverage only tended to bolster the confidence of the board, as it would any alumnus, in the char­acter and strength of the today's Notre Dame student. Carefully re­lating the sequence of the week-long campus-South Bend crisis, prompted by several knifings of ND students, Chairman Coughlin told of the ma-lure student leadership that emerged and reasoned the way out of what might have been a critical commu­nity confrontation. 
Still, a third matter needed ex­planation, the October 16 Viet Nam "teach-in." Early in the week of the campus event, the situation ap­peared explosive with many mem­bers of the administration and some students showing an uneasiness over the proposed seminar. It coincided, unfortunately, with a nationwide anti-Viet Nam campaign. In the main, however, this was not in­tended. Rather, it was the only non­footbEdl Saturday its promoters could schedule the 11-hour affair. After all Wcis said and done, the record marathon — featuring prominent campus and off-campus opinionators of U.S. Viet Nam policy — was truly academic in motive and in reality. 
The affairs of the student body were put aside by the boEu-d there­after, but not before a resolution was approved commending the stu­dent leaders whose cool and effective handling of the South Bend attacks helped solidify campus-town rela­tions. A letter was so prepared and sent to the student body president. 
The same day-long meeting pro­vided an insight into future academic plans that may prove far more last­ing and perhaps even more exciting than the tense moments this fall. 
On the Rise: Rev. John Walsh CSC, together with Dr. Thomas Stewart and Leo Corbaci talked about the University's academic growth with particular emphasis on the expand­ing Graduate School programs. Within the next two years Alumni will see master and doctoral pro­grams formed in most departments while Graduate School enrollment will probably exceed 1,000 full-time students exclusive of the Law School. 
One such expansion will be the development of a Graduate School of Theology beginning in the fall of 1967. Open to the lay as well as the religious, the Theology School will concentrate on pastoral, ecumenical and liturgical theology. 
"The graduate program on the Notre Dame campus, however, may be expanded well beyond those visions," according to Dr. Thomas Stewart, associate vice-president for academic affairs, "particularly if po­litical winds favor the University." Dr. Stewart revealed that the State of Indiana is considering Notre Dame's invitation to locate a state-

financed and state-operated medical school on the campus. If approved, and decision should be forthcoming in June 1966, the school might con­ceivably be called the State of In­diana Medical School at Notre Dame. For the University, such an appoint­ment would enhance the academic climate, thus attracting more quali­fied faculty to Notre Dame. 
More than Scores: Equally as uplift­ing were the views from the new director of admissions. Brother Raphael Wilson CSC, who imme­diately and unhesitatingly registered his concern over admission standards that are set exclusively by entrance exam scores and high school class rankings. Brother Raphael went on to say, "I would like to see more re­cruiting than screening in finding the boy who will be the most responsive to what Notre Dame has to offer. In this way we can be more zissured of accepting the boys whom we can help make the leaders of tomorrow." 
The financial aid program accord­ing to Brother Raphael hasn't changed considerably although the picture will improve once the federal aid to students program is put in motion. Within this area Brother strongly favors the availability of loans which he feels instill a respect within the individual for the educa­tion he is receiving. 
A New President: Covering almost all aspects on the agenda, the board concluded its oflBcial business with the election of a new Alumni Asso­ciation president. He is Thomas P. Carney, '37, vice-president of G. D. Searle and Co. in Chicago, who will assume his presidential duties in January at the winter meeting of the Association. 
Also assuming positions on the Alumni Board in January are four new members to be elected by the Association. They will replace PhiUip 
J. Faccenda '51, Morton R. Good­man '30, George A. BarisciUo Jr. '44 and Paul I. Fenlon '19 who have completed their three-year terms. 
The ballot, containing the names of eight nominees, was mailed to aU alumni in early December. Voting will close January 1, 1966. The nominees are: William G. Burkhardt '35 from Akron; Paul Fullmer '55 from Chicago; James C. Hennessy '52 from Louisville; William D. Kavanaugh '27 from Washington; William F. Kerwin Jr. '40 from Green Bay; Frank L. McGinn '52 from Pompano Beach, Fla.; Richard 
A. Rosenthal '54 from South Bend; Leo V. Turgeon Jr. '42 from Los Angeles.

At our Fall Alumni Board Meeting, we presented to Father Hesburgh the first Sorin Award for distinguished service to Notre Dame. In accepting, Father Hesburgh revealed the advice Father John Cavanaugh gave him on receiving his first administrative position, 
Hoio loell you do vnll depend upon Iww mitch you receive from others . . . arid . . . don't take yourself too seriously. 
As you would e.xpect, he tried to pass on the Sorin Award 
honor to the members of his team and the faculty. But this was a 
personal honor for personal accomplishment. He has taken his many talents and doubled his Master's gifts. 
WITH HIS GIFT OF CHARITY .. .he pre­sented roses to the ill loife of a Russian sci­entist loho ivas a member of the Russian del­egation to the International Atomic Energy Agency. There followed tlie first conversa­tion between the Russian and the priest representing the Vatican. Subsequently, an­other Russian visited Notre Dame's Sacred Heart Church, and was led around the base­ment altar by Father Hesburgh as he said Mass and explained to the Russian the wording of the Latin Rite. This year in To­kyo, both the Russian and the Vatican dele­gations voted for wider inspection and con­trol of the bomb material residting from nuclear power reactors throughout the world. 
WITH HIS GIFT OF BROTHERHOOD . . . he advised two Notre Dame students they coidd only remain at Notre Dame if they convinced the Jeioish studetit and his par­e)its that their slanderous, anti-Semitic defacing of the Jewish student's room teas a7i isolated, deplorable act, totally unrelated to the spirit of Notre Dame, and if they per­suaded the Jewish family that their son be­longed at Notre Dame. They traveled across country at their oion expense to plead loith the family ... and returned with their Notre Dame brother. 
WITH HIS GIFT OF VALUE . . . he left Washington after several days of meetings for South Bend, but routed his return to visit two Notre Dame students who were badly injured in an autonwbile accident, and to comfort their parents. 
To all of his tasks. Father Hesburgh brings an effort typical 
of that expended on Cartier Field. You know of the unprecedented academic and physical growth at Notre Dame. At the expense of surprise and embarrassment to Father Hesburgh, I thought you would appreciate a touch of the personal. 
We know not what mountains he has to climb, or streams to 
ford. We can only hope the words of Robert Frost are his 
prophecy. The woods are lovely, dark and deep. But I have promises to keep. And viiles to go before I sleep. And miles to go before I sleep. Sincerely, LANCASTER SMITH '50 President

CLUBS 
An Oct. 5 smoker attracted members witli raffle prizes being four of those hard-to-get tickets for the Army game on Oct. 9. To console those who didn't win the tickets, the highlights of the 19M KD season were shown. 
Chicago 
President PAT SHANNON' got the first event of his administration off to a ver\- successful start. Our annual Golf Outing was held on Aug. 2, at the Elmhurst Country Club. 
Golf Outing Chairman TON\' GIROLAMI con­tinued the tradition of keeping this affair one of the summer's most outstanding events. Some 200 golfers cliascd little white balls through the woods and across the waters of that challenging course. Tlien an overflow crowd of 357 enjoyed a delicious roast beef dinner. 
Co-Chairman JOE RIGAU JR. saw to it that everything went off as sclicdulcd. Film lughlighu of the 19&+ football season provided an interesting pastime for non-golfers throughout the afternoon. 
Father Joyce, Moose Krausc. Coacli Parscghian and the rest of the coadiing stafT journeyed in from the Campus to add to the day*s cnjo>-mcnt. Coacli Parscghian, after shooting a sharp game of golf, was the featured speaker after dinner. He gave a position by position rundown of the 1965 team. Assistant Coacli Tom Pagna, a likely candidate for the "Tonitc Show," kept the assemblage lauglitng with a wide x'oricty of impersonations. 
TOM ^VALSH JR. '58 was the trophy winner for the second year in a row with the low gross score for the day, a 75. A fine array of door prizes were given to most of those who attended. Our special thanks go to Col, Fred Snitc of Elm­hurst Country Club for making tlic Golf Outing a success. 
I feel tliat I speak for all members of the Chicago Club when I pay tribute to our immediate past president, PAUL FULLMER, for the outstanding job he has done during liis term as president. The time and energy he expended in the performance of his duties would be impossible to measure. But, because of his tireless efforts the Club enjoyed ils most successful vear. His selection of strong chair­men—PAT SHANNON (Rockne Night), JACK THORNTON and WALT ROGERS (Communion Breakfast), TOM HAYES (Freshman ScndofT), JLM RYTHER and AL HANEY (Golf Outing) and ED MORAN (Universal Notre Dame Night) resulted in peak attendance and excellent program­ing for these e\*ents. Paul can be especially proud of the $2500 turned over to the Scliolarship Foundation in the Club's name as a part of the Club's Scholarship Program. Congratulations on a job well done, Paul. Without your fine organiza­tional abilities, all this would not have been accomplished. 
Chairman TOM HAYES sclieduled the annual Freshman ScndofT for Sept. 13, in the Lakeside Room at McCormick Place. The incoming frosh, their fathers and mothers, were welcomed to the ND family. An interesting prenew of what the freshmen could expect upon their arrix'al was given by JIM GIBBONS '53, assistant director of public relations at ND. 
Last year's Oktoberfest Partv was a smashing success and this year PAT PHELi\N, KEVIN BURKE and JOHN FANNON chainnanncd an even bigger party. The necessary ingredients for this recipe were beer, bratwurst, a German Oom-pah band and the atmosphere of a German beer garden. Add to this 700 Chicago area Irishmen anxiously awaiting the start of another football season and you had the makings of a most enjo>*3blc evening. It was held at the Germania Club on Sept. II and the committee managed to keep the cost down to $1 per person. 
Extensive plans were made for this year's Rockne Night which was held on Dec 6 in the Grand Ballroom of the Sherman Hotel. We all celebrated the conclusion of another successful football cam­paign. Terry Brennan was present as our guest speaker. Chicago area members of the 1965 Foot­ball Team were also honored. 
Both sides of a long-standing rivalry* met Oct. 1 when the ND Club of Chicago held a football luncheon with the Northwestern Men's Club the day before tlie Irish met the Wildcats in South Bend. 
The shillelagh trophy, s>mbol of the ND-North­westem football conflicts since 1930, was on display at the luncheon, and spirits were whipped up by Stu Holcomb from Northwestern and Coach Tom Pagna from ND.

Tlie Second Annual Notre Dame Midwest Family Fcsti\'al at Cedar Point was held this year during the second week of July. Fifty-seven Alumni and their families were present for the entire week­end. In addition, 80 familcs visited the Point over the weekend, bringing the grand total for the week­end to 526 people. Tlic attendance this year u'as up approximately 30 per cent over last year's event. Chairman DICK MILLER is to be com­mended for his expert handling of the weekend activities which included a golf outing, hospitality room accommodations, and a buffet dinner. FATHER THORN'TON offered the Rockne ^femo^ial Mass at the conclusion of the three-day outing. 
GEORGE KERVER again chairmanned the ever-popular husband and wife weekend retreat held on the Campus this past .August. As in past years, a full Iiouse was present to enjoy a spiritual honej'moon. 
Although tlie weather dampened the ground, the spirits of the members and families who attended the Family Picnic at Gilmour were not affected. An unusuallv fine program was offered by Chair­men JOHN HU'MMER and JIM C.\NNY, including svrimming, baseball, children's games and prizes and refreshments. For those members who have families and who have never had the opportunity to attend this picnic, I urge that you put this affair on your calendar for next summer. 
CREIGHTON MILLER is apparently becoming the perennial golf champion as evidenced by his low score at this year's annual golf outing held at the Hawthorne Valley Countrv Club, Aug. 30. Chair­men DICK VAN AUKEN and GUS STEFANEK again offered a day of good weather, excellent golfing farilitics, outstanding food, and lous>' golf scores. Hon. Chairman HUGH M. O'NEILL and Assistant to the Chairman JOHN P. CHAPL.\ would like to express their thanks to the members for their donating of prizes for the golf banquet.

Although our monthly meetings arc somewhat 
curtailed in the summer, a very well attended meet> 
ing was held at BILL DOSMANN's house in June. 
Resulting from Bill's policies as our new president, 
the meeting almost started on time. BILL DE

usual refreshments and card games. 
The annual picnic was a huge success again at

The untimely death of beloved TIM HALLIG.^N on Aug. 28 was a great shock and a tremendous loss to the University and to the ND Club of Flint. Tim was appointed by FATHER HESBURGH as chairman for this district for the Cliallenge I Pro­gram. In three years Tim exceeded his quota by 200 per cent. 
Members of the Club attended the rosary .\ug. 29 and 30, and the funeral Mass Aug. 31.

JOHX RILEY III, and ROLAXD DcCOTEAU wth

We were sony- that REV. LEOXARD COLLI.XS 
CSC could not have been with us since he was 
ordered to X'ew Orleans as director of the new Holy 
Cross Seminar>' so we missed this contact Arith the 
L^nivcrsity. But \vc were pleased that our small group 
was able to make an announcement that its scholar­
ship fund to date has paid out 54.430 in •cholaiship 
loan money to various boj-s attending the University 
over the past several years. \ loan of $500 was 
awarded to Vincent Allen for the coming year to 
help him finish his education at XD. 
Since we meet so seldom, due to the scattering of 
our alumni around a large state, we were pleased 
that so many attended and that our efforts on behalf 
of the scliolarship fund liave set us up as a good 
example of a club tliat is active, not only socially, 
but in a way that fulfills the purpose of a XD Club.

The Annual Golf Outing was held July 27 at the West Bend Countrv Club with co-cliairmen TOM MULCAHY and BOB ROLFS in charge. The "Sportiest Course in Wisconsin." as it ^^'as billed, did cause trouble for most of the golfers. A hot day, together with high winds and big mosquitoes, proved too much for most. 
The 60 members and guests heard Dave .^damson 
named as low gross for the day with a beautiful 72. 
Xew officers for the 1965-1966 season were nomi­nated and dulv elected. Thcv arc: President JOHX SCHLOEGEL.- Vice-President D.AVE MURPHY, Treasurer RICH.ARD EHR and Secretar%- XED BALDUS.

New Orleans 
On Aug. 31, at the Metairie Countr>' Club, the XD Club of Xew Orleans gave its annual cocktail party honoring the present Xew Orleans area students and their parents. Over 100 loi-al souls turned out. for this enjo>-able evening and it is hoped that this signals the renaissance of our Club. 
The highlight of the evening was the film of the 1954 season. The film ran perfectly until the last two minutes when a convenient break occurred. Wc assume that whoever used the film before us u'os an amateur editor who made excellent use of his scissors on the So. Cal. portion. 
During our pleasant social, BILL DREUX, chair­man of the nominations committee, snuck in a new slate of officers. In due course, these men were *'dcmocraticalIy elected,'' but a low murmur from the back of the ballroom seemed to liken Bill to a railroad engineer. 
The slate of newlv-elected officers consisted of: ED SPORL JR. '34, president; PAUL HURLEY '56, \ice-president; JIM CARRIERE '62, secretary; and DUXCAX SAUSAY '62, treasurer. 
A buffet luncheon was coupled with the telecast 
of the Southern California game. Like last year's 
turnout for the Michigan State game, there was a 
good crowd eating, drinking. \%'atching, and getting 
revenge.

Northern New Jersey 
Over 150 Alumni and guests partici|>ated in the Club's annual golf outing June 22. Some ^iio haven't been in our midst for quite some time were there including HARRY 0'.ME/\LIA '43 and BILL TOBIX's best friend CHIXK HOG.-\.V '42 (Ridgc­wood's busiest dentist.) JOEY M.-\RRAXCA '41, controller for Arris & Co., construction, came for dinner with his two old pals, S.-\L LA PILUSA and TONY ROMEO, both '4Iers. Sal has been on the Medical .Adrisor^- Board of X.J. Cerebral Palsy for over 10 years. DOX ROMEO '64, Tony's son, is Eer\'ing in the Anny Finance Corps in the Chicago area. LARRY DOYLE was there but his younger brother took the honors this time. JACK PIXDAR '40 was there with his friend WALT COXXELL as were the two industrialists of northern X'ew Jcrecy, AXGE BERTELLI '44 and FIUXK TRIPUCKA '49. DOX LUSARDI, one of Frank's bosses, came without his brother PETE LUSARDI, who probably was lining up some .Army game tickets for Oct. 9. BRUCE DOLD was chainnan uith GEXE DEAX doing his usually masterful job. ED VOX' HOEHXE won a prize for the most offspring— 10 of them. Imagine! JIM SEBOLD, our new prexy who took over from HARRY DURKIX', won a prize but not for liaving children. GEXE AXGIULLI from Clifton was another of the faithful to make the outing.

BILL KIRCHXER won a prize for the most proficient golfer and HARRY DURKIX, applause for two years of Herculean effort. 
The annual Freshman Sendoff was held at the Military Park Hotel on Sept. 7. This was the initial function for the new year and, as before, was a great success. JIM SEBOLD '50, club presi­dent, introduced JAMES GIBBOXS, assl. director of p'jblic relations at XD, as the principal speaker of the evening. His talk u-as aimed at answering any questions from the 55 incoming freshmen and their fathers. In addition, to help the new students get a clearer picture of wliat to expect during their first year —and where to go if they have any trouble — he gave a pretty complete run-down on what the University offers the freshmen In the way of counseling in academic affairs. 
Xcxt, it was time for the lighter side of campus life. JOHX GRUX'THER '66 and BRIAN* CON­NELLY '66, president and vice-president, respec­tively, of the Xew Jcrse>' Club on Campus at ND passed on the vital social information for freshmen during orientation week and the plans for the rest of the sdiool year. 
Finally, the program was adjourned to the refresh­ment tabic and the many Alumni who were present— ANGELO A^fATO '42, HEXRY BORDA '39, JACK PI.XDAR '40, BOB JOYCE '50, HARRY DURKIX '53, CHARLES Mc^L\HON '53, AXGELO BERTELLI '44, FRAXK TRIPUCKA '49, BILL CROSBY '61.

the questions tliat only a freshman could ask. Ele\-ator passes anyone? —JACK FI^\NAGAN *58, Secretary 
Northland 
It has never been quite clear to me what the 
qualifications have been for the establishment of a 
X'otre Dame Club. For nearly 40 years we in the 
upper peninsula of Michigan, southern tip, have 
enjoyed a Club under the name of Hiawathaland. 
The area was verj- great and not conducive to large 
gatherings, but of course, the upper peninsula is 
sparsely populated. Unfortunately there is not much 
industry or business expansion because of this, and 
there is little to attract new graduates unless they 
return to their home operation or practice. 
In recent years it has been difficult to continue 
Hiau-athaland Club and since .ibout 15 to 20 of the 
Club lived in or near the twin cities of Marinette, 
Wis., and Menominee. Mich., we had decided to 
fonn our own Club, which wc did two ycrars ago 
under the new name of Notre Dame Club of 
the X'orthland. 
At our annual Universal Xoire Dame Night 
meeting it u'os detennined to hold a Corporate 
Communion of Club members and their families on 
.Aug. 15. Several of the old Hiawathaland Club 
members also attended. 
Our next meeting will probably be held on Jan. 
25, 1966, at Iron Mountain, Mich. 
As for personals of our cbss, TOM PLOUFF '23 
will retire next month as vice-president and general 
manager of .Ansul International, though he will 
continue in an advisorv capacitv.

Cock­taik and a delicious steak dinner followed the golf tournament with HUGH DEVORE as our honored guest and speaker for the evening. Along with some typically humorous Dcvore stories, we received a fine resume of offensive and defensive stand-outs on the '65 football squad. Attendance prizes were given at the end of the evening. JOHN PHELAN '56 came away with top prize—a weekend trip for him and his wife to the Lodge of the Four Seasons in the Ozarks. Our thanks to HANK LUEPKE for arranging for Hugh Devore's visit, a fine dinner, and a lot of wonderful prizes. 
Freshman Night was held at the home of Gene 
Fchlig '43. The officers and board of directors en­
tertained the 22 incoming freshmen and their 
fathers. The formal program consisted of the Notre 
Dame film followed by a general question and an­
swer period on campus life and requirements. The 
rest of the evening was verv- casual and enabled 
everyone to become better acquainted. This is one 
class that will leave for South Bend with a very 
fine impression of the girls "across the Dutie." The 
reason? Mrs. Gene Fehlig (formerly Jick Jacoby, 
SMC '43), Kathy and Karen, Gene's daughters, and

I am pleased to be able to report tliat out of 56 members of the Class of 1915 (for whom we have current addresses) IG were in attendance at the Golden Jubilee Reunion in June.

Drove down to the University with FRANK X. RYDZEWSKI and JOHN V. VOELKERS for the ^[onogram Dinner. Visited the Holy Cross House and w ^ lucky to get some prctt>' good pictures, thanks to REV. JOHN P. LYNCH '25 CSC. Our group picture was of Holy Cross Fathers MILTNER, H.\GERTY, SCHU.MACHER and LYNCH. It also included JIM RYAN '20, AL. SO.MMER '25, VOELKERS '18 and "BIG FRANK" RYDZEW­SKI '18. Missed getting FR. FINNEGAN in the picture. Understand he was resting. Everyone looked to be enjoying the best of health and you can believe me that wc really had a real good "OIc Time Bull Session". The story was repeated about the canoe trip Fr. Hagerty was invited on by WALTER MILLER. It was planned for the St. Joe River. But Pilot Miller landed Fr. Hagerty in Chicago with but one sandwich and broke. They managed to "bum" their way back on a coal car, arriving at 2 AM. That's not all. Fr. Hagerty had to say Mass at 5 A^L AVondering no\v- if Walter succeeded in passing Fr. Hagerty*s clas5 that semester? Then the tale about the time the Polish people of South Bend had a party /or their hero "Big Frank.'' .As was the custom, a collection of considerable amount was taken. When presented to R\-dzewskt by his classmates on the Campus, they presented him with the pot but it was full of toilet paper. You could pull a stunt like that on "Big Frank" because we all agreed that his heart is as big as his head. 
A lot was said about the time BUTCH WHIPPLE imitated the return of a classmate by wallung around the campus with a puppy at the end of a huge rope, a broom handle as a swagger stick under his arm and dressed in garb borrowed from BRO. HUGH. You can believe us, we had an enjoyable couple of hours at Holy Cross House. Wc would ap­preciate hearing from someone about "ROCK" and his marble champ. Also, about the Hill St. car burning. Perhaps, you were one that got your ice cream at **lights out" through the door transom. What about some of your "skiving" stunts? Write please. 
Called on FATHER DOREMUS who looks great and reports he is feeling fine. Got a good picture of Fr. "D " and Voelkers on the porch of Corby Hall where Father stays, the same porch **King-Cap" FATHER FARLEY used to "pitch" the man to you. Remember? If there was a perfumed one — OH BOY—the "guy" was in for a ribbing. A cookie package—wicll, it generally was "finished-ofT' before one could return with any left to hide in his 
bunk. Upon one's return to the campus you again 
relive those "way-back-when" da>-5. 
Never knew that John V. Voelkers spent seven years at Holy Cross Seminary. But walking around the campus with John you begin to realize that this guy must know every blade of grass. 
After ^(onogram Dinner we three—^Voelkers, *'Big F." and I—returned home admitting that wc had a most enjo>-able time and, if **the Good Lord u-illing," we would be back next year. Saw and talked with some of the "Ole Timers", all looking great, enjoying good health and appearing well and able to **rub" a couple of dimes together. The oldest, if I am correct, and looking keen was HAS O'CONNOR '05, track and basebaU. 
OASSES 
Returned Saturday to attend the .\nnual .-Mumni Banquet. Stopped at the Cafeteria for hinch and shared a table with FR. JOHN REDDINGTON '23 who is up for retirement. Tried to locate "HEIXIE" BERGER '15 but learned that he had checked out. I'll see the "guy" c\xn though I have to drive to Sturgis, Mich, to go over some of the Corhy Hall Subway stories. At tlic banquet Saturday with tlic 1920 dass, I took some picture: of JOHN BALFE, WALTER MILLER, SLIP ^LADIG.•\^^ LEX CMX, JIM TRANT and ^L^URICE THORNTON'. The place was packed and cver>-one present got a spiritual lift cat of being there and hearing President HESBURGH'S address. One leaves witli a spring in his step, pro'jd tliat he is a N*D man. Learned what huge plans arc in store for N'D. Honestly, \-ou should begin now to look forward to returning for >-our Golden Jubilee. You'll return home admitting to >*ourself tliat it was worthwhile and pleased you returned to the campus. 
Undersund that FR. CHAS. J. WILLIAMS could not arrange for a summer \*acation or attend commencement this year. However. Father has ob­tained some football tickets for the Ranioul, 111. Knights of Columbus and hopes to sec a couple of games. Tlie candle still bums on the passing of VLVCENT C. GIBLIN LLB M8. The slor>- is that *'ROCK'' told him to go ahead and defend Caponc. Tlianks to "Te.\as" BILL GRADV M7 for sending me his 1914 Dome, Bill is looking great. Heard from L.\MBERT "BERT" Q. SENG *18. Wrote BERT that I heard over radio that SHERWOOD DIXON was b'tsy around Dixon, 111. giving out au-ards. FR. HOLDERITH (wiio is looking great) also gave out awards at the Alumni Dinner to the golf uinners. 
No reports or word from many of you ' I8*ers. That guy M.\X KAZUS doesn't need the stamps. If Ma.x doesn't come across soon with some **chit­chat" rU have BILL BRADBURY send him a summons. Want to thank track star EDWARD J. McOSKER Ph B Journ '17 for his card. Also thanks to JAMES T. Mc^L\HON LLB *17 and WM. H. KELLEY LLB '18 from Da>-tona Beach, Fla. Wondering if Bill moved there or just \-aca­
tioning? Word also from JOHN L. REUSS LLB M8 and J.AMES L. SWEENEY '18. Like to hear from Jim, that wc might let a\RLETON DIETZ BEH know, if he is still "tossing dirt" Sunday? Then there is this "guy" MORRIE ST.ARRETT now re­tired. He really should write and give us the dope on tlic West Coast ND men. S-ire would like to have a report on the hurdler FR:\NK M. KIRK­LAND LLB '17. Our past president. JOHN A. LEMMER Ph.B. '18, should let ns hear from him. Judge Ernie S. Burke, Countv BIdg.. Indianapolis is the son of E. J. "STUFFIE" BURKE '18 the left-handed first baseman. 
Want to thank NORRIE STARRETT for his card sent from Port Townsend, Wash. BILL GRj\DY sends a card stating that he and ilis. on their way to N.M. taking in the quarter horse rac e Bill admits tliat he didn't tell me of the loss of his son Bill Jr. June 21. 'The only thing one can say was that—in tills case the LORD was good; as, he was suffering great pain—and to prolong it would not have helped him or those left behind". FR. CH.AS. 
J. WILLIAMS sent a note frtim St. Mahchy's Rec­tory- stating he is ready with 35 local K of C. members for the ND-Mich. St. game. Know that we all arc trusting Fr. W. and party will have a great time. Hope it will be a ball for *em all. 
Hey 18'crs! 

Let's hear from \-ou, direct or olhcrwise! Gotia have some interesting "Stuff' for the next ALUM­NUS. 
1968 is not too far away. Start planning now to return. Remember the motto given us by "DOC" NIGRO '17: Salute Cento Ans—Good Health for 100 Years. That's all for this time. Sec you for sure in 1968.

The July-August issue of the Alumnus contained a nice paragraph reporting on the marriage of my son, Phil '63, who is no^^* in his last year at the N*D Law School. This item dcser\es some expansion. The bride is Colleen Murray, who comes from Key Biscayne, Fla. Colleen was graduated from St. Mary's t^vo years ago and Is working at Fides Pub­lishing House at Notre Dame. I simply want to point out how evcr>* once in a while a man hits the jackpot. I would have been satisfied to have a son graduate from Notre Dame and study law there but to get a pretty, charming St. Mary's girl as well, makes everything perfect. 
While in Key BIsca>Tic for the August wedding I learned that I. I. PROBST '26 lives on the isbnd. He has been in Florida for several years and is doing well in the insurance adjustment business. We got together for breakfast one day and exchanged bits of information concerning our former classmates. 
Perhaps it is really too early to bring up the sub­ject, but I do want to remind you that our next class reunion will be held a year from this coming June. I hope it will be as successful as former ones have been.

Your class secretary- has been a bit on the inactive side this past year due to pressure of business and a dearth of news from many who \-aliantly support me with correspondence from time to time. Living on the West Coast has many advantages and ainnail takes just a day longer to reach inc than it did when I lived in Chicago. Your help is needed and rcqucstcd-
Several of our classmates have been called to their eternal rewards and I have also been touched in my own family with the death of my brother. WILLIAM E. DOYLE'34. Some of you who attended that wonderful reunion in Morriszey Hall in 1941 may remember him as one of the (wo soldiers who were our guests tliat weekend. Bill suffered a sudden heart seizure near his home Jn Mihraukcc, May 6th. He is survived by his widow, Marie, and a son, Micliael, who is studWng for the priesthood at the seminary for the Milwaukee diocese. 
Attending his funeral were two of niv close class­mates, EDDIE RYAN and GIL SE.\MAN, both witit whom I spent lime during the week I spent in Chicago. On Sunday, June 27, I had a phone call from RAY COLLINS \vhom I had aho seen while in the East, telling ine of the sudden death of GILBERT SEAMAN. Gil had a heart histor>- and suffered a severe setback the week of June 20. He was taken to the hospital and passed au-ay on June 
27. This was a tremendotis shock to me having seen him just a short time before. Gil and J had been fncnds since wc were five years old, ha\'ing gone through grammar school and college together. I enjoyed many wonderful times with his family and, abo, in our participation of many alumni activities «hich RAY COLLLVS uill also recall. Gil ifas in the insurance business and ser\-ed in many local alumni acti\'itics including one term as president of the X'otre Dame Ciub of Chicago. He is sur\*ived by his widow, Rita, Michael '59, and three daugh­ters. In a pre\'ious news column I had mentioned that his son, Michael, is married to the daughter of JOSEPH LAUERMAX whom many of you remember. 
Word has also been received of the death of CHARLES J, SPINNELLI, Munhall, Pa., in December of last year. HAROLD L. BENNETT died July 31 at Cu>-ahoga Falls, Ohio. On these I have no details. 
Our sjinpatliy is extended to the families of our deceased classmates. Please remember them In your prayers. S>-mpathy is also extended to BERT METZGER whose wife died June 19lh of this year. 
At the Universal Notre Dame Night of the X'otre Dame Club of Los Angeles I had a chance to visit uith TO.M ASHE, ED SHEERAX and ^UURICE REGAX and his wife. Some time ago I had a chance to phone a long lost classmate who left the campus after his sophomore year. Tom Ashe told me that FRANK LEDDY was living In Newport Beach where he had met him at Mass last year. I was there a short time ago and enjoyed a long talk with him and hope one of these da>-s We can get together. He sends his best to all his freshman and sophomore friends. I have not heard from BILL BERNING lately who keeps us posted on Texas and TEX BRIEGER. 
Our energetic classmate, JIM McQUAID, and his wonderful uife, Marie, liave been busj- on a pub­lication, A Guidebook to Historic Vinecnnes which they have co-authored.

I should like to hear from SPIKE SULLIVAN, TOAf MONAHAN, JOHN BURNS and many others on their attendance at both home and away football games this fall. It will be a bit difficult for me to get to the Morris Inn after a game where I alu-a>-s managed to garner bits of news for this column. To all of you my very best wishes. With the Grace of God, I plan on seeing many of >-ou next June at o-r THIRTY-FIFTH REUNION. PLAN ON BEING THERE!

All have heard from our new president announcing that Wc were in the black for our 30lh Reunion. No-shows likely helped the finances. Let's all plan now* to be at our naxt reunion and the devil with the red ink. 
The financial report on our 30th Reunion showed our gross income and carry-over to be $4,226. The ex­penses were 53,667 leaving a balance of $559. 
Heard from "DUKE" WALTERS. He's a VP with Boothc Leasing in Chicago at 135 S. LaSalle. Look forward to seeing him soon.

Again, please drop in when you're here and drop me a line when you get a chance. Sure would like to hear from you. 
The deadline for this issue is rather early so we cannot give a meaningful report on the Youngennan Fund. It is, however, ofT to a fine start and w'e know the Class of '35 will come through as alu-a\s in this tribute to Dan and the other deceased members of our class.

he is siill a bachelor. At French Lick—those GOP Councilmen certainly live It up, ch?—Bob met BILL LYNCH '37 of Chicago. Bob and Alice have eight children with seven attending six different scliools and one at home. Son Robert, a fine H.S. bsskei­baller, is a junior at XD.

GERRY SCHAEFER finally broke the sound bar­rier with his first letter to us after having received the ALUMXUS for the first time since leaving school. Gcrrv- bbtnes no one except himself. Gcrr>', a major with a San Francisco APO (33 AB Sg. Box 1651), saj-s he's alwa>-s moved before the .ALUMXUS could catch up with him. "Unfonunalcly, I've wandered this broad planet from Guam to Tok>'o, Pakistan, the Congo, Morocco and European spots all the way back to Saigon with intcniiittent stops throughout the USA too rapidly to ever become really associated with any particular group. But my heart and loyalty and tliat of my progeny is with Our Lady's Home of Learning!" Gerr>' and wife, Jean, have six prog­eny, "of which two (only) will be aspirants for a degree beneath the Dome—one probably in the class of '87." Gerr%- asked about PHIL HOEXE of Dululh, 
TED TREFZER, Iiis old roomie. DR. 0'LE.ARV, DICK FOLEY, GEORGE MORRIS and others of the Detroit clan. Gerrj* dosed by asking, "Please pass my respect and undjing devotion to our mentors and espcdally Fr. J. J. Cavanaugh." Tlianks Gerry for a wonderful letter, and to your wife for urging you to write.

T^c shadoiv of sorrou* has been cast once again upon the Class of '44. It is with profound regret that we report the sudden death on August 28 of THOM.AS F. H.^LLIGAN, Flint, Michigan. His untimely passing will be a shock to his host of friends and fellow classmates for Tom was a true son of Our Lady, an ever loyal and a most ardent supporter of ND in its many programs and chal­lenges. Tlie void will be, indeed, very great. To his wife, Margaret, and to his family go out the most fer\'ent prayers and heartfelt sympathy. 
Our svmpathy also is extended to BILL JOHN­STON, New Orieans, and to TOM ROLFS, West Bend, Wisconsin, upon the recent deaths of Bill's mother and Tom's father. Remember their souls together with the ever growing list of our Notre Dame family.

tended a cocktail party and dinner earlier that 
evening. I had completely forgotten the West

The Reunion got off on the right foot! Friday was 
golf day. No great scores were recorded but a lot of 
fun. The kegs were tapped about noon and for 
the rest of the day and night the glasses were 
never empty. 
Cocktails and class dinner were held in the North Dining Hall with REV. CH.ARLES CAREY, CSC and Alumni Board Member GEORGE B.AR­ISCILLO as our guests. JIM RETTER presided at a brief meeting.

It's been a long hot summer for everyone and as 
ive get ready to UTitc another column we find \vc 
don't have too much material. Haven't heard a 
word from anyone in the past five months so it 
makes it a little more than difiicult to find some­
thing to put in this edition. 
I had occasion to \*isit the campus for a flay 
in July while returning from a trip to Chicago, 
While there our Managing Editor JOHN 
LAUGHLIN took me through the plant where they 
print this magazine and several hundred other 
pieces of material and from what I saw it looks 
like he has a bigger problem getting columns 
printed than I have getting them together. A real 
beehive of activity out there at the Ave Maria 
Press and you can imagine what comes out of 
there over and above the usual Alumni and Founda­
tion materials which alone arc enough to keep 
a good size plant running. The place looks great 
and a great cliange has taken place since our last 
reunion with plenty more coming. 
While there I "sited with PROF. WES BENDER at the what used to be the College of Commerce. Wes Is about the only thing that hasn't changed out there. He looks like he did in '42 when many of us met him for the first time. While discussing the times of the post and present he told me that our good friend BILL BONWICH is leaving Notre Dame to assiune a new position at Indiana Uni­versity where he will head up the Marketing De­partment. We all wish Bill the best of luck and notv we have to Rod someoac to run the local arrangements for our reunion. Bill always did an outstanding job and we hope he will be around to sec us. 
Word has reached me that BRIAN StcCARTHY and his wife Freda have a new arri\-al which I believe makes 7 boys and one girl. Brian is a %fan­ufacturers Rep specializing In Electronic Equip­ment and lives In South Bend. 
^Vhlle in Chicago I saw DAN GENTILE who is now living In the Indianapolis area where RCA has their main offices for television products. At a recent golf outing of the New Jersey Club a number of the Class of '48 were on hand among them being GENE DEAN. BUNKY REGAN, "GENIAL GENE" ANGUILLI, JIM LEDWITH, JACK COONEY, RUS F.ARRELL, plus a few others whose names slip my mind at this time and ME. For the want of someone to fill a Club Trustee slot, I am now a trustee and a Class secretary at no increase in pay. 
Among the information received from the Alumni Office is word to the effect that DR. GERARD B. SCHROERING, JR. of Louisville, Ky. passed atvay ott April 20th and Paul Spahn, son of AL J. 
ALUMNUS, NOVEMBER I9i55 DECEMBER 
OASSES 
SPAHN of Elkart died on July 6th at the age 
of 16 years in a tractor accident. Masses were 
c^ered on the campus for these members of the; 
ND family and we are sure you will also be gen­
erous in youT pra>*ers for them. 
I am ashamed that this is a short column but 
there Is nothing I can do about it. Tliis column is 
supposed to have news of people in the Class of 
*48. If there is no news or info a\-ailablc this is 
the way it w^U hav*e to be. A lot of the names in 
recent columns have been repetitious only because 
these are the people I hear about or see. If j-ou 
want a change in the names, send in something 
about yourself or somebody else. That's the way we 
have to play the game for now and regrettably so 
but there is not much else we can do. You don't 
have to write a column—^just send a note. 
From the Alumni Oflice: LT. COL. JOSEPH D. SPIXELLI MA received the Army Commendation Medal Oct. 7 for znerito­rioits service as commanding officer, 4th Battalion, 20th Infantry, Fort Clayton, Canal Zone.

A recent feature article in the Ft. \Va>-ne-South Bend edition of Our Sunday Visitor brought to our attention the important contribution the LAW­RENCE METCALF family of Elkhart, Ind. is mak­ing in the field of Catholic education. Larry, with the assistance of his wife, started and now manages the National Catholic Placement Service for lay teachers. Both Metcalfs feel that their service satufics a grouing need in Catholic education.

From President Dick Pilger: The informal reunion on Oct. 2 was a success according to most (If not all) of the 150 people present. After all, the team won the game and the provisions held out (barely). I'm afraid the Class of '5^ Is beginning to show its age since it was actually possible to hold a conversation In 221B Engineering without shouting. Many thanks are due to GENE HENRY and Alice who took over the preparations while Fat and I were making arrangements for the adoption of our son, Richard Christian Pilger IV who finally arrived on October 5. (Wheel) Wc ^v-jll convene again next year after the first home game which will be Purdue on Sept. 24. 1966. Better order tickets early! Hi there! For a change, I can't complain about not having any material. Since the last column, we've had our liy2 year reunion party and then there was the ND-Army game In the Big City. While I didn't make the NY scene I did have a spy gathering up little bits of information, like guess who showed up at the Waldorf Pep Rally on crutches, A victim of that tough contact sport—badminton—JOE GALLAGHER that's who. Joe and his wife Eleanor live in Larchmont. Any^vay, first things first. Our annual reunion party took place right after the Northwestern Game. Our next party will be after the 1st home game in 1966. Purdue. It's hard to imagine this party could have been better than others past but I think it was. There were lots of new faces and many of the old regulars. RICH HOHMAN re­turned for his first party since leaving the Marine Corps. Ricli is the Chicago .Area Supcrvbor for ^IcDonald's Hamburgers and was really happy to be back. He reports that LARRY CORBETT, still in the USMC, is leaving wife Peggy and their six children behind at Camp Pendleton as he heads off for a tour at Okinawa. Tltc MORLEYS are moving from Indianapolis to Toledo where BILL is the new Automotive Division manager for Owens Coming. JOE McGINN was there and the big news is that Joe is engaged to be married. Better late than never, Joe. The three dropouts were reunited again. They are of counc, TOM BARRY, CLEM MAWICKE and 
CLASSES 

FR. JOE NASH. FR. DAVE BURRELL was also there. WALT "THE KING OF LOIHSVILLE" WAGNER was among the group as usual. I don[t think he's ever missed one. The Wagners had their third, Mary Michele, on July 27, 1965. They now have a boy and two girls. 
JOHN "BEERTOWN" SCHLOEGEL says he's on the dragon except when the Irish lose. The way the booze disappeared that afternoon I don't believe It. John reports that his ole buddy, ANDY CORRAO, moved to Rhode Isbnd in July. Andy is the eastern sales manager for Ampcrex. 
Norma and JOE GILSINGER also had a good time. Joe is the division plant personnel supr. for Wisconsin Telephone Co., Appleion, Wis. Joe and Norma are godparents for Stisan Depies. Susan is the ninth (yes, the ninth) child of Joyce and JOE DEPIES. They live in New Holstein. GENE HOWLEY runs a real swell bar right smack in the Center of Green Field. He mixes a mean martini. On the side he's district sales manager for DIebold, Inc. and the HOWLEYS live at 630 Carlisle Ave., Deerfield, III. 
Back after a long absence was J.^KE NOONAN. Jake is still riding herd in Sioux City, and he looked like he Just stepped out of Esquir* after a month In Miami. (But he's graying a Uttlc.) He, I'm happy to report, left his scissors home this trip. Ruth and GEORGE PFLAUM were also back after a few years. George Is still In the publishing business in Dayton, Ohio. The Pflaums have 4 children. 
A pause—and hats off to Prof. GE.VE HENRY who was the man behind the party. Again I must say that It's Gene and DICK PILGER who do put out the effort and buy the booze and head­cheese, etc. Thanks! Thanks! Thanks! 
A highlight of the party was the return of JACK 
PITTAS and Elaine. Gene Henry, Jack and I arc 
alumni of the some lugh school as well as ND so we 
had a double reunion. Jack looked prosperous 
(that's polite for fat). 
JERRY FINNEY wasn't there but I promised to 
mention his name every now and then. 
JUSTIN L. MORAN and Carol made their first 
reunion party. Justin wants his friends to know 
he's back in the Midwest from a long stay in 
Oregon. His new address Is 329 Mciriweathcr 
Road, Grosse Pointe Farm, Mich. He would like 
to hear from JOE D'ANTONI and J. L. 
WEIGAND. The Morans have three children, 
Elizabeth, Louis and Susan. JOHN DARAGO is 
asst. VP of Evans Savings Assn., Akron, O. and 
has four boys, the oldest of whom is big like 
daddy and tearing them up on the gridiron. 
GEORGE KOCK, Vickers, Inc., Bensenville, III. 
does quite a bit of traveling and calls me usually 
right after I move. Try again George, EX 8-4443, 
E. St. Louis. I have a crumpled business card here. It says THOMAS J. MURPHY. House of Representatives, Indianapolis, Ind. Tom is still single. The card is crumpled. I think, 'cause Tom said he was a Democrat. JOHN BIERBUSSE would like to hear from PHIL HIGGINS. John Is working on his master's degree In finance at W. Mich. He's been with American Seating Co., Grand Rapids, Mich, for the past five years. EDWARD MRAZ is a partner in a new law firm, Redmond, Morgan, Mraz and Bcnnorth, 104 E. Irving Park Road, Roselle. III. He has four children, two boys and two girls, DICK EHR returned from two weeks of Naval Air Reser^'e at Gitmo Cuba just in time for the game and party. He had ED MILOT.\ with him. It was Ed's first trip back. Ed Is co-pilot for 
American Air Lines (jets) and flies between Chi­cago and New York. 
Congratulations to our president, DICK PILGER. The Pilgers have adopted their first child, a boy. Richard, Jr. Some other important announcements: Pamela Erin Raith, daughter of Pat and FR.\NK RATTH was bom August 22, 1965. The longest (3 pages) birth announcement ever written has to be that of Emallc and ROGER FERN (3113 S. Eugene St., Baton Rouge, La. 70806). You may have known Roger Fern as Rog Femandes before he changed his name. "The little aggressor" was named Stephen Anthony Fem and he arrived on Aug. 24, 1965. And, of course. I take much pride In announcing the early fall arrival of Martin Edward Hubbard, seventh child of Mary Ann and GEORGE HUBB.\RD. 
Back to the party—JIM BERNHART was there as usual and we've dedded to let Ara stay around at least tUl the end of the season. PAUL KRAUS (Toledo) was at the game but couldn't make the party.

1955 
PAUL FULLMER 7344 N. Ridge Blvd., Chicago, III. 60645 
1963 w*ill long be known as the year of the GRE.AT REUNIONS! Many of us followed up the June Shindig uith muclio fun at the class cocktail part)' after the Southern Cal game. One thing is for sure—we have a great buncli of guys in this class. 
Might as well start out with a letter from FR. JOE O'DONNELL which I received upon register­ing at the reunion. I didn't liave enough space to include it In the last column but thought I would print it now since it was addressed to the Class of *55: 
"Some guys always seem to be going the ^vrong way on a one way street. T^velve years ago, when I entered the no\itiate (boot camp) oE the Holy Cross Fathers, I received a long, encouraging telegram from all the class who were in the NROTC. Now, here I am in the Na\Y when all the class is rctumlns for a reunion (reser\*e 
chaplain). I shall miss seeing the extended belts 
and jolly faces, and am a little worried about 
recognizing some of the troops In five more years! 
But I promise to be with you in spirit on this 
weekend. My Mass on Saturday will be offered 
for you and your intentions. On Friday I will 
be offering Mass for BILL BYRNE, at the request 
of his parents tvho ask to be remembered to all 
of you." 
Incidentally, Father Joe conducted tlie Big Re­treat on campus for some 1,300 men the weekend of Aug. 19-22. As you all know, he is the poor man's Bishop Sheen. 
I also received a letter on campus reunion weekend from DAVE METZ who docs a little 
p.r. work for Kodak. They need it. You should see the lousy pictures they send me—all out of focus, greenish, etc And they have the ner\'c to say it might be my fault! Here's one of Dave's gems: 
"Our two bo>*s are now five and three .. . and I'm pleased to report that they can, in dionis, get by with an acceptable version of the Victory March. Tlic>- have yet to master the pronunciation of 'Parseghian' .. . but what the hell, I can't even spell it!" 
Some of you might liave ^vondcred why wc made a big issue out of the number of children on the reunion registration form. Well, rumor had it that MARTY CULHAXE'S tribe had been outnumbered, twins or no twins. No one on the campus topped Martj', but I sent a note to MIKE W.-\RD (New York version) and got tills reply; 
*'Wc don't have ID or 11 kids, but wc do have eight out on the runway and a ninth in the hangar. So I guess you will have to tell MARTY CULH.\NE that he is "Number 2" and like Avis he will just have to tr>- harder. (Wish I had tliought of that line!) I'm an assistant vice-president and a senior security analyst In the rcscarcli de­partment here at Walston Sc Co." 
Mike had to take a certified financial analyst exam on reunion weekend, but he saw many ot the gang at the .^nny game. 
GEORGE SHELTON threw "Reunion II " for MIKE JACKMA N when he came through Chicago several weeks after the June festivities. Mike looks great and is teaching math and coaching basket­ball at Montclair High School In Pomona, Calif. His address is 906 Murray. Mike, Jean, and their ilds (two giris and a boy) were driving back. 
Otlicrs who tapped the keg at George*s clam­bake included DICK GAUTHIER, JACK GITS, JACK FLYNN, DICK BURKE, CHUCK DO­HERTY, JIM GRIFFIN and JOHN H.AMILTON. John, a lieutenant commander In the Na\-y, is doing some graduate work at Har\-ard. 
I tliink I forgot to mention that BILL TUNELL, now chief resident In surgcr>- at Bellcvue Hospital In NA'C (watch out Ben Casey), was at the re­union and told me that ART CONRAD, who went to Marquette mcd. school, now has seven children. Art and Dorothy live in LaCrosse, Ws. 
Father JOHN RYAN was subdeacon for Bishop McNamara of Joliet when he celebrated a solemn pontifical requiem Mass for Cardinal Meyer. 
While on the subject of our priestly classmates, I received a long letter from Father MIKE DUCEY (St.^ Mar\-'s College, Kurscong, DarjecHng Dt., India.) Here's a section: 
"Thanks ver>- mucli for handling tlic picture for the Alumnus. I just received my "advance" copy of the Fcb.-March issue, ^vhlch arrived licre today (June 24). I have a sneaking suspicion that you guys don't realize just how far away this place really Is. I hope the class had a good reunion. I'm expecting my invitation any week now. 
(Mike,^ don't be so impatient.) If you have ever been in a seminary- located (JO miles from the Tibet border, wherein the major occupation is studying theolog>-, you'll appreciate my difHculty in gathering any news for you. My ordination took place on March 19 down in Patna. ify mother came out for the occasion, and took many pictures. There's a nice one of mother and me sitting on Aurungzcb*s throne, with the Taj In the distant background. During the ordination trip, I saw Delhi, Benares and Agra for the first time. JERRY PRASS.^ mentioned to mc once that India is on his list of prospective tours. Come in the winter time, Jer, and you won't be sorrj-. TlicoIog>- ends for me in February. Alter that, the Lord only knows what is next. I'll try to keep you all posted," 
Thanks to BILL CANNING who sent a batch of clippings on my bride's trials and tribulations at the state golf tournament in Alton. Sandra lost the 36-liole diampionshlp match on the last hole! Bill lives at 1408 Crossbrook, Webster Groves, &fo., riglit outside of St. Louis. 
On the way back to Chicago after the reunion, LARRY BUCKLEY gave me a few fast notes (among other things): JACK TOKAR, who has done "some time" at Villanova Is now at NYU (126 Hicks Lane, Great Neck). CHARLIE BROWN is a New York patent attorney. 
Our condolences to JIM GRIFFIN, who lost his mother on Sept. 9. Mis. Griffin hosted many from the class during our four years at South Bend. Father JOE O'DONNELL represented the Class of '55 In a very special sense on the altar during the requiem Mass. A special memorial Mass also has been offered on campus. 
Let's take a quick look at the international scene. JIM McGUlRE has returned from Nicaragua and now lives at 636 Waveland Ave., Chicago. WALT KE.ARNS, a junior foreign officer ^vith the State Department, tackled a rough assignment In Thailand this year. Another foreign service officer, JIM CONLEY, moved from the embassy at Bel­grade, Yugoslavia, to the friendlier confines ot Brussels, Belgium. JOHN MUSOLINO took the long plunge from Dayton to G. E. W. Tel. & Electric, 21 Rueda Rhone, Gcne\-a, Switzerland. ED BORUS is back home (1345 Henrietta, Bir­mingham, Mich.) after his stint at Ford's office in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. 
]^liglit as well review the military' scene while we're at it. JIM EHRET (LCDR USN) is enjoy­ing the sun at the Naval Air Station at Lcmoore, Calif. Dr. TED LAUGHLIN was doing ph>-sicals at Eglin AFB in Florida at last report and getting his mail at 630 Lakcshore Dr., Maltland, Fla. JOHN DAMM (another LCDR) is a sailor stationed at Fallon, Ne^'ada? Write and explain that one, John. Globe-trotting JERRY HUGHES now Is with the 3617th Pit. Tng. Sqdn., Craig AFB, Ala. Lt. Cmdr. PAUL KRIENKE can be reached at Navy Air Force, VP 4 c/o FPO, San Francisco, CaliL Capt. WALT LANGFORD is with the 7405 Support Squadron, APO New York, 09332. 
That long-legged bird continues to make deliver­ies. NE.\L HALLORAN finally added a cheer­leader to his football team. Her name Is Pat. On the other hand, BOB WING welcomed his first boy (and don't call him "Little Moose") to go along with two little girls. JERRY BRANSFIELD enlarged his nursery to accommodate a second girl, his third cliild. Another lovely announcement from AL COWLES who greeted Shannon Elizabeth on June 21. 
You can really tell we're getting old when they refer to FRANK VARRICHIONE as that **nigged old pro trying to last out one more year in the limelight." It was too bad that DICK SZYMANSKI's serious injury* had to force him out of the Baltimore Colt lineup. I believe that ED COOK is still throwing a few blocks for the Cardinals. 
Before I forget it, I want to axpress the s>-mpathy of the class to BERT METZGER, who also lost his mother this summer. A spcual mem­orial Mass for Mrs. Metzger was said on campus. 
There's been quite a bit of movement In and out of California. First, WALT HOURT moved from Santa Ana to 8203 Dorset Dr., Springfield, Va. BOB RUSSELL left San Jose for 1175 Bishop Rd., Crosse Pointe Park, Mich. BILL McCUL-LOUGH traveled from Mt. View to another pleasant spot, Lovcland, Colo. (1704 Alcyta Ct.). 
Inbound were JLM TWOHY (1138-B Howe Ave., Sacramento), HARRY NEWMAN (37660 Timber St., Newark), JOHN HOEHN (349 Shire Oaks Ct., Lafayette), and CHUCK BEN-NETT (8361 Reilly Dr., Huntington Beach). 
Tliree guys followed the sun to Florida: MARK HEALY (1955 Esplandc E., Ft. Pierce), BILL MAY (7525 South West, 54th Court, Miami), and CHUCK HANLEY (2330 Pineapple Place, Merritt Island). How do you like that Pineapple Place!? 
I ran into FRANK CLELAND at O'Hare Air­port several months ago. He's now a flight engineer for United. Frank, who has been married a little over a year, has been taking special jet training. 
Pennsylv*anla also Is in the news. FRED KRACKLAUER moved on from Ohio to Pitts­burgh (132 Abbe>-\illc Rd.). GEORGE MARR left Beaumont for 208 Bennett St., Fox Hill Pkice, Exeter, Pa. 
LeaWng Governor Scranton's paradise were PASQUALE DI PASQUALE, uhose beard was the hit of the reunion and who now gets his mail at 1636 Fairmont Blvd., Eugene, Ore. (I expect him to star In a stainless steel commercial one of these days); FRANK ORLANDO, who moved to Barberton, Ohio (277 5th St. N. W.),* and JERRY KLENNER, who now lives at 100 E. Weaver Ave., Harrisonburg, Va.

JOHN P. McMEEL 30 E. 42nd St., New York, N.Y. 10017 
Spent a riotous weekend in Portland, Ore. with TOM HALEY, TOM HUGHES & Co. Both are causing much concern to their dedicated and devoted (they would have to be) wives, Lourdene and Nancy, respectively. Haley is swiftly becoming the hospital magnate of the Northwest while Hughes is in the process of changing the name of Portland Cement to Hughes Cement. The Halc>-s arc two and two while the Hughcses are raising a real fullback. Father Hughes is also quite instrumental in establishing a semi-pro foot­ball club. Also had the good fortune to see BOB BERSCHI.XSKI and his wife. Dot. Bob is teaching at Portland U. and swiftly becoming one of the young intellectuals in the Portland area. Fortu­nately, it still hasn't gone to his head. 
Sad, tragic news . . . JOHN HAMMETT by this time has walked the long walk down that long churcli aisle. On Oct. 30, John married Miss Pat Coleman of Long Island.

From the Alumni Office: Dillon Hall after the Oct. 23 ND-Southem Cal. game was the scene of the *57 fall football re­union.

From the Alumni Office: 
In October CHUCK QUEENAN sent a letter to this office oudining a program to start a per­manent scholarship fund at ND in memor>- of DICK HORSFAL. (As some of you may recall, Dick was lulled in Japan on Nov. 2, 1962 while attempting a *'whcel-less" landing oi his marine Jet.) A few montlis after Dick's death Chuck, along with sc\'­cral NO classmates and nonalumni friends from the Greenwich, Conn, area, decided to create a memorial and felt that any such gesture should be left in the hands of the Uni^xTsity. 
An inquiry to the University revealed that $IO,0(X) was needed to create a fund of this nature. Already, Chuck and se\'cral classmates have con­tacted a portion of the class, but arc, herewith maldng a class-wide appeal for support of this f 10.000 goal. 
In his recent letter. Chuck explains: *'We have done reasonably well in raising funds from his local friends, but as of j-ct, have not even publicized the existence of the fund to the entire class. . . . Our goal of a $10,000 scholarship fund may be a bit ambitious. Because of thb, if we haven't reached or even approached our goal by June, 1966, I will ask the University to permit us to use the money to buy a memorial in Dick*s name to be placed somewhere on campus. The Universit>' has in­dicated that this is entirely possible. Thus, I am no longer as concerned vdth the size of the fund as I am with the class participation in it." 
Checks should be made paj-ablc to: The Uni­vctMty of Notre Dame, Richard S. Horsfal Fund, Director of Scholarships, Notre Dame, Ind. Any further questions regarding the fund may be di­rected to Chuck Qucenan, 1017 Colfax St., Evans­ton, lU. 60201.

lOOTBAll: 
In the Wake 
The proverbial "Monday morning" has arrived on the football scene at Notre Dame. You can see it, you can feel it. 
The canvas that encloses Cartier Field has been stripped from the hurriccme fences and tucked away for its long winter's nap. Bob Cahill, ND's congenial athletic ticket man­ager, now leaves his ofiBce at five o'clock for the first time since mid­summer. And the student body has settled down to prepsure for the on­slaught of finals and term papers. 
But even more noticeable is the assemblage of statistics and facts 
i 
SSf^-BjSaSSi'gcg 

that are found in the wake of this year's football season. Some of these include: 
. . . the AP and XJPI unsmimous selection of Dick Arrington and Nick Rassas to their first-string 1965 Ail-American teams. Choices for honor­able mention between both wire services included Bill Wolski, Nick Eddy, Jim Lynch, Larry Conjar, Pete Duranko, Tom Carey and Tom Longo. 
a new five-game home football attendance record of 296,221 was estabhshed, thus surpassing the 293­
449 total set for 1956. 
. . . scoring honors for the Irish 
this year went to Wolski who had 
52 points, Ivan with 48 points and 
Conjar who scored 42 points. 
. . . among the 15 school football records broken were two by place­kicking specialist Ken Ivan who broke Gus Dorais' ('10-'13) string of 8 field goals in his career at ND with his 12 three-pointers. Likewise, Ivan snatched the record for most field goals in one season away from Joe Perkowski's ('61) five with the seven he kicked. 
. . . post-season games will find many ballplayers from Notre Dame on the VEuious squads. Coach Ara Parseghian wiU take along with him on his North squad Dan McGinn, Rassas, Carey, Longo, Bob Meeker and Arrington when he tangles with the South on Christmas Day. Playing in the East-West Shrine Game will be Captain Phil Sheridan, Wolski and Ivan. 
. . . after the first week in Decem­ber three ND players had signed professional contracts. Wolski and Sheridcm came to terms with Atlanta while Arunas Vasys signed with the Philadelphia Eagles. Others drafted but not signed as of December 1 included Rassas (Atlanta and Sam Diego), and Nick Eddy (Etetroit). Eddy has one more yejir of varsity eligibility. 
On and on the facts and figures win pour, some still undiscovered. They'll be retold and relived from now through the dead of winter, right up until spring football hits the air. 
And yet, it's a known fact, that for many inimitable Irish followers, one of whom we suspect may be Ara Parseghian, spring football talk started one night not too long ago in Miami. 
CROSS-COUNTRY: 
"Better than..." 
A rather bewildered Alex Wilson 
stood behind the desk of his Breen-
Phillips office fidgeting various let­
ters and assorted papers. 
"I wish I could give you better 
news . . . just don't know what 
happened." 
It was the day after the NCAA 
Cross Country Championship and 
the man fishing papers across the 
desk was Notre Vame's track coach, 
just returned from Lawrence, Kan., 
where his team finished ninth in a 
fidd of 20 varsity teams. 
"How do you figure it? . . . after 
outdistancing both the number one 
and two teams in regular season 
meets, you find yourself far behind 
in the finals." 
Wilson's obvious reference was 
the early-season Notre Dame Invita­
tional which saw the Irish sweep 
the four-mile honors from 11 other 
schools. Among them were Western 
Michigcm and Northwestern, first 
and second in the Kansas National 
finals. 

The fact is that ND's thinclads won all three of their dual meets, took first-place team honors in two invitational meets, zmd finished sec­ond in the highly regarded IC4A five-miler. 
Among Wilson's top individual performers this season was Captain Mike Coffey who set a new record on the Burke Memorial four-mile treck of 18:56.2. Others on the team included Ed Dean, Bill Leahy, Ken Howard, Larry Dimberger, Chuck Vehom and John Wholey. 
"Yes, I still think this year's squad is as good as, if not better than, our '57 NCAA championship team. We'll just have to try that much harder and prove it during the indoor season." 
And so went Alex Wilson about his paper-littered desk the day after the Lawrence, Kan., finals. 
FENCING: 
Character Building? 
The preseason optimism of the '65-'66 fencing team could easDy have a sad reckoning at year's end. The loss of two-time All-American Bill Ference and six other monogram winners, not to mention the addition of a powerful NYU dub to an al­ready stiff schedule, could lead many a coach to bemoan the prospects of 
DEAN, VEHORN, COFFEY, DIRNBERGER, LEAHY, HOWARD and WHOLEY a new year. Looking to the indoor season. "Not so," says Coach Mike De-

DeCICCO On fhe long end. 

Cicco. "Character building will not be our lone accomplishment. We'U be on the long end of another fine season." 
Maintaining the team's reputation of being the "winningest sport" at Notre Dame will take all the plus performances DeCicco can cuU from the eight returning lettermen and the bumper crop from last year's freshman group. 
The team looks strongest in sabre which has four monogramers re­turning in Co-captain Joe Malone, a senior from Brooklyn; John Klier, a senior from Syracuse, N.Y.; Gary Armstrong, a senior from Columbus, Ohio; and Pat Korth, a junior from Bloomfield Hills, Mich. The epee di­vision has returning monogram win­ners Co-captain John Haynes, a junior from Sjracuse, N.Y.; Frank Hajnik, a senior from Springdale, Pa.; Bill Ott, a senior from St. Louis, Mo.; and sophomore Steve Donlon of Farmingdale, N.Y., whose brother. 
John, captained the '61 team. 
Strength in the foil division is in the persons of senior monogram v/inner John Bishko of Clifton, N.J., junior monogram man John Carroll, of Grosse Pointe, Mich., and out­standing sophomore prospect John Crikelair of Ridgewood, N.J. 
The ten-meet schedule is as follows: 
Dec. 11 Indiana Tech at Fort Woyne Jan. 3 U. of III. IChicogo) and

SWIMMING: 
Rebound? 
The concern this year of Swim­ming Coach Dennis Stark and his team is to rebound from their first losing season in ND history. The prognosticator may find it hard, however, to side with the ND tank­ers who have only four returning lettermen. 
Coach Stark, far from pessimistic, yet not shotving the same confidence he did last season at this time, sees particular strength in the breast-strokers and distance freestylers. These hopes are well founded in the past performances of Captain Jack Stoltz of West Bend, Wis., and holder of the varsity record in the 500-yard freestyle, Humphrey Bo­han, freestyler from Summit, Pa., and breaststrokers Bob Husson of 
srons 

York, Pa., and Bill Ramis from 
Puerto Rico. In addition, Mike 
Schuck of Birmingham, Mich., a 
diver who won his monogram two 
years ago, is expected to return to 
action this season. 
Last year the Irish recorded a 5-6 

season that was beset with many in­
juries. Their schedule for '65-'66 is:

WRESTLING: 
More than a Memory? 
Confronted with a predominantly sophomore group and only a mem­ory of last year's AU-AmeriCcm Dick Arrington, Wrestling Coach Tom Fallon embarks this winter on a long hard schedule that features 11 dual meets and four invitational tour­naments. 
FaUon's problems are more than inexperience. Due to recurring in­juries, the status of the only return­ing monogram winners — Clete Willems of Kenosha, Wis.; Jim Bowers of Indianapolis, Ihd.; and Mike Eiben of Lebanon, Pa. — is doubtful. 
Other upperclassmen who are sure starters and who must play key roles this season are Ken Manning, Welles­ley Hills, Mass.; Neil PietrEmgdi, Kenosha, Wis.; Bill Kallal, Green­ville, ni.; Marshcdl Anders, Lafay­ette Hill, Pa.; Bill Schickel, Diyden, N.Y.; and Tom Lehmann, Louisville, Ky. 
In the forefront of the sophomore effort are lightweights Gary' Ticus, Chicago; Jan Whitacre, Muscatine, Iowa; Tim Morrissey, Edina, Minn.; middleweights Tim Mork, Anoka, Minn., and Art Tutela, Short Hills, N.J.; and heavyweight Mike Rush, Frankfort, Ky.

CAPTAIN McGANN: plagued with bad knee. 
BASKETBALL: 
Fast, Young Blood 
A narrow 75-69 victory over Lewis College in the opener followed by a sound 97-79 beating at the hands of Wisconsin may well signal what lies ahead of Johnny Dee the remainder of the season as he begins his second year as head coach of the Fighting Irish basketball team. 
Following true to preseason fore­casts, ND's first two performances revealed a startling lack of experi­ence and height, a situation that be­fell the Irish when they lost five of last year's top six men through graduation. From here they must face the remainder of their rugged 26-game schedule relying on the quick development of a sophomore-junior team that does possess, at least, good speed and a great deed of aggressiveness. 
Captain Bucky McGann, 6-3 for­ward, is the only retummg regular but the extent of his service to the ball dub remains a big question as he has been plagued with knee trou­ble. Other monogram winners, all of whom were reserves last yesu:, in­clude 6-4 senior center Tom Bom­horst, 6-3 junior forward Jim Mona­han, and 6-2 junior guard Bob Bentley. 
Also fighting for starting positions are a trio of sophomores: George Restovich, 6-3 forward; Brian Kel­ler, 6-4 forward; and Tony Vignali, a 6-6 center and the tallest man on the veu-sity roster. 
Monahan has been ND's early season point producer, netting 15 against Lewis aind 23 in the Wiscon­sin game. Second place scoring hon­ors have varied among Restovich, McGann and Bomhorst. 
Prior to the debut of this year's Irish team. Dee was somewhat opti­mistic that his "young blood" might better last year's 15-12 record. He quickly added, however, "great things can't really be expected this year. Possibly, we won't even make the national rankings. But it will be a team that is fast and well-condi­tioned." 
The long-range outlook is encour­aging if Dee's recruiting efforts are any indication. Johnny's first fresh­mzm roundup includes some rather tall and highly regarded talent who already have put the varsity through some grueUng paces. They are: for­

Even more impressive are Dee's far-reaching and unique plans to un­cover the hard-court talent that often has been overlooked at ND. Hiis year he has initiated a Fresh­man Tryout League. The league wDl have an 18- to. 20-gemie schedule, with each team playing Dee's schol­arship freshmen b^ore every home basketball game. After the regular league schedule, the 100 players will 
vote a 10-man all-star team that will

meet the scholarship freshmen be­fore the flnal home game. Hopefully, all of this will give the more talented freshmen a better chance for a var­sity place. 
The Irish wUI also have the ser­vices of a new assistant coach. He is Larry Staverman, a graduate of Villa Madonna College in Covington, Ky. He has spent his last six years in professional basketball playing with Cincinnati, Baltimore and De­troit in the NBA and Kansas City and Chicago in the ABL. 
Last year one of Dee's many inno­vations was a basketball homecom­ing for all former ND basketball players. Now considered an annual tradition, homecoming will be held this year on February 15 at the St. John's game. And, once again, one of the University's former basket­ball monogram winners will be hon­ored for his outstanding achieve­ment since his days at Notre Dame. Last year's winner was Ray Meyer, now head coach at DePaul. 
The schedule this year appears somewhat tougher than in previous years. Five Big Ten teams, several sectional powerhouses, plus many traditional rivals, give the Irish the opportunity to play what Dee con­siders, "the most outstanding collegi­ate basketball schedule in the coun­try today." Coach Dee's contention is, "we are making every effort to im­prove the caliber of our schedule so that when we move to the new Ath­letic and Convocation Center in De­cember, 1968, every home game will be an outstanding attraction." 
And around Notre Dame today most feel there is good reason to be­lieve that Johnny will accomplish just that.

The Coach's Outlook 

I've looked forward to this '65-'66 
basketball season with a great deal of 
enthusiasm. First, it represents the 
greatest challenge to me, personally, 
of any season I've ever coached bas­
ketball. Secondly, it's a real challenge 
to the players themselves. 

When you lose six seniors off of a 
squad that won 15 ball games last 
year, are playing one of the toughest 
schedules in the nation, and have only 
one regular returning, there's usually 
no way anyone can say the future 
looks bright. However, there are 
two really bright spots in our program this year. The first is that 
we are working with 19 players, including our freshmen, and 12 
of these young men will be with us two years from now. Add to 
this the incoming freshman groups in the fall of 1966 and the fall 
of 1967, and one has to be encouraged. 
Uncertain Odds. Through the excellent leadership of Captain 
Bucky McGann, the mental attitude and dedication of the present 
squad is excellent. They sincerely believe that they will not only 
equal, but surpass last year's won-loss record. Whether they can 
or not remains to be seen, but it's a genuine thrill for me as a 
coach to be working with a group of boys with this attitude and 
dedication to Notre Dame and to basketball. 
I don't know where we will end up in the national ranking, 
if in fact we will be ranked at all. But I can promise that they 
will be the number-one team in the nation for physical condition, 
hustle and determination. When you have these things, everything 
else seems to fit in place, regardless of your won-loss record. 
Unfounded Talent. A freshman tryout league has been assembled with eight teams playing a 20-game schedule. A league all-star team wiU play a preliminary game with our freshman scholarship players before all varsity home games. This development will stimulate student body interest, especially among the freshmen, as well as provide a new source of nonscholctrship players. We will have the entire winter to observe the play and development of these freshmen and possibly select some who could bolster the varsity forces in the future. 
Unending Plans. I hope that we will have the opportunity to meet many of you during the upcoming season. We are making efforts in most cities to coordinate the team's visit with some special activity by the local Clubs. We are happy to do this, as I believe our basketball team should be a public-relations instrument of the University, since it is possible for us to visit many different parts of the country whereas the football team cannot. And we are making a great deal of progress toward getting our teams into even more areas in the future. 
It won't be released for publication until sometime in late spring, but we have accepted an invitation to play in the lUunbow Qassic in Honolulu during the Christmas vacation in December, 1966, and we will play UCLA on the way to Hawaii on December 23, 1966. 
We are working with the State Department on a proposed six-week, 24-game tour of Europe with visits to Iceland, &eland, France, Italy, Spain, West Germany, Austria and, hopefully, one or two games behind the Iron Curtain. 
All of these plans, I believe, will develop to be extremdy bene­ficial to the basketball program and to Notre Dame.

WHETHER out on the basketball court readying players for pictures or in the stadium press box accommodating news reporters, Charlie Callahan in his inimitable way has brought na­tional attention to focuss on all athletics at Notre Dame. Charlie, with his wife alongside him during half­time ceremonies at the Michigan State game, was presented a plaque by the University for his 20 years of loyal service to Notre Dame. 
Back in '46 they figured it would be a "natural," a guy named Cal­lahan as sports publicity director of Notre Dame's Fighting Irish. In the 20 years that have since passed, the same lot that gave him the post readily learned just how much of a "natural" he was. 
Perhaps that's why it was so un­natiu^ last October to hear that 
Charles Martin CallJihan was leaving Notre Dame. 
It came as a jolt that Friday evening preceding the Southern California game. Most of those who had heard it by word of mouth didn't believe it. But just as sure as the Irish stomped Southern Cal the following day, the announcement of Callahan's resignation was made, far too loud and much too clear for his many friends across the country. 
At this time the Miami Dol­phins of the American Foot­ball League are announcing my acceptance of the position of publicity director of their team. I now announce my res­ignation as sports publicity director at the University of Notre Dame. I toiU begin with the Dolphins Jan. 15. Many thanks, for many favors, over many years. 
Charles M. CcHUihan 

CALLAHAN: 
There were tributes from around 
the country the day he resigned. But 
they did little to soften the departure 
of the man who had become a living 
legend. 
To many, the congenial host of the 
press box and year 'round voice of 
ND athletics means Notre Dame. 
In him they see a contribution to the 
University that is immeasurable, a 
love for Notre Dame that is classical. 
And always has it been that way 
since he first came to Notre Dame 
as a student in 1934. 
Then he began his writing cEireer worlcing for the sports staffs of the Sclwlastic and the Dome. Fol­lowing graduation in 1938 when he received an AB degree in journalism, Charlie took a job for one year at a dEun construction camp outside of Phoenix, Ariz., primarily with the hope of clearing his sinus troubles. 
From there he went to work in New York taking on such varied assignments as director of sports publicity at the 1939 New York World's Fair, reporter on World's Fair Daily, director of publicity for New York football Yankees, direc­tor of publicity for Boys' Club of New York. 
In August, 1942, Charlie joined the Army Air Corps where he held a berth as a sports promoter. Follow­ing his 40-month tour in service, Callah2m returned to Notre Dame where, on February 15,1946, he was appointed director of sports pub­licity. 
Since that time Charlie has been telling sports writers about such great ND athletes as Johnny Lujack, Ralph Guglielmi, Johnny Lattner, Dick Rosenthal, Paul Homung, Leon Hart, Tommy Hawkins, Johnny Huarte and many others. With 
Charlie has never been any­
thing but fair. He pays as 
much tinw to the man from 
the little Cedar Rapids paper 
as he does the writer on the 
large Chicago paper. He 
knows every sportswriter in 
the nation and treats every­
one vnth aU the interest he 
has.

... Callahan is one of the two greatest sports publicity men in the world. Tlie other^ just for the record^ is Fred Stabley of Michigan State. . . . CvH­lalian had to say it a second time and then a third time. If lie'd said tliat Fatlier Theo­dore Hesburgh, the president, or Fatlier Edmund Joyce, a vice president, was leaving, well, thafs the way the can­onical ball bounces. But Notre Dame without Callahan? Thafs like painting tlie Golden Dome orange. 
Bill Gleason CHICAGO'S AMERICAN 
ChEirlie it has been more than just a job or a hobby. It's been a sacred mission. 

Next to the man, perhaps best known of the Callahan tradition is the crammed-full, picture-laden office in which the Irish publicist works. From floor to ceiling, from wall to wall, are stacked papers, pro­grams, papers, newspapers, papers, letters and more anonymous papers. On the walls are hung dusty framed photographs of coaches and players who in themselves might constitute a hall of fame. 
It's from this office that Charlie floods newspaper desks with rosters. 
. . . to us students wlu> have worked for him, the news that came last Friday evening was a shock . . . he liad a special bond until every student who came into contact with him. Red Smith might be on the plwne, but Charlie Callahan never stopped thinking about tlie boys in his office. No one really loorked for Charlie Cal­lalian. Instead, lie made you feel that you were toorking with him to keep news chan­nels aware of the Notre Dame sports scene.

statistics and miscellaneous data so frequently that any sports bureau might conclude that only one college football team has ever existed or is of any real importance. 
Foremost of these is the weekly release during football season that previews the forthcoming weekend game and recaps the one past for more than 1500 radio and television stations and newspaper offices. 
Other publications eminating from the well-known Breen-Phillips office are the Football Dopebook, the foot­ball programs and the annual Mono­gram. News, an informal newssheet concerning athletics at the Univer­sity that is sent to over 2000 mono­gram winners. 
Besides his publicity work for Notre Dame, Charlie writes a weekly sports column for Our Sunday Visi­tor and, in late August, gamers all his know-how jind energy to to promote the annual AII-American Bowl Game in Buffalo. 
Farewells to Charlie began No­vember 20 at the ND-Michigan State game when Edward "Moose" Krause, University Athletic director, pre­sented a plaque to Charlie for his many years of loyal service to the University. Following the presenta­tion, the University's marching band played the "Victory March," report­edly, the first time anyone other than a Notre Dame athlete has been so honored. 
MR. SPORTS PUBIICITY Next stop: Miami 
. . . CharJAe is already a liv­ing legend. No man luia ever lived or died for any school the way Calldhan has done for Notre Dame. Through the years CdUdhan has put forth tlie greatest human effort pos­sible in his job. The'result is that lie is regarded as a mem­ber of the inner circle on the level with the coach and ath­letic director. . . . We vHsh him well in his new assign­ment, iut Notre Dame wiU never be the same vnthout him, and no man mU ever be able to fill his shoes. 
Roger Stanton

THE FOOTBALL NEWS 

The ND-Michigan State game also, was a grand finale for Charlie in a working sense. It was more than just his last home game. Attending what was then termed "the game of the year" was a record-breaking group of sports-writers that represoited well over 100 newspapers, thus sur­pzissing the press coverage of the famed Army gcune that ended in a 27-7 Irish victory. 
January 15 seemed a long way off back tiiere in October on the Fri­day evening before the Southern Cal game. But very quickly it hsis come upon Notre Dame, which now is about to lose one of its favorite sons and devoted servants .. . a living legend turned pro. 
Callahan himself is a part of tlie Notre Dame tradition by now. Pat O'Brien tootdd have trouble portraying him, per­haps, for there is nothing flamboyant about CdOdhan except his Irishness, but wher­ever there were two or more alumni gathered this week, or two or more subway alumni, one was telling the other that Notre Dame toill not be the 
same.
