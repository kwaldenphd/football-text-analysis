DEFENSE TRAINING 
With an actual attendance, at the sec­ond class meeting, of 1,407, Notre Dame's defense training program shifted into high gear to speed eflSciency in the battle of production. The program, which opened Feb. 9, was the fourth in the series of 12-week courses which the Universitj', in cooperation with the Unit­ed States Office of Education, is offering to give special civilian training in fields essential to national defense. 
Thii-ty-nine tuition-free classes are being offered, with each class taught twice weekly for two hours each night. Civilian re-sponse has been so enthusias­tic that government maximum enroll­ment figures have had to be ""lifted in or­der to accomodate the interested citizens of St. Joseph County and neighboring communities. The special faculty is composed largely of Notre Dame teach­ers. 
The largest enrollment is in the i-adio division with 263 registered. The class­es in industrial safety are second in size, having 100; while the class in tools and dies lists 88 students. Other courses be­ing offered are: engineering physics, ma­chine drawing, elementary and advanced drawing, metallurgy, tools, dies, jigs and fixtures, engineering mechanics, strength of materials, materials testing, concrete design and practice, methods engineer­ing, work simplification, electric motors and control, applied electronics, airplane stress analysis, industrial management, foremanship, personnel administration, salary occupation evaluation, cost ac­counting, statistics, defense contracts and problems, advanced organic chemis­try, and general chemistrj\ 
The classes are open to high school graduates or persons with equivalent in­dustrial experience. The courses are open to both men and women without regard to race or creed. 
Notre Dame Defense Coordinator, Rev. James D. Trahey, C. S. C, is act­ing as supervisor for the elaborate ci­vilian defense training program, in ad­dition to his duties of manning an office to aid boys in the draft and a clearing house for recruiting on the campus by the various military services. 
ON NUTRITION FOUNDATION 

The appointment of Eev. Hugh O'Don­nell, C.S.C., president of the University, as a director of the newly-formed Nutri­tion Foundation by Dr. Karl Compton, president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is one more Notre Dame step in another major war effort, that of nutrition. 
Father O'Donnell attended the organ­ization dinner of the foundation, March 12, in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, New York City. The foundation was formed by 15 of the nation's leading food and allied industries, and further support will be solicited by the directors from other related industries which may be­come sustaining members. Representa­tives of the public will also be appointed to the foundation. 
The foundation plans to develop and apply the science of nutrition "by lawful and effective means as a public institu­tion operating on a non-profit basis. The field is expected to cover such wartime problems as substitute foods used to meet basic food shortages, and compact food rations for armed forces. Notre Dame's biological department and laboratories may contribute substantially to the prog­ress of the science during the crisis. 
MANION IS HONORED 
Clarence E. Manion, dean of the Notre Dame Law School, received an honorary 

LL.D. deg:ree during the celebration of annual Foimder's Day at Boston Uni­versity, on March 12 and 13, in "recog­nition of the outstanding service" he is rendering "in the field of religrion and the law." He addressed the Founder's Day convocation on the subject, "Relig­ion and American Law," an observance which also marked the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Boston University Law School. 
Dean Manion was a principal speaker on a nation-wide NBC broadcast on March 2, from New York City, inaugur­ating a campaign for Americanism edu­cation to be sponsored by the Knights of Columbus. Presiding was Timothy P. Galvin, '16, of Hammond, Ind., supreme master of the Fourth Degree Knights. Others who participated in the progr^n were Archbishop Francis J. Spellman, LL.D., '35, and J. Edgar Hoover, chief of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
Dean Manion addressed the Fourth Degree Knights of Columbus in Birming­ham, Ala., on Feb. 22, Washington's Birthday. His address was broadcast by the Columbia chain.

Father Murray was the fifth Holy Cross priest to become an Army chaplain in recent months. Fathers Robert W. Woodward, '28; George J. Welch, '29; Joseph D. Barry, '29, and Edward R. Fitzgerald, '30, preceded him into the military service. 
AERONAUTICAL MEETING HERE 
Notre Dame was host to 200 students and numerous visiting technicians and engineering professors, members of the Institute of Aeronautical Sciences from 12 college and imiversity branches throughout the Middle-West, at a convo­cation March 20 and 21. An open house held the second day of the meeting, opened to the public for inspection the engineering facilities at Notre Dame. 
The speaker's program included Major 

L. D. Gardner, executive vice-president of the Institute of Aeronautical Sciences, New York City, and William B. Stout, widely known head of the Stout Engi­neering Laboratories, Detroit.

ant of the Ninth Naval District, and Rev. Hugh O'Donnell, C.S.C, president of the University. 
Begun in 1924, Universal Notre Dame Night has an­nually grown in program and extent. The 94 local alumni clubs throughout the world, supplemented by other groups, especially this year the N.D. men in the many camps and training schools of the armed forces, meet simultaneously on this night, and since 1935 have enjoyed the unifying factor of a national radio broad­

cast. 

The Nineteenth annual Universal Notre Dame Night will be held on Fri­day, April 17, and will feature the moving of the Blue Network "Meet Your Navy" radio program to the Notre Dame campus for that night. 
The above announcement, made by Harry F. Kelly, secretary of state of Michigan, and national president of the Alumni Association, ties in closely with the arrival on the University campus of the 1,000 V-T Navy apprentice seamen for indoctrination training. The broad­cast, usually emanating from the Great Lakes Naval Training Station, will be held in the University Gymnasium with the V-7 men, 3,000 Notre Dame students, faculty and officer personnel and the Notre Dame alumni of the St. Joseph Valley in attendance, totaling an antici­pated 5,500. 
The broadcast, 7:30 to 8 P. M. central war time, will feature the Great Lakes band and choir, with orchestra, the Uni­versity band and glee club, and talks by Rear Admiral John Downes, command­
The close relationship existing between Notre Dame and the Navy makes this union of Notre Dame Night and the Navy broadcast one of both strength and mutual interest. 
All club presidents have received two bulletins from the Alumni Office, giving numerous details of, and suggestions for, the Night. At least one other bulletin will probably be sent to the same gentlemen. Alumni in club areas are, therefore, asked to keep closely in touch with their clubs with regard to individual observ­ances of the occasion. Almnni in non-dnb areas are asked to communicate with their nearest Blue Network stations to insure reception of the campus radio program on the maximum iramber of stations.

The Centenary 
nition of Timothy P. Galvin, '16, of Ham­
Exigencies of War Period Dictate Modified Plans 
Elaborate plans for a Centenary which would feature recognition of all phases of the University's 100 years, in the 15 months from June, 1942 to September, 1943, have been modified by the admin­istration to conform to the demands of the war effort and the all-out attention to the immediate problems involved. 
However, motivated by the thought that the recognition and continuation of sound education are among these im­mediate problems, Notre Dame will offi­cially observe the Centenary during the scholastic year 1942-43, with a program reduced to a non-festive and distinctly constructive nature. 
Details of the new program have not yet been revealed in full by the admin­istration. 
Events scheduled to take place at the University under the auspices of outside organizations will go ahead as scheduled within the new limitations imposed by the presence of the continuous naval program involving 1,000 V-? trainees housed on the campus. 
The University's own initiated pro­gram will consist of only a few events on the campus, but the objective is to make these outstanding in every way, and contributions to the progress of edu­cation as applied to the problems of the country. 
The historj' of the Universitj' ^vill be published, probably during the Centen­ary year. It is hoped that the Notre Dame prayer-book will be completed. And through radio and publications, the University hopes to reach those alumni and friends who may not be able to come to the campus for the restricted pro­grams which will take place here. 
Alumni have an excellent opportunity to contribute to the success of the Cen­tenary. 
Our financial program, already launched and in the hands of the clubs, will be a basic form of this contribu­tion. 
But there are many other ways. Notre Dame's first 100 years stand out, par­ticularly in the light of limited material resources, as an era of great spiritual strength. As alumni of this period, you can contribute your spiritual aid to the launching of the second 100 years. And your example, evident throughout the world, will make an additional contribu­tion to the realization that Notre Dame has achieved its spiritual objective. 
You can, by your leadership, your 

work, and your example, bring to ever 
increasing circles evidence of the cul­
tural impact of Notre Dame. 
You can, by enterprise and coopera­

tion with the campus, maintain to the 
limit that various circumstances permit, 
the vital enrollment that best enables 
Notre Dame to fulfil its mission. 
You can refresh your contacts with 

Notre Dame by coming back to the cam­
pus yourself whenever opportunity i>er­
mits. Personal contact and knowledge 
is a stimulus in itself, and a source of 
missionary inspiration that nothing else 
creates. 
Notre Dame's Centenary, in spite of the willing limitations made to aid the mnning of the war, can be successful if you will support in every way the Uni­versity that made you Notre Dame men, and be the Notre Dame men the Uni­versity made you.

He came to this coun­try in 1900 through the help of Father Vattman, an American missionary sta­tioned in the Philippine Islands. On his arrival in the United States, he was en­tertained by "Teddy" Koosevelt, and breakfasted ^vith the president at the White House. Also numbered among his friends were such dignitaries as Pius X, Leo Xin, President Taft, President Wil­son, Cardinal Hayes, and Cardinal Mun­delein. 
He has studied many types of weaving and needlework. His technique of blend­ing Chinese silk with delicate shadings and his original designs won laudations and awards at the Chicago and the St. Louis fairs. Some of the vestments that are to .be used during the Notre Dame centenary services were made by him over a three and one-half year period. His other accomplishments include a teaching knowledge of French, Spanish, German and Latin; and painting with oils on velvet; he is an accomplished musician on the piano, guitar, organ and violin.

War Breaks Commencement Traditions 
Alumni Association and University WoHdng io Hold Interest and Spirit; No Campus Hous­ing Results In One-Day Alumni Prograrn for '42 
Hardly a square foot of world is un­affected by the war, and the campus is no exception. 
Latest war-problem for alumni is Commencement. The University admin­istration and the Alumni Association of­ficers have seen it coming for some months and have osed every means pos­sible to solve it to mutual satisfaction. 
But the results involve inevitably a sacrifice of the old physical comforts of the traditional Commencement week­ends. 
As it stands now^for the duration Commencement itself will be variable in emphasis because of the three semesters. 
Housing complications, caused by the addition of the V-7 trainees who will use continuously Howard, Morrissey and Lyons Halls; and the shifting of stu­dents to the other halls on a 2-for-l basis; plus the short lapse of time be­tween semesters which will produce no complete hall evacuation as in the old summer vacation period^have combined to permit no housing on the campus of returning aliunni. 
Inasmuch as the South Bend hotels will be taxed, as always, by the parents of the graduates, alumni are faced with the same situation as that of a football week-end. 
Logically, then, the Association has had to work on the same basis, and re­duce the alumni program for the '42 Commencement to one day, Saturday, May 9. Alomni-who-wish to come in earlier, or to stay over for Sunday's academic program, will have to contrib­ute their part to tiie war effort by mak­ing arrangements for hotel or private home accommodations. The Alumni Of­fice will aid in this when desired, as on football week-ends. 
Many alumni in the heavily populated "driving and commuting" areaChica­go, Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, Detroit, Grand Rapids, Toledo, Calumet District, etccan come in in the dew of the morning, and leave in the calm still of the ni^it, and hardly know that they haven't had the traditional Commence­ment. 
The program now planned api)ears elsewhere on this page. 
This program, crowded as it is with important and interesting events, seems to preserve the general outline of the traditional week-end of Commencement, and should repay generously all those who make the effort and the sacrifice in­volved in carrying it out. 
We hope to have registration id the Alumni 0£Sce as always, to designate the individuals and the classes by badge for the important and pleasant fratern­ity of reunion and new acquaintance. The reunion luncheons should bring to­gether old classmates and a wealth of memories. 
The alumni forums are too valuable in themselves, and too valuable as con­tributions to needed straight thiwMtig in this period of crisis, to be permitted to lapse. Alumni opinion, solicited in'a recent approach to many alamoi, will guide the selection of topics for these forums, which will be announced as soon as possible, but which will be surely of general interest and importance. 
B« 
The Alumni' Banquet will bring the entire attendance together as always, 'with an even more important and inter­esting program in 'View of the curcmn­stances of the year. Father O'Donnell's annual report 'will have a deeper signifi­cance than ever, and the affairs of the Association need your attention and sup­port more than in any previous period. 
Many alumni are tied down by busi­ness and many 'will have only a short leave from military service. It may well be that the curtailment of the pro­gram 'will be an asset rather than a lia­bility. 
At least it has the element.of novelfy asking for fewer hours of effort lath­er than more hours. The item of ex­pense is reduced to some extent by the one-day program, and the difference where it is of no vital dgnificance to the saver, can well be added to Hbe alum­ni contribution to the Association's Cen­tenary campaign. 
There are many favorable ancles to the new program. And we bdieve that with alumni cooperatiom we can preaerve an of the content of the worthwhile phases of Commencement in this altered form.

Helen C. White Receives Laetare Medal 
Helen Constance White, teacher and author, of the University of Wisconsin, was on March 15 announced as the 60th Laetare Medalist of Notre Dame, the thirteenth woman to receive the medal, which was first awarded to John Gilmary Shea, historian, in 1883. 
Selection of Miss White by Notre Dame singles out for reward and en­couragement a life devoted to the things of the mind and the spirit. 
.Rev. Hugh O'Donnell, C.S.C, presi­dent of the University, said in announc­ing the selection on this Laetare Simday: 
"To the gifted and scholarly Helen Constance White, a brilliant professor in English at the University of Wiscon­sin, and the author of several important literary works,, the University of Notre Dame is proud to award the Laetare Medal for 1942. Miss White's literary successes have been remarkable, but none more so than the devout Catholic life which she has achieved and which she admirably exemplifies through her talent­ed mind and heart." 
The medal was inaug^urated in 1883 by Notre Dame to give each year some rec­ognition to an outstanding member of the Catholic laity in the United States. It derives its inspiration from the Golden Rose, awarded each year on Laetare Sunday also, by the Pope to a layman. The list of recipients since 1883 traces the constructive course of Catholicity in this country. Many have been nationally known. Many others, and this was one of the purposes of the Medal, have done outstanding good for country and church, with little recognition. 
Miss White is a frequent visitor at St. Mary's CoUeg^e, Notre Dame, and a close personal friend of Sister °M. Madeleva, C.S.C, its president. Her books in the Notre Dame library are in constant de­mand by the students, a tribute to her literary excellence. 
The medalist was bom in New Haven, Conn., in 1896, and was educated at Rad­cliife College. After taking her M.A.. there and teaching at Smith Collie until 1919, she came to the University of Wis­consin, where she received her Ph.D.- in

She has held several outstanding fellowships at Wisconsin, including two Guggenheim, and a Henry Huntington Library award.

she was editor, with F. Foster, of Vie­
torian Prose. 
The 1942 medalist adds to a list of il­lustrions American women whose works reflect the contribntions to chanwtw and culture which have bron^t women so large a part in the Imilding of America. 
In a world at war, with the emphasia on urgent physical needs, Notre Darnels selection of Miss IVhite provides an im­portant pause for recognition and re­flection in the fields of the spiritual and the intellectoal, the real and nitiniate objectives of the fi^t of the democracies. 
The Laetare Medal is recognized as the highest award made annually in the United States to a member of the Cath­olic laity. The name of the redpieot is announced on Laetare Sunday, the fonrth Sunday of Lent, a day set aside by the Church for rejoicing in anticipation of Easter. 
It was first suggested in 1882 when 
Prof. James F. Edwards soliniitted fhe 
project to the V»y Rev. IMward F. 
Sorin, C.S.C, at that time president of ~the University. 
The attractive medal is composed of a . soUd gold disc hong tzom a' gdd bar bearin g the inscription "Laetare Medal." The sentence. Magna est Veritas et praevalebit (Truth is mij^ty and irill prevail), is inscribed aronnd the edge of the disc "Fhe design of the medal is changed each year depending on the profession of the recipient. 
The name of the outstanding Catholic layman or laywoman whose distinction in a particular field of endeavor has re­flected {^ory upon the Catholic faith is selected from a list submitted to the president of Notre Dame and a Laetare Medal eomnuttee.

NEW COURSE ON CHINA 
A former member of the Chinese army 

and air force and native of Canton, 
China, Jackson Benedict Chung, senior 
engineering student at Notre Dame, 
opened a comprehensive two hour a week 
course entitled "Modem China" at the 
University on March 16. Culture, history 
and modem conditions, together with a 
study of the Chinese language, will com­
prise the subject matter of the course, 
which is open to students of the Univer­
sity and townspeople of South Bend. 
Chung, who is 28, came to America shortly after resigning from the Chinese Army, in order to continue his studies. He has lost track of his family through the Pacific crisis, and since has become a salesman, conducted a curio shop, and has held various other jobs at Notre Dame. His adaptation to American ways was evidoit in his appearance on the nation-wide "Vox Pop" program from Notre Dame in December. 
 DESVERNINE SPEAKS 
The distmguished jurist, author and lecturer, Eaoul E. Desvemine, of New York City, spoke at Notre Dame, Feb. 17 on the subject "Religion and the Law." Mr. Desvemine was the second speaker in the series by eminent jurists at Notre Dame this year, the first hav­ing been Dean Roscoe Pound of Harvard University. Mr. Desvemine is at present representing the steel industry on the governing board of the National Indus­trial Conference Board, and is chairman of its committee on industrial mobiliza­tion problems, which consists of 200 lead­ing indosttialists in America. Author of Demoeratie Despotism and Claims Against Mexico, Mr. Desvemine has had wide background in practically all legal experience related to finance and govern­ment rdations. 
HcCready Huston, well known to many Notre Dame men through his as­sociation with the late South Bend Neios-Timea, is now editor of Frontiers, a magazine of natural history published by the Academy of Natural Sciences, 1900 Kaee St, Philadelphia. He is an assodate member of the Notre Dame Club of Phfladelphia.

at Notre Dame. This class pretended to ptepsre a young fellow as a reliable book-keeper and stenographer. He was 11 years old when he came to Notre Dame. He stayed five years. And dnring that time. Father Granger was his con­fessor and friend. 
It was the fashion of Notre Dame in those days to give prizes for nearly everythingneatness, politeness, regu­larity, as well as Latin, Greek, and alge­bra. Well, during his first year, Maurice got away with quite a few prizes. He was a bit of a piano player; he was rated high in politeness, penmanship, reading, spelling and elocution. If you want to check on me, you can read the catalogue for 1860-61. 
His second year was not so good. Maurice had slipped a bit. How that makes one think of you! Maurice was still tops in politeness, but he didn't run away with so many premiums.. He got a few, though. His public reading was the best in the "Junior" department, and he was in the fore, according to his teacher of geography. In the meantime, he kept close to Father Granger, and his soul was well taken care of, pure, clean, fervent. 
As to his third year, he was rated diligent, neat and polite. But aside from Christian Doctrine and i)ennianship, he was no great shakes as a scholar. At the Commenconait exercises of 1863, he gfot no prizes at aU. He somewhat re­deemed hinnsplf in 1864. He came close to winning the premium of Honor in the Junior department, and he ran away with the prizes for French and Si>anish. And he was rated the most polite fellow at Notre Dame. 
Well, to get back to the letter. Father Granger hdd it in his hands, and tears came to his brown eyes. When he raised his spectacles and dried his eyes, he read the letter again.

". . . In Dr. John R. Tobin you inai/ revive a less venal; a 'more neighborly past. As you read of his eager, industri-OMS, and successful life you tvill have a greater respect for that America which gave its precious freedom to his fore­bears, making their ivay from New Or­leans to Gilberts to found their small dynasty here in the Fox River Valley. Dr. John R. Tobin is yet a vital force in this community; his boys and his neph­ew are to follow in his footsteps. He has served his neighbors faithfully; he has guided his sojis toivard a useful life. The world, at least our part of it, is a richer place because this man and his Mth and kin have dtvelt and worked here 

Two Notre Dame doctors and one No­tre Dame doctor-about-to-be are doing fine jobs of living up to the remarkable reputation for service which their father, Dr. John R. Tobin, elected to the Alumni Association in 1929, has built up through years of devotion to his prac­tice among his neighbors in the Fox River Valley of IHinois. 
This is the story of a remarkable "No­tre Dame family." To Dr. Tobin and his wife, of Elgin, HI., four children were bom: Paul G., '28, James W., '29, Alice, and John R., Jr., '38. 
Paul, at Notre Dame, was in the Knights of Columbus, the Chicago Club and interhall athletics. He finished in medicine at Rush Medical College of the University of Chicago in 1932. Special­izing in orthopedic and bone woric, he received further training at the Presby­terian Hospital, Chicago; Los Angeles

John R. Tobin, M.D. 
County Hospital, Los Angeles; and was house physician at the Good Samaritan Hospital of the same dty until he re­turned in 1936 to join his father in the Elgin Clinic. 
Dr. Jim Tobin participated in Notre Dame varsity track, was president of Ihe Fox River Valley Club, and active in interhall athletics, the Knights of Co­lumbus, the Chemists Club, and the Chi­cago Club. He received his M. D. from Rush in 1933, and served his internship at St. Luke's Hospital, until joining his father at the Clinic in 1935. Training in medicine, Jim specialized in urology. He is president of the St. Joseph's Hos­pital medical staif, Elgin. On Feb. 5, 1941, he was married to Miss Margaret 
H. O'Brien. 
The youngest son, John R. Tobin, Jr., while at Notre Dame was a member of the Knights of Columbus, the Student Activities Council, the Wranglers and the Academy of Science. He is finishing his senior year at Rush Medical Col­lege. He was recently elected to Alpha Omeg^a Alpha, the national honorary fraternity comprised of medical students of exceptionally high scholastic stand­ings. 
Now Mrs. Franklin P. Branagan of Mt. Vernon, N. Y;, Alice, the daughter, who majored in voice at St. Mary's, No­tre Dame, has attained fame as a vocal­ist; she has sung in the Chicago Civic Opera and at many concerts in the East. 

A nephew. Dr. Walter W. Tobin, was graduated from the University of Illinois Medical School, interned at Bil­lings Memorial Hospital, Chicago, and is now a resident dermatologist at Bil­lings.

Tlie physician who has attended him almost throughout his sickness has pro­nounced his life as near its close; and ardently desiring to prepare himself with all fervor for the great change that awaits him., he vnslies, while his strength is sufficient, to return to the spot where his early piety was strengthened during some happy years of his boyhood, and there yield up his innocent life to the God who gave it At home, where every physical comfort, and mast tender do­mestic intercourse surrounds him, he cannot find that spiritual atmosphere so cliaracteristic of Notre Dame, and for which he longs in the path his feet must tread. 
His affectionate heart, it is true, clings to tliese dear members of his family cir­cle, but, as he said to me a few days ago with tears dropping from his eyes, "the parting will be bitter, for if I leave them I sluM go knowing I have looked my last; but, after all, it loill only be anliei­pating death which will, in a few weeks, tear me from them. And oh, I cannot die liere where, though I can get the sacra­ments, I shall not have the daily and Iwurly comfort of religion that I need. And perhaps God will accept the sacri­fice since I make it for my souL" 
Will you accede to his request, and receive him into the infirmary or else­where where the sisters and the priests may prepare him, for his last end? I will watch over him. at night, for while God leaves him to me, I will never leave him.... Hoping that your answer may be speedy and favorable, I remain

As we leaf throng^ the pages of the 

Scholastic for 1872, we come to the very . last issne, that of Dec. 28, and there we find the announcement of his death. Maurice Williams, a victim of tubercu­losis, died at Notre Dame on the 17th of December. A final paragraph is a fit ending to our story. 
".... A life always remarkable for its unwavering and lively faith in the Cath­olic truths which were his birthright and inheritance, was crowned by a death, peaceful and. holy, amidst Religious whose presence and surroundings for the last two months of his life, made his com­fort and support in the valley of the shadow of death. His last movements were to toipe the streaming tears from his mother's eyes, and to bid farewell to the priest, faithful and true, whose holy offices in his behalf ceased not in death." 
Father Granger went back to the pres­bytery. His heart was expanded in joy. A Notre Dame student had died well. In his mind, he was thinking of something he had often repeated to generations of Notre Dame lads: "The purpose of a Catholic education is to teach men, not only how to live good lives, but also to die good deaths!"

The purpose of the articles is to con­solidate under central control the many phases of the business of the University which have expanded to substantial pro­portions along with the growth of en­roUment in recent years. The survey npon which the articles are predicated revealed that Notre Dame is operating on an unprecedented scale in its volume of business. Its non-profit nature, its lack of' capital oidowment, itis continuing aid to students, and its continuing policy of low cost to studaits, makes the efiScient conduct of its business phases increas­ingly TitaL The new articles also remove many burdens of administration from the president, leaving him free to face tlie major academic and administrative problems which are bringing education toward a new order..

ATHLETICS 
TRACK 
We ended last month's report on a sad, plaintive note, you will recall. The track team had just lost to Michigan, the bas­ketball team had just dropped one to Michigan State, and the fencers had been nosed out by Chicago and Ohio State. 
But now it is spring. The air is full of rain, snow, and hope for the track, baseball, golf, and tennis teams, while memories of the winter sports program are pleasant, indeed. 
Coach Bill Mahoney of the track squad was a very dejected young man after the Michigan meet. He had figured the Irish to win, with a good deal of reason to back up his enthusiasm. They were nosed out by a red-hot team that was set for its evening's work. 

His only other crack at Michigan was to come in the Butler relays, and he began plotting his revenge immediately. Notre Dame repeated its Central Collegi­ate conference indoor conquest, making 48 points to Michigan State's 45, even though Capt. Ray Koy was unable to run in the 440, an event he had won two years straight, because of an infected, impacted wisdom tooth. Ollie Hunter, two-miler, Jim Delaney, shot putter, and the one-mile relay team, with Austin Jones substituting for Roy, all retained their titles. 
Take Butler Relays 

Mahoney made no eifort to key the squad for the Centrals, and the lads still squeezed through with a victory. He did key them for the Butler Relays the next week, however, and here's what happened: Notre Dame won with 331/3 points to Ohio State's 27, and Indiana's 
21. Michigan, which had won the title eight years in a row, finished Qut of the money. The Irish finished ahead of the Big Ten champions, and the Big Six titlist, Nebraska. With Roy back in form, the mile relay team won a thiQler from Ohio State in 3:21.4. The medley relay unit of Dick Tupta, Frank Conforti, Austin Jones, and Hunter finished a good second to Indiana's winners. The four-mile team of William Kelly, Hunter, Conforti, and Tony Maloney took third behind Illinois and Michigan. Circum­stances surrounding the four-mile event were unusual in that the third Illinois man was permitted to run an extra lap, and the anchor man one lap less than scheduled to run. Maloney was nipped at the tape for second place. 
Keith O'Rourke, junior high jumper, retained his Butler title at 6 feet 3% inches. Bill Dillon, junior hurdler, was shut out by a great field in the lows, but he captured third in the highs. Charles Murphy collected a third place tie in the high jump, and Charles Wiethoff cleared 13 feet, his best competitive effort, for a fourth place tie in the pole vault. 
Set New Record 

Fresh from this conquest, the mile team of Roy, Fehlig, Tupta, and Schiewe, rose to even greater heights in the Chi­cago Relays before some 15,000 fans, the largest indoor track crowd in his­tory. In their match race with Ohio State and Indiana they got a terrific battle from the Buckeyes, but a perfect pass from Tupta to Schiewe and the latter's estimated 48.5 anchor leg gave them a victory in 3:19.2, a new all-time Notre Dame indoor record and a new Chicago Relays mark. This also gave Notre Dame permanent possession of the Knox tro­phy, a handsome silver bowl, which goes to the team winning twice in three years, Notre Dame having won last year also. If no one wins twice in "three years, the team with the best time over that period takes the cup. So the Irish won on two counts. 
John Murphy, a freshman sprinter from St. Louis, found himself right at home in fast company. Running unat­tached, he won the qualifying heat for the sprint series. Unplaced in the 40­yard dash. Murphy took third in the 50­yard sprint, and second in the 5&-yard event. His total gave him third for the series behind the inimitable Herbert Thompson, and Lee Farmer, Iowa's Big Ten chcunpion. 
Another refreshing hapipening of the evening was Ollie Hunter's great bid for third place in the two-mile run, which was won, naturally, by Greg Sice^ '39, of the New York A.C., Gilbert Dodds was second, and Joe McCInskey nosed out Hunter for third. Ollie was docked unofficially in 9:13, however, which is some 10 seconds better than his best pre­vious performance, and is the outstand­ing collegiate time to date this year. 
Getting around to Greg Kice who al­thoo^ an alumnus, is still activeand we're entering that remark in the na­tional understatement derby  well let the facts speak for themselves. He opened his indoor campaign Feb. 7, and he ran 10 races. Eight of them were over the two-mile distance. The world record was 8:58 by Don Lash when Greg start­ed breaking it. He was over 8:58 only once in ei{^t starts this year, running 
8:59.5. His "second-worst" times was 

8:55.1in his third appearance in a space of eight days, as follows: March 20 Chicago Relays, 8:53; March 25Navy' relief meet in New York, 8:52.9; and March 27  Cleveland K. of C. meet, 
8:55.1.
 His best time of the season, 8:52, made without noticeable opposition or help, came March 14 in the New York 

K.
 of C. meet. Between two-mile events, we almost neglected to mention, Greg found time to break his own world three-mile and two-and-a-half mile marks with performances of 13:45.7 and 11:32.^ re-, spectively. Both times, and'the accumu­lation of times in the two-mile'run leave. us so breathless that we can't even dis­cuss them. 


Outdoor Track Prospects 

We have not bothered asking Coach Mahoney about his outdoor prospects. They are undoubtedly good, but proba­bly not as fine as he, in the enthusiasm of his 25 summers and admiration of his boys,-would rate them. We're just not risking putting him on record. The sched^ ul^ we can confide, however, is inter­esting. The Irish will defend their, un­official Drake Relays championship, will try to advance trtaa second place in the outdoor Centrals, and 'will take a crack at the national championships..They 'will try to retain their Indiana State title, either at Notre Dame or at Lafayette. And they will meet Michigan State at home in a dual meet, travding to Coltmt­bia and to West Point for duels with Missouri and Army, respectively. The card follows: 
April 24-25Dnke Bdairs at Des Hoinn Hmr 2lOnoari at Cohnnbia Hay 9MicUsan State at Notre Dame Mar 16Array at'West Point Kay 2SIndiana State Heet (Site undecided.) June 6C.CC. Heet at If ilwuikee Jane 20N.CJLA. Heet at Utteota, Xebr. .. . 
BASKETBALL 
The basketball season had practically mn its course when we left off a month ago, and we merely want to report that what looked like a dangerous slump ma­terialized into one at the end. Marquette, despite the presence of Coach George E. Keogan on the bench, won a 46 to 43 decision at Milwaukee, and it took a last-ditch rally to win the finale from Detroit at Detroit, 43 to 41. 
The Marquette win, in view of Notre Dame's 66 to 42 victory at home, came as considerably more of a surprise than Michigan State's 46 to 43 victory at East Lansing, following Notre Dame's 52 to 49 decision at home. These two defeats and the scare at Detroit constituted the slump mentioned above. 
The season's record of 16 victories in 22 starts is certainly not without merit, however. The Irish compiled one -winning streak of eight straight games, and took 12 out of 13 in a January-February run. The total of 1,045 points score was the fonrth highest ever made by a Notre Dame team, and the second highest total for 22 games or fewer, last year's team having made 1,062 in 22 contests. Oppon­ents made 906 itoints, the most ever scored against Notre Dame. This, we prefer to believe, is the fault of the race­horse game and not of a defense that was highly efficient, particularly against top-flight competition. The season's rec­ord left Keogan's percentage at .768 as compared -with .771 at the end of last season. He has won 315 games, lost 95, and tied one in 19 seasons. The Irish averaged 51.83 points at home and 42.3 away. They held opponents to 43.5 away and to 37.58 here. 
Butler's victory, 49 to 43, at Indian­apolis, was the first January defeat suf­fered by Notre Dame since Jan. 4, 1938, -when Minnesota won, 37 to 25, at Min­neapolis. The Irish have not lost a Jan-nary home game since Jan. 14, 1933, when Bntler turned the trick, 27 to 25. 
The record:

FENCING 
The two 'tough ones" Coach Walter 

M. Langford's fencers had. left as we went to press last time resulted in an even split, the Irish losing to Wisconsin at Madison, 16% to 10%, then -upsetting a surprisingly powerful Marquette unit, 16 to lljthe next day at Milwaukee. The season's record of 5 -victories in 8 starts is not the best Notre Dame has ever had, nor the best Langford has had at Notre Dame. In -view of losses by graduation, enlistment, and conscription, however, it is an excellent mark. The epee team was particularly outstanding in li^ t of a shortage of blades, which forced cancellation of practice in this weapon. The blades are made in Europe. 
The Irish managed to nose out Illinois' Big Ten champions, 14 to 13, just as a year ago they defeated Chicago's con­ferences winners, 17 to 10. Herb Helton in sabre, Capt. Frank Veit in epee, and Angel Gonzalez in foil were outstand­ing. Gonzalez' brother, Ventura, has just won the freshman foils tournament, her­alding the inauguration of another of Notre Dame's famous brother combina­tions. 
The junior combination of Mdton, John Flynn, and Jim Madigan turned in the best total -victory record of any junior class in Notre Dame fencing his­tory. Because of the closeness of most matches, however, there was little oppor­tunity to work sophomores into the pic­ture for seasoning. The record follows: 
. Notre Dame, 14; Michigan State, 13 Notre Dame, 16; Purdue, 11 Notre Dame, 11; Cincinnati, 6 Notre Dame, 14; Illinois, 13 Chicago, 15; Notre Dame. 12 Ohio State, 14%; Notre Dame, U H Wisconsin, 16^ : Notre Dame, 10 ^ Notre Dame, 16; Marquette, 11 
GOLF 

Big news of the 1942 golf season, of course, is Notre Dame's sponsorship of the N.C~A.A. tournament June 22 to 27 over the Chain O' Lakes course of the South Bend Country Club, proceeds to go to the Navy Relief Fund. The 45th annual intercoll^ate championship is the only amateur tournament of national scope being played this year. 
Somewhere in the field of 175 to 200 coU^ans may be another Lawson Little, Bobby Jones, H. Chandler Egan, Jess Sweetser, Johnny Fischer, Tom Sheehan, Charley Tates, Paul Leslie, Sam Parks, Maurice McCarthy, Bob Babbish, Jack Westland, Watts Gnnn, George Dunlap, Freddie Haas, Willie Tumesa, Charles Kocsis, Walter Emery, or Larry MoUer ^these being a. few of the ex-collegiate stars who have gone on to international fame on -the links. 
Father George L. Holderith, C.S.C, varsity golf coach, is doing a major share of the tremendous amount of work necessary to the successful staging of such a championship. 
Meanwhile, he is also watching the skies closely in order to sneak his 1942 candidates out onto the practice tee be^ tween rains and blizzards. The Irish do not shape op as championship material, but with the advantage of an intimate knowledge of the foibles of the local course, they should be hi{^ in the final standings. Father Holderith -will build his unit around five lettermen: Gene Fehlig, who is again deserting the track squad to take his place in the No. 1 or No. 2 spot; Capt. BUly Wilson, secre­tary-treasurer of the National Intercol­legiate Golf Association; Jack Conrj-, University champion; Bill Fisher, and John Harrington. While this quintet ap­pears to have the starting jobs cinched, Tom Nash, Jack Hedges, Paul Malloy, Mel Wilke, and Southpaw Bill Moorhead -will be in the race. 
The compete schedule follows: 
April 18^Purdue at Notre Dame 
April 25^minois at Champaign 

May 2Great Lakes at Notre Dame 
(Date tentative) 
May 4^Minnesota at Notre Dame 
May 11Wisconsin at Madison 
June 5Midiigan State at East Lansing 
Jane 6^Detroit at Detroit 

June 14^Northwestern at South Bend 
June 22-27N.CA-A. tournament at South Bend 
 BASEBALL 
Seven monogram -winners from 1941 form the nucleus of Coach Clarence (Jake) Kline's ninth squad. Five of them are battery men. Capt. Bemie Crimmins, all-Ameriean guard last Fal, and Hike Kelly have won sweaters behind the plate John Metzger, Subby Nowicki, and Bob (Bobo) Fischer, all right banders, are the monndsmen. Harold Smullen, and Norval Trimbom, a southpaw, are the most promising sophomore hnrlers. 
Andy Chlebeck, who captained last year's team and led the dub in batting with a .479 average, is the only letter­man outfielder available. He wiU be in center, probably flanked by Frank San­filippo, and John (Buster) Hiller, bas­ketball star, in left and right, respective­ly. Bill Stewart, Jr., son of the National league umpire; Dick Kisgen, and John Milliman are the other promising garden candidates. 
The infield has only one letterman available, George Sobek, who also starred in basketball. He is battling Jim Carlin for the second base post. Carlin, whose versatility will come in handy, is also under consideration for the third base assignment, with Sophomore Dick Grant his leading rival. The disposition of these assignments wQl be settled largely in hitting drills. Fred Gore, a smooth field­ing second sacker two years ago, is now at shortstop. Jack Tallett, 6-foot 3-inch junior, is at first base. 
The 1942 card, abbreviated because of the May 10 Commencement, follows: 
Apr, 7Purdue at Lafayette Apr. 11Ghicaso at Notre Dame Apr. IS & 16Iowa at Notre Dame .\pr. 21Northwestern at Notre Dame Apr. 22Purdue at Notre Dame -\pr. 27Northwestern at £^mnston Apr. 29Michigan at Ann Aibor May 2^Western Michigan at Kalamazoo May 4Michi^n at Notre Dame May 9Western Michigan at Notre Dame 
TENNIS 
Despite the loss of three of last year's first six men, Coach Walter M. Langford rates Notre Dame's 1942 tennis prospects the best in history, hastening to point out that the schedule is the most ambi­tious ever arranged for the Fighting Irish. 
"It's hard to tell who will be our No. 1 man, or how the first four will line up," says Langford. "We should be some­what stronger in the first four positions, but not as strong as last year in the No. 5 and 6 spots." 
Capt. Jack Joyce, No. 2; John Walsh, No. 5; and Norman Heckler, No. 6, have been graduated. Captain-Elect Dan Ca­nale, Memphis, Tenn., No. 1 last year; Olen Parks, Mishawaka, Ind., No. 3; and George Biittner, Schenectady, N. Y., No. 4, are back. 

Supplementing them are Bobby Faught, Cleveland Heists, Ohio, sopho­more basketball star; James (Bud) Ford, Alhambra, Calif.; and Lyle Joyce, Tucapau, S. C, brother of last year's captain, all newcomers; and Fred Dootd, Mishawaka, Ind.; and Nidc P^paa, South Bend, holdovers. Faught, formerly No. 10 in the nation in boys' tomis, was schoolboy champion of Ohio. 
By dropping Detroit and adding Illi­nois and Wisconsin, the Irish have stif­fened the schedule considerably. Lidnded are the top Big Ten teams^Northwest­em, Chicago, and Michiganas w<ll as the usually-potent Michigan State squad. 
The schedule follows: 
Apr. 17^Michigan State at East Lansine .4pr. 18Michigan at Ann Arbor  Apr. 21niinois (site undecided) Apr. 25Kentucky at Notre Dame Apr. 28^Western Michigan at Kalamazoo . Apr. 30Indiana at Notre Dame May 2Wisconsin at Madison May 7Chicago at Notre Dame May 9Northwestern at Notre Dame 
Hugh A. O'Donneli Gifts 
Testimonials to the active, interesting, and progressive life of one of Notre Dame's outstanding alumni, Hu ^ A. O'Donneli, '94, former president of the Alumni Association, became the property of the University Library in the form of' rare books, autographs and paintings, Paul E. Byrne, the librarian, an­nounced recently. The gifts provided for by the -will of the late Mr. O'Donneli in­clude autographs' of some of the world's best known characters, (among them President Roosevelt, the late Father Francis P. Duffy and Eamon de Valera), 17 autographed books, and an oil painting of the famed New York City alunmus by the artist Nikol Schattenstein which now has a featured position oh the east wall of the journalism room in the Li­brary. 
The career of one of Notre Dame's outstanding journalists, which began as a Scholastic editor in his undergraduate days, finally blossomed into a keynote position as assistant business manager for the New York Times. Mr. O'Donneli was a founder of the Notre Dame Club of New York and one of its most active members. He had innumerable friends among Notre Dame men and was for many years a "one-man onployment agency" for Notre Dame men in New York City. 
Notre Dame, in addition to a valuable collection of letters, books, and paintings, benefits according to Mr. O'Donndl's wiU by the "Hugh A. O'Donneli Award," which provides a gold medal each year to the outstanding senior journalist, a prize established as a tribute to a de­ceased brother,-James F. O'Donndl.

REDUCING AN ALUMNUS 
The news of clnbs and classes is much reduced in this issue. Rea­son: ITniversal Notre Dame Wght. 
The editors had the choice of sending notifications to dub secre­taries and class secretaries, wait­ing for their news and "coming out" just after the Night; or tak­ing the dub and the dass news on hand and going to press so as to be in the mail well before U. 
N. D. Night. For the sake of publidzing, in a critical and significant year, a top­notch TJ.N.D. Night program, the said editors chose the latter course. 
Hochreiter, De Coursey, Doan, Toomey et alplease don't shoot. 
P. S. The next issue of the ALUMNUS will be out after Com­mencement, which is set for May

Come out ye men who used to be Seias87 and lank and sallow-faced ' And let your old professors see ' Ihe suivlns that has cone to waTst 
Once you were agile, light and gay' Before you understood life's.woes. But now a load or two of hay Would scarcely fill your ample clothaa  
If married men ye chance to be ' Don't hesitate to leave your spouse. It's time to let the lady see That you're a man and not a mouse 
Come out and spend a happy day And warble the old melodies. The while you drive life's care away . And fill your soul with memories 
You'll hear again of Jack and Bill Who sleep somewhere in Franee tonight. Out there upon a lonely hill Beneath the pale moon's golden light 
You'll talk of Ftefs who naad to daal In matters that were largely bunk. Who gave yon for a mental meal Boloney in a massive hunk 
Perhaps you'll pleasantly recall The prefect that yon knew of yore Who nailed the windows of the Hall And slept all night beside the door 
You'll meet the room mate who was taH. Whose lodes were plentiful and fair. And you wiU find a biUiaid ball Where once had waved his bushy hair 
Come live the old days, one by one. With the best fnends yon ever knew. And thoroughly enioy tha ttat The while yoo have a drink er two 
Come out today and celebrate Your silver anniversary. Tomorrow, it will be too late 
When you are just a memory. T. E. B.

From L M Baddey: 

Due to an error in address which we can't blame on Bill Cranin's postoffice department. Bill Kp*s notes did not arrive in time to meet the deadline for the last issue. Bill is tax attorney for the Indiana Bell Telephone Go. in Indianapolis. He is manied and has three children. He reports as follows on the Indianapolis *2S men. 
"Jahn daaka has been disabled for the last few yein and is not worldng. He lives at home and is sin^e. Fnd Pfartncr is with the Indianapolis Foncr * Utjiit Co. Charier Bikjr is married, and works in the Indiana Employment Security Di­vision irith "Jia Bachninc. Tom Backelshans is one of the ownen of the Bed Cab Company. He is marned and a polo player in his spare time Bcnie LadDer of West Virsinia is here at the Tdq^one Coinpany. He is married and has a 
dani^tcr," 
At Bill's snsgcstimi. our old cheer leader. Bob ~ IBi^> came throogii with the following in the usual Kifby a^le: 
"Several jcars aso. Dr. Frank Hecarty was dsaitintad as die 'eolamnist' for the class of '28, so I took it upon mjself to write him an alleged latter,-hnping tliat l would break into print be­fore the time that I reach that page in the 
jUaanns'
 iriiidi lists those sons of N. D. that have stepped to the sieat beyond. The Doctor was 

videntlr
 loadsd wiQi material, becaoie I scanned the '28 news for mntiths thereafter to no avaiL Tlie only nason that 1 mention this is to advise yea that I haven't done m darned thing nnce then tliat is worth writing about. I had five kids then. and I still had five when I counted them at 7:30 tUa Bomine. St. Mary's 4Notre Dame 1. 


"As tile yeaxs roll by. it seems that I have less and leas itmiirm to bear from, or know about, any of A e T28 sang; ISiis is probably due to the fast tliat I have become holed in this Boosier SMlKiiiiilli in the capadtr oi one of the saddest iimelisaifn in the diocese. Vinee Oaeey is about the only nvolar that I've maintained contact with, and 1 haven't heard from him since last summer.

Jim Boehning. who heads the Interstate De­partment of the Indiana Employment Security Division, took time out from paying unemployBMnt compensation benefits to send Bill the foUowing:

I am glad to give you some news from the Southwest this month via Christie Flanacan from Fort Arthur, Tex. Christie wrote to a number of fellows for news. I hope those who failed to reply will do so at once so we can include their eoo­tribntlons in the next issue. Christie has two sirls and two boys. He didn't mention what he was doing but his letter-head was as follows: Christie ^. Flanagan t Co., Ship and Forwar^ng Asents. Customs House Brokers and Stevedores. Christie gives us the following dope on three fellowa whom we have not had a report on for some time: 
"In this locality I see ChanMe Harria who lives in Houston, and by the way Is with a new law firm. He is a married man with a fanuly and a prosperous future. Herb Sdialtz Is still in Port Arthur in the paint and paper business and widics to be remembered to all his friends; he is stffi single and about to get married to Unde Sam. Bari Boyldn is In Beaumont and in tlw brass fittings business and, bendes elipplns enqpons and staying in good mtfa the refineries, he finds time for his golf; he is married happily with a fmily." 

Fred Baiz wrote Christie from S08-l(t]i Ave.' So., Nampa, Ida., where he is teadiins in the local senior hitji school. Re d has five children. He mentioned that he sees Tem Janes in Bmse once in a blue moon. 
Art Canty came through with the foUowins in reply to Christie's request:

5-YEAR REUNION 

I Clauof 1937 | 
May 9. 1942 

I For details, see story elsewheie in | = this issue and letter to each mem-| I ber of reanion classes. 1 
From Paal Faiey: 

For the first time since we inherited this chore we are able to approach it with something like a blithe spiritsimply £pping down into the lower drawer for that pack of letters we salted away after the last screed. 
Incidentally, we're doing this stint on St. Pat­rick's daya fitting and pn^er time to dip into a long letter from Vlace Ibrpiv. now established in Evanston. HL Slays Viaee (not too belDgereat­ly): 
"Tm still a liberalyou can get soBie idea b^ remeaihf ring that BUI HcNaly used to call lie 'Bomb Thrower' Murphy." Knowing the HcNd y tiike. we diseoont the whole idea. 
Muiphy is now an interviewer with the United ' States Employment Service. By way of his own empkqment Vince is able to torn in an admirable report: He was married Nor. IT. 1937. now has two sons Tlxnaas Brian, three years old. TBCttce I ^ and when he wrote (Jan. 7) was expeetfag a third hdr. 
Vinee says he is active in the saiae K. ol C cooadl \riiidi daims Al Siaitk but the lattcr'is most inaietiTe. MnriA reports hearing oeeadonally from Paal Blagari and Jiia OUanMB. WeTve re­ported CO Pan] froas time to time and can now repMt that Jim. after a soceessfnl trip amoad. the coarse at Harvard, is itiot wdL 
jU Hater in January reported himwlf dafcnad froas atand activity and going great gnaa wMi a coal ODtfit in Chicago. Beiaaid Marty is. or ' was. still unmarried and travelBng a beat sdBag hospital supplies. 
ReportinGT on a trip to Springfield, III., Murphj­says: "While walkinjr through the local Cathedral I was tapped on the shoulder by Floyd Miller, who has the books of the AlHs-Chalraers Corp. thor­oughly balled up and has been doing same since graduation." 
John Blondctoh, who started his Bend career vnih the '37 cr«© but dropped out of school a year, is now situated in Decatur, III. 
Redmond Davgan is scurrying about a huge Social Security district near Alamosa, Colo., and when last reported was heading for New Orleans on a vacation^wonder if he ran into Joe Drolla? 
We are happy to report, through our Evanston bureau, Harpby. that Frank Foley is successfully married and was last heard from in South Bend where he and Mrs. rode herd on Frank, Jr.. a tow-head. 
Johnny Hart is also married and has been seen wheeling his baby daughter Maty Kathryn round the block. 
Ihe Marphy letter winds up with a couple of snapshots of the familyexcellent pictures and family too, we might add. One of the shots was made on the steps of the $80,000 J. F. Cuneo mausoleum in Calvary Cemetery^but the sun was shining and all seemed well with clan Murphy. 
From information taken straight from a'neat engraved announcement we are able to report the wedding of John Midiael Powers, Jr. to Miss inidred Hetz on Jan. 3 in Houston. Tex. 
Jim Downey, M.D., reports from City Hospital in St. Louis, Mo., where he is interning. He was able to report on his first son, bom Nov. 24. Jim . Sfud the Army had one eye on him as far back as JanuaTT. so by now he may be under even closer scrutiny. 
Agmn we get red-hot news from Decatur, Ala. from Bob Gro^an, a flying cadet in Squadron 2, Air Corps Training Detachment. Since the last ^vord came through early in January he may be many rods from Decatur by now. But Ruby Rob­ert sounded in .excellent spirits and reported an Army technique of discipline worthy of a men's college we know: It seems the Army will not allow its flying cadets to drink 24 hours 1>cfore flying: but they fly every day-
Since his name is Grogan, however, and since we know his family are right nice people, we will as soon as this screed is tapped out, think of him for the duration of a green beer in Tom Ixjng's hacienda this St. Patrick's day. 
We can report personally on the good work bdng accomplished in the Holland, Mich, sector by Bernard Dminelly who is at present travelling for Donnelly- Kelley Glass Company and hits De­troit occasionally. The Donnelly's possess a new daughter-T-or did we tell you before ? 
Much of the information emanating from the "Terror of the '40's," Mr. Leon Henderson of OFA, comes straight from Joe Ixiftns who is assifirned to that bureau as an assistant economist in charge of research statisticsthe'boys who will soon rule the world. Joe, not content with a spot in the greatest .Democratic administration since Wilson, is also pursuing a PhJ). in Sconoroics, and expects it from Johns Hopkins shortly. 
But perhaps by now Joe has exdianged all that for a private's countrj* khaki ensemble. 
Pete Johncn, impressario of the piano and other similar nt^se-makers, reports from Chicago where he is a book-keeper and estimator for a plastering oonoem. (No cracks) Acouiring a taste for the plasterincr trade. Fete also owns a tavern on the south side of Chicago (3149 W. 59th St. for you tmvelen). 
Pete has not deserted the song-writins frfttcrnity and has a new number called "I ICss Ton Kore Each Day"he thinks it might go places and Jus cooked up some air-time for it. Listen and request give a local boy a plug. 
From Cleveland,'where he is coaching football and basketball at S t Ignatius Hi ^ school, comes word from John Levidd. The Levidds are PTGA>­ably the proud parents of two children nowthe second was expected sometime in Febniary; the first boy is just past two years old. While John himself makes no comment, we understand his coaching job has been iirst^rate in every respect. 
On crisp 25 per cent rag content piu»er, the kind affected by insurance salesmen, we hear from Mark Lonerran who reveals that in Oct(A>er 1940, he ^vas married to Miss Mary T. McCarthy "a violent Irish-Catholic" The quotes belong to Lonergan, thank God. The Ix>nergan8 are llvincp in Montclair, N. J., the following paragraph will give you a rough idea of what goes on over in Mont­clair: 
"For the past three years I have had a partic­ularly exhilarating experience with a group here in the city working with the Russian Uniate Catholics. Most of the work consisted in learning Russian and dnging Mass in the Byzantine Rite. However, on Aug. 8, my wife presented me with a 6% pound son and I have found it necessary to . return to the Latin rite and sing lullabies in good old Anplo-Saxon. My plansto rear a futtirc Dominican!" 
We are happy to report a long and interesting letter from. John Lantar down in Monndsville. 
W. Va., with the Fostoria Glass Company. John is happily married and the father of two girls. Joanne and Tom Marie. 
John is also grand knight of Father Flanagan Council 1907 of the K. of C. and is, OT was, battling with the idea of a new clubhouse for the Knights of Moundsville. For a short time John taught emperical design and mechanical drawing at West Virginia University but work forced him to give up the extra routine. 
According to Lautar he has run into a good many of his ex-team-mates at various of the ball games. He reports seeing Vic Wojdhovski and his ri^t-hand man, Walt Scfarader,- and such stal­warts as Art Cronin, Blatt Themes. WaDy Fmn­hart and Larry Danbomon many of whom we have reported at greater length. 
Frank Ganl, we understand, is still assistinc Tom Conley at John Carroll. 
Up to his ears in the job of building ships for our seven ocean navy is Joe HanfellL Joe tells ft tj-pical New Jersey story of being unable to set a teaching appointment because the wronsr poli­tical party w*as in the saddle. So he turned to industry and is now a full fledged wdder ftt Federal Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, Kearney. N. J. 
Jack Hurley wings in a note from Rodiester. 
N. Y., where he is still covering all the riaks he can uncover for John Hancock Life Insonnce (^mpany. Jack says he has visited the campus frequently but is able to report seeing only one of the '37 varietyNed Joyce who still holds fpr^ in Carolina. 
Jack brings word of Bob Weaver who is re­ported practicing law in Coshocton. C . (says Hurley). 
Zeke CftcUey is in on a new racket-'or at least he was^that of driving 600 nilea ft day for GMAC to catch up with the boys who couldn't catch np ^t h their payments. We find this a n d commentaiT on the N.D. Journalism Departmeiit. 
Jee Wdck* says Hnrley, was on the campus last spring, sporting a new car and saying nice things aboot. the status quo in Weedsport. N. T. Joe is married and has one child. 
From Louisville, deep in the julep belt we hear fnnn XWrnns H. Ln^ey, Jr., and in a nnmd­abont way of Thomas H. Lackey. III.a very lacks gay. Thomas (Jr) is working for Jones Dabney Paint (Company, married a South Bend girt and is a faithful attendant at N.D. meetings in the Great Louisville front. 
Lmis HiAenhacfc is now treasurer of Gtencoe distilleries and the father of two children. 
So we saw off for another issuekeeping a neat reserve of half a dozen later letters, stacked like sandbags against the assault of another deadline. 
Before you see this print, or shortly thereafter, yon will receive a letter from the FUey lad giving in some detail the plans for the fifth reunion of the class on May 9. And there will donbtless be a general reunion story elsewhere in the April issue. 
No one is sorrier than I am that our plans for the five-year reunion have to be so shalren apart by the military necessities on the campos. But, even with a one-day program, let's get back there to see each other. A '37 session will provide a tonic all around. 
At solemn services in St. Joseph's Novitiate, Rolling Prairie, Ind., Basil Gillespie, C.S.C.. hav­ing completed a year's novitiate training, took t^nporary vows of poverty, chastity, and obedi­ence, in early February. 
J«e McNftlty is now a lieutenant, senior grade, in the U. S. Navy, and is stationed in the vicinity of Washington, where he is a torpedo inspector.

John BericUiiffk having successfully completed eigfat months of advanced flight training, was recently awarded his "wings" at the Marine Air Station, Miami, Fla., and commissioned a second lieutenant in the U. S. Marine Corps Reserve. 
llie following is a letter from Ned Hahwick. ex. '38, in part: "I'm still here in St. Augustine. Fla., working for the Florida East Coast Hotel Company, but it looks like the Army is going to call me about the end of Hardi.... Passed my preUminary medical exam last week. I tried to enlist in the Naval Reserve as a yeoman, but they turned me down on my eyes. But with the new Army standard for eyes, I guess they'll be O.K. rm raady to go and glad to get a chance to do ray part." 
"Second lieut. David Bilger, of St. Augustine, was transferred, Feb. 2, to the Finance Office, Camp Croft, S. C, where he is assistant finance officer. 
*%harl« Bennett, '39, is in his last semester of law at the University of Florida, and L. J. Beilly, '40, is still here in St. Augustine and working for Marine Studios and not in the Air Corps as was erroneously reported to the 'Alumnus'." 
David O'Cmnor has been in the Army since Oct. 
1. 1941. He had his bade training at Fort Warren, Cheyenne, Wyo. At present he is stationed at Fort McDowell, Calif., where he is company supply derk for the First Company Quartermaster Corp. 
Oudie Dake has a dvi! service job, beinx a dvil aeronanties controller, at the municipal air^ port In diicago. 

The Notre Dame Alumnus 
From Hml WillUiu: 
Hie correspondence and news for this month is very scanty, but I'll eive yon what I have and then pot in a plug for more letters. 
More than a month ago 1 received this wedding announcement, "Mr. and Hra. Fisher Jones Beas­ley announce the marriage of their daughter Uary Fuller and Hr. Bernard Francis Peteraon on Sat­urday, the foorteenth of February, 1942, at Balt!-' mora.*' No address on the newly married couple, but I understand that they are U\ing in Baltimore. 
niia from Frank Larwood (725 D Street, Spring­
iield, Oregon); "Having just read the February 
'Alumnus' and having just accumulated some 
news, thought it time for you to hear again from 
the Oregon country. Miss Evelyn L. Wright and 
I were married Feb. 14 at her home in Portland, 
Ore, We are having to be a week-*nd couple for 
.the present, however, since she is keeping her job 
in Portland in anticipation of my being called 
into the army. I am another of Dr. Cooney's boys 
who has left the joamaUsm field, and I have been 
working for the Southern Pacific Railroad since 
last August. My main job is the routing and bill­
ing of car loads of lumber and plywood. As X 
work nights 1 am taking a shorthand course at a 
business college in Eugene, which is four miles 
wbst of Springfield. 
"Sorry I haven't much news about other N, D. boys, but 1 am rather isolated from Notre Dame events here and have to depend on the 'Alumnus' for my news. I did have a letter from my old roommate Redman Duggan, who is still with the Social Security Board at Alamosa, Col. He has recently had his territory enlarged and now has considerable traveling to do. I'll appreciate a let­ter or a personal visit from any of the boys who might get out this way either through Uncle Sam or on their own. They can find me by inquiring at either the Springfield or Eugene depots ot the Southern Pacific" 
. Thanks, Frank, for the fine letter. And congrat­ulations to both of the boys who will have an easy date to remember as their wedding anniversaries St. Valentine's Day. 
Then there is a letter from Pvt. John Ckary who, when last heard from, was stationed at Fort Andrews, Mass., with the service company of the 104th Infantry. 
I saw Chnck Braeins the other day strolling up a Baltimore street during the lunch hour. He said that he is still with Haskins and Sells and doing quite a bit of traveling these days and just moved into a new house in Stoneleigfa, just outside ot Baltimore. He reports that his young son is growing bigger and better every day. While I was in Frederick, Md., last week I learned that Jack LeMien is now an Ensign in the Navy and ia attending school in Boston. 
As for myself: I was inducted into the army Feb. 6 at Fort George G. Heade, Md., just outside of Baltimore. Three weeks later I was transferred to Fort Eustis, Va., about 70 miles below Mch­mond, and March 25 was transferred to Baltimore with the rank of sergeant to work in the Third Corps Area Headquarters. Not bad. this Army life, when one can live at homel 
That's about all for the time being except that I am issuing an urgent appeal for correspondence. The boys have been slacking up lately. Come on, fellows, drop us a line even if it is only a card.

Stands for the Navy, at Notre Dame 
With the Navy Department's announcement that Notre Dame has been named ofEcially as a V-1 center, Notre Dame now offers undergraduates several attractive opportunities to pursue their education and at the same time to prepare themselves and their talents for the service of the government. The Navy Department, through Secretary Knox, Admiral Jacobs, Admiral Downes, Admiral Nimitz, and many other spokesmen, has expressed its appreciation 
of the cooperation of the University. 
V-1 * 
PRE-INDOCTRINATION TRAINING 
"This is !he latest procurement plana plan whereby the Navy hopes lo obtain 80. 000 pre-indoctrinated trainees-per year. Col­lege freshmen and sophomores between the ages of 17 and 19 inclusive who are of good moral character and in good physical con­dition may enlist in Class V-1 as apprentice seamen. After aproximately three semesters, during which they will study related Navy subjects, taught by the regular college faculty. V-1 men will be given a general examination. Those ranking sufficiently high in the exam­ination may transfer to Class V-5 or V-7 (see below) and continue their inactive status until completion of the academic requirements for those classes. Those whose scores on the examination are too low to warrant V-5 or V-7 training will be allowed to compete the 4-semester indoctrination course and then be called to active duty as apprentice seamen." (For further information or enlistment consult your nearest Navj* recruiting office or address Rev. James D. Trahey, C. S. C Notre Dame. Indiana.) 
V-5 * 
NAVAL AVIATION 
"Most Navy men regard this classification as TH E gilt-edge opportunity in the Naval Reserve. Contrary lo popular belief, you don't have lo be a super man to get in. You must, however, be between the ages of 19 and 26 inclusive, unmarried, and in good shape physically, if you haven't yet finished the required two years of college, you may enlist now and continue school until you have. You will receive 90 days training at one of the 16 reserve aviation bases, then be shipped lo the 'Annapolis of the Air' (at Pensacola. Fla.) or lo 'Jax' (Jacksonville. Fla.) or 'Corpus' (Corpus Christi. Tex.) for ad­vanced training. Upon receiving your Navy 'wings' and commission, you will also begin receiving $245 a month. Any Navy re­cruiting office will steer you (transportation paid) to the nearest Naval Aviation Cadet 
Selection Board."

A unit of the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps was established in Sep­tember at the University by order of Secretary Knox. Present Navy plans hare frozen these units both in number and in size. Consequently, at Notre Dame, freshmen, entering in September, are eligible for this training upon accept­ance after proper qualification, only with­in quota limits which permit a maximum unit strength of only about 10% of the University enrollment. For a limited number of the N.R.O.T.C. graduates there are three possibilities: commission as line officers in the regular naval ser­vice; commission as officers in the Supply 
Corps of the Regular Navy, and com­mission as officers in the Regular Marine Corps Service. The Department of Nav­al Science and Tactics is an integral part of the University, and four years of satisfactory work (academic years) will result in both the bachelor's degree and the ensign's commission. Further details of the N.R.O.T.C. may be secured from the Registrar, Notre Dame, hid., or Capt. H. P. Burnett, U.S.N., command­er of the Notre Dame unit. (Capt. Bur­nett is also general commandant on the University campus, including in his com­mand the tiew V-7 program beginning 
April 75.;

MIDSHIPMAN TRAINING 

"Graduates of the three midshipman schools have won numerous citations for their activities aboard destroyers and 'mosquito' boats in the Pacific. If you are junior, seni­or, or graduate student between the ages of 20 and 27 inclusive, you may enlist now and be deferred from active duty until receipt of your degree. In earning the sheepskin, you must complete two semesters of math, includ­ing one course in plane trigonometry. You will then be given 30 days indoctrination at Notre Dame University and sent to one of the midshipman schoolsat Northwestern or Columbia University or aboard the USS Prairie State in New York City. Upon completion of this 90-day course in seaman­ship, navigation, ordnance and gunnery, you will be commissioned an ensign in the Naval Reserve, with salary and allowances totaling $183 per month. In peace lime men go to .Annapolis for four years to earn the same commission in the regular Navy. Any Navy recruiting office can accept preliminary appli­cations for V-7 enlistment. 
"Whether or not they are called to im­mediate active duly, all men are draft-exempt after enlisting in the Naval Reserve. All agree to serve for the duration of the war except aviation cadets who agree to serve for 4 years unless released sooner by the Navy Department."

 It should also be noted that the V-1, V­5 and V-7 classifications permit the student to complete his work on an inactive status, at his own expense.
