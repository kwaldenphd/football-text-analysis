1,817 Students Start New Term; 140 V-12 
For First Time Since 1943, Civilian Group is Larger tiian Navy Group; Final Midshipmen Class Enters; 183 Degrees Conferred on June 22. 
For the first time since the naval V-12 program was initiated at Notre Dame two years ago, the majority of students enrolled in University courses are, in the semester which started on July 5, civil­ians. The local V-IZ quota, originally set at 1,850, has now dwindled to 140. These, added to the 660 students in the naval EOTC program, provide a uni­formed contingent of only 800 Notre Dame students. 
Civilian students (including relig^ious and laymen, graduate students and un­dergraduates) number 1,017, for a total enrollment in the regular term of 1,817. A special six-week summer session has enrolled 68 students, mostly religious, to bring the final summer registration to 1,885. This compares with a normal, peacetime registration of 3,000 to 3,200, plus a summer student body of close to a thousand in some years. 
As you have read in earlier issues of the ALUMNUS, the V-12 program will be discontinued with the end of the present term, in October. The Naval Reserve Midshipmen's School, established on the campus since 1942, will likewise be dis­continued in early November. The final-midshipman class came to Notre Dame July 12 for its four-month period of train­ing, prior to commissioning. (It is to be remembered that midshipmen are not enrolled as Notre Dame students. Taught entirely by naval personnel, they uti­lize certain leased facilities on the cam­pus for lodging, meals, drill, and the like.) 
There are 578 new freshmen in the University this term, more than half the total civilian enrollment. Yet, the new freshmen group, though large by war­time standards, is about'300 below the normal peacetime figure. And the new group, are of course, young—a few only 15—which means that the great majority of the current new freshmen will remain at Notre Dame only until their draft board calls them. 
Sixty-seven second semester freshmen have returned for the present term, plus 150 sophomores, 84 juniors, 59 seniors and 27 law students. 
A total of 150 discharged veterans are studying at the University this semester under the provision of the GI Bill of Rights and the Veterans Rehabilitation Act. This figure compares with 107 vet­erans enrolled in the semester just pre­vious, and it represents an increase of 300 per cent since the first dischargees arrived at Notre Dame in July, 1944. 
The V-12 and the NROTC are, togeth­er, occupying only Alumni and DiUon halls this semester, the RO's having given Walsh back to the civilians. The midshipmen continue to occupy Lyons, Morrisseyj Howard and Badin. With the large influx of freshmen, Carroll Hall is again being utilized temporarily, with Brother Justin, C.S.C, as rector. Fresh­men are also in Breen-Phillips, Cava­naugh and Zahm. Sorin and St. Ed­ward's continue, as' well as Walsh, to house upperclassmen. 
A total of 183 degrees were conferred. at the summer convocation held in Washington Hall on June 22. Eighty-one of the 183 were bachelor of naval sci­ence awards to men of the NROTC who had been on active duty for one semes­ter. These 81 students completed in Feb­ruary the academic work necessary for the naval science degree and were com­missioned then as ensigns. The great majority of the naval science degrees were conferred in abselntia. 
The convocation address was delivered by Rev. Philip Moore, C.S.C, dean of the Graduate School. (Extracts from this remarkable address will be found elsewhere in this issue.) Rev. Hugh O'Donnell, C.S.C, celebrated Mass for the class in Sacred Heart Church at 8 A.M. on June 22, Rev. Thomas Irving, C.S.C, conducted the traditional last visit to Sacred Heart Church at 8:30 A.M., and at 9 o'clock all the graduates were guests of the University at a Com­munion-breakfast in the University Din­ing Hall. At 4 P.M. a reception for the graduates and their families was held in the Rockne Memorial lovmge. 
Dr. Aaron Ignatius Abell joined the faculty of the Department of History with the start of the summer term. 
A graduate of Harvard, Dr. Abell is particularly noted in the field of cultural and social history of the' United States since the Civil War. He comes to Notre Dame from Nazareth collie, Rochester, 
N. Y. Dr. Abell has served on the facul­ties at St. Norbert's college. New York University, and Rochester University. 
In addition to making contributions to various historical periodicals. Dr. Abell is the author of a book called The Urban Impact on Ameriean Protestantism, 1865rX900. 
Dr. Bernard J. Kohlbrenner is a new assistant professor in education. 
Dr. Kohlbrenner, who was graduated from Syracuse University, received a master of arts degree from the same institution in 1928. After teaching at St. Mary's Colege, Winona, Minn., in 19287 29, he served as instructor in education at Notre Dame from 1929 until 1933. From 1933 to 1940 he was on the staff at the University of St. Louis, and he received a doctor of philosophy degree from Harvard in 1942. 
Before coming^ to Notre Dame in the July semester Dr. Kohlbrenner 'was head of the Department of Education of New Rochelle CoUege, New Roehelle, N. Y.

Club Vocational Committes Are Nam^ 
Alumni Association Vocational Plan Is Based on Active Participation of Local Oubs; Basic Suggestions Are Sent to All Qub Presidents. 
Vocational committees, to assist in the adjustment of those alumni dislocated by World War II, have been formed or are being formed by many of the Notre Dame clubs in all parts of the country. 
The directors of the Alumni Associa­tion, at their meeting at Notre Dame on June 23-24 gave strong impetus to this movement, directing that Notre Dame clubs everywhere, with due regard for their individual size and location, should act at once to assist vocationally those alumni dislocated by reason of the war, and especially to assist the returning war veterans. William E. Dooley, assist­ant alumni secretary, was directed to co­ordinate the activity nationally. 
Proceeding at once to carry out the directive of the Board, Bill Dooley in late June sent to the presidents of all the Notre Dame clubs a suggested basic plan for carrying on this vocational pro­gram. This plan, admittedly experiment­al in details, was designed to provide at least a framework upon which any club, large, medium sized or small, could build an activity to assist the veterans and others, according to the needs of that club. Each president was asked, as an essential preliminary, to appoint a local chairman to direct the work. 
The response has been far from sen­sational so far. But some clubs have "hopped to it"—all praise to them!—and the following chairmen are already en­rolled or, in the case of New York City, Chicago, Cleveland and Western Penn­sylvania, re-enrolled: 
NEW YORK CITY: John T. B.lfe, '20. 60 E. 42nd St. 
CHICAGO: Edward F. O'Toole, '25, Room 807, 10 S. La Salle St. (Miss Jane Cahill is in charge of the club's perma­nent office here.) 
CLEVELAND: Clayton G. Leroux, '27, Assistant Personnel Director, Mon­arch Aluminum Mfg. Co. 
WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA: John 
F. McMahon, '28, Managing Director, Industrial Hygiene Foundation of Amer­ica, Inc., Mellon Institute, Pittsburgh. 
BUFFALO: Joseph F. Ryan, '39, SO Frontenac Ave. 
DETROIT: Henry F. Clark. '30. 324 Washington Square BIdg.. Royal Oak, Mich. 
MILWAUKEE: Edward J. Rogers. '17. President, Layne-Northwest Co., 709 N. 11th St. 
PHILADELPHIA: Harold E. Duke, '30, Manager, Wayne Pomp Co., 4030 
N. Broad St. 
PORTLAND, ORE.: WillUm C Schmitt, "10, President, Schmitt Steel Co. 
RHODE ISLAND & SOUTHEAST­ERN MASSACHUSETTS: J. Clement Grimes, 384 River Ave.. Providence, 
R. I. 
ST. JOSEPH VALLEY: Judge J. Elmer Peak, '12, Court House, South Bend. 
ST. LOUIS: Robert T. Hellrung. '30. St. Louis Medical Credit Bureau. Hum­boldt Medical BIdg. 
TWIN CITIES: Louis J. Regan. '29. Personnel Director, Sears, Roebuck and Co.. Minneapolis. 
WASHINGTON. D. C : Bernard E. Loshfaough. '29. National Public Hous­ing Conference, Inc., 1015 15th St.. 
N. W. 
The plan of operation, as outlined by Bill Dooley to the Alumni Board at its latest meeting, and approved by the Board, has these essential character­istics: 
1.
 It is founded on active and whole­hearted participation by the Notre Dame clubs. The Alumni Office at Notre Dame, while it will assist in every way possible, obviously cannot attempt to do the job alone; the job's too big and Notre Dame alumni are too widespread. And, more important, the job can usually be done more effectively in the home community or home region of the man who needs help. 

2.
 The program will of necessity be to a large extent advisory and "refer­ral" in nature. Much as the various Notre Dame agencies would like to pro­vide, directly and immediately, a job for every Notre Dame men who applies for one, there just is no hope, in the na­ture of things, of doing this. The objec­tive must, therefore, be to "help a man to help himself," by advice and "steers." 


When a man can be referred directly to a job opening, this will of coarse be done. 
Application forms, for the use of job seekers, have already been provided for cooperating clubs by Bill Dooley. One copy of this form will be retained by the club and one copy will be sent to Bill's coordinating otBee at Notre Dame. In this way, and in other ways to be set up as the program progresses, an inter­change of both job applicants and jobs can be effected through the clubs and the Alumni OfSce. 
More of all this later. The alI-imi>or­tant thing right at the moment is to get your own club "going." Check with your president to find out whether he's ap-" pointed your vocational chairman. If he hasn't, get out the needle. 
The time is now. The "postwar per­iod" of which we've talked for so long is with uis in effect. Many of the thou­sands being discharged from the services are Notre Dame men, and Notre Dame veterans looking for jobs are appearing more frequently, week by week. The number of Notre Dame men (alumni, other former students and students taken away from their classes) who are serving or have served in this war is fast approaching the 10,000 mark. 
Let's put that Notre Dame Spirit into action! 
GIFT FROM SINCUIR 

The University has received from the Sinclair Kefining Co. the gift of a wall display illustrating the role of chemis­try in oil refining with regard, to the production and utilization of C^ hydro­carbons. The flow chart shows the pro­duction, from crude petroleum, of 100^ octane aviation gasoline, and of butadi­ene for synthetic rubber. The products resulting from the different steps in the process are illustrated by colored flow-lines which enable the observer to read­ily trace the source and utilization of the materiaL 
The University is grateful to Leiand Stanford, vice-president of the company, and to Hixson-O'Donnell Advertising, Inc., for the display. It is located in the main corridor of the Chemistry Building..

Chicdgo Club Opens Full-Time Office 
The Notre Dame Club of Chicago of­fice opened on Juno 4, 1945, in Room 807 at 10 S. LaSalle Street. 
And thus, for the first time in the history of the Alumni Association, a Notre Dame club has a permanent office, with a full-time secretary in charge. 
Miss Jane Cahill, who attended Saint Mary's, Notre Dame, (daughter of James Cahill, '14, La Salle, 111., sister of James Cahill, Jr., '43, and sister-in­law of Joseph Canale, '39) is the secre­tary. She is working under the super­vision of the Vocational Committee whose members are as follows: Edward O'Toole, '25, chairman; John Bourke '38, James Brennan '20, Frank Doan '29, Frank McCarthy, '06, Vincent Mur­phy '37, James Sanford '15, Fred Steers '11, Robert Stephan '27, and Arthur Weinrich '19. 
The officers of the Chicago Club are: Daniel Hilgartner '17, honorary presi­dent; John Dorgan '29, president; Jo­seph Shelly '25, first vice-president; Bruce Holmberg '23, second vice-presi­dent, Charles Collins '25, treasurer; arid Thomas McCabe '22, secretary. 
The basic purposes of the club's new office are to administer the vocational activity systematically and effectively for Chicago Club veterans and alumni generally; to handle the routine work necessary to make the Notre Dame Club of Chicago energetic and cohesive; and to be helpful to the club's membership in matters affecting their interest as Notre Dame alumni. The funds to finance the office are being voluntarily contributed by members of the club.' 
There are 1,175 names on the mailing list at the time of the opening of the office. After checking the addresses, it was found that 578 were correct, 148 had to be corrected, 260 men were in the service, and the remaining 180 are yet to be verified. There were 469 nev; names added to the list and the number of servicemen so far has reached 528. A special effort ^vill be made to get as complete a list as passible on all Notre Dame alumni in the Chicago metropoli­tan area and to keep that list up-to-date. 

Several applications for jobs have been received from Notre Dame alumni and the office has had numerous job leads from industries and professions in the city. There have been inquiries made on behalf of prospective students for the University. 
While the Chicago Club was confident that its members in service would need and want help, it took letters like the following to prove that the club must go all the way:

Your Part in Public Relations 
. (This article toas written by Art Haley at the: special request of the Board of Directors of the Alumni Association. The Board felt that the imporiant tasks assigned to Art should be better under­stood by alumni generally.) 
Father O'Donnell's address to the Notre Dame Club of Chicago on April 17, in which he made known Notre Dame's plans for postwar development, was one of the most important an­nouncements in the University's recent history. Reaction of the alumni, after reading the reprint in this magazine, was unanimously favorable. As a matter of fact, Jim Armstrong has already pointed out the remarkable parallel be­tween the administration's carefully de­termined program and the suggestions for the future made by several thousand graduates who gave thoughtful answers in the recent, "pattem-for-progress" questionnaire. 
In the minds of many, however, is the inevitable question: "Where are we going to get the money?" After all, $12,000,000 for the Graduate School, $10,000,000 for new buildings, $3,000,­000 for endowed chairs—^to mention only three items on the agenda—are not sums to regard lightly. 
Getting the money is a long process that requires continuous cooperation for which a centralizing body, the Depart­ment of Public Relations, was estab­lished in January, 1941. During this time it has been maintaining, establishing, and sometimes renewing contact with persons who have indicated a friendly feeling toward Notre Dame. Our files were built up from a score of other Uni­versity files—including parents of stu­dents, donors to the first endowment fund and the Rockne Memorial, names from the files of the ofiBce of the Presi­dent and the Vice-President, and names suggested by members of the Associate Board of Lay Trustees, and so on. Here­in are to be found the names of those who through the years, and especially recent years, have contributed substan­tially to the University's progress. 
The Department of Public Relations was once described by Father O'Donnell 
By J. ARTHUR HALEY, '26 

Director, Department of Public Relations University of Notre Dame 
as the agency through which Notre Dame makes known to her friends the place that she holds in American educa­tional life, and the developments she has in mind that will help her keep that place and increase the sphere of her in­fluence. He added that every person con­nected with the University is, ex officio, a member of the department, from Pres­ident to policeman on the g^rounds. 
J. ARTHim HAI£Y 

"Every person connected .with the University" includes administration, fac­ulty, students, and alumni. Of the four groups, the alumni, numerically the largest, can be most influential because of the individual alumnus' knowledge of the aims and ideals of Notre Dame, and his virtually unlimited opportunities to make them known to those who appre­ciate society's need for men with a Notre Dame background. 
Notre Dame has made, and is making, an important contribution to society by providing it with men—lawyers, teach­ers, business men, scientists, engineers, and others—^who have not only a sound professional training, but a sound edu­cation as well. Given the opportunity, she will make an even grreater contribu­tion, consolidating the gains she has al­ready made, and then, within her pat­tern, going forward. She can take ad­vantage of her opportunity only if she has the active help of those who know the merits of Notre Dame and who real­ize the urgent need -of providing the United States with leaders in whom sound principles have been imbued. Fur­thermore, the number of such under­standing persons must constantly be in­creased. It is only through a multiplica­tion of benefactors that private schools can hope to continue in their present role. 
Hence, the alumnus becomes the liai­son between Notre Dame and the inter­ested friend and potential benefactor. One of the most important tasks of the Department of Public Relations is to supplement the fine work of the Alunmi Association in providing alumni with in­formation, general or specific, that will be useful in explaining to non-alumni what the University is, what it does, and what it stands for. Sometimes this in­formation is provided in pamphlet form for general distribution. Two years ago, for example, the Department published a booklet called "Is Notre Dame More Than a Name to You?" answering ques­tions regarding Notre Dame's income and expenditures, the administration of endowment funds, the disposition of re­ceipts from athletics, and so on. Appar­ently it was helpful because the requests for extra copies made it necessary to order a second printing within three weeks. A pamphlet published annually explaining the tax deductions allowable to individuals and corporations on gifts to educational, religions, and charitable institutions has also proved its worth. 
It is a tribute to the loyalty of some alumni that they inform this office of the names of men and women who have ex­pressed an interest in Notre Dame and wish to help in the work she is doing. HOW much of this interest is the direct result of alunmi missionary work no one will ever know, but the value ot such work is certainly considerable. When such, a friend is particularly interested, let us say, iu helping ndedy and deserv­ing students, we pass on to him, or to the alumnus who brought him to our at­tention, a suggested plan for a scholar­ship, or an explanation of the benefits that many boys have derived from the student loan fund.

Functiondl Education 
By REV. PHILIP S. MOORE. C.S.C. Dean of the Graduate School 
(Editor's Note: Father Moore's scholar-Ill address to the graduates at the June Convocation of 1943 tcill suffer from the editorial necessity of condensing mats-rial for this issue. We have tried to select those paragraphs from his address which were not only applicable to the neto graduate, but which contain mate­rial readily adaptable to alumni of all years, in all walks of life, among whom the Alumni Association is attempti7ig to arouse the intellectual leadership Father Moore discusses.) 
"In ancient Greece an educational movement arose which claimed that the chief purpose of ecucation was to train young men to proficiency in living with­in a democratic society. This movement was sophism. It might have served a praiseworthy purpose if it had been grounded in a sound philosophy of edu­cation, but lacking this foundation, it degenerated into a crass utilitarianism or pragmatism, and education became a means to success over one's fellows, without regard to truth, justice or rights. In the Middle Ages another group of utilitarian teachers sprang up. These we call the comificians. For them, too, the chief aim of education was to prepare men for practical success—to teach them to make a living. And in modem times we have those among us who look upon education primari'y as a preparation for bigger and bettsr jobr. 
"Now, undoubtedly one of the "pur­poses of education is to prepare us for our future life's work and we can legiti­mately hope that it will enable us to make a better li\'ing than we could other­wise have. But, if we make practical success in life the first or most impor­tant end of education, we fall into the error of the sophists and the comifi­cians; we fail to understand or appre­ciate the essential purposes of educa­
tion and the effect education should have on us as human beings, on the culture of our human faculties. 
". . . Education, is primai-ily an active process—the realization of what is in us, the perfecting of our powers of mind, or, as the philosophers say, the actuali­zation of our potentialities. Its. funda­mental purpose is an immanent develop­ment, which begins and ends within the human person himself. One's personal life is improved, because this develop-
m.ent of the faculties increases our in­sight; our ability to observe; our abili­ty to define; our ability to see facts with­out emotional discoloration; to sort facts; to deduce the meaning of facts; our ability to see trends; our ability to foresee logical and psychological effect* of present facts; to progress from causes to effects and from effects to causes; the ability to study things, people, and

events from more than one angle of \'ision—the social, the economic, the political, the literary, the metaphysical, the theological or supernatural. 
". . . Only the intellectually mature will deal adequately with the great prob­lems which will beset you. 
". . . Intelligence, trained and culti­vated intellectual insight, aided by the grace we pray God to give you, must be your faithful helpmate. Intelligence dominating emotion, intelligence holding back the tides of prejudice, mood, hate, bitterness. We don't have to have any 
lost generation after this war; the 'lost generation' of the last war was only partly genuine; it was to a great ex­tent a literary attitude, and a young people suddenly thrust into a knowledge of the prevalence of evil, pain, lust, greed, escaping into unreality. But to resist this we need every atom of intel­lectual and emotional maturity. 
The Notre Dame Alumnus 

". . . We must all understand that we must keep our intellectual powers in fine polish. It is one thing to learn the prin­ciples of truth, justice, charity; it de­mands a finely-pointed wisdom to under­stand new situations and to bring these principles to bear upon them. Don't let the cynics influence you; they arj; armed with the slogans that tempt the unwary, lest anyone dare to speak up for the underprivileged, the out­classed, in the interest of universal jus­tice and charity and Christian brotherly love. Cynicism is the refuge of the weak, of the vain whose feelings have been hurt, of the minds that are too tired or have become too used to comfort to meet new situations with the vigor of a truth-loving mind. 
". . . The cynic cannot 'rise with the occasion,' he is too exhausted from com­fort or too much in fear lest his incom­petency be brought up against situations he has no heart to meet. But you have your Faith and your education to guide you. These are your compass and sex­tant: they give you your bearings. You need not fear new problems, personal problems, our national problems, our world problems; you need not fear 'to think anew and act anew.' Leave fear to the cynics, the self-insulated and iso­lated. The greatest contribution you can make, to your Church-, your country, 
.and yourselves, is to bring the full power of your Faith and an ever-growing per­sonal education, begun here, into a fear­less love of truth, a fearless energy in meeting problems honestly and without evasion." 
PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT 
Rev. J. Hugh O'Donnell, C.S.C, president of the University, issued the following: statement in late July: 
"/ am amazed at the report which appears in the current neios release of the Department of Press of the National Catholic Welfare Conference to the effect that the University of Notre Dame has ac­quired the Dmry estate in Cleve­land as a site for a neiv prepara­tory school for boys. It has no foundation whatsoever. The Uni­versity has sufficient problems of its oivn during this critical period withoiit invading the field of sec­ondary education. Moreover, in ac­cordance with traditional practice, 

the  President  of  the  University  is  
the  only  competent  authority  to  
speak  for  Notre  Dame."

ATHLETICS 
After three weeks of summer football drills, and with two more weeks of work­outs scheduled as the ALUMNUS went to press. Coach Hugh Devore and his staff had a pretty good line on Notre Dame's grid material for the coming fall season. And, it might be quickly added, they weren't turning any handsprings. But on the other hand, they didn't have the crying towel out either. 
Eight lettei-men were in the group of 109 candidates, and another monogram winner, gruard Fred Rovai, vrill report when the squad convenes on September 4 for fall workouts. The veterans include: center, Frank Szymanski; fullbacks, Marty Wendell and Elmer Angsman; quarterbacks, Frank Dancewicz and Joe Gasparella; guard, John Mastrangelo; tackle, Pete Berezney; and end. Bob Skoglund. 
Devore's big problem is to find a run­ning back to replace men like Bob Kelly and Jimmy Brennan from the '44 team, and to unearth some tackles and ends. There isn't a single halfback returning from last year's squad, but there is a likely looking bunch of first year men, any one of whom might make the grade. 
Notre Dame's strength seems to be "up in the middle," where Szymanski, Dancewicz and Wendell, all outstanding in their play last year, will again hold forth. Each should be an outstanding candidate for all-American honors, un­less rigor mortis sets in somewhere dur­ing the season. 
Left end. Bob Skoglund, is the only re­turning wingman, and he will be avail­able only until the first part of Novem­ber, when he is due to receive his en­sign's commission in the Navy's KOTC. Meanwhile, Coach Harry Jaconski is trying to dig up some talent from a group of newcomers, most of whom are right out of high school. 
Best of the group appears to be Matt Maryanski, Bloomfield, N. J., who is now at right end. Others showing prom­ise are Phil O'Connor, from Indianap­olis, and Bruno Opela, from Chicago's Lane Tech. 
Chicago boys • dominate the tackle 

scene, where Pete Berezney is the only vet back. Berezney, now tipping the scales at 220, will be the regular ri^ t tackle. Ed Mieszkowsld, who was on the squad the past two years but did not see much action, is currentiy holding down the other varsity. He is from Tilden Tech, Chicago. Two other boys from the Windy City are battling for spots, one being 255-poand Bill Fischer, from Lane Tech, while the other is John Vainisi, a 220-ponnder from S t George. 
The Irish seem fairly well set at the guard jobs, where Fred Rovai and John Mastrangelo, both of whom played regu­larly last year, are due for repeat per­formances. Challenging them-are Tom Potter, 195-pound Army dischargee from Kearney, N. J., and John Fallon, a 210­pound converted tackle from Alton, 111. The latter was on the squad last year, and has improved tremendously, and may win a starting berth. 
Frank Szymanski, one of the conn­try's best centers last year, has the pivot post salted away. Tom Walsh, 215­ponnd, 17-years-old freshman from 
The 194S football coaching staff consists oi left to right HORT Jacnnaki, Walter Sembo. Head Coach Hugh Devore, Ken Stilley, Gene Bonsani and lake XUne. 
The Notre Dame Alumnus 

Phillipsburgh, N. J., is the best of the younger crop, with Tom Schreiber, of 
Student Personnel Office Opens 
Detroit, a holdover from last year, also in the picture. 
By EDWARD R. QUINN, '28 
Notre Dame's greatest strength seems to be in its quarterbacks. Frank Dance­wicz, a great passer, runner, strategist and defensive star throughout the 1944 schedule, will again hold down the No. 1 job. Also available is Joe Gasparella, brilliant freshman star from last fall, who spelled Dancewicz; Roger Cadieux, a sophomore from Springfield, Mass., and George Ratterman, Navy EOTC trainee from Cincinnati, are battling for the No. 3 job. Both are fine passers, and good all around prospects. Ratter­man is trying to win his fourth N. D. monogram, having previously lettered in basketball, baseball and tennis. 
Two of the standout freshmen half­backs are Phil CoUela, 175-pound speedr ster from Rochester, Pa., and John "Pep" Panelli, 200-pound prospact from Morristown, N. J. Collela was the lead­ing high school scorer in Pennsylvania in 1943, before going into the armed service, and he gives every indication of being a potentially great college player. Panelli, a dead ringer for Jim Mello, is a husky gent who has shown great promise as a pass receiver ami break-away runner in the drills to date. Collela currently is at left halfback, with Panelli at right halfback. 
Elmer Angsman, shifted from full­back to right halfback, is battling Panel­li for the varsity post right away, while Bill Gompers, a 17-year-old freshman from Wheeling, W. V., also figures in Coach Devore's plans. Among the left halfbacks who have impressed during the scrimmage sessions this summer are Terry Brennan, 185-pound speedboy from Milwaukee, brother of Jimmy Brennan of the 1944 team, and John Agnone,- Youngstown, 0., who.was on 
the squad but did not play last fall. 
The fullback department should be well equipped. Marty Wendell, who will start the season, barring the unforeseen, was one of the greatest line-backers in college ball last year. During the late season he also blossomed forth as a ball ca?:rier, and this spring and summer has continued to show great ability as a line plunger as well as an open field runner. Backing Wendell is Frank Eug­gerio. East Orange, N. J., junior, who after two years of disappointments, 
seems set for a good season. Fred Schmid, 18-year-old, 220-pound freshman from Trenton, N. J., is giving Ruggerio a headache as they compete for the num­ber two spot under Wendell. 
It is a matter of common knowledge among alumni that ths University has always encouraged an intimate teacher-student advisory relationship, with the gratifying resixlt that many religions and lay teachers throughout Notre Dame's history have unselfishly devoted niuch of their time to counseling serv­ices outside the classroom. Whenever it has been possible, both teachers and administrators have likewise offered their every assistance to the student in his search for a position after gradua­tion. Such informal teacher-student contacts have been highly effective in the furtherance of the Notre Dame family tradition, and undoubtedly should 
EDWABD R. QUINN 

be continued in the future as important adjuncts to the teaching and administra­tive functions. 
University officials have, however, for several years been cognizant of the fact that it is becoming increasingly difficult for each instructor to gain an intimate knowledge of every student assigned to him for instruction. The pressures of teaching duties, the neces­sity to do research and the increasing sizes of class sections have all militated against such a desideratum. A further handicap in the form of inadequate personal histories of the students and alumni has occasionally confronted the 
University. 
It was, therefore, with these and other similar considerations in mind that, at the direction of Father Hugh O'Don­
nell, C.S.C, president of the University, . backed by the recommendations of the Alumni Association's Vocational Com­mittee, the Office of Student Personnel was recently established on the campus. This oiSce, which in no way supplants, but rather complements, the informal counseling services, has for its purpose 
1. To provide an adequate cumula­tive record of each student as he pro­gresses through the University. This record, obtained from various sources by the Record Division of the Office of Student Personnel, consists of the stu­dent's scholastic record, his health and physical record, his extra-curricular activity and interest record, his test record, his work'expSriences, his vital record, and his vocational choices. 
Estimates of the student, which are obtained from his instructors and hall rectors, are also included in the cumu­lative record. Father Joseph Kehoe, CS. C, Head of the Records Division of the Office of. Student Personnel, has delegated to Robert McAuliffe the active administration of this division. 
2.
 To provide a counseling service to the student, thereby enabling him to discover his abilities and his aptitudes early in his scholastic career. This service also assists the student through­out his'.college residencie "to determine upon -his courses of instruction in the light of his past achievements, his voca­tional interests and his economic re­sources. Father Howard Kenna, C. S. C, acting director of studies and head of the Counseling Division of the Office of Student Personnel, has delegated to Father John Lane, C.S.C, the active administration of this division. Father Lane is now assisted by Father Thomas Irving, C.S.C., Father Charles Carey, C.S.C, and Edward R. Quinn. 

3.
 To assist the student in finding appropriate employment when he leaves Notre Dame, and as often thereafter as may be of.'true benefit to the student and td^^e school. While the employ­ment division of the Office of Student Personnel cannot guarantee to each student a position in keeping with his 


i-abilities and training, it is now making and will continue to make everj effort to place the student satisfactorily. Father Frank GoodaU, C.S.C, is the active administrator of Undergraduate Placement, taking over the work done

The Notre Dame Alumnus 

/^N E of the nation's outstanding cam­
paigns on a community and neighboi'­hood level for assisting returning veter­ans of World War II is being carried on in Fort Wayne, Ind., under the guiding organizational genius of Harry G. Hog­an, '04, attorney and president of Fort Wayne's Dime Bank, whose son. Ens. John H. Hogan, ex. '45, was killed in a training crash on Jan. 29, 1944. The Fort Wayne movement on behalf of the war effort and soldier aid began immediately after Pearl Harbor with Mr. Hogan as general warden. The community move­ment was known from its inception until recently as the Fort Wayne Civilian De­fense Council. 
The Fort Wayne VAC has frequently been highly praised by Washington for its model organization. Many visitors have gone to Fort Wayns to examine Mr. Hogan's program at close hand, one of the most recent delegations comprising officials and leaders of the city of South Bend. 
There is a veteran's aid counselor in each of Fort Wayne's si.xteen hundred blocks and these, vnth the section, zone and district leaders, comprise an organ­ization of more than two thousand indi­viduals. The over-all direction is pro­vided by a Board of Governors compris-
HAKRY G. HOGAX, '04 

ing 35 men who have met weekly under Mr. Hogan's direction since the early days of the war. They recently held their one hundred and sixteenth meeting, and it is rare that they have less than full attendance. 
. An unusual part of the Fort Wayne set-up is the Board of Chaplains com­prising Lutheran, Methodist, Jewish, 
•Catholic and other clergymen.

TWTARTIN EMMET WALTER, Ph.B. ^^ '14, M.A. '15, LL.B. '15, managing editor of the Houston Chronicle, Hous­ton, Texas, was one of 12 leading editors of the U. S. newspapers and magazines who this spring gathered from Nazi con­centration camps first hand evidence of Nazi atrocities. 
Upon returning to Houston, Emmet wrote a series of remarkable articles for his paper, outlining in detail the almost unbelievable horror of what he and his associates had found in Germany. 
MARTIN EMMET WALTER, '14 

A veteran of World War 1—he served in France for a year—and the holder of the Croix de Guerre for bravery, Emmet began his newspaper career in 1919 when he joined the Houston Post. He joined the Chronicle in 1922, becoming city edi­tor in 1924 and news and city editor in 1934. He was named managing editor on March 21, 1945. He is vice-chairman of the city planning commission and sub­committee chairman of Houston's post­war improvement committee. 
TTAROLD S. FOLEY, '21, has been 
since 1940 president of the Powell River Co., with headquarters in Vancou­ver, B.C., one of the largest producers of newsprint and unbleached sulphite pulp on the West Coast. 
With his brothers, Lester W. '24, and Milton J., '33, Harold is a member of the Foley family of Florida, outstanding in the lumber business, and Harold worked in the family enterprises in Florida until he went to Vancouver in 1936 as execu­tive vice-president of the Powell River Co. 
Says the Pulp and Paper Bulletin of Harold: "Throughout his comparatively brief bxit outstandingly active and fruit-
HAROLD S. FOLEY, '21 

ful career Harold Foley has displayed an 
almost uncanny knack for the reorgan­
ization and revitilization of business 
enterprises. Among his many personal 
assets is his deep, instinctive knowledge 
of people and his ability to get along 
with them .. . he is a hard-working, 
dynamic and unusually successful busi­
ness e.\ecutive with varied and wide­
spread interests." 
Harold and his wife have two sons and 

a daughter.

Bert V. Dunne, '26, San Francisco ad­vertising executive and sports columnist, one of George Keogan's sluggers of the ' '20s, is the author of a new book, Plaij Ball, Son, which purports to teach 11-14 year olds the science of becoming Ruths and Di Maggies. Bert's book hasn't ar­rived itself, just out July 15, but it sounds like the peppy approach and has lots of approbation. It costs $2.56 from the Serra Publishing Co., 57 Post St.,

As a matter of fact, I pray to God not for life but for peace of mind and freedom from fear of death while I am living, and the thought has come to me—^I believe an inspiration from God— that our purpose here on earth is to die and be united with Him and that death, far from being something to fear, is a cause for rejoicing in that it is a step to eternal happiness."

Alumni Board Meets 

The most aggressive and construc­tive board of directors in the history of the Alumni Association (and that isn't just because Dooley and I work for them) met on the campus on June 23 and 24. Tied in with the Board meeting was the University's academic convoca­tion and the informal gathering of the Class of 1920. 
Father Hugh O'Donnell, the extreme­ly active honorary president of the -Association, stimulated the entire meet­ing with a discussion of University problems and the application of the Association's program to the broader needs of the era in the world outside. -Aggressive leadership of alumni in meeting their opportunities was the key­note of his suggestions. 
The Board was very pleased and im­pressed with the quality of the returns from the Questionnaires sent to the alumni not in the service. But disap­pointment was expressed in the total return—only about 15% to date. Because of the significance of the Questionnaire in forming the alumni and University viewpoints, the Alumni Office was in­structed to study a possible remailing of the Questionnaire, which will be done (it is planned now) by September. 
William E. Dooley explained the me­chanics of the proposed program for enlisting the Local Clubs in the assist­ance of Notre Dame veterans of World War II in securing jobs or returning to Notre Dame to school. 
Following one of the suggestions that appeared in many of the Questionnaires on increasing the acadamic publicity and prestige of the University, the Board requested the cooperation of the depart­ment of publicity of the University in measuring for several months the con­tent of such news in the nation's press. 
Father Frank Goodall reported on the intensive programs set up as a result of the recommendation of the Associa­tion's Vocational Committee headed by Bernard J. VoU. 
Clarence E. Manion, chairman of the advisory committee for the revision of the constitution and byJaws of the .Association, met with the Board in a long discussion, and was commissioned to write the new forms. 
A project to place a replica of the Dome in the home of every alumnus was farthered by the submission of two models prepared by Joseph Kigali,' '27, Chicago. There is some discussion as to the use of these models, which are about six inches in height, shaped like the Dome and tentatively finished in gold leaf or sprayed bronze. President Tom Byrne suggests them as.the nucleus of a shrine of Our Lady in the home. Other suggestions range through simply the ornamental to the utilitarian. Member­ship suggestions woulil be of value. 
Absence from Detroit kept John T. Higgins away from the meeting, and Governor Harry Kelly was preparing for the governors' conference at Mackin­ac Island. Those attending were Father O'DonneD, Thomas Byrne, Rev. M. L. Moriarty, E. Bradley Bailey, John T. Balfe, WiUiam J. Mooney, Gerald Ashe, Father. Goodall, William R. Dooley and James E. Armstrong. 
ADDITIONAL SPORTS GOLF 
The Notre Dame golfers, defending champions, finished fourth this year in the NCAA championship tournament, held the latter part of June in Colum­bus, O. Capt Tom Kennedy and Dick Whiting advanced to the quarter-finals before being eliminated. 
TENNIS 
The tennis team, defending the title it shared in 1944 with Texas and Miami, failed to place this year in the NCAA tournament, held in Evanston, HI., the last week in June. Charley Samson and Bill Tully advanced to the quarter finals of the doubles, to turn in the best per­formance for the Irish. 
BASEBALL 
Coach Jake Kline's informal baseball team is playing a 14-game schedule this summer against midwestem service and camp teams. Highlight of the early part of the schedule was a 20-inning game played against Stout Field, Indianap­olis, and won by Notre Dame, 1-0. All kinds of Notre Dame records were broken in the game. Jack Barrett, Irish mound ace, pitched no hit ball for the regulation nine innings, then was forced to stop in the 15th, because of a sore arm. Duke Simpson, 17-year-old fresh­man, took over the duties and won his own game in the 20th when he blasted a single over the right fielder's head. Kt­cher Bob Hubbard, six-foot six-inch southpaw, of Stout Field, worked the en­tire 20 innings, gave nine hits, and * walked one.

yOUR PART IN PUBLIC RELATIONS 
(Gontintied from Fase 7) 

If a prospective benefactor is inter­ested in contributing to scientific re­search, we can, with no trouble at all, present a list of projects that await only the necessary funds. Perhaps a lawyer, an alumnus, tells us that a client wishes to remember Notre Dame in his will, and adds that he has no specific wishes as to how the benefaction be used. We recom­mend that it be added to the unrestrict­ed endowment funds. It is through un­restricted funds that the University is enabled to meet the varied and unantici­pated needs or opportunities that con­stantly present themselves. This De­partment has published "A Century of Consecrated Service," specifically de­signed to aid benefactors or their coun­selors in preparing wills remembering Notre Dame. In passing, I might add that a few Notre Dame lawyers have not been blind to the opportunities of mak­ing gifts during the lifetime of the donor. 
These few instances—and they might be multiplied many times over—indicate the relationships that should exist be­tween the alumni and the Department of Public Kelations—a mutual helpfulness that results in good to Notre Dame. Now that Father O'Donnell has announced a definite program, as well as the reasons for it, that relationship must be, and will be, even closer. We know where we want to go and what it will take to get there. 
If I were asked what every alumnus can do to be of service to Notre Dame in helping her advance toward her objec­tives, my answer would be, first, to be well suppUed with information concern­ing the University and its problons and opportunities. One never knows when seed is going to fall on fertile soil; that is, when the right word about Notre Dame spoken to the right person at the right time will arouse an interest that will result in a lasting friendship for the University. One of the aims of this Department is to increase the number of annual contributions varying in amounts as do alumni gifts. 
With full mutual efforts these plans for Notre Dame's future will some day be realized. The degrree to which alumni and the many non-alumni friends of the University cooperate will largely dictate the date.

I'm able to do very little %valklng but get out for auto rides. I was able to say Mass on June S, the feast of the Sacred Heart, and have been able to say it ever>- day since.

"Not much news these days. I was very sorry to hear of Sherman Steele's death. I had a very pleasant visit with him several years ago when he came here for the baths. He was a nephew of General Sherman and, strange to say, his close friend and pal in the class was Ctiarlie Bryan who was the nephew of the Confederate Admiral Semmes of Alabama f.tme.

"Yesterday I had the opportunity of calling 
upon BKhop Crowley, '02, who after 38 years 
in India, has not lost a trace of his rich lovely 
Irish brogue, nor his Irish facility of phrase. 
To the young solders from the nearby ATC 
base with us at bis residence, the bishop re­
marked: 'I always say: If you want to live 
to be an old soldier, keep away from the big 
guns.' The Bishop was on his way that after­
noon to the ATC airport near Dacca, from 
which It had been arranged he would be flown 
to another part of bis vast diocese. .. . At 
his residence. I also met Dathcr Switalski, '22, 
and at the residence In town near the cathedral 
and school. Brother Lorenzo, Brother Jade and 
Father Benpnan. They all want to be re­
membered to their old school, which always 
remains high in their hearts as evidenced by 
the copies of the 'Alumnus' that I saw on the 
table both at the school and at the bishop's 
residence. 

"And now, too, it must be said, these men of Notre Dame are doing a great job, not only among the Indian people, but also among the young Catholic men at the nearby base. I ran into several at the bishop's house and It lifted your soul to see them—these fine young men who were finding so much joy In talking with. His Grace, these Fathers and these Brothers. It was an inspiring experience after having run across so much of the other sort of spirit in the army—not that it Is general, for mostly I think we can be well proud of our young men—but that any amount of it Is disturbing. Notre Dame out here—and Fm sure elsewhere over the world—as through Bisdiop 0*Han^~ has been doing Its part gloriously. , . 
"I'm on an unusual trip. I left the San Francisco conference before it was over to fly to "Washington, from which I've flown since to Bermuda, the Azores, Casablanca, Tripoli, Cairo, Jerusalem, Abadan, Kurachl, Delhi, Agram. Calcutta. Rangoon, Chabua, Kunming. Chung­king, Nanning, Cheklang, Slan, Tungwan. Chengtu. and now we're on our way to Ceylon, after which we'll visit more of India, and go Into Italy, where I hope to be able to get an audience with His Holiness. I've been able to meet and talk with such people as the Generalissimo, Generals TVedemeyer, Wheeler, Davidson, Chennault. Lord Louis Mountbatten. It's been probably the most unusual trip ever arranged by the "War Department, with • me being fortunate enough to represent CBS. It's no fun being separated from the family at home, however, and I pm glad we are now on our way back."

Bc»b Kirby came through with one of his masterpieces which I give you as follows: 
"In March, I had a V-mall from Eddie Bafter, who at that time was parley vooing and preparing for a 30-day temporarj' assign­ment in the States. In three years overseas, the only N. D. man he had met was Phil O'Coanor, who had slightly silvered on the noggin—otherwise the same as ever. I Imagine Eddie's back home now, so he can give you all his dope direct. 
••Prom the Mystik Adhesive Products in Chicago, came a swell note from Bob Sigtkty —submitting the envious fact that the score was even in the Rigney league—2 boys and two girls. I think I'll get mrrried and settle down. 

**Gene Farrell, now news editor of the 'Newark Star-Ledger/ sent a swell letter. He compli­mented the class of 1928 on producing a crepehanger and a good newspaper man. He reveals the astounding fact that after he left 
N. D. he got married and got a Job. He says he's still married and still has a Job— also three boys, 
"And then, that busy litle bee. Jack Win-S«rt«r, took time out to drop me a line—and he had the effrontery to inquire about the size of the Kirby family. He should know that the number might change between the time I mail the answer to that question and the time he receives It. I have formed an inviolable rule to never answer that question by mail. 
"Forgot—Gene mentioned that through the years he has gathered fragmentary evidence of the existence of Ed Tally. Bcmie Bird and I^ank Omnors/*—but "never a word about Cliff Trombley, Walter Hugh layne, Dick Weppner, etc." 
"I got a great kick out of reading about Iroe in the latest 'Alumnus*—imagine that old goat worrying about that big bird flapping it's wings around his chimney—won't he ever grow up?"

Jadse Callagy has been seen quite often of late at our meetings, and, though changed very little in appearance, he now has that dignified look of a well fed Domestic Relations Oflicer. 
"lianry CnlUney left these parts for his home town of Rutland, Vt., where. I under­stand, he is now running the local bank. Culiiney has a verj* charming and pretty wife. 
"Tom litxwan evened things up with Vermont by coming to Long Island where I understand he is connected with the Philips Company, on construction engineering projects. He has threatened to travel the 15 or 20 miles into the Big City to visit us but to date—no Tom. 
"Ran into Bill Cronin a couple of weeks ago when he was desperately looking for a house big enough to handle that mob of his—and he was quite discouraged. However, I gather that he has located a place somewhere in Westchester and w^iil be up this way per­manently soon. 
**Bod Harley, ex. '28, is running a very successful bistro in Albany—not far from the railroad station and he has quite a few Notre Dame boys dropping in on him from time to time John Antns is quite a regular attender at our meetings and has a very much alive and kicking legal practice. 
"Does any one ever hear from Bill Daffyt who, at last reports, was practicing law in Washington, D. C, or does ^any one ever hear from John Paul Courts, ex. *2S, Duffy's old roommate and townsman from Watertown, New York ? 
"As former club members and classmates we read with interest about John Hinkel's activities in Italy. 
"The local club board asked me to repre­sent the N. T. Club officially at Bishop Ollara's installation at Buffalo, which I can assure you I was most happy to do. It was as touching and magnificent a spectacle as I ever witnessed in my life and I almost cried with joy to see our now world famous 'Pope* installed as a bishop—and I think that only 15 years ago (or so) he was our Father Confessor, and Father in all other ways. 
"Following the installation I had the pleasure of joining the Buffalo boys for lunch­eon. Father O'Donnell was there too and took time out of a busy day to spend some time with us. I had a very hard time break­ing away from Bill Dowdall and Gm Jenkiwu 
"Anyhow i did get back and have gotten around again to supervising special involving supply problems for the Pan American World Airwaj-s System. I spent a year (with my family) in Miami on one projiect and while there ran into Tom Mahon who is a full lieu­tenant in the Navj*. He is stationed at Richmond Naval Base, Florida.

1937 Frank J. Reilly, MacNair-Dor­'* " Und Co.. 254 W. 31it St.. New York City 
From Frank ReilLv: 
There -was a letter from Capt. James I* Gagnier, '37, who is (or was) stationed at Headquarters, tJSDTAF, St. Germaine-en-Laye, France. Jim said nothing about himself. m<»cle a few complimentarj* remarks about the column and enclosed a letter for Bob (Fr. Crnnan) Kelly^, O.F.M., who, Jim had read, was located just down the street from my office. It was the letter to Bob Kelly that carried the his news. Jim said he was being married on June 16, to a French lass from just outside St. Germaine-en-Laye. I think I speak for all Jim's friends when I say con­gratulations and I hope everytliing went off all right. Unless my scant notes, made about two months ago, belie me, Jim said he had studied law prior to his induction in July, 1941. In December, 1943, he went to Gngland and shortly thereafter to France. He said he had met many N. D. men, but not from our class. Jim celebrated V-E Day in Paris. 

Next in the order of news was a very help­ful letter from my very old pal, Joe Qoinn, of Newton, N. J. Joe wrote May 29, from Hamilton Hall A-23. Boston G3. A Harvard man, I believe. Joe writes: "I was com­missioned an ensign In supply at 90 Cliurch St., New York, on January 6. (1945). Had a week off and came liere for school to learn the Navy's way of handling funds. Expect to fini&h at the end of June and be on my way out to see the Nips. I've heard from Eddie Reardon, who was chasing the Krauts tlirough the fatherland. . . . He's a Quarter­master lieutenant. Gonlon Mnrphy, my old roomie, is a captain in the Quartermaster Corps, at Leghorn. Italy. I saw him a lot last summer when our destroyer was in Naples, Murpliy looked good, fatter and balder—missed the good old State of "Wyoming—as you can imagine. 
"Walt Nienaber reported from the Philippines the other day. . . . Walt was here at Com­munications School with •Bncky* Jordan. I saw a lot of them in ^larch, 1944,, up here with their families. Jim Dapners is here now, too. He's a Michigan boy, married and has one son, all signed for N. D., he says. I'm still singl e. Jerry Claej-is is at Klameth Falls, 
• Ore. He has a son, too." 
See what I mean wlien I said Joe sent me a helpful letter? How about some of you other fellows like Vince Hartnett, Johnny SlcCarthy, from out Denver way, or Jack Hurley, coming through in similar style ? 
The third letter I received since the last piece I wrote for the 'Alumnus' came from another New Jersey boy making good with the Navy. That would be Bill Sharp, late of Summit, more recently of New York and currently somewhere in the Pacific. Bill wrote on June 17. . . . ''I've been In the Navy since February. '41, on various types of ships. I was last back in the States when I returned from Italy on an Army Hospital ship and hit the States at Charlestown. S, C. where I was treated at the U. S. Navy hospital there. Following that, I was assigned as skipper on this supply ship. It is quite a job. Don't see many N. D. men, however. Pass the word around—maybe there are some in the vicinity and we can have a reunion. 
"In November. 1942. I married a New York girl, with the able assistance of Bishop O'Hara and his staff, notably your brother. Bill, '34. Father Harry Stejnnan, C.S.C., married us in St. Patrick's Cathedral and your brother assisted at Mass. . . . Saw B:tb Gelires, '37, while in Naples. He was on Ills way home. Certainly sorry to hear about the death of IVank Haisking, *37. (A sentiment almost universally expressed by members of tlie class of '37 whom I've met or heard from.) Also over in the Mediterranean. I saw Frank McCarthy, 'Z7." 
Now. for some hearsay and first hand re­ports of '37 lads. Jerrj- Gillespie, whom I mentioned ia the June 'Alumnus.* dropped in again after I'd knocked out my stint for that issue and told me of having seen Pete Cassone, who was a pre-med student in our class. Pete is now in the Navy, a full lieu­tenant. I believe Jerry said. Jerry saw him at 90 Church St.. not long before. Pete is an it. D., and was wounded in action on Leyte, Jerry reported. He also mentioned rather significantly that Pete had seen quite a lot of action. In fact, I recill he told me that Pete was still carting around a fairly good sized piece of shell metal in some part of his anatomy and that he refused to have it removed. 
At the last meeting of the New York Notre Dame Club, "Will Kirk, Paul Shecdy, Tom Hutches, Bemie Relit}- pnd. I'm told. Ken Morlarity and Bill Wilson were on hand. I was attending another meeting that same night and had to come late and thus missed seeing Ken Moriarity. I did see Bernie ReiUy —for the first time since 1937—and got a fairly good idea of what he's been doing with him­self in the past eight years. Bernie told me he was, at that time, a first class electrician working on radar installations at Todd Ship­yard in Hoboken. N. J. He has been with Todd for the past two years. Before that, he sold Chevrolets for one of the larger New York automobile agencies and. for a sliort time after Pearl Harbor interrupted large scale civilian automobile production, was in real estate. 
Joe Schilling, now a senior grade lieutenant in the Navy, was in New York, in May, and had lunch with his old sidekick, Tom Haffbcs. Paul Sheecly told me at the meeting that John OXearj-, formerly of Chicago, was now with the F.B.I, in New York. I called John the following day and am still waiting to Iiave lunch with him as soon as he can get free. I did learn, via the phone, from John that he is living around the corner from Paul Sheedy in Jackson Heights, Long Island. John is married and has two children, both boys, I think he said. He's married to the sister of the late Dick Carroll, '37, who met with such a tragic death as a prisoner of war aboard an Italian submarine that was sunk. John says he has heard nothing about or from his old roommate. Res Morrison, of Rochester, N. Y. 
Jotmny McCarthy, of the Denver clan. Is rather busily engaged in the plumbing supply business, according to a young Notre Dame co-ed from St. Mary's, whom I met recently. John is doing very well, is married and has children, whose number I do not clearly re­call. Please clarify the point, John, along with a number of others. 
Art ShauKhnessy's dad told me the other day that Art recently was back In the coun­try for a week at Norfolk, Va., following a series of trips that have taken him clear around the world. Art is a yeoman, third class, and Is on a vessel tliat has done a number of repatriation jobs recently. Art was appointed to his captain's staff not long ago, which is in the nature of a promotion, although his rank remains unchanged ' until there is an opening in the rank above. In­cidentally, Art's cousin, not a Notre Dame man. is John MacDonald. the ace United Press correspondent who has been covering the war in Europe. 
Speaking of relatives. I met Will Kirk's brother, a Franciscan Father, who is stationed in the same monastery as our classmate Bob (Cronan) Kelly. Fr. Cassian Kirk, like brother "Will, is in the patois, a "right Joe." 
Joe MucDonald, of the class of '36. a busi­ness neighbor of mine here in New York, and assistant to the vice-president of his firm. Standard Garment Co., phoned shortly after the appearance of the next to last issue of the 'Alumnus* to renew an acquaintance that began in 1933 in a French class we were taking under Prof. Benjamin DuBois.' Joe had been living with his wife and three children In Englewood, N. J., until someone bought the house they were living in and forced the MacDonalds out. Joe still Ives In Englewood, while his family is living with his wife's people in Ware, Slass., to which Joe com­mutes week-ends. Joe and I had lunch last week and got pretty well caught up on each other's doings for the past nine years. 
The parting shot: Coming down 31st St. to the office one morning this week I met Foul Sheedy rushing around getting his car parked in a nearby lot and hurrying across the street to Pennsylvania Station. Paul just about had time to say "hello and goodbye. I've got to meet a train." Incidentally, my office Is located across 31st St. from Penn Station and is the only office building on the block between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, so if any of you fellows coming through that way could take a few minutes off, I'd like to have you come up to the office and say hello. How­ever, If you can't do that, you can certainly write me a letter and tell me what you're doing!

From Hal Williams: 
Top spot for this issue goes to Capt. Bob Mazanee who wrote the following on a German typewriter from somewhere In Germany: "I have just completed my first hitch in the Army; In my service I covered the east, northeast, southeast, south, southwest and middle west. Finally they shipped me out last August. We hit England, then France, and. in October, we got in the Metz campaign and subse­quently the Saar fight. We have done a lot of traveling over here, serving in the U. S. Third Army, the British Second, aird the U. S. Ninth Army. Now I'll try to remember some of the boys I have seen: 
*'Art Davldsvn turned up at Camp Polk. La., that was in September, *43. Then I met Charley Boiler in Los Angeles. I understand that Ja«^ IiWidcren was with a division out there In the desert that winter, but I never did get to see him. At Hershey, Pa.. I saw FkBnk Baibasli and hfa wife. I also met Bill Terry, In Pennsylvania. Fom there I went to Taunton, Mass., and met CUc Galtecber at the dog races one evening. When we got to England we picked up our civil affairs man. Lt. Col. llMnuis Y. Holland, and he turned out to be one of the Kansas City boys from back in '17 or thereabouts. 
"On niy way up to the front I ran Into Mike Crowe In Le Mans, and at that point I ceased seeing any of the boys although there are many of them nearby. .. . I have a sneaking suspicion that John R. Kelley is In my immediate vicinity but I have not had an opportunity to look him up. At 'present I am writing for his address from my wife so I can contact him. Say hello to Al Boiler with American Airlines In Washington. D. C. . . . Chariie Daly at Merced Air Base In California. . . . Don Hicfcey. . . .Oh yes. my kid brother Is an ensign, operating out of New Caledonia. ... " 
Thanks, Bob, for a swell and newsy letter. I'll send Kelley your address. 
And now a grand letter from Johnny Beer who writes from the Philippines— "After a few hectic, sleepless and nerve-wracking days and nights up on the lines, I can think of no better way to relax than to read through the 'Alumnus.* The October issue arrived Just a few days ago and 1 read It from cover to 
• The Notre Dame Alumnus 
cover. . . . My 31 months overseas are note­worthy from only one point of view—I've met oniy one X. D. ilan. . . Lt. Jock Clifford^ '41, of the Marine Corps, and, coincidentally, a native of my home town of Auburn, X. T. Met Jack on Guadalcanal in October '43, and haven't seen or heard from him since. . , . My daughter, Carol Ann, just rounded tlie two-year mark. Her latest achievement is learning to pray, but I don't even believe children's prayers, as powerful as any, can speed up the rotation policy and get daddy home- Would like to hear from Crowley, Bohm,' Baa«r» and. as a matter of fact, any of the old gang." 
Charlie **Bod" Kulp, Jr., says: "The latest issue of the 'Alumnus' just arrived. News of '3S is scant so here's my contribution: I recently heard from Charlie ilorrow, Lt. (jg) USXR, who is the executive officer of an LST. currently operating in the Pacific area. He has seen plenty of action in the BTO, having been in the assault phase in both Normandy and Southern France. I saw 1st Lt. Phil Bayer several months ago. He is now stationed at Camp Pinedale, Fresno, Calif-, as a signal corps radar oflScer. He's expecting to be shipped out soon. The only other '3S man I have news about AfoJ. Hug^h Correll of the AAF. Last I heard, which was months ago, he was returning to Europe. As for myself —I am a Lt. (jg) In the Supply Corps and am attached to the ... . (attack transport) as disbursing and assistant supply officer (thanks to N'. D.'s BSC). To date we have taken a minor part in the Philippine cam­paign and were in the assault phase on "L" day at Okinawa." 
Thanks, "Bad" for a swell letter. Write again. 
And now—for the first time—Bob Deren­iro<iki. He writes, "I'm in the Philippines with the army and while things were rough for a time I'm well-situated now. That last is somewhat of an overstatement—the mud is up to my knees right now. Since graduation I've acquired a wife and two children, a boy and a girl. I haven't encountered any of the class since '43 when I ran into Joe Xigro, a second lieutenant In the CAC. I have seen some of the real old timers, however, ancients from the classes of *31 and '32. . . . The arrival of the 'Alumnus' was like a breath of fresh air in the stench and heat of the tropics. I'll ne\*er, regard the magazine casually again." 
Nice going. Bob. Now let's hear from you again; and not In six years. 
Then there Is the swell V-letter from a good friend Ed Bartnett. He tells about his experiences In Hurope and then passes along some information on Bill Wocmer. Writes Ed, "Bill had to give up pilot training In '42 be­cause of an infected foot, but finally got to a limited OCS- He was assigned administra­tive work at Fort Knox and got to be a first lieutenant. But he still hankered to fly, and finally was readmitted to pilot train­ing. He won his wings as a flying fortress pilot and was awaiting a plane at the time he wrote. His address is: Lt. William J, Woerner, Squadron A. Lincoln Army Air Bise, Lincoln, Neb." Ed evidently has seen quite a bit of action as he now wears three battle stars. He ended his letter by saying that he believed he was to be transferred to Public Relations In Paris. He evidently got the job because I got a new address two weeks later. 
And then there is the letter from my old roommate, E, A. **Bod*' Sherwood. 
Sherwood, an ensign In the Navy, is now stationed on Long Island, after studying at Harvard and William and Marj-. He expects to be shipped out soon and writes, "My orders read that I am to have charge of the Fleet Officers Recreational Facilities which, r.s far as I can establish. Is only a long bar. I have 13 enlisted personnel to help operate It!" Bud also mentions that he spent several weekends with Mr. and Mrs. Caz Vance (Iran Ivancevic) 'and Pat StlUisano and his wife. Pat Is a first lieutenant and has just been returned to the States after 34 months in the South Pacific. Continues SherAVood, "Before we left 
Boston Lt. George Htzpatrick got in touch with me and we went out to their place several times. He also had me aboard his ship for dinner. He is the executive officer on a converted yacht which does patrol work out of the Boston harbor." Oh yes, Sherwood also mentioned that he and his wife stopped in Taunton, Mass., to see Jaek Cleaty's folks and wife. 
The Navy should know what It Is doing. but. personally, I think they made a mistake when they put Sherwood in charge of the bar for the fleet. 
Address: Ens, Emory A. Sherwood, SC, USN'R, A B A T U, NTC Lido Beach, Long Island, N. T. 
And that's all except an announcement that Edward T. Tighe has become associated for the general practice of law with the firm of Meleney, Ryan and Stevenson, Graybar Build­ing, 420 Lexington Ave., New York, 17, N. Y. 
Nice going, fellows, and keep those letters flowing. I enjoy the work of forwarding them to ARMSTRONG and DOOLEY, Ltd. 
Ed BaHnett, in his V-Mall writes that ". . . .In the 15 months I've been in the ETO I've literally met dozens of Notre Dame men. Unfortunatelj'. I can't recall the names of any but a few of them. First of all, there was Capt. Bill Toaine>* whom I met in England and again in Paris. - The others were Hemy Rago, who was an instructor in English at N, D., and Bill Syrinr, '41, both of whom are in CIC like me There are a great many Notre Dame men in CIC, but I'm not sure just which of them are over this way,"

From lit. Jack Hayes on June 28 to Lt. Jack Patterson (the latter athletic oflficer of the First Infantry Division in Germany): 
"Just a few lines to say hello. For the last couple of years your news of the fellows has been as welcome to my eyes as a familiar face. This being my first letter since leaving school. I hardly know where to begin. As Elmer l4fcyden used to say in the spring. 'We'll start with the fundamentals; so settle back, lad. A certain amount of this dope will be outdated but here it is, ready or not. 
"Upon graduation I spent a very enjoyable and enlightening six months coaching at Rock­hurst College, Kansas City, Mo. I had a good bunch of boys and a fair amount of success, with Tommy Callahan, ex. *43, playing a whale of a game at end for me. I enlisted in the Navy as a chief, attached to Gene Tunney's athletic branch in January, *42. Re­ported for active duty Norfolk, Va., In March, and kept In step, for a few months with Don Elser, >'ick Lnkets, and Frankie Gaul, all In the same program. Nick and I transferred to Newport, R. I, In May, and I spent the next eight months making Navy recruits as uncomfortable as possible with dally calis­thenics, etc. While there I also clocked Chuck McNeill, '42. as he took 'the hurdles In ofiicers* indoctrination school. 
"I transferred to gunnery in December, '42, and spent the next seven months In the Aleu­tians' aboard a destroyer escort, on which Walt O'Brien (around '36) was gunnery offi­cer. Received a commission In September, '43, and was sent to Tucson, Ariz., for officer in­doctrination, where I met Jerry Donovan, '40, undergoing the same treatment.

"I was transferred to Ft. Schuyler, N. T., in November, but took enough time enroute to get marled in Kansas City, and catch the 
N. D.-Iowa Pre-Flight Game in South Bend. I don't think it advisable at this time to delve into either one of these events. At Ft. Schuyler I indoctrined with Larry Bums, DJO Ckissitly, GeoFKe Fazzi, '41. and Tom Rcardon, '39.

"Raymond J. Ill, was born February 1. 1943, at the Portsmouth >'aval Hospital, Francis Spencer was bom Augrust 16, 1944 at the Xorfollv Naval Hospital. I don't believe the latter event was ever mentioned in the 'Altini­nus' and the fault is all mine. .. . A medical ­survey board sent me out to these western reaches and I have settled for the time at the University of New Mexico as a seaman­ship instructor in the NROTC unit with the impressive title of assistant professor of naval science and tactics. It seemed strange to be on the other side of the desk. The work is intoresting and I like it a lot. 
"Since arriving: in Albuquerque, I've run into several N. D. grads. . "WTien I first arrived I went to the disbursing- office to turn in the necessary- copies of my orders to start draw­ing my pay and found the disbursing- officer was Lt. (ig) Hosinski, a "WAVE. Her husband was in the office when I got there and. to my amazement, was 1st t,t* Bill Hnsiaski, '41. Bill was on sick leave at the tinie and we had a great time talking over 'the good, old days* in South Bend. Shortly afterwards. Bill's leave was up and he returned to San Antonio and Ifartha was transferred to Xew­port. K. I. I have heard since that she has been discharged from the "WAVES and is with Bill in Texas.

From Scoop Scanlun: 
The opening V-Mail comes from I*t. Ed Baeoffer, somewhere In Germany, dated S May 1945: 
"In the last month or two, I have seen quite a large share of this country over here and also almost every type of combat from difitcult street fighting in towers to ordinary screening operations over a pastoral country­side. Today I listened to Mr, Churchill an­nounce to the world the long-awaited V-E Day, Over here that bit of news did not come as much of a surprise as we were able to observe the conditions that existed and so could see the end approaching. However, des­spite our lack of celebration, I dare say that we are as grateful as anyone for this com­plete and final victory and can now only pray that the peace that we will establish will be a lasting^ and just one. 
"In the last few weeks I have seen 6.500 German prisoners assembling- at one collecting point at one time, watched starved Russians recently liberated eating food from a gutter, witnessed the uncontrolled joy of Allied PW s when they knew they were again free men, and to top the highlight of events I have even observed German children wave joyfully at passing American troops under the approv­ing eyes of their parents."

Chief Specialist Steve Joxwilc, has been trans­ferred from the "V-12. unit at Northwestern University, where he was stationed for a year and a half, to a new assignment at San Francisco. 
Just too late for the June issue of the 'Alum­nus' was a swell air-mail letter from Prt, Tom Ronrke, dated 12 May and sent from India, with pictures enclosed: 
"I've been planning a letter to you for almost three years but it just never seemed to get on paper. After leaving N. D. on May 10, 1942, I went to work for Bell Aircraft In Buffalo, along with Hoelscber, Buko^ Morre and Shiek, Inc. From there to Chance Vought In Stratford, Conn., where I dldled In the aero­drenamics department. Met Bforio (Pete) Pot­tetti of our class and Jim Kelly, '40. 
"In one of my Jaunts for OVA, I ran Into Bob DeM«tss at Cedar Point XAS (he was an ensign then), and entered the Army April 10. 1944. The day before, I had been present at Joe Borick's wedding on I*. I. Also present were John Gilbert and Tom Beilly. Haven't heard from any of these lads since except Joe. Got a card from him recently announcing the arrival of Joe, Jr. » 
"My stay In the States as a soldier was short—five months. On the way over, ran Into Bill Spanicler of the Law School. Shortly after arriving In India, I had a letter from Bob ¥inneran who apparently, at the time he wrote, was stationed in India also. He's a flight engineer on a B-29, Haven't been able to contact him for a get together since. I Bob was later killed In the Pacific. See war deaths this issue—Eds.l Please disregard all reports you have previously had about India and Its mystic and magic, etc. It isn't what I ex­pected from reading the travel folders." 
Tlie picture of Tom, carried this note on the back: "This Is me—with a high priest of the Taj Mahal. He consented to pose so long as I left him wear my spectacles. Then I had a heck of a time getting them back. Notice the shoeless feet—" 
On July 10, Flijcht Officer Jim Rice air­mailed a note from a San Francisco address, stating: Ruth [that's his recent bride], and I had a very enjoyable train ride back to Riverside. Calif., from 'Wisconsin. There we spent one very busy month before they decided to send me out to see the world. After leav­ing March Field, my crew moved fast and before one could take three deep breaths, we were over the Pacific." 
In mid-July, I had the pleasant surprise of a visit at Fort Sheridan from I.t. Jack Tollett. Jack rotated home from 15th Air Force duties in Italy—looked mighty fine and none the worse for the hair-rasing experiences he had when he paracliuted from a plane which was battered up in a bombing mission over Vienna. Luckily; some of Marshal Tito's Yugoslav forces rescued him and eventually got him back to safety. "While In Italy. Jack ran into Bill Early for a few moments one day. 
On July 10, Mr. "Alumnus" himself. Bill Dooley, came out to learn the lay of the land about Army counseling services from Major Harold Dunn, at the Separation Center. Bill, accompanied by Ed O'Toole, '25, director of the Chicago N. D. club's vocational program for veterans, discussed and examined ways and means of helping returning Notre Dame men regain their place in civilian life. They also had quite a visit with Sgt, Geori^ Costello, '40, and just missed seeing Bill Walsh, counseling library expert and editor of a daily news summarj* of counseling developments. Bill was Iiomc In Rockford on a three-day pass. 
"Walsh sent up a couple notes the other day: 
••Bill Cook, a former N. D. track star. Is a vocational counselor at Percy Jones Hospital In Battle Creek. Mich., Bill was with us here 
Pvt Tom Rourke, '42« at the Taj MahoL (See '42 news, this issue)

"Also of interest might be the happenings to Jnck Hitchcox, class of '37, a lieutenant (j.g-) on an LST in the Okinawa area. Jack was awarded the Bronze Star recently for heroism. He Is a Rockford boy, a former deputy in the bureau of internal revenue be­fore receiving his commission." 
Xow it's time to glance into the doings of the lawyers and Mrs. Lora Lashbrook con­tributes this newsy communique: 
First of all, we had an announcement of the birth of a daughter to Capt. and Mrs. John Venlunk on June 25 at their home in South Haven, Mich. This makes two for John, the first-born, a son, having reached his second birthday or nearly so. 
Several of the boys home from the European war or enroute from the European theatre to the •pacific area have stopped In for a short visit. Among them were: JJt, (J.gr.) James F. McVay, Lt. (J.tr.) Joe 3Iiller.. Lt. Jerry 0*Dowd, and iLt. Jack Tallett. Jack believed he might be kept in the States for a while at least, but the others have gone back to duty with the fleet. Lt.

Having become bored with that type of duty he transferred to the Pacific Fleet-
A long and Interesting letter arrived from Bill Spongier, still stationed In India. He re­ported that on June 5 their Notre Dame Club held Its first meeting at St. Gregory's School in a village near his station. They enjoyed a delicious dinner consisting of dishes he refuses to tr>* to identify. They had a lengthy discussion centered about activities under the Golden Dome, all the way from Bishop Crow­ley's class of 1902 to John Nolan's class of 1945. The outstanding feature was a talk by Bishop Crowley and It was enjoyed by: Fathers Christopher Brooks, '12, Faol Shea, '27, James SfcGarvey, '28, Joseph Toorfev '29, 
Brother Jade, and Brother Bfotthew, '33 and '36, respectively, William Boms, '40, Jamen Price, *43, John Nolan, '45, and Bill himself. '43. They had as guests and later made them honorary members: lather Joseph Perrimattam of South India, and Father Joseph Gesafti of the province in which the boys are stationed. Other Notre Dame men In the area who were kept away by lack of transportation were Charles Kelly '39, Joseph McGovem, '35. I<eo

On June 19. Ji ^ Diver wrote one of his very-rare letters from Europe but said that they were In the midst of preparations for the home­ward journey and were then in France, but expected to be home before a letter could be sent back. So far we have looked for him in vain but still hope he will find time to come in for a visit before he is sent to the Pacific. He had heard from John Meyer before he left Germany. He reported that he got the 'Alum­nus' through the generosity of Chmplain Murwt^, 
A nice, long letter from 14. Tim Greca stationed In the Philippines reporting- that at that time he was stationed In comfortable quarters furnished with electricity, and an ice box large enough to' cool a generous supply of beer. His work has to do with Army per­sonnel in that area, principally with awards, promotions, etc He reports a number of Notre Dame men In that area, including: PUl lUwrly, '32, Tom Cannon, *35, Don Comora, '42.

Ramey Grainey, on the staff of the Paris edition of "Stars and Stripes" has failed to reply to a letter full of questions sent him some weeks ago. Either his editorial duties are keeping him too busy or he is to come home. 
Among the soldiers returned for a thirty-day leave before headlng^ for the Pacific is Nick Villarosa, who got over Just in time for the end of the war in Europe,

Ferguson, ex, M3, was in Detroit on June 29 to attend a party announcing his engagement to Miss Sally Hickey, Ed's sister, and then returned to Glenview. 111. Ed Hickey missed the party but is expected home In a couple of months. Last heard from, he was holding a three-man reunion with N. D. Detroit­ers Johnny Anhut and J. J. Gorman at Cavlte. 
Hickey's roommate. Bill Brady, is in a navy radar unit on a ship In the Paclfia Fanl Malloy is engaged 'tis said. Matt SolUTan finished Georgetown this June with a medical degree and a na\-y commission. Chariie McKeh-y was a prisoner of war in Germany for IS months and is now home In Kansas City. And Ted Zitnik, ex. '43, is spending 30 days leave in Chicago after spending IS months as a prisoner. He traveled around the country visiting the families of the other members of his crew before receiving his leave. Jim Byrne is at present an Asdevlant instructor somewhere in Florida, close to Fort Lauder­dale, 
Now on to the letters. The first Is from a long-lost Marine named Morrill. Bob says, "In a "back issue of the 'Alumnus' under class news I noticed that Tom Moloney made men­tion of our group. He referred to me as 'Tom ilorrill.' so I would appreciate your sending me his address in order that i may straighten him out. Then too. I might be able to drag some of his Interesting views on the Jersey City political picture out of him, 
"At present I am stationed 'somewhere on Guam* and have been for some time. The Island of Guam Is often refered to as the 'Times Square' of the Pacific, so there should be a good number of our class passing through here from time to time. Up to present, though, I have seen none. 
"Ed McKim is buried not far from -our camp, so I was able to attend the MemorJal Day services. Tou will recall he gave his life in the recapture of this island. Heard from Ed's wife, Frances, just recently and she says their son looks a good bit like Ed. 
"As a source of N. D. and class news. In addition to my copies of the 'Alumnus,' I have received some very nice letters from Ed Smith of the College of Commerce. 
"Heard from Bbiir McGowan prior to the German surrender and it seems as though he was way ahead of everyone else in his thinking.. At that early date he was 'sweating out' the possibility of his redeployment out. here. Just yesterday Blair mentioned In his letter that he expects to be home from ETO shortly for 30 days before coming out here. He seems to be quite sure that he will rate the trip out here somehow." 
Thanks a lot for writing. Bob. Blalr has forgotten in three letters to include your address as requested. Now I'll write. Tom was not to blame for misnaming you. It was either my typing or the typesetter. And I hear that Blair's division has been assigned to" the occupation forces. I hope you said a prayer on behalf of the class at Ed's grave on Memorial Day. 
The next letter comes from Lt. <jff) I>ed Gore* now in the States for a spell. Fred says, "Boy, what a pleasure to write that Stateside heading. Jo© Callahan and this homesick guy, having spent over 23 months over the horizon, are indeed glad to get back. 
"... -ieft England on the 14th of June ... . finally arived In Norfolk. "What a re­ception we got—there wasn't a single soul on the dock to greet us, not even one sailor to handle the lines. . . . The Irishman and my­self are hoping for some solid shore duty, but things loo'k pretty black at the moment. It seenis one just has to have 24 months of continuous sea duty and we have but twenty-three and one-half. . . . Gail Htch, Tom Cooney, McElroy, and the rest returned ahead of us By the' way, where are all the boys who were up at Dartmouth with us? .. . . Harry McKnlght dropped on board today. 
"Joe and I are looking fonvard of course to that long awaited 30-day leave. . . . both of us hope to get out to N. D. I'll have to go to .Chi, ansTvay, to see a few of my brotliers. Just before we left England my kid brother Ted flew down to Plymouth and was aboard the last two days. Brother George, ex. '45, is still recuperating from wounds received in France. Brother Joe, ex. '42, la managing the hotel in Fort Lauderdale after being dis­charged. My wife was supposed to leave for the States two days before me, but the Na\T cancelled all transportation for dependents, so now it's not known when she will get over. I'm hoping before I shove off for the Pacific, though. At the present time she Is home In Scotland with her folks." 
I, too, would like to hear from some of the Dartmouth crowd. I Jieard from Jim Girard a month or so ago and he was just starting home from about ten miles from Tokyo It seemed. His letter is among the stuff I shipped home but hasn't arrived. Quince Sturm was still in South Pacific about five months ago. And the others I haven't heard from. 
The third letter is one of those a guy with the job one dreams about but seldom receives. It's from Gene Fehlig, now a lieutenant (jg), 
"At present, I'm here in "Washington, D. C, on duty in the Bureau of Ordnance (shipment scheduling section). It's been the first real duty I've had since being discharged from medical treatment. Feels good, too, as six months and a day in the hospital certainly made a loafer out of me—as if that altered the normal course of things. Teah. I've got a wicked grip on that old pencil and am pushing it to beat all hell. 
"Here's what news items I could gather: Received a letter from Jack (KMalley just a week ago. Jack and I had been together from our freshman year up until the days preceed­ing the Normandy invasion and both were en­gaged in- shore fire control work. I was wounded; he, taken prisoner by the Jerries. On May 2, 1945. he was liberated by the British 2nd Army. I sincerely hope that he'll read this and drop you a line concerning his 'stay' with Hitler's buddies. He's got a real story to tell. I was plenty glad to hear that he's back in the States, now living in Cincin­nati on a 60-day leave. 
"While on my way to 'chow* about three weeks ago I ran Into Lt. Joe Petrlti. He certainly looks good and. believe It or not, can now cast a show with any of them. The Na\-y chow must agree with him, as it does with me. 
"News about Bill Johnwn (Preeport) and his being awarded an MGM contract certainly hit the spot with me. . . . Was in hopes that I would have heard from Lt. (Jc) Ollie Hunter by now. We've corresponded fairly regularly up to the present; but OlUe's now on the . . . PPO, San Francisco. Undoubtedly he's had little opportunity to write to any one. 

"Lt. <jv> Joe Ginnaiw is stationed here in Washington. He's at the Army-Navy staff college, new War Department Building. Jick (wife) and I try to get him out to our place from time to time. 
"A letter from lit. (Jg) Ftank Conforti finds him recently recuperating from a leave in the States after duty aboard the ... . He's 'Exec/ engineering officer, and first lieutenant all rolled into one. *'Lt. Uff) Tinc« Slatt is an ofllcer in charge of machinery Installation at the Charleston Navy Yard, Boston. He's work­ing on the subs. Guess he knows his 'onions' all right from what I could gather from the co-workers when I visited him recently. He's up for congratulations, too. His wife, Peg, recently, gave birth to a little one. 
"And speaking of N. D.'ers In Boston, I certainly ran into a bunch of them when I was attending the ammo handling school. For one. Jack Andnti, SKT 3/c, Is on duty there and the proud pappy of a little Andres, Stephen, born March 30. His address when last he wrote. Building 149-8 inventory. Navy Yard, Boston. 
"Saw Bill McCTanghey, another lieutenant (jg). Just in for a few days In Boston. Forget now which destroyer he's on. Read In the St. Mary's 'Courier.' (Jick being graduate from same) that JA, BUI O'Neil marries his date of many a Sunday afternoon—Posle. Bill had been stationed In Helena, Mont., where he visited my In-laws, 
"lit, (Jic) Tom M. Sweeney writes from the ... . FPO, San Francisco, that sometime In March he had seen Ed HIckey, Kevin OTooIe, Jeny CDowd, and others in an officers' club somewhere in the Pacific. Also he had seen Mark Fowler, Johnny Boyle. Frank King, Howie Hanks* and others. (Soy, sounds good to hear those names again, doesn't It? Just like being back at N. D. reading off the ab­sentee list after a week-end.) Guess Sweeney, like all of us, looks forward to reading about his personal buddies, and, after having had it tough along the way, takes a great deal of pride In looking up the friends of the enjoy­able years under the Golden Dome. 
"Jick and I have a little daughter, Kathy, who'll be just one year old come the 30th of this month, June. She's certainly a little red­headed 'devil-eyes' if there ever was one. 
"What do you hear from my old roommate, Don Miller? I feel like a heel for not writing him oftener but I do think he owed me a letter at present. At any rate, I haven't his address. I hope he's safe. 
"We'd bo tickled to death to see any of the fellows who might be In Washington or on their way through. I'd appreciate it If you post this address: Lt. (jg) E. A. Fehllg, USNR, Room 335, Section Ad7b, Bureau of Ordnance, Navy department. Just phone Republic 7400, extensions 5061, 4S17 or 62072. Our home ad­dress is 3310 Valley Drive, ParkFairfax, Alex­andria, Va. Telephone Temple 0383. That should be an indication that the 'latch' Is out to any of the gang who're looking for a few drinks, a meal, or a good ol' 'bull session.' Combine them all, If he likes." 
Well, that's a real letter. I'm sorry that I received It just after I arrived home as I spent three days in Washington early In July. Your letter was on it's way south then. Don >niler resigned his commission for fiight train­ing and is nearly completed with that some­where in the middle west. I can't thank you enough for the letter, Gene. It really saved the column as I haven't been able to gather much and didn't know Red Lonergan was too busy until I arrived home. I'm sure sorry I missed that drink and dinner in Washington too. Maybe later. 
That's about all for this issue. How about some more of you following in Gene's foot­steps and giving us a line on yourselves and those others you've seen or heard from. News is what keeps this column going. 
1944 P^^ ^''^ ^ Ljnth, USA 
• ^^ General Hospiul, Ward B-9, Camp Pickett^ Va. 
From John Lynch: 
Two more months have gone by since wo last got together, and I have some letters here that I know you'll want to read. But first let me report that my five months in this hospital have finally enabled me to get around and about. Last week i met Bob QaMaty, class of '46 and Syracuse, N. V., while hob­bling up the corridor. Bob was with the 25th Division in the Philippines before he was wounded. Two more N. D. men down here are Dave Dolrympler '34, and Bill Donarily* 
•39. Dave is with the reconditioning cadre and Bill writes for the camp paper, 'The Pickett News.' 
£arl Engleit wrote just a few days after the last deadline, so we'll give him some space right now. 
"After receiving my temporary appointment of second lieutenant last October at the AAF Tech Scliool at Yale I was assigned to the ATC. Friend and classmate 'Sorm. Haoser was sent to the Troop Carrier Command, and I haven't heard from him since. At Yale, it was a pleasure to spend Saturday nights and Sundays with such stalwarts as Fat Tokla­vitch. Brock Lsrnch, Jim Cooney, *43, and Owen Doyle, *45. All are In med school there. Pat owes me some mail ' Incidentally. Had a wonderful dinner one Sunday with his family, now living In New Haven. 
"Wintering In Long Beach, Calif., provided good opportunity to meet old friends either there or in Los Angeles. Among those I met were Dick Doermer, Frank Vignola, Barney Fyne, Neil HcMnnos, and several not In our class whom I can't remember. I met Dick at a Christmas dance at the Ambassador. The next morning going to Church I met Frank. His ship was at San Pedro for just a few days. Barney Pyne came Into my line office New Year's Day asking about the condition of his plane which was undergoing repairs. He is a shavetail In the AAF. Highlight of my stay in California was meeting Neil McManus, a fellow chem engineer at N. D. We had quite a time of it, including dinner aboard his slilp In San Pedro harbor. It was the night after that that I was rudely awakened and told to report to the Shipping Office. Next stop, Chanute Field, 111., for schooling. 
"While at Chanute I got over to see the campus. It was one of those typical early spring afternoons. On campus I met the _ parents, St. Mary's sister, and girl friend of Dom Boetto. They told me that Dom was still on an LST mother ship and had been at Iwo Jima. Brother Meinrad told me that 'Black John* Murphy had been wounded and was in a Richmond, Va., hospital. Have his address? 
"Leaving Chanute Field I headed for my new assignment at West Palm Beach. PI-». During my three days there I met Chvck Ffckhardt. We went swimming together and shot the bull for an afternoon. Then I was ordered to my present assignment here in Miami. 
"After ten months of 'eager-beaver* cadet training for maintenance engineering I spent six months working as an assistant engin­eering officer. Now I am ground safety officer at the Miami Army Air Field. Td appreciate it if you'd have any of the boys going through Army Redistribution Centers at Miami Beach or the Naval Training Center look me up. I can be contacted at the Ground Safety Office on the Field or by calling information at the Miami telephone exchange. 
"From the NTC I have met Ensigns BUI Scheoch and Mike 3Ialloy, Bill is still here but Mike has shipped out. Mike had his very lovely wife here with him. . They were married in St. Patrick's Church in MiamL 
"My mall bag Includes a letter from 14. nc d Kiclivn. He tells me that his Lgrons Hall roommate, J<Aa 'Starchj' Blabop, Naval Air Corps, was killed off Guadalcanal, -.bat I have seen no mention off it in the '*lmnniig/ Starchy'9 home was at Staten Island. Could you check on this report? Fred Is with the Signal Corps- at Ft. Monmontb. N. J. He also writes that: Tic CeHelti la on a wire-laying team In the ETC; B< Qrr is alab in the ETO; Tom Fwiait is working for my Seagram competition, Scbenley's; BOI (yCaa­aell Is with duPont's ButTalo plant; and ^ee Farrdl Is still working on a hush-hush project with a company In Tennessee. 
"Will yon or someone send me Kd Moae­lMa*s address. I have lost track of him as well as Mark De Mots and fkal CCeaBcil. I'd appreciate information on them. 
"I called Chack .Umlla'a famUy on the phone. Since being wounded on Capt. Bum­ett's USS California he has been' studying Japanese at the University of Colorade.^ Chtick still carries fragments in his .baclc -' 
"That about covers my end of the data news. From what my superiors told ine when ' I came here, I'll be at Miami Army Air Field for the duration plus. With the point system as announced I'll have a gray beard by the time I'm released from extended active; dn^." 
If all our readers would follow Earl's ex­ample, I think the class of *44 would be well accounted for. I know all of you haven't had his -luck in meeting former classmates, but let's hear from you anyway. Any news you may have is more than welcome. 
Earl's mention of **BIack JobaT Marpky had me.iltchlng to get across the swamp and the prairie to,-'Richmond and McGuIre General Hospital. But Murphy was ahead of me on that one and sent a swell letter from CudUng General Hospital in Framingham, Mass., where ha had recently been transferred. The date is May 24. 
"Brotiier Meiarad saw to it that I received a couple copies of the 'Alumnus,' as did JPaol Bynie, our University librarian. I see you are more or less incapacitated down at Pickett and are also conducting- our class column. I have a bit of news from all over, but wish it were up to date. Taas O'Coaaer, Ernie Sedlmayr, Bay CrComidl, and Mas KogtX3 1 hear are up in Austria with the Blue Devils. They sent some rare photos and Tom wrote to you, Jwk. Woclfle and DMc Milliman, when X was hospitalized in England for four months. I met £lnur MHIitaa while there. He broke his leg while horsing around before the first Holland glider-ride, and luck­ily missed out on the disastrotis deal. 
"I saw SCere OVuarke when he was a chaplain's assistant at Warminster. England, and later on I heard through his swell sister that he was killed in the Bulge Battle. Also saw Jack Tray and Bcberi Bofaa at that same place before the Normandy D-Day. 
"Baa. Ed BowU^ wrote from the PhUlp­plnes, and he is seeing plenty of stghtfl. Ha ran Into Bill O'Coaaor and many others-just as old Joe Gan did. Jtas Xloyd, my old roomie, married a Denver girl In January or February. His brother, Tom IJayd, class of '39. is flying a Navy patroUer In the Faclflc 'Red Jeba' Marphr Is flying against the Nips, too. May God watch over him. I met Jee Walsk of Arizona in Boston. He's at Harvard's medical school on the Army. He's married, too, and has a baby, 
"I've been searching all over for word from 106th vets on Bob McBride and Mike Ztnovicb.' Hope they are okay. Same goes for Jim lAagdrcB, naak Gaafek* Bad McKctry and others. Little B*Te Hlgcfeas went through basic with me at McCIellan -while you wera going the paces at Croft. The poor kid got It for keeps, as did Dea Carrie another N. D. boy in my basic company. Hah McAaUVc^ who was wltli naa k JBacBsk and Bob Banae In their battalion, is now with the' 310th General Hospital, headed over I hear. He's so stuck 
The Notre Dame Alumnus 
on microscopies he plans to tlirow three years of conimerce out for medicine after the war. 
"I was visiting my fiance-to-be in Phila­delphia, ivhen she was home before going- to France as a nurse, when word came of Charley IJCWTB' death. "What a shock! "Word on Fat Maschke Just about took ever>'thing out of me. 1*11 miss that swell guy. and the same for Dick Grant and Morrell Murphy," 
Murphy sent another letter June 21 saying that Mike ZuroTich was okay and with the 106th Division in Germany. And we know now that McBride and McKel^-j- were freed from German camps. 
Harry Lavery is another member of our class who is on the hospital circuit. Harry is in Vaughan General Hospital. Hines, 111. He was with the 90th Division in Normandy and was wounded shortly after D-Day near Utah Beach. He wrote early in June. 
"It's good to know that a few of tlie fellows are getting back; it's a continual surprise to me when I read that more and more won't. The latest was Jack JIcGinnis, I opened the Chicago "Tribune" the other day and there wa<i his picture, killed on Okinawa. Had a letter from Duke Lcarj's dad about a month ago. He had seen the latest 'Alum­nus,' too. Col. Learj- told me that Duke was a pfc in the 106th Division, and you must have heard what happened to them. Duke was in Stalag 4-B and, though I haven't heard any more, he must be liberated by now. EHe is—Eds.] 
"Have you heard where BUI Kenny or Joe Itud are? There are two guys that dropped from sight. Jim Kelley (of the managers) wrote me from the ISth Inf. of the Fighting First Division, and was still intact at the time. I hear from my old roomie, Dan Sterenfi* frequently. He seems to be in a Pacific taxi ser\*ice, hauling Marines to I wo, Guam. Tinian. Saipan, the Canal, etc Got his tail beat off too when they crossed the equator. Seems that Dan is working as hard as ever since he's one of the engineering officers on said attack transport." 
That's all we have from Harry, except that he was getting along pretty well on his once broken leg. I hope Uncle Sam gives him that discharge aoon. Harrj- is undecided about the postwar, but may go back to Notre Dame. Can't think of anything better myself. 
Mox Rogers, who was mentioned earlier in the column, comes in with a letter of his own. It holds a special interest for me because Mox, Ray O'Connell and I, sweated out quite a few days together in the 349th regiment of the SSth Division. 
"I'm sorrj-I didn't answer your letter sooner, but we were going like hell as you can well imagine, and I didn't even have time for many letters home. But the big thing is that It's 'finlto' now and this occupa­tion is really swell, especially since the odds aren't 6-5 any more. "We're in a hotel-—I have a private room—get B rations and plenty of free time with a minimum of work. The hours are good and we are in a swell spot; used to be the 'World's Playground.' This is heaven, but it won't last. I imagine you are figuring up your points, too. "Well, it looks verj* bad for most of us, as we all have about ^5. It'll be tough to go over to the other war, but it looks ineviti.ble. 
"Just saw Ray yesterday and he says to say hello and the best of luck on your leg. As for the rest of the people, they are all fine. Had a letter from Jack 3Iuran recently. He's in Germany with the 9th Army Engin­eers. I'll keep you posted on what they are doing with us and to us." 
One of the boys in my old squad wrote last week, and they were guarding a hos­pital full of Krauts in Meran, Italy, at the time. Mox and Ray are probably thereabouts, and it doesn't sound like heaven any longer. 
"Black John** Murphy, the same who sent that swell letter already quoted, came through a little later with three letters he had re­ceived from overseas. The first is from Ed Doniingr, ensign aboard an LCI In the Pacific A lot of the stuff is personal, so we'll have to pick the news in little bits. This was written ilay 25. 
"Well. I've been moving around quite a bit and we've been on quite a few operations. .. . I see the last time I wrote was some­time in Februarj-. Well, we didn't have any mail call for two and one-half months after that. And then I got over 100 letters and Tm still trying to catch up. During the past two weeks we've had the best set-up ever. We get mail almost every day—even if old mail—for just yesterday I got letters and cards of Christmas time. We also get fresh meat and movies now. 
"Got an invitation from Jim Lloyd to his wedding. Who's the gal? Must be an Air Force attraction. . . . Joe Summers writes pretty regularfj-. He's keeping me posted on all the news. Tou should read his descrip­tion of a St. Mar>-'s date. It's a riot. Seems that the seniors won't date any more be­cause there's no one old enough for them. His detailed account of a dance over there is really great. . . . How'd you like to be starting all over again at X. D. ? I'm afraid it would be an entirely different storj*—Gus's and Sweeney's would be packed, and McAoIUTe would have a tough time. . . . Had a V-mail from Bill 3IcNamara who's still in Hawaii sweating it out. I'm looking for many meet­ings of the clan in New York. . . . Have you heard from Jo© Gall? I wrote him a few months back, but never heard from him. . , . Haven't met any more N. D. boys lately, but they're around some place." 
From Czechoslovakia comes the second letter forwarded by Murphy. This is from Jim Kelley, the same mentioned above by Harrr Laiery. The date is May 2S. 
"Well. I managed to get past 'phase line one' okay. Xow all I have to contend with is tlie Pacific Bearing the stigma of a regular Army outfit, it goes without saying that we will stay in some kind of combat. I am ver>' short of points. 
"Right at the end they sent us down here to ferret the Huns out of these mountains, and much to our chagrin we found ourselves still shooting and being shot at while every­boily else on the continent had quit. But finally the end came even for us. 
"I heard that B«»b McBride was found alive in some jerry Stalag. I sure hope so." 
The last letter Slurphy sent is from Italy and Tom 0*<;onm>r. He is with SSth Divis­ion headquarters. 
"At present we're in Bolzano, Italy, about 30 miles south of Austria, smack in the moun­tains again. We're set up in a former Kraut headquarters, really a snappy joint. This place abounds in spirits; also the first place in Italy we can get beer. It's worse than 3,2, but with ice it doesn't taste bad. The Krauts had warehouses full of cognac, vodka, vermouth and what have you. Naturally the oflicers got the bigger share, and the best, but out of the goodness of their hearts, ble'ss them, they've allowed us to set up a com­pany bar. 
"Haven't seen Kelly, O'Connell or Borers. Their regiment is up in the Brenner Pass. Would like to see the lads." 
Now a little news from here, there and everj-where. Jen^- SkDfronick, was married June 2 in Washington. D. C. Pat Ward of that city is the Mrs. Shortly after, Jerry was tansferred to Ft. Monmouth. N. J. Kelly Cook, back from Italy and the 15th AAF, visited the campus June 30—with his bride. Jim Ciuminriiain, back from a shake-down cruise, was also around campus on his leave. And Jerry Coleman is &. civilian once again. Credit for the last few bits goes to Marguerite Varga, the secretary's secretarj* at the Alum­ni Oflice on campus. 
Once again, we're indebted to the "Holy Cross Courier." alumnae magazine of Saint Mary's. The "Courier" carried a picture of Steve O'Boorke, who was killed in the Bulge Battle, as mentioned above. The picture, of Steve and his chaplain, was taken in Salis­bury, England. Mention is also made of Ed Xncent* who was wounded at Corregldor with the paratroops. We'll try to have more on him later. Another part of the magazine mentions Jim 3Ieai:her» saying he is in the Pacific directing LST landing boats. Just what these boys are doing in the St. Marj*'s alumnae magazine I'll leave up to you. 
The "Scholastic" presented a special number honoring the spring graduates of *45. There were a few familiar faces. Arthur 'Bod* Andorson, who started with us In Brownson Hall way back in '40. then left in *41, has been back to get his Bach, of Science. Bud also got his ensign's stripe. Tom Kane made the grade also, after 16 months in the Army Air Corps. SEark 3fcGrath, who left for the Rolling Prairie Novitiate in his junior year, got his A.B. at the graduation. He looks ver>' good in the cloth. After a term in the Army Air Corps, Tony Resize was another, of the boys to make good. And after eight months in khaki Dick Sadowttki returned to gain his degree. 
That's all for a while. But we're waiting to hear from more of you. If you have word on any of the boys about whom inquiries were made, drop a line and the word will be passed along. Addresses furnished on request also. And if you're not getting the 'Alumnus' regularly, and are still in the service, drop a line to the Alumni Office at Notre Dame. They'll try to fix you up. for free. If you're out of the service, just a decent contribution should swing the deal. 
If you're '44. let's write a letter. 
For his ability and tireless elTorts In his command of an LCT in the assault of southern France, Fnuik Garibaldi, Hoboken. N. Y., has been promoted to lieutenant, (jg). He has since been assigned as public relations officer on the flagship of LOT Flotilla 20, a unit of the Sth amphibious force.

Eddie Hanyzewski recei\*ed X-ray treatment in St. Louis to dissolve a growth on his elbow which has prevented him from pitching for the Cubs since a year ago last May. Two former All-American football rivals, Marine Lts. Paul White, of the University of Michigan. and Ancelo Bertelli are now teammates on the third Marine division football team in the Pacific 
T/4 John Banm, Forest Hills, N. T., won the Silver Star while on a volunteer mission. He was temporarily assigned to another com­pany of the regiment and was returning to his unit when he learned that the outfit had no radio communications. He stayed with the company and maintained radio contact for them until nightfall. Then when the company was ordered forward, he and a small patrol crawled up under machine gun fire and heaved hand grenades at the Nazi emplacement until enemy fire was stilled. When the patrol re­turned it had eight German prisoners. 
Bits about 'em: Sgt. Dick Reedy, Aurora. III., was In an Army hospital at Camp Carson, Colo.; Pfc Ed Nn^ent, Loveland, Colo., who won the Purple Heart on Corrlgedor, is still APO, San Francisco; Lt.

Impressions of Pfc. Jim Keefer, Fort Wayne, Ind.: 
"I had a really fine time in Tel-Avlv. First day back there I went to a dance at the Allied Service Club. Incidentally, that's quite an amazing place and a likeable one. It was the first time I had had a glass of milk since I left America. There's most everything there: a beach club, snack bar, and a place called 'The Ark.* While there we saw 'Wilson.' The biggest coincidence In my life happened. In the movie, Wilson was Just signing the Ver­sailles Treaty of 1918 and on the screen came a slide saying that the war was over.

The existence of a volunteer ambulance driver Is plenty rugged, but the letter from Ed IXToortear makes It sound like a pleasure tour through Europe. From Austrln, he writes, ". . . .

CHICAGO CLUB OFFICE 
(Continoed from Page 6) 

From a Veteran in Italy: "Am enclos­ing $10 money order as my contribution to support the placement work prognram of the club. Glad to see a venture of this sort going into effect and hope, if all goes well, to make some practical use of it." 
A Veteran in the Pacific Writes: 
"The idea is a swell step forward. Many of us in the service may be re­leased at a time when things are a bit tough and we'd appreciate a lift from some of our own boys. I, for one, was not particularly satisfied with my civil­ian occupation prior to entering the Navy so you can see I'm darned inters ested in your plans." 
From Another Member in the Navy: 
"I'm sorry that I haven't taken an active interest in the Notre Dame Chi­cago Club, but have been in the Navy since graduation. Naturally, I'm inter­ested in your postwar plans—^having no job to go back to. My hope, upon my re­turn, is to be able to make contacts through such an organization as you are planning for a postwar career." 
In the very near future the Vocation­al Committee is planning to send an an­nounconent to employers in the Chicago metropolitan area advising them of the opening of the office. Also, a letter will soon be sent to the alumni in service telling them what is being set up for their use.
