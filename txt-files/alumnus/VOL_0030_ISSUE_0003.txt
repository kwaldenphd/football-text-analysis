Response to' Father CavaiMugh 
Testimonial Fund Increasing 
There's still time for alumni and other friends to participate in the Father Cavanaugh Testimonial Fund. The response from alumni, in recent weeks, has been exceptionally encour­aging. During a four-weeks period par­ticipation increased two-fold as the re­sult of more activity on the part of Alumni Clubs and Foundation repre­sentatives as well as direct mail solici­tation from the campus office. 
The 10th Annual Alumni Fund, which began with the new year, will also receive credit for alumni gifts hon­oring Father Cavanaugh. Your contri-" bution is credited, if an aliunnus, to both the Father Cavanaugh Testimon­ial Fund as well as to the 10th Annual Alumni Fund. 
Clubs have been urged to attain 100% participation of alumni members and various groufK are working hard to achieve this goal — not an impos­sible one with many clubs. Notre Dame has been a leader in the first ten col­leges and universities more than once with respect to percentage of alumni givers. Regardless of amount (one buck up) your gift IS appreciated and it aids in the effort for high partici­pation. 
Alumni are not only asked to fulfill their own personal obligation to the University but also to encourage those friends outside the alumni ranks to give. Since the organization of the Notre Dame Foundation in 1947, the number of non-alumni participants'has doubled annually with the exception of one year. 
The new building program and the work on Steam Plant expansion are both progressing. The Morris Inn, gift of the late Mr. E. M. Morris, '06, has been in operation for the past month. Dedication of the I. A. O'Shaughnessy Liberal and Fine Arts building high-lifted the weekend of May 24th. The Associate Board of Lay Trustees as well as the Councils of Commerce, and Science and Engineering met on the campus May 23-24. According to ad-mim'stration officials the O'Shaughnessy building will not be ready for use until sometime in 1953.

1.
 The alumni advance sale, for contributing alumni, opens June 20th, and closes July 14. 

2.
 If you contributed to the 1951 (Ninth Annual) Alumni Fund, or are a Religious, and have not received your application blanks for the ad­vance sale by June 20th, advise the Alumni Office immediately. 

3.
 The attached diagram of the Notre Dame Stadium indicates the situation that prevails in the case of a popular home game. Oklahoma, Southern California, North Carolina, and Pittsburgh will bring general pressures, probably in about that order, in 1952, for the N.D. home .•schedule. 

4.
 Maximum alumni section capa­city is 14,000, and from this total number are deducted the monogram tickets (all alumni) and the East Side season tickets (mostly alumni and administration or faculty), no longer being sold, (none since 1941). 

5.
 Only about 4,000 alumni section tickets are bet\vecn the goal line and the 50-yard line. But there is not a really bad seat in the Notre Dame Stadium. 

6.
 Because of much more difficult and limited ticket allotments in the stadia away from home, the Athletic Department has had to invoke geo­graphical limitations for the distribu­tion of application blanks to those alumni in the a:amc area. For rames

like Michigan State this means almost the immediate area. For Texas, it means the States in the South and Southwest and lower Mississippi Val­ley. Nav-)', in Cleveland, does not present the same problems because it is considered a "home game." And in the case of personal attendance planned by alumni for games at ;i distance, early request for such re­ception can sometimes be taken care of. 
7.
 In the case of "pressure games" both at home and away, the supply­ing of blocs of tickets for Club use is practically impossible, although the Athletic Department makes extra cflTort to recognize the demands on the "home Club" by games away.

 General application forms for games involving public sale will be sent to all alumni.

NOTRE DAME 




Books 

THE AMERICAN APOSTOLATE (Newman Press, \Vcstminster, Md. .$4.25). Edited bv Rev. Leo R. AVard, C.S.C, '23! 
.\s we have pointed out, the .\LUMNUS does not set itself up as a literarj- or theological review, but there are books which come to our attention which have special alumni interest. One of these is the above volume, most attractively printed in 298 pages, containing eighteen essays on constructive achievements of the Church in the 20th Centuiy. 
In addition to Father Ward's own experienced hand, and an opening essay on "The Church in America," by him, the book contains several other chapters by Notre Dame alum­ni and faculty members: "Preparing for Social Action 1880-1920" by Prof. Aaron Abell of the histor\' depart­ment; "Specialized Catholic Action," by Jim Cunningham, '44, one of the founders of the Fides Press: "Personal Responsibility," by Julian Pleasants, '39; "The Indomitable Schools," by Bernard Kohlbrenner, head of the University department of education; "The National Catholic Welfare Con­ference." by William F. Montavon, '98, 
recently retired head of the legal de­partment of N.C.W.C.; and "The Press and Communications," by Dale Fran­cis, former head of the University pub­lications. 
The presence of this Notre Dame galaxy of authors, and the timeliness of the subject generally for all alumni should make this a book of persona! appeal.—^J. E. A. 
Stonehill Commencement 
The Alumni Office has received the First Commencement announcement from Stonehill, the Congregation of Holy Cross college at North Easton. Massachusetts.

Ambassador Hotel—Embassy Room Los Angeles, Calif. 

I am sure that Universal Notre Dame Night has again demonstrated Notre Dame's high place in America's esteem. I am sure, too, that the Los Angeles Club has demonstrated tonight the strength and unity of the Alumni Association which is at the service of Notre Dame. On behalf of the Association, I would like to express our appreciation for the leadership you have given both the University and the Alumni Association.

The St. Joseph Valley Club (South Bend-Mishawaka and nearby vicinity) honored the guy who actually has been 'Man-of-the-Year' for the past twenty-five of them. James E. Arm­strong, Alumni secretary since 1926, was presented 'the scroll' for outstanding services as chairman of the local $1,000,000 Catholic High School fund-raising campaign and for direct­ing the Alumni Association affairs so capably.

Ike Liked at Mock Convention 
Climaxing a harried two-night bal­loting in the N. D. Drill Hall, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower won the stu­dent nomination for the presidential office of the United States at the stu­dent mock Republican Convention held in April. Governor Earl War­ren of California received the nomi­nation for the Vice-Presidency. 
Eisenhower received a total of 730 votes, which far exceeded the neces­sary 603 for nomination, to win on the seventh ballot over Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio, who received 455 of the 1.205 votes cast. 
New St. Mary's History 
If Notre Dame men are as in­terested in the history of St. Mary's College alumnae as they have always been in the College across the road, Marion McCandless's new "Family Portraits," the Alumnae History of St. Mary's from 1879 to 1949 will be a vital volume. Due off the press May 27, the book compiles the rich personal knowledge of Miss McCand­less, a graduate of the Class of 1900 and founding editor of the Holy Cross Courier, Alumnae Secretary, and popular St. Mary's Club visitor to the four comers of the alumnae world. 
Since so many alumni families con­sist of "one part St. Mary's" there should be many $4 checks forwarded to the St. Mary's College Bookstore for this reminiscence. (Don't let that Class of 1900 fool you. When young­er ideas are had, the author of this new volume will have them—and can express them. The St. Mary's Cour­ier has been for 25 years a most re­freshing literary experience, aside from.its other significances.) 
Rutgers Professor Lectures 
Dr. Selman Waksman, professor of microbiology- at Rutgers University, delivered a series of three lectures on his specialty at Notre Dame on March 31, April 1 and 2.

g|OT[^ETICS 
FOOTBALL The appointment of Johnny Lu-jack as assistant coach and the annual Varsity-Old Timers football game highlighted the abbreviated spring grid workout as Head Coach Frank Leahy began preparations for the 1952 season. Notre Dame's 64rh gridiron campaign. Lujack, who played on the Nation­al Championship teams of 1943. 19­
46. 1947. came back to his alma mater after playing four ycai-s with 
Coach Lujack and Coach Leahy. 

the Chicago Bears to replace Bernie Crimmins former backfield coach. Crimmins had resigned in January to become head football coach at Indi­ana University. 
In the Old Timer's game, May 10, Leahy's varsity romped to a 33-6 \'ic­tor\' with three young backs who are expected to lead the 1952 team into what has been dubbed the toughest schedule in Irish histon' next fa)), pacing the five touchdown attack. Quarterback Ralph Guglielmi, hero of last year's Southern California game, directed the varsity offense, scored two touchdowns, and passed for another. 
Among the Old Timers returning for the contest were Jim Martin, Doug Waybright, Gus Cifelli, Bob Lally, Ernie Zalejski, and Steve Oracko, all members of the 1949 un­defeated National Champions: Frank Gaul, '48 tackle; Jim Mello, '46 full­back; and John Yonakor, '43 .\11­.'^merican end. 
BASKETBALL Lerov Leslie. Notre Dame's star 
10 The Notre Dame Alumnus 
S ^"' 

senior basketball performer from Johnstown, Pa., was recently named the most valuable player on the 1952 College All-Star squad that played the Harlem Globetrotters in the "Worid Series of Basketball". In 16 games, Leslie scored 203 points for an average of 12.7, a new record for the series. He also set a new single game scoring mark with 27 points in the game played in Kansas City, and his 12 baskets in that contest were another high. Leslie holds Notre Dame's single game, single season, and three season scoring records, and has started more games (73) and played in more (74) than any other Notre Dame basketball player. 
BASEBALL Good pitching, no hitting, was the story of the first half of the 1952 baseball season which saw Coach "Jake" Kline's Irish nine break even in 12 contests against collegiate op­position. Notre Dame dropped four other games to professionally domin­ated sen'ice teams. Juniors Jim Gibbons and Stan Ko­nopka, sophomore George Moresco and Jack Reynolds, and freshman Tom Bujnowski, all flashed good pitching form but the anemic Irish hitting held them back. The team had a .232 batting average after 16 games, with only 19 of their 124 hits being of the e.\tra base variety. 
TENNIS Victorious in four of its first six matches, as the ALUMNUS goes to press, including the opening three, Notre Dame's veteran tennis team looks like a sure bet to better last year's five won, si.x loss record. Capr. Tom Overholser from South Bend and Ken Angyal, first singles man last season, form the nucleus ol the squad. 
Hugh Bums announced his resig­nation as Irish trainer, elTective July 
1. He has been named trainer for the professional Detroit Lions football team. Bums has been on the Notre Dame athletic staff since 1943. He was voted 'Trainer of the Year' on two occasions and is in great demand as an after-dinner speaker. No suc­cessor has been appointed. 

GOLF 
With four monogram winner.i, Capt. Bill Fischer, Tom Matey, Joe Moresco, and Frank Marzolf, playing near-par golf. Rev. George L. Holder-ith's charges won five, lost two, and tied one in the first eight matches of the 1952 links season. The Irish de­feated Indiana, Wisconsin, Valpar­aiso, Loyola, and Bradley: lost to Purdue and in a return match tD Wisconsin, and drew with Louisville. 
TRACK 
After a successful indoor season climaxed by the winning of the Cen­tra] Collegiate Conference meet in the Notre Dame Fieldhouse, the Irish track team had its share of troubles in outdoor competition. 
The cinder squad, under the direc­tion of Ale.x AVilson in his second year at the helm of the track fortunes, finished second to Indiana in a tri­angular meet between the Irish, the Hoosiers, and Purdue, and dropped a dual meet to the University of 
Jim Harrington—his father, Paul, captained the Irish track squad in '26. 
Pittsburgh outdoor before they were able to defeat Michigan Normal and Bradley in a triangular event. 
The young track squad features two of the best pole vaulters ever to compete under the Irish colors. The sophomore duo of Jim Harrington and Joe Springer has meant valuable points for Coach Wilson in every meet this season. Harrington has gone 13' 9%" for a new Notre Dame record, while Springer's top is 13' 
5/2". 
Archbishop O'Hara was the featured UND Night speaker in Tulsa. 
LEHER FROM ONE WIFE 
(Ed. Note: The following beautiful tribute was received from the 
wife of an obviously fine alumnus. To keep his ego normal, 
.names are omitted. But we feel that other wives may share 
these sentiments, all N.D. wives should.) 
Dear Father Cavanough:— 

The other day I was telling a friend what a great school Notre Dome was and his remark was the sort you must hear very often. Said my friend, "It is a good school but being the father of a family of girls, I am interested in girls' schools." 
It makes me realize I had come a long way in my own appreciation of Notre Dame. Don't tell anyone. Father, but when I was being courted I thought it would be much better if my fiance had been the graduate of a co-ed school. There wasn't any reason for this, just an idea of mine. Well, I don't know what I've learned in the nine­teen years I've been married but this I do know . . . Notre Dame is just as important for girls as for boys. 
Our children will grow up and marry and we hope that they will please God when they do. Just as I fervently hope Notre Dome is our son's school, so do I hope that our daughter will be given the same happiness that began for me in the Log Chapel in 1933. It wasn't long before I knew that my husband's school hod given him something more than reading, writing and arithmetic. When his {ob called for a difficult decision he made it with great integrity. I knew this could not have come from good parents alone but it hod been fostered and grown under good education. 
In our family he has shown the sort of leadership we often read of as desirable but wanting in family life today. It is a deep and last­ing pleasure to remind the children that Dad does it "this way." He often explains to them the spiritual practices he learned at school; best of all, we like the way he lives what he soys. In our community he has assumed more than his shore of leadership. It has been the sort of leadership that makes me sparkle when I identify him as my husband. 
So you see. Father, I think you are doing a first rote job of making husbands for us girls. And what husbands! If you can give our towns and cities leadership like this, we will all have a better place for our children to live. 
I just wanted to tell you how grateful I am for Notre Dame. There will always be a, Devotedly yours. Alumna in-law 
UND Night Greatest In 

History of Alurhni Clubs 
"Bigger and better" is trite. But when it is accurate and documented, what else can you say? The following pages indicate only a part of tEe im­pact that the 29th Annual Universal Notre Dame Night made on the growing world of Notre Dame. New 1952 boundaries of geography, of alumni, and of friends, greeted the deeply rooted annual tribute to the development of the University. 
Father John J. Cavanaugh, C.S.C., '23, obser\ing his last U.N.D. Night as President of Notre Dame, address­ed a gala meeting of the Notre Dame Club of Los Angeles, on the "official" Night, Monday, April 21. (Observ­ances actually covered the "octave.") 
A special national radio program was presented from Washington Hall on Tuesday, April 29, through the cooperation of WGN-Mutual. Writ­ten by Francis Coughlin of WGN, the program pointed to the rich cultural and intellectual heritage of Notre Dame training, and the achievement of the University where young men "choose to aspire above mediocrity." (Copies available on request. Ad­dress Alumni Office.) •; 
On Easter Sunday, April 13, the Notre Dame Glee Club was featured on Ed Sullivan's Toast-of-the-Town T-V show in New York, an annual highlight. On April 20, John Noland, Glee Club soloist, was featured guest on the Fred Waring T-V show, and on Thursday, April 24, the Glee Club was featured on the Dumont T-V network program. This Is Music. 
In addition to these national pro­grams, many local radio stations car­ried Notre Dame programs adapted from Ray Donovan's publicity port­folio for Clubs. And TIME maga­zine featured an article on Father Cavanaugh, based on the observance of the Night. 
A record number of campus speak­ers were enlisted for local Club meet­ings, and campus films supplemented other Club programs. These appear in detail in the Club reports and pictures that follow, starting on page 12.

Konsas City 
FATHER CAVANAUGH'S visit to the National Catholic Education Association Convention pro­vided alumni in this area with the first oppor­tunity in many years to welcome a President of Notre Dame to Kansas City. Other highlights since the last report have been the celebration of Universal Notre Dame Niglit on April 26 and the increasingly popular weekly luncheons. 
Approximately cight>--five alumni, parents of students and friends of Notre Dame gathered in the ballroom of the Hotel President on April 15 to welcome FATHER CAVANAUGH to Kan­sas City. Although the principal purpose of Ws trip was to address the Naaonal Catholic Edu­cational Convention, the luncheon was fitted into a bus>- scliedule and left all of those attending with the feeling that \%c should have more campus people here in the future. 
JOE STEWART was Master of Ceremonies for the brief luncheon program. Officers of \-arious Catholic organizations and Club Officers were introduced before Father Cavanaugh made his remarks. He brought alumni and friends up to date on recent campus developments in education and touched on the current building program. In a subsequent discussion with Club members, he outlined a suggested program for the 1932-53 year whicli should provide maximum development of the local alumni organization and w*hicli has been adopted as part of the next year's program. 
Club Treasurer DICK PREZEBEL did his usual efficient job of nose-counting and coin collecting. Club President BEN OAKES gets credit for the planning and administration of the luncheon and this report would be incomplete without a special complimen:ar>* note' for JOE STEW.ART who moved the - program along briskly and with touclies of humor. 

ED and TOM REARDON, FATHER BITER, BOB PENDERGAST, HENRY MASSMAN and LOUIE McGEE occupied a table directly in front of tlie speaker's tabic. FORREST COT­TON and FRANK and MRS. TYLER were next door at Table No. 2, A short distance away sat Mr. Higgins, Vice-President of Radio Station KMBC who has two sons at Notre Dame, one in the Seminary and one In the University. JOE SHAUGHNESSY, OTTO SCHMID and the two JACK WHITAKERS (Senior and Junior) were interested spectators and behind them sat BOB METZLER, JOE VAN DYKE, BERNIE FINU­CANE and RUSS FARRELL. JIM AYLWARD and DAVE CROOKS were at the "left end" tabic closest to the door. (As In the days of the West Dining Halls, this strategy was successful— the>- were ser\ed first!) ED McGRATH and JOHN DUG.-\N compared notes at Table No. 5 and JOHN O'CONNOR. CHUCK FRIZELL, Mrs. Helen Owens and GENE VANDEN BOOM sat at paints of vantage at No. 6. TIic Medics were more than adequately represented by DOC­TORS D. M. (he never misses!) NIGRO and BOB NIGRO and DR. JIM DOWNEY. 
JOE O'BRYAN made the trip up from Hiat­viUe for the lunch and sat next to ED GANNON of Chicago w-ho was In town on business. BILL SH.-\RP, back in Kansas City for International Paper, was seen on the south side of the ball­room along witli CHARLES STEVINSON who occupied one of the south wall seats. GENE MURR.\Y got away from his automobile business to attend and, to our knowledge, engaged in no '"trade-in" discussions while the affair was in progress. 
The Kansas City Club celebrated Universal Sotre Dame Night on Saturday, April 26, for tw*o reasons: 1) the national radio program was not received locally; 2) most alumni here are un­derstandably reluctant to keep late hours and engage in spirited social calistltenics on Monday nights. 
The April 26 celebration at the Olathe Na\-al Station turned out to be successful for about 85 alumni and friends and concluded a year which spanned eight or nine successful activities. Seen for the first time In many months were JIM and BETT\- MARTINEZ and VINCE and MRS. DcCOURSEY. RUSS and MARY LOU FAR­RELL and BOB and MRS. MEVSIER arrived early and ^^•ere re^varded with a table near the door. 
This report couldn^t be completed without a reference to the Club's weekly lunclieon at the Famous Restaurant each Tliursday. If you people In the office of the Alumnus mag are interested in building a case for an ad%*crtlsing rate increase, we can support your claim by stating that several out-of-towncrs have **secn it in the ALUMNUS"—and appeared at the lunch­eon when they were in town. So, you can alter that Philadelphia paper's slogan somewhat and advertise: *'In America, almost everyone reads the ND ALUMNUS magazine." (Ed note: Why the *'almost," Mr. Bowes?) Among the \isitors have been ED BRENNAN '38 of Chicago (he was planning to get married April 26) and BILL SHARP—back from New York.

Father Cavanaugh received wel­coming greetings from Lieut. Gov. Goodwin J. Knight on behalf of the State of California, the Hon. Roger Jessup, Chairman of the Board of Supervisors, in behalf of the County of Los .An­geles, the Hon. Fletcher Bowron, Mayor of the City of Los Angeles, in behalf of the city, and the Hon. Ed Davenport in behalf of the City Council of Los Angeles, who presented Father Cavanaugh with an embossed copy of a resolu­tion passed by the City of Los Angeles, welcom­ing Father Cavanaugh to Los Angeles and offi­cially extending him the greetings of the City. 
Dr. Fred Fagg, President of the University of Southern California, in a most sincere and per­sonal talk, expressed his great friendship for Father Cavanaugh and, aside from the welcoming remarks of Archbishop J. Francis A. Mclntyre and the talk of Father Cavanaugh, was easily the outstanding speaker of the evening. 
Those present were also favored by being able to hear from the two living Laetare Afedalists residing in this area, the HON. JOSEPH SCOTT, who will foon celebrate his eighty-fifth birthday, recipient of the Laetare Medal in 1917, and Mrs. Irene Dunne Griffin, recipient,.of the I.aetarc 
• -Medal''in'^1950.-.*/:•. * * ' --'••" Archbishop Mclntyre spoke glowingly and favor> ably of the opportunity he had recently in at­tending the Natural haw Institute at the Uni* versity of Notre Dame and complimented Father Cavanaugh and the University on the part they are playing in the moral rearmament of the country. The recent talk of Dr. Conant, of Harvard University, was no small part of the Archbishop's* talk as well as that of Father Cav­anaugh. Father Cavanaugh again demonstrated his humble greatness and humility in his talk, mentioning his own career and the ivisdom of the Canon law requiring his retirement after completion of two terms of three yrars each. Like the .Archbishop, he dealt in detail on Dr. Conant's recent talk at the Educators' Associa­tion, condemning the privately endowed siJiools. Father Cavanaugh demonstrated in kindly but definite statements the fallacy of Dr. Conant's reasoning by showing that the entire theory of the .American way of h'fe was based on the dual system of education. 
Entertainment was provided by Miss Carole Richards, of the Ralph Edwards show, who is seen and heard five days weekly on radio and television. Donald O'Connor, current star of "Kngin* in the Rain" and remembered for the part he played in the several Francis pictures, and his partner, Sid Miller, entertained with songs and dances, much to the amusement and enjoyment of both the Archbishop and Father Cavanaugh as well as all those present. 
ROBERT KELLEY, President of the Notre Dame Club, presided and turned the meeting over to LEO B. WARD, Past President of the .Alumni Association, who ser\'ed as loastmastcr. MR. T. B. COSGROVE, Trustee of the Univer­sity, responded in behalf of the Notre Dame Club of Los Angeles to Father Cavanaugh's remarks. His sincere friendship for Father Cavanaugh and the University is best evidenced by his most sincere and heartfelt remarks over Father Cav­anaugh's retirement as President of the Uni­versity.

"If anyone is divisive." Archbishop O'Hara. former president of Notre Dame, declared, *'it is Joe Stalin." 
Speaking at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel here. Archbishop O'Hara said "we understand there arc people with different goals in education than ours and that they have some fear of the growth of Catholic schools as destructive to . democracy. 
•'Sometimes I wonder w'hat they mean wlien they say dcmocrac>'. If any man is divisive today it is Joe Stalin. In the world in which you live, you will see all sorts of possibilities. Vou nci'd not concern yourself with the left wing of these possibilities if tlie right wing is alive."

1911 
Fred L. Steers 
105 S. LaSalle St. 
Ciikago, III. 

Among the change of address notices received by me last month was one stating that WILLIAM 
R. RYAN of the class of '11 died on December 20, 1951. I do not recall seeing any obituary in the columns of the ALUMNUS. 
BILLY RYAN was one of the lovable, well known characters on the campus during my flay. Although not a large man, he was a halfback on the football team in '09, '10, and 'II and a pitcher on the baseball team in those years. He was one of the leading, if not leading, actors in the college dramatics of the period. He was a quiet, easy going comedian who made life easier by giving many of us a good laugh and some­times by the tricks he pulled, the laugh was often on ourselves. A few days before our grad­

ST. JOE HAU REUNION 
Much interest has been evi­denced in the reunion of ex-St. Joe Hollers—those who lived in Bodin before it developed wings. Some 50 or 60 plan to attend on June 6, 7 and 8, the highlight is a buffet luncheon on Saturday. 
The Committee on arrangements is comprised of Father Ray Mur­ray, Frank Forrington, Pat Mo­loney, Joe Farrell, Jim Boland, Hugh Carroll, and Bill Schmitt. 
All St. Joe Hollers are invited to attend. 
uation, old John^ one of the night watchmen on the place, pointed to him and said ''There is a fellow that can make a success of a lot of things, among them a lawyer, a baseball player and an actor." Truly, Billy was what the collegiate slang of the day would term an all 'round guy and I am .sure that many others of our period have a fond recollection of him. 
40 YEAR 
REUNION 
JUNE 6-7-8 
Here is a copy of the letter JOE McGLYXN 
has sent to all the members of the class inform­
ing them of the plans for their 40-Year Reunion. 
"My felicitations and best wishes. Undoubtedly 
you have received JIM ARMSTRONG'S letter 
addressed to the Class of 1912 with regard to our 
40lh reunion on June 6, 7 and 8. at Notre Dame. 
Forty years are a whole lot, and those of us 
who have surx'ived them have undoubtedly reached 
and passed our "three score." I know- tliat many 
of our fcllou-s live quite a distance from Notre 
Dame; all of us arc really busy, trving to make 
enough money to pay income taxes, and have any 
number of immediate excuses that we could give 
as our regrets for our inability to be present at 
this reunion. AVlio are we kidding when we do 
this? Nobody but ourselves. .Anything worth­
while requires at least some little sacrifice that 
we cran make that will pay sucli big dividends as 
getting together with a select group of old men 
who once were boys, living together, sleeping to­
gether, eating together, studying together, playing 
together, having our little pet peeves and griev­
ances among each otiier, all culminating 40 years 
ago come next June. 
*'Unfortunately, many of our boys and pals of 
1912 have passed to the great beyond and will 
n.^t be able to be with us; the chances arc that 
come our 41st reunion some of us will have 
taken our place among their numbers. 
"JUDGE (Bud, to you) MARCELLUS OSHE, Vice-President of the Chicago Title & Trust Co., and I have talked about this for a long time, and arc really looking forward to a wonderful three days under the Golden Dome of our Ahna Mater. The University, Alumni Association, Judge Oshc, and I arc all committed to a pro­gram of festivities of good food, of good wine, and the greatest fellowship in our reminiscences, in catdiing up with what the other fellow has done in the past 40 years. Won't you please immediately mark your calendar for attendance at Notre Dame on those three days and make your plans right now? 
"I am enclosing a mailing list which our old pal FRED STEWART, of Hol^-^vood, Florida, was kind enough to have mimeographed and sent lo me, enough copies to go all the way around. Look it over and it certainly will bring back to you fond memories of fine fellows. It may be that you can add a name or two to the list as it is not complete. Pick out some of your intimate pals, whose names arc on here, and drop them a personal letter telling them that you are going to be at the reunion and urge them also to be there. 

"Already I have letters assuring the presence of FRED STEWART, JOHN P. MURPHY, BEN KAISER and good old CHESTER (Muggsy, to you) McGRATH, the old left-handed plrchcr and halfback of our days. Won't you please imme­diately write a letter to JIM ARMSTRONG, JUDGE OSHE, or to me, telling us that you xvill be with us?'*

Our Class Registration takes place in the respective halls to be used by the various classes. The Class of '17 will bunk down and make headquarters in Howard Hall. Friday evening we will have a class get-together. Sat­urday's activities include a Class Mass, golf, foot­ball movies from last year. Moot Court finals, and the .Alumni Banquet with all the trimmings. Sunday winds up our activities with an Alumni Mass in the Main Church. It appears as if wc are all in for another great reunion. 
In addition to BERNARD J. VOLL, the per­ennial and popular host to the class, a Local Committee consisting of JIM BOLAND, SAM FEIWELL, LEO BERNER and JOHN GUEND­LING is working on the reunion weekend. Re­member it's to be June 6, 7, 8. 
Wc had the distinct pleasure, on April 21, of witnessing the Pittsburgh "Notre Dame Man of the Year" award to one of our outstanding class­mates, LEO J. VOGEL. 
The occasion was the Pittsburgh club's observ­ance of Universal Notre Dame Night at the Pittsburgh Athletic Club, and the honor of pre­senting the award went to another good se\-en-
The Odcm Family 

teener, DR. LEO O'DONNELL, who did a fine job as toastmoster. 
Speaker of the evening was DR. O'GRADY of the Notre Dame faculty, whose talk was re­ceived enthusiastically by the audience, which in­cluded Joe Barby, new coacli of the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
LEO VOGEL is in cver\- respect a fine alum­nus, and the award he received was well de­served. Congratulations from all your class­mates, Leo! 
Included in the 'returns' was the interesting picture of MR. AND MRS. ODEM and their family of six boys and one girl. 
Everything points to a fine attendance at the 35th-year reunion and certainly there will be a great time. Don't miss it. Break your neck to be there if necessary. You'll never regret it.

—you cannot hold '22er& down. Just before meet* Ing Jerry, I had lunch with TOM McCABE. We had much pleasure in recalling the many wonderful events and incidents of the 23th Class Reunion. 
"Please give my kindest personal regards to the boys, keeping a good share for yourself, and be assured that even though I am not personally present on June 6, 7, and 8, Til definitely be living those days with you in my thoughts and prayers." 
Here is a nice tribute to our good classmate MAL GOOLEY now deceased, as printed in the Syracuse, N. Y., Post Standard of January 10. 
"A man who never forgot his loyalties and who gave immeasurable loyalty to his Abna Mater, Mai Goolcy has gone to join many of his friends of bygone football days, but the friends he left behind aren't likely soon to forget Mai. Xotre Dame was his University, and Notre Dame men down through the past three decades have known him well and admired his unflagging spirit." 
The A. Harold Webers and the Aaron Huguen­ards were visiting in Florida early in the year.

It*s been a long time between news items for you '25'ers! Your secretary is going to review the past few months. 
The last letter I received was from ED ASHE 
of 134 N. Anita Ave. in Los Angeles. This was 
given to JOHN BURNS before he went to the 
hospital but never published—so here it is: 
"Dear John: 
"Thanks for your card of March 25. would have answered it sooner but decided to wait until after Universal Notre Dame Night when I would pos­sibly run into some of the old boys haWng a night out. 
"FATHER JOHN LYNCH was on hand to offer 
grace for the dinner and enlighten us with a few 
words of wisdom. Father John is located at 
Xotre Dame High at Sherman Oaks where he is 
liked by the faculty and students alike. 
"BION VOGEL was chairman for the evening 
and really put on a good dinner followed by 
some excellent entertainment. Frank Fay, star 
of "Har\ey'* on the New York stage, acted as 
M.C. and introduced such guests as Ralph Dun­kie. Eddie Garr, Wallace Ford and Irene Stan-Icy, Jr., who entertained with songs just like her mother before her. 
"DR. BILL MALONY was there with his dad, DR. WILLIAM, SR. VERNON "TEX" RICK­ARD of '24, looking as youthful as ever, was on hand. 
"I u-as in San Diego last week and called on 
J. HAYES FULLER. Hayes has been laid up several months with a disc out in his back. On my previous trip in February I called on him at the hospital where they had him in traction with a ten-pound weight on each leg and in plenty pain. He was up and around last week and is able to carry on hb insurance business again. 
"BILL CLEMENS is living in the same parish 
with me but as yet I haven't seen him. I tried 
to reach him on the phone this evening to report 
on his activities. I understand that he is also 
in the insurance business. 
"As for myself, I am in the aircraft sales busi­
ness, specializing on electrical equipment. I have 
also gone into the manufacturing biisiness, spe­
cializing on electric switches for airplanes, radar, 
etc. I plan to make a flying trip east late this 
month or early in May. My tentative plans coll 
for a stay- in Washington and Dayton, Ohio. 
"Please remember me to all of the boys in the 
Toledo area and will be glad to hear from any 
of the Class of '25 if they have any occasion 
to visit the West Coast. Sincerely. Ed." 
The get-togethers at the Southern Methodist and Purdue Games were a success. I hope-I 
May-June, 1952 29 
can remember llic ones who had sandwiches and coffee at the Monogram pre-game lunclicons. DON MILLER was at both games and we had lundi together before the Detroit and Michigan Slate Games. Don, as you may have read last fall, resigned as United States Attorney and is practicinc law on his own again both in Cleve­land and Washington, D. C. JOHN "RED'* KANE has taken over Don's duties, with the aid of FRANK STEEL of Akron (1019 Amelia Ave.)­Frank was the last '25'cr IVc seen. He and his charming wife were in looking for HURLEY";. furniture last week. Frank's oldest son is in the seminar>' and they have two girls, and their voungcst is another boy. 
H.ARRV STUHLDREHER was in Toledo a few weeks ago. H^rr>' is with United States Steel Co. doing public relations work. Harr>- said his oldest boy is in the Xa\->*. another son at Yale, and his third bov is entering Xotre Dame Uni­versity. (When ' Harr>- told FRANK LEAHY about this, Leahy was eager to know what he played. Harr>- replied, '•Tennis!*') His youngest is in high scliool in Pittsburgh, where they have made their home these past few years. He tells nic that "0.\TS" BYRNES still shoots a mean game of golf! (Evidently "Oats" doe>n*i feel as old as the Toledo '25'ers.). 
The local Notre Dame Club gave a stag party for the "Old Timers" and the Class of 1925 was included in this categor>-. PAUL DOOLEY, BEN KESTING, RAY TILLM.\N, BOB PIERCE AND your "Sec" were among those present to receive a nice Notre Dame ash tray and serving spoon. Wc didn't feel so old when BOB COO-NEY's ('26) father, JLM COONEY, of the Class of '88, received a plaque for being Toledo's old­est grad—he can still out-run any '25'er. 

BILL BELL (New York), HERM CENTLIVRE ^Fort Wa^•ne). CHUCK COLLINS, GEORGE LOUGHLIN, WALTER METZGER, BERNIE LIVERGOOD, ELMER L.\YDEN, LEO POW­ERS (all of Chicago), JOHN ELLIOT (La Crosse, Wise.). and JOHN DROEGE, BILL CERNEY and EDDIE LUTHER (South Bend), were at pre-game luncheons: and we certainly hope to do this again next fall! 
Received word of CHARLES ST.ANHOPE's death. I have written to HENRY WURZER, our treasurer, to have a Mass said for Stan. By the way, that fund is so low that I'm sure there isn't enough for Stan's Mass—so let's start the fund growing again. Send a dollar and a letter to Hank. He'll keep the money and send the note to me for our column news. Hank's ad­dress is: Mr. Hcnr>- C. Wurzer, 307 Kahl BIdg., Davenport, Iowa. 
WALTER "Butcher" H.ACKER called me on the phone last month—just passing through To­ledo on his way back to Nashville, Tcnn. He's connected with a firm manufacturing road-build­ing macfainer>'. 
Just received word from South Bend that BERNARD FINNIGAN's daughter, Eileen June, is niarr\'ing a good friend of my son, Robert Mahowald, who's a junior at the University! 
JOHN ELLIOT was at one of the prc-gamc lunclieons and all the wives agreed that he was the youngest-looking '25'er in the crowd. John is Vice-President and Managing Director of the Hotel Stoddard in LaCrossc, Wise, and he would be happy to sec any of the lads that may be passing through his town. 
Here's news—HARRY McGUIRE, whom no one seems to have heard from in a quarter of a century, writes that he is in good health—just got married and is living in Santa Barbara. California. 
HARRY STUHLDREHER also told me that he had seen ED HUNSINGER (2108 Arch St.) in Philadelphia and he looks fine. I believe Harry said he was in the electrical appliance business. 
Well, that's all for now but don't forget to mail - that DOLLAR for MASSES. Remember *'Tcmpus Fuget"—*'Memento ^fori"—'.hat buck could be for a Mass for your best friend of the days of 1925.

of the New York World-Telegram and 
Sutiy recently received the Inter-Faith 
Gold Medal presented annually by the 
Four Chaplains Memorial Committee. 
The award was made in recognition of Ed's efforts against narcotics traffic, Irving Geistj chairman of the awards committee, said. The medal commem­orates the torpedo sinking of the USS Dorchester, February 4, 1943, in which four chaplains gave their lives. Earlier recipients of the medal include Presi­dent Truman and State Supreme Court Justice George J. Beldock. 
Before coming to the World-Tele­gram, Ed served with Associated Press, King's Features, the Times Syndicated, the New Brunswick (N. J.) News, the Newark Star Ledger and the New York Post. He married Miss Margaret Jose­phine Ryan of Columbus, Ohio, and they have three children. 
cently reinstated our class presiden*, RAV DURST, and our classmate, ART BIDWILL. At the same time we returned to membership DICK NASH, '23, RED MAHER, '24, and JIM MARTIN, '23. Subsequent to that meeting. HAROLD COOK, '24, and DR. BERNARD PEELE, '41, came into the Council. These new members, all of whom were at one time members of the Notre Dame Council, joined our old time members: TOM COOK, '24, JOHN LACEY, '38, JOHN LYONS, '29, ED OTOOLE. '25, LEO PO\VERS, '25, JOHN RYAN, '26, LAW­RENCE RYAN, OS, TOM SEXTON, '33, FRANK KEATING, '49. Leo and all of us here in the Council are continuing our cfTorts to bring more Notre Dame men back to the K. of C. and, in your secretary's opinion, there might be some­thing you fcllow*s could do in other areas. 
For some reason your secretary- has not been able to get up enough ambition to send out cards to you fellows with the result that like Will Rogers "all I know is what I read in the news­papers." In a recent issue of the Wall Street Journal, I saw that CHARLEY HOLLOWAY had been made . merchandising manager of .1 the Furniture, Rugs and Draperies Divbion..of,'Mar­shall Field's here in Chicago. ' ,In,anotlier^',.p'ai>er I saw that AL KIRK Jiad.j beeni»transfcrrcdxto. the New. York Headquarters, of: thci. Boy Scoutsjl'. I didn't get a chance to check,on - this but I wonder if he tookJ;.the place of KEN COOK, whose transfer was reported in the last issue of the ALUMNUS. Some time ago one of the papers carried a picture of DUTCH O'D.Ws daughter at the time of her wedding. 
.%t the recent Chicago Notre Dame Club Uni­versal Notre Dame Night dinner, the class of '26 was represented and your secretar>- talked with or saw R.AY DURST. JIM RONAN, DR. TOM LEAHY, JOE RIGALI, and BOB a^REY. 

In a recent column, I suggested that if you fellows were interested we might stir up some enthusiasm by some **Do You Remember" items. I got one response from BERT DUNNE which I have been holding, for Bert came up with the suggestion that wc ought to get these memories and put them in book form and offered to assist your secretary in doing the job. The offer of assistance was appreciated but it seemed to me that the assistance should be the other way around for Bert is the old author, not your secretary*. He gave me a couple of pretty good items but I don't want to repeat them just at this moment. Perhaps somebody else will come through with something and maybe we can stir something up. 
25 YEAR REUNION 
JUNE 6-7-8 
Frank Moran 633 East ^fonroe Street South Bend, Indiana 

Less than one month now! Recently the sec­ond full dress meeting of the local committee of the class was held at the home of our reunion chairman, HERB JONES. Present, besides Herb, were RAY HUNT, STEVE RONAY, PAT CO­HEN, PAUL BUTLER, FRANK MORAN, SE­BASTIAN BERNER, and our class president, MIKE SWYGERT. In the course of a vcr>­pleasant evening, details of final organization Were discussed and committees or skeleton com­mittees assigned, to be filled in by the respec­tive chairmen from other local alumni. 
For the Fridav exxning class dinner, PAUL BUTLER will act as chairman, MIKE SWT­GERT will preside, and JOE BOLAND will 5cr\*c as toastmaster—a talent-studded trio. Our treasurer, STEVE RONAY, will have charge of registration at Lyons Hall, Steve collecting the money as I check off the names. RAY HUNT and SEBASTIAN BERNER will take care of room assignments, and JOE BOLAND, PAUL BUTLER and AL DOYLE are dusting off their memories in order to recognize and receive re­turning classmates. Starting with a close study of the '27 DOME, they will have a nice job of visual reconstruction, twenty-five years' worth. PAT COHEN and his refreshments committee arc already well launched. 
Here is a note to Hunt and Berner. JACK PATTON and JOE O'DONNELL expect to get to the reunion and would like a room together. If any others have such arrangements in mind, it might be well to drop a line directly to Ray or Sebastian. 
The following comes from JOHN GEARY: 

"In one of the greatest concentrations of '27 graduates, I believe I can hold the record of seeing fewer classmates than anyone in our class. I talked to JOHN HALFIN several montlis ago —he is doing fine—^just bought a home in Elm­hurst and has a verv* wonderful family. Also saw JOHN SLATTERY some months ago. He is busy keeping Crucible Steel out of the red. 
*'I saw BILL HOLLAND when I was in Indian^Mlis a fc\v- weeks ago. He is fine and looking forward to the reunion. Was very-surprised to hear that my old roommate WIL­LIAM B. (BILL) SULLIVAN of the New Berlin. Illinois, Sullivans, was back in Indianapolis. Tried to get'in.; touch with him but his ofHcc claimed he w-as out._working whicli I found hard to be­lieve know*ing'Bill as I'-do. 
"My family is pretty well grown—John J. is away at College. Jean Ann-'enters St. Teresa's at Winona, Minnesota, in Fall. Graduates from St. Xavier's this June. Bill,"our youngest (15) is in his second year at St. Ignatius. 
"As for myself. I had a rather bad run in w-ith arthritis, back in 1944—spent most of 1945 ,in bed .but h^ve improved greatly and now get 
around with only sliglit diHicuhy. I du take it 
easy, however, but then I guess none of us are 
the kids we were 25 years ago. 
"I saw a program for the reunion. ED MC­
LAUGHLIN sent it out and it looks vcr>- inter­
esting and I am looking forward to seeing 
cver>'onc and having a wonderful weekend." 
The following letter was sent in by CHARLIE 
0*NEILL: 
"I hope that it will be possible for mc to make the reunion, at least the 7th and 8th of June. Mar>*, my wife, and Maureen are going to L. A., Califbrnia, to visit her mother about that same time and there is just a little question about shifting some plans around. At any rate. God willing, I will make the reunion. You know I selecled the Class of '27 rather than a later one because my closest friends and fondest mem­ories are all tied up with my Freshman year. I ran into EMMET BRO\\'N at the Southern Meth­odist game last year and knew him right away although I had not seen him since I left school. If that is any criterion, then I suppose we will all quickly recognize each other although those whit have lost their Iiair. or whose hair has turned grey, may be a little difficult at first. I am very happy to see the names of several of the men I knew on the committees. It is nccessar>' to have someone do a lot of work on things like this and the committee members are the kind of men who can do it! 
"I will let you know in plenty of time if there is anything which will preclude by attend­ing the important occasion.'* 
DAN CUNNINGHAM reports the following: 
"The New York-New Jersey 1927ers held a bull 
session at the New York .Athletic Club last 
Tlmrsday, March 27. Dinner was ser\'ed inci­
dentally! Your fellow faculty member, DICK 
SULLIVAN, could have collected enough material 
for a second edition of "Notre Dame." 
"Eighteen of the gang held forth. .And I mean 
held forth. We also had GERRY CUDDIHY 
of the Class of 1924, cousin of our host, JACK 
HICOK, who did a wonderful job of arranging 
a very fine party. Those contributing to the 
noise were: CHUCK and PAUL BERETZ, ED 
BRODERICK, JIM BROWN, BILL DAILY, 
GERRY FROELICH, JACK GRUNING (who 
left us early due to a previous engagement). 
BILL HEARN, JOHNNY HOWARD, JIM 
JONES. FRANK KANE, DICK LLOYD, ART 
MONACO, JOHNNY NYIKOS, BOB SHIELDS, 
RUPE KENTWORTH and of course, JACK 
HICOK and myself. 
**In my last letter to you. I reported on some of the fellows whose names appear above. How­ever, since I have more complete (and recent) information. I shall go down the line and re­port on their activities. • 
"CHUCK BERETZ is with Royal Motors in 
White Plains. N. Y. Anybody needing a Cadillac 
can contact him there! He is married, lives in 
Yonkers, N. Y., and will be back for the reunion. 
"PAUL BERETZ is a partner in W.* C. Gil-
man & Co., who arc public utility engineers and 
financial consultants. He Is a financial analyst 
of utility companies and securities. He is mar­
ried and bas two sons, aged 13 and 2, and lives 
in Great Neck, Long Island. He also plans on 
being on hand on June G. 7. and 8. 
"ED BRODERICK is practicing law in Mor­
ristown, N. J. Ed is married and the father of 
four. He too, will be back. 
"JIM BRO^VN is Treasurer of South .American 
Minerals and Merchandise Corporation here in 
Net*' York. The company exports and imports 
minerals. Jim is married and has two daughters, 
Christine and Mar>' Ann who are 13 and 8 years 
old. Jim is also going to be back for the 
festivities. 
"When I talked to BILL DAILY, he thought maybe he would be considered a member of the class of 1928 just because he got a degree that year, but I pointed out that 1927' could not allow its Junior President to secede—the south to the contrary. Even that unreconstructed rebel, Wcntworth agreed. So Bill will be with us in June. He is with Employers Mutual, in charge of the Claim and Legal Departments in the Eastern United States. Bill is married and has three children, a daughter and two sons. 
"GERRY FROELICH is with Curtiss-Wright Corporation, not Wright .Air as previously re­ported. He is doing wage and salary* stabiliza­tion administrative work. Gerr>- is coming to the reunion if he can, but isn't sure. He is 
:still a bachelor. 
SPOTLIGHT ALUMNUS 
Francis R. Cawlcy 

Francis R. Cawley, '33, Director of the Office of Budget and Management of the United States Department of CommercCj recently was presented a gold medal. This is the highest award granted by civilian departments of the government and is for outstanding con­tributions to the public service and the nation. 
Frank entered federal government service in 1933 as senior clerk of the NRA. In view of his oustanding rec­ord. Congress recently established the position in which Frank is serving (Di­rector of the Office of Budget and Management) as one that would re­main available only so long as occupied by the incumbent. 
Despite his rather heavy government career, Frank has found time to serve as a lecturer in public finance at the University of Syracuse, Georgetown University and Florida State. He has an LL.B. from Georgetown and has been admitted to practice to the Dis­trict of Columbia and United States Supreme Court Bars. 
"JACK GRUNING is practicing Law in Brook­lyn. Jack will also be back. He is married and has five children, four boys and one girl. 
"BILL HEARN's new business, I find out, is called 'The Auction Barn.' Bill appraises and auctions personal property of all kinds. The business is new and Bill is working hard to get it well established. He will also be back for the reunion. 
"JACK HICOK is New York District Manager for Hotpoint, Inc. He, too, plans on making the reunion. Jack is married and has one daugh­ter, age 12. and lives in Hastings-on-thc-Hudson. 
"JOHNNY HOWARD is stili with the New-York Telephone Company. He is a commercial manager. Johnny is married. He also is plan­ning on returning to school for the reunion. 
"JIM JONES, whom I see often, lives in Lyn-brook, has five children and is uncertain dbout being with us in June. He will be there if possible, however. 
"FRANK KANE, one of my roommates in Freshman Hall, is now Treasurer of Sweets lah­oratories. Inc., manufacturers of chewing—and bubble—gum. The night of the dinner, Frank had a little trouble defending the pFopositioD, that bubble gum manufacturers were human be­ings. All the fathers present disagreed! Frank has three children of his own, so perhaps he will learn. 
"DICK LLOYD is ivith the Xe^v York Sute Department of Public Highways and lives in Babylon, Long Island. He is working on the design and construction of Parkways and Express­ways. Dick is married and is hewing to be able to be with the gang in June, but is still tm­certain he will be able to get away from the job just then. 
".ART MONACO is selling commercial ad\-er­tising art for Jaeger & Earl, Inc., in New York. Art is also uncertain about being able to be at the reuiiion but will try. 
"JOHNNY NYIKOS is City Manager for Chev­rolet in New York. He is married, has a daugh­ter and son and lives on Long Island in New-Hyde Park. John will be at the reunion. 
"BOB SHIELDS is with the Bankers Com­mercial Corporation, managing a territory in New* Jersey. The company is in the automobile finance business. Bob has been In this line since leading school—except for his time in the Army. Get Bob to tell you the story of his ''life in the Army*' sometime. He is married and has a five-year-old daughter. You can ask him about the Army in June because he'll be back with the rest of the gang.

Jack, a Braniff "million-mile" pilot, effected a landing at 130 mph and guided the 30-ton aircraft to a stop with both the wheel brakes and flaps inoperative. As the plane slowed to a stop, the pilots opened the door and dropped ropes out which enabled the passengers to slide to the ground safely. A few minutes after the last passenger had left the plane, the airliner was con­sumed in flames. 
Passengers were lavish in their praise of Jack, saying that his landing was the "smoothest they had ever seen."

I watch the nine-year-olds thumb their noses at

Skiing calls to mind an evening tcith *BUD* or

"I hope you can glean something out of 
my rambling." 
And to collaborate on a portion of Jim's news 
letter, wc pass along this one from BUD WIL­
HEL&fY, San -Antonio. Texas: 
"It was a pleasure to hear from you and I hope what little news I can furnish will arrive in time for your May 1 deadline. First of all, I have ever>- intention of making the 25ih Re­union. It is with great interest that I read the Alumni Nc*vs, not only to keep abreast of cur­rent events at the University, but news of for­mer schoolmates affords one an opportunity to reminisce and creates an increasing desire to get gang we lived with for four years. 
'"My most brilliant coup before or since grad­uation was my marriage to Mar\- Elizabeth Kane back to ?\D and spend a few da>-s with the of Pittsburgh in 1934. I have been blessed with three wonderful children, a daughter, Elizabeth. 7, two .sons, John. 14. and Bruce, 16. The daughter has the Irish wit and sparkle of her mother and the boys are good, healthy specimens who can make anyone's well-stocked pantr>-_look anemic in short order. The boys have particu­larly adjusted themselves to the Great Southwest. John is a fresliman in high school, played fresh­man football and basketball, had straight "A's* for his first three quarters and was voted the most representative freshman. Bruce, a sopho­more, has deivloped into a good basketball player and is an arid hunter. Incidentally, WILLY *WATERW1NGS' CRONIN is Bruce's godfather. Saw a lot of Bill when he lived in Dayton and wc lived in Columbus, Ohio. Believe Bill is now in Oakland. California, and would like to hear from him. 
"During the time wc lived in Columbus, JOE R«AN, '30. was our next door neighbor and would see the two Cannon boys occasionally. JIM BRADY was stationed in Columbus for a time during the war. That was somewhat of a re­union for both Lib and myself for she went to the Woods uith Marian. Jim's wife. Jim was a traveling Chamber of Commerce for Idaho and was responsible for Lib and myself vacationing at Sim Valley a few years ago. Jim. Marian, and their two oldest children, joined us for a weekend and I wiU admit that Jim's claims for his native state were understated. After seeing Jim and his family ski down Baldy Mountain, you could easily tell why the little guy never let size bother him on the football field. 

"I tvorked in Chicago and Jived in Highland Park from *47 to *5I and naturally met many ND boys from all classes. Of the *twcnty-niners' I saw Grace and JOHN N.-\SH and their little daughter quite frequently and. speaking of fami­lies that make you envious, JOHN (barrister, oil man and promoter) DORGAN and his lovely wife. Dorothy, deser\e a lot of credit for raising five of the best. 
"My mi«^spent youth on the golf course plus a comfortable handicap gave me just the edge I needed to gather in a few of Dorgan*s nickels after 18 holes of golf. Xeverthcless, his family still looks well fed.

The first thirty days wc invested the family jewels in air conditioning. We arc now residing in San Antonio and am president of Brown Express, a common carrier motor freight line which scr\*cs all the principal cities and most of the small towns in Texas. That is a plug, Larr>-, but the boys should know the best carrier over which to route their Texas freight distribution. 
"Joined the local club on Universal ND Night for a dinner party at the Menger Hotel. His Excellency, Bishop Mongeau of the Philippine Islands, was the guest of honor and gave an ex­cellent talk. He is a dynamic little man who is responsible for starting fourteen high schools in the Philippines since the end of World War H. These schools have a total enrollment of 7800 students and each one is named Notre Dame followed by the name of the city or province in which they are located. Needless to say. Notre Dame always wins in tlie athletic contest between the schools. The Bisliop related that MOOSE KRAUSE, in the Naxy at the time, was the first to present their original school with athletic equipment.

Members of the class of 1930 were shocked to read newspaper reports of the sudden death of TIM MOYNIHAN. His death resulted from in­juries suffered in an auto accident near Orange, California. Tim was a plastering contractor in 
May-June, 1952 35 

Santa Ana during the recent years. The cla.*<s of 1930 vill want his wife, Mabel, and son, Jackf to know that Tim ^vill be remembered frequently in prayer. 
Universal Notre Dame night WAS the last din­ner and meeting to be presided ovrr by BOB HOLMES, outgoing president of the St. Joe Valley Alumni Club. He gave the club an ex­ceptional administration during his year's tenure, and the members presented him with a monogram blanket for his \-aluablc service.

JAMES "JACK." O'KEEFE wrote an excellent description of his farm near Ulster, Pa. He sent along some colored photos of the family and countr>*side which made his report all the more viWd. Here's hoping Jack's health improves rap­idly so he can give Skyline Farm the full atten­tion it dcser*"cs,

ART KANE came through with a very inter­esting letter to bring us up to date on his activities. He writes: 
"IVe been intending to write in and bring the ALUMNUS up to date regarding my status, but have consistently put it off until tomorrow. Comes now your 'Heard But Not Seen' section of the '31 gang giving a slightly erroneous ac­count of the Kansas Kanes. 
"So here goes, just as it happened: I did resign my position as advertising manager of Southwestern Gas and Electric Company in Shrcveport, La., and I am now advertising manager for the Empire District Electric Com­pany. However, there is a slight detour on the road from Southwestern to Empire. I came by way of the Furniture and Undertaking business in Baxter Springs, Kansas. After a spell at cov­ering up doctors' mistakes and peddling chairs, or a few years and three kids later, I sold my business and went back to the 'word factor>*.' 
**I still live in Baxter Springs and Che\ToIet back and forth every day. It's about a 15»­minute drive from garage to parking lot. Empire is an independent electric company scr\*ing an area 100 miles wide by IIS. miles long, with 
62.000 customers in Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma and .\rkansas. Our general office is in Joplin. Mo., where I hang my bat. However, recently, there hasn^t been much hat hanging. I've been spending roost of my time on American Airlines flagships between Joplin, Chicago, Dallas, St. Louis and intermediate points * of disinterest. 
'*In my many stops I have endeavored to get in touch with some of the old guard from NO but have succeeded in making connections only with BOB HELLRUNG in St. Louis, then only by telephone. 
^'Before I go any further, let me make a correction on the number and names of the Kane kids. First, there is Mary Alice, 13; Michael Richard, 5; John Dennis, 3, and Eliza­beth Ann, 19 months. I might add that mommy turns the kids loose in the neighborhood in the morning and by noon that end of town looks as though a junior model tornado had made a tour of inspection. 
"In this neck of the woods, we seldom sec anyone from T^otre Dame. Wc seem to be ofT the beaten path or something. I do see BOB BRAECKEL now and then. He is one of Joplin's leading architects. Then I bump into MORTON DOUTHIT from time to time. He is busy as can be. Has a funeral home and a chicken ranch. I hear from MOON MULLINS up at Manhattan, Kansas, occasionally and he keeps promising a trip to the Ozarks . . . hasn't made it >-et. .And that Is about the only contact I have with the outside world of ND grads. 
*'Guess this will straighten things out for a while. Of course, I don't blame anyone but myself for the misinformation that found its way into the columns of the ALUMNUS. I should report a little more often maybe. At any * rate, with X D 'bull sessions* so few and far between 
in these hills, I certainly do appreciate and took 
forward to recei\*ing the ALUMNUS, and may I 
urge you to keep up your good work o{ re* 
porting." 
F, X. MURPHY from Roswell, New Mexico, 
came through with his stamp of approval on the 
last issue of the ALUMNUS. He writes: 
"The 'growl' I wrote you sometime ^ o was 
never intended for the purpose to which you put 
it but there is enough of 'ham' in mc so that 
I enjoyed seeing it in print." 
He mentions RED O'GONNELL and BILL KERRIGAN and himself as the "unholy three" in Father Albertson's biology class. I am sure no further explanation is necessary for any others who happened to be in the class. JOf Mc> QUAID, operator of "The Little Big Shop" known as Mac's Magazine Rack in Vincennes, Indiana, was in Chicago the weekend of Fefaru* ary 17 and called on the phone. He wrote later enclosing a copy of the Adams Basketball Score Book of which he is official distributor. If any of you have young boys or scout groups inter* ested in basketball, I think you should order a few copies from Jim as it contains all the latest "dope" on basketball. Also, don't forget that Jim is anxious to handle all subscriptions or re<­ncwals of your favorite magazines for home and office. The other day while at the loop, I -ran into GEQRGE COSTELLO. He looks very well after his stretch in the U. S. Navy during the war. George has three children and is connected with the Collector of Internal Revenue, South Side Office, 7919 South Ashland Avenue. He was 
asking about HAROLD STELZER and CLIFF FISCHER, his former roommates in Freshman Hall. HAROLD STELZER is a buyer in the motor division of Scars, Roebuck and Company. George also mentioned HARRY E. KENNEDY, and I see by a change of address notice from the University that Harry is now located at Hotel Del Prado, Barranquilla, Columbia, South Amer> ica. Harry, how about a letter bringing us up to date on your activities. I met BOB PEN­DERGAST who is looking quite -thin since taking up landscaping of his new home. He said he had a call from BUD TOUHY. Bud had a few hours in Chicago between trains on his way to the \Vest Coast plant of Republic- Aviation Company. EDDIE RYAN recently saw JOE SULLIVAN who brought u5 up to date on his brother. Bill, in Florida. Bill is in the ready-mix concrete business and now has four children.

As this is written, cvcrv'thing paints to a record turnout for the 20th Reunion and all credit is due to CUFF PRODEHL for the mag­nificent job he has done in promoting it. He has worked for months on the various mailing pieces which JOHN BURNS maiU>d from thr campus. Cliff is still at it to insure cver\-one getting all the information, and then to have a grand time when they get there. 
DICK SULLIV.AN writes from Rochester that ever>*one in that area will be there. HERB GIORGIO has arranged special cars for ilie group around New York City. TEX SIMMONS is heading a group from Dallas, and JIM IGOE says c\*crybody wtU be tliere frnm CIjJcagi>. Tlial is just a cross section of the ansxvers received a month before the Reunion starts. 
Have YOU sent Cliff a note wih a couple of bucks pinned to it as requested? 
ED 0\M.^LLEY, the eminent East St. Louis attorney and class treasurer, and his wife have just been blessed with their fifth cliild.

1933 
Joseph D. A. McCabe, Secretary­
632 Forest Ave. 
River Forest, 111. Dear 33'ers: Hear ye. hear ye . . . it*s tiine and more than time to point out tlie fact that our 20­year (shudder) reunion is approacliing fast . . . almost as fast as these 20 years have rolled away, Yurrah. Jads next year, next June is it: make plans now, while yet these "32ers are ring­ing out the eclioes of the year before the Year. If you fig'ire on going now. even the multiple problems of a large family won't be able to keep you away—with luck. Give the little lady a u-aming right now. and then about once a month for a year, and you'll have a fair cliance of get­xing our of the starters* gate without conflict of plans .. . in fact, tvhat most likely will happen is tliat she'll remind you. and keep you from making that golf date you might othenvise wind up with. 
The 20th get-together is in lots of ways the big one. It calls for some serious thinking as well as plans for social mixers down at the Bend. We all have a lot to be thankful for . . . and Sacred Heart Church and the Grotto are about the best places I can think of ut say 'Thanks . . . for these last 20 years.' 
In some %*-a\-s 1933 seems two or three worlds ago. It's at least one era back . . . the pre­atomic age. .4nd for most of us there have been lean years sandwiched among the good ones, for one reason or another. But for all who can get down to ND next June, and for the maiority who can't go—, lets say for all of us—it should be a time of recollection and gratitude. Tlie heads that bow in prayer when we gather may be a little shinier in spots than they were when wc doffed the mortarboard for final prayers in 1933, and it may be a little tougher to genuflect 
provement. Let's offer a Iieartfelt Deo Gratlas for all oui blessings . . . and murmur a prayer that we can advance a little faster along the spiritual as well as the material highway. 
Perhaps its the influence of the approaching reunion, but your slave can announce with im­measurable satisfaction that he has again been showered with mail . . . two letters this issue. 
First communication was from VINCE BURKE, who played quarterback on the squad way back there in '33. Vince writes as follows: 
*'I am practicing law here in Pittsburgh and have been doing so continuously since 1936 as a member of the Campbell, Houck and Tliomas firm. I was finally married last January 26 and BOB FULTON of our class was one of my ushers. 
"Bob in turn is being married on May 24 and both myself and LARRY SMITH arc to be mem­bers of his wedding party. Bob is presently adi-ertising manager of the Vernon Benchoff Co, here in Pittsburgh. 
"LARRY SMITH is with the McBec Co., which is a firm specializing in Bookkeeping systems. 
**I have recently had some correspondence with ROGER P. BRENNAN, who is practicing law in Cleveland with the law firm of Jones. Day. Cocklev and Rcavis. 
"I have heard from CHARLEY J.ASKWTHCH who is Jiving in Kenosha. Wise. »fherc he is athletic director of the Kenosha Schodl System and is. I understand, quite happy in Ins work. Chuck has three children, two boys and a daughter. 
**SMOKEY COUNE, another classmate, is liv­ing in .Allison Park, a suburb of Pittsburgh. He is married and the father of four children. He is with the Pennsylvania Manufacturers* -Asso­ciation, an insurance company. 
*'JOE KURTH, fomieriy of Madison, Wise, is living in Greensburg. Pa., about 30 miles East of Pitisburgli. where he is district representative for the Millers High Life Beer. 
"CHICK SHEEDY, another classmate and Pittsburghcr. is. as you know. Father Sheedy. C.S.C, of Notre Dame. 
"P.AUL GR.-\Y, from Pittsburgh, moved to Cali­fornia after the war and has not been heard from since. 
**I received quite a shock at our Notre Dame Luncheon a few weeks ago. I sat down beside a stranger who spoke pleasantly and knew my

name. Inquir>- developed that it was AL BUT­LER, who is living in New York and is with the Lloyds Insurance Corporation arid was just here in Pitt, on a business trip. 
"I used to sec JIM SHAY quite often in New York where he was associated with his father's printing business. 
"Last fall while in New York, I ran across BILL HIGGINS on the subway. He lias quite a responsible position with the New York Daily News and is still single. 
"BOB FLINT, who is also single, is practicing law in Coudersport. Pa. He is an occasional visitor to the office when he comes to Pittsburgh. 
"TONY PUGLIESE is married to a Pittsburgh girl (a St. Mar>-*s girl) and Is an occasional visitor here. He is happy as an Executive with International News Ser\-ice in New York. 
**NORM GREENEY is with the Cleveland Trencher Co. and is living somewhere jn Texas. I saw him last winter in Chicago. 
"I have ^een and talked to NORDY HOFF­MAN several times in the last few months. He is with the Political Action Committee of the 
C.I.O. and is living in Washington, D. C. He

gets to Pittsburgh quite often because of tlu-
C.I.O. main office being in Pittsburgh. '*I saw DON MARTIN on the street recently. He is in the real estate business here." 
Thanks loads^ Vince—best of luck and get in the habit of batting off a letter to the column, it might help us keep the franchise. 
Here's our second letter, from BILL ROBI-SON's better half—and when it comes to writing letters, she certainly is! As Mrs. Robison points out. Bill's address was incorrectly listed earlier this year. To make amends, the correct address is Box 388, Mountain Grove, MISSOURI (in caps, just like you said. Mrs. R.!) This. letter contains a stirring appeal, for a ver\- worthy cause. AVe hope youMl read it. and if you can. contribute something, it will look good on your deductions next March. 
"Since receiving THE NOTRE DAME ALUM­NUS. March-April. 1952. we have had this fine discussion in our home: *Must write to Joe, and tell him it is Missouri, not Maryland!' The days pass, and still no letter finds itself written. May I take the 'bull by tlic horns,* and play secrctarj' to my husband? 
"I don't know what My Honorable Boss would write. und»;r these circumstances, but because yo« want some correspondence out of the class of 1933, perhaps it would be well to just sit down and let this trusty old broken-down typewriter do tlie work. 
"We left our native Iowa for the 0/.ark Hills about September 1 of '51, deserting 'city dwell­ings' for life in a small town. We find this truly a wonderful place in which to live. Tlie climate is mild as compared to the cold Iowa winters and the scener>* is beautiful. Occupation? The chicken business, in an expanding, we hope, broiler country*. It is a far cr\'. true, from a while-collared job as an accountant, for which my husband was trained. I suppose, but the compensations are ever so much greater. Life is so uncomplicated—or is it ? At least, one can go and come, being assured that these friendly Nlissouri people will take tlie minute to pass the lime of day pleasantly before transacting any­thing so distasteful as business, 
**In addition to correcting addresses, as it were, thi.s letter M'iU serve a dual purpose and one more important than putting us in the right Male. 
"Undoubtedly you have attended Mass in all the big churches, all over the United States, as we have—Chicago churches. St. Pat's Cathedral in New York. Boston churches. Washington churches. San Francisco churches. Have you ever attended Mass in a poor mission parish, in a church that will scat 65, with a congregation of over 100? Did you ever see a church fairly bursting at the seams? Come down to our hills before 1952 is over and done with, and we will show you what happens when we gather 1009^-. 
"The problem of course is a new church. We will have one before 1952 is over and done with. Our pastor. Father Robert Ready, requires of each family, one of three things: $300, 3130 hours of labor, or 300 hours of prayer. Few families will be in position to give the $300 (this is a poor country-); some cannot give the 300 hours of labor; so I assume I am backed by someone's 300 hfjurs of prayer «hcn I turn beggar for Sacred Heart Church. 
Ed KiHccn, '33, and his family. 

SPOTLIGHT ALUMNUS 
Franl W. Howland 

Frank W. Howland,, '25. has recently been elected to the presidency of the General Agents Association of the Mas­sachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Com­pany. Frank, who is General Agent with Massachusetts Mutual, recently com­pleted 25 years of service with the com­pany. He is a past president of the Rockford Association of Life Under­writers, a past director of the Illinois Association of Life Underwriters, a past president of the Memphis General Agents and Managers Association, and a director of the Detroit Life Under­writers Association. 
Before moving to Detroit, Frank was General Agent for this same company in Memphis, Tenn. 
"The new church will be on the highway (this is Vacation country'), wiiereas now our church is in a rather remote spot, perhaps six blocks south of the beaten track. At the moment, an old hout.e is standing on the future site, and Wed­nesday. Father Robert and one paid workman (and only one will be there) performed their first day's physical work, salvaging every scrap of material available. The women will work, too— wc could do a commendable job of removing the nails from the laths, I think. (Few of us have lily white hands left—but nor for long, I caa see!) The men in the parish will assist Father in the actual construction of the church. Father Robert will build this church, his fourth I believe, in addition to his already all-time consuming days. He has four mission churches—Ava, Mans-, field. Buckhart and Udall—distances apart, in ad­dition to Mountain Grove. Sundays he must drive long distances to say Mass, and there arc times when our 11:30 a.m. Sunday Mass actually starts an hour later. His days are so full it would be difficult for 'city dwellers' to under­stand how he has enough physical encrg>- to keep going—wc wonder too. 
"The new church will seat presently about 125, if I understand the plans correctly, with expansion possible in the future. It will be a small church even yet. but will serxe our needs for the present. It must be built, in 1952 to rate the initial gift for the land purchased. At present writins, wc have to beg for sunctliiiis like $4500 to ^000, which amount, with the gift for the property, will just be the building itself, with no iatetior furalslungs. 
"I am contacting friends, relatives, former class­mates, former business associates—anyone I think might see fit to adopt the Mountain Grove church as his 'pet charity* for April. Wc felt because of the urgency here, that the Class of 1933, Notre Dame, might see fit to contribute something. No amount is too small (even dimes count down here—and many dimes w-JH add up); no amount a too large. Would you, as secre­tary, help in this? And we need help so badlyt 
"Then, we want to know who in the Class of 1933 is still with the FBI, and do you have home addresses? 
"This should give you a fairly complete report of 'Life in the Ozarks.' It is a far cry from living in the city, as you can well imagine, but such a restful way to exist. No thundering ele­vateds, no racing for busses, no pushing to get lunch downtown—in fact, we have slowed down to the pace of the natives, feeling- as jf wc were ones ourselves by now. 
"Thank you for your assistance. Contributions mav be sent to me, or directly to FATHER ROBERT RE.ADY, Sacred Heart Church, Moun­tain Grove, Missouri."

**After reading the last .ALUMNUS I think that some of us had better come along and help FRANK REILLV out w-ith a little copy. I no­ticed that the deadline for the next issue was Feb. 15 so I*m %vTiting directly to you with a copy to Frank in case he wants to change any­thing on it in a hurry. 
'*The Quinns are awaiting the arri\*al of No. 2 old birds have changed. If anything maybe I am only two pounds heavier .. . 

*"I have heard from a few of the boys and wish to pass their news along. BOB SIEGFRIED reports from Tulsa that he is a proud poppa of three children w*ho manage to get into all kinds of trouble (are they different?) His business is as brisk as ever and keeps him stepping. - Last time I saw Bob was in New York at the Statler Hotel after the North Carolina game. Long time no see. but maybe he will get around for the 15ih 
*".A letter frtim WALT NIEN.ABER tells of his new home in Cincy and another • houseful of children. The Cincy gang of '37 arc talking of setting up headquarters at the Oliver for the reunion—open at all hours—like the 10th week­end. Walt has been to Chicago and attended the club's annual meeting w*hich group elected LUKE TIERN.AN as president. He managed to see BILL TUNNEY, ED FOX, JOHNNY COYLE, but no "GAFFER** QUIRK, L.AMBERT, CRONIN. Didn't mention JUD.AE or O'CON­NOR. Those old standbys should break away once in awhile. 
""Other fellows that I can report on are: JOE O'BRIEN, I met in New York one day. Joe had just come out of the hospital after an op­eration. Manages to get around the country quite a bit. Reported he had seen GEORGE L.\NE of late, also that he sees T.AGNEY quite often. 
'".After; the Na\-y game, I went to Washington, 

D. C , for a few days, and managed to have lunch with BILL FOLEY, House Judiciar>* Com­mittee. For once I got a return on my income tax. Bill has a boy, named Junior, lives in .Alexandria, and has a very- nice place in Wash­ington for the fellows to drop in. Practically runs the Congressional Hotel on the side. Talk about rolling out the red carpet. J.ACK W.ALSH, associated with CARE, had dropped in to see him a few weeks ahead of me. 
"J. GORDON MURPH\', Wyoming banker, \-icc-presidcnt. Cheyenne headquarters, is still the single blade and manages to get around the country. Spent a day at ND in the fall and saw a game. Don't see how Gordon can hold out so long???? 
"JERRY CLAEYS runs the Claeys Candy Co. in South Bend and now has four children to provide for. The Bclgiaiu will be outnumbering the Irish in this class if we aren't careful. 
"Lait word from EDDIE REARDON stated he still held forth in Kansas City, had three chil­dren (I hope this is correct). He is associated with the gang in Thomas McGcc Sons, who I am suns Uncle Harry calls on when he goes home to "rest." Eddie should make the reunion and show us how he used to skive in the windows at all hours. 
"The abbot, of our local Benedictine Abbey, at­tended the ele\-ation services for BISHOP 0*HARA, and stated tt was very impressive and told me of all the spiritual bouquets that had been made when the bishop left Buffalo.

"I would like to call to the attention of the .Alumni Office the death of JOHN CAV.ANAGH of the class of '37. John was a Monogram man of the '36 and '37 track teams. He died ver>' suddenly while on x-acation in the Summer of 1951.

From PAUL TULLY: "I Itad a couple of nice visits witli FATHER FRED DIGBY last month and was amazed to see that in his position ns Director of Catholic Charities of Southeastern Louisiana, tliat he is responsible for the opera­tions of nine Catholic Institutions in his area and that he has a staff of 22 employees using up a whole floor of ati Office Building in N'ew Or­leans. He's probably one of the busiest '39ers in the class at the present time. In spite of it all he had time to visit and treat a classmate to some fancy X'ew Orleans meals. 
^'Then in Miami Beach, Fla.. I bumped into BOB BREEN of Chicago who was vacationing down there. He is in the Finance Business in Chicago.

around town. One of his clients is the Arch­bishop of Florida. Since the Archbishop owns every inch of Catholic ground in the state, Charlie's kept pretty busy with that account. Charlie reached the semi-finals in the Florida Men's Golf Championship this winter. 
"Up here in Washington, PHIL MALONEY is doing a big legal job for the Veterans Ad­ministration. GEORGE HAITHCOCK is in Pub­lic Relations uitli T.W.A. TOM POWERS is cartooning for the Xa\-y here in Washington along with handling a large Xav\* publication. 
"The secretarv- of the class of' '39, VINCE DeCOURSEY, to my memory has had that job since he graduated and I imagine Vincc is a pretty busy man in Kansas City in the Ice Cream Business. /Vs a result. I've noticed issues of oiir ALUMNUS when the class of '39 does not have any news. Perhaps it would be wiser to ask the president of our Class, GREG RICE, to invite some other class member to be sccre­tar\* and send a word of appreciation to Vincc for the fine work he's done these past twelve years on that column."

"It has been a long time since I dropped in 
to say hello, but the very empty space in our 
class news of the last few ALU^INU& issues 
has made me feel rather obligated to write with 
the hopes that some others will do the same. 
"Since Iea\-ing the Army Air Corps in IM5 I have been in business with my father-in-law at the Legion Utensils Company in Long Island. After five years of trying to learn the inside of the factory and its workings I am now the sales manager and cover most of the hotels and res* taurants here in the East. 
"I correspond regularly with DON GILLI­LAND, BUD KERR, and LARRY DEVEREL'X. Don is working out of JefT City, Afo., as an in­surance examiner and gets into New York every now and then.

From CAPT. FRANK V. CIOLINO, StafT and Faculty, Transportation Scliool, BIdg. 2201, Fort Eustis, Va.: 
"We people of the Class of *40 should bow our heads in shame for not writing, so as to be represented in the March-April ALUMNUS. Our absence from that issue must have been noticed by all. Therefore, for this issue, I'm 'pitching in' what little news I have. 
^'Bcing stationed here at the Transportation School for over a year has been wonderful. How­ever, I leave in September and back for home, Grenville, Mississippi, and return to civilian life; it will be the completion of seventeen months recall to active duty, and, in fact, the second lime I was recalled. 
"The assignment as Course Director in the office of the Director of Training has been most interesting, especially meeting, working with and getting acquainted with our officer students. The most recent one I met was LT. JOHN W. GUDDIE, who received his Masters at ND; he just completed the l2-week Company Grade Course will) an unusually high grade.

The column this month should set some sort of a record for brevity. Such being brouijht about by 1) absolutely no letters, and 2) a somewhat earlier deadline. Let this current issue, therefore, set forth an appeal to all of you to activate the old pens and drop this- scribe a note. 
Last January' I had occasion to spend a few days in Little Rock, Ark., at a convention. Nat­urally, I used this as an excellent opportunit>' to contact JIM M.ADIGAN. Jim told me that he was recently made a partner in one of Little Rock's larger accounting firms. While in town I spent an evening with Jim, his wife, and three f:hildren. 
Another partnership, a little further west, that was recently brought to my attention was the firm of DON AflLLER and BOB TOWER, at­torneys-at-law. Don studied Law at Har\'ard after bis discharge from the Armed Forces. You can reach him at 1217-A Burlingame, Burlingame, Calif. 
When I spoke to TOM FINUCANE at the Fifth Reunion in 1948. he told me that he was ready to enter the Society of Jesus. This month's Change of Address Notice brought me the fol­lowing address: Mr. Thomas F. Finucane. S.J., Missouri Province Educational Institute. 221 North Grand Blvd., St. Louis 3, Missouri. Our hearti­est congratulations, Tom! The Jesuits landed a great guy. 
Bom to Mr. and Mrs. CLAIR LAMBERT, JR., their third son. Daniel Joseph, on January* 27 in Chicago. 
A letter from EDWARD D. CALLAHAN reads: *'I have left the Ivory System Rcconditioners and am now-a reprcsentatii'c of Dodge, Inc.. out of Wrstfield and Ne«T)ort. N. J. They arc (he largest manufacturers of trophies in the world—this is a swell break for me as I cover the New England area and now no longer have to be. away from home as long as I did travel­ing the midwest." 
LOU RYXfKUS, a former teammate of BERNIE CRIMMINS, will be one of his new assistants at Indiana University. Rymkus has been with the professional Cleveland Browns football team since 1946. He played with the Washington Redskins in 1943 and was in the Na\y for two years. He is mai-ried to the former Miss Belty Wid­mcyer of Nappanee. Tnd. Tlicy have seven-year­old t*vin sons. Pat and Mike. 
(Flash!!!! Here's a later letter from your Class Secretary, I'm just going to leave them both in.—^Your Editor.) 
Bv the time this copy reaches the printed page. BOB LEMENSE should have been separated from bis recall to the Army. Bob wrote from 1216 
S. Center St.. Apt. 4. Sioux Falls, So. Dakota: "The latest ALUMNUS just caught me here in Sioux Falls. S. Dak., where I am just 3'/^ months away (I hope) from completing a recall lour of duty iWth the Army. Thus today ND was brought to mind two ways. 
"First I received notice that T was to repre­sent the militar>- on a couple of committees for Armed Forces Day. My chairman on the '0"een' committee is none other than JOHN BURKE, ND about *41. who is assistant city attorney here in Sioux Falls. . Have had only one short talk with Jack since I've been out here because for over 10 months I was stationed in Yankton. 
S. Dak. Am currently at HQ for recruiting here in Stouic Falls with a multitude of duties. 
*'I w-as recalled in March. 1951. and have «.pent all my time on duty here in South Da­kota w-ith the Army and Air Force Recruiting Serx'ice doing publicity, sales management, and supervisory work. Exception: I went to an Army school for a month last July at Fort Benjamin Harrison near Indianapolis, Ind. Drove up to ND one Sunday then but merely toured the camous by car. 
**Have ten'ativc plans now to enter Law School uhcn and if tfie Army releases me. I may go to the U. of S. Dakota as T have already picked up Law credits there with Army permis­sion last summer. 
"Heard from most of the old cronies last Christmas: JACK DUNLA\Tf who ha-; a column in *Bluebook' and a recent article in the 'Catliolic Digest'; also heard from ART KEAT­ING and others. Didn't hear from HERB BECKER this year. 
My permanent mailing address is always 744 Hamilton Ai'c., Iron Mountain. Michigan." Thanks for the letter. Bob, and I notice that I have almost forgotten your Postscript, "Am still a bachelor." 
Our East Coast correspondent. BILL TRACY, sent along another letter filled with news of s«*v­eral of our classmates. Bill wrote: "Attended the SlySYXJ basketball game at the Garden and the outcome was enjoyed by all inasmuch as wc have taken it on the chin for the past two vcars. 
"I chatted with FRANK CONFORTI after the game; also saw GREG RICE. T attended the game w-ith my brother Joe, his wife, and Miss Joan Montz of Brooklyn. 
"A recent transfer to the New York office of the FBI is my old buddy, NEIL GREENE. Neil told me that HARRY WRIGHT is the pres­ent line coach at Georgia Univcrsit>-. Both Neil and I W'crc happy to hear about the good for­tune of BERNIE CRIMMINS, BOB MADDOCK, and LOU RYMKUS at Indiana University. 
"Hsa anyone heard of the whereabouts of WL L RIORDAN?. I'd like to have Km con­tact me. Jack. I haven't heard from Will since before the \%-ar." There you arc Bill, our pica to 
42 . The Notre Dame Alumnus 
Will Riordan tn contact you. Frankly, Bill, I don't believe I'll ever forget that bone crushing block Riordan threw during the *42 season, when he knocked some poor guy half way to Kokonto. 
Some months ago BILL UNGASHICK passed through Dallas on a sales trip; Bill is working out of Kansas City, and that is about the extent of my dope on Bill since I was out of town when he happened through, and gathered only the above meager information. Also, another of our recent x'isitors to Big "D." as the Tcxans arc \vont to call it, was FRANK HALEY. Frank is warehouse manager for Brach Candy Company of Chicago; Brach has begun a new-warehousing venture in Dallas which, we hope, wilt bring Frank to our city often. Frank mentioned that he had seen WALLY McNA-MARA who represents Brach in the Rockford, Illinois area. 
Wc have here in Dallas an institution called Southern Methodist University which now and then fields a football team. Likewise, here in Dallas wc have sports writers, and one who has just writtrn for the third time of the good for­tunes that SMU lias had in recruiting football talent due to the fact that all these eager lads arc honored to join a team which will play Notre Dame thereby giving them an opportu­nity to face the great Fighting Irish. I have thought each time I have read his article about the little band of lads Frank sends out on the fiicid each Saturday during the fall, and what an honor it must be, tlien. for them to play not against, but FOR, tlic University of Noire Dame.

An annual treat was serx'ed your secretary* recently when the ND Glee Club returned to the East for its yearly concert tour. Easter Sunday night many of you probably heard and saw the "Singing Ambassadors" of the University on the Ed Sullivan "Toast of the Town" TV show. On Easter Tuesday I caught the concert at Summit, N, J., and thoroughly enjoyed their fine program, especially their rendition of the school songs whicli never fail to carry the listener nos­talgically back to his collegiate days. Ex-glcc clubbers among our classmates will be pleased to hear that "Dean" Dan Pedtkc. as jovial and enthusiastic as ever, is stif! directing the singers. His farm north of South Bend is prospering, and his brood ever increasing year by year. I've lost count, but understand he's giving the Frank Leahy's a run for the honors. 
MAIL CALL: A chatty letter from Zahmitc neiglibor, JflM DANAHER, just missed making the last column, so it heads off this one. You'll remember that Jim left the campus in '43 to join the Nax-y Air Corps. After a brilliant naval career, he married and moved to the Sierra Nevada lumber countr>' w-here, for a time, he engaged in timber business. Jim's also taken a turn at being manufacturing agent, security salesman, and for the past three years has been associated with an advertising agency (Brooke. Smith. French & Dorrancc). now working on the Hudson car account, scheduled shortly for the radio-TV department of the agenc>*. Two bam­binos (one for ND and one for St. Mary's) keep him busy at home. 
Excerpting Jim's letter . . . *'I called BOB McKAHN last August when I was in Chicago for the AH-Star game. Bob was in Michigan for the week-end with his wife but I had a nice chat with his mother. He is working for Illinois Bell Telephone Co. as a salesman and is doing very well and likes it a lot. I believe she said that be had three children (if I am wrong he can write to you and correct me). While at the game I sat a few rows behind MARTY KUNTZ of Akron, Ohio. . . . My wife and I were also at the SMU game, but I missed seeing TOM BRENNAN, ARTIE HOFFMAN, and DICK DOERMER. I saw DAVE RONEY and JOHN ANHUT (good Detroit alumni) as well as drop­ping in at JOE DILLON's house for an after the game drink. Joe is rapidly becoming a lumber baron as well as junior papa Dionne. ^ . . All of our contempoi^rics will remember PAUL LILLIS. Paul married a very good friend of mine hailing from dear Ol' Grosse Pointe and is now* living in Birmingham, Michigan."

From the Southlands, specifically High Point, North Carolina. comes welcome news from "Triple T" TED TOOLE, who wants DICK SULLIVAN to know that he is starting to catch up with him in the stork derby. On Jan. 10 last, "Triple T" the Third arrived. Incidentally, Ted married the former Ellen O'Shaughncssy in Our Lady's Chapel with Ellen's brother. Father Bill O'Shaughncssy, O.P., officiating, the latter being the rumpus' latest version of "Snow White." 
Several '+lers got together at the ND-Ndrth Carolina game last fall and discussed plans for forming a sectional club. Ted reports that JIM CROWLEY, JACK JOYCE, JIM MALONE among others were on hand and decided at least one meeting a year should be arranged for the fellows from the southeast section of our land. The boys came up with a great idea for a golf week-end at Pinehurst. Tlie suggestion had the parly meeting Saturday afternoon for a round of golf, dinner in the evening, and a Communion breakfast on Sunday at the local Chapel. "The Column" heartily endorses the plan and sends out a call to all the lads in the southern Vir­ginia. Caroh'nas, northern Florida and northeast­ern Georgia section who'd be interested in such a weekend to contact General Chairman, JIM CROWLEY, c/o Crowley Cotton Waste Products Co,, Sparlansburg. S. C. Sounds like a wonder­ful time is in store and hope the idea catches fire! 
FRANK "FLIP" SANFILIPPO notifies us he is now located in Glens Falls, N. Y. (116 Slier-man Ave.) with the Morton Salt Company. He and his wife are the proud parents of four (count 'em) lassies, the latest addition born this past Valentine's Day. "What GOLFERS they will be! '* exclaims Frank, who you'll recall wielded a mean mashie in his collegiate career. He reports seeing quite a bit of DICK Mc-CABE, ANDY MURPHY, and BILL COUGH before being transferred up north from Rhine-beck, N. Y., last September. Covering the entire Adirondack region of Northern N. Y. is his busi­ness. Frank is anxious for any mates in the vicinity to buzz him for a bit of reminiscing. 
Received a postcard from BILL TALBOT, re­turn address, Coral Beach Club, Bermuda. Some ^uys just rate! And more mail from the hot cli­mates brings the news that JACK SEWELL is a special agent in Holly^vood, Florida, for Pru­dential Life Insurance Co. and has his own real estate business. Going great guns. Jack says the South is the only place for him. He re­quested to reply with a void. Wish one of that gang would write and bring us up to date on all the Peoria crowd. Last I heard, ED CASHM.\N 
(who will be remembered for his smash-hit "Let's Get Going" and other campus iniisicals) was at Catholic University in the Drama Depart­ment, teaching, composing music, and working for an advanced degree. Mail addressed to him has not been returned, and your secretary - is still waiting for a reply. Would also appreciate a line or two from HARRY YEATES, DICK DOEMER. DICK A'HEARX, ED DOWLING, JIM CROWLEY, TOM SHELLWORTH, CREIGHTON MILLER, JOHN BAUM. BILL BOSS, JOE RUD, and others whom we haven't heard from in a long time. "The Column's" deep gratitude is extended in exchange for a few moments of your time and a 3-cent siamn! 
DOMINIC GOETTO has returned to his Law and Insurance business in Joliet, III., following his discharge from the Na\-y. Dominic's address is 316 Ashley Ave. The class of '44 offers its sincere sympathies to Hominic upon learning of the death of his father which shortly preceded his discharge.

A SAD STORY The members of the class recently elected a Treasurer. ' For the past feu- years the expenses of the. class have been borne by your secretary and the University as a part of the job to be done. These expenses have been average but as the class grows and as the real reunion-planning draws closer, the need becomes more acute for 
a working capital. Like all good organizations, money in the bank is the only strong voice. The class needs money to organize better, to 
afford more general mailings, to have a ivorkmg capital for its coming reunion, and to meet the expenses caused bv merely existing. Our treasurer is RAY BADDOUR. In the next issue the d c tails of where to send your dues (one dollar from each member of the class; two dollars for any member wishing to resign) will be given to you. This is merely notice to you to save your candy-money, as it will be asked of you in about t^vo months. Do not send your money yet. Wait for the notice in this column. That is the tem­
porar\' end to this sad s(or>'. 
LETTERS FROM DEPARTMENT From DAVE CHAMPION: "I confess to being one of the *Lazy of the Class' per >-our reference in the January ALUMNUS.

From CHUCK POWERS: "Just a note to tell you that I want to transfer to the class of '45. I am presently included in the class of "48 but want to join the other RO's and all my friends who started in the summer of '42. 
"I have just been advised by the Massachu­setts Board of Bar Examiners that I was suc­cessful on the last Bar examination and will be sworn in next month. I have been living here in Somers»*i.

Chuck, you're the third new member to our class this issue, and it's certainly a pleasure to extend ilic same welcome to you that we've extended to the many w-ho have already written in. Yours is especially a warm welcome because you are from that hearty group of species who had the ncr\c to start right at the beginnint; of the summer, back in May of 1942. Tliat was a big class, as was the class starting in September. Things happened so verv fast after that, that I don't remember. ERC!! NROTC!! V-I2!! M.\­RINESII DRAFT!!

From DON CLAEYS: "Not sure I'm in the class of '45. but certainly want to be. The past year has found me recalled into the Sa\y. For 13 months I was assigned to a Merchant Marine Tanker as Communications Officer. Wc spent practically the whole year running between Saudi. Arabia and Korea. I've just been transferred to the General C. G. Morton (TAP 139). a troop and dependent carrier in the Pacific. I am now an Executive OfHccr aboard, and am responsible for keeping our 1500 passengers entertained. The 125 children under the age of 10 arc rather rough on a single man. Arriving again Manila lomorrov*-—so that's it for now."

From WALTER L. JAWORSKI: ' I don't have any particulars on class news right now. I did belong to the class of '43 but Uncle Sam took care—so I came out with the class of '45. Since I lived off campus. I didn't know too many fellows. I am married, and my wife. Florence and I have a two-year-old boy we named David. 
"As far as being back on campus, J go there daily because I am in charge of all the interior maintenance and cleaning help.

"I interned at St. Joseph's Infirmary- from '46

PAT YAKLOVICH spent a short period in San

will probably be 100 years old before I start in 
private practice. I do see EARL ENGLERT

to New York by his company, the Girdler Cor­
poration. He has three children and is expecting 
his fourth in about one month. I can't get to 
many of our club meetings because of so much 
work, but I intend to some day. Regards." 
THE SAD STORY CONTI.VUED In order to end this column with the same happy thought of. the beginning, namely that of the one dollar dues from each member, the following letter is printed. It comes from the man who will be collector, bookkeeper, and whip thrower of the drive, our treasurer, RAY BAD­DOUR: "Although many things have happened since we last corresponded, I haven't migrated to New York as you suspected. After getting my doctor's degree last June. I spent the summer vacationing in Europe and then returned to 
M.l.T. as an assistant professor in Chemical En­gineering. My home address is 132 Beacon St.. Boston, and my business address is, Department of Chemical Engineering. M.l.T. Cambridge, Mass. 
'"It will certainly be a pleasure to work with you on plans for the 10-year reunion, and I agree it would be nice if wc could get together sometime. If I get to New York. I'll call you as you sav, and if you get to Boston, c:all me either at M.l.T. or at home. In the meantime, send my work to me here at M.l.T. and I'll do my best. Here's to the reunion!" (Ray, just as soon as I get some information from Notre Dame, I will write you and then you can start collecting the one dollar dues from each member. We won't do any collecting until the next issue, in which I'll explain more in detail to the class where and when to send the check. By that time you should have heard from me and received records and check-lists with which to work.) 
S'long to the class until next issue and best regards to each of you.—Al. 
APOLOGIES 
The last issue of the ALUM.NUS quoted two letters from WELTON R. ABELL. In the first one he tells of being happily married and living in St. Louis. In the second, he is supposedly being ordained in Rome. The ALUMNUS regrets that although the first letter is correct, a grem­lin changed the type-head on the second. This second letter should have read from FATHER WILLIAM BEMNGTON, uho was recently ordained in Rome.

5 YEAR REUNION 
JUNE 6-7^8 
Sam Adelo, Secretary 818 Thomas St. South Bend, Ind. 

As you read this I hope you are also packing vour bags in preparation for your return to the campus and our FIVE YEAR REUNION. The plans on this end of the line arc all set with golf tournaments, refreshments, dinners, etc., all arranged. Now wc (myself and the Local Re­union Committee) await you. We have a special added attraction to announce. Tliat is. that \ve have reserved the new private party room and many, many orders of their famous Friday spaghetti at Sunny Italy Cafe (Rosie's to you). Wc think that is still the popular hangout it was in our time and thought the Class would enjoy that spot best of all. 
I suppose you have been receiving our litera­ture regularly. The final release, the return post­card, was sent a short time ago. Be sure and send it back in to us so wc can make our ar­rangements in accord. Wc arc planning, hoit'cvcr, on quite a few considering the responses wc have received even prior to the mailing of tlie return cards. 
Here are excerpts from a few of these letters from our classmates. Maybe they are from some of your special friends. You can sec 'em in per­son if you too come back here on June 6, 7, and 8. 
From MIKE YARBENET, 3018 Evanston Ave., Erie, Pa.: "Dropping you a note to tell you to enter my rcscn'ation for the 5-Year Reunion. "JOE DUCATO expects to drive with mc if at all possible. 
"The schedule you mentioned in your letter sounds interesting—it'll be good to sec all the boys again." 
From BILL WEBB, 951 Castro St., Albanv, Calif.: 
"I was vcr>* glad to receive your letter ad­\-ising me of the plans for the Five-Year Reunion. Sorry to say I will be unable to attend, due to distance, etc, I want to wish you success in handling the reunion, and hope you all have a fine time." 
Sorry you can't make it, Bill, but thanks for your well wishing. It'll be a great success if we get the response we are planning on. 
From DR. TOM SN'YDER (1st Lt. USAF-MC), Base Hospital, Donaldson A. F. B., Green­ville, S. C : 
"At the time of the festivities I will be in Texas, so guess maybe I'll have to wait for the lO-year job to roll around. 
"My brother BOB SNYDER, now an aero­
engineer in Wichita, may be able to go. "Hope all you gents have a good time." How about it. Bob? From JIM SHERIDAN, 46 Wakefield Ave., 
Port Washington, N. Y.: 
"Just finished the latest issue of the ALUM­NUS and the thought came to me that it has been some time since I actually placed the stamp on the letter to our Class Secretary. Because of various reasons letters have been started but never completed. 
"Since our 5th year reunion is only a short two months away, and since we all want it to be a success, any news and suggestions you receive are bound to have an effect on the turnout. JACK DILLON (must put him first since we arc using his car), JOE DITTRICH, CHARLEY KOEGLER, JOHN DUNLEAXT and myself are already planning where to stow the golf bags. Others, namely JIM ATKINSON, KEVIN CAR­LEY, GEORGE CONWAY and AL SANTAN­GELO are busy making arrangements too. For many of us it will be the first trip back to Notre Dame since graduation; needless to say we are looking forward to it. 
"The other day I received a phone call from TOM 5CHREIBER (Bond St. Extended, West­minister, Md.) now associated with Newman Book publishers. He had a two-hour layover in New York City and spent most of the time in a phone booth at Grand Central Station. When I asked him whether he intended to make the reunion he sounded doubtful because until then he had no idea that so many of his good friends are going. .As he put it and as no doubt others of the class must feel, the reunion could be a dud if one goes to it alone. Perhaps, and you are the boy to do it, a Jisi of all those wJio Iiave thus far indicated their intentions to be at XD in June will provide the push necessary* for those sitting on the fence. 
"Since opening my own real estate office last May I have found that the first year is the toughest in more ways than one. My time is so limited that even the monthly meeting of the \fetropolitan Club is difficult to attend regularly. Consequently, as you can see from the above my news coverage is confined to happenings between home and office. 
"You arc doing a great job Sam. See you in June." From DON McGRATH, 615 Broad St., St. Joseph. Mich.: 
"Unless something ver\- unforeseen occurs [ expect to attend the CIxss Reunion over most of the three days. You may treat this as a reser\ation for any class doings wi:h the excep­tion of the overnight accommodations. It is only a short drive from here, and I will check in here at the office daily to attend to any pressing business. 
"My Dad's Class is holding its fortieth Reunion this year so you can see it will be an interesting reunion year." 
From REV. UILLIA^f HAMILTON, St. Mary^s Seminar^*, LaPorte, Texas: 
"I'm writing to you to }et yon knou-that I'm planning on making the class reunion in June. Would appreciate hearing more about it though. 
"I'd like you to mention in the column that I'm being ordained on May 22 and would surely appreciate all the prayers tliat you can scrape together. 
"f sure appreciate getting the ALU^^.^'US. It sort of fills a vacant place to read about alt the fellows I used to know and find out how they all are coming along. 
"That's about all for now. Remember me in your prayers." 
It looks like we have a Class Chaplain. Be sure you make it now. Father, and congratula­tions from the entire class. 
From JIM MURPHY, 5703 E. Washington St.. Apt. 29, Indianapolis 19, Ind.: 
*I shall be happy to ser\'e, as your Indianap­olis area representative to promote attendance at our class reunion June 6. 7. 8. I p}an to write all the fellows on my list and then follow up with phone calls as the time for our get-together approaches. 
"I am going to suggest to the Indianapolis lads that groups of four or five drive to the campus together. This could effect quite a saving, espe­cially among the boys who live even farther away. I am sure that the expense involved in attending the reunion is much more of a factor 
for the 5-year alumni than say the ten, fifteen 
or twenty-five year class. Hence my dwelling on 
the subject. 
"It might be a good idea, too, to urge the 
lads to contact members of their own gang— 
maybe four or five fellows who ran around to­
gether at school. Often, they arc widely dis­
persed rather than in the same city. For example, 
I plan to get in touch with fellows in Lafayette, 
Ind., Long Island, Washington, O. C , California, 
et cetera. 
"I'll be waiting to hear from you on this 
and will get out a personal letter to the Indian­
apolis lads of '47 immediately thereafter. 
"Be looking forward to seeing you in June." 
And here is a copy of Jim's letter that he 
sent out: 
"June 6, 7, 8 promises to be a memorable 
weekend for members of Notre Dame's Class of 
1947. From coast-to-coast they will converge on 
the campus of Our Lady for their five-year re­
union. .At the suggestion of reunion chairman 
SAM ADELO, I am writing members of the 
Class of '47 in this area to be sure that there 
is a good Hoosier representation £tt the first of 
our five-year get-togethers. 
"I am told that a registration fee of approxi­
mately six dollars will cover the Saturday night 
alumni banquet and our housing in Alumni Hall. 
(FATHER GLUECKERT will NOT patrol the 
corridors!) In addition, there will be a Glass 
of '47 dinner on Friday evening and, perhaps, 
a Saturday luncheon. 
"The familiar sights and sounds—breakfast in 
the Caf, a walk around the lakes, renewing 
campus friendships, golf and tennis, a visit to 
the Grotto—will remind us alt of those wonderful 
years when we trod tlie paths at Notre Dame. 
Then there will be several new buildings to in­
spect: the Morris Inn, the Science Hall, and 
others. 
"The Saturday night banquet in the Dining 
Hall will round out a full day. but it will be 
only the beginning of a night of reminiscence and 
fun. Sunday Mass at Sacred Heart Church— 
with the class of '47 and other alumni who now 
have grandsons on campus—will complete a week­
end to be remembered. 
"Make your plans NOW to be at Notre Dame 
on June 6. 7. 8. Why not get together with 
three or four other fellows and drive to the 
campus togetlier? By leaving work a couple of 
hours early (this reunion happens only once every 
five years!) you can easily arrive on campus in 
time for our Class Dinner Friday evening. 
"Before long you will be asked to sign a card 
indicating if you w-ill be able to attend the 
reunion. Make the necessary* arrangements (at 
work and at home) NOW so you can check YES. 
"See you in front of .Alumni that Friday eve­
ning. Don't forget." 
Here is some regular news that came in to 
report to you.

^'Exaras ended on April 29 and on May 2 I'll be an Ensign. It was a long, hard fight. Ma. but I won!! 
"I've lived through a whole new life, learned a new language and a way of doing things for four months. I worked as I never have before and I've learned more in lour months than 1 believed possible. It's been a great experience and I can really appreciate the guy's plight in *Cain Mutiney'. Now that it's aver Vm glad I went through it. but for a while I wondered how I ever got into such a mess. However, the future looks ver\" good. 
^'I'm going to be kept here for another month. We're to be trained on an eighty-three foot patrol craft that's here on the river. Then fifteen of us are to be given commands. I should know where I am going to get my ship in three weeks."

On April 29. from BUDDY POWERS, 5 West 63rd St., Rm. 1203. New York 23, N. Y.: 
'"Been meaning to write much sooner but some­how never got around to it. KEN THOREN suggested I send along some news about our Easter week-end which may be of some use for the next issue of the ALUM.NUS. So 
".\s you know the Glee Club spent four days at the Biltmore. from Holy Thursday until Easter Monday. Some of last year*s troops who managed to get into town for the occasion came from miles around. GERRY KERNS got in from the Coast Guard Academy (New London. Conn.) JOHN BRODERICK also got in. only having been in the Na\-y for a week. Told us *fleetmen' had 'squar«-knotted' his tie and it had remained that' w*ay for a week. (Broderick slipping it loose enough each night to gel il over his head). At that Kerns pulled it loose and it took some doings for John to get things 'ship shape' again. Broderick is up at Providence for eight weeks then lic'IJ be sent to Bayonne for 22 weeks. JACK HARFORD came in from Pittsburgh where he has just been settled by Prudential. Of course PHIL FINNEGAN came over from Brooklyn for the festivities. So we had the old core from last year's group (Kerns, Broderick, Harford, Finnegan and myself) and I might add my core from *Mr. and Mrs. Broadway.* Two other 'old timers' who joined us were TED TWARDZIK and DICK GUILTINAN. Both are with an ac­counting firm here in N.Y.C. Since CHAZZ SCHUBERT, '52, was around most of the time, you know things were jumping. 
''S'jveral of us spent a couple ol hours at St. Patrick's on Good Friday, listening to Bishop Sheen preach only as he can do il. The Old Brew House and the G.A. heard *free' concerts as only the ND Glee Club can give. Even though the boys had several new songs this year, we managed to get going the ones we were familiar with. I took lime out to accompany CHAZZ SCHUBERT to Eaves Costume Co. to select' some clothes for his musical. The Mgr. remembered me from last year when he cos­tumed our 'Mr. and Mrs. Broadway' and we didn't want the Cliarlestoii costumes again this year. Perhaps another time. While this was going on LEO BRENNAN went hunting for the Taft headquarters lo acquire campaign posters and bal­loons—as he was the Taft ' co-chairman in the Mock Convention at ND. 
''Saturday night it was 'party night' at the Biltmore and each guy tried to out-show the other men with some of New York's prettiest girts. Sunday afternoon saw lite gang of n^ sitting in on the Ed Sullivan rehearsal at CBS Studio 9,678. We were proud of our boys up on the stage. Tuesday night Harford had Finnegan and I over to his house for dinner in Cranford, 
N. J. Then we drove to the concert in Summit. The boys did a splendid job and we were very proud. .Aftenvards, we joined the group at a reception in the Beechwood Hotel where we 'partied* and danced. Mr. Ped.kc asked us to join the group in a selection of songs from last year's tour and it was a fitting climax to the week-end festivities. Wc saw the gang off on the bus, wishing that we too ^might get aboard and finish tlie tour with them. 
"Fathei Sinuinitch got into town over the week-end and I joined him and Father Kenna for dinner and a show on Sunday. It was the first time in over seven years that Father Simonitch and I had gotten together. He was my first Reh'gi'on teacher way back in the Spring of '45. Father Kenna is Chaplain of the N. Y. Notre Dame Club. 
"Had dinner last night with KEN THOREN, DON GROBMYER (who's getting his Masters at NYU in June and then expects a commission in the .Naw). and PHIL FINNEGAN at The Anchor on 57th Street (ground floor of the building in which I work). Then wc were off to help celebrate Universal Notre Dame Night at the N. Y. Athletic Club, There we met many of our former classmates and listened to a splen­did talk by FATHER MAURICE E. POWERS. 
C.S.C. (Colonel, U. S. Chaplain's Corps) 'The Fighting Padre,' who had just returned from 16 months on tlie front lines in Korea. He w-as with General Dean.when he was captured and he related tu detail his own escape during which he ate grass for six days. Father Powers was the only Chaplain connected with the atomic tests at Las Vegas. Nevada, recently and watched the blast in the fox-holes witli the troops just' two and a half miles from the Target Zero. He re­lated a breatlt-taking story of his reaction to man's most destructive weapon. Wc were dumb­founded! Of course there was plenty of beer to be had and we had an enjoyable evening. 
"Some other news of interest. Recently heard from FRANK CROVO who is still at Sampson .\ir Base. He's a Tactical Instructor for Basics at present and hopes to enter the OCS class starling in June. GEORGE WALLACE is being married to Catherine Fox. of the Bronx, in June. George works for American Airlines at La Guar­dia Airport and we get together very frequcntlv. BILL HOSCHEIDT and Man* Anne Mouch an­nounced their engagement on April 19. A letter from Mary Anne states she expected to see Thoren and I in June when she is sent on the road for Proctor and Gamble about that time. Finnegan had dinner witli BOB CLEMENCY and his wife over in Brooklyn last week. 
"I am employed by the National Wholesale Distributors of Christian Brothers (the Catholic Order) Wines and Brandy. We are the sole dis­tributors in the U. S. with our liome office on 57ih St. The name of the firm is Fromm & Sichel. Inc. Our other offices include Chicago and San Francisco. I spend most of my day on the pliones talking to our N. Y. salesmen and retail cus omers. We employ some seventy per­sons in our office alone. My boss is a Notre Dame graduate from the class of '29. The work I do is excellent for the training I received in Speecli at ND. Twice a week I am studying dancing with one of New York's outstanding teachers. In tlic Fall I hope to begin work on my Masters at Columbia University in Speech and Radio and Television. 
"Just this afternoon, I received uord from PHIL FINNEGAN that he is being discharged tomorrow from ilie Na\y. With our dinner to­morrow evening it will be the close of a very-pleasant relationship we've enjoyed while he has been stationed f4)r some three months in Brook­lyn. He plans on returning home on Friday. 
"Friday I am leaving for Baltimore where I will attend BOB WILLIAMS* wedding and re­ception on Saturday • morning (May 3). He is marrying Maria Anita Galvin from Baltimore. Expect to sec many old friends and have a real reunion. .Afterwards, JACK LANDRY and I are planning to drive down to Richmond for the rest of the week-end." 
From HAL WILLIAMS, '38. brother of Bob: 
"I've turned 'society* reporter. Here are a few-facts on Bob's wedding if you have space in the back of the ALUMNUS. 
'*Miss Maria Anita Galvin, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. John P. Galvin, of Baltimore, was married May 3 at St. Mary's Church, Baltimore, 
to Robert Allen Williams, '51, son of Mr. and 
Mrs. Harold A. Williams, of Baltimore. 
"Miss Mary Agnes Galvin ' was her sister's maid of honor. HAROLD A. WILLIAMS, JR., '38, was his brother's best man. Ushers included JEROME GROOM, of Des Moines, MARTIN R. O'CONNOR, of Notre Dame, and GERALD WOMBACHER. 
"The couple was married by the Very Rev. Henry J. Schmitt, of Racine, Wis., an uncle of the bridegroom, and the nuptial Mass was ccle­brated by the Very Rev. Reynold Hillenbrand, of Hubbarfls Woods, 111., a cousin of the bride­groom. ANTHONY DONADIO (I forget the year he graduated from Notre Dame), of Balti­more, was vocaJut. 
"Bob and Anita went to Nassau on their wed­ding trip. They will reside in Baltimore until June and In the Fall will make their home In Chicago."
