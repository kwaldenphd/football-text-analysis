AltUH4U lleluf4J0444. R44Ueti4t 
: BY KEV. JOHN P. LYNCH, CS.C, '25: 
To the Boys in Service: 
The Old Padre -wants to make this Bulletin primarily for the boys in ser­vice of whom he knows so many and 
intimately. 
I've received so many letters from you that I can't quite an­swer them all promptly. I'd like this, therefore, to be a personal note to all of you, wherever you are, as personal 
Father Lynch as over the desk 

in 117 Dillon or down at the Grotto or over a cup of coffee in the "caf." 
Many write to me at N.D. (thinking I'm still there), and some have kidded me for letting Dooley and Armstrong run the above picture of me taken about ten years ago. I'm too busy to have a new picture, and besides, I'm ten (or more) years younger in spirit, due to rest after an illness. 
One morning at Notre Dame in 1942 I woke up with one lung flatter than a punctured balloon, and was assigned to less exhausting work as chaplain to the Medical Mission Sisters, 8400 Pine Road, Philadelphia 11. They are missionary nuns training to be doctors and nurses, who one day will go all over the world— India, Africa, China, the South Pacific— after you've come home. 
Anyway, here I am, with the old blow­er all healed and pumped tp and my greatest regret is that I can't be in the service with "my boys" with whom, as it were, I grew up in the priesthood. I can't be with you as a chaplain because the medical history of my One Bum Lung forecloses acceptance by the Army or Navy. 
CHRIST KNOWS SERVICE LIFE 

But I can help even from here with prayers to Him who fought for you and endured misery, absence from home, loneliness, mental and physical anguish and pain; to her whose eyes are not limited to the Dome's Indiana horizon, and who watches over her sons as, a sleepless mother, night and day, as they suffer and endure much as her Son suf­fered and endured. 
That Son in a sense left Home, a glor­ious, happy Home and taking on human nature volunteered to fight for someone else—for us—to protect and deliver us from the slavery of sin, from the tyr­anny of the devil on this earth and from eternal torment after. 
He left that Home for 33 years, be­cause He loved His Father and us. His brothers, so much. . 
He was willing to fight for us. He was willing to suffer for us. He was willing 
Spiritual Benefits 

At the lecent meeting in Cleve|cm(L the alumni directors asked me to outline the spiritual benefits that our alumni and benefactors enjoy at Notre Dame. This I gladly do. They are as follows: 
Every year each priest of the Congre­gation of Holy Cross in the United States offers the Divine Sacrifice at least once for all benefactors, living and dead. 
Daily at the evening prayer exercise, a special petition is offered to God by the respective communities assembled, not only in the religious houses on the com-pus, but throughout the United States. 
Prayers of both faculty and students are offered for deceased members of the alumni as well as their dear ones. 
On request, prayers ore said for spe­cial intentions of alumru. 
For more than a year Mass has been offered daily for men in the armed forces. 
The president and a number of other priests make it a practice to offer the Divine Sacrifice for our valiant sons iriie have been killed. 
At the special hour of adoration on Sun­day, the Congregation is mindful ol all benefactors, living and dead, including alumni and students. 
At frequent intervals throughout the year, in keeping with the tradition ol the president's office, I offer Mass for alumni and benefactors. 
Hence, you can see there is a rich Sfnr­itual treasury in which you share. It is the strongest possible bond between the priests and religious of Holy Cross and the alumni and students. 
to die for us. His death for us would earn freedom and grace. 
And grace, the title to eternal life, would bring the unconquerable assur­ance that after our fight on this earth was over, we'd go Home, to that same glorious, eternal Home of perpetual peace and happiness with God and with those we love. 
His fight approached the climax one night in the Garden of Gethsemane. He knelt there terrifyingly alone. 

HE KNEW FEAR With His divine vision and foresight. He looked down through the ages. He could see every sin of every man, every one of them. He could see every bit of ingratitude and betrayal, by those He was fighting for. They'd go on strike; they wouldn't back Him up. They'd carouse; they'd take His suffering for granted. Oh, at times they'd thank Him maybe, but in­frequently and grudgingly. They'd stare at Him blankly when He asked, not a favor, but just a decent break, a decent return in justice—no favor, mind you, just a decent break. They just wouldn't understand or appre­
ciate what He went through—or if they did, they wouldn't seem to give a dam. A lot of thoughts go through your 
mind when you're alone and suffering and fearful—and He was afraid and wavered as His own words testify. He asked His Apostles to watch with Him one hour, just one hour, but they rolled over—for another sleep. Even those closest to Hini, they couldn't understand 
or appreciate. You who have gone through much of what He did, you'll understand and ap­preciate what He felt. 
WAS IT WORTHWHILE? 

Was He being a "sucker?" Was it worthwhile? The very ones He was fight­ing for and suffering for would neglect Him, betray Him, let Him down, sin, and make it harder for Him. 
He foresaw, not vaguely but in detail, not doubtfully but certainly, everything He had to go through, go through when He could have escaped it all. 
Seizure by His enemies. Insult by His enemies, torture, torture the whole night through, scourging every inch of His Body. And thirst, so like the American boys taken prisoner on Ba­taan. Blows in the face, spit in the face. Finally His Cross. He'd carry it stumb­ling, blinded with blood and spittle. Then death, and not a quick, honorable merci­ful death, but a slow, agonizing death, amid ridicule and jeers. (Continued on Page 6)

Notre Dame, Summer of 1944 
Being a Little Someih'mg of Everything of In­
NAVY ENBOLMENT CUT 40 PEB CENT 
That's the Number One Item of the Summer, because it has in it a slight tinge of optimism on the war. But it also has in it a warning that with Zahm and Cavanaugh Halls being returned to civ­ilian use in November, Notre Dame and Notre Dame alumni had better be alive to restore the full civilian population without the handicaps of a transition period of seriously curtailed civilian en­rolment. 
Announced in mid-July by Rear Ad­miral L. E. Denfeld, this reduction of 40 per cent in the V-12 enrolment will in no way affect the United States Midship­men's School. Commenting on Rear Ad­miral Denfeld's announcement, Rev. Hugh O'Donnell, Q.S.C., president' of Notre Dame, said: 
"This new program shows a thought­fulness that we have always found char-­acteristic of the Nayy- I" commending the University on its gracious and effect­ive cooperation since Pearl Harbor, the Bureau of Navy Personnel points out that the nation wide reduction in the V-12 program naturally affects the larg­er quotas, because of the Navy's desire to help the smaller colleges continue for the duration. 
"News of the reduction," said Father O'Donnell, "will be welcomed by boys under eighteen, in the last semester of high school, who planned to enter Notre Dame, but whom we could not have ac­commodated while our facilities were so severely taxed. Since the Navy will not require Zahm and Cavanaugh Halls after Nov. 1, facilities for civilian stu­dents will be almost doubled, and we can begin our reconversion program to pro­vide not only for civilians but also for those veterans who have already ex­pressed a wish to return to college. The 

terest, To Save Time, Paper and Delay; Don't Skip It, If You Want to Know the Answers. 
that Notre Dame has retained through­out all its cooperation in the war effort." 
ENBOLMENT THIS SUMMEB The summer semester began its 16­week period on July 5 with 1,728 V-12 enroUees (seamen, marines and N. R. O. 
T. C) , 684 civilian undergraduate stu­dents, and 33 graduate students. 
Release of Zahm and Cavanaugh Halls in November will permit an increase of several hundred civilian students. Alum­ni interest in contacting young men in­terested in entering college now will be of course appreciated. With many boys under 18 able to get in a year or more of college before draft call, with a slow­ing up of the urgency of the draft quotas, and with many discharged vet­erans eligible for the educational bene­fits of the GI Bill and the rehabilitation program, enrolment will soon again, it is believed, be a matter of selection with the University's ceiling of 3,000. Boys able to enter now can be well advised to do so. 
BOABO MEETING IN CLEVELAND 
Outstanding tiom alumni interpreta' tions was the summer meeting of the Board of Directors of the Association in Cleveland. President Thomas F. Byrne, '28, and Director Rev. M. L. Moriarty, '10, acted as hosts. Rev, Hugh O'Donnell, C.S.C, '16, honorary, president, vice-president E. B. Bailey, '22, director John Balfe, '20, W. R. Dooley, '26, and J. E. Armstrong, '25, attended. 
Placement, about which Bill Dooley writes elsewhere in this issue, was the most concrete subject discussed. Your . cooperation in working out the program will be necessary as well as appreciated. 
The Fond, about which more in a few paragraphs, was discussed. 
The ALUMNUS was confirmed as pres­ently handled (see back cover).

SECOND ANNUAL ALUMNI FUND 

The detailed report of new contribu­tors and totals appears elsewhere in this. issue. 
The Second Annual Fund closes on Dec 31. If it has not matched the Cen­tenary Fund in amount, and exceeded it in participation of alumni, it will be helpful to the. University (as it already is) but a failure in the light of its ob­jectives. 
There has been an over-all trend to increase the individual contributions (in spite of the apparent lower per capita gift, which is caused by the absence of several of the Centenary Fund's special large gifts). 
But participation, which is after all more the mark of interest and support than total amount, is still dragg^g. Last year's total was only 33 per cent of our total alumni, a rather low figure as Notre Dame spirit is generally accepted. 
This year, at the end actually of a calendar year of opportunity (though the Fund will continue to Dec. 31 to effect the shift of the Association's fiscal year to the calendar year) participiation is only 20 per cent. 
And don't say "Men in Service," be­cause they have g^ven as generously, in numbers and in amount, as any others. 
Within the next four months, during which time you will have many occasions to modestly share Notre Dame's glory, we should double the number of contrib­utors, and, if possible, double the amount already contributed. One "WAR BOND PEE CONTRIBUTOR WOULD DO IT! 
COMMENCEMENT 

The Jtme ALUMNUS printed Father Thomas Brennan's excellent commence­ment address to the graduates on June 
23. At the exercises, 149 were gradu­ated. An outstanding valedictory address was delivered by Joreph H. Murnane of Chicago. Degrees were announced by the several deans, and presented by the Rev. 
J. Hugh O'Donnell, C.S.C. Cap and go\vn again shared honors with uniforms of the various services, and neither war nor its dictated modifications of program can remove the impressiveness that goes 
• with these ceremonies. 
NEW SEMESTEB Little time is lost in the present 48­week school year. Painters, plumbers, janitors, electricians, window - washers. 
and all the extensive machinery of main­
tenance were sandwiched in (with many 
omissions) between commencement, and 
the influx of new and returning students 
on July 3. Brownson study hall is now 
a set of temporary offices (which look 
good, if diiferent). Carroll still holds out 
as throne room and study hall for a 
goodly detachment of boys who look at 
its facilities in wonder the first week 
(and many of whom won't leave it later 
when they get a chance). 
Two new faculty members came in with the July semester. One is not new to Notre Dame, George DriscoU, '25, Chillicothe, O. George has been a high­way and city engineer, and a representa­tive in the NRA of the crushed stone, sand and gravel industry, and came to the Civil Engineering Department here from the Southern Ohio Quarry Co., a highway construction business. The oth­er faculty member is Dr. Harold C. Per­kins, history, on leave from Bradley In­stitute. Dr. Perkins is a Ph.D. from Yale and taught at the University of Pitts­burgh before going to Bradley. He is a specialist in the Civil War period of American history, 
OBEDIENCES 

Because of war conditions, the pro­vincial chapter of the Congregation of Holy Cross, ordinarily held in this year, was postponed. Pew obediences were is­sued by the Provincial, Rev. Thomas A. Steiner, C.S.C, '99, which affect serious­ly the organization of the various pro­grams of the Congregation in the United States province. 
Among those of personal interest to many alumni are these: Rev. John M. Ryan, made assistant superior at the Community House and a member of the Local Council, Notre Dame; Rev. John 
P. Lynch, ALUMNUS columnist, brought to Holy Cross Seminary, Notre Dame, from Philadelphia; Rev. Charles E. Sheedy, assistant prefect of religion, moved East to work for his S.T.D.; Rev. Louis Thornton, just ordained, sent to the Military Ordinariate to assist Most Rev. John F. O'Hara, C.S.C; Rev. Wil­liam A. Bolger, assigned to St. Mary's College as assistant chaplain; Rev. Wil­liam Lennartz made assistant to Rev. Patrick Dolan at St. Patrick's in South Bend; Rev. Philip Schaerf assigned to teach at Portland. 
Brother Alan, for many years in Brownson Hall, and recently canvasser for The Ave Maria, has been assigned ae Corby Hall porter to succeed Brother Aloysius, who has been retired to the Community Infirmary. Corby, you will recall, is now the residence of many of the priests directly associated with the University. 
Brothers of the Congregation will op­erate two new schools this fall. They will be St. Thomas Aquinas School, Brooklyn, New York, and Catholic Central High School, Monroe, Mich. 
Going to Brooklyn are Brothers Ve­nard, Nevin, Maunis, Armel, Ellis and Germain; to Monroe, Brothers Christian, Remigius and Gerontius. Brother Venard will be superior and principal of the Brooklyn school. 
St. EDWARD'S MILITARY ACADEMY 
Notre Dame alumni have always had an interest in and a fraternal regard for the fortunes of St. Edward's Uni­versity, in Austin, Texas. Founded in 1871 by Notre Dame's own founder. Rev. Edward Sorin, C.S.C, the "Notre Dame of the Southwest" has not en­joyed always the same felicitous history of the University of Notre Dame. In a more sparsely populated and less Cath­olic area, the impacts of wars and de­pressions have prevented a constant development. 
So that Notre Dame men will welcome the news of the most recent program of St. Edward's. After two years of trial, St. Edward's Military Academy has become a permanent part of the University in Austin. Already affiliated with the Texas State Guard, and the only Catholic institution which has a Training and Research Unit, the school is anticipating a 55c rating from the federal government, which should lead to the establishment of an ROTC unit after the war. 

Rev. William Robinson, C.S.C, '20, president of St. Edward's, has outlined for the Military Academy the same edu­cational objectives, based on sound religious training, that have always been the basis of education by the Con­gregation of Holy Cross. 
The school occupies a 500-acre campus on a height overlooking the city of Austin. Collegiate work in arts, science, engineering and commerce has been offered in the various stages of the University's development. 
-Rev. Joseph Houser, C.S.C, '31, is vice-president of St, Edward's new military program. Rev. James Gibbons, C.S.C, '29, is commandant of the Academy, and Rev. Thomas Jones, C.S.C, '31, is adjutant and director of studies. Joseph E. Cassidy, Captain TE!X, is executive officer. 
For interested alumni, a catalog will be sent on request to Father Robinson. The Fall term opens on Sept. 9, 1944.

Questionaire Mailed to N. D. Service Men 
Marking the first important step in the program of the Alumni Association to aid returning Notre Dame war vet­erans, a vocational questionnaire, formu­lated by the Vocational Committee of the Association, was recently mailed to each of about 5,000 Notre Dame men known by the Alumni Ofiice to be in the armed forces. 
The questionnaire was included with the latest issue of the letter which Father O'Donnell, president of the Uni­versity, periodically sends to each Notre Dame man in service. Father O'Donnell's letter was this time devoted, in large measure, to an explanation of the ques­tionnaire and of what, it is hoped, will be accomplished by it. 
(Those servicemen ivho do not, for any reason, receive a copy of this ques­tionnaire can easily obtain one by writ­ing a postcard to the Alumni Office). 
The objectives of the questionnaire are two: to provide the basic informa­tion necessary to set up any sort of program for aiding Notre Dame veter­ans in their search for jobs; and to give the University some idea of the number of Notre Dame men in the armed forces who will be returning to the campus to continue their education. 
It is, of course, obvious that neither the Alumni Association nor the Univer­sity can plan adequately in these two fields until' they have a comprehensive notion of the scope of the jobs facing them. The first part of the questionnaire is, therefore, designed merely to find out, in approximate numbers, how many service men will be wanting in the post­war period whatever vocational assist­ance may be available to them throng the Alumni Association, and how many will be returning to school. 
The second, and much larger, part of the questionnaire is to be filled out by those who indicate in the first part that they wish to have any available voca­tional assistance through the Alumni Association. Asked for in this part is the background information usual in such cases: schooling, job experience, job desires, etc. Such information will be kept on file in the Alumni OfBce for. future use. 

Marls First Big Step ii» Program of Alumni Association to Help Veterans; Wi l Also Assist University in Post-War Planning. 
It is emphasized, both in Father O'Donnell's letter and on the question­naire, that the present mailing is mostly in the nature of a prelimiiuiry survey. Actual plans for aiding Notre Dame veterans will be made largely on the basis of data gathered from returned questionnaires. 
The Vocational Committee of the Alumni Association is headed by Ber­nard J. Voll, '17, South Bend, president of the Sibley Machine and Foundry Corp. Mr. Voll is a lay trustee of the University, is a past president of both the Notre Dame Club of the St. Joseph Valley and of the national Alumni As­
•sociation and is secretary of the class ' of 1917. A veteran of extensive action in France in World War I, he was later graduated from the Harvard Law School. 
Working with- Mr. Voll on the com­mittee are William C. Schmitt, 10, president, Schmitt Steel Company, Portr land. Ore.; Clyde E. Broussard, 13, secretary and treasurer, Beaumont Sice Mills, Beatunont, Texas; John T. Balfe, '20, insurance executive. New York City; Daniel H. Young, '22, manager. Dry Dock Associates, Philadelphia; Jo­seph F. Donaldson, '23, Director of Safety, city of Louisville, Ky.; Edward 
F. O'Toole, '25, attorney, Chicago; John 
W. Brennan, '27, sales engineer, Ameri­can Blower Corp., Detroit; Clayton 6. Leronx, '27, assistant personnel director, Monarch Aluminum Mfg. Co., Clevdand; John F. McMahon, '28, managing direc­tor. Industrial Hygiene Foundation of America, Inc., Pittsburgh; and William 
K. Dool^, "26, assistant alumni secre­tary, Notre Dame. Mr. Dooley is secre­tary of the committee. 
Members of the committee have car­ried on extensive correspondence with their chairman, oqiressing id^s based, in many instances, upon personal ex­periences in the vocational field' and upon investigations carried on for the committee in the members'- home com­munities. Bill Dooley has traveled to several Middle West colleges to confer with their placement directors, and both he- and Mr, Voll have gathered much data by mail from schools, industries, trade assodations and government agencies. The plans of government agoides for aiding veterans have been carefully considered. 
On the basis of all this activity, it was decided that the mailing of the qnes-. tionnaire was logically the first step in the committee's program. When the qnestionnairea are returned and tabu­lated, a tentative program of operation will be set up and presented for ap­proval to the committee, at a meeting to be held in the falL

LL CoL Francis S. Gabreski 

that he will, like so many others reported to be "missing," find his way to safety, if he hasn't already done so. 
As newspapers everywhere have said so generously in story and picture, Frank has been credited with destroying 28 enemy planes in the air and three on the ground, and was about to come back to this country on leave. He has won 16 decorations including the Polish Cross of Valor, the American D.S.C., D.F.C. with seven clusters, the Air Medal with four clusters and the Silver Star. 
Frank is the brother of Major Thad­deus S. Gabreski, '34, a doctor serving in the India theater.

2nd Lt loseph H. Ruetz 

completing flight instruction with spe­cial attainments in line with those of his earlier record. 
Lieutenant Ruetz won the highest reg­imental honor which can be accorded a naval aviation cadet at Corpus Christi, the world's largest naval aviation train­ing center, when he was appointed cadet captain on the staff of the regiment. The captain of the cadets is selected for that high post on the basis of scholastic standing,. .personality, and qualities of leadership. 
Joe also served as president of the board of governors of the aviation cadet recreation mess, a cadet governing body which plays a prominent role in regi­mental activity. 
Prior to service at Corpus Christi, Joe was captain of the naval aviation cadets at Norman, Okla., primary training sta­tion. Coming up the hard way, he served as platoon leader at Del Monte, Calif., naval pre-flight school. 
While working toward a doctor's de­gree in anthropology at the University of California, he coached football at nearby St. Mary's College. Again rolling up a cum laude average, he lacked only one semester toward his Ph.D. degree when he enter naval service. Commis­sioned an ensign in May, 1942, he was assigned temporary duty at San Fran­cisco. 
Then came nine months duty as an athletic oflicer at St. Mary's Naval Pre-Flight School—^where, by coincidence, he instructed several aviation cadets who were later to be his instructors at Corpus Christi. A football star at St. Mary's Pre-Flight, he was selected as guard on the All-Service team in 1942. 
In March, 1943, Lieutenant Huetz re­
signed his commission to start his navy 
career all over again as an aviation 
cadet. 


ALUMNI RELIGIOUS BULLETIN 
(Continued from page 2) 
HE UNDEBSTANDS He saw all this—and wondered wheth­er it was worthwhile. You men in the service who have faced fear, pain, absence from home, loneli­ness, feelings of betrayal, feelings that it wasn't worthwhile, you can imder­stand. 
You can understand why He can un­derstand you. 
You above all can understand why the Sacred Heart asks today for gratitude and reparation for our own sins and others—why He asks for loyalty and love. The Sacred Heart isn't necessarily and exclusively the beautiful Person you see in pictures, asking for love and repa­ration. He is also the suffering, lonely, agonizing Christ in the Agony in the Garden, sweating it out, in very blood. 
The Sacred Heart is the suffering Christ too, asking for gratitude, repara­tion, appreciation, love, as outlined in the Holy Father's Encyclical on the Sacred Heart. 
THE GARDEN'S BLOODY SWEAT—AND YOU 
You today can offer up your sufferings to Him in union with His sufferings back in the Garden—and as He then saw all those sins and injustices of the future. He fortunately could see then also all your patient sufferings for Him and mth Him today. 

So you today, in your sufferings, can be with Him back in that Garden, kneel­ing in spirit and in sympathy with Him. You today can be a source of comfort, strength and solace to Him, if you offer up your sufferings to Him, for Him and with Him in reparation, loyalty and love. 
Offer Ihem in the Mass and in- the Morning Offering. He above all can ap­preciate everjrthing you face and endure. 
Offer your "work, prayers and suffer­ings" to Him and with Him and for Him, in a very personal and real union with Him in the Garden and you'll hear Him answer, "I know how you fieel. I under­stand. It is worthwhile for that eternal Home and those we love. And for that Home we'll carry on. We'll face this— together." 
That's keeping the Faith—and living it—and living Christ.

Death robbed Orestes Brownson, who has been called the "Father of American philosophy," of his ambition to teach at the University of Notre Dame when it claimed him in 1876 while he was en-route to the campus, but thanks to the United States Navy, his great-great­grandson. Apprentice Seaman Clarence 
E. Brownson, of Des Moines, became a Notre Dame man. 
Seaman Brownson had to battle off blindness three times to achieve his am-' bition. He came to the University after seeing active duty in both the Atlantic and Pacific waters. When afforded the chance of enlisting in a V-12 school, Seaman Brownson lost no time in pick­ing Notre Dame, where his famous fore­

The Scholastic now boasts eight columnists. Rev. Charles Carey, C.S.C, continues as faculty advisor. Publications offices have moved into the new offices in the former Brownson study hall. 

K. OF C. ACTIVE 
A pre-war K. of C. picnic was held on July 30 to keep alive the tiraditions and stimulate the membership drive. Grand Knight is' Timothy Cotter of San Francisco. The financial secretary, Ernie Howard, has established offices in the new Brownson Hall executive offices, leaving the old Walsh Hall suite to the Navy. 
LAWBAU Outstanding for' carrying on in the face of a veritable blitzkri^ is the Col­lege of Law. In addition to surviving acadonically, on August 18 the Law Ball is booked, with Lew Diamond playing the program. Other dance activities for civilians have been sponsored during the summer sonester, as daring previous se­mesters, by the Co-Hop organization. 
WAB BOMD SALES In addition to the stimulus of. war bond purchase among alumni for the Second Annual Fund, and the high cam­pus sale through the agency of the Navy enrollees, tog^ether with the University's own purchases for the limited investment portfolio of the endowment, Notre Dame's lay faculty added to the out­standing record of St. Joseph County by oversnbscribinig the Fifth War Loan quota. The result was announced by Paul C. Bartholomew, head of-the De­partment of Politics and president of the Lay Faculty Club. 
NJ>. CHEIOSTS MEET Notre Dame chemistry alumni, attend­ing the American Chemical Society fall meeting in New York City, Sept. 11-15, will, it is planned now, meet at a special 
N.D. dinner sponsored by the New York Club after the pattern set in Cleveland in April. Details will appear in chemical journals and in the convention literature, or can be secured at the Hotel Commo­dore headquarters of the N. Y. Club. 
DEANMAMION July 9 and 16 the Catholic Hour, spon­sored by the N.C.C.M., featured addres­ses by Dean Clarence E. Manion of the University's Collie of Law. Alumni may secure copies of Dean Manion's out­standing addresses by writing to the Alwnni Office. The limited supply of the 
N.C.C.M. seems to have been exhausted even before this issue reaches you. Dean Manion's addresses are so fundamental to America and to Catholic principle, that the Alumni Association is ordering reprints. 
BANDCONCERTS The University Band is giving during the summer a series of Wednesday eve­ning concert on the Main Quadrangle. Composed in large part of V-12 men, these concerts share interest with the noon-day concerts which accompany the meal-time marches of the various units and which attract not only the civilians and the employes of the University to the quadrangle, but which are attracting numbers of South Bend citizois.

Col. Jock Henebry "Comes Home" 
By JAMES W. SCHAEFFER. '46 
A low-flying homing pigeon came back to his old roost Monday at the Univer­sity of Notre Dame—a bird who carried spitting guns in its beak, carted high explosive in its talons and wore the sil­ver wings of an eagle on his shoulder— a bird of prey which has spelled disaster for the Japs in the Southwest Pacific area for the last two years. 
Col. "Jock" Henebry returned to the campus he left four years ago this month to join the army air corps. He left a new college graduate about to start in at the bottom of the ladder as a green air cadet. He came back as "the king of the Southwest Pacific attack bomber pilots," a fighting leader of an attack unit v^ch has accounted for a good section of Hirohito's armed forces, and liis chest laden with decorations. 
Col. John Phillip Henebry, son of Mr. and Mrs. J. A. Henebry, of Plainfield, ni., is his official title, but to his multi­tude of friends on the campus he is "Jock." His fame is international. When any newspaper account mentioned the Japs being blasted "down under" it usually could be presumed that some­where around was Jock and his "Grim Reaper" attack unit. He is still as mod­
• est as ever—^and with a wide friendly grin that's a pleasure to see. 
Sitting in Sorin Hall where he once roomed, the 26-year-old Col. Henebry said, "It seems wonderful to be back home. It's the same as it ever was, ex­cept the fellows you once knew aren't around any more." One of Col. Henebiy's contonporaries at the university was Lieut. Col. Francis S. Gabreski, ex '42, America's leading fighter pilot, with 28 planes to his credit in the European theater. {Col. Gabreski lias since been listed as "missing in action"). 
His visits at aircraft factories throughout the country since his return assured him that the home front work­ers "aren't lying down on the job but are working their hardest to produce the materials for victory." He reluctantly admitted that there seem to be some "who don't know there is a war going on and don't seem to care." 
His own contributions to the cause of paving the road to Tokyo can best be summed up by listing his decorations. Col. Henebry, with an unofficial record of 15 hits on Jap vessels (ships and planes are credited to the unit as a whole and not to individuals), holds the Distinguished Service Cross, the nation's second highest award for valor. Dis­tinguished Flying Cross with three Oak Leaf Clusters, the Air Medal and one Oak Leaf, the Silver Star, the Purple Heart, the presidential unit citation, the service awards for service in the Pacific area and the American theater of opera­tions, and the pre-Pearl Harbor ribbon. 
His latest medal came only the first of this month. Lieut. Gen. George C. Kenney, allied air force commander for the New Guinea area, presented the D. 
S. C. to Henebry for his bravery in an 
.action fought near Kabaul last Nov. 2. His citation read ".. . in the face of intense and accurate antiaircraft fire . . . flying the entire length of Simpson harbor at an altitude of less than 150 feet, and using 1,000-pound bombs, he scored a direct hit on a medium-sized freighter and a near miss on another. 
"When his bombs were exhausted he strafed a Japanese cruiser whose anti­aircraft fire endangered the success of "his mission. With full knowledge of the peril involved, Henebry deliberately at­tacked the enemy warship in an effort to shield his unit from its withering fire . . ." The colonel silenced the guns of the cruiser with his machine gun fire and brought his badly damaged ship home. 
Henebry's squadron, operating first with B-25 bombers and then with A-20 attack bombers, ran up a score of 600 Jap planes to their credit, 130,000 tons of shipping sunk, and 180,000 damaged during their operations which included the Bismarck sea engagement, where he won the D. F. C, and the recent by-pass­ing move against the Japs in New Guinea. Col. Henebry describes the A-20 plane used by his unit since January of this year as "beautiful, the best at­tack plane we have." His unit specialized in mast-head bombing, different from the publicized "skip-bombing." In mast-head bombing Col. Henebry said, the ship's counter-fire is silenced and then a bomb dropped directly against her.

ATHLETICS 
Notre Dame Wins National Golf Title; Ties in Tennis 
Notre' Dame won unprecedented na­tional honors in both tennis and golf early this summer, tying for highest intercollegiate ranking in tennis and winning the intercollegiate golf tourna­ment. In addition, a Notre Dame man, Charles Samson, played in the finals of the tennis tournament against the re­nowned Francisco "Pancho" Segura. Details of the notable victories follow: 
• TENNIS 
Coach Walter Langford's tennis team, after gaining the right to western su­premacy during the regular spring season, dropped in at the National Inter­collegiate meet at Evanston, 111., June 
Charles Samson 
2 6-July 1, and brought further glory to Notre Dame by copping a share of the team title along with University of Miami (Florida) and Texas. 
Sending a four man team to the event, headed by Capt. Chuck Samson, a V-12 trainee and a transfer from Ohio State, the Irish quartet was able to garner three points, two in the singles event, and one in the doubles. Samson, was denied a "seeded" position when the tourney pairings were an­nounced despite his standout play during the regular card, but he battled of Miami, 6-0, 6-4, 6-0. Segura, present­ly ranked No. 3 in the United States, proved more than Samson could handle. In attaining a spot in the finals, Samson defeated Phil Glotzer of Chicago, Rob­ert Lewis of Utah, Howard McCall of Georgia Tech and the "seeded" No. 3 man, Harry Likas of Gonzaga. 
Jerry Evert, a V-12er and brother of last year's captain, Jimmy Evert, Notre Dame's No. 2 man, was pitted against Harry TuUy of Chicago in his first match, winning handily, 6-0, 6-4. His second tussle with Stan Clark of Cali­fornia Tech was his final try as he lost, 6-1, 7-5. No. 3 man Bill TuUy won his first booking from Elden Yeck of Brad­ley, 6-2, 6-1, but found the Naval Academy touch too much as E. A. Davis of Annapolis eliminated him from play, 7-5, 7-5. The last member in singles play, Jim Griffin, an NROTC trainee, was pitted against Northwesterh's No. 2 man and beat him, 6-1, 5-7, 6-3, but the stoiy saddened from that point on as Nick Buzolich of Pepperdine came through with lop-sided wins, 6-0, 6-1. 
The luck of the Irish did not hold in the draw for the doubles competition as TuUy and Griffin drew the "seeded" No. 2 team, Willett-McCall of Georgia Tech, as their opening opponents, the Tech-men winning, 6-3, 6-2. The pairing of Samson and Evert subdued Crawford-Davis of Annapolis in their initial out­ing and slammed home another win in the quarter-final round over Druliner-Beisser of College of Pacific. Their semi-finals opponent, Hickman-Kelly of Texas, bounced them out of the com­petition, 7-5, 6-2, 6-3, the Longhom duo going on to win the doubles play with a victory over Pepperdine. 
In annexing three tourney points, the Blue and Gold added more prestige to their already established one point toward the Garland Bowl, a trophy presented in 1942 that will go to the first team to attain 25 points. The Irish institution is the only midwestem school that has been able to acquire any" ]^iits toward the trophy; and also Notre Dame has been the only middle-western school that has sent a mail past the quarter­final rounds in the last two years.--''-­
At the outset of the semi-final rounds, Notre Dame was the only team with contestants left both in the doubles and singles events. -• • 
Coach Langford scheduled an in­formal summer session with varioiis town tennis clubs and a few colleges. Among^ the teams booked, are the River Forest Tennis Club, near Chicago,' and Lawrence College, Appleton, Wis., pos­sessors of a strong spring record. Sam-

son. Evert, Tully and Griffin have re­turned under the Navy program and are serving in the first four spots, re­spectively, while Joe Wood, a V-12er and former fleetman, is in the No. 5 position, with Stan Warshawsky and Bart O'Brien battling for No. 6 honors. 
• GOLF The monotony of knocking at the door only never to have it open is no longer a consideration for the Notre Dame golf team, for June 26 brought Rev. George 
L. Holderith, C.S.C, golf coach, and his six man Irish team the national cham­pionship title at the 47th annual inter­collegiate meet in Toledo. 
After going through a regular col­legiate season of seven \s'ins as against a lone loss, to Purdue's Boilermakers, the team combined spirit with steadily improving golf to bring home the big­gest bacon. 
A team total of 311, as against Min­nesota's 312, won for Notre Dame. Michigan was third with 318, while an­other Big Ten entry, Ohio State, was fourth with 327. 
The remainder of the Notre Dame team had already finished and assembled on the last green. Three over par as he readied himself for the 16th tee. Bob Terry, 17-year-old pre-med student from Kewanee, 111., was approached by team­mate Tom Kennedy. Bob contended that he would probably bogey the next three, but Kennedy merely encouraged him to hold his score down. 
Little did Terry actually know how much depended on his ^vinning his match. After bogeying the 16th and 17th, he came through with a par on the 18th. The ball had hardly rolled into the cup before the rest of the Fighting Irish delegation was surrounding Bob and hugging him. 
Then, and only then, did he know what he had actually done—^he had clinched Notre Dame's first intercollegiate vic­tory. 
Despite Notre Dame's regular season triumphs over Michigan and Minnesota by the decisive scores of 17%-19% and 20-7 respectively, the dopesters still poured the publicity on the Wolverines and tried to edge them into the title before they had set foot on the course. In reality, it was the Golden Gophers who offered the stiffest opposition and led right down the home stretch. A photo finish had Notre Dame winning by a single stroke. 
In winning the meet, Notre Dame be­came the second Mid-western school to achieve such an honor. Michigan was the first. Team totals were based on the low four individual scores by each team. 
In addition to Terry's 76, Jim Bessen­felder, the only V-12 trainee on the squad, got a 76, John Fitzpatrick a 77, and Capt. Mel Wilke bagged an 82. 
In the individual matches, Notre Dame qualified six men but all were eliminated early in the playing except freshman Jack Fitzpatrick who went into the second roimd. 
Football Coach Ed McKsever 

FOOTBALL With Frank Leahy on leave of ab­sence from head coaching duties, Ed McKeever has assumed the reins and will guide the 1944 version of the Fight­ing Irish. Head Coach McKeever, being assisted by Hugh Devore, Clem Crowe, Adam Walsh, Walter Ziemba and Jake Kline, has just completed the summer session in which the intricacies of the "T" were put on display. Part of the grooming was entrusted to Eay Nolting, Chicago Bear halfback, who put in four weeks helping the newcomers to fa­miliarize themselves with the "T." 
The array of left-overs is hardly mentionable. In the ball-toting depart­ment, there is Bob Kelly and George Terlep, both scheduled to leave around Nov. 1. Others who were in the lesser ranks last season include Elmer Angs­man, Steve Nemeth, Chick Maggioli, Prank Ruggerio, a converted guard, and IVank Dancewicz. The newer lads that have made the proverbial "good impression" include Joe Gasparella, 17­year-old quarterback sensation, who is being touted as the successor to Angelo Bertelli; Joe Bartos, Don Doody, Nnnzio Marino, Doug Waybright, Rudy Krall, Jim McGurk and Frank Endress. 
On the flanks, there is not a man retiiming, but the looming possibilities are found in Bill O'Connor, Tom Guth­rie, Joe Kelly and Bob Sko^und. With All-American Jim White's shoes to fill at tackle, McKeever will find the most promising candidate in 6*7" John "Tree" Adams, last year's second stringer, who was voted the most im­proved player in the spring drills. There is also very able George Sullivan who understudied White, but the rest of the remaining group of tackles is yet to be picked from Welch, Shuster and^Glaab. 
With the return of Capt. Pat Riley, who was given an honorable discharge from the Marine Corps, the Irish take a turn upward, that is, if his recent knee operation doesn't keep him in the ranks of the spectators. Having been reelected captain by the returning let­termen, he will lead not only the Blue and Gold afield but will, it is hoped, lead the gruards as well. Miezskow, Mike Manzo, Mike Ganey and John Mastran­gelo are inexperienced guard candidates. The pivot position is being contested for among Art Statuto, a squad mem­ber from last year's national champion outfit, Fred Rovai, a retread from full­back, George Martz, and Dick Bern­hardt. 
To predict a lineup of any sort would be foolhardy prognostication at this time as the "down to earth" work will commence in September in preparation for the first game with Pittsburgh, Sept. 30. 
• BASEBALL Jake Kline, unable to break ties with the diamond sport when the weather is ideal, has formed what may well be termed his second "informal summer season." Although no monograms are awarded to the summer players, Jake has rigged up a regular schedule of games, and, as this is written, there have been five wins, two setbacks, and one tie. 
With several of the boys back from the regular spring team which batted an even .500 in 22 contests, plus several additions from new students, the dia­mond boss has been having his usual good time. 
Civilian pitchers Jack Barrett and Paul Lammers have been carrying the brunt of the work, with capable assist­ance from Eldon O'Brien. Frank Cisz­czon, Dick Balbierz and Bob Cianchetti have returned to the infield at third, short and second, respectively, from the spring team, while the new initial sacker is Jack Tree. Vince Laurita is catching and old-timers Jack Mayo and Ken Manarik have clinched garden spots, with ambitious competition from a pair of "greenies," Art Fitzgerald and Jim Karthall.

S. S. Angus McDonald Launched 
A group of the principal'figures at the launching ceremonies of the S.S. Angus McDonold ot Houston. Texas. on-Iuly 12. Left to right H. M. LuU. executiTe vice-president of the Southern Paciiie Lines: Miss Kathleen O'Coimor. employe of the SJ. in Houston, who was maid of honon Mrs. Mory I. McDonald, widow of Angus McDonald; BeT. Vmiiam Robinson. C. S. C„ president of SL Edward's University. Austin. Texas, who' blessed the ship: and Brian Odem. '17. federal district attorney in Houston, who read a message from Bev. Hugh O'Donnell. C. S. C, president of Notre Dame. 
The S. S. Angus McDonald, 10,500­ton Liberty ship, named for the late president of the Southern Pacific lines and a lay trustee of the University, was launched on July 12 at the Todd Hous­ton Shipbuilding corporation, Houston, Texas. Mrs. Angus McDonald, sponsor, was assisted by Miss Kathleen O'Con­nor, of the Southern Pacific Lines of Houston. 
The ship, named in tribute to Mr. Mc­Donald, member of the class of 1900 at Notre Dame, received its title at the recommendation of Postmaster General Frank Walker, '09, also a lay trustee, to the Maritime Commission. Mr. Mc­Donald who played quarterback at Notre Dame, and was four-year mono­gram winner in baseball, turned down a professional baseball career when he went to work as a clerk in the Houston offices of the Southern Pacific and then worked his way up to the presidency of the corporation. 

In 1931 he was recipient of an hon­orary doctorate of laws from the Uni­versity, and served as a member of its board of lay trustees for 10 years prior to his death in November, 1941. In 1915-16 he was president of the Alumni Association. 
A group consisting of Brian Odem, '17, of Houston, United States district attorney; Rev. William Robinson, C.S.C, '20, of St. Edward's University, Austin, Texas, and E. M. Walter, '14, of the Houston Chronicle, in addition to a delegation from the Notre Dame club of Houston, represented the University at the launching ceremonies. Father Robin­son gave the invocation, while Mr. Odem read a statement from Rev. Hugh O'Donnell, C.S.C, president of Notre Dame. The statement follows: 
"As the good ship Angus McDonald leaves the ways and gracefully dips its bow for the first time into the waters of the historic Gulf, the University of Notre Dame, through its official repre­sentatives, sends a special blessing pre­paratory to its sailing the seven seas. Notre Dame also expresses its gratitude to the Maritime Commission and the Houston Shipbuilding Corporation which, at the suggestion of the Honorable Frank C. Walker, Postmaster General of the United States, memorialized the name of one so signally deserving of honor. 
"Angus McDonald was truly an Amer­ican. As he rose to eminence in industrial and business life, as president of the Southern Pacific Company, he not only did not forget his friends, but whenever he could gave them a helping hand along the upward path that he had come—the hard way. When his country called him during World War I, he responded eagerly, serving in the capacity for which his experience and talents ad­mirably fitted him. For almost half a century he was keenly interested in all phases of the life and development of Notre Dame, and his advice and connsd were always at the disposal of his Alma Hater. His school looks upon him as an exemplary Notre Dame man who always held steadfast to the principles he learned here long ago. It can pay him no higher tribute. 
"May this be a happy ship and a staunch one, worthy of the name it bears; may it always sail its course as truly as its patron did his; and may the spirit of Angus McDonald hover over it, an -inspiration to skipper and crew." 
Scores of telegrams and letters were received at the shipyard from prominent civil and ecclesiastical leaders of the country paying tribute to the memory of Angus McDonald. 
Typical was the message from Fraink 
C. Walker, postmaster general, who expressed the hope that the S.S. Angus McDonald "may have a long and honored career of devoted service to the ITnited States as did Angus McDonald who still lives in our hearts." 
Arthur Stout, president of the ship building company, was master of cere­monies at the launching ceronony. He introduced H. M. Lull, executive vice-president of the railroad, who spoke bri^y telling of his long association with Mr. McDonald and i>aying special tribute to his foresight in anticipating the entrance of the United States inftb the war. Mr. Lull said: "As a result we have been able to shoulder the tre­mendous traffic load that has resulted from the war with an efficiency that would have been impossible had not Mr. McDonald prepared the organization in advance. Mr. McDonald had the respect and affection of all who worked with him and he was always ready to help those under him."

At the front, at the rsar, in the middle — everywhere Notre Dame men are plugging away helping to bring victory and peace to America. for God. for Country, and for Notre Dame. 
According to all the information that we have here 2nd Lt. J. C. O'ConneL', "40, was the first Notre Dame man into Rome. He related upon his return (passing on assignment from the infantry into the Air Corps) that there was a misunder­standing in the original orders. As they got them, they were given the honor of being the first out­fit into Rome and they were to "police it up." They later learned th::t "policing it up" meant cleaning out the snipsrs. 
(Who WAS the tnt Notre Daae •» • faito RMBe? Pvt. Joknny Lynch, '41, uys that he was as far as he knew. Anybody else want to get into the fitst-lato-Rooe derby? A hand-erabraidcred espy . f the "Alamnns" to the winner. And dou­ble that for the first Notre Dcme man into Berlin.—Ed.) ' 
In the first papal audience upon the liberation of Rome were Capt. Jim HcDevitt, '35 (who had a few hours to spare from his duties as a com­pany commander in one of. the hard fighting di­visions over here) and Capt. Jocjc O'Neil, '34. McDevitt, the perennial hustler, reported discov­ering four or five other N.D. men in the audi­ence of four hundred. Unfortunately I don't have their names. 
Others who have been right under our noses and have just been discovered. Capt. Joe Rigney, '28, of Chillicothe, O. He is an assistant judge advocate general. Major Thomas Qaalters, '28, former presidential bodyguard, is over here. Lt. Jack Lehan, '34, is the only Navy man that we have left. Lts. (jg) Jack Walsh, '38. Ned Wein­fartner, '42, and Sam Boyle. "42, all were in the British Isles when last heard from. Undoubtedly by now they have pasted the Germans in their fourth invasion — all are officers on landing craft. 
The second echelon of N.D. men that went into Rome was made up of T^gt. Frank Shay, '35, and myself. We cursed in a Christian sort of way when we ran out of film right smack in front of S t Peter's. 
We had teen assured a pzpal audience (on be­half of Father O'Donnell, the University, and alumni, we chose to bring the Holy Father felici­tations and .sincere well wishes), were passed by the famed Swiss guards, hut the hour was too late. When we get back again we shall most cer­tainly fulfil this pledge. 
Harry Erd, ex. '42. has contacted us by mail but hasn't put in an appearance yet. He's a lieu­tenant in a front line ack-ack outfit. Ed Hogan, '42, finally hit Italy after sweating out "beau­coup" of sand in Africa and a certain island in the Mediterranean. He's corporal, armorer in a P-39 fighter squadron. Jeriy Gorman, '37, is a Tys in a hospital over here. Reports have him cheering everybody up.' Joe Beck, '35, just got back from rest camp and is back in the agnal business. Bill Gwinn, '41, Pfc , another medi­cal man. Ed Tighe. '23, is back here after a brief sojourn in Africa. He's with the OSS. No word has come back from Bob Neibi!, '33. He's a front line M.P.

The University has only recently learned that Lt. Col. Joseph McCaffery, ex. '32, Chester, Pa., brother of the late Lt. Col. Hugh McCafTery, '27, was one of those killed in the heroic Marine action on Guadalcanal. For his part in the campaign Joe was awarded the Navy Cross posthumously. 
Hugh McCaffery was the first Notre Dame man to be killed in service after the United States entered the war. He was in an Army transport plane which crashed in California in December, 1941. 
S/Sgt. William C. Murphy, '33, Middletown, Conn., was one of two Notre Dame men who lost their lives in the crash of a single Flying Fortress over France on Aug. 5, 1943. 
S/SGT. WILLLAM C. MUBPHY, '33 
Since Aug. 25, 1943, Bill had been reported as missing in action but it was only recently that his death was con­firmed to his x>arents. The death of Sgt. Romaine Flife, ex. '43, of Salina, Kans., 
a member of the same crew, was an­nounced last fall. 
Bill entered the Army in July, 1942, and was trained at Keesler field. Miss., and Scott Field, HI., as well as in Utah, Washington and Montana. He went overseas in July, 1943, just a month before he was killed. 
Bill had been graduated from New York State Agricultural College as well as from Notre Dame, and had done additional work at Wesleyan University, Connecticut. Surviving him besides his parents are his brother Jim, and two sisters. 
Since last the ALUMNUS went to press five members of the class of 1939 have been reported as dead in the service of our country. Joe Stulb, John Walsh, George Dempsey, Ed Clarke, and Dan Kelly ^— each had a world of friends on the campus, and every Notre Dame man will deeply feel . this loss. To the parents and fam­ilies of these men the sympathy of every member of the Class of 1939 is extended. 
But as classmates we too share a little of their sorrow; each was a prominent member of the Notre Dame family, "known'to all, and' loved and respected by alL We have a spiritual kinship that all the more brings the tragedy close to OS. God grant this war be brought to a close before more go to join them in eternal rest. 
VINCENT DECOURSEY Secretary, Class of 1939 
Capt. Edward T. Clarke, USMC, '39, Des Moines, la., was killed in action in the Pacific, presumably in the battle of Saipan Idand. Word of his death reached his parents on June 29.

"WHY NO COMMOTION?" 
(Reprint of an interesting editorial) 

In the past few years there have heen two cases in which Catholic college au­thorities took exception to publicized views of members of their staffs. These views the authorities found incompatible with the character of their institutions. Because of the mode of their utterance, they tended to be identified with the institutions themselves. Both times a loud and anguished hue and cry about the violation or supression of academic freedom went up. Chiefly, this was voiced by the totalitarian liberals who seek to direct, down to the last particu­lar, what one must think, say, and do unless one wants to be smeared as a fascist. The Catholic colleges were deni­grated, their oflSdal were pilloried, and sweeping conclusions as to the question­able nature of everything Catholic were drawn. 
Last wedc in New York, action was finally taken in the case of a chemistry tutor at Brooklyn College who, almost four months ago was suspended by the college president because of a letter to the press in which the tutor charged that Communistic activity still existed on the college campus. The case had been strangely ignored during the four-month period. Whether or not the tutor will regain his position is still undecided, but at least some attention has again been givai the matter. 
What interests us is not the disposi­tion of this case so much as the utter failure of the totalitarian liberals—or anyone else, so far as we know—^to be­come exercised and indignant over a possible infringement of academic free­dom. The tutor spoke his mind, was accused of damaging the reputation of the college, and was forthwith sus­pended. No one did any howling. The zealous guardians of academic freedom looked the other way. They left the tutor to his fate. 
Why this .discrimination, this complete reversal of tactics? Could it possibly be because the tutor was outspokenly criti­cal of Communistic activity? Is academic freedom the prerogative only of those who espouse or favor or silently tolerate anything Communistic. We do not know, but we do know that the conduct, in this latest case, of the champions of acad­emic freedom puts a big and permanent question mark on their honest and their motives. — The Catholic Transcript, (Hartford, Conn.) July 13,1944

In part, it reads: "Gene Edwards, who has been athletic director and football coach at St. Vincent's, Latrobe, Pa., has taken a job as salesman for western Penn­sylvania and West Virginia with the National Powder Co. [Ed. note: St. Vincent's has given up athletics for the duration, and the Army Air program there has ended, in which Gene had fceen working. Andy does not say whether Gene intends to return to his coaching post in post­war days.] Gene has three dandy kids . . . Ann. Gene, Jr., and Emily. Cousin Gus (Thomas £.) lives in Charleston and has more young *uns than I can keep up with. Gny Bradley, of Clarksburg, is working with the Hope Gas Co. at Clendennin. 
W. Va." Andy's letter went on — at interesting length, filled with information on other N.D. men. It was a thrill to hear from him, and to note his close; which read: "it wouM be a distinct pleas­ure to spend an evening or two on Serin's front porch with Edwards.

Loa Backley, busy as all get-but with his WPB job — he's just been made assistant branch chief 
— and with his classes at Catholic University four nights a week, still found time to write Paal Bnist, Neil Amiot, Dick Pbelan and John Fontana for news. The results, direct from writer to "Alumnus," follow: 
From John Fontana, 22 H. Gay St.. Columbus 

15. O.: 

Vincent Carey, who has been associated with the Godman Shoe Co. of Columbus, is taking over the managership of a large department store in Idaho. We hate to see Vince go as he has been one of our great supporters at St. Aga­tha's Church. 
During the past year I also had Jerry Shievley of Fostoria, O., drop in to see me. I hadn't seen Jerry since we graduated. He is taking a very active part in the Knights of Columbus and is now employed by the United States Employment Service. -,— -
Vmmk Falter, formerly of Ironton, O.. has been bailiff of the State Industrial Commission and has now accepted a position with the railway mail service. By the grapevine I hear that John Frederick of Muskegon, Mich., is a very busy man and doing well. My old roommate, Martin Rini, I imderstand. is with the law department of the city of Cleveland. 
^rril P. Cline, now a major in the Army stationed near New Zealand, with whom I am associated in the practice "of-law, hopes- to re­turn to the States some time this year. In his piece we now have William H, Dore, formerly of Tiffin, O., v/ho is representing Stranahan, Harris ft Co. (dealing in municipal bonds) of Toledo, O. 
I see Leo Scanlcn, who is now prosecutor at Bucyrus. O., once in a while. During the past year I have also heard from Neil Amiot, who shows by his card that he has a nice family; also Frank Holdampf and Frank Zspone; the lat­ter is now residing in Spokane, Wash. 
Pari Roberto has returned to Cleveland. He 

. was the head of the mining survey department of the industrial relations division of the state of Ohio. 
J w Kinnearyt formerly of Cincinnati and Co­lumbus, is now a captain and is buying groceries 
. for Uncle Sam in Chicago. He is residing at the Chicago Athletic Club. Joe's big smile has not changed as yet. From Dick Pbelan (with Bill Kearney): 
Bert Kom n was home from OCS at Carlisle. Pa., for the funeral of his brother Ray. Bert has fceen in the Army for more than a year and has been stationed at Fort Custer. Camp McCoy, Fort Sheridan, and Sault Ste. Marie. He will soon be a fall fledged <^cer and receive his permanent assignment. 
The Notre Dame Alumnus 
John Isoe called Bill and me the other day to advise us that he hcd given up his position with the F^sodent Company, and is now a sales man­aKer for the Pittsburgh Steel Co. He made in­quiry about Paul Tobin. who is practicing medi­cine in Elgin, and v/ho had just recently received word from his brother. Capt. Jim Tobin. *29. who is stationed at an army hospital in China and w^ho had as one of his patients, the famous Tom Harmon. Paul's younger brother. Dr. John Tobin. is stationed in Italy and took part in the recent drive on Rome. 
Lt. (jf) Ray Drymakki has recently finished his basic training at Tucson. Ariz., and has been assigned to Fort Schuyler. N. Y., for further training. Ray was in town for a couple of weeks and is still a treasurer of the city of Chicsga on leave while in the Navy. He looks fine and is very enthusiastic about his work. 
We occasionally get to see Bill Leahy, who is located in Chicago and is a mid-western sales manager for a large food concern. Bill's old side­kick, lat. Lt. Carroll Pinkley, is stationed at Fort Sheridan, although his duties are such that we do not frequently see him. 
I am sure that everyone in the class will be sorry to learn that Connie Ochoa's mother died at Guadalcanal, Mexico, on June 17. Since the war we have missed Connie, as up until that time he hcd occasionally sojourned in Chicago for a v.eek or two and managed to delay his de­parture until after the football s:ason was over. 
Bill Kearney resigned from the state's attor­ney's office, and he and I are now renegotiating contracts for the Office of The Surgeon General, 20 N. Wacker Dr., Chicago 6. Our work is ex­tremely interesting, tut it does take us out of the city a good part of the time and we do not have the opportunity of seeing so many of the fellows as we used to have. We have heard, how­ever, that Jerry La Stranse is back in Chicago and hope to see him soon. 
John Rickord is still here and is the general superintendent of the quality control department of Armour and Cb. No, word has been received from Ray MnUi^an or Howard Pbalin. both of whom are full lieutenants in the Navy. The last report is that Ray is somewhere on the Pacific and Howie is at Corpus Christie. Texas. 
John McMahon sent in these bits just too late for the June issue: 

Jim Conmey. Jim CuUen and Bob Knox are all naval lieutenants. Came a letter from Conmay from a North African port several months back, promising some good yarns when the war is won. (May we hear those stories soon.) 
According to word from the folks at home. CuUen, my erstwhile fellow-townsman, is on duty in South America. Jim and his pnrtner closed their law offices to join up. 
With our I5th reunion lapsed, we should have a grand and glcrious gat-together when our classmates come marching home. God grant that their ranks be intact! 
Loree Canntngham. of South Bend who re­ceived a Notre Dame degree in 1928 and served for two years as an instructor in physical edu­cation on the campus, was recently promoted to be a major in the Army. He is base special serv­ice officer at MacDill Field air base. Tampa, Fla. He served as a lieutenant in World War I and has a son who is an Army lieutenant.

From Al Schwartz to Paal Foley: 
"If the beloved sergeant doesn't come snooping around I'll dash oft a line or two of informa­tion on men of '37 that has come my way of late. This writing on the sly is very similar to those days of old when we did oor letter-writina: behind books in Doc Cooney's classes in the base­ment of the Library. Han, how nice it would be to be back in those days when one's only worry was whether Father Boland would be standing by the door when you walked out of the Roma Cafe! 
"First and foremost, there's the subject of John Howard Schwartz, a seven-pound, two-ounce bun­dle of baby who's been calling me *Pop* since June 18. That makes two boys for the A. J. Schwartzs. 
"Brother-in-law Frank •Pinky* Carroll of du­bious New Rochelle fame also is a new papa. He and Betty now have two girls, the last one bom April 11. Frank is a captain in anti-aircraft and stationed at Fort Meade. Md.

George Dempsey, who tragically met his death in the action north of Rom.:, had been credited by Grahm Hovey, INS corraspondent, with the capture of the German general, Willibald Boro­wiecz. and his complete loth panzer division in a wheatfield in Tunisia. Geonre was far out In front of his unit when he met an United States army captain in an olive grove. The American had been captured and ssnt out as an emissary to meet the American forces. He led Capt. Demp­sey to the bivouac, where the general surrendered his entire group of 300 men and officers: 
The Silver Star was awardsd George for his gallantry in the fighting in Kaserine Pass. Tlie citation accompanying the medal said in part: "The fearless and aggressive leadership with which he conducted his attack served as an ex­ample and inspiration to his men and contributed materially toward stopping the enemy attack. His tank was hit by an anti-tank shell and set afire. When he was unable to extinguish the fire he ordered his crew to abandon the tank. He was the last to leave He led his crew back to his own lines, procured another tank and rejoined the company." 
Of the 27 ofiicers of his battalion who left England with George, only four remained alive at the end of the Tunisian campaign, and se\'eral weeks before the fall of Rome only two remained. 
Bill Mahoney is another Navy officer recently 
How he talked with Pope Plus XH, Litt. D.. '36, not long after the American forces entered Rome is related by Lt. Aastin J. Wall of Pittsburg in a letter (printed in a Pittsburgh paper) to Margaret L. Wise, secretary to William B. McFall, president of the Commonwealth Trust Company, Pittsburgh. 
"When we passed St. Peter's," he writes, "I took off alone to see the Pope. I contacted a bishop who could speak Eng­lish. I told him I was a Notre Dame graduate, showed him my Notre Dame ring and told him I had met His Holiness when he was at Notre Dame in 1936, and asked for an audience. He took me to see the Secretary of States who in turn took me in to see the Pope. His Holiness wore a pure white roba with a purple sash. We chatted for almost seven minutes. The first words he said were, 'Welcome to Rome, son.* Then we shook hands. 
"I made quite a contrast with His Holi­ness—my trousers torn—unshaven—dirty —^mud on my shoes—and what not. Peo­ple come from all over the world just to see. not talk with, the Pope—and along comes a dirty, unshaven infantry lieuten­ant who talks to him for seven minutes! 
"When His Holiness finished, he blessed me and I departed. Outside. I jumped into my jeep and caught up with my platoon before they reached the outskirts. In cme hour, I had seen what some people never see in a lifetime."

Let's lead off with CpL Walter J. McNalDy, now stationed somewhere in India at a base which sent the famed B-29s off to blast Japan. On July 1, Walt air-mailed: 
"Your note w-as. forwarded from home to me in my present station 'somewhere in India.' I am gratified for this opportunity to contact some of the old gang. 
"A brief resume of my Army career is as fo|. lows: I enlisted in the aviation cadets in Jane. '42. and after eight and one-half months had the misfortune of washing out. Since that day.

"I'm expecting Gabby home the end of July— th«e's no definite date. And I sincerely hope and pray that nothing prevents his return. In several letters, Gafaty has told me how happy he will be to get back to the normal way of living. 
"Gabby is an excellent pilot. He has a* good brain and makes use of it. But I'm positive that he as well as I realize that his accomplishments could not have been reached without the help of God. Wa most thank God daily. 
"Cabby refuses to ose tracer ballets . because 'sometimes yoa slip up behind a guy and miss with the first few bursts. Those tracers give yon away.' 
"He also goes into combat with half the amount of ammunitifm normally citrried, contendinsT that , a full load makes the wings too heavy to torn conveniently inside a Uessersdimitt." 
Frank, his classmntes will remember, enlisted in the Air Corps in 1940. 
Next on the list sending information is faith­ful Mrs. Lora Lashbrocdc, the custodian of news from the I.aw Department. She writes: 
"At lone last we had some news of Al Bnraa.. He is now Lt. Boms of the Air Corps and is serving in the legal department.

We got it: 'When I opened your letter it was my tarn to be speechless. Front cover stuff— Kathered in such an undercover way!' He added that life was hazardous for a Marine out that way, but that this publicity would increase the odds asainst him if the other Marines ever heard of it. Joe reports that Bob Safsran is in his area bat he had not seen him. 
"Leo Lindc was inducted into the Air Corps and is still trsinin? at San Antonio, Tex. Lt. Tim Ibher has been ^ven a medical discharge from the Army and is back in Pennsylvania ready to practice law.

Bill Spansler wrote from Barksdsle Field. La., recently. His wife was spending the summer months in a nearby town, so his free hours are mor;^ enjoyable now. Gerald Kamm, who is with the Allied Supreme Command in England, has written us once since the invasion started. He is confident that the European -war is entering its last stages now. HIIS optimism was also appar­ent in two recent letters from Lt. S. R. Qninn of the Air Forces in that area. Ray writes that he expects to get home this fall, with the victory already won in that area. We hope they are both right. 
"Warren DeaU wrote this week, too, from Camp Blanding where he is still stationed. He had spent a short furlough at Daytona Beach and recommends it to us highly. Lt. Jade Tallett of the Air Corps was in to say 'hello' a few days ago. on June 15. He is as handsome as ever, and the officers* uniform did his appearance no harm whatever. 
On July 25, Lt. PhU Lacier, USNR, wrote from the U.S. Naval Training School at Dear­bom, Mich., where he is now located: 
"Just returned from too long in the South Pa­cific and have been turned out to grass here in Dearborn. It's real luxury. Passing through Pearl Harbor I met Bob Raaf at the Officers* Club there along with some N.D.'s of before our time. On the veranda of the Boyal Hawaiian. I saw TMM Reis, '41, who told me of some of the wild experiences of his brother Jack, *42. in the Anzio landings in Italy. Jack did very well by himself. 
"I used to see Mike Kelly and Bob Har^rave down in Tula^ often and iust missed Bob Math­ews and some of the boys, as Bob reported in the June 'Alumnus.* Watched Bob Hargrave from my safe little destroyer when he made a couple of landings in the Upper Solomons. He rides the small boats to the beach. 
"Met Evelyn Zinz (St Mary*s '42), Jack Ber­cen's fiancee, in South Bend on my leave. Jack is in England. We toured the campus and for the information of the Commerce boys. Mr. Eells and Dean McCarthy are still very much present It was wonderful to get 'home* to see Red and Shorty in the laundry and the Fathers Gene and Tom BiiriEe on their afternoon walk. Here in De­troit I learned that Joe Diamond has just ar­rived in England." 
Yep, Eni. Geoixe UU is now at Bowdoin Col­lege Brunswick, Me. He wrote that he met Chock Lattiaer, ch^nical engineer of the class of '41, at Bowdoin but Chuck has now been sent to Boston. George also met a fellow in training who hmlB from Columbus, 0-, and is a friend of B«b Finnetan and Ckariie Bitzer. 
John A. Deery of Indianapolis came throagfa with some very interesting comment on his aom, Lt. Paal, of our class. 
"I read with interest the last copy of the Notre Dame 'Alumnus* before it was forwarded to FanU In a letter dated June 14, Paul wrote from a wheat field north of Rome, saying in part: 
" 'This paper is the courtesy of some Italian Farm Program. Things certainly have been pop­ping. I've seen a lot of things since I last wrote, from the wreckage of battle to only a few, un­fortunately, of the glories of Rome. Anuo Beach was certainly fought-over ground but the town of Cistema is a pile of rubble. All houses shot through and through and a great many just piles of stone. Tanks lay deserted on both sides of the road and in the fields. In many places there is a strong odor of decaying flesh. The advance moved so fast there was not time to bury the bodies. Bat further up' as the Germans retreated faster there is little sign of destruction.'" 
The next day, Mr. Deery wrote again: 
"Since writing yesterday. I received a letter from Paul dated July 12. He received an annex­pected two-day pass and visited Rome and had an audience with the Pope. He said it took place -'in a large room filled with Allied soldiers from the United States, British. French, Polish and tbe ever-turbaned Mohammedans. He had a rosary blessed by the Fope and is sending it to his 
mother. 
"It seems that Paul had a very narrow escape on Anrio Beach. He did not tell us. but we knew something happened. The mother of a boy that he wrote to told us that Paul and two other lieiz­tenants were living in a foxhole and they kept thdr cloOii^ in a tent less than 15 feet from thor living quarters. The Germans made a direct hit on the tent We knew Paul's clothes were de­stroyed but that was all we were told. Paul also said that he received a letter from Frank Fox.** 
It's Lt. Tom Power* now, of the MP Detadi­ment at New Orleans, La- He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Transportation Goips at New Orleans on July 12. He writes: 
"Am just now getting used to • returning sa­lutes instead of initiating them most of the time. B«ng called sir is hard to get accustomed to after almost two years as a GI. The saleslady in the PX was talking to me for about three min­utes before I realized it. Am very satisfied with my assignment It's a crackerjack company and the duty is interesting. Strangely, I got what X asked for: troop duty with an MP outfit in, a port overseas. 
"My kid brother, Johnny, is at the Air Base now just starting Transportation Corps OCS in New Orleans. Got the news about his assignment here while at the pre-graduation dinner-danee and so made it a double-celebration. He's from the infantry at Fort Meade­
"Here*s £L story that brought three alumni to­gether. Through a casual meeting with a soldier in New Orleans, I found that Bill Dillon, '42, tbe track star, was in New Orleans awaiting Aip­ment I made plans to meet Bill in N.O. on pass but the deal fell through. But Dillon bumped into Bob LeMense who was in town on pass from Camp Livingston and LeMense dropped out to the air hase to see me. 
"Met another N.D.er who is in Class 22.at the OCS. Bin Hawk of the class of '32 was broofibt back from the Persian Gulf area for OCS. Met him shortly before graduation at N.O. He ^ied the copy of the 'SchoUiEtic* I was carrying and VopptA the question. I'm writing Paal NeriBe to­morrow. Haven*t written since last March-'* 
Another pleasant surprise came in the fine collection of news submitted by BiB Hidiey on Jabr 22: 
."Well, here is something that I have been go­ing to do for the past two years; write a letter to yoa and let you know what goes on with mem­bers of our class with whom I have had contact I am stationed in an office — United States Coast Guard. 610 S. Canal St. — in Chicago, but the majority of my time is spent in travelling the Ninth Naval District not the entire district, just niinms, Michigan, Indiana and Wisconsin. 
"I have been to Notre Dame several times in the last couple of months, and of course the place is still somewhat the same, the only big difference is the uniforms. I had a nice visit with Fadwr Batler (Dillon hall), as I did with Fatiwr Carey. Frank Caalkins is still passing out those fanooos grades of his in Statistics, only Navy peronnel are now the recipients. 
"To get to fellows I have heard from: Bill Stufcitts is stationed at Truax Field, Madison, Wis., — really a dream for duty too. Don Hogan, who became the father of a son on Feb. 23. is now on his way to sea as G.C. Officer on a PCE(R). now undergoing shakedown at MiamL TsB Naah is signal officer on the — now at sea in the Atlantic 
"Steve Graliker came through Chicago about a month ago and we had a nice visit He was then en route to Atlanta after having been trans­ferred from Corpus Christ!. *B«nk' Regan is up at Madison. Wis., with Sturbitts as a P.E. direc­tor of some kind- . . . 
"I received several letters from Bob ADen (New Rochelle). who is stationed at Camp Hood. Texas. Bob married a Texas belle about Jan. 15. and is as happy as the proverbial lark. . . . Larry Hickcy is still down at Jacksonville, and he has been there since he went into service, I guess. 
"Hy old roomie, Byron Kanaley, is now in Chi­cago on vacation from Carbon and Carbide in New York. Jim McNalty wrote me about the first of May; he had just been discharged from ^ck bay after a successful bout with yellow jaundice He was on Guadalcanal in a boat pool, but could not reveal his new duty. Saw in the paper today (July 18) that Paal LiUis had been awarded the Silver Star and the Purple Heart He is skipper of a PT in the Pacific Paal KeHy (Syracuse) called me about a month ago on his way to the west coast He is stationed at an Army base in Los Angeles. He is in Air Corps administration." 
"Ens. John Baty telephones from a South Bend hotel two weeks ago to say he had come into town from Terre Haute where he attended his sister's graduation, with the intention of coming out for a visit, but he had overslept and had to make a train., This explanation would not be questioned by anyone who knew John in his stu­dent days (or daze). 
"Harry Marray, who is an attorney for the Board of Education in Chicago, .spent the week here the first wedc in July. He is doing a good job for the Board and is looking very profes­sional. pidE Focarty, who has been connected with a local insurance firm, finally decided to take the bar exanunation on July 11 or 12." 
Another newcomer to the ranks of the writers-in is Lt. Dick Kern, who airmailed on May 24: 
"Not mudi time to write and not much news to pass on, but thought I'd drop you a couple of lines and see if yon can help me with the -ad­
i of a couple of the boys I've lost track of. 

I'd like to get the addresses o{ Ji a iHck, Jim Conway and Don Grant. Grant and I^ck hit the Navy and Conway joined the Marines hut that's the last I*ve heard of any of them. 
"Set. Eddie Genchty is in the same outfit with me here on the Island of Maui in the Hawaiians. Set. Jim SifUano, ex. '42, last stationed at Fort Benninff, is the only other one of our class I've met so far." 
Dick is with a cannot company. 

At last reports. Ens. George UM, who had at­tended Ft- Schuyler, N. Y., was furloughing: in New- Washington. O.. awaiting orders for a new assignment. While in the New York City area, he met Fred Panlman, John Roser, Creorge Fraz­ier, Walt Brennan, who is now at Jefferson Med school in Philadelphia, and Byron Kanaley. He -was due to report to Bowdoin college on June 1. 
Remember Pvt. John Q. O'Connell* former col­umnist for the "Scholastic?" He's hit the news again. On May 30. iust too lat« for the last issue of the "Alumnus," the Chicago "TVibune" carried a story by Clay Gowran. Gowran related that O'Connell was the first on the stand to be the model, for some sketches by Maj. IMck IQrsch­baum of Newark, former cartoonist and avia­tion writer from the Newark "News." This affair took place at the Red Cross station in New Delhi. India. Said O'Connell: 
"I've developed several pastimes out here to help me make the time go by until I can get back home. Because India is supimsed to be a land of gems. I've become a gem collector. Also, with all these ageKild temples sprawling on all sides. I've taken up photography in a big way and should have thousands of snaps when I go home, enough to bore my friends for years to come." 
We wrote to Jim Conway at Bardstown. Ky., and got a reply from his dad, James F. Conway. Sr- who is mayor of that town. Mr. Conway re­ported that Jim has been with the Marines for two years in the South Pacific. He is a lieutenant. 
Another Marine to hop into the news was Lt. Vincent A. Daigler, picture and all. Let us quote from the July 8 issue of the Marine Corps 
•'Chevron," published in the San Diego area: , 
"USNH—San Diego—^Wounded at Cape Glou­cester while trying to dispose of a live Jap 
LT. VINCS DAIGU», '42 grenade, Ist Lt, Vincent A. Daisler of Kenmore.

"The grenade exploded as Lt. Daigler grabbed at it. shrapnel striking him in the face and nde. None of the four men near was injured and one made a quick end of the thrower. Six hours later Lt. Daigler's helpers placed him on the beach where he underwent an emergency operation. 
"In the Corps two years, the former Irish grid-man spent IS months in the South Pacific, sev­eral of them on Guadalcanal." 
Here's hoping for a quick recovery. Vince-

By way of Joe Ragolia's sister, Josephine, comes word that Joe has been prwnotcd to first lieutenant with the Ninth Air Force and is now in France. His wife, the former Dorothy L. War­ner, of Florence, S. C, resides with her parents. Joe and she were married June 2G. 1943. at Mi­ami Beach, Fla.. and are the parents of James Michael, bom July 15. 1944. 
Hugh Fullerton, Jr., in his nationally-syndi­cated sports column for the Associated Press, re­ported on June 14 that Knnte K. Rockne. Jr.* ex. '42, is in the Aleutians with the Army, while his younger brother. Jackie, has just taken prelimin­ary vows in the Franciscan order. 
On June 1 came another report from Lt. Jim O'Langhlin, Marine officer in the South Pacific- Said Jim: 
"He:ird from Dan Holwell the other day. He's aboard a Navy transport as signal officer. He was 'officer-clubbing* with Jim O'Neill and some other Notre Damers. We're out of action now and ate not doing much of anything. Tliat sore was tough about Ed Dickson and Fatlwr Trakry. Both good men and Hked by all. 
"Don Qninn got hitched. He married a staff sergeant in the WACS whom he met in Evans­ville, Ind. I hear from Prof. John Brranan and he keeps me posted on the Notre Dame of today."

From Bnl Laacrcu: 

This month things are a ]ot hriKhter. The book-of-the-month award sees to OlBc Haater -with his two-mile boolc Ollie lias this to say: "I am still ourryins on as an athletic officer at Colnm­hia midshipmen school, bat I hope to see soma action in the near future. It was certainly inter­esting to read about all our classmates, but par­ticularly about Fiaak GabrakL As Fatter La>­fcawiki, CS-C, wiio is studying Rus^an here on campus, said, *I don't know what it is. but these Notre Dame men can't be beat. Especially a sood Folish lad like Frank.' 
"Pfe. Jalui P. Hoiir. USHC, ckss of '43. has been presented the Purple Heart . • . after two and oneJialf years in the Pacific. Ena. Fiaak CumttU is aboard a. YHS in England: he has been a daily visitor to Eaa. Geae FeUis in the British hospital. Gene was roughed up • lut dur­ing- tlie big invasion, bat he is coming along fine, and is a proud father. Ena. Jack Beis was in to see ne and he had seen Ena. Taay IfilaM/ taking supplies onto the Anzio beachhead aboard 
The Notre DamcAlumnus 
an amphibious craft. Tony, by the way, wrote hack that he visited Dick Tnpta of the U.S. Army in Europe recently. Ens. William Jchnson writes from the Pacific where he is aboard a PC. 
"Arnold Cleveland, class of '42 and U.S. Army, was in Texas in a tank buster battalion the last time I heard. Ens. Rudolph Gans recently sent me his preetings from Puerto Rico, via messen­ger, where he is aboard a mine sweeper. Ensigns Tom Conley* Red Ryan and Jim Delaney. who all finished up with me last November, went to the Pacific under sealed orders. Ens. Jack Barry cauffht a LST out of New Orleans, which is the-last I heard concerninff him. 
"Ens. Charlie Butler, who did some fine basket­ball playing here, is now in amphibious training in Virginia. Frank Stewart was recently dis­charged from the Na\'y and is now working in Boston. He gave me the sad news that 'Beans' Hj^es of the Army Air Corps is now missing over Europe. Don Kotz is working in Chicago. I hear. Ens. Harry McKnight was in not long ago to see ms. He is aboard an amphibious LST and was headed up Newfoundland way. Ens. Eddie Panlman is working for one of the larger air­lines in the Pacific, according to Jim Traccy of South Bend, whom I tripped into last month at "Die Tavern on the Green.' 
"Ens. Don Miller u-rites from one of the Caro­line Islands, where he and a group of Marines landed. Saw Bill Stewart's dad in Boston and he said Bill was in a pouthem camp right now and expected to get married soon. Ens. Bill McCaugh­ey was in New York sometime ago when his destroyer dropped anchor in New York harbor. Lt. James Parccll is looking good these d?ys; had a chat with him at the Garden one night They tell me Bill Woods has been very active over Germany. Jay Gibson is a lieutenant in the Army now." 
A card from Frank Haley read something like this, "Just arrived at Har\'ard for an eight-week AAF statistical course. Got my commission at Air Corps CCS in Miami Beach. Joe Tracj-, who was with me down in Florida, is now attending an eight weeks intelligence course at Orlando, Fla. Sam M^oaid got his bars a month ahead of me and is now at De Bidder Field down in IfOuisi­ana. Pinky Walsh finished at Miami Beach a month ahead of that, but where he is I do not know." 
A newsy letter was sent in by Grace Kane, sister of Hank Kane, with these lines for con­sumption. "You don't know me but I send my, brother. Hank Kane, the 'Alumnus' every month. Hank sure likes to receive them and I know it definitely lifts his spirits a great deal. He was home last Janunry after a tough sojourn in Sici­ly, Salerno, and North Africa. He looked grand and we know that *Our Lady' must have carried him through. Hank received a commendation for having carried out his duties as a hatch officer, aboard his previous ship. It was delivered with personal congratulations from his ship's captain. He was home long enough to have a good rest and a swell time. He sent me an invitation to his new ship's commissioning which T accepted with the enthusiasm of a Notre Dame freshman. It was very impressive and instructive. Hank is first division officer and has quite a job on his hands. The other day I received two little carved bow-wows from him. I forgot to mention that he is now in the South Pacific and working very hard. He says that he is sorry he missed D-day. but I fear we don't share the same sentiments in that department. 
"Hank has never forgotten his Notre Dame training and neither will ihe family. He is truly a 'Fighting Irishman.* Hank would like to be re­membered to the class of 1942, and the facult^r. 
Do you boys remember Long John MoUoy? He is now a radio technician out at Great Lakes. Ibe last I heard of Ens. Frank King he was getting over cat fever which he contracted in North Africa. He is stationed in Bsllvue in Florida. Doc Dooling is an army flyer. I understand the scientist Bill Frye is now married." 
Well. Grace, v.-hat w-e need is more letters like this. How about it. relatives? 
This month was full of surprises. Joe "Hot­man" Tracy came through with a swell letter. He writes: "At OCS in Miami Beach Jce B. Lewis, class of '39, was my roommate . . . Frank Haley, Jack 'Pinky' Walsh and Sam HcGowan also earned commissions with me at Miami Beach. Ten minutes after I arrived I met Dick Whalen, class of *41. in the cafeteria. . . . The Godfrey brothers and Jim Cahill are still some­where in the Pacific In my last letter from Jim Godfrey, he spoke of having spent some time at a rest camp. I passed through Jim Downey's home town. West F^lm Beach, on my way to Or­lando and found out from his sister that he is headed for parts unknown as an engineer's gun-
Sgt. John Powers sent in a letter that just missed last time, so I will include it in here. Since the letter I ran into John on the Nfitre Dame campus. Hs was on his way to New Or­leans for Transportation Corps DCS. His brother Tom, commissioned recently at the same spot, re­mained on the school's staff end may be one of John's teachers. Here's what John had to say in his letter: "Tommy and I got together on a few week-ends in Washington when he was located with the M.P.'s at Camp Patrick, Va-I went into the station hospital here on St. Patrick's Day with a throat infection and was there for 13 dull days. Feel fine now. While there I bumped into PanI Pacheco, class of '43, who was con­fined with a fractured wrist. Paul just completed infantry training at Camp Fannin, Texas, and is on his way through the replacement depot to an overseas destination. My ex-roomie, CpL Thomas McCreedy, is still training recruits at Camp Btanding, Fla. In a late letter he hinted that he might be transferred to Camp Robinson, Ark. I was lucky to get away for the N.D.-N.Y.U­basketball game in New York. Met Frank LareBe and Marty Fitzpatrick outside of the Garden. Fitz is in medical school at Columbia. About a month ago I ran into 1st Lt. Art Rhodes, class of Ml, who was going through the replacement and is probably on his way overseas." 
Now for a little about the home folks. Eddly Ryan had a going-away party just before he was inducted into the service. Yours truly missed it as I had already made plans' for a trip to school to do some work on an article, which will prob­ably wind up in a Master Comics publication. It was swell to get back to that grand old place. After this war I am in favor of making it a 50­year course instead of a four. I found Father Brennan in his same old fishing spot, in the mid­dle of the lake; outwitting the bass. 
Walter Ziemba told me that Lou Rymkas is the proud father of twins. Jim Ford and his brother Bill are studying their heads off down at North­western Medical school. Got a letter from Vince Commisa who has been honorably discharged from the army and is back home in Newark. Claims he will take Notre Dame over Yale any day. Vince would like to play some pro ball. He plans to come to Chicago for a few weeks, which will be swell for this gent. Jerry Kiliiffrcw dropped in on a very busy night and I had little time to talk with him, but he is looking in the pink. He w^s home on furlough after several weeks of active duty. John McHalcf one of our 
boys who left Notre Dame to play for the De­troit Hgers baseball team, is now an officer In the Navy and is stationed here at Northwestern. Pat FIDey is honorably discharged from the Marines and is back at Notre Dame. He recently had an operation on his knees. Dick McHngh is really working hard down on his farm down at BCanhattan. 111. 
From Ed Roney: 
Another September is rolling around and it turns out to be just another September. What a lot of us would give for the old type with the moving into rooms, trying to remember where we stored our radio and chair, picking up class cards, having our first bull session and missing lunch in order to get the best football tickets. But, in the service, September's like Jure (it certainly never was before) and it takes a while to re­monber the day of the week-
And there haven't been many of those "post office bull sessions" lately. Only three letters this month. We're all darn busy (I am too), but let's get in there pitching. 
First, a letter from a guy who is right now hauling things to the Normandy front — Fred Gore. Cnie plural he uses concerns himself and Joe Callahan). 
"On our way to India after partaking in the Italian campaign," Fred writes, "we picked up LOT Lt- (jg) Tom Stritch, former N.D. English prof, llie professor, I'm sad to relate; got off at journey's end and didn't come back to God's country with us. The trip was quite interesting, with the sights of Egypt. Arabia, Ceylon, India. Burma.- etc, providing the diversion. Callahan and myself, of course, like all 'locos Americanos' got clipped. But it was really good while it lasted. We picked up some souvenirs along the line, too. 
"Next month Joe and I and all of the others in *our overseas class will celebrate our first anni­
versary — one year overseas. July 27. to be 
exact 
"In England, getting to London has been our one ambition. We've been in that English me-" tropolis twice on leave but it's not enough. Scot­land and Wales have also felt our wandering feet. . . . 
"On board here we also have Francis N. La-Vdle, '34, who is currently and for the past 14 months, executive officer. With three of the men from school on this ship, we've nicknamed it 'LSTND.'" 
The letter was signed by both Fred and Joe. Many thanks indeed. 
The second letter comes from J. J. Becker, of the Destroyer Escort Beckers. He writes: 
"Today being a hell of a rough day, and be­cause it's almost impossible to sleep. I decided to catch up on my correspondence. . . . Got pitched out of my bunk last evening, so now am sleep­ing on the deck. Ibings are going very smoothly aboard the — now and I hardly realize that it's almost six months since we put her into com­mission. Can't tell where we've been but just add another campaign bar to my collection. When across I tried to find some trace of Kurtz and Coonty but was unsuccessful. 
"I'm now assistant communications officer and you know how I hate that. But, as my old room­mate, Ja d Hickey, used to say, that's life. This DE life isn't too bad as we get into part occa­sionally and that makes up for the rough times at sea. The storm we are in now has teen going on for four days and I'm really whippetL TTie barometer has just started to rise so have pros­pects of a good night's sleep for a change. 

"Haven't heard much news lately. In fact, none at all for over two months. If you see Girard, tell him hello for me." 
Thanks, chum. 

llie third letter is from Red Lonercan, saying that he is more than busy. I won't print it be­cause you'll hear from him for the greater part of this issue. 
Red mentions Ken Daffy's death in a hangar fire. If I remember correctly. Ken left school about his sophomore year to enter the service. 
Here's a plug for the Detroit N.D. Club's paper. "Notre Dame in Ser\'ice.** One of the best ideas I've ever seen: its a mimeographed paper mod­eled after any of these columns and containing letters from and news for the Detroit Notre Dame men in service. But I still haven't seen any news from those members of our class who are from Detroit. 
A thousand bov.-s to Red for coming through so well.

David R. Condmi, csi* « Office, Notre DUM , lad. 

From Dave Condon: 
The question of where to begin is just as per­plexing now as it was three weeks ago when BID Brown dropped in and suggested we tour his luu­tive. and my adopted, city. We started, and the same with this report. A week prior to Bill's visit. John McCiowan had dropped down from Northwestern and we had an evening cbout the village. The three of us never could make it to­gether because John went home and found free transportation to the Pacific coast, with the Navy footing the expense. 
The last I heard, Jim Clarke was at the Lakes, and that has been recent. Scrap Toanff told me that he received word from Jim White in New York and Father Carey told me that Bob Danne was at OCS. The mril brought a surprise V-mail from Lt. George Sdiwartz. an absentee of two years, who is now directing public relations in some southwest Pacific air group. Tom Doagker* ty, Jr., (the one with the "V" as a middle ini­tial) recently had a girl down south to pin on his wings — and reciprocated by giving her a rinff. 
I've had V-mail letters from Georce Conwajr, in the Hawaiians, whose fate is shared by Ronald Carter, and from Bill Gorman, aboard one of the battle wagons. A fellow here in the ofiice used to work with Heltzel, but Don is again uncommuni­cative. Gerry Hoffne wrote from Anzio — that's what became of the ERC. I saw Joknny Lajack and Gerry Ford before they left school, and Ln had heard from Paul Limont, who is now an en­sign. Comie Clatt is getting in step for the All-Stnr football game and is going to lead the pa­rade. I had a letter from Jack (Tippy) Lsrkin, who is working in the sports department of the "Newark Evening News." 
Dick Boms is still at Loyola School of Medi­cine, with the Navy. He invited me out to Aurora over the 4th, but I couldn't make it. All youse guys write to me, please.

missions and 500 combat hours, the colonel, who said, "Nobody in a tactical unit has a desk job," was shot down in action. Once when the tank of his ship was "shot to pieces" over Wewak he made a crash landing in the Kamn Yti­ley. The other time he was forced to crash land in shark-infested waters lOO miles from Kabanl after antiaircraft fire and Jap Zeros wrecked his ship. "It would have been too bad, he' said, if a PT boat hadn't picked me up." Wonnded by sheU splinters, he was awarded the Purple Heart. This was the same mis­sion for which he was decorated with the D. S. C, and more than 125,000 tons of Jap ships went to the bottom of Rabaol harbor. 
In October of 1943 he and a squadron of 14 planes were making a routine sweep hunting for Jap barges in the Cape Gloucester area. "We were flying at about 50 feet," he recalled, "when we sifted two Jap destroyers, one a flotilla leader. We all took a crack at them and each destroyer took 10 to 15 hits with 500-pound bombs. Half of one of the destroyers is still beached on a reef." Henebry got the Silver Star for his part in that action.—South Bend Tribune, July S5, 19U. 
ALL-STAR GAME 

Notre Dame has entered more names on the All-Star roll of honor as AU-American Creighton Miller, Ail-Ameri­can Jim White, Corwin Clatt, John Adams and Bill Huber have accepted bids to play against the world pro champion Chicago Bears in Dyche Sta[­dium, Evanston, 111., on Aug. 30. 
And the Who, Where, When and How of MaiHng It? 
1.
 The ALUMNUS (published in Feb­ruary, April, June, August, October and De­cember) is mailed to all priests, brothers and nuns who have Notre Dame degrees; to all members of the Alumni Association who have made contributions in the current year (since August, 1943) to the Alumni Fund; and to all members of the Alumni Association who are registered in the Alumni Office as members of the armed forces (regardless of any contribu­tion to the Alumni Fund). 

2.
 News of Notre Dame, a four-page tabloid paper made up from the principal gen­eral news in each issue of the ALUMNUS, is mailed to all members of the Alumni Associa­tion not covered above. 

3.
 All holders of Notre Dame degrees are, automatically, members of the Alumni Associa­tion. All former Notre Dame students who are not holders of Notre Dame degrees may ask for election to the Alumni Association by apply­ing to its Board of Directors through the Alumni Secretary. 

4.
 The ALUMNUS is, as a rule, mailed to the home addresses of members of the armed forces in the expectation that their families will promptly forward the magazine to them. While the service-man is still within the United States this procedure is the only reasonable one since 


service addresses within the country are gen­erally changed so often. However, 
5.
 In the case of service-men with over­seas addresses, the Alumni Office will be glad to mail their magazines directly to them. Re­quests for this procedure should be made to the Alumni Office. 

6.
 Only the publisher of the ALUMNUS can send it overseas by second class mail. If a private individual wishes to mail the magazine overseas, first class postage is required. 

7.
 Copies of the ALUMNUS cannot be forwarded without the addition of extra postage. If, without adding postage, you put a forward­ing address on an ALUMNUS envelope, it will be returned to the Alumni Office, postage collect. 

8.
 The principal moral: keep that address up-to-date in the Alumni Office. 


P. S. If s also a good idea to make your annual contribution, to the Alumni Fund. This Fund this year becomes identified with the cal­endar year. Gifts made since last August (1943) will be credited for the entire year of 1944. This Second Annual Alumni Fund will close on De­cember 31, 1944. See Class reports for big job ahead between now and then.
