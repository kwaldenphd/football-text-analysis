To the Coaches and the Team of 1938 
Notre Dame men, through the ALUMNUS, take this opportunity to extend congratulations to head coach Elmer Layden, '25, his assistants, and the varsity squad of 1938. 
An alumni-coached team in an alumni-administered college must always advance alumni interest and enthusiasm. When it is accompanied by victories, as in the 1938 season, naturally both are intensified. And when, in defeat, as in the ultimate reversal at Southern California, appear those things deeper than victory, which Notre Dame has always taught, and which informed American sportsmanship under the leadership of Knute K. Rockne, '14, then alumni everywhere rejoice. 
The football season of 1938 has produced—and nothing more complimentary could be said—another company of Notre Dame men who take their places with '88, '03, '09, '24, '29, '30,, and other Notre Dame immortals beloved but less sung.

THE COVER PICTURE 
A low - lyin? cloud enabled Robert Walters, '41, Marion, Obio, to catch this significant night picture of the dome by means of a time exposure. To him and to Father Frank Gart­land, C.S.C, '33, prefect of re­ligion, the ALUMNUS is in­debted for a striking cover. The picture was first used on the RELIGIOUS BULLETIN on October 1 of this year. 
And, to answer your question in advance, there was no re­touching. The picture is present­ed to you just as it was taken. 

John F. O'Hara, C.S.C, president of the University. Rev. Norbert C. Hoff, associate professor of philosophy, gave an outstanding address on the significance of the Medal. 
Amon g the many distinguished guests present for the occasion were the following : Most Rev. Joseph Schrenibs, bishop of Cleveland; Most Rev. Joseph E. Ritter, bishop of In­dianapolis; Rev. Dennis P. Bums, SJ., president of Xavier University, Cincinnati; Rev. John L. Sheridan, president of Mt. St. Mary's College, Emmitsburg, Maryland; and Dr. E. 
A. Kent, president of the University of Louisville, with Mrs. Kent. Mem­bers of the St. Joseph Valley section of the American Medical Association were especially invited guests. 
•M-EWSPAPER AND RADIO have 
^ long since brought to most ALUM­NUS readers the happy news that Father John F. O'Hara, C.S.C, presi­dent of the University, is one of his country's representatives to the Pan-American conference which opened in Lima, Peru, on December 9. Father O'Hara, with other members of the United States delegation headed by Secretary of State Cordell Hull, sailed for South America on November 25. 
Through the initiative of the Notre Dame Club of New York and the 

kindness and cooperation of the Co­OLD-TIMERS AT MINNESOTA GAME 
lumbia Broadcasting Company, Father O'Hara was heard in an international broadcast from Lima on Sunda y morning, December 11. The New York club had previously planned a Com­munion-breakfast for that morning in which the success of the Pan-American conference would be the chief spiritual objective. The cooper­ation of other Notre Dame clubs throughout the country had been en­listed toward the same objective, with a gratifying response. 
Before he sailed Father O'Hara an­nounced his plans for an extensive study of South .American educational institutions, with a view to closer co­operation between them and schools of the United States. Father O'Hara said: "I e-xpect to discuss with officials of various South .American schools the possibilities of locating scholars and teachers who are being displaced in Europe. Our own e.xperience in this regard has been highly gratify­ing and I feel confident that other ed­ucators will be interested in it." 
Into such planning, as well as into his duties as a member of the United States delegation to the conference. Father O'Hara takes an extensive background in South American af­fairs. Before studying for the priest­hood he was, like his father, em­ployed in the consular service in Uru­guay. From 1919 to 1923, he had charge of a news service which served 75 Latin-American newspapers. For several years he was prominent in the National Foreign Trade Council and, in 1920, as dean of the College of Commerce he made a tour of South America, arranging for a mutual rec­ognition of college credits and making provisions for an exchange of stu­dents. 
When he left the campus. Father O'Hara planned to return in mid-Feb­ruary. In his absence Father Hugh O'Donnell, vice-president, is acting president. 
"POURTEEN NOTRE DAME scien­•*• tists participated in the program of the Indiana Academy of Science conducted at Purdue University in early November. The following either read papers or had assisted in their preparation: Dr. Theodor K. Just, Dr. George F. Hennion, G. M. Wolf, John Goncher, Dr. Lawrence H. Baldinger, Dr. William H.

Giving Is Not a New Idea 
Rockne Memorial Campaign Among Notr e Dame 
Alumni Reveals Our Alumni Unaware of Vital Part of 
Giving in Development of American Higher Education 
(Ed Note: Following is an article prepared by the executive committee of the Rockne Memorial which every alumnus should find of importance.) 
Since 1920, Notre Dame has grown rapidly and steadily in every proper direction of higher education. 
Plant, personnel, enrolment, curric­ulum, and supplementary details have been built to a newer, larger scale, retaining the spirit of Notre Dame through it all, and bringing constant­ly increasing prestige to Notre Dame men.. 
Since 1921, when the first appeal was made by Notre Dame for funds to outside friends and alumni, gifts and bequests have amassed at Notre Dame slightly under $1,900,000 in endowment, scholarship funds, and special funds of various kinds. 
With this comparatively small total financial resource, Notre Dame has nevertheless brought itself into the forefront of Catholic education, and has taken its place among the leading American universities. 
From reactions to the Rockne Me­morial campaign, friendly in them­selves but uninformed and a handicap to the progress of the Memorial and the University, it becomes evident that a little more emphasis must be placed on the need for financial sup­port if this place in the sun which Notre Dame has won is to be main­tained. 
Most graphic emphasis this month is a set of statistics compiled by the John Price Jones Corporation, show­ing the gifts and bequests made to some half hundred American educa­tional institutions from July 1, 1920, to June 30, 1937— the same period during which Notre Dame has done an outstanding job not of keeping pace but of gaining steadily on the leaders. A few examples are selected, largely those schools with whose grad-

Don't overestimate the football gate receipts, even this year. ATH­LETICS RETURN ONLY 18% OF THE UNIVERSITY INCOME ANNUALLY. 
uates Notre Dame men most frequent­ly mingle, and with whom we so fre­quently compare notes. In seventeen years: 
Cornell received $28,194,455 Dartmouth i» 15,495,515 Harvard rf 131,231,116 M.LT. it 18,695,308 Princeton )t 22,433,074 Yale t) 156,158,941 Stanford tr 10,486,580 Chicago " 79,254,801 
Minnesota, a state university, re­ceived in addition to state appropria­tions, $13,029,261, in gifts and be­quests from private sources. 
Surely, from the above figures, it is obvious why a few of the gilt-edge features which our alumni are asking, quoting contemporary schools as their sources, are still lacking at Notre Dame. 
And surely it is obvious why Notre Dame, even with its enrolment, with 
The University spends as much ANNUALLY on student employ­ment as the total amount sought for the Rockne Memorial fro m alumni, §200,000. 
its endowment, and vdth its atheltic receipts enjoyin g a comparatively good season, must seek additional aid. 
The miracle of Notre Dame's de­mands is their modesty. Particularly is this so in the face of achievement. 
Last year, and this year. Presidents William E. Cotter and Ambrose A. O'Connell have outlined to you these facts in various graphic form. 
We had hoped that the position of the University in the solicitation of funds for the Rockne Memorial was clear. 
Circumstances i n.d i c a t e that the program of education of our alumni is far from complete. 
We believe that you have, as you have always had, the real spirit of Notre Dame. 

But when only 2% of our Notre Dame men contribute to a Memorial of the nature and the purpose of the Memorial to Rnute K. Rockne, in the height of a season that has made him live again gloriously in the minds and hearts of all America, we believe that something is wrong. 
Campaign Consolations 

Not all of the outlook of the Kockne Memorial is as gloomy as the figures indicate. 
Brightest spot, in one sense, and most embarrassing from the alumni standpoint, is the work of the so-called Civic Committees, albeit there has been a happy participation by some of our well knomi alumni in these groups. 
In the St. Joseph Valley, in New York, and in Chicago, to date, there has been, in addition to the work of the Alumni Clubs there, the organiza­tion of a committee of prominent citi­zens, alumni and friends of Notre Dame who are not alumni, to solicit larger contributions from their own ranks and from personal friends of the committee members known to be friendly to Knute Rockne and the University. 
In all three instances the Civic Committee chairmen have been alum­ni— E. M. Morris, '06, in South Bend; Grattan Stanford, '04, in New York, and Arthur J. Hughes,- '11, in Chicago. But sharing the glory of achievement in all three Committees have been men who never attended Notre Dame, but who have willingly and with enthusiasm given not only of their resources, but of their time and effort, to reach the several goals. 
Our Organization Improved 

Considering the fact that this is the first major organization responsibility given to the District Governors, re­
Forty-nine American college s and universities, from 1920 to 1937, received total gifts of $538,089,355, an average of approximately $11,­000,000 each. Notre Dame received, in gifts and bequests, less than $2,000,000. 
suits so far indicate that we are mov­ing ahead encouragingly in the field 

of organization mechanics. With only FROM THE PRESIDENT . . . 
two or three exceptions, the 22 Dis­trict Governors, and in most cases their Lieutenant-Governors, hava co­operated actively in the work of dis­tributing the assignments of the cam­paign. 
It is not so surprising, but it is most stimulating, to have the major­itj' of the Local Alumni Caubs, re­spond actively to the demands of the drive. 
From the angle of intensifying our organization and motivating our offi­cers, we will emerge from this work vastly improved, on the basis of pres­ent indications. 
Our records will be greatly im­proved as a result of the mailing of the Memorial folder to ever}' non­

graduate as well as graduate on our list. Ob%'iously, in the non-graduate category, there were many errors in address, as this was the first general mailing sent to this group in several years. The indulgence as well as the assistance of the officers throughout the country in checking and correct­ing these errors has been asked by the -A^lumni Office. 

The Sine Qua Non 
But in the last analysis, the meas­ure of the success of a campaign is not its enthusiasm, not its inches of newspaper publicity, not its radio ap­peals, not its number of active work­ers, not the merit of its appeal, not the by-products such as the building of records and the engendering of permanent good-will. 
The success of the drive is meas­ured by the figures that follow the ?.

The magnificent work that has been done by Elmer Layden and the Notre Dame team upon the gridiron has brought added distinction and pres­tige to every Notre Dame man throughout the nation. Their success in playing a most difficult schedule and in overcoming tremendous odds has meant a great deal to us in our daily lives. In business and profes­sional life and in our social contacts we have all felt the benefit of the vic­tories of our team. There is no one who is not happy to stand out and proclaim himself a Notre Dame man. 
The good fathers and brothers at the University also have been doing for us in the field of education what Elmer and his boj's are doing for us on the football field. The inspired work of Father O'Hara and those as­sociated with him at Notre Dame has established the University as one of America's foremost institutions of ed­ucation. All of us who have had the good fortune to attend Notre Dame share in the ever-increasing glory of our Univtrsitj', and I take this occa­sion on behalf of the Notre Dame -4Iumm -Association and myself to ex­press to Father O'Hara, to the priests and brothers at Notre Dame, to Elmer Layden, and to the members of his squad our heartiest congratulations and our gi-ateful appreciation for all they are doing and have done for us. 
Let us not bi-eak faith with them. 
respond in anji;hing like the propor­tions of the 2% who have volunteered at the first call, the Memorial would be fittingly free from further obliga­tion. It is not now a nebulous thing, but a grand and majestic part of the campus where Knute Rockne studied, lived, played, taught, and contributed so brilliantly to Notre Dame that for years his work has carried a burden for Notre Dame that would otherwise have most certainly been ours. 
So why don't you sit down, now, and write out a check, or fill in that pledge card. Don't send in 55 cash if you think it will mean as much as §1 or $2 each month for a year. There's a little more red tape to the deferred payments, but this is one in­stance where the bird in the hand theory doesn't hold. We need an av­erage of §10 from every N. D. man. It is doubtful if 50% will respond. That means an average of §20 from each responding alumnus. And since many are giving smaller amounts, that means a large number of gifts are necessary from §25 and §50 up. 
As the folder said, do not only your share, but the share of some 
N. D. man who perhaps wants to give and can't. 
Let us do our part in maintaining and increasing the prestige of our -Alma Mater. Let's help them carry the torch of Christian education for the benefit of our countrj'. 
We have a simple but definite man­ner in which we may cooperate at this veiY time. For years Notre Dame has been handicapped by the lack of adequate facilities for the physical and recreational developments of the rank and file of her students. De­pending on us, the authorities of the 
•University have gone ahead with the 
PRESIDENT O'CONNELL 
erection of the Rockne Field House which will meet all these require­ments. As designed, the building will be the center of interhall athletics. The minimum- cost of the Memorial is estimated at §550,000 of which ap­proximately §350,000 has already been accounted for. -A. further sum of §200,000 is needed if the structure is to be completed. 
This is where we come into the pic­ture. Our help is needed in raising these funds. If each of us will do his bit wholeheartedly, the money can be raised. I am verj' proud of the work that many of our .Alumni Clubs have already done in this connection. If j'ou have not been contacted through your Alumni organization, you will be; and when you are approached, am satisfied you will do the best you possibly can in the promotion of this splendid enterprise. You vAW be offer­ing a ti-ibute to the immoi-tal Rock and yon will be helping in a most worthy and laudable project.

Sapientis Est Ordinare 
The World Today Needs ihe Work of the Wise Man 
By Francis E. McMahon, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Philosophy 
"It pertains to the wise man to put things in order." Aristotle first said this. Saint Thomas Aquinas repeated it. To put things in order is to put them in their proper places. The op­posite of wisdom is folly. The wise man brings about order; the fool pro­duces chaos. If there is chaos in mod­em life today, then the fool is at work. • To get rid of the chaos the first need is the formation of wise men.' 
What is wisdom? It is a form of knowledge. It is not ordinary knowl­edge, though the wise man must be a man of common sense. It is not what is ordinarily meant by science, though the wise man is scientific in a very profound sense. Ordinary knowledge is largely about facts, and is acquired in a fragmentary fashion. Scientific knowledge is chiefly about causes, and is acquired in a methodical fashion. Wisdom is the knowledge about the ultimate causes of things. The wise man, therefore, is he who contem­plates the totality of things in the light of their ultimate foundations. The wise man "sees life steadily and sees it whole." 


Concerning Superficial Order 

Why sapientis est ordinare? Be­cause only he who contemplates the tohole knows where the part in the last analysis belongs. It is true enough that superficial order may be brought out by the fool. But super­ficial order is fundamental disorder. There is superficial order under the lash of a tyrant or a dictator. There may be superficial order in a college curriculum. In these and other in­stances where the direction of t/ue wisdom is or may be despised the latent chaos is bound to become man­ifest after a time. 
There are three, and only three, 

forms of Wisdom. All forms must .he present and operative in a given society if order and peace, which is merely the tranquillity of order, are to prevail. The almost complete ab­sence of any of these forms of Wis­dom in modem life accounts for the rampant chaos in the different fields of human endeavor. The fool for the time being has triumphed. There is no reason to believe, however, that 
his triumph will be perpetual. 
The three forms of wisdom are Metaphysics, Sacred Theology, and Mystical Wisdom (the gift of the 

(Heprintcd from the De Paul University News) 
Holy Ghost). The least noble form is metaphysics. The metaphysician, by the light of reason alone, analyzes the nature of the universe about him, and ascends to a consideration of its first cause, God. The object of his study is Being, and the ultimate cause of Being, Though the lowest among the types of Wisdom, metaphysics, by the reason of the dignity and univer­sality of its object, is necessarily su­perior to every form of science. The fool disdains metaphysics, and be­lieves that order can be effected with­out it. It is a manifestation of fool­ishness to believe that science can by itself alone bring about order in hu­man life. 
Theology's Proper Object God 

About the wisdom of philosophy is the •wisdom of supernatural theology. It is supernatural, because its princi­ple is the infused virtue of Faith. Theology has for its end the concep­tual analysis of revealed truths and the deduction of other truths virtual­ly contained in the data of Revela­tion. Its proper object is God, the ultimate cause, and therefore it is ^visdom. 
Theology is a higher wisdom than 




ROCKNE MEMORIAL FUND 
Lack of space on pages 76 and 77, devoted largely to the acknowledg­ment of contributions to the Rockne Memorial Fund, prevented the inclu­sion of several explanatory notes. 
James M. Cleary, Chicago, gave a total of $100 in November. Of this amount, $80 was to be credited to a previous most generous pledge to the Fund and $20 was included in the November entries as officially printed. 
Similarly, Robert V. Dunne, '26, San Francisco, contributed a gener­ous $100 in November. Of this, $6 was paid on a previous pledge and $94 entered as a new pledge. 
Arch Ward, '21, a member of the Civic Committee in Chicago, not only raised well over $2,000 among his friends for the Fund, but he himself gave $50 in November, of which $35 was a new contribution. 
To all of these (and others not so far listed) the officers of the Rodcne Memorial Association express special thanks. A second contribution to the Fund is an evidence of particular loyalty to Notre Dame and Rock. 
Metaphysics, because it studies God not merely in so far as He is know­ahle through creatures, but in so far as He is known only to Himself, an intimate knowledge communicable to others only by Revelation. The theo­logian knows God as God, in His very Deity or in His intimate life, God as the author of grace and of eternal beatitude, an object of knowledge essentially supernatural. 
Theology is the complement of philosophy, as grace is of nature. The one (Theology) draws its first principles from Revelation; the other draws its from nature. Philosophy primarily ascends, from man and na­ture to their Creator: theology pri­marily descends, from the Creator and Redeemer to creature. 
There is a third wisdom, the su­preme wisdom of life. It is the wis­dom of the saints, the gift of the Holy Ghost, the gift of Wisdom. Founded on infused Charity it ac­cords its possessor a quasi-experi­mental knowledge of God. It enables him not merely to assent to the truth of the revealed mysteries but to re­gard them as sovereignly good and worthy of love. St. Catherine of Si­ena was endowed fulsomely with this form of wisdom. She brought order about in the Church. St. Joan of Arc also possessed it in rich measure. She brought order about in Prance. Maritain believes that the teachings of St. Augustine were largely the fruit of this highest wisdom. 
Putting the Cart First 

From the viewpoint of practical ordering of human affairs. Theology is the most important form of wis­dom. In a state of pure nature, the natural wisdom (metaphysics) would have sufficed for intellectual perfec­tion and the effecting of order (through Ethics). But man has been elevated to the supernatural order. Intellectual and moral perfection now require a higher wisdom. The de facto supernatural order demands an ethics which is supematuralized, a fusion with theology.

"nOEN IN OTTAWA, Illinois, ^vith­
•^ in a few months of each other, classmates in law at Notre Dame as well as roommates, close friends through all the years, Harry Kelly, Detroit, and John Cassidy, Peoria, both of the class of 1917, were at al­most the same time chosen for two 
SECRETARY OF STATE KELLY, '17 
of the highest offices in their respec­tive states. Harry was elected secre­tary of state in Michigan on Novem­ber 8. Two weeks later, John was appointed attorney general of Illinois by Governor Henry Homer to fill a vacancy. 

The parallel lines in their lives didn't end at Notre Dame. Both of the student lawyers left the campus in the spring of 1917 to enlist in the first Officers' Training Camp, Fort Sheridan, Illinois, both were there commissioned as lieutenants and both were sent overseas for active service in the World War. Harry fought in the battles of Belleau Wood and Cha­teau Thierry and, in the latter, suf­fered the loss of a leg. He received the Distinguished Service Cross and the Croix de Guerre for gallantry in action. John participated in every major combat of the American Expe­ditionary Forces and was wounded in the second Meuse-Argonne Drive. Upon being mustered out in 1919, he was awarded the decoration of the Purple Heart, given only to wounded soldiers. 
Harry returned to Ottawa in 1918 to serve a four-year term as state's attorney. In 1922 he followed his father and his brother to Detroit to form the legal firm of Kelly, Kelly & Kelly. There, in 1930, he was ap­pointed assistant prosecuting attorney and, in 1935, he was named Detroit manager of the Michigan Liquor Control Commission. In the primaries of 1938 he served as Wayne County 
Frank Oberkoetter Studios 
ATTORNBY GENEBAL CASSIDV, '17 
campaign manager for Governor-elect Fitzgerald of Michigan. 
Always intensely enthusiastic and active in Notre Dame affairs Harry was elected president of the Notre Dame club of Detroit in 1930 and is at present a trustee of the club. In 1937-38, he was first vice-president of the Alumni Association. He and his wife (the former Anne O'Brien of Detroit) are the parents of four boys 
(including seven-year old twins) and one girl. 
John began his law practice in Chicago in the legal department of the Aetna Life Insurance Company and, in 1920, was transferred to Pe­oria by the company. He began a private practice of law in Peoria in 1921 and has continued successfully in that field since then. He was, in 1932, a delegate to the Democratic national convention and, in 1934, was appointed director of the National Emergency Council in Illinois. 
Like Harry Kelly, John has always been in the forefront of Notre Dame activities and has been one of the leading figures in the Notre Dame Club of Peoria. He is at present lieu­tenant-governor of District 16 of the Almnni Association. He and Mrs. Cassidy, formerly Susan Casey of Peoria, are the parents of four boys and three girls. 
Where do the parallel lines diverge? Harry is a Eepublican and John is a Democrat. 
•r\.\VID WORTH CL.A.IIK,'22, Boise, ^ is the new United States senator from Idaho after serving two terms as congressman from the second Idaho district. Previously, in 1933-34, Worth was assistant attorney general in his home state. 
Research brings to light many in­teresting things about Senator-elect Clark; throughout his four years at Notre Dame he was prominent in campus activities. An honor student, he was a member of the varsity de­bating team and the Commencement orator for his class. On the social side, he was a member of the Senior Ball committee in 1922 and was ac­tive as well in the guidance of other formal dances. 
Significantly, the class prophet said of him in the 1922 Dome: "To con­centrate an adequate idea of this man's personality and the scope of his duties into the confines of this prophecy is properly the work of a

hydraulic press rather than of a very himian pen. Worth has the faculty of making and holding friends. We are certain that the '22 alumni will

include among them the first man of the land, Mr. Justice Clark, or some­thing of that nature." 
Worth attended Harvard Law School after leaving Notre Dame and was married to Virgil Irwin, of Tulsa. 
G
OVERNOR-ELECT OF NEVADA is Edward P. "Ted" Carvilie, '09, one of the most devoted and generous of Notre Dame alumni, and, inciden­tally, one of three Notre Dame men in his whole state. 
Within three years after finishing his law course on the campus, the young Attorney Carvilie was district attorney of Elko County, Nevada. He served in that office for six years. In 1926 he became district judge for the fourth judicial district of Nevada and, in his eight years on the bench, dis­posed of, with distinction, some of the state's most important problems. He was United States attorney for Ne­vada from 1934 until June of this year and in the discharge of his fed­eral duties won the special commenda­tion of Attorney General Cummings. 
Governor-elect Car\'ille was gover­nor of District 20 of the Alumni Asso­ciation in 1935-36. He was married, in 1910, to Irma Callahan and there

are three Carvilie sons. One of the sons, Edward, was a student at Notre Dame in 1930-32.

INCENT F. HARRINGTON, '25, Sioux City, was returned to Con­gress in the November 8 elections and vdll again represent the ninth district of Iowa. He was elected for the first time in November, 1936. 
After a student life of prominence at Notre Dame where he was a lead­ing guard in the Four Horsemen era of football, Vince was athletic director 
CONGBESSMAN HAKRINGTOJf, '25 
and instructor at the University of Portland, Portland, Oregon, for two years. He returned to Sioux City in 1927 as vice-president and general manager of the Continental Mortgage Company. From 1932 to 1936 he served as state senator in three ses­sions of the Iowa Senate. He was nominated for lieutenant-governor of Iowa on the Democratic ticket in the June, 1936 primary, but later with­drew to run for Congress. 
Vince was married to Catherine O'Connor, of Homer, Nebraska, in 1929 and he is the father of two daughters. He has been consistently a leading figure in Sioux City affairs. He was author, in 1931, of a pamphlet entitled The Tax Tangle in loioa. 
XJOBERT A. GRANT, A.B. '28, 
LL.B. '30, South Bend, was, on November 8, electe d congressman from the third district of Indiana on the Republican ticket after a close battle with another Notre Dame at­torney fro m South Bend, George Beamer, '29, Democrat. 
Bob was bom in Bourb'on, Indiana, attended grade school in Hamlet, In­diana, and high school in South Bend. He is a member of the law firm of Voor (Bill, '25), Jackson and Grant. He has served as deputy prosecutor of St. Joseph County, as well as fed­eral conciliation commissioner for the county under the Farm Act. The commissioners of St. Joseph County named him as county representative on the local licensing board. 
An active member of the First Methodist Episcopal Church in South Bend and a former officer of the South Bend Union of Epworth Leagues, Bob is also well known as a 32nd degree Mason. One of the University's lead­ing musicians in his student days.

the economic, social and political spheres. Should we be surprised, moreover, at Maritain's outburs t against the educators, the psycholo­gists, the economists, and others who conduct their work in complete indif­ference to the theachings of theology? 
It is excedingly foolish to minimize the importance of Theology in a Catholic university curriculum. Un­fortunately, as these curricula today are generally constituted, the stu­dents in these universities acquire a very superficial acquaintance with it. It is not organically related with phi­losophy, and frequently is studied be­fore philosophy. This is putting the cart first. Catholic education will suffer as long as this foolish situation obtains. 
In conclusion, one would like to recall the phrase of Maritain, one of the most eminent of living thinkers, that the pressing need of the age is "the resurrection of metaphysics and a new expansion of charity." This is only another way of saying that a re­turn to wisdom is needed.above all today. That return will be insured when the great body of our Catholic college graduates will possess as their vade mectim the supreme literary in­carnation of the three wisdoms, the Summa Theologica of St. Thomas Aquinas. Thomas possessed to an un­surpassed degree the three wisdoms of philosophy, theology, and of mysti­cism. There is no safer or more in­telligent guide.

CAMPUS NOTES 
PURELY SMOKE 
When the doldrums hit the campus about this time every year comes in­evitably the flock of rumors that everyone sincerely believes and spreads and forgets. In the short time that has elapsed since September we have heard the following: three extra days at Thanksgiving; only Monogram men will be admitted to the Rockne Memorial. But last month saw a juicy bit floating through the air and into ears that would do credit to a Paul Bunyan. As reported by the Scholastic's "Week," Bill Donnel­ly, Queen's Village, New York, it went like this: 

"1. The E. J. Eej-nolds Tobacco Company has offered to pay the ex­penses of every student for a trip to the Pacific Coast for the Southern California game on condition that the migration be entitled 'The Camel Car­avan' and that it be used for the pub­licity purposes of the company. 
"2. The Universitj- authorities have accepted the offer. 

"3. LATE PLASH 'Camel Caravan' report further verified with the added information that the method of trans­portation is to be a flotilla of air­planes flying in the formation of a huge ND." 
And the final report on the affair was that if the Camel people wouldn't do it the Marijuana people would. 
THE BEST 
According to a poll conducted by a member of the Scholastic staff Ted Husing topped all other broadcasters for the position of favorite sports ob­server. Far behind were Red Barber and Bill Stem, and still farther be­hind were Bob Elson and South Bend's Lee Douglass, 
CRITICISM 
Members of the Glee Club, recently streamlined, reorganized, and with a new director, were highly indignant at a review of their two concerts car­ried in the Scholastic. Proclaimed the reviewer: "Neither improvement nor retrogression was noted. . . ."

STAGNATION 
Club activity on the campus this year has been almost stagnant. In times past the Scholastic carried what amounted to two or more columns of news about city or state clubs. This year it is an occasional issue which mentions anything about club doings and the reason is that the clubs just aren't doing. George O'Neil's Met club has been the least offender, hav­ing run through a golf tournament, a Communion breakfast and a few other activities. But with the excep­tion of this group and possibly one or t^vo others there is decay and death among groups; from what we can gather most of them haven't even held a meeting right up to the time of this writing.

WOMEN 
Competing with the Mar.x Brothers (whose version played at the Palace at the same time) the University Theatre presented that grand old drama "Room Service," complete with ice-bags, under^vear, moose-heads, and real women, at two performances, No­vember 22 and 23. Audience recep­
tion was astounding — in the good sense. 
Jerry Hogan, Brooklyn's gift to the "drammer," played the lead while Miss Barbara Southard put up with him for three acts. Walt Hagen, De­troit, "wowed" the boys with his stuffed owls, strip act, and cigar. Others in the cast were Miss Gertrude Krause; Vernon Witkowski, Detroit; Vincent Doyle, Brooklyn; Bill Cotter, New Rochelle, New York; John Cop-pinger, Brooklyn; Tom Teamey, Chi­cago; Robert Blake, Canton, Ohio; Erwi n Stefanic, Chicago; William Mulvey, Erie, Pennsylvania; and John Collins, Brooklyn. 
WILES WILL WIN 

It will be Morrissey vs. Alumni in the finals of the interhall debate league at St. Mary's. Morrissey, coached by Frank Fitch, Cherokee, Iowa, consisting of Tom Grady, Far­mer City, Illinois; Jack Walsh, Chi­cago; and Fred HoU, Honesdale, Pennsylvania, will be somewhat at a disadvantage because the Alumni boys are coached by Bob AVeaver, Coshoc­ton, Ohio's, gift to the Religious Bul­letin, who has had some six pear's ex­perience with what goes on across the road, and who threatens to bring women's wiles into play to aid his boys: John Wintermeyer, Kitchener, Ontario, Canada; George Neumann, Chicago; and Charles Colgan, Buenos Aires, Argentina. 
SLICKER 

One of the boys in Alumni Hall had a bright idea about a week ago; a very bright idea indeed, well planned and cleverly carried out. Said senior has a "one and only" at Phoenix, Ari­zona, and to play a cute prank on her enlisted the aid of the football team. On the way out to the disillusioning Saturday afternoon at Los Angeles, they were to drop off letters to give her the impression he was en route to the game. 
But the team stopped a few days at Tucson, Arizona, and there was a real problem. But our hero was equal to it Fearing that the girl might drive over to Tucson, he had one of the managers send a wire telling her that he had been called directly to Los An­geles. 
Everything rosy, the clever lad sat back to await the acknowledgment of his genius. It came all right. Satur­day morning he was handed a tele­gram from the girl: "Received your Tucson wire stop am in Los Angeles stop where are you?" 
Now he's looking for a nice spot in the East where he can spend the Christmas vacation.

stage of the season if his team had heart, the kind of heart that brings warriors back from the jaws of de­feat to victory. Notre Dame had nev­er been behind when it went into the Army game. But Army proved a wil­ling testing ground, taking the open­ing kiekoff on the goal line and marching to a touchdown without los­ing the ball. Notre Dame scored on a Bob Saggau-to-Earl Brown pass, but Army's first extra point in 13 years and 13 attempts still left the Cadets ahead, 7 to 6, as the fourth quarter opened. And don't let anyone tell you the Cadets overpowered the Irish. Array used its second team eight min­utes of the second quarter while the Irish No. ones were still in there. But Sheridan fooled Army momentarily on a fake pass and ran 30 yards to the one-yard line, then plunged over for the winning score. ShorSy later, Joe Thesing, who made 133 yards in 14 trips for his best day in two years of varsity fullbacking, got away for 47 yards and the clincher. Final: Notre Dame, 19; .\rmy, 7. 
These peculiar 1938 Irish stalled around for 20 minutes in the Navy game before deciding to go to work. Then Saggau entered the game at left halfback, and he and Zontini im­mediately launched a drive which carried for 80 yards, Saggau making the final 16. Later Notre Dame re­covered a Middie fumble on the 16­yard line, and Thesing punched the ball across in easy stages. George Rassas, No. 3 left end, batted down a Navy pass in the closing minutes in the end zone for the safety that made it 15 to 0. 
Came the Big Three: Minnesota, Northwestern, and Southern Califor­nia—and we do mean BIG. The Irish had the speed and precision to offset Minnesota's size in the first of the three. Zontini went 84 yards on a perfect play, Johnny Kelly taking the safety man from his right end position, with the game less than five minutes old. With seconds left of the first half, Saggau unleased' a long pass to Earl Brown for another per­fect play—Brown was in the clear by nearly 10 yards. Then with sec­onds left of the final quarter Saggau pitched another one to Kelly for a touchdown, and it was 19 to 0. 
Notre Dame began to lose its edge against Northwestern, which over­matched the Irish in reserve strength. But Bill Hofer, husky senior quar­terback who had been trying for three years, finally had his big day. He carted an intercepted pass back 65 yards behind clean-up blocking to FOOTBALL 
"Should Notre Dame slip past its first two or three games without a defeat, it will be a hard team to beat."—ALUMNUS, October, 1938. 
Well, as you know from the public prints and from the very able review of the early season by Bill O'Toole, '39, in the November issue, the boys did slip by the first two or three games. And you also know by now that they were veiy hard to beat the 
rest of the way so hard that the season came right down to the last game before U. S. C. was able to turn the trick, 13 to 0. 
Confidence was what the 1938 Irish needed more than anything. They got a fair share of this import­ant ingredient by licking a strong Kansas team, 52 to 0, in one of those snow-balling openers. 
Then came the 14 to 6 victorj- over Georgia Tech, when mistakes of in­experience were numerous, but not too numerous for a touchdo^\^l ­minded Layden team to overcome. The Ramblin' Wrecks, celebrating their 50th anniversary, were a scrap­py team, the aggressor all the way, and a team that ordinarily would get the breaks. But a fair amount of luck smiled on the Irish—Lou Zontini 
Orchids to the coaching gentlemen Elmer Layden, head coach; Chet Grant, Joe Boland, line coach. 
intercepted a pass and Jue Gubanich blocked a punt and twice Notre Dame got the ball on Tech's 43, punching it over in short order. 
Notre Dame lightning struck twice to defeat Illinois, 14 to 6, when Har­ry Stevenson passed to Earl Brown for 35 yards after five minutes of play, and when.little Ben Sheridan carried an Illini punt back 68 yards. 
Nobody would believe it at the time, but Carnegie Tech was the toughest opponent faced by Notre Dame all season, and the Irish came out of that one the victors by 7 to 0. Tech was undefeated and untied ex­cept for the Notre Dame game, and will beat Texas Christian in the Or­ange Bowl, Jan. 2. There is no addi­tional charge for this information. There are those who say Notre Dame was lucky to beat Tech, be­cause of some confusion on the num­ber of downs late in the game which resulted in the Irish getting the ball on the Tartan 47-yard line. But 47 yards is a long way to go against Carnegie, and the Irish—after wast­ing one play — used three offensive maneuvei^ previously undisclosed and marched to the end zone with Bill Kerr, sub left end, making the final seven yards on an end-around sweep. 
Layden still wanted to know at this put Notre Dame ahead, but North­western forged to the front, 7 to 6, before the half. Then late in the game, Hofer was rushed in to try a placement from the 17-yard line. As John Carmicliael of the Chicago Daily Netvs put it, "Hofer put the Ball game on the end of his toe and boot­ed it into the victory column, 9 to 7." 
Riding high in the No. 1 spot on football's hit parade, the Irish tried to make it unanimous in Los Angeles before a Pacific Coast record crowd of 104,000 fans (plug for the pub­licitj' department.) No kidding, all the seats and eleven aisles were filled. Many factors entered into S.C.'s 13 to 0 victor}', and we shall try to as­suage your sorrow over the outcome with a few "might have beens." 

The Trojans were picked for the Rose Bowl the Monday before the Notre Dame game, in the face of no little criticism from the northern part of the state of California, They were out to prove their right to the bid. Coach Howard Jones said at a lunch­eon during the week "I am trying to impress my boys with the necessity of stopping that 'one play' that Notre Dame.has been able to work for vic­tory all season." And to do this, he sent on to the field as demonical a group of taclders as these eyes have ever seen. Shoestring or shoulder or jersey tackles—^they served their pur­pose. Southern California had all the size of Minnesota and Northwestern, and twice the speed. 
• The Irish had been outldcldng the opposition all year and Southern Cal­ifornia had kicked poorly all season —^but the tables were turned on Dec. 3. Notre Dame had been the oppor­tunists all year, but in that game Southern CaUfomia took advantage of two breaks to win. Let's consider that much - discussed fourth down running play for which Quarterback Steve Sitko has been taking so much abuse. There were 35 seconds left to play and Saggau might have got loose for the necessary 23 yards to enable Notre Dame to control the ball. Southern California had made only three first downs in 29 minutes and there was no reason to suppose the Trojans could eat up 37 yards in a couple of plays. Had Saggau stayed inside time would have gone on, and there would have been time for only one play, but he was knocked out by Trojan tacklers and the clock stopped. 
S.C. was piled up on a running play, and took time out to stop the clock. An incomplete pass stopped it again. Then came the pass from OUie Day to Krueger that put S. C, ahead. Zon­tini tackled Krueger on the five-yard line, and there are those who say the latter slid across the goal line and that the ball should have been dead, with three seconds left on the clock, on the two-yard line. It would have been unfortunate to invoke such a technicality—and we'll abide by the The Notre Dame Alumnus 
officials' judgment all the way. Tien, when Notre Dame took the kickoff, Saggau was loose except for one Tro­jan, Mickey Anderson, who might have been knocked down by one No­tre Dame blocker had the latter been so minded—and Notre Dame might have gone ahead, 7 to 6, at this stage; 
Southern California got its second touchdown after recovering Milt Ke­pul's fumble on the Notre Dame 35. The Trojans simply punched their way through the second string line to eat up the yardage necessary. But 
COACH BILL CEBNEY His "B" team wos undefeated. 

let's not censure Piepul, who turned in some grand ball games for the Irish this year, and committed only that one fumble all season. 
Notre Dame could have come back into the game in the closing minutes —^and it's been done before — after marching to the Trojan 16 from the Irish 32. Here Saggau was rushed on a pass and he threw to Brown in the end zone when Sitko was wide open on the five-yard line. This is not to be taken as criticism of Saggau or anyone else, for he was rushed, and-he played a beautiful game from start to finish. These are just—as we said—some of the might-have-beens. 
In short, Notre Dame was beaten by a team that was better on that particular day, although the lads in­sist that Carnegie Tech and North­western were both tougher football teams. The Trojans deserved to win —we merely want to point out how Notre Dame might have won, and it was nobody's fault, except Southern California's, that they didn't. The worth of this Trojan team will be proved in the Eose Bowl game against Duke January 2. (Free pre­diction No. 2.) 
Looking toward next year, here's the situation we find: the entire front line with the exception of Jolinny 
December, 1938 
Kelly, right end and captain-elect, lost by graduation. This includes Earl Brown, Ed Beinor, and Ed Longhi, who were ranked all-American; Paul Kell and Augie Bossu on the right side of the line, and Capt. Jim Mc-Goldrick, a great leader and a fine left guard. The backfield loses such frequently seen operators as Hofer and Emmett Crowe at quarterback; Motts Tonelli and Ed Simonich at fullback; Paul Morrison and Max Bumell at right half. These are not the only casualtie.":—only the prin­cipal ones. 
Returning will be the first string backfield — Sitko, Zontini, Thesing and (take your pick) Sheridan, Sag­gau or Stevenson at left halfback. Bill Kerr at left end was only a step or so behind Brown. Gallagher at left tackle got a lot of seasoning and he should give good account of him­self at left tackle. Joe DeFranco and Joe Gubanich, miniature guards, proved their sea-worthiness by sur­viving some of the nation's best pow­er attacks unscathed; Johnny Mcln­tyre has the makings of a great cen­ter; and Tad Harvey at right tackle, was only a shade less efficient than Kell. In fact, he was better than Kell at some stages of the season. 
It looks to this department like next year's biggest problem vnil be getting the lads ready for the opener with Purdue's Big 10 champions-elect (Prediction No. 3—^we really ought to charge you for these). If the Irish can come up to that one ready for anything, then not let down too much for the next three, we say again "they'll be a hard bunch to beat." We personally guarantee victories over Carnegie Tech at Pittsburgh on Oct. 28 and over Southern California at Notre Dame Nov. 25. 
Following is the schedule: 

Sept. 30 Purdue at Notre Dame Oct 7. Georgia Tech at N. D. Oct. 14—Southern Methodist at N, D. Oct 21 Navy at Baltimore Oct 28 Carnegie Tech at Pittsburgh Nov. 4 Army at New York Nov. 11 Iowa at Iowa City Nov. 18 Northwestern at N. D. Nov. 25....SO. CALIFORNIA at N. D. 
A word about this department's favorite topic, the box office. Notre Dame played to total crowds in ex­cess of 500,000 to top all other teams in the country in a nine-game sched­ule. There were sellouts at Atlanta, New York, Balitimore, Evanston, and Los Angeles, as well as at Notre Dame for the Minnesota game. 
The Frank G, Dickenson system ranked Notre Dame No. 1 in the country, and the good professor per­sonally presented Coach Layden with the Rockne Memorial trophy at the

BUFFALO 
Carlos H. Frank. '33, 232 Barton Street, Pre^dent; Ralph F. Else, '34, 278 Voorhees Avenue. Secretary. Our reeular October meeting was held in 

the Bohemian Room of the University Club where our guests were Father HuRh O'Donncll. vice-president of the University, and Jim Armstrong, our secretary. We thoroughly en­joyed having both of these men with us. Father O'Donnell spoke of the Rockne 3tle­mori.i] and imported much new information as to where the various monies taken by the University are spent. Needless to say the football pictures o{ the Notre Dame-Minnesota game were a sure fire hit. 
President Carl Frank appointed the follow­ing men as a committee to assist in the Rockne Memorial Drive: Gord Bennett, Hank Bams, JiAnnie Byrne, Bill Cass, Frankie Cass, George Doyle. Ralph Else. Don Love. Bob Moore, Mike Shecdy, Li Smith and Marty Travers. 
Jim Britt, whom we have come to took upon as one of our group, was also present and consented to say a few words. Incidentally, Jim. since leaving South Bend has been go­ing over in great style in the East, having broadcast a national football game over the network every Saturday. Jim broadcast the Notre Dame-Army game. 
The Football Excursion to the Army game, sponsored by the Buffalo Club, went over the top and was a Sell-out. Approximately 80 alumni and friends took advantage of the trip. The club was enabled to realize a iinancial return from this trip. 
We (editorially) saw Joe Vangban while in 
Ex-Officio Director to 1939

Drive. The oITicers hope his words had the desired effect Nevertheless, they are asking all the alumni to get their pledge cards in at once. 
Some alumni that we haven't seen much of lately were out. Most of them rushed in so fast that the secretary couldn't get a line on them. 
AVc did spot Nick Ambrosa, Bill Branigan. Bill Kearney, Ed Herlihy, Elmo Moyer, Leon> srd Mayer, Nick Tancredi. Al Roche, Jchn Campbell. Bill Fitzpatrick, Joe 6'Kane, and Frank Mahar. 
To prove that the test Inid plans go awry just consider that Nick Tancredi and Dan Cunha didn't win the Football Trophy. Chris­tian Brothers Academy is the 1938 winner of the Rockne award. 
Joe O'Kane has started Catholic Central High School of Troy back to the football wars. We understand that they will be competing for the Rockne Trophy next fall. 
Louis Orgera of Troy hopes that his work for the state in Syracuse slackens in time for him to attend the Christmas dance. 
Elmo Moyer has corrected the statement that house cleaning kept him from the outing last summer. The stork does not respect outing dates. Elmo's third child is named Nancy Ann. Elmo also was envying Marc Erchner his trip to the Minnesota game. 
The Alinnesota game found all the club steadies grouped in Albany, chuckling as Min­nesota got the first downs and we got the scores. Harold Rhodes almost fell off his chair when Zontini started his long gallop. 
After this broadcast the tickets for the Christmas dance were distributed. A large gathering is expected on December 27 at 
•Wolfert's Roost Country Club when the club members and friends will dance to the tune­ful melodies of Gordie Randall's NBO or­chestra. 
This year, as never before, the alumni are coming together for small parties before the dance. We would like to have every person attending the dance attend one of the small parties where things will be served. 
The students have signified (in writing) that they intend to turn out for the dance. 
This is the big affair of our social year. Let's push i t Mike lading.

Robert C. Streb, '32. 1319 Worley Ave, N.W., President; Georce P. Moloney. Jr.. '31, 922 Sidge Boad. N.W^ SecreUry-

Some time ago. Bob Streb, '32. wrote voa concerning the intention of a group of Notre Dame men to establish a local Alomn! Asso­ciation. I am very happy to say that this thought has become a reality, and the Notre Dame Club of Canton, Ohio, is now a going concern. 
On Thursday*. August 4. the first meeting of the Canton Club of the University of Notre Dame took place. It was held at the Arion Club just outside of town. Some 25 members attended. The party was a great success, and a good time was had by all. Bob Sttch was elected president, and I was elected secretary and treasurer. 
At that time, plana were made to hold a 

dance on th 27th of August at the Orchard Hill Country Club. These plans were com­pleted. Even-one had a fine time, and what's more, we made a little mone>'. 
Today, being the date of the Notre Dame-Southetn California game, arrangements have been made for a radio party to listen to it. For this purpose, we have secured a room at the Garden Grill Restaurant here in Canton. Glen Blake, *35, Glen Dubs, '35, Ray Oakcs, '35, Norm Conley, '36, and Bob Strcb, '32, have done a good job of it.

CHICAGO Francis T. McCnrrie. '27. 8219 S. Sangamon St., President; Edwin Leo Ryan, '27, 111 
W. Wa^ington Blvd., Secretary-The alumni clubs of Xorthwestern and Notre Dame held a joint luncheon on the eve of the Northwestern game. Coach LiTin Waldorf and his assistants attended, and Coach "Waldorf spoke very enthusiastically about Northwestern football relations with Notre Dame. The Hon. John F. O'Connell and President Frank McCurric addressed the group as Notre Dame representatives. Warren Brown did an excellent job as guest speaker. You know Warren predicted a 14 to 7 -w-in for Northwestern, and based his assumption on the fact that the game was to start late in the afternoon and that as darkness grew Jef­ferson, the N.W. colored boy, would get the ball and no one would be able to find him — this camouflage coupled with Jefferson's abil­ity would be the deciding factor. Maj-be War­ren had something there, or maybe he over­looked the fact that Northwestern wears white jerseys. Congratulations to a great team and Elmer Laydcn for pro\-idinB such an ex­
cellent afternoon's performance and a score of adequate size for the benefit of us Chicagoans. 
The \'ictory was celebrated at a dance held at the Steven's Hotel, Saturday night, Novem­ber 19. The official attendance figures are not in yet, and estimates of any^vhere from 500 to 750 couples have been made. Colonel Frank Fehr of Ixiuisville, Kentucky was one of the distinguished guests. The colonel played on the original Notre Dame team of 'S7. He told of defeating Northwestern 9 to 0 in 1BS9, and described the difference between the foot­ball of then and now. It was the first time since 1889 that he had had the pleasure of seeing a Notre Dame-Northwestern game. To make the colonel's day complete, he met and talked with Etmer Layden and a number of the players who were guests at the dance and who contributed greatly to the successful com­pletion of an afternoon and evening. Every­one was pleased to hear a few words from Elmer Layden. Mr. and Mrs. Stuart Irwin (Mrs., the former June Collier of the movies) declared their loyalty to Notre Dame, and in a few words told of the thrills of past Notre Dame performances. Jack Clark -and his as­sistants did an excellent job in arranging the dance and evening's entertainment. Congrat­
ulations, Jack. 
The drive for the Rocknc Memorial is under way among the alumni. Chairman Ed Gonld has -delegated to a number of assistants the names of the alumni to contact by phone or in person, to keep alive the purpose and ac-.. complish the desired financial goal. 
A number of fellows from the Chicago area have been perpetuating the old time evening gatherings as might be held in the rec room of Brownson or Carroll and have been having successful get-togethers. I attended the last one and enclose a report of it as submitted to me. Had a fine evening and only wished it were possible to have more class groups like this. Also more turkeys to win. 
Edwin L. Ryan. 

On Monday, November 21, 193S, a meeting, somewhat unique but nevertheless very inter­esting in the way of Notre Dame affairs, was held at Al Stcpan's home on the north side. A group of local fellows from the classes of 1930 to 1935 were present to enjoy some de­licious baked ham. cheese and Fox De Luxe beer. Very appropriately, a 15-pound turkey was awarded as a door prize. Edwin Ryan, secretary of the Notre Dame Club of Chicago, held the lucky number. Everyone had plenty to eat and drink and certainly appreciated the professional manner in which Ray Fox handled the drawing of the beer. 
These meetings were first held do%vntown at the I-ake Shore Athletic Club and Eitel's Yan­kee Grill, They they were moved to the O'Toole residence on Luella Avenue where they grew tremendously. About 52 fellows were present at our spring meeting. It has been the aim of this group to meet in diflTerent sections of the city with the result that the recent meeting was held at the north side res­idence of Al Stcpan. Neil Huriey has offered the use of his home in River Forest for the meeting on Januarj- 16, 1939. Anyone from out of town who %\ill be in Chicago at that time is welcome to attend. Jim Doyle, Eddie Ryan and Don O'Toole have more or less in­formally arranged for the various meetings from time to time. 
This group, composed of Chicagoans who at­tended Notre Dame at the same time, has been getting together mainly to maintain that friendship and have a chance to talk thinj^ over in a very informal manner. 
Jim Igoc, George Bniutigam. Tigfae Woods, Fran Oelerich and Edwin Ryan, officers of the local club, were guests. Other fellows present were Bill Chawgo, Jack Schmidt, John Sher­man. Bert Metzgcr, Eddie R3-an, Mmuiy Lee, Paul and Don O'Toole, John and Jim O'ShauRhnessy, Fred Beddenberg, Joel Os­trandcr, Walt Roney, Ray Milton and Henry Fox. Al Stcpan, our host.

OELERICH SUPPLEMENT: 
I don't know w^hether I'm Ed Ryan's ghost writer, or merely his stooge, but I'm convinced now that after £d winds up his year as sec­retary of our club, he can become a Broadway columnist. Don't those guys have everybody else furnish their stuff? 
Just want to tell you that not only the var­sity team is winning all of its games this season (I am wTiting this before the Southern California game) but the "Wilmette Wistarias have done all right too. The W a just played their ninth annual Turkey Day Classic against the Oak Park Petunias (touchball, it's called, with tongue in cheek—^you should see It!) and 
we Wistarias whipped them Petunias to the tune of 21-0. Notre Dame was represented with four men on the north siders—Jim Kraf­thefer, Jim Igoe, my brother, Dick, and my­self. Naturally, and as long as you didn't see the game, we four starred. Dick threw the passes, Jim fraught them, Krafthefer made up the plays, and I was our line, being a com­bination of Joe Beinor, Ted Twomey, and Dracula. If Elmer had only seen that mas­sacre I know he'd have invited us along to help him trim the IVojans. Terrj' Dillon was supposed to play with the Petunias, but having seen my muscles in the handball court recently, Terry sneaked off to Hudson, Michi­gan, for Thanksgiving Day. 
Flash! Bill Drennan announces a baby girl, born this morning. It wasn't due for a couple more days, but Bill was anxious to make the deadline of the ALXXMNVS. 
This has nothing to do with our local club, but did you read where Jack "Jlother" Tier­ney's (Howard Hall, '28) young brother has been chosen captain of Princeton's eleven for next year? 
Bill Ziliak is now located in Chicago. I 
never will forget that day at school when Bill 
opened up his weekly copy of the Princeton 
(Ind.) **Bugle," or whatever it was, and there, 
in screaming, double face headlines, were the 
words: "Welcome, Natural Gas. Welcome."

Our Scholarship Fund was increased by more than $100 through the distribution of 16 tickets to the Minnesota game. The fund now totals nearly §600. 
The annual Christmas Scholarship dance will again be held at one of our local country clubs. The location has not been selected to date. The committee in charge of the dance is headed by Walter Nienabcr, chairman. The rest of the committee is composed of Joseph jMorrissey, George Aug, Robert Hughes, Donald Dixon, Richard Shiels and Ray Pell­man. Joseph Moorman will represent the campus on the committee. Proceeds of the dance are placed in the Scholarship Fund. 
The last meeting, held at Kemper Lane Hotel, was attended by several notable alumni such as Botts Crowley, Bob Wilke, 3Iatt Themes, and about 25 others. Dr. J. H. The-sing, father of J€>e Thcsing, was the guest of honor. 
Bob Wilke is the proud father of a baby girl. Her name is Karen Celeste. J. J. An­derson was married early in November. Mr. and Mrs. Anderson will live in Cincinnati. 
Clem Crowe, coach of Xavier University, completed the most successful football season in the history of the school. His team lost two and won seven. In appreciation of his fine showing, the local fans and Xavier alum­ni gave him an automobile and designated the day of the last game "Crowe Day."

Ever since the local group started the pub­lication of "Notes and Dates" your corre­spondent has been heckled each time (he ALUMNUS appears with, "Plagiarist!" and other epithets which we wouldn't print here but which wouldn't be at all out of place in "Notes and Dates." We merely turn the other cheek, and, nothing abashed, retort, "What did Hoover promise in '291" which usually reins our critics do\vn to a canter as they can't figure that one out and don't realize that we can't either. So everyone's happy, thank you. 
So much for that patter. Now we'll just go ahead and copy a few items from "Notes and Dates." Don Knyler has been eneaged for the Christmas dance at the Statler where Joe Fitzgerald, a newcomer to town, is assistant manager in charge of sales promotion. A defi­nite effort has been made to have a different dance — such novelties as harp music during dinner (oh, yes, it's a dinner dance!), the candlelight mentioned before in this column, a Christmas tree, etc., will add to the glamour and to the dignity. Don Kayler will accom­pany the harpist during the dinner from S to 10 and then will lend his 11 piece orchestra foe the dancing from 10 to 2. r>on is an outstanding pianist having performed at the Continental Punch Club and at most of the better country clubs in this area. 
The Rockne Memorial Drive is under way and will be completed before the next issue of this reaches you. Mailing lists have been culled and fastidiously revised. The entire membership is to be divided into small groups which will be contacted by 50 key men. The aims of the Drive were ably presented to those who attended the football dinner No­vember 10 at GuiWhaH by Father HuRh O'Don­ncll, C.S.C. Besides Father O'Donnell, mem­bers iiere priiileged to hear Francis Wallace, author and sports writer. Chairman Don Mil­ler is to be congratulated for the exceptional turnout — about ir»0. as we recall. Bay Miller excelled as m. c. 
A committee is already working on a lunch­eon Januarj' 23 to welcome the members of the basketball squad when they come to Cleve­land to play John Carroll. 
The employment bureau is active and it is hoped that, with improving business conditions, even more openings will be reported to Karl Marterstcck as the success of this venture will do much to further the strength of.the club. 
The scholarship committee, recently an­nounccil. consists of James Dubbs, 5r., as­sistant manager of the Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Company, chairman. Father Moriar­ty, club chaplain, Frank Cull, George Kcr^er» Pat Canny, Clayt Leroux and Prexy Karl. It is anticipated that the committee will select two young men for scholarships at the Uni­versity next year. 
We learn that Ed Mastcrson is studying very hard for his bar examinations in Janu­arj-. Nelson Callahan is working for the 
U.F.C. Chuck Rohr has opened his new eat shoppe and is breaking an old Rohr restaumnt tradition by having dinner music, furnished by Walberg Brown, who. incidentally, for the information of some our rug-cutter friends, is not a swingeroo. Otty Cemey is now assistant secretary of the First Federal Savings and Loan. Pete Champion, honorary president of the club, is easily most active of the "not-ju5t­out-of-college" group. We have two invest­ment trust salesmen, John Waddcn, with of­fices in the East Ohio Gas Building (not a slur) and Ed Comyns. Stan Cofall appeared at the football dinner with both his sons, one of whom was a local high school star, and from all advance indications may duplicate his All-American father's feats. John L- Weiscnd is an attorney in the Swetland Building. .An­other member was added to the club this month—he is James Danehy. Tom Crosby is working at the May Company, and Bill Ripley is with the Chesapeake and Ohio. Frank Savage has returned to Youngstown. Speaking of Youngstown. congratulations to Tom Enright, who was married a week ago in Lakewood. Art Deibe] is selling wholesale hardware supplies, and Charles Rudman is an insurance agent. Phil Doell is in General 
Electric's sales department. 
To get away from the salesmen for a mo­ment. Cletus Schneider is farming in Avon as a hobby. Notwithstanding a very good crop, he made more by not planting com than he did on the rest of his crop which was r - guess I soy beans, Frank Doan is a representative of Crowell Publishing Company, and James Devitt, who managed the campaign of John 
O. McWilliams for mayor, is now in McWil­h'ams' office. Harold Rappel found the Cleve­land Electric Illuminating Company very diffi­cult when he tried to have a pole installed near his new home. Marty Rini was seen at The Cleveland. 
Frank J. Butler is back at work after a' severe cold incapacitated him for almost two weeks. Our engineer friends keep in close touch with each other. Hugh Ball tells us that Paul Abel is in the engineering depart­ment of Yoder Manufacturing Company. 3Iarty , Brennan is contemplating a vacation in Flor­ida when business slackens this winter at Great Lakes Dredge & Dock. (That place must be all Notre Dame graduates). John Colangclo was in Akron until very recently. John is a civil engineer and the job in Akron was com­pleted. We have missed Dr. Anderson at the last few affairs. Frank Belting is quite a lad for detail; he is in charge of inventory at American Steel & Wire and has twin sons. 
George Kozak and Eddy Caldwell had a bet­ter than average season with their John Adams High School team. The Lake Shore Duplicate Club draws most of its membership from our ranks. Bridge players Jim Driscoll, Cy Caldwell, Pat Canny, Joe Gavin, George O'Day. Howie Richards, and Jim Uprichard and their wives (if any) meet at the Lake Shore for what used to be called whist, about once a week. Lee Ryan, Billj-'s brother, was at the football dinner. 
Bachelor Jim Callahan startled many of his friends when he appeared on the first page of the "Cleveland Press" illustrating the typical Cleveland family at the Thanksgiving dinner table. With him were Mrs. Rohr, one of Chuck's children, and two of Jim's sister's children. Tliis was probably the first turkey Jim had ever attempted to car\'e in his life. 
In an organization of 350 members it is al­most impossible to know e^'eryone. Frankly. we don't know more than one-third of the list. If. therefore, you have any information about anyone in the club which you think might be reprinted in this column, don't hesitate to communicate with 
AI I^awfon.

In that nothing has been reported from the Denver group in some time, we don't want you to feel we have been inactive, so I will try and give you the dope for the last few months without making this too long. 
First of all. the club got together on the day of the silver anniversary of the Army game, and we extended an invitation to the different Armp posts in the locality, Ktz­simonds Hospital, the new air school Lowery Field, and Fort Logan. From these we re­ceived seven guests among whom was Col. 
D. I. Sultan. '07, who was the director of athletics at the academy when Notre Dame and Army first met in 1913. On our side we had Fred Gashant, *14, who played on the 
N.D. team along with Rodme, Dorais, Ed> wards. Pliska, and other stars of the 1913 era. Fred has a son now attending West Point, and it was quite uncomfortable for him. I am sure, but at the end I know he was pleased with the outcome. The other boys of our group in attendance were: Leon Ardier. Gene Blisb, Jerry Conners. Floyd Grazier. Dan Gibbs. Jim Hanlon, Jim Logan, Loms Hongfa. Charles Haskell, John Hnmphreys, Dave Rcil­ley, Ed Mansfield, John' McEniery, Bart O'Hara. Al O'Mearm. Jr„ Jack Shechan, Ray Smith, George Starbnck, Tom Ticmey, Presi­dent Bob Dick and myself. All in all, a good time was had. and Col Sultan closed the aff^r with the words, "West Point backs Notre Dame 364 days out of the year. Today you had a better team and you deserved to win. We hope to join you with more of our men in this region next year, and thank you for this very hospitable occasion." 
The annual football trips, sponsored by the 

club met with great success again this year 
bringing the total of fans moved from Denver 
to see Notre Dame teams in the last three 
years to almost a thousand in number. This 
year more of the members of the club made 
the trips than ever before. Ed Mansfield, Jack 
Sheehan. AI O'Mearm. Herb Falrall, Eugene 
Dilullo, Gene Blish, Bob Fox. John Humphreys, 
George Starbnck. Bob Dick and, of course, 
yours truly. The gang had a swell time. 
With the weather and the score both in cur 
favor, all of our boosters were well pleased 
We were in hope that the team would pay 

us a visit on their return trip from the coast, 
but now that we know that they can't we will 
just have to continue to praise them without 
a chance to demonstrate our feelings. 
A few new men have made themselves known to us, Dan Gibbs is now working here in Denver, as is David J. Reilley, formerly of St. Louis. Also received a card from Jim the other day with the name of D. J. Piflaam from Michigan, who is now in our district. I have not had the pleasure of meeting this man as yet.

Congratulations are in order for tveo mem­bers of the Detroit Club for their fine showing in the recent election. Judge Tom Murphy has been returned to the Probate bench, and Harry Kelly is our new secretary of state. 
We are very proud of these gentlemen and wish them both a very successful term. 
Election of officers for 193S-1939 is to be held at the December meeting. Our future meetings will be held at the Hotel Fort Shelby • and a buffet supper will displace the regular dinner-meeting. 
Frank McGinnis, of the R. L. Polk Directory Service, is getting together a directory of the Detroit Club membership. He is including, besides the name and addre§3, the telephone number, business address and type of btisiness the person is engaged in. This information should prove helpful to all our members.

Just a line to let you know that we are all fcickine and tr>-ing to get along. Our club members have been quite active in helping the Catholic Lecture series. Ed SalHvan, '24, our president, has been secretary and treasurer for the past two years, and has always done a good job. I personally have handled the ushers' job, being assisted by Hcnrj- Hum­brecht, and my brother. Paul DeWald. Some of the Notre Dame men attending the lec­tures included Donnelly and Ken McDonald, Henry Haslcy and Pat Donahue. 
Practically the entire Notre Dame Fort AVayne club was present at tho Minnesota game. Everyone was well please*! with the results. The local club was able to raise about Sl.OOO for the Rockne Memorial under the able direction of Donnelly McDonald. 
Several Fort Wayne people went on the Notre Dame-Southern California trip. In fact, a trip was awarded as second prize at our parish (St. Jude's) Fall Festival.

John Alt, secretary; and A, C BlueUer, treasurer. 
The club disposed of sets of tickets and ex­pense money to games played at Notre Dame this fall. This venture made it possible for the club to make a substantial subscription to the Rockne Memorial Fund. 
Tickets have already been distributed to the members for the Christmas Dance to be held in the Pantlind Hotel December 26. This re­newed activity on the part of the reorganized club has stimulated attendance at the club meetings, and we have eveiy reason to look forward to a highly successful year.

\Yc had our first meeting of this fall on November 9 in the Derby Room of the Brown Hotel. 
About 35 or 40 members were present. We hope to have a much larger attendance next meeting, however, as we expect to get our mailing list revised and completed so that we may contact all members. We would appreci­ate it if all those alumni of NJ>. who reside in Louis\-ilIc or vicinity, and who have not been contacted with regard to meetings, would get in touch with us so that we may notify them of our next meeting. 
The Notre Dame - Kentucky U, basketball game, to be held in Louis\'ille in January, promises to be the highlight of the winter season and in order to round out the evening the club is now formulating plans for a dance to follow the basketball game.

We can report an active and eventful sum­

mer "in these parts," with things looking up 
pretty much at this festive time of year. 
A Christmas dance to be held in conjunc­tion with the St. Mary's club of JoHet is ten­tatively planned for around the Christmas and New Year holidays. A committee composed of Joe Adier, Tom Fecly. and Ed King will meet with the St. Mary's club committee soon to make plans for a fine part}'. 
The annual Christmas party held for the children of members and friends will be held the week before Christmas, the plans being discussed at the next monthly meeting. 
Local club members followed the football team almost to a man this season. Don Wise, Tom Fcely and most of the fellows attended the Minnesota game. Bob Duffy. Joe Kirincich, Tom, Don and others saw the Northwestern game in Evanston. Tom Feely and another local group took in the Kansas game. 
A. Very successful Hallowe'en party was held with about 46 people having a "swell" time. Joe Adler. Ed King and Joe Silk ar­ranged a full evening for the guests, -nUh music, dancing, entertainment and a mid­night buffet supper being the features. Clar­ence Wilhclmi and Charley Lcnnon were the ring leaders in comedy for the evening. 
Best wishes of the season to all from the bunch. Larry Dunda.

Since your last issue we have received sev­eral sharp queries from Massachusetts corre­spondents about our illegal tactics in adver­tising weight reducers. It seems that we had described Hcc Garvey, of Holyoke, as weighing 265; in reality he tips the beam at 295. Some­one thought we had another HoUy^vood diet substitute; but Hec's activity here could not have taken much off him. 
Many of the alumni of this district, having taken in the Minnesota and Northwestern tilts, commented as before on the strength of the Big Ten teams. Among those on the football trips were: Barney Qairk, Joe Waller. Bob Fendergast, Frank Tyler, Rich Bowes, Charles Metzler. Sr., Fred Slancaso, Ed SIcGrath. John O'Connor, Sr., Charley Higgins, Ernest Manrin. Jerry Darcy, Ed Rcardon. Dave Crooks. 
November 28 marked the passage of the football special, en route to Los Angeles. About 1,500 alumni, synthetic and bona fide, gathered at the depot to greet the crusading gridders. The train was about three hours late, so the majority went their different ways; but a few of the more enthusiastic crashed the gates at one A.M. and rode the Pullman vestibules while the cars and the sleeping occu­pants were switched back and forth .through the yards. 
Our scout reports the rise of a feared pass­ing combination in the South Side Sunday 
P.M. Touchball League (not affiliated with the A*A.U,): "Flippin' Frank" laen to "Jarrin* Jim" Higgini, ably aided by that sturdy blocker, "Thumpin* Tommy" Higrina. 130 pounds of wildcat. The flicker-footed luen pol­ished bis open field technjaue last spring by skirting CXO. picket lines. Says the con­servative "Summit News" of him: '^ere in­
deed is u man of whalebone and whipcord." Their dub is eagerly awaiting a bid to play New Year's Day in some — or any — Wassail Bowl. 
Notes: Ed Setter, *30, is the parent of a husky son. John Fry, *35, engineering out of Kansas, relates that the Ihjst Bowl hotels try to limit the guests to two baths a week. Larry N^nghton, the former Cleveland Comet, is doing well here in the auto accessory busi­ness. Chet Conklin is also with an engineer­ing outnt here. Norb Sdiwartz is doing yeo­man work on the renewed Rockne Drive out in Salina. Hal Qninlan saw the Dartmouth-Harvard game, and described the New Hamp­shire Indians as sharp and hard-hitting. Fred Wirthman favors a resumption of athletic re­lations with Nebraska. Bit! Dolan is working for a milling firm in Topeka, Kansas. Otto Schmidt, a Notre Dame law man, is a United States assistant district attorney here. 
We trust that the response to our Pan-American Communion was indicative of the success of that important conference in Lima. About 55 members of this club received Com­munion December 11 at the Guardian Anget Church for the success of the United States program there. Kev. John O'Hara, C.S.C. is a member of the United States Commission.

The Milwaukee Notre Dame Club has pur­chased a trophy which will be presented every year to the champion of the Catholic High School football conference. The trophy is named "The Rockne Memorial Trophy." I think that this is the first time that any­thing like this has ever been done in this town. Our only trouble is that there were co-champions this year and we are trying to figure out what to do. Looks like our safest bet will be to give it to each school for si:« months. 
President James Corrigan presented it to S t John's Cathedral Kgfa School at their Victory Banquet a few weeks ago. A short time after\vard it was presented to Mar­quette High School. We have received much favorable comment from everyone, and I am sure that it will result in more Milwaukee men enrolling at Notre Dame in the future. 
As Universal Notre Dame Night rolls around again, we are trying to figure out a program. Would like to have somebody come up from the campus, so keep us in mind when the time comes for making appointments.

As this is • written, it's all aboard ^ for the 

Notre Damc-Southem California game, leaving 
Butte on November 30. OfHcial representatives 
include Club President Babe O'Keefe, Judge 
T. E. Downey, Pat "Duck" O'DonneU, and Dr. R. C Monahan. There will be 65 more from Butte, and another hundred from the rest of the state. 
The Club offers its deepest sympathy to T. 

H. Oaas over the death of his mother last month. 
In addition to Individual donations, the club is making a drive to raise its share of the Rockne Memorial Fund. President O'Keefe expects to sell -the *'gold" bricks all the way from Butte to Southern California. Another star salesman is Jack Stansfield. who was a teammate of Rock. Jack is now living in Butte. 
The next meeting of the Treasure State alumni will be held late this winter with Elmer Layden as our guest of honor (we hope).

At a regular meeting, held November 7, at the Essex House in Newark at which a large number of members was present, matters of immediate interest were discussed at length and many constructive innovations undertaken. Final preparations for the exposition to be presented by the Rev. Doctor Wnensdiell to be held at the Academy of Medicine in Newark on Wednesday evening. November 30, were completed, and the following were appointed on the committees to handle the affair: Dan O'Neill. Sol Bontempo, Bill Comber, Tom Far­rell, Ray Geiger, Jack White. Jerry Froelich, Dan StiUivan, Harvey Rockwell and Jack Adams. Pete Qninn reported that the Navy game wiis a huge success. 
Pete Quinn and Han-'cy Rockwell were ap­pointed on c committee to receive advices con­cerning any ill members of the club so that the proper responses can be made for the club members to those who are ill. Anyone having knowledge of any sick member is requested to report to Pete or Harvey. 
A spirit of good cheer seemed to have arisen as a consequence of the result obtained in the seating arrangements at the Army game. as well as of the fine work of Mr. Cas«santa and bis band. Good wishes and appreciation were extended to all those who were respon­sible for making the Army game enjoyable in every way. 
Charles Loaghir. a new member of our club, in appearing for his concern was instru­mental in the birth of a bureau on employ­ment of which Harvey Rockwell was appointed chairman. All those members who are in need of employment, or those who feel that they would desire a change into some other field, are requested to contact Harvey Rock­well, who will forward them an application blank to be filled out so that their names can be placed on file. All those who in any way have positions to be filled and would like to have them filled with Notre Dame men ^ould also contact Harvey so that the most good for the most number of men can result. 
A report on the Hiord "nmes Dance, which was held a short time ago, was given and it proved to be. not only a financial, but a social success. 
Members of the New Year's Eve Ball com­

mittee are working hard to make this year's 
affair a complete success. The Ball will be 
formal and refreshments will be served during 
the course of the evening, and noise makers, 
souvenirs, streamers and other New year's Eve 
necessities will be provided for the entertain­
ment of all those present. Those serving on 
the various committees are Phil Heinle, chair­
man, Ray Gciger, and the two campus repre­
sentatives. Bob Tnson and Lany Doyle. This 
represents a joint venture of the Notre Dame 
alumni and campus clubs, and it is felt that, 
with the cooperation of every individual of the 
club, the New Year's Eve affair, the first an­
nual ball of its land, will be the successful 
forerunner of those to come in subsequent 
years.

NEW YORK CITY Daniel J. CNeiL '25, 101 Cooper St. Presi­dent; Robert A. Hamilton. *28, 63 Wall St.. Secretary. Bob Hamilton has given me the job of writing the New York Club column for the December issue of the Notre Dame ALUM­NUS. 
On October 25 a special meeting was held to award the prizes of our annual Scholarship Drive. T^vo hundred and twenty-five mem­bers attended and our recently married presi­dent, Dan 0*Neil, was present to conduct i t Before aw^arding the prizes Father Cosmos Shaughnessy, our Retreat Master, gave a beau­tiful presentation of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass. Besides ^ving both the historical and symbolical significance of the vestments. Fa* ther Cosmos made a running commentary on the movie presentation of the Mass. To see him investing himself in the robes, describing each article as he put it on, gave most of us an insight into parts of our religion we had never before understood. 
Following Father's talk. Jordan Hargrove told the members of the Club Directory which w^ill be distributed, free, with the December issue of the New York "Alumntis." Then came the awarding of the Army-Notre Dame tickets. As Don Sdil said "a bunch of lads named Butch from points such as Podnnk won most of them." It must have been legal though, because Jim Rizer did win two re-ser\'ed seats. 
October 23 probably was the biggest night ever in the club's history. Over 1,200 people attended the Reunion and Rally celebrating the silver anniversary of the Army-Notre Dame game at the Grand Ballroom of the Hotel Pennsylvania. Frank (Sat Eve. Post) Wallace was 3LC., and Jack Hoyt, his assist­ant. The program consisted of movies of this season's games, the Ohio State game and Rock, to whom the entire program was dedi­cated ; the Army-Notre Dame broadcast over the National Broadcasting Company's network; and many Efpeeches by prominent alumni and guests. Among the speakers were Father O'Hara. Elmer Layden, General Benedict and Coach Wood of the Army, Grantlond Rice. 
The Notre Dame Alumnus December. 1938 
Jim Farley, Ambrose O'Conncll, national alum­ni president, HUEH O'DonncU, our honorarj­president. Father Hneh O'Donncll, vice-presi­dent of Notre Dame, Angus McDonald, from Lcs Angeles. Gene Tunney, Pat O'Brien, Fa­ther Murdock, chaplain of West Point, Frank Walker, and Father MacXamara, all of whom gave short but very interesting talks. Other guests who were given a spotlight introduc­tion by Jack Hoyt were: Paul Castner, Mcrril­lat, Oliphant and Pritchard of the Army '13 team. Bed Salmon, first of N.D.'s famous plunging fullbacks, Kay K>ser, General Phe­lan. Dean McCarthy, John Kieran, John Law, Gene Buck, Arch Ward and many others. 
Several hundred dollars were collected from this meeting for the Rockne Memorial Fund and much of the credit for the success of it should go to the committeemen who worked so hard in preparing it. Dick Donoghue arid his Guest and Speakers Committee are especial­ly to be complimented for the great program they prepared. Among his assistants were: William Corr. William Cronin, L. J. CuIUney, Ed Fallon, Vic Fisher, Jcro' Gillespie, Dan Halpin, John Hinkel, John Hoyt, John La­velle, Frank McGec, Ray McGee, Ed Ncahcr. Dan O'Ncil, Colman O'Shaughncssj', Jim-Shcils, Drew Shicbler, George Vcrgara, Norb Gelson, Paul Maholjic and George Rohrs. Ed Beckman and his Arangement Committee also did fine work. His helpers were: Bill Cronin, Jack Hoyt, Vernon Rickard, who also did some fine singing at the Rally: John Moran, John Lavclle, Don Sehl, Tom Lantry and Tim Too­mey. Another committee which worked hard and obtained many favorable notices for the affair in the newspapers and over the radio, was the Publicity and Program Committee under Jordan Hargrove. His assistants were: Maurice Andrews, Don Bricc, Joe Crotty. Jack Farr, Irwin Goldman, Dan Hatpin, Charh'c Heckclmann, Willard Higgins, John Hinkel, Joe Schmidt, Bob Hamilton, Gerald Lyons and Jim Shea- Joe Friel and his Hnance Commit­tee, consisting of Bob Halpin, Joe Lenahan, Walter MdVTorrow, Herb Giorgio, Jim Rizcr, Jim Ward, Jim O'Connor and Tom Hughes, did a fine job. too. To Leo McLaughlin goes much credit for being the General Chairman of this great affair. 
The next afternoon, of course, everyone was either watching or listening to an account of that magnificent performance the Notre Dame players put on against Army. But that night more than 60 couples of Notre Dame folks joined with the Army in a gala ball at the Hotel Astor for the benefit of the Catholic chapel at W^est Point. According to those who attended everyone had a grand time, particu­larly when the Lambeth Walk number was introduced and carried through with profes­sional precision. This affair concluded the activities for the Army game week-end. 
On the following Saturday, however, some 213 members and friends of the club took advantage of the club's special train to Balti­more for the Na\T game. Although it was a wet day, according to Warren Fogcl who ran the trip, everyone enjoyed it immensely. 
Leo McLaughlin and his corps of assistants have their Rockne Memorial Fund Drive well under way at this time. With the fine start they received from the Rally it is to be hoped that they will be very successful. 
Our own scholarship drive, which annually sends a boy to Notre Dame, was very success­ful this year, making enough profit to cover a deficit incurred last year. John Balfc has been highly praised for the fine work which he and his committeemen performed this year.

Here are a few belated items of the Notre Dame Club of Peoria: Our annual picnic, held June 19 at Dr. Ward's farm, was featured by a ball Esme between the young blood of the organization and the veterans of many such a yearly battle. As usual, no one could keep track of the coroct score. Laurels for the day went to Leo Cavanaugh, chairman, and his as­sistants. Ernie Hcchinger, Ed Flanagan, and Al Gur>-. 
The warm days of July, and particularly the 21st, furnished an incentive for all members to accept the kind invitation of the Pabst Brewery to be their guests in the Casino room at the brewery. 
August IS marked the beginning of a con­crete and constructive effort on the part of the members to do something for worthy boys. At the meeting, books were distributed for the awarding of a bo.\ at the Illinois game, the proceeds from which were to assist in the sending of a worthy boy to Notre Dame. Father E. M. Farrell, director of Peoria Cath­olic Charities, who has done immeasurable good in his contacts with homeless boys, was the principal speaker, and pointed out the trying times every such child must face. At Spalding Institute on September 15, a smoker was held, principally to boost this actiWly. Refreshments were ser\"ed by the club. 
October 6 saw the conclusion of our efforts in this direction with a meeting at which the final drawing was made. The undertaking was a complete success, in a large measure due to the organization effort of our president. Bill Motsett, and in particular to his own enthusiastic effort. Bill alone disposed of over 500 chances. Frank Obcrkoctter was the chairman of the meeting, assisted by Henry Pratt and Ed Flanagan. Barney Matika, a native Czechoslovakian. whose brother is at present an officer in that country's army, gave a very timely talk on the situation in his na­tive counto'­
Plans were made for a Christmas dance to be held December 22. John Sloan was ap­pointed chairman. Bob Brovnie, Tom Mc-Sweenej-, and John Carmotiy comprise the rest of the committee. Plans were made for a din­ner meeting to be held November 12. Al • Welzenbach will be in charge of the arrange­ments. 
Peoria has become the residence of many men whose homes formerly were not here. Caterpillar employs the largest number of this group. There you will find Lfmis Crystal, Ed Flanaffan, John Simko. Steve Sdmidt, Tom FitzKcrald. Ed Snell, and Dick Delaney. Hiram Walker's has Bob McCormick, Jack Kinr and Leo Sdtrall in its organization. Ennio Arboit is coach of Spalding's undefeated football team, city champion. Datch Harting is with the Graybar Electric Dutch Johnson vaults his way through sales resistance for the Equitable Life of Iowa. Bob Lacey holds a position with the International Harvester. The co-operation and enthusiasm of these men has brought new life to our club.

Prexy Cliff Prodehl informs your wandering 

correspondent that the last meeting was pre­ceded by films of the Auburn-Villanova game wherein Clipper Smith's minions showed much of the old Rockne "class" to win handily from a good club. We might add, in passing, that our own Pat Conway stole the march on us in grabbing the N.D.-Army pictures for a showing to his West Catholic gridders. Fie I Fie! 
A program is under w*ay to launch a Father and Son Dinner for sometime during the Christmas holidays with Dutch Ridley in charge and Walt Phillip, Joe Mahoney and Adc Wackerman as his assistants. More of this anon. 
The suggestions for-promotion and publiciz­ing the Rockne Memorial were read and dis­cussed, and the drive is under way with Tom Carroll at the controls and Frank McManus and Jack Kenney throwing on the pepper. 
Chief Xeeson should receive a vote of thanks from the local nabobs as well as from our two friendly enemies. Army and Nnvy. for his able handling of the service game here. Can't you "engineer" the Irish here again. Chief? 
Harr>- Francis helped to put Dodge over at the Auto Show but cagily omitted intro­ducing the blonde lovelies (Ouch! Peg! I wuz only kiddin')

Several others dropped in after dinner to hear Father O'Donnell's speech con­cerning the Rockne Memorial Drive. Other speakers were Jim Armstrong, John Dorschcl, Bcrnic Henncssy and Judge Burke, who fav­ored us with another amusing story of life in old St, Joe Hall. The meeting ended with the showing of pictures of last year's Minne­sota game ivhJch were enjoyed by aU. 
Tlie Rochester Club was invited to partici­pate in the activities of the regional confer­ence of the Laymen's Retreat organization on November 12, Considering the football games that week-end we had a good representation. Several members attended the dinner in honor of Monsignor Fulton Sheen, who delivered a very fine address. 
Dick Tobin arranged an excursion to the Army game again this year, and he reports about 150 people made the trip. I saw Har­vey Rockwell at the rally Friday night at the Penn Hotel, and he informed me that he is still with the Weston Instrument Co. Business at Taylor Instrument must be fine, for Bill Belt has taken a vacation and gone to Cali­fornia for the U.S.C. game. Expect to get first hand report of the game when he re­turns. 
As this is written, plans are being made for our second annual Communion Breakfast on December 4. Last year we had a fine turn­out, and a much larger representation is ex­pected this year.

I deeply regret the fact that I have not sent in any account of the doings of the Notre Dame Club of Scranton for several months. However, we haven't had many activities, and I personalty have not had much interest in life In general. This has been due to the fact that on October 4 my oldest son, Edwin, age seven years, died of pneumococci meningitis, and I just have not been able to get my mind off the subject. The members of the Notre Dame Club of Scranton were very kind to Mrs. Leahy and myself during our period of greatest sorrow, and we will long remember their kind deeds and actions. 
Instead of devoting a lot of time to plan­ning unusual activities for special occasions, our club has recently decided to strive to main­tain interest by making each and every one of our monthly meetings as interesting as possible. As an initial step in this direction, at our last meeting it was voted unanimously that one member of the club be called on to address the club on the subject, "My Experi­ences in Life Since Leaving Notre Dame," at each of the monthly meetings until every mem­ber has taken his turn. Consequently, we are certain we are going to have some very in­teresting speeches. 
Bill Blcwitt, '27. has been selected to give the first of these addresses to our next meet­ing to be held Tuesday, December 13. Bill is one of Dr. Cooney's journalists. He is editor and publisher of "Coal Facts," a magazine devoted to the furtherance of safety measures in the anthracite coal mines. He is also en­gaged in the men's retail clothing business in Carbondale, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Scran­ton. 
And, by the way, our last mt^eting at which this new program was adopted was one of the best attcndetl meetings we have had since our club organized last Februarj-, Those present were Jack Boland, '31^ Jim Dcvcrs, '31-*33, Bob Golden, '32, Bill Greav>', '2-1, Bob Har­rington, '30-'32, Jim Jordan, '07, Joe Manning, '29, Vincent McCoola, '37, Tony O'Boyle, '37. Joe O'Hora. '31. Chick O'Malley, '31, Ed Phil-bin, '33, and the secretarj'. 
Needless to- say, a number of the boys at­tended the Notre Dame-Army game in New York on October 29, but I don't know Jxxst how many went. However, I do know that Bob Golden. Joe Manning and Bill Greavy were there and enjoyed it very much. There ivere seven special trains out of Scranton for New York that day, so you can see that there are a lot of Notre Dame rooters in Scranton and vicinity. 
Bill Grea%->'* Chick O'Mallty and I had a pleasant visit with Paul Castner. '23, Thanks­giving eve. Paul, as you know, is connected with the Standard Parking Meter Co., which manufactures those things now adomtng* the curbstones in many American cities, into which you have to drop a nickel to avoid getting a red ticket. He recently sold a lot of meters to the city of Scranton and came back to see how they were working. 
Our club recently made arrangements for a Mass to be said at S t Peter's Cathedral, which is centrally located, on March 31, 1939, for the repose of the soul of our beloved Coach Rockne. And, that is about all we have to re­port for the present.

The, Illinois and Kansas smokers, held at the Oliver Hotel, naturally drew smaller crowds. Both, however, were well aranged 
and had excellent programs. Jerry Claeys, George and Karl King were co-chairmen of the Illinois smoker, while Harry Richwine and John Gibbons managed the Kansas affair. 
More than 100 members of the club attended a smoker in the lay faculty room in the Notre Dame dining hall Friday evening. November 
25. The purpose of the meeting was to launch the Rockne Memorial Drive among St. Joseph Valley alumni. The duties of Valley alumni were clearly set forth in a splendid talk by Paul Bntler. Jim Armstrong, alumni secre­tarj-, explained the workings and details of the drive, and Frank Lloyd, University comp­troller, told of the success of Rockne Memor­ial drives in other cities. Moines of the Northwestern game were shown.

I have been more than negligent in taking^ care of my duties as secretary-treasurer of the Tri-Citj' Notre Dame Club since the election of officers last spring. However, as a matter of record, the following officers were elected: president, Hayes Murphy, '28, Rock Island Manufacturers Trust Building, Rock Island, Illinois; vice-president, George W. Vander Vennelt, '32, Union Bank BuildinE^. Davenport, Iowa; secretary-treasurer, Joseph E. Whaica, *29, Hotel Fort Armstrong, Rock Island, Illi-
There has been very little done in the line of dub activities during the last several months. The third Friday of each month is designated as the ofliciat club meeting day, and there is always an informal luncheon meeting^ at the Hotel Fort Armstrong on that date. A few days ago the officers voted to change the date from the third IViday to the third Wednesday of each month. The meet­ings will continue to be held at the hotel. 
"We have a very interesting personage here in the Tri-Cities in the person of Major Wil­liam T. Stevenson. The major is identified with the Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army, lo­cated in Rock Island. He was connected with the A.E.F- in Siberia during; the World War. He attended the University during the years 1899, 1900 and 2901.

LOCAL POLITICS 
The Notre Dame Club of the St. Joseph Valley stays religiously out of local politics, in one sense. But the November ballot took on some of the qualities of a club roster, in another. 
With M. Edward Doran, *20, Democratic chairman, and Edwin Hunter, '19, Republican chairman, the district personnel of both ma­jor parties was liberally dotted with N. D, men. 
The race for Congress was between the suc­cessful candidate, Robert Grant, '28, Republi­can, and George Beamcr, '29, Democratic nom­inee. The vote was close, and Grant won by virtue of a large vote from the district out­side St. Joseph county, where the Republicans held sway. Since the election, Beamer, who was prosecuting attorney, has been named city attorney for South Bend by the new mayor, Jesse Pavcy. 
Beamer is succeeded as prosecutor by Arth-. ur Schccr, '26, Democrat. 
Clifford Potts. '25, was defeated for judge of Superior Court No. 1, by the Democratic nominee and incumbent. 
Judge J. Elmer Peak, '12, led the Demo­cratic ticket in being returned as judge of Superior Court No. 2. 
Eugene J. Payton, '23, credit expert and professor in the College of Commerce, was successful Democratic nominee for the Indiana State Senate. 
Irving Garnitz, '35, was elected a state rep­resentative from St. Joe county on the Dem­ocratic ticket, and Gerard Hodscs, '32, was defeated for th^ same office on the Republican slate. 
Peter Bcczkicwicz, '15, incumbent county treasurer, was returned to that office on the Democratic ticket. 
Alexis Coquillard. '03, was defeated for county recorder on the Republican ticket. 
Thomas DuMont, '32-'34, was elected county sur\'cyor. Democrat. 
George Schock, 'IS, was elected city judge. Democrat. Charles Weiss, '32, was one of the few local Democrats defeated, losing to the veteran Republican incumbent, George Hull, of the famous HulUe and Mike tradition, in a city councilman race. 
Two N. D. justices of the peace w-on on the Democratic ticket, Joseph Nyikos, '23, and Francis X. Kopinski. '31, and in Mishawaka, Peter LaCava, '26, was elected to the same ofTice, also Democratic. 
ED SULLIVAN'S COMMENT 
(Under the title "Alma Mater," the follow­ing by Ed Sullivan, Hollywood reporter for the "Chicago Tribune" appeared in that paper on December 6, in the regular column called "Looking at Hollywood"—Eds.) 
HoIly\vood. Calif.. Dec. 5.—^For some time IVe been convinced that college football had reached such a stage of professional ballyhoo that it had outgrown its purpose. It seemed that the game had been taken from the kids to such an extent that sU that remained was a billion dollars worth of over-emphasis. At the Los Angeles Coliseum, as late as Saturday afternoon, the thought struck home again. . . Then on Saturday night we had dinner with five of the Notre Dame youngsters who had played In the game, and my conclusion is that if college football produces boys of the type of Copt. Jim McGoIdrick, Joe Thesing. Poul Kell, Tad Han'ey and John Kelly-it certainly is worth its salt. If this type of boy ts typical of college football, the national roots are an­chored deep and securely and the viewers-with­alarm can relax, because the country is in excellent hands. 
Dejected? Undoubtedly. McGoIdrick and 

' Kell had just played their lost game. But their dejection was not a personal thing. "At Kansas City we passed through at 1 o'clock in the morning," said McGoIdrick, "and five thousand people were at the station to cheer us. We \vould have liked to win for them and people like them who never went to our school and yet have adopted Notre Dame as an alma mater.".... They didn't dwell overlong on a reason that was closer to their hearts. They had wanted desperately to win for Elmer Layden, because this year's club was really Layden's own team. His last year's club had contained left overs from Hunk Anderson's regime, but this year's team w^as ell of Lay­den's kids, and they would have given every­thing they iwssessed to close out the season for him without a break in the victory parade. So they had reason for dejection, when they met us for dinner, but what amazed all of us is the manner in which they concealed it. 
We had gone to the Cocoanut Grove for dinner. Rudy Vallee directed attention to them with a very graceful reference, and immedi­ately hundreds of diners gravitated to the table. It was amazing to witness the audible affection of those who called to them, or slapped them on the back. "You can lose every 
game and you're still tops with tis." Alice Faye told them. .. . It was nice to see the manner 

> in which the kids handled themselves. They answered questions about the game quickly and clearly to Southern California rooters* offered no alibis, indulged in no post mortems. If they were asked about teammates' blunders they sidestepped the question. If they were asked aliout Trojan players, they praised them wholeheartedly. The questioning went on for hours, yet not once did these Irish players let any of their interrogators know that they were thinking of the Kansas City crowds that had cheered them at 1 a.m.. or that they were thinking of Layden. or that McGoIdrick and Kell were thinking that they had played their last game. That, I think, is the definition of a good loser, and these kids dramatized it as I've never seen it dramatized before. 
They got a great kick out of meeting Joe E. Brown, Alice Faye, Tony Martin, Wendy Bar­rie. Ben Oakland, and Rudy. Brown, who is going to South Bend for the N, D. rally, lis­tened to the football fans who were attempt­ing to console them by picturing future seas­ons and future games, "I know just how you guys feel." said Joe E. "There's nothing that anybody can tell you that will make yon for­get today's game." They looked at him and nodded. 
"Rosie" Rosenberg, an AU-American from Southern California, stopped at the table. "They were hot today, and you guys were just a bit past your peak." he said. They nodded: This Was a fellow talking their own language about the game. "Their second team gave them the edge," said "Rosie." 
We sat there for perhaps five hours, and not once daring that time did the Notre Dame kids let out a whimper or voice a might-have­been. So I say that if college football tnms out kids like this it is accomplishing a great thing in the pattern of American life, because in this life it is of importance to dish it out. but it is of greater importance to prove yon can take it.

our classmates in the avalanche of election returns, it should be recorded here that Dare Worth CU 4 of Pocatello. Idaho, was ^actori­ous in the election for the office of U.S. sen­ator for Idaho. The name of Senator Borah of Idaho has been most prominent in the press for many years.

" 'There is not a great deal of news avail­able at this time, John, other than that I am still connected with the Kokomo lithographic Company and happily married, with a fine little three-year old boy, prospective fullback at our house. I do occasionally have an oi;>­portunity to see a few of the Notre Dame fellows in and around this part of the coun­try. I did particularly enjoy a -visit a few daj-s ago from Joe Harmon, who is now^ coach­ing at the Cathedral High School in Indian­apolis. This is the first time I have seen Joe in probably 10 or 12 j-ears, and he seems to be about the same as ever/

Joe Boland came up with this just before he left for Los Angeles: 
"Now that the glaring absence of news -from the last ALUlVINTJS' class notes section, class of '27, has been duly noted, this observer takes a hint to gather together the scattered notes of a hectic football season and scriven a few scrivens on the doings of those '27 boys who have crossed the path.

The pride of the New Deal, your Professor Buckley, sends the following, together with the appended volume from Bob Hamilton, who is doinff a magnificent job as secretary of the super active New York club: 
"I have a bit of headline news this month concerning the '2S men. Alike Ricks is the father of twin boys, bom October 15 in La­fayette, Indian*!. He now has three boys to send to Notre Dame to take economics under the class secretary. Mike requested the ad­dresses of I^Iartin Callagy and Frank Hegarty. Mike is practicing law in Lafayette and has ser\'ed as a judge there. 
"The class of '28 will be represented in the next Congress. Bob Grant, running on the Republican ticket, defeated his old Notre Dame and high school boy friend. George Beamer, in a close race for Congress from the third district in Indiana. I believe Bob is the first '2Ser to be elected to Congress. Con­gratulations, Bob, and best wishes for a most successful political career. Bob will be a wel­come addition to the '28 gang now in Wash­ington. 
"I met Bob Graham of Grand Rapids the other day. Bob has been with the Securities and Exchange Commission here in Washington for the past three years. He is married and has one child. 
"I had a call the other day from John Fredrick, who was in Washington on business. John mentioned that Jerry Bigge recently be­came a father. 
"Many of you pnshahly saw the picture in the October 31 issue of 'Life* of August Grams and his four daughters: Mary, 7, EWcn, 5. Joan, 4, and Paddy, 2, all in N.D. mono-ram sweaters. We understand that Au^e gets the four daughters out for scrimmage every afternoon. How about challenging Jim Arm­strong and his four-son team to a game^ Augie? 
"Frank Ready writes from Monroe, Michi­gan, where he is prosecuting attorney that Jim Allen was in his office recently. Jim, according to Prank, is now the Detroit repre­sentative for the Lumberman's Mutual Insur­ance Company. 
"Thank you, 'March of Time* Wingcrter, for coming through with your 'famine of facts' last month. It was an excellent be^nninff for what I hope will be another successful series of columns by guest writers each month this year. I will be glad to have any of you offer suggestions as to whom you would like to select for the job in the coming issues. 
"I am turning the column over to Joe Mor­risscy for the next issue. Give him a big hand in the form of news flashes from every part of the country. His address is 317 Tuscalum, Cincinnati, Ohio. I know^ he will do as good a job writing the column as he is doing as president of the Cincinnati Club. Take it away, Joe, and remember the deadline for your copy is January 15.'* 
The Hamilton Center Echo: 
"Fortunately I read your column religiously — otherwise I'd never have known it was ray

LO.U., or A-W.O.L. The new Wages and Hours Bill complicates matters — it is necessary now to fill out two compliance forms — for 44 hours on my Wall Street job and also for this sec­retarial effort, whereas previously I worked a straight 88-hour week and no questions asked. Of course, until the recent election went the 'Right' way, 40 of the 44 hours were spent in defense of Capitalism against Communism. Now that things are getting back to normal perhaps we'll be able to put more time and effort into any and all endeuv* ors without recourse to official charts for guid­ance. It is now 4 A. M. {I'm writing the introduction after having finished the rest of this 'note') and well past the 88-hour limit. If an alphabetical snooper peeks in my win­dow, the responsibility is yours!II Note the Wall Street angle on the outlook — we're rugged individuals but hungry wolves! 
"Surprising as it may seem to you, there are only 12 graduates (including myself) of the class of 1928 who were bom and reared in the city of New York, Oddly enough there are 16 members of the class who have made this village their home town since graduation. Even more surprising is the irrefutable conclu­sion that the fellows who have adopted New York are much more active as members of the local alumni club than those who were born here. After you get through reading alxmt some of the boys you will note that most of our absentees seem to come from Brooklyn. I don't know the reason for this because our meetings are held at a very central point — the Centre Club — and it costs only a nickel to get there from each of the five boroughs — via IRT, BMT, 8th Avenue, bus, surface cars, et c We'd like to adopt more '28ers to help rejuvenate natives. I must say that the class of '28 could be a lot stronger as far as rep­resentation at the meetings is concerned. 
"We rarely, if ever, see Jim Conmcy, who is with Billings. OJcott & Co, Perhaps he is still submerged in the deep indigo which has per­vaded Wall Street for the past ten years and has not as yet emerged. 
"Bill Cronin, who is secretary to Frank Walker, has been very active of late and did some extremely good work for us, particularly in getting the Twentieth Century-Fox people to put together a worthwhile film about Rockne and the University, which was shovvn at the Army-Notre Dame Reunion and created much favorable comment. It may interest you to know that Bill seldom, if ever, played soli in his life, but he won the prize at the West­chester (^untry Club this summer for the longest drive in the golf tournament which we ran. You can reach Bill at 1600 Broadway.

"As you know Lou lliornton is no longer with us, but we would sure like to hear from him. He wrote some time ago telling us that he was doing some work on the campus, but since that date we have had no further details. 
"John Van Deventer Is another one of the 
boys who has left the metropolitan district and is now w^orking in Chicago as editor of a builders* supply magazine. You probably know -that he is John Law's brother-in-law.

The Notre Dame Alumnus 
land. His home is at West Hampton Beach and was right in the vortex of the storm. Some 30 people were killed or drowned within two miles of his home,—practically the entire township was wiped off the map. Notre Dame must have had Her eye on Charlie because no­body in his family suffered in the least, and the worst he got out of it was an argument with the landlord to replace his garage which had moved off its foundation. He couldn't make the Rally but did go to Baltimore on our special train. 
"Joe Kissling has moved to Flushing and is practicing law out there. He lives only a few blocks away from me, but the only time I see him is when we are at a meeting. He lives at 155-17 Sanford Avenue. 
"Tom Purcell also lives but a few blocks from me in Flushing—I met him in a res­tuarant one night recently. That is about the only time I have seen him in six years. He's married and lives on Kissena Boulevard — I believe that he is a practicing attorney. 
"Larry CuIIiney is doing good work for us on the staff of the New York 'Alumnus.' You will remember that he was head man on the 'Juggler' back at school. To help us along' he has volunteered his services to make sketches, etc. He is being kept very busy and on the jump with FDIC. He lives where -we meet — the Centre Club —120 Central Park South. 
"Vic Fisher has attended our meetings re­ligiously. He has proven to be an invaluable member. He, Bill Cronin and I were the only three of the class ot '28 to attend the Retreat at the Bishop Malloy House. Vic works for the West Shore out of Weehawken and lives at 340 Moshohe Parkway, Bronx. 
"John Antus (21 Fifth Ave.) has been com­ing around quite frequentb* to our affairs. He practices law in this city—and he's still the same smiling John. 
"Dr. Dan Bradley now lives at 123 Bay> view Avenue, Amity^'ille, L.T., where he is held in high regard as an MJ). He induced a couple of local boys to sign up at N.D. this year and had them in tow at our Freshman Sendoff, He was all over the Penn the night of our Rally. 
"I haven't seen George Byrne of 130 Park Place, Brooklyn, more than once in five years. He evidently gets his mail okay, but doesn't show up. 
"Bad Callagy has left N.Y.C. and is now living a few doors from my old residence of ten years ago — on Allen Street in Albany, He's protecting the peoples 'rates* in his ca­pacity as Iaw>-er for the State Public Service Commission. 
"Vince Carey hasn't been seen in years. He was last reported living in the wilds of Brooklyn and working for the Bankers Trust. We'd like to know if he's still in these en­virons. 
"George Coury dropped into my office a few months ago, looking as fit and prosperous as e\*er and, according to my latest informant, he is still with Shields & Co., of Chicago. 
"George Crongeycr was instructor of insur­ance salesmen for the Home Life outfit just up 'William Street until about a year ago. He was then transferred to the IKmea Square of­fice in White Plains, but recently his mail has been returned marked 'no forwarding address.* , . . Nor are his former employers much help 
in trying to locate him. 
"Met Manry Conley at the Army game, 
.munching a hot dog. He looks like a cross between a corporation lawyer and a local po­litical bigvng. Stilt living in F\iIton, New York.

"BiU DnSy, my senior roommate, up and got married a few months back. I see him occasionally in the registration di\iuon of the 
S.E.C. when I trip to D.C. 
"Frank Daqactte is living at 30 Maple Ave­nue, Tuckahoe, and since summer, has reli­giously attended all of our functions, ^' s the same old quiet, unggtminmg and hard working guy .. . as evidenced by his selling five times his quota of Scholarship chances. 
"Bcmie Garter is rumored as living at the (Centre Club where we hold our monthly meet­ings. I see him occasionally bat when I go to his room to try to get him to take a more active interest I never can find him in . . . and, when I went to check his address, 1*11 be darned if it was listed at all. 
"Gene Farcll hasn*t been seen in a blue moon. According to my records he lives at 75 McDonough Street, Brooklyn, but it might as well be China. 
"Frank Galardy (Gagliardi to old timers) has been very much present of late and has supported our activities 100 percent. It's a pleasure to have him with us. He's living in Brooklyn at 1306 Troy Avenue. 
"You probably saw a picture of Angie Grams and his four Notre Damettes in a re­cent issue of *Iafe* magazine. Whoever sent the picture evidently lived in Brooklyn, but if Augie lives there, he hasn't let us in on the secret. 
"Dick Greene was last heard of in Rochester and. of all people to make the contact, it was my father-in-law. Obviously, they met while bending elbows in a local stube, and, when they discovered that they had something in common, they became practically inseparable for the rest of the evening. Things must have gone along very nicely but when Dick invited my padre by marriage to come along with him and meet his ^vife at 2. A. M. my in-law thought it was time to say *Bon Soir.* 
"Bob Grant holds a responsible position in Washington, D.C. with the SEC as an expert accountant. If Duffy & Grant get together very often, I can see the financial giants of the country trembling! Yeah!! 
"Jim Hartley* my old side kick in classes, is seen about these parts occasionally but darned if I know what he's doing for a living — or who he's doing. BIy other side kick was Glenn Hatdi, whom I haven't seen in years. T^e three of us graduated with about the same scholastic average. 
"I had a letter recently from Dr. Joe Kane. He's back in Binghamton now and stepping right into his great dad's shoes. About the only time I see Frank Kelly is at the Army game. I may be wrong but somewhere I got the dope that he is now in Bob Kirby's line. 
"Turk KeUy is doing right well by himself coaching basketball at De LaSalle Academy. He also teaches in one of oar local schools and does officiating between times. Jack Lat­velle is coaching at All Hallows school in the Bronx and is a big-time football and basket­ball referee in the Eastern AX. Despite his aldermanic bulk he can still move fast. 
"Search me as to Walt Layne's whereabouts 
— and you won't find anything. He was quite active hereabouts a few years ago. but he's gone with the wind. The night of -the Re­tmion and Rally I was so dam busy I didn't get a chance to stalk a big^ guy who looked like Frank McCartiby from Indianapolis. Fd almost be certain it -was him — *waz yon there. Mac?* Fd like to hear from Tom Makon, He was here a year ago and said he was being transferred to the Minneapolis office of He-Kinnon & Thompson, a stock exchange house. 
"Although we see Hike Biihko occadonally since he moved from Tuxedo Park to Clifton, New Jersey, we never see Dick Novak of the same town. Lt, Tom Noon came to our last meeting after rushins through his duties at Flco'd Bennett Held and he didn't have a chance to change from his nifty looking Ma­rine uniform. He looks great. He also took in the Army-Notre Dame Military Ball. Cbmm. Joe Byrne called me a couple of weeks ago and said an unshorn, uncouth individual, rep­resenting himself to be Connie Ochoa of Mex­ico was in his office looking for a hand-out, I told him that Connie had only recently re­turned to that little Mexican village which is named after a cute variety of dogs, so I said, 
•hold him, 1*11 be over to look and give the double O-' Dumed if it wasn't Connie, look­ing fit as a fiddle and like a million dollars 
— he came all the way back to see the Army game, plus Minnesota and Northwestern. 
"Joe Bepctti is on our mailing list at 40 VowDins Street, New York City — and bis mail has never been returned, so I guess he's still around, but you couldn't prove it by his attendance at our functions. Several years ago Georpe Sargus was in New York working for Macy & Co.. but we haven't seen him for a long time. I heard that he returned to his native Bellairc and opened a very successful department store. I sincerely hope it's true. 
"Al Taylor is still around Brooklyn but he keeps in the background- Lives at 12S2 Union Street, Saw Dr. John Viktoryn a couple of years ago in Cleveland. We didn't get a chance to do any night clubbing but we sure did plenty of bull throwing for a couple of hours. Like most modest hard-working professional men, John was even then building up an en­viable reputation. I hope he has continued to progress and prosper. 
"Vic Zimmerman never shows up at a meeting. Five or six years ago I used to meet him occasionally in Wall Street and two or three jears ago I used to see him in church upstate, near Kinderhook Lake where his mother has a. beautiful estate and not many miles from where my i)eopIe live. He's still on the mailing list but we never see him. His address is 839 Caroll Street, Brooklyn. Jim Hurlburt lives at 135-33 226th Street, Spring­field Gardens, L.L. but when, as and if be engages in club activities, he must do it on the Q.T. 
"Bcmie Stcttler dropped in a few months back after an air jaunt from California. He's doing all right by his employers, an account­ing outfit with headquarters in Pittsburgh. He travels a lot and on his recent junket just had time to see his wife between plane trips. Ed Cunningham's father was in an automo­bile accident recently and injured his hip. Ed lived out on 'Longuyland' for a while, but re­cently caroe back to our znJdst and now vre see him quite often. He looks fine. Lives at 535 East SSth Street, New York City. John Paul Courts graduated with high honors from Fordham Law a long time back. We met him once or twice since and understand that he's on his own, but he never comes to see us and we don't know where he's located. 
"Fellows I'd like to hear from and all about what they're doing: John and Pete Bctmc, Frank Donovan, Bob Evans, Pete Gallagher, Joe Geraght}-, Hud Jeffreys, Gus Jenkins. Gerald Ludwig, and Lawrence Stadlcr< 
"I see George Conner at McGraw Hill's 42nd Street plant occasionally, but never at a meet­ing. He's in their advertising department. Bud Farley, another old roommate of mine, is doing better than all right in Albany. He runs Farley's Tavern on South Pearl Street like an old hand and has the welcome mat out for all Notre Damers all the time. His wife and three beautiful youngsters are somethin' to look at! 
"Saw Pat Canny at the Reunion and Rally. He reminds me of Buddha — he doesn't change or age with the years. Still the same hearty, hail-fellow-well-met. He's a lawyer for the Erie Railroad and I believe works out of his our town — Corning, aiaj-be it's Cleveland. 
"I received this letter just as I was about to mail copj* to you and I see no reason for deleting any part of it. Glenn Haldi was thinking along the same lines I was when writing about the three *H's.' I'd sure like to see him some day. He's a little ahead of me in one respect. I've got one daughter so far. I live only a few blocks from the Fair so I'll be looking forward to seeing him. 
" 'This morning I received my copy of the ALUMNUS and was mighty glad to note that you are going to substitute for Backley and loop a few long ones through the basket for the next issue of the ALUMNUS.' 
" 'This announcement brought to my mind the good old combination of Hamilton, Hatch. Hartley who so successfully baffled the hard­working professors in 1923 by giving them some type of answer (right or \vrong) to every question asked, so what would be more fitting than for Jim and I to give you a bit of news to help you out with your editorial problem.' 
" *I have not seen Jim for almost three years and our last meeting was quite a sur­prise for I came home from work late one eve­ning to find Jim and his wife parked in my front room and as you can well imagine we had a grand reunion.' 
" T had hoped to get down to New York for the Army game this year and look up bctii you and Jim, but my plans went astray and I am now looking forward to see the World's Fair and renew some of my acquaintances.* 
" 'Can't give you very much news of the '28 gang here in Rochester, although I do see Jim Gcraghty at club meetings now and then.' 
'* 'I might tell you. Bob. that we have had an addition to the family since leaving New York and that makes the family score tied with one boy and one girl.* 
" 'Please give ray regards to any of the New York gang who may remember me and don't let the Buckley assignment get you down.* 
•'Glenn's address is Pennsylvania-Dixie Ce­ment Corporation, Rej-nolds Arcade Building. Rochester, New York, 
"Yours truly continues in business at the same old stand — ten years now. If any of the boys are considering financial reorganiza­tions, want underwritings successfully con­cluded, are recapitalizing or wish to dispose of large blocks of stocks without disturbing the general market in same, or perhaps do a little trading. I'd like to get a crack at *em. Despite Martin Acts and SEC regulations, we've managed to keep out of jail and pay our employees in ca^h—no moan feat these days and practically a success in this business. Nor would my wife and baby care to see me vnc&­tioning in Atlanta either — or would they ? As for athletics, I'm still like an old fire horse — and about as fast as a 20-year plug. ­The New York A.C. basketball committee will be pensioning me off so that they can got a captain who'll be on his feet more often than otherwise — and these new rules are no help to an old guy!!!" 
1929 Secretary: Joseph P . HeNminara, At­torney Gen. Office, Indianapolis, Ind. Joe McNamara is preparing the way for the 10-year reunion with the following swell con­tribution : 
"Now that the telegraph companies are prov­ing the fallacy of the adage 'a corporation has no soul' by sentimentally providing us with form expressions of Christmas Cheer. 
the newspapers can be expected to break forth with the annual reprint of Virginia O'Halla­han's letter about Santa Claus and what the kindly editor of 'The New York Sun* said in reply. All of which is by way of setting the stage for the class £ecretar>' to wish each and every T\venty-Niner the happiness he so richly clesen*es and the spiritual blessings which are the heritage of a son of Notre Dame .. . and let us hope that the new year will bring the satisfying peace of the Uttle-town-of-Bethle­hem to a nation that's pinned too much faith in Bethlehem. Pal 
"Now that red haired autumn is fading fast into the season in which the lights form their haphazard constellations in the tall buildings before closing time. New Haven, Connecticut, and Cy Costello seemed a good starting point for another edition of class notes about class notables: Cy was able to give us some of the dope on Boy Guidance men. about whom many of you have been asking — Steve Murray* is an assistant in the Supreme Headquarters Knights of Columbus Ser\'ice Department and is still a truly great performer . . . T. Russell Mc­Grath is teaching school at Providence and successfully continuing his father's insurance business . . . Francis Cnlhanc is teaching and coaching at Ringe Tech in prim and proper Boston . . . John Rcilly is functioning perfect­ly in the recreation department at Houston. Texas . . . We were sorry to hear of the death of Martin J. O'Phclan of Minneapolis. 
"Around the Supreme Council Headquarters of-the Knights of Columbus at New Haven we picked up some information regarding Cy CDstcllo's own activities: After graduation in 
•29 the Boy Life Bureau of the Knights of Columbus acquired Cy's ser\'ices as a field sec­retary and permitted him to see America first, lecturing and organizing boys' groups from coast to coast and up in Canada. In 1031, to continue his study of 'boys' Cy taught high school subjects at the Christian Brothers' con­ducted Saint Raphael's Academy in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, and this was followed by prac­tical studies in delinquency, conducted at the Connecticut Reform School. Along about this time President Roosevelt desired a comprehen­sive report on the problems of newspaper boys and girls and Cy was selected to work on this great special report. Government service claimed two years of Cy's time until, in 1936, he returned to the Knights of Columbus Boy Life Bureau as the associate director where he is doing remarkable work as this harried scribe attempts to beat another deadline. 
"Cy said that he had met today's Richard Harding Davis, newsleuth John V. Hinkd of 'Scholastic' fame, in New York just after Hinkel had returned from Spain, about which John had written an outstanding series of ar­ticles, in collaboration with Rev. Dr. Thorn­ing. Cy also spoke of his work with Charley Grimes back in '33 when they labored together to promote the Notre Dame Club of Rhode Island, which is presently quite active. 
"Several follows have been asking to hear about Bob Dick, so in response to a bit of prompting Bob has been good enough to send in the following letter: 
" 'Following my admission to the Bar in 1931, I became associated with the law firm of Smith, Brock. Akolt and Campbell and ever since I have been following the troubled life of a lawyer. In 1929 I married and in 1933 we were blessed with the arrival of a beautiful little girl, Mary Sue.* 
" 'The Denver Notre Dame Club has been exceedingly active. In 193S we organized a football train for the Ohio game and in 1937 we attended the Minnesota and Pittsburgh games. This year about 200 Denverites will be present at the Minnesota game and right now I am planning on being in the stadium for the kickoff. Last week in October we lis­tened in on the Army game. We had several Army officers at a luncheon as our guests among whom was the football representative of "West Point in 1913. We enjoyed his stor­ies very much and particularly the storj" of how Notre Dame went to West Point with a guarantee of only SHOO/ 
*' *Harry Lawrence, *29, is secretary of the club and when not promoting some club func­tion is working hard pulling in the sheckels for New England Electric Company. Harry married a verj- lovely Birl in 1036.' 
" 'My brother Bill is married and working hard with American Steel and Wire — when not out hunting or fishing, which, by the way, is very good in this particular region.' 
** 'John Moran, '25, formerly of Denver and Continental Oil Company, has transferred his activities to Houston, Texas.' 
" 'Charles Haskell and Al Prantz, '29. are both competitors of mine in the legal profes­sion. Both are married and hnve very lovely families.' 
••Ray Brady. '25, of Salt Lake City, Utah, was in the office recently. He plans to attend the Minnesota game.' 
" *We do not have many visitors and I can't understand why — because Denver is one of the finest cities and Colorado a wonderful state. A million tourists in Colorado a year and ril bet that, in a good many years, not a Notre Dame man among them all.' 
*' 'Well. Joe, this isn't what I would call a successful letter, but it is my initial tr>' and hereafter I will try and report a Uttle more faithfully to the class secretarj':' 
"Thanks a lot. Bob! Yfur courtesy in re­sponding is genuinely appreciated. 
"Those who go looking for Fred X. Baer should know that he has moved to 132 Seventh Avenue. LaGrange, Illinois. Incidentally, you lads who remember when Fred and Jane Wilders (St. Mary's '2S or '29) eyes engaged in exchanging those promissory notes for the future will be interested to learn that they married back in 1931 or thereabouts and that the Baer household is brightened by Fred Jr. (age 6) and Mary Jane (age 4). Fred is the division sales managerfor Automatic Electric Company of Chicago and reports that chronic suburbanitis keeps him from seeing the many Notre Dame men in Chicapo whom he would like to contact. However. Fred did report that Freddie Haw is still on the inside at the Continental Bank and maintains his residence at 1450 Garfield Boulevard. Chicago . . , that John BuI5n is teaching school but further de­tails are unknown . . . and that Ray Ang­stein is 'in insurance.' 
"Confession: "WTiile we were climbing the tree of knowledge, your scribe regarded the class notes as a queer manifestation, — a kind of exuberant capering around a discovered truth. — which was hard to explain. But since experience reveals that the ratio of queries to responses can be 46 to 2 (no political reference intended) a full bodied letter such as this one from John P. Berchcid, written from 4823 Parkway. Fairfield, Alabama, is a real joy. 
" 'You are a most convincing letter writer, and I hope quite as successful when you appear before a jury in oral argument. Wish I could believe that old Cameo Kirby and some of the other fellows still remember me after all these years. — and remember you asked for this:' 
" 'I left my native state in June, 1931, to take up residence in Alabama. I had no ties in the North and, since my father was trans­ferred here to take charge of one of the U.S. Steel Corporation subsidiaries, I followed him.' 
" 'Several conditions made the pursuit of a legal career seem impractical, so that course has been abandoned, at least for some time to come.' 
" 'Soon after my arrival in Birmingham, a job opened for me in the sales department of the American Steel and Wire Company, that company being a U. S. Steel subsidiary. Later on the Tennessee Coal Iron and Railroad Com­pany, another subsidiary, took over all the Wire company's propertj* here in this dis­trict, and consequently I am now employed by that outfit. The T. C. I., as it is known hereabouts, sent me to Savannah. Georgia, where I stayed for a year and a half. Was connected with the warehousing end of our business and gathered some experience in that line. Returned to Birmingham and went into the invoicing end of the steel business and, after about a year and a half. I was trans­ferred to our new thirty-five million dollar tin plate mill. Am now in the cost and distribu­tion department of the auditing bureau. Not yet a vice-president, but managing to keep the wolf from the door.* 
" 'Was married a year ago last September to a girl from Tennessee and can find no reason to wish I had done otherwise. Can re­port no future candidates for Notre Dame or St. Mary's as yet.' 
" 'While in Savannah. I saw Charlie Powers and another Notre Dame man, Frank Emmcr­ick, frequently* Also ran into Howie Phalin one evening at my hotel, and had quite a visit with him.' 
" 'Several years ago Elmer Layden was in town with one of his former football teams and we had a nice chat. There are few Notre Dame men in this state and, of course, any contact with anyone is enjoyable. I extend a welcome to any student present or past who happens to be in this vicinity to taste cur southern hospitality.* 
" 'Joe. see if you can get James T. L. Mor­rissey of Walsh Hall fame to give us a few words concerning himself. Last report I had he was in Shelton. Washington. Also my old friend George Le Grand Housley, whom I know is married and I believe in Washington, D.C.* 
" 'I hear from D. M. Donahue about once a month and he has established himself in the practice of law in Batavia, New York. The only dark note in all my last few years has been the death of my mother in August, which was a sad blow to our family. Notre Dame lost one of her staunchest supporters with her passing.* 
" 'Please convey my regards to Father O'Hara and Dean Konop, the next time you see them. Also to others who may be inter­ested.* 
"You may be certain that you have our grateful appreciation for that fine letter, John. Do it again sometime! 
"Back in the days when 7^-ndal. South Da­kota, was represented on the campus by Jim Krall (James E. to the Bostonians) he gave every indication of being a benefactor to the human race and he is: for Jim is providing the territory surrounding Iowa with Burroughs Adding Machines — and. to one who has la­bored hard trjung to fill out tax returns, an adding machine can be such a comfort! Jim attended the Minnesota-Notre Dame game and announced confidentially that he believed the team w*ouId go through the season without a defeat. Prior to going with Burroughs, Jim was managing director of the South Dakota Sales and Net Income Tax Department and an examiner in the Division of Audits and Ac­count*;. Jim reports that the Notre Dame men around Sioux City are very scattered, but that he occasionally sees Cy Kasper. who is the 
Collector of Internal Revenue at Aberdeen. South Dakota, and also Lon and Vircil Nmvin. of Mitchell. South Dakota^ We are happy to hear that Vince Harrincton was re-elected to Congress from the district of Iowa which embraces Sioux City. This was an exceptional achievement since the trend in voting was all the other way. . . . Best of all we liked Jim Krall's statement that 'business is good.' Those what want to drop Jim a line can reach him at the Burroughs Adding Machine Com­pany, 707 Douglas Street, Stoux City, Iowa. 
"There is at least one member of the Qass of '29 who is happy that public opinion runs like a shower — there is no medium between hot and cold. After six years or so of count­ing New Deal measures jumping over the Con­stitution and trying to convince the populace that the very milk w-agons on Pennsylvania Avenue were tumbrills Philip C. Landsman is wearing one of those coast to coast smiles these days. And he deserves to! Phil has been the Republican chairman up in Buchan­an, Michigan, almost continuously since 1520. He has also been quite successful in practic­ing law in Buchanan and has been acting as city attorney (as an indication of his diplo­macy it is worth while to note that Buchanan benefited from a number of worth while PWA allotments). Phil has been married since 1934 and seems to be the same energetic and enthu­siastic lad that we all liked so well. He hasn't changed much. 
"Another city attorney from the '29 ranks is Casper R, (Gappy) Grathwohl over at Niles, Michigan. Casper is married and has three wonderful children. Your scribe found that he is very well-liked and respected by his fellow townsmen and still plays well at every­thing— especially golf. Good old Tom Farrell is also practicing law at Niles and in addi­tion presides as justice of the peace. Tom is married, without issue, a perfect gentleman and a good law>'er. 
"Harold Reynolds, Pat Manion's forme r right hand man, visits Landsman very often. Harold has a splendid law practice in Chica­go and his work takes him to all parts of the country. Your secretary is wig-wagging Rey­nolds to forward some of the information that he has collected on the '29ers on these travels. 
"The inimitable Mr. Dooley [the other one— Ed.] said that the 'Supreme Court follows the election returns.' That being the case your class secretary believes that he has sufficient precedent for presenting a few remarks by another Republican Revere, who writes'the following at the express request of your re­porter. We refer to Larjy Carton who has made quite a name for himself in the practice of law around Red Bank, New Jersey, as the senior partner of Carton and Abramoff (54 Broad Street, Red Bank, New Jersey). Here's Larry's letter: 
" 'I received your letter the day before elec­tion, and activities along political lines have prevented me from ansirering it until today. I was very glad to hear from you, however, and wish to apologize for not having kept you better informed of what I have been doing for the last few years.' 
" 'Briefly, the story is this: After leaving Notre Dame, I went with Bill Kricg and Bart McHngfa up to Cambridge, at the Harvard Law School. Bill, no doubt, has told you of our three years* association as roommates and our ultimate graduation in 1932. In 1932 I be­came associated with Arthur T. Vanderbilt, president of the American Bar Association. and remained with him until 1936. About that time X decided that it was best to get out and try to make my own living rather than live on somebody else's prestige, and entered into a partnership with a classmate of mine 
98 The Notre Dame Alumnus December, 1938 
at Har\-ard, under the firm name of Carton and AbramofE. We are practicing in my home town of Red Bank, New Jersey, and, I am pleased to report, doing quite well. During part of the time I served as deputy counsel to ihe Kew Jersey Commissioner of Alcoholic Beverages, but found that I did not particu­larly like to work for the State, and I resigned from it. I was recently elected a member of the Republican County Executive - Committee, which is a minor political office, and have been taking some part in political campaigns.' 
" 'You will be surprised, I think, to know that I married Katherine Fettit, a student at State Teacher's College, two years ago. We live in Chapel Hill, a little village outside of Red Bank. There is also a new occupant in our household named Lawrence A. Carton, 3rd. who will undoubtedly find that the '3rd* added to his name will not only cause him to be regarded as a snob, but also increase his cost of living. Tell Bill Kricg that this kid of ours is probably the nicest one he has ever seen, and I will tell him more about it when I see him at the reunion at Notre Dame next spring." 
'* "ThoTc are a number of Notre Dame boys in this vicinity, notable among whom arc Dr. George 3IcI7onncll, who also graduated in 1929. and who has established a very successful practice of medicine at Freehold. New Jersey. We had our annual outing at the Army-Notre Dame game in New York together. George is so far unmarried, but seems likely to change his status at any time.' 
" 'Vincent McCue, another one of our old Badin Hallites, lives in this vicinitj-. He is also a lawyer practicing here in Red Bank, and furnishes competition to your truly. David Diamond, who graduated. I think, in our class, is practicing medicine at Oceanport, New Jersey, w^hich is quite near Red Bank. I am glad to report that he is also quite sue-. cessful in his chosen profession.' 
" 'Before closing, I want to compliment you on the fine work you are doing in taking the trouble to collect information from such un­worthles as myself.' 
•'The man who could make a piano sound like a symphony: — intelliegnt. keen-witted and nimble-fingered Irv Corcoran, recently passed through Indianapolis on his honey­moon trip. Irv was married in Chicago to a girl who can best be described by saying 'when you look into her eyes it is like enter­ing a church.' Ir\*. will be remembered as the inan who wrote the ofilcial song for the Class Prom. . . . He probably wants to bo forgotten as the man who collaborated with your secretary in producing the musical com­edy 'The Kickoff* of the vintage of 1929-1930. 
"The class secretarj- fell into a bit of luck on the day before the dead-line for this issue when he met Bob Knox who had just been married to Louise Steele at Springfield, Illi­nois, and who stopped off in Indianapolis on a trip to Washington, D.C. A number of Notre Dame men attended his wedding in Springfield, but there were only two '29ers in the crowd, viz; John Igoc, who is with the National Tube Company in St. Louis, and good old Howie Phalin, who is still making America book-conscious. 
"At most all the football games this year some one has been asking for information about Frank J. Bcltin. Investigation proved that Frank is in industrial engineering with the American Steel and Wire Company, a sub­sidiary of the United States Steel Corporation in Cleveland. Ohio. Frank is one of the brave lads who married in the fall of *29. At that time he was selling for Swift and Company out of Toledo, Ohio. At the hei^t of the depression he moved back to Cleveland and started in industrial engineering with Swift and Company, following which he did ad­vance study with A. V. Segur Company of Chicago, and after 18 months took his present position. Frank reported on the other mem­bers of the class whom he had seen recently in about the following manner: 
" *I occasionally see Tom Kiener, who Is in the coal business at Cleveland. Karl Mmrter­stcck and I have lunch frequently; Karl be­ing connected with the Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Company. Speaking of the Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Company, I enjoyed seeing Bob Trotter, who is -with that concern, at a Notre Dame summer dance. Bob is lo­cated in Sandusky. Ohio. When I last saw C]cte Schneider he was telling me all of the advantages and disadvantages of being a "gen­tleman farmer." Clete is working in Cleveland and living on a farm about 20 miles west of the city. Don Ht^an spent a week-end with us last month. He is now living in Detroit. I enjoyed spending a Saturday evening with Norm Hartzcr. who was in Cleveland for the American Bar Association Convention this summer. Bill Boles was also a convention vis* itor in Cleveland, and I had lunch and a good talk with him.' 
"There used to be a melodrama — and there always vnM be one — in which the golden haired heroine says 'I was never more serious in my life!* That furnishes the theme for the statements which I am in a position to make about Clarence (Oonie) Donovan. Just before the Northwestern game X had the good fortune to see Oonie at Evanston and can report authentically that he is just as hand­some and just as much of an 'All-American* man as he was back in the days when we were misstas morning prayer. Donovan has just completed a very successful term as pres­ident of the Bedford Chamber of Commerce and has done a great deal for his community. He is presently the national committeeman of the Young Democrats of Indiana and was fea­tured by the State Democratic Committee dur­ing the campaign that has just closed, as one of its headline speakers. Donovan is practic­ing law in Bedford and is easily the outstand­ing young lawyer of his territory. 
"After the Notre Dame-Northwestern epic of '3S we met Bill OXonnor and his wife (formerly Louise Dumas of Fowler, who dressed beautifully in dark colors—but they looked gay on her). Bill is a real power in the Indianapolis Board of Trade and a shrewd­ly energetic, success-story of his own in the wholesale grocery business. 
"Chicago's 'Old Heidelberg' is just that because of the expert ministration of rotund, smiling Don Willdns oC 'Juggler* business staff renown. Don is an advertising specialist and handles several other important accounts be­side the Old Heidelberg, •— but that's the most pleasant place to meet up with him. Drop around to chat with Don when you hit Chi. 
"Reliable Matt Cnllen has moved his firm ^f Gilmor^ Hendricks .and Cullen over to suite 1225 at 160 North LaSalle Street, Chi­cago. You can telephone Matt at Central 3894 if ynu need legal advice in Chicago. . . .** 
VL C Kirchner was one of those Arkansas travelers whose trek from Pine Bluff, for the l^Iinnesota trame, was amply rewarded by the game itself. 
1930 Secretary: Robert Hellnmff, Hnm* ^^ boldt BIdg., St. Louis, Missonri. Warren Fogcl produces beautifully as fol­lows: 
"Bob HcUmng has designated me as secre­tary for the coming issue of the ALUMNUS with particular reference to the news of the 1930 reunion at the New York Ctty'a Reunion and Rally commemorating the 25th anniver­sary of the Notre Dame-Army game. As you know, the party was held at the Hotel Penn­sylvania on Friday, October 28, and was one of the most successful occasions ever witnessed by yonr correspondent and ever held by the club here in New York. 
"The writer had as his guests for the week­end J<^n Slotz, the Kitchener, Ontario, news tycoon, and his wife. We arrived at the Penn about S:30 and attempted to set up headquar­ters in one of the boxes where the men of *30 might gather. I don't know how success­ful we were, but we corralled about 25 of the boys for handshakes and beer. 
"Credits for the success of ihe party are first in order and, accordingly, Dick Dono­cfane leads the way as chairman of the Enter­tainment Committee of the Rockne Memorial Fund and resiionsible for the list of celebrities in attendance. Jim Rizcr was also of the committee, as was Tim Toomcy, who presided over the beer bar. The affair was also aided by Frank Dunn, who maintained the club headquarters for the week preceding the game and also during the week preceding the Na\-y game at Baltimore to which the club ran a special train. 
"A varied group of '30 men all appeared, among them two newly-weds, Bcmie Conroy and Don Laurie. Judge Con Carey came down from the North Country and although not a newly-wed. he admitted that he was ripe for the picking. Tom Cumngham ushered Con and Bernie around and looked to be en­joying the job immensely. I forgot to men­tion that Tom Lantr>' was also one of those responsible for the success of the party, being on the Finance Committee. Incidentally, I understand the party was very successful fi­nancially and will turn over a substantial sum to the Rockne Memorial Fund. 
"Charlie Sullivan, Art Dennchy, Henry Frcy and Ban Brocckcr, the latter a pillar of one of the leading law firros in the city, used their lips for i^freshments and conversation, the conversation being of greater extent. Jack Flanairan, who practices law at Newburgh. came down with Federal Judge Conger of the Southern District of New York, and started to tell the judge about the goodness of the Notre Dame Law School, particularly at the time when he graduated in 1930. Johnny Prcece, now a surgeon in Brooklyn, £d Ells­worth, Jerry Parker, the efHcient major-domo of the Centre Club, all added authority to the occasion. 
"I saw Gus Bondi and Bill Walsh at the game the following day but could not catch their eyes. They probably were at the Re­union but in the crowd cf 1,500 people, it was not unusual to miss some of our class. George Winkler, the proud father of four, I bclie\"e, girls, and Fred Davis were in attendance at the club's meeting that week but I missed them at the Reunion. Undoubtedly, there were many others whom I failed to see and I apol­ogize for omitting their names. I am asking Dick Donoghue to check ray list and supple­ment it if he can and if I get any results. I'll break out again in correspondence. 
"Everyone of the boys I spoke to is looking forward to the 1940 reunion at school and I am sure you can count on a big dele­gation from the cast. 
"On the trip down to Baltimore for the Navy game the following week. Dick Dono­ghne, Frank Dunn and Hank Frcy and yours truly represented the class and continutnl the festivities of the week before. While in Balti­more, we met Frank Walker, who is Attorney General Cummtng's right hand, and who keeps sending me pamphlets on home making in order to get me to vote for the Democratic candidates for the Senate and House. If FVank's boss sees this, I'm only fooling. 

"Later: I have been in touch with Dick 

•Donoghne as I promised, and he advises rae that also present at the party from the class of 1930 were Jack Cassidy and Frank Mosher, both working in the city, as well as Tom Lisztwan, who originally hailed from Vermont. Dick also tells me that Gas Bond! and Bill Wabh, whom I saw at the game, were both nt the party. 
"Others include Jim Mnlvaney, of Auburn. New York, Johnny Law, down from his su­perintendent job at Woodburne, Chick O'Mal-Icy, up from the wilds of Scranton, and Tom Bradley, who succeeded in making the long trek from Riverdale in the Bronx." 
STILL LATER: 
"This constitutes my second supplemental letter relative to the 1930 reunion at the Army game party. I am sending it for my own protection, as much as for the news value, in view of the threats I have received if class­mates then present are not mentioned. 
"Hrst of the new men on the list is Tim O'Rourke, the Astoria executive, who was there with bells on having received a 12 o'clock 'per* from his wife; also Gene Ken­nedy, John NaiiDvic and Andy Aman, appar­ently all the way from Ohio. Howie Smith came down from Pclham where he had a very successful year coaching Jit. St. Michael's Prep School. You should have heard the gloating when his team beat Jack Lavclle's All Hallows* club, 7-G. 
"I forgot to mention an interesting experi­ence with relation to the game on seeing a picture of John Dubuisson's brother as a mem­ber of the Army team playing in the back­field. The picture is the image of John, onb* obviously better looking, and when the lineup showed him to be from Opelousas, Louisiana, I was convinced that one of John's family had finally made something of himself. I do not understand how John let him get away from our club, but Army is certainly a good second choice. The boy played very well against ns and will probably be a real threat for the next two years." 
Bob Hcllrung is here again with a lot of dope for you. He says: 
"By way of supplement to Warren FOKCI'S article on the New York Reunion, for which I am duly appreciative, you may have the following tidbits of news from your St. Louis •correspondent. 
"First, congratulations are in order for "Waren and the rest of the gang in New York who were responsible for the success of that Reunion. 
"On December 3, the 'thirties' of California and the west coast are to follow suit and will hold a class reunion in Los Angeles, in con­nection with the U.S.C. game, with Doug Daley in charge. Doug, by the way, is hono­rary president of the Notre Dame Club of Los Angeles, and will be in charge of the en­tire show. The next issue of the ALUMNUS wiil carry his graphic description of the «ntire affair 'play by play.' 
"During the past month, your correspondent "has heard from Jack "Red" Flynn, sounding like a voice from the wilderness, all the way from that land of sand and cactus, Prescott. Arizona. Jack is a bacteriologist, chasing "bugs in his father's clinical laboratory. He tells nie that Eddie Collins, from Oak Park, Illinois, who spent a summer in Prescott sev­eral years ago. is the only Notre Dame man he has seen 'in those parts' » . . and what's more, all he sees are health-seekers, gold-mine promoters, revenue officers, cattle thieves, and rattle snakes. However, Jack and Mrs. Flynn are going to gallop out to Los Angeles to sec Ihe Notre Dame crowd at the U.S.C. game. 
*'LarrT Cotter, an architect of this class of '30, who hails from Buffalo. New York, is now permanently situated here in St. Louis with the architectural firm of O'Meara & Hills. Larry comes to us with high laurels gained in New York City, after seven years experience designing skyscrapers. liorry is unattached, quite eligible, and, if any of you boys have beautiful sisters *in v.-aiting.' you may send him a bid at 5709 Waterman, St. Louis. Mis­souri. 
"Larr^- Cronin, of Blmira, New York, spent about seven years in New York City, as a spe­cial agent for the Prudential Life Insurance 
• Company. "We understand that he is now back in Elmira. insurancing everybody in the old home town. 
"Here's n surprising parcel of news: Jim Shechy, who hailed from Syracuse, New York, and graduated in engineering in '30, decided that he would rather work on the human body than on a steel structure. A year and a half ago, Jim walked out of Duke University with a diploma in medicine, and is now interning in New York City at St. Vincent's Hospital. 
"In closing, here's a suggestion: if all of you 'thirties' are too modest to write your correspondent about yourselves, please let me hear from your press agents. 
"Yours for a national championship." 

Walter Langford, gifted young professor of Spanish at the University, has launched into an extensive literary career somewhat unin­tentionally. Professor Langford, whose sum­mers have been spent in Mexico attending the university in Mexico City, is a most able ex­ponent of Mexican history, both ancient and contemporarj'. Interest in Mexico has brought a demand for Walter's articles, and in the month of November just passed, "The Sign" carried an article on the economic crisis; "The Missionary" carried an article on Mexico's martyr. Father Pro, and "The Ave Maria" carried an analysis of the implications of the reorganization of the olTicial government po­litical party. Walt has articles coming out in "St. Francis Home Journal," "The Little Missionary." and "The Ave Maria." 
1931 Secretary: John Bergan, 838 E. Col­fax Ave.. South Bend. Ind-
Hero is great stuff from one of the best ^^^nchelIs in the business, your Mr. Bergan: 
"The class seemed to be well represented at the Southern Cal game when our scout saw the Tom Ashes, the Matt Cnllinans, the Paul Cushings. Korm Hcrwit. Ted Strong, Joe Gnmd­nola, Ed Thichem, Paul Enright, Francis Hen­nebergcr and Ed Shceran. At the Minnesota game were: Vcm Knox. Ben Oakes. Red Calla-Khan. Walt Murphy, Jim Griffin, AI Ferguson, Nick BohUng, Joe Monizzo, Bill Desenberg, John Mclntyrc. Clarence Futter and Eddie Ryan, along with many others who were not in view when the game ended. 
"Harry Langton has been making rapid strides as sales manager for the Dictograph Products Company in Dallas, Texas, and re­cently led the nation in sales. Paul Grmnt is still busy in the Mattoon branch of the Illinois Public Service company and at home with the care of the second Grant heir bom last month. The Jerry Crowleys are now residing in South Bend nnd bid a hearty welcome to any of the class to pay them a visit when in the vicinity. Al Stcpan is peddling chemicals and recently has taken. over new territory in the Northwest. Ed Hosinski has forsaken the tire business for a sales job with the New York Lamp Co. Frank Brown was recently elected to oFtice in Pennville. Indiana. Bad Totthy, the Long Island barrister, has recent­ly recovered from a serious illness and is back at his practice once more. 
"Bob Bluscy is a field man for the dnPont Company in Wilmington, Delaware. JI M Boardc«v is in Saranac Lake, New York, as­sisting his father in the meat packing busi­ness. Frank HcGrcal has opened his own law office in the 10 liaSalle Building, Ghtcaso, after a two-year tenure with the Chicago ^tl e and Trust Co.

Pat has two children. Frank Kopinski was elected justice of the peace for the South Bend district in the No­vember election and will assume office on January 1. 
"Sorrow again visited the class early in November when Brother John, C.S.C.. died in Dacca, India. Brother John, who received his bachelor of science degree with the class, had spent four years as principal of the Congre­gation of Holy Cross school in Dacca, and had been doing wonderful work as a missionary. A Mass was said for the repose of his soul at the request of the class. 
"Bad Tuohy relates the following anent '31 class members in New York for the Army week-end: 
** 'Bob Pendergast was here for both busi­ness and pleasure, with the latter in the fore­ground; Dick Lacy, who is here in N.Y.C. working for the Travelers Insurance Company: Dan Williams, also in New York as an attor­ney with an insurance company; John Foley, who has forsaken law and is teaching up Tarrytown way; Dick Donoghoe, who had a big hand in raaldng the pre-game rally the great success it was. Others we saw — and there are some I've probably forgotten — were Dave Nash. Charley *'Kid" Spinelli, Jack Saandcrs, Dick Barber, Rye barrister; Ed Caningham. AI Howard, Ben Cakes, Bob Masscy, Johnny Byrnes, and Roy Bailey.' 
"There is still an opening in this depart­ment for many news reports of class members who have been absent from this column for the past seven years. We urge some news from the absentees so that we may pass on their achievements and whereabouts." 
Lonis Heitger, who has been at Muskegon, Michigan, has gone to the Atlanta, Georgia, headquarters of the E. H. Sheldon Company.

Don Wbe has heard from Tony Wallace, who passed the Pennsylvania bar and was ad­mitted on October 17. Don also writes that Manty Scanlon is a division manager for the American Tobacco Company. 
1934 Secretary: James Moscow, 2320 Korth Lawndale Ave., Chicago, I0fiiofi 
Jim Moscow, of good old Providence Mutual, comes through after a long absence: 
"I regret having been such a 'scoopless* re­porter for so long but, truly, news of the '34 group is about as scarce as Chicago Maroons* football victories. 
"First of all I would like to catch up on a fe%v marriages. Last June found Andy Auth 

The Notre Dame Alumnus 
being linked with Miss Nellie HcCormick in Washington. In the same month Miss Lucile Buckley, the sister of Jack BKddey of our class, became the bride of Ed Fiiher. It la rn­mored that Erwin Kelp is soon to take on a Notre Dame class of '34 brother-in-law also. Incidentally, Erp most recently has taken over an important Missouri district for the Ameri­can Drugmsts Syndicate. This column would like him to put 'the bee' on Landers Hmnnott and a few more for a line now and then. 
"Coming back to wedding we find that Bill O'Brien of Connecticut (was it Bridgeport or New Ha\-en ?) was maried to iSiss Marie Siegmann in Pulaski, Tennessee, on August

"John Kiely is the proud daddy of a Pati'Ick James — Congratulations, Betty and Jack. 
"Charley Schwartzel was a most welcome visitor to Chicago last September. Still faith­ful to New Albany, Indiana. Charley reports a booming basket business in the nearby states in which he operates. 
"Jimmy Dunnigan announces the formation of a law partnership of Dwyer, Gold, Kennedy, and Dunnigan. They operate from 41 East 42nd Street in New York City. Good luck, Jim, and please forget the suit for my not acknowledging this sooner. 
"Another Jim, namely Keams, continues his rapid strides as a popular sports columnist for the 'Chicago Daily News.' It seems like old times to us Chicagoans to be reading Jim's accounts of Irish football games. 
"Food for* thought: Only six months, until our five-year-reunion! Just thought I'd men­tion it so some of you boys can start working on the wives for a week-end 'per.'" 
Much more than welcome is this swell letter from the guy who must certainly rate as the most courageous member of the class — Georce Belting: 
"After reading Ed Moran's 'wee bit' of in­formation in the current issue of the ALUM* NUS concerning the members of the class of '34, there is little to be added. However. I have heard directly or indirectly from a few of the boys that Ed didn't sec in his globe trotting, and am jiassing on the news. 
"At the present time I am completing my twenty-eighth month in hospitals or sanatari­ums in a fight against a swell case of tuber­culosis. The prospects at this time are very good, but it will be quite a while yet before t can be up and around. At the moment I am recovering, from two thorocoplasty operations, in which a total of seven ribs were removed. Now, as the surgeon told me, I would be a real halfback for Elmer Layden, literally speaking. But everything is coming along fine now—thanks to all the Masses and prayers that were offered for me. My goal now IS to be back to school for our firet re­union. Right now it is doubtful if I will be able to make it, but they can't shoot a fellow for hoping, can they? 
"Now about some of the other '34ers. Joe Hanratty was in the auditor's office of the city of Parma. Bob Rainey transferred from his home town of Peoria to Chicago, where he is Eoine great jguns. Bob has been a most faithful correspondent during my incar­ceration, and from bis letters the following has come to light. Jack Greiser is making Peoria and vicinit>- PalmoHve soap conscious. Vince Rickey is proprietor of his own grocery store in the same city and doing right well, thank you. BUI Motsett is with his dad in the laundry business in Peoria. 
"Coins out West we find Gene Blish creat­

G.H.Q. at Davenport. Iowa. Joe Clark, ex. '34, is postmaster at Natrona, Penn^Ivania, and holds an office in one of the postmasters' na­tional organizations. Jim Gleason is insuring everyone in Lima, New York, through his own agency, for the Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance Company. Bill Reilly, of the East Orange, New Jersey, Reillys, was married last spring and is doin? re-\vrite for the Newark 'Star-Eagle.' Bill Manard, the old roomie from Buf­falo, who has been down to Cleveland to see me a few times, is with one of the large steel companies in Lackawanna. New York. Tom Brobson, also of Buffalo, is a travelling rep­resentative for the Dennison Manufacturing Company. The last I heard from Jim Gart­land he was doing" social service work in Washington, D.C. 
"Well, that's all the news for this time. Tell the boys that I would be more than happy to hear from them. I have plenty of time on my hands and nothing to do with it. I may be reached at 3Iount Royal Sanatarium, Brecks\'ille, Ohio. Incidentally, if any of the boys ever set to Cleveland and have a few hours to spare, I would be delighted to see them. The sanatarium is only about 12 miles southwest of Cleveland." 
A letter from Los Angeles, from Ben Alex­ander, informs us that Nick Lakats is the greatest actor out there, and that Jack Car-berry is now in charge of letting that fact leak out for Nick.

1935 Secreury: FranMyn C Hockretter, 610 Rodd Street, Midland. BCcUsvi. 
Here, friends of the ALUMNUS audience, is a miracle. The cloud-walkine Hochreiter turns out a column for you. Take it away, suh, with the best wishes of the staff: 
"Here we are again, gang, but this time we have a new headliner for the first shot out of the journalistic gun. 
"Since the bethrothed and the scribe became ^•ery tired of making week-end jumps to carry on a romance, they both grabbed off healthy positions when they presented themselves in the same town. Tlie next column comes from New Orleans, Louisiana, where Mr. and Mrs. Franklyn Hochreiter will be enjoying mixed French and Spanish culture, with a remnant of Huey Long. 
"The date — December 2S. The place — Mt, St. Marj-'s Academy chapel, Kenmore, N. Y. ' The official witness — Rev, Thomas J. Bren­nan, C.S.C. The bride — Miss Qara Ann Ball of Buffalo, New York. The lucky person — definitely yours truly, — not the bride. The day after the wedding takes us to the sunny warm climes of New Orleans where Mrs. Hochreiter becomes chief psychiatric social worker of the new Child Guidance Institute, and the 'little man* takes over another ven­ture in probation. The Louisiana address is not known at time of writing, so yon can still send those epistles to the Midland number until we give further notice. Once we are settled down New Orleans way we'll be ex­pecting to see that southern contingent real 

often — that means Saleh, Gravel, Jacobs. etc. 
"And now to the correspondence of the month. Things began picking up and we have three meaty epistles from which to draw our chatter. But first a note on Bill Mraser. While home over the Thanksgiving holiday we ran into Bill in the Terrace Room of the Statler. The WilliamvUle Adonis is teach­ing at the local high school, looks very healthy and seems to have grown more serious in his professorial status. 
'*T^vo letters from the east arrived on the same day — one from Vermont and one from New York City. We'll take them in order. 
"The New England missive was a welcome messenger from Ed Bricd. Ed is head of the Chemistry Department of St. Michael's Col­lege in Winooski Park, Vermont. Let's trace through his history since we left him in the gym back in June. 1935. 
"After graduation Ed spent a year at the University of Cincinnati in the graduate school of chemical engineering. Then he returned to 
N.D. and received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in chemistrj- at the last summer session. Upon receiving the sheepskin Ed took the first train for St. Petersburg. Flor­ida, and was married there to Miss Martha Louise Ice. of Fairmont, West Vir^nia and St. Petersburg. Two weeks of travel in the southern states brought the Brieds to Bur­lington, Vermont, where Ed had previously accepted a position at St. Michael's as head of their chemistry department. 
"Much felicitations on your success, Ed, and 

on your marriage. They certainly placed you 
on 'top of the heap' and right in the front lines of the '35 advance guard of matrimony. May your success and happiness continue and become fuller as the years roll on. 
"With Ed at St. Michael's are two more Notre Dame men. Father J. T. Purtill, M.A. '37, is dean of studies, and Joe Degnan. '34. is also a member of the faculty and in charge of publicity. As a point of information, Ed 
— we are not with Dow. though the plant controls everything in these parts. We are working until December 17 for a private board and the state, in social work. 
"Next we move on a news summary sent in by Frank Sinnott. After taking a crack at the law. and deciding to go straight instead, the Bronx Dapper Dan swung over to Ford­ham Graduate School and hit out for an M.A. in English. At the present writing all looks well for Frank's capturing the degree next year. In the interim between law and grad­uate work, Frank looked into the business world and found it wanting. 
"In the New York letter came some very valuable dope on several of our crowd of whom we have heard little these past few years. For it, Frank, we are deeply grateful. 
"Bob Simmons is going to town in Roches­ter. New York, where he is associated with his Dad in business. But the Simmons* boy re­fuses to give up the books. We hear he does a little studying on the side. 
"Believe it or not, but Charlie Bragrg, also of Rochester, is employed by the Keystone Supply Company and is dispensing bricks and other building material. 
"We have heard a lot about the 'big town sharper* but did not run into him during our year on Manhattan Island. Not so fortunate were Barney English and Bob Simmons last summer when they were relieved of their lug­gage while their car was parked. 
"Frank writes that Vince Gorman is in the city but they seldom meet. We recall passing on the info that Vince was headed Cornell-ward for medicine this year. How about it, Vince — are you ever going to take us up on our pleas for a line about yourself? 
"For those of the gang who are down Ford­ham way, how about stopping in for a moment with friend Stnnott? He's available at 305 Dealy Hall. 

"You know we get about one or two letters a year from Frank Holahan* but when the:; come through they arc chuck full of real news. Awaiting our return from turkey in Buffalo at Thanksgiving was a long missive \vritten in the Montrose Inn in Pennsylvania. We give you the swell dope that our Bank Examiner put on the wire for us. 
"Frank was down to New York Ci^ for the Army game but saw very few of the '35 mob. Attending the game with Frank and his feminine companion were Adrian Wacker-man and his fair one. Since last heard from Adrian has joined up with another architec­tural firm in Philadelphia. This was a recent change, and from all reports, the little blonde genuis of the slide rule and India ink is really pitching. During the summer Wacker-man flew out to Chi to do the honors as best man at the wedding of Frank Leonard. 
"The only other '35er seen at the game by Frank was Joe Schmidt whom he met as he was leaving the stadium. No information on Joe. 
"\Vhile making the \*ictory more gala by a little N.Y.C. night life, the correspondent ran into Ned Rowan at the Picadilly. Ned has been working for the Commonwealth, pending his return to Georgetown Law School in the near future. 
"Ned passed on the news that Bob Henne­bergcr is no longer in Washington and that the latest grapevine code has him in the home town in Illinois. 
"Pending verification we give you the hear­say on Ray Brodcrick. Ray is reputed to be on the payroll of one of the federal agencies in the capitol. We are not sure if this is still the story since Ray passed the Pennsylvania bar. How about the details, Ray, via a letter? 
"Frank writes that when he was in Minne­apolis a few months back he again endeav­ored to contact his old Presbytery roomie, Danny McLaughlin but with little success. Rumor has it that Dan is continuing to su­perintend a road gang in the summer and take law at Minnesota in the winter. Dan Is booked to take the LL.6. this year. 
"On one of his flying trips home to Gales-burg, our e.\aminer saw Tom Graves, who is on the sports staff of the local newspaper. ^Vhile in the home territory, word was about that 'Scorp' Hallberg is stiff auditing for the state. 
"Of Jack Pendergast there is chatter that he has been in the throes of adjusting to Cali­fornia sunshine and orange groves. The at­traction talcing Jack west is not known. A note. Jack? 
"Another '35er to add to our column of those in wedlock is 'Roundy* Posue, who is reported married and enjoying it, together with a good position in Chicago. 
"While in Sayre. Pennsylvania, a few weeks back, Frank called Aaron Hamm at Bing­hamton. New York. Aaron, at the present rolling of the press, is drawing a check from \VPA as engineer in the vicinity of southern New York. 
"Hold your breath, fetlas — here is word on Phil Jacobs! He actually writes letters occasionally, even if it be to Holahmn instead of the scribe. Imagine Phil still holding down that bank position down there in the home town ia Louisiana. We'll be expecting to see yoa after the first of the year, Phil. 
"A last bit of news frora Frank informs us that Al DftTid recently went to Venezuela for the Gulf Oil Company to remain for at least two years. 
"For oar three corresi>ondents we say from the heart 'gratiasl' You have brought the picture up to date for a lot of the gang of whom we have heard nothing for a long time. Now, how about the rest of the crowd break­ing loose with a letter or a penny ]>ost card? Let's get going and hit out stride again I This month brings us back into the swing, and next time we want to fill one full page in the old monthly. What do you say — are you willing?

193 6 ^e-retary: John Horan 61 E. 95tb 3U, Apt. 2, New York City. Great stuff, this Is, following Johnny** Army week-end. Here we go: 
"By the time these notes reach print, the football season will be just a memory, yet here we are reporting on the gang' that came to New York to see Notre Dame beat Army on October 29. So many '3Gers flowed in and out of town that week-end that at this late date you'll have to pardon us if we accident­ally overlook a few. Get angry enough to w^rite and call the matter to our attention — we'll be glad to hear from you. But no law suits, please. 
"The festivities started Friday evening with a brilliant array of ^;}eakers attracting a smashing turnout of 1,200 N.D. rooters to the Grand Ballroom of the Hotel Pennsylvania for a pre-game Reunion and Rally. Promi­nent on the committees responsible for the success of the affair were Bad Goldman and Joe Schmidt who worked on the publicity. Gathered around the tables reserved for *36 were Dan SalUvan who reported that he is now with the printing department of the In­ternational Tailoring Company in New York, and August "Sunny" Charcfa, economics stu­dent par excellence. 
**Dan revealed that his old side kick. Bob Stapp, has gone west end, is now doing very well on the editorial staff of a newspaper in or near Denver, Colorado. A little more infor­mation is in order. Bob. Sunny is putting-into practice the Distributive Justice precepts Father Bolder pounded into our respective skulls. His boast is that he and his Dad operate one of North Flainfield, New Jersey's, largest grocery stores where every one of the eight clerks receives a substantial living wage. He also admitted to having journeyed altar-ward last January. 
"Joe Ratican was present to listen to Grantland Rice, Gene Tunney, et al. and in­cidentally to inform us that he returned from his European vacation jaunt in time to con­tinue with his medieval literature studies at Pennsylvania. Joe reported that Dave Flynn. whose correct address was recently requested in these columns for the Alumni Association, has been confined to the Springbroofce Sani­tarium, Aurora, Illinois, for the last year and a half. Joe has been out twice to visit Dave who has been fighting a winning battle against tuberculosis. Best of luck; Dave, and we trust that you will be recovered sufficiently to be on hand for next year's game. How about a letter to Dave, boys? 
"Jim ^wrry was around frantically huntinsr 

for someone with an extra ticket for the gmne 
next day. Slickcy Dendler, who deserted his 
law books at the TIniversitj- of Pennsylvania 
to spend the week-end with your correspon­
dent, pulled an extra one of the little paste­
boards out of his sleeve, and big Jim almost 
wept on his neck. Sherry reported that Inst 
September he and Gene Tobin drove from Chi-
cag:o to Tatr>-town, New York, where Jim 
keeps the books of the Chevrolet plant in 
order. The trip, which began on Friday, ended 
on the following "Wednesday with stops in be­
tween to visit Tom Campbell and Johnny 
Brovcer in Grand Rapids. Jim reported that 
Tobin is connected with the Internal Revenue 
office in Chicago, that Art Hubcr is doing ac­
counting work for Chevrolet in Norwood, 
Ohio, and that Luke Ticman, now with the 
International Business Machines in Chicago, 
may be assigned to Endicott. New York, th:s 

fall. Also that Abe Shore, now working for 
a public accountins firm in Chicago, has a 

baby boy a year old, and that AI Bohl is an 
insurance broker in Chicago. 
"Also at the rally were a number of famil­iar faces from New York including Bill Walsh, Bud Goldman, Jim Kiiby. Joe Donnina, Andy Hnfnagel, Dtck Campbell, Jim Reilly and Joe Schmidt. Joe, incidentally, was recently awarded the Doc Sa»-age Medal for his work in connection with the Knights of Columbus boy moveemnt. %\Tiat the gang in and around New York wants to know is how you can set a erood example to the youngsters yet run around with steel tj'coon's and railroad • magnate's daughters over the Army game week-end. and date Toby Wing at the Inter­national Casino? 
"Following the game Saturday, we ran into most of the gang from *3G in the Hotel Penn­sylvania. Joe Weiss was there to report that he is now taking law at Detroit, and doing very well. Chuck Boylc and Lee Moorman were there, too, still grumbling in their whis­kers because your secretary didn't vote their way back in the class elections in 19351 Lee, after finishing up at Notre Dame this past June, is now practicing law in Detroit, we be­lieve. Chuck dug himself out of the Minne­sota snowdrifts to catch the dog sled for New York and the game. He was too busy be­moaning that lost vote to tell what be is doing for a living. Probably still kissing babies and giving out cigars for some other candidate. 
"Paul Cummings was around wanting to know why he didn't get his ticket application blanks in time for the game. Honestly, Paul, after spending the last couple of games be­hind the goal posts, we w-ould even like to know how you crash that magic circle that gets as far as the 20-yard line! Paul is still with the American Can Company in Brooklyn. 
"Charley Clark was on hand to state that 

his work at Fordham I*aw^ School's night ses­sion keeps him from attending more club meetings. Charley reported that there was a rumor to the effect that Moose Kennedy had got married sometime in September, 1938. If true. Moose, how about a verification—and a little news from Nick Tancrcdi would be in order, too. There was also a rumor that Pete . Kowaczek had married in Chicago. How about 
that, Pete? 
"Tom Grady, the old drum major from Chi­cago, was around to point out the disadvan­tages of sleeping in a day coach. Tom is still with that meat packing outfit in the Windy City. 
"Also seen at one time or other during the week-end were Nick Casillo. who is going to law school in Brooklyn, {don't sue us if that is wrong, Nick), Jack Skelly, Dan Hanrahan, Biff Flannery, Bill Shea and several others. Among the many whom we didn't have the 
pleasure of greeting personally were Wayne Millner, who retired early as he was scheduled to start at end for the Washington Redskins the following day, and Joe Mansfield, the dem­on announcer from FroviBence. 
"Joe dropped us a line after the game to let us know that he had been in town but had missed us. Joe is still announcing for WJAR. Providence, Rhode Island, and during the re­cent hurricane worked on a 24-hour shift. He was sent out to the stricken areas to broadcast description work. Joe writes that while in New York he saw Maniy Quinn, now practic­ing law in Buffalo, Roman Belmont, Joe Mac> Donald, who is still with the Western Union here in the Metropolis, and Father KeUer. Sorry, Joe, but I don't know Shetb Herrick's address, but if the gentleman in question reads this he can reach Mrs. Jilansfield's little boy by writing WJAR. 

**Joe Prcndcrgast, who teamed with your secretao' and had a lot of fun worrying about those 'Scholastic' deadlines in '3o-*36. came on from Illinois to see the game. Joe is now doing editorial work for a publishing concern and reports that the Mid-West isn't so bad (coming from a New Knglander that is al­most treason). Joe pulled through a case of pneumonia last year and is now fit and ready again. 
"And that about winds up the 1938 Army game. In the mail this month was a card announcing the marriage of AI Torribio to Miss Vista Hosking on Friday, November 4, at Trinidad, Colorado. Congratulations and best wishes, AI. The ncwiyweds will be at home by this time at 3706 East Fourth, Los Angeles, California. From last reports we be­lieve that AI is doing social service work in California. 
"Joe Newman wrote in from Baltimore in answer to our request for some information regrarding his whereabouts. Joe is working for the Bureau of Records, Social Security Board, and reports that he is married and the proud father of a year old girl. Congrat­ulations. Joe disclosed that Merril Clements is super\'isor of the accounting department for the Standard Life Association Company in Lawrence, Kansas. Joe wants to hear from Fred Deichmann, who was last reported in charge of the Equitable Life Agency at Santa Monica. California. Newman can be reached at 3726 Beehler Avenue, Baltimore. 
"George Miller is in line for congratulations 

— the reason being George M. Miller, 3rd, who weighed 8 pounds. 11 ounces when he took his first look at Anamoose, North Dakota, on November 12. According to George's card, the youngster's chief occupation is being nd­mlred, and his chief accomplishments are largely vocal. George wTites that he is now operating a liquor store in Anamoose. 
"The heavy Thanksgiving snowfall did not deter us from leaving for Philadelphia and ih^ Army-Navy game on November 26. While in the Quaker City we enjoj-ed our stay with Mickey Dendler, who finishes up his law work at Pennsj'lvania this June. With Mickey, we stopped around to the editorial department of the Philadelphia 'Record* to see Lin Phoebns. Lin confirmed our story in the last issue that he was married July, 5, 1938, in the Cathedral in Philadelphia. At the present time he can be reached at Apartment 5, Fretz Building, 7th and Market Streets, Perkasia, Pennsyl­vania. 
"And that winds up the column for this month. We leave you all with our sincerest wishes for a Merry Christmas and a profitable and successful New Year. And if you hapi>en to remember, drop us a Christmas card this year. We would particularly like to hear from the following: Don Draper, Frands Dann, Dick Eckridi, Bro. Dominic Elder, Don Elscr, Ed Eppler, Bob Ervin, Bill Fay, Bill Fieweger, Pat Hsiier, Jim Fitzgerald. Joe Fitzmaarice, and Charlie Fitzsimmons." 
Class of '36 members \rill .regret to learn of the serious illness of Carlos P. Romnio, distinguished Philippines publisher, who de­livered the great oration on government at the Roosevelt Convocation in December, 1935, and was, together with the President, awarded an honorary LL.D., at the time. 
Frank Wade has joined the roster of the Bendix Brakes, one of the fast basketball units in the semi-pro. Johnny Moir and Paul Nowak of last year's squad, are on the Akron, Ohio, Firestones, in the same circuit. 

That there is a field for the placement ser­vice is evident in the fact that Jack Bruwn, '38, is working for the newly organized radio station "WTBC in Brown City. Mich., and, directly through the placement ser\'ice. was recently joined in that organization by Carmi Belmont, who had been here at the University doing some work and writing a master's thesis. 
1937 SecreUry: Paul Foley, 44 Hampton Road, Grosse Point, Midiigan. Tilings being what they are, you're lucky to have Foley with you for this spasm. Take it away; "Three days late on the deadline and the day after the Trojan horse bared its fangs into what was meant to be a succulent na­tional title — but then, the boys saw^ the Coast. "First comes word from South Bend through our medium, one Harry Kochlcr, Jr.. who re­ports on many of the lads in the vicinity of Hook's. Koehler, who was with the South Bend Lathe works, reports that he spent the summer as an interior decorator, while most of us were scrambling around to patch up the exterior. 
**Tom Lucky is still with Jones and Dabny Paint Company, in Louisville, Kentucky, and was married last April, which I think we re­ported earlier. It is said (by Koehler) that the paint business is hotter than a $2 pistol and eveo'thing is hunk>'-dory in Louis\'iIIe. We are waiting for confiramtion of this re­port from Emil J, 'Narcissus' Peter. 
"Karl King: is reported doing well as an accountant in the Bend, while Bud Mix is mix­ing it in Indianapolis. Both these lads, ac­cording to Koehler. are keeping a sharp eye on the fast ones and doing very well indeed. 
"Another of the South Benders, this one a protege of Doctor CfKiney's hot-box, 3IiIton Bock, is still at home and covering a beat for the South Bend *Ne\vs-Times.' On the same pink sheet is Edward Fischer, also one who panted for knowledge, and got it. at the hitching post of Journalism in the Library basement. 
**Koeh!er reports on Morris Moskowitz, but the best he can do in the way of information is that Morris is up, around and able to take a little nourishment, he isn't sure how Morris is occupied. Gene Mullen is reported still with the Carnegie Steel Corporation, in Chica­go. Milton Katz is also sUlPin South Bend, and is doing bookkeeping for Gilbert's clothing store. James Payton is also employed in the Bend and works for the Associates Building. Payton, incidentally, is, or was, passing out cigars with paternal pride. 
**Lonu Hickey, we are told, is in the under­taking business with his brother. 
"Now for a bit of first hand information. Snagging a ducat when the last dog was being led to the scaffold, we managed to make the Minnesota same, saw a flock of the boys, wan­dered in disbelief about the campus and will try to remember some of the eoings on. 
"Among those jammed into the stadium (we trust), were Paul Sheedjr, still hitting the ball in Snyder, N- Y. (yes. Katie Phillip-son was nearby). Jim Moulder was also on hand, dapper as a duke and brought word of Tom Condon and the rest of the Buffalo con­tingent. Tom recently hooked up with an in­surance firm in Buffalo and is said to be inur­ing everything in sight. 
"Geographical notes: You should fake a gander at the new candy store! Everything in stock from Little Liver Pills to big choc­olate malteds in paper pails. It's the McCoy and no mistake. We are sorry to report that we gulped up a malted and a 'Dainty Delight Pimento Cheese and Pineapple' sandwich, without once seeing a tattered suede jacket and a voice bellowing for milk and cholocate graham. 'O tempera, O mores!' Even the cigaret displays in crepe paper have gone Finchley. 
"Then downtown. We like to drive right smack through South Bend because they went and streamlined the front of Hook's so it looks like a cross between the Burlington Zephyr and a new gas stove. But they haven't stream­lined the lads in front nor the South Benders who arc so fondly gazed at by said gentle­men. 
"Others on hand for the 10-0 affair were Jack Hurley, with whom we talked just brief­ly ; 'Slick' Emmett Hart, fresh from big busi­ness machinations; Henry Rucn, the proud papa; John Ullman, not a proud papa, but working for one; Roy Barron and Bob Sieg­fried, together ns usual, and with whom we managed to palaver only briefly. 
"From our Eastern representatives comes all kinds of glad tidings. Most of them date back almost as far as the Army game, and you know what that means. 
"Vie are told that Charles Roggcnstcin, of the Rockville Centre Roggensteins, now tips the beam at 174 and was at Columbia Law School. We deem it wise to say no more of the Law School. 
"With Roggenstein at the same institution was James Waldron, who is still battling the books, and we are sure will triumph. 
"Cousin Joe O'Neill was at Temple Law school, imother school career we will refrain from reviewing. We are told, but hesitate to report, that O'Neill is working. Such may be the case, but we would like to see the handle of the pick. 
**Jae Quinn was reported temporarily out of a post, hut will no doubt, smile his way back into one. possibly before this type is even set. Cy Stroker, the Scholastic's beat managing editor during 193G-1937, is reported doing very well on the Rist coast, as everyone knew he would. 
"Freddy Cast is said to be working for a company in Beacon. New York, where he is employed as a chemist and is said to be dotns right well with the tubes and potions. John Campbell and Larry Burnett are medical stu­dents in Philadelphia. 
"The Har\'ard trio, consisting mainly of John Marbach. Harrj* Baldwin and George I^ane. is heard from only indirectly and we presume the boys are still absorbing culture, etc.. under the ivy. 'Pee Wee' Hardart and *Mnd Bob* Gchres are studying medicine at Columbia. They were all in New York some­where about the time of the Army game. 
"We toport for what it is worth, the bare skeleton of a story of Jack Gillespie. Jack Byrne and 'Yussel Joe* Moore. They are said to have batted about New York quite proper­ly. ISIoore, incidentally, had a rip-roaring season with a high school football club he is coaching; Byrne is heir apparent for the Snuggie crown and Gillespie is joumalizins at Westfield. 
"From outside the Mazda Belt, we journey in a flash to Arkansas, where a flash means what it flashes. Bob Puryear. our plains cor­respondent, is working in and out of Jonesboro with the Puryear Grocery Company. 
"At tlie Minnesota game we also saw a good many of the Chicago contingent reported on rather regularly. Frank Lessclyong, from way up in the copper country, now of Chi., tells us he is temporarily stalled, but appeared not the least depressed. 
"It also seems that Frank Geddes. of the Windy City, is, or was, in a marrj'ing mood. We hesitate to report an actual wedding be­cause we can't remember Lesselyong's conver­sation, interupted by many, many side is­sues. Yeah bo! 
"This will stagger to a close of .this canto, remembering that the frost is on the pump­kin, the yule log has been hewn, and Santa Glaus and his thousands of brothers have been banging the tambourines for lo these many days. We are happy to report that on this, our second Christmas away from the Golden Dome, most of the boys seem to be happily situated, some have had disaptraint­ments. at least one of our members has died —but in a true sense of thankfulness for what we have in common, we wish everyone of '37 a truly Merry Christmas and a joyous New Year. Jeeves, the plum pudding and a bit of tinsel — 'tis the Yuletide." 
William V. Jordan is working in South Bend with the J. C. Pennej' Company, and taking the opportunity to finish his thesis for his M.A. 
Robert IL Siegfried won a distinction with his appointment as secretary of the State In­surance Board in Oklahoma. Bob is associated with his father in the insurance business. The Board, consisting of only three members, has full and complete charge of some 17,000 agent licenses and the enforcement of state insur­ance laws for some 600 companies operating there. The apiwintment to the board is made by the governor of the state, and Bob is the first Tulsan. the youngest man, and the first Catholic appointed to the important post. Carl Sengcr sends in a letter. 
1938 Secretary: Harold A. Williams, 216 East Lake Ave., Baltimore, Maryland. 
This, my kind friends, is the Willjanu ALUMNUS for December. Settle down for a couple of hours and read on: 
"On November I, in the hope of getting some information from various sections of the class, I mailed post cards to Steve Dietrich, Jack Simon, Hugh Correll, Jim Blunt, Frank Dctscher, Pierre de la Vcrgne, Rus Fitzgerald, Spud O'Brien, John Sfurrin, Gus Sidler. George Sautar. Rus Redgatc and Vernon Ruge. 
"So far I have had three replies. Steve Dietrich writes, 'I am now working for the Trenton "Times" where I hold the position of manager of the Merchandising Department. I make contacts for national advertisers. For instance, Chesterfield (plug) writes to the paper wanting to know how they, sell com­pared with other cigarettes. I then cover the required number of stores and get the data from them. It keeps me quite busy. I have been with the paper since the first of October, and like it very much.' 
" *As for any other information, I am mar­ried and have been since January, 1936. That's one on the boys of Notre Dame. Hy wife is here with me and we're getting along swell.* 
" T m sorry that I could not get this infor­mation to you any sooner, and am sure you understand. In the futtire ycu may reach me at 43 Evans Avenue, Trenton, New Jersey.' Congratulations, Steve, and shame on you for keeping us in the dark so long. 
"Hugh Correll replied to the post card in> qniry in this fine way, 'Received your card a few days ago and determined to reward your investment with a reply. Iliere is nothing to offer as far as any personal information is concerned. I am still unemployed and begin­ning to wonder when, if ever, something will break. I am not without hope, however, for I have a few good things in mind that might turn out for the best. Time will tell and goodness knows I have plenty of that.* 
" 'Took a trip East this past summer and saw some of the boys. Wasn't able to see many of them due to lack of time. Chick GalUgher was at that time running a store for hia Dad and, so he says, is quite a salesman. Joe Corcoran is working for the city of Brock* ton, Massachusetts, and is going back to school the second semester to get his degree.' 
" 'You were wrong about Charlie Macalnso. He is not working for his Dad, but is teaching school. I haven't seen him for a couple of months but expect to in the near future. Harry Fox Is working for his Dad, and Bob Hack* man is working, but I'm not sure what he is doing. Leo McFarlane was here over a week­end late in the summer, and, although he fin­ished before we did, I thought you might like to know. He's coach*ng and teaching at St. Mary's High School in Lansing, Michigan. 
" *l*m going down to South Bend for the Minnesota game this week-end. Tom Rini wired Sunday about it, so we'll go down to­gether. I'll see that all the boys are in by 
12. I was down at Virginia Beach this sum­mer, but didn't know Hook Kerwin and party were playing there. Result — I didn't see them. Tell them for me they weren't billed as they should have been.* 
" *I hope to see some of the boys this week­end, Hal. and if I hear anything new I'll let you know. If you see John KcUey, tell him for me I'm glad to hear he's working. I rather feared what an inactive period might do to him. , . .* 
"Thanks ever so much, Hugh, and here's hoping that there will be more letters from Canton, Ohio. 
"The old red-baiter, Rus Fitzgerald, writes in red ink, 'I have turned from political re­form to social welfare work. . , . My first po­sition was teaching in one of these "vacation schools" which seem to be a part of the (^th­olic Action program. And, steady now, Hal— one of the subjects I taught was Christian Doctrine. At the end of the summer I took a vacation to New York. Came the hurricane (and nearly went New London) blowing me into a job with the local health department as a food inspector. It was only with super­human power (for which I'm noted) that was able to supervise the destruction of con­demned cases of beer. I've become quite inter­ested in public work, and I think I'll stick 
with it. At the present time I'm trying to worm my way into the State Department of Health at Hartford, having served an appren­ticeship for a month now.* Rus rambles on in a humorous fashion and concludes by saying that Len Tobin is teaching high school up­state.

MANY SHALL COME 
Price $1.50 
By Patrick]. Carroll, C.S.C. 
•
 This is the first time Father Carroll has built a fiction upon American life enacted by Amer­ican people. He has created real men and women who use a liv­ing language and express vital things. We all have heard of the man who leaves his Faith for position and social advantage— saves the life to lose it. Father CaiToU has set this man in the person of James Rice, vividly and unforgettably within the pages of MANY SHALL COME. 

•
 Seldom do you come upon a girl of fact or fiction, so vital, so manifold in the quiet strength ^ of her character, as Helen Eice, § whose world-pursuing father en­riched her in the things of Time but dispossessed her of the things of Eternity. How she found that Faith through a chance meeting with two nuns, on whom Father Carroll has 



: f bestowed insight and charm, and ;! through a friendship that later blossomed into love and mar­^ riage, on and on to the Euchar­: f istic Congress in Dublin with its glory of light, music and color, where Helen heard the ageless Still Small Voice — all that, swiftly, subtly, insinuatingly, 
] ^ within a strong framework of S religion. Father Carroll has achieved in a remarkable degree in this his latest and unques­tionably his best book of fiction.

" 'You say that you are working for a credit company, and I wonder. What is credit?' 
"Ed Bartneft came through with two long letters, one on October 25, and the other on November 20. In his first letter Ed says, 'I've ducked the unemployment issue by enrolling at Columbia for an A.M. It's O.K., but their English department doesn't come up to N.D.'s. I*m making considerable money now, writing a hook review every week and covering foot­ball games every Saturday, but that football job is just seasonal employment. It pays nice­ly, though —' so nicely, in fact, that I'm torn between seeing the Army-Notre Dame game or covering the Columbia-Cornell game. I've been 
- pretty active since I returned from Europe (Ireland's wonderful! I plan to go there next summer with Chuck Bcasley.) Besides book reviews and football, I've written Sun Ray stories, tried to sell a couple of poems, been on the staff of the New York "Alumni News," and on the Rockne Publiicb' Committee. I've turned down chances to be editor of our par­ish paper, and teacher of creative writing at night school in New Rochelle- All of •which doesn't give me much opportunity to work at Columbia, which must he a shock to you, knowing me as Ed, THE CONSCIENTIOUS ENGLISH MAJOR. I'm gonna flunk at Co­lumbia, too,' 
" 'I have news on other '38ers. Bill Gallin tramped the streets all summer looking for a job, made a novena, and got four good engi­neering offers within a week. He took one and gave the other to Frank Kesicke. Tom Shiels, Vin Lipsio are still looking. Vtc &Ier­cado went to Middlebury College during the summer, and I don't know what he's doing now. Besides meeting Rcilly and Mullen in Europe, I ran into Dick Fitzgerald, ex. *38, of Chicago, coming back on the "Washington." George Kcrwin is working as a chemical engi­neer for the U. S. Gypsum Company in Southard, Oklahoma. Jim Sullivan worked in a Lons Island mental hospital all summer and is now looking for a teaching job in Bing­hamton. Joe Krupa, ex. '38, is taking a course at N,y.U. and looking for a job. Bob Bfnllen, the last I heard, is unemployed. Ed Hogun is still unemployed. Tom Healy has moved to God's country — Westchester.' 
"In his second letter, Ed covers the Army-Notre Dame game for the '33 notes. He says, 'It Was tough you couldn't make it the Army game week-end. It was great—-it seemed the whole '38 class was there. Friday night I went to the Reunion and Rally at the Penn­sylvania, where there were fine si>eakers and plenty of erccellent beer. Among those I re­member at our take were Chuck Beasley, Bill Gallin, Tom Shiels, Tom Atkinson. Rico Di Brienza, Osbomc, Tom Mnlligan,. John Hnrrin (last three down from Harvard law), Jerry Kane (who is stilt tutoring the son of Grace, of the Grace Lines, out on Long Island), John SAmitZt DuSy Dolan» Jim Flanagan, Hook Kerwin, Bill Brannigan, Bing Connor, Ed Uniache (who is night-clerking in a N. Y. hotel), Pat Carey {who is rooming with Uniache in Brooklyn), and some others I don't recall. The game Saturday, of course, was great.' 
" 'After it, besides those already mentioned, on the field I ran into Bill CasClenun* taking law at N.D., and John (S.A.C.) Kelley. Then the real excitement began. I went down to the HcAIpin and ihe Pennsylvania, and bumped into a whole mess of guys — guess where? George Belanger, who is in his Fa­ther's textile business, was there with his two 
brothers. Others were: George Keenan (work­ing for his Father), Joe O'Boyle, Danny Boyle, (who is in some med. school). Bill Costello, Joe Messtck (still at NJ).), Chuck Metzger (still at N.D.). and Pete McCairon (still at N.D.).It sure was swell seeing all the guys again. Bill Gallin, by the way, isn't up-state as you reprinted in the ALUMNUS; he's working in White Plains, just a few miles from New Rochelle. Tom Shiels hasn't a job yet, but he's making dough booking bands in Westchester spots. That's all for now. . . .' Ed also mentions that Maxwell Anderson is reading his poetic play, 'Beyond the Bridge.* Thanks oodles, Ed, for the mar\*elous letters. 
"A few of the '38 boys attended the Navy-Notre Dame game in Baltimore on November 
5. I saw Tiger McGrath, Ed Mattingly. John Lnngren, Bernard Wsssell ('Was' is still chew­ing tobacco and working for his Father's coal company in Mt. Carmel. Pennsylvania), and Chuck Hurley (who is going to night school and working for an adding machine company in Trenton, New Jersey). Ed Mattingly, who is still working for his Father's wholesale produce company in Cumberland, Maryland, ran into Duck Leahy, Jerry Ledvina. Johnny Braddock and Hal Langton. I also saw Joe O'Neill, the football player of a couple years back, Ennis Murphy, ex. '34, who is working for Hoschild Kohn's department store in Bal­timore, and two fellows who were freshmen with us, Dan Murphy and Vernan Kohlhauus, who are working for the Government in Wash­ington and talking law at night at George Washington University. 
"John ClilTord, the old 'Splinters' of last year, comes through w*ith this delightful letter. 
•As usual I'm late getting my copy in but (as usual) I have a legitimate excuse— . . . I'm working for the W. T. Grant Company, 75 Court Street, Binghamton, New York, and my position is all around flunkey. It is very interesting work, but thousands of angles to learn. My address is subject to change very often, so ivhere my next letter will come from 'only time will tell.' 
" 'Ed Hogan and Jim (Carroll mailman) Sul­livan have bumped into me in the store while I was making the rounds. Neither is working as yet, but Ed is looking for something in I.BJVI. here, and Sully is on the lookout for something academic — "teaching," I think they call it,' 
" 'T, P. Healy •ivrote during the summer and was moving to New York with his family. No job. Joe Callahan joined the Army — always was wild about brass buttons. Hank Leader is back at N.D. Saw Dick Mollcr a few times during the summer. He wasn't doing anything before the elections, but since then is a man-behind- the -throne in Stratford. Gene Dolan was tr>'ing for some civil sen'ice job in N.Y.C. and during the day w*as holding down the job of interpreter of Spanish in an Irish beer joint. Brother Joe is not working yet, but be is a B.S. man and they never have to any­way. Jim McCarthy is back at N.D, taking biology. I was mentioned in the ALUMNUS as back, too. I was going, but then diangcd my mind. Joe hears from Joe Timmerman and Bad Mackin once in a while, Tim is one of the many "sans labour" and Mackin is selling those peeping torn shades — Venetian Blinds for his Pop. . . .* 
'"Jim Sullivan brought the Novembe r ALUMNUS into the store today. I saw your 
S.O.S. and that explains my note. . . . You might mention in B.F, that Jim McCarthy owes me a letter. . . ,* 
"Thanks, 'Splinters,* write again soon and stay away from that 'Gas House Gang* you mention. . . . 
"And from nearby Philadelphia comes a 

bulky envelope containing^ t^vo letters, one from Jack Zertist, and the other from Jack Solon. Zerbst has the floor. *It is two o'clock in the morning and weariness has me in its Kvasp after a dreary date. Be that as it may, your article in the ALUMNUS, just read, brings such startling news that I had to write you for further information immediately. Just when am I going to South Africa ? . . . Please correct that line in the next issue. Philadelphia is a peaceful spot and 1*11 be inhaling its air for many, many months. The brotherhood of peddlers, drummers, or what have you, have taken me into their - fold as they have many of the other boys, and Tm stilt with the National Carbon Co.. 1421 North Broad Street. Philadelphia.* 
" 'Jack Solon, the "Wharton Finance Wizard. is now sharing our room with his vibratory emissions. If his snoring awakens the Jewish sorority sisters next door, this night comes to an abrupt halt. Dick Danehy, another A.B, man who found the need for Commerce so urgent as to continue his education, eats din­ner with us every evening. The conversation usually runs, "Now back at N.D. ...*' ' 
" 'After two years and no word, we ran into fire-cnicker Johnny O'Connell in the place where all men gather in a local theatre. He is an electrician for the school board. After leaving N.D., Johnny started for the Univer­sity of Texas. He got as far as Illinois where he ran across Jim English. They went out together, and were rolled for their semester funds. Broke. John returned to this locality and went to Villanova for a year before giving the pursuit of knowledge a kick in the pants. He lives only a block from us. . . .' 
" 'Ed McCabc and Jack Lungrcn keep the lights across the street way up on the third floor burning until the wee hours. They're working on a stiff that has affectionately been tagged "Pappy." Those boys \vill reek with such smells by the time they receive their M.D.'s from Penn. that anyone inclined to be a patient will shortly lose that inclination. Jay Manning and Graham Owens, of the '37 class, survi\'ed the first year, so maybe E<1 and Jack have a chance after all.' 
" 'You know that Bill Mehring was a stu­dent engineer for Corn Starch Products in Argo, Illinois. Big training for two years in every department of the plant then an excel­lent position. Dick Leahy is at "NMiarton also. He drives young females to the sidewalk with his new Packard convertible. We see him only occasionally.' 
*' 'Ted Fraser is in New Jersey at present waiting for a job with General Motors Export Department to break. He hadn't quite recov­ered from the bus ride from Los Angeles to New Jersey when I saw him at the Army game.' 
" 'That Army game week-end is a very pleasant memory. So many fellows seen and unseen, . . . My residence address is 234 South :!8th StreeL' 
"Zerbst really CJime through with one of the finest letters I've received since opening shop in the ALUMNUS. I hope, both for my own sake and the sake of the class, that there will be plenty more of them. Good luck. Jack, and sorry for having you down in South Africa. 
"Jack Solon then takes up the same pen and continues, * "South Africa" Zerbst has given you all the dope — local hlgh-Iights, color. Jewish sororities and what not. . . . Hal. I don't snore — much. I've heard Zerbst (No. 1) with a low bass with innuendos and Jack (No, 2) sporting a healthy Crosby baritone snore with emphasis on the crescendo. .. . I have one bit of news. Remember the little radio jamboree last year? Well. Phil McHagh. the guy who put it over, quit school to take a job with Columbia Broadcasting System. I saw him over the Army week-end, and he's doing fine. . . .' 
" *I hear from Jim Burgess occasionally — if he writes you that I have grown a mus­tache, disbelieve him because the thing was cut off a few dates ago. . . . Saw Dan Coch­ran at the Biltmore; he stopped by to have a cocktail with me. Said the work was plenty tough. Well, I'm not complaining: the work at ^Vha^ton isn't that hard. - . .* 
"Some week-end. Jack, when time hangs hea\T on your hands, jump in your car and drive down to the Utopia, and I'll do my best to entertain you. P.S. — Bring 'South Africa' Zerbst along. . . . 
"John Clcarj-, of Taunton. Massachusetts, probably the greatest Lothario of our class, wrote me a short letter along about the end of October. The body of the letter concerned plans for the Army game, but Jack also man­aged to mention that he is working for Tuck-away Farms, near Taunton, as a butter and egg man. and that Jimmy Malchay is teaching school at Coyle High, Taunton. Jack, in char­acteristic fashion, concludes his letter, 'I re­main as ever, deeply in love. . . .' 
"Jim Sullivan, from Binghamton, New York, is thoughtful enough to write a personal tet­ter. He includes the information that he is still unemployed and says, 'I worked in the state hospital on Long Island until the middle of September, but began to be afraid that they might lock me up. I am hoping to land a job teaching, but no luck as yet. .. . I think I'll write a book on *'How Not to Get a Job." * Jim passed along some news about the fellows, but since it has already been covered from other sources it is omitted. 
'*BU1 Wocmer, certainly one of the best writers our class turned out. pens the glad news that he is now 'employed for either Cal­vert Distilling Co., Carstiurs Distilling Co., or Joseph E. Seagram St Sons. I haven't found out yet, for I've only been -working there a week (This was written on October 24 so Bill probably knows by now.) It's a bottling plant, by this time I have found out that much. But the sign on the front of the building says "Carstaira Distilling Co.„ at the top, and after a lot of printed matter has "Calvert Distilling Co." at the bottom. But Seagram's hired me. It's one of those corporatlon3-within-cari>ora­tion-within corporations things. At X)resent I am in what is known as the "general 'Utili^ gang. . . ." ' 
" 'In passing you might like to know that John Sdiwartzd, New Albany, Indiana, is at present an insurance salesman, but I don't know who he's selling for, . , .* 
"Bill asked for the addresses of Rus Red-gate, Bob Mullen, Dick Hennessy, Bud Dark, and Larry Lariun. These were furnished, so you fellows can expect some fine letters from the Louisville Liquor Maker. 
"I'll make this a miscellaneous paragraph and clear up a few bits of stray information that have floated in by varioos means. Tiger McGrath, now of C.U. in Washington, spent the Minnesota week-end in Baltimore with zne, and we had a swell time listening to the gaxae and celebrating the victory. He's cominic for the Southern Cal week-end, and I'm looking

".And just as I was about to close this col­lection of notes, along comes two more letters. Georce Kcrwin <P.O.

"Another letter for this issue comes from that tried and true pool-shooting friend, Jafce Lechncr. Jake writes beautiful i>ersonaI, oft-the- reoird letters on both sides of legal size stationeo'. He voices a complaint: 'I've been 
pouring out information cottceming myself in 
my letters and all I get in your lousy column is one or two lines.* Good old modest Jake-He continues in the same modest tone, 'I sup­pose you have read in the South Bend papers that my Father was elected county assessor of St. Joe County. I delivered some 20 speeches during the campaign. It has certainly seemed good to have time to do other things besides delivering speeches before large, cheering audi­ences/ Jake rambles on for two or three thousands words about himself and his ability 
— business and social — and concludes with giving the information that Louis Vetfel is working for the Pennsylvania R.R. (Jake, Jou're not such a hot reporter; you neglect to say where he*s working and -what he's do­ing.), and Jack Monldcr, after working for the Cudahy Packing Company of Chicago, has returned to South Bend to work for his Father in the Moulder Automobile Sales Co.

LATER: 
"With the deadline for the December issue just a few hours away in comes three more letters. 
"Gene Vaslctt gives us additional coverage on the Army-Notrc Dame week-end with this fine bit of reporting. 'The Army game looked like Saturday night at South Bend last year. I think every boy in the Northeastern states was in the Big Town, and in my raroblings I bumped into almost all of them. . . . Friday I went up to Westchester, as you know, and met Tom Shieh, and was very surprised and pleased to find I^artr 'Hook' Kerwin with him. Hook had just come in from Cleveland where he is soliciting freight now [this contradicts the information given above about HookJ. . . . loiter that day we went down to the city to meet Tommy Atkinson, who was coming down from Boston with Red Fitzpatrick and some friends. While Hook and I were waiting for Tommy, who should come roaring off the Albany train but Bill Branigan. And I mean roaring.* 
" 'At the Penn Hotel I bumped into Jim Armstrong and had a nice chat with him; also saw Tom Barry. At the same Saturday I sa^v JcAn Kelly, down from Maine. Ed Uniadie, who is night clerk at the Washington Hotel. Bill Costello, Jerry Rothlien. Eli Abraham. Jim Farley, Pat O'Brien, Jack Doyle, mpo Di-Brienza, and 80,000 other people. After the game we saw Frank Kesicke, ,who is now with Postal Telegraph (not as a messenger boy). Firth, Tangey, Condon, "Scoop** Walsh, and others at the German American A.C. AVe went down to the Penn bar after that and talked and sang with Cliff Tallman, still doing pro­motional work for American Tobacco Com­pany, George Belanger, the Har\'ard crowd. Leo Welch. Clark Reynolds, Duck ftlay, and the rest. Pat Carey was going around intro­ducing my girl friend as my wife, so if any­one writes to you and tells you I'm married you'll know it's all a mistake. . . ." 
" *I know now as I write that I've forgotten 
many a fellow that I saw but I really couldn't 
go around with an apple in one hand and a 
pad in the other. Where could I put the 
pencil? .. . It gives roe pleasure to report 
that nearly everyone I know is working. Firth 
is down on Wall Street, Tansney starts with 
Wanamaker'a today or tomorrow, and I'm 
making enough to bay some Christmas cards.' 
(Gene must have landed that job with Schaef­
fer's) Thanks, Gene; I'm all for starting that 
club you mention. . . . 

"A letter from Tom Shiels gives further coverage on the Army week-end. He writes, T m sorry I didn't write sooner, but most of my time lately has been taken up with the initnl appearance of the now famous Noire Dame Modcrnaircs in the metropolitan area the night of the Army-Notre Dame game. I arranged the booking with the manafirement of the now famous Glen Island Casino here in New Rochclle, and so it was the good fortune of the present edition of the Modcrnaires to make their eastern debut on the same band­stand from whence such luminaries as Glen Gray, Ozzie Nelson, Tommy Dorsey, Latry Clinton, and the rest sot their start.* 
"Tom goes on to gi%'e a list of the '38 boys he ran into. Since it duplicates most of the numes mcntionci already I'm omitting it and including only those names not mentioned yet. Tom saw: John Schmitz (in from Tiilin, Ohio, looking for a job), AI Ko^-zelove, Bill Arnold. George Fitzpatrick (He's not in the gas sDi­tion busines after all — He's teaching school in Bellingham and at the same time coaching football, track, baseball, basketball, and what have you)» Joe KnhaHcb, and others he has forgotten. Tom mentions that Hook went on to the Minnesota game and saw Freddy Wil­Ii«mson, Tex LeBlanc, Shorty Norris, Dickie Thoen. and others. Tom adds that he is now working for an orchestra booking firm in Radio City, selling 'name bands.* Thanks, Tom, for the dope and the fine letter. 
"At the last minute in comes another an­swer to a post card inquiry. Piere de la Verjfne writes all the way from New Orleans that he is at Tulane Xtow School and that it is lots of fun though plenty tough. Art Dav­idson, he adds, is studying medicine at Old Miss. Art is going to Tulane next year if he docs not change his mind. He almost went to Chicago to study music. Thanks. Pierre. 
"And that's really all for the December '38 notes, except that Jack Zerbst just blew into Baltimore on business, and he and I are go­ing out toniffht to talk about the good old days at N.D.'* 
ATHLETICS 
(Continued from Page 82) 

19th annual civic testimonial dinner to the team given by the Notre Dame club of the St. Joseph Valley, December 12. We hope that Southern California and Carnegie Tech are successful on January 2 in order to add weight 
— if any be needed—to the professor's selec­tion. 
BASKETBALL 
At this writing, you know as much about Notre Dame's basketball situation as does any­one else. The Irish opened impressively by smacking dou-n Kalamazoo. 64 to 13, and Ball State. 70 to 30, in what were obviously warm-up tests. Then, before we could return for a personal squint. Coach George Keogan rushed his lads out of town and up to Madison to take a 45 to 39 licking from Wisconsin. He says that he got them on a strange court too early in the season and that he expects the lad to round into shape nicely after a few more tough games. 
Paul Nowak, Johnny Moir, and Tommy Wukovits are missing — and they're missed — from the first team. The current inexperienced group lacks steadiness and poise, but these ele­ments will come no doubt from the practiced hand of Coach Keogan. His record has been dotted with early season defeats, and great ensuing victory string!. We don't know about the winning sti^aks. but this team will win more than it loses, maybe many more. 
At this writing, Paul DuChanne, a 5-foot 11-inch senior, is playing center, which is the tip-ofl on the size of the squad. He. Eddie Riska and Ed Sadowski are fine shots — when they're hitting — and they just weren't making those easy ones against the Badgers, particulir­ly in the first half when Notre Dame had more shots than Wisconsin, but trailed, 24 to 14. and in the second half when the gap closed to a matter of two points and the Iri.sh then missed seven or eight shots in a row. Gene Klier is holding down Tommy Wukovits' old guard post, and Captain Earl Brown rejoined the team immediateb* on his return, December 
7. from Los Angeles. He played a bang-up game against the Badgers, defensively, but his passing and shooting were excusably spotty. Meanwhile, Sophomore Larry Ryan, who had filled in for Brown, is out for two weeks with weak arches. And meanwhile again, Mark Ertel and Rex Ellis are doing their best to make their 6 feet 4 inches mean something at center. 
Don't sell *em short off that Wisconsin game. The Badgers were hot and Notre Dame wasn't. Notre Dame outplayed Wisconsin everywhere except at the little iron pay-off rim, and Notre Dame has scoring potentialities and speed which are bound to get results under Brown's fearless leadership and Keoffan*s experienced hand. The remainder of the schedule follows: 
Dec. 15—Michigan at Notre Dame 
Dec 22—Northwestern at Notre Dame 
T>ec.31—Northuestem at Evanston 
Jan. 2—Cornell TJ. at Notre Dame 
Jan. 7—Butler at Notre Dame 
Jan. 14—Kentucky at Louisville Jan. 16—Western Reserve at Notre Dame 
Jan. 21—Canisius at Buffalo 
Jan. 23—John Carroll at Cleveland 
Jan. 28—Minnesota at Notre Dame Feb. 3—Illinois at Notre Dame 
Feb. 11—N. Y. U. at New York 
Feb. 13—Syracuse at Syracuse 
Feb. 18—^Marquette at Notre Dame 
Feb. 25—Marquette at Milwaukee 
Mar. 1—Butler at Indianapolis 
Mar. 7—Detroit TJ. at Detroit 
afar. 12—N. Y. U. at Notre Dame 
"B" TEAM FOOTBALL 
Notre Dame's "B " team, under the joint direction of Coaches Bill Cerney and Jake Kline won three of its four games, tying the fourth, a point which the rating systems apparently'have missed. 
The way it works is this: Cemey coaches the team all week, then goes off somewhere to scout, while Kline takes charge for the day. \Vhoever is responsible—^we leave it up to you •—here is the record: 
Notre Dame, 13; Jordan College, 12. 
Notre Dame. 6; Northwestern B, 6. 
Notre Dame, 33; Illinois B, 0. 
Notre Dame. 12; Purdue B, 6. 

CROSS-COUNTRY 
Captain Greg Rice of the cross-country and track teams presented Notre Dame with the second national title of his career—he was the 
N.C.A.A. two-mile champion of 1937—when he led the country's best harriers home in the national collegiate cross-country meet held at Eist Lansing:, Michigan. November" 21. His time for the four-mile course was 20 minutes 
12.9 seconds, breaking the course and Central Collegiate Conference marks. His fine finish placed Notre Dame second behind Indiana in the team rankings.
