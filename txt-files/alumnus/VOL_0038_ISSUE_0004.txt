Sditorial Comment 
Officers 

from your Alumni Secretary 
The hopes for Notre Dame's future 
are high. 
The plans for it are demanding, and 
fascinating. 
As I write this, I have just come from tlie funeral of Father Kemdt Healy, C.S.C, '15. Father Healy was my Shakespeare teacher. When appre­ciation of the immortal prose palled, he would on occasion startle and delight us by reading an essay or two by Stephen Leacock, thereby endearing both Shakespeare and Leacock (and tlie teacher) to tlie class. Father Healy was an embodiment of the educated man. \Ve thought then that it was the Harvard touch, because we hoped Notre Dame would do tlie same for us. Later we learned that there is an in­nate refinement, and gentleness, and love of culture, which schools welcome and cultivate, but cannot create. This is a radiation personality which, in the spiritual and intellectual fields of influ­ence, is deserving of a study more in­tense than radiation chembtry. (I am not against radiation chemistry, but more people are exposed to personal-it>'.) 
Two weeks ago we buried John Car­dinal O'Hara, C.S.C, '11, in Sacred Heart Church. Notre Dame men need to be told little about his life, though for the record a few of its highlights are in this ALUMNUS. 
About the same time, Edward "Babe" Voorde, '36, mayor of Soutli Bend, was killed in an auto accident, buried in Cedar Grove Cemetery on Notre Dame Avenue. A popular, help­ful, loyal and civic-minded man. Babe Voorde represented the strong lay liai­son that Notre Dame has enjoyed with its neighbors over the years. 
I have also noted the rich record of achievement in the obituaries in the September ALUMNUS. Space seems so inadequate, yet what space could be adequate to tell strangers, for quick example, the stories of Father Michael Mathis, Ed Crowe, Father Norman Johnson, Bob Kirby, or Dr. Ted Just. 

Here were pcrsonahties, ages, activities 
as varied as you could imagine. 
And I read, with the same pang of regret over the inadequacy of the rec­ord, the 1960 retirement list of profes­sors, lajonen whose humility and dedi­cation covered up the tremendous strength of character, and conviction of mind and soul, that it took to pursue tliese wtues. For example — 
Cecil Birder, whose Gilbert and Sul­livan enlivened Washington Hall, and enriched botli the cultural and theater traditions of Notre Dame, while his talent and devotion in the teaching fields of speech and music furthered many young men; Ronald O'Neill, who died shortly after retirement, a man of talent and accomplishment who re­turned to tlie teaching profession at Notre Dame to share these assets widi the aspiring young men in the College of Commerce, bringing with him also the background of a Notre Dame fam­ily of like talents and accomplishments, authors of pages in the history of the University diat reflect its strength; Wil­liam Roemer, whose philosophy re­flected itself in his manner, in his ac­tivity on the lay faculty, in his family life and his identity in the civic and spiritual community in which he lived; AVilliam Turner, a quiet, gentle man, whose abilities as teacher of engineer­ing drawing gave students in engineer­ing a quarter century of developing early competence in their approach to their fields; George Wack, long time (1923) teacher in the Modem Lan­guages, whose even pleasant tempera­ment carried through vicissitudes of his profession, family and economic prob­lems the constant unselfish competence of serious teaching. 
All of these people were tributaries in the mainstream that is Notre Dame. It would be a wonderful, and I think better, world, if literature were to rec­ognize that the biography of the well man, the happy man, the spiritual man, the unchanging man, is as sig­

Excerpts from a sermon by Bishop-elect Francis J. Furey, D.D., at the pontifical requiem Mass tor Cardinal O'Hara in Philadelphia: "One of St. Bernard's most famous sermons was on the Holy Name of Mary. . . . 'Following her, you will not go astray; praying to her, you will not lose hope; thinking of her, you will never make a mistake. If she is your support you will not fall; if she is your protectress, you have nothing to fear; if she is your guide, you will never grow weary; if she is on your side, you will reach your goaL' . . . How fitting that our late beloved Cardinal Archbishop should have chosen for his episcopal motto a phrase from St. Bernard's homily. . . . 
"After the evening meal, visitors to his home would be invited to go with him to his chapel to recite the Rosary of Our Lady. After the Rosary, he himself would lead his small congregation in the Litany of the Blessed Virgin, which he knew by heart and which he loved to scty. .. . 
"To follow in his footsteps we must follow Mary. 'Ipsam sequens, non devias.'"

About that RELIGIOUS BULLETIN Father founded in 1921: It came about by an accident. During the student mission, several boys lost 'rubbers or prayerbooks. The prefect of religion tapped out a notice and tacked it up on the bulletin board. He added a few light remarks, urged at­tendance at the mission, invited sinners to penance! The boys begged for regular BULLETINS. 
His instructions on chastity and his ex­hortations to prepare wisely for marriage were priceless and are still quoted. For example, "It is the great desire of God that heaven be peopled with saints who will be happy with Him eternally; yet He makes the creation of a soul dependent on the will of a man and a woman . . . God is not mocked. A terrible judgment awaits the man or woman who tries to cheat God out of His share in His partnership." 
Years later over NBC, addressing aliunni scattered across the nation, he reminded them that God must have a share in all their actions. "Business is a relationship 
— not simply between a buyer and seller, but between buyer and seller and God. Government is a relationship — not merely between ruler and citizen, but bet^veen ruler and citizen and God. . . . Take God out of this picture, and the whole scale of values is changed." 
It is no wonder that in 1939 Pope Pius XII chose Father O'Hara to be chaplain to the Catholic chaplains of the U.S. .\rmy and Navy. Father O'Hara was a priests' priest, perfectly suited to minister to chap­lains and to speak up with force when Army or Navy brass pressured for "com­mon worship" or contraception. 
It is no wonder that, after the war, as Bishop of Buffalo and Cardinal-Archbishop of Philadelphia this great priest concen­trated on building Catholic schools and strengthening Christian family life. 
I met Father O'Hara first on a hot, muggy day in mid-September, 1928. He said, "How about a swim tonight, down by the pier in St. Joe Lake at 10 o'clock?" It was a lucky meeting for me. Like many another, I owe my priesthood to the life and work of the late Cardinal.

Our Familif to the South 
The Church's interest in the Spanish-speaking third of our hemisphere, once typ­ified by the early efforts of Father John Zahm and the "good neighbor policy" of the late John Cardinal O'llara, has re­ceived a new impetus from the travels of Xotrc Dame priests among alumni and friends in Latin .America. 
Father Theodore Hcsburgh, C.S.C., ac­companied by Father Robert Pclton, C.S.C., recently visited alumni throughout the Cen­tral .American countries. Father Hcsburgh was warmly entertained on Sunday, .August 7, in ^fexico City, and went from there to Guatemala, where he was joined by Father Costa Rica held a Notre Dame reception in spite of conditions preventing a landing of the Robert Pelton.

MAN and the MOMENT 
By Rev. Thomas J. O'Donnell, C.S.C., '41 
Father Pelton pauses after Afass in San Juan, Puerto Rico, with part of the group of Notre Dame alumni, their wives and children. 
Adolfo Calero, Jr., '53, were the hosts. Messrs. Maurice Picrson, '57, and Noel Pal­lais, '49, carefully planned the \-arious events. These included visits with General and Mrs. .-Vnastasio Somoza of Nicaragua, the .American Ambassador and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Thomas ^Vhclan, as well as a special meeting with the directors of the Catholic prep schools. .\ colorful departure was arranged during which all airport traffic 
•stopped while the thirty-two Notre Dame men made the air ring with the Victory March and the Notre Dame cheers. 
The airlines announced that bad weather conditions would prevent landing in Costa Rica. This made it impossible to hold a reunion in San Jose. The reunion had been advertised in the press. 
In Panama the priests were enthusiasti­cally received. Mr. Jorge F. Boyd, '60, car­ried out local arrangements with excellent 
•success.
 Mr. and Mrs. Robert McGrath graciously served as hosts during tlie stay. Many dignitaries attended the reunion which provided a splendid opportunity to discuss Notre Dame growth. One of the alumni, Mr. Jose Cardenas, '45, has just been named Minister of Public Works. 

.\flcr the Panamanian reunion. Father Hesburgh and Father Solcta attended a meeting of University rectors in Rio. Father Pelton went to Puerto Rico. The Del Valle 

•family
 was in charge of local arrangements. Father Pelton likened them to the Kennedy family in terms of efficiency. .-\n outstand­ing group turned out for the Puerto Rican reunion. Father Pelton gave a speech on Notre Dame and its regard for Latin .*\mer­ica. He also celebrated Mass for the Notre Dame people. 


The over-all impression obtained in Puer­to Rico and other countries was of tremen­^dous possibilities of influence on the part of "• men trained in the Christian tradition. Our graduates are most impressive from that point of view. During his stay. Father Pelton visited important places on that beautiful island. Included among these were Ponce, the Catholic University of Puerto Rico, Barranquitas, -Arecibo (the new diocese of Bishop Alfred Mcndez, 
^C.S.C), etc. Significantly on the last day of the visit, the death of John Cardinal O'Hara, C.S.C., was announced. It was this dedicated man who had done so much to foster a sound relationship between Notre Dame and Latin .America. On the day of his demise, the ^news was all over the island. 
On the bust of Moliere that stands in the French Academy are the car\'ed penitential words: "Nothing is lacking to his glory: he is lacking to ours." This is a great tribute to a writer. It means he did masterful work and any lack of appreciation must be tlie fault of the readers. 
You will recall we are treating some of the privileges and obligations that come to all of us as alumni. One of these we stated as learning. From this we got into the value of Adult Educa­tion discussion groups, the Great Books. One article is not enough to develop what should be said. This means we will have to be patient. AVe will touch briefly on each point, then, at another time, we will develop the points. 
Mortimer Adier in one of his articles on Adult Education says that if he had his way he would use "schooling" to signify the development and training of the young: and "education" (with­out the word "adult" attached to it) to signify the learning done by mature men and women. He goes on to say that the brightest student in the best college under a most competent faculty after four years—even with the greatest study—is not an educated man. He says the obstacle to becoming educated is youth. This is so because the walls of an educational institution are protec­tors and tend toward an artificial life. .\s children, he says, we are spared pain. sufTering and grief. But we pay for this protection by remaining imma­ture, irresponsible and unseiious. 
\Ve are not supposed to remain chil­dren the rest of our lives. \Ve are sup­posed to grow up, to become mature, responsible and serious. It is true to say that merely leaving the protective walls and halls of a school does not give us this maturity and responsibility. Age helps; sorrow helps. Yet some people grow old but never grow up. Some people have sorrow and pain for a life­time, but never know the privilege of pain. I think it was Voltaire who said: "Ideas are like beards; men do not have them till they grow up." 
.As alumni we are away from the walls and halls. Now is the time when a due sense of value and proportion should regulate the care bestowed on every action. AVe are a busy group. This is true for the world around us. But if we are to give a due sense of value to our actions we should begin to get busy with the tilings that count. In this life it often happens that it is not what we take up but what we give up that makes us rich. And "rich" here is not meant in a financial sense. And what we take up is very often the un­necessary burdens that have a habit of dividing and growing bigger. In a word, we tend to clutter our lives with trifles. And every introduction of a speaker saj-s ". . . who, in his very busy schedule, has taken time to be with us." How nice! \Ve are rushing ahead in all directions and have forgotten the fine art of making time our ser\-ant instead of ourselves the slaves of time. 
As reasoning and intelligent alumni we ought to judge our day and our life. We ought to separate the important from the urgent, the necessary from the trivial. Only then will we begin to see that we must get back to reading and discussion. AVe must begin, as adults, to embrace the world of ideas. A Great Books group can be the solu­tion to the development of our minds and keeping tliem alive. Our school daj-s are over but our education should continue through all the years of our adult life. 
How wonderful it would be if our Alumni Clubs across the country had a permanent committee on adult educa­tion and the Great Books! The Chair­man of the committee would have to learn how to lead discussions of these books that represent a great fund of human wisdom. Then they would get the Club members to invite some of their neighbors and friends to join the group. This is the beginning. This is the job to be done. And if we take the responsibility on our shoulders we will leave no room for chips.

The number as well as the quality of law students has been declining. To illus­trate, in 1949 there were 47 law students in this countr)' for each million of the population whereas, in 1959, the number had dropped to 24 per million of the population. 
^Ve have a hca\-y burden of responsi­bility, therefore, to take all suitable steps to improve our recruitment program. To that end, in each important population center, alumni committees are being ap­pointed whose members will talk to out­standing prospective law students about the practice of law and the ad\'antages of the Notre Dame Law School. Those in­vited to ser\'e on these committees have responded enthusiastically and there is good reason to hope that the committees will be most helpful. 
.Another and very important step ^vas taken with the appointment by Rev. Chester A. Soleta, C.S.C, Vice President for .Academic .Affairs, of Professor Rich­ard M. Lyon as Pre-Law .Advisor for the College of Commerce and Professor Rob­ert L. Brannan as Pre-Law .Advisor for the College of Arts and Letters. I have no doubt that this move wll be fruitful.

nificant in our society as tlie biogia­phies of tlie sick, tlie unhappy, the material, and the unstable. All of these Notre Dame men had conflict, tragedy, love, and colorful lives, yet fundamen-t_ tally tliey had a persisting and domi­nant and intellectual stamina which gave them ultimate triumph. 
Why did my dioughts turn from high hopes and the demanding and fascinat­ing future of Notre Dame? 
Because without the high hopes of older generations, and dieir contribu-a tions and planning, Notre Dame's fu­ture would be far less fascinating, far more demanding. There should always be time for a sincere, if inadequate, "thank you."

Buffalo 
"Notre Dame Nite at the Races" at EufTalo Raceway on June 14 kicked off the summer ac­tivities schedule of the BufTalo Club. ART STA­TUTO was this year's cliiurman and did an ex­ceptionally fine job in handling arrangements which provided those in attendance wltli a de­lightful evening. Tlie highlight of the evening «-as the presentation of the Notre Dame Blanket to the Avinner of the "Notre Dame Race" by President JACK ENDERS, '53. The winner's name escapes me; — as would be expected, several tout sheets were torn up in disgust before the evening ended. 
ART STATUTO, a "transplant'* in Western New York, has been a mainstay of the club for the several years he has been here. Art is taking on a ne^v position in Pittsburgh as of September 1 — the club generally and many, if not all, of the various e\-ents' chairmen specifically, will miss i\rt*s enthusiasm and support. Pittsburgh Club — take note! 
JIM DONOHUE, M8, headed up the committee which staged the annual stag outing on June 25, held again this year at HENRY BALLING'S cotmtry estate in the rolling hills at Styhersvillc^ Prizes were ^ain awarded to winneia (?) of various events by an unnamed committee, the spokesman for which persistently refuses to reveal the identity of the memben. Club members fed they have a right to know the names of thar accusers. Jim, assisted by perfect wei^ther, gave us a most enjoyable afternoon, evening, etc. 
The Lancaster Country Club again provided the setting for the /Vnnual Golf Outing held this year on July 28 under the able chainnanship of MIKE REGAN. GEORGE FERRICK, '39, won the Mary Quinn Memorial Trophy which has been provided by MAURY QUINN in Ms mother's memory.

This being a big political year, NJ>. men on the local scene are very much In evidence on both sides of the fence. JAMES a ^VELCH, '50, is seeking the post of County Commissioner on the Demo ticket, and State Senator JOHN C. RUCK­ELSHAUS, '52, is running for re-election on the 
G.O.P. ticket. '. . . Many local alumni spent a great deal of time on the Archdiocesan Drive to build three new high schools. KARL JOHNSON, '29, was the city Associate Chairman, and CHARLES BRO^VN, '38, the architect. . . . Famous local golfers are just too numerous to mention, as are new arrivals to Notre Dame families. But we must tell of the 12th addition to the F. QUINN, M2, family. We don't feel the other proud fathers will object at all. Congratulations. . . . Weddings also seem to form an endless list. Several newlyweds are JOE DEZELAN, '58; JERRY .\!URPHY, '57; PETE MOOT2^ '60; and last but not least BILL MOONEY, '57. This last "boy" after a long wait, came thru with flying colors^ except for one detail 
—a best man—this writer—5er\-ed in that capacity, but was not what the word denotes. .. . Our club keeps growing with new men being transferred to our fair city. JOE BILL, '56, and TOM PALIG­INOFF, *57, arc newcomers. We welcome them, and miss such men as JACK BREZETTE, '54, and JOHN BRENNAN, '49, who were rcccndy trans­ferred to other sections of the country. .. . JOHN CARDINAL O'HARA is our last man In the news. We will all miss him very much. Indianapolis Is proud to have been the adopted home of this dis­tinguished religious leader, and we are sure that his family Ihing here can justly be proud of their brother. 
The club looks forward to large crmvds this fall for two big occasions. The regular Thursday luncheons should be packed during the football season. Tlie other event is the first annual "Fall Dance" at the I.A.C. October 8th, chalrmanned by BILL MOONEY, JR. and the undersigned.

Kansas City 
It's fall, football time, and the Kansas City Alumni and their guests joined other Notre Darners at the game of the year in E\-anston. A group of seventy-five spent the weekend in Chicago and took time out to cheer the Irish at Ei-anston. The real winner as always, is the William Rockhill Nelson Scliolarship fund. The group traveled under the Personal Supervision of ED AYL^VARD and RUSS FARRELL. They performed In a manner befitting Thos. Cook and Sons. DAVE CROOKS, CRAIG >\'HITAKER, and BOB .MET2LER assisted with songs, cards and good cheer. Ed and Russ, through Club President JOHN MASSMAN, announced that next year's game trip will be Oklahoma and we are accepting reservations now*. 
Tradition plays a big part m Notre Dame History. It does in Club activities also. Each year we sponsor a dinner for the incoming freshman and their dads. JERRY KEATING chalrmanned the affair and presented REV. GLEN BOARMAN, CS.C , Notre Dame's prefect of religion, as our guest speaker. WALT OTOOLE, Campus Club president, discussed his organization and its role in student activities. The dinner on September 7tli, coming right after Labor Day, failed to limit the attendance as was predicted, and the Black Angus 5er\-ed Filet MIgon to the sixteen freshmen, their Dads and thirty-five members. Best of all, the boys entered Notre Dame knowing at least 15 other freshmen.

Rome 
Our lemporao' loss is the University's gain In 
the infirmarv visit this summer of our Rome chap­
lain, FATHER ED HESTON, CS.C. Eye-witnesses 
on campus saw the only thing that can hold Father 
Heston do\vn: a cast. And yet his painful pil­
grimage to N.D. was our gain in that he repre­
sented the Rome Club in matters of import with 
the Alumni Oilice. 
More permanent losses here: BROTHER DON­
ARD STEFFES, CS.C , after eight years ot pio­
neering the now flourishing Notre Dame Intcima­tional Scliool for Boys, has been transferred to the Archbishop Hoban High School, Akron, Ohio. All N'otrc Dame and Holy Cross Romans appreciate the jobs (plural) Brother Donard accomplished in the Eternal Citv, Tlien after one year's residence we have lost MILDRED and CHARLIE ROBRECHT, '24. Esso Investors has transferred the Robrechls to Paris. Our special thanks to them for their generous participation in the club's hosting program. 
But the Lord always provides: New members are 
these medical students at the University of Rome: 
LOU NLAGGIORE, JOE DeLIA ('47. with wife 
and family), and BILL MARTIN, who, although he 
is a grad of XHlIanova '58. qualifies with two 
brothers JI.M MARTI.N". N.D.. '51. and DICK. 'G3. 
Finally, there is F.ATHER JOHN MARY WHIT­
NEY who studied at Holy Cross Seminary on 
campus and is now a bearded priest of the Oriental 
rite, based at Nazareth. Palestine, and presently on 
the stafl^ of the International Center of Pius XII for 
a Belter World near Rome. In Naples under the

into the Rome club as "Eminent" anti "Exxcllent" 
members those of the Hierarchy who received 
honorar\- degrees: Cardinal Montini, plus Cardinals 
Len:aro and Oltaviani who received degrees pre­
\-Iously; and .Ardiblshop O'Connor, rector of our 
North .American College In Rome. 
A special guest, awarded honorary membership 
was DR. TO.M DOOLEY, who gave spirited talks 
before the club with American medical students of 
the University of Rome as guests. Dr. Tom also 
moved the students of Notre Dame International 
School to an altitude of enthusiasm no other 
speaker has succeeded in doing to these testy teen­
agers. 
On the occasion of Dr. Doolcy's visit ofilcers of the club floored your reporter by presenting him w-ith an International Man ot the Year .Award which had been clandestinely arranged with the Alumni Office.

Forty mtmbcrs and guests attended the club^s 

> Universal Notre Dame night celebration at the Embers in Madison. This was our first social event of any kind since a fall outing in 1958. OR^ WILLIAM BURKE, director of the Office of Stu­dent Advisor, was our speaker and tliose in attend­ance were ver>' appreciative of his frankness and the earnestness in providing us with inCortnation, regarding not only the physical layout but of the impact of the increasing number of prospective col­lege students and how the University proposes to meet the challenge as to admbsion requirements and prospective expansion. We certainly ^vish to thank the ^Vssociation for providing Dr. Burke as our speaker. Incidentally, TO.\I HAMILTON 
» served as master of ceremonies. The results of our club's postcard balloting for officers were announced by outgoing president TOM FROST during the business portion of the meeting. They were: F. L.\WREXCE LENZ, 2502 Gregory-, Madison, president; FRtVNK HA^^­ILTON, Dodgevillc, vice-president; and BER­NARD MIXTACKI, 5400 Flamingo Road, Madi­son, secreiar>*-lreasurer. 
Twenty-four members and guests attended our summer outing and dinner at the Dodge Point Country Club. TOM HAMILTON sort of served as a one-man gang in charge of arrangements. During the business portion of the meeting, L.\RRY 
LENZ announced he was mo\-ing to Illinois and thus could not ser\*e as president for the remainder of his term. WILLIAM GORGEN, of Mineral Point, was elected president for the interim. Our business meeting mostly consisted to looking ahead to 1961, when Notre Dame comes up this way to play the University of Wisconsin. KEN NIGLIS, of Madison, »'as named chairman of a dinner ten­tatively set up for some time in October. Though our attendance was not very big, the encouraging part was the interest shown by some of those who could not be present who informed us they could not attend. 
Dr. Bernard AValdman, Professor of Physics at the University, who has been named director of the Midwestern Universities Research /\ssoctation Laboratory here in Madbon, has accepted our in­vitation to participate in the activities of our club. Also, in this area, TOM VEECH, '50, now a golf professional out of Milwaukee, came into Madison for the Capital Times open and walked a%vay with second place among the pros. In the three prior years he has come in first so he sure has become acquainted with the folding money from this area.

•THE SQUEEZE ON CATHOLIG SGHdOLS 
by John J. Kane 

N
EITHER THE PAST nor present of Catholic education has been free of problems, criticisms and concern. In 1834 ^ a Catholic girls' school in Charlestown, Massachusetts, "wa s burned to the ground by an irate mob of bigots. Ten years later, a similar fate befell a parochial school and semi­nary in Philadelphia as a result of protests over reading the Protestant version of the Bible to Catholic students in public schools. A few years ago a publication of the National Education Association, "Public Schools and the Future of America" charged that Catholic schools were divisive and un­democratic. Last year thirty lawsuits were pending in Texas over nuns teaching in public schools. But the Catholic edu­cational system has weathered tliese serious reverses and ^research here at Notre Dame has pretty much refuted the "silly charge of divisiveness. When sixty-five public school 
- superintendents throughout the nation _were asked if the existence of parochial schools caused interreli^ous tensions within their communities, eighty-eight percent said, "No." But future problems and concerns of Catholic, schools are an intra-Catholic matter and demand serious consideration. In fact, their very survival on the elementary and secondary level may be at stake. 
Today, one out of every seven students in the United States enrolled in grammar school and high school is in a # Catholic institution. Seven percent of all college and uni­v^ versity students are in Catholic schools. Growth between 1945 and 1957 has been phenomenal: Catholic elementary schools increased 80%;-secondary schools, 61%. But the past is nothing compared to what-the future will be if population predictions even approximate accuracy. Conservative esti­mates claim that college enrolhnents will double by 1973, and if the present trend for more and more students to attend colleges continues, enroUments will triple by that year. If 
^American Catholics of the future hope to educate the same proportion of their children in Catholic institutions as they do today,'some hard facts must be faced realistically: how will they pay for the buildings, libraries, laboratories, other equipment and teachers' salaries? 
The actual cost of Catholic education nationally is not readily determined but some approximation of it is feasible. 
\ 

The late Cardinal O'Hara took, the cost of educating pupils in • public" elementary-and secondary schools in various regions of the country and then multiplied this by the number in' Catholic parochial grade and high schools. He estimated that in the year 1956-57 Americans Catholics have saved tiie tr. S. taxpayer, including themselves of course, almost one and a-half biUion dollars. While this was not the actual cost' ­to Catholics, largely because of minimum salaries paid to Nuns, Brothers, priests and lay persons on these faculties, the true cost probably approached a billion dollars. This does not include colleges and\universities where relatively higher v_ tuition is paid. Such tuition usually covers only, about one-third of the instructional costs. Here the deficit is made up by ' ' gifts of alumni, friends,, business and industry, and'again costs are reduced by a teaching staff of nuns. Brothers, priests and relatively low salaries to lay faculty. Whcfi this-expense is added to that of Catholic dementary arid high schools, the total is staggering. '^ ^^ ~ ­
BUT THERE IS another problem •which American Catholics must face about their school systemsT" Increased facilities-are obviously needed. Efforts to provide them are being made but as costs spiral, there is always the danger that enforced^

cutbacks may seriously impair instruction and the separate, facilities of public and Catholic education could become grossly unequal. It would be a tragedy if the price of main-, taining a Catholic school system cost children an adequate' education. 
No matter what the cost of Catholic education is today, these expenses \viU become greater in the future. This is true for all schools but acutely true for Catholic schools on the elementary and secondary level. The major reason for this is the necessity of employing more and more lay teachers. The National Catholic Welfare Conference in its biennial survey of 1956 stated that in the last ten years lay teachers had increased by 196%. The largest increase occurred in elemen­tary schools, 409%. Actually, in the past there had been relatively few lay persons teaching in parish schools, so the percentage of increase, while startling, reflects the fact that many elementaiy schools have now added lay teachers. That . they wiU have to add more in the future is a foregone con­clusion. Vocations, generally, do not appear to be keeping pace with demand and if schools are to be staffed the only source is the laity. In 1956 there were 20,989 lay men and women teaching on the elementary and secondary level of Catholic schools. Estimating their average salary at $2700 annually, a dismally low income by today's standards, total cost was $75,000,000. By now it has well passed that mark. 
But costs of Catholic education to parents do not end with payment of tuition and contributions to the church. In some states there are book purchases or book rentals, usually both. Annual raffles, dinner, photographs and other fund-raising devices ai*e common. Extracurricular activities likewise cost money, and Kathryn Douglass found in her study, of two private schools that boys spent $69.17, girls $22.12 yearly, only part of which was earned by the students. 
Some extracurricular activities such as athletic teams and school bands also tax the resources of .Catholics and most in­stitutions have Fathers' Clubs, Mothers' Clubs or some similar organization dedicated largely to the raising of money for such equipment. While Catholic students do use the public library, some kind of school library is essential. The expense of building up and maintaining adequate facilities of this type' today is really prohibitive. Finally, in many states Catholic parents watch public school childi'en riding to and from classes in tax-supported buses for which they pay while they . 
either drive their own youngsters to school or pay for public 
transportation out of their own pockets. 
I N SUMMARY THEN, the problem is this. The Catholic birth­rate at all social-economic levels except the very lowest exceeds ' that of non-Catholics.' Catholics generally have larger ,fami-' lies, consequently more children to educate, less money with which to, do it, and the added cost of a private and/orf parochial school to maintain. They face the dismal prospect ' of an expansion of public education for which they have an obligation to pay as taxpayers and expansion of the Catholic system for which they want to pay as religious persons. Just how far and how long Catholic resources can be strained to continue the present pattern merits frank and serious con­sideration. Lutheran, Quaker and Presbyterian schools in '^ some parts of the country folded long ago for this reason. ­Can Catholic schools survive? 
Short of outright state subsidization, which is highly un-^ likely, certain changes in the Catholic school structure will *•. fast become imperative. Just what form they take may vary from one diocese to another. However, among possible changes may be a reduction of the parochial school to four years vnth the other four years taken in a public school. Or Catholics may concentrate on the high school and college level, : eliminating the grammar school entirely. These are drastic alterations and no decision should be made without thorough research. But whether this is the new look in Catholic edu­cation or not, two,steps are still essential. 
First, prayers for more vocations to the priesthood,^ Brotherhood and Sisterhood are indicated. Definite eflTorts » should be made to encourage more young men and women to enter the teaching profession. Mothers, whose children are of school age and who have had the required education, should be given refresher coui'ses to enable them to staff parochial schools and high schools. Second, even if all of these sug­gestions enjoy modest success, religious education within the Catholic home will have to be stepped up and Newman Clubs extended to public high schools. Until the wave of the future bom during the late forties and early fifties reaches an age when it can give its financial support to Catholic education, ^ there 'will be a serious lag. How serious this will be depends^ on how seriously American Catholics realize it today. 
THE POPULATION, PANIC 
by Donald N. Barrett 

T
UB CRIES OP impending calamity due to "overpopulation" are rising to an almost irrational pitch. Faith in the automatic, mathematical formula for doom, enunciated by the "pessimistic parson," Thomas Malthus, has declined considerablj', but a faith in population projections has grown apace. Gaining assurance for our faith and values from what is assumed to be science has not been unusual in America, but in the controversy over the "population explosion" science seems to be prostituted on all sides. 
In a recent issue of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Charles Darwin plays the popular game of population "scare" projections by saying that in 1000 years the present rates of increase would mean "just about standing room" for the people on the earth's land surfaces. A widely read picture^ magazine several months ago prefexTed the estimate that in 730 years human beings will be "so tightly packed" that each person's estate will be only one foot in area. But the asserted dangei's are not only quantitative, it seems, for, as Julian Huxley prophesies, "the quality of the population will with­out question go down." Presumably we can now predict the horrors of rising rates of mental deficiency, disease and other abnormalities, all due to population gro^vth. 
On the other side of the controversy we find very few liter­ate and vocal protagonists. This lack of opposition gives rise to the impx-ession that all the factual and scientific arguments 
­
' 

are on the former side. The absence of intellectual vigor on the part of large nimibers who oppose the "population ex­plosion" thesis derives in part from what Bishop Dwyer of Reno has called "the danger of orthodoxy." Too many Christians, and also Catholics, would prefer to "believe" that 
'-their position is empirically tenable, rather than give respect and support to thorough research on the problem. In illustra-" tion of this preference to believe, rather than know, we may point to the facts that there are fewer than five trained Catholic demographers in the United States and also that no 9 Catholic university or agency has sponsored or encouraged an on-going scientific study of population issues. Unfortunately today theology and philosophy tend to be unconvincing in the intellectual marketplace of contemporary problems, so non-Christian "answers" to such questions become powerful and persuasive by default of empirical research. 
• THE FEW CATHOLIC voices which are raised about the,^ population question have often reached only a limited audience * and generally have not been characterized by a high level of professional persuasiveness. In opposing certain family limi­tation methods a member of tlie staff of the National Catholic Welfare Conference was provoked into asserting the possi­bilities of interplanetary and interstellar travel to drain off 
, the world's future growing 'population. Predictably an article 
appeared soon afterward in a scientific journal exploring this possibility. Therein we get figures that are overwhelming. At all favorable estimates, for example, it would cost about 9,000 billion dollars per year to take America's present excess of births over deaths to the nearest inhabitable star. The trip, by the way, would take only 350 years at an average speed of 7,000,000 miles per hour. Probably the most vocal of Catholic writers on this issue, a theologian, has been success­^ful in reaching some Catholics. His pamphlet, having sold '•over 300,000 copies, sensitizes the reader to the moral im­plications and importance of certain aspects of population growth. Since his 1957 doctorate thesis on the population statements of Pius XII and the Japanese problem this the­ologian has ranged broadly in his writings through the statisti­cal, economic, sociological and political technicalities of the problem. It has become clear that the weakest aspects of this writing are in these professional areas where only thorough training can help one avoid the pitfalls of inaccuracy and overgeneralization. To argue, for example, that the present '••rapid population growth is only tempoi-ary due to the slowing 
of decline in death rates is both misleading and fallacious in professional analysis. 
The crucial feature of the current conti-oversy, howevtr, centers on policy decisions ^about population growth. The loudest, though not necessarily the most reasonable, policy urged upon the United States in its aid to "exploding" coun­tries is family limitation. Since half of the more than 100,000,000 babies bom this year will not have enough to eat, it is ar'gued, the clear answer is to cut this number to more i-easonable levels. India, for example, with a population in­
••crease of approximately 8,000,000 per year needs over two billion dollars of new capital annually to keep its living stan­dard at its present somewhat low level. In a nation which is described as "resource poor" in certain minerals (iron, coal) and which has 75-80% illiteracy and a high proportion of un­skilled workei's, the prospects for economic improvement are dim indeed. The success of such "scientific" arguments for family limitation can be seen in the extensive birth control program now in operation in India, and especially in the policy of two of its states of paying 40 rupees to men who voluntarily submit to sterilization if they have had three children and lack 
'^raeans to suppox-t more. Closer to home we find that the same group of American population experts have persuaded the public health clinics in Puerto Eico, a predominantly Catholic land, to urge both contraception and sterilization. Where the culture is basically Catholic and yet literacy and training in the rules of the Church have not been vigorously implemented in the past, the arguments of such health advisers becomes persuasive, as attested by the statistic that over 19% of the women in Puerto Rico have been voluntarily sterilized. The great need is evident for Catholics to engage intelligently in policy-influencing argument about the whole of Latin Amer­
'0ica, the fastest groOTng area of the world. Despite the fact that a conti-aceptive program has never proven effective in an underdeveloped country, this is still being vigorously pushed. Such a program requires a certain literacy, technical intel­ligence and sympathy which are more often lacking in these countries, as the current ineffectiveness of the expensive pro­gram in India proves. Curi'cnt opposition to America's direct contraceptive aid for such countries may be morally valid, but our current aid for other purposes permits these countries to

reallocate millions in their own money to birth controL Japan in an intensive population control program has effected a fifty per cent decline in its birth rate in about ten'years. This, accomplishment, unique in modem times, has largely been accomplished by abortions, permitted for almost any. economic or social reason. By a curious but indicative use of terms an American demographer'caUs this "nothing short of miracu­lous," about 1,400,000 abortions per year. 
CONSTRUCTIVE OPPOSITION to endorsement of such policies must be based on rational argument. This, in turn, must be backed by such a depth of professional understanding that there is a compulsion for all to engage in. the dialogue. As stated above, theological' argument seems to be ineffective in America except as an appeal to the power of the vote by different religious groups. This, however, does not constitute, a rational dialogue, for the simple taking of positions on an issue does not fulfiU the democratic principle of intelligent. citizen participation. We need to be able to understand all important sides, rather than first take a position, then attempt to rationalize it and anathematize the opposition. 
Two broad levels of questions can be distinguished on the population explosion thesis. The first is fundamental and asks: what are the facts and scientific reasoning on popula­tion growth? It cannot be the pretense of this short essay to attempt a detailed answer to this question, but certain prin­ciples may be briefly proposed. Immediately it becomes clear that protagonists on both sides of the policy question have emphasized selected, supporting data and scientific studies and minimized embarrassing or contrary evidence. The favorite persuasion of pseudo-scientists is to project population trends 250, 500, or 1000 years into the future and thus obtain astro­nomical numbers, numbing numbers, to which the paralyzed mind presumably has no counter-argument Yet it is a truism in all science that the more distant in time the event predicted, the less reliable the prediction. No responsible scientist would hazard any credence to projections beyond 50 or 100 years and even these have to be so guarded by stated assumptions that" the 100 year projection becomes almost meaningless. Extremists in the controversy seldom suggest that it is necessary to project in a parallel way the figures on production, food consumption, etc., in order to give the popula­tion projections some real meaning. Yet man must plan for the future and for this he needs projections,'or like the one­talent-man in the scriptural parable, life will catch up with him in an uncomfortable way. We cannot bury the population problem in a plethora of daydreams or by wishing it away, , or by simply asserting that "God will provide." Many thou­sands, for example, are starving to death each day of the year in southeast Asia. They demand a solution and the golden webs of hope spun by communism are beginning to look better to them. Africa, both north and south of the Sahara, with so few in the labor force, is beginning to experience the pres­sure of population upon the means of subsistence. Latin America has more than doubled its population in the last thirty years and due to high fertility and lowering mortality will.probably double again in about 25 years, thus far out­stripping the countries north of the Rio Grande. In modem times this situation is unique and compelling of intellectual analysis. It ntay seem pure journalese to call this an "ex­plosion," but there is little doubt that there has been a "sudden production of great pressure," an accepted definition of the term, explosion. The challenging feature of this deadly game of population numbers lies in the principle that total numbers in themselves are meaningless unless cori'elated with economic, political, sociological and biological data. Here is the rub. Scientists have not been able to agree on a formula which would include all these variables in defining over- or optimum population. There is agreement that the world is not over­populated, but some nations are considered to be in this con­dition. Curiously, perhaps, we can say that none of these nations need to remain in this condition, no matter what measures thereof are taken. Using refined index numbers, the United Nations reports that world production of primary, commodities (food, etc.) since 1938 has risen 32% (production of manufactured goods 69%), whereas popiilation has risen only 24%. World exports of food, fuels and manufactured', goods have also risen more than population. In the period 
1948-56 per capita product rose in India by 13%, in Japan by 55%, in Puerto Kico by.32%, in the United States by 22%. IJaiin America, Asia's eastern mainland and potentially Africa are the real sore spots. Nonetheless the conclusion appears clearly that the problem is basically one of distribu­tion. How can two-thirds of the people of the world go from a status of poverty to reasonable levels without revolution and war. Other anomalies appear too, such as the current allega­tion that Puerto Eico is overpopiilated.-despite its slow popula­tion growth rate (0.8 in 1953-57 period), rising employment levels, hours worked, etc. Israel, however, is seldom con­sidered in the same category, despite its high growth rate in' population and its serious economic problems. Finally the "scare" writers emphasize the depletion of agricultural and mineral resources as a major present and future problem. 
Harrison Brown in The Challenge of Man's Future and many 
other scientists are by no means so pessimistic. The rising cost of iron and coal deposit exploitation creates pressure on' man's ingenuity to develop such riches as aluminum, one of the world's most plentiful metals, and radio-active and solar power sources. It seems that if in the period 1850-1950 energy sources could change from 78.8% animal to 94% mineral fuels and water power, a similar change or an even faster one can occur in the next century. Thus many are more optimistic about man's creative potential in exploiting the riches of the earth than the pessimists would lead us to believe. 
TE E SECOND IEVEL of questions on the population explosion thesis may be summarized in the question: what policy best meets the problem? Two prihciples immediately suggests themselves: 1) since the problem is not completely defined scientifically or otherwise,, a policy program cannot be de­veloped with the certain conclusions and effects of a mathe­matical formula; 2) whatever program is decided upon, it must integrate the complexities of competing demands for at­tention. In much of the writing today it seems that simple solutions can be found in such policies as birth control or no birth control, in greater or less immigration or emigration, in more or less Mutual Security loans, in the growth of demo­cratic governments. Such simple faiths need to be discouraged, in favor of what President Eisenhower has called a many-pronged integrated approach. One of the most powerful^ argmn^ts by Catholics has been adduced by the recent state­ment of the American bishops on "population explosion", namely that contraception is based on a negative principle which is in direct opposition to the positive values of con­ception hdd by over two-thirds of the world. If contraception were the simple answer, then France should be the most ' economically'and socially stable nation in the world. Actually France has regretted its negative policies under the Napoleonic-, codes. We have already emphasized the problem today as one" of distribution among the nationalistic, face-saving countries; Further, it could have been foreseen that Belgium and Holland may have been conscious of the need for family limitation with their dense populations, but both found that a growing popula­tion is manageable when men concentrate on expanded trade and production, food development, etc This faith and optimism in the cooperativeness and ingenuity-industry among men characterizes the greatest difference between the two sides of the population controversy. The scientific evidence is not compelling, despite its quantity favoring population restrictionC and paucity favoring other solutions. Most population analysts, it must be emphasized, wish intelligent discussion of the' issues (see "An Inquiry concerning Some Ethical Prin­ciples Relating to Human Heproduction" by Lorimer, Bour­geois-Pichat and Kirk in Social Compass, vol. 4, numbers 5-6). No counter-charges against their "guess-tamates" will resolve the issue. 
At the present juncture of arguments concerning the con­traceptive "pill", the sending of birth control aid to other nations and the cross-fire of charges and statistics, the con-gr structive reaction can be found in the development of respect-* able research, such as the work of Zeegers in the International Catholic Institute for Social Ecclesiastical Research in Geneva and the work of deLeStapis in his recent La limitation des naissance. Importing specialists such as these will not gen­erally aid the Non-Malthusian forces in America, for the simple reason that the professional environment of the con­troversy here is quite different and alienating to most Euro­peans. We have the universities, some scientists and many resources among Catholics in America to engage in intelligent argument, but when are we to do, it? 0

spring Went unheralded in this column only be­
cause of the rush of other evcnu. Judge Peak 
had been a South Bend institution since the early 
thirties when he first scr\'ed on the bench. Long 
before that he had been a pillar of the Class. To 
his family go the sympathy and prayers of class­
mates who will miss his presence at the Golden 
Jubilee in 1962.

At the 'Ijtli reunion the Class w^s not aware 
that JA.MES .M. WARE had passed away the pre­
vlotis August, as close at Kewanna, Ind. It's sad 
to lose touch like tliat, and we hope It won't hap­
pen again. An .-MumnI Mass was said as soon as 
we learned of t!ic death, for which classmates will 
wish to add their prayers.

From the .-Uumni OiHce: 
From the rosters sent out over the summer it is apparent that there arc sixty or seventy gents still in circulation who could make the 45th Reunion the biggest ever. It's also apparent that the Class of '16 is one of the most far-ilung of all Notre Dame groups. If you have time to help organize attendance from your part of the comjtry please write to GROVER MILLER at the address above and tell him whom you're going to brin^ next June 9.

Since Christmas, live of our classmates—^AARON HUGUENARD, JACK HIGGINS, JERRY DIXOX, CHET WYNNE and DOCTOR HENRY ATKIN­SON—^havc been hospitalized for surgery. Tliank the Lord, all came through with fl^nng colors, and arc presently back on their respective jobs and are performing admirably. In early August, JERRY BARRETT of Omaha was rushed to the hospital with a broken leg suffered in a fall in his linng room. He returned to his home two weeks later with a cast to carr>' around for a few more weeks. 
On July 31, FATHER GEORGE FISCHER, C.S.C., left New York via Air France with the Holy Cross Fathers' Pilgrimage to visit the shrines of Europe and to attend the Eucliaristic Congress in Municli in early August. Father George prom­ised to remember his classmates—deceased and Jiving—at all of his shrine visits. 
In June, DR. DANIEL SEXTON was attend­ing meetings of the American Medical Associa­tion in Afiami, and in August, he and his family left their Clayton, Missouri home for a motor trip and visit to Colorado. The JERRY DKONS of £\'anston, Illinois, were on a. \:acation motor trip in late July to visit Montreal, Qud^ec, and the shrine of Si. Anne on her July 2S Feast Day. 
Frcriously wc mentioned the death of the father of FRED DRESSEL, (William Dressel, age 82 on ^larcli 27} and later learned that Fred's mother died on Christmas Day last.

JOHN B. HENAUGHAN, Ph.B. For. Com., died at DcKalb, III., his home town, about July 1, according to belated \vord received from GEORGE A. PATTERSON, a classmate, this summer. Pat and Mrs. Pat were \^iting friend:^^ in DcKalb and in that manner learned of John's decease. Pat reported that John left a \vidow but had no children. 
Your secretarial sleuth slipped up on the big angle in the death of J/\MES J. METCALFE, pre^-iously reported. The Alumni Office is author­ity for the fact that J.J.M. was a seminarian for a short time back in our school da>3 and later as a newspaperman became famous for his **Poenj Portraits" syndicated nationally in neu-spapcrs and published in several books. Frankly, I missed the connection, Metcalfes being legion, sorta. ^. 
.MRS. GEORGE UHLMEYER died suddenly Julvf. 10 of a cerebral hemorrhage, according to word from George in Rock Island, III. She had been in good health, had accompanied her husband at the graduation of tlieir son Dick, at N.D. in June, and had attended a picnic the day before her death. A married daughter, Jacqueline, also sur­\-ives. 
Globe-trotters of the Class of *23 this past spring and summer, include Mr. and Mrs. JOHN C. COCHRANE, >rr. and ifrs. JOHN CHAPL.\, .\fr. and Mrs. LAWRENCE STRABLE, Mr. and Mrs. \VALTER F. RAUBER and possibly others, although these are all of the European travelers-, from whom I have heard. ij. 
The long loose ends of stray contacts between Classmates were gathered a little tighter in recent months through letters from or about DR. GER­ALD WILLIAMS BARRY, M,D., ot Kansas City, .\fo., E. B. "WHITEY" UNVERFERTH, Ottawa, Ohio attorney, and PLIN J. SWANSON, Brent­wood, California, with \vhom GEORGE PATTER­SON reneivcd mail contact through a mutual friend of his and Pete's. 
This office, through the cooperation of class­mates, has secured N.D. Student Directories for the ycai-5 1919-1920 and 1922-1923. If I could now separate someone from their directories foi^ the yean 1920-1921 and 1921-1922, my \-aIuabIe^ arcliives would be complete. Mrs. Marie Gould, widow of EDDIE GOULD, has filled me in with certain issues o{ the DONfE, so that the '23 archives include the DOMES for 1920-1921-1922-1923-1924. In fact I Iiave two copies of the 1921 issue, which I will trade for a copy of our own 1923 issue. Mrs. Gould's '23 copy went with her good wishes to WHITEY UNVERFERTH, who was looking for one.

It is August as I write this, but the election will be decided and some will say, "Maybe it won't be so bad having a Catholic for President after all" by the time you read this. I might as well wish all you '25crs a Very MERRY CHRIST­MAS. You iiavcn't read the news I sent in be­fore the reunion. It is just one of those things the Alumni OfHcc cannot help. ^ ^ 
Just by coincidence on this Augiist 24th I picked^ up a Chillicothe paper while %t'aiting to sec one of my furniture dealers. (Your "Sec" covers the state of Ohio in case you didn't know.) This u-as on the front page .. . "Hunsinser N.D. *^fule* Dead." The article went on tt> say that ED HUNSINGER died at 5:30 P.M. on August 23rd in Philadelpliia General Hospital after sev­eral hours illness. After playing end on tha ^ great team of '24> Ed was assistant coach at Fordham and he also coadied at Vlllanova with Harry Stuhldrchcr and later at Niagara. During ^Vo^ld ^Va^ II he ser\'ed in the Navy. In late years he ^^'as an engineer for a Philadelphia con­tracting Brm. Ed never married. 
I miglit say tins was the first news I Iiavc had on Ed for 25 years as I don't believe he made any of our reunions. 
I stayed over night in ChilHcothe and called 

{Jbn his brother and sister. They had rccciwd a phone call during the night that £d*s death was sudden but he had the grace of tlie Last Rites of the Church. Our class is having the usual High Mass said and please add ED HUNSIXGER to your list of classmates who have died and pray for him and them . . . oftenl I called Ht\RRY STUHLDREHER in Pittsburgh and he asked mc to tell his sister that he would be at the funeral. I made some calls in Colmnbus so I am sure that Ji'otre Dome was represented at his funeral. Word also came tliat JOHN G. FLEMING died in July. 
, Tliis was a letter from the Alumnt office but there 
(Avere no details. Just a letter addressed to Mrs. John Fleming, Sr., 3525 Turtle Creek Boulevard, Dallas, Texas. I would like to express my sym­pathy to Mrs. Fleming and her family and that of the class in the loss of her husband. 
There may be another tissue copy from the Alumni office awaiting mc when I get in so I may have to add another so keep those MASS cron­tributions coming to H/\NK >\'UR2ER, Treas., Blackhau-k Hotels Inc., Davenport, Iowa, 
Our reunion in June \s-as a huge success. JAMES ELLIOT ARMSTRONG went all out as usual and our 35th was the best ever. Wc had a third 
-^ f our class back and one of the nicest things 
A happened at this reunion. I would say /ANOTHER FIRST FOR '25. HOWARD SPENCER'S mother "gave" a lovely luncheon for the entire class in memory of Howard. It was held Saturday noon in tlic I.ay Faculty dining room. The entire class signed a *'thank you" note which was sent on to Mrs. Spencer. It's things like Harr>''s trip from Pittsburgh to Chillicothe and tliis luncheon that makes for "togetherness" of the class of *25. 
I am sure there will be a list of the fellows who attended and I won't repeat the names again but it was wonderful talking to all our classmates again with plenty of *'buU sessions" w-ell into the 
/•jhn'ght. Even after the afTair I heard from so 
^ "many fellows .. . to mention a fe^v: JOHN BARTLEV, CHARLIE MOUCH, AL PORTA, FR/VNK McFADDEN and PAUL ROMWEBER sent a dandy picture of the two of us taken just before our class picture. The way those class pictures were ordered I am sure you all have a copy. Ntany thanks for your letters and you will get a note from mc one of these days. 
Tlie boys came from all over the nation . . . JOE TOOLEX and STEVE CARBOY from Flor­ida, JUDGE JOHN KILKENNY came from the far West as well as FATHER JOHN LYNCH, C.S.C., from California .. . some more "togcth­
/]|emcss" on the part of GIL SCHAEFFER and 
•'JOH N TRAYNOR made that trip possible. WAL­TER CYR, FR.\NK ifcFADDEN, JOHN TR.\Y­NOR, JUDGE Lr\RRY aVSEY, and JOHN* BART­LEY represented the East. AL PORTA, BILL VOOR, CL.\REXCE HARDLVG, JOHN DROEGE and GEORGE ROHRBACK came all the way from South Bend too . . . and that is a feat it seems. 
JUST IN C/\SE YOU MISSED THIS RE­UNION . . . don't wait for our 40lh . . . let's make the football cocktail parties each year. Tlic next one Is Michigan State of October I5th. Don't say you didn't know . . . because it has been 
iT^mentioned before. 
Two more classmates whom I thought I men­tioned In my last column have died. BIOX R. VOGEL of 6719 Vista St San Gabriel, California, died ifarch 26 and FIRMAN D. FUSZ, ME '25, died May 14th. Firm had been in touch with Frank McFadden and he had planned to be at the reunion but Our Lord had other plans . . . who knows maybe all those boys got together with Our Lady and really had a reunion . . . let's keep praying for the bo>-s so there Is no delay 
^^i n that "last reunion." 
^ ^ From noiv on I ^vlll try to introduce a fc^v letters in answer to the questionnaires. Here's one from JAMES W. WRAPE: "I had planned to come to reunion and. In fact, had been look­ing forward to it for about three months. How­ever, about 30 days ago, my godson, who is the son of my law partner, adriscd me that he was getting married on June Ulli, and tliat I was a 
y i necessary adjunct to the wedding. I know that 
At the Class of '15 reunion {I. to r.). President Bob Roach, Henry Snyder, Ed Riley and HaroM Mungcr were joined by perennial reuniouist Bill Grady, '17. 
this reunion Is going to be the greatest c\'cr, despite the fact that so many of our friends are no longer w*ith us, as Is Indicated by the Me­morial Card. Evcr>* good wish for a wonderful reunion.'* Sorry you couldn't make it "Dubbj*" . . . try to make a game reunion. BROTHER HYACLVTH, CS.C , Brothers of the Holy Cross, St. Joseph Retreat House, Valatle, New York, ^vrites that he is Director of Vocations for the Eastern Province and personnel procurement and Director of retreats for high school bo>-s and ^veek end retreats. "My family is getting larger evcr\' year—about 40 new members for the Congrega­tion each year. Wc have a new Novitiate here In Valaiic, for the Eastern Province, and the Superiors arc very eager to keep it filled." "We have opened four new schools in the Eastern Prorince In recent years: two large high schools for boys, a home for retarded boys in the Arch­diocese of New York, an English language high school (boarding) in Rome, Italy, and a teachers' college in Butiti, Uganda, Africa. This has caused quite a drain on our always-limited personnel, but giving mc added incentive for effort." 
Thanks Brother for that note and you can be sure your class ts proud of tite work you are doing. I saw a fine example of that splendid scliool In Rome In Fcbruarx*. With such grand fellows as the headmaster Brother Loyola, and VINCENT >tcj\LOOX oE the class of '34 (who is the one man N.D. club of Rome), as an ex­ample of the teaclicrs in that school .. . It is bound to be tops. R^VY DURST, '26; CHRIS COCHRiVNE (who rates number two as a host to all Notre Damcrs visiting Rome along with his cliarming wife) and myself, did our darndcst to make Vincc MoMoon "THE L\TER.VATIO.\AL NOTRE D.\ME ^[.\N OF THE YExVR." He really deserves the title. Well boys my carbon is wearing out and besides I have gone beyond the limit of words for a column so you will have lo wait 'till later for more nc»vs about your class­mates.

REUNION RIME Twenty-sixers, three cheers for those gay 
ca\'a]iers Wc haven't laid eyes on for 33 years! May we meet every one ere the set of the 
sun On June 9-10-U in Sweet Si.xty-One! 
We hope that by the time this Issue of the ALUMNUS reaches you, we will have formulated some plans for our 35th reunion which will be held on June 9, 10, 11, 1961. JOHN RY.AN, our Class President, is now setting up some commit­tees to handle the details. We would like to have your opinions as to your likes and dislikes Kcper­ienced in our previous reunions and suggestions for new things to tr>*. 
We have recently heard that James Stack, son of our DR. J.AMES E. STACK, has been elected captain of the 1961 track team at Yale. I'm sure that our whole Class will feel proud and con­gratulate both you and your son on this fine honor. 
Now retired from the U. S. Navy is CAFT. FRANCIS J. BOX. He now lists his occupation as Attomo' at Law-Business Counsel and his busi­ness address as Cheyenne, Wyoming, and Wash­ington, D.C. The former was his home city while he was at Notre Dame. Hb secondary business is cattle and real estate. Captain Bon expects to attend our 35th reunion. 
In June JOHN RY/\N and I were going to luncli and bumped into R:\Y DURST, our past president on Micliigan Avenue in Chicago. Ray was hurr>'ing to a Notre Dame Foundation meet­ing. He is chairman of this organization In Chicago. 
We tvere saddened to hear of the deaths of VINCENT D. (REX) O'MALLEY and \TNCENT 
L. GOULET, our Class Treasurer. Both have been enrolled In the Holy Cross Mission Furga­torial Society. John Ryan has asked mc to fill out VTnce's unexpired term. 
No doubt you have now received the fly-leaf on the 1961 reunion classes and our Class roster which was sent out by the .-Mumni Office In August. Wc noted some omissions and errors In the roster. ^Vc will send you the corrections In one of our mailings. 
From the Alumni Office: 
BOB C:VREY, man:^ng director of Chicago­land's Hawthorne racetrack and father of famed quarterback TOM CAREY, '57, was profiled re­cently by DA\'E CONDON, '45, in the Chica^ Trib's "Wake of the News" columti, as an Irish football fanatic—when the track season closes. 
Ellen Dooley, daughter of the late beloved BILL DOOLE Y and his talented wldo^v Kate, was mar­ried Sept. 4 to Franklin Cowpcrthwaite of Kents Hill, Afe. 
HAROLD KLEIN was promoted to senior vice-president of the lowa-Des Moines National Bank, baWng been a v-p. since 1943. He's also a wee-president and director of Northwest Equity Corp., state chairman of the legislative council, American Bankers Assn., and a former Chamber of Com­merce president.

Except for tl»c political conventions, the ferment 
in Cuba, the Congo and the Powers spy trial, 
this has been a quiet summer. One week was 
spent keeping in view a good deal of tlie time on 
telcnsion, the Chairtnan of liic Democratic Xa­
tional Committee- PAUL BUTLER, who retired 
after the convention. I am sure we all regret his 
departure. He certainly did scr\c as a link to 
politics on ilic Xational scale. 
JACK DAILEY has spent the last two months touring Europe with liis wife and son ^vho has just been discharged from Army scr\-icc, I sup­pose many other classmates have also gone to Europe at one lime or another, but what makes this particular trip so novswortliy is the way Jack describes it. It has been my good fortune to read several letters sent to members of hjs family. He puts them out at regular intervals and has his law firm circulate them to \'arious mem­bers of Iiis family, somewhat like a news bulletin. Tlicse Icltcrs arc remarkable for their detail. lie not only recommends wliicli hotel to stay at in any particular city, but recommends a particular nwni of the hotel from which to get the best vic^v. 
I ran into TONf DUXX the other day. He is now joining the roster of classmates to have a son at Xotre Dame. ,f\rthur will enter in Septem­ber of this year. 
AVlien my own son returned from his freshman year in June, he brought a I9G0 Dome with him. It lias now taken its place with the Domes whicli %verc published when we were at school. The last one I have is 1927. Tliere now seems to be a strange gap between that year and 1960. What­ever happened to the Domes of 1937, 1947 and 1957. and all the others? Somehow ilie current Dome seems to fit naturally next to those of mote ancient date. When I compare the Annuals of the two periods, the truth Is again borne out, that the characletistics of a scliool, or I suppose of the world, do not cliangc, the faces only are different. 
Our ranks have been thinned again since the last issue of the Alumnus. 1 received word re­centlv of the deaths of SA.M KEHOE, BSEE, and GLEX.V L. SMITH, BCS. Please remember them in your prayers. 
Xcws of the 19G0 Class Reunion naturally direct our thoughts to our own Reunion, which will come, not In I9G1, but tlie year after tliat. It is not too early to think about attending this one, which will be our 35th. Pcrliaps I do not need to say that as the years go by, each Reunion becomes more important than the one preceding it, so you had better begin to lay your plans.

If we had a survey similar to the Religious Survey of FATHER 0*HARA with an invitation to comment on our recently deceased friend and beloved Cardinal, it would yield a flood of com­ments from the '29ers similar to those we have recently overheard: 
"He was the campus personality about whom there was no disagreement, the *pope* was tops." 
*'.\s a freshman, I met Father O'Hara in mid-September as did perhaps 600 others. I \Tsited with him for about five minutes. A week later we met in Sorin Hall corridor. He called mc by 
^am e and asked mc how things were back in ilillsboro (my home town)." 
"He had the rare gift of finding time to visit with you, to make you feel that your whims had priority over the profusion of urgent correspon­dence on his desk." 
'*Just a few months ago in a note to Cardinal O'Hara, I mentioned the date of my mother's 86th birtliday and her place of residence in Missouri. A letter from him was the highlight of her birth­day." 
**We often worked late in the basement of Science Hall. It \\*as a usual occurrence to have 
^rh e then President O'Hara stop by. His devo­
tion to Our Lady's University' w-as matched by his interest in her sons." 
"Those days, shared with Father O'Hara at the lake and ^vith Rockne at Carticr Field and with botli of ihem (and the rest) on the dnder paths of the campus . . . were the greatest.'* 
It's a small world, — last spring FATHER LOUIS THORNTON received a wire from Con­vmr Astronautics, San Diego, stating that they had a summer position open in the Trajcctor>" Measurements and Radiation Central Group. Your 
^|ccrctary applied tor and accepted the position. 
^iVith wife Margaret and son Larry, age 16, now a junior at St. Joseph's High Scliool, he drove to California for the simimcr. 
Barely inside the entrance at Astro is DICK DONOGHUE, '30, in the purchasing department. Dick, the daddy of three fine sons, docs consider­able traveling in expediting parts for the Atlas. 
Also at Convair is EMMET McG\BE, former iresidcnf of the S.A.C. and a co-administer of the 
Cf" 
grid graph and related projects. Others with Emmett were TOMMY RYAN, BILL KRIEG, and MANTsTf VE21E. Emmett lived off-campus and, besides his extra-curricular actiWties, found time to work at Smith's Cafeteria and to do some paper correcting. He recalls his accounting classes u-Ith BROTHER "CYP,** particularly his seat mate of those ttvo years, SID SIDENFADEN. He stitl has many interests, one of which is work­ing with Father Tliomton in the placement of recent graduates. LARRY MOORE stopped by for a visit some months ago. Emmett and Mrs. McCabe have a daughter, Kathleen, 3, and a son, Patrick Emmett, age one. 
While in San Diego, your secretary had the pleasure of a visit with JOHN SULLIVAN, '48, and Mrs. SuUiran and with JERRY BILL, '29. and wife ifary. Tlie Bill's have three sons and a daughter. Tony will be a junior and John a freshman at Notre Dame this fall. Robert, age 14, will inherit the sailing chores of his older brothers and ^s•^ll qualify eminently, partly be­cause of shipping to Peru, South America this summer. 
JACK McCL.\REN is another active '29er in San Diego. Jle represents Lc Toumeau ^Vcsting­house. The McClarciB have two grandchildren, Julie and Charley, clilldren of daughter Kay (North). Their son, Thomas is 20, and daughter Melissa and ^fartha are 8 and 6 respectively. Jack is recovering from an acute siege of pneu­monia. He recalls a pleasant visit with Father O'Hara and others on the campus back in '33 while visiting at Notre Dame on his hone>-moon. He had maintained a correspondence with the Cardinal. 
Plans for a get-logether of '29ers and their friends arc being formalized at this writing-A site convenient to the stadium after the Michigan State game is mucli in demand, but we will probably have gathered in the Science Bldg, 
MICHAEL J. O'KEEFE'S new address is West­wood Supper Club, State Road 2, St. Mary's Ohio. Wc couldn't imagine one with more prom­ise to a hvmgry classmate, 
JOHN GILTINON'S new Chicago address is 601 West Divcrsey Parkway, while DON PERRY -VLEXfVNDER now receives his mail at 14 East Espanola, Colorado Springs, Colorado. 
THOMAS McNTCHOLAS now resides at 2319 Cherry \\'ood Lane, Orlando, Florida.

At this writing the Michigan gubernatorial cam­paign is andent history, hut defeated Democratic candidate EDWARD D. CONNOR has campaigned long and hard, according to a profile in the Detroit Free Press which said in part: "The ruddy, ener­getic man has a slight accent when he expounds on the problems of our state government. It's an accent he picked up as a barefoot, raggy-pants Irish kid in Gary, Ind., where he played ^-ith. the ofT^ring of tough, plain-speaking stcelworkers. . . . Council­man Connor has 25 years experience in government. , . . He's up at 5 a-m. e\-ery morning to greet workers entering plants. .. . Coimor's voice Is beginning to crack from his 20-hour-a-day cam­paigning. But he loves to campaign. He loves it because he has a great sense of humor. .. . He's one of the fastest readers around .. . he can read an average-sized book in 50 minutes . , . and he has a photographic mind. Once he's seen something whether it's loaded with complicated figures or not, he feldom forgets it. This trait has his campaign helpers half craz^-. They think he's not interested in what they have prepared. But the fact is that u-iih one glance he has it ^vell in mind." Son MIKE CON'NOR, '60, made up to 10 speeches a day for his father, while Ed, Jr., and daughter Patrida put in long hours at hciidquarters.

REUNION RIME What '31 seers can predict without fears There'll be chances to gather for 30 more 
years? If you haven't begun to make plans, get it 
done For June 9-10-11 in Sweet Sixty-One! 
As I sit myself down to t>-pe a few notes to the men of 1931 it dau-ns on mc that this time next year we will have had our THIRTY YEAR. REUNION behind us. Little did we think that the beautiful campus we kne\** in 1927 ^rauld be the magnificent one it is today. For those of you who have not returned to a reunion or to other campus events, next June will be an excellent opportunity and perhaps the last time many of us can get togetlicr for a iveekend. 
I was out of town when our local dub golf outing w:xs held at Elmhurst Country Club and upon my return learned that a icve of my trusty scouts missed it also so I am unable to report on those present this year. The Alderman NICK BOHLING golf day ^vas held August 3Ist at Ctcneaglcs C. C. I am sure Nick had a scattering of N.D. men among the hundreds who attend his affair every year. It was quite a surprise the morning of June l6th watdiing the Dave Garro­\ray program "TODA\'" to sec DR. ROBERT I^ JACKSON, '30, in a conference tdecast in con­nection with the I09th A-M.A. meeting hdd Jn Miami, Fla. I saw GIL SEAMAN and RAY COLLINS in July upon the occasion of the wed­ding of Ray's daughter Patrida. JERRY DES­MOND'S wife was present but Jerry was unable to get away that weekend. I saw FRANK HOL­L.4ND and RED O'CONNELL recently and can report that both are doing very wdl for themselves. JOE KIRBY returned from Wichita, Kansas and is now at 315 James Avenue, Rockford, Illinois, 
Notre Dame Alumnus^ November, I960 
which is not fax from his old home town of 
Wauitcgan. JACK SCHMriT has forsaken dty 
life and is now lixing in Park Ridgc, lUinois. 
GEORGE MAXGAN, formerly of Elgin, Illinois, 
is now U\*ing in Birmingham, Alabama. MIKE 
TEDERS, the Indiana flash, has been in Pittsburgh 
for some time. Mi^c, I >*"ish you would work on 
ihc nucleus of 1931 men in that area and bring 
them all back next June. CUFF FISHER, who 
has been in Kansas City, Mo., for the past few 
years is now in the Chicago area and living in 
Morton Grove, 111. I had a letter from FREDDIE 
SWINT, who is now living at 4604 Toddington 
Drive, Nashville, Tenn. Fred has had a siege of 
illness the past year or so but is now on liis feet 
and doing %vcll again. Fred Js in the accounting 
business and has two children lo keep him on 
his toes. He plans on making the reunion in 1961. 
I had a wonderful letter from Marie and JIM 
McQU.AID dated June 5th Avhicli was their 23rd 
wedding anniversarv-. Their Magazine Rack loca­
tion was torn down because of nc\»* highwaj-s so 
they are operating the Old Post Bookstore in tlic 
Student Union Building at Vincennes Univcrsit\-. 
Marie is taking a refresher course to go back to 
teaching and Jim hopes that wjlh his teaching 
experience he can 5er\c in guidance and limited 
coaching again. Both arc planning on making 
ihc I96I REUNION'. The>- mention receiving 
subscriptions from ART McMANMON and LEO 
KLETZLY. Leo has a son in the seminarv* in 
Rome. Another of their faithful \Tsitors is JACK 
ELDER, who ahvays stops on his way throm?h 
Vincennes. Another Reunion supporter is JIM 
MULVAXEV, who said he had a letter from 
JOHX BURKS which indicated that he and TED 
TOOMEY would lead the Xc%v York contingent 
to the campus next June. 
By no%v' you should have received your pre­rcunion mailing list sent out by the Alumni OiHcc to all the Reunion, classes. I will get together with a group in Chicago to select \'arious regional com­mittee members who will be asked to help in making this one of our best reunions. I am sure there is enough life in all of you to make this a memorable event. 
From the Alumni Office: JIM DOYLE was robbed of the announcements by an early dcadh'nc, but tlic reunion-bound can celebrate new distinctions for tlic Class of '31.

Your secretar\' is writing this column before the Strptcmber ALUMNUS has been distributed so 

 treasurer; BUI Murphy, secretary; and Steve  treasurer. 
there has been no plaj'back to me from that issute. A number of us, however, have started to work o » and talk about the most important reunion, of our lives next June. Early in July, JLM SHERRY, ART GROXIX, HAL STIXE and I spent a wonderful evening at GEORGE WOLF's home discussing the "old days'* and ir\-ing to scheme up waj-s and means to influence all of you to attend our 25th next year. President Shcrrv* is appointing a local committee in the South Bend area and also will ask some classmates to stir up interest in their regions. .fVs soon as these are all lined up. we'll get out a special m:uljng to acquaint you with the plans. Already you have received from the .-Mumni Ofiice the "kick ofT' announcement and a cla^jg­roster. Get busy now to make sure your roonX mates, neighbors, friends and possibly foes from our class are gathered at Xotre Danie June 9, 10 and 11. 
Continuing our reports on the sur\-ey we ran last fall, here are some additional new news items from far and wide. BILL FI*j\XNERY is an at­torney with DeWitl, Xast & Diskin in X'ew York. Bill is the father of three clitldren but suffered the great tragedy of the death of his wife in 1956. Bill's law specialty is in libel, copyright and trade­mark, and he serves as a counselor to magazine publishers and ncwspaptrs. He expects to attend our 25th. JOE FOX is in Rochester, X'ew York, where he is a financial administrator for the Rittcr Com ^ : pany, manufacturers of dental and medical equip^ '-. mcnt. Joe has two children and expects to play a \ lot of golf during our next reunion. ! 
BOB Mc&\BE is cliatnnan of the English De­partment of King's College in WUkcs-Barre, Penn­syh-ania, whicli is a school operated by the Holy Cross Fathers. Bob is the father of twin sons and states that he was one of the pioneer faculty mem­bers of this relatively new college. In commenting on our request for suggestions for improring class spirit. Bob writes as follows: *'H3rd to say—we are depression boys—war boys—maybe tlie reunion w'ill be the spark needed—distance and time wreck havoc with old tics—but it is still Xotrc Dame io^k me." ^^ 
PETE XEMETH is a lawyer in South Bend where his son is at X'otre Dame, one daughter at St. Mar>-'s Academy and two daughters at home. Pete lias been kind enough to offer Iiis assistance In any u-ay that would be helpful in connection with the local arrangements and plans tor the 25th reunion. FRED ^fcXEILL is an arcliitcct and vice president of tlic Cunlifi* Company in St. Louis, Missouri. Fred has two daughters. Ifc said he spent about tlircc weeks in Mexico last summer where he saw quito^ a lot of EXRIQUE CREEL who is practicing arcliiw lecture in Mexico City. 
PAT MALLOY is in the general practice of law specializing in trial work in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Pat has three sons and a daughter. He suggests that w*e mail a questionnaire like the previous one once a year and also suggests that wc put some additional questions with it. Tlianks for the ideas, Pat. DICK SXOOKS is president of tlic Citizens Loan & Sav ^ 

o
tngs Company in St. Joseph, Missouri. Dick has 
four children, one of whom is at Notre Dame. JUSTIN OTOOLE is also a banker, being vice president of the Standard State Bank in Chicago. Justin has three daughters and contends that three days of reunion acti\'itics ought to be more than enough. 
JIM PAGUASOTTI is an office furniture sales­man for the Hcalcy Company in Fresno^ California. He has four daughters and sees no prospects for 
lelping Kuharich's recruiting problems in the fu­

CI ture. Jim is the only respondent to the sur\"ey who wants to do a lot of bowling during our reunion. He sa^-s that years ago he wrote several letters to a previous class secretary' and nc\-er got them pub­lished. He, therefore, decided that they didn't want neu-s from the western Indian country. He says that a boy by the name of Lamonica, a new quarterback from his part of the country, should make history at Notre Dame. Well, Jim, this will prove to you that we Xiill try to publish letters cicn though we mav be a little late. 
a 
MATT THERXES is head football coach and ^thtetic director at the South Dade High School 
o; 
n Homestead, Florida. He has four cliildren and expects to attend our reunion- TOM REARDON is general manager of Dakota. Iron, a farm implement distributor in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Tom "Writes as follows: "Congratulations on the efforts of you and JIM SHERRY in sending out the enclosed questionnaire. It is a difficult job, I know, upon vhtch you arc embarked. Nonetheless, I question whether there are any of us that received the ALUMNUS but what regret the lack of contact as we read the column from the Class of '36. If there is anything on an individual basis that you t^*-o guys sec I can be helpful upon, I would be more than delighted to lend a hand." Thanks, Tom, for the nice comments. I am sure that Jim Sherry will es­pecially appreciate any help 'you can give on making sure your friends and yourself attend the reunion. This is about all the space I am afraid the editor •will let us have this time but you'll be hearing from us again with a special class letter; in fact, this letter may reach you even before this column is printed. Although the sur\'e%' results, I am sure, are interesting, we would still like to publish letters or other news items of more current interest when any of you get the ambition to drop me a line. 
From the /Uuinni Oflice: Tiic expected activity of R.\Y HERRLY on the [ocal reunion committee must be curtailed slightly.

N.D. Probably brought his own radiators along. . . . Al also sent a picture of this fellow Lessclyong, working hard at a Tonka Toy convention in Miami. The Secretary can report the arri\-al of Margaret Catherine to the Quinn liouseliold to associate her­self with 3 boys. The family is now complete. (Famous last words). 
JERRY BES;\NCENEY, from Nexvark, Ohio, and Material Analyist for North American AWation sent the Secretary a fine letter covering his last visit to school at reunion time, saw "IKE" among the crowds there. Jerry is all set for '62 after having seen what the Class of '35 came up with for a real time. He ran into VIC C/VRTON tlie old mail man from Dillon Hall, then had a talk with FATHER GLUECKERT, and PAUL GUARMERIE and fi­nally had to settle with Cackley at the Foundation Office. Jerrj- has one son attending Augusta Mili­tary Academy in Virginia and wants to follow a military career after checking on his father's activi­ties in the U.S. Navy. Jerry has promised to show-up in '62 driWng his auto bearing Ohio license ND-37, which has been his special number since *33. Another long lost name appears in the column this time from the Newport Festi%'al Fiasco, at which wdl-to-do, misunderstood youths arc trampled on by the local gendarmes, namely, DAN LEO SULLIVAN, director of training at tlie Newport Naval Base, and also officcr-in-charge of the Naval Reserve Officers School at Newport. He refers to 
the latter group as **an organuation of broken doivn Reserve Officers of W^VII and Korea who once a week attempt to gather enough points for retirement." This type of description of my Supply Corps JG Rank at 175 pounds I object to. Good fast Na\y men like NIENABER and JORDAN are also in this classification. Sully sums up the Jazz Festlv-al of July 4th as a possible half million dollar laxv suit against the city, ^fany thanks for your report Sully, and I can report that Toots Shor sold the joint after we paid for most of the furnish­ings. That was tough duty at Pier 92. 
The final report comes from one of my better correspondents, EDDIE HOYT- Ed nmv lives in East Paterson, N.J., a very acdve menAer of the Board of Education, a teacher c*'enings at City College of New York; and during the daylight hours he manages to make a living with U.S. Rubber Company. His brother was very close to Cardinal O'Hara and made the trip to Rome with his Excellency. Ed and his family planned to attend the ser%^ccs in Phila. {Class of *37 should all re­member Cardinal O'Hara in their prayers.) During the summer months Ed kept busy running tours up and down the east coast for a large travel agency in N.Y.C. 
Finally, my friends, wc have a job to do for the 25th. I ^v-ill be writing for more news, so please cooperate by sending back the Information. One other thing, don't give me the line of "as I sit here drinking my martin! or Scotch, I thought of you" stufT; I am running out of aspirin. . . .

South Bend 25, Ind. 

That big splash you heard July 23cd vvasn't the Polaris missile, just NELSON VOGEL and DON FISHER hitting the breakers of Lake Michigan at CHARLEY DUKE's Long Beach home near Michi­gan City, where the South Bend class of '38 en­joyed their annual summer picnic this year. Duke moved up here last spring from New Orleans to become resident airport consultant at Chicago's O'Hare Field. In simple words, Charley's job Is to keep peace among 16 airlines while they spend $120 million in an expansion program. Roaming Charle>-'s three stor\' lakeside cottage and rompln* on the beach were BILL GIBBONS, CHARLEY BOROWSKI, JAKE BURKE, DON HICKEY, .\L\RCELLUS BALL, CL.\\TON JODON, LOUIS ANDERSON, JIM L-AHEY, CHUCK S^VEENEY, ST;\N AMHTE and ED CRONIN —all properly chaperoned by their wives. Unhappily absent was your class secretary who, with wife Helene and seven of the little Bauers, was on a trip to the Black Hills w-here eldest son Pat was employed as a guide in Bcthehem Cave. On the ivay wc had lunch with SCOTT REx\RDON in Sioux Falls, 
S. Dak. and coming bock \^itcd with TOM BOHEN in St. Paul. Scott, as fit and peppery as when he ^*"as our Junior year class president, is in business w*ith hts father in the Dakota Iron Store, when not campaigning for Nixon whom he knew when he ^^'as in the FBI. However he does have a lovely Avife, a spacious new home, a well-mannered son and a charming daughter to console him when the returns are in this November. Tom is also in­terested in the campaign but on the other side of the ticket, when he's not teaching at St. Thomas College. At least one of them will be happy when it's all over. 
Speaking of splashing. CHARLIE ^VELSH, a suburban Phllodelphian, toured the campus In mid-
Noire Dame Alumnus, November, 1960 25 
August with his son, who was especially interested 
in Rocknc Memorial Pool since he is on his high 
school s\*'immins team, Charlie^ a chemist, was 
given the VIP treatment by CHARLIE CALLA­
HAN who just returned wt h wife and son from a 
trip to Boston to \'isit his folks. 
Speaking of politics, the voice of BILL "T­BONE" iLVHOXEY came thru loud and clear at the Democratic National Convention \v^ien he voted Arizona's delegation for Kennedy. Bill, a member of the Alumni Board, headed the Arizona Kcnncdy-for-President organization. 
Speaking of Presidents, the class of thirty-eight has a few. TOM Frr2GERj\LD is now President and General Manager of tlie Mallorj' Capacitor Company of Indianapolis where he lives with his wife and two boys age 7 and 8. Tom Joined Cater­pillar Tractor after graduation, tl\cn Allison Di\-i­sion of G^fC and later Stewart-Warner Corporation interrupted by three years in the Na\y you know when. Up in Kalamazoo GEORGE LAURE is Pres­ident of the ^V-L Molding Company which lie or­ganized himself in 1945 after being with ihe Upjohn Company as cliemical engineer for a number of years. George started his career after graduation in higli spirits, joining Seagrams Distillery as chemi­cal engineer In LauTcnccburg, Indiana and Louis­\-iIlc, Kentucky. Before going to Upjohns he ser%-ed a term on the liquor tasting committee—whicli should qualify him for a chairmanship of some kind at our 25th reunion. George's business now extends throughout North and South America and he just recently opened a new brancli plant in Meridian, >fississippi. George also has his own flv-ing com­pany, Lakala .-VWation Inc., and is a licensed pilot himself. George and his wiic have three clijldrcn: Jim, 15; Barbara, 18, a freshman this year at Micli­igan State; and Shirley, 21, who is getting married this September* 
Belated but happy congratulations to JOHN J. GORM.^N, who deserted bachelorhood last Decem­ber when he married the widoA\* of JAMES P. CLE.ARY, class of 1940, the former Kathleen Rogers of Grcenwidi, Conn, and Trinity College, Washing-Ion, D.C. "\Ve have 4 children. Two each from 15 to 2. .A. new life and a wonderful one!" says John, who is a manufacturer's representative and President of his owTi company too, The John J. Gorman Co. in ihc Fisher Building, Detroit. John's home address is 75 S. Deeplands, Grossc Pointc, Michigan. 
So far only tv\-o tliirty-cigUters have reported sons entering Notre Dame this year. Tliey are TOM WUKOVrrS and BOB AVTTECOTTON. Tom Cav­anaugh's son will be a Junior at N.D. this fall. 
Ma>'bc there's a recession but you w-ouldn't know it by tlie number of new homes that '38-ers arc moring into. The following moved into the gold coast of their respective communities: JACK LE.\DBETTER to 801 W. CoUege, Marquette, Michigan; BUN^NY McCORMICK to 1859 6th St., Uvcrmore, Calif.; HARRY FOX to 11 West 60th St., Netv York; WALT HARRIS to 277 Harrison Ave., Jersej* Cit>- 4; JOHN JUDGE WALSH to Beedhwood Road, Norwalk, Conn.; CHUCK OS­BORN to 7315 51st N.E., Seattle 15; CHUCK BEASLEY (who still has my half of the economics book wc shared, which may account for his great success) to 705 W. Saddle River Rd., Holiokus. N.J.; and JOE LcBLANC to B2I5 Dover, Houston 17, Texas. Father JOE R^VCE's neiv address is 1900 W. Bolivar Ave,, Milwaukee 21. 
OSCAR RYDELL's address has switclied from Rangoon, Burma, to American Embassy, APO 271, New York, whidi means he may still be in Burma. And CL^TiE MEES address has clianged from Los .Angeles to I040I Limerick .Ave., Chatsworth, Calif., wliich means he may still be in L..A. ^Vritc, you two, and set us straight! Father ATNCENT DEL.A\^% C.&.C. came back from East Pakistan to San Jose Parisli, Austin, Texas, which means that during last summer's hot spell he probably couldn't tell the difrcrcncc.

Please note the change of address for ali corre­spondence to tlie class secretary. The twentieth reunion of the class of 1940 was a 
•^O * fine success. If you were unable to attend^ your '-flassmates missed you and hope that the time schedule will work out for evcr>-one in 1965. Wc had about 125 men on hand and an exceUcnt job of preparations by class president JIM DOXOGHUE and his So. Bend Committee of DICK BURKE, JIM DEL.\H.\NTY, DON* HOSINSKI and DICK STEFFANIAK, added mucli to the University pro­gram. We had tlic Rockne Memorial for our Friday night huflTct and Saturday cocktail hour. A me­morial Mass was celebrated Saturdav morning bv our own FiVTHER PAUL HACKMAN and was at­tended well enough to complctelv fill ^forri55ev tapcl. FATHER JOHN a\Vv\XAGH gave a short Ik after this Mass. The food was choice and the beverages plentiful. The class is considerably belter Organized than wc have been in the post war era and the next one ^^II be even better. As usual the \'arious geographical locations -were well repre­sented: DICK LYNG, GEORGE MEEKER, REX ELLIS, and \'IX RYAS were in from California. Dick and his family have been in the seed business for many years and lately he has been quite suc­cessful in the insurance business. Next time you are in Modesto, stop in on him. \'in, unlontmatcly, was taken ill on Saturday with some internal trouble and spent the remainder of the week-end in a So. -^cnd hospital. Rex is a practicing attomev out tn Pia t area. From Texas wc had JOE SAITTA, WALT FLEMING, GEORGIE BECKER. You might be interested in knowing that Fl<:ming now has t\vo sons at N.D. A freshman and a sopho­more. The Jcrscv clan was well represented by PINDAR, JOHN KELLY, JOE .McKEOX, TOM FORD, ED HART and an old "skeeier" AL CALL.-VX*, long since transplanted to the Pacific Northwest, Seattle. Al was on our floor in Alumni and I often wondered where he had wandered. He has been in Seattle since the war, married a nurse from the area and they have nine children which must be near tops for our class, Al is an attorney 
^n d drove back to Chicago with me after the re­
•»lnion. He missed seeing his old hurdling crony, D.WE REIDY. Dave is now located In Washing­ton, D.C. Several of the monofframers, 20N*TINI, KELLEHER, CR.\NE, HESTER and KELLY were on hand early for the Monogram meetings. 
Saw a couple of fencers SMALLEY, S.-VYIA, GAVAN and GERRY DONOV.\N stjckins each otlicr with tales of yesterday. BUD KOTTE and AL KESSING were in from Florida and ED BADDOUR from the near south. The up-state New Yorkers JIM SULLIVAN and KEVIX 0*GOR­M.\N, wondering where CHUCK Mca\RTHY was. Had a long talk with PAUL HELLMUTH who, in ^ddition to being a member of one of Boston's xvell Wnown law firms, has of late been vcrv closely asso­ciated with DR. TOM DOOLEY, an N.D. man wlio has been establislting medical teams in So. East ^\sia. Tliis program is now taking on global aspects and Paul is assisting Dr. DooIc>' in the management of the whole program. Paul was made a trustee of the University this past June. The Chicago contingent was in evidence with TOM BRENX.VN, LISTOX, HENEBRY. HUSSEY and BERXIE .\LVSTERSOX. Tom had a little sickness last year but is back in shape. Liston is now president of Bcrgncr & Co., a department store . chain based in Peoria. Tlie usual X.Y. crew was Ma hand, DOWT), JIM KELLY, GUMMIXGS, ^lARTIN, SEXTOX, CELL.\; JIM ROGERS, who has been missing (spent some time with the Bureau in New Orleans recently); TUCKER (who has a son getting ready for N.D. .. . he hopes), OBERHOFER (now registering from Washington, D.C), BILL O'BRIEN, and BUD 0*DOXXELL. And of course, the inseparable were on hand: BIG Mc&VRTHY and HUSHEK, SAEGERT and the incomparable GILLIL.\ND. Incidentally, I have a blurb from GERRY ^AEGERT announcing a gct-toscthcr of MQ men " t the Pittsburgh game Nov. 5. Cocktails and possibly dinner after the game. South Bend was well represented by the above-named committee, as well as BUD TE.\H and BOB FROST, trans­planted from HicksviHc, Long Island. The service sent JOHN .McLNTYRE from the navy and DOUG BANGERT from the marines. On the way out I stopped in Cleveland on business and spent some g^ e with BILL COLE^L\N and his family. Bill 
Above arc represented two phases left be­hind in the career of John Gclston Smith, '49. Follo^ving 17 combat missions in Europe as a W.W. II pilot (inset), John was an honor student in Commerce and Law, a record-breaking hurdler, track captain and assistant coach. He joined the Chicago law firm of Lord, Bissell & Brook in 1950 and became a partner in 1958, having ser\'cd as assistant Illinois attorney general in Springfield 1954-57. John, wife Jo Ann and family live in suburban Lake Bluff, 111. 
^vas at the reunion on Saturday as his wife was expecting momentarily. This about recaps the 20th from mcmor>'. Please bear with the column if your name wasn't mentioned; it's difEicult to get 125 names in one issue. 
New twists to old get-togethers: B.VXGERT buzzed in the newest Marine jet equipment; .MEEKER and MI2E MORRIS flew their own private planes in from Missouri and California and PATERNO streaked in from Jersey in a bright red convertible MC sporlscar. "Hmes are changing; only 20 vears ago he was glad to ride in a ifodel A Ford that ROGERS, STAPLETOX and I bought for $35.00 in Soutlt Bend. This is truly progress. Had a couple of interesting letters from DICK xVMES and your old horn man, ^fIKE XLANDJ.ACK %vhich I \vill save for the next ses­sion. Wc will resume with the questionnaire and I will try to concentrate on those felIo\vs who were not at the reunion. Hate to close a reunion column irith a sad note but the mortality table grinds on: jiut prior to the reunion GEORGE SHE;^ from Brooklyn passed away. I know you will remember him in your prayer. 
COL. DOUG B.-VXGERT, mentioned above in the reunion reporting, recently assumed command of Marine .\ircraft Group 32 at the "Jet Stream" Sta­tion, Beaufort, S.C. The D.F.C. and Air ifedal winner and wife Dorothy live in Laurel Bay, S.C, with children Betty Jane, 16, Doug, Jr., 14, and Patty Ann, 8.

From the Alumni OfBce: 
For help uith nauonal promotion and local opera­tions of a gala Twentieth Anniversary Reuntoa, JIM SPELLMAN* the other officers and the local com­mittee should be able to enlist the services of sev­eral classmates with a special pipeline to the Alumiu OfHce and national alumni operations. Minnesota's BILL COTTER is immediate past president of the worldwide N.D. Alumni Assn. FATHER TOM O'DONNELL, associate director of the N.D. Foun­dation for years, is now alumni liaison ofiBcer. JOHN MacCAULEY and AL PERRINE represent the Foundation in eastern population centers. They'll have to combine the rctmion and the library drive. 
MILT PIEPUL, backfield coach at Brown U., Providence, R.L, can testify to that school's fond­ness for N.D. men. Having hired JACK ZILLY as end coach. Brown would probablv be only too happy to take on JOE KUHARICH and HUGHIE DEVORE after the next shakeup.

William M. Hickcy 3333 West 47th Place Chicago 32, Illinois 

;Vc have a nice letter from GEORGE CROW­LEY who no\v- lives at 22, Rose AValk, Purlcy, Surrey, England. He ^vrites as follows: "After leaiing school, as you no doubt kno^v, I joined the General Electric Company and started work in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and transferred from there to Ashcboro, North Carolina. Just last year I moved to England with my ivifc» Virsinia, and our four daughters. I have set up a new English Company here for the General Electric imder the name 'ilonogram Electric Limited.' The reason for the different name is in order to eliminate confusion at market level wth General Electric Company of England. The G.E.C. started in business several years before the General Electric Company was incorporated in the United States — therefore, for the time being, wc are operating under a difTcrent name for our appliance business. The only classmate I have seen so far is TOM KEN'NEDY, who came to England several montlis ago on business.'* 
\Ve also hear from BOB DE MOSS, 645 N. Tampa Ave., Orlando, Florida ^vho Avriles the following: 
"If any of the N.D. boys are ever in Orlando, the welcome mat is out-" 
From CHET LAMPERT, 58 ^Var^aw Street, Rochester 21, Ne%*- York, we hear the following: "In February, 1959, after a brief illness, my father died. In the same year I have been hos­pitalized because of a ncuro-muscular ailment. 
(V.A. Hospital, Buffalo, N.V.) I have made considerable progress, but I still have a disability. One result is I cannot get around much an>Tnorc. Presently, I'm housebcund. Hmve%xr, in the past 
— during ^Vorld War II — I was quite active. I have been with the U.S. Army Air Force, San Antonio, Texas. Later I was accepted into the Army Specialized Training Program, German-Area Section and trained at Bard College, B3rr\lown, Neiv York- Thereafter I served ^«th the European Civil AfFwrs Division in England, France and Germany. I was wounded in Normandy on July 31, 1944. Getting back to the present, I keep busy with a number of projects, which includes some writing; however, it*s all on a limited basis. I am single. My mother and sister are still living. I live with them." 
From ROBERT M. .MILLETT, 501 Englcwood Road, Middlesboro, Kentucky, comes the following: "After graduating from N.D. in December '42, I spent four years in the Navy [amphibious force. New Guinea and Philippines). Then studied law for four years at the University of San Francisco. During this same four year period, I ^vas baliff of the Supreme Court of California, sen'ing under Chief Jusuce Phil S. Gibson. Then I worked for seven years for the Millett Hardwood Lumber Company at ^fiddIesbo^o, Kentucky. The last t^vo years, I have been employed -as a walnut log buyer for the Chester B.

From JOHN J. GAVIN, 2612 Amhmt, Wichita Falls, Texas, \vc hear the following: "It was a pleasure to hear from you and to know* that you are still tlic long-suffering secretary of our illus­trious group. It -was also anything but a pleasure to be reminded that almost all of our friends from Notre Dame have not been seen for eighteen years. I moved to AMchita Falls, Texas, in 1949 in order to be associated in the ready-mix concrete business with my Freshman Hall roommate, TOM FOLEY. In tlie inicr\'ening years, Tom has become the leading citizen of this city of over 100,000 souls. W'c had a wonderful time building up a good business and raising our families. On March 31st of this year wc sold out to a group from Dallas and I purchased a general insurance agenc>' in order to be in business with my younger brother. Bob, who has just moved here from Indianapolis. ^Vc have high hopes for the future and wc are enjoying our new association immensely, Tliis is a wonderful place in whicli to live — the people arc truly some of the finest that can be found. One of our few complaints is the scarcity of N.D. men. Besides Tom and me, the only ones I can think of here arc JOE SAITTA, who has just announced the formation of a company to manu­facture sporting goods, particularly the new foot­ball shoe that Joe has developed; LOUIS BRO>\"X, who is superintendent of the large American Pctrofina refinery. If there are others the>- are keeping quiet about it. As for family, .the Gavins now have five cliildrcn ranging in age from fifteen to six, TIic Foleys also have five, ranging from thirteen to six. 
"It is either a sign of advancing age or a truly sedentarx- existence that I seem to have covered any items that may be of interest to our friends of 1942. Wc would enjoy licaring from some of them, if only to let us know that wc are still remembered."

Tlie questionnaires wc sent out in the summer have been cascading back at a surprisingly good rate: as of deadline date, Sept. 1, we had about lOO already. 
Concensus about the questions asked will be the 
Notre Dame Alumnus, November, I960 
subject for a later newsletter, but it can be re­
ported that 40 of our classmates have indicated 
thcj-'ll definitely be here for the 1962 reunion and 
30 others have said"Xfaybe. " 
So, even this early, the 15-year get-togcilicr 
shapes up as our best yet and you arc importuned 
to begin right now arranging your June. 1962, 
schedule so you'll be on campus for a wonderful 
time. 
— GLEASISGS — 
Sifting through the questionnaires, some of wliicli 
were signed and a fc»v* of ^^•hich bore additional 
memoranda, we learned that MIKE YARBEXET 
is a CPA in Erie, Pa.; that FATHER DA\^D 
SCHEIDER is teaching at Noire Dame High 
School in Batavia, N,Y.; that DON* HAINES is 
a Lieutenant-Commander aboard the USS Ren­
ville, and tl»al THURMAN L. COSS is Chairman 
of the Department of Philosophy and Religion at 
Hamline University in St. Paul, Minn., and is tlic 
father of four diildren. 
From JACK GALLOWAY in Albany, N.Y.: "I 
should have written many moons ago, but guess 
I needed this as a reminder. AVc were visiting 
FR.\NK KOWALSKI, '46, in Connecticut a short 
lime ago; he has a little girl. We have four — 
three bo\-s, one female. 
"I sfc R.\Y PEETS occasionally; he's now a

PHIL DELINCKE writes: "Sorry I have been so negligent in my correspondence, but you might say I'm working days, nights, and ^^•cekends, too. ^^y days arc devoted to improving waste ^vatcr and air pollution abatement practices for the Atlantic Refining Co. My nights arc devoted to impronng my technical background for increased \-alue to .Atlantic and myself through job security. And my weekends arc devoted to improving the finan­cial picture through magazine sales. 
"Truly I would like nothing better tlian to attend our 15-ycar reunion but cannot. Perhaps we can swing it a few years later. .. . I often daydream myself back to those happy days under the Dome. 
"Both Dot, my wife, and our daughter Sharon arc well and looking forward to a four-day holi­day at a Boardwalk hotel In Atlantic City this November. This will be our first completely in­dependent \-acalion since polio. Previously, help was required to lift up steps or transport my hospital bed. At Haddon Hall neither arc ncccs­sart'. Will let you know how we make out." 
Please do, Phil, and keep up the wonderful work. 
TETE-A-TETES During a trip East late this spring, wc en­joyed long «sits with MOOSE AfATTHEWS and BOB MULCAHY, formerly the scourges of 335 .Mumni Hall. The former, New Jerse>-'s youngest assembl>'man, is also called by the New'ark press the state's most eligible baclielor. You'll be reading about him in the SPOTLIGirr ALUMNUS feature soon, but it suffices to say Elmer is doing well in politics, skippers a. 28-foot cruiser, and hasn't lost that boyish Sense of humor. No bachelor, Mulcahy: He lives with his ^vife, Doris, and tlieir four children (three to one, favor of the boy's) not far from Jones Beach; his law practice is in Mineola, and so rabid an out­door dicf is he tliat he has been obser\-cd bundled up in the dead of winter cliarcoaling supper for his brood waiting patiently and warmly inside. Both intend to be here for the reunion, by the way, and this will be Bob's maiden return. Just the night before deadline, JOHN REGAN, '43, stopped in for a long cliat; he graduated with us, but his roote arc in MR. WIGGINS' cabbage patch. Still in 5er\icc, he is currently winding up his quest of a Master's degree at North Carolina, and expects to be assigned to Washington next stmmier. He inquired specifically about JACK HUPF, but the old "silent-as-in-swimming" kid apparently cannot find a w-ay to arch his news items over the Rockies. 
Three N.D. grads received the habit as Holy Cross novices in August ceremonies at Sacred Heart Novitiate, Jordan, Minn. They are (I. to r.): Willoughby Marshall, '47, Apalachicola, Fla.; Robert Schoenc­man, '59, Hawardcn, la.; and Jerr>' Flor­ent, '60, Michigan Cily, Ind. After a year they will pronounce first vows and con­tinue their studies at Moreau Seminary on the campus, as has Don McNeill, *5S (not shown), Mlnnetka, HI. 
PERSONALS JIM MURPHY, our academic tub-thumper ex­traordinaire, was named recently to the board of directors of tlie Indiana College Public Relations Assn. Always a good news source, Jim passes along %vord that: ED SWEENEY is with an insurance underwrit­ing firm in Seaford, N.Y., and that he nnd his wife Charlotte were expecting No. 6 offspring in September. Barbara and JIM KELLY have returned from Denmark, \vhere Jim has been in the American £mbass\', and are awaiting reassignment. DAVE KORTY, manager of a branch bank in Lafayette, Ind., was a visitor on the campus late in July. Another banker, DON McDONALD, and Murph reminisced a bit in Fort Wayne during the sum­mer; Don, executive vice president of a bank, is also a slate representative, head of the urban re­newal program in Fort \Vaync, and mastermind of a recent hospital fund campaign, which roared over the top. A note from the Alumni Office reveals DR. JOE FINNEY is with the State Mental Health Dcpt. in Honolulu.

THIRTY-THREE YEARS . . . .. . it has taken me to realize I am in the wrong profession!

If you haven't yet returned the questionnaire, please do so instanter. And do ever^'onc, yourself included, a favor by bringing us u[i-to-date on ^'our activities, legal and extralegal. You may withhold the illegal didoes, of course.

It is with deep regret and a saddened heart that I must begin this column \rith the report of the death of a classmate, GENE GEISLER, who died Jime 28. May you not fail to include in yotir prayers the repose of his soul. I am sure ^^jf Gcislcr Family will appreciate your spiritual gener­osity. Gene's home is 800 East Broadway, Midland, Texas. Expression of s^-mpathy is also extended to Leo Dilling on the death of his father, LEO T­DILLING, '33. 
Except for a few tidbits of ncu-s that I have scraped up from the bottom of my almost empty barrel of letters, this column does not promise to be a very "newsy" one. And unless >-our under-bur­dened secretary is deluged %rilh mail from every crook and cranny of the country in the weeks an ^ months to come, I will be accused of Sectionalism^ and what-have-you. So, please, *'Men of '60," send me a line in your moments of idleness and Icisiu-c and come to tlie aid of your (I hope not forgotten) Sec.

DENNY NOLAN, reports Dan, is tr>*ing to find a job in engineering. But it seems that no company will put up with him. JOE McBRlDE, who is a long way from his St. Louis, ^fich. home, is experimenting with rockets at Edward's Air Force Base in Cali­fornia. Good luck and success, Joe, in your ad­ventures in outer-space. MIKE HENDERSON is working at Aero-jet in Sacramento. Mike, you and

JIM THOMPSON has surrendered partially to love and partially to Merrill, L>Tich, Pierce, Fenncr & Smith by IcaWng his native California for two years of training in New York. His girl lives in Ohio. Both BILL KILLILEA and TOM AVARD have enlisted in tlic Air Force OCS program. JACK SALADINO is reported to be busy at Cranbrook Institute of Fine Arts in Detroit. During the past summer Jack worked as an interior de­signer for one of Kansas City's largest firms. Re­cently he and PETER J. QUINN (not to mention ^ic UI) \-isitcd friends in the business community of San Francisco, where Jack plans to practice in the future. TONY BARTOLINI is furthering his education at Loyola U. of Chicago in the Department of So­cial and Industrial Relations. Tony hopes to receive his master's degree sometime next year. Band-leader WALLY JONES is studying for a degree in music at Northwestern University. Per­haps Wally will be entertaining our children at the 
N.D. Victory Dances as a professional. 
Received word from my former roommate AL GRIFFIN. The six weeks of summer camp at Fort Knox, saw A\, was a "new and interesting ex­
perience.'' I certainly hope I will share mutual leelings when it's time for me to serve good ole Uncle Sam. Al has been accepted at St. John's Seminary in Boston where he will be diligently studying to be a diocesan priest. 
JOE RJXNALLO, struggling young medtcal stu­dent, fighting the bondages of his old family tradi­tion; is reported to be busily engaged in his medical studies at Temple University. 
Congratulations and best wishes to BOB TO­LAN D and Sue O'Ncil, who were married on June 25 in E\-anston, III. Another classmate to be Wc­timized by the love potions of cupid was CHARLES FARRELLY, who married Katherine Dill of

fellow dassmate PAUL PRIEBE, Rochester, Minn. The Pricbc family, ha%ing Just returned from show-ins their horses at the Minnesota State F:ur Horse Shtwv, provided me with a trusty **steed'* to ride while visiting the country. Although the horse is nearing old age, barely moves, is blind in one eye and is unable to see %vith the other, yours truly managed to take an eventful [all—the effects of which I am still experiencing. 
Incidentally, Paul is busy preparing sections of his thesis on the political-economic aspects of agri­cultural price supports for publication in the Min­neapolis Tribune. This, combined with his entering the University of Minnesota Law School and his building a motel in the loop area oE Minneapolis, will keep this N.D. grad busy in the coming months. 
The national political con%*entions were \'isited by several '60 gi^ds. In Chicago our own president, DICK CORBETT, ivas seen covering that political scene. LARRY TURNER, Golden Beach, Florida, and BILL MAFOTHER, Louisville, KentucJcy, took in the Republican Convention after travelling the eastern seaboard and making final plans for their September matriculation at the University of Vir­ginia Law School. Incidentally, I imderstand Bill and his family hosted many a lively weekend for some of our "battle-worn" classmates stationed at Fort Knox, Kentucky, this past summer. 
Rumor has it, L. KfARTIN TOPPING, White Plains, N.Y., spent much of his summer in the upstate New York area working on a novel, the publication of which we are anxiously awaiting. This and his newspaper activities in New York City have prepared Nfarty for his graduate studies at Columbia. 
On Oct. 15 of this year, immediately after the Michigan State game, our class will hold an in­formal get-together in So. Bend. This, our first class reunion, should prove to be a very interesting and eventful one. So do try to make it.

Alumni Association

October 15, 1960 Fellow Alumni: 
Since our last Alumni letter (January 31) there have been a number of developments worth reporting. 
June was a particularly significant month. At the kind invitation of Father Hesburgh, I was privileged to represent all of the Notre Dame Alumni in the group that met President Eisenhower at a private luncheon on his \'isit to the campus in early June, when he received an honorary degree and addressed the graduates. Father Hesburgh's kind consideration on this occasion will long be remembered. 
The following week end we attended the Reunion on the campus, made a report at the Alumni Banquet, at which well over 1,000 of us heard Father Hesburgh's remarkable address on Notre Dame today and the challenge to the University to become the leading center of influence and education in the world. 
During the Reunion we were particularly impressed with the newly introduced Traditions Banquet held on Friday night in the Morris Inn for all Alumni whose reunion was the 35th or longer. This included the 1925 class of the Four Horsemen back to the class of 1900. 
Concerning tiie Reunion, it would be most difficult for me to understand how any Alumnus could leave the campus, although fatigued, without feeling even a greater warmth for Notre Dame than when he left as a graduate. 
Two committees of the Alumni Board have now completed the two slates for the four new members of the Board for 1961. This is a difficult task in selecting nominees by geographical location, and at the same time, by class grouping. Ballots should be in the mail shortly. 
I know that all Notre Dame men share my sorrow at the death of His Eminence, our beloved John Cardi­nal O'Hara, whom many of us can best remember as the Prefect of Religion, when he edited the daily Reli­gious Bulletin, and encouraged us in the reception of daily Communion. And again, of course, as one of Notre Dame's great presidents. 
We have now all been informed as to Notre Dame's projected new thirteen-story library which Father Hes-berg terms "the Universit)''s most urgent and critical need." Father Hesburgh is relying upon the Alumni to contribute at least four million dollars in the next three years to help underwrite the project. 
In the waive of tiie library announcement came the news of the Ford Foundation grant of $6,000,000 to Notre Dame during that same three-year period provided that the University receives $12,000,000 during tiiat time from her Alumni and friends. 
The Alumni Board members are particularly pleased at the University's decision to immediately apply a sizeable portion of the Ford grant toward a retirement plan for administration (non-academic) employees, which is a program that has long been among the University's high priorit)' needs. 
What may later be termed the Library Foundation Drive will begin in early 1961. Meetings are being held and plans are being made in all areas of the countrj' for this most important Foundation Drive. Perhaps we should consider this challenge that the Ford Foundation has laid before us and agree that we should contribute to Notre Dame to the point of sacrifice. 
Sincerely, 
^( 
President
