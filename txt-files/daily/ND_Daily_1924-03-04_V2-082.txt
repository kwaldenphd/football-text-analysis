CAMPUS
BY-PATHS
I take great pleasure in present-
ing this letter, coming as a. jar to
my lethargy.
“Guardian’ of 'Campus-Cutups:
“Altho I hesitate to start out
with that time-worn phrase ‘I am a
constant reader of your paper’ I
have had a critical eye upori Cam-
pus By-Paths for ever and anon.
A word or two of compliment to in-
sure your publishing this letter—1
believe you have succeeded rather
well in interpreting campus events
arid peculiarities; Sometimes, per-
haps, you have added a little too
much pepper to your spice. Yet the
broth' on the whole has been excel-
’lent. (Yes, my name,' too, has been
’ taken in vain in your column.)
. “Now to the constructive part of
my bold advice: why .not. seek out
more., personalities \ among the
younger .men? Not, particularly,
regarding their romances and love-
• letters but about the things that
will sooner ' or later make them
known arid, liked among . all four
classes. •' Again, since the Ink Well
appears to be rather reticent about
printirig verse unless it has all the
wave-lengths, of. literature about it,
why not make a little verse a. part
of By-Paths more regularly? To
keep’ ydur from replying ‘what?’ al-
low- nie to include this thing, which,
altho my’own, -seems to hive all
the qualifications of thot and typog-
raphy. For want bf a riame it.is

Scribblers Discuss
Humor at Meeting
Various members of The Scrib-
blers read poetry, short stories, etc.,
which were criticized by the other
members, at the regular ineeting of
that club held last night. The fea-
ture of the meeting was a short
story by Robert O’Riordan, which
provoked lively discussion upon
humor, carried on between Frank
Kolars and Gerald Holland. ■ Mat-
ters of business, and short talks b/
the two; new members of the club,
James Withey and Gerald Lyons,
occupied the rest of the time.

DUJARIE WINS HOCKEY GAME
Dujarie Hall defeated Holy Cross
Seminary in an exciting hockey
game Sunday afternoon, 3 to 2.
The game was fast and had to. be
played overtime. The superior
teamwork of the' brothers was no-
ticeable throughout the game. For
Dujarie, Brothers Albert and Cyril
stood out prominently, while for,the
Seminary, Lane and Sullivan played
a good game.	.
| At the request of the Publica- ?
jtion Board, the.Faculty Contests
1 Board has investigated the pro-1
j cedure of the recent DAILY’S j
| Best-Organization Contest. Thej
?purpose of the investigation was j
s to clear of any reproach all those 1
(concerned with the contest. . Af-I
Jter detailed and minute exam-j
i' ination, the Contest Board saw
fit to nullify the decisions which :
have been previously announced. 1
I The reason for such actions are J
j as follows:	|
j 1. The rules of the contest j
5were not' formulated before the?
| contest begun, but were made to I
I suit conditions that arose as thej
| contest was in progress. ... . - j
| '2. Ambiguity in the publica-1
jtion and promulgation of the J
(rules of the contest.	I
I 3. Large number of duplica-l
1 tions among the votes.	J
I 4. The contest editor miscon-j
jstrued and misinterpreted thej
j rules to the various orgariiza-1
| tions.	1
|	5. The Faculty Board was ap- j
I pointed, after the sixth ballot, i
f The Faculty Board as an organi-r
j zation did not make any of the 1
J rules governing the contest. 1
|	6. Proxy idea (voting byl
? proxy) was not known to all the j
1 clubs at the same time. :	■
17. Evidence of fraud among:
the students in permitting the in-.|
J discriminate use of their names. 1
j 8. Many who were not sub-1
: scribers for the DAILY voted, J

Ihas decided because of the fore-?
J going reasons to declare, the con-|
j test invalid, and has ordered the |

Rumor Says Rockne is Wanted by Iowa;
3;456th Offer Turned Down, Says Writer
: Ever- since the" completion ' of
Knute' Rockne’s first 'year of foot-’
ball; coaching at" Notre Dame,
tempting offers' have beeriLmade /to
him to leave his; Alma Mater to
coach other institutions. If a sta-
tistican had been employed'for the
purpose of keeping account ‘ of all
the offers, the poor fellow would,
by.this time, be sorry he ever fooled
with statistics. For now comes anr
other rumor that ;the University of
Iowa is seeking the services of
Rockne. This is about the 3,456th
university that has tried to pry
away our; coach, or our’ statistical
ability is' not up, to. snuff. It has
cbme jto pass ‘that a university is
not''up-to-date unless' it throws a
tempting offer in front' of our
coach—From the -Pacific-coast - to

erty of thought , and expression.
We often read' in these, absorijing
magazines about the joys.,of noh-
restriction, the. “emancipation of
women,” and, “new, hands on. the
government. reins.”.. Much of .this
is written solely for ..those - people
who stay at horned ‘ Filially we. open
oiir eyes,' unless they have b^en. al-
ready ‘ opened, 'to see' that' there is a -
lot of bunkum .adroitly mixed ih-
with the noble' truth?" This free/
dom is often present;1 but, at" the
same time, it is ‘not infrequently
used for base ends' or not used at '
all. Others are to be found in an
unhampered atmosphere, who know
the true value of freedom and ap-
ply themselves unto wisdom'accord-
ingly, without the hindrance of
overhead restriction.; " .?

an almost - unprecedented ? amount

!	’ Who Is Right? " :
Professor T. H. Reed of the Uni-
versity ?of Michigan; says that from
college men comes the idealism, of
a community. William Allen .White,
in a recent editorial claims', that
college men are /a “bunch of brass-
lunged, 'money-spending snobs' who
snub the few choice spirits that
come to college to seek out reason
and the will of “God.”
: ; Controversy , as to the; status of
the .'present day college youth has
assumed nation-wide proportions
and.mqny •widely known editors and
educators are battling over . the
merits of the university-bred man. >
; Somebody’s- wrong. If the col-
lege student is -a “brass-lunged,
money-spending * snob,’,’./ Professor
Reed’s notion ;of idealism is rather
queer./ “The. idealism ;of: a com-
munity.,, comes to . a large extent
from the college-graduates who are
members of that community,” said
Professor Reed. “This idealism is
one:of :the .greatest factors in mak-
ing, the college graduates leaders bf
the;.country,Tor.the masses turn to
the idealists for their leaders.”—

Notre Dame?s. swimmers have en-
tered into the final round of prep-
arations for the big meet with In-
diana Saturday night at the South

practice will. ,be held in the down-
town pool for the-entire team.. Bas-
kets for the . .water basketball game
to follow the meet, have, been erect-
ed and final plans have been made
for, the first game of this sport to
be held at Notre ,Dame,
The contest was transferred from
the Notre’Dame pool'to the South
Bend natatorium because i of the
better accommodations for handling
the crowd. The South Bend pool
is located on W. Washington street,
and. can be reached by either the
West Washington or Circle Avenue
;car.
: As the Bloomington tankmen are
well' known for /their aquatic -per-
formances' throughout the middle-
west . Goss’; proteges will be pushed
to their best. This will probably
be the feature meet of the season’s
schedule and . should, provide the
big chance of the'year for Notre

at least, her, prestige among swim-
,ming teams.
Announcement was. - recently
made. by the swimming, instructor
that. special permission had' been,
secured to admit all • students on
their regular athletic J tickets. The
price of- admission for others will
be 50 cents. According to present

speaking of the idea of compulsory'

Editor, The DAILY:
The quaint observations ' and
unique'suggestions put forth Sun-
day by the real, honest-to-goodness,
red-blooded, big-hearted he-man; G.
K., who wants to DO AWAY WITH
THE HOTELS because he fears
that lobby lounges are corrupting
the youth of the nation, were much
more amusing than the intolerant
wail broadcasted by the conscien-
tious objector, G. F;, in .the Satur-
day issue. Both letters were,. in
the manner of puerile compositions,
most diverting, but I think that G.-
K.’s missive was the more chuck-
lingly radical. Its .phraseology
was . typical of the two-fisted,
bronze-visaged Bill Hart, man of
the great open spaces.
G. K. must hail from Zion City.
He calls the men .who may some-
times be found in a hotel lobby
cushion clowns and infers that
those, males who frequent smok-
ing stands are oolong guzzlers and
pastry sniffers. . His power of de-
duction are truly uncanny. I won-
der if he has ever noticed-the foot-
ball men who sometimes spend a
few moments of leisure in the easy
chairs of a down-town hostelry. If
he had, walked through the lobby
of the LaSalle on a certain evening
last week he would have seen four
men of last year’s eleven, two bas-
ketball men, a well-known Univer-
sity boxer, and two profs, occupy-
ing lounges.
F.G.bemoans the fact that he sees
the lounge boys every afternoon,
evening, and night at the Oliver
and LaSalle. If this deplorable
sight of chairs is so offensive ‘to
him, why doesn’t he stay away from
the hotels?
,1 am not addicted to the habit of
lounging. I believe . that it, like
anything else, can be carried to ex-
cess. Occasionally, however, when

CADILLAC,CORBY
AND CARROLL WIN
Sunday’s Interhall Loop Games
•• Prove Fast; “Curley” Ash
Scores 14 Baskets.
Spectacular shooting and excep-
tionally; fast handling of the ball
featured the:three interhall basket-
bhll games played in the gym: Sun-
day.- Carroll defeated Day, putting
it two full games in the lead; Cor-
by .• won from Sophomore, and
Freshman was handed a defeat by
Cadillac. The Walsh-Badin, game
and -also the contest between
Brownson and Sorin were post-
ponedt<until later in the week.
XThe Carroll team defeated the
Day shooters in . one of ; the fastest
■iriterhall cage battles that has been
played this season. Both teams had
trouble finding the basket during
th'ef early part . of the game, and it'
was not ■ until Carroll sunk a few
throws that' the squads really got
into action. Even then the major-
ity of the shots were wild,’due to
the successful efforts of the guards
who kept the forwards . . shooting
from the middle of the floor.'' Dur-
_ ing the first period ’Carroll was
able to register r but seven points
and Day five. With the score tied
McNally dribbled the entire. length
of the' court■ and sunk a pretty bas-.
kef,' 'putting Carroll - ; ahead ; two
poihts when'the half ended.-;;
The' brilliant' work of ’ Herb ert,
Carroll guard, featured the second
half. Playing oii the defense' he
tossed in three field goals from the
middle of the floor,-each, time put-
ting Carroll -'ahead when its lead
was in danger of being overcome by
Day. Carney and Johannes played
nice games for Day, although the
work of Maxwell and Dahman,. Car-
roll guards, prevented them from
scoring heavily. The Day team was
able to sink but two field, goals in
the! entire game, ten of their points
coming from free-throws. Kerwin
of ’Carroll' played; his; usual flashy
. game. - f'; ‘	:	(.
Day is; protesting the game -on
. the; grounds of a. misunderstood de-
- - cisibn by the referee during the'last
minutes of play, in regard to-Car-
ney, a Day man, returning to the
game. The v question will' be de-
cided at the next meeting of the
Athletic Board.
In a game marked by the sensa-
tional and accurate ; shooting of
Ash, Corby? forward, the Soph lobp-
. ersjwere handed a 24 to 46 defeat
by ?Corby. The. first half was’un-
usually close, first 'one team and
then the other being, ahead.; Corby
had a little the better of the con-
r test the first half and the score at'
the' end stood 16 to 14 in its favor.
Edwards and Reid performed- in
nice syle for Sophomore.
At the start of the second ?half,
“Curley”. Ash started a bombard-
ment at the basket and the final
whistle found a total of 29 points
chalked up to 'his“‘credit. This ; is
the highest individual record to be
established this season, his’ score
• alone beating the-Soph team by five
points. Crowley added 'his share
to .the total with four field 'goals.
; The score of <46 points rung up.by
Corby.also is-a new record for the
hall teams .to shoot. at. , t x
; Cadillac’s team won ■ its fourth
game of the season when it carried
off the heavy end of a 21 to 19;
score from the Frosh tossers. Fresh-
man had a little the better of-the
encounter during the first half, aue
to. the efforts of Devault and Lu-
akts,:-who' both played scrappy
games, and the score at the end, of
the frame was 7 to 6 for Freshman.
: Cadillac came back strong in the
last period, however, and displayed
a brand of playing that was too
much 'for Freshman' to overcome.
The scoring ability' and team work
of Conley,' Thode and Gray were
the outstanding features of the
game. Conley registered a total of
13 points. Devault was high sedr-
with eight baskets.

Ash Leads Hall
Basket Shooters
: The -' interhall basketeers -: 1 are
playing fast games and running up
high scores every Sunday. There
is a close fight for the highest in-
dividual score, between Curly Ash,
of Corby,' and Butch DeVault, of
Freshman. Ash is' leading ■ the
scorers • at present; and his 14' bas-
kets in Sunday’s game make his po-
sition rather secure. He is closely
pressed by De Vault, who has
reached the loop 30 times to date. .
The.'other halls, have their own
candidates for the leadership.
Among them are Stuhldreher, Sor-
in, and Connelly, Cadillac. Stuhl-
dreher is known for 1 his uncanny
•ability to find the basket from the
center of the floor and his con-
sistent work has greatly aided the
Sorin five. Connelly is a fine play-
errand his point-getting is greatly
appreciated by Cadillac. U
.Carroll, the leading team, has no
outstanding star. ’ Howard, 'Max-
well, and McNally contribute even-
ly to the point, column and thus
lessen the chances, for a high point
man. Rigali, Badin/ Rileyi Brown-
son, and Nyikos,- Day, are the oth-
er leaders.
