Three shattered field " records
coupled with thrilling races attend- ’
ed Notre Dame’s * winning for the
tenth consecutive time of the Ind-
iana intercollegiate track and field
meet on Cartier field yesterday;
The Irish colors finished with a
total of 53 3-4 points while Butler,
the popular challenger of Rockne’s .

wind that blew down on the field
aided: the runners 'in the century,

tion will be extended to approxim-
ately 500- other colleges and' sec7
ondary schools, according to. an an-
;nouncement .of the College Burr
eau of the Republican National
Committee, Washington. .

< Hundreds of men in that line were in attendance at (the first joint

- " In . this way Notre Dame has taken a place in the front ranks
' along another line. ’Notre Dame chemists were instrumental in bring-
ing some , of the biggest men in the field, such as Dr. Gerald L.

society, and Mrs. Lee F. Supple, also of Chicago, and were in charge
- of all details',of the program. /
• They have done- a great work, It is_pleasing jqjnote the. healthy,
interest in their life work. The chemists7 have a difficult course and
a difficult work, arid they realize it. In order to get the most possible
z . out of their college education they worked' for the convention and
: got it. Thus they reaped the benefits of Their labor.
Good work chemists! Keep it up.

Termites, or “white ants,” are often blamed for the backwardness
of the tropics. The little insects have an insatiable appetite .for
woodhouses, furniture; stores and fences fall to dust altho a few days
before they appeared perfectly sound, on the surface. Railroads
.' through tropical forests can not use wooden ties, but must import, at
. . a great cost, steel and iron ties which are'not food for the ants.
. Tlie insects, it is . reported,. are not fooled when . the wood, is
made into books, and they work their way through a 12-volume set
• 3n a short time.	■' •	;
The tropics are naturally a backward7 region, and many causes
y 'for this have been, advanced, the chief, one being that the climate
is such that it causes laziness. i.The “white ant” theory, is one of the
late ories. It’ is' a plausible one, and illustrates that small .causes
often . have big effects. ?	' ’	, . \	'

is reported to have said that he
was an anarchist, that he did not
believe, in law because law meant
forcing people to do what they
ought to do of their own accord,
that he was an atheist, an icono-

with the instructor on everything
which the wise man taught. What
else the man in question may have
said or done is not generally known.'
He may have solved problems which
the sages have never, solved and
which the instructor was afraid to
give out,' he may have been dis-
agreeably blatant, said things which
may have1 shocked a.ny good and

The. pendulum of our national life is, perhaps; bn, a returning
oscillation, or is, at least,, at the point of poise. It seems that
we have become surfeited of ultra-intellectualism,, intelligensia, fool-
osophy, and flappers. Now that almost all. youth agrees with the
conventions of imconventialtiy; now that the magazine with the larg-
est circulation is one of a type that is intended for these youths;
now that these youths have, created, about all the havoc in recognized
standards that they can; it seems that we iriay Have a return to

A new organization known as the

that freshmen wear the headgear

at Ohio State University. Some of

to disregard this rule were speedily
shown their mistake by, means of

Notre Dame Meets
Badgers Tomorrow
The last big home game of the
1924 baseball card will be played
on Cartier field tomorrow afternoon
when Notre Dame clashes with the
Wisconsin Badgers in the first of
a home and home series. The only
other game remaining on the sched-
ule for the home diamonds is the
engagement with the Michigan Ag-
gies.	'
A triumph over Wisconsin will
complete what may easily be called
one of the. most succesful baseball
seasons: run off at Notre Dame in
several years. The Badgers have a
powerful club this year that will
tax every department of the Notre
Dame nine. The Badger mentqr
carris a corterie of dependable
pitchers. Who his choice will be
for the encounter with Notre Dame
has not- yet been announced, but
he will probably select one of the
following three: Luther, Johnson'or
Christiansen.
On two occasions, the Cardinals
have found Purdue club a special
jinx, the second meeting resulting
disasterously for the Badgers. The
first meeting -required twelve in-
nings' to complete the slug 'fest
which Wisconsin won, 10 to 9. The
second game went to the Boiler-
makers and on both occasions, the
/.Hoosiers found little difficulty, in
hitting the Cardinal twirlers. . Wis-
consin’s meeting with Illinois gave
the, Badgers a big boost in the con-
ference ranks, since Illinois was
leading the Big Ten with a perfect
record. Wisconsin stepped on the
Illinois field and handed ’ the title
hopes of Coach Lundgren a cutting
defeat, the final total being 3 to 1.
Notre Dame defeated Illinois the
day previous by a score of 7 to 0.
Dugan in the' right garden for Wis-
consin has proven to\be a promin-
ent factor in the' Badger’s . work
this season. Among his teammates
;>-who Lave.lalso^made -theiri presence,
felt at bat are Luther, Goos and
Christiansen.. The probable line-up
for Wisconsin will be: Tangen, 3>b.;
Elligson,. ss.'; Ascherner, c.; Eman-
uel, cf.; Goos, 2b.; Servatius, If.,
and Steer, lb.	<

Many questions will be raised and
left unanswered between now and
the day of the Gibbons-Carpentier
fight at Michigan City. After* the
battle is over there will be a great
many “ifs” in the air, and ring fol-
lowers all over the country will
fight the battle • over again. The
pre-dope, as dope goes, says that
the outcome of the fistic engage-
ment will be decided on the relative
speed of the two fighters.,
Gibbons has the edge in the mat-
ter of a consistent past. The St.
Paul battler ever since he mixed it
with Dempsey at Shelby, has been
hitting along at'a normal pace in
comparison with the course followed
by the idol of France. Carpentier
has fought some.rather hectic fights
since he last appeared in America.
There is a big possibility that he
will not be able to show that flash
of speed which came so near to
giving him the' title belt in the
Dempsey mixer. After his argu-
ment with Siki, he lost interest in
the ring game and has not given
so much time to training since then
as he , has since he signed to box
Gibbons.	' ,

Walsh will have a strong opponent
in Ccrby this week. As ths season
has progressed Corby has developed
