Dear Mr. Grundy: •
We saw in Sunday’s By-Paths
. that the distinctive Mr. Michael H.
Cenedella has only eight votes. We
were withholding our vote because
it seemed a fair tie between Mr.
Carfango 'and 'him. Last Saturday
Mr. Cenedella received two dozen

The Notre Dame basketball team
will open their eleventh game on
the schedule tomorrow night when
the highly touted Michigan Aggie
quintet stops off at South Bend to
meet the Irish on the “Y” court.
' The Aggies have enjoyed a fair-
ly successful season thus far, al-
though not being credited with any
spectacular wins. The clever Mich-
igan five which went down to de-
feat before the Irish. eagers in a
last-minute battle' were forced to
fight to' their utmost to down the
smart Aggie five in their recent bat-
tle at Lansing. The Farmer’s cage
team has an exceptionally good de-
fense and. due to this they kept
Michigan at bay during the entire
game, while they kept dropping
baskets-which 'hhd the.score-evened
in the final minutes o? play until
the Wolverines took a sudden jump
and rung up a^-pair of counters.^
The visitors are expected to ex-
hibit an unusually strong - floox*
game and with this end in ‘Anew,
Coach Keogan is drilling his men
toward a better offensive game,
hoping to smash down the opposi-
tion of the farmers with some con-
sistent'basket shooting. The vis-
itors will have a pair of floor guards
that have done some very clevex*
work all during: the season and
will be worth watching in the game
Saturday night.'	' .
The Irish five is still stinging aft-
er the lose last Saturday—a hard
grueling struggle in which the
Maylmen gave a better performance
than was possibly realized against
heavy odds. The effect of the loss
will undoubtedly show in the game
Saturday night and the Aggies are
due stiff battle.	■ •
Expected to Present Act;
Further Plans Today.
Plans for an all-campus carni-
val, wits every student organization
taking an active part,' formed the
business of the special Student
Activities Committee meeting yes-
terday noon in the library.
Jim Swift, chairman of the S. A.
C., briefly outlined the plan of the
carnival. Each'organization on the
campus is expected to' present an
act of some sort, be it acrobatic,
comic, or musical in form. A time
limit' of several minutes will be
set for each act. Nothing elabo-
rate or finished is expected. The
entire evening is to be more of a
student body get-together than any-
thing else. At the close of the car-
nival a cup will be presented to the
club whose act receives the least
amount of applause. The admis-
sion fee charged will be just
enough to cover the cost necessary
in putting across the production.
It was suggested .that the presi-
dent, of each of the upper classes
constitute a committtee to examine
and inspect the acts to be produced
by the various plubs or campus or-
ganizations.	-
Because of lack of time, further
plans concerning the' “convocation
of fun” were left unfinished until
a meeting to be held at noon to-
day in the South room. of the li-
brary. All clubs not represented
at yesterday’s-meeting'are 'request-
ed to send delegates to this meet-
ing.	' ;

ing speakers, eats, smokes, and the

Advance Sale to Own Classmen
Heavy; Benson’s Collegians
to Play.
Sophomore Cotillion, tickets will
be placed on sale for upper class-
■men Friday no'on, - January 25.
Tickets may be secured from John
Roach or John McMullen" in Sorin
hall and Mark Mooney, in Corby.
During the past week the sale
among ’the Sophomore class has
been extremely heavy and only a-
few tickets remain unsold. Upper*
classmen are taking an unusual in-
terest in the Cotillion this year
and at present 178 orders have
been received fox* tickets. Stanley
Walsh, . chairman of the finance
committee, urged all . Sophomores
to secure their tickets before Fri-
day because of the great demand
for them by upper classmen.
Maurice McNulty, chairman of
the-- Music ^-committee,has-- an-
nounced that Benson’s Collegian
orchestra of Chicago has been en-
gaged fox* the occasion. Music for
the Tea Dance, which will be held
during the hours from ,4 to • 6 on
the afternoon of the day of the
Cotillion, will be furnished . by
Harry Denny’s orchestra.
Indication Are Thai Some Clubs
Are Saving Votes for Final Dash;
Ballots Open to Investigation.
Ballots are piling up thick and
fast in the DAILY’S Best-Organi-
zation contest. Today’s resulty are
approximately similar to Tuesday’s;
the same clubs are leading in both
the Home and Campus classes, and
the three or four leaders in each
class have counted so many votes
in the last few days that the rank
and file clubs stand but little chance,
apparently, of overtaking them. ..
There are indications, however,
that certain clubs. have gathered
many votes together and are hold-
ing them out until the last moment.
Attention is called to the fact
that if the regular ballots printed:
in the DAILY are not available one
may substitute a ballot of his own,
provided it conforms to the form of
the ballot printed inthe DAILY.
Again we call upon the student
body to remember the strict pur-
pose of the DAILY in instituting
this contest—namely, .to allow stu-
dent opinion, conscientiously ex- . *
pressed, to pick out the two or-
ganizations in the : two classes
which have in the past FIRST,-AC-
COMPLISHED THE MOST FOR '
NOTRE DAME, AND SECONDLY,
HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THE
MOST FOR THEIR MEMBERS.
The 'DAILY will see that these
clubs are rewarded with two of
the handsomest loving cups to be
had in the city.
The DAILY has examined the
charges against certain organiza-
tions, 'and. has found no" practice- "
yet used to be illegitimate. So far
there have been no violations-..of
the voting rules; all ballots, fur-
thermore, are being. filed away by
the .Contest Editors, and are open
to public inspection at any time.
No tabulation of ballots was
possible'before press time.
Scholarship Club Has
Best Dance of Year
The Scholarship club held the
biggest and best dance of the pres-
ent year at the Palais Ro yale last
Tuesday evening where over three
hundred couples were in attend-
ance.
The spacious floor of the Palais
Royale and the extra hour of danc-
ing—the hours being from 8 to 12
;—served to attract ■ the . unusual
number.- Music was furnished by
the Palais Royale orchestra. Prob-
ably all of the succeeding Scholar-
ship dances will be held in the
Palais Royale where better facili-
ties can be secured for handling
larger crowds.
A.I.E.E. to Hear Noted
Graduate Engineer
Mr. Fred L. Baer, assistant chief
engineer of the Automatic Electric
Company of Chicago, will give'an
illustrated talk on “Automatic Te-
lephony” to the members of the
Notre Dame chapter of A. I. E. E., .
in the South room- of the library
Friday evening at 8 o’clock.
Mr. Baer is an alumnus of Notre'
Dame, having graduated from the
Electrical Engineering course in
1903. During his college years he
became actively interested in auto-
matic telephony to the extent that •,
he spent a number of .his school
vacations at the factory of the Au-
tomatic Electric Company.
Irish Terrier Mascot Is Presented
to Rockne By Toledo N. D. Club,
The bucking Army “mule” and
the snarling Princeton “tiger” will
have to.be ever on the alert next
fall when the new three months old
Fighting. Irish mascot, an Irish ter-
rier, accompanies the team on its
eastern invasion. ’ In fact, if the
Rockmen are as successful against
Army .and Princeton this coming
season as they were the past, the
Irish Mascot will have plenty, to
“bark” about.
It was through the Toledo club
and Edward Lynch, a prominent
alumnus of the club who was also
a varsity football center in 1909,
thatt he Irish Mascot wps secured
and presented yesterday afternoon
to Rockne.
Coach Rockne has given Max
Houser full charge of the recently
acquired pet and has instructed
Max to see* to it that the Mascot
leads anything but a “dogs life”
around the gym, which is to be its
future home.
The mascot’s pedigree reveals
that his ancestors boasted of two
international ' championships, and
seven national championships; and
a closer investigation of his gene-"
ology shows that he is a direct de-
scendent from Jack of Penwood,
Nora W, Dame Fortune of Pen-
; wood, Tipperary Tyke, Tapton
Belle, Irish Ragtime, Firnardy Lass,
and Killashandra Mag. He came
from the O. I .C. Kennels of Toledo,
operated by James O’Reilly. <
The formal presentation. of. the
mascot to Rockne and the Notre
Dame Athletic Association Mil be
made by “Pink” O’Boyle, president
of the Toledo club, Friday evening
at the basketball game with , the
Michigan Aggies, on the “Y” floor.
In the meantime Rockne suggests
that the students begin to think of
some appropriate name for the ter-
rier. In this connection the DAILY
believes that a contest of some
kind would be very suitable fox*
the purpose, and it will have some
announcements to make regarding
it in the next issue."

Much thought has been expended
on advertising.. Some of it is sug-
gestive. All of it aims to be. The
proffered suggestion is not to set
about thinking very seriously about
anything, but rather to make haste
to buy something. But for those
who have the habit of reflecting—
and it is not a bad habit—advertis-
ing slogans may become veritable
keystones of thought.
—o—
One such slogan frequently
comes,to mind. It might well serve
as a motto to be printed in guilded
letters and- hung over the desks of
us college students. If heeded it
would save much remorse. Pro-
crastination is “the badge of all our
tribe.” It might better still be in-
scribed bn the confessionals of our
churches. . Death-bed conversions,
we have, heard,, are about as effica-
cious as a court-plaster on a-wood-
en leg. It would not be out of
place anywhere except on a grave-
stone. It reads: “Eventually,
why not'now?” A sack of Pills-
bury’s flour completes the adver-
tisement.
two splendid virtues—you will
soon come to recognize the best.
And then, when it has curried your
favor by such flattering inunen-
does, it entraps you in the snare of
potential inconsistency by pretend-
ing to believe that you at least
could 'never "choose anything else
while knowing the best.
, — o—
But there, it sems to us, the phil-
osophy of the phrase runs amuck.’
For, as we know human nature,
that is precisely what is taking
place every day. We do set aside
what we . know to be better and
best, and choose what is less good,
and sometimes with the sangfroid
with, which we might purchase an
Ingersoll rather than a South Bend
watch. We possess freedom of will,
and we love to display it. We pos-
sess poor judgment and are not

A MELTING POT
Can a college be made a successful melting pot?
Dr. George L. Collie, dean of Beloit College, and a widely-known
z anthropologist, thinks that it can. At least he has made the proposal
"to the members of the Board of College Trustees that the. Wisconsin
school be selected as an institution for bringing together representa-
tives, of all the races in the world in an attempt to effect racial under-
standing which would make for world peace.
■As proposed by Dr. Collie the plan would bring to- Beloit College
’ selected students from all the' races and sub-divisions of races. It
would constitute an ethnological laboratory with the student personnel
as follows: ' .
■ Americans, 40 per cent; Europeans, 20 per cent; Asiatics, 20 per
cent; South Americans, 10 per cent; and Africans, 10 per cent. -
There is, of course, nothing novel in the idea of foreign students
being educated at American schools. Notre Dame has welcomed many
students from other lands. Nearly every state university has its quota
of non-American. students, who hope to prepare themselves for greater
service in their native-lands. , To this extent the sharing of educa-
• tional opportunities with the foreign student is no doubt ..beneficial,
’ . But it is'difficult to see how any group in the student personnel
as proposed by Ur. Collie could derive much benefit from being-put in
contact with so many and such diverse races. Far from resulting-in
the hoped-for racial understanding, the proposed commingling of races
would emphasize national differences and would rekindle jealousies.
"	■ After al? the'atmosphere-of* university life is aii essential part of
education, but one hesitates to imagine the atmosphere that would be
found in the proposed international college. Unity of spirit and pur-
pose is likewise needed to insure the success of-an institution of learn-
ing; but this element could not even be hoped for among so many
racial representatives.
Fortunately Dr. Collie’s plan is merely a proposal and one which
is not very likely to be carried into effect. Yet there are many who
may regard it as . a most interesting experiment. It might indeed be
such an experiment; but the possible benefits of it can hardly compen-
sate for its cost, to say nothing of its possible evils.
Racial understanding, when it does come, will be effected,through
the love'of God being taught to all men in their respective countries'and
not through algebra being taught to all men in a single university.
If you can’t dance don’t criticise the orchestra.
—o—	- .	■
That much is depicted. The rest
1 is left for you to surmise. A pro-
fessional advertiser could possibly
tell you just why, wherein and
wherefore nothing more is added.
He could distinguish for you. all the
psychological under-currents that
are set going by that terse phrase,
and that send progressive house-
wives to the phone with a prompt
order for 50 pounds of the product.
He could make a forecast of the
cross-currents that would inevitab-
ly result were anything else added,
and thus promptly present you. with
an estimate of the amount of trade
certain thereby to be lost. He
could do this, perhaps. We can-
not. . And so we can only go on
jotting down for you the thoughts
which the phrase does stir up in us.
—°~
The epithet, pleases because it is
^complimentary. The “eventually”
suavely suggests that you are'pro-
gressing toward better-judgment in
your selection of flour, that by be-
ing courageous and patient—
so many ways, it seems altogether’
probable that not even, such clever
advertising will ever give Pillsbury
a monopoly on flour.
—o—
' But what has flour to do with
philosophy? A learned scientist
once objected to this advertisement
on theological grounds. He con-
tended that one could not soberly
reason J “Eventually I shall die;
why not now?” And so he main-
tained, by a sort of a pari argu-
ment, one could not prudently com-
mit himself to the resolution:
“Eventually I shall buy Pillsbury’s,
why not now?” For just as to die
now because death will come even-
tually, would be flying in the face
of Providence, so to buy the costli-
est flour now because eventually I
may be able 'to do . so is flying in
the face of prudence, which is a
sort of human participation in
Providence. Here is a case of the-
ology versus the billboards.
—o—-
To conclude. The moral of the
slogan is this: “Deliberando saepe
p’erit qccasio.” . It is so plain that
he'who runs' may read. ‘ Therefore
seize opportunity by the forelock,
or, if you wish, seize the bull by
the horns.' .	:

Some Inside Dope on Our Famous French
Namesake, The Cathedral of Notre Dame
Many interesting and little known
- facts about the romantic history, of
- -the - ancient Cathedral of' Notre
Dame were brought to light during
the exhaustive research .work con-
ducted as a prelude to the filming
of Victor Hugo’s classic “The
.Hunchback of Notre Dame.”
One of the'most interesting of
these legends is concerned with the
monarch Prudentius. Notre Dame
stands on - the site of -the ’ oldest
basilica of the capital, constructed
- even before the Cathedral of Sairite
.- Etienne ‘ Martyr, which waL- long
considered to be the most ancient.
Excavations made under the pres-
ent cathedral and on the Place de
Parvis Notre Dame, especially those
of 1847, confirmed this fact.
The original; edifice consecrated
to Notre Dame was built , by Pru-
.. dentius/ and . was a basilica with-
"out a transept, the roof being sus-
tained by . columns of marble and
pavements7 decorated with mosaics.
At the end of the sixth century,
the both churches were standing so
near each other that they almost
touched.' The basilica of Sainte
Pierre and Saint Paul, built by Clo-
via, was on- the summit of the hill
on the slopes of which stood, the
Palais des Thermes. ;
. The legend relates that Pruden-
tius selected the site, measured the
ground to be devoted to the church
by hurling his .francisque, or dou-
ble-headed battle axe to the utmost
point his strength permitted. He
did not live'; to see it completed,
but the Work was finished -by his
widow, Clotilda. ; Hr was Maurice
de Saully, Bishop of Paris, who'in
1163 demolished £he ancient bas-
cilia .arid laid the first stone of the
present structure. Pope Alexan-
der III presided at the ceremony.
THE INK WELL

Mood
There are wild winds stirring to-
night on the hill,
Keeping time with the breaths of a
man.
There are gray clouds chasing the
light from the skies, -
Mocking eyes that peer and scan.
There are cold snows raging tonight
on the hill;	-
And a heart that is filled with de-
. spair.
There are fierce blasts chilling river
and rill,
Shrieking scorn at a prayer.
There are soft winds kissing1 flowers
on the hill.
And tears in the valley below.
There are pensive notes from the
whip-poor-will,
Telling a story of woe.
PARSONS’ -PLEASURE. By Christopher
1923. $1.75. -	'	• :
-Morley. New York: George H. Doran,
The. reader who picks up a new
book by Christopher Morley can
feel certain of experiencing certain
reaction with almost mathematical
accuracy. He knows that he ..will
not be bored, but, on the contrary,
wilLbe considerably amused. He
will also undoubtedly discover
something that will move him;
“Parsons’ Pleasure,” Morley’s lat-
est venture, we are happy to report,
runs more than true to. form. ,It
contains ■within its- attractive cov-
ers some really delightful poetry
blended with an engaging' Quaker
idealism.'
The poem which gives the book
its title, “Parsons’' Pleasure”
(which it may be-noted is a bath-
ing pool near New College, Ox-
ford) is . a really moving piece of
■'••se. It might be very adequately
described as recipe ' for making
poets..
“Save he has quickened and been
. moved
By that irrational agonizing fit
That teaches him to love all life,
and honour it-— •
Dreadful: tenderness that goes
deep, deep,
Like the downward gaze upon a
child asleep—
This, if he does not know it,
He is not poet:
He'is not poet, for he has not

loved.”
Among the most engaging things
in the volume are some little bur-
lesques on Shakespeare. Mr. Mor-,
ley has thoughtfully provided “As
You Like It” and “The Tempest”
with a few additional scenes. The.
homour. is fine and there., is some
pretty verse. The skill with which
he has caught these peculiarities of
Shakespeare' which can be imi-
tated is another feather in the au-
thor’s cap. Mr. Morley has suc-
ceeded in casting his own thought
in the - ancient' idiom and has pro-
duced swiftness and imagination in
these quaint things,
To end this brief notice of a
charming book, let us turn our
glance from what Mr. Morley does
not only fairly to what he does ex-
traordinarily well. “Translations
from the Chinese” compose a sec-
tion of the book to which all lovers
of Mr. Morley will turn first: .
“Gold is real money;
Bills-are not. -	- ----
Yet, in nine shops out of ten,
If you offer’a gold piece
They are vaguely disturbed:
They would prefer .the familiar
greenback
And anxiously suspect '
They are being diddled.
Observe the fable,
You literary men.”.
It is a distinct pleasure to come
upon a book like “Parsons^ Pleas-
ure.” Neither as great or immor-
tal do we wish to term it, but as
something salty and exceedingly
well balanced.

. The Pathe News is good!
If “White Tiger,” Priscilla Dean’s
latest starring vehicle, were in-
' tended to be a comedy, we might
be able to say the same thing of it.
But unfortunately for Miss Dean
and the supporting cast, most of
whom die with their"boots on in a
brave endeavor to make something
out of the picture, this production
is intended to be a serious drama
of the underworld. Its reason, for
being, as far as we were able to
discover, is to point out to children
the wages • ofl.scrime; if such is its
purpose, . “White Tiger” attains
some measure of success, for the
picture itself might be classified as
a misdemeanor.
We have no quarrel with Pris-
cilla’ Dean. x If she is ever given
the opportunity, she may. show
some evidences of the histrionic
ability which we believe she pos-
sesses. She has not been given
such an opportunity in “White
Tiger,” in which she is cast as the
pretty - pickpocket who steals the
hearts of men as, well as their
purses , (a character that we do not
believe was intended to be an alle-
gorical representation of the mod-
ern ’girl). It has been suggested
by an admirer of Priscilla that she
be cast in -her next production as
Queen Elizabeth; if the suggestion
is adopted, she may find her many
experiences in these crook parts in-
valuable.— E. L.

I just finished having the best

that isn’t true, I haven’t finished
^.laughing. yet._and; I don’t .think^1
will for some time. It is seldom in
. the.course of human events that
one sees a picture as funny as “Lit-
tle Johnny Jones.” Exclusive per-
haps of Harold Lloyd in his famous
. “Safety Last,” I never saw a movie
to compete with this one. The
story is crammed with comical sit-
uations.. There are numerous-places
where the action is highly dramatic,
others where the picture moves
along at break-neck speed. People
rise unconsciously from their seats
and crush their hats in their hands.
The fact was so uppermost in' my
mind that I have neglected to men-
tion'that the greatest reason for
all the fun is Johnny Hines, who
plays the lead. As usual he has a
“knockout” of a girL playing op-
posite him: an incentive, as it were.
Horse races are my hobby (no pun
intended). Johnny is a jockey who
rides one of the prettiest horses I
ever laid my eyes on. The horse’s
name' is “Yankee Doodle,” and
“Yankee Doodle” wins the English
derby: n’uf said. There was some
real racing in the picture, too,; and
dirty work- and all that goes to
make a race exciting. The jockey
bet all his money on his own horse
and all that sort of thing.. And, he
won. Well, I saw the picture twice

Find Elusive Sun Dial
There is a mysterious sun - dial
on the University campus.
Professor George N. Shuster says
so himself.
The existence of the sun dial,
therefore, cannot be questioned.
But it has never bden seen—at
least by any one except Professor
Shuster.
The sun dial mystery is four years
old. It began when Professor
Shuster told his classes when talk-
ing about Journalism, that they
lacked the faculty of keen obser-
vation. . .And he proved it; proved
it by sending thjbm out to find
Notre Dame’s sun dial. No one
found it. .
That was. four years ago. Since
then, the affair has remained. a
mystery, although we are assured
that the sun dial is right, under the
collective noses of the student
body.
In .a time when contests are in
vogue, it should be quite proper to
launch one .more.
Who will be the first to discover
the sun dial?
Appetites of University Boilers Demand
Thirty-five Tons of Coal a Day
Thirty-five tons of coal may pro-
vide the average - family with fuel
for five years, or it may 'comprise
the entire stock of a coal merchant,
but to the boilers maintained at
the central heat plant of the Uni-
versity, it supplies the needs of Kbut
one day.	.
Twenty-six buildings are supplied
with heat from this source, conse-
quently the problem of providing
warmth is a large one. The main
factors.in the production of heat
are the seven boilers which com-
pose the boiler plant. Three of
theseare-of7-the -Kroeschell water
tube, type rated at 250 H. P., and
designed, for 160 pounds pressure.
Being of the latest type, having
been installed only several' months
ago, they are equipped with the
Laclede-Christy chain grate stokers.
In addition to being of the natural
draft type, they/permit the use of
screening instead of the prepared
size of coal; which proves to be of
great economic benefit. The re-
maining four, which are of the fire
tube type, rated at 150 H. P. and
designed for 133 pounds pressure,
are equipped with shaking grates.
During the heating season, from
four to five boilers are kept in use
to supply steam to the laundry and
kitchen; One boiler, at least, is
operated throughout the year, how-
ever. • .
To guard against the weather,
coal bins have been constructed
which have a capacity of 4,000 tons.
The coal is carried from the car
to the bins by means of a conveyor
which employs the monorail sys-
tem, and which was installed by
the Godfrey Conveyor Company,'of

Editor of The DAILY.:
We would like to submit the fol-
lowing in reply to the comments of
one “Endymion”:
Oh, Endymion, beautiful youth
and lover of the goddess of moon-
light nights and starlit skies, why
does your little heart ache so? We
pray for you Endymion, dear child,
do not allow you etymological wor-
ries, so sincere and heartfelt, to
bring you to a state of nervosity.
We admit with you that “cake-
eater” may be classed as-an am-
bigious term, but. surely the mean-
ing which Notre Dame men at-
tribute to the term can not be mis-
judged. The really true Notre
Dame man is the one who can
stand up and1 fight like a man for
a principle or an ideal; the man
who knows right from wrong and
will stake his hide to defend the
right; the man with ideals which
soar . aloft and with" manhood
enough to plug for their attain-
ment. He may dance; he may dress
welt and neatly; he may enjoy the
company of young ladies; those are
15 hours were required to unload
a car, but with the. installation of
the conveyor, three cars are emp-
tied in this time.
-With two general service pumps
of the. Worthington Underwriter
type, each rated at 750 gallons-a
minute, the University is supplied
with water. Only one pump op-
erates at a time, however, the other
being used only in case of an
emergency, such as fire. Inciden-
tally, the maximum amount of water
required for various uses is but
400 gallons a minute.
Notre Dame~may be said to pos-
sess a very efficient heating plant
and with its present equipment is
apparently able to cope with any
conditions. The pumping plant,
tod, is in good condition—nothing
but the lake could interfere with its
efficiency.
Students whose desires turn to
indoor pastimes, whether basket-
ball dr Mah Jongg, during the win-
ter squalls, need have no fears re-
garding lack of heat or scarcity of
water. '	"

matters of personal liking. But if
the young man cares more for
dancing, more for the ladies, more
for the joys than for the honest ef-
fort and work of life, and if he
has not the guts to fight -his way,
and to hold ground against those
who would belittle womanhood and
bring manhood to the level of the
lolly-pop, lounge lizzard, then in-
deed that sort may well be called
a “cake-eater.”'
A man may wear corduroys, hob
nails, and profusely .expectorate
Mail Pouch, and still be a “cake-
eater.”’ He may wear' a tuxedo to
every, evening, meal, dress accord-
ing to the latest Vanity Fair styles,
and at the same time be an honest-
to-God man. A sissy is born and
reared a sissy or he acquires that
defect from environment, and his
ailment is one of the heart; the
veneer of his make-up cannot
change his innate tendencies. There
is such a thing as a sissy,- and the
word is merely - a synonym for
“cake-eater,” “lolly-pop,” “lounge
lizard,” and “sheik”; they are one
and the same. You know the man
and we know him.
Endymion, 'flower of youth and
lover whose contenance the goddess'
of moonbeams so fondly carresses,
fear not that we envy you - your
tuxedo; we do not. Do not think
that we' would cause your dainty
feet the discomfort of rough and
obnoxious hod-nails, or your
nymph-like form the chafing sensa-
tion of smelly corduroys. And
neither would we cause you chronic
gastritis by demanding of you that
you learn the filthy habit of the
use of tobacco. Such disgusting
things would be repugnant to one
who believes himself so charming
as to feel that he so closely resem-
bles the Greek youth Endymion.
But Endymion be a man, sink
deeper than the veneer of culture,
get to the heart of manhood, and
there you will find the Eichenlaubs,
Dave Hayes, Pete Vaughns, Buck
Shaws, and the rest of the men
who have made Notre Dame a
school of fame. In them you will find
men of culture, men of grace, and
“men girt for combat, men of grit,
clear to the core:”- Take their
graces alone and you have a “cake-
eater”; take alone their fight and
pluck and you have a “rough-
neck.” A Notre Dame man should,
be • a homogeneous combination of
the two.1
We may not have answered .your
questions, Endymion, but -realize
“that. we have tried, and perhaps
we have not the knowledge, and per-
haps we have not the strength,”

IRISH TO MEET
NORTHWESTERN
Purple Men Will Open Track Season
Here Saturday; Rockne Has
Many New Men on List.
Coach Rockne’s Notre Danie
tracksters will be seen, in action
for the first time this season when
Captain Paul Kennedy and a large
coterie of cinder artists will en-
. gage the Northwestern outfit in a
dual meet in the Notre Dame gym
next Saturday,' January 26.
The Purple squad having met its
first opposition last week in Chi-
cago when it took on the Maroons,
been following a long sertn-
have
uous series of practice1 sessions and
will be in splendid condition, for
the season opener at Notre Dame.
Coach Rockne selected his entries
for the Purple meet in the. trials
held last Saturday in the local gym.
Some very good results can be pre-
dicted from the showing made by
the runners in the first test, al-
though they are still in early sea-
son form.
With Layden, Barr, McTiernan
and Livergood in the 40-yard dash,
thfi Irish sprint team is in very
.-good. condition and can boast of
plenty of speed. Johnny Johnson
copped the final heat in the 40-yard
high hurdles with Casey, .Walsh and
Ross finishing next in order. Both
Walsh and Casey are lettermen
from last year, and are slated for
x some winning point work. Rockne
. has also found some: very good ma-
terial in Johnson and Ross, who will
give the lettermen a- close run in
the tall timber event.
Out of a field of seven quarter-
milers, the Irish mentor found a
trio composed of W. Eaton, -Ham-
ling and McTiernan that is expected
to show greater form during the
coming season than last year. - An-
other man is yet to be added to
make up the quartet. Hamling and
' * McTiernan turned in a quarter
Saturday, in :54 flat. Cox, the di-
minutive ’ half-mile flash whb won
his event. iri'-2:03. in -a- sensational-
finish at the Illinois meet last year,
registered a win in the 880-yard
• run, crossing the' finish in 2:05.

THE RUB DOWN
By TOM COMAN
While certain schools in, the
country are expressing the,fear that
$he co-eds of the institutions are
detrimental to the best athletic
standings, the Monogram club at
Ohio State is also facing a difficulty
with the co-eds. Hoge Work-
man, president of the varsity
“O” association, is (endeavoring to
prevent the awarding of the var-
sity block “O” to po-eds at Ohio
State who have earned a mono-
gram in swimming and several oth-
er sports on the women’s athletic
card. Workman contends that the
plain round “O”- should be given to
the co-eds instead of the block “O”
which ife the football, monogram
and carries with it a certain hon-
or attained only by the football
man at Ohio State. The plain “0”
is the award for baseball, ba’sket-
ball and track.
Loyalty and admiration for a man
who had given his best to the game
was the direct cause of the Miske

testimonial boxing program giVen
in St. Paul a few nights ago. The
proceeds of the affair, which topped
the $11,000 mark, were turned over
to the widow and children of the
man who possessed two hearts, one
of courage which manifested itself
in every ring encounter and the
other for his family.
Miske’s love for his family
brought him to his death, so, we are
told by men who knew him' inti-
mately. He had earned quite a for-
tune in boxing but misfortune in
a business venture wiped it out, anil
Miske, suffering with Brights dis-
ease and knowing well that a few
more punches would mean the final
count, re-entered the roped arena
to gather up a little more money
for those whom he would leave in
this world.	5
Miske died, his life’s fondest.hope
shattered, but he died a Catholic
and the sporting life of St. Paul
and other cities have not forgotten
the man who gave his best.
