YTfE CLASS OFI927 _
' Contemporary with the open season for dramatic critics, the:
cquinoxial storms, the ripening of the fair fruit of the vine—the fruit
of the tomato vine, to be explicit—we have in these wistful autumn;
days the annual immigration of freshmen; In contrast with the scarlet;
harvest of the vine, however, the frosh is green-and .hard, green gold;
.if you will—but not the kind whose verdure, colors Christmas jewelry.;
With shining countenance, exuding the debonair nonchalance of;
youth, his spirit, eager for the seed of knowledge, soars in its quest fori
wisdom. But, to the point— t- —-
In: these four years the eager young man‘will mold his ideals, ease;
into his lifework, and adapt himself to the estate of manhood. He will:
carve his. character and by. that carving his life is triumph or decay.-
Any flaw that 'develops in\himl will here develop and-be certain to mari
the man through , his. years. . One false stroke will irretrievably damage:
. ;him, a man arrived at the most important period of life.	. -	;
< But these things cannot be known, except in retroprospect. The;
yearling steps , blithely down the days, completely oblivious , to .all but’
the exhilarating ease of_ existence. ' Nor is it good to be too serious at
this .age. Just enough seriousness; to be sensible, just enough gaiety
to enjoy life at a period when it Js most full, of enjoyment—that, is
the proper menu. . -	-	■	;	-	-
THE TEAM AND TRADITION
Tlie" football .'teams?that have 7maBe?Nbtre7Dame famous in atli-; I
. letics are known to be teams' that?fight. Old students recall many
games won by last -minute scores because the Irish never gave, up the
• fight.1 Such games are-memories to rail of us. . " <	' .
One of _the reasons that glorious victories?have been won in the
face of seemingly certain defeats is the spirit’ of a fighting; student .
body. Traditional Notre Dame teams have never been found wanting.
But now we are beginning, a new year. Coach Rockne has arranged
the most~difficult schedule in our history. He also has assembled what
is perhaps the best array of talent that has ever tread Car tied field?
But even though the team of 1923 seems to be destined to rival
that of71913, undefeated though they played the very strongest, the
1923 team cannot be a' success unless backed by the unflagging support
of every Notre Dame man. -	-	7	' .	.
Students do not remain in. their room's, in .the library, in the labora-
tory, nor do they spend an afternoon in town, when the Irish play on
Cartier field. Such things are done at:some schools; but not at Notre
’ Dame. ’	? ’	......■	;
The largest number of students that ever attended ,Notre DameYs
, here this year. The spirit of previous years ’must be infused- into the
men who are here for the first time. Every man must feel it. is his
personal duty to back .the .team whole-heartedly and always. He must
. . see that another year of glorious tradition is added to the history of a
united Notre-Dame^ - '	.	7 -	7

From Off Stage
I If you enjoy a combination of
good mystery and clever comedy,
you. will like “Strangers of the
Night,” this week’s attraction at the
Orpheum. It is an adaption, and a
Very good one, of the stage success,
<kCaptain Applejack,” in which Wal-
lace Eddinger and Mary Nash
starred.
‘ The cast 'included Matt Moore
and Ambrose Applejohn, Enid Ben-
nett as Poppy Faire, Robert McKim
as the very efficient villian, and Bar-
bara LaMarr as an equally efficient
vamp. Matt Moore, who can read-
ily turn his hand to any role given
him, gives one of the best perform-
ances of his career, both as the
lethargic Ambrose, and as the adven-
turous Captain Apple jack. The
remainder of the cast is admirably
selected, the honors going, perhaps,
to Enid Bennett, who showed
flashes of more than ordinary
ability. ■	.
; It was directed by Fred Niblo, a
man of brains and imagination, who
recently began making independent
productions. If they are all on a
par with “Captain Applejack,” the
public will have no quarrel with
him; '	,
At the Blackstone, Lois Wilson
and Richard Dix appear in Zane
. Gray’s popular novel, “To the Last
Man.” If it were only for the fact
that Frank’Campeau, Noah Beery,
and Robert ’Edeson are in the cast,
the picture would be worth seeing.
The book, from which the pictureis
derived, is a historical novel dealing,
with the Northwest.. ”	.......

w New York; \ $2.00.	'
“A- Son at the Front”' is, as. may

John Campton is a man who, be-,
/cause _ of his 7 separation from his

to become acquainted with his son
who has grown to manhood. In the
•summer of 1914 George visits his

Fortune’s Fool, by Rafael Sebatini.
Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston and
New York. $2.00? '	.
Rafael Sabatini, creator of
Scaramouche and of Captain Blood,
the. weaver of colorful romances of
by-gone days, has produced another
novel, “Fortune’s Fool,” which
promises to add greatly to his pop-
ularity, although it has neither the
expert character portrayal nor. the
excellent description found in his
earlier successes.
It is an interesting story of the
time of, Charles II which concerns
one Randal Holies', the second of
that name, a former colonel in the
Parliamentary Army, whose father
had been, partly responsible for the.
death of Charles I. These unfortu-
nate circumstances make it impos-
sible for him to obtain a commis-
sion in the - Royalist forces, despite
the friendship of the powerful Dulce
of Albemarle. . As a last resort,
Holies, in his straightened condi-
tion, agrees to abduct a popular
actress with whom the Duke 'of
Buckingham has become enamored.
After the abduction he repents, and,
to redeem himself for his dishon-
orable act, endeavors to rescue her.
The remainder of . the story in which
Hoiles regains his honor and be-
comes fortune’s favorite .is written
in Sabatini’s best fashion.—J. S. B.
