INTERHALL RELAYS
BREAK RECORDS
Sophomore- Defeats. Brownson,
Equalling Record of Tuesday;
Track Card Announced.
The Interhall relays moved to-
wards their close . Thursday when'
the fast Sophomore sextet defeated
the Brownsoniter in a hotly con-
tested race, equalling the record of j
1:37 flat which the Carroll haliers
created last Tuesday. Walsh hall
won over the Day-dogs in the only
contest run off Thursday, several
others having been postponed.
The postponed races will be held
at a later date, because. of the
muddy condition of the track. ‘
Each week brings forth improve-
ment of nearly every team and
the gym record.of 1:36 2-5 is lia-
ble to be shattered ; before the
championship; . is .awarded. The
winning hall relay: team, will be
awarded a cup donated by .Bill the
barber. .
The next scheduled races, after
those which were postponed until
Monday,' will be held Tuesday,
when the following teams
[meet:	■ '	.	•
[ Badin and Freshman.
.Walsh and Brownson.
Day and Sorin. ..
Sophomore and Carroll.
Corby and Cadillac. •
. An addition to the 1924
will
_ sport
card at the University will be the
opening of the regular- Interhall
track season with the staging of
the first annual meet, March 13,
which will be the final to the two
preliminaries scheduled to be run
off February 28 and March 6.
The appearance of the interhall
runners 'on the 'local track- this- win-
ter will probably be the “signal for
the addition of some new material
to the varsity ranks. Hardly a year
passes but what the staging of the
interhall meets' does not bring to
I light a set of new trackmen who
were unaware of their cinder path
ability • until they entered the hall
competition. The • preliminaries
this year, as well as the finals, will
afford an invaluable opportunity
for large numbers of the men on
the campus who are dubious of
their track ability, to face the
starter’s gun. The events for both
preliminary trials will start prompt-
ly at 7:30 in the evening. The

Mr. Grundy Inspires New Publication;
“Freshman Tattler ” Written by The Ghost
A -• *	* ••
Another publication^ if it may be
called such, has appeared on the
campus under the name of the
Freshman Tattler. It is creating
quite a bit of amusement, espe-
cially since its editor is. anonymous
and signs himself “The; Ghost.”
But this does not give much clue
to his identity. Is it possible that
the spirits have taken up their
abode in Freshman, hall? At any
rate the Tattler gives a good deal
of inside dope on many of the
Frosh, such as a few litle private
love affairs, etc. It has not yet
been discovered where the myster-
। ious author gets his information,
[ but he evidently has a good system
of scouts who round up the news.
The sheet which has now been run-
ning for about a. week contains
everything from the weather to a
lost and found column. The prin-
cipal feature, however, is the per-
sonalnews. On a whole the Tattler
may be taken as a humorous pub-
lication. Whether this sheet will
rival Mr. Grundy in its mysterious
source depends on how long it will
survive. The Tattler is-placed on
the bulletin board in Freshman hall
at the disposal of all those who
wish to imbibe its contents.

; Rockmen in Illinois Track Meet
’ Next Saturday; Luke Walsh
Will Be on Team.
The only week-end attraction on
the Notre Dame sport program will
1 be the annual Blue and Gold meet
to be run off in the local gym this
afternoon at 3 o’clock.
The meet should be a valuable
conditioner for the varsity squad
which will journey to Urbana to
meet the crack Illinois team next
Saturday. The Irish squad will face
■ some very severe competition on
the Urbana track, and the wearers
of the Blue and Gold will have to
show their wares in order to over-
come the fast stepping competition
that will be provided by the. Fight-
ing Ulini.
The meet this afternoon will be
of ‘great; interest in. more than one
J^ay,“-^particularlyin . the zest ; of
rivalry that is certain to be brought
out by the two teams, each boast
ihg of members of the regular var-
sity crew as well as freshmen.
Some .brilliant running will be
seen in the dashes, quarter mile,
mile, and two mile runs, in which
Barr and Layden, Kennedy and
Judge will probably be the fea-
tures. Luke iWalsh, Notre Dame’s
great relay man will be seen in ac-
tion in the practice meet this aft-
ernoon for the first time this year.
Adam Walsh will undoubtedly, get
some very -close running in both
the low and high hurdles from the
Tegular varsity men and from Bar-
ron and Wynn of the yearling
squad.
The pole vault should be fea-
tured, by the work of Hammill j who
is steadily approaching the 12-foot
mark. Carey, and Harrington are
in the same event and are able to
top the.bar at a mark oyer 11 feet.
The shot put will * also, see some
close competition for the varsity
men from the Frosh entrants, Bo-
land and Mayer.
" The high jump, which is still the
weakest event on the program, will
bring out the work of 7 Fry,' the
freshman star, and Johnson,, who
took second place in the Northwest-
ern meet.
Looking over the line-up of the
teams, we might say that the Gold
will take the meet with the Blue a
very -close second.-. But conditions
might be just the reverse. The
winner, i however, will not have a
walk-away by any means. " .
The entrants:

Enright and Crowe Star; Notre
Dame to Meet Adrian College
Tuesday Night,
The Irish basketeers* team proved
their worth in a most striking man-
ner when, they defeated the fast
Wabagji five, 23-16, on the Craw-
fordsville floor last Wednesday
night.
The Blue and Gold quintet got
off to a bad start but found its
stride before the end of the first
period and grabbed a, fair lead.
Both teams returned on equal fight-
ing terms for the second half and
the Little Giants put up a stout
fight to tie the' score at ten all.
Clem Crowe stepped into the lime-
light at this point and began to
sink the. leather with remarkable
accuracy. Enright also aided the
Irish forward in piling up the
[points and snatching the game
from the fire rather than have a
duplicate of the Indiana game
happen.	-
The Notre Dame five have found
themselves in the best of playing
condition three times within the
past ten days on foreign-floors and
should return ’ home to face the
Adrian five next Tuesday in high-
stepping fashion.
The proteges of Keogan brought
their eagle eye to Concordia last
Saturday and rolled up _ 38 points
as their share of the spoils. The
following Tuesday night found
them at Bloomington and facing
one of the cleverest basketball
teams in . the conference. The
score tells the story much better
than words because Indiana , won
the game by a margin of one point.
Against-the- Little* Giants the next -z
night, the Irish crew was still hit-
ting the fast pace they had set the
evening previous and the Wabash
quintet was given the full force" of
their fighting game. .
The Notre Dame quintet will
meet the Adrian college five on the
“Y” court next Tuesday night. <

It is said that Democritus always
laughed when he thought of man’s
life ■. on .earth; • Heraclitus wept.
Both were Greek philosophers, and,
in this matter, both were wrong.
For since life is neither a joke nor
a catastrophe, neither a vaudeville
nor a funeral, no one has a right
constantly either to act the buffoon
or to elevate. mourning into, an
avocation. The history of thought!
is not the history of error, nor is
the history of human institutions
the history of blunders. Cynicism'
means dog-like. It should be left
to the dogs. .	•

1	WISE FOOLS
£ .v.Wlleri. a man arrives at the stage of intellectual growth called
youth, he is a vague idealist, a wise fool. According to him all is
: wrong- in 1 he university and the universe, and the faculty and mankind
i.arc-hopelessly blind to what are to him evident panaceas.
The young Shelley suggested universal atheism as a cure for the
world’s, ills, and was promptly kicked out of Oxford. The 1915 Dome
ridiculed the idea of locating the Library so far off the campus. “It
is rumored that we are to have a new library, and that same will be hid
behind Old College,” they said. They kicked further. “The pep of
past generations of students seems to be dying of. inanition. ......
Red tape has in no wise diminished or abated.” Etc., etc. A recent
writer to the DAILY said that the Library was bogus. Another youth,
zealous for the combat that forms real opinions, followed with.a letter
that said the Notre Dame Library was superior to most others, that
its system and help deserved many congratulatory slaps on the upper
spinal cord; Wrote Belloc:	'	.
: .	“ ‘Can this be Oxford? . This the place’ .	.
.	: (He: cries,) ‘of which my father said ,	i: :
The tutoring was a damned disgrace,
The creed a mummery, stuffed and dead.’ ”
. Every year, everywhere, especially in college, do young men find
all things faulty.	.	.	;
Sometimes the criticism is caused by inadequate experience,' some-
times by inadequate information. The world is quite right in a million
ways, but only the knocks of the world can persuade youth that it is
right.
A wise fool is the youth who finds fault. Though his opinions may
be foolish, they are healthy signs of an active mind. What a foolish
wise one is he who goes through everything with padlocked lips and
stupid smile ! One need not lament a dash of enthusiasm that, indicates
a forming mind ultimately due to approach correct perspective. Rather
be ashamed to have a mirid blank and dead, fronted by a grinning face,
“like a smiling image pushed from behind. . . . . It is better,” says
Stevenson, “to emit a scream in the shape of a theory than to be
entirely insensible to the jars and incongruities of life and take every?
,thing as it comes in a forlorn stupidity.”	'
But philosophers are not the only
ones who have become unbalanced
before the “misery and miitability”;
of life. Poets have erred just as
pitifully. One pardons them with
greater ease. For it is their want
to enlarge upon. things. . There is
one—it may be Shelly, or perhaps
Tennyson—-who writes of life as
though it were merely a place’ .? ;
“Where* palsy shakes a few,, sad;
last gray hairs,	!
. Where youth- grows pale, and
. spectre-thin and dies;.. ■
Where but to think is to be full of
• sorrow . * ; ...
And leaden-eyed; despairs; :
Where beauty: cannot, keep, her lus-i-
trous.eyes,,	■
Or new love pine: at them beyond
tomorrow.” •	?	.
Of course that is a dreamy-eyed
kind of pessimism, blue-goggled
diction conceived by a gouty- niihd
and written in a cellar. But. there
is another variety, less .lugubrious,
though equally, dismal. Here it is
in a line of Faust: .	‘	•
“I’ve studied now Philosophy, J
And Jurisprudence," Medicine,— :
And even, alas, Theology,— .
From end to end with labor keen;
The clownish do not write be-
cause they have never learned any-
thing ■ correctly. The despondent
break into print because they have
learned too much wrongly, and
hence the company of their thoughts
is so intolerable that they must
perforce drive them out in. order to
enjoy a little peace. Both see life,
obliquely/ and hence neither sees it
correctly. The one laughs at ev-j
erything because he hasn’t sense
enough to be serious; the other
weeps at everything because he has
an exaggerated sense of his own
importance. He thinks himself
worthy of Paradise, and lo, he has
inherited only a planet.
To attempt to . say whether there
is more joy than sorrow in life is
like trying to answer the ques-
tions, How many are too many?
and How much is too little? We
can only answer: “That depends.”
We have witnessed laughter beside
the grave, and weeping at weddings^
the same news bring both tears and
cheers. It is safe to say that any
attempted striking of a balance be?
tween these; two would only mix
one up. And-that seems to give us
the right cue to the situation. Joy
and sorrow ' are hopelessly mixed,
commingled with one another.
They blend into one another and,
like the Heraclitan. “Strife” and
“Harmony,” keep up a perpetual
process of cyclical evolution. ■
Life is not merely a laughing-
stock. God. did; not create us in
fun. Yet neither is it a master-
piece in ruins to be eternally wept
oyer. Man has only half spoiled it';
and so . it .is both funny and fright?

What Others Say
THE CONCERT
On Wednesday night last, the student body witnessed a perform-
ance which reflects great credit upon the school, and one which shows
what can be accomplished by an earnest group working under capable
leadership. The concert given by the Notre Dame Glee Club has’set
a new standard in our musical circles, and we can say, with pardonable
pride, and with no fear of contradiction, that the organization is fully
as good as any similar club iri other schools. .	’	. .
* But the students do not, perhaps, appreciate the inonths of con-
stant rehearsal which made the concert possible. We see the club on
the concert platform only, and are apt to forget the work that has gone
before, the spirit of .willing cooperation and sacrifice of time that has
gone to make it a success!	.	.
- To Dr. J. Lewis Browne, to Mr. Joseph J. Casasanta, and to the
club members, the DAILY wishes to express its appreciation of their
splendid work in. moulding a Glee Club that is expressive of Notre
Dame at its best.	'

: The Challenge to Youth
Now, more than at any other
time during the progress of strug-
gling humanity,, the youth of' the
world has been put to a test. From
•the earliest- days of recorded his-
tory down to the present era there
have been would-be reformers
day-dreamers, and idealists who
have devised schemes for salvaging
Youth from impending disaster. It
seems that the young men and wo-
men of the-world have kept on mak-
ing the world better, with, or with-
out the counsel of their elders.
‘ Even, at this time, when we have
emerged successfully from this
great world catastrophe, there are
-those who - feel that they are en-
tirely right when they pronounce
this the languid generation. Are
we addicted1 to sluggishness, mental
debility, and stagnation in the pools
by the evermoving stream of swift
thought? Do we accept things 4
merely as they are, without thought
or question? Students, the youth
of the world, are accused of hav-
ing enjoyed the comforts and- lux-
uries of life so long that they have
grown passive, languid to all that
goes on about them. Are we so
complacent?
Those who have found fault ■with
the youth of the. world have, given
us something-to think about. Are
we as different aspictured? Are
we the languid generation? Over
the whole earth Youth is rising to
make, known its claim and power,
whether it is manifested-in nation-
alist revolts, or quaking of intel-
lectual- unrest. Now the challenge
is sent out to the youth of the ,
world. Will we meet it?' That de-
pends on our attitude, but the signs
are increasingly"' ‘hopeful—Green

; University, Chicago, where he is head- coach.

We doubt whether Addison Sims

come tumbling after.
To Catherine Calvert we must

iginal, and well above par. Gen-

ways noisy, and occasionally fun-

Jans and Whalen are just two
young fellows trying to get along,
and: they’re doing pretty well,
thank you. ’ During this act you are
in for a few laughs, not very bois-
terous, but laughs nevertheless.
The vaudeville ball is started
rolling by Embs and Alton, who
try to say it with music. They do
fairly well in the attempt, and re-
ceive their modicum of applause.
The “Gilded Gage” is all about
a pretty girl who gets suspended
over the audience in a wire cell.
Why she’s there, or how she. gets
out, nobody seems to know. It’s
original, however, and that’s half
the battle.

By order of the University Board of

The writer’s initials . at least must be

Editor of the DAILY:
Having a natural dislike for con-
troversial discussion it is with some
hesitancy that I inyade your ■ col-
umn. I would be recreant to my
duty, however, if I permitted the
well written letter of “Bookworm,”
which appeared in your column to
go by unnoticed. ' -
All the complimentary things
that were written by “Bookworm”
about the South Bend library are
true. I- myself would like to add
to the list, and believe that the aid
which the down-town library has
given to Notre Dame students is
worthy of editorial recognition in
the DAILY. It might also be prop-
erly said that no library in the
country boasts a more courteous
staff than the South Bend library.
However, I believe that the im-
plications concerning our Univer-
sity library in the letter of “Book-
worm” are fundamentally unfair.
I believe that “Bookworm” writes
with sincerity and with good inten-
tions but his letter shows, that he
has not investigated th’e ’"reas'ons
why conditions are what they. are
in Lemmonier library. In company
with another student, I spent over
five hours studying the workings of
the library, and after spending
some time with the librarian, Father
Foik, I am convinced that the poli-
cies which Father Foik pursues are
not only justifiable but any change
in policies under present conditions
would be entirely unwarranted.
If “Bookworm” . investigated he
would discover that the University
library at one time did have books
displayed in the lobby, but due to
the fact that many students abused
their privileges and took books with-
out signing for them, that policy

had to be discontinued. If “Book-
worm” would consult Father Foik
and learn the exact number of
books missing never to return, at
the end of the. display experiment,
he would be astonished. It is'ob-
vious then, that perverted tenden-
cies among students themselves, or
rather I should say among the small
minority of the students, necessi-
tate rather drastic rules at the li-
brary.
As for the periodical section,
magazies once too were attractively
displayed in the reference room,
but again because of the same un-
fortunate practices of certain indi-
viduals, the regulations of the li-
brary had. to be changed so that the
magazines would be there for the
whole student, body. If “Book-
worm” had investigated in this de-
partment he would have discovered
that the “Literary Digest” was for-
merly removed, from the library so
consistently every week that Father
Foik offered to buy the degenerate
who took the magazine a subscrip-
tion if he would but leave the li-
brary’s copy within the building.
And so one might go on and ex-
plain conditions that apparently
seem unsatisfactory. But further
explanations are not needed, for
any student by . consuming a little
time in making inquiries and in
talking with members of the library
.staff will readily understand that
policies of Lemmonier library are
what they are because the students
have created the conditions and
Father Foik has enacted stringent
rules to meet conditions.
At this point I might say some
very complimentary things about
Lemmonier. library but shall not
'consume the space. Here again any
student by asking a few questions
will , learn that the library staff is
providing books and references for
something like thirty different de-
partments of the University, that
Father Foik and competent assis-
tants are at work at the present
time doing things that will ulti-
mately make the University library
one of the most efficient in the
country. Much might be written
on the University library for the
administration of a modern univer-
sity library at the present time is a

difficult business in itself. But I
merely would leave this letter which
suggests more than it tells with the
plea that more students make it
their business to discover just what
is going on at the library.
As for “Bookworm” perhaps he
has investigated and disagrees with
Father Foik on questions of policy,
but rather do I believe that he
wrote his letter in a- hurry without
troubling himself to study condi-
tions at the library. To any fair-
minded reader his comparison of
the University library with a city
library must appear unjust. One
might compare Notre Dame library
with a similar institution at other
schools, but the problems and poli-
cies of university libraries are nec-
essary and naturally different than
those of city libraries.
In conclusion, why should stu-
dents take advantage of the liberty
of speech privilege by making the
library, just one of the institutions
at Notre Dame, the “goat,” as it
were, for their ululating letters. I
believe that if every department at
this University were conducted
jwith the same efficiency and with
’the same resulting satisfaction as
'Lemmonier library, the great Notre
Dame would be a greater Notre
Dame.

Juniors Talk Prom
at Quiet Meeting
> No startling complications dis-
turbed the meeting of the Junior
class held Friday noon in the south
room of the library. The purpose
, in calling the meeting was to iron
out all differences of the class con-
cerning the Junior Prom and to
complete the plans for the same.
Announcement was made of the ac-
tion of the Faculty Dance Commit-
tee reducing the price of the Prom
tickets from twelve and a half to
ten dollars. This committee also
- ruled that all decorations, enter-
tainment, and the serving of punch
should be omitted at the Prom. -
Gilbert . Schaefer, head of the
Prom Committee, then made his re-
port and stated what changes would
be made in the budget in accord-
ance with the faculty ruling. Much
individual discussion followed, in
which not only was the budget ap-
proved but several items were con-
sidered too low; The class voted
almost as a whole—there were but
about 15 dissenting votes out of the
200 juniors present—as heartily in
favor with the plans advanced by
the Prom committees, several of
which, the Decorations and Music,
made reports, and that they consid-
ered $12.50 as the proper price for
the Prom.	.
As a result of this meeting def-
inite action will be taken in Prom
matters within the next few days.
Those interested seriously in a
$12.50 Prom are asked to see John
Moran, Corby hall, today.

THE RUB DOWN
... . By TOM COMAN	:
- The Junior Week festivities of
Cornell University imposed a rath-
er strict penalty on the Cornell
trackmen who. are entered in the
Harvard-Dartmouth-Cornell meet in
Boston next Saturday. In . order
that rigid training rules might be
lived up to, the. Cornell athletes
turned hermits for the Junior Week
and took up their abode in the attic
of the Schoellkopf club, where the
invasion of the. fair visitors might
not- intrude upon the ' “trackish”
thoughts of. the men . who are deter-
mined that Cornell shall win the
triangular meet. '	.
The Cornell runners having mus-
tered: up all the fortitude that is
symbolic of loyalty to their school,
express ttyemselves as being im-
mune to the most tempting synco-
patipn, and the magnetic demeanor
of hundreds of the fair sex that
have poured into Ithaca for the big
social event of the year. These
men are more than mere men.

The Chicago Nationals will leave

As the trunks are being packed
for the trip west, news leaks out
about the refusal of Charley Hol-
lo cher to sign the Cub contract.
The. Chicago shortstop, who is the
prize doll of the north side horse-
hide-slingers, claims that he must
be paid his back salary before he
will sign on the dotted line. The
sum in controversy amounts to
something like $4,500. '	.
President Veeck says Hollocher
will either sign up or sign , out of
big time baseball forever and that
he is willing to pay up the back sal-
ary in two installments payable in
1924.and 1925.	*	.

For the good of .the game, the'
rule permitting r specialized foul-
shooting has been legislated out of
the books and coaches throughout
the country are unanimous in their
opinion that basketball will be the.
better for the move. ‘	-
. On nearly every team there is at
least one man who is an expert on
raising the score with foul throws.
To no small extent this jeopardized
the sportsmanship of the game for
it gave an invaluable opening to un-
scrupulous coaches. There was a
great possibility that such coaches
would train their teams to become
foul victims on every possible, oc-
casion and thus give the expert foul
scorer a chance to get into action.
In the Harvard-Dartmouth game
last year, Dartmouth raised 25
points in 27 foul throws, due to
the expert eye of Captain Cullen.
Basketball, of all games, should
be immune from the specialty man.
As a five man game, every player
on the floor should be a potential
scoring factor and the pass game
Would be emphasized more than it
has been-in the past.
