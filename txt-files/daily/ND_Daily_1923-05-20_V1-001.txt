Records in-Meet at, -
Cartier Field -
By THOMAS W. COMAN
. - - .While -breaking'.two- local -field
records here this afternoon,- Notre
Dame easily won from the Michigan
: Aggies- tracksters, 93 to 323^.
After-getting a rainy start-.in1 the
mornings the day ’ became more
promising? as . the . afternoon ap-
proached, bringing with it a strong
south wind; that handicapped the ■
middle distance runners on the back :
' stretch. . The / slight -shower in. the
-morning did not seem to affect the
. / field for running hor .for attendance,
which was doubly attractive because
of the host of out-of-town guests
- for the;Senior Ball in attendance.-
Tom Lieb^ candidate for the com-
. ing Olympics and one of the. great-
est weight men in this year’s inter-
collegiate : cpinpetitibn, ? threw the
; discus for-a new local-field/record
. of 137 feet;'.6 inches, while Moes
and Oberst repeatedly, drew the .
crowd to their feet, by their efforts
to outdo each other in the javelin.'
Moes finally succeeded in establish- ,
ing a hew field, rqcord with a thrbw
of 196, feet, 5 'inches, beating the
old mark by. 14’feet, 10 inches, held
by Brede, of Illinois. ? Oberst took
" second with a throw of 187 feet, .the
Aggies entrant’being unable po keep
, ’ up to that, distance.. .
The Michigan squad gathered sev- .
eral./secorids and thirds in the track
/V-VCJalo'^btlfr'^nll''-'Vpok’-U.. U ,
firsts during .the whole meet, being
'^’ forced, to their utmost-in the dashes,
- and/distance: runs;- Hartsuch, of
;the Xggies, showed up well .in the
half milej crossing the tape five
. yards ahead of :.Tom;Barber. Hart-
■ such took the lead'at the start, with
• ' Disney running third.. He held his
■- place till the back; stretch of the last
' : quarter when Disney’pulled up; fol-
Towed by Barber, keeping'the place
: / till on'the last turn, the Aggie-.riin-
ner swept -by the- leaders with a
burst of speed and crossed the tape
in 2:01. , '	; • ,
The two mile -run was another
sweep, Weritland, Cox and Connell,
• / taking all three places. This was
-V Wentland’s first win. in track corn-
: r. petition, having -been a big. factor
in the cross-country work of last
fall.; Paul Kennedy, whp took the
. ; lead at the start of the mile run,
never lost it;arid crossed the tape in-
4:35 1-5. His running inate, Shee-
.-- han; the find of the^ Interhall sea-
son, ran a. good race and finished in
, ' third place in a field of five starters.

A daily paper may be regarded
both as a source and as,a.fruit of
the greater Notre Dame program.
It is a . source in the sense .that it
should be, and undoubtedly will be,
an important factor in .the . future
growth and development of our uni-
versity.. Through its creation of a
public’ opinion. in. the student, body,
through the' initiation bf various
activities, and-through'the preser-
vation of the historic Notre Dame
spirit,- the' DAILY. will aid in'; the
future progress of* Notre Dame.,
Secondly; the DAILY- is a .fruit
of the greater Notre. Dame program
in the sense-that it’-has been made
at once both possible .and necessary.,
by the recent rapid growth in the
number of students;, This increase
in number has made.',the publication
of a daily’newspaper feasible from
the standpoint of circulation.; -And.
at the? same.-time the increase in the
number of - off-campus students ■ lias
made the' DAILY, a * necessity, if the
Notre Dame spirit, of which we have
been so proud,, is to be-.maintained.
.. Being thus- bound up -with -the
greater Notre Dame, - the /DAILY;
therefore,- has. a close 'relationship,

Notre Dame. Rev. Dr. - Matthew' j.
Walsh; as president of, the’ univer-

Two Oliver Dances, The Ball,
a Track Meet is
Program
By CLIFFORD B. WARD
Four years of beautifully-imag-
ined. dreams materialized for Notre'-
Dame seniors this week,, justifying • •
the dreams of . dreamiest youth.
The occasion was the much-talked .
of, and much-reflected -upon, Sen-
ior Ball.- Probably the first thing:
that a freshman allows-his thoughts .
to- dwell upon after picturing him-
self receiving a degree, is' the Ball.
Succeeding/ classes year- after, year
strive- with all the energies: that
they can-command and-combine,, to
make their Ball the best--that has
ever been held—and year after, year
they succeed.
The program for this year began
^Wednesday evening with an infor-: .
mal dance at the Oliver - Hotel/ the
formal Ball starting at nine o’clock -.
Thursday evening at the Palais Roy- -
ale.

A banquet preceded the for-.
Ball to' which chaperones, pat- -

•• senior class..-.
roris, and patronesses were invited,
and at.iwhich.favors and programs. /
for the dance,--were distributed. The ...
favors this year 'consisted of leather '
cigaret cases for the men, and a’
Nbtre. Dame sister1 pin similar. to •
the regular senior 'class pin for :the •
women?. Each favor .bore the name J
bf its recipient, and that they pleas-
ed was unanimously conceded. The
dance program for, the dadie’s con- - .
sisted of a small, bronze ball en-

both as a source and as a fruit of
the greater Notre Dame program.
It. is a source in the sense that it

through the initiation of various

Secondly, the DAILY is a fruit

in number, has made the. publication
of a daily newspaper feasible from

at the same time the increase in the
number of. off-campus students has
made the DAILY a,necessity if the
Notre Dame spirit, o£ which we have
been so proud, is to be maintained.
Being thus bound up with the
greater Notre-Dame, the DAILY,
therefore, has arelationship

Don Gallagher, of Ogdensburg,

For vice president of the senior
class, Leo Cavanaugh drew, a popu-
lar opponent in the . person of
“Dutch”’ Bergman, III, the latter
being elected by a vote of 110 to

ular candidate at any of this year’s
elections. He was unanimously se-
lected for the office of treasurer.
The race for secretary was closely
contested; Mike Gibbons was re-
turned victor over O’Donnell, 155
to 128. Gallagher has gained, for
- himself tlie-na'me' orTieTng-a parti c--
ularly hard worker, a man of real
judgment and efficiency. “Dutch”
Bergman is known prominently in
the athletic world for. his prowess in
football, baseball and track. .	.
The sophomore class met in
Washington Hall and chose between
John Moran and Paul McNulty for
president. Evidently the sophs
thought football- would' keep Paul
busy next year, for Moran, of Tulsa,
Okla., was chosen over McNulty
by 143 to 84. The.sophomore law-

ined dreams materialized for Notre
Dame seniors this week,, justifying-
the dreams of dreamiest youth.
The occasion was the much-talked
of,' and much-reflected upon, Sen-
ior Ball. Probably the first thing
that a freshman allows his thoughts
to dwell upon after picturing him-
self receiving a degree, is the.Ball.
Succeeding-classes year after year
strive with all the .energies that
they can command'and combine, to .
make their Ball the best that has
ever been held—and year after year
they succeed.
The program, for this year began
Wednesday evening -with an infor-
mal dance at the Oliver Hotel, the
formal Ball starting at nine o’clock
Thursday evening at the Palais Roy-
aler A banquet preceded the for-
mal Ball to which chaperones, pat-


Maurice J. Dacy, president of the
senior class.	.	. -
rons, and patronesses were invited,. .
and at which favors and programs
for the dance were distributed. The
favors this year consisted of leather
cigaret cases for the- men, and a ,
Notre Dame sister pin similar to
the regular senior class pin for the
women. Each favor bore the name '
of its recipient, and that they pleas-
ed was .unanimously conceded. The •
dance program for the ladies con-
sisted of a small. bronze ball en-
graved with a suitable Senior Ball
inscription, and containing inside
small pages for dance, arrange-
ments, and the names of patrons
and patronesses, while the program
for the men was made. less elab-
orate. .'The banquet was begun

From OffStage
By JOHN BRENNAN
When you come to think of it, it
is surprising how easy it is to attend
a theater with the intention of find-
ing flaws in the performance, espe-
cially if one has had this purpose in
mind before leaving the admittance
fee, plus tax, at the box office. It
takes no extraordinary amount of
intelligence to give the attraction
the generous rating of 12^ per
cent under these circumstances.
For this state of mind, which may
be assumed with little difficulty, as
notable ,a personage as Brander
Mathews has no sympathy. It was
he who remarked that the function
• of criticism is not that of a fire
qngine:. a perfectly equipped ma-
chine that can rush to the theater
on nine seconds’ notice, prepared
■ to throw large quantities of cold
water upon everything within range
of its devastating stream.. More
often than no.t this complex^arises
from the fact that the -witness has
-. no particular liking for the type of
thing he is seeing, or because he
affects a haughty disdain for any-
> thing which does not strike the high
note of the Moscow Art Theater.
-Either motive is pernicious when
you consider that from the perform-
er’s point of view there is as much
artistry in the acrobat’s tumbling
-feats as there is in the,excellent
pantomime of Charlie Chaplin or in
. Leo Ditrichstein’s bland “Purple
: Mask.”
(Personal likes or dislikes should
not enter the question at all. What
should be considered is: Is the pur-
pose achieved? Is the ideal attain-
ed and is the ideal a worthy one?
The proper attitude is one of sym-
pathy, one that appreciates serious
representations of life and accepts
honst fooling in the proper.spirit.
' “The Wallflower,” which was
■shown at the Blackstone the first
part of the week, is a typical Rupert
- Hughes picture in which the ugly
duckling becomes a beautiful swan.
' \ It may be said in a spirit of: appre-
- ciation for the work of . Colleen
Moore, and for the- skillful portray-
■ - al-of the humiliations she suffers;
. that the ■ audience. feels heartily
..... sorry, for-her,..withal it knows that
——she~vnll~bldssbmsforthp-the'envy~of-
- her tormentors. The metamorpho-
sis is, if anything, a bit sudden; it
is hard to believe that an awkward
girl could become so charming and
graceful in a* few weeks, even* under
the' capable guidance of Gertrude
: ~Astbr,“'who: plays the'angel of the
•.. , piece and takes the outcast into her
care.' Richard Dix moves through
the story .in the usual Dix fashion,
which is to say that no more could
be desired.
‘ --The action is a trifle slow, and
> -. the plot, is by no means startlingly
-< new; it depends for its effect upon
' - . ■ the human interest it arouses rather
■■■ than upon any message which it has
to impart, but if this is its purpose
■ it fulfills it admirably/ The trio of
. stars who appear in it would-pro-
'vide- excellent entertainment
much less beguiling fable.
• As a rule it has. been the
in a
good
./fortune: of men to have’their names
; connected with famous plays; one
does not think of “Rip Van Winkle”
■ without Joseph Jefferson, or of.
“Lightnin’” without a vision of
- Frank Bacon'in the lead. It is Lau-
"• . rette Taylor’s lot to. upset the rule,
' just , as she upsets , the well-ordered
: ' • ■Chichester household as Peg in
■< “Peg O’ My Heart., “Peg O’- My
- ■ Heart” without her is as impossible
' to ■ imagine as to picture Damon
1 without Pythias.
? * The screen story of the Irish girl
who vowed that she would hot be
- more of a lady than she was by
nature proves to.be as entertaining
.. <as the originaLplay which is not al-
ways the case with such ventures.
/It is an ideal vehicle for the star’s
■ debut in the movies, bringing with;
. her, as she does, a ’well-earned rep-.
utation on the legitimate stage,
' where the perennial Peg was first
■ introduced. It is well directed and
splendidly acted by a. cast in: which
Mahlon Hamilton shares the. honors
with Miss Taylor. And Michael , is
there, of course.

: / ’ “Patsy,”. Wednesday and 'Thurs-
.day’s attraction-at the Blackstone,,
was a picture in .which Zasu Pitts,
■ as the hoyden of the title, had sun-
dry adventures calculated to please
' the'younger members of the- moyie-
: . going public, as well as those, who,
7. no. longer young, remember the
days of their- youth when the “gang”
had their allegiance, and when that
same gang was the most important
thing on earth. The story concerns
a long-lost father’. who retains a
secret.of the alchemists, dark deeds
on the part of the villain, the ulti-
mate failure of the alchemist’s ex-
periment, and his reunion to his
wife. . Tom Gallery and Wallace
Beery in the roles of hero and vil-
lain respectively are two very good
reasons for any success the offer-
ing had, and Marjorie Daw, the girl
to whom the bashful hero is afraid
to speak, is as good as she was in
the days when she assisted the agile
Mr. Fairbanks in adding to the
mirth of nations.
Miss -Elsie . Forschner, a Home
Economics graduate of next year,
gave her. certificate dinner Saturday
night in the Domestic Science din-
ing room. 'The guests included the
Prefect of. Discipline, the Dean of
the Home Economics Department,
the Misses Mae Kissane, Frances La
Pointe, Charlotte Hassmann, Eliza-
beth Maginnis, Kathleen Koock,
Mary Doyle, and Ruth Ann Taylor.
The dinner, called for. 6:30, was
prepared.; entirely by the hostess,
Miss Forschner, who was assisted
iu serving by Miss Margaret Hayes.
The menu consisted of shrimp cock-
tail, baked white fish, creamed po-
tatoes, cauliflower, baking powder
biscuits, olives, pickles, stuffed to-
mato ' salad, : strawberry shortcake,
and coffee. Jonquils formed an at-
tractive centerpiece, and the same
color scheme was carried out in
the decorations and favors.

PAPINI’S BOOK
Life of Christ, by Giovanni Papini trans-
lated-by Dorothy Canfield Fisher, pub-
lished by Harcourt, Brace and Company,
New York. $3.50.- .
Papini’s “Life of Christ” is not
only a bright light in modern litera-
ture, thought and philosophy, but it
is something more startling because
more personal; it is the revelation
of a man’s spiritual bouleversement.
Papini was one of ,the prominent
“casters-off” of Italy; a man who
sneered at the bulwarks of our so-
cial life, and railed at authority,
civil or mental, but most, particu-
larly spiritual. And now the devil
becomes the saint.
It would appear from his own
words that: Papini stood at the base
of that great mountain, Spirituality,
and threw tremendous rocks at it.
But finally he threw so many stones
from the ground about him that he
uncovered the greeny flower-swept
fields. ' And he ' marvelled at the
beauty he- had disclosed, and bent
his knees in humble faith . while
tears of joy flowed from his eyes,
now. open.- '	‘	• ’
One of' the reasons for the great
vogue/ the book is . enjoying must
surely be that;it is hovel. This sup-
position has an unpleasant ring to
it, because the implication is that
we so seldom read devotional works
that when -we,: do discover one we
find it. diff erent. . • B e that as it may,
one sure reason for-the book’s suc-
cess is 'the remarkable, style/of-the
author, and the broad,, nori-sectarian
purposes-^-;/underlyirigp
Christ’s story , is told in clear bold
word-pictures, ; among which are
scattered reflections and interpreta-
tions which set the mind .to think-
ing, the soul to pondering, the heart
to aching one moment and pulsirig
with joy the' next/ The"diction is
vigorous, the. effects attained real-
istic.	-'	'
Love and hope are the ’ keynotes.
Perfection, can be attained if we
will re make our souls,, spurn the
things of the flesh arid embrace spir-
ituality. “The kingdom, of Heaven
is in us. Begin at once: ' it is our
work, for. our happiness in-this life
on earth. ; . . .. Become-perfect
and the kingdom., will extend even
on earth.” Perhaps Papirii’s high
hope is in, vain—but- who kno.ws?
And. even if love of Christ and of
all. things but, ourselves cannot lead
us to a heaven on earth, it can sure-
ly lead us to a heavenly eternity.—

learned that the Notre Dame

College. We fail to see the news

Judging from the number of fellows
seen around, here at various times

is also in dur curriculum. '

’ The other day we passed Bill

and Joe Donaldson, who were starid-

heard them mention- automobiles.
Probably they were making plans
to go, into business now that so
many cars are seen about the cam-
pus.; It .would not surprise us be-
cause at Stanford University - a
modern- concrete oil and gasoline
station is being erected for the con-
venience of the student motorists,
arid we suppose these men are con-
templating doing .the same thing.
If they do they will have a gold
mirie—or rather, an oil well.

Daily by Daily the Daily will be . getting better and better. .
The weekly Scholastic is dead, killed by the staffs of the Daily.

The Seniors used a gold ball for their programs—reminiscent of
visits to Uncle Abe’s the week before, eh?
THE GLASS
“Oh, wad some power'the giftie gie us
To see ourscls as ithers see us.’’,	:
We’re going to give you just that power.
The glass won't lie; the sweet and sour
Of what transpires every day
We’ll try to prove as best we may,
Has (every single.bit of it)—	•
Its little joke, its little twit.
So use the mirror to good, end;
Don’t fear to turn it on your friends.
Don’t balk in sending in some chaff
That you may think will give a laugh
To readers. It’s all just in fun,
And it won’t hurt “nobody none.’’
You’ll help to make the readers see
That sad as things oft seem to be
Each piece'of woe contains a nook • ■
Where smiles are cached if we but look.
And if we take a crack at you
Just think, perhaps you’ll see it, too; '
And if our stuff is not so glib.
Just send.along a swift contrib.
So: snappy things that come to pass'
Just pass in “Through the Looking Glass.”
* * *
It’s your duty to stand back of
the paper.
*. * * •
Not back of your roomie’s shoul-
der.
That would be making your
roomie a goat—or a mule.
Never stand back of a mule.
Speaking of mules: There was
once a freshman who tried to make
the football team. The coach asked,
“Can you kick?”:= “Sure,”' said the
frosh, “I’m a cousin of Nathan.”
• Jjc Jjc .
Stand back “of” the paper. “Of”
is a preposition; so is “from.”
.
But “of” is so much nicer; don’t
you think? A little.“of” never hurt;
do you think?

You don’t?

YOUR DAILY
The Notre Dame Daily; which introduces itself with this issue, is
. your paper. You may accept it or'reject, it. Its futurei rests entirely
upon the interest shown by- those -for whom it has been brought irito
existence. .Before-the close:of/the present term .13 issues of. the-Daily
'will have been published; and-the success or failure of those issues,
judged by the support of the student.body during this period, will deter-
jmine the ultimate success or failure of Notre Dame’s paper.
The sale of advertising-space is the chief means of financial support
which any paper possesses. But this space cannot.be sold without the
moral support of the subscribers. ?Imorder that advertising.contracts
; may be secured for next yeary it is absolutely necessary that a large and
guaranteed subscription list should be secured now. As the, advertising
/rate for some time will be ?based’ upori the circulation of these first
issues, it may be readily seen- that those. who delay subscribing until
- -after the summer vacation will fail'to giye the paper the full beriefit
-. of their subscription.	/?
It is characteristic of the Notre Dame man-that he should be with
a project from the very start. . He does not. withhold his/support until
. .the thing has been decided. And in this case it should .be a matter of
- personal pride that, as a Notre Dame alumnus, in years to come you
will be able to say, “I was with the Daily from the very first issue.” /
The Daily is of-necessity compelled to begin in a modest way ;
: . but with the support of the students and friends of the university it will
extend, itself. - Arrangements , have already been made whereby . the
National Catholic Welfare Council News Service will be received riext
-September. : The'Associated Press service, may also be contracted for.
The Notre Dame Daily, therefore, asks your support now because its
growth is dependent upon you, and because it .feels that Just insofar
as it does receive your support will it be able’to serve you as it should.
OUR SENIORS
The cotillion carnival which closed the Gold and Blue, indoor sea-
- < son, the apogee of the 1923 social whirl, leaves im mellow retrospect;
a tinge of pathos. The pageantry arid iridescent glamour of the event’
are shadowed with a .tone:of wistfulness for the laughing voice and
- filmy form in a glorious whirl of activity, are left only in reminiscence.
. -The happiest occasion in university life lias passed to become the'
■ . subject of recollection when the men of 1923 sit about the fireside 'in
the homes that are to-be. -	.	. :	? - "	.	'
The Ball proceeded with magnificent eclat. Its side shows offered
profuse opportunity for. thrill,? and 'even the' weather turned propitious
for the upper-class merry makers.' The program planned by the edm-
.mlttees was tasteful and memorable. "In pulchritude; the-Ball presented,
a unanimous array of flawless complexion. The Ball was) of course,
/-the .-bestever.	.	-	.
? .. It . was a departure from its predecessors in many ways—partic-
- uularly from the time-sacred Oliver. In. some ways this is to be re-
. .gretted, but precedent . must not be held too sacred. ? We can imagine
.fhe Senior Ball a few years hence danced on the. campus and then tile
/ . /place will be fixed. That is tthe appropriate placer The Palais Royale,
■ .however, is all that can be desired. The prettily gowned young ladies
made pretty bits of color agairist the'-resplendent lighting of that elab-
. -orate ball room. The effect was such?that;:tliere was hardly-:-any seriior
iwho was not enchanted by: what he saw and heard. The music played
. ?hy Ilqy Bargy and the Red Jackets was the kind-that made feet willirig
to dance; without thought of end. ? The music was irresistible; it put
-: -poetry into the blood and inspiration into the toes. -
. In-all, the Ball was'a .splendid affair, and Maurice Dacy and his
amen ,are. to .be? felicitated.
Yes, you got it. Two “jokes” in
one line. Imagine that. Who’d a
thought it?

-. By the way, have you met Hooda
Thotut? Hpoda.is'a great boyj/Tt’s
a long'time now" since Hooda left
home. A year nbw since he: left the
snug little cottage on. the banks of
the Asterisk ?. . . - and that night
underneath the early autumn moon
when, she, nestled’close -in. his arms,
had kissed him happily but gravely
and-whispered that she would wait
the four (or fourteen)’ years until
he had made1 his ihark:at college,
and taken his place in the world , ot
men. -
And now we find Hooda one year
gone on his career. And the year
as a freshman has been profitable to
Hooda. He has made some of his
mark. -It was’ sixty.
So pleased was Hooda? with his
success that he wrote to his cousin
about his good fortunes. And
Hooda’s cousin, who .is a man,, ot
few. words, wrote back. . This is
what he wrote : -
. ' ? May 15, 1922. '
Dear Hooda:'	' •	,
' So you have made sixty! Great.,
Good-bye,;

OTHER EDITORS
IS WOODROW RIGHT?
■(Daily Cardinal, Wisconsin) ' /
, The—views, of ;aUfbxmg^Uc.Qnege:
president. are . always interesting.-
But mo're so are the views/.,of a/col-
lege president who. has/also been
president: of the natiom/ ,	,
So when Woodrovr Wilson says
no one has ever hoped ..to impart
“learning” to college undergradu-
ates, we: are.included and we sit up
and take notice. '	? .
Why go to college? ?
Association with anything tends
to make a person lose the perspec-
tive of purpose. Students often,
consequently, forget the real aim
of college. . With a variety of out?'
side activities, study seems at some,
times to be a minor detail; ’ .	:
But is it true? .	. ?
Learning cannot be imparted to
undergraduates, Wilson, says.
“It cannot be. done in four years.
To become -a man of learning, is
the enterprise of a life-time.”
: AVhat part /then' has’the outside,
.activity in university life?. The/ex-
tra-scholastic phase of our work? /
The aim -of the university,', ac-
cording to Wilson, is to give a “dis-
cipline which: will .fit men for the
contests and. achievements of i an
age whose: every task is conditioned
upon some intelligent and effective
use of the mind, upon some substan-
tial knowledge, some special insight,
some attained capacity, some pene-
tration which* comes from stAdy,
not from natural readiness or- nlere
liracHchl/experieric^___[ .,
. Then., should colleges abolisiTduF-
side activity? ?: Such 'would be folly.':
But outside, activities have their
place in university life, and accord-:,
ing to Wilson, should -be subordi-
nated.. They should -be"diversic ns;
not occupations. ■	. . -

Brownson Hall defeated Badin
Hall 12-4 Thursday afternoon on
the varsity diamond in a slow game.
' The power of Brownson became
more evident as the game progress-
ed, and finally overwhelmed the Ba-
dinites. : Pitcher Enright, of Brown-
son, allowed but six scattered hits,
while the Brownson' batsmen hit
Pitchers Gallagher and Mouch, of
Badin, for 15 hits and 12 runs.
Badin played , a poor fielding game
and accumulated eight errors.
> Brownson displayed a powerful,
well balanced club'of hard hitting
'and fast fielding ball playei’s. The
game was featured by a play' by
Scherer, Brownson’s shortstop, who
ran behind third base for a fast
■ grounder and put out the runner by
a perfect throw. Outfielder Mc-
Keown, of Brownson, got four hits,
including a triple, in as many times
at bat. Callahan, and Smith played
well for Badin. .

SENIOR BALL IS
WEEK’S CLIMAX
AT THE SENIOR BALL
W. P.Cass, Mgr. Bell Phone 2231
Crown Service Co.
Girls From Many States Attend
Elaborate Occasion
Here
A smile, the shimmer of gold
cloth, the twinkling of silvered feet
and—and the Senior Ball of the
. class of ’23 was on!
No fairy-godmothers ventured be-
yond the confines of the dressing
rooms but countless Cinderellas
'were whisked to the scene of the
, festivities in equippages as yellow
as Cinderella’s own. .
The banquet, served in the ball
- room of the Palais Royale was, as
- a senior would put it, fit for prin-
cesses and kings. The flowers in
slender vases, and the Blue and
■ Gold of the decorations were a back-
ground for beautifully gowned
maidens. Following the banquet,
the maids and the men were lost in
/ the mazes of the dance. Through-
. out the evening the tinkle of fem-
inine laughter made a delightful
' treble for the'masculine voices. The
goddess of gaiety reigned. With
Maurice Dacy, senior president, was
. Miss Eileen Smith, of Chicago, in a
. delicate green gown of ; colonial
fashion, with bouffant skirt and de-
mure bodice; a silver head-band and
: slippers completed the costume.
. Following, were a retinue of love-
ly ladies. Miss Marion Rempe, also
of Chicago, was gowned, in, red se-
. quins. Miss Mercedes Fenlon, of
Meadville, Pa., was attired in an
/attractive frock of green and gold.
/ • The same color was repeated in her
. bandeau. ? Miss Helen Minahan, ' of
; Atlanta, Ga.', , was charming ' in a
? gown of soot-gray, embroidered in
‘ blue beads. Miss Marcella Newburg,
•- Medford, Wis., presented a delight-
ful picture -in a soft pink satin, J enT
; hanced by silver slippers and head-
dress. South Bend was charmingly
• represented by Miss Mary’ Virginia
' Hull; who iwore a becoming gown of
jrreen chiffon velvet,/, and: by. Miss
Mary'- Jo " Miller, "'attractive--’in''-a
. ■ straight-line gown of white, ■ made
. dashing by head-dress and pumps of
' green. Mishawaka loaned to ; the
festivities the'charming Miss Ruth
Bassett, in a charming creation of
salmon chiffon, set off by a girdle
'*/arid~fam of~ deep .blue; Miss Elea-:
? nore Roth, of Roseland, was a vivid
.. -picture in a gown of green: and sil-.
. ver; Miss Margarite Coleman, of
> Niles, Mich., was stunning in silver
'• cloth, carrying a black, feather, fan.
' Gracious - in • gaiety -were . girls
■ ■ from up? Fort Wayne way. . Miss
' : ‘ Mildred /Miller was vivacious in a
. tomato chiffon embroidered in steel
•• beads/and Miss Caroline Mungovan
■ and Miss \Beatrice: Baltes were love-
? ly, both in. frocks of orchid chiffon
.- and' silver, lace; Miss Catherine
. Cleary wore a gown of brocaded
, chiffon velvet of deep, orchid, drap-
,ed with'silver.
'	; Miss Edna Smith,' of Chicago, was
'/ gowned in white chiffon, embroider-
ed with colored beads. Miss-Helen
Monahan, of Chicago, wore a dress
/ of - delicate pink with which she car-
■ ried a fan’of deep blue. Miss .Mar-
/. ■ tha - Singler. was striking in: a gown
' of deepest orange: hue, made effe'e-
/ tive by pumps and bandeau of gold.
/ Miss'Lois Connellj of Decatur, Ill.;
was also in orange, and her gown
was completed by girdle, pumps and
■ ' head-dress, of silver. // ,	•
; On through the hours dancers
. .' followed the-lure of the ■ music. ,Un-
' like the old story^.these Cinderellas
- heeded not’ the midnight hour. It.
' was / only when the sun . peeped1 at
>' them in .the red horizon that dresses
■ were enveloped in evening cloaks,
'and the drowsy princesses ..were
. .?- handed again into coaches and four.

Terre Haute, a frenzied search for
collar-buttons and ties, and finally
a triumphant return to the College.
The Prom was an ■ extravaganza

, cils.	. .

rides, shows; and long, lorig conver-
sations. At five there was tea, and

tending the Prom were Edgar Mil-
ler, Leslie Logan, Harry Stuhl-
