of the meeting will be announced
before June 1.
A choice is to be made from the
following list< of propositions sug-
gested . by debating coaches at In-
diana colleges: (
1.	Resolved, that the United
States should enter the League of
Nations with the Lodge reserva-
tions. (The negative is: to oppose
entering the League of Nations un-
der any conditions whatever.)

adopt in principle the Wisconsin

Next Year’s Schedule
A tentative schedule -of debates
for the Notre Dame debating team
of next year, includes .a triangular
series—withmD ePau wJ an d / /Wab ash,,
beginning the/early part of March.
Negotiations have been entered into
with Indiana and Purdue for de-
bates during, the year, but no defi-
nite dates have been’set for these
meets yet. ’;
. The record by the . team this year
and the renewed interest being man-
ifested in the work, are expected
,to induce many students to compete
for places on the Notre Dame team
of next year. Several-of this year’s
men are -seniors, and consequently
there will be opportunities for new
men to fill the .vacated places. ■ \

PUBLICATION
BOARD PLANNED
FOR NEXT YEAR
Cheer Leader Selected by
S. A. C. if Students
Want it So
A publication board, a freshman
handbook, and plans for the election
of a cheer leader by the Students’ .
Activities Committee, were consid-
ered and favored by the S. A. C. in
a special meeting last night in the
library.
Although a publication board has
been definitely- decided upon, con- -
sisting of Henry Barnhart, Carl
Barr, and James Swift, of the S. A.
C., the plans for this board are. yet
to be determined. The election of
representatives of the publicaitons •
controlled by the board, to the
board, and the publications that will
be controlled by the board, are yet
to be settled.	.
Definite plans for the selection of ;
cheer leaders were proposed by Wil-
liam Voss, of the election commit-
tee, and his plans were accepted by
the S. A. C.' The plans will be pub-
lished in the DAILY on Friday, and
the students are asked to make crit-
icisms and suggestions of these
plans. They propose many changes
in the manner of selecting the cheer,
leaders. '.	.
A freshman handbook has been
put in charge of a committee con-,
sisting of Mark Nolan, James Swift
and, Robert Cahill, and the plans
will be ready this summer/ and the
book placed in the hands of the '
class when'/they-arrive in Septem^~
her. The book will contain tradi-
tions and information concerninjg
Notre Dame, so that the freshmen
be able to know Notre Dame as well
as possible when they arrive;
That the Dome will be named
after the graduating class, the next
one, therefore, the 1924 Dome, that
a .frame will, be furnished for the
Notre Dame monogram sign, and
that the treasurer’s report for the
present year will be published in the
DAILY Friday, was also passed by
the. class.	■

OUR ADVERTISERS
Notre Dame men have seldom before been accused of disloyalty.
. It has been regarded as dangerous to do so. There are some men in
. South Bend, however, who are becoming stronger in their conviction
that the appeals made to Notre Dame through the campus. publications
’ are not responded to very loyally. This connection between loyalty and
the complaints of these men may not be very clear unless it is realized
that the students of Notre Dame owe those men in South Bend who
. ' advertise consistently in the college publications as much a..measure of
,	; loyalty and support as they owe their football teams or their debating
teams.- ■ •	.	. - •	■ - • - .	.	‘	.
\	: Things have come-to a point-now where solicitors for advertisirig
are told very frankly that the men of Notre Dame do not patronize
• - South Bend advertisers, and that the money invested in advertisirig on
. the campus can be used to much better advantage elsewhere’. One mer-
chant puts it very concisely when he says—/‘The Notre Dame men come
.to my store - whether I advertise or not;, so why should I advertise?”

, - . South Bend is growing larger , arid many merchants who catered
• . to Notre Dame trade some, years ago are now becoming indifferent to
.. ? this, source of revenue.. A great number,’however, realize that nearly.
two million dollars are left.every year at Notre Dame or South Bend
. • by students of the University, and, realizing this, arc making special
.. pleas ot Notre Dame students. It .is-the: duty of Notre Dame men to
. invest their money with the men who still desire’ the rpatronage of the
’ students—the men -who; advertise,--the men who will- advertise in the
. Daily,-the men who have advertised right along in other campus pub-’

HAZING AND EDUCATION 1
/ In a hazing last year at Northwestern University a “frosh” disap-
' ■ peared. Several days' ago a skeleton was discovered beneath a pier in
’. .Chicago, and .identified as his. This instance more tragic and for that
reason better known to , most of us .is not much’ different from? others
; ..which, occur every fall. Year after year students, pay for hazing' at a
- , price of not ,only, temporary- injuries but permanent deformities; Faeiil-
1 ;ties, despite their, very; evident duty; smile, on these activities as harm-
- less.; They may be, but mothers and, fathers of students think differ-
'	. ently. ? The man carrying around, for the rest of his life a. deformed
.	■ body thinks differently. The-world looking on the college as an institu-
tion worthy of the greatest respect, thinks differently. <	>
. . . ' ; Hazing loses everything and .gains nothing. Its existence any-
.- where is a disgrace. Education means, more than book lore. It calls
for the, inculcation of that* very uncommon: thing, common sense. When
./students, fail,,to,think for themselves,, the college is morally obligated
to do it for- them.- .There is no place in-university-life4for hazing, and
, , ;the sooner, students and faculties .realize this^ the sooner? will people be
willing to,acknowlcdge the merits of collegiate education.	.

The Techno-Log
From OffStage
CLASSIFIED
ROCK TO TALK
Beg Your Pardon
We find a slight error crept into
.our column on May 22. Albin A.
Rhomberg is asssitant city engineer
of Dubuque, Iowa, not Great Lakes,
Iowa.
The junior and senior chemical
engineers, under the guidance of
Mr. Byrne, left this morning at 7:40
o’clock on a five-day inspection trip.
In addition to the plan outlined in
the Log for May 20, these men will
examine the architectural exhibit
now being held at the Art Institute,
Chicago. Plans, have been complet-
ed for the bringing of a part of this
exhibit—the entries in the, Chicago
Tribune building contest—to Notre
Dame early in June.

■ Sports ~	>
■ In a closely contested game held
Monday afternoon, May 21, the Me-
chanical Engineers conquered the
Electrical Department Kappa Rhos,
19 to 15- , Revoyr, of the Boiler-
makers, held the Kappa Rhos pretty
well throughout the greater part of
the game, but he blew up in the last
inning and permitted nine runs to
be scored. Tiny Ray McGee took
his place’onthe mound, and, because
of the steam and smoke he put on
the ball the Electricals were unable
to score, Jo e.Mielcarek; manager
of the Boilermakers, caught the en-
tire game. Gibbons and Dombkow-
ski formed the' battery for the Kap-
pa Rhos. Special ■mention must be
made of McGee, Lautermilch,
Meagher, Ed. Sullivan, and Gibbons
... for their playing, Gibbons striking
. out 13. ' ■ ■ ■„ A'.	...
One misfortune marred the game.
Art Butterfield,, of the Electricals,
sprained-his ankle. A; mis-step1 in
crossing -first base threw him off
balance, and caused the injury.;
Mr. - Schubmehl umpired the en-
tire game. : Many of the Electricals
noted, his deep-, friendship for Re-
voyr; and though they- might have
thought it had some- bearing on the
final score, .they said nothing.. We
, only hope Mr. Schubmehl puts in a
second appearance on the -field; ’ if
- > he . does,' the Log should have some
' very exciting news.
The standing of the teams to date
is as follows:' :	‘
By JOHN BRENNAN -
The motion picture industry, af-
ter having regaled the proverbial
long suffering public with spectacles
of sex and syncopation,-has literally
run home to mother. Some of the
heart throb pictures are good; oth-
ers are not so good. “The Town
That Forgot God” is in the second
category. The flood scenes, one
must admit, are good, and the scenic
effects, on the .whole, are up to par.
, The story is old and it moves
slowly, by fits and starts, to its con-
clusion. In- casting it, the director
assembled a company of actors and
actresses, 'few of whom you will re-
member having seen before. The
boy. who plays the ’ leading part is
capable; he looks like Pat Moore
some three or four years hence.
Eben, the village carpenter, who re-
mains his friend through thick and
thin,’ is riot so fortunate.. His face
does not screen well, arid he, did not
seem to kriow just how his role was
to be interpreted. He should have
made the audience feel’ sorry for
him, and/ in this he1 succeeded, al-
though it was not sorry for him for
the reason that .it should have beeri,
“The Town That Forgot ’ God/’
offered a wonderful opportunity to
produce another picture of the type
of “The Old Nest” but the oppor-
tunity was not grasped; it was over-
done .in places and. underdone in
others. To the-juvenile actor who
played the lead goes, credit for a
large part of what success it did
achieve. —

/ MISS A. R. CARR’S RECITAL
: The first graduate piano recital
in the ’ St. Mary’s Conservatory of
Music this year was given by Miss
Alice Rose Carr, ’25; in St. Angela’s
Hall Tuesday evening, May 22.
Miss Carr’s program was one of
special merit, both in selection and
technique.1 The Scherzo, Tarantelle,
and the’ Prelude by the masters
Beethoven, Rubinstein, and Bach
brought but', her clear “cut"; and bril-
liant technique. . Her delicate ■ren-
dition;of The Spinning Song,, by
Hollander, । gave . proof of unusual
pianistic gift abetted by artistic
skill.
Variety and . contrast .were added
in her • fourth group, by modern
composers, which was thoroughly
enjoyed' by her audience. The cli-
max of the well balanced program
came in the uncommon number,
Bird Song' of. St. .'Francis, by • Liszt,
in which Miss Carr - displayed her
virtuosity,; by fine- phrasings . and
sympathy of tone. .	, .
A .vocal, trio,) made up of' three
members! of the Glee Club, a violin
solo by Miss J.rLecour, and a piano
duet added . variety to'the program.
Miss .Carr,’ added to her . musical
ability,; has a versatility of talents
that' -places^her. above the average
college' student.; Her.; marked apti-
tude’ for languages, her-. logical
mind, - and her sincerity, of purpose
point to a womanhood of culture
and splendid accomplishments. '	■
The acclamation off the students
greeted; .her when she -appeared ;for
her first number. . She was, becom-
ingly, attired in a simple: gown of
green canton crepe. Her corsage
of fspring flowers .was sent by her
classmates. The stage was : beau-
tifully, decorated in baskets of pink
roses and; peonies.	. ' ■
Her mother, . Mrs.' Charles A.
Carr, of Sugar’ Grove, >O.,; and her
sister; Mrs. Harry, E. Johnson, , and
small son, Richard, from Two Har-
bors, Minn;, were, present. .
The program:
• When all .'the..windows of the soul- •
Are Rrimed with clinging dust, of care, .
And pent-up fledgling thoughts , look out .
■ Upon a world.no longer/fair;
f The cleansingfrain'of music,comes—-

Sheehan , Injured; Enright or

nounce Games
. . The Notre Dame baseball. taem
• leaves Thursday night for a short
Western trip without the services
of Bill Sheehan, hard hitting short-
stop. Sheehan/ who has been play-
ing good ball, broke a finger on his
left hand , in practice at Northwest-
. ern. He played the game through
and it was not' discovered that his
finger was broken until after the
• - . game; Coach Halais has been work-
ing the past week to fill his position
for the hard games with Knox and
Iowa. Kane- will be moved from
third to shortstop and/either Ver-'
gara or Enright will be at the hot
: ’ corner. It is likely that Enright,
’ -.who has been playing fast Interhall
■ball, will play the position. . •	.
' Curtin, who has been out of the
■ game with'an injured finger is now
in shape’to play and it is possible
. that he will catch one of the games.
• Coach Halas announces that there
may be some changes • in the out-
field unless there is a decided im-
■provement in hitting. Kelly has
been showing up well in practice
and' is giving the present regulars
a hard run for their .positions. ’	;
■ The Irish will play Knox College
on Friday in Galesburg, Ill. Knox
. has .a good team and.is at present
. laeding, the Little Nine conference
with a clean record. / Magevney will
• probably pitch against Knox. Al-
. , though Knox has. a good team it’ is
expected that Notre Dame will beat
. .them Friday. The Halasmen will
leave Galesburg immediately after
. the Knox game for Iowa City to
battle the University of- Iowa. • No-
tre Dame- looks for a tough battle
with Sam Barry’s slugging crew.
Everyone recalls the game with
Iowa here some days ago’when they
were defeated by the splendid work
of Falvey, 1-0, in twelve, innings.
The .Hawkeyes, will try desperately
to~even the~count. 'EitrfeiTTalvey
or Castner will pitch against Iowa.
If Falvey pitches it is possible; that
Coach Barry, of Iowa, will allow
Becker to pitch against Notre Dame
again. This-will result in another
pitchers’ battle if both pitchers .dis-
play the same effectiveness as they
• did some weeks ago; /
' Nevt.week Notre Dame plays, two
hard games at home. Purdue plays
' here on Tuesday, May. 29,. and Mich-.,
igan plays at Cartier Field on Me-
, morial Day. The Boilermakers
have been travelling at a, fast clip
and expect to give the Irish a tough
; battle. - Notre Dame’won a game
- from Purdue eralier/in the season
,	- when. Falvey held them to three
hits and shut them out. Michigan
ha sa, victory over Notre Dame, 11-
. ‘ 10 in ten jnnings, to its credit, but,

the score on Decoration Day. ' ,
