To Form Monogram
, Club of Debaters
At a meeting of the members of
this year’s debating team which will
be held tomorrow noon, final plans
will be made for the definite or-
ganization of varsity debaters into
a Monogram Debaters’ club.-
After a t series of previous meet-
ings, at which preliminary arrange-
ments were consideed, it was de-
cided by this year’s orators to form
a permanent society of past and
present debaters. The present
purposes of the organization will
be to decide upon a standard in-
signia to be awarded each year’ to
members .of the debating team, ■ and
have that insignia made a perma-
nent one; to devise means of sup-
plying all past debaters with -the
insignia decided upon;, to hold an
annual commencement banquet at
which all present and past debaters
will, assemble each year; and to
make a fraternal organization of
alumni debaters.	~
If arrangements cari.be made in
time the first annual banquet of
the society will be held <’ ’ ~
-coming --Tvnn^ieeinentr^
time the../project will be formally
launched^'and it is'hoped 'to have
present a good representation. .

John Erskine. Duffield and Com-
pany, New York. $1.50.
We are now much concerned over
our contemporary literature and its
kind; we are frequent readers' of
criticisms of our naturalistic sex
literature;, such articles fill an im-
mense amount of space in our lit-
erary reviews, so that now, at least,
the point of view on this subject
of one of the leading American
critics, how a professor > of English
at Columbia, is, at any rate, inter-
esting. Mr. Erskine does not use
so forceful and surprising phrases
in “The Literary Discipline” as in
some of his earlier books, but he
knows his thesis and states it with
convincing fervor. Charles । Board-
man Hawes, in reviewing the book,
says that it and Stevenson’s “Learn-
ing to Write”* should be. in the
hands of every college senior of
literary bent, and, if only' in: the
hands of every such senior for the
mere culling of the opinions there
expressed, it surely should. A' man

PRINCETON, N. J., May 30.—
The beer suit custom, which has re-
ceived so much prominence of late,
has been found, upon investigation,
novt to have originated in the dark
past but to be a comparatively re-
cent acquisition to undergraduate
life of Princton university. As far
as can be ascertained, the beer suit
owes its origin to several of the
more prominent members of the
class of 1912.
These men, it is said,, seemed to
have trouble as they quaffed the
foam from their beer-mug, in keep-
ing said foam from falling upon,
and making unseemly spots upon
their clothing. This unfortunate
state of affairs brought them to the
conclusion that blue overalls ought
to be worn while drinking. These
men, who were called the “Swiss
Navy,“ were immediately supported
by theii* classmates with great en-
thusiasm.1 The next spring. prac7
tically all o fthe class of 1913 fol-
lowed suit, and the term “beer suit”
was applied to the overall and
jacket. ’	•
The next year white overalls in-
stead of blue became the vogue and
this was kept up throughout the
war. Designs were not thought of
until after prohibition when the
class of 1919 wo^e black bands
placed on the arm in token of
loving rememberance.. The class of
1920 wore two of the then.familiar
service stripes on the left cuff, and
a winged beer-mug was the emblem
for 1921, and a flask surpocket was
worn the following year, while 1923
had a picture of the tiger giving
chase to, a camel. The familiar
bomb inside a horse shoe which is
being worn now, is left for con-
temporary interpretation. .
What Others Say
' IT IS BECOMING NECESSARY. .
' At Columbia University' the .commencement day committee, has
' unanimously, passed resolutions asking’students and alumni to observe>
the prohibition law during aluffini celebration next week. ..The resolu-
tions asked-the alumni to co-operate in “sub-ordinating personal prefer-
ences to regard for the fair name of the university.” ,	, -. f ■
, ‘ It is becoming necessary to take such action. .The problem of;
promiscuous drinking at. university and college affairs must, be - met
squarely..’ Leaving out of consideration entirely, the question of the.’
reputation of particular schools, the. reputation' of.zcollege men and
women is.at stake.	:	; ..	.	, <	, ' . ; 1- , ; .
College people are looked upon in their communities as leaders
in the world. If they disregard the highest law of the land; the United
States constitution, with utter impunity, they will'soonlose that esteem
in the minds of their fellow citizens. It is nd longer a question
' for particular/ schools. It is a problem, of all Colleges and of all
college men and women. .'	,	.	' .‘	'
is certain to benefit from reading it.
' Mr. Erskine does' not. speak di-
rectly of morality in:-literature;-but

for morality, literary decorum. He

PACIFISTS AND SCHOOL BOOKS. .
The pacifist movement which, is gaining a 'foothold in certain
v / sections^ of the country has not:. been particularly alarming. The
. 1 development in the group toward the revision of school textbooks; is,
; however, a move which will bear, watching.z	•
' In this respect the pacifists are exhibiting some keen forethought.
■ If, they-can succeed in. revising, the textbooks they will succeed in
influencing, thought in the grade and high schools,-and their poisonous

to their being journalism, that hu-
man nature in the long run is the’
reaT judge, of literature. He also
takes, occasion to join the many .who
are censoring the censors and says
that: “in the long run the books
of the .highest decency hold their
place’’in fame by crowding out the
others. The public supresses in-
decent books by reading ' decent
ones. . It takes a long time, but
why hot hasten the process by call-

intsead, of delaying, it by advertis-
ing ,the bad?” ;	/ /
Some of his .subjects are decency
in ‘ literature;' originality in liter-
ature; the cult of the natural; the
cult of the-contemporary; and .the
characters proper to literature.

Year Marks Passing
of Many Irish Stars
The close of the 1923-24'school
year marks the passing of men and
achievements' which have figured
; largely in Notre. Dame’s athletic
prominence. ■ From the opening of
the .-school year, in the fall when
-Coach Rockne and Harvey Brown
were making preparations for the
football season till the ninth in-
ning of the last game at commence-
ment, the work of Notre Dame’s
athletes on and off the playing field
has .invoked the undying praise of
a nation of discriminating critics.
Each year Notre Dame sends a
great coterie of men into the world
who have in no small measure added
to :. the athletic prestige of their
Alma Mater by their inimitable
deeds with the Fighting Irish teams
upon the playing field. This year
their, goes, forth another class in
whose ranks are men who have, giv-
en their best while serving with the
Blue and Gold. The captains,
Harvey Brown, Gene Mayl, Paul
Kennedy, Bill Sheehan and Danny
McGowan will long be remembered
in the athletic annals of Notre Dame
for the unquenchable, spirit they
inspired in , their teams.
With; Harvey Brown , goes Gene
Oberst, George Vergara, John Nop-
i penberger, Robert Reagan, Gene
Mayl, Frank Reese, Joe Bergman,
Willie Maher , and . Tim Murphy. As
Coach Rockne said at the close of
the' season, “We are' losing sonie
mighty fine boys.” ' Into their places
■ ! will step many men who have al-
ready served two , years on the
Notre Dame eleven, and the prob-
lem'of many years standing will be
up for solution again next fall:
Where does.Rockne get such teams?
Baseball like basketball will not
suffer as heavy a toll as the other
major sports. For the most part,
Coach Keogan’s diamond squad is
made up of sophomores. Captain
Sheehan,' George Vergara, Hugh
Magevney, Frank McGrath and
Frank Reese will wear the Irish
uniform for the last time in the
commencement game with the Mich-
igan Aggies. These .five men have
filled their time in college baseball
and they can leave the squad know-
ing that they have given their best
to the. Blue and dold.
The boxing squad will lose the
inimitable Danny McGowan. Owing
largely to his efforts, boxing at
Notre Danie gained greater promin-
ence in the calender of local sports
this year than ever before. The
clever little flyweight has boxed his
way through numerous amateur
titles and stood as one of the big
point getters on the Notre Dame
ring squad. He leaves after him
several jmen who gave a splendid
account of themselves during that
time that the boxing team was ac-
tive in intercollegiate competition.
Miller, Canny, Schell, Springer,
Scherer and Moore will be on deck
for the squad that will take up, the
game again next year.
The minor sports of hockey and
swimming are numbered at the bot-
tom of the list of passing athletes.
The hockey squad loses Jimmy Egan
and Norm Feltes. A-
The prospects for the athletic
year 1924-25 are remarkably at-
tractive in that -with a great deal
of veteran material already on hand,
the coaches will have a promising
group coming in from the yearling
teams of this year. The football
season will dawn as brilliantly as
ever .with a schedule that will eclipse

Notre Dame Entered
In Conference Meet
The University of Notre‘ Dame
will be represented among the 14
non-conference schools that will
participate in the annual outdoor
western conference track meet to
be held at the University- of Chi-
cago, June 6 and 7. This number,
coupled with the ten conference
schools, brings the total to 24. , -
Among the non-conference schools
who will seek team honors in the
Big Ten cinder classic will be Wa-
bash, Ames, Butler, Michigan Ag-
gies, .Western State Normal and
Oberlin. Several of the , outside
schools entered boast of star per-
formers who will give the best men
in the conference ranks closer com-
petition than was displayed in many
.of the Big Ten dual meets. Gray
of Butler will be able to stand up
against the sprint men of Illinois,
Michigan and Iowa. -The Normal
school has .a good quarter, miler in
Smith, ’ while Ames has a hurdler
that pushed Brookins in the Iowa-
Ames dual meet. Notre Dame will
enter a'squad.of seven men, which
will probably include some of the
following: Kennedy, Luke Walsh,
Harrington, Livergood, Barr, Lay-
den, McTiernan, Barber, Cox,
Wendland, Oberst and Milbauer.
From past performances, Illinois
is due to take a huge slice of the
team honors. Gill has a pair of
record breakers in the sprints,
notably Evans,' who will lead any
man in the conference a merry
race. Evans has twice tied Pad-
dock’s' world record in the 200
meter fun. Michigan will have ।
Wittman, Brooker-and DeHart Hub-
bard to contribute for points while ...
Gill will have Brownell, Angiers,
Hall and Meigher.
GRID MEN WRESTLE
URBANA, Ill. — Linemen may
find Illinois guards and tackles
rather stiff bucking if Coach Zup-
ke’s method of training is put into
practice next fall. The Orange and
Blue mentor has most of the fresh-
men t^am of this year out working
on Coach Prehri’s wrestling squad.

The close of the season finds
Notre Dame in possession of the

share in the baseball title and a
healthy bid for the golf title.
