(Special).—After leading the Uni-
versity of Michigan for seven in-
ningst ,: eight . errors : and frigid
weather contributed ’to Note/Dame’s
second defeat at the hands of a
confence school when the Wolver-
ines dropped the. Irish, 9 to 6 on
Ferry field here Thursday.
,	. Although the Note Dame nine
grabbed its customary lead by ham-
mering in two runs in the opening
frame, the cold weather made good
ball playing an impossibility and
with the score tied in the eighth,
.misplays- .by Notre Dame aided
Michigan in scoring four funs. The
cold air affected the pitchers of
both teams, the Irish registering
ten hits off Shoesmith of Michigan.
Stryker, the Wolverine ace, was in-
jected into the game in the clos-
ing innings. / . ', .

' meant a run.* The'Notre Dame
hurler was not pitching in his usual
.form and eight Wolverine batsmen

MEMORIAL TO WAR
HEROES DEDICATED
FATHER WALSH SPEAKS BE-
FORE- FIELD MASS; COL.
HOYNES LEADS PARADE
As a memorial to the 46 Notre
Dame men who lost their lives .in
the service during the World War,
Father Matthew Walsh,, president
of the university, yesterday morriing '
dedicated the memorial entrance to.
Sacred Heart church. .
The dedication ceremony was a
part of the Memorial Day observ-
ance on the campus, and took place.
pt'8:30 o’clock in the morning, pre-
ceding the reading of a military field
mass by Father Walsh.	' , . ,
The memorial entrance is of white
stone and is at present about half ’
completed. The arch of the en- :
trance will contain .the words “For
God, for - country and for' Notre
Dame.” On the sides of the door-'
way will be inscribed the names'of /	x
the 46' Notre Daine.men who died .
during, the war.
|	' Talks On Patriotism. :
“The list of 46 men represents .
the greatest death rate for the nu^- .
ber of students enrolled of any col-
lege , ’in. the United States,” . said -
Father Walsh in his.dedicatory ad-
dress.. “Two thousand and five
hundred of our. limited number re- >
sponded. . When you look oyer that
group ybu see the universality of
it. ■ Almost every race and nation- /
ality is represented. ' r
“The real purpose of a memorial, <
from the Catholic point of view,
is to inspire a prayer for those we
desire ;to remember. It is very._____
proper -that this,'memorial should
be a part, of the Church; of Notre ’
Dame.	;	.
“No one who knows Notre Dame
need, be told of the spirit of loyalty^
and' faith that., has animated ; this
university from its beginning. We \
should imitate our dead in that they
have shown us the lesson of patriot-
ism. If only the people of America -
would follow' their . example' there ‘
would be no discrimination because ■
of race or creed.- When Washing- :
ton said that .religion and morality
are the basis of patriotism he gave *
us the definition to every patriotic !
move, at Notre Dame. .	. ■ ■; / '
“It'is to the. boys .of the World
War. and to the men / of the Civil - .
War that this memorial is dedicated.,’.
Let us ask: God that this memorial
will, not only be beauty in stone, but ’
also a/reminder to pray, for the
men; to whom it’ is dedicated?’ ,
!( The dedication was to have been,
by- Very Rev. Charles L. O’Donnell, '
provincial of the order, but he was
unable to be present. Following
the dedication Father Walsh read
the military field mass after which :
a. parade to the" cemetery was led
by Col. William Hoyries, veteran of
the Civil War arid' former dean of
the law school, and his aid, Lewis. J.
J. .Murphy, who served as lieuten- \
ant with the ' 6th Marines during
the World War. ' •.	.

In the parade were the Notre ' ;

THE DAILY’S STAND FOR NOTRE DAME
A union building to be built as soon as possible.
. A well-organized student body, residing on the campus.
, True recognition of good'scholarship and a better appreciation
for the efforis of men in campus activities.
The Daily publishes in another
column a communication in support
of the Ku Klux Klan. The gist of
the writer’s argument is that the
Catholic church—a close-knit organ-
ization -which- makes abundant use.
of ritual—is gaining a large mea-
sure of temporal control, and that
the, Klan—also an organization
which makes use of ritual for the
purpose of gaining and holding
members—is organized to rid tem-
poral affairs of the menace of Ca-
tholicism. Since it has certain fea-
tures in common with the Catholic
church, the writer implies, its ex-
istence is excusable.	'
The writer’s argument is based on
a fallacy: namely, that the two or-
ganizations are in any degree com-
parable. True, they jboth make use
of ritual to a large extent in hold-
ing, their followers. But there; is
one element characteristic of the
: THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY. -■
The news reels of the theatres recently showed pictures of the mov-
ing of'the-small town of-Reno, Tex., (located six miles east of Paris,
Tex;, from beside a railroad over which but four trains passed each
day,'to a concrete highway a half mile away. The railroad lost its pres-
tigc and business value to the town because there was a steady stream
/ of traffic passing over the highway. . >
Klan -which has nd place in the
Church—that of secrecy. The
speaker at. the Ku Klux Klan meet-
’ It was only a small town, and it did not' take much to move its
three business houses and the few residences that there were. The only
thing that was left behind was a swimming pool which could not very
" ' well be transported. * Since it has been over on the highway they have
‘put up a couple of more stores, and the;real estate business is beginning
to boom. '	~	...........	-	L
.. Not, very long ago a farmer became very excited when he heard
‘ that the railroad was “dickering” for a-right of way through liis dis-
trict. He became very anxious to have the surveyors go over his land
and find it the most suitable cut in the vicinity.. Nowadays however, the
farmer works to have the state legislature put concrete o nthe old road
in front of the farmhouse so that the world wilt pass his front door.
' It looks as though the .day of the steel highway was. over, and the
concrete highway was here. It will bind the sections of the country
more closely together, for where one brakeman stopped befqre, a score
- of motorists will now offer.a cheery “Hello !”
ing, recently held in Ann Arbor,
laid especial stress on the need for
secrecy in the working of the Klan.
He said that without it the Klan
could not hope to. accomplish its
aims. And the Catholic church^ no
matter what other criticism may be
leveled at it, can not be accused
of securing >its ends through the
use of secrecy.	.	. : .
The Klan preaches “American-
ism,”, and claims a basis in the
Constitution, . yet its whole—organic,
zation is founded.on a proposition
which is fundamentally unconstitu-
tional. The first tenet of American
government is obedience to the law;
and the basis for the constitution
of the United States is individual
liberty. Yet the Klan attempts to
bring about obedience by extra-
legal methods; it takes the law into
its own hands. In spite of asser-
tions to the contrary, 'this has been
proved time and gain, in the var-
ious Klan outrages in Texas, Louis-
iana, and Alabama. There are - in-
stances bn record in which the Klan
has> attempted to enforce the liquor
laws by1 taking alleged violators
out and tar-and-feathering them.
In many instances the Klan has
served out deserved punishment.
But the fact remains that any or-
ganization which attempts to mete
out punishment -without recourrse to
law, will run amuck. It is too much
of a temptation to' allow .the per-
sonal element to interfere, and to
DISOBEYING THAT IMPULSE.
The impulse to sneeze is one that is commonly regarded, as practi-:
cally irresistible. Many writers even make the inopportune, but un-
controllable, sneeze the means of causing revelations which are necessary
for the development of the story.; And in spite of the universal condem-
, nation of the sneeze on the grounds of both hygiene and social conduct,
the sneezers are still with lis; ,	. .	.
/ Yet a French physician, Dr. Paul Farez, asserts that the sneeze
can usually be prevented in an easy manner, and gives numerous meth-
ods of such prevention; Incidentally, Dr. Farez believes that the stop-
ping of the sneeze is'desirable rather in conformity with the laws of
’ good society , than as hygienic measure. Consequntly he considers his
suggestions from the viewpoint of their1 practicabilityin society. Thus
- the effective remedy of yawning miist be- abandoned because, the yawn
is regarded as impolite as the sneeze. Likewise whistling, which is an-
■ other effective means of restraining the sneeze, is. considered ill-bred. '
>	' But the doctor has many other, suggestions to offer; Among them
; is the one advanced by the■ ancient philosopher, Aristotle;'namely, to rub
: the nose or the eyesContracting the muscles of the forehead, eyebrows
• - 'and face has been.tried witli-succes. by.some.. ^Pinching the skin.violent-
ly or. thrusting a fingernail in the palm of the hand have been strongly
recommended. Pressing the upper lip, just below the nose, with a finger
- is at once a most effective and unoffending way of. oyercoming the “ir-
‘ resistible” impulse. - .	y	.
.The secret: of the success of these artifices seems to lie in the fact
that. they bring the individual into'a stage of expectant attention, so
' that the. breathing is suspended and the diaphragm is immobilized.! In
' other words, the play of the-diaphragm is indirectly, but deliberately
' : controllediby the imposition of a sort of discipline.' And since the sneeze
- Js nothing more than the result of a violent contraction of the diaphragm
expelling the air. from the lungs, it may be prevented by controlling
; the involuntary action of the diaphgram; and tjiis control may be exert-
\ ed by substituting a new rhythm for the one which ordinarily ends in a
■ ,z sneeze. .Thus, holding the breath is the important thing; .and the. sev-
• eral. plans suggested by Dr; Feraz', and many others, are merely ways
/ of producing ,the concentrated attention necessary to immobilize the dia-
phragm.' : . —	• ■-■»,-
With the-suppression of the sneeze being such-a simple matter,'
. ; society is surely justified in expectinglts suppression in public. But on
. the other hand sneezing is nature’s method, of releiving an. irritation
and hence: its coinplete suppression would be undesirable. :	,
- Consequently sneezing apparently is but another problem in the
. eternal: controversy between private inclination; and. public demands.
, Evidently the-individual must compromise by. exercising his powers of
' self control except .in the privacy, of his room where the impulse may
- be. safely regarded as irresistible.	.	.	, <

make use of the Klan’s enormous
power for the avenging of individ-
ual grievances.
The case of the Texas Klan is
typical.* It was originally composed
of the leaders in various commun-
ities—clergymen, professional men,
and prominent business men—and
while it was in the hands of these
people there were no instances in
which; it made ill use of its powers.
But as it grew another element
began to creep in. , Outrages were
committed in the name of the Klan,
outrages which had never had the
sanction of the true body. And
the Klan itself began to come under
grave suspicion. Municipal and
state government was disorganized.
It became impossible to administer
justice, because the courts were
filled with Klan judges,’ Klan pros-
ecuting -attorneys, Klan sheriffs,
Klan everything. Anybody not a
Klansman ,had small chance of get-
ting a square deal. ■	_____
There is, of course, no place for
such an. organization in a country
which aspires to democracy. The
one great advantage of democracy
is that it puts everything out in the
open. It gives opportunity for dis-
cussion of both sides of the ques-
tion. It gives dirty things a healthy
airing, and allows Right to speak
for itself. In an organization in
which its own good is the primary
consideration, and where everything
must be sacrificed for an arbitrary
principle, the underlying airh which
is democracy’s raison d’etre—that
of finding the .truth—has small
chance for existence.—Michigan

Notre Dame Golfers
Drop Indiana, 11-9
After 'completing the morning
round in a tie with the University of
Indiana golf team, the Notre Dame
quartet won out in the afternoon
round over the Crimson visitors, 11
to 9, on the Chain o’ Lakes course
Thursday afternoon. The decisive
win entitles the Irish golfers to lay
claim to the Indiana state title.
The count for the morning round
ended at ,5 all. Adams lost two
points’ to Engstrom and Foglia
dropped. three points to Redding,
but Ward picked up two points
in winning over Brouwer and Bul-
ger defeated .Utely, the captain of
the Crimson 'team, 3 -to - 0;-— The
match .between Adams and Eng-
strom was the feature performance
of the morning round.
Adams and Ward playing for
Notre Dame in the best ball four-
some of the afternoon round scored
a brilliant victory over Engstrom
and Brouwer of .the Indiana squad,
6 to 0. Bulger-and Foglia lost to
Utely and Redding in the other best
ball foursome, 4 to 0. The work
of‘the Notre Dame players in ,the
afternoon was decidedly above par
and over-lapped the best efforts of
the Indiana team. Jack Adams of
Notre Dame turned in the low medal
card for the afternoon round of
75< Engstrom of Indiana was next
with a 78 in the morning round.
The victory marks the fourth
straight win in five starts. Notre
Dame has won over'DePaul, Loyola
and Culver, and lost to Nothwest-
ern by the • margin of one point'.
DePaul after losing to the Notre
Dame team, entered the Western
Interstate golf tournament at Du-
buque and won team honors. Notre
Dame has one more match j on the’
1924 card. The DePaul .team will
play on the Chain o’.Lakes course,

CARPENTIER MIX TODAY
Michigan City, Ind., May 30,
(Special)—Numbered among the
several thousand fight fans who will
witness the Gibbons-Carpentier ten-
round no decision boxing contest to
be staged here this afternoon will
be a large delegation of Notre Dame
students.	. .
The several weeks of training in
which both boxers engaged in pre-
paration, for the first notable ring
contest “on the 1924 boxing pro-
gram has been completed and to all
indications the contestants are in
the best of condition. The work
outs of the last few days have great-
ly impressed the ring followers who
have been . in attendance, at the
camp for the past ten days. Car-
pentier is pictured in a new light by
all the gentlemen of the wagering
fraternity and his workouts have
gained for him a large number of
followers who were ready to stake
all on Tommy Gibbons.
Speed . has characterized . the
work of- Capentier who has been
cutting loose with almost every-
thing in store against his sparring
partners. The Frenchman’s man-
agers have been obliged to caution
the idol of Paris against wearing
himself out before the gong opens
the international mixer. He is re-
garded as being.in even better con-
dition than he .was the day he step-
ped into the roped arena with Demp-
sey. “Carp” is wearing, a leather
headgear in practice to protect his
ears from rasping punches. -
Gibbons - has spent much of his
time figuring out a plan of battle
which he- intimated to newspaper
men last night would call for close-
in fighting. The American has
carefully weighed Carpentier’s fa-
mous long range fighting style and
is well aware of all the dangers

Four Games- Remain
on Baseball Slate
Four more games remain to be
played on Notre Dame’s baseball
schedule, Wisconsin, Michigan Ag-
gies, Western Normal and the Mich-
igan Aggies in order. The success
of the season, which has been built
up on the string, of eight victories
over conference schools, will be cli-
maxed insofar as the Big Ten com-
petition is concerned, with the Wis-
consin game at Madison next Tues-
day afternoon.
Two games dropped to conference
teams, Iowa and Michigan, have
been evened, Notre Dame" having
split the home and .home series. The
lo?s.tb Michigan,, which was as un-
expected as was the overwhelming
defeat of Illinois, cannot be counted
on real ball playing. Errors, of
course, hold a prominent place in
every game and every ball club,
regardless of its. past performances,
is “tough” just before the game.
Every conference victory on, the
Cartier field diamond was earned
by runs, but the Michigan game
was lost on errors.
On paper and on the field, Notre
Dame still holds the edge over con-
ference baseball teams. Of the
schools that were not carded, on
Notre Dame’s schedule, Chicago
made little showing in the confer-
ence and held an undisputed place
at the bottom' of the list. Purdue

split a series with Wisconsin and
gave the ,Badgers a nip and tuck
battle in both games. Ohio State
cut a huge figure in the conference
by taking a sudden rise during the
middle of the season, incidently de-
feating Illinois when the Suckers
were on on the top shelf. Two
defeats served to keep the State
nine in second place and tied with
Wisconsin in that position.
The Wolverines, taking a new
lease on baseball life, chalked up
seven victories to grab first place
in the conference baseball calender.
A crucial struggle is in the offing
when Wisconsin and Michigan meet
this afternoon. A loss for the Wol-
verines will give the Badgers 50
per cent of the top shelf honors.
A postponed game today will give
Ohio State undisputed title provid-
ing it can take the measure of the
Maroons next week. x
