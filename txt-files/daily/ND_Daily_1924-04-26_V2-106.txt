Read Requiem Mass
for William Dockman
Solemn requiem mass for the
repose of the soul of William A.
Dockman. of “Baltimore, university
student who was killed recently,
was to be read at 6:15 o’clock
this morning in Sacred 'Heart
church by Rev. Hugh O’Donnell.
Dockman died after having both
liriibs. amputated below the knees
when he, was run over by a train
on April 17, at Greenwood, Ky. The
tragedy occurred during the East-
er recess while' he was traveling
through. Kentucky in company "with
William Conway of Holyoke, Mass.;
who lives in Freshman hall. Be-
cause of the scarcity of automo-
bile traffic they attempted’to board
a freight train at Greenwood at
8:30 o’clock on. Thursday.
: Dockman stumbled while secur-
ing a hold on the car -which he
was attempting to board. and fell,
the wheels passed over both limbs.
A doctor, who was near assisted
in stopping the flow of blood and
the student was’taken to .the Col-
lege street infirmary, in Somerset,
Ky- Here . he was operated upon
after being. prepared for death by.
the Rev. John. N. Fallon, the priest
in charge. Although he rallied, the
loss of blood which he had suffered
proved too much. and he ‘ died at
2:30 in the afternoon. ■	'
. Although under severe pain,
Dockman is said to ’ have remained
conscious throughout the ordeal.
Even' when he’ - lay - bleeding, h'e-
extended, his hand to. clasp the palm
of his comrade.', During the per-
iod. in hich he was in the infirm-
ary,.-he talked, of his chances for
playing football during the coming
season.

more than successful both: from the

the improvement in the work of?

RUSHING TO THE END. '	■
The chimes in the steeple have welcomed us back again, many of us
for the .last time as undergraduates, and the school year is speedily
nearing its close. The Easter vacation, last of those delightful recesses,
is over, and an exactng program of daily class work is the-outlook 'un-
til summertime.
‘ In many ways the spring weeks on the campus are the best; The
juadrangle looks its prettiest, there is much,opportunity to get out among
bur fellows,'and for the seniors there is already a feeling of wanting to
tread familiar pathways as often as possible before June ends college
",' > • days. ."	• .	• •	. ..
The baseball games and the track meets, class and club elections,
the junior prom and the senior ball, all must be crowded into a busy six
; . -Weeks, and then commencement. ,	, > •-
The chimes in the steeple are rushing us on! Most of us remeinber
their welcomes, we are glad that they now sound out across campus,
telling7 the hours to the end.
RUTS., ' - .
There are ruts in every road. Even the hard surfaced avenue to^suc-
cess is marred, by the deep indentures of failures'who have guzzled
and waddled along,'smearing as'they went.
The college man is not rut proof! In fact he may even have a
• tendency to get down into one of the/ slots and toil along, unmindful
of his objective, falsely confident in the'fact that he has his alma
mater’s sheepskin somewhere in his . trunk. '	'	7
Esenwein once said in'one of his' epigramatic shorts that "A rut is ,
ri riiiniature grave.. It is better to go bumping ahead over a rough way
than to roll sleepily on digging for our selves, and for. those who follow
a deeper arid deeper grave.” .
Much has been' wrtten, it is true, about ruts. But Joo much may riot
' be written, it is equally true. :	.	‘	.7-	.
Evidence'thrit thousands of ambitious young make the error of tramp-
ing into them bears eloquent testimony to the need of frequent and
pointed lectures on this point of ruts.
‘ Ruts are conditions of the mind: diseases which' breed a certain
erroneous coritentment, disastrous to an eventual attainment of any-
' ' thing worthwhile. Dissatisfaction—in its proper environment—is a
needful virtue. It promotes the spirit and enlivens that tiny germ
plasm in the back of the brain which prompts him however feebly to
better things. ■
\	, WHY THEY QUIT SCHOOL.
.	' For many years economists, sociologists and others have been
attempting to explain why farmers leave the farm, why,young people
leave home, arid similar vexing, problems. Now it is the college admin-
istrators ,wlio are concerned about the question of "student morality.”
Of the .9,025 students who registered at the university of Minnesota
for the 1922-23 college year, 1,659 dropped out voluntarily; In order
to ascertain the^reason .for this if possible, the registrar undertook a
survey. A questionnaire was sent to those students who had left school,
and four out of five made a reply.
The 'ansivers-revealed that about one-fourth of the students left on
account of finances, while, the second leading cause was illness. Trans-
' fer, business,- discouragement and lack of interest werfe other leading
causes. _ , .'7 - ..." - •'	7.. ■
Many more. students dropped out of the first and second year than
in the third or fourth. This was explained as due to the natural weed-
ing out process that occurs in any competition in which large numbers
cake part. The survey at Minnesota, however, also indicated' that thiee
times as many students become ill; in the freshman year as in the junior
- year. . Is this ’merely because homesickness is the strongest in the first
1 year ?', ?Or is it' ^because the students when first . thrown on their i own
r resources are unable to “take care of themselves” properly? Perhaps
a charige of climate would affect some. One Chinese student, for
. - example, answered the Minnesota questionnaire:., “Far too cold* could
not-stand”” .	’
7.: Then again, just what is a “miscellaneous personal reason?” These
applied most frequently to freshmen, while not- affecting a.single junior
and/senior. Evidently a few years: at collegd enable one to know his
own mirid and be more explicit, if nothing else? ■

CONRAD AND THE REPORTERS
By Christopher Morley, Doubleday,
Page & Co.
This is a little volume, written by
Christopher Morley and published
for bookseller friends and other
lovers of Conrad. Only eight hun-
dred and fifteen copies were printed
and the type has been distributed.
The original appeared in the
New York Evening Post in May,
1923, after Mr. Conrad’s arrival in
this country.
As Mr. Morley says himself, “The
gist of the adventure is in the rela-
tion between Conrad and the, re-
porters.” Mr. Morley was one of
the special interviewers to me. Mr.
iConrad as he. came up New York
fHarbor on the “Tuscania” last
■spring, and in his delightful
^entertaining manner, he roams on
:to tell about the novelist’s experi-
ence with the reporters and the
photographers who thronged the
ship. In the matter of method
Mr. Mbrley gives credit' to the
reporters for being “more delicate-
minded souls/’ but of ‘the photog-
raphers, he says, “one does not like
to speak.”
New York harbor; the famous
skyline, and a few sailing - vessels
plying under the boys of the
gigantic Tuscania are all commented
on interestingly. Some ; of ' Mr.
Conrad’s / fellow-passenger^ receive
a few words—particularly Muirhead
Bone the artist, and Captain T)avid
Bone, of the “Tuscania.” Mr. Bone
and Mr. Conrad were cabin mates on
the trip “and had found themselves
to be kinspirits,”zand Captain Bone
and Mr. Conrad had been friends
for years. Mr. Morley revels in
spirit at the thought of Mr. Con-r
rad, “in the exhilaration of finding
himself again at "sea1'arid 'such
corigenial Company, sitting up until
2 o’clock or so every morning, in
a red dressing gown, talking hap-
pily' of art, seamanship, literature
and everything between.”-
It was Captain. Bone, also a
writer who, thirteen years ago,
sent Conrad a copy of “The Brass-
bounder,” then just published, and
sought Conrad’s advice, saying that
he had some thought of leaving

the sea to take up litei’ary pursuits.
Conrad’s answer gives a new and
interesting insight into his attitude
towards his own art, and his love
for the inspiration he was compell-
ed to desert—“Stick to the ship. If
I had known' that -writing would
take me away from the sea, I would
never have published a line.” .
The reporters find Mr. Conrad a
genial subject for their questions
but some of the stories in the pap-

Morley’s high.indignation) an amaz-
ing unfamiliarity with Mr. Conrad’s

Although the gym offers but two
courts to play on, the first round
matches should 'be played off by
the middle of next week in order
that the second round may get un-
der way as soon as possible. The

the remainder of the season be-
cause of a fractured ankle and of
Bert Dunne temporarily, due to
a wrenched ankle. * Both men were

You know tobacco is a vege-

and when it’s green, it is too
harsh and strong to smoke. The.
very 'best way to remove that
harshness and bitterness7 is by
thorough ageing in wood. To

expensive for us—yes, very ex-
pensive, arid it takes time, but it
gives you a milder, cooler smoke
with a finer flavor.
