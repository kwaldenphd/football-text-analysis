Castner and . Tom Lieb form. the
trio that will pilot the Notre Dame
hockey team in its games this year.

ganizing the team.
“ A 1 though^ gr aduatio r db bed <thd‘
team of the majority, of its stars,
Rockne and Father Cunningham
think that there is enough good ma-
terial among the student body to
produce another championship
team. Every man who has skating
ability and a spirit to work is urged
to become a candidate for the team."
. This winter sport was introduced
to the students of Notre Dame four
years ago. During . these, years,
the Irish'have crossed clubs, shaved
ice, and matched with with some of
the most formidable hockey, teams
in the country. In defiance of the
handicaps they battled under, the
Notre Dame skaters' brought' home
the title “Western Champions.”

be present at the meeting Sunday
morning: Franklin McSorley, Nor-
man Feltes, Ted Bullard, Bill. Cer-
ney, Jimmy Stack, Jim Egan, John

S. B. High Alumni
Plan Holiday Dance
What promises to be one of the'
most important social functions ;of.
the South Bend holiday season will
be held on December 26, when-the
South Bend High School Alumni
Association holds its annual infor-
mal ball at the Palais Royale. Sey-
mour Simons’ orchestra; .which has
already won considerable popular-
ity in this region, has been engaged
to play the . program of' dances
scheduled from 9 to 1 o’clock.
By arrangement'with the S. A. C.,
an invitation has been extended by
. the* committee in charge to all
Notre Dame students who will be in
South Bend over the holidays. For
the purpose of reaching such men
of Notre Dame as may want to at-
tend the dance, • tickets have been
placed in the hands of Richard
Zilky, president. of The Villagers;
Charles Baumgartner . and Paul
Butler, .all of Avhomrare alumni of
the local: school. Any student de-
siring to attend the dance, who is
unable to ,get in touch, with any of
these three, men, .may call Miss Ber-
nice Clark at the South Bend High
School.
Over fifty patrons and patronesses
have already given their support to

Confound it! As the poet says:
"This winter’s weather it waxeth

And frost it freezeth on every hill,
And Boreas blows his ' blast so

Confound it! I had hoped that we
would have summer all winter.

And I have another cause for
grievance, unless the kindly Jup-
iter Pluvius, as the sport writers
say, turns his sprinkling can on
this fond earth today.
During the rain of the week, I

And a little later 'that same day,

But a sight, from the window, of
Claude Pitsenberger’s new mus-

sentimental reminiscences to more
serious things. We might again
scold the scouts who send in- un-
signed reports, and those whose
ideas of humor are preverted, and
• who write matter , suited better ei-
ther for “The Fiery Cross” or
; 'The Hot Dog” than for a column
whose intent is kindly' fun, and
which doesn’t mean td hurt or of-
Jend. Put feather on the pointed
end of your darts, scouts, so that
they tickle rather than prick".

W' and then, perhaps, your
Misadventures are unthinking, due,
sometimes to the soporific influence
°f long hours of study, as perhaps,

Of Jonson on “whiffle,” and the con-
. hasting opinions of Schlegel and
Schopenauer and Pilsener, that the
term was . “whafflle,” or perhaps,, in
extreme cases, “whoofle,” he wan-
deredup one ’ extra flight. ; Great

great was his intended wrath, when

bed that John thought , was his.

and an angered John would be dan-

Daily Subscribers
Are Increasing
Another increase in the subscrip-
tion list of the DAILY as a result
of the student convocation held a
week ago, has been announced. In
last Tuesday’s edition it was said
that no -report on the increase
among the Day-Dodgers was avail-
able. The increase was to the
amount of 43 new subscribers.
At present there are 275 men'
living off-campus who have sub-
scribed to the DAILY, and 195 men
who have not as yet subscribed:
This brings the total increase to
203. , A good number of subscrip-
tions are expected before the drive
is over.
IRISH QUINTET
MEETS ARMOUR
Play Fifst Home Game at South
Bend Y. M, G. A. Tonight;
Koegan’s Men Are Ready.
In the first home game of the
season, the Notre Dame basket ball
team will meet the Armour quintet
of Chicago in the South Bend Y. M.
C. A. gym this evening.
. Koegan’s men have had but two
weeks’ training for the start of’the
season, during which time they jour-
neyed to Minneapolis and split a
two-game series with the Gophers;
they are in fine shape for the game,
however, and are confident of win-
ning. Last year the Notre Dame
squad had an easy victory over the
Chicago boys, but they have always
been a fast and dangerous team,
and tonight’s game should prove a
test of the merit of the Notre Dame
-squad——	—
Captain Mayl and his team have
a; rather tough- schedule ahead of
them, but with the wealth of. mater-
ial that is on hand for the season,
the outlook is much; brighter than
it has been for several seasons past.
Crowe, Enright, Miller, Riordan,
Mayl, Walsh, Mahoney, and Kizer
are all men whose worth have been
proved; there are undoubtedly some
who are capable among those men
who have not yet had the chance to
prove themselves; and it is expected
that tomorrow’s game will give some
of these their opportunity.
Welsh to Fight
Here Tuesday
: The senior class boxing show un-
der the direction of Danny Mc-
Gowan, which will be staged in the
Nbtre ’ Dame . gym next Tuesday
night, has been recarded in order
that another feature bout might be
entered oh the list. Eddie Walsh,
who appeared in the-University last
year, was signed yesterday to meet
Art Canny, clever Irish battler, in
the double windup. The other fea-
ture bout will be a fast’ four-round
mixer between Joe .Sharkey of
South Bend and Johnny Herman,
the St. Paul flash. : The blonde
- scrapper is in fine fettle \for the
match and is due to give the vis-
itor from the copper country four
rounds of fast entertainment.
Charley Springer, amateur mid-
dleweight'champion of Notre Dame,
will swap punches with Young
O’Brien, another product of the
Irish glove team. Springer, 'who
hails from Bellaire, Ohio, made his
debut in the sportlight; at Notre
Dame last spring when he fought on
the Irish boxing team,’ and won the
amateur middleweight champion-
ship at the Chicago tournament.
Jack Spillane will mix it for three
rounds with. Young O’Keefe, Spil-
lane was formerly carded to meet
Dave Popp of South'Bend, but'in
the recasting of the bouts, Spillane
was scheduled with O’Keefe.
The-new program follow’s:	s
Eddie Welsh, South: Be^nd, vs;

rounds.,..............    .

IRISH SWIMMERS
LOSE MEET, 42-25
Notre Dame Wins in Only Three
Events; Andorhurg and Schutt
Are Stars. •
The Notre Dame swimming team
lost their first meet of the season
last night to the Flying Squadron .
at the Municipal Natatorium by the
score of 42 to 25. Notre Dame took
only three firsts out of a possible
eight. Due to a rather doubtful de-
cision on the fancy diving contest,
the Irish lost three points. Ander-
burg and Schutt shared the hon-
ors of the meet, each taking two
first places. Although- the Notre
Dame team lost by an overwhelm-,
ing score, some excuse can be made
because of the short time that the
collegians have had to train. In-
tensive training is to be the program
after Christmas and great things
are expected of the squad.'

Dr. Mercier Talks
To French Circle
“The Revival of Catholicism
Among the Intellectuals in France”
was the subject of a lecture given
by Doctor. MJercier at a regular
meeting of the French club last
night. •	'	'	'
‘ Doctor. Mercier, who spent last
summer in France, spoke largely.
from personal observation. His re- . ,
cent close contact with the more
aristocratic French people enabled __ .
him to give an especially informa-
tive address. ■	>	. ' /
Many-who were not members of
the French club took advantage of
the opportunity to hear Doctor
Mercier through the club’s general
invitation. . .
Freshmen Addressed
By Dean Konopy
Dean Konop of the Law School
gave a lecture on “Education for
the Bar” at the weekly <freshman
convocation in Washington hall,
last Thursday noon.
• The speaker pointed out the ad-
vantages one would derive from the
study of law. No matter what-the
profession, he said, every one.needs
and should have a training in law.
The purpose of education is not to
store the mind with facts, but to
train the rniind' to think. Law, he
declared, is an ideal study for that
purpose. ■ - /	'	-X
The speaker went on to state that x
the purpose of school work was mot
only to impart knowledge, but :
also to make men of the
students of the- university. - This, .is
especially true of Notre Dame, he - .
said, where the Students are trained
intellectually, physically and'moral-
ly; the combination of which pro-
duces men able to i take up their
world work unhindered by any dif-
ficulties.	’ -

Editor NOTRE DAME DAILY:
Accept my congratulations on
the DAILY’S “scoop” over the
South Bend, papers in the matter of
the game with Wisconsin next year.
It was in Sunday’s DAILY that
I first learned that the game is to
be played on next year’s schedule,
and it was again the DAILY that
corrected a false report that the
game would not be included on the
list of games.
Our DAILY, has proved itself re-
liable..

Meeting of the S. A. C. Sunday’morning

To the X. Y. Z.’s of Sorin (who-
ever you are), through the
Editor, NOTRE DAME-DAILY:
Not by way of “putting the stu-
dent body right” on a vodvil that is
past, but rather in reply (in which
the changing of initials tb names
is unnecessary) to the personal
criticism of the Palace review, I
.pen these apologetic words.
After re-reading both letter and
review I find that, we differ only
in the last line—liking the show.
And after reading the review “of
unsophisticated theatrego ezrs”
(though you “have not missed many
shows at the Palace since its open-
ing last November, (1922),” I
must sadly confess that I still can
see but little merit in the bill.
:. Incidentally, it' is remarkable that
so many brilliant critical personages
as the imposing array of initials , in-
dicated, should agree so completely
on things clearly opinionative. . '
If “House Peters’ acting was su-
perb” then the'dummy in Max Ad-
ler’s -window during Homecoming
looked like a football player.. It is
convenient—in fact, economical—
for the manager of the Palace that
a certain group of upper-classmen
at Notre Dame arid, .some towns-
people are so wonderfully pleased

with, delight the rolling of actor’s

Permit me a few words on the

in let me mention again Billy House

nothing more than a “burlesque”
display of lingerie, “vulgarly pre-
sented, though laughable at times”
(quoted from my review). Just be-
cause it had , several • innocently
amusing mopients would not serve
as sufficient reason to endorse it as
highly entertaining in the NOTRE

olic institution. For reasons such
as these the Palace bill was not
lauded. ’ But—was- my- criticism
“unfair’’?	।
And,, if the reviewer is to write ;
anything else than his candid opin- '
ion of the show, tell the Editor-in-

manager of the theatre turn in the
write-ups? . .
Seemingly your disapproval of the
review was purely personal. Why
not hash up something really clever
the next time and run it in “By-

cuse for translating J. F. S,?

“Six Days” is a most conspicuous
- example of .what a good cast can do
for a play. Elinor Glyn has writ-
ten an extremely medium-grade yo-
mance with the exception of a. few
- scenes. True, it contains nothing
that is bad; but that is almost ex-1
, cessive praise of it. The director
had, however, the acumen to pro-
cure Corinne Griffith and Frank
Mayo, to provide them with good
support, and get them to hoist the
thing on their shoulders and put it
over. •
In spite of the work of the cast
the. affair starts off with a couple of
snoozes, and something suspiciously
like a snore'; then, breaking into a
whirlwind of dramatic action, it
suddenly lies down and dies. Few
movies today can produce a. finer
bit of dramatic tension-than that
which rivets the attention of the
and a couple of heart-aches. :The
thrills might have gained the yokels’
applause in the days When the men-
about-town waited for the heroine
1 at the stage door.
As might be inferred from the
title, the play deals with the advent
of an innocent country-bred maiden
into the wicked city of New York,
where the chorus girls whistle
naughty songs and the men make
faces in the “L” mirrors. '
“Propaganda in favor of min-
isters was the purpose of the pic-
ture,” was one of jhe comments we
overheard. This .may be true, as
the general run of clergymen’s sons
are not heroes of the resigned type,
with injurecf air and sad eyes.
Nothing is more certain than the
fact that a hero will be rescued
from certain death despite all ob-
stacles. If no one else, is handy he
will extricate himself by his own
powers. Nevertheless we keep go-
ing to thrillers in the hope that
some day the fair heroine will , stop
1 to powder her nose or pick up a
four-leaf clover and pause long
enough to let the villain send the
brave youth to his death.

What Others Say
ROCKNE SAYS:
Editor’ of the Daily Nebraskan.
! Dear Sir:
’ I have been away for several
weeks on some games and some
very important business, hence I
have not had time to write you on
a matter which I consider very im-
portant.
One of our local boys on our
DAILY took it upon himself to
write an editorial in the NOTRE
DAME DAILY here from which it
might be inferred that the Univer-
sity of Nebraska student body .did
not act the part of the perfect host.
I am very sorry that this fellow
took it upon himself to put. forth
his personal opinion as an expres-
sion of anyone here officially at
Notre Dame University. The mem-
bers of our team and myself feel
very much hurt about this article
in our paper and in behalf of them
and myself I wish to assure you
that we have nothing but the
kindliest feelings towards the Uni-
versity of Nebraska. We have al-
'ways been treated very fairly and
courteously. I cannot see where
university undergraduates with a
few exceptions observe the rules of
clean speech and that cursing in the
grandstands reported after a num-
ber of football games in other cities
must have been done by outside
spectators without any connection
with or responsibility to the com-
peting colleges.
audience. -throughout : the third,
■ fourth, and part of the fifth reels.
In this respect the scenes in the
dug-out are masterful.
' . The story lacks the spiciness
which is usually associated with
Elinor Glyn’s romances. No . doubt
the worthy lady after reading some
of her contemporaries either ad-
mitted defeat-or decided to be or-
iginal. Those who. go to see the
. picture- because they have read
Elinor Glyn’s other novels, or have
seen them filmed, will be disap-
pointed; but those, who go to see a
well-acted melodrama will not have
spent an afternoon or evening ;in
' vain.'
•The moral, as we interpret it, is
—don’t' go into a dug-out with a
girl unless she has her hands
tied,
and even then keep, near the exit.
. Dish Washer Installed
; In Brownson Refectory
Rejoice, men of Notre Dame!
No longer will you be compelled,
obliged, or even privileged to cut
your tender lips upon cracked cups
or clean your mouths with an un-
desirable quantity of Feis Naptha,
for in the Brownson refectory
there has been installed a new Vic-
tor dish washer. It’s automatic,
electric, help-saving, and is pos-
sessed of’ qualities “too many to
mention.” ' ' .
. A - little electricity, some hot
soapy water, some air to dry the
china, one man (or woman), and a
tray, is all that is needed.
. It will cut down the expense. of
the students, because there will not
be so many waiters to tip. There-
fore this addition to the University ।
equipment should meet with the ap- I
proval of all.	I
anyone at the University can be
held accountable for whatever re-
marks and actions might be made
by outside hoodlums and small
town sports who happened' to at-
tend the game.
There is always a tendency on
the part of poor sports to be look-
ing for alibis when they are beaten
but I just wish to tell you that our
team and myself and our student
body realize that on'Saturday, No-
vember 10, the University of Ne-
xbraska was a great team, played
wonderful football,, and deserved to
win.
Two things are deducible from
this. The first is that the student
feels enough loyalty to his school
and his fellows to express himself
when he feels expression is needed.;
The second is that a representative
student places himself on the side
of clean speech and implies that
among undergraduates there is a
clean speech sentiment.
Aside from the training and lead-
ership in the academic halls the
great influence for good or evil in
the lives of the young men is the
body known , as the alumni. Re-
cently from various colleges have
come official complaints that the
alumni, returning for festivals, have
encouraged drinking among under-
graduates. In every branch of per-
sonal conduct the successful, pros-
perous man of business or profes-
sion, a few years out of college, is a
tremendous influence over the boys
not yet graduated. Therefore, if
clean speech is to be made a fact
the business and professional men ■
who influence the boys must adopt
it. They must make it a standard
of conduct.
.	3
not express himself in the language
successfully is usually the one who
resorts to oaths to give his utter-
ances strength. Command of the
power of invective is a literary and
rhetorical gift which is not to be
undervalued, but invective that is
powerful is never profane or ir-
reverent.—South Bend Tribune.
PROM TICKETS
Students who bewail the three
dollar tax for the Military ball
should go to Notre Dame. The reg-
ular price at the South Bend insti-
tution for Prom tickets is ten

Notre Dame Men
Attend Poultry Show -
Several members of the Notre
Dame:Poultry club, accompanied by .
Professor Hawyard of the Poultry
I Department, and Mr. Phelps, mana-
1 ger of the Healthwin Poultry farm,
attended the nineteenth annual
poultry show of The Midwest Poul-

Chicago. The show was held in the

There is a great deal of wholly
superfluous rough and uncouth talk
today which, if not profane, is re-
moved from it only by a degree. It is
thought to be^strong language, but
is really the reverse. The person

John Levi, full back of the Has-

for All-Western, passed consistent-
ly all season for 40, 50 and 55 yds.
The skill of the Indian’s passing
was exhibited on Cartier field in
1921, when Notre Dame met Has-
kell. The clever Indian back could
take the pass from center, run back
toward his own goal five or eight
yards, and then pass 40 or 50
yards to the receiver on an angle
across the field.	.
