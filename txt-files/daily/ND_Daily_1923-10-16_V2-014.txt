, The snake dance 'of Saturday
night, however, did yield a bit of
material for comment when John
Bianchi^ who is spending his first
year. out here on the plain plains
of Indiana, away from his little
home in New Joisy, when John; we
want to. say, who was in the snake
dance', snake danced onto his broad
back. John moves with difficulty
and as a. result may not?be able to
attend the delightful Harvest party
at the Tribune this evening. ■ < -

bridge, he said, is composed of 18
colleges, each of which is repre-
sented by; its fellows in the general
governing body of the university.
. The name Cambridge, he stated,
is taken from the situation of the
university on the banks of the Cam
near the'famed bridge of that river.
It claims to be founded by King
Arthur,' he said, in opposition to the
claim made by Oxford that it was
founded: by King Alfred. - . •

’ Holy Communion records duriiig
the Mission just finished' Saturday
were better than in any previous
year, according to figures supplied
by Rev. John F. O’Hara, head of
the Department of Religion.
The figures are as follows:

year is in its regular order.
‘ One hundred campus men, Father
O’Hara said, who are regular Com-
municants, did not receive daily
Holy Communion every day during
the 1923-Mission. :
" Father O’Hara was much pleased
with the success of the off-campus
Mission, held for the first time this
year. Its success made up for the
laxity of some, on the campus, he
said.

CHEERS GREET
FIGHTINGTEAM
Thousands at Train; March to Elks
Club and Cheer Individual Mem-' -
bers; Rockne Escapes.
South Bend and Notre Dame
vociferously welcomed the : victor-?
ious Fighting Irish when: they; re-
turned from the Army-NotreDame
battlefield, Ebbetts field, Sunday,
evening.	.	.
Five thousand persons jammed .
themselves in the vicinity- of the
New York Central station when the .
train drew, in at 5:25. Led by ‘
Cheer-leader Eddie Luther, the
Notre Dame bband, playing “The
Victory Song,” the students and
many South Bend people then fell
into line and escorted the team—or
as many of the team as could be
found—to the Elks club, where a
further demonstration was held.
. Coach Knute K-. Rockne escaped
the. delegation by leaving the train, .
it is said, before it reached South
Bend. .
The crowd cheered long and loud ’
at the station and continued their
cheers as' the line marched through
the city, the way lit by red torches *
and marked out by a decorated car
driven by William Conmrs, of
South Bend, a former Notre Dame
student. On the. car was Eddie
Luther, cheer leader, .who directed
the . cheering. Somewhere in the
linefof march was the Army Mule
with a sign indicating the score on
its side. '	.'’••/
When the crowd reached the Elks
Club building' more .joined ..the en- . ,
thusiastic aggfegatfon? and alb space *
near the building was‘filled. The /
“UI N. DJ,” the serin and other yells
followed each other until Luther
announced from the balcony of the
building, that the team would ap-
pear beside him soon. /The few
moments of silence ‘were ‘ followed
by renewed cheers when the faces
of. Captain Harvey Brown, Don
Miller and Elmer Layden appeared.
Each man who played was given a
lengthy ovation, Adam Walsh, be-
ing perhaps, cheered longest. ,. .
Speeches were demanded, but ?
Coach Rockne, it seems, had given ,
orders that no man would talk, and -
no man did talk. . .	.	.	■
Cries for. the defeat of Princeton
next Saturday, and for Notre Dame
as national champion this year, fol-
lowed. .	. ; '	‘7 ’ -	?	.
. Hoarse and smiling, still enthus-	"
iastic and proud,, the crowd, Notre
Dame men and South Bend people,
then broke up, chattering as they
left of the “wonderful game won
by Rockne’s Fighting Team?’

COMPLETING THE VICTORY
Notre Dame/.defeated the ;powerful cadets Saturday afternoon,
and by so doing, won one of'the greatest football classics of the 1923
season. But’ that victory, was not made complete until, at. least; as; far
as traditiori is concerned^ the team was welcomed home by . their Fight-
ing Irish” student-body supporters. y ”
When Notre Dame’s teams leave the campus to defend their repu-
;tatiori’ori foreign fields/they go perfectly tutored by . the Wonder
Coach Rockne, and filled’ with the. confidence. of every man at the
University. ’ And win or lose, when the gridders return, the students,
iri keeping with'the-traditional pledge of loyalty to their teammates, are
at the depot to welcome: them back amid voluminous cheers and yells
that' rend the atmosphere with their piercing echoes.	• z
•	. It is unquestionable, that Rockne’s science is the biggest factor in
the ‘Notre Dame victories; his football technique and strategy instilled
into /our. teams has earned for them the most enviable-reputations as
tlie’greatest in;the/country. But even Rockne asserts that were it mot
for ,the “spirit” of the men behind each individual player, he. never
could.have: produced: the extraordinarily wonderful teams that he has"
And -so,, when the victors return Notre Dame men must prove by.
th^ir welcome that they are part'of the team—the. team that may.be
the couritry’s best?'this year. ■ '•	/ •.:; . ;	.	. • >,

CLASS CUTS
The new regulations for/class‘absences are a great improvement.
■ -Previous;rules for- class; absences . were grossly inadequate.. The
fellow*, without jconsciencej or with muchr “pull.” did not, need . to -fear
the possibility of dismissal under the old regulations/ A doctor’s cer-
tificate ,was easy to secure, a landlady might be persuaded, to -sign
excusesT-Lif it seemed she might lose, a boarder; or, if she were a gen-
erous'soul,'if it seemed the poor chap might be dismissed from school
—and; even now arid .then, a chap, with a tearful story might even soften
the heart of aUniversity executive..	,	.
. .But . all. .that is; past.., Students who-are absent now, are absent.
That is all there is-to it. /Under, the new regulations—the'Colgate sys-
tem—allowance is-made for.; the. number of times a man may reasonably
miss a class-in’ a semester, and he;is not “cut” if ; he is absent those few
times. -But; if he '.misses :oftener';than the’-number of, times, the average
■ man' misses,’ his 'marks for ' the-period gradually fall. The system also
calculates/that a rriari' should ' not pass /the; class if he is absent-a : set
i number {.of‘‘times; ten times’ in a tlnjeeJiour ’ class. The belief .is that; a
man whb/is riot there at least a .certain period of times has missed so
much that’he is hot .'entitled to pass. He has missed too many lectures,
. it is; believed, to be able tograsp, the;.siibject-as well as the'man: who
attends regularly, ;and any amount'.of makeup work he might do. can-
not.,make, up; for.,what; lie has. missed. ;	• J
.	The new.system is not only»significant.as a morerefficient mariner,
of handling'class absences, a. good in itself, but it is .important , as one
•more step toward the better' and greater . Notre . Dame. ■	.

The producers of . “Merry

year in making it, and after seeing
it you will be of the opinion that
the time'was xvell spent. It is a
'lavish affair, well directed, admir-
ably' set, and equally admirably
acted by a cast which is headed by
Norman Kerry and Mary Philbin.
Prominent among. the players is
George Hackathorne whose wistful
interpretation of a huch-backed side
show barker is the best thing that
he has done- since he appeared in
“The> Little Minister.” .	•
■ The story abounds in what is
called by the hackneyed term “hu-
man .interest.” What else could
you expect of a picture in which/an
Austrian, count falls in love with a
girl who plays a grind organ at a
Viennese Coney Island? The count,
for reasons of state, is obliged to
marry a member of the aristocracy,
despite his love for' Agnes, the
daughter of . a clown, ' and there’s
your story. -	’	..-
It is a plot which could easily
have become a. flat failure, but be-,
cause; of the careful workmanship
which has gone, in it, it is one of
the best pictures of the year.

What They Say

h By WALTER ECKERSALL '
NEW YORK, Oct. 13.—[Special]
—-A slashirig attack, combinirig for-
mations of the close and operi vari-
ety, gave Notre Dame a victory oyer
West Point today at Ebbets’- field,
-4 iLto-0,Tin^.one: of ^the .hardest jmd,'
at- the . same . time,. most cleanly
played games ,in the ten years of
football relations between the two
institutions. - -	.'.	■
.. /The result, although partially ex-
pected by. loyal supporters of the
middle west eleven, xvas .a severe
shock to followers of the game in
this section. The Army had been
rated , one of the best in the east,
but the crafty, ■ nimble and alert
Notre Dame players took advantage
of > everything. They, followed the
ball in catlike fashion, while, their
tackling ‘and blocking - xvas about
. the fiercest one can imagine. . v
^Despite the known strength of
t^e Army line, the Hoosier backs
tore through on delayed bucks, slid
off the tackles, and, xvhen 'the sec-
ondary defenses caine up; to 'help
the forward wall, forward passes
xvere called into commission. The
heady work of Harry Stuhldreher,
Notre Dame quarterback, had much
. to,;,do with the' foxy, attack, which
was launched . behind - unbalanced
lines and from a ^backfield . shift. ,
through the Notre Dame forward
wall for 40 yards but made only
nine around the ends. The punt-
ing was about even, as each booter
averaged clo^e to 45 yards. ,
[New York Times]....
One of the most’admirably drill-
ed teams that Notre Dame has ever
turned out made the pilgrimage
from South Bend, Ind., and yes-
terday doled out another defeat to
the Army. The Hoosiers, schooled
by the master football tactician,
Knute Rockne, turned loose a baf-
fling assortment of plays that pro-
duced two touchdoxyns. * * *
The victory was’ the . Hoosiers’
seventh out of the series; of ten
games that the two intersectional
rivals have played, the Army com-
ing off the field . victorious only
twice, and-one game, last year’s,
resulting in a tie. The defeat ad-
ministered \ to the West Pointers,
yesterday f afternoon, however, xvas'
one of the bitterest blows of all,
for this year’s eleven, under the
coaching of Captain John McEwan
and with the playing of Tiny Hew-
itt; former Panther star, jn'the
backfield, the West Pointers came
off the plains looking forward to
getting ample revenge for'past hu-
miliations.	'
Their defeat, however, was no
disgrace, for the South Bend team,
composed for the most part of nexv
men and outxveighed to a marked
degree by the cadets, proved itself
to be one of the greatest offensive
aggregations ever at the South
Bend institution, which - has been
represented by many notable elev-
ens. It is not casting any asper-
sion on. the Army team, to say that
it was completely outclassed by this
exceptional team from the middle
west....'' ■ ■ /■ • •	'
Proof of this is seen in the statist
tics of the! game. .
The outstanding star of the game
was Layden, Notre Dame’s full-
back, . xvho did all of the punting,
most of the ground gaining, xvas
passer and‘ /receiver, and in .addi-
tion played a xvonderful defensive
game..	.	.

NEW YORK, Oct. 14.—[Special]
—-Notre Dame’s decisive victory
oyer the Army, 13 to 'O/Jin, one of
the most important intersectional
juggles of the year (was “one. of
the) salient features of Saturday’s
football games. • .;	:	;	.
’ ■ Winning over the Army at Brook-:
tyn,. Notre Dame gave a xvonderful
? exhibition of offensive and defen-
siye football.;■■ Victory... of ' Coach
. Rockne’s team was clean cut and
decisive. 'Neither score xvas the di-
rect result of a fluke, but each, xvas
earned * by the launching of unex-
Pec,ted plays at opportune moments.
This bewildering .attack combined
with.-a stubborn defense, made No-
tre.Dame a great team, one;which is
ftoxv figured ,to beat Princeton in
^rigletoxvn next Saturday. • . -'
; ;An idea of Notre Dame, decisive
victory; may. be gained . from the
fact that. Rockne’s team made 13
first downs to two for the'Army.
Notre Dame completed four out of
S1*: forxvard passes, one of which
resulted in a touchdown. The
Army attempted eleven - forward
Passes, none of xvhich xvas complet-
ed*’ Notre Dame made 105 yards
through the Army line and 60
around ends. West Point drove'
of Notre Dame, halfbacks whose
seemly hunch, was forward.
‘Knute K. Rockne’s great .aggre-
gation from the Indiana reserva-
tion, with sudden thrusts through
the air, and slashing drives along
the turf, beat the big Army team
13 to 0 while a capacity crowd at
Ebbets’ field, with thousands turn-
ed away, sat by and marvelled.
In vain the gray garbed, cadet
corps from up the Hudson called to
the Army—“Fight-—Fight—Fight.”
In vain they, sang their inspira-
tional melodies of battle.. Through-
out the tumult and the shouting
the slim fleet blue jerseyed backs
from the middle west found the
path , twice that leads across to the
goal into victory over one of. the
best of the,'.Army teams.
The Army fought to the .finish,
but: the Army with all its power,
had nothing to match that spirally
array of backfield talent made up
of Crowley, Layden, Miller and
Stuhldreher, all sweeping' forward
back of a fast aggressive line that
continually got the charge.
5 For one . quarter, fighting out
man to . man along the turf, the
Army held its own. But the tide
turned when Notre Dame suddenly
went into-the air, abandoning’the
bayonet for the aeroplane, and from
that moment the cadets. were over-
whelmed.	•

FIGURES SHOW
RAPID GROWTH
Every College Has Increased Enroll-
ment since 1916; Freshman
Class Big as 1916 University.
Detailed ' figures on enrollment,
announced yesterday, shoxved that
Notre Dame is rapidly groxvirig,
and again indicated the immediate
need for the success of the/endow-
ment drive now being conducted.
The number of students accord-
ing .to colleges xvas 1,855 on Sep-
tember 20, it was stated. The Col-
lege of Arts and Letters has 376
students enrolled, compared with
210 in 1916, which, at that time in-,
eluded the members of the ;preserit
College of Commerce; the College
of Engineering totals 397; as com-
pared with 191 in 1916; the enroll-
ment in the College of Science in
1916 was 60, and noxv is 169;"the
College of. Law numbers 373 and
had, 202 in 1916;, the College, of
Commerce has the largest enroll-
ment in the .University, totaling
536, a remarkable growth during
recent years.	;	:
The Freshman emollment of this
year, is 713, or as many as in the
entire University in 1916.
Less than “one-fourth of the stu-
dent body are from Indiana, it, xvas
said, although Notre Dame is in
Indiana. The University draws its
men from almost every state in the
Union and from 14 foreign coun-
tries. Notre Dame is not a local, or
sectional, but a national institu-
tion.	.	/

All indications, both from the

from • the - East a “practice tilt,”

Rockne put the second and third
strings through a scrimmage prac-

. Connel and Hauser, toting the ball
foi* the varsity, went through the
frosh, with terrific line plunges-and
made brilliant end runs.. Early, in

The raw.recruits of Carroll hall

.Sunday afternoon when they played

opposition from their inexperienced
rivals, but were forced-to' go the
limit to hold down the scoring.
. Brownson scored first when she
'tallied with a touchdown from a

line, but from then on was fully
'occupied in holding down the: per-

in the third quarter when Captain

thoritative articles on Catholic sub-
jects; . numerous . essays, short
