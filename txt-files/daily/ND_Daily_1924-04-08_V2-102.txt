. Frank Patrick Walsh, of Brown-

Commerce, died Sunday night at
10:35 o’clock, after a valiant fight
for life. His .death was: peaceful
and happy, after receiving the sac-
rements.	’	J
Just before benediction Sunday-
night, Father O?Hara announced
that, there was no hope for his re-
covery,. and all students* partici-
pated in the' saying of the rosary for
him. His ’ father was at his bed-
side, and accompanied the body
back to Cleveland, where he will be
buried, yesterday morning'. This
morning at 6:30 .o’clock a solemn
high mass of requiem was to be said
for the repose of his soul.
Frank Walsh was a daily comuni-
cant, and a fine fellow-—his per- j
sonality was especially pleasing to
those who knew him. , Two weeks
ago, he answered the call for spring
football, and was trying for the
quarter-back berth. He was hap-
py, interesting and jovial. The
school mourns his death.'

RAZZES AND NEWS
The Notre Dame “razz” is a valuable element in Notre Dame
life; it helps to make Notre Dame men..
But sometimes it is not valuable, .	.
The DAILY has a staff of reporters, almost all freshmen. The
DAILY and Notre Dame are dependent on these men for news, of the
university. They are energetic, earnest; conscientious men, but they are
new to Notre Dame. To get news they must interview older Notre
Dame men, and, oftentimes, instead of being given the news they are
given “bum steers,” and are subjected to general razzings.
Sometimes their story is published—wrong.
Sometimes it is. not published—and next day indignant razzers call
. up the DAILY to learn why it did not appear.
The reporter has been unable to get a story, and he has also,se-
cured an incorrect opinion of Notre Dame life—because of ill-directed
^razzing. It will be better for all if the practice is discontinued.
■ KEEP OFF THE GRASS
. . . :The Notre Dame man is on his honor, not to mar the beauty of
the campus by cutting corners and leaving his footprints on the lawn
jof-the quadrangle between the cinder paths that are laid out for his
4ise and convenience.
,• The “Please” signs have been placed at points about the campus
as in former years. In the past the signs have been of little value,
the average student paying no attention to them. In’ fact, some men
seemed to take them as a sort of dare, which they could not afford to
overlook. Then again some of the more athletically inclined among
us discovered that the signs made, admirable hurdles and acted ac-
cordingly. . . •	■
Our campus is beautiful when it is in good'condition. The univer-
sity authorities try to keep it looking nice, and the least the student
can do ,is .to co-operate to the extent of refraining from undoing what
the school'is trying to achieve.'	i

-ground is soft and the grass young and tender can leave in his wake

NOWHERE ELSE IN THE
WORLD, by Jay William Hudson,
D. Appleton and Co., New York,
$2.00.
For some reason the college man
has become a favorite subject for
anaylsis. He is being carefully ex-
amined, dissected, rolled over,
[jabbed by needles, arid pinched by
tweezers (sometimes painfully)
and then-stuffed is exhibited in the
glass cages built by novelists. For
the most part, this exhibited mum-
my is no more than a mummy—it
is not real.
We have looked at the amusing,
when not revolting, mummies ex-
hibited by Fitzgerald and others.
Among the many was that of
Stephen Vincent Benet, “The Be-
ginning of Wisdom,” one of the
truest of the pictures, prettily po- ]
etic, but not without its revolting!
parts. None • of them seemed as
convincing, and worthwhile as “The
Sinister Street” of Compton Mac-
•Kenzie, or, to go back many years,
the “Pendirinis,” of Thackery, an
artist’s picture', yind ’.therefore a
true picture for any age.
; Now we have Mr. Hudson’s ex-
hibition. The college incidents in
“Nowhere Else in the World” are
only a part .of this story, which is
primarily about Chicago, but as a
part of the story which philosophi-
cally narrates the experience of a
man with European idealism in
American, materialism, it . must
treat of-college. The hero, Stephen
Kent, has his college experience
when he teaches at Athens, a state
’’ollege with an enrollment of some
'hree thousand, where he becoriies
heartily disillusioned about the pos-
’ibility of the practical application
his theories for educational per-
fection. He learns to compromise
with , the American spirit, an. active
iTge' ior the perpetuation , of huge-
ness and the grasping for wealth.
As another viewpoint on American
college life, it is worthwhile, and
unqualifiedly more moral than the
most of the books that remark on
L>e same subject—-the books that
look at gutters, garbage cans, and
nther~muck, andare ‘ so' fascinated
•■hat then can lopk up but occassion-
ally. ‘	: -
But for all that,' the book,' though
perfect in its working out (one can
sense :the professional minuteness
■with which the Missouri pedagogue
weighed his every' detail) lacks the
living spirit that gives a book pow-
er, and makes it-; art. It is riot as
good as the author’s other book,
“Abbe Pierre,”- but it is a good
book.	/
High School Sportsmanship
At the conclusion of the regular
period of the El Reno-Detroit
Northeastern contest there appeared
one of the most unusual exhibitions
of sportsmanship that has been ob-
served thus far the entire season.
As is related elsewhere on this page,
El Reno was one point behind the
Detroit men when the gun went off
immediately following a foul against
Glass, Oklahoma forward, leaving
[the issue of a tie or loss directly in
his hands.
. At this moment Molenda, Detroit
forward, stepped up and wished
him success in the try. The act
was an open manifestation of the
undercurrent of good sportsman-

insuperable Hamilton. -	,
< His acceptance of the office was one of the finest achievements of
the Harding administration. It showed beyond question that capable
men of large affairs could be induced to accept high public trust and
protect a great nation at a great crisis from the blunderings of small
men.	'
The attack on him seems to be from partisan reasons, and, if this
is so, its. result may be closing the minds of the able, to government
office. Such a consequence will probably result in harm far greater
and more, fundamental; than any good that can come from the attacks.,

preciation for their work in the interest of the university during the
. course of the year. The members of this organization are most assur-
fedly deserving of reward for their numerous activities such as staging
the Homecoming celebration. -The small charms they receive should
serve not only-as identification as a booster , for Notre Dame, but also
‘as encouragement for other men on the campus to devote their' efforts
along kindred lines. It will be a good thing when all campus activities
. are recognized by some such distinctive mark', for then competition will
be greater and the activities improved.

G? ------ -
An avalanche of joyful predic-
tions was the greeting extended to
the Notre Dame baseball team by
the dopesters who watched the Irish
nine defeat the Mishawaka Inde-
structos 13-3 yesterday afternoon.
The practice tilt was the first regu-
lar nine inning session of the year,
and although the score was of minor
importance, the game served as an
excellent conditioner before the
start of . the. spring jaunt.
The line-up that trampled on the
Indestructos gave the local fans an
opportunity to get a glimpse of the
men who* may fill regular berths on
the Irish nine this season. Magev-
ney and Silver, who composed the
battery for the first five innings,
were supplanted by Dywer and Cer-
ney. Nolan at first, Ash at second,
Captain Sheehan in the short field,
and Prendergast at third, made up
the infield, while Dunne, Bergman,
and Reese played the outfield.
Although the encounter was pri-
marily a practice game and lacked
the heat of rivalry since the visitors
were also in the seasoning stage,
the varsity gave a nice exhibition of
ball playing, and the prospects of
an aggressive club became more
promising as the game progressed.
The several new men who were in
the line-up yesterday gave a very
creditable account of themselves
and if the calibre of the squad im-
proves on the southern trip with
the same consistency that it has
since the outdoor work began, Coach
Keogan will be able to present as
formidable a ball club this spring
as ever represented the school.
Magevney, starting on the mound
• yesterday, । displayed the same ef-
fective poise and slab form that
characterized his work- last-.-year.
Dwyer, who followed Mageveny,
gave a creditable performance for
four innings and showed possibili-
ties of being a hitting pitcher.
Prenderbrast, a recruit on the third
’ sack, handled himself well on the
field and on. several occasions gave
an exhibition of clean .fielding. He
has improved his batting form and
a few trials under fire should make
him into a dependable hitter.
Nolan and Ash have been tailor
made for the initial and keystone
sacks, and both men are aggressive
batters. Sheehan, in.the short field,
was not quite up to his regular
form, but proved that he is still a
dependable batter. Dunne, in the
center field, handled two long high
drives from Paul Castner’s bat in
elegant fashion, which proves that

“THE HILL BILLY”
O’Hare Wins Half
Mile at DePauw
After winning the first track
meet of the outdoor season with the
DePauw Tigers in easy fashion, the
Notre Dame trackmen have begun
preparations for the Cleveland, and
Drake meets, the next two assign-
ments on the Irish card. A mile
team and a two-mile team will be
sent to the Cleveland Interscholas-
tic next Saturday. Wayne Cox is
also scheduled for a match race in
ton. Besides the relay teams sev-
the half mile with Conger of Prince-
eral individual entries will be sent
to Drake for the western classic,
April 25 and 26.
Russell O’Hare, veteran distance
runner on the Blue and Gold track
team raced home a winner in the
half-mile run at DePauw Saturday.
The reports received over the wire
announced the name of Cox.
O’Hare completes his course this
year and has performed with credit
on Notre Dame’s track and cross-
country teams for three years.
he can play the outfield as well
as first base. Bergman had an
idle afternoon in the garden, but
showed some nice head work at
bat. Cerney and Silver, behind the
plate, have fortified the backstop
position with some high class work.
Both men handled themselves well
and watched the. base runners with
particular care. .
. The Mishawaka team was made
up of several former Notre Dame
baseball stars, including Paul Cast-
ner, who took a turn on the mound
for three innings and held his for-
mer team-mates in check after the
Irish had started a slugging fast
on “Swede” Edgren. The visitors
scored their initial run when Cast-
ner garnered the first hit off Ma-
gevney. Notre Dame evened the
count in the second frame and
piled up four runs in the third inn-
ing.	,
___The^..next.. three innings .went
scoreless with' Castner in the box.
The semi-pros , sent in two more
twirlers in the last three innings
and the Irish bombarded them for
eight runs.	,

Victories by Carroll, Walsh,
Freshman and Badin featured the
opening, of the Interhall. baseball
season Sunday. Brownson, sched-
uled to play the Day Dodgers, had
an idle day as the . off-campus men
were unable to get a team on the
field.
. 7 The opening game of the cam:
pus season indicated, that the league
will include some exceptionally fast
ball clubs, and of j the eight teams
that got into action Sunday, there
were several members of each team
who showed more than ordinary
ability. Hard hitting featured the
games, but due to the earliness of
the season, much of the fielding
work was slow and ragged and only
occassionally did there appear a
flash of real form.	'■
Carroll, 14.
Sorin, 9.
Carroll defeated Sorin in a
morning game, 14-9, and displayed
some remarkable hitting power.
De Gurse in the box for Sorin was
pounded for at least one run in all
but the first and third innings.
Besten and Ronay of Carroll kept
the dorm nine on top of the pile
most of the game and were not hit
to any great extent during the
game with the exception of the fifth

Forty Huskers Out
for Spring Football
Spring football training at Ne-
braska was given impetus - today
when outdoor work was introduced
for the first time during the ses-
sion and forty aspiring gridders re-
ported for practice. The squad was
directed by assistant coaches-on the
Husker staff, and several veterans
from last year were also out to
handle the group work.
Prospects for a whirlwind ma-
chine in 1924 cannot attract vefy
much comment yet, as much de-
pends upon the result of the spring
training. The wonder backfield of
last fall will be graduated in June,
and new material will have to. be
found to take the • place of Noble,

The University of Princeton’s
prize rowing shell was wrecked in a
practice spin on Lake Carnegie Sat-
urday afternoon, when the craft
struck a snag and the crew was
plunged into the icy waters. No
injuries resulted. The shell was
highly prized in Tiger traditions
because it had carried the Prince-
ton crew to victory over Yale, Har-
vard and the Navy in 1921.
