BY-PATHS
Wait around the corner for me
■with outstretched arms, empty if
you like this column; with a club
in them if you don’t like it.
Being anonymous, I can say such
things with-safety.
You may call me Mr. Grundy.
Perhaps one of the best ■ known
men on the campus is Harry Mc-
.. Guire, president- of almost as many
* clubs as the renowned Slaggert. It
is appropriate, therefore, that this
; column’s first remarks be about
Harry. He'was the representative
of . more clubs-than anybody else at
the'S. A. C. meeting of club presi-
' dents the other day. It was nat-
ural, therefore, for the-fellow who
came in-THE DAILY office the
other day to hunt for Harry, who
writes editorials . for this sheet,
poems signed “H. A. M.” for The
'Scholastic, makes comic sketches
for. The Juggler, hunts Indian suits
for pageants, runs the Scribblers,
the Rocky Mountain club, and a
few -more, and is an officer of the
Caseys; it was natural, I say, for
this fellow to seek Harry when he
wanted to put an ad in the paper.
'John Dore, noted explorer of the
Far East, is next in line for com-
ment. John'startled the campus
Sunday when he appeared with his
riewTaby-blue cap. Perhaps John’s
girl likes that color, or maybe, it’s
the latest- from deah Lunnun.
■ - The Campus Forders will ’organ-
"ize~Sodu,'iffMark^Nohui will' permit*
it. -'/ Al Heebe is the unanimous
choice for Henry, or president. His
two-seater is equalled in noise by
Dore’s baby-blue cap only. Among
the/other candidates for Henry are
John Weibel, Tom Barber and Bob
I./Worth. -“The club,” says Bob,
shiek of Indianapolis, smiling as he
cracked his little joke, “won’t turn
out to be a flivver.” .
■Which reminds us of canes—-ap-
purtenances worn by senior lawyers
to indicate their distinction;, and
about which other, seniors are now
arguing, / Canes, we understand,
are things with which to slap class-
mates on the patches, things with
\yhich to trip old men, or, occa-
sionally, things to wear for dress.
Bob Cooney, Brownson’s star
quarter, went like a miniature
- Crowley Sunday and scored - the
touchdown that beat Walsh. In-
spiration, ,in the.person of one of
■ the only women he ever loved, was
- present on the sidelines. Father
Haggerty may. suggest that such
incentives be^ prohibited at interhall
. squabbles. • .	-
And Sorin and Corby, for not
appearing at all, -may consider
themselves officially bawled out.
The interhall spirit, - we are in-
formed, is the basis of the varsity
spirit, and— /■	•	.

“Columbus,” the first of a series
°f motion pictures depicting the
history of the world, was shown

.for the members of the University

Clubs’ Existence to be
Decided by Activity
Mark Nolan, of the S. A. C., in-
formed the presidents of clubs as-
sembled in the Library yesterday,
that all the clubs on the campus
would be put on probation and a
careful check would be kept of all
club activities.
Of the many suggestions offered,
one concerned itself with the filing
of written reports with the S. A. C.,
of current activities of clubs. The
advisability of delegating a repre^
sentative of the S. A. C. to attend,
meetings of clubs was discussed.
NEW BUM
FOR ST. MARY'S
Notre Dame Graduate Is Architect;
Building to Be Best on Campus,
It Is Said; Work Begins Soon.
Work upon .a new building for
St. Mary’s College will begin soon.
Maurice Carroll, who graduated
from the University’s Department
of Architecture in 1919, is the
architect and will be in charge of
the 'construction of the buildjng,
which will be more pretentious than
any other building ati the college.
The new structure will include
dormitories, private rooms, class
rooms, reception and recreation
rooms. In all probability it will be-
come the ■ administration building,
it is said.	' .
The increased enrollment at the
college has necessitated the addi-
tional building. At present every
available space, is being utilized to
prevent, an y. o ver er o wdi n g/- B y,h ext

constructed a magnificent Catholic
church in Kansas City.

agreed to donate the deficit if the
drive is not altogether successful.

ENDS MISSION
Father Donahue Speaks of Sanctity
. of Mass; Students to Pray for
Team at New York.
The campus mission will end this
morning With a high "mass, and
Papal benediction given by Rev.
James W. Donahue, who is con-
ducting the mission. ' Rev. Matthew
J. Walsh, president of the‘Univer-
sity, will sing- the mass.
/The mission has been the most
successful ever given the students.
It was attended by more students
than ever before, and new Holy
Communion records were estab-
lished.
On Thursday evening ■ Father
Donahue. delivered, a. sermon on
“The Dark Beyond.” He .spoke, of
the priesthood and brotherhood and
urged the men to consider vocations
to the religious life. Father' Dona-
huealso dwelt upon the religious
life Friday morning, and pointed
out the blessings that come to those
who lead such a life.-
. Last evening Father Donahue
spoke on “God Is Love.” “Create
a feeling for the mass and never
lose it,” he said. He also' spoke of
the reverence the Notre Dame man
has for the Eucharist.
All communions received at the,
off-campus , mission this morning
will be . for the success of Notre
Dame’s football team today. -
“That team is worth your -pray-
ers,” the Rev. George Finnegan
said last night. “I am not going to
ask-that you pray for a. victory, al-
though that would be a most desir-
able thing,” he continued, “but that
you pray for the men, that they do
not get hurt and that they play like
Notre' Dame men,” said Father
Finnegan^
The sermon delivered by Father
Finnegan dealt with the passions.
He compared , the sins of humanity
with the action of Judas, when he
betrayed • Christ.
Hell, its > existence and its rela-
tion to God and the Catholic
Church was discussed by Father
Finnegan, Thursday night. ‘
“Hell is a means of punishment,”
he told those present. “Law is
necessary for any institution. Hell
is the punishment of those who do
not obey her laws.”

NEW .YORK, N. Y., Oct. 12.—
Rockne’s Fighting Team arrived
here at 8. this morning and went
immediately to the. Westchester-
Biltmore club, where they will. stay
till Saturday night. Joe Byrne, An-
gus McDonald and Rupe Mills are
taking care of the Rockmen and
have secured a band for Notre
Dame. All seats at Ebbets field
have been sold and a record crowd
will see the famous Notre Dame- ■.
Army clash tomorrow.
The Irish will wear green jerseys •
in the game.. .
The team worked out this after-
noon and are in fine condition for
the battle to-morrow. New York
writers have picked the Army to
triumph over Rockne’s aggregation
but the Irish are primed for fight
and •will offer a battle.tomorrow that
will be a classic in football history.
Rockne plans to use the passing
game from the start to make up for -
the weight advantage of the Army.
- - Woods, the'rArmy/halfback has -
been ; showing fine punting form
since the season began and the loss
of Breidster in the line will not be;
materially felt, as the Pointers be-
lieve that Ellinger will be capable
of filling the place. The remainder
of the line is composed of veterans.
Many . former students of Notre'
Dame came out to the club today to
see the team. Otherwise, every-
thing is'quiet. - ’
Rex Enright could not play polo ~
because he forgot his horse and Jim
Crowley doesn’t want to get up at
seven’ in the morning. Notre Dame
will win..	-	.

TEN-MINUTE SERVICE
The Northern Indiana Railway Company must be thanked for
putting another car on the Notre Dame line.and making it possible
to run on a ten minute basis.	>
The saving in time to the’ students who commute between South
Bend and Notre Dame is incalculable. The new schedule enables one
to get into the city minutes earlier and also to make better connec-
tions in the city.
Such a thing as time may not enter seriously into the minds of
some students but to others it is: of much consequence, especially to
those who hold jobs in South Bend and who cannot afford to waste
fifteen minutes .waiting for a car.
Therefore, it is altogether fitting and proper to say—Thank you.
THE DOME, GILDED
, Nothing has been more written about than the dome, and1 nothing
at Notre Dame is, therefore, more trite a subject. But'with its gilding;
the dome.again becomes a proper subject for discussion.
For generations its light lias been shed on the lives of men at
Notre Dame. In the morning it has caught the first rays of the sun
in the bursting eloquence of the new-born day. At noon the warmth
. of mellow sunlight has been’reflected from its midased surface. And
at evening, its resplendence has softened the shadows that move, across
the quadrangle. Its beauty has contained the music of unwritten words.
From this .fountain qL gold. the jeyes of a tender Mother - have
watched the deeds of youth, the valor of an elder age. To Her the
days have been as moments, the years as vanishing pictures. And the
. Mother has cherished every second a thought for the men who ? have
passed before her throne? Tomorrow, new faces, new hearts to glow,
new voices to offer prayer at her feet, but from Her always the same
love and tenderness. 7
From her outstretched hands and from the golden surface of her
throne, the golden light, at morning,’noon and evening, go forth the
courage for righteousness and the strength for purity. The rays- of
J gold symbolize the charity , and the love that She is sending -into the
hearts .of her. sons. The dome’of. yesterday, of today, of tomorrow is
always the same. And Notre Dame, what it has been, what it is,
what it will be, (is ever unchanged.	-
HOODA
Installment 3214
Which was correct: “We saw the
cat pause and then start again”; or
“We saw the cat’s paws and then
started again”?
It was beyond Hooda. He could-
n’t figure it out. Old Man English
had Hooda picking rosin out of his
shoulder blades again.
Or should it be: “The cat pawed
and then ran _ on”; or “the cats
paused and then ran”? Hooda had
never been paused (or is it pawed?)
by a cat. He was absolutely ig-
norant Of pausing (or is it paw-
ing?). To be sure, he had one
time strolled too close to a wild
cat’s cage and the creature had
made a thrust at him. And that
same night a lion had flown at him;
while later the same evening a tiger
had dived at him; and still later a
leopard had lunged s at him. But
even though he had been thrust at,
flown at, dived at, and lunged at,
he was none the wiser about being
pawed at.
He would see the dictionary—a
thing no respectable sophomore had
ever approabhed. He would see it,
nay read it, and if necessary, he
would even take pains to under-
stand it! He would set a prece-
dent, and take a chance.
His cheeks flushed with a mixture
of shame and devilishness, at what
he was about to do. He pulled
down-, the shades, plugged ,up the
key-hole; lowered the light a foot
or so, and advanced stealthily upon
the dictionary. He set his feet, put
out one wary hand and then jump-
ed. It had not hurt him. He grew
bolder and actually opened it. ’ It
did not scratch him."
. Half an hour later he took the
last remaining sheet from what had
been four full tablets.and wrote:
“The pussy cat made a temporary
cessation of inactivity, broke a
paragraph :into four-prolonged and
hideous eighth-notes, and then re-
sumed. (Note. The pussy cat was
a
’ CELEBRATIONS AND MUSIC
The year 1923 seems to be one of unlimited possibilities in the
way of celebrations. It is, for example, important as the fiftieth anni-
versary of the introduction of the typewriter. Just 900 years ago, how-
ever, there appeared an invention no less important than the compara-
tively recent invention of the typewriter, an invention which must be
regarded with interest by every musician and every lover ofv music.
What the inventor of the? typewriter did for the recording of words,
Guido, a Benedictine monk, did for the recording of music in 1023
by inventing the method of “writing” music on paper.
• To realize the importance of: Guido’s service to musical progress
it is necessary to consider the system of notation in use before his
time. For the most part music could then be circulated from one per-
son to another by ear only; that is, by humming or whistling the tune.
While in theoretical treatises the practice of the Greeks of employing
the first fifteen letters of the alphabet to designate the various intervals
was still in. use, ho means was at hand by which the intervals and
rhythm of a melody might be. graphically displayed so that anyone
might learn it from a manuscript without the aid of a master.
Early in his career Guido observed the confusion which prevailed
in the performance and the teaching of liturgical melodies generally.
In his endeavors to improve this condition he invented the system of
recording musical notes on lines in about the same form as modern
sheet music. The perfection of his new system brought order and
clearness into the teaching of music, and gave an impetus to its study
that lasted throughout the middle ages.
The world owes much to Guido, the Benedictine of Arezzo. And
the Catholic church, the true mother of progress, may claim through
the achievement of this monk a praiseworthy part in the development
bf music. It would, therefore, be proper for the musical organizations
of Notre Dame to give some public expression of their recognition of
and appreciation for, the discoveries of Guido.	’

He went on with his composition.

• The student body is urged to lend
all possible aid to a member of the
Pinkerton detective . agency who
will appear on and about .the cam?
pus the. latter part of this week.
His object here is to assist the in-
dividual who at, nine o’clock each
evening, gathers in force under our
window and creaks questions con-
cerning someone who is a.t the pres-
ent very gloomy and breaking some
sort of pledge or oath. The creak-
ing is''frequently punctuated with
notes.- At times the singer (?)
seems desirous of learning the ex-
act cause for his . shedding brine
about some other, as yet unknown,
person. The-singer (?) has even
ventured to assume that" in some
unknown time in the future some-
one will be enveloped ”with mel-
ancholia such as his. .The-mystery
may have to do with lumber or-coal
fields' for occasionally we., have
heard the words “mine” and “pine”
ripped.upon the night-air. Please

LaSalle—St. Elmo.
Blackstone—Drifting.
In “Drifting,” which’ is being
: x shown at the Blackstone for the last
time today, Priscilla Dean plays the
part of a girl who is engaged in the
opium traffic in China. Among her
' associates is Wallace Beery, who
seems to have a mortgage on the
villain u’oles in Priscilla Dean’s pro-
ductions. If the mortgage is per-
manent, so . much the better, - be-
cause, regardless of the peculiar
behavior of his eyes, he manages
to do some very good acting. Matt
Moore, whom you saw last, per-
haps, as Captain Apple jack, con-
tinues to add to his laurels as a se-
cret, service man who is detailed to
break up the opium ring. As you
might expect, he falls in love with
the fair, opium agent and demon-
strates the error of her ways. The
picture ends in a spectacular scene
in which the village is attacked by
the Janzhis, said attack being fol-
lowed by battle, murder and sud-
den death, which is stopped only
when the. omnipresent cavalry
comes to the rescue.
/ Of the added attractions at the
Blackstone the least said the better. -
Their saving grace was that they
were not long.
Walter O’Donnell, C.S.C., will sing
the mass.
The program for the choir is as
follows:
Processional ............ “Christ

Kyrie, Gloria, Sanctus, Benedictus
and Agnus Dei in four parts,
from the mass in honor of St. Ce-
celia by Ad. Kaim.

The new addition to the hospital
will increase its capacity over 150
beds. According to present plans
the activity of the institution will
be transferred to the new addition
and work started as soon as pos-
sible on remodeling the old part "to
conform with it. The institution
was outlined as follows: Formal
dinner dance during the Christmas
holidays for members only. An in-
formal dance at Easter, to be fol-
lowed by another in June, after the
close of the school year. In Sep-
tember a hard times dance will be
given.
The-constitution of the club was
reviewed during the meeting and
new articles and several amend-
ments were added.	” '
It is expected that a large dele-
gation of Indianapolis people will
be at Notre Dame for the Home-
coming celebration and the Butler
game. The club will endeavor to
present a fitting reception to the
Capital City visitors on both of
these occasions.

The same classic shapeliness —The same writing balance
New Parker D. Q.—Students’ Special, 03
WHEN you buy a Parker Pen of any
model, at any price, you are getting
a standard that never existed before the
Parker Duofold was created; and which
exists today only in the Parker make.
Parker’s lower priced black pens are like
Parker Duofold in everything save the size and
point. Yet even their points are tipped with
, NATIVE Tasmanian Iridium and polished
to the smoothness of a costly jewel bearing.
Only the Parker crafts-guild is trained to make Duo-
fold quality, and this same skill produces all other
Parker Pens too.
If you want the Over-size Pen with lacquer-red bar-
rel, flashing black tips and 25-year point—get Parker
Duofold, $7. (Duofold Jr., or Lady Duofold, $5.)
If you want Duofold’s classic lines and writing bal-
ance in a low-priced black pen of good size, get the
new Parker D. Q. specially made for stu-
dents, $3.
Any near-by pen counter, can supply you.
But be sure the pen is stamped “Geo. S. Par-
ker” if you want the new-day improvements.
The New Parker
D.Q. has large ring -

or pocket-clip free.

it to the gym with him today.
“Every man,” says Eddie,
“should know the cheers, and

with as much- alertness as ‘the men
on the field snap out the signals.
Let’s learn the cheers, and make
Notre Dame cheering better than
that of any other school.” .
The list follows:.
