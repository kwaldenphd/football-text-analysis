FIVE IRISH BOXERS
QUALIFY IN TOURNEY
McGowan and Miller in Finals;
Schell, Canny and Springer
Battle to Semi-finals.
Five of the squad of seven men
on the Notre Dame boxing team,
are still in the running for the Ken-
tucky-Indiana boxing champion-
ships. Danny McGowan, flyweight,
and “Rip” Miller, heavyweight,
have reached the finals in their
i classes, while Schell, welterweight,
Canny, middleweight, and Springer,
light-heavyweight, have succeeded
in reaching the semi-finals. The
Irish pugilists are making a strong
bid for several of the titles and it
is probable that-a few will be car-
ried off by the Notre Dame fighters.
The results of the fights in which
the Notre Dame boxers participated
are:	. -
Flyweight: Danny McGowan won,
decisively over, Sanders, of Louis- j
ville, and over Goodman, of Culver,
in the semi-finals.	।
Welterweight: Schearer kayoed
Reeves of the Hoosier A. C., in the!
preliminaries, but was disqualified
in the semi-finals while fighting1
Kepner, Hoosier A. C. Schell won
decision over Bennett, Hoosier A.
C., in his first bout and knocked out
Barker of the same club in the
semi-finals.
Middleweight: Canny easily de-
feated Estl, Hoosier A. C.
Heavyweight: Miller knocked
out Secrist, Gary, in the first round.
The tournament is being held in
Indianapolis' under the auspices of
the Hoosier Athletic club.
| Janies Swift, chairman of the |
i S. A.C., made the following an-j
| nouncement' yesterday afternoon!
1 in regard to the Junior Prom]
iprice:	J
The Editor:
Within the last week 'or so there
has been considerable discussion
relative to the S. A. C. dance rul-
ing regulating the price of class
functions and it appears'that there
is some opposition to such regula-
tion and considerable misunder-
standing concerning its history, its
purpose and its operation. It is
thought that an explanation of the
matter in all its phases will' ma-
terially aid in clearing up the mis-
understanding and in some measure
reduce the opposition to its opera-
tion.	.
In February, 1923, the S. A. C.
of that year entertained a motion
to limit the price of the various
class functions as follows: Ball,
$25;. Prom, $10; Cotillion, $5. At
this meeting the motion was tabled
and was not again entertained for
some three or four weeks, after
which time it was again discussed
and again tabled in order that the
individual members of the S. A. C.
might gather further student opin-
ion on the problem. At several
succeeding meetings the motion
was again entertained and each
time tabled because of the absense
of the president of the Senior class
as it was thought that action on
such a regulation in the absence of
the representative of the Senior
class -would be inadvisable. On
May 28th the regulation was passed
by the unanimous vote of the S. A.
C. and submitted to the Faculty
Dance Committee which organiza-
tion approved the bill, making it
operative with the functions\ of
1924.	■	'
The purpose of the legislation
was to stabilize the cost, to indi-
viduals, of the major class func-
tions in oijder that each member
of each class might look forward
to a definite expenditure and make
provisions for it in his personal
budget in ample time to permit of

CREIGHTON SCORES
ANOTHER VICTORY
Western Loop Aratists Defeat N. D,
23 to 12; Irish Fight Bitterly;
Kizer’s Absence Felt. -
Creighton University basketeers
triumphed over the Irish loop art-
ists in both games of the two game
series played at Omaha Friday and
last night. The western five de-
feated Notre Dame 29 to 23 in the
first game, and ran through the
। Keogan quintet to the tune of 23-12
'in the second engagement.
Notre Dame fought bitterly in
both contests, but was unable to
cope with the superior Creighton
five. Creighton’s experience and
skillful players proved too much for
the fighting Maylmen.
. The. absence of Noble Kizer, star-
guard “and consistent“scorer,~~ was
partly responsible for the defeats.
The largest crowds that have ever I
turned out' to see basketball games

MANY CLUBS LOSE HUNDREDS OF VOTES THRU THEIR FAILURE TO
GET SIGNATURES; OHIO AND DANTE CLUBS FINISH IN
SECOND PLACES; CONTEST EDITOR SWAMPED WITH
BALLOTS; FACULTY BOARD ANNOUNCED.
The NOTRE DAME DAILY’S Best-Organization Contest has ended.
The
Scribblers has won the first place in the Campus Class with a total '
of 2076 votes. The Toledo Club leads all in the Home class with a ballot
of 2709 votes. Close on the heels of The Scribblers is the Dante Club,
with a total of 1866 votes. , The Ohio Club follows the Toledo Club with
j a vote of 1887.
I ' The closing moments of the contest were tense. Thousands of bal-
lots poured into the room of the contest editor about 5:30 p. m. Satur-
day. At 6 o’clock the contest formally closed, and the counting began
It was quickly discovered that many of the clubs had withheld to the
last minute votes , and proxy lists that were altogether worthless, be-
cause the signatures of the voters were not attached. The Ohio Club
had worthless proxy lists that totalled approximately 5500 votes; the
Monogram Club, 4250 vote; The Scribblers, 2000 votes; the Glee Club,
600 votes; the Toledo Club, 500 votes; the Dante Club, 400 votes; the ,
Chicago'Club, 350 votes; the Rocky Mountain Club and Villagers, about
300 votes apiece.	. ‘
The Faculty Contest Board quickly'ruled out all proxy lists that
were not signed by the individual voters.
The faculty Contest Board, acting upon the matter last night, re-
stated the rule that all proxy lists to which those who delegated their
ballots did not attack their signatures, were null and void. - This ruling
was nothing new, as it had been published in The DAILY both times
proxies were mentioned, namely, in the issue of February 14 and Feb-
ruary 21. To quote: “Proxies may therefore be secured on petitions,
providing the official form is presented, and signatures are .attached.”

NEWS-TIMES WIRE.) — Coach
Harry Gill’s well balanced track
team scored an- easy victory over
the proteges of Coach Rockne,
72 1-3 to 22 2-3, in the Armory
here last night.
The Fighting Illini landed two or
three men in every event except
two,, and in the high jump and 300-
yard dash, bettered the Illinois Re-
lay Carnival record in these events.
The Suckers made a clean sweep
of the 75-yard dash, quarter mile
and 75-yard high hurdles. Notre
Dame took first place in the half
mile and the broad jump when Bar-
ber and Livergood scored wins.
Wagner came in third in the 880
yard dash. Kennedy and Wendland
annexed second places; Milbauer
was a close second in the shot put,
and Harrington placed third in the
high jump. ;

The members of the Faculty
Contest Board—the personnel of
which has not been, announced till
this time for obvious reasons—who
took this action were Father Wal-
ter O’Donnell, C. S. C., and Father
Patrick Haggerty, C. S. C. The
third member of the board, Profes- y
sor Paul Fenlon, is at present away
from the university. _	_ _
" 'Not' long-after the contest start-
ed the members of certain organiza-
tions were told that they could cast
individual ballots each day without
a man’s true signature being at-
tached, provided that on the day of
the contest’s closing they presented
the signature of the man whose bal-
lots they had been casting, in order ( %
to prove that they had been auth-
orized by him to cast those ballots.
As certain organizations who took
advantage of this failed to offer the
signature to substantiate the bal-
lots already cast, the number of
these unsubstantiated ballots were
removed from the totals of these
clubs.
This explains -why some clubs
have not as many votes at the close-
of. the contest as they had the day
before the last ballot.
The winners will receive the two
monstrous silver loving cups, the
gifts of Dr. Stoeckley, which have\
for some time been displayed in the
cafeteria.

RIGHT OFF THE CHEST, Nellie Revell.
Doran; New York.	. "
Several of the new books pub-
lished by Doran within the last few
months are of interest chiefly be-
cause of thir interesting authors.
Not that the works are not ad-
mirable in themselves; some have
been, and of this group “Right Off
;the Chest,” by Nellie Revell, is a
good example. Miss Revell suffered
an injury to her. spine five' years
ago which has; ever since confined
her:to St. Vincent’s hospital, New
York, in a plaster cast. Before
this: she was the best newspaper
woman in New York, characterized
in the journalistic world as, “a
damn good newspaper man.”, .
In this book Miss Revell makes
the astonishing statement that her
back has been photographed oftener
than. Kitty Gordon’s and when one
reads the treatments she has sub-
mitted to her statement .is proved.
There is a hint of plaintiveness in'
this otherwise “snicker side out”
book when she makes this interro-
gation,
OUR “ALL-NOTRE DAME PLAY”
The Dramatic Club, too long waiting back-stage, has finally
stalked forth and presented “Americans,” its first play of- the year.
The fact that’this play was well written by a .Notre Dame undergrad-
uate, that it was well presented by the members of the Dramatic Club,
and that it was weir directed by Notre Dame’s dramatic instructor,
lifts it from the mediocrity of just a Washington hall play to the dis-
tinction: of being an unusually successful “All-Notre Dame” produc-
tion. :	'	-
The play “Americans,” it is hoped, is but the first’ work of this
year’s Dramatic Club. .Notre Dame possesses the men, playwrights,
actors, directors; it remains now for.greater achievements. The next
venture of the. Notre Dame dramatic, group upon the Washington hall
boards is awaited with prideful interest.	"

SUCCESS IS FAILURE :
A wise man is happy in misery. Being/conipounded. of imperfec-
tions, he. always strives toward perfection - and, happily, he never
reaches it because perfection, for him, is failtire. - The philosopher is
always chasing .truth and like the will-of-the-wisp,: it constantly
eludes him. Only the fool believes he has captured the elusive abstrac-
tion, , truth, - and only the fool would delude ‘ himself .by. feeling he is
happy in the supposed capture. The real artist finds joy in.pursuing
the intangible concept of beauty. “He deals with the great infinite, and
avoids the finite'that pleases lesser minds like those of: his commercial
brethren. - He realizes that; the infinite can :never be compassed by his
. finite self, though his soul can strive to apprehend, and yet never com-
prehend, the infinite. .The infinite, being unattainable^ is his proper
subject, for the infinite can never be cursed by satisfaction. While he
-seeks to sate a thirst that can never be sated, the fool drinks of "finite
waters; becomes drunk with'satiety, and numbs his real self, the soul.
Alexander was happy while he was conquering the world; but when his
finite end was accomplished .he sighed for there were “no more worlds
to.conquer.” Love is never, satisfied, though lust can be sated. Failures
are successes. By'them continuous struggle/is possible. While we.are
mortals, God never permits us to know him. ‘ He lets us have glimpses
of his magnificence, but never, does he satisfy'our hope, for knowledge
of him until, dead, our soul, freed- from .finite limitations, is- able to
realize and repose in infinity. -. ;:
...The static man who IbBs.	wealth is a failure, the strug-
gling man, be.,he as miserable as Job; or as lacking in money;as -the
poorest pauper, is. a.success, for he is.rich in the growth of what is most
glorious, in him, the-soul.- .	' •	'•

“Notre Dame’s Ellis Island.”
That’s the title once conferred on
the yearlings .“cardboard palace.”
There: were some' that claimed the
phrase was undeserved; so we will
let the reader judge for himself.
Several weeks before, as already!
related in this paper, Mah Jongg,'
.the Chinese- pastime, became the
serious business of the , hall. Pat-
rons of the game even began tak-
ing-on the customs and dress of its
originators. Mahderin caps and
loose sleeved robes became the eve-
ning- style and passersby" greeted
one another in the approved Sax
Rohmer style : It. was a time of soft
rustling curtains; sibilant whisper-
ings and shuffling : gait. But the
craze was too intense’ to last long;
Paper caps of- weird* design were
satisfying enough, but they were
not very durable,'and then: there
was the danger of the rest, of the
campus getting wind of the whole
affair. And so the-interest in the
game waned and Mah Jongg was
doomed?-	. ;	;
' And yet the, impressionable fresh-
men were dissatisfied. Poker had
lost the charm of pre-Jongg days;
the rising class. of “27.” demanded,
a new pastime; .	- :
Then by chance ' some ; studious
youth came across an old and musty
tome that described with . many
quaint details the ancient and. royal
game of India. The romance - of
the ’ game caught the fancy of the
yearlings; its obscurity gave tit. the
appeal of novelty. ’ Promoters of
the game were thorough in exploit-
ing- it. They organized: a tourna-
ment on a huge scale. .
■ . With imaginations fired, they fell:
naturally.into.their roles; now they;
are- gray bearded Hindus, clad in
regal-garments and with heads bent
over the multi-lined board. Thus
did the inmates welcome Parchesi
to Freshman hall. ?.
, It .was during the final' stages of
the tourney that an incident occur7
red that was to arrest the progress-
of this second craze. . A. particular
contest had reached a critical stage.
The audience was large, and the
trophy to be gained was .of no. mean

Alfred A. Knopf reannounces the
important- works of Willa Cather,
the Pulitzer Prize winner of 1922.
These works: include, “A Lost
Lady,” still sharing with “Black
Oxen” the foremost position in the
list of “best sellers,” “One of
Ours,” the novel that won the Pu-
litzer Prize for her, “Youth and the
Bright Medusa,” a collection of
stories of American life; and a col-
lection of poems, entitled, “April
Twilight.” Surely a list of work to
be proud of; Willa Cather’s career
is one of the most enviable of mod-
ern .writers.	-

The Freeman- announces that it
will suspend publication in the near
future, which may or may not. cause
a sigh of regret here. Speaking of
the possibility of continuing, the
Freeman says editorially:
“Many attempts were, made to
secure a reasonable-increase of sub-
scribers, including costly conven-
tional advertising. and intensive
promotion. Friends and circulation
‘experts’ who were consulted offered
feasible suggestions, but every sug-
gestion. was based on a different
Freeman than the one the editors
were making. If we had adopted
the ’ suggestions the circulation
might-have gone up a few tens of
thousands,: but the Freeman would
have lost its soul—and the adher-
ence of those who mourn over it
today.” Losing one’s soul implies
many unpleasant things for the fu-
ture; maybe it is just as well that
the Freeman knows when to quit
while it has ' an opportunity to in-
herit the happy hunting grounds—
the - reward of souls that are not
lost.

Editor, NOTRE DAME DAILY:
Once in a blue moon.there is pre-
sented in almost any college of pre-
tentious size, a-. dramatic effort
worthy: of the . term “distinctive.”
Such an effort is “Americans,”
which was presented in Washing-
ton hall Friday night under the
auspices of the Drama club. >
-How so much histironic talent
could be found in any one college
student-body is a mystery. True,
here and there shrill notes of a
juvenile voice tended to dispel the
atmosphere of dignity, but for the
most part, characters were played
jwith sincerity and capability little
short of astonishing. This was es-
pecially true of the principals.
The coloring of the costuming
and the sets of the- picturesque type
gave splendid background for the
players as they moved about
through the play.
That there is an abundance of
material for dramatic productions
at Notre Dame was convincingly
exemplified Friday night. The
presentation of the AU-Notre Dame
play “Americans” proved the ab-
surdity of the recent thought of
having another university present a
play here.
The work of Mark Nolan, as Al-
exander Hamilton, was particularly
good. Every man in the cast played
his part well. All the characters
were adapted to their roles.
Enthusiastically,
RALPH G. GLADEN.
What Others-Say
Just then the automobile whirled
around a corner where before an
audience of three tiny tots, no
more than three years old, the ex-
act group of musicians desired was
playing. To the astonished sere-
naders they were whirled into Mr.
King’s big limousine, transported to
■the garden wall and apparently
without their even knowing what
it was all about, filmed.
This scene is one of the many
unusual bits of local* color which
make “The White Sister” the finest
example of how natural background
can be utilized in making the mo-
tion picture more realistic.
finally reap compensation for her
ruined life.
This production plays upon the
heartstrings of the audience, as the
old Irish bards wrung tunes from
their harps in Tara’s halls. The
plot is extremely original, and may
! be classified as a romantic tragedy.
The emotional element is creditably
1 done by Lillian Gish. In the many
souhwracking scenes, where she
might, have so easily become maud-
lin, she uses “a fine discretion, which
yields a very artistic result. Ron-
ald Colman, playing opposite Miss
Gish, gives a brilliant performance,
especially noteworthy for his pow-
ers of facial expression.

When Henry King, in Italy, be-
gan production of that part of “The
White Sister,” in which Angela,
played by. Lillian Gish, escapes
from the watchful eye of her gov-
erness to meet her lover, he found
that the script called for the use of
a. group of street musicians.
Angela was to dance to the music
of the .mandolin and - accordion,
away from'her governess and over
the garden wall, to meet her lover.
I “I wonder where we will get
street musicians,” Mr. King asked
his assistant as he drove out. to lo-
cation that morning. “Do you sup-
pose we will have to hire some?”

THE RUB DOWN
By TOM COMAN
The manly art of ^boxing, the
sport of kings, will have to stand
trial in the state legislature of New
York at the coming session. For
many years, Fistiana has been in
some very embarrassing positions
from time to time due to the work
of unscrupulous managers and
money-mad promoters. Occasion-
ally an accident occurs and a host
of reformers gather around the as-
sembly halls at Albany and yell like
demons for the repeal of the meas-
ure which makes boxing possible in
New York.
The Democrats sponsored the
life-giving bill in the first place and
since they rule one-half of the New
York legislature, the Republicans
are angling around seeking to cor-
ner a stray Democrat and tell him
the ill effects of this boxing sport
in the state. The Democrats are
still supporting the boxing measure
but with a little less whole-hearted-
ness .than they did formerly. If.
another scandal in the roped arena
suddenly appears on the horizon,
there would be a fire sale of box-
ing gloves on Broadway.
The suit of Joe Jackson against
the Chicago White Sox for back
pay took-a sudden turn in the op-
posite direction last Thursday when
Jackson was placed under arrest
for perjury. Two days previous,
the same decision was clamped on

make track as popular a major
sport as it once was on the Midway;
“Boost Track” is their slogan and

arranged.

his attendance without .financial
sacrifice. The price of each func-
tion has shown an annual increase
in the past and it was believed that
such increase would eventually lead
to the exclusion of a majority of the
class personnel because of financial
reasons. The purpose of all class
functions being entertainment for
the. entire class, such exclusion is
radically wrong and contrary to the
principles of student activity at
Notre Dame. Upon this basis the
S. A. C. of 1923, acting in accord-
ance with such student'opinion as
it was able to obtain, recommended
this? measure to the Faculty Dance
Committee of that year which com-
mittee incorporated it into - the
rules and regulations^ governing
University dances.
As has ben said before, the reg-
ulation became operative with the
functions of. this year and has been
complied -with in the one instance
to date, namely, the Sophomore Co-
tillion. 'It was the intention of
both the S. A. C. and the Faculty
Dance Committee, at the time' the
legislation became a part of the
rules. and regulations governing
