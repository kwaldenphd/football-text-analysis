Editors
J - Questionnaires have been issued:.to
members of the graduating class by
the officers of the 1924 Dome. The
officers say that additional ques-
tionnaires can be obtained at the off-
campus office and. from the dean of
the Law School. Return of the
questidnaires to Box 82 dr to 303
Walsh hall is asked for immedi-
ately.
. Space on the questionnaires is left
for the seniors to iridicate their ac-
tivities', and'honors in scholarship,
sport and campus life. / - r
- Photographers from the Russell
Studio, of Chicago,,-will begin to
take senior- and other; pictures
October 9. "Those-who are to be
photographed will be notified, and
if they fail to appear within the
time sht/nd"allowance will be made.
The. same studio x'riiade /scenery
photographs during the spring for
the 1924 Dome. The pictures are
said , to be the best ever taken at'
the University. ,	A : •
Meetings ’ of the' editorial, busi-
ness and art staffs are being held
regularly./ Rev.. Bernard Lange,
who has been away from/the Uni-
versity for the past year, has re-
turned, and will assist in the art
work. The art staff of this year ap-
pears to be unusually. large and
capable. ../..///
/ The printing contract will be' let
within the week, it is said. Engrav-
ing work for the aririual was award-
ed to; the Pontiac Engraving com-
pany of Chicago; last spring.- ' /-
Circulation figures already exceed
those of any previous year. r .
The Notre Dame-Army game is to
be fought out on October 13, as
scheduled, but just where this con-
test shall take place still reriiains a
mystery.
Much has been said about playing
the game at Stagg Field, Chicago,
because it would give the Confer-
ence fans a chance to see both
teams in action. But the City Ser-
ies baseball games have been over-
looked by those . who make these
predictions., There is a great pos-
sibility that these; baseball games
would detract greatly from the in-
terest of the/ Notre.. Dame-Army
fray.
A; rumor received late last even-
ing, however, seems to carry some
weight.; It 2 is that the National
League Ball ; Grounds, at Ebbet’s
Field, Brooklyn, N. Y., is now be-
ing considered seriously for the bat-
tle ground../	.
STRICT RULES

Must Wait Fifteen Minutes for Prof
' Only Certain Number of
Cuts Permitted
'• Regulations in regard to 2 ab-
serices, from classes, as announced
by the.Department of Discipline, are
rriore strict this year than last. Only
those, “cuts” which a student accu-
mulates‘while absent in the com-
mon interest of thei.University may.
becanceled;' '^Absences’7: “inS the
commori interest of . the University,”
it -is said, will include absences for
athletic contests, debating,. and the
likes. < ;	'	. X "	- i
, Students . going home for - vaca-
tion-must, not leave before the spe-
cified /time, and must return for
classes' immediately after the re?
cess or they will be: penalized. Any
absence on the. last day before, or
the. first day . after, Christmas,'
Easter or Thanksgiving vacations
will be penalized by.a double “cut.’’
Three tardinesses, or brie tardi-
-ness of fifteen minutes; of riiore, will
constitute a ' “.cut.” Classes are au-;
tomatically dismissed if ;the in--
structor does not report within fif-;
teen- minutes after- the time- for
opening the class. . >	2	<
. The2 number of .cuts allowed is
three times the number of hours in
the. course. - Thus a student may
absent ..himself from . classes for
three weeks.- Any. “cuts” beyond
this limit, however, makes it neces-
asry for him to drop the course. •

OLD FRIENDS AND NEW
.Perhaps it is presumptions for the. youthful Notre Dame Daily
to voice a welcome to the student body at the beginning of the new
school year, for it is itself a newcomer. Yet, to those returning up-
per classmen who assisted so loyally in the test publication last
.spring, and to the many freshmen whose support is essential for the
.continuation .of the paper, the Daily wishes to express its pleasure
in the renewal and the formation of acquaintance. Unexpected de-
lays ih' the initial publication of the year haye made this greeting of
the Daily somewhat -tardy, but they have not detracted from its
sincerity.
.	- Because ’of the fact. that subscriptions have failed to fulfil ex-
-pectations, the Daily will be issued on four days only instead of on
five days,-as was originally intended. It is hoped, however, that an
increased circulation in the near future will make possible the pub-
lication of an additional issue each week.	•
Regardless of the number of issues, the Daily desires to place
itself at the service of its friends old and new, and to express the
hope that, its readers will find it .worthy of their support. There is
.every reason to-believe that during the coming' year a daily news-
paper can do much for Notre Dame, providing that.it has the co-
operation of the student body. And it is with confidence that the
Daily will have that co-operation that the members of the staff have
begun their work for the year.	-	,	.
But for all that, Hooda was
afraid of 'a rip. That horrible,
tearing sound so dreaded by all
men and so dear to the ears of- a
tailor. That awful, sickening rend-
ing that makes stronger men than
Hooda seek haven. The appalling,
sneaking “snick” that tells of good
cloth gone wrong. That—but wait!
His mind . was made up. He
stooped—
Hooda: “And what are the costs,
please?”
Tailor: “We had-to take eight
stitches. One dollar, please.”
* * * .
But Hooda must be excused. Hu
was standing on the wrong street
when, he committed his perfidy. It
has since been suggested that it
never would have happened on
South Bend’s street ( of logic,
Col-fax.

SCHOLARSHIP
DANCES BEGIN
From Off Stage
Twelve Scholarships Given by South
’ Bend Women Last -
. Year.
• The first Scholarship dance of the
year, one of a series to be given by
the Scholarship club, was held in the
ball room of the Tribune building
Friday evening. ;	-
The Scholarship jlub was organ-
ized'to assist worthy men to obtain
an education at the University, and
^also to -provide entertainment for
the students during the school year.
The club membership is composed
of 30 women of South Bend and
Mishawaka.
Money realized at the dances will
be spent for scholarships given to
“deserving young men, who come to
- the University highly recommended
by. their former instructors, and
who, as well as the professional and
business men of their home towns,
are still interested in them.”
The club was'organized two years
ago, and plans other dances for this
year. The young women invited are
from representative families of
South Bend and Mishawaka.
Two scholarships were awarded

The past week has been notable
for the quality of attractions which
have been shown in South Bend
theatres. Lois Wilson and Elliott
Dexter at the Orpheum in “Only
Thirty-Eight” made as engaging a
pair of - middle-aged lovers as you
have ever seen. The performance
at the Palace was much as usual.
One thing, however, is worthy of
mention, that is the work of Snitz
Edward and of Walter Long who
played in The supporting cast of Col-
leen Moore’s picture, “The Hunt-
ress,” which was billed for the first
half of the week. Their cleverness
did much to account for whatever
success the film attained. ■	•
At the La Salle, the gorgeous
Gloria Swanson did the best she
could with a role, which was meant
for Ina Claire, that of “Bluebird’s
Eighth Wife.” . “Brown’s Saxo-
phone Six” at the Blackstone proved
an attraction which appealed to
those who enjoy the eccentricities
of the most eccentric of musical
instruments. “If Winter Comes,”
the current attraction at the Oliver,-
is a picture well worth seeing, and
one which brings much credit to
Harry Millarde, the director, and to
Percy Marmont, who plays Mark
Sabre. Mr. Marmont is a hard
working, intelligent actor of far
more than ordinary ability, who, for
the first time in years is receiving
his due. It is hoped that “If Win-
ter Comes” will do for Marmont
what “The Four Horsemen of the
Apocalypse” did for one much less
worthy.	...

z This is a great-pen for college
men and women! It is x made by
the makers of Eversharp pencil. I
It has a huge ink capacity I Andj
the Wald, filling device fills it plumb
full every time. It’s <a big pen.
But it is so nicely, balanced and pro-u
portioned that it fits into the fist most‘
comfortably.
The Wahl Signature. Pen writes the'
instant the point touches paper; The
ink begins to flow evenly — always
enough, never too much. The • pat-
ented comb feed makes shaking un-
- necessary. .	.
The everlasting nib is a wonder. .
Experts say it is the ultimate in
nib-making. It suits itself to any .
hand—to any style. It is extra
heavy. The 14-karat gold is tipped
with the hardest and finest grade
of iridium that money can buy.
The patented construction of the
cap makes it impossible.for the pen to .
leak in the pocket. The cap cannot
split, for it is strengthened by the plain
gold band. There are two sizes of the

women, and one at $7 for men! Other

VARSITY MAUL
FROSH ELEVEN
_ Irish Show Form in Open Scrifn’-
mage; Castner at Game at
■ Cartier Field ,
The Irish met Irish and brother
met brother in the annual Varsity-
Freshman football clash on Cartier
■ field yesterday afternoon, which in-
formally opened the 1923 grid sea-
son at Notre Dame.
. . The yearlings, playing together
for the first time, displayed remark-
able ability at judging and breaking
. up plays, knocking down passes and
general defense work. - Bielli,- a
product of Danny Coughlin’s from
Duluth, looked good, at tackle for
-the Fresh.* Murrin, an All-Star
. center from Parkersburg, W. Va.,
/played an aggressive game at that
• position. Chet Wynne and George
- Vergara were both .well represented
by younger brothers-on the Fresh-
man squad.	...
In the last half of the game, Keo-
gan, the Freshman coach, sent Ed-
- words into the fray at quarter.
■ ' Edwards, who conies from Weston,
Va., played a good offensive and
defensive game, and showed up well
- — on knocking down passes.
' The varsity first'string, starting
the game brought, back to life the
echoes of last year’s brilliant cam-
.. paign. .	'	. -
Harvey Brown, the fighting cap-
tain and Kizer at' the guards,
< smashed thru the Frosh line almost
< at will and .smothered the green-
s ' jerseyed backs before they ' could
get started. Walsh at center,
Stange, Oberst and “Rip” Miller at
- the tackles, Vergara and Mayi on
the wings, slashed through the
- Freshman’defense with ease.
Don Miller got away for long
runs and scooped in some nice
passes. Crowley, Livergood, Car-
. .. riey, Bergman and Maher displayed
their usual snappy brand football.
Harry; Stuhldrehr, “the little gen-
eral,” beginning -his ./second- year
with the Irish warriors, proved a
master at all times.. *
. James/ Layden, Regan- and Ma-
ge vney were unable to get into , the
game because of minor injuries.
. A large delegation of South Bend
rooters were in the stands to wit-
ness the opening fray. Paul Cast-
ner, triple threat fullback .on last
year’s aggregation, was also pres-
ent.	..	. ..
