ORGANIST PLEASES
LARGE AUDIENCE
WITH RECITAL
dr. J. LEWIS BROWNE, ASSIST-
ED BY SARA McCABE,
AND GLEE CLUB
. , By Norbert Engles
Dr. J. Lewis Browne, eminent or-
ganist, choral conductor, and com-
. poser, of Chicago, and a member
of the faculty of the. School of mu-
sic at Notre Dame, gave an artistic
and appealing concert in Sacred
; Heart Church. Sunday evening. He
, was assisted by Sara McCabe, so-
prano, of Chicago, and the Glee
club, . with Joseph Casasanta con-
ducting.
Well Attended
The beautiful church was filled
with people eager to hear a com
cert of the standard promised by.
the name of Dr. Browne, and from
the first crashing thunder of Bach’s
Prelude in C minor, to the last dy-
ing tones of De Koven’s Recessional,
their faces were alight, and intent
upon the flow of amazing technique
and interpretation that sounded to
their, ears.	,	.
Dr.'Browne Is Master
Dr. Browne is an artist of the
first rank, and his playing is the re-
sult of long years of study with the
foremost teachers of America and
Europe. 1 Every phase was handled
with the same sensitive treatment;
every touch to the manuale was the
' signal to the powerful pipes to
pour out their utmost 'in tone and
color. The result was an over-
whelming demonstration of mas-
tery.	'
. -MissMcCabe_Charms_Audience.
Sara -McCabe is undoubtedly one
of the future prima donnas ' of
America, for already her voice sur-
passes many on the concert stage.
With a charming personality that is.
reflected in. every tone, this youth-
ful Jenny Lind .has a bright future
in store for her. '
; Glee Club Does Well —
The Glee club seemed, inspired by
the flow of artistry about it, for it
outdid itself in< “0 Bone Jesu,” by
Palestrina, the first great master
of sacred songs. In-“The Reces-
sional,” by De Koveri, its work was
splendid; arid; enriched as it was
by the voice of. Miss McCabe, and
accompanied by Dr. Browne on the
organ, left nothing wanting to. the
audience. It was a fitting close to
great concert, combining all .three
features into ofie' to produce a gi-
gantic conclusion. •_

Laetare Medal Is One of The Highest
Distinctions Given to Catholic Laymen
The Laetare medal, which.will.be
presented to Charles Doriagh Ma-
giniss sometime this year, will be
the forty-second one that has been
presented. ' It was originated in

the idea. ■ . ..
The object of the; medal is to
promote a better spirit of service
for the Catholic church among the
Catholic laymen of America, and it
has succeeded in its.purpose. It
has become nationally known and
even in the latest edition of Webs-
ter’s dictionary it is; mentioned.
The press of the country devotes
quite a bit of space to the presen-
tation of the honor, and the Cath-
olic press in particulay is en-
thused over the plan. • It is at pres-
ent one. of the biggest honors that
a Catholic layman may obtain. ■

gation was expelled from France ‘
he came; to the United States arid
was appointed professor . of■ theol-
ogy at the Scholasticate of . the
Province of the United States, Holy
Cross college, Washington, D. _ ,C.
He taught theology for 12 years,

nary teacher of this subject in the
country. Later he became profes-
sor of Philosophy at the’ Catholic
University of America in Washing-
ton, D. C.
Served During War

THE. DAILY’S STAND FOR NOTRE DAME
.A union building to be built as soon as possible.
A well-organized student body, residing on the campus.
True recognition and appreciation of good scholarship.
THE PACIFIST MOVEMENT
/ Under, the pointed headline “They’ll Only Need a ’ One Way
Ticket,”-' the following- communication recently appeared in the col-
umns of a Chicago paper:
• RHL: It. is remarkable how the use of a little
* common sense and forethought will dispose' of our
'■ ; most irritating problems. This annoying Brent Dow -
Allinson case, for instance. See how easy it is. Get
.. Brent Dow and the immortal 38 to visit Notre Dame, ,
make the regulation speech and hiss the flag, and
. .. the matter will be immediately settled—permanent-
. ;	ly.—iHam;	...
. Every student should take pride , in having'Notre Dame’s
thus made clear. ^The^gldrious traditions of patriotism and loyalty
which have been founded by so many sons of Notre Dame insure her
stand
place.ever among the front ranks of staunch defenders of the flag.
This seems to be well-recognized by the world at large.
“For God and Country” has long been instilled into the hearts of
Notre Dame men; in the classroom, in Washington Hall, in private
conversation with priests and lay faculty members, the Notre Dame
student'has always been deep-filled with the sense of his loyalty.
; Notre Dame has her Colonel Hoynes, grand old hero, of the Civil
War; she does not forget Father Corby, blessing the Union troops at
Gettysburg, nor can: she help holding in memory, the patriotic service
of the noble band of brothers and priests who formed the Notre Dame
post of the G. A. R., but who have now nearly all passed3 away. In
the World War, Notre Dame gave of her priests-to act as chaplains;
she.gave thousands of her students and alumni to the army; she laid
forty-three of her sons upon-the altar of patriotism-as sacrifices of
loyalty.	< -	.	■
The student body might pledge itself to support the flag but it is
not necessary—these have pledged forever this university by the lakes.
For, just as sure as there is. a flag beside the steeple, cutting the sky
over Notre Dame, there will ever be a united Notre Dame student body
ready to go the limit for Uncle Sam!
APRIL FOOL’S DAY
zi .-It is the first of April; or/as this particular day has been known
/for/generations, it is April Fool’s Day. When we reflect for a few
moments we recall in the years past, especially in our early childhood,
how we'planned and schemed for days, hoping to concoct soine. means
by which we could deceive’our friends, and then yell “April fool” when
' they fell xvictims to our petty intrigues.. We- actually became over-
joyed‘when this particular day approached,, because we anticipated the
( . fun. \ve-would have making a fool of these friends.
That was in our^ childhood. Unfortunately, however, a college
education always'has not been sufficient to. eradicate from one’s char-
acter those childlike traits that deprive a fellow, of good common sense
throughout life, and make him a big fool in the' eyes of his fellowmen.
This is( so because there are always those who believe that simply
because'they have been exposed to a college environment they are en-
titled to be classed .among the thinkers,; the clear-headed, the broad-
minded, and the individuals who are motivated by common sense. And
likecin their childhood, they are deceiving themselves by trying to de-
ceivej others, not having matured enough to realize that the greatest
fool; is he who believes everyone else-tb be one. r .
’/ Yes, it is April Fool’s Day, but for some the first of April comes
three hundred sixty-fiye days each year.: : '
A college doesn’t make fools dr bright men, it merely develops
them. A fool is. a. fool .whether he goes to college or not, but he’ll
probably be a; different kind of a fool after he gets through.
Some of us learn the value of truth by going to church. Most of
us/however, learn its value by having to do business with liars. ...
tHat the man who has never been
criticized, in ..this „ world is the man who has . never done anything
worth while.	. . u i ,	. b
THE OPEN FORUM
To the Editor of the DAILY:
I am sending you under sepa-
rate cover a copy of “Scoutcraft”
in which I read a letter from a
young man student of Notre Dame
to his father on the anniversary of
his birth. It seemed such a won-
derful letter that I thought I
would send this copy to you to.pub-
lish if you wished. I think it would
have a wonderful influence among
the other scholars, many of them
think just the way this young man
does but cannot express themselves
that way. The young man who
wrote this letter is in his third year
at Notre Dame.
Yours truly,
DANIEL HERLIHY.
The letter referred to is as fol-
lows :
Dear Father:
Your birthday, your day of days is
present, and may God bless the man whom
I look up to as the greatest man I ever
knew.
Some fellows never had the good luck
to have a father like you, while other fel-
lows have had fathers almost as good,
and did not appreciate them. I may not
seem as appreciative as other sons; but I
am with you whole heartedly and I know
whatever you say is right. If a fellow
only follows his father’s words, he would
be a good man, and one worthy of having
his father’s name. The trials and troubles
a son brings to his father are many, and
fathers have a way' of helping a son out
of many difficulties. You have always
done more than your share for all of
your family.
Happiness is the end for which men
strive; some through wealth, others’
through power. Our great happiness came
not through power or wealth, but through
our everlasting -love of our home and
family ties.
Our home was. supreme,, nobody had
such a love for family as each, and every
one. of us. All were brought up to love,
and respect our brothers and sisters, and
in this manner we tried to follow the ex-
ample you and mother set for ,us. Your
great love, instilled in all of us, led us to
be good, honest, and God-fearing people.
’ When one looks back, one can imagine
your mother and father on this day hop/
ing that some day their baby boy would
be head of a family of contented people
whose name is clear and clean and whose
sons will be proud to carry their name
through -any field of endeavor, keeping it
up io the standard you have set.
Your youngest boy, and all his buddies
at Notre Dame wish you health and hap-
piness for many more years; that they
may all meet you more often, and. know
you better. ,	■	,
May God bless you with many kind
wishes and happiness ,ori this your birth-
day. May you have many more birthdays,
and hoping I may be with you to shake
your hand with a hearty • “Good Luck.’’
YOUR SON.

“Icebound” is a clever story,
screened in an excellent manner,
with a very good cast. It is not in
the least thrilling, and contains none
of those episodes during which the
onlooker has to strain his imagina-
tion to the danger point. It is a
story of ordinary human beings,
woven in a way that is excellently
true to life, with a conspicuous ab-
sence of unnecessary heroism and
superhuman feats.
No detail has been slighted, the
settings are well' chosen, and* the
cast fits the story in a way that sug-
gests painstaking care in the selec-
tion. Richard Dix and Lois Wilson
are the stars, and have seldom giv-
en better performances.—P. C. M.

I HAVE ever considered it as the indispensable
duty of every member of society to promote, as
far as in him lies, the prosperity of every indi-
vidual, but more especially of the communitv in
which he belongs.” v
Life insurance is inseparably bound up with the
prosperity of every individual, family ahd community?
It is a secure and prosperous business and satisfactory
to the salesman in every way.
The John-Hancock would like to interest a few
ambitious men who graduate this year to make John
Hancock selling, their life work.
Statistics on college graduates who have entered
life insurance place it at the very top as a source of
income. Before making a decision as to your career
/ ' it would be well to make inquiries of the “Agency

Cancelled by Keogan
NOTRE DAME v RELAY TEAMS
WILL FACE YALE AND
MICHIGAN SQUADS
After the opening of the outdoor
season in a dual meet with De
Pauw, the Notre Dame track team
will begin a series, of important
nieets and special relay games that
will introduce Rockne’s track stars
into some of the fastest track com-
petition in the country.
One week after the engagement
at Greencastle, the Blue and Gold
aggregation will be represented at
the Cleveland Interscholastic indoor
track carnival by a two-mile team
and a one-mile team that will com-
pete against the crack relay teams
of: eastern and middle western
schools. The one mile team will
carry the baton against Yale, Syra-
cuse and Princeton, .while the two
inile team will enter the lane
agqinst Ohio State, Michigan and
Ames. Wayne Cox, Notre Dame’s
sensational half-miler, will run a
special race with Conger, the
Princeton middle distance star.
The following week-end, which
will be featured by the Kansas re-
lays at the University of Kansas
stadium, will find the Irish track-
sters preparing for the Drake clas-
sic of the Saturday, following, in-
stead of following the original
plans which called for entry into
the Kansas games. The Drake out-
door classic, “The Olympic of the
West” will be the first big track
gathering of' the season and the
best blood of the country will be
in attendance.
Due to the unsettled condition of
the weather and to the fact that the
candidates for the team have had
very little time in which to show
their best wares, Coach George Keo-
gan announced that the baseball
game scheduled with Northwestern
at Evanston for next Monday was
cancelled.
The changing climatic conditions
have served to keep the squad in-
doors for the past two weeks after
the first promise of spring had in-
vited the diamond hopes out for a
few days’ work. During the few
days that they were outside, the
outfielders had only been given a
taste of practice and the batters
had little opportunity to get their
batting eye.	x
. The Interhall Athletic board has
finished plans for the interhairbace-
ball season and the schedule of nine
sections which was drawn up at the
meeting yesterday noon will be pub-
lished in the next issue. The base-
ball schedule calls for the opening
game next Sunday.
The prospects for a whirlwind
season are better this year than
ever before. The diamond sport is
being heralded with great popular-
ity in every hall and last week, with
the first signs of spring, aspirants
for the hall teams were out limber-
ing up. From twenty to thirty men
have been reporting in each hall to
the summons that was issued last
Sunday.

sity will be completely repaired and
two new indoor ones will be built,
it was announced yesterday by the
Rev. J. Hugh O’Donnell, C. S. C.
The work will be started as soon as
the weather conditions are suitable.
The outdoor courts will be re-
paired from the very bottom with a
new bed of clay and there will be
new uprights and new back walls.
The indoor courts will be in the
gymnasium. Though there have
been some there for the past 20
years, they will now be made perma-
nent and will be for practice when
outdoor tennis is not allowable
because of the weather:.
This will be a great aid to the
tennis team and it will assure them
of a place to practice and of fine
courts for the reception of the vis-
iting teams.
Efforts are being made by the
Tennis association to arrange
matches with the University of De-
troit for May 8, and with Illinois
university for May 12, both matches
to be played on the local courts.
The courts of Leeper park in
South Bend will be used by the
players as soon as weather condi-
tions permit outdoor work. At
present the team is practicing reg-
ularly in the Carroll hall gymnas-
ium.
