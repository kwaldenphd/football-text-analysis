ing and emphasizing the value : of

DISTINCTIVE
CONCERT HERE
Critic Praises Manuel and William-:
son in Program at Washing- :
ton Hall Last Night,
Philip Manuel and Gavin William-
son, two talented young artists,
played to a fairly large audience in
Washington hall last night. .
: .Manuel, a lyric tenor, possesses
a sweet, well modulated voice, and
his accompanist, Williamson,, dis-
played in his two<brief numbers at
the piano, an excellent technique
and rapid execution. ,
. The program as a whole was col-
orful, but not well balanced for a
Notre Dame;concert. Manuel is an
artist of the ultra-modern- school
and so attempted several song
vignettes;, as different has they were
delightful.;: .His< rendering of Mo-
zart’s “This Picture is Bewitching
Fair”'and Rachmaninoff’s “Songs
of Grusia” displayed the quality of
his lyric voice; / f; f ,. ' . .
:. “The ' Mice / and the Clock,”, by
Lagoiirage, proved to be' a very dif-
ferent number handled in:a clever
manner. What the program lacked
in, American semi-popular, selections
it ‘fully made up in -the Jnovelty of
theme and idea; :	•	7
Notre Dame has heard, at ‘ least,
a distinctive consert.

idea:
! “DO YOU KNOW HOW THE

only taken calculus and . can’t say?’
LL. B., ’24.—“Every night I fig-
ure out' my possibilities before set-
ting my alarm.”
Ph. B., ’26.—-“T don’t' care, I’ll
flunk anyway.” ‘. ■ '
A. ‘,’B., ’27.—“Is that another
joke .they’re springing on us?”

THEY WALKED THEIR MILE.
Dear' Looking' Glass:.
:In. studying up on Monasticism,
I believe I ran across the first men-
tion of Egyptian cigarettes. Speak-
irig .of the Fourth Century ascetics
of that country, the Rt. Rev. Don
Butler, .'said, “arid they kept ‘ cam-
els.”. . Maybe this- was to’ give the
monks their exercise.'
QUESTION
In. an effort to. raise the standard of student organizations the
S. A. C. lias demanded that each club shall give some evidence of high
standards and definite aspirations; if it cannot do so, it will be denied
the privilege of existing at Notre Dame. As to whether or not there
are too many clubs, the S. A. C. may be accepted, as a competent judge.
In the. period of uncertainty which followed jhe ultimatum of this
.body, however, some officers may have found it difficult to set forth a
justification for the continued existence of their particular group. Yet,
- because of sentiment,- or other indefinite reasons,' they may abhor the
thought of the club’s death. ■
If there be any such officers, it is possible that they will find
consolation iii the statement that, im spite of the numerous societies
at Notre Dame,' there is one feature which seems not to-have been the
concern of ambitious club organizers. That feature is ; the matter of
parliamentary law.	.'./■■	"	:	?
As suggested in a recent editorial, student interest, and conse-
quently the success of organizations, has declined because the members
have felt that too much time was consumed arid trio little - accomplished
in the meetings. This opinion, is undoubtedly correct; but one1 of; the
reasons'that so little is accomplished is the fact that so fewstudents
seem to have a working knowledge of the proper conduct in a meeting.
. Even the officers at times delay, the. transaction of business, by.
insistirig on secqnds-for. nominations which do- riot need a second, By
allowing motions to be made out’of order, and by permitting iindebat-
able questions : to be discussed. A; meeting , conducted .in a parliamentaxyl
mariner is unusually short arid to the point; a meeting not so,conducted
becomes long and uninteresting. 1 . •	? .	. '	,
Incidentally a reasonable, familiarity, with : the proper procedure
in meetings ?will be expected of those who attempt to: exert any ; influ-
ence in the business and social world of today.' It would seem, there-
fore, that any campus organization which firids itself in danger: of
'summary execution might secure. a stay; of execution by interesting
itself in the important, but seemingly friendless; parlia-meritary ’ law.
For, through its members who also take'a part; in the riaeetings . of
other groups, such an organization should indirectly benefit every club.
It is moved, therefore, that some - organization interest itself in
the investigation of the science—for it is a science—of parliamentary
procedure. ■ ■	;	.
Is there a'second?
CONRAD AND HECHTIC A UTHORS
A number of educators in America advocate having, the works of
Joseph : Conrad used-in the schools in much the same manner as are
the works of Milton, Shakespeare, Scott; and Dickens... If we had
any authority, which; as Mr? Dooley . used'to say, “We have not,” ;we
would .revise the English curriculum arid require .the study , of Elinor
Glyn, F.. Scott Fitzgerald, Ben Hecht, Dorothy Speare, and Stephen
Vincent-Benet. The fact is that librarians declare the works of the
- standard authors are covered with dust while contemporary drivel is
in constant demand. , This, the librarians explain, is -because once a
- boy of girl has been obliged to study a book in school, he has little or

(From Baltimore Evening/Sun.) /
NEW YORK, Oct. 15:—Many of
the Eastern' football ’teams could
profitably, sit at the feet of. Knute
Rockne’s light Notre Dame eleven
when. it. comes to . pushing, touch-
downs across; :	:
While some of the big-timers, of
the East were, struggling Saturday.
. with the problem of scoring; after
they had got into the enemy’s dan-
, ger zone, the. Notre Dame team,
lined up against a. powerful Army
eleven, .was /showing. just" how - it
, can be done. Twice near the Army’s
goal, Notre Dame uncorked abso-
lutely insoluble r plays and pushed
the ball, across. She traveled 21
yards on two,running, plays- for the
second score of; her 13-0 victory. ;.
/ Meanwhile, Yale .added ; a . bit to
her .prestige by her,. victory, over
University . of: Georgia.:<• Richeson
proved that he was no .flash; in the
pan,, but a real quarter, and Mile-
stead, although'not yet in top -form,
showed, himself; a powerful and- ac-
tive player..,;, But Yale is : one: of
those who might .take a - lesson? or
two from /.Rockne’s f men. She
lacked scoring, deception < within the

. By; ARTHUR ROBINSON
.Notre Daine had four .Casey Sten- ■
gels. at Ebbets field yesterday af-
ternoon, and they all looked a little
like Babe Ruth., And on'the side-
lines, tense1 and fidgety, sat Knute
Rockne, a species of football “mas-
ter mind,” master-minding with ex-
quisite intelligence and victorious
effect.- •	r?:.- ■ •
The game between Notre : Dame
and the Army was, in a way, a con-
test between “brute force,”, repre-
sented ; by the Army,; and fine foot-
ball philosophy and ■ thought; repre-
sented by Rorikne^
Notre Dariie . didn’t need ali of
her Stengels. One ..would have been
enough and it might, have been
either Elmer. Layden, Jim- Crowley,
Harry Stuhldreher or,Don Miller.

were ;much too .much for the Army.

There is something of a magician
about this man Rockne;, something

Rockne’s Fighting Team will
leave for the East .this morning
. where they will meet the Princeton
grid warriors in the Tiger camp
next Saturday afternoon!	7
The attention, of • the football
1 world is centered on .the eastern
battle ground, and while debating
the outcome of the big game, they
marvel at the ability and courage
of the football coach who .would
take on two such formidable teams
asz the Army and Princeton within ;
eight days.	'	'	.
' With only two days of real prac-
tice:on Cartier field, Rockne-will .
go today to encounter one of the
finest coached teams in that' section
of the - country/' Coach Roper’s :
gridiron meh passed1 through, an" im-
beaten season last year, and hopes'
are running high of repeating their ;
feat of last year. The Tigers are
.’ rushing preparations in order that
they might be able to meet the
Rdckmen in Palmer stadium, with
a passing game that will meet its 1
test against the strategy of ’ the
originator, Rockne.
Roper is another exponent of the
“game from the neck up’’ and, will
present a team next Saturday that ;
will be confident of matching wits
. with the Irish on an equal basis. -
; In the passing game that is grad-
■ ually being accepted in the East,
\ the Tigers have an assortment of
.... . aerial . plays .that-. include long,
short and triple passes. Further-
more, the kicking end .of the game
/ is well taken care of by LeGrendre,
with Snively, captain of the eleven,
doing, the pass work in backfield.
Snively’s deadly passing is empha-
sized by. the complexities of the
plays with which th? .Tigers hope to
sustain the reputation in the East
this year. . ,	.	-
Critics, viewing last Saturday’s
game with Georgetown, -remarked
on the weakness of the .Princeton
. line as well as their'defense against
the passing attack. Rockne will
have an aerial game Saturday that
should Laffie the Tigers, as the lesser
bags of : tricks baffled . t^
The terrific speed .with which the
Irish execute their backfield game
is one of the reasons-it-is so suc-
■ ■. cessful. ■ y '	.-7
The last practice session of the
Irish was conducted in the gym last
... night as the inclement weather pro-
. hibitecK outdoor 7work.	Although
the time at the disposal of the Rock-
men to work on Princeton forma-
tions was' limited, the defense' is
working smoothly. The team that
made the Army trip were out in
uniform and are primed for the
Tiger battle Saturday, with’ a fight-
.ing ,2est equal to that which
. manifested itself last week.
: A post-season game/ with some
. team on the Pacific coast has been
discussed, "but Rockne character-
1 ized all stories to th'at effect as
“stories.” z	.
The'’Irish. football men are now
under the care of Verly Smith,, who
. gained a nation-wide reputation as
a trainer during, the three years that

Fire Breaks Out
Ori Cartier Field
Fire of unknown origin destroyed
a section of the fence on the east
side of Cartier field yesterday,
shortly before 2 o’clock. A high
wind from 'the south swept the
flames ’ along the fence' for about
35 feet before’ the flip was con-
trolled by firemen..
The blaze was discovered at 1:30,
and an alarm sent , in to the South
Bend fire department. On the ar-
rival of the fire trucks, a hose was
strung from the hydrant in front
of Sophomore hall to the scene of
the fire. Students aided the fire-
men. The. fire was under control
