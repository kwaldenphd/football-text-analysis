contest, Mr. Grundy wishes to take
this opportunity to expresse pub-
licly his thanks to .Messrs. Rohrbach
and Fusz for their interest. It was
these gentlemen—lad-iees and - gen-
tle-men, who made the welkin- and
the anvil ring for hours and hours
while .they hammered out the mas-
sive souvenir. The callouses which
now adorn the hands of these two
worthy engineers were received in
this labor of gratitude — and the
DAILY and Mr. Grundy both join
in expressing their most salubrious
(good adjective?) felicitations . to
these future alumni. A record is
being kept of all men who assist
Mr. Grundy in life which may re-
sult in untold good fortune for the
lucky man. Rohrbach and Fusz
have red-ink notations after their
names.	- „• •	•

■We: mentioned above that we
have found most of our new class-

philosophy class, J and did not dis-
cover his error .for several days

Day, Sorin, Cadillac, and Badin
Next in Order; All Contests
■ Sunday Were Close.
Five of the most hotly contested
cage battles that have been fought
this season were played among the
various halls in the gym Sunday.
The games were unusually close
and the outcomes were in doubt un-
til the final whistle., The teams
showed an improvement in every
department of the game, especially
in handling the ball and taking it
through the opposition. The larg-
est crowd that has so far witnessed
|he contests was present Sunday.
; The feature contest on the bill
Sunday was the battle between Car-
rol! and Sophomore, . Carroll win-
riing by the count of 29 to 27.
I The Sorin-Day contest ranked a
close second to the Carroll-Soph
game in excitement. Fighting for
second place the two teams battled
on even terms, first one and then
the other being ahead, until the
finish, when the off-campus team
was victorious, 19 to • 17.
i Brownson came up a notch in the
interhall standing when- it defeated
Walsh .18 to J.5. ; Both teams played
brilliantly and erratic at times, al-
though both had good team work.
The Cadillac ring artists, show-
ing the same style of attack that
figured in their victory last week,
emerged victors over the Corby
tossers, 20 to 9.
The Badin ringers strengthened
their standing when they handed a
16 to 13 defeat to Freshman.

IRISH LOOPMEN
One Point Margin Gives Indiana
Game; Contest One of Best
This Season.
The Notre Dame basketball quin-
tet once more played a. one-point
margin game Tuesday night, and
this time with Indiana, but was left
on the lower side, of a 21-20 score
after staging one of the scrappiest
comebacks in the second half that
has been seen on the Bloomington
floor.
The. first frame saw the state
school courtmen: carry on hostilities
with a dazzling speed and they held
a nice lead at the half. Near the
end of the period Logan, the star
who is now filling the shoes of the
brilliant Nyikos, sustained an in-
jury that kept him off the floor un-
til near the end of the game.
Notre Dame stepped into the bat-
tle with* 1 2 3 4 * added zest in the second
period and began to increase the
points on the Irish side of the score
board. With the victory once so
securely in their grasp but now
within a few moments of being
swept away by the new attack by
the tossers from the Bend,. Les

HELD SATURDAY
Wayne Cox, Half-Miler, Wins at
Kansas City for N, 0.; Others
Fail to Place.
The Irish tracksters will take on
a little conditioning workout pre-
paratory to the Illinois meet when
they gather for the annual Blue and
Gold meet which’ will be run off in
the local gym at 3 o’clock Satur-
day. The program of events will
also contain several novice runs.
The work of the Frosh in this meet
will also determine the personnel
of the yearling squad which will go
to Culver in a dual meet Februr
ary 23.
Wayne Cox, Rockne’s brilliant
little half-miler, who is a sure
point winner in nearly every
meet, was the only member of the
Irish squad that appeared, in action
in the Kansas City invitation meet
last Saturday night to score a win
for the Irish tracksters. Cox broke
the tape in the 880-yard run in
2:00 2-5, after having stepped away
from the smartest talent in the
Missouri Valley. :
: Both the mile and two mile re-
lay teams failed to land a place in
the meet, although; Captain .Ken-
nedy, it is reported,’ turned in his
half mile in 1:59. Both the time of-
Cox and Kennedy is remarkably
fast for an indoor track. Barr and
Layden, both encountered a little
hard luck at the start of the sprint
arid were unable to place.
GLEE CLUB SCORES I
I
; To say that the Glee club con-
cert given in Washington hall last
night was a success is restraining
praise to the freezing point. Not
only was it a success, but it de-
veloped into a .triumph; a triumph
for Dr.- J. Lewis-Browne, to whom
the splendid performance of the
club is primarily due, • for Senorita
Milia Ybarra, Dr. .Browne’s pupil,
whose numbers marked the high
lights of the evening, and a triumph
for .Joseph J. Casasanta, whose
“Hike, Notre Dame” was sung for
the first time.
; Senorita Ybarraj the assisting
artist, possesses one of the finest so-
prano voices. that has been heard
in Washington hall for some time
past; she has an excellent stage
presence, and her technique7 is such
that it is easy to predict her con-
tinued success.
: The. Glee club as a whole showed
the effects of careful training; the
performance was a credit to the
club and to the; director. The ren-
dition of 7 “Drink to Me Only With
Thine Eyes,” in which: Vernon
Rickard and George Koch took the
solo parts,* was exceptionally good.
.“Hike, Notre Dame,” the closing
number on the program, scored the
popular success of the evening,
■with Mr. Casasanta, the composer,
directing. ; • -

rose e’er blooming” (Paraetdrius-

of the Breen Medal and winner of
the state oratorical contest, was
elected Grand Knight of Notre
Dame Council, Knights of Colum-
bus to succeed the retiring Grand
Knight, Henry F. Barnhart, at the,
regular meeting of the organization
Tuesday night His election created
a vacancy in the office of Advocate,
and John Stanton was unanimously
elected to that position.
Father Patrick Haggerty, was the
principal speaker of the evening.
He was introduced by Harry A. Mc-
Guire, and in the absence of Coach
Knute k. Rockne, who was detained
by illness, delivered a brief im-
promptutalk on “Character” which
he spiced with several humorous -
stories. His talk was one of the-,
most interesting delivered in the . .
local council chamber and it was
well received by the one hundred
and seventy-five Knights in at-
tendance.
Mr. Nolan performed his first of-
ficial act as Grand Knight yesterday
when he appointed Robert Curry,
Lecturer of the Council, to succeed
Harry A. McGuire, who like Mr.
Barnhart, found it necessary to re-
sign his office ori account of other
important duties. -
Mr. Barnhart in retiring thanked
his co-workers "arid fellow knights
for their cooperation during his in-
cumbency and stated that he'would
continue to devote as much time as
possible:to the interest of the coun-
cil. . Members ..of the council rose
arid showed their approbation. for:
the splendid work of Mr. Barnhart

ST. .VALENTINE’S DA Y
The spirit of St. Valentine’s Day is one of friendship; a spirit
which-unfortunately may have become dominated by sentimentality,
but a spirit which is most commendable in itself. The saint after.whom
the day is named was indeed-a true~friend, one who laid down his life
for others; for it was the assistance which this holy priest-gave to the
martyrs in the presecution under Claudius II in the third century that
brought about his own martyrdom.
St. Valentine’s Day is, therefore, a time most appropriate for the
ever-absorbing discussion of friendship. With all that has been written
on this theme the subject runs little risk of exhaustion because human
beings will always realize that no one lives to himself alone.
. Everyone desires friends; and all who desire them may have them.
But all too frequently friendships are formed without a true apprecia-
. tion of the meaning of the word.
•	• It is indeed a poor notion of friendship that makes it consist of
mere reciprocal amusement, the idle frivolity of those without serious
purpose, who gather to kill time: and to drown dull care. Such friend-
ship ceases when the excitement ceases.
A friendship acquired at the expense of character, at the sur-
render of our finer impulses to influences that pull us down, is unde-
sirable.
A. real friendship implies the acceptance of a trust and involves a
responsibility. It cannot live without a .swift interchange of human,
interests, great or small. It subjects on the minutiae of everyday
existence as well as on the great exalted moods.
Friends are to help one another. And only when a friend has
done his best by one who expected nothing less, has he kept the faith,
as he was bound to keep it when he accepted that trust of friendship.
BACK AND AT ’EM
■ After a suspension of one day while the University officials were
reviewing its financial condition, the Daily is back into the ring and
fighting like fury for its continued existence.
The Daily got a bad start financially. But by continuing the up-
hill fight that it has waged all year, it is probable that it can pull out
of the hole.
-You have already given us your cooperation, and you have made
sacrifices in order to do it. We ask only that your backing be as strong
in the future as it has been in the past. And when our faults creep out,
as they are bound to do, come and tell us_about them; even if we can’t
. remedy them, we can at least try.
Terry is Afflicted
with “Heebie Jeebies”
“Terry,” our world-famed mas-
cot, is suffering with what is . be-
lieved to be the first case of . .“hee-
bie jeebies” ever recorded in ;dog
history.	■
The mascot’s condition is very
serious, but unless a marked im-
provement is shown Notre ; Dame
will be minus Terry when the foot-
ball season arrives.
Several of the most; noted spe-
cialists of this disease are in at-
tendance. The master of the ken-
nel left last night for Tia Juana to
confer with. Barney Google, the
owner of the .famous, race horse,
Spark Plug. Mr.?Googlehas:offered
his services and promised to do all
in his power to relieve Terry of . his
suffering!. “Sunshine”, also has of-
fered his. aid.. It is believed that
the dark youth knows, more' about
the “heebies” than, any other hu-
man. .... .... .....
This. strange malady.. which. has
overtaken the pup, is hard .to ex-
plain. The disease has affected but
one other in its. short history, the
unfortunate being. Spark Plug. Last
night the writer saw Terry and the
brute lacked the usual friskiness
and the merry twinkle in his eyes
was missing. Terry’s ribs could
easily be counted; his / coat was
shaggy; his hair thin; his head and
neck were covered with the strange
and • somewhat peculiar “heebie
jeebie” rash. The pup looked
down and out!

THE TURNOVER
We read quite recently that “reg-
ulation is perhaps the greatest prob-
lem of life.” In substance this is
somewhat of a parody on the Ten
Commandments. ; It is the science
of moral philosophy in a nut-shell.
Hence we are inclined to amend the
statement by deleting the qualifi-
cation “perhaps,” and to read sim-
ply “regulation is the greatest prob-
lem of life.”
Regulation means acting accord-
ing, to rule. : And since a rule of
action is what is meant by a law,
the above statement may be writ-
ten thus: Legislation is life’s great-
est problem. It is, of course, not
an easy problem. Social life is
complex, and growing more and
more so as it becomes more civil-
ized, and therefore, presumably,
more perfect. In primitive society
men literally “made” their own liv-
ing. In modern society they mere-
ly earn money with which to pur-
chase a living. What they live by
is not the product of one or a few
individuals, but of a very large
number of them cooperating to-
gether. Increasing complexity of
THE INK WELL'
By DENNIS O’NEILL
Washington’s Southern Tour, ‘ Archibald
Henderson; Houghton, Miffiin and Co.
Special' Limited Edition of 1,000 copies.
A great deal of criticism has been
directed against the biographers of
Washington, who hurry over or dis-
regard altogether' his journey
through the southern states in
179L The importance attached to
•the trip by Washington himself is
clearly shown by the amount of
data he left concerning it. Not-
withstanding this fact two of his
best known biographers, Woodrow
Wilson and Henry Cabot . Lodge,
have not even mentioned k his ex-
periences or impressions of this
most inter esting section^ of the coun-
try in post-revolutionary. days.
As an example of the interesting-
ly. human incidents that befall
Washington in this land, of hospital-
ity the following is cited:
“As Washington and his caval-
cade neared the home of Richard
Brandon, Esq.—at what is known
as the old “Stockton Place,” about
six miles southwest of Salisbury^—
he bade the cavalcade stop and rode,
forward alone to the door of' the
farm house. Somewhat fatigued,
from his early start and the exer-
tions of the journey—for Washing-
ton was about sixty—and anticipat-
ing the ordeal of a long public re-
ception at Salisbury, Washington
determined upon a little rest and
refreshment. At the. door,, in an-
swer to his knock, appeared a rosy-
cheeked, bright-eyed Betsy Bran-
don of some twelve summers. In
reply to the stranger’s inquiry. if
he might have a cup of coffee and
some... light refreshment, she an-
swered that there was no one at
home.	, •.
< “I am all alone,” explained little
Betsy, plaintively, “everybody has
gone to see General Washington
but me. And Oh! I do so wish I
could see him!” • • .
“Well,” replied the benign-look-
ing stranger, who quickly won lit-
tle Betsy’s confidence, “I think we
can arrange that. Let’s make a bar-
gain., If you make me a cup-of
coffee,: I’ll promise you a sight of
General Washington.” V
The bargain was . immediately
closed, the cup of coffee quickly
prepared by the excited Betsy, and
even more quickly, drunk by the
tired traveler. '
“Now,” demanded Betsy, eager
in her expectation and all-unsus-
pecting curiosity, “you must keep
your promise, and show me General
Washington.” -
Imagine her astonishment, not
unmixed . with. dismay, when this
mild-mannered stranger, . with ; a
grave.and genial smile, replied: •
“General Washington is .now be-
fore you.”
Such ..incidents are . not uncom-
mon in the lives of. great men—if
we are;to .belieye their biographers
:—-but these little stories, of Wash-
ington have; the additional charm
of a romatic background- .that
gives them a new interest and a dif-
ferent aspect.
cooperation has resulted in increas-
ed interdependence of individuals,
and hence of social life.
Metaphysical minds will doubt-
less discover grounds for a paradox
in this. For according to accepted
standards of perfection, complexity
or composition is regularly looked
upon: as a sign of imperfection,
while, conversely,.simple beings1 are
placed higher in the . scale. And on
this score there appears to be some
misgiving about the genuineness of
social progress, for there is much
complaint against and effort to
eliminate the increasing complexi-
ties of social life. One observer is
frankly of the opinion that in the
matter of complexity civilization
has reached, a “saturation point.”
Now it may be observed that in-
telligent regulation is the greatest
safeguard against complexity. For
regulation is the only known and
effective antidote .for a jam. Mu-
nicipal authorities have : instituted
the traffic cop in order to obviate
the traffic jam.' A jam halts the
march of events. It causes loss of
time, of property and of temper. It
is disorder in the concrete. It is
complexity. on wheels. Regulation
keeps the road open, the wheels in
motion. It preserves peace, pro-
motes prosperity, increases happi-
ness, extends life.
The street is an emblem of the
mind, a figure of life. It is true
that ideas do not run on wheels (in
spite of the popular jibe), but thej
must nevertheless proceed along
definite lines. If there is no regu-
lation, no mental traffic cop, they
are bound to get in one another’s
way, bound to get into a jam. In
the paths of the mind,, as well as on
highways paved. with bricks, there
are, so to say, besides "dignified ve-
hicles, a swarm of Fords which,
though of comparatively little im-
portance and worth, tend to block
traffic, if for no other reason...than
that they: occupy space. ;It is prob-

THE NINETY-FOUR
Someone, probably .an insurance
agent, was quoted recently as saying,
that from the mass of one hundred
college graduates one individual, only
rose to the Polo and butler class, peril-
ously near the top of the financial lad-
der. Five others became comfortably
off and found themselves after twenty
years at the small yacht and chauffeur
stage. The other ninety-four presum-
ably congregate in the great section of
the American people who drive their
own Buicks to the golf club. In other
words,- dreaming about being a rich
man is one thing, and making the grade
is “something blse again.”
Yet the ninety-four presumably work
just as hard as the sumptuous six. Their
business is the axis on which a small
and uninteresting world revolves. They
have become devotees of the ..dollar
and when that fickle deity deserts, have
nowhere .else to turn. Jammed in a
dull, straight rut of business they can
never leave the road and jump the fence
into finer fields of life. This, then, is
the portion, of ninety-four, men out of
every hundred now on the campus.
The answer to the problem lies in
the proper choice of a career.

able that perfect regulation of men-
tal Fords would render traffic cops
in the proper sense unnecessary.
’ For ideas get out into the street.
They emerge through the doors of
action. Regulation of human ac-
tions is properly speaking legisla-
tion.. A man is, socially and mor-
ally, what his actions make him to
be. He may be regulated from with-
in. He could not be regulated from
without-were he not also regulated
from within. He is in a sense his
own legislator. He is a man, he
succeeds in his affairs, he is es--
teemed by his fellows, he fulfills
his life’s purpose according as he
succeeds in that. • It is “the great-
est.problem”.of his life,_because it~
is nothing less; than rational living.

Ford fill the principal roles, and are
supported by a large and very good
cast, including the “twelve most

resenting the chorus of a musical

siderably, and incidentally play the

The plot is wearisome at times,
and Miss Shannon is guilty of giv-
ing us a feeling of profound de-
pression by her frequent weeping
spells. Ford’s portrayals are con-
sistently excellent, as usual. ■
The first part of the story goes
badly for the principals, due to the
fact that a gold mine was discov-

complications fail to untangle, un-

Comparisons are odorous, I
know; but if the scent from the'
comparison wafts the perfume of
justice, the comparison should be
made.
I have just come to Notre Dame
after having spent a year and a
half at a much larger university.
I am not sure whether the Tetter
concerning the library, which ap-
peared recently in this column, was
a form of goofing or whether the
writers was in earnest. No matter;
I shall take him seriously and run
chances of having the double “O”
in “goof” hung on me.
Having been trained to use the
library as my most helpful tool in
getting an education, about the first
place I got to know on the campus
was Lemonnier. I do. not .expect
to find the latest fiction in a uni-
versity library; and in addition, I
am not in a position to judge all
phases of library service at Notre
Dame. - But this I do know. I have
never met better cooperation or
more courteous service than I have
found at the reference and circu-
lation desks in Lemonnier. I mar-
vel how the reference librarian
keeps it up. I sat watching the de-

Manns, the Indiana mentor, sent
Logan into the game to add a few
points to pull the game out of the
fire. Logan came up to expecta-
tions and the Keogan loopers were
forced to swallow a dose of defeat
which for a moment looked like a
troumph.
Kizer and Crowe were the high
lights of the’Irish aggregation and
played a huge part in the second
period comeback despite the des-
perate defense of Indiana netmen.
Notre Dame takes on another
heavy tesk when they stack up
against the Wabash five tonight,
which won a 27-22 victory over the
Maylmen here last week.

Relay Record
The third series of the interhall
relays were run off Tuesday in the
gym where the record of 1:37 3-5,
made by Sophomore last-week, was
lowered to 1:37 flat by the Carroll
sextet when it • defeated Corby.
Sophomore, who did not have to
run because of the absence of So-
rin, attempted to shatter this new
mark in a race against time, but
failed.
Badin forfeited to Cadillac,
Freshman trounced Brownson, and
Walsh beat the Day-Dogs in the
other races. As the league stands
now, Carroll, Freshman and Sopho-
more are tied for the leadership.
Following are the results of
Tuesday’s races:
Carroll beat Corby, time, 1:37;
Walsh beat Day-Dogs, time 1:39 1-
5; Freshman beat Brownson, time,
1:37, 1-5; Badin forfeited to Cad-
illac; Sorin forfeited to Sophomore.
