Laiincelot, or Lawrence,, it was, was
excited. ’ He reached for the door

possessor of a whole door. He had
Tarzaned it away from \ its hinged

again, leaving in its wake, not' the havoc of a defeat but rather a great
swath of friendliness. From the; yellow jerseys they wore to the
/duskypacer who carried-their water,' the; meh from Atlanta, were color-
ful and interesting, and what is much more, sportsmen and gentlemen.
• There is much to be admired in a fighting team which will battle
• to .the end against.sure defeat/ and theri^accept that defeat in ;a spirit
■of ,cordial sportsmanship. Everyone likes a'battler no'ihatter in what
game. he.plays and.everyone likes..and respects a good loser. Most any
team .can show ,a dashing, fighting, spirit’; it requires trie gentlern’an .to
- smile.away ,the .frown of defeat. /Trie game last Saturday was hard-
fought and cleanly played. . The tackling 'and interference were fast
and hard;but,the whistle ■ always ended the play with a' noticeable ab-
sence;, of .roughing. Moreover, the: last quarter , did not .reveal a de-
.Seated team vainly attempting1 to injure /where it could; not defeat. . .
If is hoped Nbtre^Dame’s relations-with;Georgia Tech Shave just
begun. • The men.;from Atlanta have, accepted two defeats:but both
games have been fast'arid interesting and-played in an exceptionally
clean and sportsmanlike way. Perhaps-the next meeting will result
in a victory: for the Golden Tornado and Notre: Dame men will 'have
the opportunity to show the'sportsmanship of the, loser. ’Be: that, how-
ever, for the future; for the present let us assure the men from/Dixie

; He: -was : the magician that could' paint ithe past :in rich, vermillion
tints; . His voice was the; elixir that: could touch • careworn age 'with

His soul (was the window of ;Sweetness':and light. - :	" •

wealth, or. the intoxicating/taste of honors and greatness. He lived
in the bosom of mercy, and’.many a man has “Flo’s” memory to thank

Berry, tall and solid. They throw
each other across the room, knock
down 'book cases, destroy chairs,
and fight with; every bit of power
they have.. The fight lasts a long
time and is said to be a better one
than the one fought by William
Farnum and Thomas Santzchi in
the old. version of the picture. I
didn’t see the other-fight, however,
and that, you know, is too bad. •
. The story.\is interesting. It is
well-suited to the screen. The blow-
ing up of the 'claim furnishes the
director with an . opportunity he
could not neglect. Then there is a
niob scene, too. •
Stars are many. Almost a dozen
of the more noted screen actors and

a chance. I spied him acting as a
mere butler for a mere few min-

; What They Say
[Newark Ledger]
Knute K. Rockne, Notre Dame’s
greatest of *the great, paid a visit to
St.’ Benedict’s Preparatory School
of Newark the day before the
Princeton game, and spoke before
the students assembled in Shanley
gym.
. The Notre Dame /teacher stressed
the fact that the qualities that make
for success in the game of football
are also the qualities that make for
success in the game of life. Football
rightly played, builds character, he
said.' - -
. “Football today,” said Rockne,
“is played from the shoulders up.
This was, not alw'ays the. case.
THE
OLIVER
ALL WEEK
Years ago college teams; were -got-
ten together on the basis of ton-
nage. Candidates presented them-
selves and were ordered to weigh
in. The eleven heaviest got jobs
on the first, team. Weight was
deemed the supreme important as-
set. College coaches do, things dif-
ferently in these days. ’ Today foot?
ball has evolved into a game in
which, brains, mental alertness,. abil-
ity to decide quickly and to. act
quickly, resourcefulness, .-.martial
strategy, patience, and: courage, all
mental and moral qualities, are at
a premium. If we should,be victor-
ious in our hard game, tomorrow, it
will be because the/Notre' Dame
players summon these qualities and
employ them well, , .
’ “Football is a great game,” con-
tinued the N. D. grid-master, “be-
cause, perhaps better than, any oth-
er game, it expresses the spirit of
an institution to the world at large.
That is one reason? why :• the; team
representing a school or college
should receive the 'hearty/ support
and encouragement of every student
at that institution.” • ,. . .
/ ■ -• • /
[The Indianapolis, Star] ;	;
The impressive victory over Geor-
gia Tech, although it-was expected',
completed one, of the greatest tasks
ever accomplished • by’, a college
eleven and to Coach' Rockne, the
“master mind’’ of the . Notre , Dame
eleven, goes the bulk of the credit.
Never before has ” a ’team'•-won
three big sectional games on three
consecutive ' Saturdays . arid . all of
them; by such decisive margins. ’.
• Coach Alexander of Georgia
Tech eleven said after .the game;:
“The Notre Dame team .is , the best
team I have ever seen,” and Dick
Jemison, who as sports editor of the
Atlanta Constitution from 1907 to
1919, reported every game' played
by the Golden Tornado said: > “Not
only is the Notre Dame backfield the
fastest and smoothest working thing
I have seen nr action, but’ the line
makes up for any lack of weight by
fast, intelligent charging and a diag7
nosis of the play that shows good
training.”
By PERCY HAUGHTON :	U
’• [The Indianapolis Star]'.;/ 'I /
First,’ the .University of _Notre
Dame has - a distinct-athletic atmos-
phere surrounding it... .Everyone
plays games in the afternoon in-
stead of loafing or “going to town.”
Football is rampant not only in the
autumn but all through the spring.,.
Rockne livesthere and is ,d6n-.
stantly feeding -his subject to ;the‘

boys. The athlete holds the center
of the stage, and although the en-
rollment:- is: only some 1,800, 'the
whole college is football .crazy.
Naturally such'.: an’- environment
draws - good -athletes. . Moreover,
Rockne1’trains his freshmen and var-
sity teamsi along'identical lines, so
that his varsity is- constantly, fed
with meri of one year’s experience
in his' methods.-’ On top of this it
so happens that eight of his present
teams are in' the junior class, so
that they : have had two and a half
years of Rockne’s teachings;
All'of ‘which. means rhat he' was
quite naturally able: to. develop this
year’s team .to aii extraordinary de-
gree of. excellence at a time, when
other coaches' were -.just emerging
from a period' of fundamentals^ ' ’
Again, let me reiterate' that /this-
is in nd'wise a Criticism bf Rockne.
He has simply 'got'the jump on the
I other/ fellow, not only in the excel-
lence of his Material’ and in the
advanced stagb bf his present’team,
[but in a great many of his methods,
He has'grown up in the game-, hav-
ing been a player and later assistant
coach. Of- Notre' 'Dame ‘before’ his
present incumbency' as ’ head ' coach.
He is a close Student’ of- the 'game,
and, although possessed of great
imagination, he calls his information
frdm the best’football'brains in the
country.' ' 1 Hence' his' System con-
tains all the good points/in modern
football.1' As' he' aptly'said to me
after a long talk-when last in' New

eleven men to work- so perfectly as
did Rockne’s men.
There’s-not a semblance of alibi
in the Tigers’ camp. Although
Princeton has been practicing for
a shorter period ,thah has Notre
Dame, there is no denying that few
Princeton elevens, even at the close
of . the season in. the battle with
Yale, have ben drilled to the degree
of football perfection that Notre
Dame showed in Palmer stadium.
That the coordination of men is
due. to the coach is certain, and
Rockne has developed this coordi-
nation in his men to a science, aye,
almost to an art. To ’see every
Notre Dame man who carried the
ball supported by five interferers
was more than unique to local.fol-
loweres of the gridiron game. Even
when;- the / Princeton tackles were
not boxed- and . the /- runner, was
stopped, Notre Dame had gone for-
ward from three to five yards.
It- is. still a further opinion of
Princetonians’ that Jim Crowley,
the brilliant halfback, deserves an
undisputed place on any all-Amer-
ican team. The way he twisted and
dodged his way from tackler after
tackler was a reminder of Don
Lourie.

PURDUE FACES
ROCKMEN HEXT
Phelan’s Charges; Make Good
Showing in Big Ten; Irish Draw
Bids for Coast Games. ..
With the ..third' great intersec-
tional clash safely stowed away in
the anrials of football history, the
Rockmen are lookirig forward to the
Homecoming struggle against Pur-
due with: interest at.-102 degrees in
the . shade;' since Jimmy Phelan’s
proteges made such : a? wonderful
showing against the title-contend-
ing . Maro ons at.. Chicago.. . . , .
. Since, .the advent ofv Phelan, a
former: Notre Dame ;football star,
to. the coaching job at the Lafayette
school, ; the . Engineers’ ; football
teams; have been: given ^greater im-
petus than .has been experienced.,at
the. school on theyWabash -river. in
years. The dopirig of the .dopersters
' had it that the team of 1923 would
be a revelation of the prowess of
Phelan as la coach and would either
iriake or break Purdue in the Con-
ference running. Last year Phelan
had a likely looking bunch of fresh-
men from which to build up a team
that would be 'a serious menace to
' the Big Ten title aspirants this year.
i; Theshowing . of Purdue against
Iowa : and Chicago < this season has
gone far toward fulfilling, these pre-
’ dictions, and the Irish , will have no
easy job on their hands: when they
lirie up for,the kick-off next Satur-
day, before a record-breaking Home-
coming crowd: .	.. *
/Phelan.;- :has - shifted " Wellman,
brilliant full-back of last season’s
• aggregation, from the back field to
; the .end, where he has been showing
great form since the present sea-
son. opened. Wellman is a mighty
power on the defense as weir as the
offense, and was the only performer
in the Purdue rariks. last year who
could make any impression- in the
Irish line. As a ball toter, he was
a’terrific plunger, and as an end he
will?, be dangerous' because of
- his great speed and ability to break
up defense-formations.
. '	? Phelan has several veterans, in the
line, including Claypool, whose per-
fdrrnance at the pivot position since
he entered college football ranks
:	has been remarkable for its consis-
. tency? • '
71 Due to the sensational perform-
ance' of the Rockmen since . the. open-
ing of the season,: bids /are . flowing
into -the’. school , for x post-season
games on the coast, and tKey’are at
