Some of them are rather queer,
rather puerile/you might say. For
.instance, I am told that Joe Bailey,
of Sophomore hall, has purchased a
new'pair of shoes. - This is possibly
an event in the-hall.

Another tells me that Vinnie Mc-
Nally, sensational halfback on the
Carroll ’halt football squad, has re-,
ceived a.tasty shipment of delicious
pretzels. The sender of the salted
morsel did riot' give her name, and
,Mr. McNally is greatly puzzled; he
‘cannot sleep at night thinking who
’of. all the. beautiful young ladies he
knows is the admirer with such ex-
, trabrdinary. taste. He invites the
campus over to share the half bushel
of delicacies.

RECTOR. '
-O- -0-
I received a letter yesterday—a
very flattering letter. ’ The writer, a
Mr. Smith, president, of a company
in Warren, Pa., a company, that
makes what I am sure are unusual
wool coats, has deigned to flatter
me. Under, a Philadelphia post-
mark, he begins his letter thus:
' / “I am writing /to > you today be-
cause you are an Alumnus, of the
' /University of Notre Dame.”’J
// That is,, in 'itself/a? high compli-
ment, a rather anticipatory compli-
. ment’ (if I may be permitted to coin
the word.) ,But he continues by
■inferring that I-am a man. of taste.
/In this ,new coat .we have. corii-
bined all the■ essential qualities that
. a, well-dressed?man is. looking for.
? . •; V . It is a coat that appeals
to discriminating men.”' And what
js better yet, “all this at no extra
;.cost.”
Mr? Smith concludes by saying
;that he ' would like to! send me one
?of these” coats in1 my exact fit. at
this expense. I shall be permitted
?to wear it for a week-without cost
and then, because':!/ ana' “a Notre
Lanie Alumnus,” I may have it for
only $32.50.v All I need do, to make
a hit at the Georgia Tech game is
to fill but‘the blank putting, down
mymeasurements. ,	/
.Wonderfully kind of Mr. Smith.

today’s game, but, they manifest the
spirit of .the entire team in ;a few
words: ‘ “We’ll fight to the finish.” '
' Since both teams have played big
games and won, today’s1 game will
be a test of worth, the most impor-
tant battle that either team'has yet
engaged' in. > - ? ■ - ' ;	. *
, The Irish,’ having made a high
mark in the football world for'the
season of 1923 by their sensational
defeats, of two.great eastern teams,
'will.-.have more .than/a mere game

though /also triumphant in ' the

to gain in .today’s struggle, if the

Hooda was undergoing a quiz.
With fiendish and diabolical nasti-
ness, the professor was hammering
questions at him. . It looked bad for
Hooda, and'then some one came in
late and. sat in front of him. From
then things went differently for
some strange jreason.
Prof.—“What does the expres-
sion, ‘‘A; horse, a horse, my kingdom
for a horse,’ make you think of?”
“A dice game,” said Hooda.
Prof.—“What do, you think of
the epigram, ‘He travels fastest who
travels alone’?”
“The man that wrote that never
had someone chasing him,” gurgled
Hooda.
Prof.—“And concerning the line,
‘Now is the time for all good men
to—:
“Pardon, I haven’t a typewriter,”
whined Hooda.
Prof.—‘Have you ever been in a
dilemma?”-.

Hooda. •
Prof.—“You have displayed to
me a vigorous ignorance. ! I shall
attempt one more question. Light-
ning travels 24,638,925,450 miles a
second; Is there anything in: your
befuddled mind that travels faster?”
“Yes,” said our Hooda. “It is

WELCOME THE GOLDEN TORNADO
Southern hospitality is traditionak	.......
When the Notre Dame-football team visited Atlanta last year
thdy were given a welcome that they will never forget. Nothing:was
; too good for them, and they were made to feel that they were honored
guests. ,	\ z	...
And that was only proper. In other days when a team traveled to
another college to contest in sport the members of the visiting team
were. treated as almost; personal r enemies as well as opponents in a
;game. The game was. war and "everything’s fair in love and war.”
That era has passed; a new order has come. Last year at'Atlanta
.Notre Dame was given a wonderful welcome. It is up to the Notre
Dame men this year to repay her and to make the Georgia; team feel that
we appreciate‘the treatment that was. accorded us.; We’ll show them
. that hospitality is not limited to the south, and that northern hospitality
can equal that of our neighbors below'the line. .	. , / . /
THE BAND /!/■
What is -.there about a good band more than any other, good
musical:organization that thrills you? What is there that makes yoiir
:pulses quicken, that makes your heart-beats keep time to ,the .music?
You seem to know what it isj but at the same time you can’t tell just
WHAT it is. /	'■	- " ' I . ” <■' .//. ;
Then think of the orchestra, or the organ, or. perhaps the steam
- piano. r It is - the dance, the girl,; and perhaps the place, that /makes
7the good orchestra w^	Then.the:organ. ? It is yourself; your
'present 'emotions,/and. your surroundings- that, make or unmake a 'good
organ recital. And the steam piano. With the circus parade comes
•/the.steam piano. ; But,without the. parade,''tKe tunes of the steam piano
/fall up'on deaf ears. ..	.	,/	/	'/
. . - , With the band it is different. iNb matter where you are; no matter
who you are, no matter what the occasion or the need, you are thrilled
at .the first notes of a/band. - No matter whether it be upon, your own
/Cartier field,, or whether it.be on ,a’street in Ireland with, absolute
strangers - taking, part in one of ’their own celebrations;-no matter
whether it be a • German band playing: on a; street •corner;; your: pulses
quicken, and; you can/t account for the feeling thatiruns ^upt and down
your spine. '	:	' !■	■. /> .["•;.:/!<	:
We have in the past been thrilled with the music of the Notre
Dame band. We have always been thrilled by-it-hut- we found greater
. thrill in its music when it played at a-welcome for the "team, for a
snake /dance; for a football game on Cartier/$eld. ^	the,
1 occasion, has much to do; with our; delight’in the TnusicP //; \	' i
But now uniforms have been secured ^d .the/^ahd'sjiall ,seem

What They Say
‘ Issues of The Daily Princetonian,
the official daily of Princeton Uni-
versity, have reached ’the campus.
The issues contained' stories and .
comments Ton the Notre Dame-
Princetori game. '	’	/'
The Saturday issue, October 20,
contained a story1 oh Notre. Danie,
its founding, ' enrollment,- colleges,
etc., and a story on. the game, in
which Coach' Rockne was quoted
assaying: “I honestly'believe that
we will_be beaten/ . Of course' we—
will' do all we can to win but we
will consider it no disgrace to lose .
to a Princeton team.” ;1; ■
“Our hat is off to the Notre Dame

Our impressions of the bill at the

not see. over or around him. He
had no bad effect on the musical

tions to say what the performers
looked like.
We have collected the impression
of. six students. who made remarks
oh the bill, each commenting on
one number..
Margaret . and Morrell—“Their
songs.^and'dances were clever, and
their Cook’s tour reminded me of
the-first time I came out to Notre
Dame.”—Paul J. Frey.

“Their numbers were well executed,
but they should not have played
‘The World Is Waiting for the Sun-
rise,’. in. such close proximity to
‘Three O’Clock in the Morning?
The-violin and. cornet were espe-
cially good.”—Harold T. Thompson.
... Cully and .Claire—“The voices
blended exceptionally well, and it
would be difficult to say which of
.the members of. the team was the
most pleasing.” — Unknown Stu-
dent.
Marino and Martin—-“As a study
in wopology they. were more real
. than imitative. Marino could sing
if he wanted to, but. he didn’t get
around to it.”—Frederick Meehan.
The Destroying Angel—“Inter-
esting, but it does not sustain the
interest.”—Walter Haecker.

joyful rooters paraded under the
goal posts, tossing their hats over
the crossbar in reckless abandon.
Then, having partly spent their ex-
uberance in a victory demonstra-
tion such as has been the privilege
of ■ few colleges that have opposed
Princeton," the sons of Notre Dame
came to a halt before the stadium
towers and with lusty voices gave
expression to their college cry:
“He’s the man.
Who’s the man?
He’s a Notre Dame man.
Rockne! Rockne! Rockne!”
It was a tribute to the master
mind that, made this victory, pos-
sible a tribute to Knute Rockne,
the successful coach, and, though
the outcome of the game cut deep-
ly into the pride of Princeton ad-
herents, it must . be conceded that
Knute bane' have a great team.
[Newark, N. J., ;Sunday Call] -
Losing to Notre Dame in .mid-
seasori would not be regarded as a
calamity at Princeton. After all
such games are but stepping stones
to the battles with Harvard and
Yale.- But the manner in which the
Tigers were' outgeneraled and out-
played by the Indiana eleven left
Princeton stunned. Compared to
the slick-moving football machine
from South-Bend'the vaunted Jer-
sey eleven appeared like a raw
Hickville High School team, unable
to advance and utterly helpless in

basis for each of the units in that
system. ■	\
