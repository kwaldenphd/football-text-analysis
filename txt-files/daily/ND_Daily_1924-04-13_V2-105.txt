Talks to Scribblers
Aline Kilmer, widow of Joyce

poetry to the members of the
Scribblers at a special meeting Sat7
urday afternoon. She was intro-
duced by Rev. Charles L. O’Don-
nell, c. s. c. •
Mrs. Kilmer read a chapter, from
a book being prepared by her, and
also read and ’ commented upori
“They,” “Birthday of a Middle-
Aged Child,”, and a poem beginning
‘.‘Michael walks in autumn leaves.’
The poems and the chapter, as most
of her writings, were on the subject
of her children. The chapter, told
in her leisurely, colorful style, con-
cerned the incidents of an after-,
noon with her children. .It is one
of three chapters completed for the
contemplated; book. .	1

The Outstanding change in the
program will be the formal recep-
tion of the Prom guests at. the
Palais Royale from* 9 to 10:30.
This was thought expedient to ac-
commodate the guests from out-of-
town and St. Mary’s, and to do
away .with the' ancient complaints
about‘filate starts and, jumbled

GLEE CLUB GOES
TO OHIO CITIES ON
CONCERT TOUR
CONCERT TO BE GIVEN IN
FIVE OHIO CITIES DURING,
EASTER WEEK
Announcement that the Glee club
Easter concert tour would in-
clude appearances in Cleveland,
Akron, Niles, Elyria, and Sandusky,
was made yesterday following a
business meeting of the t club held
in the library. Final instructions
were issued to nieiribers of the or-
ganization, and plans were discussed
for the annual South Bend concert
to be held. May T. ,	/
The first concert will be presented
in Cleveland bn Easter Monday,
April 12.:: The Notre Dame cluBJof
Cleveland is sponsoring this appear-
ance, which will be in the ballroom
of , the Statler , hotel. Here, as
throughout the week, Dr.’ Browne
will direct. Elaborate preparations,
have been made for a ball following
the concert.	'	'	-
Two Thousand Reservations
.'. ■ . ■ . ■ . . -.	>.	■ - \ i	• :
Tuesday the. club will sing jn
Akron, at the armory, under the
auspices, of the Knights of Colum-
bus, and the Notre Dame club of
Akron. It is reported that more
than two' thousand, reservations
have already been made for this
concert and dance.. On Wednesday
Niles, an Ohio city where last year’s
organization scored an ■ Easter suc-
cess, .will be given a program in the
McKinley Memorial building, ar-
rangements- having:_been._-made . Jiy
the Knights of Columbus of £hat
city. Dancing will follow the songs;
Elyria is on the schedule for. Thurs-
day evening. , T	.
The Knights of Columbus of San-
dusky are bringing Notre Dame’s
songsters( back to their city on Fri-
day evening. It was. at' Sandusky
that the 1923 club scored its big-
gest success ‘ during; .last Easter’s
tour. With this in mind Sandusky
has engaged the largest auditorium
in town, and expects to make this
year’s concert a greater success than
the former .one. Sandusky- con-
cludes the cities now on the list for
Easter week. -	■	<
. <	' J
- .	. Go .to Chicago Later, ; ;
Members of the Glee club will
work during vacation on plans for
the South Bend concert, arid dance
to be given at the Palais Royale on
May. i: Within a week or so after
the South Bend engagernent, Dr.
Browne will take the club to Chi-
cago. As Dr. Browne is well
known/for .his many musical tri-
umphs in; that city, the Chicago’con-
cert should prove a memorable one.
Joseph Casasanta, assistant di-
rector of the club, left- last week
for his home in Milford, Mass. He
will join ' the club in? Cleveland on
Easter Monday. ,	.
Some Go Home For Easter Vacation;
' Others, Broke, ‘^Winter/f in South Bend
the Palais.) ?	’.1 .
Another startling, fact brought to
light is. the intended conduct of the
Walshites. Of course, the fourth
floor will' continue to- remain dor-
. Once more Easter with its free'
days ’ rolls around to, break the
monotony for the lawyers- and for,
the. commerce men—the'rest of us;
must continue tb labor in order to.
get caught' up .with last’ quarter’s’
work. ;Therefore, next Tuesday at’
noori, the aforesaid LLB.s and. Ph.;
B.s of. Comm, will dash madly from;
court and, accounting, change to
the otheryshirt, and with their rooni-
mate’s tooth brush radiate in; all
directions -. to those famous cities
known,as “home towns.” .	■ ■
. Other of us less fortunate, Litt.
B.s, etc. (haying caught up in oui’
public speaking)—may find time—I
doubt, it: seriously,, however—to ex-
change pens for /putters, euphony
for U-Drivits, and phonetic sourids.
for phoney phone numbers. . (We
also' may be .’able. to get in a few
fox. trots instead; of fox passes at
mant . during the morning hours,
and the, other. inmates declare -that
they will brave the list of : the. pro-
scribed ? and say their morning
prayers in bed, thus rendering nil
all'the character infused in them
throughout the year by the rector
of the'.hall. .	v ' •
Dan Hickey and 'his henchmen,
“Curley Frank,”' and “Joe, .the
Poet,” are doing their best to put
the Juggler out before vacation be-
gins. Then, only a wild surmise
cduld; be- ventured as to what they
will do. .	/ > < 1 ;: ; , ' '	.
All in all, boys, it will-be a great
Week, (or weak?). .Arid a Joy bus

VERGARA’S HIT IN SIXTH
GIVES IRISH
VICTORY
ATLANTA, Ga., April 12.—Notre
Dame opened its 1924 baseball sea-
son here today by registering a 4
to 3 victory over the Georgia Tech
team. The Irish won from Allison,
pitching ace for the Yellow Jackets,
by bunching their hits in the fifth
and sixth innings. \ .	-
“Red” Magevney, veteran Notre
Dame hurler, started the game on
the mound, hurling six innings be-
fore being relieved by Jim Dwyer.
Though both men were hard hit,
they kept the bingles scattered.
It was George Vergara’s timely
single in the sixth with. three men
on the bags that gave the Irish the
victory. Silver’s .catching was an-
other feature, the Notre Dame back-
stop catching .three Tech runners
off the bags. Score:	.

- A union building to be built as soon as possible.
A well-organized student body, residing on the camptis.
True recognition of; good scholarship and a better appreciation -
for the efforts, of men in. campus activities.
HOW MANY?
:Most people read but: sixteen serious books in-their lifetime, says
Professor Robert M. t Lovett. ■ A writer in “Extension” says, that the
professor exaggerates, and althpugh the statements of. the two men are,
at first, surprising/ohe is inclined to agree.
The best seller > is the Bible, but most people buy that to put । it
■ “bn a shelf and calk it great.” ; When they buy • Shakespeare, Dante,
, • Milton, and the rest, they do the same thing. ’Much of this lack of
interest in “serious books” is due to the fact that.they are so labeled.
-We treat Shakespeare with a curious kind of remoteness, as if he..were
a . god that spoke things incomprehensible- to ordinary minds. We
forget that^ in his.time, he was as popular a playwright as Avery Hop-
. wood or J.-M.: Barrie. He was'a. man, and a very human one at-that.
..The brand of literature is the brand of death to'literature. Because
< of this fear of the great, the bestsellers that-we read are the ephemeral
- nonentities. .	<	?	.
Do college students.read the “serious books”? Po you?
A COMPLETE FAILURE ' ?
“Girl Shy”
x . Harold Lloyd’s latest eight reel
comedy, “Girl Shy,” which has not
yet been officially released, was
given 'an advanced showing in the
LaSalle theater Thursday morning.
In the cast supporting him are Jo-
byna. Ralston, and' Richard Daniels.
The picture is not Lloyd’s .'best
because there are; times when the
action is slow, ,but during the last
few reels-this inaction is made, up
for in the characteristic Lloyd man-
ner ofi .“Why Worry”, and “Safety
Last.” It is in-the last-part that
our spectacled hero has thrilling ad-
ventures in speeding automobiles,
on frightened horses, on a speed
cop’s motorcycle, and on a runaway
street car, while he is hurry to. pre-
vent the girl he loves ,from: marry-
ing a ,man of disreputable charac-
ter./- Needless, to mention, the, ag-
gressive Lloyd succeeds,. and cap-
tures the young bride for himself.
Lloyd'is. a tailor’s apprentice ,in
a small >town where the inhabitants
feed from day to day on the scan-
dalthat grows..out of-the, town’s
only . ; dissipation—the Saturday
night dance. - He is . more bashful
’even that the ordinary country
youth; in fact, when a girl talks .to
(him he becomes so frustrated he
pan do nothing but stutter when he
attempts to talk-
i He has a literary bent, and imag-
ining that he knows all about wo-
men that, there is to be known, he
writes a book concerning them.
While on the train to the city where
he is to see a publisher, he meets a
wealthy young Miss Mary Bucking-
ham, and his first romance begins.
When they reach the city and leave
one another, he learns that women
are not exactly as he had imagined
in his novel. Nevertheless he pre-
sents it ..to the publisher, returns
home, and • dreams of the girl he
had met on the train.
The girl too, longs to see her new
acquaintance, and after a series of
comical incidents they meet again,
only to find that they are madly .in
love with each other.
When Harold received his rejec-
tion from the publisher, he realized
that all of his chances. to become
financially successful were ruined,
and so he leads.Mary to believe
that he was insincere in his lo.ve
foi’iher so as not to deprive her ,of
a chance to marry .the wealthy. Ru-
dolph DeVore. And Mary, believ-
ing that he actually did not lo.ve

dents.” It . was , to be -a collegiate gathering. What actually hap-
pened was that prohibition was the only topic discussed and more
than one-fourth of the; members in attendance were, not college - stu-
dents at all. .	...	•	7
There were numerous speeches, several resolutions were railroaded
through in a. manner to shame a political caucus, and1: the college 'stu-
dents who attended went home • disgusted. - Such conferences are an
affront to the intelligence of a cdllege stiiaent, and in result are worse
than none at all.	-	_

NOTRE DAME FOUR-
TEEN TIMES
' ' Statistics gathered from past
: performances of the University of
’ Illinois track team have a signifi-
cant bearing on track history in the
United States in that they point to
the Urbana school as being the
home of some of the greatest track
•.teams rin the country. Harry Gill,
. without exception, has enjoyed the
; most brilliant track coaching career
of which the history of the cinder
~ sport can boast.
During the 20 years that Harry
- Gill has guided the track destinies
< of the Fighting Illini, he has been
.- defeated by only two conference
schools and one non-conference in-
stitution. Chicago and Wisconsin
have the singular honor of having:
lowered the colors of the Suckers
12'times during two decades., • Cal-
ifornia has been the only outside
team to take the measqre of the
Gillman and, next Saturday, Illi-
nois will meet ’ California on the
cinders for .the third time, and a
: desperate attempt will be made to
. defeat the. Bruins who won the first
two meets.
' Notre Dame has, been one of the
- four most frequent competitors . of
the Gillmen and in /the 14. times
■ that the two schools have met in
dual meets, , the Fighting Irish have
always lost the encounter. Notre
’ 'Dame came very close to winning
.the indoor encounter in 1923 when/
S • the relay was the deciding event on
/ the program. ' Illinois has a good
■ chance to. defeat the Bruins and
J .will probably be one of the headline
t performers at the Drake games,
; April,25-26.' The Suckers will come
; to Notre Dame on May. 10, for a
; dual- meet and if Notre Dame
, should win on that day, the Fight-
' • ing- Irish will lfave earned'for them-'
nselves-a high place in the history
'. , (Continued on Page 4.) »
The Electrical Engineers baseball
team defeated^ the diamond squad
from the Miners’ department, 16-
12, Friday afternoon. The men
from the Electrical department
featured the game with their smooth
fielding.
Sturges of the Miners twirled a
nice game, but failed to get the
support of his team. The Miners
showed to the best advantage when
at bat, and a little more practice
together should make them one of
the most aggressive ball clubs in
the league.	'.
The baseball interest in the En-
gineering league has been height-
ened by the announcement that a
pennant would be given to the team
winning the Engineering league
title. The pennant is being ■ do-
nated by the Clauer sporting goods
store.

BEGINS PRACTICE
ON
UNIQUE PITCHER
, The Notre Dame golf team; be-
ing. favored by moderate weather,
have begun preparations for the
spring season. The matches with
two conference schools this year
mark the first time in the history
of the school that conference golf
teams have competed with . Notre
Dame players.
Indiana and Northwestern will
tee-up with -the Irish squad, and
Loyola of Chicago ■will be the other
school to appear' on the golf slate
as far as it is now completed. The
Chicago s.chool will meet Notre
Dame of May 3, while Northwestern
will journey to South. Bend for a
match on May 10. The Indiana
university team will meet the locals
on May 23. .	,
Golf is one of the foremost of.
the. minor sports in the Big Ten
athletic circle and without excep-
tion enjoys a large following among
the conference collegians. Several
of the universities have their own
courses, and included in the ranks
of the college players are many
performers who have starred in
amateur tournaments.
The Notre Dame golf team will
be built around a group of players,
who made up the squad last year.
The list follows: Ward, Foglia,
Harris, Adams, Mouch, .and Corbett.
Adams holds the university golf
title and won amateur laurels in a
city tournament at the Chain-o’-
Lakes last fall. From the ranks of
the freshmen golfers of last year,
DeLeo is> perhaps the most promis-
ing player. • RaynBartzen; qf last

of mid-western track.
• i The Suckers -will be strong in the
. field events where Notre Dame will
- ; be weak, and the nearest approach
to equality will -be in the javelin
throw. The mile and two-mile will
. be nip and tuck aifairs, while the
Suckers'will hold the advantage in
the hurdles. The sprints and ■ mid-
die distance runs will be among the
most spectacular events on the
program. Illinois will present; a
coterie of fast men, but the Notre
' Dame men will push the Suckers
. all the way: .	.
. In the 20 years of the Gill re-
• gime, the Fighting Illini have par-
ticipated in 101 dual meets; won
85, lost 14 and tied two. .
Illinois has won 7 of the 20 out-
door conference meets and 7 of the
14. indoor . meets, taking second
place 5 times. .
The success of the Illinois track
team, which was something un-
known to the Urbana school prior
to the ascendency of Harry Gill in
1904, is attributed directly to the
coach’s thorough knowledge of the
track sport. He is a most capable
handler of track men and for this
reason alone was. asked to become
one of the chief coaches of the
American Olympic track

, Williams Shaving Cream is just as much
pleasanter to use as is the Hinge-Cap. It
softens the beard with uncanny speed. The
thicker lather holds the moisture in against .
the skin where it is needed. -This lather lu- .
bricates the skin, too, so,that painful razor
. . friction is eliminated. And when your shave
•is done, that famous ingredient in Williams .
which helps the skin, leaves your face cool,
soothed and refreshed. No coloring matter
is used in Williams •—it is a pure, natural-
