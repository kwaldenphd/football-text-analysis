Father John F. O’Hara, prefect

of entertainment* at the regular
meeting of the Knights jof Colum-

evening. Father O’Hara in his talk
on “Something to Think About,”
told of the result of a religious sur-:

Emminent Author Once Professor
ar Notre Dame; Was Former
Minister to Denmark.
Dr. Maurice Francis Egan, for-
mer minister to Denmark, died at
his home in Brooklyn last Wednes-
day afternoon. He had been ill '
for several months. Although he '
was a resident of Brooklyn for
many years, he will be taken to his
home in Philadelphia, where he will
be buried from the Cathedral in .
that city at 7 o’clock Saturday
morning.
In 1888 Dr. Egan became pro-
fessor of literature at Notre Dame.
Dr. Egan came to Notre Dame to
fill the chair vacted by the resigna-
tion of another brilliant man of let-
ters, Charles Warren Stoddard. He
had for years been editor of the
Freeman Journal and had attained .
wide popularity through that pub-
lication. He was also known to
lovers of delicate verse for his. de-
lightful volume entitled, “Pre-
ludes.” .	- .	’
Dr. Egan at once became the
rage, upon, the campus. . In the
courts. of Europe his native sense
of humor, his exquisite manners,
and his rich and colorful talk would
have given him the spotlight. In
our college world he might easily
have been elected Kaiser-for life.
He came to his classes every day.
wearing, a beautiful bouttonier, and
was only amused when one fine day,
his students met him each wearing
a screaming yellow dandelion in his
coat lapel.. Doctor Egan’s reaction
was instantaneous and character-
wonderful, eyes, a smile not even
half concealed under • the. striking
majestic beard; Doctor Egan ex-
changed his own bunch of violets,
for a student’s dandelidh . and a
happy lecture ran its usual course..
Doctor Egan always, dressed well,
and refinement exhaled from him
like the perfume from his own
lilacs. That was what he called his
home,—the house built for a him
when he came to join the faculty—
the “Lilacs.” It is a brick house,
the.first on the left side on the way
in town on the car line. , It was for
years the home of Prof. Peterson,
and is now occupied by Mrs. Peter-,
son and sundry students. - The
“Lilacs’” was for years the Mecca
of literary men in America. Some

Vers Libre is French. It falls
trippingly. from the tongue and
soothingly on the ears.- It sounds
learned. Hence as an expression
it is respectable. It can be used by
the near-learned to impress the un-
learned with their learning. More-
over, vers libre is modern. And in
modern times that is in its favor.
It is,. so to speak, one of us. In
fact, being modern is about the best
thing in:its favor. We get tired of
the old, not so much, because the
old things are old,—for- only really
good things grow bld,'and .the good
is ever young—but because they
grow old to us, for whom accus-
tomed things soon lose their inter-

The freest thing about vers libre
is its freedom from any suspicion of
poetry. We do not complain of or
oppose such ■ freedom.- We only
cbmplain that it should be called
poetry. We want the . poets to be
free. We don’t , want them to be-
come freebooters. We don’t ob-

piracy. We love liberty; we hate

Yes, nominally at least,..vers
libre is French. .In America, it is
supposed to be a form of poetry.
In English, so we are told, it means
“free verse.” The chief claim to
excellence in that rendition of it is-
that “verse” is not made synony-
mous with poetry, and that “free”
most certainly indicates the. essen-
tial attribute of the subject.
■	THE CONTEST ~
It can scarcely be doubted that our campus is over-organized. And.
because there are so many Organizations whose existence; may be discoy-
ered. only by looking through the Dome, the real organizations, those
that, do things for. their members and for the school, are apt to be
sadly .-lost in the confusion. -	-
- ; The DAILY wants these worth-while organizations to be rewarded
' public sentiment." And if every man who takes enough interest in
our campus affairs to vote in this contest, will but ;be fair instead of
phrtialj our ideal end will be realized—the best organizations will win.
It might be best to allow no one to vote for an organization of
which'he is a member—-some think this should, be one. of the rules of
’ the contest.' But we have an implicit faith in the average Notre Dame
man,/which, tells us ' that his votes will be cast as his true judgment
. dictates?/And besides, if a man conscientiously believes an . organiza-
tion to which he belongs to .be the best on the campus, in-fairness to
7.. . him he.should be allowed to vote for that organization, and to convince
others that they should vote the same way. 7 ; ..
'	. The race is on—may the best organizations win ! . '	. ' .
OUR MASCOT \
■^-^Student^opinioh7secms-t(^-have^j^enrah~aflirmativ<:7m^^
question:1 Should:the Notre Dame football team have a mascot? And
while' there is yet some disagreement as ' to what animal; should be
chosen for this purpose, the Irish, terrier apparently has the edge in
popularity... '	.	/	.	. . . . ..
\	' .‘ There are many reasons for choosing the Irish terrier, as a mascot.
The very, name is in harmony with our established title of -Fighting
Irish. .7 But the Irish, terrier has more than its name to recommend it
as a. suitable mascot for the football team.	.	7
.. The:;chief characteristics of the terrief .are gameness, grit, and
- activity; yet he is also very affectionate and faithful. As one of the
pluckiest dogs in the-world; therefore, the Irish terrier might well
typify the plucky spirit of our team. And as one hardly equalled in
affection for his master,-he might well typify, the team’s devotion to
the' Virgin and? her school. "	.
7	. TheTNbtre Dame football team has always'been one of the most
" popular in'.the'country. -The Irish terrier has always maintained its
popularity wherever the lovers of fine dogs are found. It would seem
appropriate to have this" respected animal chosen to represent a re-
spected team. : .	.	7	. -
Now of course one makes him-
self obnoxious in opposing any
movement for freedom. It is as-
sumed generally enough that free-
dom in any sense is one of the in-
alienable rights of man,-—arid,
therefore, also of the poet. That
beirig so,' the poets will doubtless
feel (i.e., if they are free-versefs)
that they not only may, but are iri
duty, bound to defend this particu-
lar urge—or surge—toward it. .
We are willing to admit that
poetry and poets should be free.
Indeed, what poet was ever fetter-
ed?. Is not: poetic license already
a- literary institution? To what
rilass of men is greater indulgence
shown ; for eccentricities of ariy
kind? Has not a none-too-benign
publicTong and patiently condoned,
not only .the flowing locks and the
jaunty dress affected by the lighter
krndAbut also .the. delicate_tempera-;
the heart, the emotions; that it
should reach down to the .finer
strands within .us. and strike^ them
to music audible to the’inner ear.
We fancied that it should minister,
not so much to the. life of the
senses, but very much to the life
of the soul. . We looked upon it as
a hand-maid of Religion—a trum-
pet of God. \	.
But the old order changeth, and
so we have “freedom” and soul-
hunger and vers libre. We heard a
philosopher say recently—not the
most. impartial witness perhaps—
that the philosophy of vers libre
was Nominalism. We are not too
strong on philosophy, but if Nom-
inalism means reducing the heart of-
things to mere names, and the
things of. the spirit to patches, of
color and sensations that tickle the
ear, and mere images-that carry you
into the market-place or at best
the wilderness, then we think the
philosopher was right, but not com-
pletely right. For though he im-
plied, he did not say, that vers
libre is grounded on a.philosophy of
sand. . ' ——.i.._	.
We console ourselves according-
ly. For it will never grow old.
.Sand is -shifting. It has buried
many more- precious, .things than
vers libre. But French has rarely
.been more roundly abused; i-X -

- ligion. .	'	;	;
. Books could be written with such a fact in mind; but since we
cannot write a book,.we can at least express a deep,-deep thankfulness
' that we are not included in the sixty-two per cent.	;
v.. .Perhaps they are to' be' blamed; but they are even more to be
; pitied.' 7 They are people blindly racing over the short course of their
- little existence, without a thought or a care concerning what lies beyond
their brief life on earth—with' no goal, no destination. They, are foolish.
We ourselves cannot claim great wisdom. But at least we have
some purpose in life besides living. We realize that life without an
. after-life .would be like a sleep without an awakening—something not
given to mortal man to experience. So we look to the future, and pity
the'pathetic sixty-two per cent who refuse to see the-chasm until; they
tumble into it. -	'	.	.	.	.
Those who lack vision are bound to. die in the vise.. That is the

' That.sixty-two per cent of the people of Indiana profess that they

Editor, The DAILY:	.	'
. Some of the prominent individ-
. uals about the campus have intro-
duced the team “cake-eater” . into
the university vocabulary. Just
’ what the term connotes I am at a
loss to know. It is even more in-
definite than the 100 per cent Amer-
• icans of war days. Is it that these
people are assinine enough to ques-
tion the mental or physical capacity
- 'of a man because he happens to
own a tuxedo and is not averse to
. donning it a few times during a
vacation?
It is my candid opinion that so-
cial life is as essential to student
life as any other form of activity,
and itjs a reflection on the mental-
ity of an individual when he asserts
that because a man does not wear
. corduroy , trousers, hob nail shoes
. and indiscreminately expectorate
the juice of Mai! Pouch about the
. . premises he must be a cake eater.
We are told by our professors that
; in entering discussions and making
.	- assertions we should be certain of
. terms. Is there anyone who would
- care to submit a real definition of a
cake eater?	.	.
Now it is time that we abolish
. this term from the Notre Dame vo-
cabulary and realize that the accu-
mulation of social-grace is a part of
. our education and not an indication
of deterioration.

at Omaha. The announcement that
he had signed a' contract for three
years came direct from A. A. Schabr
inger, athletic‘director of that in-
stitution./	..	. .
While a student at Notre Dame,
Wynne became nationally famous
as one of Rockne’s star backfield

ah important’ factor in the past
track . history, of Notre Dame.
Among his many notable . achieve-
ments, one of the most prominent
was the equalling of the record for
the indoor low hurdles of 50 yards.
He shattered numerous indoor track
records of his time.

Indoor Track Schedule
Announced by Rockne
- Coach Knute K. Rockne an-
nounced the indoor track schedule
yesterday afternoon for the var-
sity, freshman and interhall teams.
The varsity card will include some
very elegant • opposition ■with two
conference schools to be run off
in the Notre Dame gym. The re-
mainder of the winter card .will
take in a dual meet with the crack
Illinois tracksters at Urbana and a
squad will also be seen in action at
the annual Illinois indoor relays,
which were founded by Harry Gill,
Illinois coach, in 1917.
The annual Varsity-Freshman
handicap and the Gold and Blue
meet have also been scheduled for
early next month. Frosh trackmen
showing the best form in the handi-
cap meet will be sent to Culver to
meet the cadets'in the annual event.
Freshmen who have been excused
from gym classes for participation
in football will be required to keep
in training either in track, basket-
ball, boxing of. wrestling. Interhall
will come in for greater considera-.
tion in track during this year than
ever before,, .when'medals will be
given for the first four places. The
preliminaries for the interhall meet
will be run off in two sections arid
the first eight in each ’ event' will
qualify for the finals. The. inter-
hall meet will provide splendid op-
portunity for a large number of
men on the campus who feel that
they can do something in track, but
heretofore have not trie dout. The
slightest flash of ability will place
the entrant somewhere in the first
eight, and with a little practice,.the
finals might reveal to several mien
ability they did not know they had.
Special events will be carded for
the Varsity-Freshman meets, to in-
clude fa|t men, bakeball players,
football centers, guards, tackles,
ends, quarterbacks, halfbacks, full-
backs, and basketball men.
With the Northwestern meet but
ten days off, the Irish tracksters
are going through hard practice ses-
sions in the gym every afternoon,
and from present indications will be
in top form to meet the Purple
stars. :■	■	■____

NOTRE 'DAME DAILY
THE RUB DOWN
By TOM COMAN
Titles, championships, et cetera,
as applied to the various branches
of athletics are variable to say the
least. Very often this applies to
basketball more than any other
sport, but while the middle west is
talking about the first-rate basket-
ball teams of Franklin, Creighton
and other smaller colleges, we might
revert to the East and take into
consideration a high school, where
basketball teams of championship
calibre seem to crop out each year
as a matter of habit.
Passaic high school, New Jersey,
since 1919, has been the talk of
basketball circles. From that date
till the present day, thd eastern
prep school stars, under the master-
ful tutelage of . Ernest A. Blood,
have made a record of winning 124
consecutive basketball games from
some of the best high schools on the
Atlantic seaboard. This record is
. a real world-header and all the
credit has been laid at the feet of
Coach Blood. The Buffajlb Ger-
mans held the world’s record at
one time when they boasted of 112
consecutive victories, but the prep
school stars have passed-that mark
and from all indications may con-
tinue the pace for some time to
come. .
Another feature of this record is
that no other high school in the
country has piled as many century
point victories as the Passaic
high school. The Bloodmen have
^12 “100-point victories”, to their
credit.
This high school has turned, out
court stars in large numbers and
fortunate is the college that gets
the Passaic eagers. xMany times, of
course, this rule does not hold true,
and hundreds of prep stars have en-
tered college only to flivver in ath-
letics.
Among the more spectacular per-
formers developed at the Jersey
school is Bobby Thompson who
alone scored 1,000 'points in a.sin-
gle season, and Roosma, the main
. attraction of the West , Point quin-
tet.	.
It is a notable fact that the bril-
liant victory by the Notre Dame
basketball team over the Michigan
five has elicited the praise of Indi-
ana ^papers ai/d particularly the
Indiana Catholic. The article rel-
ative to Notre Dame’s sudden re-
turn to her old position in the bas-
ketball world was evidently writ-
ten by someone who was possessed
of an intimate knowledge of Notre
Dame during past years.
Speaking; of. the basketball situa-
tion at -Notre Dame the writer
pointed out the influence of the
new coach and emphatically assured
the readers that in former years
Notre Dame was represented, by
some very fine court squads, and
that basketball spirit in those days
compared favorably . with the na-
. tionally famous football spirit. The
reference was to the.time of Pete.

“Fighting Trish” every minute it
was on the court.
In 1909, the Irish played a 30-
game card and won 24 court en-
counters, which included a southern
trip on. which the Blue and Gold
garnered 16 out of 18 games. The
same year, Notre Dame "dropped
two games to the world-beating
Buffalo Germans.
This year Notre Dame has a team
and a coach and the Irish gave an
impressive exhibition of basketball
in the Michigan game, but since
then, the players seem to have hit a
slump, which if continued may
prove the downfall of the season’s
card.
Coach Keogan’s men, having won
six out of eight games, will be on
edge next Saturday night when the
elegant quintet from Franklin col-
lege appear on the “Y” court. The
Notre Dame eagers will have all the
reason in the world to be pointed
for the Franklin game, the biggest
home game, on the season’s card.
The press all over the country will
watch this struggle with ho little in-
terest, and if in the course of hu-
man events, Franklin is slated for
a defeat before the season is over;
so: Notre Dame might take that
task upon herself when the down-
staters break into the spotlight in
the Irish camp Saturday'night.
Big games have been won and
lost on spirit. Nebraska built a
fighting fevor in her students just
before the Notre Dame game last
fall, and the Huskers played as they
had never played before. When the
Nebraskans came to South Bend in
1921 to play before the Homecom-
ing crowd, the student spirit was at
its height on -that day. . The very
stands trembled .with 20,000 fans
rabid with fight and yelling mad.:
The Huskers were a powerful team
but Notre Dame won 7-0. . /
The Maylmen will be. in fighting
trim Saturday flight and the Frank-,
lin eagers are going to meet a foe
more formidable than any they
have ever met before. ■ Notre Dame
will have to play their best, since
the visitors will be dangerous from
any part of the floor and every min-
ute of the game. February 24,
1916,' Notre Dame beat Franklin,
27-16.	;
Since the re-opehing of the ath-
letic activities at Notre Dame after
the Christmas vacation, the gym
has been teeming with cinder track
candidates, basketball men, boxers
and wrestlers. A news dispatch
says, that Wisconsin had 2,017 men
out for track last year. Notre Dame
with an enrollment hardly making
the 2,000 mark is finding a greater
number of men turning out for ath-
letics every year.	,
Let the team know that you know
they’re good—at the Franklin game.

IRISH STRENGTH IS
PROVEN IN GAME
Should Prove Cure for Any Over-
Confidence; N. D. Primed for
Clever Franklin Five.
Notre Dame’s decisive victory
over Loyola in the game at ChicagQ
last night indicates that the Irish
team has come back to its stride of
the Michigan game. If that contest
two weeks ago had a psychological
effect on the team, giving them such
a shower of confidence that they let
up on their, early-season form, the
Loyola game has given them the im-
petus necessary to reverse their
form, and make it possible for them
to step in1 and defeat the wonder
team of the country.
Franklin has six court performers
that could make any team in the
country, and when teamed togeth-
er are able to defeat some of the
best teams in the country. Gant,
Vandiver, 0. Friddle and Ballard
played together in. high school and
during the years 1920 and 1921,
won the state basketball title. This
clever scoring combination entered
Franklin college and -with the addi-
tion of another of the high school
players, have swept, all the opposi-;
tion- that has been placed in front
of them. ... .	-	.	•
Last year was practically the first
year that Franklin was ever repre-
sented by such., a. world-beating
basketball ' team. To increase the
sensation of their work, they
stepped . out and defeated. Butler,
DePauw and Wabash .in five days.
This year witnesses a continua-
tion of.their game of last season,
and they have already beaten But-
ler, which - trimmed Chicago, Wis-
consin, one of the conference head-
liners, and Marquette; the first time
beaten on their home floor. Iowa
lost to Marquette and beat Purdue/
only to come, home and give up the
ghost to Creighton by. a big score.
The Franklin, outfit is the most
versatile basketball quintet now
playing and-has been the sensation
of the season , with their ability to
hit the basket from all angles and
parts of the floor. Their courage
ard endurance die remarkable and
it has been one of the noticeable
facts in the season games that they
play their best when they are a lit-
tle behind in the ’ score. . Advance
dope: elevates Vandiver to the posi-
tion of one of the greatest court
performers that has been, developed
in many years. .	' . .	.

The doctor was a great teacher
of literature because he had the
happy faculty of communicating to
his students his own enthusiasm and
appreciation. He knew French well
and. his spirits; and manners were
often suggestive of the French.
He was a noble character, a true
friend, a' most noble friend. His
talk, like his writings, radiated pur-
ity and exhaltation, and no one ever
was in doubt about the faith he
professed. A vast deal of innocent
joy and. sparkling humor perished
when he died.
