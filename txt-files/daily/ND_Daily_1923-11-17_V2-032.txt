GIVES LECTURE
“The General Structure of the
Atom” Is Subject of Lecture
Given the Chemists.
Dr. W. D. Harkins, noted Chi-
cago chemist, gave an interesting
lecture at the regular meeting of
the Northern Indiana ' Section of
the American Chemical Society,
held Wednesday at 8:30 in room

spoke on the “General Structure
of the Atom.” He gaye a detailed
account. of the more recent discov-
eries concerning it and also gave
the audience.the results of various
researches conducted both by him-
self and other chemists- in regard
to the division of atoms, the struc-
ture, activity and composition of
electrons, and several new theories
on chlorine and mercury.' The lec-r
ture was accompanied • by. a' • special
showing of stereopticon slides that
illustrated the' various examples
given by/ Dr. Harkins. The pic-
tures were taken by a newly per-
fected camera, able to take two
complete views of an object from
different angles.	-	:	'
Dr. Harkins is professor of
physical chemistry at the Univer-
sity of Chicago, where he has con-
ducted . most of his recent investi-
gations. He is nationally known as
being' among the best in his, par-
ticular line of work.. > .	.
Following the talk of Dr. Hark-/
jns a general discussion of -.the
atom followed, in which he answer-
ed'many questions that are of cur-
rent interest in the (field of physi-
cal-chemistry. -Owing to the ab-
sence of the chairman, Rev. Julius
F. Nieuwland introduced the speak-
er and presided at the meeitng. !
As the lecture occupied the en-
tire evening the business of the so-
ciety was postponed until the next

BUTLER HERE
IN LAST GAME
Capital City Team to Play Irish
Saturday in Last Home
:	Game of Season.
Rockne’s Fighting Team will
make its last home appearance for
the season when it stacks up
against the Butler college aggrega-
tion on Cartier field this afternoon.
In preparing to hand the down-
state squad a big jolt that will land
them out of the state title running,
the Notre Dame football team has
gone through some strenuous prep-
arations during the past week,
Coach Rockne has the squad in that
fighting mettle that characterized
its -invasion of the East and the
men are ready to steam roller the
Butler defense this afternoon.
Every man on the team is in good
physical condition after the gruel-
ling fight at Lincoln last Saturday.
The capital warriors will appear
today with hopes running high of
making an x impressive showing
against the . Fighting Irish. The
Butler team has made a remarkable
showing in all its games since the
season opened, ..including rhe Illi-
nois tilt, when they, derived great
satisfaction in holding Zuppke’s
proteges to a low score. Last Sat-
urday, the downstaters defeated-
Wabash in a brilliant game in which
their two backfield stars, Woojds
and Griggs, performed in crashing ,
style; - -	' >
In Hal Griggs, Butler has a great
range drop kicker, who booted.a 52-
iyard field..goaljin..the	of
:thie: season against Chicago Y. M.
G. A. college. Last year, in the
Notre; Dame-Butler clash, it was .
only through the work of Griggss
educated toe that the downstaters
garnered three, points. •
. In recalling last year’s game, we
are reminded of. the fact that in ,
this struggle, .Notre Dame lost the
services . of. her ‘ great fullback,
Paul Castner. The triple threat
artist whose presence was sadly
missed in the Nebraska /game of
that year, was injured in the mid-
dle of the game when his hip was
fractured in a rough tackle. With
the loss of Castner, following the
injuries of Lieb and. Carberry,
Notre Dame’s hopes of further tri-
umph were blasted. . •
. Butler has a shift that is as
unique and colorful as the one ex-
ecuted by Georgia Tech. Through
its functioning, the linemen gain a
powerful momentum when charging.
It also serves to protect the passer.
Against .this shift, Rockne has spent
part of the week’s practice sessions >
in developing a suitable defense.
In the coterie of Notre Dame’s
offensive tactics, the ;Irish are pre-
pared to uncork some .new stunts
that have • been; unleashed from
Rockne’s headquarters this week.
. . On the regular scrimmage night
in the Rockmen’s camp, the Frosh
opposed several shifts of the. Var-
sity, who executed the new plays
with perfect precision. Max Hous-
er, Cerney.: and .Connell composing
the first trio, displayed some neat:
work in lugging the ball- through
the heavy Frosh line; ~
; Pate. Page’s/crew is stilt holding
but on the hope of . upsetting the
Irish/ with, the influence . of / the
Rockmen’s defeat of last week'still ,
clinging to their, minds/ ; A witness
of the Homecoming game: with Pur-
due, returned to Butler with the'
report that Notre Dame had more
than a football team; they had an
army. Butler realizes one thing
from the game: of last year; that;
Notre Dame is strong in reserve
material. ’	' • -	/ - . ; ‘

TO THOSE WHO CAN READ
' ‘ One week ago today a whistle'blew in far-off Nebraska. Eleven
Notre. Danie men stood for a moment, dazed, stunned, scarce realizing
what /that whistle signified. ■ The “wonder team” of America -was
/ defeated.	■/
One week ago today our gymnasium was filled with a trembling,
' smoky haze, and a great silence.. Little lights stopped flickering on
the Gridgraph—a .quick, electric flash cried, “Quarter Over”—two
thousand Tiearts near burst,.. two - thousand throats tightened convul-
' sively.	,	'.
/ And then—w^’re saying this so that, you may know it, Nebraska
-—those two thousand Notre Dame men, men who believe in doing
one’s best to take; victory with modesty, and defeat without alibis, those
two thousand men conquered the pain in their hearts and gave a “Big
U. N. D. for Nebraska.” Their last' cheer was for' you, Nebraska,
and if you didn’t hear it,-it was not the fault of those defeated men
who cheered you to the echo in your victory.
- Oils-week ago today—we, are saying this to bur team—you
trudged off a foreign field with heads bowed. But you had the great-
est right to hold your heads with pride. Perhaps you did lose the
football championship of the world. But, beaten and bruised, stung
even by the insults of your hosts, you came off that .field with more
glory in defeat than many another team has found in victory.
OUR ALMA MATER DAY
,The final suggestion : of Tast .year’s graduating class to the Uni-
versity was tliaf"a traditional Alma Mater Day be established at Notre
Dame. Since September of this year there has been a-seeming forget-
fulness of the suggstion and nothing has been said^or accomplished
_ towards -making it a reality. This editorial does not present a new
; suggestion; it merely recalls the attention of the student body and
■ of■ the Student Activities Committee to the value of an Alma Mater
Day for the University of Notre Dame.
The plan as it'was outlined in a. spring issue'of. T/ie Scholastic
embodied these ideas: A certain day, probably in the early • spring,
would be dedicated to the honoring of the Alma Mater of Notre Dame
men. On that day, graduates and old students would send, cards and
: letters and little:gifts to the University, honoring the blessed Lady to
whom’Notre, Dame is dedicated. The day would partake of' the nature
of a Valentine Day with expressions of love and gratitude pouring in
upon' the■ gentle ? Mother of us : all, ;the: Lady of the Lake. Here at
Notre Dame, the day would be celebrated with ceremonies, befitting
the honor; of The Lady whom the student body wished to praise.
i;. The Scholastic presented the idea iii the following words: “Notre
Dame is old enough not to be spoiled by valentines. Why. not send
valentines ph some specially appointed day? These tokens of affec-
tion could take many' forms; ; They might' be books for the library,
curios for the museums, pictures for the gallery, flowers for' the altar,
mon?y for one' of a variety of . needs, or even messages from a glad
hand. The value of the gift is.of no concern... No mother loves her
spn less because he ;sends .a carnation,instead..of a car. But mother
and son are brought closer because something has been sent. Besides,
that, bookin-the..library,, that -Innes landscape on the wall, that rose
before [ Our Lady’s statue, won’t merely beautify. Notre Dame. It
will beautify you, restore memories, make a heart beat more quickly
for a cherished instant.” ; V	n -
.If plans for an Almai Mater Day'are in process of formation
publicity surely should be desirable. It is obvious that a great amount
of publicity will be necessary to make the day universally successful ’
- If plans are not being made, it is hoped this editorial may serve as a
.respectful reminder. Notre Dame cannot afford to overlook the idea
of- the Alma Mater Day.
. Running through back numbers
of the colyumn to make sure that
it is being properly and thoroughly
wrecked, we ran into J.- H.’s poem
about the Itty Bitty Duck. We
have had no qualms : about the
colyumn advancing above this. We
have been watching it .too close for
that. And, the .watching of it has
cost us more than one long and
painful letter to appease contribu-
tors who gave really good stuff but
who are not hep to our . wrecking
plan. But we . decided that, we
could do much worse, and tried it.
The result. went, away beyond its
mark and turned out so very punk
that we thought it .was almost too
good to run. However, we have
been persuaded. We have not ti-
tled it. We have run the diction-
ary gamut from horrible to anaes-
thetic and then cross wise to two-
spot and parts . unknown. The
word is still lacking.

What They Say
DECISIVE, DEFEAT.
(The Daily Nebraskan.)
: “They shall . notpass, neither
shall they buck the line: or run the
ends” was the mandate decreed and ’
enforced, yesterday afternoon by
Nebraska’s/ Fighting Cornhuskers
when they met and defeated three
“Invincible” team from Notre
Dame by a 14 to.. 7 score. ?
.... The crowd went mad when
Noble skipped around the right end
for Nebraska’s first score. The
cheering lasted over three minutes
and the air was. filled with pro-
grams and hats and coats.

AT THE LASALLE
“Blood and Sand,”; one of . . the
more recent effusions of Spain’s
leading dime novelist, Vincente
Blasco. Ibanez, is being shown to-
day only at the LaSalle. Ibanez
probably had good intentions—the
play is an arraignment of the bull
lighting tendencies of his country-
men, and the sorry consequences
which follow a career in the arena
—but this opus is not as good as it
might be. The direction is morej
than intelligent; efforts of the di-
rector could have been used on a
more recherrche theme.
. Rudolph Valentino, as the" hero
of the populace, does some of the
best work of his career. One sus-
pects that he had an opportunity
to rehearse the part after his per-
formance in "The Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse” and "The
Sheik.” The supporting cast is well
chosen, and its work is uniformly
excellent. .
Apart from the plot itself, the
picture is worth while. The scenes
are admirable, the continuity is
good, and the director obtained a
unity of impression that is found
in few pictures.
The motion picture version nat-
urally contains many colorful ef-
fects which the stage version, as
performed by Otis Skinner, an actor
than whom there are few better,
lacked.because of the limitations of
the boards. ’■	• '

was also the first game that Ne-
braska has been able to insert sub-
stitutes into the lineup against
Notre Dame. The substitutes had
!the same fire and fight that the
team that . started - the contest
showed. -	'
The playing, of Captain Lewellen
and Dave Noble were the outstand-
ing features of the game. Lew’s
generalship and the manner in
which he. handled' the team were
largely-responsible for' the victory.
His toe made many yards for the
team in exchange of- punts, his
kicks averaging over fifty yards.
Big Dave’s line plowing and end
running never faltered through the
game and it was. he who smashed
through the Notre Dame line in the
second quarter for the first counter
of the game. On an offtackle play

he hit the line and went 20 yards,
leaving a string of attempting tack-
lers lying on the ground. It was
also Noble who jumped up in the
air and speared Rufus Dewitzs’
pass and planted it safely behind
the Notre Dame goal for another
six points. H. Dewitz kicked goal
for another point. .
The Dewitz brothers acted as if
they were celebrating some kind of
an event. Herb had no considera-
tion whatsoever for the visiting line
and his diving power completely
shattered it on almost every play.
Rufus made some nice end runs by
.simply outstepping the wizards
from Notre Dame. ' His defensive
work was remarkable.
Coach Schulte in a statement
after the gamp said, "This is more
evidence of fraternity spirit—foot-
ball spirit plus University of Ne-
braska spirit.”
NEBRASKA WINS.
(Daily Nebraskan.)
After being considered the win-
ners two months before the kick-
off, Notre Dame, once called the
wonder team, fell in the most de-
cisive defeat of its career. The
Cornhuskers, supported by a body
of,students keyed up to the highest
pitch, smashed, tore, and passed
to a clean-cut victory. The game
was an upset, but it was a direct
result of determination to give all
and concede-nothing.'
For two weeks the students have
been drilled into the gospel of
fight and in that time they have , ex-
pressed determination to expand
their supreme efforts in whipping
the highly praised invaders.
For those men who played Ne-
braska has a great measure of
gratitude. Every man played a
game that made the entire United
States give this middle .western
school a glance that marked the
University of Nebraska as a great
institution. Nebraska’s fine sports-
manship and - Nebraska’s fight
against odds was" nothing short of
remarkable and it shall always be
considered a potent factor.
When those hundreds of students
attended the rally Friday night and
when Captain Lewellen and Coach
Dawson, .expressed their opinions of
the game in? no indirect manner,
there seemed to be that declaration
in the air that Nebraska was either
to win or give Notre Dame the
hardest battle 'of ' her career.
- There are hard games ahead,
however. Ames, on the schedule
for next week, has a strong team
that will cause trouble for the vic-
torious Huskers. There must be
no over-confidence. There must be
that same determination-and spirit
to win. When the Thanksgiving
game shall have been played and
Nebraska shall have passed through

STAR AS PROS
Many Former Notre Dame Football
Men Playing on Professional
Teams in Big League.
Cartier field has been the scene
of many a memorable - struggle.
Upon its grassy bosom Notre Dame
has suffered disappointments and
merited glory. Whether the de-
fenders of the Gold and Blue have
gone down to an honorable defeat
or were the heroes of a victory,
whether-they were uninjured or
were carried from the field, the
spectators have always witnessed a
real contest, for, instilled in the
heart of every Notre Dame warrior
is a spirit of true sportsmanship.
Yet with all of this it is doubtful
if Cartier field ever has or ever will
really behold the sight of Irish
meeting Irish in battle.
Yet to those who see the teams
in National Football league play,
such an event is of weekly. occur-
rence. Notre Dame is represented
in practically every team in the
league by one or more men, former
athletes who contributed to the his-
tory of the University.
When "Ojay” Larson, center for
the Milwaukee team, met Paul
"Slip” Madigan, of the Duluth Pro-
fessionals, also playing the pivot
position, last Sunday in Chicago,
spectators witnessed a perform-
ance which is seldom equaled. -In-
cidentally, but unknown to many,
these meh were former teammates
when at Notre Dame, and curious
to note, both were candidates for
the same position. That they
fought with the same spirit char-
acteristic of their play at the Uni-
versity, is evinced by the 6 to 3
score which resulted, and the fact
that field goals only were success-
ful in making the scores.' Irish met

comrade of Mohardt and Anderson.
A tie at 6-all tells the story of the
conflict which followed.
Notre Dame is well represented
in the National Football league by
men who, by their , method of play,
are convincing fans of the benefits
of the Rockne system.
That the “Mohardt to Anderson”
pass made famous by John "Smoky”
Mohardt and Edward "Eddie” An-
derson, continues to be instrumen-
tal in making touchdowns is shown
by the fact that the Chicago Card-
inals, so. fortunate in having the
men, have won every game with
the- exception of the one with the
Canton Bulldogs. - In almost every
instance it is the work of these two
former Notre Dame men that is
responsible for the victories.

Glen "Judge”. Carberry, ex-cap-
tain of Notre Dame’s 1922 foot-
ball team, is playing left end for
the Buffalo All-Americans and
playing it well. It was through his
skill in the game last week, that the
Americans tied the champion Bull-
dogs at 3-all. Needless to say, Car-
berry is still famed for his deadly
tackling.
Notre Dame and the Rockne sys-
tem is represented in the Toledo
Professionals by William "Tillie”
Voss, a member of the 1922 squad
and Michael "Si” Seyfrit, a for-
mer teammate of his. They are
holding down left tackle and right
end respectively.
Others representing the Blue
and Gold mentorship are Lambeau, .
fullback for the Green Bay Pro-
fessionals, running mate of Gipp,
Rydewski, pivot man for the Ham-
mond team and Zois, also a center
with the Cardinals.
These men will be remembered
by the supporters of Notre Dame
as men who have contributed much
to the athletic annals of the Uni-
versity. Due to their efforts Notre
Dame occupies the attention of the
world not only in athletics but in
everything that pertains to the
ideals at their Alma Mater.

joint work of Profs. F. W. Ker-

which the name of Vincent F. Fa-

BUTLER FIGHT
VICTORY HOPE
Butler, Priding Herself on Her
Fighting Qualities, Says She
Can Emulate Nebraska.
“If Nebraska can,, we can!”
“Approximate score: Butler, 10
or 14; Notre Dame, 9 or 0.”
Butler hopes, expects, to defeat
Notre Dame on Saturday. The
Butler Collegian, official student
newspaper of the college, says so.
The newspaper has been making
frequent-boasting reference to the
battle, and a? ir.dceiit - issue com-
ments thus, in its editorial columns:
“If Nebraska "cari . we ^ari! If
fight can smash Notre Dame once
4 fight'can smash them twice! Corn-
huskers certainly can not fight any
harder than Hoosiers and Butler
Hoosiers have never been below
. the state’s man-killing average.
The margin between defeat and
victory at the battle at South Bend
Saturday will depend upon fighting
reserve. Not necessarily a reserve
of- dependable : substitutes, but. a
personal • do-or-die spirit that
• smashes everything before it,
stalks down the field and crashes
through the five-yard hoodoo that
has succeeded in' jinxing the Bull-
dogs so far this year. The team
needs all the infernal noise, all the
school spirit, all the moral support
and all the; grim; determination that
it is possible for the . Butler stu-
dent-body to swing into the cru-
sade that will. bring the state title
to Indianapolis Saturday night.
• The team can' not win by itself.
We have got to back it as it has
never been backed since the new
era of athletic history began, arid
not matter how many find them-
selves at Notre. Daine this week-
end, to bring back what we have
' been striving for for the, last five
years, there has got to be a de-
termined • co-ordination to hurl
every atom of energy back of the
boys smashing towards the Irish
goal!”	.•

HARRIERS BID
FOR THE TITLE
Irish Held Title in State Last Year;
Meet State at Puardue This
Afternoon.
The Notre Dame cross-country
team will make a strong bid for the
state title in the Indiana intercol-
legiate: meet at Purdue this, after-
noon. \	:	'
The Irish harriers copped the
title in a sensational run last year
and bid fair to repeat the perform-
ance again this year; Lead by the
dauntless Paul Kennedy, captain of
the harriers arid the track team, the
Catholic squad will present, a for-
midable outfit in today’s race.,With
Kennedy are two?members of last
year’s title winning team and re-
inforced by such powerful recruits
as Art Bidwell, Jiriimy Keats, . Andy
Conlin and .the veterans Cox. and
Weridland, Coach Meehan’s charges
will have - a_ 2w^
bring\home the crown.
The Irish harriers have made a
remarkable showing in the two
meets that have been run this sea-
son and in. winning both of them,
Captain Kennedy broke the local
course record twice.
The Irish- iniler is running in
great form this year, and will be a
prominent factor in Notre Dame’s
cinder path success this year.
