/. . The first and second.teams rested
yesterday afternoon, while Rockne
put the. remainder., ; of ;the-. squad
■through a light workout that closed
with a short scrimmage against the
■freshmen.	.. : ;
/ Doctor Mercier, made a few short
'comments to classes yesterday on
the Notre Dame-Princeton game and
compared/the strategy. v/ofT/ Kriute
Rockne wih that; of the incb'mpara-
hle Marshal Foch/who directed the
destinies of the allied: armies dur-
ing the. World' War. . . By means of
a diagram on the. board/Mr; Mercier
explained how. Rockne’s principle of
/disrupting the enemy and ; destroy-
ing the co-operation 'between the
units of the opposing forces was
almost identicaLwith that which the
famous commander put .into practice
in the last year of the Great War.
After the game a special car car-
ried the Notre Dame team to New
.York, .where, they set up headquar-
ters at -the/Plaza -hotel; and- went

IRISH VICTORY
IS CELEBRATED
Students Gather at Cartier Bonfire; •
Band Leads Men to Commemo-
ration of TigerTriumph.
“The same spirit that dominated
Notre Dame men 30 to 35 years
ago, dominaes Notre Dame men
now and still wins them games.” So
said Colonel Hoyhes to students and
South Bend people who 'gathered
around the huge bonfire south of
the gymnasium last night. At 7
o’clock, the • students, led by the.
band, started to parade about the
campus in snake-dance formation to
the bonfire, where the “Fighting.
Irish”, were formally welcomed
home from the East after their vic-
tory over Princeton.’ The crowd
encircled the bonfire and gave, yells
under the direction of Cheer-leader
Eddie Luther.
/Colonel Hoynes spoke of athletics
during the old-days at Notre Dame.
He said that he had not witnessed so
magnificerit a demonstration during
his 40 years at Notre Dame. Father
Matthew Walsh followed Colonel
Hoynes on the-platform.-' He told
the story .about the traditional high
silk hat that the, colonel has been
wearing to games since football was
inaugurated at Notre-Dame. Wheri
Colonel Hoynes appears on the field '
wearing his silk hat, it is a sure
sign of victory, asserted Father
Walsh. Colonel Hoynes will wear
this hat at the Georgia Tech game /
Saturday.-
Father Hugh O’Donnell gave a
brief and spirited talk, eulogizing
Coach Rockne;:—He;’ ’characterized-;— -
him.as/being “Notre Dame’s famous
alumnus, the world’s ,/greatest
coach.” When Father O’Donnell '
finished, the students- demanded:
“We -want Rockne.” 'The peerless
coach/ascended the platform. “I’m
riot going to make a speech,” saicT
Rockne, and the crowd roared. r ;
Rockne told bf the hospitality ten- -
dered the team by Old Nassau. He
asked the students to be: “typically
Notre Dame men” when the Golden
Tornadoes come Saturday, and, to.
reciprocate the kindness shown the
Notre Dame .team at Atlanta last
year. '	.
Senator Bob Proctor, of Elkhart,
was introduced by Father, O’Don-
nell. “I think a. lot of-my good
friend Rockne,” he said, “but I was
most found of him Saturday night
when I learned that he had twisted
the Tiger’s tail.” Senator Proctor
was graduated from ‘ Notre/'Dame
19 years ago/ ' .

ers' to: speak. - -Adam " Walsh -said ‘ it, .

THE TRUTH OF HERESY
The Hamlin.'musician’s fascinating tune of’activity is piping the
college student, away from study. J Some morning we may awaken tb
find that all classes have Been suspended indefinitely. Authorities will
- have concluded that there is no longer time for classes in the curriculum
of the'student. One of the necessary' evils of college life will have been
dealt with'summarily. Henceforth^ students will be allowed full free-
dom t6;gambpl out among a million and .two. hectic activities that beckon
to them from the South room of the [Library to Cartier field.; ..:
Class ;dance committees, state ‘clubs,’ publication boards, ;and the
ubiquitous organizations which nowj consume so much time may meet,
or have their pictures, taken,: from morning prayer until! the last rare
tinkle of the steeple clock tells that tliehour of ten is past and/liall
doors are being closed. Enthusiasm, executive ability, and political
boobery may take the stage of play before a; full: house., Mind and
heart may be sunk into the work;of .organization.. : Simultaneously. ;six
hundred and thirteen different clubs, and organizations will, function
smoothly; unhampered by the annoying routine of class work;: Re-
quired credit for graduation vriH. be/given for organizing a’’Roosters’
club, a four o’clock tea, or for piloting some state club to its port of
destination. Honors will be awarded to the man who has proved his
worth by participation in the greatest number of clubs. ;	’
f This is a consummation devoutly to be wished.
: One week of pell-mell participation in activity would be a cure
for organization which exceeds the: limits of common sense. At the end

READING SCHEDULES
■ Schedules are .things that worried:students; devise in order to end'
their worries oyer missed .' class' duties.' Schedules are ephermeral,’ live'
but for a few days, unless a student is ultra-methodical, unless he is
the kind of man who would not dare to take a bath bn Friday. ”	'
But schedules are valuable; they should, to some extent,' be' a
part of every man’s college life. - -	,	.
An army of us have programs [for.reading, programs for reading
volumes , and volumes—tomorrow. But someday, the man who lives in
the land of promise will wake up and find that he has a grudge against
himself. - He will realize that school is the.place, and now is. the.,time
for reading. He will realize that it would be better to read a little
every day, than to-read much tomorrow.	;	•
Time makes habit. The man who. makes ,a reading program for
himself,1 who, we suggest, reads every night after the evening meal,
who reads, just enough while hb smokes, his. cigar or his pipe to last
him until the cigar; is 'extinguished/ or fthe pipe or/two i is burned 'out,'
will find, in .time,jthat>his reading! has become; a, habit. / He will find,
- too, that he has more time; for reading than he thought/. If he is busy,
,so-much the better.. He will not ithen have time for'Brittle Stories,
Blue Professions, Worst’s and the; Red, White arid Blue -Books.
In time he will admit that: r :;1/.// ' ,/?. j;/;!

J .	At the Oliver
i- Alicia de Lille knew all about
men/ and Prince Lubimoff, world-
weary and cynical as Bernstein’s
’Holofernes, hated women. That is
the germ from which “Enemies of
•Women,” the current attraction, at
4he Oliver, is evolved. The story is
Abased upon the novel of the same
bame by Vicente Biased Ibanez
whose “Four Horsemen” created a
sensation some time ago.	'
The play is spoken of as one of
Hhe most' lavish productions ever
j screened, and for this lavishness,
:Joseph.Urban is responsible.. His
conception ’of Lubimoff’s palace,
and the scenes at Monte Carlo mark
:a new era in scenic effects. ,
The cast includes Alma 1 Rubens,
Tedro de,.Cordoba, Mario Majeroni,
; Gareth Hughes/ Gladys Hulette, and
■Willie Collier,’ all of whom are fully
capable of doing their roles justice.
.Towering, above them all, good as
they are, is Lionel Barrymore,, who,
Jin his impersonation of Lubimoff,
/renews his claim to the distinction
-of being America’s foremost actor.
Barrymore ' has been seen as the
misunderstod and outcast hero of
/‘The Copperhead,” as Neri, the
medieval "Italian in : “The Jest,” as
the vacillating- politician- in “The
Claw,”: and now he adds- a new and
different type of his. repertory, and
in doing-so /brings, fresh honors to
himself. '
j When you see “Enemies of Wom-
‘en,” watch Barrymore’s A eyes,': the
most expressive, on the stage today.
■He can convey his meaning better
. with one glance - than can most ac-
tors by running through the whole
category of gestures from entreaty
to vulgar ease.	;
-i«-When ^you-are-in dined . to, rail at
' .the. movies, comfort ydurself with
the reflection that once in a while
an artist appears, whose work is ir-
reproachable, and that after you
have .witnessed .many: banal., vacui-
ties acted by. people who can not
act, a Lionel Barrymore may come
to your rescue, with his refreshing
ability.	:	'

j “Dulcy,”‘the stage success writ-
ten by George ’Kauffman - and Marc
Connolly," has' been - taken -over in

J As Mrs. • Gordon Smith, she is all
that Dulcy need be, that is to say,
if you'will pardon , the expression,
.. dumb. And that is what she is
’ supposed to be.
'■ Dulcy wakes, up to the fact that
• her husband requires her assistance
;; in caring for his business interests,
j Her intentions are' of the best, but
5 somehow she. is never able to do
J J the right thing at.' the righf time.
J What is more,: she has never learned

! “He’s a man! Who’s a man?
I He’s a Notre Dame man! Rockne,
; Rockne, Rockne!’.’ That was the
defiant slogan..thundered at . the
: Princeton rooters yesterday in
i Palmer stadium, by 1,000 frenzied
? Notre Dame adherents,; intoxicated
/ witK the* 'wine'' of victory.- And
Princeton was -forced to admit that
; those jubilant ^.Hoosiers said a
; mouthful. 'That/Rockne was indeed
; the | man ..of; the. hour ’ as well as
something bf a wizard ;in the bar-
gain was conceded, by every one'of
the 30,000 football fans who saw
i the stocky Norwegian’s wonder
team run riot at Princton’s ex-
pense, burying the Tigers under the
humiliating tally of 25 to 2.
- It: was the worst drubbing a
Princton eleven has taken since
1919 when Ira Rodgers and his
West Virginia Mountaineers licked
/the Tigers 25 to 0. Never for a mo-
ment was the result in doubt. In-
deed Notre Dame threw away an-
other touchdown when Crowley
fumbled almost on the Tiger goal
line only to see Crum of Princeton
snatch up the ball^ and dash 75
yards to the threshold of glory.
Trust a Tiger to pick up a loose
ball!	.
. Old Doctor Roper—-professor of
psychology,^went once too often to
/the well. For several years past he
has been hypnotizing his Tiger
troupe into believing itself a collec-
tion of. world beaters. Roper went
Dr. Coue one better. He placarded
the Princeton training quarters with
such stirring legends as these: “A
team that won’t be beat can’t be
.beat!” “Get Notre Dame!”: and
“We are going to win every game
on our' schedule!” ■ That last slo-
gan has an ironic touch to it after
yesterday’s massacre. Perhaps Ro-
per will now have it revised to read:
“We will win every game on our
schedule except those we lose.”
Judging by what , we saw today,
there are other beatings in store
for the jungle cats.
Psychology has its use, but we
rather suspect that two can play-at
that game. Knute Rockne is some-
thing of a psychologist himself.
Knute drilled his own boys in the
belief that nothing could stop them
and he gave them the weapons to
justify that confidence. Princeton
found herself facing what is per-

haps the brainiest, fastest, fighting-
est football outfit throughout the
length and breadth of these United
States. It was a team of. stars, in
which the individual was forgotten
in admiration of the machine. . Such
backs as Miller, Crowley and Lay-
den are among : the shiftiest run-
ners known ; to- the gridiron,. but
each one subordinates himself in
the interest of his team. Tt\isas a
team that this: Notre Dame eleven
will be remembered when the, per-
sonal exploits of its stars are for-
gotten. ..	. ..	.	... ■
. Every man in Rockne’s lineup car-
ried out his assignment to the. let-
ter. Such:interference as .the run-
ner was afforded, such “cleaning
out” of secondary defenders, such
“clipping” of would-be Tiger tack-
lers has never before been seen on
a Princeton gridiron. Notre Dame’s
runners appeared to race behind: a
moving , screen of men 'in blue
agains which barrier the Tigers
hurled hemselves in vain. - It was
interference raised to the nth de-
Jgree—the kind that every coach
dreams about but seldom achieves.
For once Princeton met a. team, with
more brains, more “savvy”, than her
own. She was outmatched • in
speed, in power, in strategy and in
tactical execution of plays. i
[Chicago Herald-Examiner] ’ •
By W. V. MORGENSTERN
In this section of the country, at
least, it was expected that Notre
Dame would beat the Tigers. But
because of the plucky and resource-
ful game that Princeton displayed
against Chicago here a year ago,
there was a belief that the score
would be closer than the final result
proved to be.	,

Parker pens regardless of price. The hew Parker D?Q. ■
—the special pen made for students only—has; in addi-
tion, an extra large ring to link to your note-book, or a ;
