FEW TRICKS IN ANNUAL
SPRING CONTEST.
Thicks that they employed to such
good advantage last season stood
the monogram football men in good
stead yesterday afternoon in their
annuaLgame_iwith_the,recnuits,_and.
as a result they won by a 21 to 0
count. .	.	'
The first quarter was well under
way before Crowley managed to
unleash a neat pass to Harry Stuhl-
drehcr. who romped to the goal line,
thirty yards away. Crowley then
kicked the goal. In the second
quartei* Gene Mayl picked up a
fumble and ran 25 yards for a
touchdown without encpuntqring a
rival. The monogram men' got the
goal when there was interference
with' a man . attempting to catch
a . pass. Eddie Barry grabbed the
last touchdown in the fourth .quar-
ter when he raced' .fifty yards
around right end and Shearer kick-
ed the goal. '

VARSITY DEFEATED
BY STRONGILLINI
HARRY GILL’S GREAT TEAM
WINS ALL BUT ONE FIRST;
OBERST TAKES JAVELIN.,
Harry Gill’s great Illinois track' •
team swept all except one first in its
annual meet with the varsity on
Cartier field . yesterday afternoon
and won by the score of 102 to 24.
In spite of the Illini supremacy and
a strong wind at the backs'of sprin-
ters, only one field record went by
the boards. -	•
Kinsey Wins - High Hurdles
Kinsey of Illinois stepped the t
120-yard high hurdles in 15 seconds
flat, thus shattering a field record,
made by Chet Wynne by 2-5 of a
second.. In the javelin throw,
which was expected to bring out a
record heave? G e n e • Oberst
won at 192 feet, 11 inch- .
made by Milt' /Angier, western :
chairipon. Fred Schildhauer, also of ;
Illinois tossed the spear only a foot ;
less than the winner. This'was ।the -i
only, first recorded , by Notre Dame. ;
The Irish got a. second in the
half mile and in the broad jump and ;
a tie for secorid in the high jump
but in-the other ten events the Illi-
ni romped away with first and sec-
ond places. In the discus throw the '
visitors even took the third place
too.	.	■
Large Crowd Attends.
The meet attracted a crowd of
about 1,500 people, a bit of color
being added to the stands by the
presence, of many girls here for the
annual Junior prom. The meet fol-
lowed ’ the annual spring football
game—betweenzthe-monogram men
and the'recruits; the • monogram
men winning by a score of 21 to 0. ?
The . strong wind blowirig across
the field aided the, sprinters and .
hurdlers, but was a handicap to the
distance runners, as is shown by. the
results. It did not prove as great
a boon to the javelin throwers as'
might, have been expected, however,
and the' three leading contestants,
ranking collegians of the country,
fell below their own previous marks
as well as below;the western con-/
ference record.
Kennedy Unable to W*n-
/There.were few sensational races, .
and the most interesting field everit.
outside of the javelin was .Wright’s-
performance in the high jump. The
Illini jumper, making use of Gill’s
famous roll jump, managed to get
over at 6 feet, 1 3-4 inches, 2 3-4
inches, and 3 3-4 inches only be-,
cause he hit the bar in such a man-
ner that it'bounced, into the air/
The wind Ihen pushed it backk<.
against the uprights and it dropped I
into place, again. ‘	. ;. I
. Capt. Paul Kennedy of the Irish
ran a pretty ‘ face in the mile but
was unable to withstand the sprints;
of McKeever arid Hall. Cox lost the
half iriile to Ponzer after leading al-
most alL the way'. The Illinois ruri- ’
ner had a speedy finish that proved
too iriuch for. even the Cox sprint .’
for the tape. J	■ . ’ -

Flannery’s Essay
Appears in ‘ Truth ’
Harry W. Flannery, instruc-
tor of English in the College
of Science, has written an essay
entitled. ‘.‘Selling Lies and Exag-
gerations,’.’ for the May issue of
“Truth,” widely known Catholic
publication. It is an - attack upon
the sensationalism' of the 'press,
which gives distorted.images of life
as it is not.
In his essay Mr. Flannery points
out how counting room syndicalism
is responsible for the present sensa-
tionalism, for it places money be-
fore morality. The author con-
tinues to say that certain journa-
lists have fixed moral standards;
but these standards are not lived
up to by the whole profession. The
reader, Flannery says, is partly to
blame for the present day litera-
ture for he is the one who accepts
it. Better reading matter will come
when the reader is more particular
in.his selection of literature. Mf.
Flannery concludes that the sole
hope for a better and cleaner press
is the stand which the public should
take against the immoral.
TIPPERARY TERENCE IS'DEAD.
Tipperary Terence was just a..dog." We saw him' presented to
Knute Rockne before .a great crowd. He was\bewildered and looked
' frightened in his blanket of green. It was a big thing, for little Terry
to be; the/center of. so^iich attention. At home in the gym he became
- the. pet of athletes’, and students. No.corner of the campus was closed
• to him. And then Tipperary Terence, in the . way of a puppy, was
hurt at play arid died. We’ll all miss him, even though Tipperary Ter-
• -(-ence was justadog.'..... .	,	<
• The Blackstone boasts of a show
of unusual merit, this week, in “The
Marriage Circle,” a picture which
has received highly complimentary
notices wherever, it has appeared.,
Monte Blue and Florence ; Vidor,
who play the leading parts, do much
to make the picture a success. Janet
Adler’s Syncopators, a * blackface
comedy act by Herbert and Nugent,
arid the Willie Brothers, equilibrists,
complete.the.program. _. /	---
ON THE SUBJECT OF VOTING.
The week beginning today, will afford practically every rnan on the
campus an opportunity to vote. The state .primaries will be held on
Tuesday, while Dome and class elections are scheduled on practically
every day throughout the week.. ;
Every man eligible ?to,ybte ought to.go to the polls,'whether in na-
. - tional 'politics or in campus. politics;, arid exercise his right. . Partici-
pation in .the primaries, national or class, or both, is a necessary thing if
the best.men are. to be chosen for the offices.; x ■ -. ■ /
A primary;is much like the first cut'iri the fooball squad, or the
- i first-tryout in a debating contest. .If good judgment is not used in it a
■man wholly unfitted for the job is likely, to slip in arid when the election
- time rolls/around’in November; or a week later in the case of campus
: elections, it is often a case, of choosing between the lesser of two evils.
Tliat should riot be the case. r
;So' whether, you are interested in national politics, or in. campus
politics, get out and vote this week.. ■ '■•.	,	. < -.
The two principal acts oh, the

What Others Say
A NEW DECALOGUE.
Medicine and surgery, as every
one knows, have made tremendous
strides during the last century, ancT’
the last decade in particular. Who
knows but what it may be only a
matter of a few more years before
an absolute cure for the dreaded
cancer will be discovered? In every '
branch of medicine scientists are
fast nearing the point where they. 1
will have a cure for everything and
anything.
Because these facts are true,
nevertheless, is no reason \Vhy peo-
ple ’should more and more bank on
the devices of science, and mort-
gage their health as they are re-
ported to be doing. Life is speed-
ing up faster and faster, and we are
ever becoming more careless of our
health. ; We go and go and go, night

anything which pleases our palates.
On the ground that “an ounce of
prevention is worth a pound of
cure,” doctors are advocating meth-
ods to prevent illness. . Along with
the doctors comes Miss Maria Leon-
ard, dean of women at. the univer-
sity of Illinois, with a decalogue for
health which seems uncommonly, '
sound. Here it is—\
Eat less, chew more. .	.
Ride less, walk more.
Clothe less, bathe more.
. Worry less, work more.
Idle less, play more. '	~
Talk less, ithink more.
' Go less, sleep more.
Waste less, give more. ,
Scold less, laugh more.
Preach less, practice inore. '
Health at its > best, says Dean
Leonard, means resistance to- dis-
ease, relaxation from mental tension
regularity at all times,, re-cre'atiye
power in work and play, and, a radi-
ance " from life 'abundant.—Daily

Two baseball games with Indiana
and .one with the Michigan Aggies
/rill serve to keep^ Coach George
Keogan’s nine busy during the
vreek.'	■.	.
The first game with the state uni-
versity will be played on Cartier
field' Tuesday afternopn, and the
second at' Bloomington ^on Friday
afternoon. The Michigan. Aggies,
having shown strength by holding
Michigan to a 1 to 0 count, will
come here for a game on Saturday
afternoon.	4
'. While the varsity has already
gained! a victory over the Crimson,
ithe result of its 4 to 1 count in the
seven inning game played at In-
dianapolis last week for* the bene-
fit of the Olympic fund, the down-
state nine is by no means a weak
rival and Capt. Bill Sheehan,, and
his men will have to, be at their
best to maintain their 1 supremacy
over the visitors. /
The ' varsity will be in fighting
• trim this week, no doubt, for the sur-
prise victory by Wabash has had
had its effect. With,Bert Dunne’s
ankle improving so that he will be
able to,travel at his old'form, and
' some intensive stick practice,the
team ( will probably hit its , stride

claring that he is “dead against”
the use of ' college and university

Interhall Leaders in
Danger This Week
When the fourth series of inter-
hall games begins today, Walsh and
Freshman will be the only teams
to take the field with an undefeat-
ed record. Badin, Carroll and
Brownson are close behind and a
loss by the leaders is liable to cost
them the lead.
The Freshman - Brownson ■ tilt
promises to be the outstanding
game’.on this week’s bill.. Both halls
have presented strong teams, and
the result of the contest will have
an important bearing on the stand-
ings. The Sorin-Day game should
also furnish plenty of excitement.
Schedule for the week of: May 4

• ALBION—Following numerous
duckings in the Kalamazoo river by
the Albion college freshmen, when
the sophomores were outnumbered,
the second year men got sweet re-
venge late today when they com-
pletely outclassed the • yearlings in
the flag rush on the campus.
. Led by Ralph Preshaw,. of De-
troit, Victor Peck, of Birmingham,
and Hoyt Howell,, husky .football
men, the sophs bowled over the
freshies and forming a human lad-
der gave the rest of their party a
chance to seize the flag that was
suspended on a wire between two
trees.
Captain Luther Pahl,,of the foot-
ball squad, was referee and shot the
gun within two minutes after hos-
tilities started. Each class was re-
presented by 30 men.
Patriotism consists in the love of
one’s country, willingness to obey
her just laws, and a desire to serve
her when she calls for your aid.
We all esteem and honor a man
who has been a real hero for his
country; we admire the gallantry
of one who willingly dies for her.
This feeling we have is not an ac-
quired one; it is an instinct." This
is one reason why people are shock-
ed and horrified when a man proves
a traitor to his country’s-cause..
.' Catholics; and especially Catholic
schools, have been-accused of such
crimes, for they have been called
unpatriotic. -Perhaps in the century
and a half this, country has been
prospering, there have been some
so-called Catholics who are unpa-
triotic; but, are they ..unfaithful
just because they are Catholics, or
is it because they Kaye been ex-
posed to Catholic religion and have
deliberately thrown• it aside?
If we would but study the Catho-
lic Church and her doctrines we
would find that obedience to all just
laws of our country, and response
to her call, are ideals she holds
up to her children.
. American history reveals that de-
sirable members of the church have
lived up to these ideals; Their mot-
to has ever been “For God arid Our
Country.”—St. Mary’s Chimes.
