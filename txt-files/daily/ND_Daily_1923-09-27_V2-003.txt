ANOTHER YEAR
Impressive Election; Barnhart Meets
No Opposition; Fathe r. O'Donne 11
Talks on Boy Council.
Henry . F.- Barnhart-was re-elect-
ed grand knight of the Notre Dame
council, Knights of Columbus, Tues-
day night in the most impressive
business meeting in the history of
the council. ‘	’
‘ Pleading that he could not hold
the office because of the stress of
his post-graduate work," Barnhart
refused the nomination time and
time again, only .to find'his protests
futile against, the acclamations, of
the council. At one time after a
flat refusal to stand for-the office,
the grand knight insisted upon fur-
ther nominations. For almost five
minutes, the council sat in dogged
silence,, refusing to make any .other
nominations, then burst into an
ovation which caused Barnhart to
break his determined stand and ac-
cede to the wishes of his. brother
knights. . ..	. ’. .	.
All the.-offices except those - of
outside guards were .' filled by a
unanimous ; vote. . Raymond .. Cun-
ningham was chosen to serve as
deputy grand knight; John J. James
as- financial , secretary; : George
Bischoff as chancellor; John P. Hur-
ley as. recording secretary; Mark E.
Nolan • as - advocate; Tom Lieb as
warden; Albert A. Sommer'as in-
side guard-; and Charles Collins and
John , McMullan as outside: guards?

Before .the-.elections Rev. Hugh
D’Donnell delivered a short .talk
with regard to-Notre Dame’s camp
for "the - training? of boy leaders,
which attracted aboutz70 men last
summer.He did .this .in .connec-

VALUES /'/■
/ Notre.Dame has more activities than .the whole republic of Nic-
aragua. A man with considerable initiative, fair, ability and person-
ality/and who is-not timid about dipping his hands in work, by the
time he has galloped over* four years'here can come to be known as a
leader. He will wake up some morning and. find, that he/is .heaped’, with
honors‘"tip -to liis nostrils/ that he is .president of four clubs} chairman
. of;'.three committees, founder of a paper and the business manager of
five organizations; This discovery will not, unnerve him; since his
freshman year, he has perhaps been looking forward to just\such a
deluge. He will now ponder upon the consequences of loading on a
few more honors, and breathing out of his eyes. He will probably
take-the chance/ '	/
/ ' . We have indicated the-pleasure of this gentleman's first awaken-
ing. His second is not as joyous; It comes about in February of his
. senior year, and is accompanied by a feeling of nausea, such as one
experiences just before taking one’s first dive off. a springboard. -. The
honors have by this time' ceased to tickle.the gentleman’s ears/rand are
instead retarding the growth of his hair.; With a great effort he throws
them off, and stands with a puzzled-expression upon his face; We
should be thankful there is even that upon him, for-otherwise he is
naked.	/ 'A
Then suddenly someone ta'ps 'him“upon ^he^iOuldei1; It is his
benignant Alma Mater, smiling and. shoving ar diploma into his. hand.
Gently old Alma Mater speaks: “I- have.done my best. to clothe you
warmly for the blizzards of the world} iny/son. Go 'forth, and/do- not
freeze!” Whereupon/our gentleman is; pushed out of the - door; and
because Jionors have been packed so; tightly about-his-eyes he probably
stumbles on the door-sill: thus- he -makes' his/entry, into^the winds of
the. world. •”	.
- So why allow honors and positions to blind you to the .real-values
of things in college life? Actmties-help-develop-	to a certain
point. Beyond that they demand thht he ’sacrifice,’ very valuable things
—study, reading, recreation, time .for reflection and time for a certain
inimitable, kind of gathering for which Notre Dame is famous. You
came here for an education, for culture, to come in' contact-with that
creature called ..man, and to. study him.' Are you, getting these things
out'df -Notre Dame;life? .	.	-	- •’	-	.
'	N^^^	If you don’t believe-that there:is. truth in this
editorial ask the advice of. some senior-whose name has become a by-
word-—through .his activities./ . - - / ;	'/	• .
-—TESTING LOYALTY -
; -;>< The Daily has begun.- Thanks to the.efforts, of indefatigable
members, of the circulation staff of . the periodical and to the relentless
endeavors of the-Blue Circle, the paper has started on its way in 1928.
But it limps, as it goes}, and cries for the support, of. Notre Dame men,
traditional for .their loyalty./
- Unable to appear 'five days: a -week asUt intended it appears but
^5’. Unable to print a frequent'.issue of eight pages/ it crowds its
message, into four. -	:	.	......z .
-But it goes on.	.	...	.	/
Last spring, we all remember, the students were quizzed as ;to
whether they wanted a daily. ‘Ninety-five per cent of the replies were
xaffirmative, ninety-five per cent, of the, students pledged their support.
To test-sentiment, The Daily was'begun in the last few days of school.
The venture resulted so:favorably that plans were begun for the regu-
lar "publication of the sheet this fall.
And then. :	-	. . " ,
■ In the' first few days of school a comparative few signed the sub-
scription blanks. Despite the efforts of the- Blue Circle, two hundred
eighty; "day students are yet unsigned, and three hundred twenty cam-
pus, men also .are: not subscribers. /	. '	. '	'
. . ..The campaign!is'being.renewed in the halls,and in town. Sopho-
.more'hall- stands at the -head/of-the loyalty list J today.. \E
should ;be one hundred per cent-loyal. . The Daily has confidence that
• cvery/hall will be.so. , - - ' -	- ;	:	"	: .	,
; It .needs the'assistance/of Notre. Dame men, and.it has confidence
. -inthem,.and continues her fight. .Notre.Dame men do hot quit despite
. discouraging pdds.<THE'DAiLY;does< not want to quit.	}
Hi le hi low I got a date.
Hi lee hi up . (Hope) I won’t be
late.
Hi lee the time was set for eight.
Hi up that I don’t get the gate.
—The simple notes of gladness
stole under the door jamb' of the
closed room, careened, drunkenly
against the wall and lit in a quiv-
ering mass at the singer’s feet. It
was Hooda who was singing. He
was getting ready for a date.
The song stopped abruptly. Hoo-
da had discovered that one - of his
socks had a gap in it. Then the
song started again. '.; . Hooda
had decided to wear the red under-
garments: witlwthe feet in them.
Thus did he. deal with his problems.'
He appeared to view resplendent
in his nicest shoes, tie, and room-
mate’s hat. 'He next gave nis hair
a final touch, touched his roommate
rather heavily, and' left.
. Walking rapidly for a number of
blocks he paused to look at the
janitor’s watch. He could just make
it. He turned in at a vine colored
cottage and knocked. . A girl came
to the door. 7 She turned the knob
before, she opened it; .	’
“How do you do,” said Hooda.
“Very well,” "she replied, “And
how do you find yourself?”
“With a looking gl— . I mean
ifine,” said dur. :hero:..^There was a
spell of .silence. Then she .spoke,
“Who .are you and what is it you
want?” .	•	. . :
“Why,’.’ stammered Hooda} “Why,
didn’t we have a date?” -'
“Yes, but why didn’t we,”.-she
replied smilingly. “But it must
have been with my twin sister, and
even so, young man, you should
never call at eight in the morning.”
. He left in a panic. - Nearing his
room he murmured, “I .simply must
remember that.’? , .

From Off Stage
“Luck,” at the Blackstone today,
affords Johnny Hines plenty of op-
portunity to display his sprightly
ability as a comedian. He plays
the part of a rich young man, who,
in a rash moment, bets that he can
make his own living for a year. He
begins by becoming a prize fighter,
and, having accumulated a goodly
number of shekels in this way, grad-
uates into the real estate business,
founds a city, and then, as a grand
finale, gets married. .
' In the supporting cast are Robert
Edeson and Edmund Breese, two
of the most accomplished actors of
the legitimate stage who have gone
into the movies. . Violet Mersereau
plays opposite Johnny Hines, and
Charlie Murray furnishes the
laughs, which, by. hook dr crook, do
not fall to the star’s lot.
As an added attraction at the
Blackstone, the' Guilian Trio will
appear in a selection of classical
and popular songs.—J. S. B.

The cast of “The Silent Part-
ner,” the offering, at the LaSalle, is
headed by Leatrice Joy and Owen
Moore. The story concerns a clerk
who becomes tired of working for
a weekly, salary with no future in
view. He begins to speculate in
stocks, makes a fortune and gains
a foothold in society. His wife,
who believes that their position is
almost too good to be true, demands
that they consider their marriage a
business proposition, and stipulates
that their money is to be divided
equally between ,them. When Co-
burn is ruined by his former em-
ployer, she comes to the rescue, not
in time to retrieve their losses, but
to persuade him k that, as the gentle-
man remarks in “The Spell of the
Yukon,” “Somehow, the gold isn’t
Junior Class Will
Plan for Two Dances
The junior class will hold an im-
portant meeting Friday at 12:30
p.m. in the north room of the Lem-:
monier library, to discuss plans for
the coming year.
Owing to the heavy expenses that
will be incurred during the week of
the prom, the class plans to give
two dances during the year. One
of the dances may be held the night
of the Lombard game, which is on
October 6, and the other will be-
held later in the year. Plans for
the dances will be discussed at the'
meeting.
Other matters will also be dis-
cussed.

ONE reason alone that the Parker
Duofold is invaluable to students
is because fluent writing induces flu-
ent thinking! .You can’t compose your
thoughts if an unruly pen harries your
brain. But Duofold’s balanced swing,
its super-smooth -point, its fit and
business-like feel in your hand, all give
your mind free rein!	.
Ask your, student friends who use
- this classic pen-—they’ll tell you they -
>	would rather let go of seven dollars than
have to part with the faithful Duofold.
Its over-size ink capacity holds a
long-distance ink supply. And its point
■ - - is not only smooth as a polished jewel,
but no style of writing can distort it;.
hence, a pen you can lend without fear.
Students call it the “All-American”
• Pen because it’s the ranking favorite
at leading universities and colleges.
Give yourself a flying start this year
by getting Duofold this week.

IRISH COACH
SPEEDS WORK
Rockmen Meet First Test Saturday;
L Mohardt Out; Livergood
. j i Returns to Squad.
' The Irish football squad went
through a stiff workout of general
football tactics which was followed
:by a short, brisk scrimmage at last
' night’s practice.
Johnny Mohardt, great half-back
on the 1920 and 1921 aggregations,
.was | on-, the field and drilled the
backfield.’, candidates in side-step-
ping:.and blocking incoming ends.
Tom Lieb drove his linemen hard
;/in .charging and blocking and
' drilled -them on the bucking ma-
chine.
Rockne gave his squad of 19
wingmen a special workout against
a freshman formation, laying par-
_ ticular stress on breaking .through*
■" backfield defense to nab the run-
ner before he has had a chance to
. get started. George Vergara , dis-
played some clevei’ work, succeed-
ing several times in" stopping the
freshmen .backs before they had
reached the line of scrimmage.
Saturday’s battle against the Kal-
amazoo outfit , will give the South
'Bend followers of the Rockmen
' some idea of the team that will de-
fend -.the- honor -of -the- Gold - and
Blue' in the big ten-game schedule
that the Irish battlers face this sea-
son.	-
Lombard, ' scheduled to meet
Notre Dame here on the following
• . Saturday, will stack up against the
fast Marquette team, next Saturday;
Berni Livergood, who was out
-with an infected leg, has returned to
the squad. ..
Brownson Holds First
Scrimmage of Interhall
Brownson hall first and second
string, men. played a practice game
on the Brownson campus yesterday.
The Brownsonites, who are the first
Interhall men to get into action,
showed plenty of form and pep in
their first scrimmage.
- Coaches Bergman and Maher of
the Badin hall team issued a call
for candidates Tuesday and were
scheduled to hold first practice last
night. Badin will have practically
the same team as last, year when
they won Interhall football honors.
Over 30 candidates answered the
first call for the Carroll Hall foot-
ball team at a meeting in the rec-
reation room Monday night.
Tom Goss, the coach, will be as-
sisted in rounding up the squad by
“Doc” Connell, varsity-- fullback.
Connell will probably coach the
backfield. New equipment for two
complete teams will arrive soon ac-
cording to Rev. John Devers, Car-
roll Hall'rector.
Although most of the squad are
freshmen, they are not without
some experience and seem confident
of a successful season., A prelim-
inary practice was held this after-
noon, the men* were given a short
workout and instructed in their po-
sitions.
