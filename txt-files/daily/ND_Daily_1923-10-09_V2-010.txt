AT MISSION
FIRST NIGHT
New Holy Communion Record Is
Established at Services
Monday Morning.
'The annual campus students mis-
sion opened Sunday evening at 7:30
in the Church of Our Lady of the
Sacred Heart with a sermon by the
Rev. James W. Donahue, C. S. C.,
/who is conducting the mission. Stu-
dents crowded every corner of the
church and special chairs had to
be placed in the aisles to accom-
modate them. It was the largest
: -crowd that ever attended the open-
ing of a mission at Notre Dame.
- After the student body had sung
a hymn to the. Holy Ghost for the
. mission’s success, Father Donahue
delivered, his sermon, “A - Modern
i Captain of Christ.” It dealt mainly
J with the/life and: Catholic-, faith of
Marshal' Ferdinand ’ Fo ch, former
~ commander-in-chief of the allied
. forces in the World War., As Foch
had won the greatest’ victory of his
career by upholding his faith, we
must win' the greatest battle of our
* lives in like manner, Father Dona?
? hue said. /	- '	■
At the Monday morning exercises
a new record for daily communion
'was established. Father. Donahue
gave an instruction on the. proper
way to receive the Sacrament of
. Penance." Last night in his ser-
mon- entitled , “The? Triumph of
Treason.” Father Donahue, in. his
"7sermon7 pointed'1 out -1^
sin; how mean is man when he dis-
regards the love of God. -Father
Donahue vowed that nothing could
compare with His love..	‘.
The sin of glutoriy, especially
- that of drunkenness, was discussed.
Father Donahue; asked the: students
•to make a pledge to abstain from
> alcoholic, drink. -	’

TO BIG CROWD
Enihusisatic Applause Greets Harp-
ist; Program Accorded Re-
■ ception Unequalled.
Signor Alberto Salvi is an artist
of the first rank. He proved that
decisively last night in his concert
in Washington hall. .	'	-
It is seldom that one has the op-
portunity to hear a harp concert
nowadays. After listening to Salvi,
one laments that fact, for one is im-
pressed throughout the concert
with the indescribable sweetness—
someone has called it a wild sweet-
ness—of the harp. At times it was
saddening; again it was joyous, but
always , was the ■ interpretation so
definite as to attract one to the
varying moods unconsciously. The
harp was shown to. us in a new light
last , night—sfiown to; us as an in-
strument for masterflil, interpreta-
tion arid exquisite beauty.
_ As soon as Salvi had plucked the
first tones from his immense golden
harp, it was evident that there could
be no monotony in his prograin,
even though he. was unassisted by
other artists. Salvi needs no one
to help “put his program over.”
His technique is nothing short of
marvelous and the effects he pro-
duces are beautiful. That his work
was appreciated was evidenced by
the enthusiastic applause—perhaps
the most ever accorded any artist at
Notre Dame—that greeted his every
number.	.	.	'
His program was well-chosen’ and
contained, three of his. own com-'
positions,“Valse de Concert,” “It-
alian Serenade,” and “Scherzo.”
The “Spanish Dance” reminded- one
of soft guitars and gay, whirling
skirts. As encores, he played . “Be-
lieve Me If All These Endearing
Young Charms,” and “Mother Ma-
chree.”	.

in Game; Cadets Play Good
- Game. . .
The Notre Dame Freshmen car-
ried the Irish fight into the Culver
camp and .beat the Cadets, 13-0, at
Culver Saturday’afternoon. ' -r ; .
. Prelli, was the chief ground
gainer for the. yearlings, and scored
the first counter on a hard drive
through tackle and ran 25 yards
through a broken field across the
Cadet goal. -Prelli.hung up,another
tally when he took a trip around the
end for 20 yards.’ ■ :	. . *
T Ruckelshaus and Keefe played an
exceptionally good defense game on
the -"wings, going down fast- under
punts and iriaking some hard
tackles. Canny'was a stonewall at
center on the; defense and smeared
the opposition’s drives through the
line. ’•	- .	.. \	'	.	.
Burt, who made a fine showing
at left tackle, was the real star of
the line, considering that he re-
mairied in line : throughout the en-
tire game, with a.^sprained' ankle
and a wrenched knee. .
Hurlburt was the outstanding
performer of the backfield and his
punting featured the game. Reillys
at the quarter job, displayed re-,
markable field generalship. ' ? •
-Coach Hogan?s men were accord-
ed; a fine reception by the Cadet
school and the Culverits played 'a
fine, clean brand of football.

DAY STUDENTS
Father Finnegan Conducting Mis-
. sion at St. Joeph’s Church
in South Bend.
“We do not know the value-of
life. That. is why we need a mis-
sion,” the Rev. . George Finnegan
told off-campus students, Sunday
night at the mission being con-
ducted “at ' St. ..Joseph’s Church.
“But to make the mission a suc-
cess,” he continued, “sacrifice on
the part of~ all off-campus students
attending the mission will be nec-
essary? . . . . The University of
Notre Dame has the interest of all
off-campus students at heart, spirit-
ually as well as physically and
scholarly.” _	- *
parallels, were; drawn ^byJFathe^
'Finnegan, who/is a former ~army
chaplain, on the sacrifices made by
those. who ;fought in the. World
War, and? those students who are
attending the mission despite'num-
erous handicaps. .He spoke with
pride of the mission made in the
mud of Brittany, where tired but
siricere soldiers went miles to hear
the-words of a chaplain. " ,
“Communion is three-fourths ?of
a mission,” said Father ? Finnegan,
iri his appeal for daily communion
among those attending the -mission.
“The benefits to be derived from
frequent. repetition . are many;
temptations are lessened, .passions
are' dimmed and good inspirations
are manifested.”/	.	■
“The First Mortal' Sin and Its
Results,” was the topic of., discus-
sion last night by Father Finnegan.
The first mortal sin comiriitted by
humanity and the suffering of the
whole humari? race occassioned by
■the act was described in. detail.
Sickness, poverty, weak intelligence
and the weakness of modern times
were described. - All the danger of
mortal’sin, inherited from oiir first
parents, were spoken of by Father
Finnegan in his sermon. .	/

TIME AND THE CHAIR- WARMER
Some gentleman (you may be sure it w?s a modern gentleman)
has said that “Time is money.” The phrase has been popular, because
money is the most popular thing of which we materialists know. Arid
in spite of the phrase’s- popularity, there is truth in it—the way ;n
which to salt down nickels is to spend your time in thinking abour
nickels. That is the code of the business man, and while it is an injuri-
ous code, it is a successful orie. Talk to a business man about some-
thing from which the life has. not been squashed by his pet boa-con-
strictor, the dollar sign—about philosophy, or painting, or the great
literature of the past. .His Reaction will be rather mild, resembling that
of-a plump and solid rock to the breath of flowers. If you are in the
smoking compartment of-a .Pullman, as you are apt to be, you will dp
"better to converse upori; these subjects with the porter, who may also
be money-mad, but scarcely money-made.
*	We have indicated one extreme view of the value of time. In
school we are confronted by the opposite and equally extreme view,
which takes the. stand that the \ clock will- take care of time, so why
^bother our merry heads about it? Of the two ..positions, the business
man’s is the more useful, but ours. the more youthful, and therefore
more refreshing. There is, however, the broad middle path, which we
.	—at least should ’have sense enough. to .follow, .letting the .money-chaser
- hold to his narrow path if he will.
To find the way. to this middle road we should observe at least'one
. fundamental rule—not to waste another man’s time. If we would
v ' squander the momerits of our own brief existence for hours at a time,
. feet poked between the rungs of a chair, our thoughts concerned-with
nothing and our conversation indicating just that—well, that is largely
our own affair.. But when we impose our own stagnation oh another by
burdening his room with our lethargic and unentertaining presence, we
_ have trespassed upon his courtesy and hospitality. Such men have had
to keep their doors locked in order to keep us out, to bealone with their
work and their thoughts. It ought to be that they would 'have to .lock
the door to keep us in.	’
In short, many of-us chair-warmers would help matters all around
by raising the temperature of our own plush cushions now. and then.
SENIOR EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
U Ail innovation in 'class organization is being tried in the senior
class this year. All class activities are centralized in a committee of
15 men, instead of being in the,, hands of many as in the old clumsy
method by which committees were appointed for each and every exig-
ency that arose. \	-	....
In past years it has been found that much dissatisfaction has arisen
from,the fact that there has been very little “system” to class organiza-
tion and government. .This has, of course, been most noticeable in the
senior class. .	.
Under the new order the executive cominittee will draft and sug-
gest plans for the various activities of their class, and-with the ap-
proval of the class as a whole .will conduct these activities. Each man
on the committee has a subcommittee, consisting of three or four, men
of his choice, working with him, all under the-direction of the chair^
man of the committee and the president of the senior class. Every,
mari lias a certain specific duty assigned to him and-he is responsible
for the successful performance of his part of the work. Regular meet-
ings of the committee, in which each member will be required to give a
report of what he and his men are doing, will be a feture of the plan. .
In. this way it is hoped that the senior class program for the year
'can be carried out with the least expenditure of . time: and energy, and
with the maxiinum of efficiency. '	-

Hooda .
(The Play went oxi.)
Hooda settled himself, took out a
-Jck of gum, glued his teeth to-
gether with it to keep from being
too emotional,7 and then as a final-
precaution he slipped off his shoes
and put them in the hat rack under
the seat.
“Where are those papers?” snarl-
ed the villain.
.“Hold on,” said the girl sweet-
ly, “I have no papers, and my name
is not Little Nell. Why should you
ask; me that?”, ,
“It is a' hard ask?” growled the
villain.' “And if you don’t know
why, WHY?”
(It is a lesson in the alphabet,
thought Hooda at'this.point.)
“The spirit of the age does not
permit you to talk like that,” re-
sporided the girl.	,
(She has never seen Division
street ones, thought our hero.)
“Have done with this prattle,”
howled the .villain; “I want those
papers,” ..........--
“You’ll- be getting your walking
papers soon,” she answered^. v
(And. it was right - here that
Hooda ' decided' that ' there was
something wrong with the play.) ■
“I'tell you I shall raise a- ruckus
and play Hades with you if-—”
“You couldn’t raise a nickel and
play bridge with me,” she said.
(Hooda thought that was a. good
one.) _	. .
“You are ipaking a fool of me,”
hissed the villain, “I must find sur-
cease from chagrin.”
“I. don’t believe you know any-
body like that, and T never heard of
the town,” said she with a shrug.
(The play is getting to be a little
more sensible, thought Hooda.’ I
must stay, and see it out.. He set-
tled deeper in the seat) The play

From Off Stage
AT THE THEATERS
bert’s Dogs, - a better act than the
average animal turn, closed the bill.
“Tea With A Kick,” the photo-
play, was not so good as one might
have expected from the variety of
stars which were in.it.
Orpheum—The Cheat.
Palace—William Courtenay.
Oliver—Tell Me Why.
LaSalle—Are You a Failure.

Pola Negri’s latest picture, “The
Cheat,” now playing at the Or-
pheum, is the story of a wealthy
girl who has iparried a poor man
and is forced ' to struggle along
without the luxuries to which she
has been accustomed- The fact
that her f ather has cut her off .with-
out even the customary shilling,
and that a former suitor, apparent-
ly as rich as her husband is poor,
appears at a most critical moment
’ in her husband’s financial career, go
to make up one of the most en-
tertaining pictures in which this
star has appeared. It has . none of
the exotic qualities which character-
ized her former productions, and
attention is paid to the story arid to
the acting, rather than to unusual
scenes, although the setting leaves
1 nothing to be desired.
■ -Jack Holt plays the husband and
Charles de Roche, the imported
shiek, is the former suitor. One
of the many, good features of the
film is that the small parts are filled
’ by such capable men as Charles
Stevenson, Charles Ogle, and Rob-
ert .Schable, whose work is excel-
lent.
William Courtenay, whose last
appearance on _ the stage was in
“Dangerous People,” heads the bill
at the Palace this week in “The
Dragnet,” a five person sketch, de-
nouncing the evils of the drug traf-
fic. The plot is stereotyped, but
its manner of presentation,/ the
presence of Courtenay, and’ of a
-very capable .villain, who was, by
the way,. unprogrammed, saved it
..from what might have been a fail-
ure, and made it a success.,
Joseph Regan, a tenor with a re-
markably good voice, sang-a num-
ber. of) solos which - included-a bit
' : of opera, a variety of Irish num-
; bers, and. the now popular, Mar-
: cheta. ' ■ -

pretense at being able to sing, scor-
ed with his monologue; Fivet and

hibition of roller skating; and Her-

THE EDITOR SAYS.
(Continued from Page 2.)
mg
_ much copy, oftentimes reads
mechanically and ' without noticing
the sense of the story, lets the er-
ror slip by. And now and then the
editor—but he will pass that by for
this time.	■
At any rate: the editor frequent-
ly must write a “Beg Your Par-
don.” THE DAILY has done that
on every occasion when they made
an error of-fact. They are making
every effort to be truthful.
And, now that organization is be-
coming better, they are making
less mistake's.
All of this is really introductory
to what we really intended to say
today.
We want to talk'about the de-
livery of your paper. Due to miss-
ing “S’s,” “C’s,” and “M’s” in the
30-pbint type that THE DAILY
uses for headlines (Hooda is not
the only one worried about missing
letters) many headlines' have to be
re-writteri in the wee-sma’ hours,
when brains are dull and time and
type are , short. And the time be-
comes long, and. the papers late.
But new type has been ordered.
And there have been other rea-
sons for the paper being late—one
of them^was an alarm clock.
When. it is late, the chaps who
make hall deliveries are made rath-

eries as well as they can between

men are also freshmen. They are
in training for the position of cir-
culation manager later. Except for
the possibility of securing that posi-
tion later,' they get nothing for
their efforts. They are aiding you
and Notre Dame; they are ’men
who do things for their school,
things that mean as much as many
activities that pay in glory or cash.
They’ll miss you now and then—r
a few of the less efficient chaps have
missed, more of you than they
should, perhaps—but if they do
miss you, send in your report of
being missed, and keep in mind the
task of the chap who^gets up .early
in the morning to deliver THE

WALSH LOSES
W0WN0SN
Captain Stanhope’s Men Unable to
r Stop Purple Chargers; Corby
_ Forfeits to Badin. ■
Brownson hall, crashing their way
. through the heavy Walsh line and
scoring the lone touchdown of the
opening game of the interhall ser-
; ies, beat the Orange and Black
-squad, 7-2, on Cartier field, Sunday
afternoon. .	-	-
-The game was a see-saw affair un-
„til the middle of the second quarter,
when Brownson, by a succession of
hard drives through tackle arid sev-
eral wide, end runs, carried the ball
dowri to Walsh’s 10-yard line. An-
other wide end run that came from
a criss-crqss7"sent Cooney over the
line for’a touchdown. Brownson
, made” {the try for goal, and the
score; was .7-0. A few minutes later,
..Reidy, Brownsori’s speed king in
the backfield, rushed" the ball down
_ to Walsh’s 7-yard line, but the
whistle for the half interrupted, an-
other score.
Walsh’s- forward defense, with
; the exception of the wings, was
. strong, and Londo, Murray and
Antoirie, repeatedly ' succeeded in
*. stopping the terrific plunging of the
Purple backs.
- Walsh’s secondary defense looked
goodjduetothestellarperforin-
' ance of Bonner arid Ziliack; The
latter proved to .be a vicious tackler,
with plenty of courage. 7 Burton,- at
.quarter-for the Orange and Black,
played a good heady game, as did
- his opponent, Cooney. 'The latter
Starred in the Purple backfield
along with Reidy and Ryan. The
Brownson ball-toters got away for
their runs with plenty of speed and
were clever.at picking .openings.
;Walsh opened up a passing at-
tack in the last quarter in a vain
effort to score ,ahd Magie, who.re-
-■ placed Ziliack- at right half, gave
an exceptionally good account of
himself -for the short time he was
in the game.
Mayer, at right tackle for Brown-
son, was one of the best performers
on the Purple line, and perhaps will
bear out to be the leading tackle
in the interhall ranks. .Of the other
two games scheduled for Sunday,
both Badin and Freshmen hall won
by forfeits.

’until the 18th green, when Adams
sunk a 10-foot putt, and garnered
two points for his team. Joseph

Dan Harris lost to Harry Elmore,
3-0; George Ward lost to F. White-

Analysis of the play show that
the Notre Dame players made bet-
ter scores the second round than
they did the first. - Inexperience in
team play accounted for some of
the losses.
