T. A. DALY GIVES
HUMOROUS TALK
ON “BEING IRISH”
COLUMNIST REVEALS BITS OF
IRISH HUMOR; POUPLARITY
SHOWN BY ATTENDANCE
Tom Daly, Italian and Irish dia-
lect poet, and column writer of the
Philadelphia Public Ledger, gave an
entertaining lecture to an enthus-
iastic audience in Washington hall
last evening. Mr. Daly has.lectured
at Notre Dame many times and the
large crowd that turned out to hear
him last night, in spite of the exams,
is a proof of his popularity.
The topic of the lecture was “The
Fun of Being Irish,” and was pri-
marily a humorous talk, although
several bits of Irish philosophy
were sprinkled throughout. ..
■	Humor There •
Mr. Daly said that no Irishman
' can or tries^to explain Irish .humor,
,bui no one'denies that it is there.
: There are few Irish humorists or
Irish lecturers, and a fewer number
• of them appear on the stage. Those
of the Emerald Isle have received
their reputation for this quality
' ' only from their everyday talk, and
because,'as Mr. Daly stated, “They
don’t need-a diagram to see a joke.”
“An Irishman’s wit is so great,”
said Mr. Daly, “because he mixes
his faith with his humor, his humor
with his faith, and poetry with
both.” ' The Irish plays a great part
■ in Irish wit, and the riew Shamrock
of' - Ireland is Faith; Humor ’ and
Poetry. • '	'	■ .
Puns on Congress
J
with all -sorts7.of jokes which were:
greatly ’ appreciated. He said that
in his opinion, if there had been
more Irish wit in congress, “we
would not now have this ghastly
joke, of prohibition.” The speaker,
however, gave a “Dutchman” the
i credit for composing the cleverest
toast he has ever heard. ’
' The lecturer concluded his talk
by reciting a few poems of his own
composition, among which he read
the ^Italian Cure for the Blues,”
and the “Tide of Loye.” .

Rev. Chas. O’Donnell
Gives Lenten Sermon
The Very Rev. Charles O’Donnell,
C* S. C., provincial, delivered the
sermon last, night in the,' Sacred
Heart church, on “Our Enemy, the
Devil.”	.	-
He discussed the personality of
the devil, emphasizing the many
ways that this individual has of dis-
guising himself. Father O’Donnell
also stated that while the devil, in
tempting people, usually depends on
their sense of sportsmanship, he
himself is in reality the worst of
sports, and will lose no chance to
betray his supposed friends. .
The sermon was followed by the
usual benediction. Father Irving,
C. S. C., vice-president of the uni-
versity, officiated at this service.

held last evening, completed its
plans for a dance to be given in To-
ledo during the Easter holidays. It
was decided to call the dance the
“Bunny Hop,” and all the decora-
tions and program arrangements
are being carried out accordingly.
The dance will be held April 22.
The dance is to be informal, and
invitations will be extended to all
Notre Dame men that happen to be
passing through on that night. -
It was decided not to bring the

Proteges of Carberry
in Sport Limelight
Among the many reports' that
have recently come to Notre Dame
concerning the successful • seasons r
experienced by former Notre Dame
athletic, stars who are now coaching,
there is included the news of the
phenomenal success attained by the
St. Bonaventure college basketball
quintet coached by Glen “Judge”
Carberry, Notre Dame end in 1921-
22 and captain in 1922.	’ :
The St. Bonaventure ' five . got ‘
away to a slow start , the first part
of the season, but under' the care- ?
ful tutelage of Carberry, the team
struck its real stride during the
last lap of the schedule; and .was
hailed by eastern basketball critics
as one of the most formidable col- v
lege quintets in the East. Consid-
ering that “Judge” will have ?four
regulars back next year,' the pros-
pects for a wonder court machine
in 1925 are exceptionally good.' '
The former Notre Dame star-: is
just getting.his baseball squad into
shape and reports that with an
abundance of fair material,he hopes
to-have a high class diamond aggre-
gation. -

To the Editor of the DAILY:
It would be to the interest of
Notre Dame if one of the university
officials would appoint a manager of
the university band. That the band
is. able to advertise Notre Dame as
well as the athletic teams do was
very admirably illustrated by the
Pittsburgh trip last fall when the
band accompanied the student body
to witness the game between Notre
Dame and Carnegie Tech.
At the present time the members
of the. band “turn out” well for re-
hearsals during football season be-
cause there is an incentive—the
work of playing at the football
games and the one trip with the
student body during the football
season. ■ But after ' Thanksgiving,
the records show a decrease in at-
tendance. And why should the
members be expected to report
faithfully for practice? There are
no concerts or trips to act as an
inducement until the succeeding
football season. Would the foot-
ball players drill as regularly and
earnestly as they do if “Rock”
didn’t have any games scheduled?
I think not.	’..... .
If an active faculty member were
appointed to book a concert in some
nearby place every two weeks, oc-
casionally a week-end trip, and a
spring concert tour of several days,
the school would be getting a great
deal of publicity. This alluring
schedule would fill the. band room
at every rehearsal. The band
would improve in size as well as
quality, thereby increasing its
power to advertise Notre Dame. In
this manner an active faculty-man-
ger of the Notre Dame band would
be . a valuable asset to the univer-
sity.—F. J. M.	.	'

FOR MEET WITH NOTRE
DAME SATURDAY
Barring the advent of all unde-
sirable weather the Notre Dame
track team will make its initial ap-
pearance of the. outdoor season
when the Blue and Gold invade
Greencastle for a dual meet with
DePauw Saturday afternoon.
The meet should serve .as a good
seasoner for the Irish track squad
which is beginning, one of the best
outdoor track cards the school has
ever had. The home events will be
particularly attractive more for
their quality than their quaritity.
The Illinois meet will create an in-
tense interest throughout the mid-
dle west. The state meet will be of
as much importance to Notre Dame
a sthe western conference meet.is
to the Big Ten members. The title
has rested with the -Irish for nine,
years and Coach Rockne is particu-
larly anxious that the Blue and
Gold should top the scoring column
again this year.
The DePauw tracksters have been
in constant training for the past
few weeks for the Notre Dame
meet, and although the condition of
the weather has forced the men to
confine their efforts to the gym for
the greater part of the time, the
coach of the Greencastle squad
hopes that his proteges will be able
to make a good showing against the
visitors. Outdoor work has also
been slowed up at DePauw because
of the condition of the track. Try-
outs were held this week for the
Notre Dame meet and the down-
state track critics expressed them-
selves as being more than pleased
with the showing made by the men,
considering-the muddy condition of
the trackT "Several of 'the -veterans
from.last year who are practically
assured of a place on the team were
unable to report for the tryouts,
but several new men competed and
gave creditable performances. The
unfavorable' condition of the field
prevented Paul Jones from working
out in the high jump and pole vault.
After the dopsters had predicted
a victory for Illinois in the dual
track meet with California on April
19, the sudden appearance of in-
juries to combine with the already
unfavorable weather have done
much to dampen the enthusiasm
‘which has attended the practice
sessions for the past few weeks.
Seth Hughes,, star 220-yard dash
man, is confined to the hospital and
will be lost to the team for the
California meet, and in all prob-
ability for the' Drake relays, where
he will be badly needed on
sprint teams. With Kyle, the
ored sprinter already in the
the
col-
in-
jured list, Bob Ayres pulled a ten-
don and will also be out of compe-
tition for some time. Both Brown-
well and Angier have been suffering
from minor ailments. The loss of
Ayres, Kyle and Hughes will handi-
cap the Illinois relay team at Drake
where the Suckers set an American
and a world’s record last year.
MAJORS BREAK CAMP
The Boston Red Sox, after
ten
weeks’ training in San Antonio,
broke camp and started north this
week. The St. . Louis American
League team also quit their winter
quarters at Mobile. ’
TIGERS TRAIN FOR RELAYS
Coach Fitzpatrick, Princeton, with
a squad of 170 trackmen out

his star performers for the Penn re-

FOR SPRING TRIP
BASEBALL SQUAD SHOULD
DEVELOP FAST WITH
OUTDOOR WORK
The proximity of the date which
marks the beginning of the southern
jaunt for the Notre Dame baseball
team has served to speed up prep-
arations for the trip and Coach
Keogan is making use of every
chance to get in a session of. out-
door practice. .The outfielders in
particular will benefit from the out-
door work and. the coach will also
be able to get a better idea of the
caliber of the candidates trying out
for the garden positions.
The change from the gym to field
will also be a benefit to the batteries
as well as to the fielders. The can-
didates for mound duty on the Irish
1924 varsity will be able to develop
faster under the * improved candi-
tions and they will have greater op-
portunity to get into form pitching
to batters.
Last night’s practice session was
featured with a pick-up game.

vided the mound duty on each side
with two Frosh twirlers. Each

On the Level
We often wonder how much
scorn do the “old timers” evince
when they attend a game of the
so-called modern football. The
question was brought to our atten-
tion with particular emphasis by
reading the history of football
St. Louis university.
During the first five years
the sport there the school had
at
of
to
content itself with the ice-cold
aloofness of the faculty refusing to
support it, because it was too bru-
tal. In those days, so the account
says, the newspapers would invar-
ibly print the list of injured first,
then the result and the account of
the game would follow later. Sev-
eral games were stopped in differ-
ent cities by the police. With only
three downs to gain five yards, the
flying and shifting wedge were used
and we : can almost picture the
trainer starting on to the field as
soon as the ball was snapped.
Coach Rockne’s football products
who are now connected with the
coaching business are being sub-
jected to the same fate as their il-
lustrious teacher. Eddie Anderson,
captain in 1921; Joe Brandy, stel-
lar quarterback in 1920, and Harry
Mehre, center in 1921, are being

hounded by tempting offers from
other schools, and it is reported
that Eddie Anderson has resigned
from Columbia college, Iowa, to ac-
cept an offer elsewhere. Brandy
has departed from St. Thomas col-
lege and signed at Ripon, while
Harry Mehre is reported to have ex-
tended his services to the Univer-
sity of Georgia, where Frank
Thomas, quarter, back in 1921, act-
ed as assistant coach last fall.
When we were kids, we liked to
break windows, but now we enjoy
seeing them mutilated by others,
especially some of the candidates
for the varsity baseball nine.
When the diamond performers
took their first workout on the sod
the other afternoon, we took pleas-
ure in counting the prospective
