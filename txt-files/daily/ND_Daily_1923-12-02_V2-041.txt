: Thomas Hodgson, president of the
Notre Dame Glee club, announced
yesterday that the organization will
appear- in its first concert of the
year. December 12, in: Mishawaka’.
The entertainment will be given un-
der.the auspices of the Junior class
of Mishawaka high school. Two
local artists, Miss Josephine Decker,

way, pianist, will assist ,the club in
the presentation of a colorful pro-
gram. Dr. J. Lewis Browne will di-
rect this initial- concert; ■
: This: year’s. Glee club program
differs radically from those offered
by former clubs. Several difficult .
numbers are to be presented, one
of which is Brahm’s “Rhapsodie”
in ;which Miss Decker assists the
club. As :a feature, providing an
abundance of fun, the nursery
rhyme, “Old King Cole,” will be of-
fered.. | To. help, diversify the pro- ,
gram, Harry.,Denny’s Oliver Hotel
orchestra, composed wholly of . Glee
club members, will be carried with
the club.,....................... .
Miss Decker will sing three con-’
tralto ■ songs. Her voice displays .
well her finished artistry. Mrs. Gal- . '
loway has chosen several numbers
by Godowsky and Rubinstein for
her part of the program. She en-
joys an enviable reputation in musi- -
cal' circles/of this vicinity.	'
■ The. dub will present one of Dr.
Brownd's’/ownLcomp^	-
time,” a melody of love.' . Dr. •
Browne’s reputation as a composer
arid now ' as a ' director is widely
known. '	' .	.

bers and in the absence of Dr.
Browne is directed by Joseph Casa-
santa, B. M., ’23, assistant director •
of the club.	.

THE COLLEGE MAN’S LANGUAGE
The column in a Chicago newspaper has as one of its bits of
humor a short and pithy illustration showing that the speech of college
■graduates was not always as per-second commandment. One of the
conversations cited was that of a. Notre Dame graduate and a Princeton
man. Most of their talk was presented with something like this:
! te!?(*”) ? !! *”!	-
In fairness it must.be admitted that the rest of the column was good.
In the same spirit of fairness it must be admitted that it sandpapers
one’s soft spots to see the word Notre Dame linked with language of
this kind. And the irritation is more aggravated by the knowledge that
Notre Daine ranks with the foremost in matters of clean ethics and
cleail mindedness. Because one man (or ten men for that matter) is
brain-lazy enough to “spice” his conversation with obscenities is no
excuse for placing so lofty a name alongside the dubious figure-gym-
nastics shown above. It is bad taste. Princeton or any of the other
colleges that were mentioned in the column would feel much the same as
we do about it if it were brought to their notice.
It is very hard to find a path of life on which the man who swears
does not walk. But we believe that fewer of him are turned out from
colleges than from any place else. . And likewise we believe that at
Notre Dame the number of the swearing legion; is comparatively!
small. : Theibit! of JiumorJiad a sting,: because it was\bad taste,* and jt^
~Was~untrue. " \	-
ARTFUL BRISBANE
Mr. Hearst’s famous columnist must have been recently called to
task for some of his .wild speculations by an annoying professor. At
least it is difficult to explain otherwise the column of criticism which
j that writer directs against colleges in the November 24th issue of the
Chicago Herald and Examiner.
' After an intended clever and ironical thrust at the college football
players in the beginning, Mr. Brisbane shifts his attack to the evil in-
fluence of colleges in general in the statement that:
‘‘It takes a .boy of strong mind to endure several years of false
standing, false glory, false importance, false fossilized theories, and
then come out fit for life’s real work.”
He next.makes the startling assumption that:
‘Had Lincoln gone to college you would never have heard of him.”
Contrary to the existing belief, therefore, Lincoln must not have
been gifted, with a “strong mind.” It is hard to imagine what a great
man Woodrow Wilson might be if he had not been hindered.by his col-
7 lege training.	.	,
. . Mr. ^Brisbane next resurrects the dusty examples of men who have
attained prominence with little schooling. Yet to place a few of these'
most successful graduates of experience, as Brisbane might call them,
beside the ordinary graduate of college is obviously no just comparison.
As a matter'of fact the.college graduate who fails to make good becomes
conspicuous because people believe he has had greater opportunity.
But if a college training is to be regarded as a handicap, surely these
men have been judged too harshly; ;	/
There is of course, an implication that. Mr. Brisbane’s diatribe
against colleges was intended merely to console the. grieving parents
who cannot send their children to college or to encourage the youth
who cannot continue his education. But evidently the influence it may
have-upon prospective college students who have the .means,and some
desire to obtain- more learning is .not considered .by'.the writer. It
would seem hardly fair to destroy one man’s reputation merely, to soothe
another’s. • -	■	.	.

Editor of NOTRE DAME DAILY:
The sophomore who takes it up-
on himself to criticize seniors for
not carrying the canes they voted
to carry, may quickly discover, that
canes can be used for other than
walking purposes. But on second
thought such violence seems ill-ad-
vised, for the noise created' by a
baby when he'is spanked is more
disagreeble than his impertinence.
And anyway,, the lad will grow
up some day.' Perhaps then he, too,
will answer some young imp’s ques-
tion,. “Why aren’t you .carrying
canes,’ senior?”, with the tolerant
reply, “To make little boys like you
ask questions.”

Editor of NOTRE DAME DAILY::
It seems pitiful that any; little
“Soph” should become so interested
in a thing that regards people who
are so far removed from his state
in life. He may be a senior some
day but it looks "as though the’
works are probably set against him.
At any rate, . as he struggles
along, let him forget ;the seniors
and their relation to their canes.
Let him worry more about the
things his mama and papa ■ sent
him here to worry about. Let him
delve deeply. if he wishes, into
problems more suitable to. the ex-
tent of his days. Even if he never
gets a satisfactory answer to his
queries regarding the seniors and
their canes, he may still fret his lit-
tle frets and no one will mind.

I AT THE THEATRES.
Oliver—“The Covered Wagon.”
Palace—“Joveddah De Rajah.”
Orpheum—“A Man of Might.”
LaSalle:—“The Gold Digger.”
Blackstone—“Men in the Raw.”
’ James Cruze fooled the movie-
going crowds when he produced
“The Covered Wagon.” Instead of
the epic movie of the ads, which al-
ways makes us cautious and four
bits richer, he-has produced a great
motion: picture and an enjoyable
three hours. He has idealized our
boyhood favorite—an assortment of
pioneers, perils, Indians, and res-
cuing troopers added to a simple
plot. The plot preserving the three
dramatic unities of an ante-bellum
movie: a dark-complexioned villain,
. a fair-haired heroine and - a hero
whose features exude heroism.
Our interest in the plot alway be-
gan and ended with a study of the
stance employed in the final fade-
out.
But Cruze had some money left
over after he had - bought the
wagons and so he hired a man
named Torrence — Ernest Tor-
'rence. It was really too bad that
he hired this man afterwards, be-
cause when Torrence gets through
i acting you really wonder why Mr.
Cruze bought so many wagons, and
if he couldn’t have got along with-
out Lois Wilson, and have let some-
one else revive Kerrigan. In. fact,
Torrence should have played every
part except those taken by the
horses and the other scout.
The picture is filled with an ar-
tistic use. of big scenes. Simplicity
and exactness, in spite of the mon-
ey spent, are the effects so admir-
ably striven for, and obtained, by
, James Cruze. Emerson Hough had
given him a prairie fire, a buffalo
hunt, an Indian attack, and a river
crossing scene, in which the long
- ' train Jof covered wagons ford the
deepj broad waters;.of the Platte;
but-if Hough described them, as well
as Cruze depicted them, then I am

policeman can tell you is that-you’re
not supposed to put your flivver in

potent influence for good officers’ of

they could tell the casual passerby
that jelly-fish are not used as a but-

What They Say
By WILLIAM W. ROPER i
Coach Princeton Football Eleven.
(Continued from Yesterday.)
A quick opening play equally as
good is directed just inside of the
defensive tackle with the offensive
end and tackle cross charging on
the defensive guard, and tackle re-:
spectively. This play is used from
the first position of the backfield
without a shift. '	'
■ ' A Play Without'a Signal.”
Stuhdreher, the Notre Dame quar-
terback, has a very clever fashion
of taking the ball from center with-
out a signal and driving ahead for
a couple of yards. A play without
a “signaF is ‘ practically-certain to
get the offensive line standing up.
This is used with particular effect
down near the goal line. '
If Notre Dame has any weakness
at'all I would say it is in the pro-
tection afforded the kicker and the
speed with which the kicks are got-
ten off.
The record of the team, to date
has been remarkable.. The players
and the coach are a fine crowd of
sportsmen. It was a great pleas-
ure to see them at Princeton this
fall, even though we were over-
whelmingly defeated. ’ I hope we
will see them back next year.
■ In a team like Notre Dame it
is difficult to select the outstand-
ing figures. Rockne developed a
perfect machine, and such a ma-
chine, is successful, in a great meas-
ure,- because personalities are sub-
ordinate to a.great extent. Against
Princeton his first string backs—
Miller, Layden, Crowley and Stuhl-
dreher—proved sensational in all
aspects of the game, but. when
Rockne sent second string backs
into the game the westerner’s back-
field lost little of its cunning.
. A Heady Quarterback. :
Stuhldreher, I will say, is one of
the headiest quarterbacks I ever
have seen. He ran his plays against
us with almost faultless judgment.
His series of selections is. uncanny.
In addition he is a brilliant runner.
Layden is a marvelous fullback.
He runs lines and ends With dash
and judgment, and . is a hard man
to stop in the open field. Crowley,
also, is a brilliant open-field run-
ner,, with an uncanny knack of ; mak-
ing tacklers- throw themselves off
balance and then of whirling away

in another direction and out of
danger. >
The line, too, is outstanding. The
particular star who struck my fancy
.was Oberst, a 203-pound tackle,
who was a vital factor in all of the
offensive efforts of the western
eleven. Oberst is fleet for a big
man, and is equally strong on the
offense . and defense. He opens
huge holes in direct line plays, flies
out to the end on swinging plays,
and generally plays hob with the
^defense. Down field • he is' fast as
the end. .	. r . .
Naming players ‘ -with : Notre
Dame,, as I said, is difficult. I be-
lieve Rockne could send in a steady
stream , of players until he had a
new eleven and still not. greatly
cripple its offensive powers..
;• It’s a wonderful eleven.

TRACK SEASON
years been the weak point of the
Irish track team, since the.quartets
have been, bolstered . by only . one
consistent runner. • This . year,
Rockne will have Kennedy, Cox,
Conlin and Wendland. With the ex-
ception of Wendland, who has spe-
cialized in the two mile and whose
speed and form' have improved
greatly during the harrier season,
the other three men can readily
adapt themselves to a mile or half-
mile fun.
Rockne has two other promising
half milers in Barber and Bidwell.
Barber has already won his letter
in. this , event, and Bidwell starred
in the .distance runs on last season’s
Frosh, squad.
In the dashes, the Irish sprint
team will be well fortified by Lay-
den, Barr, and Crowe, the latter
being a recruit from the Freshman
team of last year. Layden and
Barr performed in brilliant style in
the 100 and 220 dashes, having
completed the season consistently,
holding to the fast time of 10 and
22 seconds. Layden won the 100
at the Aggie meet in a little faster
tran 10 seconds.
. The low hurdled events will be
minus the work of the champion
Gus Desch, who gained - national
prominence in 1920 and' 1921 by
his sensational, work. His consis-
tent winning streak that lasted for
two years was slowed up a great
■ Candidates Report; Grad’s Places
Must Be Filled; Material
Promising..
' With the meeting last week of all
prospective track candidates, Coach
Knute K. Rockne began prepara-
tions for what appears, to be one of
the most successful track seasons
f ever recorded at. Notre Dame. Last
year the Irish tracksters met with
varying success in their big meets
with Yale, M. A. C., Illinois, and
’at the Drake relays, and concluded
the season by winning the state title
at the Purdue meet, and placing
. tfifth in the western conference
; meet at Ann Arbor.
Considering the brilliant showing
'made by the distance. runners in
the cross-country work this fall
which closed "with the retaining of
'• - the state harrier title won in 1922;
.Rockne will be assured of some
very good, material for the mile and
two mile runs. .'Captain Kennedy,
leader’ of the Irish track squad. is
expected to finish his last year of
. . intercollegiate competition as one
of the fastest milers' in college
ranks; Kennedy is a 4:25 miler,
and judging by the form he has
• shown in the cross-country _ runs,
the Notre Dame track fans can ex-
. pect to see the Irish star better his
' time to a considerable extent.’ JKeri-
' nedy will long be remembered in
Notre Dame athletic-history, by-his
■ courageous; run at" the' conference
i meet last June when his running
shoe was torn from his foot and he
‘ continued in the race for half a
mile till he was forced, from the
/track by the intense pain" df his
cinder-torn foot.	* .
For the Illinois and Drake relays
this season, Notre Dame will be able
..to present a formidable two mile
team or possibly a four mile team to
compete with the distant quartets
from other middle western schools.
