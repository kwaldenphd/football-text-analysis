Thrill upon thrill! ! Each day
my mail brings new delights; For *
I have received the second letter '
from “Sis,” of Chicago. Some of ,
the gray-beard readers of the col- :
umn may remember as far back as :
January 24, when I . gave you a
part- of her first - letter—it was ,
written on blue stationery with red
jn]c__arid how. I mentioned that it
was the first time in years I had
been called “dear.” . ■
._____-o- -o- -
And today, on flaming rose-col-
ored paper, I" find these words writ-
ten in white ink. (comme il faut):
, “Very poor bn dates.
“Dear Mr. By-paths,

Class in Astronomy
; Added to Curriculum
Father DeWolf, ardent astron-
omer of the University,, has decided
at last to initiate others than the
civil engineers into the mysteries
ofi star-gazing. Accordingly, he
has started what is claimed to be
i Notre Dame’s first course in col-
■legiate astronomy. The course
; started with this semester and is
J open; to upper-classmen from any
college on the campus; Twenty-six
students are taking advantage . of
■his invitation and have joined the
; class. They represent every col-
lege on the campus except Law.
The fact that a high school knowl-
edge of mathematics is essential
may explain the failure of any law
students to sign up.
The class may take up a general
study of the ancient and modern
theories regarding astronomy at
first. The rigidity of the earth,
the tides and seasons will be a
few of the things discussed. Each
planet in. turn will be studied, and
the solar system of each.
Father De Wolf stated that there
are still a few openings in the class.
Any student possessing the require-
ments ; already mentioned is eligi-
ble to the class.. Come early and
get a . seat.
Miss Shaw Augments
N. D. Admirerers
Ari important addition'was re-
cently made to the thousands of
feminine admirers in the country
of the Notre Dame football team,
in the person of Miss Mary Joan
Shaw, a two days old daughter of
“Buck”; Shaw, former member of
the Fighting'Irish, who won nation-
al' fame while at the University.
Miss Shaw is a resident of Reno,
Nev., where, her. father is the head
football'coach bf the University of
Nevada, “Buck” has established
;several notable records since be-
: coming the Director of Athletics at
: that institution. . The brilliant per-
formance of the Nevada team in
’ holding the University of California
; to a '0-0 tie last fall was perhaps
the climax of the season for Sha.w’s
pupils.

Landscape Gardener
Removes Doubts
Students who think that the
trees of Notre Dame are being de-
stroyed .are not justified in their
beliefs. Brother Ferdinand, who
recently' rjeplaced Brother Phillip
as landscape gardner, has a plan
of complete renovation for the
campus beautiful; Under this plan
certain trees which are too close
together are being removed to . dif-
fer ent, locations to afford room for
development and growth. When
the trees are. further apart, they
widen at the trunk and grow to
full strength and glory; whereas,
if permitted to grow closely the-
trees would - grow straight up and
their strength and balance would
be impaired. Some of the bushes
are also being moved for the same
reason. Those trees, which have
been cut down, have been. done, at
the orders of the landscape gard-
ener.	_ .	•'
Brother Ferdinand is a graduate
of the Illinois School of Landscape
Gardening, andhis knowledge of
this work is very keen. The slight
marring, of the beauty of the cam-
pus . is merely temporary,—being
sacrificed for permanent improve-
ment. - ■ ;	.
fore an audience that taxed the
capacity of the old tank house in
the rear of ■ the Administration
building.
The primary purpose of the meet
was to establish the first pool rec-
ords of the Notre Dame tank made
by students. In the tests several
high marks were registered by
members of the varsity squad.
Mike Anderburg is credited with
the best record of Friday’s per-
formances, establishing a mark of
2:56 3-5 in the 220-yard free-style
race. ; Dick Fuite, in the 40-yard
back-stroke and “Jerry” Rhodes in
the 40-yard breast-stroke showed
considerable improvement . over
.past^records,^^
Baiers, Alvarez, Terhune and. Car-
ey was found a quartet of fast
tankmen, making the 160 yard re-
lay in the fast time of 1:25 5-10.
Rafael Alvarez, an' electrical en-
gineering student from the Philip-
pines, staged a trick and fancy
swimming exhibition that may rival
some of Houdini’s famous, water
tricks. Among other performances
he swam the length of the pool
with his hands and feet tied behind
his body. He also won first in the
century dash free-style with a mark
of 1:04.	;	,
The present records for the
Notre Dame tank are only tenta-
tive and are not expected to stand
for more than a few days. As soon
as possible, members of the swim-
ming team will attempt to lower
the existing marks. All students
who desire to . join in the attempt
to break these records should see
the swimming coach to arrange for
a time and official timers.
_ The following is a complete sum-
mary of the meet:
40-yard free-style: 1st, Weibel;

FAST TIME
MARKS MEET
Gold Team Wins Meet; Barr and
McTlernan Tie Gym Records;
Novices Show Well.
Two gym records were. equalled
and some exceptionally fast time
registered as the Gold team won
the annual Blue and' Gold meet,
57 1-2 to 52 1-2, run off in the local
gym yesterday afternoon.
Barr winning the finals in the
40-yard dash, breasted the tap in
:04 2-5, tying the gym record set
in 1910- by Watson of Notre Dame.
Elmer Layden flashed over in sec-
ond place barely a few inches be-
hind the speeding Barr.
McTiernan, the Irish quarter-
mile ace, copped the 440-yard run
in :52 1-5, tying the record set by
Devine of Notre Dame in 1911. Mc-
Tiernan ran a beautiful race, set-
ting a terrific pace for the field of
starters. Bud Barr came back in
the 440-yard dash for a second
place.
The mile and two mile runs were
the other feature performances of
the afternoon. Captain Paul Ken-
nedy followed an exceptionally, fast
pace set by Judge, the Frosh flyer,
who took .the pole position and
rounded out the half-way . mark in
2:11. The pace slowed up a little -2
and the aggressive. Kennedy, vet-
eran of three years’ service, on the
Irish cinder paths, gradually drew
up on Judge and passed him at the
three-quarters mark in a terrific
burst of speed. Kennedy’s finish
was a “thing of joy.” The. flying
Irishman turned the last quarter
in record time and flashed home a:
winner_in .4:28 4-5.-	.	’	:~
The two mile was one of the fast- -
est distance grinds-.turned in by an
Irish runner in a long time. John-
ny Wendland trailing the field for
the early part of the race, gradual-
ly drawing into the lead near the
mile mark and held his position till
the finish. Wendland made a bril-
liant finish-and looked fresh and
strong as he opened up a burst of
speed on the last lap and crossed
the finish at 10:00 4-5. Cooper,
who finished strong in second place,
trailed in fourth place from the
start of the grind up until about
the 14th lap. The diminutive step-
per pulled up on Wendland and
kept pace with the leader until the
last two laps.
The 40-yard low hurdles uncov-
ered a new timber topper in the
yearling ranks when Barron broke
the tape in :05 2-5. Casey of-the
varsity , ran a close second, after
having won the high hurdles in
:05 4-5. Adam Walsh and Johnny
Johnson did not . enter the meet.
: The novice runs were featured
by the spectacular finish of Joe

It is said that philosophy is the
science of making distinctions. This
naturally tapers down to that other
conception of it, that is, the science
or art of making definitions. 'What-
ever may be said of the adequate-
ness of these notions of philosophy,
it seems to be as necessary for men
to formulate definitions as it is for
them to possess a philosophy of life.
Their philosophy may. be superficial
and their definitions erroneous, but
one often finds considerable wis-
dom in the most ridiculous of defi-
nitions. Thus the man who said
:that “play is the work we do that
isn’t compulsory,” though he said
it in jest, struck deep into the phi-
losophy of education, and the psy-
chology of work.

'	THE HILL STREET CAR
“Not all the men at Notre Dame are Notre Dame men!”
It is just'a short observation made by one who is a frequent pas-
senger on the Hill Street car, yet who has been so closely associated
with Notre Dame for years that he understands the requisites for a
“Notre Dame” man.”
What are his conclusions based on ? The mad scramble at Michigan
and Washington streets to be first into the car, in which, somebody’s
mother or sister is shoved roughly aside? The loud and profane talk
that indicates an attitude of complete ownership to the exclusion of
the comfort of other passengers? The amusing efforts of a freshman
to do a “turn over” between the iron posts on the rear platform ?
Yes, all of. these and more. Chiefly, in all probability, an incident of
the particular day on which the comment was made. Three boisterous
students were sitting on one side of the car loudly commenting on two
young women cheaply but gaudily dressed, and much be-rouged. .As
. the girls rose to leave the car a distinct flirtation with a view to	accom-
_	panying them on the part of the students was noticed. The girls	turned,
j	and with the deliberateness of their type, paused long enough to	clearly
;	turn up their noses. Scorned! If only that had made them ashamed, but
i	it did not, arid the three “college men” made complete their disgrace
j-	by insulting the. girls.
It. is rioticeable that smoking on the car has lessened, which is a
most cominendable improvement. The Hill Street car connects the
University with South Bend and the world. Let us not merely be,men
from Notre Dame on that car. Let us be Notre Dame men—courteous
and gentlemanly to all. ■	.
THAT DEAR OLD LADY
“Notre Dame was the last victim.
“She was due for a good drubbing, but Lady Luck smiled on her
and let her. off with a 20-21 defeat.”
i	’	—The Indiana Daily Student.
5	That was very kind of Lady Luck. It. is certainly too bad that
? - the Lady’has. not reciprocated in the autumns in which Notre Dame
!	and Indiana have met. Perhaps we'should not accuse her of favorit-
$	ism, yet the customary football games have usually been decided by
:	more than a one-point margin. The Lady appears to show partiality.
/	And, oddly enough, when Lady Luck favored Notre Dame by
I	allowing her to win, she has seldom been accused of. favoring Indiana
| . because she allowed Indiana to lose by a twenty-five point margin when
|	the Lady should have seen that.Indiana lost by a fifty point margin.
j	WORKING OUT
!	. One of the characteristics of this school is a general participation
in athletics. The fact that a man cannot make the varsity does not
. . deter him from getting out and exercising other than his facial muscles.
It is a good sign of well-rounded manhood. A man is unfair to
himself if he combines a trenchant intellect with an undeveloped and
weak physique. And there lies another collegiate advantage. You
don’t need to belong to the I. A. C. or the Rumbleberry Country Club'
in order to be able to work out at some sport. The gym is; waiting for.
you, the track is beseeching you, the. tennis courts are howling for you,
the Library golf course is wailing for you, the diamond is crying'for
you, the pool is gurgling for you, and even the good old paths here-
abouts don’t object to being walked upon.
Work out!—even if it’s only at throwing snow-balls. But best
of all, take some part in. interhall athletics. There is room for any
man with either two arms or two legs.
.	Our minor sports too are coming .into .their own. They should.
And it will be a. happy day for athletics at. Notre ..Dame when the ath-
letes in. minor, sports have done such deeds that they will be rewarded
with major recognition.	... .................
Everybody seems to have a play
instinct, but no work instinct, and
thus to make matters run along
smoothly and expeditiously it is ad-
vantageous to convert work into
play. This is, however, easier said
than done. Yet it is not impossible.
It is even possible to get fun out
of work that is compulsory, that is,
to turn it into a source of amuse-
ment and recreation — into play.
The writer once observed a party
of workmen driving piles for a
small lake-side dock. Their sole
equipment by way of machinery
was a huge iron block, a tripod, a
pulley and some rope. The work in
itself was slavishly, difficult. The
wages were pitifully small. The
weather was exceedingly warm.
Yet this work was converted into
play by the simple expedient of
raising and dropping the block to
the tune of a lilting song whose
various lines were addressed alter-
nately to the pile and the block.
There are tunes that suit every
work. They can be sung in the
heart.
Work and play have many things
in common. Like, laughter and
tears, they are never far apart.
Work that succeeds is more easily
transmuted! into play^than work
that does not? ^Successful business
- : Watch for the IJrama club’s first All-Notre Dame offering of the
year. No poetry, no farewell address, no singing—the play’s the thing.
V There is no law against a man getting out and hustling on the dock
while waiting for his ship, to come in.
A man is like a tack; he will go only as:far as his head will let him.

At this time, when the biography
and autobiography have achieved
such unprecedented popularity, it is
not strange that the long neglected,
figures of history should at last
come into their own. H.-J. Ecken-,
rode- : has, for example,; recently
published through Macmillan a bi-:
ographicaL study of “Jefferson
Davis, President of- the South.”;
Jefferson Davis is ideally situated,
from' the point of time, for the
present-day biographer; His life is
far enough removed from the pres-
ent, day to permit of a fair . and im-
partial judgment, and still close
enough to insure the collection of
really authentic data. It is in this
spirit that. Mr. Eckenrode^ ap-
proaches the.figure of Davis, a ju-
dicial spirit that; weighs the evi-
dence .and judges • Jefferson , Davis
fairly.	‘	.

SOMEWHERE AT -SEA AND OTHER
TALES. ' By John Fleming.. - Wilson.
New York: E. P. Dutton & Co. 1924? $2.
is referred to as a game, unsuccess-
ful, as drudgery. In both work
and play there is, or may be, com-
petition, rivalry, outlay of energy,
an attitude as to the outcome, the
hope of winning. It is said that
play is largely an imitative phe-
nomenon. When children “play”
work, they imitate their elders; they
are always very serious. Might it
not be then that when grown-ups
desire to convert their work into
play, they have but to reverse the
process and imitate the children—
to “work” play?
Work becomes play only when
entered into with the spirit of play.
It is the spirit of the worker that
alone is able to effect the metamor-
phosis of work into play. The de-
tail of compulsion need have noth-
ing to do with it. It is a trick of
psychology, not a formula of eco-
nomics. “Play,” psychology tells
us, “is a tendency to perform acts
which are not directly concerned
with one’s mental and vital welfare.
The trick of transmutation consists
merely in so estimating habitually
the value of our work as to come
habitually to believe that the enter-
prise in which we happen to be en-
gaged need not necessarily go to
the wall because we do not succeed,
or that somehow the welfare of
the universe does not hinge upon
our contribution to the solution of
its problems. In play, one forgets
himself. In work, he constantly
dwells upon himself. Let one for-
get himself in his work, and it be-
comes a pleasure; it becomes play.
Lincoln said that “folks are usu-
ally about as happy as they make
up their minds to be.” And so we
might say' that about as much of
our work becomes play as we have
a mind to make it. Work becomes
play when it becomes a joy, and it
becomes a joy when we learn to
love it. There is always a reason
for loving it, and we are all cap-
able of love. We can all say with
the poet: “I am not fighting my
fight, I am singing my song.”
When’ one wanders away from
the trio of accepted sea writers—
McFee, Kipling, and Conrad—
there is a certain sense of uneasy
skepticism. Yet, before Jack Lon-
don and the other • writers became
so authoritive, John Fleming Wil-
son had written some of the most
understandable and . thoroughly
technical short stories of the briny,
deep ever published. This new
volume, “Somewhere at Sea and
Other Tales,”. is a . welcome re-
edition of this unique writer.

McClure’s Magazine were the chief
mediums of Wilson’s work while he
streamed a constant trickle of nov-
els and short-stories from his teem-
ing pen. Among the greatest suc-
cesses was his story “Sparks,”
which created nationwide comment
and commendation.
Only a salt with many years of
experience on both sail and steam
ships can fully appreciate Wilson’s
complete command over the tech-
nical and pure coliquialisms (that
is, peculiarities) of the oceanic
travel. “Junk,” “The Great Arctic
Handicap,” and the “Savage
Sense,” are perhaps paramount in
illustration of his mastery.
In this . volume are aggregated
some of the gems of sea life, man-
nerisms, romance, arid lure. Those
who are Conrad “crazy” might do
well to read these little master-
pieces,7 breathing'salty tears' of "joy"
and pathos at every exclamation
point. All of the familiar strings
of life are pulled in these romances,
pulled when they mean much and
tauted when they appeal most
strongly.

To the Bookworm:
The worm has turned. And, true
to characteristics, it has turned into
a single track; blind to all others.
^0) our library is not stacked with
all the latest trash in books. Nor
can the books we have, that is a
goodly majority of them, be fond-
led and petted. It does not seem
quite consistent with an intellect-
ual person’s training to become
alarmed about the circulation of
oUr library. The library at Notre
Dame cannot be compared to the
South Bend library for two very
obvious reasons: the first is one of
purposes—the second one of pat-
ronage. It must be remembered
that the South Bend library caters
to the public. It must have books
to match thousands of tastes, be
they ever so humble. The Univer-
sity library is used principally by
students and those of a scholarly
bent.
Life is too short for us to waste
any of its precious moments in the
reading of inferior literature. The
collection of the University library
js select. If the comparative circu-
lations of the two libraries were
taken, particularly = in those fields
which are the pursuits of . students,
our intellectual standard would not
be adjudged at such a deplorably
low grade. You see therefore that
the two libraries are not quite com-
parable.	., .
For the better interests of the
student body, books which no
doubt would create a wide and live-
ly circulation are purposely kept
from the shelves.
There is some defense for your
plea, though, Mr. Bookworm. It
resides primarily and fundamental-
ly in a subjective concept. Your
objection is to the system employed
in guarding the books. Students in
। .using books from their own library
are of a most prodigal nature’. They
feel and; are wont to take liberties
which are not put into practice by
patrons of a public library. This is
an irrefutable psychological fact.
It is accordingly taken into consid-
eration in establishing libraries
which are patronized by students,
primarily.
If it might prove elucidating or
in any way encouraging the Notre
Dame library is regarded by author-
ities as an approach to the modern
ideal, which ideal is as ancient as
it is modern. Institutions intend-
ing to build libraries send represen-
tatives hereto study our plan. -But,
of course, my kind sir, you might
know of the art and science of man-
aging a library more than men who
have made a life study of the topic.

Col. Hoynes Tells
of Life Experiences
The campus of Notre Dame is
alive with traditional individuals
who have contributed to the history
of the University. And yet to the
majority 'of the students who fre-|
quent the campus, the most notable
of these is unknown.
What student has not seen an
old gentleman walking with bent
steps along the path leading from
Sorin hall to the Administration
building? To the few he meets,
who recognize him, he is addressed
simply as Colonel.
In Colonel William Hoynes, law-
yer and dean emeritus of the
Hoynes College of Law, Notre
Dame possesses a personage who
has lived a most remarkable life.
As a soldier and a journalist, as a
jurist and a dean, and as a writer
and a politician, he has distinguish-
ed himself for his sincerity and
honesty of purpose.
Colonel Hoynes was born in Ire-
land, but came to the United States
at an early age. As an apprentice,
he learned the printing trade with
the Lacrosse (Wis,), Republican,
but with the outbreak of the Civil
War, he enlisted. As a drummer
boy of 15 years old, and the young-
est member of the regiment, he
took up his military life- Not con-
tent with the duties of his position,
he intentionally neglected to prac-
tice on his drum. As a consequence,
he was given the rank for which he
had been striving—a soldier carry-
ing a gun. In the battle of Prairie
Grove, Ark., December 7, 1862, he
received a severe wound in the
head. Upon his recovery, he re-
joined his command and assisted in
the capture of Van Buren. While
participating in the battle of Vicks-
burg, he was unfortunate enough
to lose the sight of one eye. Al-
though discharged because of the
injury, he re-enlisted in the cav-
airy. After experiencing several
slight wounds, he accompanied an
expedition to Texas. Upon his re-
turn, he was mustered out of the
service.
He entered Notre Dame in 1868.
Soon after his graduation, he was
made editor of the New Brunswick
(N. J.), Daily Times, and later be-
came associated with M. M. “Brick” (
Pomeroy, in editorial work. In
1881 he became editor of the Pe-
oria (Hl.), Daily Transcript, but
left the following year to practice
law in Chicago. For several years
he devoted his time to this pro-
fession.
The University of Notre Dame
welcomed him in 1883 as dean of
the law school. In 1887, he or-
ganized and commanded the Uni-
versity Light Guards, receiving at
this time the title of Colonel.
In 1888 he was a republican
candidate for congress and in 1904
declined the nomination for a posi-
tion in that body. Pope Pius ap-
pointed him to the Knights Order
of St. Gregory in 1912. The law
i building which now bears his name,
was formally dedicated to him on
June 8, 1919.
Being a journalist of military ex-
periences, Colonel Hoynes possesses
many historic reminiscences. One
of his favorite stories deals with
the account of a march of 120
miles made in three 'days, in which
he participated. He relates it in
this way;
“During the summer of ’62, Gen-
erals Hyman and Marmaduke, with
a Confederate force of 12,000 men,
by a series of maneuvers, were in-
tent on capturing St. Louis. Two
Wool Socks 4
pair for $1.00
Union forces were in that region
at the time, one under the com-
mand of General Brunt consisting
of 8,000 men stationed at Cane Hill,
and the other under Colonel Herron
with 6,000 men situated at Wilson’s
Creek, near the present site of Jop-
lin, Missouri. Realizing that the
Confederates would attack our
forces first, because of the small-
ness of our number, Colonel Her-
ron decided upon a bold move which
would bring us nearer the main
force of General Brunt’s. In this
way, we would prevent the enemy
from isolating us. For three days
we tramped, during which time we
covered 120 miles. On a Sunday
morning we encountered the Con-
federates a short distance from
Fayetteville, and attacked them. In
the ensuing battle half of our force
was destroyed. It was here that I
received a wound in my head,
which almost resulted disastrously.
Despite the odds, our men held their
ground, repulsing the repeated at-
tacks of the enemy. Meanwhile,
General Brunt, eight miles away,
heard of the battle and came to our
rescue at 4 o’clock in the evening.
We drove the Confederates back
and that night they retreated.”

Interkall Tossers in
Sixth Series Today
Interhall basketball teams will
meet in the gym today to play off
tee sixth series of games on the
in\°rhall schedule. With the final
contests close at hand, the various
teams have been putting up fight-
ing games from start to finish, and
the games tomorrow will be no ex-
ception.
What promises to be the feature
contest on the bill, is the battle be-
tween Cadillac and Sorin, both of
which are tied for third place in
the interhall standing, The CacT
iliac tossers have been improving,
constantly since the season started,
especially on the defense, and it
has not been until late in the game
that their opponents have been
' able to score on them.
Corby and Freshman are in a
deadlock for last place and when
the two teams meet this afternoon,
it will decide which ’ of the teams
will advance in the standing.
, The Walsh performers will tackle
a tough proposition when they meet
the undefeated Carroll team. Thus
far this season Carroll - has dis-
played a brand of playing that no ]
team has been able to beat, andj
when Carroll meets the Walsh crew
today, it will be determined to keep
it’s record perfect?
The teams will line up today in
the following order:
Morning
Sorin vs. Cadillac ......   9:30
Walsh vs. Carroll .......  10:30
• Afternoon
Sophomore vs. Badin ....... 1:30
Corby vs. Frosh ..........  2:30
