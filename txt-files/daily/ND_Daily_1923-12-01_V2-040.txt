Mine was more than happy. For
three' days—and ■ nights—I; stalked
the unfrequented by-paths of South
Bend, seeking whom- I. might de-
vour. And the little red book is
chuck full of notes..

They are queer, notes, and I be-
lieve that it will be almost impossi-
ble to decipher'some of them. For
this, I presume, many a heart will
beat more regularly.

had/a great deal of meaning, 'but

worth and Dumke Entertain;
Given at Oliver Hotel.
Success crowned the efforts of the
day students, when- 250 couples at-
tended' their dance, at the Oliver
hotel. Thanksgiving night. The Ro-
tary room, in which the dance was
given, was attractively decorated. :
. Charles Butterworth and Ralph
Dumke won much applause by their
clever dialogues and' humorous
songs. The College Inn orchestra
provided the music for the occasion
and assisted in entertaining by con-
tributing several novelties to the
program. Edmund . Luther, presi-
dent of the Off-campus club, sang
“Linger a While.” . :	. •

the affair came up to every expec-
tation. Its success practically as-
sures the presenting of a vaudeville

Battle In Mud Closes Notre Dame -
Grid Season; Layden Outstand-
Ing Star; Passes Fail.
Sliding, slipping and splashing .
around in a veritable sea of mud
for 60 minutes, Rockne’s team of
“Fighting Irish” bade farewell to
a brilliant football season when it
defeated the Universityof St. Louis,
13 to 0, in a Thanksgiving' Day
clash at Sportsman’s park.	. •
The.size of the score was perhaps
the cause of no little surprise among
the football fans . of the... country
who were anticipating a huge score
for Notre Dame’s last game of the 1
year. It was the general opinion .
that the Moundsmen of St. Louis
would offer no great opposition al-
though they > did run true to form,
in that. they gave plenty of fight, ?
and once threatened to cross the
Irish goal. . ‘	.
• Layden was the “winning mud .
horse” of the game, having success-
fully negotiated the Missourians’
goal for twp touchdowns. The first,;
score resulted from a blocked punt ’
which' Layden recovered for Notre
Dairie. By virtue of steady line /
plunges, since end runs were not to
be thought of with mud and water
simmering around the ankles, Lay-
den pushed the ball over the line. .
Crowley failed to make the. extra '
point. ■ 7.	' ' .	."	•
. In the fourth 'quarter the Irish
again devoted ’ their attention 'to .
gaining their yardage by steady,
hard drives through the line and
’Layden-crashed -through^th'e'ceiiter-
for. the second; score. ' Crowley .7
kicked goal. -
• .The game was slowed up very '
noticeably by the condition of the
field which became worse as the
game wore on, and the steady . rain
that fell all afternoon did little, to .
relieve the situation. The ball,
wet and covered with *mud, proved •
to be the main difficulty for; both
sides and every few minutes, time . 7
would be taken out to wipe, off the
ball. ' Some idea may be attained
of the elusiveness of the pigskin; if
one were to compare it to a piece 7
of wet soap;. Stuhldreher was beset .
with the danger of a fumble nearly
every time he received; the. pass
from center..	7	; .
Likewise the aerial game was en-
tirely out of the question,, being re-. •
sorted to by' the JRockmen only -
twice during the entire struggled _
Despite the muddy conditioris of
the .field and a steady drizzle, the
Notre Daine football machirie played
their custoinary brand of consis-.
tent football and easily smothered
the lone scoring flash' of the Billi-.
kens, when Ramacciotti, a new-star
in the Missourians* ’ranks,' worked
the bail to the Irish 15-yard line.
The proteges of Dan Savage were
not lacking in powerful drives and ;
several, times made .. their' .first
downs as well as offering a stout
resistance to Notre Dame’s terrific
line. plunges. •	■	; -
: The game in the Mound City was
the last appearance of eight’Notre
Dame-veterans in the Irish line-up.
Captain Brown, one of the lightest
■ guards in collegiate football cir-"
cles, has been a most capable leadr
er of Rockne’s fighting team, and'
his season’s record is without a
fault. Outweighed several pounds
in all the major games of the Notre.

pound captain gave a glowing, ac-

PIONEERS
' Lengthy panegyrics are but seldom pleasant to the pars of those
who are being eulogized. For that reason alone is this editorial but a
word-—a word of congratulation to those gifted men from whose labors
The Daily was born. They had a hard battle to fight, and they fought
it like true soldiers. Minor defeats they bore bravely, and ever they
kept as their certain goal a Notre Dame Daily that would be an honor
to this institution.	.	-	.	.
Only those who have ;been pioneers in some kind of enterprise
will realize what tremendous difficulties these men faced, what long
hours of labor they sacrificed, what criticism' was.aimed at them by less
hardy souls. They did not seek praise; they realized, as anyone is
forced to realize, that, the honor attached to promoting an editorial en-
terprise at. Notre Dame is negligible as compared with the labor and
time that the enterprise demands. The man who seeks honor had best
lay deep plans for the secretaryship of the Montana club or the presi-
dency of the senior class. Editorial work builds men with quick brains,
light hearts, and shoulders that will be strong under the load of respon-
sibility—it develops, but seldom honors, the worker.	1
The men who have bequeathed-The Daily to us have doubtless
become better men because of their work—they do. not need honor. So
our hand-shake is brief. Flannery, Hayes, men of the S. A. C., and
assistantsail :-~We-congratulate you,.andoff er .to' you ..the thanks. of.
all loyal Notre Dame men. \	r
WANTED^rMEN WITH A FUTURE
Ask the man who has made it,, what ’joy there is in an attempt.
His try may have lead to ’failure, it may have, brought him to success;
but success or failure are only incidentals i in our happiness, while an
attempt is.inspiring—and exhilirating in itself. We met a youngster one
evening who was engaged in the very serious business of pelting the
moon with rocks. “Have you hit it?” we asked. “Don’t know,” he re-
plied; 7, “Think you will?” we askedl . “In .time,” he answered, and
nearly threw his arm out of joint heaving a rock that fell only a .few
million miles short of its mark.
That youngster was', happy in a hopeless attempt. Yet there .are
hundreds here rat school who are neglecting their great opportunity
for finding joy. and self-improvement in a fruitful attempt.. We .refer
to the opportunity, almost unequalled at Notre Dame, for the uninitiated
to make the debating teams. There are to .be two teams this year, for
the first time; twelve men are to be given regular berths; mother four
men will probably be chosen as alternates. While each of two teams
debates'a side of the;compulsory arbitration question, two' other teams
will carry Notre Dame’s colors into the World Court field. zXnd there
are only about three of last year’s men to form. the. nucleus of a 16-man
varsity group ! ■ . ,	\ • •
If such a prospect.doesn’t draw into the preliminaries at least
1934 out of the school’s two thousand men, we had best abandon debat-
ing for checkers. There are many, among us, particularly undergrad-
uates, who will'leave Notre Dame with but one regret—-that we have
not accomplished-anything worthy: of being remembered.- This is the
golden opportunity for those whose aspirations are many but whose
attempts are few. If you wort now you will not wail toward the close
of your senior year. If you work now you willhave a solid achievement
upon which to stand, securely and with confidence.
. Sign up with Father Bolger;. give him a chance to make you a
varsity debater. If he can’t do it in time, there is probably no man
living who can; and not until that failure are you justified in mapping
out your future career .as ;a peanut-vendor.
r From Other Pens
.	. CARRY ON.
Don’t let down. This is the time
of year when the freshmen begin
to feel the first gnawing pangs of
home-sickness; studies commence to
get-' hard; unexpected difficulties
arise-daily; the indifferent attitude
of . the campus becomes unbearable,
the room isn’t what he wasr accus-
tomed to at home; the food unpala-
'table; everyone is ■ critical and
scornful. -
Such things are to be expected
with a change of environment. Cut
loose from1 his parent’s apron
strings, the only thing for a student
to do is to adjust himself to his col-

lege life.-—The DePauw.
One of the recent hazing stunts
at 'the University of New York
consisted in'a Commerce freshman,
with' legs blackened, and with his
clothes backwards' and his ^pants
tolled up, giving • a. series . of
speeches onz several of the . busiest
streets, including . 'Broadway, and
.42nd .street. His' best effort was
“Which .'Came' First, the, Chicken, or
the. Egg?’,’ ..One of great scientific
interest was “Why; the. Ocean is so
Close to the: Shore.”- Perhaps his
most eloquent effort was made on
the subject of, .“Our Courageous
Cops.”
Popularity is but too often a syn-
onym for passivity. .

While Tom Hodgson should have
been very, very happy last night,
methinks there was a sad look in
his eye as he gazed about the
crowded ball room, and thought that,
the Glee club had declined the
Thanksgiving' dance—-because so
many of the boys would be going
home!
-o- -o-
But all night long, sorrow not-
withstanding, Tom never missed a
step.
-o- -o-
How. could Rickard, Stoeckley, or
any other songbird whose doubts
led to such prosperity for the Day-
Students. .
-o- -o-
There was weeping and gnashing
of teeth when Dumke announced
that “the faculty had rescinded
their order and would permit danc-
ing until 12 only” . . . . With such
music, with such partners, with
such. atmosphere, and with such
suchness, even the most blase cried
out in rage—“On ■with the Dance,”
and swore great oaths at the fates!
• . < -o- -o- .
. Dumke and Butterworth—where
would the Big Five be without these
t\vb admirable - warblers—imagine
calling Dunjke a warbler!!—I have
often wondered why the Big Five
doesn’t adopt the slogan—“We are
Seven!”
-o- -o-
However, not even these two are
beyond the arm of this column.
Now I COULD, tell a few things
about these two, but Charlie would
probably say—“You don’t think you
can get away with that stuff out
here,” and Ralph would probably
echo him.by exclaiming, “You. don’t
think you can get away with THAT
stuff out here!”
-o- -o-
And then, if I did tell onxCharlie
or Ralph, it would probably bring
dissension to the Big Five, and this
would hurt the College Inn'Where
they play (Adv.), and this would
affect _the LaSalle hotel, where - the
College Inn is’ located'(Another
Adv.), and this would bring some
sort of depression to the prosperous
city of South Bend (Chamber of
Commerce take note), and this
would in turn affect Notre Dame—
so I guess we’ll let ..Charlie and
Ralph run their course—another
phantasy of, the imagination is to
imagine Ralph running! -	• .

Not to make.this column resemble
the “Society” of the South Bend ri-
vals,, but just to-express-an opinion,
it was very pleasant and altogether
desirable, to see so many St. Mary’s
girls at the dance. As I walked'un-
noticed and unseen, along the
crowded mezzanine, (note the

Editor of NOTRE DAME DAILY:
A while back we had seniors.
Then a change came. We still had
seniors, but the seniors had canes;
so we had seniors and senior canes.
Now we have seniors again. Will
someone tell us what happened to
the canes?
We understand that the majority
of the members of the Senior class
voted for canes. We are told that
the majority of seniors purchased
canes and. that rules were submitted
to the members of the class gov-
erning the occasions upon which the
canes should be carried. Thus the
conclusion is that the majority of
the members of the Senior class
should carry canes upon the ap-
pointed occasions.
However, it is apparent that this
is not, consistently done, and an-
other question comes to mind: Can
it be that the power of the minority
—the. men who did not want canes
—rules the Senior class after all?
Perhaps some senior will be able to
put us straight on this matter.

Editor of NOTRE DAME DAILY:
The members Of the library staff
wish to make an. appeal to the spirit
of fairness that ought to character-
ize every Notre Dame man. No ef-
fort is being spared to the student
body and no one has been slighted
in any way who has asked for as-
sistance. On the other hand, the
staff has reasons for very serious
complaint, especially. in the refer-
ence department of the library.
Students are limited by very few
rules. ' Only those rules are. made
which will afford a greater use to
all. . These rules were. promulgated
in printed form at the beginning of
the year, hence, ignorance of the
law in. this case does not excuse.
Books have been removed from the
general reference room, and also
‘from .the periodical ro.om;>--At.pres--
ent the bound volumes of period-
icals which were taken are very
much in need by the debaters. We

out of print. The • thoughtlessness
of the student who has removed

quently beert asked to give my
opinion as to the relative merits of
the westerners and these eastern
elevens, and to tell why Notre Dame
is so great.
I do not care to make compari-
sons, but I will say that Notre Dame
is one of the shiftiest and fastest
football organizations I have ever
seen. The team is composed of
seasoned players, wonderfully
coached.	-
Furthermore, I have no hesitancy
in discussing this great eleven in all
its details. It is a team in which
every man can run a hundred yards
in comparatively fast time, and with
illtle to choose between the line and
the backfield in the matter of speed,
a rather unusual situation with a
college eleven.
The western team is not particu-
larly heavy and there is a notice-
able lack of mere “beef” in the
line, which is so often more of a
handicap than, a help under the
present rules.
: Contrary to the general belief,
the Notre Dame plays are not in-
tricate and depend on timing and
execution for. their success’. This
might be noted by coaches.and play-
ers. Rockne gives his team about
.a dozen plays of the old-fashioned
type and depends upon getting such
percision and teamwork that they
are unstoppable.
As a. matter of fact, a couple of;
years ago he diagrammed the plays
he was going to use to an Army
scout before an Army game and
then went up to West Point and
used the very same plays and
gained ground.
While the Notre Dame team is a.
hard playing, splendid tackling
eleven, their play is particularly,
free from any objectionable feat-
ures. They do not break the rules
and play’clean,'hard football.
As a matter' of fact, it is: very,
difficult for any team to. attempt
to play dirty football and accom-
plish anything.. Officials are too
’alert to allow anything to get away
without being observed, and the

cretion as a vamp and failed—we
know not why—to overplay her
part. The picture ran red with
liquor of the colored-water type;—
!	and that nearly characterizes the
i	movie. There was a prize collection

player who holds, gets offside or in
any other 'respect infringes on the
football code, is more of a handi-
cap to his team than a help.
A great deal has been said about
the Notre Dame forward passing
game. In. his games in the East
this fall, Rockne used the pass as a
threat more than a direct offensive
weapon. The Notre Dame backs
and ends handle the pass beautifully
and this fact has a very damaging
effect on the opponents’ secondary
defense, who are always laying
back expecting the pass. As a re-
sult, Notre Dame tried only a few
forward, passes and depended upon
its rushing game.
The Notre Dame backs are par-
ticularly keen in defending against
forward passes; in fact, their for-
ward pass defense is the best I
have seen in all my career. They
play the ball with unerring ac-
curacy and every man on the team
seems to know exactly what he is
to do and how he is to do it. As
a result, the Notre Dame backs re-
cover a great many passes from
the opposition.
The Notre Dame offensive forma-
tion is ordinarily played from a

balanced line with the quarterback
under center and the backs in the;
old-fashioned parallel line. On a
certain signal, the backs usually
jump into a tandem formation on
the right or left.
The Notre Dame end run is one
of the best I ever have seen. Both
guards get in the interference and
a veritable mass of men Is thus
thrown on either flank. All the
backs are particularly good at tak-
ing their openings, starting one
way and turning, reversing their
field with-great speed.
Rockne believes in playing his
offensive so that a forward pass
goes with every offensive play. The
play starts as either an end run or
a pass. As a result, the defensive
backfield is in a quandry not know-
ing whether to come up and stop

Choice of a Career
From the Yale News
THE NINETY-FOUR
Someone, probably an insurance
agent, was quoted recently as saying
that from the mass of one hundred
college graduates • one individual only
rose to the Polo and butler class, peril-
ously near the top of the. financial lad-
der. Five others became comfortably
off and found themselves after twenty
years at the small I yacht and chauffeur
stage. The other ninety-four presum-
ably congregate in the great section of
the American people who drive their
own Buicks to the golf club. In other
words, dreaming about being a rich
man is one thing, and making the grade
is “something else again.”
Yet the ninety-four presumably work
just as hard as the sumptuous six Their
business is the axis on which a small
and uninteresting world revolves. They
have become dfevotees of the dollar
and when that.fickle deity deserts, have
nowhere else, to turn. Jammed In a
dull, straight rut of business they can
never leave the road and jump the fence
into finer'fields of life. This, then, is
the portion of ninety-four men out of
every hundred now on the campus.
The answer to the problem lies in
the proper choice of a career.

the run or stay back’ for the pass.
In the same way, a very effective
cross-buck is used with one back
faking, to the right and the other
back carrying the ball through cen-
ter. Here again, ,the forward pass
works as a corrollary of the back
making the fake. <
The. three strongest running
plays Notre Dame has shown are an
end run, two backs working on the
end, a back and end on the tackle
with two guards in the interference.
The backs and guards start on a
parallel line running toward the
end. When the backs reach the
end, the guards turn abruptly down
field, the runner behind them using
these interferers as a screen and
cutting in or out as they cover the
offensive beaks. This play is par-
ticularly strong.

THE OUTLINE OF. LITERATURE,
Edited by. John Drinkwater; 3
vols., .illustrated. Vol. I. ~ ~
Putman’s Sons, New York.
In an age when superficiality , is
one of the deepest qualities of the
world’s citizens, we are overfed with
outline.. Science,- art history, and
literature, in outline have issued
, from the. press, with spasmodic fre-
quency. Football only remains to
be outlined. Coach,Rockne might
. profitably, edit an Outlirie .of Foot-
, ball,, which would undoubtedly be
of more value than any recent at-
. tempts at sketching. ■	_
The idea'behind Outlines of This-
and-That is . a good one. : Lacking
time, and sometimes the inclination,
to study. 'deeply. a • subject, it must
be concentrated: and presented' .in
such a fashion that it may be. as-
similated with not too great an ex-
penditure of time and effort. Sci-
ence, history, and literature, have
been examined invariably without a
background which co-ordinates facts
arid establishes the general trend.
. In the study and teaching of lit-
erature . we have considered only
individual books, authors, or, more
broadly, sometimes. . the ■ works : of
nations. Rarely do we inquire into
the trend that discloses itself in the
study of world-literature as a
■ '■ whole. . .	.'. .7 ■ ' .
The Outline of Literature is sig-
, niff cant, because it tries, and with a
certain., amount of success, to give
us this breadth of view. Of course
the information, is rapidly.-sketched
arid frequently it is riot sufficiently
qualified. There is the common de-
. Jusion of the Dark Age with which
• to reckon. Then, we pay see with-
out looking too- closely that it was
edited by an Englishman. We, would
be .pleased had he selected more of
the. paintings of the great world
masters for illustrative purposes and
not so many by Englishmen. . It .is
as unbiased and broad, probably, as
any work of this kind can be. The
author’s version of the beginnings
of. literature, and the chapters on
Greek and. Roman. literature, are
particularly interesting.'__________• •
.■ The Outline is profoundly artis-
tic. It is worth reading for its con-
centrated view of the entire field
of literature. We should, occasion-
ally detach ourselves from the en-
. joyirierit of masterpieces separately,
and view the historical progress of
literature as a whole. - H. F. B:

are more adroit in the art of fast
and accurate tackling. As a field
leader, Brown was alert to every
move, of the opposition; every de-
cision of the referees, and the in-
stant a decision appeared question-
able, the “little giant” from Youngs-
town was ready to make sure that
nothirig was “being, put over.”
Harvey Brown began his football
career at Notre Dame as a backfield
candidate, but the critical eye. of
the resourceful Rockne, whose in-
finite sense of judgment decided’
otherwise, believing that in Brown
he possessed another Maury Smith,
Brown was put in the line, where
he has performed in brilliant style.’
Notre Dame will lose a set of
sparkling, backfield stars in the per-,
sons of Dutch Bergman III, and
William “Red” Maher, of snaky hip
fame. These two scintillating per-
formers have served,on the Fight-
ing Irish squad for three years and
began their first year as third string
substitutes to that brilliant aggre-
gation of stars composed of Cast-
ner, Mohardt, Coughline and Walsh,
that carried the pigskin to victory
for two undefeated years. Last
year they made their letters and di-
vided honors with Miller and Crow-
ley. ■	.	■
, This year, both men continued
their fast pace with Maher, holding
third place in the western scoring,
calendar.. Maher’s shifty hip ac-
tion has made him one of the most
elusive field runners in the game..
Bergman has been a,. consistent
ground-gainer for the past; three
years, and took a prominent part,
in Notre Danie’s invarion of the-
eastern football realms.
Mayl and Oberst have completed
three years of service on the Notre
Dame line, but not until this year
has Mayl, captain of the T923-24

show his stuff, having acted as a

in breaking up the opposition’s plays
before they got started.
Oberst was a member of the
aquad in 1920, but remained out
of the game due to an injury, dur-
ing the season of ’21. For the past
