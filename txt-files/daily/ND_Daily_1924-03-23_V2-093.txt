chairman will call for each member
to speak'on one of the topics in it.
Nd member will know his definite
subject until called upon to speak,

Coach Harry Gill,' brilliant Illi-
nois track mentor, is already mak-
ing plans for the outdoor season,
and the impatient -Illini trackmen,
training; on the indoor coursew are
counting; the:conquests that will be
chalked' 'up in their favor this
spring. ’ The removal of the track
team outdoors will be to the advan-
tage of the Illini squad; since their
opportunities to gather more points
will‘increase with the. added events.
Preparing for Good .Year
, The usual vacation between the;
indoor, and the outdoor season , ac-
corded to track athletes ,will be
something; unknown, to the Sucker
steppers ./this year. The Urbana
squad .is preparing for one of the
best„traclc-:seaso.ns_that__has_bee.n.
expected, at the .Sucker school for.
several years, although'goodtrack
years are. custoriiary at Illinois.
। The .'220-yard dash, discus throw,
javelin, and hammer will be the
added events that. will. come with
the outdoor season and the, dope-
sters are. already crediting . Illinois
with 10 to 15 additional points.
; In /the javelin throw, Coach Gill
can .afford to count on. two,-point
getters in Angier and Schildhauer.
The former holds the national rec-
ord, in the javalin. while Schildhauer
has been, tossirig -194 feet with con-
sistency \in the : UrbanaArmory.
The; Illinois indoor .track course is
large; enough to permit throwing
of the javelin indoors7and the arm-
ory also boast of one of the longest
indoor straightaways in America.
Schildhauer will also be one of the
leading discus men in the confer-
ence.	. .
Father Cunningham,: C. , S. C.,
head of the department of educa-
tion, addressed the nuns of the nine

terday afternoon at St. Joseph’s
academy.' . Father/’ Cunningham

Training” with reference to the In-
diana law of 1923 for the certifica-
tion of teachers.
' Father Cunningham is, in receipt
of a leter from Father Weigand,
of Stubenviile, Ohio, who requests
that a man be recommended as
physical training instructor for a
new Catholic community center in
Stubenviile. The letter was re-
ferred to Brother Barnabus, who is
head of the Knights of Columbus
“Boy Life bureau.” The branch of1
education will be a department of
the school of education which will j
be opened this fall. Father Cun-
ningham will be the dean of this
school.
It was announced yesterday that
Brother. Barnabus will probably ar-
rive in South Bend Tuesday. Broth-
er Barnabus will address the

to Address Seminar
Professor Benjamin Dubois, who
is head of the French department
of South Bend high, will be the
principal speaker at a regular meet-
ing of the Educational Seminar in
Sorin hall Monday night. He will
endeavor to prove that the phonetic
method of teaching a foreign lan-
guage is essential. . Professor Du-
bois employes the phonetic method
in teaching his classes.
Various methods of teaching for-
eign languages, which were - out-
lined at the last meeting by Father
Cunningham, will be discussed, by
Seminar members...... ........ .

With the sprint events lengthened I
to 100 and 220 yards, Illinois looks
forward to two new stars in the |
speed runs when Evans arid Hughes]
face • the starter’s gun. Both men1
are' slow starters arid consequently
were not expected to shine on the
indoor track, but. with the added
distance; both runners should be
able to cross the tape in ...record
time. Evans ’ holds a mark of
,:21 1-5 in the 220-yard dash.
Johnson, Kinsey and Rehms,, are
islated to provide some of the fast-
est hurdle competition in the con-
ference.
Illinois will be represented on the
Pacific coast by her record-breaking
track (team when the Suckers meet
California early in the spring. The
Gillmen will appear on Cartier field
May 10.for.the only, dual meet that

ALL THAT IS GOLD DOES NOT GLITTER
In the process of . pounding out day after day just what is wrong
with. humanity in general and Notre Dame in particular it would not
hurt at all to pause arid note a few breeches that have NOT been com- ’
mitted. , ( •'	.	■	• ‘ i
We have not seen women standing in a street car where there ]
were students seated. We have not seen many students smoking in .
carsr.where women were present. We have not seen-any approval
among students of the poor jokes that sometimes slip into the bills at ]
down-town amusement houses. We have not seen any direct dis- j
.respect’toward older : persons coming from students. The school is :
not flooded-with complaints of students’ activities downtown as other
schools often are. Arid there are many other performances on the
catalogue of ill manners that cannot-apply to the average Notre Dame
man?;;	...:
On the contrary/the average Notre Dame man is a gentleman.
' Therefore this editorial is directed to only a few men. . The average
- Notr.e Dame men want a full enrollment.*
./j'. j rr:-'-. .
At the present time almost all hovels are of a kind—naturalistic,
pessimistic,^cynical,, soulless. But a few novels are of the opposite
kind-—realistic,' optimistic/’sympathetic, human. The bulk of modern
’ literature presumes that ,life; is truly' interpreted, through the intellect.
It reports things impressionistically, sketchilyj by means of the in-
tellect alone, while it;disregards the jsoul and its means of comprehen-
sion,sympathy, r It appears ^profound, but it is thorough in but a limited
sphere,—it does not include;all of man.
. Jt looks with but one'eye, and looks .in but one direction. It fo-
cuses its gaze on imperfection/on vice, drunkenness,, divorce, sexuality,
and passion. It sees life as gloomy; and purposeless. Literature, that,
looks: with both eyes, that uses both: higher faculties of man, the soul
as: well • as the ' intellect/is comprehensive, and truly representative.
Such is the literature of Barrie, Dickens, Hutchinsonj Lamb, Tarking-
tori/Corirad, Stevenson, and bthers of the kind.
. If the cynical’writers .would use both.eyes (as those named here
do) ‘to look at life they would see life truly and see it- whole. They
would leaf ri to know real men in a real world, and would learn of the
goodness of men. They would come to a sympathetic appreciation
. of him. .	•>' '	, ...... j	. -	;
Some, of these;books are going campus' rounds. For correcting
the,.vision.,of much romanticism, they may be valuable in understand-
ing; life, but chosen as the .only-means of viewing life, they are re-
pulsive and danger ous. to truth,-r-and to morals. .

education,; but’opportunities afforded-in the co-educational school may
easily lead .to excess. It is this condition which turns out polished

Watch Criticism
Too muchof the criticism broad-
casted today is. destructive.. Too
many find faults, not to, help cor-
rect an existing wrong,' but only
brodcast their feelings, tainted with
envy and jealousy, to injure an-
other. ■ '
Criticism has its value, especial-
ly to inform a person of errors so
that he who has erred ma ybe better
if not be perfect in doing the same
act the next time. Criticism de-
notes helpful con-ections, yet there
is an increase in the mere words of
ridicule, defamation,' and ill feel-
ing, founded on a vague', general
dissatisfaction. <
University students, who are con-
sidered to be more liberal minded
than any others because of . their
broader knowledge of the peculiar-
ities of man. and nature, should edu-
cate thbriiselves not to express their
dislikes, unless they have first
looked at the question from every
possible angle and are * sure that
their. criticism is not the result 'of
a mere burst of passion.
With so much so-called criticism
afloat, .brie might .even i adhere., to
the old rule to believe only one-half
of all one hears, one-half of all
one sees,, and none of what one
thinks .without personal. investiga-
tion arid reliable authority.—Daily

“Evening settles down softly up-
on the purple lake. The stillness sb
apparent during the heat of the day
is now intensified. A fisherman’s
landing “Hallo” crashes'surprising-
ly clear across the smooth water.
A white moon creeps up from be-
hind a hill, turning a, gray world
into a blue fantasy of light arid
shadow. There is a slight sound.
The creak of oar-locks intrudes as
an invisible boat gurgles its way
through the quiet pond. ..Then
nothing is heard. The scene seems
set,' awaiting something that would
further enhance its beauty.' Across
the ake there floats the . peaceful
yet appealing notes of a saxaphone. |

the nigh.t that it is not a sound—-it
is" a part of the scheme. And Mary

lay within the stillness; A cloud

University to Have
School of Expression
It was made known yesterday
that next year there will be a school
f oral expression at the univer-
uy under the auspices of the col-
lege of arts and etters with Mr.
gullivan as the dean. It will offer
four year course in that subject
^th a minimum requirement of 36
hours spent in the study of public
If will be somewhat akin to the
famous .Leland Powers school at
Boston, the only differences being
that it will be primarily for under-
graduates and ’ that other subjects
than public speaking will be re-
ouired for graduation. English, a
foreign ' language, and philosophy
will probably be required, and there
wil be possibly 70 hours of elective
subjects.
At present there are only about
25 hours of work offered in that
course, but next year there will be
many more courses offered and
there also will be some new instruc-
tors. Although the rough details of
the plan have been worked > out at
present, they have beesn approved
by the- authorities and- the ’ new
course is assured. Complete de-
tails including the new .courses and
the required subjects will soon be
published.

OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY—
Students of Ohio State university
have organized a- vigilance commit-
tee to see that no one tramps on the
lawns or stray from paths of the
campus. The students who repeat-
edly violate this rule are subject to
a, penalty, by the sudents’ council,
and any outsiders who are. caught
arb requested to leave the campus.
This will hold good until all dan-
ger of marring the beauty of the
campus by promiscous trampling is
past.
HARVARD UNIVERSITY—The
faculty has recently passed novel
regulations governing the admis-
sion of new students. Hereafter
the incoming Freshman class will
be limited to a thousand and except
in certain cases no students will be
admitted to advanced standing
without extraordinary qualifica-
tions. z The entrance requirements
were also changed considerably.
Students whose native tongue is
English will not be admitted if they
are deficient in composition. The
first seven of graduating, classes
from recognized high schools will
be admitted without examination.
The September examination, will no
longer be accepted as preliminary,
but the student must show class-
work credit.
NEW' . YORK UNIVERSITY—
Students of New York university
are . now contemplating a plan
whereby all students will elect rep-
resentatives to the student senate.
This, body will have entire jurisdic-.

Drama Club Seeks
Female Characters
evening in Walsh hall basement.
No parts have yet been assigned,
and the tryout is for the purpose
of making selection' possible.
Men will have to-be women!
Such is the problem facing the
Drama club as a result of a decis-'
ion of the university authorities
which will prevent the club from
hiring professional actresses to aid
them in the coming presentation of
“The Servant in the House.”
The club, in attempting a serious
play, reached the conclusion that it
would not be as effective with men
playing the female characters as it
would be if actresses were secured.
The plan was not approved, how-
ever, and as a result a call has been
made for female'characters in the
final tryouts to be held Tuesday

A Bit of a Talk
About Entertainment
Beginning today. the Blackstone
Theatre will offer, as specialty en-
tertainment, acts from the PAN-
TAGES CIRCUIT OF VAUDE-
VILLE, to supplement the regular
film attraction. Those of you from
the West, particularly the Pacific
Coast, are familiar with the high
standing of this circuit. To those
of you who because of geographical
limitations, are not familiar with
Pantages, we may say that this cir-
cui has the reputation of ranking
with the best vaudeville circuits in
the country. .
Pantages acts are being brought to
the Blackstone Theatre in agree-
ment with our ’policy .to provide a
program which will appeal especial-
ly to the type of theatre-goers rep-
resented by the man of Notre Dame.
We are, first, a motion picture
house, and consequently set as the
first requirement of a worthwhile
program the exhibition of high class
pictures. We mean, of. course, to
combine good screen entertainment
with a like quality of stage amuse-
ment. And we. believe that we have
convinced you that the Blackstone
provides a certain kind of diversion
which you can’t, get anywhere else
in South ’ Bbrid'f namely, a REAL'
picture supported by high grade
specialties — the most entertain-
ment for the least money.
We sincerely hope always to have
and to be worthy of your friendship
and patronage. . -

VALUE OF BASEBALL
SCIENCE RECOGNIZED
BASEBALL COACHES USE THE
.	. CROUCHING START TO,
.'	SCORE FROM THIRD
ON THE LEVEL
By LARRY KELLY
• Yesterday1
White Sox ..
Cincinnati ..
The modern sport' devotee who
has come to consider himself well
versed in the many branches of ath-
letics cannot help but notice that
the hand of progress has been felt
in- the sport world as much as in
any other particular world. The
passing of time has revolutionized
football, basketball, track, tennis,
ail'd golf, and it has also brought a
change over- baseball 'that cannot
be; denied.
’ /The value of science in a game is
being more than just valued. It is
being employed to the greatest ex-
' tent. Track coaches spend hours
drilling sprinters on the mark; per-
fecting their start. The man with
the lightriirig get-away can afford to
challenge all odds. .But it has never
occurred to- baseball managers that
a.irunner-at third base using a
crouching start has the best chance
against all .odds .to score on a sac-
rifice fly.' *	' ■	’	.
/Ordinarily, if a fly ball is hit into
left field'' witha7 runner on third,
the man will stand there for a mo-
riient, take a look or two-. at the
fielder, touch, the-sack arid start fpr
horiie. As a result, the outfielder
with only an ordinary arm can
throw out the runner at the plate
no, matter how fast he; is on the
straight-away.

When Ralph Hills, junior at
Princeton, heaved the' 16-pound
shot 47 feet 11 1-2 inches recently,
he came within three feet and half
an inch of the world’s record. That
record was made back in 1909,
when Ralph Rose of: Michigan
tossed the lead ball 51 feet. Paddy
McDonald, New York policeman,
comes in for third honors, he put
the shot 47 feet ;7 1-2 inches in
1917, hanging up "a new national
championship record for the A.

Hornsby writes that, 90 per cent
of college batters can’t touch a low
ball. Jack Barry, of Holy Cross,
says that some hitters he has seen
in college ranks would make better
aviators. They show marked ability
to drive the ball into the clouds. '
Several important changes were
made at the annual meeting of the
grid committee in New York City
yesterday afternoon.
The kickoff will be made from the
50-yard line and. a penalty of, five
yards will be imposed upon teams
delaying the game. It was also
decided to try for. the extra point
after the touchdown, will be made
from the three-yard line instead of
the ten-yard line. The committee
also- decided i that no mud or arti-
ficial kicking tees will be allowed. :
Sh! Gets Flying Start .
tjNow to consider < applying the
theory of the track coach to- the
runner on third base, we will as-
siiine that the coacher is capable of
evoking ordinary judgment guaged
by; “baseball sense.” With a fly
ball riding out.to left field, the run-
ner on third crouches at the sack
ir/sprinter fashion and at a signal
from the coacher, he gets away to
a? flying start and beats the ball to
the home plate.	.

“Baseball hands”, are an asset to
any ball player, and like many oth--
er'of the so-called fine points, the
average baseball fan never realizes
the part^a player’s hands play, in-
sofar as his success as a baseball
player is concerried.
We point to Kamm, Frisch and
several other great infielders who
are noted for their ability to hanT
die the ball with the utmost dex-
terity. Kamm and his famous
“sweep” is a fit example for all
young infielders to follow.

Paul Castner, of Notre Dame, is
a star at many kinds of sports, but
this year he hasn’t been playing
hockey.. A year ago he had his hip
dislocated in one of the last foot-
ball games of, the season, so this
past fall he thought he would do a
little light training by practicing
with the hockey squad. He went
to Coach Rockne for permission,
which was promptly refused.
“You can’t take a chance with
your leg,” said Rockne. ,
“But the leg is all right now,”
argued Castner. I’ve been running
and‘walking on it for a long time,
and it isn’t bothering me at all.”
“Nothing -doing,” said Rockne;
“you can’t play hockey.”
“Why,” .said Castner, “hockey
is an easy gairie. It isn’t, danger-
ous.”	.	.
‘‘Don’t you believe it,” exclaimed
Rockne. “Any game that-puts a

throw to first base fast enough to
put the runner out on the third-
strikes as was necessary in.thoes
days. His ability as a sprinter shone
here, as he would run after the bat-
ter and catch him every time. This
so chagrined the Goshenites that
they “framed” the catcher bn their
return game. He was asked to race
with a “local Goshen messenger
boy.” It turned out that the “mes.
senger boy” was a runner of riv
tional fame. 1	.
Anticipating Jewett’s being beat-
en, the Gosltenites had placed their
last nickel on the, result. In
meantimej the students at Notre
Dame had not been idle. • Tlie vis-
itors had come to South Bend.froni
Goshen in hacks .they had hired for
the occasion. The students paid off
the hack drivers, informing them
they would not be.needed for the
return trip. The .hack drivers went
home. Jewett won.
“You-know I never did hear just
how long it. took those fellows to
walk home,” :said Mr. Jewett, while
reminiscing lately.—Brooklyn Daily
