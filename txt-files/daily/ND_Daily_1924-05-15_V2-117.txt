“THE NECESSITY OF RELIGION
IN EDUCATION” DISCUSSED
At meeting of knights.
‘ “The Necessity of Religion in-
Education” was ably , discussed by
Father Williarii Bolger, C. S. C.,
head of the department of politics
and economics, at the regular meet-
irig of Notre Dariie Knights of Co--
. lumbus, Tuesday night.	•
. “Because religion touches life so
intimately and at so many points,”
said the speaker, ■ “it comes about
that if one delves deeply into any
of - the great human problems of
the day-—capital and labor, divorce^
birth control and the treatment of
the defective and dependent class-
‘ es—he iri.eyitably comes upon a re-
ligious question. ।	;	;
' “Hence the teachers of the so-
cial sciences, whether they wish to
or riot, constantly enter the -field
of ethics. and very, often make; ex-
1 cursions into the - field of religion.
If these instructors are not guided
by sound ethical and* religious
teaching, they necessarily become,
exponents of ..false'ethics and false
religion,' with " great detriment to
the faith and riiorals of their pu-
pils.” ..	.	..
' Father Bolger - pointed out that
■false religious arid, moral training
are-especially; darigerous to young
men and young woinen because the
. average student does not fear in-
tellectual error and as a result does
notv try to guard, against it.' “Perr
sons of average virtue^ however, do
^fea'^niotal^rfbi^^aidT-F-ather^Bbl—
ger, “and' they .are' ori their' guard.
“He, who has committed grave
sins of the .flesh,, is in his best
moments humiliated by; the recol-
lection and realization of his wrong.,
On the other hand, the individual
who has fallen into grave intellect-:
ual erroi’—who has become •: ari
; atheist, : for ; example — becomes
proud of his error. He thinks he
-is a few jumps...ahead of the' rest
of. meh,' and just because of his
pride, he is unable to repent -and
< unable,. to' return- to sajie-minded-
ness. Iri.ihy opinion, a'book attack-
ing, faith or .morals is more .dang'er-
ous by far to the ^average young
. man -than is a woman of Joose
morals.” ‘	' ■	/	.	. ■
At; the business session preceding
the - address, plans were; completed
for. the conferring of the first de-
gree on a class of candidates at
Notre Dariie tonight, and for. the
exemplification of the 'second and
third degrees Sunday at Mishawaka.'
., Arrangements were also announced
• for, the banquet to be held at the
.Oliver hotel following the initiation
■ Sunday.. -	, -	:
Deputy: Grand Knight Ray Cun-
ningham, editor of the Santa Maria,
stated that the: publication would
■ appear , on Thursday of next week.
A copy will be given .to every Notre
Dame knight;-

THE 1924 DOME ON
CAMPUS TODAY
FATHER WALSH PRESENTED
WITH FIRST COPY OF AN-
NUAL DELIVERED AT N. D.
The Dome of ,’24 will be .dis-
tributed- jtoday. Late - yesterday
evening a! motor-van from Chicago ' '
arrived on the campus bearing 1,500
copies of the year book, packed in .1
cases containing 150 copies each.
The van left the bindery in Chicago
early Wednesday and the Domes
were on the campus one day in ad-
vance of the date set for;distri- .
bution.	.
One copy of the Dome has been
on*the campus- for several days. .
Father Walsh, president of the Uni- ;
versity, and to whom the Dome wa". ‘ .
dedicated, was one of the first to
see the book, and he seemed much
pleased with it.	■ v ■
A wealth of color . arising in the
opening section'of the book, and
running through the-scenic section, : :
the. elaborate athletic division, and
the new “Notre Dame Life” section,
makes the Dome this year the most
artistic that has appeared on the 1
campus.in years'. Artistry of detail'
has not been overlooked. Arrange-, .
ment of senior and junior photo- ; .
graphs; the “color-frame” given to .
each class president and his “lady”; -
the paneling ‘ of\ the" class officers
against the distinctive background
typically “Notre Dame”; the hall
groups and hall scenes and the sec-
tion and division pages all reflect
great credit on the art staff of the > '
book. Many new features, both in , .
content and style of make-up, keep ‘ .
the ^ijqtesgsk-.froni the ^opening^pagej./
througli',tKe''six books and ‘tKe^a(L^~'‘'
vertising ■section to the. “final
glimpse of the Dome rising above z:
the treetops.” '	.	; .-
The Dome will be distributed be- - '
ginning this morning at . 8 o’clock •

man arid Sophomore halls the Dome
will be distributed from one'central
room. The number of this room
is marked on the sign in' each hall.
All Domes not already • paid for,
either by cash of through the sec- .
retary’s office, will be released upon

To the presidents of campus clubs
and organizations:
Early this year, the president of
the Student Activities Council, in
an attempt, to alleviate the over-
organization state existing on the
campus, appointed a committee of
one to make recommendations for
the curtailment of Notre Dame
clubs. The heads of: the various
organizations were called together
and informed that ’ the S. A. C.
would refuse recognition to any
campus club that failed to measure
up to the standard of a reasonable
amount of worth-while activity.
In order that proper recommend-
ations may be drafted for the S.
A. C. to act upon, the officers of
each campus club are requested to
file a repofrt of their respective
club’s activities during the past
year. This report must be in the
hands of the committee not later
than May 25. Any club which does
not comply with this request will
automatically waive the/right to
recognition on the campus.
Exceptions to this rule: Glee
club, Band, Orchestra, Shakespeare
club, Drama club,. Knights of Co-
lumbus, Monogram club, St. Thom-
as Philosophical society, the A. I.
E. E. and Minor Sports, clubs.

MAROONS GO TO JAPAN.
LUDWIG ELECTED CLUB HEAD.
' America is continually being visited by eminent Europeans who
1 no sooner than they walk down the gang plank off the trans-Atlantic
steamers^ begin exploding their theories upon the gullible inhabitants of
this country. One of these recent visitors is Bertrand Russell, a Bri-
• tish philosopher, mathematician, and socialist, and he avers that Ameri-
ca will soon rule the -world, with Europe and Asia as subject provinces
The underlying’issue of his statement, not unlike the comments of other
European visitors, is purely psychological. He is trying to flatter us,
7 as it were, by telling us how powerful we are; and then while we are
supposed to gloat 'over his deceitful praise, he intends to inject into us
a bit of his propaganda against France, the: nation’which today can
—dictate.to all.of Europe;	•	--------.-7--/.:^
He continues: “The one immediate thing the United States can do
to help -Europe is to ask France to pay the debt to the Americans. If
• France pays it she will be .financially crippled; if she'doesn’t it-will
damage her international credit. Either way it will check France’s
. mounting armaments which'are menacing Europe. This is what I mean
by. the future world dominance of the United States. It can today con-
ceivably make France a subject province.; Since the United. States
’ wants tbz lend money and all other, countries' want to borrow, Europe
'and Asia must eventually become economically, independent. When no
country can make war without the support of America there will be .a
certain kind of peace.” .	"	/ / / ;
Russell, it can plainly, be seen, is taking the same attitude other
Britishers do. England is and has been for centuries the .mistress of
the sea. But with recent developments, the aeroplane is being made far
superior to, the bulky battleships as a war-time asset, and.France today
, has the most powerful and best equipped air. force. England cannot
tolerate . France’s dictating, simply because France has. the air-fleet
strength. England wants to ruin France’s credit so that Francb will be
compelled to stop building the aeroplanes; England, then, will step in
‘ and occupy the position France does now. Just a bit of the old English
diplomacy.	-	: ’ '	/
, The future world’dominance of the United States is merely'a fan-
x tastic dream of Russell’s—probably done for effect. Americans never
could, hope to-become the leaders of the world, and would not want to
be; but even, if they did want to, they would not attain the leadership
by lending their, money.' . ...	’	,	/	/
This is so, because for every dollar that would be lent, that dollar
or the equivalent plus interest, would have to be paid back. In most
every instance it is not the dollar plus the interest that would be paid
back, but, it would be the equivalent of the dollar plus the interest,—or
merchandise of all kinds. Naturally, if we continue lending and expect
• the debts to be paid, we will, in time, be doing nothing but importing
from dur debtors to help them meet their obligations. And while we
are'enabling them to pay off their debts,-we will be aiding them to re-
vive their industries, and to compete with us in foreign markets at the
expense of freezing out our. own industries at home and abroad.

. cosmologyy but in the manner of radio telephonic reception. .
,	.. If what they claim is.true then their new-system will?bririg.i'ii>all
of the modern broadcasting stations' with practically no static or other
: interference.	'	. . ’ ;	' z ,	. •
, - ...In-other words, much of the romance will be taken'out of radio.
There will no longer be the “carrier waves,” which sound like’^cbn-
> glomcration of cat fights'and riveting gangs. The growls, which have
for so long made radio an'elusive thing, will be gbne.from the magnovox;
The device,'the Illinois officials claim, responds only to the modu-
lated frequencies of the voice or music, irregardless of any other wave
; or audiofrequency.	-	.-	(	. ,
- This is a natural outcome of the development of thp science. As
the different sciences are developed much of the romance in them passes.
...But’the.passing of this romance results only from the wider and com-
. ‘ mcrcial use of the radio.. Things in general use can seldom retain-their
■'romantic qualities. J • ,/

N.D. Nine Prepares
for I Hino i s Game
Coach Keogan and his Notre
Dame baseball squad are complet-
ing preparations for two of the
most tasking assignments that have
yet appeared on the local diamond.
Notre Dame will have everything
to gain by keeping up its percent-
age of victories with a win over
Illinois’and St. Viators. T.he Indians?
will be played at Urbana tomorrow
as one of the features of the Illinois
interscholastic meet and the St.
Viators aggregation will be engaged
Saturday afternoon at Kankakee.
Both games will require the be^t
baseball that the Blue and Gold
squad can produce. While Illinois
dropped Iowa on the short end of
a 6 to 4 count this, week the Suck-
ers did not display their best game
. and their fight to keep their slate
clean will be carried through the
week which calls fpr games with
Notre Dame and Wisconsin on two
successive days. Illinois will be oc-
cupied principally with winning
over Wisconsin on Saturday in
order to retain their place at the
• top of the conference league. The
Badger’s win over Michigan this
week indicates a sudden rise in the
effectiveness of the Cardinals. The
Badgers, intense rivalry with Illin-
ois will also complicate the situation
for the Lundymen who are anxious
; to win from Notre Dame, another
member of'the Sucker’s list of an-

WALSH-BADIN GAME TODAY
FEATURES LEAGUE BATTLE.
First place in the Interhall league
will be. decided temporarily when
Badin and Walsh meet on the
Brownson diamond this afternoon.
Walsh is leading the teams at pres-
ent with a perfect record, but a de-
feat by Badin would put it into
second .place. Both squads have
presented strong pitching staffs and
a crew of heavy sluggers. In the
only game played between the In-
terhall teams this week, Corby de-
feated Sorin on the Brownson dia-
mond.
After trailing Sorin for four in-
nings, Corby scored four runs in
the fifth inning to tie the score,
and then added three more in the
sixth giving it a lead which was
too much for. the Corby squad to
overcome, the .final count being 8
to 7. The victory put Corby into
fifth place, while the contest was
Sorin’s fifth consecutive loss.
- The contest, was one of the clos-
est to, be seen this season, the two,
runs scored by the Sorin crew in
the last inning. falling short of a
tie by one point. John McMullen
of Sorin hit the only home run of
the game. .	. <

Notre Dame Meets
M.A.C. Team Next
y -.
The last dual meet on the Notre
Dame track schedule will be run
off against the Michigan Aggies at
Lansing, Saturday afternoon. Coach
Rockne will probably take a large
squad to the Wolverine captial for
the run with the Aggies.
The Wolverine squad staged a
meet with Ames last Saturday in
which the Michigan lads lost by
the overwhelming count of 102 to
24. Coach Rockne does not look
for any strenuous competition from
the Farmers, although Coach Young
has several performers on his squad
that will- make it .an interesting
meet for some of the varsity. Cap-
tain Kennedy will meet Captain
Baguely in the mile run. The
diminutive Aggie miler gave an
impressive showing when the Mich-
igan team appeared On Cartier field
last May. Their dash men are re-
puted to be negotiating the stretch
in' good time although the Layden-
Barr duo will undoubtedly be able
to handle these events in finished
style.’	.
The meet will precede the gigantic
state meet by one week and the
main objective of Coach Rockne
from now until the last event is
run off on Cartier field, May 24,
will be to win the Indiana inter-
collegiate title for the ninth con-
secutive time. The Irish are going
to xbe hard pressed that afternoon
by the .Butler college aggregation

DANNY McGOWAN TRAINS
FOR OLYMPIC TRYOUTS
Danny McGowan ■will leave this
week for Culver where he will be-
gin'training in preparation for the:
amateur trials to be held in Boston,;
the latter part of this month to
determine the personnel, of the
American Olympic boxing team.
McGowan, who is prominent in
boxing circles at the university;
earned the right to enter the trials
by winning the final bout of the
Indiana-Kentucky boxing tourna-
ment at Indianapolis last month,
which was staged to determine who
should represent the two states in
the , respective weight divisions in
the final trials. In view of the fact
that high class competition will be
met in the Boston trials, McGowan
has mapped out a strenuous train-
ing schedule, which the excellent
predictions based on the perform-
gymnasium equipment at the cadet
school will faciliate.
McGowan has given same very
noteworthy exhibitions of boxing in'
the flyweight class, in which division
he won his place in the Boston
trials. The diminutive Notre Dame
arena king, is a fleet footed man
in the ring. He continually em-
ploys his footwork to the best adT
vantage and makes his presence felt

Notre Dame Golfers
Leave for Chicago
- The Notre Dame golf team will
leave this afternoon for the second
game of their 1924 schedule with
- the DePaul University in Chicago
tomorrow. " The Irish squad' will
' meet the Chicagoans on the Edge-
water golf club course.'
The Irish quartet after ;their un-
expected showing against North-
western has made lengthy prepar-
. ationsfor the match with DePaul.
The competition that will be offered
by the Windy City- golfers will be
greater than that of the Purple
since the DePaul quartet is cap-
‘ tained by one of . the leading con-
> tenders, for amateur golf honors in
the country. Dave O’Connor, who
leads the DePaul team has/figured
prominently in Illinois golf-tourna-
ments as well as national compe-
tition. <
Saturday’s match with Loyola is
not expected to task the capabilities
of the Irish squad to any great ex-
tent as the north side collegians
are introducing golf nt Loyola for
the first time this year. - . .

Coach Keogan will have this
psychological complex to work up-
on and the agressiveness of the
Irish on the Urbana diamond will
go far toward deciding the, game
cient rivals.
in favor of, the. visitors from South
Bend. With a, hard game looming
for the following day, with St.
Viators, the mound duties are going
to task the. reserves of; the Irish
pitching staff. .	'	'
Lundgren used two pitchers to'
oust Iowa from the grasp of victory.
Wally Roettger, the Indian ace,
went "wild in the opening frames
and. Iowa pounced upon? him for
three runs. • Kinderman.. who re-
placed Roettger, held the lowans in
check for three innings and when
he' dropped in the eighth; Iowa
came. around with two runs. The
Urbana nine did'not play through
the nine innings without some rag-
ged , fielding creeping into their
work. With Nolan, Prendergrast,
Sheehan and Pearson making up a
tight .infield"for Notre Dame, the
Illini batsmen will, have to" hit
the ball’ hard to get away from the
infielders, but' high drives to the
garden are, as good as out with
Vergara, Dunne and Crowley play- j
ing’up to their usual form.
Lundgren? will have to. conserve
on his pitching staff in order to be
in shape, for the Badgers. Lefty
O’Connor has not yet , taken the
mound , since , his. arm went _out.
Roettger^ who has been receiving
the burden of the, pitching work all
season will, hardly be used against
the Irish if he is to twirl; against
JVisconsin - Saturday. Kinderman,
the! next best choice on the Indian
staff, will in alf probability open
hostilities.	z -
- A hard game is looked for at St.
Viators on Saturday. The second
edition of Notre-Dame will be out
to gain a decision over'the Geogan-
ites. • Their hard hitting and fast
fielding have -thus far. served them
.in.gopd stead, insofar as they , have
not lost- a game. The ; personnel
of.the squad making tjrei“trip was
not' available.,at..press _time.
