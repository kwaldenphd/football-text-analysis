I am happy this morning Ordi-
narily I am not happy in the morn-
ing but today is an exception. Just
when I was afraid that all my
scouts had indulged “not wisely but
too well” during the Christmas holi-
days, and had deserted me entirely,
I received this letter in my mail.
-o- -o-
jfy dear Mr. Grundy:
I had the pleasure of. visiting
your school a short time ago for
the purpose of determining if there
were any men at Notre Dame who
could be induced to undertake with
us a publicity enterprise for our
line of clothing. At the University
I observed many fine examples of
sartorial splendor, who exhibit ex-
ceptionally discriminating taste in
the selection of haberdashery, and,
what is more to my own interest,'
who are so constituted and con-
structed that they can display to
the best advantage the particular
niceties of their apparel. Now’m
purpose in -writing to you is to ask
you your opinion—and this opinion
can either be. your. own. private
opinion, or an opinion gathered from
a contest on the campus—as to the
man who is considered the best-
dressed man at the school.
Two men may be selected, and -we'
are to have final choice between
these ' two. The contest . closes
March 1st. Thanking you ....
, -o- -o-
The’opinion asked for, “your own
private opinion or an opinion gath-
ered from a congest, ” I must leave
up to you. There are a great many
students who, are''not inclined, to
put such confidence in the opinion,
“of Mr. ' Grundy.'. We'shall resort'
therefore to a'contest, in which each
vote cast for a man shallbe.one
vote nearer making a model man
of him.	'. ,
:	-o- -o-	. ■
Remember, we are competing
with some of the best-dressed uni-
versities,in the country; competition
will/be flashy, and the honor of Old
Notre Dame must be upheld here as
' elsewhere. Send in. your candi-
date’s name—each hall must have
at least a few Kuppenheimer or So-'
ciety Brand devotees, arid for once
we are calling on . them to rally
'round the dressing table, and put
on their garments of brightest hue
-o- -o-
Already, at this early hour, the
news has leaked out that the “Well-
Dressed Man” contest is about to
spring upon an unsuspecting student
body, and already candidates names
have been submitted.
-o- -o-
The first was Gilbert Schaefer,
an example of the quiet, conserva-
tive dresser “who dazzeleth not, but
looketh well”—suave, energetic, re-
sourceful Gilbert therefore receives
the vote from the man who signs
himself “J._A. B.”
-o- .-o-
, The second candidate is none
°ther than , Harry Stuhldreher,
whose visits to the East, West, and
houth this year' with/ the football
earn, gives him an,edge already on
hose who are less acquainted with
he fashions .which are vogue, at

Mah Jongg Popular
in Freshman Hall
■	. '	■	I ■
■ Philadelphia has its Butler, Zion
City boasts Volivia, and Notre Dame
bows at last to Mah-Jongg.
It was during the holidays, while,
prefects slept and doors, moved,
smoothly on newly-oiled hinges,
that the game found its way into
the yearling hall. •
After displacing all inter-room
sports in popularity, it flourishes
like a green bay tree, numbering
scores of subjects from the fresh-
man ranks. Even the campus life
of the student is influenced by the
pastime. In the refectory the hon-
ored custom of requesting food is
no niore; dishes are “punged” and
“chowed” from one end of the table
to the other. A Mah-Jongg book is
indispensible to every student.
Of course the progress of the
craze has not been without opposi-
tiori. The pool and checker frater-
nity has organized against this new
opponent; but the “Yellow Peril”
seems at present to be firmly estab-
lished in the Irish camp. . J .

Chicago Club Makes
Financial Statement
The main business of the meeting
of the Chicago club last night was
the reading of the financial state-
ment ' regarding the Christmas
dance. Both financially and socially
the dance was a success. The treas-
urer announced that at present
there .was more money-in the treas-
ury than at any other time. Much
credit should be giveri to President
Owen Desmond and the members,of
the committee who have made this,

HOCKEY SEXTET
TO MEETMICHIGAN
Wolverines Boast of Strong Sextet;
Team to Make Eastern and
Northern Invasions.
The Notre Dame hockey sextet
will play its first game of the sea-
son when the Irish, meet the fast
Michigan team at Ann Arbor this
afternoon.
The Wolverine university has an
unusually fast hockey team this
year, which boasts of four veterans,
and considering that the Notre
Dame sextet has but one veteran of
last year, the Irish puck chasers are
due for a busy afternoon. _ Lieb
has uncovered several promising
stickmen in the group of freshmen
candidates, but due to the fact that
the game •will be played strictly in
accordance with the varsity ruleing,
the yearling aspirants will not get
a chance to show their wares. (
The probable starting line-up for
this afternoon’s game will- be:
McSorley and, Timmins at the for-
wards, Jimmy Stack at center,
Mouch and Feltes on the defense
and Egan at the goal.	'
Tom Lieb; manager of the team,
desires that students skating on the
lake kindly observe the rule which
prohibits skating on the rink proper.
It is the aim of the managers 'to
keep the boarded arena in the best-
possible condition for games.
The schedule, which .is almost en-
tirely completed, includes some of
the best sextets iri the middle-west
and east.- The team will journey
east to meet the Pittsburg A. C. for
a two-game series on January 18-19
and north to play the fast Minne-
sota outfiet at Minneapolis on -FebT;
ruary 4. Included in' the home
games are Wisconsin, Culver,- Mich-
igan and the I. A. C., of Chicago.
The schedule follows:
Jan.' 18-19—Pittsburg A. C. at
Pittsburg.

Tank Schedule Is Practically Com-

Dates Undecided.
With the announcement from
Coach Goss that final negotiations
have been completed with Indiaria
University for the , appearance . of
the Bloomington tank performers at
South Bend public natatorium on
the night of March 8, the .1924
schedule for the swimming team is
practically completed.
Culver Military Academy., at
Culver, date undecided; Loyola Uni-
versity at Chicago,; date^to be an-
nounced later, and Ft. Wayne Y.
M. C. A. at Ft. Wayne, on Febru-
ary 8, is the present card. Meets
with Armour Tech at Chicago and
Michigan City Y. M. C. A. at Mich-
igan City will be added, if conven-
ient dates can be arranged.
The only home game of the sea-
son, that with Indiana, is the head-
liner of the schedule. The down-
state swimmers have built up a re-
putation among tank followers in
the middle west that will be hard to
rival. This engagement will likely
be the final contest of the year.
Tom Goss, swimming instructor,
also announced that preparations
are being made to hold a wafer car-
nival at either the South Bend “Y”

NOTRE DAME BEATS
KALAMAZOO, 22-21
Kizer Shoots Winning Basket in
Last Minutes of Play; Irish
Basketeers Off-form.
For the second time in two years,
Noble Kizer, guard on the Notre
Dame basketball quintet, scored the
winning basket in the final seconds
of play against the Western State
Normal five, 'which gave the Irish a
22-21 victory over the Kazoo eag-
ers on the “Y” floor last night.
Kizer saved the game for the Irish
last year with a sensational shot -
from the floor as the final whistle
sourided.
Last night’s game with the Kala-
mazoo five, which was featured by
erratic basket shooting, was a see-
saw contest from the start, with
Western State on the long end of
a 13-11 score at the end of the
half. Crowe, Mahoney and Rear-
don registered four field goals and • x
three free throws in the first half,
while the Celery City , cagemen pen-
etrated the Irish defense for six
field goals and one free throw.
The Notre. Dame defense during
the first frame did not function
with the smoothness that was evi-
dent in the Michigan game. The
visitors looked good in the practice
before the game, but during the . -
heat of the struggle displayed an in-
ability to handle the ball to the best •
advantage.
The score was 8-5 in favor of the
Notre Dame five in the middle of the '
first period when Kalamazoo gained ;
the advantage on the toss up. near
the Irish basket and scored on a
clever pass play. 0. Johnson, at
center for the visitors, came,back
in another.jninute-and dropped an-—
.other basket that gave the visitors
a one-point lead. ...
Reardon was fouled and gained
the lead on two successful free
throws.
The Celery City performers were
battling desperately and rushed
into the lead with a pair of field
goals- while Crowe . was siriking a
free throw.
. The Notre Dame five returned in
the second half, tightened its de-
fense and once more topped the
scoring by a free throw, after whict^
both teams began raising the count

This is pretty much like
CLIQUES AND CRITICS
Distance in time or place, they say, makes judgment more sure.
Proverbs on the subject, those about prohpets, enchantments, and so
forth, are many, so that when former Notre'Dame men make remarks
about their alma’mater we are inclined to respect and to consider their
views. According to many graduates, Notre Dame is becoming a. school
of. cliques,, groups that remain aloof .from the rest of the university and
that assume a holier-than-thou air.
Is the allegation true ? In one sense it may be. A growing uni-
versity cannot always be, one in which every man knows every other.
The pleasant democracy of a small school'is not possible in the large.
In the new Notre Dame, groups are inevitable. -The man who does not
•seek human society, says Aristotle, is either a wild beast or a god, but
in the transient four years of college a man’s possible scope of acquaint-
- i ance is limited. .'Education results more from-association than isolation.-
The discussions in Sorin and Corby result in a greater growth of lasting
knowledge than proportionately lengthy lectures in the library or the
Main Building, but no university can be crowded into No. 3 Sorin or
into 236 Corby. Groups are necessary.
But may the groups be called cliques? Certain organizations, lim-
ited in membership^because of efficiency by limitation, have been de-
nounced as cliques. But those -who criticise do not know -that the men
-' : in* that organization ~afe;riot~tlie^same men“'Wlid pal together, t^iat 'th'e'
organization and-its limitations, are .primarily utilitarian. The groups
in the halls, limited as they must necessarily be, are, despite their lim-
itations, democracies. The one great democracy of Notre Dame seems
now to be made up of many democracies—a condition not so desirable,
< but inevitable.	-	’	?,.	■
Perhaps there are a few cliques at Notre Dame, a few. groups of
Pharisees. But it does not seem so to us now at Notre Dame. . Perhaps
the proverbs about distance/and wisdom are not al ways true.
saying that you can know what you
want, and yet not have any concep-
tion of what it is, of that you can
feel the truth but not see it. Pos-
sibly the assertion might be not
incorrectly translated thus: We
sometimes have sentiments which
we cannot clearly put into-words;
or, we often-instinctively approve
or condemn certain things or per-
sons or ideas without, for the time
at least, having any explicit notion
of why we do so. These para-
phrases lend it plausibility. In the
original, we think it merely an epi-
gram which obscures a truth by its
own brilliancy.
There are persons who merely
have opinions about whether the
will or the intellect, the emotions
or the judgment, should guide one
in the conduct of life. JVe have
no opinion on the matter. But we
have a conviction that the head is
above the heart, not merely locally,
but also juridically. And, as Mr.
Bernard Holland says, “the differ-
ence between a more or less strong
opinion and a conviction is like the
difference between an- unmarried
flirtation and an engagement to
marry, or rather a marriage. A
conviction is a married opinion, and
this is a solemn act.” Our opinion
was married long ago—solemnly.
This for the scientists who scorn

But spirit scorns it, and is free.
But. we had scarcely set this
down "when the following passage
from Henry More fell under our
notice: “There is something about
us which knows better what we
would be . at than we ourselves.”
This is less definite, and hence more
tantalizing, but equally unsatisfac-
tory—except. to the dreamers. It

What Others Say
ADVERTISING OUR ADVERTISERS
Every .once in a while the.Daily will run an editorial of this nature
boosting the men in town- who are supporting, publications at Notre
Dame by advertising in them. The Daily is going to do this not only’
because the loyalty of these’merchants demands it, but because the
Daily, in common with all newspapers/ has an education side to it, and.
- - -unfortunately there are still many students in Notre Dame who have to
, be educated to the advantages of patronizing South Bend advertisers. '
. Consider for a moment the? merchant advertising in South Bend.
Have you ever noticed that it. is the same merchants and the same
-professional men who advertise in all the campus publications? What
does this indicate? Would it not seem to show that these:men want your
patronage, that they, are prepared to satisfy your needs, that they con-
sider the Notre Dame trade worth going after-—that they are willing
to give something in return: for your patronage? . . - .
z -Advertising in college publications. is a risky proposition. Re-
turns cannot bd measured in dollars and cents. The merchant or the
professional man advertising can tell. if. his advertising 's getting re-
sults only by your actions, by your co-operation. Jf you are going to
patronize the men in town who “get the, Notre Danie trade even though
we don’t advertise,” you are not playing fair to those men who try to
keep their names and their goods before your eyes all year;
Education is a slow process and the Daily cannot hope to accom-
plish much at the very beginning. It can . only tell you once again the
same old facts—can only ask you' once more to look at conditions fairly
. and squarely, and when you are making your purchases in town tomor-
row, or next week, or at Easter, consider first those men.who make pos-
sible the-Daily, the Juggler, the Dome and the other campus publica-
tions.	.	'	..."

felt. What with one thing and another—with examinations looming up
in the near future, with the memories of the, paths of dalliance still
fresh, and‘with the barge service on the paths of the campus sus-
pended, the student’s point of view is .anything but optimistic; Your-
typical college man cannot be called a Pollyanna; he is not addicted to
rose-colored glasses, although he can usually see the silver lining. '
During the months' of January and February, however, his spirits
. reach their lowest ebb. -; For a period of: about six weeks after the
Christmas vacation the number of those who are'dissatisfied with condi-
tions in general may be estimated at-about ninety-nine per cent of the
enrollment. The -condition is as inevitable as the measles and' is about
as dangerous, for it may be attributed, as well as to anything else, to
the weather. Jlf an army marches, on its stomach, environment and
' weather condition are' big factors in moulding the moral of the college
.student? -	'	*

“What I Expect” is the title of
Mr. Edward Bok’s reply to ques-
tions asked him regarding his Peace
Award. It is published in the Jan-
uary number of the Atlantic Month-
ly and in view of the fact that the
prize-winning peace plan has just
been announced, it is: particularly
seasonable and interesting.
' —o—-
, Poetry: A Magazine of Verse
has announced the following annual
prize awards for 1923:
The Helen. Haire Levinson prize
of $200, for‘. the best work of an
American poet, to-Edwin Arlington
Robinson. Lovers of “Richard
Corey” and . “Clif Klingenhageh”
will heartily agree, with this award.
- The $100 prize, to a. poet, regard-
less of nationality or residence, to
Lola Rudge, for her poemL “The
Fifth Floor Window.”
The award of Mrs. Edith? Rocke-
feller McCormick, “to encourage a
poet,” to/H. Stuart, a young Irish-
man residing in Dublin. , This prize
is also $100. ?
All the prizes were, for. poems
which appeared in Poetry, during
the past year. ?
*—o—',
To complete, the field /of “Out/
lines,” perhaps, the announcement
is made by Brentano’s that they will
publish sometime?this month, “The?
Outline of -the; Theater,” by Oliver
M.' Sayler. “It will deal with' the"
history of the theatre from the days'
of the early Greeks to the present:
day,” says one. announcement. It
is not compulsory,' of course, to
read the. concluding chapters!
“Postscripts,” ? a • collection of
many short .tales, fantasies, poems
and burlesques by O. Henry, hith-
erto unpublished, is one of the
“Books of the Month” brought out
by Harpers. The reputation of O.
Henry has, doubtless suffered dur-,
ing th'e past few years because of
the. publication, through a newspa-
per syndicate, of many of his medi-'
ocre works. “Postscripts” /shows
more discriminating;. editorial judg-
ment than these, however, and is
jnore representative of O. Henry.

TESTING “POSTERITY”
Arthur Brehmer, a 65-year-old
Australian poet, successfully dupli-
cated the brilliant fete of Peter the
Great of Russia by having it an-
nounced that he was dead. '
He remained in hiding for several
days to see or perhaps to read what
was said about him. He found no-
tices of his “death” in the local pa-'
pers along with sketches of his life
and criticisms of his work. He
gleamed with joy as he read-these
accounts. And so he returned to
his study once more with renewed
vigor and encouragement. He was
satisfied that he had learned things
that are usually'impossible for the
average person to know.
Brehmer’s method of . testing “pos-
terity” differed from the one used
by Peter the Great in only a slight
manner. The poet did not mean to
harm any one while the Russian em-
peror deliberately sought to trap
his enemies at a psychological mo-
ment.
But trickery is not always a safe
proposition; it is too much of a
gamble. When., public—opinion is
caught off guard, the incident is not
quickly forgotten; There is a time
and place for everything.. We must
simply be satisfied that in perform-
ing dur mission, whatever it may be,
we have done the best that is in
us—New York U. Daily News.
The Daily Nebraskan has just -
concluded, its “Representative Ne-
braskan” contest, which named, the
ten students at Nebraskan who
were most, representative of the
ideals of the school.

At The Palace
Once upon a time there was an
imaginative little press agent who
dubbed Katherine McDonald “The
American Beauty.” It was a typ-
ical Walter Camp: selection, by
which you may guess that we’re not
so strong for “The American Beau-
ty” as a moving picture actress.
She- is playing this week in a pic-
ture called “Chastity,”, and we
liked her performance this time bet-
ter’ than any other we had seen—
which -comes under the heading of
Faint Praise.
’ Sawyer . and Eddy open the
-vaudeville with a trapeze' act, neat
but not gaudy.. They are, however,
above the average for a first act.
Basil and Keller follow with a
sure-fire comedy skit, that gave us
the impression we had seen it
somewhere before. An- Italian
character of the “Yes We Have No
Bananas” type supplies all the fun.
We thought the Higgins and
Blossom act the best of the show.
These two clever girls are the most
graceful dancers we have seen in
some time. Their costumes are ar-
tistic, and nothing has been spared
to make the act a real headliner.
George Austin Moore isn’t any-
thing ,to write home about. He
comes on the s'tage, calls up a “lit-
tle girlie” from the cash customers,
and the two do a modest turn that
'at no time threatens- to stop the
show.
Aunt Jemima is billed as the
headliner, and she is good if you
are strong for mammy songs. Per-
sonally, we see in them the seeds
of the next ’ civil war. Aunt Je-
mima’s orchestra is good, jand sup-
plies the real feature of the act.—

by seeing the editor-in-chief of the DAILY.
Dear Editor, The DAILY:
Is it egotism or does it come nat-
ural for a man attending college (I
don’t mean alt the men at N. D.)
to think it his special privilege to
raise cain generally wherever he
goes? All universities are like N.
D. in this one respect; most of them
worse off, .but why is it. that there
are- always a few who have to have
a wild time in order to remember
their school days?
Do they really have a good time
or do they merely act the way they
do-to attract attention to them-
selves?
In The Palace .a few days ago a
group of “men” from Notre Dame
made the entire audience disgusted
with them, by their loud talking and
general rumpus throughout the'per-
formance. People paid their money
lo.see the show, but instead, became
the audience of . the group which
did everything in its power to be
the whole show.
What these students’ ideas were I
don’t know, unless they were drunk
with egotism to such an extent that
they wanted every one in the the-
ater to notice them personally—to
know that they were at the show—
to know that they were alive. Well,
I’ll say they were successful. They
felt so good at attracting a little
attention that they did hot rest un-
til the entire theater would know
what a “live, wide-awake, red blood-
ed bunch” they really were.
The boys probably considered
the afternoon a failure because
they did not sing the “Victory
March,” or break a couple of pint
bottles with their Notre Dame
“spirit” concealed in it.
Keep it up boys, you did fine;
it’ll get you there some day (no
telling where)—but next time you
come bring a cage of monkeys with
you; they can make more noise than
you did and it will attract more at-
tention—but don’t act like you did
the last time whatever you do—
you’ll embarrass the monkeys.—M.

January 10.
My dear Gumshoe:
I was somewhat surprised at the
encomium in this morning’s DAILY
relative to “Zaza.” Regarding Miss
Swanson’s capabilities as an actress,
there is room for difference of opin-
ion; there is no quarrelling about
tastes. ‘To say, however, that
“Gloria Swanson finds a- role that
was made, for her alone” does not
reflect much credit upon the object
of your apotheosis.
“Zaza,” as a character, is a gam-
ine of the streets, a music hall star
who throws herself about with ath-
letic anguish, and who expresses
her individuality by fits of tempes-
tuous and unreasoning rage when
she is not . engaged in the unsophis-
ticated pastime of engaging in
catch-as-catch-can bouts "with her
friends. She is by turn kittenish,
as when she. is with Bernard, cat-
tish with .her theatrical associates,
and sap-headedly sentimental when
she discovers that the object of her
amorous attentions is already en-
cumbered with a wife.
The play has been, we learn from
the first sub-title, one of the great
love stories of the past several
years. That a storm of protest was
raised when it was first presented is
well known; Farrar’s interpretation
bf 'the' fole’gbt her into flifficulBes
■with ;• the police, and Mrs. Carter
roused the ire of no less a person
than William Winter when she ap-
peared in.it in 1900. Duse took
the role, but so far as I know, she
did not sing it.
There can be no excuse for “Za-
za” as a play, regardless of the fact
that many of the vulgarisms which
have characterized it in the past
have been removed. It is. one of a
type, usually characterized as “mor-
al lessons,” which are produced by

THE RUB DOWN
By TOM COMAN
Harry Gill, having attained in-
- ternational fame as a track coach
, probably will be chosen one of the
track - mentors for the American
> Olympic track team, that will sail
for France in June to dispute with
the old world the track supremacy
of the globe.
Gill has built up for himself an
enviable reputation., as the head
coach of track at the University of
Illinois, where year after year for
almost two decades, the Illni cinder
artists have been the kings of the
conference track season. Between
Gill and Zuppke, Illinois has made
good in the major college sports.
Dfiring the 19 years of the Gill
regime, Illinois has won 85 per
cent of her dual track meets, indoor
Conference champs six times and
outdoor Conference champs seven
times, and in. all probability turned
out more individual stars than any
of its rivals. Including Harold Os-
r borne, the bespeckled school teacher
. anti record 'breaking high jumper,
sixxmen of the present Illinois team
are potential candidates for the
American. Olympic track team.
While the sporting circles of the
country. are Booming with contro-
versy over the various athletes who
. are declared ineligible for Olympic
competition for various reasons,
■including writing for newspapers
and handing in expense bills that
are a little too high, Ed. Dickerson,
' sporting-editor of the Grand Rapids
Herald picks up the subject in a
' new light and declares Tilden and
Paddock, the objects of controversy,
as being two of the greatest ath-
/ letes developed in the country dur-
ing the past decade. Furthermore,
their presence on the American
Olympic team is imperative if the
United States is to retain -the ath-
letic supremacy of the world;
The writer views the Paddock,
matter almost as a jpiece of idle
dickering that means little.to the
country when the sprint champion-
ship of the world is’ at stake.
Charley Paddock is without doubt,
” the' fastesf”runner the world ~ has
ever known.
Tn dealing with the matter of
.-Tilden writing newspaper articles
and signing his name, the writer
takes into consideration the fact
that certain New York, newspaper-
men are in the habit of writing
newspaper articles and signing the
name of well known men who. are
concerned with the article written.
Perhaps Tilden never saw the ar-
ticles until they came-out in print.
■ 1 However, Tilden has not taken
the trouble to deny the fact that he
- wrote the articles but announced
that he has written for magazines
and newspapers and even has a few
books to his credit on the subject of
tennis. And for those who think
x that Tilden’s articles are bought for
' the value of his name, the tennis
artist says that he wrote for news-
' papers before he ever gained ath-
letic fame on the tennis court.
' Knute K.. Rockne, the brilliant
coach of the Notre Dame football
. team, is vying with biologists in a
matter that might be termed ultra-
scientific. In a speech at a high
> school football banquet in Rock-
ford, Ill., the Irish mentor revealed
the fact that there is a third sex in
the person of the twentieth century
. “cake-eater.” “Cake-eaters” and
“tea-hounds” have been the pet
peeve of Notre Dame’s illustrious
, coach and it goes almost without
- saying that he is the exponent of
•a worthy cause.
Rockne’s speech follows in part:
A little weight, brains and intes-.
. tinal strength are the three most im-
portant things in the make-up of
the football player. Opponents of
football contend that the game is
too rough, but do they remember
that the pioneers of our country
were used to roughing it?
There were no mollycoddles
among them. Most of our leading
universities are infested with a
third sex called “cake-eaters,” who
won’t come out for football or any
other sport. They hang around ho-
tel lobbies and want to earn a mon-
ogram for work on a prom commit-
tee.
; We need football as it is played
today if we are to’ retain the -red
blood we inherited from our fore-
fathers. There’s no need for any-
body to change the rules. I’m not
overbalanced on athletics. Studies
come first of all, but any curriculum
which does not embrace athletics is
unbalanced.
If the cake-eaters continue to in-,
crease, in 1940 the reports of a
football game will be found on the
society page instead of bn the
sport page.
' As an encore to the tremendous
applause, Rockne reviewed the
Notre Dame-Princeton game.
“The game: was played on a fast
field, which gave our fast backs a
chance to show their best. Prince-
ton’s back field played deep waiting
for our much-heralded, forward
pass. My great little quarterback,
Harry Stuhldreher, outguessed
Princeton by opening up with a run-
ning attack, and we1 averaged ten
yards on each play in scoring our
first two touchdowns.- —
“In the third quarter, after ad-
vancing the ball to the two-yard
line, Miller - fumbled and Crum,
Princeton hawk, true to Tiger tradi-
tion, scooped up the ball and raced
for our goal. Miller kept his head
and set out after Crum, who was
running behind a four-man interfer-
ference. Miller, instead of trying
to break through that interference,
.which would have been fatal, went
around the outside and slowed them
down until one of our ends tackled
Crum from behind. . It was the
nicest play of the game.
J “We have a lot- of respect for
Princeton. Their sportsmanship
was the finest we have ever seen
arid everywhere we go we are treat-
ed royally. When the game.. was
over and Princeton had been beaten,
25 to 2, two thousand Princeton
fans in an organized way yelled,
‘Nice work, Notre Dame, we want
you back again next year.’ In my
opinion, Princeton is one of the
greatest schools in the country and
we. are .flattered to go back in
1924.”

exhibition. Something novel in
fancy diving is promised in the per-
formances of Mike Anderburg and
John Terhune, stellar divers of the
Irish pool squad. Many other in-
teresting events are being planned
by the committee in charge of the
carnival. Full particulars will be
published within a few days.
Captain John Weibel spoke briefly
at a meeting of the team in Room
123, Administration- building, yes-
terday noon, on the urgent need
of consistent training and faithful-
ness in following out the practice
schedule as announced by Coach
Goss. He also reminded the mem-
bers of the team that they had the
full support of the Athletic Board,
and were being backed by the stu-
dents better than ever before. In
closing, he announced that the new
equipment ordered by the Athletic
Board would arrive next week.
The practice schedule for- the
members of the team has been com-
pleted. It calls for an inter-team
meet each Wednesday. Practice
will be held for the entire squad
at 4 o’clock on Monday, Tuesday
and Wednesday afternoon at the
South Bend natatorium, and at the
Nore Dame pool at the same .time
on Thursday and. Friday.
Another novel feature that is to
be introduced for the benefit of the
team as well as the entire student
body is the erection in the near fu-
ture of a record board that will be
permanently placed in the tank
house. This board will contain the
latest records in all events ’ per-
formed in the University pool. It
will be' similar to and serve a Tike
purpose as the track record posted
in the gymnasium.
The following is the complete per-
sonnel of the varsity swimmers:
40-yard free style—Weibel, Hal-
ligan, Terhune, McGivney, McGoor-
ty, Alvarez, de la Vergne and.
Baier.
100-yard free style—Weibel, Al-
varez, Halligan, McGivney, Baier.
220-yard free style—Anderburg
and Graves.
40-60 back stroke—Fruitte, Mc-
sinking another basket which head,
ed Notre Dame by one point, Kizer
came through in the pinch and i
added two points to the Irish count i
with only a few seconds to play, !
Notre Dame braced and broke up
all further efforts of the visitors to i
score.
The Notre Dame quintet was off
form last night and missed a great
many shots that would have beat
the Teachers by a much larger
score. The passing and dribbling
did not suffer a great loss of form
but the team work of the Irish did
riot come up to standard, particu-
larly after the brilliant showing the
team made against the Michigan ag-
gregation.
