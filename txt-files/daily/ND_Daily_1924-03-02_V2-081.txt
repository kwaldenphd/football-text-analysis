haps you have'noticed the sleep-

follow some dances. It almost goes

one thing: Mr. Grundy is more or

1 It was stated in Saturday’s issue
of The DAILY that “Professor and
Mrs. Northcott are going to occupy
‘The Lilacs’ . . . . ” This story
was ■ incorrect insofar: as Mr. and

CORRECTION OF STORY
ON COGGESHALL LECTURE
The • following is' the correct
story of the lecture of Mr. Cogge-
shall, famous paleontologist, whose
talk in Washington" hall, Friday
night was incorrectly reported in
the Saturday issue of The DAILY:
Arthur • Coggeshall, paleontol-
ogist from Carnegie museum, ad-
dressed, the student body.'of the
University in Washington) hall Fri-
day night. His lecture;'which was
illustrated by motion pictures and
colored slides, was a discussion of
the. process of unearthing the skele-
tons of the prehistoric Tyrannasau-
rus and other animals of the dino-
surian tribe. •
•' Mr. Coggeshall’s purpose in de-
livering his lecture is said to have
been" to impress upon'the minds of
his hearers that the skeletons dis-
played^ in museums are not arti-
ficial, but are actually the bones of
prehistoric animals. ; He .empha-
sized the difficulty of digging, relics
and transporting them to the mu-
seum.-' ■	■
- The motion pictures showed the
process, of'locating and unearthing
the skeletons.; He stated that blast-
ing was often necessary to remove
the fosils.' Some interesting scenes
showed the activities of. the prehis-
toric animals in their natural sur-
roundings. Small models, he ex-
plained, were used in the. filming of
these pictures. / ,	./
Mr. Goggeshall pointed out that
many of the animals were carniver-
ous and, lived for the .most, part in
the /water.; Some of the skeletons,
he said, were found even at high
altitudes in . the mountains. In
these cases,, however, .the excava-
’Inolfc^bruug^Tti^light^f^
rivers - had .‘once flowed-., through
those regions." "	" ..
' He related.the story of. one ani-
mal of former times which had fal-.
len into a crevice of the ice in Si-:
beria near Petrograd, ~ probably
soon after feeding; and had become
frozen fast. Ice accumulated, and
the animal was kept packed in ice
for years.’ When it was discovered,
the animal’s flesh was found to be

KALAMAZOO, 33-23
Crowe and Kizer Star as Notre
Dame Annexes Victory
Teachers Give Battle.
KALAMAZOO, Mich., March 1.
—The Notre Dame basketball quin-
tet registered another win over the
Western State Normal school last
night, when the Maylmen polished
off the teachers, 33-23, on the Kal-
amazoo court.
Crowe and Kizer were the scor-
ing aces on the Irish line-up and
due to the effectiveness of both
men in the first and second halves,
the teachers were kept from jump-
ing into the lead. The Normals
got off to a good start when Beebe
registered the first counter of 'the
game, but Crowe soon headed the
narrow lead and from then on the
Irish were never headed.
Western State tied the count in
the. middle of the first frame, but
due! to the work of Kizer and En-
right, the Maylmen held a 21-14
score at the half time.
The second frame was a terrific
battle for-the lead, and the teach-
ers put up a desperate; fight, but
the Irish were not to, be denied the?
game, and three baskets by Kizer
put the game on' the ice for the
Hoosiers. /	! •

will glow	■

The Genuine Gentleman
Most students can trace their
first acquaintance with John Henry
Newman to a high school text book
on English composition. In such
a ;book is often quoted Newman’s
celebrated description-of a “gentle-
man” —“one who never needlessly
inflicts pain”—usually exemplify-
some phase of descriptive discourse.
The student immediately becomes
enamored with this enticing person
there described. and forthwith
makes a mental resolution to pat-
tern himself after it. This conduct
is only reasonable, for the ideas set
forth in this description. are so
beautifully worded and its struc-
ture so perfectly arranged that it
has charms for the unlettered as
well as for the cultured.
Nevertheless this quotation .. has
worked a grave injustice on. New-
man. . When quoted alone it.delib-
eratly misrepresents Newman’s real
judgment of what constitutes a
gentleman. Newman here described
the type of gentleman which is -the
product of culture alone, /without
underlying religious principles. We
can not discover Newman’s true
feeling on the ideal gentleman un-
less this oft-repeated description is
studied in its context. It must be.
read in. the complete discourse; of
which it is only a small part.
It js wellJto. learn, just .what-.New-,
man’s ideal of a.gentleman ,’wasj for
today it is evident that the world
MEN OR MACHINES? WHICH?
The sixty-second annual convention of the National Educational
Association including teachers from all over the United States, ■ ended
Thursday by unanimously indorsing the Sterling-Reed bill, now before
Congress. This action is ominous. •/	'	.
It is natural that an association of school teachers would favor a
bill that would appropriate-a-federal subsidy of $100,000,000 toward
education^ especially, as the Chicago Tribune points out, since “it prom-
ises to give one of them a place in the. President’s cabinet, with a great
array of bureaus and minor departments under his command.’’ But it
is. hard to understand why so many private school heads would so en-
danger their schools, hard to understand the unanimous—and influ-
ential—vote. '
The general tendency of recent-politics seems to be toward cen-
tralization of authority, standardization, and its. accompaniment,' cen7
-ti-alized<graft. In addition to the already many means of graft, the
Sterling-Reed bill provides a new^means. Education is,-of course,’
worth paying for, but no wise man pays custom-made prices for stan-
dardized articles, while the seller smiles and pockets a mighty share
for himself. The new bill is intended to raise all education to a high
level; it will instead, government history shows, reduce all to the. lowest
level. - If this new form of government paternalism is favored we may
expect as the next step, the passage of a bill that will assure stan-
dardized mediocrity,— a bill that will not only demand that children go
to school, but demand that they go to designated schools, and study
designated subjects.	•	. .	-	.	: . .
More standardization wilb'ihake men even more like machines—
subject more to their nefarious and^ multifarious /.self-imposed, klaws..
Under the restraint of the-.growing, legions -.of- laws sman : may—the
statement may not, in several years, seem hyperbolical or. foolish—
cease to be individuals, and, almost cease to be men. : ; ;
The private schools, Catholic and others, are America’s real edu-
cational institutions. As they are how constituted they recognize a
man to be a man, and not a machine. They realize that men are not
all alike, and they afford the best opportunity for a student to develop
his individuality and become, the best kind of man he can, instead of
like all other men, all on a common level.
With this bill we must; begin to .-pat'-paternalism soundly on the
head. Some of it is necessary,. but the too much we: already have, is
* enough. . ’	.	'
TIME TO GET BUSY
The increasing cost of coal and lumber, founded on the economic
problem of. supply, should turn the average man’s attention to the re-
cent statement by an officer in the United States reclaimation service
to the effect that barely one-eighth of the water power in the United
States is now being utilized.	. ,	•	‘
This means 'that hundreds of thousands of dollars are being
wasted in power-producing. fuels each day that might be saved. It
means that nature’s great warehouses of coal and oils are being de-
pleted unnecessarily.:	-
The theory has been advanced that it will. be time enough to de-
velop the water .power resources of the nation into usable electricity
when the present sources of fuels give out. To do so would be to
cheat posterity of many conveniences which can be had only by use of
these fuels at the will of a,present generation too negligent to apply
other forces to present-day uses.	' '
The. scope of this problem can be realized no easier than to note
this official’s statement: r	'
‘In this new world of electrified industry water power is to play
an important part. It will last forever. Its use will greatly prolong
the life of our mineral fuel deposits. It saves labor in the generation
of electricity. Only a fraction of it (some 13 .1-2 per cent) has been
( developed/ much of that under federal control. The great bulk of Hie
remainder, by reason of the principles of the law of water, has not
passed over from the public ^domain into unrestricted private owner-
ship, and 85 per cent of that remainder, say 29,000,000 horsepower/ is
within federal jurisdiction.” .
The federal act passed in 1920 is a comprehensive national docu-
ment, but unless it is backed up by action in the various states it will
not be effective. Some far-seeing politician will be able to ride into'
, office on a plank of water-power tliis fall.' .
What Others Say
Where the Student May Gain,
Shakespeare is credited with the
admonition, “Wisdom to gold pre-
fer.” Throughout the' ages, philos-
ophers have ..put. forth the idea that
Ito acquire knowledge is the- most
profitable end toward which man
can strive. With faith in the phil-
osophy of the sages, and conceding
the value of all learning in general,
a concrete problem is to be faced
concerning . the education of the
present1 generation, and more spe-
cifically that of the-college student,
of today. The COLLEGIAN has
discussed this matter before but
feels that attention cannot be
brought to bear too pointedly upon,
the subject.	'	:
Dr. Stratton D. Brooks, president
of the University, of Missouri,, re-
cently made it clear' that the ma-
terialistic . dividends accruing from
a university education are secon-
dary to the loftier, idealistic berie-
fits of the community. He said,
“To establish ideals of conduct, to
create an appreciation of commun-
ity responsibility, ..to develop the
power and the desire to think wise-
ly about the complex profileiris of
state' and nation, - and to cultivate
the ability to express ideas, effect-
ively for the forwarding of his own
business and the . improvement of
community . conditions—all ' these
elements are' rio less the business of
the university than is the" perfect-
ing of. a man in;the arts of his busi-
ness or profession.”/ ’	’
However, regardless of what is
the structure of student - curricu-
lum, the opportunity is at hand for
a valuable and' necessary addition
to under-graduate education in the
form of better daily newspapers and
other records of current events.
When college, students can not
name'the governor of their state
or speak as intelligently upon ev-
eryday government affairs of state,
and nation as they can upon the lat-
est novel or the merits of certain
actresses and actors; when college
professors do not know the differ-
places a far greater value on out-
ward appearances and disregards
the interior condition of the spirit
so long as it is obscured by engag-
ing exterior charms.’
The real gentleman, to Newman’s
mind, was one. who possessed the
outward graces with the added gift
of Christianity. ' His ideal gentle-
riian was one with a cultured intel-
lect, delicate taste,, candid mind,
noble and courteous bearing, but
with all these built upon the firm
rock of the Christian faith.
This ideal gentleman of New-
man’s should be our aspiration to
imitate. Some may' say that such
a character is. purely visionary arid
no one of flesh and blood could
hope to equal it. Yet an ' ideal
seems always above our reach; and
therein ’ lies its attraction. Few
men indeed have ever realized com-
pletely an ideal, and those that did
continued on after another.
Because we are Christians it does
not'necessarily: follow that we are
geritlemen. “The Church, aims at
regenerating the very depth of'the
heart,” says Newman and conse-
quently has little concern with out-
ward appearances. Yet this out-
ward culture, which is a necessary
attribute of the gentleman, can be
constructed on the firm bed; of Re-
ligion; and the result is the produc
tidri. of Newman’s ideal—the genu-
ine gentleman.

Broadmindedness
For Catholics and Masons to sit
down to a banquet and spend a
pleasant evening with the spirit of
good fellowship pervading the at-
mosphere is an uncommon occur-
rance. This recently, took place at
Ohio State University. A joint
banquet is held every year.
•Such fellowship brought about by
college training accomplishes a
great deal for these men. They
have been broadened. Although
followers of different religious
faiths they respect each other’s be-
liefs and mingle together with kind-
ly toleration.
The Lantern made this comment:
“Toleration is one of the great-
est traits a mari can possess. It is
the basis for all democracy and
freedom. It is religion. An intol-
erant Protestant is not a good Prot-
estant. An intolerant Catholic is
not a good Catholic. Nor is an in- >
tolerant Jew a good Jew.”—“The,
DePauw.”

Editor, THE DAILY:
• I have not been at Notre Dame
for the proverbial hundred years;
yet indeed do I find it hard to mas-
ticate some, of the examples my
“elders” set. I refer in particular
to these cushion clowns that con-
gregate wherever. a merciful man-
agement places a lounge; or, if the
management be parsimonious or
not able to afford a lounge, wher-
ever it places a smoking stand.
What might these posers be?
Adonises bound into boredom by a
' freakish civilization? Clothes mod-
' els with everything but the wax
faces? Prohibition agents in dis-
guise? Or be they but common
dunces, come to college to test the
resiliency of downtown couches?
Whatever they be, I distrust their
airs, .their “sang-froid,” their
cliquishness.
Since parking my grip at good
old Notre Dame I have come to be-
lieve that under the Dome is bred
a splend(id race of “he-men,” a
group that worships neither clothes
nor money, neither fads nor faces.
On the whole my fondest dreams
have surely been borne out—this
. is NOT a school of snobs; this is
NOT a school of snibbers; this IS
a school of big-hearted “he-men,”
who don’t give a continental if a
man looks graceful drooped over a
davenport; neither do they twiddle
over a Brooks Model.or a Langrock
Lounger.
If now it comes to a question of
either having divan dunces or not
having hotels, I say DO AWAY'
WITH THE HOTELS..
Sincerely,
G. K.

White, outside of' athletics, society
and hooch, never touches the stu-
dent. He is a stranger to academic
life—“as isolated and remote as
the wild savage of the forest from
all that wfcnt with the- cloistered
life, of our old American collegiate
tradition.”
According to Mr. White the only
good that can come out of a col-
lege . education for such a student
is that it possibly might decrease
the sales of the Cosmopolitan and
Picture magazines. — The Daily
Maroon, Chicago.
Yellow oilskin coats among the
feminine members of the University
of Cincinnati caused quite a sensa-
tion when they first appeared. To
hasten their sale, an enterprising
clerk hired two popular .girls, to
wear specimens of these fisherman
coats, and now they are all over the
campus. Another even more am-
bitious young salesman is attempt-
ing to introduce yellow knee boots.

NOTRE DAME DAILY.
Sunday, March1 2, 1924.
ON THE LEVEL
There is but Tittle doubt that
Benny Leonard, champion of the
lightweight mitt-slingers, is the
cleverest and most scientific man in
the ring today. Leonard, whose
real' name is' Benjamin Leinert, as-
cended to the throne in 1917 when
he won the title from Freddy
Welsh. During the six years that
Leonard has been champion, he has
met and defeated every worthy op-
ponent in the 135-pound division.
Today, Leonard stands the undis-
puted champ, and. his crown is no
way near being..in jeopardy. ,	:
The logical contender for a tilt
with Leonard is Lew Tendler. The
Philadelphia southpaw has success-
fully disposed of all his challengers,
and he is in line for a battle with
Leonard. Tendler’s strongest claim
to a fight with the champion is his
decisive victory.over Pinkey Mitch-
ell several weeks ago. When Leon-
ard and Tendler meet, the fight will
be a repetitionJ of the Jersey City
meeting some months ago.
stand still and some of our champs
wouldn’t be able to touch them! .
Kid Lavinge, who was lightweight
champion between 1899 and 1902/
stood on a handkerchief for two
rounds and his opponent was. un-
able to register a single blow
against Lavigne’s body.	’
. “Phewrocious” Fred Fulton is at-
tempting a' come-back. The- former
Minneapolis plasterer thinks that he
can annex the crown that now rests
on JackDempsey’s head. Fred
knowns. only .too well , that Dempsey
. will take him into camp within a
few rounds if the two meet again,
' and he knows that he is in for the
losOr’s end of the purse. Before
Dempsey won the title he knocked.
Fulton into oblivion in 23 seconds
. at Newark. Fulton then darkened
his fairly good record by claiming
that he threw the fight. Fulton has
a score to settle with Dempsey and
perhaps it would not be advisable
for.him to agree to meet the cham-
pion.	;
. Fred Fulton has every, quality of
a champion with one exception—Jie.
K hasn’t the . heart. . He possesses a
. splendid build, knows how to pro-
tect himself, how .to size up his
man, he has gpod footwork and has
the punch—but he lacks that essen-
’ tial; ingredient, the nerve.' /Fred
has proved by . his ^actions That -he -is
. yellow.
When “Battling” Nelson and Joe
Gans fought at Goldfield/ Nevada,
in 1906, the ..gate . receipts were
$69,715., This broke all previous
gate receipt records and the en-
tire . country wondered. Tex Rick-
ard had entered ..the promoting
game. When “Young” Corbett
and ‘.‘Terrible Terry” . McGovern
battled in 1903, $20,000' was real-
ized and this was considered an
enormous sum. The fight between
Willard and. Johnson at Havana.in
1915 drew $60,000, and this, too,
was considered an egregious
amount.
The .gate receipts at Jack Demp-
sey’s training camp exceeded the
amounts that champions used to get
for fighting 50 and 60 rounds.
John L. Sullivan land Jake Kilrain
fought 72 rounds in Louisiana in
the late eighties and neither re-
ceived a dime. Present-day chamr
pions are allowed more; for tun-
ing expenses than former cham-
pions received for-. their titular
bouts. • William Harrison Dempsey
will probably get $500,000 as his
end of the purse in his .next fight/
Footwork is one of the chief as-
sets, of a boxer., Benny \Leonard
,J advises that al! young boxers should
pay a great deal of attention to
their legs and develop speed in
them. This is true, but there have
been men in the hemped arena who

day-champions without any;. foot-

It is not frequent that you find
a man who has an aesthetic sense
as well as a football sense, although
we f requently'find men who are ex-
perts in more than one field.
The god of the -University of Illi-
nois sporting world is an artist of
no little merit, Robert Carl Zuppkel
“Zupp” is synonymous with the
word football, but you would never
think so if you were to enter the
Chicago Art Institute and see there
several striking marines.
.Zuppke’s rise to the height, of-a
great, football coach • is phenomenal
considering;; the' fact; that he -never
played oh a college football team
to the extent that all of our leadr
ingj football'coaches h , When
“Zupp” reported for .football at
Wisconsin in 1901, he was informed
by the coach that he was too small,
since those were the days bf brawn,
and' nothing but brawn. Zuppke
stuck with the Badger squad- for
three years aS a substitute and dur-
ing that time, he.,acquired a “few”
bumps. .. , , ; .......	,
Zuppke came to Illinois 12 years
ago, after spending his apprentice-
ship at Muskegon..high school and
Oak Park, where' the flower of his
later success began to bloom. His
first contract at the. Sucker uni-
versity, called for three years’ ser-
vice, and during those years, Bob
produced two: championship teams.
Zuppke and Rockne are alike in
that both mentors .firmly believe in
the- application. - of , psychology.
Zuppke is a stern taskmaster and
even injuries,, to his .players, it is
said, arouse no sympathy in him.
But because of his preponderance
of influence. over the men, they
revere him with, no little demotion.
Zuppke’s .knowledge of human na-
ture has been one of his greatest
aids in shaping the teams that have
brought championships to the uni-
versity.,	’
Zuppke at .’one time appreciated
the value of color on the gridiron
in attracting the indirect sight to
such1 an extent that he employed
bright yellow jerseys.r But during
the past few years, - he has found
another use offcolor. He now garbs
his .men: in blue in order to make
his proteges look much lighter than
they really are.	/
Another interesting phase of the
Zuppke coaching system is the fact
that he stresses the use of rythm
in -the half backs’ running, • thus
relating dancing to football. How
other coaches. accept this theory
we will not attempt to ascertain
here, but. it is well known that
many realize ’ theimportance of
rythmatical/ movements - jin all
branches of''.athletics. - , //	■?
/ Zuppke spends the'winter months
in complete '■ rest and . employes
much' of his . time in.; painting.
“Zupp” will be back in the confer-
ence; race next fall with a new line
pf scientific plays : for ■ the Urbana
Suckers and another championship
will be very acceptable to him. ' j,
IRISH DEFEAT
AGGIES, 23-21
Kizer Drops in Winning Basket in
Last Few Minutes
.//. of Play
The Notre Dame basketball team,
invading Michigan, on a two-game
trip, managed to slip a win over
the Michigan Aggies, 23-21, in the
Aggies’ court at Lansing oh Friday
night. "	. • ‘	'
Noble Kizer once more proved to
be the “old reliable” ;when a 'goal
was needed to snatch the game out
of the fire.' Only a few seconds of
playing. time remained- when/ with
the score tied at 21 jail, the veteran
Irish court performer dropped the
winning.basket.:	’ •
The Aggies exhibited an entirely
different brand of basketball Friday
night than they did when' they ap-
peared in South Bend January 23,
and kept the Irish moving at a ter-
rific pace all during the . game. The
Farmers led at the half, 10-9, and
with the., opening of - the -second
frame they, let loose a shower of
baskets that put them in..what
looked like a comfortable lead.
About, the middle of • the final
period, Enright and Dienhart open-
ed up the fireworks for the visiting
Irish and the Aggies lead was
speedily cut down until the score
stood at 21 all, giving Kizer an op-
portunity to get in his deadly work.
