THE TEAM

SCALP THE SCALPER
Little scalping was noticed last Saturday before the Georgia Tech
game; It is hoped that there will be no reports of scalping before
the Homecoming battle.	. ;	, a
The University plans to deal severely with the man who sells his t
ticket for more than its face value. Not only will the man be liable j
to expulsion from the University, but' he also will be: liable to; civil
action. The University can punish a man no more severely for any,
other offense.	.	• <
.The character of the punishment;,indicates the attitude of the
University toward the man who would commercialize ah intercollegiate
contest, the man who cares more for clinking silver; than'for honor; /
/ Reporting cases of scalping is a duty, for the University student.
He must make certain that the Blue and. Gold is not stained by the
disgrace of scalping. .	/	■ ;

Its brilliancy is increasd. Notre Dame is happy, for ■ again her sons
have gathered-about. her../ The-men of Notre .Dame _are_Jiqme,_ -; "_
The number of old boys who have returned is a solemn manifesta-
tion that home can never be transferred. «The place is consecrated’ by
maternal love; by joys, pleasures, and frolicsome acts of college days; ,
and by the first acquaintance of the mind and heart with nature and the
problems, of life. Peace of mind and rest of heart are complete.,'. Man :
can find no sweeter spot on earth than home, for, after all, the friends
and associates of home are dearer than all the world. . There, is .magic
in the word; it is a mystic circle, that takes within its boundary,^com-
forts and virtues which are not known beyond its limits.,	1
Notre Dame always welcomes the sons who have left her. . Today,
however, she makes an effort to extend a friendly hand a little farther
and to tighten the-handclasp just a bit. ; Men of the past,'you are as
much a part of Notre Dame today,. and everyday, as you ever were.’
You are a vital; part of the organism.1 When you wander ' about1 the
- campus through halls reviving your memories of the old school; when
you watch that glorious team which is so proud to uphold tlie traditions
of Notre Dame; when the aroma from the “big and beefy,barbecue”:
fills you with the delicious home-spirit; know that there is an emanation
of genuine, hospitality from the heart of each Notre Dame man, which
cannot be-described but which is always felt. •. The warm; feeling in?
every heart is written upon very face. Notre Dame wants you to feel
, at home. ■■ •	'•	'•• , ;	.• ’■ ..

THE UNIVERSITIES AND PRO-
HIBITION
• The following editorial was run
in The Topeka, Capital this morn-
ing. . Chancellor Lindley comments
upon it in an interview on another
' . page of the Kansan:	. /	1: •
In/the compact between Presi-
dent Coolidge and the governors 'to
combine for enforcement of prohi-
bition, the president summoned the
people generally, the press, and; the
schools to join in: this cooperative
effort^to make law respectable and
- respected in the United States. ? In
many cities where. prohibition. en-
forcement has -been ^farcical/ the
newspapers have not.taken the, po-
sition that the law should be re-
pealed; but have asserted that it
should be enforced. In Chicago
- the only paper, against, enforcement
is the Tribune. ..In . Detroit;, New
York, Philadelphia and other, large
, r cities/the newspapers in .the main
stand for enforcement-of'the law. ?
: So far as schools, are concerned,
state universities , . at least, should
take their, stand; on this issue of
. government, and-where they do not
voluntarily . do, so legislators should
make this attitude compulsory.. The
z -Capital the/other day commented

plea to the alumni and .students of
Yale University to take, an aggres- ;
sive position for enforcement of,the i
law, and -President Angell' notified
the student body - that drinking at :
Yale would now be a cause for sum-
mary expulsion. Several hundred
Yale students: were reported to. have
joined in a pledge to .'cut liquor out
and 'obey the law. • ■• -;: •	’	/
•There''should’ -be . no‘d question '
about the attitude of the University
of Kansas, in-view of' the outstand-
ing record! of this • state, as •’ to ' the
18th amendment. 0 ur university
should be out on the firing Tine for
enforcement’ of the law, and1 if
drinking- is not an offense' punish-
able by - dismissal, it ' ought to ' be.
This is'not said.in any' critical spirit
towards the student body,’which.we
believe is'exceptionally law-observ-
ing, nor the b o ard of:' administra-;
tion or faculty of the . university,
which are in full- sympathy- ’with''
law enforcement, but. the standing
of the university would :be improved
if it expressly went"'on' ,r ;in
some such way; and it .would do .its
part in response to; the’ appeal of
the president'1 and' ■ conference’, of
governors’ to strengthen public sen/
timent. ; ;	,	.	: / ■'. ?.

Badin Crushes Frosh
in Fast Game, 18-6
'• Badin crushed. Freshman hall,
18-6, Thursday morning on Cartier
field in a fast game. The Frosh'
threw a scare into Badin by running
the ball to the three-yard line on the
kick-off and scoring in two plays.
Badin tied the score a few minutes
lated when Mouch“ intercepted a
pass and ran, 40 yards for a touch-
down. , , .
In the second half ‘ McQuernj
Badin’s center, scooped up a fum-
ble and ran 20 yards for a touch-
down. Badin then marched steads
ily through the yearlings, but were
held on the one-foot yard line. Rigali
scored, again in the. last quarter by
a wide end run.
Badin and the Day Dogs, are now
the only undefeated teams. The

today free from injuries and primed
to put up a?fight that the Homeconi-'
ing crowd will long remember, as
well as being a reminder to Purdue
that they have ' met;. the:, greatest
team of the 1923 season.
j The game this afternoon' will be
-watched with intense interest by
football critics in conference cir-
cles to.’see’.what kind of a' showing,
the Purdue, aggregation Will make
against. Rockne’s sensational; foot-
ball team that has-surmounted ob-
stacles never.. before - attempted . by
‘any football,.coach.;, Furthermore,
the outcome of today’s struggle, will
mean much’ for Purdue in ..next?
year’s conference race, as the, Boil-
ermakers have a team this year that
will be almost intact at’the opening,
of the season in 1924.. Phelan has
accomplished this year what Rockne
did in 1922, when he built a:wonder
ful team out of the freshmen ranks.
■With Notre Dame’s old rivals, Ne-
braska, next-on the Irish, ^schedule,?
Rockne' will have much to consider
in this afternoon’s game,- since the;
Cornhuskers will have-several-scouts-
in the stands to see just how the-
wizard coach “crushed two great
teams in the East and then .came
