The Northern Indiana section of
the American Chemical society held
its February meeting in Chemistry
hall last night. After a short busi-
ness meeting a discussion of the ap-
plication of chemistry to medicine
was given by Dr. E. H. Volweller.
Dr. Volwciler is chairman of ’.he
“Chemistry of Medical Products
Division of the American Chemical
Society,” editor of the Chicago ।
.Bulletin and is director of the "Ab-
bot Laboratories of Chicago.
He told of the work of the Chem-
ist in securing pure, -active princi-
ples of such substances as the se-
cretions of the ductless glands,
hypnotics, arsenicals and disinfec-
tants. He indicated that many of
our present remedies are results of
the work-of the chemist and it is
the chemical men who are develop-
ing new remedies. The discoveries
of the chemist are not the work of
chance, but are the-result of pains-

Tomorrow evening at 8 o’clock in
Washington hall, the Dramatic club
will present the original play
“Americans,” written by Harry A.
McGuire, and directed by Joseph
Reynolds. The play is a unique '
combination of oratory and debate,
having for its setting the Continen-
tal Congress of 1787.
It treats of the founding and es-
tablishment of the Constitution of
the United States. It is particular-'
ly adapted to the celebration of
the anniversary of George Wash-
ington’s birthday. The Drama club
has expended every effort to make
this All-Notre Dame production the
best of its kind in the history of
the University. The initial per-
| formance will be given tomorrow
afternoon at 2 o’clock in the audi-
torium of St. Mary’s College.
Professor Reynolds and his cast
have worked tirelessly for the last

THE PROM PRICE
The Prom price will be ten dollars.
-This decision has settled a matter of importance to every class that
has hopes of a scintillating Ball or Prom. This decision is in accord
with an S. A. C. ruling made in 1923. It is in opposition to the
apparent wishes of the junior class. It is in accord with the judgment
of most members of the faculty, and is made by the Faculty Dance
Committee. It is in opposition to the ordinary tendency among classes
to try to outdo their predecessors in the matter of the annual class
dance.
The. conflict that resulted in the final decision was unfortunate.
The juniors fought for a twelve-fifty Prom, opposing the dance com-
mittee, the S. A. C. ruling,, and the recent campus sentiment in favor
of moderation in dance costs. The dance committee was possibly ag-
gravated; it prescribed not only a ten dollar Prom, but decided to
regulate how that ten dollars should.be spent. It was the class’ turn
to be indignant; it petitioned; the committee made no change in the
ten-dollar limit, but on reflection it wisely consented to allow the class
to decide how it would apportion its ^expenses.
The committee has finally settled the matter with wisdom, in de-
ciding uponc a;ten dollar Prom.- and allowing . the. class to spend that
money as it pleases.~~Another group that has shown its foresight is the
Senior class, which dropped its Ball price five dollars. It is doubtful if
the seniors showed the same amount of foresight in holding out for an
increased Prom price—-even granted that the increase would have been
small, it showed the class’s tendency to depart from the prevalent
spirit of. “More- Moderation—-Less Money.”
It is said that there is a movement-to squelch big class dances in
the future. The juniors may have given this movement a sword with
which to do battle. If so, it is. regrettable. A class should not be
denied one or possibly two glorious social affairs in its four years of
college life. If there must be cutting, let it be made in the ranks
of the many ordinary dances, some sponsored by classes, most spon-
sored by various organizations. If our dances must be guillotined, let
them be the many mediocre affairs, not the few brilliant ones.
contend with. Theoretically the
“freedom of the press” has been a
great boon to the American news-
paper, but practically our news-
papers have never received the
governmental aid, protection, and
deference that the English govern-
ment, in the last decade, at least,
has given her newspapers. During
the war, for example, many of the
important newspaper men of Eng-
land were given x peerages. This
was certainly a recognition of the
“power of the press.” In this coun-
WASHINGTON’S FLAG
Tomorrow the student body will assemble in Washington Hall to
honor the memory of the first president; and surely that honor.can be
paid in no better way than by a renewed expression of devotion to the
flag for which he sacrificed so much. That is why the Senior class each
year on Washington’s birthday presents to the University an American
flag, and by that presentation solemnly and publicly reaffirms the deter-
mination of its members to love that flag, to defend it, and to strive to
preserve for posterity the blessings which it should guarantee.
And of recent years the flag ceremony on this occasion has become
of greater importance; for there now exists a studied design on the part
of a certain influential group to take that flag from us. This they
would do by placing limitations upon the equality, the liberty, and the
opportunity for which it has always stood. Just as it is true that
tyranny has often acted in the name of liberty, so it is true that this
group, the Klansmen, in the guise of a protector of our flag,, has sought
to make it a standard of bigotry instead of an emblem of freedom.
. That the Klan has sought to appropriate the flag for its own un-
worthy end is made evident by an incident which occurred in a city of
a neighboring state, Illinois. A business man there had placed above
his desk a representation of the flag together with a simple, but pa-
triotic, poem which begins:	-
' “Your flag, and my flag, .	,
And how it waves today !
. In your land and my land,
;	.. ....Andhalfaworldaway.”
. A. visitor, seeing, .the flag and this verses, remarked sneeringly:
“You must be. a Klansman, to have that hanging there!” The business
man, a Protestant who has the utmost contempt for the principles of.
the Klan,, was-very indignant at having membership in that organiza-
tion imputed to him.- But he was more astounded to think that any
intelligent man should so combine the flag and the Klan.
• It is to be hoped that this was an extreme case of ignorance, or
of insincerity; for it would be disheartening to think that public
opinion could be so easily misled by the Klan’s endeavor to. appropriate
the flag for its own purposes.
■ But if public opinion'has viewed passively, this attempt to take
from the American people their.greatest heritage, the Stars and Stripes
' with all that for which they stand, it is just such exercises as are held
here on Washington’s birthday that will remind the public that Old
Glory, the greatest flag on earth, is not the flag of any one group but
. is “your flag and my flag” and the flag of every loyal American.
By DENNIS J. O’NEILL
Adventures in Journalism, Sir Philip
Gibbs. Heinemann; London. 1923.
The chief underlying worth of
this book, by the man who is most
remarkable in journalism for ex-
posing the false claim of Doctor
Cook’s discovery of the north pole,
lies in the fact that it gives to
journalism an international and
universal aspect that Americans too
often overlook. As a rule, we look
upon the profession of the news-
paper man as a thing distinctly
American. We are accustomed to
thinking of journalism in terms of
Park Row much as we look to the
Champs Elysees for the latest
standards of style. This book of
journalistic exploits, however, by
an English arch-journalist, and pub-
lished by an ’ English company,
shows that the growth and influ-
ence of journalism is not confined
to the country in which its growth
and influence have been- the most
phenomenal.
In fact, as much as we might de-
sire to claim journalism as a. sci-
ence that has achieved its greatest
proportions in this country, it must
be admitted that this growth was
rather in spite of obstacles that the
English journalist never had
try such recognition is, of course,
impossible, and as a result the usual
harmony 'that exists between the
English papers and the government
is too often lacking.
Sir Philip Gibbs’ book of remin-
iscences (foi* it is scarcely more
than that) cannot be said to delve
into the international aspect of
journalism, but the mere publica-
tion of a book of this tone and
nature proves that interest in jour-
nalism is becoming universal.

Stephen Crane. A biography by Thom-
as Heer, with an introduction by Joseph
Conrad. New York, Alfred A. Knopf.
This book has more than an in-
troduction by Joseph Conrad to
recommend it. Conrad’s preface,
however, is an intimate sketch of
the friendship between the young
American and himself. Crane was
in England in 1897-98, and these
two men then became close friends.
It was Conrad who helped Crane
raise enough money for his return
to the United States to enlist as a.
soldier in the Spanish war.
Mr. Beer has succeeded in giving
us an honest, painstaking study of
one of the most interesting per-
sonalities that has ever appeared in
American literature. In addition
to that,, it is a perfectly drawn pic-
ture of the times of Stephen Crane.
Men and events are created again
in a vivid manner.
Morons would not be interested
in this book. It is somewhat sav-
age at times. But what of that?
The picture that is produced is a
thing of beauty, which is, after all,
the final test. There. is no senti-
mentalizing over Crane inthe book;
Mr. Beer might easily have fallen
into this fault of most biographers

Bands on Neu) Cups
Are in N.D. Colors
Through the efforts} of Brother
Englebert, 0. S. C., the University’s
buyer, artistic gold-and-blue-band-
ed coffee cups, especially designed
by' Karton Brother Co. of Chicago,
for the Senior refectory, are grad-
ually replacing the more severe
white cups of bygone days.
Coffee will taste better; coffee-
toping will have the semblance of
dining-out with Emily Bates Post
or the Earl of X.
Six months before, when Kar-
ton’s agent cardo, to display his
wares, Brother Englebert con-
cups and ordered fifty dozen to be
ceiyed the idea of gold and blue
made, with the provision that the
first 20 dozen will be introduced
into the “scenery” of the senior
dining hall and the second 20 .doz-
en will belong to the junior “eat-
ery,” leaving ten dozen'for break-
age.
’ When asked how. many dozen
are needed to supply the two halls
and why the cups were being in-
troduced, on the “20-dozen basis,”
Brother . Englebert. said: . “Forty
dozen will- just about supply the
two halls, but, -we have purchased
50 dozen round. Of course, some
of them are still in the making ...
the first 20 dozen were four: or
five months in-the making.” So,
there.will be 600 cups of the school-
colors variety ’put into use this
year. , ..	.
Brother Englebert then . an-
nounced that the University will
soon have- new soup tureens and
tea and.’ coffee pots. And, when’
asked about the relative amount of
dishes smashed , at Notre Dame this
year as compared to ' last :year, the
reverend buyer smiled his .best and
replied: “There is very much, less
breakage since, we have purchased
electric dish washers.”- :

IS what every ambitious senior is
thinking about at the present
time. Life insurance is one of the
best, one of the most desirable, and
one of the most satisfactory as a
permanent calling.
In assets and volume of business,
life insurance is one of the three
leading businesses of this country,
yet the .field is comparatively under-
developed. Only 7 per cent of the
economic value of h uman life in the
United States is covered by insur-
ance.This gives an idea of the big field
still to be worked, especially business
insurance for firms and corporations.

In this picture we confidently

Gloria Swanson, in “The Hum-

We noticed, too, that in the pro-
cession of taxi cabs Papa Joffre
used as troop transports during the
German advance of 1914, were
quite a few U. S. A. Liberty trucks,
that were not' manufactured until
at least two years afterward.
An Apache dance, staged in the
hang-out of the Humming Bird, is
both amusing and realistic. No
wonder that sort of amusement has
never wandered far from the Mont-
martre district; we can’t imagine
that our American girls would de-
rive much joy from that kind of
punishment.

Editor, the DAILY:
The edition of the DAILY for
Sunday, February 17; carried on its
front page a news item that is mis-
leading and incorrect. The article
states that “what is claimed to be
Notre.. Dame’s first course in col-
legiate Astronomy” was started
this semester. For your informa-
tion, I should like to state that “col-
legiate Astronomy” has been taught
at Notre Dame , without interrup-
tion since Prof. A. J. Stace began
the course in 1864, eight years be-
fore the Observatory was built.—

St. Mary9s Girls
to Attend Frolic
At a meeting of the Freshman
Frolic committee last night, it was
announced that permission has
been given to the students of St.
Mary’s College to accept invitations
to the Freshman Frolic. This priv-
ilege has been granted as a. result
of changes in the rules of last year
which permitted the girls to attend
only the three upperclass dances.
The same method of conveying the
girls that was used for the Cotillion
will again be used, the girls meet-
ing their escorts at the Palais Roy-
ale.
The upperclassmen may buy their
tickets -from Joe Ryan in Sorin,
Vergara in Corby, Delaney in Soph-
omore, Della Maria in Badin, and
Corbett in Walsh.

“FLAMING BARRIERS”
Owen McGiveney Visits University;
Praises Art Collections and Democracy
Owen McGiveney, prominent
rapid change artist of the sketch
one-act sketch “Bill Sikes” from
“Oliver Twist,” in which he per-
forms the parts of all the charac-
ters, was a visitor at the University
yesterday. It was at the request of
the Rev. William Carey that Mr.
McGiveney, who has just finished
an engagement at the Palace thea-
ter in South Bend, visited Notre
Dame.
“It is a magnificent institution—
a regular city,” said Mr. McGive-
ney, when interviewed in his dress-
ing room at the theater, yesterday
afternoon. “I have often heard of
Notre Dame,” he continued, “be-
cause of her achievements in the
field of sport, but I never knew just
where it was situated. Aside from
this, I think that the University has
a most extraordinary collection of
paintings, and I have visited prac-
tically all of the best universities
of Europe. In fact, I was very
much surprised to find such a
collection of art treasurer in this
part of the world.”
In referring to his performance
at the local theater, Mr. McGiveney
asserts that the character of Nancy
and not that of Bill Sikes, is the
most difficult to play. This diffi-
culty, he explains, lies in the fact
that he is the only man playing the
part of a female tragedienne. In
presenting the sketch, he is com-
pelled to work under many handi-
caps, he explains. Perfection, he
says, can not be obtained, because
of the lack of concentration, which
it is necessary to secure in playing

the various parts. Then, too, fre-
quently members of his audience
murmur at the impossibility of a
single individual playing the char-
acters in his sketch, although he
has often challenged them to prove
that he has assistance.
While presenting the one-act
sketch, Mr. McGiveney is assisted
by two men. It is not an unusual
thing, according to his story, to
lose several pounds during the per-
iod in which he presents his drama.
Mr. McGiveney, who has ap-
peared in every branch of enter-
tainment but the movies, attributes
his success to the efforts of the
Jesuits, under whom he studied as
a member of the Stonyhurst Col-
lege, England. These men, said the
actor, possess a faculty for devel-
oping any quality that is to be
found in an individual, and it was
at their advice that he took up this
profession. The one-act drama,
“Oliver Twist,” was introduced
by him in 1912 and presented at
the college mentioned.

N.D. TRACKMEN
GO TO ILLINOIS
Yearlings Encounter Culver in
Initial Meet; Speed Merchants
Represented.
Coach Rockne and his Notre
Dame track squad invading the
precincts df championship track
teams, will formally open the Illi-
nois cinder path season when the
Irish encounter the proteges of
Harry Gill in the Armory at Ur-
bana Saturday night.
The Fighting Illini have the ma-
jority of last year’s stars with
which to build a team this year,
and recalling the smart brand ’ of
competition that the Gillman ex-
hibited in the Irish gym last win-
ter, Captain' Paul- Kennedy’s clan
of Fighting Irish will be up against
a tough proposition.
Barr and Layden are going , to
meet some keen competition in the
sprint events from the Ayers-Evans
duo, whov are the past masters of
speed at the Urbana school. The
high hurdle team from the Irish
squad will have to race without the
services of Adam Walsh, whose
track work.has recently been im-
. peded by the lingering effects of a
football injury.
The Illinois school is looking
forward to some interesting track
exhibitions betweri Kennedy and
“Hooley” Hall, of the Illini, in the
mile run, and between. Cox and
the Bruington-Graham duo, of the
Gill clan in the 880-yard run. The
hosts for Saturday’s meet have a
pair of good two-milers.
The squad will leave South Bend
Friday at 2 :50 and will return Sun-
day. ~
' The Notre Dame yearlings will
engage in their first dual meet of
the season when they encounter the
Culver Military Academy track-
sters at Culver next Saturday.
The following men, accompanied
by Tom Lieb, will leave South
Bend at 9 o’clock Saturday morn-
ing: Wilhelm, McCoy, Riley, Mul-
lin, Barron, Prelli, McDonald,
Shields, Masterson, Young, E. Grif-
fin, Dalmage, Judge, Nulty, Boland,
Hanousek, Reilly, Freye, Sullivan,
and Conroy.
league leaders, . Freshman .and
Sophomore, meet. The winner of
this race will undoubtedly gain the

keen competition is anticipated.

outstanding race of the evening
was the Carroll-Sophomore tilt, in
which the proteges of Fr. Gassen-

fastest time recorded this year,
unless Coach Rockne decides to rec-
