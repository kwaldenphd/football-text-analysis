LOMBARDTEAM
OPPOSE IRISH
• . . ■______,__ ✓ .
Schissler’s Squad Fast and Heavy;
Rockmen Ready for Hard
- Game.
The Notre Dame, football team
will face their first real test of-the
1923 season, when they meet the
Lombard College. team from GaleSr
burg, Ill., this afternoon on Cartier
field. Lombard has been pointing
all ..its preparations for this -game
and is coming here with the determ-
ination to win.	.
It will be far from an easy game,
since the two. teams '.are evenly
matched in nearly every depart-
ment. It may even result in a
coaching .battle, before the final
whistle. Lombard is as - heavy as
the Irish and just as fast. They em-
ploy a style of play similar, to the
Rockne systerii, particularly like
the shift. - Previous campaigns have
proven that Lombard is a firm be-
liever in the passing attack arid
then will bring with them an as-
.sortment of. long- pass-players..-- Ab
the Marquette game, it was report-
ed that the -Lombard outfit has a
weak defense on short passes, but
Coach Schissler, has undoubtedly
ironed out his little weakness dur-
ing the last week, since he has be-
come somewhat. better acquainted
with Irish football. Rockne’s re-
serves . were beaten at Galesburg,
34-13, last fall.
. Lombard is apt to vary their
game this afterno.on with place
kicking, and the defense may not
have as easy a time on the receiv-
ing- end. as; i^hey did last week/
when Maher took the kick and/ran
for a touchdown.	.
Lamb, the triple-threat man on
the Lombard squad, riiixed his game
nicely by playing at the end or in
the backfield, whenever necessary
demands him. He gave a strikirig
demonstration of toe work in the
Marquette , practice . tilt. Swan-
son is another of Schissler’s crack
performers.:	'
The visitors will be dressed in red
uniforms, similar to-the suits worn
by Nebraska. Lombard expects to,
bring ,ai large.delegation of rooters.

THE FRESHMAN HANDBOOK.
. With the conclusion of Notre Dame’s second annual “Hello Week,”
it is timely perhaps to comment upon another plan of the S. A. C.
which has a similar end in view. Just as it was discovered that Notre
Dame men were drifting away from the ideal unity'of college' friend-
ship, and “Hello Week” was introduced to correct this tendency, so it
has- been found that many students have little knowledge of the history
and traditions of their school, and the “Freshman Handbook” has been
compiled to place such knowledge within the reach of all students. .
. _ In previous years the new students had to depend upon chance to
fearn from the upper classmen many things about Notre Dame. There
is of course a .unique' satisfaction in acquiring tradition by■ word of
mouth in casual moments. But this satisfaction is more than offset by
the inaccuracies and the incompleteness which must inevitably result
in such, telling and retelling. Thus, in some cases,' students have ac-
quired erroneous ideas about certain traditions; ’in other cases they
.have remained in ignorance, of many interesting and important facts
throughout a great .part, .or eyen. the whole, of their college career.
And becaiise these . students are unacquainted /with^hose- things
that give.our University, its distinctiveness, they have failed to see its
-individuality, as an institution and to appreciate its advantages accord-
ingly. -We cannot, love what, we do not know; and these students, not
knowing their school, could not entertain a deep and sincere sentiment
toward it. ;	.
' In future years, however, by means of their “Handbook” the
freshmen will be enabled to gain much-of this knowledge immediately,
;ahd. consequently should profit to a greater extent from the environ-
ment of Notre Dame. Their attachment to Notre Dame will rest upon
knowledge, and not upon external enthusiasm. The future students of
Notre Dame, therefore, will have reason many 'times to thank the
S. A.C. for its compilation of this valuable little book of information, i

Tri ^booking high-grade chamber music in preference to the prevailing
melo-mania of the varieties. It may be the program designers are tax-
ing-toq.much the taste of the student body. We do riot think so.
' We believe that, in spite of a marked Jtack of vociferation, the tide
of appreciation will rise to sublime heights; for the Washington hail
schedule this year promises the appearance of several, artists of the
first, water. Chatauqua stuff and the .mediocrity of the vaudeville cir-
cuifs will have not place inthe 1923-24 season. Father Carey’s com-
mittee has given the University the best possible within the radius, of
its budget. We doubt that the quality of the divertissement would be
better;if/the student entertainment:committee had had its say., "	;
, "As a. whole, the program is possibly the best that has been sched-
uled for Notre Dame in years. Such engagements as: Alberto Salvi
. and Jesse'Isabel Christian make the program unusual. '
Considering the budget, the program looks to be one of much prom-
ise; 'The finances do not permit the securing of such artists as Rosa
Raisa/ Chaliapin, Titi Ruffo, De. Wolf Hopper, and the Metropolitan
Opera.’stars, but only foolish: persons deplore that fact. •	,	1
Wri suggest that the program be also devoted to the encouragement
< of .local• aspirants. If there is to be ,a Shakespeare revival on the
:campus, if theue is to be a Little Theatre club, a-firsLclass University
orchestra, it will not .be spending everything on professional talent. ;

There flashed on the screen these
words, “The End.” Fooled again.
Hooda got up and started to leave.
He had walked but a few feet when
he heard behind him, “Aha, .my lit-
tle witch, I shall kiss you.” He
galloped for the exit. Another
flirt. ■ He put on more speed. At
the ’ door he risked a backward
glance and then stopped in his
tracks (or slioes) for there on the
stage were two people. It was the
man who had been talking to a girl.
Hooda was quick to grasp (or
clutch) the situation. He had no
sooner got a fair hold on its thorax,
than he began thinking. From then
on it was easy.
“It is play acting,” thought
Hooda. “I will stay and see it, but
I must never tell the folks at
home.” .	.
He. made -for a seat, and after,
setting on a few. laps of braces of
spooners, he decided that the rear,
was too unpleasant, too stinging,
and so went down front.
The play was still going oh.
The girl was young and beauti-
ful. /Watery blue eyes shone out
of a face as expressive as a badly
hacked green. The subtle, carmen
bloom of her cheeks belied the
white streaks in her hair, and the
premature droop of the nose be-
spoke of a healthy outdool life in
the vast wet places. The gentle:
curve of her neck belied the sound-
of her voice. The soft slope of her
shoulders-belied; the .'Einstein the-
ory, while the size of her shoes
made liars of her feet.	.
■ Her gown was sweet and severe,
being of Cannvasse de Tourment,:
plainly done up, or.finished, with:
Lace Au Horrid and trimmed com-j
pletely by a handful of Coloure du;
Shreike, supplemented and offset in;
spots with a wisp of cabbage leave.
In jewelry her taste was simple. A;
single cowbell hung from her neck
and made a pleasant Tinkle de
Grunte with her every cavort.:
. She was immense,-except for the
cowbell—it .made Hooda -homesick.!

Looking over Tuesday’s DAILY,-
I noticed the following/ headline: / i
“Books on Verse by; Christmas.”;
-'Who is this bird Christmas any-‘

be very noisy, that freshihan are:

From Off Stage
Herbert Brennon is responsible
for “The Rustle of Silk,” the screen
version'of Cosmo Hamilton’s story
which is being shown at the Black-
stone this week. Betty Compson is
a lady’s maid who, hungering for
romance, has long worshipped her
mistress’ husband from afar. The
husband, Arthur Fallaray, is a dis-
tinguished member of Parliament,
who, because of his vigorous fight
for the ex-service men, is being
mentioned for Prime Minister. His
wife sues him. for divorce, and Fall-
,aray discovers that he loves Lola,)
the maid. Lola, it would seem, is
a self-sacrificing young woman,
and refuses to mar his career by
marrying him, but promises to wait
until his country no longer needs
All of which leads up to our point
—the reason for this column. From
time to time we will perch ourselves
before the Underwood and click out
a bit of praise or comment. What
might go in the newspaper news
or editorial columns, and does not
get there because of journalistic
practice, will find its way here—
unless, of course, lack bf space or
slips of memory prevent.
The first day’s praise should be
of the Blue Circle.
The Blue Circle, an organization
of picked men, hustlers, has made
the DAILY possible, and only an
ungrateful kind of daily would re-
main dumb in such circumstances.
Coincident with its joy in living,
is its thankfulness to the Blue Cir-
cle, who Enabled it to live.

BAKKER ANNOUNCES
A New One
for Students
barker D-Q—the Note-taker Pen, ^3
Strong metal girdle reinforces cap '
Large ring-end links to note-book
—A pocket-clip if you prefer—-
No extra charge for either	.,
WE asked about 1000 students at sev-
enteen universities and colleges the
kind of pen they wanted. '	‘
The majority preferred the Parker, but
not all could afford to pay the Parker Duo-
fold price. . .
So we set to work and produced this
black beauty—the Parker D.Q.—formed	-
on Duofold’s classic lines and made by the
. same crafts-guild. .
We gave it a 14k gold point tipped with
polished Iridium, and^a good healthy ink
capacity; then we added two things we .
could find oii no other pen of this size be-
. low five dollars—a metal gifdle.to reinforce
the cap; and an extra large ring link to
fasten to . the student’s note-book. These .
features are included free, bra pocket-clip
instead of ring-end. .	.
. The Parker D. Q. is an ink-tight pen. Ask to see .
_ it—note its shapeliness and balance. Try other pens .
too, and see how super-smooth the Parker is in
comparison. ■	■	.	/
