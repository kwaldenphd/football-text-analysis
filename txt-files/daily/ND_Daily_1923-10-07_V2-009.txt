RULESONCUTS
COMMENTED ON
Father O’Donnell Explains Absentee
Regulations a Bit More; See
Profs, He Says.
Attention to sections 9 and 10
of the new .regulation, of class ab-
sences was. called yesterday by Rev.
Hugh O’Donnell, Prefect of Disci-
pline.
Section 9 states that only those
cuts which a student accumulates
while absent in the common interest
of the University shall be cancelled
by the department of discipline. .
.. .According to Father O’Donnell,
students who will be absent because
of, athletic, musical, debating or
other trips in the . interest of the
University need not make applica-
tion for absentee slips. The meth-
od of proceedure will be as follows:
The faculty director of the depart-
ment from which the students are
to be absent ■will notify the prefect
of discipline and he, will in turn in-
form the professors by mail. ■	■
» Section -10 states that every ab-
sence on the last ,day before a re-
cess shall,be penalized by a double
cut.. The word recess shall apply
to Thanksgiving, Christmas and
Easter holidays.	- 1 . '
Father O’Donnell advises all stu-
dents to have the particulars of the
different ’ sections explained by
their instructors so that there may
be no misunderstanding,.	.

IRISH DEFEAT
LOMBARDHERE
SCORE: 1410 0
Rockmen Use Straight Football;
Visitors Open Pass.
' Attack,
• ■ ■ ■ ■ / ■ • . ■ ■ ■ . .
By Thomas Coman.
The Fighting Irish met the test
and defeated Lombard College,
14-0, on Cartier field yesterday aft--
ernoon. The game was a battle of
■wits, speed; one of hard fighting.
Schissler’s squad proved to be every
thing the dopesters had said about
them and gave one of the best dem-
onstrations of heady football seen
on the local gridiron, in 'many sea-
sons. .. .	.
Little Flashy Work. .
The whole battle was fought out
by steady'line plunging, and fast
driving off the ends, that netted
gains of from 5 to 20 yards for
both elevens. Very little of the
spectacular work that featured the
game last week, was to be seen ,
yesterday. In the last quarter,
Lombard threw a scare into the
Irish camp by completing several
passes. Of the ten passes, only five -
failed to be completed. Enright and
L^ayden proved capable of defend-
ing their goal against Lombard’s
last minute attempt to score on the
Irish.	- .
Captain Harvey Brown, playing a
hard, fast game iri the guard posi-
tion, made himself feared by the
opposition by his - terrific tackles,
one of which put Swanson'out of
the game. Brown’s tackling proved
costly to Kalamazoo last week. /
Strong at Center.	A '
Walsh and Kizer were a- stone .
wall at center, but they faced a
stone wall equally as hard, as was
shown when Layden was . stopped
at the line . three times in > order '
when Notre Dame was within scor-
ing distance. Tini Murphy and Nop-
penberger played a steady game on -
the line, Noppenberger making sev- •
eral pretty tackles and recovering
a fumble. Hunsinger and Collins ’
gave, good account of. their posi-
tions on the wings and Vergara
smeared the Lombard backs and
spoiled several runs that started ’
out with perfect interference.
Hauser lost ground in the open-'
ing quarter, when he missed Re-
gan’s pass, but later came through
with some lengthy gains. Hauser’s
first pass was intercepted and net-
ted Lombard 45 yards. The first
period saw Lombard putting all the
fight possible into the game, in an
attempt to. score early. Cerney
crashed the center hard and threw
Murphy . of Lombard . for a loss,
near the close of the period. \
First String In. <
The first string replaced the sec-
ond and let loose all the energy and
fight that had been accumulating
on the benches during the quarter. .
In this period, Brown displayed his
severe tackling qualities and Stange
tried a 50-yard drop kick that fell .
short by 10 yards. The Rockmen
suddenly broke away from the
clinging “Lombard crew and Miller
went through tackle for 31 yards...
Crowley carrying the ball on the
next play,. left his interference in
a. burst of speed that netted him 15 "
yards., The stands were going wild,
and yelling for a touchdown.
Crowley made a brilliant run
through tackle and was hit by five

FACIT, ERGO EST :
/ To be or not to be. -	-	•
-. That is the question to be decided in the cases of-the clubs when
they come before the tribunal of the Students Activities Committee to-
morrow. They must prove that they have a right , to exist or they will
be considered as mythical organizations.
'	/ The S. A. C. should be patted on the back for this move, and pat-
.ted;again if they tap many elubs on the head tomorrow. All of us have
> been clamoring for a clubbing of the clubs7 No one, except a fond par-
ent who was delighted to hear that Frankie' was elected vice-president
of the Round Table or Keeper of Wampum for the Oklahoma Braves,
. thought the dubs meant anything.	s "
; Once upon a time they did. That was when activities at Notre
Dame were few.	<	.	*	•
Now Frankie cannot afford to attend regular meetings of the
. O/klahoma Braves, the Press Club, the Round Table, le Cercle Fran-
cais,: the'Shakespeare club, the Travelers,- and the Tuesday-Thursday
club, all of which/because of his course; he has a: right to belong to. .
- Some of the'organizations existed in order that the club section of
■ The. Dome might be voluminous, that Johnny might show Helen a pic-
ture of’himself as treasurer of. the-Carolinians. The fee for Dome
. pictures last year - caused the ■ temporary - death- of - a - few ■ clubs—but
' only a few.	'	_	-
.Some of the clubs have a purpose. They may form a valuable
adjunct t° class, work. Some of the course, clubs have died jn the last
few years—and tliey are well dead. ,	.	.
"	• But the city and-state clubs, excepting possibly the Rochester,"Chi-
: cago, Toledo, Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, and a few other clubs, are
'	/ foolishly aimless. /	;	. ; t ,	'	-
One club began the. year with plans'for hometown publicity for
. their members—hoping :.to attract more men tb Notre. Dame, bn the
principle'that the publicity would evoke comments: “If Oscar Smith
•is going so well but there, I can become somebody there, too”—and
with plans for organizing the men from their state at Homecoming.
; Good plans. ' Much like these made by other clubs in other years.
. They may be carried out. .	'	. 7	.. .	"
The/S7, A. C. has a pretty problem for tomorrow. They should be
merciless with their slashing bludgeon. " If they make clubs-fight to
live, only .the fittest will survive. ’,	-	'	;	’
“BLOWING AND BOOSTING’
/ This year’s’band has begun well. A drum major has been selected
and the members.of the organization have already, been measured for
-	natty uniforms which will arrive in time for the student trip to Pitts-
. burg. This year the.band men will receive credit for their work and it
'is difficult to see how the organization can fall ,short of a wonderful
\ success. It is a steady :breeze/however, that makes a high wave , high
: and .continued wind will "be necessary to keep the band’s enthusiasm at
top pitch. /	'	: , , ; .	,
> ' There, are<three kinds^of wind at Notre T)ame., JThe first’ is>blown
through-instruments and may be called “educated wind.” Much of
-this is going to waste on the campus; too many instruments are lying
unused in their cases and too many fellows, who should be helping
Professor Parreant/ are depriving /Notre Dame- of a talent that could
not be used, better than in the service of the school. The man who
plays a band instrument and'does not belong to the band, should talk
. , pver the situation with a friend; another viewpoint might be enlight-
■ ening. - ■	.	- • •	■ >•' \
.7	' The’second type of wind, beyond its oxygen-bearing qualities, can
only knock., . This wind belongs to the type of man which' Notre Dame
could do without. If this man cannot do or praise, he does better to
retain his wind which he might use. :	'	.	.
The third type of wind belongs to he who boosts/. Such wind, and
the wind of those who. let it. pass through instruments, is worthwhile.
Such wind makes good-bands, r • :	' ' j. 7 j ~ ; . .	. . '

It is intended as an appeal for the band. . It is intended to urge; every
man who plays an instrument'to lend his talents to €he efforts of those
who have-already made the’band certain of success. .' ” . -

The villain..'(for Hooda guessed
it was he, or perhaps rather, he
guessed that he : was it)—the vil-
lain—but need we describe the vil-
lain? Is the wretch worth it? We
will see.
A man of fairly odd years, he
stood six feet, two and a half inches
from the girl in his stocking feet.
Treachery, perfidy, infidelity, and
profanity, lurked all over his face.
Or rather, treachery, profanity, .and
the other two' (I forget, them)
lurked on a part of his face, while-
bigamy, poverty, and alchemy
squatted on what was left. The
rest of him to the waist line was a
rhapsody of gluttony, and from
there on down to the carpet he was
a parody. In fact, Hooda -decided
that he. looked downright unneigh-
borly. A villain of the blackest.die,
and aU the more so because all the
above marks were completely dis-
guised under the cloak of a frank,
earnest, and gentlemanly young
college chap.,	.
But you couldn’t fool Hooda. He
had read too much to be misled by
exterior appearances.- ••He had seen
too much on -Michigan street to
trust his eyes to any great'extent.

tell you that, as I stood looking at

said to his companion: “This pix--

From Off Stage
Just how much of a fool, is Ed.
Wynn? After witnessing his mus-
ical concoction at the Oliver Fri-
day evening, one is inclined to be-
lieve that the gentleman is anything
but foolish. In the first place, the
' book, lyrics, and music are his own
work, and in . the production, he
works tirelessly. It is hard to' say
wherein the secret of his success
. lies' he does not dance, he does not
sing, as do other comedians. His
. efforts consist for the most part in
giving the audience an idea of what
‘ is not coming next, and in refusing
to hire artists -who come to him
highly recommended by . theatrical
magnates.	...	..
The Wynn opus is good entertain-
ment and it has none of faults nor
, none of the dragging moments
which mar most musical offerings.
Wynn seems to proceed on the
principle that his public should be
- given its money’s worth, and if it
. Joes not get it, he is resolved that
it shall be through no fault of his. .
“The Perfect Fool” is of a uni-
' formly high standard; The prin-
cipals, Flo Newton, True Rice,
'Nydia D’Arnell, Arthur Burckly,
and John Dale sang or danced as
the occasion demanded as if they
had imbibed some of the spirit of
the star. The chorus, the . weak
. ’spot in too many musical comedies
- and revues, is far above the aver-
age. The singingzwas good, and the
dancing showed exceptional train-
" ing.	'

PEN to see -

■ &BIG
four years
- \ /This is a great pen for college
x men and women! It is made by
' the makers of Eversharp pencil.
.	' It has a huge ink capacity ! "And
■ -'	the Wahl filling device fills it plumb
~ full every time. It’s a big pen.
. But it is so nicely balanced , and pro-
portioned that it fits into the fist most
- comfortably.
The Wahl Signature Pen writes the
instant the point touches paper. The
' - . ink begins to flow evenly -— always
. enough, never too much. The pat-
ented comb feedv makes shaking Juh-
necessary.	:
The everlasting niE is a wonder.
Experts say it is the ultimate in .
nib-making. It suits itself to. any
hand—to any style. It is extra
heavy. The14-karat gold is tipped ;
with the hardest and finest grade _
of iridium that money can buy.
The patented j construction of the .
cap makes it impossible for the pen to
leak in the pocket. The cap cannot ,
split, for it is strengthened by the plain
gold band. ' There are two sizes of the .
Wahl Signature. Pen—one ,at $5 for
women, and one at $7 for men! Other ,
Wahl Pens, $2.50 up !

.downed after a 14 yard gain. The
Irish had the/ball . under the Lom-
bard goal posts and Miller came
through with the first score when
~Ke* dove - through -the..line for 12
- yards.	'
The opening of the third quarter,
\ saw some brilliant line plunging on
- the part of both teams. Lombard
defied the hard drives of Layden,
who tried to cross the line on cen-
ter plunges. NotrejDanie was off-
side on the next, play when Layden
went over the line" and the ball was
recalled. Lombard took the ball
z Jon downs. On the next march to
.the Lombard goal, Layden at-
tempted a kick and was hurt on the
play, but he returned to the game.
- For the first time in ‘the game
. Lombard approached the -Notre
; Dame goal line, when it was Lom-
bard’s ball on the Irish 35-yard line.
Miller and Crowley put a final kick
into the game by reeling off two
runs that netted 53 yards. Miller
ipade1 it again for 12 yards and
Stuhldreher went over on a beau-
tiful line charge, that made the final
score 14-0.	-	......
