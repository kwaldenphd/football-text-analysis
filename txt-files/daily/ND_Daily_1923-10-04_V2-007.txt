New Tags May Be Secured at News
Stand; Aluminum Tags Pos-
sible Next Year.
“Although only three days have
passed, ‘Hello'Week’ has already
pretty well served its. purpose,” said
Matt Rothert, chairman of the Blue
Circle, yesterday. He continued:
“The entire year is ‘Hello Week’ at
Notre Dame, but the traditional
demorcatic z spirit that dominates
Notre Dame men is emphasized this
week*.” .	. ’	.....	;
Many students experienced dif-
ficulties with their tags, because the
cards are easily torn. From this
Matt Rothert conceived the idea of
the possible use of. aluminum' tags
next year. Those who have lost
their tags and'whose tags are torn,
may obtain others at the News
Stand..	■ ,

HELLO, NOT HAZING
Hazing was. never popular at Notre Dame; occasionally, a stu-
dent whose ideas and ways of acting were in direct ^opposition to the
.traditions of the University has been waited upon by a committee of
his fellows and has had certain customs and usages explained to him.
But in general, all the classes, from freshmen to senior, have “dwelt
together: in peace and harmony. - - ■ z •	.
It is the purpose of “Hello Week” to make the freshmen feel at
home. A friendly greeting goes a long way. sometimes towards making
life happier; there is no reason why this, greeting should be denied.
In a- true democracy, everyone in,equal,, and Notfe Dame is a true
democracy, if there ever was one. i > . ■ -	\	-
Show that you care a little about the other fellow! Of course,
you will shout “Hello” in passing, but did -you ever thing of going -a
little further. Come out of your shdll,-and start a .conversation. You
might be;surprised at the results, and get an idea or two from him.
And then, did you ever realize that friends are an asset.to a man?
There are close to two thousand Notre Dame men-whom you can
friend if you will.	;

THE DAY STUDENT PROBLEM -
Registration figures show that there are now approximately
day students, or 200 less than there iwere at this time last'year. This
decrease has been brought about through the increased accommodations
on the campus offered by the new Freshmen and' Sophomore halls... *It
is the desire of the University officials to bring all the students to the
campus eventually; and with this end in view the erection of addi-
tional halls next year is being planned. ..	" —

grabbed at it, thinking perhaps she

after her till she was lost from

BLUE CIRCLE. •.	r.
Yet a number of years must pass before, it will be possible to
house on the campus all the students who will seek an”education at
Notre Dame. And in the meantime we have the day student, problem?
This problem lias resulted from the fact that the downtown men
have always been a group set apart too. distinctly from the rest of the
: student body. They have never lived the life that develops the fra-
ternal Notre Dame spirit. And failing to share in the development of
that-spirit, some have even questioned its existence. In a certain
sense, however, they have reason for-their dqubts, for- they have never
ben in a position to observe the nature of the spirit or to be influ-
enced by it. -	.	-	:	: r
One of the chief advantages offered by any university is that, of
contact with other students; and this .has always been a advantage
of great importance at Notre Dame.' But the day students have been
. in a large measure deprived of that advantage. The University has
evolved no plan for joining them more closely to the campus.men, and
the men themselves have apparently given the matter little consid-
eration. ''	. '	.	?	.
;As an organization the off . campus body has always been weak.
Perhaps the strengthening of this organization should-be the first step
. in the program of initiating The day students into Notre Dame’s only
fraternity, that. of. good fellowship. \ By; means of a strengthened or-’
ganization, and possibly by means rof a central recreation center in
South Bend, companionship and' association would be made possible
among the day students. This new mutual interest should then be the
means of leading them as. a group into^a more harmonious participa-
tion in'school activities.	?	.

Piggly Wiggly store, just because
he looked green. Nor' the day his
friends had placed confidence in
him and . sent him in to Hellers’ to
argue about dak. He had been
thrown out hard both times (hard-
er the second time) "but they
had condoned by having their re-

on his head.

and wiles, while, away 'back home
he whiled away his wildest hours
■teasing.-the--family’-s—pet--civefj—a
vicious animal whom none dared
go. near.	.	.
: At last he reached the ticket of-
fice. - It was seven o’clock in the
evening.. “I hope I’m on tinie,” he
thought. It was his first picture
show in- a big town and, he did not
intend to miss it much.
“Sir,”he said, “give me a ticket.”

the window.'
: ‘‘The:—the—(Now what was dt

The ticket man let him in for

And watch the couples fight.”

Then here’s all mine instead?’

SEEKERS OF TRUTH
. Many newspapers are so'given: to lying'and exaggeration that it
seems as. if they made misrepresentation, their policy. .-Lying and.exag?
' geration is profitable. ' The newspapers that distort truth are; success-
ful—they make the money. - ■	/■,/	' ■ ; .	.
But there are newspapers that i make every effort to be truthful.
These are the papers with reputations among people \yho think; these
• papers have power,. _	:
. Even the paper that tries to print the truth, however, sometimes
errs. Sometimes a copy reader, sometimes a reporter is at fault. • < .
-But often men not connected with the newspapers are at fault.
Such men are everywhere—they are at Notre Dame.Siicli men criti-
cize all newspapers, making no distinctions." 'Sometimes such men are
the only^source for a story, but even iso, tliey rebuff the reporter. “I
won’t give you any news; I won’t teil.you^anything;' newspapers never
get things right/’ they say. :	1 >

From Off Stage
Those, who care for the type of
acting of which Mae Murray is the'
chief exponent will, no doubt, en-
joy “The French Doll” at the Or-
pheum in which she is given her
usual opportunity to do plenty of
dancing, and to display her unusual
wardrobe. The vivacious Mae—
she is too vivacious at times—plays
the part of a French girl whose par-
ents regard her as their best finan-
cial’ asset. Her specialty is palming
off large quantities of antique fur-
niture, manufactured in Grand
Rapids, to the various gentlemen
who fall under her spell. When she
is'not selling furniture, she dances.
As a matter of fact, the outstand-
ing fault of the work, is that her
dancing is over-emphasized. She is
clever, but enough is too much. ■

Georgette Heyer is an author of
whom we- have the misfortune to
know little,. but if we may take
“The Great Roxhythe” as a fair
example of her work, there is good
reason to believe that much will be
heard of her in the future.
This historical romance of the
time of Charles II deals with the
diplomatic intrigue of the time
rather than with the gay life at
Whitehall, usually associated’ with
the merry monarch. The leading
figure is-’the enigmatic Lord Rox-
hythe who is in turn a cvnipni
who is in turn a cynical
and a master diplomat to
whom the king intrusts his most
secret missions. He loves only two
things: himself and Charles, and iti
would be difficult to say which holds |

HALLFOOTBALL
SEASON OPENS
Badin Veterans Return; Walsh Has
Heavy Line; Brownson
Opens, Against Walsh.
The 1923 Interhall football sea-
son will be formally opened next
Sunday, October 7, when the first
~ section of' the schedule will be
. played off. A silver loving cup will
; be presented to the hall winning the
campus football title this year, and
to. the members of the champion,
team, individual prizes will be given
, as a tribute to their valiant work
throughout the season.- ■ ' ■
. Interhall athletics during the en-
tire year have always found great
- favor among the students as well as
created n sense of rivalry. Many
of Rockne’s greatest, stars. have
been graduated from the interhall
ranks." George Gipp, without doubt
one of the most brilliant all-time
fullbacks .in football history, was
a wearer of the Brownson colors,
when he first came to Notre Dame.
The . sport writers of the country,
when commenting upon the athletic
system at Notre Dame, always takes
into consideration that .Rockne’s
system is - far reaching enough to
, . give every man at the school, who
: has any tendency whatsoever to-
' ward athletics, a chance to display
his ability. The interhall games ac-
complish this purpose.
'	. Badin hall, winners of last year’s
title, have almost a veteran team in
the field, which is composed of a
heavy line and.a fast, shifty back-
field, although they are minus the.
. services of Bud Gorman, the
. plunging fullback, who won a berth
on the All-Hall last year.
Walsh hall, runners up for the
title last year, have prospects that
look! good for a successful cam-
, - paign this year. ' Londo, Scalero,
and • Stanhope, veterans from the
1922 squad, are back in the .line-
up and’im fine fettle for the open-
ing tilt with Brownson. . Gene
- ; Hauber, 'who rivaled • Gorman .for
• : honor s _ at -fullback last -year, has
■. - returned to- the -backfield-and- will
~ be a powerful addition to the com-
paratively new set of ball-toters
that will perform behind the line
this fall. ;
- Brownson, as usual, got away to
■ am early start, and worked off the
early season slackness in a hard
- < game at Chicago last Sunday.; The
Purple warriors have but-one-vet-
eran returning to the line-up this
year;. but the new material pre-
sent a.rather hefty outfield to the
.other title hopes on the . campus.
’ The Sorin Hall football eleven,
coached by Captain Harvey Brown
of the Varsity, will open its pres-
ent football season next Sunday
whem.it lines up against the Ffesh-
. man hall eleven under direction of

Rockmen Drill for
Lombard: Golf Try
Outs This Week
Scrimmage continued to be the
important phase of this week’s
parctice for the Rockmen on Car-
tier field. As the date for the sec-
ond game draws nearer, Lombard
looms more formidable before the
Irish, who must consider that the
Galesburg outfit is nearly their
equal in weight, possessing a good
punter and hoping to score on the
Irish by means of the aerial attack
made famous by the Blue and. Gold
warriors.	-
If Saturday’s game proves to be
what is expected, Rockne’s wards
will be in splendid fighting trim for
the Army, on the following Satur-
day, when the Irish gridmen clash
with a team of veterans, that is
reputed in prominent sport circles,
to be the strqngest in the East.
In last -night’s scrimmage, x Bbb
LaFollette, right tackle, received a
severe cut over the right- eye while
making a pretty tackle. It required
four stitches to close the wound.
■ Golf Try-Outs. -
At the golf meeting held Tues-
day evening, plans were formulated
to run-off'the qualifying rounds
this week, the results of which will
determine the men who compose
the fall team." The Chain-0’-Lakes
and the Christiana Country club at
Elkhart have been scheduled for
the fall season and the outcome of
these tournaments will serve as a
basis upon which 'to determine the
team that will represent Notre
Dame in: western colege golf cir-
cles,- next spring.	,
For. those who wish to keep in
shape during the winter the use of
Bert Meyering’s indoor course in
South Bend is offered.
George Ward, of Walsh or Jack
Adams of Badin will be .glad to re-
ceive the names of further appli-
cants. -	’	.

HOMECOMING
Championship Bouts on Home-
coming Program; All Stud-
ents Eligible.
Frank Cahill, boxing instructor
at the University, has formulated
plans whereby! championship bouts
in all the weight divisions, will be
staged, November 2, the night be-
fore the Purdue game, as one of the
principal features on the Homecom-
ing program.	.
. Cahill, who is now instructing a
class of 85 aspirant glove wielders,
announces that the University
tournament is open to'all men in
the school, the gym being open
every afternoon when candidates
may work out.
Boxing at Notre Dame gained a
national prominence in amateur
circles during the Chicago Tribune
boxing tournament held last winter.
Edgar “Rip” Miller, varsity foot-
ball tackle, fought his way to the
finalsj only to lose the amateur title
by the margin of a close decision.
Charles Springer, the St. Paul flash,
outpointed a large field in the same
tournament, and won the . light-
heavyweight title. Danny: Mc-
Gowan took all comers on the same
bill and easily copped the flyweight
belt. ,	.
The weights'of all the divisions
are: Flyweight, to 112; Feather-
weight,. 112-118'; Bantamweight,
118-125; Lightweight, 125-135';
Welterweight, 135-145; .Middle-
weight 145-158; Light-heavy-
weight, 158-175, and Heavyweight,
175 and up. The entry list will be
opened next week. ' -
