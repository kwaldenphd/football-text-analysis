Five Hundred Attend
Mu sic a I Operetta
“May Night”, a two-act musical
operetta written and produced by
St. Mary’s^ College Glee club, was
.presented to a capacity audience of
possibly five hundred in St.. Angela’s
hall on the campus of St Mary’s last
night. The production was attend-
ed by students and faculty of St.
Mary’s, a number of guests from
South Bend and many of the fac-
ulty and students of the University.
The . principal members of the
cast were: Misses Frances' La-
Pointe, Ruth Claire Kelly, Cather-
ine Boyle,. Virginia Wathen, Flor-
ence Donahue and Margaret Foster.
The’chorus consisted of six girls
assisted by some -thirty minor char-
acters. ’	-	' .
The . production ’ was enthusiast-
ically received by the large and ap-*
preciatiye audience. . Practically
every number of the program was
encored. Considering that the play
was'entirely produced by students
of the college; “May Night” was an
achievement that ^should reflect
much . credit on the .authoress and
the individual members of the Col-
lege Glee club.

DON MILLER ELECTED
SENIOR PRESIDENT
MERRIMAN IS VICE-PRES-
IDENT; OTHER OFFI- . '
CERS ELECTED
Donald C. Miller,. of Defiance,-
Ohio, gridiron and basketball star,
was elected president' of the 1925
class of the University at a meet-
ing of the Junior class in the li-
brary Thursday noon. Jack W:
Scallan, • of Columbus, Ohio, editor
of the 1924 Dome, was Miller’s op-
ponent. Both men are very pop^
ular and the election was interest-
ing and close.	'	•
William Merriman, Geneva, New
York, was victorious in ’ the; race
for the vice-presidency. The other
candidate for this office was Joseph
Toolen, of Anderson, ! Indiana.
Barney McNabb was chosen secre-
tary. William7 Hurley, Saginaw,
Mich., was elected treasurer; John
Kilkenny ran second in this elec-
tion. '	'
■ ?Miller is probably the most- ver-
satile of Rockne’s proteges. His
performances on the gridiron last
fall rank him as one of the. leading
halfbacks in the country and he
is a basketball player of no mean
ability. ' Miller gained second choice
on Walter Camp’s-mythical selectiori
and many promirient' critics placed
him on ’ their first All-American
elevens last fall.
The president-elect of the class
of ,1925 is a junior in the College
of Law and :he will -^complete his
studies next year.

MAGEVNEY BLANKS
ILLINOIS; 7 TO 0
ILLINOIS JINX DOES. FLIP- '
FLOP AT HANDS OF
IRISH ACE •
URBANA, Ill., May 16 (Special) ~
—-The Illinois jinx did a-flipflop here
this afternoon when, Notre Dame
whitewashed, the Illini, 7 to 0, with
Red Magevney on the mound.’ It
was the first time in years .that the
Irish have defeated Illinois on its
own field at baseball.
Magevney,/ leading hiirler on
George Keogan’s pitching staff, was '
at his best and set the.Illini.hitters
down in order most of-the way. Red
Grange, the football sensation, tried
his hand at hurling against the vis-1
i^ors Lbut was treated?rough7 by the
Irish sluggers. .. . ?u.......
An Early Start.	?
Capt.. Bill Sheehan and his men
went after the game in the very-,
first round; Sheehan, first, man up,
singled over second base and. weht> \
to . second when Frank Crowley sac-
rificed him. George Vergara sent
brie to the outfield but it was
caught. Roger. Nolan then banged
out ..a hit which enabled Sheehan
to scamper home with the” first,
marker.. '	.
; • Magevney . himself took a hand
in -winning the game .in?the second '
when he., cracked out-a long double ,
to center with Pearson and Prerider-
g’rast meandering on the paths.
Passes, sacrifice hits,' arid a couple
of timely bingles figured in the
scoring ;of the other four runs,
which were made orie at a tiirie.
“ ~ “No 'Match 'for/Magevheyr "	'
.Red Grange,, who. hurled his first <
complete game for Illinois, was no-
match for ' the .veteran Magevney.
The Irish flinger- was1 in control of
the situation throughout, Grange’s
triple beirig the only serious dam-
age done during the course of the.
whole melee. -	■■

THE 1924 DOME.
The 1924 Dome is out. Curious seniors have, read their personal
little paragraph, athletes;have glimpsed themselves in exciting moments
of play, dignified professors and [deans have looked over the depart-
ment writeups, and all are pleased. The Dome is out, and on time. It
is a creditable achievement. The Junior class is to be complimented on
the work of its representatives,
z ■ 'THE NEW PRESIDENTS. .
z .7. The three, new .presidents .are . Doh Miller, Dan Brady 'and Tom
Green. Class elections are over i for another year, and the work of
organization is under way. . The new presidents are.remarkably well-
qualified for their positions, and the classes seem'to: have chosen wisely.
In fact^ even in pie. nominations it was apparent that the best; men in
the class were being named, and as a result some very able candidates
, were defeated. On the whole,: however,' there was a healthy indication
• in student politics. The voting system is no longer satisfactory, though,t
• andithe proposed change tp ballot boxes and all-campus elections will be
a great improvement when carried? out by the S. A. C. ' .' ' • ,
’	. HEADS, NOT FISTS ' .	.
An organization formed of men who. do not think deeply nor well
; plans to parade in South Bend this evening, it is reported. Mayor See-
birt.has forbidden them'to parade, says that they will not parade, and
also'asks Notre Dame riiento remain at the university on that evening
so'that possible trouble may be avoided. South. Bend’s officials, he says,
'can handle the situation. Notre-Dame men can accomplish nothing by
'acting contrary to the mayor’s; request; they, may cause serious
. .happenings.	.;	.	:	?
Some children need to be.whipped, but the approved correction is
an appeal to, the growing intellect. The . approved correction is a
. means,'not of administering bruises, that surely, pass with time, but of
impressing/ mental blows that do not pass but remain to germinate.
-Tonight, we are. sure, Notre Dame will give some shallow-minded
, ones an example of respect for law. ' Tonight, Notre Dame men will
•use their heads and not their fists.
SO THIS IS ART!
The New York Times of last Sunday carried a: few lines written by
Rudolph Blumner, a German poet who is either, a fdbl; or a’ clever rogue;
which are alleged to be a poem—-the absolute poemi) pure abstraction^
without message or meaning. This is the “poem”: . v

We recognize one word, toro/which in'Spanish/means “bull.”

an.ink blot on,paper, folds the sheet,.unfolds it/arid.hangs the result in
an art gallery with the title: “Shepherd’s Neckties.” We thing someone

they refuse to recognize a fundamental principle—the existence of per-

HONORING THE GREAT
■ . Men and women who achieve par-
ticular heights in the various fields
of human labor and research, are
as time goes on, given more and
more recognition for the good that
they contribute toward ■ humanity.
Not that they seek such recognition,
for often their work is not recog-
nized until ’ far after their death,
but rather that those who live to
benefit and appreciate what a few
have striven for, feel that ..recogni-
tion should be given for unusual
attainment. It is only right that
it should be so.
In New York -the other day, the
colonnade of the Hall of Fame .was
the scene of impressive ceremonies
at which \time the unveiling of the
busts/ of ten Americans, nine men
and one woman, took place. The
persons whose memory was so hon-'
ored were from greatly diversified
fields of human endeavor. All,
however, had given their bit that
those who were to come, might
live life in a( way that was more
pleasing, more worth while. Such
names in American history as John
Adams, Phillips Brooks, .Samuel
L. Clemens, Peter Cooper, James
Buchanan Eads, Joseph Henry, An-
drew Jackson, Thomas Jefferson,
William Thomas Green Morton, and-
Alice Freeman Palmer should be
known to every loyal American as
being symbolical of the spirit with
which each-true- lover-of'humanity
labors.
They were,, all' honest -and
sincere Americans, bent only on
improving the plight of their fellow
neighbor and of his neighbor. They
can be included among our great
American contributors and .deserve
wholly of all praise and. recognition.

INCURABLE YOUTH
What the world is coming to' is
a very troublesome question to the
elder generation. Youth, does not
seem to be so much concerned al-
though it is the'cause of its elder’s
loss of sleep in thinking of the fate
of the world. Lecturers announce
from the platform that civilization
is doomed; pastors preach it from
.t.ie pulpit; authors write books prov-
ing it; and the older ’ generation
stands ‘ aside with its hands held
high in) holy horror, lamenting the
goings-bn of the younger genera-
tions and dismally wondering how
soon the universal disaster will hap-
pen. .	- - -
And ‘ all the while, the younger
generation, knowing that it can be.
young only’once and then' not for
iong, । ■ mocking' arid shouting' and
laughing at the doleful prophecies,
keeps working^ arid playing, and
striving arid failing arid struggling
on again, always learning the things
of life, and.always doing in.the ul-
timate the things it • should.
Youth is incurable! It listens at-;
tentively to the wise' sayings and
good advice of its elders,.and then
promptly forgets all it heard. ' It
freely .admits that it should burn
inidnight oil and work unceasingly
toward a high goal and prom .
to do so, then stays ■ up 'all night
at a senseless game ofcards or
works untiringly to break a mara-
thon dance.record. '
Youth is willing to learn but of
its own experience., It; is fearless
and daring and questioning, arid in-
sistent: upon? its rights. : Left to
itself, it makes many - mistakes; but
in the end takes only- that which
is good; Youth may be silly, fool-
ish; wasteful,' and even destructive,
but these characteristics ?are mere
externals, inclosing within them all
the soundness and the worth ‘ that
even the harshest, of aged , critics
could demand.—The Daily Cardinal.
Seniors Should Get
Ball Week Programs
Programs for Senior Ball week
are now in the hands of the com-
mittee and may be received from
Frank J. O’Boyle, Sorin Hall. These
programs contain the place and the
hour of every activity, and as they
will prove indispensible, all seniors
attending the Ball are advised to
procure one immediately.
In answer to the many inquiries
as to the number of dances to be
played at the Senior Ball, the com-
mittee has decided on a program
of sixteen dances to be played in
the following order: six dances, two
extras, six dances, two extras. The
orchestra, Don Bestor with Ben-
son’s Collegians of the Terrace
Gardens, Chicago, has been notified
of this, and it is promised that
this program will be rigidly ad-
hered to.
There are about fifty seniors who
have not completed payments on I
their tickets. ' Unless these men
make their payments to any mem-
ber of the ticket committee, to
O’Boyle or Desmond in Sorin or to
Gallagher or Gibbons in Corby, be-
fore Saturday it will be assumed
that they are ’ not attending the
Ball, and places will not be reserved
for them at the dinner dance. A
list of those who have not com-
pleted payments on their Ball tick-
ets will be published in Saturday’s
“Daily” with the purpose in view
of reminding those who have per-
haps forgotten of the balance due
on their tickets, and enabling them
to clear up any difficulties that may
exist.
Those seniors who have' had any
difficulty in arranging for Saint
Mary’s girls in obtaining permis-
sion : to attend Ball activities- are
advised to see Gallagher or. Des-
mond, and the matter will be taken
up with Sister Claudia.

State Schools on
Edge for Classic
CORBY AND DAY ADVANCE
IN HALL LEAGUE RACE-
With the Indiana intercollegiate
state meet scheduled ’ for Cartier
field one week off, the universities
and colleges of the Hoosier country
are making intensive preparations
to enter the annual classic and
make a supreme bid for the title
which has rested so long in the
athletic annals of Notre Dame.
Ten schools, representing a total
entry of about 175 athletes will
throng Notre Dame’s famous foot-
ball lot on May 24, and a cut and
. dried dope sheet is, not in the mak-
ing for the big meet, since the
Indiana schools are harboring sev-
eral “dark horses” that may reg-
ister the unexpected. Also, some
of the so-called stars of. the state
track circles may be on the indis-
posed list. The outstanding cer-
tainty, however, is that Butler will
be the most popular challenger of
the meet.
Notre' Dame will have both rec-
ords and the title. to defend and
while the' staging of the meet on
the home grounds will be to the
advantage of the Irish, Coach
Rockne is depending on the real
abilities of his team to uphold the
honor of the Blue and Gold. The
performances of the Irish during the
indoor and -outdoor season has been
1 of a varying nature. The work of
Rockne’s charges looked particular-
ly good during the winter season
and the sensational win over Wis-
consin augured well, for the calibre
of .the team that would ’ represent
the university in the state meet.
The unequal competition offered by
the outdoor meets thus far has left
1 no, means by which to judge the
real merits of -the Notre Dame
. track team on\the cinders, except
on a time basis.'
Much the same situation is ap-
plicable to the other schools in the
state inasmuch as many of the dual
—meets-have-been. walk-away s.f or _ the
victors. ’	’	.
. tn the field events, Gene Oberst
' stands out as the overwhelming
favorite in the javelin. The giant
Kentuckian already holds the state
title and his marks made in the
Kansas and Penn meets, indicative
of his consistency, will not suffer
in the state meet. Harrington in
the pole vault will have to compete
with the Olympic? aspirant, Jones.’
The latter has been vaulting 12 feet,
6 inches, but the Irish entrant, in

Inability of the Carrol batters to
hit the curves of Tathem and Lay-
den, Corby pitchers, resulted in the
latter’s victory over the dorm nine,
on the Browson diamond Thursday
afternoon, 7 to 4.
With the Corby hurlers pitching
air-tight ball, the Carrollites lost
their only chances to score by poor
base running. Corby took an early
lead with three runs the first inning
and was never in danger. Carroll
registered but one in the second in-
ning and three more in the seventh.
The victory was Corby’s third win
of the season and put it from sixth
into fourth place in the interhall
standing.	'
Maher, of Corby, made a bid for
home run honors when he slugged
a four-base hit during .the game.
Collins and Fox were the other
leading batters for Corby, each
smashing a double.	. ■„

Day performed in the best style
it' has shown since the Interhall
baseball season opened, with the
result that it defeated the Fresh-
man, .team on the’ Brownson field
Thursday afternoon, 9 to 4, in a
seven inning combat.
Nyikos hurled the same brand of
ball that has featured the other off-
campus victories, holding the Frosh
batters to four runs, while his team
mates were pounding the slants of
the Frosh .hurlers for enough runs
to keep Day in the lead. Leading
by one score, the Off-campus ag-
gregation' decided the battle, by
scoring five times in the sixth in-
ning. ’The yearling team attempted
to tie the score in the final frame
but the rally netted but one marker.

,Notre Dame will be represented
by four athletic teams on foreign
fields this afternoon, the baseball
nine meeting St. Viators at'Kanka-
kee, the golf and tennis teams at,
Loyola and Coach Rockne at Lans-
ing with the track team.	;
Coach Keogan and his, baseball
nine will face a trying job this
afternoon when the aggregation at
Kankakee is encountered. Notre
Dame has usually been superior to
St. Viators inasmuch as Notre Dame
has a greater enrollment' to draw,
from. The opposition, however,
will meet the Keoganites almost on‘
even terms on the diamond.
The golf and tennis clubs will
dominate the athletic bill at Loyola
this afternoon, and the outcome
favors Notre Dame, though not by
any great margin. The tennis-squad
will play three singles and7 two
doubles. The following men will
make the,trip: Donovan, Lutz,
Gonzalez, Velasco . and Captain
Centlivre.
The Michigan Aggies will furn-
ish’ the entertainment at Lansing
this afternoon with odds heavily
against them. The following men
made the trip: Layden, Barr,,Ham-:
ling, Walsh, McTiernan, Cox, Bar-
ber, Wagner, Kennedy, O’Hare,

The/ high jump, which, has been a

lei’ and Wabash will each send a
weight man to press the competi-
tion for the Irish tracksters. 7
; Notre Dame’s sprint and middle
distance teams are going to meet
some fast coriipany from several of
the downstate schools. Grey of
Butler is exceptionally fast, and
is probably the leader in the state
sprint class .outside of Barr and
Layden/of Notre Dame and Sprad-
ling of Purdue. Butler, Wabash
and De Pauw will be well repre-
sented in the hurdles. Griggs of
Butler is a particularly fast man
over the barriers,. as is also his
tearrimate, Woods. Cripe of Wa-
bas^ is another timber topper .that
is conceded in the class of Griggs
and Woods;
: Kennedy of Notre Dame will meet,
two powerful rivals in the mile with
Doolittle of Butler and Robbins of
Wabash. The latter won the mile
in the state meet last year with
a mark. of 4:24. ,/ Captain , Kennedy
negotiated 4:21/on.the indoor sand
path against' the Badgers; . Doolittle
has , represented the Butlerites in
the - mile - run all season, and lias
registered., some'' very ■ creditable
time.r'	”	.	' . .
‘A/classy field will come to the
mark in the quarter and half mile
events. McTiernan and Luke Walsh
of Notre Dame will have to circle
the .oval jn .the vicinity, of .49 flat.
Montague, the billiant Notre Dame
quarter miler, last year had : to
break, all speed records to win over
ttie Wabash and Butler runners ori
the Purdue cinders. Cox may not
have a great deal of trouble in
the 880-yard run since Robbins of
Wabash may be given the mile or
two mile to run. .	,
■ That Butler and Wabash will be
out to get the scalp of the Notre
Dame aggregation cannot be de-
bated. The longer Notre Dame has
retained the title, the more intense
have become the ambitions of the
Indiana colleges to wrest the crown
away from the. Blue and Gold. A
moderately warm day with no wind
and a fast track will be a fitting
introduction' to one of the best
track meets that has ever been run
off in Indiaria. /	,
