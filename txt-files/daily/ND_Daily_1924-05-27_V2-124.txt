- April-Scholastic^^- -—
FeaturesEssay
The. April issue of the Scholastic,
’ which appeared on the campus the
; latter part of last week, has for its
: feature a'brilliant essay on the late
Rev. John Talbot , Smith LL. D., by
Rev. John Cavanaugh, C. S. C. It
| is- written in masterly English, deal-
[ing with all the important parts of
1 the , famous Father Smith’s life.
] Father Cavanaugh in closing says
i of ' the great priest, “No greater,
j better, more lovable or admirable
Ipriest has graced.the sanctuary in
jour generation. To those who
knew him intimately, the. recollec-
tion of his sweet and rare nature
will always be "a comfort arid an
: inspiration.” ,
The. Rev. Charles L. O’Donnell’s
poem, “At - Shakespeare’s.' Grave,”
also helped to make the issue .highly
; pleasing.	. j ■
Robert Riordan' wrote a splendid
article on the Laetare Medalist of
1924,. Charles Donaugh Maginnis of
Boston, for the issue. - .
' Joseph A. Brieg, freshman journ-
alist, has his. third published story
of-the school year, in the issue,-
"Giovanni ithe Unlucky.”/ It is well
done and a credit' to the yearling
who seems destined to much greater
things < in the line of writing.
The affirmative arguments ' of
“Shall We Haye a -World Court”
were , all reprinted iri the number
as delivered by Paul Breen, Philip
Moore, C. S. C.,. and Ben Piser.
: There are many other interest-
ing numbers, too. numerous to re-
late here, among them being the
interesting ^editorials which deserve
: special mention. ’ The April Schol-
astic is surely a credit to its editors,
the Scribblers.
SCRIBBLERS BANQUET OFF
The. committee in charge of the
; Scribblers’ < farewell banquet an-
nounced'that the affair which was
•scheduled for Wednesday evening
|had been postponed indefinitely.
| The postponment was caused by a
jconflicting affair. A'special meet-.
|ing of the Scribblers -will be held on
jMonday, June 2, at. 12:30. Electiori
j of .officers and plans for next year
jWill be determined upon.
Few Domes Left
for Distribution
Announcement has been made by
the business staff of the 1924 Dome
that the .supply of available copies
on the campus is being rapidly ex-
hausted. Students who desire a copy
of the Doriie are requested to ar-
range for the purchase or reser-
vation of one immediately. Seniors,
especially, who have not yet ob-,
tained a Dome are asked to call
at the Dome office, rear of . Corby
hall, to arrange for the reservation
of a copy. x It is desired that every
senior be given ample opportunity
to get a Dome.	'	-
The unprecented sale of Domes
this year makes it a practical cer-
tainty that there will be no more
copies available on the campus
■within a short time. /

MONOGRAM BALL
IS HUGE SUCCESS
150 COUPLES ATTEND DANCE;
LEATHER PROGRAMS
ARE FAVORS
The Monogram club formal dance
held last night at the Palais Royale
was one, of the most pleasing and
successful affairs held in recent
years; For color, vivacity, and en-
tertaining the dance came but sec-
ond to the class dances. Harry
Denny’s orchestra played the regu-
lar program of dances, featuring
the song-hit !of the Senior ball,
“Toodle-de-do.”
The patrons and patronesses in-
cluded Mr. and Mrs. K. K. Rockne,
Mr. George Keogan, Mr. and Mrs.
Frank Coughlin, Mrs. Edward Mee-
han, Mr. and .Mrs. James Dooley
and Professor James McCarthy.
Leather1 Programs.
’ Among the pleasing features of
the dance were the programs which
were in rough blue leather with
the Notre Dame monogram centered
tendencies of the club were reflected
On the front cover. The athletic
tendencies of thd club were reflected
in the arrangement of the dance
program -proper. Instead of “pro-
gram” the title was “The Events.”
They ran as follows: the 100-yard
dash, the low hurdle hop, the: dis-
cus fling, the broad jump, the mile
run, the javelin sling,"’the' high’
hurdle caper, the shot put, the pole
vault, the cross country glide, the
midnight relay, the moonlight mara-
thon.	.	-
Rivals Ball.
The gowns displayed at the
formal were such as to rival'some
of those seen at the ball. The ball-
room was decorated in an unusual
way. . AcrosS' the ceiling were
strung myriad of Notre Dame pen-
nants and colors. The effect of this
scheme was remarkable when the
ball-room lights were turned down
to gold and blue. - . .
. Those responsible for the success
of this annual dance include Harvey
Brown,24’ president of the club,
and the dance committee^ consisting
of; Raymond Brady,, ’24, chairman;’
Tom Reardon, ’24;‘Don Miller, ’25,
and^ Harry Stuldreher, ’25. The
other officers of the club follow:
Reverend J. Hugh O’Donnell, ’94,
honorary. president; Hugh” Magev-
ney, ?24, vice-presiderit, arid Paul
Kennedy, ’24, secretary and treas-
urer. '
.• Music Is Good. ’
The significant note of the whole
affair-. was the abundance of. good
music, and good, dancers. It was
with regret that the. last notes of
the Victory March sounded to the
enthusiastic crowd. For the -150
couples - tjiat attended the affair'
called for encore after encore..
The dance was characteristic of
the Monogram club iri that only
thosewho were in the, club, or close-
ly affiliated ’with" it/ attended the
affair. The guests included one per-
sonal .friend of each Monogram
man, the minor letter men, and
those who assisted in the Mono-
gram Absurdities. This same show
will be presented during Commence-
ment, and it is hoped that .the affair
will, be as succesful as it was when
presented in Washington halt a
short time ago.
The-Monogram club has success-
fully put over a . memorable dance.

“Spring Rapture,” the musical

among which were a number of
Notre Dame ' priests and students,
and from start to finish the pro-
gram was exceptionally well re-
ceived.

stone McDermott'-, and Davis Mc-
Keown of Notre Dame aided the

dedicated to1 Rev. W. A. Maloney,
C. S. C., and was produced through

academy.

NOTRE DAME WINS
OVER BADGERS; 9-3
HEAVY HITTING FEATURES
EIGHTH WIN OVER BIG
' TEN TEAMS
Notre Dame added another con- _
ference team to its long string of
Big Ten victories when the Keogan-
ites took the Wisconsin Cardinals
into camp by the score of 9 to 3.
The victory over the Badgers marks
the eighth conference' win.
Heavy Hitting Features.
* Notre Dame’s win over Wisconsin
was featured with plenty of heavy
hitting, triples by Silver of Notre
Dame and Goss of Wisconsin.
Crowley, Vergara and Nolan each
contributed a pair of bingles and
the work of the Irish fielders, reach-
ed the high point of the season’s
hopes. Vergara’s work in the left •
field, which included the scooping
in of flies at times when a loose
ball meant a run, contributed large-
ly to yesterday’s' victory. The tri-
umph was not without its dark side
however, for Jim Pearson, who has
been covering the . third_ sack in •-
brilliant fashion all season, injured .
his ankle sliding into second base.
Although the extent of his injuries
is not known, it is feared .that he
will be out for the rest of the sea-
son. 'Pearson is the third Notre
Dame player to sustain an injury
slidinginto,second, .base,
With Magevney on the mound for
Notre Dame and a fast working in-
field behind him, the Badgers did .
not have much chance to break into
the scoring except in (the fourth
inning when two singles, a triple •
and a wild pitch gave Wisconsin
three runs. It was the Badgers’ ‘
turn to score and ,they were pound-
ing the ball viciously although the
Irish hurler had it breaking over
the plate nicely., Wisconsin garn-
ered eight bingles during the game
but five of them were ineffective ■
since the Badgers were unable to .
hit when men were on the bases.
Open In usual Style.
Notre Dame opened the game in .
the, usual smashing style scoring
four runs on five hits before the
visitors ever came to bat. Sheehan
led off with a clean single and was
followed by Crowley. Vergara’s '
hit scored the Irish leader and
Dunne’s single sent Crowley home
for the second counter. Two errors:
and a single by Nolan brought Dun-
ne home and a strike out, a fly and ‘
an infield out finished ’ the inning.
Four Big Inning.
Wisconsin and Notre Dame both
used the fourth inning to add to
the score board. Wisconsin shoved
in three runs on two singles, a triple
and a wild- pitch. The Badgers .
were displaying a powerful aggres-
siveness but their savage attack was
dampened by two infield. outs and
a strike out., Prendergrast opened •
the fourth with a neat single into
left field arid advanced to second '
whe» Magevney reached the initial
sack on an error. A sacrifice by
Sheehan and a single by Crowley
let Prendergrast and 'Magevney
come home. An .error and. two
singles . counted two more runs
Dunne and Nolan scoring on the
play in which- Pearson was injured ’
Notre Dame counted again in the
seventh, when Silver; smashed"^ long
high one into center field with Nolan

‘ A SCHOOL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.
—It is planned to open, in the fall, a school of international rela-
• tions at John Hopkins University. The school will, be known as
the Walter Hines Page, school, and will .be for -the purpose of invest-
igation and; research in the field of world affairs, and of aiding other
colleges • and, universities already giving instruction, in this subject.
, ” - The resolutions leading to the establishment. of ‘ this .school were
- drafted .as follows: ,	\ ,	' .
• 1. Recognizing in the growing influence .of the United States
in. world affairs, and the inevitable , interdependence of nations, the
/need of a sclipol of .highest standards "and equipment for the’conduct
‘ of research Tail'd' .trainingiii tlitT' field'^f
; ' , cordially endorse in principle the establishment; of a, school of inter-
■ . national relations. —	. ‘	1	'
2. We understand a proposal has been' advanced that such , a
school be connected;with John Hopkins University and also that the
further proposal; has been. advanced that because of this eminent
practical service in promotion; of sound international; relations at a
critical period in our history the name of Walter Hines ■ Pages be
associated with the-school.-, :	:	.	1
3. The Chairman .is, hereby aiithorizpd- to appoint a committee
to confer with,the President‘of John Hopkins.University, with friends
of the late Walter Hines- Page and others fin order to further these
proposals arid bring them, if possible, into fulP realization. '
From this it can be gleaned that the school' is to be more than
a mere school of diplomacy, It will go into the history of .inter-
/ national relations, international’-law, diplomatic practice and procedure
- and international organizations. It is even possible . that a . year of
; study abroad,' in which racial peculiarities and political and social
undercurrents1 can be determined. t , \	,
'	. That this will be a beneficial thing for’ the United States is
apparent. 'Considering the Japanese problem of immigration,1 before1
' the country at this irioment, the increasing commercial intercourse be-
tween the various nations, the problem ,of war'debts, and in numerous
other ways . the benefit of such a course .canriot be estiinated.
SPORTSMANSHIP.:	.
'. Press wires from Paris ^bring news each week of the events of the
1924 Olympics, chronicling, the victories ofAmerican teams in rugby,r
soccer, and other sports, arid iri the lines of the reports there invariably
/is the phrase “the crowd booed and hissed as the American flag was ruri
. up* the pole;”'	‘
> Primarily this a questiori of sportsirianship, under the surface it
may indicate a question,of a more serious nature. It is not our purpose
to discuss it from the international angle, however, but. rather, from1 that
. of sportsmanship, . >	•'	/ ■	-
American athletes have long been, known for Their sportsmanship.
■ It is an outgrowth, it may be.safely said, of college' sports. The high
sense, of loyalty to college, and yet the deep respect, for the ability of
•rivals, is fundamental'iri intercollegiate sports. ; True,-there are some
' violations of; the code, but .on the whole college contests are examples of
. -excellent rivalry. To win if possible, if not, to lose hs gentlemen.
; .It is that spirit, that.keeps the American athletes now in Paris from
letting the petty jealousies of the Europearis iriterfere with their work.
; In. spitp of it all, they are going ahead cooly, winning right along, and
j when the Olympics are over, the world will have to acclaim them cham-
. pions;—like'it or not. .	, :	< .. .....

What Others Say
The college student, especially the
undergraduate, should prepare him-
self in college for that which he
will need out of college—to adjust
himself to the world. No swimmer
would attempt to plunge into ice-
cold water out of a hot shower.
The -wise student will begin early
to prepare hiriieslf for the shock
that comes with his • entrance into
the struggle for economic existence.
Students have no reason to fear
the future, the “big man” of the
campus least of all; he is well pre-
pared. For in reality, activity, on
the campus is little different from
activity in actual business ox* pror
fessional life.—Daily Northwestern.
A UNIVERSAL FRATERNITY
There is a fraternity that has no
geographical boundaries, which en-
joys universal prestige; that pos-
sesses no caballistic signs, which has
no secrets. It holds aloft ideals,
however, and is unfaltering in its
creed. The-fraternity is that com-
posed of gentlemen; the creed—sin-
cere belief in the riltimate good of
mankind, his nobility and worth, be
he born with the.gold or the pewter
spoon.
By no‘outward badge or insignia
are we to recognize him as member
of the fraternity. Yet we know him.
Around him is 'met; felt, and absorb-
eri an indefinable essence which
warms and is inspiring.. There -is
something ' in his grip when he
shakes hands that carries a message.
There is no hidden message or touch
to indicate who he is, just a firm,
warm clasp. Dignity of bearing,
mental and physical elasticity, effer7
vescence in spirit, belief in the good-
DO ACTIVITIES PAY?
“A big man on the, campris but
he’ll, not amount to much when he
gets out into, the world.”
So says the cynic who is' con-
vinced that universities ; only ed-
ucate fools. And down deep in hisi
heart, 'the big’ man on the campus
himself shivers a. bit as he foresees
the “cold, cruel world” awaiting
him beyond, the commencement
platform—-a little, carefully-rcon-
ce'aled fear that campus popularity
will fade into nothingness in the
bffftle-^f-realHife.^^^-™-^^^
. True enough, the glamour,sur-
rounding a political campus job or

Irish Play Return
Game with Michigan
The last lap of Notre Dame’s 1924
baseball schedule will begin next
Thursday afternoon when the Keo-
ganites meet the . University . of
Michigan nine on the Wolverine
diamond. ‘
Since the last meeting of the two
> rivals, Notre Dame has been fast
mounting the latter of conference
victories barring the orie game lost
to Iowa. Michigan has displayed a
better .brand' of baseball since they
appeared here, April.30, and num-
bered among their victims are Illi-
' nois, Iowa, and Northwestern. In-
juries help to upset the smooth
working infield while the Wolverine
nine was playing through its con-
ference schedule but Coach Fisher’s
twirling staff has been .very effec-
tive in sustaining the calibre, of the
team.
The Michigan Aggies’ squad ap-
peared to provide more competition
than? did any pther conference
/ nines. Michigan won over the Ag-
gies, 1 to 0, in ;the first encounter
; and 3 'to .l in the second meeting
: Fisher’s crew of, sluggers still re-
tained the hitting power they dis-
played when the Maize ■ and Blue
came to Notre Dame. Blott, Hag-
gerty, Dillman and Steger have
placed high in the conference batt-
' ing average list and in the list of
/ extra base hits, with two and three
baggers.	■	’	■
' Coach Keogan can still deperid on
■ his sextet of sluggers to ring up
the counters when a hit means a
, run. Vergara, Crowley, Farrell
and Dunne in the outer garden pack
a :powerfuli drive at bat and are
errorless in the field. Sheehan, No-
lan and Silver,'from the infield con-
stitute a,dependable trio that have
, accounted for runs in every game
’ played. ' . ,	x

. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY—Dr.
Nicholas Murray Butler, president
of the university recently issued the
following statemerit commending
the interest being, ardused among
college students - by the formation
of political clubs in universities
throughout the country^
.‘Many of the young men of the
country are growing up under con-
ditions which confuse them as to
the meaning of political issues.. A
cure for this condition will be found
-in-arousing political interest-apd~in-
bringing accurate political informa-
tion sto the thousands of intelligent
and high spirited youths' who are
to be found in our colleges and uni-
versities.” ,	. <

Gene Oberst Enters
Trials at Ann Arbor
Gene Oberst, Notre Dame’s prem-
ier javelin thrower, holder of the
Indiana state record, Penn relay’s
field record, Kansas university field
record and the Notre Dame field
record, will enter the sectional
Olympic tryouts at Ann Arbor next
Saturday, it was announced by
Coach Knute K. Rockne yesterday.
Although Oberst is the only one
entered from Notre Tame there is
a possibility that some of the other
notable performers on the Notre
Dame track team will be entered.
The mark set by Oberst in the
Indiana state meet held on Cartier
field last Saturday came within five
inches of the American intercolle-
giate record held by Milton Angiers
of Illinois. Oberst will probably
compete, in the sectional tryouts
this week with Hoffman, star javelin
thrower of the Michigan track team
last year who is-still a student at
the Wolverine school. The Michigan
man hovered around the 200 foot
mark during his last year of compe-
tition and is reported to have been
in training all spring for the Olym-
pic trials.
Tom Lieb’s official discus mark'of
158 feet, 10 inches made in'an
exhibition trial at the state meet
last 'Saturday afternoon practically
assures the Irish weight star of a
place on the American ' Olympic
team. Lieb will enter the trials at
Boston next month in. competition
with . such men as Mucks, former
Wisconsin star; Pope, I. A. G., and
Hartranft of Stanford university.
Lieb now holds the national mark at
151 feet, 4 inches.

track and . field meet at Ann Arbor,
to try out for the honor of repre-

in the final contest at Cambridge,
Mass., June 13 and 14.
Notre Dame will be ably repre-
sented in this meet by Tom Lieb,
discus thrower, and Eugene Oberst,

er records count for anything,
should have no trouble in wining
places in the Olympic tryouts.

FEMINIZATION AND - THE
HUMANITIES	'
' After all the discussion there has :
been- of co-education, its merits and :
its faults," it might seem to be ex-
tremely difficult to say something
new on the subject. Nevertheless, 1
Prof. Rollo Walter Brown, an edu- <
cator of considerable note, in a
recent article, does bring’forth a
point that at least seems.to be new.
Professor Brown is opposed to ,
the mingling, of the sexes in. col-
\ leges, and yet he dismisses as either
- trivial or . absurd practically _ all of :
the- -stock arguments against it. He
ridicules: the idea that young men
and women have any more or differ-
ent opportunities for association in
the, coeducational institutions^than
they do in 'those where the sexes,
are segregated, or ;than they do at ।
■' home. He does not share, or at
any , rate :he does not mention, the
' argument of such a noted authority ;
as Dr. Muensterberg. that, girls when :
in 'classroom with boys necessitate
a feriiinization of the instruction ,
given.	.	. .
- ■ Professpr Brown’s grievance is
different' from all these and per- ,
haps puts a new bee in the bonnet
of anti co-educational cranks. He (
insists that when'girls and boys go
to college together ..the result is that
there is a separation/of the studies
- pursued into- two classes, those that
are manly and those that are wo-
manly, and/that among the latter (
- there tends to be placed what used
to be called the “humanities,” in-
cluding the ancient and modern
languages and their literatures.
xIf this charge is well founded,
and its author has collected from
many college catalogues a' host of
statistics that seem to prove or at
least to support his contention, the
. most serious part of it as the con-
clusion as to the development of
the' inhumane among the men going
to co-educational institutions. • At
a time when it is especially desir-
able that men should be “humane,”
those who attend co-educational col-
. leges - are ' made “inhumane,”, it
- wohld’seem, for lack' of the gentler
influences' of the studies they scorn-
as ^“sisterly.”
1 ..It cannot be denied that the hu-
' ■ manities are sadly neglected in the
modern college. Xenophon, Herods
otus, Homer, the Bucolic poets,
Plato, Euripides, Aritotle, Greek
drama. Virgil, Horace, Juvenal;
Lucretius, Pliny, Tacitus, and Livy.
' are but meaninglessnames -to a
great majority. . Milton,. Chaucer,
early English drama, or Spencer are:
- too frequent strangers, to college
gaduates. The higher courses in
modern languages are often shunn-
ed; Goethe, and Schiller, Moliere
and Hugo in the original delight
but a select few.
Neglect of .the “humanities” is
widespread, it is true. But the
charge that this neglect comes as a
result of co-education seems far-
fetched' and illogical. Rather in
these statistics an observer can
vaguely glimpse a general tendency
of the times—a tendency against
all except directly useful' studies,
those that help in the making of
a living. And it is to the working
out of the elective system on a
too practical basis, rather than to
“feminization” that the modern ig-
norance and neglect of the “hu-
manities” is chiefly due.—Michigan
