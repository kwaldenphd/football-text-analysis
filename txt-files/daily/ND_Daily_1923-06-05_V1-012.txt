a good job Well done
Newspapermen seldom distribute bouquets- among themselves, but
they always -recognize achievement;, : They' could not. avoid classifying
the 1923 Donie as a distinct. accomplishment in collegiate. publication
' and granting to its sponsors the high credit that their work merits.
Because he is as.modest as talented.and because he is editor-in-
. chief of the Daily—as, well as the Dome, Harry W. Flannery refused
his “imprimatur” for an editorial eulogy of the annual. But to let its
appearance pass without commendation of its editorial and . artistic
originality and the thoroughness with.which all.interests of the univer-
sity are covered would be unworthy of Notre Dame’s traditional alacrity
- in acknowledging a job well done. /Tor the book is nothing less than an
original production, perfectly executed.	. . ..
The sketches presenting members of the senior class, their collegi-
ate joys, sorrows and activities are altogether. new, .and though 'the.
verse be free, enough to satisfy Amy/Lowell,it willTn \years to come be
—y7 poetry to the man^of	?\Tlie' five' sections/cover ’every" interest 6n~the'
. campus. The art work is so unusual that it called forth widespread
comment for the masterly way in which the Gold and..Blue introduces
■ ,. the volume, its makers and its subject; The photographic work and*its
/reproduction is especially good..
- No less credit is due Thomas . J. Walsh, business manager, and
. members of his staff, who made the issue /financially, possible. ' Their
industry is reflected in the'55 pages of high class advertising and the
. excellently printed and handsomely bound volume;—G. L.

The Techno-Log
The civil, engineering course is
very probably the oldest of all en-
gineering courses now ^offered to
the, young men pursuing'.technical
studies at Notre Dame.
Though no written record is avail-
able,, the name of Professor Arthur
Joseph Stace is handed, down to us
by; tradition as the founder of the
course. He was born. Jan. 28, 1838,
at.Berwick, County Essex, England,
The- days , of his .. childhood were
spent on his father’s farm, under
7 . the careful direction., and instruc-
;—	'tiorrofTiisnn.other: Itrwas^from'heb:
that he received his elementary edu-
cation. In the. month of June, 1852,
he came to Canada/ and spent the
following six years there. During
and for many years kept the mem-
bers laughing-by his humorous, writ-
ings. He was a literary and class-
ical scholar, astronomer, astrologer,
examiner in Greek, and “a poet
Tom Hood might have Toyed.” He
was the. author .of “Astronomical
Predictions,” a series of humorous
writings. The “Predictions” prov-
ed, however, a source of much un-
easiness to nearby farmers, who
misunderstood and accepted them
as an almanac. He even wrote, some
verse in a medium similar to what
Walt. Mason'popularized as “rimed
prose,” In character Professor
Stace was very much similar to
Lewis- Carroll and Edward Lear—
mathematicians famous; in ’ English,
-literature.	’
FORGETTING COURTESY
. Ten months to four years at Notre Dame have taught us the value
of the friendship that arises from fellowship, and’we are sometimes
. inclined to think this link is . enough. Yet it. is probably ’the lesser of
two of the marks that should distinguish a. collegian. The'other mark
is, courtesy, based not necessarily so much on the day’s conventionali-
ties, as upon sincere thoughtfulness of others/ ..	' • ..
On the campus we grow careless,, possibly because we measure and
are measured, and therefore know how to take, one another., An inci-
'dent brought this to mind the. other day. ’ Four women were in the
midst of a service in the University chapel being - participated .in : by
most of the student body, but were unable to'take an actiye' part.'.because
they lacked hymn cards. An aged-man went out of his way to provide
them. Smiles spread across the faces of a number of students, wlio
v were near him a'nd better able to perform the service. - ,; -
. . / This act-and its consequence seemed/to us to illustrate one of the
dangers of community life of young; men. . This danger is a tendency
. to overlook the finer relations of life, which after allare the cream on
..the milk-of human;kindness.- •	-	’ \
THE QUESTION AGAIN
.Well over'600 students live in;the city. Of this number 150 are
residents of South Bend. • Out of these . 600 students/ less than -200
subscribed;to. the DAILY;, arid of the'200, sorhe 40 or more are tcsL
dent students in the city. , What is: the matter with thq remaining 400?.
Of the 200 subscribers in South Bend,; few are. juniors or seniors;
showing, almost.,beyond a doubt- that these, men who have lived- in
South Bend for three dr four years . have drifted intd an attitude' of
indifference towards the school and its activities.' One of the prime
motives in founding the DAILY was the belief and. hope that it would
. serve to bring the Day Students into closer touch with their .school
and, the campus activities. Whole-hearted cooperation "from the Day
Students was looked forward'to with.little apprehension. ■ The response
of, the Day Students, both to appeals'for subscriptions and subsequent
appeals for payment of these:, subscriptions shows’. that these hopes
were not in keeping with the attitude of Day Students toward the
DAILY.	/	,
. A rough estimate based on .figures shows that'the percentage of.
support given the,DAILY by the Day Students is about 30 per cent,
whereas the percentage on the campus/based on similar figures is
closer to 90 per cent. Figuring on those students who reside in town;
for the school-year .only, and at whom this editorial is particularly
directed, the percentage of support runs even much lower.

istry, ’22, will receive the Master

was an instructor in chemistry at.
the University during the first se-
mester of this school year.
' ‘ Among the theses submitted this
. .year are'some very thorough treat-
. ' ises on present day problems. Some
i of the subjects are: “Retail Lum-
ber Advertising,” “The Decline of

. tioh of the Allied War Debt,” “Di-
rect Mail Advertising,” “Resolved:
■ That the National . Bonus Should

, --stead. -The subj ect- for_the _ briefs
this year is the case of John W.
Eakins versus Otto J. Shaw , and
\yife, Mina Shaw. • This is a’case.of.
quiet title to real estate, and it is a
hard case, having been through both
the higher. and lower courts. The
,nature- of it. is confusing and in-
volved because ofx a conflicting
title. - The writer of the. best brief
will receive-a prize of $50; another
. prize of- $50. will be given to the
best public speaker in the College

lege,-says that there should be some
’good-briefs presented even though
the case is a difficult one.

Folgia's Drives Weak Rom-
weber Wins Flight
C Title
Jack Adams defeated Joe Foglia.
for the championship of the Uni-
versity Saturday, ten up and, eight
to play. Adams was consistently
the better man, though Foglia was
off in his driving and consequently
fell back much in his game.
Foglia won the toss .but awarded
the honors to Adams, who sent a
beautiful long drive down the fair-
way. Adams wonx the first hole,
Foglia being unable to siiik a short
putt. Foglia topped his first shot.
Adams parred the second and in-
creased his lead to two holes. The
third hole. was, halved. On the
fourth Foglia drove within several
feet of the pin and took the hole
with a par, three.
Unable to Drive
Unable to drive, Foglia lost three
more holes, .making the score four
up for Adams at the end of the
ninth hole. 'Adams easily captured
the seventh with a birdie three, and
duplicated the feat on the ninth
after a drive of 300 yards..
At the beginning of the second
nine, Foglia uncovered better, golf
and halved three first holes, but
Adams recovered and won the ,13th,
15th and 16th, making pretty ap-
proaches and .putts. At the 18th
tee, Adams, drove but 10 yards short
of the green, and Foglia sliced onto
the first fairway. .On the approach
Foglia sent a high mashie shot to
the green, .but it rolled into the
trap. By a pretty niblic shot he
sank the ball for a birdie three,
as the gallery applauded. Adams
took'a four and at the end of the
18th hole the match stood six up
for Adams. .	'
■ Adams Holds Lead
On the remaining holes of the
match Adams was easily the better,
getting a-.nine hole margin, at the
end of the 27th. On the 28th,.
Adams reached the. 300 yard, mark
and Foglia sent a long shot to with-
in a .few feet of the bunker. Adams
duplicated his opponent’s shot for
distance and direction and lay with-
in five feet- of the green. Foglia
fell short of the hole by eight feet.
Adams - cinched the championship
by a peatiful approach and although
making two put,ts, won the hole,
five and six.	1

Hurler
The final game of the Notre Dame
baseball season will be played next
Saturday when the Illinois team ap-
pears on Cartier .field. ’.. This will :
be the first time that Illinois has
played at Notre Dame in six years.
The game, together with an invita7
tion track meet, will.be the athletic
feature of Senior week.
The Illinois team has traveled at
a fast clip and has defeated Notre
. Dame twice this year. In the first
game the Irish batted O’Connor
from the box, but Jackson held
them scoreless for the -rest of the
game while Illinois piled up ten
runs. Ifi the second'meeting O’Con-
nor pitched a no. hit game against
the Irish and won, 4-0.	.
■ Castner will probably pitch
against Coach Lundgren’s men next
Saturday. It will be his last: game
at Notre : Dame and as captain of
- . the team. Sheehan will probably be
able, to play by Saturday and the
Irish, infield will be considerably
• strengthened. It will be interestr
■ ing to see whether the Irish can
