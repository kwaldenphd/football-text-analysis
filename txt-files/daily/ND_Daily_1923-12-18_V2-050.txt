Thoughts — “things” we usually
say_—Will come to mind. Some
knock for admittance timidly, as
though fearfuL of a rebuff. Others
simply rush in, like book agents or
^collectors, and refuse to be de-
pied a hearing. Anyhow, why deny
them? A live mind finds interest
inmost things,-and is able to create
an interest in all the rest. And
interest is the gateway to learning.
Wisdom waits on it. Joy comes of
it. Get interested.
seen first. The lower side usually
sparkles best when brought to the
light. Like Roman houses, all their
beauty is on the inside, but, unlike
them, the entrance to the interior
is not visible to all who pass them
by. It must be sought for. The
heart of a thought is never pinned
to its sleeve.
Usually minds select things. But
occasionally the process is reversed
and things select minds. And ap-
parently they have preferences.
Sometimes they seem to show fa-
voritism. Some minds have more
company than others, and company
of a better class. Other minds
seem to be lonely and alone.
(“Empty” would be not quite ac-
curate, for eyen a mind can be full
of emptiness.) It may be because
the former, like their owners, are
better entertainers,—more genial,
sociable, sweet-tempered; and the
latter like,—well, a spare bed or a
morgue. But we shall not attempt
to say. Enough to note the fact.
It is interesting; and it has its les-
spn.	.	.
One can turn over a stone, . or a
board embedded in the mud. It re-
quires little - effort, but it may re-
veal unexpected treasures. Dia-
monds are found in mud,—of the
blue clay variety. Pearls are found
in oysters. -One may find only a
worm. But even a worm has its
value; it also has a message for him
who is able to read it.
You may- be proud of the
thoughts that visit you. They may
do you honor.^ If so, very likely,
the rest of us, did we but know, it,
would flock to your fireside, if you
have one, and seek an introduction
to your guests. Of course if you
have merely a local radiator and
limited apartments, you might pre-
fer to. give the introduction in writ-
ing. It would be next best. Only
don’t be selfish. If you are, you will
soon become a bore to your visitors,
and they , will seek other haunts.
We are making a venture. May-
be you will like it, , maybe you
won’t. . In either case, we shall nei-
ther be surprised nor disappointed.
We won’t be surprised if you do,
because we start out by giving you
credit for delighting in ideas. We
won’t be surprised if you don’t, for
it wouldn’t be strange if you did
not enjoy our particular brand.
Others have found fault with them.
We are used to it. In fact, we feel
it stimulating. We certainly won’t
be disappointed at all,’ for we have
everything to gain and •nothing to
lose.	:

at the Blackstone hotel in Chicago,
January 2, 1924.
. Owing to the number of students
who are planning to attend the
dance on their way back to school,
and to the number of tickets that
must be sent to Chicago to take
care of the alumni there, the num-
ber of tickets on the campus is
very limited. It is urged that those
men who desire tickets, see any of
the men who make up the follow-
ing committees: .
Music—J. Ryan, chairman; Ray
Bartzen, John Bower, John Bulger,
and Harold Cooke.
. Floor—W. Metzger, chairman;
George Reuss, Art Koelle, and Ait
Bidwell.
Tickets—-M. Gibbons, chairman;
Frank Cullen, Frances McCurrie,
George Daily, and Bob Carey.
Favors—E. Schwartz^ -chairman;
Rex O’Malley, Bill Rigney, Ed.
Kaveny, and Tom Nash.
• Reception—W. Ryan, "chairman;
Joe Adler, Ed Byrnes, Bob Curry,
and John Moran.	.
There will be a meeting of all
Christmas dance committees at 6:30
tonight in the library. .	..

Arrangements committee, and of-
ficial notification will .be given the
local paper in the home-town of

regarding his appointment.
The ball questionnaire has been
compiled and distributed to the
seniors. The returns have been sat-
isfactory thus far. It is very im-
portant that these be filled out and
returned, so that a proper estimate
can be placed on the number who
afro eligible and will attend the
ball.

At Christmas time I’m up a tree
in more ways than a man should be.
I trim the thing.-with great delight
. and put on every toy and light, and
never once did I yet drop, the star
which goes away, up top. This
part I do'not mind a;bit; I like the
fun of trimming it. It’s not this
way I’m up a tree—it’s buying
things from . “he” and ‘ “thee.”
There’s Joe and. Bill and Pat,—and
well, each one has something great
to sell. There’s Pink who sells a
cartoon sketch—“finance the Prom,
you wealthy wretch.” Doc shows a
view of the greatest team and this
needs bust my budget scheme;
without my door Owen stops, to
cover my chairs with pillow tops.
A calendar hangs upon, the wall;
Gene says it beautiful—but that
ain’t all. < A book of verse all red
and black contributes to the gen-
eral sack; the SCRIBBLERS say its.
worth a dollar, and I like, the cover
too much to-holler. And. as I pack
my clothes and things,-and hock my
watch and pins and rings, I rave
and storm about such buying ’ and
wonder how I’ll keep from dying.
But as I ride the homeward freight,
it somehow seems to. me just great
to sit upon my pillow top and read
the verse the SCRIBBLERS pop,
and then smile and chuckle and
chortle with glee—It there a Santa
Claus? Sure, it’s me.

THE JUGGLER’S CHRISTMAS JEER
.- "The Juggler' believes, that	.he: has too long .condoned
- ;/ th'e day-to-day mouthings of his contemporary’s official clown . . .
\ - -. The Juggler Bas spoken. The Juggler, sole administrator of Notre
= Dame wit—The Juggler, arbiter of all our disputes, judge of all-our
actions, vilifier of those who prefer truth to cleverness—The Juggler,
. which sets such a high standard for its columns that back in 1921 it was
' quoted in Judge—this same Juggler has pronounced the final decision
upon the DAILY and upon one of its columns.
■ This column does not need the approval of Notre Dame’s sophisti-
: cates. It is unfortunate for the sophisticates that, having got their
. mouths into the pie of Notre Dame humor, they feed on the crust alone.
.Such feeding, intellectuals, is more apt to widen your cute, ears than
! bulge your bright foreheads. Nor should you become green with envy
■ if someone finds a raisin in the pie of humor and fails to offer the
; morsel to your crusty lips. ' /	>	;	' ?
- v -’It happens-that the /DAILY is beginning a.new column_in^today’s-
' issue? "By-Paths” has been running two columns; until the new1 col-
■ umn got under way. “By-Paths” .will now resume: its former space of
one column,' conceding its place upon the editorial page to-the new-
• comer. Let the intellectuals of The Juggler sneer, knowingly—sneering
i is about the best thing they do. And it is common knowledge that’ a
. lunatic is allowed to believe himself Napoleon as long as he stays in
: his padded cell.	' . :	.	i
“ • Criminals on trial have been known to accuse someone else of their
own crimes. Poor Juggler! , Its once-bright reputation having grown
' , shadier and shadier, it resorts to a blah-blah attack which it hopes will
shield its own defects.	(	'
True, “By-Paths ’ cannot be the result of long thought and careful
“election. But while it is faulty in some respects, its faults loom like
; iiionstrous virtues when compared with The Juggler. At least Mr.
• Grundy is not-sacrificing the confidence and good-will of the student
body in order to fill his pockets with gold. He would rather be conifi-
idential than commercial, peppy rather than penurious. At least Mr.
; Grundy is not exploiting Notre Dame’s humor as a commercial proposi-
. tion. ’ At least Mr.; Grundy does not. shield his favors from all but the
1 clique of a certain city. And last, but not least, Mr. Grundy rose to be
Mr. Grundy because he worked himself up as, an edit or. Mr. Grundy is
; not an advertising man who became; editor-in-chief of his column because
.	; he was the most successful miser on an avaricious business staff. Mr.
' . Grundy knows the difference between an'adverb and a pronoun; and,
i editor-in-chief of his column, he does not squeeze the title and the gold
: i to his breast and then hire a managing editor to be the true editor-in-
. chief.	-	'	, . . .	•
We apologize to our readers. This space was reserved for a few
- words of good cheer, but instead the jolly Christmas spirit of The
. ; Juggler, prodded from our lips, some hard truth. .	' '	'	. ;
FATHER JOSEPH GALLAGHER, C. S. C. \
■	■ The modest—-almost secret—tribute paid -by his Community to
j Father Joseph Gallagher, C.S.C., yesterday suggested much to the dis-:
“erning observer. It marked the close of. twenty-five years , of earnest,
’ ■effective, kindly work in the priesthood—as rector of old St. Joseph’s
i Hall, as a teacher at Notre Dame, as a trainer of‘priests, resident of
’ Columbia, Oregon, as a Sisters’ ’ chaplain and, now, as Superior of the
Community House, Notre-Dame. Varied enough was the labor and
..always singularly blest with success.'. But what was most observed in
the Jubilee festivities was the universal love he lias inspired among his
' .life-long associates. As a Superior of the Seminary in the "old days’’
. he had much to do with .the for mation-of the men who are now con-
ducting the destinies of the University. Much of their most valuable
training they received from him. That in itself would be a great life-
work—to be the maker of the makers of Notre Dame.	’
‘ “The man whq.advertises that he is a Notre Dame man, by wearing
: monograms on his sheepskin/’ says the S. A. C. chairman,, "is not a
Notre. Dame man.”	"	> .• • -	:	.

CAMPUS
BY-PATHS
I got three letters .yesterday. ?I
was so surprised that I. almost
marked them “Not .at this address.”
One was an invitation saying “DiL
ly,-Dilly, come out and be killed”;
one was from Andy Sleigh request-
ing me. to .inform a curious world
that,he will say it with dynamite.
■: ' •	’	-,O- - -O- .’ ■; ■ - ’ -
The third-was from my grandfa-
ther, Noah- Grundy, who lives: at
Pine Centre, Missouri. He says, ’
“My dear Grandson,
.You-have, been remiss in your
duty, Ebenezer. .You have told the
boys how.many more days there are
until the holidays, but’you haven’t
wished them a merry'Christmas. I
am ashamed to . think. that Hosea

Christmas—a .merry ..Christmas to
all those whose names.have appear-
ed in the column, to all-those whose
names have .not/appeared, to all
those whose names are going to ap-
pear, and 'to all-those who /were

It is funny how little, there is to
write; today/ Everyone is on good

because Santa Claus is coming next

Funny how ambitious that Dome
staff gets.sometimes. Saturday, the
spick and span condition of their
office did them credit. Red Kane
proved to be an expert with the
broom; Pete, the best lineman’ at
Notre Dame, lent a helping hand;
John Bartley’s efforts were noble,
and the editor-in-chief was so busy
that he. reminded the scout of . a
juggler with thirteen plates in the
air at one time. :	'	? .
-o- -o- c	•
When the feverish activity was
over, Bartley retired to his room to
recuperate, bu£ returned in time to
be asked if he kept'horses in Corby.
.	-o- -o-	.
At College Inn Saturday night
the scout called the roll and the
following responded: Tom Walsh,
two DeGurses, Bill Furey, Harold
O’Brien, Charlie Butterworth, and
Jack Adams. ..

Jim Hayes, smooth and pleasant
of manner, urbane and suave, was
there.	'
Eyes”? It is-a/foolish sentiment,
but he sings it’Well.

of the .year Monday night in the
Khights of Columbus council cham-

ute to the .varsity from the men. of
Walsh. '.	- '	•	•
'• Bob Curry, chairman of the'en-
' tertainment committee of the hall,
-presided, and - after a brief intro-
^duction, Father Haggerty, rector'of

It- was a fine tribute to a fine book.
Certainly they appreciated it. Their
efforts have not- gon&.unrewarded—
they have been spurred to greater

test, five of them /being monogram

ening to work on .-something for so
long and then find such an unre-
sponsive student body.

NOTRE DAME DAILY
Tuesday, December 18, 1923,
Rockne Is Interviewed by Daily Man;
■ He Advances Some Real Dope on Season
“All-American teams are nothing
■but guess-work and the tendency in
picking them seems to be to single
put the most spectacular of all of
the. season’s players and give them
the envied positions on the picked
teams.”
That is Knute Rockne’s .opinion
on the all-something or other teams
that are being picked at .this time
of the year. “Notre Dame had many
players that would be just as com-
petent as those picked to carry the
honor of the title of All-American,”
asserts the coach. “But to pick
one of-the Irish players and single
him out as better than the rest
would be impossible, due to the fact
that every man on the team plays
only as well as the rest of the men.”
Mallpry, in his opinion, was the
outstanding player of the East for
* the past season, due to the fact
that he did most of the tackling and
provided all _of the interference
for the Yale team. The West had
no outstanding player this year.. He
continued: “Grange was picked for
his ability to carry the ball and
that was all. He was nothing but a
ball carrier and his work on the de-
fense was nothing extra. All-Amer-
ican teams are not representative,
due to the fact, that the ..men who
are picked would not, in all probab-
ability, be able to play the game
that they are capable of if were not
for their teammates with whom
they had been trained. A team that
material way this year except for
has been playing together all sea-
son could no doubt beat a team
of picked men. Team work is the
greatest essential. in playing foot-
ball as it is played today.
“Football has not changed in any
the fact that more teams have come
around to the Notre Dame style of
play. By that I mean that the play
has been more open and the for-
ward pass has been used to greater
advantage than ever before.
“Our chances for next year are
fairly good and we should have as
good a team for 1924 as we had
this season. We are losing some
good men, but with the material
that we have back and the group of
promising freshmen that were de-,
veloped on the first year squad,'
our team will be in all ways rep-
resentative of the teams that Notre
Dame has turned out in the past.
We have lost fewer men this year
than in the years past and the very
fact that we have experienced men
back insures us a good team.”
Rockne’s optimistic attitude in
regard to next year’s team will make
the student body look forward to
the 1924 season with keen anticipa-
tion, for whatever “Rock” says is
good enonugh to rely upon as fact.

We have in our midst today two
famous alumni of Notre Dame,
Frank “Rat” Thomas and Roger
“Rodge” Kiley, who have returned
to the University for a short ■visit
before returning to their schools to
take up basketball.
’ Frank Thomas is the assistant
coach at the University of Georgia,
where he had a' very successful
season, his team winning five games,
. losing two and tieing one. The
griddders at Loyola College in Chi-
cago realize..the fact that they have
~ a coach extraordinary in “Rodge”
Kiley.- He was given a gold watch
by his men at the end of-'this sea-
son. Kiley, who. is under a.three-
year contract, will return -to Chi-
. cago in a few days., Loyola has
great prospects for next year, as
all of the . first team men of this
year will report for spring practice;
Kiley’s team won seven games and
lost two last fall... On. Thanksgiving
Day. it defeated St. Ambrose, a
team coached by “Fod” Cotton, a
.former star tackle at Notre Dame,
by the score of 6 to 0.	' ■:
Rockne Issues Call
for Track Candidates
• Coach Rockne issues an urgent
call. for track candidates . for the
coming season. During the past
year Notre Danie has lost many of
her valuable track men, and it will
be necessary for every man who has
track ability to answer this call, if
.Notre Dame is to keep track on
the same level with its other major
sports.

Great Bell’s History
As another season of cheer
draws near, to the accompaniment
of ringing bells, it is fitting that we
spend a few moments in a review
of the history of our own—the
Notre'Dame bell.
And may we introduce our sub-
ject with the following paragraph,
taken from an early issue of “The
Scholastic Year”: “This fine bell
with his rich volume of sound has
a national reputation, being the
Diligent and strenuous training
is essential, and /for this reason,
only those men who are willing to
work arduously and: regularly need
become candidates.
Rockne urges that all of the pres-
ent track men keep in training as
much as possible during the holi-
days, so that they will be in condi-
tion to start heavy work as soon as
they return.

ceeds of the sales are to go toward

largest in the United States and
one of the largest in the world.”
In 1866 the bell which now hangs
in Sacred Heart Church was cast
in Le Mons, France, by the famous
Mons. Bollee. For that day and
age’ it was an extraordinary piece
of work, weighing over eight tons,
7 feet in height and 22 feet in cir-
cumference. It . excited interest
and comment in all Europe.
When it arrived in the United
states, the bell and Notre Dame
were given national publicity. In
fact, it was through the bell that
Notre Dame first gained country,
wide prominence.
For eight years after the bell’s
arrival at Notre Dame it hung in a
temporary tower swinging on great
oak timbers. At that time it formed
a topic of general interest to the
community. Its size, its tone and
its cost, $7,889, were topics dis-
cussed as eagerly by each student '
as the football record is today.
In 1875 the bell was moved to
the place it now occupies. Since
that time the bell has. been clearly
heard 27 miles to the west and 24
miles to the east. -

With the last touches given the
1923 football season by the appear-
ance of the mythical honor .team,
consideration reverts, from the ex-
ploits of the varsity teams to the
brilliant work performed in the In-
terhall football ranks during the
season just closed.
The past season has been ac-
claimed the most successful season
ever recorded in hall athletics..
Perhaps, the outstanding feature
that made Interhall so successful
■was the supervision under which the
games were conducted. To Martin
“Bruff” Cleary goes the credit for
the success enjoyed 'by the Inter-
hall league this fall.
Through the work of Cleary, the
games were all supervised and ref-
ereed strictly, in accordance with
rules, and the results obtained
from his work were the better for
his having directed them.
In accordance with past cus-
toms of. choosing a representative
All-Interhall team at the close of
the season as a reward for the men
who have participated with credit
in the games in the league, the
DAILY this year-. publishes the se-
lection of an All-Hall team. The
Captain-Elect Is Interviewed; Would
Rather Work Math Than Talk Football
When Adam Walsh was elected
1924 football captain, he became
more modest and unassuming 'than
ever. • He simply gave his team-
mates what he had to say to Notre
Dame, that he would do his best
to guide its team through an un-
defeated season. And .that, from
Adam Walsh, bespeaks volumes.
Adam .preferred not to talk - of
the schedule next year, some calcu-
lus' problems demanded- attention.
For Walsh is a .mechanical engin-
eer of the class.of 1925, and reti-
cient about expressing an-opinion.
He was one of the greatest ath-
letes that ever left Hollywood
(California) high school, winning
monograms in football, basketball,
and baseball. Coming to Notre
Dame, he. first won recognition in
his freshman year in football. Last
spring he won his monogram in
track, for the hurdles.	\
If is heedless^td comment upon
the gridiron aggressiveness, the
consistent playing, and the “foot-
ball sense” of Adam Walsh. These
were the qualities fittingly recog-
nized in his selection .as football
leader. Being “up and.' at ’em”
every minute he-is in;, the game
makes for the sort of . stuff ex-
pected in a Notre Dame captain. _
The . likeable personality of
Walsh has made him as popular with
the whole student, body- as it did
with -his- closer associates, his team-
mates. Notre Dame has confidence
in her big center and finds her new
football captain most--satisfactory.
Notre Dame’s wonder team of next
year will be guided by capable
hands—and a blonde^iead.
If you “wonder what a newly
elected football captain thinks
about” try the personal acquaint-
ance, method; the DAILY could not
elaborate upon his modest “I have
nothing, to say.” And it refuses to
fake' a" “sand lot” 'football story.
“Congratulations, Adam!”
men were awarded their positions
in accordance with the number of
votes they "were given.
Although there were no unani-
mous selections, the cases of many
players paralleled the situation in
the varsity football ranks, in which
great difficulty presented itself in
selecting the men best fitted for the'
positions. Particularly was this true
in the backfield -where Mouch of
Badin, Reidy of Brownson, and
Nyikos of the Dodgers constituted
a near deadlock, the trio having
been the best backfield performers
in the Interhall league.
The line is' composed of a pair of
fast ends whose defensive and of-
fensive work has been a revelation
all fall. The tackles are filled with
two men, one of the heavy, rugged
type and the other of the fast,
agile brand; both men displaying
ultra-aggressiveness. Similar re-
marks. can be applied to the guard
positions, which are filled by two of
the most capable men in the Inter-
hall; ranks. Stanhope at center,
who has also played three years of
hair football, acquired his position
by virtue of-his all-around value to
his team. His work in the pivot po-
sition was the mainstay of the
■Walsh team arid his only competitor
was Haecker of Badin, .who was
awarded the guard because of his
brilliant playing qualities in every
game.	." J
