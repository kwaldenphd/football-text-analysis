Spanish Club To Be
Organized Monday
Under the sponsorship of Father
McKeon, head. of the Spanish de-
partment, ",a Spanish club is about
k be,formed on the campus.-. Two
. dosed meetings have already7 been
held; by /those who are. organizing j
the club, and future plans have
been outlined. . The- S. A. C. and
the faculty have given their official
!anctiqh to the club, and it is now
open to al! who. wish to join. 4 The
first-' open meeting will be held on
Monday at 12:30 in the south room
committee in. charge, following a
series of wires between the Junior
class and the Detroit Athletic club,
where he is playing, under exclusive
contract. This practically completes
arrangements for the dance, as all
other contracts have , been let.
Jean Goldkett’s orchestra has
had a rapid rise in the musical
J, world and, is-said to be much sought
after to play dances in all parts of
the country. He has just lately
contracted to make a series of rec-
ordiz-jD^the^Victpr. -people;..and,
which will be .bn‘sale. in\ the 'very
hear future. / Goldkette has played
. the big Michigan “J”-hops for the
- past three years, and has been ex-
ceptionally well received.
Introduces Novelties
The orchestra is composed of 12
of the best musicians in the west.
They have been playing together
for,the past three years and for that,
reason their orchestrations are al-
| most perfect. Goldkette, himself,
plays the piano, and his solos are a
feature.
.One of.the novelties that the or-
chestra will introduce is the lately
copyrighted song-hits, “Smile' All
the While,” written and 'arranged
by Gerald Hassmer of the Junioi'
class^ . Hassmer has already won
recognition by his numbers; “Say,
Say, Sadie” and “Desert Moon.”

Vive M. Poincare
Whether one sympathizes with
the policy of ,the man, no one can
but be sorry that such an able and
courageous statesman as M. Poin-
care has been forced to resign from
the premiership of France. The en-
couraging note of the affair is that
President Millerand has requested
M. Poincare to form a new cabinet
and once again take over the reins
of office. France owes more than
she can ever pay to this man, .whose
devotion to her interests and safety
has been unstinted, both during the
war and the period of reconstruc-
tion. The republic will never fall
as long as such men continue to
guide its destinies. Vive M. Poin-
care.—Daily Princetonian.

NORTHWESTERN U N I V E R-
SITY—Fifty high school men repre-
senting Chicago and suburban high
schools were entertained by North-
western students recently at a stag
party. The affair was a success in
its purpose to acquaint the boys
with Northwestern university.
THE .DAILY'S STAND FOR NOTRE DAME
’ A union building to be built as soon as possible.
A ‘well-organized student body, residing on the campus.
True recognition of good scholarship and a better appreciation
for the efforts of men in campus activities.	.
With the appearance on the campus of organizations chartered by
the national committees of the two outstanding political parties, poli-
tics both local and national, bid fair to take a place among the leading
campus activities. This should be' regarded with enthusiasm by the
undergraduate body^ regardless of party /affiliation, .because of the
inestimable good that comes out of an investigation of the principles
of each.
The college man • of today is weak in knowledge of the political
issues whereas he should be among the best informed in his community.
This is probably due to the lack of genuine interest, because most men
are-willing, to be a Democrat if their father was one, or a Republican
i because / a:. distant ^relative, . was, a _delegate,-in-the_cpunty,_.convention
. back in the nineties.
With the advantages at hand to ,learn both sides of the principal
questions of the day, combined with the opportunities that the Repub-
■ lican and Democratic clubs of Notre Dame offer to hear the foremost
men of the nation, every student should avail himself of the. chances
offered. With a mind free from the influence of the soap box orator
he should, attend the meetings of both clubs and thereby equip himself
to talk intelligently and vote intelligently when the occasion presents
itself.	'	■ -
In a recent number of the Catholic Art Bulletin, the official organ
of the Federation of Catholic Arts, there is presented a strong appeal
for art training in college because of its great value as an educational
study and its usefulness in later life;. The writer, George C. Nimmons,
in showing that such training gives a most useful means of self-expres-
sion that can not be acquired in any other way, says:
“The faculty of taste is the sense of the power to discern and
appreciate beauty, order, proportion, symmetry, and good color, and
the fitness and appropriateness of things is an important trait of
human character which can only be acquired by art training. One of
the most prominent qualities in the personality of an individual is his
standard of taste- . . . . . -r'Even courtesy and human kindness are
stimulated and increased by good taste; for selfishness anti bad man-
i ners are-ugly, and anyone who has.a keen sense of what is beautiful
and good naturally avoids disagreeable manners and bad .treatment of
-others, aside from the moral questions involved.
x “By training in art and the development of standards of taste,
the ability to judge and estimate the character of others is acquired.
. . .. . . And it is often by the works of art that the historian judges
the people of the past more than by any written record. A student,
therefore, who studies art will find it a valuable aid in the study of
history, and a useful means of judging the. character of the people of
his own day.” !	.	. .
In these days of growing protest against education which does not
educate, the, observations of Mr. Nimmons are worthy of consideration.
And while it is impossible for all students to take an art course, it is
possible for each student to make some effort to come to a better appre-
ciation of art. One way of making such an effort, would be the reading
of. Great Christian Artists,”^y;Reverend E. F. Garesche, S. J.

ates of the universities, colleges and

character of their work that they
could with advantage undertake or

tional institutions either in this
country or abroad. The committee
in charge desires' to award fellow-
ships to men who, without financial
assistance, would be unable to de-

graduates will be welcome, but any
award to a senior will be conditioned
upon his being graduated.

GAMES FOR TODAY AND
TOMORROW
The fight for places on the var-
sity baseball nine is nearing a cli-
max as the time for departure on
’ the southern jaunt nears, and two
practice games. this week-end will
■ go far to determine who will be se-
lected to make lip the party of 16
men to be taken on the tour.
, . Coach Keogan expects to send
his men against a group of South
Bend players on the diamond south
of the gym this afternoon, and the
Indestructo Trunk team of Misha-
-waka is carded for an appearance
Sunday afternoon.	, .
Leave on Thursday '
■ The squad will leave for Atlanta,
Ga., next Thursday, and will play
its first regularly scheduled game
on Friday against Georgia Tech.
Eight games are on the list, and the
men will return to South Bend on
Easter Sunday.
/ Excellent weather conditions the
last couple of days have enabled
Keogan to send his aspirants
through short practice games
against each other, and thus test
the ability of the men under fire,
While many defects are noticeable,
the squad appears to have the ma-
terial for a fast club.
Pitchers Working
Probably the most interesting tus-
sle that is being waged for positions
fe-among the pitchers, a dozen men
being engaged in stiff competition
for the regular staff. This has been
generally feared to be the most
troublesome problem facing Keo-
gan, but the earnest work of -the
men .may serve to make things a
bit easier..
Scrimmage will be in order for
spring football candidates this aft-
ernoon, Coach Rockne remaining
at Notre Dame to supervise the
work despite the fact that the track
squad meets DePauw. there today.
It will be the first strenuous
workout of the spring session and is
in line with Rockne’s policy of
teaching his men as much about the
game as possible in spring to en-
able him to move quickly to the
fine points in the fall.
The scrimmage session will not be
a long one but an opportunity will
be given a majority of the candi-
dates to get into the mixup for. a
short time.

REQUESTS GRID TOGS
Coach Knute Rockne yesterday
afternoon issued a call for all foot-

should be turned in at the gymnas-

months before the American Olym-
pic track team leaves for France,
the prospects for a point-winning
aggregation to represent the United
States has been the chief topic of
discussion among , the sport critics
of the country.
Davis Walsh recently made some
very interesting observations on a
few of the candidates for the Amer-
ican team. His. outlook of course
was confined to star performers in
athletic clubs and . collegiate rec-
ord holders, since’the Olympic trials
soon to be staged in various parts
of the country, promise to bring' out
some college material equally as
good as the veterans of the track I
whose consistent showings have lab-
eled them as certain Olympians.
In many respects the indoor sea-
son for Joie -Ray, premier American
miler and dependable two-miler,
has been a'failure. Ray turned in
one good race during the entire
season which means that he only
broke one record. A comparison of
Ray’s indoor work with that of
Nurmi of Finland and Wide of
Sweden, falls so far short of an
even break that it would be only
matter of four minutes and ten
seconds to prove to Ray that his
trip/ abroad had been a mistake.
However, the Windy City flash is
yet apt to disprove the sport oracles
and turn in some record time on
the cinders. Ray’s best time for the
season was 4:18 3-5, registered
when he won the Hunter mile.
Ray Watson, who figured as the
best half miler in the world in
1923, has gone into a slump through
being overtrained. Jimmy Connel-
ly, former Georgetown star chalked
up 4:17 4-5 on the boards during
1923, but during the past season he

Two More Weeks of
Football for Tigers
Spring football for the Princeton
Tigers will continue for. two more
•weeks, Coach Roper announced this
week, and will have to be discon-
tinued at that time because of the
warm weather. The squad has been
out eight days now. The spring
session, though short, is giving the
Jungletown mentor a fair oppor-
tunity to get acquainted’with some
of the new men who have reported
this spring.
In so far as veterans are con-
cerned, the Tigers will have no
great amount of worry, as they
have a- nucleus around which to
build the 1924. team. The work
during the past few days has been
confined to. the rudiments of the
game ' such as falling on the ball, .
