VALUES AND VAPID VAPORINGS
Charles M. Schwab tells a story about a bricklayer whose daugh-
ter wanted to study Greek. To arrange for the lessons, the bricklayer,
he says, went to a college professor and had almost completed arrange-
ments when a dispute, arose over the cost. ,The professor asked as
much for an hour’s tutoring, we are told, as the bricklayer received for
laying bricks. The bricklayer .was indignant. He left in anger, and
sneered at the idea of teaching being worth as much as masonry. “Bosh!”
he said.	‘
■ -Some students wlio hear the story laugh, and make- smart com-
ments on the attitude of the bricklayer. But the same students are as
narrow-minded as the man who'worked with bricks and'mor tar.
In our scheme of civilization the mason is as important as the
professor, the seamstress is as important as the poet.' Arguments, over
the comparative values of courses of study are foolish. The disputes
as to the merits of Law and Commerce areddle harangues.
■‘To make up a world we must have scientists, business men, jour-
nalists, poets, historians, engineers, religious, and all else, even lawyers.
To explain further—your room-
mate, your friend, your friend’s
roommate, all have favorite songs.
These songs are sung or whistled
more than any others he knows.
Send them in, and it will help us
get a line on his activities—social
and otherwise.

GENTLEMANLINESS _______________________
Everyone lias heard of the bull in the china closet; . everyone can
imagine what happens when a group of elephants play tag in a green-,
house, but the smashing, wounding tactics of some fifty Notre Dame
students at the last Scholarship Club dance surpassed either of these.
It is understood that mostly freshmen patronize these dances and that
Notre Dame is not truly represented by its freshmen, but even a first-
year man should have the gentlemanly instincts and rudimentary prin-
ciples which , distinguish the college man. This editorial, to be clear
at the beginning, is an attempt to instruct those fifty men, who at the
•last Scholarship Club dance at the Palais Royale, when asked to dance
. with a young lady, quizzed the chaperone as to her appearance, danc-
ing ability, and in some cases, demanded a sight of the prospective
partner.
' It was Newman who said that a gentleman is one who never need-
lessly causes pain. It is to be wondered, in the light of the action of
, these men who forget their inherent courtesy, just how'far such men
could measure up to this definition. -' It does cause pain to permit a
number of young ladies to grace a wall throughout an evening; it does
■ wound a sensative nature to be inspected and appraised as to looks,
dancing. ability and personality, and the young man who would cause
a lady this, pain (and let us be thankful there are few such.men at
Notre Dame), cannot be: said to be a gentleman. ..
The Notre Dame man is inherently and predominantly gentle-
manly and courteous. He understands the worthiness’of the work
which, the Scholarship Club is performing and realizes the laudable
action of the girls who consent to attend these dances. When brought
to his attention, he is certain to remedy the condition which not only
his reason but his sense of decency will condemn. Then too, this is but
one. side of the question. There are undoubtedly many of the girls
who are too discrirbinating, too prone to judge by externals. . Of these
there is. no need to speak; they deserve neither, ink nor type; they are
probably young and will learn.
The complaint, it seems, rests mostly against the men of the.fresh-
. man class, though experience would tell one that the freshmen are
often accused of acts performed by men with a ’24 or a ’25 after their
z names, and a freshman cast of mind in the head on. their shoulders.
. In these modern times, however, when high school-children have their
weekly hops, it would be presumed that Notre Dame’s recent addition,
the freshman class, would know the proper manner of procedure at a
dance. Surely.it is not gentlemanly to make tours of inspection through
the ranks of their prospective partners, casting aside i chaperones’ sug-
gestions with the manly remark, “Can she dance well?,’’ “Let’s see
her,” and similar gentlemanly-utterances. '
The men.who patronize the Scholarship Club dances will no doubt
/ remedy the condition which is. causing so much’ discouragement to the
ladies of-the organization. ;The Notre Dame gentleman would hot
wound a hand; extended to greet and help him;, then men, let it.be
courtesy,? and the utmost consideration for the/Scholarship Club of
Notre Dame. .'	‘	. 1	; .	' .	"	’ . '	7

Editor of NOTRE DAME DAILY:
Canes and why we have them at
Notre Dame:
The cause is jealousy. Although
I am not a seniorr I know that
many seniors—for they said so—
voted for canes not because they
wanted to carry a cane, but because
they were angered at the lawyers’
assumption that they alone, the
superb •• lawyers, were entitled to
carry canes; that they, having first
landed on the brilliant idea, were
the rightful wielders of the small
stick.
Jealousy, powerful emotion,
caused the canes.
And I know whereof I speak.
Absolutely,
It
WAFO.
To the Editor.of the DAILY:
School statistics show well in ex-
cess of 250 seniors. The sale of
canes show almost 200 who in a
burst of enthusiasm bought canes.
Our vision shows about two who
have weathered the general . burst
of enthusiasm and retained courage
enough to flaunt their .caries in the
eyes of the world. . .
Of, that inconsequential minority
who did not buy. canes we might
roughly divide them into conscien-
cious objectorrs, whom we will pass
by, and those who fear ridicule in
introducing a new vogue but who
will get canes later if the idea is
successfully launched.
. Of the great, hestitating majority
who have bought canes, they are
readily divided into the two that
wear their canes, and the approxi-
mately 198 who believe in using
theirs for wall decorations.
The Senior class as a whole ap-
parently lacks the cohesive solidity
which pervades the senior law divis-
ion and which 'made their adaption
of canes a. success., Up to the. pres-
ent Jtime the senior class as a whole
Has been' undble to put! "the cane
wearing vogue across.
What seems to be lacking is-the’
educational publicity which must go
with the general introduction of
each new idea. It. is easier to fol-
low an ,old tradition than -make .a
new one; it is.easier to be lead than
to lead., ...	> .
It is facing the facts when we
admit that the present time among
the sans culotte canes carry two.as-
sociations. The associations that,
commonly go with canes are those
of foppishness, and effeteness. It is
in the correcting of these impres-
sions that educational publicity has
its use. It is'narrow provincialism
in us that makes us think that canes
are used only by the maimed, the
halt, and the blind, or that they can

AT THE BLACKSTONE
If one is inclined to crumple one’s
hat when excited; we suggest a
steel helmet in hand when seeing
«Red Lights.” To say that the pic-
ture is a good example of spectacu-
lar melodrama is only to confer our
poverty-stricken vocabulary.
Perhaps somewhere in the above
has crept a hint that “Red Lights”
is an’extraordinary detective story
well done. Such is exactly the case.
Let Mr. Raymond Griffith take a
bit of this praise unto himself. As
a “crime deflector” he is perfect.
Now Marie is one of those hand-
some young ladies who, when,
frightened, calls forth all those
higher instincts in men which spell
protection. The frequent reap-
pearance of the hand, as mysterious
as it is hairy, in the proximity of
her pretty neck, nearly flogged our
poor nerves to pieces.
Miss Prevost makes a very de-
lightful sweetheart, we would ven-
ture to say.;. So will you.
“ Occasionally we see a picture
which, improves generally our
“movie morale.” . This is one of
them.'	<

Oh, .it’s girls, girls, girls. . Yes,

is always a dear unassuming 'little

contrary or revolutionary our au-
thor has found it proper to have her
fall in love with a rich young man.
The rich young man has a guardian.
Odd isn’t it? . Wyndam Standing
is the uncle. He is a, good type for
the part, being just weak enough,
or human enough, to become en-
snared himself.

with a display of loud kid gloves.
As a truism, it may be stated that
the farther west one goes the less
one sees of canes.
In London, as is true in all of
the old capitals of the occidental
world, canes are very common
among the intellectual classes, in-
cluding students, artists, literary
men, diplomats, and all members
of the intellectual aristocracy. It
is indisputable that canes,. more
than any article of dress, are pecu-
liarly related to the mind. Canes
the world over are invariably an
accompaniment of learning, chiv-
alry'and culture.
To those seniors whose canes now
form a part of the interior decora-
tions of their room, it is suggested
that they use their' canes for the
purpose.for which'-.they were orig-
inally acquired and that they buy
an N. D.. pillow to overcome the
.bareness caused by the removal of
the cane. To those who have not
yet purchased canes the suggestion
is extended that they forgo their
natural modesty and overcome their
retiring nature to the extent of in-
vesting two dollars in a cane with
which to stalk among the intellec-
tuals of “Old N. D.”

IRISH CAGEMEN
PLAY SATURDAY
Keogan’s Men Ready for Minnesota;
Five Big Ten Teams on Sched-
ule; Sixteen Home Games.
Due to a late start and a strenu-
ous schedule, Coach Keogan has been
putting his -basketball proteges
. through stiff workouts every after-
noon at the “Y.” The Notre Dame
cagemen will journey to Minneapo-
lis Saturday where they, will play
Minnesota in the first game of the
season.	.	.
The schedule for 1923-24 appears
to be the hardest ever undertaken
. by the Irish basketeers. Five con-
- ference teams are included in the
list. Michigan and Northwestern
. will come to South Bend, while
Minnesota, Illinois, and .. Indiana
games will be played at Minneapd-
lis, Urbana and Bloomington, re-
spectively.
• These five are among the- leading
teams in'the Big Ten, and they are
expected to offer no small amount
of opposition. Franklin and Wa-
bash also appear on the schedule.
Franklin proved to be one t of the
strongest teams in the state last
year.	.	■
. When the Irish play Creighton at
Omaha, they will meet one of the
best fives in the country. Creigh-
, ton has been the sensation in'bas-
. ketball circles for the past few,
years. The western. aggregation
boasts of another” Chuck Kearney,
. and a man of Kearney’s calibre will
• give any team trouble. ;
The sixteen home games will be
- played at the Y. M. C. A. Coach
Keogan does not favor 'switching
from 5yood to a dirt floor.
■ Practically all of the veterans arei
practicing and Coach Koegan is
optimistic- as to the coming season.

The football classic of the year” is
the story of the tackle who was big,
powerful, and fast—except above
the ears. He was told exactly what
to do to stop a play run off by an
opposing eleven from kickoff to for-
mation. The play was tried in the
second quarter. .	. ;
“Here you,” our hero suddenly in-
formed his opponents before the
signal had been completed, “you’re
in the wrong place; your team is in
kick formation.” - , ,	. :
Andy Smith, coach of the Uni-
versity of California team, says that
650 candidates reported for the first
football practice of ,1923. Coach
