for its members ‘ about May 22 in

man journalism; class in the jour-
nalism. room. of. the library.
< Formerly,- it had been the inten-.
. tion of members. of the group, to
give a smoker on the campus.
However, the proposal was / made
by James Jones, a member of the
class, that ‘^The Cubs” give a more,
impressive affair that, would serve
as the final. function of the class.

jority.' ■	' /■'' ■ !.	'I. '’' v ■

lications, will deliver short dis-
' courses. The names of these men

bable that a musical program will

Summer Arrives at The University; ■;
Freshmen Alone Are Out o f Season
No better proof can be had that
warm weather is'here than' to see
the gang in swimming. /The proof
has. been, furnished., Quite a numr
ber- of students dove into St.
Joseph Jake during ’ the ; warm
hours recently^ Some declared the.
water was fine, others, shiyeringly.
said ’that it was/freezing. But
judging from the enjoyment that
was seemingly had\- by all' who
visited the old swimming hole the
water - must have been pretty good.
White 'Shirts Back.
Another . convincing proof, that
summer is herb is that white sirts
are once more in vogue. To the
moth .balls? with , the A faithful old
sheep-skins and the rest of the
paraphernalia necessary to ward off.
the; attacks of Old Man Winter. - .
The strumming- of guitars and
the voices of students - singing now
prevails at. about dusk; and\the diq-;
tant rumble of thunder announces
that -w^rm weather and vacation
are fast drawing near.; But school
is not over, and the student drbw-
sily draws himself , out of the shade
of some convenient tree to make'
the next class.	\	'
' Freshmen Out of Season. ,
. Everywhere one looks, green
^greets the eye; even -the steps of
St. Edward’s hall are being painted
green; ’ The only' creatures out of
season are the freshmen. They are
fast, maturing; turning. brown, and
will soon be sophomores. But then i
freshmen always have; to be. dif-
ferent -from everything . else. In
the. year when everything else is
turning brown and faded,'they are
as green as the grass .on a summer
morning.	,	.	,	'

POPULARITY.
If men were rational democracy would be a wonderful system for
government.	?
But are men rational when they vote for men they know but. as “a
good fellow,” if they^know him at all? If they vote for a man because
Bob suggested it, and “Bob is a good friend of mine”? .
. Such “rationality” has controlled Notre Dame elections and con-
trols elections everywhere, but its presence elsewhere excuses it no-
where.: Popularity elects more men than capability. If you elect a man
just because you know of him, not because you know what you can ex-
pect of him, you. and you only, are to blame if officers are/not found

AMERICAN.
' After one hundred aild- fifty formative years/an American type
. and spirit has evolved., This type and spirit has begun to appear in
our literature in the character'of a man essentially businesslike whose
characteristic is energy and whose idea of the worthwhile is something
substantial, practical, tangible—the factory as opposed to the art gal-
lery. ....	■	<	■	’	•’ >-	'
. Most markedly expressive of this new American is his'architecture,
The. architecture of the skyscraper, and most typical of this .kind of ar-
chitecture is -the Shelton hotel in New York, a bulky* massif mohu-*
mental stone.	’
The new architecture .is the American spirit in actual form—mas-
sive, strong, towering,' proud—magnificient stone cnclo^irig powerful
steel. Some of our newest skyscrapers are not American.' Many of
them; like the Tribune building in Chicago, are Gothic, a type better
suited for churches with their spires piercing the heavens. In that-com-
petition the second prize went to. a Finn, whose, suggestion was truly’
American, “a soaring, daring creature, leaping proudly by tiers into the
air, without so much as, one stone gargoyle to chain it to the world’s
Gothic past—steel construction carried to its logical, untrammeled,
architectural up and down conclusion.” .	- ■ , .
• This is the true American architecture. It is the true expression of
distinctive Americanism.	\	.'
. ENTER GOD!

' Many men have put it down in their mental notebooks that- there
•is, no God.' They planned their little play. Scene'by scene, act by act,
they built their lives, moulded their destinies. In their play they had a
place for Love, for Fate, for Work, for Money, for Education. They
worked in with subtle deftness each situation. There was ho hitch in
the .drama; It would be played, to the end, with themselves Hamlets

They forgot, in tlieir effort for continuity, an essential element; a

What Others Say
James Martin, sport editor of the
Bachelor, of Wabash College re-
cently published the following ar-
ticle :
“With Notre Dame out of the
way—we don’t play them again this
season—we must beat Butler, State
Normal, Purdue and Indiana in or-
der to talk the Indianapolis, papers
into giving us the credit for the
state title. State Normal is in
great form and so is the team that
will bear the most watching. In-
diana, DePauw, and Rose Polly are
practcially out of the , race now'.
Another defeat for Purdue means
their exit. Franklin has been going .
great, of late, but their pitching
staff will probably ■ not hold up.
Dame Fortune, Madame Luck, and
Santa Claus will keep Butler in the
race. Notre Dame doubtless will
go through the rest of its schedule
undefeated so that the Scarlet can-
not affovd to be beaten. Keep them
going, Harry! .
The Blackstone photoplay this
week must appeal to all those
who are strong for the great open
spaces, because ‘‘Hoot? Gibson is
featured in ^‘Forty Horse Haw-
kins,” a tale of. the west. As for
the vaudeville, Raymond Fagan
with his ten piece Symphonic Or-
chestra, is the headliner. Others,
on the program are -The Lampinis,
a' comedy illusion, and Grace Cam-
eron, who specializes in bits of
comic opera. Beginning next Wed-
nesday, “No Mother To Guide
Her” will be the photoplay.

Meet Purple Here
WALSH AND BADIN FIGHT
FOR LEAGUE LEADERSHIP
The next attraction on the Notre
Dame baseball schedule for the
home grounds will be the engage-
ment with the Northewestern Uni-
versity nine on Cartier field to-
morrow afternoon at 4 o’clock.
This will be the first meeting of
the Irish, and Purple diamond
squads this year, an early season
game having been cancelled due to
inclement weather.
The Purple squad has enjoyed
nothing less than, an uphill fight
since, the season opened and its
many reverses will only serve to
make it a fighting aggregation. The
Northwestern nine is reputed to be
a collection of heavy hitters and
more • than once in the conference
games since the season opened,
have the Purple players demon-
strated their', eagle eye for the
horsehide, only to lose out through
ragged field play. The Chicagoans
dropped an 8 to 4 game, to In-
diana last Monday and followed
that .with a loss to Michigan, the
latter being tied with Illinois for*
conference leadership. Northwest-
ern’s pitching staff has been the
problem of the Evanston mentor all
season, but he has developed two
effective twirlers whose offerings
The Interhall games on this
week’s calendar will produce the
greatest effect on the league stand-
ing of any of the games that
have been played so far. When
Walsh and Badin meet, both teams
will be fighting for the top position.-
At present the Walshites are set-
ting the pace with four victories,
but a defat at the hands of Badin
would put them into second place.
“ The Carroll-Brownson contest al-
so promises speed. Carroll is trail-
ing its dorm neighboi’ by half a
game, and will attempt to oust
Brownson from third place. Cad-
illac will encounter the Frosh crew,
Sorin will meet Corby and Sopho-
more will take the field against the
Off-campus team.

With the approach of the date
for the Olympic trials in various
parts of the country, the interest
in the great international event
heightens and the American track
team will leave the United States
next month bidden to victory by a
national feeling such as has never
been aroused before preliminary to
a great athletic meet. ,	". . \
Prominent track mentors in this
country are imperturbable in their
opinion that the American colors
will triumph at the Columbes sta-
dium this summer. Among the
events that have been conceded to
the Americans by popular acclaim
are the 100 and 2po meters run,
the 400 meters relay, 110 and 400
meters hurdles, the running high
jump and the throwing of the 56
pound weight and the 16 pound
hammer.
Three of the American conten-
ders in the heavy weight field
events are members of' the ' New
York police force. The javelin men
from this country are slated' to
meet remarkable competition from
Myra, of Finland. Lieb, Pope and

Tennis, ‘golf and swimming are
three branches of sport worthy of
being elevated to the. major* sport
rank. For pure skill and accuracy
tennis and golf stand out in a mark-
ed degree, and swimming is a stern
mistress, exacting the most rigor-
ous training rules. These sports,
unfortunately, are classed in the
minor field though the demarcation
is unfair.	' ’
Charley Paddock, “fastest hu-
man,”- will run a series of exhibi-
tion sprints in the Big Ten track ,
and' field meet which will be held
on Stagg Field, June 7. Paddock’s
Chicago appearance will give Big
Ten fans an opportunity to see the
greatest dash man in history at his
best. He will, stop off at Chicago
on his way to Harvard to compete .
in the final Olympic tryouts.
In the Olympics held at Antwerp
four years ago, Paddock won both
dashes and was a member of the .
victorious American relay team.

A Hoot Gibson production of superior grade, sure to please all .that

The plot possesses infinite dash and variety, switches from Wcst-

. excellent burlesque hits, takng off the old-time, cheap melodrama'

What They Say
The Cussedness of Cussing.
If students possessed neither
breeding nor culture, belonged to
the great unwashed, and had no
’more sense . of propriety and • de-
cency than the veriest of common
laborers reared in the worst of en-
• vironments, it would be quite dif-
, ferent. ‘ But students. do possess
culture and .breeding, though there
~ ' are moments when one doubts this,
. and have a	good sense of proper
.	conduct, though often underexer-
'	cised. The	individual most easily
reaches this	conclusion by listening
to the conversations 'that take place
on the campus and in the Latin
. quarter, and noting the super-abun-
dance of profanity. Not that an
occasional “damn” or “hell” or
even worse now and then is unfor-
giving (wrong, for it is not..,A blue-
tinged word now’ and then may
quite easily be asserted as good for
the best of constitutions, and there
-is. nothing so very wrong about it.
, - But when the names of the Sa-.
- vior and of the Deify are invoked1
repeatedly in ordinary friendly con-
. 7 versation, something is wrong.
■ When strong -oaths and . obscene
words are used for introductory ex-
pletives for sentence after sen-
: fence, .when every change of inter-
est, attention, surprise, dislike,
pleasure, and every other: quality
. of conversation is marked by pro-
fanity, surely, something, is lacking
in the'way of good conduct. To be
sure, the use of profanity is always
\ ,a matter of individual taste, but
even so that fact does not license
the‘individual to thrust his profan-
- ,ity upon the attention.'of others, as
■ is too much the case now. ' There is
neither sense nor'good taste in the
continual use: of profanity; it lends,
"■ neither strength nor character to
one’s utterances; it marks, rather,
' a weakness and a slavishness to a
- silly ’ habit.—The Daily Cardinal.

QUESTION OSBORNE’S STYLE.
The “western roll” used by Har-
old Osborne, former Illinois high
jump star arid now a contender for
a place on the American Olympic
team, has been questioned by a
member of the French athletic com-
mission, whose suspicions .as to fhe
legility of the style were raised
by an American newspaper article
which described Osborne’s jump..
The . American member of the
Olympic athletic commission has
caused an investigation to be made
of the jumping style in question
and reports that the' method is
legal. The riiatter has been placed
in the hands of the international
athletic federation.
The method used by the. former
Illinois star who is<now competing
under the colors of the I. A._ C., is
referred to by the French athletic
officials as a “dive,” in which the
head and arms go over the bar be-
fore the rest of the body. Also,
the jumper’s left arm touches and
they,are under the.impression that
steadies the bar as. he goes over.
The so-called “western roll” has
been used by Osborne and many of
his field rivals in big meets throug-
out the country. Osborne has jump-
ed in this style in all the conference
meets, A. A. U. national and sec-
tional meets, and until the protest
made by the French officials, his
style was . never questioned. -
Johnny Murphy, Notre Dame’s
great high jumper during 1920-21,
employed a jumping style that was
far removed from any possible
question as to its legality. Murphy
crossed the bar feet first.
Osborne will compete in the
Illinois interscholastic meet at Ur-
bana next Saturday in an attempt
sanctioned by the A. A. U. to lower
the world’s record? Russel, a for-
mer Illinois high jumper will com-
pete against Osborne. ,	• 7 \

Fewer Bambinos in
■ Big Ten This Year
The home run total in the con-
ference • baseball ranks is not
mounting so fast as it did last year.
Whether the pitching has improved
or the batting power has decreased
cannot be .readily ascertained, since
the good batsmen and good pitchers
in the conference are fairly well
divided among the ten schools. .
Captain Blott of Michigan, For-
kel of Chicago and DeArmand 'of
Purdue top the home run list in the
Big Ten with two four baggers
each. Out of the sixty men who
have placed on the batting average
list, the percentage- of which runs
as low as .250,' only two men are
batting 1.000. Cameron of Ohio
State, and Ponting of Illinois' are
the two men who have reached first
every time they came to bat.
