Father Burns Back
from Western Trip
Rev. James Burns, C. S. C., pres-
ident emeritus of the University,
returned Thursday from an ex-
tended trip to the Pacific coast. He
was absent? from the university for
over three months. His purpose
in making the trip was to interest
the friends and alumni of Notre
Dame in the two million dollar
building endowment fund now be-
ing subscribed. According to
Father Burns, the response to his
appeal was highly satisfactory.
When he left the plans for the
drive were going forward under
capable hands .
Father Burns renewed student
day friendship in Denver, Los An-
geles, San Francisco, Portland, and
Seattle. Everywhere he went he
was especially impressed with the
interest shown in the Notre Dame
football team.
Followers of the sport in Cali-
fornia were deeply disappointed at
Notre Dame’s defeat by Nebraska
but even more so by their refusal
to appear in Los Angeles in a post-
season game. No other eleven is
in such demand for 1925 appear-
ance against California, Father
Burns says.
But even so I think I could make
the ’’Line” in the w. k. W. G. N.
since I’ve discovered the secret:
Merely write in and ask R. H. L.
why in thunderation doesn’t he pub-
lish your contributions.

Scribblers to Hear
Father O’Donnell
On Monday evening The Scrib-
blers ■will assemble for the long-ex-
pected poetry treat of the year—
■Father Charles O’Donnell’s talk on
“Poetry and Some Modern Poets.”
The Scribblers are still talking
about Father O’Donnell’s talk of
last year, at which he spurred to
further efforts some now-prominent
campus versifiers that might other-
wise have despaired of their poetic
possibilities.
—At.-^is -meeting—
will read a paper, and all Scribblers
who . have any original verse will
submit it for Father O’Donnell’s
criticism.
Library Entertains
Strange Guest
Students in the library yester-
day morning were disturbed by
numerous healthy peals of laugh-
ter. emitting from the foyer. Upon 1
investigation it was found that the
merriment proceeded from some
twenty-five gentlemen who were
watching volunteers chasing an owl
about in vain attempts to capture
him.
Directed by Fathers Foik and
McNamara, the volunteers contin-
ued the pursuit. But evidently the
owl had decided not to surrender
so long^ as there were lamps to
light.on.
“Blind the poor beast,” suggested
Father McNamara . The lights were
then turned on, ladders were se-
cured, and a- gentleman from Mish-
awaka, evilently acquainted with
owl-ology, ascended the ladder to
effect the seizure. Obviously the
owl was not of the exclusively
“night” species, for he flew away,
just in time to escape the ex-
tended hand of his would-be captor.
Someone then produced a flashlight
and -with the aid of this Mr. Owl
was arrested.’
The bird was discovered early
yesterday morning in the south
wing, blinking philosophically from
his ierch on Soe/atos’ bust. Upon
an attempt being made to cage him
he flew up to one of the lights.
A good time was had by the
audience.
Team’s First Appearance of Season Is,
Marked by Easy Win; Milbauer and
Johnson Win Monograms.
Coach Rockne’s , Notre Dame
track team, making their first ap-
pearance of the 1924 season,
scored an easy victory over the- Pur-
ple team from Northwestern, 52 3-4
to 33 1-4, in the Irish gym yesterday
afternoon. The Blue and Gold gar-
nered five first places and a second
place in every other event, picking
up all their high points in the
sprints, hurdles, quarter mile, half
mile and shot . put.
• The feature event of the meet
was the mile run won by Martin,
the Purple’s star performer, from
Paul Kennedy, the Irish leader,
who had paced the visiting speed
merchant nearly all the way. Mar-
tin displayed a remarkable endur-
ance and combined -with his terrific
burst of speed at the finish, the Pur-
ple star rode over the tape a win-
ner in 4:27 2-10. Kennedy grabbed
a wide lead for the first two' laps,
but the Purple runner began to-pick
up ground, and pushed the 'Irish
leader hard for the next eight laps,
when he"uncorked a flash of speed,
and raced past the fighting Irish-
man, beating him to-the tape by
four yards. The gym record set in
1910 is 4:26 2-10.

Irish Defeated, 5-1, in First Home
...;.A?.D2eB(ie.n.!..Year.;Jticok__
' " — Scores.
Fighting against great odds and
handicapped by the lack of enough
experience to cope with so . formid-
able a rival, the Notre Dame hockey
team lost their first home game
on the St. Mary’s rink to the
I. A. C. of Chicago, 5-1, yesterday
afternoon.
The Irish ice team, have thus far
this season stacked up against two
teams that had theedge all the way
from the point of experience and
class. .The Blue ;and Gold aggre-
gation, however, facing the clever
sextet from Chicago, put up a
fighting game that gave the visitors
more .trouble tbjan they had ex-
pected.	'< ■
The Chicagoans scored three
times during thp; -first period and
again shortly after the second per-
iod-opened. Skinner and Mallory,
playing at the wing and center re-
spectively, were responsible. for the
counters.' .Both men played a prom-
inent part through’the entire game
but met with ;rip little difficulty
against the stick , work of McSor-
ley,’ Magie. and Hicok.
The visitors played a neat pass-
ing game and time^after time raced
down the ice’only to encounter the.
sticks of the defense composed of
Charley Mouch and Norm Feltes.
The Irish enjoyed, no little success
in. getting the puck down to the
opponent’s goal out the air-tight
defense of the Chicagoans made it
impossible to send the puck through
the cage.	-
The second frame opened with
a goal almost immediately after the
players took the ice and then a
riot of action set in as the Irish be-
ban to threaten the I. A. C. cage.
-Near the end of the game, Skinner
counted for another goal but the
Fighting Irish, not to • be outdone
even in the face jof great odds,
chalked up one marker for the
home sextet when . Hicok sent the
puck flying into the visitors, cage.
Although the Irish ice team has
faced opposition far too great for
them, the experience of meeting
with such formidable opponents will
undoubtedly have its value in mak-
ing the McSorley sextet better able
to handle themselves in the remain-

Committee Has Few
-Se n i o r Pins Left
Charles Robrecht, chairman of
the Senior class pin committee, an-
nounced yesterday that there are
15 pins left for distribution. When
these are sold, no more pins will be
purchased by the committee, but
Seniors will have to order their
pins individually from the' fac-
tory at a cost of $16.25, plus
postage. 'The present price is $15.
Seniors wh’o have not as yet bought
pins should do so at once and take
advantage of the reduced price.
> The class, stationery is now on
hand and John Ryan, chairman of
the committee, reports that over
one hundred - boxes have already
been disposed of. This paper is
sold at cost price-to seniors, and
as there are less than 100 boxes
left, it is advised that all seniors
who want paper see John Ryan,
Corby hall, as soon as possible.
Paper may also be obtained from
Hugh Boyle, Sorin, and Charles
DeLaVergne, Walsh.
The Irish speed men garnered
all three places in the 40-yard
dash and landed the first two places
in the high hurdles, won by Adam
Walsh, with Johnny Johnson, “Notre •
Dame’s greatest little athlete” in
second place. Johnson came back
later in the high jump landing sec-
ond place for a total of six points
and a monogram for the afternoon’s •
work.
Milbauer crashed into the ranks
of the monogram ■with' Johnson
when he copped first place in the
shot put with a heave of 39 feet
10 inches. Adam Walsh came in
for second place in this event with
a mark of 39 feet 7 inches.
Wayne Cox won the half mile
event in first class form and staged
another last minute burst of the
speed which gave him a win in the
Illinois meet last year. Kahn, the
Purple entrant, grabbed the lead at
the start of the grind and clung to
it for five laps, when Cox, who had
been traveling in third place be-
hind Andy Conlin, cut loose on the
back stretch and , crossed the tape
eight yards ahead of the Purple
runner. .	'
McTiernan and Hamling in the
440-yard run had the entire race
pretty much their own way; Kelly,
the Purple entrant, never being
able to pass the-flying Irishmen.. ' -
Considering that the Irish tracks-
ters have had but three weeks of
practice, the runners showed to a
very good advantage, and with an-
other month of work before the.
next meet with the Badgers from-
Wisconsin, the local trackmen
should be in the best form. Martin -
sprung a surprise in winning the
mile from the veteran Kennedy,- but
the Purple runner was an excep- J
tionally brilliant track man, and af-
ter entering three events, the Pur- .
pie flash came_ back in the mile re-
lay and turned in the fastest quar-
ter event. The 'visitors -won the
relay in easy fashion after their
lead-off man had gained about a
four-yard lead on Barr.

The profession of playing the
fool is extinct. The privilege is
not. It has rather become a com-
mon right. We are all free to play
the fool, and, as a certain sage re-
marked, in a cynical moment, “it is
easy to ‘make fools of. ourselves’
because we always have plenty of
raw material on hand.”	,
We do not quote this opinion in
a spirit of cynicism, but for a seri-
ous purpose. We believe that the
world is suffering sadly from the
lack of fools. ' Obviously there is
danger of such a statement calling
uct of Psychology. It has become
a lucrative avocation exercised by
skillful men usually on the occa-
sion of legal battles in which wealth
comes to grips with justice. We
have no intention of casting any
slur upon the professional diag-
nostician of sanity. His work, in
se, is legitimate, even laudable. We
merely wished to call attention to
the frequency (increasing) . with
which empty minds seem to emerge
from full pocketbooks.

“CAKE-EATER”—
ITS SYNONYMS AND ANTONYMS -
Oiit of the mass of idiocies which have been spoken and written
within the past few days, comes the astonishing statement from a stu-
dent of Notre Dame that a “Cake-eater” is one who wears “a tie and
a white collar.” Remarkable though this may seem, it is a natural re-
sult of the. agitation .which is giving Notre Dame’s student body a
wrong impression of many things and giving many people a wrong
impression of Notre Dame men and of what they are thinking. The
term “cake-eater” should be obnoxious to the college man’s lips as
-any meaningless, childish word is foreign to the educated person’s
vocabulary.	'
The Notre. Dame man is inherently manly; his is a heritage of
fighters; the very snow which covers his campus reminds him that his
school was hewn from the forest by fighting missionaries who had no
; other coverings in their rude cabins than that same snow. That
these men should permit the word “cake-eater” to pervade their con-
versations and become an issue in their school’s life is rediculous. It
is understood that there are those at Notre Dame who are not manly
—who are soft. But there are many ways of-being soft; many‘ways of
being unmanly; many ways of being a coward; and the apparel, the
.4 manner of talking,..the number of dance's .one attends; ..has, not a great
deal to do with picking out these soft men?\ This matter of being soft
is essentially one of the spirit and the man who can spit tobacco
juice the farthest and who can wear the same flannel shift the longest
is not necessarily the person who has the steel in the backbone where ,
; steel should be.	-
Notre Dame is a school of glorious tradition. She is proud of her
/.founders, of their, tribulations, their poverty and their suffering. Let
not that tradition be clouded now' by talk of unmariliness where un-
manliness does not exist. The trend of Notre Dame’s history arid of
her standard-of men is constantly upward and it is safe to say that
‘ only men remain lorig under the dome and under the influence of the
• sweet Lady who surmounts it. May the term “cake-eater,” it synonyms'
and antonyms, be forever stricken from the conversation of Notre j
Dame men. It is obnoxious.	. ''
The fools we would have are not
simply any bld fools at all, just
downright stupid fplk; These are
common enough because only com-
monly foolish. ' We would have
more of the old-time fools, men
.who make a profession, or at least
cultivate the habit of passing for
fools in order foolishly to educate
the wise. It is humiliating for one
wise man to be 'rebuked by another
wise.man, whereas he would take a
hint and hence a correction if wise
counsel were proposed to him by
the lips of a fool. In the former
case, a remonstrance is interpreted
as an’attempt at claiming superior-
ity, and hence resented as an in-
sult; in the latter, it is regarded
merely as an accident, and there-
fore welcomed as a bit of good for-
tune. ' The world suffers from too
much learning. An over-dose of
information has made it groggy.
There is need of an epidemic of re-
buking, and hence of an invasion of
fools.	1
- Honest fools have disappeared.
The task of discovering them has
become a profession,-—a by-prod-
The-fact is that nowadays men
become fools not so much by choice
as by law. Foolishness has become
scientific, standardized, — almost
respectable. Fools are classified,
card-indexed. Some are foolish
because innocent, others are inno-
cent because foolish; still others
become foolish by due process of
law, in order to become innocent
by mere process of court decisions.
0 for a real fool to rebuke such
foolishness with becoming folly!
One looks to the universities for
professional men. May we not
hope that before; the departmental
craze has wholly subsided that
some generous philanthropist will
establish a Chair of Foolishness, a
course in the science of saving the
wise from the folly of their own
conceits, a course in the - art of
keeping one’s feet on the ground,
a laboratory for experimenting
upon effective methods of inocula-
tion against megacephalis?
The fool has a legitimate place
in . civilization. His contribution
thereto may be qualified as nega-
tive, fortuitous, accidental, super-
ficial, or in any way you please.
But it is valuable, indispensable,
nevertheless. If it be true that
“fools rush in where Angels fear
to tread,” >then it would seem not
inopportune - to welcome their
sweeping stampede. For when wis-
dom oversteps its bounds, com-
mend US to the fools. Fortuna j
favet fatuis.

THE S. O. P. CLUB
It has been coming on for a lorig time. It first manifested itself
only at odd and uncertain times.. Then it seemed to have gathered
force, and finally with the breaking fury of. a storm it has descended
*. uponus as a curse. “It” is Notre Dame’s Invisible (but fast becoming
visible) Empire. It is the smokers’ organization that is called S. O. P.,
:an organization built up for the most part,on good fellowship and
,upon the generosity of friends. Its members are men who say “No; I
don’t smoke. I can leave the stuff alone, but say, I’ll try one of those
; if you-don’t mind.” The S. O. P. stands for Smoke Other People’s.
' These men “don’t smoke,” but if the amount they , “mooch” in a
dayfwas added up it would be a vast vulgar item. They will smoke
■ anything, and they pirove it by their satiety.	(
? ■ Now let us all be social beings/’let us all get in bn this club, and
then when we are all members there will be no,more smoking—or else
• everyone will come back to the fold whose banner is Buy Your Own;
'.and in either event we’ll all be happy once more.

former student in the summer
school here, has ■written an allegor-

Another Interesting English vol-
ume that has Ynade its appearance
on our campus' is a collection of
jpoems by Ford. Madox Hueffer.
The title poem, “One Heaven,” is
dedicated to an individual “who
asked for a working principle of
Heaven.“ Of the poem the author
says, “It expresses what, quaintly
enough, is my [belief 'of what
[Heaven is. If it is a materialist’s
Heaven I can’t help it.”
For all and sundry, coming .down
with a hound by his side.
And so he stood at the cross-roads,
passing the time of day ■
In a great, kind voice, the voice of
• a man and a half!——.
.The other poems in the collec-
tion were," written While, Hueffer
was in active military service. The
volume was published in -London
and while it is not new. it is inter-
esting- because of the fact that
Hueffer is becoming popular in this
country thru his contributions to
of Yale professors and embrace;
such subjects as physics, chemistry,
.astronomy, and kindred subjects.
The collection should be of some
interest to scientific students. '

4 / ZEST FOR WORK
A. college professor once remarked that if the majority of college
/students devoted as much time and energy to their work as they do to
; avoiding it, the annual crop of graduates would go out into the world
?inuch better .prepared, to earn a livelihood. The fault lies in the. lack'
of enthusiasm and in a tendency to do jugt enough to “get by.”
Bluffing is a great American pastime arid it is td some extent justi-
.fiable. The bluffer may get by; he usually does for a time, but when
his bluff is called he has nothing to show. Continual bluffing, a con-
stant endeavor to just “get by,” is nothing more or less than an in-
. vitatipri, a sure road, in fact, to mediocrity. The bluffer may-send his
regrets, but he sends 'them too late.
There is a remedy for-this apathy, one which is not always pleas-
ant at first. It is to make work a recreation. Platitudinous ? It may
be, but it is safe. If one can bring to his work some of the tremen-
dous energy which he expends in social activities, some of the enthus-
iasm with which he takes part in his favorite sport, he has more than
half a chance of succeeding..	-

Editor, The DAILY:
The general run of Notre Dame
men down through the generations
till , today have been marked by
characteristics that can’t ever be
uprooted,—nor should they be.
Tempered perhaps and altered in
those things which are the acci-
dentals, in' substance I believe them
an immutable lot.
There is an .air that is quickly
absorbed here. It is an atmosphere
of swaggering zest for life' from
day to day, a wholesome sort of
lumber-camp spirit of sweat shirt
and corduroy cameraderie. No
shadow of pretension goes into the
'thing, and peeves and dislikes and.
disagreements are promptly and ve-
hemently aired without a thought
or intent of malicious injury.
Much has been stressed on the
democracy of Notre Dame, but any
man from a Jesuit college who has
felt contact with Notre Dame men
will testify that the spirit of Notre
Dame is that of aristocracy. No
.400 of a superior stratum of society
ever presented such a united and
condescending attitude toward those
outside their fortune-favored ranks,
than does this close-knit fraternity
of Notre Dame men toward those
who confess loyalty to other uni-
versities.	-	.
True, there is no appreciable
hierarchy of rank, title, lord, or
self, within the student body, but
when that is the result of every-
one considering himself dubbed
peer by the fact of developing into
:a Notre Dame man it appears that
it is not .a spirit of democracy but
that of ,a universal and swaggering
aristocracy of youth which consid-
ers itself no better or worse than
the rest of Notre Dame men (be-
cause that in itself is ultimate) but
which appraises itself as vastly su-
perior.- to.alLothers outside.the pale,

Editor, NOTRE DAME DAILY:
The question as to whether the
people of South Bend should be
given the preference at basketball
games is being intensely discussed
about the campus. When Notre
Dame played Franklin some time
ago, hundreds of persons were re-
fused entrance into the “Y” gym-
nasium because of inadequate ac-
commodations.- The majority of
the persons, turned away were stu-
dents of the University.
It'is certainly true that one of
the student managers erred • gross-

ly when, during the cramming and
shuffling of the crowds, he re-
marked that the people of South
Bend had as much or more right to
witness the game than did the stu-
dents. South Bend merchants and
townspeople have contributed sup-
port. to Notre Dame teams and ac-
tivities that reflect very creditably
upon them, but this does not en-
dow them with privileges equal to
those of the students in any en-
deavor sponsored by the Univer-
sity. The student has the right
over all to witness Notre Dame
contests since he is a tangible part
of the University. Let him be
served first and be given the pref-
erence. d

Minims Deserve Praise
for Athletic Progress
To the students of Notre Dame,
the achievements of its athletes
have gone down in University his-
tory. The names of Crowley, Mil-
der, Layden, Stuhldreher, and
Walsh ' have been written on the
gridiron of fame. And justly so.
But despite all of this, we have ne-
glected’to pay tribute to the ac-
complishments of “Fighting Irish
'Juniors”—the minims of St. Ed-
ward’s hall.- Even as the school at
which such an athlete as Ward
“Doc” Connell and some others re-
ceived their knowledge of thev pig-
skin and the oval, its teams have
received but little attention.
' Unknown to all, the minims are
experiencing the . most successful
year in basketball. So far their net
squad has participated in two con-
tests and merited two victories. St.
Joseph’s lightweights bowed in de-
feat to the score of 23-11, in the
first contest of the season. The
second game resulted in a 26-6
victory over the. St. Joseph’s heavy-
weights.	\	,
Eugene “Kentucky” Oberst, star
tackle of the varsity football team,
is coach, and from present indica-
tions his team will be as successful*
as that which represented St. Ed-
ward’s in football. The net squad
is composed of Edward Koontz,
Clement Periolat, James Reagan,
R.__Cantilliqn, N/ Guljas,’ Albert
Fransen, Adolph Fransen, acting
captain, Alfred Egan, , H. .Essig,
George Reardon, Frank Horka,
George Bolas, T. Woods, and Ed-
ward McDonald. ",	.
‘ A steady line and a fast back-
field, > bred of. the attention with
which the minims watched the var-
sity perform, paved the way for
their victories during the football
season. Sti- Stevens, Olivers, St.

In the last game of the season
the minims exhibited a game char-
acteristic of the “team” they looked
upon with hero-worship,—Notre
Dame’s Wonder Team of -1923.
With the ball on their 10-yard line,
in the last half, and the score 6-0
against them, the team braced.
Three trick plays, taught by that
native of Owensl oro, Kentucky,
executed with admirable precision,
carried the ball to .the goal posts.
A criss-cross by George Reardon
made 15 yards. Eddie Kearns then
passed to Al Egan who made 40
yards. The deciding play of the
game came when “Tiger” Woods
faked a line plunge, cleverly passed
to Frank Horda, who in • turn
■hurled the pigskin to Kernsk, the
'latter making the touchdown.

High Debate Record
The Literary Digest in a recent
issue, published an article com-
mending Bates College for its re.
markable debating record. And
BateV record is truly remarkable
but in a relative number of con-
tests Notre Dame has established a
much higher average than has
Bates. Notre Dame has debated
51 time- and has won 44 of the
contests. That is an average of
86.2 per cent. Bates has debated

40 of them, making an average of

Notre Dame’s long debating’his-
tory took on a formal aspect in
1899. The first Notre Dame team
to appeared in intercollegiate circles
was represented by Rev. Mathew
Schumacher, C. S. C., now president
of St. Edward’s College, Austin,
Texas; Sherman Steel, professor of
law in St. Louis University, . and
Attorney. William McInerney, a
resident of South Bend-at the pres-
ent time. The first four contests
in Notre Dame’s debating career
were with Butler College. Since
that time Notre Dame has met
many schools, among them are:
Oberlin, De Pauw, Detroit, Iowa
State, Ohio State, Western Reserve,
Georgetown, Wabash, Drake, Pur-
due, and Colby.	.

THE RUB DOWN
By TOM COMAN
One .of the most notable moves
was the resignation of Bill Roper
. . from the Princeton school, slated to
take effect at the end of the 1924
• season. : There is some possibility
■that Roper will enjoy a fairly good
season next, year with every posi-
tion on his team cared for except'
... the right tackle berth by letter men.
■ Yale will, have to build up a new
team, with the graduation of 23
moleskin .warriors.
Charlie Moran, sensational coach
of the ‘.‘Praying Colonels” at Cen-
tre college; resigned from the “Blue
grass” school to become head coach
at Bucknell. Press reports indicate
that Knute K. Rockne, bf Notre

time fi'om Bucknell.

‘ as a football coach and a baseball

* of the east, and electrified the sport-
; ing world by turning out a phe-

an enrollment. of 300 and hardly
’ • known outside of the county, until
