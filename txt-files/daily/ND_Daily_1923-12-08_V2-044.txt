Owing to circumstances not alto-
gether unforseen, my. activities have
been somewhat circumscribed this
week, but the faithful scouts have
been even more active than usual,
so, if the tobacco supply and the
supply of scandal holds out there
should be no difficulty.

Bverett Kuhl is a most inconsid-
erate creature — for a commerce
student. During Homecoming (this
one is a bit ancient) Everett had
o'ne of the boys in -his room over
night which was, I understand,
against the rules. In the wee small
hours, about eleven o’clock in the
morning, a prefect happened to
wander into Everett’s room and no-
ticed the pair of sleeping beauties
in Ev’s single ‘bed. “If I am run-
ning a hotel this . will cost you
$2.50,” said the prefect. . Everett,
stiff,- and' more or less .sore—his
sleeping partner possessed a goodly
amount of avoirdupois—moved gin-
gerly and answered, “If you’re run-
ning a hotel, for the love of Mike
put another bed in here.”

IRISH TO MEET
GOPHERSTONIGHT
Ten Men Make Trip to Minneapolis;
UndecideiTas to Exact Line-up;
,-Keogan Confident.
Coach Keogan and two complete
teams left South Bend yesterday
afternoon • for Minneapolis where
they will meet the Gophers in a two
game series, tonight and Monday.
The fact that two teams were taken
does not mean that the final choice
of the squad has been made, as very
little has been seen of most of the
meh as yet. Many changes .are ex-
pected later on.
The team that mets Minnesota
will be greatly handica-pped,. due to
the lack of practice, as only four
days of actual work have been spent
in preparation. The greater num-
ber of the men beingi held back on
account of football work. Ned Ma-
honey and Reardon are the only
men who have had the advantage of
earlie practice.
■ Clem Crowe, an all-state man in
high school and individual star of
the. freshman team last year, has
been showing, much class as a for-
ward. Rex Enright and Phil Maho-
ney, veterans of last year’s squad,
are also z promising good results.'
Capt. Gene Mayl and Noble Kizer,
first team , guards last year, will
probably start the game.' The cen-
ter position will be filled by Don-
Miller and Tom Reardon; both letter
men last year, with a possibility that
Adam Walsh may' be switched from
the ’guard" position. Joe Bach of
football fame, and Charlie .Ward
are with the team: as guard and for-
The men who made the trip are:
Forwards—Crowe, Mahoney, En-
right, Ward.	\
Centers—Reardon,. Miller.
Guards—Kizer, Walsh, Mayl.
BADIN DECLARED
INTERHALL CHAMPS
Badin, Brownson, and Sophomore
in Tie; Athletic Board Draws
to Determine Winner.
:The Badin hall :fobtball team,
Interhall - champions. of 1922,. was
awarded the trophy cup of the In-
terhall league at a meeting of the
Interhall Athletic board yesterday
noon. The award was made ■ by
drawing from a hat the names , of
the three halls remaining in . the
title race. ., ' . .	,	. \ •
The .result of the Badin-Sophor
more game Thursday- afternoon
made it impossible to declare an
opponent to meet Brownson, in the
title game, and the board decided to
settle the matter by drawing the
names of the. three halls from a
hat. A member of the board made
the drawing.
. Brownson hall, protested the de-
cision on the grounds that they
were the leading team of the sec-
ond series and therefore entitled to
a- game with Badin, whose percent-
age was: higher than Sophomore.
. With the filing of\the protest, it
is probable'that another m.eeting of
.the board will be called soon to
make a final settlement.
BLUE CIRCLE MEETS.,

room of the.library at 12:30 Thurs-
day. Matt Rothert;. president of

Toledo Club Plans
Formal Dance
Plans for a formal dance to be
given during the holidays were the
main business of the Toledo club
meeting, held Thursday night in the
Journalism room of the library?
The dance, according to Francis
J. O’Boyle, president of the club,
will be held at the Woman’s Club
building in Toledo, the night of
January 2. It is the first of four
dances to be given by the Toledo
club during the year.	-
The affair will be preceded by a
banquet for the .club members.
The committees are:

Gridgraph Next Year
It will be definitely decided at
the next .meeting whether or not
the Student Activities Committee
will own and operate its own grid-
graph next-year. From: the ; five
games played on the grid-graph this
season, the board netted a profit of
$100. This is due to the fact that
the. grid-graph owners demanded a
large guarantee for each exhibition.
The S.. A. C. dance committee
made a report at the meeting Thurs-
day. This committee is largely re-
sponsible for the success of the
football dances. This-committee is
composed: of Norm Smith, chair-

Rev. Hugh O’Donnell , was the
principal speaker* of the meeting.
In. his brief talk Father . O’Donnell
spoke of the past efforts of the tank
squad; aind of the brilliant pros-
pects for the. coming season. He
assured the members of the team
'that the students were back of the
squad more than at any time in the
past. and promised the support of
the Athletic Board. He further as-
sured the men that they would -be
completely equipped and that ef-
forts would be made to raise the
sport to .a major level.at the Uni-
versity.	' ...
The first meeting of the year will
be. held with-the South Bend Y. M.
C. A. at the municipal natatorium
Friday night, December 14. The
South Benders have a well-trained
squad , that has'remained intact for
almost three years.. The meet last
year between the two ,squads was
one of the best of the season;
; The meet will embrace. a varied
program of endurance, speed and
exhibition contests. A 40-yard' dash,
free , style; 100-yard ‘ dash, ' free
style; 40-yard back stroke, and a
40-yard breast stroke will be; among
the various speed races on the card.
A plunge for distance, between the
two teams will be an .added -feature.
An exhibition of - fancy diving will
probably close the meet. ..
. An, attempt is being made to re-
cruit the ' squad from . the . large
number of tank men on the, cam-;
pus. , Many men of swimming abil-
ity have failed to answer .the call
for tank: candidates. ;"An attempt
is being made to raise the standard
of the Notre'Dame swimming team
from a secondary position in Cam-
pus athletics to the place of impor-
tance that it deserves.; Unless the
team is backed by the entire stu-
dent bo^y the attempt will probably
be a: failure^ Those men whose,
ability in the aquatic sport would
be an aid to the team are; requested
to see? either 'the captain or Tom
Goss, swimming instructor, at once.

Students Urged io Greater Support
of Daily; Swift, Gallagher,
and Stanton Talk.
More than 1,330 students at-
tended the convocation in Washing-
ton hall yesterday noon. The prin-
cipal topic’ of discussion was the
DAILY and the support the stu-
dents are to give it.
“The primary purpose bf this
meeting is to discuss our daily news-
paper; to learn whether or not it is
wanted and whether or not it is to
exist.” So said James Swift, chair-
man of the Student Activities Com-
mittee.	,
He urged every student, to sup-
port the DAILY, stating that this
was the critical year of its life.
Plans to secure 100 per cent, sup-
port of the paper, on the part of
the student body and general cam-
pus problems were also taken up.
“Until we have reached the one-
third of the student body who have
not subscribed,” said John Stanton,
business manager of the DAILY,
“we have failed in our.purpose.”
Stanton promised prompt deliv-
ery of papers, to both downtown
and campus subscribers. .	?
Donald Gallagher, president of
the Senior class, praised Gus Desch,
former Notre Dame athlete, for his
part in making the DAILY possible.
“The DAILY,” said Gallagher,
“is existing on a very weak founda-
tion because of the negligence of
the 500 students who have not sub- .
scribed. Until it has the suppdrt of
every student, our daily newspaper;
canndt'hdpe"fbr success.”' . ’ • • .
In a general discussion as to the •
merits of ,the: DAILY; the point of ■
censorship ., by the faculty , was
brought up. It was stated that no
censorship has been made. ' ?
Slips were passed out.by mem-
bers of the Blue Circle in an effort
to get subscriptions. Everyone
present was asked to sign whether
or not he was a subscriber.
' Following this discussion ah open^ ’
forum on general student problems
was held. - ■
.Questions concerning a shelter tb \
be' erected at the end of-, the car
linei and the running of 11:30. and
11:45 cars were discussed. Peti-
tions to smoke in the law building,
to haye late lights and music in
•Brownson and Freshman .halls, and
for a water fountain in the Engin-
eering building, were presented.
No ,definite action was taken bn
these at the meeting. . .
Complaints against the cafeteria
service : were explained and diffi-
culties with which the management
is.faced were pointed out.: A.slight
protest against the quality of JEood
in the refactory was made. ' . .
An extension of the , Christmas:
vacation, the alleged severity of
class cuts in the . Law school, and . .
and .other departments, and; better '
baths on the campus were discussed.
< James Swift, who was in charge
of the meeting/, announced that fu-
'ture convocations were possible, if;
desired by the students. He pointed
out that the matters brought up,
although many were important,
were for the most- part, trivial and
benefiitted only a "particular class.^ '
He interpreted this, tendency favor- ,
ably, concluding that, “there; is lit-
tle at? Notre Dame for the students
to kick about.” •
The meeting adjourned at 12
o’clock. No members bf the faculty .
were invited to attend the meeting.

TO DROP EXAMINA TIONS
Columbia University proposes an innovation which is likely to
strike a responsive chord in undergraduates’ breasts throughout the
land. 'For Columbia, admitting the drawbacks of the annual and semi-
annual examinations, proposes to do away with those seasons'of trial
. and tribulation. That , is a sweeping change, and'one calculated to
daze the conservative. _	.
Apparently, there have been happenings at the New York institu-
tion which have stirred the authorities' to a mood for experimentation.
Maybe the. old-time evils of the system of cramming for examinations
have grown more acute. It is possible that extra-curricular activities
have flourished to a degree involving over-much scrimping of study
through most of the term, with consequent feverish endeavor to cover
1 ground at the eleventh hour and not largely gratifying results to show
for belated industry. There are hints, too, that cheating in examina-
tions has grown to be a serious problem. Altogether, the sentiment has
grown that it would be worth while to make trial of a new method.
Faculty action in favor of the new system has been taken, and the
. students are now being invited to express their views. It is not the
> intention to -make a sweeping change; at‘ once. Examinations will be
continued in some departments. . In others the new method will bp
introduced tentatively. If it scores a success, it will be applied gen-
erally.	,
— It is to be understood, of course, that the proposed new dispensa-
tion does not consist merely in dropping the annuals and semi-arinuals
and permitting the student to progress comfortably and unhindered
from one year to the next. Indeed, the plan has a,very different basis.
There wilT.be stricter marking on the work done in the class-room day
by day, and there will be, of course, the-monthly tests. Plenty of lib-
erty will be allowed in, the way of absence from recitations, but such
. absences will.be at the, student’s risk. Moreover, a higher standard
■ of work will be demanded for a passing mark, and the laggards will be
deprived of the hope of bringing up his standard in a neglected branch
by a lucky hour with an examination paper.
• A good many of the old educational landmarks are falling, but the
ahnualand semi-annual have withstood most attacks.. They have re-
mained : even in the institutions which have markedly relaxed their
requirements, for entrance examinations. But now Columbia is to see
if they cannot be abolished, not only without injury to scholarship but
also with a general improvement in the work of the students. It prom-
ises to be a very interesting, as well as big-scale, venture in education.
. PEAD '
If a man who did not know that a university was located at Notre
Dame were; to be shown the circulation. figures of the Notre Dame
Library, he would naturally assume that the library was located in
some small country town—a rather backward town like a few in Min-
{nesotavor Tennessee. His assumption would be natural for the figures
would show him that on some days ten books are put in circulation by
the Notre Dame Library, and that'on. no day does the circulation ?-eacli
a. figure expected at a university. -	\
This man, of course, would not know that books read in the ref-
erence room are not included in the circulation figures, nor would he
know of the. Law Library, the Science Library, or , the Apostolate Li-,
brary, but even so, he would be justified in his suppositious placement
of the Notre Dame Library. ;
- More books should be read at Notre Dame.
“Life, being very short, and the quiet hours of it so very few, we
ought to waste none of thm.in reading valueless books. . . . ” says
‘ Ruskin. The quiet hours are those at a university. There a student is
expected to read worth while matter, not Worst’s, The Jazzmopolitan,
•	. or the Red, White and Blue Booles, but literature.
-	’ ' Over in the library are many great men waiting to speak to • the
student. Go over today and learn wh'at Romain Rolland/ Rostand,
Shakespeare, Dickens, Stevenson, Barrie, or Poe would say to you.
Go over today, that you may spend tonight, with Cyrano de Berg-
erac, Sentimental Tommy or the Count of Monte Christo.
SYMPATHY
•	? “For which few men'look deep enough.”
.	Sympathy—the consolation for a child,; the symbol of a woman,
. and the apprehension of man. . Our foremost want/in life is a deeper
and wider scope for sympathy. This latent' force 2enables us to see
’ with another’s vision and to appreciate another’s views and instincts.
Thus without losing a particle of our own individuality, we may so
fairly put ourselves in the position of our friend as to feel how natural
it is for him to speak and act as he does.

' While wandering about in the
neighborhood of Music Hall a scout
heard sweet melodies being wafted
(I would say “rafted,” considering
the weather, if .it wasn’t such a hor-
rible pun) on the breeze. He stood
transfixed. “Ah!” he murmured,
“the angels, serenade us.” Where-
upon, the demoniac Sheehan growl-
ed, “Naw, that’s only Petrich and
his horn.”

FOR CANES
To the Editor:
NOTRE DAME DAILY.
There has appeared in recent is-
sues of the NOTRE DAME’ DAILY
considerable comment with regard
to the carrying of canes by seniors
at Notre Dame. • Considering the
anonymous character of the ma-
jority of these communications I
have until now regarded them as
insincere and unworthy of reply.
The latest developments, how-
ever,. indicate that the matter of
senior, canes at Notre Dame has
become the subject of comment in
intercollegiate circles, some of
which comment is not entirely fa-
vorable. Since I feel sure that a
wrong impression has been received
by both your local and foreign cor-
respondents as to the real purpose
of senior canes at Notre Dame, I
request that I be given sdme little
space in the DAILY to explain the
idea underlying the .adoption of
canes by the senior class.
Every college in the United
States which has. developed from a
small one or two-building . school
with a small and compact student
body to a great university with
thousands of students has. experi-
enced the gradual lessening, of dem-
ocratic tendencies among, the stu-
dents as the student body increases
in number. Large numbers of men
graduate with other men who have
been; their classmates for four
years, but whom they do not know
either personally or by name, sim-
ply because the-students of the var-
ious colleges in the university come
into little contact with each other,
and-there^is-no-signjbyj.which-they.
are able' to distinguish their own
classmates from students of other
classes. Perhaps this is not so no-,
ticeable at Notre Dame as .it is at
larger universities, but it is never-
theless a serious problem and a de-
plorable situation.
Realizing this condition, the .No-
tre Dame senior class of this year,
the class of ’24, far from intending
any act of snobbishness toward the
other classes, but rather to foster a
democratic 'spirit among members
of its own class, to cement its class
unity, and to stimulate a fraternal
spirit in its members toward each
other decided that all members of
the senior class should carry canes
on stated occasions as a conspicu-
ous distinguishing mark, the idea
being that, whenever one of the.

boys of ’24 saw. a man with a cane
whom. he did not know, there was
one of his, classmates with whom he'
should get acquainted, immediately
if not sooner. • '
There was total Tack of; any in-
tention to adopt a distinguishing
mark for seniors merely as seniors,
or to give seniors an opportunity to
be .overbearing to under classmen.
The purpose was,'and I. believe the
result has' been, - to - stimulate; de- -
mocracy, among members of the
senior", class without at the same
time impairing the democratic spirit
between the seniors and the under-
classmen. Our purpose has been
misunderstood by some, but I hope
this explains everything. As the
lawyers say, the ■ intention. of-the
parties , must be-given full weight, .
and' now let’s close the cane contro-
versy and pick on something else.

At The Palace
i We had made a solemn resolution
! be startlingly original in our re-
’ . v of this week’s show at the
; Palace, but something went wrong.
: we could have either waxed enthu-'
iastic or bitingly sarcastic had the
hill been slightly better or a little
vnrse* truth, however, compels us
\ saV’ the show is fair. But let’s
eet systematic.
B “Defying Destiny” is the name of
the picture, and the work of Irene
Rich and Monte Blue made it a very
enjoyable entertainment. When the
villain, however, declared on . his
deathbed' that “I crooked Fenton’s
books,” it sounded like something
we had heard before.
Hager and Goodman put on a
clever skit wherein prohibition took
some nasty cracks. Incidentally
this team scored the first “Mammy”
song of the afternoon’s program.
Miss Elizabeth Brice was easily
the hit of the 'show. Possessing
great beauty, and a splendid voice,
she proves herself a real artist of
vaudeville. . z	.
' Benny Barton’s Revue is also
good. It is. featured by pretty
girls, clever dancing, and a band
with the most ungodly trombone
on the stage today. Yes, I know
that’s a big order, - but wait until
ydu hear this trombone.

We saw just enough of “The
Leavenworth Case” to be able to
recommend it as a very fine pic-
ture. . After starting with a mys-
terious midnight murder, the play
grows really exciting until you are
treated to every thrill in the book.

What They Say
NOTRE DAME HIGH
Undoubtedly Yale' and Cornell
arid Illinois and Michigan were ex-
ceptional teams. Notre Dame was an-
other. -Had it not-ben for her de-
feat by. Nebraska it .would be dif-
ficult to find reason for naming any
eleven in the country, as superior to
. the South Bend outfit.' And in-
trinsically this writer does not be-
lieve that the country produced in
the season of !1923, a. more profic-
ient football eleven in all around
play. It seems as though the Indi-
anians took one trip too many when
they went to-Lincoln. Pullman car
< training may be carried too far.
.Selecting football teams in groups
without’ respect to sections no one
probably would object to. some such
classifications as follows:
First group—-Yale, Cornell,- Cali-
fornia, ' Illinois, Michigan,’ Notre
Dame and Syracuse. /■
Second group—Dartmouth, Wash-
’ngton -. and. Jefferson,... Princeton,
•Harvard; • 'Army; ‘Navy, Marquette/
West Virginia; Penn State, Wiscon-
sin, Minnesota, Maryland; Vander-
bilt, Lafayette; Colgate and Penn-
sylvania.. 7

at the home of the “Irish” team
next year. Although Nebraska
supporters would like to see the
Catholic team come here again next
year, it is obviously only fair that
the Huskers journey to the home of
the Indiana eleven, since the last
two contests between these teams
have been played at the home of the
Cornhuskers. Then too, we imag-
ine that Irish fans would like to get
a first-hand view of the team that
has taken the measure of the pride
and joy of their life for the past
two years—Daily Nebraskan.
NOTRE DAME TO THE FORE
Notre Dame with victories over
four intersectional foes, namely:
Princeton, Army, Carnegie Tech
and Georgia Tech, boasts the best

feated three Southern teams, is

truth -is—you touched' a sore spot
and the dogs snapped at you. True
you should not have disturbed the

have better manners.
The seniors do not carry canes
because the seniors do not want to
carry canes. Yes, I anticipate your
question. Senior canes were voted
in because of an unfortunate inci-
dent that occurred at one of the
class meetings. The majority of
the men who voted for canes, did
so, not because they wanted to car-
ry canes, but because of the false
impression that was prevalent that
the lawyers did not want the sen-
iors to carry canes.
So please, Jack, be content to al-
low the cane question to drift ,un-

BADIN TIES SOPHS
IN GRID BATTLE
Both Teams Resort to Open Game;
Finch Is Outstanding Star;
Large Crowd Attends.
The semi-final-game of the Inter-
hall league between the teams of
Badin and Sophomore halls resulted
in a scoreless tie on Cartier field
yesterday afternoon.
With the interhall title at stake,
both teams played the hardest kind
of football, neither side being able
to cross the other’s goal line, and
the final' whistle found the two
teams playing for the breaks in the
semi-darkness.	.
Considering that the Badin hall
eleven was off form, not having
played together for several weeks
and that the aggregation from
Sophomore hall was playing under
a similar condition, the absence of
team work was . party the reason
why neither team was able to score,
although both elevens threatened
. twice. When - the opportunities to-
score came for both ' Badin and
Sophomore, the offense found their
opponents playing desperately to
stem the other’s attack. The larg-
est crowd that has ever attended
an interhall , game this season was
present.

NOTRE DAME BAND
PLAYS FOR RADIO
Radio Concert Given in Pittsburg Is
Lauded; Father Walsh Heard
Concert Over Radio.
“Station W. C. A. E., Pittsburg,
Pa. Notre Dame band broadcast-
ing.”
Those were the words that rang
into the ears of many radio fans,
the evening of the Cai'negie Tech
game. .	‘
When the band played radio fans
knew that Notre Dame not only had
a football team, but also a band, of
which she could well be proud.
Mr. P. M; Land, radio managei' of
the Pittsburg Press, heard the band
and realizing its merit immediately,
invited the players to broadcast
from the powerful station of; the
Press.
That the concert given by the
band was appreciated is shown from
cards that have been received here
at the University. .One of these,
written from Manchester, Ind.,
reads: “Want to compliment you
on your fine concert.” Another
from Bangor, Me., reads: “We en-
joyed the concert rendered by the
Notre Dame University Band.”
Father Walsh also . heard the con-
cert and immediately telegraphed
his congratulations..
