PAUL KENNEDY
IS MADE TRACK
CAPTAIN OF '24
Miler’s Consistent Winning
Brings Unamimous Election
to Desch’s Place
Paul Kennedy, of Templeton,
Ind., junior student in agriculture,
was unanimously elected captain of
the Notre Dame track team of 1924,
today, succeeding August Desch, of
Newark, N. J.
Kennedy, a 4:27 miler, has been
a consistent point winner on the
Notre Dame track team during the
past two years and made a brilliant
showing in cross country, the Irish
marathonians being winners of the
state title.
In the dual meet with Yale this
year Kennedy competed against Mal
Douglas, rated as one of the fastest
. milers in the east, and . the Irish
flash was headed to the tape only by
inches. Running anchor-man on the
medley relay team at the Illinois
relays, Kennedy put up a brilliant
run for second place against a fast
field. Only because his running
shoe was accidentally torn off dur-
ing the course of the event, Ken-
nedy was denied the honor of win-
ning the mile at the western inter-
collegiate meet last week.
Gus Desch, the retiring captain,
closes one of the most ■ brilliant
running careers in intercollegiate
competition. ' Besides breaking the
world’s record in the 440 low hur-
dles at the Penn games three years
ago, Desch was , a member of the
American team " that went to the
-Olympics>t^haHariie.~: The record;
• breaking- hurdler has been handi-
capped several times during- the
last two years by injuries, but he
always came back at the crucial
times with a win. Desch also made
his letter in football.
Dome Dedicated
to Father Walsh
Sophomores and juniors interest-
ed in the publication of 1924’s
Dome met in the library yesterday
noon and dedicated the annual to
Rev. Matthew J. Walsh, president
of Notre Dame.
Father Walsh best typifies the
theme of a united Notre Dame,
Jack Scallan, editor-in-chief, told
the men.
LOOK FOR PROM
IDEAS, MORAN
URGE JUNIORS
Novelties and Means to Fi-
nance Dance Are
Big Problems
The first social event of next
year’s junior class will be a smoker
early in October, John Moran, pres-
ident, announced yesterday.
Plans for the Prom are already
being considered. Moran urges all
coining juniors to be on the lookout
this summer for any ideas regard-
ing novelties that might effectively
be used, as the committees for next
year’s Prom will be chosen from
among those who have shown active
interest .in these . coming, affairs,
^special 'attention will be 'given to
financing this dance, with stress
laid upon the importance of getting
concessions, since the-price of the
tickets must be kept as low as pos-
S1ble. It has not been-definitely de-
cided whether or not the class pro-
duction will be a play.or a circus.
Moran looks for the earnest co-
°Peration of every junior next year,
, SayP bhat much can be accom-:
Pushed in the next few months.
THE JUGGLER’S LAST O. K.
George A- Dever, outgoing editor-in-chief of the Juggler, snapped
at his desk yesterday afternoon as he O. K.’d the list of appointments
for next year’s staff, as submitted by. the Managing Board. This is his
last official act of the year as editor. His graduation in law, this week,
marks the departure of the last of the men, who under Edmondson, suc-
ceeded in publishing the first Juggler, four years ago.
RYAN AND MCCARTHY MADE
EXECUTIVES OF JUGGLER
Rickard Will Be Art Editor Again With Miller in Charge of
Circulation; George Dever, Last of Original Staff, Lauds
Workers As He Leaves Chief’s Chair
In its last official act of the year,
the Managing Board of the Juggler
made nip. of' fhe-outg6ihg-membei?s,
yesterday announced, the complete
list of appointments for next year
as follows:
Dan D. Hickey, editor-in-chief to
succeed George A. Dever; Joseph C.
Ryan, managing editor to succeed
Vincent D. Engels; Frank J. Mc-
Carthy,-business manager ‘to. suc-
ceed Elmer T. Holmberg; Anselm
D. Miller, circulation manager to

The ; position of. advertising man-
ager, held this year by Hickey, will
be discontinued, all advertising to

will be composed of the following
men: Harry A. McGuire, Lawrence

'are appointed-’to^he' art'staff.'*
. Paul A. Rahe and George Sadlier
are appointed to the business staff.
Of the appointments, besides that
of the editor-in-chief, whose selec-
tion was announced in . the DAILY
yesterday, most difficult of all per-
haps, was the choosing of the man-
aging editor. At least three men,
Ryan, McGuire and Cunningham
were seriously considered as de-
serving of the position; Each man’s
merits and abilities, coupled with
their length of service on the Jug-
gler, were thoroughly discussed,
and the managing, board finally
agreed upon Ryan, a junior. He
has been actively connected ■with
the Juggler for the past two years,
this year serving- on the board .of
associate editors in a highly cred-
itable manner. He is a talented
writer and poet,. having also the
very necessary quality of a keen
sense of real humor, so essential

GET OUT YOUR RAGS
This has been a wonderful year in a country of wealth. We at
Notre Dame have shared its prosperity, its ease, its lavish, pleasure.
We have spent, more money on stepping out than our grandfathers
needed to get to America. That’s all right, but—
-There is a debt of thanksgiving, for the: payment of which only
one coin has been prescribed, the cup of cold water. Can we give
that? . Yes. • The Student Activities Committee is putting through
an “old clothes campaign” for the benefit of the naked populations
of Austria and Armenia. The campaign asks of every student
cooperation to the extent of tossing into the corridor beside his
door, on the day appointed, those clothes which he will no longer
wear but which may save another man from death.
Clothes! Nothing seems simpler or easier. But those districts
of a once ■ prosperous Europe which have been ravaged by .war and
revolution are face to face with nakedness and killing cold. Only
the generosity of givers in America and elsewhere has saved thou-
sands from death in winters past. Over one million Christian men
have nothing between themselves and absolute savagery but a single
suit of rags. We may shrug our shoulders over their political help-
lessness. Their plight may possibly be their own fault. But remem-
ber, they are wrapped in swaddling clothes—and by the memory of
Him who spent His first night amongst us dressed just so, and who
called all men brothers, we must not let them perish, when our
• share towards their preservation is so simple.

Daily Makes Its
Last Plea for Coin
The DAILY today makes its last
appeal to delinquent subscribers to
pay up. It asks them to hand their
half dollar to any member of the
staff whose names are printed on
the editorial page before they leave
the University.
More than 400 men are in ar-
rears.
Settlement in full will have a lot
to do with determining whether No-

LOYALTY IN ACTION
All loyal students desire to do something more than merely attend
Notre Dame; they desire to share in some.form of activity that will
bring honor to the University. In many cases, however, their hopes
cannot be realized to any great extent. A large number must be dis-
appointed each year because-circumstances or lack of ability prevent
them from representing the> school in athletic and scholastic competi-
tion with other universities.
Yet there is a way in which every man .may aid the University
that has welcomed and' served him. During the months of vacation,
students may effectively and convincingly display their loyalty to Notre
Dame in a contest that is open to all, the contest of every-day life. By
their actions in their own city, or perhaps in other cities, they may
prove that Notre Dame develops the right kind of citizen.
Many small towns are represented at Notre Dame by a single
student. - In such cases it usually follows that: the University is judged
by the actions of that representative. Words of praise by the student,
however desirable they may he, will make little impression when actions
are not, suited .to. the words..,-	, • j.- ' ? ...
It is unfortunate perhaps, but none the less true, that many ~self^
made men look upon the college boy with suspicion, or even with dis-
dain. It is also true that many people look with greater suspicion upon
the student from a Catholic College. Greater things are expected of
him even though praise is grudgingly given when those expectations
are fulfilled. This.makes the test more severe indeed; but at the same
time it should furnish, the young man with the incentive to see that he
gives no cause for legitimate criticism of himself directly, or of his
university indirectly. Notre Dame men, we believe, will avoid giving
such cause for criticism.
Hi!

* * *
Excuse us, but that would be sort
of a close line?????
* * *
Hooda went down to the station
to get his ticket.
The agent said: “Where to?”
“Don’t you think that’s a little
personal,” said Hooda.
------------ Hooda looks good on
crutches.
* * *
We just got a telegram that
Hooda is feeling better now. He
thinks he’s doomed to die. Last
night he went home, and dropped—
a pencil; it stuck upright in the
floor. Hooda contemplated it. He
looked peculiar. Next morning day
broke as usual (with a crash) and
Hooda suffered a broken eardrum.
This surprised him. He had dinner
with_ an appetite (her name was
Eetmor Freely—a sister to Sukscion
Soop—both lovers of horses—
necks). He spent a pleasant after-
noon taking his enemies' to the li-
brary, where the Museum Pests
were holding tournament -with the
Book Worms. Hooda’s reading was
always-aAittle^wormy..-~r--^^
* * *
That’s the last of the report so
we’ll have to tell you a story, I
suppose..
* * *
Once upon a time there was a
man and he called up his girl and
said, “Is that you?”
“No, you dumb Isaac, its my
grandfather,” she squawked, and
hung up. This pleased him—but
whoa! We just received more re-
ports concerning Hooda.
* * *
His condition is very grave. He
irisists on walking on his hands
backwards with his .ears turned in-
side out. When asked whether or
not he would attend Commencement
exercises he said, “I would, love to
(or three) but I have no sheepskin,
and would galooshes do, do you
think?” We answered that we did,
but didn’t think he did..
Hooda announces that his condi?
tion puzzles him. He says that he
never seems to be hungry after a
meal; he gets drowsy along towards
two in the morning, but that the
feeling seems to leave him when he
gets up at ten. in the morning; he
always breathes heavily: after run-
ning five or six blocks after1 a street
car; he grows thirsty, but after vis-
iting, a fountain or .a Chapin.street
car this seems to leave him. He
says he wishes that it would not
leave him; he says—but enough we
will simply tell you what he said
about his plans next year. He said,
“I’ll take a course in sight seeing,
so I ■will.”
Our Hooda!-
...........* * • * ■ ■. - -:
Life is full of amusement. The
hired girl who is eighteen wishes to
get married. - Her mother says she
has no business getting married
until she . is twenty-five,"—her
father'says she has no business get-
ting married at all. The girl says
if Ma had got married' before she
was twenty-five, she would have got
a better husband than Pa. Pa says
this would have been necessary,—
that only a better man could have
stood.it any longer. Deacon Jones
has proposed a compromise,—that
the girl fall in love with a sailor,
and marry a musical comedy star.
That way she will neither be mar-
ried early or late. Pa and Ma and
the jury are still out.

COMMENCEMENT
Set this to sad music. For its theme is Commencement, and that
is one of the saddest things on earth.
. A college commencement! Two weary .days of promenading, con-
vening, assembling. Two thousand collars will wilt, an equal number
of shirts sticky and hot, and every throat on the campus will be parched.
And at the end, a soul-shaking oration—blood and thunder, fish arid
sand, the threshold of a mighty era, stars in the heavens. .
A sad time, indeed.
. But it shall pass, and the delirious world embrace hundreds of
sweet boy graduates.	-
Now change the music; rapid pulses, reeling—the topsy-turvy
symphony of the wind-whirled earth where all is mad, and, in propor-
tion to its lunacy, gay. It.must be music that a debauched Terpsichore
can delight in, for we are ready to dance, and sway on the bosoms of
the great white clouds. "

J


A CRITICISM
The Notre Dame Daily, which got out its first issue a short time
ago, set forth prominently in that issue a statement of its editorial
policy. On Friday, June 1, a musical criticism appeared on its first
page, a criticism opposed in some points to this well defined policy.
Mistakes of. many kinds must creep into the best edited newspapers,
and to retract or correct all such mistakes is as impossible as it is to
keep them out of the paper in the first place. Such criticism, however,
we wish to disavow and to make apology for.
With the Daily, “distinguished merit, in whatever field of en-
deavor, tradition and authority, shall be accorded due respect.” In
this criticism, we acknowledge that due respect to distinguished merit,
tradition and authority has not been shown. On the contrary, we feel
that marked disrespect, was manifested toward one who deserves and
enjoys the esteem and confidence of all, alike for his personal worth
and his professional: calling, Father Francis Remmcs, who became the
target of this regrettable criticism through his self-sacrificing work as
leader of the University orchestra. ;
• - Fortunately the readers of the Daily realize how ill founded the
criticism was. Those, who have resided at Notre Dame for years and
who know best Father Remines’ achievements in the difficult position of
orchestra leader at Notre Dame, recognize certain points in the criti-
cism as undesirable.. The writer bf the criticism has been officially rep-
rimanded, and the Daily hereby willingly expresses its regret. As the
voice of the whole University, the Daily . bespeaks for itself , and its
writers, however hurried or mistaken or at fault, the generous judg-
. ment of its readers.	;
“The generous view is in the end the true view.”

JUGGLER ART STAFF
Juggler art men, newly appointed, meet in Room 119, Corby, today

From Off Stage
OTHER EDITORS
Fathers have come into fashion
in the movies. “Grumpy” and “The
Village Blacksmith” have done their
bit toward placing the paternal an-
cestors in the limelight and now
comes one Ralph Lewis in “West-
bound Limited” to win your ap-
proval.	.	•
Two elements, outside ofthe.
mere mechanics and the acting, go
to make this picture interesting.
There is_a_fascination about. raiL.
roads for almost everyone, and then,
Engineer Buckley and his family
are just ordinary people—the kind
you meet every day—and- that is,
perhaps, why they are so likeable
on the screen. Claire MacDowell
is well known for her skill in the
portrayal of the middle aged moth-
er, and in Johnnie Harron she has
a son as worthy of mention as her-
self. Ella Hall is the daughter of
the president of the road, and Tay-
lor Graves is the wistful outcast
whom the openhearted Buckleys
take into their home.
The picture is frankly melodrama
but it is good. It is the work of
Emory Johnson, who was respon-
sible for “The Third Alarm” some
months ago, and that is to say that
it. is far above the average run of
pictures. ‘
Callix Miller Will
Marry Miss Sweeney
Callix Miller, art editor of the
1921 Dome, will marry Miss Mary
Sweeney, of . South Bend. The
banns were published for the first
time in South Bend churches Sun-
day. Miller, a South Bend young
man, is now with Freyermuth -and
Maurer, architects ,South Bend.
THE OLD PROFESSOR
(The Daily Kansan)
I am the old professor. My hair
is graying and not as thick as it
used to be. My pen does not glide,
as smoothly as it used to, and some-
times my students complain that
they find it hard to read my marks
on their papers. I love my work
and sometimes I - do funny things’
during1 a spell of adsentmindedness.
Myj3tudents_remember. thoseJffi^
and laugh at me^ I -do not blame
them; I once had professors teach-'
ing me, too.
I like students. I make them
work for me. . They think I do it
to spite them. I do not. I do it
for their own good. The more
work I make them do—-reading in
library, writing papers, handing in
problems—the more work it is for
me. Students do not think of that.
I know; I was a college student
once upon a time. ;
Commencement has come again.
Young men and young women whom
I have taught are going out to take
their place in the world and its
affairs. That part will be a great
one. , It cannot be otherwise. I
look down through the year and the
commencements of the past and
think" of the thousands of young
people whose minds I have had a
hand in training, whose ideals I
had helped to shape and I am
proud of my work. Years after,
they are graduated my students
come back to me and tell me that
they realize what I have done for
them. It warms my heart to have
them do'it; it is my reward;
I may not have accumulated
much money, but I. am rich in
memories and the knowledge of a
life which is bearing fruit in the'
works of others.
I am the old professor.

FROM LIBRARY CLASS REPORT
A Happy Vacation
Many Volumes Now Out of
Print Removed From Li-
\ brary, Says Fr. Foik
“A few days only remain before
another school year comes to a
close,” Rev. Paul J. Foik, C.S.C.,
librarian, said yesterday. “In look-
ing over the records of books in the
Reference Department of the Uni-
versity Library the number of
books that have been removed with-
out authorization is too many to
pass over in silence.
“We appeal to every student’s
sense of honor and the fair name of
Notre Dame that the books listed
and many others that may be in
any student’s possession be returned
immediately to the library and thus
save the University the expense of
repurchasing which in some cases
amounts to some price; in fact,
some of the books are out of print,
and these cannot be replaced except
by a great deal of trouble, in addi-
tion to this in a couple of cases
. the books taken break up sets. If
: the volumes in this case are to be
replaced we cannot buy an odd
. volume but must purchase an entire
'new set.
' These books, all of them, are
somewhere on the campus or in the
: possession of downtown students.
All we ask is their return and noth-
ing more will be said.”

Association is
Suggested
A golf schedule between Notre
Dame and other universities, Chi-
cago, Illinois, Northwestern, Pur-
due, and others, is likely next year,
according to J. Reynolds Medart,
organizer of the tournament of this
and last year. He has received let-
ters from these schools concerning
games next year.
Medart suggests a golf associa-
tion be organized next fall or in
the late winter ,so that this associa-
tion may appoint committees, games
committee, tournament committee,
rules committee, etc., and make
ready to carry on the season on a
large basis. Medart says that a
team representing the University, a
tournament, Interhall games, and
possibly golf links may result from
the proper organization. He wishes
to thank the men who have assisted
in this year’s games.
is our wish to you. We appre-
ciate your eagerness to return

ughly enjoy the summer
months. In the fall when school
begins again, we will be at your
service, striving to continue to
merit your patronage.

FOOTBALL MEN
HEAR ROCKNE
Hard Schedule Ahead, Coach
Warns; Keep in Condition,
He Says
The last football conference be-
fore the opening of the summer
vacation was held yesterday in the
Main Building. Coach Rockne gave
a short talk to the candidates for
next year’s team.
Rockne appealed to the men to
bear in mind the great importance
of the heavy schedule next year pnd
that above all, a priceless honor
would be at stake in the Army and
Princeton games. The East will be
waiting us and the West will be
watching us and the appearance of
the Fighting Irish at the Tourna-
ment of the Roses at the close of
next year, are among the important
elements that hinge on the outcome
of our three eastern invasions.
Furthermore, he laid particular
emphasis on the importance of keep-
ing in good condition during the
summer, advising them to neither
overwork nor lay idle but instead to
indulge in a generous mixture of
work and play.
The fact is already becoming
current that every school on the
ten game schedule is preparing to
wreck the championship hopes of
the Irish. Lombard and Butler, of
the local section, in particular are
pointing to upset the dope sheet,
when they play at the Irish camp
next fall.
The-Notre Dame football sched-
ule :
Sept. 29—Kalamazoo here.
Oct. 6-—Lombard here.
Oct. 13—-West Point at New York
City.
Oct. 20—Princeton at Princeton.
Oct. 27—Georgia Tech here.
Nov. 3—Purdue here (Home-
coming). .	•' ■

burgh.

has won it through his proven abil-
ity, and constant effort.
In signing the list of appoint-
ments, George A. Dever, outgoing
editor-in-chief, in speaking for the
Managing Board said in part:
“The Juggler today stands as the
undisputed leader among the col-
lege comics in the middle west, and
it is acknowledged to be one of the
half dozen leading comics in Amer-
ica. Next year’s staff has the abil-
ity and the opportunity to go even
further, and make the Juggler the
most envied publication coming out
of any University.
“I would suggest that there exist
an even closer organization of the
men on the staff than there was
this past year. Weekly meetings
of all the staffs, at which time ideas
can be exchanged and worked up,
should prove each man’s position
on the staff to be as honored and
as sought for as it really is.”
M’GUIRE IN FINALS
Harry McGuire defeated Dick
Horan in the semi-final round of
the consolation championship of

finals will be played off tomorrow

Ryan and McCarthy Made Juggler
Chiefs
(Continued from page 1)
to the position to which he has been
appointed.
Frank J. McCarthy, the business
manager-elect, has been a member
of the business staff for nearly two
years, winning the appointment to
the staff the second month after
he had matriculated. Through his
efforts, the business men of South
Bend have been made to see and
to take advantage of the advertis-
ing pages of the Juggler. He is a
sophomore in Commerce, and very
popular among the men on the cam-
pus. .
Anselm D. Miller, who has been
appointed circulation manager, un-
derstands not only the business end
of the Juggler, because of his work
on the'business staff during the
past year, but has also the rarely
found ability to draw and to write,
humor. His knowledge of these
three departments places him as the
most logical man - on the staff to
hold this position; his appointment
is well earned. ‘
Vernon E. Rickard, who is reap-
pointed to the position of art editor,
the office which he has so capably
held this year, is well known to
every reader of the Juggler through
his art work in each issue. He is a
clever artist as is further evidenced
by the fact that his drawings have
been reproduced in Judge on sev-
eral occasions.
In announcing the appointments,
the managing board of the Juggler
issued the statement that every
contributor to the Juggler during
the year had been individually con-
sidered, and each man • appointed
