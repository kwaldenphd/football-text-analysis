LECTURE ON NEGRO
PLEASES AUDIENCE
LECTURER IS NOVELIST AND
POET; TELLS OF NEGRO
LIFE IN AMERICA
“The Negro in Story and Song,”
was the. subject of a lecture deliv-
ered by Clement Wood to a small
but appreciative audience in Wash-
ington hall last night.
Mr. Wood, who is a novelist and
poet, has gained much of his suc-
cess through the publication of
works concerning the life and cus-
tom of the American negro. Much
of the knowledge which he pos-
sesses on the subject, was acquired
through 25 years spent in associa-
tion with them. .
. Tells of Negro Humor
In introducing his topic, Mr.
Wood related, several. examples of
negro humor. “A model of shrewd
wisdom” was the term he applied to
the negro, in the course of his dis-
course. Having revealed the origin
> of the first negro dialect verse, he
read several poems of African or-
igin.
• As a verse typical of negro life,
he ’chanted “The Congo,” which was
received with much applause.
“The” Glory Road,” a work written
by Mr. Wood, involved much humor
and was well received.
Has Pleasing Voice.
. In presenting examples of negro
spirituals, minstrels, and modern
songs, Mr. Wood displayed a pleas-
ing voice, which coupled with his
piano accompaniments, • drew much
comment. .	■
As works representing the spirit-
ual type of song, Mr. Wood pre-
^erited'TT“’Wa^
“The Gospel Train,” a pathetic ren-
dition entitled “Hard Times” and a
song which he referred to as typi-
cal of the spiritual number, “Run
. Mary,: Run.” .	• ‘	•
Other numbers which he played
and sang were “Uncle Ned,” by
Stephen Collins Foster, the writer
of “My Old Kentucky Home,” and
“Swanee- River.” " Several modern
। songs were also given by. Mr.
Wood;.
Mr. -Wood terminated his pro-
gram by presenting, several: min-
strel songs, “Chicken Pie” and “Roll
’Em Cotten Bales.” ' '
Drama Club Will
Continue Tryouts
Tryouts for’, the - Drama club’s
new. play, “The Servant; in the
House,” will continue Wednesday
night. \No parts have/been definite-
ly assigned, as yet so that those who
are interested may still try out. No
attempt is being made to. secure
’ professional help. The club had
planned on using local wrimen in
the female - parts,, but as this did
not meet with faculty approval,
the club must fall back on its own
members to carry it through.
Sisters at Infirmary Care for Nearly
A Thousand Students Each Year
When'anyone becomes sick, he
immediately goes to the infirmaryi
Yet, after he is well again, .how
many times' does he thinly of the in-
firmary? He knows nothing of the
Place except that it.has beds and
they are for patients. For a long
Period of years Sister Cecilia has
ruled over the sick students, and
with Sister Stanislava administered
motherly care and advice to the pa-
tients/ Approximately one thousand
students visit the infirmary each
year, but this year there has been
a remarkable decrease in the num-
ber, due, no doubt, to the fact that
there is a new cut system.
If the infirmary is incapable of
handling any case, authorities send
the patients to either’ the isolation
hospital or. St. ■; Joseph’s.. hospital in
Forum Withdraws
From Carnival
At ri very short meeting of the
Notre Dame Forum held last night,
it' was . decided that the , Forum
would withdraw from the S. A. C.
carnival which will be held April 7.
The reason for the withdrawal
is that there are too many mem-
bers of the Forum taking parts in
performances given by other clubs;
to permit the Forum to give a per-
formance. .	,
There will be a regular meeting
of the Forum Friday evening at
7:30. The extemporaneous speeches
to be given by the members of the
club will be taken from- the first
four articles in the Literary Digest
of March 20. The meeting will be
held in the court room of the Lavr
building. :	:	1
SEMINAR HEARS
PROF. DUBOIS
SPEAKS ON METHODS USED TO
T E A C H SOLDIERS; PRO-
NUNCIATION IMPORTANT
Professor Dubois, head of the
French department of the . Central
high school • in South Bend, talked
at the Educational Seminar meet-
ing .last night in the basement of
Sorin ' hall. Father Cunningham
presided at the meeting.
Professor Dubois told of a mod-
ern method of teaching French
that he had used with great suc-
cess in teaching soldiers during the
Woi’ld " War; ' —In '*this ^method,-'let--
ters or groups of letters having a
single sound are designated by
symbols. Pronunciation, he assert-
ed, is the most important phase of
the language to a beginner learn-
ing French, and even as much as
three - quarters of the school’ year
should be spent on this before gram-
mar is taken up. The pupils while;
studying phonetics and pronuncia-
tion,. are’ also given simple words
with which to begin forming a vo-
cabulary. ’ •	.	. •
■ The Seminar . also discussed
whether a .modern foreign, or an
ancient language should be first
taught to one beginning the 'study
of languages.
Juggler Announces
Prize Winners
/Winners. of prizes in the “Movie

gler were announced last night to

ward Keating, copy writing. Con-
tributions for the'“Girls? Number,”
both from the. girls and from cam-
pus contributors, should be in the

South Bend, ^depending upon the
nature of the case. Those suffering;
with pneumonia, or any other seri-
ous affliction which necessitates hot
compresses, night care, or opera-
tions are sent immediately to St.
Joseph’s. This hospital is owned
by St. Mary’s, and sisters of that
order are in charge there. The
isolation hospital confines those
who have contagious diseases, and
it is' located -out of range of the
student-body.	;
Most of the cases handled at the
infirmary are those suffering from
colds, slight fevers, and those tak-
ing rest cures. . It is very rarely
that a serious case is taken care of
at the infirmary. At present, Ward

only student confined at the infirm-:

GLEE CLUB SCORES
HIT AT ST.MARY’S
AUDIENCE IS APPRECIATIVE;
KOCH PROVES POPULAR;
CASASANTA DIRECTS
The Notre Dame Glee club, with
Joseph Casasanta of the Department
of Music directing,’ made its initial
appearance of - the year at St.
Mary’s last Sunday evening before
an exceptionally appreciative audi-
ence. ■
The program was virtually the
same as that which was given at the
Washington hall concert1 about six
weeks before. Iri the absence of
Vernon Rickard,' the club’s tenor
soloist, “Love’s Old. Sweet Song”
was substituted for his number, and
John P. Butler took the solo'part
in “Drink to Me Ohly With Thine
Eyes,” which has hitherto been
sung by Mr. Rickard.
The numbers which were received
with most applause • were “Finiculi/
Finicula,” “Drink to Me Only With
Thine Eyes,” “Junetine,” “Old
King Cole,” and- “Hike, Notre
Dame,” a composition by the con-
ducting director, Mr. Casasanta.
. George Koch scored the popular
success of the evening by his ren-
dition of “Trade Winds,” a new
number on. the program which he
sang with exceptional ability. For
an encore he gave “Roses of Pic-
ardy,” which was greeted even
more enthusiastically than his or-
iginal number.
Mr. Casasanta, the assistant-con-
ductor, who directed Sunday’s con-
cert, is a graduate of the Notre
Dame . Department of Music, and
has received favorable comments
for both, his. compositions and for.
his^wotk. with, the. club. / . . —.

STILL BIDDING FOR
-SERVICES
Renewed reports to the , effect
that Coach Knute Rockne was again
considering offers from the Univer-
sity of Iowa to succeed Howard
Jones as football cbach at that in-
stitution could not be verified last
night. Efforts to reach Rockne to
secure a statement failed as he had „
left town again after a short visit
and was not expected to return un-
til this morning;	i
Hawkeyes Keep Trying
Iowa has been making overtures .
to the varsity football;mentor £ or
the past month, and his trip to
Iowa City for a conference, togeth-
er with persistent reports .from that
place and Chicago to the effect that
Rockne would probably sign a con-
tract for 1925 with the Hawkeyes,
has made the situation take on a
serious aspect.
Coach Rockne, it is pointed'out,
has been prompt to deny reports of
a change; on previous; occasions,
and there have been,many such .re-
ports and offers, but in this in-
stance he has maintained silence.
Students therefore; are ' wondering
whether there isn’t a degree of
truth in newspaper stories predict-?
ing his departure.,..
- Willing to Wait
The situation at;Iowa City, where
no successor to .Jones' has . been
named, is said to’ be that' assistants
to the former coach would handle
the 1924 team; and thatRockne
would be on. hand in 1925, follow-
ing'the expiration of his’ contract at 7 r

A NOTRE DAME UNION
Emerson, once said that the only way to have a friend is to be one.
Such, philosophy is as staunch as ■ Gibraltar, because he realized that
the, essence ;of true friendship was friendliness.	;
. At.Notre Dame there always-has existed that spirit of friendliness;
It took root away back when Father Badin and Father Sorin first began
their associations with the fur-traders and brown-skins in this vicin-
ity; and up until the present day the influence of their example has
grown steadily. -
_ ■	‘Blit;Notre Dame is now Jn a period of transition, and she has been
keeping; pace with the rapid progress of the times. The economic
forces that tend towards commercialism, individuality, and social ad-
vancement are making themselves felt, and are reacting upon those'
forces which^.in the ;past,.haye. been^responsiblejor
of ‘friendship that exists at Notre Dame. Dormitory life and the daily
bumping of. shoulders on the campus is now being replaced by. seeking
amusement in South Bend and. the. stepping on one another’s toes in
the.crowded Hill street cars.' And the result has been a gradual evolu-
tion in the typical Notre Dame man, at a proportionate sacrifice of
that Notre Dame spirit of friendliness.
.As, a means to help put a check on this changing spirit, plans for.
a .Notre .Dame Union Building are now being drawn up, Notre Dame
.‘Council/of the. Knights of Columbus fostering the movement. The
Union, as now visualized in the architect’s mind, would be modeled
closely after those Unions in the larger universities, and it would pro-'
vide :for spacious lounging quarters, billiard and pool-rooms, bowling
•alleys, a swimming pool with locker accommodations, a large dance
ball, and rnnma especially suited/for club gatherings. In short, it
would be. so constructed as to he attractive to 'and utilized by all types
of Notre Dame students, with-the hope of keeping alive on the campus
the traditional Notre Dame spirit. . 'It would:enable the students' to
-obtain, from association With their friends, what Emerson desired to
obtain for his, for he said: ' “I would have them where I can find
them,jBut/I; seldom use them. . ... . I will receive from them not
what they , have, but what .they are. They shall give methat which
properly they .cannot give, but which radiates from them. . . . We will
meet as though we met not, and part as though we parted not.” .
Every organization and individual on the campus. should exert
whatever influence they can to aid, in, the erection of this Union Build-
. ing, supporting the sponsors of the movement when the drive officially
begins, .because, such a building has become a necessity if Notre Dame
is to ;remain,true to her traditions.
At The LaSalle
“Rupert of Hentzau” seems to.
contain about all the stars in the
Hollywood constellation. Among
those answering the roll call are
Elaine Hammerstein, Bert Lytell,
Claire Windsor, Lew. Cody, Bryant
Washburn, Hobart •. Bosworth,
Adolphe Men j ou, Marjorie Daw,
and a host of lesser satellites, too
numerous to mention. '
To stir up a new series of events
subsequent to . “The Prisoner of
Zenda,” Sir Anthony Hope causes
his heroine to lose a; compromising
letter. The terrible stir that fol-
lows costs the lives of several vil-
lains and one. king. It also con-
sumes quite a bit of time. When
the affair.is finally straightened out
all are exhausted, even the queen,
who abdicates the . throne to marry
the man she loves and settle down
to a less strenuous life.
This is very good entertainment.
Though the plot is quite hackneyed
the excellent cast could play “Uncle
Tom’s Cabin” on Broadway and get
away with it.—P. C. M. ■ j
At the Palace
Emmerson, the magician
who
i
opens the Palace bill this week,
certainly deserves a better fate
than to .be placed as the first num-
ber. This remarkable man does
some stunts that would baffle Scot-
land Yard, and his whole act is
highly entertaining. Emmerson is
very good r~	~	"
When Seaman and Conrad stick
to straight comedy they are fairly
good, but' their attempts to sing
made the act rather dull.
Enid Markey has a neat little
skit which, humorously portrays the
inconsistencies of • women. This
act contains a rather high grade of
comedy, pleasant but never boister-
ous.	........
The Klein brothers,, like, the
month of_ March, come in like a
lion and go out like a lamb. For
awhile they are-really funny, but
in the last few moments of their
act they descend .to slapstick. The
number, .however, is above the av-
erage. *
The “Indian Follies,” wherein
genuine redskins do everything
from jazz dancing to singing
“Louisville Lou,” is the closing act.
There are some clever singing and
whistling numbers in the act, which
combine to put'it over rather well;
Owen Moore, Bessie' Love, and
Taylor Holmes appear in“Torment,”
the moving picture. The story car-
ries a message which is not deliv-
ered subtly enough to make you
forget that you are being preached
to. . The picture is interesting, but
decidedly unconvincing.

OUR COLLEGE PINS
' . .The Indiana Daily Student comments in a recent issue" on the sub-
jectof fraternity pins and other badges, of membership in various or-
ganizations of college men. Does a fraternity or class pin imply an
engagement? Does it take the place of the diamond as a sign of
approaching matrimony ?
We think not... Experience as well, as observation has taught us
that a class pin worn on the breast of a fair damsel signifies next to
nothing, unless it be the badge of conquest, something after the custom
of the Indian'hanging the scalp at his belt as a symbol of another
e.nemy conquered. The fthought of matrimony in connection with thp
-donor ;(he7discovers he’s donor.when he tries, to get .it back) of the
issacredness which , is the very, .essence of
a pledge of .this/sort is very little realized.
.A fraternity or a class pin is a sign of membership'in an or-
• -ganization,' and should be strictly restricted to this purpose. If you
can’t* afford a diamond you haven’t any business being engaged. Your
W isn’t'likely to mean very much to. the girl .anyway. If she’s popu-
lar at all she’ll have'two or three just like it, and will be boasting of
the fact; -	'■../.''/	..'./.

What Others Say
Fraternity Pins in the Marriage
Mart
What’s in a fraternity pin? Does
it have the same effect as an en-
gagement ring? Is the glittering
emblem of an organization as bind-
ing as a lonely diamond?
These questions are puzzling the
fickle Dan Cupid of the undergrad-
uate world. They are stirring the
college world to its romantic heart
since fraternity officials at the Uni-
versity of Delaware have ordered
youths who have “put out their
pins” to recall the insignia or an-
nounce their engagements.
If the fancy of the “spoken for”
can be appeased with a fraternity
pin alone, without the expense of
the traditional engagement ring,
it’s to the financial advantage of
the collegiate wife-seeker. With
that, however, the argument for
upholding the custom has no other
grounds; for the promiscuous and
indiscriminate distribution of jew-
eled badges no longer denotes wed-
ding bells—“only affections, that
sorta thing, y’understand,” in the
parlance of a feature writer on
the subject.
One indignant Eastern student
tells of how he removed the em-
blem of his fraternity from a danc-
er in a Pittsburgh cabaret. Some
infatuated lad had bestowed thb
gift in token of his youthful “love”
for the girl. Instances have oc-
curred in which so-called “gold dig-
ging” sorority members have col-
lected numerous fraternity pins and
have used their treasure pile as a
talking point during Rush Week.
Such affairs as these point out
some of the evils that frequently
enter into a fraternity pin engage-;
ment agreement. It is not that the
badge of a man’s organization can!
not suffice to signify his promise
and intention to marry, but it is
that the fraternity pin. occasionally
is abused in this regard. To sbw h
pin in the hope of reaping a bride
involves an awful risk, don’t you
think?—Indiana Daily Student.

The All-interhall basketball teams

There will be three teams se-

The annual assembly

Football Rules committee
York was marked by four radical
changes in the existing football
“Hoyle.” The abolition of mud

used on the kick-off, was one of the
first changes to go by the boards.
The team on the kick-off will have

to “heel the ground,” under the
present rule, to make a groove for
the ball.	.
The kick-off was advanced from
the 40(-yard line to the 50-yard
line and the point after touchdown
will hereafter be tried for from the
three-yard mark instead of the five-
yard mark. A change was also
made in the .rules relative to the
number of “time outs” to be al-
lotted to a team. The new law al-
lows four “time outs” instead of
two as the case was formerly and
states that any “time outs” taken
in excess of four shall be charged
with a-five-yard penalty instead of
two.	•
: A motion made to abolish the
rule prohibiting the flying tackle
on the grounds that the rule was
never observed, was, defeated. To
avoid any more confusion and ar-
gument on the field, timers will
hereafter fire a gun to inform the
referee of the end of the period.
Actual play will stop when the of-
ficial blows his whistle.

TRACKMEN PREPARE FOR DE-
PAUW ENCOUNTER AT
GREENCASTLE
Coach Rockne’s football practice
once7 moi^e got irito”actioir;when the:
spring weather invited the squad of
candidates out into the lot near,
the gym -yesterday afternoon. The
football aspirants ran through sig-
nals for the greater part, of the
session and Rockne gave his kick-
ing squad a workout in the toe de-
partment.- ’ ’	,
One week from Saturday will
find the Irish track team engaging
in their first outdoor competition
of the year when the squad jour-
neys to Greencastle to m?et De-
Pauw. The downstaters have been
training continually since the close
of the indoor season and with first
class performances of the DePauw
team in several of the indoor meets,
the downstate squad expects to
make ’an unusual showing against
the Irish. . . \	. ’
The Notre Dame, track squad
tried out the cinders on Cartier
field for the .first time yesterday
afternoon.
Noble Kizer, captain-elect of the
1924-25 Notre Dame basketball
team, was selected by Fred Young
for guard honors on the mythical
All-Western basketball team. Kizer
has served two years on the Irish
quintet at running guard, and his
work has been of such a sterling
brand that the basketball critics of
the middle west have marked him
as one of the outstanding players
of the year.	'
, Thb unlimited supply of high
grade basketball men in the mid-
dle west for the season just closed
made the work of choosing a truly,
representative team a more, than
ordinary task. Material for every
position on the mythical team was
in abundance, which fact more than
emphasized the success of the 1924
season.
Kizer has for his team-mate
the inimitable Kipke of Michigan,
whose brilliant career in college
athletics comes to a close in June.
Kipke performed in elegant fashion
for Michigan all year and gave a
clever display of basketball! when
the Wolverines appeared in South.
Bend.	'
The center position is awarded
to Ackerman of Kansas, while the
forward berths go to Miner of Ohio
State and Vandivier of Franklin.
The Baptist college star was the ob-
ject bf particular'^tteritio'n'-alT over
the country by discriminating sport
critics, and it was their unanimous
opinion that any honors that ac-
crued to Vandivier for his work on
the Franklin quintet were well de-
served. ..	.

Captain . Billy Sheehan and his
squad of baseball candidates will
probably be able to start outdoor
practice this week if the weather '
continues to improve.
The warm weather -has dried out
Cartier field/ to a great extent.
Coach Keogan stated yesterday that
the complete baseball schedule will
be announced at 9 o’clock;today.’
Walter Johnson, premier pitcher
on the Washington staff, is still one
of the leading hurlers in the ma-
jors, after seventeen years of reg-’
ular mound work.
Johnson reached the zenith of
his glorious career in 1920, when
he pitched a no-hit game against
Boston. The thought that he
might leave the game without reg-
istering a no-hit game caused Wal-
ter no small amount of worry be-
fore he performed the feat against
the Red Sox.	•
The world’s record for long dis-
tance throwing of a baseball was
made in Cincinnati on October 10,
1910, when Sheldon Lejeune, of
the Evansville nine, hurled the ball
426 feet 6% inches. The old rec-
ord was made in Brooklyn in 1872
by John Hatfield, who sent the-
horsehide through the air for a lit-
,tle more than 400. feet.
Stanislaus Zbyszko, the veteran
Pole, will endeavor to regain the
heavyweight wrestling title to-
night' when he tackles “Strangler”
Lewis. .
And the 51-year-old wrestler will
probably defeat Lewis. His dou-
ble-arm lock is as danger as Lewis’
head-lock. The odds are against
Stanislaus, but two of the three
falls-will go to him.	"
The basketball team of Passaic
high, New Jersey, annexed its 141st
victory the other night when the
Jersey basketeers humbled Central
high of Newark, 33 to 30.
Coach Glen Thistlethwaite of
Northwestern, in issuing his first
call for spring football practice,
made a special appeal to all the
men in school who had the least
hope of being able to play football
to turn out for the squad. The
Purple mentor is seeking a drop-
kicker for next year’s team, and
his search is extending to the open
patches around the fraternity
houses-where, during the fall, the
Evanston boys boot the oval.
Jim Thorpe, when with the Car-
lisle Indians, in 1913, established
an all-round championship record
that will endure for many years.
He accumulated 7,476 points.
Harold Osborne, formerly of Illi-
nois and who holds the record in-
door high jump record, had the
best all-round championship record
in 1923. , He garnered 7,022.9
points.	.

; “The Mark of a Man”
- ’ "• Honesty,, decency, chivalry, self-
-respect " and, industry were pro-
nounced “The Marks of a Man” by
President Burton,..of the University
i of Michigan, speaking at a convo-
cation there recently. ..
President Burton’s, enumeration
•. of these, five fundamental qualities
was - prompted by a consideration
of certain things in the life of the
University,which he regards as evil
and ;by. recent'occurrences which
he characterized as being “about
as raw as; anything I have encoun-
tered7 in fifteen years of adminis-
trative appearance.”
;He exhorts the students to a
; sense ’ of their responsibility; to the
University and , described the prev-'
alehce' of ‘ laziness, vulgarity, lack
. of self-restraint and individuality
among students. He made it clear
■that he. welcomes intelligent criti-
cism of university policies and con-
ditions, but he finds most of it “fu-'
tile if not absurd.” He deplored
“the unusual facilities for self-ex-
' pression by certain unrepresenta-
tive minorities.”
President Burton is a great ed-
ucator, and we greatly respect his
opinions. The principles he sets
forth are worthy of the thought of
all.—Daily Nebraskan.

■ UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS—
Students of Illinois university are
taking part in intercollege debating
and now are advocating intramural
debating, because of the benefit
which the students derive from
these meets. A debate between the
College of Engineers and Ags re-
cently was well attended and a con-
siderable amount of interest and
spirit was displayed. In doing this
the college debating .team would
benefit.

sponded to the first call.	=
SPRING PRACTICE AT INDIANA
Fifty-six gridders answered the
initial call for spring football prac-
tice v at Indiana. Coach .“Navy”
Bill Ingram has decided to remain
as football coach at the Hoosier
school,- although he recently re-
ceived several, flattering offers from
other colleges.
Two . bicyclists, alternating with
each other at intervals, rode over
2,454 .miles around Madison Square
Garden, New York, to win the In-
ternational Six-Day Bicycle race.
The winning pair, who rode contin-
uously for six days,. were Maurice
Brocco and Marcel Buysse. Oscare

ends the nuisance forever. It’s hinged
on and can’t get lost. ■
In shaving, too, Williams has just as noticeable im-
provements: Williams'lather is heavier and more closely
woven; It holds the water in against the beard. ’ Result:
quicker softening. Williams lather lubricates—no irri-
tating friction. Last, Williams is decidedly helpful to the
skin. It keeps your face comfortable no matter how
heavy your beard arid how tender your skin. There’s .
. no coloring matter in Williams—it is a natural white,
absolutely pure. Say “Williams Hinge-Cap”toyourdealer.
