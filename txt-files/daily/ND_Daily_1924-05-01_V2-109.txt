Jim Silver’s home run with one
man on base in the fourth inning,
followed‘by a series of timely hits
in the fifth that scored four coun-
ters, proved to be' the undoing of
the highly touted University of
Michigan baseball when the' Wol-
verines lost to the Irish on Cariter
field yesterday afternoon, 6, to 2.,
' “Red” Magevney on the mound
for the Keoganites twirled excel-
lent ball for the nine innings and
was accorded 'unwavering support,
by: his teammates.' He struck out
seven Michigan batters allowed
seven hits ,and walked two men.
Gillingham on the hill for the
visitors alowed Notre Dame seven
hits, five of which were counted
during the fourth and fifth innings.
He struck out three of the Irish
batters and allowed three-to reach
first' on balls. Magevney holding
.perfect command over the invaders
rat all times kept their seven hits
(widely scattered except, for the se-
cond inning in which Michigan
imade' its one and only flutter on
\the score board. Only once after
the fifth inning did the visitors
threaten to score. Blott' reached
third being pushed from behind by
a base on balls and a single. Steger

“Terry” Undefeated
By Huskers Machine
Tipperary Terrence, the mascot
of Notre Dame athletic teams was
vanquished in a combat : with an
automobile Tuesday morning, a
significent thing about the whole
occurrence was that the cai? bore
a Nebraska license.
It seems that Terry was follow-
ing two students who were • taking
a stroll on the Niles road and fell
into the habit of attacking. passing
cars. The boys he was accompany-
ing endeavored to stop .this prac-
tice, but he evaded their watchful-
ness and soon dashed madly at an
approaching car of the species that
is most common on the roads of
this country.
Is Run Over »
He could not be. stopped in his
attempt to imitate the football team
of which he is mascot, probably on
account of the Nebraska license,
and? the wheels passed over '1 the
body of the unfortunate Terry. .

Willoughby and Jack Flynn as they
ran over ,to the. dog. - - He was too
quick for them, and with a yelp he
started in the direction: of Niles.

• NATIONAL BOY WEEK.
' This is “Boy Week” throughout the nation. : In practically every
city of any:size .whatever this week is being, observed in some- manner
. or other. » Essentially,, this moycment (unlike the' “Walk and be ..Heal-
thy Week,” and the numerous' other weeks which, are observed purely
. for. .mercenary feasonsj) is' celebrated to stimulate a greater interest in'.
z . the adults of the country towards providing for the proper, development
y of,our boys—the men of tomorrow;	'	. ,f .
/ ?. , It is a-known fact;^that if the product ,of a great industrial con-
cern, is to compete in the .world t market'with that product of-another ,
equally, prominent concern,-that product miist be so manufactured as;to
disclose its true character in relation to a ('certain quality. If there is a
. flaw in the raw material, or the workmanship is imperfect and the pro-
< duct manages to slip by the careful eye of the inspector-and gets into
i' :the-market; the product when put to a test wilT break down. .	.
.The same, may be. said for the boys of.today who will be the men
■ ■/ .of' tomorrow. • If,‘-Awhile;in their youthful raw-material days their flaws
arc not ironed out by. some competent person who understands the psy-
- - /chology of boys, they will grow up unable, to master .the perplexing
< ■ problems of our economic life. This apparent incapableness .which hin-
; ders.tlie progress of such unfortunate men is deplorable in itself,; but
■ even worse-;than that—the realization of this incompetence often drives
’ men to .despondency and criminal practices.' Of course, a great deal of
, diplomacy must be employed when dealing with boysp because giving
.them too much attention is often move detrimental to them than-neglect-
ing them entirely.,, The “Boy Week” movement has for its purpose the
• ideveloping ,of boys of .all classes ; on tlie'mean'.between, these two ex-
; ' trernes? and should receive the full cooperation of every American

. Cartier field, Saturday afternoon
at 2:30, will entertain for a few
hours the premier track team of the
middle,west.’ The Gillman annexed
the Western conference indoor title
this year for the seventh time and
two weeks ago defeated the strong
California track team, three times
national collegiate track champions.
The Illinois track team will in-
vade Notre Dame bringing with it
one world’s record holder, an
American intercollegiate champion
'and several near champions^ An-
giers in the javelin holds the colle-
giate ’ record with a mark of 203

premier pole vaulter of America,
. holds the World’s indoor record with
a vault of 13 feet. Gene Oberst of
Notre. Dame winner of the field re-
cords for the Kansas and Penn re-
lays will compete with Angiers in
, the shaft throwing event, and with
suitable weather . conditions , pre-
vailing a new local mark in the
javelin is certain to be hung up.’
The track events will leave little
.to. be desired for in the way of
speed, with such men as Barr and
■ Layden of Notre -Dame and Ayers
and Evans of Illinois performing in
the century , and 220-yard dash.
Fessenden in the quarter with Luke
Walsh and- McTiernan of Notre
Dame for competition should regis-

a new field record with a fast
track? The half mile run will call

vania, a student in the College of
Science was re-elected captain of
the Notre Dame -swimming team for
the year of 1925 at a meeting of
the squad last Tuesday. Weibel
who played guard on the Notre
Dame eleven for the past two years
was one of the leading point win-
ners during the past season of the
water sport. Weibel will have
charge of the water sports at the
South Bend Boy Scouts camp dur-
ing the summer vacation. 1
Prospects for the 1925 season
were discussed at the meeting by
Coach Tom Goss and according to
present plans the program for next
year will be more pretentious than
the card for. last season. Spring
practices for the swimmers will be-
gin at once in the “Y” pool in
South- Bend where the candidates
will be able to work with the Y. M.
C. A. flying squadron. All candi-
dates for the team next year are*
urged to begin , practice now as
several vacancies,, will have to be
filled' before the personnel is an-
nounced for the coming season.
The backstroke event will be left
open 'by the graduation ,of Fuitte.
When the Indiana-Kentucky
Olympic -swimming trials open in
Indianapolis for this section next
June, Notre Dame will probably'be

college on the three game tennis
trip. The Irish collegians will meet
Indiana at Bloomington tomorrow
and Wabash at Crawfordville on

known except that each of the
three schools has had the net
game on its athletic program for
several years and that at. Indiana,
the team . is composed - of several
noted net stars from' the lower part
of the state.

ed with the first no-hit, . no-run

result of his brilliant performance
against the Sorin nine Sunday.
Walsh won the contest in seven
innings, 13 to 0.
With the exception of the fourth
inning when the Walsh batters
hammerejl his curves for ten runs,
Deguersy hurled . a nice game for
Sorin, allowing Walsh but seven
hits. Errors accounted for a large
number of the runs scored by
Walsh, seven errors being chalked
for Sorin. The game was the se-
cond victory for Walsh and the
third consecutive loss for the Sori-
nites. >

Every member of the graduating
class of .1924 was mailed a copy'of
the April issue of the Notre Dame
“Alumnus,” the official publication
of the alumni of the University.•
In each copy, editor Al. Ryan en-
closed a note of introduction to the
men soon to be listed among the
alumni. '
This number contains a variety
of interesting articles by inan'y of
the faculty, members. Rev. Charles
. Miltner, C. S. G., dean of the Col-
lege of Arts .and Letters, has the
leading article which explains in
detail the purpose, ideals, and ac-
complishments of the college which
he represents. He also ehibodied
• . in his article the ।recent changes,
that have been made in the curri-
culum -to become effective during
the 1924-1925 term.
. A special feature’ bf Father Mil-
ner’s article ' is a short decriptive
account of the course by each of
the follo'wing department heads:
Rev. William Bolger, C. S. C., the
department of economics and poli-
tics; Prof. J. M\ Cooney,, the de-1
partment of journalism; ,Prof. G.
N. Shuster, the “department of let-
ters; Prof. R. R. MacGregor, the
department of sociology; Prof. W.
k E. Farrell, the department of his-
tory; and Rev. W. A. Carey, the
department of classical languages.
Coach Knute Rockne has an in-
teipsting and instructive. article on
“Football of Today” in which he
* condemns the attacks made upon
the greatest of, all college sports
made by several eastern critics.
’ Taking the ' objection of a famous
■ eastern educator who said: “Foot-
, ball as played today should.be abo-
. lished, as it furnishes absolutely
nothing positive in the development
of the young-, man -in college,”
Rockne ably and' convincingly dis-,
proved every reasonable objection
to modern football. His article al-
so contains a statement regarding
his renewal of his contract with
the University.
An interesting account oL the
Laetare Madel award for T9 24

in the purchase price of one ticket,
which is twenty dollars. Don Gal-
lagher pointed out at the meeting,
that the activities actually cost the
class twenty seven dollars per
couple, but to the successful work
of the Concessions committee under
chairman Walt Moran, enough
money has ben raised to decrease
the prices of the tickets. The sale
of tickets is proceding this week

ties. /	■ ■'
Attention was also called, at 'the

money for their class stationery
and they were requested to settle

upon the principle that constitu-
tional rights should be guaranteed
to all citizens regardless of creed
or of color. On an issue on which
other candidates have pussy-footed,
he has been outspoken in his opin-
ions.”
A stirring plea for' Democracy
was made at the meeting by Dean
Konop of the Law school. “Thez
Democratic party x has been the
party of the under dog,” said Dean
Konop, who was for a number of
years a Congressman from Wiscon-
sin. “It has been the party of
progress. For that reason it de-
serves, and is receiving, the sup-
port of intelligent men and wo-
men. It is for that reason that it
particularly appeals to young men
and women.” ,
The program of entertainment
at the smoker % included boxing
bouts between McGowan and
O’Keffe and between. Dick Smith
and Joe Harmon, music by John
Butler’s orchestra, assisted by De
Paolis at the piano, and “Red”
Hermann in specialty numbers.

will be set aside for Prom guests.
The Jean Goldkette Orchestra of
Detroit will play the Prom proper,
beginning at ten-thirty and contin-
uing until two-thirty Saturday mor-

Saturday the Prom guests will
witness a track meet between the

Denny and his Collegians will fur-
nish the harmony for this affair. As
this dance is open to all-campus •
men it promises to be one of the
largest affairs of the week-end.
Gilbert F, Schaefer; chairman of

stated that ■ evidence of . the pub-
licity being given the Prom in the
