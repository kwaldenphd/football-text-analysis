Large Crowd Attends
Christmas Pow Wow
The only Notre Dame dance in
South Bend during the holidays was
the formal “Pow Wow” held by the
the Pacific Coast club on the even-
ing of December 27, at the College.
Inn. Many Notre Dame men who
were not members of the club, and
several St. Mary’s students at-
tended. .
Professor and Mrs. David. Weir,
and Dr. and Mrs. J. A. Stoeckley
were patrons and patronesses. Ed-
mund Luther and William Furey
sang several popular numbers.
Music was furnished by the Music
Masters. Punch was served.
Plans for another dance, to be
held here in the Easter vacation,
will be started soon, it. was an-
nounced by club officials yesterday.
CUE TOURNEY WILL
END NEXT SUNDAY
Poor and Billiard Champions to Re-
ceive Loving Cup; Checker
Tournament to Start Soon.
The final matches of the pool and
billiard tourney for the champion-
ship of Notre Dame will be played
on Sunday morning after the 8:30
mass.
In the pool tournament Murray
will play the winner of the matches
between Vogel and Pierce, and Wal-
ters and Andrews. . Past perform-
ances give Vogle the edge over his
opponents, and it is expected he
will play Murray. The champion-
ship 7 for. billiards will”be between
Hall and Kaufmann.	•
Two handsome loving cups, one
for each event, will be given to the
champions. These prizes are now
on display at Hullie and Mike’s.
A tournairient to decide the “rec”
room checker champion- will start
some time soon. Those desiring to
enter this tournament should see
the prefect of either Brownson or
Carroll “rec” room.
Glee Club Plans
Winter Informal
The Notre Dame Glee club winter
informal .will be held Friday night,
January 11, at the Elks’ club, ac-
cording to the plans announced last
night by Frank Howland, chairman
of the dance committee. Arrange-
ments were made during vacation
that point to the success of this first
post-vacation affair. Harry Denny’s
Notre Dame orchestra will furnish
the music.
Several novelties have been se-
cured that have not been .seen at
any of the Notre Dame dances this
season. These have not been an-
nounced yet, but the enviable repu-
tation of previous Glee club dances
is sufficient' assurance of a mem-
orable social occasion.
• Tickets for the dance will be
placed , on sale in the halls tonight.
The price of the winter informal is
$1.50, and permission will be grant-
ed the same as to other S.. A. C.
supervised dances.
Engineers Hedr
Sullivan and Smith
Edward S. Sullivan spoke on elec-
tric railways and block signals, and
Jones J. Smith discussed condensers
at a meeting of Notre Dame branch
of the A. I. E. E., held last night
in the. Engineering building.
Mr. Arthur Michels, of the Indi-
ana and Michigan Gas and Electric
Company, was unable to attend the
meeting because of business. ' Mr.
Michels will address the club later
on and is arranging an inspection
trip to the company’s'new plant at
Twin Branch,’ near Mishawaka.
Speakers active in the field of elec-
trical engineering will appear later
in the year.

a famous female impersonator, Ger-
ald O’Connor, arid Wiridrid, who
played in Shakesperian roles.

Banquet Is Planned
by The Scribblers
The Scribblers, at a meeting held
yesterday, formulated plan's for a
banquet that will be held in the
early part of next week. Speeches
will probably be made in great pro-
fusion, if the forecast of several of
the members is correct.
At" this banquet Henry F. Barn-
hart, will give a speech upon “Pil-
fered Perfumes.” the other, main
speaker of the evening will be Ger-
ald Holland, talking on “Diatribing
in Ditches.”
Letters congratulating The Scrib-
blers upon the production of “The
Scribblers’ Book of Notre Dame
Verse” were read at the meeting.
The possibilities for publishing a
second edition of this book are now
being considered, as demands for
another edition have been volum-
inous.
PROF. FENLON TO
SPEAK TO STAFF
Recently Appointed Faculty Advisor
to Daily; Stronger Union Between
Faculty and Students Urged.
Professor Paul Fenlon, recently
appointed faculty adviser to the
DAILY, will address the members
of the'DAILY staff today at noon in
the Journalism room of the library.
Mr. Fenlon was chosen by the Fac-
ulty Publication Board and the
Editor-in-Chief of the DAILY. He
will assume, his new duties immedi-
ately.
In an interview last night, Prof-
fessOr .Fenlon expressed the desire
to promote a stronger, union be-
tween the faculty and the students
in the publication of the DAILY.
A spirit of co-operation, he said, is
essential to. a successful college pa-
per.
When asked what he thought of
th future of the DAILY, Mr. Fen-
lon predicted a successful year. A
great deal, declared Mr. Fenlon, de-
pends upon the support given the
paper.- He pointed out that the
freshmen are giving excellent sup-
port, theii<hall having reached the
100 per cent mark in the subscrip-
tion drive.	'
Professor Fenlon has been teach-
ing at Notre Dame since the fall of
1920. He received his LI. B. de-
gree in 1919 and his M. A. degree in
1922. Professor Fenlon is a mem-
bcr of the University Dance com-
nrhtee and a member of the com-
mittee whose purpose is to compose
an undergraduate manual.
Large Congregation
Hears N. D. Choir
A. pleasing concert was given by
the -four part choir of. Notre Dame,
an organization of 28 students from
Moreau Seminary, Sunday evening
at 7:30 in St. Patrick’s church be-
fore an appreciative audience that
practically filled the entire ’ place.
Miss Elicia Lower and Mrs. J. A.
Mahoney, soloists in the St. Joseph’s
choir, assisted with the program.
Dr. J. Lewis Brown, internation-
ally • famed musician, choir leader,
and coinposer of Chicago, who has
been instructing the seminarians in
the Gregorian chant and harmony
for the last six months, prepared
the program and personally con-
ducted both the concert and the re-
hersals. . The choir is also , under the
constant' training of Rev. Walter
O’Donnell, C. S. C., who assists Dr.
Brown.
S. A. C. DECIDES
TO BUY MACHINE
Cafeteria Committee Appointed
Last Night; University Takes
Action on Complaints.
The Student Activities Commit-
tee decided to purchase a grid-
graph, at a meeting last night. Ac-
cording to officials of the S. A. C.,
several improvements would be
made to the grid-graph. The im-
provement of this board will be
sponsored by the engineers.
Plans for a George Gipp memor-
ial were discussed at this meeting.
It was decided that definite • action
will be-taken this year in regard to
this move.
NOW IN “KID BOOTS”
George Olsen’s orchestra, which
was the guest of 'the' Sophomore
class at the Nebraska “Corn Husk,”
is now playing in “Kid Boots” in
New York. “Kid Boots” is Ziegfeld’s
latest musical comedy, and one of
the hits of the season.
Definite action upon all problems
of student life that arose at the
Student. Convention has been taken
by the University, 'through Rev.
Hugh O’Donnell, prefect of disci-
pline, who recently discussed the -
complaints with the Students’ Ac-
tivities Committee.
In regard to the crowded condi-
tion of the campus cafeteria, espe-
cially. during noon hours and the
congested space for accommodation,
the S. A. C. has appointed a com-
mittee to arrange for a double line
at the cashier’s desk by- providing
two cash registers, in place of the
one at the present -time. The ar-
rangements for this new improve- •
ment will be completed as soon as
possible.	. -	'
Student request for a 11:30 car
from the transfer station on Mich-
igan: and Washington,.to the cam-
pus met with the- official permission
of the University, which will not
oppose-such a move if the street
car company will grant the accom-
modation. A committee of Charles
Molz, Nicholas Smith, and John
Reidy, president of the freshman
class, was appointed to secure the
car at this time every night. A pe-
tition will also be made for two cars
at 12:05 (noon) to relieve the con-
gestion on the cars for the off-cam-
pus students who. return to South
Bend for dinner.
A request by the students who
take classes in the building of the -
Hoynes College of Law, for the
privilege to smoke in the corridors
of the building was refused. Fa-
ther O’Donnell said that the same
rules that, pertain to the other
buildings on the campus must be''
observed by the law students and
that no special permission could be
granted. /	- •
' The request of students of both
Freshman and Brownson Halls for
lights after ten o’clock and the
question of music in Freshman Hall
were, both placed at the discretion
of the respective rectors of these
halls.
Students of, the . Engineering
School asked for proper drinking
water; facilities in the building.
Their request was granted and Fa-
ther O’Donnell promised to see that
the necessary accommodations were
placed in the building at once.
Numerous. reports that the stu-
dents in the Law School were being'
discriminated against by the fac-
ulty insofar as the professors were
charged with considering each tar-
diness a full cut, led to an investi-
gation of this matter. Father
O’Donnell in speaking of .this condi-
tion said that this discrimination of
class absences against the laxv. stu-
dents was entirely unfair, if such
were the case, and that proper
steps would be takeri to. remedy
this in ,the near future.

One reason men give for not do-
ing what they ought to do is that
they are too busy. Neglected cor-
respondence commonly begins with
that' sort of prologue. Being busy
seems to be an occupation with
some people. A certain sage has
observed that “A busy man is never
too busy to tell you how busy he
is.” That, of course, raises the
question as to what one ought to be
busy about. “When duty points in
one direction and pleasure in the
other, our feet incline to the-rosy
path.” This

Did you .ever'stop to thank your guardian angel because you are
' going to a ; school? which bars its agates to girls?	,
- Tf not, do so, immediately, for you are indeed..blessed. You are
free from the cares of week-end engagements (the ring or frat pin
kind), you are immune,.from the:distractions bf a lively bobbed head
12 inches ahead of .you,1 and—for this say an extra Ave—you are riot
in such frequent contact with: women that they become boresome.
Many a merry maiden:has lost her charm for the youth who has had
to be her .class-room companion for 30 hours a week.

is many a lovely -woman-who is the more lovely for being absent. Her
charms are the inore;charming to you for being.irifrequently displayed.
There is a pleasing contrast between the brisk relationship of college
men and girls that see one ariother only; on occasions, and the'horrible
'. “ennui” that so’often exists in these relationships at co-ed schools.
If you have leanings toward study, they will mature with most
promise when not hampered by the problem of'the'-female. If you are
an athlete, you will be a better one here than at a co-ed school. And

It is true, however, that we stu-

hard to get any work'done. That’s
why so many of 1 our opportunities
are able to “steal away on velvet

so quickly, and examinations, due
bills and, perhaps, dad’s letters
take us by surprise. The moralist
would doubtless - add: And that’sJ

- 'COMPLAINTS
During the four years of college, life at Notre Dame one hears
a 'vast number of complaints; but for the most part they, seem-to have'
- little effect-in1 changing the conditions toward which they are; directed.
And thus it sometimes seems strange that such voluminous protests
remain ignored.	-	-	■	,
Perhaps one' explanation lies in< the remarks .of a professor who
recently said: “I have often thought that .the students here at Notre
■Dame have a ' tendency - to1 resent injustices which do not really exist,
or, if existing, ;which are of a trivial or .temporary nature only; and at
' the same time'they are slow, to’ register, a complaint when they do have
a grievance.which* is. both .real and^remediablei”
: If there-is any. truth in. tliis observation it might be brought to
. bear on all cases in which. the;students feel that some injustice exists.
In a word it might be beneficial for the prospective critic to formu-
late some code by. which he may; test 'the soundness of his. own charges
. before indulging in a fruitless attack.-	/
First of all, does • the matter merit serious consideration ? Is
there indeed a. fundamental injustice or an unreasonable restriction?
.For, if the thing is of relativd unimportance, the, plaintiff will not
elicit sufficient interest among others to support him. Of course many
: complaints are uttered; merely J as a relief for indefinite resentment
'without1 any thought of correcting a specific evil. In such cases the
utterance itself' fulfils the purpose and is, therefore,of no further
concern. .	,	,	;	-	•
■Having satisfied one’s self, however; -that there is legitimate
cause for action, the second consideration becomes one of possible
remedies. Perhaps the solution which appears so obvious to one would
result'in injustice being done to others. The rights of the many can-,
not well be restricted to relieve the inconveniehce of the few. And
in the. long run it might even occur .that the change would prove un-
satisfactory to the.very one who sought escape from the first evil.
Lastly,, the’ means employed, to secure a readjustment must be
. . diplomatic lest, personal: offense; be given and unnecessary opposition
be engendered. ; There is a proper time, place and language for worth-
. while recommendations; and the would-be reformer must take cog-
nizance of these things, if. he is to succeed in accomplishing his purpose.
„ It. may be' platitudinous to assert that constructive criticism is
always beneficial'and-always desirable.' But it is important to observe
that trivial and unjust-criticism is not only useless in itself but also
detrimental to the effectiveness of sensible criticism.	'
Uphold your rights by all means but do not belittle those very
rights with “vapid vaporings.” '	-
He is a wise man who knows where Wisdom ends.
Correct this sentence: .“The prof is,good-natured/’ said the fresh-
man, “but'I’R not take advantage of him.” r
Correct: this sentence: I shallinot. go:to the foot-ball game this
afternoon; I- would rather spend ’several hours browsing among the
paintings in the.library. .. V	■	-

Editor, the DAILY:
Were I. a member-of your editor-
ial staff this note would be an edi-
torial with a box around it.
Let us be peaceful. Let us ban-
ish the dogs of war to the cold,
cold kennels where they belong.
Strife is our collegiate bane. Why
should we fight amongst one anoth-
er? Do we not know that youth
is the period of mild reflection up-
on the beauties of nature and the
sweetness of daffodils and pansies?
It is positively awful that such
youngsters as we are should have
disagreements. We should never'
fight for what we think is right.
We should tolerate anything and
everything about us. Give in,
. bretheren, give in! Let not a cross
word cross your peaceful lips.
Let us be mild/ Let us tolerate
any evil we discover around us. Let
us bite our lips a thousand times
before we say one angry word to a
malefactor.. Let us shed thirteen
quarts of the blood from those lips
before we start trouble by being
candid. Children, children—let us
. be mild.
Let us not imitate the Christ that
threw the money-changers out of
the temple lest we hurt someone’s
feelings and naughty words ensue.
Christ, lost his temper that day, as
any good pacifist will tell you. And
anyway, one is taking the chance of
being hurt when one attempts to
throw people out of places. Be-
sides, throwing is vulgar.
Let us be pacifists at any cost.
Youngsters like us should pander
and.-faun the ghost of any person
with .power. . We should guard
against ideas, that bring down upon
us the opposition of others. Ideas
and fights for ideals were only
meant‘for the pariah people of low
caste. And anyway, it isn’t Chris-
tian to take the chance of hurting’
oneself.
. Oh, brother stndents, let us con-
template the pacifism of the little
fishes, and be content to let anyone
• get away with anything. It is SO
easy.

Dear Editor, the DAILY:
Is the Notre Dame basket ball
: team the representative of the Uni-
versity of Notre Dame or of the
fair city of South Bend? If an out-
sider were to get personal with the
: rooters serenely seated in the ini-
• promptu stands (or shall, we call
them bleachers), at the local “Y”;
. and the number, -of young men,
their-s backs bowed from study,
standing in corners, and peering
through the cellar windows at the
west end of the gym, he would con-
clude from the number of Notre
Dame, men' standing, and peering
through the aforesaid cellar: win-
dows,, that the fast, hard-fighting
basket ball team was the court rep-
resentative of the city located on
the south curve of the St. Joe river.
The bee in my. bonnet, and it is
the same bee that has been buzzing
around the South Bend Y. M. C. A.,
and1 stinging many, many Notre
• Dame, men, is that the people of
South Bend’ seem to be given the
preference and also the seats at the
“Y” and the poor Notre Dame man
. bas to be satisfied with a corner or
a cellar window.
Is there not some way we can get
together and solve this problem?
Why, not. arrange to have a reason-
able number of seats reserved?
. Then the.Notre Dame man can see,
; OUR team play, from a sitting pos-
. ture instead of standing up or_peer-
Ing through a cellar window. ,
. W. A. D.-
Editor, NOTRE DAME DAILY:
At a recent student gathering,
Father Walsh, president of the Uni-
versity, said that in his opinion a
college education consisted rof 60
per’ cent associations and 40 per
cent books. • Giving every, phase of
college life due consideration and
realizing, that we are here to study
for life and not for school, Father
Walsh was right.
Father Walsh urged the students
to associate themselves with some
kind bf student activity. And sure-
ly this is good advice for it is in
these extra-curricular activities that
we meet the right kind of men.
Father Walsh also sponsored ath-
letic competitions—he exhorted the
students “to try out for every-
thing.”
It would be a splendid thing for
Notre Dame, as it would for any
university, if practically the entire
student body allied itself with extra-
curricular activities. But after
studying conditions rather scru-
tinizingly, one draws the conclusion!
that there is a discrepancy. Assum-
ing that the student enjoys no more
than reasonable and ordinary diver-
sion and pleasures and keeps up
with his studies, he has no time to
devote to student activities. He
must direct all his energies almost
exclusively toward his graduation.
There is but little scepticism that
this is true. A good illustration is
shown by the library figures. The
number of books taken out by stu-
dents during the past scholastic
year is amazingly small. It.is evi-
dent that students haven’t time to
absorb' a few interesting books,
much less enter student activities.
The problem warrants a solution.
Is it possible that the students car-
ry too many subjects? Would it be
better if the maximum hours of rec-
itations be reduced to, perhaps, 16
hours? This would enable the stu-
dent to utilize some of his time in
educating himself in the way that
Father Walsh- prescribes—more as-
sociations, fewer books.

Tom Lieb To Coach
Hockey Candidates
The winter sport season at .Notre
Dame will be well taken care of this
year with the formation of a hocky
team under' the direction of Tom
Lieb, who. will act in the capacity
of coach and manager. Paul Cast-
ner, one of the greatest hockey
players in the country and who was
the leading factor in. the winning
of the western championship in
1922, will assist Lieb in the work
of developing the team.
Although without the services of
such7 stars as Castner, Lieb, Wil-
cox, Gorman and -Flinn; the pros-
pects for a-strong team this winter
are very promising with the return
to the ice'ga/me of McSorley, Bul-
lard, ' Feltes, Egan, Mouch, and
Crowley, veterans of last season’s
aggregation, around which Tom
Lieb, manager and coach, will be
able to build up a sextet. . A wealth
of experienced material was uncov-
ered among men who have been
members of high school and ama-
teur clubs in their home towns.
From the north country and Can-
ada where the men “think hockey”
are several players whose work in
prep circles bids fair to make them
strong contenders with .the veterans
of last year.
According to the plans now being
formulated, the Irish- hockey rink
will ‘be built on St. Mary’s lake,
with temporary bleachers set up on
the shore to accommodate the large
crowds that are expected to attend
the home matches. In previous
years, the rink was set up on the
campus in front of Badin hall, but
the unstability of the ground foun-
dation- and the unsatisfactory re-
sults that were obtained after work-
ing on the ice for many, hours have
prompted the manager and the di-
rector to place the rink in a more
suitable locatiori.	■ -
Good Schedule Provided
Paul Castner, famous . Notre
Dame football, baseball and hockey
star, will devote part of his time
from business to assist Lieb ’ in
coaching the players, and building
up a formidable team.
Prospects for a schedule, equally
as inviting as the' football card
were disclosed by Lieb at the. meet-
ing of’ the candidates before the
holiday vacation. Some of the lead-
ing universities in the:Big Ten and
one or two fast hockey sextets of
the East will be_ scheduled. A hyo-
game series with Minnesota will be
played at Minneapolis,’ February 1
and 2.
In 1921 the Irish puck artists
completed without, a defeat a heavy
card with some of the best .teams in
the middle west and north and
were declared western champions.
Of the personnel that j composed
that team, Gibbs, Gorman, McSor-
ley, Crowley, Feltes, Wilcox, Flinn,
and Castner, there remains for this
year’s squad, McSorley, Crowley
and Feltes. For the past two years
McSorley, in the forward berth,
has played a stellar role, and with
his clever, accurate stick work has
accounted for many of Notre
Dame’s points. Jimmy Crowley
was imported from the gridiron in
1921 and his work at the goal left
little to be wished for. Norm Fel-
tes broke into the spotlight last
year with a brilliant goal . shot in
the. Michigan game.
Must Develop Men
This year some good forwards
and defense men/ must be devel-
oped. Four of the candidates, in-
cluding Crowley, signified their in-
tention of. working for the goal
tending position. Thus far but two
men have signed up to try for cen-
ter and it is probable that some of
the wing candidates. will be .shifted
to the pivot position.
The candidates were advised by
Castner and Lieb to get all the con-
ditioning work they could wjrile
home on the Christmas holidays.
Practice will begin as soon . as
classes are resumed in January.

the 1924 hockey team:

What They Say
A Princeton professor says; that
the colleges give too much impor-
tance to football. “While the pres-
ent exaggerated importance' is at-
tached to football we are constantly
in danger of an emotional explo-
sion which will put an end to the
games between larger universities,”
he remarks.
If football is to: go, we suggest
that the American colleges arid uni-
versities take! up spelling in • place
of it;
We .spent several years of our
life reading copy on various news-
papers, and during those years we
handled the copy of dozens of young
reporters just out of colleges and
universities...... - ’
• We don’t remember one of them
that < could spell. *.- They were
forced to learn after a year or two
in the newspaper business, but they
learned with difficulty.
The college man who goes into
business doesn’t need to . know how
to spell. • He has. at his elbow: a
stenographer who., took ten weeks
in a commercial school—she started
from scratch, probably, learning to
speak- English at the same time she
learned shorthand and typewriting
—and.she will supply,the spelling
for what he thinks he wants-to say,
throwing in asr; much punctuation
and grammar, as . a business letter
needs,.	. :
Some , of the young reporters we
taught .to. spell, are, now becoming
figures in the literary world.. We
never tried to give them any in-
struction in grammar, because we
don’t know more than the average
( college graduate, but. that is not
Handsome—
and he admits it! Andhe’s
a wise one, too. He
brushes his hair with
. “Vaseline” Hair Tonic. '
No one knows better than
he, the sleek, smart effect
it gives to his head. And
-he also knows that it is
a wonderful hair tonic.

saying that we know much. - The
only college graduate we ever
knew* who knows
anything
a h q u t grammar is Franklin
P. Adams, and we have always In-
tended to ask Frank whether he
learned it in college, or before he
went to college,. or afterward.
Frank is inordinately proud of his
grammar; he knows when to • use
“who” and when to use “whom”
without thinking twice. It is our.
notion that he picked his grammar
up in. spite ■ of his university, either
when the faculty, wasn’t looking, or
after; he had escaped from its in-
fluence. We have always been a lit-
tle envious of Frank’s grammatical
knowledge; at the same time, we
respect it; it is a handy thing to
have lying within reach when t one
sits’down to write.	' :
; It is, perhaps, too much to ask
the American college to teach its
young -to spell. Only a few1 of
them are going in. for any profes-.
sion or -business where they' will
need, to know. The aesthetic rea-
sons, the spiritual and social rea-
sons, -for the existence of the
American college are very simple.
It furnishes young men an oppor-
tunity to meet other young men to
whom, later, they will be able to
sell real estate, bonds, life insur- -
ance policies, automobiles arid, ad-
vertising space. This is its real cul-
tural significance iri the commun-
ity. The minorities, instructors, and
undergraduates, who give something'
else to if and get something else
from it, are negligible numerically,
and in their effect upon the spirit of
the nation.—Don Marquis in The

THE RUB DOWN
By TOM COMAN
To the Editor of The Rubdown:
At the Notre Dame-Michigan
game at the “Y” last. Saturday
night, there were a couple hundred
Notre Dame students unable to gain
admittance to the playing court due
to the lack of seating room in the
“Y” gym. I am calling your atten-
tion to this matter mindful of the
fact that all these men paid for
athletic tickets, at the beginning of
the year and then were unable to
witness the greatest basket ball
classic that will probably be seen
on the home court this year.
The entire situation may be the
fault of the circumstances, and
after 1200 have been packed into
the court, there is not even stand-
ing room left, but I think that in
the interests of the Notre Dame stu-
dents who braved the elements
during one of the coldest nights of
the year to see the team in action
and support them with their pres-
ence, there should be some action
taken in the matter.
A STUDENT ON THE OUTSIDE.
. Notre Dame ran off a pool and
billiard tournament before the
Christmas holidays that aroused
considerable interest . among the
students - who packed the “rec”
rooms each night to watch the cue
artists perform. •
This brings to mind that as one
of the minor sports, the cue is very
good, but Notre Dame also has two
bowling-alleys-that might prove an
incentive to. some of the Irish pin
kings ■ to start a. bowling tourna-
ment. The plan is now being con-
sidered,' but it is often the case
that plans fail for the lack of a
little enthusiasm.
The -winter season at Notre Dame
should be interspersed with more
on the minor sports order than has
usually been the case. Other’ schools
and colleges about the . country
have a heavy sport program in ac-
tion all during the year, in order
to keep their large enrollments in
;good physical trim. The small eri-
rollmenV at Notre’ Dame is no; 'ex-
cuse for the absence.of these sev-
eral sports, and along with the reg-
ular varsity track and basket ball,
hockey and interhall basket ball,
other sporting events as bowling,
pool* billiard tournaments, would
fit in nicely, and prove to be an in-
centive . for the fostering . of the
great Notre Dame spirit.
Due to the lack of indoor playing
space, the chances of promoting an
interhall indoor league during, the
winter are very slim.
Kentucky Club Dance
Features N. D. Song
For about the first time, the Notre
Dame “Victory March” was played
below the Mason-Dixon line, at the
Kentucky club dance which was held
at the Brown hotel in Louisville on
the night'of January 2.' The ball
room was attractively, decorated
with Notre Dame blankets andz a
. large electric “N. D.” was used' for.
the moonlight dances. " ' ' ■ • -

' While we are on the subject of
increasing the sport events at
Notre Dame, we might take a mo-
ment to consider the expansion pro-,
gram at Stanford University, in
order that athletics may be made
more “for the many” instead of
“the few,”. which seqms. to be the
great complaint of the country’s
leading educators.
Stanford has launched a 15-year
athletic program which calls' for the
building of nine gridirons, a quad-
ruple swimming pool, six baseball
diamonds, two soccer fields, 26 ten-
nis courts and an enlarged gym
that will'seat- 3,500. The program
will require an . expenditure ‘of
$270,000.
In talking about the huge profits
made by different universities on
their-, athletic programs last year,
the popular, opinion- among the
leaders of education is that the pro-
fits should be for the development
of the many students "who do riot
ordinarily go in for athletics.
. As well as the education of the
man mentally, another phase of our
civilization that tends to do as
much for human happiness as edu-
cation is the’ betterment of the phys-
ical condition , of the race. There
are branches of athletics for every
man in a school arid Notre Dame has
one of. the best athletic programs in
the .country, w.:	-	/ . •
Knute K. Rockne, Notre Dame’s
wizard coach, is one of the country’s
leading exponents for the physical
jetterment of the American, .stu-
dent.
The freshmen basket ball candi-
dates at New York University en-
countered difficulty last week that
occasionally appears in college
sports. Through the partiality
shown by the coaches for certain
men,-regardless'of their playing
ability, the Frosh basket ball team
was picked almost before the uni-
forms had been issued.
The fifty candidates, who found
that because they lacked. notoriety
in, some/sport. or other,; made 'pub;
0 c certain facts, proving that coaches
favored theii’ friends who had
gained fame while playing baseball
or football, but had never before
worn a basket ball uniform and who
could not play the game.
If there is any place in the world
where favoritism has no room, it is
the athletic world. Fair play is the
keynote of the game and’ orie of the
great lessons that men. learn on the
field to take with them, into the life
after school.

KAZOO FIVE TO
MEET N.D. HERE
Michigan Normal Promises Strong
Opposition; N. D. Quintet in
Good Condition.
The Notre Dame basket ball five
began preparations yesterday after-
noon for the game -with the Kala-
mazoo Normal quintet Thursday
evening.. For several years the
Teachers have boasted of clever
cagemen and each year have been
among the leaders in Michigan bas-
ket ball circles. This year the Cel-
ery City men are practicing hard
for the big clash with the Irish five,
and since the brilliant victory over
Michigan last Saturday night, the
Kazoo quintet has doubled its ef-
forts.
-Only at varying intervals since
the days of.Pete Vaughan.and the
wonder team of cagemen that toured
the country wearing the colors of
Notre Dame, has there been devel-
oped such a brilliant team as the
aggregation that is playing this
year. The sensational triumph over
the -Wolverine’s spectacular five,
gives great promise of the work that
will be done by the 1924 team dur-
ing the remainder of the schedule.
Team work is-developing'to a stage
of perfection and with the speed
and accurate basket shooting of
Coach Kedgan’s proteges, the basket
ball season is assured of a more sue*
cessful run than has been experi-
enced here in several years.
' Mahoney Shows'Class
The general defense work of the
Irish loopmen has been a revelation
to the packed houses that have wit-
messed each game. Particularly no-
ticeable in the Michigan .game was
the jvork of Phil Mahoney, teaming
with the brilliant Clem Crowe at
the forwards. Mahoney rarely tries
for the steel ring but devotes much
of his attention to passing and
breaking up the opposition attack
when under; the. Notre Dame basket.
Numberless, times .during the. Wol-
verine ~gariie7 Mahoney was iristru-
mental in preventing the Michigan
forwards from scoring.
In passing and dribbling, Ma-
honey’s work is hard to beat. He: is
a. two-handed dribbler who gets

away from the usual right hand
run -with the ball, by his proficiency
in the use of his left hand.
Kizer, whose work in Saturday’s
game won him no little praise at
running guard, is another Irish cage-
man of stellar ability. Kizer was
the mainstay of the 1923 quintet
and will be remembered for his sen-
sational last second shots in several
games last year.
Hard Games Ahead
Crowe at forward will have few
equals in the Conference or out and
the speed and cleverness with which
he eluded -the brilliant Kipke in
the Michigan game was a thing of
joy to watch.
Riordan and Mayl are another
pair of Notre Dame’s great defense
men who are experts at basket
shooting.
Coach Keogan and his men will
meet some of the best basket ball
fives in the-middle west before the
season ends. The cagemen from
Franklin college have for years ex-
celled in the court game and the
members of several teams are known
to have played together during their
high school days before entering
Franklin. Notre Dame plays a
horiie and home series with the
Franklin school and the best work
the Irish five are capable of will be
needed in these two games. Creigh-
ton and Indiana constitute another
pair of' of dangerous opponents that
will be met during February.
CLEVELAND CLUB DANCE
Two dances featured the holidays
for the Clevelanders. • One was an
undergraduate dance held on the
evening of December 22 at the
Wade Park/Manor House, and the
other was a formal dance at the
University Club on January 2. The
favors at the formal were mono-
gramed perfumettes. Both of the
affairs were successful from a finan-
cial and social standpoint.
