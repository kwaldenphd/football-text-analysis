Spring registration: for the Com-
merce students will be continued
until noon, Saturday, May 10, it
was announced yesterday by. Prof.
James McCarthy, assistant dean of
the commerce school. All the stu-
'dents in that college are required
to register by that date. Three
will be a charge of $10.00 for reg-
istration on any other date. All
forms should' be left in a box that
is provided for that purpose in the
entrance of the library. The pur-
pose of the registration is to eli-
minate the confusion that prevails
in the /other colleges when each
case must be treated as an indivi-
dual one-and there is a great deal
of bother in looking up a student’s
record. All that work is done in
the summer and classes are fully
equipped with all the necessary
textbooks for the. beginning of
the
new year.

The department of education-of
the National Catholic Welfare Con- *
ference has designated May 11 to
May 17 ' as Catholic Education,
week. More . that 6,500 parochial
schools and 2,000 academies/ com-
ply with the department in the ob-
servances of this week.
That such a week set aside for,/;
observance as Catholic Education
week is . important is evident. The
demand for educated .men in all
ranks at the present time is great.
The demand, must be fulfilled from^ '
the graduating classes of our pres-
ent-day colleges and universities.
Leaders in all classes of life will be
recruited from this yearly army of
graduated students and woman go-
ing^ to be leaders? Catholics should;
be'leaders as well as anybody else.' •
That Catholic education is neces-
sary can; be gleaned from the fol-
lowing figures. Approximately
2,500,000 students are in all the
high schools of the United States
and in 1922 there were only 152,-
000 Catholic ‘ students enrolled in .
Catholic secondary schools, less
than 6.5 per cent of the whole. Ca-
tholics form 18 per. cent of the
whole population and therefore
should, beu450,000 children enrolled,
in Catholic preparatory schools, ac- <
ademies and,-high' schools. vA dir- '
ect appeal .is being ma/ie -to see'
. that the Catholic youth will be,per-
suaded to go to Catholic / schools n’

cordingly, in 1920 “Bliss” was pub-
lished, and with its appearance
came the recognition of her talent.
Praise was by no means general;
there were still the accusations of
hardness, but to offset them there
was genuine praise.
Although “Bliss” is not the most'
recent of her volumes to appear, it
is 'the most valuable since it con-
tains “Prelude,” the most perfect
of her stories, and, in point of time,
the most important. With “Pre-
lude” she proved herself to be ori-
ginal and revolutionary in techni-
que and construction;. the unity of
impression gives a clarity which is
unexcelled. It was after* the ap-
pearance of “Bliss” that fame came
to her, slowly, but from quarters
where praise meant most, 'and
when, a short time later, “The Gar-
chose for the title page of “Bliss”:
“But I tell you, my lord fool,

They’ve taken Celia Cooney to Auburn prison. 1 Celia, the bobbed-
,	■ haired little girl who terrorized New York with her pistol a few months
ago, will have to do a “stretch” of from six to twenty years.
f New Yorkers who shouted for herreapture a short time ago had to
holdback the tears as she was led into the jailer’s room to say goodbye
to-Eddie, her husband, and the mother who hadn’t paid any attention
1 to her for four, years. The story, told in its' completeness from the wit-
ness chair, was a bit different tha.n was expected. .	.
Celia was just a kid whose mother didn’t care. Almost from the day
she, was born, the probation officer reported, she ignored her. She grew
—.zT.^up'-without . az mother’s-.-ideals,-and-finally she went too far and- was
caught? And then Celia’s mother came to her. The mother had made
a mistake, but in that little cell in the Raymond street jail Celia laid
her bobbed-head in her mother’s arms, and the mother’s wrinkled hands
' stroked her child’s hair again. What brought Celia and her mouther to-
gether? The opening gates of Auburn prison? _ Perhaps, but more
•probably the God-made tie between mother and child.
Tomorrow is mothers’ day. Celia is in- Auburn prison. Her
. mother is. in .the little one-room hovel in . ’an, east side’ basement. And

When ’ Katherine Mansfield died
at Fontainebleau /on January 9,
1923, England lost her foremost
shortstory . writer, a woman to
whom as (diverse a trio as Walter
De la Mare, John Galsworthy, and
H. G. Wells paid unstinted tribute.
The opinion is held by many men
of letters — conspicuous among
them is her husband, J. Middleton
Murry—that she was the most ac-
complished literary, artist of ' this
generation.'7' ' ' ' \
During her life time, Katherine
Mansfield was accused, of cruelty
and of: bitternes, and for this rea-

place her work before. the public.

THE KLAN SWEEPS INDIANA.
.‘ Candidates bearing the endorsement o£ the Ku Klux Klan-have
just* won a victory in the Indiana primaries. The republican nominee
for governor is approved by the hooded band, and even one of Notre
Dame’s sons has been beaten by the K. K. K. in a race for prosecuting
attorney of St. Joseph county. -	. .
. From the-tabulation of returns it appears that the Klan members
deserted all party lines to put their candidates'across. They organized
.for a single purpose. But, successful as they have been in the pri-
maries, they cannot hope to win the election. The fair-minded citizen
of the state will now have to d.o. a little deserting of party lines himself,
scratch his ticket from here to there, and keep'the Klansmen out.
'	/ Though the Klan, is strong in the Hoosier state, it is. unlikely that
- it will ever be strong enough to force all anti-klan forces into one poli-

Culver Here Today
After losing to Michigan and
winning over the Detroit city col-
lege, the Notre Dame varsity ten-
nis team'returned yesterday, from
its two.game trip through southern
Michigan to begin preparations for
a match with Culver Academy in
the gym this afternoon. The ca-
dets will journey here for the first
of a home and home series.
Notre Dame lost to the Univer-
sity of Michigan tennis team, 7 to
0, on Wednesday afternoon after
the Irish netmen had. made a gal-
lant fight against superb tennis
playing. The Wolverines - were
supreme in all the matches with the
exception of the Donovan-Rorick
set. Donovan made a desparte bid
for victory over the Meize and Blue
player and had the situation well in
hand until he broke his racquet.
Rorick opened up with a series of
magnificent tennis tactics and won
the next six games.' The'scores for
the match were, 6-4, 8-6.
Brick defeated Lutz, 6-3, 6-4,
while Centlivre lost to Hodgman,
6-4, 6-4. Gonzalez lost to Crane,
6-1, 8-6 ,and Velasco dropped his
sets to Voss, 6-1, 6-3.
In the doubles, Michigan tri-
umph^d again by playing better
tennis. Rorick and Brick won over
Donovan and 'Centlivre, 3-6, 6-2, 6-
2. Hodgman and Crane scored the
next victory, over Gonzalez and Ve-
lasco. \
Notre Dame triumphed over the
Detroit college the following day
in two singles matches. Donovan
defeated Stein, 6-1, 3-6, 6-0.
Centlivre -won over Davis, 8-6,
10-8. , Inclement weather in De-
troit made it necessary to hold the
matches 'indoors aty the 'Genjer’al
Motors building.
The Blue and Gold tennis team
is carded to compete at the con-
ference matches on the University
of.. Chicago_courts, May 22, 23
and 24. , The team will'appear at'
the Indiana state meet at’ Indiana-
polis, May. 29, 30 and 31. The

ches . will includeDonovan, Lutz

N. D. GOLF TOURNEY OPENS
WITH NINETY ENTRANTS
The latest reports given out by
the officers of the Notre Dame
golf club announce that more than
ninety entries have been received
to date. Play started Wednesday
in all four flights, the pairings have
been posted near the postiffice and
at the Municipal links.
The officers of the club, also an-
nounced that the matches are to be
played promptly or forfeited. The
entrants will see the player with
whom they are paired to arrange
the time for their particular match.
Rules will also be posted at the
links . and it is the earnest desire
of .the officers that these regula-
tions be complied with.
The dopesters that compose the
gallerys at all university golf tour-
neys have begun to issue a few
speculations as to the closeness of
the competition in the tournament.
Baseing their observations on past
performances, th{e championship
flight and class A will offer some
very interesting play for the gal-
lery, since the entrants in these two
flights include some of the most
competent golf material in school.
IOWA UNIVERSITY—The law
school seniors recently gave a fare-
well dinner. ' Many speakers were

outdoor track meet which will be
staged on Cartier field this after-
noon will precede by one week, the
varsity’s dual meet with the Mich-
igan Aggies at Lansing and the
yearling’s track encounter with
Western State Normal at Kala-
mazoo. The personnel, of the fresh-
men squad will be determined ac-
cording to the individual showing
of the yearlings this afternoon.
Considering the performance of
the first year men in the indoor
season, the meet this afternon
should be made very interesting in
several events. The yearlings have
a strong contender in the high
jump in' Freye. Charley Piley in
the broad jump should make it
close competition for the. varsity
jumpers, Livergood, Cunningham;
and Brady. Boland the weight star
of the Frosh has been registering
about 38 feet in the shot. put.
Judge in the mile and Hulty in
the half mile will be given an in-
valuable opportunity to compete
with the varsity, runners in these
events in perparation for the Nor-
mal meet next Saturday. Barron
and Wynne in the hurdles will
oppose Johnson and Casey. The
yearlings have several promising
sprint men who will match their,
speed with such varsity fliers, as
Barr, Layden, Walsh,. McTiernan,
Eaton and Hamling. -

URBANA, Ill., May 9.—The
probablity that the outdoor meet
between Illinois and Michigan
tracksters to be staged here,. May
16 will decide the western outdoor
conference title for 1924, has
created great interest in the meet
through the Big Ten circuit. t Both
teams are replete with star per-
formers and in all the dual meets
held since the track season opened
last winter, both teams have been
vying for supremacy.
Illinois has the indoor title to its
credit already and coupled with this
are the dual meet victories over
California, Notre Dame and Iowa.
Michigan has won over Cornell and
Ohio State, and both teams won
honors at. Drake and Penn. Michi-
gan has yet to win a dual meet from
Lllinois, and four times - have

GOLF TEAM LOSES
TO NORTHWESTERN
. GOLFERS DROP FIRST MATCH
TO PURPLE IN CLOSE
J MEET BY A POINT.,
Marking their first appearance in
iriter-collegiate golf competition,
six Notre Dame ,golfers lost their
. first match, to Northwestern hy one
' \ point on the links of the South
Bend country club yesterday after-
noon. The final count stood 11
to 10 in favor of Northwestern.
■ . The closeness of the match was
some. what of a surprise to the
Blue and Gold players, considering
' that the Purple school has "pro-
moted a golf team for the past six
years. ■	' ■
Notre Dame was leading 5 to 4
at the end of the morning'rounds
and were in a fair way to win. But
the afternoon foursomes resuteld in
the visitors piling , up six points
1 against four for Notre Dame, in
the two rounds. The feature of
the morning round was the four-
some composed of Adams and
• ’ Harris of Notre Dame and Alster-
, lund and Larson of Northwestern.
As the play neared the finish /of
the round, the Irish players were
being pressed hand by the Purple
combination. The count' was dormie
three and the Notre Dame men won
the last three holes picking up
four, points for the locals while the
. visitors went' blank.
The afternon foursome composed-
of Bulger... and Foglia . of Notre
Dame . and Heppes and Skaer of
Northwestern was’the deciding ma-
tch for the Purple and the final
. count in this round of 6 to 0 en-
abled the visitors tb claim the vic-
tory by one point.
In the morning round, Notre
- Dame showed its best golf for the
18 holes. Jack Adams/University
golf .'champion played Alsterlund,
the captain of the visitors. .The're-
sult »was one and one. Bulger play-
.,—ing No.-- 2 man-.-o n—the-Irish team'
. n won over Don Heppes, the/ star of
the Purple, the count for the round
being , two and nothing1. G. Ward
teed up with Skaer and won over
him two and one? Corbett played
1 off: . last and, lost to Larson three
and nothing... ....
