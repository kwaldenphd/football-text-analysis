; NES TALKS TODAY
Dr. Gerald L. Wendt, chairman
of the Chicago section of the Amer-
ican Chemical Society, delivered an
. illustrated -lecture on “The Prob-
lems of Petroleum Refining,” be-
- fore members of the organization
and students of the University, last
night in Washington hall. This was
the first joint meeting of the so-
ciety in Indiana, and last night
was the first'half of the program.
The meetings this : morning are in-
eluded in the program printed in
this issue. -	.	1
“The ! gasoline, industry has in-
creased without the aid of chemists
but’ riow their aid is secured in
/ order that^more careful stock of
efficient production may be taken,’.’
■the speaker said. .
“What; are we , going to do when
the production of gasoline stops?
’ The present substitutes are unsat-
isfactory for many reasons; :;
“Vast quantities of petroleum oil
are not available because. of im-
purities and this is orie of the great-
est immediate problems . of the
.chemists. ! ,	'
' : “The. two leading substitutes are
benzene and alcohol. ...
; . Future of Industry.
. “Looking in the future oil shale
is the greatest difficulty. There
are’450 billion tons of oil shale
: available in the state of . Indiana,
each/ton contains about ,10 gallons
J of gasoline.... „There .is, ho.wever,
I’ a prohibitive, cost of transportation
conriected with this material. When
: petroleum , gives out we will have
to . attempt the production of gaso-
line iroha this material.	! ■

From the first strains of the
grand march !until the last glow of
the lights faded the Senior ball, held
last night at-the Palais Royale, was
a spectacular success. More than
180 couples paid tribute by their
evident satisfaction to the careful
and elaborate plans made by the
committee in charge, headed by
Owen E. Desmond of Chicago. The
music by Don Bestor and his Ben-
son orchestra exceeded the expect-
ations caused by an organization
of such riational prominence.
« The beauty of the ball was em-
phasized. in the presentation - of
formal evening bags in gold bro-
cade to the yourig women as favors.
The bags, with-gold cord and tas-
sel, were lined with turquoise blue'
moire and contained a French
leather, card case, lip stick, eye-
brow pencil, and compact.' In the
card case, which was appropriately
lettered, the program for the eve-
ning was found. A white gold com-
bination comb and knife for a
watch. chain was- the man’s favor.:
Dome of Flowers.
The Palais Royale was elaborately
decorated. As the guests ascended
the main stairs they met a huge
canvas depicting Notre Dame from
across • the lake, with its church
spire and golden dome. Palms and
baskets of flowers lined the stairs
and hallways. A color scheme of
blue and gold was used in the ball-,
room. In the center of' the^flobr
a dome of golden calendulas ( and
blue sweet peas rose above, banked
tiers of . ferns. Directly beneath
the dome in an open space a softly
lighted fountain sprayed. One. end
of the ballroom was furnished with
reed furniture. . About the .walls
were hung, the insignia of the uni-
versity and the' numerals of the
class.,. The 'stage on which the or-
chestra played . was, covered .with
banners and streamers of blue and
gold. •	\	‘ .	. . ■ . .

Sam Privitera, of New York, a
resident of Freshman hall and reg-
istered' in' the pre-law course, was
adjudged the winner of the fr ash-
man oratorical contest held at 4
o’clock yesterday afternoon . in
Washington hall. The title of his
theme was /entitled “Why Ditch
Proposed Irijustice?”	.
Richard Quinlan, of Illinois, who
resides in Walsh1 hall, was given
second place in delivering an ora-
tion on “America Must.” George
J. Pellegrin, of Moreau Seminary,
was given third place and William
Coyne of Missouri, living in Brown-
son hall, followed in rank. Bailey
Walsh, of Tennessee, and Marcel-
Jus-Fiehrer; /ofOhio, both- residents
of ~ Soph ombre hall ’• were- Yanked
fifth and sixth respectively. ,
, Privitera is conceded to have
.won first place because of his force-
ful delivery of a theme of-vital im-
portance to the world at the pres-
.ent time.	.,	’
The oratorical contest held yes-
terday consisted of six men picked
from , two groups. Incidentally all,
with the exception of Pellegrin, are
students in the pre-law course.

THE 1924 BALL. .
' Multichromatic forms glimmeringly gliding ,amidst glinting lights
from coruscating chandeliers—?smiling, happy faces—rippling feminine
laughter—chuckling masculine voices—rhythmic orchestral cadences,
( exuberant, mellifluous. ' _	.	.	.
( Something like that—something like that, is the approved form of
describing the joys of a Senior Ball. And only such a lavish form is
appropriate for the expression a senior’s enjoyment of the affair, the
big event in his university social life, and the event among those most
remembered of all experienced.at school.. Generally he spends the days
with the girl, and generally in later days he recalls the .days as some of
the most enthusiastically merry of-his younger life.	,
: The Ball of 1924 was no exception to expectations. It was a
more elaborate affair than usual—perhaps just a bit too elaborate, per-
haps possible of greater concentrated enjoyment of the days were'ma de
less for the affair, the first, perhaps, not included, thus lessening ex-
penses a mite, and decreasing foot aches a mighty. The music of the
orchestra, especially Don Bestor’s and Charlie.Davis,’ was worth en-
. , thusiastic praise. -	,
And now—the ball lives only. in (reminiscence.
' ’	DELIBERATE JUDGMENT.
Despite frequent eccentricities-of mob judgment the general laws
of reason and liberty are rather safe. The eventual sense of men gen-'
erally triumphs, though we may have periods of No-Nothingism, Ku
, ’ Kluxism, apd other radicalism. . .
A .recent instancef was the decision of the United States district
court in Oregon that the law on compulsory school attendance is uncon-
;	- institutional.' Though the efforts of bigotry resulted in the passage of the
- law in that state, and have threatened the passage of similar laws in
other states, the decision of the court was emphatic and almost without
question even by the.supporters of the measure. They will carry the
case to the United States supreme .court but: their efforts seem hopeless,
t .-The district court found the law unconstitutional because of its invasion
of property and occupational rights, and did.not'find it neccessary to
consider the question of religious liberty. Parents} as long as they se-
- cure a reasonable education for their children, it was decided, have a
: ’ superior right to. the state in deciding the character of their children’s
■ ' ' education. Few doubt that the supreme court will do other than endorse
the opinion of the district court and so will settle this bothersome issue
for all time. ■	'	. . _ '
The temporary influence of. the secret organization chiefly responsi-
. ble for the movement in Oregon is also .noticeably’waning. Coincident
- .	with .this decline in power is the rather natural increase being given to
. '	: the Catholic point of view on social questions general. The people are
< ' fundamentally'fair in their judgments, and time alone is needed to
demonstrate this..	- .	’	> . .	' ’	\

have read the slender volume that
represents the best work of Mangan
whose “speech was full of sudden
witticisms, shy fooling that drew
no blood.” It has been off the press
too long, the cover is dusty, the
type is cold, but it is as warm and
graceful as ever. Some strange
fate has overlooked the woi-k of
Mangan, just as it overlooked the
work of Miss Guiney, who, if she is
widely known today, is known
through the kind offices ,of Chris-
topher Morley who very sagely in-
cluded her “Precept of Peace” in
his collection of “Modern, Essays.”
The Tennyson biography of Miss
Guiney, while it is not everything
that a biography should be, will do
much to. renew her popularity;
and as for Mangari, so long as there
is a copy of “Dark Rosaleen” ex-
tant, he will be'the most glorious
figure of nineteenth century poe-
try- ''	-^J. D. B.

UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA
—The 1924 Mock Political conven-
tion has formulated a tentative
platform, subject to debate. The
platform provides for all the differ-
ing political views, touching on the
foreign policy, prohibition, immi-

cultural relief, the supreme court,
transportation, the soldiers bonus,
and the cancellation of war debts.
It is hoped that the convention will
build state sentiment.' The policies
favored are mainly progressive.
YALE UNIVERSITY—Author-
ities are contemplating on banish-
ing coaches from the sidelines
during games, in order that, con-
tests may be more battle of brain

themselves, rather than a battle of
wits between highly specialized and
high salaried coaches.

Irish Basebailers
Meet Iowa Today
Coach Keogan’s Notre Dame base-
• ball team left at 7 o’clock last night
for Iowa City where the Irish dia-
mond dusters will meet the-Iowa
university nine in a return engage-
ment.
The Blue and Gold squad travels
west to wipe out the defeat suffered
at the hands of the Hawkeye aggre-
gation last Tuesday afternoon.
Notre Dame will have an even
. break and then some to win over
the Io wans. ..The westerner’s hard
hitting ball club will stand a good
chance of tasting defeat if Keogan
drafts Magevney for mound duty.
The Irish mentor did. not name his
. pitching choice when he left last
night but he carried three pitchers,
Magevney, Stange and McGrath.
Notre Dame, however, is just as
anxious to win over Wisconsin next
Monday as they are to subdue the
Barrymen. Another factor that will
play an important part in the Iowa
engagement will be the work of the
infield. In the Minnesota game,
Magevney might have had a shut
. out over the .Gophers had it not
been for some loose fielding that
enabled the visitors to push five runs
across. '
, The Badgers appearing on Cart-
. ier field next Monday while not re-
garded as a consistently dangerous
ball club will be just as strong as
1 any conference nine the Irish have
' met yet. The ‘ Cardinals lost, to
Purdue by a heavy score after nos-
ing Illinois out of the conference
. lead. When Wisconsin played Pur-?
due earlier in the season, the Bad-
gers were forced to go twelve in-
t i nings to beat them 10 to 9, and
> the victory was affected by the use
of two pitchers.	.	'
' ; The following men made the Iowa
trip: Silver, - Smith, Stange, Mc-
' ' Grath, Magevney, Nolan; Prender-
. grast, Sheehan, Pearson,' Vergara,
— ''Crowley,—Dunne’ and"QuinIan.

WALSH KEEPS LEADERSHIP
.WITH LATE RALLY, 8 TO 7
Scoring seven runs in the last
two innings of a seven inning game,
Walsh overcame a six run lead and
defeated the Day. Dodgers 8 to 7
on' the varsity diamond yesterday
afternoon. The sensational rally in
the • closing, chapters of the ipter-
hall struggle saved Father Hagger-
ty’s charges from having their
string of victories broken by the
Off-campus aggregation.
Nyikos on the hill for the town
men displayed unusual effectiveness
and had the Walshites puzzled for
five innings after allowing one run
on one hit in the opening frame.
Antoine hurling for Walsh pitched
an excellent game with the excep-
tion of the fourth and fifth inning
when the Dodgers found him for
seven runs. A home run by Sul-
livan, the bambino of the Walshites,
with two men on in the sixth started
the fireworks for Walsh. The fifth,
was the banner inning for the Day
men, -three hits and an error con-
tributing largely to the score. .
