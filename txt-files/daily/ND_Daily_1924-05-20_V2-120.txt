BOTH FLANNERY AND M’GUIRE
CONGRATULATE PAPER ‘
ON ANNIVERSARY
One year ago today, a new cam-
pus publication was born to the
University of Notre Dame.
It was “The Notre Dame Daily,”
the product of a group of men who
had the interest of-the’ University
. at heart' and who were eager to .
present Notre Dame news to' the
students and to others interested
in it. Through the efforts of such
men as Kniite K. Rockne',’ Rev.
Thomas. A. Lahey, Prof. John M.i
; Cooney and Prof. George N; Shu-
ster and August Desch, “The Daily”'
became a reality.. Incidentally the;
S. A.' C., represented by John -Cav-‘
anaugh, . was : also an important1'
factor in securing its publication.
Flannery First Editor.
? ^Under the direction of Harry W.
"Flannery, editor-in-chief, and James
F. Hayes, business manager, ‘.‘The
Daily” made its first appearance on
the campus May 20, 1923. Pub-
lication of the student newsp'aper
was suspended in. June, for during
its trial its. success was practically
assured/ ; • '	", ./;..'
In September, 1923, Harry Flan-
J nery again resumed the task . of
1 putting out Notre' Dame’s? campus
publication, assisted ’ by' . James
I Hayes,' business manager. . Head-
j quarters for the paper were estab-
| lished in the rear of Corby hall.
Under the management of these'.two
j men,..The Daily became a’publica-
|tion of recognized'merit.' The ed-
-uUtbrials?. were_r.:its^ f e^^^^
! ing‘much comment^By degrees the
staff reached a/state of efficiency,
■despite ■ the;-frequent reverses en-
countered'during the pioneer stage.
I Paper Changes Hands.
j In the latter part of November,
j .several members of the staff, in-
i eluding the editor-in-chief and the
| business manager, ;were . forced
: | through lack of time for study, to
j surrender the campus inewspaper. to
J the hands of Harry A. McGuire and
I' John N. Stanton; editor-in-chief,and
business . manager, respectively.
Under the direction of these.' men
several important changes were
madq. At this time the office of
The Daily was moved to‘the base-
ment-’of Walsh hall, its' present lo-
cation. Changes were again made
in the staff in March when McGuire
Iwas compelled , to resign'- because
of .ill. health..-. Stanton retained-his
position as business ‘manager/ ";
Funk Becomes Editor.
James Hayes
Harry Flannery
These two men, *Harry Flannery,: were largely responsible for the
'the first* editor-in-chief,-and James' early..success of The Daily,- which
Hayes,” the first business manager/ celebrates its anniversary today.

•	THE; FIRST YEAR.	" ? :
The Daily- is today one year old.' ‘
On a Sunday morning last May the -first issue of the Daily, the;
Senior ball issue, made its appearance on the campus. Since then it has;
- been guided along a perilous course to what now promises to be a sue-!
z cessful destination.	• ,	'
-v! 'The men who have had its interests in their charge have done their
• level best to make it a representative.paper.", It has riot been,easy, yet:
if the Daily has succeeded in becoming a part of Notre Dame.they will
- all will feel well repaid.	;	(
. The Daily has tried to “shoot square” with everybody—that is its!
. policy. ‘ On this day, the anniversary of its beginning, -it;.expressgs Jt_s:
appreciation for all who ,have aided it through the uncertain days. And■
So that its readers will not forget its objective, it asks.leave-to repeat.
/ the “policy platform” as drafted by its first; editor:	;
“The Notre Dame.Daily exists for the student body and has,for:
its sole purpose; the promotion of the welfare of ! Notre’ Dame-;—institu-
tion, student and faculty; It aims to represent the University, to mirror
its life, to foster and protect its traditions,, and to preserve a spirit of;
, ’ loyalty among the students. It shall make a sincere and courageous 'ef-;
fort-to print the truth, thoroughly, accurately, impartially, and chari-
tably. It shall endeavor to be clean, to be cheerful, to respect the rights
of individuals, of the student body, of the University, of civic and na;
. 1 tional units.	‘	’	(
“The ideals of Notre Dame are those of the Daily. Christian cul-:
ture and the development of character in students, even at the: expensb
of the development of the technician, these are its. ideals./ The Daily:
- - itself shall always live up to the true spirit of . Notre Dame, and shall
insist that all men of Notre Dame likewise live up td.this spirit. Funda-
mental democracy in campus Jife,. fraternity and true Christian fellow-
ship shall be insisted upon. Distinguished merit, in whatever field । of-
endeavor? tradition, and authority, -shall be accorded due respect.' A:
firm belief in the worth of all men of Notre Dame, their -idealism and!
loyalty/shalbbe upheld, and the co-operation and mutual trust of stu-!
dents;and University preserved.	. ;	'.	' i
,	' “Progress shall be;the watchword. Steady improvement in all:
academic and campus activities are the aims. Support and attention;
shall be given in the Daily news columns to all student activities,
■ - slighting or favoring none. a. - ■	- ; . :	1
< , “The Daily will endeavor to be one with the University and with
its students. It shall endeavor to keep-to the course it has here laid out
for itself, and. shall, always bear in mind the glory and honor of our

What Others Say
— Who, Makes the College Name. ..
Cleanliness is next to Godliness,
spiritually and riiorally, mentally
and physically. Such doctrine per-
tains to the. individual and’ to. the
group which is composed of individ-
uals. Although the standards set
by . the college -authorities are in
general terms and' usually spoken
of collectively, yet they aim at the
individual and his characteristics
and habits.. Like a ball of .yarn,;
being dropped, can in one second:
unwind what has- taken • perhaps;
hours to wind; so one heedless per-j
son cari undo the good name Of an
institution, which has takep years
to build with lone unsocial action-
in an instant. ■	.
It is evident .that <some few do:
not realize the responsibility !thaV
is placed^ upon them; in ; order: to
keep virtue at' her best upon the!
cariipus. You . may think that! you
are insigriificant arid ■ ’ that • what
you may, do will not have, any bear-
ing1 upon - the. majority of'students
at the institution. What you do IS
going- to affect/the?good name of
the college if- it be contrary to the
■present-code--of-j.>living^~-Seriou31yr
corisider the outcome-before you act
and. place your ^Fostering Mother
above your own ’ personal satisfac-'

Nine Old Classes
to Hold Reunions
Commencement activities of 1924
will mark the reunions of nine
classes: the classes of ’79, ’84, ’89,
’94, *99, ’04, ’09, ’14 and ’.19.
The reunion chairman of these
respective classes have made .all the
plans and have notified the members
of the classes in regard to these
plans. The class of ’14, of which
Knute K. Rockrie, athletic director
and football coach, is a. member,
has made unusual plans for the re-
union. .
The class of ’04, of which Revs.
Joseph Burke, director of studies
Thomas Irving, vice-president of
the University, George MacNauiara,
and Erriest Davis. are members is
holding its twentieth . anniversary
reunion. Other prominent members
of this class are Hon. Robert “Bob”
Procter of Elkhart and Byron V.
Kanaley of Chicago. The ’04 class
will probably be the largest re-
united class on the “campus at that
date.
The Chicago representation will
possibly be the most representative
of recent years.

It will be impossible for the St.
Mary’s Greek play, which /will be

RAIN HOLDS UP INTER-
HALL, BASEBALL CARD
With the annual State track meet
which is scheduled .to be held ,at
Notre Dame on Cartier field this
year, but. five days away, track
teams in all the colleges of Indiana
that have entered the Hoosier interr
collegiate classic are undergoing an’
intense training preparatory to the
'high class field that. will. face the
starters. gun next Saturday after-
noon.	;	..	.
, The state meet for Indiana col-
leges run off at Richmond last Sat-,
urday gave, further indication that
the advance dope slating Butler
college -to be the challenger of
'Notre Dame/at the state, classic
this year was correct. Butler is
the power in the track circles" of
Indiana, and coupled with' Purdue
and Indiana, the downstaters are
: going to make it an interesting
afternoon for Coach Rockne’s track-,
t.sters. -The conf erence. schools can
: be figured on to press the compet-
Jtion in several events, notably the
mile and half mile. Nay of Indiana
. is stepping the mile in a little better
than 4:35. Spradling of Purdue
'won the ’ 880-yard run against
Northwestern in 1:57. The Boiler-
maker flash is' also a quarter miler,
taking the oval in 0:51 5-10. The,
mile event .will call out some excep--
tionally fast men when Kennedy of:
Notre Dame, Doolittle of Butler and
Robins of Wabash take the mark.
The Little, Giant star is an all-around
distance • man, competing at differ-
ent dual meets throughout the state
in the half mile, mile and two mile.
.The other schools will not be able
? to place a man .in this class with
.exception of Nay of Indiana who
will fight for a place.-; . . _	.
.; Doolittle of > Wabash holds the
state title in the two mile and from
all indication^. there is little danger
!. that he will lose it. Wendland of
; Nore ’Dame should be' his /closest"
competitor, the latter turning in a
9:41 victory on the- indoor course
^D6olittle ~holds~ the''state'rmark^at1
9:45. , The conference schools and
the other colleges -will not be able
to enter a two miler doing better
than ten minutes flat. Robbins)of.
. .Wabash, however, may do the un-
expected in the. distance! run.

DICK FALVEY WINS ON
MOUND FOR NAPPANEE
KILEY CALLS LOYOLA
MEN FOR GRID, WORK
Victories over Iowa and Minnes-
ota, two of the leading western con-
ference nines, will be sought by
the varsity baseball nine today and
tomorrow, both games being sched-
uled to start at 3:45 o’clock.
. Notre.Dame, on the face of past
performances, holds, a slight edge
over both teams, the result of vic-
tories over Illinois, Michigan,
Northwestern and Indiana. It is
an advantage on paper only, how-
ever,* and may easily be dispelled.
' With Iowa today will be a quar-
tet of heavy sluggers, including
Poepsel, King, Scantlebury and
NAPANEE, Ind., May 19.—Dick
Falvey turned in a 14 to 8 victory
for the' local semi-pro team here
Sunday, having little difficulty in
stopping the Garrett team. He held
the visitors to one run for seven
innings, and then eased up as his
mates had given him an advantage
of twelve runs. Falvey pitched for
Notre Dame last season. -
• CHICAGO, Hi./ May 19.—Roger
Kiley, former Notre Dame star who

will have many veterans back and
the outlook for next year, is good. ?
TENNIS RESULTS

season' promise
to give Irish
pitchers trouble. •
Coach Keogan’s team will not be
outclassed in this department, how-
ever, for the entire squad has been
clouting during the last few games.
This is a most encouraging condi-
tion, inasmuch as the, strain on the
pitching staff will be unusually
heavy during the last half of the
schedule, now entered into.
' Tomorrow’s game with. Minnes-
ota is attracting more than ordin-
ary, attention, as it is the first time
in recent years that a Minnesota
team has appeared at Notre Dame.
The Goph'ers also possess a' hard-
hitting crew, Foote, Ascher and
Eklund, benig the leaders, , while
Guzy, the hitting pitcher, rounds
out .the quartet.;
Results of the Notre Dame-Loy--
ola tennis match are as follows:
Singles—Donovan, N., beat Si-,
munich, L., 6-2, 6-1. Centlivre, N.,

/ DAILY ONE YEAR OLD
(Continued from page one.)
“In the name of the past manage-
nient\of The Daily, I repeat my
congratulations for the present and
' express hopes for the. future.”
From Harry-A. McGuire, second
editor-in-chief ; of The Daily, who
helped to further the work of his
colleagues and to • improve upon
their work comes the following
greeting:
7 7So7the infant is a year old!
Surely the staff of men which has
worked long, hours on each issue
of they paper., arid fought for the
very existence of the little sheet,
deserves the-heartiest-'of; congratu-
lations., These I earnestly extend
to The Daily men. It is a matter,
of credit to every reporter, every
' night editor, and to the present ed-
itor-in-chief, that a year so hazard-
ous, so beset with pitfalls tricky and
intriguing, /has been successfully
, passed. "
“I fervently hope that The Daily
may continue its existence and its
improvements. ..It has a mission to
perform at Notre Dame. And with
the increasing strength of body inay
. there come an ever increasing
strength of soul. My word of cheer
is ‘Fight on, and ever, upward!’ ”

RECORDS MAY FALL
(Continued from page three.)
The state marks in the hurdles
also .look safe since the Hoosier
timber toppers have not been com-
ing very close to 0:15 in the tall
barriers and 0:24.2 in the low
hurdles. Desch of Notre Dame set
the lbw barrier mark in 1922 and
the Hoosiers who have been running
in this event during the past season
have seldom performed better than
0:27 flat. Griggs and Woods of
Butler, and< Cripe of Wabash appear
to be the hurdle kings among the
downstate schools. While Notre
Dame is not overly secure in this
event, Casey, and Johnson should
be able to make the run a fast one
for the visitors.
Barr and Layden of Notre Dame
will meet their hardest competition
in the century and 220-yard run
from Gray of Butler. In the state
meet of: 1923, the capital city flash
tied the record set up by Bill Hayes
of Notre Dame in. 1920 ■ at 0:9.41
In the season’s meets, Gray has
approached this mark very closely
and experts-are-expecting to‘ clock
him in a record breaker next Sat-
urday. The downstater, has. also
shown remarkable speed in the 220
stretch, and Young of Purdue has
clipped, the run in 0:23 4-5. The
state mark for the 220 run, also
set by Bill Hayes, looks secure for1
this year. No Hoosier sprinter has
shown the consistent speed - this
year, that the Irish flash and Olym-
pic competitor displayed four years
ago.,	'
The weight events -will in all
probability be featured by the work
of Oberst of Notre Dame, and Jones
of DePauw. The latter set up new
records in the college state meet
last week in the broad jump and
pole' vault. The Tiger star cleared
the bar at 12 feel;, 11. inches and
registered a leap in the broad jump
at 23 feet, 4 inches., Oberst will
have his favorite event all to him-
self, since the state has not pro-
duced a man this year who can
heave the shaft with the ability of
the giant' Kentuckian. ' x
Butler, won the' college ' state
meet with a total of 60 points, 20
points over' its nearest rival/ De-
-Pauw. The capital city team is
composed of a'coterie of star per-
formers who are being primed to
wrest the title from Notre Dame
next Saturday. .	, .

Chain O’ Lakes course on May 29.
A tentative agreement has been
reached with DePaul to play a match
at the Chain o’ Lakes course the
first week in-June. It is expected
that Dave O’Connor, captain and
star of the DePaul team, who was
unable to play in last Friday’s
game, will have recovered by that
time.
Ray O’Connor, a member of the
DePaul team, is perhaps the most
unique golfer in intercollegiate cir-
cles this year. He has only one
arm, but this fact does not seem
to alter his ability.. •	1
