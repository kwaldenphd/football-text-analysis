THE NEW SCHOLASTIC
When the annual Commencement number is published in June, the
• , career of the Scholastic as a weekly news and literary journal will have
come to an end. Upon the last of two-score volumes, finis will be writ-
■ ten. That inscription will close anarrative that tells of the lights and
shadows of " half a century, a narrative in which ther glories; of campus
and classroom, the triumphs, the unforseen defeats, have been told.
Fifty years is a long time, when the brief months that the student spends
beneath the dome are considered. It is to the credit of the Scholastic,
however, that during the half century of its existence, it has maintained
a personality vividly its own. ; It has been a friendly light to the student
- during that time. In its pages, the traditions of the past have been hap-
pily mingled with the emotions of,the present. • .■	(
A It has seemed, to many perhaps that the Scholastic during the past
?--rev^ yearsriras- been” unable 'to r reflect' truthfully • the ’changing "Notre
‘ Dame. . There, is, it is true, a place where past'and present do hot
meet, where the present is only the present. Just when that placets
reached few can ever tell. Few can say either, .whether the '.tradition of
yesterday is more • important than the necessity of today. । This news-
paper, which is born of necessity and of demand, cannot, however, dis-
< regard the past, nor the past as the Scholastic has represented it. If
- it has hopes, they are hopes for. success, and success of the kind which
• the Scholastic achieved. In' order to succeed; its editors . can hardly
-v do .better than to seek inspiration in the initiative, the loyalty, the
enthusiasm of the men who have edited the Scholastic during fifty years;
• It appears now that , the Scholastic may become a monthly maga-
zine devoted to letters.-' Its,future js now, however, fully determined.
Still, it is untrue to'say that the Scholastic is. dead, or that the spirit
‘ and the viewpoint which have dominated it'can ever die. Whatever, the
future brings to its name the past will glorify; From ,the radiance of
' that past, the editors'of the Daily may rightfully hope that some light
be cast to guide their own efforts.	.	*	.
The Editor Says ~
■t z - Bill Voss, oL the-election commit-
• ‘ tee of the S. A.-C., deserves com-
mendation. ' The big boy is a hard
. worker and not only-does he do the
' tasks the S. A. C. gives election
'•>’ committee men, but he does them
- ; • thoroughly. His many proposals
- never .require more'-than minor
.changes.

It’s a little late, to mention it, but
you ought to know, that: Hooda’sz
sister, Mita Thotut, was down for
the Senior Ball. She; just got here.
You see the stages are a little slow
yet out in that part of the country;
the trains are a little slow, and Mita
is a little' slow, Anyhow :we : are
now/trying, to persuade . her to re-
main over for the Senior B ail 5 next
year. At that rate she ought to be
just, about ready by- then. Mita is
a nice looking girl, and she brought
a bunch-.of; photographs along - to
prove it; ; She wears a veil; but-she
will’Jet anyone see the: photos. It
sounds funny doesn’t it? But then
I. suppose;-that .the sweet thing is-
just bashful. •	- _ ;	,-
■ She announced last night that;she
would do all she could; to make the
Ball a.’success next ’year. / She also,
said, “I would so love to; meet the
president,’ Mr. Gallagher, and the
vice . president,. Mr.'. Shean, and—. ”
But right there Hooda nudged her
and she closed up;. •	■
Earlier in the’day she was met at
the .station by Hooda. Hooda was
all excited as she alighted!' -Hooda
kissed her. and said; “How’s ma and
pa and the cow?” r ’	‘
“Shut up,”-said/Mita, “We ain’t
got.no more cow...,D’ya.want these
people ,to know it.” •
, - ■ Miss Thotut says • that she had- a
very pleasant; trip down, making it
all in one stretch except when they
ran her, car into a siding to load on*
cement. ■. “But,’-/ said-'she,'“the.next
car had straw in so;you see -I was
really fortunate after all.”
She’s a great girl.

SPORTS
Tuesday. afternoon we had two
real ball games when the Pre-Med-
ics staged a comeback and won from
the, Pharmacists 7-2 while the Civils
lost to the Miners 8-7.	. U
Fine pitching on the part of Gil-
singer, of the. Pre-Medics, striking
out 12 in the seven innings, and the
fielding of Cfaden and Gladen gave
some real, snap to the gariie. Cook
and Fox handled ai -meari stick, the
former getting a clout for the: cir-
cuit. Weibel demonstrated how it
• should be done when he made a
. spectacular catch in right field.

There has .been some criticism're-
garding the entrance of the Mechan-

the league already formed by the.
four other clubs because of the lack
of tinie all the teams cannot meet.
Would it be better if these three
clubs . together with one more club
form,a separate league and the win-
ner-/of each division play a / final
game for the championship, or is it
best to . leave the club standing as
.it is?	” '
Open-Air Theater; Girls Tour
, Library; Other Notes of
a Day
The Classical Department of . St.
Mary’s College presented the “Al-
cestic” of Euripides last evening on
the . campus, in’ the Open-Air’ The-
ater, which was modeled after the
stage of the Greek theater at the
University of California.
The intellectual appeal of the
dramatic restraint of the Greeks
and .the beauty , of Hellenic , grace
characterized the "play. Extolling
the virtues of friendship and hospi-
tality, the tragedy is laid in Pherae,
the kingdom of Admetus, and is
concerned with the .deliverance of
the queen, Alcestic, from. the. bonds
of an heroic, death. The distinctive-
ly Grecian chorus unified and gave
religious coloring to the. drama.
Miss Dorothy Doran, as Admetus,
portrayed well the regeneration of
the king from selfishness to noble
abnegation. Miss Genevieve Lang,
as . Alcestis, was queenly in the dig-
nity of poignant, sorrow.’ • Beauti-
ful in-its pathos iwas her farewell to
Admetus and her two children, roles
played by Alice -Rose- Carr arid
and Frances Krieg.
Miss Cathernie Boyle, as Lord
Heracles, manifested histrionic abil-
ity. Her compelling voice and ease
of manner were especially strong
in the passage between Heracles
and the cup-bearer, Miss Elizabeth
O’Hara.'. Miss Frances L'a Ponite,
in the role.’ of the life-greedy Than-
atos,/’was effective in her charac-
terization. ’
The other characters, Miss May-
belle Cass,'as handmaid, Miss' Ger-
maine Christen, as. the, earth-bound
Apollo, and the guards, attendants
and mourners completed the, cast.
The chorus, a link between actors
and- audience, displayed splendid
unison 'of action. The part of the
chorus leader was. taken by Miss
Helen-. Carroll, and-the other mem-
bers^were: Misses K., Bohn, H..Den-
yer, A. D. Dunham, ,D.: Fischer,-M.
Higgins; M. Nash, M. Rembusch, H..
Sayre/M. Schmauss,- L. Stieglitz, F.
Sturgis, R. Teriries and R.. Vendley.
The costumes and lighting effects
were, in a' great measure, .account-
able for [ the beauty of the. scenes.
The, Minute. Valse, .Soriia,. Serova,
was interpreted by E. Colgan; E:
Ryan, P. Periolat, C.,Ensel and M?
Simpson. St. Mary’s orchestra play-
ed: the' postlude arid furnished ac-

omore class held a consolation party
in the Seriior Club House. The de-
licious odors and merry laughter,
which emanated from the sanctum
during the afternoon, were proof
of the jolly good nature of the
occupants arid of their ability as
cooks. '
Miss Ruth Flood, president of the
class, obtained the. use of the club'
house, and for the time being the
sophomores reigned supreme. Miss
Jean Duncan; as chief , cook, wielded
a magic spoon. . Miss Angella Halli-
gan shared honors as chief “bottle
washer.” Miss Salome Fischer, as
general manager, gave conclusive
proof of her executive ability;
Mrs. , Nellie Thompson-Cullen and
her aunt, Mrs. E. Thompson,, of Salt
Lake City,, who are . driving through
to Boston, stopped off. at St. Mary’s
last evening for a brief visit. Mrs.
Cullen, ’79-’82, was a brilliant stu-
dent in English, art and music, and
during her stop at her Alma Mater
was ' especially interested : in the
changes which' have taken place in
the studio arid Conservatory of Mu-
sic.	■	* ■ ■	;

From OffStage
’ Two excellent, reasons account
for, the success -of the motion pic-;
ture' version of “The Little Minis-
; ter.”'/The first is'Sir James Barrie,
the. author, and. the second ,is Betty
; Compson; as “Babbie.” They corii-
..ibination,. .is: irresistible,’ and ..-Miss
Compson seems to . derive as much
. pleasure from, her role as a much
greater actress, Maude Adams, > did
; from another Barrie play, “Peter
Pan.” . It. is /doubtful ’if, a more
pleasing- Gavin Dishart could have;
been, found than- George . Hacka-
; thorne;; as the “Little Minister” he
: left little to be desired. ■ Others ■ in
; the cast were ;Nigel. Barrie, Guy Ol-
iver,/.Robert ' Brower : and Edwin
Stevens.
It; is-interesting-to note that, the
similarity, in theme which “The Lit-
tle Minister”' bears, .to Hauptmann’s
“The.Weavers.”? 'Both are concern-
ed, with the revolt .which takes place
among a . poverty-stricken people
I when the limit of human endurance
i has . been , reached. Where Haupt-
mann -seizes an opportunity to cry
out against economic oppression;
Barrie succeeds ,in telling a love
[ Story Jas well,-and this he does .with
i the humor and sentiment which
[mark all his works. Hauptmann Js;
[no doubt, , the greater - playwright,
[but.there, are those Svho,. like Philip
.Guedalla, will, / always1 be grateful
for, “the cheerful • clatter of Sir
[James' Barrie’s ' cans as< he. goes
[about with the.milk of.human kind-
ness.” ■	.'	- •
What is ■ more interesting than a
well-conducted library? The mem-
bers of - .the classes in Magazine
Writing.' and; in High School Meth-
ods who visited the. South Bend
Public; Library .Wednesday, are
unanimous in the opinion that for
pure interest few things 'surpass
such institutions; .	/
' ' Miss Florence- Tutt, head librari-
an, conducted the girls and the Sis-
ters; -by whom they were accom-
panied, through the various /depart-
ments . and explained in detail the
workings .of the library system? The

and by the number -of ^persons who

TRACKMEN TO
COMPETE FOR
STATE TITLE
Lafayette Scene of Meet; Mile
Relay Will be Feature
Event
; On next Saturday the Notre
Dame track team will send their*
speed and strength against a bril-
liant array of down state athletes,
at the Indiana State Meet to be held
this year at Lafayette. The 1923
track classic "will attract a large
number of stars from Wabash, But-
ler, Purdue, Indiana, Notre Dame
and several of the smaller colleges,
with the result that the greatest
speed men and field stars of the
state will be brought together, to
compete for the state championship.
’ Layden and Barr will meet some
fast competition in'Tykle, of Pur-,
due, who was clocked in the century
last week in .09' 3-5. Butler, Wa-
bash and DePauw will have men in
this event who have been running
about .10 flat. The 220 will also
see some speed from Tykle and his
teammate,’ Maddox, with Barr run-
ning in .21 4-5., Montague, who has
been.taking the 440 in .50 3-5 and
his running -mate, McTiernan, will
be set up with Caraway,: of Butler,
a .51 flat man, Sweeney, of Wabash,
.50 4-5, and Cady, of DePauw. Wa-
. bash will send in a fast half miler
" who is credited, with 1.58,.and will
. have the company of Disney and
1 Barber, of Notre Dame, also Cady,
of DePauw, during the run. In the
mile and two mile, Kennedy, Shee-
han, Cox and Wentland will be on
the program with a fast field, who'
have been running the mile about
, z4.27 and 4.31 and the two mile .in
9.50 and 10 flat. Desch, in the low,
and Casey and - Walsh, in .the high
hurdles wilL meet a fair field that
have been topping the timbers in
. around -.15 3-5 for. the high : and
.26, 3-5 in.t he low. Thome, of Wa-
bash',leading shot’ putter ' of
the downstate schools, with a heave
of 42 feet, 7 inches. Lieb and Flynn,
• of the Irish squad, have been toss-
ing the brass knob in the neighbor-
hood of 43.6 and 42. With the
exception of .Notre Dame, the In-
diana schools do not seem to have
any discus throwers of note. . Last
Saturday Lieb set up a new field
record of 137 feet 6 inches, while
the downstaters are only, measuring
off about 118 feet. '. Moes’ javelin
record of 196 feet does not seem' to
be in any immediate danger unless
a dark horse, is uncovered before
Saturday.
The mile relay race will be one of
the biggest features on the card and
a close race, is looked for between
Notre Dame and Butler,<the latter
carrying the baton in the fast time
of 3.25 1-5. . Wabash" is also, ex-
pected to put in a fast quartet.
