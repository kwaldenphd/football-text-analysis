NOTRE DAME AND
GOLDEN TORNADO
GAME POSTPONED
YESTERDAY’S GAME CALLED
OFF ON ACCOUNT OF
HEAVY RAIN
Coach.Keogan’s baseball proteges
will tackle the Golden Tornado at
Atlanta this afternoon. The teams
were scheduled to meet -yesterday
afternoon, but a heavy rain neces-
sitated the calling off of the game.
“Red” Magevney, premier Irish hur-
ler, will probably appear on the
mound in the opening game for
Notre Dame.
Georgia Tech players will have
the edge ,on the Notre Dame dia-
mond men because the changeable
weather has hindered the condition-
ing plans of Coach Keogan. “ The
southerners have played many hard
practice games and look to this, ad-
vantage for a victory. The Irish
showed early season form in the
last few workouts and Coach Keo-
gan is not confident of victory.
However, he.is.more interested in
the training his men will get out of
this southern trip than in winning
games.	.	, -
Although Keogan may give his
entire crew a chance to perform in
today’s game, it is probable that
the following men will start the
game: Mageveny, pitch; Silver,
catch; Nolan, first; Ash, second;
Pearson, third; Captain Sheehan,
short; and Reese, Dunne and Berg-
man will, take care of the outer
gardens.
The squad will meet the Univer-
sity of Tennessee nine at Knoxville
on- Monday afternoon.;,;
Chemical Society
Hears Dr. Shupp
The Northern Indiana Section of
the American Chemical -society
held its regular meeting Wednes-
day evening at 7:45 pl m. at the
South Bend Y. M. C. A. Dr. A. F.
Shupp, director of the American
Institute laundry of Jdliet, Ill.,
spoke on the numerous benefits to
the laundry industry of recent
chemical research. He combined
the theoretical and the practical,
and illustrated with several pieces
of fabrics the effects of unscien-
tific laundering methods. ,
Dr. Shupp, was well able to dis-
.cuss all phases of the launder-
ing business, having had wide ex-
perience in this line for many years.
His talk proved very interesting to.
the appreciative audience that at-
tended the lecture.

at which Professor. George Shuster,
honorary president of the club at-
tended. Papers were read by Har-
ry Flannery, Corbin Patrick, Jerry
Holland, and Anse Miller. j
A rare first edition was presented
for the inspection of ..the men pres-
ent. The .book was a first edition
of “Imaginary Portraits” by Walter
Pater and is one of the most valu-
able books on the' campus.' . It is
the property of Prof. Shuster. It
was presented by Walter Pater to
the man purported .to be the model
for, “Marius the Epicurean.” The
book contains a letter froiri Pater to

JAMES HAMMOND MADE COL-
ONEL; FR. M’NAMARA TALKS;
PLAN ON BANQUET *
Janies. K. Hammond was elected
colonel of the Kentucky club for
next year at a smoker-meeting of
that' organization Thursday night in
Clark’s, banquet, room. " Edwin C.
Bohmer was made, liteutenant-col-
onel and Robert N. Wathen received
the office-of revenue collector. •
Hammond, who is. at present lieu-
tenant-colonel of the organization,
is a junior in the. department- of
mechanical engineering and hails
from Louisville. . He. will succeed
Russell R. McClure, the present
colonel, at theybeginning of next
year. :
' The Rev. George McNamara, as-
sistant librarian, was an enthusias-
tic speaker at the affair. In a brief
talk;' he • outlined the aims of the
club and advised a revival of the
old time spirit so characteristic of
.the Kentuckians who were the first
to; found a campus club.
The organization is now planning
to give a large banquet in South
Bend in the latter part of the school
year for the benefit of members.
Reports that will be submitted to
the executive committee of . the
Democratic club at a meeting at
noon today will show more than 350
enrolled members.(	’	'
A constantly rriounting number
of enrollment cards are’ being
signed daily on the campus through
efforts of the executive commit-
tee.. Approximately 225 signatures
have been enlisted during the past
four days. A quota of 650 mem-
bers is the goal of the Democratic
organization; , . < ' . . .
—The^campaign”' f dr.“iriembers; \vill
probably be .continued, until Tues-
day noon. : Membership is not lim-
ited to students of voting age? ' ‘In-
asmuch as . the chief. purpose of the
club is to enable the student to be-
come . acquainted with the’ party’s
principles, men of non-voting age
are especially, invited to join.
With other campus activities
busily occupying the .. attention
.during the week, the execu-
tive committee has reached a de-
cision to bring no speakers to the
campus, until after April 23, when
the Easter recess ends. . Officers
of the club are in touch with speak-
ers from Indiana and other states

Owen Moore Comedy
on Tonight’s Program
What promises, to be the best
comedy in Washington hall this year
will be shown tonight in “Her.Tem-
porary Husband.” The picture, a
First National production, features
Owen Moore, - Sylvia Breamer and
Sidney Chaplin.	-	\
The’. story centers about a girl
who married an old man because a
will -with- a million dollars: attached;
to it forced her to do so. She then
discovers four old men claiming her
as wife; she does not know what to
do-and this makes the laughs. ;.
Commerce Students
r Must Register Soon
■ ;It -was announced yesterday by
Prof.’'McCormack, assistant dean of
the ' College of : -.Commerce,' ' that
spring registration ‘ for commerce
students’will begin immediately af-
ter Easter vacation. - Registration
will: close on May 15; and all com-
merce men' must' hand in their
blanks by that. time. ’.
Registration will be conducted by
means of blanks that , will be dis-
tributed in all the halls. Men who
intend, to • register are advised. to
consult/ their faculty advisers re-
garding" their elective subjects in
order that :the.registration' foi* next
year’s classes will be complete.
Scallan Promises
Dome As Scheduled
More assurance of the 1924 Dome
appearing? on scheduled, time was
ascertained yesterday when it was
announced by Editor Jack Scallan
that practically all ‘ of the engrav-
ing has been sent, to the Pontiac
Engraving Company of Chicago, er
graver for the Dome, and the ath-
letic section has already, gone to
press.':‘	‘ j
The business staff of the Dome
is finishing up its successful adver-
tising campaign. It is through'the
efforts of many juniors helping
John Bartley, business manager,
that the campaign has been so suc-
cessful.- . •	,	\ '
,The outside demand for the pub-
lication, is" much ..larger than ex-
pected. It is said that the success
of the 1923 Dome is the cause, for
this unusual demand.. A new plan
of distribution will probably be in-
augurated this year in order to
avoid the usual waiting in line.
.The Day Students’ first annual
vaudeville show which was presented"
Thursday and Friday nights in
Washington hall, was acomplete
success, both in merit and financial-
ly, although the Thursday night •
crowd, because it was South Bend
night, was not so large as an enter-
tainment of this calibre usually
draws. The “day dogs” have dis-
tinguished themselves by collecting
an assortment of acts of a charac-
ter that is seldom excelled on the
professional stage. The eight acts
were of all sorts,' ranging from
black-face comedy to dramatic
sketches. Approximately 1,200
South Bend people together with a
large number of students witnessed
the performance.	,
Orchestra Opens Program
The University orchestra, under
the direction of Norbert Engles, be-
gan the program with an overture.
This completed, the curtains parted
and Laurence Deeter announced, in
the prologue, that the purpose of
the show was “to provide bizarre
entertainment.”
The Glee Club quartet, composed
of Vernon Rickard, Arthur Halley,
George Koch, and Robert Welch,
sang several old familiar songs in
ari act entitled, “A Few Moments
of Harmony.” During the act/ two
views of the dome were thrown up-
on the curtains and they furnished
a novel background. ’	.
Comedians Perform .;
: ~ “Blackface-Chatter” -was; a-'skitv- <
featuring . Charles . Springer : and
Dick Lightfoot, gentlemen of color.
Springer began by delivering a lec-
ture on “Education”—which he
considered to be only a matter of
taste—but he was interrupted by
Lightfoot, a college graduate. They
carried on the usual “line,” cracked
the usual faculty jokes, and as a
whole, were clever and entertairi- :
ing.	■ . :	' v
William J. Furey, class of ’23,'
and former day’student and soloist
of the Glee club, assisted by Arnold
Alexander, pianist, offered a pro-
gram of more than Orpheum circuit
quality, which was one of the inost
excellent on the entire bill- Mr.
Arnold played an old popular num- x
ber which was well received.
“Amen Corner” Scores' Hit.
A sketch named “The Amen Cor-'
ner,” depicting a familiar haunt of
Notre Dame students, would surely,
rate at least 95 per cent by the Chi-
cago Tribune. The phrase “true to
life” well describes this act as' the
settings were transported from, the
Oliver hotel, and were exact from
the bell hop?s uniform to the phone'
booth and drinking fountain. The .
principals were Jerry Fox, ’ A. E.
Fellner, Gilbert Shaefer, Lester
Grady, Jimmie. Jones, and Carl
Lind.	.
. A “Musical Fantasy” appeared
next on : the bill, and consisted of
a program of selections by a .quar-
tet composed of three violins and
a piano. This act was variegated by
the appearance of Miss Irene Sav-
age, dancer, .and by the tenor solo
of Richard Griffin. The. quartet
was composed of Bernard Schmitt,
Sidney Eder, Arnold Small, and
Joseph Ryan. •	'	•	••

THE DAILY’S STAND FOR NOTRE DAME
Aunion building to be built as soon as possible.
A well-organized student body, residing on the campus.
True recognition of good scholarship and a better'appreciation
"for. the efforts of .men in campus activities. ,
WE’LL WATCH
The Methodists are making plans to publish “a great national
newspdper.”- We who are interested in the endeavor will stand pa-
tiently on the* sidelines and watch/the efforts with attentive wonder,
. hoping that we may learn the formula of their efforts.
’ The thing lias been attempted before, but not with logic. Many
newspapers claim to be national institutions; one paper goes so far as
to claim to be the “world’s greatest- newspaper.” A Catholic daily
newspaper also has been begun, but only. in presenting the Catholic
:	viewpoint on certain events is it really valuable. The Christian Science
Monitor is a paper with national pretensions. It is a good paper—
for consideration of its opinions, but not for its news. ' . .	..
By. its very nature,-news must (be new. The .distinctive-character-
istic of journalism is timeliness, ephemeralness. Comment on the news
is: journalism, too, of course, arid though it may be a little late, it may
not be very late. When ■writing is such that it is as good tomorrow
as today, it-is no longer journalism, but is on the way to becoming
literature; The editorials of. Henry Watterson/ for instance, believed
‘ to be powerful arid lasting when written now have little interest, except
that, of association with the great name of. “Marse Henry.” The re-
porter arid editor write;for today; the late'messenger is disregarded.
•_ .Because of this the efforts of these new publishers will be. the
object of much journalistic, observation. Perhaps they have discovered
an eventful recipe.	i ?.	■
BOY GUIDANCE AND MAN BUILDING
‘ ; The annals of history glow in their accoiirits of famous men. Ev?
■ery age, since the’"beginning of’time (has-had its heroic leaders who" have
-henefitted mankind in some general way. And never has there /been
a. single/instance when men did 'not manifest, either internally or ex-
ternally, or both, that insatiable emotion of joy ,ever the success of a
•fellowman.	;	• -	• • /
. Our penitentiary records, too,! reveal the lives of men—men who
.from the moment, of their, conception had :potentialities equally -as
.promising as their successful neighbor ; men who, having been misguid-
ed in their youth, used their leadership ability to organize not gather-
ings of statesmen, tacticians, arid ’bankers, but gangs of. smugglers,
thugs arid burglars? And these unfortunate individuals who during a
moment of weakness slipped into crimej are looked down upon with dis-
gust by honest ^citizens./ . , .	. , .	: '
: That man should regard his fellowmen thus is only, human. But
as a nation^ if ,we want to reduce crime to a minimum, and are to con-,
tinue producing the type of. leaders upon whom the civilization of the
world must depend, we must destroy the alluring evil forces that grip
and overpower youth before he reaches manhood; qTo postpone such
methods of amelioration until a child is more or less mature is to hasten
the possibility of that child’s downfall and proportionately lessen its
chance to succeed.	:	;	< ■ -. •
The rapid'growth of bur cities has caused a great decrease in the
amount of ’ playground territory on which the child can find pure,
healthful recreation, and as a result the child-is forced to. play either
in .the dirty. streets where traffic is a constant menace to life, in, the
s filthy,; alleys .where, disease lurks in abundance/or in' the stuffy pool
rooms where life, is enacted and visualized sordidly.	• ?
The Knights of Columbus,-throughout\the United States have.real-
ized these facts/ and;as a step to do their share, to alleviate what dang-
ers they: can/ they have become the sponsors of a national “Boy Guid-
ance” movement. In short, they have been influential in installing
here , at Notre Dame a two-year graduate’ course which will give men
a practical and'theoretical experience in the.boy work from the phys-
ical, the educational, and the vocational standpoints. Directing the en-
.terpiise :is Brotlir B	has,made a life-long study of the
fyouth rind mob psychology, and he is,probably the best authority in
.America on the subject. . In Jiis hands rest the factors which will de-
- termine whether! or/not our boys of today .will be the leaders of tomor-
.row. And the Knights of Columbus, cognizant that we can reap only
. as ;we sow, should be congratulated on their splendid efforts.

What Others Say
Over-Organization
An over-organized .cariipus is:
more of a detriment to a university i
than an under-organized campus.:
The former means split, scattered;
interest, the latter, one interest—,
one university. ,	!
Northwestern is over-organized I
and the .work that is done is only!
50 per cent efficient. If there were!
half as many committees, half as'
many - meetings, half . as many;
“jobs,” the student body would get;
somewhere. As it is, the students!
are worked to death and not by:
their professors.	:
If students sleep in their classes!
it is not the professor’s fault. The:
pcor dears are resting between:
meetings. A few big organizations!
supported by the entire student:
body would function far more sue-;
cessfully- than half a dozen work-
ing at cross purposes.
How many students are,not “in
activities”? How many, who are in
them, ever discuss their studies;!
how many, ever take subjects for]
the knowledge to be gained? How!
many have time for an exchange!
of philosophy? How many students!
have a philosophy?—Daily North-:
western.	: v,	■
The charge is often made against
Joseph Conrad—it was brought
against him recently by Frederick
Paulding, in his lecture on “Lord
Jim”' at St. Mary’s—that he is a
fatalist. Just what means Mr.
Paulding took to prove his asser-,
tion are not known, but the usual
procedure is to hold up the title of
Conrad’s volume “Chance” and
then, by way of clinching the argu-
ment, to quote from “Heart of
Darkness”—“Destiny! Droll thing
that life is—that mysterious ar-
rangement of merciless logic for a
futile purpose.” By this time the
novelist is not only catalogued as a
fatalist, but set down as a pessi-
mist as well.
This misconception arises from a
failure to take into account a fun-
damental distinction which Conrad
makes between the real and the,
spiritual. Having spent the best
part of his life in the Far East,
Conrad naturally became imbued,
with eastern philosophy, and when!
he began to write, this influence
tinctured that which the Russians;
had upon him. He sees but one re-j
ality—the spiritual; and it is only;
with regard to externals that he isi
fatalistic. It is only the soul that;
matters; its triumphs are the only’
triumphs worth while, and its fail-;
ures are the only real failures. !
Circumstances pile up against’
Lord Jim with irresistible force; he;
appears to be the unfortunate,
plaything of destiny, and Conrad;
devotes a good part of the book to
emphasizing the enormity of his
single sin of cowardice. But Jim
‘riumphs, and when he does, it is
not by winning back the esteem of
those from whom he fled. So far as
the world is concerned, he is still
the pariah, but in his soul- be has
that serene happiness of knowing
that he is at peace' with himself.:
Aridjn “Victory” the theme of the*

NEW YORK UNIVERSITY—“If
more college men were active in
politics today,; the result would un-
doubtedly be an administration even
more efficient than the present one,”
said James P. Sinnott, secretary and
son-in-law of Mayor Hyland of New
York City, in a recent lecture.! He'
outlined the effects that would fol-
low and which would prove bene-
ficial to the city, state and national
governments?
Seas arid the girl .he rescued from
a traveling orchestra.
Even the most devote’d of Con-
rad’s followers admit a' superficial'
tendency to fatalism, but the bald
statement that he is a fatalist is one
that seems itoy lack substantiation.
Far from being a fatalist, Conrad
embodies the idealism. o!f ‘the- East
to which he adds a note of positiv-
ism derived from his Slavic ances-
try.
Becriuse he has written what he
saw with the clear vision'of an art-
ist, he has accomplished what no
other modern author has accom-
plished, and has • carved his own
niche in the World of English writ-
ers. ' And, whether you like it or
not, it is fairly difficult to say, with
no fear" of contradiction,° that his
position is noth in the foremost
rank.—J. S. B. ■ ; •

ST LOUIS U. SIGNS
IRISH GRID STAR
HARVEY BROWN TO ASSIST
WITH LINEMEN; MAHER'
COES TO COLORADO
Harvey Brown, captain of No-
,tre Danie’s 1923 football team and
selected by Walter Camp for an all-
American guard position at the
close of last season, has signed a
contract with St. Louis university
to become assistant football coach
next fall. Brown succeeds Coach
Rademaker, who assisted Savage
last fall, and will take charge of
the linemen. '	•
Harvey Brown has been an out-
standing figure in the Notre Dame
football camp for the past two years
and won recognition for his consis-
tent' playing from the sport critics
of the middle west and east. Against
Army and Princeton, the diminutive
Irish leader was particularly effect-
ive. Brown gained the attention
not only of the sport critics but also
of many of Notre , Dame opponents
as was manifested in ex-Captain
Mulligan’s magnificent tribute to
the Irish leader’ and his remarkable
team.
Graduation in June will take nine
veterans from the ranks of the St.
Louis collegians, seven of the pass-
ing gridders being linemen. How-
ever, from the reserves of last fall
and from the yearling ranks, much
promising material is in view, and
with the introduction of' the Notre
Dame coaching system the football
oiitlook in the Mound City is par-
ticularly bright. . >
; “Red” Maher, scintillating half
back on the 1923 eleven, has also
entered the ranks of former. Notre
Dame football players who are
coaching. Maher has signed as ath-
letic director of Mount St.. Charles
college, Helena, Colo.- Little is
known of the western; school as it
is a recent arrival' among Rocky
’ mountain colleges.
Maher will, be remembered in
Notre Dame football, history as one
of the shiftiest half backs that ever
performed on Cartier field. Bob
Reagan, also a regular on the 1923
aggregation will become assistant
coach at Utah university, Salt Lake
City, where he will drill the line-
men. Reagan has performed in the
pivot position on the Fighting Irish
machine for three years and was
one of the hardest playing centers
in the country.,
WABASH CAPTAIN
Interhall Batsmen to
Contend for Trophy
' With all indications pointing to a
successful interhall baseball season
from which there is certain to ap-
pear a coterie of slugging artists,
plans have been made to honor the
interhall player hitting the largest
number of home runs during the
season. On the day when the final
section of the * Interhall league is
played off, the home run king of the
campus will be awarded the Rockne
Trophy.
The first, section of the schedule
was marked by three home runs,
credited to Joe McKeown of Corby,
Red Smith of Walshf and Tom
Green of Freshman. The second
section of the hall schedule will be
played off tomorrow, beginning at
9:30. The pairings follow: Morn-
ing games, Sorin-Badin, Cartier
field; Carroll-Sophomore, Brown-
son campus. Afternoon games,
Walsh-Freshman, Cartier field; Day-
Cadillac, and Brownson - Corby,
Brownson campus.

The coaching problem at the Uni-

week for at least three years when
it .was announced that Burt Ing-

wersen had been assistant to Coach
Bob Zuppke.
Ingwersen was the only nine let-

Purple Nine Wins
Opener from Day
The first section of the Interhall
baseball schedule was completed
Thursday afternoon when Brown-
son hall .defeated the Off-campus
aggregation, 19-3, in a four-inning
game, cut short by unfavorable
weather. The teams had originally
been scheduled to meet last Sun-
day, but owing to the fact that the
Day men were not completely or-
ganized, the encounter was . post-
poned till last Thursday.
The downtown ball tossers gave
a very creditable performance con-
sidering the fact that they have had
little or no organized practice.
Grady of Brownson twirled a good
game for the Purple nine allowing
the Dodgers but one score in three
innings. Gandolphi relieved Grady
for the last frame.

URBANA, Ill., April 11—The
University of Illinois baseball
squad left here yesterday morn-
ing on the annual spring training
trip which will take them straight
south to the Gulf States. The op-
ening game on the card will be
with the University of Mississippi
nine.
Coach Lundgren of the Illinois
varsity is well fortifield with bat-
tery men and several of his star
twirlers are also available for in-
field and outfield duty. , The .two
leading mainstays are. Captain Wal-
ly Roettger and Lefty O’Connor,
veteran moundsmen from last
year’s squad. Both men are power-
ful hitters and will probably bear
the most of -the slab work in the
Sucker’s race for conference hon-
ors. Barta, Morrison, Binger and
“Red” Grange are the other four
men included on the Illini pitching
staff. . Kinderman, a regular on the
initial sack, is another ( pitcher al-
most on a par with the best in the
Illini ranks*.. The squad will carry
foui- catchers - who are dependable
in nearly every department of the
backstop, game. .	.
