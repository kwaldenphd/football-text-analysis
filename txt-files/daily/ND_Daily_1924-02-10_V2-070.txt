Five Loop Games
Are Played Today
The five scheduled interhall bas-
ketball games to be played in the
gymnasium today will in all prob-
ability be the hardest contested bat-
tles that have thus far appeared on
the iriterhall schedule. . The games
will mark the half-way point for
the season, only four remaining
games until the champion will be
decided.
The various, teams . have been
practicing throughout the week,
and the teams now leading in the
interhall schedule will be forced to
go the limit if they expect to keep
the lead.
The Carroll team, which has lead
the field since the beginning, will
be without the services of Vince
McNally, star forward, when it
meets the fast Sophomore team this
afternoon.' McNally was injured
last Sunday, while playing against
the Freshman hall squad.

Invitations are extended to Notre
Dame students to attend the

CAMPUS
BY-PATHS
So the days pass.. We are awake
at dawn, and going to bed sleep
away the morning. , But, as has
been observed, a Cotillion is noth-
ing more or less than a Cotillion,
which like Christmas comes only
once a year. Only once in a life-
time comes the “Well-Dressed
Mah.”	-o-
So yesterday afternoon, as had
been advertised, Tiny Milbauer re-
ceived the cup. Any one of the
countless number of. spectators
will describe its magnificence to
you. They will relate an impressive
scene in; which the Editor-in-Chief
stood with bared head—there in
the raging blizzard—calling, plead-
ing for me to come. fortli and de-
liver the cup. Let it be said to my
credit that I responded, crying
“here”—the only difficulty being
that some forty or fifty misguided
individuals answered with the
same cry. I was insulted, indig-
nant that my name-should betaken
in vain, and forthwith left the scene
for several hours’ rest that I might
write this chronicle in a semi-wide-
awake manner.
-o- -o-
Jerry Fox, manager and spokes-
man for Milbauer, spoke very kind-
ly, of his protege, remarking that
bids for making Tiny’s monogram-,
ed .sweater were in, and that the
contract went to Omar the Tent-
maker. Jerry seemed very fond of
the cup (on exhibition in their
quarters in Corby) and seemed to
think it would be very useful. I
am told that a Thomas cat sings at
times beneath their window.
So, ever-patient reader, I lay the
blame on circumstances in' regard,
to my non-appearance ' yesterday.
Incidentally, I. may have been , dis-
tracted by my pleasant memories
^of the little dance held Friday ev-
ening. As you know I i was there,
very much, thank you, and missed
not. a moment of the festivities.
The fact is I stayed up until 5 (a.
m.,.-of course) to be.sure.of not
missing a thing. Yes, Miss Grumpy
had the honor—and I had the pleas-
ure.. ’ -o- -0-.
I. had intended letting Miss
Grumpy comment today upon, the
boys but it seems she worked too
swiftly and found . out too much.
So I must give only a few scattered
remarks of hers that might interest
the circulation . (the paper’s, not
yours). •	-o- -p-
Anse Miller was the ■ first ap-
praisal, and he nearly stumped my
fair one for adjectives. She finally
stuttered something about “these
Englishmen certainly do wear even-
i ing clothes.”' She fain.'would stop
to examine his stringless. dancing
pumps but reason prevailed and we
passed on to the -next exhibit.
-o- , -o-
Little Miss Grumpy seemed to en-
joy the dance very much. I must
say in her behalf that she gets it
no matter where it is, meaning
scandal, of course. I would' not
hesitate a moment to recommend
,‘her for a position similar to mine
on the St. Mary’s Chimes ‘ (free
Mv.). In fact, the 1924 edition
of my red-backed notebook is
crammed with notes, some -undis-
cipherable, that relate to' the do-
ings uncovered^ by Agatha (her
first name). -	' . ■

COMMERCE SCHOOL
HEARS O’DONNELL
Delivers First Lecture of Series on
“Open Door of the
World.”
Over three hundred commerce
students were addressed in Wash-
inton hall yesterday by the Hon.
H. P. O’Donnell of Chicago, onThe
subject “The Open Door of the
World,” which proved to be a very
interesting and timely talk. His
lecture yesterday was a forerunner
of his future lecture “The Open
Door of China,” which will be dis-
cussed at a later date.
There are six main outlets of the
world’s commerce, all but one of
them being controlled by England,
Mr. O’Donnell asserts, the Panama
Canal alone being operated by the
United States. Sir Walter Raleigh
once said, “The nation that controls
the sea controls the commerce of
the world, and the nation that con-
trols the commerce . controls the
world itself.” The present sea
power of England is due to the
fact that all the English states-'
men since that . time have be-
lieved and exercised, the theory.
England controls Gibraltar, the
gateway to the Mediterranean, and
therefore controls the commerce of
all the countries bordering on that
sea. In war this is a vital necessity
to England’s welfare. It was Eng-
land’s foresighted statesmen who
foresaw the importance of the
Mediterranean, many years ago,
and thus, when a French company
failed at building the Suez Canal,
the British took over the work
.themselves_.and ..finished .it... .The
canal not only gives them access to
the East and the Orient ,but also
both-the openings of the Mediter-
ranean. England therefor controls
the entire trade and commerce car-
ried to and from the countries bor-
dering. the sea.
The Panama Canal, Mr. O’Don-
nell stated, was one of the most
important as .well as one of the wis-
est' steps ever undertaken by the
United States. Before this canal
was built,’the American’ ships had
to circumnavigate the Cape of Good
Hope, off the point of Africa, a
colony which was in the hands of
England. The United States was
dependent upon this as a filling sta-
tion for the ships, on their way to
the East, and were under the Brit-
ish guns; a-difficulty which the Pan-
ama Canal did away with.
China has. always had a closed
door policy, the speaker went on. to
say, and it was through the efforts
of the United States that China
opened her ports to the world’s
trade. China was often forced.to
trade with England, the English
ships carrying off great quantities
of opium. To overcome this, the
Chinese government captured a
number of British sailors aS they
came on-shore one day. They kept

NOLAN WINS STATE
ORATORICAL MEET
N. D. Victorious Again This Year;
Wabash and Butler Finish
Second and Third,
Mark E. Nolan, representing
Notre Dame in the annual contest
of the Indiana Oratorical Associa-
tion, won the first prize with his
subject “The Guardian of the Con-
stitution.” The orations were de-
livered in the Butler College chapel
at Indianapolis Friday evening.
Wabash won the second prize
through L. M. Ross’ efforts, speak-
ing on “A Cure for the Radical.”
Third prize was accorded to Miss
Kathryn Bowy of Butler College,
who spoke- on “The Outlawry of
War.”
This victory by Nolan ■ gives
Notre Dame the state championship
in this contest for the second con-
secutive year, Ray Gallegher, ’23,
having won last year with, his “A
Century of Isolation.” The win-
ning of the state contest gives the
winner the right to compete in the
interstate contest. This Gallegher
did,- and was-an -easy winner in the
Interstate Collegiate Oratorical
Contest.	' .	;
Fifteen states and 120 colleges
and universities are members of
association. Mark Nolan will rep-
resent the state of Indiana, as well
as Notre Dame, in this interstate
contest. Nolan is a forceful speak-
er and there is every reason to be-
lieve that Notre Dame will continue
her oratorical march to victory in
in the interstate contest, which will
be held in the spring.
GLEE CLUB MASCOT ,
Announcement of the arrival of
a mascot for the, Notre' Dame Glee
club is reported by Joseph Casas-
santa, assistant director. The mas-
cot is dressed, in the familiar Irish
green, and bears a whistle in his
back that pronounces him a tenor.
The mascot is the gift of Miss Betty
Tynan, of Indianapolis, as a result
of the between-semesters trip of the
club. The club has .in mind a con-
test for the naming of the youngs-
ter. No pedigree is ascertainable
as yet. ’
. ' , - THE. CONTEST |
And still the leaders in both divisions of the DAILY’S Best- !
Organization Contest will pull away from the pursuers. The Mono- I
gram and Ohio clubs seem to hold a commanding lead in their re-., j
spective classes, and are now out in front with more than two-hun- j
dred.votes advantage over their nearest competitors. The Scrib-. j
biers and the Louisiana-Mississippi clubs were the only other or- !
|	ganizations in their divisions to

MICHIGAN PUCKMEN
DEFEATJRISH, 2-1
Stack and Mouch Star Before Co-
tillionites; Teams Evenly
Matched.
The Wolverine hockey team lead
by Captain Kahn invaded Notre
Dame yesterday afternoon and de-
feated the Irish sextet 2-1 in a-fast
and bitterly fought game on the St.
Mary’s rink before a gallery of sev-
eral hundred spectators, among
whom were many of the Cotillion
guests.
The local puck team under the
guidance of Captain McSorley,
made a wonderful showing against
the Michigan aggregation and held
the visitors scoreless during the last
two periods. Beresford of the
Wolverines caged the puck twice in
the openind fram and . Jimmie
Stack registered on counter for the
Irish in the same period.
Team work did not stand out
prominently on either side and the
individual work cost the Irish the
game on several occasions, when a
Notre Dame forward .was forced to
handle the puck alone in front of
the visitors’ cage. . Michigan dis-
played some clever passing and
dribbling but were forced to their .
utmost during the entire game, due
to the terriffic fight put up by the
local sextet. If time counted for
anything in yesterday’s game, No-
tre Dame should have won, since
the Irish lost -little time in useless
dribbling but took advantage of ev- ,
ery opening.
Jimmy Stack was the outstand-
ing performer for the local .outfit, '
but~because he -was'forced to'play ‘ ’
a lone hand several times, the ef-
fectiveness of his worlc did not
manifest itself in the'final score.
Charley Mouch played a whale of
a\ defensive . game and took no
small, part in offensive tactics. Mc-
Sorley did not play with his usual
speed and cleverness although at
times some of his old form,flashed
up when he raced down the ice with
the . elusive puck. Bob Irmager
played a nice game both at defence
and offence and -with a little more
game experience should become a .
powerful scoring factor.
On the whole, both teams, were
evenly matched and it was nobody’s
game until the final whistle. The 1
last period, Notre Dame threatened
to tie the score several times, but
in nearly every case, the Wolver-
ine defense men were able to dis- •
pose of the. charging Irishman who -
was -carrying the puck single-
handed^
Michigan’s offensive game was
strong while on the. middle of the
ice, but not infrequently it weak-

ANOTHER STATE CHAMPION
A law student defending the highest tribunal of his profession—
the .United States Supreme Court—has just added to the fame of our
alma mater by achieving the rank of the foremost'collegiate orator in
the state of Indiana. -	.	. „
' His victory is significant to the men of Notre Dame, because it
retains -for us the honor which was gained" in the same forum last year,
and establishes our school 'as a leader in another field .of endeavor.
We will grasp Mark Nolan’s hand in warm appreciation for that reason.
But we will "’also grasp-Mark Nolan’s hand in sincere admiration!
because his accomplishment is one which . contains for us not . only aj
measure of scholastic pride, but likewise an example for the man’sj
world.	•
Our fellow classman is a student of the law, and his choice of “The;
Guardian of the Constitution”, as a vehicle for his oratorical abilities is;
the choice of good judgment. - He is vitally interested in the law, ini
the supreme court, and in everything which concerns them. . When he!
steps upon the platform he is performing a duty to his profession. He!
. is effective; ,	'
Should Mark Nolan take the rostrum to discuss, say, “The Value
of Radium in the Treatment of Disease,” he would no doubt deliver a
. gramatically perfect speech, but he would not be speaking with his
heart behind it. He would not. be effective.
The conclusion is only too plain. A man is a great speaker in the
‘•degree to which lie is absorbed in his topic. You will hear a poor
talker become eloquent when speaking upon a subject, seriously affect-
. ing him, and a good talker-become boresome while discussing a matter
he is little concerned with. But when you find a good talker, talking
_ upon a topic vital to him, as our new state champion does, you will:
hear a rattling good speech,
BEING EDUCATED
. ; In.one.of his. lectures at Cambridge Professor Quiller Couch spoke;
of the.kind of man of whom a university may be proud. .His statement;
. . is worth consideration. “The man we are proud to send forth from!
our schools,” he said, “will be remarkable less for something, he can;
take, out of his wallet and exhibit for knowledge, than for being some-;
thing, and that something recognizable for a man of unmistakable;
judgment-we can trust to choose the better and reject the worst.” . <
’ ■ This man of whom he speaks is the educated man in the true-
sense of the word. He is one who: feels and has learned to appreciate
good, both aesthetic and moral. He is different from the man who is.
often called educated—the man who knows many facts, can tell the:
dates of many battles, can sketch the lives of great men, and tell you;
what is the money value of masterpieces. This latter man is not edu-:
cated, even if he be graduated from the best of universities, unless he:
can also feel, unless he is a,man with a sympathetic soul, for the soul
makes man what he is.	.
The truly educated man, be he peasant-or king, has developed his
soul in its powers of apprehension. ! The other man: has developed but1
one part of his soul, the mate'rial part, the mind.	-	\
One has digested his knowledge by rumination and made it a
part of 'him. The other has gobbled down facts whole, and to. him,
'when he is honest, an editorial in the Podunk. Times is as moving as;
King Lear.	• .	:	.
The one has nurtured the seed of sympathy that is in him and the^
other has not. .	. ■
It does not matter, we might say in passing, whether the. seed be
fed by one or many sources of cultivation. A man may spend; his time
- on one book, say “Paradise Lost,” and if he can raise to the heights of
its arguments and- incorporate, all fitsbeauties in himself, he has ar-
rived at the. point of being highly, cultivated. “I fear the man of one
- book,” says the sage. *	. '	..	.-
The college has done its duty if it has planted this seed in a man’s
soul so that, if he is not now a man of aesthetic sympathy,, he. will,
if he continues to nurture the seed, someday be such a man..
Canada is drinkingjess hard liquor than usual. Ah, those, thrifty
Canadians.- -They don’t waste any thing, in. home .consumption that they

Children cry for the moon. Dogs
merely bay at it. The child is un-
happy because he cannot get it.
The dog, being incapable of happi-
ness,. only disturbs the neighbors.
It is a question whether the child
is wiser than the dog, but. we .have
more patience with the former. In
the matter of our wants we all fre-
quently .re-enter the realm of
childhood, infancy. We do not, it
is true; cry for the moon, but we
cry for things of far less brilliancy
and value. As the poet reminds
us: “We look before and after, and
pine for what is not. Our sincerest
laughter with some pain is fraught.”
—o-—	' .
What is gone is worthless. It
has no actuality. .It is and can be
only a memory. What is yet to
come is only a possibility. It may
be of infinate value in itself when'
possessed. But to pine for its ac-
tual possession now is to wail for
something more distant even than
the moon. Being more conversant
with the temper -of our neighbors
than babes in arms, we are, of
course, less demonstrative about it,
but we are not more consistent.
(No, gentle reader, to, pine ~for
heaven is not to hope for it. It"
is not necessarily loving God more;
it may be only shrinking under his
burdens because we do not carry
them with love.)	;
. . . ' .	--b— -
■Educationists -discuss- the'-value-of •
puzzle-solving as a means of de-
veloping power of thought. They
do: not agree upon its' importance.
Indeed, for that matter, they rare-
ly concur in any opinion. But none
can bewail the lack of puzzles. For
every thoughtful man is a constant
puzzle to himself,—even though
others maintain they are able to
“see through him.” Puzzle's are
complexities. But there is no great-
er complexity than man. Spirit is
difficult to understand. Matter is
still more unintelligible. Mingle the
two and you have a man, who is
therefore doubly unintelligible,
and consequently the greatest puz-
zle in the universe,—save woman.
Anyone that is able to solve the
puzzle that is" his own. adorable self
has developed his powers of reflec-
tion to a high pitch of perfection
indeed. If he has done this it will
be safe to say that he will have few
wants beyond । his actual needs.
,	—o—
“We are all slaves of bur- needs
[i. e., wants'],—the fewer they are,
the freer we are; the higher they
are, the - nobler the master we
serve.” Solving most puzzles brings
at best but a trancient satisfaction.
But solving the problem of self
brings understanding, and along
with that- the knowledge which
gives peace and power, and free-
dom. Rightly to control wants is
to be free. To be controlled by
them is slavery. A wise man knows
how and what to choose, and well-
regulated choice hinges upon well-
trained self-denial.
—o—
A certain preacher once said that
“the grand thing in life is to let
God have his own way.” . Converse-
ly, the most disastrous thing in life
is for a man always to have his
own way. In the former, case'wants
will be allowed to multiply only in
accordance ^ with rational nature.
In the latter, they will: multiply
themselves against all the laws of
nature. The: difference in result
is the . distance between freedom
and'servitude. -	—

Mah Jongg would never have become half so popular in this coun-
try, if it were not so much fun pronouncing it. • '
Ifthe United States rejects the Bok Peace Plan perhaps it'could
be sold to Mexico.
Not long ago an enterprising club,
at this University published a book;
of campus verse, and an extremely
creditable book it preyed to be..
Its pages were -filled with many
pretty rhymes and several rather
beautiful things, all of them as-,
tonisliingly well written. We who>
are not gifted in .the art may only;
admire and occasionally marvel.
..Now and then one meets with a
personality so vivid, so' uncon-
sciously artistic that one feels that!
here is a really poetic temperament
:—here is poetry realized in life-
something infinitely more interest-
ing than any; amount of rigidly con-
structed verse may ever be.
It is especially delightful to know
that here at Notre Dame we have at:
least one such a personality. At
the Holy Cross Convent there is an
aged sister who, despite the fact,
that she knows nothing of the for-:
mal composition of verse, has writ-
ten some really remarkable lines
which, in their simplicity and sin-,
cerity, have a real beauty that can-
not fail to impress itself upon the
reader*- Her verse is not written
for the effect it may produce, but is
merely the reflection -of her
thoughts of her father, of her be-
loved saints, and of the Church in
whose, service she' has spent over
fifty years. Her lines are to be
read with an eye to the sainted life
;—the 'beautiful personality—that
they unconsciously reflect,/and not
with the cold dissecting- eye of a
collegiate critic. A few of her
poems follow:	/	,
Requiescat .
’Neath the snowy, flakes so softly
. ^falling, /	;
< My father, sleeps in a lonely spot.
Sweet Christ, on thy tender pity
calling,' - •
Let each flake plead a Requiescat.
Lines to My Father . . '
I knelt beside a tombstone. ,
Flower-strewn the hallowed ground;
O father didst thou hear ,me
Close to thy daisied.mound?
Didst feel the fond tears falling
O’er thee I loved the best?
Didst hear. the grief-wrung plead-
v ing . •
That thou might find. sweet .resat?
And mother dear is sleeping
Where fern, and wild rose wave
The woodbine softly creeping
Above her ■ distant grave.'
What though-the way^be lonely
Afar, yon golden shore?
When waiting years are ended,
We’ll meet to part no more.
A Heart Wish -
May the dear Child . Jesus bless
thee, '	-
May His loving arms- caress thee!
May His Sacred Heart enfold thee,
His sweet peace and joy- uphold
thee!~
May his saving grace attend thee!
May the. smile of Mary Mother
Light thy pathway as none other; .
May her fond care thy shelter be—
This my unceasing prayer for
thee!- "

We have always regarded Charles
Chaplin somewhat as Lowell, re-
garded Poe: two-fifths of him gen-
ius and the rest sheer pastry. But
that was in the days when Charlie
wore a derby and a mustache, both
of which were peculiarly his own,
and carried a cane that had the
annoying habit of- bending when-
ever its owner needed its support.
Recently Mr. Chaplin abandoned
the cane and the custard pie in fa-
vor of the writer’s quill and the di-
rector’s megaphone, and gave us
«The Woman of Paris,” a produc-
tion that is as distinctly Chaplin as
were “Shoulder Arms” and “The
Kid.” ’
“The Woman of Paris” has been
hailed by critics as a work of art.
Whether or not it is is not for us
to decide but we join the majority
by saying that its writer and di-
rector is an artist. He has entered
a new and difficult field and has
shown the veterans in that field
how- things should be done. He
handles'all the scenes with an orig-
inality and finesse that the direc-
tors of the so-called spectacular,
productions have failed to approach.
He treats a difficult theme with the
same reticence that restrained him
from proclaming the cost of pro-
duction from the tower - of the
Woolworth Building. „
Mr. Chaplin, himself a man of
intelligence,.has given his,audience
credit for'the possession of some
traces of that quality and has wise-
ly refrained from diagraming ev-
erything in the subtitles. Every-
thing is done by suggestion. Con-
sequently “The Woman of Paris”
is-a moving picture and not a moral
or an immoral lecture,, illustrated
with a. few random scenes.
It is in his treatment of the hum-
orous element, a ,very small element
in this serious drama of the machi-
nations of fate, that the artistry of
Chaplin manifests itself. Comedy
is seldom introduced at the expense
of principals, the usual practice and
one that destroys any illusion of
reality that the picture may have
succeeded in creating.
Although Edna Purviarice is fea-
tured,, her work, while good, does

Editor of the DAILY: .
During the past few weeks sev-
eral individuals have taken it upon
themselves to attack the intellec-
tual quality of the student body on
the strength of the circulation fig-
ures of the University library pub-
lished some time ago. According
to these figures we are morons—
our intellectual stature as a body is
inferior to grade school standards,
and this to our shame and degreda-
tion. Someone has attempted to
explain these figures by saying that
they are due to the fact that the
majority of the students, instead of
taking the books from the library,
borrow them for a short time, and
read them in the building. The
lameness of this excuse is apparent
to anyone who makes an attempt at
observation. The figures are, I
think, an accurate record ’of just
to .what extent the library is used,
but they illustrate the inefficiency
of that institution rather than the
intellectual bent and the literary
preference of the student body. I
think I voice the opinion of the
average bookworm when I say that
my conception of a library, proper-
ly so called, is a place devoted to
books and bookish interests. I pre-
fer the South Bend public library,
therefore, because it more nearly
approaches this ideal than does the
University library. Immediately
upon crossing the threshold of the
down-town institution one is un-
mistakably aware that he is in a
house of books. He does not wan-
der around a barren lobby wonder-
ing if he is. in a potential art gal-

for shelves, and racks, and' tables
lery or a half-finished hall of state,
of books of divers dimensions and
colors assail him from every side
with the fact that he is in a library.
These'racks and shelves are not sit-
uated with any attempt to harmon-
ize with a rigorous architectural
scheme, but are placed around with
an air of genial informality ■which
it. seems must lend succulence to
even the dryest tome. It is in
such surroundings as these that the
book-lover likes to brouse around
studying titles and bindings and
taking down a book here and there
which catches his eye. Interest is
added by the classification of the
books. Here is a shelf labelled
“Fourteen Day Fiction,” one la-
belled “Sea Stories,” one of inter-
esting biographies, here is an al-
cove (small and cosy) containing
interesting technical books on law,
journalism, engineering, etc. No-
body, it seems, could be callous
enough to resist the appeal of books
thus good-naturedly forced upon
him any more than he can resist
his morning toast “just the color of
ripe wheat” and his “hot, golden
coffee.”
In the next room are three large
tables containing copies of current
issues of several score - of periodi-
cals. Around these tables are ar-
ranged comfortable chairs and here
one can sit and read .without sign-
ing a thing or putting anyone at
all to the inconvenience of ferret-
ing the magazine or magazines that
he wants in some obscure drawer in
a room closed to the public.
. The comparison • and the sugges-
tions implied are obvious. .They
require no further elucidation. In
conclusion I would say that more
new books on the shelves would
also boost the circulation. One does

CATHOLIC HI CLAIMS
CAGE CHAMPIONSHIP
Washington Basketbailers Have Un-
surpassed Record; N. D. May
Become Tourney Center.
For what is possibly the first time
in the history of Catholic high
school basketball in the state, the
the championship of Indiana has
been claimed by the Washington
High School. Although the crown
that the Washington team claims is
unofficial, its record surpasses that;
oi’ any other Catholic high school in j
the state.
In reaching its present position
as: the logocal title holders of the
1 state, the red and white quintet de-
feated the Gibault High of Vin-
cennes, the Cathedral of Indianapo-
lis, and the Jasper College aggre-
gation. Evansville Catholic de-
clined to schedule a contest, there-
by forfeiting any claim to the lau-
rels. Central Catholic of Fort
Wayne, the only other Catholic
high school in Indiana, also won
over the Cathedral, but by a smaller
recent years the sport enthusiasts
who have followed these teams have
strongly advocated such a league.
The Indiana Catholic through its
sport department has recently of-
fered a feasible plan that may be
adopted by the schools in the near
future. If such a plan were car-
r:
■ied out the tournaments might be
held at Notre Dame in imitation of
the plan usually followed by the
Indiana High School Athletic Asso-
ciation.

shots of the visitors. Egan at the
goal was the target of countless
shots which the Michigan puck art-

had accumulated on the top made
the handling of the puch anything

margin than did the downstaters,
and playing no other Catholic team
in the state. It is evident that the
claimants of the championship have
the best record of the' sextets that
compose Indiana’s Catholic schools.
During the present season the
Washington basketeers have estab-
lished a record that will probably
. remain in the southern part of the.
state several years. Of a schedule
of 20 contests with many of the
best ’ teams in the state, the
“shamps” lost but three and after-
wards revenged thees loses .with a
victory over each of the trio that
'won from the W. C. H. S. by a com-
fortable margin.
The two other first class Catho-
lic teams in the state, Central of
Fort Wayne and the Indianapolis
Cathedral, are well known to many
of the. student body, as these
schools have been a source of many
famous Notre Dame athletes in re-
cent years. Joe 'Harmon,: varsity
center of last year, and' Tom Ruck-
elshaus of the reserves are a few
of the graduates' of these schools
that are actively engaged in ath-
letics at the University.
As four of the schools are in the
southern part, one in the central,
and one in the northern section of
the state; a Catholic high school
league has been somewhat impractc
icable because of the limited re-
sources and the distance. But in

Ku Klux Klan Does Not Own
Valparaiso
Early in the fifty-first year of its
lifej Valparaiso University, situated
in Valparaiso, one of northern In-
diana’s beautiful cities, is taking
steps to correct the misinformation
sent out last summer that it was
about to be taken over by. the Ku
Klux Klan. A committee composed
of former students, the member-
ship of which is country-wide, is
being organized to carry this into
effect. On its stationery and in a
conspicuous place on every docu-
ment which the committee or the
University issues is printed “To
perpetuate Valparaiso University as
a great independent, impartial, non-
sectarian educational institution,
not privately owned, and allied with
no lodge, radical group or religious
denomination.”
Some time ago, wide circulation
was given to a statement to the ef-
fect that Valparaiso University was
about to be taken over by the Ku

to give back all the opium that they
had taken on board. This they did
and the opium was dumped over-

a number of ships and took five Of
the Chinese main ports. As a re-
suit of this the treaty of “Tin Sin”
was drawn up, which gave England
a right to trade and. carry on com-

at that time situated not far from
the Chinese port of Tin Sin, insisted
that the treaty give' the United

China, if they were to keep oh good ’
terms with America. The Chinese
government consented to this and
therefor America gained one of the
richest trade centers in the world.
America agreed at the time to do
