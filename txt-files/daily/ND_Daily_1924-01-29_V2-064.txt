Sundays putYne in the best of
humors—at least, Sunday evenings
with their- close companionship be-
fore warm grate-fires mellow my
heart towards the doings of my ir-
responsible friends.
-o- -o-
Now last night (at the time I am
writing) was a Sunday evening,
Snot “a typical.” .So look for the
kindliness in the gossip today. Just
W-. ..	,	‘
. '	- _0- -o-
This last Sunday was interesting,
; MOST interesting, but where I was,
and why, must remain the most
J secret of my mysteries. Some of
the brothers will understand.
-o- -o-
A word, permit me,- about “The
. Hunchback (N. D.).” Not as an
adv. but as a kindly hint, try not
to miss seeing it. I have a letter
1 which informs me that I must enter
, without delay (because he is a typ-
i ical well-dressed Notre Dame man)
i the name of Clopin “king of the
■ beggars” in my contest.
■-Or -O-
“Quaismodo also ran.”
i	-o- -o-
Which, alas, drags me back to my
duty and the contest. I had a
hunch back in Corby hall the other
: day that a monstrous conspiracy
: was- being prepared.. Seemingly,
the name of Moore stands for mar-
: tyr as much today as it did way-
' back-when, about 1535. For this
has come in:
-o- -o-
' “We, the undersigned, (the'let-
ter is dated January . 25, Corby
hall),, wish to cast our vote fbr
Wilfred E. Moore, believing hon-
estly that he is the best dressed
man on the campus. Through your
paper we notice.that you have many
, well-dressed men entered. in the.
contest^ but, being in close contact
with the said Mr. Moore and others^
we do .not hesitate to sign' our
name,, thus casting our. ballot for
! the above mentioned.” '

M’GUIRE WRITES
DRAMA CLUB PLAY
All-Notre Dame Production Is
Planned by Club; Cast Selected;
Rehearsals Begin Soon.
At a meeting of the Drama club
of Notre Dame, held in the library
last night, definite steps were 'tak-
en towards the production of an or-
iginal play which is being written
by Harry A. McGuire. The club’s
decision to produce a play by a
Notre Dame man was the result of
the enthusiastic sentiment ex-
pressed by students when the' plan
was suggested.	•
Presentation of' this play is
planned for Washington’s birthday,
and will be in harmony with the oc-
casion, the subject matter being
the Continental Congress. The
most dramatic point of the play is
the- decision'of the' states*to 'give~
over their individual sovereignty to
the federal government. ■	’
Of the sixteen characters in the
cast, twelve were selected at last
night’s meeting, and the remaining
four will be chosen within a week.
Those already named as characters
were measured for costumes,-which
will.be secured in Chicago.

CAHILL NAMES
BOXING TEAM
N. D. Boxers to Meet St. John
Military Academy Here
on February 4.
Frank Cahill, boxing instructor,
has announced the probable entries
for the Notre Dame boxing team in
the first intercollegiate meet of the
year with the St. John Military
Academy of- Manlius, New. York.
The date for the event, which will
be held in the University gymnas-
ium, will be Monday, February 4,
instead of Saturday, February 2,
the night of the Wabash-Notre
Dame basketball game, as was pre-
viously announced.
The tentative line-up • for the
Irish glove exponents follows:
Bantamweight, Danny McGowan;
lightweight, Mike O’Keefe, Jerry
Left or Jack Spillane; welterweight,
Maurice ^chell; middleweight, Art
Canney; light heavyweight, Charles
Springer, and heavyweight, “Butch”
DeVault. Every position on the
team has been practically settled
with the single exception of the
featherweight event. No competent
man has been secured to hold down
this position. Anyone who desires
to try out for this event, in the
118-125 pound class, is requested
to see the boxing instructor im-
mediately.
Two of the best boxers at the
University, Frank-Cahill ^and “Rip”
Miller, have been barred from the
contest by Coach Rockne. The
suspension is only for the St.
John’s meet and "will not prohibit
the men from participating in the
other - events of the year. Both
men are training with the team in
-preparation--^for- the’ state-- cham-.-
pionship boxing tournament to be
held in Indianapolis later in the
month -with representatives from all
leading colleges of Indiana. Cahill
and Miller were among the Notre
Dame entrants in the Tribune tour-
nament held.in Chicago last spring.
Notre Dame Graduate
Lectures to Engineers
Mr. Fred L. Baer, assistant chief
engineer of the Automatic Electric
Company of Chicago, and a former
graduate of Notre Dame, lectured
before the Notre Dame branch of
A. I. E. E. in . the south . room of
library Friday evening at 8 o’clock.
His talk was illustrated by two
reels of moving pictures entitled,
“The Dial of Destiny.” 1 \
He lectured Saturday imorhing
before the class in . telephony ’ on
“The Future of Telephony.” Later
he interviewed a.number of seniors
in regard to the telephony; industry
in Chicago and the opportunity for
position there after graduation.
Ten seniors will, go “to Chicago in
two weeks, at the expense of the
company, to examine the. plant.
Mr. Baer 'graduated from the
University in 1903, and was a class-
mate of Father Irving and Father
Burke. During his college years
he became very much interested in
automatic telephony, and spent a
number of his school vacations at
the factory of the Automatic Elec-
tric Company. He has been active-
ly connected with the company for
a number of years.
FROLIC TICKETS ON SALE
Tickets for the Freshman Frolic,
to be given in the Palais Royale on
February 29, were placed on sale
in the halls this morning. The
number of tickets has been limited
to 400. The price is $2. Members
of the Freshman class will be given
the first opportunity to buy the
tickets. .
According to John J. Reidy, pres-
ident of the .class, many surprises
and Leap Year novelties are being
planned for the Frolic, which is to
be the last Notre Dame dance be-
fore. Lent. .	' '
Postpone Meeting
of The Scribblers
The Scribblers meeting that was
scheduled for last night had to be
postponed because Father Charles
O’Donnell, who was to have deliv-
ered a talk on poetry, was suddenly
called away Saturday on important
business. The Scribblers immed-
iately wired to Chicago in an ef-
fort to get Lew Sarett, famous out-
door poet and lecturer, in Father
O’Donnell’s stead. He wired Mon-
day, however, that other engage-
ments prevented him from taking
advantage of The Scribblers’ invi-
tation.
Announcement of the next meet-
ing will be made soon.

DOPE UPSET IN
INTERHALL GAMES
Carroll and Day Still Tied for First;
Brownson and Cadillac
Show Class,
There were some unexpected
changes made in the interhall bas-
ketball standings when the five
scheduled games were played off in
the gymnasium Sunday. Carroll
and Day, who have led since the
first game of the season, strength-
ened their chances when they both,
defeated their opponents, giving
the two teams a perfect record of
three games won and none lost. The
Brownson and Cadillac teams, both
of which have occupied the cellar
position since the start, won their
games and are now tied with Sopho-
more, Badin, Freshman, Corby,
and Walsh, all having one victory
and two defeats. Sorin hall is rest-
ing in second place with two wins
and one defeat.
. Carroll and Corby started the
games when theymet at 9:30. Aft-
er getting off to a slow start the
Carroll ' eagers settled down to
their regular consistent playing
and registered'a 15 to 8 defeat'over
Corby. The combination of Dah-
man, Howard and McNally in pass-
ing and dribbling through their op-
ponents and the work of the for-
wards at) shooting baskets paved
the way for the victory. Kerwin of
the Carroll team’ was highfpoint
man with three field goals, while
Collins played a nice game for the
>sers on the defensive and shot
two baskets besides.
The Sorin tossers downed the net
performers from Sophomore to the
count of 18 to - 9_ . Harry. Stuhldre-
her, bf Sorin, was the outstanding
star of the game with five field
goals to his credit. With the score
14 to 2 at the end of the first half
in favor of Sorin, the Sophomore
shooters staged a rally, but failed
to overcome the lead ran up by the
.Sorinites during the first half, and
the game ended with Sorin nine
points in the lead.
The Cadillac loopers won their
first game of the season when they
beat the Badin hall netters in the
closest game of the day, as far as
scoring Ayas concerned, the final
count being 12 to 8. The Cadillac
men got off. to an early lead and al-
though pressed throughout the
game they were never behind.- The
first half ended in favor of Cadil-
lact, 8 to 6. They kept this lead
until the final point. The Cadillac
squad was ■without the services of
their star guard, Jim Gray, who was
married earlier in the week.

SERIOUS BUSINESS
.r The classroom “shark” and'the youth who has stayed close to his
books a few nights each week are envied individuals these days—the
days of examination. '	- < <	• x
Paid little attention during the course of the. semester, these young
fellows now -become much sought after. A popular campus gent, who
' has given most of his time to things of little consequence, comes rushing
into his. room requesting notes, asking information on this point or that,
and leaves the student with the shouted, word: “I’ll sit near you in
that class!”
Like the young salesman who has recently been invading campus
quarters with a booklet which offers “a course in philosophy for a
quarter,” these men try to'get a semester’s work in an hour of cram-
ming. They come to college to get an education, and then avoid all
serious work until face to face with the problem of passing or flunk-
ing out. •
It is an illustration of the lack of; business-like purpose among
college students as a’class. With a kind dad at home to see that the
checks are forthcoming regularly, a few hours: of class requirements
*. each day, and,a cgmfortable_niode: of life,, the. college man, with;but a
few exceptions, does not view'the serious side of life as does the chap
who has to buckle down in the world at an early age in order to make
things go. ■	.	■	'
In this the man who has never been through college has an ad-
vantage. JEIe has learned .that life is a serious business. The college
man, in most instances, has that to learn. That does not mean that
the college man should go around with a frown on his face and a pack
of , books under, his; arm, but it does mean that he should, give more at-
tention to business. A bit of system in studying would avoid the rush
at examination time. Spread the serious business oyer.the weeks, in-
stead of jamjning it all into an hour or two the night, before the exam.
Business-like habits will tlien be formed, and they will serve-you in
good stead when you hit that first job, whether-it is in a store or in
a shop, a law.office or the editorial room.

60% ofNotre Dame Students Earn Wages,
University Furnishes Employment to Many
- Approximately 60 per cent of
the• students now enrolled .in the
University are engaged in some
manner or fashion, in earning mon-
ey, according to the latest informa-
tion collected on the subject of em-
ployment at Notre Dame'.
\ From this fact. alone,. it is appar-
ent that the University is not an
institution for the idle.’ Neither is
it a university at which the spirit of
aristocracy reigns,, but rather bne
possessed^ of* men, who banded by
the .traditional ties of friendship,
have for . their: motto, as it/ were,
. the slogan of Hugo’s “Three Mus-
keteers”: “Alt for'one and one for
_ all.” . 7 ’
~ ; The factor most. responsible for
this prevalent spirit is provided di-
rectly by the ■ University. To the
student who comes to Notre Dame
bent on working his way --through
college, the University provides ev-
ery opportunity. He may accept a l
position- in the- employ of the ।
school as: secretary to a professor,
teacher at St. Edward’s hall; waiter
in a;refectory, stenographer, assis-
tant laboratory professor, student
prefect, quiz master or chauffeur.
Two-hundred- and • seventy stu-
dents have accepted work in the
capacities mentioned. The equiva-
lent. in-money, of work accom-
plished by each, ranges from $100
to $400 . yearly.. The; average
, amount made by this number is
THE TURNOVER
•Mr. Ernest Barker is an English
historian. Like every historian, and
all other sensible men, he values
the gift of. a good memory. But
he is the first historian whom we
have ever known to point out the
fact—if indeed it is a fact-r-“that
in. our modern civilization, with all
its apparatus, .we are debarred
from forgetting.” He fears ac-
cordingly that “the danger before
historians is that they should be-
come story-tellers of the infinite.”
He is concerned lest “the wise econ-
omy of the human mind, which has
forgotten the unessential” be ren-
dered impossible.
Both history and memory ob-
viously have to do with things of
the past. For as one cannot re-
cord what has never occurred, so
he cannot remember that which he
has never known. Confusion comes
when history in the making is-iden-
tified with mind in the making. If
that is done, then it'would not be
quite absurd to say that “it is only
an accident that we are not able to
remember the future.” For as the
mind; can—and does often enough
—construct a future, so it could
also construct a history, unmindful
of the past.. But that would be to
reduce the world of events to the
world of ideals, and .the serious
drawback , to this would be what
others might think, and the conse-
quent sacrifice of historical accur-
acy by reason of the introduction
of so many minds. It would be a
case of too many cooks spoiling the
soup. . .	'
It is doubtful < whether men ex-
pend more effort in trying to re-
member things than in trying to
forget them.' It is certain, how- j
ever, that there are many things
one must remember because he is
unable to forget them. But while
men cultivate the faculty of mem-
ory, they do-not, as a rule, exercise
themselves in the art of forgetting.
Perhaps it is because they assume
that such an art,' will take care of
itself^ This -is_a-mistake. -- During
the late-war the government saw
the. need of the selective draft in
order to obtain the highest quality
of. man-service.: But all during life |
there is an even greater necessity
of selective memory, or of discrim-
inating forgetfulness, in order to
insure the highest quality of mind-
service. No man is .ever quite use-
less, but there are many memories
that are utterly worthless. To re-
tain them is to clog the mind.
We share the opinion of many
diagnosticians of contemporary
mentality who claim that what ails
modern minds is that they are over-
loaded. They are not too empty,
but too full; not too idle, but tod
busy; not so unretentive that they
have nothing to occupy themselves ,
with, but so over-retentive that ।
they cannot decide
attention to. So,
geese, they become
than pugnacious.
would seem to be a

few - lessons in
forgetting. It
if intellectual
progress is to* be made, that Xis one
can subject memory, so also can he
subject forgetting to a large
amount of voluntary control.
Of course all this may be quite
unpsychological. For even psy-
chology (theoretical at least) some-
times runs contrary to experience.
In this matter it should be consol-

What seems t'o us most worthy
of remembering and of putting to
practical use is the professor’s
suggestion about the . “-wise econ-
omy of', the human mind” whereby
it habituates itself in the forget-
ting of the unessential.. This cer-
tainly can be done. For memory,
in most instances, depends upon
voluntary attention, voluntary repe-
tition of given experiences and the
formation of clever associations of
images and ideas; One can . solve
-the -problem -of forgetting.-non-es-
sentials by-confining his attention
to essentials. • But, of course, this
will necessitate going through life
with one’s eyes open. ' .

For those who.would like to know
something about Einstein’s, theory
of Relativity, -Charles Lane Poor,
professor of Celestial Mechanics at
Columbia University, has brought
out a clear and concise exposition
of the subject' under the title
“Gravitation versus Relativity.” ;
The findings of Einstein are put in l;
direct' opposition to the theories of '
Newton. Professor Poor is inclin- •
ed to discredit much of the theory
of relativity' and' accepts Newton
almost in his entirety.. The book is
written in .such a way as to be eas- -
ily understood by the lay mind, .
and is .practically the first to ex-
press the Einstein, theory in terms
that the laity can .understand. ; -

Unless you’re one of those per-
sons who would walk a. mile for a
Camel, you won’t cut anything im-
portant to see the show at the Pal-
ace this week. Perhaps we h^Ve
' been spoiled by the exceptional pro-
grams of the last few weeks, but to
our mind this week’s bill is below
par. ..
Houdini, who is the principal at-
traction, has an act that mystifies
and entertains. Although only two
tricks are performed, they are quite
sufficient to furnish the cash cus-
' tomers.with food for thought.
, And still the run on snake
dances continues. This week it’s
charming Eleanor Pierce who per-
forms, and she does it quite cred-
itably. ■ We must say, however;
that the act is little more than fair,
our partiality to Miss Pierce not-
withstanding.	'	.
“Pianist, stick to your Stein-
way!” This is the humble advice
we would venture to Emil Demar-
est, who. proves to be a fine pianist
and a poor comedian. The act is
fairly good.
Hayden and , Atwood are. pretty
weak. There’s really nothing much
to. recommend this one save—-well,
. they’re clean, anyway. '	. .
' Kirk and Collier open the show
• with, a wire walking, act. They do
a few clever stunts and show some
originality, which covers a multi-
- tude of sins.	,
The picture is called “Jealous
Husbands” and it’s featured by the
extraordinary performance of two
child actors. The .picture is im-
probable but interesting.

rental that the exhib-
pay. There is no evi-
this practice in “The
of Notre Dame.” The
sets are elaborate, but they are a
necessary part of the picture. We
have been told that the production
is authentic in detail; it seems that
even authenticity has its price.
As every one knows, the story is
adapted from Victor Hugo’s novel,
“Notre Dame of Paris.” To the
credit of the producers it should be
said that all the :objectional fea-
tures of the novel were lost in the
process of adaptation.
Lon Chaney’s portrayal of the
half-crazed Quasimodo is as fine a
piece of acting as we have ever
seen on the screen. He is to be
congratulated upon his make-up. In
the supporting cast Patsy Ruth Mil-
ler, Norman Kerry, and Ernest
Torrence give satisfactory per-
formances.
The producers have made an. at-
tempt to relieve the depressing ef-
fect of the picture by the injection
of humorous incidents. At times
this change from the tragic to the
humorous is so sudden that it de-
tracts, too much from the intended
effect of the picture. This / hot-
altogether successful attempt at
Falstaffism is our only quarrel with
a picture that is well worth seeing.

Editor of the DAILY:	■
It strikes me that C2K uses very
bad taste in using the DAILY as a
medium for his suggestions to-the
Senior class. If he is a senior why
not make the class meeting serve
this purpose? Does he lack the
courage. If he is not a senior, why
not Jet the Senior class handle its
own affairs?
His suggestion that the class
wear blue and gold caps and have
pinch-back or English cut gowns
leads one to think that the chief
purpose of his article was to see
it in. print.
He also seems to have an aver-
sion toward the men from the East.
How many of the pinch-back suits
has C2K seen on the campus this
year .worn by easterners. I admit
in our large cities in the East that
element can be found, but I have
not seen any absence of it in our
great western cities. As to the
English 'cut, this style has been in
vogue in the East for some years,
and the mere fact it has not as yet
reached the West is. surely no re-
flection on the East.
When C2K gathers a few real
facts about the conditions in the
East I shall be glad to hear from
‘him.~: ~~ ----- ----- -= —

Irish Are Looking Forward to
Creighton Battles and
Other Games.
The Irish eagers will begin train-
ing at the “Y” for the next big at-
traction of the basketball program
with the Wabash College five, to be
played one week from tonight, Feb-
ruary 5.
The Maylmen gave ample proof
' of their ability to return to top
form'in the Aggie game last week,
and with an additional week of
practice before, the encounter with
Crawfordsville. C o a c,h Keogan
will undoubtedly: be able to' put a
fast stepping quintet on-the floor.
- 'The performance of Enright in
the Aggie scrimmage indicates that
the Irish will: have a more highly
perfected offensive game for the
coming tilts,- which will- include a
game with Indiana, return games
with • Wabash and Franklin and a
two-game series with the fast
Creighton outfit.	■
Besides the return game with
Franklin, the two-game card with
the Hilltoppers at Creighton will
undoubtedly be the hardest contests
that still await the Maylmen. The
westerners have perfected basket-
ball along scientific lines arid their
victories over Indiana, Iowa and
the Haskell Indians go a long way
towards proving their ability.. -
The Hoosier conflict was the sea-
son opener and the Hliltop men
- went into the game not overly con-
fident, but having once started,
they dazzled the visitors with ev-
erything "they had.
The Iowa , five came next and the
* Hilltoppers were. confident despite
the fact that Iowa had a veteran
team, part holder with Wisconsin
of the 1923 conference title. The
Creightonians went irito the game
, cool and alert. They trimmed the
Hawkeyes, 36-13. They presented
a masterful defense and a more
wonderful offense, and the spirit of
their winnings will have_them play-
• ing in top form when the Irish five
' stop off at Omaha.February 22-23.
■ A 48-Hour Sport Review
The formal opening of. the
Olympic games, which occurred
with the winter sports of Chamonix,
was marked with the superiority of
the Finns and Norwegians over the
American entrants in the skating
races. The northern teams took
every point in the 1,500 and 10,000
meter races. All the Americans
had was gameness, but were unable
to overcome the terrific pace set by
the sturdy. bronze giants of the
north country, whose speed and en-
durance were remarkable. Time
for the events was 2:02 4-5 and
18:04 4-5 respectively. The point
standing follows: Finland, 48 1-2;
Norway, 39'1-2; United States, 11;
Sweden, 1.

Upset. The conference basketball
dope sheet was -ruined by the out-
come of the games during the past
week. Michigan let the Gophers
down by the margin of one point,
32-31. Chicago stepped out and
smothered the leadership of the
Badgers by beating them 35-17.
During the week past the Ohio
State five took the measure of the
Iowa crew, although not crawling
up very high on ’ the percentage
sheet. ’ Chicago will take, on Iowa
next Saturday, and a win will put
the Maroons on even footing with
the Wolverines for the Big. Ten
vor of the off-campus team. The
winning team had ability to hit the
basket at regular ^intervals, while
the team from Walsh failed to play
up to their previous performances.
The Day team got off to an early
start and had the game their way
from start to finish.
The Walsh men were not so bad
bn the defense, but failed to form
any kind of an attack when they
got their hands on the ball. . The
entire Day-Dog .team looked good;
Cullinane and John Hurley played
well for Walsh.
The stellar work of Jack Downs,
Day-Dodger guard, was largely re-
sponsible for the holding of Walsh
hall to such a meager score.
What proved to be one’ of the
best games on the schedule Sunday
was the battle between the Fresh-
man and Brownson loopers, the
team from Brownson winning, 20
to 15. Both teams were slow to
register a basket, but after the
game was well under way a real
battle resulted. During the first-
half the Brownson throwers col-
lected five free throws and two
field goals for a total of nine points
while the Freshman team were
close behind with a total of seven.
Bro.wnson lengthened her lead at
the start -of the second half by
shooting three baskets in quick
succession and was never in real
danger of losing the contest..
The fourth series of games will
be played next Sunday.
