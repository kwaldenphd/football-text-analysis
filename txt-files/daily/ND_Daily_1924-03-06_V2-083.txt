Reflect a moment (as you read
this in your Eight O’Clock) on the
expressiveness of poetry. For, of
• all things underfoot, this first entry
in the “Versus What” contest has
touched on a most appealing sub;
ject It is entitled:	'.
After the Rain
“Splash!
Many a pool of water I know!
I know where the campus is wet—
Do you? •	'
' I know where there’s water, and it
Isn’t dew.	(
I know a puddle where a boy fell

PENANCE IS URGED
ON STUDENT BODY
Fasting Not Necessary if Some
Other Penitental Act Be Per-
formed, They Are Told.
; • “Remember thou art dust, and to
dust thou shalt return,” is the key-
note to the spirit of Lent, sounded
by the Rev. Charles C. Miltner, C.
S. C., in a short discourse preced-
ing the distribution of the ashes
and the celebration of solemn high
mass, yesterday morning in the
Church of. Our Lady of the Sacred
Heart.	(	'
। The spirit of Lent, and the’ ob-
servances which that jieriod de-
mands were set forth by Father
Miltner. Fasting, he said, was:jiot
absolutely riecessary;- foY tKe:7 stu-
dent,(Tjut some act or acts .of "satis-
faction significant of penance for
past offenses, should be practiced. ;
; Father; Miltner, who was the cele7
brant at the mass, was. assisted by
the Rev. Thomas Steiner, C. S. C.,
deacon, and the Rev. Bernard, Lang,
C. S. , C., subdeacon. The Rev.

ing held, in the ; library Friday
evening. John Dore was elected
vice-president and , Albert Doyle,
treasurer. .	.: .	'
■ Plays to be given by the club in
the near future were discussed at
this meeting. It is probable that
the (Drama club will'present three
one-act plays. The plays will be
written and offered for production
by The Scribblers. “The Servant
in the House” was suggested as a
desirable play. 7 . /	; /
Dante Club Hears
FatherMiltner
Father Miltner gave a short and
interesting talk to the members .of
the Dante; club, at their last meet-
ing, in’the North room of the li-
brary. .	'	-
He, pointed out from Dante’s'life
and works three qualities: , First,
faith in ■ God; second,' complete
knowledge of all . subjects; third,
art that implies truth,- beauty and
expression. It was these three
qualities that have attached many
readers to Dante. .	'
. The members voted in favor of
having a lecture at every meeting.

For,Holly wood, CaL

wood, California.	( : .
Coach Rockne announced yester-
day that Walsh withdrew from the
University by order of his ;physic-
ian. Walsh will return in June for
the summer, school term. :	,
The withdrawal of Walsh just be-
fore' the Wisconsin meet will be a
serious loss to the track team. He
was a leading point ■winner, in the
hurdles and the shot put. He was
also expected to ! throw the discus
during the outdoor season.
SUPPER CLUB MEETS j
At a meeting, of the Supper club
held. yesterday noon for the pur-
pose of electing two new members,

new names for the club were dis-
cussed; ’ This matter was shelved
until the next meeting.
BADGERS BRINGING
FAST TRACK MEN
Layden and Barr Will Toe Line
'	With Fast Man in
McAndrews.
The appearance of Wisconsin on
the local gym for a dual meet with
the Notre Dame track team Satur-
day at 2:30 will mark the close of
the Irish indoor season.	.
All advance dope indicates that
the Badger outfit, is^exceptionally
strong and well-balanced.	-
The Badgers have a fast sprinter
in McAndrews, who clipped the 40-
yard dash against lowo in :04 2-5,
but he will meet a pair of speed
merchants when he toes the mark
with Layden and Barr, the latter
having already turned in a :04 2-:5.
dash for the local gym, equaling
the record set by Wasson in 1910.
The 440-yard run in the Iowa
meet was turned in at :54 flat, but
McTierrian of the Irish' squad
equalled the gym record this win-
ter when he raced home in :52 1-5.
The high' jump and pole vault are
strong features on the Badger pro-
gram, Hammann and Jones have
been turning in. vaults of 12 feet,
6 inches. Paul Harrington should
break close, if not with a win, after,
making a 12-foot leap in the Illi-
nois Carnival.
The Badger entrants are as fol-
lows:	.	>	'

HELP! HELP!
The DAILY is doing everything within its /power to gather all
the. news at Notre Dame, and to report it correctly. Now it,makes
this plea/for assistance. And the assistance .it asks for’is this : . If the
' officials of any organization, or the officials in the departments of the
University, have news of their activity about which they have not been
interviewed'by a reporter, we would appreciate it if they -would either
send us that information1 or send us word that they will give out the
infbrihation if it. is called for. . i •	.
Every member of the reportorial staff is assigned a beat of likely
news sources, which he is supposed:to cover not less than three times
a week.. But the reporter may not be successful in finding you; and
too often when he does find you he is dismissed with a bored, “Nope;
don’t know a thing.” If you know of no news, try to give the reporter
a tip as to where he may find some ; and if you can’t give him that, you
. can atleast encourage him nr his thankless quest. . .	' ,
. Many organizations have publicity managers. These men. can aid
' their clubs very much, and at the same time facilitate our gathering; of
. news—bearing in mind/of course, ;that we seek, not “propaganda,”
. but news of genuine interest.	*	.	. . . /	. .
' Some rnen upon the campus have proved'their, spirit of coopcra-
' tion beyon$ a doubt. They have sent in stories of their own writing,
at times when it looked to the news editor as though only a miracle
could produce a particular story. And you may rest assured that such
a predicament is not a novel one. An .instance of . such a dilemma, and
of its consequence, is offered by the istory of Mr. Coggeshall’s ’ecture,
published in last Saturday’s DAILY. The reporter assigned to the
story became ill. Ten p.m. passed without his appearance at the.
printer’s with the story. At that tinie the men on duty began phoning
in a last effort to get a report of the story. Three of (them alternated
at the phone between ten o’clock and midnight. Information was re-
• fused by men who could have given it; others told what little they knew,
f or didn’t know. So at midnight the “information” was pieced together
and the incorrect story was the unconscious result. . .	.
The DAILY men do not want to have to be sleuths in their
quest for news. So if you see a timid little piece of news hiding its
. face in a deserted corner, won’t you please pinch its nose and tell it
’ to run over to the basement of Walsh hall? Or} if you want to see some
action, just let one of the DAILY’S freshman dynamos know where
" . it is hiding,, and then wait a few minutes and watch that little piece of
news, come.scurrying-.into the DAILY office for shelter.	'	. 1
Dear Editor:	. .	•
“Since parking my grip at good
old Notre .Dame I have come to be-
lieve that under the Dome is bred
a splendid race of “he-riien,” ai
. group that worships neither clothes;
nor money, neither fads nor faces?
On the whole my fondest dreams
have surely been borne out—this
is NOT a school of snobs; this Is
NOT-a school of sriibbers; This; IS
a school of big-hearted “he-men,”
who don’t give a continental if a
man looks graceful drooped over a
davenport; neither do they twiddle
over a Broods Model or a Langrock
Lounger.”	;
; The foregoing .is an exerpt from
my letter which' appeared in ' the
DAILY recently. It is necessary to
repeat for the sake of a few ans-
wers to the DAILY questionnaire
and R. E. F. One man said that I
coritradicted myself all the ' way
through,—he -evidently does not
know what the Principle of Contra-
diction is. Another man did not
answer the question. He . said
something or other about a story
that probably ihade. every: one won-
der where the connection was. :
R., E. F. made a; very poor refu-
tation. in the last :issue. He ram-
bled on in such a circumlocution-
ary way that it reflected on the al-
logical way in which he thinks.
R.. E. F. - was' also very, tautologi-
cal. His; extemporaneous expatia-
tions, unpremeditated descantlings
and jejune babblement show bom-
bast and unintelligibility.: Any one
can use big words, R. E. F., it’s the
thought; Even I. can use them oc-
casionally.1 : ■ '	, : ,	.
There, is a .little ambiguity' with
regard to the men of whom I
speak. . I.-expressed myself'clearly
in my last letter and the class of
men whom I directed my attack
against. . I imean the fellows that
spend several hours each day, or
nearly every day, lounging around J
-SAINTTHOMAS AQUINAS
: . Six hundred and fifty years have elapsed’since the most saintly of
scholars and;the most scholarly of saints, expired in Fossa-Nuoya; yet
the esteem in-which lie was- field at tfiat time- lias ;not diminished, but
rather has increased steadily with the- passage of-years. The observ-
ance of the.sixth centenary of his canonization last, fall found his name
more honored and his influence-more thoroughly appreciated than ever
before. So' it is most fitting that the philosophers of Notre Dame
should set1 apart the seventh of March, the anniversary of his death, to
. acknowledge'the'debtwhich they owe to the Chief of the Scholastics.
' Even .. Saint: Thoinas/was . not granted perfectiori ,without un-
usual effort on his part. IfThe wras a singularly blessed genius he was
no less an'-ihdefatigable worker. His whole life was filled with study-
ingj preaching} teaching, writing, and praying;' He was tireless in his
ardent zeal for the explanation and'defense of the Christian'truth.
. Neither did he labor for any earthly reward., \He begged to be
excused from accepting the Archbishopric of Naples, to which' he’was
appointed by. Clement IV in 1,265. Had he accepted .this appointment,
most, probably the “Summa Theologica,” the work which immortalized
its author, would not have been written.	...
. And at Naples iri 1273, after he had completed’liis treatise on the
Eucharist,"three of his brethren saw hiin lifted in ecstasy and heard
a voice proceeding from the crucifix on the. 'altar, saying “Thou hast
written well of me, ■ Thomas; what reward wilt thou have ?” Thomas
replied:'“None other than Thyself, Lord;” -	;
In Saint Thomas the rarest gifts of. intellect wrire 'found, with-the
tenderest piety. . Prayer, he said, had. taught.'him more’ than study}
, So it.has been said,of hini that he labored as.if: all depended upon him-
‘ self, while he prayed as if all'depended upon God.' And it is in this
, last respect that students may, regard Saint Thomas as a model most
worthy oL emulation.- :	’	.	.,	> *

The Tartan, organ of Carnegie
Tech, has the following, to say of a
bit of verse that was contributed to
“The. Ink Well.”	'
Here’s a little poem published in
the Notre, Dame DAILY:
- .	.	, Inconstancy,,
A star fell in love with, a flower,
Arid shone with a, softening ray,
Telling his love .with a depth and
power ‘	\	,
He’d learned through the whole
long day. ' :	:,
But the flower was tiny and white
. and small . .	.
: And she wasn’t so sure of the
star at all.
So nodding her head in her own
; . sweet way -
She premised to tell him at break
. of day. ' .	.
Morning came and the flower was
■ sure, .	'
Her. love grew strong with, the
dawn, .	.
She lifted her head all shining and
. .pure, -. ■ -	"	.	<
But the star had faded and gone.
Did you ever see: anything as
good around here? Neither did we.
They seem to put out something
besides, football players-out in In-
diana. *
Surely in all the students we have
someone- who can write as well as
this boy. Then why don’t they?
the hotel lobbies, arid who have
their phone1 calls placed at their
“permanent” address, the hotel
lobby.	. :	'
Everyone uses the hotel lobby to
good advantage. It is the logical
place to meet your sister, father,
friendj—-but not to waste several
hours a‘ day playing the “parlor
reptile?’ :	:	' G. k;

Notre Dame Scholastic-—Some
young riian who managed to eke
into the list • of editors of. the
Scholastic, jingled the sordid coins
a kindly father had just sent him,
elevated his proboscis to the proper
angle, arid wrote an editorial for
the December issue, “For The Abo-
lition of The Time-Clock,” in which
he ’ attacked student employment..
The same day this issue reached us
the NOTRE DAMEz DAILY fea-
,tured on its front page the fact
that “forty per cent of the stu- ’
dents are working their way
through' the university in whole or
in part.” The. ' Scholastic was
spoiled by this snobbish pen. Oth-
erwise, the issue is. up-to standard,
which 'means excellent.—Exchange

' Should there be any institution
similar to the Louvre, for master
productions of the screen, • “Scara-
piouche” would demand a position
pfhighest honor and great conspic-
uoiisness, so that in accordance with
I its merit, it might have , its proper
measure of admiration.
We have often attended these
plays that were described as “sen-
sations,” but, strangely enough, we
have never experienced that elusive
feeling until we viewed this latest
effort of Mr. Rex Ingram. In addi-
tion to this “sensation” (which is
difficult to describe) we had a pleas-.
ant feeling that we were wise to
have gone, and that a tribute had
been paid to our individual taste
and intelligence.
(Should you happen to be 'ac-
.quainted with the romantic adven-L
hires of Rafael. Sabatini, it is un-1
necessary for us to say that they 1
are entertaining in the extreme,
and if ^ou have followed the indi-
vidual, careers of Alice Terry, Lew-
is (Stone, and Ramon Novarro, you
will know that they are capable of
carrying a play of this type to a
point that will satisfy the most ex-
acting dramatic Epicurean.
Mr. Navarro, as Andre-Louis Mo-
reau, is warmly praised by Sidney (
The Varsity Basketball Squad, Which Plays Wittenberg Tonight, and Gloses a Successful Season with the Franklin Game Saturday Night.


Blackmer, the Scaramouche -of the
stage presentation, for his exact-
ness in the interpretation of Sabat-
ini’s character’ Andre isa. boyish
philosopher, a Hamlet forced to re-
venge by his heart, which is full of
love for humanity.
Alice Terry, as Aline de Kercar
didu, is the fascinating aristocrat
of; the court of Louis XVI, and
Lewis Stone portrays the cruel, gay,
anH"witty Marquis la Tour d-Azyr,
whose scornful disregard -of * the
rights of man is equalled only by
his total disregard of personal dan-
ger. Both these characters are de-
lightful.
, peorge Siegmann, who took the
part of the brutal merry-go-round
keeper in “Merry-Go-Round,” is
Danton,. the pock-marked revolu-
tionist. He bears an . uncanny re-
semblance to original pictures of
the .real Danton, and there can be
no criticism of;his work. -
| The first scene of this picture
I banishes indifference on the part of
the*audience, and compels an. over-
whelming interest, /which lasts
throughout the picture. It is a play
of heroes, and even the villainous
Marquis invites admiration for his
bravery, and compels it by his noble
end. .	'	I
“Scaramduche” was filmed on a
lavish scale. Over ten thousand
people were used, and all the sets
were especially constructed for this
picture.-.;
The. play shines conspicuously
among the other productions of the
year, and has been warmly praised
by the most exacting reviewers. We
hope that our whisper of approba-
—Courtesy of ‘‘The Alumnus”-
tion, added to this universal shout'
of approval, may induce you to see
this thing, which we earnestly be-
lieve should not be missed.—P.Q.M.

mistic attitude as the season opens.
