Here is a letter ! wrote myself:
Mr. Edward Huether,
Permit'me to thank you for the
kind words you uttered concerning
“Campus By-Paths” (twelve point
: caps', please, Frank) when inter-
viewed by the perspiring inquirer.
You said, among other things, that
it was “a ‘------- good column.” I
appreciate .your sentiment, but de-
plore the expression. You should
have said, “My dear sir, permit me
to assure you that “Campus’ By-
Paths” is a joy-forever. It is the
sine qua non and ne plus ultra, not
to mention the carte blanche and
. the a posteriori of the Daily.” You
see, in this way, you would not only
have given me a great deal of pleas-
ure, but would have given an im-
pression of erudition most edify-
ing to your former' English teach-
ers. You should never use a dash
to modify a substantive; it is al-
most as bad as using the masculine
-participle to modify the pluperfect
Chemists Experiment
With Radio at Meeting
The features of the Chemists
club’s meeting last night, held by
the Junior class, were a paper on
the preparation of sodium by the
electrolysis or fused sodium'hydrox-
ide, by George Ludwig; an expla-
natiori of the apparatus which was
constructed by B. J. Flock and ex-
plained by Clarence Kiser; arid a
radio lecture on “Chemical Analy-
sis and Analytic Chemistry.” The
members present were quite aston-
ished when they. heard the sweet
strains of the Swedish banjo and a
deep voice announced . station
B-U-N-K, Stockholm. The select
audience of Notre Dame scientists
waited with bated breath while the.
voice declared that Professor Eu-
gene Willihnganz would no deliver
the lecture of the evening. And as
announced, Mr. Willihnganz, from
the second floor of Chemistry hall,
via telephone, attacked to a radio
magnavoXj.gave the regular, lecture
which he had prepared.

Professor Paul Fenlon, newly ap-

Mr. Fenlon said that that what was
needed was more co-operation. • He
also stated that he had always been
interested in the DAILY, but now_
’'because - o'f'UiTs~bffi6'i^
with it he would take a greater in-

He also said that if some of the stu-

criticism instead of .sitting back and
knocking, they would be of greater

LaSalle County Club
Dance Well Attended
The LaSalle County club held an
informal dance on Christmas night
at the Knights-of Columbus club-
house in Ottawa, Illinois. A ca-
pacity crowd enjoyed the party.
Bob ’ Bradley’s orchestra traveled
over from Chicago to furnish the
music. The dance was a complete
success both from the social and
financial standpoint.
Holiday Activities
End With Toledo Hop
CKristriias holiday activities were
terminated in Toledo when the To-
ledo-Notre 'Dame club gave its 'an-
nual formal dinner at the Woman’s
building on the evening of January
2. The dance drew a larger crowd
than ariy other of the season, and
was a success, both financially and
socially.
The ladies were presented with
pounded silver ’ compact cases that
were; embossed with a silver Notre
Dame, monogram.. And the gentle-
meri . received black leather bill-
folds that were engraved Mth the
Toledo club seal and the individual’s
name. A blue leather program
made in the form of a wrist-watch
was another novelty of the affair.
• Harry Denny and his Notre Dame
Old Man Winter Here
and Gone----Maybe
Sheepskins were’ forgotten and
galoshes flapped about their owner’s
ankles as Notre Dame enjoyed a
delayed Christmas present from the
weather’ man. Yesterday with the
temperature well over the freezing
point trackmen and students jostled
democratically about the campus
while the gymnasium and halls were
practically deserted. .	1
Only one small group refused to
recognize the benefits, accruing to
them from such .weather.' Skating
over water covered ice, their clubs
sending up a spray at every swing,
the hockey candidates held grimly
to their practice.
But as we write this it begins to
sprinkle. From the. northwest a
slightly chilled breeze is blowing.
Tomorrow we may be plodding
knee-deep through the snow drifts
and scampering hurriedly from hall
to hall in a blinding blizzard; or
again, we -may be swimming to and
from classes in the deluged paths;
and too, we may be basking in the
sunlight of a January thaw. Who
can tell?.

SPUTTERERS AND STEADY LIGHTS
This is a good time, of year to take stock. A lot of merchants are
■doing it,-and now that resolutions are as rare as the dodo bird, taking
stock'often helps one to check up on a lot of little things without going
tojthe trouble of making a resolution. ,	■ -
''A good many here at Notre Dame will find" that they are handling-
more stock than they can sell profitably. These are the men who'dabble
- in activities. There are such at Notre Dame. Eager to boost every-
thing, they often become too enthusiastic, and pile clubs on top of
publications, and then add two layers of incidental activities for good
•measure. They-are usually good men—sometimes the activities are
forced upon them—but they are handling too much, stock.. They don’t
get a chance to make a good sale because they are worrying about some
other-order. They are sputterers—and sputters never brought a ship
in safely—it’s the light-house, the steady light, that does that; Robin-
son Crusoe never would have got off his island if he had tried to build a
ship, aeroplane, submarine and dog-sled at the same time. v He stuck
to the raft and got away with it!
Check up! Put your activities.in front of you, cut-them in half,
■ select three from the remainder, wrap yourself up in their armor and
;$^T^esisfi?'teniptation.''^*"Ydu'‘wilP cut your stock,-but-'you- will ^sell 1 more;.
You will have more time to make a.’sale, and the buyer will have more
- confidence in you. ,	>	-
THE MYSTERY OF OPPORTUNITY
What is opportunity?
You will often hear a student, comfortably located in some campus
retreat, make the statement that “he hasn’t had a chance’’ to do any-
thing at Notre Dame. He will speak'in envious fashion of some lad
. who has gained campus attention, and attribute that youth’s position to
what is known in undergraduate life as “a drag.” Yet in the secret
recesses of his heart, the same student, will be wishing that he was. in
the shoes of the other.	x \	-
He bemoans the fact that he hasn’t had the “opportunity” to make
himself as prominent in campus activities as his classmate. He has
confessed to a weakness. He has admitted inferiority. - He has quit.
For man makes a majority of his opportunities himself. No one
comes along and thrusts success, like, the quarterly exams, upon him.
A man is a success because he dared to try, because he risked failure
r and conquered it. Few successes have ever been made without some
failure. '	'.	_ '
The door of opportunity swings open to each sunrise, and, there is
ample time for every lad at Notre Dame to distinguish himself in some
way. The centralization of activities in a few men is due to the lack of
initiative among/the rest. That is not a good thing for the leaders, for
the university, or for anyone.' The old phrase—“Too many cooks spoil
the’broth,” does not apply where distinction may be gained in such a
variety of pursuits.
If you have had no opportunities in the past, help-,the future along
by making yourself some. Choose your line, whether it be in athletics
or in literaturcj in politics or in studies. Then become acquainted with
every one interested in that line—the leaders of today. Let these
friendships yield to you experience, strive hard and persevere, and you
will become one of the leaders of tomorrow.
WHERE PREPARATION BEGINS
- “Young man, you are attending college to prepare for life.” We
have heard this statement many times but, perhaps, have not paused
to. consider how false and illogical it is. If we have not it is nothing
to our discredit for the statement is hardly worth pondering over long.
If we are merely preparing for life now, and actual existence is,
for us, somewhere in the misty future, what is this we are living now?
Are we in some sort of an embryonic stage from which we will emerge
later as beings capable of life, capable of the appreciation of life?
We are entities, in spite of this statement implying the contrary,
with careers existing not in the future solely but in the present as well.
We are preparing,-yes, but our grandfathers are-preparing, too, if they
are alive, so the “preparation” part of our existence -is a characteristic
that identifies us as human beings and not as collegians; ' .
Knowledge lumps on a man’s head often signifies that he has ex-
perienced some hard blows. ' ' .	:
It looks as . though the Bok Peace Award may creat a war in
Congress.	.	.	.	,
THE TURNOVER
“The best thing about good res-
olutions,” says a local editor, “is
that one can always piece the brok-
en parts together.” The philoso-
phy, of this remark would seem to
be that Being, in any shape, is bet-
ter than ’ non-Being. Therefore—
to conclude in true philosophical
form—it is better to make a good
resolution and have the parts left
with which to rig it up again, than
to consign .the parts to oblivion be-
fore they have had a chance to get
into the first edition.

Editor.	I
Of course cantankerous people
will contend that a resolution whose
shattered parts must needs be
pieced together could not have been
a good resolution at all. Such dis-
putatious persons are to be found
—found oftener disputing the feas-
ibility of making . good resolutions
than making such resolutions them-
selves. About the best resolution
which they could make would be to'
leave off discussing whether it is a
good thing to make any, and to
make some. For though undoubt-
edly they are folk with good inten-
tions, endless discussion about car-
rying out their intentions makes
such intentions stationary, and
these, like the two equally attrac-
tive bundles of hay between which
the unfortunate donkey starved to
death, lead to moral stagnation.
. Marcus Aurelius says: “Take
the short cut; and that is the nat-
ural one.” It seems that the ad-
vice of this old Roman moralist has
never been followed with greater
alacrity than in our own day.
Though our scientists and inventors
have provided us with a multitude
of time and labor-saving devices,
short cut, we seem on the whole to
have to work harder and to have
less time at our free disposal than
any of pur forebears who had to
take the longer course. Yet why
wonder? Professor Holt tells us
that “the whole world is chock full
of contradictions,”—though it is
evident that the professor’s own
ideas are quite’ prominent in this
topsy-turvy plenum.
• We have our “Wallingfords,” our
Wells, our Thomsons, our Drink-
waters, who have applied this short-
cut philosophy respectively to get-
ting rich, to history, to science and
to literature. ' We have our com-
pilations. and compendiums, our
summulas 'and synthesis, our ele-
ments and digests, our codexes and
hand-books. Then, too, there are
surveys and statistics and graphs
and briefs and syllabi. In fact, we
are quite besieged with short cuts
to truth in every department of
knowledge.	"	I

To deny that any resolution can
be good because it may eventually
be broken is like insisting that a
pair of boots are worthless because
they will eventually wear out. Mak-
ers of resolutions, like makers of
boots, can guarantee a certain
amount of service for their product.
And this' ought to be a sufficient
test of their value. They cannot
guarantee them against never wear-
ing but or needing to be repaired,
and that for . the very simple rea-
son that they, .are made of corrupt-
ible materials,’ A mere compound-
ing of -parts-doCs-not-alter nature.
It is as humari’lb make resolutions
as it is to make boots. But resolu-
tions, are more necessary to human
welfare than are boots. For while
the disaster consequent upon, the ne-
glect of boots is nothing more than
tough or torn feet, the disaster con-
sequent upon the neglect of good
resolutions is tough characters and
torn hearts. .	.
We have not heard though of
anyone reaching the goal of perfect
wisdom by traveling these abbrevi-
ated highways. Indeed some edu-
cators, after years of experience,
frankly and flatly declare that as
a nation we are not only uncultured,
but not even on the road to cul-
ture; not only not in possession of

The New Year is traditionally, if
not proverbially, a good time to
make resolutions, .and a time to
make good resolutions. And we
hazard the theory- that as “it is
better to do a little thing right
than a great thing wrong,” so it is
beter to resolve to do a good thing
even for a time than not. to resolve
to give up the bad thing at all. Per-
haps, if- we include ourselves in the
general change, it may not. be re-
sented if’we say that all of us
have a few bad things to give up.
Unless one is perfect—-which few
"will claim to be—he can become
better. And as “no one ever be-
came learned by looking wise,” so
no one ever became virtuous .by
looking innocent.	.
’ We agree with Aurelius that the
short cut is “the natural one.” Na-
ture, or at least human nature,—
how trite this is—loves the- line of
least resistance, loves ease, loves
speed. A short cut is supposed to
produce the same results as a long
course, but minus most of its dif-
[ Acuities and all of its .waste of time
and energy. But though a “natural
act” is generally good, it need not
by any means be the best. Other-
wise formal education would be not
only futile, but also farcical. In
this matter it is well to be old fash-
ioned and to admit that the longest
way around, is the . shortest way
across.	<

Professor Macy says that “With-
out faith of some sortjthere is no
restfulness in anything.” The best
foundation for a good resolution is
faith in itself. Faith, is not a leap
in the dark. It is belief supported
by solid motives, even though these
motives are extrinsic to the propo-
sition believed. To resolve is to
will to do something. And the will
to do, must be somehow grounded
on the belief in the ability to’, do.
And to believe that you can do
something is not necessarily pre-
sumptuous because it happens that
you have never done it before. For
half of the “can do” is enveloped
in the “will to do.” The other half ।
may be a gamble, may involve a
risk. But that is precisely, what
gives it attractiveness, lends zest to
the enterprise of winning it. If
men only had more enthusiasm for
the things of the spirit/ making
good resolutions — and mending
them if necessary—would soon be-
come their chief recreation. There
is more fun in trying to become
better than in merely sighing be-
cause you’re not. .
wants but half a loaf? And so
short cuts; like life-savers, are to
be used ''rather in cases of emer-
gency than in the ordinary contin-
gencies of life.
Of course, since “short” and - -
“long” are purely relative, it may
.often be a question as to which is
a short cut to a given goal. .What -
is called a short cut be may merely,
the right road, and the long course,
long merely because of useless de-
tours. T^ere is no absolute long,
nor no absolute short, just as there
is no . absolute .hot. or cold. Still
there is extravagance and waste, an
1 irreducible minimum,— and besides,
there is good judgment and fine dis-
। crimination. Let these fix the boun-
I daries between short and long, too

Editor’s Note: Here are two re-
views of “Zaza”; we print them
both because the two critics differ
widely in their judgment. Take
your pick.
At the LaSalle
On the other hand, “Zaza” is a
picture which gives the dramatic
critic keen delight. With much of
the same diabolical manner with
which a surgeon lays out his in-
struments before giving ether, the
critic arranges his most stinging
phrases and. prepares for an enjoy-
able evening.
“Zaza,” according to the intro-
duction inserted by the director, has
been a favorite play of famous
' dramatic artists. It is a well-
known fact that-favorites of the
turf have a habit of ending in the
“also ran” class when ridden by
poor jockeys. The “jockeys” in
this version of the play sink a plot
with’ marvelous dramatic possibili-
ties into a disgusting series of
scenes of alleged dramatic tension.
Gloria Swanson’s interpretation
of an impulsive favorite of the
French musical stage-—with ges-
tures—has a noticeable taint of the
Ghetto, that is, the gestures remind
one of the phrase, “make it two-
ninety-eight and I’ll take it.” We
cannot but wonder how Gloria won
France by her singing when she
never opened her mouth wider than
was necessary to permit her cynical
laugh. We were led to suspect that
she is the proud possessor of a set
of false teeth and feared that they
would fall into the lap of the thea-
tre-goers instead of her slippers, if
she burst into song.
H. B. Warner as the passionate
-lover-leads-us?to-believe that-‘Snoo-
kie,” the wonder ape, would make
a success in “Romeo and Juliet.”
As a chorus we might say that as
an actress, singer and pianist Gloria
makes a wonderful hosiery man-
equin.	W. J. T.
.	At the LaSalle
Until “Zaza,” Gloria ^Swanson
had in our mind, been synonymous
with Mae Murray. ‘ That is a ter-
rible thing to say about her, but she
deserved it.
Now all in changed. In “Zaza”
Gloria Swanson finds a role that
was made for her alone, and she
plays it as' few others could have
done. She rips and rages, tears and
tumbles to her wild heart’s content,
until she falls in love. As you
might expect, but scarcely do, she
passes through all the stages from
a lioness to a lamb and back again.
Her acting is fiery, passionate—she
wiggles better than Mae Murray,
she lights playful fires in her eyes
that are brighter than Nazimova’s,
she is more terrific in love than
Pola Negri; and more dignified in
love than Clara Kimball Young.
H. B. Warner is so brazen as to
play the love-making without- jump-
ing over fences and smashing rac-
ing cars. : It is refreshing to see a
lover who is human, who’ shows in-
telligence as well as> passion in his
eyes. He is really too classic, too
restrained, for this modern day;
if Shakespeare were living he.
would doubtless write a new kind
of play around Warner.
Anyway, if Doug Fairbanks were
as good an actor as H. B. Warner,
he might not have to spend a mil-
lion'dollars to draw the public to a
picture.-* > ' ‘	•
The plot of “Zaza”—the, same
story that Farrar and Duse and
others have sung, only modernized
—is so simple as to be tense. Dra-
matic power, strong emotion that
is in such good taste thag scarcely
a character’s , tear-duct is opened,
and top-notch acting makes this a
peach of a picture.

The Editor, . .
The NOTRE DAME DAILY:
There has been some comment by
students in regard to-the adoption
of a University mascot. We have
been reminded of mascots adopted
by other universities—rthe Califor-
nia Bear, the Princeton Tiger, the
Harvard Chow-dog, the Army Mule,
and others. Hence the question,
“Should the Notre Dame .football
team have a mascot?” And if so,
what kind of an animal should be
adopted?
The Student Activities Committee
invites expression from the student
body on this question.	.
Sincerely,
G. A. BISCHOFF,
Secretray.
Editor of The DAILY.
Dear Sir:
Last fall when the student mana-
ger, James Swift, spent .three whole
afternoons at the gymnasium giv-
ing out the best reserved, seats on
the east stand to Notre Dame stu-
dents, about three hundred students
failed to get their seats and later
on, in the rush and hurry of the big
game, made a constant nuisance , of
themselves up in my office and did
a lot of talking around in the halls
about their rights.	.
At several, of the baseball games
when it was found that a lot of our
students were loaning their tickets
to people of South Bend while they
themselves got in on their face, we
then made a strict rule that no stu-
dent was to be admitted without his
ticket. We again heard a lot of
talk from this same small group
about their rights. . .
Last Saturday night at the Mich-
igan game, although they had been
warned by the -press about being
over early*as there were but 1200
seats,*yet^about 8 o’clock, as the
game was about to start, this same
he might discover a weakness on
which he could throw his stock of
vindictive and caustic adjectives.
Failing in this, he either ignores the
work or pronounces it fair.
We have always maintained that,
if we ever had the good fortune to
witness a performance that did not
portray a previous existence in
Babylon or a society revel in which
the gentlemen roisterers looked
like waiters and needed haircuts,
we would depart from the usual no-
tion of a critic and peruse the dic-
tionary for synonyms of praise.
This, however, is not the only merit
of “Anna Christie.” Remarkable
acting by a well-chosen cast makes
—but as we have not received a
reply from our letter to Eugene
O’Neil asking him for his opinion
of the play, we stopped , at that. .

small group of a couple hundred
strolled in and wondered why there
were no reserved seats ready for
them.	.	/
A little co-operation on the part
of these privileged characters would
go a long way toward easing up a
difficult situation. There is room
for 1200 only at the Y. M. C. A.
gymnasium, and from now on after
10 minutes to 8 no one will be ad-
mitted, because the basketball teams
will be on the floor practicing and
then the game ■will start, and it is
not fair to the teams on the floor
to have these privileged characters
come stalking in, interfering with
the practice and with the game.

night a controversy arose about our
favorite subject: The DAILY. We
all want to see some new feature
that has not been tried before, some
novel column, or anything that
would attract attention and inter-
est. One suggested a poetry con-
test, another a short story contest,
and I a funny paper. We -could
get a quorum on none; but the
three of us agreed on this: What
about a “most handsome man in the
school” 'contest? This has been-
tried .out in other places and has
met with great success; for exam-
ple I saw, not long ago, a portrait
of the most handsome man at Dart-
mouth—that is, he was’voted so by
the student body. Now if we could
find amongst us a youngjkdonis we
would have all the artists in the
country seeking our. chosen as a
subject. Why not try it?

confident of their theatrical ability
and they made good. Floyd John-
son had an equal amount- of confi-
dence but. it brought him to the
verge of pugilistic ruin. Fred Ful-
ton suffered a fate almost identical
to that of Johnson and maybe sev-
eral other aspirants to fame in the
roped,arena could be named in the
same category. '
Johnson had but a smattering of
the stuff that put Leonard and
Dempsey in the calcium glare. The
same applies to Fulton, but both
men discovered that they forgot to
THINK, that what they must do
first is to get the fundamentals and
then step in and take the honors
that - .would naturally accrue to
them.	। '	J
Johnson and Fulton are to be
made over into potential heavy-
weights and if Luis Firpo should
ever take the title down South,
perhaps America will have'a pair of
reborn ghosts to go down and get
it back.
Johnson and Fulton have great
possibilities as heavyweights. They
presumed, so it appears to cavorte
in the roped arena with only the
primary lessons of ‘the game
learned, and. backed their, courage
with a powerful punch that' was
wasted on the scientific glove weild-
ers that they stacked up against.
Both men have awakened to this
realization and have gone back to
school rather than continue in their
present capacity and be pounded to
death by men of their own class
who’ knew the game.
Maybe we can apply this case to
the American college student, and
heydoesn’t want to, come back to
' school in after life, he’ll pack his*
best punch now.

Unless Temperature Drops. Lake-
Rink May Be Unfit for Practice;
Bleachers To Be Erected.
With preparations for the Notre
Dame hockey season going forward
at a rapid pace, the Irish sextet,
anticipating the . opening clash of'
the schedule with the Michigan
team'at Ann Arbor next Saturday,
are now facing the problem of no
ice and the curtailment of practice
sessions. The warm weather fol-
lowing the intense cold speel has
been the cause of much worry in
Notre Dariie hockey circles, since
the ice on the lake is rapidly trans-
forming into water again.
The hockey rink which the man-
agers decided to build on the lake
this year because of the unstable
condition of the ground laid rink
between Badin and Walsh, which
has been the scene of the hockey
games since the organization of the
club, has been alniost completed-,
and following the building of the
side boards a. temporary bleachers
will be set up on the north shore
of the lake, to accommodate the
spectators of the winter sport.
Nearly every year in - the past,
the Michigan school has been able
to boast of a fast, clever sextet,
but when they met. the Irish team
and the inimitable . Paul Castner,
the Wolverines have been unable to
cope with the masterful work of
the Hoosier stick artists. But with-
out the services of Castner, Lieb,
Flinn and the other men who have
made hockey at Notre Dame, the
outcome ' of Saturday’s encounter
will depend bn the spirit and fight-
ing qualities of the several new
men who are filling the ranks of
the gratuated veterans.
Nearly every., candidate for the
1924 hockey team is a player of
proved worth and undoubtedly the
brijliant record _of. past years will
be sustained. ' ' ■
