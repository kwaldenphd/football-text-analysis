NOTRE DAME READY
FOR ILLINOIS MEET
GJLLMEN TO APPEAR ON CAR-
TIER FIELD TODAY; OBERST
TO BE SEEN IN ACTION.
A Notre Dame victory over- the
championship Illinois track team on
Cartier Field this afternoon is not
the’ most probable thing on the
1924 track schedule. The brilliant
aggregation of tracksters from the,
Urbana school coached by the in-
imitable Harry Gill has a host lof
elegant track material which has
been the sensation of middle west-
ern /track circles for several year's.
However their appearance here this
afternoon will be made more than
interesting by several members of
Notre Dame’s track team who‘have
won for themselves the plaudits of
the midwest track critics.
, Illinois has, engaged in 51 dual
meets since 1904, when-Harry Gill
began his coaching regime and
only 14'.meets have been"lost and
two tied in that time. Seven times,
the Gillmen have copped the. indoor
and outdoor conference title and
after their notable performances
during the iridoor season, the cri-
ticshaye doped them to repeat on
the outdoor card at Stagg field
next June.	. .
The feature event on the program
will be the javelin throw with;
Oberst: of Notre Dame and Angiers
and Schildhauer of Illinois provid-)
ing. the . competition! While this
event will- attract great interest in-
asmuch' as two title holders
arid one near;title holder will com-
pete for; supremacy,- it will not, far
over-shadow--.the. .dash., events and

RUN FOR DOME POSITION; Me
ELROY IS SELECTED AS
' ART EDITOR.
At the best attended meeting of
the year, the sophomores yesterday
nominated candidates for the Dome
staff , next year. Dennis J. O’Neil,
a: member of the Scribblets, and
Jay Fleming, who has been connect-,
ed with the Daily for the past.two
years, were chosen as candidates '
for the position of edi£or-in-chief.
Lester. Hegele,' a. student in the
college of commerce, and Mabrice
McNulty, of Brownson hall, were
selected as candidates for business'
manager. Wilbur McElroy, who
. has- been active in Juggler work was
.nominate
editor, and refused the -nomination,
but - was . prevailed upon to accept
for the benefit of the .class. 1
Jack Scallan, editor-in-chief of
this year’s Dome and John Bartley,
the business iriariager, spoke before
the election, advising the class to
choose men who were capable of
handling the work. On -Monday at
12:30, the' final election for the
staff will be held and all sophomores
are urged to attend.. . ‘	.
On Monday, evening, at eight
o’clock, in Washington Hall, Mr.
Reynolds of the public speaking de-
partment, will read the four act
comedy drama, “A Tailor Made
Mari,” by Henry James Smith.
' The “Tailor ’ Made Man” was
first produced in America by Co-
han and Harris at their theatre in
New York, in 1917. The first writ-
ing, a definite adaption of the Hun-
garian original, was done during
the winter of 1916-17. The. follow-
ing summer it was rewritten ’ with
much greater freedom, and in the
following winter after the road pro-
duction, when Grant Mitchell'made
his marvelous characterization of
John Paul Bart, it was rewritten,
again, this time with the dynainic
help of George M. -Cohan. .
Mr. Reynolds give a’fine rendi-
tion of the play. He has, read it
with great success in many colleges
and cities throughout the South and
the East. He is a graduate of the
Leland Powers school of expression,
and for the past four years has been
associated with the Federal and
Affiliated Lyceum Bureaus through-
out the country, as a play reader.
His technique and his theory of
reading is based on the principles
and philosophical laws taught. by
Leland Powers.
Professor Reynolds will: also
read at St.-.Mary’s Sunday..night. .
Excuse Senior Classes
4 During Ball Week
week is pronounced one of his best;
It shows the troubles of Lloyd as a
tailor’s apprentice who is afraid of
women. He makes a secret and in-
tensive study of them during his
free time in the garret of his home.
He writes a book of his experiences
। and tries to; sell it. The story of
how he conqueres his shyness and
wins the girl he loves is humorous
and interesting. The last two reels
are by far the most exciting that
have-ever been screened and Harold
is found riding on everything from
a trolley car! to a team of horses to
save the girl he loves!	,

. The ; dog was presented’ to the
Notre Dame athletic association by
the Toledo club and Mr.. Edward
Lynch, a former, member of the
varsity football team. Before the
dog was given, to the university, the
need of a mascot was acute; All the
other colleges in the United States
have their, mascot supposed to, re-
present in some manner the charac-
ter. of the. school. Terry was given
to the school because it was felt
that one of .his breed was the best
standard bearer, that we could'pps-
sibly have./'	■’. )■
Terry with his inquisitive snout
and his twinkling'eyes'won instant
favor among, the -students and the
faculty. The only complaint that
could have been made was that he
inspired too much’ fondling; He
was a visitor everywhere on the
campus, and, there was no place too
sacred for the little animal. He
visited both the; cafeteria and the re-
fectory at the lunch hour and many
an instructor will •• testify as to how,
j office of the great) were nothing in
the'life of the dog as .he. made sev->
eral visits to the president and the
other officials., He was . coristantly
in the halls/and even saw the pic-
tures, in Washington hall/ \
| Terry, .was always ready to frolic
with anyone that came along.
His .frolics. are now'\ pnded.
He took a walk last Tuesday with
। two students and the trail led to the
Niles road; He could not be sent
back when he once reached'the road
[but -followed, the students. . They
! saved him several’ times from the
1 wheels of cars but he could not be
(restrained when seeing a Nebraska
license he rushed madly at the ap-
proaching car and it passed over
his body. He was treated by a vet-
erinarian, but internal injuries were
not noticed;
For the next two days he tried to
be his usual self. He replied; to
every call and he submitted to every
pettirig, but Rock at last; noticed
that, the beast , was hurt and .took
him to. another- vet. This man’ saw
the trouble but too late to save the
life of the mascot/ /	./ :
So' died ’ the first mascot of the
fighting Irish. .. >.	? . .
■ Wabash took advantage of every
hit and every misplay by Notre
Dame yesterday and won an inter-
esting game of baseball, 10 to 6.
Notre Dame threatened to win sev-
eral times, but; long flies, rollers,
and- pop-flies enped. each rally too
soon. Errors by. Quinlan opened
the; game, and gave Wabash the
-Confidnnep/and runs .that. led, fn vi0=.
tory.. The game showed that Wa-,
bash has again developed a .team
that can play baseball, and play it
well. •	'	' \	'
'' Robertson/ who pitched ’ for the
Crawfordsville nine, was hit hard,
but the support of his teammates
enabled him to get out of ’ many
holes.'He was unsteady and-found
the plate seldom'but he had some
stuff on the ball, and he never lost
his head.'Dwyer, on the contrary,
began in misfortune and although
he was not hit hard in the first inn-
ings, he worked so hard. that; Wa^
bash got to hi pi in the fifth for sev-
eral hits, one .home run, and :a walk,
and the result was that Coach Keo-,
gan sent in McGrath. Wabash both-
ered McGrath- for four walks and
three hits until the ninth, when
Magevney began to pitch, and put
Wabash to rout for one lone inn-
ing./ ... ■ ;	,
[ After two men had got ori first
due to errors, L. Wyatt, hit a two-
base hit, Roll hit a three- base;hit,
and Englehart: singled, making four
runs, for Wabash in the first inning. .
In the fifth, a home run. by L. Wyatt
scored F.' Wyatt, who ‘ had brought
ill Burdette and Dale, on base by a
single and a walk. A base on balls,
a: sacrifice, and a hit by , T.
Wyatt made another run in -the
next inning, and after two. men
were out, a single by L. Wyatt, a
stolen base, and a single by; Roll,
made^another run.	’	■
t More than two hundred couple
. attended the Junior prom at the
Palais Royale , last night; The) hall
was decorated to represent a jap-
; anese rose garden, with pagoda
like entrances to the floor and jap-
anese lanterns strung from the ceil-
, ing to the walls. This decoration
was the result of many hours work
on' the part of the decoration com-
mittee and amply repayed their ef-
' forts.
' The Grand march was Ted by •
John Moran, Miss Dorothy Harris,/
Gilbert Schaefer and Miss Genevive
Mortensen; • The fact that everyone
joined in helped to make it a suc-
cess. Jean Goldkette’s orchestra'
more than lived up to its reputation
and steady applause greeted' the)
end of each,number. Those unable
to attend the Prom were afforded
an opportunity to enjoy Goldkette’s' !
music through WGAZ, w h i c-h
broadcasted the program from ele-
ven'to twelve o’clock.	' .
. Favors for the ladies were a
black and gold vanity; case, bearing
an N. D. monogram. For the men^
was a leather - memorandum ' book
embossed, with . monogram and the
class; numerals. Attractive pro- »
grains were also ’furnished.	'

_______;_______ . J
A student recently made the
statement that, with the exception
of “Tom Playfair,” he knew of no
good Catholic books. He was ap-
parently sincere, but he was cer-
tainly unthinking. He was perhaps,
of the opinion that in ord^r to be
Catholic a book must be essential-
ly religious, whereas it is necessary
that the book be Catholic . in its
point of view, in its principles, and
in its way of looking at life.
One of the most notable con-
tributions of Catholic authors in
the United States is the “Robert
Kimberly” of Frank Spearman,
book which treats of one of the mos;
vital questions, of the day, that of
divorce, from a Catholic-and sane
viewpoint. Mr. Spearman does not
specialize in theology, but his story
is told with dramatic power and the
Jieology is there- nevertheless, al-
though he does not commit the
fatal error of turning his novel into
a tract. It is an antidote to the ef-
fusions of Sherwood Anderson and.
W. L. Georgei ;	■	'
Mrs. Wilfred Ward did some-
thing of the same sort years ago,
but on a much' more ambitious
scale, with'her “One Poor Scruple,”
whichj-while • it-deals-witlf'the’same'
subject, is tinctured with a survey
of the modern woman. Her latest
book, “Not Known Here,” is the
story of a man of German, parent-,
age who is living in England dur-
ing the war. His ostracism, ’ and
the way in which he worked out
his salvation is told with a note of
idealism' which can be found in no
other volume of'recent years.
; :	THE NEW TAMMANY LEADER ■
Al Smith, son of New York’s east side, graduate of Fulton’s fish
market, as he. once proudly announced to the New York state legisla-
ture, twice governor of the Empire state, and* presidential possibility,
is inevitably the mew chief of Tammany hall, the world’s most influcn-'
tial political machine.	,
, His ascendency cannot be gainsaid,; for. he is by all odds the most
powerful democrat in his, state., He surpasses Murphy, his dead leader,
in that he has as large and faithful a following up-state, now an area
not to be despised, as he has in his native city. , Party politician though
--- : hcis,lichas-the-utmostrcspect-ofevery-rigllt7niindedcitizcn of" every’
' 'party, however widely apart they may be on public issues.
Though out of the campaign as a possible candidate, he will never-
theless wield great influence in naming his party’s candidate for na-
tional honors. If his record may be taken as a criterion, the nation may
expect a more powerful Tammany in 1928 than it has ever known be-

• TILDEN AND CATASTROPHE
The forced withdrawal of William T..Tilden II, America’s foremost
tennis player, from amateur competition deals a severe Blow to the
chances of the American tennis team.
If Tilden can rightfully be termed a professional on the grounds
that he was writing his ideas .for the press, then “Chick” Evans and
numbers of amateur^ golfers,, football players, and other sportsmen’can
also be caught up in the same net of technicality. .
It is truly, unfortunate that Tilden or any other sportsman who
classes hiinself within the amateur sphere'may be forbidden to .be a
writer as well as. a ranking. player. 1 :	\
The offer of the Briarcliff club to accept Tilden as a professional
at a salary in comparison to his skill carries with it, also the.hope of the
900 members, that he will be able do beat the sinister elements in-the
world of sport which have combined, either through malice' or. short-
sightedness, to exclude him from amateur competition. .
Tilden/by reason of his accomplishments and journalistic ability,
is truly the Walter Camp of the tennis world; Kill his spirit in amateuV
competition and something precisely essential and energizing is with-
drawn from the sport; ;	<	;•	'
DOME ELECTIONS.
The Sophomore class met in the Library yesterday, nominated men
for the offices, of editor-in-chief and business manager, and\elected a
man for art editor. On Monday they will meet again to choose the
other two men. that will put over the university’s annual.' -	’
The Dome is-possibly the most important publication bn the cam-
pus with the. modest'exception, of course, of THE DAILY.. The
sophomores must exercise great care in selecting the men who will have
charge of the book, the annual record of a year of college life, one that
goes out to homes in every state of the union^ and to homes in many
' other countries, too. Many people judge Notre Dame by. the annual,
and only a book that is as good as the best is representative .of the Uni-
versity. Already a capable art editor has'been selected, and it is ex-
pccted that the sophomores will exercise as much care in the selection
of the other two men—the editor-in-chief and the business manager. <
. .. The,juniors of this year did well. By their selection, they have
'insured-what will be, without qualification, the best annual the univer-
sity has .'ever’had. This'is not said because of the-result of present
. enthusiasm, but is believed to be mature judgement. It. is only right
- that the book should Jae called better with each year, for the university,
too, is growing in importance and prominence. \ ■ ’ , '
• ' For the men of this year, the sophomores..will/we feel sure, select
••/men who are not.only capable and talented in their work," but also men
7 'who can secure the full cooperation of their fellows.
Follyology, a monthly magazine
published at St. Paul, Minnesota
Because the American peopk
have developed an unsatiable appe-
tite for excitement, the magazine
game is now a paying business. One
of the “excitement’’ magazines, one
। that has a regular menu of one
thing, sex with plenty of. tabset
sauce, now has the biggest circuit
tionof any American magazine. All
of the newspapers of the kind that
print eight and twelve pages of
comics every Sunday, with their'pa-
prico section of shallow and sordid
bunk, highly colored and embellish-
ed, have the greatest circulation in
America. Humor and shallow sa-
tire are having their own, ^and the
American people are living on a
queer diet.
But all of this is an’incentive to
young men with some gift for flashy
writing, with much education and
little wisdom. Out in Minnesota,
already famous for Main street,
they have begun to publish one of

- “Enchanted Aisles,” by Alexan-
der Woollcott, Putnm’s, New York
$2.50.
After reading “Enchanted Aisles”
one finds himself of the opinion
that, one of the chief advantages de-
rived from holding the position of
play reviewer on the New York
Herald is that one comes in contact
with everybody who is' anybody,
to use a homely expreession in the
theatrical world.
Mr. Woollcott; one of America’s
Uoremost dramatic critics is an essay-
ist of 'far more than average ability,
and recently he tried his hand at
acting, a dangerous thing for any
critic to do. The facts in the case
are that Mrs. Fiske was giving a
benefit in which a number of per-
sonages were taking part, and Mr.
Woollcott was selected to play King
Henry VIII, much to the delight of
his fellows who, no doubt, enjoyed
the performance much more than
he did.
vel.. A long review on “Flaming
Youth” is clever, but it is of’the
kind that would tempt morons to
read the book. The last paragraph
of that article written to deride the
book, is a mere dud, .after the
whistling shrapnel of. an entire
page. The other articles are also
clever, in some cases, entertaining^
but none of them are substantial.
Even a Main street sense of
The. book, Mr. Woollcott’s sec-
ond, is divided into “Enthusiasms”
and “Resentments.” Among his en-
thusiasms are the late Signora Duse,
Charlie Chaplin, zJohn Drew, Pro-
fessor Copeland of Harvard, and
last, but by no means least, Maude
Adams. Under the title of “An
Open Leter to a Lady,” he express-
es the admiration of the American
play-going public for the. woman
who immortalized Barrie’s “Peter
Pan.”,
art should keep one from such atro-
cities as appear in the makeup of
the book. In one of their editorials,
the editors apologize for the cover,
but an infinity of. editorials could
not make amends for the general
' makeup of a magazine intended to
attract the youth of a ' country
which has some sense of art, even
if it may be mistaken in many other
things.- The cuts are poor, and the
artists are not the ones the maga-
zine should have. Congressman J.
M. Baer is a good cartoonist—for
a newspaper—but he is not the man
to do work far a magazine with a
name like “Follyology.”
It may live—but if it does, “Fol-
lyology” must travel albng some-
what. wiser, paths.~ 'HrTWr 'Fr- '
a
Then, the most casual survey of I
Catholic books^—and this does, not
presume to be even that—-would be
incomplete without John Ayscough’s
“San Celestino” which is .the life
of a saint with the touches of hu-.
manity too often lacking in books
of its kind.	' ,
The belief that there are ho Ca-
One 'of . the enthusiasms with
which it is -most easy to agree is his
essay on John Drew who recently
completed his fiftieth year on the
stage. Mr. Drew, of course, received
letters from hundreds of people,
congratulating, him bn his career.
By far the most unique message
was a bit of rosemary with a card,,
bearing the line, “There’s rose-
mary; that’s for remembrance, dear
Uncle Jasper.” There was no' signa-
ture, but it was from Maude Adams.
Only, she could, have sent it as a re-
membrance of the days when they
played together in “Rosemary.”
Mr. Woollcott,. howeyer,- does^not.
confine himself to his own field en-
tirely. He has-an essay or two based
on his experiences in France, Neysa
McMein is the subject of a'glowing
tribute, Mr. Tarkington and Steph-
en Crane come in for their share
of praise, and George Ade is re-
quested. to -write a play entitled
“1897’,’ recalling the. fashions of
that day, in the manner of “Mary
the Third.” ■
There have been books written by
critics which are.far'more scholarly
than “Enchanted .Aisles,” but Mr.
Woollcott’s purpose is not to be
dogmatic but entertaining. His
. anecdotes are the result' of years of
asssociation with stage people and
his more serious moments rise from
a love and clear understanding of
the theatre.
tholic authors of note in modern
times is so naive as to approach
J. S. B

Crowley, who flew but to Englehart.
