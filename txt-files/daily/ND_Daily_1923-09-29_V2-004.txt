DOME GILDING
TO FINISH SOON
Powerful Reflectors to Cast Light on
Statue of Our Lady; Gilded
• Last in 1912.
The work of gilding the dome,
which began on September 5,
should be finished about October
10/ and a ’noteworthy feature of
the improvements m'ade will be the
illumination which will be cast on
the statue. at night by a series of
lights,, aided by powerful reflectors.
.. The lights which -will be placed
at the1 base of the 16 foot,statue
will throw their beams to a-set of
reflectors around the’ statue' head
and within the new aluminum halo,
flooding, the entire- statue with
light.”
\ In the" refinishing job, the statue
and dome were first scraped of all
sediment, • and.; then . -were coated
with a solution of rust-proof paint.
Added to this were three * coats . of
flat-oil. .paint which constitutes the
base' for the gold leaf, which will
cover the Some anS - statue ■ of Our
Lady. ■' -’s'	.. a
• The value of the gold leaf used
is -about-. $2,500, and . the amount
of the contract,. which, was awarded
to Joseph Wolf and Son, of South
Bend, is $6,000, it is said. . .?/. r
The /dome was last gilded in the
falL.of 1912. If it were not for
the northeast winds which drive the
smoke and soot from the boiler-
room chimney directly across the
dome and which deface.it, the: dome
would-not have to be refinished
more- than' once in twenty years.
? In; 1879 the construction- of the
dome was begun and . it was .not
finished until 1884, being modeled
after-.the . dome of the Invalides in
Paris. . '	..	. . , ’ .
” Towering 200 fdet in tHe air, the
dome can be seen for miles7 ardund,
and it " is - always the' subject for
much discussion, among, the. tourists
on the highways that radiate from
South Bend. -	"	-
It was the wish of Rev. Edward.
Sorin, /the "founder: of the- Univer-,
sity and the\mari.\vho:conc^eiyed^
idea of • the - dome; ’ that - Our Lady
should look oyer the,whole' of Notre
Dame. True -to kis wish the dome
and statue, will ever remain, the
most characteristic thing at the
University, sacred to the men of:
Notre Dame. .. . . . - “And there
appeared a great wonder.in heaven:
a woman clothed with the sun,/and
the moon / under, her /feet,, arid on-,
her head a crown of twelve stars.”-

IRISH BATTLE
KAZOO TODAY
Rockmen Open Stiff Schedule;
Freshmen Meet Western Normal:
Irish Reseves at St. Viators..
The hardest schedule in. the his-
tory of Notre Dame football will be
opened here this afternoon, when
the Rockmen take the field against
the aggregation from Kalamazoo
College.
The team from-the Celery-City
has played the first game with the
Fighting Irish for many years.
In 1921, Kalamazoo kicked off to
Notre Dame and “Chet” Wynne, at
fulback for the Irish, received the
ball on his own teri-yard_line,: and
sprinted eighty yards for-a touch-
flown; less than a minute.after the
opening whistle had blown.: From
then on,. scores followed in rapid
succession until the final whistle
blew and stopped the rampage, with
the/score at .58^0., . Last year, a
.touchdown "at.''the' -whistle ~wbn
agaiiv
■ Out of Rockne’s crew of scrappy
linemen, Captain Brown and. Kizer
iat the guards, Stange and Oberst at
tackles, Collins and Mayl on • the
wings, with Adam Walsh at center,
will probably start off the game.
Bob Regan, who is suffering from
the effects of a dislocated shoulder,
•will be unable to get into the game.
“The little geheral,” Harry
Stuhldreher, will be at quarter with
a speedy trio behind him composed
of Bergman, . Carney and Willie
Maher.	;
' Just as Rockne told the students
at the Pep meeting Thursday night,
“the game will be fought and won
jfrom the shoulder up.” This can
be verified any afternoon on Cartier
field, where during, practice sessions,
the Irish coach emphasizes the skull
practice. The great success of the
Notre Dame teams in the past, has
gone a long wayr toward proving
that brains and not brawn decide
'the final'score.	'
- Notre Dame will have . several
football teams around the country
oyer the week-end.. The Freshmen
team composed of Reilly, Berkery,
Murrin, . Maxwell,. Mullen,- Ash,
•Truckner, Meridith, Bielli,-Dienhart,
Marelli, McNally,. Jackson, O’Boyle,
Hanasck, Boland, Edwards, Whelan
and McMannon, will stack up
against the. fast Western Normal
team'. Coach Orlander, who at-
tended Rockne’s - coaching' school,
usually has a snappy: bunch, with
.lots of weight.	/
. This year, Orlander wilt be min-
us the services of ‘-‘Tiny” Redmond,
290-pound'center.; -
Rock . will send .a section. of-his
squad to Chicago to play St. Viators
,this afternoon. Rigali,- Cooke, Roux,
Eggert, Glynn, Harmon,' Newman,
Griffin, Grace, Lamont, Finch, Bar-
ry, Friscke, Brown, Roach, Coughlin,
Geniesse, Wallace,. McNabb ’ and
Sullivan, will -comprise the squad
that will battle Notre Dame’s great
rival in the “Windy” City.
Sunday afternoon the freshmen
will meet the fast Elkhart team at
that city, while/Brownson hall will
send their scrappy eleven against
the Roseland Panthers at Chicago.

• )	HELLO WEEK
■ The coming week has been designated as “Hello Week” at Notre
Dame.. This will be the second annual fellowship week at the Univer-
sity, the first one’having been introduced by the S. A. C. last year
during the week preceding Homecoming., The evident benefits, and
the still greater possibilities, of that campaign have led the S. A. C.
* to sponsor, through the newly organized Blue Circle, a second “Hello
, Week.” .	: .	-	:	.
As in the case of..the first “Hello Week,” the purposes of the
approaching, one will be to join the entire student body together more
closely, to encourage a better understanding and a more harmonious
cooperation, and to promote a true spirit of friendliness among all Notre
Dame men. The rapid increase in the number of students, and in
particular the. necessity of having many students reside off. the cam-
. pus, have threatened to destroy the unity of the Notre Dame family.
And it is in the preservation of this vital, unity that “Hello Week” ha:
its reason, for being.	i
, , The hello tags, which will be distributed by the Blue Circle,, and
. which should be worn by every: student throughout the week, will 15c
your invitation to say “Hello”; and your name written upon the tag
will constitute sufficient introduction. Wherever and whenever a" Notre
Dame man meets another, the friendly ’ “Hello” should be exchanged.
3^-rf^the- otherellows/hesitates^tb ■jspeak^-givet-him -{/-cheerful^-rHello^
anyway. It will set the right example, and give him the-courage to
pass the greeting to the next one whom he meets. ,	-
There will be plenty of opportunity for all to widen their field of
acquaintance during these days of ready, greeting. The way will be
made easy for the reticent freshman who has few friendsand even the
senior who has been 'a “good mixer”-will probably bg surprised, to. note
how many strange faces he has been passing each day. '
' ' The fact that the freshmen will be given a distinguishing tag should
not convey the.idea that they have been set:apart as inferior. On the
contrary, this arrangement should be a distinct advantage of the mem-
bers- of the freshman class. For unity of classes as well as unity of
the University as a whole is a thing to be desired, and that unity in
the class of ’27 may be best promoted if its members have a means of
' recognizing one another. It has been found that even the seniors of the
present year are unacquainted with many of those with whom-they
will, be graduated. By beginning to get together with their classmates
in the first year of college life, the men of future senior classes should
be able to end this regretable' condition. If the approaching “Hello
Week” and those.of coming,years can aid in the realization of this end,
they may indeed be regarded as having been successful. r
THE CENTENNIAL .
' ' . The century celebration upon • which .South. Bend isr so eagerly
entering this week, will strike a chord of convival pride at Notre
Dame., The liason between town and^campus has always been in-
. timate. While the adjacent metropolis was establishing the now solid
eminence of its industrial position, Father Sorin and his congregation,
under the shadows of the city’s smoking factories, laid the cornerstone
of" Notre Dame’s, prestige. \	x
‘ The story of South Bend is; the story , of the Middle West.
1 Originally a trading post that grew out of a passing Indian settlement,'
later the market and milling center: of a:wide agricultural region, the
city has evolved into a predominantly commercial community whose
prosperity/is the envy of .the nation^/ - ’	-	;	. ■
.: Successive waves of immigration have each contributed a ’ very
vital share in the expansion of. the Northern Indiana metropolis, add-
ing their undaunted-energy and activity to the-aggregate .of the. city’s
prolific resources. ’ Today wealth is evident on all South Bend streets.
Towering temples of business'-are increasing in number every 'day.
Two years ago South Bend-was ranked second among the cities of the
country by; organizations, that'record industrial progress. Last year,
South Bend, led the list. Prosperity and expansion continue} and
South Bend should lead the list - again this .year.' .	;	: .,
. -Not only has the city grown industrially, but her art exhibits
have been frequent; and valuable, -and her enthusiastic welcome to
• Shakespearian and concert artists is known everywhere. . ' .	;
' Nor. has South Bend lacked the /generosity. that- sanctifies
wealth. Notre Dame cannot forget the’ splendid 'demohstrdtibn/pf
, loyalty1 with which the townspeople threw/themselves/into the irecent
endowment drive. ; ,	'	.	'	; -	?	■ •
. . Now, in South Bend’s hour of triumph, Our Lady atop the dome
softly smiles. upon the city’s jubilation. , .	• ;

. Early this morning came the re-
port that Hooda had written an
economics paper on The Living
Wage.. The report said that he had
lost the,“W” on his typewriter, and
so used, a “G” instead. Obviously
enough, the paper was taken. for
an article on some sort of new heart
testing invention.. The office was
flooded with orders from cream.war-
riors who wanted one to see if they
were getting over with their queens.
. We sent out exactly six reporters
in precisely three minutes to find
Hooda and. get the concise meaning
of his paper. ’ The reporters re-
turned in a hurry, three of them
with , beer on their breaths we must
admit, but they all got back.
A Sharpe Knows, star reporter,
said, “I asked him. He said that
when he discovered the . ‘W’ was
missing he exclaimed, ‘Gee!’ That
accounts for it. I asked him no
more.’’
I. C.' Skandall, society, editor, re-
marked, “I have seen him and quiz-
zed him. He is a marvel. He said
it<had been stolen. • I asked him how
he got the typewriter and he said
he received it for a song. ’ I asked
him to sing it for me. He did.
I’d rather have the typewriter, even
with the ‘W’ missing.”	.
Ima Lyre, Snuggle Hints colyum,
said, “I. questioned him. He said
it had been stolen as far as he could
see. He. wears glasses so J.left.”
The other three reporters report-
ed that they had found a wonderful
story watching a schooner trying to
get off . a bar down by the river.

little merit and' less taste.
Mrs. Rudolph. Valentino, the head-
liner, appears, in a playlet written
on a theme by no means new, but
she. seemed - to get away. with the
audience. Whether jt was because
of the play, or'because she is the
sheik’s former wife, is hard to say.
George A. Mack, whose activities

musical comedy, sang a few songs
and told a few stories, much to the

The.Altar Steps, by Compton Mack-
;• enzie.; George H. ■ Doran Com-
pany, New York.'
“The Altar Steps” is a'bit of a
disappointment. Though it is a
good book it does not measure up
to the Mackenzie standard set when
“Carnival,” “Sinister Street,” and
“Plashers Mead” were written. It
contains no passages that one reads
over again and again because of
their thought or beauty, and it does
not seem.to.be as-lifelike, or worth-
while, as the other books written
by him.	’ :
Then again, it is a disappointment
in another way. When one finishes
“Sinister - Street” one is -interested
in knowing whether Michael Fane,
the hero of the. book, will become
a priest of the - Roman Catholic
church—that is, one wonders that
if one happens to be a Catholic.
Michael had been tending that way
all. through his, colorful years . at;
Pxford.andthe hook leaves him on
his: way, but not yet definitely set
toward Catholicism.’ When “The-
Altar Steps” appeared it was nat-
ural to assume that Michael’s story,
was to be continued. But Michael’s:
name is not even'in. the book. - •
Mackenzie has. the- admirable
habit; of continuing, the stories ,of
his characters in his ’ other books.
Like Barrie, he does not kill his;
characters with a book, but one-
meets them again, and again in the;
later books. To . meet the. old char-;
acters 'is pleasant—It’s like meeting:
old friends. ■	’	/ j
Mark Lidderdale,- the hero of!
“The .Altar Steps,” met. some of*
Mackenzie’s: characters,. but only:
cursorily. That is regrettable. . ’ :
:. Mark is the son of a minister of;
the English church, a man who him-i
self tends towards Rome, and who
awakens in Mark a curiosity regatd-i
ing religion. The story is'of Mark’s;

internal fight, and ends with him
seemingly reconciled to the English
church, though not far from' Roman
Catholicism.
To a Catholic the story, see'ms,
at first, to be unconvincing. The
arguments that Mark has met seem
to be sufficient to change his belief,
but a reconsideration of them makes
it: evident that they were not quite
enough.
In a later book, possibly, Michael
Fane and Mark Litterdale will fol-
low the path already trod by Mack-
enzie.—H. F.

Appeal to Golfers for Support of
New Sport; Ward, Adams
and Corbett Head Club,
The Notre Dame Golf team will
be organized and playing before the
outdoor season closes this fall, ac-
cording to plans worked out at the
Golf meeting held Thursday noon.
Rev.' Hugh O’Donnell was director
of the meeting at- which twenty
candidates reported to pledge their
loyalty to the latest branch of ath-
letics to be developed at the Uni-
versity. George Ward of Chicago
was chosen	manager	of	the	club.
Jack Adams	and	Jim	Corbett	were
selected' to	act	as	the	advisory
board. _	.
In order ’ that the qualifying
rounds’ might be played off with the
greatest pOASiblo success, early next
we§k, the officers of the club ap-
pealed to the men to. practice and
devote’their best efforts toward the
success of the organization.
The aid of the Athletic Associa-
tion is earnestly solicited and games
will be arranged with the best golf-
ing teams in the mid-western cir-
cle. The club will be operated on a
plan similar to the one designed for
hockey and which resulted in such
admirable success.
The team which will be organ-
ized this fall to compete with the
nearby Country clubs will give the
officials some idea of the material
Notre Dame will be able to place
in the field next spring.
All the men who have any inter-
est in golf, whatsoever are earnestly
appealed to, that they may arouse
all possible support and enthusiasm,
in the interest of the team and
Notre Dame will take its rightful
place among the golf luminaries of
the intercollegiate ranks. Notice of
all golf meetings will be published.
WILL BE BACK
Professor J. F. Hines, of the his-
tory department, who has been con-
fined to his home since Monday
with an attack of ptomaine poison-
ing, is now recovering. He expects
to resume work Monday.
