BY-PATHS
I greet you today with cheerful-
ness, inasmuch as I have several
letters that I may draw on, and a
firm resolution to enjoy the Frolic
(which, of course, will be compara-
tive gossip when you read this).
While making a reassuring phone
call yesterday to Miss Grumpy I
sought any new or startling infor-
mation that she might possess.
f	-o- -o-
“You’re shocking me," Miss
Grumpy replied—whereupon , it
took me five minutes to explain to
her that it was the phone that was
doing the shocking. Speaking of
lines, the worst I ever heard (over)
was furnished by the Bell Cd.

•But to turn from the human side
of Mr. Grundy, and get back to the
letters—some ardent feminist, or
several, suggested an idea, that is as
impractical as it is amusing:
“Tuesday morning you gave the
readers of the DAIl/Y a real treat
when through the courtesy of some
new-born Sherlock, the champion
woman-hater of Notre Dame was
made lenown. To be sure we are all
proud of this interesting discovery.
But would it be entirely1 inappro-
priate now to look for ' another
champion of the opposite ; kind?
What about the fellows who adore'
the fair ones? What about, our
students who get dainty letters by
• the dozens? Are they not worthy
of mention?”
Then the letter departs from its
theory and'proceeds to a practical
application (at too great length for
this column), naming, one Fagan of
.Corbyas having received .at.specific,
times an overwhelming amount of
mail “from such feminine. haunts
as St. Mary’s, N. Y. U., and Stout
Institute.” Further,. there is talk
of a social secretary, a missive
from “Marty,” and a threat or a
promise that Fagan will accompany
John Uebbing on a trip to Milwau-.
kee. “Isn’t Mr.’ Fagan .worthy of
recognition?” My only reply to that
would be another question—doesn’t
he seem to be getting it? ■
-o- -b-	.
In regardto a letter by John
Harwood, of Carroll, about the ac-
tivities ; of M. E. Nevils . I find
"Jawn’s” attitude to ■ be entirely
wrong.. He accuses me of “ crack-
ing wise about .the general public,”
next, he makes unverifiable—his
letter was unsigned-^—reports about
a staff-member. He even insinuates
that M. E. N; “eats typewriters.” I
can hardly believe that. Please add
your name to your ' next ;coin-
ihinique,- John Archibald, and it will
not be exposed.

shame, because he is a patron of a!

BACTERIOLOGIST
Well-known Scientist Gives Lecture
On “Hunting Big Game
in Africa.”
Arthur Coggeshall,. noted bac-
teriologist ..from the ‘ Carnegie In-
stitute of Technology, delivered a
lecture on . “Hunting Big Game in
Africa” in Washington hall last
night.
; Mr. Coggeshall,. who has had 35
years of hunting experience in the
forests of Utah, related the joys
arid., dangers of the life of those
who^-hunE' wld“animals.' " His~de-
scription- of the methods-.used in
capturing' the animals alive for cap-
tivity in the zoos and -meriageries
of civilized countries was particu-
larly interesting. ,
i Going into detail as to the man-
ner of capturing or killing the
beasts iri their native haunts,, he
described a number of ingenious
contrivances used for trapping. He
stated that many precautions must
be taken wheri it is desired to cap-
ture the animal alive.
Mr. Coggeshall’s intimate, know-
ledge of the peculiarities and mode
of living of those- animals with
which he: is familiar, made his. lec-
ture very interesting to the. stu-
dents who attended.

Water Basketball
Game Here March 8
Water basketball will be played
for the first time by the University
when the Notre Dame team lines up
against the Indiana sextet a week
from tonight. The Indiana aggre-
gation is more experienced. in the
game but it will have to offset the
fighting spirit of the Irish. The
first scrimmage was held on Thurs-
day and the team showed up wef
against the second string men.
Cerney, Gish, Stephen, Harrington,
Boland, Baier, and Cunningham are
on the squad.
The swimming team has also
been in training for the Indiaria
meet which’ is to precede the bas-
ketball game Saturday, March 8,
and the Indiana team will have to
go the limit to beat its less experi-
enced opponents. Weible, Alvarez,,
and McGoorty in the . dashes, An-
derburg and Graves in the 220,
Rhodes and Fogarty in the breast
stroke, Fuite in the bacjc-stroke,
and Anderburg in the fancy. dives
are expected to best Indiana.
A picture of the tearii will be
taken today in Bagby’s, 110 West
Colfax street, at 1:30.
TRACK PRELIMS
HELD THURSDAY
Freshmen Cop Twenty-nine of the
Forty Qualifying Places; Barron
Is Individual Star.
■ The first half of the preliminar-
ies of the. interhall track meet was
staged Thursday night in the gym.
Many promising varsity prospects
were brought to( light. Due to the
great-number—of-contestants, .some
good men. failed to qualify. '
i Barrori, brilliant freshman, broke
the. tape in the fast time of :05 1-10
for the 40-yard low hurdles. Mul-
lin, Riley, and Goulet were the. out-
standing performers in the 40-yard
dash; each covering the distance in
:04 7-10. In the quarter mile,
Masterson showed well, irialang a
strong bid for premier honors, only
to be nosed, out by Bernie Cough-
lin. This race was timed in' :53 2-5,
which is of varsity calibre. In'an-
other heat of the 440, “Red” Mc-
Donald fell when but a few yards
from the finish and thereby lost an
opportunity to, compete in the fin-
als. Nulty . defeated a large field
in the mile run, and Mayer, with a
heave of 38 feet 11-2 inches, took
first place, in the shot put.
. Of the five events contested, the
Freshmen;, to ok four firsts * and
garnered 29 of the 40 qualifying
places. Eight men in each everit
qualified for the finals which ,will
take place Sunday, March 9. Next
Wednesday the second half 'of the
meet will be ' run off. The races
scheduled for that day include the
half- mile, two mile, pole vault,
broad junYp, 220-yard dash, and
the. 40-yard riigh hurdles.
: The field is * well distributed
throughout all the various 7 halls;
and much keen competition is ex-
pected in. the finals. Gold, silver,
and bronze medals will be awarded
to the winners in :each event. Ev-
ery, race ..of the night was over-
crowded; in • the. dasri, 50 entrants

IRISH CINDER MEN
AT URBANA TODAY
Fourteen Notre Dame Athletes to
Compete In Harry Gill’s Annual
Illinois Relay Carnival,
Coach K. K. Rockne, Manager
Leo Sutliffe and a squad of 14 No-
tre Dame trackmen left yesterday
afternoon for Urbana, Illinois,
where the Irish will compete todty
iri the Seventh Annual Illinois Re-
lay Carnival. The following men
comprise the team: Barr, Layden,
McTiernan, Hamling, Cox, Barber,
Captain Kennedy, Hammill, Liver-
good, Wendland, Johnson, Wagner,
Harrington, and Eaton.
The Illinois Relay Carnival, in-
stituted by Coach Harry Gill, men-
tor of the Illinois track team' for -
the past 14 years,. has become sb ’
popular in -winter track circles dur-
ing the past five years' that it is
looked upon -now as one of the pre-
mier track classics of the year.
With the assembly every year of
the best track material in the mid- '
die west to coriipete for honors in’
the Illinois relays, one of the surest
things to be' expected as an out-
come of the meet is the bettering
of world records. Incidentally,
new stars are continually coming
into the calcium glare at each bf
these big meets. ’ v
Coach Harry Gill’s own track,
team will unquestionably play a
paramount part in the day’s events.
Year after year, the Illni coach de-
velops a well-balanced track team
that is very capable- of holding its
own in every event. Gill -will have
BroWnell in the pole vault, and
the Sucker bamboo artist looks
good in comparison , with the field
he - will :~have - to-face. -; The lllini / —
vaulter has been doing 12 feet, 10
inches with remarkable: regularity.
Brownell will have as one of his 1
most dangerous rivals, Brooker of ’
Michigan, who registered 13 feet,
2 inches in the conference outdoor
meet last year. There will also be
Jones, of Wisconsin, who has been
seeing the ground from a height of.
12 feet, 8 inches during the indoor
season.
The Suckers 'will be very well
represented in the sprints arid the-
special 300-yard dash events by a
pair of flashes, Ayers and Evans.
The Suckers are looking forward,
with no title uneasiness, to the
competition. that is. being prepared'-
for them by Layden and Barr of
Notre Dame, Irwin of the Kansas
Aggies, who burned up the century
last spring in :09 4-5,’ and Wilson,
and Brookins. of Iowa. Wilson is
the conference champ in the 220-
yard dash and Brookins is the
world’s champ in going over the
low barriers. Maddox, of Purdue, \
,will also be on hand for the sprints
as well as Wittman of Michigan.
The Wolverines look particularly
good in the two mile university re-
lay with such men on the squad as
Reinke and Kattendorf. The Mich- .
igan team will be’hard pressed by’
Illinois, . Ames . and Wisconsin. .
Brookins and his Iowa clan will be .
the features of the, mile relay,
while Notre Dame should move in-
to the limelight in the university ’	.
medley relay. Barr, McTiernan,
Cox and Kennedy sriould1 make a
splendid combination to offset the
rivalry of the Purple quartet from
Chicago which will also hold forth
with nb mean position in triis everit.;
The Irnrdle events are slated to
uncover some new stars for the
coming season or ,else give to trie
present record holders a life con- :
tract on the olive wreath. DeHart.
Hubbard, who already has a life ’
contract on the . broad . jumping
event with a leap of: 25 feet, 2
inches, will endeavor to put Michi- ’,
gari in the front rank of the riur- .
dlers’today. The colored athlete is .
due to give Charley Brookins arid, ’
Pitch Johnson more ; competition"
than .they are looking for. ■. Pitch
Johnson, captain • bf 'the Illinois-
team, equalled the-world’s^record .

WE EAT ONLY A LITTLE TRASH
A great deal has been said, and it will be strange indeed if more
will not be said, relative to the popularity of a number of current novels
whose tenor is calculated to arouse the curiosity of the semi-adult and
furnish him a thrill not provided by;Goodey’s Lady’s Book. ■
“This Side of Paradise” has had. its day; it was read and discussed,
after which it went the way of all best sellers. And the best sellers of
this type, and those which go a step farther, though now at their zenith,
will follow it in due time. These books are not read by all college
men, and for -those who do read them they are but a small fraction of
the reading diet, representing but one phase of the student’s. venture
into the field of books.
One is sometimes inclined to over-estimate the degree in which the
latest books—written by men who reach an astonishing- degree of
cynicism at the age of twenty-five—are taken up, and as a consequence
their importance is exaggerated, the impression being that they are
representative of the college man’s reading.
It is interesting to note in this connection—to take, up the other
side of the case—that a complete set of the works of Joseph Conrad
was placed on the shelves of the library a few weeks ago; and'that to-
day they are in -such' demand that~it-is as easy to-procure-a^quarto
edition of Shakespeare as a copy of “The Nigger of The Narcissus.”
It is a healthy sign, and one comforting to reflect upon, one which
vitiates to some extent the belief that college students are concerned
only with the modes of the moment.
THE COURAGE TO LET GO
This editorial is intended for freshmen. It may interest some
sophomores, even a few juniors, but the rqessage is for the freshmen.
Everyone comes to college with certain hopes, certain ideas for the
future, and the course of studies he selects is usually the. basis for theses
hopes and aspirations. But the selection of this-course-has too often
been influenced by parental suggestion or some vague, flitting idea
gleaned from the pages of a book or magazine. Very often the student
lacks either the ability, the imagination, or some other particular re-
quirement necessary to make a success of the course he has chosen, or
has had chosen for him. He usually discovers this in his freshman
year; “I never will get that math”—then what good will come of con-
tinuing engineering? “Chemistry is beyond me”; then why try to go
'beyond chemistry? The same holds good of English, and Accounting,
and Law, and other subjects. All these-courses now include men who
are unfitted for the work demanded of; them. Mediocre ability and
indifferent interest, during the'four years of college can lead only to
mediocre positions and indifferent success out in the world. And as it
has been said before, Notre Dame—and many another school too—has
too many mediocre alumni; she needs more judges where now there
are' lawyers, more editors where now there are reporters, more leaders-
where now there are followers. This, condition of mediocrity is paused
too often by a man’s unfitness for his work in school.' There are too
many graduate lawyers who never practice law, too many engineers
whose engineering ends with graduation. '
The point of this editorial is just this: If you are not in the right
. course, “let go.” It takes lots of courage to stick to a thing you are
convinced is a failure; but it takes just as much courage to let go and
embark on something new. You freshmen have found yourselves this
year. ? You have discovered your weaknesses, and; your strong points.
Look around you now and see if you are on the right track. If not,
switch in September. Don’t put it off until your junior year-—too
many do that and graduate:—with mediocrity! If you are still in doubt,
make it a point to find out before June whether you are following your
course from desire, or influence. If it is. the latter alone, let go, get
into something that you can put your heart and enthusiasm into, and
if you can make this/move. your freshman year has not been wasted.
And, if further you are convinced that your college years can lead to
nothing but expense and futile.endeavor, if education is not your “line,”
have the courage to let go :and give someone else an opportunity to take
your ‘place.> This is courage- of. a high order. .:
In The Literary Digest of today the so-called “young radicals” in
modern: American literature'are।described as having arrived at the brink
of the chasm their aesthetic souls have so long craved; and they are
further described as wearing, drooping; mouths and noses pointed to
, detect sulphur; in other words, they begin to,suspect that the freedom
they have, been howling for, now practically achieved, is become a
, fad. . And if theJ freedom to jump-into chasms has become a fad, it is
not for these fops. ; . f	;
. .Figure it but for yourself.	,
THE INK WELL
By DENNIS J. O’NEILL)
THE ROVER, by Joseph Conrad. Double-
day, Page and Company. Garden-City.
. The sea'and a picturesque, French
village on the shores of the Medi-
terranean form a characteristic
background for Joseph 'Conrad’s
latest: historical romance, “The
Rover.” A-blue lagoon, moonlight,
and * warm nights are the elements
which feed the flames of his hectic
passion for the beautiful; and he
throws in with them a charming
story of great simplicity and sus-
tained interest.
The simplicity. is especially no-
table in contrast with some of his
earlier works. There is lacking in
the Rover that careful analysis
and unfolding of character which is
found in the “Nigger of The Nar-
cissus,” for instance. The rover
and the lieutenant, the sans-culotte
and Arlette are none of them psy-
chological characters. Th fact, one
of them, Arlette, is not even log-
ical. She is the daughter of Royal-
ist parents who are murdered in
cold blood by the sans-culotte, a
fantastical patriot and the villain of
the stroy. Having, killed the par-
ents, he appropriates the daughter
and takes her home,—to her home,
not to his. Here he establishec
himself as lord and’master over the
estate; which she inherited on the
death of her parents, and gives Ar-
lette, who is living in a daze, and
her terrorized aunt .to understand
that the girl will be his as soon as
she has had time to forget.
His patience is wonderful, but
that of Arlette and her aunt Cath-
erine is still more so. Instead of
becoming perpetrators of a hatchet
murder, as the circumstances war-
rant, they submit themselves pas-
sively to his will; and they submit
themselves so thoroughly that Ar-
lette becomes reconciled to her fate
and probably would have accepted
the bloody terrorist had not the
hero come on the scene just in time
to awaken1 her from, her ^daze. If
this be logical, Descartes never ar-
gued in a circle. ..
The story is. that of an old' sea
dpg*.who 'calls 3‘himself^Peyrol and
comes home from his roaming tb
end his days near the place of his
birth. Conrad, the facile crafts-
man, weaves a whimsical tale of his
love for Michel, a helpful old man
scarcely more intelligent and not a
whit less. faithful than the dog
whose death leaves him alone in the
world; of the intrigue which
springs up between the young Lieu-
tenant Real and Arlette; of how
Peyrol sacrifices himself, 'together
with' Michel and Scevola the sans-
culotte, on the altar of France in
order that Arlette and Real might

It is a story told as only Con-
rad can tell it; and, although it is
by no means his best, the very fact
that' it comes from this - master’s

J. C. P.
HORSES AND MEN, Sherwood Anderson.
B. W. Huebsch: New York.
In- this collection of short stories
by the arch-contributor to ' Herr
Mencken’s “American Mercury,”
there is much of Theodore Dreiser.
In fact, it would seem that Ander-
son intended that there should be,
for the praises of Dreiser are elo-
quently sung in a sort of a dedi-
catory preface.
To counteract this • fault, how-
ever, the author confines himself
to such things as he is entirely fa-
miliar with. Rural Ohio, that the
author knows so well, forms the
background, for most of the. stories.
The book might be regarded by
some as a sort of text book on the
psychology of agriculturalists were
it not for ,the fact that the actions
and reactions of his characters suc-
ceed so ’well in telling, their own
stories. .
The first story of the collection,
“I am a Fool,” is a story that illus-
trates well Anderson’s understand-
ing of his characters. It is a story
that plays, bn. the emotions without
at any time ,becoming maudlin. The
other stories in . .the • collection
worthy of particular mention are,
“An Ohio Pagan,” “The Sad
Horn Blowers,” “Unused,” and
“The Man’s Story.”
All these short, stories prove An-
derson' a greater genius in . his
chosen-field' than, perhaps, we have
given him credit for being. They
compare very favorably with the
best that Katherine Mansfield and
Arthur Machen, for example, have
produced.

■ Janitor vs. President
“A college education is some-
thing you don’t need an express
jwagon to pack around with you,-
and it’s something that can’t be
taken from you. But to be val-.
uable it must be applied.”
This statement did not come from
a professor of education, but from
an old Scotchman—a night watch-
man. ‘ Such canny insight reminds
us of a situation which recently
came to light at Franklin College:
Both the president and one of
the janitors graduated, some years
ago, in the same class. One was
valedictorian and honor student;
the other was among the-lowest'in
Scholarship. The; latter was expect-
ed to become one of the “unwept,
unhonored and unsung.” He is now
president of his Alma Mater. The
valedictorian became a janior.
. It doesn’t take a Scotchman to
draw a conclusion from this. But
he .might remind the undergraduate
that hoarding knowledge is a miser-
ly trait. To be valuable education
“must be applied.”—The Daily
Californian. ,	'

“That this is true is demonstrated by those college men

“The White Sister.”

Oliver:

Blackstone:
'Pied Piper Malone.”
“Three o’clock in
the Morning.”
Palace: “Innocence.”
At the Blackstone
‘Three o’Clock in the Morning”
is a little bit of all right, but quite
a large bit of all wrong.
The story reminds one of a Ho-
ratio Alger novel, but is much more
melodramatic. ’A series of over-
worked incidents is climaxed by a
death-defying leap by the hero
from the deck of an ocean-going
liner, and an equally death-defying
half-mile swim to.shore, fully clad
even to his coat and shoes. It’s
really wonderful what these movie
actors can do when pushed.	i
Constance Binney struggles along
fairly well, until she pulls a Mae
Murray in the Cafe. Grotesque. Her
dance is fully consistent with the
decorations and name of the cafe.
Connie has acquired a bit too much
avoirdupois to be jumping around
like that; it’s bad for her arches. .
Even if dad had to sell the old
homestead, however, all the glyc-
erin tears are brushed away in the
end by a perfect understanding all
around.
When Louisa Alcott wrote her
famous “Little Meh” and “Little
Women,” she forgot to mention
Rose’s Midgets. There are no less
than twenty-four in number (count
’em) and their elastic repertoire
includes everything from acrobatics
to opera. This act is entertaining
and goes over very well.
P. C. M.
At the Palace
. This week’s show at the Palace is
dedicated to the principle that va-’
riety is not necessarily the spice of
life. There are acts of every de-
scription, .but in general- the bill
rlacks~what_ is. pugilistically known
as the “punch.” To be. brutally
frank, in our opinion none of the;
vaudeville numbers should be rated
better than fair.
It’s hard to. pick out the principal
act, but since “Sweet Sixteen”. is
given the position ’ of honor on the
progrhm, we’ll consider it first.
This performance.. contains some
good tandem dancing and one or
two clever songs. . The. rest of the
.act averages^ from mediocre to
mediocre plus.
' And then there is the Sunset
Four,’ who range in color from a
Shinola black and a tantalizing tan,
These gentlemen sing some planta-
tion melodies ^very, well, dabble in
comedy, and in general make
themselves highly entertaining. It
is good. '	.
Hunter and Frances have an act
that runs along right merrily, ex-
cept for odd moments, when it falls
into a perceptible limp. The skit
gives an interesting insight into the
comic capabilities of photographers
when taking pictures of. short-
skirted girls.
The Tom Davies Trio displays
artists on zthe Harley-Davidson.
They spin their motorcycle's around
a miniature speedway in a remark-
able performance which is at any
moment likely to become tragic.

Lemmonier Library
Has Book Bindery
With placards and books, Father
Foik has introduced to us a new
phase of the service which the Uni-
versity Ijbrary renders to the stu-
dents. The exhibit now on display
at the library illustrates every step
in the binding process from the
time the book enters the bindery
until it emerges as the finished pro-
duct. It shows the condition of a
book as it passes out of each of the
22 stages necessary. ,
The bindery in the basement is
thoroughly up-to-date; the work
turned out equals the production of
any professional bindery. It has
several unique features: the sepa-
rating and punching machines are
the invention of this library. In
all other plants of the country this
.work is done by hand. The bin-
dery is used to a large _ extent for
the binding of magazines into vol-
umes, so that they may become ac-
cessible for reference. zThis pro-
cess was formerly done by an out-
side bindery, but the quality of the
work was very poor. Determined
I to give the students the best, the
librarian set up the bindery and en-
gaged an expert to direct it.
Notre Dame, according to Father
Foik, is the only university that
| owns and operates its own binding
(plant. The bindings are as strong
las those of commercial firms, but
will, of course, break under, very
strong usage. Students are urged
to . consider the work entailed in
rebinding a book and use all rea-
sonable precautions to preserve the
binding.

' What Knute Rockne is to the
gridiron, Harry Gill is to track and :
field athletics. The famous Illinois .
mentor has developed many of the
most versatile track and field men
that have ever been seen in action.
A good number of his proteges
have established records that make
the name of Harry Gill.immortal in
this field. And Harry Gill deserves
the praise and recognition that are
accorded him. He has worked
strenuously for years to gain the
. success that has accompanied his
career. His creditable .work has
carved him a niche in the hall of
athletic fame.
The zenith of Gill’s career will
probably be reached this afternoon
when the annual Illinois Relay Car-
nival will be held at Urbana. This
yearly meet which was instituted
- by Gill, is regarded by the deans of
sport writers as the classic of the;
season. The select talent of the
. nation’s universities competes in
this carnival, and the one which
will be held today is expected to be
the greatest of the long line of
classics. The success that is sure
to crown the efforts of Harry Gill
at this meet is a worthy tribute to
his coaching ability. The cinder
men of the country pay homage to-
day to Harry Gill.
When Notre Dame students crowd
into the gym on March 12 to see
Pinkey and Ritchie Mitchell in ac-
tion, they will see the two craftiest
boxers in the hemped arena today,
with the exception of the champion
of their division, Benny Leonard.
Pinkey Mitchell can boast of
more skill and subtleness than any
pugilist at present, but with all his
tricks, he. lacks a great kayo punch.
He has. had several cracks at the
title and has made creditable show-
ings, but his inability' to put over
the deciding blow at the proper’
time has-cost him the crown. The
same applies to his elder brother,
Ritchie. Ritchie had Benny Leon-
ard in a deplorable fix several years
ago at Madison Square Garden but
he could not finish Leonard at the
time when a soporific punch would

farther toward the title Friday

All this talk about education'and
reduction of class hours and' too
many social activities, etc., etc.,
etc., that has been swimming back
and forth on our campus for* the

looked a most important bit of

see him afternoon, evening, and
night in the Oliver or the LaSalle,

a comfortable seat, a spittoon, and
a chance to display sartorial splen-
dor to the doubtful edification of
