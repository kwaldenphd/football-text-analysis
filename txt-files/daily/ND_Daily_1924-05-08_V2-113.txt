The . Glee club of the-University
sang several numbers at the-Palace
theater last evening as a . part of
the special program for National
Music Week. ..The three offerings;
of the club, “Drink to me only with'
thine eyes,”/ “Love’s Old Sweet.

typical Palace audience. -Vernon

Last night’s songs were‘in the
nature , of a final rehearsal for. the

cert which will be presented at the

Rev. Richard Collentine, C. S. C.,
formerly of the Mission Unit of the
order, and at present iMaster of
Novices, gave the May, devotion,
sermon last evening in the Sacred
Heart Church. His subject was
“The Blessed ’ Virgin.”
The entire theme of the-sermon
was wpund about the fact that a
student, especially a No'tre Dame
student, who attends a university
named after the divine mother,
spends his college life disadvan-
tageously unless he learns to recog-
nize Mary as .a real mother who is
always willing . to help him. He
mentioned that a fellow may have
excellent1 home training, congenial
and lovable parents, and other nici-
ties/of this world, but unless he
knows the meaning , of Mary as a
Mother hefis only an orphan. Ben-
ediction -followed the sermon.

Notre Dame will enter varsity competition in a new sport tomor-
T row when the golf .team tackles Northwestern in a match }at the Chain
o’ Lakes Ijnks. The tennis, team has recently begun an intensive sche-
-	dule.: • The entrance of university teams in these sports is an indication
, .	of-the growth of Notre Dame and of. its activities. It is a good thing to
see men further the interests of the universitiy in any line in which
they are active. The. tennis and golf teams should add to the fame
of Notre -Dame. -	’	- -	4	:
ON MOTHER’S.DAY. /

mothers who are living and those who have beenv called by their Make:
' from this worldly routine will be remembered in some special way oi.
. that day. Usually a box of candy, ^a bouquet, of roses, or a sentimental
bit of verse is given to those living mothers as a token of gratitude and
appreciation from their, children. A visit to. the cemetery is the cus-
-	tomary method of paying respect to the memory of a deceased mother.
.	And as an outward manifestation of the love felt for mothers,, a carna-
tion is worn in the coat lapel.	' .	’
-All of these conventional methods are splendid ways of paying the
1 degree of homage which our'mothers rightly are due. The world with-
out such conventionalities would be dull and uninteresting, and,an insi-
pid place in which to live. But when we'actually wish-to display bur
thankfulness for the.insatiable fondness, the. ever constant devotion, and
the tender affection which our mothers always have shown us, we should
do so not forgetting the spiritual essense of love. It was Scott who
. said that love is heaven ,and heaven is love. Certainly a mother’s love
is the purest, the noblest, and the most sacred—similar to" that Virgin
. love for the Christ Child,—and if this Tove finds its origin in heaven,
• it is godly, and we can best show our appreciation of it by remember-
ing our mothers next Sunday in our prayers.	'	‘	"
Father? O’Hara has had neat and appropriate spiritual bouquet
‘ cards printed for this Mothers’.Day custom, and every mother of a
Notre Dame man should receive one from her son.
“Flowing Gold,” the feature pic-
ture at the Orpheum during the en-
tire week, is about as good a two-
hour entertainment as has been of-
fered in some time. It is typical
Rex Beach story,, this time describ-
ing an1 oil rush instead of the usual
gold rush, anyway/it is a rush. Mil-
ton Sills and Ann Q. Nilson play
the leads, supported by an unusual-
ly’ clever cast. The. play runs the
entire emotional scale, from humor
to -pathos, with a" dash of piquant
excitement here and there sufficient
to lift it out of the common place.

Fellowes, in “Borrowed Husbands,”

For three days, ending Saturday,
John E.i Kellerd in “The. Amber
Fluid” will occupy thp . stage at
the Oliver. The' play was written-
by Arthur J. Lamb and is supposed
to be one of his best. It is a ro-
mantic mystery drama, with thrills,
comedy, and pathos.
The' Palace offers “The Daring
Years,” a story of' a mother’s love
and devotion for her son, who has
an unhappy faculty for j'umping
from the frying pan into the fire
and back again. Mildred Harris
and Mary Carr portray the prin-
ciple characters. A comedy-classic,
christened “Change Your Act,”
with Victor .More and Emma Little-

IT PAYS TO SMILE. .
:v The winning of a $40,000 home in a popularity contest by a traffic
policeman.’seems toz be an anomaly. Ordinarilly/ traffic cops are sup-
, . posed to be without.friends. For it is their privilege, and no doubt too-
often their pleasure, to reprimand loudly both the lowly and the mighty
onslightpro vacation.	•.	;	.	>
Yet in. New York City a traffic policeman recently won first place
in a voting, contest conducted by a candy concern. And thp secret back
of this extraordinary result was his smile. It was this that made him
a man from the.others engaged in the.same kindfof,trying and irritating
- work. He believed that the smile-behind the' forbidding hand\would
' secure the most willing co-operation and he, proved Tiis, theory to be.
correct, to the satisfaction of both his superiors and the public. And
. in the fifteen years that he has .directed’traffic at Lafayette and Grand
'streets, this human lighthousb in a swirl of passing cars has never been
known to lose his temper. .	•	-	'	'
'	. .The kindness, coolness and intelligence displayed by him at all
V times could.not fail t'o attract favorable attention. So.during the con-
' a test, many' admirers voted Tor the genial- officer without even knowing
' . his name. . They simply sent their ballots for “the traffic cop at La-
fayette and Grand streets.” .	.	(
Not only surly traffic policemen the country over, but also’peevish
individuals in all activities, might well take notice of-tlje winning power
of the honest and persistent smile. .It cannot bring a $40,000 prize to
everyone, but it can bring an infinite amount of happiness and satis-
:factionxinto the lives of those who smile and those who live and work
. with them.	‘	>
Many'a man poses as hard-boiled when he is merely a small fry.

Notre Dame made another ' ate
tempt to score in the eighth when
Quinlan walked, reached second oh
an error and third on a sacrifice
by Crowley, -but was put out by
Moomaw when he tried to get
home. Indiana idled out the game

Sheehan’s crew gathered ten hits off
Gause while Nolan was the only
local to get a walk. Gause'struck
. out three of the Blue and Gold bat-
ters.	-
Sheehan opened hostilities in the
first frame with a two bagger and
scored on sacrifice flies by Crowley
and Vergara'. In the Crimson’s
half of the first, Niness connected
, with a three base hit with two out
but Knight flied out to Vergara to
. end the inning. Notre Dame rode
-s blank in the second while McGrath’s
support in the second dampened
the Indiana batters in quick order.
Sheehan. singled in the third and
stole second after ,, Quinlan and
McGrath had counted for two outs.
• Crowley struck out and the Irish
. leader was left on second. A simi-
'lar order of events completed the
inning for Indiana. In the fourth,
Vergara doubled to deep right and
scored on. Nolan’s home run. Dunne
singled and . scored on Quinlan’s
'sacrifice fly to Lahoda. '
. Again elegant fielding support
ended the, inning for Indiana after
three of the Crimson clads had
.'come to bat. Sheehan opened, the
,/fifth for Notre Dame with a single
. ' and scored on Crowley’s two base
hit. Nolan singled but' was ,out at
second . when’ Dunne grounded to
the Crimson second baseman.-
