NOTRE DAME WINS
OVER LOYOLA, 5-0,
IN SECOND GAME
KEOGAN’S HITTING TEAM
KEEPS VISITORS FROM •
SCORING
The second appearance of Coach
Keogan’s baseball squad on Car-
tier field was marked by another
victory when the. Terriers' defeated
Roger Kiley’s Loyola university
nine, 5 to 0 yesterday afternoon.
The visitors showed up well on the
defense but when the Crimson ball '
tossers came to bat they were un-
able to count against the fast Work-
ing Keoganites. .
The work. * of McGrath 'on the
mound for the Blue and Gold gave
the visitors from Chicago little
chance to get on the bases.and the
few rallies that Kiley’s charges
staged in a desperate endeavor to
score, were promptly dampened by -
the local 'ball tossers. Loyola’s .five'
hits were scattered while Notre
Dame garnered seven from which
the five, run's were scored.
McGraw Pitches Well
Notre Dame opened the game
with two counters but the opposing
twirler tightened up for the next
; two frames and let; the Irish go
scoreless. The Keoganites picked
one run in the fifth and sixth in-
nings and another in the eighth.
The twirling of McGraw for the
visitors was one of -the features of
the encounter and although he was
touched for seven hits^-his support- . !
' faile'd^ him several times.' -The
younger ” collegians i made an im- -
pressive showing against the Notre.
Dame team . yesterday considering ■
the fact that they were playing a
little out of their class. However,
Kiley is developing a strong aggre-
gation with the material that he
has and competing with teams from
smaller colleges, the Chicagoans
should be. the leaders of their class.
A Hitting Team .
After the encounter yesterday,
the local -baseball follower can be
assured that Coach Keogan is de- ,
veloping a hitting team. The. rec-
ord bf the Terriers on the southern '
trip revealed the fact that they
could hit in the pinches when a hit
meant a run. Yesterday their bat-
ting power had not decreased the
least a'nd long drives into the gar-
dens indicated a hitting power that '
will be needed against ti cbnfer-
| ence teams.'
The return of Ed Prendergast to
the squad strengthened the team to
no little extent while Joe Quinlan
performed in creditable >s t y 1 e
around the. keystone- sack,. Gus
Stange, who relieved McGrath, in
the seventh inning, continued the _
■pace set. by his teammate and set
the opposing batters down in short
order. • .	' -	: >	.

Students of the university 45
years ago today were already enjoy-
ing their summer vacation, the re-:
suit of the disastrous fire of 1879
which almost destroyed all campus
buildings.	, . >
- The anniversary of the.great con-]
flagratidn passed on Wednesday,'
April 23. , Immediately after the
fire Father Corby, then president of
the university, announced that the
school term would be considered
ended, and that degrees would be
conferred upon .seniors the follow-]!
ing .day. . Plans for the rebuilding1
of the university were made the
same afternoon, and four days lat-
er they were ratified at' a/general
council of university officials. . ’
Origin Unknown
To this day the origin of the fire1
has not been learned. Workmen
had been busy oh the roof of the
administration building during the
morning,. and just before noon the
youngsters • on the minim play-]
ground noticed the flames blazing
from' the same roof. The inade-
quate fire equipment of those days
was. immediately , put into use. Aid!
was rushed from South Bend, then
cut off. from the University because'
of the .limited transportation faciE

ABOUT BILL SHEEHAN’S NINE,
Telling Notre Dame men to get out and boost a varsity team is
unnecessary. They’re, all boosting it. ‘
But. a. word about a more active support of .baseball might be in
; order. Captain. Bill Sheehan and the,-squad look mighty good after
- their, southern jaunt: and the first home games. Given the right kind
of encouragement, the team ought to make the middle west sit up and
take notice in the fashion of years gone by.	1 ' ' .
• . 1 /Encouragement of the right kind requires packed stands at every
; game, important or, unimportant, thatxis played on Cartier field. Not
: —‘ merely .paekedLstaridsy-but~a ?cheeringAhob-beg|prig/every-.-battc^
, and every fielder; to. dp the impossible. And this not for two or three
innings, but all the way until the last out in the ninth.
Tell Bill today you’ll be’around every afternoon his club plays.
. BUILDING FOR THE FUTURE >
t t --------------—	. I
Maj or-GeneraT Henry T.'Allenj in charge of , the work of the
. American Committee for! the ’Relief. of German Children,, is firiding,
even-in-America, a spirit of unforgiving. hatred hampering collections
and threatening the effort with; failure, according to editorial comment
; ; in a recent issue of the Literary Digest.	L	■ i .
The war is over and no matter what emotional waves of hate were
; aroused during its continuance, for. the good of the future, that hatred
should be forgotten. In Germany today there are 2,000,000 children.
They .will either grow up to love America, or they will'grow up to hate
'* America. The generation of today can influence them to feel which-?
< f ever way^ it may choose..C . - '	■ -	/	,	/ * C v .	.
- • Kindness/to these children, help in their days of need^ will create:
. in them a feeling of appreciation and admiratidn that will last. An
attitude of disregard will have the opposite effect. ; If we are to build-
for the future, a spirit of good will between nations must be-erected.
. The committee is doing a great work. Every dollar collected by
it goes to a, child needing food, clothes or shelter. Its address is 130

Though certain facts may ,lead us to doubt the usual reasonable^
. ness of groups of the only creature with rationality—the genus boobus,
. as. Mr. Mencken might say, we must‘eventually admit, not; with Mr.
.: Mencken this time, that these rational creatures are fundamentally and
eventually quite rational. Though^ led by fanatics, men may often do
peculiar. things, and though foolish ideas may seem to triumph, Doctor
Time generally restores'the common mind to. normalcy and common
snse.	'	'
In Oregon, for instance, it seemed that the. tempestuous attacks*
s , on the rights’ of parents to educate children, as they wished,: whether!
• they educated them well, had become successful. .. Arid if Oregon won!
such a ^victory, it seemed reasonable, to suppose that similar victories,
being waged in many other states; were likely in Other states; /
■ But though ;the people of Oregon, were marshalled against the pri-
. vate schools, the judgment of: a United States district court was just-
emphatic and categorical. The decision, it is .expected, .will be- sus-
tained by the United States supreme court, and will judicially settle,;
probably 'for all time, the contention, .put forth to serve the ends of;
bigotry, that,the state has. a fight superior to;.that of the parents in !
deciding the character of education, a child should receive.. The court!
decided that the law that'required all children of grammar school age
to attend the.’public schools was unconstitutional, because, it was :ari’
invasion of property and. occupational rights,, and it did not find it
■ 'necessary to consider the question of religious liberty.	•
‘ -i' ' The judgment was deliberate and.sane^ and the question may now
be definitely settled—thanks to Doctor Time, i '	/

.' Coach' Bill Roper, of. Princeton
/university,* 1 addressed a few remarks
to. the football candidates at the
banquet which, marked the close of
z the annual spring training period,
/stressing, the necessity, of keeping
up the individual scholastic grades
.in order that the team would, not
suffer from ineligibilities. .	.
The spring draining session was
' characterized by the ; Tigers mentor
as one .of the most successful that
he has ever directed at,the Jungle-
-town school. The six weeks of
' training uncovered a wealth, of ma-
terial which-will<be needed'for the
1925 ' campaign. - The * Princeton,
coach -pointed out the fact that the
■schedule for next year was one of
1 the heaviest cards that' the Tigers
had carried in several years. .

What Others Say
Seeing, is Believing
For the benefit of the man who
“never believes anything he hears
and only half wfiat he sees” the
Union Memorial' Building is now in
a position to demonstrate effective-
ly that it is nearing- the stage where
it can convince the skeptic of its
existence. There is an air of per-
manence about the putting into
place of solid stone, there is an at-
mosphere surrounding any enclos-;
ure with • window frames in place
which leads the beholder to'believe
that it .may some day be a building,
there is an exhilaration in watch7
ing a concrete mixer work ‘and a
crew of men pour the fluid into
molds from which a block of solid
stone will emerge. It is the idea
that he is creating something that
compensates the writer and builder
with a sense of contentment as
much as the check he receives fills
the wants of his daily life and it is
the result of the efforts of either
that signify to the world, that he is
actively engaged in his work with a
purpose in view. Of course the
Union Memorial : building is but afi
expression of sentiment, without
that sentiment, without active col-
lege life flowing through its halls
and being bettered and strengthen-
ed by that process it would be
erected in vain; but the appearance
of stone and brick in their proper
places for the future completion of
he building is enough evidence that
the other elements . are. shortly to
be added to elevate the spirits of
tho^e who
have the project at
Keart.
