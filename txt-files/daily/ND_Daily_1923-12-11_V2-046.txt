HUSTON ADDRESSES
THE SCRIBBLERS
Reveals Magazine Experiences;
Club Plans Banquet and Sale
of Book.
Intimate glimpses into the work-
ings of the editorial rooms of great
American magazines were revealed
to members of THE SCRIBBLERS
at ,their regular meeting last night,
by McCready Huston, editorial
writer for the South Bend Tribune.
“The most money for American .
magazine .fiction, according to gos-
sip, is paid by the Pictorial Review,”,
said Mr. Huston. “The Saturday
Evening Post is reported to be sec-
ond, while the publishers of the Red"
Book and Blue Book, a Chicago
firm, are ranked third. .
“One of the curses . of- writing
people is that a person will believe
that he can successfully write only
one kind of thing. I do not believe ’
that..is true. That is where your /
journalism, comes in; it is the ave-.
nue of a varied, training. :	; .
“A good mariy writers strive for
style. Style is a good deal like love
or beauty—you cannot always get "
it by strivingfor .it. Style is the
man himself, the expression of his
personality.”	:
Mr. Huston narrated intimate de-
tails of his own experience in writ- ,
ing, and in doing so stressed the . •
idealism which every young man
should strive to retain. In con-
eluding he said, “I can only talk to
you men like this because you live
in an institution which teaches you
to work for the improvement of
your. souls_as,-well:as of /your minds •
and bodies.. I would not have talked'
like that before the students of-my .
time in the state and non-sectarian
institutions.” ■	.
At this meeting Dennis O’Neil .
was appointed a committee of one
to confer with the officers in ar-
ranging for a hodgepodge banquet
which will be held on next Monday
night. Anse Miller, chairman of
the stationery committee, presented ,
samples of the new club stationery.
THE SCRIBBLEDS will meet at
12:30 Wednesday to complete plans .
for the sale of THE SCRIBBLERS’
BOOK OF NOTRE DAME VERSE,
which will be. marketed in all the
halls in a day or two. .	,	/	.

THE PROFESSIONAL BOOSTERS
Amid the noisy clang and prattle of the exponents of the “Notre
Dame Spirit/’ there has grown up at this school a class of men which
. may be somewhat appropriately named, the “professional boosters” of
Notre Dame. These men have this distinguishing characteristic: . They
• will get up from their beds on any cold morning at any time of the year
to distribute the DAILY, to make money for the ball or the prom, or
to help any, activity which has a semblance of merit.and worthiness.
> This editorial ' is one of commendation for the men who have been
blessed with this happy spirit of help fulness.-
It. is not necessary to quote names to make a list of these- “profes-
sional boosters.” Everyone on the campus knows that a certain group
of workers is laboring constantly to put aside money for the senior ball
and the junior prom; the men who solicit DAILY and Dome sub-
scriptions, who sell junior cartoon-books and senior pillow tops, who
take charge of group pictures and willingly undertake unpleasant
duties:for the publications, who dig barbecue ditches and give up the
pleasures, of Homecoming for the common good of the student body,
who put on the celebration for the student trip at Toledo, these men
are on the lists of the “live wire” body of “professional boosters.” The
men of this, group, if approached:by the director of a worthy campus
project; w.oiild be , willing to sell hair : pins to the freshmen, and miss
preparihg fbf'an examination to do'it. - ;	~ ‘ >••	--- ’ '
Of these students who are giving: so much that the activities of
Notre Dame may be advanced, it is difficult to say anything adequate.
However, it may be foreseen that, in the: general scheme of life, the
■ spirit which they have developed at Notre Dame will carry them to
success.; Gratitude, and success to you—“professional boosters”: of
. Notre Dame. . ’	:	‘
.THE STUDENT CONVOCATION
Considered-from every angle, the convocation held Friday in Wash-
■jngton hall was a success.	/
Student discussion of problems of campus life is from time to time
; advisable. Responsibility for conditions, whatever their kind, is di-
. vided at any university, between the institution and its students. When
' the: men. who attend the school show;signs of taking an intelligent inter-
est'in problems, npt only as they. affect themselves, but as they affect
the university, it is an encouraging, indication of whole-hearted interest
in university life. Students will always have complaints. Sometimes
those complaints are less real than they seem, spmetimes they are an-
. swered when misunderstandings are brushed aside, sometimes they dis-
appear when-brought under, discussion. A convocation such as that
held Friday, is one means of bringing them out into the open. And a
complaint is better aired than nursed along in the mind of a student.
.The Student Activities, Committee labors earnestly, and also hon-
, estly, in behalf of student interests?' It never was meant to be a mere
‘ buffer between students and faculty. It should not be that now. There
never can:be any wide separation'of interests between faculty and stu-
dents. At ..Notre Dame there never has been. At times students may
become selfish; there may occasionally be misunderstandings of one
. kind or another. But the purposes of the University, both faculty: and
students, can be best satisfied when there is cooperation between the
' administration^ andthe 'students. ‘The agency of the Student Activities
Committee therefore must be one of cooperation. When the committee
calls a convocation; it is going back to the students as the source of part
: of that cooperation.;’ It is turning to them for. suggestions. The com-
mitteejs., merely a servant of the; students.. The student convocation
is’one of,the .means .which the committee, as a servant, can use to make
.its-service more effective.	- . i - . ; ’	\
... The convocation; held Friday: should not be the last. The Daily
' trusts that it will not. be. .	--	?	-
RED CROSS SEALS
Red • Cross Christmas-seals will be on'sale here on the campus for
three days, beginning today. ?
The Red Cross is doing a great work and deserves whole-hearted
^ support in its war on tuberculosis. The .white plague is one of the
"most.prevalent .as .well,as the most distressful diseases in our country
,at the'present time, and its nature is "such”that .the Red Cross must
educate the people.in ^methods of prevention; it must also give financial
and medical aid to those unfortunates who are stricken with the malady
• and. are unable to care for themselves.'■ '
< It doesn’t cost much :to; buy :a few Christmas seals; the sacrifice
that it entails, would perhaps amount to no more than the price of a
/ movie or a pack of cigarettes. But you could not give your money to a
worthier or a more deserving cause. .	-	'?•;
Now is the time to investigate time tables. . .

The Editor THE DAILY:
Why all the worry . about the
small number of books taken from
the library? They last longer when
left alone. But seriously, how can
the average man at Notre Dame find
time to read books other than those
required in his course? I have not
found time, and I have been trying
for some three winters and sum-
mers. If’we were required to take
noc more than sixteen hours a week
class work as is customary in other
colleges and universities, we cer-,
tainly would deserve scathing criti-
cism for not overworking the li-
brary on our campus, but when a
man takes twenty-two hours a week
and writes several books for eco-
nomic class, participates a reason-
able amount of his time in campus
activities, attends church per sched-
ule, supports his class dances and
smokers—why, by dear editor, I
have had enought time left to get
an average of six hours sleep a
night and ^1 participate only mod-
erately, most moderately, in the
things expected of a Notre Dame
man. Surely, we want to readi but
the day in this part of Indiana has
only twenty-four hours.
Thank you.

At the risk of appearing generous

entertainment, however.	x

of poetry prizes! The Nation is of-
fering its annual prize of $100 for

Not more than three contributions
from one author will be considered.
The subject'and the form of the
poems are left to the writer’s
| choice. Free verse may be sub-
mitted and there is no designation
concerning meter. However, no
poem should be over 400 lines in
length.

. The West Point football directors
are displaying an uncanny eagerness
to import a few- of the football
brilliants that “the ghost of the past
season gave up” for the world ■ to
admire. Press - dispatches from the
East, disclose the fact that Harry
Wilson, Jimmy Robertson .and one
or two other stars were being sought
by the military academy; for ser-
vice in the Pointer’s backfield. . ,
. Considering, the possibility ; of
these and other stars on the. service
teams being considered for positions
on the mythical All-American, it
does not seem fair to the .men:in
the other colleges who must thus
compete for honors with; men who
have played, for, six years. Further-
more, the man that was a star and
rated as All-American in his college
days /has the advantage of three
years experience over the average
college7 performer. If the All-
American selections are made on the
basis of all-around playing ability,
the six-year service , man holds an
undeniable : advantage with which
to win-his. mythical berth; ■ ’
