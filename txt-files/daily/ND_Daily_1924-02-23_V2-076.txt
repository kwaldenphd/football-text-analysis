BY-PATHS
Because of my nocturnal habits
(which interfere with early rising
on holidays) and through respect
’ for our beloved seniors, I was care-
ful not to attend the Exercises yes-
terday lest I chance upon any ab-
surdities of the scholastic black
robes. So both the fits and the mis-
fits of yesterday are spared from
pleasing publicity. I pray you un-
' i, excuse me, and sen-
derclassmeii;

The brief’respite from the grind-
stone of classes enables me to. wan-




der off-campus. Quite curiously I
• wandered into the Oliver, where as
usual my attention was attracted
to the lounging done so satisfac-
torily near the fountain. It seems
to me that a course in “lobbying”
might be taught by any one of the
occasional triumvirate of Lyle Mo-
. rency, Harvey Reed, and Vincent
Clerise. Or, what preferences have
you?	.	-

nis activities of theirs, saying that
they are fond of the game because
love plays an important; part in it.

Notre Dame Boxers
. in Finals Tonight
The Notre Dame boxing team,
which went into the preliminaries
of the Hoosier Athletic Club box-
ing tournament last night at In-
dianapolis, will enter its survivors
in the affinals tonight. Reports on
the preliminaries were unavailable
at a late hour last night.
D. McGowan, E. Miller, M. Keefe,
P. Canny, E. Shearer, M. Schaell,
C. Springer, and F. Cahill, left
Thursday for Indianapolis to rep-
resent the University in the Hoosier
Athletic Club boxing tournament.
The Irish, mitt slingers have been
training faithfully and it is prob-
able that they will bring several of
the titles, back to Notre Dame. All
the fighters have been showing good
form and they are in the pink of
condition for the contest. •
BOY MOVEMENT IS
STARTED BY K. OF C
Thirty Scholarships to Be Awarded;
Course Begins Next
September.
Of all the Catholic colleges in
the United States, Notre Dame was
picked by the Knijghts of Columbus
as the seat .of the Boy Movement,
chiefly because of the democratic
spirit found here. The purpose of
this movement is to take care of
the Catholic boys during their leis-
ure; hours, and by doing this to try
to stem the crime wave which is
flooding the country.' Since a great
part of the crimes of the country
are committed by: mere boys, it is
believed if these boys are kept oc-
cupied during their; free time, they
will keep but of mischief.
The Knights oF Columbus have
endowed thirty scholarships for this
work at the University. Mr. Ray
Hoyer has been appointed head of
this-department, in view of his ex-
perience in this field of work. / He
is a graduate of the. University of
Pennsylvania, and has been en-
gaged in boy work for the past . 15
years. He is capable in every way
to instruct- men in this course.
‘ Applicants for this course must
have four previous years of college
work with an A. B. degree. The
course lasts two years, at the com-
pletion of which a Master’s Degree
is given. Nation-wide interest has
been taken in. the movement and

Harry Gill is to develop track ath-

met with no small ; amount of suc-
cess, . having produced some of the
best men - that ever competed in
track and field athletics. At that,
he is barely comparable with our
famous mentor, and a close meet is
predicted. However, Illinois is fa-
vored •with many veterans.

Alfred Doyle, as William Ells-
worth probably contributed : the
most noteworthy performance of
the evening. His ease of delivery,
natural gestures, and distinct pro-
nunciation compelled attention,
which is the criterion by which ev-
ery speaker may be judged.- .
Mark Nolan, winner of the State
Oratorical Contest, gave a. very
satisfying performance as. Alex-
ander Hamilton. Bert Dunne is to
be complimented on his part, which
was the longest, thus involving the
most memory work, and which was
delivered in a creditable manner.
Clarence Ruddy, supplied a hum-
orous element in his characteriza-
tion of the delegate from Maryland.
Although . slightly . overacted, this
part was highly . refreshing, and
served to color the.even tone of the
play, which without it might have
been monotonous. ;	.
' Leroy Hebbert and Bailey Walsh
also added a great'deal to the suc-
cess of the play.: Much credit is
due to the author for his well-writ-
ten script, to Mr. Reynolds and the
entire cast for their excellent in-
terpretation of it. <

PRESIDENT LAUDS
CODE OF PATRIOT
Don Gallagher Presents Flag to
University; Graner and Koch
on Program.
“As every new national problem
arises we are being forced more
and more to return for its solution
to the principles of Washington,”
said Reverend Matthew Walsh, C.
S. C., President of the University,
at the annual exercises held in
Washington hall yesterday, morn-
ing in honor of the birthday of
George Washington.
“Washington taught that we have
no religious tolerance in America,
because tolerance . implies a per- ,
mission, a concession; what we have
is religious freedom,” said Father
Walsh. In substantiation of the
greatness of the principles of Wash-
ington, particularly as they applied
to religious freedom, Father Walsh
quoted extracts from Washington’s
letters to the Quakers, Catholics,
Baptists, and New Church mem-
bers. Father Walsh’s closing
thought was, “By the time you Sen-
iors have arrived at maturity I ex-
pect to see another religious per-
secution in America. Then will the .
time be ripe for invoking the prin-
ciples of Washington.”
Father Walsh was preceded on
the program by Donald S. Gallag-
her, President of the Senior , class,
who, in presenting the University
with an American flag, the gift of
the Seniors, spoke of . the sound re-
ligious and patriotic principles with
which the University has imbued
the class of ’24. He promised the .
class’ continued loyalty to the fun-
damental -tenetsof. Americanism,
and assured the University, of the
love and veneration in which the
class of ’24 would -forever hold it.
The program was opened with an

Dame the more, read “The Plastic
Age.” Percy Marks paints a col-
legiate picture that is unsatisfying,
colorless (except for profanity and
a conscious tendency toward the
risque) and even bordering upon
insipidity. If Notre Dame men
don’t lead a more distinctive life
than Hugh Carver led. at Sanford,
they are in a bad way. But,, thank

" We presume that you have read
Owen Johnson’s pseudo-heroic con-
glomeration of dribble, “Stover at
Yale,” and Fitzgerald’s stimulating,
scintillating “This Side of Para-
dise.” The first 40 per cent of
“The Plastic Age” is the typical
rah-rah boy, “For the love of my
mother I will be a big man at col-
lege,” “Stover at Yale” sort of
thing. The second 40 per cent
tries to follow “This Side .of Para-
dise,” but gets lost far, far on this
side, and not once approaches the
true Fitzgerald style. The last 20
per cent is. a combination of the
“Stover at Yale”, and “This Side
of Paradise” ideas, and it does
something to redeem the book.^ The
first striking thoughts of the book
are here offered by a professor who
first calls college men numbskulls
and then felicitates them upon the
fact that, unlike most of mankind,
they at least have skulls.
The frat problem is just about
settled by Marks. His true' senti-
ments on the matter, divested; of
the camouflage he tries to cover
them-with, can be detected in his
summary of the. questions frat men
ask about a prospect: “Did the

THE NEW PROGRAM
Beginning with the fall term of 1924, a revised schedule of courses
will be offered in the College of Arts and Letters. For a long time a
modification of the curriculum of this college has been contemplated I
to eliminate a great many problems which have confronted the deans of
the different departments — problems concerning the changing of
courses, pleas of overburdening hours, and the lack of elective hours in
some of the courses compared with others which come under the same
general heading. Under the new schedule the seven degrees - offered
heretofore by the College of Arts and Letters will be replaced by the
one degree of Bachelor of Arts, to be granted all students who graduate
in any one of the twelve departments to be instituted under the new
plan. These departments are Philosophy, Classical Languages, English,
History, Economics, Politics, Sociology, Education, Journalism, Li-
brary Science, Modern Languages and Music. A decrease in the total
number of credit hours necessary for the degree has also been made.
Instead of the 174 hours which have, to this time, been required, 144
hours, with a weekly maximum of 18 hours, will be demanded. Of
these 144 hours, 78 wil be for prescribed subjects, 39 for subjects
peculiar to each-department, and the remaining 27 hours ■ will be . elec-
_ .tive^The,.39Uiours..specified Jcor each department .will ;be allotted to a
major and a *minor subject, .the’‘former' to cover 21 “hours and the
latter 18 hours. In the freshman year, the curriculum for all depart-
ments in the college will be the same.
A complete exposition of the new program is made in this month’s
issuef of The Scholastic by the Rev. Charles Miltner, C.S.C., Dean of
the College of Arts and Letters. Father Miltner emphasizes the fact
that-“All students then registering (in-the fall term of 1924) will be
required to carry the subject inscribed on the then existing program
for the respective years of their college courses in whatever department,
they may be enrolled.” Everyone who will be affected by this modifi-
cation of the program should read carefully Father Miltner’s article,
and learn the reasons for the change, the advantages to be derived from
it, and in what particular way it will apply to individual cases.
The change, we think, is a good One. Few universities offer as
many as seven degrees from their College of Arts and Letters and the
generally accepted practice is to offer but one, and that one the A.B.
degree. The cut in the number of class hours too, should be a change
for the better. It will -permit greater effort to be concentrated upon
certain subjects, and for the earnest student should help provide that
longed-for “time” to read and to write, and to do the research work
which most .of us would like to do, but which, in most cases, unfortun-
. ately and somewhat illogically, must be postponed until after college
days or, at the best, until the fifth year of college. The change is a
decided step forward for the College of Arts and Letters and, as
Father Miltner states, “brings our requirements, both for teachers and
students, into closer conformity with standards approved and accepted
as well by Catholic as by secular educational experts. . . . .”

MOTHER
; Last night, Mother, I heard a song which has made me think
very much of you. Walking under the cold winter moon, many things
• which have happened since my leaving for Notre Dame come back to
my memory. It seems that I have not written to you as much as per-
haps I should;-you probably wonder, Mother, whether your boy is
growing away from you. To write more often to you, to make of my-
self a good man for your sake, to do everything that you might be.
: happy, that is to be more important to me throughout the regaining
period of my college life.
; You no doubt received the valentine which I sent. Valentines
; are but tinselled things with pretty meaningless phrases; this, Mother,
: shall be my dearest wish for you: That you may never await a let-
f ter from me and be disappointed; that my college life may reflect
glory upon you who educated me so.carefully; that in college.and after
; college, I shall bring the smile of. joy to your lips rather than a frown
to your sweet face; that! shall, by ..attending to those little kindnesses
which" mothers "appreciate" so much, make'yqu liappy—this is the wish
- of "your son. Mother mine." ;	• j
;	: What a life! We serve God by fits and.starts; we have.cold fits
j and hot.fits,.like, those that are struck.by fever; sometimes we are in
: earnest, sometimes we give up; we are carried away, by gusts of tempta-
tion; a frown of the world will kill off all our good resolutions. Such
is our-life—perpetually tossed to and fro like waves of the sea.—

' Baseball players: are welcoming’ the leap year by jumping their

; ' Have you noticed the black and
tan; dog that has been visiting
classes in the library of late? Well,
rumor has it that Nebraska has sent
an advance guard to get the “dope”
on the foot-ball team. Could this
hound be the fspy?
The animal has also visited the
various halls; "on the campus and
the gymnasium. This has aroused
the suspicion’of the entire student
body and Excitement is at a high
pitch.
; At first a .large number of the
boys laughed at the idea of-Nebras-
ka sending a dog as a spy but “Ter-
ry” advanced the theory that it was
not an unusual thing for a coach to
call upon a dog to; give his services
for the cause. Between groans (it
will be. remembered that he is suf-
fering with the “heebie' jeebies”),
Terry informed us that his mother
was an advance spy for the Urii-
.versity of -Dublin. -	. - <
The spy was first observed at a
history class in the library, and all
;the students thought that it would
be rather unusual-to have a dog in
class-so they allowed the animal to^
remain. ; The' spy curled J up in a
seat and soon appeared fast asleep,
but whenever a football player was;
called upon for a recitation, he
pricked up his .ears and listened at-
tentively. He: appeared to.be mak-
ing a mental note of the athlete’s
ability' as well as of his physical
condition. ./< "	•

corner of, the gymnasium watching
the football team run through sig-
nals. While lit -is hoped that the

Hugh Carver, the hero, is one of
those men. whom sophomores like
even when he’s a freshman, i. e., he
has a winning smile and blonde
curly hair. Mr. Marks considers a
hero with such qualifications to
need no others — consequently he
gives the dear lad no others. Mr.
Marks, you see, is logical even when
ungrammatical.
But we forgot—on page 218 ou\
hero becomes a cynic. The author
makes him cynical about women;
What he should be cynical about is
the fact that he and his companions
evidence about as much distinctive
personality as one of Mr. Clark’s
coffee cups—and almost as much
dirt.
On the whole the book helps us
to re-discover the fact that Notre
Dame is not in the least like other
universities. And if they are as
“flat” as their biographers make
them, our enrollment department
should immediately take it upon it-
self to see that some capable man
write the story of Notre Danie life.
It would not only be a best-seller,
but, by contrast, a best-advertiser.

At The Palace
“Me that have seen what I have
seen” can tell you that the simple
price of admission to the Palace
this week is a darn good invest-
ment in entertainment. There is
really no outstanding star, but ev-
ery act delivers the goods in big-
league fashion.
First on the program is Rekoma,
the man with a Pullman car name
and a surplus of muscle. . We are
usually affected by that tired feel-
ing during a strong man perform-
ance, but this act is different. Re-
koma is very good.
Calvin and O’Connor are black
as the Gold Dust Twins and they
. entertain. The fun never threat-
ens to get boisterous, but we rec-
ommend this one for a good, con-
servative comedy act.
The Miss Jean Adair Company
presents a one-act play which is a
satire on the flaming youth of this
day. Comedy is sprinkled gener-
- ously throughout, and the whole
performance is interesting and en-
tertaining.
He’s one of those “nut” comedi-
ans, and his name is Walter Weems.
Foolish? Yes. Silly? Occasion-
ally.' Funny? Very.
The Dale-Ellerom players have
an act that is of an artistic nature,
featuring ballet dancing and violin
solos. They show a heavy line and
a neat array of backs, so the act
gets by pretty well.
“Is Money Everything?”, asks
the picture, and then it takes Nor-
man Kerry anil Miriam Cooper a
full hour .to deliver the message.'
In case there is any doubt, the ans-
wer is that money isn’t all that it’s
. cracked up to be.
The_ohLreliables, _an_Aesop’s Fa-
ble and a'Pathe News complete the
bill.

Another of New York’s famous
churches will soon give way to the
commercial development of the part
of the city lying between Pennsyl-
vania station and Times square. St.
Chrysostom’s chapel, a simple little
Gothic structure, modestly conspic-
uous for years in the midst of its
drab surroundings at Sevents ave-
nue and Thirty-ninth street. Trin-
ity church has announced that it
will give place to a great commer-
cial building. St. Chrysostom’s was
built in 1868 and while by no means
one of the oldest churches in the
city, occupies a strategic position
close to the white lights of Broad-
way.—New York Post.

for the state of Maine, heads a
committee to investigate the mat-
ter.	; '
Rapael Herman, retired manu-
facturer of Buffalo and Detroit, has
offered to endow such a university
with $1,000,000. Colonel Edward
Fletcher of San Diego has expressed
his willingness to give three hun-
dred to five hundred acres of land
near the city for the university if
it is located there.
Barcelona and the Hague have
spoken for the university also. Ac-
cording to present plans it would
receive ten to fifteen graduate stu-
dents from each of the 72 coun-
tries in the world, making a total
of 1,000 students.
Two years of study would be
spent in world travel. The other
two years of schooling will be
spent in study at the university.
World civics will be prominent in
the curriculum as well as foreign
languages.*
According to Dr. Thomas “the
university would be non-political,
non-prejudiced and non-sectarian.”
It would tend to make a bond of
world fellowship. Such a plan is
worth the consideration of educa-
tors and of students.
Theoretically, the university
should bring world friendship.
Groups of students gathered from
all countries should learn world
problems and have world, (vision
and sympathy. Racial barriers and
misunderstandings would disappear
and in their place would arise har-
mony and peace.'
From the practical standpoint a
world university would be extreme-
ly difficult to administer. In the
first place there is the very simple
but serious problem as to where to
locate it. This would be overcome

by placing it in the United States,
the most cosmopolitan of nations.
Secondly, there might arise the
question as to how many students
the various countries might send.
Would it be fair to permit such a
small nation as Belgium to enroll
as many scholars as a country the
size of Russia?
Again what type of student
should the nations send? Should
only the young men who intended
to enter the diplomatic service be
accepted? Will not the women be
given a opportunity? The question
of financing such an institution is
also a serious problem. Are the
students to pay their own tuition
or the nations from which they
come pay?
These are only a few of the
questions that will arise when Dr.
Thomas and his committee begin to
consider the feasibility of a world
university. In the final analysis,
we believe, that world peace and
harmony can only be achieved
through education and that it is
high time to formulate a practical
scheme for such education.—

OFF-CAMPUS BEATS
BROWNSON, 32-21
Day Dogs Strengthen Hold on
Second Place; Interhall
Games Postponed.
In playing ~off a postponed game
in the gym last Wednesday nighit,
the speedy off-campus aggregation
handed a 32 to 21 defeat to the
Brownson team. Starting off with
a rush the tossers from Brownson
registered three field goals in quick
succession, a lead that was kept
throughout the first half. The
score stood 14 to 11 at the end of
the first frame in favor of Brown-
son. The Day tossers found the
basket a few minutes after the sec-
ond half started and opened an at-
. tack. which was too much for the
Brownson team to stop, and the
final whistle found the Day shoot-
ers with an eleven point lead. Both
teams played well but Day’s ability
to sink shots from, any position on
the floor, decided the contest.
As. a result of the contest Brown-
son goes into a tie with Sophomore
and Freshman for sixth place, all
having two victories and four de-
feats, while the Day team strength-
ened its hold on second place with
five wins and one defeat.
On account of the large number
of interhall basketball men being
absent; from the University over
the week-end, the five games sched-
uled for tomorrow have been post-
poned until the following Sunday,
when the regular schedule will
