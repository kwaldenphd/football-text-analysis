INTELLIGENCE
A group of meh. who attend Notre Dame rode to town on a Hill
- ' ‘street car the other day. One, who wished to impress his distinctive
qualities upon the others, arid who wished to show the women on the
car that all brave men had not died with the passing of the days of
chivalry, took from his pocket a flask of forbidden fluid, drank , and
: looked about for commendation.	:
’• He is.a brave man; a.clever man; a man of intellect.
: MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME.
■	^ PARK THEM AT HOME
“Experience show’s that an unusually large percentage of students
'. having automobiles fail to graduate.” :	'
So says Dr. Stratton D. Brooks, president of the University of
..Missouri.	. ; ■
... ‘.‘The possession of cars by students too often, leads to a serious
waste of time, to the growth of many forms of extravagance, and to
. an increase in practices which, besides distracting the students from the
purposes for which they come to the-university, involve moral risk:”
So. says President M. L. Burton, of the University of Michigan.
Park your car at home, University presidents are saying to stu-
' dents' everywfliere; . The Notre Dame Department, of. Student Welfare
has issued a similar, warning do-.cariipus jstudents.;</At;Nptre. Dame off-
~ ' campus” iheh, iwho"fihd”cars; ‘a "convenience inTcomihg' to the campus fpr
class, are not forbidden to owm cars.
Forbidding .students to owm cars is, in many ways,, good.
. Expenses tend to mount when a car is near to tempt one. The
/lure of the cooLopen road, of‘a pleasant companion on a lulling drive,
‘.is strong. It is likely to be more attractive than a journey into the
‘world of books. Serious accidents, which have resulted in- the
death of many students, have caused the rule against cars at many
■ universities. Feelings “hardly consonant with the traditional democ-
'racy of the university,”, inevitably arise when students who cannot
fafford automobiles associate daily ’ with those who can, the Michigan
. <dean points out.	‘	•
r . ' The student; must choose^ according to the deans, between sheep-,
iskins and, Chevrolets.
alb on friendly terms-and with all
striving to help one another. :
So then, do the different mem-,
bers of a. family need an introduc-
tion by a third pa^ty? . Why, :’tis
absurd.’ Are we, who daily tread
these halls of learning,- who are
striving toward the same end—7
7—namely to obtain an education—
whose existence and life are bound
up in Boston . College, whose en-
deavors in the various lines of col-
legiate activity are-to make Boston
College famous—in short, all mem-
bers' of the sariie big family—to
need a formal introduction? ,	• 7
. Come now, ye students, wake up
and become acquainted with your
brothers, by speaking but to them,
j for you are not strangers speaking
many tongues, but all riien of. the
same brotherhood with a common
bond.
From Other Pens I
What They Say
. Notre Dame says that if the.game
had lasted ? a few moments longer,
the Irish would have won. And now,
Ames thinks the same thing. ■ It is
idle patter, to reckon into the cham-
bers of unpassed ‘time.—Daily Ne-
I braskan. . .
(Boston College Heights.)
Perhaps we have witnessed the
following ,in -the • car on. • on' /the
^street:	■- • ■'
f . Two. or three students are going
»t6 or' cbming from Boston College,
- each by his lonesome, but yet with-
. 'ing a short 'distance 'of one another.
Would not any one of these like to
talk,, exchange views on; collegiate
or other matters, converse with the
others? Undoubtedly. ' And when
asked, what defence do they offer
for not.speaking with the others?
The feeble plea that they are not ac-
quainted. “Yes,” they say, “no
one has introduced, us.” •
As if B. C. men need formal in-
troductions! -How ludicrous! As
.Horace says: -.“Spectatumadmissi
risum teneatis, amici?” <
According to good etiquette we
: should not speak to those to whom
we have not been formally intro-
duced. But every, rule admits of
an; exception. So in this' case we
claim'exeihption and say that the
students of. Boston College need no
introduction by,a third person; they
may and can surely introduce them-
selves... Can we not go to a fellow
collegian- and say “Howdy. I’m
John Brown of Freshriian X.” Then
.you can say in answer, “I’m Jim
- 'Smith of section—of such and such'
a class, etc.”
/ ■ We have no “frats,” for in real-
ity we.need no “frats.” The whole
college is one big brotherhood, with

every: preparation possible was
made by our students to extend a

AT ALL OF THEM.
South Bend has some good bills
of theatrical entertainment this
week. .	,
.“Three Wise Fools,” at the La
Salle, is a clever little comedy, of
three interesting old men, one
pretty girl and one young man.
“Dream Street” has been much
razzed. But only practical minded
money seekers would razz this en-
tertaining fantasy.
■ “Little Old New York” comes to
South Bend with a reputation. It
is a Hearst production and Hearst
knows how to please the people..
Jack London’s “Call of the Wild”
has or has pot made a good movie.
1 (Report later.)
. The vaudeville acts and the mov-
ing picture, “.Thundergate,” at the
Palace, are all well-done.
AT THE OLIVER.
The word “Griffith” and the word
“good” both start with a “g.” To
< say that “Dream Street” was pro-
duced by D. W. Griffith is to infer,
because of what Griffith has already
done, that “Dream Street” is a
good picture. It is.	/
It is more than that; it is dif-
ferent. “Dream Street” is one of
the few fantasies that have been
/ filmed. Fantasies are dangerous,
though beautiful. So many people
are sure to call them silly, and are
sure to attend such performances
and , laugh-—when they should be
out in the practical air of a bust-
ling street filled with practical po-
licemen, practical' trucks and; prac-
tical construction workers making
... for, loud practical progress.
Thomas Burke is much like J. TM.
Barrie. He creates characters that
are simple, poor, but soulful and ap-
pealing. In doing this, he exag-
gerates. ‘ Perhaps exaggeration is
necessary-for the presentation of
such work; it is hard to say./ At
any rate the characters that the
two men create are the kind that
do things that .make it necessary to
carelessly rub your hand under-
neath your eye now and then, for
somehow a tear is there. • '
“Dream Street” is a.- Thomas
Burke story., ...It tells about Gypsy
Pair (Carol Dempster), a dainty
little . dancer ' who is loved by a
dreamer, Billy McFadden (Charles
Emmett Mack), and the dreamer’s
brother,.. Billy McFadden, a proud
boxer, “Spike” (Ralph Graves).
(That is, “Spike”- was proud and
^thought that- the girls could not re-
sist him until he was repulsed by
.Gypsy.) - The love story is delight-
ful, and progresses through a series
of adventures.	' /
Parts of “Dream Street”, are
cheaply done—comparatively speak-
ing* . Once upon, a time .two. big
companies, one run by Mr. Ince, and
:°rie by Mr.-Griffith spent much
nioney in. producing pictures that
didn’t, pay. because the small towns
' -'couldn’t afford them, and the big
towns couldn’t run them long
enough .to make the dollars roll in
ln. the proper proportions,, But
those - days. are. past. Some ’of the
backgrounds - in “Dream' Street”
are obviously stagey, and some of
the insets that would have been
acted by. great troupes of actors
with especially prepared settings,
a^e> in this picture, but painted
slides. A big difference, but it can’t
be helped.
AT THE PALACE.
Although. Robinson’s Elephants
are.good, -much better than one ex-
acts, and much better than most of
Us have seen, they are hardly the
feature of the Palace program f ;r
the first of this week. The program
Is Well balanced. All of the acts
hre good..
< Vaida, a pretty dancer,- opens the
Pegram. She knows how to dance
“nt she likes to whirl. ’
Vaida prepares her . toilette on
the stage, and when Bertie Herron
aud Donnie Gaylord, in a black-face
act, begin tb change their clothes
on the stage, too, one begins to won-
der if the public toilette is a fea-
ture of every act on the bill. Her-
ron and Gaylord are the weak part
of the bill. Much of their repartee
is old; little of it is really worth-
while.
Florence Tempest and ' Homer
Dickinson, with an apparent off-
hand manner, present an entertain-
ing fifteen minutes of songs and
chatter.
Bert Lahr and Mercedes, late
musical comedy actors, win, per-
haps, the most applause. Lahr acts
as a simple fellow with a peculiar
voice. Mercedes, comely and clever,
sings without sufficient depth, but
she can dance and she can feed
Lahr with the matter for his
cracks.
Owen Moore and Virginia Brown
Faire are the stars in “Thunder-
gate,” a movie of the Orient, in
which Moore ,as a doped American
wakes up as the Lord .of Thunder-
gate. There is the inevitable love
story and much entertaining ip-
cident.
LETTER BOX.
(Continued from Pago 2.)
follows: In attendance at the game
there were many people not con-
nected with the University; and I
heard several of these make re-
marks, to the Notre Dame team as
it withdrew from the field after the
game. I hope and trust that you
will understand that our student
body and alumni have nothing in
their hearts but friendship for No-
tre Dame; and anything objection-
able that happened is not to be laid
at their door. Our students are
simply • dazed after , having read
what your editorial had to say; and
I beg of you, please forgive any-
thing that happened for we were
not a party to it and I add what
our editor said in his article—No-
tre Dame, we are sorry.

. Listen, Tech!
“That’s the way all football
games should, be,” the coach re-
plied. “And don’t forget that we
were up against one of the cleanest
clubs in the country when we were
fighting Tech. I am sorry to . say
that all college elevens are not as
gentlemanly as Tech.”
Two of Rockne’s big aces, it ap-
pears, have been lost, to -the club
through the contemptible practice
of “getting” stars in a cowardly
manner. The fact that the Indiana
players are taught self-restraint
which will tolerate insults does riot
protect them always on the football
field. '	' ..
In one of Notre Dame’s biggest
games this year a member of. the
South Bend club and a foe were
banished from the game as a result
of an apparent altercation. Think-
ing the referee had ruled wisely,
Rockne sought out his player' at
the conclusion of the contest and
ordered the athlete to turn in his
uniform, telling the boy he was
“through.’’
Self-Restraint
The player in question protested
his innocence. Later in the evening
the home player hunted up Rockne.
Evidently the rival man had heard
of Rockne’s action. The player of
the opposing school informed Knute
in strong , terms that his boy had
not'struck back. “I swung on him
and he merely put his hand across
his face to ward off the punch,”
the foeman insisted. Rockne re-

versed himself and the player is
still -with the team.
Questioned as to the amount of
abuse one of his men should take
before striking back, Rockne took
a sort of non-committal mood.
Having been; a star on the grid
himself, he probably knows there
is a breaking point, but he de-
clares that the-sport should develop
self-control commensurate with
physical benefits.
On the subject of endurance and
physical condition, Rockne talked
in an interesting vein. Knute %did
not make a secret 'of the fact that
he is not pleased entirely with the
mood of his club for the Tech game.

“These kids of mine don’t stand
up very well on excessive travel,”
mused the tutor. “I am certainly
glad that tomorrow winds up our
tough* games. Do you realize that
we have to travel 7,000 miles to
run off the 1923 schedule?
“A baseball team may. go through
these hardships without much loss
of effectiveness, but I want to tell
you that football is different. En-
thusiasm is the keynote of the grid-
iron game. The boy with the pep
is the successful player, but he
finds it hard to hold his pepper on

can run along on a winning stride
for a spell through mechanical
play when the morale gets low.
You cannot go far in football
where enthusiasm is at a low ebb.”
Rockne pays a big tribute to Yale
and other great Eastern and West-
ern teams, but he seems to be a lit-
tle doubtful of what would hap-
pen if their sleeping conditions,
water, food and other necessities
of life were mixed into a schedule
similar to Notre Dame’s.

Rockne’s Proteges Accorded Great

Following in the wake of Notre
. Dame’s brilliant victory over the
Tartans of Carnegie Tech last Sat-
urday, are many glowing accounts
of the'wonderful treatment accord-
ed the “Fighting, Irish” in the
Smoky . City. ’Sport .scribes review-
ing, the game that was played in a
sea of mud, were unanimous in their
opinion that it would require all
the superlative adjectives in the lan-
guage to describe the Hoosiers’
. scintillating performance oh Forbes
: field against the Skibos. ■"
' Perhaps :the one feature of the,
' game, that impressedthe . experts
. more, than anything else was :the
wealth of reserve material that com-
posed the Notre Dame contingent.
They acknowledged without hes-
itancy the doctrine of Knute
Rockne, “that a team is as strong
as its relief material.” It seemed
to make no difference how many
substitutions were 'made in the
Hoosier ranks, each man performed
,his duty with an ease and dexterity
that was;a revelation to the thou-:
sands that packed the stands of
Forbes field.
Carnegie Tech, had; met Pittsburg
and W. and J., but they regarded
Notre Dame in a different light—as
a team that could not be stopped.'
In this matter, the East is still at a
loss as to why the Irishmen were
unable to exert their power, when

coln.

■ Doc Connell, the king of Carroll
ball, made a name for himself in
Saturday’s struggle by his 1 sensa-
tional running and scoring of two
touchdowns. Connell made his sec-
ond tally on the first play after a
punt by Robertson had bounded off
the-back of a Tartan player. 'Notre
Dame recovered the ball, which had
rolled to their 20-yard line, and
had the choice of either running
with, the ball or putting it into play
at the point where the punt touched
the opposing player. Tartans and
Pittsburg fans, considering what
Notre Dame displayed on a muddy
field last Saturday, are .wondering
what the Hoosiers would have done
if the field had been dry.
• Two days of rest and Notre Dame
will, take the road for their last
game of the 1923 season. Thanks-
giving Day, the -Rockmen will meet
Coach Rourke’s proteges of the Uni-
versity of St. Louis, at Sportsman’s
park. It will be another game of
Irish versus Irish and nothing in the
order of a set-up, since the doughty
Missourians have met and tied Mis-
souri, who in turn tied Nebraska.
The St. Louis outfit has been, look-
ing forward to the Notre Dame
game all season and St. Louis will
do her utmost to be a most cordial
host to Rockne’s brilliant aggrega-
tion of moleskin performers that so
handily, disrupted the peace and
quiet of eastern football, suprem-
acy and then came, home, to crush
the southern flower from Georgia
