The other evening a call came
from the post office authorities for
jlr. Grundy. Brother Postmaster
said that if Mr. Grundy, didn’t call
^Ore regularly for his mail he (the
p M.) would have to start stacking
’ it up in a corner.

It’s as bad as that. What would
ever have thought, or as of -old,

Dearest Grundy:
’ I -do not want this letter to be
signed. You can have my name
provided you keep it to yourself.
I only wish to cast a vote in the
“Well-Dressed Man” contest for one
I think to be adorable. His name
is Spiller-r-Horace they call him.
I see him so often, but he doesn’t
seem to’ see me. He is a Southern-
er I know, because I once knew
another Notre Dame boy from the
south, and they both talk alike. He
lives in Freshman hall. Please cast
one vote, for me in his favor, and
only sign this letter Goldenrod.

Dear Sir:
• Please cast one vote per day for
me for Robert Conroy Scoggins of
Texas, in your Well-Dressed Man

doesn’t win the contest I’ll be mad.
Hard Times Dance Soon; Class to
Appear in Cap and Gown al
Washington Exercises.
'Senior activities for the remain-
der of the scholastic year were out-
lined by President Donald Galla-
gher at a meeting of the class held
in the library yesterday noon.
The first' event on the program
will be the annual “Hard Times”
dance at the Palais Royale on Feb-
ruary 18. Arrangements for this
event are in charge of John James,
and have been practically completed.
The “Big Five” orchestra, of eight
pieces, will play, and prizes will be
awarded for the best costumes.
The prizes will consist of pillow
tops for the girls and watch charms
for the men.
The only requirement for admis-
sion is that everyone have on the
“Hard Times” regalia and be pre-
pared for an informal - evening.
Tuxedos and full dress suits, ac-
cording to the committee, have been
barred, but Chairman James says
that a student may wear his 'grandr
father’s Prince.Albert outfit. Ar-
rangements for an orchestra are
being made and the one selected will
be announced later in the week.
Presentation of the flag to the
University on Washington’s Birth-
day, February 22, will be the sig-
nal for the first appearance of the
class in caps and gowns. Arrange-
ments for the measuring of seniors
for the- caps and gowns, which will
be rented, have been made. All mon
will be measured in Sorin subway
class-rooms Monday; Tuesday-.-and
Wednesday afternoon of. next
week.	/
The class further adopted the
uniform attire of tuxedo collars,
black bow ties and white shirts to
be worn with the caps nad gowns
both on Washington’s Birthday and

An Admirer,

As way of an interim between
letters of the Well Dressed Man
contest I would like to bring to
your attention—on the extreme
right of our campus -— Freshman'
hall! There are many curious — but
do you remember the letter in “By
Paths” last Sunday, a letter writ-
ten to a girl in Chicago, by a fel--
low in Brownson hall? Well, there
are two gentlemen in Freshman,
who made copies of this letter, and
sent them out in great bundles to
girls whose addresses were furnish-
ed them ■ by - other freshmen in
Freshman hall. And now these two
wen are afraid that news of their
prank will get into the column. We
shall introduce these gentlemen to
you tomorrow—;—maybe!

Debaters Chosen
In Final Tryouts
Debating trials ‘ have been re-
sumed, resulting in the selection of.
a number of aspirants for plapes on
the teams. Both Father Bolger and
Professor Shuster have been work-
ing with their respective groups
and will complete the teams within
a short time.
Of Father. Bolger’s group, debat-
ing the question of comptilsory ar-
bitration of labor disputes, the fol-
lowing men made the team: John
Stanton, Oscar Lavery, Carl Linde-
mann, Seymour Weisburger, Law-
rence Graner, David Stanton, Vic-
tor Lemmer. On this same ques-
tion the following men debate Sat-
urday evening for positions on this
team: Barnabas Sears, John Kane,
Joseph Simons, and John McNamee.
The World Court question, under
the direction of Professor Shuster,
has five men as part of its team.
These are Ray Cunningham, Mark
Nolan, Paul Breen, Ben Pizer, and
Sidney Sider. Others in this group
to go up Saturday night are Clar-
ence Ruddy, I^ert Dunne, Philip
Moore, and Samuel Privelera.
The tryouts on Saturday evening
should close the .series and practi-
cally establish the personnel of the
debating teams representing Notre
Dame this season.

Frosh Discuss Frolic
Plans at Meeting
The ticket sale for the Freshman
Frolic to be given on February 29,
in the Palais Royale, .was limited to
400, at a meeting of the Freshman
class at 12:30 yesterday in Wash-
ington hall. Tickets will be placed
on sale in the near future and will
sell for $3.00.	.
While the sale of tickets will be
strictly confined to members of the
Freshman class, they ■will be open to
purchase by upper classmen if by
a specified time they have not been
disposed of, according to the ruling
made by the S. A. C.
Efforts will be made to secure
permission from the University
Dance committee to have the dance
during the hours of from' 9 to 2
o’clock, though it was the original
intention of the class committee to
continue the affair only until 1
o’clock. The dance will be infor-
mal. Negotiations are being made
for. the services of - a nationally
known orchestra for the event.
Announcement was made at the
meeting that boxes would be in-
stalled in Carroll, Brownson and
Freshman hall into which sugges-
tions relative to the dance may be
placed. ■ It is believed that in this
way many original and novel ideas
will be found.
Joseph J. Reedy, president of the
class,' was in charge of the meeting,
which was the first to be held in
preparation for the giving of the
annual entertainment.
Although the issues decided upon
are subject to change, it is probable
that another meeting of the class
will be called because of the small-
ness of the number assembled yes-
terday.

The Scribblers and Toledo club
forged ahead in the first day’s bal-
loting in The DAILY’S Best-Or-
ganization contest. The Scribblers,
trailing in the morning, received
several votes in the afternoon, and
nosed out the S. A. C. by four
votes. The Toledo club gained an
early lead and" maintained it
throughout the day with 17 votes.
Its nearest competitor is the Chi-
cago club -with four votes.
Voting was comparatively light,'
due probably to doubt as to the
proper method of balloting'. . A
great many votes, however, were
turned in tod late for tabulation.
These will be announced in tomor-
row’s DAILY.
To avoid complication, the names
of the two classes will be changed.
Class No. 1, heretofore known as '
“Sectional, State, and City Clubs,”
will be changed to “Home Clubs.”
Class No. 2 from now on will be
known as “Campus Clubs.” Publi-
cations are not eligible for the con-
test.
As an added convenience, ballots
may be put in the DAILY Bulletin
Box at the entrance to Main build-
ing. .	.
The following rules must be ob-
served throughout the contest:
(1)	- The ? contest will close ’ at
noon Monday, January 28.
(2)	Ballots should be sent ad-
dressed to Contest Editor, Box 21,
or brought to ballot box in the
DAILY office in the basement of
Walsh hall or DAILY Bulletin Box
at entrance to Main building.
(3)	,, Only one vote will be al-
lowed a student for each issue.
The results of the first day’s bal-
loting follow:
Ball Men Consider
Entertainment Plans
An important meeting of the Sen-
ior Ball committee was held Tues-
day noon, to discuss tentative plans
for entertainment, during the week
of the ball. The possibility of a*
Notre Dame-Minnesota baseball
game, May 22 or 23, and a possi-
ble track meet.with the Illinois Ath-
letic club met with approval.
The Music committee is . already
in touch with a number of big or-
chestras, and good, music for the
ball is assured. No favors' have
yet been chosen, but a number of
ideas have been submitted.
The date of the ball was definitely
set for May 23, possibilities of pro-
viding entertainment being, better
on that date, than at any other time
which was considered.
The Ball committee is in need of
ideas, and men from other classes,
as well as seniors, are asked to sub-
mit suggestions.

Ample provisions have been made

And then there is jazz. The term
itself grates like a file. The thing
signified by "the term’ affects one
like a dull day in November, or like
the novel that is called “Main
Street.”... But the comparison is yn-
just to any day or to any street.
For the dullest day and the dreari-
est street have a beginning, a mid-
dle, and an end. These attributes
give them a certain individuality.
—o—
Jazz, has neither beginning, nor
end. It is all middle. And there-
fore it expresses nothing. To try
to discover an idea in jazz is .like
trying to imagine how heavy virtue
is or how far one might go beyond
the confines of space. The mind
simply cannot .go forward, and
hence, soon finds itself enveloped in
a blur.
were ever leading you to expect that
they would take on some definite
outline, would furnish you with
some definite impression,_ .but they
never did. Jazz is unicellular mu-
sic, and the cell is as empty as an
attic.

CORDUROYS AND CAKE-EATERS
-No man is less ivise than when he argues.- Exaggeration and
diminution are common faults of the man heated by dispute. On such
basis can we excuse some bombastic statements. Who, in a calm mood,
for instance, would say that the mere ownership and occasional use of a
tuxedo was a fault? Or, on the other hand, that the wearing of cordu-
roys and the careless spitting of tobacco juice was a virtue? A man
need not scorn the tuxedo and am occasional dance, nor need he don
corduroys and spit tobacco juice, to be a Notre Dame man.
If he is careless of his dress, scornful of others’ rights, inordinately
proud of his physique, to the development of which he pays more at-
tention than to the development of his mind, at least in a cultural way,
he is surely so much less a Notre Dame man, so much less the proper
man for a university, which, we are told, is an institution for mental
development.	■ .
But, on the other hand, if he wears gaudy clothes, proper :according
to the latest issue of Vanity Fair, if he misses not a dance of the select,
if he scorns the roughness of sport and watches from the safe sidelines
where he is protected by the girl who accompanies him, if he is a
poseur, and delights irf perpetually displaying himself in" the hotel
lobby, he is even Jess. a Notre Dame man. One would-call this ' man
_(spare the mark)..aTop?a..dandy, or, as is said.nowadays,; a “cake-eater.”
Notre Dame has- no room for’ the man of haughty mind, he who
mistakes the idea of a university, who devotes too much time to the
development either of .physique or social standing. Notre Dame wants
neither the narrow-minded and broad-limbed Hercules, nor Endymion
caressed by the foolish Selenes and in danger of other. attentions by
meh. /	•	.	..
—o—
We said that jazz was all middle.
It always will be all middle. It can
no more progress beyond that,—
we shall not say point, but circum-
ference, than many of our modern
dances can outgrow a wiggle. For
not having any point to start from,
it cannot have any to go to.
—o—
We once heard a traveler’ say that
looking down from the heights of
an Italian mountain town upon a
team of those huge white oxen of
the contadini drawing a plow, he
beheld the best example ever of-
fered of the line’ of -demarcation
between motion and rest. One
could not grant such a compliment
to jazz. For motion and rest are
at least two positive things. The
best that we can say of jazz is that
it is music at the vanishing point,
i. e., music entering oblivion.
■ • -	—o—
A scientist once showed us
through his microscope certain ani-
maculae which he said were • uni-
cellular. Like jazz, they too were
all middle. Like jazz also - they
—o—
But people listen to jazz. There-
fore there , must be something to it.
We counter: people lister to jazz
because it’is inflicted upon them,—
and because they are polite. Peo-
ple applaud jazz. Hence they must
be pleased with it. Yes. A child
also is pleased with a rattle. We
concede that jazz is rattling music.
—b—
It may not be generally known,
but we are reliably informed that
jazz is not native to our soil. Still
it is notoriously evident that it has
become thoroughly acclimated. It
was first discovered in a South
American cabaret. With us it has
penetrated even to university audi-
toriums! It’s a far cry'. . . . but it’s
a fact. Now let the educationists
spring to. the defense—or the at-
tack.
--0----
It is said that when Orpheus
sounded his lyre the very ghosts
shed tears, and Sisyphus sat on
his rock to listen. At the sound of
jazz one-—anyone whose soul has
ever been stirred by the strains • of
sweet music—-wonders whether the
ghosts of Beethoven or Bach, Wag-
ner or Hayden, do not -also weep,
not glad tears of joy for the tri-
umph of their . art, but salt tears
of shame that those who love music
patiently tolerate, such a travesty
upon it. • .	’
_—0—
Jazz is like Sisyphus roiling his
rock up the hill, and then rolling it
right up over again. If like him it
could ever sit down on a rock to
listen—to some real musi&—it
would be delivered. It would find
salvation, and be forever silent.
THE NOTRE DAME STADIUM
At the present time there is a.boom for a Notre Dame stadium,
has been pointed out that the seating. accommodations at Cartier field
-are insufficient for the annually, increasing number who attend the foot-
it
ball games here on the campus. It has further been pointed out that a
stadium would take care of this difficulty very well, besides bringing
Notre Dame up to the standard set by other universities in this respect.
’ _ Before rushing into, the stadium proposition ft might be well to
consider just one little point. Are we really ready for.a stadium? ‘ Has
our university reached that stage in its development where a stadium
would be a logical thing, as well as that.which is most needed?- ;
Why must a university the size of Notre Dame hold its basketball
games in a Y. M. C. A. gymnasium not half large enough to accom-
modate the spectators?. ..We think that a gymnasium worthy of the name
would be more to the point just.at present. And then, after that has
become a reality, perhaps a stadium.'	.
University Library Statistics are Not
/ True Measure of Value to Student
. .. Of what service is the library to
the student body of Notre Dame?
' At first thought it appeared that
the only way of gauging the serv-
ice rendered by the Lemmonier Li-
brary would be by consulting' the
book of facts concerning the circu-
lation. An examination of this vol-
ume reveals some interesting things.’
Since the opening - of the circu-
lation department in mid-Septemb.er
; ~ until the Christmas holidays only
3,500 books had been distributed?
If this rate of circulation should
continue until the end of the semes-
ter thetfe will , have about - 4,700
books distributed among the 1,800
students. ■ -
Of the 3,500 books carried out of
' the library to date ovej. one-third
are classed as fiction. The authors
in greatest demand are Chesterton,
Stevenson, and Kipling. Jack-Lon-
don and Frank Spearman take lower
rank, not so much because of lack
of popularity as derth of volumes,
' by these authors on the shelves.
Books dealing with sociology came
next as a .class; forming about 10
per cent of the book circulation.
Text books on'history and science
are next in demand, each making
■* up about 5 per cent of the circula-
tion. The remainder, cover a mass
of-subjects.
This was the brief story gathered
concerning the circulation. But that
little statement concerning the cir-
culation' rate per student still
rankled. If the Lemmonier Library
was being used by students so spar-
ingly it was failing in its purpose.
For once, however, -the book of
facts was not telling the truth; at
least not more than a: fraction .of
it. For the average student the cir-
culation department renders. the
least service, the majority of them
finding, more of interest and. of
value in the reference and periodi-.
cal room. The appreciation of the
library may be seen by the number
of students .found in these rooms
every day.	■?..

ILLINI POETRY, 1918-1923; : Edited by
, Bruce. Weirick. Covici-McGee Co. $2.00.
; “With Masters, Lindsay, Sand-
burg, and Sarett,” .begins the in-
troduction of-this anthology of Illi-
nois University poetry, “Illinois has
in the last ten years had the good
fortune, to give, to American letters
;perhaps half the good poetry which
the .decade has-produced?’. This by
Bruce. Weirick, the editor of the
volume, a young man who will some
jlay be known for his poetry, per-
haps, but never, in the light of" that
statement, for his mathematics.
Illinois poetry lends Jtself grace-
fully to the anthologist; the voices
'of her singers blend well together.
The result is a chorus of consider-
able , volume. This is probably
what Mr. Weirick meant by his in-
troductory statement. His col-
leagues and predecessors have ' the
faculty of achieving the same dom-
inant mystic, not in their songs
"which swells the whole into a sort
of chanted chorus sweeping over
the grassy plains from Urbana like

Don’t Wail About It
Write About It
This is your column
The DAILY is not responsible for any
- cts or opinions expressed in this depart-
Lnnt ' Contributors writing anonymously
must let the editor-in-chief know their
eal names; otherwise their letters can-
not be published.
Editoi’ of The DAILY:
May I offer a word of sincere
congratulation to the writer (or
writers) as well as to the staff of
the DAILY on the appearance of
the feature called “The Turnover”?
The first article of the series, an
unusually attractive treatment of a
well-worn theme, immediately com-
manded one’s attention. It was,
• however, surpassed by Sunday's
contribution which, in my opinion,
is the best that has so far appeared.
In sustaining the exalted tone and
readability of these discssio'ns your
contributor . is proving himself an
essayist of no mean calibre.
The DAILY has more than justi-
fied its existence if the students of
Notre Dame' find >themselves en-
couraged to produce writing of this
excellent quality, for it is all too
seldom nowadays that one meets
with. anything but the trivial and
the flippant in popular college pub-
lications.
Faithfully yours,
WILLIAM H. BUCKNELL.
Editor of NOTRE DAME DAILY:
" I have just read a letter in the
DAILY signed by one “Endymion,
’24.”
In a burst of bravado, Endymion
inquires if .there is anyone who
would care to submit a real defini-
tion of a cake-eater. I will try to
give one.
A cake-eater is a person wearing
male attire' but having' a feminine
point of view (apologies to the fe-
male). He is always dressed up in
the latest vogue, Stacomb on the
hair,; faint fragrance of far flow-
ering flowers emanating from the
kerchief, the .use of the corset for
the form and the rogue on the
cheeks being optional.
" . Re takes no*violent exercise, vio-
lent exercise being- uncouth, but
confines himself to the.fox trot and
golf. . He takes none of the re-
sponsibilities of student leadership
in any capacity except socially, but
as a social leader he is a “hound.”
At a social function he ajways^car-
ries, a hip flask and when talking
to his own crowd becomes partially
intoxicated from just carrying the
flask, but become very sober im-
mediately again upon meeting a
prefect or chaperon.
He may or. be may .not pay for
the orchestra of the dance hall or
for. his last suit of clothes, but he
ahVays pays ;his gambling debts.
He thinks he is a breaker of femi-
nine hearts, whereas in reality he
gives people with common sense,
and his, own father and mother, a
distinct pain.	'
Sincerely yours,
RED-BLOODED, ’27.
Editor of The DAILY:
I noticed in your issue this
morning, interspersed among the
various dance notices, a letter from
one “Endymion, ’24,”• and I take
this time to write to warn the Notre
Dame men not to be too rough with
Endymion.
There was a time when the Notre
Dame man went to about four or
five dances a year, wore old clothes
between times, studied hard and

At the Palace,
The acts on the Palace bill this
week bear a striking resemblance
to the little girl with the proverbial
curl in the middle of her forehead.
If they are good they are very, very
good and if jhey’re bad they are
horrid. After feverishly checking
up on th score-card of acts we get
this result: Very good, 2; fair, 1;
poor, 2. The score by innings fol-
lows.
E. Merian and his dog actors
come first on the program with a
number which is pretty good for
an animal act. As far as we’re con-
cerned, however, any exhibition
featuring our dumb friends ap-
proaches absolute zero in enter-
tainment.
Raines • and Avey are just fair.
(He comes out, and then she walks
past, him with her nose in the air
and he says “Ah there!” and—well,
'finish it for yourself.
The Five Dancing’ Co-Eds (count
’em) in our1 opinion don’t quite
climb into the fair class. One of
the. number is'good but even that
dosn’t bring the act up to par.
Last week we brazenly confessed
a weakness for good blackface
comedy. Here we are again with
O’Neill and Plunkett, two real art-
ists of'the burnt cork. Why say
more?
Jules Buffano has an orchestra
which will keep him in good vaude-
Mlle for some'time to come. He is
igenerous with his selections, and
spices them with many pleasing
novelties. This is a fine act and you
will like it.
The moving picture, which is
called “The Barefoot Boy,” is a
pleasing little story that turns out
just as you knew it would in the
first reel,

played hard, and as alumni they
are eminently successful. There is
another school on the north shore
north of Chicago where the boys
acquire polish, social graces and
very little else, and their alumni
willapologize and tell you that once
upon, a time it used to be !a man’s
school.	..
. But how, boys, don’t be too rough
on Endymion. It is true that you
may'be in doubt as to whether to
slap him or kiss him when you meet,
hjm at a dance or in the lobby, but
don’t- laugh when he talks: to you
about social graces. It is the only
excuse “she” has for living.

When we were being urged to buy
canes and wear them we were told
that they were to be the distinguish-

I therefore move that the seniors
in addition to their cap and gown,
carry their canes at the exercises
to be held in Washington hall next

be to see 280 Notre Dame men of
the class of ’24 march into Wash-

canes.” -	.	.	.
One other suggestion. .The style
of the present cap and gown is ob-
solete, it seems to me, and does not
uphold the “traditions” of such a
progressive class. . Why not have
blue .and gold \ caps, and stylish
pinch-back, or English, cut gowns
modeled after the suits the boys
who do come and those who would
like to come from back East are
wearing.
Yours for progress,

Prof. Cooney Gives
Views About Daily
Professor John M. Cooney, head
of the department of Journalism,
yesterday gave his views on the
DAILY. Professor Cooney said
that while he appreciated the fact
that news was scarce here on the
campus, the DAILY should make an
effort to cover the field more care-
fully. He realized, however, that
the staff had to do this work as well
as class work and therefore could
not give it all their time. He pointed
out that the DAILY carried a great-
er proportion of features than the
average metropolitan daily. The
Scholastic, he said, was for literary
effort. Mr. Cooney said that some
of the complaints voiced in the col-
umns were foolish. He pointed as
an example to the complaint about
the state of the campus after rain.
In speaking of Notre Dame and
the field of journalism, Professor
Cooney said that he had heard from
Frank Wallace, Journalism ’23, now
on the staff of the Associated Press
in New York. According to Wal-
lace a Notre Dame club is being
organized in New York by some of
the old students, including Jimmy
Carrolyn, now on the New York
Times, John Balfe, “Red” Murphy,
Cletus Lynch,. Al Ficks and others.
Wallace stated that he considered
New York to be the newspaperman’s
kingdom.

Marquette beat Iowa, Iowa beat
Purdue and landed second place in
the conference race. Wisconsin
■ took first place in the current run-
ning.
Michigan beat Illinois and Notre
Dame beat Michigan. Minnesota
beat Notre Dame (first game), In-
diana.beat. Minnesota and Creigh-
; ton beat Indiana. Butler beat Chi-
cago after having been defeated by
Franklin. The dopesters are due
for a hard winter, and just now are
figuring it out that if Notre Dame
- beats Franklin, the Irish will be the
greatest basketball'• team in the
country.- Then the dopers turn to
Creighton,- which will meet Notre
Dame later, and' take note of the
fact that the Creighton school
crashed through Iowa and beat the
Haskell - Indians, another phenom-
enal basketball five, and wonder if
Franklin could beat Creighton.

Rockne’s best dash and distance
men as well as several entrants in

The Illinois relays were founded
by the Illini track coach, Harry Gill,,

gained in popularity until last year,
when all previous records for en-
trants were broken. More than 500
athletes from 43 schools appeared
in action in the Urbana indoor

Carroll Hall Team
Wins in Elkhart
The strong Carroll hall basket-
ball five won, 20-15, over Ma-Ha-Di
Grotto team, of- the Elkhart city
league, in a fast game played in
Elkhart last night. Starring for the
local basketeers were Dahman and
Maxwell.
The game was close until the
final period when Carroll ran away
from its opponents. For the great-
er part of' the play the score was
first in one team’s favor, then in
the other. Although Carroll was
handicapped by the absence of sev-
eral regular players, it displayed
the form that has kept'it unde-
feated so far this season, and
showed good team-work.
Carroll and the Ma-Ha-Di Grotto
formed the main attraction of a
double-header series. • The strength
of the Elkhart aggregation may be
judged by the fact that they had
previously defeated a. strong Y. M.
C. A. team of that city the night
before.
With the advance indications so
favorable, it is certain that Carroll
will be one of the strongest con-
tenders for the Interhall title. Car-
roll will met Badin, tomorrow in
what should prove one of the most
interesting games of the series.
Hockey Team Leaves
for Pittsburgh Games
The Notre Dame hockey team left
for Pittsburg Thursday night,
where the fast Pittsburg Athletic
club sextet will be met Friday and
Saturday. The team has shown
marked improvement since the re-
turn from Ann Arbor and should
give a good exhibition of the puck
game.
The Pittsburg team is made up
of former college stars who live in
and around Pittsburg. Carson, cap-
tain of the team, captained the 1921
Yale hockey aggregation; Schoen,
Humphri, and Patterson are former
Princton stars, and Ingles is a for-
mer Ottawa College hockey player.
Two games will be played, both
with the Pittsburg A. C. One Fri-
day? night .and ythe~ other Saturday
night. The games will be played in
the Duquesne Garden Indoor Rink.
The Notre Dame Alumni of Pitts-
burg will be on hand to support the*
team..

GAGERS ARE READY
Final Preparations Made for Sea-
son's Tests Keogan's Men
Drill Intensively.
' With a return of the old flash
and form ,as displayed in the Loy-
ola game last Wednesday night,
the Notre Dame basketball team
has made the final preparations for
the season’s test with the Franklin
College team, who appear against
the Fighting Irish on the “Y” court
tonight.
Aftei- having fallen into a slump
for two games after the Wolverine
classic, the Notre Dame eagers ex-
hibited a reversal of form in the
last game and are now conceded
more than a fighting chance to' win
from “the best team in the middle
west.” Coach Keogan has injected
into his men all the court science
that has been developed in the his-
tory of the game, and will send his
men into, the game tonight with all
the necessary tools in their power
and then leave it to the Maylmen
to make the best of the opportun-
ities that fate or'brains will create.
Franklin college has a veteran
quintet under the tutelage of a
coach who worked with the same
combination in hjgh school he is
now directing in' college. Griz
Wagner is a master mind in basket-
ball^ but it must not be forgotten
that he has exceptional material.
Wagner has seven or eight men
who have made a thorough and tire-
less study of basketball for the past
four years and the Franklin people
attribute the phenomenal success of
their team to this factor, and not to
the so-called fate that many sport
writers have Been led to believe is
following and guiding the Frank-
lin. team. ,
The Franklin players are all bas-
ket shooters of the best ability, and
are dangerous from any part of the
floor and during: every minute of
the game. The Baptists have a
pair of forwards that are hard to
beat; anywhere- in the country.
Vandivier is undoubtedly the bas-
ketball sensation of the year, one
of the best forwards ever developed
and he will merit the close attention
of every man on the Notre Dame
quintet tonight. Gant, who teams

A “Yellow” .
with Vandivier, is another phenom-
enal basket shooter and a reliable
man on free throws.
. C. Friddle will mean a busy even-
ing for Tom Riordan, since the Bap.
tist center is a very tall man anti-,
an extraordinary player. Gifted
with plenty of speed and the abil-
ity to handle the ball with great
skill and dexterity, Franklin’s pivot
man will be a game all by himself
since he is almost the equal of the
forwards when it conies to dropping
the ball through the mesh. Ballard
working at running guard, may
cause Kizer some little trouble, but
advance dope paints' him as the
smallest running guard playing col-
legiate basketball. However, if re_
ports, from Marquette and Wiscon-
sin can be relied upon, the size of
Billard is in no way a detriment to
his effectiveness.
Captain Wood holds down the
guard position and is the only one
of the regular combination who did
not play with the others in hi^h
school, although he came from the
same school. Wood compares fa-
vorably with the others on .nikin?*
the ball through the much sought-
for net	,
Notre Dame will have a defense
suited for the visitors, which will
.call for the highest type of team
work and each slip will be a chance
for the visitors and dope say.? that
they are hawks for openings.
