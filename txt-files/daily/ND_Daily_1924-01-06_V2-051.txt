Northwestern Handed Drubbing,
But Illinois Wins From Our
Basket Team.
Displaying the best form that has
been shown by a Notre Dame, bas-
ketball team in past years, the Irish
five defeated the University of
Northwestern quintet 25 to
the “Y” floor, Wednesday
December 19. '•
Speed, accurate shooting,
16, on
night,
and a
masterful defense were the high
lights of the game that impressed
the huge throng that packed the
gym. The flashy Clem. Crowe lived
up to expectations and dazzled the
visiting team by the ease. with
which he dribbled the ball through
its defense. Tom Riordan starred
at center, piling up a large point
total and displaying some pretty
basket shooting.
Due to their great speed and
their ability to weave through the
Irish defense for short shots, the
Illini defeated the Notre Dame
quintet 29 to 21, last Wednesday
night before a large crowd at the
Urbana school.
The Illini took a big lead at the
start of the game,- running up 12
points to four counters for the vis-
iting Hoosiers. Captain Mayl and
his men rallied before the half was
but and the count stood 14 to 11 in
favor of Illinois at the start, of the
second frame.
The. Maylmen continued their
pace in the next period and-came
within one point of tying the score,
which stood 21 to 20 about the mid-
dle of the last half.. The Illinois
cagars./reeled off eight.; points in.
quick succession .and. succeeded in
holding Notre Dame till the final
whistle.	-

Rockne Is Declared Dean of All
Coaches by Los Angeles Writer
By MARK KELLY
Writer in 'Los AnSeles Examiner.
Eckersall officiated the Haskell-
Olympic game, here Christmas. It
was in his dressing room that we
encountered him and got an earful
of football How-down front back
East. Among other things, “Eckie”
was told that’ Knute Rockne was
coming to'Southern California next
summer to instruct coaches.”
“That’s smart headwork,” said
“Eckie.” “Knute Rockne stands out
as the greatest coach of offensive
style in America. He is the ‘Hou-
dini’' of the forward pass. There
may .be others who know a bit more
about defensive play, but I doubt
that , too. I believe that Rockne
makes his defensive tutoring sec-
ondary to his offensive schooling.
The best answer to the question of
this system’s merit is.Rockne’s phe-
nomehal.'success at Notre Dame.”
The Army Game '
. “I officiated' at the: Army-Notre
Dame game. It was a revelation
of the.possibilities of the forward
pass. The Notre Dame players gave
the Army- the worst drubbing of
that good eleven’s;history—no,t per-
haps in points, but'in the convinc-
ing way in which they trimmed the
Cadets. So swift, so deadly, and so
precise was the Notre Dame passing
game that the Cadets were not only
bewildered,, but dumfounded and at
a complete loss for an adequate de-
fense.',; ... -	;	. .■ '

Farrell Rates Notre Dame as Nation’s
Best Football Team of Past Season
When conditions exist that make
it impossible to pick a football team
that is the champion of its own im-
mediate neighborhood, it is much
more impossible to get any line of
comparison that would permit a
team to be selected as the national
champion.
Nothing but harsh words would
be the reward of any critic who took
upon himself the thankless task of
even expressing an opinion on what
team was the best in the country.
The matter of expressing 'the
opinion is nothing compared to the
obligation of the burden of, proof
that would rest upon the critic who
would venture his., own opinion.
Under the conditions it would be
better to place the burden of proof
upon the other side and approach
the subject like this:
Notre Dame Great Team
“What team in the country -was
better, than Yale?—California?—
Michigan ?—Illinois ?—or Cornell?”
And even with ample preparation
for the comeback: .“They were de-
feated!”—it might be in point to
ask:
“What teams over the season were
better than Notre Dame or Syra-
FR. WALSH SPEAKS
TO FT. WAYNE MEN
Speaks of Changes at University
During Pasi Years; Breen Medal
Donor Present;
Seventy-five Notre. Dame alumni
and students were entertained at a
banquet given by"the’ Fort* Wayne-
Notre Dame Alumni association at
the Keenan hotel on the night of
December 27.	.
Rev. Matthew Walsh, president of’
the University, was the guest of
honor; he talked on Notre Dame
and alumni associations. Father
Thiele, pastor of St. Peter’s Church,
spoke a few words. Father Hogan
was toastmaster. \
- Father Walsh gave examples of
the . good done by alumni associa-
tins. He said that Fort Wayne.had
one of the most active alumni or-
ganizations. He traced the devel-
opment and showed the changes
that have come over Notre Dame
during the last half century.
Father- Thiele’s talk centered on
reminiscences of the days he spent
at Notre Dame as a student. '
. William P. Breen, donor of the
Breen Medal for oratory at Notre
Dame, and one of the leading at-
torneys of Fort Wayne,, was pres-
ent. -'He is the oldest Notre Dame
Alumnus in Fort Wayne. Tim Gal-
vin of Valparaiso was also present.
Several excellent musical selec-
tions were rendered by. the Hayes
brothers. • • _
The committee 'in charge of the
banquet was Clifford Ward, chair-
man, Ed Lennon, John Eggeman,-.
Joe Haley, and Frank Hogan. ”
cuse?”
Stepping around the fact that
football teams are judged upon
games won or lost, we -will assume
all risks attending the guess that
Notre Dame would defeat any team
in the country with the possible ex-
ception of Yale and a Notre Dame-
Yale game.would be a feast for the
football gods.
Notre Dame was not beaten by
Nebraska. Notre Dame was upset
by her-own schedule. Considering
the. greatness of Yale, California,
Michigan, Cornell, Illinois, and Syr-
acuse, we do not believe that any
of these teams could duplicate the
feat of-Notre Dame in beating the
Army, Princeton and Georgia Tech
on successive Saturdays.
Games like that take the sap out
of any team, not considering the fa-
tigue that cannot help but attend so
much travel on the road. Prince-
ton did not have a great team, but
Princeton, took so much out of the
Harvard team that Harvard was
hardly in . shape to play-two weeks
later with an off-Saturday inter-
vening and Princeton played justas
hard against Notre Dame. .

DRAMA CLUB HAS
NEW DIRECTOR
"One Act Plays to Lead to Big
Presentation in June,” Says
Director.
The Notre Dame Dramatic club
has been augmented by securing
the' services' of a director and re-
hearsal man, Joseph Reynolds, of
Lawrence, Mass., a graduate of the
Leland Powers School, and it is
making preparations for a busy final
semester. Mr. Reynolds, who will
work in conjunction with Professor
Sullivan of the Department of Pub-
lic Speaking, has been very active
in many dramatic circles during the
past few years; Since 19,20 he has
been affiliated with- the Federated
Lyceum Bureau, having read in 26
different states in the East, South,
ai d Middle-west.
At various times while acting in
the capacity of a juvenile, he has
been associated with some of the
prominent* theatrical companies, in-
cluding, George M. Cohan’s, George
G. Howland’s, a Boston stock com-
pany, and the Colonial Players of
Lawrence, Mass.
Mr. Reynolds, when told that the
first drama meeting of the new year
would be. held tomorrow night, ex-
pressed his desire to meet and be-
come acquainted, with all of the
men .interested in dramatic art.
When asked what plans of pro-
ceedure he had in mind, he said:
“We will endeavor to produce some
one-act plays which we hope will
lead up to a big. final production in
June. We have not. decided as yet.
on,, any particular plays, but - this
much we can assure—an. active
Drama club. The "plays we shall
select will, we hope, instill into the
student body a worth-while appre-
ciation of dramatic art, similar to
its appreciation of clean sportsman-
ship.”
At .the Drama 'club meeting to-
morrow evening in the library
Reynolds' will elaborate on
plans for the remainder of
school year.	z

NOTRE DOME WINS
OVER M. U., 29-25
Irish Gagers Set Fast Pace for
Wolverines; Visitors Fail to Over-
come Lead in Overtime Periods,
Notre - Dame’s Fighting Team x
playing the most brilliant brand of
basketball that has ever been wit-
nessed on the home court, defeated
the University of Michigan quintet,
29 to 25, on the “Y” floor last night
before a packed house of 1200.
With the score tied 19-19 at the
end of the regular playing time, the
Irish' cagemen battled for two over-
time periods after Kipke of the -
Wolverines and Ward of the Irish
tied the count again at the end of
the first overtime period with bril-
liant shots from the floor.
With only a few minutes of the
regular playing time left, Kipke
scored on a pretty shot from the
middle of . the floor that.gave the
Wolverines a one-point lead. The
referee declared a technical foul
on the Michigan captain for Laving
six men on the floor, while the game
was in progress. Kizer, who proved :
his worth at the crucial moment
during the 1923 season, lived up to
his reputation and scored. on the
free throw, making the count 19-19.
Shortly after the overtime period' K
started, the flashy Kipke, Michigan’s ■ .
All-American half-back, raced down
the side of the floor and dropped a
basket, giving Michigan a two-point
lead. The time was almost cut and
with Notre Dame fighting desperate-' .
ly for a shot at the basket, Mayl
passed to Charlie Ward, who drib-
bled around the Wolverine defense
and tied the score.
—<The — second--.overtime -period, -
found Notre Dame; fighting . harder
than before, and in quick-succession '
chalked up four goals due to the
superb playing of Kizer and Ward.
Michigan fought with every ounce of :
strength that was- theirs after the
long gruelling battle and succeeded
in ringing another pair of counters,
that raised their score but failed to -.
head off. the safe lead of the Mayl-
men.	~
The Wolverines played a fast of-
fensive game in the opening frame
that would have proved very damag-
ing had it not been for the supreme
work of Kizer and Mayl at the
guards and Riordan at center. The
shooting of the Michigan cagemen
was erratic during the first few
minutes of play, but gradually set-
tled down as the period neared the
finish. The work of the home five
also slowed up due to tha terrific
pace , at'the start of the encounter
that gave Notre Dame a comfor-.
table lead.
The bitterest battle raged during,
the first overtime period when the
Wolverines threw, a scare into the
Irish camp on Kipke’s goal from
mid-field. Team work was almost
forgotten as each man made the
most of his chances for a* goal..
Several times Kizer missed the steel
ring by inches , on long and short
shots, but . the Michigan five were
desperate and fought viciously to
stem'the Irish attack.
Haggerty, one of the leading for-
wards in the Conference, was the
high point' man’ of. the. Michigan
squad, being credited with four
goals and two free. tries. The di-
minutive star from the Michigan
school played a wonderful all-
around game and proved to be one -
of the most spectacular shots on the
floor. Kipke at running guard and
Captain Birqs at center were big
factors in Michigan’s near victory
during the entire game.
The stellar work of Kizer, Crowe
and Ward will be hard to equal dur-
ing the rest of the seasonj and con-,
isidering the wonderful' defensive
and offensive work of this -trio,
Notre Dame will be assured of a
brilliant scoring combination for .
the remainder of the schedule. Mayl.
and Riordan displayed some pretty
defensive work against the/ fast

A HAPPY YEAR . .
Once upon a time- it was considered fitting to address a friend
with that friendly greeting, “Happy New Year.” That simple day
has passed. You no longer wish your friend happiness, or joy; you
wish, him instead something more happy than happiness, and some-
• thing more adorable than God—you wish him Prosperity.
“A Prosperous New Year.” Our scientists and philosophers have
' - discovered that happiness is a myth—and so far they may be right—
but they have gone beyond that mere negation and solemnly announce
prosperitv too modern to be mythical, and therefore /a thoroughly suc-
.cessful substitute for happiness. Yet even the scientists are hoping
that prosperity may bring them some' of the old-fashioned brand of
' happiness. '	,	,
In everything but in our souls we'are realists. We want the
truth on sex, on hygiene, on rotten politics, on pig-iron and pigs—:we
want the truth on everything, but Truth.. Therefore we dodge the
eternal truth that happiness can only be a.state of the soul; we hope to
find-it in money or motor cars, in liquor and lingerie; we look for the
:	bluebird in every foreign house of fantastic shape, while the real little
- bluebird is crying itself to death, unheard, in the plain, chambers of our
_ soul.	• /_
We wish we were modern enough to wish you ali a Prosperous
New Year. But there are fairy tales in our head, and in our heart a
feeling that'all the Prosperity in the world is not worth two Pokes at
. a Pickled Potato—not that we know what a Poke at a Pickled Potato
- '	■ is, but to us it sounds every so much more soul-satisfying than Pros-
. penty.	A
' Anyway, we hope that you may look into the mirror of your heart
many times during 1924, and discover there contentedness, or happi-
. "ness; from our Confucian viewpoint (which is much more-Christian than
. that of many Christians) it doesn’t matter a fig if you are prosperous
or not. - '	:	- .	-
Education has its funny side,
even though professors are proverb-
ially serious, colleges connected
with profundity of thought, and
students, supposedly at least; pre-
paring themselves for that most se-
rious of businesses^—life.
One funny thing—it also has its
tragic side—is this: students come
to the University to get an educa-
tion.
What they'want, except for
a few details, is definite enough in
their minds. The means are put
into their hands. They realize the
singular opportunity which is theirs.
But there they stop—(we do not
say how many)—and the joke be-
gins. They begin to slight the op-
portunity, to put obstacles in ^the
way of realizing it, to imagine that
because they have once flirted with
it, they may run off and it will fol-
low them. Is it not, as'the French-
man says, to laugh, this daily spec-
tacle of students (the word is used
in a- purely material sense) in the
business, as it were, of studying, of
pursuing wisdom, having to be urg-
You can lead a mule to water,
etc.—but students are not mules.
The poor mule, whose reputation
suffers, in the proverb, probably did-
n’t want any water just at that
time. But they do. They came just
for that. And when the very
springs are pointed out, yes, at
times,. even when the cup is raised
to their lips, they refuse to drink.
That stringent regulations for cuts
are necessary, that books gather
dust on library shelves, that benches
are turned into .beds, that much of
the teacher’s energy goes in the
form of a tax to be allowed to con-
fer on them a benefit,—all this but
heightens the’ comedy.
' But the most comical part of the
whole proceeding is that they fancy
the joke is on the professor, or on
the .school, or on somebody else,
while all the time it is on them-
selves. For the joke is always on
him who must pay the fiddler. They
pay, but refuse to dance. And that
is why it is funny.
How explain this inconsistency?
Whom shall we blame? It would
be. a satisfaction just to be able to
fix the blapie. We have pondered
the matter deeply, and after long
and serious consideration we have
deemed it prudent, if not very pro-
found, to fix the responsibility on
that dear old patient culprit, hu-
man nature. And so we close with
the paradoxical advice to those who
need it: Quit being so human, and
get to work.	.

WRITE A PLAY
- ’ The Daily questionnaire, presumably the pulse of opinion on the
campus, was more than ordinarily interested in December 16 issue. Ev-
ery man questioned on the subject stated he personally would prefer
to'see plays produced in Washington hall that were written by Notre
\ Dame men, rather than to see standard plays written' by outside
authors. ‘ From the sentiments expressed by these men, we may infer
that the entire student body feels the same way about it. ' '
That much is settled. Now all we need is someone to write the
play. Who’ll do that?.	,
' We have a great deal of literary talent; our publications are tes-
timonials, to that. Some of our short story writers, some of our poets,
might turn their hands to play writing and try their skill in that direct
tion. There is no reason why we. shouldn’t have two or three plays
produced here on the campus during the present school year that are
, entirely the product of Notre Dame. Other schools do it as a matter
of course. -	'	- ■	'

; THE PERPENDICULAR PRONOUN
Some one who was doing a lot of thinking once said, “If there
. is anything that-pleases me it is myself.”’ To date there have been
no books published about this ever fresh and .interesting topic—they
are not needed. A school of two thousand people has just exactly
two thousand -living, breathing books on this very topic. A nation of
one million people has one. million such potential books. They are all
different, but they are all on the same subject. • .
.. Two larger classifications,'however, can be' made. They are:
: Firsts those that deal totally with self for self’s sake. Second, those
thirt^deal with self, not for self’s sake alone, but also because of other
®elfs- T^e second division is the only one that is worthy of mention.
. The keynote of it is consideration. . Those who belong to it are pos-
sessed of many blessings, a fair degree of real happiness, and many
. friends. This second group has almost everything that the first group
. has not.	■	°	1
' ' Now belonging to the first group does not involve any inconven-
jences, nor is its membership at a premium. . On the other hand, mem-
bership in the second group, although it involves sacrifice, pays well.' '

Dame Verse.” The Scrirbblers,

There is an irresistible note of
youthfulness in this book, a touch
of the spontaneity and idealism of
young hearts. It is a unique col-
lection, admirably selected and pre-
pared. Poems of love, of happiness,
of sorrow, of the battlefield, are in-
cluded .... a meritorious array of
verse. . Here one finds the joyous
cry of glad youth; here the pathetic
appeal of a grief-laden heart.- A
wide range of choice-characterizes
the collection. '	•
. Any "attempt to select, the .most
deserving poems is difficult. , The
shorter ones are excellent. Among
these are “Happiness,” by Frank B.
Summerville, and “Reverie,”. by
Professor George N. Shuster. In
“Meeting,” by Speer Strahan, there
is a; strange beauty, distinct and
noteworthy. “Renewal,” by D. P.
H., gives a brief but clear flash of
new-found, joy. J	.
, Two poems of the light-hearted-
ness of youth are “Au Large” and
“Song/’ by Vincent D. Engels.
“From This Hill,” by Owen P. Staf-
ford, contains an impressive vein
of pathos that stands out and re-
tains a place in one’s memory.
. Perhaps the most/Inspiring con-
tribution of all is that remarkable
poems, now well-known in this ter-
ritory, .“For George Gipp.” There
is genuine poetry/ in this. The
beautiful conclusion to Gipp’s life
is portrayed here with extraordinary
finesse.	. .z .

Although Willa Cather is the au-

“One of Ours” ’ appeared that she
became known to a wide public and
was recognized by the ■ more' dis-

INK WELL
The Editor, NOTRE DAME DAILY:
I i feel that the readers of the
I pAlLY will be interested in learn-
f ing of the success of a former Notre
I Dame man in turning out a victor-
i’ jous team, and am therefore giving
i you a brief account of the work
f Jone this season by the football
i tcam of St. Edward's College, a
team coached by Jack Meagher, a
former .Notre Dame end.
..“Playing its third year of college
football, St. Edward’s College, the
•Notre Dame of the Southwest,’ met]
and defeated some of the best teams
I jn Texas and Oklahoma, and passed
through an undefeated season,
j scoring .147 points to their oppo-
nents’ 18.
“The season was opened by de-
feating the strong North Texas
Junior A. & M. College, 13-0.. This
was followed by a hard-fought game
with the Baylor University Cubs,
who' were defeated _7-2.. Then
Tulsa University of Tulsa, Okla.,
submitted to a trouncing, 35-7.
This was followed by a game in San
Antonio with Army All-stars com-
posed of the pick of the army men
sationed there, including several
former West Point players.. The
I ‘Saints’ won 14-0.. St. Edward’s
then met and defeated Simmons
College,.champions of the T. I. A. A.
This was perhaps the most thrilling
-game of the year, being won in the
last 20 seconds of play by a drop
kick from the 40-yard line by Nie-
.mic, the triple-threat star of the
‘Saints.’ The score was 3-2.
Daniel Baker College was then
smothered, 48-0. On Thanksgiving
Day, before the largest crowd of
the year, St. Edward’s met Phillips
University of Enid, Okla. Phillips
had for two years been champions
; of the Oklahoma conference, and
! was for several years a member of
I the Southwest conference, having
^atjme time defeated Texas Univer-
i sity; They outweighed^St.' Edward’s
20 pounds-to the man, and were ex-
pected to stop the victorious sweep
of the ‘Notre Dame of the South-
west.’ However, they proved to be '
easy prey and were defeated 27-7.
“The St.. Edward’s team is ably
coached by Jack Meagher, a former
Notre Dame end. The system
used at St. Edward’s, both in the
• classroom and on the athletic field,
is that of Notre -Dame, the mother '
house of; the religious order con- '
ducting the institution. As • the ;
spirit of Notre' Dame prevails in all '
things, it is nd wonder that its foot- '
ball team should be a winner.”— i
Daily American Tribune.
If you can give space to the '
above, I feel sure that it will be i
interesting to many of your read-
ers. Cordially yours,	1

To the Editor,
NOTRE DAME DAILY:
According to the figures recently
I published in the DAILY, as given
out by the business manager, Fresh-
man hall stands far in the lead over
all the other halls in the percentage
of DAILY subscribers. ,The lead of
Freshman hall is particularly no-
ticeable when its percentage is com-
pared with that- of the high and
mighty seniors of Sorin hall. It is
these same seniors who are contin-
ually exhorting the lowly freshman
to exhibit' the ‘ol’ spirit’ by backing
Notre Dame enterprises, but here
we have one more proof that when
it comes -to spirit the freshmen have
more of it than any other class has,
and much more than the seniors
have.k Come on, Sorin! Organize a
pep-meeting for yourselves for
once. You need it more than any-

business transactions, and lavish
with his hospitality. Through the’
story moves Marian Forrester, his
wife, exquisite, fascinating, some-
what irresolute, but equally cou-
rageous in her moments of weak-
ness and of strength.
It was Joseph Conrad or William
McFee who remarked that few
women are supremely lovable; as a
woman Marian Forrester was a fail-
ure, but she had the unquestioning
devotion and loyalty of two men;
of her husband who understood all
her foibles and her more serious
failings, and of Neil Herbert, a man
many years her junior, who idolized
her.
A modest volume, this, one that
can easily be read in an hour and
a half/but it is one. which is a val-
uable contribution to the great
number of novels which take up
one phase or. another, of the growth
of the west.—J. B.
“The Banner of the Bull,” by Rafael Sa-
batini; Houghton Mifflin Co,, Boston, New
York. $2.00.
Bizarre characters have ever had
an attraction for the more sober
members of civilization. The pirate
has been for a long time a favorite
figure with readers of all types and
the reason is not far to seek. How-
ard-Pyle, who knew more of pirates
than any man of our day, says that
their attraction lay in the fact that
they knew their own minds and
what they wanted.
Cesare Borgia, the hero of “The
Banner of the Bull,”, cannot be call-
ed a pirate with any degree of his-
torical accuracy, but he has one
thing in common with them. If
ever a man knew his own mind, it
was Cesare^ and he had no scruples
as to the means employed to gain
his ends. About him there has al-
ways lain an atmosphere of attrac-
tiveness,'notwithstanding the fact
that he has come down through
history notorious rather than fa-
mous.	'	~

Kennedy and Lieb
In Irish Olympics
Notre Dame will be represented
at the Irish Olympics in Dublin by
two of the greatest track stars ever
produced at the University, when
Paul Kennedy and Tom Lieb join
the Irish-American team in August
to compete in the latest track clas-
sic to be established for universal
competition.
Paul Kennedy, captain of the
1924 track team and one of the
best milers, in college ranks, will be
entered in the distance runs to com-
pete with Irish runners from other
parts of the world. Kennedy, who
was also the mainstay of the Notre
Dame harrier team for two years,
has been running the mile in 4:25,
but’ considering the condition of the
Irish leader this year, his mark is
due to be slashed several seconds
to a 4:21 pace.
Tom Lieb, who will enter in the
discus, has been one of the most
consistent performers in the field
events and a versatile trackman of
the highest type. Lieb won the
state title in 1922 with a heave of
147 feet, 4 inches. At the Na-
tional Intercollegiate games in Chi-
cago last summer, Lieb defeated
Pope, the I. A. C. star, with a heave
of 151 feet, 6 inches.

THE RUB DOWN
By TOM COMAN	. .
One of the country’s leading
sport critics recently brought to
light a splendid example of the value
of athletics from a point other than
the glory achieved on the playing
field.
Captain Hammer,. leader of the
1923 Pennsylvania football eleven,
“experienced one of the bitterest
trials that could possibly come to a
football captain who was completing
his college “football career. The
Penn coach decided that Hammer
should warm the bench during the
last game of the season. The same
fate was meted out to Captain Dan-
' iels of the Southern Methodist Col-
lege, but he accepted it in a differ-
ent way than did Hammer—which,
says the sport critic, manifested
the wonderful lesson learned by one
man and disregarded by the other.
Hammer, brokenhearted and dis-
couraged, -turned in his equipment
and left college. Daniels sat on the
' bench for the last two games of the
' season, rooted for his .teammates,
and 'declared that the “sub” who
had taken his' place was easily1 a
better man and asked the team to
- "give the “sub” their. support in the
last game.
•. ~ .Both men faced the same situa-
tion, but the Texas leader had
learned the lesson of self-sacrifice.
Women -are the silent powers in
■ the baseball world. 'Witness the
case of Urban Shocker, St. Louis
star, who balks at the rule of the; others were generally believe to be
Missourian’s club that prohibits his j the cat’s pajamas of football coach-
wife from accompanying him on ing. In 1923 Rockne made the wide
wife from accompanying him on
baseball trips. Some ball clubs
have no rules in the matter, leaving
it to the decision of the player as
to whether or not he wishes to take'
his wife on the trips.
Several of the eastern clubs pro-
hibit the presence of the player’s
wife on the trip for the reason that
the wives of players'are apt to cause
dissension in the club by discussing
the work of the players on the
field.	'
Bob McAllister, “the flying cop,”
became famous in the New York
Athletic club last year as a sprin-
ter, while he was a member of the
police force. McAllister left the
_ realm of the brass buttons and de-
voted much of his time to running.
' But unknown even to his closest
friends^ the . speed merchant. had
many varied talents of which they
. * were unaware. The lure - of the
concertj stage ; prevailed over the
glory, of the-cinder path .and now
Bob, who was carded to compete
against some of the greatest speed
' stars .in the country, has announced
his intention of withdrawing entire-
ly from athletics to make a living
by singing.
"It is a notable fact that many of
- the country’s star athletes who
gained fame in their college days
and continued their work after
- graduation have been forced to de-
vote so much of their time to poor-
paying sports that they were obliged
to carry a little side-line occupation
in order to buy their daily bread.
The latest dope from the higher
। realms of sport reveals the fact that
. - athletic bodies do not approve of
their star athletes using their skill
and reputation for money-making
purposes. This brought to light the
case of William Tilden, America’s
- - greatest exponent of tennis, who
■ has been writing articles on the
game for various newspapers and
magazines throughout the country.
Tilden is riot alone in this work and
.several other7 stars'who are doing
SCHOLARSHIP DANCE. '
The first Scholarship dance/of-the
year will be given at the Palais Roy-
ale ballroom, Monday evening, Jan-
uary 21.

the same thing will have to face the
same ban.
The United States Lawn Tennis
Association announces the fact that
the old ruling on this subject will
be renewed and that Tilden will
either have to quit writing or give
up his amateur standing. '
A southern sport -writer,, com-
menting on the matter, was not un-
mindful of the fact that the writ-
ings of these men were not bought
for their literary value but that
their monthly check from the syn-
dicate was the answer to the ques-
tion, “What’s in a name?”
ROCKNE DEAN OF COACHES
(Continued from Page 1.)
“Passes from every conceivable
formation, passes hurled with dead-
ly accuracy from any angle; passes
that were short and passes that
were long; always pulling the un-
.expected. Notre Dame on’ that day
was the finest scoring machine I’ve
ever seen^since the pass came back.
“Southern California coaches who
fail to take advantage of Rockne’s
course here are making a big mis-
take.”
They Take Notice
Rockne, ■ until this year, wasn't
generally credited. with being the
capable citizen he is. Haughton,
Heisman, Harlow, Warner, Tad
Jones, Wilce, Stagg,. Zuppke, Dobie,
Andy Smith, Yost, Bezdek, Fisher,
Folwell, Roper, Spears and a few
wide world sit up and wonder what
manner of man: he was.
Gone is Haughton’s pre-eminence.
Percy may know a lot of football,
but to-date he ,has not shown that
knowledge to others. Heisman can
pep up an alumni with his theories
of football but cannot turn out an
eleven that wins.
Rating of Coaches
: It leads us to a point whereby we
attempt to rate the country’s lead-
ing coaches on their-achievements.
Consideration is given to the handi-
caps" this'man faces and the ad-
vantages this man enjoys. So with
fear and trembling we rate the Na-
tion’s football mentors thusly and
invite a broadside from any one
with a better selection:

NOTRE DAME BEST TEAM
(Continued from Page 1.)
Yale, • we feel, would beat Cali-
fornia, Michigan, Illinois arid any
other sectional champion,. because
Yale was smart, could kick, pass
and run, and Yale had eight half-
backs that could make any ’varsity
team in the United States.
' No team without two sets of re-
serve backs of greatest ability could
hope to keep up with the speed of
the Yale attack, and Notre Dame
was the only other team that had
sufficient reserves of all-around
class to do it.
California has a great team.
There is no question about it.
In four seasons California won 33
games, .tied two and made 1,737
points against .88 points for its op-
position. That is some record and
could have been made-only by four
truly great teariis. >
California had one tie game to
spoil its record this year, but that
game, was-won because Andy Smith,
the coach, arid four or five of his
regular players, went' to scout an-
other team on the same day.- •
Cornell’s Great Record ’
Cornell in the last three years has
made a great record that would
have entitled it to a ranking with
the very best teams in'the country,
but Cornell has . seen fit to pick
easy, going and, untiL Cornell de-
cides to show itself against some
really good teams, the record will
be nothing more than good-looking;

alty of being dropped from the list
of the season’s best by losing one
game, so also did Syracuse, which
deserves to be rated as one of the
season’s best teams.
There is also Marquette, which
hasn’t lost a game in two seasons
and which has defeated teams just
as strong as Cornell.' There is
Pittsburg to be upheld as one of
the most illustrious teams in the
country,K because Pittsburg is the
gamest team playing football.
