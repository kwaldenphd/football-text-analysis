dents. The purpose of. the magazine
is: stated in an' editbral in. the'. first

ury in 0:09 9-10, the time'in. the

ST. VIATORS WINS
OVER KEOCANITES
IRISH NINE SUFFERS UNEX-
PECTED DEFEAT,
11 TO 6.
KANKAKEE, Ill., May 17; (Spec-
ial)—An unexpected defeat .was
handed to the Notre Dame baseball
team when the St. Viators slug-
gers fell on two Irish pitchers for
an, 11 to 6 victory here this after-
noon. . .	.'
The Kankakee aggregation start-
ed out with a crash and'hammered /
in three runs in the first inning be-
fore Notre Dame came to bat. The
three run lead was cut down by
the Irish in the /third frame when ’
Dundon was touched for three runs
to add'to the one. counter hung up
in the second inning. From then
on, the St. Viator southpaw held.
the Irish in 'check while the home,
crew nipped the visiting twirlers
for eight more runs./	- /.<
The fourth inning marked the
downfall of McGrath on the mound
for' the Irish when five runs were —
scored on four hits and Stange took •
up the burden, with one out. The
locals . added another cqunter be-
fore\the/inning expired. .
St. Viatbrs^completed its scoring .
in' the seventh’ when/ with two men
on the path, J. Winterhalter con-
nected with a 1 home run. After
Notre. Dame’s sensational victory
over, Illinois, the St Viators nine
expected a killing for the Irish/but '
the smart ball playing of the day
before was lacking.

'	‘ YESTEMAY’S BULLETIN .	‘	,
. Because it is in the nature of an editorial, the bulletin issued,
yesterday morning by Father Matthew Walsh, president of the Uni-;
versify, is published in its entirety in tliis column:	• -	J
“It has been rumored that the Ku Klux Klan is to hold some*
'sort of gathering in. the vicinity of . South Bend, this evening. There,
.is also a rumor to the effect that there maybe a parade of the Klan
in South Bend. .	- .
“Notre Dame is interested in the proposed meeting of the Klan,
> but not to the extent of wishing to interfere with, whatever plans
may- have been~ maderfor va/demonstration-. -Similar attempts of the-
Klan to flaunt its strength have resulted in riotous situations,-some--
•times in the loss of life. . '	.	-	’	:
' “However aggravating the appearance of the Klan may be, remem-:
ber ’ that lawlessness begets lawlessness/ Young blood and thought-,
' lessness may' consider it a duty to show what a real American thinks;
of the Klan. There is only one .duty that presents itself to Notre;
Dame men, under the circumstances,‘ and that is tej ignore whatever
demonstration may take place today. • This suggestion should be taken;
in all seriousness. It is my wish-that the Klan be ignored, as they,
deserve to be ignored, and that the students avoid any occasion of
■ coming into contact with 'our Klan brethren during their visit to;
;South Bend. Letzthe .South Bend authorities take care of the situa-:
tidn. The place for Notre Dame men, this afternoon and tonight,;
is on the Notre Dame .campus. An injury, or even serious mishap,•
to a single Notre Dame man would be too great a. price to, pay;
for a protest, which , in the nature of things is unnecessary and highly:
undesirable to the. authorities of both the University and South Bend.”;
STANDARDIZING. '	*
. ; . ' ' ' ■ ■ - •• - '■ . ’
The costs of producing the'Dome^ increase every year/ . As long1
/ as improvements, are made Jn the book^ this is inevitable. Part of;
.ther'increased; cost; is met. by ' increased returns from advertising and;
. circulation^. but there are some means of saving that may be suggested.;
One of these is standardization of the cover.
’ The cover design of the 1924 Dome is simple, tasteful, and attrac-,
- ’ tive. Some such a design, possibly in the orthodox blue; and gold,
and including—as seems desirable because of/the name—a design:
of the dome, might, be chosen as the standard; coyer of the book/
. . . This Js dont! by other schools, among them Illinois. . It will effect
an. annual saying of time and money, and it will provide a uniformity;
in’ the* appearance pi .the book,/ for those who , collect several during
y ,their , years at Notre Dame. ..	.	;
.We, suggest, this; idea to the S. A. C. and to the new; editors of:
the. Dome* Now is a. good time'to decide. •	'
• - -	' ; -	, REVEILLE. .
Nothing:* is more'.pleasant than to awake, in. the early hours of
^tliese .pleasant days.'. The soft beams and warm breezes that, come
'ih ^yoiir 'window are much more pleasant means of arousing than:
alarm clocks and prefects. It is a temptation to lie there lazily in
the soft glow, to doze off again, and be roughly awakened later when
the glory of the early morning is passed.	;
. But the day is, begun when ;we make 'thei effort needed to get
.out of bed, and wander aimlessly out onto the campiis to make our
slow way around.‘the -lakes'. The head is clear, and' the . pulse be^ts
1 temperately. The/odors are fresh and inspiring. Our day, is begun
well with an exhilirating sense of both physical and mental joy.
One of those “meanest men” is the, -fellow who 'parks his car
/ in the space designated for two.

, MAKING FRIENDS
At the beginning of the term and
especially at the first Fall term,
we have an opportunity. to make
friends. -Friendships formed in col-
lege are the.friendships which ben-
efit us most, for here we are on
equal terms with, all those wi.th
whom we associate. We are all
interested in studies, athletics, uni-
versity activities:.in fact, nearly all
our interests are common. When
friends are on the same level they
really know each other and can ac-
quire the ability to judge person-
ality. . -
• There is one danger in making
friends, and that is that we may
make too few of them. Sometimes
groups are formed in which the sut-
dents enjoy the companionship of
each other but forget that there
may be a few who were- left out
of any group.	•
' Perhaps those who are most apt
to limit their number of acquaint-,
ances are the students who were
in school recently and have return-
ed. When they, come back they
greet their companions of the year-
before and proceed to spend all
their leisure , time with them, ne-:
glecting to meet new. students. /
Whether we come under any of
the classes mentioned or not, we
can all do considerable more get-
ting acquainted than we have thus
fai* this year. 1 Remember one thing
—a: person can never have too many
real friends?—The'Carnegie Tartan./
OVERLOADED WITH JUNK :
A note of especial interest has
come to light with the announce-
ment of Simon L. Nye,. president
of/the American Booksellers’ As-
sociation, speaking at the Associa-
tion’s twenty-fourth convention. in
New York, that top much' “new fic-
tion,”: mofet of -it unworthy of a
prominent place in the home li-
brary, can be attributed as the cause
for the prevalent slump in the book
sales of the country. It is a note
of particulajr. interest because it
demonstrates 'most clearly that the
reading public is on the verge of
a revolt. .	. .
, For a; number of years, beginning
immediately after the war, there
had been turned out of the presses
of the country countless numbers
of novels' of this “new fiction”, type
that were wholly' useless’ and ab-
surd as works. of 1 art. /Not that
alone, but they actually served to
lower the taste and demands of the
readers. The markets were loaded
to overflowing and the mind of the
public flooded with sensual and de-
basing thoughts. This type of novel
continued to be written and sold,
unabated, and even today it con-
stitutes by far the greater percent-
age of . the/ novels printed. But’
with this' announcement, it. begins
to look as. if tbe pendulum is about-
to begin its. backward- swing, the
swing to normalcy. -	■ ' . ;
Every day in- the United States
sees three' hundred new novels
thrown into the hands: of the read-
ing public. Of these approximately
two hundred and ninety-nine are
not / worthy of even being aopenecL
They are - for the most part stories
that deal with sex and various forms
of vice and crime in a way wholly
exaggerative of .life. These books
fall into the hands of the younger,
folk who do not understand what
is attempted: to bp brought before
the reader. ~ New and fresh illusions
of a nature - that is very harmful
are created in the minds of these
persons. Not few in number <are
the evidences - of the concrete in-
jury resulting from such reading,
and it is therefore a most gratify-:
ing thing to hear; that less, and less
of these novels are being sold.—

Many Here to Visit
Library Last Week
What Others Say
During' the past week the uni-
versity library has had many visit-
ors. On Wednesday the art class
of the South Bend High school paid

ing the art collection of Notre

the fifteenth century. On Friday

Keoganites on Edge
for Big Ten Games
With four conference victories to
their credit, the Fighting Irish ball
club will have only a few hours rest
before the next big assignment on
the 1924 card. The Iowa baseball
nine will arrive on Cartier field
Tuesday afternoon, to accomplish
two objectives. The > lowans will
J endeavor to wipe out the stain of
the sensational defeat handed to
them at the end of twelve innings
of perfect ball playing last year
and uphold the honor of the con-
ference, by inflicting defeat on the
Irish, nine which has so successfully
trimmed four conference schools,
on of which is leading the Big Ten
list. y . .
Coach Barry of Iowa dropped a
game to Illinois last week, and the
results of the, Notre Dame-Illinois
game do not indicate very much of
a walk-away when । the westerners
take the field Tuesday afternoon.
The lowaris are conceded a hard
hitting club always ready to take
advantage of the first sign of
: weakness on the part of the oppos-
ing pitcher. However, a twirler
with his slant making the break in
perfect fashion will not be greatly
embarrassed by the Barrymen at
the plate. / Iowa garnered Psix hits
' in, the Illinois game but went hit-
less during four of the nine innings,
and both the Indian twirlers were
were having a bad afternoon.
, In all probability, Magevney. will
' take'the mound for Notre Dame, if
Coach Keogan decides that Iowa is
the harder' of the two games, Min-
liesota' invading Cartier field on
Wednesday afternoon. With the
Irish veteran on the mound against
Iowa, Notre Dame' will hang up
another victory by displaying; the
same aggressiveness at bat that was.
shown in the Illinois game.
Errors by Iowa were used, to
good advantage by. Illinois . to win.
rEong drives-tbTthe garden-were
twice delayed long enough for two
of the Lundymen to score. Notre
Dame will, present a garden defense
little short of perfect in Crowley,’
Vergara, Farrell and Dunne. , In-
cidentally thife. fielding quartet ac-
counts for a good share of the of-
fensive power of the Notre Dame
club. ;	‘ "	•.
Coach Barry has a dependable
hitter at the top of his. line-up in
Poepsel. The Iowa left fielder
counted for the only home run in
the, Illinois game. Scantlebury in
the short field is another one of
Barry’s powers behind the bat.
' With Minnesota playing here on
Wednesday, Notre Dame will have
an opportunity to hang up a new

Illinois Romps Over
Michigan; 106 to 26
The fates smiled with no little
favor on Harry Gill’s Illinois track
team, when the Indians triumphed
over the University of Michigan.
The final count stood 106 to 26,
and the victory practically decided
thp western conference outdoor
championship for the Urbana school.
The running ’ of the. regular con-
ference meet will do little more
than emphasize the Gillmen’s right
to the title.	,
Michigan took three firsts out of
fifteen starts, not one of the first
places being recorded in the track
events. Broker defeated Brownell
in the pole vault, which did not
come so much as a surprise since
the Indian champion is still suffer-
ing the effects of a wrenched
shoulder. The ailment, however,
did not detract from the perform-
ance of Brooker who is rated al-
most on a par with Brownell. .
Don Kinsey stepped the low
hurdles for a new mark in 0:24 3-5.
Bud Evans was clocked in the 220-
yard dash in 0:21 1-5. Schildhauer
put the shot, 45 feet, 7 3-8 inches.

What They Say
N. D. DEFEATS AGGIES
. CRIMINAL NEWS
In a recent confession, a notor-
ious young female criminal referred
. in an offhand manner, “to her ini-
tiation into the habit of taking other
people’s purses and belongings” and
. said in part “she had been reading
I details of such things in- the papers,
and while doing so had conceived
. . the notion that it was feasible to
get a considerable sum that way
in a short time.”
‘	= It is not putting it too strongly
to 'state that the stories of crime
printed in the daily newspapers
, - teach no worth-while lessons. They
do, on the other hand, give instruc-
. tion in countless details of -criminal
. practice. Some phases of crime it
is true ought to be aired. But,this
• is not the explanation of the mo-
tive underlying the publication of
' the crime news ah the ordinary
papers. With the average -daily
newspaper the motive for the print-
ing of crime news is nothing more
' or less than a willingness to pander
to the instinct of morbid curiosity.
' The, responsibility which the
v newspapers owe to thp public is far
greater than is .ordinarily reepg-
. nized. When one. considers the in-
- • fluence; which mental' suggestions
7 exercise, upon the. ordinary, recep-
' tive .mind of the average individual
. it is easy- to see that the common
' practice, of recording, in all horrible
. detailf/a great amount , of crime
. ’ news is conductive to. no good for
individual, community or nation.—*
