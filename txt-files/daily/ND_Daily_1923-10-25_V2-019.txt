INTERHALL ATHELETICS

■	. man; Day vs. Sophomore.
The assertion that Notre Dame men are not evincing the proper
interest in athletics might, at first thought, appear to be a misstate-
merit of fact. Doubtlessly some critics of our University would claim
that too much iriterest is shown in athletics. Yes, as a matter of fact,
a great part of the, student body is indifferent as regards interhall
competition, .	.	' ,	. .
It is easy to enthuse over the varsity because it is always a win-
ner. . The several haU teams naturally cannot all be winners; but
indirectly they help to make the varsity.the consistent winner/ th at it
is. . Sport writers have frequently commented on, the factt that our
football team is strengthened by the development of players in inter-
haU athletics. In view of this, interhall competition is worth presery-
' ing and strengthening.	/	/
" As announced some time ago, the Interhall Athletic Association
has decided to give .^ome emblem to the-members of the team which
wins the interhall football championship. This is indeed a step in
the right direction and should contribute to the success of interhall
//activities/by. stimulating a spirit of friendly, 'rivalry, among those, who
./actuaUy. take, part in sports. .	:	:	/ /	'.'■ '/ I
- But the chief value of these emblematic rewards is that they are
means of reminding the other students of the successful representation
. which the winners have given their hall. And, unless the students
•indicate by their interest during the playing season that.they appreci/-
ate the efforts of the players, the mere possession of. an emblem can
. bring little satisfaction to its winner. If, however, the emblematic
award is accompanied by interest on the part of the hall occupants',
the present year may be reasonably expected to: be one of: real ath-
letic success. ' '	< .	'
CANNED ROMANCE
, Mr. Grundy, local dilletante and man about town, rang the bell
with-the following episode which he so masterfully’narrated in Sorin
.hall Jast week. At o	South Bend dance palaces (which hap-
pens to have neither the approval or. disapproval of the. faculty) he
asked the girl with whom he happened, to be stepping whether,/ by
//any chance, she would Be going home soon and, if so, whether she would
'appreciate an escort, implying that'he was ready-to act in that ca-
pacity right away. z	■
The music had crashed a finale iri one magnificent crescendo as the
'apparently young lady turned full on Mr. Grundy and replied1 in high
/arid haughty tone: “See here, kid,” this with a perilous squint of her
. mascariried eyelash, “was we ever/intrajuced-to brie another ?”	!
. “Really,” reassured the unfortunate colyuriiist, “I can’t say that
L remeinber.” /././ -T	.	■
.; J ; “We^ then, you gotta lotta nerve,” and she .flounced away.///.-, /.
v This, will not be a diatribe on the dance hall; Conditions, which.
. make the modern temple of, jazz—where everybody, is more or less an
automaton for. someone else’s' pleasure—have their roots deep, in the.
. mire of industrialism.	/ /	. 7	. ;	.	•.
-• .(.This Hsrnot an expose ofrthe present industrial order, either. It
represents, an :effort to get Notre . Dame men to: attend Notre Dame
dances. Half the attendance at South Bend dance halls is due to the
lack of other^ places to dance, where: the appointments would be nearly
as fascinating and the music half as alluring. .-	■ ■	'	/
’ The college man does not have this alibi.-There. a.re Notre Dame
.dances every Saturday. - And the' music, we: feel sure/is. as good as
anythirig in the.South Bend, jazz emporiums.,-'In fact yarsit^orchestras

Dear Mama,
I love this place, dear Notre Dame;
To me it seems like'home.
For twenty cents 1 had my name
Inscribed upon the dome.
I’ve paid my pew rent for the year,
’Twas fifty cents you see, : .
And I’ve , been fortunate enough
To buy a night-per key.
Dujarie Hall will give a dance
Nex't Monday night, they say.
Gee, all the fellows think I’m great,
They called me “Goof” today.
Coach Rockne needs me for his
team. .	,
I’ll meet him . in . the gym. .
The co-eds that he’s organized
Want me. They’re asking him.
I took my physical exam
From four nice senior boys.
They gave me pills and one
- .	. marked, ..
“You’re wonderfully poised.”
re-
I’ye rerited me a campus chair
For concerts held next May.
Some student dentist will be ’round
To (fix my teeth today.
But, mother dear, I now must close,
It’s time to go. to bed.	< • , :
For me, kiss daddie, sister,; too,:;

MUCH ADO OVER POLITICS.
Though we may be wont, to cen-
sure arid deplore campus politics in
American uriiversities, - any move-
ment to change it. by injecting
greater factionalism "'and' a party
aspect into student’ politics would
lead to still greater problems. We.
look upon the question- much in
the attitude of “let. bad eriough
alone, for a' change in most prob-
abilities would be for the worse.”
: The old cry of “the best man for
the place”, should be revived, but
riot iri mock excuse for support of
a candidate obviously suited to the
position' simply through favor with
certain forces. It would be a sign
of a healthy, fair political condition
to :have class offices closely con-
tested by several candidates, pro-
viding . the races were made .with
the candidate’s real qualifications
as the, point of campaigning instead
of factional rivalry the basis.
A short-lived popularity, the in-
curring of enmities and friendships,
possible- a senior day speech; and
an ■■■ additional picture' for the win-
ner‘in the', Arbutus Ds -the sum of
what' a- class office means at Indi-
ana uriiversity. It is riot worth the
strife. On the other hand, there are
those who do riot look so lightly on
class honors, and who will go to
cunning ends to obtain-them. Taken
too seriously, campus politics breed
evil aftermaths’. The “man’ for the
place” principle, Or this failing, the
give-and-take method in an honest,
caucus, will fid riiuch of the unnec-
essary friction in the. selection of

‘ paramount has apparently thrown
money into “The Spanish Dancer”
by the bucketful in providing cos-
tumes and sets. The production is,
if anything, a bit overdone, and the
dramatic-value of the story is lost
in a blaze of glory, the like of which
even Solomon never saw. It is real-
ly a pity, when you consider, the
work of art that Ernst Lubitsch
made of Mary Pickford’s latest
play, “Rosita,” based on the same
story.	,
' Herbert Brenon, the director, de-
serves little credit for what success
the picture has attained, because
his material was excellent in the
first place, and his cast, which in-
cludes Wallace Beery, Alfred Men-
jou, Kathlyn Williams,. Antonio Mo-
'reno, .and Gareth Hughes, is intelli-
gent enough to save almost any
picture, however: dull, and “The
Spanish Dancer” is anything but
that.	.
The sets, particularly the repro-
duction of the cathedral at Seville,
and the scene in , which the court
dance is given, although they .de-
tract from the story and make the
witness lose' the thread of the plot,
certainly afford a remarkable spec-
■ taele* ’ ■ •• •	■	*

Those fond parents who send
their sons to the larger colleges, to
acquire learning and more learning,
can look with pride at the Notre
Dame football team’s achievements
in the game with-West'Point last
‘Saturday and realize that their ef-
forts have not been in vain/ True
what the Notre Dame boys showed
was on the-football field and not in
the class-room, but nevertheless the
evidence is there that they learned
their :lessons—-unusually : intricate,
by the- way—very well indeed. =
Any team that can show twenty-,
seven separate and distinct forms
of attack-from , the one formation
and be letter perfect in this re-
spect, is made'up of the right sort
of - young men,., men whose brains
are developing along with their
bodies in the healthy sport in which
they are engaged. If you know
anything at alL about football and
stop and. ponder over what the No-
tre Dame boys did against West
Point—twenty-seven different lines
of attack, mind you, and never a
slip on their part—you’ll agree with
us their brains must be as alert and
active as their sinewy bodies. . .
What They Say
. [New York American]
- . By ARTHUR ROBINSON
The Notre Dame team which de-
feated Princeton - so decisively, on-
Saturday, in the judgment of the
present observer, is one of the truly
great teams of all football history.
No one player stands out above the
others.	.	.
It is an all-star team which in
action clicks off plays with the
sharp, rhythmical precision of West
Point cadets ' on parade. - Pdrhaps
the comparison is inadequate. The
Notre Dame team is also suggestive
of a squadron of swift-moving ar-
mored tanks with high-powered
guns protruding from every turret.
-It is frequently said > of some
games that .the score did not repre-
sent the actual difference between
the teams. This was true of Sat-
urday’s game. Notre Dame should
have had six touchdowns instead of
four. The only mistakes, mechan-
ical as well as physical, which Notre
Dame made involved two fumbles
close to the Princeton goal. Each
time Princeton recovered. .
' Aside from this, we believe that
Notre Dame played well within the
limits of its resoruces' and full
greatness, especially K so since, a
week before, the team had played
the Army and had made two round
trips between the east .and South
Bend. The schedule asked a great
deal of the westerners—geography
imposed a- heavy burden. But No-
tre Dame was equal to everything,
and rose high above the' Army,
Princeton, the schedule and two
long railroad trips.
Princeton looked bad against
this wizard team. The first three
minutes of play were’ a nightmare.
Notre Dame’s attack in these three
minutes would have made any
team turn pale. Princeton lacked
Caldwell, its best'defensive player,
and Beattie did not play until late
in the game and then for only a
little while. But the result would
not have been much different if
they .tyad played from the start.
Princeton, of course, will do bet-
ter as the season progresses, but
Notre Dame accomplished its amaz-
ing victory without any special use
of its pet weapon — the forward
Pass. The drive of its running at-
tack, regaled in artful^ twists of de-
ception, was more than enough and
all that Notre Dame- relied - upon.
We suppbse-that Notre Dame mere-
ly “took the game in its stride.” '
" We see an easy way for Walter
Camp tojpick.his all-American team.
• [The New York Times] .
PRINCETON, N. J., Oct. 20.-—
A fighting Princeton eleven went
down to defeat at the hands of
Notre Dame’s superb football ma-
chine.. It was a crushing blow; to
the Tigers after last year’s cham-
pionship season, but a blow which
only added further glory to the
westerners’ already great prestige,
for they, showed the same perfec-
tion of execution and the same ir-
resistible power that carried them
to victory over the Army last week.
The defeat marks Princeton’s first
in two seasons as well as the first
time in football history that the two
teams have met.	<
.. An offense, i probably, surpassing
in' smoothness' and drive anything
that, has ever been - seen in Palmer
stadium, accounted for four touch-
downs’ for Knute Rockne’s charges.
Notre Dame’s shifty backs left lit-
tle to choose between them, for
each seemed equally able to gain
around the ends or on off-tackle
smashes, but Layden, Crowley and
Miller shared the glory with Stuhl-
dreher, the quarterback, whose gefi-
eralship left little to be desired.
For briefness, the game could be
told in the number of first downs,
with Notre Dame’s overwhelming
majority of 22 to 5',. and five more
of the visitors’ came on Tiger pen-
alties. Gains by line" rushes and
end runs netted the westerners 241
and 155 yards respectively, against

when they did they executed it -with
a precision which was deadly. On

its winning as in the possibilities
of, such, elevens as Georgia’ Tech,

HOMECOMING PLANS RUSHED.
Layden Out Georgia Game; South-
• erners Have Great Triple Star;
Rockne Molds Defense.
When the Golden Tornado from
Georgia Tech meets Rockne’s Fight-
ing Team on Cartier field next Sat-
urday, football fans in this part .of
the country are going to see one ,of
the best games on the home sched-
ule, regardless of comparative
scores.
The Tech gridders, offering a ver-
.. satile attack of mixed running and
pass plays, will endeavor to combat
the strategy of Knute Rockne by
7 one of the ■ most unique ■ shifts that
has' ever been executed on a north-
ern football field.	-'
-	The. Southerner’s battle formation
calls for a concentrated attack, in
. which each man in the line and
back field shifts with the count of
the quarter back. . With this prob-
lem to be solved by the Irish war-
riors, Rockne is drilling his men to
meet this attack with a stone-wall
defense.
Another department that is be-
ing stressed in practice sessions on
Cartier field is- tackling. The Geor-
gia Tech ball toters are a fast, hard
running. bunch and will depend on
their terrific driving game to hold
up their end of the score next Sat-
urday. ,; • : ‘ •
Once more, Notre Dame will
stack up against a team that far
•outweighs her, both on the line and
in the back field. But the resource-
ful Rockne, working.with an eleven-
man teamj composed of speed arid
brains, will have something new to
offer to the critical football' world
that will be on hand next Saturday
to-see how the Irish, pigskin chasers
!pluck the petals from the southern
flower.j ......... .	- . •
Although Red Barron, possessor
of half a dozen All-American berths,
will. be missing from the Tornado
' ranks this year, the' Tech school
’, has a.triple-threat.mah iri .Wyckloff,
who has been spreading a reign of
terror in the Cotton country foot-
ball, teams since the season opened.
The lines include several veterans
'.that faced tthe Irish warriors last
.year, when Rockne sent his crew
of Fighting Irish through the much-
heralded Tech team to the'tune of
13 to 3. Captain McIntyre, Fry
and McConnell are all veterans in
the forward wall positions. Albright
is another great hack .operating with
Wyckloff behind the line.; Stattori
is a! fast erid arid Hunt, at the quar-
ter, job, is an experienced field gen-
■- eral. - •’ ■„ .-	. ■
The Irish gridmen will be with-
out the : services of Layden, and
,7 Rockne will depend on Cerney, En-
‘ right and Livergood to uphold the
full back job. Max/Houser, who
has been showing great form in
. punting since the team returried
from Pririceton, may be called upon
to do most of the kicking in the
game: Saturday...	,	. 7 .	/
