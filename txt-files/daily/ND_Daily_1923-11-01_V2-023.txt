/ James Swift; .> chairman of the
S. -A. 0., Yesterday issued the fol-
lowing statement in regard to the
$2 admission fee:- '
. . “There has been some comment
qri‘ the campus relative tb the mat-
ter of a two-dollar charge for the
S. A; C. ’ Homecoming Celebration
Dance. In • .explanation of this
charge,. .it may.,be said that, this
dance provides, the only source of
revenue possessed by the S. A.; C.,
and. that throughout each year that
organization finds itself obligated
to a rather, great extent for matters
beneficial and necessary to the un-
dergraduate body..; This : fact, . in
conjunction with that of .-added ex-
pense of the .Palais, Royale as com-
pared to other'halls, has ^made the.
measure necessary/ It is hoped that
the individuals will cheerfully accept
this' immaterial ’ additional'.expense
in view of. the above.”

THE BROWN JUG
... With Homecoming and its welcome inflow of happy and enthusi-
astic old boys. the.brown jug is apt to be in evidence.- Notre Dame
is no different from any other university in this respect; it is no dif-
ferent from any other group anywhere in the supposedly arid United
States.' '■. ■■	;	■’ ■ ■	'.	''./"•
But the excuse that ^others do it” is no excuse. The Student
Activities Committee. and the University officials , will , do-all they can,
in- those few .days to prevent drinking from the little brown jug. All
of us should back the S. A. C. and the University officials; all of us,
whether we believe in prohibition or not, recognize the evil of excessive
drinking, of drunkenness, and deriounce it.
At Homecoming it is especially desirable that Notre Dame take
a: decided standr agairist drinking by: college men. The country about
/ will be ‘watching Notre, Dame on Friday and Saturday, and Notre
Danie fshould be proud of all she does on those days—as she stands
under the glass of the curious.	'	.	.
.Otherschools, Dartmouth in the lead/have begun decisive war
on drinking of intoxicants. Illinois and others, through their student
councils, have suggested to the men of their schools, that they stay at a
' rational distance from the flowing bowl particularly at Homecoming
time;' Notre Dame should follow that excellent lead. She can begin
with a' Homcoming unmarred by disgusting.exhibitions of drunkenness.
//' WATCH YOUR REP . '
; - “Notre Dame! ,Notre Dame!” Those words are blazing before
the eyes’of the nation/JnJthe greatest burst of publicity .our . school
lias ever been accorded. On the streets/in the restaurant and diriing
room/ in the Pullman and in the frat house, our football team is the
subject for conversation. Naturally the people are wondering what
kind of a school .it is that breeds such a type of athlete.
, , Mr. Lawrence Perry, pfoiriinent sports writer, is. one of those .who
. have promptly conceded to. the public’s wish to have information about
us.; ; In-an-article sent to leading papers all over the country, Mr.
Perry opens the,subject of Notre Dame with the following senterice:
“Notre Dame .professors accompanied the football eleven to Princeton
and . conducted- recitations throughout the trip. This is . the usual
/practice here. .	,
-"/? Of course.it is possible that this was the case., But if /here were
professors1 accompanyirig the team, they must have slept in that rather
unprofessorial space between the berths and the Pullman floor. And
.the'only recitations, of which there is any record .were those panegyrics
delivered by one James Crowley, , who is probably better known as a
football player than as a'professor. Mr. Perry’s' opening statement
'is very interesting, as a dream phenomenon; but pleasing as such a
prospect would be to the professors^ this drearri Has .not as yet become
the “usual practice.”	:
. ’ -.Mr. .Perry states some facts about us that we might never have
- discovered/without his help: Thirty-nine per cent of the student body
is ?non-Catholi(*. Rock’s mien on the practice field is “always quiet.”
And further, you people of the world who;would have the facts about
Notre Dame from a man who knows the facts, the renowned Rockne,
besides attending to the trivial matter of a football team, “coaches
track, baseball and hockey.” 7 ■ ■	?
, > ..Ye shades of Castner!—The -Doriie would, give $3,000 for. a pic-
ture of Rock on <ice skates, taken after a characteristic remark such
as,/‘Jolly well, Milbauer, old fellow—right well done, But gracious,
old'.bean-A-you simply must be careful not to allow our new puck to
become.all slushy,!”. t	•
- J; m Some; of this;inay appear to be nonsensical? It is. But it is not
half as fionsensical.as the world’s notions of Notre Dame may soon be.
With the passing of the years, Notre Dame is becoming inore and more
known. ' It is the duty/of all of us to assist in 'making her . known
correctly arid favorably. Due to the peculiarities ; of some journal-
_ ismmisrepresentation is. common. Mr, Perry, for 'example, surely had
tile1 best of intentions. But he was ruthlessly misinformed; It be-
hdpvek/us'at, this time to be most careful, lest the nation, which also,
has" the- best of intentions, be misinformed regarding us. Let us as
individuals. ,do- nothing T which might be . misconstrued. Let us as .a
studerit-body be diligent,in the minding of our P’s and Q’s, lest we
wake some morning and discover the newspapers’ headlines to be, “The
True: Facts About Notre!Dame! Startling, ■ Sensational Revelations,
as Reported by the Third Assistant; Reporter of Our Correspondent’s
Assistant- Reporter.’// •	<	-

It is more likely than riot that
Charles'Jones will wake up some
fright morning to ..find himself an
extremely popular actor if he con-
tinues the pace at which he has
been going; / He no longer goes by
the name of “Buck,” and he appears
to have been successful in breaking
away from the western pictures
' which first brought him before the
public.
' . His most recent vehicle, “Big
Dan,” concerns a young man, who,
wearying of cpaching prize fighters,
turns his . training quarters into a
camp for boys. He meets a girl, of
course, a girl who has neither a
relative nor a cent in the world,
whom he befriends, and with
whom he eventually falls in love.

telling it is fresh and new.

screen, or, at least is a newcomer
to the’ type; of role ‘which she plays

Army Captain Praises
the Notre Dame Team
/ Denis -Mulligan,. captain of the
West Point football team, wrote to
Harvey Brown, the .Notre Dame
. football captain, recently, speaking
enthusiastically of the Notre Dame
team, and expressing a hope that
its success would continue. The
letter follows: .	/
Dear Brown: •	•<—m
.’Though my congratulations are
belated they are none the less heart-
felt.
. A week has elapsed since the
Irish population of Brooklyn was
lifted to the zenith of Celtic jubila-
tion by your great win and although
our disappointirient at losing has
lessened' somewhat, 6ur admiratiori
for Notre ' Dame,.. Knute Rockne,
yourself arid ' your ' teammates’, has
increased a thousandfold. ' Person-
ally, I’ve lain awake nights paying
silent tribute in my own heart to
what I consider the most polished
football eleven it has been my for-
tune—sad, though it were—to wit-
ness in action. To the school rep-
resented by that team I have no
small word of praise because I ap-
preciate; the fact that such an ag-
gregation is not . the : product of
mere flesh and blood.
In the light of what transpired
in Tigertown on Saturday I believe
we would not be far amiss if we
were, to present you chaps with the
palm as1 the country’s best even tif
the season is not yet half done. Do
continue the fine work; don’t lose
your edge. As loyal a body of sup-
porters as you have anywhere^-4the
West Point team — will be sorely
disappointed if you crack. We are
just as eager as your own student
body to see you crash through un-
beaten. .	-
This is my leave-taking.of Notre
Dame. In the four years that Pve
won an Army jersey it was not my
lot to enjoy a victory over Rock’s
charges, or eyen approach that
lofty height. As I. say good-bye to
you and through you to , all that is
Notre Dame in a football sense, I
want to assure you that notwith-
standing four such barren years I
have nothing but a profound feel-
ing of pride in. having met . on the
field of play, men of such dash and
spirit,- who. played the game only as
you fellows from South Bend know
how to play it. •	.'	' Y
;; My warm personal' regards. and'
the well wishes of-the’Army squad,
to you and to the members of the
Notre'Dame squad. ,	-	, ■
Very sincerely,	,
Denis Mulligan,
Army Captain. 1923. ::

Phelan’s Charges'Make Good Show-
's Ing in Big Ten Games; Plays
Game Similar to Rockmen.
‘ The Home coming crowd, which
will hover close to the 25,000 mark,
will not be disappointed in expect-
. ing Jim Phelan’s proteges from Pur-
' due to put up a hard struggle
against the Rockmen in next Sat-
urday’s clash on Cartier field.
;' With such a steady player as Cap-
tain Claypool at center, Wellman,
last season’s brilliant fullback, • on
the left flank and Carlson, a plung-
, ing demon, in the back field, .the La-
fayette school will come to South
Bend this week, hoping to do what
three great, football machines failed
, , to do; hold the Irish to a low score,
if it is not possible to defeat, them.
./.Against Iowa, the Engineers made
a remarkable showing, and retained
the same fighting qualities for the
vMoroon tilt in Chicago last week.
Considering that Stagg’s charges
are among the leading title contend-
ers this fall, the team from Purdue
did well in having ‘ the better of a
.	670 score at the end of the first
half against Chicago. Purdue
. scored first in the Midway encounter
and then during1 the rest of the
game held down the terrific Maroon
■ drives.	;
- J In Worth, Phelan has a consistent
punter. at right half, whose kicks
average 45 yards , in the Chicago
game. Spradling, at left half, is
shifty and fast and fully capable of
following an interference. In the
game Saturday, the Purdue backs
from the second half till the.* final
■ whistle, did not have much bppor-
tunity to show their- wares, since
' they were forced to punt on nearly
every attempted march down the
. field, after finding they could not
make their first downs. ■	7
Purdue has,an ,attack very similar
. to that used by Notre Dame, with
the exception that they have built
up a spread formation in-which the
half-back and full-back take their
position far to the side of the team
; and just a little, back,of the line of
\ scrimmage, in order that they'can
- not be called for;more than eleven
. men on the line.''/From this-forma-

with South Bend High
. Badin hall scrimmaged south
-Bend high yesterday afternoon on
Brownson field. Badin scored three,
touchdowns against the Benders;
two by regular formations and a
third by a 40-yard run by Calla-
han through a broken field.
The Badin lineup was changed by
the injury of Gapt. Haecker, who
received a broken hand in last Sun-
day’s game. McQuern was brought
from fullback to center. Deve-
raux was placed at full from ah end
position and Kizer will take Deve-
raux’s place at end. Ben Kesting,
who received a wrenched knee Sun-
day, is back in the game at tackle.
