Skill Necessary to Order Meals, at “Cqf”
Before Present Management Took Charge
Important as the campus cafe- '	*	~ ‘'
teria is to the. student body, com-
paratively little is known of its his-
tory or of the daily problems it has
to. meet. Both are interesting.
The cafeteria was taken over and
converted into its present arrange-
ment in October,. 1921. Before that
time the place had been used as„ a
sort of semi-restaurant and was
managed by “the Greeks.” It had
a few chairs and tables with a long!
wooden counter running along the
wall. The patron shouted his. or-
der into the. kitchen and continued
to walk .toward the farther end of
the counter. By regulating his pace
he would reach, the end of the
counter at the same time as would
| the order. This required • skill and
stalle'd a new counter and . new
equipment, which is still , in use.
Speh is the .'brief ' history, of the
cafeteria. '	,	.
And now for a few of the prob-
lems that the present management
must meet. The greatest handicap

for Coming Season
Ten home games, featured with
invasions by six conference schools,
are included on the . 1924. baseball
schedule- announced by Coach
George Keogan yesterday. The pro-
gram lists 27 games, of which eight
encounters are carded on the an-
nual spring training trip which, be-
gins April 10.
Meet Center College
The southern jaunt will coyer
much the same route’ that was fol-
lowed last year and will begin with
a two-game, series against Georgia
Tech at Atlanta. The opening of
athletic relations with Center .col-
lege in a game there April 18 is
notable in this part of the-schedule.
The first home game will bring
Western State Normal to Cartier
field, and there will follow in.suc-
cession four games here, which will
include Michigan on April' 30 and
Indiana on May 0. The varsity is
scheduled for a game with Illinois
at Urbana and then returns home,
to entertain Iowa and Mirinesota.
The appearance of Illinois, Iowa
and Michigan on the Irish schedule
is the signal for some big-time, base-
ball. Iowa and Michigan are the
particular rivals of the locals out-
side of the state, and basebal his-
tory at Notre Dame recounts some
games between thees schools that
are replete with thrills. The long-
existing rivalry -will add zest to the
games on the local diamond;

high honor to Laymen of
AMERICA TO BE GIVEN
FOR 41 ST TIME
.. The Laetare medal, annually con-
ferred by the University of Notre
Dame upon a layman of the Cath-
alic faith in the United States
whose work in the cause of religion
and national endeavor has been out-
standing, will be awarded this year
to Charles Donagh Maginnis, dis-
tinguished architect of Boston.
The medal is a tribute to the lay-
man’s achievement in • serving his
country and faith, through notable
work in his chosen profession. As
a reward, it holds, nationally, the
significance which is attached to
the Papal honor of the Golden
Rose.	. •	i
Long Conspicuous
Mr. Maginnis has long been a
conspicuous figure in Americap
architecture, particularly - along
Catholic ecclesiastical lines, doing
tremendous things for the preser-
vation of the rich architectural tra-
dition of The Church.
' Charles Donagh Maginnis, son of
Charles and Bridget (McDonagh)
Maginnis, was born in Londonderry,
(Ireland, in 1867, educated in Dublin
and in London. At the latter place,
! he won the Queen’s Prize in mathe-
matics. ■
At the age of 17, he came to
Boston, commencing his architec-
tural career as a draftsman in Bos-
ton offices. Mr. Maginnis rapidly
made a brilliant reputation for him-
self as a draftsman, his pen and
ink sketches being fresh and orig-.
inaL in;.style. . Jn ;189.6,_he: became/ J
identified with Timothy Walsh and, •
Mathew Sullivan, in: the firm of
Maginnis,. ' Walsh and Sullivan,
which now survives under the name
of Maginnis and Walsh.
. - -Author and Illustrator
. He has been a member of the
Municipal. Art commission of Bos-
ton, since 1906; a fellow of the
American Institute of Architects; - ■
member of the.Massachusetts State
Art commission since 1911; a mem-
ber of the Boston Society of Arch- .
itects; Boston. Architectural club;
Arts and Crafts society; American
Academy of Arts ’and - Sciences.
He is author of a book, on the sub-
ject . of “Pen Drawing,” and .has
written and illustrated articles for
various magazines,’ both' literary
and architectural.	/ '
I Mr. Maginnis is especially ad- :
mired among his - contemporary \
architects • for the effective and de-
termined fight he has carried on
for the better designing of Catholic
churches.and their accessories. In-
to this labor Mr. . Maginnis has
thrown an intense, joy,and an in-,
telligent erithusiasrn. ■	.
Primarily an artist, he has an ;
easy faculty bf giving architectural
expression to difficult' subtleties of
design, and his work never loses
the essential character of the edi-
fice. . It has been ’said of him that
he possesses “all the idealism which
made the early Italian Renaissance
so charining,' and his . churches in
every instance are ; truly' monu-
ments of .architecture.”. :	’
• Mr. Maginnis has capably.' exe-
cuted notable work Tn, New York
and New England, such as,St. Regis
high school,, St. Catherine’s in Som-
erville, and in Washington, the
Supplication Seminary arid the Na- '
tional Shrine b'ft-the 'Immaculate ,
Conception.	■.../■
’ It' is in - recognition 'of his im- ,
pressive. accomplishment that he
has been selected, as the latest re-
cipient of .the. Laetare: medal. v. , *
The.;list of the1 recipients of the
honor for the past 40 years is as '

What Others Say
The New Amendment
Another time delaying feature of
the country bids well to be dis-
carded to the legislative waste bas-
ket—with the passage of the bill
providing the amendment to the
constitution for the president’s in-
auguration on January’s third Mon-
day, by a vote of some 63 to 7, in
the senate. Now the house will de-
bate. And if it passes the states
will । have something to discuss.
There is not a great deal to be said
for the bill other than that it gets
the new president started earlier in
the year—and earlier in their ad-
ministration. But this is, as the

.■Z\dZZ- ONCE AGAIN, ACTIVITIES
“I Should say that 90 per cent of all our failures are included among
those men who aim only to. skim by and spend their time instead on
activities.that.-the university tolerates. By such ‘tolerated’ activities I
mean the college j publications, the dramatic organizations, and the var-
iousI managerial competitions. . . . These men that come before us are
not’quite able to judge that amount necessary ‘just to pass,’ and hence
are speedily discharged.”	/
- x Dean. William F. Magie, chairma nof the committee oh examina-
tions and standings, of Princeton, speaking. .
,.Dean’Magie should know whereof,he speaks, for he is in a posi-
tion to know. ‘-But, not having seen, figures, we arez inclined to wonder
if the case is the same at every university. .By observation and per-
sonal knowledge, a Notre Dame; man might presume otherwise. To
call to mind certain examples on the Notre Dame campus of men prom-
inent; in activities, is to call to mind men who, so far as one can tell
with'limited-information, are also high in scholastic standing. Now
' that'we have heard Dean Magie speak, we wonder if this cursory opin-J
ion of the situation at Notre Dame is wrong. Such figures, or such an
opinion, coming from the office of. the directors of studies here, would
be interesting.
; ’ Coach" Knute Rockne’s tribute to Notre Dame upon signing his new
contract, finds , an echo pnr the (hearts of all Notre Dame men. It would
fie ’a fine tiling if all-alumni, were as loyal, as sacrificing, as staunch in
their support; as is Rockne. .	:

TO OPEN SEASON
BASEBALL and track men
PRACTICE FOR INITIAL ,
GAMES OF SEASON
The coming week in Notre Dame
sporting circles will be marked -with
the business of preparation of the;
opening events of the outdoor track
season and the baseball program;
Rockne and a large squad of track-
men will take a week-end jaunt to’
Greencastle to engage De Pauw in;
the first outdoor dual track meet
bf the 1924 season. Coach Keo-
gan and a squad of baseball men
will take the field against North-
western at Evanston, next Monday,
April 7.
The strength of the De Pauw ag-
gregation is unknown outside of
Paul Jones, who won the all-around
title in the Illinois relay carnival.
The De Pauw hopes are placed with
no little emphasis on the ability of
Jones to come through in the pole
vault, high jump and broad jump.
The diminutive downstate track ath-
lete jumped over 6 feet at the Illi-
nois games and was broad jumping
in the vicinity of 22 feet. The re-,
mainder of the program should be
featured- by Notre Dame victories.
The Irish squad, under the leader-
- hip'of Captain Kennedy, have been
making steady progress toward per-
fection all winter and although the
meet next Saturday will force the
locals to compete without having
had much outdoor work, the oppo-
sition offered, by. the downstaters
should not be so great that the pro-
teges of Rockne , will be driven to,
desperation to win.
The baseball squad confined their
practice session to the gym yester-
day afternoon, due to the unfavor-
able condition of the weather. The
men worked through the routine
drill that has been laid out for
them by coach and if the campus
is clothed- with some, regulax base-
ball weather today, there is some
possibility that a game will feature

Iowa Campus Mourns
Rock’s New Contract
IOWA CITY, la., Mar. 29.—The
announcement that Coach Knute
K. Rockne had signed a ten-year
contract to remain as director of
athletics at the University of Notre
Dame caused a sudden interruption
of the football victories that the
Iowa City fans had been counting
for the past few weeks. .The news
of the contract that was Notre
Dame’s joy, was Iowa’s gloom.
Gloom and more gloom overspread
the campus as soon as the report
had gained a wide circulation.
The president of Iowa univer-
sity and several officials of the
school replied that they had noth-
ing to say when asked to discuss
the situation. Just how soon def-
inite steps will be taken to settle the
coaching problem at the Iowa
school will probably be . decided
upon at the special board meeting
scheduled for tonight.
the afternoon workout, members of
the squad making up the opposing
teams.
Coach Maury Kent of North-
western has entertained no little
worry over the encounter with the
Irish as he wished1 his players to be
in the best of form when the Blue
and Gold contingent invades Chi-
cago’s north shore.. The Purple
mentor faces a problem that has
beset the mentors of more than one
conference school this season—
pitchers. Other than the lack of
choice material for slab duty, the
Purple team will be well fortified
with veteran material in the other
positions.
The Cleveland and Kansas games
will be the next assignment for
Rockne’s relay men.

NEW YORK, Mar., 29.—That
the American Olympic track team
will be coached by the ablest
crew of track, mentors in the
country is the opinion of one of
New York’s most capable sport
critics. The - coteries of coaches
that will embark with the American
team in June to direct the work
of the. cinder path . artists in the
Olympic games represents a gath-
ering of men of established reputa-
tion and untold abilities.'
Heading the list are two ’men
whose work with the team, more
than that of any of the other se-
lected coaches will- have, a direct
bearing on the success of the Amer-
ican athletes^ ' Lawson Robertson
of’the University of Pennsylvania,
who .may be considered a veteran
Olympic coach, having made the
trip to Antwerp four years ago, was
The first man chosen and his name
was immediately followed by that
of Walter Christie. of the Univer-
sity of California. Both men are
widely known in this country for
their prowess as track coaches.
Both men have enjoyed enviable
success in developing phenomenal
track teams. The universities of
Pennsylvania and California, have
held a prominent place in American
track history for several years past.

Shot Fifty Feet On the Level
PRINCETON, N. J., -Mar. 29.—
while the Princeton Tiger track
team was working out on the cinders
last Wednesday, Ralph Hills scored
an unofficial record in the shot put
when he registered a heave of 50
feet, 3 inches. Hill has been one
of the most consistent weight throw-
ers that has appeared in collegiate
ranks during’ the past two years.
Coach Keane Fitzpatrick seems
to have a squad of field performers
for his track team that is composed
of phenomenal weight throwers.
After Hill put the 16-pound shot
for the unofficial record, several
other men of the team registered
49. feet, and one man was: credited
with a toss of 49 feet, 8 inches.
two mentors came the name of
Amos Alonzo Stagg, slated to han-
dle the middle distance men on the
Olympic track. His success in de-
veloping star quarter and half
milers at Chicago led to his being
named on the ' American . team.
Harry Hillman of Dartmouth and
Tom Keane of Syracuse have- also
been named on the Olympic coach-
ing staff in recognition for their
meritorious work at their respective
schools. Tom Keane hopes to have
one of -his pet idols on the Paris
track when the speed men line up
in July. Chet Bowman, sensational
Syracuse halfback is preparing to
score a qualifying place in the
Olympic trials in order to secure
his berth to the international
games.

Bruff Cleary, local /referee, is to
be commended for the; admirable
fashion in which he officiated at the
Interhall games during the basket-
ball, season just closed. The ’’sec-
ond lieutenant” of the Notre Dame
gym has rendered a. notable service
to the. interhall sport season by en-
forcing strictly .the rules of the
game and taking particular - care'
that every encounter, was-played off
according to Hoyle. Cleary served
the Interhall, league . in a similar
manner in football,' and.it is,large-

cess of the interhall sport;.season
was. actualized.
John - McGraw, Christy ‘Mathew-
son, Ty Cobb and other baseball
leaders have issued the edict , that .
no player can play golf during the
baseball season. Some . managers
contend- that it - hurts - the’ player’s
hitting ability, others say it takes
his real vocation, baseball,- off- his
mind and concentrates it on golf.
John McGraw gives, this as his rea-
son: “I don’t want my players to
play golf for golfers sb seldom get
home, and I would-dislike this con-
dition to prevail among - my .play-
ers.”

Brother Terence Has Been Locksmith
at Notre Dame for More Than 20 Years
Foi’ more than.twenty years there
has been established in the rear of
the infirmary building a little shop,
about 6x10 feet, in which Brother
Terence has been engaged in mak-
ing keys for this community. Broth-
er Terence began work at Notre
Dame by assisting in the infirmary
and maintaining :the shop at the
same time. . Seven years later, he
abandoned the infirmary and since
■ then has devoted his time exclusive-
ly to key manufacturing.
He performs practically all the
work of. making keys and repairing
locks for the campus and neighbor-
hood. . Very few of . the students
here know of this brother and his
work; those who do usually apply
to him to open doors, trunks and
lockers.
Brother Terence has been in
Notre Dame for more than twenty
years, and was 72 years old on the
6th of this month. He manufac-
tures approximately 2,200 keys an-
nually, averaging about six a day;
besides repairing locks whenever
the occasion may arise. All the
work is accomplished in this little
shop, which has but a single work
bench and only a few tools.
