ABSURDITIES GIVE
' NEW VIEW OF N.D.
DEMONSTRATE GRID STARS’
VERSATILITY AND SHOWS
NEW ENTERTAINMENT.
With the presentation' last night
of the “Monogram Absurdities of
1924, An Institution Mortifying
the Notre Dame Man,” Commence-
ment guests of the University saw
a departure from the usual type of
Notre Dame entertainment. From
the opening pattei’ chorus to: the
closing, number it was typical of
Notre Dame; from the fii;st artistic
kick of. Jimmie_ Crowley to .the last
crack ' by "'Red. Maher,'- it ’ ‘ demon-
strated the , Notre Dam.e man’s ver-
satility which , permits of stardom
on the stage boards, as well as ex-
cellence on the gridiron., .■
The absurd was admirably
blended with the serious, and one
laugh came right after another.
There was a moment of two, of
course; when the audience sat hor-
ror-stricken at the fiendish revenge
of one Algernon O’Rourke, known
at all other times as.Jimmie Crow-
ley, and wrung their hands at the
sad plight of little Sophie, who
-sometimes. answers to, the name,of
Frank Milbauer, but the prompt ar-
rival of Harry. Stuhldreher on the
scene relieved the strain. , .
And then there was the minstrel
episode in which Red'Maher,.Frank
McGrath, • Harold , Cooke ' and
Jimmie Crowley combined all/the
qualifies of Eddie Cantor with those
•of - Signor Frisco. • Charley Butter-
worth distinguished,himself as Rod-
ney Stacom, the. goof able . (and
goofed) “If Papa Nu” manj while
Hunsinger, Magevney, et. - al. en-
joyed themselves as the goofers..
With “Rock” as the interlocutor,
and with/ Father. Hugh O’Donnell,
Vince Fagan, Harvey Brown, .and
Frank Kolars back , stage directing
things, the “Absurdities” only dem-
bnstrated once more what. “Rock
and His Men” can accomplish; As
Rex Enright would say,z “It shows
what conscientious i effort and’ a
little hard work will do.’’. .,

noon at 1:30, in the Alumnui office

strated that \ the class .secretary
really provides the connecting link
between his classmates, and be-
tween them and the University.'

inaugurated during the past year,
and every class , since 1884 has its
secretary and .has., been actively co-
operating / with . him to keep, in

NOLAN FLAYS FORCES THAT BRIDLE
AND IMPERIL AMERICAN LIBERTIES
Mark E. Nolan, LL. B., orator of
the class of ’24, delivered the Com-
mencement Oration, “America.n
Fundamentals,” i n Washington
Hall, yesterday morning. The ora-
tion follows:
The existence of this great Uni-
versity, which is our Alma Mater,
,* depends upon a charter from the
’ government ,of the State; that gov-
1 ernment in turn rests upon the
Constitution of the State of In-
diana, and the foundation of all is
the Constitution of the United
States. We must realize that Ameri-
can education, industrialism, pros-
perity and greatness were made pos-
’ sible. by the existence of certain
fundamentals in the American sys-
tern of government. Our constitu-
tional system rests upon the belief
. that every man is born with certain
natural rights which may be sum-
med up as those of life, liberty
and property. These rights are
not
'given to man by the state, though
the-State may protect therii; they
• are not consessionsof society to the
, individual but they are rights which
even the State itself cannot proper-
ly deny. These rights are enumerat-
ed and protected by the Federal
Constitution and by the' constitu-
tioris of the several states, > which

' In less than a century arid a half
this nation has grown from man in-
secure confederacy ' composed, of
thirteen states huddled together on
a btrip of the Atlantic shore to
the World’s greatest' power of for-
ty-eight constitutent ■ common-
wealths. In. the, center.'.of a con-
- tinent thiat a few centuries ago was
virgin forest, untouched mountains,
pathless plains, wild prairies and si-
lent, 'streams, which . had? never
' -known the? sight/of civilized mail,
thrives a nation of teeming indus-
trialism,' prosperous ■ people, \ con-
tented cities and happy ^firesides:
- During .this' period of development
?thenation has -often been disrupted
. by bitter internal dissension, arid af-
flicted by destructive foes1 from
. without. Unpatriotic forces of in-
. tolerance,. discord and revolution
have more than price, threatened
z the foundations upon which our in-
■ stiutions rest.' But America after
. ..weathering- the violent storms of
the years; .; sails the; seas of
- ,political	'destiny/ ' unconquered
. by thex waves	of • dissolution',
. and looms as	colossal figure
on the interriational horizon;, an-en-
' during monument to the wisdom,
the patierice/the unstinted sacrifice
hnd fiurnirig zeal of the; Nation?s
. Fathers. As we meditate upon the
grandeur of this new world demo-
. cracy, we must feel thankful that a
. gracious providence , guided ' the
, hands of the Nation’s builders /as
• they fashioned out of the unweildy
. colonies/ the-.sturdy. foundations ’of
the world’s greatest Republic.-
When we read the story of this
nation, we‘ find that our people
at different periods have been
the victims of; a hysteria which
has been : as various in its
forms as destructive in its nature.
While our government was yet an
infant, this hysteria took the form
of distrust in the Federal govern-
ment. The fires of suspicion which
were kept burning by even such no-
ble men as Thomas Jefferson and
LutherxMartin, came near destroy-
ing a nation when»that nation was
scarcely born. Most often this po-
pular hysteria has taken the form
of intolerance and bigotry. Recall
the terrible . days of Knownothing-
ism when intolerance manifested by
legislative enactment, corruption in
the courts, riot and massacre, rock-
ed the very foundations of the
American Republic. In several
states, legislators attempted to abro-
gate constitutional liberties; even
the lives of the little children were
made miserable by the hoots of the
mob and the actions of the school-
masters. Thus throughout our his-
tory one may find indications of
this same hysteria, always destruc-
tive, ever a menace to >the funda-
mental principles of the American
nation.. '	.
At the present time this cduntry
is witnessing anothei* period of hys-
teria, when well-meaning but dan-
gerous reformers, when intolerant
and unAmerican organization, when
radical; and dissatisfied political
groups are working with all inten-
sity to realize their aims. One group
strives for the. curtailment of indi-
vidual liberty and freedom of con-
science-by shackling the American
people with' laws so numerous, so
irritably burdensome that'lack of
respect for all law is the result. A
second group actuated by principals
of intolerance and religious hate is
destroying the spirit of cooperation
and brotherly love in every com-
munity. Lastly men whose _ desires
have^beeh”def eritecT by^the'^courfs,
would destroy the foundations of the
American judicial system and leave
our constitutions the playthings of
popular, whim and . passion. .	,
Organizations'of reform are im-
posing upon our .citizens hteir con-
ceptions. of' private morality and
virtue by legislature decree. Groups
would give their fellow citizens no
chance to be unvirtuous by leaving
their conscience no choice in the
matter. Daily, individual liberities
are being destroyed as minorities in
the name of morality, are. forcing
their mandates upon the people.
There is a tendency manifested by
laws, more daws and. the multiplica-
tion of laws, to resort to legislation
as, a panacea for the wrongs and
evils o^f life from the most serious
to the trivial.; And the result of
this, reform, legislation, this denial
of personal, liberty and freedom of
conscience'is lawlessness. We? can-
not meet .this 'menace by eloquent
and numerous demands for law;and
order. . In . a democracy obedience
to law. depends . upon respect for
law,'and if a law is not the expres-
sion /of the popular will, if.it is the
tyrannical mandate ,of ‘a , misled
minority, if it is a curtailment of in-
dividual liberty and right, that law
cannot possibly have the respect of
the people. The natural and in-
evitable consequence must .be law-
lessness. We must.strive then,not
to , enforce 'law, by making more
laws, by. increasing , the. forces of-
law execution. Rather , must we go
deeper and have all laws be the ex-
pfessidh of /popular sentiment, for
th’e people "will obey'a law which
they have willingly’ passed. r It is
not the. American citizen’s respect
for..lawjand government', that has
failed but it is the. laws which have
failed. -. /	; •. .	. ... .■...•/ '	..■
- But'this fanaticism of reform is
only one of the manifestations of
this political' hysteria. Intolerance
who’s banners are carried by. the
“Invisible Empire” has/ buried its
roots deep into pur- social structure;
hate and-' prejudice today tear, /at
the hearts of our citizen^. Men
actuated by mercenary and political
considerations’though loudly shout-
ing their • patriotism . are . sowing
seeds of discord and violence, at-
tempting to make, prejudice synon-
ymous with'" Americanism arid loy-
of. public. excitement, when . Con-
gress with over-zealous desire for
some law, forgot its limitations and
passed legislation contrary to the
Constitution, it was , the Supreme
Court ..which- preserved our liberties
and safeguarded our, institutions.

Americanism then a spirit of love
and helpfulness in community life
is all wrong; then liberty of speech,

be stricken frorii our constitutional

•Another danger to the. American
constitutional system is. the attack
by the .'forces of radicalism upon
the courts. For the purposes of
guarding bur , Constitution, the third
article of that instrument estab-
lished the Supreme. Court arid cloth-
ed it with jurisdiction; over alLcases
arising under- the ; Constitution?

was repugant to ‘our Constitution it

gress that has been tyrannical
on occasions and riot the Supreme
Court, it has been popular will
which has been repugnant to, the
Constution of the United - States
and riot that' group: of judges ap-
pointed to protect our. supreme law.
.. Yet there are men- today who
would nullify the powers of the Su-
preme Court; men who would make
congress the judge of the; constitu-
tionality of its own ace; men who
would tranfer sovereignty from
the people to our legislative halls
and destroy pur Constitutional sys-
tem to gain the realization of their
own desires. . ; : . / /
. But what has all this: tb do with
college men, Notre Dame and (the
Class of Nineteen Twenty-Four.
We have been reared in the Chris-
tian faith4 and educated in the fun-
damentals of our .. goverririierit.
When we. consider the rights as
listed in our constiuttions / w e
find that these are the sam.- efunda-
mental ' rights of life liberty and
property which Catholic doctririe
teaches us are inalienable, and God-
given. Actuated. by consideration
for-principles of Americanism and
by a spirit of Christianity it is our
duty to so conduct • our lives, to'
so use whatever,, influence bye /may
have in our respective communities
that , these attacks upon the prin-
ciples of oiir government will fail..'-
. We know that reform in; the mat-
ter of private conscience . and con-
duct inust come frorii withiri and
can be brought about only by. the
ministers of God, the-teachers, the
parerit, the, influence of : church/
school and home. ; We cannot de- '
feat night-riding organizations of
intolerance arid ^terror, by adopting
the same tactics. Rather must our .
battle against these organization be
carried bn in the spirit, of justice, -
fair play and tolerance. We .must •
strive to make American ideals and.
principles living things and this can -
be : done only by carrying' these
ideals and principles into our re-
lations with; our neighbors and not
by' high sounding verbiage on lib-
erty patriotism and justice. :	•
; One of the foundation stones of
the American system' is. the theory ..
that powers of government are,less * '
abused when / separted, that’ the
judicial, executive and legislative ■
departments may act as checks
upon each other. ,We must guard :
the courts which are the bulwarks 1
of constitutional liberites,. and guar- .
antees. We, must preserve the in-
tegrity of the American judicial
system, for history has taught men
that no tyranny is more seyere,
more intolerant, and unjustly bitter
than < the tyranny of ' a legislative
assembly or a popular majority.

ture lies in respect for fundamen- ■ '

To The Men of ’24 .
' Men of ’24, you have made Alma Mater, proud of you.. A gem,
iequalling the others in its .brilliant luster, has been added to Notre
Dame’s, radiant crown. You have placed it-there in parting. May. its
glistening rays be the guiding light of your lives. ‘	.
' The parting with school and friends is hard. During four years
friendship has crept delicately and gently to its height. The most
powerful and lasting friendships, have been made in this early season
of your lives. Let them be infinite and immortal, for- friendship, after
all, is the serum that keeps hearts pounding and ideals polished; it is
the shadow of the evening which strengthens with the setting sun of
college days.	"	•	•
May you, of the ’24 class, grasp the chances before you, and make
the desires of your fondest dreams, realities. To be the-learned and
leading men of this generation is, at once, your privilege and your
inheritance. Alma Mater’s final and only recompense is the satisfaction
of self-sacrificing service to . direct the lives of her sons into the most
happy and fruitful paths. . -	.	’	.	•
Men of ’24, you have the finest wishes of those you are leaving
behind, and the blessing of Notre Dame on your conquest of the future.
Commencement Under the Dome
. / The Golden Dome looks down upon a changed and interesting
campus during Commencement. The .boisterous under-classmen have
gone; the “old;boys,” searching eagerly for.familiar faces,—and too
-	often in vain,—stand in little, quiet groups, or seek out tKeir.boyhobd;s
.	familiar haunts by “gym,” or lake or grotto.; parents-of-graduates,—
7 “God bless them all,—with sometimes another son or a daughter, stroll
.	■- about th^bujldings„and^	lawns/ with admiring glances,
:	for'each' single beauty of the campus, and with friendly ones even for
. . . the. varied. faces? of: the “profs”; the-faculty, what is'present of it, is
• safely ensconced, as the country-journalist says, within the balustrades
of the Main Building porch; and the graduates, why, the gradues are

and gown.' He-'delivers orations, learned'orations, calmly and with
confidence; he/reads the class-poem, which interprets.at once the heart
of his fellows and the spirit of his Alma Mater; hq moves in ranks,
. . with dignity, and formally for the last time, into the chapel. There he
prays, foY^the last time with all his fellows, .the men of, Well, “say ’24;

then he follows it to the flagpole and sees it hoisted to the summit, the
. - flag of the class of ’24, the flag of the United States of America; and
• then in the dusk one fellow speaks .the class’/valedictory; and then,
at the call of his name, lie~whlks out" before the great assembly and
up on a conspicuous platform, where sit his "four-years' teachers, and
-receives his diploma' Somehow, he-does not feel so learned now, nor
•. even so big and strong. The" “old boys” are watching, him, and so
are the fellows and the “profs,” but most, of all he(feels the eyes that
never leave. him, the eyes, of one: little* woman’s graying, comely head,
. the; prettiest head in all that crowd. Then the thing is over. Within
• a day, the campus-is deserted, hotels, and stations resume their normal
course. Is it all worth wMle? Emphatically, yes, thinks the University,

The. Notre ,Dame Alumnus,, the
• official Alumni -magazine, has just
completed its' most successful year,
under the editorship .of Alfred' C.

magazine, which .combines news of

mJ.
~ coming popular with graduates.
The success of “Universal Notre

-Alumni, and made- successful
. through the efforts of the Alumnus
and Ryan is evidence of this popu-
larity. The increase in number of
old students returning to this 80th
Commencement is also due to the
influence of the Alumnus in the
various cities and clubs. In every
way, this magazine is a credit to
the Alumni association, and to

Last Concert^ Friday
The University Glee. _*cl
> 1923-1924, sang its last concert
. Friday evening, in Washington
hall, under the direction, of Dr, J.
Lewis Browne, well-known Chicago
composer and conductor of the
club. .	./ .
-Miss Sarah McCabe, the possps-
■ sor of a colorful soprano voicej was
the assisting soloist of the evening.
The University orchestra, also
under the tutelage of Dr. Browne
this year, presented several num-
bers as its part of the program. A
-particularly appreciative Com-
mencement audience crowded the
> . hall.; (	. ' .
The program presented by the
Glee club was substantially the
same as that presented so success-
fully throughout the year. , The
Jmost enjoyable number was “Drink
: To Me' Only With Thine Eyes,” with
, solos of Vernon Rickard, tenor, and
, George Koch, baritone, contrasted
with the musical background fur-
nished by the. remainder /of the
club. Both singers possess voices
of unusual merit and brilliancy.
Other groups on the program in-
cludedseveral /ancient classical
numbers . written by Palestrina..
“Junetime,” by Dr. .Browne, was
.well received. Tire,rendition of the
numbers, showed on the whole ar-
tistry and talent that is extraordi-
nary among college glee clubs.
: K Miss McCabe ^charmed her audi-
ence with her personality and her
■ tonal technique. She has become
popular with Notre Dame audiences
this year through the efforts of Dr.
Bpwne,. under whom she is study-
I ing. The 'dulcet tones, of her lyric

In bringing the compliriients of
many prominent alumni now lo-
cated in and' near Washington, D.
C., and voicing his thanks for the
honorary degree which will be con-
ferred upon ' him today, Major
Frederick William Wile, brought his
speech to the topic anriounced,
“The Government at Washington
Still Lives.”	:
“There . were citizens who de-
plored the house cleaning that took
place in Washington,” he said in
the course of his talk, “but now I
think we may. congratulate our-
selves that they'have.brought the
corruption to view. ’ For Out of the
muck at Washington there stands
one thing—that- corruption in our
government is the', exception rather
•than the| rule.
“May Notre Dame continue to
turn out high-minded young men
capable of meeting the problems
which rise up in this country. If
so, the government at Washington
will continue to live, one and in-
divisible.”

CLASS SORRY TO LEAVE NOTRE DAME
AS CATEWAY TO NEW LIFE OPENS
Donald >S. Gallagher, Litt. B./
president and valedictorian of the
class of ’24, delivered the valedic-
tory at the Class Day exercises,
held in Washington Hall yesterday
morning. The valedictory follows:
We, the members of the Class of
; 1924, assemble to bid a united fare-
well to our Alma. Mater.: For four
।years we have looked ahead with
glad expectancy to the time of our
graduation. This day has seemed to
us as an open gate , through which
we were to pass from a period of
work and study to an active life
in the world. In our. freshman
year this gate seemed far distant,
but in time we found ourselves ap-
proaching it all too speedily. This
morning, we are gathered at the
gateway but it is with a sentiment
t of reluctance that we consider the
/
life .before us.
, , It seems only a few short months
since we bade good-bye to relatives
and friendp on setting fojrtjh to
College. At first our hearts were
filled with- misgivings: we found
ourselves in a new * and strange
world amid strangers. But a qiuck
acquaintance with the spirit of No-
tre Dame followed and we were at
home., We prepared to incorporate
in our lives the lessons and exam-
■ pies of true manhood which Notre
' Dame gives to her . children. We
. made new friends and found .pleas-*
. ant associations in campus life;, we
were happy and Notre Dame, Our
Mother,. saw . that we were , content
.-and she .was pleased. A new Class
had been entrusted to her and: she
.. assumed the burden with gladness.
- Having as'we have a' deep love
for this school/and a tender regard
for-everything connected with her
name, we have' no words capable of
; expressing our devotion to ' Notre
Dame. It is with a deep sense of
gratiutde that we go out from our
- Class rooms to face the problems of
the world, to fight the. battle of
life in the company of those who
have gone before us., "•:
Notre Dame, at her foundation,
. was inspired by our Blessed Mother,
with a great purpose. She hasrbeen
• - true to that purpose and at all times
"■ we/have received/from her the in-
.. spiration that we sought. During
- - four years we have sat at her feet,
i-listening to her words and accepting
: ■ the lessons that only the .spirit of a*
;. Mother can inspire. As a true
Mother she has cared for us. fondly.
, .' .and her hand has always been ready
>:to point out, the proper path and to
n strengthen us, with sound religion,
•.that we might carry on with true
. /Christian courage. How unsatis-
', factory - iti-.^would 'be td" attempt ■ ;to
■ express, by words the. gratitude.-.jwe
(owe. The parting of friends ' is
-/hard, but harder* still is the separa-
i tion from Alma -Mater. Notre Dame
. /has given us her all and. has spared
: ;;no. sacrifice that our success in life
• may be assured.;. Her last request
. : is that we be honest- and upright.
- Her final reward’ will be in the
1 knowledge that-we, her;'children,
■ have lived up to the lessons she has
: taught us. With these thoughts’ in
■ ; mind, we hope to -do , service.. - to
...t country, honor our University and
. ; to go the longer road with God. /
; ,W6 are .parting now and the sor-
.: i row. .that weighs upon our hearts is
, /alleviated onlyby the .hope? that in
, ■ our future endeavors we may fe-
■; / .fleet credit on Alma Mater. Notre
; Dame wished our success. She p^ys
. ; -that, her sons .may be- rewarded in
v life .and . that our example, Notre
/Dame men,' may gain?the admira-
: tion of all. Our education here has
:-not< been a merely mechanical af-
y .-. fair.' /Chis fact is clear-.to us in the
.; , /the- sadness of our farewell, in the
. ^sorrow that- overwhelms our hearts.
That we love this school is evident
and our affection is ‘ emphasized by
the sorrow we feel today. We are
not ashamed of this sorrow; we are
proud of it, and the mother who
has guided us is proud, for she is
sending us out animated with the
spirit of brotherly love.
At this moment of < parting, we
are by no means unmindful of
those who have made bur success
possible. First, we lift our hearts
in thanksgiving to God, whose pro-
vidence has given us this priceless
gift. Our dear parents, who have
watched over us from infancy and
shielded us from, harm with sym-
pathetic- care, make ’ by their pres-
ence here today another manifes-
tion of their. love and their ambi-
tion for our success. We turn in
gratitude to the kind Priests,' Broth-
ers, and Professors, whose lives of
sacrifice to , duty have exhausted
every, energy to help us from the
aimlessness of youth to. the goal of
higher education.
Men of the Class of ’24, our last
days at Notre Dame . have been
marked for us by a sentiment of
sorrow which can be understood
only by those who know the affec-
tion that binds us.to Notre Dame.
Fellows, we must say good-bye.
Some of us will meet again to re-
view fondly the . memories of our
college days,, but never again shall
we be reunited as a complete class.
Henceforth the friendly smile, the
familiar 'voices ‘ and the ; hearty
hand-clasp of dear- friends can be
but memories., 'It is sad, this our
last greeting to each' other. But we
shall’ treasure unto the end the
sacred memories of our years to-
gether at Notre Dame. ; We shall al-
rways remember the laughter'of No-
tre Dame, and, after today, the
tears. :
• Dear old School, we are not
ashamed( of our sadness for we
know that you understand, Mother
of Ours. It is the end of our Col-
lege' life' and the beginning of <a
future in the world; Noire Dame,
farewell. ;	: \

BEEN LEADING HITTER
FOR TWO YEARS.
, The Notre Dame outdoor track
team, . led by Captain Paul Ken-
nedy, yesterday afternoon ended a
very successful season. This year
again, Notre ‘ Dame tracksters
copped the state track title, having
done it for the tenth consecutive
time. ' .	' ,
DePauw and the Michigan Ag-
gies were .also defeated in dual
meets. The only loss of the season
was to Harry Gill’s crack Illinois
squad, which won the Big Ten
championship.
The opening meet was with De
Pauw,‘ and resulted in an easy vic-
tory featured by the performance
of Oberst, who threw the javelin
195 feet, 7 inches. Oberst was also
the star ’of the Illinois meet, de-
feating Angier, the national inter-
collegiate champion. ■’ . He was ■ the
a
first in this meet; Butler, seriously
threatened Notre Dame’s suprem-
acy in the state meet, but the un-
expected victory of Harrington in
the pole vault over Jones of De
Pauw gave it to Notre Dame, by a
score, of 53 3-4 to 45. Harrington
and Oberst established new state
records. The meet with the Aggies
was taken by a score of .91 1-2 to
341 1-2. -	’

fashion for the past two years and
is rated as one/of Notre. Dame’s
leading hitters. Nolan succeeds

Hickey and Scallan Are Named
to Run Juggler and Daily in ’25
At the final business meeting of the school, year Tuesday, the new,
S. A. C. elected Jack Scallan editor-in-chief of the next year?s Daily, and
Corbin Patrick as business manager. • These appointments did not come
entirely as a surprise to the men
on the campus, because the ’24
■ | Dome proved Jack’s ability as an
editor while the well filled adver-
tising pages of the Daily, espe-
cially during the past few months,
proved that Corbin , could be
counted upon to make the Daily a
success again next year.
Appointment of assistants for
next year’s Daily have not been
made yet but the men who con-
tributed so much to the success
of the paper this year will again
find, places on the staff.
The men who retire this year
are the editor-in-chief, Paul Funk,
the past’ editor, Harry McGuire,
Jack Scallan	and business, manager, John Stan-
ton, and the past business managers, James Hayes and Walter Haecker.
. The appointment by.the S. A. C. of. Dan.D. Hickey as editor-in-chief
of the Juggler for 1924-’25, and Frank McCarthy, as business manager
came very deservedly. Hickey and McCarthy have put the Juggler in
the front rank of college humor-
ous magazines. Recognition of
the quality of art and editorial
matter in the Juggler has come
from colleges all over' the coun-
try and the high standard of art
in the. magazines ,is shown when
ov*r two dozen drawings have
been reproduced in Judge, the na-■ •
tional humorous weekly. The
covers of the Juggler this year
Aave been a feature. Three colors
have' been used in each of the
eight issues.	.	. ■
The staff of next year’s Jug-
gler will -be selected 'during the'
summer and '.contributors who
have shown ability will be se-
lected. . . ’
