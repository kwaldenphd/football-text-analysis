chapels and houses twenty-two chapels altogether. It is a good example
’of Gothic throughout; and from the choir loft, looking down the avenue

The -windows are one of the chief glories of the church, and their
identification on a sunny day makes a delightful study. Working in
stained glass is one of the few remaining mediums of artistic expression
which calls for the cooperation of a group of artists with a need for the
artistic feeling of each. Painting glass is still a handicraft, although
imitations are made by modern mechanical and time-saving processes..
Of course, the imitations need not concern us, for the windows in our
Church are genuine.
The architectonic mind -that conceived the ideas, made the first
small designs to be enlarged to scale, and supervised the making of the'
windows in the' Church of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, was Mother

“A man must serve his time to every trade
_	Save censure—criticsjall are ready made.”. :
; .	—Byrom '	'
; Criticism easily classifies itself into two varieties.. Constructive
criticism, the only legitimate kind, tears down the old order, but does
not neglect to suggest a . newer, bdtter. order. Destructive criticism
merely seeks to. destroy.	’	: '	. ?	.
When the millenium comes, and?we have achieved perfection, there
will be no need for critics; but weiwill no doubt have them just the
same. There are those who would assume the roles of fault-finders and
iconoclasts even if perfection.-were before their eyes. -
. ’ Gautier once remarked that no jman becomes a critic until he has
’ satisfied himself that'he cannot be a poet. This sentence, which has
more than a grain of. truth, gives the. key to the whole situation; For.
the man who does this has no opportunity for self-defense. The critic
has nothing of his own that can be criticised. .	.
Satisfaction, sometimes,begets boredom and stagnation, we admit.
Furthermore, there are undoubtedly ‘ things wrong in this great uni-
verse of ours. But it is easily seen that, weak and defective as it is,:
the machine still runs, and with a few repairs now and then, runs
and1 so closely have the nuns held to the ideal of medieval art that their
craftsmanship has lent distinction ito our windows .and transmitted
beauty to the beholder.. Though the. chastened face of a saint or the
jdelicate beauty of a virgin has been presented on glass with sympathy,
'this consideration is secondary to the general effect. ’ The windows
should be judged first as mosaics of glowing colors, their surroundings
harmonizing architecturally with their setting. Viewed from ..within,
the warmth of the sun. brightening; them, or. from without, when the
church is illuminated at night, the windows, are, things of beauty.

snowj and howling winds, it would, terminate in a very spring-like
manner, or visa versa, is upheld by many superstitious individuals. .
> Now whether or not their hypothesis is founded,upon any substan-
tial facts makes little or no difference. Neither are we concerned, with !
the scientists who are advancing thd theory that a slight but constant
variation in the earth’s movement is pausing a change in seasons. Some
of 7them say that the clearing of our forests and the draining of our
sw'amps and marshes has had a decided influence upon the changing
climate. Others say that the transferring of millions of tons of ore
and .‘minerals from their natural deposits to the .big industrial centers
where it is melted, into steel and other metals to be, used in construc-
■ tion .-work in .the big\cities, is. tending to over-balance the earth, effect-
ing the orbital attraction, and consequently, is responsible for the. unus-
ually, different'temperatures that occur within each season. , But here
is the thing we Notre Dame men are interested in: If a robin was
■ seen yesterday afternoon perched on a, twig of a tree in front of the
library, how long is it before spring? .	‘	;

however, seems to be scandal. Its
columns, which are written in good
style, contain everything that any-
Jone has done to advance his social

IVhdf Others Say
Harvard and Football'
harvard is considering, ' accord-
ing to the secretary of that univer-
sity,’the reduction of athletic sched-
ules to the extent that the Crimson
may engage in but one football
game a year, the Yale game. There
is little'doubt but that .this would
cost Harvard teams and football,
players all consideration when it
came to picking champions and all-
Americans. _ The showing made in
one game wo.uld have little weight,
no matter how important that game?
and no team can make a decent
showing, in a single game, without
practice encounters. 77 .7 7 7 7. 4
' But that is beside the point.. The
t Harvard faculty members7 who fa7
vor the cut in schedules are appar-
ently satisfied thatthis should hap-.-
pen. Where'they are making their
. fatal mistake, is in overlooking the
fact that in stifling varsity athletics,
they are doing away with the most
potent factor in encouraging all
students to take part in intramural
contests, ‘which the most academic
minds agree are important factors-
in turning out,well.balanced college
graduates. , - :	; . -: < ■
: ;-,For it is the stimulus of varsity
athletics which more than any oth-
'er^single; factor attracts men to the
intramural sports. 'It is the major
leagues which; are the: mainspring
of all the . sandlot games - in the
country. Collegiate football has in
a similar manner been the great
factor in popularizing the 7 grid
game, and the growing in popular-
ity of .basketball on the. campuses
is. being reflected by. increased in-
terest in the .sport ..all, . oyer..„the
country. , ■ -
The , desire for" supremacy,' and
the competitive instinct are factors
which. cannot: be -neglected in pro-
mpting sports for. everybody. Re-
move the chance, to determine , the
champion in any. sport, and you re-
move one of the greatest incentives
to. participate,,in that sport.—The

Greater love no man hath, than
to lay down life for his adopted
daughter, unless it be for his moth-
er-in-law. ...“Strangers” stresses the
fact that even beneath the tattered,
shirt of a bar-room soak there may
beat a heart; of fourteen karat gold.
We firmly resolve henceforth to re-
spectfully ■ offer our seat in the
street- car to every down-and-outerf
shows at the Palace, the result
would be an encouraging upward
curve. While there is still room
for improvement, they’re getting
warmer—and who knows? The
next one might be pretty hot.
First in importance and last on
the program is the long-awaited
and. much press-agented Olga Myra,
with her Southland . Syncopaters.
Miss , Myra plays the violin well and
dances very cleverly, while attired
in a. costume designed to prevent
any cramping of her style. The
syncopaters are fairly good.
George Armstrong gives the im-
pression that he was just passing
by, and dropped in at the party to
sing a few songs. George has what
the character schools call “person-
ality, plus,” which, 'added to his
good voice and some , clever songs,
the performance.
And now we come to the mov-
ing picture. “Her Temporary Hus-
band” is a farce, and what’s more
it’s a-good one. The plot is thin,
the action is fast, and the laughs
are plentiful. What do you want
for 50 cents?	E. C.
Spring Weather Due
on St. Patricks Day
When does spring begin? is a
question that has been perplexing
many for years. The weather man
arid the almanac always disagree,
and “The White Plague,” winter, as
frequently upsets the calculations
of both.
And now another authority ap-
the natatorium swabber. “And
haven’t I been here long enough to
know. Just as sure as the 17th of
March is a holiday—I’m that con-
fident of what I say. Why, anyone
that’s read the life of St. Patrick
knows that he never was fond of
the cold. And if he wants any-
thing at all it’s a nice warm day for
his birthday. He was always a.man
that liked to fight against odds and
is there anything harder to. lick
than an Indiana winter?”
Mike’s claims will no doubt re-
ceive recognition among; the; stu-
dent body. Any theory is welcome
enough that promises to' convert
the white wastes of Indiana into; a.
verdant land between today and ,'the" -
;17th of March.	'
we see clutching a strap.
These courtroom scenes have, of
. late, blasted our faith in the ju-
dicial branch of the government.
We are-convinced that justice is not
only blind, but deaf and dumb as
well. The wrong man has. been con-
victed in eight out of ten cases by
actual count. Something should be
done about it at once.
This plot is out of the ordinary,
and succeeds in being fairly interest-
ing, in an 0. Henry sort of a way.
Betty Compson, Richard Dix, Lewis
Stone, and Tully Marshall compose
the cast. It looked good from the
outside, and after seeing it we
were able to corroborate our out-
side impression.
, The California Ambassadors are
lifted from the all-embracing class
of;“pretty good” by Irma and Lu-
cille Robertson, who, according to
Anna Pavlowa and Florence Zieg-
feld, are the cleverest stage chil- i
dren in "the business. You will ,
without doubt agree with Anna and
' Fid.' .	-

edy complete: the bill. ,

r Watson, the hammer! Rice and' “Sur% St
Werner prove , that it takes more day of spring, an i wo
than black faces and loud- stock- Orangeman to deny it, said Mike,;
ings to make an act funny. The
humor is very crude and. produces -
on the subject the sensation of be-
ing tickled by a shovel.

Prof. McGregor’s Talk
Thrills The Villagers
“If I could bring a football team
of Maori here, I assure you those
260-pound Islanders" would : show
Notre Danie a thing’ oy two in
straight football,” Prof; McGregor
told The Villagers at their monthly,
supper meeting held last night in
the Chamber of Commerce.
This traveled professor contrib-
uted several" other surprises in his
very interesting talk on the natives
and islands of Polynesia, treating
of his experience with the customs,
murderers, and fire-walkers of the
islands. This talk proved to be a
complete success and will serve as
the basis of comparison for future
dinner meetings. J
More than 30 members were
present. It was announced that
the next meeting would be Guest
Night. Non-important discussion
occupied the remainder of the
business part of the meeting.

originally set for it to' close. Only

the sale has been very lively, and
with the number of senior reserva-
tions . already made there is every
likelihood of being sold out. The

Tom Leib placed fourth in the
National A. A. U. championships
at New York last Friday. Tom’s
best effort sent the shot a distance
of 43.feet 61-2 inches. The win-
ner was Ralph Hills of Princeton,
who hurled the shot 47 feet, 11
inches for a new A. A.- U. record.
. The last refrain of a hectic bas-
ketball season in the. Big Ten cir-
cles will be delivered this week and
the Maroons up on the Midway al-
ready hear the tinkling of the. con-
ference basketball title. . .
• The Maroons have between them
and an undisputed title, the Fight-
ing Illini and the Badgers at Wis-
consin. Illinois and Wisconsin are
running, neck and neck for second
place, but with an evident ambition
to swamp the hopes of the Maroons.
Chicago has one remaining game
and that’with Wisconsin at Madi-
son. The Badgers in their own
gym and. with the home crowd, are
apt to put the Maroons on skids as
far as an undisputed title J goes.
But before that the Cardinals must
face the champs of last year from;
Iowa.’ ■	.	J .
: Chicago’s chances to take the
title are very good. The Maroons
have but one game to play and
have lost only three games all sea-
son. Wisconsin has two games
With a record of four losses behind
them. If Wisconsin can win her
two remaining games and see the
Maroons drop into the four loss
column, then there is going to be
much rejoicing in Madison. '
