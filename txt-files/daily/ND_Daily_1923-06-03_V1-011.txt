Tips Hurdle, in Day of
Much Bad Luck
By THOMAS COMAN
ANN ARBOR, Mich., June 2.—
The Notre Dame track team took
fifth place in the Western Intercol-
legiate track and field meet yester-
day at Ann Arbor, which was won
by the University of Michigan by
a score of 57 1-2, Illinois placing a
close second with 57 points.
The Irish tracksters were jinxed
from the start and hit by hard
breaks at nearly every turn of the
game. Captain Gus Desch failed
to qualify in the ’220-yard low
hurdles when he tripped over the
last hurdle while leading the field.
In the final heat of the low hurdles,
Brookins of Iowa raced over-the
timbers in .23 1-5, breaking the
world’s record. Wilson, also of
. Iowa, shattered the world’s mark in
the 220-yard dash, stepping the
course in 21 1-5. ,	■*
. - Breaks Other Way
The breaks of the day were all
in Michigan’s favor after Hubbard
leaped to fame in the broad jump
with a distance of 25 feet, 1 1-2
inches, for a new world’s record.
Wittman of the Wolverine was
clocked in the century for .9 :4. ;
Paul Kennedy, the Irish main-
stay-in the mile, run, met with the
greatest-misfortune, of his running
career. Paul had an easy race 'for
. the first lap and was running in
- ", great	a t
the start of the second quarter: and
was forced to take, the next half-
mile on his bare foot. Pained to
the extreme with a cinder-torn foot,
the gritty star’ was obliged to drop
out of the race at the start of the
last sprint, with the finish almost
: in sight Hair of Illinois crossed
- the tape in the slow time of 4:28:3.
Field Events.
Hogan tied for fifth in the broad
jump, and Tom Lieb placed second
in the discus throw. Liebj who
: broke the : state record last week
with a toss of 140 feet, was unable
.to better, the winning distance of
132 feet 91-2 inches. Dave Weeks
of Notre Dame gave a great per-
formance in the high jump, .by qual-
ifying at. 6 feet, 1 inch, and tying
for second place in the final, , won
by Smith of Michigan at 6 feet, 3
inches.,.
The javelin throw was won by
Angier, of Illinois, who bettered his
own conference record with a peg
of 198 feet, 10 1-4 inches. Oberst

NOTRE DAME DAILY
University of Notre Dame official daily paper, published every morning except

Colyum 0' Bits
By CLIFF WARD
Mr. Looking Glass, who propels
this motor bus to the apogee of
erudite intellection one day, while
condoning our intended descent into
insipid vacuity the next day, is a
man of no mean parts. One inex-
plicable inconsistency perturbs our
mental poise however. Why is he
termed a conductor the day he pi-
lots? Is this a mistake or a para-
dox?
Even in Siberian forests it is
known that the Looking Glass por-
trays and reflects most brilliantly
the passing show.. In it now and
then you see yourself with all the
deformities that a polished mirror
can create. Look at it and smile,
and it smiles back. Leer at it, and
it leers back. Ignore it, and it ig-
nores* you.
Mr. Kolars has committed one er-
ror, however, which this colyum
wishes to correct. On occasions
numerous and past, it has pleased
our adversary to refer to us as Mr.
Two Bits. Now we thank the worthy
gentleman for the panegyric but—
he has a Teutonic tendency to in-
flate currency, which is illegal and
uneconomic. A plugged nickel
would more conveniently fit the slot.
Our blood buckets and sand wagons,
we take, withdrawing from the
arena. Oh, Rodolf, you darling—
come do your stuff!
* * *
This colyum has ambitions neither
amorous nor intellectual. From its
posterior collar button to its occi-
pital tonsure it is in a status at-
rophy. However rising from a chair
after dictating to Nellie, our stenog,:
we noticed the Dome across the
road, very charmingly lifting its
head in a prayer for the salvation
of Notre Dame men. Just sort of
entre nous, Sisters, that particu-
larly aspiring piece of architecture;
is sorely in need of paint.
* * *
This space so carelessly wasted
is in receipt of a poetic amulet,
which we set upon the table for
your cardiac assimilation. The au-
thor of this verse is here honored
for singular intuition—having pen-
ned,.it _to _the^ more .fair ,and_less
reasonable species^’'which was'rare
judgment. Had it been adapted to
us, we would have searched every
psychopathic ward ■ in the country
till we revealed the culprit. This
outburst being resplendent with
thermal units, we must ask the fire-
man to giv$ us aid. Thanks.
Take your buckets, boys, and go
on home. We’ll have no more of
this, until the firemen’s convention
at Buchanan.
Mystical, loveable, sorrowful, sweet,
Wistful and pensive, still so discreet,
Cherish and love you, dream-scented rose,
Who could do other?—God only knows.
Fragrant with kisses of fairy sprites.
Warm with the winds of love-born nights,
Chariots angelic midst the sky’s azure hue,
Would suffer their beauty if likened to you.
, * * * •
This colyum wishes to let you in
on a secret. We promised we
wouldn’t tell a soul, and not being
Conan Doyle we didn’t, but we’ll
tell you. Mr. Richard Lightfoot
has revealed himself to the colyum
as the author of “Among Us Im-
mortals.” Mr. Lightfoot, compan-
ion in modesty with the Chicago
Tribune, the world’s greatest news-
paper, says his immortality is in no
way connected with his longevity
at Notre Dame. He wishes his pi-
lotship of that interesting colyum
which ran in the Scholastic all this
year, known, and he also says
he wishes to apologize for all
wise cracks, and to accept thanks
for all free and complimentary
publicity therein given. Although
Mr. Lightfoot was a good colyum-
ist we are certain no one will deny
that the conductor of this colyum
towers head and shoulders above
him at all times.
* * *
Tc the Readers:
We feel that we owe you an apol-
ogy for the vitriol that leaked into
yesterday’s column. The column
is written all in good fun, and in
passing we might call your atten-
tion to the “Colossal Insult” that
we ourselves handed the journalists
in a recent number. Concerning
the feelings of the law boys in gen-
eral we are not at all dubious. We
know that they are good sports.
There is, we believe, no more to
say about the thing. . . . Send
in the banter. We love it. . But no’
more direct ill feeling will find its
way onto this page. We have tried
it and the results were not at all
desirable. . . .	—F. T. K.
Application for entrance as second class matter at the post office at Notre Dame,
Indiana is pending.

DRIVERS AND PEDESTRIANS
Words are but vehicles for the expression of thought and may
often carry riders beyond the point intended. The locomotive power
of printed words is, to the new pilot, strangely powerful. The inertia
of these Packard trucks startles the man who has previously driven
1909 Fords. He will often pass his destination before he learns to
operate the new maqhine skilfully and accurately, before he learns how
to stop at the exact point intended.
Those who watch the voyages often mistake the intention of the
chaulfeurs. A certain musical critic recently expressed a criticism in
the Daily. It has been said that the critic aimed his vehicle at a
person. This is untrue, though it may be true that his words may have
passed their mark. All things considered, he may have better aimed
his words so that there could have been no chance of offense, even
though none was surely intended.
Another pilot did bump a man as he journeyed along. Police
-officers," of-all men,"must-mot bc-bumped-by. men .who-drive: cars-^-that
is dangerous^ As a matter of fact, men must never be hit by news-
paper chauffeurs except in case of fair and true criticism or comment
about persons of things before the public. Even in such cases, how-
ever, criticism is better aimed at acts than men. In this case such was
intended, but truthfully, such was not expressed.
The Daily endeavors to travel the course laid out in its first issue.
In the rush of a strange car over new roads, some sign posts may be
missed, but never purposely, for the drivers are sincere- and want to
aid the Daily to realize its one purpose, the welfare of Notre 'Dame,
institution, students, and faculty.
BUYING ESTEEM E
In spring, at Notre Dame, a young man’s fancy turns to politics.
Spring has become the molting season for political ambitions. During
the open season, as specified by the S. A. C. the eligibles come forth
from their hibernacula properly incubated politically, and strut their
stuff. Every motion is significant. An invitation to dinner, to take a
hike or to enjoy a casual walk is freighted with possibilities. Those
endeavors are part of the technique. They constitute a method of
getting perspective on the potential vote—to see where you stand. And
such methods are perhaps justified on the canon of results for many a
race has been won in a walk.
Just as long as men like to rule there will be politics. As long as
men differ in opinion there will'be parties and ofganizaitons. But is
the extreme intensity of feeling engendered by promoters justified or
at all necessary?
After all is it worth while?. What, is the actual worth of any
position in the realm of college politics? Any position is supposed to
represent the esteem and good will'of fellow students. Then isn’t it
paradoxical to organize and spread dissension, mar friendships, and
generate rancor for the sake of any position ? What will be more valu-
able in'the future;—the fact that you have gained a position by playing
upon the credulity of your associates at a sacrifice of principle on your
part, or the good will and sound confidence of your collegiate contem-
poraries based upon sound principle properly lived up to?
Any ambition is lawful except that which vaults from unprincipled
; technique cunningly executed. What, will it profit you to gain all the
positions if at the same time you sacrifice, the good will of a large
portion of your fellows? Perhaps that is the price one pays for leader-
ship, but one-is inclined to believe that it is the price paid for the
wrong kind of leadership.
CIDER EDUCRS
, IT’S THE OLD STORY
(Daily Kansan)
Another year has rolled by and
the old Alma Mater soon will grad-
uate a large class of virile young
men and women-into other fields of
work. In .two weeks the capped
and gowned procession of candi-
dates for the various degrees will
form in the roadway between Green
Hall and Fraser, and after suffering
rheat and discomfort from standing
will catch step and slowly wend
their formal way to the age old
ceremony—Commencement.
It is of little consequence to un-
derclassmen, but to the student ’who
has worked, hard in the University
and earned his degree through four
years of constant labor, it,is a dif-
ferent problem. Commencement is
his last remembrance of college life.

Sleepy Sickness Has
Come Upon Campus
The sleepy sickness has come
upon Notre Dame. That dreaded
malady, annually affecting this
green campus, has spread rapidly
with the warmth of the last few
days. The colds and pneumonia of
the winter months are gone, but
this even more wide-spread infec-
tion is affecting men in every class.
The worst effects are noticed dur-
ing the three and four o’clock
classes. The symptoms are gener-
ally yawning, and yearning gazes
out of classroom windows.
' Professors have been unable to
combat the disease and say time
and frequent quizzes are the only
means they can call to mind.
FOR COMMENCEMENT
Gerald J. Daily. Jr., Ph. B in
Commerce ’21. of Muskogee, Okla.,
is, a visitor on the campus and in-
tends to remain thru Commence-
ment Week.

Bennett, of '97, Tells of the
Yells That Won Ball
Games Here
“They don’t yell like they used to.
We used to win games by rooting.”
James J. Bennett, Notre Dame
man of ’97, who was at Notre-Dame
Wednesday, made this comment on
the Michigan game.
“Oura old yell: ‘N, hoor-ah, D.,
hoor-ah, N. D., hoor-ah,’ wasn’t
heard out there at the game,” he
said. “Maybe you don’t use that
yell anymore.”
Mr. Bennett felt that the spirit
of his days wasn’t here any longer.
It was suggested that the separa-
tion of so many men from the cam-
pus may have had something to do
with it, and he agreed. “But the
place looks good,” he said, “and you
are doing many more things and
better things than we used to do,
and I thought we had a smart
bunch.”
Mr. Bennett is now with the
Southern Schoolbook Depository, of
Memphis, Tenn.

CASTNER TURNS
DOWNOFFERS
Tigers, Browns, White Sox
Senators after Him; Castner,
To Enter Business
Paul Castner, captain of the
: Notre Dame baseball team, has re-
’ ceived many offers from big league
teams. Big league scouts have been
watching him since he pitched his
first varsity game here three years
ago.
The Detroit Tigers offered a con-
tract last year, but he wished to
continue his studies and refused.
The Chicago White Sox, and Champ
Clark of the Washington Senators
offered him a- place on the pitching
staff. The St. Louis Browns tried
many times to have him sign on the
dotted line.
Castner has turned down the of-
fers because of business. He has
been offered a good business oppor-
tunity and it is likely he will ac-
cept. Castner’s time will be taken
up entirely with business after June
and it is doubtful whether he will
have any time to give to athletics
at all.
• Castner has starred in athletics
at Notre.Dame for three years.. He
played varsity football and was the
mainstay of this year’s team.
He organized hockey here, was
captaim :of the first team and is
considered the most brilliant player
in the west.
Castner. has, plenty of steam, a
good and varied delivery and keeps
the base runners close to the bags,
is a heavy hitter, a fast fielder and
takes his place . in the gardens
' ■ when not hurling.
If by some chance Castner does
enter the big leagues, the team that
secures his services will have a
splendid all-around player.
IRISH FIFTH AT ANN ARBOR
(Continued from page 1)
and Moes of Notre Dame took sec-
ond and third in this event.
Montague’s Great Race
John Montague of Notre Dame,
,.. running anchor man of _ the Irish
' relay team/gave'one of "the greatest
speed performances of the day in
the)mile relay. -Montague took the
baton twenty feet behind the field
flashed around the course in a won-
derful sprint,’ passing three men
and flashing across the finish in
fifth place.
Johnson of . Illinois, won the high
hurdles in ;15:2. Some delay was
caused here when the officiasl at-
tempted to’ run the hurdles over
again, but Johnson refused to're-
. - ■ peat the event and Illinois withdrew
. from the meet. The difficulty was
finally settled and Illinois’returned
to the field.
The intercollegiate track classic
was run: off on a lightning fast
track and despite the intense hAat
•. x ■ of the day a crowd of 10,000 people
turned out to. witness the record-
breaking contest.
McTiernan and Montague failed-
to qualify in the 440 and Lieb and
Flynn were unable to make the
mark in the shot put trials. A.
Walsh and Luke Walsh also failed,
to qualify in their events. Sweet
of Illinois, took the quarter in .48:1.
Vallely of Wisconsin stepped the
half mile in 1:55. Isabell of Mich-
igan won the two mile run in the
fast time of 9:41.
The. Notre Dame tracksters will
be pitted against several former
champions, who are with the Chi-
cago I. A. C. Among them are Pope
in the discus, Ray Watson famous
miler who has beaten Joie Ray on
two occasions, Anderson and Rosen
in the hurdles and Coffee in the
sprints. Later in the day, the Irish
diamond squad will meet the Uni-
versity of Illinois.
