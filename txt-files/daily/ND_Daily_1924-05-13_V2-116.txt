IS SUCCESS; 500
ATTEND.
The giving of the Studebaker se-.
dan to Miss, Genevibve Smith, 601
Lincoln Way West, Mishawaka, by
Mrs. D. L. Guilfoyle was the fea-
ture of the May dance of the Schol-
arship club held last night at the
Palais Roy ale. The event was very
successful, according to one of the
officers of the club, both in ‘the
matter of tickets sold on the Stude-
baker and that of the. dance itself.
More than 250 couples danced to
the music of two orchestras. The
Big Five of the Hotel LaSalle al-
ternated with Jack Warr’s Palais
Royale.band. '	,
Besides the ; members of the
Scholarship club itself there were
more than. 20 of South Bend’s
prominent families assisting . as
patrons and patronesses. The club-
women chaperoned a number of
South Bend/young, ladies that were
guests of the club. f ;
The dance itself was one of the
most enjoyable Scholarship dances
given this, year, according 'to ( the
reports of the dancers. The bright
colors of . the gowns worn: by the
girls gave the, dance floor the ap-.
pearance of a . kaleidoscope and
made . the occasion . comparable, to
one ofthe succesful class dances.
Plans for the initiatory work to
be conferred on a class of candi-
dates Thursday night will be com-
pleted- at the regular meeting of
Notre Dame Council, Knights of
Columbus tonight. Final arrange^-
ments will also be made for the
exemplification of the second and
third degrees next Sunday at Mish-
awaka.
An attractive entertainment pro-
gram, which . includes a talk by
Father William Bolger, of the econ-
omics department, and various
musical selections, will follow the
business session. . Refreshments
will be served.	' . .

Notre Dame blasted the diamond
hopes of another conference nine
yesterday when the Irish defeated;
the Purple squad from'Northwest-,
ern, 9 to 4, on Cartier field. Notre
Dame featured the - game with
heavy stick work, counting at least
one run in all but four innings.
...The. coaches of both teams in-
jected two pitchers into the game
to prevent the; contest becoming a
free swinging affair, although Joe
Dawes had the better, of the mound
battle before he was relieved by
McGrath. . Shultze, starting on the
slab ■ for the Purple managed to
count three strike outs before going
to the bench. Pulley who supplant-
ed him for Northwestern, was cred-
ited with only one strike out. Dawes
weakened in the fourth when he
walked. three men in succession.
With the bases full and two out,
Dempsey; flied out ?-to Vergaraj
whose catch robbed the Purple of
at least three runs.	■	/.
Notre Damfe opened with two
runs in the first frame and added
another in.ithe fourth. Three more
in the sixth and two in the seventh
raised the count to’ eight and one
added in the eighth .finished the
scoring at nine counters. North-
western broke into the scoring col-
umn in the sixth when the Purple
gathered foui* runs on three hits/
During ' the first five innings, , the
nusraTr^found’^^	'in
landing a man on first and five
strike. outs' by Dawes supplemented
by excellent • fielding did not help
the Evanston squad .to any great
extent. The Purple . were still
fighting when McGrath, took up the
pitching burden ?in the .fifth, and
after.getting acquainted with Notre
Dame’s diminutive twirler, the Pur-
ple invaders came up. in /the sixth
and tapped him? for four runs on
three .hits, a three-bagger and ah
error favoring • Northwestern \with
remarkable effectiveness. Captain
Sheehan encountered,a bad after-
noon in the \ field, being credited
with; two’bobbles and a: wild throw.
When at bat, the jinx of the after-
noon still pursued him and four
of the five times at bat, saw Pur-
ple outfielders scoop inj^his long
drives?- The Irish leader .made up
for the errors, however,;in a flash

COMIC OPERA
PACKED HOUSE DEMANDS
ENCORE FOR EACH
NUMBER.
. “The. Lass of Limerick Town,”
presented in Washington hall last
night by St. Patrick’s choir of Chi-
cago, proved to be one of the most
entertaining as welL as worth-while
productions, that.' has appeared
here in the last several years.- Be-
ing a romantic comic, opera by
Arthur A. Penn, ithe lyrics and
music were excellent and a-capable,
well-trained cast kept a full, house
in-a continual up-roar of laughter
and applause. It is remarkable that
not a single musical number was
sung .that did not necessitate an
encore.:	:	. ■
If the singing was good it was
because of the individual ^excellence
.of^the' voices^
jjeWis: Browiie "was the musical di-
rector of the play and credit for
the artistic musical effects shown
in the . solos and choruses’must go
tox him'. Miss Sarah > McCabe, cast
in the role of Betty . McCoy, was
easily the star 'of the show with
her. charnj of-manner and the sweet-
ness of her clear soprano .voice.
Miss Marie Belka, the cousin .of
Rose McCoy, played, the other, lead-
ing feminine. role in a creditable
mariner, singing especially well in
several duets. /	• ■ /	'
Ward H. Pound was largely re-
sponsible for the success of the
production as-; a whole, for he
staged it and took the leading male
part, that of the gallant young Cap-
tain Pomeroy Worthington. > Pound

circles and possesses a tenor voice

sively defeated Arthur. Bidwell, of
Chicago. Brady ,a student in the
Science school,, is very popular and
capable. Jim Silver polled more

ceed “Gov.”, who is the present
officer, next September. Silver is
a Varsity catcher and well-known -
and liked upon the campus. . He.
hails from Perth Amboy, New Jer-’
sey, and is in the College of Com-
merce. He is .quiet, a good^student,
and will undoubtedly prove efficient.

with wording panelled in gold and
bearing the seaL of the unversity,
has a section of ^wonderful campus
views.. in green and brown . tones
which atone are sufficient' to make
it a . remarkable, artistic triumph.
The; engraving work bn these views,
bringing out th e. lights and shadows
in an unlooked {for clearness, does
much to set this; section off. / ■ , ;

. In' dedicating the book-to Rev.
Matthew Walsh, president of .the
university,: the following tribute is
paid: “A noble priest,’ .a splendid
patriot ' and .-.a generous ~friend, Fa-
ther; Walsh typifies most magnifi-
cently that: absolute. spirit of sac-
rifice and endeavor, \and that - sol-
idarity of interest.. upon which
Notre Dame has been /builded., It
is only proper that the? high point
in the growth and glory of our
university should have been reached
under: his administration. ’ Notre
Dame men will ever strive for; a
place in the great‘heart of Father
Walsh, and that heart i is,/deep en-
ough to hold, them all.” -
'The “Administration”, chapter, of
the book is made-different by the
inclusion , of numerous views taken
, in the1 classrooms, the laboratories,
the court rooms and the shops.
■ Senior write-ups are. in short
paragraph form, preceded by a short
summary of the activities in ’which'
the graduating student participated.
The write-ups are free from rep-
etition, a condition yery likely to
exist when.more.than 200 such par-
agraphs, must be prepared. Silhou-
ette views of the juniors are an-
other novel feature. ’
• In the: athletic section the editors,
have employed a-clever scheme to
include many pictures, of the var-
ious games and contests by using
a “news reel” which begins on the
first page devoted to,. each' sport
and flows along as a bottom border
oh air succeeding pages,, to run into

What Others Say
The Changing World.
A cartoonist, famous the world
over, on the staff of one of Amer-
ica’s greatest newspapers, chooses
frequently as the field of his work,
a portrayal of “The Changing
World.” Each week he draws more
pictures showing just how the world
has changed. Sometimes for the
better, often for the worse, change
seems to be inevitable.
But such is not always the case.
He could with equal ease draw
moi4e pictures labeled “The; Un-
changing World.” Certain customs
and institutions change, but human
nature and its manifestations have
not changed in twenty centuries.
Love, hate, pity, rivalry—all seem
as eternal as the universe itself.

of the production of the club’s an-
nual opera, “That’s That,” was
copied from his, “Booklovers,” the

' MAJOR MARTIN REPORTS
“Awaiting instructions.” .	.	. -	/ .	'	.
These two words, ending a message which brought news twelve
days in coming, are typical of the courage of American airmen. . Major
Martin had reported, safe and sound/
-	/	. It_wasonlya_short tiineagothat the flyers took off on the first
"V leg’ of" their w6rld/trip7~ahd^^hdfter~time "fliat' we read "of-Majin*
Martin’s thrilling start on his flight from Kanatak to Chignik. Down
the narrow .creek, the branches of trees and brush threatening at
'every moment1 to tear the wings of his plane, until .finally he took
off into a blinding snowstorm.	x	• ,
And then no report for days and days after he left Chignik.
Washington feared for his safety and sent his fleet ahead. American
. , vessels, in Alaskan waters took up the search. Meanwhile Martin
had struck a mountain in the fog, demolishing his plane, and -throwing
/him . and his mechanician upon their, own resourses. They, worked
their way to a trapper’s lodge and reported.	'	.
There is adventure in this ,story of Major Martin, adventure
that makes fiction tame in comparison.' If you delight ' in books or
movies, get a metropolitan paper carrying <a complete report of the
Martin story and you will be thrilled by the work,of this modern-day
adventurer, and you will learn something, of history in the making.
-• THE, CLIMATE '
.The climate is of prodigious importance. This importance, although
huge when considering- health, germs, bugs and bacilli, leaps to an I
elephantine diniension when we take a clean swing at the correct
pronunciation of the verb or adverb “acclimated”. If you live
jn good old, unpretentious 'Iowa br Wisconsin you simply become
acclimated, with the accent on the “cli”, hut if you live in New York
or California, and' have money, there is a healthy note of “ac” in
your’acclimatization. .	'	,	/	,
It’s harder to pronounce'it that way^ but then, its harder to
Jive that way, for a climate wears j but and you are always moving
to another one. A really good climate is never near, because you
have to move to it. As soon as you Iiave enough money (or get' some
stylish .illness) to pronounce the word with a robust “ac”, then you
may go and seek climate. This is related to economics in that'it
keeps railroads going, and railroads, in return create climates—after
you have the-money for a, ticket.
' Some people have become so adept at.judging climates that .they
can tell a 'good one merely by measuring the length of a railroad
ticket. But some day some, one will circle the. globe'and end up
where, he started in his search for a climate.. Then we wonder what
will happen. .	\	:	, ;	/
z < Indiana; and Notre Dame have no climate in particular—so don’t
knock it. Study hard while you arc here and some . day you may
:	go to one.
“A Son of the- Hidalgos,” by
Richard Leon; Doubleday Page and
Co., New York. $1.75. ,
Unfortunately it sometimes hap-
pens that a good book is forgotten
too soon or neglected altogether.
Such 'a one is Richard Leon’s “A
Son of the Hidalgos” which cannot
be forgotten because it was never
known in this country where the
only Spanish writer people care to
read is Blasco^Ibanez, pamphleteer,
propagandist : and dime novelist
who, like Anthony Trollope, ap-
parently turns out his chapters ; oh
a time schedule. ’ '	/
Santillana del Mar, “a venerable
elic of ancient Spain, a place of
poetry and silence,” is the scene
in which Leon places his hero, “of
the race of Gil Blas, dreamer, rebel,
poet and lover.” “Here ten cent-
uries look out upon us with the
vacant' staring , eyes of the dead;
here, they' speak to us of .life and
'of~3eath7TegeAd'^
and virtue, high thinking and noble
doing. Here are the Middle Ages,
symbolized in the slender, dreamy,
Santa Iliana, incarnation , of the
heroic, adventurous, - phssionate,
mysticism of that iron age of Chris-
tianity.” :	’	-
Not only is “A Son of the Hidal-
igos” a good story of a descendant
of Don Quixote, the last of his race,
blindly, seeking his place in the
world, casting aside religion, em-
bracing the.foibles of the day, and
then finding consolation in his re-
turn to the faith and the land of
his fathers,.-But it embodies the
poetry of history and the poetry
of legend with clarity that aprcach-
es perfection. And it.would be hard
to .find, even in the most ambitious
works of any of Richard Leon’s
contemporaries, in his own country
or elsewhere/ as delicately beautiful
a piece of prose as the sweep , of
Spanish history in the dream \of
Pedro when the soul-scarred man
sees', passing before ''him the. Cid,
Ferdinand and Isabella, Santa Il-
iana,* St. Francis, Don Inigo,. the
mirror of gallant knighthood t and
of the wit and learning ,of fifteenth
century: Castile, and his own pro-
totype, Gil- Blas. .'
. It is a book of the type of “Maria
Chapdelaine” and “Abbe ' Pierre”
but. with the; difference* that, it is
written with . an' artistic vision
which, the authors of these books
could not attain. Those who found
in /these two volumes some respite*
from the publications made popular
by the gentry who give the public,
what, it wants-—whether it wants
it or not—will find in this “true
story of suffering souls, living things
wet with warm and human tears,”
truths to ponder overhand ip ac-

Brutus,' Caesar, Antony, struggled
for the supremacy of the Roman
government. Today, Republican
and Democratic clubs are^ being]
formed in every college, with both
sides preparing for a struggle next
fall that .would make the great
Caesar green‘ with envy. Back in
the days when Alexander was a
small boy, the long haired patri-
archs worried about the' coming
generation. Nowdays, that, worry
is still present complicated by mod-
ern developments of which Alex-
andrians were ignorant—perhaps!
And vthe'younger generation is .still
worrying about the backwardness
and conservatism of the older!
The world changes in methods
used, but not in. the underlying

HOW BEAUTIFUL THE WORLD
■ ' -Theodore .Roosevelt, that synondmous figure, for robustness and.j
joy of living, was very short sighted and had to wear glasses when-!
ever possible. In commenting on this necessity he remarked, epi-
gramatically, something which will always 'live. It was:
; ' “I had no idea how beautiful the .world- was until I got .these
- . spectacles.”' ■	.	;
• Here is a blow at the dreamer. One who is shbrt sighted in
mind, who prefers to see . only the most ?gaiidy^outstanding aspects'
; of the1 picture of living, is. truly' unfortunate. He has' never known
how beautiful the world is. May he get spectacles! .	:

Illinois Next on
Notre Dame Card
Following the decisive victory
over • Northwestern, which 'marked
the vanquishing of another Confer-
ence team by the Keoganites, the
Notre Dame nine will begin prepar-
ations for Illinois, the. conference
leader, the game to be played at
Urbana next Friday.
The Illinois engagement calls up
the ancient rivalry which exists be-
tween the two schools. Illinois
with an undeniable ability to de-
velop winning ball clubs to repre-
sent the sucker school on the dia-
mond has .enjoyed victory in a ma-
jority of the games played between
the two schools. Last year Notre
Dame went to Urbana and with the
inimitable “Lefty” O’Connor on the
mound for the Suckers, the Irish
were let down with a no-hit no-run
defeat./ The powerful Illinois nine
appeared on Cartier field for a spec-
ial game > at Commencement last
June expecting to duplicate the vic-
tory hung up in.the earlier part of
(the season. Castner appeared on
the mound for Notre Dame before
a mammoth throng of Commence-
ment guests and chalked up a vic-
tory over Illinois.
This year Coach Lundgren has an
equally powerful nine and has'thus
far retained the conference lead in
partnership with Michigan. Had the
game with Michigan and Ohio State
not been called off because of rain,
the calibre of the Illini squad
would . undoubtedly be : better
judged. Both the Wolverines and
Ohio State boast of top notch base-
ball nines such as the conference
has produced this year, and a full
. time game with the Illinois would
have gone, a long way toward ascer-
taining whether. or not the Indians
had titular, capabilities.
The game between Notre Dame
and Illinois will be the first. of
a two-game card for Illinois, the
-second-game-bf-^VYhich‘^
with Wisconsin the following day.
Both games will be coupled , with
the Illinois-Michigan track meet as
features of the Illinois interschol-
astic track carnival on the Urbana
cinders.
' Coach KeOgan will utilize the
week preparing his- team for the
conflict,, with the Suckers which will
be followed by a game with St.
Viators, at Chicago on Saturday.
The Chicagoans are reputed to have
a fast \ball club and have already
defeated Loyola, the scrappy north
side team.
TOURNEY GOES TO JACK
ADAMS IN EASY FASHION.
, Jack Adams, premier golfer of
the University, added another tri-
umph to, his list of many notable
victories when he won the annual"
- Blow Out tournament, at the Chain
O’Lakes, golf course Sunday after-
noon. Adams won over Fred Fish-
er of LaPorte in the champion
flight,' the final being 8 up and 6
to play. •	,
. Adams displayed his champion-
ship form when he gathered a huge
lead for himself 'at the very outset
of the championship round. He
won the first five holes and con-
tinued to increase his lead from
there on. '.Norman Feltes also had
a walkaway in the finals-of".Class
C" flighty defeating Midgrey, 8 to 7.
The surprisingly good showing
made by the Notre Dame golf team
on the local links against North-
western last Friday, will have its
effect this week-end when the Irish
journey to Chicago to meet De Paul
and Loyola.
Expecting to meet competition
just as good if not better than
Northwestern, the local team is de-
•yoting much time toward prepara-
tions for the coming matches. Both
the Chicago schools have a decided
advantage over the Notre Dame
club in the way of practice matches
and large coteries of star golfers
to choose a team from. Notre
Dame, though, possesses seven men
who have displayed remarkable abil-
ities on the green and will in no
way be embarrassed by the smart
competition of the Chicagoans.
Notre Dame is due to meet De
Paul on Thursday and Loyola on
Friday, but. arrangements made by
De Paul to travel on Thursday may
put the match off till Friday in
which .case the Loyola match will be
played Saturday. ’ The card calls
for match play for eighteen holes
and five of the following seven men
will be chosen to make the trip:
Adams,' Ward, Mouch, Corbett,
Bulger, Foglia and Harris.
UPSETS FEATURE OPENING
ROUND OF GOLF _TOURNEY.
Results of the University golf
tournament which were given out
last night by George Ward, man-
ager of the tourney, reveal some
unexpected upsets' in the' campion-
ship flight. Russel McClure de-
feated Joseph Foglia, 3 'up and 2
to go, in one of the best games
played on the Municipal links' this
year. Foglia played : a ' fighting
game but the work ^of .McClure
bested the varsity golfer before the
finish of the match. McClure turned
in two scores of 35 each.
-^ Jinf .' Corbett'’"' another '^varsity'
player lost to James Judie, 2 up.
This match like the McClure-Foglia
match, was ah exceptionally good
game. ” Jack Adams, the golf , lum-
inary of the-University won over
Arthur Klide in easy fashion, 4
up and 3 to go. .Ward defeated
Robuski, 4 up and 2 to go. . Bulger
defeated Miles Ryan, 4 up and 2 to
go. All the pairing of the first
round have been played, off with the
exception of Joe DeLeo apd Frank
Breslin, which match will be played
today., .
The winner of the following
matches will go to the semi-finals
McClure v. Bulger, Ward v. Harris,
Link v. Adams. The following are
some of the results of the first
round of Class A: Thomas won over
Romweber, 2 up and 1 to go., Furey
defeated" Hanousek, 3 up and 1 -to
go?. Prince defeated ’ Gallagher, 4
up and.3 to.go. Corboy.won over
Novesky, 1 up. Barr won over Ed-
mondson, 3 up and 1 to go. Barry

IRISH GOLFERS TO MEET
DePAUL AND LOYOLA TEAMS
Jack Adams Elected
Irish Golf Leader
.Jack Adams, star golfer on the.
Notre Dame golf team -was elected
to "captain the team of 1924, at
a meeting of the squad yesterday.
The following members of the team
were present at the meeting: Char-
ley Mouch, George Ward, John
Bulger, Joseph Foglia, Dan Harris
and James Corbett. :
Adams is a sophomore. in Com-
merce whose home is in Montclair,
New Jersey.* For the past two
years, the star has been the shining
light of the Notre Dame golf team.
Adams has gone beyond the ranks
of the varsity squad and won hon-
ors and titles for himself in tourna-
ments held on the South Bend links.
He won the City Invitation tourna-
ment last fall and the Blow Out
tournament last’ Sunday, tn addi-
tion to this he finished a winner
in the championship flight of the
University golf tournament last
spring and is at present defending
his title in the 1924 tourney.,
NAPPANEE SIGNS FALVEY.
Dick Falvey, former, star twirler
of the Notre Dame Jjaseball club,
was signed last week to pitch for
the Nappanee nine. Falvey who
became famous at Notre Dame when
he pitched a shutout game against
Iowa in 1923, and then knocked a
home run in the twelfth to give
Notre Dame the game, 1 to 0,
was given a trial with the White
Sox this spring. His work was re-,
ceived favorably and he *was. sent
to Texas' to pick up experience.
While playing with ; the southern
team, his arm was injured and he
left the' Texas league and returned
north. He twirled his opening
game against Elkhart last Sunday,
winning 5 to 4.	\	,

On the Level
The Memorial Day week-end will
be featured by a variety of athletic
activities for the midwestern sport
enthusiast. Gibbons and Carpen-
tier will be the attraction at Mich-
igan City in a 12-round fight,
the class of the American' automo-
bile race drivers will burn • up the
bricks at Indianapolis for 500 miles,
the - Olympic candidates will run
trials at Ferry field, Ann Arbor,
and Notre Dame will meet Michigan
on the Wolverine’s diamond.
Which way was the “Indian sign”
pointing last Saturday, when Iowa
beat Chicago, 9 to 7? The score
at the end of the eighth was 2 to
1 in favor of the Maroons. At
the end of the ninth, it was 9
to 7, in favor of Iowa.
That would have been a bad game
for the bookies had they , not for-
seen that the Maroon’s infield in-
cludecl several aviators who kept
the ball in the air while eight low-
ans rode across the plate and that
in Chicago’s half of the ninth, Mc-
Guire would fan out with three
men on the path and two away.
It appears in recent reports
from the Olympic games now be-
ing staged in Paris that the rivalry
between the Americans and the
French is growing' by leaps and
bounds. French spectators are boo^
ing the American athletes in action
while the latter are saving their
best men for the encounters with
the French teams.	s

The Parisians booed the Amer-
icans while the latter were defeat-,
ing Roumania at rugby. The
French movie concerns wanted ex-
clusive rights-to take pictures of
the teams in action which was set-
tled after the Americans balked, by
permitting American camera men to
take pictures, of the games. In-
cidentally, some Frenchman left the
stadium where the American team
was playing carrying with him,
clothes, money and other valuables
belonging to the Yankees. Is this
what they call French leave?

Hollocher’s return to the Cub 1
infield last week was one of the
big surprises that have come up
in the majors since the season
opened. “Holly” was a confirmed
hold-out, so the dopesters said, but
the call of the diamond must have
been stronger than the jingle of
$4,200 which the short field star
says was due to him from" his con-
tract of 1923?

Game for Championship of Senior Law Class
, Lawyers. battled -lawyers, on the
Brownson baseball diamond instead
of in a., court room, however, when
the members of the - Senior* law
class "played their annual baseball
game for. the " class championship,
yesterday afternoon. Just which
team won the privilege . of repre-
senting the Senior class in other
interclass contests remains in doubt,
since it was found expedient to post-
pone the remainder of the game
after ari hour, and a half had been
spent in finishing two and one half
innings.. The Challengers, who
were leading, the Regulars, 12-9,
when the game was called, claim
the victory, but the . Regulars pro-
test that the game cannot be con-
sidered legal, inasmuch as four and
a half innings were not played. It
is' planned to argue this technicality
iri moot court, with Dean Frank T.
Konop, who officiated as umpire,
presiding. .	...
All the features which go to make
up a big league game were there,
and in addition there were others
highly original. Both pitchers were
a- trifle wild at tiriies, and the' fre-
quent use of the “bean” ^all re-
quired a great deal of agility^ on the
part of the batters to escape in-,
jury. In the course of the game-
five players were unable to dodge
the ball, and received it in various
parts of their anatomy, the head
and neck apparently being favored
most. The game was marked by
heavy hitting and loose fielding,
the fielders apparently being in early
season form. John O’Donnell,
playing for the .regulars, distinguish-
ed himself by getting three hits in
as many times to the plate, one of
his drives going into the box office
window of Cartier field. ' DeGurse.
Shaughnessey and Scoggins led the.
hitting foi* the Challengers, each
batting 1000., .	’
Dean Konop acted as umpire at
the plate, and his decisions met with
popular approval. The Dean took
particular care to avoid any argu-
ment about the number of strikes
and balls by marking down each
decision on paper. On the i .
casions when the fans considered
his judgment faulty, Dean Konop.
exhibited a gift of firmness and res-
oluteness . that" would have done
credit to a “big time” umpire. Bob
Curry arid JohnMcMullen acted
as bas$ umpires.	.■
