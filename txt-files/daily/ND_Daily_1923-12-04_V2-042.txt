Good morning! Was your Mon-

,ne of the brightest in weeks, for,

hese ’wanderings over sordid soil.

who of late have frolicked on the

ball. The letter points out that I
am peculiarly fitted/ because of my

light of attention upon: players who
so well merit it. Surely here is a
field that'our sport editor has over-
looked. I can have my own “All-

doughty touch football warriors
have, interested friends.. Let them

day; Subscription for “The
Shield” Being Solicited.
The local unit of the Catholic
Students’ Mission Crusade is in-
augurating a campaign for new
members and next- week will be
known as “C. S. M. G. Week.”
The Catholic Students’ Mission
Crusade is a body of Catholic stu-
dents organized "to win the world
to Christ.” From an humble and
modest beginning the' movement has
advanced until at present it has as-
sumed national proportions. At the
convention held at Notre Dame this
summer there were delegates from
almost every state in the Union,
several from Canada, and even for-
eign lands were representedi.
The Notre Dame unit will increase
its membership in order to carry on'
better the work which it'has al-
ready done for the success of the
Crusade movement.
After a successful run in the East
the Notre Dame convention pictures
have returned to the Middle West.
They will be shown in Washington
hall Saturday night, December 8.
Subscriptions for "The . Shield,”
the official publication of the C. S.
M. C., are now being taken on the
campus by a committee under
Chairman Gilbert Uhle. Men in
Bengal mission, will soon be put on
the Rectors to solicit subscriptions
for the "Bengalese,” the. organ of
the Holy Cross mission in Bengal,
India.

IRISH RESERVES
DEFEAT TOLEDO
3,500 Witness Game; Sullivan's
Punting Features; Geniesse -
and Stack Star.
Uncovering a whirlwind attack of
cross-bucks and forward passes that
completely overwhelmed all. opposi-
tion, the Notre Dame reserves de-
feated the University of Toledo, 13
to 0, in the Ohio city last Saturday
afternoon, before a crowd of 3.500
spectators.
Only once during the entire game
did»the Toledoians threaten the
Notre Dame goal line, when they
made a phenomenal dash down the
field by virtue of two passes that
netted them 28 yards and a series
of terrific line plunges. With the
ball on the Reserves’ 12-yard line,
the Irish braced and crushed the
only flash of power exhibited by
Coach Dwyer’s proteges during the
game.
The Rockmen’s backfield gained
off tackle and through the line al-
most at will and had an advantage
of 20 yards on every exchange of
punts. Geniesse at full back for
the visitors, plowed through the
center of the line for long gains,
time after time and. scored two
touchdowns. Friske, Stack and
Coughlin slashed off the tackles for
huge gobs of yardage that contin-
ually kept the ball moving toward
the Toledoians’ goal. “Red” Brown,,
who alternated at full back with
Geniesse, continued the ■ fast pace
set by his running mates and dove
over the line for another tally.
Stack and Friske each contributed
a touchdown to the score books,
but Stack was unable, to, make the
extra point after .touchdown that
was recorded 'during the~game; ~
The punting of: Sullivan and Stack .
was one of the features of, the
game and. their work assures the
varsity of some good kicking ma-
terial for next year. Sulliinan’s
punts were averaging about 45
yards, getting one; boot off for a
ride of 60 yards. :	•
The breaks of the’game featured
the last minute of play, when with
the ball on the Toledo 20-yard line,
Friske/went off tackle for a touch-
down. . Notre Dame was offside
and the ball was called back and
placed: on the 25-yard line. Again
Friske was called upon and he re-
peated his run of the previous play,
but once/more the Irish were off-,
side arid the score was not counted.
With the ball now on the 30-yard
line and a few seconds to play,
Friske < once more' took the oval
and ran to the one-yard line where
he. was down as the final .whistle
blew. :	’ .
Notre Dame completed four out
of five passes for a total gain of 80
yards. Toledo tried five passes and
completed two which netted them
28 yards on ,the only chance to
score. Notre Dame made 25 first
downs to five for Toledo.
Captain Stick was the only player
on the Toledo team that was -able
to make any gain against the Irish,
but his passes met with failure on
all but two tries and his kicks gave
Notre Dame the advantage every
time. •'
The entire attack, of the Reserves
smacked of the now famous decep-
tiveness that was accorded so much
praise on Rockne’s invasion of the
East. The entire backfield, - with
Finch at quarter, performed in true
Notre -Dame fashion and outclassed
the. Toledoans! in every department
of the game.
- The contest was played on a mud-
dy field, which hampered both teams
to some 'extent, but’ considering
the score, and -the ease with which
it was piled up, indicates the lack
of any great opposition on the part
of the Toledo school. F. W. 'White?
refereed the.game.
The! Toledo sport writers lauded
the work of the- Notre Dame Re-
serves.- They gave much credit to.
Stack and ^Geniesse and predicted
great things for Wade Sullivan.

’ THE CALL ,FOR KNIGHTS
The announcement in the Sunday issue of thb Daily that a large
class is expected for initiation into the Knights of Columbus is deserv-
ing of editorial comment. Catholic college graduates are looked upon
as leaders in their respective communities, and^they may best exercise
this leadership as members and officers of such an influential society
1 as the Kniglits of Columbus. The man who enters this order here at
school will become well acquainted with its principles, its activities and
its organization, so that when he identifies himself with his home coun-
cil he will already be fired with enthusiasm for the work which his
brother knights have been carrying on, and he will also be capable of
taking an active part in continuing that work..	'
Too frequently ^do prominent Catholics hesitate to become con-
nected with religious interests. Too seldom do we-find a case such as
that of a successful Catholic lawyer in a small city of the mid-west,
who is earnestly concerned about the affairs of the Knights of Colum-
bus and parochial responsibilities.
One day the lawyer was conferring with a church member while
another Catholic sat in an outer room, waiting for him to transact some
personal legal business. After a long wait the client jocosely re-
marked:	,	■,	■ .
“If Tom doesn’t get through with that K. of C. business pretty
soon I’ll be going to a good. Protestant, lawyer, begad I will.” .	.
Of course lie didn’t go to the other lawyer; but Tom would not
have cared if he had gone. He has frequently asserted that he has never
had occasion to regret the time that he has spent in the service of the
Church and the Knights of Columbus.
In the world today we need more’men who have the attitude of
this Catholic attorney,' and we believe that an active and interested
membership in the Knights of Columbus, in university life as well as
in after life, will do much to develop such men.

WSZOM
“Have vision without being visionary,” was the advice given to a
number of commerce and journalism-students in .a recent address of
. Mr.‘ Frank Arnold, an. authority on the subject of foreign trade and
advertising. Furthermore, this vision should , be. accompanied by the
acquisition of an international viewpoint, and a realization of the in-
fluence which America; may have in the feommercial world when it com-
prehends its own power, and when its business men act with a confi-
dence bbrn of the courage of conviction. ’ .	■ ? '	-
. The message must have .carried its appeal to everyone-who had the
opportunity.: of hearing Mr. . Arnold speak. But it is not the' com-
mercial man alone who stands in need of ; such advice. Any college
I student, even though uninterested in the subject of foreign advertising,
might have listened to this speaker with profit. .	.	,	.
It is not often that speakers tell iis anything that is absolutely
new; but they do present the-old topics in a new light br from a.differ-
ent angle, so as to arouse trains of thought leading to more definite and
far-reaching conclusions. Or they may-simply recall our attention'to
. interests that have, been neglected in the rush of everyday activities.
And it is perhaps in this latter sense that Mr. Arnold’s talk is
most- worthy of commendation. All college men are aware of the
' importance of the vision of which-Mr. Arnold speaks; but few of them
really seek to make such vision a definite goal. And without some
rational, planning,; without some sincere'consideration of the purpose'
of college^ life, vision may be as fleeting and as misleading as the desert
mirage.'	'	..
. Again, it is vision that removes the college graduate from the
ranks of the provincial and makes him a citizen of the nation. It is
vision that will enable him to represent his country in.the world wher-
ever and whenever such representation serves the interest of that coun-
try. Advances in transportation • and in communication, have? indeed
drawn the nations of the world closer together physically-; but, whether
it be in, commerce or in politics,: only an increase in the number of
leaders with; unselfish, vision, can bring them really close together in
spirit. ''	■’ A. <;	■.	■ -A ■..... . • . •.. ... ;

Dear Editor:
The letters of “Twenty-Four”
and “A. Senior” are as amusing as
the senior canes. Their impertinent
answers to the pertinent, though
sophomoric, question, of the Thurs-
day letter, show a lack of courtesy
and logic by hiding behind “papa
spank” phrases. I have no thought
of arguing the question which they
failed to answer. I think that a
noble and Christian training is
shown'by our fourth year class when
they decided that the voting for,
and the decorating of their walls
with, their grudges is carrying such
things far enough. What I object
to is the spirit of these anonymous
upperclassmen. 'That splendid
spirit of democracy, which we have
often thought existed at Notre
Dame, seems to have gone the way
of our late lamented and sup-
pressed spirits, and a new, bootleg
variety substituted by such as these
anonymous persons.
GERALD. HOLLAND.
“The Notre Dame seniors now
carry canes. It. seems almost^ la-
mentable that a great school,
famed for the democratic institu-
tions it has ever embraced,, should
present such a silly custom to the
Homecoming crowd as young men
who like to bq thought, very sophis-
ticated parading the campus with
all the airs and graces of your Eton
schoolboy. But ..then freshman
caps are: silly4 and so are ■ nine-
tenths of college .traditions. And
what is a college devoid of tradi-
tion?”—“The Viatorian.”, . ■

“Main Street” is good, take our
word for it. The picture does not
‘ contain a single big scene, but it
has a simple originality and an air
of sincerity that is bound to please.
Long years of sophistication had
made us suspicious of motion pic-
ture sentiment, but in this case we
admit that something slipped
through our. guard. Everything
happened so naturally and artless-
ly that only a confirmed doubter
would fail to be impressed. Flor-
ence Vidor helps matters along
with some very intelligent and
clever acting.
The stbry supplies, many oppor-
tunities for humor, and Louise Fa-
zenda overlooks none of them. As
the Swedish maid, she once again
sacrifices her. beauty to the art of
comedy, and her presence is a de-
cided asset to the picture.
VMain Street”, is the well direct-
ed film, adaptation of a good story.
It has the necessary probability,
comedy, and thrills for, good enter-
tainment. Go to see it at the Or-
more than that of the New York
U.; yet we like the Calendar of
Events on page one of the Eastern
sheet better than the Official Uni-
versity Bulletin hidden on page two
of the DAILY. The editorials are
as different as New York and South
Bend; they are just what one might
expect. “Let us be more intimate
with each other,” says the Eastern-
er; “Say hello to your neighbor,
old timer!” echoes Notre; Dame.
Of course the Indiana Irish em-
phasize football more than the
Violet. Their games are written
up in better style. s
What’s this? The New York pa-
per is writing an entire column
about what Notre Dame did to the
Army team “in Brooklyn! Then we
must award the palm of chivalry to
the East.—The Viatorian.

What They Say
Two College Dailies
The week’s- mail brought us ten
copies of the NOTRE DAME
DAILY and almost as many of the
New York University Daily News.
Of course comparisons are 'odious,
but one can’t help doing it, when
you run across two school dailies,
published eight hundred miles
apart, each of four pages, tabloid
size, with the editorials in exactly
corresponding columns, the rahtings
of the colyumists properly - beside
them, the letters to the editors
similarly located - in both, - and a
dozemdikenessesr ™2	™
The .New York paper is an adult,t
the South Bend product an infant
in swaddling clothes. Yet each
. breaths the. spirit of -its section of
. America: the Daily News is’conserv-
ative, metropolitan in aim; the
N. , D.. DAILY, intimate,^ conversa-
tional, mid-western. We like the

Prom Committee
Plans Coffee Dance
This year’s Junior Prom will di-
gress considerably from the old
cut-and-dried ‘program of former
years. One of the outstanding
changes will be the method of re-
ceiving. In place of the usual re-
ception, the committee plans a
morning coffee dance to be held
from 11 till 1 in a downtown, hotel.
The advantages of this are evident.
• Other committees are corres-
ponding with the leaders in music,
decorations and entertainment and
assure that every-thing will be the
best.
Tickets for the juniors will be
put on sale shortly after the holi-
days and a limited time will be
given in which to procure them.

NOTRE DAME DAILY
—Tuesday, December I; 192S.
SOPHS MEET BADIN
THIS AFTERNOON


Winner Will Play Brownson Sunday;
Teams Are Equally Matched;
May Be Postponed.
■' The semi-final game in the Inter-
hall series will be played off this
afternoon at 3' o’clock on Cartier
field between Badin and Sophomore
halls. The winner of the encoun-
ter will be pitted against the Brown-
son hall aggregation in .the title
game next; Sunday.
To date, the Interhall season has
enjoyed no small amount of suc-
cess, considering the condition un-
der which the schedule must be
played off. There is a slight pos-
sibility that today’s game may be
postponed till next Saturday due to
the presence of several, unfavorable
circumstances, the principle one of
which is the matter of class cuts,
since the game will be played in the
middle of the afternoon.
.; Badin hall has been represented
in the Interhall league this fall with
a powerful team, that has given all
•: opponents both of the campus and
on traveling games plenty of stiff
opposition, and their record now
stands 'with three wins and no
- games lost in the hall league.
Badin engaged in two games with
‘ teams on foreign fields during the
Season,’ and. defeated Portland, 13
to 0, in a fast encounter. Badin
held the Wayne Tanks of Fort
Wayne almost to a scoreless tie,
until Les Logan, basket ball mono-
gram man -from Notre Dame booted
a field goal near the end of, the
game, and let the. Irish visitors
down with a 3-to-0 defeat. . ’
! Captain “Butch” Haecker’s Badin
hall team, averaging 160 • pounds,
and winner of the Interhall title
last year, will have the edge on the
Sophomore hall aggregation in to-
morrow’s game. With :Casey, at
quarter and .Cody and Callahan
performing in the backfield, the
team from the west campus will be
able to put an extremely-fast club
in the field. ..Their backfield is
guarded' by a heavy - and well - bal-
anced line, with'McQuern at’cen-
ter, Sommers at' tackle, and New-
man on the flank. The Badinites
present a versatile attack of decep-
tive passes and knifing drives off
tackle and through the center' of
. the line. Both Cody and Callahan
' are fast men on skirting the wings,
and completely dazzled the Port-
land outfit with their speed.
I The Sophomore hall aggregation
' will have the services of more, var-
sity reserves : than will Badin, but
several of their men are handi-
capped. with injuries. -Both teams
are of an equaL weight, and with af
regular lineup in the field, today’s
contest will develop into a most
bitter struggle,. with .‘the interhall
crown at stake. >
Popularity, is often a mere syno-
nym for passivity.,’

BILLIARD TOURNEY
OPENS TONIGHT
Pool and Billiard Champions to
Receive Prizes; Tournament
Open to All Students.
The annual Interhall pool and
billiard tournament will open this
evening in Brownson and Carroll
“rec” rooms. The opening rounds
will begin at 7 o’clock.
Elaborate arrangements have
been completed in an effort to make
this year’s tourney the best in the
history of the. University. Prepa-
rations are being made to accom-
modate the large field of entrants
that will fight out the championship
of the campus in the two events.
Play will be held at the same time
in the two “rec” rooms to facilitate
the handling of the tourney and to
avoid any possible delay.
. The committee in charge of the
tournament announced last night
that the winners of the events would
be awarded handsome, engraved
silver loving cups. Gold coins will
be awarded 1 the men finishing in
second place. These trophies will
be placed on display in ’ the win-
dows of “Hullie and Mike’s” within
the next few days. ,
The , tournament is open to all
students of the University. The
contestants are given an equal op-
portunity to win the championship.
The entrants will, draw for their
opponents and the time and place
of the games, thereby eliminating
any unfairness. Those who intend
to enter the contest are requested
to see James. Egan, Badin; Joseph
Mulhern and O’Hara, Brownson, or
Paul Sagsetter, Carroll.

Notre Dame’s two invasions of
the East this year, in which we met
and defeated Army and Princeton,
exemplified the value of the open
style of play. Its smoothness of
execution was a treat to the 65,000
persons that attended both games.
Scribes and scouts from eastern
football camps also enjoyed, the
exhibitions.
Then came the Yale-Army game,
and the cadets outplayed the Eli
warriors for two quarters. • Yale
was playing old-fashioned football
with a closed formation. In the
second half, adopted the open style
and defeated the Army. Yale tried
the open play 20 years ago and en-
joyed no little success, but grad-
ually reverted to the close forma-
tion. - Cornell, West Virginia, and
Syracuse have also adopted the open
style. Speed displaces brawn. •
