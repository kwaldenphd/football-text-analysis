Kennedy Breaks Course Record in
First Cross Country Meet; /
Time 18:15. /.
Breaking a long standing record
for. the local cross-country course,
Notre. Dame harriers led by Paul
Kennedy, captain of the Trish track
team for the season of 1924, scored
a victory over the Wabash squad
by the .count of 35 to .20 yesterday
morning?.
?. The /three and one-half mile
course was covered in the exception-
ally fast time of 18:15, with the
Irish placing first,. third, fourth,
fifth and sixth. ; ....-;■
.The first quarter was easy with
the t men, well, bunched. . Johnson
and Robbins, star performers on the
down staters squad, held back, till
near the mile mark, reserving.- their
strength for the’finish.; Wendland
took the lead for,the first two miles,
closely, followed by /Paul Kennedy.
At the mile and one-half, Joe Shee-
han, promising varsity ’miler,.‘'tore
a -tendon in his ankle and ' only
through a supreme effort remained
in the .race, for another half'mile,
when he: was forced' to drop out.1
Robbins made a good start but
lacked ;the finishing power/ Shortly
after the two-mile post was passed,
Johnson, drew-up; on the Irish lead-?
ers ' and. challenged. them for .the
lead. The .Wabash' star pushed the
Irish; steppers hard for the next
three-quarters of; a mile. At the
three-mile, mark; .Johnson passed
Wendlandfor Second ;'place 'and
raced after Kennedy in a desperate
attempt to overtake the leader. * -e i
On the last hiH, Kennedy let: out
all. his. reserve! pidwer ■ and left the
down state contender’behind by 90
yards and crossed the1 finish line bn
Cartier field in 18:15, a new record
for the course...............
. The, order 'of the finish was as fol-
lows: Kennedy, N. D?;; Johnson,

ROCKMEN CONQUER
- GEORGIA TECH,«35-7
Miller arid Stuhldreher Star for Rock-
men as Irish Solve Puzzle Shift;
Layden Outpurits Albright by 30yds.
By THOMAS COMAN.
Rockne’s Fighting Team? playing true to its reputation;-defeated the
Golden-Tornado from Georgia Tech, 35 to 7,' on Cartier field yesterday
afternoon before a crowd of. 20,000 people, thus; scoring their third inter-
sectional , triumph- of' the year in one.of the most bitterly; fought: games
ever staged qn; the-local gridiron. . v .■	/	-
The ; southern,.flower, .under the tutelage ,of Coach: Alexander,, and
heralded, as' the • greatest fighting machine in,the. southern, conference,
displayed a brand; of , football yesterday that was as unique, and colorful
as it was,terrific.in its great driving power. ^Opening'.with a line.smash-
ing. attack in the first quarter, the-Georgians never let up on the fierce
"driving, slashing, game that .was. brilliant for, its/ manner of>execution,
but which lacked the .final drive and scoring qualities that were: necessary
to overcome the ;masterful strategy of Knute Rockne, the peer of Ameri-
can, coaches.	:... ..
,. The- .Tech gridders, possessing a whirlwind attack, that resolved it-
self from a-peculiar.line shift, demonstrated the.fact that*?they were; able -
to gain on their terrific line charges'
and make their, first downs? but? fac-
irig the incoinpafable defense of the
Rockmen,’ Albright, / ther: star per-
forriier bf the Yellow Jackets’ teain,
was forced to ’punt" on' every -at-
tempted1 march down the field. The
Irish finding that they were unable
to make.;- any. long, gains Jon
quarter? and rah ten yards for a
touchdown./ The fatality. r of this
method’; of punting soon ’led the
Tech griders to .send their ;punter
back farther; from which position
Albright got off some pretty kicks.

and reeled off long trips of

position. '; His ■ sweeping end runs
were the-downfall of the-Tech-, col-

THE PO5ZT/WS7S
This editorial is aimed at many of us—and in that group the
editor includes himself. Perhaps the sword is particularly sharpened
-to prick the skin of upperclassmen—because, brandishing the sword
withi such care-free grace in the direction of others/it is not unjust that
we at this time try its edge upon bur own leathern hides. '
/We recently stepped into a room where several forms were
sprawled.; Fragmentary remarks in the conversation we remember:
“Palmer Stadium will hold 75,000.” “Pikes Peak is the'highest moun-
tain in the United States.” “This year’s is (a. great Freshman class.”
“This year’s is'a rotten Freshman class.” Now it is quite .'probable
( that none of these remarks was correct. Their perpetrators
were, in fact, 'challenged. The gentleman, who knew so well the ca-
pacity‘of -Palmer Stadium was brought to the admission that his idea
was , merely an “impression.” The one who with /such.'ease elevated
/Pikes Peak a few .hundred feet without so much as Haying placed his
.magical hand on its soil, murmured,.“I think I remember something like
that.in an old geography.” The gentleman who thought our, freshmen
and spoiled apples were akin was .one of the many who thinks every
. Freshman class is the worst. The man with the contrary view has sev-
eral bosom friends .in the: class, of ?27.
We repeat, it is quite, probable that riorte of these gentlemen con-
fined himself wholly to the truth. ■ * t
Too many of us are addicted; to positivism, particularly after we
have had a year; or two'of experience with Notre D ame and its streams
of knowledge! ' Having waded, in ithe waters on infrequent. occasions,
. we become obsessed, by the /very pleasing -idea :tfiat we are tried and/an~
cient ferrymen, sure ■ of ourselves iand sure.of' the stream’s currents;
while as a matter of fact, few of us will ever set foot on the opposite
bank.;	- !
When a freshman,: or other person who admits his knowledge is
limited, asks a.question, we are prompt and firm in giving the-answer—■
not perhaps; the true answer, or the complete answer, but our answer.
Bedt a-question of the football team, we can settle any difficulty from
the time' Michigan taught us the game down to the hypothetical team
of 1930. We cannot be wrong on ithe correct usage, of a word. What
comes to our ears as; rumor leaves! our mouths as fact. So we go on,
doing our humble bit to propagate falsity instead of truth,-to propagate
the'doubt that.hangs on ill-founded statements instead of the clearness
‘that follows frank.admission/ 4 j'	'
/' . , Before we throw a statement«upon the campus winds, we should
be sure of our grounds. / Why forget that there is such a thing as a con-
ditional conjunction?-After all, when you are summoned, before the
Supreme- Judge, and He asks you,’ “Were you at all times faithful to
.Me and to men?” it will probably.go best with you if you answer, “Not
always, Lord, but I tried to be,” rather, than, “Now I’ll tell you, Lord;—•
-J sure was!’/ .	'/. t '

THE CHANGING TIMES
The passing of “Hullie and Mike” and the deserted condition of
campus recreation rooms seems to indicate a change in the Notre Dame
men of today; The “lifer” zin these parts which border on the twin
lakes can remember a time when it; was necessary to form a line to take
care of the men, waiting their turns for a cue and a table. ‘
The adoption of the cut system has contributed in some degree to
the unpopularity of the clicking balls. ' Men who formerly were-, not
averse to spending an hour, which ishouhFhave been spent before!a lab
table,; around, a pool -table, have been convinced bf the reality of this
• ' academic existence. Probably the greatest contributing;cause, however;
is theTessening of the rigorous rules which once held the student on the
campus. The men of today have . more, acquaintances, in -South Bend
k and greater, opportunity to engage in pursuits: more.?enjoyable and
profitable than, pool. It is not so long since the idea prevailed upon
the campus, that a perfect Saturday night consisted in a thrilling:game
of billiards or Five Hundred.	;• ’ ;	. ' 7	. ‘
The increase in the. numb er of student athletes may also be: affect-
ing the popularity of the indoor games. Then, too, the campus is well
organized this year with a greater number, of men engaging in activities
and finding less time for idle recreation/ More nien are swinging a pen
who formerly’pointed a"cue; greater numbers are! clicking camera shut-
. ters who .once clicked billiard balls; more men are tossing the;'football
about these autumn afternoons or blowing wind into a band instrument]
.who. once walked about -a, pool table and blew: cigarette > smoke at the
■ cue-ball, p	•</!	•’/.//!■:
. • Billiards and .pool cannot be; said to be even mildly dissipating;
but if Notre Dame students seem to prefer gamboling on other greens;
- it inusLbe considered; a good'indication bf the better times ahead. ' -

❖"
Last Tuesday we gave some of
the reasons why “Enemies of Wo-
men” is a success, and now, because
this space has to be filled, and be-
cause there is no other material,
we shall give some of the reasons
■ why it could be found fault with in,
let us'say, Spain or France.
Blasco Ibanez does not enjoy
. nearly so much popularity in his
own bailiwick as he does in Amer-
ica, and there are any number of
Spanish novelists. Whose work.is
infinitely better .and. whose .works
are" more, widely read. ' There is,
for example,1 Ricardo1 Leon, whose
“A Son of the Hidalgos” can smile
’ defiance at the most ambitious pro-;
■ject. which Ibanez ever undertook.'
As a propagandist, Ibanez is far,
„ above the average, but so far as lit-
erature is concerned, he leaves much
to be desired.	./
A peculiar feature of the play is
that one of, the most dramatic
scenes is utterly impossible.. You
remember the scene in which Lu-
bimoff fights a duel with Gaston de
Lille, and then, stands motionless
gazing down the barrel of his pistol
when he realizes what he has done.
. De Lille’s superior officer is present,
and Ibanez apparently forgets that
this officer, according to all the tra-
ditions of the French army, would
be liable to court martial and death
for allowing such an encounter to
take’place.' Just how such a scene
would be regarded in France, and
how the delineation of the charac-
ters.of the Duke arid. Duchesse de
' Lille would be accepted, it is fairly
difficult to say.
