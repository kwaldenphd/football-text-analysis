The attractiveness of the book
was pointed out yesterday by Walsh,
, who said that a theme, The Greater
Notre ‘ Dame, had been carried
through the book insofar aspos-
sible. The book differs an almost
every-possible way from the usual
annual, its editors endeavoring to
break. precedent wherever it was
< felt that innovation would make
pleasing novelty.. The book will
contain, five three-color plates, and
will be the first book that has con-
; tained - three-color plates for ’ some

MAY DISCOVER
VALUABLE DATA
Searches Near Portage Expect-
ed to be of Importance
to Notre Dame
The news of the discovery of val-
uable plates in the lake, region,
plates that seem to antedate any
previously discovered even. in other
countries, and which are being ex-
amined by ' University authorities,
has lead to further information as
regards. searches for historical
plates.. '
Along the banks of the’ St. Joseph
River, not far from the monuments
raised to honor: Father Allouez, and
near the historic Fort St. Joseph,
University men are- now busy dig-
ging , for what historical evidence
they can find. While- any. discov-
eries that may.be iriade in this sec-
tion .will_b_eLinno„wise _ comparable,
to the discoveries in the lake region,
the possible discoveries along the St.
Joseph will have much .historical
value as regards the establishment
of data on the early story of this
region, .and on the early story Of
the University. The present work
is in. the region of Portage, already
established as a very important post
in early American history.
Motor power is now being em-
ployed about; Portage, ’ and much
ground has already been turned up.
It is, planned to\rush the work so
that there shall be little digging
during the sweltering days of late
June and early July. . '	■

OVER PURDUE U.
Captain Castner Pitches
Crippled Irish to Victory;
. Michigan Today
By JOHN SHOWEL	.
The Notre Dame basebailers, led
by Captain Paul Castner, defeated
Purdue, 6-0, in a slow game yester-
day at Cartier field. The big south-
paw allowed the Boilermakers but
six hits and was the master of the
game at all times. The Irish cap-
tain batted a two base hit, made
three assists and a put out and
played heady baseball on the bases.
The Notre Dame' lineup was con-
siderably changed on account of
injuries, but the Irish played good
ball /in. the field ‘and. hit. in the
pinches. Campbell, the Purdue
hurler, pitched good ball and'al-
lowed but seven hits, but the loose
field play of the Boilermakers en-
abled-the ...Irish ■ to-^crqss—the—plate-
three times in the second inriing. —’
.. Sheeh’an is still put of. the game
arid .Kane played ' his position at
shortstop. George Vergara played
a splendid game at third. He' han-
dled'all his chances without an er-
ror and made six assists'. Collins
played in the left garden in Berg-
man’s place.. Foley’s hand has im-
proved and he played his usual stel-
lar game about the keystone sack,
and led the Irish batters with two
bingles and a. sacrifice in four trips
to the. plate. .	.	•

TE SALUTAMUS
The gods were merciful to the dead. Those ivory idols for which
- our armies, bled so madly did riot, for them, turn to green sphinxes,
because of the hates, the lusts, the liyid fears, the manifold evils of a
. warring mob. Their blood and the smoke of their, war7 was frankin-
cense and myrrh before their idols,’ their ideals,- and they were never
' to know the ghastly cliimera that would result from the war in which
■- - . they engaged. The dead were spared such after-sights.,
■We need not mourn the millions of slain whose beautiful memory
.. we celebrate todays. They rest in peace. The heritage of cynicism
' and disillusion bequeathed to us as an aftermath of the cunningness-
:	. of war and the release from, its slavery, does not trouble their ranks.'
They did in the splendid fervor of’ an ideal. And the excruciating
realization that we all ;were dupes and will continue to be dupes as
. long as - there is war, and'there are shrewd'diplomats, that we were
. .; . . multitudinous marionettes in the game of a Satanic diplomacy, will
. never disturb_their immortal sleep. They go to join,the,.legions of all
- \ --- --thfiniartyrsy mfirtyrcd' to -greed_and 'a'vaTice."~'	?
Yet, our cause has not been dishonored, nor our aspirations dis-
graced because of the perverted ambitions of some men. The heroism of
;	: . our soldiers has consecrated and elevated it beyond the blasting touch
•.	- ■ of intrigue, cupidity and unrestrained freedom. When the evils, of the
. - .' - , day -have worked their inevitable misery, the refreshing memory of
the:,dead: will inspirit the world. In. time we must realize that the
. > blood of our ’troops . has ennobled the war, that the pathos of their
‘	.7 misspent valor will eventually hallow the cause that now stands-uriveiled
as all but beautiful.
THE BAND
. - . Notre Dame had a band during the early part of the year. They
.- had. the largest band that ever represented the University. Trouble
; came, which from the vantage point of time and position, seems to have.
. . / been, the result of mistakes by both parties. '
But this is' past.
, The band is again organized. Reorganization’ was a desperate
' :<	task, but such men as Jimmie Egan,'who will never give up once they
; ,	. set before them an ideal/-have succeeded in gathering together a new
■' band. ’ A new genesis is come to the band. Professor Parreant, Egan
and others, are Building again, .and they are building with effort-and
. . with a sincerity that will make the new band an even better band than
; the one that was [wrecked by a misunderstanding.
-3	- Although a few courageous men,may keep the life in an organiza-
: • tion that has been near death, they; alone, cannot make it thrive. They
. must be aided by men who.can play, the men who sit in their rooms and
• blow upon musical instruments. while neighbors try to study. A num-
r . ber of men rire behind Professor Parreant and Jimmie Egan. These
:' . men deserve commendation.. The men who are not behind them deserve’
। condemnation.- As allurements to them and to. the other men who-help
. •/	to give life to the band are the splendid uniforms that-are certain for
. - .	next year, the trips that an understanding University can secure for
, , them, and the-support that a willing body of students can give them.

RATHER .BITING COMMENT
(Daily Illini)
Teeth are decaying more fre-
u ■ . ;quently than they did 3,000 or 4;000
.	years ago, t as1 shown by the exam-
j >	ination of a number of Egyptian
. .mummies by a Philadelphia dentist,
who spoke before the Illinois Den-
’tal Society convention recently..-
Just exactly what is the meaning
of this decline, in the condition of
the teeth, of human beings? Four
/. thousand years should be enough to
revolutionize . the . world in teeth.
Perhaps the Egyptians.:had’, real
■. camel’s .hair tooth brushes: and ex-
; . hausted the supply; at least.we can
. . afford camel’s: hair only in paint
brushes nowadays,’ . '
Perhaps .the- Egyptians - brushed
their’teeth six. times a day. instead
of'the' conventional once a day of.
modern practice.
< .The .only good'thing we can make
out of--the situation is that the de-
terioration is a. point in 'favor of
evolution. By the theory of change
according to function, we can con-
clude that the coarse teeth of a peo-
ple who lived in a generation of
more vigorous'struggle'with the ele-
ments have given, way to the “gen-
uine” pearly ones of the modern

being more delicate, are more cap-
able of decay.

FROM OFF STAGE
Whether or not you will like “The
Man From Hell’s River” will depend
largely upon whether or not you
like the brand of pictures for which
the prolific James Oliver Curwood
is responsible. It is a Curwood story
.running'true to form concerning the
usual girl who.is supposed to be the
daughter of an Indian squaw and
who is, to all intent and purposes,
until, the .secret .of her birth is re-
vealed. ...	.... ’■ ?. ,
In. “The Man From Hell’s River”,
Irving Cummings, whom you will’re-
member . as having played • the vil-
; Iain’s role in many pictures in years
past,—assumes...the hero’s.part and
that of director as well, .and it must
: be confessed he does it rather well.
Jane Novak, as Maballa, was vacu-
ous, but her place in the fable de-
manded nothing more. • \	-
There is'nothing distinctive about
this movie; it is just an average
“red blooded he-man” story which
ends in" the prescribed fashion. Its
best feature is that it adds to the
already plentiful laurels of Wallace
Beery, ?.a character actor who? de-
serves even more notice than he has
been receiving.	•	-

And after all, your , point is' what,
professor? ■
The Editor, ■	.	.
Dear Sir:, '
■, I am aware that I. am probably
making, a precedent in writing to
your paper, as it does not yet boast
a correspondence /column. But I
shall -be very brief. -
. .. On looking over , your issue of
Sunday, I was very surprised to
see* your flamboyant headlines, and
surprise ; turned; to perturbation
when I read the ■ column which, to
use. the. phraseology of your. re-
pprterj “out-tutted King Tut.” I
amconsequently,' penning ■ these
lines, not so much to re,veal my own
position, but to vindicate the good
names of King, Tut . and Lord Car-
narvon, j. I. knew : neither of< these
gentlemen,..but:I believe they have
. done, nothing.to; deserve this. They
'seem to have enough to bear.
When I -read your-story, I was
reminded of the irascible bld Eng-
lishman who ; always’. interrupted
with ;■ “Tut ! .Tut!’.’ Well,? Mr. Ed-
■ itorj;this- is rny-:“Tut! Tut!”. but it
is ’• well-meant rather than irasci-
ble. ' In other words, I regret, but
forgive the impetuous enthusiasm
of your reporter, and his ^“terrific”
(there is no. otheriword), write-up.
-As for the story itself,' there is
some truth, in it. ' There are such
things, in ' the district mentioned,
Father Gregory Gerrer has > such, a
collection which does bear strong
Egyptian, resemblances,, and Fathers
Walsh, Gregory and myself ■ have
spoken..of the advisabilityof going
to the burial grounds; But apart
from this, nothing. ; •	■

Announcement has been made by
the committee in charge that the
fourth academic annual ' will be
ready for distribution June 1. The
1923 annual is to.’exceed those of
other /years, several new, sections
having been added. A new style
cover, more elaborate in design than
the old one has . also been adopted.
.On Monday afternoon from two
to eight the fourth academics were
the guests of: the thirds at a steak
fry given in Paradise Glen.. Min, a
chivalrous, war steed, \ under the
guidance of the thirds, conveyed
the. supplies to the festive grounds.
The lunch consisted, of juicy steak,
weenies, hot rolls, coffee with real
cream, strawberries, popcorn, ice
cream and cake; All dignity was
put aside and .the time was spent in
romping around and playing games.
The favors were delicious lollypops.

AGAIN NEXT YEAR .
The faculty of Wisconsin Uni-
versity has already appointed the
next; year’s Homecoming commit-
tees, planning to make it the big-
gest and most exciting the students
and old grads have ever witnessed.
This recalls to mind our last Home-
coming—the barbecue, the torch-
light snake-dance to welcome the
Crimson eleven, the frenzied yells
of the over-enthusiastic students,
the .agile Boosters, the pretty maid-
ens from Chicago, Indianapolis,
Cleveland, Toledo and Fort Wayne,
the 27-0 game, the spectacular Cast-
ner in his- last fray on Cartier
field, the real Notre Dame spirit.

JIM IS ON THE RIGHT PATH°
We were telling Jimmy Swift
that from the figures compiled at
Ohio State University we learned
that a college co-ed’s training, along
the social lines alone,. costs' the
university more than her board and
room; together costs hei\ family.
Jim did not seem, to doubt that, but
what he wanted to know, was why
the statistician stopped at that. “If
dates and parties all constitute, a
social training/’ he said, “why
didn’t they find out how much, it
costs the eds/’	- '
