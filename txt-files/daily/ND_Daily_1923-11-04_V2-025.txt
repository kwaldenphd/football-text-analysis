Irish Harriers Win Second Victory
in M. A, 0. Meet; Conlin Turns
Ankle; 'Wendland Second, •:
Breaking his own course, record,
established at the Wabash meet last
Saturday, Paul Kennedy, captain of
the Irish track team, led the field in
yesterday’s cross-country meet with
the Michigan Aggies, which’ Notre
Dame won, 25 to 30. Kennedy
crossed the finish line in 18:08,
which was faster than the time in
the . Wabash .meet by, seven .seconds.
’ The Irish harriers; scored first,
second, fourth, eighth and tenth,
with-. Wendland of Notre Dame
beating Bagley of the' Aggies out
of second place. ■- -	.	' ;
Starting the three and a half mile
run at ,11 o’clock, both team's were
well bunched for the first half mile,
with' Andy Conlin setting the pace.
Kennedy and Bagley forged ahead,
neither one attempting to let out
any .speed to gain the lead. Wend-
land took the pace at the three-quar-
ters when Conlin turned his ankle
and dropped out of the race.
At the two-mile post, Bagley
pulled up, and challenged {the Irish
•leaders for > the; pace. Kennedy
pulled, away with the finish only
three-quarters of a mile away, and
Bagley sped after him in a vain at-
tempt to overtake the Irish captain.
Within sight of the finish line,
Wendland passed the -Aggie con-
tender for second, place, while Cox
drew up on the heels of the M. A. C.
runner. ;	.
i The order of the finish for Notre
Dame was Kennedy, 'Wendland, Cox,
Bidwell and Cooper.

' Although the-iupremacy of . the। Rockmen’s football reputation was
never in danger of being blotted out by defeat, the Purdue team was a
dangerous bunch, constantly alert to take advantage of every break.
^With the fighting qualities they displayed yesterday, against a.team that
had the- edge,on them in every department, they can take their? place
among the. foremost of the scrappiest team* in the country. • ■ • -,. J . / .
’ ’T Seventeen years ago .today, Purdue and Notre Dame .met on the
football field in a great game which “
Notre Dame won, 2, to 0. This was
th6” beginning, of the Jong string 'of
Irish'’victories* that !haveTed up'to
the1 Homecoming 'triumph yesterday
afternoon.	= r.;	' < r -
- i; At! times both Yearns played loose'
football and the Irish contingent
did’ not. seem -to ;play- the same' brand
of ball that marked their sensational
victories,of। the past.three,.weeks., •,*
Yesterday’s game proved to be
good indication of Purdue’s, ability
to.^take ‘ a' rise '.in, conference foot-

.ball ranks1 and the’ team that Jimmy
!Plielari •pitted’, against the - Irish in

its' presence felt in the’ .Big Ten

composed .’almost' entirely of ..sopho-
niores and' juniors.- ' *7, ' .	.
; 'The\much;heralded ‘ Purdue line
that .made.''such’ a brilliant';showing
aginst’ the ’Maroons,1 failed1 to stem
the’ terrific Irish .drives’ in the open-
ing 1 quarter, of the ’ game, until the
first tally ;had been hung up on the
Rockmen’s side of the score board.
Captain-Brown’s cohorts began? their
second march./ toward j the, ’; Boiler-
•(makers’ goal arid the, opposition’s
line stiffened and' checked the
smashes of the Irish backs through
center and off tackle.
j /.Notre Dame had the best of the
first quarter, with “Dutch” Berg-
man and Maher picking up huge
gobs of yardage while Cerney
cracked the center for gains of six
and eight yards. The steady march
was enlivened in Purdue’s territory
when Bergman passed to Maher for
30 yards, who made a. shifty run on
the next play for the nine yards and
ttiie first counter. 4..r,	...
j LThe Boilermakers’' line smashing
crew started some- action- after the
Idck-off arid, punctured; the Irish
:line for first down.' 1/Phelan’s; meh"
completed the first pass attempted
•for a gain of 16 yards.	h .
:' ZThe Purdue offensive attack in
■this period was met with-a-stout de-
jfehse from the Rockmen, wheri. Col-
lins at the left flank for the Rock-
;men, broke through and dropped
■Hetrick for a loss. Purdue’s /two
ipasses in this quarter were sudden
.'and executed for substantial gains.
Z ./Carlson,- Phelan’s’ 'brilliant,/full?
iback, was cracking the line'with t'er-
¥ific force and like Layden was able
■to!| crawl a few, more feet after the
tackler hadhit ’him.’
7 /Cerney m	.pretty run through
the ’entire1 Purdue'team for 60 yards,
but the ball was called back, by the
referee. 1	'	‘	..	.	. t
■ When the teams changed' sides
for the second peno;d,- Rockne sent
in his first string, gridders who put
the .damper on the Engineers’drive,
while the Irish backs, Layden, Mil-
ler. and Crowley ran circles’around
the Boilermakers’ defense. Ini four .
plays,. Layden. and? Miller; counted
for a 4i-yafd gain with the.aid of
the famous Irish interference and
brought the ball, within the- shadow -
of Purdue’s goal posts.
' With the ball on Purdue’s 14-
yard line, Crowley, the Green Bay
flash,-reeled off ten yards through
tackle. Layden carring the oval on
the . next play, . almost ’ dupli-
cated the .Iowa instance’ when 'lie
fumbled on the four-yard line, but .
recovered the' ball and Miller hung
up; the: second tally on a pretty
charge through tackle. : .	;	<
Crowe, .who. went in at the left
■vying for! Notre Dame, played a-bril-
liant. game .on the offense-and-Pur-
flue found that it was almost impos-:
,sible to send the play around that!
wing.- -His vicious. tackling and
;bloeking was an? exhibition of that
!fqotball. instinct that. makes . great
players and drew the praise of the ’
flrowd. on several occasions.. ., ,
: 1 The 'entire\ second period ‘was riot
Kvith ..action and .Purdue’ acconi--
plished’ what’ the Army and Prince- ’
ton failed to do. Gladders came in-
to the game and reeled off a pretty?
run for 33 yards that put the Boil-!
ermakers in midfield. Prout car-
rying the . pigskin oh the next play,
uncorked one of the most spectacu-?
•lar: runs of the game when he zig-
zagged his way through the entire
Irish team.for Purdue’s only conn-:
ter of the struggle.	’ M
. The score addled zest bo • the.<
•game; the crowd was on edge wait^
ing for the next move of the Rock- ’
men and- they were not , disap/.:
pointed. Purdue kicked off and!
shortly after, Don Miller, the great-?s
est' running back > in the country;:
.stepped away., around the. Boiler-; j
makers’, end 'for 27 yards, and was ? •
dropped only after < a hard .tackle

Irish fumbled again and Purdue re-
covered.	....... /
The third period was featuredJ /
.with,a passing attack on the part of i
.both ' teams? - - Carlson passed to1; '-
Jacobs for T 5 yards /and followed! ,
with;"another for the . three yards.! ’
The Irish took the! ball o'n the punt! ' •
and rushed it into, the Boilermak./!.,,
ers’ territory. /	1	! !
.Purdue tried some fake kick for-j j .
mations which : turned into wide HI ,
end runs, but the . Irish ends-were
coming too fast for Phelan’s backs/
to get away, and May! threw Sprad-;
ling for a five-yard loss. Still un-/'

’ WHOSE FAULT IS IT? : !
J If students, ares (cheating them-
selves out of: what college has to
offer them, as one Emporia profes-
sor, believes, whose fault is it ?	-
Under our present system at the
University, a- student who comes
here seeking only, social life or the
right to say he has’ been away to
college,' is.usually disposed (of after
the first,semester. .J. hk ;
For.: the; majority ,of'!<>students,
“coming; away, to. college” means
coming: away from : home: for the
first time arid entering an entirely
different-kind i of a life from that to
which-they; have/ been accustomed.
Most of them are still in their teens
and feel keenly the.lack of parental
advice and: guidance,: though at. the
same. ;time taking great pleasure in
their own independence, and ability
to stand alone. .
, They are all dumped promiscu-
ously into boarding houses, all forc-
ed to take practically the T same
courses for/,their first, two years,
many of -which they have no in-
terest'in.
-. The* students are striving to get
the;.most out of college;; professors
are striving: to* give, them: the! most.
Those, /facts are /uncontrovertible. ?

professor!to realize some of the dif-
ficulties against which/the! average
student bumps: ■/ during •: his four
years in- college.—Daily Kansan.
