Wilbur Herbert Burnham,
Boston Designer, Presents
Exhibit of Much Interest
;By VINCENT F. FAGAN
; The. work of a .true craftsman,
faithful to the sincerity and artistry
of the medieval workers, is being
exhibited: at Lemmonier Library.
Wilbur Herbert Burnham, of Bos-
ton, a designer and maker of stain-
- ed arid leaded glass, ?has sent a num-
. ber of ? examples of his art to the
; University for exhibition here.? The
.exhibit came, in care of the Isfotre
Dariie Department . of Architecture.
. . Mr. Burnham’s fidelity in riiinute
detail to the principles of the cen-
turies , of Gothic' achievement is
evidenced in his' careful study of
the glass. of that time—a careful
study inspired by a realization that
. his, ■ together with other . architec-
tural arts, has. suffered .through re-
cerit dark ages.of a 19th century
, marked by inferior, accomplishment
and' incentive, 'and meagre knowl-
edge. ■	.	? -	.
•	Europe as Model . ?
■ Mr. Burnham lately . returned
from a European trip-with sketches
and studies of medieval glass and

Plenty of Food, Fun and Dances
for Students on
Oriental Trip
“When the ?Notre Dame ;men who
are taking foreign trips come to
■China,” says George B. Chao, Chi-
nese' student in journalisiri, “there
are many things they should' not
miss.”.-'.. ' ?■ ? • .- ■	;	'
The- little Chinaman, short and
talkative, felt that he should give
the Oriental travelers a few point-
ers before they entered the land of
Confucius. n	.
“Guides, written in -English may
be obtained at Shanghai, and Hong7
kong,” ’ he said. • “Shanghai is sit-
uated on the /Worigpu River,\ is a
modern commercial seaport, and
has a population of 670,000; in-
cluding 6,800 foreigners. Street
cars/ ruri to all parts of the city,
carry you to dancing halls, - good
restaurants, and. to comfortable ho-
tels, The student deck-hands should
not miss the Cathedral'of St.-Jo-
seph at the end of the Zaccawei
Road—” '	.
. The reporter’’took time ’ out ? to.
spell Ziccawei; ; George poked him
in the ? ribs,. smiled and spit out
more .tongue, twisters.
: ' “The Olympic Theater, is on
North Dzechwan Road,” he , said.
“Then there ■ is the Catholic Univer7
sity, the biggest Catholic? institu-
tion in China, established by Chi-
nese and run by Jesuits.. The > Com-
mercial Press is bn Horan Road,
the Chinese Pagoda / at‘ . Longliwa
Village, a few miles, from Shanghai;
the City? God Temple in south
Shanghai, the museum on Museum
Road, Nanyang College on Zicca-
wei Road,' and. St. John’s arid ? St.
Mary’s University bn Jesfield .Road.
.. ‘“Chinese students -at these col-
leges speak good English,” he said,
using very good English/ himself/
very careful ..English, the texLbook
kind.	.	.
“The city of Hongkong is . on a
mountain,” he said? “You'will find
the; beautiful ?houses of inhabitants
along your way toMts top. It is a
beautiful trip tb the top of Hong-
kqrig Island, and. to see Victor Bay,
as you take the electric car up the
mountain path.” ■	:	-
Five Hundred “Victory March”
Discs Signed for But
Unpaid
Following a meeting of the Sen-
ior Ball Committee yesterday after-
noon, in the Journalism room of the
library, • steps were taken for, the
disposal before June 10 , of the re-
maining phonograph records of the
Notre Dame Victory ; March, pub-
lished recently by the senior class.
An appeal was.sent out at the saine
time by the committeemen to ; all
students, asking that students who
signed up for records, ' get . them
and pay up immediately.? .
It was made plain to the mem-
bers of the committee at the meet-
ing, yesterday, by Chairman John
Stephan that Unless the remaining
records are disposed of, ? the class
will find itself with.a considerable
shortage in its funds. According to
Stephan, 500. men who, signed up
for records at the time the orders
were taken, have riot yet taken and
paid. for their orders. These rec-
ords must be sold immediately in
order to liquidate the debts of the
class before Commencement. Day
students,, especially, are requested-
to pay for their records. These
men' are asked to help John Chapla
and . Linus Glotzbach, the. men in
charge ’ of the off-cairipus distribu-
tion by calling at Chapla’s- room,
Sorin subway. ..

Casasanta, Furey, Ryan Pre-
sent Pleasing Program at
Notre Dame......
By NORBERT ENGELS ' ' .
Joseph Casasanta; pianist, - assist-
ed by William Furey, bass, both stu-
dents of the School of Music at No-
tre Dame, won the good will and
applause of the audience throughout
the program presented by them last
night in Washington Hall because
of their excellent playing and sing-
irig. The occasion was- Casasanta’s
bachelor recital;	.	.'
Casasanta is ..a young .piariist, of
rare, ability. He has temperament,
a well developed sense of. the artis-
tic, and sufficient technique to make
his idea of inusic comprehensible.
In the Bach group particularly his
musicianship was in, evidence. His
phrasing and'.interpretation of these
numbers showed a true understand-
ing of the style^ of this, greatest of-
masters’. ’ - : ' ? ’ ■< ?	.
There was much beauty .of tone
and fineness of . feeling in his; play-
ing .of the. Haydn. Sonata, ?the Cho-
pin ? Nocturne, and. Becker’s “Archi-
tectural Impressions.” Mr. Becker
writes in an idiom; all his own, influ-
enced by the idea' of -modernism,
and at times, ultra-modernism. Nev-
ertheless, the development , of his
work is carried out to a logical con-
clusion.. “Architectural Impres-
sions” is original, both harmonically
and polyphonically, particularly the
conclusion, ending as it does on the
A Flat Minor chord with an added
note • absolutely foreign ... to that
chord, instead of the traditional and
hackneyed tonic. ;	, /	. . ...?
? William Furey, \it seemed to me,
was at his best last night. His choice
of songs was most happy.? , He is the
possessor, of? a fine voice and' has
been taught by Professor . George
O’Connell, of. the. School of Music,
how; to use it effectively.-; His
enunciation was - all that could be
desired? / “The. Vistor,”, the words
of? which . were written by ,Mr.
O’Connell,' is a beautiful? song and
was sung in the same pleasing
manner as were all of the number's
done by Furey.	/
’Joseph Ryan, .at? the piano. ?for
Furey,’, played: his accompaniment
in a sympathetic manner, and shows
promise , of developing into a finish-
ed pianist. .	,
George Bischoff, the Secretary;
Tim Rauh, the Treasurer;
Last Meeting
> The Students’, Activities Commit-
tee held.their annual election of offi-
cers for next year at a meeting last
night. James Swift was chosen to • .
succeed John Cavanaugh to-the ’

Even though the Day Students are handicapped by the lack of
dormitory accommodations on. the campus, they have-no excuse for not
taking an active part in the organizations which exist for their benefit.
At the Day Students’. S. A. C; nominations yesterday there were but 40
out.of 700 men present. When they were notified to appear for a group
picture .taken for the ’23 Dome, only; a' handful responded, although
calls were repeated several -times, and their ranks were finally filled
with Indiana Club. men. Some-time ago in the drive for Daily sub-
- scriptions but a smalt percentage responded. In the debates, the ora-
tion and. the elocution contests, the Forum and activities in general they
take little part;: Neither are they properly represented in the varsity
sports or the Interhall frays. ■ What is the.matter?
Good thing the shimmy dance
isn’t in now. Imagine 4,000 moves

YOUR SONG; YOUR SCHOOL
---When the .Star—SpangledBannerisplaycd.-tlic-inan-who-lovcs- his
country rises ,to, his feet. . When the Notre Dame Victory March is
played, the real Notre Daine man rises, enthusiastic for the school
he loves.
Not only does he rise because of the unfathomable love he has for
the school, but he rises because he has a pride in the institution and in
all that represents .its life.- Most representative of its life is the Vic-
tory March, the chorus.of men fighting on to victory, to success. . .
Last fall'Notre Dame men almost unanimously signified a desire
to buy the March on records, that they might have a true means’ of
recalling'the song that has made teams win games and given new life
to failing meh. ' Leading-recording companies were solicited to .make
the record. All; of them, however, refused to take on the work, although
the influences of such prominent persons of Edward N. Hurley, Presi-
dent- Wurzer, of the Alumni Association, Mayor Dever, of Chicago,
■Marie Zendt, opera singer, and the officials of the Remick Publishing
Company, publishers of, sheet music, were brought to bear on the
recorders. For this .reason the committee was forced to employ a more
. recently; formed recording company. During a long afternoon,’Harry
Denny’s orchestra-and the Glee Club Quartet played their parts for
the record. They played, listened to the proofed disc, played again,
and again. It’was new and tedious work.
Recently the records were received. Some were claimed by the sub-
• scribers. Hundreds were not'claimed though men had signed to pur-
chase them. The returns from sales were intended to aid in produc-
. ing the Ball, and now, as the situation stands, the senior class is liable
. to be without enough to liquidate its debts by Commencement time.
. Upon the moral response of the signed and unpaying, hundreds the
financial conditions of the class depends.
The senior class appeals to you. Are you a man of your word?.

ber heels on—”	-

A MAJOR SPORT, DRAMATICS
: . Athletics at Notre Dame always have been well supported by the
-students. When the various seasons arrive for competition in the
major sports, one will find the contestants numerous, and a group of
cheering spectators eager to support their teammates. This is- as it
should be. It indicates that Notre Dame is providing for the physical,
as well as for the- mental, development of the fellows. But at the
same time there is an apparent lack of interest shown by these same
students to participate in other beneficial activities, such as dramatics.
Some students have falsely attributed the blame for’.their lack of
” dramatic enthusiasm to-the • University faculty, saying' that the Uni-
versity is not interested in such activities, and consequently‘. will not
appropriate money .for rehearsal, masters, scenes and costumes.; In
doing this they have overlooked the fact that the University .has pro-
vided a’special, instructor who selects from among, his classes those
best talented for the plays; that new; panoramic drapes were added
to the. Washington Hall properties when the “Taming of the Shrew”
was staged this year; that it was at .the suggestion of the University
;the old Players’ Club merged into the Drama Circle, which is directly
' affiliated with the National .Drama, League.; This merger was advo-
cated because it would enable the Circle members to keep in; close
contact with dramatics outside the University sphere, and would give
the aspiring actors a better chance to display their ability in a larger
organization with a capacity for more plays. Always has the Univer-
sity'been willing to cooperate. _ The future of dramatics at Notre Dame
depends upon the students alone. ' .	.	.
. ’ And neck and head too, maybe.
My dear Kolars:.
In last Sunday’s DAILY you pub-
lished the. first two lines of a verse
with the invitation to “lawyers” to
finish it. • I’ll try. ;
'I want to study up law-books,
To make this planet safe for crooks,
Not only column-scribbling pinks, .
Nor for" the lowly wretch who thinks /
His weak words really- hurt. • •.	‘
I want to "study up” the law-.
My 'logic to erase of flaw. ■
So I can; value rights of others
And ^realize.that we’re all brothers
And'not just insects that will bite.' .
You-are a journalist; it’s true,
An avocation really, new,
Not ‘aged by . venerating years,'
Nor rinsed, like law, in human'tears
.Of mankind’s everlasting woe.
And being such, it must be so ■
That one great truth you surely know;
Slander-never breeds respect
For'him who slanders, so reflect.
Before you strike again!
; All the law students that I kno.w
and heard express themselves were
hurt and angered by your unneces-
sary attack on a profession that
they, hold dear. The bit was small
and not conspicuous it is true, but
every lawyer saw and; resented-it.
■ Sincerely yours, - .

The night was inky black. The
trees were fairly dripping with mys-
tery. The belated Hooda quickened
his steps as he drew hear the grave-,
yard. The distant tower clock struck
1 with a .faint and unearthly sound.
A queer chill crept over Hooda. His
steps became still more: rapid, but
whdn he had passed the last tomb
the . chill crept home again To its
roost in the graveyard.- . The. clock
struck again savagely,' but missed.
And then it'happened: A tail-spec-
ter shape came as if from the
ground at his very feet. - A hollow
death, knell , voice tolled out, “I am
the Headless Hessian.” Frightened
though he was', Hooda remembered
his logic. ', ,	'	: T
“Whereis . your horse?’’ said
Hooda.. ,
.“Gone,” whispered the specter.
“Where. did ‘ you get the head,”
said - Hooda. For truthfully the
thing did have, a head/
- J‘1 traded the horse for it,” hissed-
the specter. :	" f-
v“Whom to?” said Hooda.-
“An ..English"Prof,” whined the
specteE < .	. . ..
-“You got rimmed,” said Hooda,
and passed on. .	_

.THE GREAT UNSHAVED
- (The Daily Kansan)
A‘ glamour of romance : hangs
about the man whose face bears
unmistakable signs of :not having
seen a barber shop for several days.
There/is something so manly about
this person, too. The very length
and apparent stiffness of these pro-
jections on this wonderful he-man’s
face inspires. awe and reverence in
the female breast. •	. -
As. long as the women of the
campus feel the way. they do, why
give. up - fifteen . minutes of. sleep
just - to rise and shave? . No man
with any sense of the ‘fitness of
things would chance a woman’s dis-
approval by so doing. That is, .not
if he were a real honest-to-goodness
man.' Of course a woman doesn’t
come on the hill with her hair un-
combed, her hose wrinkling , sadly
about her ankles, and her ' blouse
and skirt ;not/meeting under her
sweater. But then, it’s different
with a woman., . She ought. to be
presentable always, because a man
likes to .have .her that way—and she
must always, please him. ; But as
long as a man looks just .as wonder-
ful with his face . looking, like a
cross between a nutmeg grater and
a stubble field in the winter—why
shave? :: y:/.
While'.this is..not a plea for the
establishment of a ^Whiskers For-,
ever” . society; it is a word, of de-
fense and commendation for ’those
poor maligned men who have been
accused of being, untidy and

slovenly just because they don’t
have time to shave. Their time, is ■
too* much, taken, up with study or

The Mining Club held its final
meeting of the year in Chemistry
Hall Thursday evening. The fol-
lowing officers were elected for the
neW scholastic year: Eugene Sulli-
van, president; Robert Parnell, vice
president; Leon Sullivan, secretary-
treasurer; Paul Hartman, sergeant-
at-arms. •	‘	.
Brief farewell talks were given
by Karl Paulissen, Randall Dempf,
and Robert Peck. . These men will
receive their degrees next week.
After refreshments were served
the meeting came to a close.

Sports
The Pre-Medics won over the
Miners Thursday afternoon, eight to
four. The game was close until the
sixth inning when the Medics scored
four runs, mostly through errors.
Brown, of the Doctors, gave an ex-
hibition of trick base running, and
the playing of the Pre-Medics’ first
sackerwas worth watching; Gil-
singer’s change, of pace kept the
Miners guessing. Sturgis twirled a
good' game but lost through poor
support in the pinches.

ested in having . this . association
sponsored free scholarship for a
deserving student im the. art of sani-

the dean he asks for information as
to the proper method to be fol-
lowed in this case. Such informa-
tion is to cover, the cost per year

adopt for the. selection of the stu-

, The scholarship will be awarded
probably at their convention, to be
held in Atlantic City, N. J.; from

purpose. Selection will be on the

“Ladies Must Live,” the current
production at the Blackstone, is the
work of George Loane Tucker, who
directed “The Miracle Man” a few
years ago. Than this, little more
can be said, for any adverse criti-
cism of Tucker’s opus is no less
than heresy. .	.
• The story was adapted by Mr.
Tucker from a novel by Alice Duer
Miller. It concerns a problem which
is by no means new, and it treats
it in the light of the peculiarities
of modern society. You may not
care for the way'in which it is han-
dled, but the fact remains that it is
done in workmanlike fashion,' al-
though it has neither the power nor
the; appeal of “The Miracle Man.”
In the cast are- Betty Compson,
Robert Ellis, Hamion Hamilton, and
Leatrice Joy, any one of whom
could make a picture a success.
When they combine forces the re^
suit is altogether satisfactory.

Losses Hardly Discount Cap-
able Work of a Team
in First Season
The Notre Daine -Tennis -Associa-
tion’ has done, wonders in its short
existerice; in putting tennis on its
feet here. Until'it started, tennis
was dead, undeniably dead. But
within a few weeks of its inception,
on May 7, a match was played with
the strorig conference ‘ team of In-
diana on' the home. coruts., The
team was inexperienced and lacked
practice, the two main factors which
contributed to its defeat. Two days
later, on May 9, the .teain went .into
action against Michigan,' and put
up a far stiffer battle ,to, this far
better, team. than they had against
Indiana, but .with no better results,
because .Michigan has a team which
went undefeated last year., :
:The association has been fortun-.
ate in getting the services of C/P.
Van .Ryper as coach. , • Mr. Van
Ryper, who has recently moved to
this vicinity: from Englewood, N, J.,
and who was for a time assistant
track and tennis coach at George-
town University,: kindly offered his
services, gratis, >.to the coaching of
the team> Those who have followed
tennis know what remarkable im-.
provement he brought about in the
men on the squad. ;	' . ;
- Father ; Walsh; and'-,the athletic
coun cil' foun d’iFariip0 ssible~this ;y ear
to pu£: up .• permanent z courts; - but
this summer, work will be completed
on the four outdoor courts.
Probably- the 'best man on ■ the
team this, year was Herm Centlivre.
He fought two close matches with
Indiana: and Michigan; Hayworth
and Rorick; .. playing members: one
and two respectively on their teams,
barely nosing, him out.' Eddie Lutz
started- well, :but in both matches
was decidedly off form.; He was,
like : the . others, .'handicapped- in
playing bn the .outdoor?courts in the
first match, but in both matches his
driving arid overhead were so er-
ratic as to make him easily beatable.
Tony Gonzalez;/ riot - of .Laredo/
Texas, but of the Philippine Islands,:
played good tennis against 'Indiana
but fell downwhen battling, Mich-
igan/ He, has shown .much- ability,•
however, and proihises well for next
year. . Harry McGuire was defeated*,
in his match with Indiana, but par-
tially made up for: it' in the terrific
doubles battle? which ?he and, Cent-
'.livre played against. Merkel and,
Rorick, of Michigan. Mike Zelasco
played , surprisingly consistent teri-
nis in both his matches, doing better
against Michigan; than . Indiana. ■
