' Prof. Reynolds Gives-
Interesting Reading
Before a fair-sized and appre-
ciative audience Professor.Reynolds,
. of the public speaking department,'
gave- a most inter esting rendition
of “A Tailor Made Man” in Wash-
: : ingtori hall last night.. The play
was in fo'ur acts, and Mr. Reynolds
received; much applause following
each act, particularly the first.
/.;■ Most remarkable' and entertain-
ing was the way in which Professor
, , Reynolds displayed his mastery of
^characterization and simulation of
parts. In . interpreting John Paul
Bart and Dr. Sbnpag he was at his
- best. ’ The way in which he. render-
ed the two father difficult dialect
parts/was also'noteworthy.
< The reading was without, doubt
among the best that has been heard
in Washington hall this season, and
the play, itself proved to be a wor-
thy, vehicle for the talents ; of the
reader. It was indeed well-chosen.
Professor Reynolds is a graduate of
, the Leland- Powers school of ex-
pression,, as .is-Professor Sullivan,
head of the department of public
speaking; Mr. Reynolds well display-
ed the technique- and theory of
reading acquired at Leland Powers,
last night in Washington hall. '

INDIANA NINE TO
MEET IRISH TODAY
CRIMSON SQUAD COMPLETES
THREE GAME TRIP ON
CARTIER FIELD.
Marking , th., third and last game
of their northern trip, the Indiana
baseball players will arrive on Car-
tier field, this afternoon to meet the
Notre Dame varsity nine in the first
game of a home and home series at
4 o’clock.
The Keoganites/ although having
copped a special game with. the
Crimson ball tossers, 4 to 1 in In-
dianapolis last week, are looking
forward to anything but an easy
gaihe with the do’wnstaters. The
Irish mentor may possibly change
his line-up to'some extent in order
to further the batting power of the
Blue and Gold squad. Past games
have indicated plenty of hitting
material on the team and a new or-
der—may^- strengtheni The^offepsiye.
power “of'the nine. - v " • " ’ ' W
Lose to Minnesota.
The visitors .opened their north-
ern jaunt with a game at Minneso-
ta' which the Bloomington batsmen
lost, 7 tb 5. ' Reports from the
game indicate the; fact that -.the
Crimson nine had the situation in
hand several times and were in'a
fair way to win had/not the infield
wavered oii a two base hit with the
sacks filled.
' Moomaw, ,Knight, and. Diller are
regarded as the premier sluggers on
the Indiana nine; Moomaw is In-
diana’s great backstop and major
league scouts ^have been watching
him in action. , Diller, is the bam-
bino of the Crimson club and is a
dangerous man at the plate.
Woodward.to Pitch. v-
Les' Mann is carrying a twirler
this year who does not use a curve
ball but who uses a fast ball and a
changing pace with remarkable ef-
fectiveness. - Woodward was exper-
iencing a slight ailment with his
arm when he took the mound in the
Gopher game and was touched for
10 hits, struck out 6 men and sent
4 men to first base with four balls.
With Woodward resting since the
Gopher game in order to have, his
arm in the *best possible shape for
the Notre Dame game, the Irish
will have to be primed-for a swift
offensive' game this afternoon.
Gus. Stange or -Frank McGrath
will draw the pitching assignment
against Indiana and while possible
changes iii the line-up for-today’s
game have not been announced, the
rest over the-1 week end is certain to
have the Irish squad' in fighting
trim.

CONCERNING, THE LAUNDRY CASE
. . Because public interest, has been so constantly centered upon-the
’	soldiers’ bonus, tax reduction and political developments recently, the
.	publicity, now being, vended by an agency devised for that very pur-
pose, in favor of better pay for postal clerks, has not won the attention
which, it deserves. Nearly everyone is indeed in favor of better pay
for the postoffice employees—so long as the increase is paid by someone
else; but such indifferent support is not very likely to be of much value.
- 'Whatever opposition there may be; to the movement, then; may be
said to be contained in difference of opinion as to the best method of
. raising the increased revenue which would be necessary. Thus the
proposition that has been, made to-.make the, newspapers pay much
/TEigher postage' rates resulted infantagonizing theTpressTtb some extent.
The editors regard such a: proposition as practically prohibitive, since.
. it would make'the general circulation of newspapers over a . wide terr-
itory much too costly.' • They, belieye that it would consequently advance
the segregation of knowledge, which is certainly not desirable. /
. In order to enlist the wholehearted support of the press,, there-
fore,'the friends of the higher postal pay movement will have to evolve
some plan of' providing for the additional revenue. Perhaps the solu/
tion lies in the possibility of increasing parcel post rates. Thus the
contents, of the postal clerk’s pay envelope may be of direct concern
io each student who sends or receives a parcel. But those1 sending or
‘ receiving these boxes would hardly begrudge the few additional cents
of postage if they could aid in maintaing a happier and more efficient
postoffice personnel; If increased parcel post rates can bring p.bout
justice in wage paying and increase the effiiciency in a service in which
we are all interested, by alt means let us accept them cheerfully. :
AUTOS OR A HOME '
■ A survey, in Monroe, county, Indiana, shows, that the value of autos
in the county averaged $230, while the value of household furniture
. averaged-only $130 to each home. ■'	■	/	/	-	.
■	. This should be a most interesting bit of news to many. The trend
of the timc«3 is clearly toward an auto rather than a home. Take/ for
example, the. people in your home town and consider'the number of
. them who have machines and yet do not own a home. , Andt of those
- who do own homes, are not many of them owners of automobiles Which
. they secured by mortgaging the home ?	.	. .	,
. It is riot a very good iridication when the auto takes precedence
over the, home. That condition of affairs is undoubtedly the cause of much
1 unrest of the present day. - It may even, extend to the cause for so much
divorcee/ The family cannot be kept together unless there is a .home;.
And a home is quite different from a house, or a flat, or'am apartment.
/ It is what is inside the house, or,the flat, or the/apartment. ■ '
THE COMING ELECTIONS
>	■ Within the next two weeks, the Junior, Sophomore, and Freshman
• classes will choose officers' and S. A. C. representatives ’for 1924-25;
. ; .No doubt the usual political machines will appear as is''the custom at
: Notre Dame but it is to be hoped that care and conscientious endeavor
- to elect wisely^will govern the voters in the various classes.
. ' ; The men. who have administered class affairs and served, as mem-
jbers of the S. A. C., in the; past have established a-precedent by the
capable manner in which they, have carried on their work. It is most
/ important then that the classes of the present elect men who will con-
. < tinue the work of. the their predecessors. and at the same time, keep
; < 'pace with the progressing Notre Dame. .	- .	.
■ :	, ,The_.qualifications of a candidate are very evident to everyone;
' . they- do not include, however, the ability to. dodge decisions or the abso-
. / lute lack of enemies; Too many candidates are strong merely because
>:■ . they/have pever, raised-their voices loud,enough to make an enemy.
. ./ College men;; choosing' officers to. administer their affairs, spend their
, . money,'-and represent; them as their leader, should find many things to
take into consideration beyond affability and a likeable personality. 1
m.-/;.'It.is.hoped-that-.in the approaching.elections the voters,in our little
- world of campus politics will look beyond.the shimmering garb;of popu-
.'-clarity for the gold of common sense beneath. /	.

The Chicago club will hold its

this evening at 8 o’clock in the Car-
roll “rec” room. The officers to be
elected will take office on July 1,

gible to vote in this election, 0. E.
Desmond, president of the club an-
nounced. In accordance with the
club’s constitution, active members
must be registered at the university
as from Chicago, and not in arrears

must be strictly followed. “Chuck”
CollinsJ the secretary, will be in
Carroll “rec” before the meeting to
collect dues, and compile the eligi-
bility list.
Chicago club elections have excit-
ed much interest in the past, and
the strictness of the regulations
governing tonight’s elections
should attract voters and attention.

FOR MICHIGAN.
There are a great many promis-
ing youngsters in the old high school
“back home” who will graduate this*
June. A large percentage of.thein
are going to college and a surpris-. .
ingly large number of these know
absolutely nothing about/ colleges.’ •
They simply recognize, the. names,"
and usually are well informed as to
the standing of the football teams.
Of the real issues of college life
they are ignorant. ...
During the summer vacations the
men at Michigan will be back once
more in the bld home town. While •
there they will be doing a service
to Michigan and a greater service
to their high school fridnds if 'they •
take/a few minutes of their ’ valua-
ble time to explain colleges' their-
aims, ideals, and relative' riierits in
the fields in which. the. prospective
university students are interested./..
. It is not necessary to coax ,men .
to come to Michigan, if it is to
their greater advantage to attend
some other section of the country
there is ho reason, why thejj should '-
come to Ann Arbor. The difficulty
lies in the fact that the'high school -
boy does not know where his . in-
terest lies. He’will be glad to know ’
what Michigan offers,; whether he '
decides to accept her advantages or<
not. .	’ ’ - •	'	, ■	-.. ;/ .
A better understanding between
the universities and- the high schools
would be of great benefit to both,
and the njost natural and/practical
way to insure this , understanding ,
is through the medium .of the high ■
school alumni who are /the. present/'
Michigan men.—The, Michigan .Dai-

Irish Tennis Team
Returns from Trip
The Notre Dame tennis team en-
gaging its first intercollegiate com-
petition of the year returned Sun-
day from a three game trip through
central Indiana where Butler, In-
diana and Wabash were met on suc-
cessive days.
The squad under the leadership:
of Captain Herm Centlivre, exper-
ienced a varied trip insofar as the
results of the tennis matches were
concerned. Butler and Indiana
triumphed over the Irish court per-
formers only after putting up a
hard fight. Wabash, lost to Notre
Dame when Donovan and. Velasco
scored wins in the singles. *.
The squad .invaded the Butler
courts last Thursday morning and
lost to the Capital city team,' 4 to
1.' The doubles featured the But-
ler engagement with Lutz and Gon-
zalez of Notre Dame defending
their colors against Loglowsky and
Richards of Butler. The downstat-
ers copped the match, 7-5, 4-6, 8-6.
In the second doubles, the victory
again went to Butler, 6-2, 6-1,
Donovan and Centlivre playing for
the Irish and Schroder and Kerz-
rock for Butler. Loglowsky used .a
chop stroke on the. wet courts to
good advantage and had little diffi-
ciilty in defeating Donovan who was
making his first appearance of the
year on the outdoor courts/ Kerz-
rock won over Velasco, 9-7, 6-3,
while Centlivre took advantage of
Richards wildness and copped one
of the singles for the Irish/ 6-3,
6-2.	/
The Blue, and Gold net team
journeyed to Bloomington the fol-
lowing day and lost the match to
Indiana, 5 to 2.. Donovan’s, consis-
tent and at times flashy game was
