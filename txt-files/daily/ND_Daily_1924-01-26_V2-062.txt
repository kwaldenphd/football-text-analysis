“The more you look gentlemen,
1 the less you see!”—P. T. Barnum,
or Houdini, or Ed Wynn said this,
but they never could have meant it
to apply to the delicate task of
conducting a column. The more
the columnyst looks the more he
sees, and, in this particular column,
the more he seizes. •

There is the case of the remark-
able instance of observation by
scout 7-11. He was in class the
other day, an unusual thing in it-
self, and while carelessly looking
over the shoulder of the man in
front of him (it was during a test),
he observed the youth writing in-
dustriously—writing a letter to Mr.
Grundy. .7-11 perceiving the value
of the situation, copied the letter
.word for word, missed the test, and
brought the good news to me. The
letter:-

Charming Sir:	,	_
Clarence Joos, debonair and
. dark-complexioned, senior, has been
mentioned as a potential candidate
for honors in the most handsomely
dressed man contest. Mr. Joos has
the classic features that are so
sought by artists and his pulchri-
- tude merits serious consideration.
The symmetrical figure of Joos
is particularly adapted to doggy
clothes. This young but modern
youth exemplifies the latest in fash-
ions—the snappiest. Joos, be it
affirmed,; scorns the “sheik” style
of; clothes and refuses to adorn

■ garments. :	; .

Scout 7-11 says the industrious
youth referred to above goes by
the initials W. G., commonly called
“Bill.”

P. O’S. reports that while speak-
- ing of well-dressed- men, the name
. of Harold Welch cannot be omitted.
Eddie is a man who is “particular
about quality and careful as to
style.” Will Wimble, one of Sir
Roger de Coverly’s companions,
and an authority on fashions fades
into insignificance upon compari-
son with the dapper Mr. Welsh.

P. O’S", adds as a ,P. S. that the
little details of dress which dis-
tinguish Eddie from the mob, might
properly . be called. “eddio-syncra-

And now,x how does the contest
stand? The latest counting of
'votes have been tabulated under
the watchful, eye of Dr. Jekyll, Mr.
Hyde,- Mr. Grundy, and, to take
care of the feminine interests, Miss
- Grumpy. The latest tabulation in-
dicates that Paul Kennedy, a dark
horse in the race, is running away
.with everything:

The Contest Editor -wishes to
: announce that investigations have
been made regarding the votes cast
f°r'Paul Kennedy, and he finds that

does wish, however, to discourage
' the practice of giving campaign ci-
gars. This should be taken to heart

ENRICH! STARS
AS IRISH BEAT
MICHIGAN AG’S
Aggies Outplayed by N; D,, 35-16;
Over 1000 See Game at
, “Y” Gym,
After running wild the first half
and piling up a huge lead, the
Notre Dame basketball team tram-
pled over the Michigan Aggie quin-
tet, 35-18, on the “Y” court last
night before a crowd of 1,000. The
Irish registered their eighth win in
eleven starts^
Rex Enright, who played the
pivot post in place of Tom Riordan
who was out of the game with an
injury, was the high point man of
the game and the most sensational
performer of the evening. • Enright
displayed a remarkable eye for the
net and caged a total of seven field
goals and three foul goals during
the course of the game. '
The entire Notre Dame squad
showed a brand new type of bas-
ketball compared with the form
that marked the Loyola and Kala-
mazoo games.’ Consistency was
the keynote of their game and their
teamwork resembled the style that
beat the Michigan five early in the
month..
The visiting Aggies were off
form last night and were hardly
a match for the fast traveling
Irish eagers. The Aggies, who
held the Wolverine team to a mar-
gin of four points, had little to
boast of in teamwork and general
floor tactics, but they fought hard
and were in- the game all the way.
The first five minutes of play was
nothing, more. _ than a warming__up
game and very few shots for,..the
basket were registered by either
team. Notre Dame soon opened up

Sophs Announce
Cotillion Program
The sale of tickets for the Sopho-
more Cotillion was opened to up-
per classmen Friday noon, and
by 10 o’clock nearly all of the re-
maining tickets had been sold.
There are only a few left and sev-
eral Sophomores and upper-class-
men will be disappointed if they
fail to get their tickets today.
A special meeting of the Advis-
ory Board was called by' Mark
Mooney, and an additional issue of
50 tickets was proposed. This
would raise the total number to
300. The proposition was discussed
pro' and con,- but was finally
shelved. It will be brought up
again at the next regular meeting
of the board./

TO PRESENT MASCOT TODAY
Because of the absence of Coach
Rockne, the presentation of the
Irish Terrier, the new mascot of
Notre Dame’s athletic teams, was
postponed. The official presenta-
tion will, take place as a feature of
the track meet with Northwestern
at the gym this afternoon. The
mascot is the gift of the Toledo
club.
Interesting Talks at
K. of C. Meeting
Short talks on Knighthood by
prominent members of the South
Bend Council, among them being
Grand Knight Cass, Dr. Berteling,
and Di*. Stoeckleyi featured a well
attended meeting of Notre Dame
Council, No. 1477, Knights of Co-
lumbus, held Thursday evening in
the library.
The newly initiated members re-
ceived their traveling cards, as well
as final instructions regarding the
order. Following several short
speeches by the new members, the
entertainment committee served ice
cream and cake. The council also
provided cigars.
The splendid program of talks
that followed the business meeting
was well received.

BEST ORGANIZATION CONTEST '
WILL CONTINUE TO FEB. 20
Publication Board Agrees that Extension
Will Stabilize Sentiment; Pipe
and Bow] Drops Out
Seniors Will Lower
Price of Ball Tickets
At a meeting of the Senior Ball
Advisory committee Thursday noon
it was officially announced that the
price of the Senior Ball tickets will
be $20.
The Senior Ball committee, in
conjunction with the General Con-
cessions committee, has been work-
ing and planning for weeks to
make the ball a success. It was
realized that.the Senior Ball is ex-
clusively a function for the Senior
class, and that its success, as well
as the success of any class func-
tion, depends upon the number of
Seniors present. With this in view,
the committee has worked to elim-
inate unnecessary extravagances
that perhaps have been in evidence
at past functions of the sort.
Not only will $20 cover the price
of the ball, itself, but it will also
cover all the other entertainment
offered by the Senior class during
ball week.
Although a cut in the price of
ball tickets is unprecedented,, and
although the price as announced is
$5 less than was the cost of last
year’s ball, the committee feels that

HOCKEY AND TRACK
TEAMS PLAY TODAY
Lieb’s Men Will Play I. A. G. Here;
Irish Track Squad Meets
Purdue.
The Notre Dame track arid hock-
ey teams will, make their first ap-
pearance of the season this after-
noon when -Coach Rockne’s squad
of cinder artists go into action
with the Purple crew from North-
western in the Notre Dame gym at
3 o’clock, and Tom Lieb’s hockey
proteges will take on the fast I. A.
C. sextet of Chicago at 1:30 on St.
Mary’s Lake rink. -
The appearance of the Purple
squad here. will be an early test
for the Irish trackmen who have
had about three weeks of training.
The Irish should be' particularly,
strong in- the distance runs, the
sprints and the middle distance
events ,but the lack of veteran ma-
terial in the field events ■will prob-
ably be very noticeable.
. The ice team, which has per-
formed onx foreign rinks three times
so far this season, ■will have to face
some very fast opposition this aft-
ernoon and undoubtlqdly .Chicago
will have the edge for teamwork
and experience to be countered
only by the fighting qualities of the
Notre Dame sextet under the lead-
ership of Frank McSorley. The
probable starting. line-up of the ice
team will include Gillespie at the
goal, Mouch and Feltes on defense,
Stack or Martin at the pivot job,
and McSorley and Magie or Hicpk
at the forwards— '
Tickets for Frolic
Go on. Sale Tuesday
Tickets for the Freshman Frolic
will be placed on sale next Tues-
day in the various halls. The price
has been definitely fixed at $2. The
number of tickets has been limited
to 400. These will be offered only
to members of the class, for a cer-
tain period'of time. Upper class-
men may obtain tickets for the
Frolic at a later date.
After a consultation with the
representatives of the Student Ac-
tivities Committee and the DAILY,
the University Board of Publica-
tions Contest should continue for
a total of 20 issues, instead of the
seven originally planned. At the
end of the contest, which will close
at noon of February 20, the DAILY
will present the winning organiza-
tion with a handsome cup, donated
by Dr. J. A. Stoeckley of South
Bend.

tions at present is:

The Pipe and Bowl has officially
withdrawn from the contest.
The DAILY wishes to announce
that the seal on the ballot box was
broken some time around noon
Thursday, all votes cast Thursday
morriing, approximately 70 in num-
ber, were stolen from the box. It
is needless to denounce the men
who stole these ballots when there
was no one in the DAILY office.
But the DAILY wishes to rectify
the effect. of this unfortunate in-
cident and requests that all who
cast their votes on Thursday morn-
ing come to the room , of the Con-
test Editor, 237 Walsh, to examine
the vote. If their ballots of Thurs-
day morning are not among the
votes they may recast them.
Attention is again called to the
fact that voters need not use the
ballot printed in the DAILY pro-
vided they observe the regular
form. Furthermore, if any man
who has given his proxy to another
wishes to withdraw that proxy he
need only inform the man to whom
he gave his proxy to that effect.
The. ballots already counted are
divided into groups, according to
their number, and the groups are
arranged alphabetically. This sys-
tem aims to detect any fraudulent
duplication of 'votes. These votes
are open to inspection at any time.
The decision of the University
Board of Publication follows: “In
view of the fact that there has been
some dis-safisfaction, due to charges
of soliciting votes, and that some
of. the organizations have done work
that does not come to the eyes of
the students, the Board of Publica-
tions feels that a decision at pres-
ent would not "represent the more
enlightened view on the campus
and that possibly the award .of the
cup might be infelicitous, and

“He is wise who knows his own
limitations.” One’s first reflection
on reading this is that it concedes
too much to the average man. Foi’
does not the average man know, in-
deed, is he not keenly aware of his
own limitations? . Nothing is' more
common than to hear people can-
didly confess that they either do
not know or cannot do certain
things. Moreover, do ,not many
who make no claim to wisdom con-
stantly yearn for more knowledge,
more power, and that precisely be-
cause they are conscious of their
very limited supply of both?
Is it, like most proverbs, but a half-
truth, and have we seized upon the
untrue half? Or is it one of' those
paradoxes which say 'one thing and
mean another? We do not pretend
to decide. Only it seems that it
must contain some sense. For no
philosopher would essay “to var-
nish nonsense with the charms
sound.”
Perhaps the answer may
found in probing the meaning

BENEVOLENT ADVERSITY
Every man likes compliments and dislikes abuse. If the end were
considered, the contrary-should be. true, for compliments are usually
harmful, abuse usually beneficial.
Compliments cause self-satisfaction, kill ambition and make a
felicitated fool feel superior, make him arrogant, static if not-.retro;
gressive. ‘The rude jolt of-consciousness that comes is hard and cruel,
but good; it reminds one that he is inferior and foolish, and not a god.
Men advance because of abuse. Adversity produces better men
? than does lazy luxury. The derided man strives to show his worth.
The strong man grows by abuse, tile weak man strives to be strong.
Adversity, makes football teams and nations; it strengthened Jean Val-
jean, Jeanne d’Arc, Portia, Prospero, Pope, Keats, the saints, and the
Catholic church. It kills the spiritless, but it vivifies the sleeping spirit.
SPORT THAT WRINKLED CARE DERIDES
. Lincoln’s impression of college is like that of many men. Speak-
ing-of a visit to Yale he said “There were a lot of students sitting on
- the-fence across the street,, and they were singing, ‘My old horse, he
:came.from Jerusalem, came from Jerusalem, came from Jerusalem.’”
'/Lincoln felt that college was too ;much like this, too much a place of
•. hilarity, of good time. If he could walk across the* Notre Dame
. dampus on the right night at the right time he might .get much the
‘ same impression. About 9:30 he might hear, coming from a Sorin
. window, the strident notes of “Sittin’ in a Corner,” with violin accom-
paniment by an ambitious Sorin hall musician. From the path that
leads to the cafeteria he might hear shrill bass' voices singing “Crossin’
of . the Jordan.” In a Corby room he might hear juniors giving a
’freshman confidential information about joining a new organization,
the initiation to which was severe, but the honor of which was bound-
less, since even some of the faculty—but only a select few—were
members and were privileged to be saluted by the clever secret sign.
•: He might come back bn another. night and hear cheering students
packed in a gymnasium for a basketball game. -
Lincoln: would return to his grave and mutter with others that
college life was too enjoyable to be-a preparation for after-life. With
Dr. Sihler, of New York University, he might say: “Enjoyment of
luxury,, ease for four years, and a little study on the side constitute
‘ satisfactory fulfillment of the requirements for a college degree. With
'the present system of ‘snap’ courses, industry and hard study are no
: longer part of a college man’s life.”
. But would. Lincoln, Sihler and the other critics be right?
It is a question to which the student answers “No”, for he believes
that most college men do not loaf too much, and that the drudge cannot
‘be a success.-. He believes that the critics have only seen one, and a
•necessary side, of college life. Work, infernally hard work, is neces-
sary, strict scholarship regulations are good, but too much work wrecks
men—and there are many examples, some at Notre Dame. An over-
worked body (one professor at Notre Dame says there is'no such thing
liere, and he may be almost right) cannot bear the strain. Now and
then it needs to_be relieved of its burden, so that it will not become1
cramped and weak. “Now and then the mind must be rid of classroom
burdens, and the spirit let play, that, it may then carry the load the
.better. /.,	*	,	'	'	*	'
Our colleges are full of young
men. pursuing an education. This
in itself is an admission on their
part of limited' perfection. Must
we then admit that they are all
wise men? Such indeed would be
an astonishing aggregation, a queer
lot. Two thousand wise men
brought together under one roof!
History itself, we think, offers no
precedent for that. Wise men do
not seem to herd. They. lose the
gregarious instinct with the. ap-
proach of wisdom. For wisdom
must be courted in solitude. So the
ancients maintained.
The modern view is somewhat
different. It holds that there . is
much wisdom to be found in dis-
cussion and more in close observa-
tion and rich experience; it ap-
proves mingling much . with the
crowd. But this change of view is
due largely to an altered concept
of wisdom 'itself. It used to be-
thought that wisdom was the vision
of things in their highest causes;
that it was synonymous with spec-
ulative thought, philosophy^ . Today
he may be accounted wise who pos-
sesses merely the “amassed thought
and experience of innumerable
minds.” What once was wisdom
has largely come to be regarded as
idle fancy, and the title of wise-
man has been handed over to the
merely erudite,—-a limitation which
is distinctly^unwise. • -r .
the term “wise.” . Or. in delimiting
the import of “limitations.” If we
say that he is prudent who realizes
that there are certain accomplish-
ments he does not possess, and who
acts accordingly, we should express
the. real state of affairs with less
of epigram, perhaps, but with more
of sobriety. In this sense, those
are indeed wise who strenuously
keep silent. ;
One may be limited. Indeed, the
most passing acquaintance with
ourselves appraises us of that. We
know of -a certain theologian who
professed to be insulted at the mere
insinuation that perhaps he was
without limits. For, said he, that
would be tantamount to denying
that he was a man, and suggesting
that he might be only an ooze or a
flow. Mari’s dignity then, it would
seem, as well as his nature, de-
mands limits. It does not . require
wisdom,' though it doubtless is
greatly enhanced by it.
So what becomes of our-proverb?
It seems, 1 therefore, that our
proverb means only that he is wise
who fully realizes that he is but a
man. For if wisdom be taken in
the sense, of philosophy, then it
may indeed become very silly.
And it usually becomes so especial-
ly by forgetting that, after all,
man IS only man, and not a diety.
Real philosophy, genuine wisdom,
never forgets that. -Pseudo-phil-
osophy always does, and in one way
or another either defies man or hu-
manizes God. To realize our own-
limitations is to take a humble view
of ourselves, and in humility there
is indeed much wisdom.

You might have the Yanks with-

Gallagher without Shean, but you
certainly wouldn’t have much of a
1 sll0W at the Palace this week if
Henry Santrey and Ann Seymour
were not on hand to keep things
moving. Without • them the bill
would be as flat as the proverbial
tire; with them, it is good.
The headliner is, of course, San-
trey with his' twelve-piece orches-
tra. They play syncopated and
classical selections in a manner
that doesn’t fail to ring the bull’s-
eye of public approval. Santrey’s
singing and an excellent harp solo
by one of'his orchestra are prac-
. tically bright spots in this act.
Ann and Harry Seymour have a
very clever act, wherein Ann must
be held responsible for most of the
entertainment. From the very first
this little actress meets' the audi-
ence and they are hers. Harry’s
dancing and Miss Seymour’s gen-
eral fun-making proclivities make
this act a real success.
The Ardell Brothers (no rela-
tion) have, a fair acrobatic act that
got by rather nicely, thank you.,
Brenck’s Golden Horse concludes
the vaudeville. If you have -never
seen a horse do the Camel Stretch,,
stay for this act. The kiddies will

That’s the question you naturally
ask when you are seeing. “Enemies

the plot getting, hopelessly compli-.
cated. For a concise , criticism con-
sult the ‘dictionajry of synonyms

At this time let us rise to utter
_a strong,..manly protest, against, the
policy of the Palace in consuming
half, an hour of valuable time to
advertise coming attractions as. far
as three weeks in advance. We
have already seen Houdini thrown
into the bay three times, by actual
count. Something should be done

Irish Golfers May
Use Indoor Course
The; Notre Dame golf team, or-
ganized, last fall with several prac-
tice matches with ' near-by clubs,
has very recently received an in-
vitation from Bert Meyering, prom-
inent Chain-’o-Lakes ; professional
to take advantage of, the indoor
golf course being conducted for the
second year by Mr. Meyering at
225. South Michigan street. '
The. Irish golf team, beginning
preparations for the spring season,
is looking forward to a revival of
golf interest among the students.
On the basis of a large number of
candidates turning . out for the
team, Manager Ward is negotiating
■ with several conference schools for
matches to be played on South
Bend links. .	■.■■•.
Mr. Meyering, who is assisted by
Harry Elmore in working with sev-
eral candidates for the team who
have recently taken up the indoor
Practice, has shown much interest
' in the Notre Dame golf team since
. its organization last fall. Dut to
the presence in school of several
• promising golfers who have given
splendid exhibitions on the South
Bend.links, Mr. Meyering is confi-
dent that a winning team can be
turned out in the Irish school, where
a_golf team is one of the latest ad-
ditions to the sport curriculum.
. The value of the indoor practice
ls incalcuable to the candidates for
the team which will be picked in
- the spring after several practice
batches, have' been played off. It
^ill give the men a chance to turn
out in the ‘ spring in better form
-for the outdoor work.	‘
4 small fee will be charged for
Practice on the course, which con-
sists of three driving-nets and a
uirie-hole putting course. Regular

Editor NOTRE DAME DAILY:
While looking through your pro-
gressive DAILY of last Saturday’s
issue, I ran across an article en-
titled, “Pipe and Bowl Club.” The
article striking my interest, and 1
never having heard of the organiza-
tion before, I read on, finally com-
ing to the words, “sponsored for
fellowship.”
Since when, at Notre Dame, has
it become necessary for any or-
ganization to sponsor fellowship?
The very foundation of Notre Dame
is fellowship—every man knows
that when his foot first touches the
campus. It is the very thing that
every Notre Dame man, freshman
or senior, holds sacred within his
heart. Is it necessary that a club,
if I may call it such, (and I may
be wrong) having all the ear-marks
and characteristics of a fraternity,
be sponsored to promote fellowship
—by a few select individuals?
From -all indications, my dear
editor, it looks as if there are cer-
tain individuals who consider
themselves better than the rest, by
taking upon their manly shoulders
the heavy task and ever-tiring
burden; that of promoting fellow-
ship at Notre Dame. Here we are
fortunate in having “Masculine De-
mocracy”—that which so many col-
leges strive for and so few attain.
As is so clearly demonstrated at
other institutions, the adherence to
fraternal restrictions necessitates a
weakening of tht spirit of unity of
purpose and activity which is so
prevalent at Notre Dame. With
the coming of this situation to
Notre Dame, the true spirit for
which it is dedicated is bound to be
crushed under the heal of fraternal-
ism-—the strong arm of the dis-
criminating.
So, in conclusion, dear editor, I
will ask you-to enlighten , me upon
the question (and I have been here
four years)—“Since when has it be-
come necessary for any individual
or group of select individuals to as-
sume the responsibility of promot-
ing fellowship at Notre Dame?
I would rather have the select
group ask to organize a fraternity
(and I never wish to see that day
at Notre Dame) than hide behind
so good and true a thing as Notre
Dame fellowship.
Don’t let that happen—Notre
Dame fellowship is too dear to
Notre Dame men!!
Very respectfully yours,’
A NOTRE DAME STUDENT.
To the Editor of the DAILY: •
We have watched with interest
the attempt of numerous students
to answer Endymion’s sincere
query: “What is a cake-eater”?
At the beginning we resolved to
take no. part in the quibbling oyer
the meaning of an over-used, word,
but when this argument reached
the point where freshmen at a
man’s institution such as this is are
permitted to tell upper-classmen
just what they think of them, we
could no longer remain silent.
Everybody seems to have a dif-
ferent idea of a cake-eater. Some
think that he is one who wears a
“tie and white collar,” but this
seems ,preposperous after the recent
ruling of the faculty on class-room
and refectory -attire. Surely the
faculty is not accessory to this ne-
farious attempt to make cake-eaters
of us all. ’ Others are inclined to
stigmatize with this epithet those
who wash their faces every day and
have their hair cut more than once
a month, but we dismiss this as
anti-barber shop propaganda.
. To get to the heart of the matter
matter, a cake-eater is not neces-
sarily any one of these things. As
most of us use the term a cake-
eater is one who has something
that we haven’t but which we would
give our right eye to possess.
Someone has a tux; I haven’t—
therefore he is a cake-eater. I
call up the girl to make a date for
a talk-fest; she is “so sorry but so-
and-so, has-just asked her to a
formal dance”; therefore, so-and-so
is a blankety-blank" cake-eater as
far as I am Concerned. Eurynome
has shapely . legs and can wear
knickers without any sense of em-
barrassment; my legs, bowed by the
manly sport of horse-back riding,
will not permit such liberties;
therefore Eurynome is a cake-eater.
(Some of you will not get this Eury-
nome stuff; from my point of view
that makes you cake-eaters.)
We have done our best to add to
the confusion in this futile quib-
bling—futile because we do not be-
lieve that there are any cakc-eaters
at Notre Dame.	.
. J. F. H., ’24.
E. T. L., ’25.
D. J. O’N., ’26.
P. S.—If the editor does not print
this he is a cake-eater.
EDITOR’S NOTE: In view of
an anonymous letter signed “Facis-
ti,” rebuking the DAILY for its
rule that anonymous writers must
allow the DAILY to know their
names, the following editorial from
the New York University Daily
News should be interesting:	.
“Irving Connors”
A person should not be ashamed
of his opinions. No matter how
radical his ideas may be, so long
as they are' honest, he should not
be afraid to stand by them.
Recently^ in our student opinion
column, a letter signed “Irving
Connors” appeared. It was very
hostile in tone and if the accusa-
tions are true, it is a serious mat-
ter. Now, if a student by the name
of “Irving Connors” really believes
what he said, it is perfectly proper
that he be allowed to express him-
self. That is what the column is
for, student opinion.
Investigation, however, has re-
vealed that there is no student by
the name of “Irving Connors” in
the University.
This is unfair and has proven
that even in their own opinions,
some student, or a certain student
at least, cannot be honest. And,
lest the whole thing lead to a gen-
eral influx of malicious letters, the
staff of the “Daily News” is going
to try to check up carefully on each
signature before publication.
This, however, does not set a
limit bn student free-speech. The
column is open to all who -wish to
use'it* * properly. ~Say~what'you'will'
but let us know who you are.
The Senior class jpf Eureka Col-
lege has revived an old custom of
burying a. fruit cake at the begin-
ning of their senior year and un-
earthing it at-commencement time
for a feast. It was customary for
the juniors, . provided they suc-
ceeded in finding the . cake,. to
change its hiding place, and let it
reniain there until their senior
year. - ’	.	’

“Fighting Irish’’ Once Performed at
Dizzy Heights on Chimney Top
“Highest Fight on Record Held
at Notre Dame” was the headline
carried on the front page of a local
newspaper .in 1899. To the stu-
dents of the University, it was a
most startling disclosure, second
only to a description of one of
John L.’s triumphs.
Records galore have been made
and broken by the athletes of Notre
Dame. They have been -written of
and announced to the sport loving
public by headlines, but it is doubt-
ful indeed if any student recalls
this record, if it may rightfully be
classed as one, which was made in
a most unique manner with but
few spectators present.
It was at this time that the
heating plant of the University was
being constructed. Work-on the
boilers had progressed to such an
extent that construction of the
chimney was begun. Two husky
sons of Erin, who were .masons,
were assigned this work. '
Construction of the chimney had
reached a certain stage and approx-
imately 165,000 bricks had been
laid by the two men, .when it be-
came necessary only to place the
coping or top ring on the struc-
ture to complete it.
While engaged in this task, one
worker, who had consumed some-
thing not altogether to Mr. Vol-
sted’s liking, grew quarrelsome and
with the intention apparently to rid
the world of an individual who be-
lieved in prohibition, or to convince
him of his -wrong opinion, engaged
in a heated argument with his fel-
low workman, which threatened to
terminate in a fight and consequent
death of one or both. '
Silhouetted against the sky, 165
feet above the ground, with a cir-
cular platform 7 feet in diameter
for a ring, and with some 240 tons
of bricks for a foundation, the un-
ruly one could be seen swaying to
and fro, while his companion, who
realized the dangers .of such an en-
counter, wisely-refrained from in-
citing to a greater pitch the anger
of his crazed helper. ‘
Matters came to a point, how-
ever, when the one who was bent
on_imitating, the .. tactics ._of. the
“Fighting Irish”' of that year (when
they defeated the Michigan Aggies,
53-0, on the gridiron) got no op-
position. This terminated the' in-
cident which' might have resulted
disastrously, for how can an Irish-
man fight when he can find no one
who will oppose him? •
Soon after the chimney was com-,
pleted and it was the same. two
Irishmen who had read their “rec-
ord” in the newspaper, that com-
pleted the work.	-

fights for ‘free verse’ as for the

he fight? If ‘free verse’ is musical,
if it expresses a mood dr an emo-
tion or a thought in terms that ap-

the imagination, why should it be
necessary to fight for it?”

All Games Will Be Close'; Car-

Undefeated.
- Interhsdl basketball teams will
. clash in the gymnasium tomorrow
morning and afternoon to play off
the third series of games on the in-
terhall schedule. The Carroll and
Day Dodgers’ teams have so far
succeeded in keeping clean their
records, each having two games in
the win column and have yet to
lose their first games. The Brown-
son and Cadillac loopers have failed
to get in the winning column so
far, each having suffered two de-
feats. The six remaining teams,
Sorin, Freshman, Sophomore, Badin,
Corby and Walsh, are all credited
. with one victory and one defeat. To
date it is hard to pick any outstand-
ing favorite, all games being unus-
ually close.
.The Carroll and Corby tossers
will start the battles tomorrow
morning when they meet in the
gym at 9:30. The other teams will
play as follows:
Sophomore vs. Sorin—10:30 to
12:00.;
Badin vs. Cadillac, 1:30 to 2:30.
Walsh vs. Day—2:30 to 3:30.

Post-Exam Dance
The. Villagers have announced
that their .third annual Post-Exam
dance will be held Saturday, Feb-
ruary 2. The present arrange-
ments include music by the Music
Masters, and the Tribune auditor-
ium, according to the committee in
charge.
The dance, held yearly by the
Villagers at the end of the mid-
year examinations, has established
itself as one of the social events of
the year. , The committee, with this
in mind, is preparing a dance that
will, if possible, exceed former ef-
forts of the club.
In order that no interference
with examinations will occur tickets
will be placed on sale Sunday. Thus
ample time is provided for the stu-
dent body to make any necessary
arrangements before the advent of
the quarterlies.
The dance is being given in co-
operation with the S. A. C., so that
tickets will be sold at the uniform
price of $1.50. Dancing will con-
tinue from 8:30 to 12:00. Further
announcement regarding permis-
sions, features, and tickets will be
ma'de within the next few days.
Talk on Birdbahding
Given to Scientists
“Birdbanding” was the subject of
a lecture delivered by Mr. W. I.
Lyons, secretary of. the Inland Bird
Association, yesterday, in Science
hall. The lecture was illustrated by
the use of slides'.
Mr.-Lyons, who has had years of
experience in this work, was secured
by our own bird enthusiast, Brother
Alphonsus. He told of the work
now going on and described in de-
tail the method of capturing and
banding the wild birds. The pur-
pose of the banding is to discover
further facts concerning the lives
and migratory habits of the birds.
The investigations is being made
under the supervision of the United
States Biological Survey.

and grabbed a lead of five points
before the Aggies were able’ to find
the basket. Notre Dame was never
headet^ and continued their fast
pace and smooth game right up to
the final whistle.
Kizer, Crowe and Mahoney start-
ed the scoring with two field goals
and one free throw. The Aggies
were unable to cope with , the Irish
attack and resorted to a defensive
game in an effort to stem the rush
of baskets. Rex Enright started his
deadly work and rung up two bas-
kets in quick succession. The Ag-
gies found great difficulty in drib-
bling through the Irish ranks and
the back guards were heaving long
passes that flivvered under the bas-
ket due to the perfect interference
of Mahoney.
Crowe, Kizer, Mahoney, and
Mayl contribuated six baskets dur-
ing this period while , the sharp-
shooting Enright found the net for
five counts and a foul goal. The
flashy , center registered on nearly
every try for the basket and wasted
but few shots. The middle of the
first half found the count standing
at 13-3. The Aggies were in a
sea of speeding cagemen and they
were unable to handle the ball with
any. effectiveness. Kizer, Crowe and
Enright were playing a whale of
an offensive game and Mayl and
Mahoney^ were a stone Wall to the
Aggies’ attack, which flivvered sad-
ly in the half and the garnered
only two' field goals and five foul
goals.
The guarding of the Irish eagers
was particularly noticeable in this
period. The shots of Enright were
made clean and followed clevei’ pas.
work.
The second half opened with the
Aggies offering more competition
than they did in the previous per-
iod, and they kept the Irish scor-
ing down to three field goals. The
Maylmen, however, continued their
exceptional floor game, and the
Aggies saw very little of the basket,
only registering two field goals and
five free throws. The visitors were
hard pressed and .their game lost
form as the half • neared the end.
The" Aggies were substituting fre-
quently in an effort to solve the
Irish defense, but to no avail. Ma-
honey was. following the ball every
minute and gave the visitors little
opportunity to find the net.
The entire change of form on
the part of the Maylmen resulted
from a week of hard practice ses-
sions during which time Coach Keo-
gan drilled the men on basket
shooting and general floor tactics.
The loss of last Saturday combined
with the none too brilliant opposi-
tion offered by the Michigan farm-
ers, resulted in a fine exhibition of
basketball. -
With their brilliant return to
the form displayed during the early
part of the month, the Notre Dame

SECURE BETTER CAR SERVICE
Two noon'Ndtre Dame street cars
have been secured by the Student
Activities Committee . for . the ac-
commodation of students who eat
meals in South Bend. It was found
impossible, however, to ■ obtain

cept Saturday. Efforts are being
made by the S. A. C. to arrange
for 11:30 or 11:45 o’clock bus ser-
vice.

taking a step is the right direction,
and are putting such functions more
