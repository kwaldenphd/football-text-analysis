The Colyum; had. a bad night.
Don’t know what was the cause of
it. Kinda think it was top much
golf yesterday,,so it begs permission
to allow the. Armchair Philosopher
to pace up and down the colyum to
the extent of about 600 bread-earn-
ers. He says he can murder verse-
beautifully, write prose horribly,
and crack poor jokes unflinchingly
—with such qualifications we could-
n’t’ keep him out. He’ll make, a
wonderful colyumist, if he doesn’t
become afraid of the footlights. We
introduce the. Philosopher? Orches-

A Sloppy Fable by the A. P.
(With apologies to none.) .
In the days, B. V. D.? when every
coffee bean was a Life Saver, and'
every shoe sole a metal polisher;
there guzzled a pair of dizzy, dukes,
who hung onto.the birth records? by
the strings, Josephus and Bohunkus.
Being no kith or kin to the “Joseph-
us and Bohunkus,” of donkey fame,
neither merited the<Hair of Fame.
But by the by, so to speak, this guy
Josephus got to conceiving his mar-
celled hair -as harboring 'rare and
valued microbes; Bohunkus,. being
of opposite- constituency,' made no
such pretensions,^—bony of fist, and
sturdy of wrists, he could hold his
own against the: best bartender that
ever pulled a Camel. While Bo-
hunkus’ battled ■'- manfully ; through
his mortal program, Josephus had
to be.accompanied with.a block and
tackle-, to keep 'his heck from -tele-
scoping with 'his Paris garters. Of
such natures-were the two.- . ;
It so happened that on Christmas
Eve in the year • when ~women got
suffrage.away'’from the men, there
convenedan the mucilage parlor of
Tommy Sword, the. champion sewers
of . every precinct. ; Incidentally -it
so happened that’the two opposing
funnel gangs lined up against- each
other'lead respectively by the broth-
ers, Josephus and Bohunkus.- Sez
Jo to Bo, .“Bo/I can drink you un-
der /the table,/anytime, anywhere,
and TIL do -it.now.’’ Sez -Bo. back' to
Jp, “Jo, you’re a^iar.” So the fight,
began. .For fdrby days’ 'and forty,
.-nights?- ’
- time, ;un	Josepwreryon'-a
flower-laden.'-bflrge? floated away;
while :.fiis:-courageous brother; ah;
it is sad\to chronicle—lay back, in
Tommy’s, club on the floor—dead—
dead—drunk.	The judge .wasn’t
sure who, won,. so?he-gives them each
30 days on’the farm. t
Moral:/. A* lotta-..fellows in.' this
life, spend, their spare hours,.fight-
ing bumble, beesrwasps, and wind-
mills, -without . getting anything-, for
their efforts: except wilted; flowers.
The fighter;,who gets the palm these
days is the man who spars around in
a library, and: joins in? the parlor
and lobby fights. . A is nothing
more than- a fight, until a" worthy
principle , is -involve	: be-
comes a crusade.

TRADITIONS AND FRESHMEN
■ The Student Activities Committee is undertaking the: publication of
a booklet on Notre Dame tradition. .The booklet, will contain a resume
: of college customs, a : student -directory: of. .information and remarks
pertinent to Notre Dame life. The purpose of .the publication is to
' : acquaint the. new^man^with .Notre Dame; •	:	’ .-	” .
: Traditions are by far the most important element in the'life of the
.college-man? They are.: the soul of .universities, that .which makes a
' man love his scliool-and figlit for her., Notre Danie traditions have been
•' ^neglected, but,now, with’the movement for, -a Greater Notre Dame,, they

CLUBBING CLUBS
' :, J ;Notre Dame lias always been oppose^-to frats; and for good reason.
Frats.split student bodies into segments/ and if;there is- one thing Notre
, Dame, stands fory it is -an undivided - student body. ‘ Notre- Dame is one
. big fraternity. -A/spirit, of- friendly rivalry exists between halls; and;
.-to, some .extent^, between classes^ but-with’, a few exceptions., the clubs
do not strive to: outdo Dne; another.” There is room and reason for city
. and -state rivalry^ the kind of rivalry that-keeps university .standards in
’ : . mind^. and;makes, the rivalry ;tend ’to .a .furthermcnt of' Notre Dame
', spirit, ideals and name. -
State and city- pride" exist at Notre Dame, but it is manifested in
hardly more than jocose bragging—with a few exceptions.’ Dances/
■ JrBtertainments, banquets, - and .other club ■ activities,, are needed to justify
- the-existence” of most of the clubs*”/The activities ,of'some clubs—
> "Toledo, Indianhpolis/ Rochester, Cleveland; and so on—are: worthwhile?
; They advertise Notre Dame, they, bind the students together, and
result in strong and unified'alumni. • •	'	• ,
? The Student Activities Committee has a plan to remedy the situa-
tion.' Only clubs with a punch will be allowed to live.. Those who do no-
.more than smile for Dome pictures will have smiled their last smiles, for
and.the students must and will end the'days of dead wood.

The Techno-Log
■ Chemical. Engineering Trip .
Sunday evening, May 27, the jun-
ior and senior ’ chemical engineers
• returned' from an inspection trip
covering the chief industrial plants
in Chicago and nearby. Tim Rauh,
’ Gerald Kremp, Charles Robrecht,
William Bailey, Robert Quinn, and
Levi Geniesse made the trip by
automobile, under Mr.. Byrne. .
At the Illinois Steel Company’s
>' plant in Gary, the party was shown
< the processes of making steel, blast
furnace, open-heart furnace, and
•.. Bassemer; converter methods. At
■ Buffington; Ind., -they visited the
Universal' Portland Cement Com-
pany plant, and were shown . the
•, processes of grinding,, crushing, and
drying cement. >. They were als'o
’ shown through the plant’s chemical
and physical testing laboratories.
The next stop was the refining
works of the Standard Oil Co., at
' Whiting, Ind. Here they , had as a
- guide, Dr. McNeil; who explained
the Burton-process for cracking of.
• oils, and his own process for mak-.
• ing fancy candles/ The engineers
' spent the night in Hammond- and
/ ’ "left' early .the next j morning for
Grasselli,- Ind., to see 'the manufac-
ture of heavy chemicals-at the Gras-
' selli: Chemical Plant; Mr. Irwin,
assistant superintendent, ■ showed
: the men through .the buildings, and
explained the making.of. sodium sil-
i • icate, waterglass,, sulphuric acid by
the chamber process, hydrochloric
■ and nitric commercial acids, and
■ chemically pure nitric acid. ,
. They lunched at East Chicago
; and then visited the electrolytic pro-
' cess plant of the U. S; Metal Refin-
ing Corporation. Mr. Mulligan,
plant’ superintendent, acted-- as
' - - guide; showing the refining of lead,
’ 'the recovery of silver and gold, tlie
manufacture . of hydrofluoric acid,
and the processes'-of the assaying
laboratory. At the Sherwin-Wil-
liams paint worksj they were shown
the manufacture -of pigments by.
■ < precipitation, the uses, of . filter-
f ‘ • presses and dryers, land the . old
Dutch method' of making, white lead.
In Chicago the party .went to the
/ Central Scientific Co., where they
l5/^^werci?^ver^a"*rtalk<~on^laboratory
: equipment by.Mr. Garter, industrial
■ sales manager. .. Lafer.- they . were
: .taken through the display rooms and-
shown the types. of' special appa-
'ratus made by the company. ; ?
■ To get- an idea of the}practical
- - ; operation - of an industrial. organic
laboratory, the , next-. place, visited
c - was. the Miner Laboratories • on. Clin-
> ton Street, Chicago. • This- stop was
planned purposely to show- that, in
■ practical manufacture,, apparatus, is
• a chosen more for durability and-serv-.
. iceability than for appearance; The
; processes seen ;at this .plant"- were
< = chiefly of the foodstuff field.. ■ .
< .Friday afternoon they visited the
! ; stock yards of Swift'Go. . Here
■j ■ Mr. -Taylor, superintendent of the
. soap factory, explained the steps in
■ the making; of laundry and toilet
. jsoaps,' in the; distillation of fatty
acids, an din the purification of
glycerine and edible oils. ■	’ : .
. . On Friday the Pharmacists routed
the Miners in a slug-fest that-ended
8-15. After the fatal second inning
when- the Pill Makers scored, seven
runs the Miners were unable, to
overcome the • big handicap. Loose
fielding by the Miners and timely
hitting by the Pharmacists tells the
v,-hole story. King’s . pitching was
good; and Herold was high tally
man! for the rPill’ Makers,, scoring
four|runs. The stick work of Gene
Sullivan and Dumbkowski helped to
keep the Ground Hogs in the run-
ning.

Friday afternoon the Miners re-,

The game featured the left fielder

catches. Hard hitting on both sides
and some good base running helped
to make the game exciting at times.

Postpone Revue
Until Next Year
The-junior class play, which was
to have been presented on Friday
night, June 9, as a part of the Com-
mencement exercises, lias been post-
poned 'until Homecoming eve next
year.' The reason for postponing
the play is that the producers and
the actors are unable to give enough
time to the production to warrant
the good play they intend to make it.

Says Rummy Wins
Are Rummy Affairs
A rummy tournament is on in
Sorin Hall.
“The games are only- practice
matches,” says Rusty.Kennedy,-who
with Joe Troman and Frank Ped-
rotty, claims the rummy champion-
ship of' the University. “They are
but rummy champs, not champions
of rummy.”
Neil Flinn, John' Fogarty and
Tom Lee, who were victorious in
the recent matches, have merely
been the means of divertisement for
the real champs, while Fogarty, of
bear hunt fame and creator of sil-
ver tip, and Flinn, hockey star, are
really of the duffer flight, according
to report.	-
Some means - of determining the
status of the games will be arranged
by a committee of Emery Toth.

Sheehan, Foley and Bergman
Out of-Game With
Injuries
The Purdue baseball team pulled
into South Bend last night, and will
play the. varsity today at Cartier
field. ■ The Irish are in poor condi-
tion to meet the Boilermakers who
have been traveling at a fast clip
- this season.. Sheehan, the star
shortstop, has been out of the game
- since the Northwestern game and it
is not likely .that he will play tomor-
- . row although Coach Halas may use
him at the last minute. - Danny
*■ Foley smashed two fingers in the
Iowa game and-it is doubtful wheth-
er he will play at second.
■ Dutch Bergman twisted his ankle
at the Knights of Columbus game
. at Michigan City Sunday, and will
be out. of the game for the rest of
. the season. Bergman is playing his
best game of the season as lead-off
man and has been, hitting the ball
• hard. With Sheehan and Foley out,
the ■ infield will be considerably
weakened.. At present Kane is play-
ing in Sheehan’s place with' Ver-
■ gara at third, but with Foley out it
. is doubtful who will be in the in-
field? ,On . account of the many
- changes in the lineup lately, 'Coach
Halas has a difficult proposition be-
fore him.	?
Either Falvey or Magevney will
pitch, for Castner will be needed to
bolster up the outfield.r Both men
. have been hurling good ball. Mag-
evney held Knox to four hits ■ and
. no runs i last Friday, and Falvey let
Iowa down with two hits, Saturday.
Falvey shut out Purdue with three
. hits earlier in the season and the
Boilermakers will make a hard fight
to even the count. One of the men
. will have . to be saved to pitch
against Michigan on. Memorial Day.
. Purdue will play Indiana on.Friday.
The game with Michigan on Wed-
nesday will be the biggest game of
the season. Michigan, almost cer-
