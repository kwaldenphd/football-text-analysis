The Notre Dame track team,
breaking three of the local gym rec-
ords, scored a spectacular win oyer
Wisconsin, 47 2-3 to 38’ 1-3, in a
dual track meet in the Irish gym
yesterday afternoon.
Coach Rockne’s proteges uncov-
ered a wealth of unusual strength
in every event except the high jump
and set the pace for the Badgers
during the entire meet. The vis-
itors from Wisconsin fought hard
in every event and were denied the
meet only when Notre Dame won
the mile relay race in commanding
fashion. McTiernan, Hamling,
Barr and Eaton composed the relay
quartet which, after having been
driven hard for the first half mile,
crossed the finish line in 2:39 4-5,
setting a new gym record for the
relay. The old record, 3:30 2-5, was
set in 1922 by one of the cleverest
relay teams that ever represented
the Blue and Gold.
Kennedy Wins .
The high point of the meet was
reached when Paul Kennedy won
the -mile race in 4:21, defeating
Cassidy of the Badgers, who pressed
the Irish captain for three-quarters
of a. mile. Kennedy won his race
with one of the most spectacular
finishes that has ever been wit-
nessed at Notre Dame. Although
defeated in two' previous meets
this year, Kennedy’ has been grad-
ually bettering his time. Kennedy,
running anchor on the medley relay
team that won the university med- :
ley'relay .'race at the Illinois Car-
nival . last "week, won his mile in
4:23 3-5. .
Leo McTiernan entered track his-
tory at Notre Daihe by crashing
the third record of the afternoon.
McTiernan took the lead at the
> start of the; quarter mile run and
I never lost it, winning the event in
। :51 3-5. The former, record was
(established by Devine of Notre
Dame in 1911 in :52 1-2.
Wendland Tawes Two-Mile -
Johnny (Wendland, winning the
two mile in 9:44 3-5, came next in
the order of record setters. Al-
though he did not better the mark
set by'Joie Ray in 1912, Wendland
is the first Notre Dame student that
1 ever, registered a win* in the_two-
5 mile in 9:44 3-5. ; The Irish dis-
tance star, ran a . smooth race arid-
; handled himself ( well .despite fre-' , ■
; quently changing lead. The Badger
runners monopolized the lead for
the greater part, of the race while
Wendland was saving his strength.
Perry of Wisconsin was leading at
the nineteenth lap, but was passed
by Wendland at the beginning of ,
the twenty-first. Wendland picked ‘
up .on his; time by a remarkably fast
finish which gave: him a wih< 15
yards ahead of his rival. \	.

tance men ever developed at Wis-

OVER, THE -FOOTLIGHTS, Stephen Lea-
cock. Dodd, . Mead and Company. New
York. 1923.
Those of us who like our humor
fairly well diagramed owe a special
debt of . gratitude to Stephen Lea-
cock, and those who feel that this
debt should be paid should read
“Over The Footlights.” It is not
so good as .Leacock’s earlier works,
such as/ “Nonsense Novell
or,
PARDONABLE LIARS
The girls at Wellesley are going to speak the truth in social mat-
ters—so they say. It is absolutely wrong, they have determined, to
' lie in social relationship. They will, therefore, no longer tell a hostess
that they had “a perfectly splendid time” if the party was flat; they
will hot tell another girl that her dress is “wonderful” if they think it
isn’t; they will not tell a gift giver that a present is “scrumptious”—
they will look gift horses in the mouth.
So Wellesley thinks. So many have thought.
But all change their minds.
Conventional proprieties are not logical. They are extraordinarily
wrong theoretically; but they seem mysteriously . right practically.
They are part of the great society code of convention (which includes
much scorned; by our modern youth, so that the modern youth is
frowned upon by conventionalists). No solons could evolve such a
marvelous, code as this that society has built up for itself. The lies,
may be lies/and therefore/ wrong,' Biit~ they-prevent embafrassment,’
mad feelings, ended friendships, and gain little. It is a code of lies,
error, hypocricy, all wrong; but, perhaps, all right.
Maybe the way out of the difficulty is to be mum-—but if the
hostess asks, “Did you have a good time?”—what then?
NO PLACE FOR PACIFISM
At Northwestern University the more active members of the student
body have just finished pelting with such effective missiles as eggs and
tomatoes, a . group of pacifists who sought to enlarge their membership
by enlisting men who could pledge themselves never to take up arms in
the defense of .their country. .
This is not surprising. The surprising thing about it is that some
thirty men were willing to take such a pledge, and that nothing more
damaging than eggs and tomatoes was used in the pelting.
- Thirty men in a middle west university solemnly promising never
to take, up arms EVEN IF THE COUNTRY WERE INVADED!
That presents, a problem. Have these men turned a . deaf ear to the
principles of loyalty and patroitism for which American universities
stand? Have they forgotten the war record, of mid-west college men?
Have they forgotten the Unknown Soldier at rest in our Capitol? Have
they forgotten the rows upon rows of white crosses in that foreign
land? Are they prepared to “break faith with those who sleep in
. • Flanders’ fields”? : : : z
If they are they have no place in a mid-west university. /
HE STOOD AT THE PHONE
If one could be pardoned for stealing the style that Ben Hecht
employed in his “Thousand and One Afternoons in Chicago,” a repre-
sentative sketch depicting the phone habits of some four hundred
Notre Dame students (mostly freshmen) might run as follows: .
He stood at the phone.. He was utterly oblivious to everything ex-
cept the voice at the other end of the wire—and his own voice. Outside,
were six other men who had calls to make. He stood at the phone.
He was saying; “Aw, you really don’t mean that now, do you? . ... say,
I said ‘Hello’, to ‘Puffy’ for you/ . . , say, I bet you can’t guess who 1
■ saw last month .... say, dp you smell my breath, I’ve been eating
• onions, ha, ha ; . . . say, I saw a good show last . . . . ”
Outside there were eight men who wanted to make calls. Three
of them shufflled back and forth close to the booth and peered in mean-
ingly. Some one banged the door of the booth. The rest moved im-
patjently.. But he stood at the phone. He was saying, “Aw, you don’t
meant that now, do you? . . ; . Say, I bet you can’t guess who I saw
last week . . \ say, can you see the black eye I got, ha, ha . . . . say, I
read a swell book last ... . ”	.	/
/ Outside were ten other men, all waiting to - make calls. But he
- / stood at the phone. And he was saying, “Aw..say .... bet. . ... . .
. 5say .'. . . aw . . . ?*' ,. -	\	'!
And he stood (at the phone. .	'	-
“Frenzied Fiction,” but rather rests
on the same plane with “Behind the
Beyond.”
The volume is divided into two
sections. The first is devoted to
topics more or less theatrical; the
second, with a variety of subjects
ranging from “My Affairs With My
Landlord” to “Why I Refuse to
Play Golf.” Speaking ex cathreda,
one might presume, of “Radio. A
New Form of Trouble,” Leacock,
says:
set that it is no use telling me by
means of Radio, I would be able
seated comfortably in my own arm-
chair, to hear the Pittsburgh or-
chestra. I know it. I don’t want
to . Nor need he inform me that,
seated comfortably in my own arm-
chair I can hear a speech of W. J.
Bayan. I don’t need to. I heard
one.”
After getting this sledge hammer
subtlety off his chest Leacock im-
proves. The rest of the Radio arti-
cle is good and gets beter as it
goes along.
Any humorist, particularly one
of Leacock’s type, “goes stale” at
some stage of his career. This is
to be expected and while “Over
The Footlights” is good in spots,
there are places where this ten-
dency to “go stale” certainly ex-
hibits itself. It usually proceeds
the publication of a particularly
good volume so Leacock’s next book
should be a delight.
—o—
For. those particularly interested
in that form of literature that is
becoming so especially popular—
the essay, Joseph F. Wicham, of
the College of New York City, has
personally published an interesting
volume under the title, “The Eng-
lish Essay.” The volume consists
mostly of pertinent and personal
bits of comment upon this form of
writing.	/

What Others Say
The So-Called College Man
City editors and" budding novel-
ists have always evidenced a pecu-
liar interest in the college youth.
They/ have, in .their. ..inspection,, of
under-graduate life, looked for the
colorful and the bizarre; and they
have recorded, in their metropolitan
dailies and first novels the'intrigu-
ing rather than the normal, the
sensational rather than the repre-
sentative. And from their often
distorted accounts of essentially ir-
relevant university activities, there
has grown up in each generation a
conception of undergraduate life
which is curious in the extreme.
Three decades ago, in the bull1’
dog, pipe-and-sw^ater, . Stover-atr
Yale, period, the 'beaux ideal of col-
legiate literature was the brawny^
ingenious youth who rated wonder-
ful in foot ball, great in track, fair
in baseball, and from there down
in Latin, history and math; the
earnest young man who regarded
policemen and cabbies as his sper
cial victims and who came to col-
lege with the sincere purpose of
never being caught. This was your
dad and mine. ■■■•■'/
Of late, aping Fitzgerald more
than Fitzgerald ever aped life, re-
write men have treated the under-
graduate as a smooth-haired, im-
practical, mildly ineffectual person
interested chiefly ni football, minor
poets, women and gin. Now from
William Allen White and the Em-
poria, Kansas, Gazette comes a new
interpretation of the University
man. He is, (according to the well
known editor, a brass-lunged, lea?
ther-necked snob, “and there is
more in the same key.” ■ >
Perhaps this bit of copy will in-
augurate a new epoch, perhaps the
editorial conception of college life
is due. for a change. But the
change, while welcome, will not
bring the college man of fiction;
journalism or otherwise, nearer
actually. He will remain in the
same category as the musical com-
edy Englishman and the' Portfolio
professor, an amusing phenomenon.'

Don’t Wail About It
Write About It
This is your column
The DAILY does - not stand: responsible
[or any opinions or facts printed in this
department. No anonymous lettters can
be published; the writer’s initials at least
must be signed.
Editor of the DAILY:
It seems to me that the editorial,
"The Color Line,” in today’s issue
, of the DAILY is unnecessarily
•hard in its condemnation of Engene i
• O’Neill’s play, “All God’s Chillun
Got Wings.” This play is not a
story to be presented and viewed
as an end'in itself. It contains a
powerful lesson, a lesson which
seems to be needed in the North.
That lesson is: Social contact of
any nature, between white and
black has but one consummation,
and that is humiliation, degradation
and ruin to both races. Insofar as
this truth is inculcated, the play
will accomplish a worthy purpose.
Sincerely,
M. E. PEPPERMAN.
this letter when he wrote his essay,
"The Student Life,” and perhaps
slightly more authoritive on the
point in question than G. K. or R.
E. F., has this to say to the stu-
dent:
“Mix as much as you possibly
can with the outside world, and
learn its ways. ... The.outside so-
cial circle will enable you to con-
quer . the diffidence so apt to go
with bookishness and, which may
prove a very serious drawback in
after-life. I cannot too strongly
impress upon the earnest and at-
tentive men among you the neces-
sity of overcoming this unfortu-
natei failing in your student days.”
The time spent in lounging, if
used to good advantage, will se-
cure the contact with life that Sir
William advised. The problem is,
as he pointed out, to seek . the “hap-
py medium” between bookishness I
and laziness.	I

The Academic Council has ap-

extension of both wings and the
work will, be completed by Septem-

According to the specifications,
the extensions will provide space
for twelve new classrooms and a
new laboratory. The classrooms
will be for the exclusive use of the
mathematic and science depart-
ments. The laboratory will be for
the use of science students.

Editor of the DAILY:
There are times when the very
' tendons of endurance are pulled to
a breaking point. A man’s life may
be ruined by some little, negligible
lack of something that he might as
Well have and does not...
That is precisely what occurs in
the case^of mail boxes in the vari-
ous halls. I think I speak for Soph-
omore and Freshman halls when I
say that the students feel a strong
need of a box, located conveniently
in the hall, where they can post
outgoing letters, much the same as
j is provided in Brownson of the
| Main building. .	,,
It is wasted energy for the num-
bers of students in isolated halls to
tramp over the campus, mud and
all, to. the post office with one or
two letters, when the whole affair
could be so easily solved by a very
simple installation.
What is holding back this much-
damored-for improvement?

. Editor, NOTRE DAME DAILY:
The recent discussion in the cbr^
respondence column of the DAILY
।as to the advisability of lounging in
hotel lobbies has, to my mind, led
nowhere. G. K.’s first letter was
very general; it proved'nothing.
.Both R. E. F. and G. K. in their
subsequent letters, descend to per-
sonalities that have nothing to do
with the discussion and that should
have been omitted.	'
Both do, however, in the course
of their rantings, voice sound opin-
ions. G. K. is right, I think, when
he declares that no student should
“waste several hours a day” in ho-
tel, lobbies. The question is: Does
\he really waste those hours? ■_ R. E.

pressed hard near the end by Val-

stars of the conference.
“ Harrington joined the* ranks of
the monogram wearers yesterday
afternoon when he beat the Wiscon-
sin stars in the pole vault with a
leap of 12 feet. Both Jones and
Hammann were expected to be the
features of the pole vault, but
neither man .was able to place. j
Layden and Barr took a huge
slice of vthe points in the 40-yard
dash for the Blue and Gold. The
Irish runners finished the sprint al-
most on a dead line. McAndrews,
who won the dash against Iowa one
week ago yesterday, was relegated
to third place.
Irish Lose on High Jump
The Badgers made theii’ biggest
scoops in the 40-yard high hurdles
and the high jump. Johnny John-
son suffered a piece of hard luck
in the hurdle race when he upset
two of the timbers, after he had
gained the lead at the start of the
race. . .7 . '
Notre Dame was unable to pre-
sent a class of high jumpers' quite
the equal of the Badgers, although
the Cardinals did not win the event
with any remarkable jump. The
winnipg height was 5 feet, 10
inches.
Relay Decides Meet
, At the start of the relay race,
the score stood four points in Notre
, Dame’s favor and the, excitement
reached its highest pitch as the
mile relay runners toed the mark
for the race that was to decide the
meet.. McTiernan, led off for Notre
Dame and ran a hard race with-
Flueck, the .Badger, baton leader.
For over two laps the Irish star
was forced to' trail but edged into

the baton in number two position,
ran another -.quarter as difficult as
the one proceeding. Hamling
bested his man on the last lap and
gave Barr several yards’ lead on
the third quarter, which the Irish
flash used to good advantage. From
then on the. Blue and Gold were
never headed and Barr passed the
baton to Eaton a good ten yards
ahead of.Kennedy of the Badgers
who ran a desperate race in a.futile
attempt to overtake Barr. Eaton
with a comfortable lead kept. Notre

record-breaking time of 3:29 4-5. i
, Kennedy Makes Great Run
The victory was almost a surprise
for Notre Dame, who estimated the
strength of the Badgers far above
that of the, Irish., The splendid
time made in every event marked
the last indoor meet of the 1924
season as one of the best ever wit-
nessed on the local course.
Captain Kennedy, making his last
indoor appearance of his college ca-
reer, ran the greatest race of his
life. For fourteen years the mile
mark has lain on the . record books
of the University and of all the
brilliant milers who have appeared
here within that time, not one of.
them succeeded iri accomplishing
the feat which Kennedy was cred-
ited with yesterday afternoon.
