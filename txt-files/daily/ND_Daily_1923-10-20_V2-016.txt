7y/ BEING COLLEGE
“The freshman class is worse this year, than it ever was.”.
So have said the men here in 1923; so haVe said the men here in
1922, in-1921, 1920, 1919, and, perhaps, even back in 1843.	,
Freshman classes are peculiar; they are always the worst, and sb
one wonders how,-with the accumulated wickedness of years, that
freshmen can be so monstrously corrupt—arid1 live.	J
•; Freshmen are necessary . evils.. They,rare always criticised, they
are never. commended, but they^should be criticised ?for they deserve
criticism, arid they should never :becommended, for. they never, merit
commendation. . ;	■ - b i	/.; :	‘	/
’ 'The freshinen of this year are*the usual freshmen.’: They are little
creatures fresh from3 high or preparatory' school,- with' inbvirig picture
or’fictional ideas (of college and college; pranks, arid: they; are puffed
• with .admiration of, their own “college”: selves. ’	’ / ■
But. freshmen,are riot college-men., .Blustering, braggirig, because
a pretty girl is near, about how “I;pulled it-over on the, prefect’,’;/footr
ball games on street cars; pulling street car trolleys; :blatant displays
of .intellection; are not the marks of-a college, man. i! •
r ;; The real- Notre Dame man; does not wave a frantic hand>in class
to tell the; dear teacher that he,-he bf; all men,’ knows the ariswer.
Notre Dame; frowns upon false modesty; .-but it. has found ,’in ’the 81
years of its existence, that a certaini’amount of .modesty is/properly to
be -expected , in every ’ true gentleman. ' Hence, there has . grown iip the
.custom at Notre Dairie——scarcely a :cpnscious orie and obvious.to every-
one—there has grbkn, up: the,/ cpstdm of, never;..flaimtxng./what little
. knowledge, one; has,; especially when that .display might/ discredit soirie-
onei else. / In high- school-freshmen: might fight togive an -answer, but
at/Notre: Dame/learning-in /the < head 4s.-much; better .than learning
blustered forth from eager lips./7-■	? ; • ;i.. /' .	-

respectful to.ladies; he does not call.attention to himself.’. He rememT
hers that;he has no reason for offensive pride, that .he has no.reason to
call vulgar, attention to the fact; that he is in college—for. he is but one
of mariy,: many thousand college men.	: /I/t/:/ ' r i’,/ /

Hooda ...
Someone had called Hooda a four
flusher. Hooda had thanked him
and then hurried to the public li-
brary. He tame but in a rage. No
one could hand him anything. He’d
show him he wasn’t half as dumb
as he looked, nd! nor a fourth as
dumb) or a tenth 17 He would seek
him out and huihiliate him.
; Stopping a friend, he told him
what .had happened, “I am going to
seek him-'out arid humiliate him,”
said Hooda. “I am going to prove
to him that I’m not as dumb as I
look.” :	• Si -"J
• “You’ll’have’ a hard time doing
it,” said the friend. ■ “A very hard
time; he has gone;/ I just saw him
leave to board a train.” / ‘
Board a train. More devilnierit,
thought Hooda. ■ “Where and how
does- he do this?” he asked, dis-
guising the surge of his white-hot
passion under - a mask of complete
dumbness.
“The train leaves in one hour,”
replied the friend. “He will be
waiting for it at the N. Y. C. sta-
tion. The train will' come in and

[South Bend Tribune]
. NEW YORK, Oct. 18.—Prince?
ton isn’t given any more chance to
win than Luis Firpo was. And
Princeton is just as liable. to play
hob with the expert opinions as did
that sariie Firpo. Why? Well, be-
cause Princeton’s Princeton, we
suppose. Anyone seeking further
light on /he subject is respectfully,
asked to' talk over with Alonzo
Stagg, Bob Fisher or Tad Jones.
Any one of the three.should know.
Of the team that swept all before
it last year, in a manner that defied
analysis, Baker and Treat, two of
the greatest tackles in the country,;
are gone. Gray, a stellar end, is
go$e> too, but Smith,, who drop-
kicks with neatness, and Stout are
back, and Drews, a veteran on the
squad, is hailed as a strong substi-
tute for either. Alford is gone
from center but in his place is Cald-
well, who was a back last year.
Caldwell is hurt just now, arid For-
est, a freshman of last year, is do-
ing the work. , '
From the backfield that supplied
the “kick” to the Tiger party last
season only . Cleves seems to be
missing.- Dinsmore, Wingate. and
Gorman, the quarters, are on the
job. So are the other backs, Crum
and Beattie, with Croft, a newcom-
er, bidding. to take a regular job
away from the others..	7
Vanderbig Gibson and Legendre
are showing enough ability to make
the Princeton crowd wonder why
all the feeling of sorrow for-their
causes. ■ . /;
“It will not be the first time the
Tiger crossed the world,” is the tip
from the Princeton war office.
“Arid it will not be the last. Ifz
you want to feel sorry for' some-
body, feel sorry for the' Giants. We -
haven’t'Tieen licked yet.” /	/?

The Army mule led the West
Point Cadets in a parade around
Ebbetts field, Brooklyn, yesterday
before the start of the Notre Dame-
Army game, but once the game
started the Notre Dame goal line
was a given point past which no
Army man could parade. •	.
While the cadets played the* old
Army game and slogged along on
their feet, the Westerners took to
the air with all the speed and cer-
tain power of a ZR-1 and flew their
way to a 13 to 0 victory.
After trying a plunging attack
in the first quarter, Notre Dame dis-
covered that it. could not win if its
team fought it out on that Army
line for several summers.

By W. V. MORGENSTERN
On the face of Saturday’s foot-
ball results it would seem that the
Notre Dame team is to be the class
of the middle west this season.
Some of the air was taken out of
the claims of several conference
schools by the games played Satur-
day and it. is now a pertinent ques-
tion as to which of the Big Ten has
a really good team.	.
’Notre Dame evidently demon-
strated a marvelously versatile at-
tack against the Army. The one
flaw in Rockne’s content is that his
team is light but the attack that
he has developed keeps the opposi-
tion_spread' out ^nough .to make his
line attack successful. On defense
the Notre Dame boys seem quite
competent, for the Army team, in-
tact from last year, has already
proved its driving power in. straight
football.. Rockne’s forward pass-
ing, always brilliant,. seems better
protected than ever this year.

some flaws' with the Hoosiers’ de-
fensive play.	•	:
As practically every follower of
football knows, Notre Dame is
noted in gridiron circles for. its
ability to block and tackle. It is
tradition for the “Irish” eleven to
bring the ball carriers to the earth
with a thud, and it is a severe blot
on a Rockne player’s career if he
misses his man in the interference.
It was this ability to tackle and
block which had so much to do with
last week’s defeat of the Army,
while the alertness and cunning dis-
played by Rockne’s players in get-
ting out: in the; open to receive for-
ward passes and intercepting: tosses
of the cadets was one of the most
pleasing features of the game. •:•
The Notre Dame offense worked
like the tick of a clock. Only once
in the game was the team penalized
for tracks in motion. This is' ex-
ceptional in the - Hoosiers’' style of
play, which demands backfield
shifts behind unbalanced lines; In
making the shift the -players now
step to either side instead of hop-
ping, as in former years. • In taking
their steps to either side the player's
count slowly, so that all move in
unison and comes to such a stop that
all momentum is lost when the last
step is taken.	•
At-times the .Notr.e_..Dame, for-
wards were slightly outchargedj.
and it was during-these lulls that
the Army made its terrific.smashes
through holes between the two
tackles. As a whole, however,-the
Hoosier line did- mighty well, con-

sidering it was outweighed'and the
Army forwards were more exper-
ienced. .	:
While Notre Dame won the game,
a lot ■ ;of credit is due to Knute
Rockne, one of'the most competent
coaches in the country. The for-
ward pass attack used by Rockne’s
men was something quite new in
football, and opens a new field of
possibilities. Line plunges were
used as decoys to draw in the Army
secondary defense and then the
overhead attack was employed. The
masterful attack of Notre Dame
showed Rockne to be a real tactic-
ian.
Generally speaking, Notre Dame
gave a wonderful exhibition of
football, but the big question now
is whether they Can repeat against
Princeton on Saturday. It is
mighty hard to keep a team keyed
up to the mental state of Notre
Dame last Saturday. In addition,
Stuhldreher and Layden were in-
jured and may not start against the
Tigers.	•	_

The writer believes . the South

steam taken out of it last’ Saturday
in the'victorious clash with Army.
But Notre Dame still is a whirl-
wind, and any team is in grave dan-
ger once she gets within their. 25
yard line. Only the greatest alert-
ness in line and secondary defehse
can prevent a touchdown if they
get that far. '	.
Notre Dame has a variety of
plays, depending largely upon back-
field shifts, any one of which may
eventuate in an attack at any point
in. the liner or in a forward pass.
