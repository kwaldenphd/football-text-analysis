|GAME IS SPEEDY
Carroll Maintains First Place in
Interhall Basketball Standing;
Sorin and Badin Win.
There were no marked changes
made in the interhall basketball
standing when four of the sched-
uled games were played in the gym
Sunday. Carroll remained on top,
with Day and Sorin in second and
third places. Badin pushed Cadil-
lac into fifth place, with Brownson,
Freshman, Sophomore, Corby and
Walsh trailing behind.
The fastest game on the schedule
Sunday was the battle between
Freshman and Corby, the Frosh
tossers carrying off the big end of
a 25 to 19 score. Getting off to a
speedy, start, Freshman held the
lead throughout. With the Frosh
leading 15. to 8 at the start of the
last period, Corby outplayed its op-
ponents, ~but the lead-was too~great
to. overcome. DeVault and Lukats

Gov. Walsh, as King of the
“hard-timers,” with power to im-

performed in nice style for the
Frosh, while Crowley arid Collins
were the outstanding’ players for
Corby.
Cadillac failed to play up to its
former showings, and was handed
a ;i6-to-ll defeat by Sorin.' Dur-
ing the first half the Cadillac crew
had the. better of the engagement,
but a. series of baskets by Sorin
toward the end of the game de-
cided the contest. Cronin and
Conley starred for Cadillac. Swift
was high point man for Sorin.
The leading Carroll team, un-
folding the same -brilliant attack
that has. factored in its former vic-
tories, proved too much for the
Walsh team, and the interhall
leaders came out on the top of a
25. to 11 score. The Carroll ring-
ers had the game from the start
and were never seriously pressed.
Cullinan and Navarre played nice-
ly’for .Walsh’. There were no out-
standing stars for .Carroll, the en-
tire team showing good form.

Mary Jo Miller, who wore a gown
chiefly of red and green canvas,
and Miss Mary Howard, were
awarded N. D. pillow tops. The
costume worn by Charles Springer
was adjudged the least likely to
withstand the ravages of the cara-
cole, and he. received—the—man!s ~
prize, an N. D. watch-fob.
The “booby” prize for the.men
was presented to “Miss” Frances
Crowley, of Corby Hall. Miss
Helen Vincent received a wash-
board and two cakes of soap as a
similiar distinction.
DEAN KONOP HURT
T. F. Konop, dean of the Univer-
sity Law school, is reported to have
suffered injuries to his knee in a
fall on a slippery pavement in
South Bend Sunday. The accident
occurred immediately after Dean

Foresters. He was able to take his
place in the refectory last night.

BOK’S BUNCOMBE
- Politicians we have with us always. And like the ever-vigilant
mother who watches over her family of little ones, the politician is con-
. stantly on the alert to protect and promote the interests of his party.
Some weeks ago when Mr. Bok announced that his Peace Award
jury had selected the winning plan, he was only acting in accordance
with a group of politicians who, we are told, had helped him concoct the
“peace” scheme as a propaganda forerunner of a political campaign.
These politicians are the same ones-who four years ago were buried
beneath the debris of the republican landslide, and. who are now pre-
paring for a jubilant comeback.should their idealistic interpretation
of internationalism.be generally accepted. They have declared this
JBok peace plan to be the panacea for the ills of the world,-and now
they are trying to assure the Americans that if the United States gov-
ernment adopts the plan as outlined, the horrible, bloddy, and destruc-
tive wars of the past will be unknown to future generations. They are
trying to paint a beautiful contrast favoring conditions as they will
be in the.future.,should7the plan be adhered, to, but they; are. mixing
their paints on an?old-palet that- has been smeared with the colorful
designs of-pro-leaguers.
On the, face of it the plan seems desirable because, first of all, it
embodies a formula for bettering some social. conditions' in Europe,
even though they are being tended to without the plan having been put
into practice, and secondly, because of its very idealistic nature; yet its
framework is nothing more or less/.thanan argument for entering the
League .of Nations and a proposal by means of which we can become a
part of / that system without formally aligning: ourselves with it as
provided in the, Treaty of Versailles. It is therefore undesirable be-
cause we know from experience that European; and American opinions
do not. coincide. Those European nations always seem to find it diffi-
cult to remain at peace with one another even long enough to agree to
agree.’ How much more difficult would it not be for us, then, to hold
them in check when we naturally would try to disagree with their
disagreements.- }	.	.	. ..	'
In reality these politicians are championing a plan Svhich they
know is purely buncombe from a practical point of view, but it is one
which sounds rather plausible, and it may win for Them the majority
of the votes in the coming November elections.
OURSHOWS
. Lecturing is sometimes weakened because the one who is being
lectured becomes biased against being scolded. A few statements of
pufeMact and truth often accomplish more than any amount of scold-
ing. Therefore, a few facts may Enlighten those (their number is
small), who criticize the Washington Hall movies.
All of South Bend’s show, houses are protected against any up-to-
the-minute picture being obtained by. others; except when these others
pay. the regular graduated price for the picture. . These'pictures come
in “blocks” of twelve or more, and one show house will usually speak
for three or four of them. It does, not take a genius to see that.finan-
cially it is impossible for Notre Dame to break in on this plan. Fur-
thermore, the show houses are protected both before and after they
have shown a picture. Now if the pictures get out to Washington Hall
late there is. an objection because they have been seen down town and
are “old stuff”; it therefore becomes a problem, to ;select features that
have not been seen by the majority’of students.	.	.
These are the facts. No effort has been spared to please the stu-
dent body in this matter and as a result the-comedies have been very
good and the features..have been as a whole- not7 at all second-rate.
If anyone has a . scheme whereby- Notre Dame can obtain up-to-the-
minute pictures with the-facility that South-Bend show houses "et them
they have solved a problem. Think thisfover’before you criticise!
Many a modern girl would be insulted if someone told her he
thought she was dressed sensibly.	....... ■ ■"■

published by the official publication

nounced that beginning with :.that

first move of the publication to

ing, craffty - politician.. “Dope”
stories- containing the actual politi-
cal happenings of the campus /will

There is no end to bases of divi-
sion when the subject to be divided
is the human race. If it is true
that no two faces are quite alike—
and what a blessing that it is—it is
also the lesson of experience that
no two minds or hearts are totally
similar. If they were, then surely
we should have universal peace,—
and also, possibly, universal stag-
nation. We all long for peace, and
yet it seems that none of us really
wants it. The next most interest-
ing thing in life to a real unfeigned
fight is a fictitious one. “Staging”
battles, conflicts, combats, is the
life-blood of fiction.’ Still a feud
is more thrilling, than a farce. It
is: also more fatal—but that is an-
other question.	•
There seems to be a blessing
hidden behind most of the things
we label, undesirable 'or proclaim
evil. Besides, we pretend an aver-
sion to many things pretty much as
Caesar put aside the proffered
crown. Bad manners are dreadful.
But they are also amusing when one
is; in the right humor. Everybody
enjoys a bull in a china shop, so
long :as the shop is not his own.
And a “horse” laugh creates real
merriment in a hay-mow. We know
next to nothing about the .Einstein
theory of Relativity, but we have
notions on relativity, foi’ all that.
It. is said that “for those who
think, the world is a comedy, for
those who feel, it is a tragedy.”
If that is true, it proves that life
must be a serio-tragic affair for all.
For, in our judgment, no individual
passes through life without at some
rare moment becoming guilty of
thought, and feeling cannot but ac-
company thought. .	.
But it. is not true. For many
take the world seriously precisely
because they do think. The more
deeply they think the more serious

their outlook on life. The greatest
thinkers of the centuries have
been the saints, and they have been
the most serious of men, and also
men of the keenest sensibilities.
There may be inveterate grouches,
but. there are no constant comedi-
ans. In fact, really comical per-
sons wear an habitual air of seri-
ousness.
Truth is imperilled when the
members of one’s classification are
not mutually exclusive, To divide
men into thinkers and feelers is a
case in point. Thought unaccomr
panied by feeling may be grapha-
phonic; it is not human.. Feeling
uninitiated by thought may be sens-
ible; it is not rational. All men
think and all men feel, though in
different degrees of perfection.
Disorder creeps in and harm is
done, as well when the thinker vio-
lently stifles his feelings as when
his feelings are allowed to domin-
ate the thoughts. And of the two
extremes, the latter is by far the
more disastrous.	:
The world becomes a- comedy for
those thinkers only who attempt to
reduce it to the;size of their idea
of it. When Schopenhauer said:
“The world is my idea,” he made
it a comedy, because in sb doing he
first . made himself a comedian.
Hence though thinkers refuse to
take him seriously, they need .not,
therefore, also regard the universe
as a joke. The world becomes a
tragedy to those who.have such an
exaggerated' notion of their own
importance as to believe that they
deserve a. better one. They re-
gard themselves as so much better
than . the universe and all that is
in it that, by comparison with the
face in the mirror, it presents a
sorry sight. The comedians need
to look into the mirror; the trage-
dians need to paint it over with
soap.	-	.

A puzzling book indeed. In one

Well, Joe thought the show was
good, Bert called it meiocre, and
we considered it pretty fair. All
All
were unanimous on one point, how-
ever, when we agreed that Owen
McGiveney shone forth as conspic-
uously as the proverbial good deed
in a-naughty world. - This one-man
dramatic club plays a scene from
“Oliver Twist” in a manner that is
almost incredible. There is simply
nothing to this act but McGiveney.
Dotson is a terpsichorean artist
of Harry Wills’ hue, and to say
that die can dance’is to put ib mild-
ly, s This act contains • some good
comedy, and many examples of

Standing apart from the larger
and more magnificent buildings on
the'campus is the little Notre Dame
Observatory. It is scarcely notice-
able for its size; yet greatly sifini-
ficant in the history and tradition
of the University of Notre Dame.
In 1860, Napoleon III presented
Father Sorin with a magnificent
telescope, ground under the person-
al supervision of Leon Focault, the
greatest physicist of his time. This
instrument -was constructed of
wood with the lenses balanced on
a tsipod. The old observatory was
located to the left of the present
Main building. It was destroyed by
fire in 1879 but the telescope was
saved. The same year the lenses
were removed and placed in a .new
mounting. The old frame was dis-
carded and placed in the old boat-
house on St. Joseph’s Lake where
it may still be found. The present
building was completed in 1890.
■ The original objective lens was
planitary bodies and double stars.
It is also provided with a solar at-
tachment which makes it possible
for one to study the sun spots and
like phenomena. The machine is
exceptionally good, and enables
one to get a very definite and pre-
cise idea of the various markings
of the planets.
The rotating roof of the observ-
atory also has a historic setting. It
revolves on ball bearings which are
cannon balls picked up on the bat-,
tie field of Tippacanoe. For his

kies can do if he really tries.
Miller and Mack start off by
reground in order to give the tele-
scope a longer focal length. This
lens is six inches in diameter with
a magnificent range of from 40 to
400 diameters. The instrument is
equipped with a micrometer 'for

threatening to be very funny, but ■	y'
contribution, Napoleon III has been
listed among the benefactors of the
University and his portrait may
now be found among the mural
decorations of the Main building.
Due to the various improvements,
the telescope is modern in all re-
spects and is a miniature model of
the great Yerkes Observatory.
Throughout the year, when the
weather permits, daily, observations
are made by Father DeWolf, who
is in charge. Students are invited
to come in and take a peek at the
moon on any night that Father. De-
Wolf is around. Recently Father
DeWolf started an astronomy class
for those particularly interested in
this kind of study..

Professional jugglers could handle the old-
style shaving cream caps and never once drop
one down-the drain or under the bath tub.
But for most of us, this new Williams Hinge-
Cap puts an end to an ancient nuisance.
Williams Shaving Cream is just as much
pleasanter to use as is the Hinge-Cap. It
softens the beard with uncanny speed. The
thicker lather holds the moisture in against
the skin where it is needed. ’ This lather lu-
bricates the skin, too, so that painful razor
friction is eliminated.. And when your shave
is done, that famous ingredient in Williams
which helps the skin, leaves your face cool, 1
soothed and refreshed. No coloring matter
is used in Williams — it is a pure, natural-
white shaving cream.
