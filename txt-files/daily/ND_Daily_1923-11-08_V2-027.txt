Tells Them That the Library Is
Theirs; Explains System
of Library. .
“The. library is the most useful
tool of education,” the: Rev. P. J.
Foik, director of the Library, told
the Freshman class in their , weekly
lecture, given»at .12:40 o'clock yes-
terday afternoon in. Washirigton
hall. “When one has mastered the
pdethods of finding the' information
he wants in books,” he' continued,
’“he becoines the. possessor of a key
that will unlock doors to: unlimited
treasures.” .. , . .	- .
The benefits of the University
Library were enumerated by Father
Foik in his lecture on: “How to Use
the Library.” The manner , in which
one may get, books containing, the
inforihation for xvhich he is looking,
was described in detail. . ;
“The confining of one’s learning
only to'the text book and the class
room tends to; the slavery, of reason
and the impoverishment of
thought,” Father Foik; said. ‘He
laid particular stress, on the acquir-
ing of much knowledge through
frequent; visits to .the library. '
' Announcement was made that be-
cause of a conflict in several classes,
all .convocations in the. future will
be . held on Thursday. and not on
Wednesday as in the past. .

“FAMILIARITY BREEDS CONTEMPT”
A- school with an. inspiring song,..one that expresses .the peculiar
spirit of that school, possesses something that neither law nor money
can take from it. It is a heritage richer than gold, more powerful than
power.' No historian has. told us how great a- part “The Marseillaise’’
played, in .the overthrow oL the,French monarchs, blit it is: our guess
that without the martial, emotional song, many-a shop keeper who cried
for blood with the mob, would have watched with passive eye the crowd
surging past his door.
Our. “Victory March,” in its confident, buoyant, words and its ring-'
ing melody, embodies the very soul of'Notre Dame. It has spurred to
victory half-beaten teams; it has stimulated weary minds with the elixir
of noble feelings; it has been hallowed-by years of tradition. It is only
fitting, therefore, that this song, as sacred to Notre Dame as the great
dome, be reserved for spirited occasions. ‘	;;	■	.->■
Let it not'ride the dips of coal-haulers in company with such songs
as “Smiles.” It is our song, and the moment it1 becomes common prop-:
erty it ceases to belong to us. Let it not become the old standby of
downtown orchestras; they, by the; way, have been prominent. in vio-
lating its sancity. “When in doubt, play the,.‘Victory March’,” seems
to guide their choice of selections.
' - -Last Saturday night we saw a sight we have never seen before,'
and hope we inay never see again—Notre Dame men sitting and eating
while the', “Victory March” was being played; You- would blame- the
men? Somewhat—yet the greatest blame falls; on the orchestra that
will play the song, play it- and. replay it, as though it were-the only,
piece they knew. One enjoys standing to sing the: “Victory March,”
when the impulse is spontaneous,/and the occasion appropriate. But
one is scarcely inclined to rise and sing with spontaneity after each and
every course of a nine-course, dinner? 1 \	1	.
....— -.Advice-tb-thosC who would drag/in’the “Victory March” topwork up
the spirit/of (every: audience, whether it be gathered to, hear. a. lecture
. on bacteriology or to see a-high school coach.be; given a watch charm:
Be origirial-7-use bombs, or toy pistols, or serve West-side winey if-you
must stir 'tip’ spirit; Don’t wear the, “Victory;; March” threadbare.
ReServe it more and repeat it less; '	■ : ’ . <	• /

The picture is good. Little more
can be- said of any picture: The

ery is appropriate, the story is in-
teresting—all in all, the production
js worthwhile, not one of the best
pictures of the year,’ but one of the
better ones. :
Conway Tearle takes the part of
an artist; rich and of prominent
family. Corinne Griffith is the girl,
without money and obliged to seek
employment as a'model. She be-
, comes-a- model for. the artist, and
the two fall in love.
' That was all well enough, except
that the rich and prominent'family
with’which the artist is connected
wants him to marry a girl of their,
own set .It seems as if the family
would have its way when the model:
is informed of the situation; and,
coached by. her employer’s sister,
refuses his proposal of marriage.
The result was that the two.
drifted apart and, until all seemed;
awry, there was no-reunion. And
then, marriage, forbidden, they
agreed to live together under the
Common Law. until ' -

16) Nov. 1.—To Hon. Don
Notre Dame football team,
(Suite
Miller,
South
Bend, Ind. My Dear Don: Well,
Don, I hope by this time that you
have fully recovered from your
cross-country runs of last Saturday
and that you will be in good shape
against Purdue. Don’t treat the
boys too rough, Don, and don’t run
yourself to death.
Well, Don, I and Slickem got
home safely from South Bend and
are preparing now tb journey to
Columbus, Ga., for the Georgia-
Auburn game. Life is'just one trip
after another for I and Slickem.
■ Well, Don, today I received the
following wire from Mike McTigue,
light-heavyweight boxing champion.
“Please get two seats for the game
at Columbus for I and Joe Jacobs,
my manager.” I have reserved the
seats, Don; but I have not paid for
them, as I am afraid Mike may
change his mind at the last minute
and leave me with-the bag to hold.
- The -Tech team returned from
your home, Don, without , any seri-
ous injuries. One thing I admire
about you, Don, is that when you
run with the ball you don’t give
nobody an opportunity to get hurt.
L remember after bne of your long
runs for a touchdown Saturday I
saw you bust out crying as though
your heart would break. .
- “What is the-'matter .with. Don?”
I asked a Notre Dame man.
J- “A Tech man-touched-him_on_the.
■arm . while ; en-; route to , the goal
line,” the man replied. “He don’t
like for nobody to touch him/*. He
feels his’ runs for touchdowns -hav£

ball ppblic of the east that Rockne
has a team with championship pos-
sibilities.
It was not forward passing or
trick stuff that won for Notre Dame
this afternoon. It was, for the
most part, good, old-fashioned foot-
ball. Thrusts off tackle and end
runs gained ground almost as the
westerners desired in the early part
of the game. Rockne’s pupils saw
soon after the first kick-off that it
would be a pleasant romp for them.
They were cool, deliberate and used
their brains as well as their brawn.
Rockne’s pupils knew how to de-
fend against passes. Roper used
that wide-spread formation. Rockne
used the man-to-man defense. As
the eligible receivers ran out to
await the passing of the ball, Notre
Dame men covered each one, point-
ing a finger at the many they were
to cover as if to say “I’ve got you,
old top.” Soon a Tiger pass was
caught by an opponent. Then No-
tre Dame shoved the pass just
enough to get the bait within strik-
ing distance of the goal line.

NEBRASKAMEN
GETTING READY
Rockmen Practice for Game Satur-
day; Nebraska Points All Ef-
forts Toward Victory.
The. westerners will present
a
line-smashing and end-running game
and will perhaps heave a few passes.
At fullback the Nebraskr/ns will
have the * veteran Noble who has
performed against the Rockmen for
the past two years. His weight and
speed have made him a formidable
line plunger. The dependable Lew-
ellyn, another veteran on .the team,
will be at quarter back. He is an
ingenious general.
Rocknewill take three teams to
Lincoln to insure the team against
any disaster from sudden injuries
as welkas to take ample care of the
problem of inserting fresh men into
the game to relieve the tired play-
ers. ' "	.	- .' '
The Cornhuskers’ varsity eleven
scrimmaged with the freshman team
during the early part of the week,
and according to .reports, the year-
lings were unable to gain through
the varsity’s defense. The west-
erners have two pair of ends that
have made. a reputable showing in
the Missouri Valley conference foot-
ball ranks and were' prominent fac-
tors in the scrimmage in smother-:
ing the Notre Dame plays.
; - The Nebraskans are working on
offensive tactics hoping that if they,
can prepare a stout defense for their
. ball toters they will be able to reg-:
ister touchdowns against the visitors
from Indiana with ease.
•The following men will leave
South Bend at 2:50 this afternoon
for Lincoln: Collins, Crowe, Far-
rell, McMullan, Bach, Noppenberger,
Gluckert, Brown, .Weibel, Regan,
Walsh, Arndt,- Kizer, Vergara, Har-

ser, Crowley, Enright, Cerney, Liy-

With unanimous and unswerving
loyalty, the student body of the
University'of 'Nebraska are molding
themselves into.a;unit-that-has for
its aim the greatest objective that
can be realized in the sport life of
the Cornhuskers — “Beat Notre
Dame.” ’	. .
■ Campus, * class rooms and frat
■ houses are rio£ with discussion of
the approaching gridiron .battle'foe-
tween Nebraska and. Notre Dame.
Eds and co-eds alike have but one
thought to eat, sleep and live on. ■
v Student‘leaders in'the Nebraska
university -life are devoting their
entire attention to stirring up that
/fire of devotion that.has sent foot-.
, ball teams to victory against over-
whelming odds. They are striving
to awaken in the Nebraska follow^
ers- that spirit of never-die . in or-
der that when their aggregation of
pigskin chasers line up on the play-
ing field/against the nationally re-
nowned football machine from South
bend, .those red jerseyed lads .that
will fight for the honor of the Corn-
huskers will .have all possible loy-
alty behind-them to spur them on.
Again at Nebraska, the Rockmen
.will face a situation similar to that
in’the East, and their work on the
playing field next Saturday will be
an occasion for them to work at
their best, again to show the foot-
ball world that Notre Dame rates
several places on this. year’s team
of the hall of fame.
Rockne has been spending the few
days before leaving the Irish camp
in perfecting his offense, featured
by some new forms of attack and
developing his defense to the high-
est'point of solidarity. There will
be much need of defense since Ne-
braska, -like all othpr prominent
teams the Irish have encountered,
will far outweigh them.- It will be
another game from the neck up.
Since the Purdue encounter, the
Irish mentor has been working to
regenerate that pep and dash that
characterized his eastern invasion.
His method is being applied grad-
ually and by the time the starting
whistle sounds, the Notre Dame
football team, says Superlative
Samuel, “will be a cyclone garbed
in moleskins and ready to sweep
through the ranks of the red-jer-
seyed warriors on the wheat plains
of Nebraska.” -	.	1

BASKET BALL
WORK BEGINS
Coach Keogan Has Good Material
for Team; Practice at the
Y. M. C. A. Gym. ?
The basket ball season at Notre
Dame has started, with the call of
Coach Keogan for candidates. The
first meeting of the year was at-
tended by. 50 prospective court per-
formers and the practice sessions
scheduled -to be/ held at ..the
Y. M. C. A., where the wooden floor
will facilitate the quick development
of a winning team. ‘
Prospects for a' good- team -this
year- are better than before and
will be better after the football sea-
son is over, since the gridiron sport
keeps several basket ball men busy.
Captain ' Mayl, Kizer, Don Miller,
and Rex Enright, now working with
the football squad, were among the
high lights of the quintet.
Added to this number will be sev-
eral men, from last- season’s fresh-
man zteam, among whom is Clem
Crowe, football end and basket ball
player, and Reardon, Mahoney and
O’Boyle of the 1922 aggregation. /

Freshmen, would you like to help
Nebraska’s “fighting Cornhuskers”
defeat the “fightin’ ;Irish”.; from No-
tre Dame in the memorial- stadium
a week from Saturday?
Certainly you: would. Further-
more, you are going to have an op-
portunity. to help win the Notre
Dame’ contest, that “game of
games,” at which you will see the
greatest ' display of traditional
Husker fight ever exhibited at the
Cornhusker school.
How? By pledging one or more
units towards the' payment for the
new memorial stadium. '
“But how .will this help, to win
the Notre. Dame game?” ask the
freshmen. : Here is the explanation:
Nebraska’s football squad, under
the; direction of. Head ■ Coach Daw-
son, Coach Schulte and , assistants,
is ' out , on the. athletic field today,
tomorrow, and every day preparing
for . the contest with ;1 the Notre
Dame team, which is being hailed as
the “greatest football machine in
the country. The moleskin warriors
are grinding and drilling, making
every effort to be able to turn back
the Irish onslaught on the 1 Oth*;
The team is doing its part toward
the winning of the; Notre Dame
game, j ' -	•	'

team. Furthermore, the .team must
know that the student body is be-
hind ’ it. How can. the students
prove their loyalty to the team and
to the school?
The team and coaches know that
the upperclassmen and faculty are
loyal because they went over the
top . in the great stadium drive last
year.	-	■ ’	,
The upperclassmen and faculty
have done their part towards the
winning of the Notre Dame game.
Are the freshmen going to do
their part towards the winning of
the Notre Dame game?
They can do it in one way, and
in one way only, and that is by go-
ing over the.top “Freshman Week”
and pledging.not only the 1,127
units on the stadium alloted them
by the alumni association, but even
taking 1,400 or 1,500 units, thus
giving concrete proof of their loy-
alty to the teams and to the school.
Freshmen, the eyes of the foot-
ball team, the upperclassmen, and
the faculty are upon you. They
are hoping that the freshman will
show the traditional Husker fight
and loyalty to the Scarlet and
Cream by putting the “Freshman
Week” movement . across. The
school is challenging your Corn-
husker spirit.	-
Help. Nebraska win the Notre
Dame game!
