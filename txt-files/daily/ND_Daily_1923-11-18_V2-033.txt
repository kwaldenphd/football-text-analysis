Irish Win S late Title by Defeating Pat
Page’s Eleven; Stuhldreher and Layden
Star;Many Irish Play Last Home Game
/ .	, BY THOMAS COMAN.
They call them the Fighting Irish and they sure did fight yesterday
afternoon.when the Rockmen shattered the state title hopes of the Butler
College eleven 34. to 7,'on. Cartier field.
The game started out with all the old speed and fight seething in
the moleskin-clad warriors who were-making-their last appearance on
the home grounds for the 1923 season. And the longer the game lasted,
the more vicious grew the fight./. When Pat Page’s proteges from In-
dianapolis left the field at the final whistle, they? knew they had been
the witnesses of. just’ about everything in the football catalog, including
the" rules'.	'	" /	, !'
.The downstate aggregation had a good kicker/in Griggs. They
made some nice passes late in the game and they offered plenty of fight
and carried a few men on their squad who displayed some vicious tack-
ling. Outside of that, the . Pagemen . were , outclassed in every depart-
ment except the.-toe work.;//;/,./ \	//^ ...	.

Butlerites they" all looked like ~
“Red” Grange,’ whose "acquaintance
they made earlier in the season
’wheri Butter lost to Illinois 21 to 7;
;The Irish linerneri played-the -human
'steamroller- yesterday 'and: mowed
harvey' brown.
i - Capta/iri Harvey Brown played his
last ’ game Tor -Nbtre' Dame Ori Car-
tier field; when-the-Irish ran riot
over Butler, ,34 to-7,’ yesterday aft-
ernoon. ,
down' everything that the capital
city' warriors had to offer. ' .
: ? The/' Pagemen "' garnered -; seven
points-a few minutes after the gairie
operied, when ■ they ' blocked Hous-
er’s punt in'front of ’the Irish‘goal
arid, a- Butler man fell on' the- bail;
The, credit for.. a touchdown /. was
given to; the .visitors after a lengthy
discussion .by the .referees. ,;From
then on, Butler never, threatened
the Irish goal. ./ .-	,
i ’ Captain . Harvey .Brown .playing
his last game for,.Notre Drime, on
the home gridiron, was,/one .of the
stellar , performers in the Irish'-line/
and time -after time - smeared ' the
opposition’s' drives ’ at 1 the - line.'
Oberst- proved -more than; a match
for the heavy Hungate and several
times broke, thro ugh: the.line and
dumped the,[Butler ball- toiers for
a loss. Bach, Kizer . and Adam
Walsh and Regan were right bn the
frbrit: line every, minute / of the
game and enjoyed rib little success
in smothering the Butler backs -be-
fore; they got started.
; The Butler shift' failecLto.produce
any great , amount of yardage with
the exception of one ‘ or two plays;
In ■ the' last quarter, ’ the. shift cov-
ered -the' passer nicely- and several
pretty heaves were completed, but
had - no effect on.' the final score. -/
i ; .The Pagemen', had Three, riotable
performers ori their line .that drew
the praise of the. crowd .several
times during: each quarter. Wood-
ling at end, Reichel,1 center, ■ and
Duttenhaver ;in the :'right'’-guard
hole, proved' to ,be' the. only difficul-
ties that the Rockmeri had to con-
tend against in yesterday’s encoun-
ter. Duttenhaver was in ' every
play and was a sure and frequent
tackler. After breaking} through
the line, he would follow the Notre
Dame, interference and drop the
Irish runner. . .
Elmer . Layden, the /. Irish triple-
threat^ artist,, played one ' of the
most crashing games of his. bril-
liantfootball career. . His .line
plunging was the feature of
the'game. and nearly every time he
was i:called upon to lug the ' oval,
he jplowed through, the _ Butler de-. ,
fense - for/gains. of from ; eight to
■twenty-yards and then crawled a
fewf feet... after ; he was tackled.
Crowley-arid Miller continued their
speed performances,, with Miller
reeling off one of .the most spectac-
ular runs" of the game. Taking the
ball'in ihidfield, the most consistent
running back of the .season, raced
around the left end and eluded
tackler after tackler until he was’
finally' downed by; half a dozen.
Butlerites / on’ the visitors’ 20-yard
line.- It was a hard tackle and Mil-
ler was removed-from the game
badly shaken up. • ;
... “Red” Maher, who: went. in for
Miller, played his usual flashy game '
and showed the visitors a clean pair
of heels at several parts of the
field at once. ;	•
( Stuhldreher; who was acclaimed
in the East as the best “little” quar-
terback'that ever wore the mole- ’
skin, sprang a' surprise on the But-
ler team,, when he received Griggs’
punt on his own 20-yard line and
following. perfect, interference, the
diriunutive general raced along-the •
side lines for., a touchdown. The
work of Charley Collins was su-
preme oh this' run, when he neatly-
put two Butler men out of the play. •
Collins played a steady game all
afternoon and made several pretty.
.'tackles.	.
/ . Cerney, the Irish flash that made
the done touchdown against Ne-'
braska, .played havoc with the But-
ler line, tearing through the: center
for a big gain time after time.
. In the last quarter, “Rock” sent
in the backfield that started the
game, cbinposed of Cerney, Houser
and Connell. The entire period ‘
was riot with action, and Doc Con-
nell played one • of the most spec-
tacular games of - his life. There
was no one on the defense that
could stop him, even’after he was
downed. He was a steam roller all
by himself, i His off tackle smashes
were a,-revelation of speed and
strength as .lie hurtled his . body
along the ground and through the .
air. ’ •	’ • •	- . .
/Butler intercepted a pass to Con-
nell and the dpwnstate contingent
made a last bid to score by. un-
corking a pass attack, froiri their
peculiar -shift, but it was of no
avail. -■ • -u :	;

7.U If ?THE”NOTRE/DAME DAILY falls’ through this year,J the
failure will. present - thev most shameful and degrading spectacle which
Jias .ever disgraced, a . college: carnpus. This’editorial does not seek .a
. nielodramatic effect/thrduglrthe use. of melodramatic words but only to ■
present.unfortunate facts. Soiith Bend high school publishes a: monthly :
magazine; riumberless high schools throughout the country, have week-
lies .and many have dailies/but Notre Dame apparently cannot support
a: pajier; -’This editorial, purposes tb show that the fault lies with the
‘ six hundred students who refuse to support THE NOTRE DAME
D AILY, and if possible,, it purposes to bring such men to a realization
of their duty; ;	.	.
/ THE,DAILY,,like, any new-boim babe, is small-and unpretentious.
Unlike-a:baby, however, it seems.to fail to charm or to intrigue admira-
• ... tion .by the way. It wriggles itiripinkltoes./JEatker/W j:ecentlyJmla;;
speech; at . a student mass meeting, spoke’of the time when the Notre
. Dame footbalL team “pointed” for a'game with Wabash. The team in
those days ^vas'not the great/^appreciated machine of today but, never-
; tlieless; it-'cannot be denied,' it, was laying the foundation which was to
prbduce ’Rockne and-Dorias, the Millers and Bergmans, and-the great
teams which were;to follow.It has never been said, but it is not beyond
the limits of possibility, that the early football teams under the direc-
tion of Colonel Hoynes were ,wont; fo “bum” to and from their games.
Experience with THE DAILY/ -would strengthen the belief in such a
possibility. The point, however, is this. Everyone is proud of the
Notre'Dame football1 team and1, everyone is anxious to claim it as typi-
- caliy.Notre. Dame.'.; If THE DAILY were given the support of the
। students- in; these; its suckling days, it undoubtedly would grow to
sprightly: manhood; a source of pride to Notre, Dame men and some-
thing to be considered typically Notre'Dame. ’ And it must be remem-
bered: that fundamentally, a publication is most important for the Uni-
versity. ■ If ybu/arri one of the1 inaccessible six hundred,. think this
. Over-f-please; V ’	/	;	.	.	. : ;
The'subscription lists of THE.DAILY must contain'the name
: of every student.; “It is very easy/’ the economical spendthrift will
say, /to borrow a paper, so why should I pay for one?” ■ Because he
owes'itnto his ^school? and: because without his assistance, Notre-Dame
j will be iforced to admit that its college men cannot do what any number
of high school students are doing, publishing a. daily paper.. You six
hundred men ^who seem determihed.to charge through the. year,., with out
signing a subscription blank, reconsider your stand and ask yourself
• ‘ are; you playing fair? When . you ’ sing The Vicibry March and pour
forth-those words “What though the odds be 'great or small/ Notre
Dame will win . oyer, all,” did y ou fever thing that five dollars , is too
great odds to .pay for. the. success;of'something very, very important tb
, Notre: Dame? . You who/‘shakethunder-from the sky,” did
you ever think that, you liad refused: to “shake down”; five dollars that
. your fellow students might “win; OVer all” ? There is a great deal
contained, in;'.The/V.ictory Marcli> win ch? does not,apply wholly to foot-
ball/and you, members of “the Blight/Brigade,” the inaccessible six
. hundred which will not charge a; DAILY, could learn from it to' sign

Of interest to those who will be
• Chicago during the Christmas
Inlidavs is. the announcement that
?£» “Chauve Souris” will open at
the Garrick,. December 16. The
‘'Chauve. Souris” company, with
Nikita Balieff, was one of the first
Russian organizations to come to
America. During their stay, at the
Century Roof they popularized
“The Parade of the Wooden Sol-
diers,” and gave Americans some
idea ’of an.European variety show.
Less opportune is the arrival of
John Barrymore who, according to
Arthur Hopkins, will be seen in
Chicago in “Hamlet” late in Janu-
ary. The theatre at which he will
appear has not. yet been agreed
upon. It. is reported that the . cast
will be,,practically the same with
Tyrone Power as. the King, Blanche
Yurka as the. queen 'mother, Rosa-
lind Fuller as Ophelia, and Frank
Norman Hearn as -the Player
Queen.	.
;• The reversion to Shakespearian
customs in -having the part of. the
player Queen played by a boy is
one of the most interesting phases
of Barrymore’s flyer, in “Hamlet.”
Hearn is comparatively young and
has achieved a name for himself
for his impersonations of women. !
. Not the least distinguished mem-
ber of the company is Tyrone Pow-
er, who has often starred in his own
right, who played the lead with
most-of the great actresses of the
last generation, arid who was seen,
more recently, as Robert in Charles
Rann Kennedy’s, play, “The Ser-
vantin the House;” '	'
L .Here and There
.. Don Perry, 200-pound guard on
the California eleven, has earned
for himself the title of “the wild
man of the line.” He is the best
running guard the Golden Bears
have had in several seasons. ’ Last
year Big Perry consistently warmed
the bench.
PALACE
THEATRE
Before this season the coach
could never get Perry to put any
pep into his work, although he saw
in him good potential football ma-
terial. He finally hit upon the plan
of instructing the squad to razz
Perry on every occasion, but the
big guard took this smiling until
one day in a scrimmage he
“jumped” the guard opposite him,
arid ' was fighting mad the rest of
the afternoon. As a result he tore
huge holes in the line on nearly
every play. .	.	.
; Now -he is as raging in conflict
as he is jovial in ordinary life, and
remains a shining. example that
football strategy is often . most
prominent behind the scenes.
