PONDEROUSPONDERINGS
.Canes, it seems/.should,be:taken■;seriously. ;Until 83'men:of!the'
Senior class , .voted their, approval-of .. wearing canes -as means ’of class
distinction, one was inclined:to>ridicule the idea that canes’could'be .con-
sidered, seriously. / ;	;77-;.’77 ‘	s-; ’ •
. Canes, it had been, thought, were wearing appurtenances: that-were
proper on certain occasions. -It was thought that canes were-quite the
thing to make -impressions^ like the ones that must have’been made'by
Sir Plume, according to Pope. The lines are like these: ■	.-7 7
j , . .Sir Plume, of amber snuff-box-justly vain; • 1 .	: • : ’I
... And the .nice conduct of -a clouded-canb.* !
It was. imagined that-they were commendable superfluities’ for frequent-
ers_of the-local Rialtos, ■ and again becoming , reminiscently poetical, , the.
lines of an old song recurred: : / .	; >	: :	• ‘	.
P marched the lobby, twirled my stick. : :	.
The girls all .cried: “He’s quite the kick.” • -
But,that mood,of levity passed when the 83 men voted for canes.
Although everyone with whom one talked bn the subject seemed to have
voted that way just to show the lawyers that there were other'brave
men. in the school—-or something like that-—it still seemed that canes
were serious,subjects,;staffs of life, or the,like. /	// / 7
. It was recalled that: a ’ cane was a natural thing -to carry,, on a
walking excursion, whether through the wild ways or down the Mich-
igan Boulevard ways./It was recalled that canes:were quite, .commend-
- able parts of dress for certain occasions, ::	./	.,« • • /
•’ But rack ;the head as ”one might/one;could not understand why.
canes ' should be worn on certain .afternoons to: classes ; oh every trip

COLLEGE-MADE BUSINESS MEN
/	. For many years Mr. David Harum and Mr. Babbitt have been
taken, as representative of American, business men, 'men whose chief
pursuit is the dollar, whose ideas of business, economics,; sandwiched
between hearty songs and lusty' j okes, are secured at Rotary club ban-
quets, and who sought his pleasure I at the club /and at the, burlesque
■ ’ show. .' /	. . - . . / •’	' / ’ . '■
, But in the last several years a subtle change has come about? The
new business man hails from the university.; He.is no: longer .the-self-
/ made man; but he is the college-made man. He has a diferent air; ,he is a
new type, different even from each of his fellows.; He has -secured:his
knowledge of business economics in the! university, where experts have
explained. the fundamental; principles, with; the result that he really
knows economics and is able to judge things by/ principled knowledge,
and no longer has to depend on the /lessons of his own experience and
the . recited experiences of Rotarians; He hears speeches' of big busi-
ness men who delight in paying; a visit to .a university,, where young
men will listen-to his every wrird. ।	‘
'/ He discusses all kinds W	in. his 'Chamber of Com-
merce secures , a.,sympathetic - understanding of : all [ pursuits. There,
too, he meets- men from; all parts of the.world, and he is enabled to
learn of places far remote from the-little town ini Wisconsin, from;.which
he came; He makes’ friends, tod, friends from everywhere; who may
be, of assistance to him iii his coming work. ■r ; 7 '	'•	; ' ■ 7 ; . .
7 And, in the better universities, he learns not only business, but he
learns the ■ cultural subjects/of . philosophy/ a
bit’ of history,' a; bit of science, a. bit Iof English literature, and a bit of
other subjpets, / By these-/ studies ■ he /accustoms his/mind, to seek !hbt
only-the material dollar but the spiritual goodsi/as well. He makes
himself so/nuch more’the man and so much less/the machine/. He gives
himself. sb much more expanse, of intellectual, foundation ^upon - which
^bjbmid his special life-pursuit.And, when.lie goes-into;the world,
he/iszablp.to.get/an unlimited) joy- out,of life; not? a limited, one-like
. his Babbitt predecessor,’ for .lie/-the; college-made .business; man/‘has a
spiritually .developed mind/to draw upon—and/the spiritual -is- un-
.■ ■ limited.’./<.<
../•The college-made: man was. once frowned upon by employ er Bab-
bitt. 'But some -o£ the/college-made business men became successfui so
much more rapidly'than, sons of 'Babbitt that the' favor, chabgeiT Now-
^pys;the employe^
He, makes , that a P°lnt in most/of-his advertisements for new,/men. ? '.
And the business courses, grbw^ Five times, as many, mem are now
studying busHiess-m;the/ universities, as ,there; are ‘studying-all other
subjects.. More men are becoming college-made business men,, in ac-
cordance with the law of supply.and demand.! . .	<! ) ■ <
