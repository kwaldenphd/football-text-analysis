LAST NIGHT
Final of Year Last Night;
De Mott, Labedz,Kay, Enz-
ler, in Specials
By NORBERT ENGELS
Rev. Frank Remmes’ alluring
'posters helped to gather a crowd
in Washington Hall last night for
his; orchestra recital. '
... ■ For a school orchestra, they per-
'formed in a creditable manner.
Perhaps .the bowing of the violinT
ists was /not absolutely in unison,
and perhaps: with a bit of attention,
one might have discerned unwritten
dissonances; but taking all in all,
the concert was enjoyable. For the
young- musicians, it represented the
: work of an entire year—an honest
striving, to .acquire .perfection, and
some of; the numbers were indeed
a credit to them. .	,	'	'
It seemed to me, however, that
they played under a grave handi-
cap, an apparently uninterpretive
baton. In the marches, especially,
there'seemed to be a decided lack
of the vim that should characterize
Such ' numbers and . even in " the
■heavy -forte passages, the baton'
swayed peacefully and at the same
. precise altitude. Apparently, it was
left.' to the men themselves to in-
terpret their music. ,/	: ! •	■’/'
J. Edmond de Mott , played’ his
violin numbers well and was ..ac-
companied by Victor Labedz at the
piano. The trid: also provided their
share of. the program.

Year’s Plans

planned by the Dramatic Circle for

hamj in the chair, and discussed the
plans of the organization for next

poses of the Circle. One-act and
three-act plays .will be staged from
talent selected from members
in the club. Different act cliques

By CLIFF WARD
I SAT on the porch
The other night, .
And I got to feeling,'
Rather gloomy .. •
And sort of blue,
So I started to walk, .
Away from home,
But all the while, -
I kept feeling,
Like the dying end,
Of a long illness, r '
And I cussed. and swore,
Then cussed some more,
For allowing myself ’
To lose control
Of that same self/
And “the. more I walked,
The bluer and blacker
My spirits became,
Until I feared	.
That near some lonely
And deserted spot,
I would vanish away .
In a cloud of smoke.

I WAS strolling along, .
When I heard a cry,
From a’tiny babe, .
Who had crawled too far
Away from home,
And.this child looked up,
With, outstretched arms, .
And tears in its eyes,
So I took it up,
And it gave me a smile,
Of which, all man’s wealth
Couldn’t purchase a'part, -
And it seemed - to me,
That somewhere up high, . .
God ha.d smiled, '
At some angel,	.
Who, smiled-at the baby,’
Who smiled at me, •
For such a smile- k
Could only come.
From Heaven itself.

DAY MEN—STOP AND LISTEN!
-	' Not so .many years .ago Notre Dame .men lived together as-,a
unit within the shadow of the Dome. Perhaps it was the splendor
. that radiated from, its golden surface that encouraged , a healthy , and
absorbing interest in the divers student organizations.- . Interest in
some form of athletics,, oratory, dramatics^ debating, student publica-
tions, in short all student affairs' was shown by every student. What
was .of interest to one, interested all. Pep had'its outlet through the
• medium of student activity. . ’ -	. . . .	‘
- -The rapid, growth of the University during the last few years has
caused a change. A large number of students must of necessity live
in South;Bend. This-is regrettable for. those men usually prefer life
- on the campus. The thrill which comes of embellished; rumor to the
student of Badin, 'and the proverbial bull-, which rambles -rampantly,
in many a Sorin suite cannot be. duplicated for their interest in the
life of the city. But more than this, the campus student has more
. time arid opportunity to become a living, active part.of?Notre.Dame. .
Today activity'on the part of the oppidans iiTcampus^ organizations
is on the decline. ..Few day students .interest themselves in'writing,
dramatics, or athletics. Is the day student to blame? No. ' He has
never been properly approached, nor has he had the chance to be
initiated into the spirit of Notre Dame. .	<	-
The first and most obvious remedy which, suggests itself is, of
course;,the erection of more resident halls. This canriot be done over
night, however. /The University is planning;more of them as soon as
. possible. Sooner or later the entire enrolment will be housed on the
•'/ campus., In the meantime, the day men should , have club roorii cen-
trally located in South Bend. There they could be registered. The
particular hobby of each student could be noted, and the talent which
is needed in the .various .campus organizations’ be drawn ,from this
. source. . ■ ■ '	. .	;	\'■
■ Companionship and association with other ’ commuters would. be
. advantageous and provocative of the old Notre Dame spirit of democracy
- and;good fellowship.' The.result would be a NEW Notre Dame spirit
. .of fraternity, with the day students and their campus brothers working
■ ? as a uriit for the. glory of Notre Dame and. their mutuah good.- -
CAN AN OFFICER DO WRONG? .
‘ It was paradoxical that on the eve of the DAILY’S South Bend-
Notre Dame .Friendship edition; a Notye Dame student^ speeding in a
. car, should have been , almost fatally wounded for ignoring an of-
ficer’s signal to stop. 'This unfortunate, incident should not-in any
' way jeopardize the friendship which: has in the last few: years so
splendidly grown between Notre Dame and the citizens and officers
.. of South Bend. ■ .	\	z
’ But .if there is any force-interfering with the constructive .Work
of Father Quinlan, prefect-of.discipline,.and the progressive; consider--
. ate efforts of Chief of Police Lane, that Torce should be discovered and
- ■ stamped out.- For two years the relations between. the student‘ and
- the officials of South' Bend have been remarkably amicable. . Fc>r ;this
. ; we can thank such men as’ Mayor Seebirt arid' Mr. -Lane, and the
student body as a whole;	.	"	5 . .
.	' The student body has been exceptionally amicable, exceptionally
' . law-abiding as student bodies go. In this spirit they have been: opposed
. only by a few scattered officers, men who have- forgotteri that they
are SERVANTS,1 riot persecutors, of the people. 'An example of this
. type is Officer Bates, who has. at certain times violated the most funda-
. . mental fights of American citizenry in order to malce himself better-
~ knpwn as. an /‘active’.’, officer. '	,
. It were better to be confronted by a hold-up' who shoots only
. ; when he has to, rather than.by an officer who depends upon his con-
nectibn with-.the law to protect’r him in any abuse he cares to - inflict.
It may be. true that Officer Luczh'V was aiming at the -tires of Gor-
. - man’s ’machine. ' Assuming that, he had the. right, the'yesiilts of his
marksmanship indicate that it',would be best to equip -'such officers with
‘.‘beanies” or wooden -swords. It has-been truly said, that “Children
should not play with fire” and particularly docs this apply ; to bad
- . children. .	.	:	.	-	< . . L ' -	'
; Gorman has in a sense been a martyr to the cause of South Bend-
-Notre Dame friendship. ' It is to be hoped that his sacrifice is .not in
. . vain, and that the exposed worms gnawing at the tree of Mutual Good-
, will may be crushed. .	;

KEEP YOUR- VISION.
(Oregon Daily- Emerald) .	.•	‘
Usually, ; after a riotous good
time; bn a week-end of excitement;
a queer feeling- comes 'over- all of
us. ■ ,W call : it' “the - blues”; - we
say; we are “low”; in general, .we
subject ourselves to a few hours—■—
or possibly, days—of mental misery,
agonizing mbiherits of self scrutiny-
and criticising We attempt to; ex-
onerate ourselves and . place the
blame on others. - We wait for the
feeling to wear’off. ' • z ;
Sometimes it does, but more often
it doesn’t, Perhaps ,the sun shines,
or; if it has beeri. warm, it rairis.
And we say that the change in the
weather is what was needed.In
reality, it -is a. change in- ourselves-
we need—a stronger purpose, a
renewed energy sufficient, to carry
us ahead, a bigger vision .which will I
give us this strength and energy. [
. -'Sit by /yourself out of1 doors a 1‘
while.. Look at the far-off horizon, I
listen .to the ripple of a continu-|
ously-flowing stream/' enjoy the J
chatter of the birds high up in the
trees, and then let your eyes wan- i
der to the: shrubs, and flowers far |
enough away.'from you. so they I
appear, perfect. Everything will be 1
beautiful — inspiring.: Of - course 1
around you there is soil—mud per- [
haps-—; /tiny ants -chase over 'your ‘
shoes; worms appear .from under f
the leaves; a fat sliiriy snail crawls J
slowly toward' the rotting 'log on I.
which you are seated. . But don’t j
look, at -them. Keep your’.larger |
vision and. the tired, low feeling J
will soon disappear. '	1

The techno-Log
To The Loggers
We acknowledge our sense of
obligation to those who have thrown
' lines to the Log and thereby kept
the editor optimistic. We must,
however, ask you to keep throwing
' fhe'life lines because we shall not
nnhiallv be out of danger until the
end of the school year.
We owe explanation to those con-
tributors whose lines have not been
printed. ’ The reasons for their non-
appearance include: the .sending in
of items too late for one edition
arid stale for the next. Get Sun-
day’s items in Saturday morning.
' It is our policy to look forward;
hence past events lack the appeal
of those forecasting occurrences.
’ Qf ■. course; we welcome write-ups
of games and happenings of general
interest to engineers and to men in
architecture and science..
We 'conclude as we commenced.
We are obliged to the men who
contribute. Keep it up. We shall
be afloat—in danger of sinking—
until the last issue of the DAILY
this year comes from the’ press.

A communication from the em-
ployment manager Of the Packard
Motor Car Company to the dean of
engineering. is substantially as fol-
lows: • -■•'.	'	.
Because of the constant increase
in production, the Packard Co. are
. in the market for good men in sev-
eral lines; The Packard car is made
entirely by .the Packard Company;
and,..consequently, the field for
. good men is extensive.'
. Each year they employ quite a
number , of college men who are
looking for practical experience to
establish better, and set more firmly
’ their theoretical and practical
training. ' A large ' proportion of
their execuitves are college men
and the majority of .them, have
: been advanced from the ranks.
.Conditions at. the present time
point to the fact' that this company
' will have, a number of openings for
both graduates and students at the
end of the school term. Nothing
'definite can be said at this time on
. what, will then be open. ' All appli-
cants are subject to a physical ex-
“aminatinoT-~-The ~examationr is—not,
. however, severe.
. Any who are interested can get
further information through this
column. The Packard Company au-
thorities would be : interested • to
know, of , your experience, : your
studies, and your objective,, in order
that .they may better guide appli-
cants. ■	? ' ; ' '' ’ ■ - -	•
From Off Stage
■ . “Hearts Aflame”. combines a
•good plot, capable, direction, and
admirable acting. .‘The most diffi-
cult to please can find only one
fault with it: it is a little too, long,
but many: plots with not one-half
its< merit have been prolonged
beyond reason.” , ; . /- . .	:
. Anna Q. Nilsson, whom you saw
last in “Adam’s. Rib,” is in the cast,
as is Craig Ward.. Both^ are- pleas-
ing and more than competent in
: their roles, but they are completely
overshadowed by the really remark-
able acting /of. Frank . Keenan.
Keenan’s interpretation .of Luke
Taylor, the lumber magnate, is one
> which ; is difficult to classify. At
times he reminds: you of the im-
• mortal Lightnin’ Bill Jones, and at
others he seems /to. be a combina-
tion of the soap manufacturer-in
. “It' Pays to Advertise” and the
kindly Civil War veteran in. “The
..Copperhead,” with a few <of^ the
irascible characteristics of Achile
. Cortelon thrown in. for good meas-
ure. In “Hearts Aflame” Frank
Keenan strengthens his. claim to. the
distiction of being one of America’s
\ best .character actors—a claim that
is fairly difficult to disprove. ,	.
SOCIOLOGISTS
IN THE PRISON
Investigate Conditions and
Find Startling Contrasts
. There
To supplement theory with prac-
tice, Professor R. R. Macgregor arid
five of his class in sociology visited
the Indiana state prison at Mich-
igan City on Tuesday. Their .trip
was prompted by a sincere desire to
see prison life as it is today under
scientific and humane management;
to . see the prisoner at his work,
apparently reconciled to the routine
and his strenuous tasks, but show-
ing in his countenance the sorrow
he feels in knowing that his Amer-
ican citizenship—one of his greatest
treasures—is temporarily or per-
riianeritly hidden from. him by an
eclipse of his own making. ,
Under Warden Edward .Fogarty,
former Notre Dame football star
and once mayor of South Bend, one
finds what is today the ideal prison
administration. ' The contrast be-
tween present conditions and those
of former times is indeed startling.
Sofne years ago it. was another crime
added to the.prisoner’s°blotted-rec-
ord if he dared to speak to an offi-
cial, passing his work-bench; under
the old regime a kind word or
•friendly smile was unheard of in the
treatment of’the urifortunates.' But
today—can we say that things have
bben radically changed, or is it. bet-
ter to say that Mr.. Fogarty has
merely injected into his institution
a few humane' touches that have
changed the bleak walls of the pris-
on into a home- of instruction for
the men sent there for correction?
'' The prison hospital is a maiwel of
ihodern equipment and . sanitation.
Attending physicians and dentists
are maintairied, and every..illness,
no matter how trivial, is treated
with all the care oui’ finest hospitals
could ever accord. The hospital for
the criminal insane, with its large
sun parlor and attractive interior,
resembles a spacious hotel more
than an institution of its rather re-
pulsive nature..	,	.	-
In the cell blocks the . visiting
party saw the conveniences of each
little cell with its running 'water,
comfortable bed, electric light and
bookcase holding reading matter of
the prisoner’s own choosing, includ-
ing novels, magazines and even the
morning, paper. ....
. As one ' enters the different fac-
tories of the prison, he, forgets that
he is not in a large clothing factory,
garment mill, or shoe manufactur-;
ing:plant. In, the steel plant.he” is
totally unaware that the house
stpves> street signs, license plates,
and engines used throughout the
state are made' by prisoners,- all» ex-
perts in their respective trades. Oth-
er industries are the tobacco' plant,
■printing shop, marble works and
twine factory. The products of
these industries are contracted for
by ’ large1 commercial firms: in the
United States.	'
Each morning cards are handed
to the prisoners on which they may
write any complaint, wish or "com-
ment. . The cards are; then collect-'
ed, and ; those requesting a visit
from the warden are granted their
desire. Mr. Fogarty hears ...their
troubles and tries to give them all
the possible comfort of consulta-
tion., .;■ • . •... .- .' ,
The 'prison is . self-maintaining,
and the, prisoners are paid f dr their
work/ An incident which occurred
at' the, prison will interestingly
stress this point: A colored man at
the .prison, on receiving the state-
ment of his bank accouiit, checked
the 'figures and found that his. bal-
ance was . one cent less than it
should be;. 'Calling the warden to
his cell he explained that the.bank

AN APPETIZING RECIPE.
We were walking down to the
boarding house for q meal the other
evening accompanied by Bob How-
land and Melvin Rohrback. Bob
noticed • an agle worm creeping
lazily along the path and he. re-
marked that it would make excel-
lent food for the fish in,the aquar-
ium at Washington University
which he- had recently visited.
“They have a maggot factory
there,” he continued, “that is con-
tinually busy .raising thousands of
worms' to feed to the fish. The
factory is a small house built over
the fish pond and is partly filled
with dead, fish and refuse. This
becomes the breeding place .for
flies, • and thus are formed the
worriis and maggots—” Needless
to say we enjoyed the meal thor-
oughly.	r.

' IT’S BUSINESS '
‘Jimmy Hayes and Butch Haecker,
anxious to promote the financial in-
terests : of the DAILY, spent a few
hours analyzing what.percentage of
male and female advertisers utilize
the classified ad columns in . other
college papers. They took the . Ore-
gon Emerald- and found that of a
total - of 43 want ads run in one
month, 16 were “lost” ads. turned
in to the business department by
women. Only three'men advertised;
The fellows who advertised lost
note books, a suitcase, and a “Span-
ish comb set with red stones.” The.
articles advertised as “lost” by the
girls were, fraternity pins, fountain
pens, watches, umbrellas and wear-
ing apparel; ~ Hayes said that when
they finished the survey Haecker.
wanted to know if it were always
proper for girls to advertise when
they lost a fraternity pin.- He ques-

Defeats Sullivan; to Play
Foglia for the Champ-

John Quincy . Adams, continuing
to. play his super-game of golf, de-
feated Bill Sullivan in the semi-
finals yesterday, six up and five to
go. ’ Adams', is now qualified to
meet Joe Foglia in the finals for the
championship and. the trophy cup,
donated by Eugene O’Brien. .
. ' Adams began behind Sullivan
who succeeded in holing-his shots,
consistently better than Adams dur-
ing , the early part of the game.
After the first few holes; however,
Adams began to .creep- up' on his
opponent and ended the first nine
holes with the same score. ,	.
Adams had five up at the 19th,
was four up on the 20th, . arid re-
tained his lead until the 31st hole,
when he won, six up and five to go.
On the} 30th hole Adams caught
the ditch and required four strokes
while Sullivan,. after sending a
beautiful mashie to' the green, was
down in three and wbn the hole. On
the. next; hole, Sullivan fell short
of the green while Adams hooked
to the left. Both' were on in two
arid down -in four. , The hole was
halved' and the - match went to
Adams. 1 , . ;	• '	.

' * ; • The Fighting Irish felt the power,
of j the - Conference ; .Champs • and
. ' ■) went; down before .the onslaught of
• \ the Michigan ; U. batters/ -12-4, at
Cartier. Field on - Memorial Day.
. The Wolverines.brought a powerful,
. • .well ‘ balanced; club with' plenty of
.' reserve ‘ strength * to , Notre Dame
/-. and. defeated the Irish by sheer
force. -	,	”

The -'Michigan -victory : was no
v. . fluke, but real and decisive, but, had
> ' Dick Falvey been in form, undoub't-
/. o- edly there would have,, been a- dif-
,,	ferent. story.; - Falvey,' who - has
pitched splendid ball this season,
> was off color on the day of the big
-j - game and. was batted-hard-by Mich-
, igan. - Then, too, the. Irish: felt the
: y. > loss of Sheehan and .the-infield' was
-:. , considerably, weakened. . The: Irish
- - as'a team played good ball, but they
’ were unable ,to hit' in ■ the; pinches
, and fell down in the fielding' at
critical times.: Red 'Magevney, who
replaced Falvey,. pitched good ball,
L but errors allowed Michigan to
" score several times. • /, ,	\
