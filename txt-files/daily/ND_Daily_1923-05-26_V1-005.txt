EDISON’S NEW IDEA
z Since the time that Thomas A. Edison made his absurd question-
. ' naires public, college students have been justly suspicious of his opin-;
ions concerning .unscientific matters. . His most recent observation, how-
- ever, .concerning', the influence of. the motion picture, in the school,
appears more reasonable, even though it is somewhat exaggerated. And
because of the part which Edison lias played in the development of the
motion picture, his views on'this matter deserve consideration.
“I think; motion pictures have just started,:and it is; my opinion
• ' that in twenty years children will be taught through pictures , and not
through books.” Such is the prophecy made by the electrical wizard.
Prophecies of similar import have been made by others, and,
although they have, not been realized completely, there has been enough
progress :to indicate that Edison’s .hopes are not entirely unwarranted.
One has only to mention the ‘great aid. that the motion picture has been
,to justify an expectation of further5advancement in an educational way.
■ . -. Tf,. however, Edison means literally .that the/cinematograph' "will
- absolutely supplant the text books, even in the-elementary and second-
ary schools, the accuracy of his statement may be' challenged. The
motion" picture may be a useful supplement to, but not a complete and
' practical substitute for, books.	■ ’
*	. ‘ One can easily see how the too often dull subject of geography can
be made more interesting through the travelogue, and how history can
be made more realistic through the pictured battle but in both subjects
there is a/great deal which will always have to be learned from,books.
Arid in the several branches of mathematics it is difficult to see how the
■.-movie screen' can /eliminate the .‘blackboard.; •	.
■ Yet it is perhaps, in the study of literature that the. motion picture
will be most ineffective. ' The art. of writing;. for the development of
.which the masterpieces are studied, can riot be acquired by a camera
■ i' study.	■
’ Edison may be on the right track; but it*is not likely that the pub-,
lishers of text, books are in any.pressing danger of being left without
an occupation. When the news reel has displaced,the newspaper, and
.■ / when the comedy has displaced the;humorous magazine, we may expect
/■ to see the prqjectirig machine take the. place of the text book. , ■	?.??

THE OLD ORDER
(Harvard Crimson)
• “Class -spirit,” complains a’ Cor-
nell paper, “seems to be; sadly on
the wane. . ;. . . ,. . It seems a pity,
that such should'be the case.” The
annual mad-rush lacks the vigor it
formerly had. At Dartriibuth ■ it is
found that, this year’s freshman-

to the’ impression that the fight is a
nuisance - anyway, .and had best be
abolished.” Such a‘ condition is crit-
icised by a- college graduate who
recalls in a' letter to a Philadelphia

“Yea', .Rowbottom” at Pennsylvania

Young, Dean of Mechanical EngL
<■ neering at Purdue Uriiversity,/Pro-

us that the last time Mr.- Young vis-
■ ited us was: just 24 years ago. At
that’time Mr. Young was third base-

The pitcher for Notre Dame was
Ed. Reulbach, later big league star,
and it was he who scored the win-
ning. run at the end. of-the 14th
- inning. The final score was three
to two, our favor.	’
Professor Young attacked his
subject of “Combustion” in a mas-
terly mariner, illustrating the deep-
' er theory with slides.In a logical
:	way he proceeded from the elemen-
tary and theoretical side of the dis-
. cussion to. the practical applications
' of the principles involved. .Many of
. the points he touched upon, are not
to be'found in text books or articles^
_______they come from his own expert*

„ project. One. of the . important
? - points to be covered- in the calcula-
\ . tions' is the velocity of the wa|:er
■■' ."/flow. In order to obtain this infor-
■ • - mation it is necessary, to make ob-
servations'with a/ writer meter at
: different points from shore to shore.
' As a means .of anchorage, a steel
. ' cable is attached to .a tree.'on each
■ shore; and to' this cable: a',boat is
/attached. The men work from the
boat.’ : The YeaL difficulty is ericouri-
•; .. tered in. getting the cable, which is
too heavy to be. placed an the,boat,
/ from shore to shore. The current of
’ the riyer, is so frist that the boat is
:	. carried'down stream before the op-
• • ' posite/shore can ber reached;/ This
'.J : plan • of s trying to tow/ the - cable
across -'by boat .:;was . abandoned.-
' Finally a heavy rope was, placed
'	' across, the river; this was ‘to act. as
, a suspended support for the. cable.
- All went1 well, until the rope'broke
under the . weight. / of . the- cable.
. The falling-cable, struck the boat^
sinking, it. to the ’bottom of the river .
-. and precipitating the two Notre

N.D. Students Soon
. Two former Notre Dame men will
be ordained at the Church of ’Our.
Lady of the Sacred Heart on June
24, it was learned yesterday. They
are E. Vincent Mooney, C.S.C., of
’16, and Frank J. - Boland, <C.S.C.,
of ’18.	-
Mr. Mooney, was a grand knight
of the Knights of Columbus, busi-
ness manager of the 1916 Dome,,
and a monogram baseball, outfielder
while at Notre Dame. Mr. Boland
was a . varsity debater at the. Uni-
versity, and did graduate work-at
Michigan Agricultural College, and
Ypsilanti Normal. ■ He was principal
of schools at Kendallville, Ill., be-
fore he began his studies at Holy
Cross College, Brookland, D. C. He
has been associate editor of the
Bengalese, published here. -
■ THE SWAN SONG
■ All voices are now raised in the
last verse of the tune of 1922-23.
The former humming has now swell-
ed in, volume to a paean of antici-
pation and regret. It is sung with
varying tempo, depending on. the
mood and the immediate futures of
the songsters.- The chorus echoes
tfle refrain, “The Last Time.” The
last time s for the laundry kit, for
doughnuts at breakfast, for:the;cli-
mactic ontology - quiz, for the ele-
vated sonata recital. The last time!
In ; Allegro, . Il Pehseroso, out-of
tunjo, the* girls proclaim it, carol it,
lament it. • The strain would, in-
dee^, grow irksome were it not for
these twists that come from the lips
of /an underclassman who is leaving
ad libitum, or from the heart of a
graduate who is leaving ad infini-
tupn.	'
' /It’s- a gay-sad -song, this “Last
Time” chorus.. Its grand finale will
coirne. in’trunk packing, the screech-
ing Yellow!. Taxis,; and- the hurried
embraces -of'.friends. . Unlike most
choruses,; however, this-little selec-
tion) has ? neither; retard nor. pianis-
sim^/for, whenj it • comes\- time to

The final Interhall contest will be
held next week May.-. 31,’when, the
campus track stars will'compete for.
the Interhall- championship in • the:
annual outdoor, track meet.. A briF.
liant array of. speed'arid weight men'
will take the field with the Brown-:
son aggregation having, a slight edge
over the others/, prpven . by their
ability to win the indoor meet held
last March... ;• -
In that contest Brownson scored:
45 points, 20 points ahead of Sorin;
Hall, who at that time was. favored
with the speed of Leo McTiernan, a
recent winner of-: a varsity, track
monogram,' which; makes him ineli-
gible for Interhall .competition? Mc-
Tiernan scored alone, 11% of' the
25 -points garnered by the Sorin
Hall athletes. - -	’ ■ . - .	-
Crowe, in the dash, and Johnson/
in- the hurdles, both of; Brownson,
are expected to' star. Bidwell, of
Walsh/ who ?was. fourth high point
man at the indoor runnings, , is due
to take the mile run and place in
the half. Conlin and Wagner, .of
the freshman team, are good bets
for the half mile:,and1 have showed
up well .in outdoor practice.,' The
field events are well distributed
among the halls, although Corby
suffers the loss of T¥.ank..Milbauer
in' the shot put. . Brownson will put
