eral years, . will be revived soon if
present plans of organization are
successful.

gether, as far as possible, those men
who spent their first years at Notre
Dame in the preparatory school or
the minims. . : The Lifers r.has been
one of the most active organizations
on the campus, but due to the pass-'
ing of the preparatory department,
will die. out in a few years. Re-
quirements for membership are that
the men be in his fifth or later year
at Notre Dame. ’

N. C. W. C. NEWS SERVICE
Sometime, perhaps soon, 'the Notre Dame Daily may become
affiliated with-the National Catholic Welfare Conference News Serv-
ice. Since this is so, and since the service is of interest to every Cath-
olic, it is pertinent to note the gratifying increase in prestige of that
service.
During the past year, as shown by the report of Bishop Walsh,
D.D., chairman z.of the Press and Publicity Department, this service
has-gained both in influence and in revenue. Although the receipts-from
July 1, 1922, to June 30, 1923, total only $22,890, they show a credit-
able increase over the receipts of the previous year, which were but
$14,730. It may be said also that these receipts are a very inadequate
representation of the activity, of this service since the revenue furnishes
less than one-half of the cost. :
. Even more important is the recognition which the N. C. W. C.
News Service has won for itself in the newspaper world. One of the
.greatest news achievements of the year was its distribution of the first
full authentic report of the trial of the Russian Catholic prelates. This
.was considered of such news value by The New York Times and The
St. Louis Globe Democrat that, on the Sunday following its publica-
tion in the Catholic papers, they gave it a full page. In this report it
was proved that the Russian Catholic prelates were innocent of any.
disloyal or revolutionary activity. . ’	-
The service has-been proved to, be almost invaluable to the Cath-
olic press. It endeavors to acquaint Catholics of . what people of the
faith are doing,'and endeavors to get the truth on matters of Catholic
. interest—so -'often/misrepresented- by prejudiced .reporters ? or editors.
The interest of the national daily^press in the- service is significant.
It indicates the rvalue of the service/;and its growing power.,
PROGRESS IN TRAVEL
Scarcely a day now passes in: which we do not read of some new
development in	day a record for .speed is broken; again,
some; inconvenience is done away with; and, less: frequently some new
mode qf: transportation is invented. Yet in this scramble for material
progress the dependence of it. all upon the Creator is so often ignored
that. it is-.reassuring. to learn of a case'in which dependence on God is
acknowledged: by a?.pretty consideration, of the religious element of
•	. travel. !	'	’ •	.
•	: ' Such a case is found in the recent -installation of altars on the
ocean steamers of the Cunard linesi Before the liner. Franconia sailed
from Liverpool on its maiden voyage to New York, a fully equipped
altar together with four sets of vestments was. placed on board to be
at the disposal of any Catholic priests who might be-passengers.
The first public mass was said on board the ship on the Feasts
of Saints Peter and Paul by Father McCarthy, of Bangor, Maine. On
Sunday mass was said by Father Mulvihill, of Limerick, Ireland. In
addition to the first and second-class passengers, many Irish passengers
of the third class attended, filling the entire space on the aft’deck.
The ship’s crew furnished the altar boys.
: As Archbishop Curley, of Baltimore, Monsignor Strickland and
, several other priests were passengers on the return voyage to Eng-
land, holy mass was celebrated many times. During the round trip
voyage of the.'Franconia mass was lead twenty-two times, a record for
Catholic services on a ship at sea. Since it is seldom that a trans-
Atlantic, liner sails without a priest on board, Catholic passengers in
•the future will have the.opportunities for,performing their religious,
duties daily. '	; i !
\ This installation of altars on ocean liners for that celebration of
the sacrifice of the mass seems to prove that the great-part played in
the lives of Catholics by their religion , is gradually being recognized.
Thus it may be said'that the example of those allow no obstacle to keep
them from-hearing mass has not passed unnoticed even in the world
•at large;. And in this proof of the power of consistent good example
may H found sufficient reason for. believing that the Catholicatmos-
phere/and life, of Notre Dame make a deeper impression upon those
who come in contact with' it than we might sometimes think.

DARWIN AND CONVOCATION
, “A lamb,” says Charles Darwin,
“loves to. frisk, about upon ' the
smallest hillock because his ances-
tors used;to 'run over the peaks of
the Alps/ A small boy will go. put
of his way to climb a tree because
his predecessors -used- to -swing
through/a'tree.” ,	'
: Darwin never attended a convo-
cation at; K. :U. f •? <
; A speaker of . note comes to the
. platform to address the student
body. - Everything’ is quiet while
they give him the “once over.”
Then powder supplies, notebooks,-
candy, and deaf-and-dumb language
are produced, and ,the disturbance
commences. With utter . disregard
for the feelings of the speaker, - the
audience proceeds to make as much
noise as possible and to go through
all the motions of the traditional
monkey. -	'
Convocation is no place to go to
study, or to make dates. If it . is
necessary to, get .up .and leave, it
■will "not make one appear important
to kick over a row of chairs during
the exit. A little more, respect is
due to” visiting; speakers.—^Univer-

Hooda
Hooda was getting his picture
taken.
“What,” said the photographer,
“what sort of view.would you like?”
“What would you suggest?”, said
our hero.
The photographer looked at Hoo-
da. Then he looked Ibvingly at an
imitation gun in the corner. Then
he flushed, put his finger in his
mouth and pirouetted, and said, “I
don wanna tell.”
“Be calm, compose yourself, col-
lect yourself?’?-, said Hooda. “I
know what you are thinking. You
are thinking that I would make a
good soldier. But I do not want it
taken that way. Could you take a
picture of me with a butterfly net
in: one hand and a club in the
other?”
The man thought and then said,;
“I think it could be done, but why
do you want it that way?”
“I want to represent a great Eu-
ropean diplomat,” said Hooda.
“Why not substitute the net for
a pocketbook, and represent a res-
taurant owner?” said the man.
“No,” said Hooda/ “we will com-
promise. I will pose with a fly in
one hand and an elephant in the
other, and represent Ananias.”,
And.so it went until in the end
Hooda posed "with a piece of cheese
in one hand and no bread in the
other. The effect was powerful. It
brought strong light upon-the old,
old adage, “A piece of cheese alone
is better than’no sandwich.”.
But the photographer >had aimed
wrong,' and' when the pictures were
developed they showed apparently
nothing but the cheese. Closer
scrutiny revealed,. however, that it
was nothing but Hooda’s face that
showed.
So they .made, a neat, little for-
tune selling; them for puzzles.

WTiat They Say
IT MUST BE DONE!
[Daily Nebraskan]
With the number of seat reser-
vations already surpassing all pre-
vious records of Nebraska football,
it is probable that 30,000 persons
will watch the Cbrnhuskers of 1923
block the victorious onrush of Rock-
ne’s Irishmen from Notre.Dame.
Not alone will Nebraska lovers of
the pigskin sport scan every play
bf our team—the nation will be siz-
ing up Nebraska. East and west,
north- and south, followers and crit-
ics of football will observe with su-
preme' interest Notre Dame’s at-
tempt at revenge for the Cornhusk- '
er victory of last year. .'
Thirty-three years o£ honorable
football history have lent to the
University .a notable prestige, which
goes on trial November 10. /'
' Eleven men in moleskins are not
the sole defenders of this reputa-
tion. ' Every'student/"every alum-
nus, and every friend of Nebraska
must contribute to the defense of
this prestige by unswerving loyalty.
This University implores a victory
and demands a united Husker spirit.

From Off Stage
Because he is said to be hand-
some, they have built a picture
around' Thomas Meighan in which
the ladies chase the poor fellow
until he is finally married. Wallace
Reid was billed in such pictures and
almost every man that has been
said to be rather sheikish, has had
.the same fate. It isn’t an unpleas-
ant role, of course, but it makes us
smile—reminds us of the picture in
which Ben Turpin played the sheik
in the “Shriek of Araby,” or some-
thing like that.
Meighan’s . picture, “Woman
Proof,” at- the LaSalle this week,
furnishes a pleasant afternoon.
Meighan plays Tom Rockwood, one
of a family each of whom have
been willed a million, provided all
are married by a certain date. In
the early part of the picture Rock-
wood isn’t affected by flappers, zip-
pers or old-fashioned girls nor does
he bother about a possible million
dollars. But when Louise Halliday,
played by Lila Lee, meets Rockwood
he changes his mind about women.'
Due to the tricks of the pesky vil-
lain, he almost fails to marry the
girl in time to get the million for
himself, and incidentally for the ;
other members of his family.
That’s the plot, as concocted by
George (Ade, and in which Mary (
Astor and Robert Agnew have parts ;
of prominence.
team on youi’ side of the Rockies
I to meet Knute , Rockne’s Notre
| Dame eleven in the post-season in-
। tersectional contest Christmas Day.
1 We have seen Notre Dame. Twenty-
five to two they slaughtered Prince-
I ton last Saturday. The two resulted
। from a safety. Four times the Hoo-
I siers crossed the Tiger line for
touchdowns. And for 60 minutes
of actual play there was never a
second that the superiority of the
team of Rockne, offensively or de-
fensively, was not established.
What a football team it is!
• We have never seen one quite like
■ it. If this be treason from a Na-
tive Son, at least it is the truth.
Notre Dame has more plays let-
ter perfect right now, with the sea-
son three weeks old, than most of
these teams back here will have in
the entire schedule.
Notre Dame has a collection of
backs, answering to • the names
Crowley, Don Miller, Layden, Berg-
man, Stuhldreher and Reese, who
can do anything with a football
that ever‘was done, of ever will be.
Notre Dame has a line that tore
holes in Princeton, and when the
Tigers had the ball stopped their
rushes dead in their tracks.
Notre Dame showed ability to :
circle the ends, smash the line,
break up forward passing attack,
either • by. hurrying the passer,
knocking down his heaves, or by
intercepting thei tosses.
Notre Dame had three kicks
blocked, one resulted in the safety.
The other two were goal kicks after
touchdowns, but in all that interest-
ing afternoon,' these three faults
were all the closest observed could
find with the young men who
learned their football under Rockne.
Consider these figures. Notre
Dame gained 462 yards in all, as
compared with Princeton’s 101—
241 yards by rushing, 155 yards by
end running and only 66 yards by
the use of the forward pass, gen-
erally supposed to be the Notre
Dame chief method of attack. For-
get that stuff. Notre Dame uses
the pass only when the enemy is
looking for something else, and as
the enemy is generally looking for
the forward pass, Notre Dame, with
a style of football that is 100 per
cent deceptive and constructed
solely on the principle of “now you
see it and now you don’t,” Notre
Dame skirts the . end and slides
through the lines with dexterity and
ease.
Distinctive Garb
for Chemistry Profs
Quick, Watson! the whisk broom!
Rev. Julius Nieuwland, of the
Chemistry department, declares that
professors of chemistry took advan-
tage of his absence last week. When
he returned from his trip , to Wash-
ington, he discovered them arrayed
in clean, new, gray dusters.
“Professors will not be mistaken
for students since the innovation,”
said Father Nieuwland. , “What is
the distinguishing mark ' of the
chemistry professor? The duster!”

Chicago, an orator of national rep-
utation, gave a special lecture un-
of
der the auspices of the College of
the College of Commerce, entitled
“Chinese Life and Customs,” at
Washington hall, to which all stu-
dents were invited. *
Mr. O’Donnell, who has been in
close contact with the people of
China for many years, spoke of the
dislike the white man had for the
Chinaman because he did everything
opposite to the white man. Be-
cause the Chinese do many things
differently from the white man. he
said, because the Chinese begin
from the left-hand side to read a
newspaper, white men criticize the
Chinaman and believe he is not as
capable as a white man.
Mr. O’Donnell . stated that the
Chinaman was the most honest per-
son in the world. He could be
trusted always and as example, Mr.
j O’Donnell eited some fablous sums
of money that had been loaned to
people of China by business men of
Chicago, and which were always
paid. The government and the
home life of China were also com-
mented upon.
Mr. O’Dcnneil expressed hopes of
returning soon to deliver • another
lecture.

ROCKMEN MEET
CORNHUSKERS
Westerners Have Two Weeks to
Prime for Irish Clash; Huskers
Have Two Great,Veterans.
। The Nebraska football team will
face their supreme test in football-
dom when Knute K. Rockne and his
wonder team journey , to Lincoln to
play them .next Saturday. The
game will be of almost as much im-
portance as the Army and Prince-
ton games with the Irish.
a The wheat-land gridders had the
advantage of an off day last Satur-
. day and during the two weeks since
the Rockmen met and defeated
' Georgia Tech, the Cornhuskers have
been preparing for their annual
. struggle with the Irish, which for
the past five years has proven to be
one of the hardest games on the
schedule of both schools.
The student body at Lincoln have
but one thought uppermost in their
minds: “Beat Notre Dame.” Dur-
ing the past two weeks the Nebraska,
mentor has stressed this one idea,
for the purpose of impressing upon
the minds of his moleskin warriors
the immensity of the task that looms
up before his men next Saturday.
He also has been impressing upon
them what.a sweet glory and satis-
faction it would, be. to stave off the
attack of the wonder team and bury
the brilliant proteges of Rockne’s
under the pall of defeat the Irish
so deftly wrapped around the forms
of three great intersectional teams.
Nebraska has two veterans' in
their line-up that played against the
Rockmen in 1921 at Homecoming,
when the Irish had a team that sent
•several’of •'her stars to/all-American
ranks. .•	-	;	'
. Noble and Lewellyn are football
men in every sense of the word and
are now following-in the footsteps
of their all-America.n. teammate,
Wellers, whose presence in the Corn-
husker line-up .will be sadly missed
this year. Both players , are fast
and heavy and display some bril-
lian football tactics both on the de-
fense and offense.
Nebraska has not shown that
power and drive this year that they
have shown in other years but it
must be considered that they have
met teams that were highly per-
fected in the manly sport, and since
the season opened, have swept all
opposition out of their way with
their irresistible attack.. To date
the Cornhuskers have played a
scoreless tie with the leading title
contenders in the Missouri Valley
conference race, and with Illinois,
though they were unable to stop the
drive of Bob Zuppke’s sensational
Star, “Red” Grange..
• When they stack up against the
Rockmen they will me,et a jhalf
dozen “Red” Granges in Miller,
Layden and Crowley; Maher, Cer-
ney and Bergman. The Cprnhusk-
ers’ forward wall will also meet a
line that, according to dope, will be
far superior to the Illinois line.
And when it comes to matching
coaching wits, one remembers West
Point, Princeton and Georgia Tech.
But even so, the Cornhuskers have
always been dangerous and are al-
ways feared.
This week will be a series of hard
practice sessions for . the Irish.
Rockne .will further -perfect a few
new tricks to try out on the Corn-
buskers, that have not yet been dis-
played.
Whether or not Rockne will usq
his passing game against the West-
erners next .week will probably be
a matter of last minute decision.
In considering its use, it will be re-
membered that in the last half of
the game last year, which the Irish
lost 14 to 6, an aerial attack un-
corked by the Hoosiers’ brilliant
backfield created havoc in the Ne-
braska ranks and with a few more
minutes of play, the score would
have been- increased a fe-fr notches.
The passing game has been so
much used by the Rockmen that it
has come to be expected. Because
of this Rockne has not used it as
much this season as in former.years,
holding it for a surprise attack if
needed. The running game with the
speedy Hoosiers' of this year, has
been sufficient to place the pigskin
across the enemy’s goal line with-
out great difficulty.
With Layden and Stange, of the
first-water type in the kicking de-
partment, and a group of lesser-
