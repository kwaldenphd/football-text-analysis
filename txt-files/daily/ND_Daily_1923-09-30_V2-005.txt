IRISH DEFEAT
KAZOO ELEVEN;
SCORE, 74 TOO
Visitors Outplayed in One-Sided
Game; Maher Scores on Open- -
ing Kick-Off, on 90-Yd. Run.
BY THOMAS COMAN.
William “Red” Maher, emblaz-
oned his name in Notre Dame’s foot-
ball history as one of the most de- _
ceptive and shifty -half-backs that
ever played with the “Fighting”
Irish, when Notre Dame easily de- ' ;
feated Kalamazoo College, 74-0, on
Cartier field, yesterday afternoon.
Kalamazoo, while not providing
any great amount of competition for
the Rockmen, gave them a chance '
to display some. of the best open
field running that has ever been ,
seen on the local gridiron.' Begin-
ning with Maher’s snake dance from
the 10-yard line through .a broken .
field to the Kazoo goal, for which
almost perfect interference was pro-
vided, the fleet Irish backs contin- .
ued to set the stands ■wild with ex- .
citement by long end runs/and line
smashes that completely broke down -
the resistance of the opposing
eleven. ■
’ No First Dodns. .	.'
Not once during the entire game
did .the Kalamazoo team make their
first downs and of the three for-
ward passes that they tried, not one ’
of them, was completed. The Irish > ’ .
backfield, masters of the passing.,
game, are ■ almost sure .destruction ’	/
to an opposing aerial attack.
One of the big factors in the sue- .
cess,' qf^th^line-smashing-- and-end-• ’--7
ruhning?;game as played yesterday
by the Rbckmeri, was the perfect co- .
operation of the linesmen in hold-
ing out the opposing line, thereby .
protecting their backfield men on
punting, off-tackle smashes and ends
runs. . The backfield’s defense of
the runner was a brilliant revelation,
when time after time, the opposing
ends and tackles were brushed aside
to clear, the path for the balltoters?
’ Cerney Hits Center. *	.
Crowley, Bergman, Miller, Con-
nell.and Hauser followed the pace
set. by Willie Maher, in turning the
game into , a track meet, with long
runs of 50 to 60 yards. /Enright at
full, scored a touchdown in the sec-
ond quarter, that was the direct re- '
suit of an effective line charge. <
Cerney, opening the game at full- .
back, fairly destroyed the center
of the Kalamazoo line byvterrific / ,
plunging.	.
jA fumble on the one yard cost
Notre Dame another touchdown, -
but it left Kalamazoo in a bad way •
for a few minutes, because the goal ~
post was so close to the ball that
the Kazoo backs did a circle dance \
around the post in order to , buck	'
the.line for two yards. ?	. ...	,
'	. Scout Enjoys Game.	?
Another. Notre Dame touchdown	>
was momentarily impeded, when the	.
Kazoo safety man stopped Liver-
good, who had made a fast, hard .
drive through the center of the
line and broke away from the. sec- "
bndary defense for 30 yards.	-
The Lombard scout, who attended
the game, had something to think
about before the final whistle-blew.
The plays ‘were reeled off so. fast
that it was with difficulty that he. .
kept track of the names of the loose-
jointed backs that so easily wove - •
their way through the Kalamazoo ,
defense. '	• .	.
The exceptionally fine weather '	.
brought a large crowd of spectators,?
estimated at 3,500. The Kalamazoo t
eleven were the first on the field and
proceeded to run signals. A wild ’.
outburst of cheering greeted the
appearance of the Notre Dame . -
team, who followed closely upon the _
field after the Celery City aggrega-
tion.	’	-

goal.* Captain Jacogs kicked off for ,

Artist of the Harp Is a Phenomenal
, Artist Says DAILY
' Critic.
Alberto Salvi, who will give a
recital in Washington hall on Oc-
tober 8, has been heard in over 200
Americanv cities and in each has
been acclaimed a phenomenal artist.
Mr. Salvi is a young virtuoso not
yet in his thirties, but still his rec-
ord of achievements is astounding.
When .a child, he played for the
Italian court, . and since then has
amazed ' the concert audiences of
both Europe and America. .
. Salvi’s playing is really a revela-
tion to his? hearers.. In addition to
his. wonderful technique, he has dis-
covered new effects and hitherto,
unthought of beauties in the harp.
' With his immense gold harp, built
for him by Wurlitzer, Salvi is.cre-
ating a sensation and one critic has
said, “What Bach was to the organ,
what Paganini was to the violin,
Salvi is to the .harp.”—N. E. ' -

ACTIVITY AND THE STUDENT
One marvelously' beautiful September-morning a young student
awakened with an idea. Like a typhoon suddenly challenging a ship
on a fair sea, he had been inspired with the thought that participation
to any extent in student activity is a capricious bon-mot, a treacherous’
boomerang. Now, in many respects this young student was right. An
uncontrollable participation in purposeless activity is a waste of time.
Student activity without a'purpose is like a ship without a rudder—
aimless, deviating, delirious..
Most student activity has a very, definite purpose. An extensive
interest in this is healthful. , The undergraduate must possess the virtue
of self-constraint. For want of a restraining factor some men are en-
gaged during the greater part of four years in combating difficulties of
their own making. .There are plenty of campus activities to keep all
interested. No man or group of men should attempt to monopolize
■them.
Four years of University life are given a student for action. Ac-
tion demands thought and speculation. If the busy student organizes
The mystery of Hooda’s missing
“W” thickens. It is now getting
really thick, and is more in keep-
ing with our hero. The mystery at
last is taking on the hue of a suc-
cess.' Ima Lyre, Smuggle Hints col-
umn editor, again states that she
has washed her hands of the whole
thing. • palmolively speaking, we
are glad. A. - Sharpe Knows, star
reporter, has..added very little to
solving the problem of the Stolen
“W.” He said, “I find this man
Hooda an idiot of the first water.”
Beyond this he has said ndthing. ’
A cataract bf letters has been
pouring in. All of them were sug-
gestive, that is, of the possible
thief. - • Some ■ names given are:
Wotta Itch,. Heeza Under, Fuller
Ham, and Mister Going.
Mr. Oping is especially watched
because, of the time of the year.
Hooda himself said, “I don’t miss
the ‘W’ so much as though I would
miss’it if I wasn’t looking to .loose
it when I missed it if I could but
get a substitute, and forget about
it.”......................
It is very trying..
Hooda’s. uncle, I Mita Kriownut,
wrote Hooda about the affair. He
wrote:
“Dear Hooda:
“So some one has stolen your ‘W.’
I heard at first that this might make
you leave school/.but have since
heard that it will not. I want you
to know that I ani 'sorry.

• will cover Big Ten football completely and thoroughly.
Each game will be reported by veteran writers who
know the game from its every angle.
To really know what is going on in Big Ten grid-
iron circles you must read the sporting pages of the
Chicago Evening American every day.

* No newspaper in the west maintains a larger staff
of football writers than the Chicago Evening American.
Big Ten activities are reported by Harold Johnson and
“Chuck” McGuire. Eastern football is covered by
Eddie Mahan, former Harvard star. And Knute
Rockne, famous Notre Dame coach, writes on “inside
football.” His articles are appearing now on the sport-
ing pages and are of interest to fans and players alike.
