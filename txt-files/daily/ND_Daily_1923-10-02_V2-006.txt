“HELLO, MEN!”
“Hello, men.” :
The campus rang with hellos sung by smiling Notre Dame men
yesterday—that is,.it should have rung. -
” For the most part, it did. Most men, especially the older, men
greeted everyone-with a cheery salutation, but there were grumpy meii
who.passed solemn-faced, unheeding; probably engrossed in some deep
problem that would revolutionize the world.
These grumpy sages are not Notre Dame men. They are men that
merit the laving influence of the lake.
If7 they pass by you today, and do not respond to your “Hello,’
call out a louder “Hello” as they pass, and perhaps the sage will feel
small and will vouchsafe a reluctant “Hello.” Perhaps^ he may even
volunteer the first “Hello” to the next man he meets. .	•
And if you are one of the men who does not say “Hello,” recast the
above paragraph so that it hits you. And begin to say “Hello.”
;Even viewed from a purely utilitarian standpoint, saying ’Hello”
it.worthwhile. The combination of smiles and greetings makes you feel
' better inside—and even grumpy sages like to feel well inside.
ON AN OLD SUBJECT h
This editorial should be a pbem?; But poems come from poets, and
^editorials come from would-be editors. Nevertheless it is concerned
with nothing more than sentiment,.a feeling; its message will not move
the faculty mind, nor stir’the campus tongue, yet if it brush one bit of
dust from the conduit between two hearts/ it will indeed have, been a
message. z	.
-Friendship is a rare thing—not acquaintanceship, nor liking, nor
the glamour of personality which sometimes joins two men .in mutual
attraction; not any of these, but that kinship of hearts’which makes the
joys of one the joys of the other, and the least pain of one the greatest
pain of the other. It is really love, but when it exists between men, we
call it, in our. shy way, only friendship. ‘ ’ 7	7
At college we are thrown amongst men; jwe live with them, we
strive with them, we laugh'with them-—and sometimes .we have shed a
tear with them. We are-young, and they are young; our hopes are
great, and just as great our tolerance of little faults in others. As
surely as God is in His heaven, the delicate flowers of friendship will
poke /their heads somewhere in-this fertile field. And _if they do—if
in the garden of your heart you wake some morning to find'a timid bud
that scarcely ./knows its name, guard it with , all your soul, nourish it
*intb bloom. If frost comes/ shield the flower with the cloak of humility;
if "vyinds would mangle its tender petals erect around it the stern bar-
rier. of- self-sacrifice;-and if the roots of "the flower itself would dry up
in a sudden despair, water them with, tears. It may be friendship;
and if it is/ you are a. rich; man; you have not in vain come to-Notre
'Dame. ■ •	■	'	. .r' .	■
It looks very queer. It looks too
large, to be true. We asked him
where he got it. ■ Hooda blushed,
stepped on his right foot with his
left, placed his finger in his mouth
and said, “I dowanna tell.” We
asked, “Is it a cheap ‘W’?”
“Nothing is cheap at our house,”
he said.
“Since you left?” we suggested,
and walked away.
We had .walked scarcely a .block,
stopping only to tip our hat to a
freshman, when our glance rested
on the sidewalk. There was broken
glass and rubbish on the sidewalk.
Our glance glanced upward and
there, we read,
Dance Hall.”

E MAKING SPIRIT
’ /’■ When the new hall planned for freshmen is built on the campus
. next spring, it is expected that no freshmen will remain in'town. If
the endowment campaign continues to be successful, it is said that the
hall is assured.	;
The housing of the freshman class on the campus is joyous news.
It proclaims a great stride toward the Greater.Notre Dame, a Notre
Dame in which every man lives on the campus, where distractions are
few and the aim is one—where men, are united in purpose, and spirit in
an atmosphere like the ideal atmosphere of the old colleges,; Oxford,
Cambridge, and the Sourbonne. With all the men on the campus, Notre
Dame’s spirit would become universal, stronger, better.
z /" . Every man, not excluding five hundred as now, would be one of the
great Notre Dame family.	'	'	' •

„ NOTRE} DAME DAILY

From Off Stage
When you go to the Palace this
' week will see as good a comedy
as has been shown in these parts
for some time past. Buster Keaton
is as unsmiling as ever in “The
iphree Ages,” which tells the story
of love through the ages.
Ted Lorraine and Jack Minto, the
headliners, were well received in
a dancing act which left little to
he desired in the way of talent and
entertainment. Marie Andre, who
appeared with them, was graceful
• and lithe in her offerings. The fea-
tures of the act were the' Apache
dance, done to “Mon Homme,” and
the. moth and flame opus which
closed it.	• , ’
< . Callahan and Bliss, in the roles
„ of small town sports, gave a series
of characterizations, all of which
were well received. Edward J. Lam-
bert and Miss Minnie Fish scored
the hit of the afternoon in a turn
in which he kept the audience in
continual merriment. The Cavanna
Trio opened the bill with a circus
in which they sang a bit, danced a
bit, and did some extraordinary
tumbling and contortions. Seigel
and Irving, “the Roman Gladia-
tors,” provided a good closing num-
ber with their exhibition of acro-
batic feats.
: Tt is, from start to finish, a‘good
program which will provide a pleas-
ant afternoon for the .hardworking
student.	' .
JUNIOR DANCE
PLANS DECIDED
Eddie Luther Featured in Songs;
Orchestra and Other Novelties
’To Be Announced.
Cheer Leader Eddie Luther in a
cycle of popular songs will be one
of the feature and innovations of
the Junior Football Dance to be
held Saturday, October 6, it was
announced yesterday by the com-
mittee in charge. The Juniors have
several ‘‘novelties • planned that will
be announced later in the week. It
is the intention of those in charge
to make this informal one of’ the
most memorable affairs of the fall
social season, and no effort is be-
ing spared in preparation. This
year’s junior class will be remem-
bered for the Cats Pajamas novelty
of the sophomore football dance of
last year.
According to George Sheehe,
chairman of the committee in
charge, the place and the music for
the junior dance have not been def-
initely decided upon, due to a. con-
sideration of several outside orches-
tras. Complete plans for the dance
will be given out in a short time.
