may be presented to further the
cause of the missions.
The 'detailed rules- of the drama
contest follow:
1.	Every, play must be the or-
iginal work of the person submit-
ting it and must never have been
staged-nor printed. However, col-
laboration oftvo or more persons

ly typewritten on one side of the
paper, with numbered sheets, and

ited to any particular dramatic
form. One-act plays, full-length
plays, fantasies, serious plays; or
comedies may be submitted.
4.	The subject matter must, be
in, some way connected with the
Catholic mission. It may repre-
sent life in the missions, with dra-
matic episodes either from the lives
of natives, Christian , or pagan, or
of missionaries, either historical or
fictional. It may' represent the
mission spirit of those at home who;
are working for the' missions. But
it should create interest in the mis-
sions,? either J?y;;picturipg ^ dra-
.-maticallyy or-rmriking; a-dramatic^ ap£.
peal for them.. ‘	'
5.	The plays will be judged ac-
cording' to -their correctness of
/dramatic form, that is, according to
the recognized standards of play
structure: They will also be judged
by the truth and dramatic quality
of their . subjects. The subjects
should be true to life, dramatic in
their nature, and with a genuine
appeal to the emotions of the audi-
ence., ' -' • • ■ ■'	■ '	. - '

QUESTIONNAIRE
WHAT : A.SKED: What year
do~you think Notre Dame turned
out the.best baseball team?
. WHERE ASKED: On the cam-
pus : .
. PAUL ROMWEBER, Litt. B.
Ill, Badin: The best baseball team
in my time was the team of 1921.
Kiley and Mohardt were playing a
big league: brand of ball and the
season was a successful ■ one, for
only six games were lost.
JOHN DUGAN, Law IV,. Badin:
The teairi of 1921 was our best year
for baseball. Every; man. ;on the
club was hitting the ball and they
were as . classy a bunch of ball play-
ers as were ever assembled at any
college.
WILLIAM SHEEHAN, Comm.
IV, Sorin: With respect to.results
the best team we’ve had was the
club of 1922. They did not have
the stars of the previous year, but
there was more harmony and a’bet-
ter fighting spirit in evidence.
Their'record shows that they were
defeated'but four, tinies/and they
won 18 games.
REV. JAMES CALLAGHAN, C.
S. C.:- The tearii that we/had in
1901 was. the best that we have ever
turned out. They won the Western,
championship, by defeating Michi-
gan twice, and they had such men
living the highest number of votes (as Angus McDonald and “Peaches?’
c°mpete for the office’, in a final iO’Neil playing.'

Despite the change in the weath-
er which was accompanied by a
light drizzle, Coach George Keo-
gan’s baseball squad. continued its
outdoor practice work. The out-
fielders corralled flyballs and later
the infield took a fast workout in
shifts. a
; Intensive drill still continues *to
employ the football candidates and
Coach Rockne directed the oack-
field men through a strenuous ses-
sion of signal formations, kicking

Notre Dame Post Office Dates Back to ;
Civil War Days; Interesting Facts Given
• An interesting feature Aof the
campus .for study is the post-office.
The present building was built nine
years ago, but an office has been
established at Notre . Dame since
Civil War days, when' the Indians
were still proihinent throughout the
middle west. ' '
Brother Theogene, C. S. C.; is
the .postmaster, at the little campus
station, and Brothers' Marcellinus,
C.' S. C., and Anselm, C. S. G., are
the assistants. ’ Brother Theogene
has held his.position for about seven
years, . and the assistants have
worked under him for.the past three
years. '. ' •
Being distant' from a railroad,
the ;mail is received, from and sent
out three times. daily and once on
Sunday by means' of trucks from
South Bend. The post office de-
partment at Washington refuses to
allow the amount of incoming mail
to be published, and no exact fig-
ures of out-going mail can be se- j
cured. However/ it is estimated
that an average of 12,0Q0 letters
are .mailed at the. university post
office every week. Ten magazines
are* ‘ published upon ‘ the campus,
viz.: Juggler, St. Mary’s Chimes,
University 'Bulletin, Santa1 Maria,
Alumnus, Annals of Lourdes; Ariier-
ican Midland Naturalist, Scholastic,
Notre Dame DAILY, and 500 sacks,
are required to dispatch .parcel post'
and magazines weekly, and the av-
erage total'weight is /6,000 pounds.
Sacks of magazines are1 dispatched
weekly to ..every stdtein'the Union,
Cariada, Europe, the Philippines,
and. far-away Australia. The aver-
age number of laundry cases sent
from the university is 700 weekly,
and approximately; 40,000 parcels
are handled annually. /
.Besides the- mail of the college,
the campus post j office/ handles all
of St. Mary’s mail, and-, also the
mail of the residents' of Alorning
Side, the addition /ri the rear of the
ball park. /
.. At a meeting of the S. A. C. car-
nival coihmittee, held Thursday

ONCE MORE TO THE BREACH!
There they are, hovering only a few days off—in fact they are
almost upon us, and. we have not started to put into effect the good
resolutions we made after the last examinations. So it goes. Blame it
on the flesh^the spirit was willing. Even at this late hour though,
there is' stilbtime to rouse ourselves into a semblance of preparedness.
Wednesday is the first examination day—that gives us the week-end
for preparation. Surely much can be done over a week-end, -when we
consider the almost impossible tasks usually accomplished on the night
preceding the examination. Let us try. to make use of this bit of time
then—it may help keep the electric light bill from going over the top
again.as it usually does during examination week.
b V,, BEHIND THE SCENES .
; When _we are praising the successful efforts of the Monogram men
in staging their recent ’show~~and theTsuccesses achieved by other local
thespians in putting on performances of: various kinds in Washiilgton
--Hally we are~ inclined sometimes," to forget" the work of the men wKo
should share the honor—the stage hands—the men who arrange scenes,
curtains, props, and lights. These, are the men really behind the show.
For the most part their work is gratuitous-—they give time and energy
that others; may receive applause. At nearly all the rehearsals these
men must be on hand. Everything must go like clock-work. While
we are, sitting out in. front on the night of the show waiting and chat-
'ting, a few men are behind stage shifting scenes, arranging props,
■taking care of curtains, carefully watching lights, and doing all'this
with a maximumiof speed and minimum of noise. It is no soft job,
no enjoyable evening for them. And when the show is a success they
are satisfied—and forgotten. . It is platitudinous to say “good work
fellows,” but many times the platitude expresses the idea perfectly.
DEMOCRACY AND EDUCATION
With the. growth of-interest in political campaigns the word’ “de-
. mocracy” is employed frequently. Everyone, it seems, is for democ-
racy. Nevertheless there is at some times some disagreement,-and at
all times much misunderstanding, as to, the proper definition of the
word. Broadly speaking; however, it may be said that democracy
implies that the mass of the people of a nation have the political
control, in. their own hands;	. ;
\ ; But if-it be assumed that the people are to. control the government
it must “also be assumed that they must have the proper knowledge to
guide them in the exercise of such control; . It is for this'reason that
•education becomes the.important thing'thatTtisHn any country having
a popular form bf government. And democracy; in. a given country
must be. looked upon as an experiment until the citizens have proved
their possession of the necessary political knowledge.
Thus Dr. Alexander Meiklejohn, while, speaking at Northwestern
universityj isaid:. <	:
^“The question-before us today is not, shall we attempt democ-
' racy, but how shall we attempt democracy. ; Democracy is possible if
. ,. education is possible. What power does voting give to those who do not
know? .Voting does not give understanding. You cannot guide unless
you understand where’you are going. We do not have more democracy
in America because no matter how much we may vote, we may have
only a partial education.” /	* • I	/
By “partial education” the speaker must Haye meant not so much
that some citizens, are , uneducated, as that even the educated citizens
frequently lack the knowledge required for-an intelligent participation
in governmental control. That such knowledge is something more than
mere academic training is shown by the fact thit many college men do
'.not display the-political common sense that .might reasonably be ex-
pected of any voter;'	-	i: -
<	■ Such knowledge rather implies a real conception of the true nature
-	. of. political-authority, of the obligations which test upon those who are
in possession of political power, and of the .duty of the electorate to
interest itself in the. problem of maintaining good government. So it
is not for-the college graduate to rest-secure in tlie belief that education
alone makes the ideal citizen. Education, however, does bring many
• advantages, and the truly patriotic individualism see that these ad-
vantages, are used to develop that political sense that must be the dis-
tinguishing mark of the best citizen. -	7 . Y ,	...

Let us prescribe “A Society

nui. This is a production that we

Gloria Swanson blooms again in
gowns more stunning than ever,
and adds some .unusually clever act-
ing to her work as a mannequin.
In addition, Rod la Roque affords
the men an interesting study of the
latest in tweeds and worsteds. This
inoyie has a good plot, very clever
sub-titles, and is on the whole one
of the finest we have seen in some
time.
This brings us to the Watson
sisters. Fanny is fat, and gets
many a laugh by naively admitting
it, in about fifty-seven different
ways, and Kitty has a soothing
voice. They deserve their extended
applause.	P. C. M.

Next Year What ?
COMMENCEMENT days are not far off. They will be here sooner than you realize.
What’s ahead of you? Will you spend next year as an apprentice in business, or will
you use it to fit yourself, for leadership. In a few years some of your class will be
influential leadersoccupying'po sit ions. .of.. great_responsibility; pthers_wilkbe placedin__-
-minor roles--living from hand to moufh.'Thus far you have made a splendid investment
of your time. What .will you do now? Have you chosen business for your life work? If
so, and if you seek leadership in the commercial world, here are facts worthy of your,
deepest consideration.'
The principles of leadership in busi-
ness are not many in number. They are
not hard to grasp. Yet less than two
men in a hundred ever learn them.
The two chief reasons for this fail-
ure are: (1)—lack of an all-’round
business experience. (2) — the diffi-
culty of drawing sound conclusions
■ from the relatively few experiences
that any one person can have.
A Study of Leaders
Through your studies thus far you
have created for yourself a substantial
background—a foundation upon uhicli
you can build high. Why not use this
foundation in the largest possible way?
‘ If you are truly ambitious for steady
and permanent progress, it will be well
for you—in addition to* your under-
ducted for the purpose of training
young men who are to occupy posi-
tions of'responsibility and trust.
This Laboratory Method
Since it is the purpose of Babson In-
stitute to train men for business, all
work and all study is conducted in the
Game manner as work is conducted in
any regularly established - business
house. For instance, there are regu-
lar office hours not merely school hours.
Lessons and reports are dictated by the
. student' as in an office—not written.
Thus, the student acquires a mastery
of business English and the ability to<
transform quickly his thoughts into de-
finite form.	• -. >

NOTRE DAME GETS
1924 STATE MEET
TRACK CLASSIC FOR MAY 24
FEATURES SENIOR
BALL WEEK
The pick of Indiana’s track stars
will compete for the state title on
Cartier field May 24, according to
an announcement made by Coach
Rockne..
The Indiana- intercollegiate meet,
which will be a feature of Senior
week, has become one of the most
popular sporting
state and with the
tion of the track
state schools, the
events of the
general perfec-
iriaterial in the
meet this year
with stars and
should be replete
record-breaking competition. But-
ler and Wabash are doped to hold
a prominent place in the meet -and
will be pointed to ’ break Notre
Dame’s string of title victories.
Neither Purdue nor Indiana have
been represented by overly well
balanced track teams this season,
but it is certain that the confer-
ence schools will contribute a few
stars to' the cinder caucus. Al-
though Notre Dame’s championship
team was somewhat depleted by
graduation last year, the showing
of the 1924 squad in the Wisconsin
meet was far above what the ma-
jority of the local track followers
had hoped for. , The Irish will be
well fortified in the halfmile, mile
and two mile events.' McTiernan,
who set a hew indoor gym record
this year, will undoubtedly be able
to trim his outdoor figure a few
seconds. A :49 quarter, turned in
by John Montague in the meet at
Purdue last season, saved the title
, for Notre Dame.
The state meet, which was insti-
tuted in 1914, has been won by
Notre Dame every year since 1915,
Purdue winning the initial meet.
Notre Dame played host to the state
classic in 1921.
’ PHARMACY BASEBALL

partment of the university.have or-

Spring Training May 3
All the conventions of the grid-
iron sport will be shattered this
year at the close of the spring foot-
ball session when the veterans and
the hopefuls line up for the kick-
off on Cartier field May 3.
The spring game is a usual fea-
ture of the spring practice session,
and. the new candidates after ab-
sorbing the fundamentals of the
game during the previous weeks of
training, are given their first test
under fire. The recruits at pres-
ent are under the tutelage of Coach
Rockne and several of the men
from the 1923 team are assisting
in shaping, the large squad for the
more strenuous work which will be-
inaugurated as the training sessions
proceed. For the past few nights,
Rockne has given the candidates for
the line positions individual instruc-
tions.
Carroll Champs Are
Honored by Lettermen
As a fitting climax to a success-
ful season, the Carroll hall basket-
ball squad was given a four-course
banquet by the Monogram club in
the banquet room of Clark’s cafe-
teria at 7 o’clock Thursday even-
ing.
Father Devers and Father Holde-
rith ! addressed a few remarks to
the., players, congratulating them
on the success they had achieved
during the past season, and com-
mending them for their sportsman-
ship. Tom Goss and several mem-
bers of the team, including Captain
McNally, were also included on the
speaking program. The following
men attended the dinner: V. Mc-
Nally, Kirwan, Maxwell, Howard,
Herbert, Dahman, Lloyd, Boland,
O’Neill, Sullivan and Favero.

PRINCETON TIGERS
GET GRIDIRON CALL
FIFTY CANDIDATES REPORT
TO ROPER; SQUAD HAS
MANY VETERANS
Coach Bill Roper, issuing his
first summons for spring football
practice found 50 candidates for
the 1924 Princeton football team
waiting to start the informal funda-
mental practice work preparatory
to building up a winning gridiron
eleven for the coming season.
The first day’s work, -which in-
formally dedicated *a new practice
field, was limited to limbering up
exercises and a few primary tactics
as*'the prologue to the strenuous
program that has been mapped out
for the Tiger gridders this spring.
Every position except right tackle
will be contended for by a letter
man next fall.- Graduation last
year removed some of the stars
from the Princeton team, but Roper
has- a squad of veterans left with
which to’build his 1924 aggrega-
tion. Captain Stout and several
veterans from other years were out
in uniform to assist Roper in get-
ting the spring work under way.
Roper and Van Gerbig, stellar half
back of 1923, gave particular atten-
tion to the backfield candidates.
COACH YOST TO REFEREE

PURPLE GOLFERS
MEET IRISH, MAY 11
LOCAL GOLFERS PROPOSE
STUDENT MEMBERSHIP AT
CHAIN-’O-LAKES
Because of great delay exper-
ienced in completing negotiations
with several western universities,
the Notre Dame golf team has not
been able to issue a full schedule
for the coming season. The officers
of the club announced this week
that a date had been settled with
Northwestern for May 10, when the
Purple will meet the locals on the
Chain-o’-Lakes course. This date
conflicts with the dual track meet
with Illinois on Cartier field, but
it was the only open date that the
Evanston school could offer to the
local club.
With the exception of Ray Bart-
zen, the entire squad of last year
remains intact and; the prospects
for the. 1924 season are more than
ordinarily bright. The withdrawal
of Bartzen from school will be a
serious loss to the team, but it is
expected that from the long list of
candidates who tried out for the
team last year several players will
be found to strengthen the team. "/
The officers of the club are also
endeavoring to introduce a student
membership in the Chain-o’-Lakes
Golf association. The proposal has
already been placed before the di-
rectors of the club and an answer
is expected very shortly.

However, the Municipal links will

par is reduced from 36 to 30. A

Plans are now being formulated

PAUW PICKS KIZER
Noble
Kizer, 'stellar Irish basket-
eer, was chosen all-western guard
oh the mythical ’ five of “Brick”
Young, a leading Big Ten official.
Kizer also made the second team on
“The Depauw’s” all-western quin-
tet. Paul Cook, who made the se-
lection, has this to say about Kizer:
“Kizer of Notre Dame is one of
the most brilliant players in the
mid-west and his coming season as
captain of the Irish five will be
watched with interest.”

Interesting Number
of Catalyzer Is Out
The latest number of the Cat-

campus early this week. The Cat-
alyzer is the monthly magazine
edited: and published by members
of the Chemists’ club at Notre
Dame, with Paul F. De Paolis, Ch.
E.-, ’24, as editor-in-chief.
i The leading article in the pres-
ent number is entitled “A Process
for ,-the Manufacture of , Paralde-
hyde,” by Richard R. Vogt. This
article is a short but interesting ac-
count of the preparation of paral-
dehyde as a proposed commercial
process.’ Mr.' Herman H. Wenzke,
professor in the department of
chemistry, is the author of an arti-
cle on “A Course in the Principles
of Chemical Engineering,” outlin-
ing the course pursued-.by students
at Notre Dame in securing a degree-
in chemical engineering.
