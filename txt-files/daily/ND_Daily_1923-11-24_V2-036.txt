ham, .head of: the Department, of.

subjects. //He 'stated, that the, last

process of . specialization for; any

may desire .to take up in later life.
. - /“First get a general' fund ? of .
knowledge—a bird’s eye view of
the sciences—and :then specialize in

GIVEN CREDIT
FOR MIRACLES
Marvelous Cures. Credited to Bro.
Columba; Fostered Devotion
to Sacred Heart.
j ' Several years ago the South Bend
News-Times carried an’ article in
which the story, of miraculous cures’
attributed t;o. Bro.... Columba, just
dead, were; told. The article , began
by telling of his long hours of
prayer at the shrine of the ’ Sacred
Heart in the old log ' chapel near
St. Mary’s lake and continued as
follows:	•;	, /-
Three years ago there came to
Brother Columba ; in . his cobbler
shop a man. from Lakeville with" an
order? for a pair of .shoes ;tp be
made for his son, a cripple. . ;/ '
■ “Why don’t you take the boy to
Chicago’,’’"asked Brother Columba,
“and have the’"shoes .made there?
Maybe you could" have something
done for the boy there, too.”
“I can’t afford, it,: brother,” re-
plied the man. ...“It-takes all I can
save to take care Tof /a. sick girl I
have. I’ve paid hundreds/of dol-
lars out for her/now,' but nothing
seems to do heir any good.J She has
convulsions.” i: . -
So Brother Columba took the or-
der for the slioes and.as. the man
was leaving the shop ’ Handed him
a small badge'"or/~^
upon it the .'Jikeriess ?6f' ‘.£ner Sacred
Heart. ;7. '._'/// //	’/'77.

Tech Gridders Prepared: for Hard
Game With Irish; Big Ten ;
Finals Today. , /
Notre Dame arrived in the Smoky
City early yesterday morning and
will take a light workout today in
preparation for their game with the
Tech gridders this afternoon. .:
B oth teams are well prepare d for
the encounter, with the exception'
that Don Miller will be out of the
line-up. The easterners are primed '
to the fighting pitch and will meet
the Benders with a determined re-
sistance and flashy attack with
which, they hope to duplicate the
feat, of Nebraska.
AU available tickets are reported '
■to: be sold and hundreds will be
clamoring for a place in Forbes field
to see the Fighting Irish on their
hist'eastern appearance for the sea-
son. The Notre Dame student body
will be in Pittsburg this; morning.'
3’r eie also will be a large, delega-
tion.on hand from Youngstown, 0.,
to honor Harvey Brown, captain of
the ; Notre - Dame: eleven, and who •
lives at Youngstown.
Today will be the pigskin climax -
to. a brilliant college football sea- .
son,: a season that has .been replete
with upsets and surprises. The big. .
headliners in the East this afternoon
will be the Yale-Harvard. Ai’my-
Navy and Nebf askarSyfacuse;
games. The moleskin warriors fiom
Old Eli are doped to win from the
Boston fishermen by a fair margin.
Yale : has a wondec backfield; and
presents;an/attack that will -dazzle ..
the Harvard aggregation with speed: /
and power. . The Army has a slight
edge on the .Navy, but;the superb
resistance ■. offered by the sailors .
last year..will be remembered and
with ,the priceless honor that will
be at stake today, the Navy is apt
to be the “fly in the Mule’s' oint-
ment.’’. .?■
7 The: cadet's .have, learned a great :
deal of football since their encoun-:
ters with Notre Dame and Yale, and
their appreciation of ; the :. Notre
Dame style of football can easily
be. ascertained. with the invitation
from West Point to Coach Rockne
of Notre Dame to spend a few’days'
at the Hudson river football camp,
giving the pointers a few points on ’
the versatile attack that the Irish
employed against the Cadets; on
Ebbets field.	■_.< 7
.: Nebraska will stack up against
the mighty Syracuse team. in . an-
other .intersectional.battle/this aft-:
ernoon.. Syracuse has been defeated
once this season in one of the 1923
upsets, when Colgate romped over
them .16 ; to 0. •. Nebraska upset
Notre Dame in another surprise
blow, and today’s game between the,
Huskers and ! Syracuse wiU be a
crucial struggle with a great repu-
tation at stake.
/ In the middlewest the “struggle '
of the ages” will be fought out at
Ann: Arbor when the- Wolverines:
and Minnesota meet with the Big.
Ten; title . at stake. Michigan's ^
chances of remaining jn. the .race
are hanging on a thread, with Illi-,
nois, the other contender for the .
title, playing the . Wilcemen > from
Ohio State. Minnesota was held to
a scoreless tie by the. Badgers, and;
this afternoon will make .their last
desperate attempt to hold their
place among the runners up in the ,.
conference. N	'
’/ Michigan’s eleven is in a very bad :	'
way physically, with only-five reg-
ulars , in the line-up. Minnesota

Palace-^—The Fair Cheat. .
AT THE BLACKSTONE.
The plot of “Times Have
Changed” is, with all due apology
to the originator of the expression,
"pure, unadulterated, viciously con-
cocted bunk.” It is an admixture
of ancestor worship, Plymouth
Rockism. high school flapper, and
bandits.	.
William Russell in “Times Have
Changed,” is Mark O’Rell, a hero
of Chateau Thierry, who marries a
member of an aristocratic Long
Island family. The family insists
that he-maintain their traditions,
and'lie finds himself the incumbent
of a position for which he has nb
great liking—that of, principal, of
the Wynwood high school. He-goes
to New York to recover a crazy
quilt under which ten of his wife’s
ancestors have died and begins a
attractive, was the girl in “The
Fair Cheat.” Wilfred Lytell. was
the man. Edmund Breese also was
in the cast. -
The picture concerns the love af-
fair of a young man with the daugh-
ter of his boss. The boss believes
that the marriage would not be a
success because his daughter is ac-
customed to spend much money/ sb
he planned to • test his • daughter’s
ability to live on less money, and at
;the' same time to test her suitor.
“You must earn your own living
for a year,” he told her, “and at
the end'of that time you may mar-
ry anyone you- choose.” “You iriust
marry within six months' or; you
lose your job,” he told the young
man, but he did not tell -him that
he and: his daughter were not go-
ing to Europe as was announced/
but that, on the contrary,. she would
stay in New York. \	•■ ■
After that the plot is, envolved,
and it would not7 do to outline it
all, but it develops some delicate sit-
uations for the young man who de-
nies his love >for the rich girl wheri
he- becomes in love with the seem-
ingly poor girl. ■ After it is all over
he says that he was wise to the sit-
uation all the time. “The big, brave
hero must not be thought to have
been boobed,” one competent com-
mentator remarked.

WHERE THE KLAN FAILS.
(New York Times) 7	,
. -. Northward .the star of invisible’
empire takes its way. The center,
of gravity of the Ku Klux Klan has
shifted J from- Atlanta to -Dallas/ and:
thence ;to Indianapolis. '.Out! in In-
diana everybody seems to belong/
Easterners have been surprised at
the ready conquest by the Klan of
a State which-seemed of all'our 48:
the least imperiled by any kind of
alien menace.' Mr. Lowell-Mellett
tells us in The • Atlantic that the
Klan in” Indiana is' primarily an
: anti;Catholic organization, and that
the wildest, tales of papal plots are
readily believed by apparently sari'e
citizens. This is not quite what we
expected-- of -Indiana;- Has the- in-
• dolent ‘geniality!of the Hoosier been
drilled out. of. them by the stern
philosophy.of Nordic/Protestantism?
7 We doubt it. For it must be
observed that .the Indiana Klan has
dodged the .ch’ief . domestic challenge
to Protestant supremacy. There is
in . Indiana fa militant Catholic or-
ganization,' composed‘ 'of men spe-
cially chosen for..strength, courage1
.and resourcefulness.'.. These de-!
voted warriors lead, a, life.; of almost
monastic . asceticism, under, .stern
military discipline. They are con-
stantly engaged in secret ' drills?
They- make long cross-country raid-
ing expeditions. • They, have shown
their prowess on many battlefields.
Worst of1, all, 'they lately, fought,
and decisively defeated, a detach-
ment of- the jUnited . States Army.

diana Klansmen rising up to ex-
terminate the' Nbtre Dame football

-'On the contrary; all'. Indiana,
Catholic and, Protestant, seems to
regard it as a valuable .asset, an ir-

The New York University News
gathered statistics on the reading
favorites at the uniyersity last
week. The figures show that stu-
dents in a management class liked
Sinclair Lewis best. Next to him
they named. Fanny , Hurst, . and
Zane Grey each receiving a- like
number of. votes,
; Students in a Journalism class
indicated that they preferred au-
thors who wrote along a different
line. They named John Gals-
worthy, A. S. M. Hutchinson, Rup-
ert Hughes, and Christopher Mor-
ley.	.
Greek students indicated that
they were interested in authors who
wrote in a serious vein. H. G.
jWells, Anatole France, and Joseph
,Conrad were named.
Love of adventure and, satire was
noted from the authors chosen by
members of an Accounting class.
They named Louis Vance, Joseph
Conrad, and Bernard Shaw as the
authors they liked best to read..'
Opinions were next obtained
from an' English class. These stu-
dents selected F. Scott Fitzgerald,
and Warner Fabian as their leading
authors. '	,.	,

The girl wore the badge as she
was bidden. The ’ convulsions
ceased and in three years have
never returned.
“I thought nothing of that, then,”
says Brother Columba. “I thought
it was just one case in a hundred.
Then I knew of a man up in Can-
<ada who had been a cripple for
years. He walked on crutches. I
sent him one of the badges and
prayed as I had done for the little
.girl, and, do you know,” and the old
'brother’s eyes lighted up,-“it wasn’t
long before he sent me his crutches.
He didn’t need them any more. I
gave the crutches to a man on
-Thomas street in South Bend. He
has been crippled up with rheuma-
tism for a long time, so crippled
that he couldn’t leave his: bed. • Now
he is walking with the crutches, and
he expects to do without those be-
fore long.’’;:
These were but the first iof a re-
markable series of cures which
Brother? Columba attributes to de-
votion to the Sacred Heart. ,
t. The fame of his cures has spread
far • and Sunday after Sunday his
shop is filled with visitors, come on
their own behalf or on behalf of a
relative or* friend for whom . they
seek the old man’s prayers, and he
receives letters from all oyer .the
country acknowledging the efficacy

of his prayers. Some days he has
received as. high as six of such ac-
knowledgments/.
Some time ago he heard of the
case of a young girl in Iowa, who
had not walked for seven years.
She suffered from a spinal trouble,
which caused her back to be mis-
shapen - and - her legs to be useless.
Brother : Columba sent - her . the
badge,: and one; morning the girl
astonished • her family by rising
from her bed and walking about
her room.	-
It was only a few weeks ago that
Brother Columba read in the paper
of the case of. a child in Ohio who
had been bitten by a mad dog and
was, dying.
Hope had been given up by the
attending physicians^ Brother
Columba hastily dispatched to the
mother a Sacred Heart badgej ex-
plained to her his.purpose in send-
ing. it, and: telling her of other
cures. Several days later he re-,
ceived, a letter. “My daughter .is
on the road to recovery,” it read.
“You have saved her life.” .'
. Several cases of insanity are said
to have been; cured by the old man’s
prayers, two or three cases of can-
cer, and a multiplicity of lesser ail-
ments. '
