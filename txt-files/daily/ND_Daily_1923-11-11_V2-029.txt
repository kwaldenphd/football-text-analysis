LINCOLN, Neb., Nov. 10.—Nebraska, 14; Notre Dame, 7, is the story
of one of the most bitter upsets that ever came to the Irish football
camp, when the Cornhuskers defeated Notre Dame in the new Nebraska
stadium at Lincoln before a record-breaking crowd of 30,000.	.-.t , ..
.Notre Dame fought the westerners to the last second of play and
displayed their undaunted spirit by scoring a'touchdown as the final
whistle sounded, bringing to a close one of the hardest fought battles
in football history.	Y	'	. -	.'
The Cornhuskers had a wonderful team that played the game "as
they never played it before. Not once did they, let up on their'smashing
line attack, and with the advantage of weight, they crushed'the Irish
defense. ’ ' ' ■ ■ . ■ ■ '' . ■ ’
\ One of the surprises of the struggle was the inability of Notre Dame
to complete forward passes. The passing game has been used with much
success by Notre Dame this' year, and other seasons, but Coach Dawson
of Nebraska, had evidently perfected an effective defense. Notre Dame •
attempted 37 passes and completed
only. 12 for a total of 155 yards.
Nebraska completed but two of its
nine passes, but one of them, a
short.toss to Noble,.on the 20-yard
line, resulted -in a touchdown.
The Cornhuskers’ tremendou
power was manifested in: the vici-
ous line smashing game that paved
the way for sensational victory over
the Rockmen yesterday. ; The. cen-
ter trio of the Irish line,, Walsh,
Brown and Kizer was subjected to
INTERVALE GRIDDERS. .
The Badin, hall football team left
for Portland, Ind'.,-yesterday after-;
noon to play Our Boys team of
Portland. Our Boys are the light-’
weightchamps of. Indiana.1 The
Day Dogs will play Sophomore hall
on Cartier field this afternoon. .

The?Nb'tieTDame~iootball-:ieaTunviiat
it is today,, these brilliant and .en-
during ,. warriors never faltered
from their task' and. even; when the
pall of defeat was' hanging oyer
them, they fought as ? no football
men . ever fought. before. Sharing
in the glory of these meh were
Oberst, .Rip Miller,. Joe Bach,
Crowe, Collins, Mayl, Hunsinger
and Murphy. ■	. v ' T ,	;
Against this forward .wall of the
Irish, which has made football his-
tory sparkle for the Hoosier school
this season, the greater part of the
westrener’s attack was ■ directed.
Through their supreme efforts were
the Benders enabled to march
steadily to. the enemy’s -goal, only
to have victory snatched from their
grasp by the breaks of - the game.
.. The Irish back field played a
fighting game and tore through the
Cornhuskers line and ran the ends
with lightning speed, but the. Ne-
braska team was tackling as mad
men and it was impossible to make
consistent gains against such des-
xperate. playing. Elmer . Layden
pierced the / heavy Nebraska line
for gains and Crowley and Miller
tore off tackle and around the ends.
Stuhldreher was throwing, and re-
ceiving passes and. running, back
punts for consistent : gains. Max
Hauser,', who went in late in 'the
game, passed with remarkable ac-
curacy and was responsible,- in a
great part, for Notre Dame’s touch-
down. Bergman and Maher, and
all of the -Irish backs , played-a
splendid game, ; but . breaks were
against’ them and they were play-
ing a team that had been especially
primed for the Notre Dame, attack.
The struggle between these two
great rivals was . won and lost. on
the breaks of the game. Two won-
derful teams pitted all they had
on The altar of-the pigskin for .that
priceless glorythat is : Nebraska’s
today. ;	’	“...... .
Notre Dame won the toss and
Layden kicked off. . Straight foot-
ball tactics, were used which failed
to gain for either side, and both
teams exchanged' punts. Lewellen
ran. back. Layden’s punt from his
own 30-yard line to the Irish 32-
the Cornhuskers were playing foot-
ball as they never played before. :
Within a few minutes after the
start of the second period, Noble-
raced around the . Irish flank for
24 yards, and a touchdown; guard-
ed by perfect interference. ' .
The Rockmen came back with - a
powerful ’ drive, mixing , a : running
game with a pass attack.. It was;
.a steady march down the field with'
Don Miller smashing the line for;.
six and . eight-yard, gains. Crow-
ley’s first pass was good- for .nine'.
-j^r.ds„and; aYfe>V7Seeofids laterj -MiI-;
ler took another. pass“ for rs6ven
yards..- ' ... <. '■	■	■
. Layden cared around the Corn-
huskers flank for 10 ;yards and was
hurt on the following play.. .With
Layden ba^k in the game The Irish:
rushed the ball to - the -shadow of
Nebraska .goal, but an incomplete
pass cost the Irish one of the best
chances they had to score. ;
The westerners punted out of
danger and for’ the remainder of
the period, the Cornhuskers bat-
tled -the Benders in their own ter-
ritory. In the first half, Notre
Dame was the heavy ground gain-
ers by passes and line smashing.
Yin the second half, the western-
ers': battered the center; of the
Irish line and Walsh, Brown and
Kizer fought the battle: of their
lives to stave of the attack of the
Huskers. "	Y "	-
. The Irish began another march
in the middle of the period with
passes and off tackle smashes. Lay-
den smashed center of the-enemy’s
line for eight arid nine yards at a
time. Stuhldreher, .the resource-
ful quarterback; completed a. beau-
tiful pass to Miller, .that: was .good
for 27. yards. Miller was hurt. on
the, play and. after returning, to the
game fumbled .on Nebraska’s 23-
yard line.. The ball .was. scooped up
by Rhodes, who • rah to ;thev Rock-
men’s five-yard , line. Here? they
were held for downs. Y’ ; ’ Y
Nebraska took1'the’ ball near the
close of the ■ quarter and- smashed
through -the', lirie. ' The ball* was
worked down to Notre Dame’s 19-
yard line- as The quarter ended. Y
With The ball on ; the;, Irish 19-
yard line,; arid fourth , dowri, nine’
to go, Nebraska passed and Noble
scored a touchdown.
> Both teams ,played a passing arid
running game till nearly the end
of the period, with the Cornhusk-
ers displaying, an uncanny .adriot-;
ness to intercept the Irish passes,
which, was one of the surprises of
the game:	: :
; Rockne: sent Cerney, Maher and
. Hauser into the ' backfield, and
Notre Dame took the ball on downs
after the Huskers had rushed in
yard. line. Layderi passed toYDon
Miller for a 10-yard- gain which
was the first: of the Rockmen’s'
aerial'1 attacks.’ Y -T. Y. '< ’	■
‘ The -first first period marked the
^opening of the terrific- battle "and
deep into the Irish territory. The
Fighting'Dockmen made brie of the
most sensational^struggles for a
score than has ‘ ever been witnessed
on the gridiron. , Y

AUTUMN '
, We. have something to look forward to. This is the time of year
when The Chicago Tribune reprints John McCutcheon’s perennially
popular cartoon, “Injun Summer,”: which we always cut out of the
paper and pin above our desk where it remains until an unusually
strong current of air makes it fall to the floor, and the Polish janitor,
altogether devoid of appreciation for the finer things of life, carries it
' but with yesterday’s papers; then we settle down to wait for the next
reprint,.	•	• .
An exhilarating season, this Indian Summer—a time to be out of
•'doors, to stroll beside the hazy lake at dusk when shadows deepen
from purple to black and gradually.merge into a sable sheen reflecting
_the.glow of the golden dome.. - ?	;
; . The moon-rises, .and its light , is pearl and smoke about the trees.
Dead leaves, yellow and'red, fall slowly in the windless air; the
•November; mist; frames the distant woodlands in vignettes, opalescent
•in the . faded light. -Here and there, men'with rakes in their hands,
-tend bon. fires, their shadows dancing fantastically on the ground.
The frost lays its white finger on the; earth; the stars look down and
see it in-its shroud, ,	.	; ... .	.... ./......
It is autumn. ’	•	. .

I found this in a bit of book

NOTRE DAME SPIRIT
. . . Is the .traditional- spirit on the wane? Are Notre Dame men
\^b'ecomingljjrtef cake/eaters vand lounge, lizards,; men who prefer

The demonstration of welcome for the Purdue team was notice-
ably’short on pep. The men didn’t turn out as in former years, and
there were a mere handful in the snake-dance—perhaps three hundred
men, optimistically estimated. j'	.'
/ It was certainly due.to no defection bn the part of the committee
that arranged the reception. They did their best'to' make the, affair
a success,' and it was only through itheir efforts that there was" a recep-
tion at all.’ ’There were last minute delays, of course, whiqh may- or
.may no .have been unavoidable, but which certainly robbed the work
' . of the,committee .of much.of its fruits. Committees can only plan and
wofk;-andfth’ere are always those :’who promise and forget( or change
.their*.mindsD.' . •	- *	.
L?-N9^re’d)ame as, a whole, is the;same old place it always was; we’ll
.neyer.be.cake'eaters or lounge lizards.. We know that? But does the
world'/know it? Every, man; who has a class on the campus should
-have .been in, that snake dance Friday-evening. The spectacle of over
half of the student body standingj bn the curbing and watching their
/.classmate's in1 a demonstration is-one that is unworthy of Notre Dame.

THE EXAMS
And now-Comes that period of delightful uncertainty. That time
that, blesses, the student body but’four times a: year, when each and
. .' .every'man looks in-the glass-of knowledge and then scampers away in
-fear tb an ordeal of weary night study, worry/ and a stuffed mind from
cramming. It is the period that makes for letters such as Witwer’s,
‘ “Dear Dad, French	wasn’t half as bad as I. thought it would	be.	It
-	■ was twice as bad.”	And the fair ones will murmur in vain	for	the
gallant who .cometh	not,’while the 1 “gallant”, at' that moment	has	his
. proboscis stuck into a book. -	, :	.	•
But it will be all right.: After it’s all over every one (there will
be. exceptions, of course) will wonder why he was so frightened at
the exams when they were .really quite reasonable.
.. And then, when the next.ones come, it will be the:old, old story. .

Comes Lionel Barrymore, who
remained unknown while his
brother' and sister rose to fame,
to take his place with them by vir-
tue of his achievement in “Laugh,
Clown, Laugh.” As Flik, the clown,
be has created a role that in the
hands of any of his contemporaries
would have' descended tothe lud-
icrous. Last season he gave some
indication of . his ability with his
Achille Cortelon, “a figure of foot-
light magic,” and this year he has
triumphed again.
“Laugh, Clown, Laugh” is not
an ingratiating play, but it con-
tains some superb acting on the
part of Barrymore as the clown
who can do nothing but weep
while all the world laughs at his
antics. He . loves Simonetta, a
sweet singer, long his friend and
playfellow, and she, in turn, has
won the heart of a wealthy young
Italian who has lived so riotously
that his onlyz nervous reaction is
bursts of meaningless laughter.
Both Flik and his rival avow their
love for the girl in a strenuous;
scene in which, after attempting
murder, Flik bows to fate. The
nerves of both give way, the clown
begins to sob heartbrokenly, and
the other man bursts into insane
laughter. Flik generously shakes
his rival’s hand, and as the curtain
descends, stands, dazed and broken,
his arm still moving in a mechanical
gesture.	.
Simonetta realizes the strength
of the clown’s love for her and goes
to his lodgings one night in the
midst of a terrific storm to tell
him that her Iqfe for the profligate
has been a mistake, and offers to
_marry_ .him. / .Although he..L seesj
through her pretense,' born of her I
long association with .him, Flik
seems to consent, and. she leaves
him with the assurance that she will
see him on the morrow.
■: His. melancholia returns, and he
again begins to wee]J. Cursing him-
self for his weakness, he gazes at
himself in a glass and endeavors to
laugh. Flik, the stage clown, can
make him laugh. He arranges the
chairs in a semi-circle, and, put-
ting on his clown’s costume and
the ridiculous nose he had worn on
the stage, begins his performance

“I can laugh,” he cries, and then,
pressing a knife to his side, sinks
to the floor while the storm in-
creases in fury, and the rain seems
to beat in at the window.
It was at this point that an en-

TREATMENT OF CHAPERONES
[Daily Nebraskan] •
Many students will attend scores
of parties this year and they will
have an occasion to meet hundreds
of chaperones. At those various
parties, the chaperones will have
the interesting task of sitting
around while you enjoy yourself
on the dance floor.
Do you'ever think that they are
guests at that party; that they are
favoring you with their presence?
Do you think that they are ex-
