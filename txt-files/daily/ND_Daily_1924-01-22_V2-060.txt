JAMES C. O’BRIEN
ADDRESSES K. OFC
I am delighted with the weather
■ that has been bothering many of
US of late- Delighted, because of
I the beneficial results it has on my
Only yesterday morning it
health. Only yesterday morning it
was necessary for me to cut two
classes, and stay in bed, until the
snow-plow has prepared the way
to classes of trial, torture, and trib-
ulations. Certainly, I am taking
the same course you are, anony-
mous reader.	’

Sunday, you know, is ordinarily
my busy day. It is the time when
I collect hieroglyphic jottings in
The. Red-Backed Book, when I
gather evidence at pink (or green)
teas, taking notes for my society
.column. .	’
.	-o- -o-
So, disregarding “vapid vapor-
ings” I turn to the more serious
duties of contest editor. Interest
is as great as usual (4 per cent at
most banks) and tetters now haunt
my dreams. The Well-Dressed Ham
(a typographical error, I assure
you) Contest has assumed such
proportions that contest rules are
being drawn up, and complete data,
will be given out soon (so will the
contest).

I can publish only a few tetters
today, selected from my waste-
basket with- the aid of' a divining
rod. The first follows:	z ,
“ > . . . I take the liberty of en-
tering another candidate for your
‘Best-Dressed Man on the Campus.’’
Allow me to mention the ‘Demon
Accountant,’ Antonio Roxas, known
. to the Latin colony of Notre Dame
’ as the Rudolph Valentino of Spain.

Freshman hall, of late, has been

that its boys WILL do things, that

‘'Citizenship” is Discussed by For-!
mer State Attorney of Illinois;
Initiation Sunday.
“Citizenship is a thing: that should
inspire a man to do the right thing
at the right time for the best inter-
est of his country. Never should
it seek to discriminate against any
class, religious sect, or organization
that is not opposed to the princi-
ples of the government,” said James
C. O’Brien in an address at the
Knights of Columbus initiation ban-
quet held Sunday evening at the
Hotel LaSalle.
“Merely because the members of.
a certain, organization garb them-
selves in white robes, and assemble
like heifers in a cowpasture at Mid-
night, beneath the glow of a fiery
cross, and bellow, about ‘Patriotism
and 100 per cent Americanism,’ is
no reason why they should take it
upon themselves to take the law
into their own hands, and- admin-
ister justice as they think they see
it. ■	.
“It matters not to me what na-
tionality a man is or what religious
creed'he professes. Whether he be
born on American or foreign soil/
he is entitled to the trial by jury
which is due each and every Amer-
ican citizen,” Mr. O’Brien con-
cluded. .	.
There were two hundred persons
at the banquet and Mr. O’Brien,
who is .known to many as “Ropes”
or “Red Necktie” O’Brien through
his career as State Attorney of Illi-
nois, received a hearty reception.
. One of jthe most. pleasing fea-
tures of the banquet from an en-
tertaining standpoint, was the -15-
minufe talk on “Dealing with. Fu-
tu^es;”-by Rev. Patrick-Carrollj.-C.
S. C. Father Carroll’s .talk proved
to be one of the most delightful
that a Notre Dame audience has
had the fortune of hearing fop some
time. ' ’ • ' -	•	;
Brief talks, were also given by
State Deputy Doherty and Charles
Quinlan, both of whom are promi-
nent in Knights of Columbus activ-
Eccentric Visitor
Arrives on Campus
The faculty wishes to announce
the addition of a new^member to
their ranks who it is expected will
do much work at the university. The
newcomer intends during his stay
to confine all students to their re-
spective halls as much as possible.
Since his arrival Sunday evening
he has carried out his threat to .the
tetter.
Because of the tyrant’s eccentric
habits, no member of the faculty
was prepared to state the length
of the time he would be with us.
The weather man however was-not
so non-commital. ■	.
“This zero wave ought to hang
on for at least another day,” he an-
nounced. “Since Sunday evening
the temperature has varied between
zero and 10 below. Another snow
storm is probable for the night. It
ought to come from the direction of
the lakes.”	- v
We looked at him severely.
“Don’t know whether we should
publish that last statement of
yours or not,” we bluntly remarked.
“This last storm arrived six hours
before you said it would, and it
came from the east, too.”
“Easily explained,” he replied,
“that storm fooled us by taking the
natural route from Buffalo, it fol-
lowed the New York Central all
the way. Usually it strikes off into
Canada and makes a south bend to
get here.” .'

MAYOR SEEBIRT
ADDRESSES CLUB
Mayor Is Guest of Honor at Pipe and
• Bowl Pinner; Father’Healy Is
, - Made Honorary President. . -
. Mayor Eli Seebirt of South
Bend was the guest of honor at'the
regular meeting of the Pipe and
Bowl club held in the Rotary room
of the Oliver hotel last night. -
In addressing the members of the
club, Mayor Seebirt commended the
organization for its purpose and
said that he believes the need of
such clubs is imperative under the
regime of present-day university
life. He noted that the Pipe and
Bowk is the sort of organization
that tends to lessen the danger of
student provincialism, by bringing
the students of the various depart-
ments and classes together. He
complimented the student body of
the University upon its attitude
toward South Bend, saying that
during his time as mayor Notre
Dame men have never caused any
disorder in the city.	1
Rev. Kerndt Healy was unani-
mously elected Honorary President
of the club, and spoke in his char-
acteristically humorous style. Ver-
non Rickard, accompanied. by Har-
old Thomas, sang “My Mother” and
“In the Garden.” Following .this
numbers, Toastmaster * Brennan
called upon several members and
guests for. short talks? Those who
spoke were .. Don Gallagher,. Dan
Hickey,-Jack Scallanr Anse Milter,
and Jerry* Holland.	.
President Dineen brought impor-
tant business matters before the
club members and the meeting.end-
ed with the singing of the “Victory
Song.” .	’	■

A READING COURSE
Though all students admit that they, should read much—that their
regular course of studies should be supplemented by much outside
reading, and too, by a certain amount of literary rambling—few stu-
dents read as much as they should. The circulation figures of the
' Notre Dame Library and-of other university libraries are startling;
they indicate that. a very few students read much outride of texts,
• assigned-.matter and a bit of modern fiction, usually the magazine kind.
One of the-reasons for. this condition is time. At many schools,
and at. Notre Dame, too, the schedule is so crowded with necessary,
work that extra-curricular work-is difficult. *	„
'- Princeton is attempting to remedy the condition by a system’put
into effect this year. Princeton is giving credit, for outside reading.
Circulation figures o.f the Princeton Library have, accordingly, been.
/ .doubled this. year. Juniors and seniors attending.. Princeton now are
required to take only, four courses instead-of the accustomed five. In
. place, of the. fifth course, the men . must do a large amount of outside
reading. A- comprehensive examination will be given at the end of
each year in order to determine credit for .the work done. The extra
books ta.be read are-chosen by the student according to the department
in which he decides to maj or. .
. . .The situation of a reading:paucity exists. None of us would be
’ overj oyed ’ by the frequent sight of' stunted, ‘ shell-rim-glassed youths
with large foreheads and large volumes parading the campus, but now
and then it would not be disturbing to.?see. a normal chap with an
ordinary-sized book under his’ arm—a bb6k~nof required for class work.
What Others Say
By DENNIS J. O’NEILL^
The Notre Dame Daily
- ; The four page sheet issued at the
most journalistic university; in the
country is featured, by editorials of
a standard reached by few other
college newspapers, red-hot, straight
; from the shoulder thunderbolts.
The set-up ..of this sizeable sheet
is well done, the sport. stories in
particular being ideal. “The Rub-
down” takes the place of our
- “Through the Eagle’s Eye.” The
.. column. “Campus By-Paths”; is ,ex-
' cellent, humor'being more partic-
: . ularly appeased ; by another column
anywhere in the paper.
In features the “Daily” is rich,
theJatest.edition being. “The Daily
Questionnaire.” In answer to the
question, “Would you rather take
a chance on seeing dramatic produc-
- tions written and. presented by. our
own "men, or merely, have the. stu-
dents present, standard plays?”—-a
question which might easily apply
to B. C.—there, were, printed- the
following answers:	-
“I’d take a chance any time on
the show being Notre Dame
throughout. . I have; no doubt the
efforts of the students would be
well received;” “If we put on
standard plays7 our _ interest would
be ; centered only, in the actors,’
whereas if the plays were written
by a student,.we would appreciate
not only the: actors but also the
playwright.”	..
As to the other features we have
“What; Others Say,” and . more
prominently “The Ink Well,” a clev-
. erly written literary column, whose
ofily rival is the University of
Rochester’s “The ; Library Steps.”
Do you remember George Gipp, No-
tre Dame’s most famous grid star,
who died in the prime of his ca-
' reer?;- .The last verse of a poem in.
his memory found in “The Ink
Well” reads.as follows:
“O Lady, you' have taken of our
- best .	. .	-.
To make a playmate for the Sera-
: phim; ;
There oh the wide sweet campus of
the blest,
Be good to him.”	-
The “Daily” has also adopted the
Letter Box, with the 'inscription,
“Don’t wail about it, write about
The paper, however, is not the
only publication, of the college. The
monthly journal, the “Scholastic,’’
is one of the finest monthlies of the
middle west, modernistic in style,
not bound by convention'/ nor yet
“free versaic,” peppy, lively,, and
up-to-the-minute literature.
Quite recently the Scribblers
Club, the “Lit” at N. D., issued a
book of student verse, which sold
like hot-cakes. ; Notre Dame has
the reputation of producing the fin-
est verse of the west, as has B. C.
this side of the Alleghenies.
Concerning this poetic publica-
tion, the “Ave ;Maria” says: “Re-
ligion, love, war and nature in her
varied moods are the chief subjects
of the poems, and they are charac-
terized by spontaneity, simplicity,
and felicity of expression.”
: The latest .tid-bit from the Notre
Dame. press is a junior cartoon
book,, containing many humorous
depictions of campus life. — “The
Heights,” Boston College. .
Why 7.000. College Men as Convicts?
“Knowledge : and . wisdom, ; far
from being one, have oftimes no
connection,” is a “Night Thoughts”
reflection strikingly recalled by the
reports of Professor Carl Murchi-
son “of Johns Hopkins University,
showing that- America- has behind
the bars in-her-prisons today 7,000
persons who have enjoyed the. bene-
,fits of a college education,, and may
some time .be able to file away dis-
charge papers or pardons with their
। B. A. sheepskins. ? '	?	/ •
... It Js indicated that the-vast ma-:
jority of these persons fell into
crime after the age of forty and
are serving first terms. The. college
bred convict is almost never a
recidivist.. About .98 per cent of
(Continued on-Page 3.)	•
THE TURNOVER
The human mind is incurably
curious. It is also/ but not incur-
ably, proud. Curiosity, of the kind
-that Aristotle called wonder, is the
main-spring of all its activities.
“Thats” rarely satisfy its inquiries.
It persists in its interrogations un-
til the .ultimate “What” bas been
reached. Perhaps that is why Pro-
fessor James said.that “philosophy
is essentially talkative and ex-
plicit.” For curiosity can never be
quiet, nor can any problem become
fully-explicit so long , as there re-
main legitimate questions to be
about it.
—o—•
When this is done the result is,
or ought to be, something funda-
mental. And that-reminds us of a
class of men now appearing in print
under the caption of “Fundamen-
talists.” Of course fundamental
merely means philosophical, pro-
vided the philosophy be sound. The
philosophy of orthodox fundamen-
talism is simply that the human in-
tellect can get to the bottom of
some things/ that it is not necessar-
ily a symptom of mental decay be-
cause a man. makes up his mind
that certain things are so,, that cer-
tain problems have been solved
once for all.
—o—
To the. plain, man, there is. noth-
ing very remarkable about that. In
fact the phenomenon is quite com-,
monplace. The possibility of such
an achievement is not questioned by
them because j of the simple -fact
that it is universally done.
---O:—	.	.
But there: are certain individuals
who are not only unable to let well
enough alone, blit who adopt as a
working principle that nothing can
ever be good enough; that as the
birds flit from branch to branch,
and brush to brush, so thought too,
on any problem, and especially on
fundamental problems, must flit
from . theory to' theory, while the
thinker warbles the song. of pro-
gress. They-are like travelers for-
ever journeying because forsooth.

. .ing France after five years.)

You ■ will see France in gold and

But not a carmine wound revealed.

Will leave you frowning on the new.

On streets that bear a listless tread.

“The; Rover,” is,. however that it’
proves its author to be .still produc-?

Those who are the most profuse
they never are able to realize when
they have arrived. They have ap-
propriated to themselves the name
“Liberals.”
Now the funny part about our
contemporary theological liberals
is that they are striving to liberate
themselves from liberalism, in the
name of liberalism, and for the
sake of liberalism. For it happens
that the liberals from whom they
would break loose, though calling
themselves fundamentalists, are in
very truth themselves liberalists.
When Protestant Theologians re-
volt .from .Protestant Theology, they
are protesting against a theology
which has always been,-and gloried
in being, liberal. What “funda-
mentalism” it has ever had, or still
has, is not native but borrowed
plumage.
—o—
Thus it seems that though the
fundamentalists may be right in
their, contention, they are inconsis-
tent in shouting “liberalism” at
those who would withdraw from it,
and though the liberalists may be
wrong in their contention, they are
at least consistent. For if liberal-
ism is right in principle—though
in -their conception of it, we think
it is not right—as even their fun-
damentalist opponents have always
taught, then it ;would see to be
right also to. wax a bit more liberal.
At any rate, the great pity is, not
that the controversy has arisen,—-
for to. emphasize an inconsistency
will help/to clear up a long con-
fused situation-—but that the really,
fundamental and at' the same time,
liberating, if not liberal, principal
of authority is receiving so much
adverse publicity ‘and such a vol-
ume of acrid, not to say gratuitous:
abuse.
' -—o—:
. Liberalism in the sense of the
individual acting as the court of:
highest appeal in matters of super-
natural religion is self-destructive,
because it inevitably makes for
endless division, and' division
carried far enough leads to dust.
in their praise of Conrad’s fiction
often neglect.the fact that his. auto-
biography, “A Personal Record,” _is
one of. his most: important works.
This, is not only because of the in-
trinsic worth of the book .but .also
because it- was the fore-runner of
the, myrid. of “familiar autobiogra-
phies” that have since appeared.

statement, that, “It is better for.

At The Palace
The fugiting of tempus has. un-
doubtedly wrought a mellowing ef-
, fect' on our nature. -For the third
consecutive week' we report the
show at the Palace as highly satis-
factory, to our knowledge .a sea-
son’s record for optimism in this
column. : Let us submit the evi-
dence'in detail.
First on the program is a revue
bv Billie Gerber and her company,-
and it’s good. The one weak num-
ber-of the act was contributed by
Miss Gerber herself. She sang—
and well, there’s only .one Galli-
Curci.	1	..r
' Mahon and Cholet are next with
an act which is well above the av-
erage. Mahon danced, Cholet sang
and. everybody seemed to enjoy
them.	_'	,
We thought Thomas F. Swift and
Co. the best;act of the bill. When
'it comes to real comedy and orig-
inal humor, Lafayette, they are
there! There isn’t a slow move-
ment while this is going on.
Powers and Wallace spread quite
a bit of pro-Georgia propaganda in
their act, but they do it in a man-
ner that is certainly very pleasant
and amusing.. You--will like this
one. '
. Just to make it. a thoroughly en-
joyable occasion, we mention that
the. Four Bard Brothers conclude
the vaudeville with a very fine ex-
hibition of acrobatic skill. A good
act if you like to see strong men at
■ their native pastime. x	.. . .
• Marie Prevost plays the lead in
“The Wanters,” a moving picture
dedicated to the principle that the
'rich aren’t happy.. Interesting, if
true.—E; C.
At The.Orpheum .
2 “The Bad Man” starts out like
one of those cowboy—and ; Indian
... - productions. that left a smirch on
, the7good year 1910 and quickly de-
. velops into one of the best come-
. dies that we have seen since . . .
but why compare it with anything?
, It is capable of standing on its own
merits. -
The title role is played by Hol-
- brook Blinn,’ who scored a success
in the same part bn the legitimate
stage. He is ably supported by
Enid- Bennett, a very pretty woman-
but a capable actress, Jack Mulhall,'
a very nice young man, and Harry'
Meyers, a.clever comedian, himself.
There is enough material for sev-
eral productions in this capital
burlesque: the loan,shark, anxious-
ly, awaiting the moment when he
can foreclose his mortgage'on the
nice young. man’s ranch; rumors of
oil; Mexican bandits, hotly pursued
by the Rangers; a jealous husband;
. lovers,; so; numerous that I cannot,
because of. my meager knowledge
: of mathematics, . assign to their
Proper triangles; and the Bad Man
who isn’t such a bad fellow after
, Ml. With a few well-directed shots
. aM' numerous remarks this genial
bandit sets everything right .again.
The mortgage es cleared, several de-
layed marriages and a few deaths
occur, and- the lovers clinch 'while
ffie audience returns to its normal
state, of seriousness..
.AIL in all it is such a good com-
edy “that I intend to^see it again.;
I hope to see all of you there. Af-
ter the show I will distribute five
dollar gold pieces to all who can
Prove that’ they did not laugh once.

Editor of the DAILY: • ,
Did you see the game Saturday
night? We didn’t!
In:all probability there have been
numerous complaints regarding
failtire of athletic managers to ful-
fill promise published in the DAILY
January 19. Namely, “Come early,
bring tickets, ample provisions have
been . made for the accommodation
of the students at the basketball
game this evening.”
We went early, and after wait-
ing three-quarters of an hour, were
turned away. Students were asked
to stand aside and South Bend peo-
ple marched in.
After being turned away^we
were told by one of the athletic
managers, that South Bend has as
much right to see these games as
the students. That they support
the team more than the student
body.
We -wish to know who attends
the games when a minor team
plays? Who stays until -the. last
minute of play? Who is it that
cheers themselves hoarse when the
team is going down in defeat? Who
meets ’the team when they return to
South Bend after a defeat? Who
attends the baseball games in the
spring? Who attended the basket-
ball games played in the University
gymnasium?
We need not answer the above
questions, the reader knows too well
the answers.
Has not the student body paid
cold cash,-at the beginning of the
school year for. an athletic ticket,
which is to admit them to all ath-
letic contests.
Who then we ask should be given
the preference of admission to all
these contests?—J. I. S., E, S. S.,
E. J. F., T. J. D.
Editor of the DAILY: "	.
The two . effusions of stinging’wit
appearing in. -your<. last issue, were
pitiful, but amusing. The hero who"
lovingly signs himself “Red Blood-
ed,” and the tough boy, “Mail
JPouch,” have, in my estimation,
warped brains,. on some subjects.
It’s a pretty good bet that'these
dukes are the ones whose yawning
trouser seats, and shredded sweat-,
ers caused a prominent sport writ-
er, last year,. to write that two-
thirds of the student body were
poverty-stricken. unfortunates, re-’-
cruited. from the highways and by-
ways, like the marriage guests in
the familiar gospel.'
-It is strikingly evident here, that
the shallowest brooks babble the
loudest. I have no. doubt that if
these braves crash an affair attend-
ed by people who know which fork
to use, their bicep-bred self-assur-
ance will diminish in proportion to
the increase in size of their un-
taught hands and feet. He whose
life current is of the hue of the
carrot, and his co-boor, are of . that
-benighted crew to whom a white
shirt, or J a tie connotes a death in
the family, or a date with the sac-
charine mama.
Having no knowledge seemingly.
of the sort that they deride as
“cake-eaters,” they bring light on
their own pitiful ignorance by scoff-
ing at the manner in which the oth-
er 99 per cent live. -

Editor of The DAILY:
.It has been a custom of the
Chamber of Commerce classes of
the University to award each week
a “booby” prize to some individual
in the public eye, who so deserves
the honor.
As a fitting recipient of that prize
for this week I would like to men-
tion the name of the student sport-
ing writer of the South Bend News-
Times. In reading over his account
of the basketball game with Frank-
lin college my attention was brought
to the phrase which said that
“Notre Dame was completely out-
classed in every department of . the
game.” How does he get that way?
Granting we were not the equal,
of our opponents in basket shooting
but as to our offensive and defens-,
ive work we were the equal and I
daresay just a shade better than
them. Figures do not lie and the
chart' showed that we took a total
of 40 shots at the basket in the first
half, the majority of which were
made within' the space bounded by
the “free throw”, line and the goal.
Franklin took a. total of 15 shots,
not a few of which were long ones.
Is this not conclusive proof that
our boys were holding their own in
the offensive, and defensive depart-
ments .of the game?
With all due credit to,, Vander-
veer, did not Phil Mohney break up
his advances down the floor a num-
ber of times and gain actual pos-
session of the ball.
This particular writer should-use
more discretion when putting such
statement in print; There are . oth-
ers besides the actual participants
of the game, who know a thing or
two about the relative merits of op-
posing teams. In future write-ups
let him remember the:words of one
of. dur most illustrious presidents
-when -he-said :„“You^can.fpoL all. of
the people some of the time; some
of the people all of the time, but
you cannot - fool all of the people
all of the time.” You failed to fool

Saint Mary Girls
May Attend Cotillion
Sister Claudia, - dean of the
Department of Discipline, of St.
Mary’s College and Academy, has
informed Mark Mooney that new
rules have been adopted regarding
the attendance of St. Mary’s girls
at the Sophomore Cotillion.
The college will furnish chaper-
ones who will take the girls to the
Palais Royale lobby, where they will
meet their escorts. Unless' accom-
panied by relative-chaperones the
young ladies are obliged to return
to college after the Cotillion. The
young men may return with the
girls but it is not necessary that
they do. so. Each man will be re-
quired to make a small contribution
to defray expenses of the bus trans-
portation.
WHAT OTHERS SAY
(Continued from Page 2.)
educated prisoners are or have
the
been church members. Most of the
few women included in the survey
were guilty, of manslaughter or
murder. A considerable number of
ministers were found, and more
physicians. But the lawyers held
the professional lead, which may be
accounted for by the proportion of
bad lawyers in our communities. A
good lawyer may be a bad man, but
he knows how to keep himself out
of the toils, no matter what hap-
pens to his clients. Some secon-
dary school instructors are in cells,
but not a single college professor
or trained scientist. The male col-
legian convicts were almost never
guilty of crimes of violence—for-
gery, swindling, chicanery having
led^to their undoing. -	.
Doubtless the chief practical
value of the survey is in the blow

O
Cream is "on even
when it’s off33
men and women more virtuous by
giving them higher education. That
college men turn criminals in the
same proportion as non-college men
is Dr. Murchison’s conclusion. We
are inclined to believe that a like
pessimism would be justified by a
comparison of the number of . crim-
inals who can read and write with
the number who cannot. In other
words, education, high or low,
means nothing as affecting even the
lower form of virtue that avoids
law-breaking.
Why? Character building ought
to be the essential thing in educa-
tion ranking every sort of scholastic
training. What is the matter with
education in the United States?
. There is an answer formulated
many years ago by.Roman Catholic
thinkers, accepted now by a grow-
ing number of Protestant thinkers,
even of Protestant clergymen, viz.,
that schools without -religion can-
not build character. Most defend-
ers of-. our schools and colleges,
and many of the severest critics of
these institutions, from the kinder-
garten up, refuse to accept his rea-
soning as valid. They hold that .
ethics can- be taught without. dog-
ma.' Perhaps they are right; but
the fact remains that in restraint
and regulation of human conduct,
religion takes precedence.—From

N.D. BOXERS TO MEET
ST. JOHN SQUAD
Card Calls for Bouts in All Classes;
Cahill to Enter Men In
State Meet.
Notre Dame’s intercollegiate box-
ing season will open with the meet
to be held in the University gym-
nasium with the St. John Military
Academy of Manlius, New York,
on the evening of March 5. This
will inaugurate a series of contests
among the university’s pugilists and
those of several well known colleges
throughout the country.
In the meet with the New York
state school, the former prep school
of Frank Cahill, boxing instructor,
local fans will be given a splendid
opportunity to see some bf the best
amateur boxers in the East. The
traveling squad of the St. John’s
Academy will probably consist of
seven of the best men, together
with the trainer. All classes of
bouts will be embraced in the pro-
gram. The card calls for bantam,
feather, light, welter, middle, light-
heavy and heavyweight fights. The
St. John’s team is ranked high in
. the class of amateur' glove perform-
ers. ’	,	. ■ .	\	'
Following. the contest -with St.
John’s, Cahill will enter the best of
his men in the state boxing meet
to be held in Indianapolis, probably
• in the Coliseum at the state fair
grounds. - The state finals to be
held on the 21, 22, 23 of February,
will be the hardest test of the Notre
Dame boxers. They will be placed
against the best men in the state
from such well known institutions
that foster the boxing game as
Purdue, Indiana, Wabash, Frank-
lin, Butler and several other Indi-
ana colleges. It is also very prob-
, able that a few of the representa-
tive men from Notre Dame will be
sent to various-tournaments in the
middle-west, folio-wing the - exam-
ple of last year, when several of
the Irish pugilists won national
prestige at the Chicago Tribune
Boxing Tournament held in that
city last spring. .
A meeting of all those interested
in the present boxing schedule- is
requested in room 123 of the Main
' building today to consider the pros-
pects of the.season and the arrange-
ment of various details.. Further
details on the .coming meet with the
St. John Military Academy will be
published in the next few days.

Program for Feb, 22
Further arrangements for the
program to be given on Washing-
ton’s birthday in Washington, hall
were completed at a well-attended
meeting of the Drama club, last
night. Tryouts were held for “The
Maid of France” under the direc-
tjons of Professor Joseph Roynolds,
and the story of an original one-act
play, which is being wr'tten by a
Notre Dame/man, was outlined.
Roles for the productions will be
assigned within the next few days
and rehearsals will begin immedi-
ately thereafter.
Work on the original play, which
is of a patriotic nature and has to
do with an interesting phase of the
First Continental Congress, will be
completed by the author by next
week. It is hoped to have rehear-
sals under way next week. Fifteen
characters are included in the cast.
Preliminary plans were also out-
lined at the meeting last night for
the Junior Revue, which is being
sponsored by the Drama club, and
which will be ~ presented here the
week of the Junior Prom in May.
Any men who aspire to. take part:
in any of the productions being con-
templated, or who are interested in
any branches of stage-craft are re-
quested to see Mr. Reynolds, Room
260, Badin hall.
HOCKEY SEXTET
. LOSES 2 GAMES
Noirs Dame Unable to Solve Stick
Work of Pittmen; Large Crowd '
Sees Game; Hicok Stars.
The Notre Dame hockey team,
led by Captain Frank McSorley,
suffered its second and third de-
feats of the season last week, when
the Irish sextet dropped a two-
game series to the fast Pittsburg
Athletic club.
The' Hoosier stickmen were un-
able to cope .with the ultra-clever
brand of. playing that was offered
by the opposition; composed of for-
mer college hockey stars and sev-
eral men who had been/ori hockey
teams for several years. .
The appearance of the Notre
Dame sextet in the Smoky City was
the signal for the packing of the
huge indoor arena -with a mammoth
crowd to see the famous Irish ath-
letes in action. The contest was a
one-sided affair with Notre Dame
on the - battlirig-desperately-but-
vainly side. The clever stick work
of the Pittsburg team could not be
solved by the visiting Hoosiers and
as a result the Pittmen scored a 4-1
victory the first night and regis-
tered, another the following, night
to the tune of 6-1.
In the first game Notre Dame was’

HALL TEAMS MEET
IN SECOND SERIES
Day Dogs Defeat Sophomore; Walsh
Wins Over Cadillac; Corby
Beats Brownson.
Interhall basketball entered the
second series Sunday with three
fast contests that were led by the
exceptional playing of the Day
Dogs and Sophomore Hall’s hard-
wood artists, the former winning
the feature contest of the day by
a count of 16-13.
The Day men proved superior to
the Sophomore quintet only after
an exceedingly close arid hard-
fought fracas. Both teams entered
the contest with a clean record and
fought what’ might be termed the
best game of the present season, to
preserve their untarnished records.
The game shows that both teams
will bear much watching in the fin-
als. .
Walsh was pushed to the limit
to register a 15-12 victory over the
net performers from Cadillac, who
threatened to place themselves on
top many times throughout the con-
test. It proved the second defeat
of the year for the Cadillac squad.
The game was protested on the
grounds that the full time limit al-
lowed to finish the game was not
used, the shortening of the playing
time being caused by the fact that
’’e next game had to start imme-
diately. Officials have not as yet
decided as to Cadillac’s probability

of having the game fought over at -
a later time.
In the only contest of the after,
noon the Corby basket tossers
proved to be entirely too fast fOr
the Brownsonites. In ringing un
the 25-15 victory over Brownson 3
the Corby team advanced to a high’
er standing in the interhall playing* '
with both a victory and a defeat. It
was the second straight defeat of
the series for Brownson.
Carroll and Badin, both inter-
hall teams that have proven their
worth earlier in the season, were
forced to delay their game until
some future date as the K. of C
initiation interferred with the con-
test. Many from' both line-ups
were forced to be in attendance.
For a similar reason the game be- J
tween Sorin and Freshman halls
was delayed until the middle of the ।
week.
