BY-PATHS
Chilled readers, I wish you the
warmest of mornings. All that from
the beneficence of my seasoned
briar and the interest so strongly
shown of late in my wanderings
over By-Paths. I am overwhelmed
with mail. The “Well-Dressed Man”
contest has brought labor* on my
fine shoulders. I need only editor-
ial judgment and a scissors to fill
this simple column.

Let this determined correspond-
ent speak for himself: ..
Dear Mr. Grundy:	.	>
After observing your article in
this morning’s DAILY ,1 wish to
nominate Mr. Wilfred Moore, of
. Corby hall. He is a quiet and con-
servative dresser, but does not lack
discriminating taste in the selection
of haberdashery. Moore is a stu-
dent who follows no line of cata-
logue etiquette but is gifted.with
that fortune of being able to pick
. the niceties which are most becom-
ing to a he man. I am of the opin-
ion that Mr. Moore will alleviate to
some extent, your trouble in pick-
ing, the best-dressed. man.	.
.' Yours truly,
'	. -o- -o- DOC. C.

given to his- choice:of •.'-‘er~

tire. ,/1 am afraid that Jean has a
handicap over the other entrants in
the possession of a “way-down-east
raccoon coat,” that,- with a varied
St. Mary’s acquaintance, makes him'

LADIES’ QUARTET
WELLRECE1VED
Laura Werno Company Pleases
Large Audience in Washing-
ton Hall Recital.
The Laura Werno Ladies’ quar-
tet, which appeared in Washington
hall last evening, gave an excep.-
tionally fine performance. The
program was, well balanced and
entertaining and was well received
by the audience.	. -
Although the program was rather
uniform in its excellence, there
were several numbers which are
worthy of particular recognition.
First of these was the “Doll Song”
from the “Tales of Hoffman.” It
is rarely that a Notre Dame audi-
ence is given the opportunity of
hearing anything as delightful as
this proved to be.	.
The readings were also good, and
Miss Werno, who is a recognized ar-
tist in this line, received from the
audience an almost extraordinary
amount,of applause. Her vocal and
instrumental numbers were also
very enjoyable.	.
. Other features of the program
were dramatic and musical num-
bers which depicted the dress, riian-
ners.and the songs of the American
Colonial period, the Civil War days,
and America in the early ’70’s.
There was also a .very charming
Quaker number.	:

General Coxey Talks
to Commerce School
Jacob Sechler Coxey, Sr., of
“Coxey’s Army” fame,, spoke before
the students of the College of Com-
merce in the South room of the li-
brary yesterday afternoon.
General Coxey told of his famous
march to Washington in ’94, of how
he and the members of his army
were ordered off the capitol lawns,
and how ever since it has been
“Coxey keep off the grass.”
General Coxey spoke for an hour
and outlined his plan of “How to
Restore the Government' to The
People and Abolish Interest.” He
brought out many interesting
phases on this topic and showed the
superiority of the “Federal Reserve
System” over the old system.
Two of General Coxey’s sons are
graduates . of Notre Dame, His
home is in Mossillon, Ohio. '

THE DAILY ANNOUNCES ITS
BEST-ORGANIZATION CONTEST
Organizations Divided Into Two Classes*
Ballots to be Printed in Daily;
Loving Cups for Winners
_ The DAILY, taking- cognizance of the fact that there are at Notre
Dame various organizations which have time and time again illustrated
their merit in the service of their members and of Notre Dame, an-
nounces this contest as the means for expressing the gratitude and ad-
miration of the faculty and student body to certain organizations. The
winning organizations, also, will receive more than the vote-—the DAILY
will present each of them with a handsome silver Joving cup, donated by
Dr. Stoeckley of South Bend. . .	-	.
Because their original inspiration did not come from men living on
the campus, organizations that are charter or branches of national or-
ganizations will be barred. This ineligibility, includes such organizations
as the Knights of Columbus, the Veterans of the Fortign Wars, the
American Institute of Electrical Engineers, etc. This discrimination is
Junior Prom Date Is
Announced for May 2
May the second has been defi-
nitely selected as the date for-the
Junior Promenade, Gilbert Schaefer,
chairman of the Prom committee,
announced yesterday. He also said
that practically all other plans in
regard to the affair ..have., been de-
cided,upon. .	.	..	-
The Ticket coriimittee of the Jun-
ior class has distributed question-
naires to every member of jthe
Junior class. It is expected that
the men -will fill in and return these
irrespective of whether they expect
to attend the Prom or not. John
Dwyer, Corby; William Hurley,
Walsh, and .Milt Leach,. Badin, are
receiving and tabulating the ques-
tionnaires. .	.	. . -
K. OF Q COMPLETE
INITIATION PLANS
Record Class of Eighty-five to Join
Organization on Next Sun-
■ day Night.
Plans for the initiation of a class
of 85 candidates into the Notre
Dame Council of the. Knights of
Columbus on next Sunday night,
were completed at a meeting of the
organization- in the club rooms,
Walsh hall, last night.	.
Although this class is the largest
ever taken into the Notre Dame
council, it was necessary to leave
the initiation of a number of can-
didates until the next installation,
which MH- take place in several
months. .. . ■	.	. ..
Father John F. O’Hara, Prefect
of Religion, addressed the club, his
subject being “Something to Think
About.” The Knights of. Columbus
quartet entertained with several se-
lections, and later in the evening re-
freshments were served.
Murray and Hall Win
Cups in Cue Tourney
The two matches that decided the
cue champions of Notre Dame were
played Sunday, morning in the
Brownsori recreation room before a
large and appreciative crowd. .
. In the pool finals Murray of
Brownson gained the trophy by de-
feating O’Brien of Carroll. The
game started with both men play-,
ing accurate pool and the points
see-sawed rapidly toward the cen-
tury inark. With the score knotted
at 84 apiece the men settled to cau-
tious play, both waiting for breaks.
One capie when O’Brien made, a
misplay which enabled Murray to
acquire a long run and put him in
the lead. The final score was 100
to 88.

Franklin McSorley of Pittsburg,
a junior in the College of Letters,
was .elected captain of the Notre
Dame-hockey sextet last Saturday.
McSorley has played a regular for-
ward-berth on the Irish team, for
twoyears and was one of the chief
point scorers in 1922 when Notre
Dame, captained by Paul Castner,
won the Western Conference hock-
ey championship after haying suc-
cessfully defeated Wisconsin, Mich-
igan’, , St? Thomas-and- thejHoughtpn
School of Mines in a two-gafne ser-
ies, and "several • other smaller
schools that were represented in.the
middle west with fast sextets. .
The Notre. Dame team, in losing
to the fast University of Michigan
sextet, 3 to 1, at the A.nn Arbor in-
door rink, Saturday night, gave the
Wolverine’s veteran team a far
^more stubborn battle * than < <the
Michigan stickmen had expected.

not in the least a reflection upon
the aims or works of any of these
splendid organizations. But we .
want to reward at this time only
-those; bodies which have worked
and thrived without outside help.
‘ All native organizations will be
divided into two classes: (1) Sec-
tional, state, and. city clubs; and
(2) All other organizations. Bal-
lots will be printed in The DAILY,
on which subscribers cari vote each
day for one organization in each-of
these classes. To this ballot every
voter must sign his name—this is
necessary in order that one man
may not vote twice in a day. These
ballots may be‘ sent to Box 21, or
brought to the ballot box in the .
DAILY office, in. .the „basement of .
. Walsh .hall..	. .	... . .
If the voters in this contest take
a purely partisan point of view, The
DAILY’S aim will be totally thwart-
ed. We warit a riian to vote for
those organizations which he con-
scientiously considers the . best in
their respective classes, whether he
belongs to another organization in
that class, or whether he belongs to
no organization in that class.
In looking over the field of or-
ganizations this high standard
should be maintained: (1) What /
organizations have done the most
good for their members, whatever
be their field; and (2) What or- ■
gariizations have done the most for
Notre Dame? . We want the sin-
cere expression of the student body,
and it can only be attained if every
man lets his coriscience, and not
his prejudice, be his guide. .
The contest will start Thursday, .
in which issue of The DAILY bal-
lot blanks No. -1 will be printed.
The contest will -close at noon,
Monday, January 28. All ballots
not in the DAILY office by that time
will be invalid. ’	.

CLEAN SHOWS
During recent weeks the shows of South Bend have been the sub-
ject of much controversy in the columns of the DAILY. Its'reviewers
have been criticized both for condemning certain attractions and for
praising others. The justice of these criticisms will likely have to
remain a matter of personal opinions. But the importance of the con-
troversy may be found in its indication . that the students are much
interested in judging, as to'both artistic and ethical values, the per-
formances which they see.
And this display of interest becomes important because oL the
everTrecurring question: Will the public patronize clean shows? It is
regrettable, of course, that the answer should be the matter of doubt or
debate that it is instead of a reassuring affirmation. Yet many pro-
ducers, both of stage and movie, give a negative answer and proceed to
pattern their productions with that-answer as their guide.
But there are some producers who think differently. And when
Fred Stone, the noted comedian, recently produced “Stepping Stones”
in New York a strange thing happened. Although it has been claimed
“that .the show was so dean • that-any Sunday school'might put it on for
an evening’s entertainment, thousands of people have paid: five dollars
- a seat to seeat. . It became one of tlie. mosVpopular shows in New York,
the ,metropolis that is supposed- to reject anything that does-not'have
sex appeal.,	-	1 ___
Fred Stone said that people really want clean ftm and then proved
his case. And the New York newspapers have said more complimen-
. tary' things about his show , than any other in the city. It speaks well
for the newspapers and it speaks well for the public taste. The the-
atregoers, or at least-a large part of them, do want clean shows.
. The .students of Notre Dame are a part of the group that wants
clean shows. It can hardly be denied that in many weeks such shows
are scarce in South Bend; and very seldom is there even a movie version
of a play like “Stepping Stones.” But insofar as it is possible the stu-
dents should make it evident that they would much rather give their
support to. clean shows instead of questionable ones. And expressions
: of approval or of disapproval have their influence because. they at least
- keep us' from forgetting the. importance of the moral element in the
theatre.	' .	- -
THE OLD ORDER CHANGETH
Fifty years -ago a freshman at Notre Dame handed in as his first
English theme a summary of. the existing evils at this university.
Twenty years later; another freshman found it his lot to write his griev-
ances and set forth his-panacea.
Needless to say, these two men said everything that could and
should have been said without being radical; passages of the Consti-
tution concerning personal liberty were referred to as. often as was
fitting in an institution with rather severe discipline.
With, the class of ’27 came another man who sat down and under-
. took' a similar task. This man, familiar withisome of the old customs,
instead of declaiming the lack of personal liberty, took occasion to
point oiit how this liberty, newly-acquired, might be kept,intact by the
student. The man of. 27, although! he knew of stringent laws-only as
history, and-tradition, had aivakened himself to the fact that Notre
, Dame is under a new regime.
The student of fifty years ago, or even ten, would be horrified at
the change. Dances, even if properly conducted, were immoral; twelve
o’clock “pers” were the sure cause of an early death; in fact, the discip-
line of much older, generations was applied to the present generation.
-This is the change: from being a.boarding school and a foster parent
there is a university, a teacher and a guardian of morals. Priests do
riot accompany students to town because they; believe the street car
. trolley is safe without them; the student is a'gentleman off-campuS as
well as when- bn the campus. ;	. -
It is up to the student himself to show that this somewhat sudden
change is justified. . And lie’H'do it, authorities say. . . ‘ -
Many are called.but few answer to their right names.; 1
No man is.so lonesome as the man with d crowd in his room.
The sincerity and conscientiousness-ordinarily displayed in Notre
Dame activities should characterize The DAILY’S Best-Organization
Contest. ■	■	_	-	. . '

THE TURNOVER
“Every teacher is apt to magnify
his own subject.” This is the frank
admission of a teacher, or rather,
the admission of, a frank teacher.
It is not strange that it should be
so, but it is unusual for it to be
admitted. For the teacher is' him-
self a large part of. his teaching,
and it is not easy for him to elim-
inate his own limitations or to see
what lies beyond them.
into one organic whole. He believes
that “where there is unity and or-
ganization, the facts get their
meaning by the place that they oc-
cupy in the system of things; . . .
that individual things get their
meaning only when referred to the
whole.” . .'

Being always human, and not al-
ways humble, the teacher not only
teaches what he knows—which in
view of the sum total of knowledge
is very little-—but also what he is,
which .unfortunately, in his own
eyes may be vastly exaggerated.
Hence 'he often magnifies his sub-
ject merely because he magnifies
himself, and thus, since every indi-
vidual is small,, the universe is min-
imized. Teachers are rarely at fault
in this matter because they do not
think, but because they think in
some isolated compartment which
they mistakenly believe to be the
cosmic system. .	'.
Viewed in this light, he is reck-
less enough to think that he cannot
attach too much importance to his
subject, for the simple reason that
it is all-important.' He is often ac-
cused of slighting the importance of
facts, of living in a world of ab-
stractions. But he may retort that
facts as facts are worthless; that
they derive value only from the
interpretation of their relationship
with other facts, and ultimately
with all facts.

Poetry may save them from this
—as a friend of ours assures us it
will—but such rescue work is the
distinctive province of philosophy.
For “philosophy is the art of see-
ing things whole,” or, if you wish,
the art of thinking things together.
A teacher who does not think things
together is mentally short-sighted.
A teacher who thinks only in terms
of one science is unscientific. A
teacher who does not think at all is
a monstrosity. ..
The philosopher is able to mag-
nify all other subjects-because he
takes them up where others leave
them down. He cannot magnify his
own because its object is the sum-
total of reality. He cannot become
narrow because his business is to
break down confines, to transcend
limits, to weld together the multi-
tudinous departments of knowledge
He is content, for the mo'st part,
to let others gather the facts, pro-
vided that he be left free to inter-
pret them. For, once again, he be-
lieves that “all meaning is in rela-
tion of part to whole; isolated facts
have no significance.” Herein lies
the chief work and the chief conso-
lation of philosophy. It is the bal-
ance wheel of human knowledge.
A book appeared recently whose
author attempted to prove that his-
tory and philosophy are identical,
because, says he, “history is an ex-
planation, and a mother of under-
standing,” a full “knowledge of the
eternal present,” while philosophy
is “never anything else but the
thought of. the ■ eternal present.”
This theory of course strikes not
only at the very existence of phi-
losophy, but also at the existence of
the past. It would be easier to de-
fend the existence ■ of philosophy
than of the past; It is impossible
to defend the theory that would
identify philosophy with history.
The case is a splendid illustration
of a teacher who has magnified his
own subject^ ' .

Love
A brother and sister are arguing
about this most interesting subject.
The brother speaks: -
I seek a love that never has an end,
A love that’s calm and settled and
: serene, • ~	'
A love-;with love its only dividend;
The kind of love the'ancients might
- .have seen .	.
Had they but watched Penelope,
their queen,
Unravelling by night the work of
day;
For while .her fingers worked with
gold and green
Her thoughts went flying to her
husband far away; '
Such is the love that I am looking
for today. .	,
The sister speaks:	'
That is not love, but only drudgery;
It lacks that breath of all-consum-
' ing fire
That gives love color and vivacity;
For me no shepherd with his peace-
: ful lyre, x	- ■
But some Apollo burning with de-
sire, . .	I. .	\
With eyes that glow with passion,
eyes that, lie,
And laugh to scorn the things that
they admire; " ;	.
You seek for peace; but like the
butterfly,
I hope to find'some joy in love be-
fore I die. "	‘
; The spirit' of -their mother, who
has been dead for some .years:
You foojish children prate and talk
- ;of love . - .... z-
In an .assured, authoritative way, '
But looking down on. you froin up
above,
I am qqite sure you know, not what
you say.' : .
You talk too much of sunshine .and
' of, May, ,
And not enough of April with its
z rain—- .	'/. •
Your love lacks night; it is an end-
less day.-
If joy is what you seek, your search
■■ is vain ’’	-. /
I too sought joy in love, and,in its
place found pain. " L_;e. L.
Forty Years in My Bookshop
< By Walter T. Spencer, 1923 A
Along with that lovable book,
“Amenities of a Book Collector,”
we are constrained - to place this
new book about books by Walter
T. Spencerj “Forty Years in My
Bookshop.” Mr. Newton and Mr.
Egan did a gracious service to book
lovers when they contributed their
volumes, which are only complete
with Mr. Spencer’s admirable dic-
tionary of published value.
Perhaps it is a grave error to
pilace'this work among the “books
about books,” for that would be
rank injustice. Sprinkled prettily

The Editor, NOTRE DAME DAILY,
In* the DAILY issue of January
13 “Old Dan Tucker” urges the S.
A; C.'to give thought to the matter
of-the rising-cost of class functions.
Under a ruling passed by the S. A.
C. last year and now in effect, the.
cost of the Cotillion is not to ex-
ceed’five dollars,-the Prom ten dol-
lars and the Ball twenty-five dol-
lars. This measure -was effected
for the- very purpose of which
“Dari” speaks—to limit the game of
“follow the leader” but perhaps, the
limits are not yet strict enough.
The S.’A.-C. welcomes discussion of
this matter through this column
and with individual members of-the
committee, and should it be shown
that the concensus of student opin-
ion is in favor of further reduction
of the cost of. these functions it
shall be the pleasure -of the S. A. C.
to take steps toward the accom-
plishment of that end. Thanks,
Dari!

Editor,-the DAILY:	•
Your editorial, “A Letter to My
Sister,” was in my opinion, the fin-
est of the year.. .You are to be con-
gratulated upon your editorial staff;
sentiments such as these are de-
plorably few among college men. ;
The function of an editorial is to
stimulate thought. Elsewhere, we
often see editorials which seem to
have no definite plan of object, but
are merely the. more or less lazy
and haphazard mental wanderings-
of- .an individual bent on filling
space.. ■
But this little editorial is a jewel.
It strikes right at the point—a
...jp'oint, .by the way, which !s becom-
j ing more and more apparent as time
goes.. on. It ■ criticizes in a gentle-
marily manner a condition which
could have been made the subject
..of a more or less vulgar exposition.
Keep up the good work..

right It starts off. like any .ordi-
nary show but quickly ' shifts into
high, and keeps gaining speed until
it finally threatens to establish a
new track record. A more detailed
and less figurative account of the
performance follows:
Madelyn Young and her South-
ern Singers were first on the pro-
gram, and the quartet worked some
fancy harmonies in~a pleasing man-
ner. One of the features of the
performance was that “Sweet Ade-
line” was not included in the rep-
ertoire. .	, .
. Pitzer and Day were, very good.
When there is a clever fellow, and
a girl who is cute and clever, you
may be pretty sure of something
good. This is.

everything from grand opera to
burlesque are offered, and there
isn’t a weak number in the whole
act. We’d pay the price of admis-
sion to see this'.one alone—almost.
Moss and Frye have an act en-
titled “How High Is Up,” and it’s
what little Rollo would call “a
screain.” If you are normally con-
stituted- and - have a weakness for
good blackface comedy, .you will
get plenty of laughs out of this act.
The concluding .number of the
vaudeville was an acrobatic act by
Toyama and company, and again
we must pronounce it very good.
Those Orientals have spent quite a
bit of money on their decorative ef-
fects, and the results are certainly
gratifying. As for the acrobats
themselves, they are .the best we

THE RUB DOWN
By TOM COMAN
Notre Dame again stepped into
the calcium glare, when it vas an-
nounced that Frank Shaughnessy,
football coach at McGill university,
Montreal, and former Notre Dame
-■ football star, is the exponent of a
change in the Canadian football
rules that would make- possible the
playing of international games as
well as intersectional during the
fall season.;	.
The outstanding difference be-
„tween the -American and' the Ca-_
nadian style of play, is the rule re-
garding the formation^ of interfer-
ence, which, according to* the Ca-
nadian “Hoyle” is much more in-
tricate than the American style of
interference. In Canada, interfer-
ence is restricted to three yards in
front of. the line of scrimmage and
only men within one' yard of the
line when the. ball is put into play
are allowed to interfere. In this
country the interference is unre-
stricted. .	'	.
Some of the other differences
that mark the Canadian game are
lack of the use of the forward pass,
and a rule that allows the Canadian
teams but three downs to make 10
yards. The neighboring pigskin
chasers have yet to put their faith
in the forward pass, but they con-
tend that kthe Canadian rule re-
garding punting behind the goal
would be an advantage if adopted
in the United States.
In Canada, kicking behind the
opposing team’s goal counts for a
single point-if the opponent is un-
able to carry, or kick out on the
playing field. .
The former Notre Dame star is
_of the opinion that, the McGill play-
ers excel the Americans in open
' field running and kicking, but that
on line play and line plunging, the
Yankees have the better of the ar-
gument.	'	■	.
Next fall, the McGill school is
scheduled to meet the Dartmouth
eleven on American soil and the
encounter will be watched with
keen interest by' many . thousand
football fans who would like~to'see
the American moleskin warriors in-
vade the realms of the Union Jack.
" Speaking of the Canadian foot-
ball situation, we are reminded that
the American athletes with their
wide field-of sport events wherein
to set up their supremacy, have .riot
lacked in the ability to take up the
/ king sport of another country and
win international honors^ .	:
Las't year, a group of Rugby en-
thusiasts ;whp had .played the game
. in the 'days when California and
Stanford were host to the English
sport, organized a Rugby team and
entered the 1920 Olympics, and in
defeating the Britons at their own
game brought home international

honors to Uncle Sam.
Again this year, a few veterans
from the same group fostered the
sport and after collecting enough
finances to put them in France, are
ready to sail and defend the Amer-
ican Rugb^, title against the best
from the British Isles.	.
It might be well also to notice at
this point that Great Britain sug-
gested the changing of the scoring
systems in the Olympic games and
instead of counting the first six
places, count only the first place.
The winner of the games under
such a ruling would certainly have
a coterie of “superhumans.”
• Although the spring cleaning pe-
riod has not yet arrived, there has
been an unusual movement of. foot-
ball coaches during the- past few
weeks, that may be accounted for
all the way from pressure of pri-
vate business to the experiencing
of a poor football season, i
. With the close of the football
season at Notre Dame, Coach Rock-
ne began 'a campaign to get, every
man in the school out for athletics
that was possible. Beginning-with
the compulsory physical education
for freshmen, Rockne has given
special attention to freshmen foot-
ball candidates and with the open-
ing of the track season, the. coach
has urged every man that -thought
he could shpw the least track abil-
ity to come out and work. Equip-
ment will be provided gladly. This
concerns not only the freshmen, but
every man in school. ,
Athletics did as much for the off-
Campus spirit this year as did the
numerous get-togethers. Track is a
sport where a man may be develop-
ed into a potential performer, even
though he has never worn a pair of
track shoes.
MURRAY AND HALL WIN
(Continued from Page 1.)
The result of the billiard tilt,
however, furnished the'surprise of
the tourney. Kaufman's, ability to
cluster and hold the ivories for long
runs had make him the favorite.
But Hall, by playing a steady game,
managed to hold the lead from the
first inning. ' He added points to
his block "with every appearance at
the table. It was not until 'Hall
had entered the second half of his
block that Kaufman got busy." In
three _successive turns at the table
he overcome a 30-point lead and
tied the score. However,. Hall fol-
lowed with a brilliant run of 16 that
again put him ahead. The score at
the erid stood 100 to 80.
Two loving . cups, suitably en-
graved, were presented to ■ the
champions. The runners up, each
received a gold coin for their ef-
forts. ‘	'

Cadillac five: Sonley, Cray. Con-
in, Dunne, Thode, Ryan, McNichr
olas, Mallon, McKeown,. Rategan,

contest which was not decided until
the final point when a technical foul
was called against Corby. Sorin

Moore, Milbauer, Fox, and Smith.
Chuck Collins is manager of the
team. .	’
Sophomore nosed out the Walsh
quintet in the first game of the aft-
ernoon, 14 to 12. This .was the
hardest fought contest df the
schedule Sunday, it being neces-
sary to play two extra periods be-
fore the game was finally decided,
with the Sophomore hall -throwers
two points in the lead. Person, Go-
mez, Pontarelli, O”Neill, Sheridan,

Stanhope, J. Hurley, Navarre,
Burke, O’Day, and Cullinane.
Although Brownson was; leading
the Badin tossers 6 to 2 at the
end of the first half, the come-
back by Badin proved too much and
the final score was 12 to 6, in favor
of the Badinites. Brownson was
represented by.Benda, Bielli, Prilly,

Keogan Issues Call.
For Baseball Men
The first call for baseball candi-
dates, pitchers and catchers,: was
issued by Coach Keogan yesterday
at. a meeting of battery men in the
Main building. ' .
Perhaps at no other time in the
history of Notre Dame baseball has
there been greater dearth of pitch-
ing material as there is at the be-
ginning of practice for the present
season. Yesterday’s . meeting' was
attended by eight or ten men who
signified their intention of trying
out for the mound position, and
Coach Keogan faces a trying prob-
lem in the development of a coterie
of pitching aces that'will be needed
to carry Notre Dame through this
season’s schedule.
Graduates wiped out last year’s
twirling staff and the men who are
out for the mound job. this year
are making their first bid for var-
sity positions. The catching end of
the game will be well taken care of
by Cerney, a monogram man from
last year, Tex Rickard, Eddie
Welch, Nick Smith and one of two
catchers who worked on the inter-
hall teams last year.
The battery men will begin prac-
tice in the gym starting today.
HOUSE FOR HOCKEY MEN .
A small wooden house is being
erected on the shores of St. Mary’s
lake,- near the hockey rink. This
house is being built for the, con-
venience of hockey players, and will
be used as a shelter for the teams
during game intermissions.
