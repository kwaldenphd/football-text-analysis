Rejoice, pessimists!

•' Every pessimist has his gay day.
' / - '	-o- -o-.
Due to the issuance of the No-
vember Scholastic yesterday, Notre
Dame pessimists have cause for. op-
timism. ; A doleful issue, quite in
'tone with . the season, has been is-
sued. '
In one- story,, two people are
killed and one goes crazy; in another
a man is drowned, in another peo-
ple are acused of having no souls,
in another one poor chap can’t get
a drink of water, and in another, a
pessimist reflects on the’vacuity of
' joy and then shoots himself.

we read that we washed away the

one of last month, which was very
creditable. The story by John S;

there ’are.no letters or;;awards in
common errors of loose thinking,
loose talking, and loose writing.
Our dictionary gives one defini-
tion of loose as “lax in power, qual-
ity, principle.” That reveals most
clearly the cost of the error to
which we would bring attention. It
is waste. . What is even worse, it is
likely to be a habit, which piles one
waste upon another in such man-
ner that in the end vast amounts
of time, mental vigor, and general
effectiveness are thrown on the
scrap heap together. The thought
of such accumulated waste is ap-
palling.
The loose reader is probably the
progenitor of the other errors. He
is the one who hurries through a
paragraph, a book, or a column in
such manner- that the thought or
fact conveyed by the writer is en-
tirely misconstrued or misunder-
stood.- He then forms his opinion
upon this false foundation and
probably further complicates his
error by loose or illogical thinking.
Loose talk or loose writing upon
the subject follows inevitably if he
expresses any view whatever. It
all reveals a painful and demoraliz-
ing slackness of mind.
Any person who reads carefully
with, mind as well as eyes open,
knows innumerable incidents illus-
trative of this error of loose read-
ing on the part of others. A friend
riding to work with you on the “L”
will reveal it in some incorrect
statement of an item you may have
just finished reading in your own
newspaper.. Another will give an
oral review of a book with 'which
you are acquainted and will make
misstatements which you.recognize
as flagrant. Another writes to a
newspaper with continent on news
or editorial which shows a complete
failure to grasp the fact or thought
upon .which he expresses himself.
It is not a matter of differing
opinions.’ No fault is to be found
on that score. • It is the palpable
error clearly due to too hasty, .in-
complete, or , loose reading, . which
is wrong. It is a habit which piles
up errors through life. It, can arid
ought to be corrected by each in-
dividual through his> or her own. ef-
fort.' Such'correction will pay huge
dividerids -in mistakes avoided, time
saved, and mental ability improved.
—The Chicago Tribune.
What They Say
IT SHALL BE DONE
[Daily Nebraskan]
The fog of discouragement which
settled upon the campus. after the
Missouri game has been dissipated.
Every time students gather one
hears the enthusiasm of an, awak-
ened Nebraska spirit translated into
the slogan , “Beat Notre Dame!”
Forbidding depression is disappear-
ing, and in its' place there rises a
loyalty to Nebraska which bodes ill
for the conquering “Micks” from
the Hoosier state.	z
Secret practices in the method of
the Rockne system have .already in-
stilled an admirable esprit de corps
in . every ^member of the Husker
squad. Nebraska men are battling
for places on the tearn which is to
clutter up. Notre Dame’s' advarice
as though the season had just be-
gun'.
Coach Rockne’s proteges are go-
ing to meet a resolute and undaunt-
ed varsity next Saturday. Every
man on the team is determined to
give his, best against the Irishmen.
The “Fighting Cornhuskers” will
live up to.their, name.
_ The University—your University
—faces the most mountainous task
of years. The collegiate world asks,
“What sort of men and women are
those at Nebraska?” Our spirit
shall be the answer.
LET’S SETTLE THE IRISH
, . QUESTION!
HERE’S SOME TONIC
[Daily Nebraskan]
Before .the game with Harvard
a week ago, the Dartmouth paper,
in trying to show the students that
dope was not always right, pub-
lished the following: ,
“Coach Gilmour Dobie said be-
fore the Colgate game: ‘To beat a
team of good football players/ you
have to have a team of football
players. Our chances against Col-
gate? .We haven’t any more chance'
than a snowball in Hades!’ Score
Cornell 34, Colgate 7.
“Coach Rockne before the Prince-
ton game,: ‘I honestly believe that
we will be.beaten. Of course we
will do all we can to win, but we
will consider it. no disgrace to lose
to a Princeton team!’ Score Notre
Dame 25, Princeton 2.”.
And then Dartmouth, against all
the odds of dope, gave Harvard a
decisive beating.’ ',	-
It is our turn to think it over.
sight for the literary, musical, dra-
matic, or debating champions of 'N.
Y. U. The only J reward any of
them get while in college is perhaps
a key which they. ;have originated
and paid for themselves, or perhaps
an honorable mention through the
glowing accounts of soriie of their
performances in (the columns of
the “Daily News.” ' Never do they,
receive an indication that the col-
lege at large, has any interest in
their work. At other colleges, some
provision is made: for them. At
Columbia they can look forward to
King’s Crowri. Would it be too
much to ask that New York Uni-
versity show herself as modern as
her contemporaries/ in such a mat-
ter? With the use of considerable
discrimination in the granting of a
non-athletic award, it can be made
a, real prize, conducive to effort on
the part of the .undergraduate, and
a source of pride to the alumnus!
—New York University News.
EXPERIENCE .
Prof., Scott, director of the school
of commerce, University of Wiscon-
sin, discussing the prevailing ignor-
arice of economics, says we see the
present, and the obvious but do not
foresee consequences. We saw cer-
tain .benefits we expected from
sharply ; graduated income ; taxes,
such’ as increased revenue and what
we; considered/a .better distribution
of the tax burden. ?We did not fore-
see: the diversion of capital from
essential'■industries.' .In arbitrary
regulation 'of commodity prices we
saw'-the defeat of profiteers and the
stimulation of . production' of war
materials. ,	r '	; .
“Whatwedidnot see was a re-
mote:. consequence—the disturbance
of ’the normal price and profit rela-
tions. upon which the successful and
sinboth operation of our entire eco-
nomic mechanism depends, interfer-
ence with the normal flow of invest-
ment streams, the overequipment of
some industries, .the underequip-
ment of others, and the fostering
of ‘the belief that the government
is omnipotent, in economic matters
and ; can" arbitrarily adjust prices
and profits to suit its own ideas of
justice or expediency, or to meet
the desires of blocs, or classes that
may chance to be politically dom-
inant.” /■ ’	... ■ . "
(But foresight into the often, baf-
fling, play of economic forces is nat-
urally a (very rare quality. What
is more .discouraging than our .lack
bf .it is our: refusal to'see conse-
quences after they have arrived.
Resistance to amendment of the in-
effective income tax schedules, pro-
posal -for a restoration of the ex-
cess profits tax, price /fixing for
wheat -are all being clamorously
demanded by. self-styled friends of
the people. It is said experience is
the best teacher, but there are many
kinds incapable of or unwilling to
learn even frorii experience.—Chi-
cago Sunday Tribune. .	'

From Off Stage
In ‘.‘Thundering Dawn,” the good
• pretty well mixed with the not
so good. J- Warren Kerrigan, an
idol of several- years ago, Tom
Santschi, Anna Q. Nilsson, and sev-
eral others are in the cast.of this
movie, the plot of which is laid,
for the most part, in Java.
Jack Standish, the hero, disap-
riears because he thinks that by so
doing he can save his father dis-
(irace. He goes to Java where he
falls in with a thorough-going crew,
who aid him in his journey: down
the downward path. His fiancee,
fearing for his welfare,' - follows
him, and takes a hand in his af-
fairs, managirig to bring him to his
former law-abiding state. ' ' .	.
The Javanese scenes, especially
those which have to do with the ty-
phoon, are reminiscent of the nov-
els of Joseph. Conrad. Their one
fault is that they are a trifle, over-
done, and -one is positive that he
will need an umbrella when he
leaves the theatre.
The exigencies of press time, as
Mi-. Butler says, prevented us from
hearing Diskay, the Hungarian

PRINCETON/ Oct. 20. — For
Princeton’s football hopes, for
Princeton’s fighting but . woefully
inept and outclassed eleven, today
was Waterloo. While more than
30,000' sat spellbound in the' Palm-
er stadium, amazed at the wizardry
of Notre Dame’s . plays. ■ and the
highly tricky and- deceptive quality
of their execution, the battling

NOW
OLIVER
; THE
COMMON
LAW
With the <
BABY SYMPHONY
of Indian summer, the skein of suc-
cess was snapped. This defeat of
today was perhaps the worst ever
taken by Princetori from any eleven
outside the Big Three. It was the
most complete trouncing adminis-
tered- to:Nassau by any teairi in the
more modern era.
When West Virginia defeated
Princeton by 25 to 0 in 1919, the
affair -was regarded by the Tigers
as a 'holocaust. I saw that contest,
in which the great Rodgers hurled
one forward pass after another to
the discomfiture of the -Orange
and Black. But the game of to-
day, from Princton’s viewpoint, was
was far worse. West Virginia had
a bi gedge over Princeton. Today
Notre Dame ^completely outshone
the Tigers in every department of
football, in every minute of play,
from any angle you choose.
For Notre Dame this was an aft-
ernoon, of glory such as never be-
fore had come to a Western eleven
on an Eastern field. Only a week
ago the Hoosiers defeated the Army,
13 to 0. Today Notre Dame accom-
plished what no other Western
eleven ever before had been able
to record, victories over two of the
big Eastern teams, in one season.
While Knute Rockne’s splendidly
coached combination ran wild . on
the emerald turf in the stadium,
Notre Dame, in a way,* avenged the
stunning setback it got in 1914 from
Yale, 28 to 0.

v: Cordial Welcome.
If you want to hear of excellent
treatment accorded Notre Dame
men by people of the East ask Pim
Frain, Raymond Brady, Eddie Buck-
ley, George Baldus or John Stan-
ton, who motored 1,800 miles in
five days to see the Trish tame the
Tiger. ;	•: .
“We traveled through six states
and one foreign country and were
given the right of way everywhere,”
says Brady/ “We stopped at Ni-
agara Falls and Ontario, stayed one
night in a frat. house < at Syracuse
University,, .saw the sights . in
Gotham, witnessed the game, and
returning, visiting the Gettysburg
battlefield. It was a great trip.
Everywhere we went we. were, given
a rousing' reception. All that was
necessary was a monogram sweater,
a Notre Dame pennant, pin or watch
fob. In New York the traffic cops
told us that the town was ours.”
The trip was made in a Buick six.

Three Notre Dame Men
Studying at Harvard
Worth Clarke, A. B., ’22, Joseph
Sullivan, A. B., ’22, and Stanley
Jacob, Commerce, ’23, are students
in the Harvard Law school. Clarke
and Sullivan are sophomores . and
Jacob is a freshman. ;
Clarke was a varsity debater at
Notre Dame. Sullivan is now mar-
ried. Jesse Tarres, ’22, graduate
pharmacist, is engaged in the man-
ufacture of drugs in St. Louis. He

head. The coming mix is carded
for Dad’s day on the local battle
grounds and is among the import-
ant . confabs of the 1923 season,
therefore ;the worry on the part of
the Husker mentor.
Nebraska has? played four games,
lost the first, won the second and
knotted the last duet, and still has
more counters registered than its
opponents.
Dawson with his able assistants
has been working his proteges over-
time during the past few days and
has stiff workouts on program
throughout the coming seven days.
Last night besides the regular
scrimmage, blocking, catching and
flipping the leather filled the after-
noon’s workouts. The frosh ag-
gregation. has been working Notre
Dame plays against the varsity and
it is more than likely that local
formations are known on the Rock-
ne practice field.
Notre Dame has exhibited a dif-
ferent type of football each time
they have played this season.
Against the Princeton artists the
Irish demonstrated one of the best
brands of straight football that has
been see in the East in years and
surprised the Tigers when, they fail-
ed to resort to the aerial game'
which was responsible for so much
ground for the Indiana ’ eleven
against the' Army. Eastern critics
say that the light line of the win-
ning aggregation has showed a new
method of offensive play that is sure
to be copied, in the east. Veterans
were scratching their heads and
trying to recall if they ever saw a
guard get out and assist the inter-
ference for a back or sweeping end
runs. Last week against Georgia
Tech the Dame guards did that very
thing time after time. '
Since that day when' Rockne and
his eleven came .onto the field op-
posing West Point, only, to forward
pass the cadets delirious/ Corn-
huskers have uniformly had some
worry concerning the coming mix.
Captain; Lewellyn is piloting a new
team since the past two knotted
twists and Huskers have started to
chase the dark cloud from over
their heads. ,	. . .’	:
. The gridsters have. a closed door
program until the Armistice day
meeting: and Nebraska followers
are assured of a different combina-
tion.
