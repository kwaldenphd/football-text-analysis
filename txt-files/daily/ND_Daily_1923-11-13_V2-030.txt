Professor z Shuster talked on
poetry/, speaking about the prize
awards. , He said that he was
pleased to; see/ that Notre Dame is
continuing to? evidence so much in-
terest in poetry as the . interest is
traditional .at the University. ■. ■
Technical faults were most noted
in the poems submitted for the con-
test, he said. A vagueness of out-
line was particularly noticeable.
Clearness arid thought /should be
.striven for; he said. He suggested
a study of the poets of the 5 Eigh-
teenth Century- as introductory to
a study of the Romantic poets. He
particularly called attention to the
work; of Goldsmith, mentioning
“The Deserted Village,” which, he
said, iwas one of the . dozen, master-
pieces of English' poetry, and. was
named as a model by almost every,
conscientious critic of‘poetry. It
has what many poems need, thought,
and the clearness that poetry must
have. ■’ •;	.	;	;

•The victory- of Nebraska: over

ers came out on the playing field

RECEPTION
FOR PLAYERS
Eddie Luther/ Leads Cheers : for
Every Member of Fighting '
Irish Foothal,I Team.
“God help the teams that we
have to play from now on,Rev.
Thomas Irving; ' vice-president ; of
the Uriiversity,'. said to the men of
the Uriiversity' assembled on ■ the
main quadrangle yesterday for., a
demonstration of welcome to the
team..
Over. a thousand students gath-
ered at 12:45 yesterday afternoon .
to demonstrate that, despite the un-
expected- , defeat by Nebraska,, the .
University’s .spirit, is still strong? is
undiminished, by. the loss ..to the
team from Lincoln. .	/ .,
“The Victory Song,” sung by the
men and, played by the band, be-
gan and ended the: demonstration
which was in charge of Eddie Lu-
ther, cheer-leader. Luther situated
himself on the steps of the Main
building. The band - was on ’ the
porch. Beside Father Irving/ the
Hon. Thomas F.- Konop, dean of the
Law school, talked/ to .. the , men.
Cheers were given for : every man
on the squad. A monster U. N. D.
and a He’s a-Man were given for •
Rockne. - ; -
“While everyone of ; us'have been .
somewhat disappointed,”. Father •
Irving, said; “none of us are sad.”
The result, he said, is the greatest
upset in the; football history of;the-
year. Both s teams, in, last; Satur-
day/s battle were fighters, and Notre
.Dame^fought/as,: real men.	/
A “We are:.prquder of their’work
in the Nebraska’’game,” he said,
“than in the Princeton?or the; Army
gariie. The last touchdown in ‘.the
Nebraska game means more to: us
than the 25 against Princeton or
the 13 against West Point. If the
game’ had been a few minutes
longer we might at least have tied
Nebraska; Notre Dame ’ football
history is full of / instances of the
unrelenting, fight of its .teams.' -
While • other ? teams,: playing what
seemed to be a-losing game, have x
.wilted; Notre Dame has proved
many times that her men. do not
wilt. ’ They fight to' the ’ la/st ditch?
God help .. the? teams.. that we. have
to play from now on. '	' '
. “We admire Our men for their
manly fight and we feel for .them
a sincere arid hearty welcoriie.” ’- A
: Mr.; Konop said that he: had ■ hot
been at Notre Dame long, but he
had \already imbibed much of the
Notre Dame spirit—-a : spiritA of

“In every walk-of life,” said Mr.
Koriop, ‘‘one' must mdet pitfalls, ■
must meet with failure, and it: is

P1TTSRUBG PLUS
On November-24, a special train will arrive in Pittsburgh from
Notre Dame. It will unload the Notre Dame band, a large delega-
tion of Notre Dame students, and: Gold and Blue supporters from
South Bend and other cities. ; '
Pittsburgh‘is the second metropolis of the Keystone state. It is
an important industrial city. In progress ite ranks with the leaders.
In addition, it is1 a critical city and a skeptical one.
. ; Pittsburgh'will be watching for the Notre Dame delegation. It
will. eye. the. proceedings critically, seeking faiilts. They will find
none in a team that fights cleanly and always. When the Fighting
Irish , team leaves; theire it will have the . game and the hearts of the
Pittsburgh sporting world with them. One thing more is to be gained,
and only the student delegation can win that. By gentlemanly conduct
they can win Pittsburgh for Notre Dame. ;

IT IS A WISE PARENTS THAT
The unusual activity among the campus clubs this year indicates
that a club renaissance seems to have been reached. The fact that
nearly every club is developing itself as perhaps never before, may
serve to show that the Student Activities Committee has not.clubbed the
clubs out of existence but rather into the proper state of activity.
The sectional;and state clubs have a purpose on the campus though
the’ state of coma into which'their officers .frequently relax has: clouded,
- - that purpose^ Therens*^-sociaWeiison'^hicH~cafinbt~^^
quets arid little gatherings of men from a certain locality have social
advantages which will'outlast the four years of college. The city club
pf today will be the alumni knot a few years hence and the friend of
today will .be the business associate of tomorrow;
.In .Cleveland, there is a group of Notre, Dame graduates living
' together in several/suites of a;bachelor hotel. New York, Chicago, St.
Louis, many cities have similar groups, holding close to the friends of
their, collegedays and the old school whidh they cannot forget. How
rhany of these groups were founded here at Notre Dame and. how
many:have as a basis some clubbed club of today is a case for conjec-
ture. That the clubs may contain some measure of real service which
has been overlooked, may. present food for thought.	’

:: HELP FOR THE WEARY
Once upon a time within the walls
of • 'this university, students bewil-
dered with the intricacies and. diffi-
culties involved in preparing lessons
were offered, an opportunity to learn
how .to study. Freshmen, who had
dabbled tn:.high: school work but
had'never known what real, study-
ing meant until they reached this
campus, were given pointers on the
^business of mastering a subject.
They were given a right start . on
their, course' and were not forced to
flounder J, about : through the first
two or three years - until: finally, at
thef end of their university. study-:
-ing, they had found the secret of
how to learn a lesson./ -	:	. •
Perhaps the average freshman or
■sophomore'does not realize that he:
does not! know ;how to study ' or if
he- does, realize- it, 'perhaps ;he' does
not care a rap. But wheri ;he is in
the midst of his -junior or senior
year arid looks ‘back bn what he has.
done here, on. the time he has lost!
trying to find out how best to study,,
he will' look upon the riiatter seri-
ously. For • the ' average student
-sperids the first - two years at this:
university‘learning how best he may:
master a subject so that he will' be!
able to keep~it-in-completest form!
arid for-the longest time. • r ।
• ’ At this time dn the semester everi
the least serious-minded; of us' think:
!a' little on the matter of studying/
When it is a case • of ^ passing or:
’^flunking -a mid-semester'’examina-
-tibri, we -are’ready to look' the sit-i
nation squarely in the face? -It is!
-now that we >wish we-had had ai
'■better-system, or any -kind hf ia'sys-j
-tem/of studying. <It is'now that we!
wonder why we have no memory
for languages, now that we wish
wri had a system for remembering
chemical formulas, the definition of
an illicit .major and the situation of
the somesthetic area. ' If we are
seniors we may . have, devised a
method of mastering these things,
but if we are juniors, sophomores
or more .particularly freshmen, we
wonder why we. have such difficulty
with them..
If the freshmen could be. started
off at the: beginning of their four
years in the university with a
course on how to study, they would
find at the end of their senior year
that they had mastered their sub-
jects instead of getting them with
only, half-way accuracy and- perma-
neritriess and that they had had time
for more work, whether on the hill
or elsewhere, during their univer-
sity course. One lecture a week
for all: or part of the first semester
would take care of the situation
adririrably providing,’of course, that
a suitable man v/as placed in charge.
If the results should be what one
has Reason ;to ' expect,, then' the
course would be brie of the most
valuable given on the hill.—Wis-

The Cornhuskers/enter the game
Saturday /with the football world
crying that Nebraska hasn’t a
chance. Nebraska does not say that
she will win and Nebraska does not
say that she will lose. Nebraska
concedes nothing!	■
Notre Dame will , come here with
a team that has beaten the Army,
Princeton, and Georgia Tech. The
team may go , on the field with the
impression in mind that Nebraska -
is not.playing the. class-j that they
are. Then , will be . the time to
strike. But.the. Cornhuskers can-
not expect such a favorable situa-
tion; There must be student fight
as well. There must be one of the
most supreme exhibit >of spirit, that
the Cornhuskers have ever shown.
• Nebraska, expects every man, to
do , his duty. .

have had numerous offers to. put
on their drill at various Armistice
4*	«—••—«—„—
Included in the programs at the
moving picture theaters this week
are several good pictures.
“Potash and Perlmuter,” based
on the play' and stories by Mon-
tague ; Glass, is at the ' Orpheum.
The story of . these , two clever gen-
tlemen of business is as interesting
in a moving picture as on the stage
or in the newspapers.
“Manslaughter,’,’, a -typical Cecil
B. DeMille production starring
Thomas Meighan and Lila Lee, will
return’to the LaSalle Thursday and
Friday. ...The picture was shown at
the Blackstone last year. Some of 1
the scenes are. -very elaborate and
live up to the DeMille reputation in
that respect, .and while the story
is interesting and somewhat ’ excit-
ing, somewhat affecting, it lacks’the
ultimate .punch that might, make it
a picture not to be forgotten.
“Poor Men’s Wives/’ with Bar-
bara LaMarr, David Butler, Betty
Francisco, Richard Tucker and Zazu
Pitt, is at the LaSalle for the first
part of the week. It is another
elaborate production,, a story of
contrasts. •,
“Does It Pay?”, one of the many
pictures, with divorce as< the .theme,
is at the. Blackstone. The string
that began’with “A Bill of Divorce-
ment,” and that’ was followed -by
“The Wheel of Life,” “The.Circle,”
and other plays, some of them on
. the stage and some on the screen, j
was broken for awhile. “Does It 1
Pay?” takes up the thread again
with Robert.T. Haynes as an erring
millionaire who. changes his faithful
. Fidessa for- a charming Duessa.
;; “Pioneer Trains,” with a cast in-
bluding Cullen Landis,. Alice Cal-
houn and Otis Harlan, is ;at The
: Oliver. ‘ Thrills,'-luff, a bit of pathos,
and a bit, of humor make up this
story of a family that goes West
to the gold fields, which meets with
attack and, except for a four-year-
old son, is a family no more. After
the battle on the plains the story
»skips 20 years to take up the tale
of the lone survivor,.; v .	, : .

Behind gates closed to everyone
Fighting Cornhuskers are laboring
and battling for the big game of ।
the season Saturday with Coach
Knute Rockne’s_football warriors
from Notre Dame. .
With the exception of four men,
this is the same team that Nebraska
whipped so decisively last year. The
men lost tor* the Notre Dame squad
are Captain Carberry, Degree, Mc-
Nulty, and Cotton, but their places
have been ably filled with the ser-
vices of Kizer, Bach, and Crowe.
All of these men are linemen, and
other stars available at Rockne’s
summons are: Captain Brown,
Mayl, Walsh, Collins, Regan, Ver-
gara, and Miller.
Notre Dame’s backfield this year
is classed by all critics as the great-
est in the country; The "quartet
upon which they base their opinion
is: Stuhldreher, Don Miller, Crow-
ley, and Layden. Maher and Berg-
man are fast backfield men that
have played in every contest this
year and have made a record for
themselves.
Last year’s Nebraska’s line out-
weighed and completely outplayed
the Irish. , They outweigh them
again this year but the question is
will the inexperienced Nebraska
forwards get the edge on the in-
vaders, in this game.
Notre Dame has, in every game
except one, the Army game, de-

Irish return: : ’
.(Continued: from Page 1.)
the first period was half over. The
battle that Nebraska waged for the
f priceless victory that was theirs at
the close of the gruelling struggle,
can hardly be- described in- words. <
In the analysis-of the game by
critics, .Nebraska was playing over
their .heads; playing hard with a
fighting spirit that increased. with
every minute of play, gathering mo-
mentum with every break that came
their way. Such was the change in
their mental state that was at low
ebb before the whistle, but which
changed gradually as the game be-
gan to come their way. .
Notre Dame had several factors
. to contend with , that do hot com-
pose 'an. alibi for them, but were
plainly an'ihtregaL factor in the re-
sulting score; . The - principal point
was the, condition of the field that
effected-the . work , of both teams,
but. which very, noticeably slowed
up the light, fast backs. The fa-
mous Irish interference was unable
to get that drive and speed by
. which they carry the fight to the
opposing ends. The rolled dirt
crumpled under their feet and when
the Irish backs reached the line of
scrimmage, the interference was
spoiled and the- Huskers were wait-
ing for the runner. Thus did the
Nebraskans stop the Notre' Dame
running attack. On the other hand
it was also noticeable that the west-
erners tried the Irish end but once
during the entire^game.
Against the aerial attack, the
Huskers showed their inability to
offer a suitable ? defense, but the
Benders were not playing the pass-
ing game that characterized their
success in the past. Several passes
were fumbled, and many of those
that were completed, failed to gain
"any great amount of yardage be-
cause of the adroitness of ‘ the
enemy’s secondary defense to drop
, the receiver as soon as the toss was
completed. -
The success attained by the Ne-
braskans in the game, is rightfully
termed, phenomenal, when it is con-
sider that for the most part, the
s ball was carried back and forth be-
—-; tween ^the-:20-yard ./markers%.^The
breaks of the game gave the Husk-
ers a stand deep in the Irish ter-
ritorywhen /Rhodes broke away
from the Irish and ran to the five-
yard line 'where he was downed in
a brilliant tackle by Clem Crowe."
It was a piece of the spectacular
that occurred so infrequently dur-
ing the game. -
;	■ Noble, the star of the western-
ers’ aggregation, scored the first
tally for his team when he made a
terrific charge through guard and
tackle and side-stepped away from
the Irish secondary defense and
raced the remaining 24 yards for
the goal. As Noble started , his
- drive for the line, Cbllins on the left
flank for the Hoosiers tore in be-
hind the Huskers’ - line and dived
for the runner, missing him by
inches. It was.a noble piece of foot-
ball work. s	-
With the running game almost
out of the question since the Irish
backs were slowed up by the loose
dirt, the wily Huskers anticipated
the aerial attack, shaped their de-
fense accordingly. / .

The third period was featured by
Nebraska’s frenzied -.attempt- to
cross the visitors’: goal line, and they
continued . their powerful . line
smashing attack - that moved the
ball down, the- field gradually. ■ On.
the last'down,’.Noble: ran out for
the pass and' as '.the ball was de-
scending into, his hands, Layden
raced for the receiver and made a
desperate leap :into.the air to spear
the toss . and: almost succeeded as
the ball .’grazed‘his. finger tips.
Noble secured the oval and romped
over the. linei ’
i - Again; in the; third quarter, Lay-
den made a spectacular catch of
Stuhldreher’s pass . in, midfield when
he dove into the air, grasped the
ball and fell on his'face.. The pass
was complete.: Notre Dame's best
:chance to score came, when the
Irish had taken the ball through the
Nebraskan team down to the shad-
ows.of the Huskers’ goal and Stuhl-
dreher passed to Layden over the
line. < It was a difficult play and the
; brilliant fullback made a supreme
effort to grasp the ball by a flying
leap.	(	,	-
. In the last few minutes of play,
with Maher, Houser and Cerney in
the backfield, the Rockmen dazzled
‘the Huskers with a maze of passes
.that were completed through the
wonderful work of Willie Maher on
the receiving end. ^Cerney speared,
the last pass and made a pretty run
for the goal, thereby chalking up
the touchdown that meant more
than seven points to the Hoosiers.
It was a display of the never-die
spirit which characterized the Rock-
men’s attack throughout the entire
game.
. By .means of passes and line
plunges,; Notre' Dame covered 68
I yards ’ through the Nebraskan team
for its final tally. The westerners’
passing game was a sad display of
ability to negotiate a score by the
। aerial route that .has made the pro-
teges of Rockne a feared aggrega-
tion throughout the country. Out-
of the six Husker passes attempted,
three were intercepted by Stuhl-
dreher. Of the ,33 passes tried by
the Rockmen only three were inter-
cepted. .The Nebraskans’ offensive
game , was not remarkable . and
