Billiard Tourney
Warmly Contested
Interest in the pool and billiard
tourney, now being staged in the
Brownson and Carroll “rec” rooms,
continues to rise with the elimina-
tion of entrants. .
The class of players continues to
improve as the field is sifted, and
some good matches are promised in
the semi-finals. The games played
to date have, been evenly fought
and it is still impossible to mention
a favorite in either division.
In the ppdl tournament, O’Brien,
Roberts, Wagner and Murray have
reached the third niche in the pyra-
mid. Kaufman, Cowen, and Lied-
ensticker are advanced in the bil-
liard division.	,

Board to Meet Again..
As a. result of the Interhall • cup
story in the .Saturday issue of the
DAILY,‘there has been some mis-
understanding. as to whether the
hall to which’ the trophy cup was
awarded also received the Interhall
football championship for the year
1923.	.	-.
. The. Interhall Athletic board in
awarding the cup to Badin hall after
-.the ./namcs^cf^that-.-hall
drawn'from a. hat, did not’award
the' championship to the Badin hall
football. team, since ■the three cor-
nered . deadlock as a result of the
Badin-Sophomore.tie game made it
impossible to: declare the football
champions of the Interhall league.

fact that it was-the leading eleven
of the first series, has-filed a pro-

limited to a card of eight games,
four- of which will probably be
played at home. ■ The cutting of the

BLAME WHERE BLAME IS DUE
In an editorial which appeared in a recent issue of the South Bend
Tribune, (Commenting on ' the language used by . spectators at football
games, and implying that. the : writer of the editorial, received his .in-
spiration on-Cartier - Field, the statement was made that “profanity
among the partisans, undergraduates khd alumni •-was common.”
We take exception to this'statemerit.? 'Notre Danie- men/ are not,
/ as .a. rule, profane, y There are, of course, in. every, institution as large
as this one is, a few thoughtless individuals who let thqir, feelings run
away with, them to the extent that they become careless, and even in-
decent in their expression. But tlie average, we claiiri,’ is gdod. Of-
fqnsiveness in speech and language is not general, -as the/Tribune
implied.-	.'/,,	;./	"/-/ ;'/• '• •/- /:' „
■ It is true that people 'have bden''shocked by/Janguage they have
heard at football games. In no case, however, has the burden of guilt
been'definitely fastened upon the'student body, and certainly not upon
• the alumni. Notre Dame has many: followers in sport who zara not
students and, in general, we think they are: the responsible ones. Notre
Dame cannot be held'accountable for the actions, or ; the language of
thbse meh,. and neither can Notre i5amb stdrid by
- " cause' of- this ‘“sporting/fraternity”fwliicliffiatrdhizesrdih^
tests; not because they are interested iri Notre Dame, but because these
games.are satisfactory exhibitions of “sport.”
We do not claim to be immaculate, in this-respect. . But surely we
are riiore-immaculate than the majority,,of so,-called sporting men. /
WEEKLY LECTURES FORFRESHMEN
The. weekly lectures for freshmen constitute a new: and. happy
feature in our educational system. ; These meetings; at which members
of. the faculty address the new men on: various topics, .have, already
demonstrated their: merit; Newcomers at any university need instruc-
tion in its rules and traditions.- Countless problems, great and small,
confront the freshmen, and many times them canjbe solved through.the
advice of older persons. ^	: / \^	//	..	.
Many .colleges initiate their new men by that singular method
■ called hazing; Rather unpleasant: practices mark the coming of the
freshmen. .Frequently the first few months are times of . unhappiness
and chagrin; Homesickness adds to the joyless aspect of things. The
hostility of the upper, classmen is . more than obvious. .And so the
freshmen gets a bad impression of the university.
The system of weekly lectures at Notre Dame is entirely*dif-
■ferent from the pseudo humorous method.'just described. According
to the Notre Dame plan freshmen [are taught not orily the customs' of
the. university, but also .the duties’they are expected to perform; the
way to ..study; the advantages‘.of books; the use of the library; and
many other * meritorious things; And they receive the /benefit of the
/ knowledge and experience of the learned men who address; them. .	-
• The weekly lecture system is the most prominent of the changes
in our ducatiorial pblicies. It deserves the attention and co-operation
of the freshmen and the commendation of upper classmen.

Editor, NOTRE DAME DAILY:
I The rapid growth of Nofre Dame
in recent years has brought with it
many changes. In most cases these
changes have been anticipated and
prepared for, but the method of dis-
tributing text-books has evidently
been overlooked. At the beginning
of the year students were obliged
to wait in line for hours to get into
a book-store that was open only dur-
ing, “banker’s hours,” despite the
fact that business was rushing. Lack
of space and poor service greatly
aggravated the situation. - Many
students were kept, waiting for
weeks ' before they could get- re-
quired books.' -Such conditions arc
an imposition on the time and pa-_
tience of the student. It makes it
unduly difficult for the student to
do his work as he is expected to do
it and would like to do it. A larger
bock store, during rush periods at
least, and more efficient service
would be greatly appreciated.

Editor, NOTRE DAME DAILY:
Since you have aroused ' the in-
terest of a number of witty corrs-
pondents, perhaps there are among
them some who will kindly answer
me this: ' -
Why do so many men go to col-
lege with the firm determination to
learn nothing?
;. Economics leads us to believe that
men usually expect in return for
cash some, commodity of commen-
.surate value, but -the majority of
men with whom I coriie: in contact
arc blithely spending four' years of
their life and thousands of dollars
from the family coffers for a small
piece of sheepskin, a ‘bit of gold pa-
per, a strip of ribbon and some
ink—that arid nothing more. ..Yet
they look' sane! •
Our libraries are treasuries of trie
wisdom of . ages, our: instructors
, ave forsaken/ the • world to teach
us~ something,'-and~our" parerits'are'
sacrificing the labor of years to put
us in* contact with .'all this.. And I
see men day. in and • day out stu-
diously avoiding everything that
pertains to knowledge.

Editor, NOTRE DAME DAILY:
1 Back.on the. farm in the "wet sea-
son when’the corn cribs were flood-
ed, Dad used to dig a little ditch
and drain off- the water. :I have
been thinking, these mornings, that
a few tiled ditches; here on our
campus might save me the “puddle
jumping” exercise which I have
been enjoying. /.	>

Francis J. Finn, S. J., well-known
author of “Tom Playfair” and num-
erou other Catholic books, has given
us a. new novel, entitled “Lord

Anyone wishing to acquaint him-
self with the customs and traditions
of Harvard should 'read “Harvard
Memories,” recently published.
While furnishing the usual'informa-
tion concerning the university it
differs sufficiently from school cata-
logues to be. interesting and read-
able. In it are, three addresses by
Charles W. Eliot.	.'
One of MacMillan’s new books is
“The Malady of Europe,”, by M. E.
Ravage. Herein is an account of
the woes, that accompanied the
,World War. The Bookman says,
! “M. E. Ravage writes an excellent

Tells of Oxford
And Cambridge
The story of Oxford arid Cam^
.bridge universities, was told to the
class in Shakespeare the other
morning by Professor William
Bucknell, a graduate of Christ Col-
lege, Cambridge.
“I have a theory,” he began, be-
fore speaking directly, of the uni-
versities, “that the makers‘ of the
American Constitution secured their
idea for state. representation from
Oxford and Cambridge. Each col-
lege is represented in the university
in much the same manner as each
:state is represented in Congress.
And since the Swiss, federation has
been moribund .for several cen-
turies, and live American states-
men would hardly have taken it as
a model, I cling to the idea that the
English colleges were their model.
Furthermore, Harvard is a child of
Cambridge, and has always retained
many of the ideas of her model, and
the American statesmen who former
the Union were educated men,
many of them from Harvard.”
Professor Bucknell said that the
University of Paris was until 1200,
the only great university, but that
nt that time many students became
dissatisfied and migrated to Oxford.1
A few- years later; another, migra-
tion took place, this time to Cam- ;
bridge,. and the two universities
then began to gain fame. Ip-’the
thirteenth century, Mr. Bucknell
said-, authority; shows.- that...there,
wyre ten thousand men at Oxford
and six thousand at Cambridge.
He spbke of the'-dons, the beadles,
the proctors, and the practices, still
in vogue, of following, . popular
professors from orie : college to an-
other, or, from, one^niversity to, an-
other. Sir Arthur" Quiller 'Couch,
for 'instance, is''W i;sd:pbpulat;'
Professorr Buckness . said, that he-
often speaks to, as. many,,as ■ two
thousand' men at' a time.' ’' ‘	’
' “The colleges are. scattered
through the towns' in which'the. uni-
versities are situated,” he-.said.
“The towns are small,, about'5 0,0 00
to 60,000 being their population.”
Cambridge, is situated on the River
;Cam, a horse-shoe-like river, on one
side of which the college buildings
stand, and on the other side of.

dens, a bridge connecting each..coL
