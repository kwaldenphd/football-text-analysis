And so our critical history goes
<on, .. Time proceeds at about the
same speed as it always did. The
thing most of us give up in Lent
is sleep. And its absence is, at
times, apparent. “Present com-
pany excepted,” of course. I am
indeed in a philosophical mood to-
day—keep repeating over and over
“Life, is real, life is earnest” . . .
and then I doze off.

I am forced to report that litera-
ture is on the decline at Notre
Dame. I have only ten contribu-
tions to “Versus What” instead of
the great number I had expected
froni. a student body whose mem-
bers admit so freely that they know
air about this thing Art. Perhaps
it is because some of us regard our
work too seriously (or, perhaps, be-
cause of your 'too serious regard
for me) that we. fail to grasu this
glorious opportunity to. contribute
to. American letters—I use the
ones I do not print in the letters I
write. ■.	'

Yet I have zealously scouted
around to provide literature of the
instructive, amusing type for you,
and have finally decided on this
tribute to that part of college life
which is at the same-time a joy
and a hindrance. It comes like an
tcho of the Juggler’s Leap Year
Act, and is not titled. I but sug-

FATHERM’NAMARA
ADDRESSES KNIGHTS
Exhorts Members to Take Interest in
Work of Local Council; Initia- '
tion Arrangements Made.
“Fungus Knights” was the title
of an, interesting impromptu talk
by Father George McNamara at the
regular, meeting of Notre Dame
Council, "Knights of Columbus,
Tuesday night. Speaking in the ab-
sence of Father Walter O’Donnell,
Father McNainara scored those per-
sons who join fraternal organiza-
tions merely forthe purpose .of per-
sonal aggrandizement. He exhorted
,the members of the local council.to
take a lively interest in the work
which the order is carrying on; to
back up every movement launched
by the council,- and to adhere con-
scientiously to the true spirit of
knighthood at all times. .
; It was announced last night that
all candidaets for - insurance mem-
bership must have their applica-
tions in by today at noon. Candi-
dates. : for..- ^associate membership
must submit applications by Sun-
day noon. Candidates for insur-
ance membership, are to meet in
i room 111, Corby, at 12:30-today.
Twenty-five applications f o r
membership .were favorably bal-
loted upon at the meeting and fur-
ther arrangements were made for
the initiation to be held at Misha-
waka on Sunday, March 23. Grand
Knight Mark Nolan urges all mem-
bers having. applications to submit
them at once. No applications will
be taken after March 16.

DEBATERS TO MEET
WESTERN RESERVE
Negative Team ln: Dual Meet With
Indiana University at Indian-
apolis Friday Night.
After having triumphantly dem-
onstrated to all comers that Notre
Dame’s debaters are unconquerable
on either side of the question of
compulsory arbitration of industrial
disputes, Notre Dame’s forensic art-
ists will now endeavor to prove that
they are equally as invincible on
'the subject of the advisability of
the United States entering the
World Court. Friday night at 8
o’clock, the affirmative team on the
World ’ Court question will engage
in argument with Western Reserve
University, of Cleveland, in Wash-
ington hall. Notre Dame’s end of
the. argument will be supported by
Paul Breen, Philip Moore, Ben
Piser, and Sydney Eder.
While the affirmative team is up-
holding the fight on the home
grounds, the negative team on the
same question will journey to In-
dianapolis to meet the University
of Indiana debaters. The negative
team is composed of Ray Cunning-
ham, William Coyne, and Mark No-
land, with Paul Harrington serving
as alternate. -
The problem of whether world
peace and American welfare can
best be protected by the entry of
the United States into the World
Court,- with the Harding Reserva-
[tions, or whether they can best be
[protected by the refusal of the
United States to enter into any po-
litical entanglements ■with' Euro-
pean; nations' constitutes tfie~issue
i .of the debate, - and is one. of; the
most, interesting questions of the
present day. Much can be said on
both sides of the argument, and the
importance of the question' guaran-
tees an. interesting debate.
The debate wilt be judged by
Professor Lagerquist, of Northwes-
tern University. Notre Dame’s op-
ponents, Western Reserve Univer-
sity, of Cleveland,, is a graduate
law school, .and is noted for its; fine
debating teams. Indiana Univer-
sity won the'only debate that Notre
Dame lost last’year, so our. men in-
tend to show them an interesting
time. this year at Indianapolis, to
avenge last year’s5 defeat.
Professor William. Farrell will
be chairman of the debate.: Music
will be provided. ,	.	■
GLEE CLUB WILL
SING IN CLEVELAND
Denny’s Orchestra Will Play at
Dance; Proceeds to Found
Scholarships.
’The Varsity Gle club, under the
auspices of ;the Notre Dame .club
of Cleveland, which is composed of
140 Notre Dame Alumni, will pre-
sent its annual concert in Cleveland
on Easter Monday. ;
Every possible effort is being
made to insure the . success of the
concert, and the',ball room .of the
new Hotel Statler . has been en-
gaged. This arrangement is par-
ticularly appropriate since Harry
Denny’s orchertra will, accompany
the GIe$ club: on this. trip/ and will
furnish the music for a dance im-
mediate following the recital. The
proceeds of this concert-dance will
, be used in the establishment—for
I the first time in Notre Dame club
activities—of a scholarship fund. \
Notre Dame's representation in
Cleveland has heretofore., been
unique in that. there are two dis-
tinct bodies. of • her, men. in that
city, who have- successfully.; held
distinct social' affairs within ten
days of each other.’ ’The Cleveland
club, a campus organization. of 35
members/will co-operate jwith the
Alumni in this affair.

Mr. Angus D. McDonald, vice-
president of the Southern Pacific

ory board of the College of Com-
merce, will give a lecture this aft-
ernoon at 3:30 o’clock in the li-
brary on “Present Conditions of.

MONOGRAMREVUE
TO BE DIFFERENT
To Stage “Absurdities of 1924"
Monday Night in Washington
Hall; Brown Is Manager.
The Monogram club’s annual
show, under the title this year of
the “Absurdities of 1924, a Notre
Dame Institution Mortifying the
Notre Dame Man,” will be pre-
sented in Washington hall Monday
evening at 8 o’clock.
; Entirely different from the usual
Monogram Minstrels , of former
years, the new revue promises to
be a distinct surprise. Although
the managers of the show .have
tried to veil the practices and the
special features of this year’s pro-
duction, many hints of the novel-
। ties have ‘appeared on the . cam-
pus. It is reported that the foot-
' ball team when’ it came back from’
its eastern trip last fall, brought
[many novel ideas from the leading
New York attractions.
All of the songs that are to be
used in the play were • written;
especially for the' Monogram club
and are guaranteed to be decidedly
(different. The- music .has/ been
written by Joseph Casasanta, Vic-
tor LaBedz, Norbert Engles, George
Koch and Frank Kolars.
A number, of clever features, all
of which have local character and
settings have been added.. The
chorus, composed of Notre. Dame
men. and in the direct charge of
Rockne,' is claimed to-be the best
that has been brought out' in re-

BOXING SHOW IS
WELL ATTENDED
Mitchell Brothers. Feature Annual -
Mission Bouts; Irish Boxers
/ Also Do Well. .
Notre Dame’s annual boxing/
show for the benefit of the Bengal
Missions was held in. the gymnas-. ’
ium last night before an audience.;
of approximately a thousand. The
feature of the yearly contest was
the ^appearance of the well known
Mitchell trio,. Jack, Ritchie and.
Pinky in the .local ring in exhibi-
tion . contests. The Notre Dame
band gave a short concert before
the bouts and played selections .
throughout the evening. 1
The program included 17 rounds '
bout, • being replete with action
Mitchell brothers and the best of
the Irish pugilists. Two prelim-
inaries and three feature bouts
were on the card. In the opener
Ed Willoughby and Ed Sherer /
started • the- evening’s performance
with a three-round fight that won
the applause of the audience. - The
second preliminary between Danny
McGowan and Mike O’Keefe, two.
well known members of the varsity _
I boxing team, was probably a better
I bout, and replete with action
throughout the entire three frames.'
Rip Miller, varsity football play-
ler, and Charlie Springer contested
the third part of the program with ’
a scheduled fight for the heavy--
1 weight - University championship.
After the third round of a highly .
interesting engagement the referee;.
stopped ‘.the contest and/declared..’
a draw. Both men seemed sbme-
what. evenly , matched, fighting on
practically even/terms throughout
the major part of the fracus. '' ■	•.
In the semi-finals Jack and. •
Ritchie Mitchell entered the squared \
circle in a four-round exhibition
bout. As there was no official de- '
cision on the outcome of the fight
between the two brothers, no.-at- ’
tempt was made at judging the rel-
ative merits of the men. Ritchie,
held the advantage by his superior -. -.
weight, but this was offset by the
ring work of his nimble brother.
Both are, bright lights in the. glove
sport, having, reached, . within a
striking distance of the lightweight
crown on several occasions.
Pinky Mitchell and John McMul-
len fought, the final to a four round
draw. McMullen holding the hon-
ors of Notre Dame, in the wind-up
bout, behaved in a creditable man-
ner against the junior welterweight-
champion of the world. At the end
of the5 meet the two were fighting
on an equal basis."

THE AMERICAN CARDINALS
When Cardinal O’Connell, of Boston, was asked why he was not
stayipg in Rome for the Easter consistory at which ’Archbishop Hayes
and Mundelein are to be raised to the cardinalate, he replied: “The
stage must be left clear for Hayes and Mundelein. This is their day;
thgy must have it all to themselves.” .	.	.
< diarch 24^ the day on which these prelates will be elevated to the
cardjriajate by Pope Piux XI at the secret consistory, will indeed be
their,, day of recognition. Yet in a sense they must share even this day
with pile Catholics of their nation; for the honor which has been con-
fprreff upon them, is also .a recognition of the strength and service of
tlie .QJiijrch in America. .	......	;
<	■ Indeed. every citizen, Catholic- or non-Catholic, may look with
aproval and satisfaction, oil the reward which has come to
these men. who,: are representative Americans. Both are patriots bf
’^proyft^ devotionandpu^	"They" have'~s'erved~theiF country
infill jyhile serving the Church. :
' previous to his appointment to , the' archbishopric of New York
ffvg ago, Archbishop Patrick J. Hayes was best known as Bishop
'Qj^lhljy of the American Army and; Navy Catholic Chaplains during
when he organized the United States into a war diocese, and
tyhVfil£d tirelessly to every part of the country, to investigate personally
th& welfare .of the men under his carp.
< Since Archbishop .George: W. Mundelein'• began his service in Chi-
-. eight, years ago, he has become known as an organizer and an able
ex$gptjve. During that time he has conceived and executed such enter-
prises as the Quigley Preparatory School for Priests, St. Mary’s-of-
thp-Lake Catholic University at Area, Ill., and the Rosary College for
wnpien. He has done much to strengthen the United Catholic Chari-
fies; and he supported earnestly every war charity and. every measure
of postwar relief. This is most significant in;view of the fact that, in
giving two additional cardinals to the United States, the Pope was in-
flqpnced strongly by the generous response of the American people to
■ thp appeal for the sufferers of the stricken European states.

A SLIGHT DISTURBANCE
East Sunday afternoon a group .of Notre Dame men, a small
grDiip^ it is true, was the object of some attention by South Bend
citizens and authorities-of that city;for ungentlemanly conduct at a
10£aI theater. “Ungentlemanly” is a strong word, a hard word, and
many of-these men. would: resent the individual specific application of
the^tprm—here, however, it is used collectively to express their actions
as '-ft. group—as a.mob.: There was nothing malicious in their conduct;
, thftt is certain, but it seems necessary to remind these men once again
that each student in . his actions in South Bend is responsible to the

versity, stands. The men who were the-objects of unfavorable atten-
tion Jftst Sunday afternoon failed in. that responsibility, although they
' dJd’UPt realize it at the time. It will be just so much more difficult
npw to reinstate in the minds of those spectators, of the disturbance,
a factable conception; of the ?Notre Dame, dollege man. The setback
fortunately is not great—the incident itself .was trivial—but it is de-
pjj^rpble that this small group could be led so easily to forget the

; Tennis is a major sport at 27 col-

cular of the United States Lawr
Tennis' association. . In six "other
colleges it is classified ,as. a minor
sport carrying with it the reward
of the varsity letter. The Intercol-
legiate association in conjunction
with the national organization senl
questionnaires on. this subject to
the leading schools of the country
and received replies from 102 in-
stitutions. .	. ’
That tennis, as a college sport, is
making rapid: strides throughout
all sections 1 of the country is
proved’.by these statistics gathered
on the subject the association be-

At The Orpheum
There’s one thing about Mae
Murray’s acting, it certainly is
standardized. One always knows
what to expect, and what one ex-
pects is administered in. no mean
dose.
>Miss Murray appears in a dual
role ,in “Fashion Row.” This is
helpful in cutting down production
costs, and it also gives her an op-
portunity to demonstrate that she
can keep, both feet on the ground
when the occasion demands.
As a climax to a bewildering se-
ries of muscular workouts, and
clever footwork (that would make
Dempsey gangrenous with- envy)
Mae’s gravitation defying personal-
ity dies of a bullet wound. Her
quieter self survives. Perhaps we
may regard this as a forecast of
her future productions; We hope
' this prophecy is correct.
If you have never seen Mae Mur-
ray in action, you will enjoy' this
movie. If you have been bored by
her before, vyou have formed your
own opinions, and you can use your
own judgment.—P. C. M.
Telephone Company to
Install Switch Board
The telephone company has re-
cently acceded to the request of
the University and promised im-
provement in the service. A great
deal of work must be done, but
they have promised that all will be
finished by the first of June.
A beneficial improvement will
be in the matter of the numbers.
Hereafter there will be but one
number. A switchboard will be in-
stalled and two operators will be
stationed at it continually. Every
building' on the campus, including
the ^seminaries and the farm will
be connected to the switchboard.
The amount of time saved by this
plan will be enormous.
There will be no more standing
in line waiting to use the telephone
under this plan as booths are to be
installed in some of the halls.

N.D. to Be Represented
at Student Conference
The fourth annual meeting of
the Mid-West Student Conference
is to be held at the University of
Tennessee, in 'Knoxville. . The Mid-
West Student Conference, which is
composed of approximately thirty-
five colleges, and universities of the
mid-west, was organized for the
'purpose of discussing student prob-
lems and student self-government
of different colleges and universi-
ties for mutual help and sugges-
tions.
Notre Dame belongs to this con-
ference, and for the past three
years has had representatives at the
annual meetings of this council? At
the meeting of the S. A. C. held
yesterday, it was voted to send two
members as has been done in the
past. These two members will be
selected at the next meeting.
RAY CANNON HERE
When the Mitchell party arrived
here they brought with them the
famous attorney, Ray Cannon. Mr.
Cannon will, be remembered as the
lawyer - who- was brought into' na-
tional prominence by his defence
of the ball players involved in the
world series of 1919. This is Mr.
Cannon’s first visit to Notre Dame.
BOSTON COLLEGE—To deter-
mine the attitude of the American
college students toward prohibi-
tion, Boston College is casting a
vote on the question. The ballots
has three questions on it. The first
asks if the voter is in favor of re-
pealing^ the .present. Prohibition.
Amendment; the second concerns
the sale of beer and light wines;
and the third question the favoring;
of a more rigorous enforcement of'
the Volstead Act. • -
quite agree with him: “a man can
be pushed so far, and no farther.”
I am a man being pushed; my back
is, indeed, against the wall, and
one in that situation is tempted to
shoot back if for no other than per-
sonal reasons. The person sign-
ing himself P. C. M. is pushing,
too hard.
I don’t think it is unreasonable to
expect a critic to be fair as well as
, clever. P. C. M. doesn’t meet such
expectations; he thinks it is enough
to be clever. And to be clever he
finds it sometimes necessary to mis-
represent conditions, and he most
certainly does misrepresent them in
his “discussion” of “The Silent
Command,” concentrating atten-
tion on one situation which does
not deserve such emphasis even
though it constitutes the climax of
action, and ignoring utterly the
theme of the picture, which is the
magnificent patriotism of these
who serve their country in the sec-
ret service of the Naval Intelli-
gence. Chancing to know some-
thing of the military secret service,
and, by inference, the naval, I can
say, with authority at least as great
as P. C. M.’s, that the theme is de-
veloped with enough fidelity to fact
and enough convincingness to over-
shadow certain flaws which P. C.
M. failed to mention in his anxiety
to protest against anything in the
nature of physical struggle.
It is my suggestion that this
critic confine himself to reviewing
pictures in which the struggle is
wholly psychological.. I cannot
recommefnd even “The Stranger”
to him, inspite of John Gals-
worthy’s tendency, to emphasize
mental drama, because the. hero
happens to kill a comparative weak-
ling with a blow of his fist, and thus
operates to spoil the entire story
for P. C. M., who will undoubtedly
remark that such things aren’t be-
ing done—unless one is in costume.
It seems to me that P. C. M., in his
personal revolt against display oi
physical prowess, over-stresses in-
cidents involving such exhibitions.
For example, his sense of propriety
is outraged by the “death-defying
leap of a hero from the deck of an
ocean-going liner, and equally
death-defying half-mile swim to
shore, fully clad, even to his coat
and shoes.” Perhaps1 such conduct
wasn’t justified by the circum-
stances pictured, but considered
merely on its own merits (so P. C.
M. appears to consider the act) it
is a feat which would not daunt
thousands of ordinary folks who
have never been in the movies but
do dive and swim a little. In the
grip of excitement such a one might
even neglect to remove his coat and
shoes, an omission which we believe
might be forgiven unconventional
(in the ^society of heroes) though it
is .... P. M. C. is too much the
quibbler.
Please understand that this let-
ter has nothing to do with busi-
ness, nothing to do with the adver-
tising which we place with you for
the Rhodes Theatres. It is a per-
sonal opinion which, for all I know,
may not be shared by the Black-
stone management. ' i

The Notre Dame DAILY is read
in many places, and by many ad-
mirers of Notre Dame—it -is an-
noying to think, that these ardent
friends should believe that the stu-
dent body here is undergoing a
brisk, all-absorbing battle with the
red-blooded,, flannel-shirted men on
one. side and the couch-clinging,
lily-fingered, girl-like things on the
other side. Notre Dame men are
normal men; some wear flannel
shirts; some don’t; some dance;
some don’t; some play football;
some delve in science ; some study
all the time—most don’t; but these
are just good fellows, seeking an
education and preparing to be good
and happy, men.
Let those men who wish to
trifle with a typewriter, devote an
hour now and then to seeking news
for the DAILY columns. Tiring of
this, let them spend the mischiev-
ous hour, chasing ads in South

On the Level
The conference indoor meet will
be of more than passing interest to
the track fans at Notre Dame, since
the Irish tracksters have competed
with three of the conference uni-
versities in dual meets this winter
and were victorious over two of
them.	-
Coach Rockne and his proteges
can look with pride upon the rec-
ord time registered in the meet last
Saturday and take particular joy in
looking forward to the performance
of Meyers, of Illinois, in the two-
. mile, who ran the event in the Iowa
meet last Saturday in 9:49 4-10.
Rockne could send them Johnny
Wendland, who ran it in 9:44 3-5.
Some interesting work should
be done in the mile event in the
conference meet with such Big Ten
stars as Hall of Illinois, Martin of
Northwestern, Reinke of Michigan,
Cassidy of the Badgers, and Wikoff
of Ohio State. The conference out-
door meet next spring should. give
Paul Kennedy of Notre Dame one
: of the most delicious opportunities
of his track career.;
Dean Brownwell, of Illinois, un-
doubtedly has the pole vault honors
sewed “up for the Sucker point col-
umn. Whether or not Wittman, of
Michigan, will be able to hold his
. own against Ayers and Evans .of
Illinois only time will tell. • The
fates are . uncertain and it would
be a.glorious opportunity for a dark
horse to step out and shine. .
Another matter that is going to
be settled Saturday is the naming
of the best half miler 01/ the con-
ference indoor circuit. Vallelly of
Wisconsin will be a, candidate for
the honors, as will Kahn of North-
western and Bruington of Illinois.

Final Score is 15 to 14; Badin
Quintet Humbles Day Team
With 20-14 Score.
; In playing' off postponed games
of last Sunday, Brownson handed
Cadillac a 15 to 14 defeat, and
Badin won from Day, 20 to 14. The
Brownson-Cadillac affair was one
of the closest interhall contests
played this season. Getting off to
an early lead, Cadillac led
throughout the first half and was
leading, 10 to 9, when it closed.
Gray and Connelly of Cadillac,
both starred during the first period;
Brownson had the, better of the
contest during the last frame and
was; leading by one point at the
whistle. The closeness of the score
caused rough playing and a large
number of personal; fouls were;
called. Bresnahan, Brownson
guard, did much in keeping down
Cadillac’s score,; while Rogers and
Riley were connecting. with the
basket for Brownson. As a result
of the contest Brownson has a total
of three wins and-four defeats, ami
Cadillac has four of each.
Badin won its sixth game of .the
season when it defeated the Day
tossers in the gymnasium Tuesday
night. The off-campus team start-
ed off with an early lead and was
ahead, 8 to 0, at the end of the
first quarter. Badin,, however, sank
three field goals toward the last of
the game and was lagging by . only
two' points . when the first half
ended. Johannas and'Conroy, Day,
were. the main scorers during this
half.' Badin, came back strong the
