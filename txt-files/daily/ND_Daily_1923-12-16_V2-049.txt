And now comes an opportunity
to ask that old, old question—
/	,■ -o- £i0- p
Is it cold enough for yoii to-day?
’	* -Oy -O-
Consider the radiators — they
steam not, peither do' they heat,
I feel so sorry sometimes for those
little radiators^—they do get so ‘cold..
Very .often I throw my big warm
overcoat ^ver the poor little/things
to protect them from the elements.
/	-o- -o-	/ /
This ^morning when the .merry
“clank-clank” (not to mention the
chu-chunk—chu-chunk!) .of the
steam coming through the pipes
was missing from my poor .little
radiator—there came a soft voice/
,^ike a combination cement crusher
/and steam calliope, asking someone
ii who-must have been four hundred
/ yards away, if he had been to~the
/ Stag -Supper held, at the College
’ inn the other night. ,	■
■	•	--o- -o-	- '
i .The voice.sounded very familiar.
. It might have been John Moran; it-
hight have been ’Gilbert Schaefer,
blit neither of these worthies get
'< up that early, so we must-rest con-
. / tent ' .with the supposition that it
was Jack Kane.; Jack, since the ad-

himself to unravel most of the

Richard Zilky, president of the
Villagers, stated that all the efforts
of the club would be centered .in
the third annual Post Exam dance,

IRISH BASKETEERS
BEAT ARMOUR,29-17
Much Speed and Pretty Passing
Displayed as Notre Dame Opens
Home Court Season. .
The Notre Dame basket ball team
defeated the Armour Institute quin-
tet from Chicago, 29 to 17, in the
opening game of the Irish court sea-
son on the “Y” floor last night.
The) game, which was replete •
with speed, particularly displayed
by the Irish forwards, was of the
usual early season variety, but con-
sidering the fact that Coach Keb-
gan’s men have had but two weeks
of real practice they exhibited
seme pretty form with the short
■ pass, and with i few more weeks
of xhard practice, the team work
I that will be developed should be
hard to beat. Last night the Irish
enjoyed no little success in sifting
through the visitors’ defense, and
with the great speed of the for-
wards bids fair to have a basket
tossing pair on the front line that
will not be easy to stop.
Clem Crowe, Charlie Waid, and
Enright comprised a fast trio of
forwards, and combined with the
speed of Miller and Riordan, the
steel rings took the ball 15 times
for 29 points, Crowe counting for
four field goals and one free throw/
while Miller hung up four fleldz
goals and Charlie Ward was credited
with three field goals.
Mayl and Kizer opened the game
and displayed some, of'the form that
made them stars of last year’s quin-
tet. Adam Walsh and Joe Bach,
who -replaced Mayl and Kizer, con-
tinued the pace set by their team-
। mates/" and’ exhibited some pretty
defense work. .
I J. McLaren was the leading point
scorer for the visitors and played a
good all-around game as did his
teammates, Terry and Gaylord, the
'atter being captain of the Chicago
quintet.

MUDDY PERFUME
The holiday season, brandishing innumerable banquets, is upon
us, and the after-dinner speech is now in order. To forestall criticism
and“.-perhaps, correct an existing evil, it is important that the ethics
-of the banquet speech, as uttered by a Catholic college man, be set
forth. The college man is too often accused of vulgarity; perhaps
there is some cause	and "just reason for the	accusation.	But
that vulgarity should	enter the	banquet talks of	students is	to be
regretted; and for the most part,	emphatically denied. '	~
The. after-dinner	speech is	something of' an	art. It requires
careful discrimination, judicious “leaving out,” and just the right
degree and type of humor. It would hot be a serious criticism to ac-
\ cuse a man of not being an entertaining speaker; it would be serious
to accuse him of vulgarity in his speech and clioice of. stories.
. The nobility of. a man is judged partly by the words he utters
’ and in like manner, a school is judged by the utterances of. its under-
graduates and alumni. The representatives of Notre Dame when on
the campus or at home during the Christmas holidays will, it is hoped,
use their, splendid talents to boost Notre Dame’s reputation as a school
of capable students , and cultured gentlemen; At any cost, may they
. never “lower- their ideals-by-an-appeal -to-vulgarity or -.to- the ^tossing
of “muddy perfume.” „' .	■	-	'	.
_ IDEALISTS?
We are, unfortunately,. living in a thoroughly. materialistic age.
The scoffer-and; the iconoclast are in vogue. -According to a recent
census, more than half of the residents of Indiana profess to be af-
filiated with no religious sect. Our so-called magazines for the ilium-
in ati and the cognoscenti have no abiding principle other than that they
persist imgiving the public what they think they want. ,The .stage,
which'should be an influence for good as well, as a medium for-amuse-
ment,' too often lapses' into what is no more than a commercialization of
the salacious; and music and the arts, .if they are hot-actually on the
decline, are certainly not progressing.^ •; 7	.	.
A denunciation of . paterialism does not necessarily mean a con-
demnation of commercialism. Commercialism, despite the vapid rav-
ings of the long-haired, has a distinct place in civilization, a distinct
function, and without - the “hard-headed business men,” as it is the
- fashion to call them, those who are horrified at the sight of one who
believes that money has its advantages would find matters, in a much
- worse state than they are. z	.
Where we fail is in our lack of ideals. -It-was said, and said
often’, that America is-a nation of idealists. It may be true. But what
are our ideals? And if we have worthy ideals do we live up to them?
The. fact is that the idealist is classed with the knight-errant, a .peculiar
individual who persists, like Don Quixote, in wind-mill tilting. Appar-
ently the dreamer has no place in the twentieth century.'	J
- And yet, Columbus as a boy sat on the wharves at Genoa watching
the ships and dreaming of a new route to India; Cecil Rhodes dreamed
of an empire in.Africa; and more recently Woodrow Wilson, a vis-
ionary if ever there was, one, was laughed to scorn because, he was
more idealistic than his contemporaries who. lived and thought for the
present and whose object was selfish aggrandizement.
Dreams 'must come before accomplishment and it is the man with
ideals who dreams. And if it. is not too much out of keeping with the
spirit of the times, it might not be amiss to quote’ four lines -from Virna
Sheard:	i •	. . -	'	'
- “Keep thou tliy.dreams—the tissue of all wings '
Is woven first of them f from dreams are made r
The precious and imperishable things,
,	. Whose loveliness lives on and does not fade.”
The great disadvantage of the chronic humorist is his propensity to
choose his friends from that brainless class of men who will laugh at
“anything he says. Thus Kis real humor is wasted upon ears which have
not the power to discriminate.	__	—
- Those Avho fail to do their Christmas shopping early will be up
a tree in more ways than.one on Christmas Eve.
.......“The big problem of American education,” observed the cafeteria
philosopher on his way to luncheon today, “is not so much in forcing-
. < the youth through college as in forcing the college through the youth.”

Ash is a student in Prof. “Bob” Mc-
Auliff’s advertising class; One in-

this class is practicality, to wit, and
e. g.: Prof. McAuliff in explaining
the intricacies of a machine which
can produce four-color process
work as easily as. the one-process,
displayed a colorful poster of the

Curley, who was sleeping rather
peacefully in the back of the class

look at'the poster .displayed, ex-
claimed drowsily-—-“Oh, isn’t it a

To the Editor,
NOTRE DAME DAILY:
. I attended the alleged show at
the Palace this week and read your
critic’s article regarding it; also
read the offering of the Initial
Signers from Sorin. Many more
“theatre-goers” like'them, and they
would be showing . Uncle Tom’s
Cabin on lantern slides and getting
by. with it. No doubt they are
among the few who get a kick out
of the ham-and-egg wise crackers
who do everything but wave the
American flag in order to draw ap-
plause. And I can see them burst
into an uproar when one of the
third class circuit boys comes out
and tells one about Niles or Misha-
waka.	'
T believe your critic should be
congratulated for giving his honest
opinion of the show. What would
be the purpose of a critic if he did
not tell us what he thought? It is
lucky for the DAILY that your
critic is clever enough to express
his opinion of some of .those Palace
bills without the use of cuss words.
As for the remark regarding the
Follies I venture to say that these
few from Sorin would need an in-
terpreter with them in order to en-
joy the performance.'

I was .passing a group of fresh-
men the other day on my rounds of
the different pool rooms, and li-
braries, and chanced by accident to
run across a group in earnest con-
versation. Disguising myself 'as
rapidly as . possible, T ventured
closer. I heard: a'voice. “I’m real-
ly so busy, Avith my work and things,
that J don’t see how I can ever go
home at. Christmas. Really I have
no time for meetings, and clubs,
and. those things, and. hardly ever
have time to go to town.” Gazing
closer at this industrious and truly
remarkable youth, I observed none
other than President Riedy of the
yearlings (as we say at West Point).

Dear Editor,
NOTRE DAME DAILY:
What is the barbed wire entan-
glement for along the lane near the
car stop?- Walking home last night
I nearly cut my throat on it. It
sure sneaks up on one in the dark
and it is just at the right height to
side-swipe an unsuspecting jugular.
The war is over, and it is not keep-
ing any cattle in or i out. How can

safety?	, '

that new but delightfully quaint
little volume, “The Scribblers’ Book
of Notre Dame Verse.”

Among the best known of the
many noteworthy features of the
took is that unforgetable poem,
“For George Gipp.” The last
verse remains in our memory;
“0 Lady, you have taken of our
best
To make a playmate for the
Seraphim;
There on the wide sweet campus of
the blest,
Be good to him.”
Writers will not let our great
men alone. The newest addition to
the already extensive lisLof tomes
concerning our chief executives is
Edward Elwell Whiting’s “President
Coolidge.” The author, a Massa-
chusetts and a Washington .newspa-
perman, , conducts “Whiting’s Cob

has been for a number of years in
a position to study the president.

Sunday December 16, 192S ‘
THE RUBDOWN
. A Chicago football scribe recent-
ly made the observation that since
Iowa defeated Notre Dame,» 10 to.
7, in 1921, he had not noticed any
Big Ten elevens that were among
the headliners in the conference title
race, on the Irish grid schedule.
This week Coach Rockne signed
two conference teams for the 1924
Notre Dame schedule and although
. the Purple clan at Evanston has
made no particular showing in con-
>,• ference football for the past five
•years. Wisconsin has been one of
the so-called headliners and was the
, equal of any title contender this
fall. Witness the following scores:
. Wisconsin-Illinois,'10 to 0; Wiscon-
sin-Minnesota, 0 to 0; Michigan-
Wisconsin, 6 to 3. There was no-
runaway, in any case. Martineau
and Malcolm Graham fought the
game of their lives when they met
the Badgers. Michigan won on a
break. And Illinois got on tally
when Grange succeeded in breaking
away once. It will be recalled that
on the eve of this game, the Bad-
ger star tackle was declared inel-
igible, and the team work of the
line was broken up. Gerber , was
reinstated and will be back again
.next year to meet Rip Miller.
Among, the country’s football
' teams that are laying claims to var-
ious sectional and conference titles,
the Kalamazoo college aggregation
, claims the distinction of not having
won a single game of their 10-game
schedule. The Kazoo. gridders> have
. piled up a total of 30 points while
; their, opponents counted 472 points.1
Among the overwhelming defeats
suffered by the Kalamazoo eleven
are: - Notre Dame, 76 to 0; Detroit,
73’to 0; Lombard, 70 to 0; Morn-
ingside, 63 to 0, and Kalamazoo
Normal^ 56 to 0. There has been
some speculation around this sec-
tion of the country as to the
speeches that were made at the
Kalamazoo football banquet.
The football season did not come
to a close without the figures of
some long scoring runs being re-
corded for posterity. Bowman of
Syracuse, holds the 1923 record for
the East; he received the kickoff
on his own goal line and ran 100
yards against William and Mary.
Evans of Swarthmore, scooped
up a fumble behind his own goal
line and ran 104 yards against
Pennsylvania for a touchdown.
Smythe of West Point ran a total of
395 yards in the game with Leban-
non Valley. Wilson of Penn State,
the “fly in the Navy’s ointment,”
-the apple of the Army’s eye, and
made three runs for touchdowns
against the Midshipmen that totaled
212 yards. .
There is a ton of bone and mus-
cle on the Centre College varsity
team this fall. The eleven men
comprising the first eleven have a
combined weight of 2,015 pounds,
making the' present lineup one of
the heaviest ever put' together by
Coach Charlie Moran. Three men
go over the 200 pound mark. The
line from end to end at present
averages 188 pounds, while the
backfield averages 174 pounds.
