ACTIVITIES OF NATIONAL OR-
GANIZATION OUTLINED;
,* INITIATION POSTPONED
Various phases of the work of
the Knights of Columbus, as a na-: '
tional organization were forceful-
ly presented by Martin H. Carmody,'
deputy supreme knight, of Grand
Rapids, Mich., at one of the most
successful meetings in the history
of the Notre Dame council Tuesday
night. Brother Barnabas, director .
of the national K. of C. boy guid-
ance movement, was also present,
and made an eloquent plea' for the
under-privileged boy of America.
The speakers were introduced by
Rev. J. Hugh O’Donnell, C. S. C.;
' Mr. Carmody talked upon the
Catholic , university scholarships
given by, the Knights of Columbus;
outlined the work of the K. of C.
.anti-prejudice committee and his-
tory commission; told of the work
being done for the ex-service man,
and spoke-Briefly on the boy guid-
ance movement.	•	;

He stated that the scholarships
were offered: to’ Catholic men who.’
had finished/ college , and who de-
sired to become university instruc-.
tors. The history commission, ha
explained,- has resulted ’ in ‘ the • re-
moving from the schools American:
histories which contained insidious'
pro-British propaganda. These his-;
tories began to make their appear-,
ance about ten years ago, and terid-
1 ed to undermine the patriotism of
< the American youth.

mody told how the K. , of C. was
striving to combat, bigotry and in-
tolerance. He condemned all nar-

• knights to respect the opinions of
their fellow-men - at., all: times, re-
gardless of any difference of race
liyered the sermon at the regulai’
Wednesday evening Lenten services
held in the Sacred Heart church
last flight. The subject of his talk
was the "Passion of Christ.”
In his sermon Father Finnigan
emphasized the mercy of God. He
used the characters in the passion
of Christ and the events leading.to
the crucifixion to illustrate,his com-
parison'of the people of the time
of Christ and those, of the world .
today. Numerous examples, were
given by Father Finigan; to clari-
fy . bis -talk, a few of which were
the Blessed Virgin, .Judas, Veron-

Hon. William L. Harding, former
governor of Iowa, Tuesday night
explained to a large audience of
students in the Law building what
he believed would be the issues in
the coming presidential campaign.
His talk, under the auspices of
the newly formed Republican club
of the university, was of an educa-
tional nature primarily, but he also
emphasized the Republican stand on -
the various questions, particularly
the- tariff. With regard to. this he
said:	'
Tariff Big Issue	i
“In my mind, the big issue is go-?
ing to be marked—a place to sell.-
And that involves the tariff. In;
what country is the best market?'
The United States of America, of■
course, because our people are liv-
ing on a-higher plane. They have
more of the necessities and more of
the luxuries than' does any other
nation. -Ninety-six per cent of the
business in this country is done
among ourselves.
“Why does a farmer build a
fence around-his farm? He does
it to keep his neighbors’ stock out ,
and to protect his own land. In
principle that’s all .there is to the '
tariff. Tariff builds a fence around
the United States to protect its
market.	»
“Here is the history of the tariff :

first tariff, for the reason that.we.

she is now studying. It is the first
time in the history of the Juggler
that a girl has drawn the coyer.
Never before have the editors
been swamped with so much mater-
ial from female contributors from
all over the country, and because
of the high quality and the large
quantity of material submitted, the
Juggler will be increased in size
considerably this issue.
Miss Jean Giomi, of South Bend,
will alsq feature in this issue with
her, art work. The prize for the
best work done has not yet been

The first Republican tariff was
passed in 1862 and continued until
1894 when the Democrats . gained
power.
Fence Comes Down
“What did the Democrats do?
They tore down the tariff fence
immediately. Here’s what hap-
pened.; The manufactured products .
of Europe were shipped into this
country, and the factories of the
United States were forced to close
down. During Grover Cleveland’s
administration we issued bonds to
pay the president’s salary. We had
to build soup houses in New York
and Chicago to feed the people.
That all happened in 1894-5 when
the'fence was down. .;

A well-organized student body, residing on the campus.
True recognition of good scholarship and a better appreciation

THE SQUAD LEAVES
Coach Keogan and sixteen of his finest will leave sometime to-
day for a spring training, trip in the south. The i ~
necessity of this southern jaunt is very great. A 1
games will, be played, individual faults ironed out, sore arms and stiff
’ muscles allowed to ease themselves under the influence of the southern
importance and the
number of practice
sun, and teamwork developed in anticipation of the hard season hiding
just around the corner of April.
Baseball this year has taken a new grip on the university. Never
before have practices been so well attended. Coach Keogan and liis
men are being, observed eagerly by the student body, and a good team
with a long string of victories are hoped for. There are some wcak-
.._nesses on the team ,which, Jf Coach Keogan can overcome the.m, will
make his triumph so ’ much the greater. The southern trip ‘ will be
the first test for the new team and the. new coach. We have confidence
in both! Good luck and everything that goes with it fellows, and “hit
the ball where they ain’t!”
IMMIGRATION VS. DISCRIMINATION
Because the time of the Washington correspondent has been so
monopolized by more dramatic happenings, the prosaic matter of im-
migration legislation has been given less attention than its importance
might warrant. The necessity of such legislation becomes evident
when it is observed that the present immigration act expires June 30.
It is true that several bills treating this subject have been, pro-
posed; but unfortunately the one which is most discussed, and which
apparently has the best chance of being made a law, is far from being
satisfactory; This is the Johnson immigration bill which proposes a
reduction of the quota from 3 to 2 per cent and a change from the 1910
Census to the 1890 census as a basis of calculation. Under these pro-
visions the present quota of 350,000 would be reduced to about 160,000.
• So far as the limitation of numbers' is concerned there is no quar;
rel, since the country is at present generally in favor of a restrictive
policy; but the fact that such restriction is discriminatory makes the
bill. objectionable. Leaders of the opposition have pointed out that
many of the phases of the bill are apparently founded on religious and
racial prejudice.. And indeed its supporters admit that it does favor
' the Nordic group of immigrants. To permit this favoritism it was
necessary to. make drastic cuts in-the quotas, of the nations of Southern
and Eastern Europe. Italy,, for instance, could send only 4,000 yearly
instead of 42,000 under the present law.	,
Yet the superiority of the Nordic over all others is a hypothesis
’which has stilt to be proved; A good Nordic is no better than a good
non-Nordic; and the immigration tests should, eliminate the undesir-
1 ables of both groups. Perhaps this strange solicitude for the Nordics
is explained by, the fact that Senator Johnson’s bill has the active sup-
port of that transient, and hence irresponsible, organization known as
. the Ku Klux Klan.	.
, It is to be hoped that the desire to adjourn before the meeting
of the party convention in June will not lead Congress to approve
hastily an immigration law which threatens to operate ineffectively and
.to do;an injustice to some nations that are friendly to the United
, States. Rather than do that it would be better to extend the provis-
ions of the present law for one or two years. And before the end of.
that period it should be possible for some capable member of Congress
to prepare a bill which will give us a strong, comprehensive and ef-
fective immigration law. •	‘
I do the very best I know how; the very best I can; and I mean to
keep doing so until the end. If the end brings me out all right, what is
said against me won’t ;amount to anything. If the end brings me out
wrong, ten aflgels swearing I was right would make no difference.—

“Conductor 1492” is a typical
Johnny Hines story. We can assure
you that, because we know that he
wrote it himslf. This is a fast and
furious farce, involving the ups and
downs of a very clever young man,
trying to get along in the big world,
and as Hines comedies always do,
ends up with a marriage. Robin-
son’s Syncopators are slated to fill
the ^lackstone with mad melody,

secret three times a day.

Miller, and Mae Busch are featured.

Any George Arliss production is
sure to be 99 44-100 per cent ex-
cellent. A group of male . chorus

the headliner of the vaudeville.

SOUTHERN TRIP
(Continued from Page 3.)
■•the home schedule on Cartier field
April'23. .	>
The southern jaunt as mapped
out by Coach Keogan will be any'-r
thing but a spring vacation and the
squad - will be called on for prac-
tice both in the forenoon and after-
noon. The team was issued full
equipment before the start of the
journey. One of the new features
of the field equipment this year
will be a. baseball coat similar to
the basketball sweat shirt except it
buttons in coat fashion. New indi-
vidual bat bags were distributed to
complete the player's wardrobe.
v The southern colleges will be in
far better condition than the Notre
Dame nine, having, had the advan-.
‘ fage of an early season due to their
climatic conditions. Nearly all the
southern colleges have been playing
spring games with many of the-
northern colleges making training
jaunts through the south. The trip
' will be for training primarily and
only hard work and long practice
will be engaged in; leaving out all
consideration* of winning ball
games. The squad will return to
South Bend Easter Sunday.
