EULOGIZES WILSON
Tells-of High Ideals Which Guided
Former President in His
Policies. ■
. Parting tribute was paid to
Woodrow Wilson, America’s famed
war president, yesterday afternoon,
when the Rev. George J. Finnegan;
rector of Holy Cross Seminary and
former chaplain of the 137th Field
Artillery, delivered an address as a
part of the memorial services ar-
ranged by Mayor Eli. Seebirt of
South Bend, held in the High
School auditorium.
Father- Finnegan referred in a
most stirring way to the executive
who had experienced such trials and
worries, during his terms of office,
as the “Man of Peace.” ...	.
Wilson’s position after the conflict,
as an exponent of world peace, and
the elimination of century-old hat-
reds;.and ■ jealpusie^^
His task was ref erred to as colossal;
by asking for nothing for America;
he became, a pacifier among the
foreign powers. His triumph among
the European courts as a result of
his persevering philosophy, then
brought the problem to America;
where it perished.	.
“Wilson lost the fight,” Father
Finnegan continued. “We see him.
going from the world back to pri-
vate. life with only the glory of
his own ideals and his own con-
science to cheer .him. A noble man
he was .... Patroitic South Bend
may well honor such a man, may
well revere his memory, for resting
in what he conceived as right, in
refusing to give up what- he con-

IRISH MASCOT
IS CHRISTENED
“Tipperary Terence” Is the Prize
Winning Suggestion by
' Boh Worth. '
Editor, NpTRE DAME DAILY:
I suggest Tipperary Terence
as the name for our Irish Terrier
mascot. His ancestor’s name, ac-
cording to the DAILY, is Tip-
perary. Let him bear that name
too. His nickname will become
' Terry, of course; and the Fight-
ing Irish are also terriers.’
. ' : BOB WORTH.
By . unanimous verdict- of . the '
three judges, Coach Knute Rockne,
Father Patrick Haggerty , and Prof-
fessor William Conley, Tipperary _
“Terry” Terence was chosen as the
name for. our Irish Terrier mascot. ■
Robert M. Worth, junior, Corby
hall, suggested the name and was
awarded the §5 prize by the spon-
sor of. the contest, the NOTRE
DAME DAILY.. ..
Approximately 300 names were
submitted to the. judges for. consid-
eration. . Suggestions were received
from all parts of the country. Var-
ious Indiana high schools\and . St.
Mary’s College rendered particular-
ly enthusiastic responses. .“Mick-
ey,” “Pat,”' “Irish,” “Petey,” ' and
“Rock” were among the names that
merited serious thought of the
judges.	. .
The' Irish: Terrier was presented .
to Coach Rockne as a mascot for
the Notre Dame athletic teams by
the Toledo club. It was through
Edward Lynch, prominent alumnus
and varsity footbalbcenter in 1909;.—
that the mascot was.secured. ,
Genealogical- investigations dis-
close that “Terry’s” ancestors have
gained two international champion-
ships and seven national champion-
ships. He is a direct descendant
from Jack of Penwood, Nora W.,
Dame Fortune of Penwood, Tapton

FEDERAL CONTROL OF EDUCATION
The hearings on the Sterling-Reed bill conducted before the sen-
ate committee, on education and labor last week should not be lightly
considered by any true friend of education. They merit serious con-
sideration because of the fact that all organizations known to be op-
posed to the bill had not been notified that the hearings were to be held;
while organizations favoring the Bill had been so notified five days in
advance and had the opportunity to bring their representatives to
Washington. Consequently there were about twenty witnesses - who
testified in favor of the measure, and only four who opposed it.
Opposition to such an. enactment, which would create a federal
department of education and provide federal subsidies for education in
- the states, however, was clearly and ably voiced by the Rev. Dr. James
H. Ryan, executive secretary of the National Catholic Welfare Con-
ference. Among the specific arguments listed by.him were:	;
That the bill would.create federal control of education as a neces-
sary consequence of the administration of the subsidies.
That it would create a military system of education with an army
of bureaucrats and inspectors.	:
-That the whole, proposition is based on the assumption that the
states have asked for federal aid, ^when ho' state has "done so through
any official representative.	’	.
That standardization of education would result in the eventual
abolition of all private educational initiative.	'
The very apparent effort to hold these hearings, ostensibly open,
without attracting public attention indicates that there are strong and
siniser influences supporting the bill, and should serve as a warning to
those who are indifferent in the matter. For the danger lies in the pos-
sibility that these influences may gain their end before the public is
. thoroughly and correctly informed. Men who- favor the Sterling-Reed
idea will be elected to congress by unsuspecting voters, and if there are
enough of them elected they will enact a law that will destroy freedom
of education in America.	. . .	.
f It becomes the duty, therefore, of the Catholic college student, and
even more so'of the graduate, to inform himself upon the Sterling-
Reed measure and to.observe the activities of its supporters so that he
may do his share in dispelling the indifference and misinformation
which might permit the destruction of American educational freedom.
BE CONSIDERATE
At least seventy, men at, Notre'Dame are not gentlemen. These
seventy, gave a public demonstration of their lack of consideration for
; others in Washington hall on Monday evening. They walked out before
a concert had been finished.	-	.	.
One characteristic of a gentleman is that he' does not; give offense.
He has regard for the feelings of others and he will everi-incommode
himself to spare others pain. .But these men, seventy of them, had no
regard for the feelings of the audience or of the singer. They came,
seemingly, to hear “Mamma Kiss Papa” and “Oh, Sister, Ain’t That
Hot?”’ and when they- heard selections from the classics instead, they
deft Washington hall, for their halls where they might listen to mechan-
ical slam music on a Victrola, or. to. clever mouthings of: fellow devotees
of the clang classics.. For them, in whom the seed of aesthetic appreci-
Nation has. not been cultured, if, indeed, it has ever been planted, “I’m
-Nobody’s Weakness” is superior to “Narcissus,” “Sitting in a Corner”
;is the berries, and the “Bell Song” from Lakme—blah!	‘
:	The concert may not have-been as good as some others, that by
Salvi, for instance, but the singer has a reputation and has power.
Her evident nervousness, much caused by the ungentlemanly conduct
•'of the seventy, did not enable her to do her best. But this is not a
‘place for appraising the virtues of the singer. That has nothing to
do. with the matter.....	:
f It is a trite and a horrid thing to: hark back to: the abused “good
-old days/’ but it;is true that seventy men never .left a. concert in other
- years, and it is to be hoped that they, .will not. do -so again. If they
Avant jazz, they should seek the proper place for it, and so help to
; make.the “good old days” in :this respect be those from- now on.;

THE TURNOVER
“If we have hut the right mind,
all things, even those that hurt us,
help us.” This statement holds out
a promise of great assistance to
those who can understand it, the
hope of finding a universal instruc-
tor. ■ Most of us are undoubtedly
of the persuasion that there are
many things which by no means
help us, but on the contrary, only
do us harm. That too is certainly
the common opinion of men. For
whole books are written to warn us
away from harmful things,—harm-
ful to health, to morals, to Faith,
to success. History is replete with
movements and events, with think-
ers and theories whose influence is
characterized as hurtful, destruc-
tive. . Moreover, every actual (mor-
alist and scientist, philosopher and
pedagog, has his litany of “don’ts.”
feed upon itself, but, like the devil
mentioned in the Epistle, it goeth
about with the’ appetite of a roar-
ing lion seeking whom it may de-
vour. In mental life, more even
than in bodily life, a ravenous ap-
petite is a certain index of robust
sanity.

It would seem, therefore, that
nobody — except possibly the au-
thor of this statement---has- ever
had this “right mind.” :Hence it is
a great pity that he did not. also
tell us just what this rightness of
mind consisted in, and how to: ac-
quire it. In his defense, however,
it may be said that to throw out
such statements and then to leave
them to his students to cogitate up-
on, was quite consistent with the
educational theory of the great
teacher—long deceased—who made
it. For it was he who said also that
“the teacher accomplishes more by
making strong impressions than by
constructing lucid arguments.”
What kind of a mind is a “right”
mind? We take it that a right
mind is one that is first alive and
active, next, alert and eager, and
finally honest and sober. Of course
it-is somewhat of a contradiction
to speak of a dead mind at all. For
mind partakes of the immortality
of the soul. Yet there is, as every-
body knows, a sort of living death^
an habitual mental torpor which re-?
presses thinking in 'such a way as
to render the mind comatose; and
thus to lend it all the attributes of
a-moribund. -- Mental life is mental
activity, that immanent process by
which the. mind sonjehow trans-
forms itself into all things, and ; all
things into itself. A live mind does
not, like the<fa(bled Erisichthon,
To be active and to .be alert are
not necessarily synonyms. In fact,
one may be alert without being, in
the ordinary sense, active at all.
Alertness, merely implies readiness
to act, preparedness for action, and
that along certain very definite and
well-planned lines. Being alive, the
“right” mind is ever hungering for
forage, and being alert, it is ever
in possession of definite objectives
for the expenditure'of its energies.
Add to these qualities, the eager-
ness . and enthusiasm which follow
upon victories achieved, and all
that remains to make a mind fully
“right” and thus able to profit even
by what hurts, is honesty- and so-
briety."	:

said, and, as we believe, truthfully
said, that “it is easier to unite a
hundred hearts than two heads,”
nor could one say that the greatest
obstacle toright thinking is the ten-
dency to accept as true, not what
evidently is so, but what we wish
to be so. ’ Honesty excludes preju-
dice, precipitation and puerility. It
keeps the door of the mind open
and does not close it until each bit
of evidence; is within and has es-
tablished its claim to be there. A
sober mind preserves its balance.
It follows straight lines of thought.
It realizes- when it is carrying a
sufficiently heavy load. Sobriety
keeps the mind’s eye clear, its pas-
sions under control, its judgment
accurate. .	:

Plagiarism ’
“Of all forms of theft,” says Vol-
taire, “plagiarism is the least ^dan-
gerous to society.”- Whether or not
this thought was 1 original "with Vol-
taire ;it is,'of/Course, impossible to
say but it is doubtlessly true.. The
borrowing, of the ideas , of another,
in the English literary world, espe-i
cially, has usually been regarded as
a legitimate means toward, an end
—borrowed thoughts - ’are powerful
stimulants .that insure rapid
growth; they do not,..however, re-
bound to the credit of the borrower
once they are discovered. .. . .
Pope naively explains-. away . his
mild transgressions along, this, line
by saying, “I freely .confess -that. I
have served myself all I could by
reading.”; Truly, “much reading is
like eating,—wholly useless without
digestion.” . r - .. .. f : •
An English critic' of ' the ■ eigh-
teenth century alluded‘to the plag-
iaristic tendencies', of an; unscrupu-
lous borrower as, “the unconscious
sympathy of the mocking bird.” So
long as the plagiarist, merely mocks
the thoughts, , incidents dr plots of
another - his, actions can be; in no
way: extenuated ;but if' he picks -up
a: dull plot or situation- here or
there and redresses with- the spark-
ling gossamer of his own style, pro-
vided he improves it, he is justified.
The- example ' of Shakespeare need
only be cited to meet any objec-
tions to 'this ' argument.. Shake-
speare drew “freely upon the works
of his" forerunners; but he did not
merely transpose 'their thoughts as
did Moliere who used plots and of-
tentimes dialogues, in their entirity,
from Italian plays. .	’ z

At the LaSalle
We have just returned from
“Flaming Passion,” a very mislead-
ing title for anything so conven-
tional as Kathleen Norris’ “Lucre-
tia Lombard,” but we are in no
more condition to give a critical
estimate of it than was Balboa of
his discovery, the Pacific ocean. We
too have made a discovery—at least
we think we have—in the person of
one Norma Sherer, an actress of
the Pauline Garon type. Pauline is
all right, but Norma is one than
whom there is no better. v
-In this picture Norma is in dead-
ly competition with . Irene Rich for
the affections of a young district
attorney, the latest disguise for the
screen’s busiest man, Monte Blue.
Because of the respect in which
Irene Rich has been, held in these
columns in the past, we shall make
no odious comparisons but we shall
say this: if we had been in Monte
Blue’s place, Kathleen Norris would
■ have had to rewrite her story.
Lest we may be accused of incon-
sistency, once having said that the
play was the all-important thing, we
feel that a few words on this’ sub-
ject might be apropo. The story
was probably written to bear out
the contention of an erstwhile
popular song, “Love is Fate.” It
succeeds only in proving that a man
is,more attracted to a woman who
twice faints in his. arms than to one
who is content with the more mod-
ern methods. Outside of this fall-
acy “Flaming Passion” is well
worth seeing, if for no other reason
than to gaze upon our latest dis-
covery.

ommend it.-—E. L.

Professor Cooney
Talks to Daily Men
“Getting out a ‘newspaper is
much more difficult than some peo-
ple realize,” said Doctor John M.
Cooney, Dean of .the Department of
Journalism, to a gathering of the
DAILY staff in the Library'Tues-
day noon.	.
“The criticisms relayed by those
who know nothing of the condi-1
tions under which the DAILY is
printed are unfair.”
And, commenting upon the re-
wards of reporting, he added: “The
DAILY cannot, and does not, at-
tempt to pay its reporters . . . .
and, after all, reporters have other
duties to perform; other things to
do. There are very agreeable
things of a personal character that
the reporter would prefer to do
while he is concerned with the cov-
ering of assignment. (Example:
Writing feature stories that will sell
for real money!) and having no
remunerations for its reporters, the
DAILY must depend solely upon
the enthusiasm of its reportorial
staff.”
The Dean, who is himself a pion-
eer Journalist, regards the small
news items obtained on “beats” of
prime importance. Special assign-
ments and material for editorials
often sprout from “beat items.” On
the average daily -run of “beats”
the least items may give a clue to
the big news that is seldom care-
lessly flung about.
Doctor Cooney , regards- advertis-
ing as one of the main props of the
DAILY. “It is very hard to sell
advertising, but much harder to col-
lect for it,” he said.
Concluding his little ex-temp-talk
with bits of advice to members of
the staff, the Dean said: “Newspa-
per, men should have, an entirely
different fibre; they should not com-
mit the unpardonable sin of being
ordinary: they should be optimistic,
courageous, clean, energetic, and
ever digging for cause and effect.”
The dean was applauded to his
seat, and news from every nook of
the quad immediately gushed forth
from the lips of the assembled re-
porters. The mind of the alert re-
porter fills every web of the charted
“beat” paths. Ari event that’may
appear-trivial on the surface is sel-
dom anything but a hullaluah to the
man properly tuned for editorial
material,* /.feature stories, ' jokes,
and special assignments.

keener interest in reporting, we’ll

ment. Contributors writing anonymously

real names; otherwise their letters can-
not be published.	.
To the Editor/	: -
In the last issue of the DAILY
there appeared an anonymous let-
ter libeling examination morals in
the Law School, a letter written by
some person hiding under the sig-
nature “Z. R. I.” Not only am I
convinced that Z. R. I. did not know
what he was talking about, but also
I' believe that the DAILY was
guilty of profound indiscretion in
publishing such a scurrilous attack,
directed, by inunendo, particularly
at law. students. Having been a
student in the Law School for the
past three years, and having also
been a member of classes in other
departments of the university for
two years, I can honestly say that
cribbing in the Law School is in-
significant compared with that in
other departments. -Since this.is not;
saying much for the Law School, I
shall go further, and say that crib-
bing in the Law School exists in the
lowest-degree possible of being ex-
pected among students anywhere.'
In order, therefore, that Z. R. I.
may be made' to substantiate his
charge, I believe that the DAILY
owes it to the Law School to pub-
lish the real name of Z. R. L in the
next issue of the DAILY. Top
many persons seize their pens.with-
out knowing what they are talking
about.
JOHN N. STANTON.
Editor of The DAILY:
The subject of cribbing reminds
me of a story of a newspaper man
who always wrote his best editorials j
on the laxity in the enforcement of
the prohibition laws, while he was
“three sheets in the wind,” and
had a bottle of good stuff beside
him.	?
It also reminds me of a certain
challenge: “Let he who is. without
sin cast the first stone at her.”

Ancient Book Brought
to Library Recently
“Philobiblon” is the name of a;:
rare and interesting book of the:
twelfth century which has just been
secured for the library through the
efforts of the librarian, Father Paul'
Foik.	: '
The book was written by DeBury,
lord high chancellor of England,
during the reign of Edward III, 300
years before printing was intro-
duced in England. The < copy is
from an American edition of 200
which was recently offered for sale
by G. A. Baker, antique book deal-
er of New York. ;
According to Father Foik, the
book is of so much interest that he
and Father George McNamara, as-
sistant librarian, spent three hours
reading it last Saturday afternoon
and thus missed, the Blue and Gold
track meet in the gym. Father. He-
bert was the next tb read'the book
which is attracting much comment
and is now being eagerly sought by
many members of the. faculty.' r
Speaking of the volume ; Father
Foik said: “In a truly remarkable
manner this book reveals the cul-
ture that existed in mediaeval times
particularly during the - reign of
Edward III.
“It must be remembered that De-
Bury, lived three hundred years be-
fore the beginning of ‘ the classic
renaissance. Yet so full of classic
alllusions is his work that we mar-
vel that a man of his times could
be so erudite. DeBury displays a
learning that would put many a
scholar of the twentieth cenutry.to
shame! The • “Philobiblon” is filled
with metaphors and similes and evi-
dences wide reading on the part ]

WABASH HUMBLES
N D. COURTMEN
PROSPECTS BRIGHT
FOR TENNIS TEAM
Kizer Stars for Notre Dame; Chad-
wick’s Brilliant Floorwork
a Feature.
Marking the fourth Joss in twelve
starts, the Notre Dame basketball
team went down to defeat before
the Little Giants’ aggregation from
Wabash College, 27-22, before a
packed house on the “Y” court
Tuesday night. The downstaters,
although not boasting of an excep-
tionally-brilliant quintet, were able
to master the Irish attack. Taking
advantage of every break, they took
the lead near the middle of the first
half and were never headed from
then on. 1
Notre Dame was unable to score
with any consistency and several
times the Irish failed to follow up
their shots which were being tossed
out of danger by Thorn, the Wa-
bash guard, who played a very ef-
fective game for the visitors. Wa-
bash, on the other hand, employed
a rushing offensive game to good
advantage all during, the game al-
though they frequently experienced
great difficulty in piercing the Irish
defense. '
. Phil Mahoney played a bang-up
floor game for the home contingent.
Kizer was the scoring ace of the
Irish and was almost solely respon-
sible for the closeness of the scores
at the. final whistle. Crowe and
Enright were unable to find them-
selves when the openings came for
shots and the backboard very sel-
dom guided the ball in favor.of the
Blue and Gold. Kizer scored sev-
. " eral beautiful shots from difficult
angles," but the downstaters were
always able to keep several points
ahead of him.
It was an uphill battle for the
Irish, who showed to better advan-
tage during the second half than
they did during the first. They
seemed to find themselves in better
condition to stem the scoring of
the Wabash collegians.
Burdette and Englehart, for-
wards, played well for.Wabash and
contributed 20 points -to the score.
They dribbled and passed in clever
fashion and time after time wove
. through the Irish defense for a shot
at the basket. Chadwick,, the tall
Wabash center, was the fly in the
Irish ointment by virtue of his
great height which enabled him to
keep the ball out of reach of. the
•Irish as weir as knock down their
passes. Chadwick-was injured in
; the last half when he collided with
a Notre Dame player and had to
be, removed from the game.
; The first few minutes of the.
game’ were’slow and devoid of ac-
tion. Wabash began to use the long
- pass and continued to do so during
Matches Scheduled With Indiana
and Michigan; Last Year's
Team Remains Intact.
The tennis team, of last year has
already started practice for the
coming season. The Carroll gym
has been reserved .for the-team be-
tween 2:00 and 4:30 each after-
noon.
Of last year’s team,, which was
the first Notre Dame has ever had,
and which met Michigan and Indi-
ana, every, man is back. . Herman
Centlivre is captain of . the squad,
which is composed of Ed Lutz, Tony
Gonzalez, Harry McGuire, and Mike
Velasco. The prospects for a great
year have been, further advanced
by the acquisition of- Frank Dono-
van, a sophomore who last year as
a freshman won the Tennis Asso-
ciation’s open tournament.
Frank Donovan has been ap-
pointed . acting manager of the
team, and he is: negotiating for
mpny matches. Those' with Michi-
gan and Indiana are certain. .‘Ev-
ery endeavor is being made to have
the crack Texas. University team
come here for a meet.
• Plans are how being formulated
by the Notre Dame Tennis,associa-
tion to sponsor a number of tourna-
ments even greater and better than
those of last year, for which loving
cups and prizes were given that to-
talled over a • hundred dollars in
value. The Athletic department has
also agreed to complete the work on
the four outdoor courts,, which were
put in rough condition last year.'
the Ihttef being a neat left-hartded
passer' and dribbler, who performed
Ris work with remarkable speed.
Thorn, at back guard, was Very ef-
fective in keeping down the Notre
Dame scoring by turning the play
away from the basket at every op-
portunity.
