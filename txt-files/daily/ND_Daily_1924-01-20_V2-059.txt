The villain Exams approaches
stealthily. Long hours therefore
am L preparing for his arrival, put-
ting on the armour of studiousriess
until the witching hour has long
passed. Being so busied with note
books has prevented my being oc-
cupied with the little red book, and
my serious ‘ mein secured in cram-
ming prevents my being mean by
my continual crabbing. I have
much dope on Henry VIII, on the
“Wicked Queen Bess,” on the
manor system in England, on the
exports of Hindustan and African-
istan, but little, you may be thank-
ful, on : the chaps . that roam the
Notre Dame campus.

Due to my late work the other

but still early enough to check in
at 8:55 for my eight o’clock in the

DR. GIODANI TALKS
TO N. D. STUDENTS
South Bend Authority Gives Lecture
Under Auspices tf Department
. of Bacteriology.
Doctor Giodani, head of the med-
ical clinic of South Bend, addressed
a large number of students in Sci-
ence hall yesterday afternoon on
“The Erlich Side-chain Theory and
Some of Its Practical Considre.-
tions.” This lecture was given un-
der the auspices of the Departmen ’
of Bacteriology and arranged by
Father George Albertson.
Doctor. Giodani splendidly dem-
onstrated the Widal test, and .gave
the conclusion of one of the Was-
serman tests that he had made in
his laboratory. He explained very
clearly the processes of his experi-
ment.
An invitation was extended to
the students to visit the medical
clinic by Dr. Giodani. He sug-
gested. that the students spend a
day at the clinic, and by observation
learn the workings of this depart-
ment. :	.	•

The Pipe and Bowl club, recent-
ly organized at Notre Dame, has
jumped into the lead in. the DAILY

early Friday morning and by Sat-
urday noon this club passed the
leaders and now holds a lead of 32
votes over all other campus organ-
izations. Other leaders in . . this
class are the Scribblers with 60
votes and the S.A. C. with 33.	.
The' Toledo club, leader in the
Home Class since the beginning of
the contest, boosted its;total to 67

The New York State club, with-
out a vote yesterday, gained 25 on
Saturday and shot into a tie with
Chicago for second place; Both or-
ganizations are hard-pressed by the
Metropolitan club with 19. votes.
The contest is to close Monday,
January 28 at noon. The winning
clubs will be awarded loving cups
by the follpwing judges: Prof.
George ’ N. Shuster, Father Mul-

K.OFC. INITIATION
TO BE HELD TODAY
Second and Third Degrees Will Be
Conferred on Ninety Candi-
. dates; Banquet to Follow,
The second and third degrees of
the Knights of Columbus will.be
conferred on a class of approxi-
mately ninety candidates at 1:30
o'clock this af'r-)rnoon in Misha-
av aka. Following the. initiation a
banquet will be held in the College
Inn, Hotel LaSalle. '
Included in the class are 75
Notre Dame men who received the
first degree of the order Friday

Plymouth.
The second degree will be con-
fcired by Notre Dame Council No.
J 477. District Deputy Mart Howe
and staff of Chicago "will exemplify
the third degree. The initiation
will be held in the Mishawaka K.
of C. council hall. Notre Dame can-
didates are advised to take the
South Side street car and present
themselves'at'the hallmot later than
1 o’clock.
An excellent program, which will
include an address on “Citizen-
ship” by James C. O’Briep, has been
arranged for the banquet by Lect-
urer Harry A. McGuire. Mr.
O’Brien, who is perhaps better
known as “Ropes” or “Red Neck-
tie” O’Brien, is considered one of
the most forceful speakers of the
middlewest. ’	•

Carroll’s* topic.	;

lain of Notre Dame Council.
, Vocal solos by the Knights of
Columbus quartet, which is comT
posed of Messrs. Koch, Welch,
Rickard and O’Connor, and; musical
selections by Harry Denny’s or-
chestra, are other features of the
program. .	.
Coyne and Moore Tie
■ for Place on Team
The final debate preliminaries
held last night resulted in a dead-
lock, with Philip Moore and William
Coyne tied for the remaining posi-
tion on the team!	.'
These men will enter a second
tryout in the near future, when one
will be selected for the team, and
one will be made alternate;
Paul Harrington was chosen as
the other alternate for the teams
debating the “World Court” ques-
tion.	:	-
The Notre Dame basketball quin-
tet lost to a . wonderful team when
Franklin college .five, the “best
team in the middle-west” let the
Irish eagers down to the tune of
19-12, before a mammoth crowd
of about 1,500 people*, on the “Y”
court last night. Franklin college
retained her unbroken string of vic-
tories while Notre Dame suffered
the third defeat in ten games.
The visiting Baptists ran true to
dope and gave an exhibition of bas-
ketball that would be hard to beat
anywhere in the country. Their
ability to handle the ball with a
smoothness that left little to be
■wished for, combined with their
much-heralded knack of scoring
from any part of the floor, consti-
tuted a problem for Notre Dame-
that they were able to meet only'
with endurance and a determina-
tion’ to hold their own. Franklin
displayed a true eye for the net
while Notre Dame had great diffi-
culty in finding the loop.
Baptists Set Fast Pace
Fate seemed to follow the ball
and on numerous tries for the bas-
jket the ball would; t:|ke a roll
around the rim and fall to the
(floor. The Irish eagers have no ali-
bi. ' rTheir opponents -were a-xvon-
derful team; but if the shots were
counted which Notre Dame’s eagers
tried for the basket only to see
them roll off, there is little doubt
but what the score would have been
a little closer and maybe a little
better. -
The visitors started out with a
fast pace and never let up. • They
employed every formation conceiv-
able on a basketball court, and met
their greatest difficulty in Notre
Dame’s five man defense. ; The
Irish were guarding exceptionally
close and time after time, the Bap-
tists were forced to shoot from the
middle .of the floor. But the fact
that. they. could cage them from
midcourt gave ample . proof that,
they were-easily deserving pL the
reputation which the sporting world
has granted them. -	;
Franklin Takes Lead .
The Franklin team was a quintet
of ball hawks and not infrequently
did they take the ball and do with
it almost as they pleased.: They

SIX HUNDRED AND MORE
The largest collegiate council of the Knights of Columbus in the
world, located here at Notre Dame, will today initiate its six hundredth
member into the mysteries of the order.
That is an event which will be of' interest not only to friends of
these men at Notre Dame, but to their Brother Knights in councils
located in nearly every city of size .from Alaska to Panama, from
the Philippine Islands to Newfoundland. These new Knights, num-.
Bering four score, will enroll themselves in the greatest Catholic lay.
organization in existence. ’	-
A' month from tonight any one of these men may'be cold, and
hungry at Juneau, Alaska,: or friendless at Manila, in the Philippines,
and yet, by reason of the connection he will make today, it will be a
simple matter for him to secure the assistance or friendship of. a true
Catholic gentleman. .	:	.
This is. the advantage'of the order to him. Take the other view,
that of his. value to the council,, and walk for a . moment back through
the battle-fields of Flanders, where the K. C. huts, meant warmth and
foodj’or, if you prefer, go to the chamber of one of our legislatures and
see there some member of this’ great organization , defending the gov-
ernment zandrtlie‘‘Church? from tlie'attacks-of 7God?s''foes.There you*
see the true Catholic gentleman.
Picture after picture might be. called to your mind, regarding the
opportunities the Knights of Columbus offers—the insurance, the study
courses, the associations with men; scene upon scene showing the great
work they are accomplishing—boy relief, care of the sick and injured,
protection of widows and orphans. ' And when you have traveled that
way..and have seen those things, you wilLask.yourself why every.man
at.Notre Dame is not a unit in that order. '.Every first-class man should
be, for his welfare as Ayell as the welfare of Catholicity.
Notre Dame council, The Daily extends to you its sincere con-
gratulations. May yo.ur six hundred soon be sixteen hundred! /
“Genius borrows nobly.” If this
meant that it is a noble thing to
borrow, how many of us would be-
long to the nobility! And. if the
degree of nobility were in direct
proportion to the frequency and
amount borrowed, what a crowd of
major nobles would every commun-
ity not have!' Nothing would be
more common than royalty. And
did the expression mean that noble
borrowing makes genii, how easy it
would be to become a genius! But
the fact seems to be that genii are
not rare because of rare borrow-
ing, nor borrowing .rare because of
noble genii, but simply that noble
borrowing is rare in spite of the
rareness of genii, noble or ignoble.
•••:■- —o—
The expression, being affirmative,
is not exclusive. Hence it should
;be possible to borrow nobly with-
out being a genius. And that raises
the question: - When is borrowing
noble? Usually, though we think,
erroneously, nobility of 'action is
associated. with matters, of consid-
erable_weight, while borrowing gen-
erally involves small sums or trivial
properties. This results from at-
tributing the .'quality of: nobility -to
things, whereas it' is a; quality of
persons and hence of their actions;.
“Adel sitzt im Gemuthe, nicht im
Geblute,” says a German proverb,
which is ably seconded by this other
one: “Adelig und edel sind zweir-
lei.” While of course everybody is
acquainted with “noblesse oblige.”
—o— .	.
It would seem then that one could
nobly borrow even that most insig-
nificant of - borrowed articles,. a
match. Without being too sure of
our ground, we suspect that one
borrows nobly when by the very act
of borrowing- he does honor to the
lender. We heard once of a certain
stage director (in Paris) compelling
a budding actor to receive and re-
turn a snuff-box one hundred and
twenty times before he was satis-
fied that he could do it “to the
.manner. .. born;” Nb_ doubt. in .the
play he was to borrow a pinch from
some one and by so doing reveal
his nobility.

RELIABILITY
■ There may-not be a course in reliability at Notre Dame or at any
> other, university, but any university' should develop a very definite
amount of this in her students. The college, period of a young man’s
life is the formative period. - At this time he should begin to put into
practical use those rules arid guidances by which; he intends to make
his life a success. And surely without reliability .there. is little use of
- aught else'that''a man learnsat school.	.
A concrete example of lack of: this virtue was, it seems, demon-
strated during the Christmas vacation by a number of Notre Dame
men. These men made arrangements for employment down town and
then failed to appear. -True, they might have had good reasons, and
their plans might have been forcibly changed, but that would not pre-
vent them giving due notice to the South Bend-business men who sought
to aid them by giving them work—and they did. not give this notice.
'This does not improve NotreiDame’s standing withi the men of South
Bend who have in the past aided students in ;getting an education at
Notre Dame.	.	i	'-
There is little need to preach what should	be	done;	Every	man
who is at the college stage of life knows his	duty	in	matters	of	thi§
kind.. They need only to be reminded of it.	? ■

Caliban’s Guide to Letters and Lambkin’s
Remains. . Halaire Belloc. E. P. Dutton
and Company. ~
: Hilaire Belloc has written: on
such a profusion of subjects that
as an author he defies, classification.
In this volume/“Caliban’s Guide to
Letters,”, and' “Lambkin’s Remains,’’
he shows himself to be- a'master of
parody-and satireas deft and tren-
chant as Max Beerbohm himself, i
-• “Caliban’s Guide to Letters”
consists'of the supposed literary re-’
mains of James Caliban, a’pompous,
would be literary critic of the mid-
dle class, who, Belloc' assures us
“was-perhaps not the first) but one
of the first, to apply the term
‘Anglo-Saxon’ to the English speak-
ing race—with which indeed he
was personally., connected through
Be that as it may, we never did
have any sympathy with Hamlet’s
“neither a borrower nor a lender
be.” For such a rule is distinctly
anti-social. Moreover, it- is inhu-
man. . It would make for individ-
ualism in society by making every-
body shift for himself, whereas the
natural necessity is that we must
shift for one another. And it would
deprive us of one of the conse-
crated privileges of friendship.. Foi’
a friend is one from whom we may
always freely demand and confi-
dently expect to receive a loan.
—o—
Very likely what Emerson meant
—for it was he who coined the
phrase—was that it . is not deroga-
tory even for a genius to borrow,
and that when he does borrow-some-
thing, he has the candoi* to acknowl-
edge that what he has borrowed is
not his own. Not that ■ Emerson
would insist that were one to wear
a borrowed shirt he should pro-
claim the ; fact to his . neighbors,
but that when one borrows ideas he
should not fail- to use quotation
marks,-—even though it was his
opinion that “quotation confesses,
inferiority.”	; . ,
—o—
Vice is a great borrower. It not
only borrows facts but faces. Its
own face is never presentable to
the public without a .mask of re-
spectability. “So smooth,” says, a
character in Richard III, “he daubed
his vice with.show of virtue.” And
this of course shows us how much
even the noble institution of bor-
rowing may be abused.- Of many
a man and more, women it may, un-
fortunately, be said: “Oh, that de-
ceit should steal such gentle
shapes.” r .
—o—-■
It seems to us that no man will
ever have the courage to overthrow
the practice of borrowing, for it .is
a luxury in which everybody peri-
odically indulges. And whenever
any—luxury . becomes universal, it
ceases to be a luxury and becomes
a necessity. May borrowing be-
come, not. rarer, but only nobler.
his relatives in New Mexico.” -As
further proof of Dr. Caliban’s au-
thenticity, we are further assured,
early in the introduction-, that “the
word ‘Empire’: occurs in a sermon
of his as early as 1869.” 7’■

Editor, The DAILY:
I rise to the defense of the golf-
eri A fiery-blooded gentleman of
’27, in Saturday’s DAILY breaths
golf and “cake-eaters,” and “so-
cial-hound” in the one voice. I
protest! There was a time “way
back when,” when golf was thought
to be a game for infants and old
men. With enlightenment these
days have passed. Golf has come
into its own as a close contender
for the honor of. being the most
popular game in the United States.
It is not exaggeration to say that
more people in the United States
take an active part in golf than in
any other game. Nor is it wrong to
say that golf requires nerve, skill,
practice, and an enthusiasm which
could never be attributed to those
people of whom “Red-Blooded”
speaks so. disparagingly. With
most of his comments I am in . ac-
cord. However, when he insinu-
ates that golf is a game for the ef-
feminate, the corset-wearer, the
tea-hound, the cake-eater, I am in-
dined to rise up and smite him on
. his 46 chest (I might miss his head)
with a mashie,’ or perhaps better, a
mashie-niblick—it is heavier.
“Red-Blooded” is fortunate that
this is not the springtime, for in
the spring the golfer emerges, as
’27 will, see, and he carrieth with
him weapons of wood and steel-—
and a bunker is not the only place
in which these weapons could be
* broken.' ’:	. '	"*	*' ' ''
Repent! Repent! “Red-Blood-

for you have erred. Just in pass-
ing, ,?Red-Blooded,” would^you ac-
cuse Stuhldreher, or . Brown,/or

being effeminate, or of being cake-
eaters?- I wouldn’t, “Red-Blooded,”

ter is probably typical of so-called
“red-blooded he-men.” The major
portion of each comment is irrele-
vant to the discussion. Red-
Blooded ’27 submits a definition of
a “cake-eater” that is so thorough,
that apparently he is the sought-
after authority on this particular
type of individual. Perhaps he is
one. If so, he is the only person at
Notre Dame to whom all these qual-
ities may, be attributed.
Another thing, Freshman; I have
asked questions all my life and as
yet have never been accused of be-
ing backward about asking them.
Therefore why the intimation . of
bravado in desiring a definition of
a “cake-eater.”
As for you Mail Pouch, you seem
to have eliminated logic from your
curriculum. You make the mistake
of hasty generalization, a pitfair of
sound reasoning. You assume be-
cause Endymion suggested the elim-
ination of the term from the cam-
pus vocabulary that it follows his
face could be slapped with impun-
ity. I believe some of the juice of
your Mail Pouch must have glanced
back into you eye. Otherwise I am
at a loss to account for such blind
reasoning.
Mail Pouch ’24 and Red-Blooded
’27, read the letter that started the
discussion and admit to yourselves
that your attitude is uncalled for.
Your assertions smack of the blat-
ant platitudes of the small town
pool room where they are rough,
tough, and nasty, and treat their
women square. .
. There is a remarkable resem-
blance between the letters in that
each is consistently inconsistent. .
ENDYMION.
Editor, NOTRE DAME DAILY:
I am enclosing a recent editorial
from the Chicago Tribune which I
believe will set Endymion’s mind at
rest bn the' subject of “Cake-eat-
ers.” It follows:
“More About Yale
“Now that the tumult and shout-
ing over Walter Camp’s all-Ameri-
can or all-Yale eleven has quieted,
it. is an appropriate time to call at-
tention to the fact; that Yale fur-
nishe(L.the. model.after_which_model
colleges, including Harvard, have
been formed.	'
“Within memory of living man,
when western, colleges were eggs,
Harvard and Yale filled the college
world as land and sky fills the hori-
zon.- •	.	, -

ing aristocratic society. College of-
fices, club memberships and football
positions went to the scions of those
New England families which had
established themselves as a ‘mer-
chant upper class’ in the revolu-
tionary days.
“To this college flocked the sons
of the rich, seeking the Harvard
manner, the Harvard polish, and the
Harvard voice.	--
“Yale harbored a boisterous crew
of farmers’ sons. : In its bleak, ill
lighted, and unheated halls was
small opportunity for the niceties.
It knew little of the works and life
of Franklin, but worshiped the epi-
gram and death of Nathan Hale.
Place on the football team, in col-
lege office, and secret societies went
to the low of brow, heavy of hand,
and swift of limb.
“Two college civilizations were in
rivalry. In scholarship and debate
aristocracy triumphed, but in phys-
ical contest, democracy won. Then
it was the Hogans, Hefflefingers,
and Hinkeys rolled the Hallowells,
Newells, and Cabots in muddy de-
feat while illiterate undergraduates
worked themselves into frenzy
chanting ill selected words set to
the tune of the Prussian national
hymn.	-
“Such sporting writers as the
day afforded were awed by the for-
titude of the' men in blue.
“They coined the phrase ‘Yale
Spirit,’ as synonymous of uncon-
querable determination, and made
the Bulldog, an animal of more
courage than refinement, the sym-
bol of the college. '
“As the western colleges came
into being they drew their faculties
from the more erudite and cultured
of eastern pedagogues, but where,
except in female seminaries, have
professors influenced undergradu-
ate life? .
, “The new colleges took their tone
from that old one which scored the
most touchdowns. They sent for
Yale coaches. Men like Stagg and
Williams taught more than foot-
ball. They taught a standard for
young manhood.
“Scholarship protested; it called
football brutal, demanded its abol-
ishment, introduced * 'co-educatio'n7

“Huh,” says the Editor, “here’s
a good one. Hot stuff for a fea-
ture right here,” and he turns to
me. “Trek around the campus a
few times and get the gossip in
support of this article. It says
that English as written and spoken
today has it . all over the alumni
brand. Snap it up.”
Away we pad in search of a vic-
tim. At last we manage to corner
a fourth year fondling long enough
to hand him the old line of gravy.
“Oh, the Queering Reporter?” he
asks. “First you want the mono-
gram and course I’m fussing.”
Finally after persuading the bim-
bo we didn’t want his handle as
much as his opinion, he spiels off.
“Better English? Why the present
day line is the horse’s knuckles.
This baby can give the old man
three west winds and a Mah Jongg
and let off a line that’ll daze him.
Nothin’ to it.” ■	-

thinking, perhaps, that petting par-
ties would supplant athletics.
“But young manhood stood up
for masculine principles. A few
Yale institutions, such as hurdling
the line, the flying tackle, and other
bone breaking plays, were outlawed.
Forward passing was introduced
from the girls’ game of basketball
as a compromise, and the Yale view
of college life settled into perma-
nence.	.	.
“Harvard fought a hard fight
with herself, won it, and then for a
decade or more turned the table on
her teacher. -
“The college had withdrawn from
sport under leadership of the aris-
tocracy, but her proletariat forced
a reentry. A civil war veteran
founded the Harvard Union. A
salaried coqch was employed, west-,
ern men were allowed on the team,
and. Yale’s athltic empire was over.

Finally we winds up an old prof
and lets him unreel. .	.	.
“English is getting to be the bee’s

wonders. The first day they start-
ed reading ‘The Merchant of Ven- ‘
ice’ they had every bozo figured
out. They put .Portia in short

lish is; as pure as Ivory. I.guess
;they get that way by associating
with their profs. I don’t know no
one else that can make ’em such
spider’s toes when it comes to this
here English language.”	.
“But Harvard today is more like
the Yale of the ’90s than herself in
that decade.	. '
“Yale’s athletic supremacy ffias,
gone, as a father’s dominance over
his.grown son, but-its work is done.
“Yale has made the American

produce men, not students. . .

WATER CARNIVAL
HEED AFTER-EXAMS
' Tank Men Show Great Progress
Since Opening of Pool, at -
South Bend “Y.”
Notre Dame’s Water carnival, to
be given by the members of the
swimming squad, bas been post-
poned until after the semester ex-
, aminations. The delay in giving
the exhibition was caused by the
limited time allowed the commit-
tee to complete preparations for
the event, and the nearness of the
coming meet with'the. Fort Wayne
Y. M. C. A. at the “Y” natatorium
in that city on the evening of Feb-
ruary 1.
Goss’ tank men have showed
much progress since the opening
contest of the season with the
South Bend “Y;” By obtaining the
privilege of using both the South
Bend public natatorium and the
varsity pool, the squad has been
given the advantage of working out
under a variety of conditions. Prac-
tice, is being held every day at the
South Bend pool and at the Univer-
sity tank. Weekly inter-team meets
are held regularly to stimulate in-
terest and to push the men to their
best in tank performances.
The tank record board, to contain
the records in all events made at
the University pool, will be in read-
iness within a short time and will
be placed in the tank house.
The schedule for the week calls
for the entire team to practice at
the South Bend pool on Monday,
Tuesday and. Wednesday, and at
Notre Dame oh Thursday and
Friday. An important meet-
• ing of the team will be held in
room 123, Administration building
at 12:30 Monday. Coach Goss an-
nounced that, a full attendance is

Sidelight on Phase of
Dr. Egan 9s Character
Maurice Francis Egan was Am-
bassador to, Denmark at the time
Dr. Cook arrived in Copenhagen
after his “discovery of the' North
Pole.” Because of the 'bond be-
tween Maurice Francis Egan arid
Notre Dame the following, from
Robert Underwood Johnson’s auto-
(Continued, from Page 1.)
entered the game "with an eagle eye
for Crowe and Kizer, and they
guarded these two men relentlessly.
- Franklin jumped into an early
lead of three points shortly, after
the game started and. were never
headed by the Irish from then on.
They gave a sweet exhibition of the
court game in the first half and
forced Notre Dame to guard: with
the gif,ea$est carefulness. . The
slightest opening and the visitors'
wove through to the basket with a
flash of speed. They. employed
their team work to the greatest ad-
vantage, and after the first half
was but a few minutes old, it was
easily seen that Notre Dame would
have to do some clever basket
shooting if they were to beat the
downstate ’aggregation.
Several times in this frame, the
Irish revealed flashes of their early
season form and toyed with the ball
around the opponents’ basket, but
were unable to sink the leather.
Mahoney Is Star
Crowe had apparently lost, his
basket eye and pitted against this
brainy outfit, the Irish star was un-
able to register more than one field,
goal and one free throw. Phil Ma-
honey was the shining light of the
struggle, playing his usual stellar
brand of .. defensive. ball.11 Phil
counted for a total of five points.on
the score sheet, being the high-
point man on the Notre Dame five.
'The fast offensive work of the
visitors, coupled with their clever
team work, served to keep the Irish
away from the basket and the pro-
teges of Keogan were making the
best-of their, opportunities from all
parts of the floor. :	;
The half ended with Franklin on
the long end of a 14-8 score. When
the second half opened the action
was slow. Notre Dame was playing,
a strictly defensive game, and the
Baptists -played a'rou(nd with the
ball in their own territory waiting
for an opening to break through the
Maylmen. Here again they dis-
played some of the fine points of
the game, showing remarkable abil-
ity to' weave in and out of the Mayl-
men with-great speed and suddenly
take the leather and rush through
for a shot.
Free Throws on Par
Notre Dame lost several more
shots for the vistors’ basket in this
period,and were playing desperate-
ly against a team that had the edge
all the way. Consistency was the
mark of the visitors, and they
proved it? They showed little bet-
ter advantage than Notre Dairie in
the matter of free throws and made
only three out of seven while the
Irish registered two out of seven.
Franklin’s forwards played a
great game but facing the air-tight
defense of the Maylmen, they did
not see as much of the basket as
advanced dope claimed they would.
Vandivier was the high point man
with three field goals and two foul
goals. . .	?	'
Gene Mayl, the Irish leader, reg-
istered one tally for the home’five
and played a real fighting game.
Kizer and Crowe were marked men,
'and both were unable to find the
basket , with the regularity with
which they have been credited.
Riordan at. the pivot post played a
splendid: floor game, while Phil
Mahoney gave everything he/had to
stop the onrush of the visitors, and
will bear careful watching when the
Irish play the return game at the
end of the season.
Senator. Bob Proctor and.Knute
Rockne issued the monogram sweat-
ers to the 1923 football men be-
tween halves. Tremendous applause
greeted the appearance of each
player.	.

did exactly what was proper for
