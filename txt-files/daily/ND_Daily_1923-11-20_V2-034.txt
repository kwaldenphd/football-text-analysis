Monogram Coats

Attention to the ruling of the
Athletic Board regarding the wear-
ing of monograms by students who
have no right to do so was called
yesterday by Rev. Joseph Burke, di-
ricetor of studies.
'A number of students have pen-
ciled or inked monograms on the
back of sheep-skin coats and rain
coats.. In accordance with the rul-
ing of the athletic board these, and

COLDLY REALIZED DEGREES
f/That there exists on the campus the thing we shall call intellec-
tual apathy will get the affirmation of the average Notre Dame man
: who has ' lived here awhile, if he will be .candid. It evidences itself in
a pitiable listlessriess in class; This is not to say that subjects handled
by: exceptidriably' able men do not elicit enthusiasm; nor that extra-
ordinary students are not to be seen in every classroom. What we mean
isithat our meh are.not in top-form scholastically. Right here we may
be told that such a state of. affairs is not peculiar to 'Notre Dame; you
find it at most institutions. We do riot care about that. Why does
vitiating indiffereiice fbiist bn our eave-troughs?	-
Certainly it is not the fault of the individuals who comprise the
faculty. Their scholarship needs rio eulogy; they are eager and inter-
-esting. - We like them, their methods, and would like to know them
better. The man who . holds a. professorship at Notre Dame can be
( .counted on to show himself a good'fellow at all times—^a man whose
human qualities are consonarit with his erudition and whose fairness
• arid generosity-get too little recognition.
/ When' you analyze apathy you find, it comes either from helpless-
ness or lack of inspiration. You have only to talk a little with a rep-
resentative undergraduate, and be convinced of a kind bf futility in the
inan’s attitude. .• Go a bit deeper, and .you -will find he is .carrying, too
much work,-andjn this we-are n4ot-trjang-to be-funri^^^^	-■ .
' They say who know least about it that the Arts courses offer the
•softest way to a degree. The fact is that A.fts and Letters men are
the most pathetic • victims' of overwork. Engineers, to a less extent,
Commerce men, arid Lawyers, have a certain well-surveyed tract of
knowledge to cover. You get through it or not aiid after you arc
through you can sell what you have learned for a substantial piece
-.of: coin.’ .■	. r' ■
.. . . In the case of students; of the humhhities, the thing is riot quite
so simple. Class work does not mean much. It only constitutes some-
thing of a stimulant (arid stimulants are artificial) to a natural appetite
for learning. These men must do most of their work inside. Departing
from the. rule of invidious allusions, let us say no man can honorably
hold a Litt.B. degree who has not read Plato’s Dialogues.
The point is then that we have too many classes, so many in fact
that we do not get time to do more than outlirie the subject. , How
many.devotees;of Economics have read Las Capital or The Wealth of
Nations?. How.many men out for a Ph.B. have read Lirigard or Goethe
dr Moliere? JWe_will admit that wide reading does not make culture,
but you cannot have culture without wide reading.
We .submit then: .Reduce the maximuni class hours from 24 to,

AT THE PALACE
The motion picture offering at
the Palace, James Kirkwood in
<<The Eagle’s Feather,” had ap-
proximately the same .amount of
entertainment in it as had the
.‘•Topics of the Day,” which follow-
ed it. It was good'in spots, in
other spots not so good.
Having remained through the
movie, • we were rewarded -by the
sight of Harriet Seeback, who sang
a song or two by way of introduc-
tion to an exhibition of bag punch-
ing at which she and the other
member of the team, Harry See-
back, were unusually adept.
Cissie Shannon came second on
the bill. Her act was featured by
|he rather good dancing of her un-
programnied partner.
Came Karyl Norman, the ' Cre-
ole fashion plate,' who, up to the
night before had been with the
Greenwich Follies. The impersona-
tions were excellent, .the songs—
all of which the audience was told
are. new—were not extraordinary.
Karyl Norman has stage personal-
’ ity, is not a bow stealer, and is will-
ing to share applause as witness the
fact that he introduced his pianists
to the audience.
: James H.-Cullen scored what was
perhaps the popular hit of the after-
noon with his songs which he sings
as no one else could sing them, and
with a few old epitaphs which were
well received by the audience not-
withstanding their age.
Harry ' Waiman and His Depu-
tantes closed the bill. The mem-
bers . of his; orchestra were capable
musicians, Waiman himself is a
good violinist, and the act was well
set. His program was well-balanced
with- the one exception that it con-
tained too many “Yes We Have No
Bananas.”

What They Say
NOTRE DAME SPIRIT.
Even though it was a bitter cup
for the Notre Dame students, the-
fair attitude taken by the Notre
Dame Daily certainly merits praise
from Nebraskans who have felt
that articles from the hand of some
nationally known writers were not
giving the Cornhuskers due credit
for winning the game last Satur-
day. A paragraph from the story in
the paper follows:
. “The Cornhuskers had ;a
wonderful team that played
the game as they never played
it before. Not once did they
let up on their smashing line
attack, and with the advan-
tage of weight, they crushed
the Irish defense.”
There is no attempt in that
statement to say that. Notre Dame
was wander-weary, that her sched-
ule was top-heavy, or that the Irish
were off form. That is the inter-
collegiate spirit that has put college
football far above the reach and
danger of professionalism.
Again the Daily gives the Huskers
defensive a compliment and attrib-
utes . Notre Dame’s inability to
score to the Husker.line.
.“The Irish backfield played
a. fighting game, and tore
through the Cornhusker line
and ran the ends with lightning -
speed, but the. Nebraska team
were tackling as mad men and
it was impossible to make con-
sistent gains against such- des-
. jperate, playing.”
The ability of the Cornhuskers to
intercept the famous Notre Dame
pass .was commented upon by the
writer in the following lines:
“Both teams played a pass-1
ing and running game till
nearly the end of the period,
with the Cornhuskers display- :
ing an uncanny adroitness to.

intercept the Irish passes,
was one of the surprises of the
game.” -
As one of the greatest tributes
that-the defeated can offer, Notre
Dame relinquished all, claim to the
honor, that goes to the victor in the
following:' .	-
“The struggle between these
two great rivals was won and
lost on the breaks of the game'.
Two wonderful teams pitted all
they had on the altar of the
pigskin for that priceless glory
that is Nebraska’s today.”
Thus, Notre Dame, as .honorable
a football team as ever played the
Cornhuskers, refutes the. jargon
launched by the champions for her
cause, in a few lines that indicate
that Nebraska’s opponent of a week
ago seeks to grant honors without
alibi. The friendship that has
grown in the nine years of annual
battles was strengthened by that
sportsmanship displayed when the
world was psychologically fit for a
torrent of alibis from the defeated.

------ON TO PITTSBURGH-
SHAKESPEARE
AS IF LIVING
Mr. Bucknell Makes a Plea for the
Reading of Literature with
Enthusiastic Mind..
Classism is the brand of death to
literature, said Professor William
Bucknell to his class in Shake-
speare yesterday. Mr. Bucknell
was making a plea for an under-
standing of the universality of lit-
erature, for a recognition of the
closeness of literary appeal.
“Human nature has always been
the same,” he said, “and was por-
trayed the same in the Greek plays
of thousands of years ago, and in
the plays of Shakespeare hundred
of years ago.” He recommended
■that the works be read as if they
were contemporary, as if they were
■written by a living author, “as in-
: deed, they -were, for- their authors
were immortal.” The habit is,’ Mr.
Bucknell said, to - treat “Shake-
speare with a curious kind of re-
moteness.”
He read from a recent article
written , by a prominent book pub-
lisher as further comment on his
remarks. “They (the students)
have studied Shakespeare. • So it is
with the fest of the masters: they
are unloved masters, so far as they
concern the average student,
equipped with only the impedimenta
of literary names and dates. . . .'
Students are set.to reading class-
ics as a duty rather than a pleas-
ure. . . . The masterpieces are re-
duced to the dull level of text-
books. They are divided into a
series of cold, compulsory tasks.”
“I should like to see a study, of
the Miracle plays,” Mr. Bucknell
said, “but . to have them studied I
would not have them put on a colT
lege curriculum. That would be a
means of killing all. interest in
them.” -
“There is a cold, unwholesome
awe of,the great literary masters,”
-Mr. Bucknell went on, reading
again from the article, “as of per-
sonages not quite human and un-
derstandable. Remote and austere
are Shakespeare, Sterne,’ Dickens
and all their glorious company.” He
contrasted their popularity with the
people of their own age, how
Shakespeare played 'to crowded
houses, and how the Londoners of
that day asked one another if they
had seen .Falstaff, the funniest fel-
low ever seen on a stage, with the
present awe and dislike. Mr. Buck-
nell , recommended that the student
turn to the artists with an enthus-
iastic mind, by which the magic of

“Why should Shakespeare be
made a stupid image, set up to ter-
rify—he, whose brain was the very
microcosm of humanity, who has
told us simply that ‘All the world’s
a stage and all the men and women
merely players’,” he read. “The
student, regarding with a dull and
distant reverence the masters of lit-
erature, has not been taught that
the great are simple; that these
^masters, by virtue of their mastery,
-make the most direct and irresisti-
ble appeals to the human heart. He
does not, know that in the pages of
these masters there are laughter
and tears, men and women, day and
night, all the vigorous, changeful
round of living—that here, in short,
are the greatest stories ever told.”

reason why he should not take part

Father , Burke said that it would

most difficult. While Engineering is
considered by many to be the most
difficult, there are no more failures
in that course than in any other.
