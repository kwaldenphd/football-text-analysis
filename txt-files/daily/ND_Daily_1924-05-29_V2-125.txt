IRISH PLAY RETURN GAME
WITH MICHIGAN AT
ANN ARBOR
. Coach Keogan’s baseball team
will meet the University of Mich-
igan nine on the Ann Arbor dia-
mond this afternoon in the second
game to be played between the two
schools this year.	-
Magevney -will be on . the mound
for Notre 'Dame and the Irish are
hopeful for another victory over
the Maize and Blue. The Wolver-
ines have taken a new lease on base-
ball life since their first meeting
with Notre Dame, and the Michigan
ball tossers.are as confident of vic-
tory as. are the Notre Dame men.
The Irish have displayed a huge
supremacy over the conference
teams thus far this, year and the
figures on paper give Notre Dame
a wide margin .of victory over the
best in the Big Ten circuit. •
Fitzpatrick Downs
Gdhlic in Finals
In the only finals match of the
different flights played yesterday in
the golf tournament, Edward Fitz-.
Patrick of Walsh hall triumphed
in class B flight over Leo Johlic of
Freshnian hall 6 up and 4 to go.
Fitzpatrick displayed a winning
game' from the first tee and • the
result was never in doubt. Johlic,
however; exhibited some very good
shots which won a-few holes for
himL. -Fitzpatrick,r=7foryhis ; efforts,!
won a MacGregor driver whicli wasT
donated by the Meyer hardware and
sporting goods store. Johlic, the
runner-up, was awarded- a pair of
golf shoes donated by the Leroy
Clauer sporting goods store. -
In the: championship flight, be-
tween Joseph DiLeo of Brownson
hall and John Bulger of the day
students, an unsettled argument
which took place on the 18th hole
about the number of holes to be
played, made it impossible' to de-
cide or declare the 'winner.
; ’ In the other .flights,, the rounds
have been played ‘more slowly and
_it is doubtful if the finals will be
reached before the first of next
week.'	‘	.

NOTRE ..DAME; ..CARDINAL
O’CONNELL TO PRESIDE
The formal presentation1 of the
Laetare medal of'the University to
Charles Donagh Maginnis of Boston,
distinguished Catholic architect, will
take place at Boston College,
Boston, Mass., on Sunday morning.
, Rev. Matthew Walsh, president
of the University, yesterday - an-

dean of the commerce school and
prefect of religion, had been named
to represent the University' at the'
ceremony, which will . be presided
over by His Eminence, William
Cardinal O’Connell, of Boston. •
Mr. Maginnis was' honored ■with
the award on Laetare Sunday in 1
March, but the presentation of the
medal, according to custo'm, was
not made at that time. Mr. Ma-
ginnis was -unable to come to the
University, so the award will be
made in the east.	•

ranged will be similar to that which
marked the presentation to 'Attor-
ney .Walter George Smith of Phil- '
adelphia, since deceased, here last
November.’	•
Mr. Maginnis has long been a .
conspicuous figure in American
architecture, doing tremndous things
for the preservation of the rich’
architectural tradition of the
Church. .	'	,	.

THE DAILY’S STAND FOR NOTRE DAME
A union building to be built as soon as possible. \	'.
A well-organized student body, residing on the campus. •
True recognition of good scholarship and- a better appreciation
for the efforts of men in campus activities.
“Outside The Law,” a crook melo-
drama featuring Priscilla Dean and
Lon Chaney will be revived at the
Oliver. Although the picture is by
no means a late release, it is still,
entertaining.
The famous Edicon Record Art-
ists and Joe Thomas Sax-o-tet willi
compete for high honors' on the)
Blackstone stage. Mary Roberts
Rinehart’s play, “The Breaking
Point,” promises something novel in
the story of the hero’s double life
and love affairs.
Alma Neilson, dancer, and her
jazz band will probably carry away
the .major share of the laurels at
the Palace. “Second Youth” opens
as the feature picture with Walter
Catlett, a leading actor in “Sally.”
“Why Men Leave. Home” . will
continue at; the .Orpheum until Sun-
day. Helene Chadwick and Lewis
Stone, as a married couple, travel
through an amazing series of inci-
dents to find a happy ending to their
omic drama of married life.’
One month from next Saturday,
Notre Dame will celebrate the fif-
ty-third anniversary of the building
of the Church of the Sacred Heart
of Jesus. The corner stone was
laid by Archbishop Purcell of. Cin-
cinnati, June 31, 18,71. The (foun-
dations, however, were laid two and
a half 'years earlier, on the Feast of
the Immaculate Conception, De-
cember 8, 1868;
The church,: which is built in the
form of a Latin cross and is 275
feet in length and 114 feet in width
at the transept,' contains a chancel
and a', total, of twenty-two chapels,
with seven: apsidal chapels. • The
42 large windows contain 114 life
size pictures and 106 smaller ones.
Mother Eleanor, of the Carmelite
nuns at Le Mans, France, conceived
the ideas for and supervised’ the
making of the windows.
Particularly notable are the Sta-
tions of the Cross and the frescoes,
which are the work of Luigi Gre-
gori, who was at the University
from 1874; to 1891? Th^ twelfth
and thirteenth stations were . exhi-
bited at the World’s Columbian Ex-
position, Chicago, 1893.
In the arched recess behind the
main altar, is the rear altar, which
was carved by Bernini in. the sev-
enteenth century’and is the only ex-
ample of Bernini’s art in America.
Perhaps the best work of the altar
represents golden1 cherubs support-
ing the crucifix.
COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY—-The
Columbia oarsmen are practicing
daily on the Harlem and the Hudson
rivers in an effort to retain the
Child’s cup, despite the fact that
the final examinations are- in full
swing. The race with Princeton and
the University of Pennsylvania.for
the trophy is scheduled'- to take
place on the Schuylkill river at
Philadelphia a week from Saturday.
The United States Naval Academy
eight has been added to the pro-
if they finish first, they are not

to receive the trophy.1
WELLESLEY COLLEGE-Welles-

THE LEAGUE’S COURT.
After a great deal of hem-hawing and gesticulation in the Senate a
-new resolution of the stature establishing the world, court has been pre-
pared for America’s acceptance by Senator Pepper. When presenting
this .new form of court for the foreign relations, committee to adopt, the
Senator informed it that the court? as he, proposes it, has been so thor-
oughly revised that it is entirely dissociated from the league.
Under, the. old form, of, the court/the judges'are elected • by/the
■ . council and the-assembly of- the league /undersSenator Tep'pef^
. - sal the judge's will be selected by an assembly of all nations joining!the
• - - court and by an electoral council composed of ten 'states, of which the
United States should be'a member. Really there is no .difference be-
tween the two ’plansTin the election of the judges—itt only sounds dif-
ferent and more advantageous to the United States. . This is so because
those nations, represented in the council and the< assembly of -the league
that now. the judges, are the same nations, represented in the court that
' will elect them under. Senator Pepper’s plan; and if the.senator is try-
ing to destroy, the election power the council and the , assembly of the
league because he sees evil therein, the evil does not disappear merely
bcause the same electors are clothed in different gowns. .
Again, under-the present authority the j court is the compulsory
legal advisor of the league on. any question of ah international nature
referred to it by the league.. Tlie Pepper resolution disclaims for the ।
United States all responsibility for;any such opinions. But the fact
remains that the court-is still detailed to advise the league, and. even be-
fore Senator Pepper advanced his proposal,, everyone understood that
the court lacked any power to enforce its decisions, not only on the
United States if Americans saw fit to disagree with the court, but upon
any of• its thirty^five members, Albanians, Lithuanians, (Venezuelans,
and the others? - In reality, then/ Senator -Pepper has nothing new to
>- offer as a world court arid his proposal appears to ;be nothing more, than
, -a political issue,. "His party realizes that there are essentially two
1 groups in this country that iriust be satisfied in the riext presidential
campaign—those who are in favor of joining the court beca,use they
know it will eventually bring them into the league,'and those who don’t
want to join the league through the court—arid his party intends to
satisfy both of; them; The pro-leaguers kho'w'the world court .is being
I . ■	used as.an instrument and servant of,.the league and they, therefore, will
/ support Senator Pepper’s party. Theanti-leaguers, eager: to kill tlie
■ league ,and not noticing the ambiguity of Senator Pepper’s- plan) will
, ’ also lend his party their support and a short time thereafter, as surely
: . as the political machinery continues to revolve, the United States will
be drawn into the league. ',

As the school- ^year draws .to a

a tendency among college men to

plenty of time for this after grad-
uation, but while an undergraduate,
it seems as if a touch of ’the “flan-,

N. D. Golfers Meet
•	„ Indiana Here Today
■ ~ ■ ■ ", ■■ ।
The high point of the Notre Dame
golf schedule will be ,reached this
afternoon,, wlien the Irish linksmen
meet the University of Indiana
quartet on the Chain o’ Lakes course
in a thirty-six hole match today.
. .The, varsity..golf team, managed
by George Ward and captained by
Jack Adams, have played through
a season marked with unusual suc-
. cess, considering that this is the
first year Notre Dame has been rep-
, resented in collegiate golf conipe-
tition. The opening match of the
' season was lost to Northwestern
by the.margin of one point but the
next three matches with DePaul,
Loyola and Culver were won by de-
cisive scores. Both' Northwestern
and Indiana are among the head-
liners in the conference golf cor-
. cuit arid figuring on the . unexpected
showing made by Notre Dame
against1 Northwestern,' the match
this afternoon is doped to be a nip
and' tuck affair for Indiana.
A The morning round will call for
, ’ ' 18 holes of single match play while
1 the program for the afternoori pre-
scribes' another 18 holes with the
best two. ball foursome. Efforts are
' being made to ." complete arrange-
' - ments for' a date with the DePaul
quartet for a match ' oh the • local

URBANA, Ill.,ri May 28.—Harold
Osborne, former Illinois university
high. jumper arid now competing
with the I. A. C., established a new
world’s high jump record at 6 feet,
8 1-4 inches in the Olyiripic try-
outs being'held here.- The former
record was held by Beeson of Cali-
fornia at 6 feet, 7 5-16 inches.
- Officials of the A. A. U. measured
the jump and announced'that, the
mark would be accepted as a new
world’s record. Officials of the
Olympic games' committee have
questioned Osborne’s style of jump-
ing, but it is believed certain that’
he will be permitted to compete in
the Olympic games.

more in; the third, while Badin was
failing to connect with Eirk’s'slants.

Oberst and Lieb Go
to Olympic Trials
In the Olympic trials which are
scheduled to he staged at Ann Ar-
bor tomorrow and Saturday, Notre
Dame will be represented by Oberst-
in ,the javelin arid probably Kennedy
in' the mile run. Tom Lieb will
compete with the I. A. -C. in the
discus throw.
While Captain Kennedy will meet
some very strong competition in
the mile run, Oberst , and Lieb are
figured to set up new marks in their
respective events. Lieb unofficially
broke :the korld’s discus record in
an exhibition at the state meet last
Saturday, when he hurled the weight
158 feet, 10 inches? The world’s
mark stands at 156 feet, 4 inches.
Notre Dame’s great track and foot-
ball star won the national title in
the A. A. U. meet held on Stagg
field last summer with a heave of
151 feet, 4 inches. In practice dur-
ing the past few weeks, Lieb has
hurled the weight with consistency
in the vicinity of 150 feet, occas-
ionally bettering his own official
record. His record breaking throw
of last week promises to be repeated
again at the Olyfnpic trials. Lieb
is. regarded by track experts of the
country .as the premier. American
discus man. Several, noted coaches
have picked him to win over the
great- Finnish athlete who is re-
ported to be’ throwing the weight

What They Say
COLLEGE SOCIAL AFFAIRS
' In the college , and university so-
; cial life of Indiana the time has
come to observe certain trditions.
At one,school there may be a junior
' prom, at another a Panhellenic
ball, arid the sororities and fratern-
ities are giving their farewell dances
for the year. The public ' learns
that professional decorators have
been lavish in displaying their skill.
On orchestra of many pieces has
been imported from some distant
city. The favors are unique and ex-
pensive. The direct cost must be
heavy. The collateral • expense is
no small item. Every girl who
goes must have a new gown, or at
least makes an effort to get one.
'An undergraduate in one of the
men’s colleges of Indiana has \yrit-
ten. to the institution’s paper, pro-
testing against the mounting cost
of social affairs; In that school
this spring the big dance of the
season will cost $15 for tickets, and
• that is only part of the total out-
lay necessary. More .than 150 girls
had to be brought to town to give
each man?a partner. The travel
‘ expense, the new clothes, the en-
tertainment, etc., must have run
. the-individual expense for this one
dance up to what not long ago would
have seemed an extravagant sum.
Rivalry is old and so is competi-
tion. Both are to blame to a con-
siderable extent for the present con-

Gene Oberst is due to repeat his
performance which broke the state
record last Saturday. While his
work' in the Ann Arbor . trials is
not expected to be greatly pushed
by other collegiate competition, the
final trials at Boston will force the
Kentuckian to the utmost unless he
is registering a mark well over the
200 feet consistently. The class of

at Boston next month for the final

dition of college society. There is
a disposition to make this, year’s
affair cost more than last year’s.
The committees provide more dec-
orations, a' bigger orchestra, more
elaborate favors arid so on. At
some of the dances two orchestras
fiave been- engaged, so that the
dancing .may be continuous. One
orchestra plays while the other gets

Freshman Number
of Chimes Issued
The Freshman number of the St.
Mary’s Chimes will make its ap-
pearance on the St. Mary’s campus
today. During the course of the
year there have been • issues rep-
resenting each class in the college
and the Frosh number is equal to
any of the previous issues. The
features of the “Chimes” are an
interesting short story by Miss Isa-
belle Hamilton and a forceful essay
on “Principles and War” by Miss
Inez Hayes.
Two pages are devoted to fresh-
man verse. The ten verses which
are printed reflect creditably upon
the efforts and ability of the writers.
The editorial pages contain sev-
eral cogent articles. “Velocity of
Present Day Living,” by Miss Char-
lotte Foster deals very cleverly with
the present “acceleration of living?’
