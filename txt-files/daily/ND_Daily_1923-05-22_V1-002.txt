POLITICS AND HUMOR
A United States senator, prominent in the politics of the Middle
West, once made the astonishing assertion that he had experienced more
dirty , and unscrupulous politics in his college days than he had during
his later career in the field of national politics. This interesting state-
ment, coming from a great statesman, should furnish aspirants for col-
legiate class honors and their constituents with material for solid
thought which should bring about a change of tactics in pre-election
campaigns. Political battles at Notre Dame are not as intriguing as at
most colleges and universities, yet certain abuses are,creeping in which
it is well, to stem before they become gross evHsT^Thei very nature of
Notre Dame and the democratic spirit of good fHowship, which prevails
should preclude small-town politics. -■	'	\ ■
The trend of class, politics'at Jtl^ University in the. past four years
has been interesting, and provocative of many a hearty laugh from those
have watched-ths p.roc&edings from avantagc, point. The_present
election system, which provides for a period of two days between the
nomination and election of officers, while it is advantageous in some
ways, has introduced many absurdities. We designate them in this-way
because they are too inane to be called evils. The verbosity of.ululant
politicians; the distribution of cigars, and cigarets .by the candidates;
the. well-oiled and smoothly operating political machines; the hearty
handshake and the “hale fellow well met,” benign, but condescending
and hypocritically hearty, pat on/the back—are all ridiculous enough;
but the broadcasting of false propaganda and misrepresentation of the
good character of the candidates is more than that—it is vicious! Wild
efforts of this sort to influence the opinion of the student electorate are
an evidence of the fact that many students are taking class politics
too. seriously.	•	-
Partly.responsible for’this was the advice which a freshman class
was proffered unwisely sometime ago; It was told that “politics is fos-
. tered at Notre Dame”: and urged: to “get out and talk it up.”. The
advice was well-intentioned, but the. result was the inception of soap
s box oratory at. the University and other very questionable methods to
corral votes. Of course these individuals made laughing stock of them-
’ ■ selves and usually dost out in the election. . Good men have talked them-
: selves out of positions of honor among the students, because they have
been unable to understand the folly of egoism. , ,
When,more class elections are tempered, with the spirit of humor
and friendly rivalry which characterized the recent election of a secre-
tary to the junior class, politics will have become more in'harmony with
the spirit of Notre Dame. In this instance the end was achieved with-
out resorting to methods'which leave a lasting bitter feeling. True, at
one stage, a strain of petty jealousy was injected against the; will'.of.
either nominee by some person or persons probably suffering from an
inferiority complex; nevertheless, this did not affect the good spirit of
the election. z	.
Since we must have politics/at Notre Dame let them be straightfor-
- ward, clean, characterized by common. sense, sober judgment, and an
appraisal of the good points of the candidates, not from, false propa-
ganda which is an inevitable accompaniment of class elections, but from
-what we see and know to be the truth. Let the spirit of fair.play pre-
dominate, Inject a sense of humor. This combination will insure har-
mony before and during elections, and secure subsequent cooperation
which is essential to a maximum of success in class activities.
The Editor Says
£
. The Boosters .are ' representative
' . Notre ’Dame men. They not only
have ideals and hopes of university
progress,. but they assist it. Their.
. work-at Homecoming, for the, 1923
Dome, /and for the NOTRE' DAME
*• DAILY, evidences the spirit of this
. group of representative meh, .men
-who are -willing to back, up their
words by acts.
' THE DAILY owes a. vote of sin-
cere thanks to the South Bend
- . News-Times. Their assistance to
this, baby publication has been very
valuable. Business and' editorial
advice and assistance have aided
much. ’

Through the
Looking Glass
Loudei* and louder grew the men-
acing drone" of the huge circular
saw. Nearer and nearer came the
wretched bundle of rags that was
strapped to' the automatic feed
plank. The bundle moved, made a
final effort to wrench free of the
binding thongs that held it, and
then relaxed, nerve-racked, utterly
exhausted/
It was Hooda Thotut. Hooda
Gestit, his uncle, who was a cruel
and wicked man, was doing away
with Hooda so that he might be sole
beneficiary of a legacy for a prune
farm left to Hooda. He had invei-
gled Hooda down to the old sawmill
with a cruet of vinegar. The mad-
dening 'liquid had fired the poor
boy’s brain.. It has caused him to
make sour remarks to his uncle, and
his uncle, who had been awaiting
just such an excuse, quickly bound
him to the feed plank and started
the works. The works was an did
mule that had always furnished the
feed power.
And yet nearer drew the body of
the ill-fated Hooda. ■ Now he was
but a foot from the vicious saw.
Now, an inch. -Now but half an
inch. And now ’a quarter of . an
inch! ’ Nothing, nothing was of. avail
now—and then, just a hair’s breadth
from the jagged blade, a. neighbor-
ing factory whistle, blew the noon
hour. The works stopped. You
couldn’t fool the: old mule. He knew
when knock-off time was.
, Thus was। Hooda saved.

Sorin.
Men from engineering and' sci-
ence have organized baseball teams
and arranged a schedule for the
remainder of the school year. The
members of the faculty, as well as
the students, have shown interest
■ and to date three games have been
played, two of which were tied.'
Because of late organization the
Civils and Electricals were not in-
cluded in the original schedule; but
7 both have good teams now and are
anxious to schedule games with oth-
er members of the league.
The season was opened officially
on May 2 when President Smith
pitched the first ball in a game be-
tween the Ground Hogs (Miners)
and the Test Tubes (Chemical En-
gineers) . It was a rip-snorting con-
test made, particularly exciting be-
cause of Horan’s artful dodging of
pop bottles. The Ground Hogs led
8-4 until the last of the ninth, when
the Test Tubes got hot and scored
four runs. The game was called
for supper with the score standing
• 8-8. A few days, later the Drug-
gists overcame a big lead and took
the measure of the Pre-Meds to the
. tune of 11-9. Hereafter batting
orders will be given and the stand-
/ ing of. clubs will appear daily.
Another tie resulted when the
Doctors met the. Ground Hogs on
last Tuesday. Good pitching and
fielding: held the game 2-2 in . the
eighth, when it was called on ac-
- count of rain. The number of tied
.games played suggests the even
matching of the clubs and the rea-
son for the .exciting interest in the
. Ordinarily you are fairly safe in
discounting by about 50 per cent
what the advance agent says con-
cerning a motion picture, but, for-
tunately, there are exceptions to
the rule. “Hunting Big Game in
Africa,” the current attraction at
the Blackstone, is a picture which
fulfills all expectations, and which is
well worth seeing. It is the result
of a two years’ expedition headed
by H. A. Snow and Sid Snow, in the
course of which they collected a re-
markable number of specimens of
African wild life as well as a pic-
torial record which is perhaps as
good as any that has been done.
Both the photographs of the action
and of the scenic episodes are above
the average, especially when you
consider the adverse conditions un-
der which the camera man worked.
It could be called an educational
picture, but to call it so implies that
it is tiresome arid uninteresting. It
is anything but that, and if you like
real adventure and real thrills, the
Blackstone is a fairly good place
to. spend an afternoon.
