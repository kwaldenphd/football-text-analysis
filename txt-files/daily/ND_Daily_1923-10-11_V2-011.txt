HOODA.
(The Play went on.)
For no reason at all the villain
was singing. The people clapped,
the orchestra started up. The vil-
lain with a broad grin, that is a
grin of such breadth and expanse
that the most conservative, not to
mention sensational, would say,
“The man is grinning,” or “What
a lovely grin,” (anyway a grin) he
started singing.
A rigid and steely concentration
hushed the house. Every eye was
fastened on him. Hooda sat his
gum tighter. It was a large mo-
ment. The American public was
getting its jazz. So -low has the-
American public fallen that it act-
ually likes to hear tunes that it
can understand. They crave jazz
music. They can’t live without it.
If you make a sound, even a little
one while the American public is
getting its jazz music it kicks you,
bites you, or worse still, it will per-
haps invite you to its house and
sing for you..
But Hooda did not know all this.
He hardly knew half of - it. He
showed his guilelessness right there
by asking a passing usher. with
earnest politeness to bring him a
glass of ice water. The rude
usher winked, and totally misunder-
standing Hooda he said, “Me too.
Last night. Some party.”
The villain was singing a song
called “Don’t Think You’ll Be
Missed,” by Hardy Fist. It went
like this: "
Got an Aunt in Minneapolis,
Got an Uncle in St. Paul,
And when they fight
They hire a hall.
Auntie’s sore for the Bible gives
. Three pages to St. Paul ;
While it doesn’t even mention
Minneapolis at all.
Oh, I got those sawed-off, ham-t
/ mered-down, dog-eared
Blue'Vitriol blues . 77. Some squall;
“Whee-ee,” howled Hooda. The
man next to him dished him a smut-
ty look, and he kept still. The vil-
lain was singing again, a sad song
this time. The audience sat with
their faces frozen with apprecia-
tion. The song was:
Honey, ya lef me flat,I
Gave me the door and slammed my
hat. ■
When I think of the good old times
When ya kept me clear of crimes,
And also of my dimes, - z
I get wild.
Honey, whyja'leeme?
Y’oughta know ’ud greeme.
When I think of all the pluggin’
That I did to get your huggin’
And not to mention muggin’, •
Honey, I rave; honey, ! rave. ....
He bowed. There were no ap-
plause this time. The women were
holding their. handkerchiefs and
weeping. The men were holding
their pocketbooks arid had a far
away look in their eyes. They filed
out of the theatre as the curtain
came down. It was like a funeral
procession, but more sad for there
were no benefactors. Hooda left,
forgetting his hat, shoes, and phone
number: . . . .
■ * •* * ■ - . "
The Off Stage. has casually sug-
gested. that^Hooda has been in the
theatre for .a -week now. Out of
compasion he has. condescended to
meet-THooda with a cab and take
him to a restaurant at once. Per-
force we are led to believe that
there is an ulterior motive. 7 Ques-
tions like, “How’d you get by with
the absences,” will, very likely creep
into the conversation. .
* * *
I’d like to wine and dine tonight
Some dainty little sinner ;
To hear the tiny tinkle of,	”
A goblet with ice
In something nice,
Held by a soft, cool little hand..
To ’ dance beneath old moon dust
. lights;
To hum a love tune in her ear
Read two sweet lies -
In two brown eyes,
And—what’s the use?. . Fm in
Freshman hall. -

THE SALVI CONCERT
The .harp concert of Signor Alberto Salvi in Washington hall Mon-
day evening was a performance which brings to mind the tremendous
success scored by Galli Curci when she sang to the Notre Dame men in
the gym some years ago. Signor Salvi’s audience was enthusiastic,
as their appreciative applause indicated.
. Notre Dame men appreciate good entertainment. . They are not
uninterested in-the finer things, as has been charged. It is true that
the entertainments in Washington hall have been “passed up” by, many
students in favor of a South Bend movie, or a date, but the evidence
seems to point to the fact that this seeming defection is due to'.thp
“small time” character of the entertainment afforded. When a really
good program is offered, there is no lack of attendance and no lack
of appreciation.
“MEAT” IN THE MEETING
An editorial in The Daily a short time ago commented that Notre
Dame has more activities "than the whole republic of Nicaragua. That
statement may have been supplemented by saying that Notre Dame
students, in their quest of activities, have developed an extraordinary
faculty to hold more meetings than the bolshevistic, agitators of the
soviet government, or our allied nations in their controversy over the
- —league covenant.- ~	‘	~	-y ;
A day never passes at Notre Dame on which tl;ere is not at least
one or two, or more meetings of some sort. And in many instances
these meetings are - scheduled at the same time during the noon hour,
or at. any other period when classes are not likely to be held. These
meetings (with some exceptions) seldom are attended by a representa-
tive group, and consequently little or nothing is accomplished at them.
The. small attendance is very often due to conflicts with other meet-
ings,'but usually the men who belong to these organizations fail to
make their appearance because they .realize that too much time is con-
sumed in trivial discussions, when they could be using their spare-mo-
ments to a better advantage. They understood the folly of wasting
an hour or two each day in some conference listening'to difficulties
which easily could have been settled in an executive gathering before a
. . general meeting was called.
• It is riot denied that meetings are essential factors to the success
of al! properly organized institutions. The . very structure of our own
democratic government depends upon the decisions reached by our rep-
resentatives and senators in the house and senate. But when purpose-
less clubs exist and . hold purposeless sessions at Notre Dame, such a
. group as the S. A. C. is justified in its efforts to curb the purposeless-
ness of it all by “clubbing the clubs.”
FORTUNATE MEN
.The class of 1927 is fortunate. Books are not flung'before them
" with:the.mere injunction: “Become educated.” They need not start
their college years with a hazy idea of what they are doing, knowing
little of what is relevant to the desired end, and knowing little of how
to advance to that end.	.	-	-	-
/ Their way is mapped out. They are shown how to progress
through their four years, and they are given, from the start, the atmos-
phere that will make them like their journey and make them seek the
ultimate in all they-meet, learning all well and. efficiently.
The freshmen lectures and the Freshman Handbook indicates the
. direction of the travel; they supply this atmosphere. The first.group
riieeting.has been held, and Father O’Donnell, James Swift and Don
Gallagher have set the stage. They have suggested what a Notre Dame
■ man is, and they have reminded the men that they are'Notre Dame
men^ and as such;-will,make the journey through four years, of college.
The first educational lecture was heard yesterday. It was general,
preparatory,; much like .the second one to be delivered by Father Walsh
on “The Traditions of Notre Dame.” 'After that theAlectures will be-
come more definite. They will be detailed sign-posts to aid the fresh-
men on their journey. <	,

At one time and another during
the past, productions of the type of
“Tell Me Why” have been attempt-
ed, and they were generally unsuc-
cessful. Because of the spirit of
the producers they have often de-
generated into a mere commercial-
ization of a very delicate theme.
Fortunately, “Tell Me Why” es-
capes most of the defects which
have marred previous plays of the
same kind. It is by no means sen-
sational, but is an object lesson
which comes highly recommended
by the Illinois Hygiene League
which has been engaged in this ।
work for a number .of years.
At the South Bend premiere last I
Sunday, James H. Brennan, secre-
tary of the Illinois Hygeine league,
appeared at the Oliver to lecture
upon the picture and to explain the
purpose for which it was placed
before the public in terms which
left no doubt in the minds of the
audience as to the philanthropy of
the venture.

—a change to a more individual
journalism.
The DAILY, you know, must be
as up-to-date as its contemps, and,
accordingly, today if space per-
mits, it begins a column of campus
comment. Many have urged such
a column, but whether it is really
wanted is still a question. We
would like to know if you want such
a column; write and tell us whether
or no.
The success of such a column de-
pends not only on what is talked
about, but how this talking is done.

The writers must be good judges of
human nature; they must be able to
say things so that they cannot be
understood in an unexpected way
that hurts, or causes the wrong im-
pression.
The first several installments of
the DAILY column will be feelers,
and we hope to improve them. They
will feel the way, and if they re-
ceive commendation, they will be
continued. In time they may ap-
proach the excellence „of the one

Rockne Takes 33 Men East; Army
Points to Break String of
Losses With N. D.
“We are up against a tough prop-
osition but the boys will give all
they have got,” said Rockne, as the
team prepared to leave for the
East, yesterday.^
That is the whole situation
summed up in a* few words and
there will be no alibis. -
The Army team, reinformed by
several new men, including “Tiny”
Hewitt, will endeavor to the extent
of their ability, to avenge the long
string of defeats that they have
suffered at the hands of the Fight-
ing Irish. Two defeats and one tie
out, of ten encounters are the only
reverses the Rockmen have brought
home with them from the Plains of
West Point. • '	/
Weight will not count so much
in Saturday’s . battle, in so far as
it is all on the side of the cadets,
but it will be a battle of brains'
against, brains and brawn. ••
The team went through a light
workout yesterday and a short
dummy scrimmage wound up their
last appearance on . the home
grounds, before leaving to meet
West Point. .
The following men will leave
with. Coach- Rockne and Manager
