Well, here I am again—such as

I had an awful dream last night.
‘	-o- -o-	'
You know Curry? Bob Curry?
Bob Curry of Walsh hall? '
.	-o- -o-
Well, in this dream Bob was fight-
ing a 'duel.. It wasn’t a duel prop-
»rly so-called, because Bob didn’t
have a sword. He was using a
knife, brandishing it/ and pirouet-
ting ’ about awfully bloodthirstily,
[t was terrible. - Just as Bob made
a horrible lunge at his antagonist—
I didn’t- recognize him, so I will
call him'Smith—just as the bell
rang for my 10 o’clock class, Bob
lunged at Smith.	■	.

,You can never tell where a man
is from by the way he talks. Yes-
terday.! heard Ed Ryan, he of the
Windsor tie and the white: sweater,
cry,' “Clevah!” Ha! I thought, ■ a
true southern gentleman, or an
Englishman, although'what an Eng-
lishman is doing with that name, I
don’t know. -	'	■'.
"	-o- -o-
Pressing the button on my desk,
I summoned Scout G7wq and asked
him to look up Ed’s antecedents.
He must have‘ had a hard'time be-
cause he didn’t come back- for an
hour. “He’s from Savannah,” an-
nounced the scout. “Tknew.it,”; I
said,. “Ydu can’t fool old; Ebenezer-
Grundy. No Siree.” Savannah, Il-
linois,” said the scout and I threw
Roget’s Thesaurus at *him. ;
Andy Sleigh is overjoyed. He has
attained (or should it be obtained?
And me in college, too) access to
the inaccesible..and has been tread-
ing on air ever since. Rumor has it
that Andy intends to stand beneath
a window in Sorin on the next warm
night and give a , serenade. . : \

no information concerning .the ex-

JUNIOR CLASS STAG
SUPPER TONIGHT
Elaborate Program Arranged; Af-
fair to be a “Get-together” for
Entire Junior Class.
. The Junior Stag Banquet will be
held tonight at 7 o’clock, in the
College Inn of LaSalle Hotel. The
committee in charge, Anthony
Krider, Eddie Luther, Jerry Miller,
“Rip” Miller, Phil Mohney, has
secured the following. entertain-
ment: Dumke and Butterworth
(accompanied by Davis on the
piano); songs by Eddie Luther and
Bill Furey; and music by the Big
Five. Dori Gallagher, president of
the Senior class, has. also been se-
cured as one of the speakers of the
evening. -.
The.object of the “stag,” as many
think, is not to raise money; it is
purely a “get-together” and “get-
acquainted” party to promote a
better Leeling of fellowship among
the . Junior classmen. It will also
combine a business meeting, with
the pleasures of the evening. Class
discussions will be in order and
plans for the future outlined. ;
It is often rather, difficult for
some of the juniors to get together
at the noon hour when . meetings
are regularly scheduled, and so the
class officers thought such a “stag”
party would be an occasion to as-
semble riiore of the men. -
The affair promises to be the out-
standing -feature of class activities
for the pre-Christmas season, and
it is hoped that every junior will be
there. - •	. .. '•'
There , are still a. few tickets left.
These may be secured at 424 Badin
hall. .. .	...
Cleveland Club to
Give Formal Dance
. The graduate and undergraduate
members of the Cleveland Notre
Dame .club are planning on giving
two' dances during, the Christinas
holidays. . One is to be a formal
dinner, held at the University club,
on the evening of January 2. This
party is exclusively for the Cleve-
land-Notre Dame men and a few of
their friends who are included
among the eighty- invitations that
are being mailed.	.
The other dance is to be informal,
and it marks the first of their semi-
annual inforirials that are to be
held in the Wade Park Manor,
-Notre Dame studerits who happen
to be in Cleveland at the time are
invited to .the affair. The tickets,
which sell for three dollars, can .be
purchased from either Charles
Mooney of Sophomore hall, or Elroy
Habert of Badin. '
Wm. A. Pinkerton,
Old N. DiMan is Dead
' • William A? Pinkerton, head of
the 'world-famed Pinkerton Detec-
tive . Agency, and former Notre
Dame student, died Tuesday morn-
ing in Los Angeles after an illness
of-two years. .
He was the son of the founder,
of the United States Secret Service,
Allan Pinkerton. He was born at
Dundee, Illinois, April 7, 1846.
After being educated at both pub-
lie and private schools, he entered
the University of Notre. Dame. At
the outbreak-of the Civil War he
became connected , with the secret
service • division and in 1865 was
taken into his father’s office. He
succeeded to;the’ head of the busi-
ness upon the death of Allan Pink-
erton in 1884. '	..	■ , .
.Internationally known to. crim-
inals as “The. Eye,’’ he was much
beloved, by his friends, and much
feared by those who knew him only
as a relentless foe,. He was also
famed , as a “first-nighter” and lov-
er of stories.. . .	.
.. He entered Notre Dame as a
minim about the year 1858 but left
before finishing to take up his duties
in, the Civil War.	. •

Glee Club Gives '
Initial Concert
The Notre Dame ' Glee club, ap-
peared in its first concert last night
in the . auditorium. of the Misha-
waka high ^school before an audi-
ence estimated-at 500. The concert
was under the auspices of the Jun-
ior class of Mishawaka high school.
“Drink to Me Only With Thine
Eyes,” sung by George Koch and
Vernon Rickard, assisted' by the
Glee club, was especially well .re-
ceived.
Miss Josephine Decker and Mrs.
Mayone Galloway assisted the Glee
club in . the 5recital. Miss Decker
sang three contralto solos. Mrs.
Galloway played three difficult se-
lections on the piano. ...	.
Two of the club’s numbers which
were particularly appreciated by the
audience were, “Old King Cole,” by
Forsythe, and “Funiculi-Funicula,”
by Denza-Hilton.	. .
DEAN KONOP TALKS
TO K. OF C. ON LABOR
Catholic Booklets to be Distributed;
Large Initiation Expected;
Fund Plans Progressing. ,
Dean Konop of the Law School
spoke to the Knights of Columbus
last Tuesday evening in the council- -
chambers on “The Labor Problem :
in America today.” He told of the
strife between capital and labor,
stating that striwes and disconterit- .
ment would never be eliminated
until employers came to realize that
labor is not a mere commodity for
which they are to bargain as they
see fit. He spoke favorably of the
present tendency of employers to
provide better working conditions, ■
and he laid stress on the fact that
it was gradually making for the so- . :
cial betterment of the . working-,
man. .	.
Rev. Charles Miltner, Dean of the
College of Arts and Letters, told of .
a plan for booklets on Catholic sub-
jects, to be placed at . the disposal .
of Notre Dame students and mem- -
bers of the council. .	.
Grand Knight Barnhart informed
the council of the initiation to be
held in the second week of Janu-
ary. He stated that many appli-
cations already had been submit-
ted, and that - the number of en-
trants probably would have to be
limited. He urged all prospective .
candidates to submit applications as
soon as possible. From all indica-
tions, he said that January initia-
tion class ■will be one of the larg-
est admitted to the local council. . ’
George Bishoff, chairgan of the
building fund committee which plans *
to erect a .Kriights of Columbus
Social Center building on the cam-
pus within', the riext few years, stat- ‘
ed that the committee. was exairi-
ining plans of other community
houses with a view of embodying
the best features in the new Notre
Dame building.. A campaign for
Lunds is being planned.
Many members from other coun- .
cils attended the meeting. Several -
selections were sung by, the Knights '
of Columbus quartet, and refresh-
ments were served.	'

THE DEAL) HAND
- Something uncanny, spectral, arid altogther outside student ken
.-.seems to get’between the • Players’ club-and its activities. Not within
. . the memory of any undergraduate has this .organization elicited real
— spontaneity in its existence or alacrity:in the. pursuance of its projects.
Always its functioning has paralleled the. character of Hamlet, and
even that resemblance seems vague and indefinite.	•
7 This does not mean that the Players’ club 'has accomplished noth-
ing. Prof. Sullivan can look back" on a great many afternoons arid
evenings spent in tedious rehear sal during which) he gladly underwent the
sapping strain that every director must stand. :In return he.received the
careless felicitations "of friends.and the Obeisance of the campus—noth-
'ing.more.”,In it there was no positive encouragement; During the past
three years, sirice Prof. Sullivan’s advent;at Notre Dame,-men.have been
presented .with-the. best ;of. the Little Theatre offerings. He even
brought out local talent in producing Harold Haynes’ not-bad sketch
.; in Washington hall last year—a most memorable event.	:
With all this achievement there has pervaded the activities of the
club a. lackadaisical spirit. This vitiating influence stands at direct
variance with the sturdy enthusiasm that would be expected to prevail
■ at, say the Workshop in Cambridge. The same dead hand seems to
:. have reached- into .the :present-activities-of- the club. . The literati have
already published a book of verse; the debaters are piling up inepntro-
, vertible facts, and last but not quite foremost in the Notre Dame cosmos,
the Daily has established itself. •
Why, then, can’t the Players’ club take a draught of the cosmic
urge and bring.to light another playwright'who is a Notre Dame man?
- Let the Thespians shake off the dead hand and. resume their proper
place in the limelight. '	:
THE GLEE CLUB
-At Notre Dame -we'talk-so much about the prowess of our football
teams that we are-likely to. forget there is another organization on the
campus whose efforts to make Notre Dame nationally famous are as
strenuous, and require as much labor and preparation as any football
squad .ever turned- out by -Coach Rockne. The Glee club, without
which the University would be incomplete, is confronted by problems
. identical with those the football team faces, every year. Candidates
must be.called for, and the “weeding out” process must be every bit as
thorough, as in the selection of football material. Then weeks and
j - weeks of practice are necessary before the first concert can be at-
tempted. During these weeks the club-does not practice as a whole all
-- the time. An assistant-director takes the tenors, the baritones; and the
bassos, and. instructs them in just the same way that/the assistant-)
■ coach on the gridiron takes his backfield, his line, his ends, and shows
them their-'individual fine points and defects. Then, occasionally, the
club assembles for a rehearsal, even as Rockne sometimes gathers his
first string, men for signal practice. Certainly the baton of the di-
rector is every bit as difficult to follow as. the numbers snapped by the
-. little quarterback.	.
'The Glee club is.as essentially: a. part of, Notre Dame life as any
other organization on the campus, and it can do as much good for Notre
Dame as any of these other organizations. . Doctor J. Lewis Browne,;
: the director of the club, has unbounded confidence in its ability. Show
him that you, too, are-worthy of this confidence by boosting the Glee
club when you are at home Christmas. ' . --	'
-o- -o-	.
Maybe if he and his mattress are
piled out on the floor very often
he’ll be singing, “There’s a Long,
Long Trail.”

Here’s another one: “‘Big AI,’
the cowboy architect from Iowa,
had his hair marcelled and bought
a fedora after meeting his damsel
in the big town. But why buy a
hat after-having a marcel?”

Here’s another one that I can’t
fathom: Invitations will be mailed
out to the faculty and select mem-
bers; of the student body for the
opening of Levi Geriiesse’s theatre
unless his present plans hold out.

Mr, Grundy—this is very formal,
hence the third person—much pre-
fers the cap and bells to the mortar
board. He flatters himself , that no
matter how poor his humor may be
it is better than some. Some, for
example, which his contributors
send in. Humor which may be
characterized by the word low brow.
You remember what Billy Sunday
said about' the fellow, who had to
climb a "ladder to look a snake in
the eye.. Humor like, the "specimen
given us is a reflection on the char-)
acter, environment, and heredity of
its author, because it is impossible
to believe .that anyone could . get
like that in just one generation.
; -o- . -o- • "
• That’ll be enough of d;hat. If
your humor is. as graceful as the
pirouetting, of . an - elephant going
through the motions of the Argen-
tine tango, and if you would .be
ashamed to sign your name to it.
or would be,ashamed.to-show it to
anyone for whonr you;have irespect,.
don’t send it in. -The colurim can
get along without it. The school
could worry along without you.

Editor NOTRE DAME DAILY: ;
My attention has been called to
the December first issue of your
newspaper, containing an account
of the Thanksgiving Day football
game between the Universities of
Notre Dame and St. Louis. As a
student of the latter institution and
a staff-member of the student pub-
lications here, I wish to take this op-
portunity of expressing my sincere
appreciation of the “fair and
square” manner in which the affair
was "written up in the DAILY.
Though necessarily speaking in a
most informal and unofficial capac-
ity, I nevertheless have no hesita-
tion in assuring you that every one
of our thirty-four hundred students
are as one with me in the high re-,
gard I hold for all that is of Notre
Dame. ". • ■
If there can be anything which
has given the people of St. Louis in
general, and the students of the
university in particular, greater sat-
isfaction than the splendid show of
sportsmanship on the part of the
Notre Dame team last Thanksgiving,
it is the gentlemanly way in which
the account of the game was pre-
sented to your student body through
the columns of their own paper. It
was a little thing,.perhaps, but it
signifies' much..
And that is why we, down here in
St. Louis U., are seeking an even
closer relationship , with you of
Notre Dame. That is why it is our
heartfelt wish for many future
meetings on the . gridiron to take
place between the world-renowned
“Irish,” and our own “Billikens,”
representing the oldest university
west of the . Mississippi. . :

Just read the criticism bf J./F. S.
on the Palace. bill . of ..this week.
F. S,
Since we the undersigned have not
missed many shows at the Palace
since its opening last November
(1922), we take' this occasion to
state that in our several imagina-
tions this, bill was of better than
the average- type.
We agree, with Mr./Stoeckley that
the picture was developed from an
overworked theme, but we thought
House Peters’ acting was supierb.
To put the student body right on
this unjust criticism we take1' this
opportunity of reviewing the per-
formance from the viewpoint of un-
sophisticated theatregoers.. . \ . >
■: Alexander Brothers and Lucille
opened the bill with a ball-bouncing
INTOLERANCE
Every now and then certain manifestations of narrow-mindedness
creep out-among us. / Under the guise of democracy this spirit of in-
tolerance attacks and ridicules certain students who have the courage
-to hold to their convictions. :It is a trace of that Puritanical notion of
severity of dress which prevailed in early Massachusetts. It assails
any tendency towards new styles; it condemns.color or ornamentation;
it strives to prohibit changes in modes.	’	..
Notre Dame democracy does not mean that everyman on the
campus is bound to wear corduroys and.hobnails. Thcman who wishes
-to do so may. That is Notre Dame democracy. . And likewise the man
. who wishes to wear a yellow slicker or a bright sweater should be al-
lowed that privilege without fear of .ridicule. The democracy that we
cherish does not undertake to determine what we may-or may not wear.
It means that a student is free in regard to such matters.
/ Narrow-mindedness and democracy are two different things. We
should , not tolerate intolerance.It has no place here. It should be
uprooted. Notre Dame democracy should not be used as a shield for the
- shallow views of a few/ :	. -•	-	’	,	\

“Sergeant Tim/’ by. Mary T.

. ' Dame, Ind., $1.00.
. In - this delightful' account of
strenuous activity Mrs. Waggaman
portrays child life in all its pleas-
ure, perils, and fears, delights and
■ sacrifices. A rather involved plot
' takes the thirteen-year-old hero,
Tim Tracy, through complications
that cause the reader to wonder at
the youthful “sergeant’s” versatil-.
ity._ 'He raises his mother and him-
self from poverty to comparative
comfort; realizes his. ambition of
performing in the government ser-
vice; saves the life of a small friend;
■ and brings love and happiness to a
large number of others.
There is real inspiration for
' younger Catholic readers in this
story. Mrs. .. Waggaman has the
- happy faculty of making her theme
strongly felt, without indulging in
objectionable “preaching.” All in
all, it is an excellent volume for a
Christmas gift for that boy or. girl
-inwery early teens.; But be sure to
include a box of handkerchiefs, too,.

AT THE ORPHEUM.
We have been told that there is
a vast difference between typical
audiences of various towns. For
instance, a .prowd of mill workers
in a movie theatre in Woonsocket,
Mass., or of half-breed Mexicans in
Nogales,. Ariz., will not have the
same taste or lack of taste as a
group of horn-rimmed college
youths in Valparaiso, Ind.
Which impels us to observe that
“The Fighting Blade” is really a
solution of the problem described
above. There, is no difficulty- in de-
ciding where it will -have its great-
est appeal, for it will be just as
good in Woonsocket as in Nogales,
or even in Valparaiso.
It is another “period” play of ro-
mance, honor, and long-haired
chevaliers, which takes nothing
from the-period but the costumes
and a cardboard castle. Dick Bar-
thelmess bobs his hair and assumes
the fierce countenance of a master
of fence. -At the-expense of several
more or less amiable gentlemen, he
wades through blood with d’Ar-
tagnanesque boots until the fade-
out.. We were so engrossed ; in
watching - him--strut about without
tripping over his murderous blade
that we saw the performance twice,
hoping he would forget himself the
second time. *	- .
After listening to Oliver. Crom-
well sing a Roundhead roundelay,
and witnessing a staunch Puritan
hussar crash in the top of a hogs-
head of Flemish wine, with an ease
of execution rivaling - that of Car-
rie Nation, we can understand why
Charles II was so warmly received
when he returned from exile. - ~

Rare Stones Shown
in the Library
Several rare relics indicating the
advance of religion, and more par-
ticularly of Christianity in differ-
ent. parts of the world, have been
placed on exhibition in the library.
Besides the Mongol, Manchu and
Tibetan prayer boards, described in
a recent issue of the DAILY, many
old record stones dating back as
far as 2300 B. C. are included. The
stones, on which are engraved re-
ceipts,'temple records, letters,- mes-
sages, . tablets and what is thought
to be price-tags for merchandise,
were taken from the Jokha, Worka,
Senkereh and Drehem record stones.
The exhibit features one of the
famous “Royal Records” of King
Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. This
relic is a clay cylinder about nine
inches high, engraved with a rath-
er flattering account of the exploits
and engineering feats of the king.
Nebuchadnezzar’s time was 605-
562 B. C.
There are also relics of an early
South American Indian civilization,
showing a pronounced Egyptian im.
fluence. These include Inca hand
pottery of the Aztec Indians and
an. Azetec Murial idol; '
Several old manuscripts in Ro-
man and Gothic hand lettering are
also on exhibition. One copy is
very valuable, being one of the only
two in this country. Others with

illuminations are dated at 1425 and
1430, or 25 years, before the in-
vention of printing.
Perhaps the most interesting
part of the collection is a copy of
the text of the “monument of great
propagation of the Luminous Doc-
trine in Central Chinese Empire.”
The .transcripts were presented
to the Library by George- Chao,
Journalism II, and were found in the
sixteenth century in Si-Ngau-Fau
province of China, by a Jesuit priest.
The Copy was given to Chao, he
says, by a Lazarist missionary.
“The original inscription,” said
Chao yesterday, “is actually pre-
served in China. Therefore,, it is
very precious ' and valuable to
Chinese Catholics and the foreign
missionaries in China. The inscrip-
tion is in perfect condition alnd
without any damage. Any students
in the University may get the trans-
lation in the book, ‘The History of
Christianity in China, Tibet and
India,’ by l’Abbe Hac.
“In this inscription/’ he contin-
ued, “there are some signatures of
priests. It proves the early exis-
tence of Christianity in China,
is probable that Saint Thomas,
apostle, preaching in China.”
DON’T WAIL ABOUT IT
(Continued from Page 2.)
gan I heard a man say, “Who’s that
bird?” His companion answered,
“Oh, that? That’s a Notre Dame
guy. Can’t you tell/em by their ,
looks, hatless, either badly touseled
hair or well axle-greased, open1
shirt, and names inked all over his
shirt?”
Well, the “bird” in question was
a Notre Dame “guy,” but he was
also a verdant freshman. The.
streets were full of properly attired -
upper-classmen, yet this freshman
stood out as representative of Notre
Dame men with his ultra-Bohemian
affectation. Because freshmen are
not (yet) required to sport the ver-
dant headgeai’ is no reason for not
wearing any.
On the campus we revel in our
unconventional attire, and rightly
so, but when we are among strang-
ers who are too easily wont to be- '
come hostile critics, let’s be careful
about the impression we make. Our
appearance is our‘ad.’ If freshmen -
aren’t good ‘ads’ don’t-give them a
full page spread on the front street.'
Keep them amoung friends until
they learn better.

INTERHALL CAGE
CARD ANNOUNCED
FOOTBALL SQUAD
. (Continued from Page 1.)
livered in his characteristic style,
of the games during the season just
closed and the prospects for the
.	1924 season.	.
’ - After speaking of the essentials
and the value of true college sports-
manship, the noted coach eulogized
the team and the calibre of the men
who wore the colors of Notre Dame
. and pointed out that brain and cour-
• age, not brawn, were the character-
istics of modern football. He called
particular attention to the work cf
, the men'in action on the field other
than the man who was carrying
the ball, revealing the fact that the
majority of the . time the work • f
the linemen and the intecf?rence
is rarely appreciated to the extent
of which it is worthy. .
As to the Nebraska game, Rockne
made brief of the subject, by say-,
irig, “We have no alibis to offer.”
Rockne noted particularly the fact
- that the defeat by the Cornhuskers
-	- was the supreme test of the year,
as to whether the Irish football
players'.were quitters or not, .and
that when the pall of defeat en-
shrouded them that the Fighting
Irish came back in elegant fashion
- and. decisively won the three re-
' maining games of the schedule,
. which proved that the Notre Dame
football men are not quitters and
that defeat is merely an incentive
to defend more valiantly their
glorious traditions.	.
.. .. Coach Rockne in closing pro-
- ~ nounced the season a satisfactory
one in all respects and that the
thing that would always be. remem-
bered in the lives of the men of
this’ year’s' team was the wonder-
• ful. treatment accorded to them at
their opponents’ camps,’ in particu-
lar, West Point and Princeton.
In mentioning the schedule for
next year,. Rockne characterized it
as being another heavy, card and
. as io the prospects of the team next
- year,- considering that ten reliable
... veterans would be lost by gradua-
.’ion, he could make no prophesies.
When the' deafening, applatise had
subsided, Rockne announced the
' names of the men to whom the Ath-
letic Board had awarded morio-
grams fortheir meritorious work on
the playing field. The.list follows:
' ' Collins, .. Crowe, Mayl, Murphy,
_ - Hunsinger, Noppenberger, Bach,
- Edgar Miller, ‘ Oberst, Brown, Wei-
bel, Vergara, Kizer, Reagan, Walsh,
Reese, Stuhldreher, Crowley, Don
-.	Miller, Bergman, Connell, Maher,
.	Houser, Cerney, Enright and Lay-
u den. - ' „ '
■ Harvey Brown-made a few re-
; . marks in. which he thanked'.the busi-
• ness men for their kindness. Mayor
- Seebirt, followed with a few re-
- marks .of praise for the. work of the
team during the past year and
.	. Clarence Overend, of Carnegie
Tech, directed his remarks to show-
- . ing how the personality of the coach
~ was apparent in the team, arid that
the Notre Dame team was the finest,
. smoothest working organization he
. ■ had. ever seen...	/
The banquet prograrii was varied
by clever vaudeville, composed of
- singing and monologue acts. ...

Pool Tournament
Nears the Finals
Frank O’Brien, Carroll hall, won
the Carroll “rec” pool tournament
last night by defeating Balfe Wag-
ner, of Walsh, in a. closely contested
match, and is now in a position to
meet the winner of the Brownson
section for the championship of the
University.
The contest last night was full
of thrills from the very beginning,
to the hair-raising, finish, when
O’Brien made a run of 18, nosing
out Wagner by two points. Wag-
ner took the lead, which he held
until near the close of the first half
when O’Brien pushed ahead and
finished his first string ten points
up on Wagner. His lead, however,
was overcome when Wagner made a
long run which he kept until a few
minutes before the finish of the
game. With the score 98 to 82 in
Wagner’s favor, O’Brien started his
victorious run and finished 100
to 98/	. .
It was by far the best attended
exhibition of the tournament. Both
men displayed much skill in. per-
forming some difficult shots.
The pool and billiard tournament
will be decided in the Brownson
division later in the. week, and then
the finals will be played to deter-
mine the .champion of the 'Univer-
sity.	-

THE RUBDOWN
In looking over the record books
we find that the Notre Dame foot-
ball team is the possessor of one of
the most phenomenal records of col-
lege football for the past five years.
Within that time, the Fighting Irish
have engaged in 48 games, of which
44 were victories, three losses, and
one a tie. During those five sea-
sons the Irish moleskin warriors
amassed a total of 1,352 points,
which gives an average score per
game of 28 to 4.
This year Notre Dame played a
ten-game card, lost one and was
victorious in the other nine, piling
up a point total of 275. The rec-
ord is big enough to speak for it-
self.	:------
Some of the old timers tell a
story about Coach Rockne that goes
something like this: Before Rockne
began coaching at Notre Dame, he
coached a team in South Bend
every afternoon and, on Sundays
refereed the game in which his team
played.	.
Notre Dame Cagemen
Meet Armour Saturday
The Notre Dame cagemen will
play the Armour Tech quintet of
Chicago Saturday^ It has not yet
been decided whether the game will
be played Saturday afternoon in the
gymnasium, or Saturday evening at
the Y. M. C. A.	.
This game will afford the student
body their first opportunity to see
the Notre Dame five.in action after
their even break with the “Goph-
ers.” ;	...
It will also give those trying out
for the team a chance to show their
“wares,” as Armour Tech is not con-
ceded to be so strong as Minnesota,.

A short time ago we were the
recipient of some reminiscences
that form part of the glories of
Notre Dame, concerning the Irish
basketball team in tlie days of Pete
Vaughan. The Irish cagemen
started out on a lengthy trip one
year that took them East, and down
the Atlantic seaboard, and around
the Gulf. As a part of the trip
certain press agent reports reached ■■
the ears of a basketball team in
Buffalo that was scheduled to meet ,
the . Notre Dame quintet, concern-
ing the scrappy qualities that were
inherent in the Fighting Irish. The
Buffalo men also possessed a sim-
ilar reputation, and on the night of ,
the game the playing began to take
on the semblance of more than the .
usual pep. The referee finally hit	;
upon the happy idea that the only	’
way to preserve himself from injury
was to toss~ up the ball, blow the	'
whistle, and' run out of the cage,	:
leaving the two teams to fight it out	1
in their own barbarous way.	!
