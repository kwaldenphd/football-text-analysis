I have begun to skat.e. My les-
sons have not arrived at the point
where I make use of the skates, but
I am confident that, with enough
cold weather, I shall find the skates
very useful. By careful selection of
' the spots on the lake where the co-
[ horts of Brother Hugh have not
I Jet cleared Jhe congealed waters, I
have been able to relieve them of
much, work, as on each successive
two or three strokes I find that I
can remove,' by, means of my ex-
pansive back, much of the hinder-:

of the glassy pond.	■

: j am obliged to clack at my Un-
derwood’ today from a standing po-
sition. Even that is good, how-
ever, for there is less wear on our
chairs. Some day I may find this
feat of writing while standing up
(Newman wrote that way all the
time) valuable. .	.

-1 have fortunately a letter here
that is of much assistance'to me in
the present limited stage of my
training. It is written on green
' stationery by a' chap whose first
name - begins with “E” and who
lives in Brownson. The letter, a
' copy of which lies before me, was
. brought to * me by ' special scout
K9ER.' It follows:

“Dear Miss:.	\

thought that I' would drop you a
few lines. I am a student at Notre
/.Dame ^University - and- at times',I.
‘' geFrather lonesome so if’ you would:
contribute 'to the cause why I
should be very happy.
• “It may seem to you that I am
rather .bold but I hope that you may
overlook-this and send a few words
of solace. I guess, you heard of
Notre Dame a good deal'and I heard
a good deal about Chicago and that
cify is -all jthe more interesting
since you live in it. ’
(	'“I am very anxious to hear from
you and am more anxious to get ac-
quainted with you. We have a won-
derful football team up here. I
do not know if this kind of sport
appeals to you” or not but I do not
know what to write any more so I
( want to send a full paper and I
! know that I can scribble a good
deal on this subject.
“I want to tell you of a fellow
that sleeps in my dormitory that
lives - in Chicago. One night
last week I happened to..' awake
‘ about one o’clock A. M. and just as
! I awoke I heard this fellow from
I Chi say, ‘Don’t shoot me; I’ll marry
the girl.’ I do not know who the
fellow had reference to but I hope
it wasn’t you anyway. •

UP here but I will tell you that they
lack one fundamental. thing that is

education and I guess you know
.without my telling. Well, in case

in the way to tell you. I mean that
.no.school or any other, walk of life
complete-without'girls. That is
my^way of looking at the matter

on^that one point. . .	(	’

WIN SONG CONTEST
“Lonely,” by Engels and LaBedz
Is Awarded First Place at
Blackstone Theatre. ,
“Lonely,” the song which was
selected by. popular choice as the
winner in The South Bend Tribune,
song- -writing contest,. is the work
of Norbert A.' Engels ■ and Victor
W. LaBedz, both of whom are stu-
dents at the University., .
' The announcement of the win-
ners on Friday night at the Black-
stone came after the number of
entries had narrowed to two:
“Maravan,” an oriental selection,
and . the winning number. Follow-
ing tests in which the rounds of
applause given for each song ap-
peared, to’ receive an equal volumn-
ous response, L. Wolfe Gilbert, pop-
ular song composer and Al Ham-
mond of. the AL Hammon’s Great
White Way orchestra, judge and
associate judge, respectively, both
were apparently non-plussed. The
winners, were decided only when a
final outburst of handclapping at
the mention of the name “Lonely”
decided the contest.
The popularity of the winning se-

Cue Champions to.
Be Decided Today
Final matches to determine the
pool and billiard champions of the
University will be. played this morn-
ning immediately after the 8:30
mass. The pool tilt will be held in
Brownson “rec” room, and at the
same time the billiard championship
will be decided in the Carroll sec-
tion. The games will be run off
in 100 point blocks._	.
' In the pool division Murray of
Brownson will meet O’Brien of Car-
roll. Murray earned the right to
contest the finals by defeating An-
drews Friday night. O’Brien, won
out in the Carroll division by the
narrowest of margins. A long run
at the end of the game gave him a
two-point win over Wagner.
In the title match of the billiard
tourney, Kauffman, a day man rep-
resenting Carroll, will meet Hall,
the Brownson champ. The former’s
brilliant showing gives him the edge
over his opponent. His victories
have been clean-cut and impressive.
It will be a first-class match.
The checker tournament has been
called off for the present because of
lack of entries. Although the game
is popular in both recreation rooms,
the title of “checker champ” is not
so eagerly sought for- as it once
was.	' '	• .

I Change in Daily Distribution j
1 Beginning with Tuesday’s issue of the DAILY, a new at- 1
1	tempt will be made to solve the problem of' distribution to those	|
I	day students residing on the west side of the St. Joseph River.	j
|	With the scholastic year almost half over, service to these sub-	j
j	scribers is still decidedly unsatisfactory, but it is, sincerely hoped	!
?	by the management of the DAILY that our latest efforts will be	1
:	successful. Five months’ experience has shown us that there is	I
i	no practicable, reliable method of guaranteeing delivery-to-the-	]
I	door to the widely separated students residing in this particular	j
|	section of South Bend. The only alternative is to find a central	?
J	location of general advantage at which all subscribers in the west	!
j	portion of the city will be certain of getting their DAILY early	1
s	on every day-of publication. It is believed that such a location	I.
1	has been found, and the present plan of distribution consists of	j
1 the following features:	.	.	j
I	1.	The change applies only to students not residing east of	j
j of the river.	i
।	2.	A small card, similar to the athletic cards, will be issued	«

LOYOLA BEATEN BY
CLOSE SCORE, 24-23
Chicago Invaders Put Up Strong '
Fight; Notre Dame to Meet
Franklin Saturday. .
By a margin of a free throw, in
the last few minutes of play, the
Notre-Dame basketball five man-
aged to defeat the University of
Loyola’s fast quintet of eagers, 24-
23, on the “Y” floor last night.	'
The Irish cagemen got a closer
call than was expected, and were
forced to desperate playing in the
closing minutes of the game as the
spectacular court performers from
the Windy City kept neck and neck
with 'the Maylmen .by long floor
shots.	z .
In the first period the playing
progressed slowly and both teams
missed a great many shots. The
visitors were sifting through the , -
Irish defense and by the us6 of
clever passing tactics and an' oc-
casional long shot; were beginning
to find the Notre Dame basket.
■ Half /Ends at 10-10 f
In this period the visitors dis-
played remarkable ability to block
the attempts - of the Irish forward
and several times when Crowe and .
Kizer were within easy scoring dis-
talnce, the Loyola eagers fought
with ‘desperation to ward ' off the
shot. Combining their close guard- ■
ing -with the ability to handle the
ball with great speed, they tied
Notre Dame at the half, 10-10.
The second frame started with ,
the Irish eagers opening up a steady
drive for the visitors net, and after
each team had dropped a basket,
the Loyola squad took the lead -with
-free’'-throw. "Enrighty"^	r
come into the game just before the
end of the first half, played a great ‘
passing, game and twice narrowly
missed the loop on long shots. .
Keogan injected Crowe and Ma-
honey into the game and the action
increased as Crowe scored on a
beautiful shot from the side. Loy- .
ola was rushing the Notre Dame;
basket again, but the close guard-
ing of. Phil Mahoney prevented the
visitors from scoring on two at-
tempts. With Loyola one point in -
the lead, Riordan scored from the ”
side and tied up'the count at 15-15.
• Loyola Captain Is Star. .
. With but five minutes left to
play, the game increased in speed
and Loyola began to sink phenom- -
enal shots as fast as the Fighting _
Irish scored to regain the lead.
Crowe rung up two more baskets
in a riot of action and the visitors,
fighting to top the scant lead, made
another pair of pretty shots that
left Notre Dame with a one-point
margin as the game ended.	.

Crusaders to Present
Boxing Program Soon
Plans for an interesting boxing
program to be given in the early
part of February, are being’ made

“Nature,” says Emerson, “seems
to exist for the excellent.” Possi-
bly this is because many become
excellent by patronizing her, and
that she is partial to her votaries.
It is said that Nature makes poets.
It must be so. Otherwise where
would they get the analogies which
make their poetry1 not only possi-
ble but palatable? Take away the
stimulus of storm and sunshine, of
sea and mountain, of the flowers
and the. rain, of the stars and the
clouds, and the poets would be in
a sad way indeed. The world would
suffer a loss of excellence,
the poets are excellent men. .

NOTRE DAME RENAISSANCE
The publication of the “Hike Song” and “Lonely,” written by
Notre Dame undergraduates, is significant as marking a-deyelopment
. of Notre Dame student life. Someone has said that youth is a time
for.dreams and it seems that at Notre Dame there is a decided impulse
to make these dreams come true. Several new publications are appear-
ing on the. campus; the chemists and the "engineers have never before
~ been-so active; there is a tendency,to branch out into new fields and
attempt newer and greater things. .Is this the Renaissance of Notre
- Dame? Has Notre Dame’s student body progressed until today it is
passing into an era of development which will be -later known as the
rebirth of Notre Dame?
.Briefly summing up the development of" the past year, it is dis-
covered that in the publication field, four new periodicals were’founded,
several songs which seem destined to become popular, or—what is
perhaps better—-have been acknowledged as good were composed, a
book of verse which attracted favorable comment from all parts of the
United States was compiled and published. . Athletics at Notre Dame
have always held a high standard, but the past few years have brought
to the little-brick gym the eyes of the -world and to the little athletic
office in the Main building the praise and emulation of the country’s
mightiest athletic authorities. Oratory has found its Renaissance in
the triumph of Notre Dame in national contests. In the field of drama,
' plays diave been- written. and staged by undergraduates and’the im-
- petus -which- at’-preseht-is-driving-the Drama club-’seems to indicate
huge strides in future dramatic work at Notre Dame.	r
And now to the point which this editorial purposes to make. You
who have dreams, make of them creations;. you engineers who hold a
secret ambition to perfect, some little invention you have, discovered,
begin work now to: make it a reality; you writers, strive to produce
something which will be truly worthwhile, some .work of artistic
writing which will endure. All you who dream and have plans and
•ambitions, strive now-for the thrill of creation, .Whether your special-
ty is writing, drawing, organizing, composing, or a perfect end run,
make of it a work of art, a work of creation. . The. impulse to make
dreams' come true seems to be a distinctive mark of the progressive
Notre Dame- student of the present. You are present but are you
progressive?	.	>	' .
things away, one might ask why
there are not more poets? Why in-
deed are we not all poets? Has
Nature some trick of Jhiding her
beauties from all but a few favored
sons? -Do we not all see the things
the poets see and write about?
Why may we also not write about
them and thus share their honors?
o—
One question seems but to raise
another. Well, we do not think
the blame can be laid upon Nature.
She treats all alike. The stars do
not hide their faces nor the birds
cease their song when we ordinary
mortals sally forth to take the air.
The rose blushes as violently and
the violet is no whit less modest
when we stand in its presence. We
go home refreshed, but we do not
Write a sonnet. There is something
we must not have seen, which the
poets can see. They are prophets.
We are only plebeians. They see
symbols where we see only things.
They read messages, while we mere-
ly idle away time. They "write do)Vn
these messages and lo, it is poetry.
—o—
The Poets are purveyors of beau-
ty, and beauty exists but for those
who can preceive it. Beauty comes
of excellence, and only those- who
excel find kinship-.in.it, have the
power to appreciate it and to ex-
press that appreciation. We are
not poets, not because Nature is
partial toward others, but because
we are partial toward ourselves.
This partiality, sometimes called
selfishness, does not destroy the
beauty in Nature, but it turns the
eyes of our mind inward and so
closes them to the inward beauty
which lies outwardly in the souls
of men and things. The poet is a
man with outward eyes whose vis-
ion pierces to the inward beauty of
things. Excellence does jnot lie

on the surface.
the heart.
It springs from
And that is- the abode
of poetry. -Anyone can penetrate
to the surface of things; only the
poets can read the heart. Let us
grant them the crown of excel-
lence and say that Nature exists
for them.	—o—
If we must have consolation, let
us remember that “great men exist
that there may be greater men.”
Thus we who are not so great—or
are willing at least to admit that
w6 are not—may become greater
by cultivating the company of great
men. It is well that we are not all
equally great, for “men who know
the same things are not long the
best company for each other.”
—o—
It was a remark of Emerson
which stimulated these remarks.
Another zof his observations may
fittingly bring them to a close.
“Shakespeare, Homer, Dante, Chau-
cer, saw the splendor of meaning
that plays over the visible world;
knew that a tree had another use
than for apples, and corn another
than for meal, and the ball of the
earth than for'tillage and for roads:
that these' things have a second or
finer harvest to the mind, being em-
blems of its thoughts,. and convey-
ing in all their natural history a
certain commentary, on human life.”
If we cannot read the “splendor of
meaning” in the murmur of the
leaves or in the rustling of the corn,
we can at least read it when trans-
lated into the lines of the poet.

■ - A LETTER TO MY SISTER
J • • • Dear Sis:. — ■ ■	. ■
Tins morning I ran across a story in the morning paper which
contained a statement by President Charles J. Smith of Roanoke col-
lege in Virginia to the effect that the morals of college girls are worse
now than since the day Adam and Eve invented sin. The college head
went on to say that drinking among co-eds was abominable. And that’s
what I want to talk to. you about today, sis. ..	.
That old boy went pretty’far, I think, but still there’s a lot of truth-
in what he says. Do you remember, that-day I met you in Chicago
when we. were both going home for Christmas? Arid do you remember
the pretty girl in the-fur coat and turban that got off “The .Western”
just.as we were leaving? You said you didn’t know her, and you hoped
she wasn’t from your school.
- I’m young, sis; just as you are, arid I want to have a good time,
just as you do,.but let me tell you that I’d rather have them send’you
back in a white pine box in the baggage car than to have you step off.
the parlor car in the shape that girl was .in. I’ve never seen you take
a drink of anything yet, and I’m pretty sure you won’t, but just the
. . same let me tell you what goes, through a fellow’s mind when he sees
a sight like that. Then I know you won’t. ' -
I’ve always thought of girls-in comparison with mother, sis, and
J guess I’ll never think otherwise. So of course the first thing that
came to.my mind was: What would mother think of that? And from
that thought I began to wonder what this girl’s mother would have
done had she^been at that station to meet her. '	-	■ .
-Every, girl hopes sometime to be a mother. You know what we
. think of our mother. She, taught us all the great moral principles as
we knelt beside licr each night and said the “Our Father,” didn’t she,
sis? We have learned bigger names for them since then, but they are
the same old “don’t do this” and “always do this” of mumsie’s. It’s
hard to se where a girl, like'the one iri- the turban could ever make a
•_	" mother like that.: ..	'	~ •
' There’s another side to it, too, that hits ^bme of 'the girls. • They
think they, have'to drink when .they’re put with a bunch. ; Dorothy told
. -; me at one of the Christmas dances that she did it “just to be a good.
sport.” The fellows don’t marry the “good sports,” sis? They play
-around with them,“but.always find somebody else to propose to. Just
' stop and think a minute about: the “good sports”/at home who are
..■married. Nearly all of them.had to" find a man who didn’t know what
/ .“good,sports” they were.	/	\	-

Spectacular rises to fame are
rather common in . the . literary
world of ’ today. It is a peculiar
fact, however, that these artists
who find life colorful, ; romantic,
and kind, through • their personal
experiences, portray life in. terms
of bleak realism. Anzia Yezierska,
the poor Russian immigrant girl of
a few years ago, is an example of
this “school.” A short time after
landing in this country she begged
at the back door of the Waldorf-
Astoria hotel for a job. as dish-
washer or scrub-woman without suc-
cess. Two years later she was the
guest of honor at a banquet in the
same. hotel. Why does not some
of the romance she found in life,
some of the fairness,' at least, find
expression in her works?.. Probably
another case^of being too close to
the forest to see it for trees.
o—0
. “Children of Loneliness,”, a col-
lection of short. stories dealing'
with immigrant life, is the latest
realistic offering of Anzia. Yeziers-
ka. They have been compared, with
the works of O. Henry, so. should
be worth reading if./ only for the
purpose of investigating the valid-
ity of the comparison. .	‘	-

The Editor NOTRE DAME DAILY:
In regard to the question of a
suitable mascot for the University.
If you are acquainted with a few
breeds in the canine world, you will
agree with me,, and, I believe, the
' majority of the student body, that
there' is no mascot mor eappropri-
ate, more typical for this school,
than that thoroughbred of the ca-
nine world—the Irish Terrier!
B. K.
Editor the DAILY:
May a “long timer” make a
suggestion to the powers that be
through your effective columns
anent the high cost of class func-
tions?	...
There seems to be a violation of
the >“sacred traditions” - in the mat-
ter of class dance costs. The pro-
verbial vicious circle seems to be
operating full tilt. Last year’s
Freshman Frolic cost so much,
hence this year’s frolic must cost
something more; then the Soph Co-
tillion needs out-cost the Frolic,
the Prom,-the Cotillion and the Sen-
ior Ball must relegate the whole
bunch to the class of the pastoral
hoe-down by comparison.
The evil results-are many. In
the first place the game of follow
the leader is destroying class de-
mocracy, for many men, with all the
incidental expenses, are forced to
forego the pleasure of class par-
ties; Those men who are financially
able to “make” the dances are pay-
ing for something they do not get.
Real culture is confounded with
| costliness.
I ; The first Senior Ball, not so.many
years ago, was held in the gymnas-
ium at a fee of $5.00. It-would be
. a 'safe wager to say that the seniors
of that day got more real enjoyment
out of that dance than will the ’24
men get out of the affair this spring;
Think about it, S. A. C., think
about it. .	■	,

Worth of Senior
Ball Recognized
Proof of the success of former
senior balls at Notre Dame is evi-
denced /by communications received
by General Chairman Owen E. Des-
mond, inquiring as to the plans used
by Notre Dame in giving senior
balls. Such correspondence indi-
cates that Notre Dame is advanc-
ing socially as we.ll as in other
ways. .
The work of the Senior Ball
committee has become intensified,
and plans are materializing .more
speedily than had been expected.
Many valuable suggestion were
brought back by . committee mem-
bers upon their return to the Uni-
versity after the holidays. •
More than three-fourths.ofthe
questionnaires have been returned,
and the general attitude of the
members of the class in answering
the questions is gratifying. The
comic element which has character-
ized former ball questionnaires is
said to be entirely absent.

Valuable Works
Given to Library
As a souvenir of the Irish foot-
ball victory over the Army, Octo-
ber 13, 1923, the University library
has received some very valuable do-
nations.
The first is a donation made by
Honorable F. H. Wurzer, former
president of the Notre Dame Alum-
ni Association, of a precious vol-
ume entitled, “Tractatus de Regali-
bus ex Sacri Romani Imperi Con-
stitutionbus etcetra.” It is dated
1606 and was an heirloom in the
What Others Say
Wurzer family. This volume was
at one time the property of Mr.
Wurzer’s great-grandfather, Dr.
Ferdinand Wurzer, once President
of the University of Marburg, Ger-
many. Dr. Wurzer’s treatises on
chemistry and medicine are fa-
mous.
The second donation is from the
Very Rev. James French, assistant
superior of the Congregation of the
Holy Cross. It is a volume of the
early eighteens, entitled “Modern
1 Geography” and published by John-
son and Warner. This volume was
found by a land agent in the resi-
dence of Ex-President James K.
Polk, about the year 1913. It was
then presented to Rev. James XE.
Harlan, pastor of St. Joseph’s
Church, Edgerton, Wis.
Father
Harlan presented it' to Father
French, who in turn gave it to the
University library.
The Library’s third acquisition is
a critical study of the “Life, Letters
and Travels of Rev. Pierre-Jean De
Smet, S. J.” The study was done
in four volumes, by Crittenden and
Richardson, and was’ a gift from Ex-
President Theodore Roosevelt to
Rev. John C. York, pastor of St..
Bridget’s Church, Brooklyn, N. Yj
Father York had the four volumes
bound into one large volume which
bore the autograph of Ex-President I
Roosevelt. This study, therefore, i
is a rare addition to our priceless I
book collection. Father York!
placed particular emphasis upon the
fact that these books were presented
to the University upon the occasion
of Notre .Dame’s victory over the
Army.
Now that school has
started again— '

OUR SCHEDULE
Notre Dame’s football schedule
for 1924, as announced by Head
Coach K. K. Rockne, far surpasses
any other schedule that the Irish
have ever played, in fact, that any
school in the history of the Amer-
ican football has ever played. On
schedule appear games with six of
the nation’s major teams, and two
others that may not prove to be
walkaways.
The fact that so many .big teams
are to be met is not so outstanding
as the fact that they are to be met
on consecutive dates. Rockne has
always been noted for giving his
team plenty of hard games, but his
1924 schedule is more strenuous
than anything that has yet been
planned for any team.
Four home games and four trips
appear on the Irish schedule.
Probably the fact that the student
body has been clamoring for more
home games leads to this arrange-
ment. Also it will be remembered
by every one who saw the Huskers
win from- the Irish last Armistice
day, that Rockne has a world of
material, very little of- which is
lost to him by graduation this year.
With enough of capable substitu-
tions it is not impossible for a team
to go through a successful season
with such a schedule.
It seems, however, to be quite in
keeping with the general run of
affairs, that the Irish should be the
first to innovate such a stiff series
of games, since they have always
ranked abong the best teams in the
nation.
It will be noticed that the Ne-
braska game comes late in the sea-
son and is the peak of the Micks’
schedule. Next year’s game be-
tween the two schools should eas-
ily rank as one of the best among

NEBRASKA STATE SAYS:
Dear Editor:	.
While on a trip in the South dur-
ing the holidays, I had keen pleas-
ure in acknowledging myself a stu-_
dent at the University of Nebraska.
I went as far south as New Or-
leans and stopped several days in
Kansas City, St. Louis, Memphis,
and Merigold, Mississippi.
In Kansas City, when I said I
was from the University of Nebras-
ka, people exclaimed: “Nebraska?
Why, isn’t that the team that beat.
Notre Dame?” With a glowing face
I answered in the affirmative, and
described again the historic con-
test.
In St. Louis and Memphis it was
the same thing. Everyone I met
identified Nebraska as “the .school
that beat Notre Dame.”
A man in Merigold, Mississippi,
asked me about the game; if it
were a “fluke.” Earnestly and anx-
iously I denied it.
In New Orleans, a schoolboy
asked me about Dave. Was it true
he weighed nearly 200 pounds?
And could he run a hundred' yards
in ten seconds? He could, and
did.
The trip was not long, but I’m
sure that students of the Univer-
sity of Nebraska traveling anywhere
throughout the country would have
encountered a similar experience. '

PROSPECTS BRIGHT
FOR TRACK SEASON
All Events Except High Jump Well
Taken Gare of; Many Candi-
dates Are Out.
Prospects that the Notre Dame
track team will enjoy a successful
season in nearly every event, ap-
pear to be very good after consider-
ing the veteran material from last :
year, and the new stars that were -
uncovered on the Frosh squad last
season. The only event in which
there is a derth of material is the
high jump, and mindful of the fact
that •nothing short of a miracle
would develop a high jumper who
did not have some natural ability, ;
Coach Rockne issues a call to all
Jhe prospective high jumpers in the
school to come out for track. There
is a great, possibility that many
men in school have agility combined
with natural spring that would.make ;
varsity high jumpers out of them
with practice. With the close of ,
the 1923 season, Notre Dame lost
her* most promising jumper when ]
David Weeks matriculated in a
medical school.	'
To Meet Northwestern
In the sprints, quarter and half i
mile events, Rockne has , a wealth
of material, including several let- ;
termen who are working out in the
gym every afternoon in prepara- ,
tion for the opening meet of the
year with Northwestern in the gym.
Layden and Barr will be able to
z handle the short sprint events in
elegant style, considering the fact
that both men made brilliant show-
ings in the 1923 season. In the
Illinois games at Urbana, Ban-
nosed put Wisconsin’s best bet in
the 75-yard dash and rode past the
.finish line on the heels of Ayers, the
Illinois flash who won in :07:3-5,
tying the American and carnival
record.
The distance runs are supplied
_ with a strong force of candidates
x headed by Captain Kennedy, the
veteran miler, and. several members
-u of last year’s team. The remark-
able success of the cross-country
squad gave the Irish track fans a
splendid assurance that the Notre
Dame , cinder artists would consti-
~tute a-formidable field in the dis-
tance events during the coming
season.	;	.
Adam Walsh in Hurdles
Notre Dame will have two letter-
men back in the high hurdles to’
carry 'the colors of the Irish over
the tall timber. Adam Walsh, foot-,
ball captain-elect and one of Notre
Dame’s most versatile athletes, has
been showing great form- in the
early season work. Charley Casey,
who won his letter last spring, is
also nearing top form for the Pur-
ple meet.
- In the group of candidates out
for the sprints and the quarter
mile, Rockne will have a. fairly good
field from which to pick a relay
team. The mile relay team' has for
• years been one of Notre Dame’s
best track offerings, and not infre-
quently has the finish of the relay
run given the Irish--the meet at the
end of the program.
Coach Rockne announced yester-
day that freshman numerals would
be given out in basketball and track
under the following provisions: .
The freshmen , and interhall bas-
ketball teams will be given an op-
portunity to scrimmage with the
varsity five on the. “Y” court. Un-
der the direction of Coach Keogan,
the -yearlings displaying the best
work •will be considered for the
Frosh numeral.
Track Numerals Awarded ‘
In the track events^ the numerals
will be awarded on the following
basis, over which Coach Rockne will
have full charge: 100 yard dash,
;10 3-5; 220-yard dash, :25 44-5 in-
door, :24 outdoor; 440-yard run,
:57 indoor, :55 outdoor; half-mile
run, 2:14; mile run, 4:58; two-mile
run, 11:00;. high hurdles, :06 in-
dooi* (40 yards), :17 4-5 outdoor
(120 yards); 220 low. 'hurdles,
:28 4-5; high jump, 5 feet 5 inches;
pole vault, 10 feet; broad jump, 20
feet; discus throw, 105 feet; javelin,
140 feet.
The Freshmaji class has turned
out about 200 men for track and
basketball, and from all indications
some very good material will be on
hand for thfese two sports next
year.
Plans are under way to arrange a
dual meet for the freshman team
with either Culver or- Western
State. 1
The following men are candidates
for the track team:

The light quintet of cagemen
from Chicago sprung a surprise on
the crowd by the stubborn battle
they put up against the Notre Dame
five and displayed! a {remarkable
ability to dribble, pass and handle
the ball in tense situations. Cap-
tain Simunick of the Loyola five
was the headline performer for the
visitors and one of the cleverest
players that has appeared on the
local court this season. He handled
the ball with speed and sifted
through the Irish defense with ex-
ceptional agility, measuring his
pace to suit the situation, and en-
joying no little success in scoring
bn long shots.
Riordan, who played a good floor
game, was off form on basket shoot-
ing from the free throw line.. Crowe
and Kizer missed several baskets
by inches and not until the latter
part of the game did their real ef-
fectiveness become apparent, when
the speedy Crowe began to find the
basket. Mahoney playfed his usually
good defensive game near’ the bas-
ket, besides counting for six points
on the Irish score board.
Hard Game Coming
Coach Koegan will take the team
to Chicago for .the second game of
the series with Loyola next Thurs-
day night and will return to meet
Franklin college on the “Y” floor,
Saturday night. The downstate
school has been playinga brand of
basketball since the season began
that has been in keeping with the
usually fast teams that are turned
out at the Franklin school and Jias
earned for itself the title of hav-
ing the greatest basketball team in
the middles west.
Not since the Michigan game has
the Notre Dame five displayed the
form that beat the Wolverines, but
in the encounter Saturday night the

Irish will be "obliged to exhibit the 1
best game they know.	'

tre. The singing of this song was
a feature .at’the two performances
given Jast night. It was the general
impression - that. “Lonely” was ad-
judged the winning song because
of the originality - and simplicity
which. distinguished it from others
submitted.	'
Incidentally, LaBedz and Engels
are roommates, each of whom con-
tributed to the success of the jsong,
the .former by comppsing.’the music
for it and the latter by. writing the
Words. A prize of $25 was the re-
ward for their efforts.. Both are
Jvell known for their musical tal-
ents, being members of the Oliver
Hotel orchestra. (
LaBedz is a freshman in the Law
.department, while Engels is a soph-
omore in the Department of Music.
