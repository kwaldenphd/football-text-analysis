I have often pondered on Indi-
ana’s charming climate,, and I have
finally reached the conclusion that
the particular fate which controls
our weather is a firm believer in
that old saw: “variety is the spice of
life.” ’ Ye gods, lay off the spice.

“Verse’s What?” and with my cus-
tomary modesty I have chosen for
today’s selection a bit of verse
written (in feminine hand) by one
of the South Bend Sisters, who is
somewhat of an irregular reader of
this , column—to judge from the
nice things, she says. However/ to
keep you. acquainted with .what the

Chemists9 Program
Is Given by Sophs
The sophomores were the hosts
of the Chemists club at its meeting
last Wednesday evening and enter-
tained with a very suitable program.
The^ first speakei* was Vincent Gur-
nett, who gave an interesting de-
scription of a sulphuric acid plant
with, which he was connected. The.
next speakers were Henry Dillon
and William Foohey, who demon-
strated the use of a new indicator,
diphenylaimne.
Several prominent South Bend
chemists were, guests of the club.
At the meeting plans were made for
the club’s participation in'the S. A.

Fr. O9Hara Explains
Lenten Dispensation
Although students who do/ not
take their meals on the campus are
riot exempt from the Lenten fast
and abstinence, they may consult
their pastor or confessor for a com-
mutation or absolute dispensation,
Rev. J. F. O’Hara/ prefect of re-
ligion, said yesterday.
Those who make use of the dis-
pensation from? fast and. abstinence
are expected to' perform some work
of penance sucli as abstinence from
foregoing pleasures, amusements,
etc. If no. dispensation or commu-
tation is desired by a student, tak-
ing his meals off the campus he is
obliged, provided he is twenty-one,
to take but one full meal a day ex-
cept Sunday. ... . y ..	:
IRISH CINDER MEN
TACKLE WISCONSIN
Fast Indoor Meet on Notre Dame
Schedule; Wisconsin Has
Strong Aggregation.
Coach Rockne’s track team will
be seen in action for the last time
this winter when the Irish runners
and weightmen enter, a dual meet
with Wisconsin in the Irish gym at
2:30 this afternoon.
The Badgers will present a for-
midable aggregation and will un-
doubtedly give Notre Dame some
smart competition in every event.
The last meeting between Notre
Dame and Wisconsin: at Madison
resulted disastrously for the Irish.
Running for Wisconsin on the
two-mile team this year is Finkle,
who appeared here with the Badger
track team in 1922 for a dual meet
in the local gym. Finkle and
Baumer of Notre Dame were stag-
ing a little dual of their own in the
two mile with Baumer several
yards in the lead at the beginning
of the twenty-second lap. Finkle
endeavored to overtake Baumer by
unleashing a burst of speed. ' Just
as the Badger runner passed the
starting line’for the sprinters, he
collapsed with a broken ankle.
The Badger runner is one of Wis-.
consiri’s star cross-country men.
During the same meet, Merrick,
Wisconsin’s sensational pole vault-
er won-the event with a vault of
12 feet, 6 inches and made several
tries for 13 feet but failed. - Wis-
consin will bring a pair of pole
vaulters this afternoon that will
figure prominently in the western
conference indoor meet. . Both
s Jjqnes/^and^Hamjnarin ,?have een^
vaulting about 12 feet, 6 inches.

Play to be Given by
Mrs. Rice Tonight
Mrs. Elizabeth Pooler Rice will
make; her, first appearance, in the
middle-west when she entertains in
Washington hall tonight. She will
probably act a play which is the
dramatization of a series of -histdr-’
ical incidents in the history of Eng-
land. , The title of the production
is “The Passing of the Third Floor
Back,” by Jerome K. Jerome. It is
a play- of: the spirit .of Christ on
earth and , was made famous by
Forbes Robertson.
The Boston Transcript’ has ac-
corded , Mrs.; Rice the first position
among the play impersonating act-
ors of the country. . It was only af-
ter considerable effort that this dis-
tinguished reader agreed to ap-
peal* in Washington hall.
Elizabeth Pooler Rice is the wife
of. Phidelah Rice, who has given
readings here for the last three
years. Effort is being made to get
,Mr. Rice here for some, time during
May, as his readings, are always
of the highest type. If this dis-
tinguished reader will accept- the
invitation', to : give . a ' performance
here he' will be requested to give
the play . Hamlet. During summer
Mr. and Mrs. Rice conduct a sum-
mer school of expression at Mar-
tha’s: Vineyard. Island, Mass. Both
are members of the faculty of the
Leland-Powers x School- of Spoken
Word, and owners of the Rice

NOTRE DAME WINS
IN BOTH DEBATES
De .Pauw Defeated Here, While
Wabash Is Downed at
Crawfordsville, '
Notre Dame’s debaters won two
victories last night when the af-
firmative team won over De Pauw
University in Washington hall, and
the negative team defeated Wabash
College at Crawfordsville. Both
victories were decisive. The ques-
tion debated was “Resolved, that
the federal government should en-
act legislation providing for the
compulsory judicial settlement of
disputes' between employers and
employees in the coal and railroad
industries.”
The contest with Wabash Col-
lege was judged by Prof. Woolbur-
ton, of Illinois University, editor of
the Journal of Speech. The nega-
tive team was composed of John N.
Stanton, Edwin Lindeman, and
Lawrence Gran er, with David Stan-
ton, alternate. Notre Dame is said
to have outclassed its opponent.
In Washington hall the affirma-
tive side upheld the high standard
set by former teams.1 The decision
in favor of Notre Dame was ren-
cjered by Prof. Edgar G. -Frazier,
of Indiana University, who acted as
sole judge.
The debaters representing Notre
Daine were Victor. Lemmer, Sey-
mour Weisberger, and Oscar La-
very, while the negative • side was
upheld by Dale Parkerson, Benja-
min Habberton, and Robert Cush-
man of De Pauw. Weisberger and
Cushman were commended by the
judge of the debate on their abil-
ity. Deam Kbnop presided as chair-
man of'the debate. -t- “
The, Notre Dame . team showed
that judicial enactments of the fed-
eral government wefre absolutely
pecessary to prevent-the squabble
of capital and labor that caused the
public to suffer by interruption of
service in these two industries.
They advocated a' plan whereby a
living family wage was assured the
laboring class and protection
against accident, unemployment
and tyranny by capital. By dis-

ROCKNE A GREAT
TUTOR, SAYS CAMP
Fills Men With Courage and True
Sportsmanship, He Writes in '
Collier's Weekly. :
Walter Camp, father of football,
has this to say in Collier’s, for
March 8:
“Knute Rockne’s technical bril-
liance as a coach has been spoken
for by results, but I should like to
add that in a human sense Rockne
is one of the biggest .men: in Amer-
ican athletics.	.. , .
“The boy coached by Rockne will'
leave him with courage, good hu-
mor, a spirit of true sportsmanship,
and enthusiasm in his heart.. He
will need nd other weaporis with
which to withstand: the ' flying
tackles of fate.
“When I talked with him recent-
ly in Atlanta he. offered still fur-
ther evidence of his true greatness
as a man. He had not a .singlq
alibi to offer for the,unexpected de- <
feat of Notre Dame by Nebraska.”
GLOBE-TROTTERS
The next issue of The Scholastic .
will feature a group of travel arti-
cles • by some of Notre. Dame’s
globe-trotters.
Jack Scallan has sailed up the
Longueriay; Bert Dunne has been
merged in. the wonders of the Gol-
den Gate; and Al Sommer' once
roamed through Chinese parks and
shook hands with castaways. This
issue will'also be very rich in poet-
ry. A new page of reviews will be
begun by its sponsor, Joseph Burke.

CONGRESSIONAL HYSTERIA

rigid paths of righteousness must now quake in fear of Horrid expos-
ures. -Even though their digressions down,the byways have not been

Senator Heflin (Democrat, Alabama), .feeling, that, oil scandals
were not. the only national disgraces, has whispered new ;stories oyer
the senatorial, back fence? “Why,” said the Mrs. Grundy of the senate,
the other day, “there is a story to the effect that the attorney general
himself,. with Mr. Sinclair, went to the race track and bet money for
Cabinet members on race'horses; and that the one Daugherty bet on lost ;
that later he turned over some money .to Sinclair to bet and that Sinclair,
came back, with a bunch of:money and turned it over to him? and he
divided it and said: :	- ?	. ,	....	.	(
J h “'‘These*are;our winnings’; and then you talk about.being.silent'.”
2 My1 gracious! ". ,We:,can picture?the upright Mr...Heflin, hands-pn.
indignant hips, his horrified head stuck forward to emphasize the
scandalized and wagging, tongue and the shocked .expression of, what
we imagine to be, a borinetted face. : .. .
. . “I know that sorne do not want the people to know about these
tilings,” added Mr. Heflin, “but we are bringing them but for the pur-
pose of. showing how bad they look, and to serve notice bn public men
in the. future not to be guilty of such things. . . . . Oh, Mr. Presi-?
dent, the whole thing smells. ;to High Heaven 1” r
; Hurrah'for the senator! If we had more such unofficial chaperones
•watching for our welfare we might be .more certain of the millenium.
Today we shall look at the papers to see if anyone lias told about the
awful Senator, Lbdge picking his teeth in public, about the wicked Mr.
McAdoo’s playing penny ante last Christmas eve, and'about the dread-
ful Senator Walsh saying a cuss word fight out in front of two other

THE COLOR IZZVE	|
, i Eugene O’Neill’s new play, “All God’s Chillun Got Wings,” , is'
causing, much bitter.; criticism/, in the East, where the play may shortly
be produced. - 1:	: *	.	..
There are;characters, of both the white and the black/ races playing
principal parts in the. production, and the chief criticism seems to be
that the ^association of these principal characters reflects no credit on
the white race; but on the contrary; it tends to glorify the negro at
the (expense-of the white. In the play the/negro is, a model of virtue
and .honor and: a man of worth, while the two principal; white people
are a-seducer and a‘“weak sister,” ; .	.
" Oh the'stage tile best;way to handle the race question is to let it"
alone; The negro and the .white have each their place in our., country,
and these positions are separate and'distinct.: An attempt to mingle The
races/caiindt fail but to bring down a storm of protest which may lead
td?a revival of the. bitterness which is ever latent and liable to break
forth at the'slightest provocation. ■	' :	? \

THE INKW
By DENNIS J. O’NEILL
A.Lost Lady, by Willa Cather. Alfred
A. Knopf, New’York.
- There is always a middle ground
between two generations; always a
few unhappy souls. who are inti-
mately connected both -(with • the
grandfathers who are dying out and
with the grandsons who are rising
to take their places.; Such a one is
Marian Forrester, the principal
character of “A Lost Lady,” Willa
.Cather’s most recent contribution
to American letters. , She is the
most. vitally human character that
Miss Cather has yet.created; and
the story is the finest that she has
ever written.	‘
Marian, a young woman, marries
Captain Forrester, who is twenty-
five years her senior.. .The captain
is a road-builder; one of that in-
domitable group of men who open-
ed the gateway to the west during;
the latter part of the nineteenth1
century. She marries the captain
in sheer admiration of his strength
and courage, without due consider-
ation of the disparity between their
ages. All goes., well until an ’acci-
dent' .makes. the; captain a cripple
and breaks his health. He rapidly
shows his years, and Marian begins
to hear the call of youth.
Although she is in love with a
man.of her own age, innate;loyalty
keeps her at the side of the captain
until his death. Then instead of
dyingwith him, 'as. friends :who
idealized her expected, she clings
all .the closer to life. Instead of
linking;back to, years of retirement
in the quiet old house? on the hill
beyond Sweet Water, she. opens it
':6 the rising generation, more suc-
cessful and less idealistic than that
which it. is replacing. She becomes
a.lost lady in the eyes of. the,old
companions and ? co-workers of- her
husband. Eventually she sells the
house which had once been famous
for its hospitality from Omaha to
Denver, leaves the old familiar,
haunts, and goes to California. Here
she marries a wealthy Englishman;
but she is never quite able to for-
get the noble , captain? to whom, she
gave her best years.' - - - -. “ ? ’
There is a certain nobility about
the character of the captain. When,
he knows" the secret of :his wife’s
clandestine love affair and says
nothing about it, realizing the? men-.
; tai agony which he..must be suffer-
ing, the reader cannot help but
sympathize. It, is difficult to. deter-
mine which character is the more
finely drawn—that of Marian or
that of the. captain. :.
The story is delicate in structure
and ^exquisitely - told. It is remind-
ful of nothing so.,much as Booth
Tarkington’s “Monsieur Beaucaire.”
For some time it has been among
the Bookman’s, best sellers, and it
goes without saying that it is worth
reading.—J. C. P. .. .

Henry Brocken? By Walter de la .Mare/
New York. Alfred A.'Knopf. " 1924." - ■
The,;enthusiasm: lately born for
De la Mare has brought out sev-
eral volumes of his earlier works.
This early -prose - . piece, “Henry
Brocken” ; is of interest. as " an in-
sight into the’more simple " artistry
of:this amazing writer.
? (Some of the zealots of his works
are struck by the near poetry of his
prose—which is still but unrimed,
and irregular poetry. ; This Is more
actually •motic.eablq,. though, in :his
antecedent 'writings; Vhich do not
profess to1 depart from the poetic
realm of his naturally poetic mind;
and De. la Mare has lost but little
of the / childlike, wonderous touch
which he alone possesses, and which
runs, like colorful water through
his phrases, lopping and. twining
them together.	, .
The author of “Henry , Brocken”
will always be a dauber in words,
a seeker for effect, created by the
naked/ . beauty of :words—words
coined, and arranged to bring; out,
if not thought, symmetry. It ,is? con-
solatory to find in this matter-of-
fact day writer who has not ceased
to be carried off'in the chariot of
his dreams, one who may touch the
subtle' and .'yet weave in the phaff-
toms of the mists." This isjirecisex
ly the impression ? that “Henry
Brocken” radiates. .
There is exactly ‘ nothing to say/
about the specific contents of the’
book, it is immaterial at:the most.
One scents a weirdness; of mysti-
cism and -that is • all?—F." ;C? M. ";

In the Daily .Questionnaire of
last .Saturday .morning which con--
tains appreciations of the modern
college man by several girls pres-;
ent; at the Freshman" Frolic \ are
printed some opinions which should
make the social addicts of this and
of- every other university ponder;
College men have beeh" accuse'
tomed to be held up to ridicule by
preachers and ' editors rfor a long
time, but the thing didn’t " seem'to,
apply. to • us. Whenever, we' heard
a denouncement of college men, we
instinctively thought' of New’Haven
and Cambridge; we never imagined
that, we, at, Notre Dame were' in-,
eluded. The’ girls of ■ South' Bend
have dispelled'this notion, however,'
and right at one of the biggest so-
cial events ,of the year; -when " we
thought we were, making ,a most fa-
vorable impression. ..For1 these
opinions expressed areallj in some
degree at least, deprecatory of us;
and even, those girls who had. any
desire to make a- gracioiis reply
could not' do so. without revealing
an attempt?.to; sidestep the direct
question and an unwillingness to
compromise their candor by; ans-
wering irrelevantly. “If" their

The Palace show,’which has late-
ly been of a; decided in-and-out-
order, has returned for a short ses-
sion at “in.” Although there is
still plenty of room for improve-
inent, we hail this week’s bill as a
hbpeful change for the better. So
saying, he proceeded.
/’The O’Brien Sextette is compos-
of six (naturally) clean-cut
ypung men who wear purple coats
and play saxophones for their sup-
per. Some rather clever novelties
are'introduced, which seem to meet
with the popular approval.
; • Fred Lewis draws the quota of
jaughs for a normal comedy act,
a^d, incidentally, gets off the inev-
itable oil scandal crack. We sus-
pect that Fred could eliminate some
of the dull spots in his act if he
really tried. As it is, the offering
is fairly good.
i] Richards, Yule, and the Weldes
Sisters open show with something
njore interesting than the average
first act. Yule and Richards dance
well and the Weldes Sisters are
passable as- long as they stick to
playing musical instruments. They
shouldn’t sing, however, for the
the
same reason that a blind, man
shouldn’t go star-gazing. , ■
.! Saxton arid Farrell meet ’in' mid-

backs in approved vaudeville style.
Some of the jokes are funny and
sdme of them are old. The act is
in about the Buick class.
Gerker’s. Bruins are advertised
as appearing in “a bear of an act,”
which, you -will admit, isn’t much
of a joke. As for the animals, they
do plenty of stunts which aren’t in-
cluded in the ordinary program of

Should you have been improving;
your mind by reading this column,;
you have without doubt noticed our
usual attitude of patient optimispi.
But a jnan can be pushed so far,
and no~farther.. In justice to you,,
we find it necessary to inform you!
that “The Silent Command” is one'
of the season’s worst.
Secretary of the Navy Denby is
quoted as recommending it veryi
highly, but perhaps the secretary:
was too busy being investigated to
give the matter'much thought.
A very amusing- game, called
“Send the Wireless,” is introduced,
in this play. The object is to save
the Panama Canal from being
blown up by international scoff-
laws. The game is as follows: put
two men in a room on a specially
chartered ship, and install a radio
therein. One of the players tries
to wire to the Panama station to
keep all battleships out of the ca-
nal, and the other has for his object
to broadcast a message to his play-
mates to blow the old ditch galley
west. Any means at all are per-
missible to impede the progress of
one’s opponent. No holds are bar-
red, and anything that can be lift-
ed may be thrown. Gouging out
the eyes of the opposing player
adds zest to the game, and counts
ten points extra.	•
If the Canal is obliterated, the
loser is degraded/ from his rank in
the navy, arid if r it isn’t, the other
has to wear striped suits for four-
teen years.
The game must be played on a
stormy night, so the aerial can fall,
and any player that dies is disqual-
ified.
The first act of the vaudeville is
the McKay trio. The smallest side
of this triangle, a four-year-old, is

is clever.	•
The next consists of an octoge-
narian, with the mind and disposi-
tion of an avenue Arab, and his
flirtations. with a pretty neighbor,
(female, of course) who comes ovei’
to borrow his Victrola records. The
book of etiquette says that all per-
sons attempting to-borrow.Victrola
records should be shot on sight, not
flirted with, but it takes more than
a mere book to stop these magnetic
old sheiks.

Interhall Games
Played Tomorrow
Because of the interhall track
finals to be run off in the gym Sun-
day morning there will be but three
interhall basketball games played in
the gym tomorrow. The two morn-
ing games, Brownson vs. Cadillac,
and Walsh vs. Corby, will be played
later in the week. The Day-Badin
contest will be played in the gym
next Tuesday night at 8 o’clock.
This will leave the hour of 3:30 va-
cant and one of the morning games
can be arranged to be played at
this hour.
The Sorin-Carroll battle will
probably be the most hotly con-
tested battle on the schedule Sun-
day, as Sorin has been close on the
leader’s trail all season. The
Freshman-Sophomore game also
promises to be fast, as both teams
are tied in the interhall- basketball
standing.
. The protest brought up by. Day
over the Carroll-Day game . last
Sunday,: was settled Thursday
night at a meeting of the Athletic
Board by awarding the game to
Carroll.
Following is the schedule for iri-
terhall. games:

Public Speaking
Stage Is Improved
A small stage, having all the es-
sentials of a little theatre and con-
sisting of a proscenium arch, flood,
lights and drapes has been erected,
in the. larger of the two public,
speaking class rooms in the base-
ment of Walsh hall, to give the,
students the opportunity of work-
ing under conditions conducive to'
work, and also to give them every-,
day experience of speaking under
lights and surroundings that -will be
encountered upon any stage. It
has the qualifications of a little
theatre in that it bas a seating ca-
pacity of 75, stage 16x16, with
drapes and floods.
The lighting system, installed by
the campus electric shop and tin
shop,, is a method brought forth by
the little theatre riiovement. It
abolishes foot-lights . and adopts
floods, both on the apron and in
the border. These floods are
equipped with five different colored
gelatine slides, from which it is pos-
sible to give the drapes nine distinct
colors.
The panoramic drapes are of a
dark gold color, giving the stage
an illusion of greater' depth and
height. The effect of the stage on
the speaker makes the same de-
inand on the voice as does an audi-
torium.
The stage settings -will remain

: Bob Regan will be assistant foot-
ball coach at the University of Utah
for the 1924 season. The signing
of Regan marks a new era for
Crimson ■ athletics. It means that
the. University of Utah will have
trained men to develop the Crim-
son gridiron machine. The cry of
football critics of the West has not
. been the lack of material, but the
lack of trained men to develop that
material.
“Chuck” Kearney, former Creigh-
ton star arid greatest of present-day;
basketeers,. annexed a total of 46
baskets in a professional game in
Denver .recently. Kearney is the
outstanding star in Denver loop cir-
cles and daily encomiums appear
in the- papers regarding his skill.
Kearney is now coaching, 'the Colo-
rado School of Mines’ quintet. Out
of mediocre material, “Chuck” has
’developed a group of leather sink-
ers that is making a strong bid for
the Rocky Mountain title. .
, Paul Berlenbach scored his 26th
consecutive knockout the other
night when he delivered the sleep
producer to Jimmy Darcy at Madi-
son Square Gardens.
Berelenbach has the qualities;
that characterize a champion and
with a little more experience he
will be ready for the best in his
class. Paul will probably enter the
light-heavyweight class when he- is
of championship calibre. He is un-
able to make the middleweight limit
; and generally tips the scales at 168.
Down in. the Giants’ spring train-
ing camp one of the first orders to
, be issued "with regard the 'daily
workouts was the rule abolishing
all golfing, paraphernalia. , McGraw,
although an ardent devotee of the
little Scottish pastime himself, de-
cided that the ball club could not
mix golf and baseball.
..The Giant boss gave golf a back
seat when it came to an essential of
a winning ball club. The tempera-
ment evoked by the 'respective
games is almost totally in conflict
... and a good golfer cannot play good
baseball. Baseball has it all over
golf when it comes to the matter
of required ability, action, ,and
clear thinkirig. At least one of the
' virtues needed, for golf is patience.
; Each game has its good qualities
but when a golf club is brought out
on a baseball diamond, you have a
cross between a track team and a
tennis team.
> -One of the side-lights in the os-
. trasization of golf from the train-
ing camps, is the fact that. Speaker
allows' his pitchers ' to play golf,
figuring of course, that their usual
batting average will hot be affected.
