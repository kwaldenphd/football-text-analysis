DR. J. WALSH GIVES
INTERESTING TALK
FREAK CURES EXPLAINED
DISCUSSES CONTROL OF
MIND OVER MATTER
Dr. James J. Walsh, noted, au-
thor and neurologist of New York
City, spoke in Washington hall last
night. “Curious' Cures” was his
subject. ' Dr. Walsh gave, examples
' of the. many ways in which people
have been hoodwinked into believ-
ing themselves cured of various ill-
nesses during the past centuries.
Among these was the Leyden Jar
cure. In this people .were cured by
receiving shocks from. this jar.
Headaches, neuraliga, lumbago and
like ailments all fled before these
shocks.	.
Another .example was that of
curirig by magnetism, founded by
the great Dr. Held of the Univer-
sity, of Vienna. Tri'this it was be-
lieved that by placing magnets over
the diseased organs that the pain
'could.be drawn from.the body.. To
.faciliate this work the magnets
were shaped to conform with the
. outline of the parts to be treated.
Thus they were formed as hearts,
. livers, ears' and the like. Strange
to say, people; came from all over
Europe to be treated and thousands
were cured. '
'7 Dr. Walsh mentioned many other
; freak cures known 'to the medical
profession, and explain them by
i saying that those which were ef-
fected ,.were' purely of the mind.
/The enc.Q.uyagement__thus . offered
' was sufficient- to overcome the ideas
in people’s minds that they were
afflicted. “Had .the affliction been
of the body, they would have been
unsuccessful,” he said.- ,
■ His lecture'.was interspersed .with
bits of humor and ridicule of the
..gullibility of people, regardless of
rank or education, and was most
• interesting. . ’	•

GLEE CLUB IS WELL
RECEIVED ON TOUR
APPLAUSE- AND DANCES
GIVEN TO CLUB IN
• FIVE CITIES
ARE
The Notre Dame Glee club com-
pleted its annual Easter concert
tour when it sang the Hike Song
in Sandusky,' Ohio, last Friday eve-
ning. That this arid the other other
concerts given were successful is
attested by {the. favorable, news-
paper comment that followed every
appearance of the club.
The first concert of the week,
Monday night, was predented in,
Cleveland under the auspices of the
Notre Dame Alumni association of i
that city. An appreciative au-,
dierice pronounced it to be musical-
ly excellent. Followingthe concert
Harry' Denny’s Collegians played a
program, of dances in the ballroom
of the Statler. Hotel, where the cori-
•-cert—was-givenr—Denny’s-band- at-
tacted much favorable attention in
Cleveland.
The Akron Armory was the place
of the next, successful, concert and
dance on Tuesday. Following an
inspection of several tire factories
the club reached Niles on Wednes-
day, where the local Knights of Col-
umbus sponsored ■ the songsters.
This was a return concert and this
year’s organization was met with
even greater enthusiasm than last
year’s. A dance entertained visi-
tors and townsfolk during, the later
part of the evening.
Elyria heard -the Glee club on
Thursday, National Notre Dame
night/ and Under the influence of
the day and. Joseph Casasanta, as-
sistant director, the club sang ex-
ceptionally well. -Features. of the
dance here were “Broom,” -and
“Whistle” dances, new to most
of 'the Notre Dame men. The last
stop on the trip was in- Sandusky.
Following the customary concert
the collegians were ‘ entertained at
a, riiost . enjoyable dance given by
the Knights of Columbus.
All in all'jthe recent tour dis-
played /well the careful training of
the club under Dr. Browne, and
Joseph Casasanta. Dr. Browne di-
rected only the . Cleveland and
Akron concerts, the rest being
guided by the hand of Casasanta
The tendency of the club this year
away from the' lighter music to a
program that is more firmly fixed
on the classics appeared to be un-
.defstood and appreciated by trie
audiences.	f :
Last Sunday afternoon'.the Glee
club sang several numbers at ’ thes
South Bend High school as part of
the program opening Boy Week in
the city. The annual South' Bend
concert and dance will be presented
on May 9, at the Palais Royale.

MICHIGAN PLAYS
HERE TOMORROW
ANCIENT RIVALS HOOK-UP ON
CARTIER FIELD FOR
HARD GAME <	•
All the fire and zest of an ancient
rivalry will be rekindled tomorrow
afternoon on Cartier field when
Coach George Keogan’s: baseball ;.
nine takes the field against the
University of Michigan team. The
Irjsh' have lest two ganies since
they took the .road to Georgia a.
fortnight .ago and' Captain Billy
Sheehan’s ball club’will be In fight-
ing trim wheri the Wolverines come
to Notre Dame tomorrow.
The encounter with . the locals
marks the . fourth game on the
Michigan regular card and the
Maize- and Blue is being pointed
for a sweeping victory. In the lorig
diamond series between the two
schools, the Michigan schools has
copped th majority of the games.
Last year’s game on Cartier field
went to the Wolverines on a wild .
pitch, 11 to ’ 10., The return game
at Ann Arbor went by the boards
in favor of Michigan 12 to 44.
Michigan has not experienced the
first lap of the 1924 season without
a few bobbles, an injury depriving
the Ann Arbor of. the team’s hea-
viest hitter. Several of the men
on the squad are playing their first
year in varsity ranks. Two of their
outfielders and three of the in-
fielders are making their first ap-
pearance under the Maize and
Blue. Steger, Dillman, Wilson and
Bachman are expected to be the
most promising sluggers on. the
squad although in the games played
. -thus.far,_they-have not_shownr4b*^~ :.-
b est in the slugging game. Stager
has returned to the diamorid sport
'after an absence of several years
and appears to be the most power-
ful batter bn the squad.
The Michigan coach has been der
voting much of the practice, time to
perfecting the defensive game of
his diamond performers. George
.Haggerty, star of Michigan’s; bas-
ketball quintet will cover the third
sack and has been doing remark- .
able, work around the “hot corner”
since the season opened.
Stryker and Benson are counted v
among Michigan’s pitching staff as "
the leading twirlers. In the Mic
igan Aggie game, the. moundsme
performered in creditable fashion
and the support that was allotted .
.the ..pitcher whs unwavering but
Michigan finds. itself weak at bat
and together, with the defense
game, the Wolverine coach has laid
particular stress on batting prac-
'tice.	■ •
The Keoganites are x prepared to
•face an afternoon of hard compe-
tition and with infield and outfield
working, in top notch fashiori, the
Irish will be in good shape to.re-'-
pell trite bnslorighter of the in- ’
vaders. The inimitable Nolan, will •
be on the initial sack, with Quinlan
on second, Sheehan at short, and
either ; Pearson; or Predergast on
third. ■■■The coach' will .have a large ■
assortment from which to select an ■ '
outfield, the reserve strength in the
outer garden being one of the fea-
tures of this year’s. squad.
GIPP MEMORIAL PLANS
ARE NEAR COMPLETION
. .The plans for, the erection of the
Gipp Memorial .will- be completed by '
the S. A. C. within the next month.
The contemplated memorial is to -
be of bronze, and will probably be
erected out-ofrdoors until some
building is built with a suitable
place for the tablet.	. 1

MURPHY, AND HIS WORK.
Probably few events will have a greater effect upon this year's
presidential campaign than the death of Charles F. Murphy, Tammany
chieftan and national Democratic potentate.	-
/ ? Thirty ydars.ago, an humble horse-car driver, he left the barns of a
' New York traction company to try his hand'at pratical politics. Twen-
ty-two years ago1 he took, over -Richard Croker’s. handiwork and made it
the most powerful and continuously successful political machine :.n’thc
world; 'Friday-the United States Senate mourned when its members
‘learned of his passing, one of the rare, times in our national history that
the death of a private citizen had been reported in its chambers.
•	/ .There, briefly, is the life of; Murphy, party strategist, master of
‘ men "and maker of presidents" "It tells its own story'of the man. '.His'
, . influence -will certainly live-after him, as negative this time as it~was
positive in years past. Flis removal probably, means the elemination
' ' t ■ from active candidacy of. the man .whose high political character, ability
and foresight his astuteness had brought forth, and developed. Whether
. it will end the power, of Tammany, as did the death of an equally skill-
ful machine leader in an adjoining state, is a question for timd to an-
swer. It is-doubtful-, however, for such was his hold and influence that
he seldom permitted rebellious spirits to break the bonds of party
' fidelity, which he held indispensible.	.	*	i ’
What factors contributed to'his rise and long success? Hard to
tell, but certainly not the least were his utter faithfulness to friends, his
personal charm and magnetism, his sympathetic understanding, of hu-
/' <man nature, his sincere desire to shun publicity and his own glory, his
. '■ thorough-going belief in the efficacy of party conduct of government,
. and his aggressiveness in combat. ■
a:	Power though he was in; state and- nation, and all-embracing
- though the- machine he directed; his happiest memory may be, that, in
A ' the long years of activity in a game the record, of which is filled with
x . . -mdny'a sordid page, no world has ever been uttered against his char-
r acter and integrity. .	’:	;

the features of this year’s squad as
shown by their work,in the Loyola
game. Vergara, Farrell and Crow-
ley performered in creditable- fash-

Badin Takes Lead in
Interhall Ball League
Freshmen defated Corby 8 to 7
in eight innings, and Badin won a
seven inning contest from Sopho-
more 6 to 1 in the only two Inter-
hall baseball games played Sunday.
Rain in the afternoon held up the
other games.
After trailing Corby for seven
innings, the Frosh team connected
with Lefty Tathem’s offering for
three runs in the eighth and em-
erged victors by one point. Corby
batters hit Eirk, Frosh pitcher, for
two runs the first frame and added
two more the second. The Corby
'squad was leading by a safe mar-
gin, and from, all appearances had
the game won until the last two in-
nings. Both hurlers pitched a nice
game and the work cf the fielders
showed improvement over previous
encounters.

particular significance for several
American universities - and colleges
that have hopes of being represent-

summer. Both events mirrowed the '

Tom Lieb of Notre Dame who

competing under the colors of the I.

American choice in this event and
Xvill be accompanied to Paris by two
more of the nation’s leading discus

With the steady improvement
that has marked the work of Gene

and the return of Angiers after his
injuries have been taken care of,
the field, of javelin performers will
include a number of notable per-1
