“Notre.’ Dame men should be
proud of their.'unblemished record
of good relations with South Bend.”-
This was ■ the/ substance of the
statement of. the Ho.ri. Eli. E. See-
birt,' mayor' .of South. Beridi. given
yesterday, .as he .ebhiriierited^bri the
relationship: of. the. growing Notre
Dame and; the growing South: Bend.
He was anxious for,: the good- rela-
tionship .to continue, arid'-was sure
that, it would: continued .-“Duririg
the periods of overflow at the Uni-
versity,”^ he ' said; “when the Uni-
versity - has been: unable; < to; accom-
mb'date all of its students on-' the
campus, South Bend, has -welcoiried
to its bosom the overflow, and cher-
ishes them as an excellent , part of
its citizenship.”:	\	. • , .. .
liy view of the recent disorders at
other universities, he. said, it-is es-
pecially remarkable that: there. has
not been a single police controversy
between' 'the. municipal ’ authorities
of, .South Bend and any students
during The' two years he, has. been
mayor of the city. '•	. w - ■;
Notre'Dame is fortunate in that
the ‘ city, on The south, has as mayor,
Mr; /Seebirt, -a vcleah-cut, . straight-
forward man, a splendid type of
the. best men “who are hd,w: directing
the': most progressive cities of the
country. - He is broad-minded and

“The growing ' South Bend arid
the growing Notre Danie have an
unusually cdmrnon' interest now,”
said' Rev. Dr. . Matthew J. Walsh,
president of the University, this
rooming. He coiri'mented on the fact
that South .Bend: is rated- .first as
regards ratq of progress in recent
business • reports,- . and that* Notre
Dame is - now expanding' into a
greater Notre Dame. /	. . '
- The. feeling of friendship that.has
existed between Notre Dame and
South Bend. is stronger now than
ever before, he said. . ' '	'
.“The DAILY,” he- further re-
marked,. “is just another., indicaitbn
of the growth of the school and the:
need of a ihedium that ca'n quickly
and adequately chronicle the- vari-
ous activities : associated with col-
lege life,’ (-I think it will be partic-
ularly serviceable in bringing to the
attention of the people of South
Bend 'just what the daily. life at
Notre Dame.is, and. at the same time’
afford the students .an ^opportunity
to record, in seasonable-time what
is .happening in: South Bend. The
growing field of. friendship that has
characterized the relations..of N.otre

RELIGION AND POETRY. '
The-Ballad of. St."Barbara, ‘by- Gilbert K.
. ; Chesterton. 85 pp. G. P. Putman’s Sons.
•-London. and New York. - §2.50;' . - ;
■ . .Perhaps the preface to the Amer-
ican edition is more-interesting than
any of .the poems. - Chesterton-.has
had the singular, opportunity to -an-
swer the critics of his- .poems who
had read his English edition. -.- One
of .these gentlemen reminded--him
that as modern people;'for the most
part, are/’agnostic and sensitive of
the -fact, he should not write about
religion- .in • such; loud syllables.
Chesterton, disagrees, . as ■ he does
with another. who criticises -his use
of ^cheerful meter -in controversial
verse,, to whom he writes, “I do-not
understand why any verse: that; sug-
gests/a battle must .necessarily sug-
gest a defeat.” •	' -
■ . What -would‘be of particular in-
terest to •< Catholics, because -of his
recent conversion, -is his. poem, “The
Convert”: -	,	«
•After-one moment-when T-bowed my head
And-the: whole?world turned over-and came
. upright,,
And4I; came out-where the-old-road, shone
white,
L,walked the: ways • and • heard- what, all men
g?-!;said/^ /.?<?:?.<:;'/.-^	-}}}y X;}
Forests of . tongues,' like ' autumn leaves
unshed,
Being- notrunlovable butf strange and: light;
Old riddles 'and new screeds nor ‘ in. despite
But-; softly, , as. men smile about the dead.
•The.sages -have a-hundred maps to. give - -

That stores ‘the sand and lets the gold go

And all these, things are less than dust to
me	, '’
Bedause my name is Lazarus and I live.
- The book is crammed with satire,
as brilliant as his epigrams. His
“Songs of Education” are as clever
as anything that has been printed,
in America in the past few .years.
The poetry gives a side of Chester-
ton which everyone should .know.
The'little poem, his guild songs,
“Nightmare,” ‘ “A Second Child-
hood,” and “The Trinkets” give the
reasons for Chesterton’s increasing
popularity as a poet.—-G. H.
. THE MERCHANT. MARINE
The Merchant Marine, by Admiral William
S. Benson;- (Knights of: Columbus His-
torical Series.) The MacMillan Com-
pany, New York and Chicago. §1.75. .
Although not the first'of its kind.
Admiral William S. Benson’s new
treatise on “The Merchant' Marine”:
“A Necessity in time of war;' a
source of independence and strength
in time, of peace,” is. well -worth the
attention of every real/American.
The book, is written for the public
as well as for the student, and is
both timely-and interesting.- Notre;
Dame men in particular should wel-;
come its appearance, for the author
was honored with the Laetare medal-
in 1917, and has always had'the
interest of Notre Dame at heart.
It has been chiefly through Admiral
Benson’s influence that Notre .Dame
has been granted the privilege, of
sending her ,■ students • to foreign
lands.every, summer on U. S. gov-'
eminent ships.	’ ■	’
। But' apart from these consid-
erations, the book is the work of a’
real authority;, No man in America
is better informed' on the. merchant
marine than . Admiral Benson. . A;
graduate of'the 'Naval. Academy, a
hero of many maritime adventures,
a voyager into- every part of the
world, and. a naval officer of the
highest 'ability, he: has had .a wide’
and varied career;- Upon- the death
of Admiral Dewey, Admiral Benson
became the highest ranking officer
in the ?navy. As chief of naval
operations during/ the : war, he di-
rected the activities of our entire
fleet,’ and was so busy .that,, as he
himself, once - remarked, “I slept
within arm’s, reach of a .telephone.”
Admiral Benson was subsequently
naval advisor to the American peace
commissions in Paris,- 1919 .and. in
1920was' ■ appointed chairman . of
the - shipping board - by President'
Wilson.- .He is stilLa ' ember,, havr

.MASKS AND MARSHES
’ / “Behind Masks,” the screen adap-
tation of "E. Phillips Oppenheim’s
novel, .“Jeanne ■ of the Marshes,”
was - Saturday’s attraction at the
Blackstone. It concerns a convent
. girl, an heiress (as all convent, girls
are in the movies), who is seeking
one who will love, her, for herself
alone. Most of the action takes
' ■. place in an old English manor with
. secret passages and an air of mys-
tery. Any plot which can provide
secret passages, a smuggler’s 'cave,
a .misunderstood jhero, and a man
who is supposed to be murdered has
all the ingredients of a hit; no
more seems to be. necessary. • <

RELIGION AND POETRY
The Ballad of . St. Barbara, ’ by. Gilbert K.
. Chesterton. 85 pp. G. P. Putman’s Sons.
-/ London'and New York. . $2.50." : ■ ' ■
, Perhaps the’; pref ace to the Amer-
ican edition is more interesting than
any: of the poe^s. /.Chesterton has
had the singular opportunity to an-
swer the ‘critics of his poems who-
had r^adhis English ' edition; One
of these . gentlemen- reminded him
that as modern’people, for the most
part, areagnostic and sensitive of
the fact, he. should not write about
religion " in such- loud,., syllables.
Chesterton , disagrees,: as he does
with another who criticises his use
of cheerful.-meter. in ( controversial
verse, to whom he writes, “I do not
understand why. any verse that sug-
gests .a battle must necessarily sug-
gest a defeat.” / , -
. What would-be of particular in-
terest, to Catholics^ because-of -his
recent Conversion; is his poem, “The
Convert’’:. '.
After: one-moment .when I bowed n(y head
And the whole world ^turned over and came,
upright,
And I came' out'.where the old’ road shone

- =The book is crammed-with satire,
as brilliant' 'as , his, epigrams. His
“Songs of.Education’’:are as ’clever
as anything that has been printed
in America^ in the past few years.
The poetry gives a side of Chester-
tori which everyone should . know.
The little poem, his. guild songs,
“Nightmare,” ’ “A Second . Child-
hood,” and “The Trinkets” give the
reasons for Chesterton’s increasing
popularity as a poet.—G. H. -
, THE MERCHANT MARINE
The .Merchant Marine, -by Admiral William
S. Benson. (Knights of Columbus His-
torical Series.) ■ The .MacMillan Com-
pany, New York.and, Chicago. .$1.75.
Although ;not the first of its kind,
Admiral William S. Benson’s new
treatise on “The Merchant Marine”:
“A; Necessity- in time of war; a
source of independence and strength
in time of peace,” is .well worth the
attention of, every real American.
The book is written for the public
as well as for the student, and is
both timely and interesting. Notre
Dairie men in particular should wel-
come its' appearance^ for the .author
was honored with the-Laetare medal
in 1917, _and has" always’ had the
interest of Notre Dame, at heart.
It has been chiefly through Admiral
Benson’s influence that Notre Dame
has been granted the privilege of
sending her students to foreign
lands every summer on U; S. gov-
ernment ships.' .
But apart ; from these consid-
erations, the- book is the work of a
real authority. No man in America
is, better informed on the merchant
marine than Admiral Bensori. A
graduate of the Naval Academy, a
hero of; many maritime.adventures,
a yoyager into . every; part’ of the
world, and,1 a navai officer of the
highest ability,, he has . had a- wide
and varied;career. Upon the death
of Admiral Deweyj^AdmiraTBenson

in; the navy;. As chief; of naval
operations during the war, he' di-
rected the activities' of bur-entire
fleet,; and? was; so busy that, as he
himself -.once remarked, . “I slept
within arm’s reach of a telephorie?’

The .Story of Notre Dame as it Grew . '.
from the Wilderness to Now, as it '
.	: Grows to the Greater Notre'Dame
Father Badin Built on Sandy Shores of St. Mary’s, and was Followed by Father Sorin Who
Aided the University to Progress During Trying Times; Many Things Interfered
to Prevent Growth but the Spirit of Her Founders Inspire Those who Follow
Notre Dame is rich in tradition. She was born in the .days when Indians tramped.the banks'.of the
wooded St. Mary’s and as she grew up, her interesting traditions have grown up with her. THE NOTRE
DAME DAILY believes that its. most interesting weekly feature would be of these traditions. It is fitting that
. the features begin with a general sketch—a history of Notre Dame crowded into a few hundred words.





EARS BEFORE a tiny frame
shack, the . Notre Dame of- ’43,
was built on the shores of Saint
. Mary’s, lake, Father Badin had wan-
■ dered over the'sandy lake-region of
-Northern Indiana and Southern
’< -Michigan, on 'his lonely, solitary
, . ; .mission. . He had said' mass, for the
. /native Indians somewhere near the
vSpot where now stands the restored
—^-—LogjGhapel.’l Maj^Luette; the elobp^
‘ .trotter,, had "also-/crossed1r"an3/;re^
- ■ crossed the ■ Saint Joseph River not
(, far from Saint Mary’s. 'And aYull
: - century and a half before the land
>■ ■ : beneath the dome had been hallow-
- • ed by the labors .of. Father .Claude
. Allouez, the Jesuit.' '	-	-	-
. -	;But-the permanent work .which
\ - was: to; result ~in the' greater 'Notre
• Dame was left .for the industry and
genius -of a Father. Edward Sorin,
: the . dreamer who . achieved -his
' dreams.	-	‘
..'	-. No visitor at, Notre, Dame should
-‘ .board -the .south-bound Hill -Street
.. car . without. -h a vi n g wandered
. : through the little, cemetery where
. for more than half a century the
K • staunch co-laborers and successors
. of Father. Sorin have been. laid ‘to
, • rest, silently and obscurely. There,
< :-on wind and. rain-worn iron crosses
. that raise, their uniform heads above
. . the" grass,'is told something of the
sad story of ’54. Jn the plague of
? - -that year twenty of Father ■ Sorin’s
• , 'fellow religious were carried off.
Twenty of the laborers, whose work
, i . Had scarcely begun, of whom such
- prodigious, . things , were' expected,
. gathered in one. stroke into, the bot-
, 'tomless bag . of -the Reaper! -The
" < twelve-year old Notre. Dame, so
, many of whose protectors had been
;.s! ■ taken,, trembled at' the 'cold of the
threatening storm. -But then the
' mighty arm c«f Father Sorin drew
■ into the congregation’s fold more of
.	: the/ blood which, had' returned to
. dust. French/ Irish/ English < and
- ; Gernians, they came and set to work.
Then a quarter of a century later,
: .<: in came. the. ,great disaster/ the
. : . fire- Judge Howard, who lived and
/ ■ developed, with> sNotre, Dame, has
; often told how Father Sorin faced
; that stupendous calamity. Every-
. thing .seemed, fallen, all that had
, ■ f::r.esulted from years of unceasing
. - ■ , ^oil. Yet the founder was calm,
: :. - --implacable. ■ “We’ll all get togeth-
•. v. er,” he1 said. to. Howard < and the
others, “clear away the ruins and
. build again.” ■ .... , 1
; ■ ■ With the,. Civil War came another
‘ ; Breat test .for - Sorin and Notre
v.; -4 Dame.,.- But Father .Sorin’s Amer-
। ieanism. was x quickly established.
Struggling’; as he was to preserve a
• haby. university - in -what was then
the sparse,Northwest, he spared his
. hest men - to the Union army as
; <:। chaplains, ..imposing;, double cares’
/ :'• 4,nd. duties upon himself - and / those
i left at home. ,	•''	‘ ‘ .
. When .Father Sorin, and his'six





pioneering Brothers came to Indi-
ana they had to start a university
on - almost nothing—there -was no
equipment/no shelter, and but'lit-
tle help. The white settlers- of- ’42
were few, just a scattered repre-.
sentation of hardy ■ way-makers,
whose hands were more accustomed
to the,axe and musket than to the
prayer-book. Many of them were
French^-Catholics from the^yicinity
Sf DetrDit/^aifa^b"?these -Father
Sorin: gave spiritual- guidance. The
Indians were grateful for. his pres-
ence, for now those who had been
converted by Allouez: or Badin had-
a real; live “resident pastor.” ; .
Father Sorin planned .from the
start that Notre Dame -should be
more than a missionary , outpost.
He wanted a college, a. college of
arts and letters, even though there
were only himself and- six Brothers
to teach, and at the same time to
build something of nothing in the
wilderness. But, slowly at first and
in gradually ^increasing numbers,
the vanguard :.of. the - present great
Catholic student body came filter-
ing in. • The >- class of ’62, whose
members, like the men ■ of ’17, ’ re-
turned from the army -to receive
their degrees, numbered-five men,
all Bachelors of Arts. . Among them
was T. E. .-Howard, who worked - his
way. through ■ the university by
teaching,
judge of
diana.
and who later became
the supreme court of In-

- Father Sorin .was' by nature a
leader, a builder, a man of decisive
and . thoroughly-conceived action.
His intellect<was grasping and pow-
erful, but, most important, he pos-
sessed those qualities; high, purpose,
readiness for sacrifice,'courage, en-
ergy, faith, which have at all times
been indispensable for the success
of great pioneering enterprises.
>* To minister to the growing baby
university came a score or more of
talented . men who gave all theii’
efforts to raising the child into a
lusty youngster, but who have gone
into , eternity almost unknown. Then
came such great Fathers as Corby,
the Dillons, -Gilespie and Lemmon-
ier, such.sterling, brothers as, Neil,
Leopold and Gerard.. Father .Thom-
as • Walsh stands midway between
the Notre Dame of the pioneer days
and the school which is more prop-
erly; of our days. : He was . a man
standing firm, on the same ideals
that sustained Father Sorin—a man
of talent,.- culture, vision, piety; yet
he died; a few .‘months before Father
Sorin. ‘	' -
. And so .with the passing of Father
Sorin :• was . inaugurated the era
which saw the work .of such great
educators and builders. as Fathers
Zahm,”, Morrisey,' Cavanaugh; and
Burns. Laymen also , have played no
small, part in. stimulating the prog-'
ress -that..has led -to. .the. present?
■With “Father Sorin . there eagerly


labored such, professors as Lyons
and Howard; later, came- Colonel
Hoynes, Professor McCue/Maurice
Francis Egan, Charles Warren Stod-
dard, and. Austin O’Malley. Led by
such men as thesd, how:could Notre
Dame have failed to rise to the pin-
nacle of Catholic ■ scholarship and
manhood?
Notre Dame is now an octogena-
rian, ._yet; still? only, a. healthy child
as' ~ universities'^ go:^'- Even''; though;
her - place .is well-established in
American life/ even though'she rep-
resents what the finest Catholic en-
deavor in America can do, her life
is only beginning. f i On more and
more splendid- men, on more: and
more sturdy, halls is. the golden
Dome beaming down each year, yet
the future will not pass without-her
gleams reaching into every ,sky the
world around, and. lighting hearts
which will, to the, end bear, that hon-
ored mark, “Notre Dame.” ’

Pick Out 63 Species .
, Near. Campus
The number of birds that are in
the vicinity of the Notre Dame cam-
pus is hardly realized by the student
who knows birds. only by the fact
that some, are differently colored
than others, that some sing a differ-
ent song,, and that some peck ait tree
sides. Notre Dame ornithologists,
however, * know that there is an
unusual variety of-birds about
the
campus. / Brother .Alphonsus,. for

The Techno-Log
MORE LINES TO THE LOG.
The Log. is on trial. So far it has
been a gratifying success. It has a
plan for the remainder of the year
and a program for next year. It. is
attempting to make itself a more
useful and consequently a more ap-
preciated factor in Notre Dame life.
Success will,come only with the sup-
port and increased recognition: of
all the, students in engineering, sci-
ence and architecture.	.
If , we wish to do our part toward
making the DAILY a success,, we
must contribute news items. The
column cannot justify its existence
without the cooperation of the men
of our departments. The price of
success in this .case is hard, con-,
scientious work.	■
Now-the. point. .We do not hear
enough from the freshmen. They
are perhaps as good as any we have
seen at Notre Dame; but we feel
that since the men of ’26 will be
the sophomores of next year—and
we will need the help of each one of
them to carry out our program—
they can and must do. better .if our
plans are to mature to the fullest
extent. •<	•	,	': ■
We feel that there are capable
men who have .not yet sought .work
on the, paper; who have not contrib-
uted anything.. From our' experi-
ence we know that these men can
gain valuable training from uniting
with the DAILY. . '	...
We are grateful, for. the lines al-
ready thrown us. • We have no fear
of . sinking; but if the underclass-
men will come across more strong-
ly,‘the benefits will be mutual and
the University as well'as ourselves
will be the better for it. .	.

' On that occasion'it will indeed have much of which it may be proud.
The consistent .and healthy,growth that. has. continued since the' day
Alexis Coquillard, established his trading post among the Potawatomi
Indians? at the south bend of the St. Joseph River. has’made South
Bend one of the-most souikl industrial centers in the nation;
Within' q decade after* South Bend had received its char textile/,.

—fee	Bouth Bend Ilas'
/ J7;had" for its- nfflgKfipr^anreducationai-^institution which, has enjoyed,a
/ ' growth comparable' to its own. -Just as the city has taken -rank among.
/ .;the.leqding cities bf the Middle West, so has Notre Dame won'a place
/ among the universities.	-7
‘ • ' Sharing in this manner in the same happy: development, it, was to..
be expected-that the city, and the school,should have fostered, cordial
gelations with*one another. Both have ever been ready to;extend more
/ - than mere courtesy whenever one could’aid the other; And fortunately,
> . ■ as;the city and the university have grown this spirit has: also grown
stronger. -	.	/ .	’
In the drive for the endowment fund .which followed^ South Bend
expressed its loyalty to Notre Dame in no uncertain terms. The gener-
. ous ^contribution of its citizens Ayas 'most gratifying, not’ only for^ its
intrinsic worth, but -even more so . because it was concrete expression of
; . the friendly feeling toward-Notre. Dame.	■	" (
'South Bend advertisers have always aided'in making possible stu-
. . dent . publications; they will aid in making possible the publication of
> the‘Daily. We hope that South Bend will welcome the Daily, for
this newspaper.should be another link in the'chain of friendship .which
has been forged, between the- city/and--the University- .The Daily,-
therefore^ greets! South Bend as an old-friend; it rejoices with’the city
. in its achievements of a century and it trusts .'that in the ’future -it may
be a:medium for bringing the students and the people of South-Bend
into a still more thorough friendship.'	z

Poor Hooda. He simply could ,not
learn .the intricacies of; tripping the
wicked, sock.' -Try as -he ‘might he
never .seemed to^he able to set the
old . violins, down at the right mo-
ment.'. His partner’s feet seemed
always to-be under his. ’. His time
seemed to be rotten. ; In fact the
whole task seemed seamy. . 7.-
But 'one night he strolled out on
the veranda for a chew between
dances. He took a big chew, .threw
away the.bottle :and was just enter-
ing the'hall again when his ear was.
arrested by, voices. Some man'was
talking. ... They; were talking ■ about
the dance.; They were saying, “Ya,
the big ham: she don’t move her feet
fast enough. They’re all the time
under mine.” ' Another said, “Same
with'mine,'femme., I know I’m. all
right. It’s, her.” A third remarked,
“Mine too..;. Of- course . she - .won a
dancing prize , at school, and .every-
body says she’s .great,-but would
you believe it, slie can’t step it off
with mejat:all? : They’re- all alike.”
Hooda left. He went into the
hall and grabbed the first girl.. He
walked all over her. He kicked her
shins. He .galumped all over her,
toes. He butted into hei’ qose. He
stumbled, reeled, whirled,- fought,
scratched,'and bit. Then he walked
out onto the veranda again. Mak-
ing. his wa yto a group of men; he
lit a cigaret, stuck out his chest and
unlimbered, “Whata punk bunch of
dancers these. zgirls are. . Honest,
when they ain’t under your feet
they’re’ dragging themselves around
as though- they had the sleeping
sickness. • - Why they’re positively,
ah/,ah.’’i Hooda paused in search of
a ajective derogatory enough to un-
load, the vitriol within him; The
men cheered him. And then it was
that Hooda gave, a vast sigs of relief
and pleasure. Hooda had learned
to. danced
A RENAISSANCE
' .. :For . five years, a-Freshman Frolic has been impossible. The un-
../savory odor of a-Frolic of some years ago still lasted, for some freshmen
had been indiscreet; In their endeavor to express class spirit they had
' sacrificed everything on the altar of -democracy. They were extremely
’ -democratic and the music of the 'evening was the swanrsong of the
, ■ Frolics. . . ;	'	, 1	■.	.	’
.. • -But now the renaissance. Triday evening the freshmen congre-
- gated: in the Palais Royale and enjoyed one of the most successful
informals in the history of the. University. They made it not only a
.-financial-success, but a social success, as ,well. The three essentials
- zwere. present—happy youths, pretty girls, the occasion.
• The contrast of last night was pleasant. -
It was due, of course, to the men who staged the dance.' An import-
ant contributory reason may 'have been/the University’s changed policy
• of discipline, liberal, discipline through a competent agency,,and surely
one was the, activities of the Scholarship Club..	7 •
-: If any of .the-women of that , organization have felt unrequited for
/ their labor, a peek at Friday’s-Frolic, would have shown them a success-
ful affair, to>thc success of which they had contributed much. It is a
good thing to. provide the means for sending men through college,, but
’ -it is a better'thing to assist-in sending men through, college properly,
7 to assist in drawing out the estimable qualities' of many men. while pro-
viding means for a few. The Scholarship Club, has provided means for:
- making: proper acquaintances. Such work is-not only convivial; but good
sociology-as well. The University officials, have unloosed the .bonds
. that have held.the students from initiative. ,-Both organizations deserve
, the sincere thanks of the student body. ,	/	. '
With the privileges, come duties. With freedom comesi.responsi^
. bility. The Notre Dame man must see thaUthe" plentiful- social life of
the present does not again become-the famine .of .the past. ./Whether’
\ at does or not, rests with him.

-j ‘	(Ohio State Lantern)	.
' Critics of college education today
indicate/as one of its." major -faults
.the. tendency of students to do ,nb
more than; go to class with" a note-
book’ and' copy lectures by the in-
structor. They assert that the av-
erage ? student—and he ,is. many
thousands in .number—is 'little more
than a mechanical tool: he copies,
but never thinks for himself. Orig-
inality is declared .to be made im-
possible by this .process;'the product
of the process of education is mere-
ly a type which conforms to the:
mold of.the conventional.
Whether or not this criticism be
just, it must be admitted that stu-
dents generally depend too much on
the instructor. -: Everything is hand-
ed to them in a patent form—ideas,
formulas, principles, and doctrines.
Nothing is doubted except in rare1
instances. ■	.	'
' As James Harvey Robinson point-;
ed out in .his recent valuable book,"
most-of the ideas and doctrines of.
the present' generation have been-
inherited-from past centuries. We
of this day merely have the word,
of-people of other centuries that
many things are as they are, or are
at all. > We tend, merely to scratch
the surface of the most common-
’place things and .to swallow the
whole. As Professor Robinson 'ad-
vocates, a spirit, of. intellectual in-
dependence should be-aroused.
-Yale attains this end in part by,
means of the . Yale union, which af-
fords opportunity - for open discus-
sion, of matters of common import-
ance. - . Religion, • politics, science,
literature—all are' debated and dis-
cussed., Some, similar group on the
campus here-could' perform a. signal
service for the- University and the
students by promoting these discus-
sion ■ groups. < They - undoubtedly,
give a- rounded quality to a univer--
sity education. -	, "	/

Once in-a great while,, upon, the •' .

hears, the astonishing fact'that, all
college professors are failures! .
,In the eyes of these narrow-mind-
ed critics, then; it is mere -folly for
a man tp'work for-,higher special-
ization in educational,' literary and . ■

as a result, of ।his years df ’labor.
Why work: toward intellectual ad- . /-
vancement, and why train the mind
along the-highest, planes of endeav— : '
or,, since ,to do so. is to fail? - Why
put men in charge of educating the- -
youth of .our country who have fail- y r
ed in their own life work?
,.;To brand a college professor as a
failure is ridiculous and absurd to, :

Overcoming, a three run handicap
-.- In the first inning the heavy hitting
Brownson team defeated the fast
Freshman aggregation. Ryan was
Invincible except in the first inning,,
when by walks and wild pitches he
-. allowed three Frosh to score; Heavy
work with the stick by Dunn and
Ashe,, of Brownson, was responsible
for the majority of . the tallies. This
game places Brownson in undisput-
ed possession of first place.
Dwyer, of Freshman, was unable
to ■ twirl successfully against the
hard-hitting Brownsonites. Sweeney
who did the back-stopping, caught
•a good game and. showed a good arm
for pegging. ' Tatham, who drew
the left garden' assignment, made
some spectacular catches. Cullinan,

EAST OR WEST? ’ -
■ It is' interesting, to note :how, the
co-eds in the various localities dif-
fer.in their customs. ■ The eastern
girls;, of - Radcliff College, from Joe
Burke, Jack Adams, Spike McAdams
and Jack' Sheehan’s- territory boast
that they-are not flappers, and that
they; do/not use rouge or .powder
their noses during class/ • The west-
ern girls of. Iowa University, from
Judge Carberry, Tubby . Harrington
and Chuck / Casey’s district,, • boast
that on -an1 average they.spend .only
45;. minutes a day -improving their
looks. ■ Now < figuring that ; these
western: girls start primping, at the
age ;of ,15 -and continue to do so
until they are 70, we compute that
the time- spent would- be equal to a
year^and; nine months of their lives.-
