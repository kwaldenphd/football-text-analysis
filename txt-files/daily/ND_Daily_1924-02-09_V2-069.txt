Laid—ieeees and Gen—tie—
men!!
The , extraordinary Cotillion is
over! A most laudable and praise-
worthy display of dazzling inagni-
ficance and superlative splendor it
was! You have now satisfied the
demands of Terpsichore, and now,
]aidJ_ieess'and gentle—men, let us
turn, not from the sublime to the
ridiculous but from the sublime to
the sartorial, and let me have your
attention for just a few brief mo-
ments, th^.t you may not leave'this
tent without seeing once and for
al], and for the last time, the final
act in the*little play that has been
going on in this colhmm for the
past three weeks. . It is pos-it-ively,
laid—iees and gentle—men, your
last opportunity—do not crowd,
there is plenty of room-—step back
please, this is a frail platform. ....
-o- -o-
You have observed, my friends,
the struggle the past week—you
have seen Ryan and Moore and
Stuhldreher: and' Thode and Ken-
nedy, one after the other seize the
palm of victory only to lose it to
some flashier competitor — you
have watched the bitter race be-
tween. Ryan and Moore, and. you
have read their propaganda. _ You
have seen halt line up against hall,
and rector against rector—aye!
brother against brother in this
struggle, and then—laid—iess and
gentle—men, you have seen out of
the East a star . flash dimly for a
second, and then rise, meteoric,
like a,golden arrow; and sweep
through the constellations (and to
the consternation)—of ./.Ryan. /and
Moore, and the rest, and burstL-a
dazzling and unparalleled phenome-
non of splendor into first place and
victory. And who, laid—dees and'
gentlemen was this star out of the
East? ' Who? Who else than the
man whose name was announced
on Thursday as the winner of the
contest for the best-dressed man at
Notre Dame ; . . no other than
FRANK MILBAUER.
-o- -o- .
AND to-day, Saturday, laid—iees
and gentlemen, the award will be
made. A hockey game. will be
.played on our snowy ice today.
Frank Milbauer, attired in his best,
,m the robes of Solomon, which have
'von him this honor and glory—
Frank - Milbauer will, be awarded
the cup which has been, promised
the winner of this contest.’ The
CUP rests in the editor-in-chief’s
j suite of rooms in Walsh hall, care-
tully guarded by Scouts-Eg-L-I and
Nab-M. The engraving on this cup
Was completd at a late hour yester-
day,'and was polished after work-
ing hours by two experts from the
Jewelry houses of Clauer and Mary
mour nearby city. The cup stands
Wo feet high, and is of hammered
■material.	.	/

TODAY, then my friends—and—
as an added attraction to' this re-
markable presentation, and in or-
er that no aspersion, detraction or
raducement will be connected with
^.presentation, the cup will be
yarded in person—-“personal”—
J no less a distinguished person-
than Mr. Grundy himself—-per-
°ual! He will be there! . Even as
,e Was at the Cotillion last even-
unknown to the hundreds who
are there. Mr. Grundy will .be at

ent and “obvious” to the. thou-
nds who will undoubtedly attend

TRACK MEN TO RUN
IN WESTERN MEET
Contest to Be Held at; Kansas City
Today; Basketball Team to
Meet Concordia College,.
Coach Rockne and a squad of ten-
men left South Bend at 2:50 yes-
terday afternoon for Kansas City
where Notre Danie will be seen in
action today, at the Kansas City
Athletic club invitation track meet.
Rockne has entered a mile and two
mile relay team in a large field of
starters composing the cream, of the
Missouri Valley track talent. The
mile relay composed of Barr, Ham-
ling, McTeirnan and .Eaton, will
face one of the fastest fields in the
country when theiy line up with the
color bearers of Nebraska, Drake,
Ames, Missouri, and the. Kansas
Aggies. The . two-mile team, made
up of Captain Kennedy, Barber,
Cox, and O’Hare, will meet com-
petition equally as keen as that en-
tered in the mile relay event from
the same group of colleges.
Elmer Layden will toe the mark in
a special 50-yard dash in the Kan-
sas City meet. Adam Walsh is also
entered - in a special 50-yard high
hurdle event. .
The Notre Dame colors, although
not. positively able to compete in
the 'meet Tahy gfeat~~degree ~or“su/
periority, will nevertheless be
among the high scorers. Layden
undoubtedly will be able to hold his
own against the Missouri Valley
speed merchants. With two such
sterling runners as Kennedy . and
Cox in the half mile, the Irish col-
ors should place' well up in the
money at the. finish of the two-mile
relay.,
Coach Keogan and a squad of
ten men will invade Fort Wayne
about noon today and will line up
against the Concordia . College
quintet on the South Side gym floor
tonight. The Concordians are
looked upon as anything but an
easy .. aggregation and the Irish
courtmen will have to be in smart
form in -order to hold their own
against the theological students .
The Irish eagers/experienced a
rather bad night when they took
on the Wabash five, but the ups and
downs of the court game may set
the Irish up in whirlwind fashion
tonight. Two hard games follow on

TRAINING FOR BOY
W0RKERSJN1TIATED
University Offers New Course to
Prepare Experts; Knights of ;
Columbus Are Sponsors.
With the opening of the spring
semester, February, 1924, the Uni-
versity of Notre Dame initiated a
new movement in Catholic educa-
tion providing for the professional
training of experts in the free-time
guidance of boys. The Knights of
Columbus has established .30 schol-
arships, extending over a period of
two pears, which provi<Le<the~first
group of students for the new
course. These will be selected by
the recently established Boy Life
Bureau of the Knights, in consulta-
tion with experienced boy workers
throughout the. country.
Mr. Hoyer, Ka graduate, of Penn-
sylvania University, and for some
years past -a member and profes-
sional worker of the Boys’ Club
Federation, ■ has been secured ' to
provide the professional training of
the course, which is under the’di-
rection of the Department of Edu-
cation, assisted by the Physical Ed-
ucation Department. .South' Bend
will be the laboratory for the ap-
prenticeship phase of the training
during the school year, and during
the - summer the various boys’
camps conducted by the Boys’ Club
Federation and other agencies.
Brother Barnabas; F. C. S., is
director of the new’Boy Life Bu-
reau of the Knights of Columbus,

N.D. HOCKEY TEAM
TO MEETMICHIGAN
Irish Have Chance io Win this Aft-
eroon; Ice is in Good Condi-
tion for Fast Work.
The only home attraction of this
week-end will be the hockey game
on St. Mary’s lake this afternoon.
The Irish puck team will meet the
fast Michigan sextet at 1:30
o’clock, and from all indication this
will be the hockey classip. of the
season 'for the local fans.
Notre Dame met the Wolverines
in a season opener at Ann Arbor
in January and was defeated, 2-1,
after having held the’clever Michi-
gan team in check for three peri-
ods.	i-
The game this afternoon -will be
a hard, fast contest and a case
where the sextet with the smoother
working team work will ultimately
be victorious.- The Trish have more
than a fighting chance and are con-
fident of victory.
The! visitors.. displayed a good
knowledge of the game in the first
meeting of the season and have de-
veloped a splendid offense and de-
fense which will tax the resources
of the Irish team this afternoon.
As the game being, played under
the; freshmen—ruling,- -the—Notre
Dame.yearling'ice stars will be un-
able to show their wares against the
Michigan school.
The ice is in the best condition
it has been all season and the
game should be lightning fast.
The starting line-up for the pro-
teges of Tom Lieb will be Jimmy
Egan at the goal, Mouch and Tim-
mins on defense, Captain McSorley
at center, and the Stack-Irmager
duo at the forwards. Norm Felts
will not be able to get into the
game because of a recent illness.
Juniors' A rrange to
Purchase Class Pins
Pins for the Junior class will
cost $15.50 and will be purchased
from the L. G. Balfour Company at
Attleboro, Mass. This announce-
ment was made at a meeting of the
class Wednesday afternoon. - The
pins of last year were purchased
from the same firm. Part payments
may be made at any time to-John
Traynor, but full payment' must be
made by May 1.
Tickets for the Junior Prom will
be placed on sale February 15, and
will sell for, $10. It is planned by
the class committee to serve a sup-
per from 12 to 1:30 o’clock on the
mezzanine floor of the Palais Roy-
ale on the night of the dance. An
additional charge of $2.50" will be
asked for this privilege..
Students desiring to purchase
Junior cartoon books may obtain
them at room 123, Corby. Only a
few remain unsold.
METROPOLITAN CLUB MEETS
A financial statement was read at
a meeting of the Metropolitan club
Tuesday night. Plans for the S.
A. C. carnival, were discussed, and
a dance to be held in South Bend
in the Easter vacation was sug-
gested. . Definite plans for the
dance were left for the next meet-
ing.'	'
PROF. NEWMAN TO SPEAK
Professor Newman, who appeared
in Washington^ hall last year, will
lecture this year on South America.
Those who remember Mr. News-
man’s lectures last; year ’.will not
miss the opportunity to hear him.
From the first soft symphony of
Benson’s Collegiajns ’till the last
rose light was extinguished, the
Sophomore Cotillion held last night
at the Palais Royale presented a
colorful spectacle seldom, if ever,
equalled in Notre Dame social af-
fairs. More than 250 couples at-
tended the formal. Dancing con-
tinued untilv2 o’clock.
Favors for the ladies were tiny
silver * perfumettes monogramed
with . an “N. D.” Unusually at-
tractive programs were included
with the dance.
..The orchestra, "Benson’s Colleg-
ians of Chicago, played remarkably
entertaining music, and inter-
spersed the regular dance numbers
with novelties of their own.
Many out-of-town guests attend-
ed the dance and added greatly to
the general success of the social
side. Besides the large number of
sophomores at the dance, many up-‘
per classmen attended what is said
to have been the best Cotillion ever
given at Notre Dame.
The usual flashlight picture was
taken in order that proper history
might be kept. The prevailing col-
or scheme of the decorations was z
the familiar soft red and. blue light-
ing effects of the Palais Royale.
Patrons and patronesses included
Mr. and Mrs. William Benitz, Mr.
and Mrs. James Reichert, Mr. and
Mrs. David Weir, Prof. James Mc-
Carthy, and Prof. Paul Fenlon.
. The success of the. dance was. due -
mainly? to "'-the'" efforts 'of-^ Mai*k
Mooney, president of the-class, An-
drew F. Colin, vice-president, '■
Francis A. ’ McGuigan, .and the
treasurer, Stanley J. Walsh.
Committees in charge .of the Co-
tillion were:
Finance—Stanley Walsh,' chair- y
man; Bernard Wingerter, .Frank
Walsh, Thomas Leahy, Robert

ward T. O’Neill.

Bowlers Urged

“Every bowler in the University

ment. We want to make the con-
test a big success and we want to

BUSINESS STAFF
Birds dwell in nests, foxes in
holes, but men must have houses.
A bird’s nest is at the same time its
home. Likewise, foxes draw no
fine distinctions between their hill-'
side dug-outs • and their country
domiciles. : But a man’s dwelling
place, even though he have but one,
is not necessarily a home. For the
animal, a home means little more
than a shelter against the weather,
a refuge from pursuit, a place of
safety in which to rear its young.
Consequently it makes little dif-
ference whether we refer to such
places as homes or holes, nests or
lairs.	• ■
a building. It can be replaced.
Wreck a home, and you destroy a
family, ruin happiness, blast hopes,
snuff out opportunities, wound a
nation in a vital spot. Wreck a
million homes in any nation and its
very life is endangered. Wreck a;
million houses,, and you would4
scarcely cause a ripple on-the out-
ward surface of national life. Even;
here the body is . more than the
raiment.

WISDOM ON COLLEGES AND YOUTHS
.Thomas R. Marshall, former• vice-president of the United States,
who is now a practicing-attorney in Indianapolis, yesterday granted an
interview that was filled with wisdom. We print those parts of the
interview that are most striking. If your Cotillion dates are taking
too much of-your time to allow you to read all he says, skip to the last
paragraph. Don’t miss that. ■
“Miich complaint is being' uttered on all hands about the conduct
of the young. I don’t know that it’s any worse than the conduct of the
young of my day, only different. 'But if there'be any wrong, it is not
viciousnessl It is lack of painstaking education starting in the home,
followed up in the school and rounded out in some old-fashioned college.
“It must be perfectly apparent to every man that the really im-
portant thing in life is education. The effect of training on individual,
economic, and political life is all-compelling. What you put into the
young nfan’s mind, if it be the wrong thing, will inevitably come out
in after life.	. .	:	?
“Now,-1 don’t pretend to. speak about what ought to be, because
I am myself a victim of the educational methods of Wabash College. , It
may be that the old order .in/the republic ought to be overthrown;. it
may be that the only-warning in the business world should be the grarid
jury; it may be that there should be no distinction between liberty and
license,’ but’there isn’t anybody, in the world that could convince me
of the truth of these things nor change my views.
“I was trained to believe in progress, but was told to proceed in
the middle of the’road. Consequently, I have no patience with either
the despot or the demagogue. I was trained to believe that in the
business affairs of life I ought to be an autocratic citizen, that my
machinery ought to. run in accordance, with the moral code instead of
being started" by legislative cranks.. I was taught to think that the
worst law was infinitely better than the wisest mob—in other words, I
was taught to believe that the unit of . society, of business and of the
state was the individual and that,, therefore,’the proper conception by
the individual of the rights, and the corresponding duties to society
was of. the very highest moment. I was also taught milk was for
•babies and meat for strong’riien.	. ;	;	.
. -• ., “I have no protest to make against any theory being discussed in
the republic, a bit more than I .have as to; a controversy between the
' old-fashioned razor and the modern safety, but I believe that judgment
is .the last function of the human intellect that matures, and I think it
very dangerous to permit immature young men'to Settle many of the
vexing problems in religion, politics and business before their judg-
. ment matures. _	.	. ..
. \ “The university, if it is to justify its name,'is. to be a place where
all contending theories of life may be, very freely discussed, because the
/ idea of the university is that it is; the meeting place of mature minds.
I believe, therefore, in the old-fashioned cultural, college, which tries to
train young men to high thinking and right living, but is unwilling to
permit them to indiscriminately study; all of the fads or fancies, what-
ever they may be, while their judgments/and their wills are riot as yet
fully matured.” ■	' // y -
For man, a home is more than a
shelter, or a residence, more than a
nursery or a club. It .is a kingdom
and a palace, a sanctuary, an earth-
ly paradise. It is not made so much
of brick arid mortar, of walls and
roof, as of love and loyalty, of
spirit arid of life. It is/not due so
much to the conceptions bf the
architect or the handicraft of the
artisan, as it is to the size of the
family and the temper and temper-
aments, the tastes and intelligence
of its members. Money and ma-
terials produce the house. ; A home
is a house which shelters a well-
regulated primal society of sev-
erally affectionate human beings.
Many nations, our own among
them, need houses. More of them,
and especially our own, need homes.
Just recently we- read this an-
nouncement: “Wanted—a Million
Homes.” But wjiat.it really meant
.was a million houses, a million
roofs, to shelter the destitute'.
Houses of course are necessary, but
homes are more.necessary. // A mil-
lion houses would- add not a little
to the tangible wealth of a nation.
A million real; homes would add
enormously to the health and pow-.
er, the dignity and worth, of a na-
tion.
:Wreck a house, and .you: destroy
We agree with Mr. Gox that the fruits of isolation bring the farmer
no profits. -- ----	-	.	..
Our idea of the impossible is the telling of a barc-faced'lie by an
anarchist. ..
If the modern college man learned a new word as often as he
chalked his cue, he would be a worthy rival of the famed Mr. Webster;
And if the. efforts of average college men were pooled the result
would;be a new pool champion.

Criminal house wrecking is not
common. It is sufficiently rare to
be ‘/news.’’. Criminal home wreck-
ing is almost epidemic. It has ceas-
ed to horrify, because it has be-
come; so common as to be expected,
and accepted,—as inevitable, if not
yet wholly excusable. As a nation
it is quite possible we are building
a million houses. In our nation it
is -atleast -equally probable that
divorce and the crimes that, lead to
it have wrecked more than a mil-
lion homes. How many lives they
may have wrecked is another ques-.
tion. We leave it to your consid-
eration. ' ’

Many men have houses, but they
make their homes — such as they
are—elsewhere. /They go where
“no children are allowed” because
they /have, ‘ and will have none: of
their own. They do riot need;
houses; they, do need homes. . In-
deedj they need to be taught what
a home means, and - they would
mean to them and to society. " But
that in turn Avould-require instruc-
tion in the true religion. For in
that alone can be founds the secret
of- happiness, of that right order of-

In this collection of “theatrical
theories”^ Brander^ Mathews-, suc-
ceeds^ in expressing his views of-the
drama very7 well, and is particular-
ly successful . in = recalling interest-
ing memories of actors of .other
days. In fact the most interesting
chapter-of the collection, rin our es-
timation, is the delightfully familiar
essay, “Memories of Actors.”; Ed-
win Booth, John Philip Kemble;
John T. Raymond and others are
recalled, bythis man .who knew them
all intimately when they were at
the height of their power.
Brander Mathews believes, right-
ly, that the laws of the drama are
unchanged . a nd .. unchangeable.
There are certain, conventions, of
the drama which can-never .be dis-
pensed with; however, literature in
all ies forms is confined by certain
conventions, so the; development of
the drama is not hampered by these
restrictions; rather, it is guided and
led by them to its-true heights.

Jargon
Jargon is the use of abstract, in-
stead of ^definite, words.' It is ex-
tensively used by a great number of
our modern writers. The “jargon-
ists”' are sometimes found among
the very men ‘whom - wehave
learned to revere as capable auth-
ors.	’	- . - -
The principle evils of jargon.are:
first, circumlocution/ or talking
around the • subject, instead of
straight, concise diction; .second,
the use - of vague- abstract, nouns
rather than'concrete nouns. These
faults which characterize the use of
jargon-can only be overcome by get-
ting back to the normalcy of. our
language - and using plain; clear-cut
English. It is a virtue of English,
that it .is possible1 to use the/active
verb and; concrete noun in most in-
stances; By doing so we will evade
the dangerous habit of jargon.
The - “jargonist”- refuses - to use
one word several times in the same
passage. If-a sentence reads, “rain
caused the postponement of the
football game,” the same thought
will probably be repeated a few
lines below as, “adverse climatic
conditions necessitated the curtail-
ment of the proposed contest!” ' / ;
The “jargonist” is afraid to usd
the same1 word more than once no
matter how good a word it may.be.
But we have only to'refer'to some
of the greatest writers of- the world
to see how foolish .this principle is.
Shakespeare is never timid about
repeating a strong arid vivid word.
Neither is St. John in . this great
piece of literature that is. read ev-

Father Foik Gets
।	Interesting Book
An interesting book in Latin, 407
years old, has been secured for the
■ library by Father Paul Foik. The
i book a commentary on' Plato, was
written by Cardinal Bassarionis,
patriarch of Constantinople, and
was painted “in Venis in the house
of Aldus and his companion in the
month of September, A. D. 1517.”
It ■ also contains a- translation from
Greek to Latin of Aristotle’s four-
teen books., of metaphysics. The
volume was: purchased in .London
for 18. shillings. .	.
The. book is bound in soft velum
and is in a remarkable state of
L' preservation. The usual title page
is supplanted by a colophon at the
end. On the first and last pages is
found the emblem of the publisher,
. a dolphin and anchor. The pages
are exceptionally clean and white
and the printing very clear.
“One would think,” said Father
Foik, “when he examines the pages
; • . of this book and' compares them
< with the pages of books found in
the reference room of out library
that we have degenerated from the
J time of Cardinal Bassarionis in the
1 matter of cleanliness. - ,
. v “Next month we intend to have
an-exhibit in the, library for -the
edification of -Enemies of-Books’.”
Blue Circle Plans
Act for Carnival
c Plans for the presenting of an act
to be given by the Blue Circle as a
part of the Irish Carnival, to be held
; during Lent under the auspices of
the S. A. C., were discussed -at a
meeting, of that organization, yester-
day noon in .the library.
This body, to which the privilege
of presenting the last act has been
granted, intends to produce, a bur-
? .lesque act. It has been definitely
decided that members of the Blue
Circle, who participate in other acts
' on the program, may perform in the
: interest, of that group.	' .
; It is requested that members of
the Blue Circle having suggestions
to make'in regard to the presents
ing of the act, please cummunicate
1 With Matt Rothert, chairman of the
committee. Other members of the
'committee are: Harold F. Thomp-
. son, Jack Barr, John A. Elliott,
Ralph F. Heger, Jack Adams, Tom
O’Connor and.Paul De Paolis.
‘6 Terry9 9 is Pleased
With His New Name
“Terry,” the new Irish mascot,
was . interviewed yesterday after-
noon about his new name.
When the cub reporter
the “kennel” where our
makes his abode, a smile
come spread over the
entered
“Terry”
of wel-
puppy’s
countenance, and he greeted the re-
porter with a cheery bark.
At first the interviewer was con-
fused because interviewing such a
celebrity was new to him; but
“Terry” soon put him*at ease. In
reply to the question, “How do you
like your name?” he again smiled
as only a terrier can smile and
said, “I like it-very much, and I
am sure that all dogdom envies me,
my name and position.”
The reporter then questioned
him regarding the prospects of the
coming football season and for a
third time he smiled? “I can hard-
ly wait until fall to see the team in
action against Army and Princeton.
The Nebraska game fills me with
thrills. How proud I shall feel
when our boys march off the field
victors! The sting of past defeats
will be wiped away and-------”
. At this point we were interrupt-
ed by the master of the kennel,
who announced that “Terry” would
have to go out in the gym as Rock
would like to see him with regard to
the plan of attack against West
Point.	'
Thus “Terry’s” first interview
was cut short, and anything further
that he may have had in mind is
left to the reader’s imagination.

Editor of The- DAILY:
I am sorry, and I apologize sin-
cerely and humbly, if my recent let-
ter has insulted the Law School
body. I say, heartily, lawyers, that
there was not and is not such a
thought in my mind. Apparently
my words have conveyed a meaning
different than intended.
My first point was not cribbing
in itself, not, by any means, that
cribbing in the Law Schools is
.more common than in the other
Notre Dame schools; that the per-
sons, overheard in the street car,
were lawyers I did not consider at
all an indictment of the Law
School. I am glad to hear from
Mr. Stanton that Hoynes College is
comparatively free from cribbing.
I did wish to express my disgust
that they of Notre Dame should so
lower the estimation of their Uni-
versity; that was my point. I do
not know the names of these per-
sons nor did I see them sufficiently
to recognize them again.
Sincerely,
Z. R.

Boston Authority
Praises Library
The Notre Dame library ranks
with the best, and has progressed
more rapidly than any Catholic li-
brary in the country. This is the
opinion of the Rev. William M.
Stinson, S. J., of Boston College,
who visited the University yester-
day afternoon.
Boston College is going to build
a new library to cost approximately
$600,000. Father Stinson has,in-
spected and made inventories ‘of
book stacks of many universities
throughout the country, so that the
new Boston College library will be
the embodiment of the latest li-
brary facilities.
Some of the libraries Father
Stinson has visited are the Congres-
sional library, the libraries at Cath-
olic University, Harvard, and Mich-
igan.
Four Teams Tie
in Relay Races
As a result of the interhall relays
held in the gym Thursday, Carroll,
Sophomore, Freshman and Corby
are in a tie for first place with two
victories each' and no defeats.
Brownson and Walsh are in second,
each having won and lost one race,
while Badin, Day, Sorin, and Cadil-
lac are in last place with two de-
feats.
The record of 1:38, which was
registered by the . Carroll sprinters
during the first meet, was lowered
to 1:37 3-5 Thursday, Sophomore
and Corby both making the mark.
Carroll was close behind with
1:37 4-5.	.	• • •
The teams all showed marked
improvement in getting off to a
faster start and ' also setting a
speedier pace, probably due to the
fact that they were more familiar

INTERHALL EAGERS
TO MEET SUNDAY
Several Fast Games Expected;
Badin Defeats Corby, Going
Into Tie for Third Place.
From all appearances the five in-
terhall basketball games to be
played in the gym tomorrow will
be the- fastest that have thus far
been staged. Day and Sorin, who
are in a deadlock for second place,
will put up a real battle when they
meet on the court tomorrow. Both
teams have showed much class in
the games they have played and
it is fiard to pick a favorite between
them..
The game between the pace set-
- ting Carroll team and the Sopho-
more crew will be another attrac-
tion on the schedule. The Soph
tossers have been displaying good
form as the season has progressed
and the top notchers will be forced
to go the limit if they are to keep
their record perfect.
The Brownson-Walsh battle also
ranks high on the Sunday schedule.
Both teams are tied in fourth place,
and will battle to the limit to boost
their standing. Besides the above
mentioned games the the Cadillac
and Corby game and' also the con-
test between Badin and Freshman
promise to be exceptionally good,
as the schedule is ,drawing to a
close and the teams, will fight to
reach the top.	*
In playing off a postponed game,
the Badin ringers won over the
Corby squad, 30 to 13. The game,
however, was closer, than the score
* indicates. As a result Badin went
into a tie with Sophomore and Cad-
illac for third place, while the Cor-
by quintet dropped into last place
with Brownson, Freshman and
Walsh.
Games will be played tomorrow
' as follows:	' . ,

THE RUB DOWN
By TOM COMAN
The University of Michigan har-
bors a brilliant track performer
within its walls, who having filled
out his years of eligibility, will try
out for the American Olympic track
team this spring. Keene Fitzpat-
rick, the Princeton track coach and
former Wolverine mentor says that! but the Bohemian flash says he has
H. B. Hoffman, holder of the na-
tional A. A. U. title, is the greatest
student of javelin throwing in the
country. . .
Hoffman is a small man, weigh-
ing only 160 pounds and stands 5
feet 3 inches in height, bat studies
the “reed-throwing art” with the
same seriousness that marks . his
work in the Michigan medical
school. He'.studies, every move?-
ment required in the throw and
often takes a work out before a
large mirror than he might easier
discern what his form lacks in the
way of perfection.
Hoffman prefers the American
style of the “snap back” Finland
style, and gets off his throws with
an ease and grace. His peg in the
A. A. U. last summer registered 194
feet 7% inches. Hoffman hopes to
make it 200 feet before the
pic trials.

It will be a great many

'A football team with a record
similar to that would be the biggest
drawing card the sporting world
has ever known.
There is a sparkling jewel dwell-
ing in the sport sphere of an Iowa
city about this time upon which, the
eyes of many of the country’s big-
gest universities are feasting with
a covetous delight. It is none other
than the phenomenal high school
halfback,' Elmer Marek, the man
whose prep school playing.has elec-
trified thousands ~of the"’country’s
gridiron fans.
Marek, the great Bohemian flash,
completes,his career of high school
eligibility this month and from all
reports he has not yet chosen the
college at which he will continue
his gridiron, cinder path and bas-
ketball .exploits. Marek was the
big cog. in the Cedar Rapids foot-’
ball-machine .which has for three
years been one of the out-standing
moleskin squads in prep sport cir-
cles. ’	'
Marek has'been acclaimed the
greatest all-time prep, school half-
back that the. country has ever
known,; and those- who know him
most intimately prophesy’ that his
college career will be one .sensa-
tional triumph after another. Be-
ginning at the bottom, Marek grad-
ually developed into the most ver-
satile halfback the middle west has
ever seen. < As a ball runner he has
no equal in prep circles, and with
Marek carrying the oval, the oppo-
sition fairly quailed before him, so
formidable had become this grid-
iron hero. .

Cedar Rapids went down to defeat,

Marek to come through with a grin

The American hockey
bowed to their Canadian neighbors
in the final of^the Olympic hockey
games .to the score of 6-1. The
•hundreds of thousands that jammed
every available space to ^ee the
game witnessed one of the roughest
battles that has been seen so far in
the Olympic games. The Europeans
seemed to glory in the wild sport
as it appeared to them, and every
time a player* hit the ice, a wild
che6r greeted the action. Blood
was spilled right and left and every
few seconds a member of either one
or the other would be sent off the
ice.
The team work of the Canadians
was the deciding factor of the en-
counter, while the individual stel-
lar work of the Americans failed to
stem the clever shooting of the Ca-
nadians.
According to the way the score
now stands, the Norwegians seem
certain of winning the winter sport
program. The nations in the first
six places include in their order;
Norway, Finland, Austria, United
States, Sweden and Great Britain.
Iowa, with the loss of two of her
players, gave up the ghost of a
conference basketball game to the
Maroons in easy fashion last Sat-
urday night in the Iowa camp to
the score of 31-18. The Maroon’s
win put them on equal footing with
the Michigan five for first place in
conference title race.

Jimmy Barry, one of the greatest
little fighters that ever donned the
gloves, and the only: bantamweight
champion of the world to ever re-
tire undefeated, is a notable exam-
ple of past unfortunates. Barry
constantly brooded over the death
of his English opponent, who died
the day following the fight. The
lingering grief hastened Barry’s re?
tirement.
Jess Willard fought Bill Young
and scored a K. O. The fighter
died the day after. But Willard
did not change. He improved and
soon afterward took on the title.
Taylor’s closer associates claim
that . Bud will not let the unfortu-
nate incident drive him from the
roped arena and instead asks for all
the fights his manager can get him.
“Brick” Muller, California end
who was name4 all-American in
1921, is of the opinion that the
long forward pass will follow in
the trail of the saloons and the
hobble skirt. Muller says •‘that
many coaches have given up the
long pass because they feel that
the chances of success are not great
enough to take the risk. Muller
himself was the greatest long pass
hurler that the game ever knew.
The Haskell Indians were also pop-
ular exponent of. the lengthy

Motion pictures of the Fourth
National Convention of the Cath-
olic Students’ Mission Crusade, held
at Notre Dame last’ summer, were
shown before the St. Mary’s units
of that organization, in St. Angela’s
hall, ;Thursday evening, ‘Decent-
ber 6.
Rev. Hugh O’Donnell,. C. S. C.,
director general -of the local or-
ganization, explained the pictures
and gave a short, history of the
work of the Crusade. Father O’Don-
nel congratulated the St. Mary’s
students on the organization of the
In-Di-A . and the Sacred Heart
units, and encouraged them in their
work. ' ‘	■ • - .
The film was of great interest to
the St. Mary’s students because it
gives an idea of the enormous
membership of the C. S. M. C., and
of the vast scope of its work.* An
opportunity was also afforded of
seeing some of the faculty and the
students in the “movies.”—St.
Mary’s Chimes.
