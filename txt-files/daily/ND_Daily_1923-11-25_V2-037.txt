NOTRE DAME WINS
FROM SKIBOS; 26-0
Irish Backfield Runs Wild On Forbes
Field; Connell Scores Twice In Long
Runs; Tartans Dazzled With Speed
FORBES FIELD, PITTSBURG, November 24-—When the Irish met
the Scotch in the battle of Pittsburg, on Forbes field yesterday afterhodri,/
the. whole world'knew that Rockne was back in the East again, as the ..
Micks rolled up 26 points, allowing the Tartans nothing more than a
fleeting glimpse of the Irish goal.	'	-
Carnegie Tech, after waiting for two weeks to meet Notre Dame
on the Pittsburg battle ground, was given a wonderful exhibition of foot-
ball as only the Rockmen can play it, but it can never be said that Coach
Steffen’s men did not fight to the-last ditch and then some.
Connell ,Crowley, Layden and Bergman constituted. a beautiful
ground-gaining quartet for Notre Dame, with Connell making two touch-
downs and'paving the way for: another. Layden and Maher each con-;
tributed a tally to the score books... Doc Connell, who struck his stride
in the>Butler game, exploited everything he had in reserve for the bene/
fit of Pittsburg, yesterday afternoon.
Carnegie Tech, boasting of a pair of scintillating backfield perform-
ers iri Captain Jimmy Robertson at -----------—
;and a touchdown. It was typical
Notre Dame football, bordering on
a track meet, and the interference
was marvelous.
Notre Dame punted after losing
eight- yards on. a fumble: and the
speedy Robertson made a wonderful
return of 25 yards.. Carnegie fre-
quently exhibited flashes of, the
speed and moleskin wit that has
■^pde them a'prominent aggregation
in eastern football circles. The’
Tartans-were* playing desperately
in the face of overwhelming odds:
with but on object in view—to hold
►the. Irish .tova-low/seore^	/»? - -
After an exchange of punts, Con-
nell ; agairi rode around the Tech
team on a bolt of lightning and
was finally downed after covering '
27 yards.	, \
, - The period, was played, out with
no exceptional flashes save for the;
charge of Brumbaugh through the.
Irish lirie for 15 yards and. a first/ 1
down, and the intercepting of Rob-;
ertson’s pass by Walsh just before
the half ended.	.	.
. Thie : kickoff for the. second1 half
was marked by Robertson’s second ,
sensational; return of a . kick since
the game started. This time, the
diminutive star picked up 27 yards,
and Brumbaugh/ followed his ex-
ample with a • plunge through - the .
line for 20 yards. Carnegie-was .
again approaching the Hoosiers’ .
goal, but Layden speared arpass
from Robertson and punted out of
danger. Within .a few minutes,
Notre Dame regained tha ball arid
Layden arid Crowley, with the aid.
of Stuhldreher, and Connell, pre-’
sented the “Charge of the Light
Brigade” and plowed: up/the field .
for 71 yards before sending Connell- a
over the line for a third touchdown?
The scoring: play smacked of the
spectacular'as' Connell fumbled the,
.pass from center but turned,
scooped up the bouncing pigskin,
reversed : his course.. and romped
around the’ right flank for the tally;
.Layden missed the goal, but Notre
Dame now had a 20rpoint lead on
the Tartans and.with another per-
iod. remaining, , prospects' looked
dark for,the Skibos who,had hoped
and fought to hold the Hoosiers to
a low score.	• . /
The Irish backfield opened the (
last period with a 40-yard advance
in five plays, for, which Crowley -
arid Bergman contributed 13/and
11 yards respectively. Notre Dame .
completed the first pass, which Iwas
good for-17 yards, and after an ex-
[change of punts the Irish were giv-
en a set back.of 30 yards for hold-
'irig on two occasions; but it had lit-
tle effect on the game, since Berg-.
; man (.intercepted. a .pass; and the’
, Hoosiers; began their last parade as
‘ a farewell performance for the East
’ ’ that had entertained, Rockne’s team

gan to burn up the sod with speed
and iri three more plays landed the
ball on Notre Dame’s 10-yard line.
1 After an exchange of punts, the
Rockmeri begaji their first parade
which stretched out for 70 yards
and featured .the running; of Con-
nell, who reeled off 37. yards. After
watching Layden, Crowley and
Stuhldreher pile up 15 yards more,
^Connell came, back for. ;20 yards,
placing the oval on Tech’s 2-yard
linei Layden drove over the line
for the first counter..
With the. exception oi the one in-
stanice -when the Skibos carried the
ball’ to the Notre Dqme 10-yard
line,' Steffen’s ~ men enjoyed no
great amount '.of -success in trying
to sinash the Irish defense, and sev-
eral times the Tartan backs. were
dumped for : a . loss. The Notre
Dame . defense was of more than
the .“stonewall variety,” as may be
seen: from the fact that after the
opening, kick-off,. Carnegie ; was
spilled for a loss of seven yards on
the first two plays, and they punted
to the', Irish rather than be carried
back over their own- goal line.
: Robertson printed to Stuhldreher
on the first play of the second quar-
ter and after Layden had recovered
the. ball, which had 'been fumbled
on. Notre - Dame’s- 2 0-yard line, the
• Skibos were penalized half the dis-
tance. to the; goal, which gave the
Irish the balllon Carnegie's 40-yard
line. For the,’ third ;time since the
game started Connell; uncorked a
scintillating .run and raced through
the entire Tech team for 41) yards

READING. IN BED
.Night lights have been granted to almost all the students oh the
. campus this year. An important and almost expected accompaniment
to night lights should be the practice of reading in. bed. Going to bed,
in. itself, Christopher Morley says, is always‘accompanied by a sigh of
resignation., It is, he further avows one of the' two things he dislikes
doing every day, the other being the practice of getting up in the morn-
ing. No one desires to go to bed, and the student, is especially adverse
to this imposition. For him, the night hours are sacred—hours to be
' spent in “heart affluence in discursive talk," to be whiled away smok-
ing andibrowsirig over an old book, to flit by beneath the spell of “in-
spired intercourse.” Very well, for all of these, but tb none'will read-
ing in bed, claim inferiority of position^
After you have been ejected from, the cafeteria, when the hall
is hushed'and the clatter of industrious typewriters is replaced by a
. rumbling nasal buzz, try brie of your favorite books in bed. You will
soon discover the proper angle for the light, and for the pillow, and—
not quite so soon—the proper book for the occasion. Beware of the
dry tome—it has been found to increase the electric light bill out-
rageously.
Try this tonight! You may feel tired, the following morning, but
. sustaining you through the day will be the thought'.of those few hal-
- low.ed hours, after.the watchman has made his first round, when you
. and-your; favorite-author^can really '“get together,” and he caii speak'to
you and you can. listen to him, uninterrupted, comfortable in mind and
body, and forgetful of the rubbish and worries of the day.
That was sure a good one,
Said the first as he missed
A newsboy "with his“cigarette. ''
Now to change the topic I
Want you to help me. out. I got
Into an argument trying to prove
That men aren’t greater '
Than women.
They are, said the other.
They ain’t, said the first. '	♦
The other said. Listen, and
We listened. Then he’said.
WORDS
An old Latin proverb is that “he who does not; know, how to express
that which he. knows is no better than if he did not know.” The truth
. of this is undeniable, but very few of us remind ourselyes of its great
significance. But if a man is to appear before his fellows as he is, if
he is to show his mind at its best, he must be able to command words.
. Words are the means God has given us for transferring our
thoughts to others. It is not difficult to use words, but it is difficult to
use them,to say what you mean, difficult to convey the precise impres-
• sion to the listener,that is.intended. This is because words are not the
reality, and must fall somewhat short of the realitybut the man who
knows words, insomuch approaches the reality. Words can but act as
bridges > between minds. If I say the sea is blue, it may be any one of
. a thousand blues. If I tell you of an act that someone did I can not
give you anything like iny actual impression/, which was by means of
five senses, while yours is by means of one, sound, my voice.
Because of the feebleness of his vocabulary the ambitious man
- seeks to increase his acquaintance with words. A man ought to learn
one new J word every day. Every .man reads something every day and
meets a word, perhaps a very common one, that he can not define, of
which he does not‘know the etymology, or proper use. A study of
words is .interesting as. welTas good. The expression sign your name,
for instance, originated in the days when men could hot write and had
to sign; their names. , These studies are interesting. When a word
of. doubtful meaning, derivation, or. use,is found, a note should be made
of it. A.fter noting the word and learning to understand it, it must be
used. Until the word has been used in speaking or in writing several
times, it cannot be remembered, but use it several jiffies and it is yours.
: ( You must get into, the habit of looking intensely, at words, and
assuring yourself of their meaning, syllable by syllable—nay, letter by
, letter,” Ruskin says/ “For though it is only , by reason of the opposi-
' tion of letters in the function of signs, that the study of .books is called
• ‘literature,’:and that a man versed in it is called, by the consent of na-
tions, a man of letters instead of.a man of books, or of words, and
- you might read all. the books in the British Museum (if you could live
• long enough), and remain an. utter ‘illiterate,’ uneducated person;
• but if you read (ten pages of a good book, letter by letter—that is to
say, with real accuracy—you are forevermore in some measure an edu-
cated person. The .entire difference between education ;and non-cdu-
. cation (as regards the merely intellectual part of it), consists in this
accuracy. Whatever language a well-educated ‘ man knows' he knows
precisely; whatever ..word; he pronounces lie pronounces' rightly; above
all, he. is learned in the peerage of words.” /.

A letter written on the station-
ery of the office of J. Lloyd McMas-
ter, law offices, Lincoln, Nebraska,
is as follows:	’
November .21, 1923.
To THE NOTRE DAME DAILY:
. My attention has just been called
to an editorial published in your pa-1
per of a few days ago entitled “To
Those Who Can Read.” I am writ-
ing this in the-hopes'that you may
see fit to publish it, ; and, whether
you believe it or not;, the facts are
true. .■	..	.
I have been, in the capacity of a
student, an alumnus, and a coach,
in the University of Nebraska cov-
ering a period of the last 12 years.
I am one who believes, in accor-
dance with the present athletic ad-
ministration at Nebraska, that clean
sportsmanship, clean student loyal-
ty; and keen appreciation of merit, ’ t
whether exhibited by the team rep- ;
resenting our own school or that of
an opponent, is the thing to be at-
tained above all in college athletics. ;
I believe that the writer of that ed- ?
itorial did so without a knowledge
of' the facts, without a knowledge
of the esteem in which the Notre
Dame football-team is held, and
without, appreciation • of that spirit
of clean sportsmanship that .it is the
effort of the Athletic Department of
the University of Nebraska, and, I
am sure, the Athletic Department
of the University of. Notre Dania s
to build up in college athletics.
-- The-'University of tNebraska; 'it's'
students and faculty, and the citi-
zens of Lincoln and the states of
Nebraska. have always 'held in high'
esteem. Notre Dame and its football
team. We have appreciated the
hospitality evtended us when on
visits to the University at South
Bend, and it.has been our earnest
endeavor ' to ' return in kind that,
hospitality when Notre Dame came ,
to Lincoln. The greeting always: .
extended to the Notre Dame team,
in which five thousand students par-
ticipate, is always reserved until
the occasion when Notre Dame ’
comes to Lincoln; ' No other team
on the schedule is < accorded that
welcome if Notre Dame’s game is to
be played at Lincoln. .

' Among the theatrical attractions
f interest to those who will spend
Thanksgiving in Chicago is the play
•which Mrs. Fiske is opening at
PoWers this week. “Mary, Mary,
Contrary” is a elever little
Y edy in which the. ever popular
Mrs. Fiske does the type of acting
which she is best.
«jferton of the Movies,” in which
Clenn Hunter and Florence Nash
through their paces, has been
wiled the best show in town by
Charles Collins of The - Post, ’ and
he gives it his unqualified approval.
It is only fair to state that a num-
ber of' other plays have come to Chi-
cago since Collins issued his, state-
ment.
“Abie’s Irish Rose,” an over-
rated play, somewhat impossible in
plot, has been cruising about in the
offing, looking for a theatre to house
It, It was finally announced by the
management that if they could not
get a theatre ’ this week they
would open in a tent. All of which
is interesting, if true. ' .
Channing Pollock’s “The Fool,”
the theatrical sensation of last sea-
son,is by.no means to be overlooked.
It has. created more comment, both
pro and con, than any play that has
appeared for years. Whether you
care for Mr. Pollock or not, it is
{fairly difficult to deny that he is
aivable dramatist, and his . play
gives what is referred to by the
hackneyed phrase, “food for
thought.”
If you like comedy, you will find
it in “The Old Soak,” in which Tom
Wise tells, or rather always prom-
isis to tell, the audience what the
bar rooms were like in pre-prohibi-
tion days. “The Old Soak” enjoyed
a prosperous run in New York with
Harry Beresford, but it does not
suffer in the least, by the presence
bflhe^geniar-TonrWise. ;
It would be contrary to the con-
stitution and by-laws of this col-
umn to write anything about Chi-
cago plays without mentioninig

Clown, Laugh.” That opus closed

after, the game this year was that
•they played hard football, but it
was clean. That, in my estimation,
is the greatest tribute that can be
paid to any football team. Nebras-
ka has had ah experience this year
to which 'that tribute could not be
paid to the defeated team., •
Your editorial is scathing, and
one which-1 make bold to state is
undeserved by the student body and
the Nebraska football team. Ne-
braska met Notre Dame in a con-
test and was victorious. They met
Notre Dame’s clean, hard playing
in kind, and emerged the victor. Of
course they were elated; of course
the student body were overjoyed at
the results; of course the great
stadium was ringing with the cheers
for both - team's. Your, editorial
makes it appear that a personal af-
front was offered to the valiant
team that had gone down in a glor-
ious defeat, that an; affront had been
made to those loyal supporters of
Notre Dame who rendered a cour-
teous tribute to the victors. Such
an affront can only exist in the
fancy of the writer of the editorial,
or the minds of a few disgruntled
rooters who are not good sports-
men. All of the. thirty thousand
people who witnessed this game'
who are willing to give a fair-
minded judgment of it will say that
no such thing existed, that the stu-
dents of Nebraska and the Nebras-
ka football team appreciated the
ability and clean, hard football
playing of Notre Dame, and that
any spirit of smallness can be at-
tributed! if at all, to only a very,
very small minority present.
I trust you will give this public-
ity, as I know that I represent the
sentiment of a vast majority of the
the people who saw that game, and
thatt he tenor, of the editorial here-
in referred to and others of the
same spirit do more to tear down
the fine spirit that is being builded
by the educational’institutions than
any other form of unfairness.
By, a loyal Nebraskan who appre-
ciates ' a worthyr opponent.

the genuine welcome on the eve of
the game, the attention of the
Corncobs and other organizations
is given at hrust—and above all,
Nebraska has been accused of in-
sulting her guests. That is more
than Cornhuskers can stand.
• Nebraska students cheered Notre
Dame when, she made desperate at-
tempts to tie the score, Nebraska
students gave yells for Notre Dame
men when they were injured. Ne-
braska students applauded spectac-
ular passes—and we suffer a re-
buke.
Two years ago the Cornhuskers
went to Notre Dame. Stories of the
hospitality still are told on the Ne-
braska campus. Nebraska has tried
to return the compliment in the two
years that the great team has some
west—and Notre Dame says that
Nebraska failed—failed miserably.
Notre Dame, as honorable a foe
as ever met Cornhuskers on Ne-
braska field, has accused Nebraska
,of insulting her. The immensity of
the accusation has cut deeply.
Notre Dame, we are sorry.

made up of little jolts, very similar
to those received when a string of
beads break and each bright bead
goes bouncing, rolling and tinkling
into the-most obscure corner. s
A freshman comes to the univer-
sity with many hopes and ideals for
what an educational institute, and
the people in it, in her estimation,
should be.. It does not take long for
that string of beads to break—-an
idolized upperclassman shows that
he is only human; the students are
not super-beings; and many of the
professors look like business men.
Then the freshman seeks to re-
trieve their lost, ideals and to
painstakingly reconstruct them. To
be sure, many of them are insig-
nificant, but often it is the smallest
bead that proves the most trouble-
so me. She usually finds that a few
are lost permanently—the others
may be restrung, but often it is im-
possible to form the old pattern.
