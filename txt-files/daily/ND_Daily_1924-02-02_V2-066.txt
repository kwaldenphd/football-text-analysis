Exalted Ebenezer Grundy: ,
We have read for sometime in
the DAILY about the best dressed
man on the campus. About every
hall has been represented but' the
one on the east end of the campus.
With the populai’ approval of the
inhabitants of this hall, ;
nounce Mr. Krebs, as the
should receive this honor,
from the southern part
where he is quite a scion
we an-
one who
He hails
of ’ Ohio,
at social
gatherings.	_
Hoping, you will announce him
as a candidate, for he is quite dis-
tinguished by his black 'curly locks.
Sincerely, .
W. G. H.

• Just as a matter of curiosity, and
to disprove the assertion of “one of
the Hunchbacks,” that the answers
given in the Daily Questionnaire are
. marked by “scant imagination—lim-
ited viewpoint,” Thave Taken it* up-
on myself to determine the truth
or error of this matter, and under
cover of eleven different disguises
whent forth (sailed forth more
properly) on our campus beautiful

accosted five representative ' men

“What is. your opinion and atti-.

the common good of the student
body, and should be abolished, de-

Glee Club to Give
Concert Tonight
The Notre Dame Glee club will
give the first of a series of concerts
in the largest cities of the East and
Middlewest tonight when it appears
in Indianapolis under the auspices
of the Knights of Columbus council
of that city. The concert will be
held in the Knights of Columbus
auditorium. .
Dr. Browne, directoi’ of the Glee
club, and Joseph Cassanta have ar-
ranged a splendid and varied pro-
gram to be presented at the Capital
City.

TEAMS PLAY TODAY
Irish Sextet to Meet Culver on Local
Rink; Novel Events on Track
Program.
MANY ENTRIES IN
MASCOT CONTEST
Contest Closes at .Noon on Sunday;
Winner Will Name •
Mascot.
• Competition is keen for the five-
dollar prize the DAILY is offering
•for the best name submitted for
the new.Notre Dame mascot. There
have been many responses and will
probably be. many more before the
competition closes at noon on Sun-
day, February 3.
Many and varied are the names
that have been suggested; they run
all the way from names borrowed
from the classics to such names as
Spark Plug, Triple-X, and Mr.
Grundy. ,	\	■	,
The committee to decide the
winner of the contest is composed
of Professor William Conley, Knute
K. Rockne, and Father Patrick
-Haggerty, C. -S. C.; The-winner-as
.well as the winning name will be
announced in the Tuesday issue of
the DAILY.	.
: “Mickey” was the first name sug-
gested in the contest. This name
was first brought forth by John C.
Petrone, but evidently it is a-popu-
lar one, for it has been duplicated
by various other men. '	’
“Petey,” “Gobi,” “Pete Vaughn,”
and “Mike Rockne” were suggested
by Art Monaco, Harold Van Huff el,
B. C. Favero, and Paul D. Hoeffler.
■ Frank Murray thinks that “Ter-
ry” is very appropriate, while Clint
Gleason likes “Pat.” “Clopin” was
suggested by an unidentified con-
testant, who shall probably remain
forever so.
These are but a few of the varied
offerings that have been received.
Don’t forget the date, February 3,
and have your suggestion in early.
All entries must be addressed to
the Editor of the DAILY.
CONCERT MONDAY NIGHT
Jesse Isabel Christian, who is
considered one of the best concert
and operatic sopranos in the world,
will appear in Washington hall on
Monday, February 4. He has given
exhibitions in Europe and America
for many years.	.
With the state hockey champion-
ship at stake, the Notre Dame ice •
team will take on a more formidable
rival on the St. Mary’s lake rink at
1:30 o’clock this afternoon than .
advance dope had pointed out. The
Culver sextet will appear here
against the McSorley clan with, a
fast, clever aggregation of stick-
men, who showed remarkable abil-
ity in defeating the Marquette team
2-1, last week.
The downstaters have a snappy
offensive game, passing and drib-
bling the puck with no mean ability.
The local sextet has had consider-
able experience in this line also,
having stacked up against some of
the fastest opposition in the coun- •
try when they went to Pittsburg.
In view of the fact that the
present warm weather has made the
condition of the ice around the out-
side of the rink rather uncertain,
Manager Tom Lieb issues a warn-
ing to all spectators at the game to
remain on the shore, rather than
risk a cold ducking, should the
weight of a crowd cause the ice to
give away.	’ -	.	'
The annual Varsity-Freshman
handicap meet, to be run off in the
gym at 3 o’clock, promises to be;
one of the most interesting meets “
of the year from the local point, of
view. The feature races in partic-
ular will attract a wide interest.
The big "event of the meet will be ~'
the race for the heavyweight-
championship of the University.
For the past two years, this event
has been copped by Frank Thomas,-
varsity quarterback. This year
there is a promise of great rivalry
between Cleary; and Frank Mil-
bauer.	.
Outside of the regular track
events on the program, there "will
be 40-yard dashes for football, ■
baseball, and'basketball men and'
novices races , in the hurdles.
The meet will afford an excellent
chance for comparison of the work
of aspirant, trackmen with the vet-
erans-who will start from scratch.
Leap Year Juggler
Out Last Night,
The Leap Year number of the ’
Juggler:: appeared on the campus ; '
last night. The cover design by
Joseph Foglia is exceptionally well
/lone. It is colored very elaborately
and easily the best that has ap-
peared this scholastic year.
Aside from the usual collection
of cartoons, the Juggler has many
skits, jokes, and verses about the -
Leap Year that are splendidly
written.	•	'
THE CONTEST
- The Faculty Contest Board has found it necessary to penalize |
certain clubs for casting fraudulent ballots. The board desires to |
announce, that a slight .change has been made in the penalty. For !
the first infraction of the rules the ^penalty has. been set at 10 I
ballots. The. penalties for any further dishonest voting will be j
of a personal and proportionate nature. Latest tabulation fol- |

THE COTILLION IS COMING!
- - In a. few weeks, the sophomores, those gentlemen whom , not so
long ago. we tolerantly referred to as the “freshies,” will.-provider fori us,
the-first of the three big,events which are: to fashion the red-letter days
on the social calendar at Notre Dame this year. The Cotillion, so suc-
cessfully accomplished last year.-in its. first:formal debut, will be, we
are certain, flawless.? Time and energy without stint are being expended
in.an-endeavor.- to.make.-it an evening that will long be-a pleasant and
colorful memory.. On , that evening, if other similar evenings -are a
standard^ the magnificent ball-room of the Palais- Royale will be the
scene of : an extravaganza of shimmering silk and white fronts. It
will be decorated with a -splendour equalling the ‘‘iridescent glamour”
’which marked .the Pr om: and the Ball last year. Graced by the radiant-
forms: of a-- hundred charming companions, the Cotillion promises to
z bea'dazzlingspec taele of1 pomp and pulchritude, a festive event in .the
life of the sophomore, an anticipatory thrill for. the junior-and senior
whose class' dances are the; bigger and more, sedate brothers of the,
'Cotillion; Gala'occasions of this kind,at Notre Dame have always been
successful,/because of ? the high standard, of” entertainment set-.and at-
tained by each class. The Cotillion will bp. of this high standard. You
will be sorry afterwards if you miss it. The^Sophomore class , is be-
hind, it and there is a waiting list for upperclassmen. Certain other
preparations, on your, part> are necessary—and.it is time you were mak-
ing them.	,
COFFEE; NO T TOO MUCH CREAM
’•Hot, golden coffee-—not-top hot so that you have .to pour water in
it-:for.a cooler—coffee of exactly the soul-warming temperature neces-
sary to endure an;8 o’clock class, with toast, just the color of ripe wheat,
the kind; that- breaks with a : crunch, after the butter has got into its
pores—that is what we-call'an-ideal beginning. . It'should ’offer a very
considerable-, incentive to most of us whose epidermis is ;peculiarly sen-
sitive, particularly: about; 7:30- a. m.—probably due to heredity—but
who absolutely have to leave the window open at niglit.
But the trouble is with the line. . You get your-toast, and unless
you ask them to give it a second going over, it always is like, scorched
(?) bread. You may as well get biscuits. And when you (get-down to
where the butter sets, the toast usually-has-lost too much : warmthf-to
allow, the butter, to spread evenly. And even -chances' your coffee
will be the right color. Other times it! is ;tbd little, or too much. But
you. can’t wait to have it .diluted to the right point; because the line
must move, and you’ve got to make your class.- How many is it, five
or six cuts already? And even if you did go so far. as to ask to have
your coffee changed, you would hot feel right, out of place and all that.
So you move on. Which explains who so many of us.sleep, instead. ;

THE TURNOVER
Mr. G. K. Chesterton once wrote
a: book, entitled ‘Whats Wrong
With the World?” In the course of
his . investigations he. found that
many, things were in complete dis-
order. It is a\pity that this same
clever writer did not or does not
■write a volume on “What’s Wrong
With Education?” Many have
written about it; more have writ-
ten at it. But‘it would take a: gen-
uine chestertonian pen to do the
subject justice.. Mr., Chesterton,
seems to discover paradoxes by dint
of much shrewd observation... But,
if one is to believe the critics, the
field of education simply runs wild,
withthem. •
- 0—0	•
’ .There seems to be so much’wrong
with education. that even if-it is
still true that men are constantly
seeking, it, many, are . having, diffi-
culty in finding out just what it is,
because many educators themselves
are either at a loss as to what , to
tell themor in despair at ever get-
ting, them to accept what is offered.
The. truth. seems to be that: every-
body knows . what is wrong with
education,. or at .least that every-
body knows that.,something, is
wrong with it. From time to time-
not only do the professionals essay
to inform the world—and especially
.the University* world—of its radical
defects, but also the industrials'and'
the merchants,—-yes,, even unhum-
ble toilers of the soil rise to have
’their . say. Only the despised., hoi
polloi seems to realize how to mind
their own business,—though that, is
precisely what none of thenr have.

! Were one to believe- all 'the- bad
things irresponsible. scribes and. re-
sponsible; scribblers' .assure— us- is
>vrong with our; educational,system,
nothing-would- be left of it but a
pitifully unsystematic system of
glaring- incongruities. and startling
deficiencies. Education as she . is
given, or driven^ would come dan-
gerously.near a constitution of 100
per cent-privation." We ourselves—
and we do not pretend to be either
much or many—have jotted- down
just a few of these supposed 'short-
comings.	'
Here they are: Our education
lacks scholars and the appreciation
of scholarship, the very first requi-
site for an educational institution;
we teach things that are perfectly
useless (note the qualification); we
take at least five years too long to
do it in; we-are hide-bound with
tradition; we do not train for mod-
ern life; not only Europe with its
centuries of tradition and civiliza-
tion, but also our next door neigh-
bor, Canada, who still has more
timberland than'we have, are miles
ahead of us in matters and modes
of learning; most of our College
.graduates know less than the grad-
uates of a secondary school abroad;
they have no view, of life; no bal-
ance nor ballast, no tastes or am-
bitions, little courtesy and not an
over-keen sense of honor; and fin-
ally (i. e., for the time being), as
costs go up efficiency comes down.
o—o
Dear fellow workers,—anyhow,
dear fellow students, yes,, also, dear
professors and i dear old school,
isn’t it really shocking, just per-
fectly awful how thoroughly worth-
less we all'are! How utterly we
•need redemption! What dreadful
failures! O tempora, O mores!
o—o
Do you not believe all these
charges? . You do not. If you did,-
there would not be enough positive
reality left to you " to serve as a
target for criticism. You of course
wilk have. your say, and your say
ought to be strong. We say that it
is about time somebody were sug-
gesting .to educational convention-
ists and educational experts and. un-
educated critics of education to let
up on this- plague of: pessimistic
and pretentious howling and-—well,
“See America First.” In determin-
ing. values,, the .highest1 estimation
is often set on a thing of lesser ab-
solute worth if.for no other reason
than that it involves a question of
self-respect. Even though these
critics have lost air respect for our
education and_ educational institu-
tions, we cannot lose respect for
ourselves, and as it is our education
that has made us what we are, it is
possible also not to - retain' a gen-
erous amount of respect for it.

; George' eJan .Nathan. Alfred- A.- Knopf;-
Publisher.
It is not often ?that a magazine
is subjected to the, more-or less,
critical eyes of the. reviewer. Their
rather transitory and" ephemeral
nature saves them, as a. rule, from
formal scrutiny.-. “The American
Mercury,” chiefly..because of: its in-
teresting editors, however,- has been
much discussed this last month- by
many. critics.- The New York'Trib-
une,-.for .-example,, has thisto say of,
“It will be interesting to,.see how
this transplanting into orderly, not
to say ; formal; garden" will ? affect
the growth, of these literary cut-
ups, (Mencken and Nathan). They
have lived long-by sheer smartness,,
acting; like nothing so much as? two
$mall urchins-at - a- fair," running
about:and pricking,;the- toy.balloons.
that other children were proudly
waving.” This is as good a’char-
acterization of Mencken : and- Na-
than. as we are likely to hear. ? Their
little literary practical jokes have
become as noted -as Shaw’s Olym-
pian. conceit.
I The; editors of - the American
Mercury have succeeded in. the two
issues that have already been, pub-
lished in expressing,, a great deal of-
their personality with an appro-
priate‘amount- of restraint... The de-
partment they reserve exclusively
for their own expression is • entitled
“Clinical" Notes;”' Here: one may

QUESTION: What do you think
of this week’s bill at the Palace?
WHERE ASKED: Doesn’t mat-
■ ter.‘	. .
ANSWER: In our opinion the
show ' is slightly above. normal,
which means that it supplies pretty
fair entertainment to the tired
amusement-seeker. In nominating
the pieco de resistance, as we now
call it, we should undoubtedly
choose Danny Graham’s Revue.
There are three girls and a fellow
in this act who are just about as
handy with their feet as any danc-
ers we have seen. This is a real
number.
He’s still up to' his old tricks.
Last week we devoted a consider-
able- space and some high-powered
adjectives to praise Houdini’s act.
This situation-remains the same.
- Peck and Harris get off. a few
good cracks.and a great many more
that were all the rage when grand-
ma was a soph. In our opinion this
act was' the weakest on the pro-:
gram.
Bee Ho Gray-and Company pro-
vide • some • very interesting enter-
tainment in the line;of trick;roping
and knife-throwing. We’d hate to
see this act on one of Bee Ho’s ner-
vous days;; . •• .	..
• Ernest Hiatt has us worried. Per-
sonally we thought his was rather a
dismal attempt at comedy, but the
deafening-, encores he received have
us; guessing. Perhaps they’re all
out of step but the dramatic critic.
Here’s. the case in a nutshell: Er-
nest Hiatt got over in great style
but we didn’t like_him.
. “The Marriage Market” is - the
name of the picture, and if takes
: some, nasty cracks-*at parents who7
sell beautiful daughters to the high-
est bidders. “What would marriage
be:without love?” asks the .little
heroine and the whole picture is de-
voted to proving that it wouldn’t
be‘.much. The picture is interest-
ing. .	-	'	.

Dear Editor: .	.
I I have just read the December
issue of The Scholastic, an editor-
ial headed “For.' the Abolition of
the:Time Clock,” in;which the fol-
lowing statement is-made:. “It
should hardly need a. great deal of
reflection to conclude that student
employment is an evil.” Whoever
wrote this article, is evidently one
of the “scions of the more opulent
families” which he mentions.
• Since when is it that in “the fal-
low hours of idleness, a student’s
mind ripens and ;multiplies?itself”?
If I remember the; old platitude cor-
rectly—An idle mind, etc. The two
statements don’t seem to square.
I am willing to admit that a certain
amount of leisure and recreation is
invaluable to the student, but with
only twenty out of one hundred and
twelve waking hours spent in the
classroom and about the same time
in study, it is obvious that entirely
too much time is given to “idle
hours.” ' .	•
; It is very true that the. associa-
tions and companionships formed at
college are an important part of
our education, but when the social-:
educational: ratio becomes '70-30
with the educational on the wrong
side of. the ledger, it is time to give
the matter serious thought. You
men whose indulgent fathers are
sending you to college, if you be-
lieve the idle hours much better
than study, had best go-home and
study an .hour or two a day in the
public library and spend the rest of
your time in the lobbies of '.the bet-
ter hotels. A great many broad,
acquaintances can be formed and,
—it won’t cost ■ your fathers so
much'to educate'you;	•

Carroll and Day, the pace setters,
' appear to be the strongest contend-
ers for the championship, as far as
. can be determined by the playing
of the teams in the few games that
have been played. • Both teams have
_ . displayed nice team work and
marked talent in throwing baskets.
The Sophomore . vs. Brownson
game and also the game "between
Corby and Badin, in all probability
will be the hardest fought games on
the schedule Sunday, as these teams
are tied in the interhair standing
and will try to boost'their percent-
age. The Walsh tosseis will be giv-
en a lively fight when they meet thez
eagers from Sorin, who are now
resting in second place.
The teams will line up in the gym
tomorrow as follows:
Morning
Walsh vs. Sorin .... 9:30 to 10:30
Day vs. Cadillac ...10:30 to 11:30
Afternoon
are now open for the bowling
tournament to be staged on the
Walsh hall alleys beginning next
Wednesday, marks the latest / addi-
tion to the winter sport card at the
University.
Plans for the tournament which
have been formulated since the re-
suming of classes after the Christ-
mass holidays, are in charge of Paul
Kennedy and Ruben Mommsen.
Bowling will continue from 4 o’clock
in the afternoon until 7:30, and a
tax of 15 cent's will be collected
for each game. Kennedy and
Mommsen will receive all entries,
beginning today for which a fee of
50 cents will be charged for admis-
sion into the tournament. The
prize has not yet been selected.
