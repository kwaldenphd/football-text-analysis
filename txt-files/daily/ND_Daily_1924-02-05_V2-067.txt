“Whoooopppeee!” ' .	.
•	-o- -o-	■
. My first outburst in. weeks! Rea-
son: the Well-Dressed Man Con-
test is on its last lap—or rather,
down to the last trouser leg; for the
end cometh. Thursday. I have sug-
gested that extra copies of that is-
sue be printed to satisfy the de-
mand, . for, verily, the man’s name
will creat a stir (raising no dust be-
cause of weather conditions).
.	—o- -o-
So today’s, humble effort will be
the kindliest of all my kindly sallies,
containing merely' contest informa-
tion. (You see the DAILY insists
on your following some contest—
and this is SOME contest.)
-	’	-o- -o-
■ Why, the Sunday edition just had
to be omitted in order to give me
time to work on by Well-Dressed
duties./ So fast and furious have,
the votes been coming in that I
have not had occasion to enjoy the
post-exam stupor settling upon the
campus., I worry about: technical
terms like “dark horse,” “heller
vests,” “cravats”; and “choker muf-
flers.” -6- -o-	.
But my industry has been re-
warded; for arrangements have ac-
, tually been completed regarding the
cup, (which many of my followers.
, doubted) and immediately after the
announcement of the chosen one
the trophy-—described as “a truly
remarkable piece of workmanship,'
handsome, ornate, yet dignified”—
will be properly enscribed. .
-o- -o-	.
-THEN,: at the .first appropriate
‘ public- :-occasionp?-Tp:^
Grundy, will be present in person
' and the cup . will be 'given to the
lucky' (or worthy, I should ■ say)
candidate. “Count the days—--1”

“For the benefit of those readers
who came in late” permit me a ret-
rospect of the contest, an endeavor
unparallelled in the history of this
institution. . Starting with the let-
ter from« ah eastern clothing con-
cern seeking the name- of the best-
dressed man, or men, at Notre Dame
my Well-Dressed Man . Contest
leaped , into the pools Jof . campus
activities. Men who were deserv-
ing of. honor suddenly discovered
they had friends that were riot in
the least'bashful about suggesting
them as candidates.; Quietly,' yet
determinedly 'small groups' worked
for the success. of their sartorial
models. Truly, the contest was
running in good order.; \

, As a result of the interhall bas-
ketball games played Sunday, the
Carroll team is perched safely on
top with a perfect record of four
games won and none lost,' while
the Day squad is in second place,
tied with Sorin, as a result of its
defeat by Cadillac. The remaining
teams are strung out lower down
the scale. ' -	■
Carroll accomplished a double
purpose when it defeated the Fresh-
man squad Sunday, 23 to 16, by se-
curing the leadership of the inter-
hall standing and also keeping its
record clean. . Neither . team was
able to get started during the first
half and it ended with the Frosh
eagers leading, four to three. The
Carroll netters staged a real come-
back during the second period and
displayed the flashy playing that
has figured in their previous vic-
-tories/ John McNally, star forward
of , the?.;Carrollites, had an„ ability
■to evade the Freshman guards. and
dropped in field gdals from nearly
any position on the court.* During
the 'second^ half he piled up a total
of 14 points. : The entire Carroll
team put up a brand of playing that
would be hard for any team to beat.
DeVault played a nice offensive
.game for the losers, ringing
through. seven points for his team.
The biggest surprise of the day
was Cadillac’s victory .over the off-
campus team, 15 to 6. As a result
of the defeat the Day crew was
knocked out of first place' into a tie
with Sorin for second. The Cadillac:
loopers displayed the best form that
they/have shown yet, both offen-
sively; .and on the defense.' -Their

N.D. FIVE TO PLAY
WABASH TONIGHT
Pete Vaughan Boasts of Formidable
Five; Mahoney and Enright
Showing Great Form. •
Pete' Vaughan, former Notre
Dame athletic. star, will bring his
crack Wabash college basketball
team to South Bend tonight to meet
the Notre Dame five on the “Y”
court, which will mark the third
“big” game for the Irish eagers.
The Little Giants will present a
much more formidable aggregation
than all the advance dope said they
had. The Giants "have perfected
another smart court five that is
in keeping with their records of for-
mer years. In the long series of
basketball games between the two
schools, the downstaters* have had
the best of the argument by far and
are coming to the Irish camp to-
night fully confident of victory.
Coach Keogan has spent the time
since the Aggie game sending the
players through a series of hard
scrimmages that have perfected the
team work and the general floor
tactics of the Irish eagers. The
sensational shooting of Enright in
the Aggie game and the improve-
ment of Phil Mahoney’s basket
shooting will give the Notre Dame
five the best scoring combination
that the Irish have seen this year.
Notre Dame will have more than
a fighting chance to win, but the
downstate five is not to be. denied
their basketball ability. Vaughan
was one-of Notre Dame’s greatest
basketball players • and under his
competent coaching'the Giants have
.been ^turning L out-.7a. fast^quintet,
groomed in" all tife’-various'a^
the floor game. ;	_ 7
From all indications a record
crowd will be on hand to see the
Giants arid the. Irish clash, and the
doors will open at 7 o^clock. Stu-
dents come early. -
The Scribblers to Hear
Fr. O’Donnell Tonight
The Scribblers meeting at which
Father Charles O’Donnell, C. S. C.,
will speak, • has survived two post-
ponements and will be held tonight.
Father O’Donnell’s subject will be
“Poetry arid Some Modern Poets.’’
- Many of the Scribblers will pre-
sent theii’ original verse for Father
O’Donnell’s criticism; papers will be
read by Dennis, O’Neill and Frank
Kolars.	/ '	.
JESSIE ISABEL CHRISTIAN
; Jessie Isabel Christian, appearing
in Washington: hall last-night,, be-
fore a small audience, sang a pro-
gram 7 of English folksongs, and
French and English' classics, that
•were received 7 in ah enthusiastic
and appreciative manner. She was
accompanied by Gavin Williamson
at the. piano. ‘ ; ' 7. '	‘	7
Miss Christian’s voice, a mezzo-
soprano, evidences; long and care-
ful training arid the love for her
art that is the first requisite of an
artist, be he. sculptor, painter, or
musician. Her enunciation was un-
usually clear/ and„ her interpreta-
tion artistic/ However, in long
trills, she showed a tendency to
stray from the .true pitch, but, this
trifle became completely over-
shadowed by her excellent musician-
ship and technique in other difficult
passages. / '/	"	7
:, “The Nightingale of Lincoln Inn”,
she sang in-a beautiful style and-
fine voice. . She told the story of
the opera “Lakme” and followe'd it
with the “Bell Song” from that
opera. As an encore to’ this, she
sang a humorous ditty regarding a
fan. -	7 .	.	.	’
Altogether, Miss Christian is 7 a
fine artist, and the 7 program she
sang-at Notre Dame was typical of
her. ■' T /■	"

GLEE CLUB MAKES
SUCCESSFUL TRIP
.	- . ■	■	-1
Indianapolis Critics Praisd N, D
Musicians; Casasanta Leads
Organzation.
The Notre Dame Glee club pre-
sented a concert in Indianapolis
Saturday night. The offerings
were exceptionally well received- by.
an enthusiastic audience. - The en-
tertainment was held under the au-
spices of the Knights of Columbus,
who gave an'informal dance in hon-
or of the Glee club, following the
concert.
The Notre Dame organization of
approximately 40 voices was under
the leadership of Joseph Casasan-
ta, assistant director, and credit for
the “well-directed attacks and re-
sponsive leadership” (the compli-
ments of the Indianapolis Star)
must be given. Casasanta. The
discipline of the club in following
its director was also commented on.
The solos of Vernon Rickaerd,
tenor, and George Koch, baritone,
featured. Both singers responded
to several encores.. The club itself
;was_..callexLhack_t(i..xen.^
not on the. regular program, after
several selections received particu-
larly heavy applause.	\
• The Hike, song, written by ’ Cas-
asanta and Vincent Fagan, and ar-
ranged in parts by Dr. J. Lewis
Browns,.was one of the biggest hits
of the1 evening. Next in order of
popularity was the ever-new “Drink
to Me Only With Thine Eyes,” and
“Junetime,” by Dr. Browne.
Accompanying the Glee club on
the week-end. trip was Harry Den-
ny’s orchestra,» which played 7 the
dance following the program, and
featured “Lonely,” . by Victor
Labedz and Norb Engels. The
dance was very successful/ Notre'
Dame-details having been arranged
by Robert Rink, of. the Glee' club,
whose home is in Indianapolis. ..
On Sunday morning the club was
privileged to sing a motet at Saint
Peter and Paul Cathedral, assisting
the famous Cathedral choir. This
organization, of national reputa
tion, complimented highly the work
of the/Notre Dame singers. -	7,

FROSH WIN HONORS
IN SATURDAY’S MEET
Promising Material Uncovered in
Track Meet; Varsity Unable
to Overcome Handicaps. .
The varsity-freshman handicap
meet run off in the Irish gym Sat-
urday afternoon, proved to be more
than a practice session since it un-
covered some promising material in' .
the yearlings’ ranks. The Frosh
were able to dominate every event
of the meet with .the exception of
the high and low hurdles and the
pole vault. There were no entrants
in the hurdle events. .
The handicaps given the fresh-
men proved a little too much in
nearly every case for the varsity
men to overcome, and the Frosh
made a clean sweep in the dashes
after Layden had been eliminated "
in the trials for the finals, and took '
the first three places in the quarter
mile.	.	'
Young, the . freshman entrant
with a handicap of 60 yards in the
880-yard run, bested Paul Kennedy
by a scant two yards at the finish;
The yearling rolled in in 1:59 3-5.
The Irish ■ leader, finishing on his
heels, ran the half in a little better
than 2:02.	.	:	'
Some very .promising material ap-
peared in the pole vault. Hammill,
starting from scratch, cleared the
bar at 11 feet 6 inches with several
inches to spare. Carey and Har-
rington, also of the varsity, vaulted
li feet with inches to spare. All
three performers should add some
of the much needed power in the
field events with more practice.

A recent number of a national
weekly carried an'article under xhe
caption, “The Flattery of Compara-
tive Ignorance.” The opening par-
agraph quotes Mr. Zangwill as say-
ing that we are. “the, best half-
educated people' in the world.” The
former of these two statements, we
take, it, refers •'td our elders, rather
than to ourselves. For it has. been
our experience' that whenever com-
ment is made bn?what they knew at
our age, the compliment is invari-
ably pointed in their direction.
And that being so, the latter state-
ment will' be seized, upon by them
to justify this violation of becom-
ing modest. .	•	'
—o— •
This all implies of course—for it
is a virtual admission by the elders
:—that the younger generation is in-
variably backward, lacking in . that
precocity which they might have in-
herited,—but .didn’t. Thus if they
also make the same claim to higher
antecedent intellectual levels than
their children, it would seem that,
since the time of . our First Parents,
education has been' declining pro-
gressively with . each generation,
and that unless the- fatal vanity or
disastrous truth-can be eradicated,
there will come a time when the
precious off-spring of doting par-
ents will be perfe'et ignoramuses.
;	__ o—
Now Mr. Zangwill declares we
have already reached the half-way
'milestone on this'jdurney of intel-
lectual vacuity. : And his statement
ought to be as true as true can be
under the circumstances, and the
circumstances being "that he is an
Englishman illuminating us as to
the real state .‘of? affairs, we shall
have little difficulty in measuring
just how true it may be. Anyhow,
it seems now that we have a new
means ..of measuring the world’s
age. It is not. a geological clock,
for they rarely agree and more
rarely, register with any degree of
accuracy,. but what ’ we might sug-
gest be called a sociological or
genetical or. abintellectual. clock by
%hichj-M^vehN%'t&eTO
mind and a vivid .imagination (es-
pecially the latter) we may indi-.
cate the precise moment of the Gen-
eral Judgment. For surely Avheh
intelligence runs dry there will be
more reason for this' present uni-
verse careering through space.
CRIBBING
The exams having come and gone, their horrors become once again
a. fit subject for laughter. A week ago-one strained tender ■ muscles
when one laughed about the exams.	.■	.
But not everyone-is laughing.•: It was a great old game of crack
. the whip, for those who remained with the whip, but it was rather too
serious; a game for .those! who? broke away. -We sympathize with, those
who lost their hold and went sliding away from the rest of us. Yet in
truth these students only lost ’ their Jiold; in that they were more for-
tunate than some, who managed to’hold on only .by straining their self-
respect. Were it not'better to tumble away on the ice and Only scrape
your breeches rather than to hold your place and have your clothes
pulled to pieces? •	•	.
We refer to those who “cracked” the exams by cribbing. One- of
our: correspondents today refers to the same group. Read his letter-—
his wrath is righteous.	J f'/
This editorial is? largely written for freshmen. The observation
• of a few. years at Notre Dame:brings one to:the conclusion that crib-
• bing is principally an .indulgence’ of -under-classmen. Their sense? of
values-is •-usu sdly^eitti er ?f•&ls e-^£?“iunf ormedLi~LTliey_^ .tliihk.<to o-Yniicli 4.0L 1
their marks and too little of what true’benefit they derive from a class.
They would rather get by than get knowledge. They would improve
their credits by endangering, their characters.
By the time one becomes an ?upper-classman one is likely to have
acquired a little vision. One begins to realize many truths, one of
which is that one does not come to college. to'acquire grades, but to
build up a background in culture^ religion, and character. Cribbing is
one of the habits that endanger all three of these. And since into the
. bargain it is a tacit admission of .weakness,;the upper-classman usually
forgets about it, and takes his medicine if he has it coming. '
We would not be ranked with the purists who brand as a mortal
sin. everyone else’s least indiscretion. Sometimes even cribbing is a
hilarious battle of wits between prof and student; it is a battle fought
.for the joy of battling. But it is seldom so. Usually cribbing is an
indulgence for those who take this means of knocking, the first slat
’out of-the crib. . ...	';	- *
WOODR&W WILSON
. Today the entire world is lamenting the death of our former
president, .Woodrow Wilson. The- humble expressions of sympathy
which are pouring in from monarchs, diplomats, from personal friends^
from far and wide, to his bereaved widow, are all splendid laudations
and tributes of homage to his greatness. With the passing, even his
political enemies have become cognizant of his exceptional manifesta-
tions of character, and'join in with their candid eulogies.
Woodrow Wilson, like other individuals who have achieved such
enviable and responsible positions, exerted a tremendous influence upon
all with whom he, came into contact. And because of this exceptional
power of influence, which at. times seemed rather oligarchical, he found
in his lifetime manywho idol i zed "himandagain many who despised
him. But he realized that no matter what method he would adopt, he
would be subject to ridicule; and for that reason he championed so
ardently the cause which he deemed right, regardless of- political
threats, promises, or compromises.	:
Ai man who constantly displayed such extraordinary: traits of
character should be particularly interesting. to! us as students, because
back in 1875 he entered Princeton University, and like most of us, he
devoted himself not only to diligent study, but he also took part in
many of the university activities, such as. debates, athletics, and pub-
lications. He was human, and did not care to. isolate, himself entirely
in his room and do nothing but study; neither did hemeglect his studies,
over-estimating the value of university activities. He tried to keep a
proportionate balance between the two. And'then, even after he had been
-. graduated, he spent many years before his genius was recognized even a
trifle. When , his opportunities came,-however, because he had laid his
foundations securely, he was prepared to .grapple with any obstacle’
that impededdiis progress. :	'	. .. .	. ?
. . ; It may be generations yet before? Wilson’s - value to his country,
and to the; whole world for that matter; can-be properly estimated, be-
cause he had set his idealistic mind on a plan which, he hoped-would
. bring'about,international peace. But God called him before he could,
^witness the materialization of his ideal. Certainly1 those7 things he has.
। done will long be remembered, and if he has died a martyr to’his cause,
posterity shall not leave him uncrowned.
r. Now is the time to start cramming'for the next examinations/ .
- Top-Heavy Education
President Lowell’s : declaration
concerning the need" of closing the
doors of Ilarvard against too great
enrollment might? be- -regarded as
belying the old saying that there is
always plenty of room at the top.
It is a fact that many colleges and
universities - are ; overcrowded and
are adopting various measures for
limiting the numbers of. their stu-
dents. One of the leading universi-
ties recently reported the rejection
during the present/academic year
of several thousand ^applicants who
a few. years ago would have been
admitted, this being effected merely;
by raising the standard of entrance
requirements. . y
It is, of course, regrettable that
any one should' be'debarred from
higher education. Yet that is not
the worst calamity that could befall
us; nor are - such—-exclusions the
worst feature, of our-.educational
condition today. It . is immeasur-
'ably-worse' to have ^thousands of
children deprived? of; adequate facil-
ities for securing, any, education at
all, as has-been the case in this city,
and as is the case .in many places
throughout the land. It is also far
worse • to ■ have millions of adults
unable, and remaining'? hopelessly
unable, to read and write.
.: The fact is that the’, pursuit of
higher, education has in the. last
generation ; far " outstripped, bur
growth .in. population. •, In the -last
'third of a century our population
has increased by nearly .75 per cent,
while the number. of ., college stu-
dents .has increased by 340 . per
cent,?and that bf high school pu-
pils by 610 per cent. ? From one
point of : view that is , a; splendid
showing. It is fine to Have more
than 500,000 college and university
students and nearly 2,500,000 high;
THE TURNOVER
A Scotch professor, that is, lest
we be misunderstood, a learned
pedagog in Scotland, has concluded
that “the growth of knowledge has
been accompanied by a correspond-
ing growth of actual ignorance.”
This is a sad situation. And it be-
comes sadder, still when we notice
that he proves his contention,—by
asserting it vehemently and declar-
ing that his confreres in the Uni-
versity agree with him, Whereunto
shall we flee? we of the rising gen-
eration sinking into the slough of
“actual ignorance”-? We rise to in-
quire, ‘if you will pardon the sus-
picion of a paradox. Who will save
us from our fate? For. if uncon-
sciously we . are sinking, full con-
sciously, yea, even with a flourish
of adjectives, we should rejoice at
being yanked out of the quicksands
of imbecility and elevated into the
invigorating . atmosphere . of the
mountains of intellectuality. You
have heard our S. O. S. We await
the life-guard. ‘
. —o——
But enough of satire. In solemn
seriousness, if it be true—and we
are still unconvinced that it is—
that each new generation at a giv-
en age, or, at any age, is more ig-
norant than the preceding one at
the same age or any age, how can
our elders, who so periodically en-
joy the sweets of their self-con-,
ferred flattery, escape the accusing
finger which points either to their
unwillingness or inability to impart
to their children at least what was
imparted to them? Would it hot
seem obvious that with the accumu-
lated wisdom of their years and the
splendid and exclusive . opportunity
which has been theirs to educate
their off-spring, that all this “flat-,
tery of comparative ignorance” is
really nothing but an unflattering
confession of failure bn their part
to maintain standards and ideals?

At the Orpheum '
jn. “The Dangerous Maid” Con-
stance Talmadge makes her first
‘ appearance in a dramatic role, an
’attempt that is dangerous to any
comedian:.and consequently under-
taken only by the most courageous.
Constance, comes through the or-
deal in a satisfactory manner, but
the-elixir which her sister takes ev-
ery morning, along with her break-
fast seems to have had little effect
on Constance. At any rate she still
remains the comedian, and those
who have admired her in “Dulcy”
will like her in her latest produc-
•tion, , • '	■ ;	■ '	.
Her failure to develop dramatic
powers may be - due in part to the
story, which is not especially con-
ducive to emotional acting. There
are three scenes in which various
officers , of the King tell their at-
tendants that “they are. not to be
disturbed,” lock the door, and then
turn to confront the startled Con-
stance, who in the third repitition
of this .scene makes a brave effort
to vary the monotony. Under such
conditions even the elder Tal-
madge, .“the woman of a thousand
emitions”. would emerge with many
of her best emotions still on the
shelf.	j
Aside from'this the story is the
same old story of. other vehicles for
this star, this time told with the
' English of James' II as the 'back-
ground. Because of this fact or in
spite of it, the picture provides sev-
eral-typical comedy situations
which Constance uses to the. best’
advantage. '	' .	•. ;

you like Constance Talmadge as al
comedian and- Conway Tearle. as al

At The Palace '
“If it’s true that the applause of
the audience is the food of the ac-
tor, then Miss Seeley and I wish to
thank you for the lunch.” In thisj
rather original manner 'Bennie j
Fields acknowledged the many en-;
cores for “Miss Syncopation,” which;
is the.feature act at the Palace this;
week. Blossom Seeley and Benny
are past masters of the art of put-,
ting over a song, and in this act’
they are the life of the party. You
can’t go wrong in praising , this one.
Next in order of merit perhaps
we' should mention Joseph K. Wat-;
son, a Jewish monogist with a fair<
line of . humor. Some of his jokes
don’t even , average 99 44-100%
pure, but, of. course, Joe isn’t in the
soap business. ’	,
: Holmes and Holliston are good
for a few chuckles and perhaps a
j ' laugh or two.- It’s one of those acts
| about the old man who still has a
; weakness for the girls,, and the skit
is well received.	/ .

“Loving Lies” is the name of the

some exciting scenes, but there are

Students Listen to
Harry Houdini
Harry Houdini, the world’s great-
est handcuff and prison breaker,
addressed hundreds of Notre Dame
students Saturday noon on the sub-
ject of “Spiritism.” It was not gen-
erally known on the campus that
Houdini had consented to talk to
the Notre Dame men 'until about
two hours before his time of ap-
pearance. Even with such a short
notice,- -Washington hall was
crowded with students and faculty
members eager to listen to some
facts on the secrets that have made
Houdini famous.	,
■ Houdini, throughout his brief
lecture, assured his ■ audience, that
the seemingly baffling methods
which the present day mediums use
in their seances are 100 per’ cent
fraud; and he substantiated his
statements when he asserted that in
his past experience of 30 years he
has failed to find any medium’s
phenomena which he could not “ex-
plain and duplicate naturally.” He
did not simply make these state-
ments as potential facts—he proved
with: the aid of camera slides that
he -.had personally detected the
fraudulent methods of the country’s
most renowned mediums, such as
Sir Conan and Lady Doyle, Sir
Oliver Lodge, and Eusapia Palla-
dino.
One of the methods used by the
mediums is that of making a paraf-
fin. wax cast of the hand of the de-
ceased relative that is supposed to
have been summoned from the
other world during a seance. This,
they claim is conclusive evidence
that they actually communicate
with the spirit world,’because a wax
cast could not be removed from off
the hand without breaking it.. And
until-' Houdini’s recent experiment,
this-proof seemed rather plausible;
but Houdini has now completely ex-
'posed the trickery of. their “wax
cast proof” by making a paraffin
cast of his own hand and removing
it very easily without destroying it.
The cast he displayed and left as
a souvenir with the University. ,
Although Houdini,' who has
gained world^wide fame and recog-
nition by extricating himself from
leg-irons, shackles of all sorts,

INTERHALL BASKETBALL
(Continued from Page 1.)
defense -was too much for the Day
men to solve and the first half end-
ed in 'favor of Cadillac, 7 to 0. • At
the start of the second half the
Day Dodgers threatened to over-
come the lead by ringing through
two field goals in quick succession,
but the Cadillac team came” back
with another attack and again out-
played its opponents.' The Cadillac
ringers were nine points in the lead
when the whistle blew. This was
the first time this season that any
team has succeeded in shutting out
the opposition for half a game.
The hardest fought game-on the
schedule was. the battle between
Walsh and Sorin, the loopers from
Sorin copping the game, 16 to 13.
Both teams were tied in the inter-
hall standing and a real battle re-
sulted. Sorin got off to an early
lead, which it kept throughout the
game, although the shooters from
Walsh were close on the Sorinites
heels, never being more than two
! field goals behind. Stuhldreher, of’
the Sorin aggregation, displayed his
usual ability of making long shots
' from the middle of the court. The
Walsh men experienced difficulty in
, handling and passing the ball.
The Sophomore crew won its sec-
ond game of the season when it
handed a 26 to 22 defeat to the
Brownson, netters. The Sophs start-
ed off: with a rush and were lead-
ing, 12 to 5, when the half ended.
At the start of the last period
Brownson attempted to overcome
the lead but -■ fell short by four
points. At one time the Brownson
five was but one point behind their
run of several baskets and left the
Brownsonites behind. The entire
team, from Sophomore hall played
a nice game, and its team work was
the main factor in winning the vic-
tory. Bielli put up a nice game for
the losers, making several baskets
and playing hard on the defense.
The contest between Badin and
Corby, which was to have been
played Sunday, was postponed until
later in the week.
