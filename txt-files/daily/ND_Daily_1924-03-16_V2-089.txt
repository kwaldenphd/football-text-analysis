Observe today the interesting
and personal contribution from the
bard of the Poultry 'club. Need I
comment on its merits? Catch the
breath of the great; open spaces,
and feel the beauty of life under
the open sky—out -where a man’s a

Gentlemen, hear the mellifluence
of this'song:
Hayward’s Own Bunch ..
jTery morning: at eight o’clock—
In the spring when - the weather’s hot
Or plowing through the snow
When Prof. Hayward’s at his bench—
S»ys “Wake .up fellows, you’re not in the
’ trench.
Let’s drill down deep'till we hit the rocks,
And talk of breeding some fine cocks.
But if your poultry have some ills
Just consult' our Dr. Mills.” ,
In comes. Jim Latson red in the face .
With Thompson running for first place.
Next comes a. man by the name of Price,
Who thinks young pullets are very nice.
With Jordan out of the race you know
Carl 'Anderson'1 says,' “O boys, let’s go.”
Newman/ P^Pe, and Logan, too,
Are dathe game, but- thy’re still new;
But the Nelsons,; thy : are .young and spree
And so are Modraci and Obarski.
We’re all in the game of poultry farming—-
Sanderson, Wright, Alias, Horning. -
Just remember the names and get the
- hunch.	. „
Wouldn’t you like-to belong to Haywards
. bunch ?	....
And now with th close of our last year—
Let every fellow bear in mind	;
The good that he has been taught here,
And the friends he leaves behind/
Don’t say the professors are to blame—-
Don’t'lay your failures' to Notre Dame. '
‘ If you don’t make good and prove a dunce,
You'll get the razz from the, whole darn
•	? bunch. "	'	„ -	,

Day Dog Writer Complains Fickle Weather
Makes Choice of Wearing Apparel Difficult
: - There riiay be more than the pro'-
verbial hundred in one who "will not
agree with ’ us ' when we say
that we think the weather is rot-
ten; but . there is not much in that
statement.' What we are sore about
is the way Nature has been acting;
the uncertainty as to what one
should wear in the line of clothes
keeps us guessing from day to day.
One 'day;the spring has come (with
all - the elements that , accompany
it) and the next day, or sometimes'
the. next hour,- we are back in. the
middle of February. . , . ./.. /
. Last .week we awoke and gazed
out of the window toward the east .at
a beautiful morning sun. The rooin
was hot (because our room-mate
was?kind enough to close rthe win-
dow wheri he left for ari 8 o’clock),
the. air. was stuffy, and- looking1 at
that, radiant sun we were ' imbibed
with, the yearly affliction ! with
which all romantic young men are
K. OF G.INITIATION
IS POSTPONED
Thirty-five Candidates Favorably
Ballotted Upon; Executive Com-.
mittee Will Meet Tomorrow.
The Knights, of Columbus initia-
tion, scheduled for next Sunday af-
ternoon in Mishawaka, has been
postponed, -according to official ari- ■
nouncement yesterday afternoon.
A new date for: the initiation will
probably be fixed at a meeting of
the executive committee of Notre
Dame Council at 4 o’clock tomor-
row afternoon in the office of
father Paul Foik.
It was decided , to extend the
time of acceptance of applications
until next Sunday in order that
there may be a class of 50 or more
candidates. Thirty-five applica-
tions have already been favorably
ballotted upon. .
Exemplification of the first de- .
gree of the order will take place on
Thursday preceding the second and
third degrees and .will be in charge
of the officers of the local council.
The second and. third degrees will
probably be given on Sunday,
March 30, or Sunday, April 7.
St. Mary ’s Production
May Be Given Here
There is a possibility that a St.
Mary’s play will be given. at. Notre
Dame,. according, to . Professor Sul-
livan. Last year the Greek club
of St. Mary’s produced a Grecian
play which met with marvelous
success. -	; . .
A special.stage was built for its
production sihiilar to .the.great am-_
phitheater.; at Berkeley, California?
This stage was made out of papier
mache and it lent a scenic illustra-
tion which went, a long way. to make
the production; a success. . If. the
play is brought to Notre Dame, as
Professor Sullivan is trying to ar-
range, it will probably be staged in ,
front of the library. The library’
offers an ideal background ; for a
classic play and the lawn in front'
is a perfect setting. /
SENIOR BALL TICKETS
Frank “Pinky” O’Boyle, chair-
man of the Senior Ball ticket com- •
mottee, announced Friday that tick-
ets for the; Senior Ball will be
placed on sale Tuesday. The sale
of tickets will end.on April 26./
A deposit of $5 is required. > This
may be paid. any member of the
ticket committee and a receipt will
be given. When the $20 is paid,
the purchaser is to present the re-
ceipts; to O’Boyle and he will re-
ceive his ticket to the ball.. .
Seniors are urged to co-operate
with the comhiitteemeri and pur-
chase the .tickets as soon as possi-
ble. <"• ?••	;	'
acquairited::-we had - the spring fe-
ver—more than, we. have ever had
it. ' We frequently wished we were
where the one and only was; the
world was beautiful, everything
seemed; (from the window) to be in
harmony with .our feeling—we con-
cluded that spring was here. ’
We arose and .adorned our hap-
py self with fewer .clothes than we
were wont to wear, ^we left off ; a
sweater and ari- extra pair-of socks./
But we thought it was'so pleasant
looking, from our window that it
could be . nothing else outside, and
so. we started for. school..	. .	.
The , air was wonderfully invig-
orating—the air. that makes us glad
that we are alive, and—er—e?—
young, so we thought we. would
walk. Half way out Notre Dame
avenue. Mother Nature discovered
we were walking and hlso must
have been informed that we had
come out lightly clad—well, we
won’t do it again.

“LET’S GO!”
The first robin has* registered with Brother Alphonsus for a sum-
mer at Notre Dame, the first stray zephyr has blown over the St. .Joe
river, the freshmen are tossing a[ baseball around, before Freshman
. hall, and—spring has come to Notre Dame. • As these words are
pounded out the snow is flying, there is ice on the lake; but_ the “feel
is- in the air and it is' safe to say that spring is here. It Jias been a
long, cold winter and there are days of “undamed- sneezes” and slush
ahead, but spring at Notre Dame is a glorious tiriie and repays gen-
erously for the inglorious period which precedes. What say, men, to
making this spring a big success for everything Notre Dame?
The varsity, baseball team is practicing for its first season under
the tutelage of Coach Keogan. Soon there, will sound on Cartier Field
the sharp crack of bat on ball and the snappy conversation of a peppy
infield. Baseball is an important part of Notre Dame’ spring life;
why not support that team this year as never before? The success of
the ball team and of Mr. Keogan is" part of’ the success of spring, so
why not help them put over a great season? Then there is interhall
baseball. Intra-mural sports at Notre Dame seem to be. on the de-
cline; this spring should see every campus diamond crowded and every
student swingirig a bat.
/ The Monogram club is preparing for its annual minstrel. The
efforts these men are giving their production, the talent they have dis-
covered, bid fair to make the “Absurdities of 1924” a champion in the.
field of minstrels. Their success will be part of the success of Notre
Dame’s spring. The Drama club is beginning work on a new play.
It has had one notable success this year and the coming production is
keenly anticipated. It is hoped that the men of the Drama club
will give fully of their interest and enthusiasm to make their, play
another of the successes of the spring.	,	.	’
•This,then,is a wish for the spring of 1924 at Notre Dame: As ath-
letes, may Notre Dame’s men succeed in baseball, both varsity and iri-
terhall, as never before; as students, may they succeed in their classes;
may there be much spring fever; may there be many,swimmers in the
lake; may the campus grass loungers be more numerous than ever; may
the month of May find Notre Dame, deep-filled with the spirit of
spring; may all Notre Dame’s activities be great triumphs. Spring is
here—-let’s go! :	'
FIFTEEN TO EIGHT
Hats off to George Keogan and his basketball five!	*.
The Basketball-teairi has just completed.a most successful season,
a seaon in which, fifteen games were, won and eight lost, in a schedule
which was undoubtedly the most pretentious attempt by an Irish five
in recent years. Nearly every game was closely contested and decided
by a margin of only a few points, yet Captain Gene Mayl and his
team-mates put over, the winning punch;in two-thirds of the 'games,
achieving a very satisfying record.	,
. Playing five members of the Big Ten, the team defeated -Michi-
' gan, Minnesota, and Northwestern, arid lost to Illinois and Indiana by
narrow, margins. Another game with Minnesota, the first of the sea-
»-■ son, was lost by a single'point. This indicates the strength of the
squad which totalled 597 points to 501 for its opponents during the
year, v- - ' •	‘	’’	' -•	■
■ The record made by the squad was secured under handicaps such
- as few other schools, in the Middle West are obliged to face. The lack
of a playing floor at. Notre Dame forced the coach.to make arrarge-
merits for playing in South Bend. There the X. M. C. A. very courte-
. ously. extended the use of its gymnasium, but the team was obliged to
practice at times ’when other squads were playing on the floor
arid there . was a good deal of unavoidable interference, naturally de-
, tracting from the value of the practice. ’	‘ .
•Not only here at home was the team recognized as being of high
calibre, but. everywhere the players; went great crowds turned out to
see them play. At Springfield, Ohio, in one of the last games of the sea-
son, '3,500 seats for the Wittenberg; game were sold a week ahead of
. x .the contest. ; ’	.	J
;-This week the team will meet to select a captain for next season.
It will be the final act of the 1923-24 basketball team. To those who’
leave the squad ye, doff qur hats in tribute to work well done; to those
who. will bear the burden of the next campaign we pledge our whole-
hearted support. We are proud of you all! /	J ,
The main altar, with two faces^
located in the middle of the
Church, as. the heart in the body,
came from the ateliers of- Froc-
Robert, Paris. Its carving ■ repre-
sents as perfect symbolism as that
of the-great artisans of the Middle
Ages. Originally it stood in the
Church of. St. Etienne, : Beauvais,
and came into this country duty
free because it was lent for exhi-
bition. ,to. the - Centennial—Exposi-
tion at Philadelphia (1876). Its
carvings render carefully the story
of the twenty-first chapter of the
Apocalypse.
In the center gable of the rear
an angel enamelled in bright col-
ors holds a scroll and proclaims,
“There is a Tabernacle of God
among men,” “He will dwell with
them,” “They shall be his people,”
and “God in their midst shall be
their God.” .
The Alpha and Omega (Apoca-
lypse 21:7) which . appear in the*
little four-lobed windows over the
doors recall the promises made to
him . who shall be victorious. A
number of slender columns sus-
tains the Holy: Jerusalem, which is
square. In its great and high wall
there are twelve gates,: three on
each side, each guarded by an an-
gel. . Twelve enamelled plates bear
th names of tlje twelve ..tribes of
Israel,’ .and twelve foundations
support the wall; twelve plates on
the foundation bear the names of
the twelve Apostles. The city is
of gold and twelve kinds of prec-
ious stones.. The richly enamelled
gates b6ar the River of Living Wa-
ters, which flows from the; Throne
of God and the Lamb, and in the
midst of this river the Tree of
Life, whose luxuriant foliage gives
the leaves for the healing of na-
tions.	'
The Lamb crowns the city and
holds aloft the cross, the emblem
of his. triumph. “Dignus est Ag-
nus, qui occisus est accipere' coro-
nam.” He : bears a standard of
oyalty, and on his head the cru-
ciform nimbus. ■
r<
, The base of the altar is fash-
ioned like a shrine, the sides com-
posed of two arcades of brorize.
Enamelled angels in relief adorn
the arcades. , Six pilasters support
the table of sacrifice and form six
niches for exquisitely detailed
statues representing the virtues. A
garland of gilded bronze encircles
the- altar, recalling 'the passage
from Exodu$: “Thou shalt con-
struct Me., an' Altar, arid, thou shalt
surround it with}' a garland four
fingers high.” .	. •	- .
; The primitive and traditional
idea of ah altar included its erec-

SACRED HEART AT NOTRE DAME
(Continued from Last Issue.)
- On the walls of the Church we
have in order self-explanatory tab-
lets to Professor Lyons, Father
Lemonnier, Mr. Phelan (donor of
Washington Hall), and of Fathers
Cointet (an early missioner—af-
ter Father Badin), De Seille (pic-
tured in the Log Chapel giving
himself Holy Communion), and Pe-
tit (who with Mr. Phelan and Or-
estes Brownson are buried beneath
the Church).
Before the Main Altar seven
lamps represent the seven Spirits
of God (Apocalypse V:7). The
central and largest, the sanctuary j
lamp, of silver and cloisonne enam- I
elling, resembles an antique urn.
A pendant tells that it is a gift of
the Chidlren of Mary in the Unit-
ed States (1874). Three dragons,
struggling to escape, support the
chalice of oil. Their eyes are of
rose topaz, their heads of solid
silver, the plumage blue and gold,
with nine topaz and turquoise
stones glittering in their feathers.
The throat of each bears a beauti-
ful carnelian, the neck a crest of
malachite, and between the figures
three blue and gold shields repre-
sent scenes from the .Nativity of
Our Lord. The chalice is sur-
mounted by a crown whose circlet
is blue enamel with the inscrip-
tion, “In Him was Life, and the
Life was the Light of Men.” Ari
aureole of 12 gold and blue stars
ornaments the top of the crown.
Chains from the dragons’ necks
meet above the lamp as a whole
within a reflecting crown coiriposed
of' the • monogram A. M. (Ave
Maria).
for the word of God and the testi-
mony they bore for it”—Apoca-
lypse VI.9. An altar is not com-
■ plete in its liturgical significance
unless relics are placed beneath it;
and behind glass beneath the main
altar repose the skull of one of the
Theban legions and the bones of
one of the sufferers of early per-
secution in France—a boy martyr
of that period.
Only one altar in the world (that
of St. John Lateran in Rome) has ।
greater indulgences than the Main
Altar in the Church of Our Lady
of the Sacred .Heart.
Above the main altar Gregori
has\ painted “The Coronation of
the Blessed Virgin as Queen of
Heaven,” over the right side altar
he frescoed “The Death of St. Jo-
seph,” and over the left “The Ap-
parition of the Blessed Virgin to
Bernadette at Loudres.” On. the
ceiling of the arched recess be-
hind the main altar we have his
“Exaltation of the Cross,” a gift
in honor of Father Sorin, valued
in 1888 at $15,000.
The' rear altar, in this recess,
carved by Bernini (1598-1680)
nearly three centuries ago,'Father
Sorin purchased in Rome. It is
the only example of that artist’s
work in America. Bernini helped
decorate St. Peter’s and included
in this altar a piece of the wooden ’
table, preserved in the Church of
St. Praxedes in Rome, which St.
.Peter used as a portable altar.
The center of the base of this Ber7
nini is decorated with a carved pel-
ican; the tabernacle is of mala-
chite; the door is ornamented in
relief with a representation of the
Resurrection. Above the taber-
nacle golden cherubs support the
crucifix, the masterpiece of the al- .
tar. The Corpus on the cross is :
of olive wood. '
In a niche above this altar there <
stands a particularly lovely statue :
of Notre Dame. On her head rests ;
a solid gold crown, inlaid with .
precious stones and studded with
^pearls, , the gift (1866) of Em-
' press Eugenie, wife"of Napoleon
III. A jeweled crown, originally ■
intended for the statue on the
Dome hangs suspended above. On
it fifteen enamelled plates present
the fifteen mysteries of the Ros-
ary, while attached to the lower
rim are fifteen decades of crystal
[beads.
Back of the main altar and. to
the right, the middle apsidal chap-
el (The Reliquary) contains relics
of earch of the twelve apostles, a
piece of the manger at Bethlehem,
and pieces of the veil and girdle
of the Blessed Virgin. The re-
pository, on Jhe left contains rel-
ics of all the saints in the Church
Calendar for the first half of the
year; that on the right of those
for the second half. Beneath the
table of the altar in this chapel
you see a wax figure 'of- St. Severa,

S ।	■
one of the early martyrs—third
. century—-murdered by her pagan -
father for becoming: a Christian.
A framed tablet on the wall tells'
that her bones rest in the box be-
neath her pillow.
Above the altar Gregori has cop-
ied a section of Raphael’s great
fresco, “The Disputa,” one of the
most' celebrated masterpieces of
Christian art, representing the tri-
umph of Catholic faith in regard
to the Real Presence in the Blessed
Sacrament. (For a description of
the painting see the Scholastic 23:
29, 40,, 141).
In the third apsidal chapel on,
the left of the main altar hangs an
exact replica of the Miraculous Ma-
donna of Czeustpchowa (Chesto-
kofa) painted on cedar., This icon
is venerated at the most gorgeous
and famous shrine in Poland, now a
national sanctuary. When in 1655
the Paulite Monks at the shrine
repelled an attack of the. Swedish
soldiers of . Gustavus Adolphus,
they attributed the victory to the
Blessed Virgin. She was proclaim-
ed Queen of the Crown of Poland
and the king put himself and the
entire kingdom under her protec-
tiori. The history of the original
(according to Dr. Adolf Szyzko-
Bohusz, director of .. the Polish
Academy of Fine Arts at Krakow)
is of interest. It was painted
from life by St. Luke on the top
of a cedar table made by St. Jo-
seph assisted by Oui’ Saviour, then.	’
a boy. The father of St. John the
Apostle held it for a while; but at
the time of the destruction of Jeru-
salem. it .was remoyed^or_^afety.
During the persecution of the early
Christians ' it - was hidden in the
Catacombs. St. Helena, mother of
Constantine the Great discovered
it in the year 320 and removed it
to the Chapel of Constantine at
Constantinople, where it remained '
for five centuries. Early in the
ninth century the monarch of Con-
stantinople gave it (as a.token of
friendship) to. the Dukes of Belz,
Greek Catholics living near Luov,
Poland.
At the end of the 14th century
the Prince of Belz founded the
monasteryat Czestochowa and
placed' the picture therein.; In The
Deluge , Sienkiewicz describes it as
a symbol of the unity of Poland
and a hope of better times.

A BOOK
■	Reviewed by
REV. JOHN O’HARA,. C. S. C.
THE CANDLESTICK MAKER, by Lucille
Borden, the Macmillan Company, New
York.	•
“The things that seem not good,
yet turned to good,” Birth con-
sol is such a hideous thing that
even to speak of it seems to lessen
one’s self-respect. The philosophy
of selfishness behind it, the sordid
lust, the jealousies, envies, hates,
and murders engendered by the mis-
erable philosophy behind it seem so
much a part of hell that Christian
instinct recoils from the thought of
them. But birth control is a fact,
a hideous fact in modern life, and
there is no fact that Christianity
has been afraid to face; and it is
the perennial power of the cross, of
Christianity, to bring good out of
evil.
Miss Borden has written a pow-
erful novel and a lovely novel in
which she has faced this hideous
philosophy and left it a grinning
skeleton, and she has done it so
artistically that unbelievers must
read her book for the sheer beauty
of its romance.
• “The Candlestick Makers” is a
story of a cross section of New
York society. The. gold-digging
grass widows are as old as the hills
and only too familial’ to the readers
of the waders in the mire of pres-
ent-day fiction. The unsophisticated
New Englander is. a common
enough type in fiction, but the man-
ner of'her regeneration is so whole-
some that it is quite unusual. The
Catholics are different.. To be a
Catholic on Park Avenue between
the forties and. sixties one must
needs have character to live down
the “high hat” assumption. Miss
Borden knows her Cathedral parish
very well and she traces very deli-,
cately the Manhattan ville and
Franciscan, background that. gives
strong Catholic individuality to the
principals of her story.
New York, California, Rome, and
Japan are blended charmingly in
-the story, and each geographic unit
lends its bit of color to the ro-
mance. The action is swift, and—
thanks to the modern school—
For Refreshments

Visit
sketchy. The English is—no,thanks,
to the modern school—exception-
ally good. (The proof reading must
have been done by a victim of white
mule.)	,	.
There is no tiresome preaching
in “The Candlestick Makers,” but
there is some stunning verbal
scourging that will do your heart
good. Read the book and when you
finish the last page you will mur-
mur as you did when you finished
Kilmer’s “Holy Ireland,” “Thank
God, I’m a Catholic!”
What Others Say
Index
Almost everybody conscientious
in the selection of ^reading matter
inquires of somebody concerning
books that are and are not on the
index. The person qualified to
answer the inquiries, is of course,his
or her confessor. It has always
been recognized that in the matter
or mental pabulum, as in more ma-
terial victuals, one man’s meat can
be another man’s poison—although
the poisonous in literature is, us-
ually, poison absolute and unfail-
ing. '	•
- But something less than a com-
plete study of any corner news-
stand will convince even the unin-
formed that much objectionable
matter is circulated—the physically
and intellectually ephemeral char-
acter of which precludes recogni-
tion by the official Index.
Those zealous for suppression of
rot can give practical outlet to their
zeal by making known to their
news-dealers their disgust with the
gaudy trash more easily acquired
and therefore potentially more dam-
aging than evil books. The call that
Joyce Kilmer once made for a
clean-up of the corner news-stand
needs re-echoing wherever, (and
that is almost anywhere) brazenly
self-styled sex-stuff is offered for
sale.—Columbia, March, 1924.

Editor, NOTRE DAME DAILY:
The view from the west window
of my room is not particularly in-
spiring. A small one-story house
is the center of attraction. Off
there on the sky line is a huge fac-
tory, almost crowded out by the
house across the street.
The sun is not shining today;
the picture on my window pane is
painted in drab colors, and the fac-
tory is a shapeless mass on the
horizon. Ordinarily, the Indiana
sun floods the picture with golden
light: the factory is plainly visible,
sunbeams glint on the roof of
neighbor’s house, sidewalks
glistening.
The factory represents truth,
small house d the obstacles in
my
are
the
the
way of truth. The college man of
today, to my mind, makes the mis-
take-/of seeking truth from his
west window. To see the factory
more clearly, one must either go
closer* to it, or look at it when the

PLANTING SEASON LATE
Brother Barnabas, head garden-
er of the University, says that the
planting season is very late’ this
year, and that he will not be able
to do very much until April 15 at
least. There is at present from 8
to 10 inches of ice on St. Mary’s
lake, which is very unusual. .

ON THE LEVEL
. Joe Brandy, stellar quarterback
on the Notre Dame gridiron ma-
chine of several years ago, has been
chosen as director of athletics at
St. Thomas College, in northern
. Minnesota. . .	..	;
Brandy has enjoyed a great deal
of success in developing good foot-
ball and basketball' teams. Brandy’s
eleven made a creditable showing
last fall and his loop quintet has
' won the championship of its district
in Minnesota. . .	.'
: The great national game of base-
ball will have more than a passing
; interest for Notre Dame’s fans this
season. , In • particular they will
watch the doings of the Chicago
White Sox. The south siders are
. now in spring training, where there
is . being schooled under the capa-
' ble eye of Ed. Walsh and Johnny.
Evers Notre Dame’s own star twirl-
er, Dick Falvey.	.
Falvey will be remembered at
Notre. Dame. as long as the world
exists for his inimitable perform-
ance in the spring of. 1922, when
. Notre Dame played Iowa, on Cartier
• field. Becker of the Hawks and
Falvey .of the Irisha pitched magnif-
icent ball for twelve innings, neith-
J er side being , able to score. Both
teams were playing the finest kind
' of baseball^ that could be found
anywhere. The game was to be
called in the last of the twelfth and
-with three men on .bases and two
outs,. Notre. Dame’s pitching ace
came to bat and hammered a long
high drive into left .field that let an
. Irishman across the plate to win
the game, 1-0.
. ’ Falvey went into the minors and
played havoc with some of the best
teams in the American Association.
Right now-he is down in Winter^
haven, Florida, where Evers , is
grooming the Irish star for his for-
mal debut to Chicago’s south side
fans this spring. Dick has not lost
. his batting eye and to prove it, he
registered a circuit; drive off Red
\ Faber in the Florida camp last
week. .	.

Olympic trials^
Mutchiiison, who has sfifiri a good
many yards roll under his spikes,
looks forward with no small hopes
to1 the reliance that will be placed
in America’s young .sprinters and
quarter-milers. Still the veteran
speed star cannot -without some mis-
givings, overlook some of the old
stock in and around' New York who
have set themselves with the fans
by. their many years of brilliant
track competition. .	.
It should be - of no small interest
to Notre Dame that Murchinson
looks with much favor upon some
of' the star quarter-milers in our
Catholic Universities. Victor Asch-
er, formerly with the I. A. C., and
now with Georgetown, is slated to
be one of the choicest steppers in
the outdoor season. Herlihy, also
of Georgetown and formerly of
Holy Cross, is another brilliant
prospect that will be burning up
the outdoor track. Last week,
Herlihy scored a win over Harold
Fitch of the C. A. A., senior nation-
al champion in the quarter mile.
Ascher holds the junior title. .
. Tierney of Holy Cross is another
of the eastern speed sensations who
will be a potent factor in the Olym-
pic runnings. A few weeks ago,
the Holy .Cross flash turned in a
quarter on the boards in :49 3-5.
Both Tierney and Fitch are due
for .48 flat on the outdoor cinders.
Very likely Herlihy will also join
this combination. ...	.
The object of Murchison’s eul-
ogy because of the encroauchment
of young stars, is Allan Woodring.
He suspects thatt he old ‘ flashy that
made New York sit up and take no-
tice a few years back still has a
little of the old flame left in him
and may spring a litle surprise at
the Olympic.trials. .. .
’ Notre Dame harbored a 49 sec-
ond man last year in John Mon-
tague, and with the rate of speed
that. is marking McTiernan’s entry
