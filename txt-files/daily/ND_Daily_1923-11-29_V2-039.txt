pus, will appear in this section. 1
An interesting fact concerning
the l924jDome is that each copy
will cost $6.50 to produce. ;
A drive for subscriptions was
started by the Dome, business staff
last night. It is hoped to make the
subscription •; enrollment/ 100 per
cent, ‘ especially among the bff-cam-
pus students, who are said to be
harder to reach than campus men.
.0	drive for $3,000 is be-
ing made. ’ Unlike ’other, years, the
1923 campaign will not be for mem-

nell, Father Desroches. told of his
experiences in the Bengal mission,
in - India; He stated that consider-
able . difficulty., was. experienced . in.
the mission because of the scarcity
of missionaries. . ■	.	'
/ A hother.\db^^
extensive conversion of the natives,;
according to. Father Desroches, is
the apathetic attitude taken against'
the Catholic faith. He related sev-;
eral incidents where conversions
had meant even the breaking ujp of;
families. .
.. He' congratulated the students of
Notre Dame on their commendable!
spirit, ;the; fame of which, he said,;
had. spread even to India. He also.!
thanked the student; body .for its
assistance in maintaining the Cru-
sades, ..and . predicted that Notre

The quadrangle is closed to all
automobiles. Parking spaces are lo-
cated at the rear of the Law build-
ing, near the gym, and on the Door
road. Entrance to the Main build-
ing may be made by driving to the
rear of the building. It is hoped that .
all students will co-operate with the
Department of Discipline in carry-
ing out these regulations. The se-
lection of parking spaces was made
as a result of the congestion caused
by the machines on the quadrangle.

Nine of Knute Rockne’s “Fight-

NOVENABY
BRO. COLUMBA
Sincere: Devotion to the Sacred
Heart; Never Claimed Credit i
. / for Miraculous Cures. . ';
. “Say. five times a day, for ninei
days (ori.more, if not cured), of-;
fering; your prayers ; , through: the;
Immaculate Heart of Mary, and St.;
Joseph: . . . J. ? ; ' : ~	5 ? i
“ ‘Sacred ; Heart of Jesus, cure
me.’; •_	;;
- “/St.. Joseph, pray, for me to,the
Sacred Heart.’” * .	.	•
/. That was the Novena by which
the late Brother Colomba worked
his many marvelous cures. . His de/
vbtion to 'the Sacred Heart and the
many cures' credited to him earned
for him the title, “The Divine Heal-
er of Notre Dame.”, :	. ... i
Another condition of the Novena
soinetimes used, by supplicants was
to wear the Sacred Heart badge,
and to make the Sign of the Cross
with it on the afflicted. part every
day.- ...* .	- '■ . '	.	;
It is. interesting to note. that, the
room in which. Brother Colomba
spent, the last days of his life and
in.which.he.died, was next to that
of the late Brother. Florian. The
two died, it is said, on dates exactly
a’month apart.	, j
-Therej is nothing unusual about
Brother': Colomba’s room .in the
Community house. . A single bed,
a small stand at the head, of; the
bed, a -writing table, a book case
and. several holy pictures—that is
all. But the. very-simplicity of that
room .typifies..his life and death.
He .was simple and sincere in his
devotion zto the Sacred Heart,
never claiming ^credit for the mir-
aculous cu?es 'attributed to him.
He /was. always gentle, always kind-
ly, and uncomplaining in his illness.
.. As one of the good sisters who
attended him put it, “He asked noth-
ing—and. refused nothing. He" was
indeed a. beautiful’ soul.”
BROWNSON
HOLDSSMOKER
---------------- ■ i-
Brother Alphonsos, Fr. O'Donnell
and Fr, Irving Give Talks;
. Four Boxing Bouts, :
Brownson hall held its annual
smoker Tuesday night in Brownson
recreation room - with speeches,
bouts, music, smokes and eats.
Brother Alphonsus, rector of
Brownson hall since 1898, was the
principal speaker. His talk was on
‘.‘Notre Dame Traditions,” especial-
ly those connected with Brownson.
In his talk Brother Alphonsus
ascribed the splendid success of the
Brownson men to two important
factors: ’ Most of the men in the
hall were freshmen who had come
straight from high school, being
therefore in a better position to be
easily moulded into ideal Notre .
Dame men; and second, the disci-
plinary system made real men of
the Brownsonites. He referred to
“Kentucky” Ogerst, John Weibel
and Tom Barber, varsity football
men as typical Brownson men. In
conclusion Brother Alphonsus
thanked the audience and especially
the committee in .charge, for the *
splendid success of the smoker.
Rev. ! Thomas Irving; vice-presi-
dent'of the. University, spoke brief-
ly on the traditional Brownson
spirit, congratulated the -men for
the. notable manner in which they '
had kept the old hall tradition
alive, and brought out the fact that -
a man from Brownson hall has
never been known to have been
brought before the Disciplinary
Board for. any misdemeanor. He
refused-to comment in any-manner- ..--
upon. the great work that Brother
Alphonsus? has done in his 24. years
in Brownson hall, saying that he '
was unable to praise the work of
the beloved rector of Notre. Dame’s
“training ground.”	.	-
Rev. Hugh O’Donnell, prefect of
discipline, briefly affirmed Father
Irving.’s statements in respect to the
brilliant record of the hall,, com-
mented on its athletics and recalled
some of the amusing incidents of
the-past history-of Brownson-
The boxing program,-managed by
Frank Cahill, boxing instructor, was
unusually good. It consisted of

OUR LAST BOW
With this issue the present staff bows to the audience and leaves
. the stage to the new men who from .now on will present their panoramic
production of “The Passing Show i of ’Notre Dame.” . The'new exhib-,
itors will continue on Saturday the performance, that we began last
May and regularly presented until'now. - •:	■
We feel'that the new. men will; do worthy things; they are capable.
. We hope we pleased; we did our best,’ though’ we know that our manne?
: of presentation might have been, success fully’changed, and so, perhaps,
.. improved. The chief stage managers now leaving the stage, are well-
; pleased with what the-supporting/staff. has done in assisting in the
presentation of the story of Notre Danie. 1 They thankfully pat each
man on the back; hoping that all Notre Dairie was as satisfied with thp.
/ work of these aids as they, and they then pass over to the seclusion of
their studies, where, beneath the light shades are tobacco, pipes, pens,
. note-books and many volumes.
’ 'From oiir place bf hermitage, we who'are-passing on, sincerely wish
the new men all luck and all possible success. ,
'	HABITS	.	.. ;
Habits formed early in life are habits that form the later man.
- -_At Notre. Dame, at every-university, men. are now-layingsthe ;foun/
’dation for their failure in 1933.
These are the men supposedly receiving educations fitting-them to;
be leaders. These are the men, at Notre Dame, who are .receiving the
benefits of a higher education under Catholic auspices, who will, it is
. believed, develop, into leaders of thought in the home communities.
. , But these are the men who sleep through Apologetics and Eco-
nomics and in ariy. class when theory is discussed. These are the men
. who loaf through the quarters and- crib their way /to a passing mark.
They are. in the rut of uselessness arid oblivion, the rut . that will
be their, way forever.	-
Unless they get out of it now;'while it can be done.'
From Other Pens
THE HUNT FOR PLEASURE.
Much has been said about the
: mad rush-for. pleasure in America.
All. sorts ■ of .bad .ends have been
prophesied for it from the destruc-
'. tion of the race to the annihilation
: of ‘civilization. ; However,' it must
be recognized that it is only natural
'. for people to. desire pleasure and
. that ,the hunt f or it is only indica-
tive of a healthy mind. z “
The pleasure itself is . the impor-
tant thing as the public itself be-
lieves. Self-constituted critics are
' candidly disgusted with the public
- for ’entertaining this'belief, for they
feel that caste to which the means
of producing the pleasure belongs
is-the important thing. This is the
reason for diatribes against jazz,
. the sentimental-bosh sold as songs,
.and the continual superficiality of
the. movies.-'
It would be a sad commentary,
indeed, if such stuff were indicative
of the intelligence of the nation,
• .but, as a matter of course, it is not
such. The'enjoyment of jazz, ev-
erywhere is not, a matter of the in-
dictment, nor does it indicate that
true:.music .is., being . ‘displaced in
the likes of the people. The utili-
zation of jazz for mere' pleasure
-	. will never result in the displacement
of real music despite all the pes-
simism that may, be. promulgated’in
that regard.. Music is lasting and
enduring,’.'while, jaz^ all that
, . connotes jazz is most .'fleeting of
ephenieralities. .	'
The ‘ popular song of today may
. be on every-tongue‘todaybut a
! month from now it is forgotten. It
. ’ means nothing .‘more than a few
moments of fleeting pleasure, it
makes nd impression,'it has no value
and is . disregarded: as. soon as its
novelty has worn away. The movie,
so much decried, and so much
prophesied as the destroyer of our
sense of reality and worth, lasts its
little hour or two tc- the individual
and . then passes into discard. It
has afforded its brief moment of re-
laxation from cares,' from busiuco^,
from labor, and that was all that
was<desired and all that was ob-
tained.
: The movie, the jazz, arid the pop-
ular song . of' today have no true
value and so cannot live, much less
replace music, drama, and poetic
utterances. These; latter are still
appreciated and iwill. always be.
Hence there is no ground for dole-
ful predictions and bitter railings
against the present generation—

OFF STAGE.
t The night was clear and a large
crowd was. there. The front row
was . surely there. The ma-
chine started a . whirring. . noise
and the crowd cheered, while the
orchestra struck out . bravely; and
drowned out -the. cheering. /The
play was on. .	.	, .'
On the first play Ethel Barry-
more came within two’feet of front
stage but was stopped by Ben-Turr
pin. A dirty look from Turpin to
Monte blue up. Navarro goes in
for Turpim (Here the • feminine
part of the crowd let out a sigh that
was heard in Canopy.) Navarro at-
tempted to drill around the right
end of the stage but was stopped by
the famous Sennett wedge arid two
custard pies. Barrymore, not going
strong, drove through three, lines of
Sunday but that, was all, : there
wasn’t any more. Pickford goes in
for Barrymore. Pickford on, the
next play was awarded first down
by the judges on a fake to Fair-
banks. (All' eyes are on Turpin,
who is expected to go in for a criss-
cross play.) Davies supplants Na7
varro. (Navarro would be mafiori
davies if she’d only bwen moore
picked fords,) , Davies, therefore
playing like a wild cat. The next
play was blocked by Censors. ■ Cen-
sors kicked to Davies who brought
the ball back to within, three reels
of Little Old'New York. But the
drive wrenched Davies’ technique
and Talmadge fills the gap. Censor
again kicks to Pickford, who retali-'
ated with three close-ups. Talmadge'
wild. Talmadge on the next play
tore down the field for 300 feet,-
but was-stopped by Art; Title.- Sen-
nett, acting queerly, sent in Marie

AT THE LA SALLE
"Three Wise Fools,” adopted
from the stage play of .the same
nanie, and playing at the LaSalle
all this week, is an entertaining
moving picture.
It is the story of three old men,
sworn bachelors because of their
common loss of a loved one. Though
they lost the girl, they won her only
child, when dying,, she seeks to
place Sidney in careful hands.
The coming of Sidney, pictured by
them as a young man who would not
like their secluded life, determines
the three to a livelier life, and, that
the young man may have a com-
panion nearer his own age, they
select a nephew, just out of college,
who is coming to make his home
with them.
Sidney,, of course, is not a boy.
She is a fascinating young lady,
and the planned companionship by
the nephew begets then, a bit of
jealousy in the three old hearts.
Th'ere follows complications, the
suspicion that Sidneyds involved in

AT THE ORPHEUM.
“Little Old New York” .is by no
means a great play, and any one
who would be so rash as to proclaim
it a notable"* dramatic achievement
runs grave danger of being taken
up by.the fool catcher. Neither is
Marion Davies a great actress; she
is capable of looking sweet, which
is no fault of hers; she can look
unintelligent, and there isn’t her
fault either, we suppose.
• Mr. Hearst his plenty of money
and he can afford to indulge his
whims, which no doubt accounts for
the fact that “Little Old New York”
was filmed on an ambitious scale
which its value does not demand.
The scenery and sets are excellent
—thanks to the Hearst bank roll-
and to the judicious taste of the di-
rector.
The cast is capable, too, for, re-
gardless of what we have said of
Marion Davies, it must be admit-
ted,, however grudgingly, that'with
good direction her work is efficient,

and this, together with her not al-
together unpleaSing cast of counte-
nance is an aid to' the plot.
The story is old; one;W. Shake-
speare almost worked the girl-who-
masquerades-as-a-boy theme to
death and it has been used once or
twice since his time. The appeal
of the picture rests fundamentally
on the fascination which the early
part of the ninteenth century has
for most Americans. It is, natural-
ly, a costume play, and these, when
done with any degree of artistry at
all, rarely fail.
The supporting cast is uniform-
ly good. Harrison Ford, as Larry
Delavan; Courtenay Foote as Rob-
ert Fulton; Mahlon Hamilton as
Washington Irving; and Louis Wol-
heim, ex-college professor, as the
Hoboken Terror, all give evidence
of the fact that good casts can be
Whatever you want-
style, quality, value—
it’s here
assembled providing the where-
withal is forthcoming. One of the
most amusing moments in the whole
play, and one which one least ex-
pects, is when Washington Irving
climbs into the ring to start off the
fight between the Hoboken Terror
■and Bully Boy Brewster.
If the play does any good at all,
it is because of the pleasing retro-
spect of history it gives, and any-
how, one can’t expect too much for
half a dollar.

After the 50 were selected be-

per cent of these graduates had
: maintained an average of from 90
i to 100 in their four years’ work, 19
per cent had grades of from 85 to

from 85 to 90 per cent.
This correlation between schol-
astic standing and future success
<is worthy of every freshman’s con-

ent, garbed as a woman, but he left
