J. E. House gives us this about
the colyumn. ,
THOUGHTS ON WRITING A
COLYUMN.
Writing a colyumn is a fine job.
It is composed in about equal parts
of' lab or, work and worry. A col-
yumn hound toils and slaves to get
out.his colyumn and then worries
his head off for fear. that, he’ll go
stale and lose his job..
All that is expected of a colyumn
hound is that he. be amusing or
clever in• about 25 or 30.. different,
-ways every day. , A vaudeville per-
former can go. out with ari act and
get it booked ' for 40 /solid? weeks.
The next year he can go over the
same circuit with the same act. ,The
people forget what he said last year
and laugh their heads off at his
stuff. So long as he busts some-
body over the head with something
or sticks his .finger in some one’s
eye the audience ■will howl with
laughter. It doesn’t make any dif-
ference how . many times the audi-
ence has seen him do it. Busting
somebody over the head is laugh-
ter’s principal accessory.
A colyumn hound must have a
new act every day. If he busts
anybody over the head or sticks his
finger into anybody’s eye he gets
the paper in trouble. Most any-
thing is funny on the stage. Very
few things are. funny, in print.
Cold print reveals a man about life
size. If you don’t believe it, go
and listen to a speech by your fa-
vorite rabble-rouser and then try
to read it in cold print. One trou-
ble with a colyumn hound is that
when the stuff doesn’t flow freely
be becomes desperate and tries to
force it. The saddest thing on the
printed page is the forced witticism
or/forced wallop.
Nearly every colyumn hound suf-
fers periodic attacks of a disease
scientifically known . as;; contraction
' of ^the'*beam^During?'t^ese.''attacks
the brain dwindles to the size of. a
half-grown walnut, / its ■ formation
takes on the quality of limestone,
and becomes impregnable to the
■ suggestion of ideas. To a journey-
, man colyumn hound the attacks

...1 <W	news dispatch the. other day that the majority of
Students at. Purdue were disgusted .with the showing their team'made
against Ohio State. In fact, they were so disgusted that the editors of
their, daily paper left a blank column; where the account; of the game
would have appeared. ; Not only that, but they, refused to comment on
the .game < and left another space, on their editorial page.
. That-action, must have indeed injected a lot of encouragement irito
their team, hr'No. doubt. they received a warm welcome when they re-
turned'home; .Purdue has’ a. football team this year that is surely above
the-{average of their teams in the past, but it seems that the students
have lost sight of this fact and are expecting to find an apple, tree

THE WELL ROUNDED EDUCA-
? The-deans {of the. various colleges
' on ;the; hill have .{expressed them-
selves to be in favor ,of:{student
participation in. outside activities.
They give. as\ their reason that such
participation serves to develop the
student greatly and to make for a
well rounded college, education.
Class room work, as the' deans
have added, is of. primary .import-
/ ance and should receive, first con-
sideration at all times. That is
what the student is here for in the
first place. However, the few hours
a week spent in classes and the
hours spent in preparation for-these
classes do not by any means take
all of the student’s time. The de-
sire to utilize-the extra time gave
rise' to extra curricular activities
’ which became: more, and , more va-
'•	' ried in their scope as the university
grew, in size.
While it is, indeed, unpleasant

tions than those of the class room,

ily assumed duties calling one and
that one is free at all tiriies to fol-

includes more, than :the develop-
ment to be obtained in the class
room,’ more than the education to
be obtained- from books. General-
lyspeakirig, a college education is
supposed to consist of a major and
a .minor. - For some this is the case
and for others it consists of' even
.less. But in the main it consists
■in the. development acquired in the
class room and the mental, social,
and physical, development to be ob-
tained from extra-curricular activi-
ties.
Within the activities are to be
•found those students- with a defi-
nite aim in' life, those who repre-
sent-the more ambitious of the stu-
dent body. They are not content
with the . mere absorption of other
men’s ideas but are anxious to learn
by actual experience the value of
their own ideas and thoughts. They
are" not willing to be a slave to
their momentary desires and the
easiest way of spending time. They
learn to know their own' abilities,
to develop their own personality,
and to assume and successfully
discharge responsibilities. ' They
are the students who are obtaining
the most from their college life and
they are the students who will at-
tain the greater successes in later
life.—The Daily Cardirial.

FROM OTHER PENS.
(Continued from Second Column.),
This rebellion against the system
of requirements in the college cur-
riculum and the insistence on the
rights to unlimited class cuts is an
old, old story. It occurs time and
again on every campus, and had it
not occurred at Yale this time, it
would have occurred elsewhere.
Touches of it have been experienced
at our. own university. ‘
Opposition to required courses
began with them. It is made upon
the: grounds that they .are unessen-
tial and limiting; :that the studeni
desirous: of getting an education
does not need theiri arid that they
merely serve; to discourage the un-
ambitious. .’. The;paradox of this is
obvious—a. goal must be set in or-
der to be'attained.
. :The. plea, for elective studies is
.based on the supposition that the
; student should-have- the right to
study those- subjects in which he is
interested. Inasmuch as interest
1 comes only with knowledge, and
since the purpose of college educa-
tion is the broadening, of interests,
such a supposition is utterly out of
place. The average student does
not know in which direction his ten-
dencies lie and. can learn only
through a systematic course. of
study.;
Unlimited class cuts {are out of
the question after the slightest bit
of thought on the subject. The
greater part of the education of
the - average student is obtained in
the class room. To permit unlim-
ited cuts would constitute a serious
loss to the students for advantage
would be taken of them and stand-
ards would necessarily have to. be
lowered because less teaching could
be done. Furthermore, the class
room is the important place for the
student to be.
While unlimited class cuts are
utterly - inadvisable, a departure
from the preserit system of almost
no cuts here is highly to be desired.
A cut from class now and then is
of value“for--the relief that it af-
fords from the monotony of class
attendance and does not do any
harm. It is for this reason that
last spring the Cardinal advocated
Jbhe granting of class cuts ori the
same ’basis' that "grade ’ points^ are
given. Such a system would afford
the student the added impetus > to
better work by' the granting of an
immediate reward.’ 1J;' ? .
Thus, whiled the Yale rebellion in
general is not to: be considered,
certain - points that arouses are
worth careful thought.—The Yale
Cardinal. =	’	' ' ?	'

The title of the current attrac-
tion at the Blackstone is “Does It
'Pay,” and after seein$ it; y°u wil1
probably conclude that it does not.
For the benefit of those who are
not familiar with the plot we will
say that the 'antecedent of the pro-
noun it is divorce.
Hope'Hampton is starred, al-
though why she should be is not
clear; what honors there were m
the picture went to the family law-
yer whose name we unfortunately
do not remember. He resembled
the' photos of* Mr. Rockefeller at
the age of 70, but his work was the
most intelligent of the production.
Robert T. Haines, in the role of the
husband who divorced his wife to
marry the . not so sweet young
thing, depends largely upon shak-
ings of his fist to indicate his right-
eous rage,’ and upon a tender ca-
ressing of his derby to inform the
audience that he has had a com-
plete .nervous breakdown.
. Al Hammond’s White Way Or-
chestra is one of the best organiza-
tions of its kind that has been seen
in South Bend for some time'past.
The specialties of the feminine
member of the company are easily
the .feature of the turn.

“An endowment for needy .foot-

of Utah Agricultural College, .Lo-
gan,, Utah, has been placed at the
disposal of that university. The

mounts into the millions, and “it
— would seem that lack of immediate
resources need’nd longer be a’ bar-
rier to any youngster of tested
football talent who aspires to hon-
' ors on the Big Blue team. In fact
there would seem on the surface to
be no obstacle now to prevent the
. Aggie eleven from maintaining a
place of national distinction, as it
will probably have the pick of the
best talent of this and nearby
states.” „ .	■

No man, it is written, may add a
cubit to his stature by taking

Proved that she can add at least
inches to her stature by taking ex-
ercise. Dr. Mosher shows that the

IRISH PRIMED

AT PRINCETON

Page Has Perfected Peculiar Shift;
Special Train to Carry Indian-
apolis Delegation Here. /
More than the state . champion-
ship is to be decided on Cartier
field; Saturday afternoon when Pat
Page’s Butler eleven meets the
Fighting Irish. The question as to
who is the best halfback in the
Middle West, or rather in the coun-
try; will be settled.’ The battle for
the position is between pur own Don
. Miller and - Zuppke’s fllash, Harold
“Red” Grange.
The conclusion is to be drawn
after .judging comparative scores.
Butler is as strong as Nebraska
because both held the shifty, Illirii
squad to a margin, around 15 .points.
If Notre Daine succeeds in defeat-
ing, :Butler by a bigger score than
did Illinois, then Rockne has the
better, team, and if Don Miller
makes a., greater showing against
Butler than did Grange, then the
Irish''right half , is the better man.
(This is bur own clear reasoning.)
' Pat ‘ Page has perfected a shift
similar.’to that employed by Geor-
gia Tech. It will come with a flank
attack directed at the Notre Dame
tackles. : With Joe Bach and Gene
Oberst in these . forward positions,
it seems that the shift will be used
to no purpose. Butler’s two great
. Backfield stars, Woods and Griggs, *
will start in the game., Griggs has
the, reputation of being one of the
best field goal kickers in the Middle



Perfect interference paves the way for a run by Notre Dame at Princeton.
