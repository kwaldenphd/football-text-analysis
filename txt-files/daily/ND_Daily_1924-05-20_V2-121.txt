v HELPLESS AT PLATE
'Notre Dame added another con-
ference triumph to its string of Big
Ten defeats ^wh'en the Keoganites
defeated'the Minnesota nine 11 to
5 on Cartier field yesterday, after-
noon. The Gophers managed ‘ to
shove five runs across the plate on
loose .fielding and a pair of errors.
Magevney on the mound for Notre
Dame had the Gophers puzzled all
the way.
Notre Dame started the first in-
ning with a crash when Lee on the
mound for the Gophers was touched
for five hits and six runs. Nine
Irish batters faced the visiting twirl-
er. in the opening frame and an
error, a walk, two singles and a
three bagger helped to pile up five
rims. Crowley’s; single scored
Sheehan who got ’on the path
through an. error. Dunne ■ singled
scoring Farrell who had followed
Sheehan with a walk. With , two
men on, Nolan drove one into deep
center scoring Crowley arid Dunne.
Pearson and Magevriey got bn the
bases with a single each and Prend-
ergrast grounded to second where
Magevhey- was' out and Pearson
came home. ,	-	>
Sheehan opened, the second with
a, triple, but was out . at home when
he.tried to. stretch it into a homer.

BALL AT PALAIS ,
ROYALE IS CLIMAX OF
WEEK AT N. D.
After four long years, of wait-
ing, the class of 1924 has reached
the delightful climax of its college
career, the Senior Ball.
Beginning with the Notre Dame-
Minnesota baseball game yesterday
afternoon, and the informal dance
at the Oliver hotel last evening, at .
9 o’clock, the Senior Ball will con-
tinue until the last strain of music
at the dance to be held after the
theater party Saturday night.
- Ball week officially opened at the
informal dance last night. Although
all of the guests were not in South
Bend, a. fair crowd ■was present to
commence the activities of the
week.
Tonight there will be a formal
dinner dance at 1 the Oliver, for
which the services of Charlie .Davis
and his orchestra have* been secured^.
Mr. Davis has the reputation of
possessing thev finest dance orches-
tra in Indiana, and its appearance
at this function will add greatly to •
its attractiveness. The committee
in charge has made arrangements /
whereby the tables will be so placed
that there will be plenty, of (room
for dancing. . . 1	'	.: ;

PALACE-1—“Phantom Justice.”
. . It is practically apparent that the American legislators are bent on
excluding the Japanese from this country, in spite of President Cool-
idge’s action, signifying his desire for them to act in a contrary manner.
;The members of the House and Senate who have, so strongly supported
' the Japanese “exclusion measure” base their discriminating action not
■ only on the argument that our social; our economic, and dur industrial
institutions will be severely injured by the influx of cheap labor, like
/some persons do, but upon an argument that is motivated by patriotism.
• Even such men like Senator Lodge, who previously had joined Presi-
dent Coolidge and Secretary Hughes in opposition to the proposal of
exclusion, are in .favor of it, and they do not hestitate to state that their
_ _• •L_j.cliange.bf .attitude-was-brought-about/primarily ?because-of—Ambassador;
Hanihara’s threatening note to our government, in which he undiploma-
tically spoke -of “grave; consequences”, -jvhich would necessary follow
/should.-the “exclusion policy” be adopted.
• Editorial comment in a Chicago newspaper characterizes this ac-
tion on the part of the American government as. a new declaration
of /American independence, not less significant and epochmaking for
America and the/world than the declaration of 1776.; It certainly
has taken on'the aspects of /an international precedent similar to
the declaration made in Independence Hall one hundred and forty-
eight years ago and, the Monroe ; Doctrine policy in 1823, and the
responsive, patroitic action ,of our statesmen is to be commended, in
so far as their patroitism was challenged by the absence of an, ex-"
elusion bill; but .have these same statesmen let the emotional surge
.of their .patroitism stifle their powers of 'reason?. Have these gentle-
men fully, determined whether or not America, with her ever-increasing
number of industries, and .her gradual- assumption of leadership, in
the industrial spheres, will need "the assistance of these foreigners;
have these men? first; made provisions to check the practices of im-
migranti smuggling which have grown so steadily that more persons
are smuggled into this country than are permitted toenter in /accords
' -ance-with the/immigration quota; and'lastly, have these men fully
■analyzed the-factions back of this exclusion, movement to determine
whether or not some group is the sponsor of it, in the hopes of some day
excluding'all foreigners, especially Catholic foreigners? Sinister in-
fluences are everywhere at work in this country trying to undermine
. . the principles . and structures that have made this nation so great
and powerful. We, and; our' represqntatives, must examine- them
closely, because a disguise need not always be of a peculiar nature.
. - ; A FAIR CLAIM BUT POOR BUSINESS.
Conrad Nagle and Aileen Pringle

ABSURDITIES TO BE REPEATED
I During graduation week, the
Monogram, club will again present
the famous “Absurdities of 1924”
which made such a big hit several
months, ago. . All 'monogra'm men
.are asked to be present (next Tues-
!,day evening in Washington hall for
{the. first rehearsal. '
, - ' The story-is told by. a . young woman that she recently purchased
. . a- pair of. satin slippers in a department store for $6. She took
. , the slippers home and tried them on but decided that she did not
like, them;,and J took them back to the store^ asking a return of her
- money . Tlie^ manager' gave , her $5.70/saying that the 30 cent deduc-
tion was'. 5.	\
This is an unusual story ^because; few, business: houses : make a
'deduction when;goods are returned. No doubt it did cost this store
, manager 30- cents;, probably a whole lot more, for the service given
\in7supplying1this/woman with slippers. -First, of all there was the
•clerkfto^waif on/her,’then there was the boy in the wrapping room,
:ahd ithej girl -who -niakes - change. And' when she brought them back
, . there'’was- tlie lady fat the exchange desk. All of . them must-be paid.
'	‘^^"Hiaps this store manager figures his1 cost so close, that it must
- /he *a Vaslf transaction, in order that? he may make a fair profit. ; His
30 cent deduction may have been’ a most necessary one, and yet he
-w.ilL-.lose.- money:; by this policy. \ / The same storekeeper might have
added a dime to the selling price of those slippers and thus: dis-
/ tribute the burden of. service charge for Returns and exchanges, arid-
he would probably' never have offended a customer. / On the other
. ’ hand, he chose to assess the added cost’ on the person causing it
Just a little thing, and yet 'that incident undoubtedly cost him a
customer/and a lost customer is a lost profit.
Which only illustrates that the little things are the important
things in.business.. ,.	, . -	! ■	r ,

the members.
Heretofore the Santa Maria was
issued quarterly, but because the
council.felt that The Daily was car-
ing sufficiently for the detailed ac-
counts of the happenings of each
meeting, the Santa Maria was made
an annual, chronicling the events of
the year. '

Juggler’s Last Issue
Promised .Next Week
The Juggler will make its final
appearance of the present schol-
astic year -with the Commencement
'number which will .be ready for
distribution the latter part of next;
^week. Dan Hickey, editor in chief
of the publication, is determined to
get the Juggler out before Decor-
ation Day.
The material handed in to date
has been exceptionally good, and
gives promise to another splendid'
number. Many of the contributions
have come from the pens and type-
writers of former well-known stu-
dents of the University. It is rum-
ored that the Commencement num-
ber will in all probability be as
large as the decent Girls’ number.

lowa Gets Revenge
on Notre Dame; 3-2
By the margin of one point, the
University of Iowa baseball nine
took revenge on Notre Dame for
the bitter defeat last season and
. the Irish suffered their first confer-
ence loss to Coach Sam Barry’s
team 3 to 2 on Cartier field Tues-
day. The tilt almost duplicated the
' game of last season as a pitchers’
battle. Gus Stange on the mound
for the Irish twirled excellent ball
for the Blue and Gold while Fab7
ricious hurling for Iowa retained
his effectiveness throughout the
game.
Hard hitting was- lacking but hits
were not infrequent, Iowa gather-
ing eight bingles for their credit
| while Notre Dame found the visit-
j ing moundsman for seven. Notre'
J Dame started out with a rush scor-
! , ing two runs the first inning while
5 • Iowa rode through four innings
j without getting much of a chance
| to score. The Notre Dame fielders
j -were crowding their pitcher with
!	support and the odds were leaning
j	toward the Blue and Gold for an-
: other conference victory.
Sheehan and .Nolan brought in
. the first two counters being assisted
i around the path by , timely hits.
For the next three, innings the
pitchers decided the game and both
। men used a change of pace to good
advantage. Scanlon opened the
fifth for Iowa with a single that
started the rampage good for one
score. Barrett, singled helping
Scanlon to third and Fabricious
went to third when he was hit with
a pitched ball. King’s bunt caught
Scanlon on the homeward path, but
Silver’s wild peg to third allowed
Scanlon to get' home.
Notre Dame had az good chance
to score in thesixth if one of the
j Blue and Gold batsmen could have
hit when a hit meant a run. A
' walk and a hit had put Nolan and
Dunne on the path. Silver came
----.	flied -to —Scanlon" and
1 Pearson hit an infield roller to Fab-
ricious who elected to get Nolan
coming home. With Dunne on'third,
■ Prendergrast grounded out.
Iowa counted again in the sixth
when Hicks connected with the only
long hit of the day, a hard drive
into center; giving him a pass to

Iowa and Wisconsin will be hard
games, and No^re Dame will have
to present an offensive power equal
to the Hawks and the Badgers .if

will not be diminished in the least
when the Hawks play on their own
grounds.’. Wisconsin displayed un-
usual strength in defeating Illinois
but succumbed to the attack of the
Boilermakers. z
' Coach Sam Barry will probably
draft Duhm, the Iowa ace, for
mound^ duty against Notre Dame.
When . Michigan beat Iowa, last
Monday afternoon, 3 to 2, Duhm
staged a pitcher’s duel wtih Benson
of the Wolverines. The Hawkeye
hurler held the 'situation well in
hand throughout the game except
for the sixth, when timely hits and
an error allowed Michigan to shove
three runs across., the plate. The
encounter with1 the Badgers. will
find the Irish just returning from
Iowa with little time for rest and
no time for practice.

THE CONSTITUTION
of the Student Activities Council of the University of Notre Dame
ARTICLE ONE
, Name
This organization shall be known
as the Student Activities Council of
the University of Notre Dame.
ARTICLE TWO
Objects
The objects of the Students Ac-
tivities Council shall be:
1.	To provide an effective chan-
nel of communication between the
undergraduate body and the Uni-
versity authorities.'
2.	To exercise a general super-
vision over student activities, or-
ganizations, traditions and customs.
3.	To crystalize and make ef-
fective the sanest of undergraduate
opinions.
ARTICLE THREE
Powers
SECTION 1. - (Enumeration).
The powers of the Student Activi-
ties Council shall be legislative, ex-
ecutive and judicial. These powers
shall be exercised during the aca-
demic year, exclusive of the sum-
mer session.
SECTION 2.	(Legislative). The
Student Activities Council may as
it sees fit makes rules and regula-
tions, affecting organizations, cele-
brations, student customs, cere-
monies, entertainments, general
elections and all other matters di-
rectly pertaining to student activity-
• f z
The Student Activities Council
may make rules and regulations
■ concerning the general behavior of
the student body except insofar as
regulations now or hereafter. be
provided by University authorities.
SECTION 3.	(Executive). The
--Student-Activities- Council -v-shallr
with the co-operation of the under-
graduate body, make provisions for
the administration .of its rules and
• regulations.
The Student Activities Council
may exercise jurisdiction, over
games and contests not under the
control of the Athletic Board.
The Student Activities Council
shall have power to authorize solic-
iting, canvassing and collecting on
the University campus. Enforce-
ment of this power, shall reside with
the Council.
SECTIONS. (Judicial). Upon
written request of the president of
the University, or of the dean of
any department, or of any faculty
member acting through the dean of
• his department, the Student Activ-
ities Council may make an investi-
gation into any matter of concern
to student life. Report on such in-
vestigation shall be in writing with
or without recommendation as 4the
request shall have, stated. This
clause shall not be interpreted to
mean that the. granting of a request
for an investigation, as provided by
this clause, shall be mandatory.
Upon written request of any stu-
dent or any group of students, the
Student Activities Council may sub-
mit for the consideration of the
University authorities such recom-
' mendations as the Council shall
deem warranted.
In arriving at a decision in. any
case arising under. Section 4, Arti-
cle III, the. Student Activities Coun-
cil may delegate its judicial power
to a committee of six students.
When the Council shall, decide to
delegate its power in this manner,
it shall be the privilege of the pres-
ident of the Council to request each
class president to submit in writing
the names. of two men from his
class who shall constitute a panel
from which the Council shall select
by vote six men. These six men
shall sit as a jury to hear the facts
in the case and decide the issue
which is at stake. But no person
interested in the case individually
or interested in the issue at stake
shall be eligible to serve as juror.
Unless otherwise provided, report
from such a jury shall be submit-
ted to the Council in "writing. '
I " No student council can function effectively unless it truly rep-j
I resents the student body. Nor can-it properly perform its work un-j
| less it enjoys at all times the confidence of the students. No student:
j council can justify existence by a single act; nor is a single failure an I
? indication of incompetence. In order that student government may 1
:succeed two things are essential: first, a realization on the part of I
ithe students that there is a field in which such a council can for the |
I good of the University act effectively; secondly, a willingness on the j
| part of the University authorities to grant as much freedom of action j
j to the council as is consistent with order and discipline. Confidence:
j on rhe part of the faculty and co-operation from the students will 1
|make of a student council what it is intended to be and what it should I
I be—a powerful good in all departments of student life.	J
ARTICLE FOUR

bers). The. Student Activities
