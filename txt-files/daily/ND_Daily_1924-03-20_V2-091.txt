Oh,, gentle reader, have, you ever
stayed up half the night to prepare
a duty for your early class, then
rjse at dawn (or, more exactly, at
§ to 8) for the Eight o’clock, only
to find that the professor fails to
meet- your class? Alas, alack,
such are the trials: and tribulations
of college—between Quarterlies. •

And the only thing, that broke
the monotony of St. Patrick’s Day
Was the arrival of trains from Chi-
cago and elsewhere, bearing back
students to the fount of knowledge.
My scouts arid mere tale-tellers re-
late. many stories of the week-end
pertinent facts connected with the
in the Windy City. Rather than
weary you ; again with details I
will suppress all but some rather
pertinent facts corinected .with "the

Perhaps you noticed that the last
issue of a certain, humorous month-
ly publication' on . the campus; was
proclaimed .7 the Movie Number.
Somehow .the news must’ have
reached Chicago, for in the window
of Buck and, Rayner’s biggest loop
drug store-there reposes a huge
sign. Across its top it makes bold
to say HOLLYWOOD LIGHTS!
And there (just/'above the studio
name, with “$1.00 each”) reposes
the photo;of some hero, thoughtful-
ly posed, in a .white . shirt, quite
open at the :neck. Who? Why,
none other, than .that connoisseur,

Discusses Supper
.At. a general meeting ■ of the
Junior .Prom committee ;held yes-
terday noon in the Journalism room
of the library, the question of
whether there'should be aT supper
managed by some group of indi-
viduals not officially connected with
the class, or whether the entire mat-
ter should be left to individual dis-
cretion, was threshed out. John
Moran, president of the class, and
George Sheehe, opposed . the plan
of a supervised supper/ As the sen-
timent appeared to be about evenly
divided, the settlement of the mat-
ter was postponed.
Prom tickets . are about gone,
and tickets that are being held for
friends, by class members will be
put: in the hands of one man after
tomorrow. The ticket committee
warns especially those who are

Father Albertson
Delivers Sermon
Rev. George Albertson, C. S. C.,
delivered an interesting- and in-
structive sermon on “Idleness” at
the regular semi-weekly Lenten de-
votions held in the Sacred Heart
Church at 7:30 last night. The
usual benediction and other ser-
vices followed the sermon.
Father Albertson in his talk on
“Idleness” stresed .the great loss of
time that this vice, causes to . the
world - and . especially to • students, j
The loss of grace was also empha-
sized. The third point brought out
by Father Albertsori' was the loss' of
opportunity for which idleness was
directly responsible. In develop-
ing his point he metioned as exam-
ples the lives > and- accomplishments
of such men-as Louis Pasteur,,.the
noted Frenchman, and Dr. John B.
Murphy of Chicago,.who was one of
the greatest surgeons and scientists
of his times.	7 7

Protest of Freshman Hall Overruled
by Athletic Board; Events Were ;
Run Off in Record Time.
Rev. John ,C Devers, C. S._ C!,
rector, of Carroll hall and the
chairman of the; .faculty board of
interhall athletics, announced last
night that the championship and
and/.subsequently the Bill Roach
trophy .cup in interhail relays have
been won by Sophomore hal. The
victor, in the interhall, race could
not be definitely arinounced before,
owing to a protest entered by
Freshman hall against the winners;
regarding , a contest that later de-
cided ;the title. ;	7 '
. The ■, following, . i according to
Father Devers, is the story of the
protest: Inuring the progress of
the season at the time of the sched-
uled Freshman-Cadillac race, the
Cadillac team was unable to place
a full tearii in the contest ,and so
they failed to put in their appear-
ance at the appointed time. Sopho/
more hall had its relay team in the
gymnasium, at the "time that the
Freshman-Cadillac race was To
start.’ The Frosh runners then in-
vited the Sophomore team to replace
the missing Cadillac contestants. '
Sophomore accepted this invita-
tion and the race was held in place
of the one scheduled. In the fol-
lowing contest Sophomore won and
counted the race as a regular sched-
□led engagement in so far as all trie
necessary requirements had been
fulfilled. - Freshman riall objected
to this race and entered a protest.
Both’ the faculty board of athletics |
and the interhall athletic commit-'
tee ■ agreed that Sophomore had a
clear title, to the race and that
Freshman hall’s protest should Be
disregarded. 1	!
In winning the relay title, Father
Gassensmith’s proteges have ex-
celled-. in? what is probably. trie best
field of interhall teams triat haye
been, produced in recent years. Trie
entire race was uncertain from the
start, as different hall teams threat-
ened at times to capture the laurels.
The record for the .seasori was
slashed at practically every series
of tile events as the season pro-
gressed. ;	:,yy.	,

Leroy’ Hibbert opened the ' prd-
grani with a short reading’ frorii
the ‘“Merchant of 7 Venice.” ; The
reading was excellent arid received
a good deal of applause. The next
thing on the bill was, a^ one-act skit
which: was • named . the : “Land; of
Promise.”, The cast consisted; of
Jake Zeller, Tom McKiernan and
Jack Flynn. Zeller was especially
clever in the-rendering of his part.
This play will be offered at the car-
nival' in April, and ’is; trie work of
Prof. Reynolds; director of the club.
When the entertainment was over
the business matters were'discussed.
The first thing that the club'did was
to - pass a resolution’ ’favoring the

way to class. No bands played the
national airs of old Erin, no dele-
gation of ex-bartenders headed rhe
parade, yet the day .was celebrated
in a novel manner at Notre Dame. '
It seems .somewhat strange. that
one of our neighbors, the Univer-
sity of Illinois, should have such a
celebration. They have not been
headlined in every sport page of
the country as the Fighting Irish,
yet on the feast day of that saint
Champaign and Urbana seems to
have been filled with the spirit of
Ireland. Yet at Notre Dame the
cafeteria kings were the only ones
that splurged their green.
U T : “ALL ROADS LEAD TO—”	'
‘	• When huge Ixnilders and camouflaged kneeling benches were pladed
at the two. important entrances fo the quadrangle; we thought the
.problem,of-automobile traffic;.at Notre Dame was solved.1 Two weeks
of observation show; that it. is’not. j The blockade was only a half-way-
measure. The-entrances were blocked but no means for enforcing this
blockade. has beenr adopted. Instead of using the roads which were
built for tKe purpose, autompbilists! now cut away from these roads and
•gp/plowing across\ fields/across the campus, around trees, cutting up
footpaths^ and digging deep ruts—pbserve the corner at the'off-campus
.office, the >post. office, the northwest corner of Sorin Hall, etc., etc.
vi These-new' roads are not the 'only ones that are being made, and
perhaps this enforced blockade; has’something to do with it. Freshman
and • Sophomore-halls are now. reached by taxicabs late at night, not '
1 By the Cartier Field road, but by means!of the concrete walks that wind
- around 'the Main Building and. Washington hall to: the edge of the
-;Fresh-Soph../campus. This section has become a speedway fdr late
taxicabs. This is dangerous as well as destructive.. If this blockade
pf, automobiles is to be a strict one, more drastic measures should be
adopted/to,.see that, drivers do. not make new roads where new roads
;are not wanted.. wit certainly would be better to remove the'boulders
and iron barriers. every evening and allow the automobilists to use the
old roads,, especially if/.the beauty of our campus, and our own safe
pursuit of knowledge, is to be endangered by this protection which, it
appears^ is -only'a half-protection at the best!
HIGH-HATTED IGNORANCE f
’ ■ \ In that pidps work commonly , attributed to Thomas a. Kempis,
‘‘The Imitation of Christ,” there are. many striking thoughts; and the
‘one we. quote.,is .most, appropriate here and at this time, since we are
college-men and the season;is the holy period of Lent.
v .‘/Therefore;be. not lifted up;by any skill or knowledge that, thou
hast;.ibut rather^fear concerning the knowledge which is given to thee.
-If it seemeth to thee that thou knowest many things, and understandest
them well,, know also that there.;are many more things which, thou
’ knbwest not. 1-Be not high-minded, but rather confess thine ignorance.”
not High-minded”-^-in bur mundane idiom, gentlemen, be not
high-hatted. ’
'T' The pill,is father a bitter one:for.college men to swallow. We are
at'that age .when one first ! realizes his powers, possibilities, and his
general .puissance in dealing with life. Add to this youthful estimate a
tgood/social, positionj leisure, flattery, and. money earned by someone
else,: and the ..combination, appears asi formidable to the cultivation of
/that virtue in which so many other are contained—/Humility. .
It surely seems to the college man that he “knowest many things.”
rWhat he fails tb know is that he doesn’t know anything. (That state-
.ment is purposely strong, for our mutual benefit; if we said the college
- man doesn’t know everything, the instinctive reply would be, “Of course
' noty/but who .wants to know everything? What we'know is what the
' best -people should know”).
.' ;/’We/repeat, the average college man doesn’t lenow anything. He
"has jideas,;^opinions,,.instincts, but in nine cases out of ten he has not
put . these, to/, the test of experience. And he will probably, not have
, put..them; to the; complete test until he has passed middle, age. What
he now thinks he knows will have to .be through the fire-of experience
■ .beforesit becomes knowledge, certainty.	'.	’	.
If you grant that-—and if you are the average college man you
iwill grant it but not believe it—there is a rather obvious conclusion:
> Try out your ideas and test/your judgments; The best way to deter-
/ mine; what your complete theory of life should be is to try out a theory
; of living. After that,.pray for two things—a conscience to sit in judg-
: ment' on- these .theories, and “a. will, to' execute t the commands of con-
!'science.’
■' 1 We intended to urge Humility—and perhaps we have, after all.

Illinois Infidels Wear Much Green on St. Pat’s
Day, But the Fighting Irish Shun their Colors
St. Patrick’s day has passed into
the vague and misty past at Notre
Dame without any of the customary
glamour and celebrations that have
often characterized that glorious
day in the past. It slipped by like
any of the ordinary class days,
with scarcely a hint of what might
have been.
Some of the “Fighting Irish” it
is true, blossomed forth with the
customary assortment of ties,
shirts, ribbons and socks in ..vary-
ing degrees of green,. ■ Even the
usual array, of shamrock, pipes, and
other reminders of the. “old sod”
were in evidence as the day pro- j
gressed. Colonel Hoynes and a few
other / of . the Irishmen about the
campus did their bit to celebrate the
greatest of all days for the Emer-
ald Isle.
The Irish of Notre Dame held a
parade on the campus, in harmony
with the general - spirit of p'oees-
sions that were simultaneously fill-
ing the streets of the big cities of
the nation. But the parade of the
Fighting Irish was short and some-
what. disconnected, as it was brok-
en into many subdivisions in all di-
rections. The Irish were on their
. The following is the editorial
that appeared on St. Patrick’s day
in the Daily Illini:
St. Patrick’s Day And-^—
. Yesterday was St. Patrick’s -day.
All the Irish lads and lasses on the
campus—and many who were far
from, being even of the most remote
Irish descent—dragged out the
shamrock, the green ribbons, neck-,
ties, shirts/ dresses, skirts, socks,
stockings, raincoats, umbrellas and

sainted day. •
Down on the corner of Wright
and Green streets, “the busiest col-
lege corner in the world,” a stolid,
silent German parade in a green tie.
To have seen the broad walk pa-
rade one would have thought that
this is an Irish university. A Jap-
anese ^student walked with an
American student, rather self-con-
scious 'and embarrassed under the
spreading glory of a large green
shamrock. The American student
wore an orange tie. , ■
A Russian stiideht walked un-
consciously along in a jgreen shirt,
accompanied by a Filipino student,
under the influence of a green rib-
bon. And of course all the fra-
ternity freshmen were there cele-
brating with bells on.
St. Patrick’s day parties that have,
been raging in our. society world
ever since Valentine’s day came to
an end last night gave way to Eas-
ter parties, and even May Day par-
ties.
The climax , of it all came, imme-
diately after dinner , when , the
chimes came to life for the occasion
and pealed out a full program of
Irish airs. The campus heard and
wondered if the chimester might
not be none other than a loyal son
of Erin. . . .

________ ' 1
Editor, The DAILY:	’
A spirit of antagonism so fre-
quently exists between pupil and
teacher that it is supposed by many *
of us to be a necessary condition..
Too often do we find this to be the
case in our own school. Especial-
ly is it felt by the freshmen. Com-
mittee members have often reported
that when freshmen have, repeated-
ly failed in their work, and have
been asked whether they have told
the professor of the difficulty, in-
variably they reply in the negative
and manifest surprise that a prof
could be used in such an emergency.
Upper classmen, too, seem to
have the idea that a prof is nothing
more than a monitor or a jailor
hired at public expense to make life
a burden for the. student. We are
fortunate in having, a fine faculty,
and for the most part a very sympa-
thetic one. Instead of waiting for
the instructor to find ’ by a long
quizzing process , that we are not
measuring up to the standard set for
us, how much more sensible would
it be for us to approach the prof
with our real difficulties, get them
squarely before him and let him
lead us out of our difficulty.
There is entirely too much of the
idea of “getting by” or /‘putting
something over” on the prof. / We
are prone to feel if he omits the'
portions of the lesson which we do
not understand, we are fortunate.
It is .entirely possible, that missing
a clear understanding of these
points may be a serious handicap to
our further success in that particu-

At the Orpheum
This is another chronicle by
. Tarkington, chief . scribe of the
court of King Boy. “Boy of Mine”,
is easily as amusing and clever as
Penrod, and other stories of the
same type by this author.*
This time it is a story of a boy
whose father is incapable of under-
standing his trials and tribulations.
Tarkington’s clever pen attributes
a terrific importance to various
' small incidents, but he succeeds in
hiding this exaggeration so com-
pletely that one is unconscious of
it.
It is a wholesome and very en-
joyable movie. Ben Alexander is
the1 star, and plays his part with re-
markable understanding and real
ability. The parts of the mother
and father are filled by Irene Rich
and Henry Walthall. . The cast also
includes Rockcliffe Fellowes.
It is a story of laughs, chuckles,
smilesfand a few tears, a play that
is, in our estimation, worth seeing.

ON THE LEVEL
By LARRY KELLY
Walter Eckersall, dean of mid-
dle-western sport writers, has this
to say'about Bob Regan:
Bob ■ Regan, the former. Notre
Dame lineman, who goes to Utah as
assistant coach, is generally ac-
corded one of the .best forwards in
the history...of football at the fa-
mous Hoosier. institution by Coach
Rockne and-others who have seen
him perform. . / During his college
days he-/was "a .fast .charger and
was. the., center of attack of most
.of Notre Dame’s line plays. He
jwas a good blocker and a strong
.defensive-player.- •	/
/ Coach Rockne has often said he
‘was about the: best lineman he ever
had covering punts, and during his
Splaying, days J made, as many tackles
as the-ends while covering his pant-
hers’ kicks. '. . "
’ Regan is a student of football,
,'knows the game, and, according .to
Rockne, knows how to teach it.

Tom Sayers, of Brighton, Eng-
land, and John Heenan, of Benecia,
j California,-met ih the most memor-
■ able ■ battle; in”:the " annals. of the
Yesined arena. This heavyweight
• contest for a diamond belt emblem-
matic. of .the. championship of the
'woi’id and 1000’ pounds a side. The
fight was held in a time when prize-
fighting in nearly all countries was
declared a felony. In those ancient
:days the nation whose J fighter
.proved proved the best was declared
' '-the strongest nation in so far as
her subjects were concerned, not
."only as to their real physical sub-
istance, but as* to their skill, en-
;/lurance and genuine courage.
Thus the people of the two na-
tions went almost frantic over the
„ bout. Rivalry was at fever heat
/and the people of this country
waited with anxiety for th enews of
z the battle. That was in the 'days
• before the Atlantic cable and the
■news from England had to come by
; steamship.	■
Thousands waited on the; wharves
. of this side and every ship that
" "came in was surrounded by crowds
’ /eager to learn how the fight came
out. '	■	,
~ : Sayers , and Heenan fought on
the turf with their bare knuckles and
;'the fight lasted 42 rounds—two
■hours and twenty minutes. At the
-opening of the 43rd round the
American, had the Britisher in a dis-
tressing plight;and a mob of toughs
rushed into the ring and the.battle
. was declared a draw. The toughs
broke up the fight to save their
Hets, one way or another. Both
. men were terribly "disfigured. .	;•
- i After the fight, the English <peo-
/ple rose as one to do honor to the
ipugilists. At the Alhambra theatre
-in London, each was presented with
:.a magnificent belt and the speaker
who introduced them to (the audi-
? ences said that they-; were/the; brav-'

This historic battle resembles the
one betwen John L. Sulivan, the
“Boston strong boy,’’ and Jake Kil-
rain. , These two men fought 75
rounds with bare knuckles in a ring
pitched; on the outskirts of Rich-
burf, Miss., .in 1889. Sullivan was
awarded the victory.
Dan Hickey,. veteran manager of
Paiil Berlenbach, asserts Paul’s de-
feat at the hands of Jack Delaney
would give renewed stimulus to the
former amateur’s ring career. Con-
fidence is one of the requisites es-
sential to a boxer and a kayo, such
as Delaney administered to Berlen-
bach, generally destroys this asset.
It is evident that Berlenbach was
rushed to fast. He appeared like
a novice before the smart general-
ship and accurate punching of the
Bridgeport middleweight. His
footwork was poor. and. he was un-
able to protect himself. Perhaps
Berlenbach’s handlers were too mer-
cenary and not satisfied with the
$1,000 which Tex Rickard^ was giv-
ing Paul for each fight.
Berlenbach’s case; is similar to
that of Bobby Barret, the Phila-
delphia lightweight.. Barrett start-
ed off by kayoing a good number of
his opponents. His handlers were
greedy and. instead of leading him
gradually to a championship title,
they matched him with Lew Tend-
ler after he had been in the ring
only six months. Tendler gave Bar-
rett a drubbing and never since has
Bobby-been fired with the fighting
spirit that may have won him the
crown.	-	'
Now that Dempsey has called
off his bout with . Tommy Gibbons,
he will enter the movies where: a
cinema contract will keep him busy
until some time in July.
