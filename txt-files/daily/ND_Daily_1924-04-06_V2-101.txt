The “Notre Dame Life” Section of the
Dome Is New Feature of Year Book
STARS FOR DEPAUW
The “Notre Dame Life” section
of the 1924 Dome promises to be a
unique method of depicting the
year’s^events in pictures. Beginning
with registration lines and the
confusion of frantic freshmen seek-
ing rooms and advice, and ending
with commencement and leave tak-
ing, this section carries the read-
ers through all the happenings of
the year. . ■•'	•
Well-arranged snapshots of the
football team in action, tracing the
history of the season through the
early training period, through the
games both at home and on foreign
fields, and through the scenes of
meeting and cheering the team, are
of particular merit. Homecoming,
with the returning grads, the new-
ly uniformed band, the barbecue,
and the game, is cleverly portrayed.
Not only is the football season
colorfully illustrated, but many
pages are devoted to intimate
scenes of campus life. Pictures of
the basement chapel, of the “cam-
pus beautiful” under winter and
spring skies, and’of the Ball, the
Prom, the Cotillion, and the Frolic,
are included in this new feature of
the Dome.

tional Intercollegiate meet last

came to the front in the ranks of
middle-west track stars when he
won the all-around championship in

afternoon, the teams listed third
on.the 'schedule playing on the Car-

the monogram wearers. Handing :
finished the quarter mile in :53 3-5.
Gephardt threw the discus 116

the time iri all the events was be-
low standard." John Wendland and i

respectively in the'two mile, which
the Irish star won in 10:25.	"

What Others Say
On Good Friday
Nobody questions the fitting- re-
spect paid to the memory of a great
national figure, when at the time of
his interment, flags are struck and
the wheels of industry halt for a
reverential minute. The nation
which, nominally at all events, is a
Christian nation, pauses in the rush
of trade and commerce and the
day’s labor, to reflect on the pass-
ing of greatness. Each year, on
Good Friday, there is occasion to
pay tribute, to the memory of the
death that transcends all other
leaths of God or Man. Throughout
the British Empire the day is made
a holy day. To all Christians, ev-
erywhere, it should be holy without
the legal aid of civic authority.
That is why the movement of coun-
cils of the Knights of Columbus,
originating in San Francisco, to
have a period of solemn remem-
brance observed by all on Good
Friday, is a movement that com-
mends itself, not only to councils
of the order everywhere, but to all
Christian men who know—and
what practical Christian doesn’t
know?—the crucial significance of
Good Friday in the Christian cal-
endar.—Columbia.

COLLEGE DAYS, by Stephen
Leacock; Dodd, Meade and Com-
pany, New York. $1.25.
What^with “Behind the Beyond,”
“Over the Footlights,” and “Non-
sense Novels,” not to mention “My
Discovery of England,” Stephen
Leacock is in some danger of be-
coming a national institution.
Certainly his ventures in humor
have brought him more fame than
would have come to the author of a
prosaic text on Political Economy.-
Like most men who have acquired
an audience, Mr. Leacock has pro-
ceeded to turn his earlier work to
account, and in “College Days” we
have a sheaf of essays which have
appeared in various publications
during the past 20 years. It is a
Leacock in a somewhat different
mood, in a mood much the same as
that displayed in “My Discoveries
of England.” Since he is Stephen
Leacock, the thing to say is that he
is as humorous, as ever—it is plati-
tudinous to say that a humorist is
never taken seriously. Here and
there, however, through his usual
drift of nonsense, appears a mo-
mentous truth, and an attempted
arraignmerit of coritemporaneous
education, the justice of which you
may dr may not agree with.

• .’America. is . a: land where hugeness and wealth are gods. . It is a
land that measures accomplishments with a yard-stick or a bushel
basket, a land the spirit of which is illustrated by the popularity of
The American Magazine. Its representative city is Chicago; the
material capital of America. It is a city of action, restless, surging,
crushing, chaotic.. It is a city of noise, uproar, clamor, rumbling, bangs,
screeches, howls, shrieks. It is a city of commerce, announcing the
economic ..interpretation of civilization, boasting of the largest, grain
market, the greatest meat market, the mariimoth’ producers of cement,
' clothing, furniture, stoves, pianos, telephone apparatus, and so on,
boasting.of “the greatest .negro settlement outside of Africa”; “the
. most disastrous" fire of' modern- times” ;- “the mosb?congested -street corr
ner in the world” ; “more litigation per capita than any other city in
the world”; “one of its dirtiest, drabbist, -most miserable, most ram-
/ shackle'streets is—20 miles long!”
It is a.city‘.of size—representing America.	-
So Jay ’ William Hudson paints it in his story of “Nowhere Else
in the World,”, and we who,. in college, are idealists, and believe suc-
cess, is. something spiritual, not material, that quality not quantity is
important,- are led. to wonder.	-
- We wonder of this spirit, because it is new, which most. of. us
now oppose,' arid to whizch many of us will succumb, as did Hr. Hud-
son^ hcro/is revolting only because it is new. Perhaps there is more
in 'niateriai results than we think, that, although spiritual ends are most
im^ortantj here, on a material planet, we wonder if material results
are. not as adequate expressions'of a real civilization as the arts; and
if, which is by the way, Rotarian, and Lion club banquets are not to be
laughed at, but are to be rejoiced in as signs of a healthy,'optimistic
America, fatuous, smug,' often mistaken, but actively progressing
* toward a .riew kind of spiritual life that expresses itself not in ortho-
dox paintings, literature, and music, but in skyscrapers, railroads, and
“all-modern conveniences.”	' j j
We wonder.1 . .	'.b '.
/ A GOOD INDICATION .
’ College men arid women, gathered in the national. capitol at the
.call of the Citizens’ Coinmittee of One Thousand, are-yesterday and to-
day attempting to work but a program for law observance, particularly
- as to prohibition, for the colleges and universities of the country.
.	' In calling the session,'at whichJ'50 colleges are to be represented,
the-committee said:, “In fecognitiori .of. the lfact that as a part of the
apparent.tendency^ev$ry where to- disregard Jawful and orderly methods
of life, this same spirit has-manifested itself to a. degree among the.
students of Jher institution . of higher, . education, The committee does
not believe these-violations are of such proportions that they are to be
regarded as an indictment.of the vast majority of those attending the
colleges ’ arid5 universities, but they represent a tendency which it is
believed ought to be promptly corrected.”	•
It is'hoped by the. committee that a real, thorough-going awaken-
ing :of the.natiori'.to.'the necessity ,of fundamental righteousness and
loyalty’ to orderly.methods of government will be fully considered and
■ discussed. ;	.
. This is . a good indication. It shows an earnest endeavor riot only
on the part of. the committee, but on the part of the colleges as well to
correct: a: growing evil. The most it can hope to do, however, is to
bring'to the attention- of individual college men and women the need
of a better/.respeet:for law and authority.' The true correction, must
conic from thd individual himself. -
If the conference now in session in Washington can bring home
to' individuals an old-fashioned respect for obedience to law and order,
•	it will have achieved its purpose,; Its success is-with every student at
Notre Darrie'arid with everyj student .in every college, in the land.

THE MARRIAGE VERDICT, by
Frank Spearman; Charles Scrib-
ner’s Sons,. New York.
■ Some years ago, Frank Spear-
man wrote what .is still his best
novel, “Robert Kimberly,” which
gave the Catholic doctrine on di-
vorce in a way- that compares fa-
vorably in many respects to Mrs.
Wilfred Ward’s “One Poor Scru-
ple.” Spearman’s latest novel,
“The Marriage Verdict” is very sim-
ilar in plot to his earlier work. The
heroine, unhappily married to a
man who has turned his attentions
in other directions, seeks releace
from the marriage bond, but be-
cause she is a Catholic, knows that
the church forbids it. The only
great difference between the two
novels is that in “Robert Kimber-
ly”., the heroine is released _ by.
death, while in “The Marriage Ver-]
diet” there is an arbitrary twisting
of the plot which makes it possible
to irivoke the Pauline' Privilege.
Spearman has nothing riew to
say; his book depends for its suc-
cess upon its plot. It is a plot
which is by no means unusual, and
one which could have been handled
by any one of a number of Catholic
authors who have not the reputa-
tion of Mr. Spearman. Perhaps the
outstanding fault is that he persists
in making the theology too appar-
ent, a fqult by no means unusual
in those who have a moral to drive
home.—J. S. B.

IRISH LOOK GOOD
IN PRACTICE GAME
squad is rounding into
. CONDITION AS SPRING
TRIP NEARS
A practice game featured yester-
day’s baseball practice for Coach
Keogan’s varsity nine. A semi-pro
team was scheduled to meet the
Irish, but failing to appeal’ at play-
ing time, the Notre Dame mentor
divided his squad and sent them
through eight innings of good, fast
ball playing.
With only a few days left before
the start of the Southern jaunt, the
battle for positions on the team has
dwindled down to two.or three men
for each position. The teams as
they were divided yesterday con-
sisted of Nolan, Ash, Sheehan and
Prendergrast on the‘infield;. Dunne,
Rese and Farrell held down the
garden positions, and McGrath and,
Silver were named as the batteries
of this team. Dauss and Smith
were on the twirling and receiving
end for the other team, for which
Kelly, Bergman and Vergara played
the outfield, and Sammon, Quinlan,
Scharer and Pearson made up the
infield.
Very little comment can be made
concerning the twirlers since Coach
Keogan is keeping the wares of his
slabmen in reserve. The varsity
will probably carry a personnel of
six pitchers, this year, which will
lighten the - mound duty for each
pitcher.
The coach has a choice of three
first basemen, of which Nolan looks
like the headline performer. Dunne
is dependable in the outfield as well
'as on the initial sack and looks good
at the plate. Sammon gave a cred-
itable showing in yesterday’s prac-
tice. Curly Ash and Quinlan were
the competitors on the keystone
corner yesterday, and both men
turned jn an easy game. Scharer
has been showing’some nice' form
at short stop while Pendergast,
Ed. Barry, and Pearson have been
performing around the third base
in acceptable fashion. The outfield
is still a problem and even the per-
sonnel of the spring trip may not
determine who will be on duty regu-
larly. There are four baseball let-
termen competing for the position
besides Tommy Farrell.
The practice session this after-
noon will be featured, by a game
with a Mishawaka team.

“THE HILL BILLY”
First Scrimmage
for Irish Gridmen
In the first football scrimmage of
the spring training season, held on
Cartier field yesterday afternoon,
six teams of moleskin candidates
were put through the gridiron mill
by Coach K. K. Rockne, and given
their first taste of the Irish Pigskin
sport which annually lays claim to
the attention of the sp oring world.
The squads were made up for the
most part of the freshmen team of
last fall. Sandwiched in between
the yearlings, who were introduced
to the sport light of Notre Dame by
working against the varsity last fall,
were many new men who are mak-
ing their first bid for a varsity
berth, and who incidentally made
a nice showing in yesterday’s scrim-
mage.
Both In the line and backfield
there appeared several men who
will undoubtedly make their.pres-
ence felt in the varsity ranks next
fall. Dick Hanousek and Joe Bo-
land, and several others showed up
well in the line and displayed their
effectiveness . on numerous occa-
sions. Among the candidates for
the end positions are two or three
outstanding performers whose work
yesterday afternoon was more than
acceptable and who should develop
rapidly under the Rockne systeih.
Backfield material, as usual, is
rather prominent and several of the
yearlings gave a very favorable ex-
hibition yesterday. O’Boyle and
Prelli enjoyed a very good season
last fall, and with a little more prac-
tice this spring they should be work-
ing in good form. Charles Reilly,
•Edwards and Mullins make up a
trio of freshmeri* quarterbacks who
have proven by their work that they
are headed for varsity company.
The squads ,were pitted against
each other and one side retained
the ball until they worked their way
down the length of the field. The
ball was then given to the other
side in the middle of the field, and
play ~was~~started” from scrimmage.-
The early part of the afternoon
was devoted to group work, where
several of last year’s team assisted
Coach Rockne.
IOWA BASEBALL
Coach Sam Barry of Iowa took
the Hawkeye' baseball squad out-
doors this week .for the first time
this year. The 40 candidates bun-
dled in sweaters, limited the prac-
tice session to hitting and-fielding.
Eight veterans from last year have
reported foi’ the squad, including
three pitchers. Chicago will open
the conference season April 12,
with a game at Iowa City. ;

ATTRACTS STARS

SLATED TO BE STRONG
IN RELAYS
DES MOINES, la., April 5.—The
Drake relay games scheduled for
April 25 and 26 will from all indi-
cations be one of the biggest track
classics in the west this year. The
importance of the event can not be
over estimated this year with the
approach of the Olympic trials in
^une. Every track star in the coun-
try entered in the Drake classic
will be out to break records and
assert his right to a place on the
American team going to France.
Such a motive will thus raise the
marks of the meet in proportion to
the competition.
Schools from the Missouri Valley
and Big Ten, and also universities
not attached to any athletic fed-
eration, such as Notre Dame, will
participate, and the stars of the re-
spective schools will have an oppor-
tunity seldom presented. Illinois,
holder of the world’s record in the
440-yard relay, and the American
intercollegiate record in- the 880-
yard relay, will probably not be
able to compete in the meet with
the same brilliancy that marked its
performance of last year if the in-
juries that are at present deplet-
ing the ranks of the Gillmen con-
tinue until the opening of the Drake
classic..
Iowa, Michigan, and. either Wis-
consin or Northwestern, will up-
hold the conference colors in. the
relay events. Nebraska, from the
Missouri conference, and Notre
Dame will make a strong bid for
relay honors.	' '
Illinois will be a favorite con-
tender in the field events. Harry
Gill has several noted weight-
men and a javelin thrower holding

Charley Judge to Lead
Yearling Track Team
Charley Judge of Sophomore
hall, star miler on the yearling
track team was elected by the fresh-
men numeral men to lead the 1927
outdoor track team, at a meeting
held in the Main building yester-
day noon.
Before the election Coach Rockne
issued the freshman numerals to 27
track men and nine basketball men.
The Frosh track team is one of the
best first year aggregations that has
beeri seen on the local cinders for
several years. The yearlings de-
feated Culver, and held Western
State Normal to a close count) and
are expected to perform in more
elegant fashion during the outdoor
season. Judge ;was one of the most
consistent performers on the squad,
and registered a mark in. the mile
run as good as 4:32. Frey was a
prominent contender in the high
jump, while Charley Reilly,' Mullin
and McDonald looked good in the
sprints. Barron and Wynrie in the
hurdles, and'Prelli in the quarter,

ord. Poor of Kansas and Wright
of Illinois "will be numbered among
the leading high jumpers, the Kan-
sas star clearing the bar recently at

Says College Stars
Fail in Big League
; “All that glitters is not gold,”
says a New York sport critic as he
looks with suspicion and doubt up-
on-each new recruit into,the ranks
.of major baseball, who has just been
raked into the big league by scouts
who tour the college baseball
camps each year.. From this adage,
he comes to-the conclusion that col-
• lege stars ■ sometimes fail in big
time baseball.	:
Very often it is the case that the
college star has skipped that in-
valuable training that accrues to
. the players in the minor leagues.
Nearly every college player has to
change, his playing form as. soon as
he:steps out in .major company. It
is very evident then that there is
some difference 'in- . the system
taught by college baseball coaches
and that taught in the camps of
professional baseball.
The eastern sport scribe men-
tidns Mohardt and Castner as
among those who enjoyed a bril-
liant career in college, but were
not ready for the majors when they
were . given their first -trial. It
might be added that Dick Falvey
probably made a better impression
than either of the other two men,
although Castner and Mohardt were
looked upon'favorably in the ma-
jprs. •	• s	.
. The men that have made good
and the men who have been re-
manded to the minors 'for season-
ing, would probably make two long
lists, but in both cases the setting
\ down- of <a few of the prominent
players wduld suffice. Glenn Kill-
inger, Penn State halfback; Urban,
Boston college football star, and
Hinky Haines, are the most noted
of the . recent flashes to appear in
the. majors ,and then fade out.
Killinger thought better of foot-
