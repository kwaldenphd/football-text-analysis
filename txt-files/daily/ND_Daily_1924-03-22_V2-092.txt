A Question
If one should ask what wound
inflicted, upon a humafi being
would give -the most lasting pain,
you would undoubtedly find some
difficulty in making a favorable re-
ply-	; i
Experience has taught us that a; ■
physical injury to the body would: ’
result in pain directly proportional! '
to the severity of the wound, but!
there is nothing that deals a great-1
er blow and inflicts a deeper and?
unhealing injury than an insult to;
our vanity. A' blow of. that kind;
is unparalleled to any physical ih-|
(jury, since it strikes the. heart di-,!
dectly.	' .	. ;/}
“Who are you?” is the ..question*
that we all,have often heard, .-some-j
times addressed to. us and some-!
times to others. To most of us it;
is nothing more than three ugly-
words which we hate to hear di-;
rected toward us. They strike us*
hard and make us feel smaller than;
we really are, so insignificantly;
small that we are often ashamed of!
ourselves.	J
Let us resolve that we will not:
be a “nobody.” As our age passes!
on, let us advance' with it and try>
; to accomplish something concrete;
, which will . eventually become .a?
stepping stone to the ladder of sue-;

The Cultivation of Taste
. Despite all that has been said
about censorship there will prob-
ably be poor books, poor drama,
and poor moving pictures as long
as there are people who are'will-
ing to .pay to read and see’ them,
The cultivation ' of good taste/
among the reading - and the play-
going public will do more-'to elim-*
inate foolish and ? objectionable
plays and books than any amount
of. legislation could do. -
. -.A university may play ah impor-
tant part in- the cultivation of this.
taste. It may give to its students .
such standards’ of judgment: that
they wilt be . able •’to discriminate
that which’ is - poor and.‘artificial
from that which is, excellent'and -.
genuine. A school which gives its
students an opportunity to ’become
acquainted with . literature and
drama of the worth while ■ type, is'
doing much to raise the’ literary
arid dramatic standards' of the
country.—N; Y. Daily News. ”

' t ‘‘I. rWpuld (have; to -expend, as much mental energy on my college
studies-as the average student if , I did not know how to manage my
memory; and. powers of concentration to the best , advantage. In mind

items. LiThis: result is mot attained merely by'.concentration but pri-
marily .iby -rearrangement, of i the new,.knowledge gained in. accordance

The point is that this blind student was probably. endowed with
no' keener intellect, no- better memory, no greater power of concentra-.
, tion; than the average -student; but the loss of sight has necessitated
for him a mental discipline1which [most people escape. Perhaps inch
’ a- discipline; is not advisable for all; but there are many students who,
jby; developing; arid using their powers of concentration in . class from
.day to day^ could’perfect-themselves from the tantalizing tricks played
by a rebellious memory after, the futile.cramming of examination time.

At .the Palace
This week’s show at the Palace
isn’t quite.what the doctor ordered.
An afternoon of otherwise good en-
tertainment is somewhat spoiled by
two stupid acts, which' lower the
general average of amusement.
Sophie Tucker,, came, sang, and
conquered. Like the proverbial
brook .of Tennyson, this versatile
comedienne is still running strong,
and judging from the applause
which. greeted her,' the end -is yet
nowhere .in.;sight. ' •
• Cook and Coan went up a rocket
and came down a stick. Their act
started off well but soon vibration
set; in . and. before it was over the
thing was-creaking in every joint.
Birdie Kramer seems like just a
nice .girl. with an aptitude for im-
■ itating. She does her imitations
very well, and prolonged applause
follows her act. z . .
. They call the last act “Alexand-!
The Department of Studies yes-

age of 95 per cent, or more, were

roll; William J. Coyne, Brownson,

If the proposed, plan goes through
there will be nd .more , soliciting on
the part of students, for the. sup-
port of the various , activities. A
plan is being’considered whereby a
student "will pay a fee in the begin-
ning of the collegiate year and the
fee would be apportioned between
the various organizations.. This
(Would also include his athletic tick-
et, subscription to the -newspaper
and the year book, membership in
the Student council, and: his .bit to
support organizations like the Glee
club, Y. ,M. C. A.,, etc. The tax
would amount to about $15 and
could be changed yearly by. a board
appointed for the purpose.

Watch Your Words
A prominent writer once said:
“If you want to know how a strang-

can tell who you are and what you
are, you have only to mind your
manners and watch your’ speech.
As' your speech is- so you are, for

Cobb’s efforts during his many
years in the national-pastime have
been crowned with success and he
has carved his niche in the hall’ of
athletic . fame. Cobb entered the
calcium glare in 1907 when.he lead
the American league batters with
an average of .350. He also gained
the record for stolen bases in that
year when he pilfered 49 bases. In
1915, Ty garnered-96 stolen bases.
“Young” Stribling and Mike Mc-
Tigue are training faithfully for
their fight at Newark on March 31,
when the light heavyweight title
will be at stake. The Macop school
boy hopes to annex the crown and
settle a score with the fighting
Irishman. '
At present neither is being giv-
en the odds.
Billy Gibson, manager of Benny
Leonard, says that he has practi-
cally closed a match in which his
protege will tackle Mickey Walker,
the welterweight champion. This
will be a big open shot for Benny,
for a. battle of this kind will tax
any of the balj parks in the big
cities. • There are no lightweights
worthy , to be classed as opponents
for Leonard s^ he steps sprightly
into the welterweight ranks and
starts in with the champion.

“Sunny” Jim Coffroth, former
California boxing promoter, is now
promoter of racing at Tia Juana.
Coffroth was given the name “Sun-
ny” because he never picked a day.
on which it rained to promote a
match.
This rather accounts for the pres-
ence of many old-time fighters there

Sullivan, and Fitzsimmons, is em-

lows: Yale, one-third ;• Princeton,
