Tbday I have a matter of editor-
ial policy which I wish to place be-
fore you for your solution. It con-
cerns a letter which came in yester-
day’s mail. The letter reads:
“My most Beloved Mr. Grundy:
“Here-is-a'.little news item for
your column which I so much enjoy
reading:	-	.
“The truth will out! We discov-
ered recently that John E. Uebbing,
^. professed woman-hater, detest-
■ er of feminine ways, exponent of
the theories of Emily Post, and a
great discusser of the fairer sex,
has been receiving beautifully
■ scented letters from one endearing
little miss attending Milwaukee
Normal who signs herself, ‘With
Love, just Vid.’ John contemplates
taking a trip to Milwaukee during
the Easter vacation—if not sooner.
“Now I thank you from the bot-
tom of my heart if you see that the
above article reaches its proper
place in the column. Love and ev-
; erything. ------—-r”
-0- -o-	:
The question, my assistants, is
whether ; or not a news item of this
nature deserves, place in the column
as the worthy gentleman (he ad-
mires me) suggests. Is its. tone
compatible with . your ideas of
Grundyesque reporting? Would
you publish'it?
-o- -o-	•
I have decided-—though I know
not your answers—that the item is
too personal;, therefore it shall not
run. 'I thank you for your consid-
eration of the matter.. '	. -
-o-’ -o- ; : - ■	. ; •
"-/A—real-^—Jiext
time: “The Mystery, of the Beard-
ed Man” will be solved for. my
readers. ’	1 \	•	•
-o- -o-
Iri view of so much incoming cor-
respondence! feel that now I may
. speak a few words to “Sis.” Of
course, it’s . all rather, confidential
' so all the readers will now turn
over1 to the, INKWELL, there to
play, with the. ink until I conclude
this •epistle. ...
'	-o- -o- .	-
Sweet Solace for the Neglected:
Yes, “Sis,” this effusion has been
long in coming . . . but tell me of
any big anticipated, event that. was
not so. - I blush to think that my
reply, is .limited to the conventional
black and white, of our printer, for,
after your glaring example, .1 fain
would paint my story in screaming
colors ’on the side of a skyscraper.
Such, you see, is the magnitude of
my interest.
I know you would enjoy Notre
Dame. It is so amusing . .. . I
mean the boys and their, tricks. Yes-
sir, I know much more about the
place than you read in my column.
? Some day, perhaps, the world will
know all. I have'in mind “The Se-
cret Memoirs of The Admirable Mr.
Grundy.” The sale will be terrific,
I imagine. '	.
: This epistolary romance is enter-
taining but not altogether complete.
Perhaps you had better put a re-
turn address on your next letter, in
■case it is lost. My cdnfidence, I
assure you, is inviolable. ,
When you . come down to N.. D.
‘ you must insist on meeting seniors
like Walter Noveski, Lionel Carney,
or Duke DePaolis, juniors like Mike
Neitzel, John Showel, or Hank
Wurzer . .;. others like Roland
■ Beery, or.Mansiel Haggerty. Do-
mg this you will have a composite
picture of what Notre Dame is and
what Notre Dame is not. Of course
you’ll bring along that Chicago
viewpoint ......
I simply .cannot be romantic to-
; day, or even rheumatic, for the
‘ “deadline” is calling and this letter
must end. Be good to me again—
. soon. .	-
Ever eager, bashful, “means
well,” . MR. GRUNDY.
Spectre of Only Defeat on 1923 Grid Card
Still Haunts N. D., Says Daily Nebraskan
Banners bearing the slogan “Beat
Nebraska” are being displayed on
the Notre Dame campus; pep meet-
ings are held nightly and Rockne is
making energetic plans for the 1924
Husker game. Such is the impres-
sion one would gain from the read-
ing of an article appearing in the
Daily Nebraskan of Thursday last.
According to this story the spectre
of that last defeat still haunts the
University; To quote one signifi-
cant paragraph:
“ ‘Nebraska is the big game for
1924; let’s win if we have to lose
all others,’ says Rockne.”
But when interviewed yesterday
in the gym Rockne expressed him-
self in different terms.
Fr. Nieuwland
Speaks at Purdue
Rev. J. A. Nieuwland, of the
Chemistry Department of the Uni-
versity spoke before the Purdue
section of the American Chemical
Society at Purdue University Feb-
ruary 21. He discussed-a field of
research in which he himself is act-
ively engaged, his subject being
“Acetylene in Organic Syntheses.”
Father Nieuwland reports that
the section bf the A. C. S. is very
active at Purdue.
FROSHTRACK MEN
WIN CULVER MEET
Freshman and Sophomore Leading
League; Schedule for Remain- ;
der of Season Announced. .
The-F-reshman-track—team?_:..of
Notre. Dame won its . first inter-
scholastic meet of the season when
it defeated the Culver Miliary
Academy in an indoor dual meet at
Culver Saturday afternoon. This
was the first time in several years
that a freshman team from Notre
Dame has been able to register a
victory, over the cadets in an indoor
meet. The victory speaks well for
the freshmen cinder, men as Culver
is considered one of the fastest track
teams in the country in its class. ,
Out of nine events Notre Dame
took seven firsts, three seconds, and
two thirds. Barron of Notre Dame
was high man of the meet with a
total of eight points. He. was a
member of the relay team which
took first. Judge, of Notre Dame,
broke- the record for the mile at
Culver, when he covered the "dis-
tance in 4:53.
Events in which Notre Dame
placed:
35-Yard Dash: Mullen, first;
Riley, second; McCay, third. Time,
3 4-5. '
220-Yard Dash: Wilhelm and
Riley tied for second.
35-Yard Low Hurdles: Barron,
first.
35-Yard High Hurdles: Barron,
second.
Shot Put: Boland, first; Mc-
Manus, third. Distance, 42 feet.
High Jump: Frye, first. Height,
5 feet 11 inches. •
Half : Mile: Masterson, first.
Time, 2:18. •	\	'
Mile: Judge, first. ■ Time, 4:53.
Notre Dame Relay: Prelli, Mc-
Donald, Barron and Mullen, first.
Time, 1:30.
~ TO TOSS DISCUS
.Tom Lieb will toss the discus in
the national indoor track and field
meet, which will.be held in New
York- on March 5 under the. aus-
pices of the A. A; U. Practically
all of the country’s track and field
champions have been entered.
Illinois A. C., New .York A. C.,
Boston A? C., Newark A. ,C., and
Chicago A. C. have formally en-
tered the meet and the battle for
team honors is expected to be waged
among them. However, some of
the university teams entered may
upset the dope.
. “We will take Nebraska on in
our regular stride and for the first
time in thre years. we will meet
them on a turf field. Just forget it
until next year.”
And so we will let the matter
rest. And in closing it will not be
amiss to suggest that both univer-
sities adopt as their present motto
“Let’s forget it until next year.”
Basketball, baseball and track
will aid Nebraska in passing the
many months that separate the
present and that much discussed
game in “24.”. May the time pass
pleasantly for the Nebraskans and
may their defeat by Notre Dame
next November be the only set-back
in an otherwise successful season.

NOTRE DAME BEATS
ST. VIATORS, 34-19
Kizer, Dienhart and Enright Star
in Last Home Game
of Season.
Captain Gene Mayl and his quin-
tet of Fighting Irish marked their
last appearance of the season on
the home floor, by scoring a victory
over the scrappy St. Viator’s five,
34-19, on the “Y” court, last night.
The last home game was charac-
terized by more action than has
been witnessed on the “Y” floor
since the night of the Michigan tri-
umph. The band of court perform-
ers from Chicago, under the leader-
ship of Captain Donnelly, fought a .
bitter, uphill fight all the way, arid
would have in no small way aug-
mented their score if their spectac-
ular long shots had come any near-
er to the basket.	,
The Irish quintet enjoyed no lit-
tle success last night in sinking the
leather, but was continually hard- .
pressed by the scrappy floor game
put up by the “Windy City” vis-
itors. Kizer, Dienhart, and En-
right were the leading scorers for
the local quintet. All of Kizer’s
four field goals were beautiful
tosses from difficult angles near the
middle of the floor.
Floor Game Speedy
' Dienhart, who went in for Ma-
honey at forward, displayed some -
smart basketball work and prom-
ises to be a valuable addition to the
team for next year’s campaign.
Mahoney struck an off night on bas-
ket shooting but played a fighting
defense all the time he was in the
game. .
. The scoring was slow and the
playing time;was consumed mostly.
in a floor game that was riot with .
action during both Periods.
Kizer opened the scoring with a
clever shot from the side of the
floor and shortly after, Mayl drib-
bled through the visitors’ defense
and scored the second basket.
Winterhalter fouled Enright, and
the ■ Irish center scored one in two
tries.. . Donnelly was fouled arid
scored. one basket in two tries, and
J. Winterhalter registered the. first
goal for the Chicago, team.. En-
right stepped into the scoring; col- -
umn again with three field goals in
succession and Mayl fouled ■ Lyons,
who scored on both tries. Lyons
played a hard, fast game for the .
visitors all evening.
Dienhart Scores by Free Throws
Mayl fouled Lyons again, but he ;
failed: to count, and Kizer regis-
tered: another .field goal. Dienhart
was fouled and scored on Loth tries.
Reardon fouled McGrath, who
scored one in a single trial. Rear-
don scored on McGrath’s foul. Bar-
rett scored a field goal, and the
half ended. The score stood 16 to
8 in favor of Notre Dame.
Kizer: fouled Lyons at the open-
ing of the second frame and the;St. .
Viator forward counted one in: two -
tries. ■ Dienhart registered a field
goal, and was followed by Kizer,
who dropped his third long shot.
Ward was fouled and scored one of
two tries, and Reardon counted
with a field goal.
Kizer Scores Again ,
Donelly, who scored St. Viator’s
first field goal in the second half,
was fouled: shortly afterwards by
Dienhart rang up another, field
Winterhalter broke into the scoring
column with a field goal arid Dien-
hardt retaliated with a field goal
for Notre Dame. Reardon fouled
Lyons and he scored one counter.
Dienhardt rang up another/ field
goal, and Kizer followed him with
another two points. Reardon,
boosted the Irish score with a field
goal and Miller scored one on two
tries after being fouled by Dal-
rymple. ., Crowe registered his first
field goal of the game, and Dal-
rymple followed with two points for

Dance Permits for
Frolic Extended
Dance permits for the Freshman
Frolic, to be held at the Palais
Royale Friday night, will be ex-
tended to 2 o’clock Saturday morn-
ing to every student possessing a
ticket. At a committee meeting
last week it was decided not to give
corsages, and other final arrange-
ments were made.
Joseph Murray, secretary of the
class, announced that practically
the same arrangements have been
made for the St. “Mary’s girls that
were made at the Sophomore Cotil-
lion. The girls will be conveyed to
the LaSalle' hotel, where their es-
corts will, meet them at 8:45.
Due to the limited number of
tickets, students who'have not as
yet purchased tickets are requested
to do so at once as the last minute
rush has. been heavy. A large
number of tickets have been sold to
upper classmen, who are taking an
unusual interest in the Frolic this
year.

Under the Reading Lamp
The Better Way
You Pharisees who are put to no
orthographical- pains in writing our
tortuous mother tongue, who are
never confused by the sequence of
“i” and “e” in “believe,” and who-
know by instinct that sergeant has
two “e’s” and not two “a’s”—
these paragraphs of solace are not
addressed to you. They are di-
rected to that honorable band of
bad spellers whose tribulations be-
gan in the red schoolhouse, and
whose ears have smarted these
many years under your smug and
raucous guffaws.
o--o
“Sense and knowledge come , by
study and experience, but the pow-
er to spell, correctly is the gift of
God.” Let those who have it be
reverent. But for us who have not
—turn aside your faces while we
rummage for consolation among the
annals of .our fathers.
0—o	...
We are truthful if not literate,
and before we are done, we shall
probably feel in duty bound to tell
you that the great Shakespeare
himself was somewhat whimsical in |
his spelling—rendering his own
patronymic. three or four different
ways, and spelling honor once with
the “u” in the same dedicatory par-
agraph on the fly-leaf of “Venus
and Adonis.”
0—o
Were it not in bad taste, we
mights even be-tempted to. cite you
the verbal aberrations of the Fa-
ther of Your Country, : who dis-
patched from Mt. Vernon, an order
for a “rheam of paper,” a beaver
“hatt,” a suit of “cloaths” and ;a
pair of “sattin” shoes. •	•
o—o :
We might even slyly;confide that
Marlborough, Lord Nelson, the
Duke of Wellington, Romney, Turn-
er,. Benjamin West, President of
the .Royal Academy, and Andrew
Jackson, President .of the United
States, were, to say the least, ec-
centric in.\ their word forms;. and
that Napoleon (a lamentable spell-
er); mnee -said~to~ Las Casesp“You
do not write orthographically, do
you? At least, I suppose you do
not; dor a man occupied; with pub-
lic or other important business (the
emphasis would be ours)-—a min-
ister, for instance—cannot or need
not attend to orthography. His
ideas must flow faster than his hand
can trace them; he has only time
to place his points; he must put
words in letters, and phrases in
words, and let the scribes make, it
out afterwards.”
b—o
But you would probably retaliate
—you of the elect—rthat “these are
warriors-and daubers, men of paint
and , action. : Get to your literary
men and scholars, to whom the
form and tradition of words are a
matter of honor.”	- .
. •.	o—o ;
And then we should have to tell
you about Robert. Louis Stevenson,
whose dictionary, was his Bible, yet
•who - confessed himself, vanquished
by the word “hemorrhage”—one he
had reason to know too well. And
about Keats, whose ■ eye was. so
quick for verbal architecture, yet
who went down under the mysteries
of “fricassee.” And about Byron,
to whom spelling,- says his biogra-
pher Moore, “was a very late: ac-
complishment.” And about erudite
William Morris, who never learned
to spell'at all, and’whose “Life and
Death of Jason” had to be reprint-
ed because he misspelled a word so
common that his reader thought it
intentional. Aye, and’ about the
much more learned Goethe—Ger-
many’s supreme literary ; genius—
who was never quite able to trust
himself away from his Worterbuch.
And about our own Joaquin Miller,,
who, enraged by criticism, fero-
ciously thundered that it was no
business of a poet to spell; the
I proof-reader was paid to do it. .
BUT ONE REMEDY
. Winter months' are always dull seasons for business, speaking gen-
' erally. But when spring makes its debut business seems to revive grad-
ually until early in the fall when the maximum productions are reached.
Such .have been the indications of: the reliable barometers almost every-
where; And it;has also-become very noticeable that the proportion of
married women-employed-in industries during these busy months is
rapidly increasing.
■ Relying on this information- one may take it for granted that
within the next few weeks the industrial dynamos in all parts of the
.country will be operating at full capacity to generate the necessary
power to drive the huge, complex machines. And many persons will
be employed to manipulate them, or to assemble the pieces manufac-
tured by them. But the matter :of greatest importance' is this: what
will be the proportion of married, women so employed?
This problem has become one of much significance because, in the
past, either through, pure selfishness, total ignorance, or lack of organ-
• ization, married women in industries have spoiled’, the. labor market for
men, neglected their maternal and domestic duties, and-greatly in-
creased the percentage of divorces. And unless .measures are taken
immediately to prevent their numbers from greatly,; increasing, the
conditions will become much worse than they have been.
Before any cure is effected, however, one must take the customary
dose of prevention; and in this case, like in.all others of serious nature,
the antidote must be preceded by a thorough diagnosis to determine the
causes of the economic disease.
Probably the most prevalent cause is that the husband does not
. receive Ssufiicient wages to support his family, and the wife1 feels com-
pelled to assist him by seeking some form of employment. Unfortun-
ately, for such a family in which both, husband-and. wife work, sta-
- tistics show that their total -wage bill is, on the average,, only equal to
that of the family in which the wife does not go to work.
Then the other momentous causes for women becoming engaged
• in-.industrial activities are: the unemployment, of husbands, often
^brought:about by greedy women promising to work the same job for
less; money than men; the lack of organziation. among .certain groups,
of,men; the. disability of husbands, either temporary or permanent;
the sheer desire some women have to work simply because they enjoy
it; the hope women hold of being; able to raise their standard of living
tbrthat level to which they were accustomed before marriage; and the
* theory, cherished by, “advanced femininists,” as they call themselves,
. that a woman should strive.to support herself and not be a parasite,
> because marriage is only an; incident in a woman’s life and should hot
. interfere with her efforts’to be independent.
Some contend that all of these causes are merely the outgrowth of
' .the first^namely, the underpayment, of men. Certainly the greater
relative importance of this cause-' cannot be doubted; and if the other,
causes are actually the results of: it, then, the logical thing to do is to-
endeavor to remove.that primary, cause. And this can be accomplished;
only by educating both the employer and the employe,/and proving to’
them that although their interests are identically. different they are
. diversely the.same. -	. ~ ’	;
PREPAREDNESS
. : : There are-two types of preparedness. The first of these is .the
“easy” preparedness, the second may ,be called thorough preparedness.
A very adequate and important example showing these classifications is
the Oregon school bill. /Every sensible-minded and unprejudiced indi-
vidual is prepared to give a sensible. opinion7 on this bill, and that
opinion will invariably condemn it. But that is not enough. ’ It is the
easy way and it is really no preparedness at all.- It is not enough to.
•say that a thing is wrong and:then suppose that the matter is closed.
'It is exactly this type of laxity that gives the enemy unhampered
ground to further its designs? To’be really prepared is to look into
every aspect of a-proposition and to be ready to. meet every emergency
that may arise. •	• ’	.	. :
Here, at Notre Daine ,there is a large amount of; ignorance con-
cerning the Oregon.school bill. Everyone knows that ft is .wrong but
very few know every reason for its being wrong, and still Tewer pause
to think of the results that will surely come if. the bill is legally passed.
This easy attitude should have no place at Notre Dame. Rathet there

Histories of Scribblers and Toledo Club,
Winners ofDaily’s Contest, Outlie
THE
SCRIBBLERS
Organized November 8, 1922,
from a small group of men known
as the Writers’ Club, which
had
met spasmodically during the two
preceding years.
From this small nucleus the new;
J organization, The Scribblers,. was
formed.-
Membership is limited to twenty
men, exclusive of active graduate |
members, selected primarily for
their literary accomplishment at
Notre Dame.
Meetings are held regularly ev-.
ery two weeks. At. these meetings
some prominent literary man ad-:
dresses the club, papers are read
and criticized, and various ques-
tions are thrown open to discus-
sion.
Purpose of the club: To stimu-
late both members and. non-mem-
bers to greater and better literary
endeavor.	. •
June, 1923—The Scribblers’ Poet-
ry Contest was announced; first
prize, $20; second prize, $10;
September, 1923—The ; . Scrib-
blers is made responsible for the
editorship of “The Scholastic.”
December, 1923—“The Scrib-
blers’ Book of Notre Dame Verse,”
an anthology of the best Notre
Dame verse published between 1917
and November, 1923, and: featur-
ing the winning poems of The
Scribblers’ Poetry Contest, was pub-
lished.
What Others Say
A Blot on the Escutcheon of Honor’
For many years business enter-
prise was conducted on a competi-
tive system of laissez-faire. That is
to say that they were let alone to
work together on a basis of individ-
ual honor. But until trade practice
and unjust discrimination; made
governmental regulation necessary
and expedient. Experience proved
that rivalry resolved into war of :a
commercial nature..	.
Examinations may be thought of
as1 an analogy . of business competi-
tion. The students are entered in_
a meet, striving for grades-of schol-
arship. The arguments for the
Honor System are comparable to
the theory of letting business work
out its own course, according to
honor within the trade. Experi-
ence likewise proved, that the Honor
System was unwise because it af-
forded temptations for. certain stu-
dents to place unjust handicaps up-
on their classmates by bribing and
cheating. during examinations. >
Competition for points in grades
has had to come under faculty su-
pervision in .order to insure more
nearly perfect conduct, in the sport
of grades. The police force in ex-
aminations is not there to wield the
“billy” but to assure every student
of fair, and equal chances to display
his merits. But in spite of all pow-
ers that be, there is always, some

THE TOLEDO CLUB i
. Organized in September, 1921
when twelve men from Toledo com’
bined to form a club in which, the ‘
men from that city might feel at
liberty to discuss social affairs, to
be. given either at Notre Dame or in
Toledo.
-Members assemble every other
Sunday morning to discuss matters
which relate to the club.
Since the beginning of the school
year, the. Toledo Club has promoted
the following entertainments:
September,. 1923. . Hard Times.
Dance.
Christmas, 1923.
Christmas, 1923. Two dances:
one formal and the other informal'
At Easter time another dance is
to be given by the club, and the or-
ganization has planned to , give a
final dance in June.
. In addition to providing the fore-!
going entertainments, the . Toledo
Club gave the new mascot, Tippe-
rary Terrence, to the University.
On the Carnegie Tech student trip',
the. club arranged a breakfast for
the .Notre Dame band and the 300
students who took the trip.
The organizations is ; now plan-
ning to bring, the. Glee Club to To-
ledo during the Easter holidays for
two concerts. The proceeds from
these concerts, in addition to the
amount realized from a dance, will
be contributed to the. new-Cathed-

At The Blackstone
This present-day piper did it with
chocolate sodas and sea stories in-
stead of enchanted pipes, but his
numerous following was none the
less enthralled. .
They Have a deeper insight into
his character than the righteous
town committee, which falsely
brands him as a pie-eyed piper, and
requests that he and. the village sep-'
arate indefinitely. When he packs
.his other shirt and hits the trail,
the younger generation falls into
line and follows him to the water’s
edge, where," not being as vindic-
tive as the original piper, he sends
them back, instead of disappearing
with them forever. .
This is without doubt the most
/ wholesome picture of the month.
You can recommend it unhesitat-
ingly. to everyone from first to sec-
ond childhood, inclusive. There is
a delightful lack of heavy love
scenes, battles royal, and intricate
villainy.
The plot is simplicity itself.
. There is just enough of the original
Hamlin in it to justify the title, but
Booth Tarkington fills his magic
pen with the old legend, and gives
us his very clever modernized ver-
sion of the thing.
Thomas Meighan, Lois Wilson,
and George Fawcett are to be prais-
ed for,their excellent work, which
was greatly responsible for the suc-
cess of the picture. •
The first , two acts of the vaude-
ville provide an opportunity to take
a smoke without missing anything
important. The third, “Vanity Re-
. vue,” is fair. The harp solo is good,
and the two girls who strain their
'memories to remember “when they
were kids” aren’t so . bad. The
~" priiha-donna, however, missed her
vocation. She should be. doing al-
most anything else.—P. C. M.
At The Palace . *
Little Jack Horner had - nothing
on us yesterday at the-Palace.' We
were sittin’ in the corner the whole
afternoon, but our occasional
. glimpses of the stage allow us to
. vouch for one interesting bit of in-
formation, viz: the show this week,
is certainly no better, than fair.
The best act of the day was prob-
ably “Jack Allyn’s Aces and Alice
Tyrell.” Strange as it may seem.
Jack holds nine aces, which cer-
tainly isn’t according to Hoyle.
Alice Tyrell kicks, splits, and turns
. handsprings in a manner that ought
to please the most exacting, and
Allyn’s merry men supply the har-
monies.	.

act is a succession of dull stretches,
punctuated by occasional moments
of hilarity. Is it worth your while
to sit through the stretches to wait
for the moments? As some one has
said, that is the question.
First on the program is a con-
tortionist . act which is all wool and
a yard wide. The fellow does ev-
erything but tie himself into a four-

applause.
“The Uninvited Guest” is the
screen attraction, and it is very sat-

the scenes are real works of artistic
genius, and the plot is different
from the ordinary run of moving
picture complications. Mary Mc-
Laren and Jean Tolley are the

Illinois, following the lead
Notre Dame, has issued a book
of
of
student verse. We sincerely hope
that the new crop of college poets
is far better than the harvest of
“Verse-writers”, turned out by the
university in the last decade, to
wit: Carl Sandburg, Edgar Lee
Masters, and Vachel Lindsey. Lew'
Sarrett is to us the only exception
in the Illinois claim to poetic, fame.
The works of this young writer are
really worthy of the title, of poetry.

Today the interhall relays will
continue their advance toward ter-
mination when the seventh series
will be run off. Due to the post-
ponement of last Thursday’s races,
the schedule has been forced back
one day. The teams which were
-scheduled to meet then, will meet
today.
• Leading the league are the.
Freshman and Sophomore sextets,
which have yet to taste defeat.
Carroll Hall is close behind with
' one loss, with Corby, Brownson,
and the others trailing.
Freshman Hall is said to have
made the fast time of 1:36 1-5 two
weeks before, but this' mark was
not accepted as official. Sophomore-
holds the official record - for this
year with a mark;: of 1:36 3-5.
Rockne says he thinks that this
time will be bettered, however.
Keen interest is being aroused by
the races, and as all the teams are
now in their best form, the gym
