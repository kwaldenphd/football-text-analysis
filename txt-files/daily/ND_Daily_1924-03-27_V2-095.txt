PRESIDENT SWIFT
OUTLINES S.A.C.
CONSTITUTION
IMPORTANT CHANGES MADE
CHANCE FOR STUDENTS TO
. BE FAMILIARZED WITH IT
The revised constitution of the
Students’ Activities Council, print-,
ed as a supplement to this issue of
the DAILY, was made public yes-
terday by James P. Swift, president
of the council.
Outlines Changes
President Swift explains the
changes in the constitution in the
following statement:
“With this issue of the bAILY
the S. A. C. presents its slightly re-
vised constitution to the under-,
graduate bojly for that organiza-
tion’s approval. At the time the
S. A. C. was originated a constitu-
tion was drawn lip and approved by
the administrative officials of the
university’ and the student body.
Since that time the general princi-
ples of that charter have been fol-
lowed though . the , document has
never been kept up to date.
“For some time a need has been
felt for an up-to-date constitution
and for a general understanding of
the power and duties ofthe S. A. C.
in order that every, member of the
university may have a knowledge of
the workings of the student govern-
ing body and a thorough., under-
standing of just what may be ex-
pected of the council.	t
New Name Chosen
“The only changes in the revised
constitution are those pertaining to
.scholastic _sta.udijog.__of_members,
rules pertaining to discipline and
government of the council and, a
change in name. For purposes of
administration ’it. was thought ex-
pedient to change the name from
the Students’ Activities Committee
to the Students’ Activities Council
and the name of the chief executive
from chairman- to president. The
advisibility of this lies in .that here-
tofore there has been-a tendency to
confuse statements of sub-commit-
tees with statements of the, commit-
tee as. a wliole and likewise there
has been a confusion as to chair-
men of the sub-committees and the
chairman , of. the committee as a
whole. .

ROCKNE SIGNS FOR
TERM OF 10YEARS
WITH NOTRE DAME
COACH MAKES STATEMENT;
WILL CELEBRATE ROCKNE
DAY, APRIL 24.
The persistent rumors that have
been circulating about the country
for the past two weeks, intimating
that Knute K. Rockne’s regime as
athletic director-at the University
of Notre Dame would terminate in
1925 were suddenly 'dispelled by the
announcement of Rev. Mathew
Walsh, president of the university,
that .the illustrious Irish, coach and
nationally honored football stateg-
ist has signed a ten-year contract to
remain as athletic director at Notre
Dame.	. ,
The announcement was received
on the. campus with hearty approba-
tion and the feeling of uneasiness
among the students that originated
from - the widespread rumors and
which would have suddenly become
a huge.disappointment had Rockne:
extended his services to another in-
stitution, was instantly ■ changed to
one of cheerful anticipation of the
future.
S. A. C. Presents Resolution
The S. A. G. in taking a very act-
ive part in the athletic situation
presented a resolution to Rev. Mat-
thew Walsh, president of the uni- •
versity, before the announcement .
of the ten-year contract was -made,
expressing the regard of the Notre
Dame students for Rockne and
pledging the support of the S/A. C.
in any effort that. would be put
forward to retain the services of
Coach Rockne. ...	. . . .
~''~Because MHe'’*’shorthess' ofMime’ ~
would, not permit of a. widespread
announcement of the mass meeting
scheduled, for the gym at-4:30 yes-
pledging the support of the S. A.t C. '
was postponed .and it was decided
to observe April 24 as Rockne Day.
The occasion will be featured: by a .
mass meeting in the gym at 6:30.
. Rockne’s Statement
■ “During the past year or two, .
there has been a number of state-
ments appearing in the public \
press to the effect that ,1 had in
mind severing my connections with
the University of Notre Dame, arid
taking up coaching work in some
other school. These reports have
been the cause of unusual annoy-
ance, both to me and the univer-
sity which I am privileged; to-
serve. In the';past few . weeks;
this rumor has been-renewed, .and ’,
statements which might be inter- -
preted as coming from me have,
led interested people; to believe.
that I have in mind going to an-
other school .next fall. - I feel that.
I owe it to the University of Notre
Dame to ” state, once and for all,
that I have no iritentions whatever
of giving up my present associations
with Notre Dame, as long as the
university sees fit to retairi me.’ '
Tribute to Players
. ’ “I have just gone .'over the whole
situation with the president of the
university, and. in the hopes of
forestalling any future annoying
references,' either to. me or the -
university, I wish to go on record
as saying, that if any school in the.
country feels the need of a coach
any time within the next ten’ years,
they will .. have , to leave Notre ;
Danie and. myselfout of consider-:
ation. Notre Dame, is -a part , of
my life, and my one ambition is
to spend .that’ life ?at . the / school /
that has made me whatevei' I am. :
I wish, particularly, to correct.any..
impression • that may have gone
abroad to the effect that the /rela-
tions between myself ;arid ■ Notre
Dame : have: riot . always been . of: a ;
most, kindly nature. Notre•,Dame
is my,.school. ; My only interest in
any other . institutions is- to' give-
them an opportunity, as occasion
offers, to test the athletic ability of
the finest type’' of college athletes
in America.” . -	-	- ■	■ ■

How Should Dr. Levermore Spend
His Money?
Suppose $50,000 dropped down
on you one day?	'
Dr. Charles H. Levermore of New
York won the Bok peace prize and

was in comfortable circumstances
and would have remained so had he
never heard of Edward W. Bok.
Dr. Levermore accepted the prob-

A NOTRE DAME MAN
Knute Rockne has pledged his loyalty to his school.
In a statement made Tuesday Notre Dame’s great football mentor
set at rest widespread fears that he would leave the quadrangle at the
expiration of his present contract. That statement and the act which
preceded it, the signing of a ten year contract, will ’
through the years of the University’s history.
Rockne, at the peak of fame and with a score
from colleges much larger than our own, declared
as long as Notre Dame needed his, services Notre
first' call on them. His act explains his success. _
works under Rockne will ever forget that the mentor has set the great i
example of faith to Notre Dame.	j
Rockne has written a Notre Dame loyalty code, in the statement
he made. It is a simple one: “Notre. Dame'is a part of my life, and
my one ambitioD-is to-spend. that life ?at .the. school that has made me
whatever I. am. ..... Notre Dame is my school. My only interest
in other institutions is to give them an opportunity, as occasion offers,
to test the athletic ability of the finest type of college athletes in

and didn’t worry about it. Hun-
dreds of other people did.
A small army of promoters of
one kind and another have been be-
seiging Dr. Levermore and trying
by every conceivable means to sep-
arate him from his money.
Such is the way of the world.
Dr. Levermore was in comfortable
circumstances when this money
mine to him, and yet with the mon-
ey came people by the scores to try
to relieve him of it.
“How would you spend the $50,-
000 if you were just.going to spend
it?” the doctor* was asked.
“Take a trip around the world,”
Former Students
Visit on Campus
Two prominent alumni of Notre
Dame, William Draper, ’05, and
Fred Steers, ’ll, were visitors on
the campus yesterday. Both men
were ' actively engaged in athletics
when they were undergraduates, be-
ing captains of teams.
' Mr. Draper was captain of the
track team for three consecutive
years, 1902-4-5, and played on the
football team in 1904 and 1905.'
When he graduated he remained
here for two years, and during that
time was manager of all sports and
coach of the track team.
Fred Steers was also a mono-
Dr. Browne Honored
by Letter from Rome
Dr. J. Lewis Browne, director of
the Glee club has been honored by
the following letter from Cardinal
Gasparri, secretary to His Holiness
Pope Pius XI:
“I am fulfilling the pleasant
charge of manifesting to you that-
the Holy Father has been greatly
pleased to ,accept the homage with
which you, with delicate thought,
have wished to honor him in dedi-
cating to him youi’ sacred musical
compositions.
“His Holiness thanks you for this.

And so the doctor’s idea on how
to spend the $50,000 differed from

ing. It will be the first one that he
has given here.
ON GROWING OLD	,	|
To think of age in youth is only to ponder on a vague and imma-;
terial tomorrow. For the young man there are the dim horrors of (
superannuation, to the superannuated there are memories. Age will <
always be the remembrancer - and youth will persistently put aside
coldly the apparition until the hair is thin and gray.
Some fortunate individuals seem to have found perpetual youth,
they never pass thirty-five; they die at sixty only thirty-five. As it
were, they linger at that turnstile of existence until Death smiles and
swishes them away as they were'just turning old.	'
; > Perhaps these are best. It is regrettable that man can not usually
.do the big things of life before thirty-five; that he can not enjoy
•success; that he can not flounder in his delirium of service. . Would it
not be so much more appropriate that one taste the sweetness of reward
when best able to appreciate it?
. Some do, but it is not the ordinary method of life. They seem
< to say with Chesterton:	-	.
‘Men grow too old for love, my love,
Meh grow too old for wine,
But I shall not grow too old to see	. 1
•Unearthly daylight shine,	'
Changing my chamber’s dust to snow '
Till I doubt if it be mine.”
, It is our job to remain young, to keep our youth as a trust from
God, to avoid the shadow of the grave until it'yawns before us. We
owe our service to the world which; .has given us opportunity-and to
' , God who has given us body and soul. Squander youth and squander
\ the funds God has .deposited in the bank of life!	'

Prof. Sullivan, of the department
of■ public speaking, yesterday stat-
ed that he was not authority for
the story regarding the school of
expression contemplated next year
which was printed in a recent issue
, of the DAILY. His statement
was made to correct an impression
|that he made the story public.-
TO THE CHURCH IN AMERICA
“Wherefore we decided to elevate to the sacred purple two digni-
taries of the church in the United States, who, by their personal quali-
ties, the importance of their respective sees, and the zeal and merit of
their pastorial ministry, already had shed the luster of the hierarchy
on the United States. If the act is extraordinary, the moment which
inspires .it also is extraordinary and unexampled.”	- .
' V These were the words of Pope Pius in his allocution on the recent
occasion of'the elevation of Patrick J. Hayes, of New York, and George
W. Mundelein to the college, of cardinals in Rome'. To every American
Catholic :they should not only be words of tribute, but of encourage-
ment for the, church militant in the United States.
•- - “Men’s clothes will stay up,” says a current news story. We sup-
' pose that means'the price,, so don’t throw your belts away. .	’

Illinois Track Team
Strong in Field Events
Coach Harry Gill’s nationally
known Illinois track team has given
up its winter quarters in favor of
the outdoor track. The distance
men are working out on the cinders
and the weightmen are limbering
up on the field. ‘
From all indications, the Gillmen
will be well fortified with a coterie
of stars in the field events. With
Angiers holding the American col-
legiate record in the javelin and
several of his team-mates within a
few strides of a title, the Fighting
Illini will give the championship
team of Walter Christie at Califor-
nia a nip and tuck fight for honors.
The Suckers should also be a prom-
inent figure in the outdoor western
conference meet. Angier’s record
stands at 203 feet 3 inches.
The Illinois mentor has another
high jump star who is almost a sec-
ond edition of Harold Osborne.
Wright looks good for a first place
in-the-co nfer ence,having- already-
registered a.height of 6 ft. 3 1-4 in.

GET WORKOUT
Headgears, water pails and play-
ers with injuries have once *more
taken their place in the life at the
university. With the continuation
of acceptable weather, Coach Rock-
ne and his squad of football aspir-
ants are slowly rounding into grid-
iron form, and with no interrup-
tion in the practice schedule, scrim-
mage work will probably be intro-
duced "within the next ten days.
The squad was divided into the
various positions last night, and
several of last year’s veterans, in-
cluding Rip Miller, Oberst, and
“Red” Maher, assisted Rockne in
drilling the new candidates,
linemen were sent through

Coach George Keogan’s’ baseball
squad is keeping pace with Rockne’s
track and football teams and is
looking forward to outdoor practice.
The program for yesterday in-
cluded batting practice and infield
practice as well as the usual bat-
tery practice.

Coach Walter Christie of the
University of California is recruit-

350 men reported for track practice

is keeping close, watch on the men
running on the interhall teams.

An Extraordinary Picture!
It is quite evident that fighters
are receiving sums beyond all value
of services rendered. Enormous
gate receipts are working greater
damage to the game than anything
else now on the surface. Yet a
fighter is entitled to a fair precent-
age of what is attracted to the box
office and promoters are also enti-
tled to a fair percentage. It is not
fair that the fighter who makes the
large receipts possible, be-given only
one-fourth the amount the promoter
receives.
It is । suggested that a law be
passed cutting the prices of admis-
sion, making the highest price some-
where between $4 and $9. This
would reduce the tremendous re-
ceipts and also rich purses which
have been falling into the hands of
champions. The . adoption of such
a plan will work to the benefit of
the fight fan. It is undoubtedly
true that the sums paid to fighters
are all. out of proportion to what
they give in return.'
Jimmy O’Connell is probably the
greatest natural hitter in baseball,
according to Sam Crawford, who
led the National league in extra-
base hits for many years. Some of
his critics contend that he can’t
hit a flock of rain drops with an
umbrella, but this year Jimmy will
hit, say McGraw and Hughey Jen-
nings.
Perhaps the cleverest, fighter that
has ever been inside the resined
arena was “New Orleans” Joe Man-
dot. This little 133-pound French-
man directed an avalanche of
It sums up like this:

This ring tactician had every in-
gredient that goes to make up a
champion except one-—he lacked a
sleep-producing punch. Mandot
succeeded in getting the scalps of
“Mexican” Joe Rivers, Ad Wolgast,
Pal Moore, Charley White, and
numerous other fistic luminaries of
his time. Joe’s record also shows
two draws with Johnny Kilbane
and Johnny Dundee.
“The sight of a band of profes-
sional golfers blowing into town for
a tournament reminds one of Cae-
sar and ,his army of spearmen or
knighted warriors "with their weap-
ons,” says Ray McCarthy.
A golf professional probably car-
ries more baggage than any other
kind of athlete and three-fourths of
his equipment consist of utensils
which aid him in gaining a liveli-.
hoo. The other fourth is made up
of attire.
Fellows like Sarazen; Hagen and
Hutchinson give more attention to
their clothes than to their clubs.
Gene invited McCarthy out to see
his garden but he evidently forgot
about the garden, as he spent the
afternoon bringing forth new style
sweaters, knickers, stockings and
shoes.
Jim Barnes is not so particular
as to his attire. Jim is always well-,
groomed but he doesn’t wear the
natty clothes that adorn most pro-
fessionals. Barnes never adopted
knickers and he appears on the
green in white flannels.

TO SCRIBBLERS HOW BOOK
’	IS PREPARED
How; the “Ave Maria,” religious
magazine with a world-wide circu-
lation of 41,000, is prepared for
publication each week in' the Ave
. Maria press, located on the cam-
pus, was explained by Rev. Kerndt

Editor for 50. Years
■ “The Ave Maria, which is a mag-
azine devoted to the Blessed Vir-
gin, was founded 59 years ago by
' Father Edward Sorin,” said Father
Healy.' ".“He was assisted in his
. work by Mother Angela and was
succeeded by Father Gillespie who
edited the magazine, until 1874,
. when the present editor, Rev. D. E.
Hudson, took charge. Father Hud-
soil, this month celebrates the 50th
anniversary of his .editorship, dur-
ing'which time the magazine has
never missed an,issue. •

been printed in book form. Broth-

Many Contributions .
“One of ,the most interesting, de-
partments of the magazine is the
“Contributors’ Box” through' which,
and I believe Father Hudson - has
verified this, hundreds of thousands
of' dollars have been secured for
various charitable causes.”
Father Healy’s talk was the fea-

the reading of papers by James
Withey and Joseph Ryan, and a
