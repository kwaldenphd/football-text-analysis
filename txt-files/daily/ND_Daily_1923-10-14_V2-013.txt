— The- campus- mission^and_the_ .off-
campus mission were ^brought to a
close^yesterda'y. The ■ caihpris7' mis-
sion'ended' with' a' -^Solemn High
Mass,- and the Papal Benediction
was given by Rev. J. W Donahue,
who conducted it. It is. significant
that; it ended on ;the, feast .of St.
Edward,; the patron saint of Fath-
er Edward Sorin, the founder . of
Notre Dame. ;	:	;	:
Rev.. Matthew J. Walsh, president
of : the University, was celebrant of
the closing mass. . Re.v. Thomas Irr
ving was deacon, Rev. oseph Burke,
subJdeacon,: and Rev.: Francis Wen-:
ninger was master of; cereriionies.. :
• Throughout the-mission the num-
ber of communions increased rdaily
until yesterday,, when. a, decrease
was noted, , because so.- many; stu-
dents were, .excused :for the week
end. It was necessary to, place
chairs ;in the' aisles -of .the .church
every night of the/, mission to ac-
cummodate . the- overflow.: f. .;.;	!
. The : off-campus/ mission r, came. to,
an end' yesterday.. morning at St.'
Joseph’s Church, wherirRev. George
Finnegan delivered his concluding
sermon on. “Temptations and -the;
Way:to.Overcome Them.” < ' ■
' Rev. William Lenartz, pastor of
the, church/made..a,short adddress,
in;which he expressed his. approval
of the mission; and tendered his. ap-
preciation .'that ,it. was>held.*;in. his
church.	\	:
The success-of[the. mission is at-
tributed to the * efforts and sacri-
fices made by Father Finnegan, rec;
tor of Holy Cross Seminary. Fath-
er Finnegan was-. assisted in his
work by Rev? Hugh b’Donnell; who
directed the singing, and by Joseph

Number Thirteen Is
Lucky for Rockmen
' Is 13- an unlucky number? Yes-
terday’s game with the Army
wouldn’t seem to indicate that it is.
Coach Rockne’s invariable habit
of wearing a number . “13” on his
jersey in practice has ’.furnished
food for thought for. the super-
stitious. ■	'	■	.
When we add up the letters in
“Notre Dame” and “Army,” the re-
sult is 13. Count ’em. And. when
we put the two teams together on
the .13th of the month, the result is
a 13 score? , ;	-
Incidentally, this story is appear-
ing, in-the thirteenth issue of the

THE MISSION
The Mission at the University' closed yesterday. There were some
who did not attend the services, but they were few in number. They
were not'missed, and, on the Other hand, they missed a great deal.
The fact that Notre Dame missions accomplish so much of what is
aimed at proves two things. The . first is that those who are respon-
- sible for and those who conduct the missions are unusually able. The
second is that the representative Notre Dame man is at heart an
earnestly responsible man.
Credit is due to both the conductors of the mission and to those
who made it a substantial good by their attendance. Those who through
laxity neglected to attend need no upbraiding. They are the losers.
THE CANE GANG
Robert Cortes Holliday is not the only one who concerns himself
with carrying a cane. . At a recent meeting of .the senior class, the sub-
ject was debated very seriously. The seniors, feeling the need of some
distinguishing mark, .are casting about for a device which will set them
apart from the underclassmen .
It has been suggested that all seniors carry canes, but there are a
, few drawbacks to the plan. The tradition, as zis known, belongs to the
Law school, and for the seniors to take it over bodily would not only
be.unjust to that school, but would argue a startling lack of originality
as well.	. :
> . Then, too, there appears to be a prej udice against the cane, through-
out the entire.middle west; it is unreasonable, no doubt, but nevertheless
it exists.' The . spectacle of an apparently able-bodied youth flourish-
ing a cane on the thoroughfare rouses a feeling of pity that is anything
but akin to love on the part of the less fortunate brethren. . The most
serious fault to be found with the system in that the cane carrier is self-
conscious and amateurish. An advisable course to pursue is to have
college students carry canes for four years, and have each class use a
particular type of cane. In this way, by the time the student is a
senior—when he must be sedate and dignified—he will twirl-his stick
with the finesse of the Prince of-Wales, and his manner will then dis-
tinguish him.	*
FA VORITESPOR TSAND THEIR METHODS
John J. Tigert, of whom nobody ever heard before and who has
already dropped back’to his former innoepous niche, managed to make
the headlines last week. According to press dispatches he said: “ . t.
I ain not prepared to point to a single college that is not subsidizing
or paying its athletes, or in which the president is not winking at it.”
We overlook the grammar as possibly having been garbled in trans-
mission.	,	. ; ’ /	-
The point is this broad-gestured indictment—and we can see the
speaker in the act of describing a vicious circle with a fist that shiv-
ered the flag-draped: water-stand—this scathing broadside is entirely
gratuitous. The same withering charge could be made with equal
authority by any first-class bootblack. ■	'
It is truly amazing that without an iota of evidence Mr. Tigert,
who seems to be something in the United States Bureau of Education,
questions the integrity of everybody who happens to be a college presi-
dent and expects his audience to take his own word honor bright. ;
Our only reason for taking cognizance of the volubility of this
member of the U. S. Bureau of Education is the large mass of fable
-and rumor circulated by a band versed in the rich sport of baiting
' college athletics. -	•	’ , ’	;
.We who know bur athletes as roommates, classmates, arid bosom
friends resent .the merest ‘irisiriuation of dishonor. We ardently -admire
the men who represent Notre Dame on the field of sport. . If there- are
any elite on the campus, they are that par excellence. When somebody
says they are “bought,” arraigns them for being prostituted by com-
mercialism, it is time for direct action unless there is incontrovertible
proof. Moreover, those infrequent, instances where individuals deviated
from the code of ethics only add to bur pride in the body of our mono-:
gram men. J ;	■ -	.........	: '

Hooda was out walking with a
friend. They had walked scarcely
a mile before Hooda preceived that
his companion was on crutches.
Half a mile later Hooda had de-
cided that there must' be some rea-
Ison for it. And almost within the
j distance of three blocks after that |
he asked, “You-are lame.” ; I
' “How’s that?” asked his friend,
some hundred feet later..	-
Hooda - was ' silent’ for perhaps
a block and then answered, “I
don’t know, I’m sure.”
His friend mused for eight and
a. quarter rods and then, “You see
I fell over the rear wing—”
“Heavens, don’t tell me the rear
wing,” said Hooda.
His friend thought a few limps
and then said, “Yes, the rear wing.
The rear wing of a bridge.”
” “But wasn’t there any water be-
low it?” asked our hero.
“No,” said the friend, some few
brisk hobbles later: ■ “No; not a
darn drop.” <	;
“I don’t believe you,” saidHooda.
“If there wasn’t any water = there
there; wouldn’t' have been any
bridge. You can’t :fool me., - And
besides that, there was a drop or
how' did’you get hurt?” ■;	' -.
Yesterday Hooda was picking, his
teeth with a sliver that he ex-
tracted from his' head. We, under-

After the preliminary news reel,
they got down to business at the
Palace this last half and showed
what proved to be a very good pic-
ture, “Yesterday’s Wife.” The lead
was played, by Irene Rich, an ac-
tress who does not appear nearly
bften enough. Every role she
’ takes is graced by a note of quiet
dignity which is almost certain to
assure its success. The others in
the cast, Josephine Crowley, Philo
McCullough, Eileen Percy, and
Lewis Dayton, gave the star splen-
did support, the honors going to
Josephine Crowell, who began by
being a villainess of the deepest
dye and finished by being" a sort of
fairy godmother.
The Melville Brothers opened the
vaudeville bill with a clever line of
gymnastics that was a departure
from the usual run of such, turns.
They were followed by Bennington
and Scott, a man and woman, who
sang and danced and did a little
specialty, much to the pleasure of
all concerned. The third number
on the program was the Russian
Trio DeLuxe, soprano, cello, and
piano. All of them distinguished
themselves by their exhibition of
classical and semi-classical music.
The pianist played with skill, but
the two numbers she gave have been
heard so often in vaudeville that
they have little attraction. Zuhn
and Dreis, who have been seen here 1
before, were popular as ever with :
their clever'dialogue..	1
The headliner, The. Seattle- Har- 1
mony Kings, scared the hit of the 1
lows, as any other youth, but be-
cause of the century-tried back-
ground that is behind Notre Dame
• education, he is.not the iconoclast
of the usual university.
This attitude of the Notre Dame
man should be mirrored in his
newspaper. For that reason, THE
DAILY, having begun with too
much blatency, is endeavoring grad-
ually to tone down its style, to be-
come less noisy in its makeup and
tone, so that when it does speak, it
shall be heard. All this, of course,
must be done gradually. .
In line with this change it hopes
to become more human—less of a
journalistic automat that performs
its news’-giving functions mechan-
ically and lifelessly, and more of a
living chronicle of Notre Dame,
aliye and assertive. The new col-
umn, , Campus By-Paths, is one
means by which the paper hopes to
add the personal tone that will
make it more representative.
As far as it is able THE DAILY
will do its best for Notre Dame in-
stitutions. The junior class and
the band were accorded daily pub-
licity for their dances, the grid-
graph announcements were given
prominent position, and all Univer-
sity campaigns will be given as
much space as the campaign seems
to warrant, depending, of course,
on the available space for the day.
