served National-/Education Week

that included several prominent. lo-
cal educators. '

/ The proclamation ofPresident
jCoolidge calling for the observance

18f'as National.- Education ; W
was. read [by?Lecturer Harry Mc-
Guire. The President began: “Ev-
ery American.,citizen is.entitled to
aliberal,: education'. . Without this
there ‘is no /guarantee for. the per-
( manerice of, : free . institutions^ no
[ hope of.-perpetuating self-goyern-
ment.’ Despotism finds; its chief;sup-
port; in ignorance. Knowledge and
friendship go hand in hand.”; j ;.
. Father .= Cunningham., commented
on the’prdclamation of the.president
:. and told explicitly in what; a liberal
education r consists.:. He. • said; that
‘the [grade schools:develop a state. of
.literacy, while the high,,school , be-
. gins ‘ and ^the college broadens.:what
is called, the.,liberal, .education.: ,
<[ [ [ Mf.‘ P./O.Pointer, .principal of the

//Brother Florence,, treasurer [of the
University,'spolce on why the .Cath-
olic ’school exists. The Church
says' that religious education is-es-
sential to the individual and to so-
ciety. ? This', religious /instruction is
given kin [/the Catholic , [church . be-
cause the Church and the! home- can-
not adequately .supply” this need.
He said that great,public issues are
discussed /not; so/, [much. in...public
but jn/such places, as the shops,/the
, ■ ,stores,/ and -the'.factories, . rind'.the
.Catholic-[ should ■ be/.able to.. defend
/ his principles when /called upon; to
; do so/ His knbwledge is to be/se-
cured in the Catholic school. He
said that a great deal, of unfamiliar-
’ ity [ exists ’ asJ ; to-"the / purpose,; and
[work. of, the/teachirig/ brotherhoods.
He stressed' the 'service.-that [the/ sis-
. ters and /brothers are .perform^
teachers and pointed put that this

[Catholic men to enter.
" 1 Then followed a' teh-minute talk
by Dr. , De Baiuw, . professor o/f
French’ in the South /Bend Senior
high school. He made a few re-
‘marks on ’ the .relation of athletics
[to the development ..of the student.
Children want athletics, they are in-
- [forested in them, and by talking on
jWhat interests them the teacher
pyho/knows athletics is a power in
/creating/ a : closer relation between

Died Tuesday of General Debility; .
Was Known for Miracles
He Had Performed.
Brother Columba, known to the
world as. John O’Neill,, died at the
Community infirmary Tuesday
morning, at the age of 75, of gen-
eral debility. He was born at Mac-
keysburg, Pa., November 5,’ 1847.
The [funeral will take place this
morning from the Church of the
Sacred Heart, at 8 o’clock.
Rev.. Joseph Gallagher, C. S. C.,
superior of the community, house,
will be celebrant of the solemn
requiern services, and the Very Rev.
Charles L. O’Donnell, provincial of
the Congregation of the Holy Cross
in the United States, will preach..
Brother Columba sperit the early
days of his life picking slate from
the., mines near his., home and at
the age of 14 was apprenticed to a
shberiiaker. He [ entered the novit-
iate July 9, 1874; after his ribvit-
iate’he wa[s assigned to the college
shoe “'shop/ though he had offered
himself for the Bengal Missions or .
Molaki.- '	.
During the last two years. of life
of Rev. Edward Sorin,. Brother Co-
lumba was his personal ’ attendant.
After the death of Father Sorin he
returned to his duties at the college
shoe/shop, where he continued until
1920. The influenza epidemic of
that year found hirii a victirii and'he
never quite recovered from its at-
tack. The resultant weakness had
much to do with the hurrying of
his death.
..Brother • Columba received much • -
acclaim .thro ugh. his devotion to the >
• Sacred Heart. He was known by
'iriany as ther “Divine Healer” and
as the- “Miracle: Mari- of Notre
. Dame.” ■ He/ however, never claimed
any. credit for cures, which may have
occurred and .no official investiga-
.tiqn was ever, made of such cures.
Concerning. Brother - Columba, a
letter was received at the-office of
THE DAILY yesterday. It followri:
/. “I am .enclosing[a clipping that
should'be of . interest' [to . you and
■your/ staff; . Brother Columba, who
is the subject[of • this clipping, has
but a few more days to live. He.
is slowly passing away in -his hum-
ble roominthecommunity house,
ibeing. cared [for in: his , last hours
;by.the tender.[hands, of his fellow
.Religious. ?, ; [([1:	:-
.: “In- these.; days. when the whole
country is siriging the praise of the -
Notre Dame team, when the student
body is liable to feel that this same
team [exemplifies all that is best and
noblest at the University, a great
arid1 good' service can be done by
showing the students and the? na-
tion that this institution' is builded
. on a; more: solid foundation, a foun-
dation of sacrifice, devotion, charity
to fellow .men.and an undying love
of . the Almighty. God.
.“Thousands of homes in this fair •
land will join in mourning the . de-
parture of. this saintly brother.. He
.has inade - many trips,. to the cities
of the Middle West carrying his'
riiessage of love and/hope. [Hun-
dreds and thousands have found him
here in his humble retreat and be-
sought his prayers for cures of their 1
maladies,- spiritual' and.?• physical,
• and other, thousands have ;sent their
letters asking for [his Sacred Heart
badges, and asking, hirii to-remember
their petition in his prayers. Doz-
ens of letters are arriving each’day
and it was just recently, that a lady
called.on.him, having traveled.here
from. New York. ,	/.	/ ।

are looking for the big thing of his

Since this is our column, we feel
at liberty to use it to advantage.
Therefore we want you to know
that no one has asked us to Thanks-
giving dinner, and the time is draw-
ing horribly near.
Now you must please understand
that this is inerely a news item. We
just wanted you to know. It is
very well to know that talk about
the campus at this time of the year
often (nay, almost always), drifts
around to “Have you been irivited
but to Thanksgiving* dinner?” arid
so since we riever talk to anyone,
we are just telling you conversa-
tionally.
All the' rest of the staff will be
out of town on that day. They all
have invitations. Now wouldn’t it
be nice if some one just came right
up to us and said, “Oh, you- MUST
come down to our house ; for—”
but never mind.
, Our table manners are said to be
quite good and we never have criti-
cised those of others'.

GOOD £/L7MO7?
Break away from the crowd,.be different, be individual; and thus:
be popular. .	-
. 1 These, are the standards of the new generation.
/ Humor in the college fun magazines has been quite immoral. Even
our own dear Juggler dipped a dainty toe into the gutter now r and
then/ (But that, was orice upon a time, maybe last year.) This year
tliie; Juggler..prances ..down the immaculate, way. Walking along the
good way -with the juggler is the! Harvard Lampoon, for its editors
.have,.declared that they also will be good. Coming toward the-same
path is the Medley oi New York University. Off on other paths are
tthe many other humorous zanies, one foot in the. gutter and one on the
proper way, always sb poised that they can transfer their entire inno-
• cent "weight to either foot, according to whether the observer likes the
gutter gallop or the moral meander.
.. ' The Juggler, has always-beeri rather exemplary in its conduct, but
.it is a riew thing to see the Lampoon and the. Medley. prancing along
Svith/the Juggler, they themselves calling,editorial attention to their new
.way.	i' f /' "?? A'/,. . ‘
?. / But—-and the Lampoon tells us the cause of the’sudden inorality:
goodness demonstr a tes.originality,it is ah innovation.
----ON TO PITTSBURGH-------	.
SONS’ ’
/ On. its" return from the Nebraska’game the football teairi received
a most loyal and sincere welcome.; 'We gave it such a welcome because
we know that it had displayed that admirable courage which, does hot
wilt in the face of overwhelming difficulties. We gave'it such a wel-
cbirie because we knew that it was representihg: bur school and her
spirit before the world; arid because we believe that its action in that
contest indicates the action of true Notre Dame men in the contest of
life.. . ”	'...J	... . . .	.■	' .•	.
. A!!•/’.'This,.welcome to the teairi was important because it indicated a
;steadfast loyalty to the University for whose honor it fought. And if
^our football heroes deserve, as they surely do, the inost.hearty support
of; every student, surely . all those who work for tlie common good of
■ the University in other ways deserve some measure of support.
A/ /But The Notre Dame Daily and those who are responsible for
it, have not been accorded complete, support. Nearly a third of the
studerit: body has failed to deriioristrate its support through subscrip-
tions. This attitudej we believe, is one of indifference rather than of
hostility; but*in this case indifference :constitutes almost as effective
/ opposition as would hostility. It is this very attitude of indifference,’
then, which must be removed if The Notre Dame . Daily is, to growl
arid to add to ‘its possibilities of aiding the students and the University.|
A . Tbe mehibers of.’T	staff doAnot seek the support of the
.student body as a personal tribute any more than our athletes regardi
. the cheers, for,the team, as purely!personal-tributes. • Greater;support*
is desired because, the limited finances of the paper have;tied the hands;
; of/its jeditprs. .They find themselves unable to undertake many: projects’
•which mightradd "strength to the paper. They cannot serveA-the studeritlj
body? as - completely as they- would like to, and they. will be unable to’
do so fas long as a considerable proportion .of that body remains indif-’
ferent. The-students should be as much concerned ;for the welfare of:
their paper as any member of the staff, fdr. it is they who will .profit'
from the •'increased1 services which it will'be-able to offer. .	: A
A. The Notre Dame Daily is still young;:but it has already indi-;
cated. that it contains the possibilities of aiding the students in many
.ways. /Information on every subject is obtained by!its readers more
completely than, formerly! Many activities bf the’school which ’were
formerly almost unheard of about the'campus, such as debating' and
other scholastic projects, now receive tlieir proportion of publicity, and
. the response in'interest is already‘noticeable. A . A! ' / A.
: ' The. student also should desire the success (of his paper because,
like the football . team, it must represent his University in its partic-
ular wayi We'assume fthat no one would like to see The Notre Dame
Daily discontinued. - Yet, if we are to have such, a paper, surely we all
wish Ato. have one-which may be‘ranked among the best college publica-
tions. ANotre Dame lias .won the reputation of doirig well whatever it
: undertakes, and ^we'Jhope The Daily will , not be made an/ exception
because of . student nqn^suppdrt. ■ , ,	. /	:	; I
; ■ •, Insofar .as it has been able, we believe that The Notre Dame
! DAiLY/Jms made.;a'creditable ^s^	it has not fulfilled all the
. possibilitieis that should ;be expected in a place where two thousand meri

worst defeat in years, the final
score being 25-2.
Now 25, the points scored by the
Irish, happens to be 12% times
the- total of the two registered by
Princeton. And if Notre Dame,
again utilizing mathematics, was
12% times better than a team that
tied the Navy at 'three points all,
while the Navy in turn was 61
times better than St. Xavier, an
eleven that was twice as good as
St. Louis, which played Missouri
even up and Missouri in turn stag-
ed a tie game with Nebraska, im
order to arrive at the comparative
strengths of Notre Dame and Ne-
braska you’d multiply 2 by 61,
which makes 122’and then multi-
ply this by 12 % which made the
Irish loom up as 1,525 times bet-
ter than Nebraska.
But'here’s a. case in which fig-
ures didn’t mean a continental darn
thing for instead of Notte Dame
being 1,525 times better than Ne-
braska, the Cornhuskers proved
themselves to-,be twice as good as
Notre Dame.
I If you can figure-that one out,
' go to it. We can’t. And as we
said before we can’t blame Knute
Rockne if he has a headache. That
defeat/ and the computation we
have, just set forth" gave us one.
BETWEEN UNIVERSITIES.
. (The Daily Kansan.)
The. fame of Notre Dame. is

Wouldn’t
it be fine if Kansas
could hear such comments about
its spirit? Her tradition of re-
maining in the Stadium after all
games to sing the “Crimson and
Blue” and shout the “Rock Chalk,”
is known, far and wide, but is. she
recognized especially for conduct
toward, strangers from Missouri,
Aggieville, and Lincoln?

YOUR DUTY TO NEBRASKA.
(Daily Nebraskan.)
। It is an abusive and a more or
less unfair subject, but the use of
intoxicants as a means of celebra-
tion of University events is noth-
ing short of deplorable. Homecom-
ing and the recent victory are two
examples that deserve a sweeping
broadside, one that will not men-
tion the physical results, on that
will not mention the mental effects,
but one that concerns the honor of
this institution.
College papers, the. only external
voice of the students of most insti-
tutions, are. expressing.a measure of
alarm and regret that there is sure-,
ly an evil that must be clipped
short and hurled from the very vi-
cinity of educational institutions. -
J Nebraska (for she too must have
her name connected with those of
the offenders), cannot afford to
have her mighty dignity and her
fair, name associated with the de-
plorable habits of those who laugh
; at discretion, assume no responsibil-
ity, and call themselves Cornhusk-
ers.
This is a formative period, this is
a time when ho student can allow
himself to set precedents or follow
customs that not only concern him
but also concern his fellow students.
It is not reform that is needed, it
is not better education, it is merely
a duty to the University of Nebras- <
ka, the institution that every , stu-
dent is proud to claim as his own. .

IRISH LEAVE
FOR CARNEGIE
Rockne Makes Third Trip .East;
Tech.Boasts of Peculiar Shift;
" . Carnegie Prepared.
Rockne’s Fighting team will leave
South Bend at 7. o’clock this , even-
ing for then* third invasion of the
East, and the East is waiting, wait-
ing to see if they are still the Fight-
ing Irish. .	.	L ;
. Captain Brown-and his cohorts
are .going-East to conquer the con-
querors of . Pittsburg, Carnegie
’Tech. Notre Dame is going into
the second last , game of the sea-
son without the. services of the
^greatest running back of the sea-
son, Don Miller.
‘ There will be no sign of- over-
confidence as the team entrains to-
-night, for the Tech gridders have
’been flashing at high speed in the
eastern football realms since the
season opened. , The power of their
, 'attack cannot be . appreciated from
the scores hiing ;up by the Engin?
Jeers’ school this. fall. The Tech
• men have’: piled up 100 points to
their opponents42, • but comparing
Che schedules of Carnegie and Notre
Dame,'there is'no comparison. <
3 The Pittsburg school was held to
'a 6-6 tie by! Detroit, which in turn
•was defeated/ 2 to 0 by the Michi-
,. gan Aggies last Saturday. Carne-
^ie defeated' Pittsburg 7/ to 2, but
lost to W. and J., 7 to 9. In the
‘ game'after the. Pitt encounter, Tech
•lost to Lehigh,; 7 to 13, while Notre
’Dame was -trampling; over Purdue
in the Irish Homecoming attraction.
The first three games' on the Engin-
eers’ schedule : were with light
teams that^served to put the Tech-'
'ers into condition for'the remainder,
- of their season,.- and the .high point;
of their;schedule 'will be their clash:
■with the Fighting Irish next’Satur-
day. __ _	......
z i Like j Nebraska, ’ the -easterners; ■
‘will be primed to the fighting pitch
when Rockne’s proteges begin’ ca-
vorting? around - the ; field., in the
Smoky 'City,’and fans wiirffinTjam-
ming Forbes field by the thousand
to get a glimpse of the Hoosier
. eleven.
’ j Carnegie has a peculiar shift with
great possibilities and one that is
likely to give the. Rockmen a great
amount of trouble. The shift is of
eyen ’ greater .complexity than that
used by Georgia. Tech. In its ex-
ecution it may be either a sweeping
end run with a four-man interfer-
ence, or it may double back1 into a
direct line charge. Furthermore, it
offers ample protection to the pass-
er. The success of the shift will de-
pend on the amount of speed with
which it. is executed. The faster,
the more deceptive.
’ To break up this attack, Rockne’s
linemen are going to have a busy
, 'afternoon, particularly .the ends
whose speed in closing in on the
offensive backfield will, be-the fac-
■ tor upon which the success of the
shift depends.*	• ■ .
j The squad took a long, strenuous
workout against the Carnegie for-
mation, Wednesday afternoon and
the defense enjoyed no small
amount' of success in breaking up,
the attack. v One team worked
against the Frosh in dummy scrim-
mage, with Crowley, Layden and
Maher in the backfield,
' J Last year, the Irish went down to
Pittsburg and ran riot over the
Tech defense* and stopped their
, brilliant attack, which was directed
by the. versatile Robertson, high
point scorer in the East for 1922.
Saturday will be “Red” Maher’s
day to hang up a few points in the
midwestern calendar, and with the
St. Louis game; still to- be rplaye'dj‘
the Madison flash will have an op-
portunity. to equal, the .record of.

Walsh Hall Beats
Goshen, 33 to 0
The Walsh hall football team,
led by Captain Stanhope, defeated
the Goshen Elks, 33 to 0, at Gosh-
en, Sunday afternoon. - The Walsh-
ites completely outclassed the
Elks, -allowing them; but one first
down, "and- crashed their 'defense
with a whirlwind attack that mixed
passes and line plunges.
The Catholic squad scored two
touchdowns on intercepted passes,
the, first of, which led directly to
the Goshen goal. Another counter
was hung up when a Goshen back
fumbled one of Wade Sullivan’s
long punts and a Walsh man fell
on the ball behind the line. ‘
The. punting of Sullivan was the
outstanding feature of the; game, and
time ’after , time the Iowa flash
booted the oval for 65 yards. The
punt that counted for the score was
kicked from Walsh’s 10-yard line.
Sullivan also gave the. Elks a. sam-
ple of “Red ’ Grange stuff when he
was, called upon.to carry the ball.
Captain Stanhope at center and
Ziliack on the, wing were the other
^bright .spots on the/Walsh contin-
gent. Both men displayed a . re-
;m a_r.k.ab L e;.L aggr essiyenes s^an d.
.tackled with savage viciousness on
the defense. 1
The Goshen aggregation far out-
weighed the local squad and sev-
eral times were able to stop the
Irish backs at the line for no gain.
O’Neil, quarter back of the Elks,
made his acquaintance with Notre
.Dame football, when as a. member
of the 'famous Depauw “Mystery
Team,” he played against the Rock-
men in 1921.,

Sacred Heart leaflets, kept distrib-
uting his badges until this has now
become one of the favorite devo-

form, the: Sacred Heart has been
most gracious to him and it but re-

in this weary world, but who can
fortell what the increase will be
when he is united in glory with ,the
Sacred Heart? ■ . ;
“Let us ‘carry on.’
