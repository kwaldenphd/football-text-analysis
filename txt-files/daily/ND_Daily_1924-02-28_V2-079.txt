Senior Ball Plans
Now Completed
At a meeting of the Senior Ball
Committee Tuesday the program
for the ball was completed, but
will he withheld until a later date,
when all arrangements will be an-
nounced. It was stated at the
meeting that all seniors expecting
to invite St. Mary’s, girls must have
the names of their guests given to
the Ball Committee men not later
than March - 4. This requirement
must be fulfilled in order that the
girls may obtain permission for the
ball week. The work of the Senior
Ball Committee will be greatly les-
sened if this request receives
prompt attention.	.
Notre Dame-Minnesota baseball
games on May 22 and 23, and the
Indiana state meet May 24, which
may be held in N. D., will help to
make the ball week more entertain-
ing.
INTERHALL TRACK
BEGINS TONIGHT
Half the Events Run Off This
Evening; Others Next Week;
Medals and Cup Given.
The lid will come off of the In-
terhall track season when the first
half of the preliminary events are
run off in the local gym tonight at
7:30. The events on the first part
of the program include the 40-yard
dash, 440-yard run, mile run, 40-
yard low hurdles, shot put, and high
jump.
The first eight men to cross the
finish will be qualified to compete
in the finals which will "take place
March. 9:Gold, silver ;and. bronze
medals will be awarded for all four
places in the final meet.
The second part of the prelims
will be staged March 5, ^t 7:30 in
the evening and will. include the
220-yard run, half mile, two mile,
40-yard high hurdles, pole vault,
and broad jump. Varsity track
men are ineligible for the events.
A dual meet has been scheduled
fpr the Frosh team with the track-'
sters from Western State Normal.
The meet will be run off in the lo-
cal gym March 13, at 4 o’clock in
the afternoon.
Varsity Baseball
Men Start Practice
The candidates for the battery
positions of the baseball team are
working out daily under the tute-
lage of Coach Keogan. zThe best
basketball team that has represent-
ed Notre Dame in years has been
turned out by Keogan this season,
and great things are expected of
him in baseball. Mageveny is the
only varsity moundsman remaining
from last year’s squad, but McGrath
and Strange, substitutes of last
year, are expected to develop so
they may take a regular turn at
hurling. Noppenberger, Dawes,
Dwyer, O’Sullivan, Sturgis, Steel,
and Antone, are also strong possi-
bilities for the box position.
Bill Gerney is the only catcher
who has earned a letter, but there'
is a wealth of good material on
hand; Eddie Welch and Hurley, of
last year’s squad, are back, and Jim
Silver and Nick Smith loom up as
strong candidates. These two were
prominent in interhall, baseball last
season, and will force the other,
candidates for the backstop berth
to the limit. Sweeney, the former
Freshman hall catcher, is also a
promising prospect.
The call for all candidates has
not yet been issued, but spring
training will, get into full swing as
soon as the basketball season is
over.
ROCKNE SAYS:	(
' Coach ’ K. k. Rockne again asks
that no students feed the mascot,
“Terry,” as he has been sick and
requires a special diet. It is said
“Terry is improving rapidly and
will soon be in good shape.
FROSH FROLIC
TOMORROW EVE
Novelty Favors Promised; Men Es-
corting St. Mary’s Girls Meet
Them at 8:45 o’clock.
The Freshman Frolic will be
held tomorrow night at the Palais
Royal, where dancing will continue
from 9 till 1 o’clock. Two o’clock
permissions have been granted to
all students who attend the dance.
Music will.be furnished by “Husk”
O’Hara’s orchestra, one of the best
in the country.
A big surprise is in store for the
girls in the line of favors, accord-
ing to the committee in charge. The
men escorting St. Mary’s girls are
to meet them in the LaSalle hotel
promptly at 8:45.
Day students who have not as yet
purchased their tickets may do so
at the _ off-campus office. Others
may secure tickets in their respec-
tive halls. The ticket sale has been
unusually heavy, and from all in-
dications a record crowd will at-
tend.
The following patrons have been
announced: W. E. Farrell, K. B.
Smith, F. Kervick, J. A. Capara, R.
M. Kaczmarek, J. F. Hines, J. 0.
Plauto, and J. Corona.
Carroll, Brownson,
Freshman, Badin Win
There were many exciting races
staged in the interhall relays Tues-
day. Corby lost a hotly-contested
race with the fast Freshman hali-
ers, who made the time of 1:37 1-5,
and . ' Carroll nosed out Walsh
through brilliantrunning of _B.arrqn.
Brownson . defeatedr-the' Day-Dogs,
and Badin forfeited to the proteges
of Father Gassensmith, in the other
races. . .
The relays have created much in-
terest and competition, and each
week produces improvement' in
nearly every team. The Sopho-
more and Freshman Hall sextets
are tied for the league lead, while.
Corby, Carroll, and Frownron arc

COACH ROCKNE
ADDRESSES K.OFC.
Rockne Emphasizes Importance of
Team Work in All Activities;
Knocks Faultfinders.'
Coach Knute K. Rockne, ih, an
address to the members of Notre
Dame Council, Knights of Colum-
bus, Tuesday night, emphasized the
importance of athletics as a part of "
a college curriculum, and spoke of
the character building qualities of
football. He complimented the
Notre Dame Knights upon their
work, and scorned those individu-
als “who never do anything. them-
selves but constantly find fault
with the fellows who do.” Roger
Kiley, a protege of Rockne arid an
old Notre Dame man who is now
coaching at Loyola, was present
and gave a short talk.
“The average high school boy,” ,
said Coach .Rockne, “is rattle- -
brained. His education is super-
ficial. He has not the capacity to
think of a single thing for more .
than one minute' without getting a
headache. When he comes to col-
lege. he begins to realize the value
of concentration. I can think of
no better place for the teaching of
that concentration than on the foot-
ball field.
“Out there every man must think
of the one thing he is playing. The
thought of his best girl or the next
dance must never enter his mind
while he is in the game. On the
field a man learns things, which the
class-room sometimes fails to sup-
ply. He learns the great lesson of
fairplay and he is taught to have
respect for the other man’s ideas.
He learns also the lesson of humil-.
ity :	'	.. .
“There are no stars on the grid-
iron. Newspapers give publicity to
the men who carry the ball. They
forget the- work of the men who
perform the menial-tasks, the men
without whom the scoring machine
would fail to bring results. The
man on,a football team must stifle
all ideas of . self-aggrandizement.
He comes to realize the value of
team work, which as well as con-
centration arid, fairplay, can be. ap-
plied to his work following grad-
uation. Football makes him a bet- -
ter man and a better citizen.
“The president of an Eastern
college has been quoted as saying
that the system of football is all
wrong and that siflee neither the'
player nor spectators derive any
benefit from the game it should be
abolished. He contends that play-
ers are mere automatons moving at
the (will of the coach, that no men-
tal effort on their part is involved.
He is entirely wrong. Every man
on the Notre'Dame squad knows
that his resourcefulness is relied
upon and he does not have to wait
for me to press a button before he
moves.
“What does the student body get
from football? I hold that the men
in the stands learn to appreciate
fairplay. Men who watch a con-
test played fairly and squarely de-
velop a high standard of sports- ,
manship and that is: a iriighty fine ‘
thing. You won’t find any bigot-
ry, intolerance or narrowminded-
ness where you find clean sports- •
manship. Cheering the team , on to
victory is another fine, thing. . It
adds color to college life.
“I think the college president is
mistaken when he says that foot- .
ball should be abolished. Football,
due to its popularity, pays for all
the other college sports. If we
were to abolish football we must
abolish all other athletics. Ariy
curriculum which does not include

Reader, must you taste
This same sweet cadence,
Live the violent loves,
Pitch deep purple tents?
Lo, he quickly casts a spell
Of magic round
Until your sanity is bathed
. In melody of sound.
Entranced, enraptured, lost
Become; forget and die
To be reborn and cleansed
In his decadent sky!
In the rhythm of each line
Chants some voice divine;
Singing as a hidden linnet,
With the breath of God within'
it.

POLITICAL APATHY
With the Teapot Dome investigation arousing a nation-wide inter-
, est in political figures, it may appear paradoxical to refer to political
apathy. It is,.however, most pertinent to refer to it since its existence
is one of the things which make such scandals possible. Corruption of
officeholders need never be a cause of astonishment as long as a great
' portion of the electorate remains indifferent in political matters.
Even Alexander Hamilton, who certainly was no radical “man of
• the people,” told the convention that framed the constitution that the
government being set np must depend for its successful working upon
the interest,, participation and cooperation of , the people.
? :' But do we find the American people of today giving such support
to their government?	■	■
. Looking back over-the election. statistics for 1922 one is amazed
to find that Florida then returned a senator by a vote representing
• nine per cent of its eligible voters; while Mississippi chose its senator
with only;seven per cent of the voters Taking the trouble tozcast a ballot.
There might, however, be some excuse for such disinterest in those
states wThefe-The-T,esuIt^'Mia'n-electipn:ris~a<foregbnc-co	.a'
similar apathetic condition is rioted in states in which ,the result is;
frequently doubtful. "In 1922 less than one half of New York’s five:
million eligible voters/cast a ballot; In Massachusetts Senator Lodged
1 was reelected by a. vote of 414,00.0, although 1,855,000 voters might
have participated. Similarly Senator Reed, of Missouri, in a campaign:
..which was supposed to be unusually stirring, needed, only 506,000’
. votes out. of a possible two million to win.	-
; Such figures tell the story of; the narrow, basis of representation
bn-‘which our/government at'Washingtom rests. Government has been1
delegated to a ininority. Officeholders are frequently elected by the
.organized electors, that is, by those representing a self-seeking class
of politicians. The electors who have no interest to serve, who expect
nothing and want. nothing from the government for theinselves—those
who‘might be called the. best, citizens—fail to vote. In most, if not
.in all states, these unorganized voters are. in_ a majority; they 'could;
control.elections. Instead they stay away from,the polls and allow
, the active minority, to have its way; .
/ ' .Statistics cannot show the number of college graduates who are
in the group of citizens who fail to vote. Judging, however, from thq
lack of • interest manifested by many college students in: the matters
of'class elections and of class and organization meetings, one may feel
, safe in supposing that a large number of them do not even keep their
names bn the lists of registered-voters in after life. .
Yet the college graduate, above airmen, should know that voting is
a duty as well as a privilege, and that good govefriment depends upon
the fulfillment of this duty. In June our colleges and universities will
very likely graduate over one hundred thousand men arid women? It
would indeed be encouraging to those who believe in democratic gov-
ernment to’feel that this large group of graduates would. exercise its
full voting'power, and would use iits whole influence-to diminish the
• longstanding, evil of political apathy.
—Francis Collins Miller.
O--O
Never the Twain -Small Meet, Peter B.
Kyne. Cosmopolitan Book Corporation,
New York. $2.00. 1923.
When Peter B. Kyne first bowed
to his audience some years ago with
the “Cappy Ricks” stories, he fixed
himself permanently (as permanent-
ly as any contemporary novelist
can be said to fix himself with the
fickle reading public) in a stratum
of fame. His workmanship—crafts-
manship, rather—in, “Never the
Twain Shall Meet,” exceeds any
that he has thus far exhibited. In
his preceding works the very aroma
of life, the flashy dodging from in-
cident to incident, . his. hurried but
subtle treatment, carries his nar-
ratives over in an overwhelming
conclusion.
But there is always a turning
point with the rising author. He
comes to the position where he may
polish,, where, he. may make litera-
ture of a sort, rather than four-
cent-a-word reading matter. Kyne
has reached precisely this juncture.
The sea and San Francisco, . with
their traditions and stifled, loves,
form a background, while Kyne
makes his usual and accepted on-
; ; HALL MAIL BOXES
. Another .problem for the S. A. C. and the hall rectors to think
’ about at this time:—a problem which has been raised at different times
and from different sources—is that of distribution of the mail in the
halls.1 ’ Notre Dame has advanced (old saying) in many, many : ways
' since 1910, but' the method of distributing the morning, noon, and
afternoon mail has'remained the same. Of late, loss of mail'and the
inconveniences caused by having to be bn hand at certain appointed
times for the distribution of mail has brought up again the question of
j the-practicability’.-.of having individual hall maiL boxes, where mail for
■ the students residing in the hall .could be placed? This box system, in
addition to,bringing about greater 'security for. precious, letters,' would
give the student an opportunity, to get his mail even’ though he should
sleep over in the morning, or even, though' he would not shoW. up for
the “mail, bell” at four-thirty.. ' ?
•^'Letters are too’,valuable,/too precious to the student, to have them
endangered by Being, tossed carelessly, on-the. desk of his rector for
everyone to examine. They are' too much in demand to have, them'kept
for him for‘hours because, the rector’s': office is closed;.. They, are, very!
often, too'essential to livelihood to be?lost. Mail boxes properly worked
out would do away, with these dangers;; and it might save us much
/ ungainly scrambling, and our rectors much arm power.
U . Love, is an irresistible something which cannot be resisted without
resistance.	.	’	. •
What Others Say
______■ ■ • - •• • •_______________
■ 'ThTrty-EigKtStuderits Had a
Conference
Probably "you heard that there
was a Student Volunteer meeting
held on our campus during the
post-examination period. And if
reports are ' true, drastic steps
should be taken to prevent any re-
currence. of such a silly and idiotic
thing in the future. Already the
•publicity of , those lily ' livers who
voted to refuse to fight for. their
country (under any circumstances
has;.bid fair to exceed the harm
done by the Leighton Mount fracas
in the.Chicago-press.
The Student Volunteer mover
ment was advertised as a confer-
ence in’ which student problems
would be the chief, interest of dis-
cussion. The superficial motive
seemed admirable and worthy
enough to be attractive to. those
who had nothing else to do in the
meantime. It is commendable for
college students to devote ser-
ious thought .to the major probleins
of our day, but when such devotion
to altruism assuiries the complexion
of rank', imbecility" it is time for
more earthly minds to- call a halt,
especially when the opinion of some
•thirty-eight pacifists, who like ■ the
poor are always with us, is flouted
to the reading "public as the essence
of ..student thought on Northwest-
ern’s campus. Of course there is
the right of free speech arid free
thought. Nobody is tryirig to trans-
gress upon fundamental rights, but
when "the action of a microscopic
minority conspires to be the stan-
dard criterion of the majority, we
who believe more practically upon
social probleins are chafed rawly.
There is no place on Northwest-:
ern’s campus for any one; but
Americans!, Those theroists whose
far distant vision senses the com-
ing of Utopia, with social equality
of races, peace, and . consequent
remedy of all-social- evil? have no
business at Northwesterri seeking
common "sense education. . Scott
Nearing and his ludicrous associates
have the right kind of a. school for
these pacifists and disciples of
Marxian creed—the School' of So-
cialism in New York Gity. But it
will be no source of- pride for
Northwestern to send transfers to
this institution.. ’ , .
Jn spite -of ‘this galling incident
it is consoling to realize that, the
slaughts on conventions, as only a
master can.
Kyne is not out of his native ele-
ment on the sea, he is most truth-
fully “in it,” for he spent many
years as a ship chandler and knows
the lure of the brine from first
hand.
•Two women, Tamea, a half caste,
and Masie, an American girl, are
engaged in capturing a bachelor of
thirty-five, who is, perhaps, torn be-
tween an equal affection for each.
Tamea fights in the open, savagely
and primitively, and Masie, much in
the same manner, curbed, however,
by the conventions of civilization.
Both characterizations are well
drawn.	■
At the best, “Never the Twain
Shall Meet” is light fiction, but well
done. Any lasting qualities that

Robert E.. Sherwood, the moving
picture critic of Life, has recently
published Something new in the line
of collections'. Sherwood is per-
haps the best “movie reviewer” in
the business. There is none of the
gushy sentimentalizing over the
stars in his- articles; they are all-
essays with a particular moving
picture as a subject and written in
that humorous vein that a serious-
ness of purpose exacts of a critic.
His collection, “The Best Moving
Pictures — 1922-23,” published by
Small, Maynard is a comprehensive
review of two seasons of pictures
and for anyone interested in the
movies it is an admirable collection.
Sherwood is a writer of -ability, his
criticisms are always trenchant and
worth reading merely, as critical es-
says apart from the interest of
their subjects.	.
majority, of Northwestern .students
have become incensed with anger at
such slander. Let us hope that the
public will .weigh this publicity with
the proper bias for the real: truth
of the situation. Just as the United
States; must not be judged by the
actions of Brookhart,. La Follette,'
and Len Small, so Northwestern
should not be judged by these Pla-
tonic dreamers,,opiated with .social-
istic drugs arid motivated by hallu-
cinations of doctoring the world.—

It is much more difficult, of
course to set an examination of this
kind. . And it is harder still to
mark the papers. according to one
of thees official marking standards
which delight the bureaucrats ‘ of
pedagogy and are the bane of all
good teachers.
Examinations and marking and
grades and standards and all the
rest of the claptrap apparatus which I
obscures thextrue apparatus of edu- 1
cation may be a necessary evil for
youngsters who have to be wheed- .
led and threatened. But college
men are either beyond that .or they
should not be in college.
The worth-while examinations do .
not. test what a man knows, but
how he knows it. What he knows
for examination purposes he is. like-
ly to forget. The way he knows it
reveals . his mental quality, the
strong and the weak’ side of his
brain; Every . examination should
be an intelligence test. . The result
of such tests will help ' meh to
choose the way of life for which
they are best fitted.—Brooklyn

Writer Sees All Sorts of Scarfs at N. D.
Suggests Scribblers Adopt Them for Insignia
There is more than a tint of
truth in the words, broadcasted by
a couple of cronies on the Campus
By-Paths the other day:	•
“Yoo Hoo Red! Looka the scarf
thet fellows wrapped up in! Pret-
ty nifty, eh?” and Red came back:
“Say, talk about local color; there
you get it Izzy, color, romance and
local, all in one pop'.” ■	;
“Yawtei* see mu scarf-—Gee, it’s
a lolly-pop!” To which .Red re-
joined:	“Yah,------’Tension you
smudger of the King’s Yinglish,
here comes your English Prof.”
Scarfs are fast becoming indis-
' pensible fixtures to every best-
dressed man on the campus, and are
becoming so by all means, which
generally include fair and foul.
But, there is very little foul play
•at Notre Dame, and the case of the
Carrollite who so generously parted
with the top portion of his bed blan-
ket to clothe the throat of a scarf-
less roommate is to be commended
and referred to St. Peter’s chapter
on Corporal Works of Mercy.”
With the acquisition of two
scarfs, the marginal utility of a
scarf has its limitations until an
ingenious roomy learns to utilize
the extra scarf in gagging a neigh-
boring phonograph to insure his
private' concert against the ravag-
ing intrusions of hobo strains that
so'frequently deluge the College
subway. . . . And, roomy set his
clock on 6 o’clock the eve of Dollar
' Day to get to the downtown scarf
venders before his neighbors got
wise. •	.	.
There are, at Notre Dame, des-
cribable 'scarfs and many that tan-
talize describers. “Joe College”
came: on from the North Country
with a crepe-de-chine choker,
fringed with canary blue and
stamped with elephantine Japonicas.
Of all faddists, a Highlander
barely gained admission to the
School of Agriculture tricked out in
a lavender-plaided all-Scotch -neck
and breast protector, while a man
seeking admission wore one
. stamped with botanical specimens
which prompted . the question
-whether he-be lopking for\the -Cbl--;
lege Botanists.'
Spanish scarfs, Italian scarfs,
■Portugeuse, Scotch and many oth-
er brands are among that commod- .
ity at Notre Dame, but, perhaps the j
funniest of neck gears-ever seen at
. Notre Dame is owned by a Corby
commercial man -who spells his
name with' the -ky appendage at the
end: of it. His scarf is - done in
hieroghyphics a la Tut, symbols,
and an admixture of gaudy totem
signs, of. perhaps the Aztec or Incas/
and is fleeted with obtuses that the
philosophers might term, a- flicker
effect. r It is not a bad. attempt at
representing the inner working of
a gyroscope,—-the psychology of
the thing is .that its streaks, flicker-
ing and tapering . progressively
downward, “get attention.” .
- Howbeit, as every Notre Dame
man knows, the scarf is a romantic
and altogether fitting symbol of the
young writing blood of; Notre

“ ■ the incomparable fountain drink
Dame. Scarf, is a child of an Old
French word, scharpe, crisp; hence,
written, printed, or engraved mat-
ter. And, The Scribblers do not
overlook the fact that scarf, rubs
shoulders with the words script,
scriptum, scribo, scribe, and scrip-
tus, all meaning approximately
write or the task of writing. This
fact is strengthened by the artistic
scarfs wrapped about the necks of
scribbling men of Notre Dame.
The synonym, muffller for scarf,
intro<yices other processes and sug-
gestions of literary moment. Muf-
fler eminates from moffet, a kind
of mitten, (with the birth of the
radiator however, scribblers have
generally dispensed of mittens),
hence, a mitten for the throat and
the. lungs. ■	' • ' '
Mitten, in turn, is an offspring
of the French, mitaine, meaning a
cover for the hand. Thus, is woven
a chain of literary, auxiliaries from
the tendrils of the word scarf j and
we have: script, scrip, -write, escript,
scriptum, scribes, mitten; hand;
pointing out that the word scribo,
near • kin to scribe, ‘is no poor
tribesman to scribblers.
Why then, as someone has sug-
gested: “Why not depart from the
method the literary woman had to
advertise that she was a scribbler
(by wearing a quill in her hat),
and why not have a specially de-
signed scarf (which as the word
illustrates is quite as much a lit-
erary figure as is the quill), to des-
ignate and distinguish The Scrib-
blers of Notre Dame from other
writers? A woolen one could be
worn in winter and a silken one in
summer.” '	*	'

BUSY WEEK-END
FOR VARSITY MEN
Trackmen Return to Illinois for
Relays; Aggies Entertain Loop-
men; Outdoor Schedule.
The last week-end in February
will find both the Notre Dame bas-
ketball team and a squad of track
men engaged in foreign competi-
tion; the Maylmen playing a return
game with the Michigan Aggies at
Lansing, and Rockne and his track-
sters competing-in the annual Illi-
nois relay- carnival at Urbana. .
• The basketball team should have
no great difficulty in polishing off
the Farmers on their home floor,
after they were beaten Tuesday
night by' St. Viators. The Aggies
played ragged ball when they ap-
peared here, but the irregularities
of basketball dope are apt to reveal
the Aggies in fighting trim.
The mammoth relay carnival at
Urbana will be the country’s track
classic for the winter season. A
.great number of universities, col-
leges and prep schools will be en-
tered, and from all indications, sev-
eral records are slated to be' re-
modeled.	‘	‘
Notre Dame will-" find her teams
hard pressed by some of the high
class track teams that are entered
by one or two of the conference
schools, but for the most part, the
Blue and Gold will be able to handle
the rest of the field.
Unquestionably one of the most
interesting features of the meet will
be the speed events which will un-
cover all the hidden' stars in the
conference and out of it. Illinois,
Michigan and Iowa will have to be
reckoned with by all the other en-
trants since the runners from these
three schools stand out as among
the best in tlie. country today. Il'i-
nois has Ayers, Evans and Kayle.
Michigan has Wittman and Hub-
bard,. the latter winning the cen-
tury in the conference outdoor last
year. Combining this group with
the .entrants from such;.schools as
Purdue, Kansas and Nebraska' from
which will come Maddox, Irwin,
Noble and Locke, last year’s rec-
ords are certain to be bettered.
Notre Dame stepping into this co-
terie of stars, will see some ex-
traordinary, speed, but the Blue and
Gold tracksters can ' be depended
upon to do their best to hold their
own.
In announcing the following
schedule, for the spring track sea-
son, Coach Rockne stated that ef-
forts were being made to bring the
Indiana State meet to Notre Dame
next May. .	; -

N.D. TANKMEN TO
MEEHNDIANA
First Big Splash of Year; Minor
Monograms Presented to
Team. .
Notre Dame’s varsity swimmers
will, meet the Indiana University
tankmen in the initial college meet
of the season at the South Bend
public natitorium Saturday, March
8. According to Coach Goss this
will be the first time that the Irish
swimmers have ever opposed a col-
lege team in this sport at South
Bend.
The Bloomington squad is well
known throughout the state and in
Big Ten tank circles. They have
produced swimmers of champion-
ship calibre for several years, and
many of the best water performers
of Indiana are on this season’s
squad at the state institution.
At a meeting in room 123 of the
Main Building Wednesday the men
were picked to begin the final
round of training for the Indiana
contest. In the meet with the South
Bend Y. M. C. A. at the beginning
of the year, and in the recent, en-
gagement against the Fort Wayne
Y. M. C. A., in which the team held
the more experienced. “Y” to a 34-
34 tie, the Notre Dame swimmers
have shown their ability. The var-
sity is expected to push the highly
touted downstaters to do their best
in the coming contest.
As a special feature of the Indi-
ana meet, a game of water basket-
ball will be held between the two
schools. The Notre Dame team
was organized a short time ago and
is as yet of somewhat unknown
strength. Coach Goss recently an-
nounced that any swimmers who
wish to try out for the water bas-
ketball team may do so if they
make their application at once, as
the team that will oppose Indiana is
to be picked in a few days.
Coach K. K. Rockne has an-
nounced that members i of the
varsity swimmers that win a first in
the meet will be awarded a; minor
monogram. These monograms will
be the first that have been given at
the school in swimming. The new
uniforms for the team have been dis"
'.ributed to the various members.
These jerseys are blue and white
with a blue monogram , in the cen-
ter, and the trunks are of solid
blue.	‘
Further particulars of the meet
with Indiana will be announced, in
a few days.	. .	. .	.

athletics is unbalanced. The pres-
ident paradoxed his argument for
the abolishment of football some-
time ago when he said that ‘a man
who is physically fit may go wrong
but he can always come back’.”
Speaking of the conditions at
Notre Dame, Coach Rockne called
attention to the work of the var-
ious organizations which are aiding
the University and complimented
the band, Glee club, debating teams,
and the men who participate in
campus activities.
“We have here,” said Rockne,
“much for which other schools envy1
us. We have had a successful sea-
son. But if we are to keep Notre
Dame what-she is, the greatest uni-
versity in America, we must work
hard. We are competing with great
institutions and should we allow
ourselves to become self-satisfied,
‘dry rot’ will set in and we will be
lost. There are many of us who
are ’too self-satisfied.
“We have too large a percentage
of students who do nothing but
criticize. In the jungle there are
two beasts. One is the killler who'
slays, eats what he wants, and goes
his way. The other is the jackal
who follows him and eats what is
left and then probably criticizes
the killer for not leaving enough.

“All of us have our faults and it
is easy for anyone to criticize the
fellows who are trying to do some-
thing. But instead of doing this,
why not look for the good points in
the other man? *
dIf you have any ability at all,
stop moaning and knocking. Get
out and do things. If you can run,
go out for track; if you can sing
get in the Glee club; if you can
argue go out for debating; if you
can write get on the DAILY or
Scholastic. Do something and you
won’t have to worry about ‘dry rot*
setting in.”
Coach Rockne predicted that in
ten years many of the big state
schools would not have Greek letter
fraternities; “Where you have a
• black-ball organization,” he said,
“you have an organization that is
killing democracy. Notre Dame is
thoroughly democratic... Nobody
here cares who your father is or
who you are. What we are inter-
ested in is what you can do.”
Coach Kiley, following Rockne,
spoke briefly about the work of the
Knights of Columbus in Chicago
and told of the high esteem in
which a member of Notre Dame
Council was 'held in that city. ■ ’
