IN BRIEF 
Halloween is Jayne Ware's time to howl, so to speak, because it's about the only time of year she finds a big audience for talk about her line of work: ghostbusting. The vanity license plate on her van says "GHOSTBUS," and her business card says "Granny Ghostbuster" alongside 'Parapsychologist." For most of the year, Mrs. Ware says she does serious investigation at the request of people who have "unexplainable happenings" in their buildings. But around Halloween, "people usually expect me to make a fun thing out of it, so I go along with the idea," she said, laughing. "These are about the only two weeks of the year I talk about 'ghosts.' The rest of the year, during research and for lecture purposes, I prefer to call them 'energies' or 'vortexes."' -Associated Press

INSIDE COLUMN 
Halloween has taken on an evil meaning 
Halloween... a night for investigating the "dark side" of life. It's a night on which groups of people get together to swap horror stories visit graveyards, and hold seances with th~ hopes of contacting the dead or not-so-dead. The facination with the unexplained and the unknown has become an integral part of what happens on this holiday. However, it was not always this way in the past. 
The word "Halloween", which stems from the word "All Hallows Eve", began as a night in which the deceased heros and loved ones were remembered and their lives were cele­brated. The tradition of the time was to act out the many adventures of their lives by dressing up as the hero and putting on skits describing the battles and bravery of their lives. This was continued to the next day, "All Saint's Day", in which the faithful would celebrate the saints which had devoted their lives to the service of God. 
As time went on, the evil characters became just as prominent as the heroes and soon practi­cal jokes took place among the children. The now popular form of trick-or-treating was a method of quelling the children and keeping the mischeif to a minimum. However, as the adults began to join the more mystic activities, the evil side of the evening became popular. 
Today, the facination with evil has become an everyday occurrence in books, magazines, and filmmaking. Writers such as Stephen King explore horrifying events which would nor­mally seem impossible, but after reading his works seem to be happening just around the corner. Horror magazines including "Fan­gora", showing monsters and victims with a great deal of blood and guts, are found on most bookstore shelves. The most famous of all media displaying this is the motion picture. Bil­lions of dollars are made each year on mindless flicks starring ghouls, goblins, ghosts, lunatic axe murderers, aliens from outer space, and even usually harmless animals such as birds, ants, frogs, and most ordinary house pets. 
If all of this is mere fantasy, then why is the subject is so popular? It has to do with the "dark side" within all of us. This is the same force which makes you wa~t to jump when looking over a high ledge, or ride the highest, fastest roller coaster in the world. This adventurous spirit creates an adrenalin high which can be just as good and just as addicting as most drugs. 
Mark Ridgeway r n 
Systems Manager 

Seeing a movie in which every minute most people would be frightened to a near-death point can show off your courage, bring others closer, and boost your ego without actually risking your life. However, it seems that most of today's movies deal so much with reality that paranoia is an evident result. 
The last reason has to do with mere curiosity. The unknown usually does not stay unknown for long because of this instinctive feeling. We hold seances to see if ghosts do exist and to learn if contact with dead spirits is possible. We also explore the possiblities of monsters of this world or some other in the hopes that all species are not yet accounted for. 
As an adult, looking at the way Halloween is today, I feel that the true meaning of the night has been lost, but that the fun of the celebration has not been lost. There are still costumes which depict courageous heros and beautiful prin­cesses, and cute little boys and girls, dressed as pumpkins and cowboys, who still enjoy the mystery and magic of Halloween in the sense it was meant to be when the tradition first began.

Marcos on trial in US for stealing 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Former Philip­pine first lady Imelda Marcos arrived by luxury jet and limousine along with her en­tourage Sunday to face ar­raignment on federal charges she and her husband looted their homeland of $100 million. 
The Marcoses were indicted Oct. 21 on charges they em­bezzled more than $100 million and used it to buy New York real estate, art and other prop­erty. If convicted on the main racketeering charge, they could receive up to 20 years in prison. 
Defense lawyers convinced 
U.S. district Judge John Keenan that Marcos, 71, was too frail to make the 9-hour flight. His arraignment was postponed at least until a government physician examines him. 
Defense lawyers have said Mrs. Marcos, 59, would plead innocent. 
Willy Paderon said Marcos, whose 20-year rule was ended by a military-civilian revolt that lifted Corazon Aquino to power, was abandoned by the United States. 
'We wanted to show Mrs. Marcos and President Marcos that there are Filipinos who still support them," Paderon said. "I hope they will be vind­icated of all these politically motivated charges that are coming left and right."

Ghosts roaming Cline Ave. in Ind. 
Associated Press 
EAST CHICAGO, Ind. -Years ago a woman's two children drowned along the banks of the Calumet River. Now her spirit returns each Halloween to search, but she never seems to find them. 
So goes one version of the story of the Cline A venue Ghost, who, along with a differ­ent apparition known as the Cudahy Ghost, roams a popular haunting strip along Cline Avenue. 
Charlie Tinkham, a 59-year­old Hammond resident and professor at Purdue University-Calumet, said there are several versions of why these ghouls continue to stalk one of Indiana's most danger­ous highways. 
Another version portrays the ghost as a broken-hearted soul who supposedly went to the river to kill herself. 
Yet another adaptation has the ghost nagging her husband so incessantly to return to their old neighborhood in West Gary that he killed and buried her there.

And then there's the other spirit that haunts Cline Ave­nue. 
Every year a crowd ranging from dozens to hundreds gat­hers near the Calumet River west of Cline A venue to spot the Cudahy Ghost, Tinkham said. 
This spirit, also a woman, was supposed to have taken a taxi ride to a Mexican neigh­borhood in East Chicago some­time around Halloween of 1966. The cabdriver took her to the address and, after dropping her off, realized she hadn't paid her fare. 
He returned to where he'd left her. But the matronly lady answering the door denied seeing his passenger. She later brought out a photo of her daughter, which the cabbie recognized as his passenger. 
"She's been dead for years," said the woman. 
Tinkham said the tellers of this story always claim it's true. 
"The truth is that there are stories like this in every major American city," he said. "It's a very popular urban legend "

Service enhances a theology class 
Editor's Note: Students interested in taking Theology and Community Ser­vice should go to the Center for Social Concerns to pick up a learning Agree­ment before Nov. 7. There will be a meeting for all interested students on Monday, Nov. 7 at 4:15p.m. at the CSC. 
It is special when a student has a chance to take a class that offers a new way of thinking about the world and the people in it. Even more rare is the op­portunity to participate in a class which stimulates change in the way a student reacts to his or her environment. As difficult as these classes are to find, Notre Dame offers one in particular that has given its students the chance to develop and cultivate more than book learning. This class enables a student to experience the chapters of text and incorporate the ideas into weekly tests of values, faith, and incorporate love. The class to which I am referring is Theology and Community Service, and the type of knowledge the student leaves the class with is invaluable. 
Laura Shemer 
guest column 
Hearing the name, Theology and Community Service, one is hardpressed to find a relationship strong enough to merit a semester course. Once the general terms are des­cribed, however, it becomes easy to un­derstand the complimentarity of the two. The community service involved 
ND represses religious diversity Dear Editor: 
The year of cultural diversity is one of the most important developments in recent Notre Dame history. Everyone on campus should profit enormously from the efforts being made. 
There is, however, one curious omis­sion from the program. That is the whole are of religion which, in America certainly, is one of the most important areas of cultural diversity. I find it most strange that this vital area of diversity has been blanked out entirely whereas other universities take it most serious­ly. 
in the course is a a 45-minute visit to two residents of a South Bend nursing home per week. No regulations bind the visitor to certain procedures during their visits. Instead the students are provided with creative freedom for whatever activity they think would most enhance the relationship with their "old person." Often times this in­cludes playing bingo or cards, sharing photos and anecdotes about each other's families, or just sitting and holding hands. The emphasis of the community service aspect is for the stu­dent to serve his or her elderly person in whatever capacity they need, while concentrating on how it feels to be ef­fective and ineffective in fulfilling the "old person's" needs. 
Now the theology part. What does it mean to be a Christian? Many would argue that simply attending weekly liturgy is all that God demands of those professing to be Christian. But what sort of example do we see in the Bible through Jesus? Certainly not one who is just regurgitates a listing of guidelines by which to live. Jesus was a man of action. He befriended, sup­ported, and guided many of the most despised people of his time. Instead of reciting rhetoric to closed ears, Jesus showed how to live as a good person and not just how to act like one. Through his example, we can learn how to better ourselves, how to befriend, support, and guide a group of people who need it most in our time, the elder­ly. 

The subject matter of the class is dif­ficult for the average twenty year old student to look straight in the eye. In the most vibrant, vital years of one's life, it is often difficult to think about-­and sometimes debilitating to deal with--issues of the elderly and dying. As students in an especially active uni­versity, it is thought morbid and depresSing to consider what it's like to be old, to live in a nursing home, or to be facing an impending death. Each student comes into class with his or her own experiences and concerns, making them strong in some areas and weak in others. The starting point for each student is acknowledged and reflection in these areas often times helps the stu­dent to place fears aside and to refocus on the helping aspect of the class. 
In addition to the visits, the class meets to discuss theological issues raised in readings and in the interac­tions with "old people." A wide variety of topics ranging from the grace of God to Jesus as a Servant are discussed not only in the framework of theological readings, but also in terms of what that means for us, as humans. This aspect of the course also raises issues which are as unique as the student who comes to the class. Some doubt the place of God--or even God's existence--in their own lives. Many question their faith when it seems our "ever-loving" God seems to play cruel tricks on us. There are students who question the form of God in which they want to believe. A wide variety of topics is brought to each 
P.O. Box Q 
At another church-related university (Emory) there is a kosher counter in the dining halls to make Jewish students feel welcome, yet nowhere at Notre Dame is kosher food available. Black Muslims now constitute the third larg­est religious group in the American mil­itary forces, yet nowhere is there a suitably oriented prayer room on campus. The religious needs of about 800 Notre Dame students are dis­regarded in the sense of providing chapel or office space for religious leaders. Yet Brandeis University, a predominantly Jewish school, has built a chapel on campus for Catholic stu­dents. And many other church-related universities make such space available to other Christian and Jewish chaplaincies. 
Must we persist in this ghetto-like avoidance of the most important of cul­tural diversities? It is this attitude that makes Notre Dame so oppressive a place for non-Catholics. I hope this at­titude can change within the University as it has within American culture at large.

Dear Editor: 
We wish to thank the many generous students who donated their Air Force game tickets for use by children in the St. Hedwig Outreach Program. The youngsters involved in the program en­joyed their trip out of usual surround­ings into the spirit and fun of cheering the Irish to victory from the student section. We welcome your support and send along a warm "thank you" from the kids themselves.

class meeting allowing for supportive, yet challenging, questions of what it means to be "good Christians." 
Theology and Community Service asks many unsettling questions. The nature of the questions requires that each student reflects within herself and reach for a greater understanding of who God is to her and what that means for her life. The pondering and ques­tioning makes each student vulnerable as she or he exposes weaknesses or fears, but the atmosphere of the small group discussion, provided in class time, allows for sensitive and respect­ful support and guidance. 
It is understood that each person has a unique opinion and insight into the question of God and the elderly, and it is understood that the way we develop as students and as people is to share those feelings without fear of reprisal or of being ostracized. On the contrary, the class nurtures the development of individual nuances in each person's the­ology and respects that difference. Not every question is answered or every fear allievated, but for the student will­ing to take the risk of facing the ques­tions, the outcome can be a positive change to a closer relationship to God andlor oneself. When considering the meaning of this sort of peace, it is no surprise that this class is a special one to the University. Laura Sheffler is a senior psychology major and took Theology and Commu­nity Service last spring.

Dilucia wins singles title at Fallon Invitational 


By BOB MITCHELL 
Sports Writer 
This weekend at Notre Dame's Eck Tennis Pavilion, members of the Irish men's 
tennis team payed tribute to former head coach Tom Fallon the only way they 
knew how-they won. The Irish posted a 15-8 overall record in the Tom Fallon-Notre 
Dame Invitational; 5 of the 15 victories were earned by freshman Dave DiLucia. 
Notre Dame placed participants in both the A singles and doubles final matches 
and DiLucia captured the A singles title. 
A good indicator of a team is what the opposition thinks of you. Wiscons on head coach, Pat Klingelhoets spoke highly of both the Irish squad and the quality of the tournament. 
"It is a very well run and good tournament," said Klingelhoets, coach of the chanmpionship doubles team. "Notre Dame has improved a lot and they are going to do some damage in the future." 
"I mixed it up a lot and tried to serve and volley as much as possible," said DiLucia. ''The support of my teammates and friends helped tremendously.'' ''When I felt like giving up, they gave me strength". 
The other Irish competitors were determined to do their own part. Brian Kalbas lost in the second round to eventual semi-finalist John Noble of Ball State, 6-2, 6-2. Kalbas played for 9 hours on Friday and the "tank was on empty", according to Bayliss. 
Walter Dolhare, in the A draw,fell to finalist Mark Leschly of Harvard, 6-1, 6-3. Dolhare, a junior transfer from Austin Peay, defeated an excellent opponent, Brian Uilhein in the second round, 4-6, 7-6(7-5), 6-0. Odland, the biggest suprise of

the fall season, lost to Scott Hulse in the B draw, 6-7,(2-7), 7-6(7-5), 6-4. 
In the doubles competition, the Irish accumulated a 5-3 record. Notre Dame Junior wing Tim Kuehl and the Notre Dame hockey team rebounded from an 8-3 loss number-one duo of Dave DiLucia-Walter Dolhare advanced to the finals. Yet, they to defeat Rochester Institute of Technology 3-2 In overtime Saturday night at the lost in straight sets, 6-3, 6-2 to Wisconsion's No.2 team of Nelson-Schwartz. Joyce ACC. Steve Megargee details the turnaround beginning on page 12.

on the Kleis goal. 
Notre Dame extended its lead to 2-0 with a power play goal just four minutes later. Matt Hanzel received a pass from Tim Kuehl on the right 
circle and beat RIT goalie Fred Abraham for the second score. 
But RIT came back to tie the game in the first six minutes of the third period on goals by Todd Person and Jim Regan. 
The game stayed that way until a short and frantic over­time. Each team had oppor­tunties to score in the first minute of the 10-minute sudden death overtime period, but only the Irish took advantage. 
RIT had three men in front of Notre Dame goalie Lance Madson, but the Tigers failed to convert. In a matter of seconds, Notre Dame's Bob Herber was flying down the right side with the puck. He passed left to Bruce Guay, who shot past Abraham just 42 seconds into overtime. 
Madson recorded 32 saves for Notre Dame, while RIT's Abra­ham turned back 24 Irish shots. 
"There was much less room to roam on the ice," RIT first­year coach Buddy Powers said. "Our guys were consistently picked up and covered. Last night, we we got a lot of second chances at goals, but tonight they did a better job of clearing out." 

RIT certainly did have plenty of chances to score in Friday's game, which opened the Tigers' season. RIT was par­ticulary adept at cashing in on those opportunities in the second period, when the Tigers scored six times to break open a game Notre Dame had led. 
Notre Dame's Bob Bilton scored the only goal of the first period, on assists by Kevin Patrick and Guay. RIT's Regan scored in the first min­ute of the second period, but Notre Dame regained the lead when Kuehl scored at 8:00 of the period. 
From then on, it was all RIT. The Tigers scored three times in a span of three minutes during the middle of the period, then scored twice more to take a 6-2lead into the third period. 
"We had far too many miscues and far too many giveaways, but I think this un­derlies that we are not a highly skilled team," Schafer said after Friday's game.

The Navy defensive line con­sistently penetrated into the Irish backfield, beating the Irish off the line of scrimmage. The offensive line, a question mark at the beginning of the season, has been hurting lately because of injuries. 
"I think we lost a unity factor today," said guard Tim Grun­hard, who did not play Satur­day. "There's been a shuffling going around. The offense runs on consistency and streaks and we didn't get ourselves on a consistent streak today. I'm glad we got it out of our sys­tem." 
Heading into this season, Holtz expressed concern about the depth and experience of the Irish offensive line. 
The line answered the ques­tion marks in opening season wins over Michigan and Mic­higan State. Grunhard says the offensive line won't be forced into answering the same ques­tions again. 
"I think it's going to be easy to get up (against Rice)," he said. "We have to play our foot­ball to beat them. We're not just going to lay our helmet on the field and beat them."

down reception. The Irish settled for a 29-yard field goal by Ho and a 16-0 halftime lead. 
"Fortunately, our defense was ready to compete and really played well,'' said Holtz, "because every time we tried to get something going on of­fense we had a penalty or some­thing. We didn't have any kind of continuity.'' 
Whatever Holtz told his team at halftime had an immediate effect when the teams took the field for the second half. After receiving the kickoff, the Irish went 67 yards on seven running plays, capped off by Ryan Mihalko's one-yard burst for the score. But Tony Brooks' at­tempt for two points off left tackle fell inches short of the goal line, leaving the score 22-0. 
After four fruitless posses­sions, two for each team, Navy received the ball on the Irish 33 after a 10-yard Jim Sexton punt. Quarterback Alton Griz­zard scampered 22 yards around right end on the fifth play of the drive to put the Middies on the board with three minutes left in the third quar­ter. 

But the wind was finally taken out of Navy's sails early in the fourth quarter on a con­troversial fourth down spot after the Midshipmen had driven the ball down to the Irish 30. 
Fullback Deric Sims stretched for what appeared to be a first down but, after the chains were brought out and the ball's position was scrutinized for over a minute, the officials turned the ball over to Notre Dame on downs. 
"I would say that it was a matter of less than a quarter of an inch," said Irish linebacker Wes Pritchett, who was standing right on top of the spot during the deliberation. 
After that, it was merely a matter of the Irish running out the clock on another win, but it was never easy. 
"We like to think that very team has a breaking point ex­cept us." said Rice, who was 9-of-19 for 95 yards and a touch­down through the air. "And we like to think that when the other team reaches their breaking point, we have it in control. We never reached Navy's break­ing point." 
Holtz was a little more direct in his evaluation. 
"People will say, 'Hey, it's a win'," he said. "But let me tell you something. We've got a lot of serious problems. We're glad to get out with a win, but our kicking game is in trouble, we haven't been able to run be­tween tackle-and-tackle all year, and our backs are doing a lot of dancing around. We're not a very good football team right now."

tallied 13 kills and a team-high 15 digs. 
"I'm really, really pleased," said Irish head coach Art Lam­bert. "This is the best we've played all year. We came back after the first game and just said 'We're not going to lose this thing.' 
"Every win helps you down the road and as the team gets more and more consistent in its play, I think we'll do really well." . 
Saturday night's optimism was a far cry from Friday night's disappointment after the Irish fell to 6th-ranked Ne­braska in three games, 15-12, 15-7 and 15-13. 
The Irish kept the first game close, but the Cornhuskers took the early lead and the Irish could never mount a comeback strong enough to take it away from them. 
A number of service errors and a lack of communication prevented the Irish maintain­ing a consistent attack. 
Notre Dame's offense disin­tegrated in the second game, as the Irish hitters could only manage nine kills for the game. The Irish would fight back only to see the Cornhuskers jump ahead again. 
The Irish, led by Waller's net play, broke out of their two­game trance to gain some mo­mentum in game three, but the jump-serves of Nebraska's Be­cki Bolli broke the Irish and put the Cornhuskers in charge for good. 
"It was not a good night for us," said Lambert. "Nebraska's got a great team and plays great defenses. We played well in spurts and then let them turn it around on us." 
Nebraska's head coach Terry Pettit, who coached Wal­ler on the Olympic B-team last summer, praised the Irish ef­fort. 
"I'm impressed with what Art (Lambert) has done at Notre Dame," said Pettit. "They're a whole level above what they were last year. Notre Dame has a fine team."
