Wilkins Slams Black Study Programs 
NEW YORK (UPI) Roy Wilkins, head of the National 
Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) said 
yesterday the NAACP would go to court to block the creation of 
"autonomous" black studies programs and black student dormitories 
on college campuses.

This is hardly meant as a paean on the Student Union. The Union 
has its faults (The Academic Commission demonstrates a pathetic 
lack of taste and the Social Commission has more than its share of 
problems.), but it also docs its thing and seems to do it pretty well. 
So far Rossie's done his thing, and he's done it well. The problem 
seems to be that the Student Body President doesn't know when 
he's got it good. Right now he's on top of every thing--NO's number

Union President to a board; the SBP chairs the board. The board 
appoin Is and could remove the Student Union president. Meanwhile 
Rcmbusch, Wade, Lanwermeycr, Knappenberger, and Mroz have to 
contend with the details and try to please everybody with goodies 
and not just promises. 

Changing the Student Union President's title and putting him 
under the direct appointment of and subject to direct removal by 
one arbitrary political ngurc ranks as the most foolish move 
witnessed on campus in the last your years. Senators favoring the bill 
have been basing their support on the contention that the bill's passage will enhance the power of the Senate. The Senate's present authority over the Student Union, its budget, its spending, and the appointment of its president, however, will not be enlarged or even affected by the legislation. Only the Student Body President's power will be enhanced.
