MCAT changesdramatically: 'cognitive skills' stressed 
by Dave Rumbacch Staff Reporter 
Major changes in one of the key factors in gaining entry to medical school, the Medical College Ad­mission Test (MCAT), indicate that admissions directors are emphasiz­ing "insight" and "problem sol­ving" more than ever before 
in selecting America's future doc­tors. 
As a result of a five-year. $1 million project initiated by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC). the MCAT has been dramatically changed: in length. from four sections in three hours to six !>t:ctions in six hours; in scoring, from an SAT 200-800 scak to a nev. 1-15 scale; and in emphasis, from "rote memor­ization" to "higher cognitive skills." 
In 1971 tht· AAMC, prompted by complaints from a large p·Jrtion of the medical profession, created a task force of preproffesional ad­visors, admissions officers and practicing physicians to devise a format for a new MCAT. 
Two years later, format com­pleted, the AAMC awarded the contract for research and develop­ment of the test itself to the American Institute for Research (AIR). The test was completed three years later and was first administered last April to 30,000 med school candidates. 
Fr. Joseph Walter, chairman of 
preproffessional studies at Notre 
Dame. served on the task force 
committee representing advisors, a 
group of 12 members from four 
nation-wide regions. 
"The old test was satisfactory for 
the first 20 years but as the number 
of applicants with different back­
grounds increased, dissatisfaction 
grew," Walter stated. "Com­
plaints from admissions officers, 
students, doctors and health o­
fficials led to the AAMC mandate 
to re.,ise the test five years ago," 
he added. 
Tht: main problem with the old 
test, said Walter, was that it 
tended to produce doctors who 
were "safe" but not necessarily "good." "A safe doctor is one who never makes really big mistakes but lacks the insight, ... the ability to put textual knowledge and diagnostic ability together which makes a good physician," Walter stated. 
Problem solving stressed 
An important change in the new MCAT favors students with the ability to apply knowledge to problem solving. The science problems section of the new test is a case in point. 
"Instead of bringing in advanced content, we introduced difficulty by requiring the student to apply ideas he learned in science," William Shanner, AIR technical advisor, stated recently in Human Behavior. 
According to the AAMC, course­work considered prerequisite for the new MCAT is limited to first year courses in biology, inorganic chemistry. physics, and organic chemistry. 
Harrison Gough, a psychologist at the Institute for Personality Assesment, University of Calif­ornia. commented in a recent issue of Human Behavior. "As a side effect. the old MCAT shaped 20 years of American medicine by selecting students . of a particular temperament.'' According to Gough the old MCAT eliminated many "doers and good workers" in favor of "brainy intellectual types" whose academic orientation led them into research and other specialized areas. 
The last quarter century has seen a dramatic drop in the number of new doctors entering family med­icine, a field which culled 85 to 95 percent of new physicians as recently as 1950. In 1970 less than 10 percent of the graduating doc­tors entered family medicine, a decrease which in no small way reflects the influence of the old MCAT, said Gough. 
Test restructured 
The new MCAT consists of six sections, 363 questions, and lasts six hours. 
Ntaddox suffers attack; c~ondition termed critical 
ATLANTA [AP] -Lester Maddox, the former Georgia governor who gained national attention as a segregationist restaurant owner, was listed in critical condition last night after suffering a heart attack, hospital officials said. 
Maddox suffered chest pains about 9 p.m. and was brought by ambulance to ·a Smyrna, GA. hospital north of Atlanta, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
Moddox's doctor was with him in the hospital's intensive care unit, she ~;aid. 
Maddox, 61, preceded President Carter as Georgia governor in the late 1960's. He also served as Cart·~r·s lieutenant governor from 1971 to 1974, and the two often feuded publicly. 
Maddox ran unsuccessfully for anotlter term as governor in 1974 and was the American Interna­tional party's presidential candi­date in 1976. 
Si:11ce then he has returned to the 
estaurant business, and he also has embarked recently on a night­club career in a two-man act with a young black man. ·· 
Maddox became a national figure in the early 1960's when he closed his Picknick Restaurant rather than let blacks eat there. At the time some of his supporters armed themselves with pick handles to help keep blacks out, and the pick handles became a Maddox trademark. 
He ran unsuccessfully for nume­rous local and statewide offices before becoming governor in 1967. 
Republican Howard "Bo" Calla­way, later defense secretary and President Ford's campaign mana­ger, got the most votes in the 1966 gubernatorial election, but neither he nor Maddox won a majority. That threw the election into the heavily Democratic Georgia Legis­lature, which chose Maddox. 
Maddox has usually called him­self a Democrat, although many consider him a political conserva­tive. 
The first three sections comprise the "scientific knowledge" portion of the test and include consecutive tests in biology, chemistry, and physics. Unlike the old test these three sections are scored sep­arately; this change allows college officials to guage an applicant's strengths and weaknesses. 100 minutes is allowed for completion of the first three sections. 
The fourth section is a group of "applications" or science problems which combine skills from the three disciplines of biology, chemistry, and physics. The emphasis in this section is on "thinking" and "insight" rather than rote memor­ization. The scientific problems section has a 70 minute limit and concludes the morning session. 
The afternoon session consists of two tests designed to measure verbal skills. They are the skills analysis, reading test and the skills analysis quantitative test. The reading test presents passages from various technical sources such as psychology, economics, soc­iology or medicine and then asks comprehensive questions about the material. 
The quantitative test consists of technical passages which include scientific data. This test requires the student to interpret graphs and other data and make decisions based on those interpretations. Both skills analysis tests contain 73 questions and allow 90 minutes. 
The revtston of the verbal analysis part of the MCAT created controversy among the various factions of the AAMC task force. ''Some people thought that some sort of measurement of 'human­ities' skills should be included," Walter revealed. "No one, how­ever, liked the old vocabulary test." 
The old MCAT's verbal analysis section consisted of a vocabulary [continued on page 2]

Social space proposal developing 
by Peggy McGuire Special Projects Co-Chairman Wally Saad and Jim Seifert will propose the creation of new areas for social functions or at least the equalization of present social space at the Oct. 21 meeting of the Board of Trustees. Anne Thompson, Chariman of the committee on co-education, is also helping to formulate the proposal. ''Right 111ow, the social space on campus is not equally distributed,'' Seifert said. "Each person in Howard has approximately 1.7 sq. ft. of social space compared to 100 sq. ft. per Holy Cross resident. Everyone pays the same amount for room and board. It's not fair that somoe have less space to socialize just because of their location.' "One suggestion may be to move people out of Howard and convert their rooms into social areas," continued Seifert. "It all depends on how much money we can get." The committee will also propose the creation of new areas. "We need torenovateLaFortune or build more places like the Bulla Shed or the St. Mary's Clubhouse," Saad stated. Saad also cited drawbacks of the current student center. "Students just aren't using LaFortune to socialize," he stated. "At 9 o'clock on any week-night, there are more 
people visiting on the second floor of the library than in LaFortune. In fact, some of my friends have found it easier to study in LaFortune than the library." 
Saad and Seifert began collecting data for the proposal last spring after examining the situation in each dormitory. Thompson was added to the committee because of the effect of social space on co-education. 
Seifert said, "Co-education makes social space even more necessary. People need a place where they can go without worry­ing about parietals." 
Saad, Seifert, and Thompson will present their proposal to Student Government for approval before submitting it to the Board of Trustees. Their presentation will include slides taken from parties in several dormitories last weekend and photographs which emphasize the vast discrepancy in social space distribution. 
Saad and Seifert feel that the slides will stress the explicit need for more space. Saad said that the slides taken at the parties "will show that people are busting out of the social space that there is." 
Seifert is confident that tge board will respon!l positively to the proposal. "Ifour side is presented well, they can't be anything but in favor of it," he said. "I think the board really wants to help improve the social situation on campus, but they aren't here so they really don't understand what the . problems are." 
Saad and Seifert cited Zahm's social room as an ideal.'situation. 
"Zahm has a car­peted room with new furniture and a bar," Saad said. "The residents make all the rules and abide by them too. But it was all done by the students with no help from the university.'' 
Peggy Foran, a resident assis­tant in Lyons, commented, "The situation in Lyons really stinks. For over 240 residents, there is only a small study lounge and a kitchen which substitues for a 24-hour lounge. There is a definite need for more social space." 
One Farley Hall resident said, "While the situation in Farley isn't as bad as in some dorms, I can see a real need for more social space. A lot of the students here are stuck on campus without cars. They're willing to compensate by having their own parties instead of going to the bars, but there just isn't any place to go." 
"I don't think anyone likes those parties where everyone is crammed into a small room like a bunch of 
, sardines. It really would be nice if we had some place where we could have a decent party," she added ...

MCA T changes scoring because of complaints 
[condnued from page 1) test and a general knowledge test, both of which had been drawing tire from areas of the medical profession for some time. The general knowledge test, which Walter likened to a TV trivia game show. had been especially crit­icized for its cultural discrimina­tion. The need for a non-scientific ''personality evaluation," how­ever, is well-acknowledged. "Ev­eryone agrees that the traits not tapped by cognitive tests are important--perhaps more critical than the candidate's knowledge of medicine," James Erdmann direct­or of the AAMC's research division stated in Human Behavior. The AAMC is currently develop­ing a non-cognitive evaluation which, according to Walter, will be designed to evaluate such charac­ter traits as social awareness, motivation, personality and fitness to enter the medical profession. The test is still in the planning and results may be years away Walter stated. 
Groups formed to discuss Rosary, Bible 
by Anne Bachle 
The Saint Mary's College Spiri­tual Commission will sponsor Rosary and Bible discussion groups this semester in order "to get students involved again in some of the Catholic traditions," stated Jeanie Ritter, spiritual commis­sioner. 
"I think students have fallen away from things like saying the Rosary and reading the Bible,'' explained Ritter. 
Wednesday night at 7 p.m. in Stapleton Lounge, the commission will sponsor tow speakers who will discuss the value of the Rosary. Ritter will lead discussions of Bible readings in the Holy Cross Lounge beginning at 9 p.m. on Thursday evening and alternate Thursdays thereafter. 
"I really think these can be helpful for any students who are interested in renewing some of the aspects of their Catholic faith,' commented Ritter. "I encourage anyone and everyone to attend."

Scoring altered 
In response to complaints form 
medical school admissions officers, 
the new MCA T will be scored on a 
l-15 point scale rather than the 
200-800 SAT-like scale formerly 
used. The old scale was mislead­
ing, Walter stated, in that the 
difference between a score of 600 
and a score of 575 may appear 
significant but in fact, indicates 
only a difference of one correct 
answer. "Admission officers will 
know precisely what each score 
represents," Walter asserted. 
Students will have more time to 
complete the new test. The 
previous MCAT allowed three 
hours to answer 221 questions 
while the new test provides six 
hours for 363 questions. 
Approximately 180 Notre Dame 
students took the new MCAT when 
it was administered for the first 
time last April and 200 more will 
take it when it is given again Oct. 1, 
according to Dr. Daniel Burr, Notre 
Dame preprofessional advisor. 
Notre Dame senior Jim O'Neill, who took the test in April, stated, "The test was quite difficult, exhaustive. It tested not only knowledge but the ability to cope.'' 
Other ND seniors who took the test as underclassmen found it challenging. Maryanne Pizza stated, "It was exhaustive but I had enough time. Everything, even the readings, related to medicine." 
Senior Debbie Darnley feels that, despite AAMC claims to the contrary, the test required more than just the knowledge taught in introductory courses. "It was hard and too long. You definitely needed more than introductory courses," she stated. 
All applications for acceptance to next year's entering med school class must include results of the new MCAT.

'Exj~raordinary Ministers' program to iJnclude formation sessions 
by 'Valerie Stefani 
The formation of the Extraordi­nary Ministers of the Eucharist program came about because of a pastoral need according to Sr. Jane Pitz, assistant director of Campus Ministry. Introduced at Notre Dame four years ago, the program ritualizes the sense of people giving themselves to others by enabling parish members to admi­nister the Eucharist. 
Campus Ministry has revised the program this year with the help of John Melloh of the Center for Pastoral Liturgy, an organization which researches and formulates various liturgical programs throughout lthe United States. 
The two-fold program consists of two and one-half hour formation sessions during which personal and shared reflection is encouraged and a commissioning of ministers

ln!;urance won't cover Morrissey fire damage 
by Kevin M. Walsh St,nlor Staff Reporter 
Damages estimated as high as $40,000 from the recent Morrissey Hall fire will not be covered by the University's insurance policy, according to Bro. Kieran Ryan, asst. vice president for Business Affairs. 
The fire, which forced 250 Mor­rissey residents to evacuate in the early morning hours of Sept. 10, gutted one room and caused smoke and water damage in several others. 
Charles S. Reddy, University insurance officer, confirmed the fact that the school's insurance policy will not cover the damage. "The University property insur­ance covers all buildings on cam­pus and their contents, but is subject to a deductable amount. Since the damages are within the deductable amount the University must assume all of the losses," said Reddy. 
He declined to state the amount of the--'University's deductable rate is sure to increase in the next level, but did say "it is greatly in renewal period." excess of the $40,000 anticipated The University cannot be held loss." responsible for the personal items

Power failure knocks out laundry service 
by Laura Larimore 
Recent delays in the laundry 
service are~ a reslut of a massive 
pow{:r failure last Wednesday, 
according to Adolph Keglovits, 
director. Repairs were not com­
pleted until late Wednesday night. 
The problem stemmed from the 
difficulty of procuring the now 
obsdetc parts to fix the equipment. 
to prevent such an accident in the 
future, the laundry has purchased a 
second unit, facilitating a switch­
over if the main unit fails. 
The laundry is presently two 
days. behind schedule and is work­
ing overtime and on Saturdays in a 
effo11 to catch up. Keglovits said 
students should be patient. Service 
should return to normal in the near 
future. He added that there has chairman of the Student Relations Boarc!.. 
Smits noted that certain acade­mic, social, personal, and due process rights belong to the stu­dents, as indicated in the Student Handbook and the Student Proce­dural Manual. In order to help familiarize students with their rights and responsibilities, a forum, open to the entire campus, will be held sometime near October break. 
"Rather than restricting a stu­dent to campus for breaking parie­tals, we miglltt send her to a value clarifications clinic. This forces the student to reconsider the conse­quences of her act and puts her back into the community,'' stated Smits. 
"There should also be more consistency in the judicial system," stressed Smits. "Everyone com­mitting the same offense should be treated . " Smits plans to

acomplish that objective by inform­ing hall directors which offenses require appearance before the hall judicial board and which can be settled individually. 
Smits also said that she would be re-evaluating the judicial system and investigating any flaws. "The only serious flaw that exists now is the fact that the aggrieved party can't appeal its case," observed Smits. She also plans to amend any inconsistencies in the student man­ual. 
This year anyone involved in the judicial system will go through a four hour training process consist­ing of a series of workshops. The workshops cover the subjects of decision making, values clarifica­tion, moral decision making, and technicalities of the judicial system. "By taking part in workshops, members of the judicial system will fully understand their purpose when they send a student to them," stated Smits. 
Smits noted that relatively few cases have been sent before the various ju~icial boards. "That is · 
good indication that the students are mature and live up to their responsibilities," she added.

Although the room in Morrissey did contain a plywood partition to separate the sleeping and social areas, Dean of Students James Roemer said that no disciplinary action or suit will be brought against the room's residents. 
"If a person's carelessness or negligence could be clearly shown as the cause of property loss, then that person should be responsible for his actions,' noted Roemer. 
But, he said, since the fire seems to have been caused by an electri­cal fire in a wall socket, the students will not be held respon­sible. 
Although the University's policy does not cover personal losses, Reddy states that most students should have no problem in getting insured under their parent's poli­cies. 
In most home policies, the coverage for any personal loss, such as those in the Morrissey fire, is usually ten percent of the parent's household insurance policy. Reddy said, "All a student must do is make a complete, descriptive list of the losses and send it to his or her parent's insurance officer to get a refund."~

Pay Up or Stay Home 
It is always unfortunate when the actions of a few irresponsible people ruin oppor­tunities for the majority. 
However, the current controversy over the ND-SMC shuttle bus was caused by a very sizable minority. So many students last year "forgot" to pay the 15-cent fare that the shuttle operated at a $21,000 loss. 
No company is in business to lose money, including the South Bend Public Transportation Corporation (Transpo). So, in order to recover their losses, they felt it necessary to raise St. Mary's and Notre Dame's fees 24 percent. 
Although the two institutions jointly pay approximately $50,000 a year for the bus to run during class hours, extra service in the evenings and on weekends adds another $25,000 to $40,000 to the bill. This amount should be collected in student fares. Neither St. Mary's nor Notre Dame feels it is their responsibility to foot the bill for transportation after class hours. They provide the service, but the students must care enough to support it. 
A 90-day trial pe1iod is now in effect until Nov. 26, at which time a solution must be reached. H bus riders continue to pay the correct fare, as most have been doing this year, the shuttle will be continued. 
On the other hand, if the "irresponsi­bles" are allowed to slip back into their former bad habits, this bus which is so vital to ND-SMC relations will see its last nights and weekends on campus. Students will be forced to walk the long, dark road bet ween campuses, increasing the risk of rapes and attacks. During the winter, snow drifts and sub-zero temperatures will keep the two schools separate, damaging their long history of friendship. 
So, pay your 15 cents when you climb on the bus. Don't let the shuttle drive off when the sun sets ea·ch Friday afternoon, not to return until Monday morning! 
~~P.O. Box Q~~ 
Shuttle 

warn1ng 
Dear Editor: 
I was disturbed by the implica­
tions of the recent Observer article, "One raped, two accosted" (Sept. 7). The reported attacks made me think twice about walking alone at night, expecially along the road between Notre Dame and St. Mary's. Dean Roemer has warned women to "get transportation by bus or car between the two colleges.'' This is sound advice, but is may be difficult to carry out. Many students don't have access to a car, and the evening Shuttly is operating on a 90-day probation because too many of its riders· aren't paying the IS-cent fare. , What happens if the bus stops 
running? 
We could probably find alterna­
tives for the Shuttle. The colleges 
could have an illuminated under­
ground tunnel dug from the Memo­
rial Library to Holy Cross Circle. 
However, this project would be 
expensive, and construction would 
take time and leave students 
stranded on either side of Route 31 
until its completion. The adminis­
tration could order a barbed-wire 
fence to shield campus women 
from would-be rapists, but the 
structure would spoil the aesthetic 
beauty of the area. Students who 
found the intercollege hike un­
avoidable could run personals such 
as: "Urgently need two 
companions to walk from Lewis to 
Madaleva, MWF 8 pm. References 
required. Will share services of my 
German shepherd." 
Obviously, the Shuttle is a more 
feasible way of travelling than the 
previous suggestions. However, its 
services will continue only if riders 
assume a little responsibility and 
pay their fares. Wise up, ND-SMCI 
Fifteen cents is hardly a high price 
for safety.

A case of murder 
Dear Editor: 
Several days ago, I was slowly walking between the grotto and the lake in the early evening, shortly after sundown. 1 heard some of the ducks squaking rather loudly, and witnessed several young men stoning a duck. I tried to break it up, but too late. The duck was dead. You might say, who the hell cares about a duck? I do. I think it illustrates the immaturity of any Notre Dame student who would think so little of the Iit'e of such a beautiful and defenseless animal as a duck, especially when our little 
feathered friends give so much pleaS1Ire to students and visitors alike as they glide about the lakes . 
As I looked at the dead duck, I wanted to cry for ugly human beings who have no regard for life at all. If I was in a position of authority at this University, I would have immediately expelled such students from this community. I know that there are bigger issues of justice, and love for our fellow human beings to be concerned with, but let's start with the little things ... if we're faithful in those, then maybe ... 
Rev. Len Kuberski,,.,. 
St. Ted questioned 
Dear Editor: I am writing this public letter of thanks fot the remarkable lesson in justice with which we all have been graced. I must confess that were it not for the occasionally consistent words and deeds of our own Father Hesburgh I might still be in a quandary as to what is justice. However, thanks to Saint Ted, this question is no longer an important one. He has made it clear that might makes right and that justice Is expediency. Praise be to Hesburehl In addition to making me realize what justice is, Saint Ted has now made it imperative that I drop one of my philosophy courses. In John Rawls' A Theory of Justice, used by me "Seminar on Justice" class, Rawls contends that for a society to be formally just it must apply its principles impartially and consis­tently to all its members. In the opinion of Rawls, "The inevitable vagueness of laws in general and the wide scope allowed for their interpretation encourages an arbi­trariness in reaching decisions which only an allegiance to justice can allay.... The desire to follow rules impartially and consistently, to treat similar cases similarly, and to accept the consequences of the application of public norms is intimately connected with the desire, or at least the willingness, to recognize the rights and liberties of others and to share fairly in the benefits and burdens of social cooperation. The one desire tends to be associated with the other." How could Rawls make such an egregious error? This interpreta­tion of justice is so inconsistent with the recent actions of St. Ted in the AI Hunter case that it would surely leave him grim and white­faced. 
If one were to accept Rawls' theory of justice he would perforce conclude that either Notre Dame is not a Christian institution, for an instit~tioa that is Christian is at least JUSt, or else that impartiality. 
and consistency have nothing to do with justice. Since Saint Ted does believe Notre Dame to be a Christian institution, then it must be that he does not believe in justice as fairness. Who could argue with a saint? 
Thomas Merrigan 
Food waste 
Dear Editor: It is obvious that the intent of my letter entitled "Food Waste All Year Long" completely escaped Maureen McShan. In careless fashion, Miss McShan seemed to accuse me of condoning food wars! This I must entirely deny. My point was that daily food waste shoulu be brought to the attention of students with a similar fervor and intensity to that of bi-annual :food fights. It should be obvious that no form of punishment can control the vehemence and subsequent waste of a rowdy few. However, an ounce of daily care can save tons of daily waste.

The Unspoiled Truth 
patrick e. mangan 
I am writing this article in response to the case that David Cwik, in his article, "The Failure of Notre Dame," brought against the teaching principles of this univer­sity, and in response to his opposi­tion which was expressed in Paul 
Barrickmaum's  article,  "Catholic  
Faith  Dusty"  and  in  Louis  P.  
Pojman's  article  "Cwik  

Confused.'' 
Quite frankly, it is my optmon that not enough credit has been given to Mr. Cwik. I am afraid that the followi111g statement would also receive tht: same opposition. "As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus, the Lord, so walk ye in Him: rooted and built up in Him and established in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ." Yet this is the word of God revealed by the Holy Spirit to the apostle Paul, r.nd it is quite clear that Paul, acting on this truth, appropriated a great amount of power in his life through his steadfast trust in God. 
Paul's life did not lack direction and purpose. I can't help but see the similarities between Cwik's priJlcipal objections to the manner 
. of teaching here at Notre Dame, 
and Paul's warning to all Chris­tians. It is also interesting to note that Paul was perhaps the most learned apostle and studied under the highly admired teacher Gamaliel. Yet Paul never gave any credit to this teacher or to any of his teachings for the joy, peace, and direction in Paul's life. Paul accredited any success he attained to the simple truth of Christ. The most important thing in the world for Paul was to know Christ. The knowledge he had gained from Gamaliel was barren and dry without Christ. But in Christ he was made alive; he was fulfilled. Saul of Tarsus, the legalistic, hateful persecutor, became Paul the apostle ofi<We. His understand­ing of the truth was illuminated by an inner awakening through Christ. Once, he had looked with contempt 
upon ordinary people, but he became a loving and outgoing individual. He found a new kind of understanding through faith which meant sharing in the power and truth and love of Jesus. 
Paul, in writing to the Corinthi­ans, also saw fit to warn them concerning the wisdom of men. He, through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit wrote: "For it is written 'I (God) will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.' 

Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world. For after that in the wisdom of God the world by knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe...But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise..." (I Cor. 1:19-21, 27). For these reasons, I must agree with David Cwik that we cannot teach the philosophies of self-inflated men as truth, nor can we examine them within a "neutral framework." Jesus said that the Father would send the Holy Spirit to teach us all things (John 14:26), and that the Holy Spirit will guide us into all truth (John 16:13). 
Therefore, I am a part of the 
minority that must support Mr. 
Cwik's claims, but more important­
ly, I am a part of the minority that 
supports the Bible, which is the 
living Word of God. 
In any case, if we meet by way of this article or in any other way and you forget me, you have lost nothing. But if you meet Jesus Christ and forget Him, you have lost everything. For Jesus said, "I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life: no man cometh unto the . Father but by Me" [John 14:6].

Catlen~ar Office to handle all event scheduling 
by Jack Pizzolato 
S4mfor Staff Reporter 
A plan to channel the scheduling of all student events through the Student Union (SU) Calendar Office will go into effect immedi­ately, according to SU Calendar Office Director Mary Ann Moore. 
The proposal, which will coordi­nate the efforts of the Student Union with the University's official calendar office located in the Center for Continuing Education (CCE), was discussed and agreed to Friday by representatives of the two groups. 
_Present at the meeting were Moore, Gertrude Kessel, calendar coordinator for the CCE, Bro. John Benesh, director of Student Activi­ties, John Reid, assistant director of Student Activities and SU Direc­tor Tom Gryp. 
''The meeting was held to clarify each office's duties," Moore said, "and to establish a precedence regarding student events." 
At present, the CCE Calendar Office schedules all university events. Student organizations and hall representatives who want to reserve an area for their activities must first receive approval from one of several individuals in charge of buildings on campus. 
The SU Calendar Office was set-up last semester to handle the growing number of scheduling conflicts between dorm, club, class and SU events. Problems arose, however, according to Student Union sources, when clubs and organizations simply by-passed or were unable to contact Moore, making the SU Calendar Office 
Sufrldes heads 'Campaign for Nl)' as new director of development 
Thomas J ..Suddes has been promoted to director of develop­ment by Dr. James W. Frick, vice president for public relations and development. Suddes, who has been on the University's develop­ment stafF since 1973, will assume the positi)n immediately. 
"Suddes will direct 'The Cam­paign for Notre Dame,' the major fund-rai!;ing program we announced last April," Frick said. "In addition, he will have respon­sibility for the University's other development programs, including the Annual Fund, and will super­vise the activities of our regional development offices in New York City, Chicago and Los Angeles." 
"I am confident he will bring to the overall management of the campaign the same leadership and competence that he has exhibitied since joining Notre Dame's development staff," Frick added. 
A native of Peoria, IL, Suddes graduated from Notre Dame in 1971 with a degree in communica­tion arts. He was active in hall government and was a participant in and organizer of the University's Bengal Bouts program, an associa­tion he has continued since his return to campus. 
After serving two years as an infantry officer in the Army at Fort Benning, GA, he joined the Uni­
. versity's Public Relations and De­velopment Division as a regional director of development with responsibility for fund-raising efforts among alumni, parents, friends, corporations and founda­tions in a four-state area composed of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana. More recently, Suddes has had a major planning role in nationwide efforts to raise $130 million, the goal of the current "Campaign for Notre Dame," which is intended to increase dramatically the Univer­sity's present $108 million endow­ment. The campaign, the largest in Notre Dame's history and the 12th largest now underway in American higher education, has received 
29,735 commitments totaling $70,150,832 in six months. 
Since establishing a formal fund­raising operation in 1947, the University has raised more than $200 million, not including gifts to its current campaign. 
Prof. Dull attends PIRIT conference 
Martin Dull, associate professor of mathematics at Saint Mary's College, attended a meeting of the Project on Institutional Renewal Through the~ Improvement of Teaching (PIIRIT) last Thursday and Friday in Washington, D.C. 
Saint Mary's College is one of eight midwestern institutions invi­ted to participate in PIRIT, which is sponsored by the Society for Values in Higher Education. The goal of· PIRIT is to improve the quality of teaching and learning throught the revision of institutional policies and procedures. 
ineffective. 
As Moore outlined the new procedure, all student activities would be scheduled through the SU Calendar Office. "My office will get in touch with the different people involved to reserve an area, then we'll get back to the student and confirm the activity with the CCE," she said. Student groups who go the CCE Calendar Office first will be referred to Moore. 
Moore emphasized that the role of the SU Calendar Office is to perform ''a service to student groups on campus." "We're not a regulatory group,' she remarked, adding, "I won't say 'no' (to a group) on any date, but I will advise them on when to have their activity." 
The SU Calendar Office is now in. 
the process of expanding its staff and office hours to facilitate the scheduling of student activities. Marnie Brehmer is presently in charge of clubs and other events. ''I would like to get someone in charge of athletics,'' Moore com­mented. 
In addition, the SU Calendar Office is planning to produce a monthly calendar publication to appear by November, as well as establishing a "liaison" with the St. Mary's campus. "We also will be working through the social commissions in each hall,'' Moore noted. . 
"If we can put this into practice and have it working well,'' Moore concluded, referring to the new plan, "it will be a ,major accom­plishment for the calendar office."

--Irish score 17 fourth quarter points 
ND turns back Boilernnakers 
by Paul Stevenson Sports Editor 
West Lafayette, Ind. -Deja vue is the best way to describe Notre Dame's come from behind victory over the Boilermakers this past Saturday. The Irish were trailing 24-14 entering the fourth quarter, when Joe Montana performed his first encore since the 1975 gridiron season, leading Notre Dame to 17 fourth period points and a 31-24 triumph. 
Yes. the Monongahela Minute­man, in a style reminiscent of the 1975 contests with Air Force and North Carolina, directed the Irish offensive attack and destroyed any chances Purdue had for an upset-win. 
The first score came with 4:34 elapsed in the contest, when Scott Sovereen connected on a 25 yard field goal. The tally was set up by a Notre Dame fumble on the Irish 32 yard line. 
The Fighting Irish were unable to move the ball and on their next possession, Purdue marched 61 yards in nine plays to reach paydirt. The touchdown came on a first down and goal at the Notre Dame eight. On the play, fresh­man phenom. Mark Herrmann, found wide receiver Reggie Arnold open for the score. 
The Irish trailed 10-0 after Sovereen added the extra point. Then, the coaches replaced num­her-one signal caller, Rusty Lisch, with Gary Forystek. In Forystek's first series of downs, the Irish travelled 30 yards downfield before stalling. 
After holding the Boilermakers, on their next series of downs, the Irish began what was to be their first scoring drive at the Purdue 42 yard line. On the third play of the series, Forystek dropped back to pass. But, with receivers well covered and pressure from the Purdue defensive line, Forystek left the pocket and found some

14_ against North Carolina in the fourth quarter to a 21-14 triumph. But a shoulder injury suffered last fall prevented Montana from Jogging any time during the 1976 campaign. However, many believed the Irish signal caller would bounce back to lead Notre Dame in 1977. However, because of his injury, Montana fell behind Rusty Lisch and Gary Forystek oh the depth chart. Both of the quarterbacks in front of him were very capable and for Montana to advance, he would have to turn in a superb perfor­mance when the opportunity arose. The Irish fell behind early against the Boilermakers, 10-0. Dan Devine wasted no time in trying to find a man that could direct his wing-T offense. Gary Forystek was called upon, and 
running room up the middle. 
However, after gaining five yards, the Irish signal caller was hit by three Boilermaker defenders and was thrown to the turf. An ambulance brought the injured quarterback to a neighboring hos-pita! and it was later discovered that Forystek had suffered a broken clavicle and a concussion. 
Lisch assumed the controls once 
again and guided the offense the 
remaining 27 yards for the score. 
The touchdown came on a six yard 
toss from Lisch to tri-captain Terry 
Eurick. Dave Reeve's conversion 
narrowed Purdue's lead to 10-7. 
On the Boilermaker's next pos­session, Herrmann was intercepted by Doug Becker at the Purdue 32 yard line. The Irish linebacker returned the ball all the way to the endzone, but a clipping infraction on the three yard line, returned the ball to the Purdue 18. 
On third down and ten at the 18, Lisch threw a playbook pass to Eurick for the Notre Dame touch­down. Reeve connected on the point after and gave the Irish their first lead, 14-10. 
Purdue would not be out-done as Herrmann guided his troups down-field for another tally. Starting at their own 34, the Boilermakers began· a scoring march. Five plays and 66 yards later, Purdue led, 17-14. The score came on a 37 yard aerial strike from Herrmann to Raymond Smith. 
Then, after holding Notre Dame, the Boilermakers tallied on their next opportunity. Starting from their own 12 yard line, Purdue marched the remaining 88 yards in seven plays. The major plays in the drive were a 48 yard pass from Herrmann to Arnold and a 43 yard touchdown strike to Orlando Pope. With the conversion by Sovereen, Purdue increased their lead, 24-14. 
In the first half, Purdue had compiled 14 first downs, 32 yards rushing and 254 yards in the air. Meanwhile, the Irish had notched 
although the senior quarteroacK generated movement in the offense, after only nine plays at the controls, Forystek was injured. 
Lisch returned to the lineup and led the Irish to two second quarter scores, but in the third period, when the Irish were still down by ten points, Notre Dame needed a change, a change which could lift the Irish off the ground and enable them to stage a comeback. 
With 1:40 left in the third period, Montana was inserted in the quar­terback slot. The change seemed to have such an emotional effect on the team as a whole. The offense executed with more determination and confidence. They played as though they knew they could score.

. A qua~erback is not soley statis­ttcs. A_ stgnal caller must generate enthus1asm throughout the team as a whole. He must be a lead~r. If the quarterback does not dtspl~y 
confidence, . then the te~m wt.ll not reflect thts confidence tn thetr performance. 
There have been so many rumors circulating about the campus since the season began. The coaches and team have felt the pain of defeat once this year. Hopefully,they've realized their mistakes. At least in Saturday's game, an attempt was made to add variety and diversity to the play selection. 
Montana displayed a great amount of poise, even though he had been in similar situations, it had been two years. When Dave · Mitchell scored the final Irish . touchdown, it was proof to those 48 yards on the ground and 120 more via the aerial attack. 
The entire third period was scoreless, but the strategic change which altered the complexion of the contest, occurred with only 1 :40 left in the quarter. Montana entered the lineup for the first time in two years. On his first play, the Irish signal caller handed off to David Mitchell, who rambled for eight yards but fumbled when tackled. 
Purdue: now had the football on the Notn: Dame 30 with an excel­lent opportunity to increase their leading margin. A few plays later, when fac~d with a fourth down and goal at the nine, Sovereen entered the game to attempt a 27 field goal for Purdue. Although the three­point try was good, the Boiler­makers were called for illegal procedur~. On his next attempt, Sovereen was wide left with his boot and the score remained, 24-14. The Irish then had possession at their own 20 yard line with Mon­tana leading the offense only seconds into the fourth quarter. Hitting Ken MacAfee for a 26 yard strike and Kris Haines for compte­tions of 19 and 25 yards, the Irish then had a first and goal at the Purdue t·en yard line. Unable to advance the ball for the touchdown, Reeve booted his only field goal of the game and narrowed the Purdue lead to 24-17. 
Several plays later, with a first down at the Notre Dame 40, Herrmann was intercepted by Luther Bradley. It appeared as though Bradley would duplicate his feat oftwo years ago and return/the ball all tlhe way for a touchdown, however, the senior cornerback was tripped up by Herrmann. 
The Irish offense now had a first down at the Purdue 35. Montana took two passing plays to lead the team for the touchdown. Both passes wc!nt to MacAfee. First a 22 yard strike and then a 13 yard toss over the middle for the tally with 
that believed tqe team could bounce back. ·· 
Scoring 17 points in the final period when the chips were down was truly the sign of a champion­ship football team. It makes one feel optimistic about the remainder of the season. The team has revealed the potential that many" believed they possessed. Now, they must do it consistently and for the remainder of the year if they wish to reclaim their preseason status. 
The Notre Dame-Purdue game was one of the most exciting the Irish have played in a couple of years. It's hard to recall the last time 93 passes have been thrown in one game·. 
H d c h D · 

ea ' oac Dan evme was unbelievably effervescent iri the post-game Irish locker room. 
"This was a tremendous win by the players," Devine stressed. "They
11 h · h h 

rea y ung m t ere. T is was one the great~st exhibitions of courage I've ever seen in a team." 
There may be numerous opinions and beliefs about the coaches and team, however, this Saturday, the Irish proved they deserve their second chance. With the entire coaching staff working together with the team, a great deal can be accomplis.hed in the remaining football weekends. 
No matter what the cause of disagreement or problems, if the squad truly wants to finish at the top, they must continue to play the way they revealed they were capable of Saturday. The students cannot just sit back and make comments. The support of the student body, through any situa­tions whkh may develop, can help guide this team to the comeback they've illlitiated.

.... 
Quarterback joe Montana completed nine out of 14 passes for 154 yards to lead the Irish to 17 fourth quarter points. 
10:22 left in the game. With Reeve's extra point, the Irish had tied the contest at 24. 
Minutes later, with only 4:121eft ,n the battle, the Irish began their final scoring drive of the afternoon. 
The march covered 68 yards in six plays. Raine's 26 yard reception and a IS yard toss from Montana to MacAfee highlighted the drive. The tally came on a five yard burst by Mitchell off left guard. When Reeve added the conversion, the Irish led 31-24. 
Herrmann attempted to lead the Boilermakers to a last second comeback, but after four straight
incomplete passes, the Irish re­gained possession and ran out the clock. 

The contest was one of the most thrilling ever played by the Devine­coached Fighting Irish. There were 93 passes in the contest, 51 by Purdue and 42 by Notre Dame. The Irish amassed 424 yards total offense, 315 in the air. The Boilermakers chalked up 403 total offense, 351 through the sky. In one quarter of play, Montana com­pleted nine of 14 for 154 yards and one touchdown. Haines had five catches for 120 yards while MacAfee added nine receptions for 114 yards. 
Herrmann went 24 of 51 for 351 yards and three touchdowns, while being intercepted three times. Herrmann also carried the ball five times. These 56 rushing and passing plays sets a new mark for a Notre Dame opponent for the total offense record. The previous record was set by Roger Staubach of Navy, who had 55 rushing and passing plays in 1964. 
The Purdue signal caller needs only 28 more yards passing to 1000 yards in the air for the season. Herrmann has also thrown 73 completions, on less than the entire 1976 season output. 
Purdue now prepares for Wake Forest next Saturday in Ross-Ade Stadium, while the Irish will enter­tain Michigan State in their home opener. 

Dave O'Keefe The Road Ahead 
Instant Replay 

The Purdue game is history and the Irish may be back on the road to the National Championship that many felt would be theirs before the season started. Joe Montanawill in all likelihood takeover the offense on the merits of his eleventh-hour heroics in West Lafayette. And Dan Devine will keep his job. 
It seems like ages ago, but less than three years have passed since the Sunday night in December when Ara Parseghian decided that he had had enough. I remember listening to WSND's "Speaking of Sports" show that night as dozens of callers offered candidtates for the head coaching job. They ranged from Don Shula to Dean Hofman, but throughout the show there was one unanimous sentiment emphatically expressed: "Anyone but Devine." 
But Devine it was, and the doomsayers and critics could only wait for the moment when he would lose, then point and say, "I told yr. so." The contagion spread, and students and fans found themsel· ,.s hoping for Irish losses. Few could explain their reasons for not wanting Devine, but it mattered little to them. 
Rational evaluation of the situation also mattered little to a press perenially obsessed with Notre Dame football. Sport magazine declared open season shortly after Devine's appointment with an article detailing his myriad offenses during his tenure at Green Bay. Not once did the article mention Devine's miracles in Missouri or Arizona State, but any such mention would have been wholly · inconsistent with the tone of the article. 
Three years later, the press is still trying to Bert Lance the man right out of his job. Bill Gleason's recent story in the Chicago Sun-Times about Devine ran under the banner, "Job in Jeopardy?" despite the fact that there was absolutely no public evidence that Devine's job was in danger. 
But Dan Devine is not a victim of the press. He is a victim of his job. He was hired to come to a school where he was not wanted, to coach players who didn't want to play for him, and he has been here for three years. But the most amazing thing about Devine's tenure has been the abuse and accusations and rumors that have swirled around the man's head ever since he came to Notre Dame. His critics seem to believe that Devine is out to ruin Notre Dame football, that he is inflicting malicious injury on teams that would have done better had he not been coaching. No one seems tq realize that Devine wants to win as badly as we want him to win. 
Devine stood in the locker room at Ross-Ade Stadium Saturday circled by reporters, answering their questions carefully and quietly. When he had finished, he turned and walked through the locker room. Terry Eurick stopped him. "Coach, I'm sorry I let you down," he said. Eurick had been playing, and playing well, with a painful back injury suffered against Pittsburgh. He finally left the Purdue game after playing three halves with the injury, "just gutting it out," as Scott Zettek put it. 
"No, no, ... " is all Devine could manage as he shook Eurick's hand. He continued through the locker room, shook a few hands, and slipped away unnoticed. 
It is one thing to play three halves of college football with the kind of pain that finally forced Eurick out. It is quite another to continue in a job for three years under the kind of intense, consistent pressure that Devine has experienced. "Gutting it out."
