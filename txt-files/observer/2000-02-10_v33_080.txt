Brian O'Donoghue presidential candidate 


O'Donoghue/Norton given two-day crunpaign suspension 

By LAURA ROMPF Associated News Editor 
In an 11-4 vote with seven abstentions, the Senate turned down an appeal from the Brian O'Donoghue/Brooke Norton ticket, which asked that its two-day campaign suspension from the Judicial Council be revoked. 
According to the Judicial Council, candidates O'Donoghue and Brooke Norton violated campaign rules when they appeared on a WVFI radio show Saturday. According to campaigning rules, candidates could not begin campaigning until mid­night on Monday. 
However, controversy arose in the Senate because of gray areas surrounding the defini­tion of campaigning. O'Donoghue and Norton did not realize that appearing on the radio was a violation of rules and thus their motives for the interview on WVFI were unclear. 
"Personally, knowing [O'Donoghue], I know he would never [purposefully I do anything in violation of the constitution," said Alumni Senator David Zachary. "However, ignorance of the law is not a defense." 
"The candidates made no efforts to solicit votes," junior .lay Smith, O'Donoghue and Norton's campaign manager,· said in a statement to the Senate. "They were engaged in a conversation on the radio about issues effecting the Notre Dame community. It is no different from you or I appearing on WVFI. If a dif­ference exists, it is because they are a known candidate, which they have no control over." 
According to the 
Council President. After a dis­cussion with her, he immedi­ately turned himself in for the violation. 
"Concessions are being made because [O'Donoghue) was honest and turned him­self in," Folks said. "He did not realize it wasn't allowed because it was not explicitly mentioned. I do not think his actions were malicious or even intentional, but this decision was made to be fair to other candidates."

The Faculty Senate also asked the provost tn comment on faculty representation in the University governance.

INSIDE COLUMN 
Arm yourself with the facts 
With the approaching Cnited States presiden­tial elections at hand and my personal involve­ment with the media, I thought it would be appropriate if l addressed my beliefs regarding the role of media in relation to government. Let me state for lhe record, though. that I am n<'ithcr a Amanda Greco government ma,ior nor a vPry politically-minded pPr­
son. assistant Scene editur 
We Americans nnbracP our democracy and the fret>doms it affords us. I Iowt>ver. I find the idea of a representative democracy to be an oxy­moron. On a l0t:11.l levPI. it makP.s sens!':, though few people use their persuasive voice in the local govP.rnmP.nt. When was the last time you wrote your representative? Do you eYen know who your local representative is? This is a tool too often left in the drawer. People opt for rnform on a larger scale, where it seems unfeasible that one voice could realistically n~present millions of people. 
Accurate representation occurs when we elect a reprnsenlative whose stances we know. It often seems that people are confused when it comes to picking a candidate. Recently, a Chitago radio station had a call-in !'or vot1irs who thought they knew their preffere<l candi­date. The callers went to .,vww.selectsmartcom to enter their opinions on political issues and find what candidate fit thei1· beliefs. All of' the callers found that the candidate who they had intended to vote for was not the candidate that supported their belief's. 
This brings me to my next grudge with our so­called democracy. It is based on a huge fallacy: It assunws an educated public and then goes out of its way to deceive said public. The musl com­mon medium through which WA rec0ive infor­mation is the media. namely tp,Jevision and print. Howev0r. media is notorious for providing a sen­sationalized, biased representation of the facts (often persuaded by funding received from polit­ical groups). 
Example: I am a member of the National Hille Association and receive its magazine monthly. One of the main features is a section entitled "The Armed Citizen." Here. one can read about the law-abiding citizens who have used their guns to proter.t themselves from robbery, rape and murder. Surprised that you don't hear these stories as the evening nmvs headlines? Well, I am. You are far more likely to hear of the armed person atternpLing the crime rather than the armed citizen defending himself or herself. 
Here's a little known fact: There are 65 million gun owners in the U.S., yet less than 0.2 percent of the guns owned are used in crimes. According to a survey conducted by criminologist Gary Kleck, there arr 2.5 million protective uses of firearms annually. This means that guns are used for protection five times more often than for the committal of crimes. But you won't get to hear about the good guys. 
This is just one example of the media's attempts at censoring the facts. Take advantage of the resources you have for unbiased informa­tion to create an informed opinion. And next time you turn on the news, allow yourself to be skeptical. Our constitutional freedoms that we so readily embrace will only be protected when we exercise our voice and arm ourselves with the facts.

U. Michigan protestors meet with administrators 
ANN ARBOH. Mich. 

Until Sunday many people at the university of' \1'ichigan had no idea what Michigamua was -that was before the Students of Color Coalition (SCCI occupied the secret society's meeting space and made public the organization's inner workings, which have been largely unknown since 
1902. 
Students, faculty and Ann Arbor residents were lined up until late Tuesday night. to view what SCC members claim is an atmosphere that is degrading to Native American cul­ture. 
"We're making this open to students ... (Michigamua) has never been infil­trated like this before," said Diego Bernal, a Social Work graduate stu­dent who is occupying the meeting space with SCC. 
Those who took the tour of the 
Iowa faculty petitions evaluation 
AMES, Iowa 
Claiming that the Iowa State Univnrsity administra­tion is responsible l'or creating "a climate of' fear and repression," several faculty mPmbers have written and are distributing a petition supporting an evaluation of !SU President Martin Jischke's performance as universi­ty president. Thn petition. which began circulating Tuesday and will continue until about Feb. 25, states. was written by several current and former faculty mem­bers. The prtition states that "many faculty and other concerned individuals arc dissatisfied with the declining importance of undergraduatP education and teaching, inad(iquate communication with faculty concerning the direction of the University. and a climate of' fear and repression that has been created at !SU." Jischke responded to the criticism Tuesday evening by saying Iowa State is making progress. "I think there's an over­whelming feeling across Iowa, within the University and the Board of Hegenl'>, that lowa State is a far better uni­versity today than it was 10 years ago, and if these p110­ple continue to complain, it is unfortunate, but I guess they have the right to do so," he said.

Arizona hate crime sparks march 
TUCSON, Ariz. 
Out of both support and outrage, members of the University of' Arizona community are rallying to the side of a gay student who was stabbed Sunday night while sitting outside a coffee shop. University of Arizona assistant English professor David Hobinson is one of' several people planning a protest march and speak-out event outside of the shop where the 20­year-old student was assaulted. The rally will feature an open mic for people to share anti-gay experiences and other thoughts on homophobia. Robinson, who is an acquaintance of the victim, was notified of the stabbing by a friend who witnessed the crime. After visiting the cafo the same night and speaking with other witnesses, Hobinson said he was inspired to organize the march and speak out. Robinson, along with the people hfl met with Sunday, the UA Pride Alliance and the Tucson chapter of a grassroots gay rights organization are working to make the march and speak-out happen. "We're in the midst of a lot of very vocal anti-gay spePch," Hobinson said. "That's the kind of stuff that fosters actual violence."

But Michigamua spokesman Nick Delgado said these items, and the majority of others on display to the public, were in storage prior to thP sec occupation. 
'The first time I'd cvPr seen Ithe fig­ure] was this morning when I picked up the paper,'' Delgado said at Tuesday night's Michigan Student Assembly meeting. 
He was reforring to a photo in Tuesday's Michigan Daily of the Native American figure lying on top of a book titled "Pride of 2000." The book and figure are not related and Delgado said that while the book was part of Miehigamua's practices, the figure must have been in the stprage space prior to thn occupation. 
"The question needs to be posed ­were these in the room when the sec took over'?" he asked. 
SCC members said they will be vigi­lant and will not vacate the meeting space until the University severs all ties with Michigamua. 
They are also demanding the space currently occupied by Michigamua be made into a cultural study lounge.

. Faculty Senate voted unanimouslv to send a motion and propos.ed an amendment to the Administration 

By MOLLY McVOY News Wrirer 
The speakers at Wednesday's brown bag luneheon said that their education at Saint Mary's involved more than classrooms and textbooks. 
As part of Social Justice Week at the College, M.J. Murray­Vachon, Class of 1982, Emily Hopkins, Class of 2000, and Ann Loux, an English professor, spoke on the issue of social jus­tice and everyday life. 
"Social justice, to me, is a search for truth and a search for the dignity in every individ­ual," Hopkins said. 
Hopkins hopes to go on to graduate school in social work, with a specialty in social justice. A passion to help those who cannot seem to help themselves drives her work at thC' Center for the IIomeless. 
"My only fear, and I guess my hope. is that I never lose that passion," Hopkins said. 
She explained that the first component to living a socially conscious life is changing one's mentality. People must first force themselves to seriously think about social issues in a differnnt way. 

"This was my biggest chal­lenge," Hopkins said. "It can be a challenge on this campus; it is somewhat homogeneous." 
Exposure to the poor and involvement with them is also crucial to social justice. She explained that without immers­ing oneself in poor communi­ties. feeling does not turn into action. 
"Exposure is the key," she said. "It turns those thoughts into actions." 
l\turray-Vachon agreed that exposure to the issues is the best way to awaken conscious­ness. For her, social justice is an extension of the responsibility that comes with being Christian. 
"Social _justice is how we, as Christians, take our faith into action everyday," Murray­Vachon said. 
After graduating from Saint Mary's, Murray-Vachon spent a year volunteering with Holy Cross Associates. This experi­ence helped change her atti­tudes about the poor and other social problems. 
"I learned that the world is so much bigger than my needs," Murray-Vachon said. 

She explained that people have a choice between what she calls the good life and the abun­dant life. She described the good life as the American dream: a career, a house and a car. The abundant life is what Christians are called to live: a life focused on community and religion. Communal living, faith development, service to the poor and simple living are all components of the abundant lifo. 
Murray-Vachon also worked with high risks families for six years as a therapist in the inner city of Chicago. 
"It was so humbling and so directing." she said. "They had so little hope. It was very pro­found."

STANSTED 
Contact with the hijackers of an Afghan airliner broke down Wednesday after the flight r.rew escaped, but police regained communica­tion and expressed confi­dence thev were on track to win release of the 150-plus hostages aboard. 
The negotiations became strained after four crew members staged a daring, midnight escape through a cockpit window. Police were left to wonder if anyone aboard could fly the Ariana airlines Boeing 727 if the hijackers chose to take off again. The plane had leapfrogged across Asia and Europe before arriving Stansted airport near London early Monday. 
"You can imagine their [the captors] reactions when they discovered that the. l1ight crew had gone," said Joe Edwards, an assis­tant chief constable of Essex County police. "Perhaps understandably. things went quiet." 
But contact resumed later Wednesday and negotiators grew more hopeful about the release of the 150-plus hostages. 

"We're more optimistic nnw, said Edwards. "Negotiations are where they should be." 
Negotiators insisted that the armed men had made no formal demands, politi­cal or otherwise. The men. believed to be Afghan dissi­dents armed with grenades, pistols and daggers. had requested only that food, water and other comfort items be brought to the plane, parked on a runway. 
Speculation mounted in the British media, however, that the plane was seized as part of an elaborate bid for political asylum -and that some of the roughly hostages were in on it. 
"HI-HOAX? Hijackers and hostages may be asylum seekers," the tabloid Mirror blared on its front page. The downmarket Daily Star lamented "Oh no! They ALL want to stay [and we'll have to pay]." 
Fueling the asylum specu­lation was the arrival Tuesday of an observer from the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. The observer would be providing exper­tise but would not be joining the negotiating team. 
Alaska Air inspects MD-80 jets 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES 
Alaska Airlines said it was inspecting its fleet of MD-80 jetliners Wednesday for damage to a key part in the tail system that may have playnd a crucial role in the crash of flight 261. 
Tile component. called a jackscrew. drives the hori­zontal stabilizer. which has become the focus of the investigation into the Jan. 31 crash that killed 88 peo­ple off the r.oast of Southern California. 
A two-foot section of the srrmv was found with the main wreckage of the 1\1D­83 about 10 miles off the r.oast. and the airline said the scrPw was found to bP stripped. 
"It appeared to investiga­tors who looked at the mechanism -that there was some damage to it," National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Jim Hali said in Chicago. "It was unclear whether the damage· was pre-impact or l'rom hitting the water." 
Alaska said it would inspect all 34 of its MD-80 series planes as a precau­tion. The inspection was not expected to cause sig­nitkant service delays 
The jarkscrew is pow­ered by two motors and resembles the corkscrew­like device that opens many automatic garage doors. 
lnvr.stigators are focus­ing on the stabilizer. a wing-like device on the jet's tail. because pilots reported problems with it after taking off from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, for San Francisco. 

If the jackscrew was damaged during flight. the horizontal stabilizer could move beyond its normal range, causing the tail wing to stall, or lose its lift, said William Waldock, associate direc­tor for the Center for Aerospace Safety Education . at Embry­Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott. Ariz. · 
It would be nearly impossible to recover from such a stall, Waldock said. 
The pilots would not be able to control the up-or­d own motion of the air­craft -which would be consistent with flight data that shows thP plane went into a 3.4-milc nosedive 
and radar tracking that shows something may have fallen off the plane as the dive began. 
The stabilizer moves up and down as a nut rides the jackscrew back and forth, explained aviation analyst John Nance of Tacoma, Wash. It was unknown whether the NTSB recovered the nut. 
"The system somehow came apart. separated or whatever and the stabiliz­er was free to flip up into the wind at a very severn angle." he said. 
"You put something like that directly into the wind at such an angle and it's going to fail. In the pr.ocess of failing. instead of just coming off the air­plane, it pulled the tail up and pulled the nose down." Nance said.

Hypertension drug effective in many ways

TRENTO~, N.J. 
Could an experimenLa] hypertension drug keep seniors with a common, but rarely treated, type of bor<lerline high blood pressure from dying or having a heart attack. stroke or heart failure? 
Sd!'ntists in 16 r.ountries, led by a r.ardiulogist at the Universitv of Medicine and Dnntistrv r,f New Jersey, have begun an extensive, live-year study to find the answ11r. They are hoping the mndication will prevenL patients' arteries from stiffening fur­ther and thus pushing their

patien Ls at about 900 sites around the world, according to the lead researcher, Dr. John B. Kostis. a cardiology professor and chairman of the Department of Medicine at CMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson :vledical School in New Brunswick. 
"It is a history-making clini­r.al trial." Kostis said last month. 
The study will test a Bristol­Myers Squibb Co. drug, called omapatrilat. on patients who have an early stage of what's called isolated systolic hyper­tension because only their sys­tolic blood pressure is above normal. 
Systolic pressure, the top number in a blood pressure reading, occurs when the heart contracts. forcing blood into the arteries: diastolic pressure, the lower number in a blood pressure reading, occurs when the heart relaxes between beats. Usually if one pressure is elevated, the other is high as well. 
From the 1950s until the l 990s. r.ardiologists and researchers focused on patients' diastolic pressure,

partly because the heart is at rest two-thirds of the time. Efforts to control hypertension concentrated on bringing down patients' diastolic prnssure until studies by Kostis and other researchers in the late 1990s showed that using diuretics prevented cardiac "events" such as heart attacks in many patients. 
Kostis said those studies showed that the level of a patient's systolic pressure was a better predictor than dias­tolic pressure of whPther their heart condition would worsen or kill them. 
"There is no proof that trnat­
in g the 
mildest 
could prove 
just that, 
said Kostis, who spent a dP-cade trying to organize and get funding for it. 
Bristol-Myers Squibb, which has its research headquarters in Princeton, is funding the study. It is hoping the federal Food and Drug Administration. which last month said it would expedite its evaluation of the drug, will approve it for sale by June. 
Half the patients will take a 20 mg or 40 mg dose of omap­atrilat each day and half will take a sugar pill. Neither the patients nor their doctors will know who got what until the study ends. Patients must be 65 or older and have a systolic blood pressure of 141 to 159 and a diastolic pressure below 90, 
"I think they're doing a great thing for whoever might need it," said Alfred Feld, 72. one of the first patients recruited. 
Feld, a retired salesman and manager in the textile industry, has had borderline high blood pressure for years but is always on the go with errands and civic ar.tivities. He doesn't want his heart condition to worsen and force him to slow down.

succession raises questions about the ability of the pilots of small airr.raft to monitor their own actions. said Jim Poole, the Chir.ago-bascd regional vice prnsident for the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. 
Control towers that do exist are often understaffed, and other towers that should still operate have been removed, leaving pilots that sometimes have very little flying experi­ence to muddle through a take­off or landing with no guid­anr.e, he said. 
"Certainly you're cutting the cost ... but you're also cutting the safety," Poole said.­
Most of the time, the "rulfls of the road" approach to flying works, PM statistics show. In 1998, for 8Xample, general avi­ation aircraft -those that are not government, military or commercial -had 1,907 acci­dents, or 7.12 per 100,000 flight hours. Of those, 361 were fatal. 
Midair r.ollisions were extremely rare, with prelimi­nary NTSB data for 1999 show­ing 18 such r.rashes. 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO 
Two recent collisions involv­ing small airplanes have some urging improved air traffic control for such aircraft, which often take off and land at far.Hites without control towers. 
On Tuesday, two small planes collided over suburban Chicago, killing three and sending smoldering wreckage into a densely populated area. Only a day before, four people died in Los Angeles al'ter their planP.s collided over a golr course. 
Those who fly such planes call the collisions Mondav and Tuesday a tragic fluke. Bu\ oth­ers argue the accidents point to a problem. 
National Transportation Safety Hoard investigators were sorting through wreckage Wednesday in Zion, about 45 miles north of' Chicago, lo find clues lo what caused Tuesday's crash over a hospital. 
The crash killed popular Chicago radio personality Bob Collins and a friend flying with him, as well as the student pilot flying the other plane. 

A control tower at the nearby Waukegan Regional Airport had cleared both Collins· two­seat Zlin stunt plane and the four-seat Cessna 172 to land, one aftp,r the other. 
But in this case, as with most operations of small. noncom­mercial planes. it was up to the pilots to make sure their air space was clear before landing, officials said. 
In fact, the presence of a con­trol tower at the Waukegan airport -and at the Van Nuys Airport. near the site of Monday's crash in Los Angeles -is unusual. 
Warren Morningstar, a spokesman for the Maryland­based Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, said only 543 of the about 5,300 public­use airports in the United States have control towers. 
Tha.t means pilots of smaller planes that are not tracked by radar must rely on a common radio frequency, their instru­ments and their eyes to assure safety, Morningstar said.

"We don't think that we have a crisis situation here," Rick Collins, director of the depart­ment's Water :Vlanagement Division, said Tuesday. However, he continued, "I don't want you to go away thinking everything's under control." 
Small amounts of MTHE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether, first came into use in gasoline in the 1970s to boost octane and later, in greater amounts, to "oxy­genate" gas, reducing pollution 
coming out of automobile tailpipes. 

unsophisticated
Following the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1990, federal authorities ordered the phase-in of oxygenates in gasoline sold in the nation's smoggiest urban areas. 
Terry Wigglesworth, executive director of the Oxygenated Fuels Association, an Arlington, Va.­based trade group, said Maryland has enjoyed tremen­dously cleaner air because of MTBE. 
Concerns about the petrochem­ical arose in the mid-l 990s when a European study linked MTBE to liver and kidney tumors in mice.

But Dick noted that since the FBI docs not know who conducted the attacks, it's "always a possibility" that a foreign government is responsible. 
"Until you get to the key­board being utilized, you don't know what you're dealing with," Dick said. Ile noted that most similar, past attacks used somfl overseas computers as well

WASHINGTON 
This week's computer attacks on Intermit sites are the largest in memory but aro not particularly sophis­ticated and easily could have been launched by one 15-yflar-old boy, a senior FBI official said Wednesday. 
Ron Dick, chief of the FBI's computer investiga­tion section, said the bureau could not solve the crime or prevent future Internet vandalism without considerable help from the private sector. "We're going to need the help of everyone in the com­munity to

"This is a wakeup call," said Commerce Secretary William Daley. "I don't think these incidents should cause people not to go online to do whatever busi­ness they're doing." 
Dick said the week's van­dalism was accomplished using "distributed denial of service" tools. 
In such attacks, a hacker hides these tools, known as daemons, on hundreds or even thousands of innocent third-party computers. The daemons can be triggered later from a remote location to launch simultaneous attacks on a single target, such as Yahoo! or eBay. The attacking daemons give false addresses so they are harder to trace. 
The volume of attacks overwhelms the target and causes it to cease opera­tions, much the same way that a very heavy volume of telephone calls can tie up a phone system and leave most users with no dial tone or a busy signal, Dick said. 
Many tools for such an attack exist on Internet Web sites, and anyone can down­load them, he said. "They t h i s

In addition to not knowing 
who is responsible, the FBI 
also does not know how 
many innocent third-party 
computers were used to 
launch them and does not 
know if the attacks have 
ended, Dick said. 
Agents are starting from victim computers and track­ing the attacks back through the Internet service providers that delivered the attacking daemons. Dick likened it to tracking a trail left by bank robbers from the bank to their lair. Tom Burke, of the General Services Administration, said no attacks had been traced thus far to govern­ment computers. 
Dick urged the private sector to report any attacks promptly so tracing can begin quickly. And he urged private Internet sites to keep logs of traffic, install any tools developed to thwart such attacks and keep them updated. 
Over the New Year's weekend, the FBI posted tools that could detect whether two types of dae­mons were hidden on a computer system. Some 2,600 businesses down­loaded the FBI tools at no cost and three found such daemons, prompting the FBI to open criminal inves­tigations of who put them there.

Official asks for better IRA response 
Associated Press 
LONDON 
Britain's top official for Northern Ireland appealed Wednesday for the Irish Republican Army to "respond in a constructive way" to calls for disarmament, hoping to save the province's fledgling Cabinet. 
The plea. from Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson camr, a day after the Ilouse of Commons passed emergency legislation that would allow Britain to sus­pend the Cabinet's consider­able powers and restore so­called direct rule from London. 
Mandelson has vowed to lift the powers Friday, after the bill makes it way through the upper House of Lords. But he indicated a positive response by the IRA could forestall the move. 
"Nobody is asking for sur­render by the IHA." Mandelson told the Commons. "Nobody is asking for humilia­tion to be heaped on the IRA." 
He said he hoped the IRA "will understand this need and even at this 11th hour respond in a constructive way." 
The crisis was spurred Jan. 31 when a report by an inde­pendent disarmament com­mission, which was estab­lished the year before the 1998 Good Friday peace accord. indicated the IRA had made no concrete commit­ments toward disarming. 

The major Protestant party within the power-sharing Cabinet, the Ulster Unionists, had agreed to form the four­party coalition -which includes the IRA-linked Sinn Fein -only on condition that IRA start getting rid of weapons. 
Mandelson disclosed Wednesday that the disarma­ment committee might issue a further report before the end of the week. which could buy the British government some time if it contained any posi­tive news. 
"In that context. I would make this appeal to the lead­ers of all the political parties in Northern Ireland -that they shouldn't close their minds to any further develop­ments," he said. ''Nobody wants any of the political par­ties to walk away from the peace process, because we want this to work." 
The Ulster Unionists have scheduled a meeting Saturday for grassroots members to vote whether to remain in the 12-member Cabinet. 
Forming another adminis­tration would prove extremely difficult, since it would require a new election in Northern Ireland.

Let sick students through the gate! 
Going to the Health Center for medical treatment is apparently no easy task. For those who do not already know. off-cam­pus students must walk half a mile from the parking lots or wait at the call box for security to provide a ride (assuming one is too ill to walk). In no case is a student allowed to drive to the building -this requires permitting the student with the privilege of driving a vehicle on campus. 
The woman at the gate mumbled to me the options available, lowered the bar before me (a deterrent I suppose), closed her window and ignored me until I left. 1 had no intention of waiting in the cold and snow for a security officer, so it was either the visitor's lot by the library or the lots by the JACC. 
Influenced by the impetus for my jour­ney to the Health Center, I spontaneously called campus security to disr:uss the matter. Well, I am sure you can imagine how uninterested, uninformative and insulting the conversation went for me. I do not want sympathy for my little walk, only improvement on a system that actu­ally disservices those for which it suppos­edly exists. Of r,ourse, I heard how busy the gates are and the number of students who will say anything to get on campus {before noon on a Monday, what a securi­ty risk!). There is also the legitimate con­cern over parking space. 
I suggested some form of control given the effective means of confirming a visit to the Health Center; students all register at the front desk before receiving any medical attention. The security oflicial lit­erally chuckled at me for being foolish enough to believe that there is a way to check on whether or not a student attends the Health Center after gaining access to campus. The detached voice went on to "inform" me that the truly sick thank the gate worker and freely accept the long walk while the truly healthy get infuriated at security. By this time, I gave up on the conversation. The official was neither surprised nor concerned when I informed her that I was calling from the Health Center and extremely dissatisfied. This deviation from the "norm" fell on deaf ears. 

My question is, why is this such a strained relationship? It seems security could care less about the students: the less, the better. They witness emotion in a driver and perr,eive it as an indication of a lie to get on to the campus? Surely the investigative capabilities of these individ­uals are obviously unimpressive to us all. 
Maybe you too know of a HA who sneaks anything desired onto campus or the infamous "someone who knows someone." Many others manipulate the system by using the right to drive a female student back to her dorm. Limited parking and alcohol are apparently the problems. The current solution is to deny anyone unlucky enough to not be able to pull strings access to the place we pay to attend. 
Conversation with a nurse at the Health Center informed me that she too walked from the library. My status as a student compels me to place our rights first. but it is unwise to ignore the rights of the work­ers on campus. Politics aside the issue is troublesome. Campus size is not increas­ing, but the number of buildings and the number of students (as well as workers to fill those buildings) are on the rise. 
Parking lots, however functional, do not add value to a visit to Notre Dame. Aside from asking the ultimate question of for whom does this not-for-profit organiza­tion cater its offerings, the issue of access to campus remains. How many students and parents knew this before enrollment? One might cast aside all hope, except that complacency is not a trait a university of this level should endorse. 
In the example of the Health Center, it seems students could r,all ahead to get an appointment and the Health Center could call the appropriate gate with a name and time for access. A simple one strike, you're out rule would eliminate the potential for frequent abuse of such a sys­tem by the compulsory liars security sees in us all. Yes, the gates are busy. Maybe the answer is quicker service and more flexibility. After all, students already attempt to get on campus quite often. If it is "no" to most students and "no" to most workers, then why allow the charade to continue with those volatile conversa­tions? Letting more people in quicker would shorten that line of cars signifi­cantly. Security knows our address and car registration. Together with an ID, this confirms one's legitimate status. For des­tinations that rer,ord one's presence ­like the Health Center -security r,an monitor the truth in the proclaimed desti­nation. 
Failure to adhere? More fines would suffir:e. Hey, at least this gives incentive to tell the truth {present conditions provide incentives to lie to security until they lift that orange bar). The timing of acr,ess passes and parking lot surveys are impor­tant considerations. However. if security has enough time to pick me up and drive me to a building, then they have enough time to undertake these tasks (ever won­der what security does all day?). 
There are ways to assure that those who tell the truth are driving to where they say. Semrity told me ofno plans of anything like this and prodaimed zero tolerance was the best policy. 
Given this unwillingness to change, given students' tendencies to lie, given the safety enjoyed by all on r,ampus, I feel that some cases (not necessarily all) war­rant allowing students the right to drive a vehicle on the r,ampus paid for in part by our tuitions. On my biased list. medical attention deserves much more leniency. If at noon on a Monday one cannot drive to the Health Center, when and where are the appropriate time and destinations? Next time I will use those.

While this ticket boasts extensive expe­rience in programming, IIanover/Micek does lack the policy-making knowledge of other tickets. including O'Oonoghue/Norton and Osborne/Donahey. This should not prove detrimental to the team's overall objec­tives if educated appointments are Ilanover/Micek's first order of business. 

Surrounded by people who have worked extensively with the student union constitution, Hanover and Micek will expedite their plans, making imple­mentation of projects like "The Shirt" for men's and women's basketball and free tutoring for all students more probable. 
Hanover and Micek recognize students' current discontent with their lack of inlluence in University decisions and the growing need for augmented campus services. A strong, dynamic team, they are dedicated to tackling campus issues in a realistic, timely and innovative man­ner. 
Their commitment to excellence secures Hanover and Micek as the best candidates to represent Notre Dame's student body in the first years of the new millennium.

Thanks for gay speak-out 
I am writing to applaud Saint Mary's for having the decency to allow its lesbian alumnae the opportunity to come back on campus to share their stories. 
When l first decided to go listen to the alumnae panel speaking I felt apprehensive -would 1be made to feel uncomfortable? Would people think I was gay? Would I be the only student there? When I left I felt enlightened -as well as ashamed of my own previously unknown prejudices. 
Identity Week was just a small step in the changes that need to be made. So many times heterosexuals take for granted the rights they have that the gay community is lacking. The right to marry the person one chooses. to have significant others placed on health insurance plans and to be true to oneself without having to worry about being mocked. spit on, hurt or even killed for per­sonal views. Especially important is the right not to be labeled and have that label care­lessly thrown around as a hateful insult. 
People need to think next time they refer to something as gay, retarded. Jewish, queer, etc., about the individuals they could inadvertently be offending. 
There are unbelievable stories about the biases the courageous w'omen I heard speak, as wPII as other members of the gay population, have been forced to endure. There is so much heartache and pain. And why? Because some choose to live their lives outside the realm ofsociety's ideals'! 
Being a pro-choice agnostic I understand what it is like not to fit in. I cannot even fathom how these women must have felt. Acceptance is key. I urge people to see beyond their stereotypical ideals and acknowledge no one can categorize what it is to love. That there are others -people that eat, sleep, breathe and cry just as they do -that live slightly different lifestyles. But that they are still people deserving of our respect, approval and understanding. Please put an end to this wasteful intoler­ance of humanity's differences and celebrate our uniqueness.

Has Notre Dame entered an alternate universe? lfardly! The Shakespeare Festival 2000 is actually the result of an energetic movement to bring live Shakespearean theater annually to Notre Dame and the greater South Bend r,omrnunity. At the heart of this summer's inaugural festival are six per­formances of "The Taming of the Shrew," opening Aug. 2 through Aug. 6. 
The primary goal of the summer Shakespeare Festival is to merge liter­ary Shakespearean scholarship with dramatic performance, or, as Rathburn defines it, "the marriage of 'Shakespeare in the study' to 'Shakespeare on the stage."' Rathburn challenges the long-standing "war" between academics and theater profes­sionals as absurd. convinr,ed that the two approarhes were

Rathburn has long advocated this combined approar.h to studying Shakespeare. He has taught the playwright twice for the Notre Dame London program. where students were privileged to study thoroughly several plays over the semester, attend various stage productions and even to speak with actors following-the perfor­mances. But Rathburn felt these experi­ences should not be limited to London. Bark in South Bend. he thought about creating a course that incorporated both the academir. and theatrical approaches to ShakPspearean studies. 
In 1989, thanks lo a Lily Endowment Grant for the development of new courses. Hathburn designed an experi­mental class entitled "Shakespeare in Performanre." Founded on the idea that Shakespeare's works arc theatrical scripts as well as literary texts, the course required students to perform four times each semester. 
Convinced that the class ought to be team-taught by a Shakespearean schol­

Have you ever won­dered what goes on at Notre Dame after stu­dents leave in May? You might pir­ture dark, 
program, and the 
seeds of the Shakespeare Festival 2000 
started to germinate. 
Rathburn enthuses, and his energy is .contagious: "This is the most exciting 
moment in the history of Notre Dame 
theater!" 
Through the Shakespeare Initiative, 
six dynamic theatrical events are con­
verging upon the normally staid Notre 
Dame campus. Not only is the 
University construrling a new perform­
ing arts center. but the initiative 
intends to insure that Shakrspoare 
becomes an integral part of university 
life, enriching both LhP undergraduate 
edur.ation and the community's cultural 
resources. 
In addition to building Lhf' center for 
performing arts, the Shakespeare 
Initiative includes five major compo­
nents. In July of 2000, the renowned 
professional repertory company ACTEH 
(A Center for Theatre Education and 
Research) will change its operational 
home from thr, University of North 


This is Washington Hall, a full Washington Hall. One of the primary reasons for the Summer Shakespeare Festival 2000 is to fill the emptiness of Washington Hall during the summer months. The festival will run from July 17 until Aug. 6. 
ar and a theater veteran to fully explore the material, Hathburn enlisted the help of professional drama coach Carol MacLeod, a retired Broadway actress who also claimed television and film credits. The incredibly popular course soon required a student audition to par­ticipate. 
The success of "Shakespeare in Performance" inspired Rathburn to think bigger, and he began dreaming of a project that could bring Shakespeare 
to an even greater 
number of 
Carolina to Notre Dame. 

The 25-year-old organization. ro­founded by Patrick Stewart and mem­bers ol' the Royal Shakespearean Company, embodies the combined liter­ary/theatrical approach to Shakespeare. The group annually sponsors perform­ers from Great Britain who travel the 
U.S. as "Actors from the London Stage," performing and teaching in university classrooms. Notre Dame will host 10 actors in residence each year -five per semester -and Notre Dame will serve as the home base for ACTEH's national tour. 
Secondly, the Initiative is developing a named Chair in Shakespeare/ACTEH for performance and dramatic literature. who will function as ACTEH's artistir director. The Chair will research, pub­lish and teach in the field and partic­ipate in the direction of Notre Dame produrtions of the works of Shakespeare and his contemporaries. 
Third. the initiative provides for an endowed Suminer Shakespeare Festival at Notre Dame, which is currrmtly being developed by Hathburn. The sum­
mer festival intends "We're building something at large. Summer to apprentice stu­Notre Dame oflasting value, Shakespeare at

The fund would also allow Notre Dame to host noted Shakespearean scholars to give lectures and seminars, and would provide an invaluable oppor­tunity to hear the field's leading critics and experts. Finally, the $1 million Library Endowment would be used to enhance the University's collection of Shakespeare-related documents and scholarship, and funds would permit Notre Dame faculty to take a more prominent role in the international world of Shakespearean scholarship. 
One might assume this project could simply continue to elevate the level of the moat separating Notre Dame from South Bend, but don't dismiss it as another elitist academic event. Part of the program's mission is to make live Shakespearean performance arcessible to as many people as possible through­out Michiana. 
"We're building something at Notre Dame of lasting value, for the good of the entire community," Rathburn said. 
Clearly, Notre Dame has disrovered a project to break down the barriers 
between itself and 
the community at 
dents. 

The project includes a three-week Shakespeare camp from July 17 through Aug. 6 for 48 to 64 local and national high school students. After auditioning in early June. students accepted to the program will begin an intensive two-week rehearsal period in July, spending the

EDITORIAL COMMENTARY 

Last year's leaders, this year's candidates lack vision 
Ten tickets will compete for your vote Monday. Some arc experienced. some are fresh, some are just plain wacky. But what none of' them can do is combine student government know-how with a ·vision or what this great University should be. 
Many of' the lesser-known candidates want to voice stu­dent the potMtial to ar,t as a voir,e for the students, but the election pror:ess and the com­plicated nature of Student Union leadership will make it nearly impossible for any of those tickets to emerge victori­ous. And. unfortunately, few of these candidates are running to win. 
Several tickets have the typi­cal student government experi­ence on their resume: Student Senate. class ofncer, ser.tion leader, etc. But unfortunatelv, these tickets come out of a sys­tem that. in recent years, has created followers instead of leaders. These juniors have too often spent thP last two yPars looking up to presidencies that focused on minor initiatives. such as onlin,1 book buying and planning pep rallies. These conveniences are nice, and they do make life at Notre Dame a litLle better, but they do not suffice when it r.omes to motivating students for impor­tant change. 
It was telling in their inter­views with The Observer all lO tickets focused on the specitic, 
Too often, students are expected to choose from a roster ofcandidates who fall into two categories: unqualified visionaries and qualified people who lack vision. 
an<l minor, plalform planks that they hoped to systemati­r.ally implement to entertain or pacify students. None put forth a philosophy of how to r,hange Notre Dame. None discussed how to truly make this school a better place. 
None had vision. 
Too often, students are expected to choose from a ros­ter of candidates who fall into 

two categories: unqualified visionaries and qualified peo­ple who lack vision. Student alienation f'rorn the student government process only emphasizes the frustrations caused by this choice. Whether 
it is because our leaders do not listen, or because they do not act. the majority of the students tune out the student government. 
No one in the undergraduate student body has been here long enough to remember a strong, effective leader work­ing on the second t1oor. of Larortune. As a result, none of the candidates has a strong, effective example to follow. One of them must take the lead and set an example if stu­
dent government is ever going to rise above the petty policy squabbles and minor program­ming initiatives that have characterized the past several years. 
The "accomplishments" of the last two administrations has been an uninspiring litany of basketball pep rallies, improved Student Union coop­eration and a lot of barbecues. Their legacy is uninspiring presidential candidates who do not aspire to become more than that. 
It has been too long since the students had a true leader in the student body president's ol'flce. We hope this year's winner, whoever it is, will prove, or learn, to be one.

Believe. 

"We believe in leadership. No one seems to believe in that anymore." 
Experience 
O'Donoghrn~ has sPrVPd two terms as Keough Hall senator, two on the Campus Life Council and has sat on more than 1::i committees dealing with student lifo issues. Norton is sophomorr class vice prr,sidont. was freshman class secretary and has participated in Walsh Hall government. 
Platform goals 
. 
To create and expand acadrmir srrvires likr the Internet book-swap, an online course guide and course development grants for professors 

. 
To improve student life through discounts at local businesses, a scholarship search service and a dorm endowment fund that would allow rectors to provide students with funds in Amergrncy situations 

. 
To open a satellite Grab 'n' Go site in DeBartolo and a Becker's-like cafc in North Dining llall 


Best idea 
Uniting undergrads through campus-wide pro­grams: supplying more student tickets for away football ga,mes and promoting Planet Irish, a Web sitr brimming with information for students 
Worst idea 
O'Donoghue and Norton said they would keep silent about issues or information -like the pro­posed cancellation of Sophomore Sibs Weekend -if they believed it was in students' best interests or if administrators requested it. 

Most feasible idea 
Most ideas itrn practicable thanks to diligent and comprehensive research. Some concepts, however, mirror those attempted or planned by previous administrations. 
least feasible idea 
O'Donoghue's conviction that administrators will consider him a colleague simply because he repre­sents 8.000 students 
Experienced and passionate, O'Donoghue and :'Jorton have created an extensive, realistic plan. The candidates' dedication to campus unity through programming is admirable, but they generally lack innovative programs. 
Their ideological ambition is refreshing, but as student government insiders, they don't seem to perceive undergraduates' growing discontent with representatives' inability to accomplish tasks or speak on students' behalf.

Platform goals

. 
lmprov<·cl student relations; support of a more div<(J"SP rnmmunity and inrlusion or sexual orienta­tion in the University's non-discrimination clause 


Best idea 
Instituting a Jlornecoming weekend; a block or l'ootball tickets would be set asidP for recent gradu­ate and dorm Pvents would highlight the weekend. 

Experience 
Higgins' and Pardon's experience comes from their 2 l/2 years on campus as well-informed studimts. Pardon also is this year's Shirt coordi­nator and has worked on The Shirt project for, two year:;. 
Platform goals 
. 
Frank disrussion about scxualitv, condom distribution and making available information about abortion 

. 
!Told grn.duation ceremonies in Notre Dame Stadium 

. 
13riug back Sophomore Sibs Weekend and Saf'eHid.c 


Best idea 
Cutting down on student fees (e.g. ticket costs, dining hall charge if you lose your ID) 
Worst idea 
Reversing the balance of faculty and administra­

tion on University committees 
Most feasible idea 
Bringing in more speakers to talk about a wider range of issues that concern students 
least feasible idea 
Fostering frank discussion of sexuality, and condom distribution on this campus 
Everybody knows guys like Pardon and Higgins. They live down the hall, they go to the dining hall, they like to sleep in. They say they're willing to take on the administration to get the things they want, and that they'll go around the Dome to ask alumni for help if neces­sarv. 
Tbcir candidacy is refreshing. but their lack of experience and details about how to implement their platform goals show that, unfortunately, these normal guys lack the know-how to get the job done. 

Worst idea 
While the ticket believes "you can't legislate toler­ance," it is also unmotivated to program events that could incrnase diversity education. 
Most feasible idea 
lnviting the "untapped resource" of students in clubs and organizations Lo engage in student gov­ernment leadership and community events 
least feasible idea 
Major curriculum changes, though creative and worthy of research, are unlikely to be implemented by student government and surely will not be accomplished in this pair's term. 
Osborne and Donahey are articulate, driven and in-tune with' specific nieds. Their initiatives, which include an off-campus housing network and expanded tutoring services, show an understanding of how programs can ease students' daily concerns. 
Their platform goals, however. are broad and long-term, and the candidates lack necessary research in many areas. With only one year in office, it seems this team could accomplish quick-hit plans but might leave major issues untackled.

Like most. freshmen. ljjese two have very little experience with Notre Dame student govern­ment. Scialliz served in his church group at honrn, and Saracino was the first evPr wrirn-in vote to be elcr:ted treasurer of bis high school. 
Platform goals

To tear down Keenan-Stanford and replace it with an undPrage bar 

. 
To build a 24-hour bowling alley underneath South Quad 

. 
To chnngr. Notre Dame's moniker from th<' Fighting Ir.ish to a great big smiley face, to be worn by whomever was most recently impeached from the student body presidency 


Best idea 
Placing greater emphasis on k1wping up with student opinion 
Worst idea 
Demolishing Keenan-Stanford and giving its 
residents only tents and table sugar in return 
Most feasible idea 
Bi-weekly student opinion polls in the dining halls 
Least feasible ideas 
Constructing an amusement park and bowling alley under South Quad, and impeaching the president as soon as possible -thus making it impossible for anyone to stay in office more than two or thre(. weeks 
Sc.iallis and SarnciIJo are a pair of likable fresh­men with some intMesUng ideas. They make a good point that varying student interests and opin­ions are not given enough importance in student government at present, but their solutions to this problem are questionable. 
While the idea of rotating 10-day presidencies is sure to maintain an influx of new ideas. it is unlikely to afford any one president the time tu affect change. And blowing up Keenan and Stanford in the dark of night is just a bad idea.

Experience 
Shepherd has served two years as class president and as a member of the Cesaro/Solak student body administration. I-le also served a semester as an employee of the University \,Veb administrator. Focht has collaborated with Shepherd and University offices on many platform issues. 
Platform goals 
. 
To review the allocation of funds within stu­dent government 

. 
To increase campus communication through Plant Irish. a comprehensive student Web site. and by publishing Teacher Course Evaluations 

. 
To ensure 24-hour social space in the new Student Center 


Best idea 
Educating students on how to vote by absentee ballot in their home state elections; the pair expressed concern for student indifference to their civic responsibilities and seek to raise greater political awareness on campus.

Todd Warapius  George Coppinger

Zahm Hall  Knott Hall  


Worst idea 
The dismissal of SafeRide as too large an under­taking for student government; while they acknowledge the need to address student drunk driving, their skepticism about this existing pro­gram, however struggling, is unfortunate. 
Most feasible idea 
Increasing awareness of and participate in stu­dent programs through the Internet, e-mail, WVFI and other campus media. 
Least feasible idea 
The publication of TCEs online for student review; the pair has the ambition and information to accomplish this aim. but the probability of it actually happening is low because its success would rely on the approval of the administration. 
Well researched and committed to the academic mission of' the University. Shepherd and Focht have strong ideas, but they lack the concrete plans neces­sary for implementation, particularly those concern­ing diversity. Their dedication to making student gov­ernment more accessible is feasible, however. and their emphasis on academic life is refreshing. 
Experience 
Warapius currently is conducting mind control tests in the basement uf Haggar Hall, while Coppinger is huilding a "doomsday nrnchine" in Fitzpatrick. They also arc f1ueut in Jedi lauguages. 
Platform goals

. Ending destructive conflict 

.

Best idea 
Improving the campus music srene; inviting bands from across the galaxy might prove difficult, however 
Worst idea 
To institute new forms of punishment for stu­dents: women will be made slnvci dancers at Senior Bar. while men will be subjected to carbon freez­ing 
Most feasible idea 
Changing the student government structure so leaders are no longer democratically elected but centrally appointed 
Least feasible idea 
If mature discussion with administrators fails to get this ticket's plans passed, Jedi mind tricks of persuasion will be implemented. 
This pair is r,reative and willing to push the bounds of current institutions. If implemented, their syslem of government would likely be more efficient than the turrent om~ in LaFortune. 
However, the candidates' emphasis on strict despotism and constituents' complete obedience with threat of physical damage for those who don't comply will certainly silence students excited to dedicate their pnrsonal tahmts nnd ideas to student leadership.

remains: Are we on some level sexually attracted to our friends? 
It stands to reason that certain relationships begin on the basis of ­physical attraction. However. many of these evolve into friend­ships that are unconnected to that original attraction. 
Thero are some friendships. though. that begin for more ambiguous reasons but lead to a more intimate relationship. This docs not necessarily disrupt the original friendship. 
To complicate the situation even further, some individuals are "hook-up buddies." These friend­ships arc composed of people who have a physical relationship but are able to maintain a separate, unaffocted friendship. 
So my final answer: YES. men and women can be friends without sex or desire getting in the way. However, isn't a good friendship with a little lovin' on the side the perfect relationship? 
The age-old question that res­onates through the romantic come­dy "\Nhen Harry met Sally" is can men and women be friends? In the movie. Billy Crystal states that the problem with male and female relationships is the sexual tension which lies between them and makes it impossible to maintain a friendship. The movie also states that once a man and woman suc­cumb to their desire for one anoth­er, the friendship is lost. So is that true here at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's? · 
On the surfar,e -no way. Both myself and Scott quoted "the friend" as a category of the oppo­site sex -a great person to hang 
· out with. the one you call with problem5, r,omplimenting your personality-but ofno sexual interest. All of lhe men and women here have many friends of the opposite sex -the friends in class, the drinking buddies. the advice givers and so on. The question still

Moral lessons abound in Stone's 'Wall Street' 
-
I ('an remember being very young and hearing that "Wall Street" was going to premiere on network television. Being in a family that did not have cable until 1996, any major motion picture debut on the "basic rhanncls" was always a big deal in our household. I watched for a while1

Pntirety. I was in awe of the powerful acting and the 
intense moral questions the movie raises. 
Growing up a "city kid," Iwas always r,urious about. the day-to-day habits of those men and womrm from my neighborhood who braved the downtown I.R.T. to the mecca of the business world that was Wall Street. 
Oliver Stone's remarkable film transports us to 1986, where we meet Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen). a young execu­tive bored with his tpdious job as a trader. He dreams of ber,urning a heavy hitter in his corporate profession and sets his sighL-; on a famous Wall Street wizard named Gordon Gckko (Michael Douglas). 
Bud sees his future and dream of fortune in Gordon, the epitome~ of the '80s stor,k and rrnl-estate speculator. Always Lhe studious and honest hard worker, Bud soon realizes that in order to make it to the top of the corporate ladder n.nd become a power player among the business world elite, he mlLc.;t lie. cheat and steal.

His departure leaves open one of the most important collegiate administrative position in the country. It's unknown as to who the powers that be have their collective eye on or even for what qualities they're looking. 
They've made one thing abun­dantly clear. however. 
Experienr,e as an athletic direr,tor is an important asset to have if not a must. 
While it's tempting to then rule out anyone from within lhe bub­ble of the Dome and look to other schools to help fill the posi­tion. doing so would mean over­looking a perfectly capable replacement. 
Melissa Conboy, a 1982 gradu­ate of Notre Dame has worked in the Notre Dame athletic depart­ment since 1987, serving first as an assistant athletic director until 1992 when she was pro­moted to the role of associate athletic director. 
She has experience within the athletic department and the NCAA itself. 
This experience gives Conboy much knowledge of the intrica­cies specific to the Notre Dame athletic department and the complexities of the NCM. These attributes should far outweigh her lack of experience as the head executive. 
Plus, she's a Domer. 
As arguably the first great female athlete from Notre Dame, playing basketball from 1979­1982, Conboy understands the different standards to which Notre Dame attempts to hold its athletes and coaches. She under­stands the difficulties Notre Dame faces in recruiting due to these standards, and the ditlicul­ties athletes encounter in mak­ing sure that both sides of the hyphen in the word student-ath­lete are equally attended to. 

She's proven herself worthy. Conboy currently administers the Irish ice hockey, volleyball and women's basketball teams and oversees both tennis and soccer programs. In her tenure, both women's basketball and women's soccer, debatably the two most successful programs next to fencing at Notre Dame, became national powerhouses. Volleyball and men's and women's tennis made their respective post-season tourna­ments last year. 
Conboy has been in charge of nearly every team that wins con­sistently. 
She conducts herself with class and an amiability that's conta­gious. She's an eloquent speak­er and handles the press well. 
She has the experience, the personality, the ability and the knowledge to fill the position. And while the male-centered culture of Notre Dame's student body and administration might find problem in promoting a woman to be in charge of its pre­cious athletic program. leaving Conboy's name off a list of potential candidates would be a grievous omission.

Przybilla shocks Hoosiers with 33

MINNEAPOLIS 

Joel Przvbilla scored a carcer­high 33 points. including the game-winning basket with 3.9 seconds left. and Minnesota stunned No. 10 Indiana 77-75 Wednesday night. 
A.J. Guyton, who scored 27 points despite a 17 l/2-minute drought. was several feet short on a desperation 3-pointer at the buzzer. sending the Golden Gophers and the standing room­only crowd at Williams Arena into a frenzy. 
The Gophers (12-9. 4-7 Big Ten) gave first-year coach Dan Monson his biggest victory yet at Minnesota. 
Kirk Haston scored 24 points for the Hoosiers ( 17-4, 7 -3). who haven't won at Williams Arena in five yt>ars. His two free throws with l :08 left gave Indiana a seemingly safe 75-70 lead.

NBA 

Rodman thrills crowd in return 
Associated Press 
DALLAS 
It didn't take long for Dennis Rodman to make his prcsenee felt in Oallas, on and nff the 
court 
Playing before a boisterous s e l l o u t crowd that featured D e i o n Sanders 

11. n d Rodman Emmitt Smith sit­ting courtside, Rodman 
grabbed nine rebounds and took a hard foul that briel1y knocked out Seattle's 11 uben Patterson in just his first half as a Mavrrick. 
Hodman, who wore No. 70. didn't look like a 38-year-oJd guy v,·ho has been out of thf' NBA for 10 months. In 16 minutes. he also had three fouls and a length-of-the court assist f'ollnwing one rebound. There was one sign ol' rust: he got caught playing illegal defense twice, the sec­ond giving Seattle a technical free throw. 
Rodman was aggressive from the get-go. snatching the game's first miss and being fouled bv Vin Baker. Then Patterson·made the mistake of trying to drive to the hoop through Rodman. Both went down. but only Hodman got up. Patterson, who was called for a charge. remained IJat on his face for several minutes. 

Rodman sat out the first few minutes of the second quar­ter. but he grabbed the first available rebound when he returned, There was a near blowup soon after, though, as 
he was called for two quick 
fouls -both of' which he dis­
agreed with. 

Rodman, obviously peeved. 
ran upcourt cupping the ball 
as if he were going to heave 
it. but instead marched to the 
far sideline and placed it 
down softly. 

He spent the last 2:42 of the 
quarter on the bench, then 
walked silently to the locker room at halftime with a towel over his blonde head. Seattle led 59-51 and won 117-106. Hodman finished with 13 rebounds in 32 minutes. 
The fans who made this just thp, second sellout ol' the sea­son made it obvious who thp,y were here lo sefl as they howled for everything Hodman did. 
Some had homemade signs, 
such as "Oh my God, it's 
Rodzilla" and "Welcome back 
Worm. We missed you, Go 
Mavs." Six shirtless teen­
agers wore goofy hats and 
wigs and had R-0-D-M-A-N 
spelled on their chests. Others 
painted their hair blue and 
green and a few had very 
fake-looking earrings and 
nose rings. 

This was easily the Mavs' 
most-anticipated home game 
since the Western Conference 
finals in 1988. The team 
issued more than 100 extra 
media credentials. forcing 
some of the overflow to be stashed in the hockey press box. Such attention is unheard of for a team that's last playoff win came before Rodman had his first tattoo. 
Rodman, though, was unfazed by it all, 
He shook hands with singer Montell Jordan during pregame warmups, then rocked nervously from side to side as .Jordan sang the national anthem. When Rodman was the first starter announced. he danced in place under a spotlight with­out even cracking a smile. 
Bodman got the evening off to a good note by showing up five minutes earlier than he had to, getting into the locker room at 6:10 p.m. even though his teammates had been at Reunion Arena for well over an hour. 
Rodman was all business as 
he collected several pairs of 
shoes and went straight to an 
off-limits workout room. 
That's when he found out he 
was in the starting lineup. 
"He's going to start eventu­
ally anyway, so we might as 
well throw him right in 
there," coach-genera! manag­
er Don Nelson said. 
Nelson laid out his first 
game plan of the Hodman Era 
to the other 11 players during 
a 5 p.m. shootaround and 
walkthrough. Shawn Bradley 
was the demoted starter and 
he didn't take it we!l. hurling 
a ball towards a rack then 
sulking against the hoop stan­
dard while the rest of the 
team simulated plays.

'Tin not sure." 

There is only one other phrase, probably, that I've spoken more often than 'Tm not sure," and it's, "I don't know." 
When 1was younger I thought that as I grew older, with more education and experience, I would have fewer and fewer occasions to use these phrases. And yet, as I have gained so much in the way of educa­tion and experience, I find myself using just such phrases all the more. 
Some years ago, a senior here at Notre Dame told the story that when she was a first year student she was pretty sure she wanted to be an attorney. She studied like a future Supreme Court justice, giving her­self entirely to that future goal. She even began to pick out law schools. As time passed, and with more education and experience, she became less certain. For various reasons, some which she didn't understand her­self, she grew less sure about being an attorney by the time her second semester senior year rolled around. When asked about what she was going to do after graduation some four short months away, she would say, "I don't know." This was difficult not only because she felt the need to be certain, but because she felt like she owed it to others, especially to her parents, to be certain, and to be successful. 
Although the story of Jesus tells us that what we do is important, it also tells us that how we do what we do is often more important. Jesus was somewhat of a wandering preacher and teacher who told people who seemed sure of what God wanted of them, and sure of an exact way to be saved, that perhaps they ought to think again. Jesus welcomed with love all people, especially those most brutally excluded by society. It was not just what Jesus did that revealed him as God, but how he did it. Christianity is first and foremost a way of living in the world. 
We are well into the second semester. At times it may seem like the pressure is on. There is that popular question, "What are you going to do?" Anxiety seems to go hand-in-hand with unsurety; and at this point in our lives we expect to grow in certainty, not uncertainty. Perhaps many of us, especially seniors in their final semester, are realiz­ing that when it comes to discerning a job choice or a career, 100% cer­tainty is at least unlikely and probably impossible. 
Maybe one of the most important benefits of education and expe­rience is a dispelling of the ways in which we are tempted to oversimpli­fy the complexities of life. There is something about dying and rising in all of this, a dying and rising which takes place during this life, and which we celebrate during the Lenten and Easter seasons. Hopefully, we die to old ways of seeing ourselves that were narrow and exact in order to continually rise to new ways of seeing ourselves and others; a dying and rising that allows us the freedom to change and appreciate the ability of others to change; a dying and rising that heightens our appreciation of the Paschal Mystery. Maybe we have to let go of that image of ourselves that is so sure of ourselves, and that seems not to need God. Perhaps this dying and rising calls us to be a little more comfortable with not being so sure all of the time, and not knowing everything there is to know, exactly. What else is faith for but to give us the surety to rest comfortably in the unsurety. I'd encourage you to take some time, perhaps on a retreat, to rest in the unknowing. Campus Ministry is sponsoring three Senior Retreats this semester; and the Center for Social Concerns and Campus Ministry are co-sponsoring a Senior Service Retreat. Call Campus Ministry or the CSC for more information. But hurry! They number of folks who are living the question are many! 
I don't need to say that what we do with our lives is important. Our choices can have a great impact on ourselves and on our world. However, maybe the question which should precede "What do I want to do?" is ''How do I want to be?" And maybe then our uncertainty can move us ever closer to the truth of our Jives, and of our faith; and ever closer to our God. Maybe the most important thing is not always what we do with our lives, but how we do it. Maybe it's time to rest, even revel, in the uncertainty, as a means by which we surrender our own wills to the will of our God. It's time to consider not so much what we do as the measure of our success, or how much money we make, or the sta­tus of our particular job or occupation; but rathe1~ to consider how we choose to live our lives in whatever we choose to do; and whether we have welcomed the surety of God into the unsurety of our lives.

Seles addresses women's glass ceiling 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
Speaking before congressional leaders and othE>r dignitaries to accept an award, Monica Soles was so nervous her voice cracked. 
A few minutes later, in casual conservation, she settled down enough to talk about her 1993 stabbing. 
Seles' ability to overcome adversity and return to the elite of her sport e1uned her the annual Flu Hyman Award. pre­sented Wednesday on National Girls and Women in Sports Day. 
"In a single moment, the script changed forever," HealLh and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said in present­ing the award. "She rewrote her own script." 
Seles is the 15th recipient of the honor. named after the Olympic volleyball player who died suddenly from a ruptured aorta in 1986. Seles joins Chris Evert, Billin Jean King and Martina Navratilova as the fourth tennL<; player honored. 
"It's very special," Seles said. 'Tm very fortunate to be playing a sport I love and make a fan­tastic living at it." 
Rep. Ted Stevens. R-Ala., referred to as the "Father of Title IX." received a special award for his contribution to women's sports. Title IX is a 1972 a federal law designed to equalize money spent on men's and women's sports. 
Stevens used the opportunity Wednesdav to make a case for a bill he's sponsoring that would require schools to provide each student at least one hour of physical education class per day. 
Seles. one of four women ten­
nis players to earn more than 
$10 million in prize money, was 
fortunate to play in one of the 
few women's sports that 
received widespread attention 
over the past few decades. 
However, she said she still plays 
under a glass ceiling.

"Definitely," she said. "There's still quite a difference in terms of our regular tour prize money and at the Grand Slams, too. The only Grand Slam that pro­vides equal prize money is Lhe 
U.S. Open. You train the same amount of hours, there's no dif­ference." 
Seles wa<; the No. 1 player in the world when she was stabbed during a changeover at a tour­nament in Hamburg. Germany. She stayed away from the WfA Tour for more than two years. but returned to become the tour's comeback player ol' Lhe year in 1995. She's currently ranked 13th in the world. 
"I think I've put it behind me, but it's always going to be brought up," Seles said. "And I think in life there are going to be more times that I'm going to have Lo go through adversity. You have to move on. It's such a gift to be here every single day." 
Seles, 26, acknowledged she is a more content person now than when she was a giggling teen­ager ruling her sport. 
"I was 16, 17, 18 at that time, and I was 19 when l got stabbed," Seles said. "So a lot of life experiences change and a· lot of your outlook on life. I still want to strive to be the best that I can be. As long I love to play, I think I will." 
Seles is recovering from a stress fracture of her right foot, but will return to the circuit in the State Farm Championships at Scottsdale, Ariz., later this month. It's unlikely she will ever be the dominant No. 1 again. especially with the wave of new. younger and stronger players such as Venus Williams. Serena Williams and Amelie Mauresmo on the rise. 
"All the women are getting stronger, and that's the future of women's tennis," Seles said. "I think as a player, you have to make those adjustments. All of us can be to a certain point strong. There's so much genet­ics and just nature that come into force. "

Wednesday night, pulled out of the tournament late Tuesday night with a lower back strain. 
"J wish I was feeling a lot bet­
tor. I wish I could play here," 
Agassi said at a news confer­
ence Wednesday night. "I can't 
afford to get held back by doing 
something stupid out there." 

Agassi has a chronic condi­tion in his back known as spondy!isthesis, which is when one of tho lower vertebrae is slightly forward of its normal position. About 2 percent of all people have sur.h a condition, though it's most common in pre-teens. 
Lenny Stein. the San Francisco chiropractor who treated Agassi, said it's unlikely tho world's No. 1 player will miss any action other than the Sybase Open. Agassi is not scheduled to play again until an event in Scottsdale, Ariz., beginning March 6. 
Stein said there were signs of inflammation in Agassi's lower back. but X-rays did not show any problem other than the spondylisthesis. 
Agassi flew to California from Zimbabwe. where altitude sick­ness and dehydration caused him to vomit into a courtside trash can while leading the L'nited States to a Davis Cup victory. The previous weekend, ho won the Australian Open. 
Since leaving his home in Las Vegas on Dec. 28, he has flown 25,780 miles. Now he's heading back to Las Vegas for rest. 
Agassi said he first strained his back in his Australian Open semifinal against Pete Sampras, and then aggravated it because he had to use more spin than normal on his shots in the altitude of Harare, Zimbabwe. It got worse on the 26-hour flight to San Francisco. 

"Playing here would have 
been by far a greater concern 
for me. Not only would I have 
not been at my best. but I would 
have subjected myself to real 
risk," Agassi said. "It's not easy 
to stay healthy 52 weeks of the 
year in tennis." 
The withdrawal of the top­
seeded Agassi left defending 
champion Mark Philippoussis as 
the top remaining seeded player 
at No. 2. Philippoussis, ranked 
17th in the world, was the only 
top 40 player left in the 
$350,000 tournament. 
Agassi had arrived in San Jose after a tough nine days of world travel. Ile won the Australian Open title on Jan. :,o in Melbourne, then flew to southern Africa to win two sin­gles matches for the U.S. Davis Cup team in its first-round vic­tory over Zimbabwe. 
He assured Sybase Open and ATP Tour officials Monday that he would be playing in the tour­n am cn t, which was to have been his first in the United States since winning the U.S. Open title last September. 
But Agassi called tournament director Barry MacKay after a practice session in San Francisco on Tuesday to say he was pulling out of the Sybase event. 
"He said he started getting cramps on the flight from Zimbabwe to London," MacKay said. "Then on the flight to San Francisco, it started to get worse. He tried to work out, but could barely move." 
It was at the 1998 Sybase Open that Agassi defeated No. 1 Sampras in the final, an early step in his comeback from being ranked as low as 141st in the world. Agassi has been No. 1 since winning the U.S. Open last September.

Massive blood clot triggered Thomas' heart attack 
Associated Prc:s. 
Derrick Thomas' legs weren't red or swollen and his body temperature was normal. 
There were no visible signs of a blood clot. doctors said Wednesday, But when Thomas was being moved from his hospital bed tu a wheelchair on his way to thera­py Tuesday morn­ing, something trig­gered a massive blood dot in his pulmonary artery that provides blood and oxyg<'n from the heart to the lungs. 
Thomas. :u. told his mother he wasn't feeling well just before his eyes rolled back, said Dr. Frank Eismont, an orthopedic surgeon at Jackson Memorial Hospital. 
The Chiefs star. who held the NFL record of seven sacks in a game, went into cardio-respiratory arrest. Thomas, paralyzed from the chest down in a car r.rash two weeks earlier. died minutes later. 
The cause of death, confirmed Wednesday by an autopsy. is common for paralysis victims. 
"A certain percentage of people with paralysis suffer from blood clots," said Dr. Barth Green. a neurosurgeon at Jackson Memorial Hospital. "Sometimes vou can see them and sometimes the.y're hidden in the deep­er veins of the body. and that's what happened with Derrick." 
Between 3 percent and 15 percent of spinal cord in,iury patients suffer from blood clots. Green said. 
Thomas was driving a car during a snowstorm on Jan. 23 as he and two 

friends headed to the Kansas Cit.y air­port to fly to St. Louis for the NFC championship game. Ile lost control of' thfl car. and it overturned several times, 
Police said Thomas was speeding and weaving in traffic, but no charges were filed. 
Thomas and passengnr Michael Tellis, 49, were not wearing seat bi>lts and were thrown from the car. Telli:i was killed and Thomas' spine and neck wer<: broken. The third person in the car was wearing a seat belt and received minor injuries, 
Thomas was brought to the hospital. i.n Miami. his homi>­town, whom he had surgery to repair his spinal column. 
The nine-time Pro Bowl line­backer had been on blood thin­ners since the accident, doc­tors said. Therapists also used mechanical devices on Thomas daily that inti>rmitti>ntly con­tracted his legs to help circu­late blood. 
"We took all the aggressive precautions that are available to people today," Green said. "It just wasn't enough." 
Added Eismont: "If I were to have it all to do over again, I wouldn't do anything differ­ent." 
Thomas had been progress­ing quickly in rehabilitation. He was allowed out of the hos­pital last weekend -although a nurse and a physician stayed with him -and he had been talking about returning to Kansas City within the next few months, said Dr. Jon Brown11. Chiefs team physi­r.ian. 
A news conference had been discussed that would have 
informed the public of Thomas· upcoming moves. 
Thomas left behind thousands of grieving !'ans and nearly as many rriends and relatives trying to cope with bis sudden death. lie will be remembered in both Kansas City, Mo .. and Miami within the next 10 days. 
Memorial services are set to begin in Kansas Ci.ty and then mov<' to Miami, Thomas' hometown and the plac,~ where he will be buried. 

Them will be a viewing Monday at Thomas' church in Kansas City, then a memorial service at Kemper Arena the following day, Chief's president Carl Peterson said. 
'Tm not sure it can hold all the peo­ple who want to attend," Peterson said. "It will be a public opportunity for Derrick's fans and friends to honor him."

All-American scored 12 of the team's first 19 points of the half, as the Irish led 54-43 at the 12;30 mark. 
"I thought midway through the second half we started playing our game," McGraw said. "We went into Ruth and I thought she responded well and came up big." 
At the 8;39 mark of the half. Danielle Green stepped to the line and calmly sank one of her free throws, for her l ,000th career point. She became the 16th player in Irish history to achieve the feat. 
"That was a great thing f'or Danielle," McGraw said. "She's had a tremendous year and especially lately. She's played so well in the last three or four weeks. She's showing a lot of leadership and doing a great job for us." 
After Kelley Siemon scored nine points in less than four minutes, the Irish led 73-51 with 4:18 remaining. 
Then came a four-minute stretch that McGraw would like to forget. 
Pittsburgh's pressure defense, their hot shooting and Notre Dame's poor bench play all added up to a wild finish. 
It started with a Wittenmyer shot from the post. as the Panthers scored eight straight. Notre Dame was still up by 15 with two minutes left, but Michelle Katkowski. Laine Selwyn and Brooke Stewart scored eleven points in less than a minute. 
A Stewart three-pointer from the left corner with 18 seconds left narrowed the lead to 80­
74. After a turnover. Selwyn had an open three from the top of the key. She missed. Green hit one of two free throws to seal the victory. 
"We were very tentative at that point," McGraw said of the final four minutes. "I think that's why teams think they can press us because they watch the ends of our game. From now on we're just not going to sub at that point which is unfortunate." 
After giving her players a couple days off to rest prior to last night's game, McGraw has reassessed her thinking. 
"That's the last time we'll take any extra days off," McGraw said. 
"I can't wait to get to practice [today]. I think we've got a lot of great ideas about how we can fix what happened tonight," she said. "I think we'll bring our track shoes tomor­row and get the kinks out that way."

Engelhardt leads Irish by leaping into record books 
By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN As~isranr Spores Editor 
High jumper Jen Engelhardt sprang to success at Notre Dame, making history with her lofty leaps. 
Engelhardt aims to win her third honor 
as an All­American. 
.. A I I ­
American status is great," Engelhardt said, "And I'd love to 

be blessed Engelhardt with that again. Becoming All-American. and then continuing to do iL junior year [is my greatest suc­cess]. That was rcallv reward­ing and something I never experted." This season. the senior biolo­gy and education major wants to win the third and fourth Big East titles of her career. "I want to lead the team in the Big East and have a strong finish. hopefully a champi­onship," Engelhardt said. Engelhardt won the Big East Outdoors Championships each of the past two years. She has never finished lower than sec­ond in the Big East, indoors or outdoors. Engelhardt achieved success through both talent and hard work. "She'll do anything you ask her," field events coach Scott Winsor said. "She's very con­
scientious. She works hard. and I think she puts in as much time as she's physically capable of. She's a pleasure to work with." 
Leading the Irish 
This year. Engelhardt serves as one of two captains for the Irish. a position that adds leadership responsibility to her role as a high scorer. 
"Just today, she said that she didn't think that some of the younger athletes on tho team really understood how impor­tant the Big East is," Winsor said. "And she was going to try to get that across to when we pick our captains," Winsor said. "Typically we try to pick someone who's very accomplished both athletically and academically." 
Going for gold 
The 2000 track season will not be the end of Engelhardt'::; career, not if shp, has anything to say about it. Instead of hanging up her track shoes fol­lowing graduation, Engelhardt plans to throw her efforts behind a possible run at the Olympics. 
"The Olympic Trials am right over the horizon," Engr.lhardt

Engelhardt said. "It's some­thing that I really treasure." 
Irish coaches selec.ted Engelhardt as captain for rea­sons beyond just athletics. Engelhardt has excelled in the classroom despite the rigor or being a varsity athlete with a double major in biology and education. 
"Obviously we take accom­plishments outside of track and field into consideration es are pretty 
responsive to 
letting me train after school lets out. The door's open. so I'm going to follow through on that." 
Qualifying for the Olympic Trials will require the best jumping of her career. Engelhardt will need to improve on her career best high jump of 6-0 3/4 by two to three inrhes to have a shot at Olympic glory.

If sheer will power can get her there, Ungelhardt will be a shoo-in. 
"She's extremely dedicated," head track and field coach Joe Piane said. "She's very talent­ed and a great competitor." 
Every competition this year has been chalked up as a vic­tory for Engelhardt, a trend she aims to continue this weekend at the Butler Invitational.

the No. 4 high school high jumper in tht~ nation as a senior at Lakeview High School in BattJp, Creek, Mich. But she wasn't even sure whether she wanted to concentrate on div­ing or high jumping. 
"Actually I was a diver. and that was my first option," Engelhardt said. "But I always had a love for high jumping, so I went that route." 
A lifelong fan of the Michigan Wolverines, her college choice came down to Michigan and Notre Dame. Once she zeroed in on Notrn Dame. she quickly had a deep impact on the Irish. 
As a freshman, Engelhardt became the first Notre Dame woman ever to earn All­American status in a field event, placing ninth at the NCAA indoor championships. 
"That really came as a shock for me," Engelhardt said. "I rcallv went after it. and I real­Iv W<)rked hard. Plus I have a great coach." 
She's been winning praise ever since. 
Engelhardt smashed Notre Dame's indoors school record her freshman year with a win­ning jump of 5-foot-10 3/4 at the Alex Wilson Invitational. That samp, season. she began her run of top finishes at the Big East Championships by taking second both indoors and outdoors. 
Despite the early accom­plishments, Engelhardt kept jumping higher and higher. setting a Notre Dame outdoors record with a leap of 6-0 3/4. 
lier junior season, Engelhardt made ht>r way to two NCAA championships. She took 12th at the indoors cham­pionships to be designated as an All-American for the second time in her career. At the NCAA outdoors champi­onships, Engelhardt turned around to place 19th. 
"She's improved a lot," Winsor said. "She jumped 5-10 in high school, and she's jumped 6-0 3/4. When you're at that level, three inches is quite a bit. You can work years for a one-inch improvement."

IRISH INSIGHT 
Irish are lucky to escape with victory 
Call it th£! luck of the Irish. 
When the Irish stepped on thP. c:ourt Wf'dncsday night against conference rival Pittsburgh. tht>y didn't look like the No. 5 team in lhf' nation. 
Suffering through their worst display of 
Kerry Smith 

basketball all season, the Irish just edged out assistant the H-8 sports editor 
Panthers with a 
81-74 finish. 
The Irish wen~ lucky they weren't playing ConnPc:licut. fl.utgers or Boston Colleiw. 
Thcv Wf'rl! luckv no NCM scouts were ~t lhe .loyr/Cent<~r trying to det'idr. what teams should host thP opening rounds come tournument time. 
And th<'V were luckv that the 
eighth-ranked team in the ronferenre 
wasn't on top of' its game enough to 
pull a major upirnt. 
''I'd likP to apologize to our fans and anvonf, ~vho had to sit th rough thal g11:nw b<)UUS<' we didn't play lo our abilitios,'' said Irish hDad coach MutTt'l Md;raw. "For that I apologize and our tPam apologizes. IL was the mosl cmba:.rnssing performance of the season. 
When a team breaks a school 
r1cord for most consecutive wins with 
iLs 16th straight victory and one of its 
senior starters etrhes her name into 
the record books with her 1.000th 
point, it should be a Lime for cr.lebra­
tion. 
But for sPnior guard Danielle Grnen 
and tlw Irish. brokPn records wr.re 
nwt with broktn spirit~ as tlw Irish 
rPalized thP road to tlw NCAA tour­nament is going to be an uphill battle. 
"We had a lot of problems," said McGraw. "Definitely the mf'ntal part, the lack of focus. the lack of intensity, thfl lack of pride and thP. lack of any basketball knowledge whatsoever were all key factors." 
The Irish showed Wednesday that they are not as infallible as they have appeared since their winning streak began in December. ThP-y hit a low point by letting a team that lost to Connectieut by 52 points come within seven points of an upset. 
The Irish were plagued by turnovers and a non-existent inside game in the first half. Handing the ball over to the Panthers 12 times, the Irish were unable to stir,k to their usual game plan and high standards. 
Despite their height advantage under the net, the Irish couldn't con­vert in the lane. After five missed shots in the first twu minutes, Mr,Graw had to go to the to replace center Ruth Riley and forward Julie Henderson. 
"I folt uur post didn't r,ome to play mentally," said McGraw. "When you'rn looking insidfl and you can't convert. then you have to make a change." 
Hiley finished out the half with one field goal and five points. Henderson added only two. 
"Missing shots like that makes you frustrated," said fl.iley. "We should have been making those shots. I think a lot of people stopped looking for their shots after they missed a few ­that hurt us." 
Luckily for the Irish. Big East co­rookie of the week Alicia Ratay was on tirn from behind the arc. Ratav hit four 3-pointers in a row to make-up l'or the poor play under the basket,

scoring 14 points in the first half. pro­pelling her squad to a six-point :,3-27 halftime lead. 
"That was the only reason we were winning at halftime," said McGraw of Ratay's sharp shooting. 
That lead was rut to just three in the opening second of the second half before the Irish picked up the tempo a notch. 
Realizing that their undefeated con­ference record was being seriously tested for the tirst time all season, Riley and forward Kelley Siemon turned up the intensity. They com­bined for 25 second-half points, lead­ing the lrish to a 73-51 lead with 4:18 remaining.1m the clock. 
But the win was anything but safe, as McGraw gave her starters a rest and the Irish bench squandered a 22· point lead in less than four minutes. When the Panthers began to use the press to gain possession of the ball, they whittled the Irish lead to just six with 20 seconds left in regulation. 
'Tm not pleased at all with the bench. And that's an understate­ment," said McGraw. "We're just not going to sub at that point which is unfortunate." 
The lrish have enough talent to pro­pel them to the Final Four in Marrh, but only if they play with that talent for the full 40 minutes. 
With the toughest stretch of their schedule on the horizon with road trips to Rutgers and Connecticut in the coming weeks. the Irish can't afford to falter again. 
And McGraw knows just how to ensure that. 
I'm not sure if [the Irish perfor­mance] opened their eyes our not but I have a feeling that tomorrow's prac­tice will be more eye opening than today's game," said the head r,oach. "I think w<'ll bring our track shoes tomorrow and get the kinks out that way."

NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL 
Maryland upsets Duke in Cameron 
Associated Press 
, DURHAM, N.C. The streaks for No. 3 Duke are over. and at the hands of an unlikely opponent. 
The 23rd-ranked Maryland Terrapins had lost 28 of their last 33 against the Blue Devils, but got 31 points from Juan Dixon and two key 3-pointers late by Terence Morris in a 98-87 victory Wednesday night, snapping Duke's record 31-game Atlantic Coast Conference winning streak. 
Duke (18-3, 9-1) also had the nation's longest winning streak snapped at 18 and lost in Cameron Indoor Stadium for the first time since Jan. 11, 1997, against Wake Forest -a span of 46 games. 
Dixon's point total matched a career high, while Lonny Baxter added 22 points and Morris had 20 as the Terrapins (17-6, 6-4) tied North Carolina for second place in the ACC. 
The game was tied 83-83 when Morris, who had struggled all night and allowed 28 points to Shane Battier on defense, hit a baseline 3-pointer with 3:27 left to give Maryland the lead or good. A minute later, he made another shot from beyond the arr, and the upset was brewing. 
Dixon helped close it out with three fouls shots over the final 31 seconds as the Terrapins outscored Duke 15-4 down the stretch. 
Morris finished 7-of-22 from the field. 
Neither team led by more than seven points until the final two minutes in arguably the best ACC game of the year. 
Duke made 13 of its first 17 shots, but unlike most of its wins during the Cameron streak, the Blue Devils couldn't knock out their opponent, turning the ball over 12 times in the opening 20 minutes. 
The Terrapins trailed 33-26 before going on an 11-0 run behind six points from Baxter, who had 14 in a fast-par,ed first half in which both teams shot at least 50 percent.

WOMEN'S SWIMMING AND DIVING 

-
Belles host conference championships in peak form 
... 
.. 
I 
I r 
By NOREEN GILLESPIE 
S,unt M.1ry's l:.dicor 
After two years of provi­
sonarv membership in thP 
'.\11AA.' thr Saint Mary's swim­
ming and diving team opened 
their season rPady to makP a 
statement. 
· Pressing Alma and Calvin 
College to harder victories than 
expectPd during Uie rngular 
season, defeating a surprised 
Univrrsity of Chicago at its sea­
son opener and busting three 
school records, it's safe to say 
their voice has been heard. 
And the sr:rnaming is just 
about to begin. 
Closing their season this 
weekend with a home court 
advantage at thP first ever 
championship Pvcnt Lo be host­
ed by Saint Mary's, there is no 
question in any team mPmber's 
mind that this will be yet 
another statemi>nt made by the 
team. 
''This makes a huge state­
ment about how serious we art> 
in athletirs." f'irst-yPar head 
coaf'h Gretchen Hildebrandt 
said. "We want the MIAA to see 
we·re moving forward, and this 
can really bring a name to 
Saint Mary's." 
Outside of the championship 
hype. the women arP focused 
and readv to swim. 
"Thesi women are ready," 
Hildebrandt said. "\Vf~'ve talked 
a lot in prartir.e about this 
being a no-pressure situation. 
When thesP women get bPhind 
the blocks. behind their lane. 
thev will own that rar.e. Thev're 
not going to have to wc;rry 
about anything else." 
While the team will certainly 
face close encounters with 
Alma and Calvin College this 
weekend, Hildebrant has 
focused her swimmers on per­
sonal performance. not in team 
standings, she said. 
'Tm not pitting my swimmers 
against the other teams. caku­
lating points here and there," 
Hildebrandt said. "We're not 
readv for that as a team. What 
I want them to feel is confident. · and like they're enjoying them­
selves in the water." 
The focus, Hi!dPbrandt 
emphasized. is on swimmers' 
personal performanres. 
"I want them to be concerned 
with their own race," she said. 
"w,,·re not readv to start dral­
ing with points h~,rr." 
Hm-vever. losing two meets by 
less than l 5 points is a far,tor 
weighing un the women's 
minds. as the opportunity Lo 
rome out on top surfacns again, said co-captain Mirhelle Samreta. 
'Td say that our primary goal is for personal best times and staying unified," Samreta said. "but the team can def'inilely chase the competition. It's defi­nitPly a thought in our minds. We arnn·t just out for personal bP-sts here. Wt\ do know that we have a chance of beating out these other teams." 
For a tt>am that started its season under more than its share or turmoil. surmounling hPavy roster changes and tran­sitioning to a new coach. the mental toughness developed throughout the season will play a critir,al role in the weekend's championship. Throughout the season, the team's montal capacity has been a ronsistent strength. Hildebrandt said. 
"When I tell them to go a time in prar:tice, they'll go that time in pra<'tice." shr said. "They have an excellent balance of mental toughness and physical fitness. These are m1ntally Lough swimmers." 
Samrrta agrrnd. 
"Mentally, we·n~ very 011 top of our game." slrn said. "We've been training physically and mentally. and we're rna:dy to 
go." 
Evidence of that mental preparation has been exhibit11d throughout the past seV11ral dual nrnets, with the women posting season and career bests during thP peak of their train­ing, virtually unheard of in the late months of thr season. 
Coming into the linal stretch. that is not expected to change. 
"They're still going to swim fast," Hildebrandt said. "They don't have anything to worry about." 
Having erased three records to date this season. several records are also going to come under fire this weekend. possi­bly giving the 1999-2000 team some historical fame in the books. 
Junior sprinter Colleen Sullivan and sophomore sprint­er Danielle Clayton will go head to head against the 1999 50 freestyle record. which Clayton broke in the 1999 champi­onships. The pair could also knock on the door of th(\ 100 freestyle rPcord, uncontested sinr.e 1994. 
Samrnta, who has rn-st't her 1()() breastroke rnrnrd twice in her collr.giatt career. is also expectt>d to put her record on the line in her final rnllegiate meet.

Ding-dong lhe witch is dead. 
Enthusiasm swept campus late Monday night as Domers heard of the irnpimding resigna­tion of reviled athletic director Mike Wadsworth. 
The often­elusive tnith is. however, that Mike Wadsworth wasn'L a bad athletic direr.tor. 
lie was the victim of bad timing, a few verv visible, bad dedsions and an industry that thrives on results. Would he have taken the fall had the football team gone 10-2 instead of 5-7? Would relatively minor infractions (oh wait, they c:alled them major) and a mod­est probation hit the Domers as hard if WP were winning'? 
This was the business in which Wadsworth works and was thP story of his tenurP undPr the Dome. He was plagued by failures in Notrn Dame's two most visible sports -football and men's basket­ball. And he's judged by these failures. 
Never mind that Wadsworth helped to establish Notre Dame as a school of all-around athletic excellence rather than just foot­ball achievement. Under Wadsworth, non-revenue sporL'i became rnspP.cted nation wide. 
Notre DamP won a national championship in women's soc­cer; the women's basketball team becamP. the force it is today. The men's and women's 

-
fencing teams finished four 
straight years as NCAA runner­ups. and Notre Dame has 
enjoyed success in a multitude 
of other sports. 
But unfortunately for Wadsworth, f'enr.in'g isn't on television everv week and women's socrer doesn't have a contract wilh NBC. Volleyball doesn't pay the bills. 
For each fenr,ing success there was a football failure. For every Matt Doherty he hired. there was a Bob Davie. For every John !'vfacl.eod, hP per­suaded to resign, tl1ere was a Lou Holtz he was perceived to have persuaded.

Irish survive home scare from Panthers 
The Irish started the ganrn with an 11-2 advantage in the first five minutes behind Alicia Ratay's two 3­pointers. Notre Dame cooled off quir,kly though, as they managed to hit only 41 percent of their first half' attempLc;. 
"Missing shots like that makes vou frustrated," center huth Hiley said. "We should have been making those shots. I thi11k a lot of people stopp1xl looking for their  shots after they missed a fr.w-that hurt us." 
Notrn Dame expanded thr l1rnd to 1 :1 hut Pittsburgh's Amanda Wittenmy1ir srored nine points in thP last two minutes of the half to rut the Irish margin to 33­27. 
About the only positive for the Irish in the first half was Hatay. The 5­foot-11 forward, the Big East's co-Hookie of the Week, connected on 5 of 9 field goals, including !'our from ~-point range to lead thn Irish with 14 points at intrrmission. 
"That was the only reason we were winning at halftimr," McGraw said, rnf'erring to Hatay's shooting. 
At halftime, McGraw made some adjustments. including implementing a full-court press and emphasizing getting the ball to her post players. 
Bi!ev was the main rer,ipicnt of the new strategy. The 6-foot-5

Belles fall to Britons without Matha's aid 
By KATIE McVOY Sporrs Wrirer 
The Saint Mary's basketball team looked Lo overcome the odds and defeat Albion College, despite the injuries and illnesses that plagued the Belies during this week's praclices. Britons 71 
Unfortunately, 
Belles 63
the odds did not prove wrong, The lfolles lost to the Britons 71-63. 
Before thn game, Saint Mary's was concerned that the illnesses and injuries it suf­fored this week during practice would negatively affect its per­!'urmanr,e against Albion. Saint Marv's came into the game without starting forward Kristen Matha who has been out with a log injury since last Saturday's contest against Calvin College . 
Earlier this week. Matha had been givrn thP go-ahead to play in the game by the team doctor. 
Due to fear of a blood clot, however. Matha was unable to play al'tcr all. Coach Dave Hoeder used a different starting line-up without Matha. 

Junior Julie Norman and sophomore Kelly Jones started at the forward positions, sophomore Kelly Hoberts start­ed at the center position, and Mary Campione and Jamie Stouffer took their places as guards. 
.. It always hurts the team when vou're down a player," Hoberts said. "But other team members really stepped up tonight and played hard." 
During last Tuesday's game, Roberts was hit in the hrad with a ball, resulting in a con­cussion. She had also been given the go-ahead to play.
