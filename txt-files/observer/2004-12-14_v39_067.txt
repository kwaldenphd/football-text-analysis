Weis here to win 
'My job here is to raise [the] expectations.' 
By HEATHER VAN HOEGARDEN News Writer 
When he was unemployed 15 years ago, a job as the Notre Dame head football coach was the farthest thing from his mind. But Sunday, things came full circle for Charlie Weis, as he was named the head football coach at his alma mater, sign­ing a six-year deal. 
"This is obviously a high-pro­file. big-time job, but it's one that I, a long, long time ago thought 'wouldn't that be some­thing if you could ever be the head coach at Notre Dame,"' Weis, a 1978 Notre Dame grad­uate who didn't play football for the Irish, said at Monday's press conference. "You know when we all grow up we have aspirations." 
Weis, was without a job in 1989 after South Carolina coach Joe Morrison died, and as a result, he lost his assistant job. lie then became a high school head coach for a year before coaching in the NFL. The last five years, Weis has been the ofl'onsive coordinator of the New England Patriots, winning two Super Bowl titles. 
";\t the University of Notre Dame, the success in our foot­ball program consists of three things-acting with integrity, giving our students a superb education and excelling on the field," University President­elect Father John Jenkins said. "Meeting all of these goals is a tremendous challenge. But I believe we have found a person in Charlie Weis who can lead us to such multifaceted success." 
Weis said he didn't come to Notre Dame to lose football games. He expects nothing less than winning football games in a program that hasn't posted back-to-back winning seasons since 1997 and 1998 under Bob Davie. 
"You are what you are folks, right now you're a 6-5 football team," Weis said. "And guess what --that's just not good enough. That's not good enough for you, and it's certainly not going to be good enough for me. 
"So if you think they hired me to go .500, you've got the wrong guy." 
Weis especially emphasized the new attitude he wants to bring to Notre Dame. He knows the Irish play a tough schedule, playing four of the first five games on road next season, including Michigan and Pittsburgh. But despite claims that the schedule is too tough, Weis wants his team to play with arrogance, a sense that

Monk clarifies retnarks, supports Weis 

By MATT LOZAR News Writer 
After expressing public embarrassment last week about the decision to fire Tyrone Willingham, University President Father Edward Malloy explained his attention-grabbing n~marks Monday and offered his support for Charlie Weis. 
"I was not a definitive voice and I was not the one who initiatnd the action. The impression had been gained that I was, and I was simply trying to clarify the record that I wasn't and had a disagreement about that choice," Malloy said. "But people of goodwill can disagree about such mat­tnrs. and I don't want that to stand in the way of good rela­tionship with coach Weis." 
During the course of the football season, Malloy met with Irish athletic director Kevin White on many occasions to diseuss the direction of the program. Malloy felt the University had chosen Willingham as its coach and barring tragic events that coach should have a time span that is gnnerally five years. 
Malloy made his comments at the panel titled "Role of the President or Chancellor in Overseeing Intercollegiate ;\thletics"· at the Sports Business Journal's Intercollegiate Athletics Forum. He was on the panel along with presi­dents from Ohio State and Vanderbilt and Myles Brand, president of the NCAA. 
In June 2001, the Knight Commission published "A Call to Action: Heconnecting College Sports and Higher Education." Monday, Malloy cited one of the report's princi­ples that states the responsibility and authority for the administration of the athletics department are vested in the president. This includes issues related to basic policies, pnrsonnel and finances. 
"I was in a long-established commitment for a confer­ence in New York," Malloy said. "The other people that worn on it were all people I know. The things we talked about were all serious. 
"I knew I was probably going to be asked and was nxpncting that. I wanted to darify my position, which I felt I

did, and I have nothing else to say about that." 
During this presidential transition process, long-term decisions like a football coaching change affect both the current and future administrations. Malloy deferred to University President-elect Father John Jenkins at this time, following University President Emeritus Theodore Hesburgh's example. 
"I feel in the administration here we have a very harmo­nious group," Malloy said. "The transition has gone well with Father Jenkins, and I have talked about all the signifi­cant matters along the way and when I pass along the mantle. I have great confidence in the job he'll do and all the people who assist him." 
After the turmoil during the past two weeks, Jenkins feels Notre Dame is "absolutely" ready to put all of the criti­cism bnhind it and move on. He said Notre Dame is ready to put it in the rearview mirror and move forward.

White outlines extensive search 
By MATT LOZAR News Writer 

Notre Dame athletic director Kevin White claims he doesn't know any of the details about the nationwide media speculation surrounding the Irish coaching search. 
He didn't ready any of the articles. 
"''ve had the blinders on. I haven't read any of your articles. I really haven't. I'm sure some of them were terrific and some weren't very good. I can't speak to that," White said. "What I can tell you is my focus has been on hiring the next foot­ball coach. I worked really hard not to be defo­cused by everything that's going on." 
Over the 10-day search, White said Monday there were an unquantifiable number of conversa­tions with potential prospects in the college and NFL worlds. The University utilized one outside search consultant, Gene Corrigan, a former Notre Dame athletic director and former commissioner of the Atlantic Coast Conference. 
White said five candidates were interviewed for­mally for the head coach position left vacant by the Nov. 30 firing of Tyrone Willingham. 
Two candid a tes had conversations with University representatives about specific compen­sation details. 
On Friday, a number of different groups talked by phone with coach Charlie Weis before the offer was made that evening. 
The student-athlete transition team of Victor Abiamiri, Anthony Fasano, Brady Quinn, Brandon Hoyte, Justin Tuck and Ryan Harris talked with

Students voice optimism about Weis 
By CLAIRE HEININGER 
News Editor 

If first impressions are any indication, new head football coach Charlie Weis and the Notre Dame student body will make a strong match. 
Whether or not they favored the firing of former coach Tyrone Willingham, most stu­dents were optimistic Monday about the football program's chance to leave behind the con­troversy of the past two weeks and move forward under its new leader. 
"IWeis] seems like he's a foot­ball guy-he's going to put a system in place, relate to the players," sophomore Adam I Iiggins said. "I don't think any­one disliked !Willingham! as a man, but he wasn't getting it done as a football coach. I think IWeisl will." 
Senior Nick Moller agreed that from a purely football standpoint, Weis seemed to be an improvement on his prede­cessor -but should be held to an identical standard of per­li>rmance.

"When we didn't get [Meyer], I started to be against !firing Willingham] because I didn't want us to get our second choice again [after the 2001 George O'Leary episode!," sophomore Robbie Hhinesmith said. "But Charlie Weis seems

they can beat anyone they play. 
"Doesn't make any difference whatnver night or day they schedule them -we play them," Weis said. "That includes being able to win on the road, and it goes back to having that toughness and playing smart and playing disciplined and playing nasty and going in there with an arrogant attitude. 
"Doesn't make any difference where you go, you intend on beating them." 
Weis will now have to balance his time between Notre Dame and New England. The Patriots' season could last until the Super Bowl on Feb. 6. He would not disclose specifics about how he will split time, but he said he is confi­dent in his ability to recruit, even while holding both jobs. 
"One of the initial things we are going to have to do is get a foundation of a coaching staff that's in-house, on-site, that while there's some going back and forth between places of which schedule I won't talk about, I could have a foundation set," said Weis, who also said he will not be attending the Insight Bowl. 
Weis, the first Notre Dame graduate to be a head coach at the University since Hugh Devore served as interim coach in 1963, said his knowledge of Notre Dame will serve to his advantage. 
"Well, when you go talk to_ a guy about coming to school here, it isn't like you don't know," Weis said. "If you try to recruit a guy-I know, I've been here." 
In the meantime, Weis said he will focus his attention on the current Irish players. 
"I come here with a plan, and the plan is [that] the first thing you've got to do is you've go to take care of the guys you already have here," he said. "Everyone wants to hear about recruits, but they forget about the players that are already here." 
For Weis, after he is finished with New England's season, Notre Dame is the end of the road. 
"I also owe the New England Patriots and the people from New England to give them my best until their season is over, because once their season is over, my NFL career is over and I'm the head coach of the University of Notre Dame full time until the day I retire, and that's what my intent is," Weis said.

"He's going to come in strong and not take less than the b1~st from the players," Sergio said. "Not that he'll boss them around and be a super bad guy, but get it done on and oil' the field." 
Players loved Willingham, Sergio said, but the former coach did not accumulatn the on-field record Notre Dame requirns. 
"I Firing Willingham I was kind of a necessary step to get us where the Univnrsity wants to go with the football pro­gram," he said. "But "[Willingham I did some great things oil' the liPid and I really respect him for all that he did." 
In the eyes of senior Sarah Wallace, it will be diflicult for Weis to immediately achieve the same level of n~spect. 
"I think !Willingham! was a more likeable pnrson to watch talk, so unless this new coach puts out a lot of wins, he's not going to compete with me," Wallace said. "It seems like the pnople in charge are willing to hurt a lot of feelings and put winning before everything else." 
Sergio disagreed. 
"It's not necessarily all about winning," he said. "But both sides !of athletics and academ­ics! have to be considered ... and from what I saw it looks like Weis can take care of both."

Concerns still retnain in Irish cotntn unity 
By CLAIRE HEININGER 
News Editor 
Despite the hiring of Charlie Weis, some nwrnbers of tlw Notre Dame eommunity who voc~ally oppos1Hl the firing of Tyrone Willingham said Monday that thnir concerns still linger. 
Paula I Iiggins, a musk professor who initially sponsornd tlw Faculty Senate's Dec. 6 resolution against the liring, said on the face of it, Willingham's dismissal still appcmrs to be the wrong choice. I ler shock at the decision's abruptness and exclusivity -not to mnntion the negative external attcmtion it brought the University -has yet to f~tde. 
"This is our University," said Higgins, who observed a dra­matic increase in academic performance among the football players she taught during Willingham's tenure. "!The firing! seemed to suggest that winning is more important than aca­demics. After all, Notre Dame is not the NFL-even though some people want it to be." 
But the fact that Weis is an NFL eoach does not necessarily speak for his academic credentials, !Iiggins acknowledged. 
"He's a Domer, he knows the drill," she said ofthe 1978 grad­uate. "One would hope he understands the importance of aca­demics at this University ... I think he deserves all of our sup­port." 
Though he stood front and center at the Weis announcement, Faculty Board on Athlnties chair Fernand Dutile said afterward he stood by the board's Friday statnment about its concerns over Willingham's termination. The statement listed speed, tim­ing, a lack of faculty involvement and the role of two members of the Board of Trustees as the faculty board's chief concerns about the decision. 
The statement also asked University President Father Edward Malloy and University President Elect Father John Jenkins to meet with the board. Both have agreed to do so, and will hold separate meetings because of scheduling reasons, Dutile said. 
However, Dutile expressed satisfaction with his inclusion in the hiring process. 
"I was continually involved in the search," he said. "I talked to [Weis] personally about the academic concerns of my job ... in my view, he represents commitment to integrity, academic success and athletic success." 
Tim Kelley, a 1964 Notre Dame graduate who helped author a letter to the Board of Trustees last winter that criticized· the University's management of the football program, echoed Dutile's endorsement. 
"It appears there was a fairly well-managed selection process as opposed to what happened in the past," Kelley said. 
Kelley refused to take credit for influencing the coaching change, but said. other alumni he had spoken with were pleased with Weis' Notre Dame ties. 
"He's a Notre Dame graduate and he understands the issues ... I think he is probably in a better position than past coaehes to do it the Notre Dame way," Kelley said. "He's one of us." 
That mentality is troubling to !Iiggins, who said thn University's eore academic and athletic values are jeopardized by outside pressures-alumni included.

Since thnn, Notre Damn either has-n 't played in a bowl game (see 1996,1999,2001, 2003)or hasn't won a bowl game (see 1994, 1995, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2002). No Notre Dame team sinee 1993 has ended a win­ning season with a sijo,Tflifieant victory. Changing that trend would give the team some momentum heading into the off-season. 


Either way, a win would be a positive means of They've seen Bob Davie, then George O'Leary, then Willingham and now Weis as the head coach.

sidelines. Oregon State, if you don't remember, embarrassed Notre Dame in the 2001 Fiesta Bowl, creaming the Irish 41-9. This season's senior elass has­n't forgotten that blowout. J\ win against the Beavers eould make the previous loss hurt a little less.

path to victo­ry in the Insight Bowl. 

So there it is, a few reasons why Notre Dame does have something to play for on Dec. 
28. Sure, the Insight Bowl isn't the Fiesta, Rose, Orange or Sugar Bowl. It's not even the Gator or Cotton for that mat­ter. 
But it is a bowl game. It does give Notre Dame a chance to win a football game. To end its season with a mueh-needed victory. To give the Weis era a little momen­tum heading into the new 
coach's first season in 2005. 
The Irish are what they are at this point in the season ­an inconsistent 6-5 team that has shown flashes of great­ness, and flashes of inepti­tude. For all the difficulties this season has presented, Notre Dame can push the neg­atives away and foeus on end­ing the season on a high note. 
With the Irish falling so rap­idly from college football's elite programs during the last decade, it's eritieal to begin turning the program around. Lou Holtz's 1996 team fin­ished the season at 8-3, and turned down bowl bid invita­tions. Things certainly have changed since then. 
But with Weis stepping in, the program can begin to regain some prominence. While a win in the Insight Bowl wouldn't be, by any means, groundbreaking, it could be the start of a slow, gradual improvement of the Irish football program. 
Does this game even mat­ter? 
Yes, it does.

"Anytime you get an oppor­tunity it's a chance to show­case what you've got," Goolsby said. "It's going to be a big­time game with a lot of guys watching. That's one way I want to look at it. But at the same time I want to win it for coach [Willingham] and for the younger guys so there's more than enough reasons to pre­pare well." 
Budinscak, another fifth­year senior, said that for the seniors, it is a chance to show the world one last time what they can do. 
"Obviously this thing might mean a lot more to us than it does to people around the pro­gram who are concerned with a lot of other things," Budinscak said. "I think we would love to as seniors go out and play the best game we've ever played, and try to amaze people with what we can do and have a great team effort. We want to go out on the right note." 
And while the seniors play their last game for Notre Dame, other Irish players will be playing their first bowl game. Walker, a true fresh­man, is excited for the oppor­tunity to play in a bowl. 
"It's very exciting," Walker said. "Seeing all the bowl games on TV last year, that was something I really wanted to do. I'm excited, I'm thrilled. I'm pumped-up, ready to go. I just can't wait to get to Arizona where it's warm."

QUARTERBACKS 
Quinn has been up and down during the regular season, but has still had the best year of his career so far after throwing for 2,372 yards and 15 touchdowns. He has also shown flashes of being able to bring the ball down and run if the defense allows it. 
Anderson has had a fan­tastic year, throwing for 3,257 yards and 25 touchdowns. Both Quinn and Anderson completed 53 percent of their pass­es this season, but Anderson had 470 attempts to Quinn's 324 attempts_

IRISH RUSHING 
The Irish have done well this season with a two­headed attack in senior Hyan Grant and fresh­man Darius Walker. The two backs were about all the offense the Irish could muster against USC, and Oregon State's run defense is not as good as USC's.

BEAVER RUSHING 
Notre Dame's rush defense is ranked No. 9 in the nation. averaging just 94.4 yards allowed per game. The Irish have held opponents under 100 yards eight times this season, but only won four of those games. 
Oregon State has gone from one of the best rushing teams in the nation with Stephen .Jackson in 2003, to the second-worst in the nation in 2004 at just 
75.3 yards per game. Its passing game more than makes up for the lack of a rushing game. 
The Beavers will prol:]a­bly lose this battle b~y. However, the Irish have still lost plenty of gap:r,~s", this year in which they:~ stopped their opponents',; running games, so Oregon State might n()t;; be too worried if tliti'y can't run against ithe Notre Dame defense. 
BEAVER PASSING 
The Irish secondary has been one of the worst in the country, allowing five touchdowns in each of Notre Dame's last two games in the regular season. The team's aver­age of 274.3 yards allowed through the air per game is the fourth­worst in the nation. 
Anderson is not a stellar quarterback, but neither was Pittsburgh's Tyler Palko, who threw for 334 yards and five touch­downs against the Irish. Anderson is the leader of the nation's eighth-best passing attack, averaging 
304.4 yards per game.

Notre Dame hasn't won a bowl game since 1994, and lost its last two games during the regu­lar season. They'd love to break both those streaks at the Insight Bowl, and help Baer go out a winner -no doubt with the team playing in honor of Williingham.

Mattison to join Meyer's UF staff after bowl 
Current Irish defensive line coach will be Gators' co-defensive coordinator

Irish dnfensive linn coach (;rng Mattison simply eouldn't take another eoaching change.

''I'm rnally excited about it. I'm nxcitnd about ]Meyer]," Mattison said Friday. "Wn'vn always rllally n1spneted each othnr. I think the world or him and tlw job he's done and I'm exdtml about being thorn." 
Mattison was the dnf'nnsive coordinator for all fivn years of f'ormnr Irish eoach Bob Davie's tnnurn. Whnn Tyronn Willingham carnn to South Bnnd in 2002, Mattison was the lonn holdover from Davin's starr and has benn the defen­sive linn coach for thn past thrnn snasons.

I said I don't know if I want to go through that whole thing again." 
Mattison is known as one of' Notre Damn's top recruiters 
over the past eight years. The challenge of recruiting at Notre Dame is the lack of a local tal­ent base. While the allure of playing for the Irish is an advantage, the countrywide search is a hindrance. 
At Florida, that won't be the case. 
"For the past eight years, I've bnfHl on a plane it seems like evory othnr day flying all over tho country," Mattison said. IMnynrl said, 'How are you going to like getting in your ear, driving to son a kid at

Oregon State happy to be in any bowl game 
No.4 California's BCS snub drops Beavers from Sun Bowl to Insight Bowl 

By PAT LEONARD 
Associate Sports Editor 
No. 4 California was poised to take a BCS bid to the Rose Bowl. Then, it happened. 
The Golden Bears got snubbed in favor of No. 6 Texas. Their drop in the bowl picture rippled throughout the Pac-10 conference, and the stage was set. 
Notre Dame (6-5) would play Oregon State (6-5), not UCLA, in the Insight Bowl Dec. 28 in Phoenix. 
"There's going to be a lot said about how this all transpired," fourth-year Oregon State head coach Mike Riley said. "I really Dame 41-9 in the last postsea­son meeting between the two teams at the 2001 Fiesta Bowl. 
This time, the Beavers again bring a high-octane passing attack characteristic of Pac-1 0 teams against a Notre Dame secondary that has allowed 10 passing touchdowns in its last two games. 
Quarterback Derek Anderson leads the Beaver offense that averages 304 yards passing and 7 4 yards rushing per game. Anderson kept Oregon State close against No. 1 USC in a 28­20 loss, the same team that beat Notre Dame 41-10.

Anderson helped Oregon State rebound from a 1-4 start. The Beavers played four ranked teams in their first five games, losing to Boise State, Arizona State, California and Louisiana State, a 22-21 season-opening loss in which kicker Alexis Serna missed three extra points. 
Hiley's team bounced back to win on the road against Washington, Arizona and Stanford, and a season-ending 50-21 victory over in-state rival Oregon clinched the Beaver bowl berth. 
Oregon State defensive end Bill Swancutt (6-foot-4, 259­pounds) anchors the Beavers line and has the second-highest sack total (11.5) and third-most tackles for a loss (18.5) in the conference. Swancutt was announced as the 2004 Morris Trophy winner recen.tly, an award given to an offensive and defensive lineman each season as voted by the players on oppo­nents' starting lines. 
Anderson and Swancutt are both seniors and looking to close their careers out with a win Dec. 28. 
"I think the Sun Bowl was attractive. I think Notre Dame and the Insight Bowl are attrac­tive to our team," Hiley said. "Just like all of us coaches, I think the players were excited just to learn where and who they wanted us to play."

Baer decides not to pursue Utah State job 
By MATT LOZAR 
Sports Writer 
The way Irish interim head coach Kent Baer explained the Utah State situation showed how diflicult a decision it was. 
Baer's parents live five min­utes from the campus. His son, granddaughter and four sisters livn there as well. He played college football for the Aggies and coached there for nine years. 
But for Baer to take a head eoaeh position, it had to be about more than personal con­nnetions. 
"Aftnr looking at the situation. my emotional heart and my pnrsonal heart was into it beeausn that's where I'm from," B;wr said. "But my professional hnart just didn't seem like the right thing for me to do right now. I'd love to be a head coach someday. I want to make sure it's tho right situation. I d(m 't want to be a head coach just to be a head c£mch. So, again, it was just a gut feeling." 
Baer wasn't satisfied when the school couldn't commit to futuro plans concerning upgrades to the locker room, menting rooms and weight room. 
When the school asked Baer if we would accept the job if it was offered, he said no. 
Baer met with Utah State in Arizona the second time after meeting them in Los Angeles on the first go-around. 
Utah State announced Brent Guy as its new head coach Friday. Beavers a streaking team 
After a l-4 start, the Beavers have won five of their last six games to become bowl-eligible after defeating Oregon 50-21 on Nov. 20 in the annual 'Civil War" game between the two teams. 
The hot finish to the season reminds Baer of the 1996 Stanford team that won its final four regular season games before defeating Michigan State 38-0 in the Sun Bowl. 
"[They'veI won four out of the last five or five out of the last six. So, we might be playing one of the hottest teams in the country. We're playing a team that's pretty hungry," Baer said. "They're really a talented foot­ball team and we're going to have our hands full. 
It's going to be a challenge. Our guys are excited to play them." 
The impressive statistic about Oregon State's five losses ­LSU, Boise State, Arizona State, California and USC -is those all came against teams current­ly ranked in the Associated Press top 2 5 and all five are playing in bowl games. 
Parish continues to practice at cornerback 
After making his starting debut at cornerback against Southern California Nov. 27, Freddie Parish will continue to see time at the cornerback posi­tion in bowl practice as well as get repetitions at his customary safety position. 
"Freddie did an excellent job for us that day. It's really just a tough situation to get him in, get him all the looks," Baer said. "But I thought for the most part, he did a great job. I know they gave us some looks, especially in the passing game that he hadn't seen, that we hadn't practiced. I thought for the most part he did well." 
Baer wouldn't say whether Parish would get his second start of the season at corner in the bowl game. Team hopes to get players healthy for bowl 
Baer didn't have a lengthy injury update list on Friday. He said defensive end Justin Tuck should be okay and that Maurice Stovall, who has been battling an ankle injury this season, should be fine once the Irish get to Phoenix. 
Coming out of the USC game, the Irish had some players beat up. Baer said he will hold some back in practice so they're ready for Oregon State. Practice schedule 
Baer said the Irish will prac­tice today, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday before the players go home for a few days. 
The team will reconvene· in Phoenix on Dec. 22.

"Obviously one of the two greatest influences of my life in the coaching profession is Bill Parcells," Weis said. "I mean, he took me, gave me an opportu­nity whflll I was an absolute nobody, himd me and groomed me, and started me on spPcial teams and then I moved to off{msc." 
Weis coached the Giants' running backs for two years before moving to New England, where he coached run­ning backs, tight ends and wide receivers filr the Patriots from 1993-96. Weis thnn went to the New York Jets, where he made his debut at ofl'ensive coordinator in 1998. In 2000, he returned to New England as Bill Belichick's offensive coordinator, pick­ing up two more Supc1· Bowl titles.

"I look at those guys, those gentlemen who I have been able to be groomed under and be polished under and learned how to deal with the game of football and teaching of football and dealing with all of the different ele­ments and the distractions, and get focused on what's really important," Weis said. 
Family is important to Weis and his wife, Maura, who have two children, Charlie and Hannah. In 2003, Weis and Maura started the Hannah & Friends Foundation for children and young adults affected by autism and global delays. Weis' daughter Hannah is affected by these developmental disor­ders. 
Maura and Charlie attended Weis' press conference where he announced his acceptance ofthe Notre Dame job.

Weis knows nasty is needed 

It stuck out like the diamond-filled ring that weighs down his right hand. 
In the middle of his lengthy opening state­ment, new Notre Dame football coach Charlie Weis described what his team would be. 
Hard working-Weis knows first-hand 
championship football teams aren't made by going through the motions. 
Intelligent-at Notre Dame, Weis already has an advantage. 
Nasty-wait a second. "And I hate to include the nasty, but that is part of 


being a winning football  
team," Weis explained.  Matt Lozar  
After three years ofpolit­ically correct Tyrone  Sports Writer  
Willingham always having  

the right answer to every question, Weis opened some eyes at his first press confer­ence. 
One common theory in replacing a leader is to go for the opposite of the person being replaced. 
Weis isn't the exact opposite of Willingham. Both understand the first and foremost responsibility of the coach at Notre Dame is to win and win often. That's why a new coach was announced Monday. 
But Willingham never talked about his team being nasty. Having a swagger, yes. Being nasty, no. 
There is a difference. 
Weis comes from the Bill Parcells and Bill Belichick coaching pedigree. Knowing any­thing about those two top-flight coaches reveals they are no-nonsense kind of people who don't make excuses for anything. 
Parcells throws his rookies into the fire and chastises them when they ask for a play off. Just ask Julius Jones how well that's worked. 
Belichick won't acknowledge injuries as an excuse in New England this year. The Patriots have been forced him into using wide receiver Troy Brown as a defensive back. By the way, the Patriots are 12-1. 
Weis refused to make excuses Monday about the academic standards for recruiting, the challenging schedule and juggling act he 'II have to perform holding two jobs for what many hope is until Feb. 6 in the winning lock­er room at Super Bowl XXXIX. 
The players really didn't know what to think upon hearing Weis' nasty comment during the press conference. 
They remember an offensive coordinator from the Super Bowl champions as something more than just a run-of-the-mill guest speaker during a winter practice. He criticized them and after that initial shock, the players real­ized this guy knows what he is talking about. 
Hearing the nasty comment Monday morn­ing provided another eye-opener for the play­ers. 
But they let it sink in again. 
And they liked it. 
Just ask Justin Tuck and Brady Quinn. 
After meeting with Weis Monday afternoon for the second time in as many days, the two leaders left the Joyce Center with a bounce in their step and smiles on their faces. 
It didn't matter that it was finals week. 
It didn't matter that it was a winter wonder­land in South Bend. 
It didn't matter that Tuck has all the tempta­tion in the world to declare a year early for the NFL draft. 
They wanted to strap on the pads right there. 
Why? 
They know that nasty wins. 
Just look at Weis' right hand.

Players respond positively to Weis hire 


By JOE HETTLER Sports Writer 
Brady Quinn looked like a kid on Christmas morning Monday. 
The Irish signal-caller was all sm i Ins a few moments after Notre Dame named New England Patriots offensive coor­dinator Charlie Weis its 28th football head coach at a morning press confenmce. 
"Everybody is real excited," Quinn said. "We didn't get to meet as a team and talk about it. but you can tell tlwre's a lot of excitement and happiness that, one. tlw whole search is over ­we know where we are -and secondly !aboutI the person we have." 
Aflnr ptwsomtlly meeting with Weis around 9 p.m. Sunday evening, it didn't take Quinn long to form an opinion of his now coach. 
"Maybe live minutes," <)uinn 
-

said, still grinning, "because he got right down to it. He started talking about himself and what he's all about and right then he had my attention. I'm just happy he's here." 
Although the entire team did­n't speak with Weis before he was hired, many players had already met the 1978 Notre Dame graduate. Weis spoke to the Irish during winter workouts last year, and Tuck remembers the speech as anything but typi­cal. 
"llon<~stly, he was the first guest speaker that wasn't hip hip hooray Notre Dame," Irish defensive end Justin Tuek said. "lie was more of a critieal guest speaker. That was kind of sur­prising. lie was the first speaker to eome in and really get on us about things. 
"We were like 'You're the guest speaker, you're supposed to eome and say how great Notre Dame is and blah blah blah.' It was a different twist. That was our frrst impression of him." 
Tuek said Weis may even have insulted some of the players dur­ing his speeeh. . 
"I think some took a little offense to it," Tuek said. "But then they sat down thought about it and he was right." 
Irish tight end Anthony Fasano believes Weis will help Notre Dame have a different attitude on and ofl'the field. 
"I think lan attitude ehange was needed J. Going 6-5, you have to change something," Fasano said. "I think that's a big part of football, and I think he's going to bring it to our team." 
Tuck said he liked what Weis said in the press conference, speeifieally when the new eoach referred to Notre Dame as being "a nasty" team under his leader­ship. 
"When he said that, I aetually started laughing because I've never heard someone at a press conference say 'nasty,"' Tuek said. "But that's a good thing beeause football is a nasty game, and you want that attitude eom­ing from the top person and fil­tering down to the team." 
Perhaps the biggest benefactor of the Weis hiring is the Irish offense, speeifieally Quinn. Weis has developed New England's former sixth-round pick, Tom Brady, into a twq-time Super Bowl MVP, while leading the Patriots to wins in two of the last three Super Bowls. 
''I'm pumped up," Quinn said. "Honestly, going to the press conference, hearing him talk and watching the JNew England! game [Sunday!, it only brings excitement to me, and I just ean't wait to get out there and get my head in the playbook." 
As for Tuek, Notre Dame's all­time sack leader has one year remaining of eligibility remain­ing, and he said he's still waiting to deeide whether to go into the NFL or stay in South Bend. 
"That's going through my head right now," Tuck said. "From the little I know about [Weis) and lis­tening to him at the press con­ference, he seems like ... some­body you can really like as a head coach." 
Quinn said one of the most important critnrions that Weis will bring Notre Dame's football program is confidence. With so many accolades to his name, no one doubts Weis' ability to help a team find success. 
"It impresses me. It gives me a sense of confidence in him because he knows what it takes to get there," Quinn said. "lie's coaching guys, he's had success and he's winning Super Bowllsl. It's only going to help us, to give us more confidence and inevitably buy into his program and his system."

David Bruton, a safety from Miamisburg, Ohio, wasn't as thrilled as Sharpley but still felt Notre Dame made a good choice . 
"It's a step in the right diree­tion," Bruton said. "I still don't know much about him or how he coaches or his personality or any­thing likn that." 
When eontael!~d none of the recruits said Weis had talknd to them. llowever. both Sharpley and Smith indicated that they were expeding a eall from Weis some­time Monday night. 
''I'm looking forward to that call," Sharpley said. 
Sharplny, who carries a 3.97 CPA, phoned a number of players who have already givnn their ver­bal cornmitmenl<; to the Irish and other potential rocruil'i after Wnis was hirnd.

It was a 27-year journey from student seetion to sidelines for Charlie Weis. 
Starting in New Jersey, stop­ping off in South Carolina and winding through New England, Weis has eome home to end his eareer as Notre Dame football's new head eoach. 
'This is obviously a high-pro­lile, big-time job," Weis said. "But it's one that I, a long, long time ago thought -'wouldn't that be something if you could nver be the head eoaeh at University of Notre Dame."' 
Weis picked up three Super Bowl rings on his way home to the Dome and is the first Notre Dame alumnus to coaeh the Irish sinee II ugh Devore served as interim eoach in 1963. 
Dr. Jim Benenati, Weis' room­mate !'rom his days as a resident of Flanner 2B, rnealled Weis as a "warm and caring" person. Benenati recalled sitting and cheering at football games with Weis. However, at the time Benenati never imagined his roommate standing where Dan Devine then patrolled. 
"I never put it past him, !but] I would be lying if' I thought back when we were in school that he'd ever be the Notrn Dame lilotball eoach," Bennnati said. "I don't think that ever even crossed my mind, but I never put anything past him in terms of ending up back at the school in some mpac­ity."
