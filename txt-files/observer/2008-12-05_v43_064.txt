Hall hosts Christn1as celebration 
Carroll's annual event spreads holiday cheer 
By LIZ O'DONNELL News Writer 
Students. faculty and com­munity members will gather outside Carroll Hall tonight 
for  the  11th  annual  "A  
Carroll  Christmas,"  the  
dorm's signature event.  

"[The goal of this event is] to spread Christmas cheer by singing loud and clear for all to hear," Carroll Hall presi­dent Kevin Jakopchek said. 
With the organizers of "A Carroll Christmas" anticipat­ing the largest crowd ever, the event's budget was increased 50 percent this year, from $2,000 to $3,000. 
Among the reasons for the increase· in budget was the addition of a heated tent on the Carroll lawn. 
"Due to ever expanding attendance we needed to add a heated tent for more space," Jakopchek said. 
The ceremony includes the blessing and lighting of Carroll's Christmas tree, along with a five-song set by the a capella group Big Yellow Taxi. 
Following the outside por­tion of the evening, atten­dees are invited into the dorm to partake in more fes­tivities.

INSIDE COLUMN 


To Chevy, vvith love 
I got the news Thursday morning that 
one of the longest relationships of my 
life was coming to an end. 
A friend sent me the link to the 
Washington Post article, and my heart 
sank as I read of your imminent end. 
Your own Web site had no such 
announcement, and 
I wonder if the pain 
Kaltlynn Rielly 

is too overwhelm­
ing for you to 
announce yourself 
Assistant News 

that you are leaving 
Editor 

me. The article said 
you could not com­
ment. 
The Post's headline -"Capitol One to 
buy local banking icon Chevy Chase" ­
broke my heart. 
Times are tough, I know, but I thought 
you were going to be okay. When other 
banks around the country failed, you 
seemed to remain resolute. I trusted my 
money with you. I knew you would keep 
it safe. 
But I read that you are unable to sur­
vive the current financial crisis, and 
that within the first three months of 
next year, Capitol One will buy you, for 
a sum of $520 million in cash and stock, 
acquiring the 250 branches that have 
bordered the highways and byways of 
my youth. 
I read that your branches will be 
"rechristened under the Capitol One 
logo." But I'll always remember your 
beautiful brick buildings, your white­
columned porticos, your large red signs 
and your plentiful ATMs. 
And I'll never forget our good times 
together. 
The first time I was aware of the con­
cept of banking was at one of your 
branches. My Girl Scout troop was given 
a tour, and we all received little Chevy 
Chase duffel bags. I used mine for 
sleepovers and soccer practices until it 
was worn. 
Growing up, I placed every check I received, for birthdays, for graduations, for First Communion, in my Chevy Chase Bank savings account. Per my parent's rules, I could not take the money out until I went to college, but you kept it safe and my money grew, if only a little, with interest. 
My friend's mom worked for you when I was younger, and one time, she took us to see an Orioles game from your box seats. Those were the days. 
The summer before I left for college, I opened a checking account, and received my first Chevy Chase Bank check card. You've watched as I've turned in different paychecks from dif­ferent jobs. You let me withdraw money from ATMs when I studied abroad, with no extra fee. 
And this summer, when my check card was close to expiring and I was afraid I would not receive my new card before I left to return to school. I called you, nervous. You told me you would send it to me right away, and two days later, I received my brand new card in the mail. 
I didn't know at the time it would be the last new Chevy Chase Bank card I'd ever receive. 
After I learned that Capitol One would soon buy my beloved bank, I opened my wallet. What's in my wallet? 
My Chevy Chase Bank check card.

Chrisbnas program helps those in need 
By ALICIA SMITH News Writer 
Students and faculty members, as well as clubs and organizations at Saint Mary's, can "adopt" a fami­ly or an individual as part of the program and purchase Christmas gifts for them as part of the College's 12 Days of Christmas. 
During the 12 days, participants also rai'ie money to donate to their families. 
The program, run by the Office for Civil and Social Engagement (OCSE), began on Dec. 1 and will continue until Dec. 12. 
"We adopted 15 families and 15 individuals." Carrie Call. director of the OCSE, said. "Usually, we take about this number because we've found it's manageable given the nwnber of people at Saint Mary's College involved and the amount of money we can raise. " 
This year, the College adopted more families than usual. Call said, in order to "try and alleviate some of the pressing need that local agencies are experiencing due to the poor economy." 
Families were chosen from the Salvation Army. the College's part­ner Title 1 schools and an organi­zation called Grandparents as Parents. Some individuals came from Mental Health America and REAL Services. 
Throughout the event, the OCSE is hosting multiple fundraising functions. Each residence hall will participate in a fundraising event called Penny Wars. Candy grams, T-shirts and mugs are also being sold during the 12 days. On Dec. 12, the College will hold a Craft Show and Sale, which will also ben­efit those in need. 
Although the program promotes helping ihese families during the holiday season, there are also other events on the schedule, Call said. 
"The event is not meant to be just about gift giving. It's also meant to be an educational time to learn about traditions like Posadas and Kwanza and to engage in opportu­nities for spiritual reflection," she said. 
Each day there will be a different event that takes place at the College, such as a holiday dinner where children and residents from the Center for the Homeless will join the students for a meal. Other events include ornament decorat­ing, vespers services, card decorat­ing, bell ringing for the Salvation Army, gingerbread house making and a cookie decorating party.

Madrigaldinner to beheld at College 
Choir hosts three-night event, renaissance themed performances 
By MANDl STIRONE News Writer 
This weekend, the Saint Mary's Madrigal choir, along with students, staff. faculty and community volunteers, will host the 36th annual Madrigal Christmas Dinner. 
The three-night event fea­tures four separate renais­sance-themed performances and meal productions, said the Leighton Chair of Music and director of the Madrigal choir Dr. Nancy Menk. 
While the event originally showcased a co-ed choir for two matinee and two evening shows, the program switched over to an all-women choir about four years ago due to trouble finding male volun­teers, Menk said. 
The 24-member Madrigal choir is composed by Saint Mary's students at all levels and in various fields of study, she said. 
There are also student and faculty servers, actors, trum­pet players and crew, she said. 

Other participants, like the Andrews University Early Music Ensemble, who are playing the part of The Royal Consort, come from outside of Saint Mary's, Menk said. 
The menu for the dinner, provided by Saint Mary's/Sodexho Dining Services, consists of roast beef au jus at the evening showings, and stuffed Cornish game hen at the matinees. 
There are also roasted potatoes, glazed carrots, a winter salad and bread. 
In addition to the adult courses, last year, a chil­dren's menu and children's ticket price of $15 was intro­duced. 
"Now they have chicken fin­gers," Menk said. 
The new menu and ticket option were implemented to try and draw more children to the event, Menk said. 
"Kids love it," she said. 
Though this is the 36th appearance of the dinner at Saint Mary's, it is Menk's 25th performance. 
Menk said she enjoys per­forming, but her favorite part 
of the dinner is when the boar's head is brought out. 
The traditional song that is sung during this, The Boar's Head Carol, had to be arranged differently after the choir became all-women, she said, so she asked a composer from Alaska, Grant Cochran. to modify a four-part male arrangement to a four-part female arrangement for the choir. 
"It's always fun to watch the people's faces as we pass the boar's head around on a platter," Menk said, "It's a really traditional part of any Madrigal dinner." 
The Madrigal Christmas Dinner has become an impor­tant part of the Christmas celebration for many South Bend residents, Menk added. Some people bring office groups to the dinner, while others make it a family tradi­tion, she said. 
"There are people who make it a part of their annual holiday traditions," she said.

Prime minister closes government 
OTTAWA -Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper shut down Parliament on Thursday in an unprecedented attempt to keep his government in power, fending off a no-con­fidence vote he was all but certain to lose. 
Less than two months after winning re-elec­tion, Harper successfully asked the unelected representative of the head of state for the power to close down Parliament until Jan. 26, hoping to buy enough time to develop a stimu­lus package that could prop up the economy. 
"Today's decision will give us an opportunity -I'm talking about all the parties -to focus on the economy and work together," Harper said after the private meeting. 
Governor General Michaelle Jean, who rep­resents Britain's Queen Elizabeth II as head of state, granted the unusual request to suspend parliament. 1\ad she refused, Harper would have had two choices: step down or face a no­confidence vote Monday he was sure to lose. 
Cholera epidemic strikes Zimbabwe 
HARARE, Zimbabwe -Zimbabwe declared a national emergency over a cholera epidemic and the collapse of its health care system, and state media reported Thursday the government is seeking more international help to pay for food and drugs to combat the crisis. 
The failure of the southern African nation's health care system is one of the most devastating effects of the country's overall economic col­lapse. 
Facing the highest inflation in the world, Zimbabweans are struggling just to eat and find clean drinking water. The United Nations says the number of suspected cholera cases in Zimbabwe since August has climbed above 12,600, with 570 deaths, because of a lack of water treatment and broken sewage pipes.

ALBEHT LEA, Minn. -Two teenage girls who worked at a nursing home have been charged with abuse, accused of taunting, spit­ting on and groping the breasts and genitals of residents who suffered from Alzheimer's dis­ease and other dementia disorders. 
According to the criminal complaint, filed Monday, 19-year-old Brianna Broitzman and 18-year-old Ashton Larson laughed earlier this year as they spat in residents' mouths, poked and grabbed them, and at times mocked them until they screamed. 
Broitzman and Larson, who worked as part­time aides at the home, have been charged as adults. 
No one answered the phone Thursday morning at Broitzman's home. There was no information in court records on attorneys for either teen.

An involuntary manslaughter conviction carries a maximum 20-year prison sentence and $1,000 fine. The term could be five years or less for someone with no prior convictions. 
Fleury and the club also were indicted on four counts each of furnishing a machine gun to a minor. A conviction on each count is punishable by up to 10 years in prison, up to $10,000 in fines and the loss of a firearms license for at least 10 years. 
Bennett said prosecutors know of at least four chil­dren, including Christopher, who fired automatic weapons at the fair. He her gave the Uzi to Christopher or any chil­dren, and weren't in the immediate area when the accident happened. 
"The club is disappointed by the indictment," he said. "The club's intention is to plead not guilty and the club denies they participat­ed in any criminal act." 
Fleury, Guiffre and Spano did not immediately return calls for comment. 
The machine gun shoot drew hundreds of people to the sporting club's 375-acre compound. An advertise­ment said it would include machine gun demonstra­tions and rentals and free handgun lessons. 
"It's all legal & fun -No permits or licenses required!!!!" reads the ad, posted on the club's Web site. 
"You will be accompanied to the firing line with a Certified Instructor to guide you. But You Are In Control -"FULL AUTO ROCK & ROLL," the ad said. 
The ad also said children under 16 would be admit­ted free, and both adults and children were offered free .22-caliber pistol and rifle shooting. 
Christopher's father was 10 feet behind him and reaching for his camera when the child fired the weapon. 
IRAQ 



Two soldiers killed by suicide bombs 
Associated Press 
BAGHDAD -Suicide bombers killed 17 people -including two American soldiers -and wounded more than 100 in a string of blasts in two Iraqi cities Thursday as a timetable for withdrawing all U.S. troops won final government approval. 
The brazen attacks in areas where the U.S. military has struggled for years to maintain order raised ques­tions about Iraq's ability to ensure its own security as the U.S. scales down its own combat role under the newly ratified U.S.-Iraqi security pact, which calls for an American withdrawal within three years. 
Iraq's three-member presidential council signed off on the pact Thursday, removing the last legal bar­rier so that the agreement can take effect Jan. 1. 
But the latest bombings underscore the fragility of Iraq's recent security gains, adding new urgency to U.S. efforts to train and equip an Iraqi security force capable of maintaining order after American troops have gone home. 
The two Americans were killed when a suicide driver detonated an explosive-laden car near an Iraqi checkpoint in the northern city of Mosul, military spokesman Lt. Col. Dave Doherty said. Iraqi police said eight people were wounded, most of them civilians. 
But the deadliest attacks occurred in Fallujah, the country's most heavily guarded city and once the symbol of Sunni Arab resistance to the U.S. occu­pation. 
Truck bombers struck within min­utes of each other outside the concrete barriers surrounding two police sta­tions in different parts of the city, killing 15 people, wounding more than 100 and shattering nearby buildings, police and hospital oflicials said. 
An al-Qaida front group, the Islamic State of Iraq, purportedly claimed responsibility for the attack in a state­ment posted on a militant Web site.

IN BRIEF 
Banks borrow less, finns borrow more 
WASHINGTON -Commercial banks bor­rowed slightly less from the Federal Reserve's emergency lending program over the past week, while investment firms stepped up their loans. 
The Fed's report, released Thursday, showed commercial banks averaged $90.3 billion in daily borrowing over the week ending Wednesday. That was down from $93.6 billion in average daily borrowing logged over the week ended Nov. 26. 
Investment firms drew $57.2 billion over the past week. That was up from an average of $52.4 billion the previous week. This category was recently broadened to include any loans that were made to the U.S. and London-based broker-dealer subsidiaries of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch. 
The Fed report also showed that its net holdings of "commercial paper" averaged $297.6 billion over the week ending Wednesday, an increase of $15.4 billion from the previous week. Under the first of its kind program started Oct. 27, the Fed is buying mounds of the crucial short-term debt that companies use to pay everyday expenses. The Fed has said about $1.3 trillion worth of com­mercial paper would qualify. 
Market wary of employment report 
NEW YORK -A period of relative calm on Wall Street ended Thursday as stocks tum­bled in the final hour of trading on growing investor anxiety ahead of the government's November employment report. 
The major indexes each slid more than 
2.5 percent, including the Dow Jones indus­trial average, which dropped 216 points after rising in seven of the last eight ses­sions. 
Investors are worried that Friday's employment report would show a further deterioration in the job market; employers have already cut 1.2 million jobs in the first 10 months of the year. leaving the unem­ployment rate at a 14-year high of 6.5 per­eent. Economists expect the Labor Department will report that the jobless rate rose to 6.S pcrc~ent in November and that companies eut another 320.000 jobs. 
Amidstrecession, AT&T cuts 12,000 jobs 
Telecom giant to lose 4 percent of workforce as it loses traditional customers 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK-Pressured by the economic turmoil and the mounting loss of tradi­tional phone customers, AT&T Inc. is cutting 12,000 jobs, about 4 percent of its workforce. 
The Dallas-based telecom­munications company, the nation's largest, said the job cuts will begin this month and run throughout 2009. The company also plans to lower its capital spending next year, and .one analyst estimates that reduction could be as much as $2 bil­lion.

The new cuts were part of a parade of layoffs tied to the recession.

Keeping Weis the right move 
After back-to-hack disappointing seasons, Notre Dame ath­letic director Jack Swarbrick and University President Fr. John Jenkins decided to retain Charlie Weis as the head foot­ball coach. And they made the right call doing so. 
The University has had its name dragged through the mud over the last five years regarding its treatment of Weis, espe­cially after the early !iring of Tyrone Willingham (the first coach not to finish live years as coach since Hunk Anderson from 1931-1933). The athletic department is returning to the stability it had before Willingham's dismissal, thereby avoiding OnH:

Editorial 
these are things that take time. Whoever was the coach of the Irish the last two seasons would have dealt with thesn issues; it just happened that Weis was the one who did. 
Also, college coaching is only half what you arc doing this season on the field; the other half is how you are preparing for the future with recruiting. And, according national recruiting Web sites like Scout.com and Hivals.com, Weis and his staff have been among the elite rccruitnrs since his 
arrival at South Bend. 
Some have argued that with these great recruit­
ing classes, there should have been a better prod­
One of the biggest criticisms from the media has been a racial one, that Willingham was fired because he is black and Weis was kept because he is white. The different treatment of the two men has nothing to do with their skin color, but with their abilities. Willingham was a mediocre coach and inept recruiter with Notre Dame's prestige, money and facilities behind him. He has shown his inability to produce on the field at Washington, resigning midway through a winless season. 
Wcis has shown some competence as a college football coach, though certainly not as much as what had been expected. While this past season has been subpar according to Notre Dame's high standards for the football program, the team did show signs of improvement. The offense did not rank dead last in total offense and the defense continued to grow under the tutelage of defensive coordinator Corwin Brown. 
There are still some holes left to be fixed (such as the offensive line and establishing a solid running game), but since he did not become coach until late in the 
process that year). With some already beginning to shine -such as Michael Floyd and Ethan Johnson -and many others waiting in the wings, Weis should be able to produce a much better team next year -comprised mostly of his recruits. 
But the most important reason, and one that many are drastically overlooking, is the monetary issue. Weis' buyout, whether it is $5 million or $20 million (the two extremes reported), is money that should not be spent with the econo­my in the state it is today. With Jenkins pushing every department in the University to be more frugal to save money and jobs, spending $20 million to fire ono coach and spending the additional money it would take to hire anothor would be exorbitant and hypocritical. 
By keeping Weis, the University recommitted itself to sta­bility in the football program and its own stated economic policies, while still setting up the football program for a bright future.

were more concerned with our football team than with the game that was hap­pening at that moment. 
One week, and one more loss in the Ugly column later, and coach Weis was in a meeting with Athletic Director Swarbrick. The meeting, apparently, was not to stop the bleeding but to give Coach Weis more bandages to fix this conun­drum. The two have now devised a plan for how to bring Notre Dame football back to the place that the alums expect it to be, competing for National Championships. With his decision to retain Coach Weis, the blame for what happens next sits on Athletic Director Swarbrick's shoulders just as much as it sits on Weis'. Because of this, I have to ask Mr. Swarbrick one question: Do you feel lucky? Well, do ya? 
While the student body might be mixed over whether or not Coach Weis should have been retained, it seems that most of the Alums and ALL of the media believed Weis was a dead man walking in the Coliseum last Saturday. In rolling the dice Mr. Swarbrick has figuratively got into bed with the Coach that promised to bring us hard-working, intelligent, nasty football team. He has inextricably tied his perception amongst the alums and possi­bly his future at this University to how successful a group of 19 and 20-year-old boys perform on the field next year. 
As for Coach Weis, he has to fmd a way to take the Ugly out of this school's foot­ball program. One place he can start is by holding back the arrogance and being a little more humble. If his contract truly is as large as we have been meant to believe in recent weeks, he would cer­tainly have the funds to give us seniors a refund for all of the emotional trouble we have been put through. Sixty thousand dollars can refund us all for what we saw as our last game in the student section, and I think it would be a small price to pay for some good will with the soon-to­be young alums. I think most of the sen­iors would join with me in sending the money right back to Hannah and Friends, and we would all be better off for it. 
At the very least, I think the senior class deserves an apology from the coach. On Oct. 15, 2005 we as fans were taken to the highest of heights, only to be let down again, and again, and again in the ensuing three years. We've witnessed the worst two years of Notre Dame foot­ball, after unreasonable expectations were set for us early on. I don't know if the Notre Dame family needs to lower its expectations of our football team. I don't know if the world has passed our pro­gram by, but what I do know is that it has been one hell of a four years, and I'll always remember the good times more than the bad and ugly ones.

The Killers' first two albums, "Hot Fuss" and "Sam's Town," were so well­done that the band surely set itself up to go nowhere but down.

Many may remember Grammy nomi­nen Sara Bareilles' appearance at Legend's Nightclub in Fall 2007 before her suecessful emergence on the popular musie seene. Others may have seen her in her 200S Summer Tour with Counting Crows and Maroon 5. Either way, seeing Sara Bareilles live is not an experience easily forgotten. Perhaps unfortunately of The Killers' previous efforts. The album as a whole, however, is quite a disappointment. The pop punk band attempts to be experimental by mixing contrasting genres and instead ends up sounding not like The Killers that we 
all know and love, but rather like a rip-off of other bands. 
The opening track, "Losing Touch" would be an excellent and innovative new pop song if it did-n't sound like it belonged on a 1970s Eric Clapton album. Rather than simply drawing influences from classic and glam rock, the band relies on its influences without

pigeonholed by her hit "Love Song," nominated for Song of the Year at this year's Grammy's, Bareilles' real staying power will come from her appealing live performances. 
Clearly, not everyone can make it to a Sara Bareilles concert. But luckily, her most recent release, "Between the Lines: Sara Bareilles Live at the Fillmore" brings her live talent to personal music libraries everywhere for people who don't have the fortunate opportunity to catch a performance. A nice substitute

for a live viewing, Bareilles' new album is definitely worth a listen. Ultimately, her recorded performance is a relaxing, stimulating, and enjoyable experience that, just like her concert, will stay with listeners. 
Most people probably recognize Bareilles from her radio-smash, "Love Song." Though her success with "Love Song" is unde­niable, its potential to stick monotonous vocals, a lack of emotion, an almost unsurprising likeness to U2 and an absence of the edge found in "Sam's Town." "I Can't Stay" flops thanks to its annoying use of a Caribbean beat, harp, and saxophone in the background and inane lyrics. One would not exaggerate to say that this song truly belongs at a Hawaiian luau-themed party in a bingo parlor. 
"Neon Tiger" sounds mysteriously similar to MGMT, the indie rock band that broke out earlier this year with their single "Time to 
ity, although it does lack the confusing instrumentation and bafning combina­tions of musical genres that mark other songs. 
"A Dustland Fairytale," on the other hand, is a pleasant surprise. Certainly, the track starts out slow and follows the same format as many classic rock songs. But the music quickly gains momentum and you can feel the emo­tion in Flowers' vocals, reminding one of "Read My Mind" from "Sam's Town." The impassion11d ballad also has amazing lyrics,

Flowers also mentioned in the Quietus interview that with the album's second single "Spaceman," "I was look­ing for a mixture between [David Bowie's] 'Space Oddity' and [Elton John's] 'Rocket Man."' 
As with most of the other tracks on the album, the quality of "Spaceman" hardly makes up for its lack of original-
Bareilles with a one-hit-wonder status is unfortunate. "Love Song" is not the only track equipped with potential radio suc­cess, and overall, all of Bareilles' music is lovable. While "Love Song"· is undoubtedly a current feel good main­stay, it is just a small glimpse into Bareilles' true talent. 
With the soulfulness of Norah Jones, the edgy angst of Feist, the pop catchi­ness of Gavin DeGraw, and a lyrical tal­ent akin to Jason Mraz, Sara Bareilles is the perfect storm of soul, jazz, and pop­rock. Her voice has a distinct jazzy tone that is tempered with its pop appeal. With a good mix of jazzy. up-beat tracks and mellow, relaxed musings, she offers a wide range of emotions in a variety of sounds. The lyrics are intelligent and still relatable, dealing with romance, fame, and the changes life brings. Bareilles meets the daunting task of hav­ing a mature musical approach that maintains the novel touch of youth. 
Bareilles' quips and comments throughout her performance are mini­mal. The few lengthier comments are excused with self-effacing humor. Still, body needs you?" 
Sure, the Nevada-based band was clearly trying to avoid catering to the American population's musical inter­ests on "Day & Age." And it's excellent that The Killers are exploring different sounds rather than relying on the same sound for every album. However, the band simply went in the wrong direc­tion this time. Let's hope for a better one the next time around.

the commentary is a nice peak into the artist's personality, which comes across as casual, sweet, and unpretentious. Otherwise, the commentary doesn't pro­vide deep information about her work on the whole; rather it serves to do little besides humanize the music. 
Her ability to write endearing lyrics and couple them with simple, fun accompaniment is a huge strength. But, overall, it is her charming live quality that separates her from other contempo­rary artists. Though she's often put under the umbrella genre of pop music, she has an atypical talent for d11livering a compelling live performance. Enhanced with pitch-perfect vocals, a consistent jazzy twang, this is music that is hard not to like. "Between the Lines: Sara Bareilles Live at the Fillmore" is an easy listen and also stimulating. With the holidays fast approaching, it would be a great stocking stuffer but is good enough that it could also pass as an out­and-out Christmas gift as well.

Weekend should give fans glimpse of the future 
Tlw last time l rnmnmber being this exdted was the 1999 World Cup-that was my Super Bowl. my Olympics. I'm pretty sure the College Cup will feel the sanw for any 12-year old girl thorn this weekend. 
Mia llamm, Miclwlle Akers..I ulin Foudy, and my rwrsonal favorite. Kristine I.illy, were my idols­when I got "No. 1:r· ( Krislinn Lilly) to sign my jersny at a WUSA game, I'm pretty sun~ my dad had to drag me ofT tlw field, fnmm from shock and unable to talk. I rmnembnr going to dinner and ovnrhearing an oldnr couple at tho next table discussing America's win over China; they w11re mainly horrified that Brandi Chastain had even thought to tear oil' her shirt in victory. I couldn't have bnen proudnr. 
But from those years follow­ing the rise of women's soccer to glory in America, sonwthing has happened-it's fallen oiT the radar. Copies of Sports Illustrated with Chastain cele­brating in her sports bra on the cover are probably buried in the corner of some 20-something girl's room now, forgotten and unimportant. And with good reason. That was the last time the United Statns won a World Cup, showed hope for a nation dominated by male sports of football and baseball. 

And even though the U.S. took gold at the Olympics this sum­mer, it just didn't feel the same, maybe because I wasn't 12 or wearing at Lilly jersey at the time, but I don't think that was it. It just wasn't as exciting. Thesn weren't faces I had come to know and chner for. They were just another team. 
But the 2008 College Cup gives my hope that that's about to change. Call it a hunch, but I feel history in the making here. Notre Dame, UCLA, North Carolina, and Stanford all have something to do with it. 
Take a look at the Irish rostnr. Kerri Hanks passed Mia llamm on the career assist list, she's not too far behind in goals either. llanks, along with Carrie Dew, Brittany Bock, Michele Weissenhofer and Elise Weber are all members of the U-23 National team. Notre Dame is a microcosm of the future of women's soccer. 
But take a look at the Final Four and the list of' individuals that likely become household names. UClA boasts Lauren Cheney and Tina DiMartino, both of whom have suited up for the National Team, alongside stars like Shannon Box. North Carolina's Tobin Heath has also donned the red, white and blue. And Irish members of the U-23 team have played alongside Stanford's Marisa Abegg. 
They're not all leading scorers or offensive stars either, they're a group of young women who will compose a team that fea­tures both goal-scorers and players who will prevent goals. These players are what American soccer will look like in years to come. 
Names like Hamm and Chastain aren't likely to be for-gotten and Lilly is still playing, as a matter of fact. But there's a new generation waiting to take the turf-but first they have to take the lield this weekend in Cary, N.C. 


Hegardless of who takes the title this weekend, fans are in for a good show. They'll be able to say "I saw Kerri Hanks when she was still at Notre Dame." And when the players leave the field -many of them for their final college game -it won't be the last game they play. They'll go on to train with the national team and take up a role in the newly-formed Women's Professional Soccer league. 
Hopefully this league can sur­vive longer than three years, and I have hope that these play­ers will help that happen. 
So don't be surprised if you see some of' those faces scroll­ing across your TV screen dur­ing the 2011 World Cup, and that you actually know who they are.

Irish head to Cary, N.C., in pursuit of perfection 
Team looks to put finishing touches on undefeated campaign 
By FRAN TOLAN A~socia1c Spons Ediwr 
Notre Damn travels to the College Cup in Cary, N.C. this weekend with a lofty goal ­to finish ofT the best season in program history. The lop­ranked Irish are 25-0-0 and will have to dnfnal two other No. 1 seeds to bring home the National Championship tro­phy. 
"We have 25-wins going into tho Final Four and that is just so hard to do in this day and age," Irish coach Handy Waldrum said. " ... If this team goes on and finishes out unde­fmttnd, this team is dearly the bnsl Iin program history I because the record shows it. If they win it all, then then~·s not much of an argument." 

Waldrum said that the 2004 Irish are the current Notre Dame gold standard -for now. 
"We have to continue to keep these players motivated because until we win it all, thn '04 Iteam] is one of-if not the best-team here," he said. 
Waldrum said he is especial­ly excited for this weekend because the Notre Dame sen­iors will have one more chance at winning a title. The class has travelled to the College Cup the past two sea­sons before going home empty-handed. 
"I am really, really happy," Waldrum said. ''I'm most happy for our senior dass to get one more shot at it."

think this is the best team I've -been on," she said. The Irish will open play at 
4:30 this afternoon against Stanford at WakeMed Soccer Park. The Cardinal, who boast a 21-1-1 record, are one of the four No. 1 seeds in the College Cup. The other semifi­nal will pit North Carolina against undefeated UCLA. 
"All four No. 1 seeds made it and I can't remember the last time that happened," Waldrum said. "Between the four teams, there are only two losses [in their combined records). Any of the four is capable of winning it all." 
Notre Dame dealt North Carolina its only loss of the season and Stanford's only setback came against UCLA. 
Waldrum said he is not con­cerned with a possible matchup with the Tar Heels in their home state. The Irish defeated North Carolina 1-0 on Sept. 5 in Chapel Hill. 
"Carolina has been a good place for us to play over the years," the coach said. "Plus, our kids kind of get motivated to play in North Carolina's backyard." 
Notre Dame has gotten a goal from 19 different players this season, but Waldrum said he is most happy with the recent play of the Irish back line. 
"We've always had a team that can score goals and cre­ate offensive opportunities but the thing I'm most proud of has been the really good defense." 
Senior co-captain Carrie Dew leads the unit, which has given up an average of .40 goals per game. Dew is the reigning Top Drawer Soccer national player of the week. The center back played last season with a knee brace but Waldrum said she has fully recovered from the injury. 
"Carrie Dew is finally healthy, but because people love stats she's just not talked about as much [as the Irish forwards]," Waldrum said. "Defense is where we made 
the  biggest  upgrade  this  
year."  
The  Irish  back line  will  

have to be stout today because goals should be hard to come by against Stanford goalie Kira Maker and the Cardinal defense. The unit has posted shutouts in 14 of its 21 wins. 
Notre Dame and Stanford will take the field today at 
4:30 p.m. The game will be broadcast live on ESPN2 and ESPNU.

By ANALISE LIPARI 
Scene Editor 

Starting tonight in the Washington Hall Lab Theater, Sarin's Theater for Charity will present its production of Eric Coble's "Bright Ideas," a dark comedy version of Shakespeare's classic tragedy, "Macbeth." The founder of Sorin's Theater for Charity, John Maltese, recently spoke to the Observer via e-mail to discuss the production, as well as the beneficiary of the show's ticket sales, St. Jude's Primary School in Uganda. 
Scene: Can you give us a synopsis of "Bright Ideas?" 
Maltese: "Bright Ideas" is a dark comedy spoof of Shakespeare's "Macbeth." I view it as a critique of our current education system. Nowadays, every Notre Dame student could relate to how stressful it is to try and gain acceptance to a selective univer­sity. Eric Coble, the playwright, turns that idea on its head, by allowing to new parents, Joshua and Genevra Bradley, to get caught up in the same high-anxiety application process, but on behalf of their three-year old son, Mac. 
"Bright Ideas" is actually a highly selective pre­

c~ool, and after reading a few too many parenting 
gmdebooks, Josh and Gen get it in their heads that 
·r Mac doesn't go to the right preschool, he will be 
ruined for life. In a desperate attempt to get him in 
off the waiting list, the parents decide that the only 
way to give Mac "a shot in life" is murdering the 
other of the boy who got in ahead of him. 
After plotting the perfect crime, Josh and Gen decide that the only way they can kill the [mother] and make it look like an accident is to invite her ()Ver for dinner and poison the pesto. 
"Bright Ideas" is a hilarious tale about how most times, the grass is not greener on the other side. 
s Josh and Gen deal with new-found power, con­flicting desires, and their own insecurities, chaos ensues. 
Scene: Why did you choose this play? 
Maltese: I chose the play because I thought that the high-pressure attitudes about getting the "best opportunities" and ensuring success through edu­cation were reflective of issues most students at 
otre Dame can relate to today. The play also has 
II sorts of comedic elements that I thought would nake for an entertaining hour and 45 minutes for student audiences. The minimalist staging was also convenient, since we try to keep a low budget to allow for the maximum amount of proceeds to go towards our charity. 
Scene: What are some highlights from the per­formance? 
Maltese: Sarin's rector, Father Jim King, C.S.C., plays two parts -a nerdy, "Office Space"-esque boss) and a crusty old athletic director,. Coach Angus. He does amazingly well in both parts in his theatrical debut. He steals the show. Also, Shay Thornton and Matt Goodrich, seasoned FTT stu­?ents, drive the show as Josh and Gen. appearing m almost every scene. In the short two-week ehearsal period they each memorized a full length 
lay and have created characters that you can see develop onstage as they [grow] from concerned parents to psychotic killers. 
"Bright Id~as" is cast of 10 performers conveying nearly 20 different characters. Each character is quirky and unique, from Miss aithness, the over­the-top drama teacher, to Mrs. Lennox, who can only speak to other parents using hand puppets, to ~he ~amboyant airline steward who engages in an m flight confrontation with Genevra over her cell phone use. 
"Bright Ideas" represents every current class at Notre Dame, and also includes students from Saint Mary's. 
The biggest highlight is the good cause that this play is all about. My number one goal is selling out every night and raising over $6,000 for St. Jude's Primary School. 
Scene: Can you tell us more about Sorin Theater for Charity and St. Jude's? Have you put on any previous plays for the same cause? 
Ma~tese: I_ started Sorin Theatre for Charity last y~ar m our maugural showing of "Rumors" by Neil Simon. The play involved constructing the largest set that has ever been used in the Lab Theatre, a two-story set with five doors. The play ran two nights in the Lab theatre and sold out each night ... We were turning people away at the door because of fire codes. This year we are back with seven nights of performances to avoid that problem. 
I t~ok an interest in Sarin's sponsorship of St. Jude s when I was selected to teach their last sum­
mer through the International Summer Service Learning Program through the Center for Social Concerns. 
I wanted to show I was serious about my decision to teach at St. Jude's -Sorin sends one Otter there every summer -and I wanted to use my knowledge and love of theatre, as a Theatre/Philosophy major, to do some good in a personal way. I assistant directed -alongside Chelsea Moore, who is acting in "Bright Ideas" and acted in "Rumors" -and this year I am directing "Bright Ideas." 

St. Jude's is a primary school that needs a lot of help. It is located in Bugembe, which is a rural, poor community in eastern Uganda. Walking around to various schools, one of the hardest things to hear when talking to principals of schools was their answer to my question: "What is your greatest need? What could help your school out the most?" One administrator responded: "Money, so we can feed our students." He didn't ask for Powerpoint projectors, white boards, or a higher salary. He didn't even ask for pens and textbooks which students there don't have either. But h~ asked for food. 
That blew me away, and proved that we need to keep working for the people there. A number of the students are also HIV-positive, and the school can't afford to give them proper nutrition, let alone pay for counseling or other appropriate actions. Many students are simply sent home because their parents cannot afford to pay their school fees. 
Our number one priority is to fill those seats in the audience so we can give St. Jude's the tools they need to make their good school even better. 
Tonight's performance will begin at 8 p.m. in the Lab Theater of Washington Hall, and will continue through Thursday, Dec. 11. Tickets cost $7 for stu-.:::~fii!Mll'" dents at Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and Holy Cross. The theater is located on the third floor of Washington Hall.

Wie ties for lead after second round 
Associated Press 

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. Weaving her way through a narrow hallway next to the grill room Thursday, Michelle Wie was stopped by a woman who asked if she would pose for a picture with her young daughter. 
Foeusing her camera, the woman asked how she played. "OK," Wie said with a smile and shrug. 
If that were an honest assessment, Wie should be in good shape at the LPGA Tour qualifying tournament. 
Changing her tactics off the tee on the more forgiving Champions course at LPGA International, the 19-year-old from Hawaii hit driver on all but two holes and ran orr four straight birdies late in her round for a 7-under 65 that put her in a tie for the lead with Shiho Oyama of Japan after the second of five rounds at Q-school. 
Oyama shot 70 on the Legends course and joined Wie at 10-under 134. The top 20 players after the 90-hole tournament Sunday earn their LPGA Tour cards for next sea­son. Through two rounds, Wie was eight shots clear of the cutoll". 
Stacy Lewis, a former NCAA champion at Arkansas who tied for third at the U.S. Women's Open in her pro debut this summer, shot a 66 for the best score this week on the Legends course and one shot behind at 9-under 135. 
It was the first time since the second round of the 2006 Evian Masters that Wie had a share of the lead after any round, and the first time since the Ladies German Open in late May that she put together consecutive rounds in the 60s -at least officially. 
Wie had three straight scores in the 60s at the LPGA State Farm Classic in July when she was disqualified for leaving the scoring area with­out signing her card after the second round, so only the first round is in the books. 
Without that disqualifica­tion, Wie might have earned enough money to avoid Q­school. She also could have skipped the worst school in golf if she had showed this form earlier in the season. 
But she is here with no other choice but to get a card, and she's making the most of it. 
The first two rounds were strong indicators that a teenager who once had unlim­ited potential is closer than ever to recovering from injured wrists, shattered con­fidence and humbling per­formances. 
Arter hitting only four driv­ers on the Legends course Wednesday -a tighter, more punishing track -Wie was far more aggressive in the second round and holed enough putts for her lowest round on the LPGA Tour since a 65 at the Samsung World International in 2005, the week of her pro debut (which also ended in disqualification). 
Swing coach David Leadbetter wasn't around, but Wie carried out his hopes ­avoid mistakes and big num­bers. There was nothing close to the quintuple-bogey 9 that knocked her out of the U.S. Women's Open this year, and even the three fairways she missed in the second round were not far from her target. 
The longest putt she had for par came on No. 11, her sec­ond hole, when she ran a 25­foot birdie attempt 4 feet past the hole. Wie took only 24 putts, helped by three simple up-and-downs and a 40-foot chip she holed for birdie on No. 17. 
She missed birdie putts of 8 feet and 6 feet on consecutive holes early on her back nine, and while she continued to hit driver, Wie also stayed conser­vative on the par 5s by laying up three times when she could have reached the green. On the fifth, she had only 210 yards off a slight hill, but played a short iron and then stuffed a wedge to 3 feet. 
That began the late run of birdies. She hit her tee shot to 7 feet on the 145-yard sixth, holed another 7-foot birdie putt on the seventh hole and closed out her birdie string with an 8-foot putt. 
Through two days on each course, Wie's only mistake has been a three-putt bogey from 25 feet Wednesday.

Washington still looking for coach 
Associated Press 

Mike Leach has removed himself from consideration for the University of Washington's coaching posi­tion, a person·close to the Texas Tech coach said Thursday night. 
"lie's out," said the person who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about the move. 
The news came on the same day Fresno State coach Pat Hill also took his name out of 
the  mix  to  replace  
Washington's  Tyrone  
Willingham, who  was  fired  

and will coach his last game Saturday. 
Tommy Tuberville's resigna­tion at Auburn began another round of college football's season-ending coaching carousel. 
A day after Tuberville sur­prised the school by resign­ing, two schools came up with new coaches Thursday: Utah State hired Utah defensive coordinator Gary Andersen and Toledo hired Oklahoma State defensive coordinator Tim Beckman. 
Texas Tech was working on a contract extension for Leach, who reportedly had met with Washington officials about the Huskies' opening earlier this week. 
Meanwhile, Auburn's wish­list to replace Tuberville includes Leach, Louisiana Tech's Derek Dooley, Arkansas' Bobby Petrino and Jimbo Fisher at Florida State and Will Muschamp at Texas. 
Hill, completing his 12th season at Fresno State, inter­viewed for the Washington job Saturday and said he had asked the school for an answer Wednesday. 
On Thursday, he said: "I had a great visit with the leadership at the University of Washington and I have a great deal of respect for them and their vision. Because of the time frame we discussed ... it's apparent that I'm not their top candidate. I appreci­ate their consideration." 
Tuberville became the third Southeastern Conference coach to depart this season. The others are Sylvester Croom at Mississippi State and Phillip Fulmer at Tennessee. Lane Kiffin replaced Fulmer on Sunday. 
Earlier this week, Missouri offensive coordinator Dave Christensen was hired at Wyoming, replacing Joe Glenn, who was fired Nov. 23.

Renteria rejoins National League 
AP 

Fonner Detroit shortstop Edgar Renteria swings in a July 29, 2008 game. Renteria signed a two-year contract with the Giants Thursday. 

Associated Press 

SAN FRANCISCO -Edgar Renteria is back in the National League, where he thinks he belongs. 
Renteria became the sec­ond free agent to join the San Francisco Giants in two days, receiving an $18.5 mil­lion, two-year contract Thursday to replace 11-time Gold Glove shortstop Omar Vizquel. 
A five-time N L All-Star, Renteria has spent 11 of his 13 major league seasons in the National League. He won a World Series ring with the 1997 Florida Marlins and a pennant in 2004 with St. Louis, but struggled during a pair of one-season stints in the AL, with Boston in 2005 and Detroit this year. 
"I played good in the National League. I feel real comfortable," Renteria said on a conference call. "Maybe I know more of the game in the National League. It's my type of league. I like to play the game. The American League is different-you have to go for the home run and wait for hitting. That's no excuse for what happened in the American League, but it might be why I'm so excit­ed to get back to the National League." 
Renteria gets a $2 million signing bonus, $7 million next year and $9 million in 2010. The Giants have a $10.5 million option for 2011 with a $500,000 buyout. 
Giants general manager Brian Sabean has had a busy week, signing right-handed reliever Bobby Howry to a 
one-year contract Wednesday and following that up by securing Renteria. The sides had all but finalized a deal during a meeting Wednesday. 
Renteria, a career .290 hit­ter, was back in Miami on Thursday after a quick visit to San Francisco. 
"We really appreciate his interest and look forward to a relationship that's going to be fruitful on both sides. I don't think Edgar needs any introduction," Sabean said. "We're just thrilled to put him in our No. 2 spot in the lineup and at shortstop and move on to other business." 
The Tigers declined to offer Renteria salary arbitration Monday. While he was being pursued by three or four teams, Renteria said the Giants' strong interest meant a lot to him in making the decision. 
"I want to go where the people want me to go. I don't go where they don't want me," he said. "The Giants were interested in signing me. That's a great city to play baseball." 
Renteria will be looking to have a better year in 2009. He batted .270 with 10 homers and 55 RBis this sea­son for the Tigers, who after­ward declined their $11 mil­lion option and gave him a $3 million buyout. 
Sabean isn't concerned about Renteria, especially considering he had a better second half. 
"We have no reservations of him being a shortstop and what he's going to do for our offense," the GM said. "It's an upgrade."

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.-Antonio Pierce and the doctor who treated his New York Giants team­mate Plaxico Burress after he accidentally shot him­self at a Manhattan night­club will talk to investiga­tors Friday. 
Pierce and Dr. Josyann Abisaab will be accompa­nied by their lawyers when they meet with the author­ities, NYPD Deputy Commissioner for Public Information Paul Browne said. It is unclear when and where the parties will meet. 
The authorities are espe­cially interested in why neither Pierce, who drove Burress to New York­Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center, nor Abisaab called police to report the shooting early Saturday. Abisaab has since been suspended for not reporting the gunshot injury, as required by law. 
Police are trying to determine whether Pierce tried to cover up the shoot­ing. They say Pierce returned to New Jersey with Burress' gun in the glove compartment of his black Cadillac Escalade, and investigators have impounded the SUV to search it for any blood or gun residue. 
Pierce's attorney said Pierce was caught off guard early Saturday when Burress somehow fumbled his gun-.40-cal­iber Glock -in the VIP section of a Manhattan 
IN BRIEF Federal judge to decide fate 
of five suspended players 
MINNEAPOliS'-A federal judge will be asked to decide Friday whether five suspended NFL players deserve a chance to play this weekend. 
At issue is whether the league had a duty to notifY its players and their union that a dietary supplement the five took contained a banned ingredient. The NFL Players Association argues in a lawsuit filed Thursday that the NFL knew about the tainted supplement but failed to share that information with players whose careers were on the line. 
The union filed the lawsuit to block the suspensions offive ofthe six players who were benched this week for violating the league's anti-doping policy. The union wants Kevin Williams and Pat Williams of the Minnesota Vikings, and Charles Grant, Deuce McAili<;ter and Will Smith of the New Orleans Saints, to be eligible to play Sunday. 
Union attorneys will go before U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson at 10:30 
a.m. in St. Paul on Friday to a'>k for a preliminary injunction. They said in fil­ings Thursday that the players are criti­cal to their teams' playoff hopes. 
nightclub and it dis­charged, hitting his right thigh. 
"He had no idea Plaxico had a weapon," attorney Michael Bachner said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. 
And Bachner stressed the linebacker would coop­erate with authorities and testify before a Manhattan grand jury about the inci­dent if asked to testify, which has yet to happen. 
"Antonio has always taken a position that he will be cooperative in the investigation with law enforcement," Bachner said. "Should Antonio be subpoenaed to the grand jury, and we have no idea that is going to happen, but if he is, he is going to abide by his obligations as 
Four counts dropped against
Bonds, I 0 charges remain 
-SAN FRANCISCO -Federal prose­cutors dropped four counts of lying to a grand jury against Barry Bonds, leaving him to face trial next year on 10 counts of making false statements plus an addition obstruction of justice charge. 
Bonds faces the same potential sen­tence range -probation to roughly two years in prison -if convicted. His trial is scheduled to begin March 2. 
Thursday's indictment, the third against the home-run king, came in response to U.S. District Judge Susan Illston's decision last week ordering prosecutors to again rewrite the tech­nically faulty indictment. 
Bonds was originally charged in November 2007 with four counts of pet:jury and one count of obstruction of justice. After a motion by his lawyers to dismiss the case, Illston ordered prosecutors to rewrite the indictment because multiple alleged lies were lumped into single charges. 
a citizen." 
Bachner did not immedi­ately return a telephone message Thursday evening, seeking comment on Pierce's meeting with investigators. 
Pierce was in no mood to discuss the shooting inci­dent after practice at Giants Stadium. 
Clad in a sweat-soaked gray pullover, the line­backer walked up to the wooden lectern, clenched the sides with gloved hands and spoke mostly about the Giants' game on Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles. He insisted he won't be dis­tracted with the Giants (11-1) on the verge of clinching the NFC East title and a first-round bye in the playoffs. 

Avery meets with Bettman 
about len!!th of suspension
NEW YORI{'-Sean Avery surged past camera crews and reporters Thursday, choosing to save his com­ments this time for NHL commissioner Gary Bettman during a three-hour dis­ciplinary hearing. 
The Dallas Stars forward was sus­pended indefinitely on Tuesday just hours after he used a crude expression to describe former girlfriends now dat­ing others while speaking to reporters. 
Hockey's most notorious pest came to league headquarters in midtown Manhattan to give his version ofthe lat­est events that landed him in big trou­ble. Now it's up to Bettman to deter­mine just how long Avery will be kept offthe ice. 
The NHL said that announcement would be made Friday. 
"I haven't made a decision yet," Bettman said Thursday during his weekly radio show broadcast on NHL.com. "I want to take the opportu­nity to spend a little time thinking about what transpired at the hearing and everything that I was told and that needs to be considered.

S~erre~aftersurgery 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA -Eric Shanteau looks as healthy as any other swimmer on deck at the Georgia Tech Aquatic Center. 
But there are still those nag­ging fears that all cancer vic­tims must overcome: What if tho doctors didn't get it all? What if the dreaded disease is hiding somewhere in his body, waiting to strike again? 
Shanteau. one of the most inspiring athletes of the Beijing Olympics, is competing this week for the first time since his surgery for testicular cancer. lie hopes he thrill of the race will help him get on with the rest of his life. a minefield of doubts that revmtls itself with every little ache and pain. 
"You're like, 'Is that cancer? Is it coming back?"' said Shantcau, one of several Olympians taking part in the 
U.S. Short Course Nationals that began Thursday. "That's kind of what I've had to learn to deal with, and what I'm still just learning to deal with." 
lie's off to a good start in Atlanta. Shanteau finished sec­ond to Olympic gold medalist Hyan Lochte in the 200-yard individual medley, beating his personal best when he touched in 1 minute, 42.59 seconds. Lochte won going away in 1:40.89. 
"That came out of nowhere," a beaming Shanteau said. 
llis plight leading up to the Beijing Olympics made him a rallying figure for millions touched by cancer. 
Receiving his shocking diag­nosis shortly before the U.S. 
trials, Shanteau didn't tell any­one except those closest to him. Then, he surprisingly made the team in the 200­meter breaststroke, beating out overwhelming favorite and former world record-holder Brendan Hansen. 
Shanteau was left with an excruciating decision. He chose to pursue his lifelong goal of swimming in the Olympics, even though it meant putting off surgery until after the games and running the risk of the cancer spread­ing. He went public with his story, hoping it would show others that even the dreaded C-word doesn't have to ruin your dreams. 
While there was no llollywood ending in the pool -Shanteau was eliminated in the semifinals -the cancer remained in check, from all indications. Shanteau under­went surgery on Aug. 26, two days after the closing cere­monies, and tests since then have come back normal. He got the latest bit of good news just before Thanksgiving. 
Even so, Shanteau had to be talked out of further treat­ment. Worried that his cancer might return, he strongly con­sidered undergoing a round of chemotherapy, which likely would have been delayed his comeback while he dealt with miserable side effects such as nausea, weakness and hair loss. 
"Everyone prepares you for dealing with the cancer, the surgery, getting rid of it, yada, yada, yada," he said. "But no one prepares you for life after it. It's like, 'OK, you've had it.

Now you have a chance of it coming back. But here, go live your life.' To be honest, I kind of freaked out." 
Shanteau turned to many of the same support groups that had called on him to serve as a face for the victims, the one who was supposed to provide hope but found himself over­whelmed by the dread of being stricken again. 
"I expected to just be free and clear and done with it after the surgery," he said. "But that's not how my thought process was. I started thinking, 'What if it comes back? Is it going to come back?'" 
That's what brought him back to the pool much quicker than Olympic stars such as Michael Phelps and Natalie Coughlin, both still on break since Beijing. 
"This was sort of a way for me to take back a little bit of control," Shanteau said. 
He returned to training about 5 1/2 weeks after his surgery. His first attempt last­ed mere seconds-as soon as he extended his arms above his head, he felt an intense stretching sensation in his groin area, where doctors made a deep incision to remove the cancerous testicle 
He took another week off, felt fine and has been training ever since. The short course meet gave him a chance to return to competition in his hometown-he grew up in suburban Atlanta-and get a feel for where he needs to be to qualify for the world cham­pionships in Rome next sum­mer.

NFL 
Browns' Dawson hopes 
for first Pro-Bo\Vl bid 
Associated Press 
BEREA, Ohio Phil Dawson has not been to Hawaii since his honeymoon. He would like to take his wife back in February to celebrate their lOth wedding anniver­sary. 
And maybe play in his first Pro Bowl. 
"It could be two trips in one," Dawson said with a smile Thursday as he laced up his spikes before practice. "I could even play it off as, 'Honey, I'm taking you back to where it all started, and if you don't mind, I'm going to kick a few balls while we're here."' 
Shannon Dawson would not mind mixing some sun and fun with football. 
Overlooked for years, Dawson may deserve a Pro Bowl spot. 
Cleveland's rock-steady kicker has been one of the few bright spots this season for the dismal Browns (4-8), who have failed to live up to high expectations. But while his teammates commit penal­ties, drop passes and miss tackles, Dawson, as always, has been dependable, exact and consistent. 
Just like his kicks. 
The lone player left from the Browns' 1999 expansion team, Dawson has converted 26 of 30 field-goal attempts and made three of the longest kicks of his 10-year career, including a game-winning 56­yarder to beat Buffalo on Nov. 17. Dawson recently made 13 straight field goals -three over 50 yards -and his next make will match his eareer high (27) for a season. 
Only Lou Groza and Don Cockroft have scored more career points for Cleveland than Dawson, who also scored the first rushing touchdown for the new Browns on a fake field goal in 1999. 
However, one thing has remains out of Dawson's range: a Pro Bowl. 
"It's a career goal of mine," Dawson said. "Sometimes you wonder if people notice what you do. Unfortunately, I've been on a losing team eight of the last 10 years. There's been probably about three seasons sprinkled in there where I thought I had a chance. Not to take anything from the guys who were named because the AFC is loaded with great kickers, but I feel pretty good about what I've been able to do in the conditions I find myself 
in." 
Ah, the conditions. 
In Cleveland's lakefront sta­dium, the weather in November and December can be unbearable and unpre­dictable. With swirling, gust­ing winds, lake-effect snow, freezing temperatures, rain, ice and sleet, it's no place for a picnic. 
No, it is not San Diego and it is not under an inflatable roof, which is why Dawson's precision -he is currently the league's seventh most accurate kicker of all-time at 
83.2 percent-is so impres­sive. Dawson has to kick on a natural, grass surface as temperamental as the weath­er. Even on dry days, Cleveland's turf can be unfor­giving. 
"For Phil to have the career he has had here is unbeliev­able," said long snapper Ryan Pontbriand, a Pro Bowler last season. ''I'd rank him above just about everybody because 
of where he has played and what he has done.'' 
Week after week, visiting kickers and punters express their disbelief to Dawson and Browns punter Dave Zastudil about the challenge of doing their jobs well in Cleveland. In last week's 16-6 Joss to Indianapolis, Colts kicker Adam Vinatieri missed a 46­yarder and later told Dawson he cannot imagine kicking here all the time. 
"When Adam, who has made game-winning kicks in the Super Bowl, tells me how difficult it is to kick in Cleveland and how glad he is that he doesn't have to kick here, that means a lot," Dawson said. 
Never one to make excuses, Dawson was wide right with a 34-yard kick last week that he said looked perfect as it came off his right foot. 
"I did everything exactly how I wanted to, and the ball didn't go in the air the way I thought it would," he said. "That's why I say I'm close to going insane because as hard as I work and as prepared as I am, when you kick in Cleveland you are going to have kicks that don't go through that should.''

Squad enters MIAA play with confidence 
By ALEX BARKER Sporrs Wri rer 

Fresh of!' il'i first conference vie­tory of' the season against Trine, Saint Mary's will try to stay unde­fi-"mtnd in thn MIAA when it hosl<> Calvin Saturday at the Angela Athldic C~ntt~r. 
Wednesday, the Belles knocked ofT Trine S0-72 in the opening gam11 of' MIAA eonf'erenee play. Senior forward Erin Newsom scored a team-high 18 poinl<> and ~-,rrabbed 10 rebounds to paee the Bellns. It was her third double-dou­bln of' the season. 
A'i a team, Saint Mary's eould not have played mud1 better. The team shot 32-f'or-50 from the floor against tlw Thunder. Their 5S per­cent shooting pereentagn was the highest percentage ever for the Belles undnr mach Jenn I hmley. 
Tho win also marked the first time sinee 2002 the Belles have won their MIM optmer. 
Over Thanksgiving break, the team played against tough compe­tition in preparation liw conference play 
"Tho Wlwaton game wa<> a great win lilr us," senior forward Nicole Beier said. "rt was frustrating to lose another dose game. but I think that the team is moving in the right direction." 
The Bolles knocked oft· Wheaton for the first time in 10 tries before dropping two games in the Saint Mary's Thanksgiving Oassic. Saint Mary's fell to eventual tournament chmnpion Otterbein by three points in the first game and dropped another against No. 21 Chicago in the second. 
"The games over break have prepared us well for our upeoming conference games," Beier said. 
Looking ahead to the MIM com­petition that awaits the Belles this season, Beier and the team have two important goals heading for­ward. 
"Our ultimate goal is to win eon­fbrenee this sea<>on and reach the finaL., of' the postseason conlbrnnce tournament," Beier said. 
Saint Mary's has perfi)rmed well in the paint this season, dominat­ing the boards by an average mar­gin of six rebounds per game. Junior forward Anna Kammrath leads the team this season with 
10.8 rebounds per game, just in front of Newsom's 9.2 boards per game. 
The Belles will have their hands full this weekend with Calvin, who finished third in the conference last season, one spot ahead of Saint Mary's. In two matchups la'it sea­son, the Knights claimed victory both times.

geographic proximity. 
"We both have a lot of players from the Midwest, so I think that makes it a bigger rivalry, especially for the players from Indiana," she said. 
This season, both teams come into the game ranked. The Irish are No. 11 in the AP poll and No. 8 in the coaches' poll; Purdue is No. 17 and No. 20, respectively. 
McGraw said both teams' ranking will not affect the level of play on Saturday, because it is always a hard-lbught game.

"It's a great game to play every year. I would say the majority of the years, at least one of us was ranked, ifnot both of us. So, I think it would be just as intense as if neither team were ranked. It's just that kind of game," she said. 
The last time out, Notre Dame beat Eastern Michigan 83-63 in Ypsilanti, Mich. Although the Irish pulled out the win, they did not shoot particularly well, going only 
38.9 percent from the floor. Sophomore forward Becca Bruszewski had a particularly disap­pointing night, making only one of her 10 shots in 27 minutes. But McGraw said Bruszewski and the rest ofthe Irish just had an offnight that night 
"I think that was an anomaly. I think that when you look at our shooting percentages overall, indi­vidually Becca is shooting 54 per­cent from the field and Erica Solomon 64 percent from the field," McGraw said. "Everybody's shooting the ball a lot better than they did in that particular game. I'm not wor­ried about that, and we're playing at home, so we are definitely going to shoot the ball a little bit better." 
Purdue fell to 5-2 Thursday night after losing to No. 8 Maryland 70-59 in the ACOBig Ten Challenge. The Terrapins held the Boilermakers to only 2-of-17 shooting from 3-point land, an impressive feat considering Purdue's prolific scoring from beyond the arc. 
After the loss to Maryland, Purdue is shooting 40 percent of its 3s as a team, with guards Jodi Howell (12­of-25) and Brittany Rayburn (13-of­
36) leading the way. Junior FahKara Malone is also shooting 34.5 percent from distance. 
"I think that those three are a threat from the perimeter. And they didn't have Rayburn or Jodi Howell last year, so they definitely have improved their shooting threat," McGraw said. 
McGraw said the Boilermaker bigs will be a test for her post play­ers, and that forward Lindsay Wisdom-Hylton is the best player her team has seen to date. 
"She gives us concern not just with her size but with her mobility. She's going to be a real tough chal­lenge for us," McGraw said. 
Tip-offfor the game is at 2 p.m. on Sunday. 
Notes: 
+The Purdue game is the first sell-out of the season for the Irish, and the third in two years for the Joyce Center. 
Although tickets are gone for fans, there are still 300 student tickets available for the game. The first 300 arriving students will also receive a free T-shirt and a McDonald's gift certificate.

Teatns go to Coluinbus for OSU Invitational 
By MIKE GOTIMER Sports Writer 
This weekend, Notre Dame travels to Columbus to partici­pate in the Ohio State Invitational in what will be their final competition of 2008. 
The men's team returns to the meet after a fourth-place finish in 2007. It will face off against Ohio State, Cleveland State, Minnesota and Penn State in the swimming events while Iowa, South Carolina and Duke will only participate in the diving events. The meet will be the second time this year that Notre Dame will face off against both Ohio State and Cleveland State. In their previous meetings, the Irish lost to the Buckeyes 172.5­
86.5 but defeated the Vikings by a score of 132-109. 
"In a lot of ways this is the focal point of the fall semes­ter," Irish coach Tim Welsh said. "It's the first time this season we will have a chance to swim in prelims and finals in the same event on the same 
Bulldogs

season, they're going to come back and seek revenge," Notre Dame center Christian Hanson said. "We did it against Boston College this season, and two years ago we did it against Alaska." 
Notre Dame coach Jeff Jackson said the key to spoiling Ferris State's bid at revenge would be adjusting to the Bulldog's unique defensive trap style of play. 
"Their system is built to cre­ate turnovers," Jackson said. "And if you turn the puck over, then they transition pretty well." 
Jackson said the team has been working on puck control during the week, specifically making better plays off the boards. 
"We just have to be a lot more patient with the puck and pick the chances that we take," Hanson said. 
The Bulldogs have received balanced scoring so far this season, with five players notch­ing over 10 points on the year. Ferris State is led on defense by sophomores Zach Redmond and Scott Wietecha. 
"They've got three good lines of forwards and one of the best defensive pairs in the confer­ence," Jackson said. 
The Irish will try to counter with some scoring of their own, most notably from freshman phenom Billy Maday, who Tuesday was named the CCHA Rookie of the Month for November. Maday is tied with Hanson for the team lead in goals with nine, and has totaled 15 points on the season. 
"When you lose a kid like 
day -a similar format to the Big East Conference and NCAA Championships." 
The No. 24 Notre Dame women's team returns to the pool for the first time since its Nov. 8 victory over Purdue. 
"We're excited because it has been a few weeks since we have competed," Irish coach Brian Barnes said. "It's a good three-day meet and it gives us a chance to swim one or two times a day with a lot of rest, and that's going to favor some of our best per­formances of the year." 
The Irish women will face off against Ohio State, Bowling Green, Cleveland State, Minnesota, Miami (Fl.), and Penn State in the swimming events while Indiana, North Carolina State, Arizona State, and Florida State will only participate in the diving events. 
The action in Columbus is set to begin Friday morning and finish Sunday evening. 
Contact Mike Gotimer at mgotimer@nd.edu 
Mark Van Guilder, you want to replace him with someone who's at least as good," Jackson said. "And thus far Billy's been as productive as Mark, and that bodes really well for us for this year and the future." 
Jackson also said, though, that Maday would have to adjust if he wanted his success to continue. 
"One of the dangers of play­ing as well as he had is that teams are going to start focus­ing on shutting him down," Jackson said. "That's some­thing he hasn't seen yet, and it's coming his way." 
Friday night's game will also mark Notre Dame's first game as the No. 1 team in the coun­try since the 2006-2007 season. Hanson said he expected oppo­nents to step their game up in an attempt to take down the Irish. 
"We have to realize that team's are going to give us their 'A' game every night," he said. 
This weekend's series also comes on the heels of the announcement that Irish soph­omore defensemen Ian Cole and Teddy Ruth were selected to the U.S. Junior National Team, and will play in the World Junior Championships in Ottawa Dec. 26-Jan. 5. Cole will be making his second appear­ance with the team, but it will be Ruth's first time playing for the red, white, and blue. 
''I'm just really happy for [Teddy] because he's perfect for playing in the World Juniors in Canada on the NHL sheet," Jackson said. "l-Ie's one of those blood-and-guts guys, those warriors, that every team needs to have."

Brey said he isn't going to try to 
rush Harangody back into the line­
up. 

''I'm going to be really cautious with this, because it i'> a big game,. but it isn't a big game either," Brey said. "I told Luke in the Los Angeles airport as he wa'i in mis­ery flying back, 'Worst ea'ie, if we have you 100 pereent as we're going over to play DePaul on New Year's Eve, that's when I need you."' 
So far, Notre Dame has played just fine in Harangody's absenee, though it ha'in't played anyone on tho same level eompetitively as Ohio State, who ic;; receiving votes in both polls and defeated No. 21/22 Miami 73-68 Tuesday. The lrL'ih defeated Furman and South Dakota by wide margins without llarangody. 
During those games, senior guard Kyle McAlarney continued hi<; hot shooting from the out'iide. In Notre Dame's la'it three games, McAlarney has hit 26-of-48 (54 percent) from three-point range ­he buried 10 against North Carolina in the finals of the Maui Invitational, nine against Furman and seven against South Dakota. 
"If I wa<; coaching again'it Kyle. I might pull the old Stephen Curry trick with a triangle-and-two on him," senior forward Zach Hillesland said, referring to the David<;on's 78-48 win over Loyola­Maryland, in which Loyola held the David'ion star to zero point<; by double-teaming him the entire game. "But the way he's been shooting ha'i been amazing." 
McAlarney added: "I credit my teammates, but I'm not expecting to be hot like this the whole sea­son. So there's other things that I feel like I'm bringing to the table that I need to be consistent with, like leadership." 
McAlarney, however, isn't the only one on a hot streak. Senior forward Ryan Ayers ha'i stepped up while Harangody has been out. 
Ayers scored 19 against Furman and had 25 point'> in the first half against South Dakota on his way to a career-high 35 for the game. 
"That's one of the things we talked about when we got back from Maui," Brey said. "I thought he· could've been a little mor<~ aggn~ssive out there and we need him to be, beeause they're going to take away Kyle or take away 'Gody and he is going to get those open looks and we don't want hin1 to be .~ashful or turn anything down. 
McAlarney and Ayers see a lot of opnn looks when tho Irish come down the floor in transition. and against Ohio State, if Notre Dame can brnak the Buckeyes' l'ull-court press, the Irish could get some open looks for thnir shooters. 
"They have a 2-2-1 press every made basket, every made free throw, and then go back to a zone," Brey said "That takes a kind of mental toughness and con­centration to attack both defenses; when to attack the press to score, and when to attack it and then attack their zone." 
ThP Buckeyes, coached by Thad Matta. average 65.8 points per game to Notrn Dame's 87.1, but Ohio State only allows 47.3 points per game to Notre Dame's 68.7. They spn~ad their seoring around their lineup, with guard Evan Turner as Ohio State's leading seorer with 13.8 points per game. 
Note: 
uMcAlarney, who is no fan of shaving, has been on his hot streak while sporting hi'> on-again, off-again board. 
"I know he rotates in and out of the Brett Favr11 look, but whatew~r he's doing with his facial hair, don't change right now," Brey said. "I don't want him to change."
