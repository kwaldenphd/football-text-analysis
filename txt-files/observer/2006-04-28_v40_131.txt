Dissenters criticize Jenkins' statement 
Bishop, professors ask University president to reconsider decision

Three weeks after University President Father John Jenkins issued a largely well-received closing statement permitting "The Vagina Monologues" on campus, prominent voices of dis­sent are beginning to emerge ­including that of South Bend-Fort 
Problems plague Webtnail 
OIT predicts faster service by finals week 
By KAITLYNN RIELY 
News Writer 
In this age of high-speed com­munication, people can spread news of an event to all corners of the world just minutes after it happens. But for Notre Dame stu­dents, opening up Webmail often recalls the days of the Pony Express. 
While the problem has been steadily building, during this spring semester in particular e­mail users have begun to notice longer delays in logging onto the e-mail program to read mes­sages. And though officials hope to alleviate the problem before the semester ends, a long-term fix may be more of a wait. 
"It goes slow a lot and some­times it goes so slow you can't really log in," freshman Kyle Peters said. "It usually just takes a couple of seconds, but when it's bad it takes a couple minutes. Usually ifit's taking a couple min­utes, I just 'X' out and don't even 
try." 
The Office of Information Technologies (OIT) is aware of the troubles users have had in accessing e-mail through e-mail clients Webmail, Outlook, Eudora and Thunderbird this semester. Denise Moser, consolidated oper­ations manager for OIT, said her office frequently receives calls from students and faculty experi­encing problems opening their e­mail quickly. 
Students tend to use Webmail, and faculty and staff use the other e-mail programs more fre­quently, but all are experiencing the same problems right now because they usc the same server, she said. 
see WEBMAIL/page 4 Wayne Bishop John D'Arcy, who issued a nine-page statement Thursday denouncing Jenkins' decision. 
Jenkins' April 5 decision to not prohibit the "Monologues" came 10 weeks after he appealed to the University community to engage in dialogue about academic free­dom and Catholic character at Notre Dame. 
D'Arcy, who said three weeks ago he was "deeply saddened" by the decision, criticized Jenkins Thursday for not "adequately and fully" including Catholic teaching in his closing statement. 
"My pastoral concern is not only because of the decision not to ban the play, but because of the rationale that accompanied the decision," D'Arcy said Thursday in a statement that will appear in the April 30 edition of Today's Catholic. "It fails to give room to the great truths of the faith." 
D'Arcy is not alone in his senti­ments. At Notre Dame, a series of letters to the editor by University professors printed in The Observer have criticized Jenkins' decision, several asking for Jenkins to reconsider. 
Jenkins responded in a state­ment Thursday, saying the public dissent -which heightened when an April 25 column written by law professor emeritus Charles Rice called for Jenkins' resignation -is part of a pro­ductive, ongoing dialogue. 

The University, he said, "bene­fits from fruitful discussion of dif­ficult issues." 
"Often, the voices of dissent present themselves louder than those of support," Jenkins said. "I continue to respect the opinions of those who have shared their views publicly and privately with me and other members of the University."

Although the walls of LaFortune are decked with many pictures of illustrious Notre Dame athletes and legends, nothing quite paral­lels the image that hangs there now. 
Thursday afternoon, the Multicultural Affairs Committee of Student Senate organized an unveiling ceremony of a special photograph of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. linking arms with a young Father Theodore Hesburgh, University president emeritus. 
The gathering, held in the Dooley Room of LaFortune, celebrated not only the unveiling of the picture but also King's legacy, Hesburgh's

Academic building in the works at SMC 

An artistic rendering of a yet-unnamed academic building was revealed to Saint Mary's Thursday. 
Director of Public Relations Melanie McDonald said the new building does not yet have a name -it is unclear whether it will be named after a particular donor -but as long as fund-raising goals are met, groundbreaking could begin as soon as fall 2006. 
Currently, Saint Mary's is $800,000 short of its $16,500,000 goal-which

Shack City to be built Saturday

Cotntnittee pilots ne-w course rating process 
By KATIE MCDONNELL News Writer 

It's crunch time. Your DART time is here, but the final spot for your first choice class was just filled. Now it's time to make the decision -do you pull up the vague course description in the undergradu­ate bulletin, or the heavily slanted opinions in NDToday.com's teacher rat­ings? 
Neither -at least at some point in the near future. Thanks to the efforts of the Committee for Better Informing Course Selection, Notre Dame students will one day have more detailed course informa­tion at their fingertips. Vice President and Associate Provost Dennis Jacobs heads the joint student, faculty and administrator committee work­ing to give students what he deemed a "richer description" of available courses before reg­istering. 

"We want to give students more detailed information ­what the course's intention is, learning goals, modes of learn­ing," Jacobs said. "To give stu­dents a much clearer picture about what they might be con­sidering." 
Currently, students com pile information from the course handbook, undergraduate bul­letins or department Web sites alongside external sources like NDToday.com. But senior Vijay Ramanan, the student chair of the committee, said the infor­mation these sources provide "is sometimes very good and in other situations quite spotty." 
While Web sites may be out­dated and descriptions often short, teacher evaluations on NDToday.com face the problem containing only a few, strong, variable opinions, he explained.

Thank you, everyone 
Barring a mirade or drunken mishap by somnone in the Hn1-,ristrar's oiTicn, I will probably not be delivering any gradua­tion day relln1:tions in any public forums (other than standing on a bar with a drink in my hand). (;iven that this will

No week­end wm; evor complnte without seeing you in Zahm trying to find out who did whatever out on the quad. l'vo never seen sonwono hamlin drunken idiol<; with such grace and composure. If I had a vote, I would give you, and all the night patrol safi~ty oflieers, a huge raise. Thanks fi1r hdping us make it home salil, bncausn Int.'s bP horwst, somo nighl<; that walk from D2 or Library Cirde can seem like a marathon, and no ono wanl<; to spend the night in a bush. 
Dining hall card swip<~rs. Despite our diflimmces over the years-the ind­denL<; involving Zahm dorm dinners and body paint-you always manage a smilo when we come in li1r a meal. You've actually convinced me in this last year that you know my namo, even though you're probably just <:heating off my II>. That's okay though, because hoaring you say "llello Samuel" actually eases the pain of knowing that I just spent $10 on tlw continent.al breakfast. So thank you fi1r the smiles, and I hopo they get you bolter chairs. 
I .ibrary security guards. For almost 20 hours a day, you keep us safe while we study. I can't even begin to imagine how good you are at solitaire on the computer. You've probably even played alllO,OOO games of FreeCell.

Goose befriends elderly cancer patient 
FERNAN LAKE, Idaho ­A northern Idaho man diag­nosed with terminal cancer says a usually cantankerous goose that befriended him on his walks has helped him live past doctors' predic­tions. 
Last fall Bill Lytle's, 73, skin turned yellow overnight, and doctors diag­nosed pancreatic cancer, giving Lytle only months to live. But Lytle continued his walks, having to cut them down to two miles at a near­by lake, where he met the goose who has inspired him to keep going even when he wasn't feeling well. 

The goose, about 30 pounds with a red beak and red feet, approaches Lytle when he calls and rubs its head against his arms. But it snaps at anyone else who gets too close. 
NASA says reducing road­kill will save astronauts 
CAPE CANAVEHAL, Fla. ­Picking up roadkill may save astronauts' lives. Kennedy Space Center managers said Thursday they have launched an effort encour­aging workers to notify road -and-grounds crews when they see roadkill. 
The theory is that remov­ing dead animals could cut down on the number of vul­tures looking for meals at the 140,000-acre center, part of which is a national wildlife refuge. 
A vulture struck the fuel tank of space shuttle Discovery during last year's launch, but it didn't cause any major damage. 
"We're trying to avoid that again and by doing that we're trying to reduce the food source," said John Shaffer, a scientist who works at Kennedy's environ­mental program oflice.

Red Rose Gala blossotns at ND 
Tonight's dinner and dance will raise money for YWCA and S-0-S 
By MEG HAN WONS News Writer 
When University President Father John Jenkins announced his decision to disallow the fundraising aspect of "The Vagina Monologues" this year, organizers of the hotly-debated performance, members of Feminist Voice. the Campus Alliancn for Rape Elimination and Student Government offi­cials united to plan an event in hopes of raising a portion of the $15,000 they had expected to get from the "Monologues" per­formance. 
The Red Rose Gala, to be held tonight from 8 p.m. to midnight in the East Wing of South Dining Hall, is a result of brainstorming and months of planning by stu­dents dedicated to providing continued support for the YWCA and S-0-S -two South Bend organizations that have previ­ously benefited from "The Vagina Monologues"' ticket pro­ceeds. 
The South Bend YWCA is a domestic violence and chemical dependency shelter that is only one of a handful in the nation to allow both women and their children. S-0-S, South Bend's only rape crisis center, also runs a support group for victims of rape. Funds raised by the Gala will be given to these organiza­tions to be used at their discre­tion. 
"These organizations have come to expect and rely on this donation,'' said Kaitlyn Redfield, one of the primary organizers of the Gala. "It is unconscionable that survivors of rape and domestic violence and their chil­dren, members of our own com­munity. be made to go without because of a political decision made by our University's presi­dent." 
As of Wednesday, approxi­mately 100 tickets had been sold for the event. Event organizers are hoping for a dancing, food and auction of items -such as a private tour of the tunnels, lunch with Jenkins in his office and hotel accommodations in Chicago ­the event will feature speaker Cynthia Mahmood, a University professor and expert anthropol­ogist in the field of gender vio­lence. 
"It is crucial that people on this campus understand that 
every 16 sec­
onds, a woman is 
beaten in her 
number closer "These organizations own home and to 500. every 2.5 sec­
have come to expect

"We want to onds a woman is raise the and rely on this raped," Redfield $15,000 [in donation." said. "In South anticipated Bend, these "Monologues" women and their 
Kaitlyn Redfield children need a

miracle happens at the 11th hour and people sud­denly become very generous or start buying tickets madly, this unfortunately won't happen," Redfield said. "Far more people will pay to attend 'The Vagina Monologues' than will likely attend this fundraiser, and we can only charge so much for ticket prices and auction items. But, any money is better than nothing." 
While the Red Rose Gala is primarily a fundraising event, Redfield and other event organ­izers hope it will help to raise awareness about some very important issues as well, she said. In addition to a live band, 
only locations 
available for 
them are the YWCA and S-0-S, and these organizations need our support to keep their doors open. As Catholics, as citizens of South Bend, and as members of the very privileged Notre Dame community, this is our responsi­bility." 
Tickets for the Gala are on sale all this week at the LaFortune Box Office. The cost is $15 for undergraduates, $25 for faculty and community members and $5 for the first 50 graduate students.

Professor's vvork set to 111ake vvorld pre111iere 
By NICOLE ZOOK Senior Staff Writer 
It's not every day Saint Mary's and Notre Dame studenl'> get the chance to witness a world pre­miere event, but starting tonight visitors to O'Laughlin Auditorium will do just that. 
"Witness," an opera based on the Karen Hesse novel of the same name, was written and con­ducted by Saint Mary's music pro­fessor Zae Muon. The opera's world premiere begins tonight at 7:30p.m. and is open to the pub­lic. 
Muon, who teaches music com­position, theory and orchestration at the College, said she is excited for the work to open and believes both students and South Bend residents have a lot to gain from viewing the opera. 
"I hope people will love the music, be thrilled by the story, and understand that it has real meaning for our lives today," she said. 
"Witness" tells the story of a Vermont town infiltrated by the Ku Klux Klan in 1924, focusing on the impact the group has on the lives of two young girls -one Jewish, one African-American. 
Muon said that the story is par­ticularly relevant in today's "polit­ical climate," and that the "both fascinating and frightening" coali­tions formed in the opera can "easily be seen" in America today. 
Muon also said the characters in the opera undergo profound changes and eventually come to know tolerance. 

"A central issue of the opera is how characters can change in the midst of a community crisis," she said. "[The entire community! emerges as a more tolerant and diverse community, a better com­munity." 
Muon's nine-scene opera ver­sion of "Witness" will feature a seven-musician orchestra, 20­voice chorus and eight lead vocal roles performed by Saint Mary's music students and singers from the community. 
Muon said Saint Mary's is a great environment for a world premiere opera. 
"A hugely important first step [in an opera's success] is to have this first set of performances and an excellent DVD which docu­ments the opera," Munn said. "Doug Boyer, the stage director, has contributed enormously to the likely survival of 'Witness,' because his stage pictures and dramatic vision have taken the music where it could not have gone on its own." 
While many students may fmd opera an inaccessible art form, Muon said her opera -written in English -is both accessible and relevant to young people today, and encouraged them to find out for themselves. 
"Opera really is much, much more than the music," she said.

Web01ail

orr organizational communica­
tions analyst James Cope said 
the reason for the slowness of e­
mail clients like Webmail is not 
an increase in e-mails sent and 
received but rather an increase 
in concurrent users -more 
people are logging on at the 
same time. 
"What has increased signifi­cantly is ... the number of con­nections to e-mail, so that the number of concurrent connec­tions -different people con­necting at the same time to email servers -has gone up 25 percent over the past year," Cope said. "It is a behavioral thing. People simply seem to be checking their email more fre­quently." 
Sophomore Dee Gulis said she cheeks her e-mail approximately 20 times a day, and sometimes it takes a few minutes to open. 
"Especially lately it's been really slow logging in and load­ing up messages," Gulis said. 
Webmail is the preferred e­mail client for students because it can ·be accessed at any com­puter connected to the Internet sinee it is a Web-based service. The Webmail system students usn today is about three years old. 
Moser said other factors have contributed to the slowing down of the e-mail dienl<> this semes­ter. More people have wireless capabilities on laptops or Personal Digital Assistants (PDA'i), so they can log onto their e-mail at any time, she said. 
Users also slow down the sys­tem by enabling an IMAP proto­col to store mail on the server so they can access it from any loca­tion at anytime. The system can become overwhelmed if users changn the preferences on their e-mail client to check for new messages less than every 10 minutes. 
Moser attributes the increase in daily usage to "the growing popularity of e-mail and wanting it instanta~eously, like Instant Messengt~r. 
OtT does have plans for improving e-mail serviee, Moser said. She hopes by next week they will begin to move the mail store to faster drives, a process that could take up to a week and a half. Moser said e-mail users should start to receive faster service in the middle of finals week. 
Over the summer, OIT admin­istrators will work on long-term changes and improvements to the system to keep up with the increasing demand, Moser said. 
English professor Dr. Noreen Deane-Moran uses Eudora to access her e-mail. This semester, she sometimes has waited up to 15 minutes before she can read a message. Deane-Moran men­tioned the delay to an orr employee in her building recent­
ly. 

"I said, 'You know I could read a novel in-between the time I click and when [the message] comes up,"' Deane-Moran said. 
Deane-Moran typically keeps her Eudora account open on her computer all day and notices her new messages open slowest between noon and four and at some hours during the night ­times when people are checking their e-mails in mass numbers. 
orr has prevented some usage problems this year by enabling a spam firewall to block junk mail from entering the inboxes of e­mail users. 
"If we did not have the spam controls that we have in place, the system would be totally over­whelmed," Cope said. "Fortunately we filter out a lot of the spam mail that comes through campus." 
Cope said though the e-mail clients must be improved to deal with the increasing usage of stu­dents and faculty, the system currently in place is still better at handling the communications needs of users than previous e­mail services. 
"We've gone from e-mail sys­tems that were routinely down to very highly reliable systems that from time to time may be a little bit sluggish because of the load, but are certainly for the most part available," Cope said.

Dissent 
continued from page 1 
regarding the pastoral role of a bishop and his relationship to a Catholic university, also said it is his responsibility "as a shepherd" to point out that Jenkins' decision requires more informed consider­ation. 
"Otherwise, our beloved Notre Dame will go down a road which it has always resisted traveling," he wrote. 
Rice, like D'Arcy, not only denounced the decision on the "Monologues" but also criticized Jenkins' rationale, writing that Jenkins "distorted the meaning of a Catholic university" with "per­sistent incoherence." 
On Thursday Rice told The Observer Jenkins' decision "destroyed his effectiveness as a president." He again said Jenkins should step down, leaving the decision for his replacement to the University Board ofTrustees. 
Rice's piece appeared two weeks after Father Wilson Miscamble's 1,500-word letter to the editor in the April 11 edition of The Observer said Jenkins "was asked to be courageous and set­tled for being popular." 
Miscamble said Thursday he received a stream of supportive responses from alumni after his letter was published. 
"[They were] broadly support­ive, [and] worried about the direc­tion of Notre Dame," Miscamble said. 
Miscamble, a history professor, wrote his letter "to alert our facul­ty, colleagues and our treasured students that not all members of the Congregation of Holy Cross, to which we belong, endorse [Jenkins'] decision." 
Another dissenting letter to the editor -this time by theology department chair John Cavadini -was published in the April 19 edition of The Observer. The next day, a letter to the editor was printed from Father John Coughlin, who said he was "stunned" by Jenkins' decision. 
Cavadini declined to comment to The Observer Wednesday, and Coughlin was unavailable for com­ment Thursday. 
Despite the consistent appear­ance of the dissenting letters to the editor, Rice said there was no coordination between the authors. His colleagues have said little in response to his piece, Rice said. 
Referring to John Paul II's 1999 papal document, Rice said the recent letters to the editor reflect a "studied reaction on the part of the people who have a concept of a Catholic university which is in accordance with Ex Corde Ecclesiae." 
Miscamble said he has spoken with priests on both sides of the issue about both his letter and Jenkins' statement. He said he feels he is most distinctly in the minority among Arts and Letters faculty and said their differing opinions stem from opposing views on how to best enhance the 

academic reputation of Notre Dame. 
"They LArts and Letters faculty in support of Jenkins' decision] are deeply worried about what they think a decision to restrict 'The Vagina Monologues' would mean for our academic reputa­tion," he said. 
But Miscamble sees it different­ly. He said not prohibiting the "Monologues" surrendered "our distinct identity and a great oppor­tunity to contribute to American higher education precisely because we are somewhat differ­ent because we are a religiously based institution." 
D'Arcy said he is not seeking control over Jenkins' decision­making. In his 21 years as bishop, he said he has never "interfered with [University] governance, and I have ·never required the University to adopt any particular policy, nor have I ever asked, required or demanded any partic­ular action of the University." 
But his statement added more weight to a growing opposition to campus events that dissenters say are inconsistent with Catholic teaching. 
"Notre Dame, with its vast resources. can do better than this," D'Arcy said. "I believe it will. Its responsibility to its students and to the position it has attained in higher education calls for it to do better."

China rate hike has global impact 
BEIJING -China's central bank raised interest rates Thursday in the govern­ment's strongest move yet to cool an econ­omy verging on overheating. The news sent resource stocks. oil and commodity prices lower around the world. 
The People's Bank of China raised the minimum rate banks charge on one-year loans in local currency, the yuan, 27 basis points, to 5.85 percent. The increase, which goes into effect Friday, was the first since October 2004 when the central bank raised the lending rate the same amount. 
Oil prices, which surged in recent months in part on growing demand from China, fell and shares of mining companies tum­bind as traders bet that the growing dPmand for copper. steel and other com­modities fueled by China's rapid expansion could slow.

Heplacing them were smiles, applause and construction workers wearing hard hats embla­zoned with the American flag, driving huge trucks down the World Trade Center site's ramp to start work on the Freedom Tower. 
New York and New Jersey's governors, Mayor Michael Bloomberg and developer Larry Silverstein, embroiled for months in a bitter bat­tle over control of buildings and money at the site, clapped and shook hands Thursday at a ceremonial start on the 1,776-foot skyscraper being built to replace the destroyed trade center. 

Libby's indictment not dismissed 
WASHINGTON -A federal judge refused Thursday to dismiss charges against I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, the former top White House aide who was indicted on peijury and obstruc­tion charges last year in the CIA leak scandal. 
In a 31-page opinion, U.S. District Judge Reggie B. Walton turned down a motion by lawyers for Vice President Dick Cheney's one­time top assistant, who challenged the authority of Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald to handle the case. 
Libby's lawyers had argued that Fitzgerald was given too much power and that the appoint­ment should have been made by the president with the Senate's approval.

Congress struggles with fuel 
Public anger over high gas prices causes leaders to take action in Washington 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON Congress considered bil­lions of dollars in new taxes on oil companies Thursday, looking for ways to punish the cash-rich industry and soothe grow­ing anger over high gaso­line prices. 
Senate Republicans also proposed a $100 fuel-cost rebate for millions of tax­payers, and Democrats talked of suspending the 18.4-cent federal gasoline tax for two months to ease Americans' pain at the pump. 
But even as lawmakers jockeyed for political advantage on the volatile issue, there was wide­spread agreement among economists and energy experts that the govern­ment has ~w if any weapons to quickly drive down gasoline prices that have rushed past $3 a gal­lon across much of the country. 
"Unfortunately there's nothing, really, that can be done that's going to affect energy prices or gasoline prices in the very short run," Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told a congressional hear­ing. 

Still, lawmakers scram­bled Thursday to put together legislative pack­antacids under the strain of imposing $4.3 billion in ers $100 checks.

McClatchy sells papers to MediaNews 
NEW YORK -Six weeks after announcing a deal to buy the nation's second-largest news­paper company, McClatchy Co. has agreed to sell four Knight Ridder Inc. newspapers to MediaNews Group Inc. for $1 billion. 
The four papers -three in California and one in Minnesota -are among 12 that McClatchy has said it intends to sell because they don't meet its acquisition criteria, which include being located in rapidly growing mar­kets. Still to be sold are eight other papers, including The News-Sentinel in Fort Wayne, Ind. 
The deal announced Wednesday increases the profile and reach of MediaNews, a pri­vately held company based in Denver and run by William Dean Singleton. With financial backing from Hearst Corp., another newspa­per publisher, MediaNews will wind up own­ing the San Jose Mercury News, the Contra Costa Times, the Monterey County Herald and the St. Paul Pioneer Press. 

Experts say Macs are prone to risks 
SAN FRANCISCO -Benjamin Daines was browsing the Web when he clicked on a series of links that promised pictures of an unreleased update to his computer's operating system. 
Instead, a window opened on the screen and strange commands ran as if the machine was under the control of someone -or something ­else. 
Daines was the victim of a computer virus. 
Such headaches are hardly unusual on PCs running Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system. Daines, however, was using a Mac -an Apple Computer Inc. machine often touted as being immune to such risks. 
He and at least one other person who clicked on the links were infected by what security exports call the first-ever virus for Mac OS X, the operating system that has shipped with every Mac sold since 2001 and has survived virtually unscathed from the onslaught of malware unleashed on the Internet in recent years. 
"It just shows people that no matter what kind of computer you use you are still open to some level of attack," said Daines, a 29-year-old British chemical engineer who once considered Macs invulnerable to such attacks.

Pause in rate increases ahead 
Bernanke's comment causes an optimistic attitude as stocks close mostly higher 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK -Stocks closed mostly higher Thursday as Wall Street brushed aside concerns about a Chinese interest rate hike to focus on comments by Federal Heserve Chairman Ben Bernanke that a pause in U.S. rate increases may be ahead. 
In trading pushed and pulled by the cross currents of earnings reports, fluctuat­ing energy prices and inter­national events, Bernanke's commenl'i overrode all other distractions, analysts said. 
"What he's coming through very clearly and saying is we will probably pause soon but don't assume we're done because we pause.... But I think the market is just reacting to 'Hey, hey, Ben said we might be done soon'," said Jeff Kleintop, chief investment strategist for PNC Wealth Management. "Whenever you take a little uncertainty out of the picture, well, the market is going to like that." 
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 28.02, or 0.3 percent, to close at 11,382.51. 

Broader stock indicators also moved higher. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 4.31, or 0.3 percent, to 1,309.72, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 11.32, or 0.5 percent, to 2,344.95. barrel on the New York energy prices could jeopard­preclude actions at subse­

out shelter. 
Entertainment provided by Notre Dame's chapter of Habitat for Humanity will encourage fellowship among participants. 
lafigliola explained the hope for the future inherent in the event. 
"Students at Notre Dame are going to become doctors, busi­ness executives, politicians, and other leaders of the future," Iafigliola said. "If we can plant a seed with these leaders of tomorrow, then we are one step closer to our goal. But we also hope they can see that there's so much they can do today." 
Fuller's participation in Notre Dame's Shack City 2006 makes this year's event even more highly anticipated than it has been in years past. Fuller founded Habitat for Humanity in 1976 with his wife, linda. He is a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. 
"Millard Fuller has traveled literally around the world to inspire thousands of Habitat volunteers, packing churches and auditoriums everywhere he goes," Iafigliola said. "In January, when I invited him to our campus chapter's event, he was immediately excited about the possibility. We actually chose the weekend for Shack City based on when he could visit." 
Iafigliola encouraged stu­dents to go hear Fuller speak, no matter what their interests or inspirations. 
"Fuller is a unique and remarkable mix of entrepre­neurial genius, social-action visionary and passionate man of faith," he said. "It has always been his Christian faith that has inspired him. Literally every­one has reason to go hear him." 
Habitat for Humanity is based upon what Fuller has described as "the economics of Jesus." Habitat's no-profit, no-interest economic philosophy stems from Exodus 22:25, which calls those lending money to the poor to neither charge interest nor act as creditors. Habitat homeowners are partners in the Habitat homebuilding process. They typically invest 500 sweat-equity hours into their home and then pay for the cost of the home at no profit and no interest. 
About 200 people have already registered online for Shack City, and walk up regis­tration will be allowed on Saturday evening, Iafigliola said. Everyone is invited and encouraged to come hear Fuller speak, even if they can­not participate in the camp-out. 
Habitat is currently a little over $1,000 shy of its $5,000 fundraising goal and is asking Shack City participants to obtain a minimum of $5 in pledges to support its cause. 
"Fighting poverty takes per­sonal sacrifice, but that doesn't mean it can't be fun and rewarding -just ask anyone who's ever worked on a Habitat house project," Iafigliola said. "I hope Shack City is not an end, but rather a spark for serving others. Let's not just talk about fighting poverty ­grab a hammer. But first ... let's sleep on it." 
Shack City is just one of sev­eral Habitat sponsored events this week. The successful Keenan-Habitat Muddy Sunday Volleyball Tournament held last weekend served as a kickoff for the week. The official dedica­tion of the 12th student Habitat house and a year-end celebra­tory luncheon with some of Habitat's supporters will con­clude the week of advocacy and action.

includes $1,500,000 to establish an endowment fund to assist with future operating costs of the building. McDonald said alumna Jennifer Mathile Prikkel and the Mathile family are the primary donors for the project -Prikkel and her family's donations total $6,000,000 -but construction will not begin until "100 percent of the project costs are committed through charitable gifts," she said. 
The building, which will be located east of the Science Hall and north of Madeleva Hall, was designed by Ballinger Architects of Philadelphia and the Architecture Design Group (ADG, Inc.) of South Bend. ADG, Inc. also designed the Noble Family Dining Hall and the Student Center. 
Junior Johnnie Quigley said she had concerns with the location of the building, but also said she understood there were limited possibilities for building sites. 
"The building looks really gor­geous," she said. "I wish it~ could have been built sooner, however, so I could have used it." 
While she was disappointed she wouldn't be able to have class in the new building, Quigley said she thought it would benefit enroll­ment at the College. 
''I'm excited to see it go up," she said. "I think it will bring more people to campus." 
Architect Jed Eide said the building "is designed to look like a new building, but one that blends in with the best existing architecture at Saint Mary's." 
The exterior of the building will be a combination of brick and limestone, similar to Le Mans Hall in color, have pitched slate roofs and "a lot of glass-particularly on the south side to let natural light penetrate deep into the building in the winter," Eide said.

Worker conditions need greater attention 
A little more than a week after Executive Vice President John Affleck-Graves issued a statement that denied the Campus Labor Action Project's recommendation to institute a task force to examine Notre Dame's labor policies and reaf­firmed the University's current employment policies, many workers are still dissatisfied. 
It was an explanatory statement from the University -but not enough. 
Workers told The Observer that many of Affleck-Graves' arguments -that the University already pays a "fair and just wage," that workers receive substantial benefit and insurance packages ' -just don't hold O Th

While this may be, the issue is not so simple. Graves' emphasis that dialogue regarding cam­

Editorial 
wage for campus workers to $12.10 are sub­stantial. 
It is a fundamental tenet of economics that raising the mini­mum wage will create higher unemployment in the long run. The lowest wages at this University may seem like a trivial percentage of' the budget, but they are a percentage. It is easy to imagine the administration spending extra money on hiring more professors for smaller class sizes rather than more cleaning staff for cleaner buildings. By raising the campus wage, Notre Dame could be forced to decide where its priori­ties lie. 
Yes, the trade-ofTs the University would face represent only a basic economic argument. And yes, there are more complex factors involved. It certainly docs not imply that raising the wage isn't worthy of serious consideration. Other prominent universities, such as Harvard, Georgetown and Washington University in St. Louis, have raised wages for campus work­ers. 
CLAP has been working to raise awareness of its cause for most of this semester. After continued demands that .Jenkins issue a public statement in support of a living wage, the group submitted an 11-page report to .Jenkins, Provost Thomas Burish, Aflleck-Graves and Vice President for Student Affairs Father Mark Poorman on March R. Aflleck-Graves' response came April 19 -more than a month later. Until recently, the University has been relatively quiet regarding the issue. The response has been inadequate. 
Notre Dame is a Catholic university. Furthermore, it is a uni­
versity that prides itself on its efforts -espe­
cially the efforts of its students -to promotn 
social justice around the world. So Affleck­
University and its workers -not students -is 
nothing less than jarring. By implying that stu­dents should not be concerned with the employment condi­tions of the workers who serve this community daily, the University undermines much of' what it stands for. 
The wage issue is far from straightforward, a complexity­laden argument that must take a multitude of' factors into con­sideration. One thing is clear, however -no University employee should ever work in fear. 
That mentality. Aflleck-Graves said, is "deeply disturbing." But just because the thought is disturbing doesn't mean the University can ignore the large number of workers who fear reprisal if' they speak up against their employers -a genuine fear that deterred many of them from speaking to The Observer this week. 
It's not just wages. It's about respect-respeet for the work­ers, respect for the students and, most of all, respect lilr Notre Dame.

Thanks for the lllelllories 
This is my last column. Lately, I have heard the word "last" thrown around quite a bit. For the most part, it always seems to invoke feelings of sadness, and I don't want to make this a sad article. The last two years I have spent writing for The Observer have been nothing but a great joy, so I don't plan on getting down on myself now. 
Being named a columnist was a huge honor for me. Initially, I was sur­prised to get so much positive feed­back -now I am very grateful for all the support I have received. It is always exciting when someone recognizes your name and says they enjoy your column. It is quite flattering to know that I actually have some readership. Most of the letters I received were either those thanking me for what I wrote, those telling me they enjoyed my humor or alums remi­niscing. Additionally, every week I also received a number of invitations to parties and request for dates. 
Of course, like any journalist, I have also received some negative respons­es. My "hate mail," as I refer to it, has come mostly from disgruntled Cubs fans and some people who dislike the lighthearted nature of my topics. I cannot say I completely disagree with these people because this has been quite true. I never wrote about "The Vagina Monologues," the Queer Film Festival or the 2004 elections because

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Agree to CLAP 
In response to a rise in student action, the University recently released a statement on the living wage which, unsurpisingly, failed to provide a moral rationale for the share of Notre Dame workers who continue to live in poverty. It also included two misleading state­ments. 
In it they claim: "Notre Dame has long recognized the right of our employees to unionize if they wish." The fact is that the last time work­ers tried to form a union the University was found guilty of ille­gal anti-union activity by the National Labor Relations Board in 1978. 
A second claim is that "The aver­age salary of our service employees is 15 percent above the market." In fact, the gap between low and high paid workers at Notre Dame has been increasing. While national wages for low-income workers are ten percent above those in 1979, those for top quartile of income earners have increased by fil'ty per­cent (Economic Policy Institute). The market is creating a large and growing gap between the working poor and rich, does Notre Dame want to follow its lead? 
The University maintains that its system of wages is just, but does not provide a legitimate moral argument to support the idea that it should be spending $50 million on a new building, paying top-adminis­trators $300,000, or maintaining a $2-3 billion endowment, while workers are living at or near the poverty level. Notre Dame workers should be paid enough for their family to be above the poverty level, and more critically enough to pro­vide them with the dignity and recognition that they deserve. 
We deserve a public dialogue on why University President Father John Jenkins is making $300,000 while other workers make $20,000 or less. Is this level of economic inequality and poverty acceptable for a Catholic university? 
Stafl", students and faculty should be outraged. The administration should disclose statistics on how wages and economic inequality have changed at Notre Dame for the past thirty years. It should take action to remedy this injustice by agreeing to the demands of the Campus Labor Action Project.

Response to 'no one true faith' 
In response to Mr. Ronderos' article "There is no one true faith" (April 25): 
I would like to begin by stating two compli­mentary principles which we both agree upon quite strongly: the beliefs that "truth is present in all religions" and that "human logic can never completely comprehend or understand the divine." Any one individual has an extremely limited perspective; thus, in seeking truth, we must look beyond our own custom­ary ways of thinking. The metaphor that George Weigel attributes to Pope John Paul II sums it up perfectly -truth is best found as if ascending upon a spiral staircase, walking around an issue from numerous perspectives and taking what is good from each. 
Ronderos proceeds from here to conclude that each individual should develop his or her own unique "fusion of religious ideas." I dis­agree for two main reasons, both of which fol­low directly from our shared beliefs stated above. 
First of all, by taking such an individualistic stance, one ends up undercutting one's com­mitment to real, ongoing dialogue. Ronderos suggests that each individual should take what he or she happens to like from each tradition: the problem is that, were each to do this, there would soon no longer be any traditions. Rather, there would merely be many individu­als with different beliefs, and with no better standard for holding their particular set than simple personal preference. C.S. Lewis likens the continuity which a tradition provides to the ownership of a set of good maps, made by hundreds of sailors who have gone before you. The "personal," "empirical" experience of tak­ing a walk on the beach may be quite fulfilling, in the moment-but you will never get any­where unless you put out to sea with a set of trustworthy maps. Thus a commitment to engaging deeply with the views of others means not merely conversation and explo­ration, but above all entering into a committed, shared life within an ongoing faith tradition. 
Furthermore, we agree that the Divine is inexpressibly above the human: which implies that we can never attain to God by our own efforts; rather, God must come to us. Hence we must look to Revelation of some sort. And though Ronderos mentions "great sages," there is one religious founder to whom that term glaringly does not apply. As both The Everlasting Man and Mere Christianity argue convincingly, Jesus simply cannot be consid­ered a "wise man," equivalent to Confucius or the Buddha. The "Lord, liar, or lunatic," argu­ment may be commonplace, but that does not make it unsound. 
I wish Ronderos the very best in his search for truth; as you graduate from Notre Dame, please bear in mind that He who said "seek and you shall find" also said "I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. No one comes to the Father except through me." 
Brian Boyd sophomore Keough Hall April27 


Rice's critique unfair 
Professor Emeritus Charles Rice expressed passionate and personal vehemence in his April 25 column about University President Father John Jenkins' closing statement ("Jenkins' statement a serious misstep"). That is unfortu­nate for two reasons. First, Jenkins may be the first University president in memory to publicly solicit input from the two principal constituen­cies -students and faculty -on a matter of important concern. And that would include the presidencies of Fathers John Cavanaugh, Theodore Hesburgh and Edward Malloy ­more than 60 years. 
Second, the Catholicity of the University is not so fragile that presentation of a play will weak­en its fabric, even a play replete with vulgarities and crudities. To establish our resolve to the concept of academic freedom, it should not be necessary to dance to the tune of author Eve Ensler's "The Vagina Monologues." Ensler does­n't have a franchise on fighting violence against women. Nor is it necessary to placate those fac­ulty fascinated by seeing the University strug­gling on this issue. 
Rice will never win the award for gentility of expression. His indictment of Jenkins includes such accusative phrases as having "ignored the substantive effects," "fell for the lie" and con­firming "that political correctness is the opera­tive official religion of Notre Dame." Rice fur­ther suggests Jenkins will be responsible for "creation of a diverse and predictably useless committee to discuss things" from which will emerge a "fig leaf to cover an accommodation to the relativist, homosexual culture." 
With these attacks, Rice moves beyond advo­cacy to assassination of his target when he writes that Jenkins has "distorted the meaning of a Catholic university" and "did it all with per­sistent incoherence." 
Rice concludes by saying that Father Jenkins should resign or be removed, noting these alter­natives involve "no animosity or disrespect toward Jenkins." We can only wonder how Rice would thunder against someone he disrespects and bears animosity toward. 
Surely it is unusual for a faculty member, cur­rent or emeritus, to declaim so stridently and so personally toward a University president. The tone is one of disparagement. The heat of the peroration suggests anger. This may not have been one of Rice's best case presentations. Father Bill Miscamble's letter on the same issue ("An open letter to Father John Jenkins," April 
11) was very direct but well within the bounds of civil discourse. 
The issue has left our Bishop saddened and Rice apoplectic. But the University and Jenkins will persist. Academic freedom at Notre Dame will endure and adherence and devotion to our Catholic faith will not be abridged in the least. And Jenkins will serve long and well as Notre Dame's president. 
Robert 0. Murphy alumnus Class of'51 April25 


Rice defends vvrong rights 
Reading Professor Emeritus Rice's scatologi­cal op-ed piece ("Jenkins' statement a serious misstep"), I was left wondering when did one's personal religious beliefs become a warrant for hatred, homophobia and contempt of dif­ference? His egregious refusal to understand ways of life other than his own is his own busi­ness, but to claim that the portrayal of women's lives in "The Vagina Monologues" or those of lesbians and gay men in the Queer Film Festival must necessarily be anti-Catholic is ridiculous. Can Rice not conceive that, in a plural and secular society, lives take place out­side the ambit of his own limited social com­prehension? His evident failure to recognize the value of gay men and lesbians, and of women secure in their non-Catholic identities, reveals the arrogance of the reactionary right, who seem to think they talk to God on the phone daily. Rice's article is another example of the special rights claimed by religious zealots worldwide -the right to intolerance. 
Todd Nathan Thorpe grad student April26 



Open letter to Jenkins 
As an alumnus of the University of Notre Dame with two masters degrees-commu­nication arts and theology -I am extremely disappointed in you and your recent sophomoric decision concerning academic freedom and Catholic character. 
You unfortunately surren­dered good academic reasoning for the more popular phony logic. You confused academic freedom with academic licen­tiousness. 
I join Bishop John D'Arcy and others in denouncing your unsatisfactory decision. 
Please change your mind and decision.

Re-open senior week 
I am writing to address Kelly Meehan's article "'Senior Week' events not open to all seniors" appearing in April 25th's Observer. As a current fifth-year senior, I found several aspects of this article very puzzling. First, if the Senior Class Council insists that students can only celebrate senior week the year that they graduate, then how come not one of the fifth-year students I know, including myself, has been invit­ed to participate in this year's senior week? Second, and more important, Anna Skoien is quoted as saying that "Regardless of if [a student) entered as the Class of 2006, the University's policy is if [a student] does not graduate in May they cannot participate in Senior Week." Not only is this a terrible policy, but it also seems to be a recently invented one. 
Despite being a "non-graduat­ing senior" last year, I was invit­ed to all of last year's senior week activities, attended several of them, and was allowed to remain in my dorm for that week. I also knew fourth-year architecture students, both last year and the year before, who were able to do the same. This seemed natural to me; I consider myself a member of the class of 2005, I appeared in the 2005 yearbook, and I plan on attend­ing reunions with the class of 2005. The students who graduat­ed last year were my roommates, my lab partners, those random people I still remember from Frosh-0, and my best friends. Every fifth-year student I have talked to -whether architec­ture, dual-degree, double major or just taking his time -agrees that the class they entered with is the class that they identify with. 
So why the sudden appearance of this restricting "University pol­icy?" I would encourage the Senior Class Council to stand up for those fourth-year architec­ture students and other non­graduating seniors, and in the meantime don't forget about the fifth-year students either. Let all seniors celebrate four great years with their friends on senior week.

MUSIC SPOTLIGHT 
The ten finest albums of the semester 
By JOE LATTAL 
Scene Critic 
WVFI Station Manager Joe Latta! selnets tho Notre Damn Wnb radio sta­tion's ehoicns for best albums of the semester, a list that highlights the top independent and mainstream discs that have been relnased this year. 
The list was compiled from the best discs that arrived at the station in the past four months. While it includes sev­eral familiar faees, it also has its share of relatively new aets, some of whom have performed at Notre Dame. 
Belle and Sebastian, "The Life Pursuit" 
WVFJ's favorite group from Scotland just wrapped up a suecessful tour with Matador Heeords friends New Pornographers. Belle and Sebastian relnased "The Life Pursuit" just nine months after "Push the Barman to Open Old Wounds," proving that they are as energetie as ever. But where does "Life Pursuit" rank among some of the band's dassics sueh as "The Boy With the Arab Strap" and "If You're Feeling Sinister?" Every fan will disagree if this is their best. hut what is certain is that this was the best CD to hit WVFI over the last four months. 
Mates of State, "Bring It Back" 
Having achieved great success with its last LP, Team Boo, the keyboard-drums duo has done it again. With this album. listeners are treated to a more mature Mates of State that is not afraid to ven­ture forth from its staked claim on the pop map into a more varied territory.

Jenny Lewis's solo project would sound like, and the result was more than agreeable. Featuring Conor Oberst (Bright Eyes), Ben Gibbard (from Death Cab For Cutie and The Postal Service) and other talent, "Habbit Fur Coat" is the complete pack­age -full of more laidback, Rilo Kiley tunes, some upbeat material and the alt­country single of the year so far, "Rise Up With Fists!" 
The album has been extremely popular 

and well-received and has stayed in WVFI's top ten for nearly two months. 
Margot and the Nuclear So and So's, "Dust of Retreat" 
When Margot played Legends in September as the opening act for Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, the Indianapolis band immediately made a fan out of the 500 audience members. Since that per­formance, the band has earned numer­ous praises for its successful debut album. Not only did the band execute in the live setting, but the studio album also offers solid indie rock, adeptly com­

Side" 

Austin's "I Love You But I've Chosen Darkness" debut CD climbed for eight straight weeks on CMJ's Hadio 200 chart. The opening track, "The Ghost," sets the tone for the entire album. The music slowly swims through gentle chord progressions until the terrorizing rhythm guitars and per­cussion enter. The song drifts into a cli­mactic chorus that escapes and returns liberally. Like the rest of the album. "The Ghost" is the most mysterious pop music listeners have heard since Interpol's "Turn on the Bright Lights" and almost as strong. 
Yeah Yeah Yeahs, "Show Your Bones" 
Karen 0 and the gang faced lots of pressure after the successful garage punk "Fever to Tell." The New York band took a different direction with "Show Your Bones," 
sion, which comes out clearly in the single "Gold Lion" as well as other tracks such as 
"Phenomena" and "Way Out." The risky move proved successful as the band added other styles to its songwriting besides going all out with screams and distortion. 
Islands, "Return to the Sea" 
After the explosion and subsequent dissolution of the Canadian Independent stars The Unicorns, two members con­tinued on together to form Islands. While this new project is clearly influenced by the former band, it has a sound that is more mature and altogether its own. Including complex melodies with a sharp pop sensibility, a significantly darker overall tone and even a bit of hip-hop, this new formation is sure to please new and old fans alike. 
Destroyer, "Destroyer's Rubies" 
Opening with an epic title track that clocks in just shy of ten minutes, Dan Bejar's (aka Destroyer) latest effort, "Destroyer's Rubies," is a nearly flawless album. 
on his previous discs. 
Bejar, who is also a member of the critically acclaimed band New Pornographers, has been making solo projects through this moniker for several years and through several albums. "Rubies," by far his most cohe­sive album, is easily one of the best discs of 2006 thus far. 
The Strokes, "First Impressions of Earth" 
The Strokes reaffirmed themselves with their latest album -possibly their strongest release ever -which came out in the first week of the year. Julian Casablancas' vocals were clearer and more comprehensible than ever before, guitarists Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond Jr. finally showed off their tal­ent, bassist Nikolai Fraiture showed some personality, and Fabrizio Moretti's percussion was heavier than ever. 
With a more appropriate running time than their previous work and more dili­gent songwriting, the Strokes finally pro­duced what fans have really been wait­ing for -a satisfying album from begin­ning to end. 
Morrissey, "Ringleader of the Tormentors" 
When Morrissey isn't busy condemning entire nations or penning press releases. he actually makes fairly good music. "Ringleader" features more rocking tunes than Morrissey's last release, "You Are the Quarry." As always, his elegant voice shimmers whether he is pulling for romantic or aggressive effects. Morrissey's undying eloquence makes the typical rock star look like Wesley Willis.

Originally written in 1888 by Eduard Scarpetta. the famous Italian comedic acto and master of the slapstick farce, the stor was made into a film featuring the youn Sophia Loren in 1954. 
The tales chronicle life with the likabl scatterbrain, Felice Sciosciammocca. As a: impoverished and unemployed man, Fefic, is convinced to masquerade with the rest o his family as nobility.

Promising payment, Eugenio requests of Felice that he and his family pose as Eugenio's relatives in order to get Gemma's family's approval for a marriage. Felice accepts the proposal and proceeds to don both the attire as well as the attitude of a noble.

The cast includes Michael Subialka (Felice), Jenna Olson (Louisella), Derrick Testa (Eugenio), Patricia Alvarez (Gemma} and Jason Wittenbach (Gaetano}. 
Overall, every cast member gives a very respectable performance. The fact that the play is performed entirely in Italian only adds to the impressive and admirable act­ing. 
The language is perhaps what is most interesting and most remarkable about the show. After all, most of the cast members only began studying Italian upon beginning their undergraduate careers at Notre Dame. With only a handful of semesters of Italian under most of their belts, the stu­dents deliver a very professional high-qual­ity performance. Their speech is fluid, and their accents well developed -in short, it is far better than to be expected from stu­dents who have taken only a few semesters of the language. For audience members familiar with Italian, the performance is only that much more enjoyable. 
But that's not to say that the play is 
meant only for 
those who have 
to have no 
knowledge of the Italian language and attend the perform­ance. 
The characters are incredibly animated, gesture a great deal and convey the events of the play through not only their words but also their body language -making the show something that everyone can truly enjoy. 
Miseria e Nobilta' will be performed twice both days of its scheduled run. Shows are set to begin at 6pm and then again at 9pm on Friday and Saturday. Tickets are $7 for faculty and staff, $7 for seniors and $5 for all students.

Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Barry Bonds will have to wait until he passes Hank Aaron before baseball throws a party for him. 
Major League Baseball is not planning any celebra­tion for Bonds if and when he tops Babe Ruth's mark of 714 home runs, commis­sioner Bud Selig said Thursday. 
"Hank Aaron broke Babe Ruth's record," Selig said. "We don't celebrate 1UlY­body the second or third time in." 
Bonds has been the sub­ject of steroids speculation for several seasons. The recent book "Game of Shadows" detailed allega­tions against him, and a federal grand jury is inves­tigating whether he com­mitted perjury when he told another grand jury that he had never know­ingly used performance­enhancing drugs. 
Bonds hit his 711 th homer Wednesday. His San Francisco Giants were off Thursday, and open a three-game series Friday night at home against Arizona. 
Selig does not figure to be in San Francisco or in Milwaukee or Philadelphia, where the Giants play next week as Bonds nears Ruth . 
"We celebrate new records, that's what we do. We're being consistent," Selig said during the Associated Press Sports Editors annual meeting with league commission­ers. "There's nothing to read into that." 
Ruth is second on the career home run list, trail­ing Aaron's total of 755. When Aaron broke Ruth's record in 1974, commis­sioner Bowie Kuhn was not in attendance. Kuhn's absence rankled many, including Aaron. 
Bonds has been hobbled by bad knees, and missed most of last season. 
IN BRIEF 

Duke accuser previously
reported rape 
DURHAM, N.C.-The woman who says she was raped by three members of Duke's lacrosse team also told police 10 years ago she was raped by three men, filing a 1996 complaint claiming she had been assaulted three years earlier when she was 14. 
Authorities in nearby Granville County said Thursday that none of the men named in the decade-old report were ever charged with sexual assault there, but they didn't have details why. 
A phone number for the accuser has been disconnected and her family declined to comment to The Associated Press. But relatives told Essence magazine in an online story this week that the woman declined to pursue the case out of fear for her safety. 
The existence of the report sur­prised defense attorneys, one of whom has sought information about the accuser's past for use in attacking her credibility. 
Canadiens fall to 
Hurricanes 
MONTREAL -Carolina felt like it finally caught a few breaks and the Hurricanes can only hope they came soon enough to get their playoff run back on track. 
Eric Staal scored a power-play goal 
3:38 into overtime Wednesday night to give Carolina a 2-1 victory over the Montreal Canadiens as the Hurricanes avoided falling into an 0-3 hole in their first-round playoff series. 
Montreal's Tomas Plekanec was sent off for hooking 2:35 irito overtime and Staal won it with a drive from the point that went through traffic and past goalie Cristobal Huet. 
Huet said he lost sight of the puck and knew it was bad news when the raucous Bell Centre crowd of 21,273 suddenly went silent. 
"We needed the win," Staal said. "I didn't get as much wood on it as I would have liked, but I found the back of the net with a good screen in front." 
"He's had a remarkable career. Whatever happens, happens," Selig said. "We're going to let nature take its course. Commissioners don't sit around and say, 'I hope this guy breaks it or not."' 
Selig said he had read "Game of Shadows" but not seen "Bonds on Bonds," the ESPN reality show about the slugger's life. 
Selig said the book was among several factors that prompted him to launch a baseball investigation into steroids, headed by former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell. There is no timetable for complet­ing the probe. 

NFL draft still holds 
uncertainties 
NEW YORK -Two days before the NFL draft, even the players who will be picked at the top are tired of listen­ing to the chatter and reading the gos­sip. 
In other words, just get on with it. 
"There's so much uncertainty I don't even pay attention to what they're say­ing anymore," Southern Cal quarter­back Matt Leinart, the 2004 Heisman Trophy winner, said Thursday during an NFL-sponsored media session for six of the top prospective draftees. Those players have spent the last few days in New York at similar events leading up to Saturday's lottery at Radio City Music Hall. 
"I don't want to watch television. I don't want to look at mock drafts. I just want it to happen." 
Of all the top picks and there's a general consensus on the top 10 or 12, Leinart seems to be the one sliding in the final days, although no one is sure why.

MEN'S lACROSSE 

Irish, Buckeyes set to square off in conference contest 
By TIM DOUGHERTY Sports Writer 
No. 15 Notre Dame (8-4, 1-2 
CWLL) hopes to spoil Ohio 
State's bid for a share of the 
Creat Western Lacrosse League 
championship when the two 
premier Midwest programs 
renew their longstanding rival­
ry Saturday at 3 p.m. at Moose 
Krause Stadium. 
The Buckeyes helped keep the Irish out of the NCAA tour­nament in 2003 and 2004 with midseason victories that ulti­mately proved fatal to the Irish, as Ohio State (6-5, 3-1) repre­sented the GWLL in the post­season. 
But last year Notre Dame returned the favor, stunning the Buckeyes 16-5 in Columbus in the season finale for the Irish -knocking Ohio State out of a share for the league lead. 
An Ohio State win would put them in a position to tie Denver (11-4, 4-0) for the league championship if the Pioneers should falter Saturday against Air Force in Colorado Springs. 
Irish senior co-captain defenseman D.J. Driscoll said if Notre Dame is to play the role of spoiler again, it will need all the fight it can bring to tackle the physical game the Buckeyes will bring with them to South Bend. 
"Since freshman year, [Notre Dame-Ohio State games have] always been a dogfight," Driscoll said. "Tough games, hard-nosed games. They are just big athletic kids who come for you and you have to be ready for it." 
Irish coach Kevin Corrigan said Ohio State's rugged athleti-

cism is the team's biggest strength -and one which Notre Dame will have to over­come both on offense and defense. 
"It makes them an effective full-field team that they have to defend because they get up and down," Corrigan said. "They ride hard, and they clear well. They're strong on both ends of the field. 
"Because of the fact that you have to defend the whole field and they can create situations across the whole field, there's pressure from them, so we'll have to be vigilant in our deci­sion making and what we're doing." 
The physical challenge Ohio State presents ensures Notre Dame's GWLL-best .717 goals per game scoring defense must play hard-nosed determined lacrosse Saturday. The Irish effort should be in no short supply, as they face-off against one of their biggest rivals for the 25th time in the 25 years with the series history on the line, tied 12-12 since the 1983 campaign -the first season Notre Dame fielded a lacrosse team. 
Although Notre Dame has taken four of the past seven, the seniors must win Saturday to tie the series for their careers. 
"Certainly the names Notre Dame and Ohio State [stand out]." Corrigan said. "If our seniors win this game they'll even the series during their time at 2-2. There aren't many teams we have a losing record against during their four years. We definitely look at Ohio State as one of our biggest rivals, because of the proximity, the 

league and the history of our 
two schools." 
In light of the added implica­tions of the rivalry match-up, Corrigan is doing his best to keep the Irish enthusiasm from boiling over before the teams face-off Saturday. 
"There are different emotion­al things going on each week," he said, "but the trick is not to get caught up too much emo­tionally in [rivalry] games.. You have to show up ready to exe­cute in what we do. Consistency is important." 
The match-up has special sig­nificance for Driscoll, who chose to attend Notre Dame over Ohio State four years ago. He is excited about the intensi­ty the game brings out between the two teams. 
"It will be tough but it will also be fun at the same time," he said. "It's real energetic and get your emotions in it. ... I look forward to the game Saturday." 
Driscoll remembers clearly last year's route of Ohio State. But he also remembers Notre Dame's 12-11 loss to Fairfield last season that dashed the team's postseason hopes. He thinks the Irish are again more committed than ever to make their last games their best ­regardless of whether or not they come in the tournament. 
"We still have gotten pretty energetic practices coming in," he said. "People have been coming in and working harder than they have all year in prac­tice and hopefully that carries over." 
Driscoll said Corrigan has forced the Irish to forget about their losses and focus on the present to prepare for their last

contests against Ohio State and Quinnipiac (6-5, 0-3). 
"Everyone is just taking it one day at a time," Driscoll said. "We're going out there and enjoying each practice, getting the most out of each person." 
Senior attack Pat Walsh has been the exception to that rule, as he missed two days of prac­tice this week with a viral infection lingering from Sunday's 10-7 win against Lehigh (8-6, 4-2 Patriot League). During the game, Walsh scored three of his four goals to lead the Irish fourth quarter surge 4-1. But Corrigan has no concerns about Walsh's time off during the week as long as he's able to play this weekend. 
"This time of year, missing a day of practice is going to hurt a guy like Pat," Corrigan said. ''I'm not worried about the effects of him missing a prac­tice. I'm worried about him get­ting himself healthy and ready for the weekend." 
Walsh has sounded progres­sively better throughout the week, and regardless of how well he feels, he said he will be on the field Saturday to face the Irish rival. 
"I played through it Sunday," he said. "And if I need to, I will again."

TeaiTI sends athletes to tvvo co1npetitions 
By FRAN TOLAN Sports Writer 
With several important compe­titions looming in the next few weeks, Notre Dame will send portions of iL'i team to compete in both thn Hillsdale "Gina" Helays and the Drake Helays Friday and Saturday. 
A week before the Big East Championships, several Irish athletes are looking to post quali­fying marks for the conference meet. 
"This weekend, we want a few more athletes to qualify [for the Big East]," sprinters eoaeh John Millar said. "Those who have qualified already might just need to get a lighter workout in." 
The "Gina" Relays, hosted by llillsdale College in Michigan, will feature approximately 30 Notrn Dame athletes. 
"We should be able to get some good preparation in for next weekfmd," Millar said of the event. 
The Irish will also send run­ners to the Drake Relays in Des Moines, Iowa. Hosted by Drake University, Millar called the event "one of the biggest meets in the country." 
"The only reason we don't send more athletes [to the Drake Relays] is because we have the Big East next weekend," Millar said. 
The Irish will be well repre­sented in Iowa. The men's 4x1600, 4x800 and 4x400 relay teams will compete, along with throwers Caret Koxlien and Kyle Annen. 
After adding four NCAA quali­fYing marks to their record last weekend at the Central Collegiate Championship and Oregon Invitational, the Irish are also looking forward to the NCAA Regionals, to be held May 26-27 in Knoxville, Tenn.

Irish return hotne to face Orange 
By ERIC RETTER Associate Sports Editor 
After a month on the road, No. 7 Notre Dame returns home for its final Big East game against No. 13 Syracuse Saturday at noon. 
The Irish (11-3, 3-1 Big East) last played at home March 25, drubbing Canisius 18-2, and since have compiled a 3-2 record away from Moose Krause Stadium -induding back-to­hack 11-10 losses to No. 2 Duke and No. 3 Georgetown. 
The team is looking forward to finally stepping out onto its home turf after the East Coast swing. 
"It feels great," Notre Dame coach Tracy Coyne said. "I think that its great to be at home, especially since we're heading into a more difficult academic time so it's just good to have the consistency of not having to worry about packing again for another away trip." 
Notre Dame will be led by sen­ior attack Crysti Foote, the only similarly potent squad in Irish player to ever score more Syracuse, which operates an up­than 200 career points and a tempo attack. finalist for the Tewaarton Trophy "They like to run and they're recognizing the best women's very athletic," Coyne said.

Matsui breaks out of slump, leads Yankees over Devil Rays 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Gary Sheffield drove the ball to deep left-cen­ter in the first inning. It was headed over the wall for a two­run homer, until Joey Gathright sprinted over from center, leaped and pulled the ball back in. 
"You say, that's not a good sign," Yankees manager Joe Torre said. 
But one night after failing to take advantage of numerous chances, the New York Yankees rallied past the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 4-1 Thursday as slumping Hideki Matsui hit a tiebreaking, two-run single in a three-run sixth inning.

"I should make that play. I'm a lot better player than that," Branyan said. 
He was making his first start of the year at third because Ty Wigginton shifted to second to replace Jorge Cantu, who went on the disabled list Wednesday with a broken left foot. 
"If I hit him 100 fungos, he'll make that play 99 times," Devil Rays manager Joe Maddon said. 
Gathright put Tampa Bay ahead with an RBI single in the fifth inning following Damon Hollins' double. His first-inning catch was the defensive high­light of the game. 
"Sheff doesn't like me too much right now, I guess," he said. "I've made some diving catches in the gaps, but never anything like that, bringing back a home run. I've been waiting to do something like that." 
Torre said Minnesota's Torii Hunter was the only other play­er capable of making that type of catch because Sheffield had hit the ball so hard on a line. 
"That was a great play _ not the fact that he caught it, the fact that he caught up to it," Torre said. 
Chacon (3-1) allowed four hits in 6 1-3 innings. In his last two starts, he has lowered his ERA from 8.03 to 4.56. 
"Most of it just comes down to being aggressive," he said. 
Mike Myers escaped a two-on jam in the seventh, Kyle Farnsworth got the last two outs of the eighth and Tanyon Sturtze allowed a leadoff single in the ninth. Mariano Rivera, who allowed a pair of lOth­inning runs in a 38-pitch outing Wednesday, got three outs for his third save in four chances. 
"I was ready," Rivera said. "It didn't matter how many pitches I threw yesterday." . 
Hendrickson, making his first start after a stint on the dis­abled list caused by shoulder tightness, gave up just four hits in six innings, and all the runs off him were unearned because of Branyan's error.

Irish -win rescheduled gatne against Valparaiso, 6-2 
By JAY FITZPATRICK 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame rebounded from its 7-4 home loss to Purdue Wednesday with a 6-2 victory against Valparaiso Thursday behind a three-run rally in the third. 
A single by shortstop Sara Schoonaert and a fielder's choice by Linda Kohan set up Notre Dame's first run of the third against the Crusaders (18­2(>, 5-11 Mid-Continent Conference), as Meagan Ruthrauff's single to right tied the game at two. Second base­man Katie Laing followed with a double to right, driving in two more Irish runs for a 4-2 lead. 
Notre Dame had fallen behind early in the game after a two­run Valparaiso second. Irish starting pitcher Heather Booth gave up two runs in the inning -only one of which was earned -on a double and a single, but worked out of the jam by getting Crusaders center fielder Karen Korb to foul out to third base. Booth pitched a four-hit gem other than the sec­ond, striking out three and allowing only four hits in the game. 

"Heather did have one inning when they got some hits off of her, but she go(back in control and buckled down," Irish coach Deanna Gumpf said. 
The third inning was proof of the intensity that the Irish have used all season to win games ­something that Gumpf has told her team is necessary to its suc­cess. 
"The hitters are really confi­dent right now," Gumpf said. "We keep swinging at the good pitches and just do what we need to do to win." 
Notre Dame added a run in each of the next two innings, the highlight of which was in the top of the fourth when left fielder Gessica Hufnagle blasted the first homerun of her career over the left field fence. The Irish capped off their scoring against the Crusaders in the fifth inning. Kohan led off the inning with a hard-hit ground ball up the middle for a single. Ruthrauff followed with a deep double to right field to drive in Kohan from first.

Gumpf said the Irish played well against the Crusaders, especially after the second inning, as Booth allowed only one hit in the last five innings of the game. 
The Irish will resume Big East play this weekend with double­headers against Big East new­comers South Florida and Louisville Saturday and Sunday, respectively. 
The doubleheaders will be two of the toughest tests for Notre Dame this season, as the Bulls and the Cardinals are sec­ond and third. respectively, in the Big East behind the Irish. 
Notre Dame and USF each have only one Big East loss on the season, and the match-up will be crucial in deciding the top seeds in the Big East tour­nament. 
But the Irish aren't worrying about the Big East yet, knowing they still have tough competi­tion ahead of them 
''I'm not looking past Saturday," Gumpf said. "We have to take care of South Florida, and when we do that we have to take care of Louisville. 
"This is going to be a big weekend for us."

You're Invited for 
Stovall 
continued from page 24 

What's morn, Stovall's breakout ynar eamn during a season when questions rnmained about how thn receiver who graced the cover of Sports Illustrated as a frnshman had disappearnd in the midst of c:oaehing changes and Irish mndioerity. 
But thosn close to Stovall (6­foot-5, 222 pounds) knnw his tal­nnt was them all along. It was only a matter of being in the wrong offnnsive system while simultaneously attnmpting to live up to thn expectations hn set fix himsnlf his frnshman year. 
.lust ask his fathnr, Maurice Stovall Sr. 
"Mo is prntty much the most produetivn lreeniverl in his class," Stovall Sr. said in a phone interview with Thn Observer Thursday. "If he had gotten thn ball a little morn learlierl ... hn could havn benn a lot more pro­ductive." 
Part of Uw mason hn didn't get tlw ball morp frequnntly during his sophomorn and junior ynars was bncause forrnnr c:oaeh Tyronn Willingham and curront coach Charlin Wnis had dill'nrnnt idnas about how Stovall should lw used in tlw oll'ense. Stovall Sr. said his son was in a position whnn1 Weis told him to los11 25 pounds before the 2005 s1mson bneausn lw had bPen asked by Willingham to add tlw woight narlinr. 
"Thn main thing, as I sne, who­nvnr gets Maurien is going to get a gnn Unman," Stovall Sr. said. "lin will do everything that you ask him to -and that's the typn of young man hn is." 
And that willingness for the blue-chip prospect from Philadelphia to compromise his individual goals for the team ­while other classmates like Ohio State receiver Santonin llolmes and Florida's Chad Jaekson were piling up numbers -revealed this charaeter. 
But now the issue isn't if Stovall will ever reach his poten­tial and be drafted -it's only a mattnr of when and where. And this reality has beeome a fre­quently asked question leading up to the drart. Many experts have pegged him falling some­where in the second or third round, including NFI.DraftCountdown.com analyst Scott Wright. 
"I think he could go as high as the second round Ito Philadelphia)," Wright said in a phone interview with The Observer Thursday. "lie's really the type of big Ireceiver I they need." 
A return to Philadelphia would be coming full drcle. As a high school prospect from Arehbishop Carroll in Philadelphia, Stovall had his choice of any major col­lege. lie was heavily recruited as an Army All-American and chosn Notrn Dame over Gnorgia Tnch, Michigan, Tennessee and Virginia. 
With all the exdtenwnt n~turn­ing to play in Philadelphia could generate for the area and the Stovall family. Stovall Sr. said the family would bn satisfied no mat­ter wlwre he ends up. 
"That's exciting lor us knowing that's a possibility he'll go t11 Philadelphia with their second pick," Stovall Sr. said. "All you ask for as a young man ... is the opportunity to showcase lyourl skills. 

"If he's there for IPhiladelphial. Fine. If he goes somewhere else [earlier] ... we'll be elated." 
Wright said if Philadelphia does not target Stovall in the middle of the second round, New England, Pittsburgh and Denver might be interested. Wright named New England as the team most likely to pursue a big receiver like Stovall. 
In the last two seasons, New England lost two starting receivers -David Givens (Tennessee) and David Patten (Washington) -to free agency. With third receiver Troy Brown quickly aging (he will be 35 in July), Weis' old friend Bill Belichik might be interested in Stovall's services, Wright said. 
"You look at the build," Wright said. "The one thing teams are gonna take away from Stovall is the !jump ball ability!." 
That same jump ball athleti­eism is attractive to Pittsburgh as well. Wright said the Steelers could target Stovall as a replace­ment for Plaxico Burress, the 6­foot-6 receiver who signed with the Giants after the 2004 season. 
But regardless of where Stovall lands, h11 will be fulfilling a life­long dwam for both he and his family. And Stovall Sr. said the most important thing is that he was able to reach this point after a college earner that wasn't always on the up -well, until lately, that is. 
"lie's in the position that we had anticipated he'd be in," Stovall Sr. said. "Last year [the draft experts! were saying he'd possibly go in the sixth or sev­enth round. We're just excited about ... where he is right now."

Big East title in sight for No. 12 Irish crew 
By TIM KAISER Sports Writer 

No. 12 Notre Dame enters Sunday's Big East Championship at Lake Quinsigamond in Worcester, Mass. as the favorite to win the varsity eight. 
The Irish will compete against Cincinnati, Connecticut, Georgetown, Louisville, Hutgers, Syracuse and West Virginia in the event. It will be the first competition in three weeks for Notrn Dame -which last rownd at the Indiana Classic on April 8 and 9 -in which the Irish defeated thnn-No. 15 Wisconsin in the varsity eight, finishing with a time or 6:55.80. 
Notre Dame's varsity eight team, consisting of junior coxswain Maria Bomano, sophomores Julie Sobolewski, Amanda Polk, Mary Quinn, Laura Pearson and Allison Marsh, and seniors Melissa Fnlker, Mnghan Boyle and Sarah Palandech, also finished second to reining national champs California in their see­ond race at the Classic. 
Despite the team's suecHss, Notre Dame has continued to work just as hard in praetien to prepare for the Championship, Palandeeh 
said. 
"We've been doing a lot of hard work. and we've been tired, but we've just been pushing on, getting stronger eaeh day," she said. "We want to row really well, go really fast and win as many events as we possibly can. Wn want to control whatever we ean control." 
The Irish are making sure the high expnctations and past results don't affect their preparation or their perform­ance. 
"IThe aeeolados ami flatter­ing," Palandeeh said. "But it's not something that wn can pnrform with. You still have to go out thern, and the compnti­tion is going to bn tough, and a labnl is not going to get thn job donn." 
Asidn from not overestimat­ing themselves, thn Irish are making sure not to undnrnsti­matn thn eompntition. 
"Tiwy'ro really gnmt tnams, and they'rn not sornnthing to mess around with," Palandeeh said of the Big East eompeti­tion. "Louisvillo looks likn it's a very talnntnd tnam and Syracuse will also bo a chal­lenge, but it really depends, because there are so many difTerent schools and events."

NFL DRAFT 
Le Voir and Stevenson work out for pro teams 
By KATE GALES Associate Sports Editor 
This weekend's NFL Draft will shape the next few years in the lives of Notre Dame offensive linemen Mark LeVoir and Dan Stevenson. 
LeVoir, a native of Eden Prairie, Minn., and Stevenson, from Barrington, Ill., have inter­viewed with almost all 32 NFL teams in anticipation for the draft. 
"The most difficult thing is just the unknowing," LeVoir said. "You have no clue where you're going to go, what's going to hap­pen.... You're going to be in one of the 32 NFL cities, but you can't plan or do anything until you know [which one]." 
LeVoir started 36 straight games at right tackle with the Irish. He has traveled to Cincinnati and Chicago, and talked to most -if not all -of the NFL teams. He began prepa­rations for the draft immediately after Notre Dame's 34-20 loss in the Fiesta Bowl Jan. 2. 
"All I did to prepare was pre­pare for pro day and personal workouts," he said. "Some guys chose to stay here -I chose to go down to Arizona for a change of scene." 
Stevenson, a right guard, spent time in Houston preparing for various pre-draft events. 
"I trained there for five weeks before the combine, went to the combine, came back to school and I just worked out here with our strength coach here," he said. "We had a pro day [on campus], and a couple individ­ual workouts with teams that I did." 

Stevenson has also talked to all of the NFL teams. 
"It's no telling where you're going to go in the draft, where you're going to go and the kind of pressure is definitely some­thing.... You can't understand until you're there," Stevenson said. 
Both linemen said it's hard to believe that Draft day is fmally here. 
"I still don't think it's really hit me all that much," Stevenson said. "Even at the Blue-Gold game last weekend, even that,

it's hard to feel that your time here at Notre Dame is over and you're moving onto something you've obviously always dreamed of." 
LeVoir, who is still living in South Bend, has experienced the same sense of a turning point. 
''I'm just trying to soak it all in and enjoy my last few days here at Notre Dame," LeVoir said. 
An important part of their Notre Dame experience, Stevenson said, was Irish coach Charlie Weis, who proved a valuable resource as the two prepared to make the jump to the NFL. 
"I've had a huge support staff," Stevenson said. "I don't think this process would have been as easy without them ­Coach Weis, [Notre Dame offen­sive line] Coach Latina, obvious­ly my family -just talking to them, they obviously keep my spirits high." 

LeVoir mentioned Weis specifi­cally as a significant mentor. 
"[He's] the best resource a col­lege player could ever want," he said. "With his experience in the NFL, it speaks for itself." 
As for draft day, LeVoir will be playing golf or doing something else to relax, and Stevenson will wait to hear about his friends while focusing on other things. 
"What's going to happen is what's going to happen," LeVoir said.

"They're great guys, and that's one of the best decisions I've made so far," he said of his agents. "You never get lost in the mix. [It's] really a family style type of place." 
Fasano said teams have asked him everything from what CD he has in his Walkman to the last book he read and the last nice thing he has done for somebody else. 
Brian Murphy of Athletes First said he told Fasano to be himself when fielding questions in inter­views because he believes teams will value the type of person Fasano is. 
"Teams want players who are going to make an impact off the field," Murphy said. 
Murphy's firm also represents Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer and New York Giants receiver Amani Toomer, both of whom have earned praise for their involvement in the commu­nity. Palmer signed one of the NFL's largest contract extensions this off-season that will keep him in Cincinnati through 2014. Murphy said one of Bengals owner Mike Brown's reasons for giving Palmer the contract ­reportedly valued at $49 million -was Palmer's extensive com­munity service and reputation as an upstanding citizen. 
Murphy said to attract that type of person is a goal of the firm -and why Fasano fits in as a client. 
But Murphy said he also knows Fasano has the skills to make an impact on the field. As a 1992 graduate from Notre Dame, Murphy said he watched Fasano develop as a receiver and blocker since the New Jersey native started three games in 2004 under Tyrone Willingham. 

"What he has done this year under [Irish] coach [Charlie] Weis speaks for itself," Murphy said. 
Fasano gives Weis credit for teaching him how to study film better and how to be a profes­sional. 
"Coach Weis has done a lot for me not only in the way to pre­pare but a lot off the field," Fasano said. 
But even Fasano's advantages don't make him a sure-fire, early round pick. Murphy said the 2006 draft has as many quality tight ends of any draft he has seen. 
Maryland's Vernon Davis is 
expected to be a top-15 pick and the first tight end taken in the Draft. Davis is joined by Marcedes Lewis of UCLA, Leonard Pope of Georgia and Fasano as top-line prospects leaving college this year. 
"Every team needs an all­around good tight end that's willing to do blocking and pass catching the same," Fasano said. "I think I do have the potential to be an impact play­er." 
Expected to be a middle-round pick in the NFL Draft, Fasano said he is excited to make the jump to the pros. 
"Everything's been going real well," he said. "It's been a great whole process for me." 
Fasano fmished his career sec­ond among tight ends in Notre Dame history with 92 recep­tions. He averaged 12.2 yards a catch for 1,112 yards and eight touchdowns in three years. 

He had two touchdowns and 47 receptions in 2005 and was a finalist for the John Mackey Award, given annually to the best tight end in the country. 
"I just want to get drafted as high as possible, and I hope someone drafts me on the first day," Fasano said. "But you never know." 
Murphy said he advises all his clients who won't be drafted early in the first round to stay active in the morning and then spend time with their families in the afternoon. 
Fasano said he would take that advice. 
"I probably will go play golf in the morning to stay away from the TV," he said. "It's just a long day."

Belles battle for berth in the second season 
By DEIRDRE KRASULA 
Spores Writer 

Saint Mary's heads on the road Saturday to take on Kalamazoo at 1 p.m. in its last regular season game, hoping to secure a berth in the MIAA tournament. 
The Belles are currently No. 3 in the league, leading Albion and Olivet by one game. The top four teams in the conference earn bids to the tournament. 
Saint Mary's last squared off with Kalamazoo last sea­son when the Belles swept the Hornets 4-3 and 10-4. 
The two wins over 
Kalamazoo were the only two conference wins the Belles collected in the 2005 season. But Saint Mary's enters the weekend with a 25-11 record, including a 9-5 mark in league play. 
Kalamazoo is 1-13 in MIAA action heading into its final game. The Hornets last played Tuesday against Olivet and fell 11-0 and 12-0. 
Kalamazoo pitcher Michelle Brittain and first baseman Emily Schoolmaster each posted a hit in the game. 
Before the losses to Olivet, the Hornets swept Goshen 6-5 and 2-1 on April 22. Brittain
