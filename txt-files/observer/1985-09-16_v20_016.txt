Post created to assist handicapped students 
By ROBERT RAPHAEL 
NeuiSStaff 
As a result of the increased enroll­ment of disabled students, Assistant Provost Sister John Miriam Jones was appointed last July as coor­dinator of disabled students by Provost Timothy O'Meara. 
"It wa..~ time to do something dif· ferent," Jones explained, "We realized we needed one person to oversee efforts to serve disabled stu· 
dent.~." 
Previously, the University Com· mittee for the Physically Handicapped and the Office of Stu· dent Affairs provided services to disabled students. 
Jones' responsibilities include ac­cessibility to buildings and clas· srooms, communication with faculty and administrators regarding special academic needs, referring disabled students and evaluating long term needs. 
"All ofa sudden we have more stu· dents who we have to be concerned about," Jones said. This year's fresh· man class, as last year's, has regis­tered 2S disabled students. Previously. there were less than 10 disabled students in each class, es· timated Jones. 
This increase can be traced to the 1974 Equal Educational Oppur­tunlty Act, which stated that educa· tiona! institutions could not discriminate against disabled stu· dents, according to Jones. In addi· tion, she said, educational institutions that accepted federal funding could not deny services to disabled students. Disabled students who started their primary education in 1974 in an ordinary environment are now ofcollege age. 
In 1974 Notre Dame formed the committee to work towards the ac­cessibility of buildings and to insure that services were not denied to stu· dents. 
Currently, Notre Dame meets its legal obligations. 
"But that's not the only thing we're interested in. We want to make the experience of a disabled student a..~ good as it possibly can be,"Jones said. 
Jones attributed the impetus of concern for the disabled to Stephen Rogers, who chaired the committee since 1980. Rogers, a blind profes­sor, dedicated his time to working with the disabled. "Stephen was our inspiration," Jones said. 
Last year, Notre Dame spent S20,000 restoring St. Edward's Hall to make it accessible to handicapped students. Father Pedi, rector, states the money was used to install two remote control doors, building spe·

Thatcher plans reply to Soviet expulsions 
Associated Press 
LONDON · Prime Minister Mar­garet Thatcher summoned two of her senior Cabinet officials for ur­gent talks yesterday on whether to order out more Soviets in response to the Soviet Union's expulsion of 2S Britons. 
Press Association, the British domestic news agency, said Mrs. Thatcher, Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe and Home Secretary Douglas Hurd reached a decision, but were keeping it secret to avoid giving the Soviets advance notice. 
The agency's unattributed report said the decision would be an· nounced before Mrs. Thatcher leaves this afternoon for a four-day visit to Egypt andJordan. 
Aspokeswoman for Mrs. '11latcher confirmed that the meeting took place, but refused to give details. 
Howe had cut short a weekend break to begin what he said were "urgent and careful" talks with aides on how to respond to the Kremlin's move, announced Saturday. Mrs. Thatcher returned to London from her country retreat, Chequers, for the late-night session with Howe and Hurd.

Enough football fun found without road trip to Ann Arbor 
O.K., so I'm a loser. 
While everybody else on campus made the trip to Ann Arbor to see the Wolverines knock off the Irish, I stayed at Notre Dame. The token junior Arts and Letters student among hundreds of car-less freshmen and throaty engineers. 
Now I'm paying the price. 
I've heard incessantly for two days that Notre Dame is not a real campus. At Michigan, people saunter up to a keg instead of mowing down everything in sight to get to one, and, "there were 60 girls to your left, 60 girls to your right, and they were all fantastic!!!" 
This last comment came from a just-returned and still-euphoric Domer (whom I saw at a misery party Saturday night -black armbands required) who kept repeating it to me and adding mournfully, "You'll never see anything like that at Notre Dame, Mary." 
Well, I'll reserve comment on that statement, but one thing I'm sure he missed out on was the experience of watching the game on TV. 
Now don't mistake me, I've seen my share of televised football games, and I've even seen my team lose on occasion. So this game should have been like many others. Why was it so different? 
I should have been clued­in even before kickoff that I was in for a strange after­noon. From the moment a particularly clueless girl in a crowded Keenan room heard the name Ara Parseg­hian and inquired in­nocently who "Eric" was, and ifhe had anything to do with Notre Dame football, I probably should have left in search of another TV. But even that wouldn't have helped. 
True, I would not have had to hold my temper and 
stifle impatient outbursts when she asked things like, 
"Was that bad for Notre Dame?'' as the Irish fumbled a 
kickoff inside the 20-yard line. 
But nothing short of turning down the sound could 
help me escape the inane and rambling commentary of 
CBS Sports. 
For example, what exactly did Bo Schembechler 
mean when he said that he'd like to maintain a 
"semblance of possession?" You either have the ball or 
you don't. There's no in between. As the afternoon 
wore on, however, I began to realize that whatever Bo's 
"semblance of possession" meant, the result was going 
to be disastrous for Notre Dame. 
Or what about Brent Musburger's enlightening com­
ment, "What has hurt Notre Dame has been Michigan's 
drives."? Either Mr. Musburger assumed his entire

audience was composed of "Who's Eric?" types, or he merely felt an enormous compulsion to demonstrate his incredible grasp ofthe obvious. 
The guys watching the game with me were almost as good as the commentators at underestimating the intel­ligence of the room's female contingent. Granted, the clueless girl in the corner did her best to enhance our reputation. But in general, the idea that one is a football incompetent simply because one is a girl, is a myth that needs to be dispelled. Therefore, the statement that 
"Michigan only needs a touchdown and conversion to go ahead" when the score was ND 6, Michigan 0, was rather unnecessary. 
By game's end, however, even these irritations were forgotten in the apathetic gloom that hung over the survivors of the first contest in the 1985-86 season. 
We all trudged back to our respective dorms to sit quietly in darkened rooms and search our pasts to dis­cover what we had done horrible enough to bring such a fate upon us. But all 
q.f6 was not lost. Good old Bill Hickey and 
the University Food Services, perhaps sensing such an outcome, had the foresight to prepare pizza, chicken patties and choc­olate chip cookie bars to assuage our misery. 
So, all of you who were stupid enough to make the long trip to Ann Arbor and have to put up with endless kegs, rows of60 fantastic girls, and frat parties-don't try to tell me that I should have road-tripped to Michigan for entertainment. I had all I could stand. 
All the effort it took, was assembling a clueless girl, Brent Musburger, and the Fighting Irish.

Colleges react to student protests; sell off interests in South Africa 
Associated Press 
Aspring of campus protests and a summer of South African violence have swelled the ranks of colleges that are selling all or part of their in­vestments in companies with dealings in South Africa. 
Since April, when scores of U.S. campuses erupted in anti-apanheid protests, about 20 colleges and uni­versities from Maine to Arizona have adopted policies of total or partial divestiture of South Africa-related holdings. 
Sixty-one schools have sold nearly S300 million in such portfolio hol­dings since tiny Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., became the na­tion's first college in 1977 to adopt a South Africa-free investment policy, according to the American Commit­tee on Africa, a New York-based anti­apartheid lobbying group. 
A spot check by The Associated Press found many other colleges actively considering tougher policies as well. 
In recent weeks: 
Columbia University, the scene last spring ofsome ofthe most bitter student demonstrations, announced it is likely to agree next month to divest itself of its S39 million in stocks of companies with South African operations. The plan has the suppon of Columbia President Mic­hael Sovern. 
Columbia, in New York, would be the first Ivy League college to adopt a policy of total divestiture of South African investments. 
Rutgers University in New Jer­sey, another hotbed of student protest last spring, was considered all but certain to accept an Invest­ment committee recommendation made on Aug. 30 to sell its remaining 
17.5 million in South African hol­dings. 
The 
University of Iowa divested Itself of more than 90 percent, or about S2.3 million worth, of its South African-related holdings. Some students were angered be­cause the school insisted It acted for economic, not moral, reasons. 

By contrast, a committee set up to study divestiture at Iowa State Uni­versity is expected to recommend shortly that the school sell its 1550,000 in such holdings, for moral reasons. 

The 
Arizona Board of Regents voted Sept. 6 to order the University of Arizona in Tucson and Arizona 


State University In Tempe to divest themselves of their 13.3 million in South Africa-related holdings as soon as possible. 
Bitterly 
divided trustees of the University of Vermont opted last week for limited divestment of the school's 17.3 million in South Africa­related investments. Vermont Gov. Madeleine Kunin argued in vain for full divestiture at the emotion­char~ed hearing. 

As 
a result of tightened Invest­ment policies adopted this summer, Oberlin College announced this past week it had sold U.S. Steel stock valued at 1620,000 and IMS interna­tional shares worth 1142,000 be­cause neither company had signed the "Sullivan Principles," a voluntary code of conduct In which firms agree to work against apartheid. 


Among the schools that say they are reviewing their South African In­vestment policies are Harvard, Yale, Massachusetts Institute of Technol­ogy, University of Southern Califor­nia, University of Notre Dame, Indiana University, Northwestern University, Johns Hopkins Univer­sity, Brown University, the Univer­sity of Rhode Island, and Wesleyan University.

Superior Court Judge Corinne Grande ordered the weekend mediation Friday, hours after 2,000 of the district's 8,200 students were turned away from school because only 12 teachers obeyed her order to return to the classroom. She said she would consider citing the teac­hers for contempt ifthe talks fal.l.

Jones is now concerned with problems such as narrow classroom doorways and heavy doors that make passage difficult for hand­Icapped students. 
"People who have obstacles to overcome are special people,"Jones a1ffirmed. Currently, there are over 75 disabled students at Notre Dame. Their disabilities include: paralysis, anhritls, leg amputation, cerebral palsy, heart condition, blindness, hearing impairment, nerve damage, readb.\g disabilities and quad­raplegics.

The bigger things in life are not always the better 
Has any news caught your attention lately? Seen any headlines? Remember the air dis­aster in Japan that cost 520 lives? Or how about the space shuttle, logging more miles every single day. And gee, we certainly cannot forget Pete Rose breaking Ty Cobb's record Wednesday night. 
Tom Considine 
the answer 
For better or for worse, characteristics of our media and press mirror similar charac­teristics ofour society at large. Case in point, our obsession with size and quantity, oursolid belief that numbers do not lie and that bigger numbers tell better stories. C'mon, who has the biggest and loudest stereo on your floor, I am sure you know. Who has the most cars in your neighborhood, again, I'm sure that you know. 
Question: What do many people desperately want? Answer: The biggest bank account. 
People are interested in size and quantity; it is seen in their priorities and their actions. Similarly, our society is obsessed with size, and this obsession is reflected In the news media of our day. Perhaps that is why such items as airline disasters make such extensive headlines; people are fascinated that so many passengers could die. Perhaps that Is why the space shuttle receives so much attention; people are amazed by the fact that a funny shaped metallic crate can do so much and go so far. And perhaps that's why Pete Rose's quest Is so newsworthy; people are enthralled by so many hits. 
This fascination with size reminds me of a trip that I made two years ago. I went to a state park to see an awesome 800 foot gorge. Believe me, this was quite a sight: deep drops offlat stone, dangerous slopes, even a railroad tressle that spanned this natural wonder. You should have seen the people; they were doing everything in their power to get the best view. One guy was climbing a gnarled tree; another was leaning dangerously over a fence, a third held his two year old kid over the edge. 
It seemed that everyone in that park was staring down that gorge. Everyone was trying to get that perfect view, myself included. 
Then, for some unexplained reason, I turned my head from that fascinating sight and looked behind me at a patch ofgrass about 20 feet away. There sat a four year old boy, away from everyone else; there he sat -just staring at one little, insignificant object. But I could tell that he was as enthralled by that dandelion as all the adults were by the gorge. 
It was right then and there I learned the im­portance oflittle things. 
An Englishman once remarked to me that "Everything in America is big." Well, what I think he meant was our country has a special place in its heart for the big things, for those deep gorges and big news events. And suppose a love for the big is fine in Itself. But just do not forget those dandelions and those little things. Perhaps someday you will realize that bigger is not better -only bigger.

We should put our wealth into another perspective 

Just when you think you have got everyth­ing in perspective, along comes a child who innocently knocks you back into reality and forces you to rethink your ideals. Willis, an eleven year old from South Bend, had this ef­fect on me. A friend of mine, Joe, is his "Big Brother."

ice of unfamiliarity. Joe thought he had hit upon the perfect topic, sports. In the midst of this conversation, a prominent Notre Dame basketball player happened to walk by. Willis got soexcited thatJoe walked over to him and asked if he'd mind saying hello to Willis. The athlete walked over to Willis and introduced himself. Willis put his tiny hands in the large hands of the basketball player and looked up in childish awe. 
"I hope you're going to root for me this year.l'm counting on you." 
"I will." 
"Watch all the games, OK?" 
"I'll try." 
Not too impressive a conversation, but one which made Willis' · day. Afterwards, Joe teased Willis about his amazement with the athlete, and asked if he had watched any bas­ketball games last year. Willis said he had not. 
"Why not?" 
"I don't have a television." 
Surprised at his answer, it suddenly became apparent why Willis had thoughtJoe was rich. I had been looking at wealth from my perspective, while Willis, who did not own

half of the items in the room, judged wealth based on the things he could call his own. Compared to tliat, JOC! certainly seemed wealthy. Willis had not seemed envious; he was just making a statement which appeared factual to him. 
After getting over my initial surprise that anyone should think something a luxury when most people consider it a commodity, I thought about how lucky we are. Sure, we all vary in degrees of good fortune and we all wish we had more, but when we put our lives in focus we should realize how lucky we are. We can all watch television, wear cool clothes, buy food when the dining hall is at its worst and catch the football and basketball games when we feel like it. When we graduate we will all be in a position to make decent money and live the kind of lives we are ac­customed to. Not too much will be beyond our reach, and we probably will never lack for the necessities. We should consider these things the next time we feel a little sorry for ourselves.

based solely on ourselves. Instead the fact that some people want more because they do not have the necessities should be the perspective by which we judge thinwo. 
Feeling sorry for people less fortunate than we are is not enough. One twist offate and we could have been "those people." Giving some­thing to one less fortunate than yourself is a gift that will not soon be forgotten. This need not mean monetary giving; sometimes giving ofyourselfis the best gift ofall. 
The day with Willis ended with a thank you and still we had not given anything that could be considered tangible. All we'd given him was some time and attention. Saying goodbye, Joe gave Willis his phone number and told the boy to call the next time he wanted to come over. 
"I can't," Willis said. "Why not?" "I don't have a phone." Joe gave him a quarter.

Chauvinism rampant in writer's column 
near Editor: 
Although I am not a Saint Mary's student, I wa.-; appalled at the faulty reasoning and ram­pant chauvinism expressed in Erin O'Brien's Viewpoint editorial,"Dedsion to go coed at Saint Mary's is weighed." 
First, a matter ofterminology: as long as any coUegt·-aged woman continues to call herself and her peers "girls," she is inviting all those around her to treat her as such. Women are far more likely than girls to earn the respect of their peers and their superiors. 
In addition, the term "guys" is similarly degrading to men. "Guys" can be a friendly and neuter phra.-;e referring to any group of peers, male or female. The stereotyping of "guys". as "sweaty, competitive, dominant and egotistical" dating machines is offensive to both men and women alike. 
Second, O'Brien seems to confuse the pos­sibility of the college going coed with the ac­tuality of coed dorms and the subsequent abolition of parietals. A quick walk through the Notre Dame campus would reveal that C<K'ducation is not the same a.-; cohabitation. 
Third, O'Brien's hypothesis that the mere presence of "guys" on campus would make the academic integrity of the College legitimate denies the proven excellence of a Saint Mary's education. In addition, her very next paragraph on the alleged "final advantage" of having "guys everywhere" is not only insulting to both men and women, but also destroys the claim to greater academic integrity she wa.<; trying to establish. 
Perhaps if O'Brien could see beyond the chauvinist stereotypes she herself promotes in her article, she might come to understand that the real "woman's world" does not dt·pend on the mere presence or absence of men, but on the ability to perceive the in­
herent  worth, dignity,  and  equality of all  
human beings.

Stereotype of feminism harmful to everyone 
J)ear Editor: 
I wholeheartedly agreed with Maura Man­dyck's attack on the "shameless stereotyping" in television cartoons. She is right to worry about the effects on impressionable children, "being subliminally convinced that half the population is worthless." 
But it's not necessary to get up early Satur­day morning to experience gender-oriented stereotyping · one need only look to the opening lines of Mandyck's column. Why is it necessary to begin with the disclaimer that she is not a feminist and follow with a trite and ludicrous depiction of feminists? The efforts ofsome to paint a picture offeminists as unat­tractive, humorless women, dressed in drab clothing, working tirelessly for unisex bathrooms, women in combat, the break-up of the nuclear family and the end of the American way oflife have beensadly effective. 
Webster's New World Dictionary defines feminism as "the movement to win political, economic and social equality for women." Yet feminists are often portrayed in blatantly stereotypical ways. "I'm not a feminist, but ..." Surely the goals ofpolitical, economic and so­
cia! equality are nothing to be ashamed oft 
How refreshing it would have been to read 
Mandyck's column in The Observer begin­
ning with the proclamation that she is a 
feminist, followed by the same good, 
pointedly humorous treatment of a serious 
subject. One sure way to eliminate a negative 
image is to replace it with a positive one. Ifthe 
negative stereotype of feminism persists, 
"both men and women will suffer a loss."

Greedy administration makes seniors cynical 
DearEditor: 

When Icame here three years ago as a fresh­man, I was full of optimisim about the bright four years that were opening before me. Op­timisim that Notre Dame would win the Na­tional Championship, optimism that the Administration really cared about students, optimism that this was going to be the best four years of my life... 
Three long years later I look back at those freshman days and think of the senior's at­titudes towards ND, about their pessimism and criticism, and I thought with a freshman's optimism: They're all just too critical. Now I seefour years later that they weren't sofar off. 
Why has ND become such a depressing place to be? Because the Administration has become a purely capitalistic organization in the best tradition of Marxist doctrine. They are out to survive and prosper at any expense, especially that of the student. How can I say this, you ask? Look around you at the actions of the University and see how two faced it really is. First off, let's look at the teaching here. Many of the professors are so involved with research that they cannot properly prepare for class. This is evident especially in the engineering and science departments-­while I am not about to specifically name professors, you upperclassmen affected should know what Iam talking about. The Uni­versity is dedicated to research and the prestige and money it brings the University, NOT how it effects the poor teaching that results from not enough time to prepare for class. I'm not against progress, but when someone is paying for a class, they deserve better treatment than this. 
In addition, another instance of the Univer­sity's greediness is evident by the recent en­dowments reported received earlier in the beginning of the semester in the Observer. 'Ibis was called one of the ."largest recorded" endowments to be received by the Ad­ministration, yet the price of room and board has increased approximately 7 percent --more than the National Inflation rate--while the stu­dents and parents paying for ND can see no relief in sight. 
Consistent with the Administration's self dedication to financial security and prestige is the continued building of structures that do not better the life of the average student. Granted the LaFortune renovation is under­way in addition to the Law school addition, but look at how long it has taken tht: Ad­ministration to get around to it. And during this time what about the real needs--more living and social space. Oh--sure, new dorms are planned for sometime in the future, but they will probably take as long to get started on as has LaFortune and the Law school addi­tion. Some people will bring up the swimming pool. That will probably function like the weight room in the ACC: restricted to varsity use during the few hours students could pos­
sibly use it. And to quickly name another few sore spots, how about: the new loft policy to abolish lofts in the next four years, the health hazard of no air conditioning in the Pasquerilla's and the rector policy as ex­emplified by the 'firing' ofFather Steve at Car­roll Hall to name a few. 
Then we come to the Fountain. Why? I can think ofabsolutely no reason why it should be built. Ifthe Administration wanted to dedicate something to ND students who died in the wars, they should dedicate something that will be appreciated and used, like the LaFortune renovation, or a new dorm, not a $500,000 Stonehenge. The fountain's location doesn't even make sense. The fieldhouse mall was one of the few. crossing places on North Quad where students ran into each other and could just sit on the grass and talk, read, listen to bands, or play firsbee--but since we all know it's illegal to play on the grass the criticism is invalid anvway. 
Many ofyou out there are going to ask if you hate this place so much, why don't you leave. Simply, I cannot. Financial and other commit­ments prevent it, and if I could, I would, ex­cept that I would miss the people who make this place worthwhile. I have been told that I should accept ND as it is since many places are worse off, or no better. Ifthis is so, then we are really doomed because no body of students should have to be ruled in such an autocratic manner, and if this truly is "as good as It gets," tllen there is something very wrong with the scholastick system and the society that created it. 
My advice to you new freshmen is this: If you l:an find a better place, transfer. Ifyou are committed to four years here just as I am, then I charge you not to sit back and endure the Administration's tyranny. Revolt. Build your box fountains, hang your bedsheet protests, write your letters, and continue to protest to make the Administration feel the pressure. Only as a result of constant pressure can the University be forced to change.

Saint Mary's is great even without the boys 
DearEditor: 

I feel much pride attending and being part of a small, private, Catholic, all women's col­lege -Saint Mary's. And since I read freshman Erin O'Brien's Viewpoint article about a coed Saint Mary's, I have been trying to calm down enough to put my thoughts on paper. 
I'm not sure who "they" are that have been considering the idea ofSaint Mary's admitting "boys." I know 10 years ago it was under con­sideration to combine Notre Dame and Saint Mary's, but was decided against for various reasons. As for a coed campus, I know my friends and I have joked about it, but never with any sincerity. 
A coed college is not what I have been waiting for, nor do I get too excited at the thought of it. First, let's not assume a coed campus means a free-for-all and the · im­mediate removal of parietals. In fact it would more likely increase strict enforcement of them. Although we feel the "curse" of parie­tals, I must admit I am thankful for them many times. I feel much safer knowing I am protected from just anyone offthe street wan­dering through our halls, and it's saved me at least twice this year from kicking out my 

roommate and her boyfriend when I want to 
go to sleep. 
I think the Saint Mary's reputation of "girls here for their MRS degree" is one that follows women all over the country, both at public and private schools. I know the high place­ment and valued reputation of a Saint Mary's degree, however, far outshines the former. 
Let's look beyond the fact that there are no men enrolled in this school. That does not mean we no longer care how we look or dress. There is so much pride here -yes, in the way we dress and smell, but also In our classwork and relationships with faculty, administration, and classmates. I love sitting in a small class of about 1 5 and really getting involved in a good discussion, even when one ofthose students is a Notre Dame boy! 
I guess the presence of boys was not a priority as I was choosing a college -educa­tion was. I have found the freedom to par­ticipate in clubs, organizations and student government, and believe it or not, there is plenty of competition! And along with the 
I 
close friendships I have with girls on this 
~ 
campus, I also have them with both girls and , 
guys at Notre Dame. Admittedly it took some 
time, but I've found them worth waiting for. , 
I believe Saint Mary's College offers a very 
1 special atmosphere and excellent education, and I'm so glad I'm here! Relax, freshmen, and give it some time. Soon you will realize parie­tals are not such a big deal when weighed against the advantages ofthis community, and you can still put on a skirt. I hope I'm long gone by the time Saint Mary's goes coed. I'm a SMC chick and proud ofIt!

Rape is a subject that cannot be taken lightly 
DearEditor: 
This Jetter is in response to some comments made by Kevin Flynn on an article by Andy Barlow discussing the supposed lack of campus security. I agree with Flynn that Notre Dame need not be a "Fort Knox" in terms of security. It's also unrealistic, as he points out, to compare the number ofcrimes committed on this campus to the crimes of a metropolis such as Chicago. 
But in his eagerness to defend the efforts of Notre Dame security forces, he does someth­ing that saddens me, for it is becoming com­mon: he de-humanizes the act of rape, an act which is a tragedy for society as a whole, and very traumatic to the individual. 
I call to mind the statement,"Notre Dame has had only one rape in seven years." "Only one" rape (and I don't want to ignore other crimes such as murder, theft, etc.), Is im­mediately too many times. The occurrence of rape is something that should not be used as supporting evidence to the defense of any security force, just because it's "below average" in national standard'i. 
Kevin Flynn, I want to thank you for helping to protect the well-being of all people who walk on this campus. But plea.o;e allow me to remind you that the only time rape can be a good statistic is when it does not exist at all. I'd hate to be there when that rape victim of last semester picks up the paper to read that she has been the "only" rape victim In seven years.

Having a good time is exactly what Lagorio intends to do. "I plan to do some things never done before -let's just say funny things .. . I just hope I don't kill myself," he says. 
In such a coveted position, others tend to question Lagorio's inten· tions.

Dolphins, 49ers recover to gain wins 
Aslloclated PrcM 
Dan Marino won over the fans while winning the game that kept alive Coach Don Simla's home opener streak as Miami defeated the Indianapolis Colts 30-13 yesterday. 
Marino, ignoring his first Orange Bowl boos, passed for 329 yards and two touchdowns, hitting on 29 of 48 passess. 
"I was not worried about the crowd reaction," said the third-year quarterback, who turned 24 yester­day. "I just go out and try to do my job the best I can." Marino missed five weeks of the preseason because ofa contract dispute. 
Marino, who led Miami to the Super Bowl last season, was booed when he first trotted onto the field, and again when his first pass was be­hind Mark Duper and fell incom­plete. But he connected on the next two attempts and the ';3,693 fans were back on his side. 
San Francisco, the defending Super Bowl champion, .also turned boos into cheers, as Roger Craig's 62-yard touchdown run highlighted a 3'i-point, second-half which carried the 49ers over the Atlanta by a score of 3'i-16.

cepted by Doug Mallory to end Notre Dame's chances. 
The lack of offensive production by the Irish had many people, in­cluding Wolverine coach Bo Schem­
. bechler, questioning Notre Dame's play selection, especially early in the game. On the nine plays of their first three possessions inside the Mic­higan 20-yard line, the Irish did not pass once. All three of those series resulted in field goals. "I was surprised that they ran so much," noted Schembechler. "People think they can run the ball on us, but I don't know why." That was a question that Beuer­lein also had difficulty answering. "It was frustrating, and a lot of guys didn't understand it," said the Irish quarterback of the abundance of run calls.

One phone call helped me begin to change all that.

Saint Mary's volleyball team takes part in nine-team Illinois tourney 
ByJILL SARBENOFF 
Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's varsity volleyball team opened its season Friday, par­ticipating in a tournament in Elmhurst, Ill. The highlight of the weekend came when the Belles defeated the number-one seed, Elmhurst College, in two games in the opening match. 
After the exciting first match, the team moved on in pool play to take on Augustana College. Nine teams were in the tournament and they were divided into various pools. 
Saint Mary's lost to Augustana, however, in the second match of round one. 
In round two, the Belles defeated Aurora College but lost to Illinois Benedictine. This put Saint Mary's in the consolation bracket with the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth seeds. 
On Saturday morning, the team lost to Augustana again in rmee games and also lost to Carroll Col­lege in three games. With these two losses, the Belles finished the tour­ney in ninth place. 
Throughout the tournament, however, there were some good ef-

The Notre Dame field hockey team opened up its 1985 season this weekend by splitting Its first two games against Ball State and Mic­higan. 
The Irish opened at home Friday with a crushing 6-1 defeat at the handsofa powerful and efficient Ball State team. Ball State, ranked 20 in the preseason poll and probably the toughest opponent the Irish will face this season, proved itself equal to the· advance billing by virtually dominating play throughout the entire game. 
"You can't take a thing away from them,"said Head Coach Jill Linden­feld after the defeat. "Ball State is an outstanding team. They scored all nice goals, used the right side of the field well, and their teamwork was good." 
The game began with the ap­pearance ofbeing a dose match, but eventually Ball State kept the ball in the Irish end long enough to score 11 minutes into the first half on a goal byJune Lenbar. Lenbar went on to score two goals in the first half, and along with an effort from Kelly 
Dawson,  Ball  State  took  a  3-0  
halftime lead.  
The  Irish,  however,  came  uut  

early in the second half playing in­spired hockey. After a particularly fine save by Irish goaltender Patti Gallagher, forward Molly McCabe scored on a spectacular breakaway, and the Irish cut Ball State's lead to 
3-1. 
Hope for a comeback proved to be short-lived for the Irish as Ball State struck again, scoring three times in a 15-minute span. Ball State midfielder Dawson turned in an im­pressive performance, ending the af­ternoon with a hat trick. 
After the game, Irish players had nothing but praise for the Ball State squad. 
"They had excellent stickwork, and they were just better skilled," remarked co-capiain Mary -Kose Rodgers. "But considering the amount oftime we've been out here (practicing), we held up pretty well.' 
"Defensively, their players were not marked tight enough, especially in the circle," said Undenfeld. "We didn't use enough small passes, and tried to do too much with the long ones." 
Goaltender Patti Gallagher, who finished the game with 25 saves, echoed Undenfeld's sentiments on the defense, and added that the ab­sence of co-captain Christine Wein­mann from the game had a lot to do with the lopsided score.
