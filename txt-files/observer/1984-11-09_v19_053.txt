In Brief 
Austrian Foreign Minister Leopold Gratz said 
yesterday that Czechoslovak border guards shot a man in Austrian territory and he summoned Prague's ambassador to protest "the most serious border incident in years" between the two countries. A 33-year old Czechoslovak was found dead Monday on the Austrian side of the border, about 55 miles northeast ofPrague. He had been shot in the back and beside the body police found spent shells they said likely came from a Czechoslovak submachine gun. Czechos­lovak members ofa joint border commission maintain that the man crossed into Austria after he had been shot. -AP

Trivial lawsuit 


like most good games, Trivial Pursuit has simple rules. Roll the die, answer a question, roll the die. 
The one-page instructions end with this admonition: "Because a correct answer always means another roll of the die, a player may meet the game-winning require­ments on the first turn. Ifthis happens, any player who has not yet had a turn is permitted a chance to duplicate the feat." 
No doubt about it, these boys were thinking ofevery­thing. 
Well, everything except the questions. 
That's the complaint of Fred Worth, a 41-year-old trivia expert who is suing the makers of Trivial Pursuit for copyright infringements on his two trivia en­cyclopedias. Worth's $300 million suit claims that the game's Canadian inventors copied questions and answers from Worth's books, including 32 percent of the questions in the "Genus" edition of Trivial Pursuit. Worth further states that 1 0 percent of the questions and answers in the "Baby 
C'mon budd'i! You're

cent in the "Silver Screen" and Saint Mary's students edition were also copied, have certainly found that some word for word.

The game's creators, Chris Haney, Ed Werner and Scott Abbott, deny the allegation, although they and the game's New York manufacturer, Selchow & Righter have not filed a legal response in Los Angeles U.S. Dis­trict Court. Lawsuits only give one side of a case. 
Worth said he noticed duplicated questions while working on another book, Questions, for Warner Books. "I was told not to look at other games on the market (while writing the book)," he said. "When I turned in my manuscript, I decided to look at the other games, and the first one I picked up was Trivial Pursuit. 
"I said, 'Boy, this stuff sure looks familiar." 
Worth, who now writes for the ABC television game show "Trivia Trap," said he spent eight months documenting copied questions and information.

are the odds that the colors be in this order?" Worth 
said. 

He explained that his books deliberately contain 
some incorrect information as a precaution against 
plagiarism. Some ofthat information, he said, appears in 
the "Genus" edition of Trivial Pursuit, although he 
would not say where.

ND engineer studies dirt as building tool 


ND research team transplants mice bone marrow in rats 
Speclal to the Observer 
Rarely do we think of soil as a building material, much less as an engineer's research tool. But a Notre Dame engineer is using the Earth's surface to study two seemingly unr­elated topics: new ways of con­structing highway bridges and the durability of buried military com­mand stations in the event of a nu­clear explosion. 

t 
Michael Katona, professor of civil engineering and specialist in soil­structure analysis, is developing ana­lytical soil models to study both areas with funds from a National Sci­ence Foundation Presidential Young Investigator Award. The award pro­vides $100,000 annually for five years through matching funds from the NSF, private industry and the University.

Special to The Observer 
While doctors In Lorna Linda, Calif., have had success in the cross­species heart transplant of Baby Fae, researchers at Notre Dame have suc­cessfully crossed species In animal bone marrow transplants. 
The Notre Dame research team has achieved a I00 percent survival rate In a small group of laboratory rats that received bone marrow from mice. At the age of 300 days, the rats arc producing mouse blood with no signs ofgraft vs. host disease, the rejection of foreign tissue to whkh many transplant patients suc­cumb. 
"We have the cells of two species coexisting in a single animal," said Dr. Morris Pollard, director of the l.obund Laboratory, who is conduct­ing the bone marrow research with 
colleagues Phyllis Luckert and 
Andrea Wade. 
The animals used for the bone marrow transplants have been raised and maintained In germfree environments; the current success rate would be impossible with con­ventional animals. "But the point is," Pollard said, "that under optimum conditons, the interspecies transplantation of certain tissues is possible. lbis a unique application ofgermfree technology." 
He explained that the rejection phenomenon has been eliminated by first using lethal doses of radia­tion ( 1,000 roentgens) to destroy the rats' own immune systems. After inoculation with bone marrow cells from the mice, the rats no longer have the capacity to reject the new bone marrrow because their original immunity has been replaced with that ofthe donor mice. Current analytical data, Pollard added, indi­cates that the rats are producing mouse blood with normal levels of circulating red and white blood cells. 
Although the rats' current life spans are the longest ever achieved under these conditions, Pollard said examinations are being conducted to determine whether the rats have the ability to resist disease. Injec­tions of antigens will be used to de­termine whether the rats produce antibodies, and grafts will determine whether the rats accept new skin from both their own species and from mice.

the mouse bone marrow will produce anti-rat characteristics," Pollard said. 
The team's most recent success is the result ofresearch that originated in 1971 when bone marrow was suc­cessfully transplanted from one ge­netic strain of mice to another. The early transplants also proved the im­portance of germfree technology. The germfree strains of mice not only survived, but also experienced actual cures of leukemia and Hud­kins's disease. Conventional mice 
survived short periods, but eventu­ally died ofgraft vs. host disease. 
Six years ago, Pollard's research team performed its first bone mar­row transplants from mice to rats. Initially, the rats survived about 38 days. With improved techniques, Pollard said, the life spans increased beyond 100 days, a critical period following a bone marrow transplant. "The life span of red blood cells is about I00 days, if the animals don't

"The interaction of soil and steel working together provides the remarkable structural strength of the soil-steel bridge. It is a perfect example of a synergistic system be­cause neither the soil nor the steel alone can·come close to carrying the loads of the combined system," Katona said. 
While many of the existing cul­vert systems are constructed with sections of pipes bolted tightly to­gether, Katona is currently analyzing the use ofslotted joints, a recent in­novation which reduces the stress In deeply buried pipes having large diameters. 
The slotted joints allow the pipe's perimeter to contract a controlled amount as it Is buried. As a result, the soli compresses around the pipe and relieves much of the stress. In many cases, the slotted joint design can prevent the pipes from collapsing.

In spite of the current success with his research, Pollard said it is still too soon to determine specific practical applications, or how the results might relate to the the transplantation of solid organs such as hearts. "The fact that it can be done is a significant accomplish­ment," he explained. 
In the case of Baby Fae, Pollard said the infant's immune system is being suppressed with cyclosporine, an anti-rejection drug that could eventually cause kidney damage. "But what will be the response when they remove the cyclosporlne? Rejection? They have not eliminated the capacity of her body to reject the heart." 
"Sometimes the very young can be given a foreign antigen to which they will develop a tolerance. I cer­tainly hope this occurs with this in­fant," added Pollard.

Newsweek said that the plan "would be packaged as 'revenue­neutral' but almost surely would simplify taxes upward." 
The plan, Newsweek said in a news release describing the maga­zine article, "is to be submitted to Reagan within two weeks of his re­election." 
The November Project, the article said, was in existence shortly after 
month by California Secretary of State March Pong Eu, Cozad said. 
"John De Lorean paid for the ad," she said, adding that she did not know what it cost. "We were given the non-profit rate." 
De Lorean was not in Los Angeles and could not be contacted for com­ment Wednesday, said Karen Homer, secretary for Howard Weitzman, one of the attorneys who helped De Lorean win acquittal on the drug charges. 
It has been reported that De Lorean owed Weitzman and co­defense attorney Donald Re about n million, but Homer refused to comment on the amount. 
Weitzman and Re were not in­volved with the ad, Homer said.

FORT WAYNE, Ind. -Several hundred students in the Fort Wayne Community Schools boycotted classes this week to protest an im­passe in their teachers' contract talks. 
"We're here for the teachers, to help them out," said Vincent johnson, a senior at Snider High School. 
lbe students participated in sit­ins Wednesday at Snider, South Side and Wayne high schools. 
A spokesman said they were pro­testing the stalled negotiations and 
also a decision by some teachers not 
to perform voluntary extracur­
ricular duties until the dispute is ­
settled. 
Some 600 to 700 ofSnider's 2, I00 students participated at the begin­ning of the Snider gym sit-in, around 8:30a.m. 
Students were told by Principal Jerry Petrie that they could stay in the gym until the second class per­iod. The number in the gym had dwindled by 9:30 a.m., when Petrie asked students to either go to class or go home. 
Students who left school will be disciplined under the school's regu­lar polky for truants, said Russ Isaacs, an assistant to the principal.

Increased independence is destructive to society 
Does that ever happen to you as well? There's something bleary before your eyes, like sort of a vision and you just can't express it in words? That's how I feel about this column today. As often as I have set pen to paper to write a paragraph, I have scratched it out. So, please be a cooperative reader today. 
Recently, I was talking with one of my neighbors about the Food Cooperative that some people in the ~rsity Village: ~e 
Jurgen Brauer 
reasoned culture 
a number-of married graduate students live) 
are trying to set up. During our conversation 
she remarked that most people here in 
America are really only into making and 
saving money rather than into building, con­
tributing and supporting the particular com­
munity they happen to live in. Her comment 
of course wasn't unique: more and more 
measures are being taken to make people less 
dependent on each other giving each a chance 
to fulfill his individual desires. 
Money goes a long way to contribute towards that end. For example: Advanced means of transportation , like the automobile, have helped to make people independent of their Immediate neighbors and neighbor· hoods. Advanced means of communication, such as the telephone, have also added to this Independence. Nowadays we therefore can choose · still within limits-whom we desire to communicate with in spite ofspatial distance. This choice was not available in the past. One was basically stuck in the village or valley in which he was born. 
Advanced education allows people to 
become more flexible with respect to type 
and place of work. More importantly, it allows 
them to switch more easily from one job to 
another. This flexibility is a result of a wider 
fm:us In education. 
Advanced social services in the western, in­dustrialized countries permit people to rely on an anonymous society rather than on their Immediate neighbors. That is, society does not necessarily notice if and when the i ndivid­ual is poor or ill because government institu­tions are provided as a means of hiding poornes.o; or illness. 
In other words, the more advanced we become, the more independent we become. And the more independent we become, the less need we have for community. The less need we have for community, the more com­munities will break down and disappear, eventually leaving a society made up of indi­vidual parts that do not form a whole. What irk.<; me about this is that I just can't under­stand how people can do without communit­ies and neighbors. 
How can people justify associating with the joneses until fed up with them, moving on to the Smiths, and later the Browns and so forth? 
To me it's like going shopping. This is using 
people rather than valuing them and by the 
same token it's being used instead of being 
valued for what one is. 
Let me throw in a few examples that may 
help to make the point. Why should I buy and 
own my own car if my neighbor has one? Am I 
presumptuous? How can I justify making 
claims on my neighbor's car? Well, I don't jus­
tify it. I just invite my neighbors to make use of 
my vacuum cleaner and my piano whenever 
they need either one. Of course, we can't 
move the piano around very well, but then I 
certainly don't mind my neighbors popping 
in. 
I can't come up with any good reason why I 
should not share -and vice versa of course. 
Indeed, they usually do and so do I. And yet 
there appears to be a limit ofjust how far one 
can go with this idea of neighborly sharing of 
one's resources. Further it appears that this 
limit is reached fairly quickly in our society. 
In some African societies where I used to 
live, things were often just the other way 
around. For economic reasons, people often 
just couldn't be independent of their 
respective communities. Often they would 
depend so much on each other that I had trou­
ble discerning just how an individual is distin­
guishable from his community. The 
individual's life apparently was defined in and 
through his community. It is, of course, my 
own up-bringing and background that leads 
me to feel uncomfortable with either ·ex­
treme. 
And yet, I would argue that there's more 
than that involved. While the poor African 
can't achieve more independence, the gener· 
ally rich American could easily opt for more 
inter-dependence with his neighbors. Instead 
he chooses to evade, rather than face his 
neighbor. The above mentioned transporta­
tion and communication features ofadvanced 
civilization make that option an easy one to 
pursue. But it is not only the possibility to 
evade others by going away from them; in ad­
vanced society one is able to build a fence 
around oneself and thus to exclude people. 
The typical American campus, for example is unlike its European counterpart in that it is a fairly well-defined geographical area sur­rounded by distinct lines ofdemarcation like a fence and walls. Notre Dame is thus distin­guishing itself from the rest ofSouth Bend as is IUSB and so on. In my mind that certainly does not contribute to developing community relationships. 
Well, this column is getting long and as I said at the very beginning I just don't feel I have said what it really is that irks me. But per­haps you feel,like me, that increased indepen· dence frees and separates us from people rather than bringing us closer to them. I feel the former to be destructive to society and the latter to be constructive.

search of who we are =-6ut cari we define our 
true self-identity in the mundane and trivial 
occurences ofour dai_ly lives?_ 
It may sound as though I am babbling like some sort of idyllic idiot; I guess there is a grain of truth in that assertion. Yet, keep in mind that we confine most of our thoughts with things which will have little or no impor­tance in the long run of our lifetimes. Still, these things seem like life or death matters. I am amazed that so many of the special things in our lives are often neglected or given mini· mal weight rather than being put into the posi­tion ofcentrality which they deserve. 
There are two things which separate people from the dull and inanimate matter in this world: life and love. Without some measure of each, we are nothing but dust upon the landscape. Yet, it is the humanness of our life and our ability to love which makes us ep­hemeral and mere temporary inhabitants of this planet. 
It is the spark oflife which gives our bodily water, salts and carbon the capability to speak, think, create, and most importantly of all ­love. Poets, politicians and people of all shapes and backgrounds have tried to quan­tify, comprehend and explain love. While their attempts have been both admirable and thought provoking, they have failed, just as they have been unable and incapable of truly grasping the meaning of life. 
As human beings, life and love are most pre­cious things which we can hold onto for a very brief increment of time. We are but grains of sand in the hourglass oftime. Try as we might, we can never make the sand defy gravity and go back up, nor can we freeze it in time and space. If we dwell on what has past, we stand to neglect the present and miss completely the things which lie in the future. life and love are the most special things in the universe. Yet, we experience but a small portion of them each day. Think of each day as a colored thread which while being inconspicuous and unimportant on its own is part of a beautiful tapestry which tells the tale of human exis­tence. 
I am no Aesop and this is not a fable, but there is a moral to my seeming madness. Enjoy today for what it is, do not neglect the unique­ness ofthe people in it and do not fail to appre­ciate the love which exists around you. These are the most important things in the world, try not to make them take the back seat because 

.,1 
of Inconsequential feelings or events. Even 

.,
though today may appear to be but a speck 

,
when viewed In terms of the continuum of human existence, think of it as a bridge be· 1
,
tween all that has come before and that which ,lies in the midst ofthe future. Even though the ,real and special things of today may not be 
1
easily ascertained, they do exist and they serve as both the supports to the bridge and the motive force which brings us across it. Remove the notions of career, power and public opinion so that you may become more capable of reaching out and drawing close those people and things which are truly spe· cia! and important. 
Normally, my columns deal with issues and events in the political realm. While the Impor­tance of these things is unquestioned, some­thing else has drawn my thoughts away from them and closer to home. All during the pa-;t week, the life of a most beloved and special person has hung in the balance. The notion that I might lose this person, who is so deeply responsible for all that I am, is ultimately frightening and painful. For obvious reasons, little else seemed to matter. 

Questions involving the loss of the life of a loved one are the gravest that a human being can ever experience. All other things which might normally seem important are shown to be both passing and of limited consequence. So I stand today with a sobering sense of the essential nature of life and love. I leave inter­preting these things to philosophers, scien· ~ 
,
tists, and theologians. While my understanding may be ever so 1 
1
limited, there are a few things that I am certain 
l

of: To show our appreciation for love and life we have some obligations a~ human beings. Where life is concerned, we must live each 1., day to the fullest, taking only those things we 
,l 
need for our existence and immediate happi­ness. We are merely temporary dwellers on , this planet and we must share its riches with , everyone else, as well as maintaining a vast reserve for those who will come after us. Where love is concerned, we must not hold onto it for our own ends, rather it is something which we can only receive if we are willing to give it away. While our hearts and souls are the storehouses of love, we must not seek to make them like Fort Knox so that no one gets in to share in all of the treasure. Rather, we must keep the seat ofour love open to all who might wish to partake. 
When it comes to life and love, the key to appreciation and understanding is living each day to the fullest. That way, if you ever find one or both of these thing.~ in serious jeopardy, you can find solace in the fact that while they are your's for an uncertainly brief period of time, you were wise enough to get the greatest benefits possible during the time they were ·in your grasp. It was this notion which got me through what may have been the most difficult week In my life.

Why and how brain cells die 
by Stephanie Siegel 
features staff writer 
A
lcohol plays a major role in social situations in colleges and universities around this country. The exact role it does and should play at Notre Dame entered the limelight last year with the new alcohol policy. 
This policy provoked scores ofcomplaints from students who felt the administration was trying to take the place ofabsent parents. One wonders ifthat issue was overshadowing other concerns, one ofwhich is the possible ill effects ofdrinking. 
The biochemical effects ofdrinking are not common knowledge among students. There: is some awareness, as is evidenced in a phrase used lightly by many, "Let's go kill some brain cells." How many ofthese people really think that this is just what they could be doing when they go out drinking? 
The actual damage w the brain caused by alcohol consumption
r 
is unknown. Evidence exists suggelliting that alcohol affects the 
I" 
hippocampus and cer·~bellum, areas involved with learning,r memory, and motor coordination.
r 
Tests conducted on rats showed that after five months of
r 
nutritionally balanced. diets containing alcohol (ethanol),
r 
considerable loss ofhi.ppocampal pyramidal and cerebellar r Purkinje cells occurred. r Many heavy drinkers realize that alcohol causes ill effects. A r common example is title hangover on the morning after a night of r heavy drinking. A hangover usually involves headache, nausea, r sweating, and tremor5.. The exact cause ofhangovers is not known r but hypotheses exist. One maintains that they are reactions to toxic r properties ofethanol and cogeners, contents ofalcohol. The body 
r 
r 
becomes overloaded 'Mth heavy drinking. It works to dispose of
r 
the toxic substances as fast as it can, but these affect the body
r 
before they depart. Another hypothesis holds that a hangover is a form ofwithdrawal 
dependent upon the amount ofalcohol consumed. f Alcohol is a depres5ant. Despite this, at low doses the consumer r can find enjoyment. This is caused by inhibitions reduced by the 
alcohol. People experience euphoria, reduced tension, and greater ease in social interaction. These may be thought ofas "positive" effects,. 


However, they are accompanied by impaired attention and disruption in balance. At this time blood alcohol level is usually around 50 mgldL. From a level of 100-1 50 mgldL, there is a loss in coordination, impaired mental skills and short-term memory, and slurred speech. It is at this level and above that the majority of driving accidents occur. At the 50 mg/dL level, driving capabilities are not necessarily !oM, but accidents can and do occur, perhaps because there is an in:reased tendency to take risks. 
There are even greater bodily effects as the drinker increases blood alcohol levels. It is above a level of250 mgldL that consciousness is lost. Even more dangerous is ifthe level goes above 500 mg/dL. Over this level, death can occur, in most cases due to heart failure. A drinker can't ignore the effects that alcohol has on this very important organ. 
Ethanol has been shown to have adverse effects on the left ventrical of the heart :ven ifthe drinker is in a state ofoniy mild intoxication. Larger doses impair the heart's ability to contract. This progresses with the rise in blood alcohol levels. Prolonged alcohol abuse increases the possibility ofheart disease. This is treatable with sufficient periods ofabstaining from alcohol consumption. Howev·er, it is possible that with a weakened heart, in a severe state ofintoxication death could result from cardiac arrest, even ifblood alcohol level isn't as high as the level previously stated. 
Not quite so dramal:ic effects ofalcohol use and abuse are those experienced by many students. Examples are "cottonmouth" and stomach pains. "Cottonmouth" is a result ofethanol inhibiting the flow ofsaliva. This doesn't happen right away, since initially ethanol stimulates thi:> flow. When it does interfere, it takes time to reverse the dehydration. Therefore ifone feels thirsty, the worst thing to drink is an al<:oholic beventge. This will only make the thirst worse later. 
Alcohol stimulates 1the flow ofgastric juice as well. The flow increases the acidic content of the stomach. This is independent of the normal releasing mechanisms and gastric ulcers can occur from the increased daily and maximal flow ofgastric juice. Often aspirin is taken to relieve the headache, but it reacts to the acid content and so aggravates the stomach and makes gastric injury more likely. 
Afar less severe, but much more immediate and common effect ofdrinking is having to urinate more than usual. Alcohol tends to inhibit the workings ofthe hormones which control the kidney. Normally, the kidney's many distal convoluted tubules re-absorb water in a carefully balanced osmotic proctss. Alcohol disrupts this process, causing a buildup ofwater in the kidneys. Urinating frequently also may d·::prive cells ofwater they need to function, and according to one theory, this may contribute to the "hangover headache." In addition, the lack ofwater may contribute to "cottonmouth." 
One doesn't have to be an alcoholic to suffer from diseases related to alcohol consumption. The college situation causes some students to consume alcohol on a regular basis and in sufficient quantities to produce effects above and beyond the average hangover. It would be wise to stop and think what that "one more drink" might mean the next day. Health is a gift not to be thrown away. Learning responsible alcohol use is impottant.

Stupidity leads to evil 

features columnist 
Letters to a 
A
n artist once drew a picture of the ()evil's face with the evil showing through. The face was fri~htenln~. not because it was distorted like the features ofa vic­tim from "The Exorcist," but because it wa.' so stupid lookin~. like a parody of idiocy. 
The more vou looked at Satan, 
the worse you.felt, fearful of the subhuman countenance masking a mali~nantly mischievous intelli­~ence dangerous to the rational order which keeps the world balanced. You could learn a half· truth from this leon ofevil: seeing the devil looking so dumb, you could conclude, from his appear­ance, that he's an ass. It would he a mistake to underestimate the cun­ningness of the father oflies. I'm not sure If the devil exists as a personal being, a counter-force to God, a fallen angel bent on ruining us. 
I'm afraid to say he doesn't exist. If he's a real spiritual agent majoring in damnation, hl' would love to catch me off guard that way. Bibli­cal mythology denounces him as an enemy of<iod. When I'm on the point ofde-mythologizing him out ofexistence, I feel sure he's cloud· ing my mind with the error that he's as insubstantial as a Halloween ghost. 
The devil, if he exists, must he an ass, though he is also tricky. Evil, when you think ofIt, looks stupid and banal, and that's how it hides its vldous face. Someone paints the toe nails purple on the statue of Moses by the library. On the day before the statue of Moses was dl·dkatl·d, while it was still covered with canva.~ before its unveiling, soml·one stretched a contraceptive over the upraised finger of the patrlach. Apractical joker wanted to make a statement or cause em­harrassml'nl with a tasteless prank. Would Satan waste his time with such a cheap shot? It wouldn't surprise me, because he's such a guttersnipe. 
Durin~ Vietnam, demonstrators painted the peace sign on some of our religious statues, and a peacenik broke a panel ofcentury-old stained 
Shakespeare performance 
glass in a window.overiookiniihe porch of the Main Building. A few years ago, a fanatic did a hatchet job on the Pieta at St. Peter's. Another 
nut took a knife to the Rembrandt painting ofthe "Night Watch" at the 
National Museum in Amsterdam. 
Vandals are at work everywhere, leaving signatures ofrage on landmarks. Dlsfiguration is one of the facts oflife we get used to in a crazy world, and the destruction is so stupid we hate it. You don't get bent out ofshape every time a teenager paints a moustache on the faces ofa subway billboard, though we would be angry ifhe tried to improve the smile of the Mona Usa. When the kids are having fun with masterpieces, you have to wonder who's poisoning the air with temptations to sacrilege. 
Hardships become so com­monplace, you stop noticing them. Once in New York, I found myself stepping through the derelicts like a ballet dancer, though they were asking my help. I realized I was treating them like obstacles instead ofpeople. Derelicts are human beings who have given up trying. Maybe they're to blame for their condition; maybe they've never gotten any of the breaks; maybe life has treated them shabbily. Whatever the reasons for their dereliction, it upset me to find I was acting as though they were less than human, ignoring them as though I had stopped seeing how tragic they are. 
Persecutions begin when good people ignore the indignities and injustices offered to the minorities. I'm no expert on the Holocaust, hut from what I've read, theJews were excluded from the social scene, then the schools, then the market place. Soon, there were laws against inter-marriage. Then, there was the decision to herd them together in the ghettoes. Finally, they were on their way to the final solution dreamed up hy a mad man. It just took a few years for a totalitarian regime to establish the death camps, because when the Nazi bullies he~an beatin~ up theJews, 
Ellsworld 
they were shrugged offby the Aryan members of the master race as unimportant. Horror hid itself under routines that seemed so ordinary that people didn't look where they were leading. 
Later Christians could absolve themselves from guilt saying: "We didn't know what was happening." Some of the greatest moral monsters of Hitler's party had the appearance offunny little com· edians who got tears in their eyes when they heard a Strauss waltz. Evil incarnates itselfin the ordinary. The ordinary makes you think that nothing is happening you can't live with. The slight headache I have from drinking hardly seems like a warning I'm on my way to becom­ing a drunk. The fun I'm having as a young person with "loving them and leaving them" is too enjoyable to make me worry about forming the habits ofa sexual glutton, in­capable offulfilling an emotional commitment. 
I don't hunt for sin where there is no sin, which would be the greatest sin ofaU. I read the headlines of horror, one on top of the other, in the daily paper. None ofwhat the papers say is bad, but there is a lot ofstupidity among us. Stupidity does undercover work for evil. A stoned driver getting behind the wheel ofa car is lethal, though he's as good as gold. An 18-year-old, wandering around by herself after an evening ofgin and tonics, may be as wholesome as an angel, but she can still spoil her life with the risks she's taking. 
Sin is a theological word th<tt 
makes us impatient. Dumb is the way we describe a roommate w lo steals diamonds from Tiffany's. Many a promising career is nippet in the bud by the ways ofdumb­ness. lbe road to hell is probably paved with dumb intentions. The dumb bunnies are likely candidates for the eternal fires or regret. The Devil, looking like a malevolent clown, is as smart as a fox. We are hroadminded and tolerant of monkey-shines, until, to our surprise, we find that Satan has twisted them into sacraments of hate. 
It's a tricky world, booby-trapped 
with landmines. Our fun and games 
can end with a list ofvictims, unless 
we play by the rules and use a net. I 
hope it doesn't make me sound like 
a Jansenist to say so.

High-scoring Dantley goes back to Jazz 
Associated Press 
SALT LAKE CITY High-scoring star forward Adrian Dantley ended his two-month standoff with the Utah Jazz yesterday, agreeing to honor the final year of his contract with the National Basketball Associ­ation franchise. 
In return, the Jazz will extend Dantley's contract, signed in 1980, for three more years through the 1987-88 season, team officials said. 
Dantley was scheduled to un­dergo a physical examination yester­day, ending a sometimes acrimonious impasse between last season's NBA Comeback Player of the Year and the team -a contract squabble at times punctuated by harsh criticism ofthe 6-5 forward by Jazz coach Frank Layden.

Trout, Aase get most attention at free-agent draft 
A..'iSOClated Press 
NEW YORK-Pitchers Steve Trout ofthe Chicago Cubs and Don Aase of the California Angels attracted more attention yesterday than Rick Sutcliffe and Fred Lynn, their bigger-name and higher-priced teammates available at major league baseball's free-agent draft. 
Sutcliffe won the Cy Young Award as the National League's premier pitcher following a 16-1 perfor­mance that helped the Cubs win their first title of any kind in 39 years, the NL East flag. But Trout helped, too, with a 13-7 record. 
Lynn was fifth on the Angels in batting with a .270 average. His 23 home runs tied him for second on the club and he was fourth in runs­batted-in with 79. 
But Aase, a reliever rebounding from elbow surgery, was instrumen­tal, too, in keeping the Angels in the American League West pennant race by going 4-1 with eight saves and a 
1.62 earned-run-average.

So, in the 51 minutes that the major leagues ran through the list of 56 eligible free agents, Trout was se­lected a draft-leading 17 times and Aase's name was called out by 13 clubs. That compared to the eight times Sutcliffe was picked and five times Lynn was chosen. 
Some other big-name players likewise were ignored by a majority of the teams. 
Bruce Sutter, the relief ace ( 45 saves, l.54 ERA) for the St. Louis Cardinals, was chosen by six teams, and designated hitter-first baseman Andre Thornton (33 homers, 99 RBI's) of the Cleveland Indians was chosen by seven. 
Three teams-the Cubs, New York Mets and World Champion Detroit Tigers -ignored the draft entirely, passing on the first rwo rounds to eliminate themselves from selecting in subsequent rounds.

guard Joe Howard, busy with the football team right now, won't play Sunday, but will join the team after the football season ends. 
The frontcourt, aside from Kempton's injury, poses less of a concern for Phelps at this point of the season. 
"We've got the talent and the depth to pound people up front," says Phelps. "I think there were only six or seven teams that out­rebounded us last year (the Irish outrebounded their opponents by an average margin of seven per ~arne, sixth best in the NCAA: last 
Houston made just one selection, Philadelphia outfielder Sixto Lez­cano, and Minnesota selected only Thornton before bowing out. The last team to pick was Texas, taking Toronto designated hitter-catcher CliffJohnson in the 21st round. The Rangers then passed rwice, ending the draft after 23 rounds. 
Several club executives ex­pressed the opinion that Sutter and Sutcliffe, rwo of the jewels in this draft, were ignored by most teams because of their price tags and the likelihood they will re-sign with their 1984 teams. 
The rwo other "double-figure" free agents were outfielder Lee Lacy of Pittsburgh, chosen by 14 teams following a season in which he batted .321 with 12 homers and 70 RBI's, and San Diego pitcher Ed Whitson, named by I 1 teams after his 14-8 season and 3.23 ERA for the 
year), so we've proven we can domi­nate the boards with the people we've got coming back." 
While Phelps will be missing only Kempton because of injury for Sun­day's game, DiStanislao could be without the services of as many as four ofher players. 
Defimtely out of the line-up for Sunday is 5-6 freshman guard Mary Gavin, a product of Wildwood Cath­olic High School in Wildwood, N.J. Gavin, who was named by USA Today as one of the top 25 high school players in the nation, has been unable to practice all season because of a knee injury suffered over the summer.

"I think she's going to beao1e to come back and turn in a decent season for us." 
Questionable for Sunday are soph· omore guard Vonnie Thompson (possible stress fracture of foot), senior guard and co-captain Laura Dougherty (reaggravated ankle in­jury)and senior forward Ruth Kaiser (bruised calf). 
DiStanislao has not yet set her line-ups for Sunday, mostly because of the injury situation. 
"There's a lot of inbalance in the line-up at this point because of the tenuous guard situation," says DiS­tanislao. "We have different people filling in different spots. 
"So it's going to be really interest­ing to see ;ust what happens. I don't think any starting spot is going to be written in stone for a while, until we find out who's healthy and who's able to perform best In those spots." 
With three veterans injured, DiS­

"Kathy Brommeland has been very sick lately. She was out for two weeks of practice with a pretty in­tense stomach virus. So she's on the mend now -we'll see how she does."

An exhausting position 
Ding~ens plays dual role on defense 
By MICHAEL}. tCHMIEL 
Sports Writer 
The defensive tackle is one of the cornerstones of the defensive unit on a football team. The tackle must confront linemen from the offensive side who are usually larger as well as various types ofblocking schemes in an effort to find the ball and halt its progress towards h1is own goal. 
The position is extremely ex­hausting and often requires the services of more than one player to fill the position during a game. Playing a key role on the Notre Dame squad since his freshman year has been junior defensive tackle Greg Dingens. 
Dingens, a 6-5, 2~>4-pound Bloom­field Hills, Mich., native, has played in every game while at Notre Dame except the first game of the 1982 season against Michigan. Last year, he started four games for the Irish, including the Liberty Bowl win over Boston College, when he played contain tackle. 
This year, Dingen:s has been an im­portant figure on the defensive line, as he splits time with sophomore Wally Kleine, playing a type of swing-tackle which keeps the defen­sive front strong and fresh on every play from scrimmage. 
"I consider ( Din:gens) a starting player," said Irish defensive line coach Rick Lantz. "When he comes into the game, he's fresh and can go full speed so that (he and Kleine) don't have to go 80 plays a game. I think he is a stabili;~ing factor with the defensive team." 
While Dingens does not start, he does gets to play a good deal and is able to contibute a great amount to the team's effort. 
"I basically split time with Wally and, theoretically, I'm supposed to be playing as much time as Wally, al­though it hasn't n1rned out that way," said Dingens. "I play enough to get into the game and really make a contribution, so that's good enough for me." 
According to Lantz, the main rea­son why Kleine is pbying in front of Dingens is because he got a slight jump on him in the spring when the junior.decided to hit the books hard for a while. Additionally, as Dingens can play on either side of the line, the value of the role he plays is

ing only two places further back as he posted a career-bt:st time. 
Notre Dame pbced its five scoring runners in the top 23 at this meet. This consistency enabled the Irish to overcome Southeast Mis­souri State, which had three runners in the top six. 
Two weeks later, Notre Dame defeated Purdue and Indiana in the Indiana Intercolleg~iate Meet by scoring only 36 points. Cannon ran to a great second-place finish, but Garrett and Courtney led the Irish to victory by passing three Purdue run­ners at the four-mile mark and staying ahead until the finish. Again, the Irish placed all five scoring run­ners in the top 15, and all seven run­ners finished in the top 24. 

Next, Notre Dame won the Midwestern City Conference Cham­pionships, accumul~Lting only 21 . points. Cannon won the individual title, while the five Irish scoring run­ners finished in the top seven. In fact, the Irish were allowed to enter extra men and their top 11 placed in the top 18 overall. 
The Irish haven't qualified for the 
NCAA's during Piane's ten-year 

career at Notre Dame. Last year, if 
each Irish runner had finished 30 
meters better, Notrt: Dame would 
have qualified. This could well be 
the year that Notre Dame qualifies 
for the chance to do what the 1957 
Irish team did: win the NCAA Cross-
Country National Championship. 
greatly increased. Lantz, neverthe­
less, takes nothing away from the 
veteran's ability to start, or just fill in 
anywhere as ifhe were starting. 
"He can go in and play any of the 
positions," said Lantz. "He under­
stands the game -it's logical to him, 
so he can go in and play wherever 
we need him to play. He gives us 
depth because he can play on either 
side, and he's the only one that I 
really ask to do that." 
Dingens, who carries a 3.70 grade point average, earned a perfect 4.0 last spring. The junior, who led Brot­her Rice High School in Birming­ham, Mich., to a 27-3 record in the three years he played there, has a freshman brother, Matt, on the Notre Dame squad, also. --B~icilly, Dingens enjoys playing 
on the right side ofthe line where he 
can follow the play and make some 
good hits. 
"I like the right side because that's 
where I played last year and most of 
my career," said Dingens. "What I 
like doing the best is playing football 
after the initial hit and after you read 
what the offense is doing... just get­
ting to the ball and making some 
plays." 
Other than being a key figure to 
the defensive front, Dingens also is 
pleased and impressed with his 
coaches. Although many of the 
defenses used are complicated, he 
believes in the people dictating the 
orders. 
"(Defensive coordinator Andy 
Christoff) is doing a fine job," Din­gens said. "He likes a very compl­icated defense where how we play depends upon the formations that the offense comes into. We will of­ten call the defense and then make several checks. At first, that was hard .fur us to handle because we weren't 
used to it to such an extent, but now we're getting used to it. 
"For Coach Lantz, I have a lot of respect. I think that he is excellent at his position, and I really admire him. He's got a personality and knowl­edge that I like." 
For the rest of this season, Din­gens still maintains hopes of a bowl bid, and is confident that he will con­tinue to play a great deal and be a strong contributor to the total Irish effort. Against Penn State, he believes that Notre-Dame will have a score to settle. 
"The key to beating Penn State ob­viously will be to go out there and play an intense game with emotion and without some of the dumb mistakes that have plagued us," said Dingens. "I think that we've got to go out and play like we did against LSU. It seems like we've outplayed them each of the last two years and still got beat. We're ready to finally win one against them, to do more than justpush them all over the field. 
"(Overall) I don't think there's been anything that has really sparked us, except that on some weeks the team really decides to jell and play together, while on other weeks, we seem more disoriented. We've got to keep that unity to keep winning, and if we don't, we'll be in trouble." 
After finishing second on the squad last year in tackles for a Joss, with five, the junior has already had three this year, including a sack for a 10-yard loss in the Navy game. Aiming to make a significant contri­bution in each game that he plays in, the Arts and Letters Pre-Professional major will use up his final year of eligibility next year, and hopes to go on to medical school to study or­thopedic surgery.

on them than in the past and we have 
higher expectations of them. 
"My goal this year is to get the maximum out ofour material, which I do not think has been done in the past. I do not know what their poten­tial is yet, but there is no doubt in my mind that we will get the maximum out of them." 
In addition to personnel changes, the Irish are upgrading their schedule to include a higher level of competition. Although a gradual process, the upgrade should permit Notre Dame to wrestle a predominantly top-20 schedule within three to four years. Nebraska is on tap this season, Michigan and Michigan State will be added next year, and Wisconsin w"l be picked up the following seaso~a. 
"In order for us to achieve our goals, one ofwhich is to be in the top 20, we must have the competition," commented McCann. "To be realis­tic, we are not in that league right no.w, but the future is going to be dif­ferent. I will guarantee it." 
In an attempt to live up to his words, McCann has been working the wrestlers since the first week in Srptember, and to this point in time he is basically happy with their prog­ress. 
"We had an excellent preseason; we were pleased. Our main concern now is that they understand our phi­losophy and what we are trying to teach," he stated. "They are working extremely hard, and there is not any doubt in my mind that as the year progresses we will see improve­ment." 
Competing with Notre Dame and Michigan State this weekend will be Indiana State, Eastern Illinois, Nor­thern Michigan, Central Michigan, Eastern Michigan, Ferris State and Division III champion Brockport State. The Spartans and the Sycamores are favoured for team honors as they have maintained a virtual monopoly on the team cham­pionship during the tournament's eight-year history. 
Having earned the right to com­pete this weekend in the 118-lb. class is Fleming, while at 126 pounds Crown currently is in the first spot. 
Freshman Ron Wisniewski won a 
starting birth in the 134-lb. class, and 
at 142 pounds senior Don Heintzel­
man will be starting his fourth var­
sity season for the Irish. 
Battling at 150 pounds will be 
junior Luke DiSabato, while fresh­
man Ken Kasler gets his first varsity 
experience in the 1 58-lb. class. 
At 167 pounds, sophomore Tom Ryan will be the number-one man, and senior captain Phil Baty gets the call at 177 pounds. 
Junior John Krug will do the honors in the 190-lb. class, but, due to injury and lack of personnel, the Irish will forfeit in the Unlimited class. 
"Everyone is working pretty hard, so the team attitude is positive and we are in the right frame of mind for this tournament," commented Baty. "Hopefully some good things will happen this year, but we will see this weekend." 
"It is a pretty tough tournament for us this early," added McCann, "but they are working their tails off, and they will be ready." 
The MSU Invite will allow 
McCann to see how well his teach­
ing has taken effect. Although he 
looks to this weekend more for ex­
perience than for wins or losses, he 
feels that the aggressive style which 
he advocates together with the 
squad's desire to win could indeed 
provide for some surprises.

Two wins under belt 


Irish travel to Michigan-Dearborn 
By ED DOMANSKY 
Sports Writer 
DEARBORN, Mich.· After a suc­cessful season debut on its home ice, the Notre Dame hockey team takes to the road tonight and tomorrow to take on the Wolves of the University of Michigan-Dearborn. 
Two convincing wins, 8-2 and 10­3, over Penn State in the first series of the 1984-85 season, provide a sound foundation for the Irish to build on as the schedule will only get tougher in the weeks to come. Dearborn should be the season's first big challenge for Notre Dame. 
Last season Dearborn compiled only an 18-20-0 record, but sported an impressive 11-4 mark on its home ice. Notre Dame handed the Wolves two of those four losses as it swept Dearborn, 6-4 and 4-3, in a series played over Thanksgiving weekend. The two teams then split their series at Notre Dame in late February. Dearborn took the first game, 4-3, with the Irish bouncing back the second night to win, 7-4. 
Dearborn has played its last five games on the road and is anxious to return to the friendly confines ofits home arena. With only a 2-4 record to show for their efforts, the Wolves are eager to show their home fans that they are a better team than their early play would indicate. 
Splits with two Central Collegiate 
Bring back Sonmor 
Hockey Association teams for Dear­born is a definite sign for the Irish that they will have their hands full this weekend. The Wolves have beaten Miami of Ohio and Ferris State by 5-4 and 5·2 scores, respectively. Earlier this year, Ferris swept a series from defending NCAA champion Bowling Green on the Fal­cons' home ice. 
"Dearborn will be a much better 
team than we saw in Penn State," 
said Notre Dame coach Lefty Smith. 
"We're expecting more quickness 
from them. And because it's the first 
road series of the season, it will be a 
real challenge for us." 
This weekend the Irish hope to cut down on the number of penalties they receive each game. In last weekend's two contests, Notre Dame was whistled for 34 infrac­tions. 
"Dearborn will be a lot tougher team than Penn State, so we'll have to cut down on mistakes like penalties," said junior Jeff Badalich. "Things like that could really hurt against a better team." 
Four of Notre Dame's six fresh­men picked up their first goals for the Irish last weekend, but tonight will mark their first journey from home. Smith is anxious to see how they meet this new challenge. 
"All six did a much better job than I had hoped for in their first col­legiate series," said Smith. "A key in any sport and the mark of a real ath· lete is how they can do away from the friendly confines." 
Co-captains Brent Chapman and Bob Thebeau led the Irish against Penn State as each registered a three-goal hat trick. Chapman did it in the opener and Thebeau dupl­icated the feat the following eve­ning. Steve Ely and Tim Reilly also turned in solid performances and are being counted on again for their support. 
In the goaltending department, sophomore Tim Lukenda, who earned his first victory last Friday in the season opener, will be in the net tonight. Senior AI Haverkamp, the winner in Saturday's contest, most likely will get the call tomorrow. 
The injury column contained its share of names after last Friday's game, but both Badalich and Rob Ricci, who were forced to miss Sat­urday's game with shoulder and thigh injuries, respectively, will be back in the line-up this weekend. Tom Parent separated his shoulder on Saturday and will be out ofaction for four to six weeks. Freshman Mark Anquillare will move up and center the third line in Parent's place. 
The Irish are once again ready to play, and with Dearborn marking the season's first big test as well as the first road trip, the team is anxious to see if it can maintain its perfect record. 



North Stars fire Mahoney as coach 
Associated Press 
BLOOMINGTON, Minn. · The Minnesota North Stars, mired in last place in the National Hockey League's Norris Division, fired Coach Bill Mahoney yesterday and replaced him with Glen Sonmor, their most successful coach before he quit inJanuary, 1983. 
"It makes me feel good," Sonmor said at a' news conference. "I've regained the enthusiasm and zest that I had lost when I stepped down." 
The change was announced by Lou Nanne, general manager and an­other former North Stars coach. Nanne said Mahoney, who steered the team to the division title last season, was hard-working and in­tense and had given a great deal of himselfto the club. 
"But we all know it's part of the 
game," Nanne said of the switch. 
Mahoney, he said, "got behind the eight-ball" early this season when several players were out with injur­ies. The general manager said player enthusiasm drops when a team is losing. 
Mahoney, who waas not at the news conference, told a reporter af. terwards, ''I'm prepared to accept the verdict of my actions. lbere really were some unfortunate hap­penings this fall that led to what hap­pened. We had some injuries, and

"I did feel the situation was begin­
ning to come under control. But that 
was my view, a view not shared by 
others in the organization." 
Sonmor coached the team for 
four-and-a-half seasons, beginning in 
November, 1978 and continuing un­
til he left in January, 1983, citing 
health reasons. He said at the news 
conference that he had since been 
dealing with alcoholism, was proud 
of what he had accomplished in that

handle coaching again. 
While the owners had not demanded a change or told him what to do, Nanne said they are astute businessmen and don't want to lose a lot of money. Attendance waned recently while the team played eight straight games without a victory, and some fans departed well before the games were over. 
Sonmor, 56, coached 348 North Stars games, more than any coach in the club's history. His teams won 152 games, lost 125 and tied 71 for a percentage of .539. His 1980-81 squad was the only Minnesota team to play in the Stanley Cup Finals. The following year, he coached the Stars to their first division championship. 
Sonmor said one of his goals will be to put more stress on the strengths, "the positive side," of players.

Rowing club grows out of huntble start in 1965 
By MARlY BURNS 
Sports Writer 
Unless one gets up with the birds and the Notre Dame campus groundskeepers in the morning, he may not know mu:h about the Notre Dame Rowing Club. This is because while most students are sleeping soundly at sunrise, the· members of the rowing club, or "crew" as it is commonly termed, are running two miles to St. Joseph's River to begin a grueling two-hour practice. 
Yet it is not so much the discipline of the members which makes this club sport unique, but rather the efficiency with which the complex organization ofthe club runs and the steady improvement of the team from humble beginnings to national competitiveness. 
In fact, in many ways the success of the rowing club correlates di­rectly with the degree of its organi­zation. Because of tht: fact that crew is the largest club sport at Notre Dame, with close to 125 members and a budget of ne~.rly $40,000 a year, it is especially difficult to main­tain smooth operation and to keep everyone rowing. Fo1r this reason, a large organization has evolved, con­sistingofa team captain, a club presi­dent, two operational vice-presidents to handle transpor­tation, one vice-president for alumni relations, two secretaries to schedule meets and a treasurer. 
As for team organization, there are four basic divisions. The main branch is men's varsi1ty, which now consists of 24 men, but which will be expanded in the spring. The wo­men's varsity, which includes Saint Mary's rowers, has 10 women, but also will be expanded for the spring season. 
The bulk of the club lies in the men's and women's novice divi­sions, with roughly 60 men and 40 women, respectively. While the novice divisions do practice with the varsity, they gen~rally compete in separate races. 
The intricate struclture ofthe club was necessitated by the increasingly large participation in crew. However, it has not always been this way. 
In 1965, the Notrt: Dame Rowing Club was formed by a dozen or so men who hitchhiked to races be­cause they had no money to pay for group transportation. In the 1970's, it continued to grow in number, and this decade has seen the club make its greatest advancements: participa­tion by over 100 rowers and the construction of a brand new S40,000 boat house on St. Joseph's River. 
With these improvements in the club, the product on the water has similiarly excelled. While in the past years the team has not performed on a highly competitive level, this year things began to change. 
Over an autumn "head season" 

which sponsors longer three-mile 
races, the men's varsity competed in 

four regattas, performing well in 
each of them. The most gratifying 

showing was at a regatta in Boston 
earlier in the season, where the Irish 

posted an 18th-place finish in a field 
of40 teams. 
In that race, only one minute 

separated the first place finisher 
from the Notre Dame squad. As it 
was, the time set a new Notre Dame 
Rowing Club record. It also inspired 
the team to aim for even loftier 
things. 

"Our goal for the fall was to break the record time and we accom­plished that," said men's team cap­tain John Younger. "We are getting faster and faster. We hope that within three years we will be at the caliber ofHarvard and Yale. 
"Going mto this tall, we were very serious about it. We're getting much better prepared because we're com­peting so strongly this fall." 
The Irish rowers also finished first in the Des Moines International Regatta, and proved to be a for­midable opponent in their two other meets, the Head of Tennessee Regatta and the Head of Schuylkill Regatta in Philadelphia. 
As-for the women's crew and the novice teams, their competition has been less frequent, although equally impressive. The women won an event at the Head of Tennessee Regatta, while the novice crews per­formed well against the University of Michigan. Next weekend the novice crew will travel to Philadelphia for a 1500-meter regatta. 
"We have a great deal of talent coming up through the novice, espe­cially the freshmen," Younger said. "They will get a chance at Philadel­phia to see their competition for the future." 
In the spring, the entire club will travel to Texas over break to train for the new season. There, it also will compete at the Head of Texas Regatta before returning to Notre Dame for its first home regatta on St. Joe River. 
To raise money for such ventures and to pay for the incredibly expen­sive "shells" and boathouses, the rowing club sponsors many fundraisers throughout the year. This weekend the club is sponsoring an "Ergothon," where team mem­bers will work in half-hour shifts for fifty hours on the Ergometer, a spe­cial, simulated rowing machine.
