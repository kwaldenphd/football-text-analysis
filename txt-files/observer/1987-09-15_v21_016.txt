A man who stole a 1977 Na­tional Championship plaque and 1979 Cotton Bowl football from the ACC was ap­prehended Wednesday when he accidently ran into the South Bend Police SWAT team prac­ticing nearby, said Assistant Director of Security Phil Johnson. 
At about 2:45 p.m. Wednes­day a man, who Security will on two counts of first-degree murder and one count of first­degree criminal sexual con­duct, or rape, Sullivan said. 

Root was ordered held with­out bond in the Oakland County Jail pending preliminary ex­amination Sept. 21 before Dis­trict Judge Douglas Voss, Sul­livan said. 
Conviction on first-degree murder is punishable by man­datory life imprisonment with­out parole; conviction on the sex charge is punishable by up to life imprisonment, the chief said.

The suspect, who is not a Notre Dame student, was later spotted by Security east of campus near U.S. · 23, said Johnson. 
Additional Security officers were then called to search for the suspect, who fled into a nearby wooded area, he said. 
The South Bend Police SWAT 

Police from three agencies arrested Root and a female companion Sunday afternoon in rural Mecosta County, five days after Edward and Marion Beauchamp were found stran­gled in their bed following a break-in. 
Edward Beauchamp, 75, and Marion Beauchamp, 74, were the parents of Father Beau­champ, second in command be­hind University President Fa­ther Edward Malloy. Services for the couple were held Friday.

The plaque and football were recovered, he added. 
The suspect, who was taken to the St. Joseph County Jail, will be charged with theft, pro­viding false information about his identity and age and resist­ing arrest, said Johnson. 
Security took the plaque and football into its posession as evidence, he added. 


Pope visits sick; raps abortion 
Associated Press 
PHOENIX, Ariz. -Pope John Paul II held a tiny premature baby in his arms Monday, then denounced the "great evil of abortion and euthanasia" and repeated his condemnation of any form of test-tube fertiliza­tion. 
He also reserved time during his one-day stop in this South­western state for a talk with the original owners -American Indians. 
The meeting with the Indians was the first of its kind -a gat­hering of 16,000 from 195 tribes and officials of dioceses that minister to them. 
There are 285,000 Indians among the nation's 52.9 million Catholics. 
The pontiff's first stop after arriving from San Antonio, Texas, was at St. Joseph's Hospital, where he visited three children in their rooms and stopped in a playroom to see ten others. 
"Johnny, can you wake up and open your eyes for a min­ute? There's someone here to see you," said Hope Adrian, whose 15-year-old son, Johnny, was in the first room to be visited by the pope. There was no response from the boy, who has been diagnosed as having an inoperable brain tumor. 
of Miami, had been staying at a Detroit motel about a mile from the Beauchamps' home while working at the state fair, Sullivan said. Police were trying Monday to determine which company employed the pair, the chief said. 
Root and Lopez were ar­rested without incident at the cabin southeast of Mecosta in the westcentral Lower Penin­sula. 
Police also recovered a car allegedly stolen from the Beauchamps after they were slain. But Sullivan said Root 

New equipment to rid area of ethanol smell 
By CARl MARTINEZ

Ethanol. The familiar odor of ethanol around Notre Dame will soon subside, said Nathan Kimpel, general manager at the local ethanol plant. 
The New Energy Com­pany of Indiana is in the process of installing odor abatement equipment which will be in operation by the end of October. 
Kimpel said the equip­ment is like "no other sys­tem that we have seen anywhere" and will cost less than $400,000. 
Although the system will not eliminate all of the odor, probable elimination es-

probably would not face charges stemming from either the break-in or car theft be­cause of the life sentences man­dated by a first-degree murder conviction. 
Lopez was arraigned Mon­day in 77th District Court in Big Rapids on two counts of passing bad checks, court clerk Evelyn Hampel said. Magistrate Gary Lough set bond at $50,000 and scheduled a preliminary ex­amination for Sept. 23, she said.

In the second room, the pope took 2 month-old Brooke Johnson from her mother and held her briefly. Brooke weighed one pound, 5 ounces when she was born three months premature on June 29 and, according to her mother, Debby Johnson, now weighs 2 pounds, 10 ounces. 
When the pope inquired about the child's health, her mother responded, "She's doing very well. She's healthy." 
Issie "Lottie" Velasquez was the third child visited by the pope. She has been hospitalized since April when she was paralyzed from the neck down as the result of a traffic acci­dent. 
In the playroom, John Paul picked up a drawing by one child, examined it briefly, ex­claiming, "Oh, she's an artist. Yes, yes, she's an artist," then handed it to Phoenix Bishop Thomas J. O'Brien, who was at his side. He chatted with the other children and staff and ac­cepted a bouquet from a small child. 
Outside the hospital, he con­gratulated employees on their "beautiful work," calling it an "evangelical mission to heal the suffering and the sick. We

In romance at college, 'Nice Guys' finish last 
"Thank you for the flowers," she called on Friday to say. "Ohhh, Mark. You're such a Goober." 
The woman of my dreams wasn't calling me a chocolate-covered peanut. Nor was she refer­ring to me as a character on the old "Andy Griffith Show." 
No, it was much worse than that. She was referring to me as a "Nice Guy." 
I knew my chances for her were over. As all Nice Guys know, when it comes to love and romance in college, Nice Guys finish last. 
There are exceptions, of course. But for the most part, college women don't want Nice Guys. 
Just who is a Nice Guy? It's not hard to tell. 
A Nice Guy doesn't get drunk on the weekends, dance on the pooltables at Bridgett's and throw up. No, a Nice Guy stays sober and drives the pooltable dancers home -with the women they picked up. 
Around Christmas time, a Nice Guy takes a woman shopping. She has him try on men's sweaters to see how they look. The sweaters aren't for him, though. They're for another guy --the guy she loves. 
A Nice Guy is a good listener, and he's un­derstanding. He'll sometimes talk to a woman until2 a.m. about her problems. 
Unfortunately for the Nice Guy, her problems usually have to do with another guy --the guy she loves. 
A Nice Guy makes a good brother. 
A Nice Guy has a woman pass out in his arms. He doesn't take advantage of her. He doesn't even consider it. 
A Nice Guy is "good friends" with a lot of women, as in "Oh, him? We're just good friends." 
A Nice Guy is the "old reliable" SYR date. If all else fails, a woman can always call a Nice Guy. She won't have the best time. But at least the Nice Guy is available. And he won't bite. 
A Nice Guy, in fact, is always around to do a favor. He'll carry a refrigerator, provide a ride to the mall, or pick up someone from the airport. He will never say no. He'll feel too guilty. 
A Nice Guy, in other words, resembles Charlie Brown. He's pleasant, agreeable, and selfless. And he's unsuccessful with the little red-haired girl. 

Mark Pankowski 
Managing Eciitor

So why aren't Nice Guys successful with wo­men in college? 
Perhaps it's because college is supposed to be fun and exciting, so women want fun and exciting men. Nice Guys aren't as exciting as. pooltable dancers. 
Or perhaps Nice Guys don't chase after Nice Girls, who probably have similar complaints about romance in college as Nice Guys. 
Or perhaps, as a Sept. 4 Chicago Tribune ar­ticle said, "being a Nice Guy brings one close to falling over the edge into wimpdom. Nice is safe. Nice is aimless, formless. 
"If Nice Guys were food on the table of life, they'd be soft, crunchless and malleable. 
"Today, when the question is asked, 'What's so nice about being a Nice Guy?' the answer is, 'Not much."' 
So is there hope for Nice Guys? 
Fortunately, there is. Word has it that after college, Nice Guys do pretty well in the romance department. In fact, Nice Guys are in demand. 
For now, however, most collegiate Nice Guys will have to remain pleasant, understanding, selfless --and alone. 
Given the choice, I'd rather be a chocolate­covered peanut.

"The Church encourages genuine advances in knowl­edge," he said, "but she also insists on the sacredness of human life at every stage and in every condition. The cause she serves is the cause of human life and human dig­nity." 
The pope called on health care workers to show "the love and compassion of Christ and his church" in treating patients with AIDS. 
"As you courageously affirm and implement your moral ob­ligation and social responsibil­ity to help those who suffer, you are, individually and collec­tively, living out the parable of the Good Samaritan," he added.

'Franglais' gets into French dictionary via Wall Street 
There are usually about 100 new entries, including names, words, expressions and meanings. This year's 77,000 entries include 129 new contri­butions, Ouvrard said. 
"The difficulty is in trying not to make mistakes, taking only words that are in style now," she said. "We try not to take words that are too a la mode," because they will soon disappear. 
Many new words this year are of a technical nature. 
Among them: "seropositif," or seropositive, most com­monly used to denote a positive test for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and "procreatique," referring to the study of artifical procrea­tion. 
"Raider" and "finaliser" (to make final) are among this year's new English words or derivatives. They join such standards as "OK" and "weekend." 
Among the words rejected was the American term "zap­ping," to describe switching from TV channel to channel, es­pecially during commercials. 
"IGF," the French tax on large fortunes that was done away with after the conserva­tives came to power last year, is gone from this year's Petit Larousse, joining "scoubidou" in the trash heap of outmoded verbiage. 
Each year, an editorial com­mittee studies lists of potential new words offered by about 20 people who are assigned to fol­low various sectors of society.

PARIS-Straight from Wall Street, "raider" has elbowed its way into the 1988 edition of Petit Larousse, a French dic­tionary that acts as a mirror of contemporary life and lan­guage. 
No arbiter of perfect French, Petit Larousse documents the rise and fall of personalities and words. Less weighty than the more staid Petit Robert die, tionary, it is perused for the peculiarities of the past year. 
The just-published edition in­cludes 73 new words, 20 new meanings to words, nine new expressions and 27 new proper nouns, including Philippine President Corazon Aquino, ten­nis star Ivan Lendl, and Cher­nobyl, site of the world's worst commercial nuclear accident. 
Some have compared the ar­rival of the Petit Larousse to the annual uncorking of the nouveau Beaujolais. 
But language purists might consider Petit Larousse "ralant," a homegrown word meaning bothersome and a new entry in this year's edition,

Concern for students key to policy 
I am writing in response to your Sep­tember 10 article regarding the drunk driving policy approved by the Office of Student Affairs. As the only student member of the committee who did not graduate last year, I wanted to clarify the questions you raised regarding the effectiveness of the policy. I would like to emphasize at the beginning that I am speaking of my own opinion and that my views are not necessarily those of the committee or of the administration. 

David Kinkopf 
guest column 
I am very proud of this policy, not only in its final results, but also in the stated purpose of the ad hoc committee and in the method the committee used in formulating the policy. The problems which The Observer sees in the policy are understandable and well thought out. However, these problems arise from a lack of understanding regarding the purpose of the committee and a cynicism regarding its method. The Ob­server's main point, I believe, is that the committee is at fault for only recommending sanctions which will go to into effect after a DUI offense, which does nothing to solve the problem. The Observer ends its editorial by condemn­ing the policy, saying: "In essence the University's policy deals with drunk driving after it occurs, rather than dealing with the problem when it should -before it occurs." The Observer is ab­solutely correct in this observation. The · issue of drunk driving must be dealt with, whenever and however possible, before it occurs. However, it would be incorrect to maintain that the Univer­sity should not have a policy directing the administration when cases of DUI do in fact occur; for, as The Observer itself states: "Despite last year's tragedies, students continue to drink and drive." Therefore, one must under­stand the purpose of the policy and take it for what it is. It is not an end all to the University's drinking, or even its drinking and driving, problems. The stated purpose of the committee was "to recommend a policy, including sanctions, to be implememted in cases of DUI involving Notre Dame stu­dents." Plain and simple. Our charge was to give the administration guidelines to act consistently, fairly 
Doonesbu 

and correctly with students involved in DUI incidents. This is because, as the committee report states: "the absence of a policy to guide University officials in these situations risked arbitrary and ad hoc decision-making which in the long run could ill-serve both the Notre Dame community and the students for whom those decisions would be made." We were not, as The Observer editorial falsely claims: "formed to discourage students from driving under the influ­ence of alcohol." 
I hope this clears up two of The Ob­server's three reasons for the "failure" of the policy: that "the committee's recommended action is presented in a negative way," and that "the commit­tee has failed to offer positive ways to prevent students from drinking and driving." This is certainly not meant to excuse the University from its re­sponsibility to attempt to prevent DUI incidents. And although education for the responsible use of alcohol was beyond the policy-making scope of the committee, the committee makes itself quite clear. ''A consensus, however, did arise that the University has not imple­mented fully the recommendations con­tained in the report, ('the alcohol policy'), especially those dealing with education." Here, as an interested and fairly-informed student, I must con­demn the administration's failure to in­itiate and ensure effective educational programs on the responsible use of al­cohol. The administration has spent a disproportionate amount of effort and resources in monitoring student com­pliance to the alcohol policy while failing to live up to its own end of the policy, which includes establishing an office on alcohol education. 
The Observer's third objection allows me to discuss the policy itself briefly. The Observer claims: "the sanctions that imposed against a student for drinking and driving 'off campus' are a form of double jeopardy." I must ad­mit that while on the committee, I learned a lot about the administration's vision of "community." The adminis­tration's commitment to the realization of a better community is very serious indeed and includes protecting its members from others and from them­selves, as well as forming statements on important issues to those outside our community. The Observer, and many students, I think, believe "the Univer­sity should only punish students for 
drinking and driving on campus." The University, rightly, feels concern for the members of its community, wher­ever they are. Whether he is on or off campus, the drunk driver risks death, injury or arrest to himself, and death or injury to others : passengers and pedestrians, students and South Bend residents. Whether on or off campus, the Notre Dame student or employee and the South Bend resident has the right to be protected from a drunk driver. The punishments outlined in the policy, especially for first offenders are very, very minor, and, for the most part, punishment is left to the proper criminal authorities. The sanctions ex­ist to ensure that the student receives adequate attention from the Univer­sity, that the student realizes the gravity of his offense, that the Notre Dame community stands up for its commitment to the responsible use of alcohol and respect for others and, as stated before, to give a clear outline of procedure to follow by the administra­tion. But maybe the strongest argu­ment for punishing off campus of­fenders is that Notre Dame is a part of the larger South Bend community. We, as students, are guests here. We do not share the concerns that permanent residents of South Bend, including non­student members of the Notre Dame community, have for their city and its residents. When we do damage to the South Bend community by drinking and driving, it is necessary for the Notre Dame administration to respond in an appropriate way. Notre Dame, as an institution and permanent part of the South Bend community, cannot leave the problem of Notre Dame drunk drivers solely to the authorities of South Bend, but rather must work together 
in an effort to stop this problem. 
I was frankly offended by The Obser­ver's claim that "counseling becomes a way to punish students rather than a way to help them." The committee states explicitly: "in addition to any sanctions recommended in this policy, the committee unanimously urges the Notre Dame community to respond with all its resources to provide espe­cial pastoral care and support..." I learned a great deal about the admin­istration's concern for each student; al­though we do not always see it, this University cares. 
One final point, if I may. The Obser­ver uses the term "administration's so­lution." This is not true. There were only two administrators on the commit­tee compared to four students, giving the students the largest representation on the committee. Also, by far, the larg­est number of people interviewed were students and Hall Staff members. If anything, this is the "student's solu­tion." So I must commend the univer­sity for its bold and very productive decision to be as representative as pos­sible in making this policy. The com­mittee and, I hope, the entire adminis­tration see "the many benefits which accrue from collaborative efforts in­volving all our constituents ... " 
In conclusion, my primary purpose in writing this is to clarify some mis­givings regarding the policy. At the same time, this is a challenge to the administration to continue its fruitful use of students in policy formation and to fulfill its promises in the alcohol policy concerning alcohol education. It is also a challenge to the students and The Observer editorial staff to read the entire policy, especially the introduc­tory letter by the committee. Only then can you come to an intelligent conclu­sion about the policy and know your rights and responsibilities.

Notre Dame will have two chances this week to gain its first victory. The Irish will visit Hope Col­lege on Thursday and host Indiana University at home on Sunday. 
The Sailing Club encountered the problems one might expect when a team has the dual responsi­bility of running a regatta and competing in it. 
Notre Dame organized a regatta last weekend at the Diamond Lake Yacht Club in Michigan. The Irish ran the competition successfully, but did not do as well in the regatta competition as they had hoped. Notre Dame placed eighth out of 15 teams. 
The club is now preparing to compete in a regatta hosted by the University of Iowa this weekend. 
"We'll probably do a little better this weekend because of the competition," said Club President Mark Ryan. "It was just a little hard running the regatta and sailing it. There was a lot of confusion."

U.S. Open final 
Lendl wins third straight title 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK-Ivan Lendl won his third straight U.S. Open title Monday, rallying after losing his first set of the tourn­ament to beat Mats Wilander in a lengthy baseline battle. 
Lendl, weakened by the flu, downed the 23-year-old Swede 6-7 (7-9), 6-0, 7-6 (7-4), 6-4 in a '4-hour, 47-minute match at the National Tennis Center. 
Lendl thrust his fists upward in joy and covered his face with his hands after closing out the match with a backhand service return down the line. Both players had held serve in the final set until the lOth game. 
Lendl, who has also won three French Open titles, said his illness drained him during the match. 
"I was out of juice for the last 3 ll.l sets ," he said. "It was strength of mind and a little bit of luck. In this kind of match, there's such little difference between the players." 
Lendl, 27, and John McEnroe are the only men to win three 
buttons and it does the counting for you. 
It makes multiple copies. 

From time to time you want a copy of 
what you've typed, right? Well, if you use a Videowriter you won't have to go to the school library to look 
for a copier machine. All you'll have to look for is the 
button marked "print." Press it and the Videowriter will make another original. 
And because your work is auto­matically stored on a standard 3 Yz" floppy disk, you can make those copies whenever you want. It obviously does a lot more than type. 
That's because the word pro­cessing features just go on and on. 
What's more. we sell the Videowriter" Word Processor for around the price of a good electronic typewriter. 
And that's quite a bargain when you consider the amount of time it'll save you. Time you can spend doing the work for your other classes. 
You would do that, wouldn't you?

"It's something I never dreamt of," Lendl said. "It's unbelievable. If somebody told me three years ago, when I had lost my third straight final, I wouldn't have believed it. I would have said that person was crazy." 
Wilander, who has won two French and two Australian Open titles, was in his first U.S. Open final. 
"I was surprised to be in the final," he said. "But after the way I played in the tourna­ment, I thought I could win it." 
It was Lendl's second victory over Wilander this year in a Grand Slam final, with the first coming on the slow red clay at the French Open. The U.S. Open is played on hardcourts, a faster surface. 
Wilander, a classic baseliner, said he tried to be aggressive against Lendl, who has a more varied attack. 
"I was the one who was at­tacking," Wilander said. "But you can't do it all the time. I can't attack any more for my

The match, postponed Sun­day because of rain, started un­der sunny skies at 2: 11 p.m. EDT. when it ended at 6:58 p.m., the sun had set and the stadium lights were on. 
Wilander, who was more emotional than usual during the match, won the first-set tie­breaker after saving one set point with a forehand passing shot. 
The set, which lasted 1 ll.l hours, ended when Lendl hit a forehand that landed inches wide of the sideline. Lendl argued briefly with chair um­pire Richard Kaufman, who declined to overrule the line of­ficial's call. 
That broke Lendl's 25-set winning streak at the Open. He hadn't lost a set at the Open since losing the third set in his quarterfinal victory over Henri Leconte last year.

Belles tennis takes first four 
By ANNE GALLAGHER Sports Writer 
The predictions of Saint Mary's tennis coach Debra Laverie came true as the team emerged from its first four con­tests undefeated. 
"We went in expecting to win," said Laverie. 
The Belles began the season Sept. 8 by shutting out Val­paraiso University, 9-0. Number-one spotholder Jen­nifer Block showed resiliance when she came back to win her match. After losing a close first set, 6-7, to Heidi Bussewitz, she handled the Crusader op­ponent, 6-2, 6-0. 
Other singles victories in­cluded Sarah Mayer, Charlene Szajko, Elizabeth Heinz, Mary Turk and Jane Schnell. 
Two days later the squad travelled to Chicago where it defeated NCAA power DePaul University, 6-3. 
"We played on a clay surface here which is unusual to find now," said Laverie. "It really slows down the game." 
The clay surface seemed to agree with freshman Sarah Mayer who won straight sets, 6-3, 7-5. Szajko and Schnell also helped the Belles' cause as they each lost their first sets but came back to win their respec­tive matches. 

In doubles play, Block and Heinz teamed up to win, 6-3, 6-4, as did Schnell and Turk, 6-3, 6-3. 
The victory against Hillsdale College was sweet but not short. Halfway through play, heavy rain forced the teams to finish the match at the Jackson

Baltimore shortstop Cal Rip-Raquetball Club, 45 minutes away. 

Once again the doubles team of Block and Heinz won, 6-1, 6-4. Mayer and Szajko pulled out of a close first set, 7-6 and went on to win their second set, 6-4, as well as the match. 
In singles competition five of the six Saint Mary's players won in straight sets. 
"All the singles players were ~tt ...._ ~

said Laverie. 
The Belles hosted the Univer­sity of Wisconsin-Milwaukee on Sept. 13. The team ended this series of four games almost as strong as they began by taming the Panthers, 8-1. 
"This was a really good yardstick to measure our im­provement by," said Laverie. 
Last year the Belles defeated Wisconsin-Milwaukee, 5-4. 
Baseball had never before kept records of consecutive in­nings played, but it is generally believed by historians of the game that Ripken's streak is the longest ever by a player.

Volleyball improves, but settles for third 
with 15 kills and five service aces, while junior Maureen Shea hit home 13 kills and had 5 blocks in another solid all­around performance. 
"I thought we played very 

well against USC," said Notre 
Dame head coach Art Lam­
bert, "but once again critical 
errors at critical times really 
hurt us and cost us a chance to 
win that match. 
"We've proved that we can play with some of the top teams in the nation. Now we have to . go out and beat some of them." 
The Irish improved their 

record to 4-2 on Sunday with a 
15-7, 9-15, 21-19, 15-8 victory 
over Illinois State. 
After splitting the first two 

games, the two teams battled 
in the highest scoring game in 
Notre Dame history. The Irish 
pulled out the 21-19 victory to 
take a 2-1 advantage before 
clinching the match with a con­
vincing 15-8 win in the fourth 
game.

ND men's harriers whip Hoyas

Just one Georgetown runner kept the Notre Dame men's cross country team from recording a perfect score in its opening-meet victory Satur­day. 
The Irish occupied five of the top six positions in the dual meet at Washington D.C., with a lone Hoya finishing third. The strong showing propelled Notre Dame to an 18-41 win over the defending Big East champions to start the new season. 
"Georgetown was supposed to be a good test for us early in the season," said Irish coach Joe Piane, now in his 13th season at the helm. "We were ready for that test, and came through in fine form." 
Leading the way for Notre Dame were sophomore Mike O'Connor (26:08) and junior Ron Markezich 126: 18), finish­ing first and second, respec­tively. 
"I have said since last spring that those two (O'Connor and Markezich) could finish at or near the top in each race, and they did just that," Piane said. 
Another Irish star was senior Mike Smoron who finished fifth with a time of 26:49. Smoron was injured all of last year, and began light training only five months ago. 
"Mike worked extremely hard over the summer and deserves to be where he is.'' Piane said. "He runs with a lot of heart and is a real competi­tor -a· nice surprise.'· 
The Irish look to be one of the favorites in the upcoming Na­tional Catholic Invitational. Senior captain Dan Garrett, who finished sixth with a time of 26:59 on Saturday, will be a key to future success according to Piane.

The Notre Dame volleyball team turned in an impressive performance over the weekend at the Mid-America Classic, winning one match and losing another. 
Itwas the second consecutive third-place tournament finish for the Irish in as many weekends. 
On Saturday, Notre Dame stayed close to 12th-ranked Southern Cal but could not pull out the victory, losing 10-15, 12­15, 15-13, and 7-15 in the first round of the tournament. 
The Irish battled the Trojans for over two hours and outhit them in kill percentage, .225 to .185. Despite losing the first two games and being down 13-8 in the potential match-clinching game for Southern Cal, Notre Dame battled back and scored the final seven points to force a fourth game. 
Junior Zanette Bennett, who was named to the all­tournament team, led the Irish 
By TIM SULLIVAN Sports Writer 
For three· weeks the Notre Dame women's cross-country team has trained hard, almost too hard. 
On Saturday, the team's hard work finally paid off as the Irish virtually mastered the challenging course at the Detroit Invitational and ran away with their first champi­onship of the season. 
Led by junior Theresa Rice, the Irish placed seven runners in the top 10 for 25 points, edging out Detroit (35), Mal­comb Junior College (82) and four other teams. 
Rice took the lead in the race early and never looked back. Her time of 18:49.1 set a new meet record, and was nearly 40 seconds better than the second­place finisher. 
In Notre Dame's first meet last weekend, Rice placed second on the team to fellow junior Terry Kibelstis, but in just one week Rice improved her time by 20 seconds over the 5,000-meter course. 
"This course was much more challenging and interesting," said Rice. "We all went into this meet very confident." 
But Rice was by no means Head Coach Dan Ryan's only weapon. 
Kibelstis placed third 
(19:35.9) and freshman Jen Ledrick (20:04.3) led a group of five Irish runners who finished within seven seconds of each other. 
Ryan attributed his team's success to its demanding train­ing schedule. 
"This meet marked the end of our three-week 'real hard crunch,'" said Ryan. "We had three weeks of very hard prac­tice. They looked very tired, but also very strong and confi­dent." "When you practice that hard, it makes you tired for the first couple meets," Rice added. "But we knew that we had worked harder (than the other teams)." 
The Titans of Detroit finished close to the Irish and, in fact, were leading early in the race. At one point, in the first mile, five Detroit runners occupied the second through sixth places behind Rice. 

The Irish, however, remained confident. 
"We ran against them last year," said Kibelstis, "and we knew that they like to push out hard and take control of meets. We sat back (in the first mile), and in the second mile we came alive and controlled the meet.'' 
There were two key Irish sta­tistics in Ryan's mind. The first was 'the differential' -the time difference between Notre Dame's first and fifth place

Male presence alters SMC flag football 
Football at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's is a popular pastime, whether it's playing for Notre Dame's varsity team, a Notre Dame's men's dorm, a Notre Dame flag football team or a Saint Mary's flag-football team. 
When I arrived on the Saint Mary's campus in the fall of 1985, I was thrilled that I could finally play on a real football team. In the past the closest I came to playing football was being tossed around by my brothers. I was eager to meet new people as well as learn the finer techniques of flag-football, so I quickly joined my hall's flag-football team. 
Playing on the flag-football team more than met my expectations. I appreciated the fact that none of the girls who joined the team were cut. After some intense practices I captured the position of center, and I have played in that spot my entire football career. Three to four times a week our
I team would head for the field in front of our dorm to acquaint ourselves with the plays and the mem­bers of the team. 
The season opened and the teams nervously ap­proached each other, but once the game was un­derway we relaxed and had a great time. We struggled through the season with our share of mis­takes and injuries. I, myself, fumbled a few snaps, but no one took it too seriously. All the teams seemed to enjoy playing despite the weather and occasional bad calls. The entire dorm enjoyed sup­porting the team and the hall spirit as well as the hall rivialries grew. 
The exact number of wins and loses we had seems to escape me, but I do remember suiting up for the championship game. Unfortunately my team was not victorious, yet it had been a good season, so no

one was disappointed. All the halls gained respect for each other and had fun doing it. Besides playing football there were team socials and lasting friendships to be enjoyed. The next season many old faces returned in addition to a new group of players. It was a similiarly enjoyable season and rny team again managed to lose the championship. 
As another flag-football season begins, the old team will not be regrouping. This fall the Saint Mary's flag-football teams are going co-ed. Now I have nothing against mixed-gender sports, but the teams will lose the hall spirit and comradery. Since I did not play on any of the other Saint Mary's teams, I loved the excitement of playing a team sport that did not require an overabundance of ath­letic skill. 
For many players the co-ed teams will be in­timidating because some of the male ball-hogs might control the games. The co-ed teams will bring a different kind of flag-football to Saint Mary's . I am certain it will be fun and everyone will be able to play on the team that they want, but after playing for two years on the all-girl team I am going to miss the old version. 
The Saint Mary's flag-football teams were changed to co-ed because the interest in the teams seemed to decline by the end of the season. The Saint Mary's co-ed volleyball teams are one of the most popular activities, so naturally a co-ed flag­football team should generate the same sort of par­ticipation. The co-ed teams will be exciting and playing football is great whether one plays with girls, or guys, in the snow. 
If there are any women interested in playing on all-girl teams, then they should try to organize some teams. The all-girl teams could then play against one another and the co-ed teams could do the same. 
Football is all around the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's communities. Many ·people will probablly go to the Notre Dame varsity football game this Saturday. So if you enjoy the game as I do go outside and play with whoever you can round up.
