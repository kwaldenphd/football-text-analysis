Events honor Martin Luther King Day 
With classes in session, letter-writing campaign, prayer service remember leader's legacy 
By LIZ HARTER Assistanr News Editor 
The legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr. is nationally recognized once a year with many employ­ers canceling work and televi­sion stations broadcasting King's famous "I have a dream" speech. Today, classes at Notre Dame continue, but activities through­out the week will celebrate the activist's life 40 years after his assassination. 
While there have been Martin Luther King, Jr. Day activities in the past, events are more visible on campus this year. 
"I don't think that there are more or less events this year for Martin Luther King, Jr. Day," said Lai-nin Wan, chair of the Student Senate Multicultural Affairs Committee. "I think they're simply just a lot better advertised." 
Wan said her committee is actively working to advertise the events they planned for today. The committee chose community service as a way to do something for the South Bend community in the name of King, Wan said. 
"[KingJ in many ways symbol­ized togetherness and empha­sized the importance of growing together as a community," she said. 
Events range from a letter writing campaign for the troops overseas through the A Million Thanks organization and termi­nally ill children through the Make a Child Smile organization to setting up Valentine's Day dec­orations and playing Bingo with residents at the Healthwin Specialized Care Center in down­town South Bend. 
The community centers that will be receiving aid from stu­dents are those that expressed an interest in working with the committee. 
"This is the first year we're going to have this day of service, but it has been received really well, so I'm hoping that the chair next year will carry on this new tradition," Wan said. 
There will also be an all-cam­pus prayer service in the rotun­da of the Main Building at 12:30 p.rrr. at which University President Father John Jenkins and Hugh Page, dean of the University First Year of Studies, will offer prayers and reflections on the life of King. 
"The prayer service is some­thing we've brought back," Wan said. "This is something we used to do back in the 90s, but haven't

Cardinal cotntnetnorates first Moreau feast 
Former Washington, D.C. archbishop headlines conference on Holy Cross Congregation founder 
By JOHN TIERNEY News Writer 
Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, former archbish­op of Washington, D.C., headlined Saturday's confer­ence "A Great Cloud of Witnesses: Saints in the Catholic Tradition" with a glowing speech on the life of Father Basil Moreau, founder of the Congregation of the Holy Cross. 
The conference was held in honor of the first celebration of Moreau's feast day Sunday. 
Moreau is a man that the cardinal "would have loved to have known," McCarrick said. "He has become a friend of mine. I hope that you too will become a friend of Basil." 

McCarrick described 
Moreau as "a very extraordi­
nary man and a great man 
for our times." He credited 
Moreau with helping to save 
the church in France follow­
ing the anti-establishment 
movements of the French 
Revolution. 
Moreau's life from 1799­
1873 should be viewed in 
context of the turmoil that 
then enveloped his native 
France, McCarrick said. 
"France was a very inter­esting and confusing place," McCarrick said. The revolu­tionaries "wanted to get rid .of the Church and its power so that it could never come 
back." 
Despite the anti-Church 
movements of the early 19th 
century, Moreau's family

Student assaulted on Bulla 
Undergrad reported attacker hit, kicked her 
By KAREN LANGLEY 
News Editor 
An undergraduate student reported being assaulted Thursday evening in a parking lot at Fischer Graduate Residences along Bulla Road, Notre Dame Security/Police said. 
The student told NDSP she was struck in the face and then kicked by a man who approached her after walking behind her, NDSP Director Phillip Johnson said in a campus-wide e-mail Thursday night. The man asked the woman questions before grabbing her arm and hitting her in the face, he said. When she then fell to the ground, the man kicked her, she told NDSP. 
Johnson had "no information to share about" the nature of those questions, he said Sunday. He did not know if the woman sought medical attention, he said. 
The man then fled in a vehicle, possibly accompanied by two other people, NDSP said. The sus­pect in the assault was described to NDSP as a 5-foot-10 to 6-foot­tall black male of stocky build. He appeared to be between 20 and 25 years of age and was wearing a black Puma jacket, NDSP said. 
Nothing was stolen from the woman, and no reason for the assault has surfaced, Johnson said. 
"It's not clear what the motive was," he said. The incident is considered an

SMC hosts weeklong 
heritage celebration 
By KATIE KOHLER Sainr Mary's Editor 
Students, faculty and staff will commemorate the College's heritage through a week-long series of movies, speeches and a closing dinner on Friday. 
The College's third Heritage Week kicked off Sunday with a Beatification Mass at the Church of Loretto. 
"Heritage Week is one of the most salient events hosted by [Board of Governance] because it continues the tradi­tions of the college as well as communicates the history to the student body," Hodges said. "In an effort to keep the spirit of who we are alive, the knowledge of who we are now and who we have been must be linked." 
Student Body president Kim Hodges, along with the rest of BOG, has changed the events for the week to encourage more student participation, she said. Rather than the book signing and speakers included in last year's week, this week's celebrations will include a dance performance and ice cream social. 
The Heritage Dinner at the end of the week and a few minor events, however, remain unchanged. 
"The entire week should be jam packed," she said. "We are optimistic that there will

Culture shock 
Whnn I got ofl' of the airplane tired and hungry during one of several lay­overs I had on the trek back from my snmostnr in Home, I suddenly knew that I was in America with the first two din­ing options I saw: Domino's Emma Driscoll Pizza and TCBY (The Country's Best Yogurt). A<> News Wzre Editor I stood there, looking back and forth between the two, alii could think was that Dominos was fake pizza and that the best this country had to ofl'er was noth­ing like Old Bridge gelato. This experi­ence was only the beginning of culture shock. 
And things got even more shocking last week, my first back at Notre Dame since May. 
The computer cluster on the second floor of the library seems to have disap­peared. I keep forgetting to enter my net ID and password to print at the dustors, and then I end up thinking that the printers aro broken. Construction blocks my normal route to DeBartolo. A new dorm is being built. I can never dodde if acquaintances will remembor me from last spring. People look youngor. Thn dining halls have Coke Znro -but no Coca-Cola light-and apple slices. The CSC is right by my dorm. Campus snoms like a small world bncause nveryone's paths seem to bn (TOSSing. 
I rnalizn that norHl of this is now to the majority of students, but that just makes thoso changes weirder. While I was in Homo, Notre Dame continued on as usual -and in some ways, it even improved. lnnvnr expected anything difl'ornnt, but this was humbling all the samo. 
Fortunately, I was relieved to find that somll of my fhvoritn things about cam­pus havn not changed at all. The dining hall still makP.s s'mores. The candles in the Grotto arc still lit. The Starbucks in I .aFortune is still great. The lions still guard Pangborn. ()'Shag still has char­actor. God Quad is still just so pretty. Thll Obsorver still prints horoscopes. 
Them arn a lot of things that I miss about Home. I loved the independence of walking around the Eternal City­whether or not I knew where I was going. I loved the city at night. I loved fileling so insignifkant-but also so incrndibly blessP.d-standing in Sa)nt Peter's Square. I loved the automated announcemP.nl<> on the Metro and the fad that it does not take you to major parts of the city. I loved dodging ping­pong balls in the erroneously named Lemon Trne Courtyard with the other Notrn Dame kids. I loved the color, the architecture, the history, the food, the wino, the paee and how everything­f'rom trying to get glasses fixed to a haircut to an innocent misreading of military time -became an adventure and a story. 
Still, it is great to be baek at Notre Dame. Sf)oing the familiar Golden Dome over the trees as I was arriving just felt right. Junior yt~ar seems to be one of unexpected transitions and changes for overyone, but I am glad that the best of Notrn Dame has stayed pretty much the same -give or take a few apples.

Candidate photoshops picture in campaign mailing 
HOUSTON -A mailer from a congressional candi­date's campaign contains a photo of his head attached to an image of a different body that makes him look thinner. 
The photo is presented as a true image of Dean Hrbacek, a Republican for­mer mayor of Sugar Land. In reality, it is a computer­ized composite of Hrbaeek's face and someone else's slimmer figure, in suit and tie, from neck to knee. 
Hrbacek, a tax lawyer and accountant, did not immediately return a call to his campaign headquarters Friday by The Associated Press. He is seeking the nomination to run against Democratic U.S. Rep. Nick Lampson.

Catnpuses celebrate Moreau's first FeastDay 
By GENE NOONE 
News Writer 
Notre Dame and Saint Mary's celebrated the first Feast Day of Blessed Basil Moreau with Sunday Masses that honored the life and legacy of the Holy Cross founder. 
Sunday marked the 135th anniversary of Moreau's death and was the first time official prayers designated for his Feast Day were used in the Eucharistic Liturgy. 
Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, archbishop emeritus of Washington, D.C., presided at the 10 a.m. Mass at the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. McCarrick pre­viously presided over a Mass of Thanksgiving for Moreau's beati­fication last September in Le Mans, France. 
The Mass contained special prayers and readings as well as a brass ensemble that accompa­nied the Liturgical Choir. 
Father Peter Rocca, rector of the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, said the feast day is an opportu­nity for people to learn from Moreau's life. 
"Hopefully by celebrating his fea._<;t, people will come away with a much greater appreciation of this great man of faith, and learn something of the congregation of priests, brothers and sisters which he founded," he said. 
Junior Peter Privon, who attended the Mass, said he was impressed by Moreau's accom­plishments. 
"It was interesting to hear about the history of Father Moreau and his legacy at the Mass," he said. "I never knew what a large impact he had on so many people at such a young age." 
Saint Mary's celebrated an all­school Mass Sunday evening in the Church of Our Lady of Loretto. The Mass was led by campus minister, Father John Pearson. 
The Saint Mary's Women's Choir, the Liturgical Choir and the Hand Bell Choir sang for the Mass while the Liturgical Dancers interpreted the readings. 
The Mass launched Saint Mary's third annual Heritage Week, which celebrates more than 150 years of school history. Saint Mary's will celebrate its heritage throughout the week with a series of lectures and per­formances. 
Sister Rose Anne Schultz, vice president for mission, said that with Moreau's feast day and Heritage Week, she hopes each person associated with the College will grow in appreciation for the heritage that shapes the school's mission today. 
Moreau was beatified by Pope Benedict XVI on Sept. 15, 2007 in Le Mans, France. When the Pope beatified Moreau, he established Jan. 20 as his Liturgical Feast Day.

Boy confesses to role in Bhutto murder 
ISLAMABAD-A 15-year-old detained near the Afghan border has confessed to joining a team of assassins sent to kill Benazir Bhutto, officials said Saturday, announcing the first arrests in the case since the attack that killed the opposition leader. 
Police also announced they had foiled new suicide attacks against the country's Shiite minority. 
Interior Secretary Kamal Shah confirmed the arrest of two people in the town of Dera Ismail Khan in North West Frontier province, and said one -a teenage boy -had confessed involvement in the Dec. 27 attack that killed Bhutto. He said interrogators were trying to get corroborating testimony from the other detainee before accepting the confession. 
Communist Party dominates election 
HAVANA-Cubans ratified a slate of parlia­mentary candidates on Sunday including Fidel Castro, the ailing 81-year-old leader who has not been seen in public for nearly 18 months. 
Only one choice appeared for each post in districts across the country and there was no campaigning. The Communist Party is the only party allowed, but the government says membership is not a prerequisite for the par­liament that rubber stamps official party poli­cy. 
Still, Cubans lined before dawn to cast their ballots. Some 8.4 million voters were being asked to back 614 top Communists, career politicians, musicians and athletes for posts in the legislature, known as the National AssemBly.

Senior Patrol Agent Luis Aguilar was struck on Interstate 8 in the Imperial Sand Dunes Recreation Area about 20 miles west of Yuma on Saturday, said Agent Michael Bernacke, a spokesman for the agency's Yuma sector. 
Bernacke said Aguilar was trying to place spike strips in the path of two vehicles believed to have illegally entered the country from Mexico when one of the vehicles hit him.

There were no immediate arrests in either shooting, police said. 
The first shooting happened late Saturday at a Long Beach Masonic temple, where several gang members apparently crashed a birthday party and started a fight, police Sgt. Dina Zapalski said. 
A 17 -year-old boy and a 15-year-old girl died of gunshot wounds, Zapalski said. Another 17 -year­old boy sullered injuries that were not life-threat­ening. 
Hundreds of partygoers were taken by bus to a nearby elementary school, where police ques­tioned them. Zapalski said.

Baby found with alcohol in system 
MUNCIE -A woman and her fiancee face neglect charges as authorities say tests showed the woman's 11-month-old son had alcohol in his system after passing out. 
The boy's father noticed his son was not responsive when he picked him up for a visit on Wednesday, police Lt. AI Williams said. A blood draw taken at an Anderson hospital measured the boy's blood-alcohol content at 0.118 percent, which is higher than the state legal limit to drive of 0.08 percent. 
The boy's mother, 19-year-old Amanda Elbert, and her fiancee, Edward L. Williams, 29, were being held Sunday in the Delaware County Jail.

Fuel blockage causes blackout 
U.N. agencies, human rights groups condemn Israel after country cut power to Gaza City 
Associated Press 

GAZA CITY -Gaza City was plunged into darkness Sunday after Israel blocked the shipment of fuel that powers its only electrical plant in retaliation for per­sistent rocket attacks by Gaza militants. 
The power cut sent already beleaguered Gazans to stock up on food and bat­teries in anticipation of dark, cold days ahead. Gaza officials warned the move would cause a health catas­trophe while a U.N. agency and human rights groups condemned Israel. 
"We have the choice to either cut electricity on babies in the maternity ward or heart surgery patients or stop operating rooms," Gaza Health Ministry official Dr. Moaiya Hassanain said. 
Four hours after the blackout, Hamas claimed that five patients died because of the cutoff of elec­tricity in hospitals. The claim could not be con­firmed. 
Late Sunday, Israel car­ried out two airstrikes in Gaza City, Palestinian secu­rity officials said. The Israeli military confirmed both attacks in which a militant linked to Islamic Jihad was killed.

Oscars despite strike 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -Film fans finally will soon learn who's com­peting for this sea'ion 's Academy Awards. Now all we need to know is whether any nominees will turn up lbr the big show amid a writers strike that has thrown the awards season into tunnoil. 
The list of Oscar nominees Tuesday is expected to include sueh luminaries as Cate Blanchett, George Clooney, Daniel Day-Lewis and Angelina Jolie. 
That smattering of ta.lfmt alone would ensure that a lot of people at home would tune in to the Feb. 24 ceremony. But without the cooperation of the striking Writers Cuild of America, celebrities might honor tlw union's picket !inns and stay away from the Oscars, leaving the show's planners to either scrap the telecast or eome up with some now form of Oscar ceremony unlike anything audiences have seen befbrn. 
The word around llollywood is that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Seiences has a backup plan to put on the show without tl1e blessing of writers and stars, but they declined to disclose detaiL'>.

"We are planning to have our show on Feb. 24 at the Kodak Theatre with an audience of 3,300 people and a television audience significantly larger than that," said academy spokeswoman Leslie Unger. 
Next to the Super Bowl, the Oscars are the most-watched annual broadcast in the United States. Last year, 40.2 million Americans tuned in to the Oscars. 
The writers strike already took down Hollywood's second-biggest film honors, the Golden Globes. With the guild planning pickets outside and declining to let writers work on the show, stars fell in line and refused to attend.

leader Patrie Verrone has said the 
union also will not allow writers to 
work on the Oscars. 
Writers walked ofT the job Nov. 5 over their share of potential profits from programming on the Internet and other new media. Awards shows have become key ammuni­tion for the guild to try to bring producers back to the table after negotiations broke down Dec. 7. ·ntlks could reswne as early a'i this week. 
Yet the Academy Awards are a big step above the Golden Globes and other honors jeopardized by the writers strike, so some in Hollywood think the guild might relent and let the Oscars go on as planned if the strike lingers until then. 
"It would be in the writers' best interests to come to some kind of resolution, if only temporary, so the awards could go on," said Richard Zanuck, producer of Oscar best-picture winner "Driving Miss Daisy" and the recent Golden Globe winner for musical or come­dy, "Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street." 
"Canceling the Academy Awards is something almost too big to con­template. Any sympathy toward them in my estimation would evaporate." 
Potential Oscar nominees include "Sweeney Todd" stars Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, along with the film's direc­tor, Tim Burton. 
Among others in the running are Clooney for the legal drama "Miehael Clayton," Day-Lewis for the oil-boom epic 'There Will Be Blood," Jolie for the terrorism saga "A Mighty Heart" and Blanchett for the Bob Dylan tale ''I'm Not There" and possibly the historical pageant "Elizabeth: The Golden 
Age."

Moreau later sent members of his congregation on mis­sions to Algiers, Algeria and Vincennes, Ind. In exchange for receiving papal recogni­tion as a missionary congre­gation, Moreau also sent members to Bengal. 
Despite his congregation's success, Moreau became embedded in crisis when financial problems arose. When a fire at Notre Dame caused Father Edward Sorin to rebuild the campus with­out waiting for permission from Moreau coincided with a massive debt in the Paris operations, the pope blamed Moreau for the problems. However, when Moreau offered his resignation as superior general of his order in 1860, the pope refused the offer. 
Even before the financial problems arose, members of Moreau's order had begun a 
campaign to remove him because of his autocratic rul­ing style. This movement gained traction as the debts mounted, and the pope even­tually a(~cepted Moreau's res­ignation in 1866. Moreau was effectively forced out of his own congregation. 
Without his congregation. Moreau went to live at his blood sister's home and n1sumed his work as a mis­sionary auxiliary priest attempting to rn-evangelize France. 
McCarrick credits Moreau's vision for Holy Cross's suc­cess over the years. 
"Moreau was a founder, an apostle, a spiritual giant, a workaholic and a sometimes crank," he said. "But he had a vision that was so captivat­ing that hundreds and hun­dreds of men and women joined his congregation. lie had a vision of family, of car­ing and of total service."

Stock market falls as investors pull out 
NEW YORK -Wall Street ended a painful week with another decline Friday as skittish investors unable to hold on to much optimism about the economy drew little comfort from President Bush's stimulus plan. 
The day's trading reflected how fractious Wall Street has been in the new year. Investors pulled back from a big early advance, with the major indexes trading mixed as Bush began to speak. By the time the president fmished announcing a plan for about $145 billion worth of tax relief, the indexes were well into negative territory. 
"It's disappointed in the size of the economic growth package. Wall Street's showing its dis­pleasure," said Kim Caughey, equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. "Honestly, I think the institutional investors understand the limits to the government's ability to enact economic change." 
Steven Goldman, chief market strategist at Weeden & Co., contends Wall Street remains concerned about whether other economic trou­bles are lurking. 
"It's a culmination of factors that have been in existence for a while -it's the unknown," he .said. 
Leaders look to rescue economy 
Bush, House discuss growth package to prevent a recession as stock market declines 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -It didn't take long for President Bush to find a symbol for his desire to prime the sagging economy. 
At a factory in Frederick, Md., Bush eyed a huge, yel­low standup lawnmower and declared: "Crank this sucker up." 
Once the engine was roar­ing, he jumped aboard, grabbed the controls and playfully gave it a spin. 
Bush's cheerfullawnmow­er ride followed his much more sober remarks earlier Friday at the White House, where he called for up to $150 billion in tax relief for consumers and business to stave off the first national recession since 2001. 
With economic fears rising and the stock market tum­bling, Bush said there was no time to waste. 
His urgent remarks gave fresh impetus to congres­sional leaders already hard at work on an economic res­cue package that would include extra money for food stamps and jobless benefits in addition to tax rebates of hundreds of dol­lars each for millions of Americans. The hope is that

KENYA 

Fighting erupts as election is disputed 
Associated Press 
NAlHOBI -Several people 

were beaten and hacked to 
death with machetes in a 
Nairobi slum Sunday in 
renewed ethnic fighting over 
Kenya's disputed election, resi­
denL<> said. 
Elsewhere, police managed to 

quell more than two days of 
fieree lighting around a Catholic 
monastery that killed 22 people 
and left 200 homes burned in 
the Hif't Valley, 190 miles north­
west of the eapital Nairobi, ofli­
dals said. 
The re-election of President 

Mwai Kibaki has tapped into a 
well of rnsentments that resur­
faces regularly at election time 
in Kenya. But never before has 
it been so prolonged or taken so 
many livns. 
A govnrnment commission 

says more than 600 people have 
been killed in violence that 
erupted after the Dee. 27 elec­
tion. which opposition leader 
Haifa Odinga accused Kibaki of 
stealing. 
As Kibaki's power becomes 

more 1mtrenched each day, the 
opposition's best hope may rest 
in wrangling a power-sharing 
agreement that might make 
Odinga prime minister or vice 
president. International media­
tion has so far failed to broker 
such a deal. 
Odinga has called for another "peitceful protest" on Thursday, saying, "let them bring their guns and we will face them." The protest will take place in del'iancn of a ban and despite the deaths of at least 24 people in three days of protests last week -most of them blamed on police. 
Sunday's bloodshed in Nairobi's Mathare slum. like much of' the lighting sincn the vote, was betwnen the Kikuyu and Luo ethnie groups, said res­ident Boniface Shikami. President Kibaki is a Kikuyu and Odinga is a Luo. 
Shikami said Luos in his strnnt had rnePivnd noti1:es warning tlwm to leave by nightfall or risk attack. 
One man staggernd past with blood streaming from the stump of' his arm. which had been eut ofT with a maclwte. The arm was taken by a group of youths and placed on top of a pile of' stones barrieading an allnyway. 
The maimed man, Peter Kyalo, arrived latnr at Kenyatta llospital. lie said hn was warnnd on Saturday night by Luo friends he might be target­nd bncause he is a Kamba, the sanw tribn as the vice president, a f'ormor prosidential candidate who joinod Kibaki's government this month. 
In a separate incident, around 50 people attacked welder Dominic Owour, a 23-ynar-old l.uo. and tried to cut ofT both his hands at the forearm, Owour said. 
Both nwn said police watehing tho attacks did not intervene. 
Dr. Njoroge Waithaka said 13 pnopln had lwen admitted to Konyat.ta llospital from the area around Matharn. mostly with ax and madwtn ruts on thn upper limbs and head. Filipe Heboiro of' aid group l>oetors Without Bordnrs said his organization had troatnd I 0 IH~ople for ma~hotn and ax wounds on Sunday morning alone. 
Joshua Omukolong, the area 

police chief, confirmed at least 
two people died from overnight 
fighting. 
Resident Moses Ogolla said he 
saw four bodies loaded into a 
police vehicle Sunday morning 
with deep machete cuts. 
"! think it was a gang who 
attacked them because some 
bodies, the head had six, seven, 
eight cuts on it," he said. Ogolla 
said that he believed the victims 
were Luo because he heard rel­
atives conversing in the Luo lan­
guage. "The Luo guys say they 
are going to avenge this." 
In the Rift Valley, around the Catholic Kipkelion Monastery, fighting since Friday has pitted Kalenjin people native to the area against Kisii and Kikuyus who settled there in the 1960s and 1970s. 
Police appeared to have quelled the violence by early Sunday afternoon but still were recovering bodies. 
A local reporter at the seene eounted 14 people dead from machete wounds, three bodies stuck with arrows and five peo­ple shot dead by police. 
The death toll also was con­firmed by district administrator Aden Alhake, who said some 200 homes have been burned down in three days of clashes. 
Land always has been a tool of Kenyan politicians, who dis­tribute it as favors to their own and allied tribes, and use it as a weapon, settling their support­ers in hostile areas in order to win votes at election time. 
In the Hif't Valley, Kalenjin people who feel they have bnen wrongly stripped of their land generally support the opposi­tion. 
Edward Ndirangu, who said two of his houses were razed, was searching for his wife and thrne children. 
"I am not sure about their safety.... We fled as they were looting and torched my homes," he said. 
lie said the Kalenjin were the aggressors. Alhake said 2,500 people taking refuge at three schools and the monastery all worn Kikuyu and Kisii. 
IRAQ 

Shiite holy festival held peacefully 
Muslims begin heading home after celebrating formerly banned ritual 
Associated Press 

BAGHDAD -Hundreds of 
thousands of Shiite Muslims 
clambered aboard buses or 
began trekking homeward on 
foot Saturday at the end of 
Ashoura, a 10-day ritual to _cleanse the spirit and scourge the body in honor of their founding saint. 
The high holy days in Karbala 
passed absent the slaughter of 
pilgrims witnessed in the years 
since the U.S.-led invasion 
nearly half a decade ago, but 
militants did assault gatherings 
of Ashoura worshippers else­
where. 

Fearing a spectacular attack on the masses of self-flagellat­ing faithful who marched on the shrines in Karbala, Iraqi authorities flooded the city with 30,000 police and soldiers. Soviet-made tanks guarded approach roads. 
A relatively uneventful pas­sage of Ashoura had been seen by U.S. and Iraqi officials as a rigorous test of the decline in violence in the country since Washington sent in 30,000 additional troops last year and many Sunni insurgents sudden­ly joined American forces in the fight against al-Qaida in Iraq. 
On Saturday, a rocket slammed into a busy market in the northern city of Tal Afar, killing at least seven people who had completed the ritual and gathered there afterward, according to Najim Abdullah, the mayor. 
Two bombs hidden under trash blasted an Ashoura pro­eession in Kirkuk, killing at least two, said police Brig. Gen. Burhan Tayeb Taha. Kirkuk, 180 miles north of Baghdad, has seen a rise in violence as militants have fled crackdowns elsewhere. 
And earlier in the week 20 people were killed in two sui­cide bombings against groups assembled for Ashoura in Diyala province, the still-violent and religiously mixed territory north of Baghdad. 
But in Karbala, provincial Gov. Aqil al-Khazali said 2 mil­lion Ashoura pilgrims passed 
peacefully through the holy city, 
home to the golden domed 
mosques of Imam Hussein and 
his half brother Imam Abbas. 

The festival, largely banned by Saddam Hussein and his minority Sunni Muslim regime, recalls the death of Hussein, grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, in a seventh cen­tury battle near Karbala. The combat defined the split between Islam's Sunni and Shiite sects. 
Men wearing black or white robes danced in circles and chanted as they swayed in uni­son. 
They pounded their chests, slashed their heads and beat their bloodied foreheads with the flat sides of swords and knives. 
Abbas Mohammed, wearing a black shirt and pants to sym­bolize his grief over Hussein's death, traveled from Baghdad to Karbala. 
"I came ... in defiance of ter­rorists and difliculties," the 41­year-old health ministry employee said. 
Naseer Mohammed, a 35­year-old Karbala resident, spoke with his faee bloodied after he cut his forehead with a sword as part of the rituals. 
"I do not feel any pain despite the blood. The security measures were little bit exces­sive and they ereate delays and difficulties for us, yet they make us feel safer," he said. 
While there was no cata­strophic attack during Ashoura, Sunni and Shiite mili­tants kept up the steady, although diminished, level of violence Saturday in regions to the north. Bombs, suicide assaults, rockets and death squad murder left behind the corpses of at least 21 more Iraqis, including those killed in Kirkuk and Tal Afar. 
In Basra and Nasiriyah, south of Karbala, authorities put the final death toll at 72 when fighting ended Saturday after security forces stormed a mosque and ousted holdout members of the Soldiers of Heaven eult. 
The militants, some of whom reportedly have a number tat­tooed in blue ink on the baek of their necks, seek to invoke chaos as a means of inspiring the return of the "Hidden Imam" -also known as the Mahdi -a descendant of Muhammad who disappeared as a child in the ninth century. Shiites believe he will return one day to bring justice to the world. 
Basra police chief Maj. Gen. Abdul-Jalil Khalaf said at least 44 people were killed in Iraq's second-largest city -seven officers, two civilians and 35 gunmen -while dozens more were wounded and 100 gun­men were arrested.

suburban Atlanta 
home, and the first 

motherly instruction I receive starts, 
"If it's yellow, let it mellow ... " 
Did my family go off the deep end since I've been gone'? Have my par­ents suddenly lost respect for the con­cept of eleanliness? Am I going to have to refer to my mother as Humming Starshine from now on? 
None of the above. I'm from Georgia. Heiterate: Georgia. Deep South, Bible Belt, Dixie. You Midwesterners don't know red until you've ventured farther than a state past tho Mason-Dixon Line. If you hear lhe word "hippie" down there, it's probably preceded by "damn." People aetually started buying larger trueks as a response to the oil short­age seare after Katrina, just to prove that we're Ameriean and will do whatever the hell we want. 
And yet, now, it's in my home state, that same Georgia, where people are starting to take rationing and conser­vation seriously. For those of you unfamiliar with Georgia's current water situation, it's not good. Metro Atlanta draws most of its drinking water from Lake Lanier, a 38,000­acre man-made lake that came into being when the Army Corps of Engineers dammed up the Chattahoochee River in 1956. Georgia gets a decent amount of rain, but the recent frequency of precipitation has been splotchy at best. This summer and fall have been abnormally dry, and the record low water level set this fall, and still lingering, is 19 feet 
below the full lake levels. 
So, because of the scarcity, many households are shifting to the policy of decreased 11ushes. Gradually, yes, but in ways that would invariably earn one "wuss" status even last year. At the University of Georgia, there were designated "flushers" at their last few home games. Saved a bunch of water -in fact, Athons (location of UGA) has decreased its water usage by 10 percent already. Shorter show­ers have become not just a time-saver, but a type of community outreach. 
Dry years happen anywhere, they should be expected. Even the new record low is only half a foot below the previous record low, set in 1981. Why does it seem so much worse this time, then? 
Because Atlanta is the epitome of a boom town. Okay, maybe we can call it a boom city. Back in 1960, metro Atlanta's population was just over a million people. By 1980, we were at 
2.2 million, 4.1 million in 2000, and in 2008, metro Atlanta now has an esti­mated population of 5.3 million peo­ple. 
This kind of growth can not be planned for, no matter how driven or innovative the leadership. Ecosystems cannot sustain such an immense and sudden strain on resources. The same population explosions arc happening in China, India and Africa to much greater degrees and to infrastructures that are much less equipped to handle shortages than our seemingly helpless southern states. We all see, through famine, pollution problems and dis­ease, how impossible it's proving for these foreign, developing regions to respond to stresses of overpopulation. 
The willful ignorance happening in the South -the roommate who feels his showers are a natural right, the household that thinks its toilet needs to be flushed every time to maintain societal respectability -is the invol­untary ignorance plaguing third world countries. They don't have supplies to combat famine or the means to con­trol their population. Our trap is self­inflicted; buying a low-11ow shower­head is economically feasible for most American families. In some communi­ties, plumbers are even installing sim­ilar water-savers for free. 
The point is, we have the resources to counteract our enormous and unsustainable use of natural resources. Other countries don't. But when we take no action, why is it? Because acting, changing, is incon­venient. 
Yet, in places like northern Georgia. the attitude of wasteful pride is start­ing to change. Maybe-okay, defi­nitely-just because we're being forced into it; within four months, Lake Lanier's water lovols may be too low for it to supply northern Georgia with drinking water. But, if one prob­lem can so significantly change the mindsets of an entire subculture in mere months, can't tho rest of us with financial and material possibilities at our fingertips trim down our wasteful lifestyles, just a little'! The next time you go home, are you going to be able to shower the way you're used to? A lot of us won't. A lot of us will be let­ting the toilet mellow. And that may seem gross-with good reason. But it's reality, it's no longer a 11ower­child saying that the rest of society giggles at. And there's something truly humbling in not only accepting that, but also picking up the unfamil­iar yoke and actually carrying it your­self.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Saints found all over campus 
U-WIRE 
Students should explore life without TV 
Like the Church, the Center for Social Concerns is more than a building. The Center is defined primarily by the people who have been making it an active reality for the last 25 years. This year is no difTerent. Although the location is different -behind the Rockne Memorial-the llesh and blood of the Center is every bit as lively as usual. Students are carrying on with regular service locally, nationally and internationally through immer­sion trips, experiential learning, lectures (like the upcoming presentation by William Joyce Wilson Jan. 27 on poverty and inequality), community work, or coursework toward a Catholic Social Teaching minor. The new site is already abuzz with students registering for spring courses, conferences, spring break trips and other service and educational opportunities. 
It is fitting, too, that the diverse community that makes the Center for Social Concerns a flesh and blood reality should be christening the new transitional site just as the Holy Cross community (also known as CSC) celebrated the first feast day for its founder, the recently beatified Basil Moreau, on Sunday. The recent conference at McKenna Hall on saints in the Christian tradition paid great tribute to this essential teaching of the Church. 
The Catholic Church has traditionally understood itself as a community of saints, some who are listed in the canon because of their martyrdom, miracles and lives of exemplary Christian service and faith. Most saints in this Catholic tradition, however, are less well­known. Certainly it is good to recognize how people like Basil Moreau demonstrate how to live out the loving example of Christ in service and faith, but it is also good to recog­nize the saints next door, those who show us the love of Christ by taking out our trash, by recycling, by offering a warm greeting on that cold January morning when we need it most, by calling to see if we need a little more money to pay for textbooks this semester. 
It is this long tradition of serving together, praying together and acting in loving soli­darity of our neighbor near and far that provides the flesh and blood of the living Church on earth. You don't have to go to the Center for Social Concerns to fmd saints in our midst. If you do come to the new Center site, however, you will likely bump into some extraordinary people.

Once upon a time, people would go out almost every night of the week, whether over to the neighbors' place for dinner or out to a club for dinner and dancing or sim­ply over to the local theater for a movie and newsreel. This was before the entertainment leviathan that is tele­vision appeared.

out others for entertainment; com­munities were closer because, on some level, people had nothing better to do. 
Not all television is bad; it has helped us learn more about our world. We have access to 24-hour news, round-the-clock weather reports, how-to shows for virtu­ally any project you can imagine, documentaries on any number of things from past, present and future, and some truly quality programming.

ple ofthe everyday American diet. Gamecock 
That being said, the fact of the matter is that McDonald's puts out a greasy, meaty, salty and unde­niably savory product, one that ifcon­sumed often, will spur an increase in one's daily caloric intake and may lead to other health problems related with dra­matic weight gain. 
The standard unit of the McDonald's operation, the value meal, generally con­sists of a sandwich, a collection offries and a soft drink, but when did a yoga DVD sneak into the bag? 
I recently found a collection of McDonald's fitness DVDs lying around my house during winter break and became confused. 
Suspecting a joke, I questioned my mom on the actual contents of the discs and was reaffirmed that these were, in fact, 15-minute fitness oriented videos that could be obtained at the same place Ronald McDonald hangs out. 
While all the emphasis on becoming more fit and leading a healthier and more active lifestyle is certainly a positive thing, is McDonald's really the right place to turn to for advice regarding fitness? 
Comedian Lewis Black often refers to IHOP as his health club, but they're not enlisting the service offitness experts and providing a series of DVDs with focus on aerobic fitness and flexibility. 
It seems McDonald's is combating the growing problem ofobesity in America by providing such discs, and such nutri­tional information as well as promoting a more active lifestyle, but why can't Ijust have my extra-large value meal in all its glory? 
When I walk into McDonald's, I'm not there for the fitness tips or the yoga DVDs. I don't want to be hassled by Ronald to get active. I want my Quarter Pounder with cheese and no pickles, a large fry and a large Coke. 
Burger joints like McDonald's are try­ing to recreate themselves to seem more fitness oriented in order to remain popu­lar among consumer Americans, but there's got to be a line drawn on just how far they're going. 
McDonald's should stop wasting money trying to appeal to the obsessive nutri­tionist and just worry about doing what they do best, serving up the grease. 
Once in a while, it couldn't hurt to grab a Big Mac.

The views expressed in this column are those ofthe author and not necessarily those ofThe Observer. 
TV is an easy way for society to gain access to and dis­seminate information. It has become an ingrained part of our society, and I doubt that it's going away any time soon. 
However, there are some truly abysmal things on TV, and I'm convinced that some shows are actually making people dumber and actively contributing to our deterio­rating sense of community. 
Content aside, however, it seems that TV has usurped a place in our society that people used to fill. They've been replaced by televised stand-ins. I think that, in the end, we are worse off because of it. No longer does there seem to be a strong level ofinvolvement in our communities. 
We have our distinct social circles in which we are active; we share our experiences with our close personal friends and family. But how many of you can truly claim to be a part of your community -or even your school's community? 
Instead of going out to meet people, taking part in activities or socializing with others, I think we often sit and watch TV. It's easier and a lot less work, but you also 
get less out of it.

This is part of a larger trend in American culture toward privacy and personal space. When we no longer rely on each other for entertainment, we lose something in our appreciation of others. 
And this phenomenon is destroying, or at the very least changing, what community means to America. 
I am not sure much can be done to change this phe­nomenon in our society, but you can take a stand in your personal life. 
You're probably not ready to give up TV altogether (although I assure you can, in fact, live very well without it), so instead be cognizant ofjust how much time you spend in front of the idiot box. 
Take note of what else you could be doing instead of watching TV, and think about what you're missing out on.

By TAE ANDREWS Scene Editor 

Notre Dame graduate-turned­rapper Napoleon Suarez cites two sources of inspiration for his second album, "American Scholar:" actor Denzel Washington and rapper Jay-Z. The pair recently collaborated on the critically acclaimed blockbuster film "American Gangster," with Washington providing the on-screen bril­liance and Jay-Z supplying an album by the same name. The film depicts the rise to fame, fortune and ultimate fall of Frank Lucas, a heroin kingpin in Harlem during the late 1960s and early 1970s. 
"I am a huge Jay-Z fan and I appreciated the album for what it was," Suarez said. "I felt it was a glamorization of the life of a gangster. His lyrics offered genuine insight into the life of a hustler who rose from noth­
ing to something. He touched along a different path," h on the drugs, the money, the said. "School was my hustle women, and 'the life.' Jay Instead of being in the stre

"[The first album] was me and only me. I had my whole life to create it," he said. "The

Suarez also collab­orates with a few dif­ferent artists on

and fellow performer Lawrence Santiago, also of for­mer Notre Dame fame due to his involve­ment with the band Bajawalla. Santiago puts in an appearance on "Scholar," singing on one of the songs on the album. "It came out incredible," Suarez 
said. 
Napoleon Suarez also said that he plans on spending less time worrying this year and more time working on his craft. 
"I really stressed myself in '07 worrying about getting a record deal and getting my foot in the door," he said. "I felt like I wasn't a good artist because I wasn't signed. I now know that I don't need a deal to prove my talent." Suarez said that positive feedback from friends and fans alike continues to spur his efforts on. 
"That type of feedback is what drives me and makes me want to be in the studio until two in the morning when I have to wake up at six for work," he said. "Having a deal would be nice, but I know I'm good at what I do." 
Suarez also said that he has a few new projects in the works, including collaborating with both Notre Dame's own "Da Natural" Jeffery Stephens and some acts from his hometown. "You are going to hear a lot of music from me this year," he said, "but more from the pro­duction side." 
Suarez says that "Eastside High" is his favorite single from "American Scholar," although he finds that his per­sonal favorites often do not align with his fans' favorites. "When I make music, my favorite song is always every­one's least favorite," he said, "even when I produce beats for

other artists. It's funny how that works out sometimes." 
Suarez is currently in the midst of a college tour, intend­ed as a gesture of appreciation for his fans. Part of that tour included a stop at Legends November 15 of last year. "My alma mater has always been my biggest supporter," he said. "The people are why we do the music in the first place. I guess you can call it a thank you for everyone showing us support."

Associated Press 

ST. PAUL, Minn. -The more Evan Lysacek tries to downplay his rivalry with Johnny Weir, the bigger it gets. 
They're the two best male skaters the United States has, and two of the best in the world. They're chasing the same medals and the same titles, glories that can't be shared. And at a time when the United States is searching for new stars, their back-and-forth on the podium is the best thing going. 
But getting one of them to acknowledge it, Lysacek in particular, is tougher than a quadruple jump. 
"(Coach Frank Carroll) 
says, 'Mind your own busi­ness in every respect of word,"' Lysacek said. "Don't think about any­body else. The less energy I spend thinking about somebody else is more energy I can put into my own skating, and that's where I want my energy to be. 
"The media can say what they want," he added. "That's their freedom, they can say anything they want. About me, about Johnny Weir, about any other competitor. My focus is on me." 
Sorry, Evan. Ignore it all you want, but at this week's U.S. Figure Skating Championships, the latest installment of "Ice Wars: 
Johnny vs. Evan" is the main event. 
Competition begins Wednesday with compul­sory dance and the pairs short program. The men's short program is Friday, and the final is Jan. 27. The women begin Thursday. 
"We have a great rivalry developing here in the men in both Evan and Johnny," said David Raith, executive director of U.S . Figure Skating. "I think that's very exciting." 
Figure ·skating is oh, so pretty, as much art as ath­leticism, and fans love gracefur, lyrical skaters like Michelle Kwan and Sasha Cohen. But for those folks who don't know a lutz from a loop, it's rival­ries that get their atten­tion. That Tonya-Nancy dustup may have taken things to the extreme, but get a couple of skaters pushing each other for those precious spots on the podium, and you've got yourself a show. 
The 1988 Olympics had the "Battle of the Brians" and "dueling Carmens." Kwan was at her best when Tara Lipinski and Cohen were nipping at her skates. And Alexei Yagudin's competition with fellow Russian Evgeni Plushenko made for great theater -on and off the ice. 
Now there's Lysacek and Weir. 
IN BRIEF 

Boxer bies to make comeback 
in ymmg man's sport 
NEW YORK-Back when Roy Jones Jr. was the best boxer in the world, most people thought his sport was dying. Now that boxing is back on the rise with one big fight after another, Jones is aching for a comeback of his own. 
But even after Jones danced around Felix Trinidad to win a unanimous deci­sion at Madison Square Garden on Saturday night, the 39-year-old will have to wait for the big-money matchups he's craving. 
After all, he didn't take those lights when he first had the chance. The 1990s' best pound-for-pound fighter was well-known for playing defense both inside and outside the ring, and now he's dropped well down the list of boxing's biggest names. 
He'll have to get in line for fighters who once would have loved to meet hlm -but don't tell that to Jones, who still sees himself as the biggest name in any room. 
Frenchman sails around 
globe in 57 days, beats record 
BREST, France -Francis Joyon had no heat, no companions and little sleep for nearly two months as he sailed around the globe. Now he has a stunning world record. 
The 51-year-old Frenchman cir­cled the planet alone in 57 days, 13 hours, 34 minutes, 6 seconds in a trimaran, shattering the record set by Ellen MacArthur by two weeks and beating his own expectations. 
"It's a bit of a shock" to be among so many people again, Joyon said after hitting land on France's Atlantic coast Sunday morning. He crossed an imaginary finish line in the water overnight, and said it was like "landing on the moon'' when he reached shore. 
Joyon skirted the southern reaches of the globe in his 95-foot, 9-ton trimaran IDEC, a craft he built with parts gathered from other boats. 
Miller wins title, becomes 
most successful U.S. skier 
KITZBUEHEL, Austria -Bode Miller finally had something to cheer about Sunday at the traditional Hahnenkamm World Cup races. 
Earlier this week, he accused organiz­ers of making the famous Streif downhill course much bumpier and dangerous than it already was. He also criticized organizers for disrespecting the 68-year­old history of the event by changing the slalom course. 
But on Sunday, Miller won the com­bined title for the slalom and Saturday's downhill, which means he is now the most successful American skier ever with 28 World Cup wins, overtaking Phil Mahre. 
"It's a nice record, something you 
-
dream about as a kid," the 30-year-old Miller said. "As a professional skier, you're more focused on winning each individual race. Before the season, it was my target to break that record, and it's a really good feeling ifyou reach your goals."

ment, was as good as we've played all year in the second half," Sampson said. "We had maybe two turnovers. That's just a high level of play.... The second half was outstanding at both ends." 
Penn State (1 0-7, 2-3), which lost leading scorer and rebounder Geary Claxton with a season-ending knee injury against Wisconsin on Tuesday, came out strong, stayed with the Hoosiers most of the game and led 52-51 before a 3­pointer by Gordon started a 14-4 run that put Indiana in control. White had Indiana's next five points and assisted on another basket by Jamarcus Ellis, and the Hoosiers began pulling away for good. 
"It was a stretch where we needed to pick it up," White said. "We needed somebody to step up and the guards did a good job finding me open at the right time. 
"There's always a lot of work to be done. That's what prac­tices are for, to get better each game." 
White, Gordon, Ellis, Armon Bassett and Lance Stemler played all 20 minutes in the second half. 
"It all started with our defense," Ellis said. "Even in the second half, we came out a little lackadaisical but we started to pick it up the last 7­8 minutes. We knew they were going to play hard without Claxton." 
Two free throws by Talor Battle were the only points by the Nittany Lions in the next 4 minutes after White's scoring burst, and two free throws by Gordon, a 3-pointer by Bassett and a layup by Gordon pushed Indiana's lead to 72-58. Penn State, which has never won in 15 games at Assembly Hall, never came closer than 12 points the rest of the way, and Indiana took its biggest lead at 81-60 in the closing seconds. 
"We were trying to keep them away from the basket. We got a little sort with our zone," Penn State coach Ed DeChellis said. "We hit that lit­tle stretch there where we 
weren't really active.... We were OK for 30 minutes; unfortunately, this is a 40­minute game." 
Bassett added 1 7 points and Ellis finished with 12 for the Hoosiers. Battle, a freshman, had a career-high 20 points and Jamelle Comley added 19 for Penn State. Freshman Jeff Brooks, who started in place of Claxton, had six points. 
"This is the first time out without him," DeChellis said of the loss of Claxton. "Talor played well, Jamelle played well. We just need to find another guy who can score." 
Despite the loss of Claxton, who was second in the Big Ten in scoring and rebounding, the Nittany Lions stayed with Indiana in the first half, even after a 10-0 run gave the Hoosiers an early 12-6 lead. 
Four of Penn State's first five field goals were 3-pointers, then a basket and two free throws by Carnley and a 3­pointer by Stanley Pringle tied the game for the first time at 
22. After a turnover by Indiana, Pringle was fouled on a layup and converted the three.-point play with a free throw for a 25-22 lead. 
There were two more ties and three lead changes over the final 5 minutes of the first half. 
Gordon's fourth 3-pointer tied the game at 32, then Ellis stole the ball, was fouled and hit both free throws to put the Hoosiers back in front. After a turnover by Penn State, Lance Stemler hit a 3-pointer for the Hoosiers before Battle's basket in the final seconds made it 37-34 at the break. 
A 3-pointer by Battle gave Penn State its final lead at 52­51, and a basket by Cornley tied it for the final time at 54 before two straight baskets by White put Indiana ahead to stay. 
"Unfortunately, they hit some pretty deep 3s and pene­trated the zone, whieh allowed them to get some easy bas­kets," Carnley said. "Hight now, we're trying to figure out who's going to step up. We're searching right now."

Pair of -weekend losses eclipse ilnproved titnes 
By ELLYN MICHALAK Sports Writer 

Notre IJame cam11 into the sea­
son with high expeetations but so 
f'ar has railed to produce msults, 
falling twice this weekend in dual 
meel'i. 

I:ntnring llw weekend with a 3­4 record. tho No. 24 Irish strug­gled at home against Louisville. Arter tho 166-1 34 loss to the Cardinals f'or the first time in live years, the Irish headed to Evanston, Ill., to face No. 17 Northwestern. Notm Dame's per­. lilrmanco Iilli short. and the Irish 
lost to the Wildcal'i, 189-111. 

Dt1spitn the losses, Irish coach 
Tim Welsh said the weekend 
showed improvement in his 
ttmm. 

"We swam a lot faster this 
weekend," Welsh said. "If you 
think of the season as a proeess 
or getting fastnr, then we got bet­
ter and swam well this weekend. 
If you look at the season and 
gauge your progress only based 
on wins and losses, then we did­
n't improve this weekend. 

"We look at the entire season 
as a process of improving and 
sinee it is getting dose to champi­
onship time, our main goal is to 
bncome faster swimmers." 

Despite Friday's home loss, 
Irish junior Michael Bulfin broke 
a school diving previously set by 
Andy Maggio in 2002 with a 
scorn or 387.45 in the 3-meter boards. 
The Irish were quick, taking second place in most events, but Louisville swam faster. The only events the Irish dominated were the 1-meter and 3-meter board. The Irish took the top four spots in both events: Bulfin led, senior Sam Stoner took second, and freshman Eric Lex and senior Steven Crowe followed in third and fourth place in each event. 
After less than 24 hours of rest, the Irish swimmers hit the road to compete against Northwestern. The results were comparable to those of Friday's meet. 
Sophomore John Lytle led the Irish, grasping first place in both the 50-yard and 1 00-yard free. Bulfin, again, took lirst in the 3­meter boards, while freshman Nathan Geary and Stoner fin­ished in third and fourth place, rnspectively. 
This weekend, the Irish will host the Shamrock dual meet, where they will face defending Big East champion West Virginia. 
"This weekend is a major event for us," Welsh said. "It's our last home meet, it's our last dual meet and for seniors, it's their last meet in their home pool." 
The Irish will compete against unranked West Virginia at both 9 
a.m. and 4 p.m. Saturday at Rolf.<; Aquatic Center.

Resounding victories against Penn State, Toledo highlight start of2008 
point. Junior Brett Helgeson and senior Sheeva Parbhu dominated Adam Slagter and Eddie Bouehier at the one doubles spot. 
"They return as well as any­body," Irish coach Bobby Bayliss said. 

"Havens has played great for us. He has great timing and shot making, he will learn to play with more discipline." 
Bobby Bayliss Irish coach 
Roth finished the top three singles sweep with a win over Bouchier 7-5,6-2. 
The four and five singles for the Irish both fell in tough matches. Havens fell 6­3, 6-2 to Lynch. David Anderson fell 
"They have made great improvements this season." 
Senior Andrew Hath and Stephen Havens defeated Michael James and James Dwyer, 8-4, in the first com­pleted doubles match. Santiago Montoya and Tyler Davis fell to Brendan Lynch and Hyan Gormley for the only Irish doubles loss. 
"Davis has made great adjustments, and flattened out his forehand, and battles well," Bayliss said. "Montoya in three sets to Hyan Gormley, 6-4, 3-6, 1-0 (10­
8). 

"llavens has played great for us," Bayliss said. "He has great timing and shot mak­ing, he will learn to play with more discipline. Anderson is learning to play net to complement his great groundstrokes." 
Daniel Stahl was able to pull out a tight match over Dwyer, 3-6, 7-6 (7-3), 1-0. 
The Irish defeated the Nittany Lions 5-2 in the early match.

The Irish unexpectedly fell at the hands of Toledo the next day. 
"Toledo swam very well, much better than they've been all year, and they sur­prised us in that," White said. 
The Rockets evened up the all-time dual-meet record between the two schools at 1-1 and snapped Notre Dame's two-meet win streak. 
"We messed around with the line-up a little, tried some other people out in dif­ferent relays to see what they could do," White said. 
Lexi Shue was able to win the 1,000-yard freestyle and set a new pool-record in Toledo. Her time of 10:05.09 broke the previous record of 10:08.62, and was also a season best for Shue.

Despite first-half struggles, the Belles came together in the sec­ond half to defeat Tri-State 7 4­71 Saturday at Angela Athletic Facility. 
The win, the Belles' second in a row by three points, pulled them to 8-7 overall and 4-3 in the MIAA. This was also Saint Mary's second victory over Tri­State this year, -the first came when they won 82-68 at Tri­State on Dec. 8. 
Tho Thunder began the game on a 7-0 run, led by guard Sarah Howe and forward Kristnn .Julian. Tri-State led for tho entire first half. The Belles narrowed the gap to four, end­ing the half down 36-32, but didn't lc~ad until sophomore Anna Kammrath seored 3:57 into tho second half, to go up

Irish earn spots at Opener 
By EUGENIA ALFONZO and

Sports Wrilers 

Notre Dame sent a clear message that it didn't let up its intensity over winter break by earning Big East qualifica­tions in sprint, distance and field events this weekend at the Notre Dame Indoor Opener. 
The short and middle sprints gave a boost to the Irish. Freshman Miklos Szebeny in the 60-meter meter dash. sophomore Jeff Farnell in the 200-meter dash and freshman Austin Wechter in the 500­rneter dash all finished in the top thrnn with Big liast cham­pions h i p q u a I i fy i n g times . S1~nior Jose Genao and fresh­man Matt Moore also qualified for thn Big East med in the 60-mntnr hurdles. 
Thn Irish also ran wnll in the distance raens. Junior Daniel Clark and freshman Spnncer Carter ran strong mile times, finishing first and fourth rnspnelively. Sophomore Balazs Molnar. junior Billy Buzaid and sophomore Jack lloward made a dean sweep in the 800-meter dash, coming out first, sneond and third, respectively. Senior Jamal Afridi and sophomore Jim Notwnll also impressed com­petitors by c:oming out on top in the 1000-meter run. 
Field events also played a part in sealing the team's suc­cess at the meet. With impres­sive jumps, sophomore Eric Quick qualified for the Big East in both the triple and long jump, improving his per­sonal record. Also, freshmen throwers Denes Veres and Greg Davis qualified for the Big East and dominated the shot put and weight throw respectively. 
Notre Dame hasn't competed in six weeks, but it didn't show this weekend as the Irish took first in multiple events at the Notre Dame Indoor Opener. 
"We wanted to use Friday night's competition to see where we are after the long break," said Notre Dame coach Tim Connelly. 
With the return of senior Sunni Olding and freshman Marissa Treece, the women's mile was once again a strong event for the Irish. Treeee ran the best time of the season for tho Irish, 5:01.96. good for seeond place in the event. 
Amy Kohlmeier and ()[ding finished just seconds behind Treece to claim third and fourth, respectively. All three runners qualified for the Big East championships in February with their times. 
Thrower Anna Weber also gave a strong performance for Notre Dame with wins in the weight throw with a toss of 58-3 and the shot put with a throw of 44-11?. Weber had already qualified for the Big East championships, but these marks improved her standing among the competition. 
The Irish also dominated the

teams exchanging leads five limes before the Belles finally look a 74-71lead on a 3-pointer by junior guard Katie Hashid with 1:18 left. 
After dodging the Thunder's last-second attempt to tie, Saint Mary's celebrated their first at home since Dec. 28 against Kenyon. 
Senior guard Alison Kessler followed up her school-reeord 41-point performance against Kalamazoo with 16 points against the Thunder. Rashid netted 11 of her own to round out the Belles' leading seorers. 
Many second-ehance points 
and fast breaks sprung forth from superb rebounding from Belles forwards Newsom and Kammrath, who combined for 25 boards. 
Becky Newsom came off the bench to deliver 12 points and five rebounds in a perfeet shoot­ing performance, going three-. for-three from the lield and con­verting all six of her free throws. 
Saint Marys' next game will be Wednesday at Calvin, where they will try to avenge a 67-52 loss earlier in the season.

The Irish sprinters also found great success in Friday's meet. In the 400­meter race, Joanna Schultz and Cora Dayan claimed the top two spots for the Irish. Schultz finished with a time of 
56.87 seconds with teammate Dayan just a step behind her. Schultz also took second in the 200-meter later in the meet. 
Kelly Langhans took first in 
the 800-meter  - her first

In the 1,000-meter run, Jacqueline Carter clocked in at 2:57.41, which was good for third place and a spot in the Big East championships. 
With the return of Carter, Kohlmeier, Treece and Olding from injuries and illnesses, the Irish should be ready and at full strength for their next meet, Friday's Notre Dame Invitational.

Michigan 
continued from page 24 
Saturday the two teams faced off in The Palace at Auburn Hills in what was teehnically an Irish home game. It was the sixth time Notre Dame has played at The Palace, five times against Michigan, and all resulted in losses. 
In the first game on Friday, Notre Dame jumped out to a 2­0 lead in the first period on goals from forwards Kevin Deeth and Justin White. Deeth scored 3:33 into the game when his wrist shot deflected ofT a defenseman's stick and over Michigan goaltender Billy Sauer. White's goal came two minutes later on a two-on-one when Irish winger Ryan Guentzel drew the defender toward him, opening White up for the pass and goal. 
They were the last goals the Irish would score as the Wolverines netted two in the second from Kevin Porter and Matt Hust to tie the game 2-2. 

"We have to start doing more battling in the front of the net," .Jackson said. "We've been playing against very good goal­tenders.... We can try to work on those things in practice, but it's going to boil down to guys getting gritty in front of the

that bad of a game," sopho­more point guard Tory .Jackson said. "Wn missed a lot of open shots. The game would have benn a lot closer if we had knocked down shots." 
Despite shooting poorly, the Irish kept the contest dose early, taking the lead 17-16 on a three pointer by sopho­more guard .Jonathan Peoples with IJ:50 left in the llrst half. 
Georgetown (14-2, 4-1 Big 1\ast) took the lead back on the next possession and then scored tlw next 13 points to net." 
With 20 seconds left in the game. Michigan forward Louie Caporusso banged home a rebound past Irish goalie Jordan Pearce (25 saves) to give the Wolverines the 3-2 win. 
"We lost the draw and lost coverage," Jackson said. "It was just an uncharacteristic thing that happened, we just lost sight of the guy we were covering." 
Jackson replaced Pearce in net with 17 -year-old freshman Brad Phillips for Saturday's 5-1 loss in the Palace, starting only his fifth game of the season behind the junior Pearce. Phillips lasted two periods, allowing four goals on 19 shots, before Pearce was put back in net for the third. Pearce allowed no goals on 10 shots in the third. 
"I had to put the young kid in to see how he would do in that environment," Jackson said. "I basically know what I'm going to get from Jordan Pearce. I need Jordan to elevate his game another level. I needed to see if Phillips could handle it, and he probably put a lot of pressure on himself." 
Michigan scored two goals in the first and two more in the second to get a 4-1 lead going into the third. The Wolverines added the fifth on an empty-net goal. 
The lone Notre Dame goal of the night was scored at 14:38 of the first period by freshman Ben Hyan, who got an open pass in front of the net from sophomore Dan Kissel to tie the game at 1-1. 
One large part of Notre Dame's lack of offense has been its inability to convert on power play chances. In Friday's 3-2 loss, the Irish were given a five­minute man advantage just two minutes into the third period when Michigan defenseman Chris Summers was whistled for checking from behind. 
The major penalty came when the game was deadlocked 2-2. but the Irish couldn't get one shot on net during the power play. 
"We have to start doing more away from the puck," Jackson said. "Defensively, we've been good, we haven't given up a lot. The problem is until last night, if we score one power play goal a game. we'd probably be 7-1 [since break]. 
"[The power play is] in our minds. Everybody's talking about it, everybody's making a big issue on it. Eventually one is going to go in off a skate or off our butt and we're going to start being productive again."

The game wasn't all about big numbers from the Irish. I-Ioya Kieraah Marlow had a career-high 34 points and finished with 13 rebounds. Kristin Heidloff and Meredith Cox also aided in Georgetown's drive, posting double figures with 14 and 10 points, respectively. Marlow's performance demonstrated a need for

"We've got a lot of work to do defensively," McGraw said. "Marlow had a career night for Georgetown tonight." 
One key defensive area for the Irish is limiting the num­ber of fouls they commit. Peters fouled out with 4:46 left in the second half and Ashley Barlow finished the game with four. Notre Dame allowed· 22 fouls on the

Erica Williamson, Lindsay Schrader, Melissa Lechlitner and Becca Bruszewski rounded out the seven Irish players to reach double fig­ures, combining to give Notre Dame a huge offensive win.

At halftime, Irish coach Mike Brey switched to a 2-:~ zone to try to keep the ball players scored in double fig­ures. Guard DeJuan Summers put in 17, while forwards Austin Freeman and Jessie Sapp added 16 and 14 respectively. 
The lloyas shot 53 percent from the field. 
The Irish were led by soph­omore forward Luke Ilarangody, who scored 13 points but shot only 3-of-13 from the field. llarangody was hold well below his sea­son average of 18.9 points by Hibbert and the other Georgetown big men. 
Guards Kyle McAiarney and Peoples also scored in double figures. Peoples' 12 points were a career-high. 
With the win, Georgetown sits alone in first place in the Big East at 4-1 in eonl"erm1ce play. The Irish fell into a six­way tie for third at 3-2. Two teams -Cincinnati and DePaul -sit half a game back of the Hoyas in second place at 4-2. 
"Wp're not going to put our heads down," Jackson said. "It's a long season. Wn still have a shot at being number one in the Big East." 
The Irish will have another chance to redeem themselves on the road in their next game, Saturday against No. 21 Villanova in Philadelphia. The Wildcats are 13-:1 overall this season and are one of the five teams tied with Notre Dame at 3-2 in the confer­ence.

CANCER (June 21-July 22): Emotional matters will surface and someone you have to deal with will overreact. Try your best to listen before you say something you may live to regret. Someone you respect may be able to shed light on your situation. 3 stars 
LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): A rather sudden change in your financial situation may lead to unrealistic spending. Double check your balance before you hit the stores. Being gen­erous is a nice gesture but not if it will cause you unnecessary worry. 3 stars 
VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): You can make some fabulous changes to your living quar­ters today by using your expertise, your eye for a good deal and all the help you can muster up from friends and relatives. Change is good when the end result gives you a new lease on life. 4 stars 
LIBRA (Sept. 23-0ct. 22): Talk, travel and learning something new should all be pen­ciled in. Your creative insight and enthusiasm will result in an interesting idea and pos­sibly a profitable proposal. Don't let emotional issues spoil your plans. 2 stars 
SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): If you really want to do something, go it alone but do follow through. You don't have to rely on others as much as you think you do. It's up to you, not anyone else to make things happen and move along. 5 stars 
SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): You'll be looking for action and anyone who slows you down had better watch out. You will be in a fighting mood not likely to budge. Make sure you've covered all the bases before you forge ahead. 3 stars 
CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Set a new budget or financial game plan that will help you get all the little extras you want in your life. You deserve to be pampered for a change. Now is the time to start to plan for your future. 3 stars

PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): Don't let love confuse you or anyone talk you into doing things you don't want to do. Trust your own heart. Not everyone will like the choices you make but it's you who has to live with them. 5 stars 
Birthday Baby: You are emotional and sensitive, a great friend and a warm compan­ion. You can differentiate between what you want and wh;lt you need. You are great at finding solutions.

ND loses twice to UM; fifth loss in eight games 
By KYLE CASSILY Sports Writer 
The No. 8 Irish were arguably one of the hottest teams in the nation entering the Christmas break, but since the return from the holidays Notre Dame has been anything but. 

The Irish (18-9-1, 11-6-1 CCIIA) have gone 2-5-1 in that stretch, including 3-2 and 5-1 losses this weekend on the road to No. 1 Michigan. The ofl'ense has scored only 14 goals in eight games, and the power play unit was unable to convert on its nine chances against the Wolverines (22-2, 15-1 CCIIA), extending its futile streak to eight games and 39 chances. 
''I've been concerned about this since last week," Notre Dame eoach Jell' Jackson said. "It's not an issue of us playing brutal. We're playing fairly well, we're just not getting enough ofl'ensive oomph in our game."

Irish dUlllp 104 points onHoyas 
By DEIRDRE KRASULA 
Sports Writer 

As the halftime buzzer sounded, senior Charel Allen hit a 3-pointer to give Notre Dame the 48-42 lead and the momentum to pull off a 104­86 win over Georgetown Saturday in Washington, D.C. 
Allen, who finished with 14 points, was one of seven Irish players to score double digits and help the Irish break 100 points on the road for the first time in school history. 
Notre Dame emerged from the locker room in the second half with a six-point lead and never looked back. The Irish shot 72 percent from the field in the second half en route to their victory over the Hoyas. The game gave the Irish a chance to do what they do best-run the ball. 
"We were trying to run, we like to run, push the ball and transition," Notre Dame coach Muffet McGraw said. "We just had a lot more opportunities

Road woes trail team still 
Georgetawn dominates in post to seal victory

The road has not been kind 

to Notre Dame. 
The Irish (13-4, 3-2 Big East) fell to 2-4 on the sea­son away from the Joyee C11nter with an 84-65 loss to No. 6 Georgntown Saturday at thn Verizon Center in Washington, D.C. 
The loss eame just one week after a similarly dis­hnartening road defeat, 92­66 at the hands of Marquette in Milwaukee. Notre Dame is 11-0 at home this season, but has yet to capture that same swagger in other ven­ues. 
Senior captain Hob Kurz said he bnlieves the Irish have it in tlwm to win on the road. 
"We're going to get this right," lw said. "We've got seven more road games." 
But first thny'll have to 11x their shooting. Against the lloyas, Notre Dame made just :n percent or its shots from tlHl f'ield, including going 7-for-25 from behind the 3-point arc.

No. 9 Notre Dame tops Cardinals 6-1 on road 
By LORENZO REYES Sports Writer 

Looking to build on their success this fall, No. 9 Notre Dame kicked off the 2008 dual match season Sunday with a solid 6-1 victory over Louisville at the Bass-Rudd Tennis Center in Louisville, Ky. 
"It was a great start," Irish coach Jay Louderback said. "It was good to go on the road into unfamiliar environment and come out on top. Louisville is much better than they were last year. They have much better depth, and to beat them on the road was big for us." 
Notre Dame started off in doubles play, picking up the point in convincing fashion. 
Improving to 12-2 on the year, the duo of senior Brook Buck and junior Kelcy Tefft defeated Cardinals junior Bianca Gorbea and sopho­more Natalia Baez 8-4. 
The No. 50 pair of sopho­mores Kali Krisik and Colleen Rielley improved to 5-1 on the season, besting Louisville sophomore Lauren Imre and junior Lindsey Jones 8-5. 
Although the doubles point had been secured, the tag­team of sophomore Cosmina 
Ciobanu and freshman Kristen Hafael also improved to 5-1 on the season, and made it a clean sweep for the Irish in doubles play with their 8-7 triumph over sopho­more Jo-Ann Van Aerde and senior Hobyn White. 
Heading into singles play with a 1-0 lead, the Irish did­n't hold back and continued their aggressive approach, picking up five more points on the path to victory. 
Krisik disposed of freshman Katherina Tomalak in straight sets, 6-3, 6-2. The sophomore made it 2-0 for Notre Dame, while improving her record to 10-2 on the year. 
Kelcy Tefft kept the Irish momentum rolling with a 6-0, 6-2 straight-set victory over Baez. Tefft is now 5-3 on the year and, more importantly, gave her team another valu­able point. 
With Louisville's chances of' winning then unlikely, Ciobanu put an end to the notion of a Cardinals come­back. The sophomore clinched the match with her 6-2, 6-3 straight-set victory over lmre to improve her standing to 12-4 on the sen­
