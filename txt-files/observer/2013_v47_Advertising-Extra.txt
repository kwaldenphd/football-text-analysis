ADVERTISE WITH THE OBSERVER


Allan Joseph
Editor-in-Chief

Dear Advertiser,
We’ve got big news for you — The Observer will be sporting a brand-new look this fall. After countless hours and many drafts, we’ve come up with a new de­sign that’s cleaner, easier to read and more attractive than ever before. While this is great news for our read­ers, it’s even better for you because more people are going to notice, read and act on your ads.
To introduce you to our new design and some of the new programs we’re adding for our advertisers, we’ve put together this media kit. We printed this kit on the same paper The Observer is printed on each and every day because we wanted you to see exactly what read­ers will pick up when they’re reading the paper in the dining hall, in their dorm rooms or perhaps out on the quad. We think you’ll be able to see why the new de­sign is going to draw more eyes to your ads. 
But that’s just the start of why we created this for you.
In addition to all of our standard ad sizes, prices and publication dates, we’ll show you our brand-new discount packages for purchases of print and online advertising. You’ll learn more about our ex­tremely popular website, which has been nominated for the 2011-2012 Online Pacemaker Award from the Associated Collegiate Press. If you turn to page 4, you’ll see why we think advertising in color is abso­lutely worth the extra cost. In addition, you’ll see why our ad design team can make your ad jump off the page. In short, everything you need to advertise with us in the upcoming year is contained inside this kit. 
We’re extremely proud of our new design, which brings The Observer a fresh feel for the future. The things you know and love about advertising with us won’t change — we’re still the best way to reach Notre Dame and Saint Mary’s students, and we’re still a fa­vorite among alumni, especially those who regularly return to South Bend. We’re only going to get better, and we’re excited for you to be a part of it.
If you have any suggestions for improving our ad­vertising experience or have any questions about our changes, please don’t hesitate to contact me.
Thanks so much for advertising with us. We’re look­ing forward to working with you this year and in the future.
Sincerely,
Allan Joseph
