SUFR stages day-long sit-in in Registrar's office 
U.S. troops move north to scout sites for refugee camps 
Observer Staff Report 
A group of 60 students staged a day-long sit-in Wednesday in the Registrar's office demanding open negotiation with University President Father Edward Malloy regard­ing the demands raised by members of Students United for Respect (SUFR). 
The sit-in, held on the first floor of the Administration Building, began at 8 a.m. and ended just after 7 p.m. 
Throughout the day, the sit-in attracted upwards of 150 black, white, and Hispanic demonstrators outside and in­side the office, complete with blankets, pillows, radios, and often chanting, "What do we want?... Respect. When do we want it? ... Now." 
Demonstrators bore signs that read, "God is not color blind," and "No queremos 'SUFRir mas," which is Spanish for "We don't want to suffer/SUFR anymore." 
After almost 12 hours of dis­cussion and negotiation, the students agreed to leave the office, A smaller group of stu­dents, under the auspices of Student Government, were scheduled to meet with Malloy in his room at 12:30 a.m. today. 
SUFR said they planned to regroup at 7:30 a.m. today in the 24-hour lounge of LaFor­tune Student Center. After dis­cussing the meeting with Mal­loy, the group would decide

Intelligence played major role in the Gulf War, says CIA director Webster

Webster spoke to a packed li­brary auditorium Wednesday night as part of the Student Government sponsored "Public Forum on Contemporary Is­sues" leeture series. 
"The global scope and use of intelligence during the Gulf War was extraordinary," said Web­ster. 
"Intelligence on issues rang­ing from Iraqi military capabil­ities to sanctions busting to counter-terrorism, all helped toward the international coop­eration and resolve that we saw Turkey and its border and nearly 1.5 million others have sought safety in Iran and along its frontier, according to the latest estimates. 

The Iraqi News Agency quoted Iraq's foreign minister, Ahmed Hussein Khuddayer al­Sammaraei, as saying it was "unnecessary" for allied troops to protect the refugees because

"That activity wasn't around ten years ago," added Webster. "It was just beginning to take place, reminding that nations can cooperate on important is­sues such as this and that the intelligence communities can work with each other to try to make this a safer and better world." 
Webster said that good intel­ligence allowed the allies to "develop the modus operandi" of Saddam Hussein and prevent many incidents of terrorism. 
"I'm amused when people talk about how we overestimated the terrorist threat," said Webster, "but we know what we did to keep the terrorist incidents from taking place." 
Enforcement of sanctions against Iraq also required the support of the world's intelli­gence communities, he said. Sanctions were "only important if we could make sure they continued," Webster said, "and in that respect intelligence played an important role."

Iraq had agreed to cooperate with U.N. relief efforts for the Kurds. 
But U.S. officials said they didn't expect Iraq to interfere with the foreign troops. If Baghdad wants U.N. permission to sell nearly $1 billion in oil to buy emergency food and other supplies, it will have to cooperate with the Kurdish re­lief, the officials said. 
Even as helicopter-born troops crossed Iraq's northern frontier for the first time, U.S. forces completed their with­drawal from all of southern Iraq except a narrow zone bor­dering Kuwait. The remaining 18,000 troops will protect and feed refugees until effective al­ternatives are found, the U.S.

"We want immediate negotia­tions with core members of SUFR and the administration," said Manuel Espino, junior. "We chose to stage the sit-in in the Registrar's office because it is more visible ... Monk's (Malloy's) office on the third floor would not be as visible."

The sit-in was planned as a peaceful event to impress upon Malloy the group's desire to meet with him. "We are in no way trying to incite any vio­lence," said Michele Cage, ju­nior. "We don't think that ask­ing for a meeting with Malloy during regular office hours is too much to ask." 
Espino said that he believes the University has made progress in cultural diversity, but that the progress has come "very slowly." 
"They have to make cultural diversity a priority," added Azikwe Chandler, sophomore. 
Kenneth Durgans, director of Minority Student Affairs, de­clined to comment on the sit-in. 
According to Joe Wilson, stu­dent senator and SUFH mem­ber, the students are dissatis­fied with the commitment made by the University to address their original demands, issued Jan. 21.

•Why can't someone get some food on this campus after 1:00 am? It only makes sense for the Oak Room or the Huddle to be open past one. Most college students, myself in­cluded, stay up past one o'clock. And some of us happen to get hungry after these venerable institutions have closed and have to resort to stealing our roommate's car (which he doesn't let any of us drive) while he's sound asleep and going to Azar's. Hey, University Food Services, get on the ball and keep a place to get food open a little later.

While on the issue offood on this campus, why do the dining halls find it so difficult to keep certain items, like yogurt for example, cold? Personally, I don't particularly enjoy warm yogurt, and an informal survey of others up here at The Observer found that absolutely no one likes their yogurt warm. And really, how difficult can it be to keep yogurt cold? 

•Being 
a Philadelphia native maybe I'm a little biased, but these balls of grease the dining halls try to pass off as "Philly Cheesesteaks" just make my stomach turn. If 


only I could take these heathens to Pat's Steaks on South Street in Philadelphia, maybe I could convert them to my way of thinking. Until then, I'm doomed to turn my head in disgust whenever they serve those damn things.

know I should expect this, being so close to Chicago, but boy am I getting real tired of Chicago sports teams. with the exception of the White Sox. The Sox are probably the only team in town that true sports fans in the city enjoy. It seems most of the rest of the teams (CUBS) get fans because it's the trendy thing to do. And now, if the Sox keep doing well, they're going to attract a bandwagon. I fear for Chicago.

WORLD ANC rebuffs call conference a 'ploy' 
•JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -Black leader Nelson Mandela rejected government plans Wednesday for a conference on township violence, saying it was a ploy to win international support for President de Klerk. The African National Congress leader said his 

organization would not take part in the conference. But the rival Inkatha Freedom Party wel­comed the idea. Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said earlier the government planned to bring all affected parties together in a bid to end township clashes that have killed thousands of people since the mid-1980s. In the same statement, he said the ANC appeared to be the catalyst "in every case" of violence this year. It was the latest salvo in an escalating conflict with the ANC, which has threatened to suspend groundbreaking talks with the government unless it brings peace to the townships.

Holy Cross Sisters to be honored in May 
Special to The Observer 

The Congregation of the Sis­ters of the Holy Cross will be honored for its 150-year eornmilrnent to the li11ld of edu­cation in a speeial presentation during eommeneement exer­dsns at Saint Mary's May 18. 
Sister M. Thomas More, prnsidnnt of the congregation, will aecnpt the honor, titled the MonHlU Award, named after Fathnr Basil Anthony Moreau, the founder of the Holy Cross congregation. 
The award, which will be pre­sentnd for the first and only timfl at the commencement, has beHn creatHd in commemora­tion of the sp,squicentHnnial of the eongr11gation, which will be celebrated this summer. 
"As the Sisters of the Holy Cross cel11brate 150 years as a congregation. it is fitting and appropriate that Saint Mary's, as the direct beneficiary of the sist11rs' educational mission, aeknowledg11 and praise the sis­ters endeavors during the last century-and-a-half," said Saint 
Mary's  President  William  
lliekny.  
"This  college  has  been  

inevitably and perpetually en­riehnd by the commitment of tlw sisters to the education of wonwn. and we, as a college eommunity, extfmd our deepnst gratitude and heartiest con­gratulations to the sisters for a job well done," Hickey said. 
Father Moreau originally sent four Holy Cross sisters to northern Indiana in the mid­1800s to take care of domestic, nursing and sacristy needs of the mission that Father Edward Sorin had established at what is now Notre Dame. 
Seeing a need to educate the area's childrnn at a time when public schools were limited and often excluded females, the sis­ters opened their first school in Bertrand, Mich., a few miles north of the present-day Saint Mary's campus. 
In 1855 the school, which by then was known as Saint Mary's Academy, moved to Indiana, to the land along a plateau overlooking the St. Joseph River. 
That same year. the sisters received a charter from the state of Indiana for the estab­lishment of a school for the ed­ucation of ladies in the arts and sciences. The aeademy officially became known as Saint Mary's College in 1903. 
At one time, the congregation operated several high schools and colleges for young women. The trend toward coeducation has reduced the number to one high school. The Academy of the Holy Cross in Kensington, Md., and one college, Saint Mary's.

Bush pledges to push U.S. allies for help to Nicaragua 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Presi­dent Bush on Wednesday promised to press U.S. allies to help Nicaragua clear its $365 million in overdue debt pay­ments while welcoming Presi­dent Violeta Chamorro to the White House as a "leader of reconciliation." 
On the first state visit of a Nicaraguan president to the United States in 52 years, Bush told Chamorro he would urge other countries, including Japan, to give Nicaragua money so it can clear its overdue payments to the World Bank and the International De­velopment Bank on a foreign debt totaling $9.5 billion, said Assistant Secretary of State Bernard Aronson. 
The United States is con­tributing $50 million to the ef­fort, part of the $541 million the United States has ear­marked for Nicaragua since Chamorro's inauguration a year ago, said Aronson. 
He said Chamorro, in her Oval Office visit with Bush, pre­sented as her most pressing is­sue the need to wipe out the back payments that are making it difficult for her hard-pressed nation to get capital to fund national recovery efforts. 
Aronson quoted Bush as telling Chamorro, "One way or another we will do it." 
"The president pledged strong and firm United States assistance to Nicaragua and made it clear that the United states, along with the World Bank, will lead an international effort ... to help," Aronson told reporters after the meeting. 
Bush warmly welcomed the president of the Central Ameri­can nation that before her election was wracked by a civil war that cost 20,000 lives. 
Bush recalled her inaugura­tion last year following demo­cratic elections that ended more a decade of Marxist rule and the war in which the United States backed anti­government Contra rebels. 
"On that Inauguration day, we saw Dona Violeta, candidate of compassion, become President Chamorro, leader of rec­onciliation," Bush said in wel­coming remarks on the White House south lawn. 
"You've begun to bring life and dreams back to your peo­ple," Bush said. 
"The tasks facing the Nicaraguan people are diffi­cult," he said. "Your economic stabilization plan requires hard choices. Economic reform after years of mismanagement is never easy and presents chal­lenges to leadership." 
But Bush mostly focused on Chamorro's efforts to restore democratic systems in Nicaragua rather than the eco­nomic ravages and lingering mistrust that still divides the Nicaraguans. 
Festering resentments flared anew with the assassination in February of Enrique Bermudez, the former commander in chief of the Contra rebels. 
Aronson said the United States, in response to a request from Nicaragua, would provide "technical assistance" to help with the investigation of that assassination. 
A day after telling Congress that she wants a sustained U.S. commitment to her country's reconstruction, Chamorro said at the White House on Wednes­day that U.S. aid "was a deci­sive factor during my first year in office .

SUFR 
continued from page 1 
They added to their demands a statement regarding the ra­cial harassment policy that was passed Monday evening by the Academic Council. SUFR stated that the policy is "unacceptable" and demand a policy "which offers a better definition of harassment, a cen­tral department in which dis­criminatory issues are handled, as well as, concrete fines and punishment for offenders." 
Wilson called the policy "vague" and said that SUFR demands a policy that is "more specific and concrete ... for pro­cedure and documentation." 
Beyond their specific de­
mands, SUFR expressed an un­derlying frustration at the Uni­versity's failure to communicate its efforts to address the issue of cultural diversity. ''I'm not going to say that the University is not committed to some of these issues," said Fred Tombar, 1990-91 student body vice president, "but communication is vital." 
According to Cage, the group desires Malloy to take a stance on SUFR, "one way or the other." 
"People are here because they don't know where Father Mal­loy stands on these issues," Tombar said. All SUFR wants, according to Tombar, is for Malloy to make a "public statement of commitment to look into these issues." 

Tombar said that an example of this would be Malloy issuing a statement that he has formed a committee to examine the possibility of building a multi­cultural center. 
The sit-in occurred just one day before Spring Visitation weekend for minority students was scheduled to begin. SUFR members expressed concern that their dissatisfaction with ND will be passed on to future ethnic students. "They are try­ing to bring minorities here when the ones who are here aren't happy," said Keith Mc­Coy, senior. 
Wilson called the coincidence of the sit-in and the weekend, "good timing." 
Laura Brown, a student coor­dinator for the weekend, said she does not feel the sit-in will adversely affect the visitation. 
"We're just hoping that the students who feel the University is not responding to their needs speak honestly with the visiting students," she said. 
Registrar's office shut down 
The Registrar's office was virtually shut down by the demonstrators. according to employees. "We're here to serve the students, and they're ob­structing us," said one em­ployee, "We can't get any work done." 
"They're too loud, and people cannot get in and out of the of­fice," the employee added. 
Students were unable to use the Direct Access Registration by Telephone (DART) terminals to register. At 1 p.m.. one hour after DART opens, the employ­ees had already turned away eight students who had come to the office to DART. 

Throughout the day, Notre Dame Security was on hand to monitor the events. "We're standing by to make sure that nobody gets hurt," said Rex Rakow, director. 
Rakow said that the sit-in was not staged according to duLac, which requires demonstrators to seek permission to demonstrate from the admin­istration. "It's an illegal demonstration," he said. 
He added that Security could have removed the students from the premises at the beginning of

both used in this capacity, he said. "We tracked every one of Saddam's ships anywhere in the world." 
Intelligence also helped the President and other leaders de­cide on the appropriateness of military force early on in the conflict. 
"It was the uniform assess­ment of the entire intelligence community," he said, "that sanctions alone would not cause Saddam Hussein to leave Kuwait." 
He added that "although we were destroying his (Saddam's) economy, the military would only be affected marginally." 
Intelligence also identified the locations of chemical plants. nuclear reactors, bunkers, fa­cilities and infrastructure. Webster said much of this was based on the CIA's "encyclopedic knowledge of the hot spots of the world" that has accumulated over many years. 
"SMART weapons made the difference in this war," he said, "but they were only smart in the sense that someone had to tell them where to go ... a function of intelligence." 
As to whether the CIA knew of Iraq's invasion before hand, Webster said "we had indica­tors that said 'he's ready to go'" within 12 to 24 hours, just prior to the invasion. 
Webster said the CIA is now in the process of "second­guessing ourselves ... asking how we could do it better if we ever had to do it again." He added that General Norman Schwartzkopf has told him that the Gulf War was the "best in­formed war that was ever fought" but that some informa­tion could have been provided "better or sooner." 
"As we emerge from the Gulf War" he said, "the United States is in a stronger position to foster greater international cooperation in confronting the global issues, particularly weapons proliferation." 
Webster warned of the spread of so-called "weapons of mass destruction" saying "all will be attainable within time unless international efforts to stop this (proliferation) ... are taken." 
On other issues, Webster dis­cussed recent developments within the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's instability "could have a significant impact on our own national security," he said. 
He added that "while our re­lations with the Soviet Union have come a long way, we must not lose sight of the fact that the Soviet Union is now facing severe international problems." Webster said that as interna­tional pressures mount, it will be exceedingly difficult to re­solve competing forces. 

As to the internal conflicts between the republics of the Soviet Union and the central government, Webster said "it remains to be seen how much room there is for compromise between the government and those pressing for greater freedom." 
"He (Gorbachev) appears to realize," said Webster, "that a return to the techniques of massive repression and force will only lead to a larger cycle of violence and instability." 
These internal Soviet devel­opments will have a "ripple ef­fect" on Eastern Europe in the form of a "flood of immigra­tion," he added. He said some Eastern European leaders pre­dict as many as four million refugees from the Soviet Union will enter their countries in the next few years. 
He also said that "the demo­cratic prospects (in Eastern Europe) look far better than anyone would have ever imag­ined a few years ago." He added that their success depends upon how well the countries learn from each other. 
"The longer the tough deci­sions are postponed," he said, "the harder it will be to over­come decades of communist mismanagement." 
"It's important that the breakthroughs of the 1980's don't become the breakdowns of the 1990's" said Webster. 
Responding to a question concerning the extent of the CIA's covert activities, Webster, who became the director of the CIA in 1987. said that the CIA spends only three percent of its resources on covert activities and only by request of the President. However he said that these activities account for "97 percent of the grief and suspi­cion of intelligence." 
"One of things we do not do" he said, "is assassination ... we cannot (by executive order) intentionally set out to cause the death of a public figure." 
Before becoming the director of the CIA, Webster enjoyed a thirty-year career as an attor­ney and judge of various federal courts. 
He then became director of the Federal Bureau of Investi­gation in 1978 until taking over the CIA in 1987. 

Baker wants Europe in peace plan 
LUXEMBOURG (AP) -Secre­tary of State James Baker III on Wednesday said West European nations should play a role in the Mideast peace process and promised to prod Israel to go along. 
"We would like to see the ap­proach be one of including rather than excluding," Baker said after meeting foreign min­isters of the European Com­munity, the 12 nation-trading bloc. 
But he also said the United States wanted a peace drive "that has some reasonable chance of success." 
Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jacques Poos told a joint news conference the Community "feels it should be associated" with the peace process. But neither he or Baker would spell out what role the Europeans might have.

Also charged in Ms. Helm­chen's death were Miller's step­son, William Harmon, 20, and a friend of Harmon, Rodney Wood, 16, both of LaPorte. 
Wood testified against Miller in a plea bargain in which prosecutors dropped a death penalty charge. He agreed to plead guilty to murder and ac­cept a 60-year sentence. 
Wood said Miller planned the crime, enlisting him and Har­mon, and selected the victim and the secluded construction site where Ms. Helmchen was slain. 
Wood said he and Harmon abducted Ms. llelmchen from a Valparaiso White Hen Pantry and drove her to the site. The two younger men raped her at MillAr's instruction and Harmon sodomized her with a tire iron, Wood testified. 
Wood said Harmon killed her with a shotgun blast to the head.

Georgetown student apologizes for uproar caused by racial commentary 
WASHINGTON (AP) -A Ge­orgetown University Law stu­dent apologized Wednesday for the uproar caused by a com­mentary he wrote contending that black students at the school are less qualified than whites. 
"1 wanted people to notice the article, but as we all see, far too many people noticed for the good of myself and the good of the law center," said Timothy Maguire, a third-year law stu­dent. 
"One reason for this (turmoil) was my terribly ill-chosen words and terribly unfair exaggeration," he said. "I am very sorry about using terms like 'Admissions Apartheid.'" 
Maguire wrote in the weekly law school newspaper that the academic credentials of white and black students accepted at Georgetown were "dramatically unequal." 
The commentary, which ap­peared under the headline "Admissions Apartheid," cited a "random sample" of test scores and grade-point averages, which Maguire said he obtained while working as an admissions clerk. 
Maguire said he found that "75 out of 97 black applicants had Law School Admissions Test scores of below 35 (out of 50), as opposed to less than one-sixth of white applicants."

page 6 SUFR DEMONSTRATION April 18,1991 
SUFR holds press conference 
By PAUL PEARSON Associate News Editor 
In a press conference Wednesday at 11 a.m., mem­bers of Students United for Respect (SUFR) announced they were staging a sit-in in the Notre Dame Registrar's Office. 
Reading from a prepared statement by SUFR, Beatriz Cruz, senior, said that the group would remain in the Administration Building until they could hold "immediate ne­gotiations" with University President Father Edward Mal­Joy on SUFR's demands. 
These demands include the building of a multi-cultural center and the hiring of two assistants to the Director of 
SUFR 
continued from page 4 
the sit-in. 
After a morning of Student Government's efforts to secure dialogue between the students and the administration, a seven-student committee of concerned students was formed. 
The committee was able to meet privately with Malloy around 2 p.m. in the Sorin Chapel. The following students are on the committee: Wilson, Fred Tombar, Yolanda Knight, Steve Bynum, Manuel Espino, Beatriz Cruz, and Corey Collins. 
This meeting, however, proved "very unproductive," according to Wilson. "We thought the main thing was communication... but he refused to openly say how the University was dealing with the issues." 
According to Denny Moore, director of Public Relations and Information, the official position of the University cannot be changed because SUFR is not a recognized organization. 
Malloy has never met with SUFR "because they have never agreed to apply for organizational status," according to Moore. 
"It's been my understanding that there's no reason why they (SUFR) could not get official status if they applied for it," he added. 
Moore said that Malloy be­lieves the meetings between Patricia O'Hara, vice president of Student Affairs, and the Stu­dent Government committee which prepared "The Challenge of Diversity" report for the Board of Trustees "are a perfectly good way to address the issues." 
Wilson said he does not be­lieve the meetings with O'Hara and other administrators have been effective because the stu­dent government committee "doesn't have the right to as­sume the responsibility to speak for SUFR." 
"The committee and SUFR are two different entities," he said. 
Moore also said that Malloy has met informally with indi­viduals and small groups of students that are a part of SUFR, which Moore believes has shown them "that he's (Malloy's) interested in the is­sues they've raised." 
Wilson said that SUFR is not interested in becoming a recognized organization. "We are a group of concerned students and want to be looked upon as such." 
Minority Student Affairs. 
"It's a shame that it had to come to this," Cruz said, "but the deliberate denial of our rights must be addressed." 
Cruz said that the decision to hold a sit-in was made in light of recent events which, she said, displays the University's insensitivity to SUFR's position. 
As an example, Cruz cited the April Fool's Day edition of The Observer, which included a photograph of a white police officer using a choke hold on a black man. 
The photograph, Cruz said, "shows the ignorance that per­vades the University," especially in light of recent events such as the beating of a black man by six Los Angeles police officers last month. 
"The bottom line is that we've challenged the University," Wilson said. "We've called them to take a stance." 
7 p.m. deadline is set 
The demonstrators were given a 7 p.m. deadline to leave the building, and said they were told they would be suspended if they remained. 
According to Sister Jean Lenz, assistant vice president for student affairs, students who remained in a University building after hours could have been asked to leave by Security. 
If they refused to leave, Security could have taken their names to give to University of­ficials, who would have then decided whether to pursue fur­ther disciplinary action. 
According to Moore, there was no official University statement issued about the possibility of suspension. 
Choosing to abide by the deadline, members of SUFR packed up their belongings and left the Administration building on their own accord minutes after 7 p.m. 
Members of SUFR met twice behind closed doors in the hour before the deadline to discuss how they would respond once the deadline arrived. The first meeting to discuss the group's options yielded no decisions. 
Father Richard Warner, counselor to the president and Roland Smith, executive assis­tant to the president, were in­cluded in the second meeting to discuss the University's posi­tion and the possible outcomes of SUFR's actions should they have decided to remain in the building past the deadline. 
Warner and Smith then left the office so that the students could make a final decision. 
Minutes after 7 p.m., mem­bers of SUFR emerged from the office with all of their belongings and proceeded to leave the building. At that time, some members of SUFR issued a statement to the press concerning their decision to end the sit-in. 
SUFR member Collins sum­marized the day's events, say­ing that they had come to the conclusion to end the sit-in, but that members of SUFR would meet with Malloy at 
12:30 a.m. today in his room in Sorin Hall. 
"What we hope is to get satisfaction of our demands," said Collins, referring to the set of 10 demands SUFR is making. 
Explaining the demand for an ethnic course requirement, Tombar said that there is an increasingly ethnic population across the country and that an ethnic course requirement 

Cruz said that Malloy had of­fered to meet with members of the Notre Dame branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) after midnight Wednesday night in his room in Sorin Hall. 
The offer, according to Cruz, was turned down. "We will not hold some clandestine meeting with him in the middle of the night." 
Cruz said that SUFR is disap­pointed in Malloy's apparent lack of interest in its demands, saying that if Malloy was truly concerned, "he would push for research," of how other universities have handled minority concerns such as multicultural centers and racial harassment policies. 
would only reflect the changing social profile of the country. 
"Two years ago tlie Univer­sity dedicated a year to the is­sue of cultural diversity," said Tombar. "They claim to have a commitment to ethnic diver­sity ... but we still only have a one-percent ethnic faculty." 
Tombar said that ethnic is­sues have been protested at Notre Dame since 1968, but that little has been accom­plished to make the campus truly diverse. "We recognize that the University is (sensitive) to these issues... What we want is communication and action." 
During the statement by Collins and Tombar, other SUFR members also said that their First Amendment Rights were being violated by the fact that duLac says that students may not conduct protests with­out first receiving permission from the University. 
The section in duLac concerning demonstrations states: "All demonstrations must be registered with the Associate Vice President for Residence Life and also must observe the following rules: 
• 
All demonstrations must be peaceful and orderly 

• 
Only members of the Uni­versity community may orga­nize or lead a demonstration on campus. 

• 
Demonstrators may not im­pede the freedom of the University community (duLac, 53). 


Tombar said that the sit-in had been in the planning stages for some time, and that one of the reasons SUFR chose to end the sit-in when it did was that SUFR wanted to "have business dealt with in the hours in which business should be conducted." 
Although they left the build­ing, the issues raised by the sit-in are far from over and SUFR members gathered afterward in small groups discussing the sit-in and future plans. 
"Eventually, what's going to come out of this whole thing is good," said Student Body Pres­ident Joseph Blanco. "I think communication between the administration and student body will be enhanced." 
Dave Florenzo, student body vice president, added that he was happy the sit-in ended on a positive note. "We're just really pleased that no one is going to be suspended," he concluded.

SUFR DEMONSTRATION
Thursdsay, April 18, 1991 page 7 
.,~ 
The Observer/ John O'Brien Fred Tombar, 1990-91 student body vice president, senior Corey Collins, and other members of Students United for Respect (SUFR) talk with members of the television press Wednesday evening at the Administration Building, stating the purpose of their sit-in and a few of SUFR's demands. 
Professor: University should listen to the concerns of SUFR 


The following is the text of the DISCRIMINATORY HARASSMENT POLICY which was passed by the Academic Council on Tuesday, April 16. 
1. POLICY: 
The University of Notre Dame believes in the intrinsic value of all human beings. It is, moreover, committed to the full peaceable participation of all its members in the educational endeavor it fosters. This is the reason that the University prohibits discriminatory harassment as defined below. The University is also committed to the free expression and ad­vocacy of ideas; it wishes to maintain the integrity of this commitment as well. For this reason. cases of verbal ha­rassment are defined here with great caution. Harassment in general is prohibited elsewhere in the University's regulations. 
2. DEFINITION: 
For purposes of this policy: 
a. Harassment. Harassment is any physical conduct inten­tionally inflicting injury on the person or property of another, or 
any intentional threat of such conduct, or 
any hostile, intentional, and persistent badgering, addressed directly at another, or small group of others, which is intended to intimidate its victim(s) from any university activity, or 
any verbal attack, intended to provoke the victim to immediate physical retaliation. 
b. Discriminatory Harassment. Conduct as described in a., above, constitutes discriminatory harassment, if, in addition. it is accompanied by intentionally demeaning expressions concerning the race, sex, religion. sexual orientation, or national origin of the victim(s). 
3. PROHIBITION: 
All discriminatory harassment is prohibited. 
4. ADMINISTRATION: 
It is appropriate to report any incident of discriminatory harassment to the authorities of the university. The ways available for doing this are as follows. 
Students: A case of harassment by a student toward another student which occurs outside a residence hall is to be reported to the Office of Residence Life and shall be handled in the same manner as other violations of University rules and regulations. (see du Lac: Student Life Policies and Procedures; University Standards of Behavior.) 
Likewise, any incident of discriminatory harassment by a student toward a faculty member or staff member is to be reported to the Office of Residence Life. Any incident of dis­criminatory harassment by a student toward any other student which occurs in a residence hall is to be reported first to the rector and, in consultation with the Office of Residence Life, a determination shall be made as to whether the incident should be handled at the hall level or whether the matter should be referred to the Office of Residence Life. 
Faculty: An incident of discriminatory harassment by a faculty member is to be reported to the chair of the academic department, or, in cases involving the chair, to the dean of the college. If the matter cannot be resolved at the department or college level, it is to be referred to the Provost's office. 
Staff: An incident of discriminatory harassment by a staff member is to be reported to the the Director of Human Resources, and shall be handled by the Human Resources Office in the same manner as any other violation of University Rules and Regulations as outlined in the University Human Resources Manual. 
Administration: An incident of discriminatory harassment by an administrator is to be reported to the appropriate superior officer of the person involved. 
Ombudsperson: Notwithstanding the above. a person alleging discriminatory harassment may choose to report the incident to the University Ombudsperson. This is to be a member of the university community, selected by the president for that task. The ombudsperson, after taking information on the incident, is to help the complainant handle the matter, either by informal conciliation, or by helping the complainant proceed with the reporting procedure described above . 
5. EXISTING UNIVERSITY RULES AND REGULATIONS: 
This policy is intended to be an addition to existing University rules and regulations and does not alter or modify any existing University rule or regulation. 
The Observer/Eric Bailey Members of Students United for Respect (SUFR) hold up signs during their sit-in at the Administration Building on Wednesday. Their demands of talking with Father Malloy at this time were not fulfilled. 
By DANNIKA SIMPSON News Writer 
.John Knnrwdy . .Jr., a profes­sor in thn Computing Depart­IIIPnt said the University should listPn to the concerns of mnmhers of Students United For HPspect (SUFIH and at­lPmpt to negotiate with them. 

Kenrwdy, orw of sevnral pro­fessors who n~cently wrote a IPttPr to The Observer address­ing the issues of racism and cultural div1~rsity at the UnivNsity, said that he would like to sell the University lake "dear. strong, visible stPps" to show thP eommunity that it is committml to cultural diversity. 
"From the outside, it seems to me that SUFH is asking that the University do what they (The University) are saying they want to do," Kennedy said. lie is referring to the University's commitment to bring cultural diversity to the campus. 
lie said that the members of SUFH do not feel welcome at the University and that whether or not the University is aware of this, Notre Dame is telling the students that they are not welcome here. 
Kennedy said it appears that the members of SUFR are say­ing. '"Please make it clear that we are (welcome). Please take us seriously.'" 
lie also criticized the Univer­sity for not handling the issue publicly. 
lie said, "They (SUFR) are handling it publicly, the University is not. I don't know what the University is doing." 
Kennedy also said people do not want to think that the ad­ministration is "closed minded and vindictive," as its lack of action is suggesting. He said, "You don't want to think the worst of the University." 
He also said he hopes Malloy will take the opportunity to lis­ten to SUFR and negotiate with the group. He says this will help to educate the students. 
"I hope that Father Malloy understands this is an oppor­tunity to teach. In order to re­ally teach someone, you have to listen. In order to educate, he's going to have to listen," he said. 
Kennedy stressed that he is speaking only for himself and is not a representative of the other faculty members who signed the letter.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Environmental group's petition has misinformation 
Dear Editor: 
This letter is in response to the petition being circulated by Students for Environmental Ac­tion (SEA), which provides cer­tain misinformation and non­objective viewpoints related to oil exploration and drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). As a resident of the state of Alaska, employee of an oil corporation and visitor to ANWR. I can provide first hand knowledge of the oil industry and tundra environ­ment in question. Hopefully this letter will help conscientious students come to a greater, more open-minded conclusions about arctic development and the future of the American oil industry. 

r The national Energy Strategy, r the legislation addressed by the 
r­
SEA petition does not target the

r 
,.. entire 19 million acres of ANWR wilderness for oil explo­ration. The area which is being 
~ 
r considered (for exploration, not r full-blown development as of r yet) is only in fact 100 thousand 
,. 
acres and covers a relatively r small, desolate piece of coastal 
,. 
tundra in the north of the ,. gigantic national park. This 
r 
proposed area covers less than one-fourth of ANWR's coastal region, leaving undeveloped a major part of the arctic coast, and one of America's last untouched ecosystems. 
SEA believes that the effects of this sale (of the proposed area for oil development) would be tragic. The petition cites land decimation and endangering of Alaska's fishing industry as unavoidable side ef­fects of oil drilling in ANWR. Both fears are essentially un­founded: Bristol bay is noted as a priceless fishery endangered by arctic development, when the fishery lies 700 miles to the south-west. Eskimo whalers are the only "fishermen" in the vicinity of the ANWR coast, and 
r.o possible adversity is 

foreseeable for these people. Eskimo whalers have cooperated with oil drillers in other parts of the arctic for twenty years. The villagers of Kaktovik, the only Eskimo community in the area, favor development in their "backyard" 100 miles away due to the increased economic op­portunity for their young people and its tested minimal adversity to their home environment. 
The Gwich'in Indians live 250 miles to the south of the area targeted for drilling, and some of the villagers feel the migra­tion of the caribou herd on which they rely for food will be adversely effected by ANWR de­velopment. However, existing oil fields have tended not to de­crease the caribou population, but to foster its growth. The Central Arctic Herd has grown three-fold since arctic develop­ment began in the 70's. 
Some opponents to the oil in­dustry argue that this increase is due to elimination of their natural predators, namely wolves. Wolves instinctively avoid human activity, thus pre­serving the caribou who move peacefully throughout existing oil fields. The facts and specu­lation on this issue stand as they are, providing a complex environmental question for concerned citizens. 
Prudhoe (Prood-hoe) Bay is a 250,000 acre oil field adjacent to the ANWR site, having been in production for over twenty years. Environmental damage to the tundra and ecosystems of that region have been minimal, according to state, oil-industry, and independently funded research. The "Exxon Valdez' spill comes to most Americans' minds when environmental safety is suggested-pictures of petroleum soaked ducks, otters, etc. 
However, the Valdez spill happened in Valdez port, a vital link to the oil transportation process, but removed more than 600 miles to the south of the tundra regions where the actual drilling occurs. Oil pro­duction companies and state agencies on the North Slope of Alaska, with significant in­creases since the tragic dump­ing in Valdez, have response equipment and employed biol­ogist personnel ready for re­sponse to environmental dan­gers. 

Luckily, in Prudhoe Bay's twenty years, no serious oil spills have occurred. Still, de­fense systems continue to be developed and fine-tuned, at much cost for the oil compa­nies. at the insistence of gov­ernment permits. These per­mits, restrictions and stipula­tions placed on the developers, play a major role in maintain­ing a safe balance between technology and nature. 
Prudhoe Bay was permitted in 1968, when environmental is­sues were on the way back burner: very few restrictions, impact studies, and the like, were carried out before drilling was begun. This prototype arc­tic oil field has been a labora­tory for petroleum and envi­ronmental scientists since then. Mistakes were made and learned from in Prudhoe's his­tory, helpful in the permitting of Endicott oil field in 1977. With nearly twenty times the writing as the Prudhoe Bay catalog of restrictions, Endicott is "safer" with more consideration to the land on which it is built, and more accident-prevention mechanisms built into the oil field facilities. 

Perhaps the most encourag­ing aspect of Endicott's devel­opment is the limited land needed for surface drilling equipment; in Prudhoe Bay, the oil wellheads (where the oil comes out of the ground) are located 100 feet apart. At En­dicott, the well heads are only ten feet apart. The "footprint' on the land-tundra habitat de­stroyed by gravel foundations, potential interference with caribou migration patterns, etc.-was limited effectively through research and increas­ing stipulations during the ten years between development of Prudhoe Bay and Endicott. 
Advanced drilling technolo­gies in ANWR are expected to restrict land use even more, with more sophisticated acci­dent and spill prevention tech­niques. The existence of gov­ernment restrictions is vital to the growth of the oil industry and its place in society. Letters to Congressmen and women keep the healthy trend towards prevention and environmental concern alive and effective. 
At time of this writing, I do not have figures with which to compare SEA's estimates of ANWR's drilling potential. What I can say is that Prudhoe Bay, putting out 1.2 million barrels a day, today supplies 20 percent of the U.S. daily consumption of oil. A development in ANWR is expected to surpass the productivity of Prudhoe Bay. I have travelled to the coastal region with geologists who have pointed out oil-soaked sandstone on the surface. Exact findings of exploratory wells are "top-secret," but geologists and petroleum scientists have significant evidence that the coastal plain covers a huge oil reservoir. 
Also, over time Prudhoe Bay's estimated "recoverable" re­serves have increased yearly with development of "oil recov­ery systems' which make oil wells more efficient. Given time and the progress of drilling technology, the amount of oil accessible in ANWR may grow to provide more than 20 per­cent of US oil consumed. 

The petition cites a new natu­ral gas pipeline as part of the NES document. The 800 mile Trans-Alaska oil pipeline, car­rying petroleum from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez port, rests atop a rack on which a small natural gas pipeline could also rest. No further "dredging and blasting of the tundra" will be necessary because the damage has already been done for the exis­tent oil pipeline. However, and transport from Valdez to Seattle is being proposed in a joint US­Canada venture through the province of British Columbia. Such a pipeline would indeed create new environmental scars on that land. 
While Americans continue to consume such gross amounts of the world's fossil fuels, a domestic oil supply is in our best interest as a nation. Government funding for research of alternative energy sources finds nothing it considers "economical" for development. Personally, I find destruction or significant alteration of the environment to be a high cost for fossil fuel dependence. But the fact is that modern oil drilling in Alaska keeps these adversities to a bare minimum. 
In my forever undereducated and humble opinion, the effects on the land and its lifesystems is well controlled and quite harmless. The debate may soon boil down to aesthetics, and the fact that what is unattractive is not always un­safe. When environmental side-effects come under control, American energy self-reliance may be worth perturbing a few wealthy tourists who vacation in the Alaskan arctic.

Pro-choice presentation treated poorly by professor 
Dear Editor: 
With all the press lately in The Observer about the heroic actions of the Pro-Ufe activists, and they should be commended for their concern, I have to call your attention to an incident in a medical ethics class at this university on Thursday, April 4. I presented a paper on the mortality of abortion, a topic I was told to "do whatever I wanted" with by the instructor. 
After giving a brief history of the Catholic Church's wavering stance on the issue, and consid­ering the mutual concern for the physical health of the would-be mother shared by both the Pro-Life and Pro­Choice groups, I concluded that the mental health of an individ­ual can be as important as the physical health (i.e. physically healthy people commit suicide). Without going into further de­tail, I concluded in my presen­tation that I fell into the Pro­Choice group. 

Commenting on my presenta­tion, the professor, who hap­pens to be a priest, called my presentation "ridiculous" and " the craziest thing (he'd) ever heard" in front of the entire class. 
Regarding my opinion that America would rather spend tax dollars recovering oil fields in Kuwait than educate its teens on birth control, the same instructor made a negatively stereotypical remark associat­ing America's protection of the Jewish community Israel and the proliferation of abortion clinics in America. 
The embarrassment and humiliation I felt has not been equalled in my life. As a grad­uating senior and a member of a family that has been a part of Notre Dame for 33 years and two generations, I was shocked and dismayed at the lack of re­spect shown for my opinion, my academic freedom and the rights of minorities. An apology at this point would be useless since the damage has been done. Laws are based on morality and I don't think the Supreme Court of the United States would call my opinion "crazy." 
Regardless of a person's stand on the issue of abortion, they at this University, this instructor should not be condemned in an revealed himself to be truly academic setting that is academically unethical. supposed to promote spiritual Does this strike you as growth, as promised in my ac­ironic?! ceptance letter four years. ago.

Ya Gotta Regatta

Conw sail away ... 

The fifth annual Fisher llall Regatta sets sail..-.-......._~ Saturday, April 20 at noon on Saint Mary's Lake.-.-..'""" The regatta features competition between Notre Dam11 residence halls in assorted watercraft that rnsidents have built. 
Begun in 1987 by Fisher Hall resident Jayp...-.....owwo._.-.....~,_,.llt:ii~~;;;;....;o~::;;:::' Farraher, the regatta offers something for ev­
nryonn. The initial challenge begins with the construction of a "boat." Regatta regulations require that no conventional boats. including 
rowboats, sailboats or surfboards, be allowed to compet11 in the event. 
In addition, all vessels must be man-powered. Other than these and a few other preliminary ~~~~.;;;w.~~~~~O, rules, the only requirement is that the watercraft float. 
Traditionally a race to the finish line, the regatta ineludes a "most original entry" category for those halls with all of the creativity but little of the engineering it takes to win. In fact for many dorms, the race itself is actually no more than an attempt to reach the finish line-first or last. 
But that is not to say that the regatta is without sonw finrce competition. Victors in last year's race, Fisher and Lnwis flails will participate once again. St. Edward's and Cavanaugh are expected to n1turn to give them a run for their money. 
As co-chairperson for the regatta, Ted Stumpf llXplains, "We exp11ct a big contest between racing rivals Fisher and Cavanaugh. Howard and St. Ed's will also display their ongoing rivalry for the most original watercraft." 
The enthusiasm for the event is present on campus Hvnrywhere a T-shirt is found pro­daiming, "Ya Gutta Hegatta." 
In a race where no expHrience but the ability to swim (in case the boat should spring a leak) is necessary, the regatta will undoubtedly include all sorts of talents. And indeed, some of those with the least experience will probably provide the gn1atnst entertainment. 
lloly Cross field will be open for the event, with a campus picnic sponsored by University Food Services from 11:00 a.m. until 1:00 p.m. Hadio station WAOH will be broadcasting live. 

Thn prnliminary heats are set to begin at noon. Th11 snmi-linal and final heats will most likely take place around 2:00 p.m. 
Local and campus figures will be judging the racns. Lt. Sam Walsh of Crimestoppers and Sgt. Tim McCarthy are among those scheduled to atttmd. 
Thn winners of both the men's and women's hnats will carry home the Fisher Hall Hegatta Cup, a trophy to reside in the winning hall for the following year. But they will not be the only ones to carry home a regatta cup. Fisher Hall plans to give "regatta cups" to the first 1500 people who 
attnnd the event. 
All donations made by participating dorms will b11nnfit the Andre Houses of Hospitality, shelters that offer daily meals to the needy. Operated by th11 lloly Cross Brothers, the shelters are located in Phoenix, Arizona and Oakland, California. 
Aecording to Ed Keener, co-ehairperson for the event. basically the Fisher Hall

Irish softball takes two games from St. Joseph's 
By RENE FERRAN Associate Sports Editor 
As tlw WIHtther improves, Notre Dame softball coach Brian Boulac hopes his team's bats heat up as well. 
The Irish came into yester­day's doublP-header with St. .JosP.ph's (7-13) hitting a paltry .206 on the season. but their sweep of the Pumas 2-0, 8-2 could be just the cure Boulac has bmm looking for. 
"llopefully, these two games will be the catalyst for us to get on a roll," he said. "St. Joseph's might not be as strong a com­pntition as we've faced, but tlwy're a good, solid club." 
In the opener, Notre Dame (21-19) scored both its runs in the bottom of the second inning. Singles by Christy Connoyer and Amy Folsom put runners at the eorners with one out. After Connoyer seored on a wild piteh, and Kathy Vernetti's two­out single to left off losing pitcher Laura lleyne (6-2) brought home Folsom. 
And behind the pitching of Carrie Miller (4-5) and Missy Linn (first career save), that would be all the seoring the Irish would nned. The two com­binl~d on the second no-hitter of

the season for Notre Dame, striking out seven and not walking a St. Joseph's batter. Only two Irish errors cost them a perfect game. 
"Carrie had a rough outing yesterday, so it was good to see her get five good innings in," Boulac said. "Missy has been throwing well lately, and I brought her in because I wanted to secure the win and keep Carrie's confidence at a high level." 
In the nightcap, Boulac gave some of the regulars a game off, opting to start some of his youngsters off the bench. Sophomores Lisa Miller, Casey McMurray and Sheri Quinn, and freshmen Stephanie Pinter and Melissa Cook took advantage of their rare opportunity, scoring seven runs in the first three innings off Kristin Ruda (1-11) to break open the game early. 
"From the fall, I knew that (Huda) wasn't a strong pitcher, so we could use some of our younger players. They came out swinging the bat well, making some contact, and they kept us out in front," Boulac said. "We also ran the bases a lot better,

McCaffrey considers Stanford 
DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -Bill McCaffrey, the second-leading scorer Duke's NCAA champion basketball team, may decide this week whether to transfer to another school, his father said. 
McCaffrey was third on the team in minutes played (24.8), but his father said playing time is a factor in his discontent. 
"Billy is concerned, but he's always been concerned -all year," Ed McCaffrey Sr. said. "Playing time is part of that. So is getting the opportunity to handle the ball more, to play more point.. just to be a greater factor. He's been asked to fill the catalyst's role, and he has done that. 
"It's tough. What do you like to do? Are you happy in the role you need to play to fit into a program? Or do you want to go for it?" 
The Herald-Sun of Durham reported in Wednesday's edi­tions that Stanford has ·been suggested as a possible desti­nation. Ed McCaffrey Jr., a Stanford senior, recently com­pleted an All-American football career as a wide receiver. 
McCaffrey, a 6-foot-3 sopho­more guard from Allentown, Pa., averaged 11.6 points for the Blue Devils (32-7). He started 21 games this season, led Duke in free throw percent­age (.832) and scored 16 points against Kansas in the NCAA fi­nal. 
"Billy is assessing other op­portunities," McCaffrey Sr. said. "He hasn't decided on where he's going, but he is talking with his coaches. He's trying to bn honest and up front with the Duke coaches. Things should shake out in a day or so, maybe by Thursday." 
Neither McCaffrey nor Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski -in South Bend, Ind., for a speaking engagement -could be reached immediately for com­ment.

vs. Kansas) transfers? 
formation director for Duke, said the school would have a statement on the issue later Wednesday. 
"Billy likes Duke," his father said. "He has no criticism of anything about the place. It's a great school, great program, great coaching staff, great players. He just has to decide what's best for him. That may mean going to an environment that's better for him." 
If McCaffrey transferred, he would have to sit out one sea­son, then would have two sea­sons of eligibility remaining. 
Duke loses just two seniors, Greg Koubek and Clay Buckley, off its NCAA championship team. Next fall, the Blue Devils add post players Cherokee Parks and Erik Meek, as well as redshirt freshman guard Kenny Blakeney. 
McCaffrey's father hinted that the emergence of the Hills, swing players Thomas and Grant, has his son worried about his role next season. 
"Coach K likes to play four forwards and one guard," McCaffrey said. "Who's to say the guy is wrong? He's one of the top coaches in the country, and the truth of the matter is he just has a lot of great players. 
"But against Kansas, for in­stance, Duke needed two guards out there to handle the ball." 
"Billy has a lot of mixed emo­tions right now," McCaffrey Sr. said. "That's a very good envi­ronment that he's talking about possibly leaving. lie's my son and I love him. I'm trying to counsel him to make sure he's doing the right thing. But the final decision is his. I don't envy him." 
Gary Player set on winning his ninth major 
PALM BEACH GAHDENS, Fla. (AP) -Gary Player has a tar­get. 
"I won nine majors on the regular tour. I want to surpass that record on the Senior Tour," the little South African said Wednesday. "That's my goal." 
By his own count, Player has eight Senior Tour "majors," and needs a successful defense of his PGA Senior Championship this week to match his regular­tour collection of three Masters, three British Opens, two PGAs and the 1965 U.S. Open. 
In order to match his regular­tour total in the 52nd Senior PGA that begins Thursday, Player must overcome rivals .Jack Nicklaus, Lee Trevino and Arnold Palmer and a certain amount of skepticism. 
The problem is that no one is really sure just what constitutes ... a "major" title for the over-50 set. 
It's generally agreed that the Senior PGA, the oldest of the Senior Tour events, and the Senior Open would qualify. 
"I think we'd all say those two are majors," Nicklaus said. "I'm not sure about any others yet." 
Player, 55, has won three Senior PGA titlPs and two Senior U.S. Opens. lie also in­cludes, in his own personal list of senior "majors... the TPC (Player won it in 19H7) and the British Senior OpPn (Player won it twice).

---Bill Polian of Bills not Lou Holtz speaks SPORTS BRIEFS on Digger; says 
•Sports Briefs are accepted, in writing, at The Observer office 
worried to draft 26th 
on the third floor of LaFortune during business hours. All briefs
he was not forced 
NEW YORK (AP) -Bill Polian of the Buffalo Bills is happy to be choosing 26th in Sunday's NFL draft for at least one good reason. 
This year's NFL draft is full of excellent 26th choices; very few Nos. 1, 2 or 3. In fact, even the acknowledged No. 1 pick, Raghib "Rocket" Ismail of Notre Dame, has questions about him. 
It looks like a year where the strong will get stronger and the weak won't improve much. 
"We don't have any glaring weaknesses and this is a draft for teams that don't have glar­ing weaknesses," Polian says. "If you're looking for someone to come in and turn you around right away, that's another story." 
Tnat story starts at the top with Ismail, then continues with a group of talented players who have at least one question mark about. 
One of the top defensive line prospects, for example, is Eric Swann, who has played only semi-pro football for the Bay State Titans. He probably will be the first player without col­lege experience taken in the draft since Emil "Six Yard" Sitko was picked by the Rams in 1946, the year they moved from Cleveland to Los Angeles. 
Sitko chose Notre Dame in­stead, something that Swann isn't likely to do. 
But the questions go far be­yond Swann. 
Ismail, for example, is a unanimous choice for No. 1. Most of his college achieve­ments, however, were as a kick returner and some scouts ques­tion his durability at 175 pounds and his hands as a pass receiver. Overall, he is consid­ered a player who would have a greater impact with a winning team than with 1-15 New England, which chooses first overall. 
"All I know is that I'd love to have him," says Polian, whose Bills finished 13-3, won the AFC championship and lost the Super Bowl 20-19 to the Giants by the seven feet that Scott Norwood's field goal was wide right. 
Beyond that? 
The consensus is that the rest of the draft is filled with players who would be in the bottom half of the first round in most years -in part because of the eight underclassmen who were taken in the first round last year. 
Two juniors, Mark Carrier of the Bears and Emmitt Smith of the Cowboys, became rookies of the year. Jeff George of the Colts, Rodney Hampton of the Giants and Rob Moore of the Jets all flashed the potential of future stars. 
This year's other top players all have a rap against them, perhaps because of the lengthy pre-draft analysis to which they are subjected. 
They are either too light (Ismail; 265-pound Miami de­fensive tackle Russell Maryland; 175-pound Notre Dame cornerback Todd Lyght); too short (Notre Dame's 5-11 nose tackle Chris Zorich); a quarter­step too slow (Iowa running back Nick Bell); not mobile enough (San Diego State quar­terback Dan McGwire); too in­experienced (Swann); have less­than-thrilling work habits (Tennessee tackle Antone Davis) or off-field problems (Southern California quarterback Todd Marinovich.) 
"I hear that every year," says agent Leigh Steinberg, who represents Maryland and McGwire, among others. "Yet 

• 
every draft produces All-Pros or surprises who go lower than they should. I don't see any dif­ference in the talent." 
Steinberg isn't the only one. 

"It's only in the names," says Dallas coach Jimmy Johnson, who has three first-round picks, courtesy of the Herschel Walker and Steve Walsh trades. 
"The name guys came out last year. This year you've got guys you may not have heard of. But the talent is just as good." 
Who else is good? 

Lyght, Croel, Maryland and Davis should all be in the top ten, along with Davis' bookend tackle at Tennessee, Charles McCrae. Swann might fit in there if someone is willing to take a chance. 
The draft is deepest in re­ceivers, led by Ismail but also including Miami's Randal Hill, Virginia's Herman Moore and Tennessee's Alvin Harper. 
Brett Favre of Southern Mississippi is considered the best quarterback prospect, fol­lowed by McGwire, Louisville's Browning Nagle and (perhaps) Marinovich, who has played only two college seasons and is undergoing rehabilitation after being arrested after the season on drug charges. 
But it's probably, as Polian notes, better for the teams that pick later. 
"It's a trickle-down draft," says George Young of the Giants, who pick 27th and last in the first round-the Jets are without a pick because they took Moore in the supplemental draft last year. "I figure some­one decent will trickle down to us." 
HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C. (AP) -Notre Dame football coach Lou Holtz is convinced Digger Phelps was not forced to quit as the university's bas­ketball coach. 
In fact, Holtz said Phelps had advised him in the past to do just what Phelps did Monday. 
"He told me on several occa­sions that I was foolish to con­tinue to coach after we won the national championship" Holtz said Wednesday before playing in the Heritage Classic pro-am. 
"He said, 'Man, you ought to retire and get on to other things in your life.' I think there was a lot of things that Digger wanted to do with his life." 
Holtz said he believed Phelps left of his "own free will." 
"Here's a guy who's been there 20 years. You're going to have to retire sooner or later," Holtz said. "He chose when. 
"If you (the school) were go­ing to make a change, you'd do it before signing date.... I'm perfectly convinced that it was Digger's decision completely." 
Holtz also said nothing should be read into the fact Phelps' immediate bosses did not attend his news conference announcing his retirement. 
"I would think . . . they would have been there had the sched­ule been such," Holtz said. "I think when Digger makes a de­cision to go it's not necessary to be there." 
Holtz said he was attending an alumni function in Baltimore and could not attend Phelps' announcement either. But Holtz was quick to point out he wasn't missing any time with his team to play golf.

Men's tennis wins 6-0 over Michigan in home finale 
By JENNIFER MARTEN 
Sports Writer 
One step down and two to go. 
The Notre Dame men's tennis team moved one step closer to the NCAA tournament on Wednesday with a sweep of Michigan. The 6-0 victory left only Wisconsin and Ball State remaining as the only obstacles to an NCAA invitation. 
Yesterday's competition was the last home match of the sea­son and Notre Dame coach Bob Bayliss praised the seniors on the squad, Paul Odland, Ryan Wenger, and Tim Kalbas, before play began. "It has been a fun four years. Each of the seniors contributed tremendously to our achievements and we'll re­member them always," re­marked Bayliss. 
Once the match began how­ever, the other classes stole the show. At number-one singles, Notre Dame junior David DiLucia defeated Michigan's David Kass in a tough three­setter. 
DiLucia jumped out to an early lead winning the first set 6-1. In the second set, Kass turned his tennis up a notch and evened up the score with a 6-3 win. DiLucia took control again in the third set and skill­fully turned away Kass 6-2. 
"I played solid in the first and third sets and took advantage of opportunities," said DiLucia of his victory. 
Trouble erupted at number­two singles over a questionable call in the second set. Sophomore Chuck Coleman won the first set against Michigan freshman Dan Brakus 6-2 and was on the verge of winning the second set when Brakus called his shot out, forcing a tie­breaker. Coleman was angry with the call and he answered it with a 7-6 victory in the set. 
At number-three singles, Will Forsyth won his match with Wolverine sophomore Scott Cuppett in straight sets, 6-3, 6­
2. Sophomore Mark Schmidt faired as well at number-four singles beating John Karzen 6­3, 6-3. 
Another questionable call caused problems at number-five singles when the judge ruled in the second set that one of Notre Dame sophomore Andy Zurcher's returns was in. His opponent, Mitch Rubenstein, was infuriated by the call and he lashed out at the judge. Zurcher remained poised and won the match 6-3, 7-6. 

"There was a lot of finger pointing and name calling to­day. We didn't get into it too much and managed to remain poised," said Bayliss. 
The most exciting match of the evening was at number-six singles. Notre Dame sophomore Ron Rosas overcame a deficit to win the first set 7-6 against John Lingon. Behind 4-1, Rosas settled down and won three points to get back into the set. The second set was just as close with Lingon winning 6-7. Rosas took the decisive third set against Lingon, 6-0. 
Bayliss assessed Rosas' play. "He allowed Lingon to keep him deep in the court at the start. He got more aggressive and brought himself back," said Bayliss 
Doubles matches were sus­pended by mutual consent. 
Lacrosse defeats Wooster 13-7 
By MIKE SCRUDATO 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame lacrosse team continued its roller coaster season on Tuesday by bouncing back from last week­end's 10-3 defeat at the hands of Cornell with a 13-7 triumph over Division III powerhouse Wooster at Carl Dale Memorial Field in Wooster, Ohio. 
"This has been a strange year," Irish coach Kevin Corrigan said, "We have not won two games in a row; yet, we are at .500. Offensively, we have been up and down all sea­son. Right now we are looking for some consistency." 
True to fashion, after scoring only three goals Saturday, the Notre Dame offense responded with a 13-goal outburst against the Fighting Scots. Nine of the goals came in the second half, when the Irish pressure ride fi­nally paid off. 
"We played very aggressively, and it cost us two goals early," Corrigan added. 
Wooster jumped out to an early 2-0 lead but, it did not last long. The Irish tied the contest at 11:22 of the second period when junior attackman, Mike Sullivan scored the first of his five goals. This feat left him one goal short of tying the Notre Dame record for most goals in a game. 

The remainder of the first half was relatively evenly played. The teams went into the intermission tied at four thanks to a goal by Irish sophomore midfielder Brian Mayglothing with 19 seconds left. Mayglothing also had a sensational game, scoring three goals and tallying three assists. 
The Fighting Scots took a brief one-goal lead early in sec­ond half, but it was wiped out with two Irish goals less than a

Kindred lectures on sports journalism 
By DAVE McMAHON 
Associate Sports Editor 
The emergence of USA Today has revamped the focus of sports journalism, according to sports columnist Dave Kindred, who presented the 1991 Red Smith Lecture in Journalism last night at the Center for Continuing Education. 
An associate editor of the daily sports newspaper The National, Kindred considered it an honor to be associated with as great a writer as Smith, who graduated from Notre Dame in 1927 and became one of America's most influential sports journalists. 

"This is an honor for me for me to be anywhere where Red's name is involved," said Kindred. "He was my hero; journalism is my life, and any combination of those things thrills me." 
Kindred first met Smith at Augusta (Ga.) National in 1967. While most writers would con­sider it a privilege to cover The Masters, Kindred had a specific

"I felt we played very well," noted Schultz. "The matches were all hard fought by the girls." 
The Saint Mary's College teams travels to Madison, Wisconsin this weekend for their Conference meet. Coach Schultz is looking for a good meet from Saint Mary's. 
"We hope to take second, if not first place this weekend," Schultz said. "If we do this, we will qualify for the NCAA tour­nament, which is our goal."

The Notre Dame baseball team came home after a long road swing seeking to find a rhythm, and after last night's doubleheader against Chicago State, it is safe to say that they have found one. 
The Irish swept the Cougars 5-1 and 5-0 in seven-inning games to raise their record to 21-12 and increase their win­ning streak to seven in a row. 
In the opening game, Notre Dame pounded CSU's Charlton Moore, tagging him for all five runs and knocking him out of the game before he retired a single batter. Mter Greg Layson and Craig Counsell led off with walks, Frank Jacobs crushed a 3-1 fastball over the right field fence for his team-leading ninth round-tripper of the year. 
Joe Binkiewicz followed with a double and Matt Haas walked. Mike Coss reached on a throwing error to load the bases, and Cory Mee was hit by a pitch, bringing in Binkiewitz. Moore was yanked and Gerald Davis, in relief, gave up a final run in the inning. Davis silenced the Irish bats after the first inning, giving up only one more hit the rest of the way and retiring the final 13 batters. 
Pat Leahy went the distance for the Irish, giving up one run on three hits and striking out eight, in raising his record to 4­1. 

"My control was pretty good tonight," said Leahy. "I didn't try to nitpick or get too fine out there. I just wanted to throw strikes. Chicago State is not as tough as some of the ranked teams we've played, like LSU or Stanford, but they pick up their game when they play us. They play tough because they want to beat us extremely badly." 
Leahy, however, was more than a match for the Cougar hitters, and Jacobs' homerun proved to be all that the Irish would need. 
"You've got to give credit to Davis (CSU)," said Irish coach Pat Murphy, " because he did a good job in relief. We hit the ball squarely, but were a little overanxious with that 5-0 lead." 
In the nightcap, the Irish got another stellar pitching per­formance, this time from freshman Tom Price, now 4-2, as they rolled to a 5-0 victory. Price, like Leahy, went the dis­tance, yielding only four hits while fanning nine Cougars and walking two. 
The Irish scored once in the second inning. Edwin Hartwell doubled, and scored on a throwing error on Dan Bautch's
