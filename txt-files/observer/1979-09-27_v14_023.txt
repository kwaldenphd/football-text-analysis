Bailly I. 
Unlike the Michigan plants, Indiana law will require cooling towers at Bailly I, he said, adding that this feature will almost eliminate danger to the environment. 
Proponents of the 660 mega­watt plant have also been accused of not providing a practical evacuation plan for the neighboring area. Lucey stated that although a plan has to be submitted to the Nuclear Regu­latory Commission before licensing, it has never been necessary to prove its effective­ness. 
To  put  such  a  plan  into  
practice  could  cause  a  real  
panic, Lucey remarked.  

In 1974, Bailly Alliance 
brought  a  suit  before  the  
Supreme  Court  testing  the  
evacuation  site  ruling  of  the  

NRC. The case was settled in favor of NIPSCO. 
Another suit was brought befort· the Supreme Court in 1976. This concerned a law that prohibits construction of power plants close to natural re­sources. The Bailly I plant is close to the Indiana Dunes State Park. This suit too was overturned and construction was okayed. 
Lucey also pointed out that in theory, a nuclear power plant produces less accidental radia­tion than the type of coal burning station now operating at Bailly. 
Coal contains amounts of thorium and uranium both of which are radioactive minerals.

SMC cancels Plastic Hymie Band appearance at senior picnic 
by john McGrath Senior StaffReporter 
What would have undoubt­edly proved to be an interesting sideltght to this afternoon's senior picnic at Saint Mary's ~as abruptly cancelled Tuesday mght. ''The Plastic Hymie Band,'' a five-member musical group headed by controversial campus figure Michael "Hy­mie" Heaney, was scheduled to perform at the picnic but according to Heany, plan~ were shelved after opposition to the concert arose among Saint Mary's students. 
'Tm very dissappointed," 
Heaney told The Observer last 
night. "I don't think that they 
(ptcnic officials) realize how 
much time we put into prepar­
ing for this.'' 
The controversy started sev­
eral weeks ago when· Notre 
Dame Senior Class President 
NickSchneeman invited Heaney 
a~d ~is group to perform for the 
ptcmc. 
"We've had a couple of picnics this year so far. and they've gone really well, so we decided we wanted music for this one," Scheeman recalled. ''I heard Hymie sing before, 
and '1 thought he did  a  really  
good parody of life  at  Notre  
Dame,  so  I  asked  him  if he  

would get the band together and provide music for the picnic." 
Joan Winter, Saint Mary's senior class treasurer, acknow­ledged that there was some apprehension among Saint Mary's students about the nat­ure of the concert. Heaney, an unsuccessful candidate in last year's student body president election, has in the past stirred controversy on both campuses in reaction to the satirical lyrics of his music. 
"I don't think it (the concert) would have offended the major­ity of them (Saint Mary's students), but seeing that it (the picnic) is a Saint Mary's funcuon, we decided not to take the chance," Winter explain­ed. "A few people might have taken it (satirical lyrics) to heart, so rather than risk that, we decided not to have him." 
there are not many women employed in executive positions at Westin~house, but stressed that there 1s room for women in these types of jobs. "There's always room 1to move up,'' she said. 
Mrs. Posi Tucker is a high school counsellor as well as a part time sponscaster. She is also the mother of four children. 
Combinin~~ these three careers is the toughest/art of working and Tucker sai it can only be achieved by ''sharing the responsibilities of the house with my husband and the kids." 
Tucker has a degree in elementary education from Indiana University and a Masters Degree in the field of guidance and counselling from the same institution. Tucker said that "my job as counselor is the most imponant." 
an open-net goal by freshman Mark. Luetk.el.ians. See story 
Heaney explained that the content of his concert would have been modeled after a similar event held last spring. 
"I think my track record would indicate that my per­formances are very popular,'' Heaney said. "We certainly 
were  not  planning  on  being  
rude or offensive.''  
Schneeman  informed  mem­ 

bers of Saint Mary's student government of his plans to invite Heaney, but after discus­sing-the matter with them, he agreed that the concert should be dropped. 
''I thought it was fair to warn the SMC people, and I told them that there would be nothing vulgar, nothing ob­scene," Scheeman said. But they decided that it was better not to have the concert.'' 
"If they didn't want us to play, that was one thing, but I think they should have told us a lot sooner (that the concen would be cancelled),'' Heaney commented. ''The ultimate losers are the people who have clamored for the PlasticHymie !Band to play at SMC.'' 
are there, it's a matter of being at the right place at the right time." 
Lois Kress is the personnel director for the Coopers & Lybrand public accounting firm's South Bend office. She recruits college graduates to work in various positions in the firm. 
Going to different campuses, Kress interviews the ''top notch'' students interested in public accounting. 
"For an intelligent woman with a desire to work hard, the opportunities in accountin~ are great," Kress said. "The mter­view may be the most imponant part ofyour applications. Being prepared for interviews of any kind is very imJ?ortant.''

Anti -nuclear activists attempt disruption 
VERNON,Vt. (AP)-Anti­nuclear activists intent on dis­rupting work at the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant sat down silently in a circle to block the plant's b~bed-wire gates yesterday. Thirty-three pro­testers were arrested. 
The demonstration was the second sudl protest in this tiny southern Vermont community in fo\lr days.. On Sunday, 167 demonstrators were arrested.

Plans are underway for the Fall, Community Fair to be held on Saturday, September 29, at University Park Mall in Misha­waka. 
Michiana's newest shopping center is sponsoring the event to provide local non-profit clubs and groups with a way to generate income in suppon of their organization's activities and to allow Michiana shoppers the opportunity to purchase handcrafted or specialttems not generally available. 
As good neighbors in the M:ich­iana Community, the members of the University park Merch­ants Association welcome all interested non-.Profit groups in­cluding soronties, service clubs, churches, and schools to panicipate in the Community Fair event.

Protesters voluntarily accom­panied police to waiting buses yesterday, and John W arshow, an alliance leader, said the demonstrators went along with police because they felt they had placed ''enough strain on police." On Sunday, demon­strators had to be carried to buses. 
Officials said those arrested were taken to a nearby armory to be held pen<;ling arraign­ment. 
Nearly ~0 protesters marched to the plant gate singing "We Shall Overcome,'' and most of the group then sat down in front of the gates. The others left, apparently to avoid arrest. 
A police spokesman read a warning to the group before officers began arresting the protesters.

Indiana group fights building of NIPSCO's nuclear power plant 
by Sal Granata 
An Indiana special interest group is continuing to fight construction of nuclear power plants along Lake Michigan's South Shore. The Bailly Alliance proposed to stop the Bailly Nuclear I Plant at Michigan City from beginning operations in 1986. Bailly Downwind is an offshoot of the alliance and has a following of students and faculty members in the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's community. 
The Bailly I plant would be the ftrst nuclear powered sta­tion in the No_nh Indiana Public Service Company's (NIPSCO) power grid. A license to commence work on Bailly I was issued in 1971. Almost immed­iately, public interest groups began delaying tactics to pre­vent progress. So far only the pilings have been approved. 
The generator and other­plant components are still sit­tin~in warehouses. 
Bailly Downwind has four established goals according to group spokesman Elizabeth Gilben. Its primary concerns are stopping the Bailly project, stopping funher nuclear plant building, promoting citizen input into energy policy and promoting safe energy alterna­tives such as solar, geothermal and wind power. 
The group also opposes two completed Michigan plants, the 2,000 megawatt Daniel Cook Plant a~ Bridgeman and the Palisades Plant in South Haven. 
Bailly Downwind states that South Bend is directly in the path of windborn panicles and gases that could be released during emergencies from the Michigan plants. 
Pubic safety is the major worry ofGilben, a Notre Dame sociology professor. "Some plants may have a type of valve that can misfunction and emit radioactive gases or panicles containing radiation mto the atmosphere.'' 
Gilben, a member of Down­wind's steering committee, expressed concern over nuclear power plant proliferation in the vicinity of South Bend. ''Nuclear power is too expens­ive to make safe,'' she said. ''It takes 12 to 14 years to build a plant and they cost over 1 billion dollars a piece. Twenty­five percent of all new capital investment in this country is going for plants that are/ood for only 30 to 40 years--1' like to see that money go towards developing renewable supplies.'' 
Professor Peter Smith of SMC believes that radioactive emissions might build up and contaminate Warren Dunes State Park. The dunes are only five miles from the Cook Plant. Radioactive effluent can accum­ulate in the sand and possibly effect persons who frequent the

Davia said the incident demonstrated weaknesses in the agency's payment proced­ures. He urged tighter controls to assure that checks are sent only to bona fide contractors. 
Asked by Sen. Max Baucus,D­Mont., chairman of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on fed­eral contracts, ifsuch a "sting" could be successful again, Davia replied that weaknesses in GSA's financial safe­guards create "many oppor­tunities" for such payments. 
However, William J. Rita, GSA finance director, angrily denounced the test as a "piece of theatrics" that succeeded only because the auditors sup­pressed the very controls they were testing.

Food service supports Nestle ban

There will be an organizational meeting at 6 p.m. Sunday in the Regina North Loun~e for the "Inquiry Into Catholtc Beliefs" discussion group. Basic ques­tions about the Catholic faith will be discussed. Sr. Veronica, of Saint Mary's cam_pus minis-· try, will lead the dtscussion. The meeting is open to the public. 
dum released yesterday, Rita noted that a receiving clerk had found that the_,.ordered supplies were not delivered, but were stoJ?ped by the · auditors from nontying the finance division. 
"In this bizarre episode, it seems the auditors set out to prove that if they used their credentials to suppress or over­ride all internal contols, there would be no internal controls,'' Rita said. 
The memo, which listed its subject as ''the gang that couldn't shoot straight," said the "fraud" was detected sev­en days after the check was issued and the money was recovered. 
Rita said that althou~h the finance division is ''inclmed to believe'' the false payment was part of a legitimate audit, the matter has been referred to GSA's office of investigations "on the chance that we are dealing here with real fraud.'' 
For more than a year, the GSA has been the subject of a major investigation into wide­spread fraud and abuse that by some estimates cost the gover­nment more than $100 million a year. 
The investigation has resulted in the indictment of 115 former and present GSA officials, con­tractors and other government employees. Of those, 89 de­fendants have/leaded guilty or been convicte on fraud charges. 
Another 25 have not yet been tried. One government official was found Innocent. 

products in stock at the time the 
ban was initiated have been 
depleted. 
"There was a small, if any, 
monetary impact on our opera­
tions when we stopped using 
Nestle Products,"Robinson sta­
ted. "However, it did eliminate 
Nestle from our competitive 
bidding program and they (Nes­
tle) were very competitive." 
The elimination of Nestle "Nestea" powdered ice tea mix did cause the dining halls to stop serving powdered iced tea because the dispensing mach­ines could not be converted to accomodate other brands , " Robinson said. He also stated that a similar problem occurred with the hot chocolate dispen­sers, but he expects hot choco-1 late to be offered very soon in 
the dining halls. 
"The boycott has been effec­tive here in that all Nestle products are no longer being purchased," World Coalition Director Mike Stegman, "On a nationwide scale, I'm not sure now effective the boycott has been in changing Nestle policy." · 
He added that the WHC will 

__conduct a study this year of Nestle marketing policy in the Third World and will make a report to the students. Huddle manager John Pros­niewski stated that the directive has also been implemented smoothly at the Huddle. The Huddle has replaced some Nes­tle products with Lipton and Royal food products without its increasing costs.

Following Wall's comments,· Roemer introduc•· t the new director of security Mr. Glen Terry. "My approach as new director of Notre Dame's Secur­ity is one of service to the students, faculty, and staff, "Terry told the gathering. "If I can live up to the work ofJoe Wall, I think the University will be well served, and I will be extremely happy.'' 
Others who attended the luncheon also expressed their feelings about Wall. ''Mr. W/all has brought with him new policies, and he has worked hard to create a new image for the department." said Dan Everett, a security patrolman. "We've come a long way." 
''As the old saying goes,'' commented Shift Commander Sgt. Boyd Fuhr, "I hate to see Mr. Wall leave, but I am looking forward to establishing the same kind of working relationship with Mr. Terry that we had with Mr. Wall."

[continued from page 1.] 
Fr. David R. Jenky, rector of Sacred Heart Church speculat­ed. that one of the reasons for the lack of an organized trip from Notre Dame was the proxim:ty of Chicago to the 
campus. "I know some people who wi~I. be gio!lg up by priv~te ~eans, he satd. Another reason why a trip wasn't scheduled is that trans­potation WflS arranged already by the Fort Wayne/South Bend dtocese. The Chancellory in Fort Wayne in coordination with the South Bend area director Harriett Kruell, has arranged 
for space on two trains, at total of 500 places. 
Approximately 330 people have signed up thus far, leaving the remaining spaces available only on the train departin~ at 6:15a.m. The cost of the tnp is $7, which includes a box lunch. 
The price of the trip goes beyond ~my monetary value though, according to Bishop Crowley, bishop of the diocese of Fort Wayne/South Bend. ''The pilgrimage will include a long hard day of walking," he noted, "and you have to have faith or you wouldn't do that."

Malone stated, however,· that use of the electric autos doesn't mean there will be less energy consumption. "We will need more electricity and we will need more fuel to produce that electricity,'' he noted. 
Citing that the use of gas or oil to produce electricity would obvtously be counterproduct­ive, Malone emphasized that greater use of coal and nuclear power woul<!. ~e needed to generate electicity. 
Malone believes, however, that because of the present political and environmental climate surounding the use of the two fossil fuels, that no real advantage has been gained with the electic car. 
"It's (the electric car) not terrible exciting at the moment. It's at least five or six years away. It's not doing much for us because of the nuclear and coal restrictions," t, e-said, ad­ding, "I don't 5\. it as an effective reliever of the energy problem.'' 
An Indiana and Michigan Electric Company official, how­ever, doesn't think the new auto will have much effect on electrical consumption.

Goshen fell prey to Saint Mary's field hockey team 2-1 on Tuesday night. The match held at Saint Mary's gives the Belles a 1-2-1 record this fall. 
Patti Meagher celebrated her birthday With a goal mid-way through the first half to initiate the SMC scoring. Goshen's Lisa Clemmer put her team on the scoreboard with a goal n~ar the end of the half. 
The two teams remained dead­locked until the second half when Belles team member Patti Tuite scored to put SMC ahead 2-1 for good. 
''Our forward line was work­ing well together and we were on the attack through most of the game," commented Ann Deitle, who is currently in her third year as SMC field hockey coach. 
"We're getting better as we're playing. Unfo{tunately, we dido' t score a lot of goals, but we were in there and won it," continued Deitle.

Counsilman credits Title IX 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP)-A federal law requiring equal status for men and women in scholastic sports was instru­mental in helping]ames "Doc" Counsilman break an English Channel swimming record, the Indiana University swimming coach sar.s. 
Counsiiman, 58, became the oldest person ever to swim the channel when he did it in 131fz hours on Sept. 14. He said the federal ruling helped provide him with the time he needed for training because he was able to turn over some of his coaching duties to women coaches. 
At a welcome home reception here Tuesday, Counsilman said if Title IX had been instituted earlier, he would have swum the channel years ago.. 
Counsilman, who was the 214th person ever to success­fully complete the 21-mile trip, said swimming the channel was his teenage dream. ·._ 
He swam a total of 1,200 miles during his ten-month training for the event. 
Counsilman dido' t know he would be vying for any world records when he began training last year, he said. The fact was pointed out to him by a sports writer only a few mon~hs ago. 
He said he hopes his feat will attract top-notch swimmers for his IU teams and promote the sport of marathon swimming as the ideal exercise for adult fitness. 
Under Doc's tutelage, IU has won Bi~ Ten championships the past ntne years in a row and National Collegiate Athletic· Association crowns from 1968­1973. 
Counsilman said his excessive training for the channel paid off. 
"Frankly, it dido' t hurt at all. 

I've heard Diane Nyad complain~ after all her pony swims. There are no pain systems at all if you are psyched up," he said, referring to marathon swimmer Diane Nyad. 
Ms. Nyad captured headlines with her attempts to swim from points in the Caribbean to the Florida coast. 
She failed during July 1978 in her effort to swim from Cuba to Florida. In August of this year she completed a swim from the Bahamas to Florida. 
'.'Most of the thing~ sh.~ sw1ms are nothmg, Counsilman said of Ms. Nyad. "It's just so sad that people who are more deserving don't get the attention.'' 
Saint Mary's 
to sponsor Jog-a-thon 
The Saint Mary's Athletic Department is sponsoring a Jog-a-Thon on Sunday, Sept. 30 beginning at 2 p.m. The two mile jog will take place along the path between Saint Mary's College and Notre Dame. Proceeds from the event will go to the SMC Fun and Learning Program for Children with Learning Disabilities. For more information call Mo at 5 797.
