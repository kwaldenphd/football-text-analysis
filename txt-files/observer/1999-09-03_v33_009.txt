ICONN loses license 

By JOSHUA BOURGEOIS A"istant News Editor 
The Irish Connection, a South Bend club localfld at 525 North llill St, surren­dered its liquor license Wednesday to the Alcoholic Bnverage Commission (ABC) due to a recnnt citation against the dub. 
The Indiana Excise Police charged The Irish Connection with "failur«i to maintain a high and f'ine reputation." The police issLwd a citation to the club because of a bar light that led to five arrnsts in May and a l998 raid that caught 95 underage drinkers in the club. 
An agreement with the Irish Connection, the t\BC and the city of South Bend permitted club owner L1ion Townsend to surrender the liquor license in order to forego the permit "trial." The trial was scheduled for Sept. 21. 
According to Townsend, he agreed with the settle­ment offered by the ABC because he knew that he would lose in trial. 
"Thc prosecutor I Fred Bauer] gave us options. and he told us what would hap­pen if' we went to Lrial. This came rather suddenly. II' their mind is made up, then why fight it," Townsnnd said. 
Townsend compared the citation to a "disorderly con­duct charge" and says that the fight that occurred in May "can be considered the death penalty to Lhe bar." He says he docs not undcr­stand the reason why the dub would lose its liquor license for such a charge. 
"There's been many other bars with worse situations and worse lights than ours. They haven't lost thoir licenses. Compared to those bars, we're the bov scouts," Townsnnd said. , 
Currently. the liquor license is in escrow, and Townsend hopes to sell the license soon. Townsend told the South Bend Tribune that "someone out tlrnre is always looking to buy a liquor license." 
ABC Prosecutor Fred Bauer told the South Bend Tribune that "there are a finite number of permits available and no new ones

Jump Around 
So who else is behind in their reading'! 
Yes, it's the second week of class and I'm already vastly behind in my reading. But I've come to a conclusion; a wonderfully liberating conclusion I'm sure many of my peers adapt to: Who cares'? 
Who cares'? Who cares if I'm behind when it's an ahsolutPly gorgeous day'? Who cares if I'm behind when there's the Michigan game this weekend and I'm positive l won't get much done before I leave'? 
This is not to say that I 

don't care about school. I

care very much about going to class and learning. I care ahout listening to my pro­

being educated. being moti­vated. What I do not care to do is stress out. Two years have shown me that too much of that goes on 
hem. 
One thing we shouldn't forget is that this mix of success and failure, pep rallies and hang­overs, is a gift. 
It's this big, gold jumping rope we whip around enthusiastically. We jump and jump, get tired and somehow forget why we started jumping. We take for granted our legs and feet propelling us upward and our hands, tightly gripping the handles. 
We lose sight of the jump, the push that made us decide, "Yes, this is where I want to be! This is what I want to be doing!" We lose that kindergarten zeal -the need to jump as high and as fast as we can. We end up just jumping. 
Yes, getting into a good grad school is key. And what business major wouldn't love a sweet deal from a Fortune 500 company? These things are very important. But so is living. So is spending time with friends and realizing that no matter how much we gripe and moan, there is life here at Notre Dame. 
The other night I gave up hanging out with friends to read up on the Great Depression. I patted myself on the back for bejng so morally upstanding and responsible. 1 fell asleep on the couch after an hour. What did I accomplish'? An hour's-worth of reading for a class l'm still behind in? What's the point? 
The point is I'm not going to do that any­more. If I have a test the next day, or if l'm on the second of a ten-page paper at 3 a.m., believe me, I'm not leaving my room. But I refuse to give up my life to study. 
I care a great deal about grades and like any student here, I want to do the best I can. But I'm by no means a GPA junkie. I have no idea what rank I am, and I don't want to know. 
There are thousands of different ways to be an educated individual. Many people think all there is to it is to read, read, read. I emphati­cally disagree. 1know that that's not what col­lege is all about. That's not what life is all about. Can you really find yourself, your pas­sions, make the greatest friends in the world while staring into a Calculus book? 
The solution to this quandary is simple. Every once in a while, slow your jumping. Steady your pace. Think of the first time you knew that big, golden rope was yours. Just remem­ber why you're jumping. Remember your legs, your feet, your hands. And just jump around.

Iowa researches tumor 
IOWA CITY, Iowa 

University of Iowa researchers may have discovered a process by which aggressive cancerous tumors spread, a finding that could eventually change how tumors are diagnosed and treated. The discovery that tumors may make their own blood vessels to create their own blood supply was reported in the Wednesday issue of the American Journal of Pathology. The UI researchers include Robert Folberg, a professor of pathology and anatomy; Mary Hendrix. a professor and chairwoman of anatomy and cell biol­ogy; and Andrew Maniotis, assistant research scientist in anatomy. The new findings challenge the prevailing theory on how tumors spread by attracting existing blood vessels, a process called angiogenesis. "What our study describes is a process that is independent of angiogenesis," Hendrix said. As a result of the study, new avenues of cancer treatment could now be con­sidered for patients who are currently using drugs designed to inhibit angiogenesis. "This changes it, because there are all kinds of drugs people have been taking to treat angiogenesis," Maniotis said. 
Texas-Austin frat settles 
AUSTIN, Texas 

The University of Texas-Austin Omicron chapter of the Kappa Alpha fraternity brought an end to a year of hazing litigation whnn it settled out-of-court Wednesday for $1.65 million with Tim Ilesselswnet, who accused the organization of mental and physical abuse during hazing. In addition to the monetary dam­ages, the fraternity agreed to several policy conces­sions which Hesselsweet's attorrn~y. Bill Whitehurst, said will help to check hazing in the futurn. "There have been lawsuits bdore, and none of" them have brought about a difference," Whitehurst said. "Tim difference in this case is that hen\ we haw\ a fraternity that is willing to mako a change. We'rn hoping that will spread to other fraternities. If' not, tlrn system is going to die from within." I lcsselsweet, a UT sopho­more, filed the suit against the fraternity, the UT chapter, its president and thriw "rush captains" in February 1998. The UT chapter of the fraternity agreed to settle after the third day in court. Attonwys for the fraternity and the fraternity prnsident namml in the suit were not available for comment.

Rosenthal, Athletic Director at the time, said the dPcision was made because of the University's continuing reassessment and realignment of its athletic pro­grams. The sport's funding and 13 scholarships were given towards women's teams and its coach of eight years, Frann McCann, was given a job teach­ing physical education al Notre 
Dame. 
"It wasn't a happy situation," McCann said earlier this week. "It was a dilTicult time." 
Nor were administrators pleased about dropping wrestling. Associate din~ctor of' Athletics Missy Conboy was involved in the decision and said she wishes the move had not been necessary.

Forecaster praises El Nino for good effects 
Associated Press 
WASIIINGTON 
For a while it seemed as though everything from torna­does to toadstools and hail­storms to hemlinns was being blamed on El Nino. Now, it turns oul. the poriodic weatlrnr event produced a lot morn good than bad. 
That's thn conclusion of cli­matologist Stanley C:hangnon. who calculated that while thli 1997-98 El Nino can be blamed for 189 deaths. it also can be credited with preserv­ing 850 lives that would have been lost in normal winter and hurricane snasons. 
And its $4.2 billion to $4.5 billion in damage is far out­weighed by nearly $20 billion in benefits, Changnon reports in 11m Septemb11r issue of tlrn Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. 
"I I' you treat it as an cco­nomic....o.utcom,• for the country ... most of the country lwnnfit­ed." Changnon said. 
Trun, the El Nino wnath1~r plrnnonwnon was blamed l'or major storms in California and. by some, f'or deadly tor­nadons in Florida and an ice storm in Urn Northeast. 
But. it also producPd an exceptionally mild winlcr in 111ost of tlrn Nortlrnrn st.ates and blockPd /\llant.i('. Coast hurrica1ws. 
"I figurnd, just watching what was happening, that it was going to b1! a zPro-sum game but it turiwd out far from lhat." Changnon said in a tn]ephonn inlnrvi1'w from his MahomPl, Ill., homo. 
Micluwl Glantz, an El Nino nxpert at tlrn National Cent1!r for Atmosplrnric HesParch in Colorado, was skeptical.

Ozga and Smith ½'.ere accused of money launder­ing, replating violations and failing to report $1. 2 million in illegal income. Other

RUSSIA 
Terrorist group takes clai01 to bombing 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW 
A previously unknown Islamic fundamentalist group claimed responsibility Thursday for the bombing this week of an upscale shopping mall near the Kremlin in which 41 people were injured. 
The claim, made by tele­phone. said the bombing was connected to fighting between Russian troops and Islamic militants in ·the southern republic of Dagestan. But some officials dismissed the daim as a hoax. 
Shards of glass and metal were blasted through a video game arcade and a row of crowded fast-food restaurants in the underground Manczh shopping complex in the Tuesday night explosion. Several of the victims remained hospitalized with serious injuries Thursday. 
A man who identified himself as Khasbulat and claimed to be a leader of the Islamic Army. for the Liberation of Dagestan called journalists Thursday to say his organization was responsible for the blast. "Terrorist acts will continue on the territory of Russia until all Russian troops withdraw from Dagestan," the caller said. 
The rebels in Dagestan have suffered several defeats recent­ly in the lighting, and Russian officials fear they could resort to terrorism to persuade foder­al troops to back off. 
A spokesman for the Federal Securitv Service (FSBJ in Moscow ·said the claim seemed to support a connection between the blast and the Dagestan fighting, the ITAR­Tass news agency reported. Thll spokesman didn't clabo· rate. But some authorities were skeptical of Thursday's claim. 
"I think lthe militants} are _just trying to give themselves more weight. !The claim] doesn't ring true,"said Interior Ministry spokesman in Dagestan, Ycvg!'ny Ryabtsnv. 
The bombing stoked fears of terrorism in the Russian capi­tal and police bet~fod up securi­ty around lhe city. 
A central Moscow train sta­tion was evacuated Thursday after p~lice found a suspicious­looking handbag they beliewd contained a bomb, but it turned out to be a false alarm. 
Thn Islamic Army for the Liberation of Dagestan was not a known group in Dagestan, where scores of small Muslim fundamentalist organizations operate. 
A suspected Islamic militant leader named Khasbulat Khasbulatov, was arrested in Dagestan earlier this week and was still in custody Thursday on charges of participating in this month's fighting, illegal weapons possession and incit­ing religious hatred, officials said. 

INDONESIA 
Militia wreaks havoc in East Timor 
Associated Press 
DILi 

Pressure built Thursday for the United Nations to deploy armed peacekeepers to East Timor, as Indonesian security forces failed to stop pro­Indonesian militia gangs from wreaking havoc on the territory. 
The violence in the wake of Monday's independence refer­endum left two more local U.N. statfors dead Thursday and snnt thousands of people !1ceing their homes in the provincial capital of Dili. 
Automatic gunfire echoed across Dili and houses were on lire in nearby villages. 
The U.N. workers were killed in Maliana, 80 miles west of Dili, which has been the scene of recent violence by the militias, l'.N. spokesman Frnd Eckhard said in New York. He had no other details. 
The killings came one day after lighting between pro-and anti-indepPndence supporters killed at least three people near the U.N. compound in Dili. 
The Maliana attack brought to four the number of local U.N. workers slain since Monday, when East Timorese swamped the polls to cast bal­lots in a referendum to deter­mine whether their territory will become independent from Indonesia, which invaded in 1975. 
Almost 99 percent of regis­tered voters turned out despite a militia campaign of terror to keep them away.

Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said plan­ning already was under way "for a U.N. security presence to be brought in place in East Timor," hut only with Indonesia's consent.

Take cold showers, save the planet 
Environmentalists. members of the Green Party and Progressives take note. We should start taking cold showers, This is no joke. We have a serious pollution problem on our hands. Power plants pump thou­Jeff Langan sands or pollutants into the air each year. This causes 
Lula's Journal 
smog and acid rain that kills plants and ani­mals. It ruins plants' immune sys­tems. making them more susceptible to life-threatening diseases. It ruins lakes and rivers. the natural habitat of fish. Trout and salmon are being born with half developed gills, three eyes, and two tails. It might even hurt humans. 
These power plants also deplete mother earth of her natural resources. using up precious reserves of coal and uranium. After two centuries of abuse. she cannot take much more: Laws have proven ineffective. The polluters have bribed Congress and State Legislatures into submission. The only real response left is the personal one. You and I are to blame, and we can do some­thing about it. 
Think about it. Sociologists working in close conjunction with officials from thousands of water depart­ments and the waste management workers across the country have spent years proving their hypothesis that, on average. men use twelve gal­lons of water and women use fifteen gallons of water per hot shower. 
No big deal, you say, but it is a big deal. Multiply that by 280 million and imagine the figures you end up with in this countrv alo,rn. It takes a lot of coal and uranium to get that water hot. And of course, in many cities, it costs energy and money to get that water to and from your shower. The plants that produce this energy arc notorious for polluting the atmos­phere. The hotter your shower, the more they pollute, and you let it hap­pen. 
Unlike some other problems in our society, you can do something about this one. There is no need to protest, no need to write your local congress­man, and no need to hug a tree. You can act, tomorrow morning. So tomorrow, when you step up to the plate -I mean the faucet -and the timn comes to choose between the II and the C. choose C, and you will be saving mother earth from he·r pend­ing doom. And as you shriek for fear, wondering if you will ev11r survivP this fiasco, imagine all those pollu­tants you are preventing from billow­ing into the air at the local power plant. You have done your part. not only will you have not used any hot water, you will have used less water. 
or cours11, that is not all. We will have to educate others. Since educa­tion is no longer about learning the truth, but teaching social skills that get one to conform to the dominant liberal ideology, we will have to con­vince everybody to take cold show­ers. To begin, we could have an advertising campaign. We could get funding from environmentalist groups to plaster, "Be Bold, Do it Cold" on billboards up and down the fruited plain. Following the l11ad of anti-smokers, we could put up bill­boards of stupid looking people tak­ing hot showers. 
Perhaps TV advertisers could show the faces of men and women soaping up. shampooing. and rinsing under col,d water. The expressions would be mui:h more intc1rnsting and capti­vating than tlw sen•nc look pnwalcnt in most ads tlwse days. We could make TV shows and movies in which the guy who takes a hot shower is the bad guy, or someone taking a cold shower gets away from the bad guy. Do you think the girl in Psycho would have been done in by Norman if slrn was taking a cold shower? 
Next, we could promote scientil"ic: research that n\vcals the lwalth ben­efits of cold showers. Thev incrPaSt! your hnart rate, which is it fo;·m orUim;; exercise, and will add years to your life. They probably am bettnr for people with acnP. Tl11\y makP !"or more nl'ficinnt use of timn. With a cold shower, you're in and out. No standing around dreaming about never-1rnvnr land. This means you get to work faster, and can be more efficinnt and productive, the two most important values in a capitalist society like ours. 
They also make J'or·a qui-ck burst of energy in tlrn morning to get all tlw sand out of' tlrn eyes. This might also reduce tlw need fur rol'ft;e, dP1-rnas­ing ca1Tni1w addictions. Thn lwrwf'its are endlt\SS. I will lnav1! it to sriPn­tists and nutritionists to f"igure out them all. In short. they will tell us that by taking cold showers. we will not only lwlp the environn11111t, Wt' will help ourselves, making tlw sacri­ficr, worth it.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Petty co01plainers lose sight of true suffering 
l'l<•asn foq~iv<~ nw l'or tlw reactionary naturn or this article. Please for­givn its S<'l'lllingly ad homirwm appcararn'.c as woll. It is not intended as an attack on any 01w individual author. Nor is it an attack on an entire stu­d('nt body. It is simply an PXprnssio11 ol' my conc11rn for and dismay al the supPrlicial and ungratdul natun1 of writing that I lrnv!i nl'tcn seen elicited l'rom 111n111lrnn; or a studPnt bodv that is so blnssed to bH at this school. 
Though I haw olkn h<wn angnrnd and PV!~ll disgustNI by what I have road in our school's ,wwspapPr, I havo seldom l'elt that an article so strongly WHITlllltn<l rdrnkn as "Who ll(~(~ds an ~I_arm Clock?" br Maureen Srnitlw 011 Ttwsday. August :n. This artidn typ1!i11s and ep1tom1zes every­thing that has rlislurb!'.d me about a certain type of narrow-minded writ­ing in Tlw ObsPrvnr. I'm tirnd ol' lrnaring over-privileged college students ridiruln tlw wondPrf'ul and ploasant womon in thP cafotcria for the way llwv look. I am tirnd ol' lwaring tlwm S('()ff at the l'ood WP am all so blessed lo liaw. Arni I will not stand by as an idlo witncs:,; to an assault on the work of' nrnn and wonwn making an honest living by kPeping this campus llw h1\at1til'ul plac11 that it is. 
As lo Smillw. I'm sorry to lrnar Lhal rnu:h morning she i:,; torn from her r.ornon of:,;uburlmn luxurins by tlrn rudn grunts and groans orwaking rPality. Unfortunatnly, WP on this campus live under the constant b~rrage of harsh rnalities like tho benping of conr,rete trur,ks. Much to our dismay, "slatn-root'ml and marbh• lloored buildings" don'l just materializn out of thin air lik11 a pink-ribboned Mercedes on tho driveway for Sweet 16. 
Tlrnrn urn good r1'asons for such an early start for construction work, not tlw l1!asl of which is to minimiw Lim harsh nffncts of the "generous and abundant August lwat" in which llrnsn m,•n and women labor. Smithe of' all 1woplc should sympathize lrn_causn it is the_ same _h_eat i_n wh_ich she so loath1\S lo slnnp. Imagirw :,;pm1d111g the rt-isl ol your ll{n domg mght hours of' ha1:kbrPaking work. six days a W!)nk, just to makn ends meet. Tlwn J)('rhaps prmnaturn awakenings by lh11se "pi1m:ing" intrusions would not sc\om so insuffcrabll'. 
I hav1i no air-l'onditioning in my home. This summer there were four diff1mml major construction sites within a si1!gle block of whern I Jive. My windows rnmained opntrnd as the screams ol Jackhammers and concrete saws shook me l'rom sleep each morning. While she was enjoying the "rnrnf"ort. of my own 11uffy bed and the sncurity of my pink painted room," I was listoning to hard working 111(\ll and womon making a little bit of noisn in ordnr to hold Urn structures of' our society together. My antidote to this slight di:,;turhancn was an understanding that we livn in a world that rnquirns constant maintonanl'n and of'ten times Uw casualty of this reality is our 1:011V!Hlirn1cn. 
Mornovnr, I was most grotesqudy appal Ind by lrnr conscription of the word "suffnring" to !'urtlrnr hnr nrnssagn. Using it as shn dons, "We am sufforing lrnni," stw blasphnmcis tlrn vnry meaning of the word and insults all thoso in the world who are truly in pain. If the loss of a fow precious mi nu Les or :,;lnep justilins the usa~w or so gravn a term in her mind, then I truly pity hor. I can only hope that this was written in jest. 
For too many of us, when confrontnd with the facts of life after two docadns that lrnv1! bnt\n drapnd in luxuries and convnnicnccs, we have built no immunity to Lhem and recoil at the their "jagged" manifestations. I lowcwnr. I bnlilwn thn problem at hand is not so much the lack of "respect l'or llw !'.0111munily and tho 1rnc1els within it" as a gross lack of perspective. So, to all ol' you past and futum authors or assaults_and pro'.1ouncomc.~ts or grinvanc1is upon tlw impPrfocLions and inconvem.cnces of campu~ life at tlrn Univ<1rsity of Notre Danrn, buy some earplugs (I ve got plenty of nxtras). shut your windows, go to bed a lit.tin earlier, or put a pillow over vour lwarl. But ,wxt Limn you fod likn haranguing your rnaders with the i1x<:rt11:iation ol' the inconveniP11ces that plague your existence, plP-asn stop and wusider thosn in tlw world who arn truly sulforing.

SMC leadership too quiet 
Both the campuses of Saint Mary's and Notre Dame have been reading about the Notre Dame administration banning GALA's ads in The Observer. We've read where! Prnsidunt Malloy stands on this issue. My question is this: Wh11re does the administration of SMC stand on this issue'! The Observer speaks for both campuses -1paid my twelvn dollars al thn bPginning of' the year. I'd like an answer to my question; as a stud<~nt hMf!, I deserve one. This is my education and I'd like lo know tho parameters of it. Will I be allowed to explore all avenues of thuught or will I be conlined to the administration's mode of thought? But I'm not even asking SMC to condemn ND's land now the Observer's] policy, nor am I asking SMC to condone it. All I'm asking l'or is a decision, so I know whnrP l stand on my campus. SMC has a responsibility to its women -the mission of' this school is to educate well-rounded women, to show wom11n that they can make competant decisions for themselves. What kind or an examplP-,is au administration that refuses to stand up and speak out on an issue that is cHnlral to both campuses'?

Administration needs to open prejudiced eyes 
It is time the Univorsity of Notre Dame opened its prejudicec.l eyes. The Catholic Church is NOT against homosexuality. The Church encourages gays and lesbians to hav1i gay and lesbian friendships. What the Church is against is any sex that is not for procre­ational purposes and takes place outside of marriage. 
In the Church's eyes, the only acceptable form of sexual intorcourso is between. a mar­ried man and woman for the sake of creating a child. That being the case, there rs absolutely no reason GALA shouldn't be allowed to advertise in The Observer. 
Outreach ND/SMC should be an official organization recognized by the Univer:-;ity, as GLND/SMC should have been. Why aren't they? Because pcoplti arc always scared by things that differ from them and their ideas. . 
Groups like Outreach ND/SMC and GALA are designed Lo support_gays and lesbmn:,;. That does not mean that they encourage casual sex or any sex. It simply moans that they supply an environment that docs not otherwise exist on or off campus. The:,;e groups am necessary because many members of the straight majority ma.kn them so. 
These groups do not oppose any of the Church's teachings Alicnal(ng ai~ enti~c s_ector the student body by labeling who they are as wrong, however. does. fhe Catholic C!rnrch teaches acceptance and love, not conformity and alienation lo th?se who don't_conform. 
I am straight. My sexuality is an intrinsic par_t of who I am but 1t dc?e~ r~ot delinc who I am. I do not have, nor do I wish to have, sex w1Lh every male I see. 1 his 1s not by any stretch of'the imagination, an outrageous claim. It doesn't even need to be said. The same shouldn't have to be said for any gay man or lesbian woman. Tlrnir snxuality is an intrinsic part of who they are but it does not define them. The term "homosexual" docs not mean "practicing homosexual." . . .. 
We arc all made of the same basic "stuff." When you get down to 1t, you arc no dtlfer­ent from me or the person sitting next to you. Very few peopk today judgu others who are of a different skin tone or religion than the majority as a lessm pnopln. Why on Earth should sexuality make one bit ol' difference'? The answer is: it doesn't. Ilowcver, until the majority accepts this as common knowlndgc, groups liko Outrear.h ND/SMC am necessary. As a Catholic institution, the University of Notre Dame should set_ ,~n n~ampln of love and accnptance to a world that does not always accept people who d1ffnr lrom thn majority.

Roadtripping season has once again descended upon Notre Dame. Heres a I 
By AMBER AGUIAR 
Scene Writer 
With football season comes roadtrip season, and this weekend thousands of Domers and Belles will travel to Michigan for Notre Dame's first away game. 
This will be the first of many roadtrip opportunities this year, with the Stanford game the only away game more than a day's drive away. And students across campus are already planning for future treks. 
"I can't wait to party on someone else's campus. We're always nice to visitors here, so hopefully they'll be the same way," said senior Brian Rigney. 
Sophomore Matt Kloser looks forward to watching this week's game from Michigan Stadium. "I have a friend that goes to Michigan so I'll get to sit in their student section," Kloser said. "Of course I'll still be cheering for Notre Dame. But I know we wouldn't really like it if some Michigan fan decked out in all their stuff was cheering in our section, so hopefully I won't die. I'll be sure not to taunt anyone." 

Some students like senior Jen Baltruzak are looking forward to away games just for the long drives. "Sure I want to see the games, but what I really can't wait for are the actual trips. There's nothing better than a good roadtrip," she said. 
Even members of Notre Dame's band, like senior Ruth Luckas, are looking forward to the bus ride to the first away game. "I can't wait for what we call Crudwclls, where we can make new freshmen do whatever we want. Anything from fetching a soda to reading very personal and risque accounts out of maga­zines like Cosmo," said Luckas. 
Many are already looking beyond Michigan to later games. 
"Purdue is the only place I know where you can get burritos the size of your head," said Baltruzak, recalling the slogan of a Mexican restaurant she passed and wanted to stop at on the way to Purdue her sophomore year. 
She is among many juniors and seniors who remember roadtripping to 
Purdue for a game two years ago 
and are looking forward to going 
back. 
"But this time we're going to beat them. There's nothing worse than a long drive home after you've had a loss. No one talks and everyone's irritable. It's ter-. rible," said Baltruzak. 
Others are waiting for the longer, overnight trip to Tennessee. 
"Why Tennessee? Because Tennesseeiri' is Tennebelievin'! " said senior Erin Orthmeyer. "It's the only place I've ever been where you can still get Sundrop Soda and candy cigarettes. And the town sheriffs double as mid­wives." 
After an eventful fall break trip to Tennessee where she encoun­tered a small town sheriff with a leprechaun tattoo who hailed from South Bend, and now splits time delivering babies and fight­ing crime, Orthmeyer can't wait to go back. "You never know what will happen next," she said. 
According to junior Keith Kawamoto, the trip to Knoxville will be awesome. 
"Tennessee is going to be crazy! There will be over 100,000 screaming people and you'll be there in the middle of all of it with all of your friends. It's the perfect time to get away from school and just have fun."

What was your best or worst roadtripping experience? 

"On the way to BCs game last year, we had a bit of a delay when one ofthe cars struck a deer that tore out the undercar­riage ofthe car. We ended up waiting at the rest stop for three hours be/ore Triple-A came. Then we had to go to BFE. Ohio. to drop offher car. We all crammed into the two remaining cars and continued our trip." 
Jacki Bonaguro 
Junior, Lyons 


"We went from Phoenix to San Diego to visit a couple offriends. Then we decided to go to Mexico to have a good time in Tijuana. We got lost over an hour deep in Mexico. with no one speaking Spanish to get directions. To make matters worse, the car went offthe road and we had to push it up over the gravel path. And we got to the border, we had to wait about 35-40 minutes just to cross. I've decided to stick to the border towns ofMexico."

away for any student, but personal travelling preferences vary. Many roadtrip­pers try to be as efficient with time as possible, stopping only when necessary. 
Senior Rob Razzano, on the other hand, recommends remembering "to stop at several gas stations along the way to take advantage of all the cool, cheap stuff you can find there." 
But regardless of their personal roadtripping styles, students agree that some things arc always essential. "All you need are good buddies, tickets, a grill and most importantly, the 'Higgs Party Mix.' There's nothing like jammin' with the Higger," said Rigney. Mixed tapes prepared before a roadtrip are popular sta­ples, and according to students like Rigney, they are one of the most important parts of a great drive. 
Razzano agrees. "Good music is definitely key. I'd recommend some good SoulhArn Rock. or maybe some Blue Grass. Hut Metallica is essential in case you get tired while you're driving," he said. 
According to senior Brad Conners, another important element of a good road­trip is comfortable travel. "There's nothing worse than trying to cram eight people in a car made for four and a half," he said. 
Others suggest that snack foods are a key element of an enjoyable roadtrip. "Good food is what makes a good roadtrip," says Orthmeyer. "It wouldn't be onicial without beef jerky, a burrito supreme and a slurpee. Besides, stopping for food breaks up the monotony of a trip." 
Kloser agrees that especially when planning to drive to an away football game, it is important to consider food. "You have to take a grill, one small enough to fit in your trunk, that you can pull out in the parking lot when you gel there. It's an instant tailgater. Just throw on some brats and it's glorious," he says. 
But above food, legroom. and music, good company is on almost everyone's list of roadtrip essentials. "The most important thing is the people you go with, bncause you won't have a good time if you don't get along," says Kawamoto. "lloadtrips are all about the camaraderie."

CLEVELAND 
Richie Sexson's three-run homer capped another big inning for Cleveland against the Anaheim Angels, sending Charles Nagy and the Indians to a 6-5 victory Thursday night and a four-game sweep. 
Sexson's lhird homer in three games against the Angels gave him 27 this s(rnson. and was his second three-run shot of the series. On Tuesday night. he hit a three-run ho.mer to close out Cleveland's 10-run eighth-inning rally. 
Nagy (15-9) allowed one run and eight hits in-seven innings. The l'ight-hander joined Atlanta's Greg Maddux as the cmiy pitch1ws in the ma_jors to win at least 15 gamos in each of the past Iive seasons. 
Garret Anderson and Tim Salmon hit two-run homers in the ninth for Anaheim. Mike Jackson, the Indians' third reliever in the inning, earned his 33rd save when David Justice robbed Troy Glaus of a hit with a leaping catch at the left-field wall.

Holtz, Bowden make 
game family affair 
Associated Press 

COI.U'.'VlBJA, S.C. 
Bowdon vs. Iloltz. 

,It sounds like a video ganw football fantasy, but it's real, from recruits' living rooms to "Lirn with Hegis and Kathie LPc." 
Clmnson's Tommy Bowden and South Carolina's Lou Holtz have bPgun a rivalry that could last decados ­and thoy clon't even play for almm:t tl1rne months. 
"There's not a lot or patim1ce here," Bowden said. 
Clemson opens at home Saturday against Marshall. and South Carolina travels to No, 24 North Carolina State. Holtz vs. Bowden, hownvrr, has UfWIJ irnprinlr.d on !'ans' minds since thc•y both arrived in Decemb(1r to res­cuo ph1gra111s in distross. 
Almost imrnPdialfilv afuir llwy arrived: · 
. 
Bowdt'n snagged lloltz's prndecnssor Brad Scott to help with arna recruits. Holtz snagged Snulh Carolina's "Mr. Football," runner Derck Watson. 

. 
Iloltz created a state· widn stir with an antilitter campaign. Bowden was soon signed up f'or public service ads for the sume campaign. 

. 
The Columbia post office announced a special enve­lope commemorating lloltz's debut; the Clemson post office rushed the same for Bowden. 


. Talk show host Regis Philbin talked up his friend Holtz 011 tho air this spring. Then Bo\'Vd(m's wife, Linda, wrotn Philbin to rr.mind him there was another rising star in the state. 
"She's a true Clemson gal now," Bowden said. 
Clemson-South Carolina is onn of the South's mum sav­age, ii' not cnlnbrated, matchups. 
The Tigers tout their 1981 national championship and Atlantic Coast Confer(rnce success with then-coach Danny Ford. South Carolina backers counter with their 
loyal support. sPlling out Williams-BricP Stadium four straight ynurs dPspitP just one bowl victory in I(H, sna­sons. 
Two duys af'tpr Bowdnn's introduction at Llnmso11, South Carnlina piped in with lloltz, who has sincn llsPd his nwgawatt charm to pro• motn thn university and rnadjusl its losing atlitucln about football. 
Neithf'r is playing it up, howPV<'r. 
llo Ilz said wlrnn hn was hirPd that Clmnson "obvious­ly got· a far b1ittr~r-looking. youngPr and mon• intc\llignnt. guy than nm." Bowdnn, 45, rnmt1mlH\J'S lloltz and his wifo staying with his llill'l\nts as a child. 
"I nially know him hy lwaring my f'atlwr talk." thn Clt>mson coach said. 
Bowdnn keeps an nye on South Carolina, hut a higgnr one on his Atlantic Coast Conl'erencc fons. lloltz rnc• ognizes Clemson's impor­tancn, hut says thr (;anrncocks have a tough enough task in tlw Southeastern Confornncn. 
Ile laughs at fans who say all they care about is lrnating the Tigers. 
"You try going one and 10 and beating Clnmson f\ight years in a row. You won't Im coar.hing here," Im said. 
Holtz wants support from everyone, including Clemson fans, and is tPaehing thP Gamecocks to love thy rival. 
"If you'rn a South Carolina ran. you ought to pull for Clc!mson 10 tinrns a y1•ar,," lloltz said. "l'noph! say tlrny go lo the circus and boo tho tiger. That's the wrong approach." 
It may Im too soon for a Gamccock-Tignr detentP.

former would 
be ready for 
the Sept. 12 opener at 
Philadelphia. But the rehabil­
itation is taking longer than 
originally expected. 
''I'm not bothiired by it." Swann said, ""becaus•1 I have to be 100 percent whnn I step back on the field and that's a fact. I can't go out there half­ready or a quarter-ready, I've got to be 100 percent. The surgery was a very aggressive surgery and sometimes it takes longer than usual." 
If Swann's timetable is accurate, at th() earliest he wouldn't be back until the Oct. 17 home against Washington. Arizona has the following week off, then plays New England at home on Oct. 
31. 
Swann went to San Francisco on Wednesday to be examined by Dr. Richard Steadman, the noted knee specialist who performed the surgery on Dec. 7. Tests con­ducted by StPadman showr.d the strength and flexibility of the knee had increased from 50 percent to 80 percent of' normal. 
Swann p I ay<! d in seven games last season, then had surgery performed by the Cardinals' orthopedist Russell Chick. The team expPcted him back in a few we()ks, but Im was dissatis­fied with the results and went to Steadman. the Colorado-basf'd doctor who

"If you were to take the kner1 and just split it in half and look al it, there's a lot of wear and tear in the hard cartilage on the boni,s there," Swann said. "There were a lot of bald spots there that were actually wearing out. There were nerves hitting nerves." 
"When you have a situation like that, it makes it very ten­der to walk around and very tender get in the squatting position and play, because you've got a lot of grind. On top of that, you add 300-plus or 600-plus pounds of guys double-teaming you and cut­ting you and you've got a pretty heavy, spicy, ouchy dish, if you know what I 
mean." 
Now, Swann said, "if things stay on course and there aren't any terrible setbacks or anything and I don't rush it, I could play another five or six years easy." 
Swann hadn't spoken to reporters about his condition since before last year's first surgnry. 
In his brief conference call, he insisted he wa_s not both­ered by the criticism he received from fans and local sports talk show hosts who thought he should have playnd through the pain as the Cardinals made their postseason run.

Ripken connects for 400th career home run 
Associated Press 
BAI.Tl MO HE 

Cal Hipkcn hit his 400th rar,wr homn run Thursday night, joining an cxclusivr\ cir­dn or sluggPrs whosn mnmlwr­ship 110w stands al 2<).

/\s llipknn rounded thn hasPs. the s1·11rPboard scroll,,d a list or all his homP runs. lln was grPt>ll'd warmly by his 
teammates in the dugout, then came out and tipped his bat­ting helmet to the standing crowd. 
The crowd remained on their frwt as the Devil Hays made a pitching changP. Hipken used tlw delay to wavn again to the apprnciative crowd. 
The shot, nstimatnd at :H2 fed, was his 16th honu•r of' the season and lirst since .July 25. Iln spPnt a month on the dis­ablr!d list with rrnrvo irritation in his lower' back befOl'I\ being activated Wednesday. 
Hipknn returned from his snconcl stint on the DI. inlPnt upon blocking out all thoughts about hitting No. 400 and nwv­ing dosnr to his :3,000th hit. 
"I always try to downplay that,"he said. "The home runs, I'm tickled to death that I'm able to contribute and have that kind of success." 

"If they come. they come and I'll be vnry happy about it. If they don't come, my earner won't bn any less fulfilling as a msult of that." 
But he admitted to trying to hit one out in his last home game boforn going on the dis­ablnd list. . 
"I tried to hit a home run because I thought it would be great to do it hem at home, "he said. 
"l was abln to concentrate and put a good swing on the ball. But it seemed to take me out or my game a littln bit, try­ing to swing hard and hit a 
home run every time. You can't hit a home run by swing­ing for it." 
The home run gave Hipkcn 2,969 career hits. If' he gets No. 3000, he will gain entry into an even tighter fraternity of hitters: those with 3,000 hits and 400 homers. 
The only players to accom­plish tlw f'eat am Ilank Aaron, Willie Mays, Eddie Murray, Stan Musial, Dave Winfield and Carl Yastrzcmski. llipkcn and Yastrzemski would be thn only ones on the list to play their entire career in tlrn American L<lague. 
When it com~,s to durability, however, llipken stands alorrn. Ilis consecutive games strnak of 2,632 games, which he vol­
untarily ended last season, is 
the longest such run in base­
ball history.

NHL 

Minnesota 'Wild' about first general manager Risebrough 
Associated Press 
ST. PAUL. Minn. 
\'linnesota Wild CEO Jae Sperling has aecomplished what former l\linncsota hockey coach Herb Brooks couldn't. 
He lured Doug Risebrough out of Canada. 
"Life has a funny way of com­ing around," said Risebrough, who was hir11d Thursday as the Wild's first general m"anager and executive vice president. "Twenty-eight years ago, I was recruited bv a number of col­leges and the only trip l made was to the University of Minnesota to see Herbie 
Bro[)ks." 
Ris.-,brough decided to go straight to the pros instead, 
"It worked out for both of us long term," Risebrough said. "Herb boasted about the fact that he won a national champi­onship with an All-American team, and I would have been the blemish there." 
"And the same year that he boasted about that, I was hoist­ing the Stanley Cup over my head with the Montreal Canadiens." 
Risebrougb, 45. who has spent 25 years in the NHL as a player, coach and executive, has been vice president of hockey operations with the Edmonton Oilers the last three years. 

Sperling said he had to com­pensate Oilers general manag­er Glen Slather to sign Risebrough bul wouldn't divulge details or other terms of the contract. 
"I will just tell you that Glen didn't get to be one of the best GMs in the league by being a rollover kind of guy," Sperling said. "But I want to tell you also that he is a very tough negotia­tor and he has trained Doug well." · 
Risebrough said he is in no hurry to hire a coach before 
next year's expansion draf'l but will begin buil<ling his front oflicc aud scouting staff imme­diately. 
The Wild begins play in the 2000-2001 season at St. Paul. returning the NHL to Minnesota after a seven-year absence. 
Risebrough said he might bring some Oilers personnel with him to Minnesota. 
"Glen has never really opposed anybody from improv­ing positions," Risr,brough said. "I have had to deal with that generosity because l hired a lot of the people that he's let movn on.... He just said, 'Don't take too many."' 
Tho Wild also considered sev­eral othnr candidatos, including general managers Craig Patrick of Pittsburgh and Bobby Smith of Phoenix. but Sperling said RisPbrough "was our numlrnr orrn choice. No othor of'l'ers were extended." 
A forward, Risnbrough playml eight seasons in Montreal and five for Calgary. Tho natiV!! of' Guelph, Ontario, was a l'irst­rou nd draft selccti on by Montrnal in 1974. Aft!!r playing for four Stanley Cup champions in Montreal. he was traded to Calgary in 1982 and rntirnd in! 987 with 471 points in 740 games.

Steady Hanson back for Buffalo 
Associated Press 

OHClfARD PARK, N.Y. 
For so long, he's been in the shadow of' Bruce Smith. lie hasn't starred in much highlight footage and his best seasons have come during Buffalo's post-Super Bowl years. 
Now. Phil l lanscn, one of tho NPL's steadiest. def1msiv11 nnds, is ready to go after u knee injury. But will anybody notice? 
"I play the best I can," said IJansen. "If recognition comes, great. !fit doesn't, play harder." 
Hansfm plays hard. lie ranks third on the tfiam with 50.5 career sacks, behind Smith with and Cornelius Bennett (52.5). But morn telling are Hansen's 694 career tackles. 
"No, Phil doesn't get double digits in sacks," Smith said Thursday. "He'll get his eight or nine. Hut he'll get near 100 tackles, sometimes a lot more, and that's a hell of an effort." 
Showing no trace of the knee injury that sidelined him for the last two games last season, including a playoff loss to Miami, he had three sacks in last week's exhibition win against Cincinnati. 
With Smith grabbing the spot· light and gargantuan Ted Washington clogging the mid­dle, Hansen has a way of get­ting lost. 
"The underrated thing will always be Phil's handle, I guess," Buffalo coach Wade Phillips said. "But Phil is poised to have a good year. You can see his play on the field was outstanding." 
'Tve enjoyed having him as my other bookend," said Smith. "There are some who shine a little bit more, but I'd rather play beside Phil than about 75 percent of the defensive ends in the league." 
Hansen relies on a work ethic he learned while growing up on the family f"arm in North Dakota. Ile tries to avoid inter­views and is modest to the point of sclf'-e!Taccment. 
But the biggest reason hll doesn't get much reeognition is simple: He's not involvt\d in enough high-profile plays. 
"Unfortunately, it's all basod on sacks," Phillips said. 
Hansen's career high or 10 sacks came in 1995. The last three seasons he totaled 21.5 
...

sacks and was well above or closo to I 00 tackles each or Urn last four snasons. 
Steady and rnliable doesn't win votes. But it does mak<i people miss you when you'ni gone. 
Hansen sprained his right knee in a 17 -10 loss to tho .JeL, last December wlwn a team­mate landed on him. Hansen recalls being surprised at the severity of the injury. 
"I thought I could go back in and play," he said. The tnam doctor told him to sit. 
The injury ended Hansen's team-high streak or 86 straight starts dating to 1993. 
"It was a long offseason," he said. "I knew I wouldn't bn able to test the knee until camp." 
But Hansen felt so good on the first day of camp, he forgot about his knee. 
"Afterward I said, hey, my knee is OK," Hansen said. 
Hansen has bnen bntter than OK since. He and Smith com­bine with nos<1 tackle Washington to givn Buffalo one of the best defensive lines in football. 
They have the support of some of the best linebackers in the business. And perhaps Doug Flutie can lead thmn back to the Super Bowl. That would please Hansen like nothing else. 
"If I didn't bnlieve we could get there," he said. "I wouldn't be here."

Last year on the Lor,h u,?Yd course south of Kansas City, Brett caddied all the way for close friend Larry Ziegler. who edged Tom Sl,law ~y ~ne stroke for his second Senwr Tour victory. 
"George can only be here on Friday," Zieg!Ar said. "Since he was inducted into the Hall of Fame this summer. it's unbelievable how hectic his life is."

One senior who will not ho competing for the $180,000 first place money 1s home­town favorite Tom Watson. He did not reach his 50.th birthdav -minimum age tor 
Senior ::four entrants  - until  
later in the week.  
Kansas City officials  were  

denied a spedal exemption. They had hoped Watson's birthday could be fudged by a few days, allowing hi1~ to play before what certarnly would have been a larger gallery. 
"When you start cha_nging_ regulations for those kind of reasons, you run the risk of raising questions of credibili­ty about the entire rules structure," PGA Tour com­missioner Tim 
Finchem said. "From the standpoint of credibility, it didn't seem like it made a lot of sense. although we would have loved to have Tom play." 
The Tiffany Springs course opened in May and has suf­fered in the intense heat and drought that has gripped the Midwest. 
"Our agronomist looked at it in July and said it was ter­rific," Finchem said. "But then they've had some heat stress and drought. Heat and drought affect the new root structure more than an older. mature golf course. But everybody's been worki~g hard. I think given the cir­cumstances, we'll be fine. The players like the layout and we've got a great field." 
Ziegler figures the winning score could be as much as 18 under par.

MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL 
Reds lose sleep over Braves 
As<uciated Pre•• 
CINCINNATI 

Call it a hex. Call it a tradi­tion. No matter how hard they try -and maybe they're trying too hard -th,e Cincinnati Reds ,1ust can t beat the Atlanta Braves. 
In the last throe years, thAy'vc played the Brav_es ~9 times and can count their vic­tories on one hand. 
"Anv time a club heats you up like they havfl, it seems like they have your num­ber, "Reds third base·man Aaron Boone said. 
Thev have all the numbers: 

an g:1 record against the Reds this season, including.a pair of three-game sweeps in Atlanta; a 29-5 mark over the last three years; eight consec­utive series wins since September 19%. . 
Atlanta's 8-7 victory Wednesday night completed their season series and left the Beds with an all-too­familiar feeling. The contend­ing Reds are one of the n:iajor leagues' biggest surpri~es. but there are no surpnses when they face the NL's top team. 
They just don't measure up. 

"From where we were at the beginning of the year to the club that we've become, we felt like we were ready to climb into that elite group of teams,"Boone said. "But to do that, you've got to be compet­itive against those teams." 
It's something of a mystery why they're not. The Reds 
"From where we were at the beginning of the year to the club that we've become, we felt like we were ready to climb into that elite group ofteams. But to do that. you've got to be competitive against those teams. " 
Aaron Boone Reds third baseman 
have gone 8-1 against NL West leader Arizona, 8-3 against NL Central _leader Houston and 5-4 agamst the New York Mets, the other team currently in contention for a wild-card berth. 
The Braves are an entirely different story. The Reds' onlv victory over them came Mo~day. when the B_rav~s didn't get into town until 3:30 a.rn. and got drubbed 11-3. 
Atlanta went on to score 16 runs in the next two games. 
'Tm glad to see them get out of town,"manager Jack McKean said. 
Reliever Mike Remlinger, who went to the Braves along with second baseman Bret Boone in the Denny Neagle trade last November, thinks the one-sided rivalry weighs on the Reds. 
"You've got that in the back of your head, even if yo_u don't want 1t there,"Remlinger said. 
Maybe the Beds just try too hard. 
"From being on the other side of it, I know when I pitched against tlw Braves I_ always tried to be on t'.JP ~'.( my gamc,"Hemling~r said. I think everybody feels that way. Whether tlH1y try lo do more than they should or they·rc tight. I don't know." 
The Reds are inclined to think it's just one of' those mysteries of baseball. 
"I think of the other clubs that have given us a tough time -San Diego last year,"manager Jack McKcon said. "Thtiy did it to us. Wn'vc clone it two years in a row to Arizona." 
Last year, the Padres won 1 I ol' 12 from the) Hr~ds. Over the past two soas?ns. _the Heds havc won 13 of 18 from tlrn Diamondbacks. 
The Beds-Braves matt1u goes back much farther and runs much deeper. It's been so lopsided that the Beds felt some relier after turning a 7­1 deficit into a one-run loss Wednesday night. 
"It makes it competitive and it makes it fun,"shortstop Barry Larkin said. "Of course~ you want to win. It's a good situation that we came back. It's a conf1dnncc builder. It's all about respect." 
The Braves rnspnct tlrn Reds even as they boat thnm. 
"We know they're l'or real."Bret Boone said. "You don't play as good as they have to this point and lw a f'luke. We know we hav1) to play our best against tlrnm; It just seems likn when we! vn played them, wci've played thnm very well."

Bulldogs look to Carter for scoring 
Associated Press 

ATHENS, Ga. 
If' most schools lost their four top receivers, two bost offensive linemen and leading runner, there would be ample reason to ask: How are they going to score any points? 
At No. 12 Georgia. which is in that predicament, no one seems the least bit nustered because of' one player who returned: quarterback Quincy Carter. 
"He had a lot of confidence last year, but he has even more this year," receiver Michael Greer said. "I don't know what it is, but you just look in his eyes and you know he's a winner." 
Carter is only a sophomore, but his Q rating is already soaring off the chart for the Bulldogs as they finish prepa­rations for Saturday's opener against Utah State. 
llis teammates picked him as one of four permanent cap­tains for the season, an honor normally reserved for juniors and seniors. The school has launched a Web site dedicated to promoting him for the Heisman Trophy. 
He is expected to lift the entire offense, even though he can't look to a receiver who caught more than 13 passes a year ago and can't hand off to a runner who gained more than 161 yards. 
"You know he'll get the ball to you in the right place, a place where you can make things happen," said Greer, the top returnee at receiver. "It's fun to play with him." 
Clearly, Carter feels more ai

easn than he did a year ago, when hP-.ioinnd the Bulldogs for fall practice after a recruiting fight with rival Georgia Tech, having not playod a football game in two seasons while he pursund a career in minor league basf!­ba!L 
Nevertheless, it took only a fow weeks for him to win tlw job, making him the lirst true freshman to start at quartnr­back for Georgia in a season opener since 1945. 
"Last year, I had buttorllies before the first game," the <>· foot-3, 223-pound Carter said. 
"Now, I'm sleeping well dur­ing the week. I've scti.led in and I know my roln on this team." 
His role is a bit of every­thing. Carter broke most of Eric ·zeier's school freshman passing records, comµleting 176 of' 290 passns for 2,484 yards and 12 touchdowns, and also ranked second on tho team with 284 yards rushing. 
In addition, Cartnr showed a fortitude lacking in most freshman, shaking off threri interceptions in the Peach Bowl to lead the Bulldogs l'rom a 21-point dflficit to a 35-33 victory. 
"You're looking at a guy who barely had time to learn the offense before hn was starting," of'fonsivn guard Steve Herndon said. "I !ti's a lot more relaxed when he gets back there to run the plays. It's helped a lot just knowing the system." 
Carter thinks the turning point came in the ninth game last season, when he faced Auburn and defensive guru Bill Oliver.

Although l"iorth Carolina leads the s1iril'S 5-2-2, the Irish havn fP('orded sevei·al signif'icanl blows to the Tarhcl'is' storied history.

IIPad coach Handy Waldrum, formerly head coach at Baylor. replaces Chris Petrucelli, who became head coach at the Univorsity of Texas last spring. 
Waldrum has made one signif­icant alteration: a dofensive alignment change from !'our midficlders and three defensive backs to three midfielders and four defensive backs. 
Lindsey said the team is adapt­

"Our defense is improving everyday," she said. "I think we are going to have the strongest midliPld in the country."

MEN'S SOCCER 

Undefeated team takes on Big East rival Eagles 
By KERRY SMITH 
Spores Writer 
With one win behind them, members of the Irish men's soccer team have dispelled fears of youth and inexperi­ence. 
After defeating Northwest­ern 1-0 on a goal by freshman Bafael Garcia Wednesday, Notre Dame is looking ahead to its ho1m1 opener against Big East rival Hoston College on Saturday. 
"I was reli(wed to score and put us on top," said Garcia. "It boosted our team and took the other team out." 
While the Irish entered Wedn(isday's match-up with a relatively inexperienced defensive line, it played a key role in defeating the Wildcats, as the game remained score­less until well into the second half. 
"We played very well defen­sively," said Garcia. "We played like a solid team." 
Captain Gerick Short proved his capability in goal. after being sidelined last year with a shoulder injury. 
Making his third career start for the Irish, Short came up with two saves and recorded his first shutout. 
The Irish still have a long road ahead of them this sea­son and the Eagles are the next stop. 
Ranked ninth in the Big East preseason poll, Boston College is coming off an injury-filled and disappointing 5-'J0-2 1998 season, but healthy players and a strong recruiting class have increased the team's competitiveness this snason. 
The Irish offensivP line will be put to the test, as the Eagles have a stingy defense

Irish prepare to boot Tarheels in Classic 
By MIKE CONNOLLY Associate Sports Editor 
Unlike the football team, Notre Dame's women's soccer team jumps into its toughest game of the year without a_ warm-up. 
Tonight against North Carolina, the Irish put a new coach and a new defensive philosophy to the test. While an easier first gam(, would take pressure oil Notrn Dame, the team is excited to kick off its season against the Tarheels. 
ul think it makes it all the more exciting to start off with your big game," junior captain Kelly Lindsey said. "I don't think we arc at a disadvan­tage. Of course, a practice game would be nice, but I think we will be alright."

Irish look for answers in Ann Arbor 
ByTJM CASEY Spores Writer 

With all the attention gen­erated toward tho dispute over the so-calle.d gentle­men's agr.eement, it's easy to forget that them is still a game to be played on Saturday. 
Question marks still remain after Notre Dame's 48-13 victory over Kansas. 
Ca11 Jim Sanson respond after missing three kicks'? Can the passing game muster more than 89 yards? Can the young offensive line and cor­nerbacks handle the pres­sure of playing in front of a hostile environment? Can the team cut down on its three turnovers'? 
"This is a big test for our football team." Bob Davie said at Tuesday's press con­ference. "We all sec the great tradition of this rivalry. And we are a young team. For us to make this a great game, we are going to have to show considerable improvement from last week." 
Michigan, ranked seventh in thP r-ountrv, has a talented offense. • 
Anthony Thomas, the Wolverines leading rusher from a year ago spearheads the running attack. At '"'ide­out, sophomore David Terrell and senior Marcus Knight have big play capabilities. Lloyd Carr has yet to name a starter at quarterback as of Wednesday for Saturday's game. Either way, Davie does not plan to make any major defensive adjustments. 
"Just looking at the two, both of them I think are pret­ty similar," Davie said. "Both of them are tall and have strong arms. You just felt in the game [last year] that [Drew l Henson seemed a lit­tle more mobile. But as far as change in your plans or in your approach, I don't think we'll really change." 
The front seven for Michigan is also a concern for the Irish. Senior lineback­ers Ian Gold, James Hall and Dhani Jones solidify the mid­dle of the defense. At defen­sive tackle, Roh Renes and Josh Williams are both expe­rienced. 
Carr understands the importance of this game from a historical perspective. 
"The tradition of Lhese two programs is outstanding," Carr said in a prepared statement. "They're arguably the two greatest traditions in college football going back over 100 years. It's the tradi­tion knowing that every sin­gle person in this country that likes college football will be trying to watch this game. It's that kind of excitement that every kid who grows up playing football dreams of playing in." 
One player who is ready for Saturday is Grant Irons. Irons older brother, Jarret was a key member of the Michigan defense earlier this decade.

. Cornerback's leadership inspires younger players 
By BILL HART A,~ociare Sports Editor 
D1•veron II arper d uesn 't hes­ital1\ when he answers what his greal11st moment in his Irish playing career is. 
"My intnrception rnturn this weeknnd," he said. "That was d,ifinitely a drnam of mi,w. I was glad to accom­plish that." 
For a player that has bnen such a solid contributor on the Nolrn Dame defense for so long, one would expect it would take longer to come to a dncision. 
Starting games for the Irish as far hack as his frnshman yl!ar, it's hard to imagine a Irish secondary without him in position. It was hard even for llarpp,r lo imagine, hp,cause from the first timH he stepped on campus, he was drawn to Notrn Dam11. 
"I wus rnally c:onvim:r.d by my visit." he recalled. "I had a

good time, and the teammates 
that took me around were a 
big thing. Acadomics, athletics 
-those were the main fac­
tors." 
As soon as he donned the 
blue-and-gold Jersey, Harper 
played an immediate role on 
the team. Depletions in the 
secondary put him in the role 
of top reserve cornerback. He 
amassed experience there 
quickly, thanks to numerous backup appearances. 

When a hamstring injury bothered starter Ivory Covington, th en -freshman Harper was thrust into the starting position for the USC game. He wasted no time to contribute, breaking up passes and tackling twice for losses. 
Sophomore year saw a quick return to top backup corner­back, before injuries forced him to move to a starting role at free safety by the fifth game of the season. He proved his prowess in that position as well, starting in eight of the last nine games, including the Independence Bowl. 
Ilis exceptional play that season brought national attention, as he was ranked 10th nationally among corner­backs by Lindy's as the '98 season approached. 
As a junior, Harper was the logical choice to take a start­ing role in the secondary with the graduation of defensive cornerstones Covington and Allen H.ossum. 
Once again, he stepped into the position and continued to display the same determina­tion he showed during the first two years of his Irish career. 
Michigan fans will not have to be reminded this weekend about No. 10, after a perfor­mance in last year's opener where he recorded eight tack­les, a sack and forced a fourth-quarter fumble that ended any hope of a Wolverine comeback. 
Harper started in 10 of' 12 games in his most successful season, recording 48 tackles, three sacks and two fumble recoveries. By midseason, he was forced to the sidelines by a hamstring injury, but he recovered quickly enough to. start the -final games of the regular season and the Gator Bowl. 
Heading into his senior year, Harper found himself thrust into the starting role again, but this time with an evcrn greater need to contribute with Tony Driver's move to tailback. 
With his 22-yard intercep­tion for a touchdown against Kansas, Harper has proven once again that he is more than ready to take on the chal­lenge. 
"Basically, we were trying to read a three-step on the Kansas quarterback," Harper 
recalled the play. "I was able 
to read it, and I broke on tlrn 
ball. Ile threw it, and I just 
picked it off." 
Even as a freshman, Harper has felt the need to lead the team by example. Now, as a senior, he feels the prossurn upon him even more. 
''I've always tried to be a leader," he said. "As f'ar as keeping my teammates' heads in the game. But it's morn important now, because the young guys who just camn in look up to me as a senior." 
Harper's leadership has not gone unnoticed by freshmen .on the team. 
"lle's been like a mentor to 
me. I watch him in practice, 
looking at how he moves and 
turns," freshman defensive 
back Albert Poren said. "I talk 
to him and he gives me advice, 
for both on and off the field." 
Harper looks at this new responsibility, to lead by seniority as well as by exam­ple, as something more than just a privilege. · 
"When you're a senior, it's your duty to be a leader on the team," hn said. "That's exactly the responsibility that I havn to handln now."

EVE ON THE ENEMY 
Brady, Henson battle for UM starting job 
By BRIAN KESSLER 
Sports Editor 
()u a.rterlrnck controversy is surrounding lhe Michigan foot­ball program these days and head roal'l1 Lloyd Carr is kf1eping his mouth shut. 
Aflor spending tho last fow wnuks blasting Notrf' Dame for adding Urn Eddic Hobinsun 
Classic to its schPdulc, Carr laughnd ol'f the media and wouldn't reveal his starter al Monday's prnss conf'Prnnco at 
Michigan. 
llt• did, however. admit that he mado a decision about who will start !'or tho Wolv<1rin('S on Saturday. 
Thn Detroit Nuws rnported W1,drrnsclay that last year's starter, l'iflh-year senior Tom Brady, will gHt the nod on Saturday. The papnr, citing toam SOLll'CllS, also reported that sophomorn sensation Drew I Innson could see playing time as narly as the second quarter. 
Brady senms to be the more logical choiw. llo completed ov,ff hO percent ()f his passes last s<mson and threw for mom than 2, 600 yards, while leading the Wolvorines to 10 victories. 
If Brady can connect on a touchdown pass Saturday, he will tie the school record of 13 consncutivn games with a touch• down pass. 
Brady led Michigan into battle in Notre Dame Stadium last sea­son. llo completed 23-of-36 passns for 267 yards in a losing effort. 
I lenson also saw action in last s0ason's gamo against tho Irish. In his collegiate debut, Henson guided the Wolverines to a touchdown in his first series at quarterback. Ile completed an eight-yard pass to Jorame Tuman to cap olT a 10 play, 80­yard scoring drive. Henson con­nected on 5-of-8 passing for 55 yards. · Tho sophomore finished the season 21-of-47 passing for 254 yards and tlm•e touchdowns. 
Henson, however, spent the summer playing minor league baseball for th<' New York Yankees and may not be as pre­panid as Brady. 
No matter who gets the start, the Michigan quarterback will have some big targets, as the Wolverines return five receivers from last year's six-man rota-

Allhough Tai Streets movl~d on to tlrn pros, seniors Marcus Knight and DiAllo Johnson are prime time players. Sophomore David Terrell, who verbally com­mitted to the Irish out of high school, is a deep threat. Senior Kevin Bryant and sophomore Marquisn Walker round out the taJent group of receivers. 
Brady and Henson should get excollent pass protection, as Michigan boasts arguably the bnst offensive line in tlrn country. It returns five starters, including preseason All-American Steve Hutchinson. Seniors Jeff Backus and David Brandt also anchor th(' Michigan otfonsivP line. 
ff the Michigan passing game struggles, the Wolverines will 
look to the  run game to bail  
them out.  
Michigan  lost  Clarence  

Williams to graduation, but junior Anthony Thomas head­lines a list of four backs who saw aclion last season. Thomas is the team's leading returning rusher with 1,442 yards on his career. He has rushed for 20 touch­downs and finished the '98 sea­son with three 100-yard perfor­mances in his four games.

AROUND THE NATION 


MICHELLE KEEFE/The Observer Courtesy of Tennessee Sports lnfornation Office 
The start of the 1999 football season signals the return of Lou Holtz (left) and Jamal Lewis (right) to the football field. Holtz begins his tenure at South Carolina whlle Lewis returns from a knee injury that caused him to miss much of the Vols 1998 nation­al championship season. 
Tennessee begins national title defense 

Observer Staff Report 

Peerless Price and Al Wilson are gone to the NFL but quarterback Tee Martin and tailback Jamal Lewis are back for the national champion Volunteers when they take on Wyoming Saturday. · 
Lewis and Price are not the only Vols back for another run at the title, Tennessee returns 14 starters in the hope of improving on the best record in the last two years of any team in col­lege football. 
Even without Lewis for much of last season. the Vols succeed with replace­men ts Travis Henry and Travis Stephens who combined to rush for over 1.400 yards. Martin, Lewis, Henry and Stephens give the Vols the deepest and most talented backfield in the country. 
With all the attention focused on the Tennessee offense, it is easy to forget how good its defense is. 
Despite the loss of Wilson, the Vols still have one of the best linebacker squads in the country. Raynord Thompson and Eric Westmoreland are returning starters who pursue well and hit hard. 
Wyoming does have some talent hut not enough to match Tennessee. Quarterback Jay Stoner passed for 2,373 yards and 11 touchdowns last year. 
Stoner's favorite target is also back in Wendell Montgomery. Montgomery caught 57 passes for 789 yards but failed to catch a touchdown pass. Wyoming will need Montgomery to get into the end zone this season as they have lost leading rusher Marques Brigham. 
The Wyoming defense is the strength of the team. Its "bend but don't break" approach gave up lots of yards last year but shut teams down in the red zone. 
No. 23 Virginia at North Carolina 

For the past few seasons, this has been a matchup uf two of the premier teams in the Atlantic Coast Conference. 
The departure of Mac Brown' from North Carolina to Texas, however, sig­naled the downfall of the Tar Heels football from the nationally elite. 
Virginia has been one of the steadiest programs in the country by posting 12 straight seven seasons with at least seven victories but has fallen behind Georgia Tech for the honor of being the second best team in the ACC -behind Florida State. 
Although the game has lost some of its national luster, each team features an excitjng player on offense. 
Virginia features Thomas Jones, brother of Irish freshman Julius Jones, at tailback. Jones rushed for 1,303 yards last year to lead the ACC in rush­ing. 
The Tar Heels offense is directed by two sport star Ronald Curry. Curry, who also stars for the Carolina basket­ball team, passed for six touchdowns and accounted for 1,394 yards passing. 
Curry's play provided the spark for a team that began the season 0-3 before responding to win seven of their next nine games, including a 20-13 win over San Diego in the Las Vegas Bowl. 
The win in the Las Vegas Bowl made North Carolina the only football team to have·won four straight bowl games. 
South Carolina at No. 24 North 
Carolina State 
Lou Holtz takes his South Carolina Gamecocks, who finished 1-10 last year, into Raleigh to face a team he used to coach: the Wolfpack of North Carolina State. 
The Wolfpack is flying high after its upset victory over No. 17 in the Black Coaches Association Classic last week­end. NC State's special teams blocked three Longhorn punts to set up the vic­tory. 
NC State features explosive quarter­back Jamie Barnett. He is on track to become the first quarterback in ACC history to pass for more than 10,000 vards. · South Carolina has a highly touted coach, but not much else. The Gamecocks were the only SEC team to lose to Vanderbilt last year. Holtz has worked his magic before but for South Carolina to be a winner, it might take more tricks than even Holtz can muster. 
Arturo Freeman, who returns to the South Carolina secondary after missing 1998 with an injury, is one of the few bright spots for Holtz.

Notrn Dame's :~6-20 win over the Wolvnrirws in both l1mm's season opener a year ago grounded the

Wlwn asked whether

Michigan quarterback 
Tom Brady spit out a 
statt)ment that sounded 
prntty well-rehcarsnd: "It's not about gntting 
them back or paying them back. It's about 
going out and playing our type of football." 
Almost convincing and maybe true. That is, if the two teams weren't playing in front of 107,501 p1iople, not to mention a national tnlevision audience. Or if' head coach Lloyd Carr and his Wnlvnrines wnrnn't so humiliated by tlm Irish two wnflks in a row last season. 
Yes, two Wf'Hks in a row in 1998. First by Bob Davin and tlw Irish and a wnt>k latnr by llw Syracusn olfons11 !Pd by now Irish coach l<Pvin Hogi•rs. Thnn•'s no way that ,Jim I IPrrmann 's Michigan defense isn't looking hark at those two games -in which the Irish and Syracus,1 scornd a combinnd 74 points ­and feeling a little angilr and, yes, revenge. 
Tnm, gonn arP Notre Dame's experienced otfonsive linenwn and all-time leading rusher Autry D1mson. And so is tlrn honrn-lield advan­tag<'. Arni Hog<irs isn't coaching a Syracuse olfonsu Ind by Donovan McNabb, the second ovPrall pick in thfl l 'J99 NFL Draft.

Thn Irish have proven they can win thn big gallles al honw, but Bob Davie's biggest con­cnrn must bn gntling ovnr tho second-game jinx. In his first two s!la..'lons as head coach, Davit, has won both season opmrnrs at homn -only lo lost' the second game on the road to l,issnr upponents. This year, the test conrns against one of lhe best teams the Irish will faco this snmmn in No. 7 Michigan.

Sports Editor 

At Michigan and Notre Dame, this means one thing: rivalry week­end. The Wolverines and the Fighting Irish begin the football season with a knockdown, drag-out, no-holds-barred contest which separates the contenders from the pre­tenders for the national championship hunt. 
Well, at least Michigan does. 
The Fighting -in name only -Irish felt that starting the season in Ann Arbor was just too much stress for its young team to deal wHh. So Notre Dame just decided to schedule a not-so-powerful Kansas team ­without Danny Manning -to give itself a trial run before Michigan comes calling. 
Knute Hockne must be spinning in his grave. I gunss I can see what Notre Dame coach Bob Davie was thinking about when scheduling the Jayhawks. Likn Michigan, Kansas has blun uniforms. But all similari­ties end there. 
Although Notrn Dame played thn part of a fragile lamb in sdwduling the Jayhawks, it's firn~ that Notre Dame has no conlidnncn in itself. It really has no reason to feel good about its prospncts. 
The Irish haven't compntnd l'or the nation­al title in the past live years. I lnck, they droppnd their last two games to Michigan State, the other university in Michigan. 
But that's OK. Notrn Dame has hit its bad patches before. Hemmnber Gerry Faust'? But Notre Dame being a lackluster football team is not the reason that the Golden Dome has morn of a resemblance to a bronze pig. 
The fact is that Notre l>anw isn't quite the holier-than-thou program that it, or NBC, will have you bl'liovn. Forg<'t what. Hudy Huettiger might have told you. Tho truth ol' thr\ matt<~r is thal Kimb11rly Dunbar is morn of what tho Notn\ Damn program stands for. 
Free plane tickets. Kickbacks totaling thousands of dollars at a tinw. A child. All this and more can bo obtai,wd wlrnn joining tho Notre Damo football program. · . As for the annoying littln leprnchaun who dances around the fiold as if he had just exited tho pub, its rumored that tho pot full of' gold was also a gift from Dunbar, an nv1m exchange for the luck of' the Irish. 
I guess Dunbar didn't altnr Urn Notre Dame tradilion. She just brought dishonesty, kickbacks and cheating to a whole nnw levol.
