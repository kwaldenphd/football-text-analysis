"One student who graduated two years ago was assigned to care for an AIDS patient. She ex­pressed her concern to me about it, and surprisingly she was not worried about her own safety.

'Man learns aggression after birth' 
By ERIC M. BERGAMO

People are not born with ag­gression, but learn aggression when they are young. according to anthropologist Ashley Mon­tagu. 
Montagu spoke on the topic of human aggression during a lec­ture in the library auditorium last night. The lecture was the first in the Exxon,Distinguished Visit­ing Scholars Program and was sponsored by the anthropology department.

Montagu said that this aggres­sion is formed during childhood when the emphasis is on "beat­ing the child into obedience." The baby, when first born, has no idea of aggression and ·in­stead learns it through obedience. 
Montagu explained that pediatricians in the earlier part of the century advised that par­ents should never kiss or hold a child. 
sexual relations with male homosexuals. Women develop the disease in heterosexual rela­tions with men, according to Clausen. "No lesbian cases have been cited so far," he said. 
"Intravenous drug abuse and blood transfusions are other transmitting vehicles," added Clausen. 
"As far as saliva is concerned, it cannot transmit AIDS from domestic, social or work con­tacts. There is a possibility the disease is contracted through sexual kissing due to its more intimate contact," Clausen said.

"The experts of that time said that you never kiss a child at night when you send him to bed, you shake hands," Montagu said. 
Montagu said that people's re­sponsibility is "to make yourself over into what you ought to be and what you ought to be is, as a matter of fact, that you are nothing more than a deteriorated baby, who has all the potentiality for becoming a warm loving human being. It is your responsibility to make your­self over into what you ought to be and that is a warm loving human being." 
J-Board considers parietals 
By Rob Hennig 
Senior Staff Reporter 

Changes in the parietals policy are under consideration since being proposed at a Judicial Council meeting held this week. 
A committee headed by Stu­dent Senator Brian Holst, and in­cluding Judicial Coordinator Maria Cintron, Lewis Hall Presi­dent Kris Thompson, Student Senator John Bauer and Student Body Cabinet Member Bruce Lohman presented a tailored parietals policy to the Judicial Council. _ 
According to Holst, the pro­posed changes to DuLac include an extension of visitation hours to 12:30 a.m. on Sunday evenings, pushing back morning visitation time until I 0 a.m. during the mornings and elimin­ating "the possibility of suspen­sion or dismissal for parietals for first time offenders with a clean record." 
According to Cintron, the com­mittee will present and discuss the proposals at the next Student Senate meeting on Monday. Once finalized and approved by the Senate, "It will be presented to the CLC (Campus Life Coun· cil)," Cintron said. 
In other business, several council committees were formed. Brendan Judge will head the Legal Services committee. Currently, the committee is "try­ing to get a list of South Bend lawyers that would be willing to take legal cases" concerning cri­minal charges against students. said Cintron. According to Cintron, there is a need for such a service because the Legal Aid program of the Notre Dame Law School can only handle civil cases. 
Judicial Coordinator Cintron t;~lso announced her office hours. She will be available from 2 until 3 p.m. on every Monday, Wed­nesday and Friday and from II: 15 
a.m. until 12:15 p.m. on each Tuesday and Thursday in her of­fice on the second noor of Lafor­tune Student Center. 
would do in a situation where they might encounter an AIDS victim, she said. 
Mary Feeley of Saint Mary's Campus Ministry said, "At Saint Mary's we can make a statemnt about our own beliefs as the dis­ease comes closer to students and families. This is first and foremost." 
"The Church has not been helpful at supporting homosexuals. Few people in the Catholic Church are willing to speak out concerning homosexuality. AIDS victims have ·found support within the Gay Community,"' she said. 
Dr. Robert W. Clausen, M.D. Department of Biological Sciences University of Notre Dame, spoke about the medical 
aspect concerning AIDS. 

"Those people with an in­creased risk of developing AIDS have had thrush (a yeast infec­tion in the mouth), venereal dis­ease, an intravenous drug user, and older adults," he said. 
According to Clausen when the immune system has been ham­pered to the point where it is "down", there is an increased chance of contracting AIDS.

Congress cheers President Aquino after she addresses joint session 

Associated Press 
WASHINGTON Philippine President Corazon Aquino, in a speech that brought a shower of affection from a 
joint session of Congress, pledged yesterday to take up "the sword of war" if peacemaking with commu­nist rebels fails. 
Mrs. Aquino, in the seventh month of her leadership of a major U.S. ally which was led 
r 
r for more than 20 years by Fer­
r dinand Marcos, offered thanks for the role Congressr played in changing U.S. r policy toward her country. 
At the same time, Mrs. Aquino, widow of the assas­sinated Benigno Aquino, an opposition leader in the last years of Marcos, appealed for help to build "a new home for democracy, another haven for the oppressed." 
House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., D-Mass., said af­terwards, 'That's the finest speech I've heard in my 34 years in Congress." 
Members of the House and Senate, many wearing yellow roses symbolizing the color Mrs. Aquino chose for her presidential campaign, crowded the chamber. Scores of Filipino Americans were in the gallery crowd. 
Within hours of her speech, the House passed 203-197 a bill giving the Philippines a $200 million cash infusion to help deal with economic distress. The measure was sent to the Senate, where prospects for approval were uncertain. 
Some opponents sugges­ted the money be spent in­stead on improving U.S. mil­itary facilities at Subic Bay Naval Station and Clark Air Base. 
Mrs. Aquino underscored her policy of negotiating with the Communist New People's Army guerrilla movement but said, "I will not stand by and allow an insurgent leadership to spurn our offer of peace and kill our young soldiers and threaten our new freedom." 
"We face a communist in­surgency that feeds on eco­nomic deterioration, even as we carry a great share of the free world defenses in the Pacific," she said in her only reference to U.S. military bases in the Philippines. 
Invoking the name of Pres­ident Abraham Lincoln, Mrs. Aquino said, "I understand that force may be necessary before mercy. Like Lincoln, I don't relish it, yet I will do whatever it takes to defend the integrity and freedom of my country. 
"I must explore the path of peace to the utmost, for at its end, whatever disappoint­ment I meet there, is the moral basis for laying down the olive branch of peace and taking up the sword of war," she said. 
"Still, should it come to that, I will not waver from the course laid down by your great liberator," she said in another reference to Lincoln. 
Mrs. Aquino said the aim of the negotiations, under way in Manila, was to bring the in­surgents "down from the hills and, by economic progress and justice, show them that 
for  which  the  best­ 
intentioned among  them  
fight."

Tensions rise on eve of Schultz -Shevardnadze consultation 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON Secretaryof State George P. Shultz will confront Soviet Foreign Mini­ster Eduard A. Shevardnadze head-on today with a demand to free American reporter Nic­holas Daniloff, and is ready to cut short their summit planning session unless he gets a stafisfactory reply, U.S. officials said. 
In Moscow, however, Soviet leader Mikail S. Gorbachev yesterday denounced the cor­respondent for U.S. News &: World Report as a spy and suggested the United States had exploited the case to try to spoil superpower relations. 
As tensions rose, the Soviets exchanged barbs with the Reagan administration yesterday over a U.S. order that 25 Soviet diplomats as­signed to the United Nations leave the country by Oct. I. 
Shevardnadze, arriving at Andrews Air Force Base on the eve of the two-day meet­ing with Shultz, called the ex­pulsion illegal and also "a bad decision."­
In New York, the chief So­viet U.N. delegate, Alexander Belonogov, said the Soviets already had cut their mission to 2 18, which is I 0 below the demanded level.

But Bernard Kalb, the State Department spokesman, said Soviets holding visas were "well over the level of 2 18." He declined to give a precise count, and he accused the Soviets of disobeying the or­der, issued initially last March, by not providing the names of any departing diplomats. 
The U.S. spokesman, res­ponding to Gorbachev's statement on Daniloff, said the reporter was the victim of 
"contrived  charges,  a  
frameup,  and  there is no  
retreat from that."  

Kalb said the Daniloff case was Shultz' "priority" in the 
impending session with Shevardnadze.

here ot not making public com­ments about appointments," said Michael Loux, dean of the College of Arts and Letters. 
Notre Dame's faculty hand­book states that retired profes­sors are appointed to teach by a letter from the provost on a year­
to-year basis. The appointment must first be approved by the de­partment in which the professor teaches, then by the dean of the 
college and finally by the provost. 
Storey received a letter of ap­pointment to teach in the 1985­86 school year and expected to receive another appointment in 
1986 so he could continue to ad­vise the doctoral students who were studying under him. 
When Storey did not receive a letter of appoir..nent from the provost by May 1986, he con­tacted O'Meara, who was acting as chairman of the theology de­partment while McBrien was on sabbatical. O'Meara told Storey that he was not going to be ap­pointed to teach, but gave no reason for the University's deci­sion, Storey said. 
In July, Storey sent a letter to 
University President Father 
Theodore Hesburgh, asking him 
to overturn the decision and al­
low him to teach. 
Hesburgh's reply thanked 
Storey for his years of service to 
Notre Dame but did not state 
whether he could continue teach­
ing. 
Hesburgh was out of town and 
could not be reached for com­
ment yesterday. 
When Storey's students found 
out that he would not be teaching 
them, they complained to the 
theology department. McBrien, 
who returned from sabbatical in 
August 1986, negotiated the 
compromise that allowed Storey 
to teach this year. 
McBrien said he wanted the 
students who were studying un­
der Storey to finish their work 
with him. 
"My concern, and Professor 
Storey's concern, was for the stu­
dents that he was already under 
obligation to," McBrien said. 
McBrien added that he wasn't 
certain whether Storey would be 
allowed to continue teaching 
once those students completed 
tlleir work. 
McBrien said he did not know 
why a compromise was neces­
sary for Storey to continue teach­
ing. 
"Obviously, the change in the 
arrangement goes back to some­
thing that happened last year 
and I wasn't here last ·year," 
McBrien said.

"Like all beliefs and ideals we place a high value upon. it must be earned through a price paid by someone.

What I found out was that yes, there were mistakes being made, but the military should not have gotten all the bad press," he said.

Rams make big deal with Houston for rookie quarterback Jim Everett 
Associated Press 
ANAHEIM, Calif. -The Los An­geles Rams, who've had little success with the aging quarter­backs they've signed in recent years, yesterday acquired the rights to a promising young pas­ser, rookie Jim Everett. 
They paid a steep price for the acquisition of the rights to Everett, the former Purdue stan­dout who has been a contract holdout with the Houston Oilers this season. 
Los Angeles gave the Oilers Pro Bowl guard Kent Hill, the Rams' first picks in the draft for the next two years, their No. 5 pick in 1987 plus defensive end William Fuller for Everett, the third player selected in the 1986 NFL college draft. 
"We had to pay a healthy price, but we feel it's worth it" Rams Coach John Robinson said. "You look ahead to the next five years, the big stumbling block for the Rams was a quality quarterback. 
"Steve Bartkowski, Dieter Brock and Steve Oils are fine for this year, but each is in their 30s 
"We see Jim Everett as one of the young quarterbacks with a great future. We're anxious to get him here as soon as possible, but it's premature on how much he would be used this year," Rob­inson said. "He's coming into a great environment here with a number of proven people on of­fense and a strong defense." 
"He's a franchise-type guy," Bartkowski, the Rams starter this season, said of Everett. "They don't come along that often." 
"''m excited; it's probably the best thing ever to happen to me," Everett said in a conference call to the Rams' headquarters in 
Anaheim.  "I  know  the  team  is  
committed to winning.  It has a  
great coach.  

"There's no question in my mind I did the right thing. It's worked out in everyone's best in· terests." 
Everett indicated he doesn't expect lengthy negotiations with the Rams, saying, "We won't start talking until Monday as I under­stand it but I'll be in real soon." 
He said he's not concerned with the Rams' plans for him this year, commenting, "They have a fine quarterback in gartkowksi. and my only goal is to improve daily. The more I can learn from Bartkowski. the better off I'll be in the long run." · 
His holdout in Houston was "This is going to be interest­ing." Dcmoff said. "John is going 
to have to be fair. There's no rea­son for him to play games. He surely knows Jim's value ... But you have to give the Rams a lot or credit. They outsmarted the 49ers." 
Ladd Herzeg. the Oilers' gen­eral manager, said, "The last meeting that I had with Jim could tell he wanted to play right at first. Ami that probably wasn't going to happen here." 
In recent years, the Rams signed several veteran quarter­backs, but they had little suc­cess. Among the group were Joe Namath, Dan Pastorini, Bert Jones, the Canadian Football League veteran Brock, and Bartkowski. Although the Rams 
arc  2-0,  the  passing  of  
Bartkowski,  who played  for At­ 
lanta  and  Washington  last  

season, has been mediocre. 
The Kams had to outbid the San ~·rancisco 49ers for Everett. The 49ers, who lost quarterback Joe Montana for the season after back surgery this week, had of­fered both of their first-round picks next year, a second-round choice and nose tackle Manu Tuiasosopo. The Oilers were de­mamling Pro Bowl nose tackle Michael Carter.

Soccer team travels to face MSU, returns home Sunday vs. Tri-State 
By PETE GEGEN 
Assistant Sports t:ditor 
The 5-I Notre Dame soccer 
team looks to add two victories 
to its record this weekend. 
The team is in East Lansing. Mich., today for an afternoon contest against Michigan State. Then the team returns home Sunday to face Tri-State in a 1 
p.m. contest on Alumni Field. 
The Irish have been opening some eyes lately with their excel­lent play. The defense began the year with two straight shutouts and is allowing an average ofone goal a game: 
Meanwhile the play of the of­fense has been the biggest im­provement for Notre Dame. The team has scored an average of three goals a game, a one-goal improvement over last seasons' record-low average of two. 
The offense has been led by sophomore forward Bruce "Tiger" McCourt. McCourt has eight ~oals and three assists 
Bosox complete sweep of Brewers 
Associated Press 
BOSTON -Rich Gedman and Marty Barrett drove in two runs apiece with bases·loaded singles in a six-run tllird inning as tile Boston Red Sox rolled to a 7-I victory over tile Milwaukee Brewers last night. completing a through six games, and he re­corded the team's first hat-trick since Rich Herdegen scored three against Valparaiso in 1984. 
To contrast with last season's scoring production, McCourt's 19 points is only six shy ofequal­ing last season's leading-scorer Joe Sternberg's total of 25. 
McCourt is joined in the scoring department by sopho­more Randy Morris and fresh­man Dave Augustyn on the front line, and Sternberg and fresh­man Rolfe Behrje in the midfield. 
The Irish enter the game having tied the Spartans in their last two matches. While not much is known about them this season, Head Coach Dennis Grace noted that the Spartans played very well in a 3-I loss to Indiana last week. 
"They did something against Indiana that we didn't do, and that's score a goal," noted Grace. 'Tm looking forward to seein_g what we can do against them." 
· The game against Tri-State was moved from October 30 to 
four-game series sweep. 
With their 16th victory in tlleir last 19 starts and tlleir 12tl1. straight at llome, the Red Sox hiked their record to 90-57, going 33 games over .500 for the first time since Oct. 2, 1978. 
The Red Sox also increased their American League East lead to I0 games over idle New York and Toronto, reducing Boston's magic number for clinching the title to six.

The Tri-State contest pits coach against former player. Dan Coughlin, former keeper for the Irish, is now the coach of the Trojans. 
Notre Dame will be without the services of three of its players this weekend. Senior forward Bill Gross is out for a week with an injured shoulder suffered in_t!:l~ 
Michigan game. The injury is similar, though less serious than the one suffered by captain Jim Flynn at the beginning of the season. Flynn is about two weeks away from returning to action. 
The keeper spot has been hit particularly hard with injuries this season. Following Flyn.n to the bench is sophomore Kevin Mayo, who broke his thumb in practice this week. 
With Mayo out for three to four weeks, Tim Hartigan has moved up to the backup-keeper slot. Grace noted that freshman keeper Dan Lyons is also ready to play. 
Bruce Hurst 12-7, breezed to his fourth consecutive victory and IOth complete game of the season. Hurst scattered five hits, struck out I I and walked two. 
Milwaukee starter Pete Vukovich, I -3, took the loss.

Full slate of games on tap as '86 interhall football begins 
By CHRIS DALLAVO 
Sports Writer 
As football fever continues its reign on the Notre Dame campus, fans have another cause for excitement. The 1986 Men's lnterhall Football season is about to begin, with a full slate of games scheduled for this Sun­day at Stepan Field. 
Alumni Hall, the 1985 lnterhall Football champion, will once again be a strong contender in the Leahy division. Despite losing many key players, Alumni coach Paul Loughlin remains cautiously optimistic. 
"We just have to take things one week at a time," he said. "No one really knows what to expect until after everyone's played." 
Alumni begins its defense at 2 
p.m. against newly-formed Pangborn, who had combined with Fisher to compete in past years. Other Leahy Division games pit Stanford against Holy Cross and Zahm against Cavanaugh. Both contests start at .3 p.m. 
The Parseghian division will probably feature the year's most 
intense  competition.  Perennial  
powers  Morrissey,  Dillon  and  
Flanner  will  all  field  strong  

teams, while Off-Campus will try to rebound from their 0·5 record of last year. 
This week's best game should be the clash between Dillon and Flanner. Charlie Rice, the head

.3-2 loss in double overtime to drop their season record to 1·.3, the Irish players had nothing to be ashamed of in their defeat. 
When time ran out in regula· tion, the Irish and the Huskies were tied I· I, with Notre Dame's lone goal coming on a 40-yard drive by Stephanie Giggetts. The senior forward scored unassis­ted after beating four defenders in an open field breakaway. 
Notre Dame's all-time leading scorer, Corinne DiGiacomo, tied the match at 2·2 with only twenty seconds left in the first ten­minute overtime period to keep the Irish hopes alive. Northern

Illinois had scored just thirty seconds into the period. 
Only three minutes passed in the second OT before the Huskies slipped a goal by junior goalie M.J. Beetel. The Irish failed to score and the match ended in a disappointing .3-2 final. 
Although the Irish tired in the second half of regulation, Coach Jill Lindenfeld said she felt a change in her players when they began the extra periods. 
"We had a breakthrough with the girls going into the over­time," she said. "I felt a real desire to win in all of them." 
Lindenfeld stressed that NIU dominated the match, but the Irish took their time and played better late in the match. 
"Our girls played with poise all through the game," she said. 'They put their hearts and guts into the extra minutes on a field that was fourteen yards wider than we are used to playing on." 
The Irish look to improve their record this weekend with away matches against Ohio today and Kent State on Saturday.

Irish look for first '86 victory against Spartans 
By MARTY STRASEN 
Assistant Sports Editor 
EAST LANSING, Mich. -At some point early tomorrow evening. there will be a tough college football team with a winless record of 0-2. 
That's what is at stake when 20th­ranked Notre Dame takes on Michigan State tomorrow afternoon at Spartan Stadium in front of a sellout crowd of 76,000 and a CBS national-television au­dience. 
,.. The Spartans held down the No. 20 slot in the AP preseason poll but dropped a heartbreaker, 20-I 7, to Arizona State in their season opener and lost the position to the Irish, who were impressive in a 24-23 loss to third-ranked Michigan last Saturday. Now, Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz finds himself looking for his first Irish victory against a team which finished 7-4 last year, had the nation's leading rusher and has lost only 14 times in 89 home openers. "Had we won the (Michigan) game it would have been a tremendous morale boost for us," Holtz said. "Now I'm not sure what our reaction's going to be going into Michigan State. "For the first time, you don't know how a football team is going to react on the road. I think this one is going to react very positively and play very well. (Michigan State) was picked to be in the Top 20 preseason and I can see why. They are impressive." Spartan head coach George Perles has led his troops to back-to-back winning seasons for the first time since Darryl Rogers did it in 1977 and 1978, and this year State looks to break into the Big I 0 conference's elite -usually meaning Mic­higan and Ohio State. One thing's for sure, however. The team coming away with an 0-2 record could have an uphill battle to fight in 1986. 
Michigan State's offense vs. Notre Dame's defense: 
If the name Lorenzo White is an un­familiar one, you probably haven't been following the Heisman Trophy race very closely. Remember the hype over Auburn's Bo Jackson? White was the man who beat out last year's Heisman winner in the rushing department. picking up 
I,908 yards for the Spartans to lead the nation. 
In 1986, Perlesjust might have a solid passing attack to complememt the ex­plosiveness of the 5-1 I, 204-pound 
Each week, the Observer sports staff, a random student picked by the sports editor and some well-known figur<> in the Notre Dame community predict the outcome of the week's major college football games. Records are compiled as to how each per­son does against the spread. In other words, it isn't enough to pick the winner of a given game. The person must pick the winner and give the underdog points. Home team is in CAPS.

White, who led the Big I 0 in touchdowns 
last year with I 7 and rushed for better than 220 yards in four games. 
Senior quarterback Dave Yarema is coming off the best game of his career in the loss to the Sun Devils, completing 26 passes in 33 attempts for 258 yards. His .577 completion percentage is topped by only six other Big I 0 signal-callers with 500 or more attempts. 
"They have the same ingredients on offense that the University of Michigan does," said Holtz. "They have a good of­fensive line, a great tailback, a good blocking fullback in (Bobby) Morse, and the development of Yarema means a lot to them. He's a very accurate passer, can scramble. finds the ooen receiYer and is 

Lorenzo White 
oblivious to the pass rush. 
"Offensively, they're an awful lot like Michigan except that Lorenzo White, as everybody says, is the greatest running back in the entire country. I think you have to concede that Lorenzo White is going to gain a lot of yardage. What we don't want to do is give him any more than he deserves." 
A lack of targets shouldn't be a problem for the 6-3 Yarema, who has a fine re­ceiving corps returning. Senior nanker Mark Ingram led the team in 1985 with 34 receptions and split end Andre Rison pulled down 19. Morse, whose father, Jim, captained the 1954 Notre Dame foot­ball team, is also a receiving threat com­ing out of the backfield. Junior tight end Mike Sargent played in all 12 games last season, catching only two passes as he was used mainly in a blocking role. 
In the trenches, however, the Irish should find the going a little easier. Last weekend, the front line of tackles Robert Banks (left), Marty Lippincott (nose) and Wally Kleine (right) was outweighed sig­nificantly against the Wolverines. 
Tomorrow, Michigan State sends three returning starters on the field in junior center Patrick Shurmur, senior guard Doug Rogers and sophomore tackle Tony Manda rich. To stop the Irish from getting to Yarema, big performances will be needed from sophomore Mark Hill and 
junior David Houle, two newcomers to the offensive line. 
Besides stopping White, or at least slowing him down, the key for Notre Dame will be putting some pressure on Yarema in the passing situations. Outside linebacker Dave Butler is back in the lineup and Cedric Figaro could be blitzing occasionally from the other outside spot. 
Senior captain Mike Kovaleski was named the Associated Press Midwest de­fensive player of the week for his efforts at the inside backer spot against the Wol­verines. Kovaleski was in on a game-high 
I 7 tackles in the contest. 
Notre Dame's offense vs. Michigan State's defense: 
Heading into last weekend's Michigan game, the big question was whether Notre Dame could move the ball against one of the better defenses in the nation. After picking up 455 total yards on a myriad of formations and plays -from wishbones to split-backs and from roll­outs to options-the offensive unit is now faced with another question: 
Was last week's success a result of a hyped-up group of players in their first game under a new head coach, or can the Irish continue to march upfield at wiW? 
"Our weapon is to control the football,·· Holtz said. "We would like to continue to do a lot of different things. I know some people think it's a sort of ny-by-night op­eration but it really isn't. There's a lot of correlation in our offense. 
"I am impressed with Mark Green with the ball in his hands and I think Anthony Johnson and Braxston (Banks) can run pretty well. Pernell Taylor really worked hard and, still, Tim Brown showed that he is just an all-around great player:: 
Steve Beuerlein also answered some important questions in the Michigan game. throwinn for 263 yards on a 2 1­of-33 completion ratio, behind the protection of an impressive, young offen­sive line. Senior center Chuck Lanza was named offensive lineman of the game for the Irish. 
A leg injury will sideline fullback Frank Starns for approximately two weeks. ac­cording to Holtz, which means Taylor could be one tired fullback after tomor­row's contest. 
The strength of the Michigan State defense lies beyond the line of scrim­mage, where a veteran linebacking corps and an impressive secondary will be trying to put the lid on Beuerleirl's passing attack. 
All-America candidate Shane Bullough and Tim Moore, who combined for 275 tackles last season, head the linebacking squad along with sophomore Kurt Lar­son. 
Junior Todd Krumm, who paced the team with four interceptions in 1985, is one of three returning players in the de­fensive backfield. Seniors Dean Altobelli (strong safety) and Paul Bobbitt (free safety) also will have their hands full with speedy Irish receivers like Brown, Reggie Ward, Milt Jackson and Alvin Miller. 
But for the Spartans to slow down the Irish offense, a defensive line with only one returning starter will have to come through. Left tackle Mark Nichols (6-2, 
238) is the lone returnee, while David Wolff and John Budde move from part­time roles in 1985 to spots at tackle and end, respectively. The other end position will be occupied by a Freshman, James Szymanski. 
"Defensively, they play something like the 46," Holtz said. "They line up all dif­ferent ways and twist and stunt and create an awful lot of bad plays. They never let you establish a rhythm on offense and it's very, very effective. 
"It's going to be a little difficult for our offensive linemen because it's whole new blocking schemes and a whole new basic concept. (Michigan State) really pursues well and they don't make a lot of mental errors."
