Success: getting there means planning it out 
Success...the definition means something different to each individual, but everyone wants it. 
Webster's says success is "the achievement of something desired, intended, or attempted." It is the realization of an objective. 
But, how do you obtain that elusive "someth­ing?" 
Success does seem to come easily to some (at great envy to the rest of us), but this is rare and usually short-term. The "realization of an objective" involves planning, maybe even a goal. 
Much of the mystique or excitement of suc­cess disappears when hard work or planning is mentioned. In monetary terms (not the only goal one can set by any means), you can spend your entire life playing the lottery, hoping for the big jackpot or you can develop a plan which would help you achieve the same financial se­curity over a longer period of time. 
Winning the "lottery of life" may be exciting, but it may never happen. The odds for success become greater when you can take destiny into your own hands. Realizing an objective can be exhilarating in its own right, even without the hype of instant success. 
The problem with achieving success comes not on the path to that goal, but in figuring out what that path is. 
Picture trying to reach a destination with no road signs or maps to guide you; the same is true of the path to success. Without a clearly marked path to follow, the destination may never be reached. 
Take a long range objective, just one -no, not later -but right now at the dining hall. Think of that "something" which determines success for you. Don't look at the objective of the person sitting next to you, but think about what career, financial standing, community involvement you think you can put under that "something" category. 
None of us are sure of future outcomes, or even if down the road we will want to achieve the goal we want now, but until we set out down a path we won't even be able to reach a cros­sroad. 
To use yet another cliche, "you can't win the race until you get out of the gate." The trick in establishing a goal plan of action is being specific in what the "something" is. 
Right now your overall goal for "success" probably is not specific. With the overall objec­tive in mind, take a step back from that and determine what immediately preceded that final outcome. 
Picture yourself in that final situation and

then what you were doing immediately prior to that. If you don't know, find out. 
The next step is to work backwards further and examine that secondary plate'ilu. Deter­mine how you can achieve that level of "success," each step becoming more and more specific and closer to reality. 
This process continues until you reach your current standing as a college student. Ask, "What can I do tomorrow to reach the next step to my overall goal?" 
Goal setting not only is helpful for the big picture of ultimate success, but also for everyday living. "What are my self-imposed deadlines for getting that research paper done next week? What are my priorities for tonight?" 
Unlike travel, going from point A to point B probably will not follow a straight line when it comes to success. 
The goal setting process can be tedious to some, downright scary to others. But without an objective to reach and an outlet to answer the above questions, "success" and that "something" you seek are in the hands of little pingpong balls in a lottery.

'controversial' results 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeut­ter conceded Monday that win­ning congressional approval of a far-reaching free trade pact with Canada will "require a lot of effort" on the part of sup­porters. 
Despite initial optimism ex­pressed by Canadian and U.S. officials, Yeutter said obtain­ing approval of the agreement might be difficult, particularly over some of its provisions -in­cluding giving Canadians access for the first time to oil from Alaska's North Slope. 
But he told reporters that, in the end, "this is a package that should sell itself and will sell itself." 
The accord, completed after 16 months of negotiations and just before a midnight Satur­day deadline, calls for an elim­ination of all tariffs and most other trade barriers between the two countries by Jan. 1, 1999. 
It would create the world's largest open market. But as fuller details of the ac­

cord began to surface Monday, key U.S. lawmakers voiced skepticism over the prospects for quick approval. 
The pact must be approved by both Congress and the Canadian Parliment to take ef­fect. 
Senate Finance Committee Chai:r:man Lloyd Bentsen said in a statement that it was "ob­vious that a lot of the major points have not been resolved." 
"Up to this point, . . . all we've been hearing about are 
U.S. concessions," Bentsen added. 
Sen. Max Baucus, a Finance Committee member, said nei­ther the administration nor the Canadians should engage "in cheerleading tactics to build support for this agreement." 
The accord would give U.S. businesses greater opportuni­ties in Canada by lifting scores of trade and investment re­strictions. At the same time, it ., 
gives Canadian companies greater access to U.S. markets. 
With two-way trade last year of $135 billion, the United States and Canada are the world's largest trading partners.

Earthquake aftershocks continue to rattle, damage Southern California 



Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -After­shocks continued to rattle Southern California Monday, damage estimates jumped to $125 million and Gov. George Deukmejian said he might call a special session of the Legisla­ture to approve earthquake aid. 
The most recent of more than two dozen serious aftershocks following Thursday's major earthquake struck at 5 p.m. Monday, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale, the seismology laboratory at the California In­stitute of Technology reported. 
In a report to Deukmejian, state disaster officials gave a preliminary damage estimate 
of  $117.3  million  damage  to

There was an additional $8.1 million damage to public prop­erty, said Tom Mullins of the State Office of Emergency Ser­vices. 
The Republican governor asked President Reagan and the Federal Emergency Man­agement Agency to declare a major disaster in Los Angeles and Orange counties, which would allow federal disaster relief such as individual grants up to $5,000, temporary housing help and low-interest loans to rebuild homes and businesses. 
Meanwhile, rubble was being cleared Monday from the downtown Whitter area, des­cribed as looking "like down­town Beirut."
