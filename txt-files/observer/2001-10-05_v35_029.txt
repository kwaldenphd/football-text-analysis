Stadium expansion a mixed bag 
. Repairs, lawsuit cast a shadow over additional seats and other new features 
By SCOTT BRODFUEHRER Assistant News Editor 
Four years after the expanded Notre Dame Stadium was first opened, work is still being done on the Stadium to repair con­struction defects. and the University has filed a lawsuit against the architect and the general contractor of the Stadium seeking damages for the repairs. 
Although the repairs and the lawsuit were not part of the University's original plan for the Stadium, the building's function­ality has not been affected. and University officials have been pleased with the expanded Stadium. 
The University became aware of problems with the Stadium at the first home game of the 1997 season on Sept. 6 against Georgia Tech, when flaws in the sewage output system caused a flood in the Stadium, the Galvin Life Sciences Center and the Computing Center and Math Building. The flooding caused more than $400,000 in damages. 
The University's property insurer, St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company, issued the University $371,755.10 for the damages. Damages not covered · by the insurance company were paid by the University. 
"Loss not recovered by insur­ance has to be covered by the University," said Director of Public Relations and Information Dennis Moore. 
In addition to the flooding, problems began to develop in the Stadium after use. including cracked concrete, connection failure, failure of railing post connections and other significant problems that did not pose a safety risk to fans inside the structure. They were problems the University decided to address. 
Last year, Notre Dame officials hired other contractors to per­form repairs in the Stadium, the majority of which were complet­ed before this season. It also filed a lawsuit against Ellerbe Becket, the architect. and Casteel Construction, the general con­tractor. 
The University is now paying for repairs to the Stadium but expects that a judgement from the lawsuit will eventually pay for the repairs. 
David Kirkner, a Notre Dame civil engineering and geological sciences associate professor, said that when defects are discovered in a new building, the new owner normally hires an outside consulting firm to investigate the building, discover any additional problems and generate a list of

Fulfilling a lifetime dream a world away from home 

By KATIE SEROKA 
News Writer 
Jenalee Almes grew up in a world of poverty. Iler family in the Philippines didn't have a telephone or a computer. Their house frequently flood­ed. In 1997, technology and luxuries seemed like a dream for the Saint Mary's freshman. 
"I was just always fascinated with it (the phone] since my family didn't have one," Almes said about the few phone calls her parents made at a local store. "When I was younger I didn't always understand what they were saying, but l was excited anyway." 
An even more impossible dream for a young girl in the Philippines was a higher edu­cation. 
But four years and incredible journey later, Alm es is a high school graduate and on track to graduate from Saint Mary's in 2005. 

Her opportunities stem from the hard work of a Notre Dame graduate and her own persistence and faith. 
Poverty at home 
In the Philippines, the Almes family frequently had trouble finding work. Her father had to travel as far away as Saudi Arabia for employment. Her mother and aunt waited tables at Subic Bay Naval Base which was located in Almes home­town -Olongapo City. 
It was here that the two women met and became friends with two Americans, a man whom was serving in the 
U.S. Navy at Subic and his wife who lived with him on the base. Vince and P.J. Converse would later become Almes' lifeline to a better education in the United States. 
The Converses remained at Subic until 1991 when a vol­cano eruption closed the base and the American's moved away. Although they were sep­arated by thousands of miles, the two families kept in touch. 
Through the years, Almes spoke with the Converses about typical things like school. It was during one of those conversations years later that Vince Converse asked the 15-year-old Almes to attend school 'in Arizona, where his family now lived. 
Ile knew how intelligent she was, and that an education in the United States would be more beneficial than one in the Philippines. 
When Converse worked in the Philippines he helped edu­cate several of his Filipino workers but even with this boost they still lived in pover­ty. Converse hoped that by educating Alnrns in America, she could move up economi­cally.

Encountering Christ 

Last semester I took "Christianity and World Religions". It focused on open dialogues between Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam. The first paper assignment we had sev­eral options, one was to discuss prayer in our personal lives. 
I wrote about learning prayers by rote as a child and how I had changed my outlook toward prayer as I grew older. I wrote how I made prayer part of my daily life by thanking God for the smallest of things and asking Him for help 

when I needed it. I wrote 
Angela Campos ...
about the charismatic 
retreat I experienced before 
my confirmation -how it 
changed my outlook on 
Lab Tech 

being Christian and being 
Catholic. 
My confirmation retreat was the spring of my sophomore year in high school. That was six years ago. It's ironic because, although I helped team confirmation retreats as a junior in high school and .as a sophomore at Notre Dame helped lead the con­firmation retreat at Little Flower Parish. I hadn't been a participant on a retreat since my sophomore year in high school. 
. ,Six year-s. That's a long time. 
A lot has happened in six years. I've lived in Indiana the better part of three of them, worked the last four summers and run myself ragged physically and emotionally. Now don't get me wrong, I love Notre Dame and I love all of the activities I'm in. But there are some times when you do too much and there's only so much you can take by yourself. You've got to give God the rest. 
So, when I was a freshman three years ago, I was talking with a friend about retreats. I had missed both of Badin's freshman retreats and was trying to experience a retreat at Notre Dame. I was trying to do everything my fresh­man year. My friend told me that one of the retreats that I should try to go on before I grad­uated was the NDE. 
So me, being the hyper freshman I was decid­ed I wanted to go on one. I had no idea what an NDE was, I just knew it was a retreat and I wanted a retreat experience. I thought I need­ed it then. My friend kept saying, "You'll go on an NDE when you need it," and at the time I didn't understand thatI needed to wait. 
NDE stands for Notre Dame Encounter with Christ Retreat. I participated on NDE No. 67 last weekend. And to tell you the truth, my friend was right -I went when I needed it. We walked to Fatima Retreat Center and left the rest of campus on the other side of the lake. We got to know each other with an ice-breaker and then split into small groups. We listened to talks. We joked about Diet Coke addictions and "f-words". We had fun. My small group was (and still is) awesome! The NDE Team was there for us -they were so great. 
I can't put my emotions into words that would do justice to the experience. Thank you to everyone who was on the retreat -you made it so special. Thank you to everyone who helped out -it meant the world to me.

LSU women describe Playboy experience 
BATON ROUGE, La. 

Partying at night in Los Angeles with Playboy magazine owner Hugh Hefner and catching a ride around Atlanta in a limousine are perks not every Louisiana State University stu­dent will experience. 
However, veterinary medicine senior Colleen has had the opportuni­ty for such privileges while modeling for Playboy. 
"The people at Playboy are the best people that I've ever worked for," she said. "They never make you do any­thing that you don't want to." 
Colleen was one of four University students who appeared in the October 2001 "Girls of the SEC" issue of Playboy. She said she did not want her last name in the issue or The Reveille for privacy reasons. 

"It's a way to prevent people from calling or getting in touch with you," she said. 
Colleen said she got started with Playboy when a local photographer sent pictures he shot of her to the magazine. 
"Within a week, they flew me to Atlanta for a photo shoot," she said. 
She has appeared in the February 2001 College Girls issue and the May 2001 Book of Lingerie issue. 
"[Playboy] is a whole different 
world," she said. "It's like a fraternity or sorority. Once you're in, you're in for life. And, as long as I don't do them wrong, they will find me work." 
She said she went to the tryouts for the October "Girls of the SEC" issue because she wanted to see if she could make it in the magazine again. 
"I went to see if it was a fluke that I had made it in the fi.rst two times," she said. "I wanted to see if I could do it again." 
Colleen went to the shoot and saw two of her best friends. Elise and Brittney, there. Playboy decided to group the three together for a photo. 
She said her friends did not feel comfortable shooting the pictures nude, so they decided to pose in bathing suits. Colleen had posed nude before. 
HARVARD UNIVERSITY 
Anthrax research gains attention 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 
As national fears about bioterrorism grow in the wake of the recent terrorist attacks, two Harvard University anthrax researchers have found their work thrust unex­pectedly into the spotlight. Anthrax, a bacterial disease that infects livestock and normally poses some risk to humans, is considered one of a number of potential bio­logical weapons. Inhaled anthrax spores kill 90 percent of humans within days of infection. Presley professor of microbiology and molecular genetics R. John Collier. who has done research on the proteins that allow anthrax to infect cells, said he has received about 25 calls from news organizations in the last few weeks. "It's certainly much more attention than I'm used to," he said. But why has anthrax specifically entered the spotlight? Dr. Luciana Borio, a fellow at the Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian Biodefense Studies, said anthrax spores survive successfully once released, and "the size of the spores are perfect for inhalation." That makes it a perfect weapon for bioterrorists.

Fund-raising campaign faces change 
EVANSTON, Ill. 

While the smoke may have cleared from the skylines of New York and Washington, companies nationwide are still reeling from the negative economic repercus­sions of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Universities across the United States, including Northwestern Universities, are finding that they are not immune to the turmoil plaguing businesses. Suddenly forced to rethink fund­raising campaigns, universities are realizing that dona­tions they counted on in the past may instead be divert­ed towards relief efforts. And with a large portion of their endowments invested in the volatile stock market, many institutions are cautiously reanalyzing their investment strategies. But even in these times of relative economic hardship, some schools are finding ways to aid the victims of the attacks. In Evanston, university offi­cials say that although the Campaign NU fund-raising drive continues on track to reach its $1.4 billion goal by August 2003, no one can predict how today's economic conditions will affect tomorrow's financial hopes.

Abroad applications 
move to Internet 
By MARIBEL MOREY Assistant News Editor 
Notre Dame's International Study Programs have stream­lined the application process and moved it to the Internet. Rather than filling out several different paper forms for various pro­grams, students will now fill out just one online form. 
"Applications have been climb­ing. We've been letting students apply to one or more programs and we don't want to stop them," said Thomas Bogenschild, direc­tor of the International Study Programs. "We think they should be able to apply to any programs they want." 
Students would normally request a separate application for each program, leaving the International Study Programs inundated with papers. 
"We had 886 applications last year [not including the London program). That's 24,000 pieces of paper," he said. "We simply were overwhelmed and had no staff to take care of it." 
The office also wanted to make it easier for students to fill out the application electronically. 
However, some students who applied online for the first time this fall would beg to differ. Applicants meeting the Oct. 1 deadline for spring semester programs in sites such as Mexico and Greece tested the new sys­tem. 
"It was a horrible experience," said Vanessa Reinhart, junior government major, after apply­ing for the Puebla, Mexico pro­gram. "There were times I couldn't log in." 
James Durkin, junior econom­ics major, felt the same way after applying for the program in Monterrey, Mexico. 
"It's just an unnecessary has­sle," he said. "The hard copy is a lot better element because you get a better grasp [of what you're doing]." 
The students disagree, howev­er, on the future of this new online method. 
"People like me aren't gonna want to go the online way," said Durkin. 
Although Reinhart herself did not have a positive experience, she is more optimistic about future students' responses. "It's the first time [online applications are used} and it's going to take some time to get the bugs out. With this new system, you can see the status of your application and if anything has changed." 
The office is moving towards a much more efficient method in dealing with the increased stu­dent interest to go abroad. 
"This is utilizing the latest technology and eventually this type will be used by many offices on campus," Bogenschild said. "It's all digital information at our fingertips." 
Students no longer have to repeatedly write their names on forms because the system online already identifies the applicant through his/her login informa­tion. 
This new system, however, might make it too easy for stu­dents to apply for myriad pro­grams that they normally would not have if separate forms were necessary for each. 
"But it might even bring a bet­ter distribution," Bogenschild said. "So maybe if one of these people signs up for Innsbruck in one of those whims -yeah, I'll take them if they have what it takes." 
From an administrative stand­point, the office for International Study Programs can now focus more on what students actually say instead of organizing the files around the office. 
"Instead of shuffling through piles of papers and serving as file clerks, we can do our job," Bogenschild said.

WASHINGTON 
Florida's anthrax case raised 
new questions about whether 
there would be enough medica­
tion for sick Americans if bioter­
rorists ever attack. 

There are enough antibiotics for anthrax in a federal stockpile to treat 2 million people for 60 days, Tommy Thompson, the nation's health secretary, said Thursday. 
Also in storage are other antibiotic tablets, streptomycin and gentamicin for the plague, for instance. 
Millions more tablets are 
available under a backup plan 
that places drug companies 
under contract to ship all their 
inventory in an emergency. 

"That's an important compo­nent," stressed Dr. Margaret Hamburg, who helped set up the stockpile under the Clinton administration. "You don't nec­essarily need to have a ware­house full of all the drugs you might need for the long haul. You need to have a mechanism to ensure backfilling of supplies as they're utilized." 
That may not be necessary ­four companies make one of the antibiotics that can treat anthrax, and local pharmacies always have a lot on hand. noted Jerry Hauer, a New York City bioterrorism specialist who advises Thompson. 
Of more concern is the highly contagious smallpox, for which there is no treatment: If small­pox ever surfaces, the govern­ment has 15.4 million doses of smallpox vaccine in storage and would ship them to the affected area not to help the already sick, but to keep the people around them from catching it. An addi­tional 40 million doses are on order, but won't start arriving until late next year. 
There are 280 million Americans. however. In a panic situation, who would ensure that limited supplies of drugs and vaccines are distributed to the people who really need them,

not just the rich or top politi­cians? 
Thompson assured senators this week that no member of the Cabinet or Congress would get their own special stockpile. 
"It's going to be given to the people who need it in the city that has the greatest need," Hauer said. "You've got to turn it over to the locals. They've got to be able to distribute it in the city." 
New York, for instance, has set up 300 potential distribution points. The city was supposed to practice how such distribution would work on Sept. 12, a drill canceled for obvious reasons. But if an outbreak was big enough that all those sites need­ed to open -more likely, only a few dozen would be needed, Hauer stressed -the city would need 40,000 workers to hand out medications. 
· Why so many? The antibiotics are stored in huge bottles, meaning doses for each person would have to be counted out by hand. 
"One of the dumbest things I've seen was in the previous administration, this decision to buy bulk antibiotics rather than blister packs," Hauer said. 
But bioterrorism experts still don't agree how smallpox vac­cine should be given out. Some say only people who have had contact with the sick should be vaccinated, while others say that entire cities where smallpox was found would need inoculations, Hauer said. 
No one will be vaccinated in advance out of fear of bioterror­ism because smallpox is a live vaccine and thus is very risky to anyone with a weak immune system, he explained. 
That aside, no matter how ready the government is to help, it can't unless local hospitals spot an outbreak and call the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -fast. 
That happened Thursday when a Florida state lab worker recently trained by CDC about anthrax symptoms tested a patient's blood and sounded the alarm that he had anthrax. Such . tests might never have been done before the Sept. 11 terror­ists attacks heightened doctors' awareness, said CDC director Jeffery Koplan.

"everything under the sun" that is wrong ·with the building. 
Problems with the Stadium are detailed in 20 pages of a civil complaint filed in St. Joseph County Circuit Court. The docu­ment lists problems with cracked concrete in the concourse and ramp floor. defects in shear walls that support forces due to wind and crowd sway, tie beam con­nections that transfer forces to the ground and expansion joints that allow for the concrete to contract or expand due to heat being inadequately short. 
The Stadium also has problems with metal corrosion and sealant defects, according to the 1999 complaint. 
According to Kirkner, the Stadium's problems are unusual for a regular construction project because construction problems generally occur when an archi­tect's design specifications are not followed by construction workers. ·while the Stadium has construction-related problems, there are also many problems in the design, such as portions of the Stadium being unable to resist loads described by regula­tions. 
"Some of these problems are not construction comments; they were designed incorrectly," Kirkner said. "That's rather unusual because there are codes and practices that architects must follow when designing a building. The usual problems are construction problems, when workers don't build it properly."

"Alumni are very pleased that they have additional seats." Lennon said. "The Athletic Department has been very responsive to our needs." 
Other groups also benefited from the addition of seats, which allowed all full-time faculty and staff to have the opportunity to purchase two season tickets. 
"Basically, we have everybody' sitting up there but the students," said Jim Fraleigh, assistant ath­letic director for ticketing, about the upper level seating. 
According to Fraleigh, the added seating has increased from two to four tickets the num­ber of tickets that alumni may apply for and has guaranteed four tickets to two parents games each year. 
"Previously. they were limited to two tickets per game, but allowing them to apply for four ticket.c; allows them to bring their families to the games and puts an emphasis on family," said Fraleigh. 
The renovation and expansion of the Stadium doubled the amount of locker room space for the football team and prompted the team to use the Stadium lock­er room on a daily basis for prac­tices and not just on game days. 
"Historically we dressed for practice in the Joyce Center. but sometime during the construc­tion process, we took a look at having players dress in the Stadium all the time," said John Heisler, associate athletic direc­tor for media relations. "You would have had to see the previ­ous locker room to understand this, but it was nothing to write home about. Going in there, you would have no idea it was Notre Dame." 
The current locker room is the exact opposite of the one in the Joyce Center and is something not only to write home about, but a locker room that has appeared on national television. 
According to Russell Gagnon, director of Stadium personnel. the expanded Stadium has made it easier for fans to enter the build.,ing on game days. 
"In a way, things arc much easier -not the addition of guests because more people means more work, but with the re-configuration of the gates, we can get more people in much quicker than we used to," said Gagnon. . 
In addition to the locker room and easier access to the Stadium, the expansion and renovation added a new press box, more concession stands and rest room facilities an<l handicapped access. 
While the expanded Stadium is extremely popular with most fans. the modification of former football coach Rockne's original design was not popular with some Stadium ushers. 
"One usher quit," Gagnon said. "He said Knute Rockne desiilled it and we've made it different and he didn't want to work here anymore ... Rockne built the sta­dium for 60,000 fans at a time when games were drawing 20,000, he was thinking ahead and stated his intention to build an expansion to seat 100,000 fans. Rockne himself would have been the first to decide to expand the Stadium."

NEWYORK 
The flag-draped casket rode atop a lone fire truck Thursday, taking Capt. Terence Hatton past his two families -his fellow fire­fighters and his pregnant wife, carrying the child he will never hold. 
Hatton, 41, was remem­bered at a funeral Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral as a hero and role model. His wife did not discover she was pregnant until after Hatton died in the rescue effort at the World Trade Center. 
"Terry looked like Gary Cooper -until he put on a fire helmet," recalled Timothy Brown, a longtime friend and the supervisor of the city Office of Emergency Management. "Then he looked better." 
For three weeks, there have been seemingly end­less memorials honoring the lost -from New York, Pennsylvania and Washington to the New Jersey shore and Long Island. On one Saturday alone, there were 16. 
Each day brings new mourning. 
As another service Thursday, thousands packed into a Madison Square Garden theater to honor the 7 4 Port Authority employees who were lost during the attack. 
"These have been the saddest of days," said Lewis Eisenberg, chairman of the Port Authority. "But they have been days of heroism and steadfast determina­tion." 
At Hatton's funeral, a let­ter from President Bush praising his service was read. The 6-foot-4 firefight­er, the son of a retired New York fire captain, was eulo­gized by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. 
Hatton's wife, Beth Petrone-Hatton, has worked as Giuliani's per­sonal assistant for 17 years, and Giuliani officiated at 
the Hattons' wedding at the 
mayoral mansion in 1998. 
''I've known many, many 
fine men in my life, and 
eulogized too many," the 
mayor said. "Terry Hatton 
really stood out. He is the 
kind of man I would like my 
son to grow up and 
become." 
Hatton and six brother firefighters were remem­bered on Thursday. On Friday, 18 services were · scheduled for uniformed members killed when the 
twin towers collapsed. 
The standing-room-only 
crowd inside St. Patrick's 
included rescue workers 
and firefighters from across 
the country.

Terror war to reselllble Cold War 
Associated Press 
CI\IRO, Egypt 
The U.S.-led struggle lo defeat terrorism is morn likely to resemble the West's decades-long contest against communism -fought on many fronts, often outside the mili­tary arena -than a major shooting war, Defense Sccrctarv Donald H. Rumsfeld said Thursday. 
Humsfeld's comments offered the strongest suggestion yet by the Bush administration that, while the U.S. military will play a role in rooting out terrorists, its contribution mav be smaller than commonly assi1med. 
U.S. military action also could come later rather than sooner. French Defense :Minister Alain Richard said retaliation for the Sept. 11 terror attacks isn't likely for several weeks. 
'The decisions to take action haven't been made," Richard said in Paris. "Everyone is going to prepare their own means that will be well-adapt­ed for a joint effort. We aren't at the end of that." 
Humsfeld himself alluded to the unlikelihood of an earlv attack. "I haven't said we are undertaking military action," he said at one point in an inter­view. 
The United States has assem­bled more than 30,000 troops in the region around Afghanistan, including two air­craft carrier battle groups, a contingent of Marines, hun­dreds of land-based warplanes and preparations for Army spe­cial operations soldiers to con­duct hit-and-run commando raids inside Afghanistan. 
Rumsfeld indicated the first purpose of the growing force might be to apply military pres­sure rather than to launch a major attack, as the freezing of terrorist groups' money is applying a financial squeeze. He stressed it could take unex­pected turns but eventually would succeed. 
The administration hopes that pressures applied over a sustained period will dry up the terrorists' sources of money, their pool of recruits and their means to hide in places such as Afghanistan. 
''It undoubtedly will prove to be a lot more like a cold war than a hot war," Rumsfeld said in the interview in his Cairo hotel room after a 14-hour day of consultations with the lead­ers of Oman and Egypt. 
Indiana fraternity 
kicked off-campus 
Associated Press 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. 
Pi Kappa Alpha on Thursday became the fifth fraternity to be kicked off the Indiana University campus in the last 18 months. 
The expulsion stems from a Sept. 16 incident in which a stu­dent was hospitalized after drinking too much at a fraterni­ty event, IU Dean of Students Dick McKaig said in a release. 
McKaig said alcohol was served to underage students after the event and the fraterni­ty failed to request state licenses or campus approval beforehand. 
Four other chapters -Sigma Alpha Mu, Alpha Sigma Phi, Theta Chi and Beta Theta Pi ­have been expelled since April of last year for a variety of alco­hol and hazing violations. 
Pi Kappa Alpha also was sus­pended in 1998 when a student, Joe Bisa:nz, died after drinking too much. Bis official cause of death was listed as choking on his own vomit, but his parents have challenged that finding. 
No one answered the phone Thursday night at the published listing for the fraternity house. 
The university said officials at Pi Kappa Alpha's national head­quarters accepted the expulsion and would cooperate with the university to enforce it. 
The expulsion is effective for at least two years.

Airline security bill stalls 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
Congressional action on an aviation security bill was put off until next week as House GOP leaders objected to a compro­mise wit.h the administration on the main sticking point, the fed­eralization of airport screeners. 
The Senate for the second straight day Thursday failed to take up a bill that would enact many of the recommendations made by President Bush on bol­stering the security of aircraft and airports following tho Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. 
The Senate now plans a off They said House GOP lead­ers, in a meeting with Mincta, voiced their strong objections to going ahead with the deal. 
Senate supporters of the bill said Congress had an obligation to move quickly on the security question after approving a $15 billion rescue package for the airlines industry last week. 
"I urge my colleagues not to let the process drag us down," said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, It-Texas. She said restoring people's confidence in the safe-· ty of flying "will be the begin­ning of building our economy

Hepublicans. changes the current sys­tem where screeners are pri­vate employees and requires that federal personnel screen and check all baggage and indi­viduals boarding a plane. Screeners at smaller airports could be state or local law enforcement officials. 
The White House, backed by House GOP leaders, has resisted the creation of a new federal bureaucracy, and instead pro­posed that the government take over the supervision and train­ing but not the employment of screeners. 
Senate aides said the White House and the Senate were close to a compromise calling for full federalization, but two scheduled meetings Thursday between Senate leaders and Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta were called s h o. u 1 d 
abandon the 
effort to pass legislation and let the pres­ident impose many of the new security measures by executive order. 
"The administration is doing a lot of this now by changing the standards and regulations, and executive orders may be put in place," said Senate Republican leader Trent Lott of Mississippi. 
Some of the president's pro­posals, such as increasing the number of air marshals on board planes and compelling airlines to fortify cockpit doors, could be carried out-without congressional action. Congress would have to approve addi­tional funding for security or new passenger taxes. The Senate bill has a $2.50 fee to help pay the cost of increased security. 
The Mineta proposal that was cold-shouldered by the House would have fully federalized baggage screeners. but with the conditions that the screeners not be allowed to strike and that civil service rules making it difficult to fire workers would be waived. The workers would be under the jurisdiction of the Transportation Department. 
It also required that Democrats agree not to load the bill down with other issues, such as legislation to help laid­off airline workers or to boost railway security that would each cost about $3 billion. 
While many Republicans balk at the idea of creating a new bureaucracy of some 28,000 workers costing more than $1 billion a year, supporters of fed­eralization say that under the current system airports con­tract out security to the lowest bidder and that ·screening per­sonnel are often poorly paid, insufficiently trained and have high turnover rates. 
But William Barbour, chair­man of the Aviation Security Association, said that the wholesale government takeover of airport security would, in addition to putting thousands of current employees out of work, be far less effective than a strong public-private sector partnership as is common throughout Europe. 
He said that private security firms had proved to be fully capable when backed up by stringent federal oversight. 
The consumer group Public Citizen on Thursday also advised against giving the Federal Aviation Administration oversight over airport security, saying that the FAA has a histo­ry of watering down security­boosting rules under pressure from the airlines industry. 
"The FAA has been comman­deered by the very industry it is supposed to regulate, and as a consequence aviation security has become dangerously lax," said Public Citizen president Joan Claybrook. 

N.Y.  businesses turn to high-tech phones 

Associated Press 
NEW YORK 
Businesses and government offices left without phone service following the collapse of the World Trade Center are turning to new technologies to help them get back to work. 
The state court system had 2,300 phones in courthouses near the trade center but was left with nine after the Sept. 11 terrorist attack. This week, the courts are using 600 high-tech phones that use the Internet to carry calls. 
"Normally we would have taken a small court and done a six-month pilot with a few phones," said Judge Jonathan Lippman, the state's chief administrative judge. 
"What we did here is in one week and a day we did six months' work in order to get this in, and now we are delight­ed," Lippman said. 
The destruction of the trade center posed an unprecedented challenge to the telecommunica­tions industry. 
Cell phones stopped working, in part because the transmission towers were destroyed along with the twin towers. One Verizon switching office was destroyed and another that han­dled about 300,000 telephone lines and 3.5 million point-to­point data circuits was badly damaged. 
While most cell service is back up, Verizon spokesman Eric Rabe said more than 10,000 phone lines across a large swath of lower Manhattan are still not working. Businesses aren't wait­ing. 
Merrill Lynch, for example, is using "free-space" fiberless optics to transmit data from Manhattan across the Hudson River to Jersey City, N.J. . 
The technology uses safe, invisible lasers to beam a signal through the air, said Dan Hesse, chief executive of Kirkland, Wash.-based Terabeam Inc., which provides the service. 
Verizon crews have been restoring service by running wires around the damage -out of windows or through trenches dug in the streets. 
Residential customers can use 200 free phones Verizon has placed on trailers around lower Manhattan.

Greyhound driver speaks out 
Associai,,d Press 
MANCHESTER, Tenn. 
The Greyhound driver whose throat was slashed by a passen­ger said Thursday that getting the other riders to safety after the bus crashed was his top pri­ority. 
The driver crawled from the wreckage for help after Wednesday's attack, but six of the 39 passengers, including the assailant, died. 
"By the time I was able to get out of the bus, I ran about 200 yards," Garfield Sands said dur­ing a news conference at the hospital where he is recovering. "Help was already there." 
Sands wore bandages on his neck and left arm and spoke to reporters from a wheelchair. He received stitches for two 5-inch­long, 2-inch-deep slashes on the side of his neck. 
"I feel so good I'm hoping I get to go home tomorrow." Sands said. His doctor. Ralph Bard, agreed he might be released by then. 
Sands, 53. of Marietta. Ga., declined to talk about the attack, saying Greyhound would allow him to say more later. "They want me to hold my com­ments for a while." 
Authorities identified two of the dead Thursday -Amelia Ortiz Nerio, 73, of Lake Wales, Fla., and Fannie Jones, 68, of Georgia. Some of those who died were not carrying identifi­cation, slowing the process of releasing their names, authori­ties said. 
Only one other body has been identified -Damir Igric, a Croatian citizen the FBI said attacked Sands and then tried to take control of the bus, send­ing it across the oncoming lanes before it toppled into a field. 
A relief driver on the bus also helped passengers out of the wreckage. Lawrence Payton had refused to give up his seat behind the driver to the assailant before the attack, Greyhound spokeswoman Kr.isten Parsley said. 
She called Sands and Payton "absolute heroes." The compa­ny planned to reward the men in some way, but no decision has been made on how, spokes­woman Parsley said. 
Passengers who survived the crash were all injured, includ­ing a pregnant woman, Elena Wilson, who underwent a suc­cessful Caesarean section hours later. She and her newborn daughter were in stable condi­tion Thursday. 
The PB! said Igric, 29, entered the United States in Miami in 1999 with one month left on his visa. He had boarded the bus in Chicago. 
In Croatia, the state-run news agency HINA quoted Igric's stepfather, Ante Spaic, as say­ing the whole family was "deeply shocked." Croatian TV quoted the family as saying that Igric worked for the last five years on cruise ships. They said they last heard from him sever­al weeks ago, when he was liv­ing in New York. 
The attacker struggled with Sands for control of the wheel before it crashed on fnterstate 24, 60 miles southeast of Nashville. Igric was thrown through the windshield. 
Sands said he was attacked with a box cutter or razor, according to Bard, who said Sands' "thick neck" saved his life. 
After the crash, Greyhound shut down service as a precau­tion, pulling 2,000 to 2,500

Plane crashes in Russia, killing at least 76 


. Relatives grieve over lost family 
Associated Press 
BEN GURION !NTL. AIRPORT, Israel 
Sobbing relatives wailed and huddled together in shock at Israel's main airport after the crash Thursday of their loved ones' plane in the Black Sea. a flight full of recent immigrants returning to Russia for family visits. 
The Russian plane had more than 60 passengers on board -most, if not all, of them Israelis -and 12 crew members when it exploded en route from Ben Gurion airport outside Tel Aviv to the Siberian city of Novosibirsk. 
Weeping relatives gathered in a lounge at Ben Gurion, trying to comfort each other, after being told their loved ones were on the Sibir Airlines flight. 
Some wailed or covered their faces with their hands. Others passed on the news in phone conversations punctu­ated by sobs. Social workers offered counseling. 
Many passengers were immigrants from the former Soviet Union who were head­ed to Novosibirsk to see rela­tives during the Jewish holi­day of Sukkot. 
Vadim Kupov, who recently moved to Israel, lost his 28­year-old wife Laila and his 18-month-old son Michael. The three had initially planned to fly to Novosibirsk for a family visit on Sept. 11, but that flight was canceled after the terror attacks on New York and Washington that day. 
Kupov said he had decided not to go with his family Thursday flight because of financial problems. Kupov's son was one of two infants aboard, aviation officials said. 
Another victim, 24-year-old Elena Starikovsky, a music student who immigrated to Israel two years ago, was headed to Novosibirsk to get married, said a friend, Dina Kulbatzka. 
Olga Kuznitsov lost her 76­y ear-old mother, Sarah Kamcha, returning to her hometown of Novosibirsk for the first time in 10 years. "She was nervous to go back to visit home," Kuznitsov said of her mother. 
Kutznitsov rushed to Ben Gurion as soon as she heard about the crash. She said she hadn't yet told her 5-year-old son, who was especially close to his grandmother. 
All outgoing flights at Ben Gurion, Israel's main airport, were grounded for about four hours, stranding thousands of passengers. Security proce­dures, already stringent at the airport, were further tight­ened, and even passengers who had already checked in were called back for another security check. 
. US: Ukraine missile may have hit plane 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
U.S. intelligence officials believe a Ukrainian long-range anti-aircraft missile fired during a military exercise accidentally blew up a Russian airliner as it flew over the Black Sea. 
The Ukrainian military denied their missiles had the range to hit the airliner. The Russians supported their statements and suggested terrorists might have been involved. 
Andy Card, President Bush's chief of staff, said not all the information was in, "but it appears that the Ukrainians did have some kind of missile exer­cise that might have hit this commercial aircraft." His com­ments came in an interview Thursday on PBS' "NewsHour With Jim Lehrer." 
The chartered Tupolev 154, carrying at least 76 people from Israel, plunged into the sea 114 miles off the Russian coastal city of Adler, on the Georgian border. The Sibir Airlines plane was on its way from Tel Aviv to the Siberian city of Novosibirsk, about 1,750 miles east of Moscow, after a stop in Bulgaria. 
The Ukrainian military was conducting a large air defense exercise in and off the coast of the Crimea, the peninsula that juts into the northern Black Sea. 
The anti-aircraft missile believed to have brought down the Tupolev 154 is known in the West as an SA-5 "Gammon." Ukrainian officials said they used S-200 missiles -the Russian designation for the SA-5 -dur­ing the exercise. 
The United States tracked the surface-to-air missile with satel­lites that sense the heat of its launch. 
The Defense Special Missile and Astronautics Center at Fort Meade, Md., picked up the mis­sile launch. 
The United States monitors military exercises worldwide as a means to view foreign military capabilities and training. Aircraft, ships and satellites are

capable of monitoring communi­cations and movements. 
Senior military and Bush administration officials doubted the terrorism claims early, which raised suspicions for hours in the µpper reaches of government including the White House. When Pentagon officials were first told a missile felled the air­craft, a weapon was cited that does not have the range needed. Later Thursday, the Pentagon was told the much larger SA-5 was involved. That, along with fresh intelligence information, virtually erased U.S. suspicions of terrorism. 
The SA-5 was of Soviet design and has been exported by Russia to other countries. It was one of the largest surface-to-air mis­siles in the old Soviet inventory, built to shoot down heavy bombers flying at high altitudes. It can hit targets up to 180 miles away and above 100,000 feet. 
The airliner crashed about 160 miles from Cape Onuk, in Crimea, site of the Ukrainian exercises. It was flying at 36,300 feet, according to another airline pilot in the region. 
It's unclear if it blundered into the exercise or if the missile went astray. Some airspace was reportedly closed around the exercise. 
John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, said U.S. intelligence also could have mon­itored the exercise by listening to Ukrainian military communica­tions from a fixed-position satel­lite that stays above Eurasia. 
After the shoot-down, he said, "At some point, somebody's going to start hollering, 'Where did that target come from?'" The 
U.S. 
monitors would have heard that. 

U.S. 
ships or aircraft -such as the Navy's EP-3 Aries and the Air Force's RC-135 Rivet Joint­also are capable of listening to communications or tracking radar blips representing aircraft and missiles. 


If any had been in the area, it's probable they would have been flying east to land at a friendly air base near Afghanistan to help in the hunt for Osama bin Laden.

More than 60 superfluous messages have moved through the system since Monday, causing headaches campus-wide for anyone logging on to check her mail. 
And that's just this week. 
The unwarranted, unnecessary messages have been spiral­ing out of control since the College enacted the listserv last fall to improve campus communication. Since then, the e-mail sys-tern has turned into a message board and advertising service rather than a communication device. Despite pleas (sent bye-mail) from vice president for Student Affairs Linda Timm. the abuse continues.

Neither BOG nor the administration is trying to take away students' rights to advertise for football tickets, find their lost personal items or advertise services. Students are allowed to post signs on campus for that purpose. They're only asking that students take the proper channels to do so, rather than inconvenience hundreds of people who don't care about the messages sent across the network. 
BOG and the administration need to restrict e-mail access immediately. This is not a complicated issue requiring debate. committees and commentary. Restrict the listserv now. If there's ample demand, create a message board on Saint Mary's Web site for posted advertisements or commentary. 
But keep it out of students' inboxes. 
Wishing for a little bit of Europe 
Last Wednesday, frustrated and exhausted, I could not wait for Friday at 12:45 p.m. I had a take-home test to finish, another paper to start, a resume to complete, too many meetings to attend, an inter­view for an intern­ship to drive to in Elkhart and a cold to overcome. 
I had a typical week as a student here. I had a very atypical week for a student studying in Austria. After a year abroad. I realized that I have had difficulty readjusting to life at an American university. I have felt lost. I have felt foreign. 
Last year, when I wrote my column from Innsbruck. l often asked my friends for their observations on adjusting to life in another country. Last week inspired me to ask them again for insight. 
This time, I questioned my fellow Innsbruckers about their thoughts on our return from abroad. I found that I have companions in my frustration and feelings of detachment. 
"I feel like l am a whole year behind. I feel like I should have JPW, but instead I have graduation," said senior Kirsten Housing. 
"The main reason that I miss Austria is that I got used to the pace of Europe. In Austria the environment is less hec­tic. Things get too nuts here," explained Emily Badrov. "There we could spend a day just enjoying life." 
"I miss the culture, the lifestyle and the priorities in Austria. There. the emphasis is on family and friends, a 

good glass of wine and a good opera. 
not on working as hard as you can to 
get the best job that you can. so that 
you can make as much money as you 
can," noted Motria Chaban. 
For me, the year in Austria effected a change in perspective. I had always realized the worth of books as foun­tains of knowledge. l had not always recognized the wisdom that I could gain from simply talking to others. On campus, time for simply chatting often falls second to finishing work. 
Two weeks ago, I actually made an appointment a week and a half in advance to eat lunch with a friend. We both missed the date. 
In Austria, we had time to go out. We had time to go to the gym. We had time to just walk around and enjoy a day. 
"What it comes down to is I find that here we spend a lot of time doing things that we don't want to do," observed Housing. 
Marik Frens-String also remarked that he missed the "laid-backness" of Austrian culture and more importantly, the freedom. "I miss being able to just go. To decide to just ride to Italy for dinner." 
Last year Munich arid Florence felt close by to us. masters of the European train system. This year, without a car; Grape Road has felt distant. 
Yet at the same time joyful reunions with friends and the campus communi­ty as a whole have balanced feelings of lost liberty and longing for Austria. 
"In Austria I missed T.J. [her boyfriend], my friends and my family. I just feel more comfortable here," said Amanda Hoffman. 
During Freshmen Orientation week­end l screamed and made an unbeliev­able scene in the bookstore. when by chance, I saw one of my best friends from freshman year a day earlier than planned. I have loved sitting in LaFortune and Reckers, not only see­ing people that I knew well, but also recognizing faces of students that I passed each day on my way to class or in the dining hall. 
"I like getting back into the school spirit," remarked Housing. 
In Innsbruck, the university exists more as separate buildings in the city rather than a close-knit. connected community. 
Eventually the sense of unity here draws travelling students back into the rhythm of life on campus. Readjusting becomes a matter of incorporating lessons learned in Austria into the time spent at the University. 
My friends from Innsbruck and l often meet for coffee. With our eyes glazed after hours spent reading we drag each other from the library. · 
Last week when I announced that 1 would never survive until Friday, they ordered me not to worry. They remind­ed me that last year I had difficulty with my German work. I had always finished my assignments before my year abroad. I would complete every­thing by Friday. 
Yet even after classes in DeBartolo, papers written at 3 a.m. and weeks spent on the second floor of the library again become routine. l will still look past the Dome in search of the Alps. l will still wish for one more day on a train with my friends, watching the landscape of Europe roll past.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Blame economy, not the poor 
J\s I see it, Ms. Niles' approach to the question of opportunity in the United States, as outlined in yesterday's column, is flawed from conception. Ms. Niles assumes that the poor in the United States are "a brooding, sullen class" who sulk around hoping the "world realizes it owes them something." 
In reality, the great majority of Americans living below the poverty rate work one or more full-time jobs. Indeed, 7 .6 percent of American families with at least one worker live in poverty (2000 
U.S. Census). This supposed sense ofentitlement comes neither from the poor nor does the "upper-middle class" impose it on them. The poor and their advocates have argued continually for a more equitable share of the wealth that they have helped to create and to have equal access to health care, education and social wel­fare programs. Whether these programs emerged during the New Deal or out of the Great Society. the effort to expand access to opportunity required hard work and continued efforts on the part of the poor. 
The very programs such as commw1ity colleges, expanded immi­gration and increased political rights ofcitizens, which Ms. Niles cites as assisting her parents, but notably did not perceive as enti­tlements, were designed to increase the opportunities for all Americans and end poverty in the progress. Unfortunately, many of these programs never fully developed nor were they expanded to cover the entirety of society, which leads to Ms. Niles' misguided and uninfor,:ned understanding of the poor and the concept of enti­tlement. 
The assumption that the poor are lazy and that opportunity abounds in America is a tremendous misreading of history as well as today's economy and society. As Michael Harrington argued in "The Other America," the poor remain in poverty not due to a lack of hard work or desire but by a cycle of poor education, poor health care and limited opportunities based on the combination of the two deficiencies. 
To browbeat the poor for being a "sullen horse gloomily plodding along" does a great injustice to them and, in many ways, to the teachings of the Catholic Church. The problem steins not from enti­tlements or lack of a work ethic but from an economy that does not equitably distribute wealth.

Delving into implications of stem cell research 
On Oct. 2 my good friend and esteemed col­league, Professor of Law emeritus Charles Rice, in an opinion column dealing with limited Presidential approval of federal funding for research on stem cell lines derived from human embryos asked whether. "the parents of a (human} embryo have standing to consent to the killing of their child?" 
That is a deeply disturbing question and no one should take it lightly, even though Professor Rice insists on asking it in the lawyerly style that will offend some and intimidate others. But, since this is a university, the premis­es of Professor Rice's question must be examined critically. 
The embryonic stem cells covered by the Bush policy were obtained from embryos produced in vitro in the course of fertility treat­ments for couples unable to conceive in vivo. Since fer­tilization and all the early steps of cell division and implantation are highly frag­ile and contingent processes, such fertility treatments usually involve more than one egg and so more than one zygote and more than one multi-celled embryos often result. 
Such treatment proceeds with an attempt to implant one of these embryos in the mother's uterus. Others are frozen to.interrupt further cell division and preserve the option of subsequent efforts to initiate a pregnancy if one or more of the early attempts fails to achieve the desired result. 
Professor Rice chooses to characterize a parental decision to make available for medical research embryos created, but not used in this manner, as constituting "consent to the killing of their child." 
Catholic parents everywhere will understand what he means. Those of us who, with the help of God and an heroic and saintly partner have, as has Professor Rice himself, raised many chil­dren. have felt the truth of what he says in our 
,ri bones. But the facts of human life are that there is never just a baby, there is always a baby and someone, someone who will carry it to term and birth and then additional adults who will nur­ture it through long years of infancy, childhood and even adolescence. Professor Rice knows the sacrifice that requires. !·suspect he might agree that few of us make that sacrifice without the help of divine grace. But we live in a society whose laws cannot presume the operation of such grace. I submit that, in such a soci­ety, to characterize the dona­tion of a very early embryo created as part of an effort to achieve a pregnancy, as involv­ing "consent to the killing of (one's) child," is question-begging in the extreme and without any pro­bative value whatsoever. Professor Rice and other faculty who agree with him are wise and good people and I hope they are willing to support the vehemence of their opposition to biomedical research on stem cells derived from human embryos with further argument and discussion.

Do Davie's looks limit his coaching ability?

the Irish. 
Now, the sports columnists and Saturday armchair-quarterbacks have a variety of theories, ranging from the plausible (the team doesn't respect him) to the ridiculous-but-also-kind-of-plausi­ble (it's bad luck because he's a non­Catholic coach). But I now gaze upon these theories the same way I gaze upon the large cockroach I saw the other day making his way austerely across the floor of South Dining Hall. {I think he was returning his tray.) 
Davie is a bad head coach for one rea­son, and one reason alone: the man is just too good-looking. 
Now.just to dispel any rumors, or fin­ger pointing, let me put forth the stan­dard heterosexual male's homophobic disclaimer: l, in no way, find Bob Davie attractive. And I'm sure, for those of you who would ask, that he, in no way, finds me attractive. 
But watching the Nebraska game on television with bored females gave me a new insight. In between their sniping at the cheerleaders that appeared on screen, ("Oh, she's in my accounting class. She thinks she's really hot.") I heard comments on Davie. Incidentally, these were the only positive comments about the coach the whole evening. 
And it slowly dawned on me: these women saw Davie as a sex symbol. Is this so hard to picture? A girl goes to the game, she's a little tipsy and she's wait­ing for the Irish to "hit a home run." But due to the lackluster offense, her mind turns to other things. She gets a far-off look in her eyes and finds herself in the midst of an elaborate fantasy where she is the stubborn rookie and Davie is the swarthy coach-a-pleasure. Or so I imag­ine (sigh). 
I decided to gather a focus group of appropriately giggly girls. When I showed my small group a picture of our head coach it got the reaction I expected. Some standout features of the beloved leader: the salt-n-pepper hair, the fakn-n-bake tan and the nicely whitened, capped teeth. One lady exclaimed lovingly "he's got a nice nose." 
And apparently Davie's charm doesn't end with the physical either. One group member was attracted to the way Davie comported himself. "He's very authorita­tive at the pep rallies," she happily pro­claimed. "I like how he says 'We're gonna win' even though it seems like he knows they're going to lose. That's sexy." 
So we've established that Davie is indeed good looking. Some (not me though, remember?) might even say that he's roguishly handsome. 
So how does this affect his coaching abilities, you ask? Upon closer examina­tion, there is a direct correlation. Or should I say, an inverse correlation. 
Because it appears that as attractive­ness goes up, coaching ability goes down the proverbial toilet. · 
Take, as an initial example, Bob's pre­decessor, Lou Holtz. I don't know if you've seen Holtz lately. He's on TV a lot because he's tearing things up as head coach at University of South Carolina. It's an odd thing, but every time I see Holtz, he looks distinctly more like a gremlin. I can't explain it, and I don't know if it should frighten me or not, but it's the truth. You'd be hard pressed to find a coach as revered and respected, but you're even more hard pressed to find a close-up picture of the man on his web­site, www.louholtz.com. 
However, Holtz, all 4-foot-9 of him, got results. That cannot be denied. 
In the same vein, Knute Rockne, long recognized as the greatest college foot­ball coach of all time. was no George Clooney, if you catch my drift. His bust in the Rockne Memorial building looks like someone dropped it a couple of times try­ing to get it onto the pedestal. But Knute is a legend, if not the legend. 
So now the essential question: what is to be done about Davie? Endlessly analyzing the situation doesn't get the Irish any closer to a win. Should we just sit back and wait for a hideous accident to scar the coach and 
give him back his coaching ability? I for 
one don't think that this is the answer. 
First of all, many students on campus are already waiting for an accident to befall Davie. Plus, even ifhe were to be hideously scarred, I have a feeling he'd get some of that Mel Gibson in "Man Without a Face" thing going and still be a bad coach. 
Should Kevin White fire the guy? Well, assuming that the athletic director is legally allowed to do this, I still doubt that he will. After all,. White signed Bob Davie through the year 2005, and our buddy Kev knows what he's doing. After all, it's his highly-paid job on the line too. And even if we could fire Davie, I'm not sure we should. I kind of feel sorry for the guy. I mean. it's not like he's trying to lose. 
I'd just like to close by saying that we may think that .Davie is a bad coach, but I'm pretty sure that he's not a bad per­son, and we need to stop labeling him as such. Besides, apparently he's already in enough trouble with God for the whole "not-being-Catholic" thing.

Waking up 

By JACQUELINE OSTROWSKI · 
Scene Writer 
The first time he stepped into Notre Dame Stadium, New York Times bflst-selling author Joe Garner saw the blending of tradition, unity and spirit that make Notre Dame football unique among college teams. 
"T recall feeling lib' you could sf!e the ghosts of the students, players, and fans of the past minglin'g with the students, players and fans of the present ... all hoping 
that today would become leg­endary," said Garner. His memory of that day added to the inspiration and excitement he felt while writ­ing his latest book, "Echoes of Notre Dame Football." 
When the author searched for a new topic for his next book, several alumni contacted him and suggest­ed he explore Notre Dame football. The idea of covering such a time­less tradition came as a daunting but exciting project. 
"I went to campus and was 
awestruck by both the physical experience of being there and the realization of the legend that l was con­templating taking on," said Garner. "It was the combi­nation of the thrills and excitement of college football and the storied tradition of Notre Dame football that inspired me to take on 'Echoes of Notre Dame Football."' 
Garner began his project at Notre Dame and discussed his idea with many Notre Dame sources within the Athletic Department, University Relations and Public Relations, among others. 

tional players and coaches for his book, filling it with the words and recollections of such broadcasters as Dick Enberg, Tony Roberts and Keith Jackson. He opened "Echoes" with Ara Parseghian's words and concluded with Joe Theismann's afterword. 

"If you had a Mount Hushrnore of Notre Dame notables, these people would be up there," said Garner. 
However, fans of Irish football know that books on the topic are plentiful. In order to make his book noticeable in a sea of Notre Dame football books, Garner had to devel­op a new angle while still discussing the most cherished games and mem­ories. At a meeting with Joe Doyle, a noted South Bend historian and for­mer South Bend Tribune writer, Garner first realized the magnitude of this undertaking.

Author Joe Garner has documented Notre Dame football lore both in , 
"ThAy WAre extr0mely generous and gracious with their time, guidance and archives," said Garner. 
His first experiences on campus undoubtedly helped Garner to infuse his entire book with the indefinable Notre Dame spirit. Although he did not attend Notre Dame, Garner is as aware as any student or alumnus of the intangible Notre Dame mystique. 
On a bitterly cold January day, he first became con­scious of the aura surrounding the campus. As he walked through God Quad, he saw the Golden Dome and Mary standing on the Dome through a clearing of bare 
branches. 
any other book he had written. vVhile his past compilations include numerous historical broadcasts or moments from a variety of sports, this new book focused on only one sport and one team. 
"I had an opportunity to really understand not only how the game has changed, but how the different eras of Notre Dame football have fit together like pieces of a puzzle," said Garner. "It took over 100 years to form the picture of Notre Dame football that we see today. '[Echoes of Notre Dame Footballl' is really the evolution of Notre Dame football." 
To ensure an accurate and informative read, Garner 
performed extensive research on the 
topic. He contacted the most excep­

From then on, Garner strove to offer fans a unique take on a familiar subject. His distinct journalistic back­ground paved the way for this new approach.

sports or radio history. 
"The signature of my books is the inclusion of the broadcasts for each of the events that I cover," said Garner. "We hear certain broadcasts and U's like hear­ing a favorite song on the radio. It's visceral and it's .a very nostalgic experience." 
For Garner, the ability of these broadcasts to virtually transport listeners into Notre Dame Stadium on game day Saturdays cannot be underesti­mated. 

"Unless you were fortunate enough to be in the Stadium, vour recollection or that event is inextricable with the broadcast," hn said. "It allows you to experience [the game] again. A good book takes place in the theater of the mind; adding the audio only sharpens that image." 
Of course, the recording of such monumen­tal moments required a narrator who was passionate and appropriate for such a project. In Garner's mind, there was little debate as to who should be chosen. 
"Because I dedicated the book to the fans, I wanted a fan to do the honors of narrating it," said Garner. ~In my estimation, the most famous and most spirited fan is Regis Philbin." He added that Philbin's enthusiasm for Notre Dame and its football program is evident in Philbin's spirited readings. 
Although selecting Philbin to narrate was relatively easy, deciding exactly which games to include in "Echoes" proved more of a chal­lenge for Garner. Although Notre Dame foot­ball dates back to 1887, nearly a quarter of the games were played before radio broad­casts. Since Garner wanted to focus on the broadcast era, games from before the J920s were not included in his book. Also, not all game broadcasts have survived. which left Garner in the difficult position of deciding how, if at all, to include certain unforgettable games that seemed to require inclusion.

MEN'S INTERHALL FOOTBALL GOLD LEAGUE 
Alumni, Morrissey meet in key league game 
By MATT DeNICOLA and MATT MOONEY 
Sporn Writers 
The Alumni Dawgs (1-1) suf­fered a tough loss in the first week. But, with their starting tailback injured, they were able to bounce back and win last Sunday. 
The Morrissey Manorites also enter Sunday's match-up at 1-1 after a goal line stand against the Stanford Griffins sealed their first Win of the year last week. 
"We think we have the tal­ent to beat anyone when we are on our game," said Alumni captain Nick Unstroth. "We are pretty con fident with the way we looked last week." 
This confidenct:1 comes from stellar performances from fullback Brandon Nunnink and quarterback Chris Cottingham. Nunnink became the primary ball carrier when the Dawgs lost their starting tailback to injury. And he has not disappointed. 
"Brandon [Nunnink] has really stepped up big," said Linstroth. Nunnink came up with big rushes last week, including the game winning touchdown. Combine this per­formance with the consistency of team leader and quarter­back Christ Cottingham, and Alumni puts forth a formida­ble offense. 
But the Manorites are not afraid of tough opponents. Although they lost to Keenan in their first week, they held the Knights to just one touch­down. Keenan is the only team to score on undefeated Dillon this year. 
In their second game, Morrissey shut down a fired up Stanford offense for its first win. 
"The offensive and defensive lines have played really well," said Morrissey captain Andy Baum. "I am really proud of how far along the boys have come." 
Both teams are confident about a playoff berth. 
"This game is a stepping stone for improvement as we go toward the playoffs," said Linstroth. "We are just going to work on executing in game situations." 
The Manorites will not be afrai-d, but they will have their hands full with the Dawgs. 
"Our ·offensive line is quick and executing," said Linstroth. "When we play like that, we can dominate any team in the league." 
The game starts at 1 p.m. at Stepan Fields. 
Dillon vs. Stanford 
In a four game regular sea­son, every win is crucial in order to get into the playoffs. No one knows this better than Dillon (2-0) and Stanford (0-2) who are on opposite ends of the standings. 
Dillon has been dominating the league, leading in touch­downs scored -five -and touchdowns allowed -one. However, the Big Red knows it cannot underestimate Stanford. 
"This is a big game for them, their backs are against the wall," said Dillon captain Tayt Odom. "We can't go in there thinking this is going to be an easy game. If we do, it probably won't turn out like that." 
The Big Red have been try­ing to improve its playbook in practice. 
"We put in a couple new defensive schemes and added a play to the offense," said Odom. "But mostly, we just want to get better at what we have been doing all year." 
The Griffins understand the importance of this game. They need a victory to stay in con­tenti on for the playoffs. However, they have remained confident about their chances. 
"We have been working on the run defense," said Stanford captain. Dave Dilworth. "We just want to keep getting better and do what we know we can do out there." 
The Stanford defense has been consistently solid, but their offense has struggled. The Griffins believe this may be due to missing players. 
Last week, Stanford replaced their regular quar­terback with their running back. This unfamiliarity with the position caused three fum­bles, an interception and missed snaps by the Griffins. 
"It's good to have our quar­terback [Nick Befera] back," said Baum. 
This week, the Griffins hope that Befera can spark their offense. 
"I think this game will be OK," said Baul1_l. "It is going to come down to the offense and the offensive line." 
The Big Red does not dis­agree. Behind the excellent play of Ryan Hernandez on both the offensive and defen­sive lines, Dillon has com­pletely shut down their com­petition. 
"He has had some fantastic games," said Odom. "And we are confident he will step up again." 
For Dillon, a victory clinches its spot in the playoffs. For Stanford, a loss eliminates its possibilities. 
"Their backs arc against the wall ... they will be on the top of their game," said Odom. "But we are just going to play our game." 
The game starts at 2 p.m. at the Riehle Fields. 
Keough vs. Keenan 
Sunday's interhall game between Keough and Keenan has serious playoff ramifica­tions. 
While undefeated confer­ence leader Dillon looks like a shoe-in, there is a four team log jam between the Kangaroos, the Knights, Alumni and Morrissey for the other three playoff spots. 
Keenan in particular faces a difficult situation. As defend­ing champions, not making the playoffs would be a tremendous disappointment. Keough, however, wants a win just as badly. 
"This is an important game for the playoff picture,"said Keough captain and quarter­back Andy Hess. "If we win at least one out of the next two we still have a shot so it would be nice to have [one] in our pocket after this week­end." 
To get that win, the Kangaroos will need to make a few improvements on offense. After scoring only seven points in each of their first two games, Hess realizes 
. 
the offense needs to be more productive. 
"Our offense isn't where it should be. Part of that is my fault. 1 haven't had the type of games I need to have for us to win," he said. "If we can have people step up on offense that would be the key to victory." 
However, Keenan's offense hasn't been a juggernaut either. With a freshman quar­terback, the growing pains and adjustments have been rough. Against Dillon, quar­terback Patrick Downey had no completions and two turnovers at the end of the first half. 
The two defenses have been nearly identical. In the first week, both posted shutouts. However, last week, both the Kangaroo and Knight defenses were scored on, with Keough giving up 14 and Keenan get­ting lit up for 28 points. Despite allowing two touch­downs last week, Hess still has confidence in his defense. 
"We've had some really good play out of our defense all year," he said. "They're pretty physical on defense but so are we. I look for it to be a pretty close game." 
Keenan's defense looks to reestablish itself after getting run over for four touchdowns last week. 
With a chance for a Stadium game on the line, both teams look to gain the upper hand in a tight playoff race. Keenan will meet Keough at 3 p.m. Sunday at Riehle.

Henderson tied Cobb's 73­year-old record of 2,245 runs on Wednesday night on Ryan Klesko's two-run double in a 12-5 loss to the Dodgers.

Jones sparked a three-run inning with a two-run double and Brian Jordan added a two­run homer in the seventh as the Atlanta Braves beat the Philadelphia Phillies 6-2 Thursday night to clinch a tie for the NL East title. 
The Braves, seeking a 10th consecutive division champi­onship, lead the Phillies by three games with three left ­all at home against Florida. The Phillies close the regular season with three games at Cincinnati.

"It was a chance to get some momentum early with a big hit," Jones said. "It was big for the ballclub, but bigger for me from a confidence standpoint. I hadn't gotten a big hit like that in a long time." 
Jones hit over .400 in Atlanta's last 17 games but in that span had only four plate appearances with runners in scoring position, going O-for-1 with three walks. 
"In that situation, with nobody out, they have to pitch to you," he said. "It's a situation I like to be in." 
B.J. Surhoff added an RBI sin­gle for a 3-1 lead, enough for John Burkett (12-12) and four Braves relievers. 
Atlanta added a run in the second on Giles' RBI single and Jordan homered off Rheal Cormier. Jordan, who has three homers and 10 RBIs in the past six games, struck out in the second after Jones was inten­tionally walked. 
"I knew he was mad after . that at bat," said Jones. "He thrives on those situations." 
After the homer, Jordan threw his fist in the air as he crossed home plate, then did it again as fans roared until he gave a curtain call. 
"I was just happy to get another opportunity," Jordan said. "I was frustrated not com­ing through when they walked Chipper." 
Philadelphia scored in the first inning on a double by Bobby Abreu and RBI bloop sin­gle by Scott Rolen. Philadelphia added a run in the sixth on Abreu's run-scoring double. 
Burkett, who had gone 0-4 in his last five starts with a 6.41 ERA, allowed six hits and two runs in 5 .2/3 innings. 
Duckworth gave up six hits and four runs in 4 1/3 innings. 
"We have to count on the Marlins," he said. "I don't think anybody is going to be satisfied with second place."

'"" MEN'S INTERHALL FOOTBALL BLUE LEAGUE 
O'Neill, Siegfried set for battle over trophy 
By MATT LOZAR and JOE 
HETTLER 
Sports Writers 
The winner of this week's inter­hall game between O'Neill and Siegfried will get more than just a victory. 
The O'Neill and Sfogfried fami­lies began a tradition of awarding a trophy to the Vvinner of the inter­hall game between the dorms. The tradition began in 1996, the year O'Neill was built and Siegfried was changed to a male dorm.. 
"It's been at Siegfried for the past three years," said senior Siegfried captain Rob Plumby. "It is a pretty nice trophy and is big." 
"I know Joe O'Neill will be at the game," said senior O'Neill captain John Enterline. "It is a little some­thing special to play for." 
If Siegfried (2-0) wins, the Ramblers will earn their third vic­tory and all but secure a spot in the playoffs. 
''This game is very important since we are 2-0," said Plwnby. "If we can win this game, we can be in the driver's seat." 
The Angry Mob (1-1) is experi­encing the excitement of a playoff race for the first time ever after earning their first victory in week one. 
"It is a good feeling," said Enterline. "We like the idea that we control our destiny. It is a total­ly new experience for O'Neill." 
After their 14-7 victory over St. 
Edward's, O'Neill fell 8-0 to Fisher in a defensive struggle. Enterline hopes the Angry Mob defense will play well again this week. 
"We realized last week that they have a potent offense," he said. "We think our corners match up well with Siegfried's receivers." 
The llambler offense exploded last week in a 21-7 victory over the Juggs from Knott. Plumby's three touchdown passes and senior run­ning back Travis Smith led the offense. 
"Travis Smith has really carried this offense,'' said Plumby. "Pete Aguiar and Bill Bingle have also played well." 
Both teams know what they have to do if they want to come home with a victory and the tro­phy. 
"Our best chance is to play smart football," said Enterline. "We want to play hard and give Siegfried all we've got. We realize they are a good team, but if we play hard, then we'll have nothing to hang our heads about." 
Knott vs. Sorin 
Last week, Sorin's interhall foot­ball team came very close to being 1-0 at this point in the season. But because the Otters fell a half-yard short on a two-point conversion against Zahm, the Otters are in the same position as Knott -winless. 
According to Sorin receiver Tom Doar, the Otters must have better play from their defensive front in 
order to be successful thi-; week. 
"We have to stop the run," said 
Doar. "Our weakness is right up 
the middle when teams run at us. 
We need to be able to stop the 
three and four yard plays because 
we just can't give [Knott] that 
every possession." 
Knott co-captain Brian 
Schmutzler, on the other hand, 
knows that his team must play 
more consistent. 
"Last year we had a bunch of 
veterans [on defense)and this year 
we lost all of our linebackers, two 
of our defensive lineman and two 
of our safeties," said Schmutzler. 
"So we're still trying to put things 
together." 
A win this week is essential for 
both teams, according to the play­
ers. 
"Pretty much Siegfried and 
Fisher are already in the playofls, 
and so at this point we feel it's 
basically between us, Zahm and 
Sorin," said Schmutzler. "And our 
next two games arc against those 
two teams, so if we win out we . make the playoffs." 
Doar also believes Sorin will def­
initely be playing in the postsea­
sondespite the early loss. 
"We're very confident that we'll 
make the playoffs," said Doar. "I 
think that if we can win two of our 
next three, we're in the playoffs 
and I'm confident that we can win 
our next three games." 
According to Doar, Sorin has 
additional motivation to win 
because Knott has ended the 
Otters' season numerous times. 
"Knott's been a power the last few years," said Doar. "From the history of Sorin, this week is a big game for us because Knott has always stood in the way of our championship." 
Fisher vs. St. Edwards 
After being the first team ever lose to O'Neill two weeks ago in interhall football, things don't get any easier for St. Edward's this Sunday when they face undefeated Fisher. 
The Wave, 2-0, is currently at tho top of the Blue League stand­ings, while St. Ed's is in last place at 0-1. 
St. Ed's co-captain Nick Sciola knows that this week's game is especially important. 
"We are definitely confident that we can still make the playoffs," said Sciola. "But we just have to go out and get the job done now." 
Unfortunately for the Stcds. they will have to play this week without their senior tailback Ernesto Lacayo. Sciola feels that this is a significant loss to the team. 
"He was a very intricate part of our offense," said Sciola. "He's a hard runner and a big hitter, so it hurts a lot. We're going to have to adjust because injuries are just a part of the game." 
The injury bug hit Fisher as well last week when tight end, Christian Braunlich, went down last week because of a dislocated shoulder. 
Braunlich had a touchdown and two two-point conversions in the Wave's win against Knott in week one. According to Fisher co-cap­tain and linebacker Ray Aftandilians this injury has been the only thing to go wrong so far this season. 
"The team has played much higher than most of us expected it would," said Aftandilians. "The addition of so many talented fresh­man has added a huge burst to the team, both offensively and defen­sively." 
Aftandilians believes that Fisher won't have a letdown this week either, despite their recent success. 
"This week is big because St. Ed's has had two weeks off to practice so we need to make sure to execute the details and work together all game long," said Aftandilians. 
Due to the extra week off, St. Ed's has been able to preparn for Fisher a little more than usual. 
"We know that Fisher is a seri­ous running team, so we have to be tougher up front on the line because they have some big guys," said Sciola. "We're working on stopping the run and we also know they have some good linebackers on their team so we've been deal­ing with that [in practice] as well."

SMC CROSS COUNTRY 
Belles use meet as final tune-up for conference 
ByKATIEMcVOY A.sociate Sports Ediror 
For the Belles, today is just another day at the races. Saint Mary's runs in the Eagle Invitational at Benedictine University this afternoon more focused on preparing for the MIAA Championships in four weeks than the results of today's race. 
"I've been viewing all our conference meets as work outs," said head coach Dave Barstis. 'Tm not really wor­ried about the results." 
Although he's not worried about his -team's perfor ma.nee, Barstis can count on the runners to finish with some of the best times in Saint Mary's history. This season the Belles have had 
their best finishes in the four 
years of the program. 
"It's probably our best sea­son since we've had a cross country team here," senior . captain Nicky Prezioso said. "l think it has a lot to do with 
team chemistry." 
The team chemistry allowed 
the Belles to finish higher 
than last place in the MIAA 
Jamboree for the first time 
and to finish in third place

Park University Invitational.

WOMEN'S INTERHALL FOOTBALL 
Ducks soar 
with Veselik 
By MATT FURRlE 
Sports Writer 
There are certain players with the ability to break a game wide open, players that become an instant threat whenever they touch the ball. 
When the Howard Ducks meet the McGlinn Shamrocks Sunday afternoon, the Ducks will have to look no further than senior quarterback Jill Veselik for this type of gamebreaker. 
"Our whole offense is very comfortable with her," said Howard team captain Katie Cawley. "She has an amazing ability to read the other team's defense and has great mobility in the back field." 
Veselik has been one of the keys to Howard's success this season. The Ducks, currently 2­2, looked impressive in all four games this season partly due to her ability to run the offense. 
With targets like Katie Dinardo and Elizabeth Klimeck, the Ducks' passing attack has been its No. 1 weapon. And with one more win, they should clinch a playoff birth. 
"We're coming off a tough loss," said Cawley. "Instead of letting that get to us, we're just out to prove even more that we're a good team and we're definitely out to win." 
Winning will be extremely tough because McGlinn seems to be rolling. After four years without a win, the Shamrocks are currently 2-1-1 and focused on heading to the playoffs. 
"Our game on Sunday is going to be a lot tougher than what we have seen so far," said McGlinn captain Christa Gray. "We're hoping to continue what we had going last game." 
The Shamrocks are coming off probably their most impres­sive game in dorm history in which they defeated the Finest of Farley 28-7. 
"We did awesome last game," said Gray "Everybody really played well." 
McGlinn's execution was notable on both sides of the ball, receiving great play from players like Joanna Mikulski and Sarah Vatterott. 
Off Campus vs. Walsh 
It's do or die time for the Wild Women of Walsh. 
If they beat the Off-Campus Crime this Sunday, they can qualify for the playoffs. Lose, and they are mathematically eliminated. 
So far Walsh is undefeated on the season, but due to an inabil­ity to score, they have only one win. But a strong defense has helped them earn a 1-0-4 record. 
"Our defense has worked very well for us," said captain Alison Troy. "So we're not making any changes with it." 
In fact, Walsh arguable has the best defense in the entire league. Despite only one victo­ry, they are yet to give up a sin­gle point. But the offense has struggled to put points on the board. 
"Offensively, we are just going to keep working on executing our plays and keep improving like we have the whole season," said Troy. 
With the defense clicking on all cylinders, Walsh would be a serious championship con­tender if they could just get some type of offensive produc­tion. 
The main obstacle between Walsh and the playoffs is the 0­4 Crime. 
Coming off a loss to McGlinn on a last second Hail Mary pass, the Crime are hungry for their first win of the season. 
The Crime are led by their defense which held McGlinn to only 5-for-15 passing and inter­cepted three passes.

Lyons in hot playoff race 
By AARON RONSHEIM and 
DANIEL TARSHA 
Spom Writers 
After an 0-2 start the Lyons Lions have rebounded for two consecutive victories and now find themselves in the thick of a playoff race. 
With a 20-12 victory against Pangborn last Sunday the Lions are brimming with confidence. 
"We started of a little slow but we have worked very hard," said linebacker and co-captain Irene Onyeagbako. "The first win gave us some confidence-. Our offense is just starting to click. 
At quarterback for the Lions offense will be co-captain Sara Jenkins. 
''The passing game is coming together," said Jenkins. "It is a lot different in games then in practice. It took us a while to get adjusted." 
The constant throughout the season for the Lions has been the play of their defense. 
"Our defense is ceriainly tough, we really bear down the two and one point conversions," said Onyeagbako. "I don't think anyone has converted on us all year." 
The Lyons defense will be in for a test on Sunday afternoon when they face Pasquerilla West and its explosive offense. PW quarterback Leslie Schmidt is coming off a four-touchdown performance against Pangborn last Thursday. 
"Our offense has improved a lot. We know we have the ability to score more than once a game," Schmidt said. "We don't have to rely on our defense to go out shut the other team out." 
The one the reasons for the success of the Weasels passing game is their depth at wide receiver. 
"All of our receivers can catch," Schmidt said. "We just 
don't have one receiver the 
other team can key on." 
The match up between PW passing attack and Lyons pass defense will pit each teams strengths against each other. 
"The strength of our defense is our pass defense," said Onyeagbako. "We see our offense in practice everyday. They pass a lot so we should be readv." 
Foi:· each team this game has playoffs implications. Both teams are 2-2 and need at least one more win to qualify for the playoffs. 
"We have one more game after this one," said Onyeagbako "So this is not a must win. Eut we would like to clinch a berth as soon as possible." 
Sunday's game will be PW last rngular season game. 
"We want to close out the sea­son on a three-game win streak and have some momentum going into the playoffs," said Schmidt. 
Pangborn vs. Badin 
Sunday's match-up between the Bullfrogs of Badin and the Phoxes of Pangborn will bring two teams together that both have something to prove. A con­fident Badin team would like to string together a few wins and gear up for the playoffs. Pangborn is looking to make a statement by posting its first vvin of the season. 
Badin comes in at 1-2-1. The Bullfrogs last game was a hard fought 6-0 loss to Welsh. The leader of their defense. senior Beth Rimkus. held Welsh to its lowest scoring total of the sea­son. 
"Our defense always plays hard and goes 100 percent," Rimkus said. Badin runs a vocal man defense with free safety Rimkus getting help from a very solid strong safety, Susie Schaab. 
Katie Da Bears mans the mid-die of the defense at linebacker. 

"I anticipate a good game and I trunk our defense is prepared. We're ready," said Rimkus. 
When Badin's offense gets a chance to handle the ball, the responsibility falls on sophomore quarterback Erin Zachry. 
"Erin is picking things up and is showing improvement each game," Rimkus said. "She is really stepping it up." 
One of Zachry's main targets is fleet-footed Amy Marshall. Marshall has been a surprise performer this year and has made plays when Badin needed them the most. 
The Phoxes of Pangborn (0-4) plan to' challenge the defense of Badin with a strong passing game and a multiple set offense. The leadership of the offense rests in the strong arm of fresh­man quarterback Charlotte Troupis. "Our QB has a lot of spirit," said wide receiver Nicole Tutin said. 
Troupis' favorite targets are Tutin and Tia Vonil out of the backfield. 
Pangborn co-captain and defensive stalwart Katrina Paulson said, "We've been work­ing hard. We should be ready." 
"The strength of our team is · the willingness of our girls to go both ways," Tutin said. 
Due to small numbers Pangborn usually has to play eight-nine women on both sides of the ball. 
"We're coming out fighting," Tutin said. 
With both quarterbacks being so young you can expect both defenses to test them early and often. But that doesn't deter Badin's Rimkus, 
"Some of our teams could take on the inexperienced men's teams," she said.

Irish win locks up top seed 
By JOE LICANDRO 
Spon, Writer 
With a f'ivr game winning strnak that incluc.led a vino­ry against then-No. '.1 Nebraska last w1~ek. the Notre DamP women's sor.r.cr team is returning tn tho form that landed tlrnm in the NCAA Final Four last vear. 
This weekend the lrlsh will travel to New Jersey to play against Hig East rivals Hutgers and Seton Hall. The Irish will take on thP S('arlet Nights of HutgPrs on Friday night and take on the Pirates of Seton !lull on Sunday. This marks only the second time all SPason thP Irish will play on the road, but it will provide imponant Pxperienre for thP Irish as they eutt:>r the critiral latter stagf's of thr season. The Irish have only seven games remaining on their regular season srlrndule with only two more games at honw. 
The Irish r:urrently sit atop the Mid-AUantic divi­sion of the Big East ronfer­ence with a 4-1 conference record and an overall record of 8-0-1. Hutgers currently sits in third place with an overall record of 7-4 and a 2-1 record in the Big East. Seton Hall sits at the bottom of the division with a 3-6-1 overall record and a ('Onfer­ence rer.ord of 0-4. 
If the Irish play with the same intensity they have played with over the last two weeks. thev should win both games th.is weekend. With a win over the Rutgers 
on Friday night. the Irish will <'lincb the Mid-Atlanlir division and rPnHtin in tho drivn·'s St:>at l'or th<' top­seed in the Big East tourna­mont in carlv Novnmhtir so t hf' r P i s a· tr e m e n d o u s amount at stake tbis 'vVPPk for Notre Dam11. Although tlw Irish are undefoatt,d. Liu~ season got off to a rocky start with thP Irish strug­gling to ovP.rtime wins over lesser competition. 
Afte1· getting sonrn playPrs healthy and lea.ming to com­muniratf' with one anothnr. Notre Dame has picked up its intensity over its lasl f'ive games lo rr.verse this trPnd. 
·one reason for the lrish's rosurg('nre is tho inspired p Ia y of s 11 n ior · f\l i a Sarkr.sian. Sarkesian was named the Big East Offensive Plavnr or the Wt>ck for her effo1:ts in the Irish victories against Nebraska, Pittsburgh and West Virginia. Perhaps more importantly, coach Handy Waldrum has finally found the leadership he has benn looking for all season. 
"Sarkesian !isl really starting to emerge as the leader for this team," said Waldrum after last Sunday's win over West Virginia. "!Herl leadership is really important because we have such a young team."

"!lop<' just tied i\lma [\'Vrdnrsday! and if' wn win. we jump ahPad, dr.prnding on how Olivl't docs on Salurday," said Br.llrs' hnad coa(·h Bobby Johnston.

The Belles are exdted for the chance to match up against the Lady Dutch again. 
'Tm really excited to play this Saturday," said senior Katie ll.obinson. "This win will put us in good standings in the conference." 
To get ready for the game, the tea.m has been working on its inLPnsity and mental prepa­ration. 
"We am g-oing to work on coming out ready to play. We nerd to be ready to play for the full 90 minutes," Robinson said. 
With four of its last five ganrns resulting in Saint Mary's victories. the team feels conli­dent about Saturday's match up. 
"It'll be easier playing them because we played them before and now we know what to expect," said freshman Jen Concannon. 
Concannon, who was named the MIAA offensive player of the week last week, will defi­nitely have her work cut out for her on Saturday. Hope's Kate Dornbos and Beth Stygstra hav8 both earned MIAA defensive players of the week honors this year. 
Saint Mary's, however, remains unconcerned. 
"We've changed our lineup since the last time we played them and have a new forma­tion, so we'll see how that fairs for us," said Johnston. 
Saturday's match will be the second of a four game road trip for the Belles and will be piv­otal to their position in the league. 
"All the teams we've been really close to in scores and the whole second part of the sea­son is going to be about capi­talizing on what we did wrong in the first part of the season so that we can break .500," said Robinson.

MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL 
Bonds crushes home run No. 70 
Associated Press 
Barry Bonds hit home run No. 70 Thursday night and tied Mark '.vlcGwire's record~ a feat even Hig Mac thought might last a lifotime when he did it a mere three years ago. 
Bonds. son of an All-Star and godson of a home run king, has three games left to make history all his own. 
Bonds, · who watched Houston pitchers work around him throughout the three­game series. finally got a chance to swing in the ninth inning. He did not miss, hitting a 454-foot shot into th1~ upper deck in right field off rookie Wilfredo Hodriguez. 
Bonds immediately raised both arms in the air as he began a slow trot around the bases. The record crowd of 43,734. which had booed when Astros pitchers walked him, rewarded him with a standing ovation. 
His San Francisco team­mates poured out to greet a smiling Bonds at home plate along with Bonds' son, Nikolai. Bonds pointed at his family behind the third-base dugout as he returned to the bench. 
With fans still cheering at Enron Field, he came out for two curtain calls. Bonds took his position in left field to start the bottom of the ninth, was mobbed by teammates who were in the Giants bullpen, then was replaced and left waving his cap. 
Bonds' 70th homer marked 
the second big achievement of 
the day in the majors. Earlier, 
Rickey Henderson of San 
Diego scored his 2,246th 
r,areer run and broke Ty 
Cobb's record. 
The Giants won 10-2, com­
pleting a three-game sweep 
that kept them two games 
behind Arizona in the NL West 
race with three games 
remaining, all against Los

Angeles.  
Bonds hit his 564th career  
home run, moving him past  
Reggie Jackson -a distant  
relative -for seventh place  
on the all-time list.  
Among those cheering for  
Bonds was his godfather, Hall  
of Farner Willie Mays, who  
ranks third on the careAr list  
with 660 homP.rs.  
Bonds' father, former major  
leaguer Bobby, was at the  
Giants' first two games in  
llouston. The team. however.  
believed he had to leave town  
brfore seeing his son make  
history.  
Bonds connected on a 1-1  
pitch from Rodriguez, a 22­ 
year-old lefty making only his  
second major league appear­ 
ance. 13onds took a huge cut  
and missed the first pitch.  
watched a ball up and in, then  
launched a 93-mph fastball  
into the stands.  
The ball was caught by  
Charles Murphy of Houston.  
Bonds, a 10-time All-Star  
who could be headed to his  
record fourth MVP award, had  
never hit more than 49 home  
runs in a season before this  
year.  
But choking up on his 34­ 
inch, maplewood bat, he quickly put himself in position  ...  
to challenge McGwire's  
record, set in 1998.  
McGwire's mark captured  
the nation's attention, espe­ 
cially because he dueled  
Sammy Sosa for the standard  
of 61 set by Roger Maris in  
1961.  
When McGwire finished with  
70 home runs. it looked like it  
might become baseball's new  
magic number.  
"I think it will stand for a  
while. I know how grueling it  
is to do what I've done this  
year," he said."Will it be bro­ 
ken someday? It could be. Will  
I be alive? Possibly.  
"But if I'm not playing," he  
said, ''I'll definitely be there."  
Bonds, never the most lik­ 
able player with fans or oppo­ 
nents. did not stir quite the  
same interest as Big Mac. Not  
only was Bonds' chase not the  
biggest story in the country ­ 
not after the terrorist attacks  
on Sept. 11 -but it even fell  
behind Michael Jordan's  
return on the sports pages.  
The media contingent  
watching Bonds the last few  
days was only half the size of  
Big Mac's following.

Swimmers kick off season at Notre Drune Relays 
... 
By NOREEN GILLESPIE Sports Wrirer 
Usually, freshman athletes will spend their first colle­giate competitions warming the bench. While a few may step up and shine early, most watch their elder competi­tors, waiting for their time to compete. 
But tonight at the Notre Dame relays. the 23 freshmen on the men's and women's swim teams from Notre Dame and Saint Mary's will dive headfirst into collegiate com~ petition. 
And like Notre Dame fresh­man Kelly Barton, m_ost are nervous. 
"I don't know what to expect," said Barton, a dis­tance freestyler from Scottsdale, Ariz. "I've swam in swim meets before, obvi­ously, but not at the colle­giate level ... it's quite differ­ent." 
Because the relays offer 42 opportunities to race, every athlete on the three teams will take to the water during the meet, held for the 37th consecutive year tonight at Rolfs Aquatic Center. 
Besides offering the fresh­men a chance to step up to the blocks for the first time, the meet marks the first time all three teams will take to the water for the 2001-02 
season. That means it will be a valuable measuring tool before the teams start their dual meet seasons in the next few weeks. 
"The most important thing is to see everybody race," said men's swimming head coach Tim Welsh. "To have everybody get a little bit of playing time is a great way to begin." 
Notre Dame Women 
The women's team will face close to four hours of compe­tition today, facing the University of Pittsb·urgh for a dual meet prior to the relay competitfon. 
The meet was scheduled to coincide with Saturday's foot­ball game, according to women's head coach Bailey Weathers. 
"We're really able to triple the amount of races we· get this way," Weathers said. "That's a big help for us at this point in the season ... it gives the kids a chance to swim." 
Leading the women's class of 2005 is Katie Eckholdt, a sprinter from Omaha, Neb. Eckholdt's times are clocking in faster than fifth-year senior Big East Champion Carrie Nixon's were during her freshman year, and she's expected to make an impact, Weathers said. 
Freshman Brooke Taylor from Orlando, Fla., comes in knocking on the door of the 200 buiterfly record, and Kristen Pe.terson from Wichita, Kan. comes in with senior national experience in the backstroke events. 
"They've trained as well as any freshman class we've had, and they're handling the academic load pretty well," Weathers said. 
Outside of the freshman class, Nixon, who sat out last season wiLh an injured shoul­der, returns to competition tonight. Nixon was the 2000 Hig East Swimmer of the Year and finished second in the 50-yard freestyle at the 2000 NCAA Championships. 
Notre Dame Men 

When Welsh took his note­book out to evaluate his team's performance at an intersquad meet in practice two weeks ago, he was look­ing to see how well his team was swimming. 
"I went into that meet with big eyes, a big notebook and an empty sheet of paper," he said. 
You could say it was an early-season test. But the men's swimming and diving squad will get an even bigger test tonight, as they go head to head with the University of Pittsburgh, the 2001 Big East 
Champion team and one of Notre Dame's toughest Big East foes in 2002. 
"To do a series of relays with Pittsburgh side by side at the beginning of the sea­son is really exciting," Welsh said. "We're definitely eager to race." 
Leading the men's swim­ming class of 2005 will be Matt Bertke, a freestyler from Edgewood, Ky, David Moisan, an individual medley and breastroke swim mer from Fisherville, Ky., and Frank Krakowski, a butterflyer and freestyler from Erie, Pa. Hut the entire freshman group is working well as a unit so far, Welsh said. 
"They're getting better by the week, almost better by the day," Welsh said. 
Saint Mary's 
While the Belles will bring in nine freshmen -making up about half of their squad -to their season debut tonight at the relays, the freshmen aren't the only newcomers to the team. 
First-year. coach Gregg Petcoff will coach his first Saint Mary's meet tonight, taking the helm of the team as the third coach in four years at Saint Mary's. 
But Petcoff has bigger things on his mind than his coaching debut, as the 
Division III Belles go up against several Division I pro­grams tonight. . 
"I've been telling them, 'Swim in your own lane. don't swim in the lane next to you,"' Petcoffsaid. 
Saturday's meet will be a warm-up for a series of meets in early November, Petcoff said. The Belles will swim against two Division I teams -Texas Christian University and Western Onatario -for the first time during the dual meet season. 
"I'm taking this as an opportunity," Petcoff said. "We're going against some big teams. But hopefully, by the time they get to those meets, [the swimmers] will be like, 'Oh, again? Who cares who thev are?"' 
The B·elles, donning only one senior on their roster, will look heavilv to freshmen Lindsay Mark.in, Michelle Stanforth and Molly Maloy. 
But that's fine for the first­year competitors, according to Markin. 
"There's not a lot of senior­ity [on the teamL" Markin said. "So there's not too much pressure for us to have to step up and make our mark."

year's NCAAs, one place ahead of Watson, the team would have moved from ninth place to fourth. 
"[Shay) is a great athlete. I wish he had run last year, because that would mean he wouldn't be running this year. !Notre Dame] has a really, real­ly, really outstanding cross country team, and we're not going to beat them this year." said Ron Helmer, head coach at Georgetown, a team that ti.ed for seventh in last year's NCAAs. 
But this year, Shay returns to compete with an elite group of seniors that has been evolving together for five years, on and off the cross-country course, into a team that knows how to exceed expectations. 
Along with Shay, seniors Luke Watson, Pat Conway, Marc Striowski and Sean Zanderson arc ready to prove how they will lead a team that finds its suc­cess in running together. work­ing together and fitting togeth­er. 
"You can pick and choose an all-star team, but that doesn't guarantee that they're going to run well together. If one guy is getting inside someone else's head. that's not good. We have to have everyone working together. motivating each other," said Shay, who now shares an apartment with Watson and Zanderson. "That type of thing on a team like we have can lead to very special things." 
"Certainly having Shay back this year will make a big differ· ence, but I would hate to see it go unnoticed the contribution that Luke Watson will bring. Both are very talented," said Villanova head coach Marcus O'Sullivan. 
It was All-American Luke Watson who stepped up in every­meet for the Irish last season, especially on a 17-dcgree day in Iowa at last year's NCAA cham­pionships. His sixth place finish fueled Notre Dame, ranked No. 20 going into the meet, to their ninth place finish. 
"Being a leader was not any­thing foreign to me," said Watson, who also won the indi­vidual titles at the Valparaiso, National Catholic and District rv Championships, and finished seventh in the Big East. 
This year, seniors Pat Conway, who earned All­American status by finishing 36th in last year's NCAAs and 21st in the Big East, and Marc Striowski, who took 42nd in last year's NCAAs and eighth in the Big East, Sean Zanderson, the fifth man on last year's team, and Watson will combine with Shay, who also took 12th in the 1999 NCAA meet and first at both the Notre Dame Invitational and Big East

Championships in 1999. in the hunt for nothing less than the best season each has experi­enced individually and as a team. 
They will compete in today's Notre Dame Invitational along with sophomore Todd Mobley, who has been in the top five all season and won the Valparaiso Invitational, David Alber, who won the JV race in last week's Intercollegiate Championships, and junior John Keane. 
But it takes more than talent to evolve into a group as strong as this. 
"You could always put togeth­er the best five guys in the country," said Striowski, who lives with Conway. "But in terms of Notre Dame and tradi­tion. l don't think you could have put a better group togeth­er." 
A full force attack on a National Championship demands a commitment that extends to every aspect of the seniors' lives. 
"When we're in our heaviest training, it's essential that you have guys around you that are motivated. This energy of all liv­ing a training lifestyle feeds off of each other." said Watson. "No one really understands dis­tance runners except distance runners. It helps to be around guys who know what it means to go for an extra run before class, to get that extra half hour of sleep." 
Their common goal ties together these five individuals, and has since the beginning. 
"Ryan and I are pretty intense," said Striowski, who lives with Conway. 
"Marc and Pat and I started out together, and we've seen each other's careers the whole way through," said Watson, who has earned the nicknames "World Wide Watson," for his performance on the junior world cross country team, and "Euro Assassin." 
"Luke is pretty laid back until it comes to training and rac­ing," said Piane. 
"Sean Zanderson is kind of the Rodney Dangerfield of the team," said Watson. "Z's like the goofy skater kid, a huge Blink 182 fan. He really brings a light attitude." 
The seniors have learned a lot about each other over the last few years, including where their philosophies may clash. 
"Marc is the fiery Canadian," said Shay,. "He won't hold back if someone's not doing what they're supposed to. " 

The very thing that drives the team to success sometimes causes friction off the course. "Sometimes we get pretty com­petitive, and that can turn into some arguments," said Striowski., who will be an assis­tant coach for the Irish next year. "Sometimes we don't see eye to eye on certain things. But when it comes down to it, we're here to run. That's the most important thing, and we don't let personal things get in the way." 
Watson remembers his first experience seeing Shay in action, when things got person­al with one of his teammates. Conway and Watson watched him run a race while they were on their recruiting trip. Shay, who was a freshman at the time, broke far away from the rest of the Irish pack as a team­mate who was not running in the race yelled a comment

questioning why Shay wasn't staying with the pack. 
"Ryan was way out front, giv­ing it his all. just going to war, and he just flicked the kid off. during the race," said Watson. "I think he's learned a lot about running as a team since then." 
Shay, who had not missed a cross-country season since fifth grade before last year, still worked out with the team last fall, as he focused on building a base for track and on the 2001 cross country season. 
"Shay was still the captain. He traveled with the team, he would run alongside guys that weren't as fast as him and encourage them. His presence was there, and that's part of the reason we did well last year," said Striowski. 
A full force attack on each race, from now until NCAAs will demand that neither the experi­enced seniors nor the talented group of underclassmen ever leave anything on the course. 
"Having that cohesion and closeness really makes a differ­ence during a race, when I'm really hurting," said Watson. "There's a point where you can relax and maintain what you've been doing, or you can start picking people off. When I know my teammates are giving that extra effort, I want to do that. Even when you can't see them, you just have to have that trust and know we're all giving as much as we can for each other." 
The Irish are ranked fifth, behind Colorado, Stanford, Arkansas, and Wisconsin and will run in today's Notre Dame Invitational. at Notre Dame Golf Course. The varsity blue divi­sion race will begin at 5 p.m. 
Sophomores Brian Kerwin and Mario Bird, who helped to win the National Catholic Invitational two weeks ago by placing in the top eight, will not run in the Blue Division race. Nineteen teams wiII compete in the Blue Race for the men. Notre Dame will run a B team in the gold race, which will start at 2:45 p.m. at the Notre Dame Golf Course.

-SMC VOLLEYBALL Belles ready for Knights 
By KATIE McVOY 
Associate Sports Edi tor 
Tonight, Saint Mary's will be looking for improvement before it looks for a win. As the Belles square off against the Knights of Calvin, they are looking to play much better than the last time the two teams faced off. 
"The last time we played [Calvinl we didn't get anything going with them," head coach Julie Schroeder-Biek said. "And what we want to do is play compet­itivelv against them." 
These two teams could not be any more different. The Knights, ranked second in the MIAA, are 12-8 overall and 6-2 in the MIAA. They enter tonight's game after a decisive 3-0 win against Olivet on
-
Wednesday. The Knights returllJ)d nine players this season and are aB healthy. The Belles, on the other hand, have been struggling this season. They are coming into tonight's game 1-7 in the MIAA -2-12 overall -and are in sev­enth place in the MIAA, just ahead of winless Olivet. The Belles are recovering from a 3-0 loss to Albion on Wednesday. With a very young team, the loss of senior Angie Meyers to an injury has hit hard. Tonight, the Belles will have to work hard to bring home a win. "What we [worked on in practice Thursday] is offense," Schroeder-Biek said. "[First] passing and the second thing is going through our full offensive system so our quick attackers can hold their block." 
Holding the block will be key to defeat­ing a solid Calvin team. Knights setter 
Sara Ahrenholz has led the Knights in both setting and blocking and will pro­vide a formidable opponent for the Belles. 
"They have a very large block," Schroeder-Biek said. "Our outside attack­ers were stuck with that large block [the last time we played]. We want to make situations one on one across the net." 
Seniors Jolie LeBeau and Jaime Dineed will again be leading the Belles on the court, with support from freshmen Elise Rupright and Stacey Stark, sophomore Alison Shevik and junior Elizabeth Albert. Shevik has been a bright spot for the Belles in recent games, -recording 21 digs in Wednesday's loss to Albion. 
"That [line-up) has been doing pretty well and they're getting used to it," Schroeder-Biek said. 
Saint Mary's will also be looking to solidify communication and keep the game moving. This season has been marked by getting down early and then having to dig back up. The Belles don't want to do that tonight. 
"We need to carry momentum through the entire match and not stop playing at twenty points," Schroeder-Biek said. 
What the Belles will have on their side is home-court advantage. The match will take place at Angela Athletic Faciltiy, where the Belles have had a lot of sup­port this season. 
"I feel like it is [an advantage]," Schroeder-Bick said. " It feels so good to be at home." 
Action gets under way tonight at 6:30.

ND WOMEN'S CROSS COUNTRY 
Women set to run together for first time 
By KATIE HUGHES 
Sports Writer 
Today's Notre Dame Invitational is an important turning point, as the Irish start the second half of their season and focus on qualify­ing for nationals. 
"I think our kids are pretty excited," said head coach Tim Connelly. "It's the first time we're putting our whole team on the line. There will be a lot of specta­tors our there. Our kids get excit­ed to run at home." 
After Saturday's Invitational comes the season-defining pre­national meet. The Irish are using this weekend's meet as a final tune-up for the post season run. 
"What we've got to start doing is positioning ourselves for the post season," said Connelly. "We are going to approach this meet the way we approach regionals or nationals." 
Freshman Lauren King, who finished 26th at the World Junior Cross Country Championships last year, will run in her first colle­giate race this weekend. 
Joining King in the top race will be junior Jen Handley, who has proven to be the top finisher for the Irish thus far and won the National Catholic Invitational two weeks ago, and sophomore Megan Johnson, who finished first for the Irish in the Notre Dame Invitational last year. 
Junior Jen Fibuch, sophomore Julia Schmidt, junior Muffy Schmidt and freshman Christi Arnerich, who finished first for the Irish at the Valparaiso Invitational, round out Notre Dame's entries in the Blue divi­sion race, which will begin at 4:15 p.m. 
The Irish will also run several runners in a gold division race at 2 p.m., giving the team another chance to develop its depth. 
"In the gold race, those guys are ready,to run pretty well," said Connelly. "A number of those kids have the potential to be in the top seven to nine. It gives them some opportunities to run and affect the team score." 
Butler, Michigan, Indiana and Ball State should pose the tough­est competition for the Irish. Some out of region teams, includ­ing William and Mary, Montana, and Utah State, along with Northern Iowa, Loyola of Chicago will also compete. A total of 17 women's teams will attend. 
"You've got to get out and put yourself in the position you want to be in. If you want to finish out front, you have to put yourself out there and stay there," said Connelly.

Final piece of the puzzle 
. Shay returns to Irish after taking season off

Sometime things don't fit together exactly as planned. And sometimes, that's the best thing that could have hap­pened. 
After finishing 10th in the Olympic Trials during the sum­mer of ;moo, senior All­American Ryan Shay decided to sit out last year's cross country season just one month before the season started.

As the Irish return to Notre Dame Stadium Saturday with an 0-3 record for the first time in history, head coach Bob Davie knows he's going to hear the boos. Hut Davie hopAs a win over Pittsburgh on Saturday can quiet his critics. 
"I understand the bottom line in this profession at Notre Dame or wherever you're the coach is to win," Da.,,ic said. "In the big picture of things, I also understand that you can turn those boos into cheers awful quickly by bouncing back and winning some games. That's what we plan to do." 
Davie hopes that Irish fans can provide a. needed 12th man on defense, taunting Pittsburgh's no-huddle offense. 
"I expect our crowd will drown them out," Davie said. "They're trying to do all their r.ommunication at the line of scrimmage. I know how diffi­cult that is ... They're not. going to be able to check at the line of scrimmage probably." 
Each of Notre Dame's first three opponents Nebraska, Michigan State and Texas A&M -stepped onto the field against the Irish with a perfect record. For the first time this fall, the lrish take the field against an opponent with a loss Saturday. 
Pittsburgh head coach Walt Harris brings in a 1-2 football team looking for a win after two consecutive home losses to South Florida and Miami, respectively, the past two Saturdays. But those two losses came without the services of a full-strength Antonio Bryant, considArcd by some the top wide receiver in the country. 
Bryant, who averaged more than 130 yards receiving per game last fall, sprained his ankle during Pittsburgh's sea­son opener against East Tennessee State. He returned in a limited role against Miami last weekend. catching just throe passes for :19 yards. Bryant's lack of time on the field presents an area of con­cern for the Irish coaching staff. 
"It's kind of hard to see where he's going to be," Davie said. "It's not quite as easy as saying you just go cover guy because of the multitude of for­mations and the coverages you arc in, sometimes you gi~t your­self' screwed up." 
But Davie added that he would like to have senior cor­ncrback Shane Walton cover Bryant -sophomore Vontoz Duff is mak.iug his lirst start at the other cornerback position -but can't guarantee that Walton will be on Bryant every play. 
"Shane right now would probably give us the best opportunity," Davie said. "But it's kind of difficult because we just haven't seen [Bryant] on tape enough to know where he's going to be in those forma­tions." 
On offense, Notre Dame is looking to wake up after what Davie termed an "anemic" per­formance against Texas A&M. Carlyle Holiday, who showed flashes of brilliance as well as

Change of heart 
Walton, who started his college career playing soccer, is now the starting cornerback 
By ANDREW SOUKUP Associate Sports Editor 
When his heart told him to concentrate on soccer, he lis­tened. When his heart told him to go to Notre Dame, he paid attcnlion. 
i\nd when Shane Walton's heart told him he should give football a shol., he followed it. 
"I think if you make anv deci­sion in your· urc you have to go with your heart," hA said. "'You have to make the best decision you can. 
Walton's long journey to Notre Dame started on the strAets of San Diego. HA grew up in the sanrn neighborhood as NFL rncnivcr J.J. Stokes and would play football nearly every day on the asphalt streets. But Walton didn't play on an orga­nized football team until his freshman year of high school because football wasn't his first love. 
Walton loved soccer -and he was good at it, too. 
Although children in California are not allowed to begin playing on organized teams until they are four, he started playing soccer at age three on a team a family friend coached. From there, Walton built an impressive soccer resume that included four all­league selections and three national titles he won with a club team. Walton played foot­ball in the fall, but he couldn't wait for spring to roll around. In California, spring was soccer season. 
"I was more into soccer," Walton said. "I wasn't going to give up soccer to play football." 
So when Walton got a phone call from former Notre Dame men's soccer coach Mike Berticelli, he listened immedi­ately. Berticelli offered the young soccer standout a schol­arship to play soccer for Notre 
Dame. 
"We were real close," Walton said. "He was like my father. He was the only reason I came to Notre Dame. I never got to see the team play, I had never been this far east. My mom told Coach Berticelli, 'The only way I would let Shane come here, is if you promise to take care of him.' And ever since that moment, he took care ofme and took me into the family." 
Walton was a standout soccer player his freshman year. As a forward, he started all but one of Notre Dame's 18 games and was the first Notre Dame fresh­man in seven years to lead the Irish in scoring. 
But after the season, Berlicelli suggested Walton try to walk on to the football team. 
"Coach Berticelli spoke to the football coaches for me and asked if I could do spring foot­ball," he said. "He helped me, he wanted the best for me even if it might not have been the best for him." 
"[Shane] always had a dream to come out and play football." Irish head coach Bob Davie said. "I didn't want to use him. I didn't want to say, 'Okay, come out and play football and give up soccer.' I said, 'Look, come 
up close & personal 
WITH SHANE WALTON 

Shane Walton 
birthdate: Oct. 9, 1979 hometown: San Diego, Cal. major: sociology favorite place on campus: my room 
aword to describe me on the field: hype a word to describe me off the field: charming the best advice I've ever received: 
"You only live once, make an impression." 
I wish I could switch places for a day with: Bill Gates and spend his money 
out for football and see if you are a good enough football play­er. Don't just give up soccer."' 
Walton did just that. While he had played four years of football in high school and had compet­ed in several all-star games, Walton hadn't played organized football in over a year. But he impressed the coaches enough that Davie offered Walton a scholarship towards the end of spring practice. 
Now, Walton had a difficult decision to make -should he give up 16 years soccer for a chance to play football? Or was it more important to stick with soccer? 
During his freshman year, Walton was the leading scorer for an Irish soccer team that finished 9-6-3. He had 10 goals and seven assists, was named Big East rookie of the week three times and was a Big East All-Rookie team selection. 
And he chose to leave it all behind. 
The hardest part, Walton said. was telling Berticelli about his decision. 
"I told him I felt like I had to play football," he said. "There's no way you can sugarcoat any­thing like that. I felt like it was in my heart, and I didn't think I could give 100 percent to soccer if there was something else I wanted to do. He wished me the best." 
Walton didn't break off his friendship with Bcrticelli, how­ever. He still talked with his former coach nearly every day about everything from football to his family until Berticelli's death in 1999. To Walton, Bcrticelli was like a father. 
"The kid bad an unbelievable relationship with Mike," Davie said. "Mike did a terrific job and developed a terrific relationship with Shane and his family. It really hurt him when Mike passed away. That devastated the kid." 

"It was real tough," Walton said. "He was the closest person to me who had ever died." 
Slowly but surely, Walton coped with B~rticelli's death. With the help of his teammates and his academic advisor, Walton came to grips with what happened. And then he shifted his entire focus to football. 
Walton has emerged as the top Notre Dame cornerback this year. When the Irish play man­to-man defense, he frequently is assigned to cover the oppo­nent's best receiver. But as he is quick to say, it wasn't always that wav. 
"I tell you what, it was a real humbling experience," Walton said of his first season playing football. "I never sat on the bench with anything I did, and my sophomore year, I sat on the bench the whole year. I went from one extTeme to the other I went from being the man on the soccer field to basically nothing on the football team." 
That changed in a hurry. In his first season. with the football team, Walton saw a meager four minutes of playing time. ln his second season, Walton start­ed all 10 games he played in and was leading all Irish play­ers in total minutes when he broke his arm against Rutgers. 
"It seemed like he was more of a ballplayer, just another ballplayer coming in trying to compete for a position," corner­back Clifford Jefferson said. "He caught on real quick. He learned the position just like that." 
"It took a lot of work, it took a lot of changing," Walton said. "Soccer came easy to me. I didn't have to work as hard at soccer because it was more nat­ural. I had to develop a prac­tice ethic and a knowledge of the game offootball." 
Wal ton changed nearly every­thing about himself. He added more than 25 pounds to his 5'11" frame as he learned the ins and outs of being a corner­back. And he also learned what attitude he needed on the field -an attitude that was com­pletely different from his soccer mentality. 
"I play a position where I'm supposed to get beat," he said. "Playing cornerback, you've gotta have a short memory. There's nothing less than the best, and when I'm out there talking, I'm going to let people know I'm the best. 1like to talk. Defensive lineman, offensive lineman, refs, it doesn't matter. 
I'm having fun out there." 
But all of Walton's hard work has paid off. He has become a crucial part of Notre Dame's secondary and special teams units. He's an intense playmak­er that pushes himself and his teammates to the limit. It's hard to imagine that just three years ago, Walton was playing soccer. 
"It's amazing," cornerbacks coach Dwight Lockwood said. "When [ first heard it I was like, 'You've got to be kidding me.' When you look at him, you'd never think in 10 years that there's a kid out there starting who played soccer." 
Walton still catches himself thinking back on his soccer days. He can still hit the top­left corner with a blistering shot from 20 yards away. He still has the fancy footwork and dribbling skills. And he has more than 16 years of soccer experience. 
But soccer is in Walton's past. Football is his future. 
"I still love soccer," he said. "I wish I could play them both. But I made a decision, and in my heart, I know it was the right decision. And now there's no looking back."

Harris has done a good job turning Pitt around. He took a team that was going nowhere and turned it into a respectable team. However, the Panthers surprisingly fell to South Florida earlier this year. 

::::::::::::::::::::::::: ::::::::::::::::::::::::: ::::::::::::::::::::::::: 
QUARTERBACKS 
Davie has made it clear that the starting job is all Holiday's right now. While he believes tho sophomore quarterback gave the Irish a much needed spark, Holiday was worn out and fatigued when he left at haltimo. I !e's got a lot to prove Saturday. 
In an offense that is so dependent on the pass, Priestley does a solid job throwing the ball. He's completed 64 percent of his passes and only thrown one interception all year long. 

The Irish offense is beyond any prescription that a visit front Dr. Davie can fix. Sctta will keep the Irish on the scoreboard, but the explosiveness on the other side of the field will be too much for the Irish defense. Expect Bryant to contribute early and often. 
FINAL SCORE: Pittsburgh 24 Notre Dame 9 
The Panthers give up more yards rushing than one would expect. Most of Pitt's tackles are made by the secondary, and they've given up an average of 140 yards rushing per game.

IRISH RUSHING 
Fisher and Junes have emerged as the top backs for the Irish, but they need more help from the offensive line. Notre Dame is only averaging a mere 89 yards per game. That's like Purdue not complet­ing a pass. 

IRISH PASSING 
All season long, the Irish have been reluctant to throw dePp passes. And when they do. the pass is usually intercepted. The Irish are completing just under 50 percent of their passes and have six inteceptions. 
Pitt's secondary isn't bad, but they aren't out­standing, either. They've picked up three inter­ceptions, but when they are tested, they tend to give up a lot of yards. South Florida passed for 343 three weeks ago against the Panthers. 
Andrew Soukup associate sports editor 
It's unfair to ask Holiday to do it all. But that's what the Irish have to do s1nce nobody else is doing much. The Irish secondary will get broken apart once again this week" by an explosive Pittsburgh receiving corps. Pittsburgh lowest offensive output is 21 points -against Miami ­while Notre Dame's best all season is 10.

While Kirkley is the fea­ture back for the Panthers, that's not say­ing much. He only aver­ages 64 yards per game. In general, the Panthers tend to use the pass and save the run for short yardage situations. 
If Irons and Boiman are both healthy, Notre Dame shouldn't have"too much of'µ pr;obleiP, ~­ping the'.lPanther$r ~­ing attack. Their ·4el'en­sive f.rom_ is si~ly too

In terms of returns, the Panthers are about the same level as the Irish. Lotz is 1-for-2 on field goal attempts. Lee is a solid punter -he had three land inside the 20-yard line and is averaging 40 yards a punt.

Pitt has the statistical edge in nearly every cut,egory. Notre Dame's offense has played horribly, while Pitt has proven that its offense can get the job done. Notre Dame fans are mad. But so are the players. And they will show it on Saturday by playing over their heads and trying to put a new spin on the season. Sometimes frustration can lead to determination.

Notre Dame isn't the same when it loses 
What is the first word peo­ple think of when you say, ''Notre Dame?" What do you talk about with people when you talk about Notre Dame? What word fills in this state­ment from a kindly old man: "Well 

sonny, how 
'bout that 
team?" 
The word is football. Football is the word on everyone's lips after the words "Notre Dame." 
Now, I'm not saying defin­ing Notre Dame by football is always a good thi11g. 
Surely this fine University has more to offer than a foot­ball program coated in tradi­tion and success. But it seems no matter how many advertisements the Notre Dame public relations department runs touting Notre Dame's academics, spirituality and dining halls, people in this country will always associate Notre Dame, first and foremost, with football. 
Football has brought this University untold prestige, visitors, and money. 
They make movies about our program and players truly unique things about Notre Dame. 
Rut, with nir.ent losses, wt1 must face a sobering reality. 
Will they keep coming to Notre Dame if we keep los­ing? 
Will they keep buying licensed shirts. hats and plaid pants that pour monoy into the University's well­stuffed wallet? 
Will they turn on NBC each Saturday to watch the unranked, 0-3 Irish? 
Who knows. 
Bob Davie is 30-22 in four­plus years. Take out this year's losses, and average out his last four seasons, and rounding in his favor, Notre 
upset 
wlrnn we lose. That's why we booed tlrn coaching staff after Michigan State. That's·why. half the student body folded its arms during the 1812 Overture two Saturdays ago. 
We get upset when we lose games because we define ourselves as part of Notre Dame, and central to both Notre Dame's identity and our own identity is fontball. We have to win football games, or we don't feel quite right. 
On a greater scale, our national reputation is greatly affected by the succei,s of our football team more than any other University in the coun­try. Unfair, maybe, but the truth. 
And, ultimately, the person most responsible for the suc­cess of Notre Dame football is Davie. While the position of head football coach at Notre Dame carries the annoyance of the media and alumni con­stantly hounding your every move, it also carries the opportunity to become, like Rockne, Leahy, Parsegian and Holtz. a coaching god, eternally respected and remembered. 
These losing troubles have happened before. During the Gerry Faust years, Notre Dame was worse than we are right now. Faust was fired, and they brought in a coach named Lou Holt.z. who offered Notre Dame football a new beginning, a national championship, and newfound pride. The program returned to prominence strongf\r than ever. 
We need someone to bring us back. Who will that person be Davie or someone else? Only Kevin White, Monk Malloy. and a few trustees will determine that. 
But I know a coach, a small guy with sandy blond hair that could make it happen, but it would take some con­vincing. 
Lou, will you take us back?

game hype 
from our program that weren't even good, playP-rs that were "five-foot-no thin', a 100 and nothin'." People come to Notre Dame for games even though they've never known anyone who went here. 
Why is this?

in that game. The Sooners took offense. Head Coach Bob Stoops told the Associated Press, "We like to think we had something to do with it." 
Quarterback Chris Simms, son of NFL Hall of Fame quarterback Phil Simms, is the wild card for the Longhorns. He completed 21 of 2 6 passes in last week's 42­7 victory over Texas Tech. 
The Sooners have won 17 in a row. However. Kansas State exposed some holes in their high­ly touted defense by scoring 37 points against 
Oklahoma last Saturday. 
Poor tackling  was  the  
main  reason  for  the  
breakdown.  

A key to this game could be the fact that Texas has yet to play in a close football game this year. Simms has improved steadily, but with little game pressure on him. That will change this weekend. Look for the Oklahoma defense to try to rattle him with blitzes and disguised coverage packages. Oklahoma needs to return to their normal defensive ways, or they will have to start a new win streak next week.

The Red River Shootout is one of the most heated rivalries in all of sports, filled with hatred. This year's battle between the No. 5 Longhorns and the No. 3 Sooners at the Cotton Bowl has added significance -a national championship is on the line. For the first time since 1984, both teams are in the top five going into the shootout. 
Texas and Oklahoma have won nine of the last 50 Associated Press National Championships. 
Both programs are in the top 10 in all-time wins and winning percentage. Names such as Brain Bozworth, Ricky Williams, Bud Wilkinson, Barry Switzer, and Darryl Royal add to the story of this rivalry. This year's teams will likely add to that list. Both squads are loaded with NFL talent. 
Oklahoma embarrassed Texas 63-14 last year at the Cotton Bowl. Current Sooner running back Quentin Griffin had six touchdowns in that game. Texas Head Coach Mack Brown said his team was "complacent" 
OTHER TOP GAMES 
Rorida at LSU 
So far, No. 2 Florida has looked unstoppable. However, the Gators looked unstoppable in 1997 until they went to Baton Rouge and fell to LSU. The No. 18 Tigers will look to pull off a bigger upset this Saturday. 
Last week, Rex Grossman became the first Florida quarterback to throw for 300 yards in four straight games. More impressively, he did that by halftime in 52-0 rout of Mississippi State, which boasted thP No. 1 pass defense going into the game. 
Despite a shaky pass defense, LSU has the fifth­ranked defense in the country, to go along with a tal­ented offense featuring Rohan Davey at quarterback. The Tigers played Tennessee tough in Knoxville last week, losing 26-18. 
Florida won't lose at home this season. 'But road games are a different story, and this appears to be the toughest for the Gators. LSU has the ability to pull off the upset, but need to play their best game to upset the Gators. 
Michigan at Penn State 
Penn State looks to avoid their first 0-4 start in school history when they take on the No. 15 Wolverines this Saturday. Joe Paterno has never lost four in a row at any point in the season. 
Paterno is still one win from tying Bear Bryant's all time victory mark as head coach at 323 victories. Even the legendary coach is hearing heavy criticism these days from the Penn State faithful. 
The Penn State offense is struggling. They have not scored more than one touchdown in a game this year. .... One of the two touchdowns versus Iowa came on a blocked punt return in a 28-14 loss last weekend. 
Michigan looked impressive in a 45-20 win over Illinois on Saturday. The defense is allowing only 58.5 yards rushing a game. 
Pew expected the Michigan offense to be able to put up 45 points against any team this year. Combined with their defense. Michigan is now the front-runner in the Big Ten. But don't count out "Joe Pa" and the Nittany Lions in Happy Valley on Saturday.
