Activity overload 
Our parents' generation often lament what they describe as the "apathetic youth" of today. 
We tend not to vote, and we certainly don't march on Washington waving ban­ners of peace. We • are not academi-Megan O'Neil cally engaged and rarely read books

in class. We prefer video games to award-winning foreign films and would chose a new episode of The O.C. over a lecture on global warming any day. 
Indeed, it seems that the more speak­ers the administration and faculty bring to campus, the fewer students are in attendance. 
Contrary to popular opinion, however, this is not because we don't care about issues such as the crisis in Sudan. It is simply because we are overwhelmed by all that is expected of us and all that we expect of ourselves. 
Take the month of February as an example. February is, among other things, Black History Month, American Heart Month, Marian Syndrome Awareness Month and Youth Leadership Month. Toss in National Eating Disorder Week along with Ash Wednesday and the beginning of Lent, and you have got yourself a very busy 28 days. 
All of these observances are accompa­nied by obligations which with we are pelted by various means of communica­tion. We are invited to "save a life" and donate blood. We are encouraged to attend a lecture on eating disorder inter­vention. We are given the opportunity to mentor a local youth. 
The catch phra<>e in all of this is of course "raising awareness." Groups want to raise awareness about violence against women, raise awareness about the death penalty and raise awareness about illiteracy in the United States. 
This is not to say that these things are not important and valuable -they cer­tainly are. 
At a certain moment, however, you simply reach a point of awareness fatigue. No matter how interesting or beneficial you know that lecture on the School of Americas will be, you simply cannot bring yourself to go. And the sight of yet another e-mail titled "Great volunteer opportunity" both irritates you and makes you feel guilty. 
Even when you do have a free hour or two during which to attend a lecture, the wide range of choices leaves you torn. 
Monday night at Saint Mary's there were showings of the films "Whale Rider" and "Lost in Translation," a lec­ture by the Humanistic Studies depart­ment called 'The Da Vmci Code: Cracked or Crack-pot," and a Lenten prayer serv­ice. 
After debating until the last minute I finally settled on "Whale Rider," which I loved and would recommend to any­body. But at the same time, I wondered if one of the other events would have been better. 
Perhaps ifthe incessant demands on our attention were reduced and we did­n't feel so skewed, student interest and participation in extra curricular activities such as those mentioned above would increase. 
Until then, we will continue as the so called apathetic youth.

Woman erroneously told husband died in Iraq 
SAVANNAH, Ga. -Military police are investigating a cruel hoax in which a man wearing an Army dress uni­form falsely told the wife of a soldier that her husband had been killed in Iraq. 
Investigators are trying to determine why the man delivered the false death notice and whether he was a soldier or a civilian wearing a military uniform. 
"We're taking it extremely seriously. Whatever motiva­tion was behind it, it was a sick thing to do," said Fort Stewart spokesman Lt. Col. Robert Whetstone. 
Last month, 19,000 sol­diers from the Fort Stewart­based 3rd Infantry Division deployed for their second tour of duty in Iraq. At least eight division soldiers have been killed since then. 
Fort Stewart officials would not identify the Army wife who reported to military police that a man posing as a casualty assistance officer came to her door Feb. 10. 
"Right off the bat, she noticed some things were not right," Whetstone said.

Mobile phones were also cut off. 
"This is not at all com­mon," said Hans Borjesson, a technician at TeliaSoneria.

Lecture kicks off University's inaugural Haiti Week 
By KATIE WAGNER 
News Wri1er 
Fatlwr Thomas Streit, the dime­Lor of Notre Dame's llaiti Pro~rram, Stophnn Silliman, a dvil engineer­ing and environmental geological seienens professor and senior Brian McElroy diseussed their Haiti work experionees in the Colman-Morse Center Lounge Monday at a kickofl" event lbr the University's first llaiti Wonk. 
Thn University's llaiti Pn>~rram is working on nlirninating lymphatic lilariiL<>is (LF), better known as ele­phantiasis, from the country and lwlping thos1~ pm>pln who already have eontraetnd the disnasn, Streit said. Thn program was startnd by Streit during the late 1990s and reenived a large grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 1999. 
"Lymphalie filariasis is one of tlw liv1~ disna'ins that am bnlievnd by Lhn world lmalth ~~oundl to be nliminabln." Streit said. "The Haiti program and Lhn biology depart­mont am primarily internstnd in, among many thinw>. thn elimina­tion of' a disew.;e."

.Jenkins dndined to list spndlic 
LF L<> an ancient disease spread by mosquitoes involving worms that are passed from mosquitoes to humans. The worm damages the lymphatic system, and the parts where the parasite is living can also be affected, such as the breasts, limbs <md genitals. 
"Everyone was surprised when we first starting looking to see how widespread the infection was. They Ithe medieal community! just didn't seem to see that much of elephantiasis," Streit said. "In real­ity of eourse many of the people with the disease, they stay at home, they hide the disease because it is so embarrassing, so ostracizing socially." 
The disease is linked to poor sanitation because the mosquito that spreads the disease lives in sewage water, Streit said. 
The I laiti program has been tak­ing on the enormous task of adding DEC, tlie drug that kills the parasitn carrying n: and iodine to the entire country's salt supply, Streit said. He added that his pro­gram's main objective is to "stop the parasite from affecting the next gonnration." · 
''I'm delighted to say that we've been able to participate with the 
qualitins he would pnrsonally seek in a provost, saying it is his role to listnn to others' input boli>re form­ing a judgment. 
"I think it's important as chair to keep a very open mind," he said. 
However, the president-elect acknowledged the value of finding a provost who will complement his own strengths and the strengths of Executive Vice Haitian government in building the capacity to as I've said to reach this holy grail of public health, actually eliminating the disease," he said. 
One way the Haiti program helps vietims of LF is by educating them on germ theory and hygiene. 
Streit said that at the Notre Dame residence where people in the program stay, he and mem­bers of the program have trained "hundreds and hundreds of patients" on how to deal with the infection. 
"We've increased the number of people we've been treating around the country every year until last year we reached over a million people," he said. "We also have eliminated the costs of our pro­gram." 
Silliman spoke about a separate Notre Dame program called the Haiti seminar, in which he pre­pares student<> at the University to repair hand-pumps in llaiti to try to prevent gastro-intestinal dis­eases caused by unfiltered water. 
lie said that every single well he has tested in the past 10 years has been contaminated with pathogens. 
Silliman also said that his group 
President Jolm Affieek-Graves, the third-ranking officer in the admin­istration. 
"In any working relationship you !try to seek] the skills you don't have," Jenkins said, adding that Affieck-Graves, who is not a member of the committee, will likely offer input on the search. 
A letter Jenkins sent to the fac­ulty last week asking for provost does more than simply teach the Haitians how to fix hand-pumps. 

"We work with the local popula­tion to develop local empower­m!mt," Silliman said. McElroy, an economics and political science major, discussed his experiences working with the small businesses of the Association of Fondwa in Fondwa, Haiti during the summer of 2003. He also taught English and computers with senior Danny Richter, recipient of the Alumni Association's Distinguished Student of the Year Award. 
McElroy will be spending the next year teaching English at the University of Fondwa, Haiti's first and only rural university. 
"The most wonderful thing about Haiti ... is the people," McElroy said. 
Streit and Silliman said that they learned a great deal from the Haitians. 
"We think there's a lot the University can offer and a lot that Haiti can do for the University," Streit said. "We want to invitP. other expertise within thn University that can help in the process of rebuilding Ilaiti Iafter many years ofstruggle!." 
Although undergraduate stu­
nominations has generated about 20 responses so far and should lead to more, he said. 
"In general they are very thoughtful. helpful letters," he said. 
The committee docs not have a formal overall plan for how fre­quently to convene, Jenkins said, but it will meet regularly with var­ious councils and individuals ­denl<> have not been able to work in Haiti for the past year and a half, currently thren rneent Notre Dame graduates are working thorn and Silliman and a group of ~rraduatn students will bn traveling to Ilaiti soon. 
"It's easy to come up with solu­tions here at thfl University ... but it's hard to apply those solutions to the developing world," Streit said.

the exam then the material wouldn't be as fresh in every­one's minds," Lawrence said. 
Another common reason cited by Lawrence and other professors was related to the mid-semester evaluations required for all first-year courses. According to Lawrence, grade reports must be submittBd by 3 p.m. on the Friday beforfl break. Becausfl there is no lapse in time, a stu­dflnt who performs poorly on the midterm exam may have a skewfld grade on their evalua­tion. 
"I need to submit mid-semes­ter grade reports for fresh­men," Lawrence said. "!Scheduling the exam early] allows me time to have anoth­er assignment due this week so that the mid-semester grade isn't based only on the midterm." 
In addition to providing a grace period for students seek­ing to improve grades with other assignments, early midterms also allow professors the adequate time to grade exams so evaluations can be given to the Registrar on dead­line. 
"I teach first-year students," physics professor Jacek Furdyna said. "I need to have some concrete basis on which to provide feedback to the Registrar on how first-year students are doing before the mid-semester break." 
Both Lawrence and Furdyna said another reason for hold­ing their respective exams early is to help students who may be swamped with exams in other classes during the conventional mid-term time slot. 
"Having mid-term exams that straddle the rush is the way to avoid overloading the students," Furdyna said. 
Junior Chelsea Ilorgan said from a learning perspective, scheduling exams over multi­ple weeks is a more rational means of testing students on what they know. 
"Staggering midterms is defi­nitely a better idea, because when [professors! lump all of the tests together, I feel less prepared for each one," Horgan said. 
When Lawrence taught his course four years ago, he scheduled the exam early in an attflmpt to relievfl stress from students who had multiple exams during the week before break. According to Lawrence, this strategy has sincfl been employed by numerous profes­sors and has thus backfired. 
"Inevitably other professors have had the same idea, and each semester many of my stu­dents have still had other exams at the same time," Lawrence said. 
Freshman J.T. Platek experi­enced this last week when he faced four mid-semester exams -two weeks prior to the typical time for midterms. Despite the onslaught of untimely tests, however, Platek remained optimistic. 
"''m happy [my exam sched­ule] was cluttered because now I can devote the next cou­ple weeks to lounging," Platek said. 
But according to Lawrence, other students may not share this glass-half-full perspective.

"Some students have been frustrated, but most of the time they realize that there's no perfect solution to the problem," Lawrence said. "The last week beforfl break may be the busiest but it's going to be pretty busy for a couple weeks there regardless of when the exams are scheduled." 
Regardless of the unplanned coordination of early exams, students like Horgan recognize that some professors -espe­cially of the higher-level cours­es -arfl basing their midterm schedules on student input. 
"Professors are giving us more of an option as to when the test is," Horgan said. "Freshman and sophomore year we didn't really have options but now professors give us possible test dates, and we get to vote when the best time is to take it."

llarris said Lynd, her friend since high school, left for the war in early September. Lynd enlisted in the Marine Corps as soon as he graduated high school, and Harris said the two have kept in close contact ever sincfl. 
"I send him mostly e-mails onlinfl, but my parents and family have been sending him a lot of food and stuff like that," Harris said. 
Harris said she chosfl to send Lynd items from the bookstore as gifl<> "out of convenience." 
"He said he wanted some­thing from the school," she said. "lie got the package after the New Year just because of the delay in getting there, and the picture was taken toward the end of January." 
The photograph depicts a group of Marines from the 1Oth Battalion, 2nd Division curmnt­ly stationfld in Iraq. The Marines, posed in front of a Humvee, are holding a largfl Saint Mary's stadium blanket and an American Gag. 
Harris chose to take the pic­ture to the bookstore at thfl urging of her roommates, who said it shows Saint Mary's pride.

U.S., Europe discuss disputes 
EU leaders and President disagree about 15-year arms embargo against China

BRUSSELS, Belgium ­President Bush and Europnan leaders settled simmering differences about Iraq but plunged into a troublesome new dispute Tuesday over the lifting of an arms embargo against China. Bush warned Congress might rotaliatn if Europe revokes tho 15-ynar ban.

Quake causes Iran homelessness 
Associated Press 
S/\RB/\GII, Iran -Under a eold, driving rain, survivors wailed over the bodies of the dead and dug through the ruins of mud-brick houses searching for their loved ones after a powerful earthquake Oattened villages in central Iran on Tuesday, killing at least 420 people. 
The toll was expected to rise, because rescue teams did not have a l'inal count from the three most isolated villages in the mountainous region. /\bout 30,000 people were affected, many left homeless when some villages were rod uecd to piles of dirt and stone by the magnitude­
6.4 earthquake. The number of injured was estimated at 900. 
"Where have you gone? I had a lot of plans for you," Ilossein Golestani sang softly as he hold the lifeless form of his 7-year-old daughter, Fatima. The body of his S-year-old daughter, Mariam, lay beside him in the devastated village of Hotkan. 
Golestani and his wife were out tending their herd of goats when the quake struck at 5:55 a.m., wrecking their home. 
Other survivors slapped their faees in grief as they sat next to tho dead, who were wrapped in bl<tn­kets in hospital morgues or on roadsides. 
Some 40 villages wnro damaged in tho quake, whieh struck a region 150 milns from Bam, site of a dev­astating earthquakn in December 200:~ that killed 26,000 people and leveled the historie city.

Pension plan worries workers 
Individual investment accounts could become mandatory in retirement plans 
Associated Press 
SACHAM ENTO, Calif. ­Gov. Arnold Schwarze­noger's proposal to over­haul the pension funds that 2.1 million California state ernployeP.S have long depPnded on, by convert­ing the funds into plans resembling 401 (k)s, has teachers, f'iref'ighters and other workers suddenly worried about their rP.tire­ment. 
Under tho proposal, whieh is pitting the gover­nor against government employee unions, Sehwar­znnegger wants to replace the nation's two largest public pension systems with private retirement plans similar to the 401 (k)s popular with busi­nesses. 

The proposal is designed in part to make up for the shortfall the pension funds have sul'f'erod in a strug­gling stock market. Because of subpar returns on their investments, as well as enhanced retire­ment benefits approved during good times, the state will be required to pay $2.6 billion this year into its largest pP.nsion fund, tho California Public Employees Retirement System, and another $1 billion in the teacher retirement system. nation's public pension San Francisco firefighter also struggling with gaps

ROTC 
continued from page 1 
cadets, who come from Valparaiso University, Indiana University South Bend (IUSB). Holy Cross College, Bethel College, Saint Mary's and Notre Dame, 20 to 25 percent are on full-tuition scholarship. The scholarships are awarded based on high school records and aca­demic standing. Another quarter of Air Force ROTC students are given an 80 percent scholarship, and the remaining 50 percent receive half tuition scholarships, said Colonel Mike Zenk, depart­ment chair of aerospace studies. 
Naval ROTC does not award partial scholarships -students are either on scholarship or they are not. These scholarships cover tuition, mandatory fees, a month­ly stipend and $600 a year for books. There are currently five cadets in naval HOTC participat­ing without a scholarship. 
Army HOTC is unique in that all students in the program receive full scholarships to match the yearly tuition, even with yearly tuition increases. 
This was not the case, however, in the late 1990s when the num­ber of full tuition Army ROTC scholarships dropped, largely due to the ceiling scholarship amount the Department of the Army was willing to pay for Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students at that time. 
"The iuition rate at NO and SMC surpassed the amount of scholarship benefits that the Army was willing to pay for our students," said Major Gary Masapollo, battalion executive officer of the Army ROTC pro­gram at Notre Dame. "We started to lose some of our prospects to other prestigious universities." 
But in 2002, the Department of the Army reinstated the full­tuition scholarship policy. Since then, numbers have been rising, Masapollo said. 
While Notre Dame students are given full tuition, scholarships for women participating in Army ROTC from Saint Mary's are capped at $20,000. 
Normal Students 
On top of early morning physi­cal training sessions, special Navy, Army or Air Force classes each semester and weekly Drill Laboratories, the men and women in ROTC are normal stu­dents. 
A common misperception is that students can major in ROTC, which is not the case, Masapollo said. 
"You can major in anything and still be in ROTC," said Zenk, who has cadets majoring in everything from psychology and English to political science and every type of Engineering. 
"Our students are pretty much like all the other students on cam­pus," Masapollo said. "They live in the residence halls, eat in the South or North dining hall, attend football games and study like everyone else. We try to minimize their training requirements dur­ing the school year so they can be students first and foremost." 
ROTC, much like varsity athlet­ics, is an outside activity that requires time but does not exclude participants from the duties of being a student. 
"You don't come here on a whim," Zenk said. "There is a seriousness to the students who participate in ROTC and [who] know that Notre Dame is aca­demically challenging." 
Misperceptions 
Many members of the ROTC community believe that there are other general misperceptions about the program that can be negative, including that students are being trained on how to kill indiscriminately, Masapollo said. 

"I truly believe that they would not have such a negative image of our programs if they would take the time to learn about what we really do over here to prepare our students for the modern complex­ities of warfare in the post-9/11 world that they are being placed into by our nation," said Masapollo, who returned to Notre Dame last March after being sta­tioned in Iraq. 
Each ROTC branch at Notre Dame stresses the similar idea of "God, Country, Notre Dame." While being prepared to serve their country, students are also being nurtured by the faculty, rectors, friends and ROTC cadre, which helps the young members to learn valuable lessons of serv­ice, Masapollo said. 
NROTC executive officer and assistant professor of naval sci­ence Commander Jeff Morris believes the members of the Notre Dame ROTC program receive top training on how to be strong leaders upon graduation. 
"Regardless of your stance on war and armed conflict, I think it's safe to say that the Notre Dame community .would rather see young men and women with like minds, values, and beliefs leading our armed forces today and in the future. especially with all the ethical and moral dilem­mas seen to date in Iraq and other areas," he said. 
Alumni network 
Each branch of ROTC has a broad alumni base. The Navy and Air Force both have wide and active databases of names, though the program itself is rather loosely organized. 
Army HOTC, on the other hand, has established a Notre Dame Alumni club of Iraq. Created in June, the club came out of an idea mentioned by Chuck Lennon, executive director of the Notre Dame Alumni Association, at the ROTC retreat in June. With the help of Bethany Heet, director of International Alumni Clubs, the club has grown, currently com­prised of about 35 graduat!~s. 
ROTC has long been an integral part of Notre Dame. 
"Our fAnny HOTCI heritage can be traced back to Father Sorin's original decision to train students in close-order drill in order to defend the newly-created univer­sity against the local Indian tribes," Masapollo said. "During all the major wars that America has fought in over the past 150 years, ND graduat!\S have serVf~d their nation with honor and dis­tinction." 
The Navy and Notre Dame have been partn!~red for more than 60 yp,ars. The United States Air Force established an Air Force HOTC in 1947.

.Jane Mason, vico prosidnnt for patient cam at Our Lady of Peace Hospital in South BPnd, nxpressed both admiration for the quality of the program and concern with the aging of cur­rent nurses in tho United States. 
"I think it is a quality pro­gram," Mason said. "And I think as a public person, and as a nurse who is hoping to retire someday, I have a vostod interest in the nurses of tomor­row." 
Community member Andma Johnson recounted tho care she received from Saint Mary's student nurses when she was hospitalized. 
"They were efl'icient, they were kind," Johnson said. "It really helped me, and I was able to go back and toll my doctor, and he was able to say something about it." 
When asked how the Saint Mary's nursing program com­pared to those at othor col­leges and universiti<\s, McGinn said the evaluators wern still compiling information and it was too early to say. 
"We have to go baek and put it all together," she said. "Every school has similarities and every school has differ­ences, so we're not mally ('.om­paring schools. We aro com­paring Ithe program I to the guidelines. So I can't really answer your question."

The horror, the horror. These famous fmal words from Joseph Conrad's disturb­ing novella "Heart of Darkness" are some of the most misunderstood and misquoted in history. In light of multiple appalling human tragedies in Peter contemporary African Quaranto 
history genocide in Rwanda, civil war in 
A Call to 
Congo and apartheid in Action South Africa to name a few, we have come to see the horror as synonymous with African barbarity. Yet, this mistake is not only a gross misreading of Conrad, but symptomatic of a naive, racist world vision. 
Conrad's novella is the story of a savvy businessman who, upon entering colonial Africa, turns into a cannibalistic, violent dictator who adorns his home with sev­ered black heads. It is a horrific tale based on the savage colonialism that Conrad himself witnessed in the Congo region. On one level, it shows the monstrous capacity that lies within all of us, placed in certafu . circumstances, to enslave, exploit and kill. On another level, it is a narrative of the brutal structures of colonialism that con­tinue to haunt the African continent. 
I now fmd myself upon that very conti­nent, braving stifling heat and less-than­reliable Internet cafes to write this col­umn. I am in Kampala, Uganda, studying development studies and the Lugandan language at Makerere University. I am studying here through the School for International Training, an academic insti­tution that believes in global exchange to build cross-cultural competencies. 
When most of us think about Africa, we are restricted to the headlines and short stories that occasionally grace the main­stream Western media. As a result, we know Africa as a place of wars, genocides, AIDS, diseases, corruption and perhaps exotic wildlife. Even such stories, howev­er, take a backseat to more important news like the Michael Jackson trial. 
There are two great dangers with limit­ing our knowledge of Africa to 30-second clips on CNN or 500-word New York Times articles. The first is that we miss the humanity that lives, loves, dreams, 
EDITORIAL CARTOON 

fears and works on this continent -a people of complex religions, cultures, tra­ditions, social norms, economic and politi­cal systems. The second is that we lump the whole continent -a massive land of more than fifty nations, hundreds of eth­nicities and thousands of languages ­together as one unit. 
In just three weeks, I have found the people of Kampala to be a people of friendliness, vitality, innovation and edu­cation. In terms of education, it has been amazing to hear how much Ugandans know about world affairs, especially those of the United States. One man explained the American electoral college system to me better than any Notre Dame political science professor. It is eye opening to real­ize how much the rest of the world knows about and is impacted by the slightest decisions in Washington. 
Uganda itself is a fascinating East African country, called the "pearl of Africa" by the late Winston Churchill. It is made up of more than 50 ethnic tribes, consolidated violently by their British col­onizers at the end of the 19th century. The country has three main religious groups -Catholics, Muslims and Protestants. Uganda received independence in 1962, followed by two tragic decades of civil strife and authoritarian dictatorships. In the last two decades, there has been peace and economic growth in the south, while an ugly, deadly civil conflict has raged in the northern regions. Dealing with that conflict, massive poverty and constitutional issues, the people of Uganda face an uncertain future. 
While it is important not to brood simply on the problems facing African communi­ties, it is equally important to not ignore them. The challenge, however, is to place these problems in their appropriate con­text, especially given influential historical processes. In the case of Africa, the vicious legacy of colonialism continues to destroy communities. Corrupt, inept gov­ernments of nepotism and authoritarian­ism arose from the colonial experience. The imposition of arbitrary borders has perpetuated civil conflicts, many of which have and will approach genocide. The dependency dynamic of colonialism con­
tinues to affect people, embedding sys­tems of poverty, inequality and xenopho­
bia. 
Today, forces of neo-colonialism com­pound the horrific legacy of colonialism. Such forces include unfair trade agree­ments from the West that create greater inequality between nations. Further, the Bretton Woods institutions IMF, World Bank and WTO promote liberalizing structural adjustment programs that fos­ter inequity, disable state social welfare mechanisms and push many countries deep into the abyss of debt. In many cases, humanitarian and other organiza­tions, consciously or not, are promoting structures of dependency that entrench colonial attitudes and norms. 
Certainly much more could be written about the challenges and opportunities facing modern Africa, not to mention those facing each country and community. In forthcoming columns this semester, I intend to explore some of these challenges and opportunities, especially in the case of Uganda. 
The challenge for all of us is to over­come our preconceived and ignorant gen­eralizations about people from different lands and backgrounds. Throughout much of the world, the United States is increasingly becoming alienated from the rest of the world community, which per­ceives post-Sept. 11 U.S. foreign policy as an imposing hegemonic force. So much good would come from a commitment to listening to and learning from the rest of the world. In doing so, we would not only heal countless global wounds, but break our hearts of darkness that continue to assent to a world of division, injustice and mass suffering.

February proves an embarrassment to the University 
Gnrwrally spmtking, I am morn than glad that Notre l>anw is not BnrkPiny, Calif. For one thing, our win­ters are not l'.ondueive to a nakml man lounging around Main Cirde. But more gt~nerally, that either body should ftwl compnllnd to beeome more like the otlwr is plainly ridiculous and prob­
ably elitist. Bnrkelny may be thn Lance Gallop quintessPntial Anwriean university, 
hut only a fool would ignorn the faet The Third Way 
that nwry wllngn has a distinet vahw. All this having hetm said, there is norwtlwless a common charaeter and pur­
posl' that all universities share. 
Fnhruary has been a month of controversies brought to our attention. Wn had thn Vagina Monologues and the (luner Film Festival, the aea­dnmkally suppn~ssivn ranting of a bishop and the violPnt donwstie dealings of one ex-Trustee. At a lwallhy school -not rwenssarily a Berkeley, but a school that rnllerts thn eharaetnr and personality of cUI autlwntic university-any one thnse events might haw lwPn nwt with opposition. At Notre Damn they wnrn nwt with a whimper and a sigh, or with nothing at all. 
Sornn people claim Notre Damn has an overly con­scorvatiw studt~nt body. If this wen~ true, then thn Monologucos and thn Film Festival would have found t.lwmsnlvt~s facing a strong consorvativn opposition. Instead tlwy found 15 sign-waving protestors stand­ing outsidn of South Dining llall. The Queen Mother of anti-Marian fnminist trash talk (apparently this is thn conservativn vinw of Ensler) storms the eity of Cod, and 0.14 pnreent of the eampus rises up in protnst. A spnetaeular event, dwarfed by Budy Hunttignr's last book signing. 
But from the sanw point of view, one cannot say Notrn Damn has an ovnrly liberal student body. If this were true. then where was the great outrage over the bishop pladng Notre Dame departmental presenta­tions on his personal index of banned books? Why are pro-ehoicn, pro-gay or anti-war sentiments met with. at best, casual interest (sometimes in the form of mockery) or at worst, total indifference? 
Thn truth of thfl matter is that, almost without nxenption, the best that Notre Dame students ean muster against almost anything, for one reason or another, they lind objeetionable is a handful of angry Viewpoint letters, and if we are lueky, a eouple of weeks of smoldering resentment. before we slip back into complaeency. And while I support events like the Monologues, I find it incredulous that our campus eannot even muster an outcry against some­thing that, in the eyes of a nontrivial por­tion of our student body, represents a direct attack against our core val­ues and beliefs. To be perfectly honest. I find the whole alTair to be both pathetic and embar­rassing. 
Are we even a University anymore'? I mean this quite seriously. I ean still recall a speech that University President Father Edward Malloy made during open­ing events when I was a freshman. lie remarked it is one of the functions of a university to cause stu­dents to question their deeply held belinl's, that in questioning them, and eventually understanding them, what they flnd up holding they might believe in truth. A university, by defini­tion, weighs, reacts to and judges the world. Yes I see pre­cious little of this at Notre Dame, and in the face of' our complaceney, I wonder if the students here aetually believe in anything. 
Sure, we talk as though we eare about events taking place around us. One will lind no short­age of symposiums, panels and artistic events, where students can discuss signilieant issues with delibera­tion, and then promptly forget them the moment they return to their normal lives. It is a truism that actions are more important than words, and that the day-to-day is more significant that the occasional, but our student body has no actions to backup our "deep-held beliefs," and in no way expresses those beliefs in it day-to-day affairs. 

Takfl our student government. That body spends weeks upon weeks debating a plan to afford students the luxury of purehasing four fewer meals eaeh 
weeks, while it eontinually ignores the morn 
signilieant questions of whether or not it has any relevance to students any­more or whether it is merely a 
source of bureaucracy and the consoling illusion that students 
have a real vokn. If we worn to lose our "represnntation" tomorrow, would it mnan 
anything? Would anyone earn? I wonder, should tho 
worst-ease scenario arisn and Notrn Damn students beeome forced to take a stand for what they believe in (be it liberal, consnrvative or other­wise), would anyorw havt~ 

the courage to do so? Is i1 worth it to any of us to givn up friends, or rnspnct, or the livelihood of' our col­lege degree for such a eause'? lias tlw University instilled in us the nssnntial eharaeter, the necessary virtue, to be this kind of a believer, or havo the empty goals of our "cre­dentials generation" and the thou­sand little ways in whieh we are encour­aged to be complacent destroyed this? Is Notre Dame a university anymore?

Each of the three great religions of the Bible set aside a time to celebrate eentral moments it is essen­tial to remernbor through additional praym, spedal concnrn for tho poor and self sacrifice. We are made in tlw image and likeness of God, and St. Paul assuros us that "God sees and loves in us what God snes and loves in Jesus" who "is like us in every way except for sin." The first Lenten prefaee reminds us that oaeh year we aro invited to celebrate Lent as a "joyful season when we prnpare to celebrate the paschal mystery with mind and heart renewed." Our mind is rnnewnd when we study and undnrstand more deeply our call to be a beloved son or daughter of God. Our purified heart rejoiees in the realization oncn again of how mueh God lovns us unconditionally and wants us to spend etnrnity praising his goodness and seeing God face to faee in the company of family and friends. 
The preface gotlS on to make a spectaeular daim. "As we recall the great events that gave us new life in Christ, you bring the image of Christ to perfection within us." As a result of our Lenten praetiees-our prayer, our fasting and our care for tho poor-we not only become more like Jesus in our words and adions, but everything God sees and loves in us can be a mirror image of what God sees in Ilis Son! This is at the heart of what it means to be a disciple. This is the essence of the moment of' our baptism when we were individually set apart as one of God's chosen ones, with the call to become one with Jesus during the course of our lives. 
What is important is that we make our best efforts to maintain our Lenten practiees for the next 

four weeks. We should never become dis­

Jen Chapin's strong voice enchants audience 
'Urban Jazz' artist from New York opens Spring ARTS fest promoting 'Tolerance and Reconciliation' 

By CHRIS McGRADY 
Scene Writer 
Jen Chapin, the opening act in a two-week series of music, film and theatre based on promoting "Tolerance and Reconciliation," started off her portion of Spring ARTSfest with a bang. 
Chapin, who can most accu­rately be described as a mix of Jewel, Norah Jones and Alanis Morissette with a cause, is an "Urban Jazz" artist from New York. 
Notre Dame was one of the sev­eral stops on her tour of the Midwest. Chapin is a chairperson for the World Hunger Year (WilY), which seeks to rid the world of unnecessary hunger. Chapin uses her musical talent as an apparatus in the development of this program. 
Appearing on stage in an all­black outfit, Chapin radiated a dark vibe at first sight, but her music proved to be different. Although initially reserved on stage, Chapin warmed up to the audience and performed a series of love songs to open her first set. She mixed many musical genres and layered hints of rock, soul and folk music into the promi­nently jazz-flavored blend that comprises the majority of her music. 
Chapin elegantly gave off a feel­ing of being both playful and sui­try. Her music seemed to almost control her at times. Her soulful style of singing was pure and unadulterated, and instead of relying on gimmicks to lure in the audience, she let her voice do the work. A guitar and bass accom­paniment were more than enough to produce a rich full sound. Her song "Good at Love" opened with eclectic guitar riffs that captured the audience before Chapin mes­merized the crowd with her beautiful voice. 
After a brief intermission, Chapin returned to the stage, this time with only the bassist, Stephan Crump. Her music was just as, if not more, captivating at this point than it had been with the guitar accompaniment. With only the bass as a backup her fluid voice rang out just as clearly as before, striking each note with impeccable clarity and accuracy. 
Guitarist Jamie Fox returned to the stage after this interlude and showcased his impressive vocals, singing with Chapin. Crump, on upright bass, helped to provide a soulful feel to the music. His jazzy riffs were impeccably timed and full of emotion. Fox provided guitar for the trio and was equal­ly impressive. He played beauti­fully for the entire concert and never missed a note. However, Chapin's. rich voice was more than enough to fill the concert hall. For one song, Chapin even played a guitar of her own and continued to sing just as skillfully as before. 
Although Chapin played a few older songs from previous albums, she concentrated mainly on songs from her most recent album "Linger," the title track of which is "Little Hours." Chapin delighted the crowd by playing two previously unrecorded tracks and provided the audience with background to each one of her songs, which ranged from her playful childhood experiences on Long Island to soulful renditions of her adult love life. The audi­ence got the feeling that Chapin really wrote the music she lived and lived the music she wrote. 
Chapin could be on the verge of something big. She controlled the audience with her vocal range and talent, and although she does not perform a typical style of mainstream popular music, Chapin has the vocal and lyrical ability to be a star in her genre. Both Crump and Fox have impressive musical backgrounds and provide more than ample tal­ent to accompany Chapin, as if she needed any extra help. 
In one of her songs, Chapin sang, "I wait to see. Is there any­one out there?" The answer to Jen Chapin is yes, they're out there -and now they're listen­ing.

Major Notre Dame choirs 
JOin VOICeS 
'A Joint Concert' will dedicate the Leighton Concert Hall 
By lAUREN WENDEL Scene Writer 
One rarely has the opportunity to hear several accomplished musicians perform masterpieces of clas­sical music, let alone to hear them in one arena. 
The Notre Dame department of music is providing the opportunity to do just that on Saturday in "A Joint Concert" at 8 p.m. in the Leighton Concert Hall. It will mark the official "big bang event" by Notre Dame ensembles and soloists to inaugurate the Debartolo Center for the Performing Arts. 
The event will feature a wide range of performers including the Notre Dame Symphony Orchestra lead by Daniel Stowe, the Notre Dame Chorale lead by Alex Blachly, the Notre Dame Glee Club, the Notre Dame Liturgical Choir lead by Gail Walton and the Women's Liturgieal Choir. Three aecomplished soloists, Carolyn Plummer (violin), Karen Buranskas (cello) and John Blacklow (piano), will also showcase their talents for the community. 
The set will include some of the finest elassieal music composed from the First Viennese School. The orehestra, comprised of about 60 musicians from the student body, faculty and staff, will skillfully display the wit and color of Mozart's "Overture to Die Zaubertlote" (Overture~ to Magic Flute). The orehestra will also· provide background accompaniment for the three soloist musicians on Beethoven's "Triple Concerto," as well as for the collaborative effort of all the singing ensembles in Haydn's "Harmoniemesse." 
These groups were brought together by the depart­ment of music to commemorate the opening of the new Center for the Performing Arts with a gala event "using our own forces" according to music director Alex Blachly. 
"We want to change the feeling of what Notre Dame and the [surrounding] area stands for in music -to show that people do not have to travel to Chicago or other places to listen to elassical music performed on this scale," he said. 
The Notre Dame Chorale has been preparing Haydn's material for the past two years, singing four out of the five movements between fall and spring per­formances. The group is comprised of 55 voices spe­cializing in choral works from the Renaissance to present. Combined with the Glee Club, Liturgical Choir and Women's Liturgical Choir, there will be over 200 voices singing at once, lending to a powerful and over­whelmingly inspiring force of music that should not disappoint. 
Haydn's last major work, "Harmoniemesse," high­lights his range of options and strengths as a compos­er, particularly with the winds. The name of the work "Harmoniemesse" is derived directly from this choir of winds or "harmonie." Haydn is often noted for his tal­ent for surprise and striking effects of the composition that leave even the most knowledgeable musician stunned. Three graduate students and one undergrad­uate student from the music department will perform solos in this piece, directly illustrating the healthy state of music performance on campus. 
The three accomplished soloists -Plummer, Buranskas and Blacklow -will prove to be one of many highlights of the concert. Performing Beethoven's powerful and simplistically sophisticated "Triple Concerto" simultaneously with the Symphony Orchestra will provide an intimate yet dramatic set­ting. The concert hall itself lends to creating a cham­ber arrangement but also gives the illusion of a large orchestra. A three dimensionality is at play with this performance in particular, which will emphasize the skill level of each musician and produce a powerful experience for the listening pleasure of the audience. 
The combination of these concerto ensembles will prove to be an unforgettable experience. Blachly describes the experience perfectly saying, "once you experience and hear a new form of music, you want to repeat it and hear more." 
Tickets are on sale at the Debartolo Center for the Performing Arts at $3 for students and $6 for general public.

By MARIA SMITH Scene Editor 
There was a time when jazz signified a lil'estylo and rode the cutting edge of' popular music. 
Now the art seems to havn ag1~d and lost its popular hype. The jazz greats, along with the New York Philharmonie, have been relegated to the respectable halls of thn DeBartolo Center for the Performing Arts, where the current high rollers of popular music would never be invited. 
The Collngiate Jazz Festival also has aged since its cn~ation in 1959. But dropping into Washington llall this weekend will prove to anyone while the musie and the people who play it may age, nnithnr will ever really be old. 
This year's festival will, as always, feature a varinty of talented groups. Ensembles sometimes come from as far as Texas, Alaska and Hawaii to per­form in the oldest eollegiate jazz festi­val in the United States. Other groups, such as the ensembles from Western Michigan University and the University of Illinois, may not have traveled far and may not sound exotic but have given fantastic performances for years. 
Five respected musicians will also come in to judge the festival. Trumpet player Andre Hayward, saxophonist Frank Catalino, pianist Lynne Arriale, bassist Jay Anderson and drummer Steve Davis will perform in the tradi­tional Judges' Jam on Friday night. 
I lowever, this year the festival also will welcome some of the original per­formers back with a performance by a quintet of Notre Dame alumni from the early days of the festival. Trumpet player Bruce Cosaechi, pianist Charlie Prawdzik and drummer Jack Carr all performed in the first festival, while bassist Hayes Kavanagh first per­formed in the third festival and trom­bone player AI Iiermann first per­formed in the fourth. 
Only Prawdzik has continued to make a living as a musician. Cosaechi served in the FBI for 25 years, IIermann is a professor of physics at the University of Colorado, Carr worked in advertising for 35 years and Kavanagh heads a law firm in New York City. Nevertheless, all have main­tained their ties to musie over the years. Cosacchi and Carr have begun to play with numerous bands since their retirement. Kavanagh organizes parties and eoncerls with jazz all-stars. IIermann. who has performed with Bill Clinton and Ella Fitzgerald, continues to perform at music festivals around the world. 
For these musicians, and for Larry Dwyer, a Notre Dame musie professor specializing in jazz, the festival 1wokes a lot of memories. 
Dwyer, who performed in the festival from 1963-66, n~members a time before the Judges' Jam, whieh doses the Friday session, was an oflkial part of the festival and when the judges included greats like Quincy Jones, Henry Mancini and Wynton Marsalis. 
"When I was a student, the jam exist­ed, but it wasn't organized," Dwyer said. "People would go someplace, like the basement of Christ the King chureh. There'd be this ugly old piano, and people would just play. Herbie Hancock played there, and students used to play with the judges. Now we just build it into the program. It's really a fabulous part of what happens." 
Carr remembers pulling IIermann out of his shell to perform in the last festival before their graduation in 1962. 
"We were playing one school year, and we said, 'Oh AI, go and get your horn,"' Carr said. "lie got his horn and brought it out. We didn't expeet much from this kid who hadn't played sinee high school. It knoeked us over the way he pl~;r<~d. We wondered where he had been. 
In its early days, Carr remembers the festival bringing in a lot of New Orleans-style Dixieland jazz. Nowadays groups cover the jazz spectrum, and one never knows what he will hear. 
"We get some mellow jazz, jazz roek, straight ahead mainstream, some con­temporary and avant garde jazz," Dwyer said. "The contrast and variety are amazing. If you don't like one group you're guaranteed to like the next." 
The judges combo and the alumni combo might even surprise themselves, since neither group will ever have played as an ensemble. But in jazz, of course, that's the beauty of the game. 
"You'll hear it for the frrst time when we do." Carr said. "But one of the ten­ants of jazz is freedom and improvisa­tion, and whatever happens you play along with it. We'll pick some tunes, pick the key, and that's how you start."

By MAUREEN MALLOY Scene Wrirer 
For those who wondnr how many limns people are going to re!"er to Napoleon Dynamite every single time they servo later tots or "dang quesa-dilluhs" in the dining hall, a sweet Napoleon Dynamite party may be in order. 
An occasion like this dnfinitely calls for some en~alivn costuming. Browse thrift stores and your friends' rlosnts in search of' a brown polyester suit, SOs style prom drnss«~s. Arnnriean flag warm ups and whatnvnr other Napoleon Dynamitn-themnd dotlws you can lind. Mock Napoleon afros, lopsided bangs and side ponytails are a must! Gnt creative and play "Pin the Casserole on Tina" and post "Vote for Pedro" f'lynrs around llw room. 
Food for this party is pretty low key. If you want to be authnntic, you ~~an zip up sorno dining hall lots in your poeknls and servo them on paper plates.

And of coursn you have to snrw those "dang quesa-dilluhs." Wash it all down with l pnr­~~ent milk, but I don't rneommend serving lhn egg punch. And remember whoever attends as Napoleon owes the party a performance of D-Kwon's dance grooves. llern are somn redpes to get your party slartml.

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -Barry Bonds angrily sidestepped questions about his role in baseball's steroid scandal upon his arrival at spring training Tuesday. pronouncing himself weary but ready to begin his pursuit of Hank Aaron's home run record. 
In the 40-year-old Bonds' first pub­lic comments since his grand jury testimony was leaked to the San Francisco Chronicle and reported in December. he had nothing to say about it, citing legal constrictions. But he had harsh words for the media and fans still consumed by the circumstances of his record -setting home run binge. 
"You guys are like re-running sto­ries," Bonds said to the huge group of reporters in attendance. "This is old

Chargers release WR Dwight 
SAN DIEGO -The San Diego Chargers released receiver-returner 11m Dwight on Tuesday after four injury-marred sea­sons. 
Dwight was slowed last season by toe and hamstring injuries, and sustained a collapsed lung in both the 2001 and 2003 seasons. 
Dwight returned 50 kickoffs last season for a 24.4-yard average and one touch­down on an 87 -yard return against the New York Jets. lie caught just two passes, including one for a 23-yard touchdown. 
IIc started 19 games with the Chargers, caught 91 passes and scored seven touchdowns -three receiving, two rush­ing, one kickoff return and one punt return. 
Dwight was obtained the day before the 2001 draft in a deal that sent the No. 1 pick to the Atlanta Falcons. The Falcons used the pick on Michael Vick. and the Chargers used the filth pick overall on l,aDainian Tomlinson. 
stuff. It's like watching 'Sanford and Son.' ... It's almost comical, basical­ly." 
The San Francisco Giants slugger, who has 703 homers. also is on the verge of catching Babe Huth, who is second on baseball's career list with 
714. Aaron is first with 755. 
"The sad part, I just want to go out there and play baseball," Bonds said. "I don't even care about the record part so much. The best is whatever you get out of yourself. That's all I'm trying to do.'' 
According to the San Francisco Chronicle, Bonds testified to the grand jury in December 2003 that he used a clear substance and a cream given to him by a trainer who was indicted in a steroid-distribution ring, but said he didn't know if they were steroids. Prosecutors believe the sub-

The four players. who will not accompany the team on the trip to Columbia, violated the same rule, which Patten stated is strictly internal to the team and involved no outside agencies. 
"I learned Saturday evening that the four had violated team rules prior to the Texa.c;; A&M game," said Patten of the Buffaloes' 92-77 setback to the Aggies, their second loss in their last three games. 
Chris Copeland, the club's second­leading scorer at 12.6 points per game, and Marcus Hall, the team leader in assists and third-leading scorer at 11.9. were among the players suspended.

Bonds repeatedly refused to speak directly about it, but he castigated cvr.ryonc frorn.thc media to Jose Cansr.co, whose recently released book described a rampant culture of steroid abuse in baseball. 
"I don't know Canseco. besides hello and goodbye. I don't put any weight into what he says," Bonds said. "Mark McGwirc was a big boy in college. To me, Canseco, you've got to come with a whole lot more.... It's to make a buck. that's all it is. 
"I don't know Jose. I was better than Jose then, and I've been better than him his whole career. ([' he wants to go make money, go ahead. ... For somr.body who brags about what he did, I don't sec any of your records.''

You would be hard pressed to find a young man who models a life of faith and conviction as well as Richard Hinkley. Richard has been a member of the Notre Dame Liturgical Choir since his soph­omore year. As a member of the choir he demonstrates a superb work ethic and is always well-prepared for rehearsals and liturgies. However, it is Richard's kindness to other members of the choir, his genuine interest in making other students' lives easier by listen­
ments were reduced to abstinence on all Fridays of Lent and fasting on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday. However, Friday absti­nence (or some form of penance or self-denial) throughout the year is still encouraged. 
Through our Lenten practices of fasting and absti­nence, the Catholic Church offers us a regular opportunity to deny ourselves, so that we might hcttcr mold our lives after the life of Jesus. Send your questions to pcrkins.26@nd.cdu!

take the off week too lightly. 
"It's pretty nice having a cou­ple days off, but we don't want to get too relaxed because we know we can get out of shape pretty easily," the senior said. "We have still quite a few games to go hopefully, so we can't sit back on our heels." 
Notre Dame's string of games began with Northern Illinois and saw the team face Connecticut, Boston College and Rutgers twice and Purdue and Villanova once. 
Notre Dame has just two reg­ular season game remaining ­West Virginia at home Saturday and a March 1 date against Seton Hall. Then the Irish have the Big East tournament during spring break before the NCAA Tournament begins March 19 and 20. 

"The whole season is like a marathon -it keeps on going and going," Borton said. 
Last week, Irish coach Muffet McGraw said such a long stretch of games can wear a player down physically and mentally. Tuesday, Borton echoed her coach's comments. 
"You have to be physically tough as well as mentally tough because academics come into play, and wins and losses takes a toll on you mentally," she said. 
The Irish watched film and practiced Tuesday after having Monday off. They will also take today off before practicing Thursday in preparation for the final home game Saturday. Assistant coach Coquese Washington ran practice 



Ryan Grant, left, and Mike Goolsby were invited to the NFL Combine that starts today and continues until March 1.

In 2004, Collins played a backup role at a deep tight end position, catching six passes for 67 yards. 
Goolsby played in 4 7 games for Notre Dame, starting 25 games at linebacker. The Joliet, Ill. native led Notre Dame with 

...... 97 tackles and two intercep­tions in 2004 after missing the 2003 season due to a broken collarbone. Grant, who split time with freshman Darius Walker at tail­back in 2004, finished his career No. 11 on the Irish all­time rushing list 2,220 yards. His 18 rushing touchdowns rank tied at No. 10 with former 
Irish back Randy Kinder. Grant was a starter for most of the past three seasons, rushing for over 100 yards five times. The Nyack, N.Y. native is one of only seven players in school history to rush for more than 1,000 yards in a season (1,085 in 2002). 
Eight Notre Dame players were invited to the combine last year, and five of those players remain on NFL rosters. The five players are defensive tackle Darrell Campbell (Chicago), strong safety Glenn Earl (Houston), running back Julius Jones (Cowboys), offensive tack­le Jim Molinaro (Washington) and linebacker Courtney Watson (New Orleans).

because of McGraw's absence. McGraw was with family after her father's death last week­end. 
Notre Dame lost to Rutgers 59-48 Saturday and dropped from first place in the Big East conference regular season standings. Barring a collapse against two 6-7 conference teams in their final two games, the Irish should have at least a No. 3 seed for the Big East tournament. An impressive showing in the tournament should help Notre Dame gain a high seed for the NCAA bracket -likely a No. 2 or No. 3 pill.

NO WOMEN'S TENNIS 
Top twins 
Thompsons become first No. 1 doubles team in program history 

By DAN TAPETILLO Sports Writer 

For the first time in the pro­gram's history, the Irish have claimed the No. 1 national ranking in women's doubles. 
Sophomores Catrina and Christian Thompson overtook the former No. 1 doubles team of Cristelle Grier and Audra Cohen from Northwestern 
after the Wildcats duo lost twice this month, dropping them to No. 2 in the nation. 
"I knew it was going to be tough to surpass the No. 1 team," Christian Thompson said. "But I knew we had to go out to every match with confi­dence in order to have a great season." 
The Thompsons were last ranked No. 2 in the Intercollegiate Tennis 
Association national doubles rankings, but have gone 8-0 this spring to improve to 16-2 on the season. The Thompsons hold an 11-1 record against nationally-ranked teams, including six victories against top-15 opponents.

Finally, the Irish can take a deep breath. 

After having no more than three straight days without a game ­and that doesn't include traveling time -Notre Dame is in the mid­dle of a much-deserved week off. 
The Irish (23-4) have played 16 games in the last 52 days, dating back to a Dec. 30 victory against Northern Illinois, with half those games on the road and seven against ranked opponents. Notre Dame holds a 7-3 record for the entire season against top-25 opponents. 
The grueling regular season schedule has worn on the team, tri-captain Teresa Borton said, but she doesn't think the Irish will

Irish edge Spartans 
4-3 in East Lansing 
Singles play key role in victory over Michigan State 
By KATE GALES 
Sports Writer 
A third match is a tense time for any tennis player. But when the score is tied 3-3 and an arena's atten­tion is focused on one match-up to decide the out­come of team play, the pressure is immeasurable. 
Patrick Buchanan rose to the occasion Tuesday night in East Lansing, Mich., coming through in the final set of the final match to secure a 4-3 victory for the No. 23 Irish over No. 46 Michigan State. 
"It came down to the last guys on the court and it was a very dramatic finish," Irish coach Bobby Bayliss

Four players receive invites to Combine 
Collins, Goolsby, Grant, Tuck all to test NFL waters 
By PAT LEONARD Associate SportS Editor 
Four former Notre Dame football players have been invited to the 2005 National Football League Combine that starts today at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis. Tight end Jerome Collins, linebacker Mike Goolsby, running back Ryan Grant and defensive end Justin Tuck all will par­ticipate in the weeklong try­outs, ending March 1. 
Goolsby, Grant and Tuck were starters for the Irish in 2004, while Collins played special teams and blocked three punts in 11 games. 
Tuck, who was named the Notre Dame Monogram Club Most Valuable Player in 2004 by his teammates, broke the Notre Dame career sack record this season, register­ing 24.5 sacks in three sea­sons. During the coaching change from former Irish head coach Tyrone Willingham to new coach Charlie Weis, the Kellyton, Ala. native decided to forgo his final year of eligibility to enter the NFL draft. 
Collins played in 46 games during his Notre Dame career. The Warrenville, Ill. native played wide receiver in high school and moved to linebacker when he joined the Irish. Collins later played some time at defensive end, as well. In 35 games at line­backer and the end position, he made 14 total tackles (11 solo).
