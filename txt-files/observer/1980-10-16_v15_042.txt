Quayle rails at Detnocratic policies 
by Mtlr)' Frrm Callahrm Smior Staff Reporter 
Republican senatorial candi­date Dan Quayle campaigned last night to a crowd of thirty, slinging mud at democratic constituents while simultaneous­ly stressing his own plans for the "challenge of the eighties." 
Quayle opened his presenta­tion, held at the Galvin Auditorium, by outlining what he perceived as the significant challenges of the decade. 
He called for a consolidation of federal bureaucracies while em­phasizing that he was "proud".he led the fight to kill Ralph Nader's consumer efforts from blossom­ing into a full-fledged federal agency. 
The candidate also discussed the "need for limitations of taxes" by stressing that taxcuts are not only needed for individu­
He then began attacking his opponent incumbent Birch Bayh by quoting some statistics that he attributed to Governor Bowen. 
Quayle cited 13 percent in­flation, 12 percent unemplo:y­ment, overregulation, overtaxa­tion and weak national defense.

Economist wins eighth 
U.S. Nobel Prize 
STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP ) -U.S. economist Lawrence R. Klein, whose models for fore­casting economic trends re­volutionized the field, capped a strong American showing in the 1980 Nobel Prize series yester­day by winning the economics award.

Arsenic murders 



FBI searches for insane poisoner 
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP)­Audrey Marie Hilley, charged with using arsenic to poison her daughter, who survived, and suspected of doing the same to several other relatives, who didn't, has been missing without a trace for almost one year. 
The 19-state search for the woman is complicated by in­vestigators' growing suspicion that the Audrey Marie Hilley who disappeared from a Birmingham motel last November may be quite a different person today. 

The only thing Hilley left behind at the motel was a note. Investigators won't release its contents, but say the scribbled message makes them believe Hilley is living a life where she "changes her personality to fit her surroundings." 
"She can be kind, laughing, 
considerate and then brutal and 
hateful," said the FBI agent who 
is coordinating the coast-to­
-coast search for Hilley. 
"We believe she is living in a 
world with make-believe friends 
and enemies. When she reads 
this, if it's the real Marie Hilley, 
she will probably change her 
personality when she realizes 
what she is accused of doing." 
The 47-year-old Anniston 
woman, charged with unlawful 
flight to avoid prosecution for 
murder and attempted poison­
ing, is being hunted coast-to­

coast by the FBI and 28 other federal divisions. 
The FBI warrant against Hilley stems from a Calhoun County indictment of Oct. 25, 1979, charging her with trying to poison her 20-year-old daughter, Carol Marie Hilley, with arsenic. 
On Nov. 16, Hilley disappear­ed from the suburban motel where she was living while awaiting trial, free on $14,000 bond. On Jan. 11, a Calhoun County grand jury indicted her on murder diarges for the 1975 arsenic poisoning of her hus­
band, Frank. She has also been indicted for check fraud. 
The FBI agent, who asked not to be identified, has followed several hundred leads since the search began in January, all in vain. 
"It's not likely I'll arrest Hilley. An agent in another state will most likely arrest her," he said. "But ifthe real Marie Hilley reads this she will likely change her personality or relocate or get careless and hopefully we'll find her." 
The agent said that interviews

The Most Reverend William E. McManus, Bishop of F6rt Wavne South Bend Diocese, will bless the ground, and the Women's Choir under the direction of Raymond Sprague will sing for the ceremony.

an essential resource which 
could no longer be delayed 
because of our increased student 
population and our expanded 
library collection." 

The groundbreaking cere­mony ends five years of research and planning for the new building to replace the Alumnae Centennial Library built in 1942. The old library was built to hold only 80,000 volumes and now ·overflows with 150,000 books, many ofwhich must be stored in other buildings on the campus. When the new library is co~­pleted the college. plans to con­vert the old building into a 
college center. 

Evans Woolen Associates are 
the architects of the new library 
which will accommodate ap­
proximately 250,000 volumes. It 
will also provide group study 
rooms and a lounge area with 
vending machines. The audio­
visual department will be ex­
panded and the archives will be 
moved from Regina hall to the 
new building. A 24-hour study area in the library will be con­nected toLe Mans hall by a walk­through tunnel system. 
Sollitt construction Company is working as construction manager for the project. 
On September 24 the College received a check for $5.5 million from the sale ofbonds to finance construction. Fundraising effort­s are underway to retire the bonds, and the college has al­ready received gifts in excess of $3.25 million.

Civic leaders meet to reassure blacks after n1urder of children 
ATLANTA (AP) -Civic lead­ers rallied yesterday in an effort to calm what the mayor called "a feeling of frustration and isola­tion "among low-income blacks that was aroused by the murders of eight black children and heightened by a deadly furnace explosion. 
Even as the rubble of the Gate City Day Care Center, located in a low-income housing project in 
: a predominantly black neighbor­hood, was being cleared, a rumble of rumors brought top city officials to the scene to try to calm the fears of residents. Four black pre-school children and one adult were killed in the explosion Monday. Already dealing with public outcry about the unsolved mur­ders of eight black children and the disappearance of six others,· officials now are faced with growing frustration among blacks who have expressed fear that the incidents somehow are connected. The bodies of the eight children have been found in various areas of the city. None has been found in the immediate 
area of the explosion. 
To stem fears raised by the explosion, Jackson and Public Safety Commissioner Lee Brown, who like most of the city's police hierarchy also is black, mingled in an angry crowd Monday, assuring residents that the explosion was an accident caused by a faulty furnace. 
"There is nothing at all to indicate that the explosion was the result of foul play," Brown told the group. 
But the statements have drawn 
skepticism from many area resid­
ents. 
"I don't kriow what happen­ed," said Charles Davis, a resid­ent of tbe housing project. "But even 1.-1t happened like they say it did, tht: people don't believe 
it." 
Davis' concerns were echoed 
by many attending a parents' 
meeting Monday night, and by 
many others who called a rumor 
control number set up by Jack­
son at the city's Civil Defense 
headquarters. 
Monday's explosion came on the heels oflast week's discovery ofthe body of12-yearold Charles Stephens, the eighth black child found dead in the metropolitan area in 14 months. 
Police have created a special task force to work solely on those cases.

P.O.BoxQ 
No standing . 

and definitely no parking 
Dear Edrtor, 
Once again, the policies of Notre Dame have made some­one unhappy. I am very upset becauseI have beenforced to pay a $50 traffic violation for failing to promptly obtain a s~dent decal for my car. I submitted a written appeal ofmy violation to the Traffic and Parking Appeals Board. This appeal was quickly turned down. 
In a second appeal, I stated my case verbally in front of the Board, and was told I was guilty. in the eyes of the Board. I then wrote a check to the Traffic Violations Bureau for $50. Thus, 

I  have  nothing left  to do but  
compla in out loud.  
The  University's  policy  on  

.registering student cars is that the students must register their cars (i.e. show proof of owner­ship and insurance coverage, and pay the $25 fee) within five days after bringing the car to campus. If this five day deadline is not met, the student is subject to a 
$50 no decal violation. 

Needless to say, I violated this rule and got nailed. But I don't want to argue my case any further. It is over and done with, and I have paid the $50 fine (and also the $25 registration fee). What I do want to do is·question some of the traffic laws around this place. 
First of all, where does any­body get the right to chargefifty dollars for not obtaining a decal on time? Doesn't that seem a little high? It is tied with 
falsifying or altering decals or lying on the registration application as the highest fine a student can receive. Ifone drives on campus without permission or parks in the wrong lot on a football weekend, the fine is $25. If the decal is "affixed im­properly" to a car, the fine is also $25. 
Interestingly enough, reckless driving (a combination of two or more violations or endangering life orproperty whtle driving is also $25. Speeding is a mere $10. Some­how, these fines strike me as being a little inconsistent. 
Now, the above fines apply only to students. The faculty and staffviolations are another story. The policy is that any faculty or staffmember who has chalked up three citations will receive a $10 fine. The first two citations serve as "warning citations." 
I don't want to jump to con­clusion's, but this smacks of a double standard. I don't know why or how this rule came about, but there seems to be plenty of room for skeoticism. 

Well, that is about all I have to say. Fron1 start to finish, my tangle with the Security Office and the Traffic Violations Bureau has been one long "bend over and grab 'em" type situa­tion. Basically, I am perturbed. Does anyone else out there feel unhappy with ridiculous fines they have received? Has anyone gotten angry while trying to get a car on campus? Ifi have correctly perceived the injustice of the University's policies regarding traffic violations, there ought to be a fair number ofstudents who 
feel as helpless and frustrated as I do. 
Martin L. Pippins 
NDnot a finishing school 
Dear Edztor, 
I would like to pose the following questions to the "tuition paying parent" who criticizedAnthony Walton in the Oct. 8 Observer. 
Could it be that Catholic parents are unwilling to take on the responsibility of raising their children to become mature adults? No, I should not gen­eralize. Let me just assert that there are an exceptional few who would prefer to let the institu­tions form the ideals and values of their offspring. 
Perhaps in the good old days, 
parents were correct in assuming 
that the private universities they 
were sending their children to 
were better labeled as glorified 
finishing schools; but somehow I 
rather doubt that. Fortunately, 
whatever the case was then, it is 
certainly not the same now. 
As one of the many students 
currently attending ND who has 
depleted his high school savings 
(money saved in lieu 'of buying a 
car, etc.), worked 70 hour weeks 
GREAT lm5 OF I~ 

during the summmer, juggled a work study job between classes, and who will still be paying off loans years after graduation, I would be very upset if I were to 
~ learn that ND was nothing more than a finishing school. Yes, I and many like me do exist who are 
paying our own tuition. So perhaps you can understand why I became a little annoyed at reading your words: "It is re:lsonable to assume that... the university has obligations not only to you as a student, but to us, the tuition-paying parents." 
I find it sad that there are students who are afraid of "wasting" their parents' money by majoring in what they are interested in. Rather than studying something which will apply to their lives 24 hours a day, they try to please their parents by learning something that will only get them through 40 hours a week. I hope that these students are the exception and not the rule, butI know they exist. It is too bad that there are those few wonderful parents who feel that they can use an other­wise generous act (and some­times even sacrifice) such as paymenCof tuition as a weapon to control the life oV their beloved child. 
Perhaps your words would not have upset me ifthey were not so close to the truth. The admini­stration does cater to the will of the donating alumni and tuition­paying parent before attending to the preference ofthe student. For example: -Due to the drinking problem, students may not have kegs on Green Field; alumni and parents may. -Tuition bills and grades will be sent to the parents, not to the student, even when the studentis paying his own way. -Dining halls will always be a pleasure to eat at on a football Saturday, as food wil be almost edible in anticipation ofsome parents and alumni who might eat there. 
I agree that growing up "takes time, experience, and is best accomplished with some guid­ance." That is why students should be allowed to form their own ideals and values here, instead of having these things dictated to them. At the University one has an abundance of professors, counselors, and theologians to talk to; however, if one must wait until he enters the "real world" before making these decisions, there may notbe the same good, Christian advice around. 

As for your invaluable quote from Ann Landers, I am sorry I missed it, but I do not follow her column. None of my professors have put her on their reading lists. Daniel Bell 
Marquard unfair to imported place kickers 
Dear Editor, 
With resentment, I read Bil Marquard's "Irish Items" colum (Observer. Oct. 8). I will admit tha Harry Oliver is a good placekicker. However, the fact that he is a American has no relevance on th football field. Likewise, Obed Arir' and Vlade J anakiebski have talents that are independent oftheir race o nationality. 
I To make distinctions amon players on the basis of national origin is a tasteless display o prejudice (i.e. ignorance). I would like to advise Mr. Marquard to keep his personal bigotries and fantasies out of his otherwise acceptable column. 
Donald L. Jordan 

Editor's note: I regret that my comments were construed as such. My intent in mentioning Oliver's nationality had nothing to do with slurring those he shared the honor with. It was intended as a commentary on those universities which recruit on an international basis merely for the sake ofa winning athletic team. I was in no way indicting Ohio State or Clemson either: just making an editorial comment on the situation.

Paul Riehle goes in front of the

Riehle, along with Don 
Murday, will also present several 
proposals aimed at improving 
campus social life, and Riehle

Although the referendum 
turnout was only five percent 
more than the requirement (66 
percent had to vote "yes," and a 
whopping 96 percent actually 
did), Riehle was pleased with the 
results, and claimed that if The

time Tuesday, containing the 
popular "Molarity" comic strip 
with a vote promotion as well as 
three separate articles, the turn­out would have been closer to 70 percent. 
At present, only the CLC has the authority to present pro­posals to the University which must be responded to-either positively or negatively-, and Riehle will ask the Student Affairs Committee to transfer that authority to the Student Senate.

Ambiguity dogs Board history 
By Pam Degnan -New.r Edtfor 
In its thirteen year existence, 
Dame Board of 
has been continually 

rceived by the student body as 
the most ambiguous 
policy-maker. Al­
though some attempts have been made to coordinate communica­tion between Board members and student government organ­izations, it is an undeniable fact ·that a majority of the students 
.tre unaware of the exact nature 
.md function ofthis power-wield­
,n~ structure. In addition, the 
B;)ard' s practice of operating 
under closed sessions further contributes to its rather elusive nature. 
In 1967, the University's governmental body, then known as the Associate Board of Trustees, was reorganized into the presentday Board. At the time, the Associate Board, com­posed of six priests, was pri­marily responsible for the financial transactions undertak­en by the University and had no direct bearing on specific University decision making. During a three-year transition period in which the Board moved from a clerical to an over­whelmingly secular body, the University set up new by-laws and statutes that would guide the Board in manv of its decisions. 
Two year; later, student government representatives, frustrated by the ineffectiveness of its governmental structure, confronted the Board with its proposal for a Student Life Council which, they stressed, would break down communica­tion barriers between the students and the Administration. The Board unanimously approv­ed the proposal. The following year, in its spring session, the Board debated and approved the institution of parietals on cam­pus. 

The topic of co-education 
surfaced at Notre Dame in 1971. 
After meeting with the Saint 
Mary's Board of Trustees to 
discuss the possibility ofmerging 
both schools,(in which after 
much detailed research and de­
bate the merger fell through), 
the Notre Dame trustees ap­
proved the idea of co-education 
and earmarked this transition for 
the fall of 1972. 
The social atmosphere at the University was the prime con­cern of the Board in 1973. Hearing· continuous complaints from student leaders concerning the lack of activities on campus and the limited social oppor­tunities, the Board approved the use of alcohol on campus, how­ever, left specifics such as kegs and party rules in the hands of the Administration. Board mem­bers also voted "yes" to a plan that called for an extensive and costly renovation of LaFortune and the Huddle. 
In 197~, the renovation of LaFortune was completed. The Board also passed a plan for the reorganization of the SLC which cut down the size of the council from 24 to 15 members. And, perhaps the most controversial issue that the Board had to face in its short span was to explore the recommendation for a co-ed dorm on campus which was compiled by the Committee on Undergraduate Life. The Board discussed this issue at great length, however, no steps were taken to actively carry out this proposal. The Public Relations and Development Committee was established and it undertook a campus Summa program which had raised nation-wide over $63 million between 1969-1972. The Notre Dame Magazine was created under the auspices ofthis committee as was the birth ofan annual Notre Dame campaign. Prior to this move, donations to

backgrounds. 

The Board meets twice a year­once in October and once in May. There are no attendance requirements, but if a trustee misses several meetings, it would be considered a lack ofinterest in the University, and thatTrustee's chance of re-election would be low, according to James E. Murphy, the associate vice president ofPublic Relationsan,d Development. For example. Murphy said he doubts that Rockefeller would be able to make this meeting because he is up for re-election as governor of West Virginia. However, this would be excusable. 
While the Board of Trustees meets only twice a year, the committees under the Board meet several times a year. These committees are made up of five to 12 trustees. They hold an important function since all business taken up at a Board of Trustees meeting must be brought up through one ofthese committees. 
Ideally, the committees study the subject before the Board meeting, come to a conclusion, and make a recommendation to the Board. 
Since the Board of Trustees is the highest governing body at Notre Dame, no one evaluates them between election years. However, the elections them­selves can serve as an evaluation and may result in the elimination of one of the trustees.

Yes finds rock-n-roll 
After last year's disastrous Notre 
Dame concert, the British classical 
rock quintet Yes had a lot to make up 
for. Speculation was, however, that the 
loss ofaerial vocalistJonAnderson and 
consummate keyboard wizard Rick 
Wakeman would cripple the mega­
talented group irreversibly. How could 
the New Wave replacements, Trevor 
Horn and Geoff Downes, from the 
Buggies, fill the shoes of such rock 
greats? 
After the concert, it was apparent 
that the new additions had no inten­
tion of filling anyone's shoes. Nine of 
the fifteen songs performed were 
either from the new LP Drama, or as yet 
unrecorded material. Obviously, the 
new Yes is precisely that, a new band, 
and they tried to the utmost to 
convince their league of fans that this 
was a better group. For the most part, 
the concert was very convincing-the 
new Yes is different, if not better. 
For openers, new lead vocalist Horn 
at least makes an attempt to relate to 
his audience. Anderson used to simply 
perch himself midstage and perform, 
seemingly oblivious to audience 
response, but Horn likes to introduce 
songs, talk to the band between 
numbers, and simply have a good time., 
His relaxed manner and friendly smile 
gave one the impression that his mind 
was in the arena, not spiraling 
intrepidly across the cosmos. 
Freshman keyboardist Downes scurried from synthesizer to piano to clavinet with the ease and skill of a squirrel collecting nuts for the winter with a countenance focused with concentration. Though he lacks the speed and dexterity of Wakeman, his predecessor, Downes seems more of a true showman. Besides maintaining an attractive physique, which female members of the audience obviously enjoyed, Downes often displayed a freewheeling attitude and encouraged the crowd's cheering responses. Wakeman, like Anderson, simply performed, and his classical training sometimes limited his patience with the audience. Downes, however, is a true rocker who thrives on audience response and participation, and is infinitely more personable. 
This more accessible, relaxed, rock­
n-roller attitude is the new strength of 
Yes. The opening tune, "Does It 
Really Happen?" features a straight 
ahead emphasis on rhythm, which 
drummer Alan White provided amply, 
and on Chris Squire's indomitable 
bass solos, which he ripped off as 
spritely as an automatic rifle. The few 
older pieces performed were of this 
simpler, less orchestrated style, 
namely "Yours Is No Disgrace," and a 
sloppy version of"Roundabout." "Go 
Through This," an as yet unrecorded 
song, seems to be the direction of the 
new Yes: upbeat, conventional rock-n­
roll. 
Unfortunately, this new approach is also the primary weakness of the new Yes. Gone are the complex guitar overlays of virtuoso Steve Howe, who displayed so little ofhis immense talent in a short acoustic solo featuring "The Clap." Though rock-n-roll is a lot of fun, it should be balanced with the older, more symphonic, progressive Yes style. That, apparently, has been discarded. 
It seems that Yes has grown too· sensitive to audience response, giving the masses what they want to hear rather than trying to find new musical avenues to experiment with. Geoff Downes' keyboard solo, entitled "White Car," from the new album, toyed with shifting melodic tones and colors in a difficult and complex manner, while still maintaining some accessibility. The audience's response 
was minimal, at best. Chris Squire's subsequent bass solo, began with "Amazing Grace" (no, I don't. understand it, either) and caromed off into a loud cacophony which can only be labeled as pure BS. The crowd cheered emphatically. Obviously, Yes is drawing a slightly less sophisticated crowd who simply wants to rock. 
The question is, what's wrong with that? Thanks to a rotating stage in the center of the ACC, everyone had a good seat, and the concert was, on the whole, simply a good time. Though most critics (including the idiot for the South Bend Tribune) will have a difficult time adjusting to the new Yes sound, most of the concert-going public will enjoy the change.

Rock Quiz IV Warner Bros. 


(an easy one) 
Last week's quiz must have been very, very tough (or else nobody really cares anymore), because I received no entries at all, correct or otherwise. The answers to last week's stumper appear below this week's quiz. 
This week, I am extending the deadline for correct entries to the Monday after break. That will give you time to look up the answers if you want to cheat. (Ofcourse, I'll have no way of knowing that.) But ifyou already know the answers, why wait? If you're like me, you tend to forget things over break. Bring your answers to the Observer office on the third floor of LaFortune, and-who knows?-you could be the next $10 winner. 
This quiz may be the easiest one I throw at you all year. I am going to name a hit song; all you have to do is identify the album from which it was taken. 
1. "Lady" by Styx 

2. 
"How Can You Mend a Broken Heart" by the Bee Gees 

3. 
"In the Navy" by the Village People 

4. 
"Listen to What the Man Said" by Wings 


5. "Help Me" by Joni Mitchell

Here are the answers to last week's quiz: (1) "Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy" by Elton John was the first album to debut at number one; (2) "Hey Jude" by the Beatles debuted at #3 hut peaked at #2; (3) "Flowers" came out six months after its predecessor, yet contained two songs its predecessor had; (4) "Let It Bleed" was the last Stones' LP to use Brian Jones; (5) "Other Voices" was the first post-Jim Morrison Doors album; (6) "John Denver's Greatest Hits" was the number two album of both 1974 and 1975; (7) "Wonderwall Music" by George Harrison was the first solo Beatie album, from thP. movie "Wonderwall"; (8) "Peter Gabriel" was the name of all three solo releases by Genesis' former lead singer; (9) "No Commercial Potential" was the un­released Mothers of Invt:ntion three­record set; and (10) "Days of Future Passed" by the Moody Blues, with the London Festival Orchestra, was the first rock LP to be recorded entirely in conjunction with an orchestra. 
Tim Neely 
Ignore the fact that it has been five 
years since Paul Simon's last all-new 
album (the Grammy Award winner of 
Album of the Year in 1975, Still Crazy 
After All These Years). Ignore the fact 
that it was three years ago when Simon 
released his last new performances, the 
top-5 hit "Slip Slidin' Away," and 
"Stranded in a Limousine," both of 
which appeared on his Greatest Hits, 
Etc. album. Ignore the fact that Paul 
Simon actually bought the remainder 
ofhis contract from Columbia Records 
so he could solve his contract troubles. 
Even ignore (for now) the fact that his 
new album, One-Trick Pony, is the 
soundtrack from the movie he's been 
working on with the same eye at 
perfection that he has on his albums. 
But do pay attention to the fact that 
Paul Simon has outdone himself again; 
this album is probably his best. 
This album probably could have 
been released a year ago or longer. 
Seven ofthe ten songs have a copyright 
date of 1978, the other three were 
published in 1979. The delay probably 
resulted from a combination of 
Simon's contract difficulties, the 
desire of Simon (and Warner Brothers 
Records, his new label) to wait until the 
movie was finished to release the 
album, and the fact that Paul Simon 
likes his albums to be "perfect" (a Ia 
Steely Dan, Stevie Wonder, and others 
who take years to release new 
material). Working on the..movie at the 
same time as this album didn't help 
speed up the timetable any. 
Since Simon and Garfunkel broke 
up, the "poet" of the group has been 
getting away from the themes of 
alienation and loneliness which 
dominated Simon's writing in the S&G 
days while more or less leaving the 
folk-oriented music of those days 
behind. Instead, Simon has written 
more optimistic, cheery, personal 
songs about relationships and other 
stuff that '60s "folkies" would not have 
considered "important." His music has 
become more diversified as well, 
influenced by music as varied as 
classical, big band, Latin, and reggae. 
As a result, Paul Simon put out three or 
four of the better albums of the 
seventies, each new one-better than 
the last. He continues this progression 
with One Trick Pony. 
Musically, many styles are represented, as usual, and represented well. There is the Latin feel of"Late in the Evening"; the pseudo-disco effect ofparts of"One-Trick Pony" and "Ace in the Hole," the latter of which, as soon as one is hypnotized by the beat, the tempo changes for a few bars to break the monotony, and then goes 
'back to the original beat; the blues (to a degree) in "Oh, Marion"; and jazz ; influence is everywhere. The so-called 
"Dire Straits guitar effect" is heard in 
at least half the tracks, cutting and biting through Simon's tight backup band (for the first time, Simon used essentially the same musicians for each track, and also, two ofthese songs were recorded live with nothing more than his band-no strings or horns). Several of the band members are from jazz backgrounds, thus the strong jazz influence on the album. 

But it is lyrically where Paul Simon continues to shine as brightly as ever. There has to be some reason why he was able to teach a course in songwriting and get away with it, and Simon continues to show us why. He continues to write songs that we can all relate to in one way or another. For now, continuing to ignore the fact that this is a movie soundtrack and judging the songs on their own merits, "That's Why God Made the Movies" is a tale of the need to escape from a real world which isn't too good ("and that's why God made the movies"). "How the Heart Approaches What It Yearns" is the kind of song nearly everyone who has ever fallen in love can relate to (except for the names and a few other changes). Or, how about the lines from 
"Oh, Marion": "The only time/ That love is an easy game/Is when two other people/Are playing it." Almost everyone has felt that way at one time or another. Simon also works with irony in the song "Nobody." It seems to be a song of unhappiness-"Who took my two hands and made them four/Who is my heart, who is my door/Nobody"-but then he adds, " ... nobody but you, girl," and it becomes a song ofexactly the opposite sentiment. Yet the fact remains that this album is intended to be a movie soundtrack and must also be judged as such. 
When most rock-related artists do movie sound tracks, the songs turn out to be either gloppy and watered-down (e.g., Electric Light Orchestra's songs in Xanadu, Neil Diamond's in jonathan Livingston Seagull) or totally irrelevant 
(e.g. almost all ofElvis Presley's movie songs, the Beatles' songs in He/pl). However, One-Trick Pony didn't turn out that way. In fact, if this wasn't a movie soundtrack, it could just as easily be a rock opera. One can get a good idea what the movie is about by listening to the songs and reading the lyrics (as usual, included with the album). Try to do that with Saturday Night Fever or Grease (the movie soundtrack has the songs hopelessly out of order), for example. The songs on One Trick Pony seem to be in order, from the introduction ("Late in the Evening") to the finale ("Long, Long Day"). 
Ifthere is a weak point in this album, it is the fact that the songs are neither written nor sung from Paul Simon's own point of view. They are supposed to reflect the point of view of the character he plays in the movie. Therefore, the songs are not as personal as his prior solo songs. For example, "Late in the Evening" is not an autobiography of Paul Simon, it is an autobio[ 1phy of the character he plays. There is really no way to know that just by listening to the song on the radio by itself. The only exception to this might be "Ace in the Hole"; that song stands on its own well and could well be the oext single from the album. 
Musically, the year 1980 has been a bad year for the established artists. Many of them have put out material inferior to the music which made them superstars in the first place (e.g_ Billy Joel, Bob Seger, Paul McCartney). So don't let the AM hit "Late in the Evening" (which, even I will admit, is probably the most blatantly com­mercial song, musically, that Simon has ever released) turn you off from One-Trick Pony; the rest of the album makes up for it easily.

Gourmet Oub plans 
season 
Two complaints voiced throughout the Notre Dame student body involve the in­adequacies ofthe dining halls and 
the social environment. In an attempt to remedy a portion of this problem, some students have become inteested in organ­izing a Gourmet Club. Last semester, the group was formed on a limited experimental basis and received a very positive response from its roughly 60 charter members. 
The structure of the Gourmet Club centers on distinct dinner groups of six to eight men or women, each of which is coordinated by a head chef for that group. The main functions of the head chefare to assemble six to eight interested friends, to communicate with head chefs of other dinner groups, and to be responsible for organizing the host meals of his or her re­spective group. 
In the past, imaginative meals have included French dinners by candlelight, champagne brunch­es, and various ethnic meals. 
Tentatively, the Gourmet Club intends to begin its cooking season the first weekend after break. Anyone interested in getting together a dinner group should attend the brief organi­zational meeting at 6:30 p.m. tonight, in LaFortune's Little Theater. 
When the number ofindividu­al groups has been specifically determined, a dinner schedule will be distributed to each ofthe Head Chefs. : 
Anyone wno would like to meetnew people around a home­cooked meal is welcome. If you have any questions or cannot attend the meeting, contact Kathy Welsh, 135 Breen-Phillips Hall, #1267.

Had Notre Dame won that game, the Irish would have clinched a first-round bye in the state tourney next month. The loss moved the overall Irish record to 8-5 for the year. 
The Irish take on Marion tomorrow on Cartier Field, in their last home game of the season. 
"Marion will be another big challenge," said Galen, "but we've had the time this week for three strong practices, so we're looking at a good, even game." 
Notre Dame plays the last six regular-season games on the road, including a match against St. Louis, who is currently ranked seventh in the nation.

The Irish Rugby Club has reached the midpoint of its fall season, and carries a 2-2 record East with it over October break. Notre Dame will face the Long Island Rugby Club and Boston College next week in an attempt to improve on an already en­c0uraging season. 
The club was airled a gr~at deal in recent weeks by an honest-to­God Irishman. The coach of a club in Ireland took time out to work with the Notre Dame club, and Coach Rich Harper has noticed great improvement since the unexpected help. 
"We have improved tre­mendouslv thanks to his help, and I look for even more pro­gress through the remaining games," says Harper. 
The Irish "A" team dropped a 
16-6 decision to Marquette last 
weekend, while the "B" and "C" 
squads tied 0-0 in their respective 
games which were called due to 
darkness. Dan Pearl and Brian 
MacManus handled the scoring 
chores for the "A" team in the 
game played following the Notre 
Dame-Miami football game. 
Harper noted the effect of playing after the football contest as opposed to before the game, as is the usual custom. "A lot of guys were just worn out after the football game, and we had a tough time getting up for our game. But I don't want to take

The Sail~ng Club finished third overall last weekend at the M1am1 Co-ed Regatta. Jerry Daus finished fourth in the men's division for the Irish in the seven-man field, while Mimi Torterilli raced to second place in the women's division. Jane Brown, Carol Silva, Marquerita Cintra and Jean Heaaly will race in an all-woman regatta at Ohio Wesleyan this weekend. 
Season hockey ticketSmaybepickedup at the second floor ticket window in the ACC between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. either today or tomorrow. Students who have notyet purchased season tickets may wish to do so at these times. 
Th~ novice ~oxing finalswmbeheld tomght m the ACC boxmg room beginning at 8 p.m. These novice boxers, who are preparing for this spring's Bengal Bout competition, advanced to tonight's finals with first-round victories on Monday night There are nine bouts scheduled for tonight in as many weight classes. A small admission fee will be charged and forwarded to to the Holy Cross missions in Bengladesh. 
The pep rally for the Notre Dame-Army football game has been canceled, Jim Magers, chairman of the pep rally committee, announced yesterday. The beginning of October break was cited as the reason for the decision. 
(continued from page 16) 
In the backcourt, senior Tracy Jackson and sophomore John Paxson will be faced with the task of replacing Bill Hanzlik and Rich Branning, the only losses from last year's starting five. Paxson will be the quarterback, the guard that runs the offense-which does not mean, however, his role will be limited just to watching Digger and shouting little numbers that I've never been able to understand. Paxson can shoot and, in fact, will have to shoot, if there is to be any balance in the Irish backcourt 
Because we all know Tracy Jackson can shoot­and will shoot-and will have to shoot, because no team wins ballgames if it doesn't score points. Senior Stan Wilcox will contribute as will sophomore Mike Mitchell-if, that is, the orthoscopic examination Mitchell will undergo today on his left knee does not indicate damage that -would sideline the sharpshooter for any length of time. 
Two other freshmen, Tom Sluby and Barry Spencer, will be listed as swingmen-a fancy term which means they can play forward or guard. Walk-ons Kevin Hawkins and Marc Kelly will be available to provide depth in practice. 
Ok, how about a key to the season? 
How about Kelly Tripucka? 
A clever sportswriter (No, it wasn't Craig Chval) once told me that the difference between a good team and a great team is "the cream." 
"For a good team to win a championship," he advised me, "the cream has to rise to the top. Just like a pitcher of sweet milk." 
A quick comparison between Tripucka's statistics and Notre Dame's performance gives good indication that the addage: "As Tripucka goes, so goes the Irish," may have some credence in 1980-81. 
Last season, Tripucka averaged 21.8 points over the last 14 games in which he played. The Irish won 11 of them, losing only to North Carolina State, 
  . Tripticka 
MarquettS! and Missouri. Because of an injury, he missed four games-Maryland, LaSalle, Davidson and Navy. The team struggled with the Terripins, lost to the Explorers and slept through the last two just like the fans (the ones, that is, that bothered to show up). 
In those 14 games, Tripucka shot 61 percent from the field. He scored 29 points against South Carolina and, in what was probably one of the finest performances ever by a Notre Dame player, he tallied 28 against undefeated DePaul in a game the Irish won in double overtime. Tripucka should have won the most valuable player award in that game, however the Chicago-area media people couldn't see past Mark Aguirre and they voted in a bloc that insured the DePaul sophomore's victory. Nevertheless, it seems safe to say that when Tripucka is on Notre Dame has almost unlimited potential. 
However, Tripucka, in spite of the evidence, maintains that only a team effort will give the Irish the national cage championship that has eluded them so many times in recent years. 
"We have to play good, solid team defense and dominate the boards," he says. "We have to have a positive attitude of confidence and belief in ourselves and one another as a team. That's the only way we can win a national championship." 
And Tripucka is quick to point out that winning a national championship is the goal ofevery player on the team. 
"A lot of luck is involved and we have to be prepared to deal with whatever circumstances come up," he explains. "Injuries, momentum, a tough schedule... Looking at the whole thing realistically you can see that it won't be easy. 
"But we're ready. If we don't do it this year it ;nay be a while before Notre Dame has the experience and talent to challenge again. The seniors-Tracy, Gilbert, Orlando, Stan and I­
know this is our last year.
