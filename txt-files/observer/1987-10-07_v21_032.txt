Students must focus on intellectual life 
In the past few days of our newspaper's publication, two of our editors have made an effort to address some aspect of education at the University and some of the reasons behind its areas of weakness. Common Sense also ad­dressed some aspects of this issue. Everyone had his own opinion; all had some measure of validity. 
The fundamental point that each of those who addressed this issue expressed had much to do with the lack of intelligent debate in this com­munity on pertinent issues. 
One claimed that this newspaper was at fault for not stirring the pot a bit; another claimed that the chasm between the colleges represented diverse areas of thought that are often destructive to the University's definition of itself; the last claimed that the shrill clamor­ings of those with differing opinions stifle legitimate debate. 
I do not believe all those that commented hit the nail on the head. However, what they each have pointed to are symptoms of a greater prob­lem that we have here on campus. 

Last year the Intellectual Life Committee, under the auspices of student government, pre­sented the University's Board of Trustees with a review of and recommendations on the intel­lectual life of the undergraduate student body.

Falwell, IRS talk on ministries' finances 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The Inter­nal Revenue Service said Tues­day it lacks authority to prop­erly police the tax-exempt status of churches, and the Rev. Jerry Falwell said the PTL sex scandal has caused such public concern that tele­vision ministers will be forced into policing themselves. 
"The arrogance we have all been guilty of in the past is over," Falwell told a congres­sional hearing that was called in the wake of the sex-and­payoff scandal in the PTL min­istry. "We are all naked before the public now and those (ministers) who deserve to sur­vive, will," he added. 
The Lynchburg, Va., evan­gelist, who presides over a $100 million-a-year ministry built around the "Old Time Gospel Hour" and temporarily heads the PTL as well, said a new code of ethics being developed by National Religious Broadcasters will help assure contributors that their money is not being squandered. 
the IRS simply has no way of knowing if some ministeries 
are cheating. 
"Under current law the ser­vice is limited by the informa­tior~ it presently receives from churches and the restrictions on our ability to audit churches," Gibbs said. "The service, therefore, is unable to assure the same level of com­pliance with the tax laws by these organizations as is the case with other tax-exempt or­ganizations." 
Asked what laws he would like changed, Gibbs declined to say. "I want to hear the other side of the story first," he said. 
Gibbs heard from the Rev. Oral Roberts of Tulsa, Okla., who caused raised eyebrows earlier this year by saying he would die unless he raised $8 million: "Organizations, whe­ther religious or secular, which raise contributions from the public must be accountable. Some changes in the law to en­sure this accountability as well as uniform enforcement may be needed." 
"People vote with their .---­
checkbooks," Falwell said. Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas 
called the hearing before his
House Ways and Means over­sight subcommittee to find out whether there is widespread abuse of the tax-exempt status of churches and religious or­ganizations, especially those heavily involved in television. The one-day session was

Faculty battles parking lot 'pits' 
A few weeks ago, Campus Security mailed new parking stickers to the fac­ulty. Many faculty, including many who prefer to park somewhere else, received stickers for the B-1 Lot, lo­cated on Dorr Road near the Stadium. OK, one learns to make do. B-1 is a big lot, so somebody with a B-1 sticker should have a fighting chance to find a parking slot there. 
Bob Kerby 
guest column 

B-1's only fault is its proximity to the Stadium. Once upon a time, four or five years ago, somebody exiled to B-1 had to figure that the lot would be unusable ten days a year, the five Fridays before home football games and five Satur­days during which Jerry Faust pursued a national championship. People with B-1 stickers understood why the lot was reserved on home football Saturdays: expensive parking for important fans in the shadow of the Stadium doubtless pays a lot of faculty salaries. It was tougher to understand why the lot was also closed on Fridays, until Security's parking discipline taught teachers to eschew the distraction of scholarship during the University's periodic_ celebration of the sacrament of foot­ball. 
About three years ago, things started to get worse. Security started to rope off sections of B-1 on Thursdays, some­times trapping faculty cars in the lot. Apparently, the lot was needed by the folks who erect lights and by a couple of TV vans, even though these alien in­truders did not, in fact, occupy much space. Again, the faculty adapted. Having rescued our cars, we quit reading books in our offices on Thursdays. 
Things then got worser and worser. Last year, huge swaths of B-1 were commonly wired closed on the Wednes­days before home games, often trap­ping even more faculty automobiles. In addition, one of the entrances to the unblockaded portion of the lot was par­tially obstructed by two huge garbage dumpsters; secondary entrances to the unblockaded segment of B-1 were also sawhorsed closed at whimsical ran­dom; and somebody made a point of spreading lots of fractured glass shards--doubtless from non-alcoholic 
Doonesbury 
.~ 
beverage containers--all over B-1 every football weekend, making it a challenge to use even on the rare days when faculty members could figure out a way to park there. 
This year, it's the pits. The dumpsters are still in place, partially blocking the main entrance to half of the lot. Another entrance to that half of the lot was wired shut two weeks before the first home football game, for no rea­son that I can fathom. And on the Mon­day preceding that game--that is, five full class days plus the Saturday hours before the first domestic football rap­ture of the season--the other half of B-1 was not only roped off, but guarded by uniformed and armed minions of Campus Security. I'm sure we can also look forward to mountains of non­alcoholic bottle glass next week, too. 
And it's going to get worse too. Rumor has it that the Malloy Class­room Building will be built square on B-1, one of these years, making parking an even more exciting adventure. 
One must admit that some victims of the Campus Cops' mysterious parking scheme are not excessively troubled. Realists who specialize in those disci­plines which expect little improvement in the human condition, such as economists and historians and Cal­vinist theologians and people who ac­tually read Hemingway or Graham Greene, learn to accept fate and cope. We come to work befor the sun comes up, to grab the few parking spaces that exist and outmaneuver everybody else. But the impact of Security's parking arrangements upon our Utopian col­leagues is bloody lamentable. There is nothing sadder than the sight of philosophers and poets ramming there Volvos and Yugos together in mur­derous combat for parking spaces. 
In the spirit of constructive criticism, let me offer a solution. As soon as the University constructs a new glass-and­chrome pentagon for the ROTCs, why not convert the old "temporary" ROTC building into a faculty barracks, thus obviating the need for the faculty to drive to work? Contracts then could obligate faculty to prove their dedica­tion by living on campus through every football season. Full professors might, of course, be allowed to visit their families on weekends, and the Campus Cops might issue occasional special paroles to lesser academicians who publish multivolume studies full of big

thoughts or who help to keep the faculty barracks tidy. This solution will not seriously ease the punishment faculty must endure to teach here, because football ends before the snows come. The faculty will, therefore, be able to move back into town just in time to become (along with sundry University secretaries and minions) the only people in Northern Indiana who must brave the blizzards and drive to work when snow shuts down both the State and the University's unplowed parking lots.

Misery of depression can be helped 
I didn't know where I'd ever find hap­piness again. I knew I wouldn't find it in myself and I especially knew I wouldn't find it at school. I just couldn't handle the stress. But you know, every one of the students on this campus is under a lot of stress -stress to perform academically, stress to socialize, stress from all directions. Some can handle the pressure, but the plain truth is that many of us can't. As for me, I thought I could get out of the depression myself. I didn't need "professional help." Hey, I h~d made it this far without it, why now? 
The thing that I didn't know and I'm sure many others don't know is that our body chemistry can do funny things to us when not carefully monitored. I would never have suspected a chemical imbalance causing my deep denim­blue mood. If it were not for the McBrides, a family who cared enough about me to bring me to see the doctor, I would still be wallowing in my pool of self-misery. Oh, and I can't forget about the tremendous support I got from my own family. Without this core of people showing me the love and af­fection I deserve I would still be hating myself. Or who knows, maybe I just wouldn't be ... 
If there's one thing I want the readers to get out of this article it's that help is available and not to be ashamed to ask for it. It's too bad that mental in­stitutions have gotten a bad rap from nicknames such as "crazy house" and "funny farm" because I can say now without hesitation and with the utmost confidence that my three weeks at Kingwood were the most valuable three weeks of my life. Gigi Junkins is a junior Psychology major. 
Quote of the Day 
"Any fool can count the seeds 
In  an  apple. Only  God  can  
count  all  the  apples  In  one  
seed.''  

Oh, what a beautiful season autumn is. With the coming of the most beau­tiful time of the year comes the start of school. That means time to go clothes shopping, go to football games and time to see old friends once again after the long (or should I say "too short" sum­mer?). Always accompanying the reunion of friends is the inevitable ques­tion-"How was your summer?" Most of you were probably eager to share a story or two about that disgusting fast­food restaurant job or an exhilarating experience with a big-name company internship, but somehow l can't relate to either of these described summer follies. I'm not sure I even like hearing that dreaded question about my sum­mer experiences. 
Gigi Junkins 
guest column 
No, I didn't have a temporary sum­mer job, nor did I enjoy myself on the sand of some far-out beach. I can't even decide if I even had fun. But there's one thing I can say. I learned a helluva lot. I learned a lot about myself, my attitude towards people and I learned especially about the strength and loyalty of my family and the impor­tance of God. Where did I learn all of this? In my three weeks' stay at Kingwood Psychiatric Hospital. I can write about it now because' the hell is over, but in the beginning I didn't know if I wanted to live or not. 
Depression is an awful mental dis­position to have to endure. It was de­pression that made me reject my friends, my family, my values, all my past accomplishments, and worst of all, made me strongly question my future.

ND graduate returns as 'Salesman' lead 

BETH HEALY · accent writer 
f 
ather Arthur Harvey leaned back In an armchair In a conservative drawing room of Corby Hall. "Thirty years ago In 1957, almost to this very day, I directed 'Death of a Salesman' on the stage of Washington Theatre. I had an extraordinary cast then and I'm working with an extraordinarily gifted cast now." 
This will be Harvey's third time to direct the play "Death of a Salesman," and It will be the second time he directs ac­tor Daniel Dally In the lead role of Willy Loman. Ten years ago, Dally played the part when he was a senior speech and drama m~or at Notre Dame. Now, as a professional actor currently living In New York, Dally Is re­turning to both Washington Hall and Harvey as a guest art­Ist. 
The play centers around a man named Willy Loman, played by Dally. Playwright Ar­thur Miller examines the conse­quences of a country that Is obsessed with success and the toll It takes on a little man. Dally describes Willy Loman as being a man who "did not live his life based on his own tal­ents because he was obsessed with being number one." 
Miller presents him as the epitome of unrealized poten­tial. "Willy Is actually much more talented as a carpenter than a salesman, but he could never see a carpenter being a success," said Dally. 
"Just as a general note, many people are more worried about choosing a life that Is

practical than one that will

the best time to figure out 
what you'll be happy doing. 
Unfortunately, for some It 
closes doors rather than opens 
them," commented Dally. 
Ten years of experience In 
the cruel world of acting -­
where the unemployment rate 
fluctuates somewhere between 
85 and 90 percent --has rein­
forced Dally's basic objective of 
just making a living doing what 
he el'\loys doing. Those years 
have added to Dally's Interpre­
tation of Willy Loman's charac­
ter. 
"A little bit of him exists In 
all of us. If you live In America, 
there Is a mlndset that says the 
only way to come out Is num­
ber one. You can see the 
downside of that competitive­
ness In Willy's personality, "said 
Dally. 
After mistakes and disap­
pointments on the road, It's 
easier now for Dally to relate to 
Willy's confused state of mind 
and why he makes the mis­
takes he does. His years of 
experience as an actor and a 
• person contribute to the en­hl:mcement of the role. Com­mented Harvey, "Here's an ac­tor who, 1 0 years ago, was a student actor. Because of his experience, he has grown In stature. Now I have a more experienced and mature talent to work with." 
Like Dally, Harvey also feels that there Is a little bit of Willy Loman In all of us and that the play Is truly "a modem classic." "It Is a play with universal ap­plications. I like the actors to realize this with their own tal­ent. so I don't Impose anything on them. In rehearsals, as we move Into the Interpretive stage, I have to realize that everyone Is unique." 
After directing plays for over 50 years, and some .30-odd productions In the Notre Dame Theatre, Harvey said that he's delighted to be directing "Death (){,~ Salesman" again. "Ahy classic is not open to just one lnterpretalon. I always try' to have a fresh approach," he said. 
Dally commented that he hasn't felt a big l:l;J~ge In the students at Notre Dame since 1977. "The students who are In this cast are every bit as talented, and as Imaginative and fun-loving as the group that I worked with 10 years ago." 
Similarly, Harvey expressed a congruent feeling about the students at Notre Dame. "There Is a lot of talk about the stu­dents being different. I've been here for .37 years, and essen­tially, deep down I've always found an extraordinary talent here," he said. 
This reunion performance of "Death of a Salesman" should prove to be as special for Dally and Harvey as for current stu­dents and visiting alumni at­tending the show. "Each time I see It I am moved by It," said Harvey. " It has stood the test of time, and that's why It can be considered an American classic." 
The show starts tonight at 
8:10 In Washington Hall and will run until Saturday. A Sun­day matinee begins at .3: 10

One courtesy that seems to be dropping by the wayside among the younger generation Is the RSVP." I stress that an RSVP means to respond to an Invitation within a week after It Is received, preferably sooner," she said. 
"We are also finding that more people are beginning to send thank-you notes," Cooper noted. "Thanking people for gifts Is an absolute require­ment. That's another way of standing out. of giving yourself the edge."

Former Irish players become substitutes in NFL 
By PETE GEGEN Assistant Sports Editor 
Thanks to the NFL strike, ten former Irish football players have joined teams as replace­ments. 
The Indianapolis Colts lead the way with three Irish players on their roster -Pat Ballage, Ron Plantz and Shawn Heffern. 
Chris Smith is getting his chance with the Kansas City Chiefs at fullback. Against the Los Angeles Raiders, Smith carried the ball eight times for 39 yards. 
John Carney joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but he didn't suit up for the game against Detroit. Van Tiffin, an Alabama alumnus, beat Car­
ney  out  for  the placekicking  
job.  
Troy  Wilson  (Cleveland  

Browns), Joe Howard (Buffalo), Ron Weissenhofer <New Orleans Saints) and Mike Perrino (Philadelphia) add to the list of former Irish players. 
The final Notre Dame alumnus playing during the strike is Rick DiBernardo. The former Irish outside linebacker is playing for the Los Angeles Rams, the team which had cut him in the preseason. 
"I only had two weeks in camp before I was released," says DiBernardo from the Rams' offices in Los Angeles. "That's not a lot of time to eval­uate a player. With the strike, now's the time to evaluate me." 
Crossing the picket lines has not been a problem for the Rams' replacements. Most players stay at a Quality Inn nearby, although DiBernardo lives at his home in Garden Grove, Calif. A van takes the players from the hotel to the practices. 

With one year of NFL expe­rience with the St. Louis Car­dinals under his belt, DiBer­nardo says would like to return to the NFL for two reasons ­his love of the game and his pension. 
"I would like the strike to cover three games," says DiBernardo. "That will give (Rams coach Ray) Robinson time to look us over, plus it will give me two years vested." 
Under the 1982 bargaining agreement, players receive one year vested for at least three games played in a season. After acquiring two years, a player is eligible for half his pension. Four years (or three years and three games) vested gives a player his full pension. 
DiBernardo's versatility should help his chances of making the Rams' roster once the strike is over. With the rosters expected to expand by at least four players per team, DiBernardo can play both in­side and outside linebacker, as well as long snapper and even tight end.

tured and developed last fall and now appear ready to lead the Irish to their first NCAA bid. Bennett's flashy play and powerful kills have Notre Dame fans flashing Z-cards after each kill. Waller finished the 1986 campaign fifth in the nation in hitting percentage, and Shea has been a model of consistency.

"What does it take?" asked Notre Dame fans after the snubbing. "A stronger schedule" countered the Irish. With a beefed-up schedule in­cluding several nationally­ranked powers, Notre Dame's first NCAA bid may be a few big wins away. 
One big win could be this Friday night. The Irish will host Kentucky, ranked tenth in the latest NCAA poll. With a week off to prepare and a quest in mind, an upset may just be in the making. Not that I'm making a plug or anything, but it sure would help if there were a big crowd on hand ­
Tuesday afternoon brought good news to the Irish that anonymnity may be a thing of the past. While still absent from the NCAA polls, Notre Dame was among four teams "also recieving votes" in the Tachikara!AVCA (Coaches' Poll) rankings. 
It's not the Top Twenty, but it's a start. For this week we'll call it the Top Twenty-Four. With the talent on Lambert's team and the opportunity knocking on the door in the form of the Kentucky Wildcats, we may only need to call it that for a week. Then we'll drop the '-Four.'

Cards top Giants 
Associated Press 
ST. LOUIS -Emergency starter Greg Mathews blew away pressure and the Giants, pitching four-hit ball for 7 1-3 innings and blooping a key two­run single Tuesday night as the St. Louis Cardinals beat San Francisco 5-3 in the first game of the National League playoffs. 
The Cardinals, plagued by in­juries all season and playing without ailing first baseman Jack Clark, were not hurt this time after scheduled starter Danny Cox came down with a stiff neck. Mathews, told four hours before the game he would pitch, responded coolly against the team that pounded him three times this year. 
Mathews gave up three runs, two earned. He tied a season­high with seven strikeouts and walked one. Mathews, who drove in only three runs this year, also contributed a single that capped a three-run sixth for a 5-2 lead.

Todd Worrell relieved after Mathews' first walk in 22 in­nings, to Robby Thompson with one out in the eighth. Worrell, with a 7.36 earned run average in six games against the Giants this year, gave up a single to Jeffrey Leonard, an RBI double to Candy Maldonado and a walk to Chili Davis that loaded the bases. 
Ken Dayley, a left-bander, quelled the threat by getting the left-handed Clark on a fly ball to right fielder Curt Ford just short of the warning track. 
Mathews, a second-year left­bander, and 38-year-old Rick Reuschel were settled into a 2-2 game when a blown rundown triggered the Cardinals' three­run sixth. 
Dan Driessen doubled with one out and was then trapped when shortstop Jose Uribe grabbed Willie McGee's infield hit in the hole. But Uribe bounced a throw to second baseman Thompson for an er­ror that allowed Driessen to reach third.

Irish volleyball: Home sweet home 
There's no place like home. 
Dorothy said it, and the Notre Dame volleyball team is thinking it after over a month of road games. 
En route to a 14-3 record, the Irish have played only three home matches so far this season. In all three, however, Notre Dame has swept its oppo­nents in three straight games and given up a max­imum of 10 points in a single game. 
In fact, the Irish have lost only two matches in the Joyce ACC in two years, both in early September of last season. Talk about home court advantage. Notre Dame now has a 14-match winning streak in the friendly confines of the Joyce ACC. 
With the exception of an October break trip south, the Irish will play 11 of their remaining 13 matches under the roof of the JACC. Home sweet home. 
Two years ago, the Irish were looking to avoid streaks, because a streak probably meant a losing streak. Notre Dame was 12-19 that season, and played its games in the ACC Arena. 
Last fall, the Irish moved the games to the Aux­iliary Gym, affectionately known as The Pit, while the Arena floor was undergoing renovation. The move was no inconvenience for the Irish. 
Now a crowd of 400, which barely fills two sections of those soft-cushioned seats that we sit in only for a campus-wide Mass, makes the The Pit a nemesis for Notre Dame opponents. The crowd is close to the action and the noise level is now at least dis­cernible, if not distracting to the visitors. Further­more, the Irish have become used to every nook and cranny of the gymnasium, such as reacting to an occasional ball deflected off the ceiling and the 
proximity of the portable bleachers. 
Brian O'Gara 
Irish Items 


Since that move last fall, the Notre Darrie volley­ball team has a record of 15-2 at home. 
But if we're dishing out credit for the recent suc­cess of the Irish, let's move upstairs from The Pit to a small office on the second floor of the JACC, behind the football national championship trophy cases (which look like they may have room for another ... ). The name outside the door reads 'Art Lambert, Volleyball Head Coach.' What it means to say is 'The Art of Volleyball.' 
Lambert, now in his fourth year at the helm for the Irish, has a career record of 95-52-1. He should reach the century-win mark later this month. While personal accomplishments are not important to this man, he sure has enough of them -most notably as the head coach for Stanford, the 1976 NCAA water polo champions, and the U.S. water polo team in the 1967 Pan American Games (winning the gold) and 1972 Olympics (bronze medal). 
Lambert is the first to point out that the turn­around of the eight-year-old Irish volleyball pro­gram, 53-80 before him and 73-44 since, is the result of the hard work of his players. 
Hard work is something Lambert demands, es­pecially when he sees something wrong. Last season, after an impressively-easy win, he had the team out practicing serves after he saw too many service errors in the match. The win didn't matter consistent play did. 
Lambert's first recruiting class, presently juniors, form the core of this squad. Zanette Ben­nett, Mary Kay Waller and Maureen Shea earned starting spot~ as freshmen on that 12-19 squad, rna­

Political realities blur idea of good 

An article in last Tuesday's View­point would have us think the world would be a better place if we could just get rid of bad guys. Glenn Fogarty's position is that communists are bad guys and they are ruining Nicaragua. His position is well supported by exam­ples from that country seen with the logic and moral sense of T.V. culture; clear and simple. The end always comes out right when the good guys prevail. We, of course, are good guys, and as such can easily discern who the other good guys are in this world. Our mission is to back the good guys and to seek out and destroy the enemy. The plot unfolds like an episode of Mac­Gyver. 
David Carrier 
guest column 

I don't disagree with this freshman's analysis. Let's try out his framework on some other guys I've been reading about in last week's Washington Post. Decide whether they're good or bad. 
A group of Lebanese militiamen receive money and training from the 
U.S. in order to become a more effec­tive hit squad. In one of their opera­tions, they plant a car bomb intended to kill Sheikh Mohammed Fadlalla, leader of Shiite Moslems in Lebanon. Instead, it kills about 60 civilians and injures many others. 
Bashir Gemayel, a proven killer and leader of the most powerful Christian militia in Lebanon, asks for $10 million in covert paramilitary support to carry out unknown operations in Beirut. He gets it, with clear approval of President Reagan in the form of a "finding." Soon after his death, his followers enter two Palestinian refugee camps protected by U.N. charter and kill over 700 people, many of whom were women and children. 
Widely condemned leaders such as Ferdinand Marcos are provided with hundreds of thousands of dollars in mil­itary aid-without strings-often used simply to pay off the people that keep them in power. Other funds are pro­vided to organizations and individuals that spread propaganda seen as favor­able to our interests. The recipients in­clude the Prime Minister of Dominica, who happened to be one of the Car­ribean leaders requesting U.S. inter­vention in Grenada. And despite Pope John Paul's admonition to the churches to not get politically involved, the Arch­bishop of Nicaragua accepted C.I.A. money to keep his anti-Sandinista radio station on the air. (Is there any wonder why the government felt it had to shut them down?) 
A country condemned by nearly the entire world for waging an unprovoked war against its neighbor and refusing to negotiate peace financed that war primarily through oil exports to the

its war effort. In the meantime the U.S. 
was lying to the rest of the world about 
its covert support of Iran, thereby 
gaining a monopoly in trade of both 
arms and oil that worked to their 
mutual advantage and the profitability 
of some shady arms dealers. 
The greatest democratic country in the world is dominated by a small group of men who deceive the elected repre­sentatives of its people, and thereby cir­cumvent the accountability required of any democratic system. S~ddled with a military operation that went beyond its means, the C.I.A. tried to persuade Defense Secretary Weinberger and Secretary of State Schultz to have their respective departments take over the operation. These ·men, believing that operations of the magnitude C.I.A. director Casey was talking about could only be carried out with the knowledge and consent of the people, refused. They knew the public would not support a ragtag bunch of reactionaries with weak democratic principles and public leadership skills, and who showed lack of good judgement and a penchant for abuses of human rights. A public U.S. role in another "dirty little war" against primarily innocent non­combatants would appear to the rest of the world like another Afghanistan; a bully super-power picking on a small, poor, and defenseless nation. Director Casey was not discouraged. Congres­sional oversight was avoided by managing the operations in the White House basement: The funds did not go through C.I.A. accounts, and in Casey's words, an "off the shelf, self sustaining, stand-alone capability" to conduct covert operations was born. 
I could go on, but you'd have to be dumber than Rambo to have not gotten the message. In the real world, it's just not like T.V., no matter how hard we try to make it out to be that way. In the game of us versus them,everyone plays hardball, not just the commu­nists. And interestingly enough, if you try for a minute to get beyond your own naivte and not be ideologically commit­ted, in the plot of this show everyone comes out looking like a bad guy. and it's mostly innocent people who suffer the greatest -the Lebanese child, the twelve-year-old Iranian soldier, the old woman who happened to be in the Nicaraguan coffee field the day of the ambush. And last and perhaps least, the American public, who incremen­tally and unknowingly are losing their democratic process. So how do you get rid of the bad guys now? Who would do it? Americans insist on plots with some kind of resolution. How will this story end? 
You and I will probably not be stopped f:om hoping for a good guy, deluding ourselves into believing one exists, or believing someone else's propaganda about the good and the bad guys. We will probably not even be stopped from the ultimate arrogance of presumingwe are the good guys. It's all part of T.V. culture, and you and I are its adherents and disciplines. The real truth could only be that "there is one good, and that is God," which leaves us with only two options. You could pray for all sinners, and of course in­clude yourself, if you choose to believe in God. If you don't, then please, for my sake and that of all the innocent people in the world, stay out of trouble. 




Many aspects to Soviet research 
Dear Editor: 

I found Mr Robert Tomihiro's view­
point of September 17, about the state 
of the American space program, inter­
esting, to say the least. Although I 
agree with Mr. Tomihiro that a space 
platform is a good idea, there are 
numerous flaws in Mr. Tomihiro's 
argument. 

The most evident shortcoming is Mr. Tomihiro's ignorance of the Soviet space program. He characterizes So­viet rockets as "outmoded". While it is true that the basic rocket has not changed since Gagarin's day, this rocket did launch the Soviet space sta­tion Salyut 4 into a 220 mile orbit. The space shuttle orbits at 240 miles. Al­though they may be old, Soviet rockets are certainly not outmoded. 
Mr. Tomihiro further characterizes the Soviet program as intended solely for "killer satellites". While it is true that the military plays a major role in the Soviet program, let us not forget that the Air Force saved our own shuttle from being scrapped, let us not forget the military's role in two top se­cret shuttle flights. But in spite of the strong military presence, the Soviet program has forged ahead in basic space research, such as production of interferon, vaccines, and antibiotics-­to say nothing of research on the effects of eight or more months in space on humans. 
The Soviets are also pioneers in in­dustrial research. Cosmonauts on the Salyut 7 mission from March 13 to December 10, 1982, produced a silver­geranium alloy, and more importantly, grew micro-crystals essential for semi­conductors. In addition, cosmonauts lo­cated several sources of mineral wealth, and assisted construction en­gineers in Siberia. They successfully di­rected fishing boats to large schools of fish, saving the Soviet fleet an esti­mated 20 million roubles. 
The Soviets are leaders in the field of space technology, perfecting the techniques of robot docking, allowing one crew on a space station to be sup­plied indefinitely. But the best example of this technology occurred on June 25, 1984, when Soviet Cosmonaut Sevetla Savitskana, operating outside Salyut 7, cut, welded, and soldered a piece of titanium, with one tool in zero gravity.

I mean don't go out and join the C.I.A. or anything like that. Naive ideologues in powerful places are very dangerous people. Just go back to watching your T.V., O.K.? . 
David Carrier is a graduate student in economics. 
These techniques would be essential for any construction in outer space. 
It is clear than that the Soviet pro­gram is more than just a "killer satel­lite" deployment system. And just as rational basic research has been the hallmark of the Soviet program, it should also be the guiding vision of the American. A space platform or station should be built for basic research, not for right-wing xenophobic reasons.

Candidates should be scrutinized 
Dear Editor: 
In the Viewpoint column of Septem­ber 30th, Lisa Boykin lamented the recent loss of two Democratic presiden­tial hopefuls due to the intense public scrutiny focused on their extra-political activities. To show the foolishness of this scrutiny of otherwise well­qualified candidates, she pointed out the love affair which visionary Thomas Jefferson held with a slave mistress. In her conclusion, she expressed concern that this examination of the moral lives of candidates would overshadow the ex­amination of the platforms and political qualifications of the candidates. 
While it may be true that we have recently lost two politically qualified candidates, in my opinion we are well rid of two morally unqualified candi­dates. In the past twenty years, the public's view of the president as chief executive officer and overall leader of America has swelled enormously. As the power of Congress has diminished, the president's position has gained an incredible amount of respect and power. I will not debate here whether this is a good or bad trend, it is simply a fact which must be accepted. Thus the president has become more than the chief policy maker and political ex­ecutive. He sets, in the eyes of the public, the moral standard of America. As a result, any politicain seeking to hold this office should indeed be scrutinized both morally and political­ly. For, although it is somewhat unclear why, the public will indeed look to the president for moral, as well as political, leadership.

Urban Plunge merits serious thought 
Editor's Nate: This is the first in a monthly series related to the Center for Social Concerns. Information about the Urban Plunge can be found at the Cen­ter for Social Concerns at Notre Dame and the Office of Justice Education at Saint Mary's. Deadline for application is October 9. 
"The Urban Plunge -why would I want to spend two daxs of my Christmas vacation doing something like that?" I asked my hall's Plunge representative last year. 
"Trust me," he said. "It's not just two days. If you go, you'll return to campus after break a changed and en­lightened person." He then handed me an application and left my room.

guest column 
Still perplexed as to how this activity could really change my life, I decided that I might as well complete the ap­plication and find out. In retrospect, I am glad that I did because, like he said, I returned with a different attitude about our "just" society. These expe­riences even motivated me last semes­ter to write a column for this page as­king students to write their legislators voicing their support of Senator Paul Simon's (D-ILL) welfare reform bill. Even though the bill never left Simon's committee, his publicist said that their office alone received over 30 letters and thanked us for our support. 
Now it's my turn to convince you to invest two days of your vacation in the Plunge. Hopefully recalling some of my Plunge experiences will help you take the first step toward a new realization about our society as a whole. I know that I'm going "Plunging" again this year and I hope that you join me in what is an unforgettable adventure. 
My Plunge took place in the south side of Chicago in the Englewood com­munity. I carpooled with two women from Saint Mary's. In order to get to our site from the suburbs, we had to drive 10 miles through the most dan­gerous sections of Chicago. The atmo­sphere in our car was tense, even though we were driving during the day on a busy street. We started joking about how we would not stop if some­body tried approaching the car, how we should hide all our valuables, how we would never shop in their ugly and filthy stores and buy their sad-looking merchandise, and how we would not be able to live in such an environment. Everything in the conversation began with "we." It was just impossible for us at the time to view the situation from the perspective of the people sitting on the sidewalks staring at the passing cars. We were affluent kids who had to resort to mockery in order to avoid coming to terms with the one thing from which we have always been protected -poverty. 
We arrived at the Sacred Heart Parish and had to be escorted into the school and retreat house because all doors were locked and bars were on many windows. It reminded me more of a jail than of a religious community. 
Once all the members of my group arrived, we met some of the parish staff. We learned that these people ­both black and white, lay and clergy have sacrificed a lot of time and effort in order to offer the support that is so desperately needed in the community. All the lay people could be doing some­thing that is more financially reward­ing, but both the priests and the lay people couldn't desert that part of so­ciety which is so easily overlooked and forgotten. 
The next day was our only complete day in Englewood. During the morning, we toured a hospital, a senior citizen's center and a school. Nothing was remarkably different about these places from comparable places in the suburbs, except they all had very tight security and very tight budgets. 
During the afternoon, we formed groups of three, and each went on an assigned shopping expedition. My group had to travel about two and a half miles south from the retreat house to a small store in order to buy lunch. While walking on the way we saw the vacant factories that had long since been overtaken by weeds, and the many makeshift shop-like churches of denominations of which I have never heard. One preacher who was outside waxing his Cadillac stopped us and asked us what church we were from. We also received that same question from the Italian grocery store owner who also owned a Cadillac. 
When we returned to the retreat house, we all had the same questions -"Where are the businesses now?" and "What is supporting the community?" Our group leader answered them by saying that the businesses had moved to the Loop and the suburbs in order to remain competitive and that really nothing is supporting the community, and that is why there are so many un­employed, depressed people. The only businesses left were the churches, the taverns and the grocery stores which employ very few people and contribute even less in the way of resources to the community. 
Later in the afternoon we visited Dusable Museum, which focuses its ex­hibits around black history and culture. Our tour began by viewing a carved map of the plight of the blacks. It was appalling to see how inhumanely the blacks were treated when they were separated from their families and shipped to and sold for profit in the United States. We then entered the ar­tists' gallery. I was very surprised by all the dark colors that were used, and by the topics -drugs, alcoholism, teenage pregnancy, unemployment ­which were addressed in the paintings. The guide said that these topics are problems which the artists believe the black community must overcome. Un­til that time, life will remain dismal. 
Our last and definitely most memorable event occurred that eve­ning when each group stayed at a dif­ferent shelter for the homeless. My group was dropped off at our shelter (a converted restaurantbar) at 8 p.m. and we were quickly ushered inside. It just so happened that this shelter was on the corner of the Black, Mexican and Polish communities and fights among the three groups were known to occur. 
Once inside and introduced to the man whom we were going to be helping, we were shown upstairs in order to pray in their chapel before the homeless were allowed to enter for supper. At the top of the stairs, we were met by the two ladies who help run the place with the priest who founded the shelter. 

They were happy to see us because they desperately needed help. They were even happier to learn that we were from Notre Dame because they believed that we represent the future of the Catholic Church. Before they left, they kissed each one of us, wished us success in the future, said that they would pray for us, and asked that we never forget them or their mission in our prayers. I was really moved because I have never been in the presence of people with such great faith. When they touched me, I felt like I wasn't worthy of their kisses or praise. I knew that I should be prais­ing them, but when I opened my mouth, the words I wanted to say just didn't materialize. 
The three of us then entered their chapel. I have never seen anything so beautiful in my life. The room could not have been more than nine by nine, but you could tell by the Christmas decora­tions that they wanted to properly wor­ship God. I learned later that they have a lot to be thankful for because God always provides for them whenever needed. We were told that they are most thankful to God for always finding them food donors. Besides serving three meals a day, the shelter also provides weekly food bags which consist of some fruits and canned vegetables and many different boxed goods. 
After finishing our prayers, serving dinners to the homeless, washing the dishes, and organizing the weekly food packages, we had a chance to sit down with the three other men who were reg­ular volunteers at the shelter. They spent their evenings and some of their days at the shelter, and all they received in return was food, clothing and a place to live. The first man graduated from college a few years ago but was not satisfied with the self­centered business world. Instead, he wanted to use his skills in order to help others. Since meeting the priest, he has "worked" both day and night comfort­ing the less fortunate. 
The next man worked during the day as a bus driver and at night as a shelter volunteer because he wanted to help others as other volunteers originally helped him. Six months before we ar­rived, this man was an unemployed al­coholic and drug user; but instead of ignoring him like the rest of society did, the volunteers befriended him and en­rolled him in their local hospital's detoxification program. They were also the ones who also found him his first stable job as a bus driver. 
The third man just finished his DUI probation work at the center but was continuing to volunteer his services. While I was there, he complained about all the hard work with no pay, but I could tell that he enjoyed what he was doing because he was allowed to be a leader. He befriended me because I was willing to listen to his exaggerated stories about his women and his trips to Mexico. 
Later the next morning, our tour leader arrived to take us back to the retreat house, and though he was waiting in a running car, we all hesitated at the front door. I felt a def­inite struggle between my newly dis­covered world and my already estab­lished world. In a way I didn't want to return because I knew my services were needed there, but subconsciously I knew I couldn't stay. We enthusias­tically agreed even though we knew that we never would. 
Later that night, my dad arrived at the retreat house in order to drive us back to the suburbs. He was wearing all black, including a hat to cover his white hair. The two Saint Mary's girls and I laughed under our breaths at his paranoia. Only two days before, we had been just as nervous, but we seemed to forget that. This time as we drove through the same filthy neighborhood there were no jokes cracked -there was very little talk at all as we tried to dis­cern what just happened to us during the past 48 hours.

P.O. Box Q 
American tourists not always bad 
Dear Editor: 
Mr. Robert Hennig, who is ap­parently stalking the streets of London for poor American tourists in dark socks to make fun of, should learn to lighten up a bit. 
Mr. Hennig claims that he can pick an American out in any crowd, and I agree that he probably could. I wonder how many of those tourists would mind being singled out as Americans (except, of course by a raving terror­ist). 
Mr. Hennig also claims that the American is usually accompanied by "whining kids". So what. Any kid thousands of miles from his or her home and in a foreign country deserves to whine a little. I find it particularly ad­mirable that any parents who would make the effort to visit Europe should spend the time to save the thousands of dollars necessary to bring their children along for a once-in-a-lifetime experience. 
It is not surprising that a person who is slightly uneasy in a foreign environ­ment should make more noise than "forty natives". This is undoubtedly an­noying to the natives and to sophisti­cated travelers, but cannot be used to explain away anti-Americanism. More likely it is a result of envy of our "sheer power" for which we are "admired". Success almost always created a con­venient scapegoat, just as Japan's eco­nomic success has generated hatred of Japan here in America. 
Finally, it should be pointed out that tourism is Great Britain's largest in­dustry, and nobody likes to have to rely on a complete stranger to supply his or her needs. In light of this it might seem that many things in many foreign countries are a "quaint show put on for tourists". 
This is not meant to be an attack on Mr. Hennig, but rather a gentle reminder that he, too, <I presume) is an American. Can anyone point me towards Big Ben?

of my childhood, childlike curiosities became a reality. No real physical damage was done and it did not even hurt. I just felt I was not seeing as well as I should have been and as a result am now sporting Liz Clalrborne frames number 12, blond. 
Choosing the frames, having them adjusted, and adjusting to life with them has been fun, yes, but even more so I have been enlightened In regards to all the quirks which accompany spectacle sporting. 
Like keeping them clean. If a lightweight, thin tissue is used, you can get a pretty clean, clear lense. However, if you are partial to soft, comforting tissues as I am, you find you must wipe the lenses again in order to remove all of the fuzzies left over from your Puffs. And someone please let me know if breathing on your lenses before wiping them is really as effective as spraying them with Windex or Visine Visaclean. 
I have found that the means to a dirty end are innumerable. Dust particles are not surpris­ing and easy enough to wipe off. Sometimes though, I find I am a little too quick to don my 
glasses in the morning and end up with a nice mascara imprint of my eyelashes on the lenses. 
Spots are a big problem for me too. During my perfect­vision days, eating grapefruit was a hassle because I hated getting squirted In the eye as I dug ln. Now my glasses serve as a shield and instead of sharp stinging In the eyes, I get strategically shot grapefruit juice spots on my lenses. 
Even worse than little spots is having my vision totally obscured while walking in the rain. I have always laughed at the thought of little windshield wipers for glasses; now though, I can understand the prac­ticality behind such an idea. Attempting to see and avoid puddles, as well as people, with water pouring down both sides of your glasses is about as easy as seeing ten inches ahead of you in a drive-thru car wash. 
Another problem I have been having involves physical con­tact. Often when I hug some­one, I accidently check him or her in the cheek with the cor­ner of my frames. It makes them really glad to see me, I'm sure. 
A male hornrim wearer elaborated upon this theme a bit further. His dilemma, and perhaps a future one of yours or mine if we are lucky, in­volves the confrontation of lenses over the infamous good­night kiss. Nothing can ruin the moment like glasses getting in the way and needing to remove them. Sometimes the price paid for good vision is a little too high. 
Glasses can give you a differ­ent appearance and make you unrecognizable to even your closest friends. People tell me I look so businesslike with my spectacles on, and one of my friends said she has been told

she looks smart while wearing 
hers. More than giving you a 
little different image, glasses can confuse people in regards to whom you really are. 
Back in August after not having seen some of my friends for over a year, 1 was really looking forward to all of the beginning-of-the-year, back-to-school greetings. Well I was quite befuddled when two of my best friends just stared at me out of the corners of their eyes looking very per­plexed and finally mumbled, "HI... and you are?" 
How about when, glassless, you run into someone you first

met while wearing your glasses. You greet them and they give you that blank "Who the heck is this person?" look. Then, flash of recognition, and profuse apologies because they "did not recognize you without your glasses." 
Wearing glasses has been a decent experience so far. I can see better, change my Image, confuse my friends, and look smart. There are admittedly a few minor obstacles to conquer while wearing them but at least I have never had to overcome the fourth-grade banter of "Four Eyes" like Jennie Barnes did.

Runaways, surviviors 
meet for league titles Giants have upper hand 
Associated Press 
ST. LOUIS -Pitching and power always have dominated baseball's postseason competi­tion. By those standards, the San Francisco Giants should rout the St. Louis Cardinals in the National League playoffs. 
The Giants, bolstered by some big trades, led the major leagues in earned run average and hit twice as many homers as St. Louis. Since the start of divisional play in 1969, the club that hit more home runs during the regular season has won 26 of 36 playoff series. 
The Cardinals, meanwhile, are missing their only slugger. Jack Clark's right ankle is hur­ting and he will be limited to pinch hitting for another week if the series goes that long. ' 
St. Louis will rely on its speed to overcome a loss of power. The Cardinals stole 248 bases, most in the majors and nearly double San Francisco's total. 
The Giants' stolen-base rate of 57 percent was the worst in baseball, but their catchers threw out more runners than any team. 
Tigers, Twins defy odds 
Associated Press 
MINNESOTA -Two teams that made the most of their ability, the Detroit Tigers and Minnesota Twins, defied big odds in winning their division titles in the American League in 1987. 
The Tigers won the AL east by using a unique chemistry in edging the powerful Toronto Blue Jays. 
The Twins used a combina­tion of power and pitching in holding off mild charges from the Kansas City Royals and Oakland Athletics in the AL west. 
The Tigers, playing in a toug­her division, had to win a lot more games than the Twins (98 to 85) in order to reach the playoffs. And the Tigers held an 8-4 edge over the Twins during regular season play. 
But the Tigers may be ex­hausted after having played Toronto seven times in the final 11 days of the season. 

Irish claim FSU's spot in AP Poll 
Associated Press 
With Florida State's loss to Miami of Florida Saturday, Notre Dame has moved into fourth place in the Associated Press college football poll Mon­day. 
The race between Nebraska and Miami of Florida for second place behind Oklahoma tightened, and Syracuse and Oklahoma State made the rankings for the first time this season while Texas A&M, Washington and Iowa dropped out. 
Oklahoma's 56-3 rout of Iowa State earned the Sooners 46 of 60 first-place votes and 1,183 of a possible 1,200 points from a nationwide panel of sports writ­ers and sportscasters. Okla­homa has been No. 1 in every poll this season. 
Eight first-place votes and 1,120 points went to Nebraska, which has been No. 2 every week. The Cornhuskers rallied to beat South Carolina 30-21. 
The other six first-place bal­lots, along with 1,012 points, went to Miami, which remained third with a dra­matic 26-25 victory over Florida State. The Seminoles fell from fourth place to sixth. 
Baseball takes on aggressive identity with Murphy 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Sports Writer 
After watching his team play five fall scrimmages, first­year Irish baseball coach Pat Murphy has found plenty of reasons to be satisfied with his team's progress, and almost as many reasons to get totally frustrated. 
"We've been impressive in every scrimmage, but we're a long way from being a good team," Murphy said. "We're better than some of these guys think they are, and winning will take care of their lack of con­fidence. 
"It's very tough taking over a team that was 15-29 last year without any chance to recruit anyone, but I'll guarantee that if there are any people in the world I want to work with, it's these guys. They're willing to go to the wall." 
One thing that has to please Murphy is that the Irish are starting to attain the identity of being an aggressivee bal­lclub -an identity that is sorely needed on a team that was 6-17 in extra-inning games or

games decided by two runs or less. 
"They've adapted to an ag­gressive style of play," Murphy said. "We've got to believe in our individual roles, execute our roles, play consis­tently, work our butts off, have fun, and we'll win." 
"We're going to be a scrappy team that's going to score runs in little ways rather than with big hits," said senior catcher/outfielder Pat O'Brien. "We have a couple of guys who can hit it out, but we're making sure we're hitting strikes, moving runners around, and are disciplined at the plate in­stead of waiting for the home run. 
"It all comes from the coach. 

He takes a lot more risks than (previous coach Larry) Gallo, and that's the type of team we need to have." 
Still, Murphy is not encour­aged with the defensive play of his team so far, both in pitching and in fielding. Murphy cur­rently has a staff of 18 pitchers. 
"We have a bunch of no­names who, when they throw strikes, could be competitive," said Murphy. "They have worked harder and have been pushed harder than any other group. Two things they have to overcome are the ideas that you have to strike out everyone 
and  that  you  have  to  throw  
hard."  
One  pitcher  who  has  im­ 

pressed Murphy is senior Mike Harmon, last year's team

"We need to get a lot more confidence in ourselves and in our pitches," Harmon said. "We're still young in game ex­perience, and we need to get an attitude that every time out there we're going to win." 
The infield looks to be one of Notre Dame's strong points this coming spring. Senior Pat Pesavento, drafted after last season by the Boston Red Sox, returns to shortstop flanked by fellow returning starters, second baseman Mike Moshier and third baseman Steve Skupien. Senior Tim Hutson and sophomore Dave Legus are competing for the first base job, while sophomore Ed Lund has shown indications that he can bat his way into the lineup. 
Four players are battling for the starting catching position, including power-hitting senior Chris Flynn, O'Brien, junior Craig Pavlina, and freshman Jeff Knight. 
Last year's freshman phenom, Dan Peltier, returns to the outfield, though a hand injury has him out of action right now. Junior John Flanagan, O'Brien, Kentucky transfer James Sass, converted sophomore catcher Dave Yaw­man, and sophomore Mike Rotkis could fill the remaining outfield spots. Rotkis could also see time as designated hitter.

Sparked by a strong defensive effort, the Rugby Club downed Marquette, 24-0, Saturday to improve its record to 5-l.

Sean Higgins led the attack with two scores, while John Sheehy and Mark Connolly had one each in Notre Dame's third shutout victory of the season. The B-Team won 26-4, and the C-Team was victorious by a 12-0 count. 
The Irish will take their 5-1 record to Northwestern Sat­urday. "The Wildcats always tough," O'Connell said. "I think this weekend will tell a lot." 
The Rowing Club found the waters a little rough against some of the best East Coast squads in the Head of the Potomac Regatta in Washington, D.C. last weekend. 
The women's eights took second and sixth, while the women's four finished fourth. "I was pleased with the effort considering the weather and the long drive," coach Susan Pusek said. Meanwhile, the men's eights took third and eighth, and the men's fours finished fifth and sixth in the regatta. 
"We had trouble getting off the docks because of the traffic," men's coach Chris Nye said. "When we got to the line, they had started without us. So we had to race against the clock. I'm pleased with the effort, but I'm not sure it's indicative of how we could have done if we had raced someone." 
The men's team will travel to Boston in two weeks, while the women's team travels to Tennessee Oct. 31.

NFL players meet 
Associated Press 

CHICAGO -Striking NFL players, with reports of addi­tional defections imminent, met Monday to determine ways to get management back to the bargaining table, including dropping the sticky issue of free agency from their agenda. 
While the union was buoyed by minuscule attendance at the first strike games on Sunday, of them, but Head Coach Debbie Laverie was not very pleased with her team's perfor­mance. 
"They went into it knowing they were better players and just weren't as sharp as the doubles have been," said Laverie. "The matches were a little closer than they should have been." 
The singles matches pro­vided much better perfor­mances. 
"I think the girls realized that just because our team was supposed to win didn't mean Taylor's girls were just going to give up," said Laverie. 
Jen Block turned in an out­standing performance, win-
reports continued that there would be additional defections of veteran players this week to add to the nearly 100 who crossed picket lines in the first two weeks of the strike.

Cahill sweeps competition at Midwest Invitational tourney 
By ROBERT MITCHELL Sports Writer 
With the women's tennis team falling upon hard times at Evanston, Ill. this weekend in the Midwest Invitational, freshman Ce Ce Cahill picked the team up as she won five matches to capture the singles competition. 
Cahill defeated Cindy Gal­loway ,of Northwestern, Madeline Willard of Iowa, Marie Hibbard of Kansas and Chris Nagle of Tennessee, to set up the final match against Tracy Trepps of Kansas. 
Trepps won the first set however Cahill regrouped to win the match in three sets, 3-6, 7-6, 6-1. 
The tournament, which was hosted by Northwestern Uni­versity, featured the wrath of mother nature. Played in forty degree weather, a swirling wind hindered the players' ability to control the ball. 
The tournament consisted of one draw each for singles and doubles as well as a consolation bracket for first rounnd losers. 
Natalie Illig lost to Chris Nagel of Tennes&ee in the first round, 6-3, 2-6, 1-6. Stephanie Tolstedt lost to Kristen Willey of Northwestern, 3-6, 0-6. Cap­tain Michelle Dasso lost to Anne Marie Ovmik of Min­nesota, 4-6, 4-6. 
In the consolation bracket the Irish players had better luck. Illig, the Tulsa, Okla. na­tive, had the most success. Illig advanced to the third round before losing to Anne Drebrythe of Minnesota, 7-5, 6­1. 
In doubles play, Notre Dame found the road a little smoot­her. The tandem of Cahill and Dasso played extremely well, defeating the Northwestern team of Hendry and Galloway, 6-2, 6-1, before losing in a heartbreaker to the Northwes­tern team of Evans and Staple, 0-6, 7-6, 4-6. 
Dasso said that the team's rE;)cent injuries· to Resa Kelly and Alice Lohrer did not en­hance the team's performance. 
"We are all dealing with it," said Dasso. "We are doing the best we can, and I feel that we have enough depth on the team to compensate for the injur­ies." 
The tournament was a four day event, but the players did not feel fatigue played a decisive role in their level of play. 
Next on the schedule for the Irish is the North Star Confer­ence Championships. The team will square off against the likes of Marquette, Northern Illinois and Evansville.

Field hockey routs Albion, 8-0 
By MOLLY MAHONEY Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame field hockey team came out of its corner swinging Saturday, firing a barrage of shots on goal and overwhelming Albion 8-0. 
The Irish took 55 shots on goal while preventing Albion from getting even one shot off in the entire game. 
Abion has yet to win a game in its series against the Irish, and, in keeping with that tradi­tion, Notre Dame gained its third victory, bringing the record to 3-3-1 for the season. 
"We needed this opportunity earlier in the season," said Irish head coach Jill Linden­feld, "This type of game gives us more time to execute and draw success offensively." 
The persistent attacks of the forward line staggered Albion, leaving the team down 7-0 at halftime. 
Sophomore Debra Charles­worth led the charge by contri­buting a goal and an assist, while sophomore Mindy Breen tallied two goals. 
Seniors Anne McGlinn and co-captain Benet DeBerry each added a goaL DeBerry got the ball rolling early in the first half by scoring the first goal of the game off a pass from senior Janet Budnik. 
Junior Christine Gregory showed marked improvement, finding the net twice on back­to-hack goals in the first half. 
Freshman Cornell Wrisby provided the only goal of the second half to complete the the. scoring in a game in which every Irish player saw action. 
"I was able to see more con­sistency in the offense," said Lindenfeld, "but we still have a problem with accuracy and converting scoring opportuni­ties into goals." 
The Irish will need to sustain their momentum as they prepare to face Central Mic­higan at home this Thursday. 
"It was a good overall win for the whole squad," said Lin­denfeld. "It puts us at .500 and is a good confidence builder going into two straight home games." 
'Instant Football' tests players, fans

This week's National Football League games featured reclamations projects, replacement players, fill-ins. Scabs. 
Rick Rietbrock 
Assistant Sports Editor 

To make it more official, all results and records from these games will count. 
The NFL Players' Association strike got old before it started. The owners insist the greedy players are going to soak them all into bankruptcy with free agency. 
The players feel manipulated, like pawns, and they want some input in their future. 
It's hard to feel sorry for owners of players that are so greedy, when the miserable Green Bay Packers turned in a record profit last season. 
On the other side, it's also hard to sympathize with a bunch of $300,000-a-year 'pawns.' 
While the players were out picketing, the owners decided, with infinite benovolence, to give the fans their football with replacement players. These fans love foot­ball, not the players, the owners thought, so they would come out in pretty decent numbers to see these games, at least out of curiosity. 
The owners hoped they would look good for this noble act. Though stuck in the perils of this awful strike, they still would go to extreme measures to provide their beloved fans with the game they love, just as a service. 
Their 'self-sacrificing' service netted several outstand­ing individual efforts in games that were better than they had reason to be, on the whole. 
Washington's Ed Hubbert passed for 334 yards, 255 of them to Anthony Allen for a Redskins team record against St. Louis, which still had eight starters who crossed the picket lines. The Cardinals defense will probably claim it was caught by surprise because it couldn't scout Hubbert and Allen. It better claim something. 
Joey Clinkscales of Pittsburgh caught six passes for 150 yards. Obviously, Mark Malone did not cross the picket lines. 
Gary Hogeboom of Indianapolis tied a Colts record by passing for five touchdowns. Here's hoping to a long strike, huh Gary? 
The day also provided some humiliation for regulars. Tony Collins, a starter in New England's regular backfield, found the scabs to be a pain. He gained 24 yards on 15 carries and fumbled twice. That won't look good when renogiating time comes. 
The Rams' Charles White managed 18 yards on nine carries. No one was confusing him with Eric Dickerson. 
Judging by the attendance figures of the games, the owners probably were hoping to provide a service to a few more people than they did. And instead of being the kind holders of the fans' best interests, the owners are looking like con artists, trying to soak fans as much fans money as possible using anything as an excuse to sell a ticket. 
The games were also a bargaining tool, however. By proving the game could go on without the players, maybe the union would realize the owners meant business. 
While trying to look like the well-meaning givers didn't work, using the games to give the players a sense of ur­gency has. 
While die hard fans were enjoying the days of the new stars, the players were figuring out how a playoff berth may be affected by the performance of their replacements. 
Poor attendance may have let owners know fans won't support the replacement games, but they have succeeded in worrying the players. The threat of losing a playoff berth because of a poor scab team has sent the players scurrying to Chicago to meet with NFLPA President Gene Upshaw and may bring a quick end to the strike. 
If Upshaw doesn't call it off, it may get ugly. Some 
teams will get more players back than others, giving them 
an advantage, unless it's St. Louis. Ifone team has a group 
of its players cross the picket lines, a team close to it in 
the standings will find it hard to stay on strike and watch 
its playoff chances dwindle. 
Players' Association unity would be put to the test, a 
test it has failed miserably thus far. 
It's likely the players will come back to play soon, getting
