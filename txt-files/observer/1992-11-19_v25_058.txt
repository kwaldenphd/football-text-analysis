Sleep-out to highlight ND 'Homeless Week' 
By JASON WILLIAMS News Writer 
Notre Dame for the Homeless Week will host a sleep-out tonight in Stepan Center in an effort to bring the issues of homelessness and poverty to light for students. 
"The sleep-out is not intended to mock homelessness by any means," said Mike Griffin, Stu­dent Government chief of staff and co-chair of Notre Dame for the Homeless Week. "The main purpose is to give students an opportunity to talk to homeless people." 
According to Griffin, the highlight of the sleep-out will be the opportunity for students to 
Linebacker relocation gets setback 
By SARAH DORAN News Writer 
The Area Plan Commission voted 10-4 at a meeting Tues­day against recommending the City Council rezone a residen­tial property on which the Linebacker Lounge would relo­cate. 
The Linebacker is being forced out of its current build­ing by plans to widen Indiana 23. 
"The vote was probably heav­ily influenced by the many neighbors {of the proposed site) who came to the meeting and voiced their concern of the safety, parking, and traffic problems that the relocation would bring to their area," said Scott Kugler of the Area Plan Commission. 
"The vote basically indicated that it is okay for the

"We're going to split the homeless people into small groups with the students," he said. "That way both the home­less people and the students will be able to share stories with one another. They can ask us questions just like we can ask them questions." 

Along with the expected 10 
.residents of the center, Father Tom McDermott, director of special activities for Campus Ministry, and Lou Nanni, direc­tor of the Center for the Home­less, will give presentations on the lifestyles and attitudes of homeless people. 
"We're going to show some

very interesting documentary films on homelessness along with having presentations made by faculty, campus ministry and counselors form the South Bend Center for the Homeless," Griffin said. "We just want to get students together in a very informal setting with homeless people to. discuss issues of poverty and homelessness." 
Notre Dame for the Homeless Week is being held in conjunc­tion with National Hunger and Homeless Week. Chairpersons Griffin and Kellie Abbott have organized the week's events with the help of Campus Min­istry and the Center for Social Concerns. 
"We have been pleased with student participation in the planned activities up to this point," Griffin said. "We were especially pleased with the turnouts for the discussions in the dorms." Strong student re­sponse has given organizers good reason to expect large numbers for the sleep-out tonight. 
"We're expecting anywhere from 80 to 100 students," Grif­fin said. "All they have to do is show up at Stepan Center by 9 
p.m. with either a sleeping bag or a blanket." 
Students or faculty with questions about the sleep-out or other activities this week may contact student government at 239-7668. 
Ed Broderick, senior from Dillon Hall, shops at the Outhouse Enterprise Boutique. The boutique will be selling T-shirts, buttons, and bumper stickers with "peace and save the earth" messages in the LaFortune Student Center through Friday. 


New Church catechism contains few changes 
By JENNIFER HABRYCH News Writer 
The Roman Catholic Church released its first universal catechism out of Rome in over 400 years Monday. The document contained little change in Church teachings and doctrine. 
"We all would have been surprised had their been any major changes," said Lawrence Cunningham, theology department chair. "The catechism is a restating of tradition, doctrine and morals with Rome's support behind it." 
"The last place you would see anything revolutionary would be out of Rome," Cunningham continued. 
Cunningham clarified that while this is the first catechism to come out of Rome in 426 years, there have been count­less catechisms issued at the national and local levels throughout the world. 
This universal catechism reaffirmed the Church's bans on divorce, abortion, and any contraception that is not natu­ral. One change is that the segment condemning homo­sexuality now also urges Catholics to display compassion for homosexuals. 
Also, the catechism inter­prets the Seventh Com­mandment, "Thou shalt not steal," as a call for economic and social justice. The cate­chism does not enumerate any new sins nor eliminate any transgressions formerly considered sins. 
Ralph Mcinerny, philosophy department chair, said the new catechism is a very positive thing. 
"There was a lot of confusion about Church teachings and the direction the Church was taking," said Mcinerny. "Some people were believing in everything and calling it 'Catholic.' This reaffirms the Church's position." 
According to Cunningham, this catechism "is not directed toward the people in the pews," but is directed toward the bishops to guide their writings of future catechisms for their communities. 
"(The new catechism) is more of a resource book than an actual catechism that

Bishops defeat document that would have buried question of women's ordination 
WASHINGTON (AP)-Roman Catholic bishops defeated a keenly cGntroversial document on women Wednesday after struggling over it for nine years. Women's ordination, far from laid to rest by Vatican edicts, was at the heart of their disagreement. 
It was the first time in history that the bishops had failed to reach a consensus on an in­tended pastoral letter bearing their collective authority. 
Requiring 190 votes for pas­sage -two-thirds of the eligi­ble bishops -the teaching document received 137 "yes" votes and 110 "no" votes after five hours of strenuous debate over two days. 
The repeatedly revised doc­ument, its fourth version the most restrictive of all, had been sharply assailed by many women's organizations and other Catholic groups. 
It would have precipitated "another tremendous crisis in the church," said Archbishop Rembert Weakland of Milwau­kee. "We would lose another generation of very wonderful women." 

Pope John Paul II 
The question of ordaining women emerged as the nub of the bishops' discussion, although Pope John Paul II has ruled the subject off limits. 
Asked if this meant "the genie is now out the bottle," Bishop Pierre DuMaine of San Jose, Calif., said "yes," adding at a news conference, "The debate will continue." 
Several others said the conflict over the issue demonstrates that it demands fuller, open discussion. Calling it the "driving" core of the debate here, Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago said: 
"You know as well as I that a simple fiat" decreeing silence "will not settle the issue." 
He won passage of a plan for more "study and dialogue" about the ban on female priests, not to contradict it but to explain it more persuasively. 
"What we need now is to en­gage our people, to truly listen, to explain, to challenge to show that our tradition really makes sense," he said. 
The rejected document firmly prohibited women's ordination. While affirming women's equal dignity, the document un­derlined sexual differences. It condemned discriminatory sexism but said women partly share blame for it. 
The Vatican had intervened repeatedly in shaping the con­tents, but Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro declined to comment on the vote, calling it a decision of the American bishops. 
Navarro called attention to a document issued by the pope in 1988 that, among other things, condemned discrimination and reaffirmed a ban on female priests.

INSIDE COLUMN 



Should we take the low road or the high one? 
There are two ways to get to the top. 
Politicos do it one way. Revolutionaries do it the other. 
We see too many politicos in our genera­

tion. You know who they Rolando de 
are. The young upwardly Aguiar 
mobile suburban white Associate Sports 
kids who see their ________ education as a means to an ignoble end: what they call financial security, and what should be called financial tyranny. 
The politicos have no imagination. They follow the same paths that brought their parents success. They mimic their successful forebears with their tastes in clothing, music, food and politics. These all-too-typical college students are busy climbing the ladder that their parents have built for them, where they will find easy footing toward a secure, albeit mundane future. 
Meanwhile, the revolutionaries are off in anothe.r philosophical world, creating new ladders and developing radical ways to reach their own goals. They struggle at the bottom. choosing to ignore the system of advancement built by the generations before them, instead wrestling with idealism. 
Once they have perfected their idealistic vision, they must scream to be heard, and throw temper tantrums to be noticed by the mainstream. They look like immature ado­lescents, but in reality they are the most sensitive and considerate individuals society has to offer. They have believed in themselves, and achieved without the help of others. 
I try my hardest to be a revolutionary. I want to change the world, to turn it upside-down. But I fear that I am already climbing that ladder built by my parents. They are paying for my education at Notre Dame, which produces swarms of businesspeople. I work for the most respected mainstream student publication at this school, writing little that could change anyone's life (unless football can change your life). 
Fortunately, I haven't yet registered for any accounting classes, joined the Knights o Columbus, or supported a conservative politician. But I am very afraid of where I'm headed, and of where our generation is going. 
I want to do it myself, but I also want the security of having help. I want to strive for something more than financial success, but I don't want to struggle to feed my children. 

However, I know that I cannot have it both ways. The time has come to make a decision: will I start climbing the corporate ladder. reaping the financial rewards offered by the mainstream? Or will I build my own life, out o materials that I earn by myself? 
If I do the former, I will undoubtedly end up one of the typical white suburbanites engaged in the mundane existence of the businessperson. 
By trying to be a revolutionary, I risk financial failure. 
But I also guarantee myself satisfaction. I will have built my own ladder.

Malcolm's widow: Movie portrays her as aggressive 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP)­Betty Shabazz, the widow of Malcolm X, said their marriage and now the film about his life have thrust her into a role she never sought. 
"I have been propelled on a bridge, on a trail, on a platform by this man called Malcolm," Shabazz told an audience at Harvard on Tuesday. 
While she praised the Spike Lee film "Malcolm X," Shabazz said the portrayal of her own role makes her seem more assertive than she was. 
Angela Bassett, who portrays her in the film, "came into that movement and cast her hooks and came up with the big fish," Shabazz said. "And I was always holding back. I would never have developed objectives to wheel the fish in." 
But she said she was proud of her husband's legacy. 
"Some of you who perhaps don't agree with him today, 10 or 20 years from now when your children are trying to secure their human rights or are denied options and opportunities, you will remember Malcolm."

Although many students looking for jobs working for peace and justice assume they must work for free, Professor of government George Lopez said there is a market for such jobs. 
Lopez, acting Regan director of the Kroc Institute for Inter­national Peace Studies, said traditional, socio-political and service opportunities exist, and suggested that students try to incorporate a justice or peace issue into a traditional job, provided that it is possible. 
"Persistence pays off" for students looking for such a job, said Lopez. Following up your resume with phone calls and visits is part of ~·getting an edge." He said it may surprise some students to learn that a resume should be longer than the one-page standard. 
Experience is essential, ac­cording to Lopez. Seniors with weak resumes should consider taking the time after graduation to get that experience. He encouraged students to "create possibilities through flexibility."

It is time for U.N. to be 'peace maker' 
By NANCY DUNN 
News Writer 
After more than 45 years, it is time for the United Nations to switch from being a peace keeper to a peace maker, ac­cording to Paul Tierney, who traveled to four sites to oversee peace-keeping operations as a delegate to a United Nations (UN) association. 
Due to the end of the Cold War, the UN now enjoys more freedom in its peace-keeping operations, he said. Establish­ing 13 new operations in the past three years, the UN has matched the number it set up between 1945 and 1989.

While this new freedom is a positive sign, Tierney said there need to be reforms in the organization. As a delegate to the United Nations Association of the U.S., he evaluated the effectiveness of the UN peace­keeping operations. 
Tierney credited the efforts of the troops in Cambodia, El Sal­vador, Cyprus and Golan Heights, recognizing their courage and dedication. Not only do the troops remove mines, patrol buffer zones, and disarm militias, but they are slowly being used in non-mili­tary settings to build roads or instruct local citizens in water purification techniques, he said. 
While he praised the troops, Tierney said civilian leadership is seriously lacking within the organization. 
Tierney suggested the creation of new standards for the selection and training of 
personnel. He suggested the 
establishing a standing force 
with common training to reduce 
confusion within the forces. 
To play this new role, the UN needs more money, Tierney said. He gave three suggestions to increase revenue. First, establish a tax on the sale of weapons. Second, payments to the UN should be seen as part of the Defense budget, instead of being part of the State De­partment budget, he said. Third, interest should be charged on late payments. 
This year, the United States is responsible for about 30 
,percent of the UN's budget. Tierney recognized that this number should be reduced, but noted that this averages out to only four dollars a person, while in countries such as Norway the payment averages out to about 13 dollars a person.

Clinton· calls his one-on-one session with Bush 'terrific' 

WASHINGTON (AP) -Presi­dent-elect Clinton swept tri­umphantly into the capital Wednesday and held a "terrific meeting" with President Bush, soliciting advice on more than a dozen potential global problems the Democrat could inherit. 
Nine weeks before his inau­guration, Clinton also made a symbolic visit to a crime­plagued black business district. ''I'll do my best not to get out of touch," he promised well­wishers. Thousands of people strained against police lines for a glimpse. 
"I hope you'll never be dis­appointed," he told one sup­porter. 
Clinton said he and Bush dis­cussed such global tinderboxes as Russia, Bosnia and Somalia. "He was very candid," the

Several New York City schools, including Lee's alma mater, Junior High School 113 in 

Brooklyn, sent groups of students to the movie on its opening day. Non-student crowds were heavy in Manhattan, with several theaters reporting first-night sellouts. 
The movie follows Malcolm X from his days as a street hustler through his association with the Nation of Islam and his 1965 murder in Harlem's Audubon Ballroom. 
Newspaper critics were full of praise, and the reviews from the mostly black crowd were unfailingly upbeat for the 3 hour, 21 minute epic starring Denzel Washington.

Elwanda Neidlinger, owner of the Linebacker, called the vote "biased and very unfair be­cause most people who were at the meeting have never come in to see what kind of place it is. They didn't want to listen to anything I had to say."

president-elect said. "He gave me a lot of insights. The Amer­ican people should be pleased." 
"It was a terrific meeting," Clinton said. The White House characterized the talks as "warm and informative." The meeting ran 45 minutes over schedule. 
Bush was waiting in the White House driveway to extend a handshake as Clinton stepped from his armored black limousine -on time, notable for the often-tardy Arkansas governor. 
The White House visit was the first stop on a two-day whirlwind of high-powered meetings and social engage­ments with the lions of the Washington establishment. Clinton's visit was intended to pave the way for a smooth transition and signal the new president's readiness to deal with Washington insiders. 
Demonstrating his willingness to be a good neighbor to the community, Clinton went directly from the White House to Northwest Washington for a walking tour of one of the city's black business districts. 
Clinton said he was trying to demonstrate his recognition that Washington is "a city ­not just government buildings" -made up of "people who don't want a handout but a handup." 
Clinton ducked into the Hamilton Seafood Grocery, the Hamilton Laundromat and other stores near the Georgia Avenue intersection.

An English translation of the new catechism is not expected until January. 
"I feel that our presence at the meeting really did sway them. If the bar were to move, our property values would go down and our neighborhood would be dangerously unsafe for the children and elderly who live here," she said. 
The City Council will make the final decision on the rezon­ing proposal and will hold a public hearing on Dec. 7.

Former prime minister of Pakistan is arrested 
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP)­The government arrested former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and her top advisers at a huge political rally Wednes­day after they defied a ban on protest and called for the overthrow of the government. 
Bhutto had threatened that 100,000 marchers would storm Parliament. But the march, scheduled to begin 10 miles from the capital in Rawalpindi, was disrupted before it began. 
Police barricaded the route, fired tear gas into the crowd and beat protesters. In the cap­ital, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif imposed emergency measures and troops patrolled in machine-gun mounted trucks. Thousands were de­tained around the country. 
"My arrest won't make any difference. The struggle will continue," Bhutto said in a brief

Bhutto agreed to board the plane for Karachi after the gov­ernment promised to release all opposition party supporters who were members of Parlia­ment. 
Bhutto, an articulate politician with a well-tested ability to attract crowds, says that Sharif's Islamic government is corrupt and repressive and rose to power through rigged elections. She wants President Ghulam Ishaq Khan to establish an interim government that would oversee new elections. 
But her demands are unlikely to be met. Sharif's government has a solid majority in Parliament. 

Sen. Kerry urges reward for Vietnam 
HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -Sen. John Kerry said Wednesday that President Bush should re­ward Vietnam within a month for its increased cooperation in accounting for American MIAs. 
Kerry, D-Mass. and two other members of his Senate committee on Americans miss­ing in action during the Viet­nam War were shown Viet­nam's military headquarters, military documents, photos of dead and captured U.S. ser­vicemen and other MIA arti­facts during a visit this week. 
Kerry said a letter Bush wrote to Vietnamese President Le Due Anh pledges that cooperation from Vietnam on the POW/MIA issue will be met with reciprocal actions by the United States. 
Kerry said members of his committee visiting Hanoi are strongly inclined to recommend that Bush reward Vietnam. The committee is to complete a final report on Dec. 19. 
"It is my personal judgment that the president should not wait for our final report," Kerry said. 
But the visiting senators said they doubted full normalization of relations was imminent. 
Parliament again says 'no' to Czechoslovakian division 
PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) -Parliament on Wednesday rejected a bill calling for the breakup of Czechoslovakia by year's end without a referen­dum, heightening the country's constitutional crisis. 
The bill fell three votes short of the necessary majority in the Slovak part of the lower cham­ber, or House of Nations. It had passed the Czech part of the lower chamber, as well as the House of the People, the upper chamber of the 300-seat bi­cameral legislature. 
Law requires each of the three sections to pass the bill by a three-fifths majority. Only the federal parliament has author­ity to dissolve the 7 4-year-old Slovak state. 
A similar bill was defeated on Oct. 1. Deputies voted to schedule another vote next Tuesday. 
Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus and his Slovak counterpart Vladimir Meciar, who emerged victorious from June elections, agreed last spring to split the country of 15 million people after failing to resolve differ­ences over post-Communist reforms. 
The leaders of the western Czech lands, which are wealth­ier and have twice the popula­tion of Slovakia, wish to move more swiftly to a free-market economy than do their Slovak colleagues. 
Cabinets in both republics have negotiated treaties divid­ing up federal assets and gov­erning future economic rela­tions between the two states in a free-trade zone.

Scientists: Disaster is imminent 

WASHINGTON (AP) -In a few decades it will be too late to reverse trends to environmen­tal disaster that would bring vast misery to humanity, said an appeal made public Wednesday by more than 1,500 scientists from around the world. 
"The greatest peril is to be­come trapped in spirals of envi­ronmental decline, poverty and unrest leading to social, eco­nomic and environmental col­lapse," they said in a four-page "Warning to Humanity." 
The statement was coordi­nated by Henry Kendall, an American who won the Nobel prize for physics in 1990. He now heads the Union of Con­cerned Scientists, a private ad­vocacy group on environmental issues. 

"No more than one or a few decades remain before the chance to avert the threats we now confront will be lost and the prospects for humanity immeasurably diminished," the scientists said. 
Kendall told reporters that political effects are already visi­ble in the large movements of people caused in part by degradation of the environ­ment. He cited the flow of refugees from eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, emigra­tion from North Africa to France, Spain and Italy and the Haitians who risk their lives in small boats to escape their im­poverished homeland. 
James Tobin, winner of the 1981 Nobel prize for eco­nomics, said market forces alone could not reverse the trend. 
"If I get in my car and drive ... from New Haven to New York, and pour the pollutants that come from internal combustion engines into the air, nothing in the price of gasoline or the price of a car deters me from doing that or assesses on me the cost that I am imposing on other people, other drivers or the world ...,"he said.

Man convicted for exposing woman to AIDS 
HOUMA, La. (AP) -A man was convicted Wednesday of violating a state law that makes it a crime to intentionally ex­pose anyone to the AIDS virus. 
Salvadore Gambarella, 28, was accused of exposing his former girlfriend and their child by having sex with her without telling her he was infected. 
Gambarella testified that he told Darla Trosclair that he car­ried the HIV virus; Trosclair said he never told her. 
Trosclair has tested positive for the HIV virus. Their child has not. 
Neither Gambarella or 
Trosclair commented after the jury's verdict in state district court. The trial dealt with one charge involving Trosclair; a second trial is planned for a second charge involving the child.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Today, think about giving 'cold turkey' a try 
Dear Editor: 
As many of you entered the dining hall today, you may have noted-some to your great dismay that "cold turkey' is for lunch. Cold turkey? Is there a new labeling system in the works? I mean, isn't the turkey always cold? What will be next? "Cold" peas? "Cold" meatless baked ziti? 
Not to fear, trusted reader, the dining hall is not experimenting with a new labeling system but mer.ely allying with the Notre Dame chapter of the American Cancer Society to make a point: ;roday-Thurday, Nov. 19,1992 is the American Cancer Society's Great American Smokeout-a day in which all smokers are invited-yes, even challenged-to try to give up smoking for twenty-four hours. 
What's that? You've never heard of the Great American Smokeout? Where have you been? South Bend? 
The Great American Smoke­out is an event which is held on the third Thursday in Novem­ber-yes, a date occurring more often, and more eagerly anticipated than the first Tues­day in November of every fourth year (election day, for those of you still in "South Bend"). 
The Great American Smoke­out-as it is known today-was originally founded in 1977, but its roots reach as far back as 1971-to the birth of the senior class, and to a day when Arthur 
P. Mullaney-a resident of Randolph, Massachusetts-ran a successful campaign to fund a scholarship fund for Randolph High School students. 
Mullaney raised the scholar­ship money by challenging the smokers of the town to donate the money which they would have spent on cigarretes-for that one day-to the fund. 
From these humble begin­nings, the Great American 
Smokeout has spread its roots across America, challenging all people to quit smoking for a day. 
One day? Is that it? 
Yes, smokers, the American Cancer Society challenges you to give up smoking-to go cold turkey-for one day. Today. 
And, for those "purist" non­smokers, do not think that you go unchallenged. We invite you to encourage a friend, an ac­quaintance, and yes-as you do attend a Christian school-even an adversary to beat his or her addiction. 
So, you're wondering why the challenge is only for one day? 
Well, aside from the fact that-believe it or not-the dining hall could run out of cold turkey, the American Cancer Society believes that if smokers quit for one day, they may quit for a lifetime. 
I recognize that this is an ed­ucated reading audience, and that not all smokers want to

quit. 
Therefore, I will not print the plethora of effects that smoking has on everybody's life. I will tell you, though, that the goal of the 1992 Great American Smokeout is to help 25% of smokers give up cigarettes for 24 hours. 
So, now that we've introduced you to the Cancer Society's challenge, the ball is in your hands. 
Kick back, turn on the radio, and let Doing the Butt take on new meaning for you as you squash your butts out-for 24 hours. An intended joke? Close, but no cigar! 
If you didn't know that today is National Smokeout Day, then let your 24 hours begin now. And, by the way, enjoy your cold turkey sandwich.

ND for the Homeless f) 
'New homeless' are different from 'old' 
Editor's note: The following article comes from Out of Shelter, a book about the homeless by Peter Rossi. 
It is important to summarize what has been learned about homelessness from the social research of the past several years before examining what that knowledge implies about possible solutions. 
The following points deserve recapitulation: 
-The old homeless were concentrated in a few segre­gated districts in the large ci­ties. The new homeless tend to be dispersed more widely over the urban landscape, making extreme poverty and home­lessness far more visible. 
The new homeless are strikingly worse off than the old homeless. However inadequate the old cubicle hotels may have been, they still provided a modicum of shelter. A majority of the new homeless are com­pletely without shelter, and the remainder are provided shelter in unsatisfactory dormitory ac­commodations. 
Urban housing markets have been stripped of inexpensive housing, especially for unattached persons and for re­cently formed poor households. While much has been done to provide refurbished downtown housing for young urban pro­fessionals, little or nothing is provided for the young urban poor. Furthermore, however poor the old homeless may have been. their income levels were several magnitudes above those of the new homeless (in constant dollars). 
-The old homeless were al­most all unattached men; many were old men at the end of their working lives. The prospects for rehabilitation, for many, were slight. In contrast, the new homeless include a large contingent of women, many with their children. 
Also, the new homeless are composed largely of younger persons who would ordinarily be employed full time. The prospects of reestablishing tra­
. ditional life-course trajectories appear to be better for some of the new homeless than they would have been for the old. -The old homeless had a niche within the social ecology of the labor market, furnishing labor for seasonal activities or for short-term, low-skilled jobs. The market for such jobs has shrunk considerably with the 
advent of new technologies. The new homeless-unskilled and often disabled-have little or no function to play in today's urban labor market. 
-The old homeless were primarily whites. In contrast, the new homeless are drawn heavily from minority groups. In cities with high proportions of blacks, the homeless are overwhelmingly black. In other cities with large Hispanic or American Indian minorities, these groups constitute major portions of the homeless. 
The characteristics of the new homeless elicit more sympathy, perhaps, than the "old men drunk and sober" of the Skid Rows of the past. It is more arresting and disturbing to see homeless persons dotted all over the downtown urban landscape than to have them concentrated in readily avoid­able areas of the city, and even more disturbing when some of the ragged and dirty are women and men in what are considered their prime years. 
The new homeless serve as reminders that the social wel­fare safety nets begun during . the Great Depression and sig­nificantly augmented in the 1960's are failing to prevent extreme destitution among an increasingly large portion of the American population. 
The failure of the welfare sys­tem to cover those who are vulnerable to homelessness is a long-standing fault of a system that essentially ignores the in­come-support problems faced by unattached adults. The Reagan administration has not succeeded in dismantling any significant portion of the net, but has made the mesh so coarse and weak that many fall through and hit bottom. Those who are disabled by the handi­caps of minority status, chronic mental illness, physical illness, or substance abuse are espe­cially vulnerable. 
The social welfare system has never been very attentive to unattached men, but now it ap­pears to be as unresponsive to unattached females. The slow erosion of the safety net has left gaps in the system through which have fallen the men and women of the streets, the shelters, and the welfare hotels. 
Likewise, the social welfare system does little to help fami­lies support their dependent adult members. Many of the old homeless, those of the 1950's and early 1960's, were pushed out or thrown away by their families when they passed the peak of adulthood, having reached age fifty or sixty. 
Many of the new homeless are products of a similar process, but one that begins at age twenty-five or thirty. With their disabilities, they have ex­hausted the patience and re­sources of relatives and friends no longer willing or able to support them. 
As a result, homelessness now looms large on our political agenda, and there is much concern about what can be done. I have suggested a number of measures that might be taken to reduce homelessness to a more ac­ceptable level. These include: 
-compensating for the fail­ures of our housing market by fostering the retention and en­largement of our urban low-in­come housing stock, especially housing appropriate for unattached persons; 
-reversing the policy of the last two decades that has put personal choice above institu­tionalization for those so severely disabled that they are unable to make choices that will preserve their lives and physical well-being; 
-enlarging the concept of disability to include conditions no.t purely physical in character, and in particular, recognizing chronic mental illness and chronic alcoholism for the pro­found disabilities that they are; 
-restoring the real value of welfare payments to levels above bare subsistence, to the purchasing power of the late 1960's; and 
-extending welfare benefits to unattached adults who are not senior citizens and the households that provide them with shelter and support. 
There is considerable public support in the United States for a social welfare system that guarantees a minimally decent standard of living to all. Homelessness on the scale cur­rently being experienced is clear evidence that such a sys­tem is not yet in place. 
That the current level of na­tional prosperity is literally without historic parallel is like­wise clear evidence that some­thing can be done about the problem if the national will is there. I have tried to stress that public policy decisions have in large measure created the problem of homelessness. They can solve the problem as well.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Policy demands Osco boycott Honor Code should be 
extended to dining hall
Dear Editor: 
I am writing this letter in re­sponse to an incident which oc­curred Monday night at the Osco Drugs in University Park Mall. It takes a great deal of abuse to get me angry, but I got this and more from a manager there, and instead of letting him have it, I decided to take all of this positive energy and do something useful with it. 
The incident in question took place when, after shopping with my girlfriend, I decided to grab some beer for a "social gathering" before the Def Lep­pard concert, as I had a few friends coming over for the show. 
I got a case of the old standby, plopped my driver's license down on the counter (I am 21, of course) and prepared to pay for it when the saleslady informed me in an apologetic voice "I'm sorry, but I can't ac­cept an out of state driver's li­cense." Huh? I knew people had very little respect for Al­abama, which is where I hail from, but I also knew Indiana had no room to criticize. 
In addition, I had purchased beer from this particular store before. Thinking that she had doubts as to whether I was the guy on the license, I asked her if she would accept another 
Dear Editor: 
I am writing in response to the letter written by Ted Stephan (The Observer Nov. 9, 1992) and to all those who share his opinion that the abortion issue is a single issue and that those with strong convictions regarding the issue are extremists. 
The abortion issue is not just another in a myriad of issues concerning the people of this nation; it certainly should not be for a true Christian. If to be Christian means to imitate Christ, than we as Christians are called to spread the gospel messages. "Love God. Love your neighbor. Die to self. Take up your cross and follow me." 
The gospel message is full of instructions on how a follower can attain eternal life in the glory of Heaven. I do not recall ever having read statements from Jesus instructing His fol­lowers on how to better their economy so that they could have more things in this world. 
In fact, it seems to me that Jesus, born in a manger, lived most of his life as a humble carpenter (not a lucrative busi­ness to my knowledge). If, per­chance, he did make 'oodles' of money, He left it all when He became a mendicant preacher for the last three years of his life. 
He wanted to teach people to become rich in love for God, and by being so, rich in love for their neighbor. Then, when the form of ID. I had two credit cards, a gas card, my student ID and my social security card, all among the life membership cards for bars that I had tucked away in my wallet. She didn't think so but was nice enough to get the manager in charge of the policy to make sure. 
When I began asking this gentleman about secondary forms of ID, I was interrupted with a curt "NO!" which was then followed by a terse, hostile explanation about this gentle­man being "burned too may times" and "having to protect his liquor license," the result of which was stated as "I will not sell to a Notre Dame student who does not have an Indiana State driver's license." 
My observation that the vast majority of students at Notre Dame are not from Indiana was ignored as irrelevant. This manager's attitude and manner were extremely disrespectful, rude, and antagonistic, the most so that I have ever en­countered in a vendor. Even the saleslady who had called him looked perturbed. 
What it boils down to is this: Osco Drugs of U.P. Mall appar­ently has a prohibition against the purchase of alcohol by a person without an Indiana state driver's license in general, and a prohibition against the pur­
truth of his message incensed the people of his country so much as to deliver Him up to be crucified, He, God's own Son, humbled Himself to save us. He suffered abandonment by His closest friends, calumny from His enemies, injury from those who flogged, spit, and crucified Him, humiliation by those who stripped Him in public and mocked Him, and the torment of seeing those who loved Him, especially His own mother, weep for Him. This is who we profess to follow. Do we really try to imitate Christ or are we just historians who trust the man existed .and know His story. 
If we are Christians, people truly trying to imitate Christ and follow His teachings, than we must make abortion, or rather the butchering ofde­fenseless, voiceless, innocent babies (for that is the gruesome reality of abortion) the central issue in our life. 
To sacrifice all, not to mention a little inconvenience or ridicule, to save one life is to be Christian. To try to dissuade a distraught mother from murdering her own flesh and blood, God's own creation developing within her, is to love her and save her from com­mitting a grave sin. 
It is our obligation as Chris­tians. It is not being extremist, unless by that you mean loving to the extreme. "Whatsoever you do to the least of my people, chase of alcohol by Notre Dame students of legal age who hap­pen to come from another state in particular. 
Regardless of the dubious le­gality of such a mandate, the information was imparted to me in an inappropriate, em­barrassing, and ultimately unacceptable fashion. 
I very much received the im­pression that this new policy was focused towards Notre Dame students, and though I am aware that, being a college student, businesses will often give me the run-around, I was offended and angered enough to take action in a way that hopefully will change their atti­tude towards Notre Dame stu­dents. 
I am asking Notre Dame stu­dents, as a community, to stop shopping at Osco Drugs of U.P. Mall, until it reevaluates its po­sition towards us. We represent a substantial portion of their income, and if they think they can take us for granted, they are certainly in for a surprise. 
Even if my plea falls on deaf ears, I know one thing: Osco Drugs has lost this customer permanently. 
Joe Hill Grace Hall Nov. 16, 1992 
that you do unto me." These are the words of our Christ-don't they mean anything? 
I submit that they are a charge for each person who cLaims to be Christian to see Christ in everyone-the poor person on the street, the lonely nerd down the hall, the head­banging junkie, the pregnant teenager, the disappointed parents, and the innocent child developing in what should be the protection of his own mother's womb. If I love these people, I will do whatever pos­sible to see that they can know the joy and peace of dying to personal power, wealth, and desires, and living for God. 
Our nation allows the legal dismembering of babies. Every day for close to twenty-years an average of 4,400 babies are murdered. Why is it that this news no longer horrifies every Christian? This is only the ba­bies killed. The babies are the lucky ones. They suffer a cruel death, but they are blameless. 
We, on the other hand, must answer for our ability to con­tinue living comfortable lives of apathy while our progeny are massacred daily. Each Christian who does not actively oppose the slaughter of the innocence and consider this a central issue must examine if he is really living out the Christian message. 
Alicia Scheidler Knott Hall Nov. 15, 1992 



Dear Editor: 
Why is it that we, as students at the University of Notre Dame, can be trusted to take a test in a large lecture hall, sit­ting shoulder to shoulder with other students, without cheat­ing and yet need to be proc­tored as we leave the dining hall for fear that we have taken an extra piece of food? 
The rules about taking food out of the dining hall say that only one piece of fruit and one piece of pastry are allowed out with each person. Why so stringent? We all paid for the food that we eat and few if any­one would ever try to take armfuls of food back to their dorm with them. If taking too much food out of the dining hall is such a problem, the best so­lution might be to extend the honor code to the amount of food that is taken out of the dining hall. 
Just as most students are scared to death of being put on trial or expelled for cheating on a test, most would probably be embarrassed to be caught taking too much food out of the dining hall without good reason. The honor code is based on the assumption that people are inherently good. Since the University seems to believe this theory, they should extend their beliefs to the University Food Services rather than allowing themselves to seem hypocritical. 
To justify the need for some people to take extra food out of the dining hall occasionally, the.re are situations in which this is necessary and should be readily acceptable. For exam­
. pie, someone who may be too ill to go to the dining hall to eat may need to ask his/her roommate to bring him/her back something to eat. With the rules that exist, it would be nearly impossible for the ill person to eat anything comparable to the meal he/she is entitled to without spending any money. There is no reason for that person to have to spend money by asking someone to go to LaFortune to buy him/her something to eat or by ordering a pizza. The person paid for each of his/her meals and should not be deprived of one because of the misfortune of 
Dear Editor: 
The Neighborhood Study Help Program would like to thank the ·Notre Dame Men's Basketball Team, the coaches, and all those who helped to or­ganize the Blue and Gold game which was played last Wednes­day evening. 
The game was a wonderful opportunity for many South Bend schoolchildren to spend illness. 
There are also times when one may need to go somewhere or be too busy to sit down in the dining hall in order to eat. In such cases as well, one should be able to pass through the dining hall and grab something that he/she can eat later or on his/her way somewhere or be able to send a friend to do them such a favor. Is it wrong to believe in take-out? 
Of course most people would probably rather sit down at a table to eat a meal with friends and take a study break, how­ever sometimes it just isn't pos­sible and one may need the convenience of being able to take his/her meal with him/her. 
In addition, a consideration that should be made in regard to taking food out of the dining hall, even when taking enough to constitute a meal out isn't necessary, is the type of food that is allowed out. Why do the rules specifically state that the food that may be taken out ap­plies only to fruit and pastry, all other food excluded? 
Obviously, no one is going to attempt to take a plate of spaghetti or a salad back to his/her dorm room. However, there should be nothing wrong with taking out a slice of bread, a sandwich, or other reasonably transportable article of food, especially in such cases as mentioned above. 
To extend the honor code to include the dining hall would simply require an agreement to only take two pieces of food (rather than specifically fruit and pastry) out of the dining hall, unless there is reason to do otherwise, in which case what is taken out constitutes his/her meal or that of another student. 
The dining hall could even reserve the right to question a student who seems to be taking advantage of their trust or to ask for the identification of the student whom a meal is being procured for. However, to ex­tend the honor code to the Uni­versity Food Services would establish a better consistency in the University's practice of trust.

Keepin 
the faith 
Communities ND brings students together to gain abetter understanding of faith in their lives 
By MATT CARBONE 
Accent Writer 
Notre Dame has always been known as a place that nurtures and strengthens a person's religious faith. Now, through the efforts of Campus Ministry, there is an additional means by which to do this -Communities ND. 
Communities ND is a new program developed by Campus Ministry in which "small Christian communities" of ten undergraduates meet for prayer, Bible study, and discussion of issues facing adult Christians in the modern world. 
The purpose of these small faith groups, according to Kate Barrett, a staff member of Campus Ministry and one of the program's founders, is to "integrate students' faith into what it means to be an adult, and to get students talking about things they otherwise wouldn't talk about." 
Barrett and others in Campus Ministry have been designing and honing the program since the second semester of last year. 
Every two weeks, the group will meet in the dorm of one of its members. There will be a reading and discussion of the upcoming Sunday's Gospel, followed by a discussion of a topic concerning Christianity and worship in the present day. 
Each group will be comprised solely of students, both male and female. The only basis that will be used for the formation of the groups will be at what times during the week each student is free, as indicated on the student's communities will energize people to service." 

McDermott says that students have been looking for ways to come to a better understanding of their faith, and for ways to integrate this faith in their lives. He noticed a need for a program like Communities ND at the retreats held for graduating seniors. 
"Again and again, I saw these graduates coming out of the retreats saying, "I wished I'd talked about these things sooner,"' says McDermott. Through Communities ND, Campus Ministry hopes to remedy this situation by getting students talking about their faith in the earlier years of their academic careers. 
Ideally, the faith groups would be formed in undergraduates' freshman years, and would be kept together for all four years of the members' time at ND. This year, however, sophomore and juniors, as well as freshman, will be allowed into the program. 
For those interested in joining the program, sign-up forms will be available after Thanksgiving break in both the Badin Hall and Hesburgh Library offices of Campus Ministry.

Students interpret Shakespeare's work through performance 
By KENYA JOHNSON 
Assistant Accent Editor 
"There is something rotten in the state of Denmark." 
Students across the country would have no problems iden­tifying this famous quote from Shakespeare's "Hamlet," but few would understand it as well as the Notre Dame students in Professor Paul Rathburn's class, Shakespearean Performances. 
The class is listed as an English course, but there is also a fair amount of performing which takes place in the class. 
"Traditionally there's been a conflict existing between the­ater direction and literary cri­tique," said Rathburn. The merging of the two different, almost conflicting perspectives is what makes the course so intriguing, according to Rathburn. 
proaches to Shakespeare on the other hand," he said. 
The students are asked to study the meter and verse of a line as well as the stage directions, which are imbedded in the text. Essentially, to fulfill both literary and theatrical ap­proaches, the students must read closely and understand the text completely. 
Junior Laura Niemann said she didn't really know what to expect from the class. 
"It really is so much more intense than other literature classes because of the theatrics," said Niemann. "I thought actually the class might be rather dry, but it's far from it." 
Characters must be thoroughly researched in order to do a complete job. "To act out Benedict in just one scene of Act III of 'Much To Do About Nothing,' the student must derstand the whole Benedict character in order to portray him successfully." 
In the course, Rathburn stresses that plays are much more than documents or a history of ideas. 
"The plays were not intended to be read quietly," he ex­plained. "Shakespeare wrote his works to be performed." 
"If you just look at a musical score by Beethoven, all you would see is notes. You don't have a symphony until it's performed, just as you don't have a Shakespeare play until it's performed," said Rathburn. 
Shakespeare works depend upon the interaction of the text, the actor, and the audience, all of which are present in Rath­burn's classroom. 
Students are judged not on their acting ability, but rather on their reasoning for the way the play, according to Rathburn. 

Rathburn is not the only cru­sader on this literary quest. Mrs. Carol MacLeod, wife of Notre Dame basketball coach John MacLeod, teaches the students various acting and directing maneuvers that will help express clear, effective scenes. 
MacLeod is a New York actress and has recently founded an acting theater. 
"I can't say enough about his class," said senior Jeanne Blasi. "We learn how the scenes really work. It's also neat to work 
Shakespearean Performance is a recently established course resulting from a Lilly ­Foundation Grant. The class began in the 1988-1989 academic year and has by far been the "most dynamic" class, according to Rathburn. 
Correction: 
An Accent article in Wednesday's Observer mistakenly referred to Phil Collen as the new member of Def Leppard. The 
"The class attempts to create a marriage between theatrical approaches to Shakespeare on one hand and literary ap­know everything about Benedict," explained Rathburn. "Just reading the scene would not be enough. You must un­

Temple fires Berndt 
PHILADELPHIA (AP) Temple University officially ousted coach Jerry Berndt Wednesday, just before the end of his fourth year in a five-year contract. 
The firing is effective after the game Saturday against Rutgers, Temple president Peter Liacouras said in a statement. 
Berndt could not be imme­diately reached for comment. 
Liacouras said the university would pay for Berndt's final year from private donations, not public funds. He did not say when a successor would be named. 
Liacouras said the decision was made in a meeting Wednesday night with athletic director Charles Theokas and executive vice president Jack Freeman. 
"A change in personnel is always painful for everyone involved," Liacouras said. "It is even more difficult when the person is an honorable and decent as Jerry Berndt." 
Temple officials allowed rumors to grow over the past week as school officials con­firmed Clemson assistant Ron Dickerson had interviewed for the job. 
And in Miami last weekend, the Owls had to deal with distracting rumors about their coach's job instead of a game-of-a­lifetime test against the top­ranked Hurricanes. Temple lost 48-0.

However, as much as he would like to remain out of the spotlight, Ling might have a difficult time doing it if he con­tinues to produce points at his pace. The Irish look forward to Ling's production and hope that his contributions continue throughout the next four years.

Gibbs was not immediately available for comment. It was

that had been brewing for sev­eral weeks. 
"I .think a lot of people don't believe the right things are being done for us to win," lineman Joe Correia said after Gundy left. 

He said he and others were upset that Collins did not play against Oklahoma State. He said Gundy at one point during the OSU game asked coaches to insert Collins because he had hurt his leg. 
"I just don't understand it unless it's a personal vendetta against Steve," Correia said. 
He added later, "We need to win at all costs. They (the coaches) were saying 'we want the best players on the field at all times and that's our job to do that.' It's a contradiction to me. If you go back and watch the Oklahoma State film ... Cale will tell you himself that he wasn't the best player for that situation." 

Linebacker Reggie Barnes, who like Gundy, is a captain, said "the things that were said were said for the betterment of this football team, not to cause any heartache or problems."

Most players refused to comment as they left the meeting, although those who did comment said it had nothing to do with the quarterbacks. 
Gundy bolted through re­porters and said, "There's no problems, no problems at all." 
Later, Gundy returned and said the meeting had nothing to dq with any controversy involv­
ing him and Collins. 
"Steve and I have probably become better friends than anybody on this team," Gundy said. "We're not walking out. We're not going to quit as a team. We just called a meeting so we could talk as a team with all the coaches and all the play­ers together. We've been doing all of our talking on our own, by ourselves, with certain coaches and certain players, but not as a team." 
Directing his comments at the media, Gundy said, "Y'all people don't try to ruin this team. We've got a great team here and we've got a lot of fam­ily."

Indiana win highlights first night of preseason NIT 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP)­Indiana ran its motion offense but the easiest points came when the Hoosiers were stand­ing still. 
Greg Graham scored 22 points Wednesday night and No. 4 Indiana used some deadly free throw shooting for a 103­80 victory over Murray State in the first round of the preseason NIT. 
"I guess we concentrate more on free throws," Graham said. "I mean ... free throws are free throws. That's whay they call them free throws." 
The Hoosiers. (1-0) took a 53­36 lead at halftime and led by as many as 27 points as the Racers {0-1} repeatedly sent Indiana to the foul line. The Hoosiers hit 37 of 42 attempts, including 12 of 13 by Graham. Murray State made 15 of 21 free throws. 
"The main thing is to con­centrate," Graham said. "Free throws are really going to be important for us, because those are easy points. You're not go­ing to get any easier points than free throws." 
The victory sent Indiana into the second round of the tour-

''I'm calling his mother tonight, his uncle too," teased Deane, who said Sura, of Wilkes Barre, Pa., made the right decision to play in the basketball-rich Atlantic Coast Conference. "He belongs at this level."

"With guards like that, you go to them because they can answer," Florida State coach Pat Kennedy said. "They're both just great guards." 
Cassell had nine assists filling in for Charlie Ward at point guard for the Seminoles (1-0), who remain at home for a Friday night quarterfinal game against Iowa State. Florida State hit 19 of 26 shots in the second half and shot 60 percent. The 6-foot-5 Sura, last year's conference rookie of the year, made eight of 11 shots, including all four of Florida State's 3-pointers.

AMES, Iowa (AP) -Julius Michalik scored a career-high 24 points and helped No. 19 Iowa State pull away in the sec­ond half for the victory over Indiana State in preseason action. 
Iowa State won its fourth straight season opener and will play at No. 9 Florida State in a second-round game on Friday night. 
Justus Thigpen added 19 points for Iowa State, which was ragged at times despite returning all five starters from last season's 21-13 team. The Cyclones were leading only 37­34 early in the second half when Michalik got them going. 
The 6-foot-11 sophomore scored on a drive to start a 21-4 run that stretched the lead to 58-38. Michalik, whose previ­ous best was 23 points against Loyola-Chicago last year, had 11 points in that seven-minute stretch and also handed out two assists. 
It was never in doubt after that. The Cyclones began run-

NEW ORLEANS -Tulane had the opening-night jitters, but shook them off to beat Wagner Wednesday night in opening round action. 
"For the first time out of the box, I think the kids did a good job," Tulane coach Perry Clark said. "The kids came out well. They were a little flustered at times, but it was a good win for us. They (Wagner) are going to win 20 games this year. This win is going to help our power rating later in the season." 
Anthony Reed scored 20 points -six in the first three minutes of the game -as No. 17 Tulane rolled early over persistent Wagner. 
Tulane will face Indiana in the second round Friday night at Bloomington, Ind. 
Valvano set to return 
(AP)-Five months after being diagnosed with cancer, Jim Valvano returns to work Friday night to broadcast the quarterfinals of the preseason NIT on ESPN. 
"I feel pretty strong and I'm looking forward to getting back to work," Valvano said in a telephone conference call Wednesday. "When my eyes open each day and my feet touch the floor, I thank God for the day I have and say 'let's go get 
Valvano takes treatment for his cancer every two weeks as an outpatient at Duke University Medical Center and every six weeks he spends two or three days in the hospital where he is treated with chemotherapy. "I fight every day and it's an every day battle," he said. "Every day you get up and thank God for the day you have." 
Last June, the ex-North Carolina State coach was diagnosed with metastatic adenocarcinoma, a cancer that can start in an organ or in glands and spread throughout the body. "When I found out, my reaction was not anger, it was incredulity," Valvano said. 
"My reaction was, 'Run that test again.' It was incomprehensible, followed by helplessness. I was no longer in control. I had always felt in control over my destiny and dignity. Being a cancer patient, you don't feel that control." 
Valvano said he has pain in his lower back, hips and knees caused by the cancer. The chemotherapy treatment 
causes numbness in his hands and feet and ringing in his ears. He has not experienced the baldness that usually occurs. 
"I have the toughest hair in the country," he said. "It's a medical miracle."

Tovar has no regrets about OSU 
COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) ­Over his career at Ohio State, Steve Tovar has been force-fed the headlines about Michigan's success, Michigan's champi­onships, Michigan's bowl trips. 
Still, he admits to no regrets about a change of heart four years ago the caused him to sign with Ohio State instead of Michigan. 
As he gets ready to face a Michigan team for the final time Saturday, Tovar is hoping to gain a small portion of vindi­cation for the decision he made while a senior in high school. 
"Pride is the biggest thing," he said. 
His decision has cost him four Big Ten Conference championship rings and three trips to the Rose Bowl. Yet the two-time, first-team all-confer­ence linebacker has no regrets, at least none that he'll admit to publicly. 
"I think there's a lot of in­tangible things that rings or ti­tles can't describe," Tovar said. 
When the sixth-ranked Wolverines play the 17th­ranked Buckeyes, Tovar will again be staring at everything he missed. He has yet to play on a team that has beaten the Wolverines, who have won the last four meetings. He has yet to be on a winning team in a bowl game.

"It (last season) helped a lot," Phonz commented. "I became accustomed to doing a lot of the things we are doing now. Defensively, we have to help each other out a lot, and we played that way last season (at Notre Dame)." 
The familiarity with the style of play in the NBA was rein­forced by his participation at the Nuggets' entire training camp. 
"I couldn't have done what I have without having gone through the entire training camp," Ellis said. 
Ellis was able to get this time in camp, which most rookies do not get due to contract disputes, because he and the Nuggets agreed to a five year deal worth over $12 million in the summer. Whereas the second pick in the draft Alonzo Mourning signed a week into the regular season, and Jimmy Jackson, the fourth pick, still has not signed with the Dallas Mavericks. 
One thing that has changed in Ellis' life is the location of his family. Since getting married after graduation, Ellis, his wife Jennifer and their
-daughter Alexis have moved to an apartment in Denver, where they are "house hunt­ing,"according to Ellis. 
Though individual success and a new family would have most high-paid athletes con­tent, the Nuggets' losing and his constant desire to improve have Phonz as determined as ever. 
"You can never be satisfied with the way you're playing, especially when your not win­ning," Ellis explained. 
Butkus Award candidate said he doesn't dwell on such things. 
"I chose a school based on the people I liked, not only the players but the coaches and the program that was heading in the right direction," said the Elyria native. ''I'll never resent not going to Michigan and com­ing here because I've had a lot of success and made a lot of friends. 
"I think I could've played at Michigan or another school. But this is where I'm happy and I wouldn't take it back for anything." 
Tovar has thrived at Ohio State. He is in his third straight year of leading Ohio State in tackles, with 113 so far. He also has nine tackles for losses, two sacks, has blocked two kicks and has forced two fumbles. 
His coach, John Cooper, calls him the best defensive player he has ever had during a 31­
r 
year coaching career. 
But always there has been the shadow of Michigan's ac­complishments and of what might have been. 
"When I was younger, I had a little resentment," he said. "As I got older, it's more of a pride factor. You just want to beat them after a while. It's not a revenge factor; I just flat-out want to win one." 
Both teams already know where they're headed for the holidays: Michigan to the Rose Bowl and Ohio State to the Florida Citrus Bowl. 
All year long, Tovar was aware of Michigan's status in the national rankings and or its succession of great players and great victories.

Godfrey perfect choice as Irish swim C<?·Captain 
By ERIK JOHNSON Sports Writer 
The world of swimming is a wet and lonely one, especially at 6 A.M. on a snowy, windy, January morning. Many swimmers get tired of this sport, which involves swimming back and forth in a pool of chlorinated water and getting nowhere. after 6 or 7 years. 
One would think that after 16 years of competitive swimming, John Godfrey would have been ready to hang up his goggles years ago. He hasn't even thought of it. Godfrey states that he "liked it [swimming] all along." 
Godfrey's longest break in the last 16 years has been three months, and that occurred last semester. His hard 'work and love for the sport of swimming were contributing factors to Godfrey's being vot~d co­captain of this year's Notre Dame men's swimming team. 
Godfrey began swimming at the age of six. He really came into his own four years later, when he competed in the 10 and under age group. It was in this age group that Godfrey achieved times which put him into consideration for a national ranking. However, his time that year was not good enough to place him among the country's elite. As Godfrey aged, his swimming improved. At the age of 14, Godfrey achieved a national ranking of 13 in the 200 meter backstroke. 
When Godfrey at Notre Dame as a freshman recruit from Kentucky, he did not know what to expect from college swimming. Tired of the sport and plagued by injury, Godfrey still swam for the Irish. Swimming had to take a back­seat to academics. Schoolwork was Godfrey's main objective that year. He states, "My only real goal coming to Notre Dame was to do well in school. [I worked] hard to do the best that I could in swimming ... my main goal was to go to school." 
His 12 years of prior swim-

ming, and a family history of successful swimmers would not let him neglect his swimming. Godfrey admits that the competition with his brothers helped him in swimming, but he never swims to beat their records or achievements. "Everyone is unique in their own respect," Godfrey states. "Their [his brothers'] glory , we didn't try to take it away." 
Being voted captain was a continuation of a family tradi­tion. One older brother cap­tained a Kentucky men's swimming team, and most re­cently, his brother Paul cap­tained the 1990-1991 Notre Dame team. Godfrey some­times asks them for advice in a difficult situation, but Godfrey has a style of leadership strictly his own. He does not yell to rally his troops, but rather God­frey wishes to lead merely by example. He explains, "I try to lead by example... [by] doing well in the workouts." 
The Irish co-captain feels fortunate just to be a part of possibly the most successful swimming class ever to swim for the University. The class of 1993 holds the majority of the Notre Dame swimming records. Godfrey thinks that no previous class has controlled the outcome of the meets like the current class. 
"During our four years, we've been leaders in the pool.They've [the other classes] had some swimmers better than we are, but not as many [swimmers] on our level," contends Godfrey. Godfrey is not only thankful for his swimming, but also for the ex­periences he has gained over the last four years. 
Swimmers are a group of people who stick together and form life-long bonds. He feels fortunate to have formed these bonds. "The friendships that swimmers have...it is one thing that I will have for the rest of my life, I will carry it with me," commented Godfrey. 
Godfrey, like almost all swimmers, has one goal left-the NCAA meet. Godfrey admits that he has been thinking about qualifying for the NCAAs since he entered college. 
Although he has not achieved this goal yet, when he looks back over his college career, Godfrey sees nothing but satis­faction. "It has been very much worth it, and hopefully I'll still have some good times to come." 
Bonds wins 2nd MVP in last three years 
NEW YORK (AP) -Barry Bonds' value as a free agent went up a little Wednesday after he was named the Na­tional League Most Valuable Player for the second time in three years. 
Bonds was an easy winner over Atlanta's Terry Pendleton, receiving 18 of a possible 24 first-place votes in balloting by the Baseball Writers Associa­tion of America. Bonds finished with 304 points, followed by Pendleton with 232 points, in­cluding four first-place votes, and San Diego's Gary Sheffield with two first-place votes and 204 points. 
'I think this is probably the most important one because 
this one I'm giving to my mom. She deserves it," Bonds said of his second MVP award. 
Bonds, the son of former ma­jor leaguer Bobby Bonds, led the Pittsburgh Pirates to their third straight NL East title by hitting .311 with 34 homers and 103 RBis. He also scored 109 runs and walked 127 times. 
The left fielder also won the MVP award in 1990 and was runner-up to Pendleton last year. He is the 1Oth player to win more than one NL MVP, joining such Hall of Famers as Stan Musial, Willie Mays and Ernie Banks. 
"I have a lot or reactions," Bonds said. "Last year, statisti­cally I thought I had a shot. I was very happy for Terry Pendleton. He's a good friend of mine." 
For winning MVP honors, Bonds gets a $250,000 bonus from the Pirates. That raised his 1992 income to $5.05 mil­lion, including bonuses. 
"I never set goals for my­self," Bonds said. "I prepare the same way every year. I would do the same things if you paid me one dollar." 
The difference this winter is that Bonds is preparing to play for a new team in 1993. The All-Star outfielder will be a looking for a contract that pays him at least $7 million per season, and it's very unlikely the Pirates can afford it. 
"I haven't closed the door to anything," Bonds said. "I don't really want to get involved in the negotiations. My agent will let me know what's going on." 
The teams most interested in Bonds are the New York Yankees and Atlanta Braves. During the NL playoffs, Bonds went house hunting in the At­lanta area. 
"Maybe by next week things will be a little clearer," said Dennis Gilbert, Bonds' agent. "We've talked to a lot of teams. We've narrowed it down to five teams." 
Gilbert declined to discuss any figures. 
Bonds has emerged as one of the best players in the major leagues because of his all­around abilities. 
"I want to do it again," Bonds said of the MVP award. ''I'm 28. I want to be the first to I I it four times."

Holmes, Snyder Saint Mary's Twin Towers 
By KILEY COBLE Sports Writer 
Belles basketball fans will be able to see their version of the Twin Towers perform on the court together this year. 
Last year, seniors Julie Snyder and Kim Holmes both played center, so they played different times on the court. This year, however, Holmes is playing lead forward and will play the same time Snyder does, who retained her center spot. 
Holmes has no problems in changing positions this year. "I played forward in high school and liked it, I'm happy just to play," noted Holmes. 
These two players are used to spending time together, as they 
Riley paces Irish sophomore class 
By BRIAN KUBICKI Sports Writer 
The women's cross-country team had big expectations for its 13 freshman last season. There was no question they were going to be good, the question was who would be the best. 
Sarah Riley in her sophomore year has emerged as the best in that talented class, and the best for the team this season as well. 
After running solidly as a freshman but placing consis­tently behind classmates Eva Flood and Stefanie Jensen, Ri­ley established herself early this season, pacing an Irish victory at the National Catholic Championships by taking the individual title. ­
"All of us are so close to­gether, I just happened to be the one {who led the team)," explained Riley of this season's leadership on the course. De­spite this close competition from her teammates, she was are both roommates and best friends. "People ask us if we get sick of each other," Snyder said. "We even have to guard each other during practice, but I never get sick of Kim." Holmes said that it is not a problem doing everything to­gether with Snyder, because the two are so laid back about things. 
The Twin Towers and the rest of the team did not look laid back yesterday afternoon, as they smashed Bethel College in a practice scrimmage, 105-50. Snyder and other teammates concede that the whole team this year contributes to the success the Belles are already showing. 
"Because there's no one star, 
the team's top finisher up to the end of the season. 
Riley finished off her season with impressive performances in her two last meets. Her first place finish in the Midwestern Collegiate Conference meet helped bring the team title back to Notre Dame. Then two weeks later at the NCAA District meet, she finished 16th, again pacing the Irish squad which finished in fourth place at the competitive meet. 
Fourth place was not enough for the women to earn a bid to the national meet, a feat which Riley said would have been good to accomplish for the ex­perience. "Next year we hope to be in the top fifteen in nationals and in the top ten my senior year," noted Riley. 
Those seem like lofty expec­tations for a program that was elevated to varsity status only five years ago, but Riley found joining the unestablished team attractive for that reason. "I wanted to make an impact and the team should show a lot less selflessness in play because of combos," said junior Molly Wheeler. 
The Belles have a challenging schedule this year. This week­end begins their season at the Lake Forest College Tourna­ment. "This will be a hard weekend," said Holmes. "All three teams are tough." She also noted that the game against the University of Chicago on January 19, a Divi­sion I school, will be tough. 
Right now, both Holmes and Snyder are just looking forward to their last year playing bas­ketball for Saint Mary's. "The whole team is really together this year," said Snyder. 
it seemed exciting to be a part of a developing program," said Riley. 
She brought with her to South Bend lots of talent and hefty credentials that hinted of the impact she would make. While running for Capolindo High School in Moraga, California, Riley garnered an individual conference title each of her four years and was the state champion her junior year. 
At Notre Dame though, Riley has focused her attention on the team. When asked about individual goals, she responded, "Cross country is a team sport. I really really want us to go to Nationals." 
Riley and her young team­mates have placed themselves on the verge of attaining that goal this season and next sea­son it seems almost certain. All that remains to be answered is whether Sarah Riley will lead them there or if yet another of the talented class of '95 will be the pace-setter.

Long time fans rejoice: The Cowboys are on top 

As a youth, did you own two, maybe three, Tony Dorsett or Danny White jerseys? 
Do names like Billy Joe Dupree, Robert Newhouse, and Ed "Too Tall" Jones bring back the kid in you? 
If the answer is yes, then you may have been like me, one of the millions of followers of America's Team, the Dallas Cowboys. 
Well, I'm here to tell you that the magic is back. 
Yes, despite this weekend's loss to the resurgent Rams, the Cowboys are on top once again-the Cowboys are back in the saddle as America's team. 
Using the results of an informal survey of my dorm and after noticing the recent proliferation of Cowboy hats across campus, I have deducted that none other than the Cowboys are now Notre Dame's most popular football team. 
This is the way it was when we were growing up, when names like those mentioned earlier led the Cowpokes to stellar records every year, and even though they never won a Super Bowl in the eighties, they were the country's most popular team. 
However. after TO's retirement and the fall of the legendary Tom Landry, many fans went away from the grey and blue to follow more successful teams. 
For example, in Chicago, where I'm from, everyone and their brother hopped on the Bears' bandwagon and rode it all the way through their Super Bowl victory in 1986. But I was one of the few stronghearted fans who stuck with my team through thick and thin, through a 1-15 season, and I am now reaping the rewards. 
My hometown Bears and their coach are now an embarrassment to the foot­ball league they belong to, and the Cowboys are on top. In fact, I got to sit back and watch my team knock those Bears out of the playoffs in Chicago last season. 
So if you were one of those guys I talked about, wake up! Break out your Drew Pearson and Tony Hill posters, and enjoy the celebration. Don't feel guilty if you didn't stick with the team through the Gary Hogeboom and Steve Pelluer eras, you can still have fun rooting for the Emmitts, the Aikmans and the lrvins of the current team. 
Last weekend's loss could only be a turning point for Dallas, and possibly a springboard for the Cowboys' first ever 14-2 season. 
Think of it, with your help there may come a day when all of the oldtime Cowboy fans can join together and re­joice as the 'Pokes win a remarkable and unprecedented four straight Super Bowls.
