Dance-a-than begins March 26 
by Cathy Nolan Staff Reporter 

Any frustrated dancer who has ever dreamed of being another Fred Astaire Ol' Ginger Rogers will have the chance to display his talents this weekend at the South Bend Multiple Sclerosis Dance-a­thon. It will be held in the LaFortune Ballroom beginning Fri­day March 26 at 8 p.m., continuing until 6 p.m., Sunday March 28. 
The Dance-a-thon is open to all Notre Dame and St. Mary's stu­dents as well as anyone in the Michiana area. All couples must be sponsored by an organization such as a school or club. An organization may sponsor more than one couple. 
The registration fee per couple is .$5.00. The sponsoring organiza­tion may contribute by making a straight donation or by pledging a certain amount of money per hour. 
Meals for the couples have been donated by various restaurants in the Michiana region, including the Ponderosa Steak House, Dunkin Donuts, Burger King and McDon­ald's. The food will be served to the couples on the dance floor. Couples will be expected to con­tinue dancing while they eat and drink. 
Music will be provided by seve­
ral bands. According to Social 
Commissioner Charlie Noran, the 
commission has already obtained 
three bands and hopes to have at 
least four or five perform through­
out the weekend. WSND will also 
be on hand to broadcast portions of 
the dance and to provide records. 
A prize will be awarded to the 
winning couple. The prize has not 
yet been determined. but will 
probably be a gift certificate. "The 
whole purpose of the dance-a-thon 
is to raise money for multiple 
sclerosis, not to win a prize," 
Moran stated. The couple who has 
collected the most money and is 
still dancing at 6 p.m. on Sunday 
will be designated the winner. 
The participants must observe 
several rules. The couples must 
remain on the dance floor during 
the three-hour dance period. The 
couples are allowed a 20-minute 
break after the three-hour dancing 
period. Violation of these rules will 
result in the couple's disqualifica­
tion from the Dance-a-thon. 

Cots will be provided for the 
dancers. The couples will be 
allowed to sleep four hours each 
night, from 3 a.m. to 7 a.m.

P.O. Box Q 
The Dean Obiects 

Dear Editor: 
I take exception to the fact that The Observer has printed an interview with an individual in this community and has publicly lab­eled him as a homosexual. I believe that this public identifica­tion is wrong and is harmful to such an individual despite the fact that the individual freely chose to be so identified. 
I think that this kind of labeling will harmfully affect a person's relationships with many members of the entire community since they will tend to see that person as a homosexual rather than the total person he is. 
In the current March issue of Psychology Today, Dr. Sagarin states that, ''The ultimate freedom of a human being is to become what he chooses and wishes to become, restrained only by forces that are genuinely beyond his control. There is no alcoholic. heterosexual. ur homosexual identity. There are only people who behaYe in a given manner, at times of their lives, in some cases over an entire lifetime. The behavior is real, but the identity is an invention. It is an invention believed in so thoroughly by some people that they have become what they were improperly tagged as being.'' In the opinion of Dr. Sagarin, it would "offer infini­tely greater freedom of choice to individuals in their development, if our language implied change, or at least changeability, rather than permanence and immutability." 
The author also notes that War­dell Pomeroy wrote about the early work at the Institute for Sex Research. "In Kinsey's files were records ... of more than eighty cases of men who made a satisfactory heterosexual adjustment which ei­ther accompanied or largely re­placed earlier homosexual experi­ence." 
People do change. Labels make it very difficult for them to do so. 
The Observer article plants too strong a brand on such an individ­ual in all his relationships in a community. I regret that The Observer did not show more con­cern.

Thanks from Udall 
Dear Editor: 

We would like to thank all those at the Mock Political Convention who supported Morris Udall with both time and effort. We appreci­ate very much the interest shown in him and the effort expended in trying to get Udall nominated. 
Naturally, we are disappointed that he did not emerge as this convention's nominee, yet we are proud of his overall showing. If nothing else, we got people looking at him, which was one of our primary goals in this convention. 
Once again, we would like to thank all those who supported Udall, and the convention in gen­eral. It was good to see people get actively involved in the politics of 1976. 
Scott Brinkman Laura Campbell 
A Great Convention 
Dear Editor: 

I would like to take this opportu­nity to publicly thank Vinnie Mos­chella, Nancy Brenner, and the entire Executive Committee for bringing to the Notre Dame cam­pus the recently concluded Notre Dame Mock Political Convention. I found this four-day event to be one of the most educational, enjoyable, and enriching experiences I have had i my three years at Notre Dame. 
Since the Mock Convention oc­curs only once every four years, the convention organizers had virtually no experienced hands to rely on for guidance in setting up such a large-scale project. However, through their ingenuity, perserver­ence, and endless hours of hard work, the convention was a huge success 
In conclusion, I would once again like to express my sincerest thanks to this small dedicated group of individuals, and only wish Notre Dame had more events and student of this kind. 
Michael Pesce 
Hubie's the Best 
Dear Editor: 
What happened at the Mock Political Convention last Friday night has been recounted many times: Hubert Humphrey was no­minated at a late hour as a compromise candidate. 
Well. I am one person who voted for HHH, and not merely because of the time. To me, he w~s a much better choice than Udall. Carter or Brown and so he got my vote. He is not too old, contrary to what backers of other candidates said. he is electable, and he has a solid background in the political world. 
No one knows how many people moved away from the Humphrey vote when it became apparent on the first few ballots that he didn't have sufficient appeal to capture the nomination, but I for one think that the convf'ntion acted wisely in nominating him. 
The reason may indeed have been the lateness of the hour, but I think that Humphrey is more than a compromise candidate. he is the best possible candidate for the job and I sincerely hope that the Democratic Party realizes this when it holds its nominating con­vention.

It Isn't Our Fault 
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiaQrt buchwald 
WASHINGTON--Just when I got my latent male chauvinist pig feelings under control the new fashions come out and I'm back to where I started. Last week's cover of Time magazine of a girl in a black bathing suit made me forget the intensive consciousness-rais­ing sessions I had attended all winter. 
The trend for this year, if I understand it, is toward the pajama look with the see-through fabric placed in areas you're not supposed to see. The backs are bare and in many cases the midriffs are exposed. There is even a rain suit that zips down to the nav~l. 
One has to assume that these clothes wouldn't have been designed unless the manufacturers thought women would buy them. And, if this is the -.:-Lse, where do we men who have been trying to stop thinking of women as sex objects stand? 
It is a terrible dilemma and one I don't think the Women's Lib people are facing up to. For example. the other night I went to a dinner party in Washington prepared to behave as the perfect liberated male. I was going to treat my dinner partners as human beings who had minds of their own and opinions on the subjects of the day that should be listened to. 
Unfortunately, the person on my right ws wearing a black net pajama top with a neckline that plunged down to heaven knows where. The blouse was held up by two tiny straps that looked as if they would break at any moment. 
The person on my left was wearing what appeared to be a sheer scarf wrapped in such a way that her bosom was pushed up and out halfway across her soup plate. 
Now you have to admit it's pretty difficult to discuss President Ford's tax-cut plans when you're faced with this kind of situation. 
My heart said,' 'These women have brains. Find out what they're thinking." But my eyes kept wandering down to other areas than their heads. 
I wanted to talk about Jimmy Carter's chances in California, and Scoop Jackson's hopes for New York with the person on my right, but all I kept thinking was, "I wonder what would happen if one of those tiny straps broke while she was reaching for a piece of roast lamb from the tray." 
Then I turned to the person on my left to get such evil thoughts out of my head. I was going to ask her if she thought we should send wheat to Russia but I noticed that the scarf she was wearing had shifted and there was even more cleavage showing than when she sat down. 
I was so ashamed of myself, because I forgot all about Russian wheat which I'm sure she would have been delighted to talk to me about. 
I turned back to the person with the two itty-bitty straps. She had her back to me which was bare all th~ way down to her lower spine. It just didn't seem to be the right time to talk about food stamps.

As I looked around the room I noticedthat all the other men were having the same trouble. We were trying to make up for years of injustice and ignorance in our male attitudes toward the opposite sex, and they were doing everything to thwart us.

Natural art course offered 
by Marjorie lrr Staff Reporter 

Docs a two-week session of 
intensive art work after spring 
finals sound like a fun start for 
summer vacation'? It will be for the 
40 students and four instructors 
from St. Mary's College who will 
attend the Second Annual Red Bud 
Trail Workshop ncar Buchanan, 
Michigan from May 17-29. 
Jim Raymo of St. Mary·~ art department desl-ribcs Red Bud as an art work~hop in a camp setting ''with students and faculty living and working together in close harmony with natun·." "This approach offers an alternative to the classroom learning situation." hL" adds. 
Raymo detailed the format of Hed Bud. "There was four areas of Ullll'l'ntration: raku ceramics. nat­ure photography. drawing and painting and fibre and natural dyeing." Raymo said. Each stud­l"nt chooses an area and spends two weeks involved in it. Last sum­mL"r' s workshop allowed only one area of conL·cntration. 
"This summer. there won't be 
the real stiff categories." Raymo 
stated. "We'll open up to combine 
the a~~as and offer intermediary 
work. 
Ficldtrips, films and visiting artists provide a variety of topics for the group discussions included in the workshop. At the end of the session. the participants will hold an exhibit in the camp. 
According to Jim Paradis, assoc­iate professor of art at St. Mary's, Raymo is responsible for originat­ing the Red Bud Workshop. Kate McDonnell. Moreau Art Gallery director, is this year's program director. Instructors at the upcom­ing session will be: McDonnell, Raymo. Paradis and Jean Battles. Ten students will be accepted into each of the four areas. 
According to last year's partici­pants. the Red Bud Workshop is both rewarding and fun. "They were two of the most productive weeks in the four years I've been here." said Debbie Gits. a senior art major at St. Mary's. Gits is returning this year "just for the experience." 
Raymo noted that he has seen

great progress in freshmen. "With an intensive situation like that, beginning students can push farther than they can in the whole semester," he observed. 
The camp is at the Red Bud Trail Retreat owned by the First Presby­terian Church of South Bend. It is located on the St. Joseph River in what Raymo termed "a very nat­ural environment." 
"It's primitive. but adequate," Raymo added. "When the artists are not hard at work, they're hard at play. Various sports and activit­ies are a part of the camp." 
Through the Red Bud Workshop. a student earns three credits. Tuition. room and board cost $270. The work is intensive and Raymo said that students can be found working at all hours. "We found that people worked much more than the required hours," he said. "The different situation made people want to work." While participants need not be art majors. Ravmo said that the amount of woi·k might be difficult to maintain for non-majors. 
The natural surroundings of the camp arc essential to the types of work done at Red Bud. Kate McDonnell explained that the students actually usc what they lind in the environment. "They go out and dig the clay from the earth for ceramics.·· McDonnell said. "They pick berries to usc as dye for fibre and natural dyeing." 
Haymo said the workshop in the outdoors is "an attempt to place ourselves in the immediate envir­onment we're working with." 
·'The c~vcryday class situation is an unnatural one. It makes more sense to get into nature.'' Raymo noted. "With everybody getting together. there's a real sense of community and from that, there is a natural ilow of creative energy." 
McDonnell urged interested students to apply. Applications and a downpaymcnt of $25.00 arc due by March 24. For more information <·;II McDonnell at 5717 at St. Mary's.

Irish cagers suffer semi-final blues 
Win thriller over Cincinnati on last second tip; edged by Michigan, 80-76, in Louisville 
by BiU Brink 
Notre Dame in the regional semi-final:. It's like putting Daniel in the lion's den. If they could only let the Irish skip the second game of the NCAA tournament, and play two regional final games, or something like that. Anything! 
For NO coach Digger Phelps and his team it gets more frustrating every year, because for the third straight year they have won their first NCAA tourney contest only to be ousted in the regional sem1-finals. And if you mention the word Michigan around the ACC you really strike a nerve because for the second time in three years the Michigan Wolverines have eliminated the Irish. this time by a score of 80-76 last Thursday night in the Midwest Regional semi-final game in Louisville, Kentucky. 
Two years ago Notre Dame seemed destined for the final four when the Wolves upset John Shumate, Gary Brokaw and co. in Tuscaloosa. Alabama. This year's game was not an upset, but it was a heartbreaker for the Irish. It was particularly distressing because NO had won such a thrilling opening game. edging Cincinnat' 79-78 on Toby Knight's tip-in with 2 seconds left in the game. 
''Michigan played well,·· said a despondent Phelps after the game. "They had two great comebacks. We shot SO per cent, which is good for us, controlled the boards and still lost. That's a tribute to Michigan and their 



aggressiveness. They had a job to do and they did it well.'' 

For Digger Phelps it was disbelief, for Adrian Dantley it was disappointment, and for the IrishNot without some help from the Irish though. The story and their fans it was wait until next year (Photo by Ed Brower)of the game was turnovers. Notre Dame finished with 23

But as he went up the Errant passes. traveling violations and more errant passes Williams, otherwise known as Second-half Duck, began to ball slipped out of his hands, bounced off his chest and killed NO when it counted. In the last several minutes turn in his late-game heroics again. He hit a driving layup rolled out of bounds, dragging Notre Dame's chances of an

MU's John Robinson stole another pass, and though his Green added two free throws to set the final score at 80-76 . ..Our turnovers really hurt us," admitted Phelps. "And breakaway lay-up attempt was blocked, he took a pass The Irish had appeared to take command in the first

"These kids just never quit," said Wolve coach Johnny Orr of his players. ·'The key things in the game for us were that we played more aggressive defense in the second half and held our own on rebounds--that's pretty good for a bunch of little guys." 
His little guys were also very fast little guys. Several times late in the game they streaked in front of some careless Irish passes and raced down the court for scores. After Adrian Dantley's spinning layup had given the Irish their last lead. 70-69, with 4:04 left in the game, Michigan came back with four straight points on a Phil ~ubbard NO's Dice Martin then stole the ball from Staton, and was fouled on his attempt for the bucket, but he missed the foul shot and Michigan's Steve Grote converted on two free throws to put the Wolves up by four, 78-74 with :27 remaining. Dependable Duck came through again six seconds later, and NO's fierce pressure caused the Wolves to throw the in-bounds pass to Dave Batton. Notre Dame called time out with sixteen ·:~.:onos left, down by two. 

Then came the play which Irish players, coaches and fans must still sec in their nightmares. And it came from, of all people, the Duck. Duck took the in-bounds pass and 
"I've been to three straight regionals and four overall and haven't gotten out of one," lamented Phelps. "Naturally you're always trying to think of ways to improve. You only hope you can find something for the future." 
Part of Notre Dame's future depends on what Adrian Dantley's future is. But the All-American forward says he still hasn't made up his mind. that it's "still SO-SO." 
The Irish finish the season with a 23-6 record, their best record since 1973-74.

Three second period Michigan goals by Pat Hughes, Don Dufek and Angie Moretto, bolted the Wolves to a 5-1 advantage. 
Brian Walsh cut the margin to 5-2 with just 36 seconds remaining. 
Less than a minute into the third stanza, Clark Hamilton belted a line drive past a surprised Robbie Moore and suddenly Notre Dame was just two goals down. 
But Michigan exploded for three more goals. Moretto got one after Peterson was hounded by a barrage of Wolverine shots. Kris Manery added another less than a minute later and Dave DeBol capped off the night's scoring after stealing the puck and waltzing in alone on Peterson. 
Nofre Dame entered the second night of play with the unenviable task of trying to outscore the hometown Wolves by five goals or more. Though they lost the war, the Irish won that last battle, S-4.
