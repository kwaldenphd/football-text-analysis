Soviets announce new program for economy 
Palestinian family gives the victory salute in an expression of defiance after their home was completely destroyed by Israeli soldiers Tuesday, in the West Bank town of Sinjil. 
MOSCOW (AP) The Russian parliament voted Wednesday to start a 500-day transition to a market economy on Thursday, putting it on a collision course with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the national legislature. 
Gorbachev and the Supreme Soviet legislature agreed Oct. 19 on a compromise economic rescue plan that is slower and less radical than the 500-day plan. 
Russia, the largest of the 15 Soviet republics, has declared sovereignty from the central Soviet government. It claims the right to put its own economic reform plan into effect on its territory, which covers two-thirds of the Soviet land mass. 
It is unclear who will be obeyed if the Russian government. led by Gorbachev's leading political rival, Boris N. Yeltsin, gives economic orders that contradict the national government. 
Already, the central gov­ernment has warned bank officials they will be fired if they carry out a new Russian republic law creating independent banks, according to Deputy Russian Premier Gennady Filshin. 
The Russian parliament also challenged the Kremlin by claiming control over the 
republic's natural resources and other assets, including state institutions and construction projects, Tass reported. 
It said the legislation was intended to "lay the foundations for the republic's economic sovereignty." The bill says the Russian government has the right to accredit foreign firms and control imports and exports from its territory. 
The parliament voted 155 to nine with two abstentions to begin implementing the 500­day plan on Thursday, but it did not approve any specific steps. It had previously approved the plan on Sept. 11. 
Ivan Silaev, the republic's prime minister, told parliament that a series of proposed laws would be drafted within the next three weeks. 
"Really, all this means is they have started the clock ticking and underlined their determination to go ahead" with the 500-day plan, said Shod Muladzhanov, a political commentator for the newspaper Moskovskaya Pravda. 
"I spent the whole day here asking people what concrete steps they planned to take, and no one could give me an answer," he added, gesturing from a balcony overlooking the parliament's marble meeting hall.

concerning Notre K hi W I h 
Dame have surprised at een e S 
m~ver the summer. Asst. Viewpoint Editor when the steroids issue surfaced, one media person commented that when you live in a glass house, you have to expect a few stones hurled your way. He went on to call Notre Dame the "quintessential glass house." More recently, the media has made com­ments similar to the line that opened a Chicago Tribune article following the Stan­, ford game, "The Irish are mere mortals." Perhaps these comments are just sensa­tionalized news lead-ins, yet they may give rise to some interesting reflections on our part with respect to our public and private identity. Why do those who deliver such news about us to the public seem to delight in any opportunity to criticize us? Lou Holtz said in a press conference that to get the number one ranking we have to win consistently and convincingly, implying that perhaps we are judged on a different, more difficult stan­dard than other teams. So, even in our achievements, it seems our critics are exceedingly unmerciful on the football field and, I would suggest, in a gen­eral response to Notre Dame. The "glass house" analogy is a useful one when one tries to understand these outsider reactions to Notre Dame. Perhaps we could excuse this anti-NO sentiment as sore­losership on the part of members of the public and media that have loyalties to other schools and want to see the long-time winning team lose a few. But I am inclined to see this issue in a broader light, where the media commentary on football is just one example of a broader-based sentiment. I don't think people would disagree if I said that religion and morality are a large part of our identity both as we see it, and as it is seen from the outside. We have seldom attempted to hide our positions on moral is­sues. And these are often stances that, in this age of conformity, make a lot of people uncomfortable. Our openness with respect to our morality and, as a result, our vulnerability to the scrutiny and criticism of others lend them­selves to the glass house analogy. Yet, to live in a glass house is frightening because it feels like one small stone could shatter that whole image which is so much a part of us. While so many are throwing stones, the last thing we want to do is give them ammunition to be used against us. I think this is why our own behavior, as stu­dents, is so important. As an institution, we are frequently and poignantly reminded of our failures. Still, at Notre Dame we ought to realize that it is better to be dwellers in the glass house than stone throwers. ·

Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak warned Wednesday that the Persian Gulf crisis "could explode at any time." Mubarak urged "our Iraqi brothers" to realize the danger in which they have placed the Middle East. Egypt has contributed 16,000 troops, and Baghdad has 460,000 troops in southern Iraq and occupied 

Kuwait. Mubarak's warning came a day after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein reportedly told his military commanders the United States might attack Iraq within 
days and to prepare for battle.

By DANNIKA SIMPSON 
News Writer 

The Early Childhood Development Center (ECDC) will be holding a bookfair on November 2 and November 5-8 in Havican Hall on Saint Mary's campus. 
According to Terri Kosik, the ECDC, a non-profit organization, is holding the bookfair to earn money to purchase educational and classroom materials. The or­ganization will be selling chil­dren's literature as well as nonfiction books and books for older adults. World Book Encyclopedia's and Atlas' will also be available. 
Kosik also said Discovery Toys can be purchased. "(These toys) are educational, manipulative toys that foster cognitive development," she 
said. 

Office of University Computing Campus Clusters learn more about the computer labs through a computerized presentation starring the Macintosh NOVEMBER 2 2-4 PM IN THE LOBBY OF THE COMPUTING CENTER/MATH BUILDING -free t-shirts -ceremony at 2:30 -cake and refreshments  

The fair began about five years ago because there was a need to provide quality litera­ture for children, according to Kosik. "It's really hard for par­ents to find... award winning books locally." She said that award winning books were available in libraries but not in stores. 
She also said, "(The bookfalr) is a way we (ECDC) can raise money and provide a valuable service to families." ECDC will receive thirty percent of the proceeds from the bookfair. 
Kosik said reading to children is the "best pre-academic" activity parents can engage in. Although she does not suggest that parents should stop buying toys, she explained, " We're trying to offer an option to toys." 
The bookfair will be held from 7:30a.m. to 5:30p.m. 
Careers to be focus of showcase 
BY SUSAN MINAHAN 
News Writer 
"Showcase '90: Spotlighting Career and Employment Choices," will provide students and faculty the opportunity to meet over 40 representatives from various corporations, non­profit organizations, graduate schools, and government agencies tonight from 3 to 5:30 p.m. 
According to Jeffrey Roberts, Assistant Director of the Counseling and Career Development Center and Coordinator of Placement Services, the Showcase is an excellent way for students to become acquainted with in­ternship and occupational op­portunities, build professional networks, and obtain informa­tion on particular organiza­tions. 
Approximately 12 represen­tatives are Saint Mary's alum­nae, and six are fathers of Saint Mary's students. IBM, Price Waterhouse, the Food and Drug Administration, Holy Cross Associates, and Arthur Andersen & Co. number among the guest organizations. 
According to Hoberts the Showcase is one of the biggest events offered during the year because it not only provides a clear idea of the opportunities available to students following graduation, but it is an excel­lent way to gain respect from the employment sector as well.

BOSTON (AP) -College Board trustees announced Wednesday the most sweeping changes ever in the Scholastic Aptitude Test, adding some math questions that aren't mul­tiple choice and introducing optional essay questions. 
Board officials rejected sug­gestions that charges of cul­tural bias prompted the revi­sions in the test used heavily in deciding who gets into what college. 
The new Scholastic Aptitude Test, called SAT-I, will be in­troduced in the spring 1994, said College Board President Donald M. Stewart. 
In the language section, em­phasis· on reading comprehen­sion will be increased. Students will be allowed to use calcula­tors in the math section. 
The revisions are aimed in part at reducing students' re­liance on test coaches, Stewart said at the board's annual meeting. 
Critics have long charged that the SAT -the most widely used college entrance exam ­was biased, particularly against women and minorities. 
"Nothing could be further from the truth," Stewart said. "The SAT has been in almost c.ontinual evolution. It has never been set in concrete. 
"The new SAT will combine the high, academically demanding standards of the current tests with revisions that increase their educational relevance and quality for all college-bound students." 
The old SAT had 85 verbal and 60 math questions. The SAT-I will have 75-85 verbal and 55-60 math questions. 
The new math questions re­quiring students to produce an answer rather than choose one from a list will make up about 20 percent of the math section. 
The changes also include the introduction of the optional SAT-II, an expansion of the achievement tests that some schools presently give in addi­tion to the SAT to help gain admission to some colleges. 
SAT-II will include a written essay section, language profi­ciency tests for native speakers

Observers had predicted the essay would be included in the main SAT. But Gregory Anrig, president of the Educational Testing Service of Princeton, N.J., which administers the test, said field trials showed an essay would make the exam too long. 
Bob Schaeffer, a spokesman for the group FairTest and co­author of the book "Standing up to the SAT," said the changes fail to solve the prob­lem of the test's bias. 
"The new SAT amounts to little more than rearranging the deck chairs on an educational Titanic," Schaeffer said. "The SAT should be optional and it should be comprehensively overhauled to address its prob­lems." 
FairTest and other critics have claimed that the SAT tends to cover subjects that white male and affluent test­takers are more likely to be familiar with.

Stanford band can't play after it offends audience 
STANFORD, Calif. (AP) ­Stanford University's marching band won't be marching for a while after offending Oregonians with a halftime spoof of the spotted owl timber controversy. 
The "Incomparable Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band," known for shows that poke oflbeat fun at current events, was banned from the field for one game be­cause of a weekend perfor­mance in Eugene, Oregon. 
Offended spectators from the University of Oregon booed and Stanford's own supporters swamped its athletic depart­ment with angry telephone complaints. 
The band Saturday took on the northern spotted owl, a threatened species at the center of a bitter battle between the logging industry and environmentalists. Measures to protect the owl's habitat in the old growth forests of the Pacific Northwest are opposed by loggers who say their livelihood is threatened. 
"Trees and spotted owls are disappearing like crazy and ev­erybody wants to know why," the announcer said during the halftime show. 
"Mr. Spotted Owl! Mr. Spotted Owl! Your environment has been destroyed, your home is now a roll of Brawny (paper towels) and your family has flown the coop," the announcer continued. "What are you going to do? 'Me, I'm going to Disneyland!' " 
Band members spelled out "spot," then formed "pot" on the field. 
Slogans and signs at demon­strations over the owl contro­versy often depict the threat­ened bird as a menu item. 
The Oregon Ducks and their fans were not amused by the show.

New York Daily News strike grows; gains momentum as more unionist join walkout 
NEW YORK (AP) -More than 500 unionists joined striking Daily News workers Wednesday at a raucous, old-fashioned labor rally outside the News building, portraying the newspaper battle as a fight to save all unions. 
Pickets were buoyed when News columnist Jack Newfield, a management employee with ties to the city' unions, resigned. He took a job at the New York Observer. 
"If this strike succeeds, it's because the whole city is behind us," said News feature writer Nancy Stedman. "It's now about the survival of unions." 
Also on Wednesday, Daily News publisher James Hoge met with Mayor David Dinkins to discuss Dinkins' suggestions about resolving the strike. 
Hoge, who earlier this week declined to attend a meeting with Dinkins and union repre­sentatives, said he would not consider any of the mayor's suggestions until "terrorism by union members" against news­stand operators stops. 
The mayor would not reveal to reporters his suggestions to Hoge. 
The strike of eight unions be­gan Oct. 25. The Newspaper Guild, representing reporters and other editorial employees, joined the strike the next day, following months of negotia­tions over contracts that ex­pired in March. 
The unions charged unfair labor practices following an in­cident that prompted some drivers to walk out of the News' Brooklyn printing plant. The drivers led the strike hours later. 
OTTAWA (AP) -The gov­ernment on Wednesday ordered Canadian companies to ignore a 
U.S. bill that would prohibit them from trading with Cuba, External Affairs Minister Joe Clark said. 
The U.S. proposal has cleared both houses of Congress and needs only presidential ap­proval to become law. Proposed by Sen. Connie Mack, D-Fia., and known as the Mack amendment, it would make it il­legal for U.S. subsidiaries abroad to do business with Cuba. 
"This is an intrusion into Canadian sovereignty," Clark said, adding that diplomatic pressure and protests of the bill have had no effect. 
The order prevents Canadian subsidiaries from complying with the Mack bill -if it be­comes law-and forces them to notify the government of any instructions or directives they receive that relate to the mea­sure. 
"This action demonstrates our determination to block measures that infringe on Canadian sovereignty," said Justice Minister Kim Campbell. "It is the government of Canada which makes the laws and policies that govern inter­national trade and commerce by Canada-based companies." 
The Bush administration has opposed the amendment, but it is attached as a rider to legisla­tion the president wants, in­cluding measures to implement the trade embargo against Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait. 
The bill has not yet reached the White House and may not for a few days, a White House official said. Once it is received, the president has 10 days to sign it or veto it. 
Derek Burney, Canadian am­bassador in Washington, said this week he doesn't know whether Bush will sign the bill. 
"The complication for them is how they weigh ... their support for our known view, against the broader interest that this bill is intended to serve," Burney said. 
Canadian subsidiaries that would be affected by the bill did about $26 million of business with Cuba last year. 
Canada and the United States have been feuding over trade with Cuba since the early 1960s, when the Americans banned trade with Havana and first sought to extend the pro­hibition to subsidiaries of U.S. firms. 
The Canadian order, an­nounced by Clark and Justice Minister Kim Campbell, is the first to be issued under 1984 legislation known as the Foreign Extra-territorial Measures Act.

UNITED NATIONS (AP) -The Security Council's next move against Baghdad is a resolution that would put Iraq's frozen assets into an escrow account to pay for war damages, U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering said Wednesday. 
Pickering told reporters the resolution would allow Iraqi funds and property frozen for the duration of the crisis to be put into a "compensation ac­count." 
The assets from each coun­try's escrow account would not be divided until the crisis has run its course, because there is no way of assessing total costs until then. 
On Monday, the Security Council voted to hold Iraq liable for human rights abuses and war damages during its occu­pation of Kuwait. But that res­olution did not contain a means of distributing Iraqi funds. The new resolution apparently would provide such a mecha­nism. 
Pickering said the council could begin deliberating the measure later this week or early next week.

Pickering alluded to the escrow account plan Monday, when he told the Security Council that Iraq would be li­able for full compensation for the losses and damages it has caused by its illegal invasion and occupation of Kuwait. 
Iraq has about $4 billion in overseas assets, of which about $800 million are in America. That money could be used to help rebuild Kuwait if its gov­ernment is restored after an Iraqi withdrawal.

Strong arm of the law 
A policeman grasps a passenger of a mini-bus Monday after the police seized two vehicles and assaulted the occupants outside a hostel. 
Anxious hostage families worry a_bout fate and condition of relatives held in captivity 
(AP)-Simple daily rituals are growing more difficult for Margaret Williams, whose son and daughter-in-law are among Saddam Hussein's "human shields." 
She sets the dinner table and recalls a month-old letter smuggled out of Iraq in which her son says food is growing scarce. She pulls an electric blanket down from the closet and thinks of the desert win­ter's unforgiving cold. 
"It's awfully hard to do these things when you know your kids are suffering," Mrs. Williams said Wednesday from Germantown, Tenn. "We've just got to help these people out." 
Spirits were boosted late Wednesday by a report that Baghdad officials had promised that the families of American hostages in Iraq would be of­fered an opportunity to see videotaped messages from their loved ones. 
Anxious relatives were some­what less enthusiastic about another offer from the Iraqi government: to let them come visit Saddam's "guests" over the Christmas and New Year's holidays. 
"It's probably just another psychological ploy," said Dawn Bazner, whose husband was videotaped early in the crisis asking Saddam to let foreign women and children go. ''I'm hoping that we won't have to visit (my husband) there ... but if it comes down to it, I will go." 
''I'd like to see a video of him, sure," said Doris Whatley of Shreveport, La., whose husband was last reported at an Iraqi military installation. "But what I really want is for him to come home ... where he's safe." 
The families of many hostages held in Iraq and Kuwait have repeatedly called the Kuwaiti Task Force at the State Department in recent weeks to express concerns about the conditions under which their loved ones are living. 
"We are looking into the pos­siblilty of sending packages to our embassy in Baghdad to be forwarded to the Iraqi govern­ment, which would then hope­fully forward them to the hostages," said Diane Salisbury, a task force spokeswoman. 
Similar attempts have been made to get letters to hostages, but Ms. Salisbury said the pro­cess was complicated and the results unclear. She also said it was not necessarily possible or advisable to make contact with Americans in hiding. 
"In any case," she said, "we are holding the Iraqis account­able for taking care of the hostages -whether or not they receive packages from home."

Shuttle Atlantis lift-off delayed by Air Force 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -The Air Force on Wednesday delayed Atlantis' classified flight next week because of problems with a spy satellite aboard the shftttle. 
"Details are classified, and it is too early to predict a new launch date," the Air Force said in a two-sentence statement. 
The Air Force described the problem as "anomalies discovered during cargo testing." Capt. Marty Hauser, a Pentagon spokesman in Washington, refused to say when the problem was detected and declined to discuss the flight further. 
Sources speaking on condition of anonymity have said the satellite was to spy on Iraq. 
Top NASA managers on Tuesday scheduled Atlantis' launch for Nov. 9. The shuttle was cleared for flight following a fueling test last week that found it free of dangerous hydrogen leaks. 
A fueling test on Tuesday cleared the shuttle Columbia for a December astronomy 
mission. NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said it was too soon to know whether that mission would be affected by Atlantis' delay. 
"We don't know how to set dates or how to plan" because the extent of the problem the satellite aboard Atlantis is un­known, she said. 
Sources estimated the delay would be one to two weeks. 
It is the seventh shuttle flight dedicated entirely to the Defense Department. Two more Defense Department missions are planned, both next year, but their cargoes are unclassified. 
"The bottom line is it's no longer affordable" to maintain secure operations for a mission, said a Pentagon official who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
The delay was disappointing news for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which had been hoping to close the year with six shuttle flights. NASA had planned for nine missions this year, but was plagued by hydro­gen leaks on Columbia and then on Atlantis. 
The name of the event is

No one has yet unearthed a

The report accompanying the 
bill contains an unusual 
promise by Democratic con­
gressional leaders to try to in­
crease federal spending for mi­
norities by at least $8.8 billion 
over the next three years. 
The leaders promise an effort to target science and energy re­search and education initiatives to traditionally black and His­panic colleges and universities. They say they will try to set up a new federally backed bond program for new construction at the schools, of which there are about 120, mostly in the South. 
The Democrats also say they will try to increase spending on foreign aid to Africa; housing; urban development; education, health, child-care and anti­gang programs in inner cities; welfare; job training and veter­ans. 
House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said Tuesday that the language had nothing to do with the hunt Democratic leaders made last week for support for the bud­get, which the House approved 228-200.

"Take Back the Night March" regains human right to safety 
Dear Editor: 
At schools large and small, urban and rural, Midwestern or in New York, one out of seven female students is a victim of rape. When incidents of sexual assault are added, the statistic rises to a frightening one in three. Unfortunately, Notre Dame is no exception. 
In response to this, Women United for Justice and Peace, the Center for Social Concerns, Democratic Socialists of America, Campus Alliance for Rape Elimination and student government are sponsoring a "Take Back the Night March." The purpose of this march is to illuminate the areas on campus where women no longer feel safe walking alone. 
An open invitation is extended to all people. who wish to bear witness to this gross injustice. A basic human right is removed when one is no longer free to walk safely. The march is tonight, Nov. 1, at 8 
p.m. It will be a candlelit procession through campus, from O'Shaugnessy to Saint Mary's road. Please come.

Homeless plight hits close to home 
By J1m Joyce
Center for Social Concerns 

The deadline for signups for the 1991 Urban Plunge is rapidly approaching. The Plunge is a 48 hour program which enables students to see, firsthand, the struggles that the underprivileged face in inner­city America. As a participant in the Pittsburgh area Urban Plunge during Jan. 1990, I highly recommend this program. I would like to share some of my experiences from last January with you, firstly, to give an example of an Urban Plunge and, secondly, to eliminate some common misconceptions concerning the plight of the homeless in our society. 
One group I was involved with during the Plunge believes in assisting the homeless by teaching them job skills, setting them up with job interviews and helping them to develop social skills. This organization is called the Pleasant Valley Shelter and is located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The facility is operated by a group of churches on the north side of Pittsburgh called Northside Common Ministries. The shelter was run by six men who showed me the importance of helping people rebound from a bad break and getting them back on their feet as soon as possible. 
The first night before actually entering the shelter, "Reggie" (one of the men who is called the "caregiver") gave us a talk about what to expect when we arrived at the shelter. It was Reggie's talk that helped me realize what the workers were there to do, and it helped me see the homeless in a totally new light. Reggie told us that we should not stereotype the men in the shelter as fat, lazy winos who would never amount to anything in the world. He told us that many of the men in the shelter were just like us, but because of circumstances beyond their control, they were forced into this situation. At first I found this hard to be­lieve, but as I went into the shelter and began talking to these men, I found that Reggie was right. The following is a brief description of some of the men I met and how they ended up in the shelter. 
Jeff is a young man of about 26 who has very strong beliefs and who works very hard to make his beliefs known. Jeff reminded me a lot of myself in many ways. He was a college student at a small midwestern college. He seemed quite intelli­gent but stated many times that school just was not for him, so he quit. He said that since he quit college, he had been travelling around the country working for minimum wage. He was quick to add that it was the minimum wage that had him "trapped" in the shelter. He said that he did not earn enough working for minimum wage to rent an apartment, so he was forced to stay in the shelter to survive. He felt that the government should raise the minimum wage. After hear­ing his story, I tend to agree with him. 
Dean is quite different from Jeff, but he still reminded me of many people I have known. Dean is a middle-aged man who graduated from Penn State University with a degree in business. He said that his life was pretty normal until he be­gan taking classes at a local community college to earn a degree in psychology. It was at this time that his wife divorced him and took the house in the divorce settlement. Dean was without a home and, being in college, he had very little time to work to support himself. This is why he had to turn to the shelter. Dean continues to take classes and relies on the shelter for a home. 
The last man I will describe is Chris. He was approximately 30 years old. Chris said he was once a musician in a band and was quite wealthy. He told us he got mixed up with drugs and eventually became an addict. He spent all his money on drugs and ended up in the shelter. 
While I was at the shelter, I talked to many more men, each with his own unique story. But, as Reggie told us, most of these men were a lot like us. After my two days in the shelter, I can definitely see this is true. Any one of my friends, or even I, could end up in a homeless shelter if we had a few untimely bad breaks and had no one to turn to. This leads me to believe that we must do something for the poor immediately and stop stereotyping their situations. Eliminating stereotypes begins with a change in attitudes. Through the firsthand experi­ence of programs such as Urban Plunge, we can see the homeless in the proper perspective. 
This Christmas break, I urge you to participate in an Urban Plunge. It is an opportunity to gain understanding for the plight of the less privileged in our society, so that we will not be as insensitive to their needs. Looking back on my experi­ences of Urban Plunge, I found that the 48 hours of my time were insignificant compared with the ·perspective I gained while at the shelter. Homeless people demand our attention. This Christmas, give them at least that, and give yourself a chance to respect and under­stand them. You might be sur­prised at what you learn.

Wendt was alluding to Notre  
Dame's most recent setbacks at  
the hands of the Miami  
Hurricanes. Sending the crowd  
into a frenzy, Wendt concluded  
by cascading the arena with a  
series of primordial roars.  
Minutes before the rally,  
Wendt appeared relaxed and  
jovial in his dressing room. He  
agreed to take a few minutes  
from preparation for the show  
to answer some questions. Prior  
to his years at Notre Dame,  
Wendt attended a strict Jesuit  
prep school in Wisconsin.  
Noting that the prep school  
provided "absolutely no social  
life," Wendt described Notre  
Dame as "a party." He found  
"college, even the likes of Notre  
Dame in 1966, to be like Sodom  
and Gomorrah ... a valley of  
freedom."  
In his first weekend at Notre  
Dame, Wendt slept through

night of carousing in Niles,  
Michigan. "I got home at dawn,  
and the security guard was  
asleep on the sign-in table,"  
Wendt said. "My roommates

reer in comedy with the Second City troupe out of Chicago. He summed up his six years (1974­
80) with a group that included Shelley Long and Jim Belushi as being "great fun." Many as­sume that these years must have been a struggle in relative anonymity for the aspiring ac­tor. Wendt disagrees. 
" Struggle? It was the most fun. It's a riot-beautiful girls, actresses, ... partying." 
Nevertheless, as a father of five and a self-proclaimed fam­ily man, Wendt prefers the slower, more secure lifestyle he now has. 
Wendt's second gig in sixteen years as an actor has been the popular sitcom, "Cheers." He portrays barfly Norm Peterson, perhaps the most beloved tele­vision character in the history of the medium. 
In its ninth season (episode number 200 airs Nov. 8), "Cheers" is a regular at the top of the weekly Nielsen ratings. What has been the key to such longevity and success? Wendt attributes this phenomenon to the writing and directing of "Cheers." Certainly excellent character actors, e.g. George Wendt, have contributed a great deal as well. 
Borrowing the words of a "Cheers" producer, Wendt re­capitulated the trend of the show's popularity: "Somewhere in the last couple of years, we went from this old show that everyone was tired of, to this old show that everyone is suddenly fond of." Wendt digressed, "Now, I think it's like nobody wants it to go away. It's like a part of America." Wendt expects "Cheers" to continue for one to two more seasons. 
Broadening his horizons, Wendt recently completed work 
The best way to judge your reaction to X is to compare it to your reaction to Kick. It will be impossible to hate one and love the other. No matter what reaction you had to Kick, how­ever, you should agree that this album could be renamed "Kick on a film with Robert De Niro, arguably the best dramatic ac­tor in film today. When asked about performing with an actor of this stature Wendt said, "It was really interesting ... ln a conversational scene, you go, 'Wow, I can do this. I'm working with De Niro. This is cool. I'm there.' And then you come up to an intense scene, and he would just click into this mondo intense thing, and really leave 
me awed." Wendt then con­firmed that De Niro goes by 
"Bob" on the set. 
The film, presently entitled "Fear No Evil," will likely carry a new title when it arrives at the theaters. 
Despite his climbing career, Wendt has not lost his spirit for the school he once attended. Wendt's prediction for the October 20 Notre Dame-Miami showdown was, "something fairly embarrassing for Miami... Notre Dame, 35-10." 
"I took a logic course here at Notre Dame. And I passed it. And logic tells me that if Stanford can beat Notre Dame in South Bend, then we (Notre Dame) can win the rest of our games and win the national championship." In other words, Wendt believes that Notre Dame will have no prob­lem coming back because our upset to Stanford was so unbe­lievable and inconsistent. 
George Wendt presented him­self as a genuinely nice guy, much like his character, Norm Peterson. From Notre Dame to Second City to "Cheers," Wendt has amused millions. What do you say, Father Malloy, how about an honorary degree for Mr. George Wendt? 
Revisited." Or "INXS Makes More of the Same." Or "Mike's Purple Elephant."

The feeling has gone but the rage is still there, feeding the beast as it scours for food, and all the while a small voice pleading for the mercy of a kind Hell is consumed in the wake of compassionless anger. Yet it feeds. And it feeds. And it grows. And grows. As Time it expires and light it devours, its only recourse is to scream at the night it's become. And still the small voice pleads. Can you hear it?

Belles finish season tonight 
By CHRIS BACON 
Saint Mary's sports editor 
The Saint Mary's volleyball team finishes their season tonight on the road facing 1989 Division II Great Lakes Conference defending champion Lewis University. 
The Belles, 13-15, head into tonight's game still reeling from Tuesday night's decisive victory over Division I Chicago State University. The Belles swept Chicago in three games, 15-3, 15-3, 15-8. 
"Offensively, we hit very well and served smartly and aggres­sively," said Belles Head Coach Sue Medley. "We played better defense [Tuesday night] than we did in recent games." 

" I was pleased. I think we did a great job keeping the enthu­siasm up," said senior co-cap­tain Michelle Sibilsky. "We knew we could beat them and we took them in three. We def­initely played the way we wanted to." 
Sibilsky led the Belles with 11 kill and hit .714. Senior co-cap­tain Katy Killilea added eight kills. Sophomore Sara Jisa tal­lied five service aces while sophomore Karen Lorton had eight digs. As a team, the Belles hit .379. 
Tonight's game will be a challenge for the Belles. Although they feel they can beat this Lewis team, Coach Medley says confidence is the key. 
"They are one of the strongest Division II teams. It will be an emotional game for both of us. I know we have the ability to beat them. The key for us is to play with team con­fidence." 
Leyland is NL Manager of Year 
NEW YORK (AP) -Jim Leyland, who turned the Pittsburgh Pirates into con­tenders and guided them through the pressure of a pen­nant race, was selected the National League manager of the year on Wednesday. 
Leyland took a team that went 74-88 and was fifth in the NL East in 1989 and molded it into a division champion at 95-67. The Pirates overcame the New York Mets and all the odds in the stretch to finish with the second-best record in baseball. 
The Pirates had Barry Bonds and Bobby Bonilla for offense, but did not have a set starting rotation or a relief ace. Leyland juggled his staff and wound up with 18 different pitchers get­ting victories. 
Leyland got 17 of the 24 first­place votes and finished with 99 points. Lou Piniella, who led Cincinnati to the World Series championship in his first season with the Reds, got three first­place votes and was second with 49 points. 
Montreal's Buck Rodgers also got three first-place votes and was tied for third with 32 points with Los Angeles' Tom Lasorda, who got the other first-place vote. San Francisco's Roger Craig and New York's Bud Harrelson tied for fourth with two points each. 
No manager was named on all 24 ballots. Two members of the Baseball Writers Association of America in each NL city vote, and voting was completed be­fore the start of the playoffs, in which Cincinnati beat 
Pittsburgh in six games. **************************************················*****************

season with Pittsburgh. He was a career minor league man be­fore that, playing seven seasons as a catcher in the Detroit or­ganization and then managing for 11 years in the Tigers' sys­tem. 
He joined the White Sox as a coach in 1982 and studied un­der manager Tony La Russa, who remains one of Leyland's closest friends, and was finally hired to manage in the majors in 1986 with Pittsburgh. 
Pittsburgh improved the first three years under Leyland, go­ing 85-75 in 1988 and challeng­ing the Mets for most of the season. But in 1989, the Pirates slipped far back and they were given little chance this season of competing with the Mets, the defending champion Chicago Cubs or St. Louis. 
The Pirates struggled for the first two weeks, then hit their stride and took over frrst place. Pittsburgh stayed there for most of the season and, even when the Mets nudged ahead in the first week of September, would not fold as many pre­dicted. 
Leyland would not let his team collapse, guiding the Pirates with an intense yet cool de­meanor. He quit smoking mid­way through the season and just when his own team ex­pected him to become more nervous, he did not. 
Instead, he kept the Pirates in front by skillfully sticking with whoever was the hot reliever, be it Stan Belinda, Vincente Palacios or Bill Landrum. Leyland also had the benefit of Doug Drabek, who emerged as one of baseball's best starters, plus the Killer Bs -Bonds and Bonilla, along with Sid Bream, Wally Backman and Jay Bell. 
The Pirates finished four games ahead of the Mets. Many had thought the division would be decided by a three-game, season-ending series against New York at Three Rivers Stadium, but by the time the

A year later, a football tragedy still affects two players 
PHILADELPHIA (AP) ­Catcher Darren Daulton, who had declared free agency, changed his mind and returned to the Philadelphia Phillies Wedm~sday, signing a a three­year contract worth $6.75 mil­lion. 
Both Daulton and the Phillies said the key to their agreement was Daulton's right to test the frefl-agnnt markflt at the expi­ration of his new contract. 
Phillies president Bill Giles, who personally negotiated the contract, said that if Daulton, 28, had signed with any other tflam he couldn't bflcome a free agent again for five years. 
Daulton, a .206 lifetime hitter until this year, hit .268 in 1990 and set career highs in almost every offflnsive department, in­cluding games played (139), home runs (12), doubles (30), RIHs (57) and walks (72). 
General manager Lee Thomas said Daulton had agreed to a $500,000 signing bonus, a salary next season of $1.7 5 mil­lion and $2.25 million in 1992 and '93. 
"We're glad to have him be­fore he goes into the so-ealled mine field (free agency)," Thomas said. "Once you get out there you don't know what can happen. You want to keep your own and that's what we did." 
Daulton, who was visiting with his parents in Kansas, said by telephone that he and his agent

TWO TIIUl\mS UP!' -Roger Ebert, SISKEL & EBERT , 
"There's not a day that goes by," Brad Gaines said, "that I don't think about Chucky Mullins." 
He remembers almost every detail of the play: The catch. The ball being jarred loose. The scramble for the ball. Staying on his knees in an attempt to catch his breath. 
"Then five minutes passed. Ten minutes passed. I finally walked over to their huddle and asked them what was wrong. They said, 'He can't move any­thing.' I'll never forget the feel­ing that took over my whole body when I heard that."

On the field, Gaines managed to block out Mullins, to some degree, the remainder of the year. "I finished up strong," he said. 
Off the field, he couldn't get Mullins out of his mind. "I used to go to bed at night, thinking of Chucky," he said. "And when I'd

Daulton said he really didn't know what turned him around as a hitter in the last half of the 1990 season. He hit .297 in the second half. 
"Maybe it was being moved up in the order," he said. He had been the eighth-place hitter in the lineup and was elevated to batting second, where he saw a lot more fastballs. He is known as a good fastball hitter. 
wake up, he'd be the first thing I thought about. That went on for quite awhile." 
Gaines finally met Chucky face to face last December, on the day of the Rebels' Liberty Bowl game with Air Force. 
"Me and my brother drove down to Memphis, and when we got to the hospital there must've been 100 people in line, waiting to go in to see him," Gaines recalled. 
He wondered how the people would react once they learned who he was. 
"I knew it wasn't my fault," he said. "But I still felt guilty because I was a participant. And I couldn't help but wonder what all those people were thinking about me." 
Once inside, Gaines experi­
"I really had a fun year," said Daulton, whose career nearly ended in June 1986 with a se­vere knee injury. "And I think we are headed in the right di­rection. If we can acquire a quality pitcher we can win." 
Daulton said that despite the reconstructive knee surgery that handicapped him for mon~ than two seasons, "I always thought in my heart and mind I'd reach this level of play. And I'm going to do a lot better." 
Giles said he always had ad­mired Daulton because "he's a workaholic. I like people who show extra effort and dedica­tion." 
Daulton had been seeking a four-or even five-year contract, but changed his direction when the subject of retaining his free­agency rights after three years instead of five was put on the table. 
Giles said he had told Daulton's agent that the club president was goin-g on vaca­tion as of Wednesday night, and that if they didn't reach agreement by then, it wouldn't before free-agent negotiations began. That meant the catcher would lose the three-year free agency rights. 
The Phillies also announced the signing of Johnny Podres, 58, as pitching coach to succeed Darold Knowles, who was released after last season. 
enced the "most humbling ex­perience of my life." 
He explained: "The last time I saw Chucky, he was a big, strong football player, playing in the SEC, which has some of the best athletes in America. I go in there, and he's lying on his back with tubes stuck all in him. He couldn't move. He could barely talk." 
Gaines visited with Chucky about 30 minutes. Neither men­tioned the play. "We just small­talked," Gaines said. "I told him to hang in there, to keep praying." 
Gaines broke down on his way to the elevator. ''I'm a fighter and a competitor," he said. "But that trip to see Chucky showed me a whole new side to playing games."

was able to convert on oppor­tunities, leaving the score tied. 
Overall, the Belles ended the season tying the school record for wins in a season with 12, and recorded the fewest losses by any Saint Mary's varsity soccer team (3). Coach Van Meter, pleased with the success of the season, commented on the overall improvements in Saint Mary's soccer, and the school's move to Division Ill. 
"I thought it was a great sea­son," he said. "No one blew us out on that level. It it weren't for the few bumps along the way, we would have made it to post-season, after just one sea­son." 
"I think that being in Division III adds more credibility to the program and to Saint Mary's athletics in general."

Rangers knock off Kings; Sabres, Canadiens win 
NEW YORK (AP) -Darren Thrcotte set up two second-pe­riod goals and scored the clincher in a five-goal third pe­riod as the New York Rangers routed the Los Angeles Kings 9­4 Wednesday night in a battle between the NHL's two hottest teams. 
The Patrick Division-leading Rangers (11-3-0) won their eighth home game in as many tries and 11th in 12 games overall. They cooled off the Smythe-leading Kings, who came into the game with a 9-2­1 record and the best winning percentage in the league. 
Turcotte set up goals by Paul Broten and Ray Sheppard in the first 1:15 of the second period for a 4-2 lead. His seventh goal of the season capped a three­goal outburst in a 1:55 span that gave New York a 7-3 lead. 
Sabres 3, Bruins 3 

BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP)-Ray Bourque, returning to Boston's lineup after a four-game ab­sence with a shoulder injury, set up Bob Carpenter's game­tying goal midway through the third period as the Bruins tied the Sabres. 
Carpenter tied the game at 
10:15 of the third period after Rick Vaive had given the Sabres a 3-2 lead at 8:08, beating Reggie Lemelin with a shot on which Bourque screened his goaltender. 
Craig Janney and Dave Christian also scored for the Bruins, while Alexander Mogilny and Mikko Makela were Buffalo's other goal scor­ers. Boston is 0-5-1 in its last six road games. 
Canadiens 4, Whalers 2 
HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) ­Russ Courtnall scored twice, in­cluding the go-ahead goal in the second period, as Montreal handed Hartford its fifth straight loss. 
Courtnall tied the game 1-1 at 
14:25 of the first period, then put his team ahead to stay at 
8:43 of the second period on a breakaway for a 3-2 lead. 
The Canadiens added an in­surance goal at 15:48 of the second period when Petr Svoboda's slap shot deflected off Brian Skrudland's leg and into the net to make it 4-2. Denis Savard had Montreal's other goal. 
Patrick Roy made 24 saves for the Canadiens, allowing first­period goals by Sylvain Cote and Randy Cunneyworth. 

Westhead believes his system will work in the NBA 
DENVER (AP) -A man with a vision has no time to picture defeat. 
"Is it possible this system won't work in the NBA?" Paul Westhead paused, repeating the question as though this were the first time he had ever con­sidered it. 
"Maybe. I'm not going to say categorically 'No.· But that is something that will be proven to me," he added, "only after I'm satisfied that the system is in place." 
On the back wall of the Denver Nuggets office that Westhead inherited from Doug Moe nearly two months ago, there are 13 picture hooks, but no pictures. Since walking away from his job at Loyola Marymount and back into the NBA. he has made no time for anything but the system. Pro basketball, Westhead is convinced, will be made ready for the next century now or not at all. 
"What's going on here is best described as walking a tightrope stretched between two tall buildings," he said. "You have to have wits, courage, balance and you must think you are not going to fall. If you think you'll fall, you will. 
"If you master this system, you get to the penthouse sooner than the guy who would rather walk down the street, walk in the door, take the elevator and not care if he gets there 10 minutes later." 
Like most high-wire acts, this is something that has to be seen to be believed -if not believed in. 

Employing a fast-break of­fense every trip up the floor and a full-court, gambling, trapping defense every trip down it, this is Westhead's ver­sion of Dr. Naismith's game played with a finger glued to the fast-forward button. When his college teams played this way, he often referred to the 45-second clock as the "4-to-5­second clock." With the time frame pared to 24 seconds in the NBA, Westhead is fretting now about fractions of seconds. 
One writer has likened the system to football's two-minute drill played for 60, or a hockey power play that begins at face­off and never ends. Boston Celtic great Bob Cousy saw it two weeks ago and called it "schoolyard basketball." 
Phoenix coach Cotton Fitzsimmons saw it and didn't know what to call it. "I cannot describe to you that game," he said afterward. "You had to be there to see it." 
In six of the eight exhibition games the Nuggets played with the system's incendiary devices, they were burned beyond recognition. In the first one, Fitzsimmons' Suns threw down 32 dunks en route to a 186-123 win; in the third, the Atlanta Hawks scored 116 points in the second half of a 194-166 vic­tory; in the fourth, the Boston Celtics shot 70 percent from the field in a 173-155 runaway. 
Being kind, a primer of the Nuggets' preseason might read something like this: See Denver run. Denver can run. See their opponents laugh. Their oppo­nents -taller, stronger, more experienced -can run, too. 
Being less kind, the newspa­pers are having a field day. Westhead is lampooned as Dr. Strangehoop, Dr. Frankenstein and Dr. Flubber -every out-of­his-mind medical man, it seems, but Dr. Jekyll. 
His conditioning programs were recounted with reverence and labeled innovative just a few short months ago during

Loyola Marymount's breathtak­ing run through the NCAA tournament. Now they are quirky; photos of the Nuggets running wind sprints in a swimming pool are daily fare. 
One story recalled how eight years ago, during a brief stint as coach of the Bulls, Westhead may have greased his departure from Chicago by trying to convince some players they would run faster and jump higher by wearing necklaces (called "energy bars") with liquid mercury in them. Several more have used his background as a college teacher of Shakespeare to fashion punchlines. 
The humor underpinning this is supposed to be that every­body knows how funny his seri­ousness is except Westhead. 
That once he has wised up and lost enough games, this stubborn adherence to the system. this insistence that the Nuggets will learn Plan A because there is no Plan B. will go by the boards. That while an ali-or-nothing approach was fine for college kids, the guys who play for pay (often five times as much as the coach is making) and the guys who pay them will not sit still much longer. That Westhead will remember the lesson of a decade ago, when after winning consecutive championships with the Los Angeles Lakers, he was fired the day after Magic Johnson issued his "him or me" proclamation. 
If so, he has not gotten the message.

Men's soccer will face St. Louis in MCC Tourney 
By RICH KURZ 
Sports Writer 

With a 4-10-3 record, the Notre Dame men's soccer team probably couldn't be blamed if they hung their heads or devel­oped a negative attitude. 
Well, this team is not one to pout on might-have-beens or what-ifs. Instead, they're look­ing ahead to their first-round MCC Tournament match with Saint Louis, a nationally-ranked team. 
"We want to use this as an opportunity to turn our season around," said senior co-captain Danny Stebbins. 
The two teams played earlier this season at Moose Krause Stadium, with the Billikens pulling out a 3-2 win, scoring the game winner with only 11 minutes left to play. The Irish played an exciting game against a good Saint Louis team, and attracted a spirited crowd. 
After that promising start, Notre Dame has struggled. The Irish have lost their last three games, and five of their last six. Notre Dame did play well in its last game, however, a 3-2 overtime loss to Florida International, and it might have

"I was talking to a friend the 
other day, and he said that two 
of SLU's best guys are out for 
the game," said Stebbins. 

The last two years have seen 
the Irish facing the Billikens in 
the MCC Tournament, with 
Notre Dame knocking Saint 
Louis off two years ago on its 
way to the MCC Championship, 
and losing 2-1 last year. 

The seniors have a special 
motivation to play well, as their 
playing days are numbered, but 
the LaVigne twins also have 
another reason to play well ­
they come from Saint Louis. 
"This could be our last colle­
giate soccer experience," said 
Paul LaVigne. "There'll be 
about 100 people we know in 
the stands. We definitely want 
to play well." 

The Irish are certainly under­
dogs in this match, which may 
actually work in their favor. 
They appear loose going into 
the match, and are confident 
knowing that they played the 
Billikens tough earlier this sea­
son. Add in the desire of the se­
niors, who are facing the end of 
their career, and you have a 
dangerous team. At the very 
least, expect Notre Dame to 
hang close.

even won the game if they hadn't had four goals called back. 
The Billikens, on the other hand, have enjoyed a successful season, playing its way to a 14­3-2 record and a second-seed berth in the MCC Tournament. Saint Louis goalkeeper Kevin Johnston has a GAA of 0.88, and has eight shutouts on the year. 
Even so, the Irish don't sound like underdogs. 
"This is the best draw we could get under the circum­stances," said senior co-captain Paul LaVigne. "We know we can beat SLU." 
Part of Notre Dame's confi­dence comes from its new style of defense. Although the system itself is the same, a change of approach suits the Irish players better. 
"We slow the pace down, and let them come to us," said LaVigne. 
Danny Stebbins echoed LaVigne's comments. 
"We played really well [against FlU] with the new style," he said. 
A phone call Danny Stebbins had the other day also gave the Irish some more hope.

The Notre Dame women's volleyball team hopes to put a halt to its five-game losing streak tonight when it hosts the 13th-ranked Illinois Fighting Illini at 7:30 p.m. in the pit of the Joyce ACC. SportsChannel will tape the match for broadcast at a later date. 
Illinois, bringing a 15-7 mark into the match, has been a tough test of late for the Irish. In their 1988 NCAA Tournament clash, the Illini got off to a slow start, losing the first two games before taking the match in five games. 
Last year, the Irish jumped out to a quick start before go­ing down in defeat, 15-6, 15­10, 12-15, 7-15, 15-9. The Illini are by no means invincible, though. 
"Both teams have had rough seasons," commented Irish sophomore Marilyn Cragin. "We've had some tough prac­tices in the past few days, so we should be able to come out and give them a good match." 
Despite coming up short in their last five outings, the in­jury-plagued Irish have made some adjustments in hopes of finding the right combinations. Last Sunday at Penn State, the Irish played well but lost in three games, 8-15, 9-15, and 4-15 to the 31-0 Nittany Lions. 
"We lost to Penn State, but we gave them a good match," said Cragin, who registered 13 kills for the Irish in the Penn State loss. 
While the losses have been difficult and often, the Irish want to begin a win streak tonight that will take them into the fmalleg of a grueling schedule. 
"We're looking forward to giving them a good match," said Cragin.

The Saint Mary's soccer team wrapped up its first NCAA Division III season on the road this past weekend, defeating Bowling Green University and tying with College of Wooster, finishing its season at 12-3-2. 
The Belles, coming off their week-long layoff, experienced unexpected turbulence in win­ning a 1-0 match against a Bowling Green club team. 
"I thought we played well, considering we had a week off. We just had to gel," said Belles Head Coach Tom Van Meter. 
"I think that the week off hurt us. We came out slow and it was tougher than we ex­pected," said senior Trisha Troester. 
Troester scored the Belles' only point midway through the first half. On a Bowling Green goal shot, Troester beat her de­fender and drove in a 20-yard shot for the score. 
"I was on offense and the de­fender was out of place. I just happened to be in the right spot," said Troester. 
The team contained Bowling Green throughout the rest of the match. But in the second half, with strong winds on their side, Bowling Green made sev­eral offensive strikes against the Belles. Junior goalie Mary Alice O'Neill's outstanding per­formance saved the Belles from a possible defeat. 
"I really didn't feel the pres­sure. I was just doing my job. It was instinct," said O'Neill. "I think that the defense as a whole played well." 
"Bowling Green made some key shots. The wind was favor­ing them and Mary Alice had to make back to back saves," added coach Van Meter. "That really cooled their momentum." 
On Sunday the Belles travelled to then 18th-ranked College of Wooster. In an evenly played, aggressive match, the 
Belles  tied  Wooster  1-1,  
ruining all hopes of a  p£st­ 
season bid.  

The Belles came out strong offensively. Just four min Ites into the game, junior for 1ard Greer Gilliland scored the team's only point off of an ssist from sophomore center half Kristen Crowley. 
"I was really pumped u '· We all really wanted to beL this team," said Giililand. "We needed the win for post~season and they need the win for tour­nament play also." 
"We definitely outplayed them in the first half. We played them evenly in the second half," coach Van Meter commented. "But the problem was us not converting on opportunities." 
Wooster's offense came alive in the second half. With just eight minutes left in the match, Wooster scored, tying the match at 1-1. The match went into overtime, but neither team

While most of the student body was recovering from their fall break festivities this past weekend, the Men's Tennis Squad was in Athens, Georgia, participating in the Volvo All­America tournament. 
This tournament, part of the Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches Association's Grand Slam, is one of the most important matches of the year, featuring 150 of the most outstanding players from across the coun­try. 
Dave DiLucia, the No. 1 sin­gles player for Notre Dame and lOth-ranked player in the coun­try, begins play today. He was one of 32 players who received an automatic entry into the main tournament, exempting him from Pre-Qualifying activ­ity. His opponent will be Chris Cocotos, ranked last year as the No. 1 junior player. 
Of the seven Irish players who played in the Pre-Qualifying tournament, sophomore Chuck Coleman advanced the farthest. He defeated Chad Lowery of Murray State without losing a set, and continued on to win his next three matches to advance to the Qualifying tournament. He there lost to Patricio Arnold of Georgia, the No. 1 player in Argentind, 3-6, 6-4, 6-1. Coleman put on a magnificent performance before Arnold got on top of his game and put it out of reach. 
Mark Schmidt also won his first three matches to reach the qualifying round, but was forced to withdraw when, after complaining of a sore throat and tiredness, he was diag­nosed with mononucleosis. 
Ryan Wenger and Tad Eckert were both victorious in the opening round before being ousted from the tournament. Wenger defeated Marti Maure of Washington 5-7, 6-4, 7-5, prior to his loss at the hands of Karl Schulsze of Alabama 6-2, 6-3, while Eckert lost to Bart Aanes 6-2, 6-4, after soundly defeating Jay Harris of Cincinnati 6-1, 6-2. 
Sophomores Ronnie Rosas and Andy Zurcher both lost in the first round to Mike Knowles of Mississippi and Chris Munnerlyn of Clemson, respec­tively. 
"I was really pleased with ev­eryone's play," said Coach Bob Bayliss. "This type of competi­tion will prepare us well for our season, when we play four of the top five teams in the nation, and a host of schools ranked in the Top 20."
