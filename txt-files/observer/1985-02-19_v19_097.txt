In Brief 
Kremlin protocol dictates that Soviet President Konstantin Chernenko be the last Politburo member to give a speech before next Sunday's elections for the Russian Federation Parliament, in which he is a candidate. The party chiefusually speaks two days before the elections, but there was still no word yesterday on whether Chernenko would appear. The president's pre-election speech is a major event, and if Chernenko is healthy it seemed unlikely that his appearance would still be in doubt only four days ahead oftime. Chernenko, 73, has not been seen in public since Dec. 27, when he appeared on television to present medals to Soviet writ­ers. -AP 
Black residents ofa vast shantytown near Cape Town, South Africa stoned cars and fought with police yesterday when they heard rumors that they would be forcibly removed. Police used birdshot, rubber bullets and tear gas against the crowds, and three blacks were reported killed. Twenty-nine other people were re­ported injured in the rioting at the Crossroads, a huge squatter city of 60,000 people that sprang up 12 mile~ east of Cape Town in the mid-1970s. At least I 50 blacks have died in sporadic rioting in black townships over a variety of grievances since last August, according to groups monitoring the unrest. -AP

Posters to be stamped by Election Committee 
By MIKE MILLEN 
SeniorStaffReporter 
In an attempt to curtail student government campaigning viola­tions, all campaign posters must be stamped by the Ad Hoc Election Committee as a result of last night's unanimous Student Senate vote. 
Student Body Vice President Cathy David, chairwoman of the committee, explained "the reason for this addition is that we don't have the 'secret espionage force' which Ombudsman did." Under the pro­posed system, David and the other committee member Mike Quinn, ex­ecutive coordinator, would have complete discretion in administer­ing penalites for failing to abide by election rules. 
Senator Javier Oliva agreed with the new policy and said, "it is a much better system" than the current one. A final revision of the plan will be given in a future senate meeting. 
Kevin Howard, Keenan Hall presi­dent, presented a petition from the Hall President's Council requesting "a formal and public explanation of the senate's actions concerning the eligibility of the Pat Browne/Joanie Cahill ticket." The petition found "reprehensible the lack of accoun­tability through the use of a secret ballot and the inability of the Senate to enforce its own rules." The senate is currently formulating a response. 
In light of the Reagan administra­

tion's student-loan cutbacks. Karen 
McCloskey and Ed Augustine, Stu­
dent Lobby commissioners, an­
nounced the creation of the 
Committee to Lobby for Student and Financial Aid. "A lot ofcutbacks will hinder students," McCloskey said, "what we need to do is send our opinions to senators." The commit­tee will have petitions and form­letters in the near future, and also hopes to hold a workshop on what students can do about these cuts. 
Student Body President Rob Ber­tino announced the inception ofthe emergency snow removal plan. The plan involves students parking near the stadium in order to facilitate the clearing ofother parking lots. 
The senate unanimously en­dorsed the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's College Charity Ball, which is de­signed to help meet the crisis in Et­hiopia. Danny Harrison, chairman of the event, announced April 20 as the date for the ball. He said he would like to see "a 30 percent response" for the formal dance. 
Kevin McGovern, Student Activi­ties Board manager, announced several appointments to the board. Lee Broussard, former Browne/Cahill campaign manager, was appointed as the board manager. Rob Hoover will serve as the new general business manager, andJack Gallagher as controller. 
Exchange Commissioner Steve Taeyaerts announced last week's student exchange as being success­ful. He said DePaul or Villanova might host Notre Dame students next semester. 
In other matters, Quinn an­nounced the timetable for the Com­mittee for Restructuring Student Government. He said only the due dates of the various reports have been finalized.

Students vie for prize 
Special to The Observer 

A team of Notre Dame students will test their marketing and adver­tising skills as they compete for a $10,000 first prize in the 1985 Gen­eral Motors Intercollegiate Market­ing Program. The program challenges students from colleges and universities around the country to develop a cost-effective six­month marketing and advertising campaign to sell the 1985 Cadillac Cimarron. 
Team members will have an op­portunity to drive and evaluate a Cimarron that is made available to them for the duration of the pro­gram. Each school's entry will con­sist of an on-campus oral presentation and a written treatise. Entries will be judged on the quality of market research and creative strategy developed by each team. 
Notre Dame, one of 10 schools vying for the prize, will work under the direction ofMichael Etzel, chair­man ofthe marketing department. A panel of marketing and advertising professionals will visit each campus in the spring to review each team's oral presentation. The written sub­mission will be judged at GM headquarters in Detroit. 
Representatives of the winning

Bomb in Sidon kills 3, injures 40 
AMoclatcd Press 
BEIRUT, Lebanon· Acar bomb ex· ploded outside a Shiite militia office yesterday, killing three people and Injuring more than 40. In Sidon, the southern port just abandoned by Is· raeli troops, Shiites tore down Lebanese flags and obliterated pictures of the Christian president, Amin Gemayel. 
Lebanese soldiers did not try to stop the demonstration in Sidon, which came two days after the army moved in behind the Israeli pullout. The Shlltes, many of whom were from Beirut, plastered posters of Iran's Shiite leader Ayatollah Ruhol· lah Khomeini over pictures of Gemayel put up before his visit Sun· day to mark the Israeli withdrawal. 

Persian Gulf site of attack on ship 
AMoclatedPress 
MANAMA, Bahrain · Jet fighters, believed to be Iranian, attacked a Kuwaiti-registered container ship with rocket and cannon fire yester· day and set it ablaze in the Persian Gulf north of Abu Dhabi, marine salvage executives in Manama re­ported. 
One crewman was reported mis· sing from the 35,616-ton AI-Manakh, and salvage tugboats from Dubai and Bahrain battled the fire, the execu­tives said.

police. He thinks that the bars near Notre Dame do, in fact, have a prob· tern with underage drinking. 
"I don't think there's any harass· ment. They (the police) have to come up with numbers downtown and the bars near Notre Dame are where the minors are," said Seiler. 
The owner of The Commons, Pasquale Anastasio, was afraid of jeopardizing his upcoming hearing in front of the A.B.C., and thus refused to go on record with a state· ment. 
Although Five Points tavern operators differ over whether their bars are being singled out by the police or not, they do agree that it is extremely difficult to keep minors out of their businesses. 
Tony Anzalone, manager ofCorby Tavern, is frustrated with the di· lemma he and others face when checking identification cards. "We can't be Nazis. If they've got an ID with their picture and birthdate on 

Many of the Shiites were armed with assault rifles or rocket grenade launchers, but no shootings were re­ported. 
Beirut police said the car bomb exploded outside an office of the Amal militia in the Rwaiss area a Shiite suburb south ofthe capital.' 
They said the car, a Mercedes packed with explosives, was parked about six feet from the three-story building. 
The blast, at 4:30 p.m., set several cars ablaze and heavily damaged the building and two adjacent apart· ment blocks of six or seven stories each. It broke windows in buildings up to I 0 blocks away. 
sources said the attackers were 
Iranian. 
They quoted the captain of AI· 
Manakh as saying in his initial 
distress signal that his ship was "hit 
by Iranian planes." 
The sources and executives spoke on condition they would not be identified. They identified the stricken vessel as owned by the United Arab Shipping Co., which, they said, belongs jointly to Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emigrates. 
"According to information available from our tugboats, the AI· Manakh was hit with a rocket and cannon fire near the Abut Bakoush oilfield (about 90 miles) north of 
it, what am I supposed to do? We can't be turning away paying cus­tomers because we think they'll throw their IDs in the trash can if they're caught by the police." 
Anzalone, whose bar was raided last May 4 and Feb. 7 of this year. believes that the operators ofCorby Tavern were unjustly blamed for al· lowing minors inside the bar. 
"We had two people checking !D's the night we were raided (Feb. 
7) just like every night when we think we're going to be busy," he said. "The problem was when they (the minors) were caught, they didn't show their fake ID's to the police. They either threw them in the trash can or handed them to a friend. "Ilte police then thought we didn't check them." 
Seiler, whose bar (Bridget McGuire's) was raided May 4 of last year, al<;<J feels there is a problem with the checking of identification cards. He said, "You can get driver's license~ and !D's somewhere close to perft"ct. We're tough, but people are bound to get by." 
According to Keene, the Indiana State Excise Police help the tavern force their onkr~ Ambulancr-o; and cars carrying injured people sped from the den~ely populated neigh­borhood. 
In Sidoa, several thousand demonstrators · many from the radi· cal "Hezbollah," (Party of God) · lis· tened to speeches calling for an Islamic republic in Lebanon. They chanted "Allah akbar!" (God is Great) and "Sidon is Moslem! It can­not be ruled by a Maronite!" 
Gemayel is a Maronite Christian. 
At one point, several armed men halted an army jeep and tore a Lebanese flag off it. Others smashed a liquor store and a pinball parlor, apparently in line with the Islamic prohibition ofalcohol and gambling. 
Abu Dhabi," said one maritime 
salvage executive. 
The Al-Manakh flew the Kuwaiti 
flag and was carrying unspecified 
cargo from Bahrain to Abu Dhabi

Ifit is confirmed that Iran attacked the ship, it would be the first such raid by Iran since Iraq threatened on Jan. I to step up attacks on gulfship­ping. Iraq's avowed aim is to choke off the economy of its war foe by blocking Iranian oil exports. 
Early last year Iraq designated a 50-mile radius around Iran's Kharg Island oil terminal a "military exclu­sion zone" and warned international shipping to keep clear or risk attacks by Iraqi warplanes and navy units. 
owners to combat the problem. "Business people have a lot of money invested in their bars so we'll do anything we can to help," Keene said. "We have programs that we present to tavern and package store owners. We give them hints on checking IDs and ways to spot the phony ones." 
Despite the Indiana State Excise Police programs and the bar operators' best efforts, the tavern owners and employees said they still have trouble spotting the fake iden­tification cards. 
Tony Anzalone summed up the frustration of the bar operators. "The kids are jeopardizing our exis­tence. To them it's a slap on the wrist whether they tell the police they had a fake ID or not. They just get a S50 fine. We've got to go in front of the A.B.C."

SMC endorsement forum critiqued 
By ANNE GALLAGHER 
Senior StaffKeporter 
The recent endorsement method of candidates for Saint Mary's stu­dent body officers by The Observer was critiqued at last night's meeting ofSaint Mary's Board ofGovernance 
Anne Marie Kollman, vice presi dent for student affairs, questioned the board about the success of the Feb. ll 'Meet the Candidates' night and asked them how they felt about the format of the discussion. 
The Observer forum, which con­sisted of member~ of the edit<Jrial board and Saint Mary's reporters, was well received. Most board mem­bers emphasized their approval that The Observer forum took place on Saint Mary's campus. "It was inter­esting and I really enjoyed it," said Kacey Horner, public relations com­missioner. 
A few board members felt that some questions, concerning student organizations and the minorities issue, were irrelevant to the plat­form. "It seemed more like an infor­mation system for them," saidjoanie Gihlin. LeMans Hall president. 
Trish Cullo, election commis­sioner. ~aid the questions The Observer brought up were good but that the context in which they were asked was poor. "They hit the right issues; they just didn't ask the right questions." 
Tht: suggestions for improvement ranged from having a mediator for the discussion to making The Observer aware of the platform's is­sues. Despite the criticism, the board members were pleased with The Observer's presentation and were glad the forum was held at Saint Mary's. 
Julie Strazzabosco, vice-president for academic affairs, also discussed the Alumnae Phon-a-thon, March 4­7, which will attempt to raise $7';,000. "It's really the major fundraiser for development," said Strazzabosco. 
The phone-a-thon will take place Monday through Thursday, 6-10:30 
p.m. Thursday night is traditionally 'Senior Night', and seniors are en­couraged to help out that evening as they will be contacting recent graduates. Everyone who par­ticipates will be given a free five minute phone call anywhere in the United States. 
The Center For Spirituality to be formally opened at Saint Mary's 
By ELLYN MASTAKO 

News Staff 
Through The Center For Spirituality, Saint Mary's is offering its resources and leadership as a Catholic women's college to become a center for spirituality, said Keith Egan, chairman ofSaint Mary's religious studies department. 

Egan submitted his proposal to create The Center For Spirituality at Saint Mary's in March 19M4. The pro­posal was first prt·'>ented to College President John Duggan, and then to the Board of Regents who approved it last April. 
In his proposal Egan said, "Saint Mary's must refuse to jettison any of its sacred traditions and, yet, seek ways to enrich its mission as a liberal arts college in the Catholic tradition. 
"This proposal suggests that the establishment at Saint Mary's Col­lege ofa Center for Spirituality is one way for the College to affirm its traditional Catholic values and at the same time to address the crucial need in the decades ahead for a greater emphasis upon the spiritual formation of American Catholics. Saint Mary's College has a unique heritage out ofwhich it can contrib­ute to the formation of women as leaders in the Church." 
Egan said he hopes that a Center For Spirituality at Saint Mary's Col­lege will prepan: women to be the kind of leaders in the Church that the Spirit calls them to be. 
He said, "Saint Mary's is trying to emphasize its mission in an attempt to make the College a leader in the discovery ofnew roles for women in the Church." Campus Ministry, the religious studies department, and the Centerwill all be co-operating in this goal. 
After two years of planning, the Center will formally be opened March 2M. 
Monika Hellwig, a noted theolo­gian, will speak at the Center's opening. Her topic will be "Christian Women in a Troubled World, Can We Make a Difference?" The following day she will meet with students and faculty to discuss questions raised by her speech. 
"The Center will foster the ac­quisition of the skills for reflecting upon religious experience, the kind of reflection that was characteristic of Saint Mary's pioneering graduate program in theology from the 1940s through the 1960s. The Center will continue this spirit in a new way that corresponds to the needs of our times," said Egan. 
Chairman of the religious stu<ltes department since 1983, Egan received his Ph.D from Cambridge University. He is an internationally recognized scholar and teacher, and will be co-director ofthe Center. In­terviews are currently being held with prominent women theologians in order to name the other co­director. 
"We are offering Saint Mary's as a national center that will invite its own, and men and women from all overwho are interested in exploring the place of women in the Church today," said Egan. "The Center was born of the recognition of two realities in our time. 
"First, that the credibility ofChris­tian churches in the corningdecades will depend on how well they offer their people the inner riches oftheir spirituality and second, the Church's credibility will also depend in great measure on how it invites women to fuller participation and greater roles ofleadership." 
Programs will primarily be on the campus but plans are made to have some events around the country. These will include speakers, workshops, and seminars con­centrating on adult education. The Center will invite men and women ofall faiths to participate. 
Each june during reunion days the Center will sponsor continuing edu­cation for alumnae. This year Rosemary Haughton, a British theo­logian, will conduct a symposium on women in the Church. A seminar on "Carmelite Spirituality" will also be held this summer.

EAGLE PASS, Texas -Gunfire during a political rally on the Mexican side of the International Bridge sparked a stampede across the span into this border town Sun­day, American and Mexican officials said. 
Eleazar Cobos, National Action's mayoral candidate in the disputed Dec. 2 city elections, said police rushed the crowd blocking the bridge and began shooting, and nearly 100 people ran to the Eagle Pass side ofthe bridge. 
Mexican police reported no deaths and three people wounded in the violence in Piedras Negras. An American police dispatcher whose report could not be confirmed said five people died and 30 were wounded. 
A supporter of Mexico's opposi­tion National Action Party shot three judicial police around 3 p.m. during a party rally blocking the bridge on the Piedras Negras side.

In the past, students have visited various places in South Bend -such as the soup kitchen at St. Augustine's parish to make and serve soup, and to the Justice and Peace Center, which has served the needy people of South Bend since 1974. Students have also visited the South Hold Her­itage, a local civic group which helps people to repair and to maintain their housing. 
Towards the end of the day there will be a celebration of the Euc­harist, followed by a dinner. Stu­dents are then given the option of visiting the local jail to talk with the prisoners and the police officers. 
Mary Turgi, director of Campus Ministry, said, "The idea (of the mini-plunge) is to provide students 
. with a mini-experience of the real plunge held over Christmas break. The mini-plunge gives students the chance to develop a sense of the local civic community."

Napoleon Duarte faces a very rocky road 
Three months from today, for the third time in five years, Notre Dame graduates will be addressed by a head of state. This time, however, the speaker will be one of Notre Dame's own. For jose Napolean Duarte, the 
Brian McKeon 
reflecting 
first Notre Dame graduate to become a head ofstate, speaking to the class of 1985 will be a relatively simple task in comparison to his current job. 
Duarte, as you probably know, is the presi­dent of El Salvador, a country In the midst ofa bloody civil war now in its sixth year. At pres­ent he faces a monumental task · creating a democratic government in a country that has little experience with democracy. 
Duarte is not without his opponents. E1 Sal­vador, after decades of rule by a repressive military supported by the landed elites, has become greatly polarized. On the right sits the wealthy oligarchy and the military, a small minority which for years has controlled most of the land and the wealth in the country, while keeping a majority of the population in poverty and submission. The most familiar name associated with the right is Roberto d'Aubisson, the leader of the ARENA party. d'Aubisson, who counts among his friends that enlightened Senator Jesse Helms, is con­nected with the ruthless death squads respon­sible for the murder of thousands of innocent civilians. Robert White, former U.S. ambassa­dor to El Salvador, has called d'Aubisson a "pathological killer." 
On the other side of the spectrum is the left 
 revolutionaries hoping to construct a new Salvadoran society. The Farabundo Marti Na­tional Liberation Front ( FMLN ). the guerilla coalition and the Democratic Revolutionary Front (FUR), the political wing, hold substan­tial power in certain sections of the county and show no si,!lns ofgiving up. 
In the middle of this Duarte, with the assis­tance of the United States, tries to hold to­gether a democracy which currently can only be described as fragile. Duarte today is at the core of the Reagan administration policy in the region, and he looks to the United States for much of his support. He was not always a staunch supporter of the United States. In 1969, he said, "The United States maintains the Iberoamerican countries in a condition of direct dependence upon the international po­litical decisions most beneficial to the United States...Thus the North Americans preach to us democracy while everywhere they support dictatorships." 
Now, however, he sings a different tune. It has been widely reported In the American and European press that Duarte received financial backing from the CIA in the March 1984 elec­tions that brought him to the presidency. 
We do know, at any rate, that Duarte is a brave man dedicated to his country. In 1972, presidential elections were held in which early returns showed Duarte's candidacy to be leading. In a manner with which, Sal­vadorans have become familiar, the military stole the election from Duarte and pronounced their candidate the winner. Soon after, Duarte was beaten up and put on a plane to Venezuela, where he lived in exile until 1979, when the current civil war began. 
Will Duarte succeed? At this point in time it is difficult to say. Duarte's regime in El Sal­vador today hangs in precarious balance. The forces of the right hold tremendous power in addition to much of the wealth that the country desperately needs in order to avoid economic collapse. Those on the left, after fighting for over five years, will not give up the struggle unless some of their demands are met. Until Duarte and his supporters in the United States realize this, the war will grind on. 

CACPO is promoting awareness and action 
Awareness is the knowledge of one's sur­rounding environment, even of one's very self. It Is the ability to critically evaluate infor­mation and form an "awareness" of one's world which constitutes an important ele­ment of the educational experience. 
The mission ofeducation includes enabling the student to apply his or her knowledge in

some practical manner, to responsibly act

~ 
upon an informed conviction, whatever it

r 
may be. 

r 
A new campus group, the Central America

r 
r Contingency Plan Organization has been 
r formed to encourage Notre Dame students to become more fully aware of U.S. policy in Central America, specifically in Nicaragua and, based on their awareness, to act upon their convictions in a manner most personally prekrahle to the student. CACPO's m1ssion is to be carried out in a variety ofspecific practi­cal measures. 
CACPO has compiled a twenty-six page in­formation packet for each dorm. The packet includes articles from a variety of sources in­cluding Sojourners, the 1982 CIA Manual and other publications concerning the history of U.S.-Nkaragua relations, the philosophy ofthe Sandinista government and their respective "successes" and "failures," the Church in Nicaragua and other topics of interest. The packet is designed as a "tool" for further indi­vidual study and reflection and as a means for stimulating much-needed discussion of the complex issues at hand. 
In addition to the information packet, mem­bers ofCACPO will make a brief presentation in each dorm and will be available for ques­tions and discussion. The dorm reprer­sentatives will post the date of the pre11entation for their respective halls. These 
activities will serve as a prelude to SOLA's up­
coming Central America Week, during which 
further information and opportunities for dis­
cussion will be made available. 
Based on accumulated information and in­
formed conviction, CACPO will provide 
students who oppose U.S. policy in Central 
America an opportunity to express them­
selves by signing a petition to that effect. The 
petition drive will begin the week of March 4 
in both dining halls. 
Those who sign the petition will be sent a 
pledge sheet from the South Bend justice and 
Peace Center. The pledge will provide stu­
dents so inclined with an option to further act 
upon their convictions in a variety of ways, 
ranging from engaging in daily prayer for 
peace to participating in public witnesses of 
funding the local Contingency Plan move­
ment. The degree of action available for the 
student to engage in is directly proportional 
to the intensity of his or her convictions re­
garding this issue. 
It is important to note that CACPO supports 
the individual's right to his or her own politi­
cal and personal beliefs, whatever they may 
be. However, the organization is founded on 
the premise that individual convictions be 
formed responsibly through awareness and 
not "convenience." Therefore, we encourage 
all students to take advantage of the work of 
CACPO, SOLA and others in helping campus 
students to become more responsible and in­
formed citizens ofour nation. Your efforts on 
your own behalfin this manner will ultimately 
speak to your concern for your being and your 
world. 
We believe Notre Dame students are 
worthy of such concern. Please join our ef­
forts to promote awareness and stimulate 
dialogue on the important issue ofU.S. Central 
America policy. 
If you want more information about CACPO contact Gerry Foley at 239-7735 or jeanne Olson at 283-1345. 


Lucifer addresses his disciples and the media 
Upon seeing the crowds, Lucifer called his disciples (and the media) to a lecture and to talk with them in the public forum, saying: 
"Blessed are you thoughtless, for you are ours. Blessed are you who make merry, for we need not worry about you. Blessed are you who lust for injustice, for you will be satisfied with us and we with you. Blessed are you cruel, for you are made after our own image. 
Jurgen Brauer 

Sunday school 
Blessed are you wicked in heart, for you will see us. Blessed are you warmongers, for you are called the sons of Lucifer. Blessed are you who persecute others for injustice's sake, for yours is the kingdom of hell. Blessed are you when you revile men and persecute them and utter all kinds of evil against them, falsely, on our behalf. Libel and scorn, for great is your reward in hell." 
Then Luficer continued, saying. "You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth, and do not resist one who is evil'?" And Beelzebub answered, saying: "Stop burning your rubber and I will stop smoking; take a preferential option for the poor and we will divest from South Africa; create a national full employment policy and we will let Notre Dame workers unionize. Do not resist one who is evil, but get at least even with him." 
"Again you have heard this saying, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy'?," Lucifer asked. And the Devil responded, saying, "Hate your enemy and your neighbors as well so that you may be called the sons of Lucifer who is in hell. Ifyou hate those who hate you, what reward do you have? Therefore, hate those Bishops who would do good against you, curse those who bless your riches, persecute those poor Americans who need to love you (for their livelihood depends on you) and slowly mur­der whosoever in the less developed nations provides the resources upon which your life is built." 
And you have heard that it was said to the men of old: '"Thou shall not kill, not even in­sult thine brother with words'?" And the Ser­pent, old, wise and experienced, answered, saying, "Did God say ...? But I say unto you: fornication, impurity, licentiousness, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, anger, selfish­ness, dissension, party spirit, envy, drunken­ness. carousing and the like, all of these only kill ourselves. Therefore, there is nothing wrong therein." 
"And again you have heard," Lucifer said, "that it was said to the men of old, 'Do not swear at all, either by heaven or by the earth, and let what you say be simply a yes or a no'?" Whereupon they all answered, singing in uni­son: "Euphemism, Euphemism, Good is bad, and bad is good, Poor is rich, and rich is poor, Beauty is ugly, and ugly is beauty, High is low, and low is high, Darkness is ligl1t, and light is dark, Yes is no, and no is yes." 
Then Lucifer arose, saying, "Again you have heard that it is said 'Thou shall not commit adultery, even he who looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery'?" And Darkness, who is Ught, answered, saying, "If your right eye causes you to lust after Viet­nam, let your left eye not fail to eye Afghanis· tan. And ifyour right hand tingles with lust for Grenada let your left hand not fail to reach for Nicaragua. For it is better to enjoy the riches than the dearth oflife." 
Then Lucifer said to the crowds, "You are the salt and pepper of this earth. Therefore pray then like this: 'Our Fathers who art in hell, Hallowed be your names. Your kingdoms come, Your wills be done, On earth as it is in hell. Give us this day our daily evils; And don't do us any good, As we don't do any; And lead us into temptation, And deliver us from good­ness For yours are the kingdoms, And the powers and all glory."' 
And when Lucifer and his cohorts had finished these sayings, the masses rejoiced at their teachings, for they taught them as ones who had authority and not like)urgen did.

HPC speaks out on the recent campaign events 
DearEditor: 
As members ofthe Hall Presidents' Council, we consider ourselves as direct representa­tives of the student body. Every student is represented equally by an elected official, in­cluding off-campus residents. 
We believe the recent Student Senate deci­
sion  concerning  the  eligibility  of  the  
Browne-Cahill  ticket  to  be  extremely  un­ 
representative ofstudent sentiment.  

Among the things we find reprehensible are the lack ofaccountability through the use ofa secret ballot and the inability of the senate to enforce its own rules. 
We fully support OBUD in its vehement protest and we commend them for their con­sistent enforcement and responsible sense of judgment. 
On behalfofthe student body, we demand a formal and public explanation of the senate's actions. It is unfair that the students be kept uninformed on a subject in which they play so integral a role. 
In addition, we find this incident indicative of deeper problems within the structure of student government. We are anxious to cooperate immediately with the existing stu­dent government reconstruction committee in the reorganization of student government, particularly the senate. 
HallPresidents' Council 
Browne and Cahill should be expelled 
DearEditor: 
As a concerned student I feel compelled to make the following statement. Pat Browne and)oanie Cahill should be expelled from the University. They are a disgrace to the Univer­sity and to the high moral standards it supposes to have. Not only were their actions immoral and unethical, but they were an in­sult to the electoral process and student gov­ernment. Are we to believe that this type of conduct would be allowed on University ex­ams? Yet, the University seems to be tolerating cheating in student elections. I realize, however, that the administration does not have the guts to act against these cheaters. This is why it is important for the students to move. 
If this election had taken place in the "real world," both Browne and Cahill would have been indicted on several counts of election 
fraud. Are these the type of people we want 
representing the University in the "real 
world?" I know I would not want to be identi­
fied with either candidate. 
Chris Tayback's description of the Student 
Senate's actions as "incredibly wimpy" is an 
understatement. The senate had the chance to 
show the student body that student govern­
ment does work. They blew their chance and 
now it is up to the students. We must pressure 
the senate to remove both Browne and Cahill 
from the senate and bar them from holding 
any other positions in student government. 
They are a disgrace to student government 
and the student body. Let's get together and 
show the candidates that Notre Dame won't 
accept cheaters. 
Frank Andreano HowardHall 
Funai seeks to force new SBP-SBVP election 
DearEditor: 
After speaking with innumerable members 
of the student body, I have decided to insti­
tute procedures leading to a recall of the SBP­
SBVP election. 
This action will result in much speculation, 
especially on the part of The Observer. I am 
merely acting as a concerned student. I have 
no hope ofpersonal gain through this action. 
I will neither seek nor accept a position 
from any of the SBP-SBVP candidates. 
I have a two-fold reason for taking this ac­
tion. First, I believe that the student body was 
given no real choice in this election. I cannot 
understand why the Student Senate would 
bother to reinstate Pat Browne in the race. 
The restrictions placed on his campaign were 
ludicrous, almost as ludicrous as the in­
finitesimal spending limits. Second, I am tired 
oflistening to people complain about student 
government. I believe it is the one positive 
force affecting student life. If I am successful 
in getting a new election, I urge all motivated, 
not politically ambitious, students to run for 
office. 
Also, I have no qualms with the election of 
Bill Healy. I simply believe that the election 
returns do not constutute a mandate from the 
student body. If Healy believes he has been 
chosen as a campus leader based on only 24.3 
percent of student support, he should 
welcome a recall in order to legitimize his 
election. 
Student Senate decision reinforces stereotype 
DearEditor: 
Much has been written over the past couple of weeks concerning the effectiveness of Notre Dame's student government. Off­campus representative Javier Oliva has said "Student government is laughed at -many people don't take it seriously." Senator Pat Browne adds, "Student government is not respected." The events of the past weekend concerning the Browne-Cahill reinstatement are a major reason why this organization is laughed at and not respected. 
The preamble of the University rules and regulations in du Lac states, "Ifscholars are to dwell together in peace, they will have to live under law." Later it adds "some actions are ob­viously inconsistent with the ideals of this community." It appears that the actions of both Browne and Cahill certainly fit this description. 
With this in mind, it is incomprehensible how anyone on the Student Senate could have voted to reinstate Browne as a student body presidential candidate and still maintain any level of personal integrity. As representatives of this student body, there must be a point when ethical and moral values must be placed before personal friendship. As a witness to the actions taken at Sunday's meeting, it seems clear that the students sitting on the senate were not representing the student body but instead voted only for their own personal choice. 
I asked my student senator, Paul Healy, why he voted to reinstate Browne, and he claimed that the rule that was broken was not that bad. Healy, how does one measure the intrinsic qualities ofa rule? Rules do not have a good or a bad. The fact is that Browne blatantly and knowingly violated the rules established by the senate, and for this he deserves to be pun­ished. Not only should Browne and Cahill have been disqualified from this election, but they should be prohibited from further partic­ipation in student government in any way, shape or form. 
In announcing their decision the senate seemed to imply that by reinstating the Browne/Cahill ticket the students should decide this issue. This, however, is not the case at all. Regardless of the outcome of the election, the senate has made a horrendous mistake in condoning this action. Further­more, the actions of OBUD, the Junior Class, Ray Wise and Chris Tayback deserve to be commended for standing up to a set of ex­pected morals. Finally, the senate does not need less of these people, as Rob Bertino claims, but actually seventeen more. Each of the remaining members of this senate should take a long hard look at what they represent.

Broussard challenges Observer news story 
DearEditor: 
A conspiracy?Premeditation?No way. Nei­
ther the Browne-Cahill ticket nor I engaged in 
either. At no time before or during the cam­
paign did we "sit down" and plan to win the 
election in an unethical manner. Many hours 
were spent preparing the campaign -writing 
the platform, creating the signs and recruiting 
volunteers to participate in the campaign. No 
time, not even a second, was spent on trying 
to deceive the Notre Dame students. True, 
rules were broken, but they were not broken 
intentionally. 
However, on Monday, Feb. 11, the headline article of The Observer indicted Pat Browne, )oanie Cahill and myselfin a so-called conspir­acy "to cheat by not reporting all campaign expenses in advance." The article continued to say the act was "premeditated. It was not done in the heat ofthe moment." 
This article, written by Mike Millen, is an example ofpoor journalistic practice. First, it seems to me that secondhand news is usually not that accurate. The quote above was from the Obudsman Director, Henry Sienkiewicz, who supposedly was quoting a confession of )oanie Cahill's on the previously mentioned matter. When an article is written that con­tains perjurious charges against one party, it would be a good practice in the future to question all those being charged. I question why I never was interviewed about the whole matter, before having my reputation defamed in the article. I was never asked to refute the Obudsman director's charge, which I would have. 
No conspiracy existed in this election. It is sad that people think so.

It had been two years since the last time he 
did this. The first patient, Barney Clark, had 
survived for while, but not much longer than 
calves had lived in the lab. 
Had anything been learned? Was it worth 
the expense just to allow a person to live a 
few more months. maybe years tied to an air 
compressor the size ofa small refrigerator? 
Dr. William DeVries wasn't sure himself. 
Clark's I 12-day struggle with tho artificial 
heart had brought many disappointments: 
one of the valves had broken, more surgery 
had been required and the artificial heart had 
pumped too much blood to the brain. 
· But now in November of 1984, he once 
again held the future of the artificial-heart 
program in his hand: a redesigned version of 
theJarvik-7 heart with new valves that would 
better endure the stress of repeated motions. 
And to he sure, things were different this 
time. His patient, William Schroeder, was 
nine years younger and in better physical 
shape. (Clark almost died on the operating 
table.) Lessons learned from Clark enabled 
some fine tuning of the Jarvik-7. And DeVries 
-in another city (louisville) at another 
hospital ( Humana Hospital Audubon)-felt 
freer to "do what I'm supposed to be doing.' 
The word was out that Humana, a for-profit 
corporation, would pay for 100 artificial­
heart implants, a promise that finally con­
vinced DeVries to leave the University of 
Utah and the austere world ofacademic 
medicine. 
DeVries was frustrated that the University of Utah had dragged its feet on the artificial­heart program, even refusing to approve a second implantation. "By striking when the iron was hot," he told Dr. Lawrence Altman for a New York Times article, "we would have been able to answer a lot ofquestions that in a sense people had to stop and think over again, questions about the costs and whether society could handle the artificial heart." 
The questions remained when Schroeder (pronounced SHRAY-der) was brought to the operating room early Sunday morning, Nov. 
25. But after 6. 5 hours ofsurgery, the answer in part had been resolved: there would be more implantations. Schroeder had passed with flying colors and was recovering better than expected. 
In an Interview a week later, Schroeder spoke with a strong voice, gestured often and kidded with DeVries that a beer would certainly help his recovery. DeVries later acquiesced with a Coors. 
"I think the snowball's started and I don't think anybody can stop it," DeVries, 40, told the Washington Post. "A success dispels the critics and naysayers." 
Sunday, the snowball picked up momen­tum as Murray P. Haydon became the third person in history to receive a permanent artificial heart, only three months after Schroeder's operation. 
Doctors said yesterday that Haydon is adjusting so well that they have turned up the pulse of the artificial heart, taken him off a respirator and expect soon to have him sipping clear fluids. 
"Mr. Haydon's condition is so good it's frightening," said Dr. Allan Lansing, chairman of Humana Heart Institute International. 
Schroeder, however, is having some problems. It was first hoped that Schroeder could leave the hospital by Christmas, then it was Valentine's Day. Shortly after the im­plantation, Schroeder suffered three strokes, caused most likely by blood clots which formed around the artificial heart and traveled to his brain. The stroke permanently

Surgeon DeVries going strong 
impaired his speech and some short-term 
memory, but even worse it crushed his 
much-publicized "zest for life.'' 
Through January, Schroeder regained 
strength and his optimistic outlook, but in 
the last two weeks his body temperature has 
been fluctuating wildly, reaching as high as 
I05 degrees. Doctors now suspect that a 
particular drug prescribed to prevent brain 
seizures has been causing the problem. 
Though the implant operation was nearly 
perfect, Schroeder's troubles began hours 
alter the surgery when a suture on the aorta 
ruptured and spilled eight pints ofblood into 
his chest. 
DeVries opened Schroeder's chest through 
the same incision he had made earlier in the 
day, and began checking each anatomical 
area for evidence of bleeding. All areas 
looked clear. 
He then wrapped his finger around the 
part ofaortic he could not see, and the 
bleeding stopped. He tried to examine the 
area with a dental mirror, but he couldn't 
identify a bleeding point. "So I packed it with 
gclfoam, held it with my finger for I 0 
minutes, and the bleeding stopped," DeVries 
told Altman. 
The second operation upset some mem­
bers ofSchroeder's family, who for first time 
questioned the quality oflife that an artificial 
heart can provide. But DeVries had warned 
them. In fact, before the operation, 
Schroeder was asked twice to read and sign a 
consent form detailing the dangers and the 
experimental nature of the operation. 
But the quality-of-life issue remains the 
major criticism levied against the artificial­
heart program. Is it ethical, critics ask, to pull 
a desperate man from death and promise him 
life tied to an air compressor? 
DeVries says such criticism is in the 
"intellectual dark ages.'' This is an experi­
ment, he says, and Schroeder and Haydon 
understand that. Michael Hess, professor of 
internal medicine at the Medical College of 
Virginia agrees: "Only God knows when the 
future is in this profession, but you have to 
start somewhere.'' 
And in 1984, with the controversy of Utah 
behind him, DeVries was ready to start for 
real. The son ofa ship's doctor who was 
killed in World War II, DeVries came to Utah 
with his mother, a nurse, and was raised a 
Morman. He attended the University ofUtah 
Medical School, where in 1967 he heard Dr. 
Willem Kolff give a lecture on the new 
artificial kidney he had invented. 
The idea struck DeVries as "a natural thing, 
making things that work better than the 
diseased part. After the lecture, I said, 'I'd like 
to work for you.' He said, 'What's your name?' 
and when I told him, he said, 'That's a good 
Dutch name.' " 
After working nine years at Duke Univer­
siry Medical Center, he returned to Utah as 
the chairman ofcardiovascular and thoracic 
surgery where Kolff had turned his research 
attention to the artificial heart. DeVries was 
ready to be the surgeon. "I said I'd like to put 
this in a human," DeVries told Newsweek in 
1982. "Dr. Kolffsaid, 'Go ahead and do it.'" 
DeVries practiced one day each week doing the operation on animals, and when it came time for a human recipient, the surgeon l><:gan steering himselfout of the limelight. One patient who was rejected for the opera­tion threatened to die on the hospital steps, ­and DeVries feared his reputation would suffer. 
"You lose credibility Ifyou're too well 
known," he said. "I could spend all my life 
doing PR work." 
Friends describe DeVries as a quiet man ·with a dry sense ofhumor. And he is a dedi­
cated doctor who despises the arrogance 
which he says many surgeons bring into the 
operating room. 
He often comes to the hospital on Sunday to cheer up depressed patients. Occasion­ally, he changes dressings, typically a nurse's responsibility. "Yeah, people try to put you on a pedestal, but you're just a regular person," he told The Washington Post. "Oh, you get tired ofsigning cups in McDonald's, but you don't order people around and stuff like that." 
Barney Clark's wife, Una Loy, remembers DeVries as a quiet, dedicated surgeon. "I've seen him come into the intensive care unit with his shirttail hanging out, hair rumpled, sleepy-eyed, not having had very much rest and sort ofliving in the hospital." 

Louisville cardiologist Dr. Robert Goodin says DeVries' unassuming character often hides the intense care he has for his patients. One weekend morning, shortly after DeVries had arrived in louisville, the hospital's paging system called an emergency for one of Goodin's patients. 
"When I arrived (at the cardiac unit), Bill DeVries was up over this patient, all 6-foot-5 of him, doing CPR," Goodin recalls. "Here he is in a totally strange hospital. He has no idea ifit was his patient-he really didn't ask any questions -nor did he care. That says a lot about a person." 
But once in Louisville, DeVries has had to keep a higher profile. Humana's savvy public relations staffsees the artificial-heart pro­gram as a gold mine, and has pushed its hero, DeVries, into the daily headlines and nightly news. Last month, DeVries even taped a Meet-the-Press-style show with a panel of local news reporters, an unusual move for a surgeon. 

The idea for an artificial heart, however, is not new to medicine. During the 1950s at the Cleveland Clinic, Kolffhimselfwas able to keep dogs alive for about 90 minutes using a crude artificial heart. In 1969, Dr. Denton Cooley of the Texas Heart Institute first installed an artificial heart in a human. It kept the patient alive for 64 hours until a natural heart became available for transplantation. 
In 1981 DeVries received permission from the-federal Food and Drug Administration to implant a permanent artificial heart in patients who had no other choice. A year later, Barney Clark set the world of the artificial heart in motion. 
And it's a world that has been much criticized. Pioneer heart surgeon Dr. Norman Shumay has called the device a "crude device with no future." 
The artificial heart "shocks the hell out of the patient," he told The New York Times last year, "tears up the valves, beats up the kidneys and other organs and can serve at best as a crude intermediary device while the patient is waiting for a heart donor. 
"I don't think the artificial heart has any future," Shumway said. 
But yesterday, an Indianapolis surgeon who helped develop one type of mechanical heart, said the artificial heart "has to be the answer" to failed human hearts. Dr. Harris Shumacker said that problems with rejection, infection and shortages have prevented adequate treatment ofsevere heart illnesses. 

Much work remains, however. Dr. Robert Jarvik, the Utah bioengineer who invented theJarvik-7, said more research is needed before the artificial heart moves out ofthe experimental stage. Presently, he said, "it's not very likely these people will die of cancer." 
"Ifthe artificial heart is ever to achieve its objective, it must be more than a pump," Jarvik has written. "It must also be more than functional, reliable and dependable. 
"It must be forgettable."

The Jarvik · 7 artificial heart is a plastic and titanium assembly roughly the size and weight ofthe human heart. 
It consists of two bell-shaped polyurethane pumps that replace the two ventricles, or main pumping chambers, of the human heart. 
The wide end ofeach pump is covered with a flexible diaphragm that is filled with compressed air to expel blood from the chamber and is emptied to draw blood into the chamber. 
Each diaphragm is connected by a flexible plastic tube to an external drive unit, either a 323-pound air compressor, or the smaller, portable Heimes drive. 
The right pump, or ventricle, receives oxygen-depleted blood from the body and pumps it to the lungs. The left ventricle receives blood from the lungs and pumps it back to the body. 
These are the same functions performed by the left and right ventricles of the human heart. 
When the human heart is removed before the implantation of theJarvik 7 heart, parts of the atria, or upper pumping chambers of the heart, are left in place. 
Dacron "cuffs," or connectors, are sewn to the remaining portions ofeach atrium. The artificial heart is then snapped on to the cuffs. 
The air console controls the rate at which 

Chicago Tribune Graphic by Ray Shlemon 
the diaphragms compress, which in turn becomes the pulse ofpatient. Although the ventricles can beat up to 900 times per minute, they usually are kept beating at about 90 to 100 beats a minute, the average rate of a normal human heart. 
One advantage of the artificial heart is that the body does not reject the device. In donor heart transplants, the recipient's immunology system often refuses to interact with the foreign tissue. 
But unlike a donor heart, the jarvik-7 is prone to forming blod clots that can travel to the brain and cause strokes. In order to overcome the problem, the material chosen for the diaphragm was Biomer, a medical grade of Lycra, which is an elastic material used in girdles and bras. 
The valves ofthe jarvik-7 have also been redesigned since the first implantation in 1982. The new artificial heart contains Medtronic-Hall valves which resist fatigue stress much better. 
Two years ago, Dr. Robertjarvik, a 40-year­old Utah bioengineer, was named Inventor of the Year by the Intellectual Property Owners, Inc., a trade association ofpatent holders. Ironically, at that time, jarvik a tinkerer and dreamer who could not get into an American medical school on his first try, held no patents for his artificial heart. 
Does the success dispel the critics and naysayers?

When news broke last November that William Schroeder, a retired government worker from jasper, Ind., had successfully received an artificial heart, Newsweek magazine was preparing a cover story on the thousands starving in Ethiopia. 
The sharp contrast served as an eerie backdrop for what would become an intense debate about the extraordinary means ofartificial hearts. How could you justify spending S250,000 on one human life, while thousands ofAfricans starved to death because the money was not there to help feed them? 
Said Kenneth Vauz, professor of medical ethics at the University of Illinois: "We are going to have to decide as a society what we want from our biomedical projects. What kind ofperson are we seeking to create? An artificial person? 
"We are going to have to temper our ambitions and learn to accept the inevitability ofdisease, the inevitability ofdeath itself." 
Colorado Governor Richard Lumm agreed. "Hightech medicine is really the Faustian bargain, where for a few extra days oflife, we have to pay the price that could bankrupt the country." 
Last year, Lumm stated his posi­tion even more tartly. "We' -:t got a duty to die and get out ofthe way with all ofour machines and artifi­cial hearts." 
The words are strong but the point is there: the costs of the artifi­cial heart may be too high right now and the benefits too low. It is estimated that 50,000 people each year could benefit from an artificial or transplanted heart. Ifeach opera­tion cost about S150,000 (Schroeder's bill will be about 
$250,000), the total annual cost would be a startling $7.5 billion. 
An editorial in the journal America last year criticized the artificial-heart program. "Practically speaking, the money would be better spent on problems more universal and more pressing -in providing basic medical services for the poor, for instance, or in sup­porting basic research for the pre­vention ofthe disease," the journal said. 
"I don't understand the fascina­tion with these absurd, bizarre experiments," said Duke moral theologist Harmon Smith. "We have babies born every day in the U.S. who are brain-damaged because of malnutrition. It is a serious indict­ment ofour society." 
Critics argue that hooking up an artificial heart after disease has set in is a "cure" that's too little too late. 
"The three major breakthroughs (in cardiac care over the next 1 5 years) are going to be prevention, prevention and prevention," said Dr. Thomas Ryan, president ofthe American Heart Association. 
One major breakthrough will probably be the fine-tuning ofdrugs that dissolve plaque deposits on arteries, a project that could make good use ofthe S20 million Humana Hospital Inc. plans to spend on artificial heart operations. Another technique is a catheter whose tip can expand within an artery, compressing the plaque against the wall. 
But there is only so much money to go around, and presently the money is at Humana. "I think the snowball's started and I don't think anybody can stop it now," Dr. William DeVries told the Washing­ton Post in December. DeVries, who performed Schroeder's sur­gery, is the only doctor approved by the federal government to im­plant an artificial heart. 
In the end, someone will have to pay, and AlbertJonsen, a professor ofbioethics at the University of California, San Francisco, says it will be the government. "Once these expensive operations are available, is it fair to people who can't afford them that they should die while those who can afford them live? 
That's why the federal government will be pulled in," he said. 
"We have never sold seats on a lifeboat," said Morris Abram, former chairman ofthe President's com­mission on medical ethics. "And I don't think we are willing to start now." 
Doctors at Humana Hospital Audubon and others in the medical world strongly defend the artificial­heart program. 
"Every ethical standard certainly is being met here," said Dr. Allan Lansing, director ofthe Humana team. "One ofthe hardest things to make a judgment against would be a patient who is living, doing well, and would not have been alive otherwise." 
DeVries has said that critics ofthe artificial heart are living in "the intellectual dark ages." 
"We have to find out ifit works and then (debate) what it costs," he said. Injanuary, after the relative success ofSchroeder, DeVries called for a national committee to study the ethical implications of the artificial heart. 
Dr. Denton Cooley, the Houston surgeon who implanted a tempo­rary artificial heart in 1969, argues that regardless of the artificial heart's success, "spinoff's from that type ofresearch would be invalua­ble." 
DeVries is quick to point out that 

----------------------------------------------------------------......1!1111 
penicillin was discovered as a by­product ofa failed experiment. 
Many standard medical procedures were once considered extravagant. The coronary-bypass operations and the cardiac pacemaker are two examples. And 20 years ago, the artificial kidney was criticized in the Annals ofInter­nal Medicine; the argument is ironi­cally familiar: "How much money should be diverted by society into an expensive procedure that can only deal with a very small fraction ofpotentially suitable patients?" 
Currently, more than 70,000 patients owe their lives to the kid­ney machine. 
Perhaps the artificial heart will end up a failed idea. But that's how science progresses: through ex­perimentation. And while DeVries stresses the experimental nature of his work, he argues that Clark, Schroeder and Haydon are far more than mere guinea pigs. 
"A success dispels critics and naysayers," DeVries said. 
In the end, however, the artificial-heart program is a scarce resource that must be allocated, a scenario that defines politics itself. And once politics enters the picture -and it certainly has already -ethi­cal questions become harder to define. It may never be decided if man should be playing with what man cannot live without.

'Mischief:' Growing up in a meaningless film 
Anne Garibaldi 
Movie review 

"M ischkf' is a typical teenage 
movie about growing up. 
The film is full of the old conflicts of 
"the new kid in town," rich vs. 
poor, the Fonzi type vs. the Richie 
Cunningham type, and parents vs. 
children. The makers of"Mischief' 
could have gone deeper into any 
one of these themes, but instead 
they only brushed upon them, 
resulting in a very shallow film. 
It is the story of two high school 
seniors: Jonathan, a clutzy wimp 
played by Doug McKeon, and Gene, 
a tough and streetwise "new kid in 
town" played by Cris Nash. The 
movie is set in Nelsonville, Ohio 
(population 5,000). The year is 
1956, a time when America's value 
system is heginning to change. 
The theme of" Mischief' is what 
is on the mind of most teenage 
boys: girls. gmwit.g up, and 
friendship. Gent· has a lot to teach 
Jonathan about all of these, espe­
cially girls. because Jonathan has 
severe girl problems. Jonathan's love in life is the beautiful Marilyn 
(Kelly Preston), every high school 
boy's dream girl. The only blot on Jonathan's dream is that she 
doesn't know he exists. There are several amusing scenes where Jonathan tries to impress her, but only succeeds in making a fool of himself Gene bets he can change all of that. IfJonathan follows his advice, Jonathan can have Marilyn in hi~ arms, and elsewhere, in no 
time. 
Mt·anwhile, Gene has a girl prob­lem ofhis own. The girl he likes, Bunny (Catherine Mary Stewart), is the "possession" of the rich, mean, and viscious Kenny ( D.W. Brown). Gene is in a much better position than .Jonathan; Bunny likes him. Of course, Kenny isn't all that crazy about the idea ofGene and Bunny getting together, and he shows it by trying to get back at Gene every chance he can. Naturally the good guy always wins. 
flow ahout .Jonath.wt Gene's addu:~ finally succeed~ in helping Jonathan in his relationship with Marilyn. The only thing wrong now is that he realizes Marilyn isn't what he really wants. His attraction for her could never become the basis for a strong relationship. Never fear. There is a third girl in this story, the girl with glasses and braces who becomes a beauty overnight. 
All in all, the storyline of "Mischief' was worn out and predictable. In fact, I would rate it on the South Bend scale: nine below, with windchill. On the other hand, the acting was promising. The actors and actresses probably have a bright future ahead ofthem. It's unfortunate that they must start in a meaningless film like "Mischief." 
There were only two other posi­tive aspects to the film. One was the background music coordinated by Barry De Vorzon. If you like '50s music, you'll enjoy listening to the strains of Fats Domino's "Blueberry Hill" and other old favorites. The other positive aspect was the cos­tuming. It is amazing to see how much today's fashions resemble the styles ofthe '50s. 
You should see "Mischief' only if you have nothing better to do. It provides a mindless break from campus life, and not much more. 


An awkward moment from the movie "Mischief" 
Robust songs flavor 'Ain't Misbehavin' 
Mike O'Hagan 
Theater review 



I
t may not be coincidence that the 
first break in this February cold ~nap was accompanied by the arri­val ofthe Tony Award Winning Broadway Musical "Ain't Mis­behavin." For two hours on Sunday night Saint Mary's O'Laughlin auditorium echoed with the hop­ping sounds of jazz great Thomas 'Fats' Walker. The depth and spirit which pervade the music of Walker,a father of modern jazz, was expressed superbly by the cast and shared by everyone at the perfor­mance. 
The show,a Daedulus Production of New York, was a testimony to the vitality of the old Harlem nightclubs 
· which gave birth to the jazz we now know.Each of the twenty-two num­bers performed by this prestigious cast offered up a piece of the excite­ment and emotion which sym­bolized the essence of the Jazz Age. 
The musical masterfully defines the conflict between a country which was just beginning to realize its own potential and the people within the country who knew they would never have the opportunity to appreciate those benefits. 
Songs such as CharlesJohnson's "Fat and Grey" captured the country's reckless,upbeat feelings while Harry Brook's "Black and Blue" embodied the despair ofthe disadvantaged. 
Within these two songs (and the entire production) runs a common, sincere thread ofemotions. They combine the carefree, loose desires of people looking for a way to ex­hibit their happiness and love with the fears and nervous behavior of 
those trying escape or deny their 
problems. 

Songs like Walker's "The Joint is Jumpin", the closing number ofAct one and Kevin Chatham's rousing redition of"Your Feels Too Big" celebrated the diSt·overy of new sound combinations which excited a whole generation of music lovers. These robust songs still inspire audiences with their exciting tempos and biting lyrics. 
The plight ofan oppressed and down people resound in bitter songs such as "Lookin' Good But Feelin' Bad" and "The Vipers Drag." Both numbers sing of the problems facing who have to fool themselves about luck and the fate of the unfor­tunate masses who are no longer able to do so. These songs talk of the pretense which is com­monplace in their lives and ofthe efforts they make to forget that phoniness. 
However, present in both types ofsong is that upbeat, positive influence which made jazz the success it is today. 
The cast managed to create on stage an excellent example of the freedom and brotherhood which prevailed in the fanciful Harlem clubs of the 1920s.The rich voice of Charonne Cox contrasted smoothly wjth the mellow rhthym oflead vocal Kevin Chatham and created a plesant return to the jazz era.And it was this easy-going,friendly attitude of the cast which relaxed the audi­ence and encouraged them to sit back and enjoy a fine taste of his­wry.

When Reveley picked up a deflected Barlow pass and drove un­contested for a layup to bring Loyola within one with 43 seconds left. After Amatucci called his last timeout, Dolan proceeded to throw the ball away as the Irish tried to bring the ball up court against a Loyola press. 
Amatucci inserted Gately back into the lineup because of his outside shooting, and it was Gately who took the shot with 16 seconds on the clock. His shot bounced off the rim, but Carter was able to grab the rebound and give the Greyhounds another chance. 
This time it was guard Mo Hicks that took the shot, a short jumper from the lane, but it too bounced away. Fortunately for Loyola, it bounced right off a Notre Dame player and out of bounds with five seconds left. Gately followed with his miss, Carter failed on the tip, and Notre Dame breathed a sigh ofrelief. 

lf it looked like Phelps and his players were looking ahead to the rest of the week Fordham (Wednesday) and Brigham Young (Saturday), it is not surprising. They were. 
"I didn't want to wear us ou tonight," admitted Phelps. "I didn' want to press for 40 minutes. I didn' want to play people 40 minutes We're playing a team Wednesday that will hold the ball on us if they get ahead, so it was important not to waste too much energy." 
But for the width of a rim, Phelps might have been kicking himself for underestimating the desire ofLoyola and its building program.

Men's swim team finishes 2nd at Midwest meet 
By THERON ROBERTS 
Sports Writer 
ST. LOUIS -The Notre Dame men's swimming team was slowed by snow enroute to the Midwestern City Conference meet over the weekend, and never did recover from the 18-hour trip and the big lead built by Evansville in the Irish absence. 
The team arrived at the St. Louis University pool Thursday afternoon, and was limited to participating in one relay on the first day ofcompeti­tion. The long duration of the trip forced the team to lose the form it enjoyed in its running six-meet win­ning streak and prevented most of the swimmers from registering their best times of the year.

Even if the point totals had only been recorded for the events in which the Irish participated, the Purple Aces still would have been victorious. 
"I could see us coming out of the effects of the trip on Saturday," said head coach Dennis Stark. "But the 18-hour trip did affect the times of the swimmers. 
"I think we swam well coming from behind," continued Stark. "The team generated a lot ofspirit when it could have easily folded after start ing out the first day so far behind." 
Senior co-captains Tim Bohdan and Brian Casey led the list of top finishers for Notre Dame, while classmates Mike Kennedy and Paul Renz also turned in notable efforts. 
Bohdan placed second in the 200­vard backstroke with a time of Z:04.72, third in the IOO-yard back with a time of 57.03, fourth in the 200-yard freestyle with a time of 1:5I.03, and joined Benz, Casey and 
Jeff Grace for a second-place finish

in the 400-yard medley relay with a time of 3:42.25. 
Bohdan also anchored both ofthe free relays for the Irish. The 800­yard relay ofGrace, Steve Coffey,Jim Dowd and Bohdan placed second, finishing in 7:29.I, still battling the effects ofthe extended bus ride. The 400-yard free relay team of John Koselka, Chris Green, Grace and Bohdan took third place on Saturday with a time of 3:I 7.I9, its best ofthe season. 
Casey registered two second­place finishes -in the 1 00-and 200­yard butterfly, with times of 54.37 and 2:0I.49, respectively. Casey also was fourth in the 400-yard individ­ual medley with a time of 4:35.I2. 
Kennedy was the only winner for the Irish at the meet, with a victory in the three-meter diving competi­tion with a total of4 3 7. 20 points. He finished second in the one-meter event with a 395.05 total. 
Benz also finished well in the the two backstroke races. He took second in the I00-yard back with a time of 56.57 and fourth in the 200­yard back, finishing in 2:06.46. 

Even with all ofthose good perfor­mances by the veterans, perhaps the most surprising swimmer of all was Chris Green. The sophomore turned in a stellar effort in the 400-yard I.M., finishing second with a fine 4:27.79 time. He also placed in the top I2 in the 200-yard back and I00-yard free, finishing ninth and 1Oth, respectively. 
Chris Walsh finished in third place behind Casey in the 200-yard fly, with his 2:02.I6 time being his best ofhis career. 
Other swimmers finishing in the ~op six positions were Mark Jensen, fourth in the I00-yard fly ( 55.28), Grace in the 100-yard free ( 50.05), and a pair of distance swimmers in the 1650-yard free -Coffey in fifth ( I8:08.49) and Roland Hartzell in sixth ( I8:11 .60). Coffey also finished sixth in the 400-yard I.M. ( 4:40.55.). 
There were a couple ofswimmers 

who swam their best times of the 
year, but qualified in the consolation 
finals. 
Freshman John Koselka swam 

well in the 100-yard back (seventh, 
58.37) and the 100-yard free (seventh, 50.32), after missing his specialty, the 50-yard free on Thursday. Irish swimmers in the 200-yard breaststroke, Pat Bradley and Terry Dempsey, also finished with their best times of the season, placing seventh (2:24.47) and ninth (2:25.57), respectively. 
Rich Y ohon had a pair ofseventh­place finishes in the one-and three­meter diving events. 
Stark shared the title of Coach of the Year in the conference, an honor given by his colleagues. The Irish coach of 27 years modestly attri­butes part of that honor to assistant John Gibbons. 
"John has been a tremedous help to me and the team this season," Stark said.

Western Reserve was the only other 
squad who made it to Ohio's largest 
city. 
The result was a two-team match 

rather than a triple-dual meet. The 
outcome of the Notre Dame -Case 
Western Reserve meet was the same 
as the results from the last 3 7 
matches between the two squads. 
In the process Notre Dame ex­

tended its season record to I6-0. 
The Irish were never really chal­

lenged in the meet as they thrashed 
Case Western 23-4. Starring for the 
Irish in their victory were Andy 
Quaroni at epee, Mike Van der Vel­
den at foil and MikeJanis at sabre. 
Notre Dame men's fencing coach 

Mike DeCicco said he was very 
pleased with his team's performance 
this past weekend. 
"We are, and have been fencing 

exceptionally well," said DeCicco. 
"Right now we are riding on shear 
momentum. I am looking forward to 
this weekend's action." 
The action DeCicco is referring to 

is the tournament that Notre Dame

Track team runs 7th at weekend tourney 
By MIKE SZVMANSKI 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's track team h;1d many excellent showings as it placed seventh among 16 very talented teams at the Central Collegiate Championships last weekend. 
"We had some terrific individual performances against stiff com­petition," said Irish coachjoe Plane. "Every runner who qualified for the finals eventually placed and that shows that they are pretty darn competitive." 
Robert Nobles turned In solid performances, running a leg in the distance medley and in the mile relay which placed fifth, while placing second in the 600-yard run in 1:11.01, edgingout third-place Irish finisher Van Pearcy. 
Notre Dame now has qualified the mile relay, the two-mile relay, and the distance medley for the IC4A Indoor Track Championships In two weeks. jeffVanWie, who placed fifth in the 1,000-yard run at the CCC, also qualified with a personal best of 2: 11.76. 
In the field events, Uoyd Constable placed second at seven feet for the high jump. james Patterson continued to jump well, as he took second in the long jump, jumping 24 feet, three inches and sixth in the triple jump, going 47 feet, 10 inches. john McNelis ran 1:53.54 for third place In a tough 880-yard run field. 
"Overall, we competed very well," said Plane. "We beat four Big Ten schools, and the three that beat us will be three of the top four teams at the Big Ten meet."

wrestler in the country, Matt Campbell of Nebraska. Hildinger, showing his usual tenacity, was down only 10·7 in the final period, and with time winding down, Hildinger's persistence got to Campbell. Campbell proceeded to use foul language and walked offthe mat, giving Hildinger the win by dis· qualification. 
"Carl really set the tempo," said Irish wrestling coach Fran McCann afterward. "He frustrated Campbell. That (win) put us back in the meet. They became believers in themsleves, and they went out and just wrestled hard." 
Hildinger's win was followed by two superb performances by 126­pound senior Guy Locksmith and 134-pound Ron Wisniewski, who won their matches 10-2 and 11·5, respectively. 
"Locksmith and Wisniewski came out with fire and aggressiveness," McCann praised. "They did a nice job and their wins really set the tempo for us." 
Senior Don Heintzelman pro­vided the fourth straight Irish win over the Cornhuskers winning on default by injury. The Irish then hit a dry spell with losses by 150-pound Luke DiSabato, freshman Ken Kasler ( 158), captain Phil Baty ( 177), and sophomore Dave Helmer ( 190). 
john Krug, who entered the meet with a 6-match winning streak, could only muster a 3·3 draw. Irish heavyweight Dominic Prinzivalli provided three points to the Irish cause with his 4-1 victory. 

"I think they (Nebraska) thought they could blow us out," said McCann. "They just came out lack· luster. That was a real surprise. I'll take a win over Nebraska any time." 
This just wasn't an average win for McCann's squad. This is the same Nebraska that finished fourth in the NCAA last year and has been seen many times in the top ten in the past. True, it is a Nebraska squad that is young and rebuilding, but nonethe· less, a win over someone like the Cornhuskers is quite an accomplish· ment. And McCann knows it. 
"They said they would be young," said McCann, "but they get quality kids. They're attitude was bad, so we just beat them." 
From their performance against 
Purdue, it seems the Irish gave all 
they had against the Cornhuskers 
and didn't have much left when they 
faced the Boilermakers. The 35·9 
score was evidence of that. 
McCann felt that the poor mental 
state of his young squad had a lot to 
do with the defeat. 

"Our kids sell themselves short. 
It's a problem we've been fighting all 
year," said a disappointed McCann. 
"They go out timid and don't open 
up. That's discouraging to me. They 
went out and wrestled like they 
were facing Iowa. Purdue is good, 
but they aren't an Iowa or Oklahoma 
State." 

Once again, it was the 5-4 
Hildinger that paced the Irish with his win by technical default once he had built up a 15·0 lead. 
"Carl took it to the kid," said McCann. "His biggest problem is his size, but he's a competitor and he doesn't quit." 
Locksmith lost his first match of the season in a 9·0 major decision at 
126. Wisniewski could only hold on for 6:50 before he was pinned by his Boilermaker opponent. Purdue's Lilovich brothers, Joe and Dave, haunted the Irish all day as joe defeated the 142-pound Heintzel· man. Dave, the other brother, did a number on Kasler pinning the fresh· man in a mere 31 seconds. 
"He didn't wrestle well the whole night," McCann said of Kasler. "He was very sluggish. It was all mental, he worked hard all week in practice, but just didn't wrestle well. He's just showing the inconsistency that freshmen show." 
DiSabato lost an 8-2 decision to Alan Webber, and Baty dropped an 1 1·1 major decision. Prinzivalli lost by technical default when he trailed 21·6. Krug lost his eighth match of the season with a 5·1 loss that didn't please McCann. 
"John just wrestled sluggish the whole night," said the Irish mentor. 
Helmer provided the only other 
Irish team points with his 8-7 
squeaker over 190-pound Dave 
Dennis. 

The next time the Irish wrestle, 
they will travel to Milwaukee to take 
on the Marquette Warriors this Sat· 
urday.
