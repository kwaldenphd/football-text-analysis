Passing years inspire maturity and off-campus living 
Two weeks ago, I moved into my nine-month Hoosier home for the final time. It was different from my first three moving-in experiences in one dramatic way: I didn't move into a dorm. 
Off-campus life has its ups and downs. Three cannot live as cheaply as one. Dishes will not clean themselves no matter how long left near a soapy sink. The old man who used to clean our bathroom doesn't make house calls. 
The first time I passed my former dorm, that pile of brick named after Mr. Flanner, I said a Hail Mary, thank­ing the Lord for delivering me from the place once called a "penal colony"-by an assistant rector. The next time, two Hail Marys. Now, I say a rosary. Soon, I fear, I'll have to learn the Apostle's Creed again. 
Granted, many Domers love their dorms from day one, spend hours rapping with the rector and think living with several hundred members ofthe same sex is socially stimulating. They, I think, are mature for their ages. We had other names for them. 
The people with whom I lived for three years, the "we" in this story, were not of that sort. We were im­mature and spent most of our time proving it. 
"Immature" is one of those stupid words people use to describe something they can't explain. In this in­stance, it means not being grown-up enough to realize that some things are wrong, others are right, and one ought not do things which are the former. 
Immature  people  are  
mutts  on  a  walk,  sniffing  
everything  that  smells,  
treading  on  forbidden  turf, going gleefully  to  the  

bathroom wherever nature calls. 
Though all good Catholic boys who loved their mot­hers, we nevertheless felt this urge to break free -along with any thing or rule that got in the way. 
A good time was our common goal, but we were never evil enough to deliberately hurt someone. Call our movie, "Hedonists Go To College." 
Sometime during sophomore year, things began to change. I began hearing little voices in the back of my head saying,"Thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not blow up toilets, thou shalt not propel burning solid objects down the hall at twice the speed of sound." It became maddening. 
Suddenly, I couldn't remember the process for "pennying-in." My toothpaste bombs lacked creativity. Friday nights in the library seemed less offensive. 
I'm even -double gasp -getting married next sum­mer. My bride-to-be won't tolerate volcanoes at the din-

ner table. 
Most of my colleagues have taken similar plunges. The real world and a career seem right around the corner. Mom and Dad call less often. 
Many 18 year-olds don't have much common sense. Some do, or are fortunate enough to live with others who are grown-up and provide a steadying iniluence. Others, like a hurricane, dwell and prey on each other's weaknesses until one big bad situation forms. 
Dorms don't let that situation run its course, probably the best solution to the problem. Like a hur­ricane, it will eventually die out. There may be some damage. Some will have to pay the price. 
Hall staffs, priests and brothers at the head, would rather not deal with stu­dents who don't play by the rules. Who can blame them? Should the majority suffer for the few? I'm not sure. 
Notre Dame, however, is a place to learn. Mutts can be taught not to do their busi· ness on the neighbor's lawn. It just depends how you care about the dog. 
I guess my prayers, as I see 

Flanner each day, should be directed at the guys who still live there. For those ex­perimenting with grain alcohol or calcium carbide (makes a great bomb), here's hoping that you don't get caught and you don't hurt someone. 
For the mature leaders all around campus, I pray for patience, which you need much more than that copy of DuLac on your desk. Sure, l 0 students are on the waiting list for each one you throw out. But I don't think that's necessary. Time (and appropriate punishment) will produce students who have become decent citizens. 
In reality, my reason for moving off-campus does not center around a desire for unspeakable pleasure and in­dependence. Now that common sense rather than a rec­tor says, "don't do that, you jerk," stupid things aren't fun anymore. I just want peace, quiet and a few beers now and then. 
Maturity corrupts.

Affair of accused spy admitted during trial of former FBI agent 
LOS ANGELES -A woman testified yesterday she was former FBI agent Richard Miller's lover at the same time he was romantically involved with a Soviet spy, and that he ad­mitted to her he soldclassified docu­ments. 
Marta York of Portland, Ore., testified during Miller's espionage trial that she came to Los Angeles to visit him during the last two weeks ofSeptember 1984. 
She said at the time she visited him, she was unaware he was having an intimate relationship with Svet­lana Ogorodnikov, who has been convicted of spying for the Soviet Union, but he later told her. 
York said she believed Miller was divorced and she was seekinga long­term relationship with him. 
Miller, the first FBI agent ever accused of spying, was a tense and nervous man who poured out his personal problems to her, York said of her two-week visit during which she went to movies and the county fair with him. 
York, a native ofEl Salvador and a resident alien, said she warned him repeatedly that "we were being followed and watched" 
"The last day I told him somebody was taking pictures," she recalled. "He always laughed at me and said I liked to play detective." 
Before she returned to Portland, she said Miller admitted to her he was not divorced and told her he

was obsessed with making money. 
She returned home on Sept. 29, she 
said. 
Hours before Miller's arrest on 
Oct. 2, she said she received a col­
lect telephone call from him. 
"He told me he was calling me to 
warn me what had been happening 
before I heard it on the news," she 
said. "He told me he'd been inter­
rogated by the FBI ... he said he'd 
been accused of selling confidential 
material." 
She said Miller also confided he 
failed a lie detector test. 
"I asked him if he did or he didn't 
(sell classified documents). He 
hummed, then he paused, and then 
he said, 'Yes I did, only one."' 
"He said, 'I thought I had a good 
deal,"' she testified. 
She added that in the same con­versation, he confided to her he had been involved with a Russian woman at the same time he had been romancing her. 
She said Miller urged her not to talk to the FBI. 
York said she had known Milh;r as a friend since 1970 and her husband had become particularly friendly with him. When her husband died in June 1984, she said she notified Mil­ler and they renewed their acquain­tance. 
Miller, who is married and the father of eight children, faces a pos­sible life sentence if convicted of . passing secrets to the Soviets through Ogorodnikov.

Wanted: more tickets 
Next Saturday l 0 I, 70 I screaming fans will fill Michigan Stadium to see the 
Irish take on the Wolverines. Only slightly more than 200 ofthese people will be 
Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students. 
The University of Michigan alotted Notre Dame 6,000 tickets to the contest. In turn, the Notre Dame administration sold approximately 75 percent of those tickets to alumni. Administrators, football staff and players received 22 percent. Three pt·rcent are offered to students. 
For the majority ofstudents left in South Bend, get comfortable. Not one ofthe 5,000 tickets the University was allotted for the Sept. 28 Purdue game has been designated for students. Again, almost three-quarters of the tickets arc for alumni. 
Students arc given first priority for tickets for every home game. For this reason, administrative logic rules that it is only fair that alumni get first crack at gan1t·s played in their region. But fairness is not the only issue at hand. Ticket Managt-r Mike Bobinski has said that to insure alumni support, both financial and other kinds, they must be offered tickets. 
As part of the Notre Dame family, alumni deserve the opportunity to support their alma mater through football games; however, this right should not over­shadow that of tuition-paying students. A more equitable division oftickets must he reached. 
At a time when the Notre Dame mystique is being challenged on the football tlcld and questiont·d in the stands, students should not be so unfairly denied the chant·c to show their enthusiasm for the Irish. 
When the ticket office reviews its policy on away games and possibly proposes changes, as Bobinski has said it will, let's hope the administration con­sidt.·rs more than 200 of its students.

programs that make up our activities calendar 
every month. Another branch of Saint Mary's 
student government is the Student Academic 
Council, chaired by Vice President of 
Academic Affairs Julie Harmon. It deals with 
curriculum and major requirements. This 
year, we have begun a Saint Mary's-Notre 
Dame liaison Committee which will deal with 
communication between the two schools. We 
also have representatives of each school on 
both councils. 

The freshman class this year is larger than any in the recent past. I am counting on these freshmen to produce new ideas and support them. Anyone with questions or suggestions should feel free to stop by any time at our offices on the third floor ofthe Haggar College Center or attend any of our meetings. The challenge for all Saint Mary's students is to take advantage of what interests them and to speak up ifwhat they want is not offered. 
I think I can speak for everyone on Student Government by saying that we are excited for this year and are asking for your support. We are happy with the developments so far and hope our success will continue. ·

P.O.Box Q 
Responses to Safranek 
DearEditor: 
Safranek's column, which appeared Sep­tember 2, argued two major points. First, Americans who protest against this country's involvement in the policy of apartheid are frauds and second, we are only protesting to ease our social consciences of the burden of America's history ofslavery. 
Safranek grudgingly admits that American protesters are promoting some value, his term is democracy. He goes on to say, however, that American protesters are two-faced be­cause they are ignoring the oppression in­flicted upon the people of Afghanistan, Vietnam and Eastern Europe. Safranek does not have his facts correct. I hear outrage over the other injustices enumerated by Safranek from the very people who protest the policy of apartheid. 
Perhaps Safranek objects to the methods used by those in this country who oppose apartheid, but America's involvement in South Africa is largely economic, and the best tools for fighting apartheid in a country where our presence is so pervasive are economic tools such as divestiture and boycotts. 
Safranek further suggests that the moral force is taken from the argument against apar· theid because our government will suffer to sit down with oppressive governments. Con­frontation is the solution that Safranek seeks. Yet we confront unjust governments every day. Just what kind of confrontation would Safranek like to see? Nuclear? American and Americans are not silent to other injustices, but they do recognize that we cannot just nuke them away. Changing governments aJ. ways takes time. We must use those tools available to us that are both moral and ef. fective. In South Africa it is economic tools, in other countries it is diplomacy. 
Finally, Safranek says that Americans who are protesting apartheid are merely relieving their conscience of the guilt of past slavery. Such a suggestion is perhaps the most disgust­ing thing I have heard in the war ofwords over apartheid. We who are against apartheid (unhappily, I do not count Safranek among us) are truly dedicated to the idea that all women and men have certain rights. When we see our government, our industries and businesses promoting a government that denies these rights, we do what we can to protest, to in­fluence and to change. Those against apar­theid are motivated by a deep conviction that an men and women, wherever they are, are entitled to the enjoyment and exercise of these rights. In what does Safranek believe? By what is he motivated?

DearEditor:  
The September 2 editorial on apartheid  
protestors by Steve Safranek was an effort to  
put the burden of proof for change on the  
poor and least articulate, as well as their adv­ 
ocates. That may not have been its intention,  
but the article provides yet another argument  
against striking out and protesting what Is  
wrong in this world.  
The article seems conflicted even in its con­ 
ception of wrong. Speaking mystically of  
"valuable principles," it belittles apartheid  
protestors and In fact says that they lack con­ 
victions for justice. I applaud anyone who  
refuses to ignore indecency when It occurs  
before their eyes. It seems we help no cause  
by doing nothing. Unfortunately, the article  
seems to praise those who choose inaction  
and indifference over a life of conviction. It  
claims that protestors of South Africa's  
policies must justify the oppression of the  
Soviet Union. While this might be another way  
of calling liberals commies, I really doubt it.  
The effect, however, is no less paralyzing. We  
cannot hesitate to do what we can, just be­ 
cause our lives are too brief to end all in­ 
justice. There is time to speak out against the  
Soviet Union, but I think we have to start with  
our own country's problems. That might  
show more of the "consistency" emphasized  
in the article.  
The most pernicious argument in the ar­ 
ticle is that apartheid protestors, devoid of  
conviction, just speak up because it feels  
good. This seems to mean that the protestors  
feel free to point out the wrongs ofothers be·  
cause they consider themselves blameless.  
Doing so does not require much courage or  
thought. This article is not, as we may expect,  
an appeal for more attention to this nation's  
domestic problems, for example, mal­ 1  
nourished, hollow-eyed children in South  1  
Bend or migrant workers in Southern Mic­ .,  
higan. Instead, the article suggests that we  1  
turn our attention to the easily listed evils of  
the Soviet Union.  
This suggestion does not reek of principle  
or courage. I think if we are responsible for  
anything in the world, it is our own part of it  
first · the part we can most directly affect. It is  
true that South Africa Is far away. But the  
South Africa protests are just the beginning,  
not the end, as the article says. Emerson wrote  
that each generation has to choose between  
"truth or repose. Take which you please," he  
said, "you can never have both." The protes­ 
tors have made their choice, and it is not one  
ofcomfortable repose.

"people really win on MlV!" 
Just ask Kevin Herbert of 
Stanford Hall, the winner ofMTV's 
"Millions forMS" Rock-Alike con­
test. Though the last memory most 
ofus have of Herbert is his winning 
impersonation ofBruce Springsteen 
in the contest, his victory last spring 
was only the beginning ofa 
whirlwind summer affair with the 
rock scene. 
In addition to appearing on na­
tional television, Herbert was 
awarded a summer internship with 
MlV in New York. 
Herbert worked primarily in the 
marketing department, concentrat­
ing on promotional projects for 
various concerts. For example, he 
helped to ship tickets, buttons, 
T-shirts, and other paraphernalia for 
the Kenny Loggins concert tour to 
those radio stations promoting the 
concert for MlV. While the ex­
perience he gained was invaluable, 
Herbert says that "... it was the 
people that I worked with that 
made the job so great. They were 
really knowlegeable and taught me 
a great deal about the business of 
marketing and promotional work." 

Aside from working, Herbert also performed at two ofNew York's most prestigious clubs, Studio 54 and the Hard Rock Cafe. While "Born in the U.S.A." remained his trademark, Herbert did manage to perfect a performance of Springsteen's "Dancing in the Dark" as well. The talented sophomore was also interviewed by "Entertainment Tonight," The New York Daily News, and the New York Post, in addition to appearing on MTV's birthday celebration, where he met such stars as Glenn Frey and Simon LeBon. 
Sadly enough, Herbert was unable to meet his mentor, but MS officials are still trying to arrange a meeting between Springsteen and his youthful counterpart. 
Herbert is still performing though, and will be heading the Rock-Alike contest for this year. When asked if this experience would lead to any further career in singing or television, he only laughed and said, "It's a great op­portunity, and I'm going to keep on performing Bruce, but it's time to

give someone else a chance to be the best." 
Back at Notre Dame, he still listens to Springsteen, and proudly displays his pictures of Nina Black­wood and Martha Quinn (with himself) on his bulletin board. One freshman, having looked at the photographs, failed to recognize either "VJ", but when asked who was in the picture with them, replied, "I'm no fool, I know when I see Bruce Springsteen!" 
The Rock-Alike contest and Tommy Shaw concert that followed were fllmed and scheduled to be aired during the Memorial Day weekend. Because ofediting dif­ficulties withJerry Kramer Produc­tions, however, it was delayed until late July, when MS officials decided to move the concert's premiere to the first weekend ofSeptember in order to coincide with the begin­ning of the MS fund-raising conven­tion. 
The Rock-Alike contest and Tommy Shaw concert will be shown at the Senior Club on Satur­day, September 7, at a party open to all classes. At 10 p.m. the concert will be aired; afterwards, Herbert will give a live performance to show once again that here at Notre Dame, Rruce is "The Boss!"

Laverie played singles and doubles in the number-one position for the Belles all four years and was elected MVP each year. She was named captain and SMC Athlete of the Year her junior and senior years. In addition, Laverie finished off her collegiate tennis career ranked ninth in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics. 
The Belles' 10-member team con~ sists of two juniors, one sophomore, and seven freshmen. There are no seniors on the team and only one returning varsity player -Kim Drahoto. The team members in their respective singles positions are No. 1 Anne Dimbero, No. 2 Shaun Boyd, No. 3 Kim Drahoto, No. 4 Valerie Falbo, No. 5 Bridget Hertog, and No. 6 Sheila Campbell or Charlene

Sjazka. Katie O'Brien, Anne Piacentine, and Jenny Rode are the remaining team members who are not holding positions to play this weekend. 
"Although the team needs col­legiate playing experience," says Laverie, "The girls' enthusiasm is a very positive aspect. Everyone is working hard and practicing toget­her as a team." 
The Belles face a tough schedule this fall to prepare themselves for the district tournament which will determine who will qualify for Na­tionals in the spring. Saint Mary's opens with Evansville and Mar­quette this weekend. Both opposing schools are NCAA Division One teams whereas Saint Mary's is an NAIA team. 
Laverie is happy to be starting off the seasotJ with strong competition, though. 
_And that he did. 
"They are both tough teams," says Laverie, "but we've always beaten them in the past. If we keep our con­fidence, we'll do well." 
The Evansville match will begin at 3 p.m. Saturday and the Belles wlll meet Marquette at 1 p.m. Sunday. 

Replay of call enrages Yankee Stadium umps 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Crew chief Larry Barnett threatened to remove umpires from the field last night after a replay of a controversial call was shown on the scoreboard at Yankee Stadium, prompting several fans to throw objects at first base umpire Ken Kaiser. 
In the top of the sixth inning of New York's 7-3 victory over Oak­land, Mike Davis ofthe A's was called safe by Kaiser at first base on a close call. Two outs later, Dwayne Murphy hit a three-run homer that tied the score. 
As the Yankees were leaving the field after the top of the sixth, the replay was shown twice -once at regular speed, once in slow-motion ­on the large scoreboard in right­center field. 
The replay appeared to show that Davis was out, and fans behind first base threw objects at Kaiser. 
"I went into the Yankee dugout after the replays," Barnett said. "I told Billy (Yankees Manager Martin) 
that ifthey showed it one more time, I would take my umpires off the fiWJ. I do not want my umpires to

get hurt." 
"I don't expect to deprive the fans the pleasure ofwatching replays, but there is a directive in the American League that states replays should be shown with discretion. I plan on talking to Dr. Brown (American League President Bobby Brown) tomorrow morning. I told Bllly to knock it off and he said it's in the hands of George (Yankees owner Steinbrenner)." 
Steinbrenner, in the pressbox at Yankee Stadium, said: "call Bobby Brown tomorrow and see what he thought ofthat call." 
"Hey, I admire good umpiring, but let them stand up and admit it when they make a mistake. I admire umpires who admit they blew a call like that umpire did in the Boston series (in a 10-inning, 5-4 New York victory over Boston on Aug.  16. Home plate umpire Drew Coble ad­mitted he missed a call on a fourth ball to Wlllie Randolph for a walk that forced in the wining run)." 
"I don't know about any league . directive. I do not expect to get fined, but I expect a strong letter. What goes on around here is my responsibllty, not the people who run the scoreboard."

Hudson confident about quarterback situation 
ByERIC SCHEUERMANN 
Sports Writer 
With only a little more than a week left before the Notre Dame football team's opener at Michigan, many people have their eyes on the team's quarterback situation. 
After Steve Beuerlein completed over 60 percent of his passes last year for 1,920 yards, the quarter­back position seemed to be the spot that was least in doubt heading into the 1985 season. 
Beuerlein's shoulder operation during the off-season, however, raised some question marks as to whether he would be 100 percent 

Ron Hudson 

come fall. But after the 6-3, 201­pound junior's performance in the preseason, no one is doubting anymore. 
"Steve is ready to go as our starter," says Irish quarterback coach Ron Hudson. "He's been very much up to par. He's been doing everything we expect. 
"As far as the injury is concerned, we really won't know howhe is until the Michigan game. He's been hit, but nothing like he'll be hit up there. 
But he's working hard. I think he's ready." 
In yesterday's scrimmage at the Stadium, Beuerlein looked to be very ready in every way. While com­pleting eight of 12 passes for Ill yards and one touchdown, he threw the ball very well, appearing stronger than last year. In addition, he took a few hard hits while scram­bling, showing no signs ofpain. 
With another year of experience behind him calling the signals, things look very good indeed for the Irish leader headinginto the opener. 
Another development during fall practice was the decislon on a backup to Beuerlein. After spring practice, sophomores Terry Andrysiak and Tom Byrne were neck-and-neck in the battle for the number-two spot. 
But despite sufferingan injury to a 
finger on his left (non-throwing) 
hand,the6-1,181-poundAndrysiak
has emerged as the backup this fall. 
"Andrysiak is our number-two man," says Hudson. "His finger is in a cast, but he's going to get a smaller one so that he can handle the snap better. 
Backing up Beuerlein on the White squad yesterday, Andrysiak filled in admirably, completing all four of his passes for 2 5 yards and one touchdown. 
"He's doing very well, and he's learning very fast," continues Hud­son. "We're pleased both with the way he's throwing the ball and with howhe runs. The back-up spotlooks more solid now." 
Meanwhile, 6-4, 197-pound fresh­man Steve Belles is giving Byrne a battle for the number-three spot on the roster. One of the most highly regarded freshman quarterbacks in the country, the Phoenix, Ariz., native has closed the gap between himself and the 6-5, 212-pound Byrne this fall. 

"It's a close contest between Byrne and Belles for the third spot," says Hudson. "Belles' size and weight are his major strengths. He's not really that far advanced mentally for a freshman, but physically he's so strong that he can do things that maybe another guy his age couldn't do. 
"Byrne's doing real well and im­proving also. It's a tough fight for that spot." 
Battlingbehind these four are sop­homore Pat Pesavento of Lockport, Ill., and freshman Pete Graham of Rumson, N.J. 
After a spring in which he made great strides, Pesavento looked good m limited action in yesterday's scrimmage. 

The important questions have been answered, however. Often called the key to this year's Irish hopes, Beuerlein is looking better than ever. And now that Andrysiak has settled in at the number-two spot, he should be ready to playiffor any reason Beuerlein can not. With all that settled, they can now look ahead to the Wolverines. 
EXTRA POINTS -The kicking game was by the far the highlight of yesterday's final scrimmage of the season, as junior John Carney booted field goals of57 and 62 yards and freshman Jim Sacco connected from 48 yards. . . Meanwhile, sop­homore Vince Phelan continues to assert himself in the punting derby that already includes Dan Sorensen and Hal Von Wvl. .. Aside from the kicking game, however, Coach Gerry Faust was unenthusiastic about his team's effort: "We did some things well," noted Faust, "but it wasn't a real good scrimmage. We didn't come offthe ball well. Our ex­ecution wasn't good, but the kicking game was excellent -what we need 
now is to put everything together. Today we were trying to con­centrate on game situations."... Leading rushers in the scrimmage were reserve tailbacks Alonzo Jeffer­son (four carries for 79 yards -in­cluding a 49-yard TD run) and Ray Carter (nine carries for 59 yards and a touchdown). ...

The Observer 
Mutschler has all the tools for stopper position 
By FRANK LIPO 
Sports Writer 
A stopper is important on any team, whether it's a late-inning baseball relief pitcher or a hard­hitting linebacker. Jock Mutschler, a tri-captain on the Notre Dame soc­cer team, plays the defensive posi­tion of stopper, and should play a key role ~n Irish soccer fortunes this year. 
"I'm sort of defense-oriented," says Mutschler, "And what the stop­per has to do is mark the center­forward, who is usually the best scorer for the other team. 
Irish coach Dennis Grace feels his 
star fills all the necessary qualifica­
tions to be a successful defensive 
stopper. 
"There are certain qualities you 
look for when you look for a stopper 
back ...," says Grace, "tenacity, 
strength, a never-say-die attitude, a 
very, very high work rate, and a great 
deal of coqcentration. Jock plugs 
right into that description very well. 
"WhenJock was born, I'm sure he 
had stopper across his forehead," 
continues Grace. "He could play ot­
her positions, there's no doubt in my 
mind, but I don't think he could play 
other positions nearly as well as he 
plays the stopper position." 
Although Mutschler is recovering 
from a minor shin bruise suffered in 
the George Mason game, he should 
be in the lineup as the Irish soccer 
team faces Wisconsin-Milwaukee 
tomorrow at 2 p.m. onAlumni Field. 
Wisconsin-Milwaukee has a 2-0 
record so far on the young season, 
with victories against Quincy and 
Tulsa in the Quincy Tournament. 
Grace feels this contest will be anot­
her tough battle since the Panthers 
had a good recruiting year to 
complement an already ex­
perienced squad. To further con­
cern Grace are the facts that the Irish 
have never before defeated the Pan­
thers and that this opponent seems 
determined to regain its status as a 
pePCnnial top-20 contender. 
"They are a balanced offensive 
and defensive team," says Grace. "I 
don't think they'll be as technically 
good as either Virginia or George 
Mason (who handed the Irish losses 
on the recent East coast trip), but 
they'll be very well-coached and I'm 
sure they'll come out playing hard." 
Wisconsin-Milwaukee is the first 
opponent for the Irish from the 
Mideast region. These regional 
games are important because the 
teams that do well in the region will 
receive bids to the NCAA tourna­
ment. 
Mutschler, in particular, is looking 
ahead to these key midwest rivalries. 
"They're going to be real battles," 
says the senior standout. "All these

Midwest teams are pretty evenly­matched." 
It is Grace's hope, though, that Mutschler's work on both ends of the field will be the difference. For although the talented player's reliable defensive play has made him vital to the Irish squad, the senior captain has been also working much on his offensive game this year. 

Jock Mutschler 
"He doesn't see as much of the (offensive) game as we would like right now, but he's improving on it," admits Grace. "Before the season is out he'll be adding a great deal to our offense, without letting his defensive responsibilities fall off at all. He gives opponents fits when he plays against them one-on-one, and he's played well against some of the best players in the country. 
"He does such a good job at what he does that we have to have him play," continues Grace. "The gravy would be if he can give us the of­

fensive thrust and the offensive con­tributions." 
Mutschler echoes Grace's evaluation of his contribution to the team. 
"Probably my weakness would be moving up and getting into the of­fense," he agrees. "(Coach Grace) has worked with me a lot to get me more involved with the offense and make me more aware of the of­fensive scheme of things." 
Chosen captain by his teammates during the summer, Mutschler tries to use his steady style of play as a tool in his role as captain. 
'.'I try to be a good role model on the field as well as off," he admits. "I'm not the rah-rah, aggressive, overzealous type. I try to go up to freshmen and give them a pat on the back instead of screaming to get them motivated." 
In Grace's opinion, Mutschler ful­fills his duties in this respect with the same success that he performs his on-the-field responsibilities. 
"He just wants to go out there and 
do his job and make sure everybody 
else does theirs," says Grace. "He's 
doing a very good job as captain 
right now." 
Still another goal of Mutschler's, 
though, is to improve the "team con­
cept." 
"I want the team to work as a 
cohesive unit," he says. "One of the 
goals as captain is to get the fresh­
men involved and to make sure they 
know they're contributing, and to 
make sure they fit in and adjust well. 
That's a big thing I've really con­
centrated on. 
"We've got five or six freshmen who see playing time," he adds. "We just need time to jell." 

Mutschler hopes that this can oc­cur rapidly, though, since the chal­lenges of the Notre Dame soccer schedule are many and great. 
"It's really exciting because it's not hard to get up for a game anymore," says the veteran Mutschler. "In the past we've had patsy teams. This year we're just_ loaded with powerhouses, and it's really good to challenge yourself each game. It's not hard to get up mentally to play against the best teams. 
"We can't expect to win them all

Irish fans owe Faust a fair shot this season 
In a week, Gerry Faust officially will embark on his fifth season as Notre Dame football coach. His past four seasons have beenfilled with highs and lows, joys and sorrows, and, most ofall, growing pains. 
No one ever said the transition from high school coach to college coach would be an easy one. But Faust swears this is the year everything will come together for both him and the Irish. We will find out whether or not he is right all too soon, as Notre Dame faces a schedule that College and Pro Football Newsweekly has rated the toughest in the na­tion this year. 
Probably every Irish fan is aware of the fact that this is the final year ofFaust's original contract and that the deter­mination ofwhether or not his contract is renewed will be made at the conclusion of the season. Not surprisingly, Faust refuses to discuss anything having to do with his con­tract, instead bubbling with the optimism for which he has come to be known. 
It would be unfair to both him and the team to enter this season with anything but the same optimism. Notre Dame fans owe Faust a fair shot this year, not one fil.led with defeatism. If the Irish win enough, Faust will be back next year as coach. If they don't, things will take care of them­selves. 
Why worry about what might happen next year when this season is right upon us? 
The pressure to produce has always gone hand-in-hand with the job of football coach at Notre Dame, and Faust knew this when he first took the job. He also knows that it is there even more so this season. 
Don't count on the man not being able to withstand that pressure, though. Over the last four seasons, he has endured some ofthe most trying times known to a football coach. He has remained up when almost everyone else was down on him and the team. 
Losing was something he had not knownall too often at Cincinnati's Moel.ler High School, and Faust has come to accept the fact that it is very difficult to go undefeated at the college level (unless you play in the WAC like BYU ). 
Some rabid Notre Dame fans have trouble accepting this fact. Yet, most Irish fans would not ask for an undefeated

season. Instead, what they want is a good season, one where the Irish always put forth their best effort on the playing field. Ifthat happens, fans feel that a major bowl bid will be possible, given the level of talent Notre Dame has been known to recruit. 
As the Irish prepare to open the season with Michigan, there is a certain amount ofspeculation as to what kind of season Notre Dame must have in order for Faust to get his contract renewed. Should the Irish begin the year poorly, the rumor mill will start to roll, but should they open with a couple big wins, expect such talk to be lost in the shuffie as just about everyone rushes to jump on the bandwagon.

Speaking of bandwagons, where are all the Cub fans these days? There were so many of them last season at this time when the Cubs were on their way to winning the NL East. This season, with the Cubs playing sub-.500 baseball and toiling in fifth place, you just don't see too many so, cal.led fans ofthe North Siders. 
Wrigley Field isn't quite packing them in the way it used to, either. Fans who expected to see the Cubs in a stretcli run to the pennant are bewildered by the fact that their favorites are some 18 games out of first. Gone with the Cubs' pennant hopes are all those obnoxious people who tooted the horn ofChicago baseball only 12 months ago. 
Many of the people who suddenly became "fans" last season now have nothing to boast about. The true Cub fans, though, are those who are still going to the games today, despite the fact that Chicago doesn't have a prayer in the 1985 season as far as winning the NL East goes. In all likelihood, those fans are the same ones who were Cub fans even before last season. 
Expect to see a good-sized crowd wnight at 7:30 in the ACC when the Notre Dame volleyball team opens its season against Kentucky. Although the match is certain to be a good one, the uncertainty lies in where it will be played. 
Because an area near center court of the ACC's main arena has been found to be warped, the Irish may be forced to play in the ACC Pit. The volleyball team played there for most ofits first four years at the varsity level, then moved to the main arena full-time last season. The Pit is not nearly as wel.l suited to volleyball as the main arena is, nor does it hold anywhere near the same number ofpeople. 
Because it is the opener and Kentucky is a national vol­leyball power, tonight's match is likely to draw a big crowd, which could wreak havoc should it be played in the Pit. There is not all that much room for spectator seating in the Pit . 
Determination as to whether or not the volleyball team will be able to play in the main arena was not going to be made until sometime late last night. Since it was dis­covered last week that the floor was warped, four large fans have been blowingon the affected area in an effort to dry it out. 
If the boards had dried out and gone down enough by last night, the plan was to sand them down flat and play tonight's match there. If not, it's back to the pit for the volleyball team. 
The warping is thought to have been caused by either a leaking sauna display at the mobile home show held in the ACC this summer or by water simply dripping in recently while repairs to the roof were taking place. No matter, ex­perts have looked at the area, but it hasn't been determined yet as to whether or not some boards may have to be replaced.
