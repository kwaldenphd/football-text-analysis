Undercover officers crack down on ticket scalpers on campus 

By KENDRA MORRILL Senior Staff Reporter 
As a consequence of the newly implemented ban on ticket scalping, approximately 60 football tickets were confis­cated by police and Notre Dame Security this weekend as "scalpers" attempted to sell the tickets above face value, said Director of Promotions Bubba Cunningham. 
The ticket office also learned the seat locations of about 40 more tickets that were being scalped, said Cunningham. 
Fourteen undercover agents, a combination of Notre Dame Security and city and county police officers, patrolled the campus this weekend looking for people selling tickets above face value, according to Rex Rakow, director of Notre Dame Security. 
"<The agents would) wait for people to approach them or they'd overhear conversa­tions," said Rakow. "Or they'd have conversations with people, and when it turned to the point where the people of­fered them tickets, (the offi­cers> would inform those making the offer that they were agents of the University and that they (making the offer) were violating University reg­ulations," he said. 
If the tickets were ex­changed, said Rakow, then they were confiscated. If the tickets were just offered, the section, row and seat number were recorded, he said. 
This operation would not con­stitute entrapment, Rakow said. "We're not enforcing any criminal law," he said. "We're enforcing University policy on private property. As the prop­erty owners, we have the right to do that." 
The athletic department is planning to contact all people. who owned tickets that were on the market, said Rakow. Those people will be informed that their tickets were being sold above face value and that this is against University policy, he said. 
Cunningham said the Univer­sity hasn't done anything but confiscate and record tickets that were being scalped. 
"The athletic department and the University administra­tion will have to sit down and decide what to do with the scal­pers and the tickets that have been confiscated," he said. 
No penalties for those caught scalping tickets have been set up yet because "we didn't know what we would find (this weekend)," Cunningham said. 
"A student is probably in more trouble than a non­University person because scalping isn't illegal but is against University regula­tions," he added. 
Rakow said he didn't know yet whether any Notre Dame students were caught scalping tickets. 
The ban on ticket scalping was implemented this fall by the University. Scalping is not against Indiana law. 
Cunningham said earlier this month that individuals who had extra tickets could turn them in at the Gate 14 ticket window. The University would then at­tempt to resell those tickets at face value two hours prior to kickoff.

The Notre Dame Monogram Club officially dedicated the Sports Heritage Hall in the con­course of the Joyce ACC on Sat­urday. 
"Our job is an enjoyable one,'' said Notre Dame Athletic Director Richard Rosenthal. "We are here to bless and ded­icate this hall. Of course it's a facility; of course it's an ex­hibit. But it's so much more. It's the recognition and memorialization of many many hundreds of athletes who meant something special to the spirit of Notre Dame."

The Notre Dame sports less frequently in the spotlight are also represented by a lacrosse stick from the first Irish team and a portrait of Pan American Games gold medalist and 1988 Notre Dame graduate Molly Sullivan.

IN BRIEF 
The Children's Museum sent its 2,500-year-old mummy to the hospital Saturday to learn more about the ancient woman who recently filled in some of his­tory's blanks. During her visit to Indiana University Hospital, Wenu-hotep got her picture taken with a three-dimensional CT scan that provided a never­before-seen view of her face. "We found much finer pictures than I would have expected of the bones.... These were incredibly clear and detailed images of the skull, the tissues, the internal bones of the skull," said Robert Pickering, curator of anthropol~gy for the museum. Before the new technology became available, such information could be gained only by destroying the mummy. -Associated Press 
Most teachers feel left out of critical decisions affecting classroom life, except for choosing texts and shaping curriculum, according to a nationwide poll released Saturday. Ten percent or fewer of 21,698 public school teachers surveyed by the Carnegie Foun­dation for the Advancement of Teaching felt they had any say in issues like teacher evaluation or selection of new teachers and administrators. Just 20 percent believed they were influential in tailoring school budgets. On the positive side, 79 percent of those sur­veyed said they felt involved in choosing textbooks and instructional materials, and 63 percent said they had a say in shaping the curriculum. -Associated Press

Notre Dame pushing 'champagne suites'? 
<This column is the result of a friend's tip, so let me give credit where credit is due: Thanks, C.L.) 
Do any of you have your Student Business 
-Directories handy? Remember those yellow books they handed out at registration? You might turn to page 12 for an example of Notre Dame's never-ending quest for social alterna­tives to the alcohol policy. 
''The Ritz: Perfect for Honeymoons, Anniver­saries, Birthdays, Etc," says the advertise­ment. Below is a list of amenities like "heart­shaped whirlpool baths" and "queen size waveless waterbeds," along with two coupons for a 50 percent discount on any weekday over­night stay in a "champagne suite" 
Well, they also offer "tours daily." So I went down to The Ritz yesterday to check the place out. It unfortunately is a bit farther than Motel 6 or Days Inn, but is well worth it. 
Two things tipped me off to the nature of this "establishment" before I even walked in the door. One was the phone number, which spells out BUY LOVE. The other was the door itself, which could not be entered until I pressed a buzzer and someone came to look me over, probably to make sure I wasn't a cop. 
Mter I was let in and my eyes had adjusted to the extremely dim lighting, I asked to take the tour. I was ushered through the 18-room hotel, and told that it was a good idea to call ahead at least two weeks in advance for weekend stays. 
I also snagged a brochure, which billed The Ritz as "A private facility dedicated to romance and intimacy • • • An atmosphere of spe­cial sharing, a romantic retreat, a time to be long remembered, just the two of you • • • at The Ritz." 
The most basic room available is the "Ritz Suite," furnished with a bed. That's it. The bed is nice, queen-sized and semi-waveless and equipped with an excellent stereo in the head­board. The walls are carpeted and the ceiling is mirrored. The mirrors are "bronze-tinted," I was informed by the tour guide. 
According to the brochure, the bathroom is furnished with "disposable razor, shaving cream, body lotion, shampoo, shoeshine cloth, etc." I would imagine "etc." includes condoms but I did not see them myself. The television in each room shows "selected adult movies" as well. 
The champagne suites have the same stuff plus a heart-shaped whirlpool bath. ''Just like a Jacuzzi," said my tour guide. 
Then there are the Penthouse Suites, which offer cathedral ceilings, built-in bars, and a sep­arate "love seat/conversation area." As if

News Editor 

someone staying here would be interested in conversation. On the whole, the place was quite nice for the type of clientele it is trying to cater to. 
Now for the bad news: they only allow single or double occupancy. No exceptions. Well, I sup­pose you could sneak two more in through the window. 
But for those of us who are budget-conscious, The Ritz offers "four-hour getaway rates" which are roughly half of the overnight rates. With the 50 percent coupon offered in the Notre Dame Student Business Directory, even the most broke student can afford The Ritz. Just think how cheap this would be if it were split two ways. 
Well, far be it from me to call the adminis­tration hypocritical for advertising this place themselves while banning alcohol advertising in The Observer. Actually, I'm sure this ad was run with the intent of providing reasonable al­ternatives to alcohol. So let's all go to places like The Ritz for "romance and intimacy." The administration seems to prefer that to having a beer or two.

Parliament calls for open elections in Burma 
Associated Press 
RANGOON, Burma-Parlia­ment on Sunday yielded to weeks of massive nationwide protests and approved holding the first multiparty elections since 1960. 
The legislature appointed a group of elders to supervise the polling and set a target date for about three months from Sat­urday, when President Maung Maung announced the ruling Burma Socialist Program Party would relinquish its 26­year monopoly on power. 
Despite government conces­sions, opposition leaders con­tinued to press for an interim government to cope with Burma's growing chaos, and demonstrations continued in the capital. 
Maung Maung issued a stern warning tb demonstrators, who have taken to the streets by the millions since spring in their fight for democracy. 
"People are now fed up with this lawlessness and are ex­effective action,'' Maung Maung said. "I therefore warn those responsible for the law­lessness to cease such activi­ties." 
In some areas of Burma, he said, students and Buddhist monks were setting up rival local governments, creating "a grave and dangerous situation for those responsible." 
He called on demonstrators to get back to work and on civil servants to reactivate the stalled machinery of govern­ment. In addition, he attacked the recent formation of a. rival government by former Prime Minister U Nu. 
Maung Maung called Sun­day's decision "a milestone in Burmese history." 
"It will be evident in 20 years' time whether the deci­sion was correct or not," he told the 489-member Parlia­ment. 
While authorizing elections in about three months, Parlia­ment also held out the possibil­ity that they could be postponed 

Parliament empowered the Council of State, the highest government organ, to change the Constitution to permit a multiparty system, enlarge the Elections Commission if neces­sary and formulate election rules. 
Named to the Elections Su­pervision Commission were three retired civil servants, a retired army brigadier general and a former member of Par­liament. The men, all over 70, are generally regarded as neutral, although not espe­cially prominent. At least four are not members of the ruling party. 
The Parliament session was held under tight security, and delegates slept in the building Saturday night. The area was cordoned off with barbed-wire fences and road blocks manned by troops. 
Maung Maung urged Burma's 22 million voters to "use their potent weapon--the vote--to choose the right rep­

Class of 1992 minority enrollment hits 13 percent 
Associated Press 
SOUTH BEND-A $12 million endowment has helped boost minority enrollment in the Uni­versity of Notre Dame's fresh­man class to record levels this fall. 
Kevin Rooney, director of ad­missions, said 13 percent of the 1988 freshman class are mem­bers of a minority, compared with 11 percent last year and 9 percent in 1986. 
University President Ed­ward Malloy and Provost Timothy O'Meara have said they would like a 15 percent minority enrollment in the freshman class of 1992. 
Rooney said the $12 million financial aid endowment for minority students was key to this year's increased enroll­ment. "If we're going to con­tinue this, we'll need more in­fusions of this money," he said. 
The university also funds eight one-year fellowships for minorities, including three for black students and five for Hispanic students. 
Two new black faculty mem­bers were named to the school of Arts and Letters, and admi­nistrators have said two more minority professors will be added to the faculty each in the schools of business administra­tion, law and engineering.

WASHINGTON-The head of the nation's space flight pro­gram cautioned yesterday that NASA might not be able to launch space shuttle Discovery on the first attempt late this month. 
"I think that when we get do get to a launch date on the lat­ter part of this month, it wouldn't surprise me at all if it took us two or three times to get airborne," said Rear Adm. Richard Truly, the head of the shuttle program. 
administrator for space flight, said that if ~wo recent success­ful simulations of crew and launch systems had been the real thing, a launch would not have taken place because of weather and winds. 
"We're going to wait until we have it right, and then we're going to do it," said Truly, a two-time shuttle astronaut. "I think the American people ex­pect that of us and that's what we're going to do." 
"It will be the last week in September unless there is a hic­cup," he said. 

"This Week with David Brinkley," '!'ruly shied away from revealing a date for the launch of the first shuttle since the Challenger exploded on )if­toff in January 1986, except to say it probably will be late in September. 
He said there has been no ad­ministration pressure to have the shuttle program restart before the election for whatever political advantage that might give to George Bush.

Hatian gunmen massacre churchgoers 

Associated Press 
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti­

Men armed with guns and mac­
hetes burst into the church of 
a militant Roman Catholic 
priest yesterday and killed at 
least three parishioners, 
wounded 60 and burned down 
the building, witnesses and 
news reports said. 
Police stood near the church, 

but none came to the rescue, 
witnesses said. Mter the at­
tack, gangs of men roamed the 
streets and stoned the offices 
of two groups opposed to the 
military regime of Lt. Gen. 
Henri Namphy. 
The Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aris­

tide, an outspoken opponent of 
the military government, had 
just begun a 9 a.m. (9 a.m. 
EDT) mass when a group of 
men began throwing rocks at 
the church, panicking 
hundreds inside who rushed for 
the doors, said a foreign jour­
nalist attending the service. 
"Suddenly the doors at the back of the church burst open and 20 to 30 men with mac­hetes, huge sticks and guns came in. They were dressed in civilian clothes," said the jour­nalist, who contacted The As­sociated Press in New York by telephone. 
"They started shooting people, beating them, and stab­bing and slashing them," the reporter said. "They stabbed a woman who was pregnant. They stabbed another man who ran outside the church. He died. Some people were shot." 
Estimates of the numbers of parishioners in the church ranged from 600 to 1,500. 
The journalist, speaking on condition of anonymity, said at least three parishioners were killed. Parishioners sur­rounded and protected Aris­tide, who was uninjured. 
Radio Haiti-Inter reported 60 people suffering from gunshot wounds and machete slashes were being treated at the public general hospital. 
Firefighters responded around 10 a.m., but the fire gutted the modest cement­block church and the roof col­lapsed before the blaze was ex­tinguished. 
Aristide is one of the most popular opposition leaders in Haiti. There have been several attempts on his life blamed on forces loyal to the government.

The scheduled appearance Tuesday of Dr. Theodore Cooper, CEO of Up­john, at the Notre Dame Law School should be of grave concern to all those who cherish and respect basic human rights. Though Dr. Cooper will be here to talk about the AIDS crisis, the activ­ities of the company he leads cannot be divorced from him. Making an accom­modation for him tells people everywhere that even though his com­pany plays an active role in the killing of thousands of preborn babies every year, he will be be held accountable for his and his company's actions; indeed, we will ignore these unpleasant facts and welcome him into "civilized" soci­ety. 
Keith Rothfus 
guest column 

The Upjohn company has been at the forefront of the development and dis­tribution of chemicals known as pros­taglandins which are used to destroy human life in its more vulnerable state: the womb. Further, Upjohn has contin­ued to market the dangerous drug Depo-provera in the Third World even though it has not been approved for use in the U.S. For those not familiar with these assaults against humanity, a review of the record is in order. 
What are prostaglandins? Pros­taglandins are hormone-like sub­stances which cause, in the words of abortion authority Dr. J. C. Wilke, ''powerful and sustained contractions of the uterus (labor), at any stage of pregnancy, resulting in vaginal delivery of whatever size baby the mot­her carries. In early pregnancy the drug always kills the baby. In mid­
pregnancy, the baby is sometimes born alive--' a complication.''' 
Upjohn was the pioneer in developing these drugs for pregnancy termination. According to a company pamphlet, "(the) company undertook develop­ment of abortion-inducing drugs be­cause it had a medical obligation to the 
Upjohn CEO: an abortion profiteer 
physician who had decided, with the pa­tient, that a second-trimester abortion was to be performed." Three Upjohn products were approved as abortifa­cients in the U.S.: Prostin F2 alpha, an intra-amniotic injection to be used on mothers in the 16th to 20th week of preg­nancy; Prostin E2, a vaginal sup­pository to be used in the 12th to 20th week of a baby's gestation; and Pros­tin15M, an intramuscular injection, which is to be used anywhere between the 13th and 20th weeks of gestation. Though the marketing of Prostin F2 al­pha has been stopped in the U.S., Up­john continues to market the other two domestically, and all three are ex­ported to the Third World. It is to be noted th.at two percent of the abortions in America are done using prostaglan­dins; that's 30,000 a year, 82 a day, or 12 every hour. 
Upjohn's abortion imperialism does not end with the exportation of pros­taglandins. Depo-Provera is an injec­table "contraceptive" used mainly in the Third World to produce periods of "infertility" in women for up to three months. It is quite possible that the drug acts as an abortifacient itself, flushing newly conceived human embryos through the mother's womb. Regardless of the nature of the drug, it produces serious side effects--serious enough that the U.S. Food and Drug 
"The Upjohn company has been at the fore­front of the development and distribution of chemicals ... which are used to destroy human life in its most vulnera­ble state: the womb." 
Administration has not even allowed testing of the drug on humans in the 
U.S. This does not stop Upjohn from pushing the drug elsewhere. J. Braith­waithe writes "Huge quantities are being dumped on the Third World. Throughout Central America one can

walk into a pharmacy and purchase Depo-Provera without a prescription." Pro-life groups are not the only ones criticizing this practice; feminists and health activists have also added their voices of opposition. Regardless, Up­john hopes to market this poison statewide. 
The officers of Upjohn must accept responsibility for their company's in­ternational assault of humanity. Unfor­tunately, the CEO of Upjohn, Dr. Theodore Cooper, reasserted the com­pany's commitment of supplying abortion-producing drugs after being questioned on the topic by a stockholder at the May 17, 1988, annual stock­holder's meeting in Kalamazoo, Mic­higan. Given the commitment of Up­john's officers to continue their company's killing, it is clearly inappro­priate for any of them to speak at any kind of forum on the campus of a Cath­olic university. 
Lest anyone think this is a call for a litmus test for speakers on this campus, it is not. A university is to be a forum for open discussion. A line must be drawn, however, when an invitation has been extended to one whom has taken an active part in making decisions that enable our pre born brothers and sisters to be killed. Dr. Cooper is not merely a pro-choice advocate, he is an abortion profiteer. Could not another person, as qualified to speak on the topic of AIDS as Dr. Cooper apparently is, have been found that does not carry the baggage that Dr. Cooper does? f

P.O. Box Q 
Military science complies with faith 
Dear Editor: 
I read with considerable interest Mr. Michael Garvey's letter of Sept. 2 con­cerning Major Lindsey's column of Aug. 26. 
I do not believe that the presence of ROTC on campus is inappropriate nor do I believe that military science will always be profoundly at odds with my faith. The purpose of ROTC programs is to train leaders for our military units which will protect our country. I see nothing wrong with the recent examina­tion and report on the ethical aspects of ROTC and would not object to a similar examination of the Department of Public Relations. 
I do believe that it is quite possible for a person to be a member of the mil­itary or a memeber of the Department of Public Relations and still be a son or daughter of the same father. Indeed, a person could even be an Assistant Dean or a faculty member and main­tain the same relationship. 
I hope that Mr. Garvey is not on the same committee which reports to St. Peter when I apply for acceptance.

DUI sign needs to be relocated 

Dear Editor: 
The other day, as I was leaving campus in my car through the north gate, I noticed a sign dedicated to the memory of Michael Cogswell, a victim of drunken driving. Of course I feel that such a sign is an excellent idea, but one thought came to mind: what is it doing there? Every day professors and Uni­versity employees who leave through the north gate are reminded of the tragedy of Michael's death, but this message is not primarily directed towards them. It was erected last year to remind the students of Notre Dame of the horrible consequences of drink­ing while intoxicated. While I realize that there isn't much of it running around on campus, I feel that it is time for those in charge to use some common sense, for a change. Why not move the sign across from the D2 parking lot, where students will see it as they are migrating off-campus and will be reminded of the tragedies that drinking and driving can cause. In its present location I do not see how it can help, so move it. Who knows, it may even do some good.

Notre Dame Encounter Uplifting 
DAN STRUTZEL accent writer 
Notre Dame Encounter'? What's that'? Wait a minute, is that one of those retreats where everyone sits around and talks about God'? It's not too personal is it'? Is it co-ed? Why do I need to have an encounter with Christ anyway'? 
Notre Dame-Saint Mary's students who have seen table tents, posters, and newspaper ads for Notre Dame Encounter for the past year and a half have been asking these ques­tions over and over again. The idea of a retreat to deepen one's personal, spiritual, and social awareness seems interesting, while at the same time, very intimidating. 
Howev~r, as many past par­ticipants, team members, and campus ministers would attest, the Notre Dame Encounter with Christ Program is one of the most unique and powerful experiences that the campus has to offer. 
Jim Wimbiscus, a graduate of Notre Dame and Encounter team member said, "It's a campus-wide retreat program that allows people from all dorms and classes to gather to­gether and experience one an­other, members of the faculty and staff, and most important­ly, Christ. Notre Dame Encounter breeds a sense of unity and support on campus." 
The mission statement of NDE provides a good outline for how the program intends to foster this unity: "NDE calls one to a personal gospel com­

mitment: to be a witness to one's covenant with God. NDE develops this commitment in a communal process. NDE hopes to enlighten, affect, and inspire the participants to live as Christians in the world. NDE aspires to be a vehicle for God's call to covenant and communi­ty." 
NDE acts as this vehicle through a two-fold process: 1) A three day weekend retreat in which every participant is called to focus on issues con­cerning self-knowledge and awareness, one's friendship with God, and one's responsi­bility to the community. 2) A follow-up program in which 
.... _,.,.,., 

former retreat participants continue to enhance personal and spiritual development through prayer, discussion and reflection. 
Through this two-pronged program, NDE hopes to be a comforting guide to a fruitful spiritual life for students. Fa­ther Paul Holland SJ, a PhD. student and campus minister for NDE, highlights three aspects of the program which are integral in one's faith de­velopment. 
"NDE is a profound experi­ence in being loved and ac­cepted by God and others," said Holland, "Secondly, it is an expansion of horizons that retreatants glimpse the needs of the campus and the world and the ability to respond to those needs. Finally, NDE gives one the power to respond by sharing the spirit in one's life with others." 
The love and acceptance amongst all the NDE partici­pants are two of the hallmarks of the program. This spirit en­courages long-term friendships and contacts throughout one's years at Notre Dame or Saint Mary's and beyond. It also pro­vides an atmosphere where one can bring hisner concerns, joys, or frustrations and be sure that they will be heard. 
Seniors find NDE an excel­lent way to integrate their pres­ent personal and spiritual lives before they leave Notre Dame. Freshmen often look to NDE as a way to take a responsible first step in their personal faith development. Whatever the reason, NDE fosters a com­munal atmosphere where people can talk about and respond to issues together. 
''The response to the Encounter from students shows that there is a need for it on campus. There's a need to have a more mature response to Christianity. This comes from making one's faith more personal, rather than merely making it a creed," said Brother Bonaventure Scully, rector of Keenan Hall and a member of the NDE board. 
"NDE makes faith more per­sonal by adding the communal aspect." Scully added, "Par­ticipants begin to see Christi­anity as a part of one large fam­ily." NDE hopes to expand its family of participants in the fu­ture by offering six to eight retreats a year (four are of­fered now) and implementing an alumni encounter for re­turning graduates. 
Just as one may have many questions about the idea of NDE, one also has unanswered questions and uncertainties about hisner faith. Conversely, just like faith, the whole expe­rience of NDE can never be fully explained or described. What NDE does have to offer is a chance to grow in one's per­sonal journey of self -discovery and spirituality, and to affirm one's faith in a communal process. Where one's journey will proceed from there depends on one's willingness to explore.

ROSE HERRMANN accent writer 
This fall there is a new face 
circulating among the faculty 
of the College of Arts and Let­
ters. Visiting from Virgina 
Tech, Professor Donald V. 
Stump will be spending a se­
mester at Notre Dame teach­
ing two classes in the Program 
of Liberal Studies. 
This semester, Stump is 
teaching a junior-level Great 
Books Seminar and a sopho­
more tutorial, Language and 
Poetry. 
Originally from Wyoming, 
Stump obtained his bachelor of 
arts degree in English at Grin­
nell College in Iowa, a liberal 
arts school of about 1200 stu­
dents. It was the Great Books 
courses Stump took at Grinnell 
that first interested him in 
teaching. He was excited and 
intrigued by the variety of 
world views he was exposed to 
in these classes and wanted to

tion at Cornell University, where he completed his masters and doctoral degrees specializing in the English Re­naissance. Because an under­standing of the works of a wide cross section of periods was vi­tal in understanding the Re­naissance, he was able to make extensive use of his Great Books background. 
Stump's professional career began with a year of teaching at Colgate. He moved on to Vir­ginia Tech where he has spent the past nine years as a faculty member in the English depar­tment. 
Stump became interested in teaching at Notre Dame when his wife--also a faculty mem­ber at Virgina Tech--received a senior fellowship to conduct research at the University in Philosophy of Religion. He has his involvement in the Pro­gram of Liberal Studies at Notre Dame because of its structured curriculum. Begin­ning in the sophomore year, the backbone of the Program of Liberal Studies is a series of seminars which progresses chronologically. This format enables the students to, "learn in a clear historical order," ac­cording to Stump. 
Since the students have already studied Aristotle's phi­losophy in a previous seminar, they can broaden that under­standing in later seminars which compare Aristotle's views to those of other authors. 
"Liberal Arts approaches education as the development of the whole person," said Stump, "Instead of training students for particular

careers, liberal arts teaches them a balanced variety of sub­jects. Consequently they are able to develop a full range of intellectual potentials." 
According to Stump, people often base their views and as­sumptions about the world only on their own immediate culture in more career-oriented forms of education. They do not rec­ognize that their perceptions may be "distorted by the limitations of a particular time and place." 
Stump views the Program of Liberal Studies as an opportu­nity to study several cultures over many centuries, recogniz­ing the best aspects of each. 
This broadens the students' perspectives and enables them to be more objective about their own culture. 
The students that Stump has encountered at Notre Dame seem to be devoted to this con­cept of broad education. "They are excited about what they are learning. They want to partic­ipate in class and are well prepared with good answers." he said. 
After completing his semes­ter at Notre Dame, Stump will spend the following months working on a book on tragedy and epic. He plans to return to teaching at Virginia Tech in the fall.

UCLA tops Nebraska; Mich. St. upset 
Associated Press 
A hot first quarter left UCLA coach Terry Donahue with a warm feeling. 
"The fans were on fire, the team was on fire, everything was clicking, everything was working," Donahue said after his fifth-ranked Bruins scored 28 points in the first quarter and upset second-ranked Ne­braska 41-28 Saturday. 
"That was the best quarter of football I've seen in my ten­ure at UCLA," said Donahue, who earned his 100th victory since becoming the Bruins' head coach in 1976. 

Troy Aikman threw three first-quarter touchdown passes, including two to Charles Arbuckle, as UCLA avenged three losses to the Cornhuskers in the last five years. 
In another clash of ranked teams, Reggie Ho kicked the last of a school-record four field goals with 1: 13 left to give No. 13 Notre Dame a 19-17 victory over No. 9 Michigan. 
The only ranked team to lose to an unrated school was No. 15 Michigan State, beaten 17-13 by Rutgers. 
In other games involving the Top Ten, it was No.3 Clemson 23, Furman 3; No.4 Oklahoma 28, North Carolina 0; No. 6 Southern California 24, Stan­ford 20; No. 7 Auburn 20, Ken­tucky 10; No. 8 Georgia 38, Texas Christian 10, and No. 10 Florida State 49, Southern Mis­sissippi 13. 
In the Second Ten, it was No. 12 West Virginia 45, Fullerton St. 10, No. 14 Alabama 37, Temple 0; No. 16 South Carolina 38, Western Carolina 0; No. 17 Iowa 45, Kansas St. 10; No. 18 Penn State 42, Vir­ginia 14, and No. 20 Washington 20, Purdue 6. 
Rutgers 17, Mich. St. 13 
Scott Erney completed 25 of 36 passes for 239 yards and two touchdowns, and Doug Kokoskie had a key fumble recovery as Rutgers stunned the defending Big Ten and Rose Bowl champions. 
Kokoskie's fumble recovery killed a fourth-quarter drive by Michigan State after the Spar­tans had moved 50 yards to the Rutgers 15. On first down, Blake Ezor, who gained 196 yards on 33 carries, was tackled for a 1-yard loss. Ezor ran right for six yards on the next play, but fumbled the ball. 
Clemson 23, Furman 3 

Tailback Terry Allen scored two touchdowns and freshman Chris Gardocki kicked three field goals for Clemson, 2-0. 
The Tigers struggled on an overcast afternoon at Clemson, S.C., in beating Furman, 1-1, an NCAA Division 1-AA team that had entered the game with a 3-1-1 record since 1982 against Atlantic Coast Conference teams.

Women's to Hoyas 
By MARY GARINO Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's cross country team opened its third varsity season on Satur­day by facing a strong Geor­getown team. Although the Irish were not intimidated, they were not solid enough to topple the Hoyas, who defeated the Irish by a final score of 21­
38. 
Georgetown took seven of the top 10 spots in the race. Elizabeth Brendan and Chris Brough, both from Geor­getown, placed first and second with respective times of 18: 36 and 18:54. Notre Dame's first three finishers were freshman Lucy Nusrala (third), senior Theresa Rice (fifth) and senior Terry Kibelstis (seventh). A group of Irish runners filled all the last eight places. 
"I was a little disappointed that nobody emerged from the pack to be fourth, fourth fifth, sixth and seventh," said Irish

Irish  sophomore  Jenny  

Ledrick, who Connelly was hoping would be the team's fourth runner, was held out be­cause of a slight injury. Con­nelly didn't want to risk her in the season's first meet. 
Connelly was pleased with the performance of his top three finishers. 

"We knew that we had three that could run with anyone and they did," he said. "I was really happy with Lucy and Theresa. And Terry ran great. Overall, we ran well." 
The Irish next will compete in the National Catholics, which Notre Dame will host on Sept. 30. Connelly predicts at least a fifth place finish from among the approximately 20 teams competing. Rice, the Notre Dame captain, backed this up. 
"We'll run more competi­tively I'm sure," she said.

''Our football team answered the challenge every time,'' said Holtz, whose squad trailed 14­13 and 17-16 before it was over. "I thought it was one great foot­ball game. Our defense played exceptionally well. We were as physical as I thought we would be."

The world according to Ho 
By MARTY STRASEN Sports Editor 
Walk-on placekicker Reggie Ho not only im­pressed Notre Dame fans with his poise and accuracy, but also impressed many members of the media with his humility in answering post-game questions. 
• On the pressure of his 26­yard game-winning field goal: 
"Nobody was going to hit me, so I wasn't too ner­vous." 
• On the possibility of receiv­ing a football scholarship in the future: 
"They've given me the op­portunity to play football for Notre Dame. There's no way I'm going to take money from them. They've given me enough already. The privilege of kicking here ts all I want." 
• On being tossed around by his teammates after field goals: 
"Sure, I feel it. But as long as we get the momentum going for the team, they can hit me as hard as they want." 
• On the decision to play foot­ball in the spring of 1987, after spending his first two years at Notre Dame con­centrating on his pre-med studies:

Graf takes Grand Slam 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK--It took 18 years for tennis to get another Grand Slam winner. The next wait could be much shorter. 

Minutes after Steffi Graf completed the Slam with a vic­tory over Gabriela Sabatini at the U.S. Open Saturday, some people were predicting the 19­year-old West German might sweep the four major tourna­ments again next year. 
"It's a tough assignment, but she's such a good player and she's so strong and determined that it's definitely possible," said CBS commentator Tony Trabert, who won five Grand Slam tournament singles titles in the 1950s. 
"I think her biggest potential threat is Wimbledon. Grass is her least favorite surface be­cause she takes such a big swing and because of the bad footing." 
Billie Jean King, who won 12 Grand Slam tournament singles titles, also thinks Graf can become the first player to win consecutive Grand Slams. 
"She has the determination to be a great champion, the po­tential to be one of the best ever," King said. 
"Steffi beat all the top players in all four tourna­ments. And she looks like she might be able to do it some more." 
King said Graf's feat was more difficult than the first five 
Slams: Don Budge in 1938, Maureen Connolly in 1953, Rod 

Laver in  1962 and 1969,  and  
Margaret Court in 1970.  
"It's  more  impressive  now  

because all the best players go to all the Grand Slams," King said. 
"When I was playing, you would skip the Australian a lot and not even go to the French all the time. The clay courts were so different for us, and Australia meant going away for three months."
