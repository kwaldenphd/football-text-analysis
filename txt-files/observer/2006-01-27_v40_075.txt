Like a fairy tale, time spent studying abroad is a pnriod of ineredible adventure and growth for many students ­eomplete with kings, queens and eastles. But as is some­times the ease in these dassic stories, venturing off the familiar path can have unex­pectedly dangerous results. 
Notre Dame has been eonsis­tently praised for the strength of its oversnas programs. ranking fifth among American researeh universities for the pereentage of students study­ing abroad in the most recent report issued by the Institute for International Education, and even higher in previous years. So, with over 1,000 stu­dents abroad almost every school year, the University bears a great responsibility in ensuring the health and wel­fare of participants in 17 countries across the globe. 

"During such a turbulent and important period in histo­ry, many courageous students are interested in going abroad, and it is essential to balance their safe while promoting 
internationalism," said Julia Douthwaite, director of the Office of International Studies (ISP). 
The greatest threat posed to students abroad, Douthwaite said, is often their own com­placency -in forgetting that activities normal for life in Indiana may warrant more caution for those living over­seas.

Lured by the promise of a discussion with University President Emeritus Father Theodore Hesburgh at the screening of a movie about his life, students flocked to DeBartolo 101 Thursday night, filling the room nearly to eapacity. 
"The event is a tribute to this incredible person who is not only a part of Notre Dame his­tory, but also a part of world history," said Jimmy Flaherty, Student Union Board (SUB) Manager. SUB, in conjunction with Keough Ilall, hosted the event.

Paging Godwin,

ed on line one. 
We all know the next couple of Associate months will be a Photo Editor flamewar of epic pro­portions. Notre Dame students can be evicted from their hous­es for having a party, and most of us don't bat an eyelash; but say "vagina" in public and suddenly it's all hanging from the fan. 
So let's review some of the standards of civilized discourse before donning our asbestos suits, shall we? 
Corollary 1: If, in discussion, a com­parison is made to Hitler or the Nazis, the discussion is generally held to have passed beyond the realm ofuseful dis­course. The participant who made the comparison is, in most traditions, con­sidered to have lost the argument by virtue ofrecourse to irrational appeal. 
Most of us, myseJf included, were told a lot of lies by our history teachers as we grew up. One of those is that everything associated with Nazi Germany is inher­ently evil, down to toothbrush mustaches and Shock and Awe warfare. "Nazi" is our worst insult, on par with "child molester" or "atheist." When we run out of rational things to say, when we are fed up with our opposition, when we just know we are talking to a brick wall, call­ing our interlocutor a Nazi sounds like a progressively better way to fit him or her with the black hat as the length of the discussion approaches, well, infinity. 
Corollary 2: An intramural discussion will observe the fastest growth ofproba­bility ofcomparison to Hitler or Nazis when its topic is perceived institutional core values. 
Corollary 2a: The probability that Hitler or the Nazis will be invoked in a public discussion ofany ofthe following at Notre Dame is equal to one: sex, abor­tion, homosexuality. sex, academic free­dom, the Chicago Cubs, parietals, the appropriateness ofa baccalaureate edu­cation in business and sex. 
Corollary 2b: The probability ofgod­winning a discussion ofsexual morality in open forum at Notre Dame is 3. 
Godwin could be seen sitting in the back row of Fr. Jenkins' addresses this week, muttering to himself. Few others, it seems, noticed, but when Jenkins brought up the Daisenberger passion play (saying that Notre Dame would be forced to forbid a production ofit because of its anti-Semitism), he used as a supporting argument the utterly irrele­vant information that Hitler attended and·praised the play. 
Remind me to send that memo to the music department: all of Wagner is now off-limits. 
Corollary 3: Intentional tripping of Godwin s Law does not end rational dis­cussion by those around you. It only makes you look like an asshat. 
So please, everyone: feel free to love or hate the Queer Film Festival; choose to have a deep and fulfilling dialogue with your vagina, or not to; but leave the Nazi comparisons alone.

Pollee identify body as 15th-century woman 
BREST, France -French police who spent two years trying to identify a woman who was murdered by a blow to the head were relieved to discover the reason their efforts were failing: the woman died half a millennium ago. 
The skeleton of a woman in her 30s was found dur­ing an exceptionally low tide in Dec. 2003 near the seaside Brittany town of Plouezoc'h. A long gash in the skull convinced investi­gators she was killed with a hatchet or other sharp implement. 
Police ploughed through missing persons files to no avail. A theory that the woman was the wife of a Normandy doctor who dis­appeared with his family in a famous 1999 case was dismissed after DNA tests. 
Eventually radiocarbon dating established that the death had occurred between 1401 and 1453. 
"We are satisfied because at least we know the date now, said Francois Gert-hosser of the Plourin-les-Morlaix police. "We reckon it was pirates."

Ramadan sues U.S. over visa 
Scholar seeks to declare Patriot Act unconstitutional 
Associated l'rcss 
t\ loading Muslim scholar who opposes the war in Iraq has sued tlw U.S. government. cl a i rn ing oiTieials used anti­terrorism laws to stop him from ac:eepting speaking invi­tations from organizations. 
In a federal lawsuit filed Wednesday, Tariq Hamadan ac:c:usos the government of manipulating thn Patriot Act to muzzle him. 
In a phone interview with Tho Associated Press, the Swiss intolleetual and Muslim srholar denied that hn sup­ports terrorism. 
"I havn no connnetions to tc~ r ro r ism." Ham ad an said from Oxford. England, where ho is a visiting follow. "This is all about my political thoughts. And my political thoughts are known to ovory­

Hamadan was blocked from accepting a tenured teaching position at tlw University of Notre Damn when his visa was n~vokc~d in August 2004 undor a provision of tho Patriot Act, said .lameel .JaiTor. an ACLU staff attorney.

Hamadan. 43, said he opposed tlw U.S. invasion of Iraq. and sympathizes with the resistance there and in l'alnstine. But he said he also opposes Islamic extremism, and promotes peaceful solu­tions. 
"I want to build bridges," he said. "But I'm not blindly sup­portive of U.S. or European polieies."

NASDAQ creates ND business endovvn1ent 
Special to The Observer 
The Nasdaq Stock Market Educational Foundation Ine. has created a $100,000 endowment at the University of Notre Dame in support of the annual business plan competitions sponsored by thn University's Gigot Center for Entrepreneurial Studies. 
The Nasdaq Educational Foundation Endowment for Excellence will be directed toward the development of a training and networking pro­gram for participants in the Gigot Center's McCloskey Business Plan Competition and Social Venture Plan Competition. 
"We are most appreciative of this generous award, which will allow the managers of' our competitions to devolop a comprehensive program that will help all participants design better business plans," said James Davis, Hay and Milann Siegfried Director of the Gigot Center. 
Thn new program will pro­vide formal training to partic­ipants in the University's two competitions, with the objec­tive of leveling the playing field between individuals with varying degrees of business education. It also is expected that the program will help increase both the quality and quantity of business plan sub­missions. 
"Above all, this program 
will aid in the competitions' ndueational mission," Davis said. "By providing improvod training and nntworking sns­sions, it is morn liknly that people with backgrounds in other disciplines -sueh as theology, physics or pnacn studies -will entnr the com­petitions." 
"Nasdaq has long been identified with entrepreneuri­alism and innovation," said Joan Conley, Corporate Secretary of The Nasdaq Stock Market and The Nasdaq Educational Foundation. "Innovation and nnw business ideas cannot be brought to fruition without a solid busi­ness plan.

before [he] sleep[s]." 
Hesburgh's talk and pres­ence were so successful, according to SUB Concert Programmer Chris Lund, because of universal interest in the highly decorated former University president. 
"Hesburgh is the essence of Notre Dame," Lund said. 
The film's producers fea­tured students and adminis­trators while filming on cam­pus, attempting to incorporate the Notre Dame identity that Hesburgh has helped create. 
The filmmakers also fea­tured famous narrators, including testimony of four former United States presi­dents, Secretary of State and 1975 Notre Dame alumna Condoleezza Rice, and actors Sean Astin, Clarence Gilyard and Regis Philbin. 
Though the film educated students about many biogra­phical details of Hesburgh's life, his onstage presence in the following discussion made obvious his skill at connecting with an audience. Afterwards, senior Andy Burkavage reflected on the experience. 
"Tonight made me aware of how extraordinary his life has been," Burkavage said. "Students generally know what he has done for this school, but to see the level of his statesmanship and [its] international effect was highly impressive." 
The documentary included many details of Hesburgh's 

close work with United States presidents and his huge role on the Civil Rights Commission, as well as stir­ring images such as one of Hesburgh hand-in-hand with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
In the film, Hesburgh down­plays his monumental role in 
civil rights work and other national affairs. He chooses instead to emphasize his role as priest, telling of his personal pledge to celebrate mass every day. He cheerily describes the litany of places in which he has celebrated the liturgy recounting tales of makeshift 

Junior Handy Yang expressed his deep apprecia­tion of this Notre Dame legend and described his special bond with the priest.

masses in such locales as Antarctica, a plane above the Amazon and a submarine in the Pacific Ocean. 
Notre Dame's transforma­tion into a national university during Hesburgh's 35-year tenure is a focal point of the film, which also focuses on Hesburgh's close friendship with Father Edmund P. Joyce, executive vice-president dur­ing Hesburgh's presidency. The audience remained keen­ly engaged by stories and pho­tographs of the pair's travels. 
Curiosity attracted sopho­more Camila Bernal to the event. 
"I am thankful to be here and even more thankful that Father Hesburgh is here with us," Bernal said. 
Hesburgh is a beacon for the University, and it is every stu­dent's dream to meet him," he said. "We were happy to pro­vide this forum for students." 
Steve Tortorello, SUB Ideas and Issues Programmer, stressed that though Hesburgh's legacy is insepara­ble from that of Notre Dame, the value of his presence as a speaker should not be under­estimated. 
"When people think about 'big name speakers,' they often overlook the fact that we are so fortunate to have one of the most important men of the 20th century right here at Notre Dame," Tortorello said.

Saint Mary's women and the Sisters of the Holy Cross. The pro­gram is designed to give students the opportunity to build lasting friendships with older members of the Saint Mary's community. It also allows students to learn about the history of the College, said Sister Louisita Welsh, the pro­gram's faculty advisor. 
'The program that was in place when I arrived here a few years ago was called 'Adopt a Nun,' and was somewhat inconsistent. When I became the program director three years ago, I talked to a group of students, and they want­ed to form something that had some substance to it," Welsh said. "We recreated the program to build another connection between the sisters and the students. The intergenerational relationship was not as strong as it could have been, and we were tempted to strengthen it." 
In the fall of 2003, Welsh and a team of studehts advertised the newly designed Friends with Sisters program and received an overwhelming response. Reinert remembers applying for the pro­gram as a first-year student, and being turned down because the number of student applicants exceeded the number of sisters. 
Approximately 110 students and 100 sisters are involved in the pro­gram this year, Welsh said. Senior Molly Ritter said she acknowl­edges that these members have dilierent needs and said the core leadership team has designed the program to appeal to every mem­ber. 
"Hight now, the program is set up so that students and sisters are able to have one-on-one interac­tion," Hitter said. "However, if a member is uncomfortable with one-on-one interaction, they can sign up to be involved in small or large group activities with other sisters and students." 
These group gatherings have included Halloween parties, Christmas caroling and "Pretzel Pizzaz" parties, which provide the sisters and students with an opportunity to interact with many members of the Saint Mary's com­munity at one time. 
"I think the small and large group activities have really been great icebreakers for the students and sisters who aren't comfortable meeting with each other individu­ally," said sophomore Lesley Weaver, who helps coordinate the events. 
The majority of the members, however, prefer one on one inter­action. and meet with each other individually, student coordinator Monica Lindblom said. 
Lindblom was paired with Sister Leo Nella as a first-year student, and said she loved the alone time they spent together. 
"It's almost like going over to grandma's house when you walk over to the convent," she said. "I always had Wednesday lunch with to do is to sit and listen to her sto­ries. I'm an education major, and I love. to listen to her talk about her experiences as a teacher." 

The students' interest in the sis­ters' stories is an aspect of the program that surprises Sister Joan Elizabeth. 
"The sisters love to reminisce," she said. "And I am so· touched by the students who dedicate their time and listen, quite energetical­ly, to these stories that the sisters tell. Even if the sister tells the same story over and over again, the student is still interested and still listens." 
It is through these stories that students are really able to learn from the sisters, Welsh said. 
"As in most relationships, as you continue to grow in that relation­ship, you want to know the history of the other," she said. "In our case, the student wants to know the history of the sister and her connection with Saint Mary's. The history then, lies in that story that we often don't take time anymore to grasp." 
Sister Joan Elizabeth said she also wants to emphasize the histo­ry of Saint Mary's, and tries to visit the Heritage Room in the convent with her students. 
"I think there's an opportunity there for understanding the Sisters of the Holy Cross, Saint Mary's College, and also the rela­tionship between Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and Holy Cross College," she said. "There is some­thing to be said for tradition and heritage, and a lot of people today don't have an opportunity to talk with someone who has the history of more than 150 years. This pro­gram offers that link to our com­mon founder." 
The students are not the only ones that gain perspective from the program, however. Many sis­ters say that the students bring new energy and perspective to the sisters as well. 
"(Sister Joan] loves to hear sto­ries about what I do on a day-to­day basis, and she's always inter­ested what's evolving at the College," Reinert said. "I am her eye into campus life." 
Like Reinert, Weaver said she thinks the presence of students at the convent gives the sisters a fresh perspective.

sation with Sister Joan Elizabeth, Reinert realized that she had more in common with the sister than she thought -Sister Joan knew Sister Agnes Eugene, the relative Reinert had heard and wondered so much about. 
"I couldn't believe it when she told me she knew Sister Agnes," Reinert said. "They weren't great friends, but Sister Joan said that she knew her and that she was one of the nicest people she'd ever met. It's neat because now I have that link to Sister Agnes that I did­n't think I would have." 
This type of connection and link to Saint Mary's history is what the program is all about, Welsh said. She said she has known most of the sisters for many years, ha~ been familiar with the Saint Mary's student body for many years, and is excited about the possibilities for growth and under­standing when you put the two together. 
"You've got the bright young student, and you've got the bright, seasoned, faith-filled woman, and when you put those together, I don't think you can do any better," she said. "You can't have a rela­tionship that is any richer."

Sister Joan Elizabeth said she cannot imagine what the convent would be like without the pres­ence and energy of the students. 
"I think of the Mother Houses who don't have this kind of oppor­tunity with young people and I'm thinking, it must be really dead in those places," she said. "I can't imagine what it would be like to not have the energy that comes from the Saint Mary's students." 
She is careful to add, however, that she does not think one group necessarily benefits from the pro­gram more than the other. 
"It's not one-sided. The sisters aren't the only ones who have something to give, and it's just not the students who have something to give, and we need to realize this and capitalize on each others' strengths," she said. "The more we can continue to look at ways to collaborate, and whatever inter­generational relationships we can build, the stronger the si<;ters will be, the stronger the students will be, and the stronger the College will be."

GM's earnings plummet in 2005 
Associated Press 

DETROIT -General Motors Corp. posted its largest annual loss in more than a decade, laying bare the problems the automaker is facing: rising labor costs, lieree competition from Asia and falling sales at home. ll was another blow for the U.S. auto industry, already reeling from massive job cuts announced this week by Ford Motor Co. 
GM, which could lose its position as the world's largest automaker this year to Toyota Motor Corp., said Thursday it lost $4.8 billion in the fourth quarter and $8.6 billion for all of 2005. That was the worst showing since 1992, when it lost $23.5 billion. 
Sales gains in Asia, Europe and elsewhere were more than oiTset by huge losses in North America, where GM lost $5.6 billion for the year. 
Company executives insist the results will improve in 2006, but GM shares slumped as concerned investors wondered if the company can win customers and extract sufli­cinntly largo concessions from its unions to stop the financial nose­dive. 
"It was surprisingly negative, wnll below the low end of the most pes­simistic analysts, which is no small feat," said Pete Hastings, vice presi­dent of corporate fixed income at tho investment firm Morgan Keegan & Co. "I think you'll see recovery ofT of 2005. But getting bad lo prof­itability in North American opera­tions is a multiyear challenge." 
The eornpany lost $15.13 per share for the year, far more than Wall Stn~et's l'oreeast of a loss of $4.19 per share, aeeording to ana­lysts surveyed by Thomson Finaneial. Worldwidn revnnue of $1<J2.6 billion for tho full ynar was down slightly from 2004.

Oprah rehashes memoir scandal, grills author 
Associated Press 
The story of "A Million Little Pieces" was supposedly over. After all, Oprah had said it was. 
The TV host had belittled all the talk about alleged fabrica­tions as "much ado about noth­ing." Author James Frey had invoked the rights of memoirists to take "liberties." His publisher said the matter wasn't worth looking into. 
And then Oprah Winfrey changed her mind. She had read the angry e-mails, the newspa­per columns and feature stories: Oprah thinks it's OK to lie. Maybe she was wrong to defend her anointed author. It was time to get the facts. So she took on Frey, face to face. 

"I feel duped," she said Thursday on her syndicated talk show to a downcast Frey, who sat next to her. "But more impor­tantly, I feel that you betrayed millions of readers." 
Frey, who found himself booed in the same Chicago studio where he had been embraced not long ago, acknowledged that he had lied. "If I come out of this experience with anything, it's being a better person and learn­ing from my mistakes and mak­ing sure that I don't repeat them," he said. 
Thursday's telecast, rare proof that the fact checking of a book can make for inspired tabloid TV, marked an abrupt reversal from the cozy chat two weeks ago on "Larry King Uve," when Winfrey phoned in to support Frey. 
"I left the impression that the truth does not matter," Winfrey said Thursday of last week's call, adding that "e-mail after e-mail" from supporters of the book had cast a "cloud" over her judg­ment. 
Sometimes angry, sometimes tearful, Winfrey asked Frey why he "felt the need to lie." Audience members often groaned and gasped at Frey's halting, stuttered admissions that certain facts and characters had been "altered" but that the essence of his memoir was real. 
"I don't think it is a novel," Frey said of his book, which had initially been offered to publish­ers, and rejected by many, as fic­tion. "I still think it's a memoir." 
On a segment that also fea­tured the book's publisher, Nan 
A. Talese of Doubleday, Frey was questioned about various parts of his book, from the three-month jail sentence he now says he never served to undergoing den­tal surgery without Novocain, a story he no longer clearly recalls. 
Winfrey subjected Frey to a virtual page-by-page interroga­tion, the kind of review he clearly never received from his publish­er. No longer, as she called into King's show, was she saying that emotional truth mattered more than the facts. "Mr. Bravado Tough Guy," she mockingly called the author, whose book she had enshrined last fall and whose reputation she had recently saved. 
Talese and Doubleday were not spared. Winfrey noted that her staff had been alerted to possible discrepancies in Frey's book, only to be assured by the pub­lisher. She lectured Talese on her responsibilities: ''I'm trusting you, the publisher, to categorize this book whether as fiction or autobiographical or memoir." 
Talese, an industry veteran whose many authors have included Ian McEwan, George Plimpton and Thomas Cahill, told Winfrey that editors who saw the book raised no questions and that "A Million Little Pieces" received a legal vetting. She acknowledged that the book had not been fact-checked, some­thing many publishers say they have little time to do.

California declares secondhand stnoke toxic pollutant 
Link to breast cancer causes state to pass unanimous decision 
Associated Press 
SACHAMENTO, Calif'. ­California hneame the first statn to deelarn sneondhand srnokn a toxie air pollutant Thursday, putting tobaeco fumes in the same eategory as diesel exhaust, arsenic and benzenn beeause of its link to breast eaneer. 
The unanimous decision by thn state Air Hesourees Board reli1~d on a September report that found a sharply inereased risk of breast eaneer in young women exposed to seeondhand smoke. It also links drifting smoke to premature births, asthma and heart disease, as well as other eaneers and numnrous hnalth problems in rhildron. 
"If peopln arn snrious about breast eaneer, they have to dna) with sorondhand smoke. That's what this is all about," said Dr. Stanton c;Iantz, 
That conelusion eonflicts with a 2004 report by the U.S. sur­geon general. Sanford Barsky, a researeher writing on behalf of tho ILl. Heynolds tobacco company, told the board in pre­vious testimony that the state report "either ignores mention­ing or dons not give the appro­priate weight" to studies refut­ing a link between seeondhand smoke and breast cancer. 
California scientists say their research is more eurrent than the surgeon general's report. The state report went through an exhaustive review that delayed its release for nearly a year but ensures it is based on sound research, said Dr. John Froines, director of UCLA's Center for Occupational and Environmental Health and head of the sdentific review panel. 
ILl. Heynolds spokesman David lloward said regardless of' the dangers from passive smoke indoors, no researeh supports rogulators' decision to deelare it an air pollutant. 
"No studies exist that show that exposure outdoors leads to any inereased risk of tobacco­

The group may also seek nonsmoking floors or wings in apartment buildings, much as hotels offer smoke-free areas, he said.

Make 'conversation' real 
He didn't owe us this. 

Father John Jenkins doesn't need-and doesn't pretend to seek -majority approval for his stance on academic freedom and Catholic character at Notre Dame. Jenkins earned the con­sensus he needed to make decisions on April 30, 2004, the day that the Board of Trustees elected him University president. 
With the trustees' mandate, the philosopher-priest from · Omaha, Neb. could have steered Notre Dame by his will alone. 
But this week, in a series of addresses constituting his first major assertion of presidential leadership since he took office on. July 1, 2005, Jenkins made a remarkable choice. In opening a University-wide discussion on the complex relationship between Catholic identity and academic freedom, the new president made known his intent to seek input from the Notre Dame com­munity before making decisions of this scale ­ostensibly because he truly cares what faculty, 
Jenkins' busy schedule also does not justify the absence of such forums. He said he chose to examine the issue of academic freedom and Catholic character out of a sense of duty to the University. Now it's his duty to listen thoroughly, not by cleaning out his inbox but by holding open forums where opinions can be voiced. Private meetings with select groups of students and fac­ulty are another step Jenkins should consider. Students victim­ized by sexual violence who credit "The Vagina Monologues" with their recovery deserve to witness their president's reaction as they tell him their painful stories. Gay and lesbian students who assume the University is ashamed of them when Jenkins insists on changing the title of the Queer Film Festival deserve to explain to him the snub's significance. And students who have no connection to either "The Vagina Monologues" or the former

soften a blow to either Catholicism or academia as a result of a decision that has been long-settled in his mind-Jenkins deserves credit for his bravery in asserting himself so boldly, so alone. 
Facing skeptiCal and even hostile faculty and student audi­ences, Notre Dame's 17th president proved he is capable of and confident when commanding attention and establishing authori­ty. If there had been any remaining doubt he'd emerged from predecessor Father Edward "Monk" Malloy's 6-foot-4 shadow, Jenkins erased it by his address' third paragraph. Now-with his authority cemented and his request for feedback widely praised-Jenkins must erase all hints he has prematurely made up his mind. 
What Notre Dame deserves from Jenkins 
One way for him to do so is to supplement his pledge to read all correspondence he receives with another, more interactive mode of receiving feedback-since a legitimate, productive exchange of views doesn't just move in one direction. 
The empty phrase "I appreciate your comment" left the presi­dent's lips far too often during the faculty question-and-answer session Monday. Tuesday's more meaningful interaction with stu­dents-"I like the give and take," Jenkins told The Observer afterward -was a vast improvement, but the session's truncated time allotment and pre-prescribed format still ensured it stopped well short of the debate's potential. Reading letters and e-mails is a good start-and is a decision paved with the right intentions ­but Jenkins also needs to talk face-to-face with people who feel passionately on both sides of the academic freedom issue to truly gauge the pulse of Notre Dame. 
What's needed, therefore, is a series of at least five open forums oflering sit-down meetings with the president and his administra­tive circle, in alternate small-and large-group settings ranging from dorms to the DeBartolo Center for the Performing Arts. The confident president speaking on stage Monday and Tuesday has no excuse to hide behind a computer screen. 
The Observer did not expect to be mentioned in University President Father John Jenkins' addresses on academic freedom and Catholic character this week. The Observer was pleased to hear Jenkins echo the words of his predecessors by saying, "In its coverage of the news, including issues involving [the] University administration, The Observer has had, and will continue to have, editorial freedom." 
However, The Observer wishes to clarifY the por­tion of Jenkins' address pertaining to The O Jhe 
userver

Observer's financial relationship with the 
Above all, before announcing a decision in favor 
of or against events he deems inconsistent with Catholic values, Jenkins should make time to actually attend them. Reading a play "a couple times" and disliking its content doesn't begin to compare with witnessing an emotion-and hon­esty-infused performance. So go see "The Vagina Monologues," Father-surely organizers would reserve you a front-row seat in DeBartolo 101. 
Jenkins cannot claim to make an informed decision without seeing the "Monologues" and the film festival this February­and he cannot claim to initiate a University "conversation" about academic freedom and Catholic character without meaningfully participating in it. 
What Jenkins deserves from Notre Dame 
Students and faculty must also uphold their part of the bar­gain. Tuesday's student question-and-answer session was an excellent example of the student body's potential to be at once courteous and brave. 
This is not an occasion to be apathetic. Jenkins' eventual deci­sion represents much more than whether or not the girl down the hall will be selling tickets for her performance in "The Vagina Monologues," or whether a roommate will need to explain to his grandparents why the words "Queer" and "Festival" once appeared in the title of an academic event at Notre Dame. The outcome of the academic freedom and Catholic character debate could very well determine what-five, 10, 20, 50 years down the road -our Notre Dame diplomas will repre­sent. 
Everyone associated with the University has a stake in this decision. And since today's students and faculty are fortunate enough to be here for the conversation, it is their duty to fight for their vision of Notre Dame to be achieved. 
We are Notre Dame, and we must engage with Jenkins deeply, respectfully and fearlessly in the "conversation" about what Notre Dame will become.

Observer's account. Neither Notre Dame nor Saint Mary's enjoys any decision-making power over The Observer's budget and finances. 
Jenkins said, "The standards of editorial and journalistic prac­tice that we expect at The Observer are those recognized by the most respected newspapers in this country." Indeed, The Observer has implemented and upheld its own stringent editorial and journalistic standards since it was independ­ently founded nearly 40 years ago. The Observer strives for these standards in its service of the 

and "because student fees support the operation of The Observer, it has an obligation to serve the entire community in a manner consonant with the ideals of the University." 
Funding for The Observer comes from three sources: display, classified and online advertising; mail subscription fees collected by The Observer;· and student subscription fees collected each semester by Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. The University and the College collect these fees-which make up between 10 and 15 percent of The Observer's annual funding -from student sub­scribers as a matter of convenience, and deposit them into The subscription fees obligates The Observer to do so, 
but because the newspaper's goals are to report on the issues and events of both campuses independently, fairly and accurately and to provide forums for the community to express ideas via letters to the editor, columns and advertisements. 
In light of Jenkins' description of The Observer as "an important means for student involvement and expression on campus," this newspaper will devote its Viewpoint pages next week as com­pletely as feedback allows toward publishing letters to the editor dealing with the topic of academic freedom and Catholic charac­ter at Notre Dame.

while attempting to water ski, I have been constantly rnmindnd that winning is not nvnrything. While these words might be comforting in times of dnfnat, tlwy are enrtainly no substitutn for vic­tory. · 
As a result. I am pretty sure that the Notn1 llanw Men's Basketball team would gladly tradn all the talk about Uwir gnmt effort for a win tomorrow. As you know, the Irish have fallen on tough limns latnly. Still, the resilinncy · 
How you play the game 
displayed by the Irish in recent weeks should not go unnoticed. Time and again this season, thny have given their all only to come up painfully short at the end of games. 
It all started in December with a 2­point loss at home to Michigan and has bncn followed by a January littered with improbable losses. In roughly a three week span, the Irish have fallen to Pittsburgh in double-overtime, to DePaul and Syracuse in close games, and at Marquette on an improl]able last-second shot. However, it was Tuesday evening's excrueiating double­overtime loss to Georgetown that really made the close losses notieeable. Once again, the Irish overcame a large deficit and turned the game into a nail­biter, only to end up on the short end again. 
It is sometimes hard to believe that there are players on this team who helped Notre Dame reach the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA Tournament just three years ago. Nowadays, students and fans alike have resorted to taking solace in the fact that the Irish are the best team in the nation with a 1-5 con­ference record. Even so, our team should continue to hold its head high. They have put forth great effort and determination thus far, and they are 
bound to reap the benefits in the near 
future. 
Although the team would rather be graceful winners than losers, the man­ner in which they have handled their recent slide. has been admirable. Neither head coach Mike Brey nor any of the players have pointed fingers or lamented over the fact that they are just one star player away from getting over the hump. In addition, there has been no dissension or off-the-court incidents that have marred struggling teams at other schools in recent years. The never-give-up attitude of this team has been commendable, and we should all be proud of it. 
However, this is Big East basketball, not AYSO soccer. There are no orange slices at halftime, and every player docs not automatically get a trophy at the end of the season. Simply put. we should expect our team to win. To be sure, the Irish have set an excellent example by handling their tough breaks with dignity, and they deserve our support now more than ever. 
Unfortunately, basketball teams aren't awarded points just because they are a bunch of good guys. There is no reason why we should not demand page 13 
more of this team. Sixth-ranked Villanova visits the JACC tomorrow, and the game provides the Irish with 
the perfect opportunity to jump-start 
the season. In order to pull ofT the 
upset, they will not only have to display 
the same heart and detnrmination that 
has gotten them so dose to vietory over the past few weeks, but they will also need to tako care of the ball, play bet­ter defense and hit a few timely jumpers. In addition, thHy will need the home crowd to give them a lift and make things difficult for the visiting Wildcats. 
So come out tomorrow and help the team turn things around, because all this losing is getting old. Even if we fall short again, let's not forget the great effort that this team has put forth, and remember: Charlie has a groat recruit­ing class coming in, and the Blue Gold game is only throe months away. Go Irish!

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Interpreting 'academic freedom' 
Speech's title deliberately misleading 
Father Jenkins' speech on academic freedom on Jan. 23 is a terribly disappointing development in the ongoing war on intellectual development at the University of Notre Dame. For as long as I have been involved with the University, it has sup­pressed and criticized many manifestations of homosexuality, and has been at best uncomfort­able with frank discussions of sexuality and gen­d11r issues. 
The announcement..<; in regards to the the Vagina Monologues and the Queer Film Festival came as no surprise. 
What was disappointing, though, was not these substantive positions, but the thinly disguised propaganda being used as bait to have the University community swallow them. Jenkins' use of the topic of "academic freedom" is a blatantly obvious veil being used to cover up the real sub­stance of the announcement, which is that the Univnrsity is curtailing public discussion of issues that its leadership finds distasteful. 
Only in the most misunderstood sense could supprnssion of important discussions on homosex­uality and female gender issues be interpreted as a frank discussion of academic freedom. 
The title of the speech is a red herring and I, for one, am appalled that Jenkins thinks the University community is so naive as to swallow this cheap tactic. It is a tactic favored by politi­cians who wish to deceive a doe-eyed and docile public. 
However, members of the University community, I fervently hope, are far from doe-eyed and docile. We are intelligent. thoughtful, and capable of ana­lyzing and deciding important issues for ourselves. 
Jenkins should have been honest in his speech; he should have announced outright that the University's leadership determined the Vagina Monologues and the Queer Film Festival are inconsistent with the University's Catholic morali­ty. If Jenkins had left it at that, this announcement would have been nothing more than a predictable extension of the University's historical behavior. 
However, in its dishonesty and expectation of ignorance from the community, this speech repre­sents a new and devious transgression of Catholic doctrines of honesty and integrity.

Defending Jenkins' message 
Thank you Professor Glenn Hendler ("The speech that was­n't," Jan. 26) for that very inter­esting speech that he along with many others wished happened several days ago. It adds much to the ongoing dialogue that will continue throughout the semes­ter. Currently, it seems like it's Father Jenkins vs. the world. I wish it was not so. 
Jack Shephard in the show "Lost" states it best, "Everyone wants me to be a leader except when I make a decision they don't like." We all want Jenkins to be a great president. I don't know of anyone that doesn't want him to succeed as the President of Notre Dame. People like Jenkins and Jenkins likes people. 
However, whenever he makes an unpopular decision, people are willing to string him up in effigy and curse everything a simple priest stands for. 
As, first and foremost, a lloly Cross priest, Jenkins must stand for the beliefs and ideals of the Catholic Church. It would be a crime to make him deny his very faith in order to appease a crowd. lie is not banning any­thing, rather he is creating opportunities for discussion and opening himself to be criticized. Many leaders wouldn't do that. It takes serious bravery to do that. 
Remember that it was only a year ago when people were crit­icizing him for firing Coach Tyrone Willingham and hiring a man without any major head coaching experience. We all know how that turned out.

Range ofviews is solution, not problem 
Though I understand Father Jenkins' decision not to sponsor "The Vagina Monologues" or the Queer Film Festival on campus, I am truly disappointed. I am a 2004 graduate, attending Stanford Law School. During my time at Notre Dame, I never felt that my ideas (though they are markedly more liberal than those of the Catholic Church) could not bn part of a dialogue that was open to the entire University. Although I under­stand that hn is eoncernnd with spon­soring events that directly go against Catholic: teaching rather than censoring that material, I do not believe Father Jenkins would be serving the University community by limiting the ideas that can be presented formally on campus. Unlike racially inflammatory or anti­Snmitic ideas, ideas about sexual moral­ity differ widely, even among practicing Catholics. There is a great deal of value to exposing the University community to ideas that dift'er from Catholic teach­ings. 
I am reminded of a passage by Justice Oliver Wendell llolmes in Abrams v. United States in which he asserts, "lTihe ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas ... [T]he best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market ... [W)e should be eternally vigilant against attempts to check the expression of opinions that we loath and believe to be fraught with death." Rather than not sponsor these events, it would be advantageous of the University to sponsor events that discuss sexual mores from Catholic teachings, and dis­cuss issues that are challenging to those teachings (e.g. AIDS in Africa). 
A better way to address concerns about preserving the Catholic character of Notre Dame might be presenting 'The Vagina Monologues" or the Queer Film Festival as a part of a University sympo­sium on the theology of the body and anthropologieaVsociologieal ideas about sex. I truly believe that the remedy to bad speech is more speech, not less. If Notre Dame truly wants to cling to its Catholic character, it will do well to pro­vide a forum for views that differ from Catholic teachings.

"Prince ofPersia: The Sands ofTime," making his debut on video game consoles. Released by UBI Soft with revamped graphics, a three-dimensional landscape and a new acrobatic combat system, the Prince proves that the crown still fits. 


'PRINCE OF PERSIA' THROUGH THE AGES 
By TAE ANDREWS 
Scene Writer 

With the new release of the latest install­ment of the reincarnated "Prince of Persia" series, more than a few fans have waxed nostalgic about the countless hours they spent glued to their Apple II computer monitors while playing the original game. 
Like so many great video game origin stories, the creation narrative of "Prince of­Persia" begins with a rather nerdy young man with a lot of free time. Creator Jordan Mechner watched hours of film of his brother running and jumping in order to best encapsulate realistic human move­ment. 
Using a process known as rotoscoping, Mechner went frame-by-frame through the live-action footage of his brother moving around and traced his outline in order to capture human movement in a highly real­istic way (for the time). This same tech­nique was used to great effect in the cre­ation of the original Star Wars trilogy, where animators used rotoscoping to cre­ate the phosphorescent glow of the lightsaber blades. 
First released in 1989 by the software company Broderbund, "Prince of Persia" was a side-scrolling, two-dimensional game with eight-bit graphics played on now-fossilized Apple II personal comput­ers. Fans of the old-school version will fondly remember swinging swords at malevolent skeletons, dodging spike traps and drinking potion bottles filled with vari­ous elixirs. The old-school version of "Prince of Persia" required the player to rescue a beautiful princess from an evil vizier (sound familiar?). The catch was that the game was played in real time, so that after one hour elapsed, the game ended. 
"Prince of Persia" was released to a vari­ety of computer and video game platforms throughout the late '80s and early '90s, including DOS, Apple Computer, NES, Game Boy, Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis. However, after the uneventful release of the game for the unsuccessful Sega Dreamcast console, the franchise fell upon dark days. Diehard fans feared that the series was over, that their beloved Prince had swung his last sword and dodged his last spiketrap. · · 
Enter the dawn of the third millennium. In 2003, the videogame developer Ubisoft decided to pick up the flagging series and released a new installment-"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time." The company faced a decidedly difficult challenge: how to reinvent the game for a new crop of videogame buffs now expecting spectacu­lar three-dimensional graphics and fast­paced gameplay. Suffice it to say, UBI Soft more than answered the bell, putting out the 2003 release of "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time" for Xbox, PlayStation 2 and Nintendo Gamecube. 
Complete with 128 bits (for the math majors out there, that's a 16-fold increase) of pure three-dimensional glory, the new reincarnation of the game managed to keep the emphasis on puzzle-solving and sense of adventure inspired by the origi­nal, while adding a few new features of its own, such as the time-travel element and more complex environmental challenges. 
The improved technology is not the only revamped aspect of the game, as the plots of the newest installments have developed to match the series' visual brilliance. In "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," the Prince defeats the evil Vizier and rewinds time, restoring tranquil peace to his king­dom of Babylon. 
However, in the sequel "Prince of Persia: The Warrior Within," this changing of the timeline incurs the wrath of the dreaded Dahaka, a time-travelling monster resem­bling the Balrog from "Lord of the Rings." Having defeated the Dahaka and saved the beautiful Empress of Time, Kaileena, the Prince finds himself in one last battle to save his hometown of Babylon. 
By resurrecting this franchise, UBI Soft has managed to create a gaming experi­ence every bit as innovative and revolu­tionary as its predecessor, but for a whole new generation of 21st-century garners.

Freestyle skiing, snowboarding draw fans 
Associated Press 
Count on the high-flying Olympic fledglings of freestyle skiing and snowboarding to pro­duce a "Hurricane" that Americans actually are eager to see. 
It's among the latest innova­tions by a U.S. competitor ­this time aerial skier Jeret "Speedy" Peterson, who hopes that landing his quintuple-twist­ing triple back flip will also land him and aerials. But while the world is catching up in American­made sports such as basketball, the U.S. freestyle and snow­boarding teams sense an oppor­tunity to improve their already strong Olympic results from years past against an interna­tional field that held its own in the early editions of these events.

Meanwhile, American snow­boarders continue to lead the evolution of the halfpipe by exe­cuting moves with names like the "Kasserole Flip," the signa­ture move of 2002 silver medal­ist Danny Kass. Kass was part of the U.S. trio that swept the medals in men's halfpipe that year. He'll be back again, having perfected a "switch alley-oop backside rodeo," in which he glides up the wall of the half­pipe going backward and launches into a flip and back­ward spin. 
He'll be joined on the U.S. team by halfpipe prodigy Shaun White, called the "Flying Tomato" because his long, bright-red hair flows from the edges of his helmet. White, also a skateboarding star, comes to Turin on the heels of an unprecedented sweep of the five-event U.S. Grand Prix that was used to decide the American halfpipe snowboard­ing roster. 
U.S. snowboard coach Bud Keene says he's never seen any­thing like White, who impresses judges with a mix of soaring, cutting-edge tricks and graceful execution of more common moves that many competitors would consider passe in this still-evolving sport.

Klug fights for place on snowboarding team 
Associated Press 
DENVER-The fight is much different for Chris Klug this time around. 
Four years ago, it was life and death, an inspirational return from a liver transplant, followed by a trip to the Olympies, where he incredibly and improbably left with a bronze medal. 
This time, it's a much less dramatic, but still pressing, matter -the matter of' earning a trip baek to the Olympics that he feels he's bnen unfairly denied. 
Klug spent nearly ninn hours in a hearing with U.S. Olympic Committee arbitrators Thursday, stating his case that he belongs on the 16-member 
U.S. snowboarding team that will be in Turin next month. 
''I'm optimistic," Klug said as he awaited the start of the hearing. "I think they'll go by the criteria and things will work out fine." 
The meeting ended in the evening. Klug's agent, Peter Carlisle, didn't immediately return a message seeking com­ment. 
Precisely how the criteria is interpreted by the arbitrators will determine whether Klug goes or his spot is taken by Tyler Jewell, the man tabbed last Friday by the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Assoeiation to go as 
the country's lone male parallel 
giant slalom racer. 
A decision is nxpected Friday. The USOC must finalize its Olympic roster and turn it into the IOC no later than next Monday. 
The arbitrators havn an interesting task in front of them and thorn donsn't appear to bn a dear-cut answer. 
According to selection crite­ria spelled out on tlw USSA Web site, up to two parallnl giant slalom nu~ers per gnnder ean bn nominated to t.he tnam if they have a t.op-l'our finish in the previous Wm·ld Cup season. 
No Arnerieans fit that critn­ria, so thn nnxt step in thn procnss calls l'or onn athlete per gendnr to bn seleetHd using an averagn of their top two World Cup results l'rom the season. 
The question being dedded is exaetly what the word "result" mnans. 

Klug's top two finishes are ,. 15th and 16th, l'or an average o1'15.5. 
Jewell's top two linishes are 11inth and 24th for an average of 16.5. 
But in World Cup events, there is also a weighted points system. 
Klug's two finishes were worth 310 points, l'or an aver­age of 155.

NHL 


Lightning defeat visiting Devils 1-0 in overtime 
Sabres topple Maple Leafs, Senators shut out lowly Canadiens 
Associated Press TAMPA, Fla. -Tampa Bay's Ruslan Fedotenko flicked the puck and hoped for the best. ''I'll be honest, I just threw the puck on the net," the right wing said after his goal with 
2:38 left in overtime gave the Lightning a victory over New Jersey and spoiled another stel­lar performance by Devils goalie Martin Brodeur. 
Fedotenko took a pass from Nolan Pratt in the lower right circle and scored only after he was unable to feed Brad Richards in the high slot. 
The winner came less than 2 minutes after Brodeur stopped Vincent Lecavalier from point­blank range to keep the Devils in the game. 
"I tried to pass and they cov­ered everything, so I just threw the puck on the net," Fedotenko repeated. "I didn't even look where the goalie was." 
John Grahame made 20 saves for his third shutout in his last five starts. The Lightning are 4­0-1 during that stretch, and Grahame has allowed a total of one goal in the four victories." 
"You know in a game like this that one mistake could cost you. You don't want to have that mistake on your side," Grahame said. "That's what drives you. No mistakes that will cost you the game. Stay focused." 

Sabres 8, Maple Leafs 4 
Thomas Vanek scored twice and the Buffalo Sabres handed the Toronto Maple Leafs their seventh straight loss with a 8-4 victory on Thursday night. 
Alex Steen scored twice for the Maple Leafs -mired in their longest losing streak since dropping seven in a row in January 1997. 
Chris Drury, Johan Hecht, Derek Roy, Brian Campbell, 
Jason  Pominville  and  Jay  
McKee  also  scored for  the  
Sabres.  

Fans booed goalie Ed Belfour after Vanek scored Buffalo's fourth goal early in the second period. Coach Pat Quinn replaced Belfour with Mikael Tellqvist. 
Buffalo scored four straight goals to take a 4-1 lead, but Toronto cut it to 5-4 by the end of the second. 
But Drury's one-timer gave Buffalo an insurance goal at 
6:18 of the third, and Vanek made it 7-4 at 12:47. McKee added an empty-netter with 1 second left. 
Steen gave.Toronto a 1-0 lead on the power play at 4:08 of the first, but Hecht's centering pass went off the skate of Toronto's Jason Allison and past Belfour at 12:38 of the first. Hoy's float­ing w-rist shot beat Belfour on his blocker side with about two minutes left in the period to make it 2-1. 
Campbell scored on the power play with a slap shot about three minutes into the second and Toronto fans booed after Vanek scored an unassist­ed goal on Belfour about 10 seconds later. 
Steen scored on the power play and Alex Ponikarovsky made it 4-3 at 13:17 of the sec­ond with a goal after a scram­ble in front. 

Alexander Khavanov cut it to 5-4 with 3:40 left in the second with a shorthanded goal after redirecting Chad Kilger's cen­tering pass. It was the first shorthanded goal by a Toronto defenseman since Tomas Kaberle scored one Oct, 2002 versus Montreal. 

Senators 3, Canadians 0 
Daniel Alfredsson had two goals and an assist and Dominik Hasek recorded his fifth shutout, leading the Ottawa Senators to a 3-0 win over Montreal on Thursday night as the Canadiens tied a franchise record by being held to 12 shots. 
Zdeno Chara also scored for Northeast Division-leading Ottawa, which outshot Montreal 33-6 through the first two periods and 40-12 overall. The Senators went 2-for-6 on the power play through the first two periods while Montreal had only one opportunity with the man advantage over the same stretch. 
The Canadiens, who have lost 1 7 of 19 on the road, fell to 1-4 on a six-game road trip that ends Saturday in Toronto. 
Hasek made his eighth straight start and only needed to make 12 saves-including a 78-foot slap shot by Mark Streit with nine seconds left in the third -to claim his second shutout in three games. He moved past Roy Worters into 11th place on the all-time shutout list with 68 after sur­passing Patrick Roy on Saturday in a 7-0 win over Toronto. 
Alfredsson, who has scored five goals in his last three games, scored his 250th goal on a power play 2:21 into the second. He added his second of the game on a 5-on-3 at 6:16 to move ahead of linemate Dany Heatley for the team lead with 32 goals. 
Jason Spezza and Wade Redden each assisted on both of Alfredsson's goals. 
Chara opened the scoring with a fine individual effort for his ninth goal 12:36 in. The 6­foot-9 defenseman stepped around Montreal's Sheldon Souray before beating Cristobal Huet, who made his second straight start for the Canadiens. 
The Senators converted their first of five second-period power plays when Alfredsson scored his 31st of the season early in the period to make it 2­0. 
With Canadiens forward Jan Bulis already in the penalty box, Souray was sent off for holding at 5:48 and Alfredsson made Montreal pay moments later when he increased the lead to three with a slap shot from the point that got past I-Iuet. who was screened by Char a. 

Hurricanes 5, Thrashers 1 
Niclas Wallin scored on a deflection 16 seconds into the third period and the Carolina Hurricanes pulled away for a 5­1 victory over the slumping Atlanta Thrashers on Thursday night. 
The Hurricanes, who lead the NHL with 74 points, won for the 12th time in 13 games, including the last three in a row. They came into the night with an 18-point lead over Tampa Bay in the Southeast Division. 
Atlanta is fading a bit in the playoff race, losing its fourth straight game -one away from its worst skid of the sea­son. 
The Thrashers fell behind 2-0 in the second period, but began to turn things around after star Ilya Kovalchuk was struck by a stick and headed off the ice with blood streaming down his face. No penalty was called, and Kovalchuk slammed his helmet to the ice in disgust as he headed to the locker room for stitches. 
With 59 seconds left in the period, Patrik Stefan swatted in a rebound with one hand on the stick to halve the deficit. 
But whatever momentum the Thrashers took from Stefan's inspired play was quickly wiped out by Wallin's second goal of the season. With the teams skating 4-on-4, the defenseman slipped deep into the Atlanta 
zone  and  deflected  Bret  
Hedican 's  shot  past  Kari  
Lehtonen.  

Craig Adams scored with just under 9 minutes remaining after a tremendous individual effort by Erik Cole to get to the net. 
Ray Whitney tacked on a power-play goal with 19 sec­onds remaining. Atlanta was down a man after Marian Bossa's frustration boiled over, leading him to pick a fight with Carolina's Oleg Tverdovsky. 
Hedican and Matt Cullen scored the first two goals for the Hurricanes. 
Cam Ward made 30 saves, but he also benefited from Atlanta's errant shooting. The Thrashers missed the net at least a half-dozen times on good scoring chances. 
It was a tough day for Lehtonen. Before the game, he decided not to play for Finland in the Olympics because he's still recovering from a groin injury that kept him out most of the first three months of the season. 


Linesman Thor Nelson, center, is caught in the middle of a fight between the Atlanta Thrashers' Andy Sutton, left, Marian Hossa, of Slovakia, top center, and the Carolina Hurricanes' Oleg Tverdovsky.

Seniors see career finale in Shamrock Classic 
Tournament-style meet to feature top swimmers, events 
By JACK THORNTON Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men will simulataneously "go big" and "go home" to linish its regular season this weekend, as it hosts the first annual Shamrock Invitational, a tournament-style meet boasting an impressive field. 
The Irish traditionally end the season with a dual meet against a familiar foe such as Oakland (Mich.) or Cleveland State, but this season the pro­gram decided to shake things up a bit. 
"We had a Shamrock Classic meet once upon a time, but that had an entirely different focus," Irish coach Tim Welsh said. "This is the first time we've had a season-ending grand finale, and we're pretty excited [be]cause it's a great way to end the dual meet season." 
.. 
No. 21 Penn State, Missouri, 
Louisville and Oakland (Mich.) will compete with Notre Dame in the match. 
"It is a very, very good field," Welsh said. "Both Penn State and Missouri have been ranked in the top 25 at one point or another in the season ... Louisville is one of the most improved teams in the Big East, Oakland raced really well against us in our pool at the beginning of the season, and now they've got their ace sprinter back." (WHO) 
Unlike a regular dual meet, which has 11-13 events, the Shamrock Invitational will fea­ture 20 events to be raced in three sessions over two days. 
"There are three sessions to this meet and there are three days of the !Big Eastl champi­onship meet, so each one of these sessions is flike l a day at the championship," said Welsh, who will try to coach the Irish to their second consecutive conference title this Feb. 15-18 in Long Island, N.Y. 
or the 20 events, live will be relays, putting extra pressure on the team's sprinters. 
"Any time that we can race our relays can only be a posi­tive for us, because relays ­come Big East time -will be very crucial in order for us to win the Big East title," Irish swimmer Ted Brown said. "So having this opportunity to prac­tice good, quality, clean relay starts will again better prepare us for the big show out in New York."

Saint Mary's to host last-place Tri-State 
By JAY FITZPATRICK Sports Writer 
As they head in to Saturday's matchup with 2-17 Tri-State, the Belles appear to have turned the tide on their season. After losing three straight games to fall to 5-10, Saint Mary's has won three of their last four con­tests and crawled up the rank­ings to fourth place in the MIAA. 
According to coach Steve 

Bender,  one  reason  for  his  
team's  turn­ 
around  is  the  

"We need to prepare

leads and force opponents to make mistakes and take bad shots. Even during the Belles only loss in the past two weeks -a 53-52 setback at Adrian ­the Belles staged a second half comeback thanks to a stiff defense. 
Against Tri-State, the Belles' coach is concerned with guard­ing the perimeter. 
"One thing that we must do is defend the three, especially since they shot 30 last night," Bender said. "We also have to stay strong at the post. That is where the difference in the game will be."· 
To prepare the team for the Tri-State game, and games against Olivet and Calvin next week -the second and third teams in the MIAA -Coach Bender has had his team prac­tice 5 on 7 and 4 on 6 drills. 
"We need to prepare ourselves for the tough opponents we have in front of us and the way to do that is by making things tougher at practice," said Bender. 
The recent success of the Belles appears even more impressive considering that starting point guard Bridget Lipke has remained sidelined with a leg injury suffered against 
that Lipke has 

missed. She has not played one minute since her injury but she is listed as ques­tionable for Saturday's game. 
Bender attributed his teams' success in part to freshman Meghan Conaty, who came off the bench to play the point dur­ing Lipke's injury, allowing play­ers like Allison Kessler to return to their regular positions. Kessler ran the point after Lipke was hurt but was able to return to her shooting guard spot when Conaty stepped up. 
Bender hopes Lipke will be able to see some limited minutes against Tri-State.

Following the meet, the Irish will have two-and-a-half weeks to prepare for the Championships, and they may need half of it just for sleep. The squad trained every day for two weeks over Winter Break, and this will be their third consecutive weekend of multiple-day racing. 
"I think [fatigue! is always a factor, but I think at this point in our season we should be ready to race, so having a meet over the course of two days should be good for us," co-cap­tain Patrick Heffernan said. 
Welsh said the main thing he'll be looking for this week­end is improvement from his team. 
"In the best of all possible worlds, this will be the fastest meet of season -by a lot," Welsh said. 
In addition to being the last meet of the regular season, it is also the last home meet for the seniors at Rolfs Aquatic Center -ever. 
Heffernan is one of 10 seniors on the team who will be hon­ored in a presentation Saturday night at 5:15p.m.

Sports Writers 
Saint Mary's will face Calvin College and Albion College in dual meet compe­tition at Calvin Saturday in the Belles' final meet of the season. 
Saint Mary's is coming off a 143-59 loss to Kalamazoo Friday in an MIAA dual meet at the Notre Dame Rolf's Aquatic Center, the Belles' final home meet. 
Senior captain Kelly Nelis capped off a successful home swimming season, posting wins in both the 200-yard freestyle (2:02.95) and 500-yard freestyle (5:34.02). But Nelis cap­tured the only two events for the Belles of the 12­event meet. 
Regardless of past scores, the Belles view them as strides of preparation the MIAA Swimming and Diving Championships in Grand Hapids, Mich. from Feb. 9­12. 
Belles coach Lynn Kachmarik said with those championships as the team's season-ending goal, they have confidently begun their taper period of deereased training in which the team does less yardage and more fast swimming to get into peak race shape. The meet at Calvin Saturday will be a year for three graduating pre-race of sorts for that seniors -Stephanie Hile show, in which Kachmarik and captains Nelis and Katie hopes to see her swimmers Dingeman.

Irish travel to Ohio State 
Notre Dame seeks to avenge two home losses earlier this season 
By CHRIS KHOREY Sports Writer 
After splitting w1th the CCHA's second best team on the road last weekend, the Irish will be away from the Joyce Center tonight as they travel to Value City Arena in Columbus, Ohio to face the Ohio State Buckeyes. 
Since going 1-1 against Northern Michigan in Marquette, Mich. last Friday and Saturday, Notre Dame (8­13-3, 6-9-3 in the CCHA), cur­rently resides in 10th place in the league. But their 15 points put the Irish only three points behind the Buckeyes, making this weekend a crucial chance to move up in the standings. 
"The most important thing right now is to get points every weekend," Irish coach Jeff Jackson said. "Our main goal right now is to go into every game trying to steal a point or two, especially. with all these road games." 
Ohio State, which was picked to win the CCHA at the begin­ning of the season, is a disap­pointing 12-10-4, but Jackson said. the Buckeyes are still dan­gerous. 
"It's hard to say what's hap­pened this season for them," he said. "Different things hap­pen with different teams." 
The Buckeyes are led by sophomore forward Tom Fritche, who has 22 points on the season including eight goals. Senior Dave Caruso has been a stalwart in the net, starting 23 games and allow­ing just 1.71 goals per contest. 
Ohio State swept a weekend series in South Bend 4-1 and 5-2 the weekend of Nov. 25-26 in what Jackson called "our worst weekend of the season." 
The Irish come into the rematch with a mild goalie controversy. After starting every game since November, Dave Brown was pulled in the second period of Saturday's 4­3 win with the team trailing 3­
1. Jackson replaced the junior with freshman Jordan Pearce. Notre Dame erased the deficit as Pearce shut out the Wildcats for a period and a half. Freshman Erik Condra put the winning shot past Northern goalie Bill Zaniboni with 12:10 left in the game. 
"Jordan gave us a chance to

win the game Saturday," Jackson said. "If I've learned anything from that it's that he plays better when he doesn't know he's going to play in advance. He came in on just a moment's notiee and played great." 
Condra leads the Irish in scoring with 23 points this year. That number, which includes 19 assists, leads all CCHA rookies and places him No. 10 nationally among first­year players. 
"Erik's been more consistent than any forward all season long as far as every shift, every game," Jackson said. "He plays a very tenacious game, he takes advantage of his skills. I'm really impressed with his decision making with the puck." 
The come-from-behind win marked the first time the Irish have won this season after trailing at the end of the sec­ond period. Notre Dame is now 1-13-0 this year when trailing entering the third period. 
''I'd like to believe that we're learning to win close games," Jackson said. "We've taken some time to learn some les­sons, and I'm not sure we're going to learn all of our les­sons this year. If we're behind going into the third period, we need to have the motivation to come back and win those games." 
The Irish were not the only team traveling to northern lati­tudes last weekend as Ohio State was on the road at Alaska-Fairbanks. The Nanooks and Buckeyes split the series. 
Jackson said that, while the long trip will have taken its toll, he doesn't expect his team have any extra advantage this weekend. 
"You usually see some effects on a team that just went to Alaska, but we just had a nine hour bus trip ourselves," he said. "If we had played at home, it might have made a bigger impact." 
Ohio State has won the last six meetings with the Irish, including the two wins in South Bend earlier this season. The last Notre Dame win came in November of 2003. Overall, the Buckeyes lead the series 24-21-6.

Dame's mind right now is this week­end's meet against Oakland and fel­low Big East com­petitor Louisville. 
The Irish believe they have an excellent chance to extend their 
winning streak to seven consecu­tive meet<> when swimming begins today at 5 p.m. at the Rolfs Aquatic Center. Oakland lost its previous meet on Jan. 20, 147.5-97.5, to Michigan State -the same Spartans that Notre Dame defeat­ed one day later, 156-147.

as the teams competing are some of the top programs in the country. 
Squads Notre Dame will face include Northwestern, Cal State Fullerton, Duke and Wayne State. 
"[Taking into account] all three different weapons, Northwestern has one of the strongest women's teams," jun­ior epeeist and team captain Amy Orlando said. "There are also going to be a couple bouts against Wayne State and Northwestern in epee that are going to be tough." 
The freshman Montoya agreed. 
'Tm focusing on the fencers from Wayne State especially Anna Garina," Montoya said. "And Northwestern is also very experienced. But we are defi­nitely not going to be underes­timating any of the other teams." 
However, it will be Ohio State that the Irish expect will be their toughest competition. The Irish needed to overcome a 24­point deficit in last year's NCAA championships to win the team title over the Buckeyes 173­171. 
"They are all fighters and won't give up," Orlando said... "That is what makes Ohio State 
so good." But the Irish will not be an easy opponent to face. The 
women's program returns sabres Valerie Providenza and Marie! Zagunis. 
"They're near the best of their weapon and they have the experience from years on the strip," Orlando said. "So they have everything it takes to be the complete fencer." 
The Irish will also feature key foilist Melanie Bautista and epeeists Rebecca Chimahusky and Orlando. 
Although the women will be competing with the best fencers in the sport, the men's team is no pushover. 
The men's program will be showcasing an elite list of fencers including sophomore foilist Jakub Jedrkowiak, junior sabre Matt Stearns and junior epeeist Aaron Adjemian. 
In addition to the veterans in the men's program, the fresh­men are also proving them­selves to be a critical part to the team's overall success. Freshman foilist Mark Kubik is credited as a significant inspi­ration in last week's duals at NYU. 
"At NYU he told his team­mates that 'we just have to execute,' Montoya said. "He wants to do well and works hard to get other people moti­vated. Everyday he works hard in practice and it is going to pay off." 
The women's portion of the competition begins on Saturday at 8 a.m. at the Joyce Center Fieldhouse.

Stephen Bass holds the No. 8 spot, Sheeva Parbhu is No. 14 and Eric Langenkamp stands at No. 65, with the team holding a No. 26 overall ranking. Although the early-season rankings reflect more on fall play, it is a confi­dence boost going into a match against the top-rated Cavaliers. UVA's Treat Huey is No. 6, Somdev Devvarman is No. 10, Marko Miklo is No. 46 and Rylan Rizza is 54. Unranked Doug Stuart, who did not participate in many fall tournaments, holds 5 on the team. 
Bayliss said that the top four of the Cavaliers' lineup are "pretty much interchangeable." 
They rotate four players into the No. 5 and No. 6 spots in sin­gles as well. 
"They're all pretty good, we're competitive with those guys," Bayliss said. "We split those two matches last year 5 and 6 with them." 
The lineup is much like the Irish, who this year feature strength at the top of the lineup and depth in positions through­out. Although Barry King is unranked, he spent the fall semester at University College in Dublin and has insufficient data for rankings. 
After last year's record show­ing at the Country Club of Vir nia (CCV) in Richmond, there again, making the travel schedule difficult when Notre Dame faces William & Mary on Sunday at 10 a.m. 
For Bayliss, a Hichmond native, the match is a homecom­ing of sorts. 
"It's played at the club where, when I was in grad school, I was an assistant pro at that club," he said, adding that a number of people from the club and his high school class came out to support last season. "We proba­bly had 1/3 of the crowd rooting for us, and the Notre Dame Club of Richmond got involved." 
He said that the club is a good venue for hundreds of specta­tors. 
"The crowd there, it's enthusi­astic and vocal but not vindic­tive," Bayliss said. "It's not all college students, it's a little bit of a wine and cheese club." 
However, the only pressure the team feels is from the big match waiting for them today. Bayliss said the team is confi­dent. 
"''m sure they're focused," he said. "This team has been com­mitted from the start. A group of them got together and almost all the guys playing were here last summer." 
All of the players were active over the summer, playing in tournaments at home or on campus. 
"I think we came back this year with a sense of purpose and they have done an awful lot to make themselves as good as they can," Bayliss said. "They've done all the little things . . . One of our team mottos is take care of the little things and the big things will take care of them­selves ... Then the ones you can't anticipate don't over­whelm you." 
The Irish take the courts at 3 
p:m. today at the CCV and return home to take on William & Mary at 10 a.m. on Sunday.

Foundation nan1es Sullivan Conn. Player of the Year 
By MIKE GILLOON Sports Editor 
Notre Dame center John Sullivan will be the center of attention on Feb. 11, when the Walter Camp Football Foundation will honor him as 

its Connecticut Player of the Year. 
The foundation announced Thursday that the 6-foot-4, 298 pound junior would receive the award, given annually to the top college football player in America 'who is a resident of the state of Connecticut,' dur­
ing a dinner at the Yale University Commons in New Haven. 
Sullivan, a 2003 graduate of Greenwich High School, spear­headed a Notre Dame offense that averaged almost 37 points and 477 yards per game. 
He is the first Notre Dame player to receive the award. Past winners include former BYU quarterback and NFL Hall of Farner Steve Young -who also attended Greenwich -and former Boston College and NFL linebacker Bill Romanowski, from Vernon, Conn. 
Sullivan was a three-year

Clawing back against the 'Cats 
Irish try to end losing streak, earn second Big East win against No. 6 Villanova Saturday 
By PAT LEONARD Sports Writer 
Notre Dame is running out of potential turning points during a difficult 2005-06 season. But Saturday is one of them. 
The Irish (10-7, 1-5 Big East) are almost halfway through their conference schedule with just one win over Providence (9-8, 2-4) to show for it. And on Saturday, Notre Dame hosts No. 6 Villanova at 6 p.m. (ESPN2) in the Joyce Center with an opportunity to improve its record and its level of confidence. 
"Our guys know it would count probably more than one [win[ psychologically if we got it," Irish coach Mike Brey said before Thursday's practice. "It would count more than-one in a lot of ways right now, any of these in this [upcoming] stretch." 

At the most critical junc­ture of its Big East sched­ule, Notre Dame meets Villanova Saturday and then travels to No. 9/13 West Virginia and No. 22/23 Louisville for consecutive road games on Feb. 1 and Feb. 4, respectively. 
Villanova is talking NCAA tournament, while Brey referred to the Big Dance in March as "that other one" on Thursday, indicating his focus is on making the con­ference tournament at

By DAN TAPETILLO 
Sports Writer 
Since both the men's and women's program's finished 4­1 in last weekend's NYU Duals, the Irish have been looking for redemption. The nation's No. 1-ranked women's team and the No. 2-ranked men hope to avenge their losses by coming out on top during this week­end's Notre Dame Duals. 
"We have to prove to our­selves that we are competing at our best level," eppeist Kim Montoya said. 
But it won't be an easy feat

NO WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
Bulls pay visit to the JACC 
By ERIC RETTER Sports Writer 
It's no team's goal to get to the eighth conference game of the season trying to fight to stay alive and claw up from near the conference cellar, but that's the unenviable position the No. 21 Irish find them­selves in. 
On Saturday, Notre Dame (3­4 in the Big East and 12-6 overall) will take on South Florida, (3-4, 13-7 overall) in an important game that will begin breaking up the 6-way tie for the conference's No. 8 spot. 
"It's definitely very important to get back to .500," senior

ND heads to Virginia to face No. 1 Cavaliers 
Notre Dame defeated Northwestern 6-1 in its previous match 
By KATE GALES Sports Writer 
Take care of the little things, and the big things will take care of themselves. 
The Irish adopted this as their motto. In the second match of their season, today at 3 p.m. in Richmond, the Irish will see if their hard work can pay off against No. 1 Virginia. 
"We know Virginia is good," Notre Dame coach Bobby Bayliss said. "They're ranked No. 1 in the country ... they lost to [No. 9] Pepperdine out there." 
The Irish are coming off a decisive 6-1 victory over region­al rival Northwestern and a stel­lar fall season. 
Last year, they lost 4-3 to the Cavaliers. 
"The match was pretty com­petitive out there [last year]," Bayliss said. "It was 4-3, and we expect to play well and expect it to be a close match." 
The Irish have worked to improve their doubles play this week after struggling against the Wildcats. 
"We weren't satisfied with it against Northwestern,'' Bayliss said.
