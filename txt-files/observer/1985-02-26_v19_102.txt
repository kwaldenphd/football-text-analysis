Seat belt laws should become more common to save lives 
Recently New York state passed a law making it ille­gal for a person to ride in a moving automobile without having their seat belt fastened. Other states are moving in that direction. 
Although the government, especially the federal gov­ernment, should regulate people's lives as little as possi· ble, this is an area in which the federal government should not hesitate to step in. If all 50 states do not enact mandatory seat belt laws within the next few years the federal government should pass such a law. 

There is little doubt as to the fact that seat belts can save lives in the event ofa serious accident. The fact has been proven many times over. The reason is just simple physics. Modern cars have been designed to "crumple" upon impact to take'some of the force of the blow and prevent it from reaching the passenger compartment. However, this design feature does little good if the oc­cupants of the car do not remain in the car, or are violently thrown around the interior ofthe car.

dent. Thus, the less intelligent members of the species are killed off and the species' gene pool as a whole is improved. 
However the key issue in this debate is still individual rights. A person's right to not wear their seat belt ends just as soon as it infringes upon another individual's rights. The right to not wear a seat belt does not include the right to drive up another person's insurance costs. This can happen when a person not wearing a seat belt is injured in an accident, and the insurance company

not wearing a seat belt decelerates much more sud­denly, usually it happens almost instantaneously as their head hits the windshield or their chest is impaled upon the steering wheel. The amount of force the unbelted person is subjected to is much greater and is often upon a portion of the body that can be easily injured, such as 
the forehead or the chest. 
One argument against a mandatory seat belt law is that it infringes upon a person's rights to mandate wearing a seat belt while riding in their private car. Al­though this is a consideration, the key issue is whether one person's right to drive or ride in a car without a seat belt supersedes other people's rights. 
In fact, Charles Darwin would not agree with a man­datory seat belt law. The fact that some people choose not to wear seat belts validates his Theory ofEvolution. Those who are not intelligent enough to wear seat belts are often killed in the event of a serious automobile accident, while those who choose to wear seat belts have a much better chance of surviving a serious acci· up 

roads that are used by every· one merely because they wish to exercise their right to not wear their seat belt. 
Nor does anyone have any right to endanger the lives of others becawse they feel that it is infringing upon their individual rights to require them to wear a seat belt. Aperson who is thrown about the interior oftheir car and can't stay behind the wheel because they arc not wearing a seat belt cannot maintain control oftheir car and may end up hitting another car. By endangering someone's life that person is infringing upon another's rights. Anyone's right to not wear a seat belt is forfeited as soon as they inconvenience or endanger anyone else by their action.

The extension ofparietal hours at Saint Mary's "met with very little op­position" in the StudentAffairs Com­mittee, according to Julie Strazzabosco, vice-president for aca­demic affairs. 
Discussing the proceedings with the Board of Governance last night, Strazzabosco indicated that the prospective parietal changes passed the first of three tests successfully. "It's now on to the Student Affairs Council and then to Dr. Duggan for the final decision," she said.

Strazzabosco pointed out that there was some opposition to the early locking ofresidence hall doors following the implementation of such hours. The early hours pose an exiting problem to administration and faculty located in LeMans. 
Anne Marie Kollman, vice­president for student affairs, indi­cated that any opposition will not be overlooked. "We have to take into consideration how many people parietals effect positively and negatively; then we have to weigh the odds," said Kollman. 
"I feel positive about it, and I am sure the members ofthe council will 
have questions," said Strazzabosco, 
"but I feel sure we will have the 
answers." 
The board also discussed the pos­siblility of a "Meet the Commis­sioners" night so that interested candidates would be able to meet and speak with the present commis­sioners about their position. Anne Marie Kollman suggested a half hour, voluntary informational meeting that could be held in the residence halls. 
The meeting was closed with a reminder that applications for Board of Governance commissioners will be available beginning Thursday, Feb. 28. Senior Board application~ are available until March 1. Both can be picked up at the front desk ofthe Haggar College Center.

FAF deadline is approaching 
By KEVIN YOUNG 
News Staff 
Ifyou are one ofmore than halfof the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's stu· dents receiving financial aid, March 1 is an important day to remember. It is the day when both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's financial aid offices will begin to examine Financial Aid Forms and distribute financial aid. 
With 66 percent ofthe students at Notre Dame and 50 percent of the Saint Mary's students receiving fin· ancial aid, filing a FAF is important business. Since aid is distributed on a first come/first served basis, those who meet the March 1 deadline will better their chancesofobtainingaid. 
Project shows advantages of area 

"Alive with Pride, South Bend/Mishawaka!" is the name given by a group of local residents, not all natives, to a community proj· ect designed to increase awareness ofthe area's advantages. 
The idea began with a committee of seven, approximately 18 months ago, and has mushroomed "to hundreds of volunteers who are donating their time, supplies and equipment," said Dr. Harvey Wein· garten, a local dentist. 
The community has many advan· tages which the public seems to overlook, said Weingarten, and the campaign will arouse the awareness Notre Dame Director of Financial 
Aid, Joe Russo, said a few things 
should be kept in mind while filling 
out the FAF. Make sure both sides 
are completed, sign the form, and be 
as accurate as possible, he said. 
Even though a signed copy of last year's student and parent's income is necessary, don't wait for the tax return to be completed before hand­ing in the FAF  
·To become eligible for a gift, loan or a job at Saint Mary's or Notre Dame, a FAF must be filed. When a student fills out a FAF he/she "becomes considered for every­thing" said Judith Casey, director of financial aid at Saint Mary's. The FAF is the only form that must be submit-
of these advantages with television spots, messages on billboards, or­chestration at the Firefly Festival, and themes at the Carnival of the Arts, at the Sunburst Weekend, and at the Ethnic Festival's parade (all local festivals.) It will also be featured at next f.ill's Notre Dame/Army football game. 
"Other than these events, what happens to the campaign is up to the people ofthe community," Weingar­ten said, "Until summer, the cam­paign is purely for the people, and no financial enterprising is going to be incorporated in it." 
Created, thus far, are the theme song, two television spots, four radio spots, and four full-page ads. They all ted to become eligible for available scholarships or grants. 
With the help ofthis form, the fin­ancial aid offices at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's try to provide adequate assistance through any means possi­ble. Often this will result in two or more forms ofassistance "packaged" together. 
Russo said there is no income cut­off for receiving financial aid; anyone might be eligible. The finan­cial aid office decides who gets money based on need and worth. "A student with a family that earns 175,000 may need financial aid more than a student whose family earns S40,000," said Russo. 
have unique themes, such as dignity, compassion, and counge. 
One example of the spontaneous increase in participation involves George Fischoff, a successful com­poser in New York. He wrote the lyric theme song ofthe project. Only four days after being contacted, Fis­choff, a South Bend native, had the completed tape returned by mail. He sent no bill. To get the rock, country, soul, and middle-of-the· road versions, hundreds of people, such as musicians and audio en­gineers, donated their services to edit and to arrange the song. 
Anyone may become involved in the program. Those interested may write to Alive with Pride, South Bend/Mishawaka, P.O. Box 780, South Bend, In. 46624.

Law School creates jobs for summers 
By ED..EEN HOFFMAN 
News Staff 
Making money while working in a public interest law job is a a reality because of the Notre Dame Law School Sponsored Fellowship Pro· gram. 
This program is designed for stu· dents who want to offer their time and services to public interest jobs but require financial assistance in or­der to do so. These fellowships give each student a salary of S200 per week. 
Each fellowship awarded is for one year. The program here at Notre Dame, coordinated by Assistant Law Professor Theresa Godwin Phelps, is modeled after a similar fellowship program at Harvard University. Each fellowship is awarded for one year. 
Each year beginning in Novem­ber, the NDLSSF program organizes a fund-raising drive and asks mem­bers ofthe Notre Dame law commu­nity to donate 1 percent of their summer earnings to the fund. The number offellowships granted is di· rectly dependent upon the amount offunds collected. 
Anyone interested in helping the NDLSSF program may do so by pledging 1 percent of their summer salary to the fund. Applications for the fellowships are due April 1. All applicants must demonstrate serious interest in a career as a public service lawyer. All students are eligible to receive this fellow­ship. 
Last year 1 1 applications were received and two students were ex· cepted into the program. Approxi­mately S2,000 was raised. This year's goal is S4,000. 
The primary focus of this pro­gram, according to Phelps, is to pro­vide an opportunity to assist the underprivileged in our country.

Americans have always loved to celebrate anniversaries so it is not too surprising that a group ofmen gathered this past weekend on a lonely Pacific island 750 miles southeast of Tokyo to celebrate an event that took place 40 ~ears before. On Sept. 19, 1945 three divi-

outside, looking in 
sions of American marines invaded an other­wise worthless chunk of volcanic ash to clear it of22,000Japanese soldiers and prepare the way for an invasion ofthe Japanese mainland. 
The subsequent battle for IwoJima became the bloodiest engagement involving U.S. troops in World War II in terms ofthe ratio of casualties to combattants. Of the 75,000 marines who hit the beaches, 7,000 were killed and 18,000 were wounded. 20,000 of the 22,000 Japanese defending the island died. The battle of lwo Jima soon joined the Halls of Montezuma and the shores of Tripoli in the annals ofMarine Corps history with the help ofa stirring photograph taken by war cor­respondentJoe Rosenthal ofsix marines in the act ofplantingan American flag on the summit of Mt. Suribachi. The battle was further glorified in a popular film called "The Sands of IwoJima" starringJohn Wayne. 
And so, 40 years later survivors ofthe battle returned to the still worthless chunk of vol­canic ash to ... to what? To relive the horror? To honor their dead? Perhaps just to remem­ber? 
A much bigger ceremony took place this summer in France to celebrate the 40th an­niversary of the invasion of Normandy. Other ceremonies recalled the Battle of the Bulge and the Liberation of Paris. Future celebra­tions are in the works for V-E and and V-J days. In short, 1985 is the year to celebrate, or at least remember, the great battles of World War II. 
I certainly do not wish to seem disrespect­ful of those men who fought in World War II, or of any man who, in good conscience, has served his country in any war. I have never been asked to do so, thank God, and can only imagine the fear, suffering and the sacrifice endured by all who participate. Nevertheless, I find something vaguely disquieting in these celebrations. The speeches, the flags, the bands and the national anthems all combine to leave me feeling uneasy. 
Seeing or hearing one of these ceremonies always recalls a movie I saw several years ago. The movie, "The Americanization of Emily," starred Julie Andrews as driver in World War II London who Calis in love with an American naval officer Oames Garner). The film deals with Andrews' conversion from English pro­priety, honor and duty to Garner's ethic of avowed cowardice. Garner argues that honor­ing war heroes glamorizes and dignifies the thoroughly undignified and inhuman act of warfare. The existence of war heroes, he maintains, makes it easier for politicians to convince young men to go to war. What the world really needs, according to Garner, is more cowards, and he proposes himselfas the ideal role model. 
The movie's inversion of traditional values and unorthodox argument is at first comic and innocent, but the ultimate message is both serious and compelling -heroism propogates 
war. 
To those who have suffered and sacrificed, I give my sympathy and respect (my thanks) but never my admiration. As a society we owe a tremendous debt to our veterans, but we cannot afford to give them our adulation. 
Ifwe must ceremonialiZ'e our battles, let us remember the rows and rows ofcorpses that lined Mt. Suribachi, the maimed bodies and the ruined lives. It might have been better if Joe Rosenthal had never snapped that picture.

Glad of Pettifer's war 
on conventional views 
Dear Editor: 
Ann Pettifer's iconoclastic views bring a rare breath of fresh air to an otherwise pious and parochial campus climate. Although I do not always agree with Pettifer's premises, much less her conclusions, I am glad that she has declared war on the conventional wisdom and has prodded people into looking at old realities from fresh angles. You should urge her to write more often.

Low attendance is not a reason to cancel event 
Dear Editor: 
Being the naive, wholesome, yet over­zealous freshmen we are, the scheduled ap­pearance of Father Hesburgh last Monday night seemed like the ideal opportunity to see this semi-mythical man in action. 
Attending a presentation on "The Future of 
Notre Dame" seemed like the proper thing for 
us, being freshmen, to do. 
After trekking across campus to the library auditorium and subsequently falling several times on icy sidewalks, you can imagine our dismay and disappointment when we learned from a note tacked to the door that Father Ted had cancelled due to "unavoidable circum­stances." 
Thinking perhaps Hesburgh had been called away justifiably by wealthy, donating alumni, you can imagine our shock when we read in The Observer the folJowing day that our leader had cancelled due to a lack of publicity and subsequent low attendance. 
We can only hope_that when such future 
events are scheduled that guest speakers will 
have the courtesy and consideration to fulfill 
their committments or at least give advanced 
warning of cancellation for a somewhat 
plausible reason instead of tacking a note on 
the door to avoid possible embarrassment due 
to poor attendance. 
And how does low attendance justify his 
cancellation anyway? Doesn't Notre Dame 
claim a real one-to-one relationship with fac­
ulty and administration as one of its greater 
advantages -or have we gotten this all wrong?

Recall election will not strengthen government 
Dear Editor: 
This is a response to the letter by Edmund Funai on Feb. 18 and his comments regarding the recall of the student government elec­tions. Through his zealous willingness to aid the student government in the restoration of some recently lost credibility, I believe Funai has overlooked two inevitabilities of a recall election. 
First of all, he believes Healy should ''legitimize his election" by welcoming a recall due to the fact that he was elected by a mere 24.3 percent of the student body. I fully understand that this is a disgraceful percentage, but I believe Funai ignores the distinct probability that a recall election would attract an even smaller percentage of voters. In this way, nothing is legitimized, and the student government will only absorb an­other shot to its credibility. 
Second, the newly-elected officials have a task ahead which includes the reinstitution of integrity to the student government. This will be a difficult enough endeavor without having to worry about a recall election. The recall can only hinder any progress the new govem­mentmakes. 
I fully respect the fact that Funai is "tired of listening to people complainingabout student government," but I believe that a recall elec­tion will only drag the recent controversy fur­ther into the depths ofdisgrace. It is now time for student government, as well as for the stu­dent body, to take positive steps toward the construction of a successful and respectable gove&:nment.

Appreciates kindness 

of the football team 
Dear Editor: 

Now that the football season has ended, Aaron Stevens and his dad, Greg, want to thank all the members ofthe football team, the coaches and others who assist the team for beingso kind to us and for allowing us to share a pact of their world -their joys and disap­pointments. Aaron had a lot offun and is crazy about them. He wants all of these people to know that he is their number one fan. 
Also, thanks to all the students around campus who take time to talk with us when we take our walks. They really make our day.

Pope John Paul II is a worthy vicar of Christ 
Dear Editor: 

In reply to Ann Pettifer's recent guest column in The Observer, I think that no better choice could be made than Pope John Paul II as the 1987 commencement speaker. Notre Dame is a Catholic university, one of the best in the world. As Catholics, the pope is our spir­itual leader. Simply by virtue of this fact, he should be asked to speak at commencement. However, this pope has even more to offer us. He is a good, just man. He is also "charismatic" -not like a Hitler or a Lenin but like a Christ. 
Growing up, he experienced many hardships. By the age of 20, most of his loved ones had died. He saw his world tom apart by decides to criticize the pope, he or she should war, yet he kept his faith.

'Witness:' Harrison Ford meets the Amish 

l  
Bob Phillips  ~  
Movie review  
I  

/fi//11/!Jh 
~ 

~w~
~ I 
Samuel Lapp, a wide-eyed ten year old Amish boy, was with his mother in a Philadelphia train sta­tion waiting for a train to Baltimore. He had never been to a big city before, and he regarded all around him with fascination. 
Not able to resist exploring this new environment, he began to wander the station, watching the people go about their daily lives all seemingly protected by an angelic statue that loomed above them. 
But the statue was not adequate protection; visiting a Philly restroom for the first time, Samuel saw two well-dressed, dignified­looking men slit a man's throat. Samuel escaped the notice ofthe murderers, but he must then act as the witness to the murder ofa police officer. 
Thus begins Peter Weir's latest film, "Witness." In it, he studies the Amish culture found principally in rural Pennsylvania. It is a culture completely unlike our own and it seems to us a hundred years out of date. Finding the murders too pow­erful to stop, detectiveJohn Book returns the Lapp family to their Amish farm and there (much like Samuel earlier) he views a different world. 
It is a world without cars or telephones, one in which all in­habitants are friends and they pitch in when help is needed. Most im­portantly, Book sees a \YOrld that doesn't understand the widespread vice and rampant violence in our world. 
Much to his credit, Weir doesn't attack city life. Despite all the anger and violence to be found in the city, good people can also be found living and working there. But Weir's interest is in the Amish, and not with the city. 
He shares the Amish distaste for 
bloodshed and focuses on it, 
making the death ofany character 
no matter who it is, a sad event, 
with almost all victims struggling 
desperately for life. There are no 
deaths to be cheered in this film, as one might cheer a death in a "Dirty Harry film." Every life is respected which is an interesting attitude for the director ofa suspense thriller to take. 
The film is not only a suspense thriller; it is also sociological study and a romance betweenJohn Book and the mother ofSamuel. It works well on all three levels. 
The romance is effective in that 
it's understated, with no recourse 
to sex scenes, which would destroy 
completely the Amish atmosphere 
'' The film is not only a suspense thriller, it is also a sociological study and a romance ... '' 
that Weir painstakingly tries to create. The romance is confusing though. Ms. Lapp may be grateful for the protection Book offers in the 
-city but she has no real love for his way oflife, nor he for her's. All they really have to offer each other is mutual good looks. Still, Weir treats their relationship with respect and taste. 
Harrison Ford is suprisingly good asJohn Book. Usually a wooden

Snowplows are curious creatures. 
They can work and work and work

 claims to be immune to I.R.S., but I.RS. still strikes fear into the hearts ofthat university's off-campus stu­dents and faculty. They know the idea ofimmunity to be a fallacious one, indeed. 
How then, you ask, can we fight this nasty, naughty I.R.S.? Quite frankly, the Syndrome has no real cure, and only one natural predator to control it -none other than the rarest ofrare, the endangered Snowplow. 
C.A.RS. wants to reintroduce, or maybe just introduce, the Snowplow to Indiana. By bringing the Snowplow to the Hoosier state, C.A.RS. members hope to lessen the effects ofthe treacherous I.RS. and to improve the general health and well-being ofthe community. 
But C.A.RS. needs your help. It is establishing the "No More Slush" Fund to finance the purchase ofa domesticated Snowplow and its transportation to South Bend. Ifthe fund is large enough, C.A.RS. mem­bers will also purchase a manual called "The Proper Care, Exercise and Grooming ofYour Domest­icated Snowplow." C.A.RS. mem­bers say that this manual is especially helpful for those, like the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's commu­nity, with little or no experience in the handling ofSnowplows. 
Should the "No More Slush" Fund campaign be successful, C.A.RS. will proceed with plans for its next superproject. University specialists are already hard at work in Galvin and Fitzpatrick Halls, designing and developing new breeds of Snowplows. Officials say that these Snowplows will be specially suited to clear campus thoroughfares without posing serious health hazards to pedestrians. Testing of the new breed may begin as soon as April in New Antarctica (known previously as the South Stadium Student Parking Lot). 
In the meantime, join the fight to save the endangered Snowplow and help to wipe out I.R.S. in our lifetime. Send your contributions to "C.A.R.S.," care ofThe Observer. 
Happy trails, you snowbound domers. And try to spend your spring break in a land where precipitation doesn't take up per­manent residency. 
actor overwhelmed by flashy spe­cial effects, he is given a chance to prove that he can show emotion in this relatively quiet film, and he does it well. This is the first time I've seen him given a chance to act seriously, and I was pleasantly suprised. Kelly McGillis is also good 
as Samuel's mother, playing the role with the restraint necessary to 
capture her character's upbringing. 
The real suprise of the film was the performance by Lukas Haas, as Samuel. The boy was perfect in the 'opening ofthe film as a walking camera, betraying little emotion as he observes the city which seems ready to overwhelm him. His stare catches everything. 
When emotion is called for, he's ready, watching the murder with a terrific mix offear and confusion as he tries to understand a scene he's never imagined before. Even in his own world, his curious stare per­sists as he studies Book's and the detectives' attempt to understand the new world that surrounds them. 
Herein lies the major flaw ofthe 
film, making a potentially excellent 
piece ofwork into merely a good 
film. The beginning ofthe film has a 
clear-cut center, the boy. We see 
what he sees, and although we've 
seen it all before, his fascination 
makes us equally fascinated. 
The boy immediately establishes himselfas the most interesting character in the film, aridJt~hn Book, as his name implies,1s a sort ofteacher, exposing the boy to the new world of Philadelphia. 
Then we move to Lancaster Pa., the home ofthe Amish. The boy's role as camera is finished. He vir­tually disappears, and his presence is missed. Ford is given the oppur­tunity to replace him as fascinated observer, but Weir never makes the connection, making the character ofJohn Book into a detached and somewhat amused watcher. 
Book sees the world ofthe Amish as an interesting sidestep in his life, but no more. Weir may love the Amish, but Book doesn't, and the film loses out as a result. 
Despite these losses, the film is worth seeing. Weir's direction is both sensitive and captivating, often gripping us with suspense or lulling us with beauty. And the beauty of rural Pennsylvania plays an impor­tant part in the film, a great contrast to a Philly restroom. 
lbe plotis thrilling and the 
romance fresh and touching. Amish 
leaders have complained that the 
film doesn't present their culture 
accurately, but whether it does or 
not, the culture that is revealed is 
absorbing. 



Vic Sciulli 
Record review 
Provocative, moody, jazzy and bluesy, Diamond life, the debut album from Sade, is the best album by a female vocalist since Rickie Lee Jones' Pirates and one ofthe best by a female vocalist in years. 
Sade (pronounced Shar-D A Y), already a toast ofthe British scene, stands out in a multi-faceted work which merges the classic sounds of jazz and blues with African rhythms and harmonies. To the sensuous clip ofa samba or a pounding Motown pulse, her close col­laborator Stuart Matthewman pro­vides atmospheric guitar accompaniment and smooth sax fills. The two are joined by the seamless rhythm section of Paul Denman (bass) and Paul Cooke (drums). 
It is Sade, however, who is the spotlight. Her power lies in her ability to fuse her silky smooth vocals with the band's rhythm and blues sound to create a graceful yet powerful musical synthesis. Hints of her enchantment withthe sophisti: cated soul-sounds ofearly Motown singers abound. In "Your Love is ­King," Sade's jazzy phrasing evokes memories ofthe late Bille Holiday's classic vocal sound, while "Hang on To Your Love" and "Cherry Pie" are flavored by a smoky nightclub blues sound. 
The Rickie Lee Jones-ish "Sally" is a slower, more intense track. Here Sade's vocals fall to a more desper­ate, pleading sound, meshed per­fectly with Matthewman's gorgeous sax. 
Sade co-wrote all but one ofthe albums nine tracks, the exception being a stunning remake ofthe 1972 Timmy Thomas hit "Why Can't We live Together." The song commences with a tribal drum opening with the other instruments working in one by one until Sade's vocals spill over the instruments. Sad and mesmerizing, it is one of the best tracks on a gem ofanal­bum.

While the results proved rather grim, they did nevertheless prove that the Irish are able to compete with the best. The 5-11 loss to the Tartans, was, in the end, an improve­ment over an early 13-3 loss in which freshman Molly Sullivan ac­counted for all three Irish wins. 
"The three teams that are going to make it to the NCAAs from the Mid­west will come from a group includ­ing Ohio State, Wayne State, Wisconsin, Northwestern, and Notre Dame," said DeCicco. "I'd like to think that we'll be fencing in the ACC on March 18.".

ND women's basketball team faces critical rematch against Ramblers 
By LARRY BURKE 
Sports Writer 
The stretch run for the North Star Conference championship begins tonight in Chicago as the Notre Dame women's basketball team takes on the Ramblers of Loyola Uni­versity in Alumni Gym at 7:30 CST. 
The two teams met just six days ago in the ACC, when the Irish came out on top, 84-59. Tonight's contest was originally slated for jan. 25, but poor weather conditions prevented Mary DiStanislao's squad from making the trip that afternoon. The resheduling ofthe Loyola contest for tonight puts the Irish in the un­enviable position of having to play three games in a five-day span. 
"Obviously I would have preferred to play this game back on january 25," notes DiStanislao, whose squad stands at I 5-8 this season, "but this was the only altern­ative that we had in the situation. It'll be a grueling week for us, but ifcan pull out this string of games, then we'll be doing pretty well." 
After struggling for most of the first half in the last Loyola game, the Irish eventually made short work of the Ramblers, setting a new team record with 57 points in the second

The men's 'A'Ieague interhall bas­ketball playoffs arc really beginning to heat up. The first two rounds have been played and the loser's bracket has been established. 
In the first round, Grace defeated Aanner while Dillon fell at the hands of St. Ed's. The top two seeds of the tournament, Sorln and Morrissey, one and two respectively, received byes in this round and automatically advan<:ed to the next round ofcom­petition. 
Flanner and Dillon met in th~ first half. Trena Keys led the way for Notre Dame in that contest, scoring 28 points, 23 ofthose in the second half. Mary Beth Schueth added I 7 points and I 5 rebounds, while Sandy Botham contributed I 7 points and I 0 rebounds and Laura Dougherty came of the bench to score I I points. 
Some hot outside shooting by point guard Faith Mimnaugh kept the Ramblers in the game for a while, but Notre Dame ultimately proved too strong inside. Mimnaugh finished with 14 points for Loyola, but the 5-2 senior ended up with just five assists, well short of her nation­leading average of I 1.6 per game. Mimnaugh's backcourt mate, 5-8 junior Kathy Leyden, chipped in with 13 points and five rebounds. 
The Ramblers' centers had q~ar­ginal success against the Irish, as 6-0 junior Sue Busic! netted 14 points and grabbed 13 rebounds and 6-0 junior Maureen McNerney added nine points, but forwards Kathy Meyers and jackie Huszti were in­visible for most of the evening. Meyers hit on just one of five field goal attempts and ended up with just two points in 30 minutes, while Huszti missed all five of her shots 
round of competition in the loser's bracket. Aanner emerged victorious by a score of 48-37. 
Second round action in the win­ner's bracket was highlighted by the top two seeds advancing with nar­row victories. Sorin got by St. Ed's for the second time this season, 44­42. 
"It was a typical Sorin-St. Ed's game -physical and intense," said Sorin captain Pat Collins. 
This was a hard-fought battle throughout. Sorin was down by five at the half, but it eventually pulled the game out by making key free

way through the second halfafter 16 
scoreless minutes. 

Tonight's task may not be as easy for Notre Dame, however, as the Irish will have to deal with the disad­vantage of playing in unfamiliar sur­roundings as well as the fatigue factor of having played DePaul just two days ago. 
"It's a tough week for us," says DiStanislao, "but everybody's really up for it -the players have a lot of · extraenergy. Still, the bench is going to be key for us, particularly against Loyola. We have the advantage in depth over Loyola, as far as experi­ence is concerned. Laura had a good game for us the last time we played them, and we also have experienced players in Ruth (Kaiser) and Denise (Basford). And with Kathy ( Brommeland) and Beth (Morrison), we've got added size coming offthe bench. 
"I expect more of an up-tempo game from them this time," says DiS­tanislao. "Loyola will be more com­fortable in its own gym, and we're expecting better execution from them. We have to play better defense, move better without the ball, and use screens more effec­tively in order to win."

"We put in a much smaller lineup consisting of four guards and a for­ward," said Collins. "-This forced St. Ed's into many turnovers which were eventually converted into bas­kets. This was the key to our com­eback victory." 
In the other second-round contest, Morrissey defeated Grace in another close game, also decided by two points, 47-45. 
"We were worried about this game." said Morrissey captain Steve Treacy, "because we had beaten Grace twice within two weeks. Both of those games were tight and we

The Saint Mary's basketball team 
made the 200-mile trek north to the 
University of Michigan-Dearborn 
Saturday to play its fifth game in 
seven days. The Belles were unable 
to come away victorious, though, 
dropping a 63-53 decision. 
The Belles season record falls to 
4-1 5 with one game remaining on 
their 1985 schedule. Michigan­
Dearborn improved its record to 12· 
8. 

"Michigan-Dearborn was a big team. I was pleased with the way we handled their size and battled it out," said Saint Mary's head coach Marvin Wood. "We' were down but not out. We were behind by I 5 points and could have quit. It's a credit to our players, especially with all the season's losses." 
With one Michigan-Dearborn player grabbing a game-high I 7 rebounds, superior size and rebounding were definitely the keys to the game as the host team raced to an early 9-4 lead. The Belles were unable to gain control in the first 20 minutes of play and found them­selves down by I 2, 38-26, at the half. 
In the second half of action, Saint Mary's never gave up, and eventually closed the gap to 61-53 with a min­ute left on the clock. But Saint Mary's was not getting the breaks Saturday, and the Belles were unable to score again. 
Overall, Saint Mary's hit only 26 percent from the field while con­necting on 13-of-21 attempts from the free throw line. 
Freshman standout Tammye Radke led the Belles with I 7 points, coupled with five assists. Junior cap­

The Notre Dame men's track team had fine individual perfor­mances Saturday at the Indiana TAC State Championships to help tune them up for the IC4A Championships next weekend. 
"This meet was good preparation for the IC4A's for those who qualified," said Irish coach joe Plane. Plane employed variety as he started some runners in events different from what they normally run. 
One ofthose runners wasjohn McNelis who took second place in the 1000-yard run with a time of 2: I I. 5.3. "He did very well in his

felt that it might be their turn to win a close one." 
Like Sorin, Morrissey was down by five at halftime. But by the end of the third quarter, it had a two-point advantage which was maintained for the remainder ofthe contest. 
"We are looking forward-to playing Sorin," said Treacy. "They are the number-one seed and will obviously be our biggest challenge ofthe year:I think we match up well and it should be a great game". 
These two teams will clash at 6 
p.m. on Thursday in Gym I. The win­ner will advance to the champion­ship while the loser will play in the finals of the loser's bracket.

The ~c:r/VIc Guarino 
junior Trena Keys will be looking for a repeat of last week's Im­pressive performance tonight as the Notre Dame women's basketball team travels to Chicago to take on the Loyola Ramblers. Last Wednesday Keys scored 23 ofher game-high 28 points in the second half to help the Irish pull away to an 84-59 win. Lany Burkepreviews the game at left. 
Second-round play in the loser's bracket continued last night when Grace defeated St. Ed's, 49-45. Grace meets Aanner Thursday night at 7 in Gym I .of the ACC. Meanwhile, St. Ed's will be forced to watch the remainder of the playoffs from the stands. 
Although many games have been played so far, there still is a great deal left to be decided before the cham­pionship is played on March 5. 
In 'B' League action la~t night. Stanford squeaked past Off-Campus 46-45. Stanford advances in the playoffs and its game against Dillon will be announced later this week. 
Wood also cited freshman for­ward Loretta Raycroft for her fine second halfof play. "Loretta came in and played well the last seven minutes ofthe game. She rebounded and played well offensively," he said. 
Last night the Belles had their . work cut out for them as they went for a season-ending victory. They travelled to Grand Rapids, Mich.. to take on Aquinas College, a team which has suffered only one loss this season and is currently ranked in the Top 20 in the country among NAIA schools.
