On the national level, Brinkman 
said that if Carter can be stopped. 
Udall has a good chance as the 
leading liberal. Since his strong 
showing in the New Hampshire 
primary there has been a renewed 
interest in the Udall campaign, 
noted Brinkman. and he expects 
that after the Massechusetts pri­
mary there will be even more 
interest in Udall. 
George Wallace 
When asked what George Wal­lace's chances were at the N.D. Mock Political Convention. Doug Kenyon. campaign manager for Walace stated: "We expect a fair amount of support on the first ballot. From there. it will depend on what Jackson docs." 
Coming from a politically-mind­ed family in Alabama. Wallace graduated from the University of Alabama in 1942 with a law degree. 
In 1946. after serving four years with the U.S. Air Corps, he became .at age 27. Assistant Attorney General of Alabama. From 1952­1953. Wallace served as the Circuit Judge of the Third Judicial Caircuit and in 1962 was elected Governor of Alabama. He has since held the office for three terms. 
He pursued presidential cam­paigns in 1968 and 1972 and has been involved in the allocation of funds for health. recreation and education. 
Nationallv. Kenvon stated Wal­lace's cha.nces are "not very good." Kenyon said that "the base support of the party is not there." 
When asked how Wallace's campaign is progressing on cam­pus. Kenyon noted: "people have been generally apathetic, including the delegates." 

Henry M. "Scoop" 
Jackson 

The success of Henry Jackson's campaign for the nomination at the Mock Democratic Convention "depends on what the students are looking for," according to his Notre Dame campaign manager Steve Reynolds. 
"Nationally, however, his chan­ces are a lot better," explained Reynolds. "He represents the flow of what people feel." 
Jackson, who at the age of only 26 was elected County Prosecutor of Snohomish County, Washington, has served in the House and Senate for 34 years. During his years in the House, Jackson was known for his strong pro-civil rights stance, and following his election to the Senate in 1952, Jackson established an outstanding leadership record on environmental issues. 
As chairman of the Senate inquiry into the Russian grain deals, Jackson has argued that there is a difference between a detente based on fundamental reciprocity and one which helps camouflage a series of unequal bargains, like the grain deal. 
"Jackson bears more looking into," commented Reynolds. "His programs dealing with busing, detente, energy and economics are probably the most workable pro­grams.'' 
Crosby S. Noyes, a syndicated columnist, has stated, "Jackson can demonstrate the charisma of competence. After 34 years in the House and Senate, he knows what he is talking about.'' 
Jimmy Carter 
Ascertaining Jimmy Carter's chances in the upcoming N.D. Mock Political Convention, Marita Spadola, Campaign manager for Carter, stated: "We think he has a really good chance to win, probably the best chance of any of the delegates." 
Carter. a native of Georgia. graduated in 1946 from the U.S. Naval Academy and did graduate work on the development of the world's first atomic submarines. He was elected to the Georgia Senate in 1962 and in 1970 was elected Governor. 
While Governor, he sponsored legislation to equalize education funds between .the rich and the poor, raise teachers' salaries, unify government agencies. His admini­stration bills, which were passed, included environmental protection laws and prison reform legislative packages. 
On the national scene, Spadola stated that "he is one of the prime contenders," but "right now it is hard to say". After the Mass. and· Florida primaries, "we'll be able to have a better idea," she noted. 
According to Spadola, Florida, particularly, will be an important state. If he can gain support in this traditionally pro-Wallace state, he will be that much more effective in the Democratic Convention this summer. 
Spadola stated that the Carter campaign on campus is "going real well." 
Milton Shepp 
Milton Shapp, governor of Penn­sylvania, has a ''big problem in name recognition'' and because of this is not taken seriously national­ly by many people, according to Shapp's Mock Convention Cam­paign Manager Harry Capadano. 
Shapp's campus campaign has been designed as a "favorite son" campaign while his major hope is "to be an influential candidate on the vice presidential nomination Saturday," Capadano said. 
A former advisor to the Peace Corps during the Kennedy Admin­istration, Shapp was elected gover­nor of Pennsylvania in 1970 and was re-elected in 1974. 
Capadano said that the candi­date's "economic policies are im­pressive." Shapp received much acclaim for his work with the Jerrold Electronic Company, which he founded and in which he encouraged the hiring of minori­ties. 
Shapp has run in gubernatorial races in Pennsylvania on his merits as a businessman capable of wiping out deficits in the state budget and received national attention several years ago when he met personally with truck drivers in an effort to end a nationwide Teamsters strike. 
"He's really not a big gung-ho guy," Capadano commented, but persons interested in Shapp on campus have found out what they wanted to know. Capadano added that he would like to see more 
interest though. 
Shapp plans to set up a commu­nication system "to let the people know at campaign headquarters what is going on on the floor," according to Capadano. Shapp is a 1933 graduate of Case Institute of Technology (now Case Western Reserve University) and served as a captain in the U.S. Army Signal Corps in North Africa, Italy and Austria. 

Edward Kennedy 

Although Senator Edward Ken­nedy of Massachusetts is not a declared candidate, a campaign to draft him at the Mock Convention has been organized. It is specula­ted that if no candidate emerges on the first ballot at the Democratic Convention this summer, a similar draft may occur. 
Hubert H. Humphrey 
Senator Humphrey of Minnesota is also not a declared candidate. Yet he has received the endorse­ment of the campus Black Caucus. 
Mark Frieden, press secretary for the Mock Convention, commen­ted on the possibility of a Kennedy or Humphrey draft. "There is an effort on camrus to try to draft either Ted Kennedy or Hubert Humphret and, as such, they are recognized as official groups at the Mock Politic~ I Convention,'' Frie­den said. "This is not to say they will be successful. They are recog­nized though." 
Robert Byrd 

The campaign of Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, Senate Majority Whip, is more intended to secure him the vice presidential nomination. Frieden said, "As I understand his campaign, he would be willing to accept a vice presiden­tial nomination." 
Sargent Shriver 

Shriver, who was the Vice-Presi­dential candidate on the unsucces­sful McGovern campaign in 1972 "is doing better on campus than he is nationally," according to his Notre Dame campaign manager Joe Anderson. 
Anderson credits Shriver's visit to campus several years ago as the main factor in his campus seccess, but cautions that "most people on campus have a wait-and-see atti­tude" towards the large field of candidates. 
Shriver, a native of Maryland, graduated from Yale Law School in 1941 after which he served in the Navy for 5 years during the Second World War. When he returned to civilian life in 1946, Shriver took a job as the manager of Joseph P. Kennedy's Chicago Merchancise Mart which he held unti11960 when he joined the Presidential camp­aign of his brother-in-law, John F. Kennedy. 
After Kennedy's election, the President-elect asked Shriver to organize the newly formed Peace Corp. Wtlile in the position as head of the Peace Corps Shriver visited more than SO countries in Africa , Latin America and Asia. Under President Johnson Shriver directed the Office of Economic Opportuni­ty, which was the first full scale effort to attack the problems of the nation's poor. 
From 1968 to 1970 Shriver served as ambassador to France, and since 1970 he has specialized in interna­tional law and foreign affairs. 
On the national acene, Anderson noted that if Shriver doesn't do well in Massachusetts" he will probably drop out or take a vice-ppresidenti­al bid.'' Shriver is presently short of money, Anderson noted, but he is still very serious about his campaign.

MOSCOW (AP) -Flushed by the victory of Soviet-backed forces in Angola, the Soviet Communist party congress gave unanimous praise Monday to leftist-revolu­tionaries abroad and vowed contin­ued support for their efforts. 
There was also an attempt to tone down the chief problem con­fronting the congress--ideological differences with Communist par­ties in the West. Party leader Leonid I. Brezhnev met with his outspoken Italian counterpart, En­rico Berlinguer, and they issued a communique affirming "respect 
for each other's independence."

DALLAS (AP) -The Dallas Times Herald said Monday it published a report on the spying activities of retired oil company engineer Nor­man John Rees despite a telephon· eel threat by Rees that he would commit suicide if the story were published and he were identified. 
Rees was found shot to death at his home in Southbury. Conn .. Sunday. hours after the newspaper reported his espionage activities. 
"In this instance, it was decided that the story could not be suppres­sed even in the face of Mr. Rees' threat." Ken Johnson, executive editor of the Times Herald, said in a statement Monday. 
The newspaper said in a copy­right story Sunday that Rees pas­sed pertroleum industry secrets to the Russians and became a double agent for the FBI in 1971 when federal agents told him they knew of his work for the Russians. 
The Times Herald statement Monday said its story about Rees' spying activities was developed from various sources over a period of some three months. 
"Once the basic information had 
been verified, Mr. Rees was con­
tacted and asked to comment. He 
acknowledged during the tele­
phone interview that he had been 
an agent for the Soviet govern­
ment," the newspaper said. 
The FBI, in a weekend state­ment, also verified that Rees had been a spy for the Soviets. 
The Times herald said Rees twice came to Dallas for interviews and voluntarily submitted to poly­graph lie detector tests. During these contacts. he asked the news­paper to withhold the story and refrain from identifying him.

Scotland Yard corruption tobe examined at hearings 
LONDON (AP) -Twelve retired or suspended British police detect­ives were ordered Monday to appear at hearings March 30 in what may be the biggest corruption scandal in the 147-year history of prestigious Scotland Yard. 
Two decorated ex-commanders are among the dozen men charged with conspiring to collect bribes and other considerations from por­nography merchants. Bail was set at $10.000 for each man. 
Official sources said it was the first time an officer of commander rank had been charged with corrup­tion, and the number arrested was reported to be the largest in any police scandal for at least two decades. 
Fabled in fiction and the theater, Scotland Yard has built up over the years of its existence an interna­tional reputation for integrity and incorruptibility. In recent years, however. general police criticism from left-wing and minority racial groups has included the Yard. 
After Monday's appearance in court, a lawyer and two of the accused compalined of the way the Saturday arrests were handled.

supporting so-called national liber­ation movements in Third World countries is not contrary to its policy of detente with the United States and other Western coun­tries. 
Speaker after speaker at the 25th congress has lavishly praised national liberation movements since Brezhnev set the line with a condemnation of "fascist-style programs" agains~ liberation fighters.

lution adopted Monday. It gave no specifics on what kind of help would be given. 
In great part, the resolution dealt with ''persecution and discrimina­tion against Communists" and expressed support in particular for jailed Chilean Communist leader Luis Corvalan and Communists in Uruguay, Paraguay, Guatemala, Brazil, Argentina and Haiti. 
Italian delegates interpreted the wording of the Brezhnev-Berlin­guer statement as a concession to the sovereignty of their party but would not go so far as to suggest that Brezhnev had backed down from his oft-repeated criticism of ideological revtsJOnism within Communist ranks. 
Other Western observers tended to regard the meeting and com­munique as not so much a Soviet concession as a peace gesture at a time when the congress is striking a theme of Communist cohesion. 
Berlinguer, in his speech to the congress last week, defended the right of the largest Communist party in the West to forge a path independent of Moscow and to cooperate with non-Communist I­talian parties. The Communists are the second most powerful party in Italy and have been gaining on the Christian Democrats.
