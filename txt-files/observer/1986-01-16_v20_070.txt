Deficit-reduction law triggers federal spending cutbacks 
heads to look for other ways to make the required reductions -including cutting down on travel expenses and not filling vacancies. 
"The administration's firm posi· tion is that we're goingto meet these challenges in a way that minimizes disruptions," Miller t:>ld a news con­ference. 
The cuts were set in motion by the issuance ofa joint report by Mil­ler's Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office projecting that the fis­cal I986 deficit would soar to S220.5 billion -S8.6 billion above last year's record flow offederal red ink. 
Miller said he doubted these cut­backs -amounting to 4.3 percent for domestic programs and 4.9 percent for the military on March I -would result in widespread disruptions or anything "like closing the Was­hington Monument or draining the Tidal Basin" here. 

But other administration officials said there would be "furloughs" at some agencies, that S<lme workers might be encouraged to take early retirements and that a plan was being studied for reduced hours In national parks. 
"1 think it's going to be weeks, if not months, before agencies Jmow for sure the ultimate effect on per­sonnel," said Constance Horner, director of the Office of Personnel Management. 
Shultz urges military retaliation 
WAStllNGTON The United States rlsk.'i having "a policy of paraJy:ois" ur les.' it is willing to take both open and covert military action against nations that support ter­rorism, Secretary of State George P. Shultz said yesterday. 
"We cannot let the ambiguities of the terrorist threat reduce us to total impotence," Shultz said in a speech 
dotted  with  references  to  Ubyan  
leader  Moammar  Khadafy.  The  
United  States  must  have  "the  

stomach," even when results are slow, to keep up the pressure against state-sponsored terrorism, he said. 
Otherwise:, "it would amount to an admis.o;ion that, with all our weaponry and power, we are help­lc:Sii to defend our citizens, our inter­ests, and our values; this I simply do not accept," he said. 
Shultz, one of the Reagan ad­ministration's strongest advocates of using military power against ter­rorism, made the remark.o; in a speech to the Pentagon-sponsored "Conference on l.ow·lntensity Warfare," at which Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger spoke Tuesday night. 
Weinberger has stressed the im­portance ofwaiting for an absolutely clear terrorist target and approach­ing military steps with caution · notably against well-armed nations like libya. 
But Shultz said, "It must be clearly and unequivocally the policy of the United States to light back." The United States should not always withhold such action until situations develop "with certainty and clarity," he said. 
Shultz's words were aimed not only at Ubya, but at Nicaragua, where rebels aided by the Reagan administration are trying to over­throw the Sandinista government. 
The administration is reportedly preparing to ask Congress for bet­ween S30 million and Sl 00 million in covert aid to the rebels, and Shultz said "covert action is not an end in itseU, but it should have a place in foreign policy." 
Early yesterday, the American aircraft carrier Saratoga moved into the Mediterranean Sea, joining the carrier Coral Sea In the region two days after libyan jets intercepted a Navy surveillance plane in interna­tional airspace and brietly shadowed it. 
Although the Libyan fighters -two Soviet-made MiG·25s -made no threatening moves toward the Navy plane, two U.S. f·A-I8 jet fighters were scrambled from the carrier Coral Sea to intercede if necessary. 
Shultz, in a satellite-hookup news conference with reporters in Europe, declined to discuss specific military moves, but said "as condi­tions become a little more tense we want to be sure we have adequate force on hand." 
Asked how joining the sanctions would affect Western Europe's need for Ubyan petroleum, Shultz said, "The world is awash in oil. You aren't dependent on Ubya for oil, you can get it in a lot ofplaces." 

Rockne Memorial 'legend' dies after 27 years of service 
By PATRICK CREADON 
StaffReporter 
Edward G. Kazmierczak, 54, 
died Dec. 3I in his home of 
natural causes. Edward, or "Big 
Ed" as students and friends called 
him, was the supervisor of the 
Rockne Memorial since 1958. 
"Ed was a legend in his own time," said Steven Cermak, an as­sistant to Kazmierczak. "For the past 27 years, every freshman had to go through Ed in order to earn their P.E. credits. He really loved the students." 
"Ed ran everything at the Rock," Cermak said. "I don't know how they are going to replace him. It will probably take several people to actually take over his job since he put so much ofhis own time into his work. He often put in 12 to I6 hours a day when actually he was only get­ting paid for 8 hours of work. He really loved his job." 
Cermak recalled an incident in which Roclme Memorial was · much more than just a work place for Kazmierczak. "In the winter of'77·'78, South Bc:nd was hit by a blizzard while classes were in session. Rather than shut­ting down the Rock, Ed actually lived in the Rock for almost the entire week. We brought him food from the South Dining Hall and he slept in the gymnastics room." 
Kazmierczak was born in South Bend in I93I and was a lifelong area resident. He at­tended Saint Joseph's High School. At the age of 27, he started working at Roclme Memorial. 
A Mass will be celebrated in his memory by Father Andre Leveille tomorrow at 5: I 5 p.m. in Sacred Heart Church.

A proposal to expandobligationsofindependent auditors, first unveiled by a senior partner of the Price Waterhouse account· ing firm during a Dec. 10 Notre Dame lecture, is receiving major attention from executives across the nation and has been described in their Bureau of National Affairs newsletter as the "Notre Dame proposal." Joseph Connor, senior partner in the New York office of the "Big Eight" accounting firm, formally unveiled his firm's proposal that "independent auditors would have to evaluate a client's financial condition as well as its financial position and would have to identify symptoms within a company's business environ­ment that would indicate a higher risk of management fra~d." ·The Observer

Lawful, not violent actions are the way to fight terrorists 
It's an ordinary, busy day, just like any other. People wait patiently in lines, parents trying to quiet their cranky children. Others hurry by, anxious to get quickly to wherever they are going. Families and friends greet each other or wave goodbye. 
Suddenly the busy peacefulness is shattered bya blast of machine gun fire. There is a confused scramble, and suddenly the hotel, or airport terminal, or shopping mall, has been transformed into a scene of bloody bodies lying in contorted postures, screams and cries coming from the injured, and faces white with shock and fear. 
As. horrific as this scenario is, it has become one so frequent it scarcely raises an eyebrow any longer. Ter­rorism is here, and it shows no signs of going away. In fact, its reality is more apparent than ever as 1985 was a record year for terrorist activity, with hundreds falling victim to the fanatics ofviolence. 
No person, no matter how helpless, seemed exempt, as the deaths of wheelchair-bound Leon Klinghoffer and It-year-old Natasha Simpson showed. No place, whether on land, in the air, or even on the high seas was off limits. The ugly spectre of terrorism is creeping closer than ever before, and it may be only a matter of time before New York and Chicago become just as likely terrorist targets as Rome, Vienna or Frankfurt. 
Even though terrorism has not yet really hit home for many Americans, it is beginning to arouse a deep-seated fear and a just-as­deep thirst for revenge in those who are most often its prime target. America is hardly ever as unified as it was in the burst of outrage when Klinghoffer was killed or when the hostages were taken in Iran. And few of Reagan's statements are as popular as "You can run but you can't hide." 
Terrorism strikes such a deep chordoffear because it is so unpredictable ·· you never have any idea when it is going to happen, or how, or to whom. You can never be exactly 100 percent sure that it will not strikeyou right where you are. Its perpetrators are just as unfat­homable, shadowy figures always hidden and usually a step away from those trying to catch them. 
But because of its growing boldness and increasing appeal as a convenient way to buy publicity, terrorism has become one ofthe most serious problems the world faces today. 
It has become impossible to ignore. And it seems just as impossible to escape. We can cancel our trips to Europe, we can avoid

flying, we can beefup security until traveling becomes a major hassle. We can eventually shut ourselves indoors and not risking going anywhere. But that won't solve the problem. 
Retaliation is no better a solution in the long run. Is­rael's stance, as expressed in the words of Prime Mini­sterShimon Peres, "Whoeverinjures us, we will injure," has gotten it nowhere except into an escalatingcycle of revenge ·· two eyes for an eye, 150 dead bodies for 100 dead bodies. 
What's left? Giving in to the demands ofthe cowards who kill innocent people?

Go ahead... That would be the ultimate defeat. It seems to be a problem without an answer. 
But there's one thing we cannot do. We cannot stoop to the level ofbarbarians and let our appetite for revenge go wild. However furious we might be at Syria for aiding terrorists, bombing some nebulous target would only fuel their hostility and give somebody an excuse for hijacking another plane. However nettling the taunts of Moammar Khadafy may be, taking military action 

against Libya would only kill more innocent people and contribute a little more to the breakdown of civiliza­tion. And lead to more terrorism. 
Such hatred and indiscriminate violence can only be countered with level-headed sanctions and fair, lawful punishment whenever possible. Nations need to cooperate much more closely in leveling economic sanctions against those countries that support ter­rorism. The media should be much more low-key in its coverage of publicity-hungry terrorists and their ac­tivities. And the United States should think seriously about its policy of uncritically supporting one Middle Eastern country at the expense of many others. 
Those who kill others and lose their own lives to bringattention to a cause have some serious grievances. And they are not going to stop because people are hit­ting them back. They are not going to stop until they get an unmistakable message that that's not the way you play the game.

NASA tightens shuttle timetable 
SPACE CENTER, Houston Columbia's hardluck astronauts, 25 days late getting up, one day early coming down, and unable to meet all their scientific goals, stowed equipment yesterday to prepare for the shuttle's first Florida landing in nearly a year. 
The Sl 'W million flight was set to end after four days in orbit with a landing at 8:28 this morning at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. 'lbe mission had been scheduled to last until tomorrow, but National Aeronautics and Space Administra­tion officials decided to end it early to avoid chancy weather tomorrow and on Saturday. 
With this morning's landing NASA will be able to keep to a tight schedule that calls for I 5 shuttle launches this year. That schedule al­ready has been affected by seven launch delays that kept Columbia on the ground 25 days past its original flight date of Dec. 18. 
The Kennedy landing is the first scheduled at the Florida space base since a landing there last Apri'I resulted In two blown tires and a damaged brake system. The problems resulted from the usc of differential braking to steer the shuttle on the concrete runway. 
Since then, a new nose wheel steering system has been installed and was tested in landings at Ed­wards Air force Base in California. 
One major experiment of the flight was planned for execution during the landing itself. An infrared camera mounted in the shuttle's tail was designed, to measure tem­peratures on top of Columbia while it burns through the atmosphere on its way back to Earth. 
Mission commander Robert Gib­son and his six crewmates spent most of yesterday packing equip­ment and turning off electronics to prepare for the landing. 
They talked briefly with Costa Rica president Luis Alberto Monge Alvarez. The call was In honor of astronaut franklin Chang-Diaz, a native of Costa Rica who Is the first Hispanic-America to tly In space.

Dorm thefts over holidays not excessive 
By MARK PANKOWSKI 
AssistantNBWS Editor 
Beded-up security at Notre Dame 
resulted in fewer reported thefts on 
campus during Christmas break., ac­
cording to Director of Security Rex 
Rak.ow. 
There was only one report oftheft 
occurlng during the holidays at 
Notre Dame, compared to ap· 
proximately six to eight during the 
same period last year, Rak.ow said. 
In order to bolster campus 
security, uniformed officers were 
used this year instead of people 
hired temporarily as hall monitors, 
Rak.ow said. 
"We think that really made the dif­
ference," he said. 
like Notre Dame, there was only one report of theft occuring during the holidays at Saint Mary's, said Ric­hard Chlebek, director ofSafety and Security at Saint Mary's. 
Unlike Notre Dame, however, 
security at Saint Mary's remained un­
changed from last year, according to 
Chlebek, who said he couldn't recall 
any reported thefts during the 
Christmas break. last year. 
Both security departments had of­
ficers patrolling dorms and the 
campus grounds during the 
holidays. 

Eight persons per shift patrolled dorms at Notre Dame, Rak.ow said, and extra officers were added to patrol the grounds. At Saint Mary's, security officers periodically went through each dorm, checking to mak.e sure doors were locked, Chlebek said. 
The two holiday thefts reported at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's were similar in that the perpetrator in both Instances did not gain entrance: by break.ing in. 
In the case at Notre Dame, in which a stereo of unspecified value was reported stolen from a fourth­floor room in Cavanaugh Hall, someone is believed to have used a key to enter, Rak.ow said. 
No one has been apprehended in the crime, though Security Is working on several leads In the case, he said. 
In the theft at Saint Mary's, in which a typewriter valued at S300 was reported stolen from a study carrel in McCandless Hall, someone is suspected of either using a pass key or entering through an unlocked door, Chlebek said. 
Because the fifth-floor study car· rei's door was reportedly found locked, there Is a possibility the woman reporting the typewriter stolen was mistak.en, he said. 
"She can't recall that It (the typtWriter) was actually in there," said Chlebek. 
There are no suspects In the case and the Investigation is pending fur­ther developments, he said.

Saint Mary's galleries set to exhibit contemporary artwork next week 
Special to the OIN!erftr 
Works of two contemporary ar­tists will be on display at Saint Mary's jan. 24 throught Feb. 21. Donald Furst's lithographs, intaglio prints, drawings and monotypes will be shown in Moreau Gallery; and Step­hen Lowery's constructions, pan­tings and drawings will be displayed in the little Theater Gallery. 
Furst's prints have been described as "serene, yet disquieting," and as having a "wispy, dream-like manner which goes beyond reality." His most recent works are a group of bedroom interiors created during a residency at the MacDowell Colony in New Hampshire. 
His work has been displayed in numerous one-man shows during the past few years, including at the College of William and Mary in Vir­ginia; State University of New York, Geneseo; Biola University, La Mirada, Ca.; and Fanny Garver Gallery, Madison, Wisconsin. 
Invitational exhibits have in­cluded the American Graphic Artists traveling exhibit in China; Architec· tural Images, World Print Council, San Francisco; and University ofDal­las Print Invitational, tour of Scot­land and England. 
Furst's prints have won over 30 awards in juried shows, including American Drawings III, a Smith­sonian traveling exhibit; Prints U.S.A, Pratt Graphics Center, New York; and the Print Club of Philadel­phia International Exhbition. 
Currently a member of the art department at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, Furst received his M.F.A. degree in printmaking with Mauricio Lasansky at the University of Iowa. 
Lowery's work portrays ~tc: urban landscape, primarily through the use of the images of faces and cars. Through his painted constructions, pencil or ink drawings or paintings, his figures interact with and against man-made environments. His silent screaming contortions elicit an amused yet uneasy response from the viewer. 
He has shown his work at Kankakee Community College; Prairie State College; The Beverly Art Center in Chicago; The Contem­porary Art Workshop; and The Hub­bard Gallery in Chicago. The

'Ibe Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. wa.."i honored on his '57th birthday Wednesday by schoolchildren and politicians, ministers and celebrities, who remembered the slain civil rights leader in ceremonies from his home state of Georgia to Hawaii. 
South African Bishop Desmond Tutu, who, like King, won a Nobel Peace Prize: for his efforts to end ra­cial Inequality, told about 1,500 people at a Phlladephia luncheon that "no one can ever be truly free unless all are free." 
"Thank God for Martin, thank God he was a giant among women and men, thank God for his vision, thank God for his moral and physical courage. He laid down his life for his friends," said Tutu, who Is fighting to end apartheid In South Africa. 
The: federal government has designated Jan. 20 as a national holiday to commemorate King, who wa.."i shot to death April 4, 1968, as he stood on the: balcony of a Memphis, Tenn., motel. 
"This Is the seventh year in Pen­nsylvania that we've: celebrated this holiday and every year It gets stronger," Lieutenant Governor Wil­liam Scranton told Tutu. "The dream of freedom can become reality, and it will come true for South Africa." 
In Atlanta, Coretta Scott King joined most ofGeorgia's top state of­ficials at the state Capitol to unveil a plaque commemorating the first King national holiday. The festivities began with the Morehouse College Glee Club singing "Happy Birthday Dr. King." 
Mrs. King called on residents of her late husband's home state to celebrate King's life: by honoring his dream of a "spirit of brotherhood and cooperation In the nation." 
AJso.Jn Atlanta, the Reverend Jesse Jackson accused Reagan of grabbing the spotlight on King's birthday and contributing to a distorted image of his legacy. 
Speaking from the pulpit of the Ebenezer Baptist Church, King's church, Jackson said Reagan was "the same man who didn't support the boycott in Montgomery -he was old enough. The same man who didn't support the sit-ins in Greensboro -he was old enough. The same man, he didn't support the freedom riders. The same man,

Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards told black leaders at a Capitol gathering that the holiday honoring King "is a time for every state In our great nation to renew Its commitment to achieve positive so­cial change through the use of non­violent means." 
Virginia state Senator Benjamin J. Lambert Ill said in a speech In Rich­mond that "King set an excellent ex­ample for this nation and this world." 
In Los Angeles, Helsman Trophy­winning ha!Jback Mike Garrett wept as he spoke at a breakfast, recalling how he met King at a University of Southern California rally in 1963 and was swept up Into the civil rights movement. 
ln Hawaii, there was a wreath­laying ceremony at National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific featuring a joint military service color guard, gospel singing, band music and speakers. King's writings were read during a ceremony In the Pearl Harbor Naval Station Chapel.

Dentists take measures to avoid AIDS virus 
made among civilian agencies, there 
won't be any in the military. That's because ofa presidential decision to shield them from the cutbacks entirely. 
Social Security payments also are exempted from the cutbacks, while Medicare and other health-care programs face reductions of only 1 percent. But few other federal programs were spared from the budget knife. 
Among the cuts outlined on yes­terday in the OMB-CBO report was a 5142.5 million reduction in revenue sharing funds for local governments. 
Mass transit systems around the country likely will see their federal subsidies reduced. The Urban Mass Transportation Administration's budget of H.7 billion will be cut by 
4.3 percent, officials said. 
Bonnie Whyte, the agency's spokeswoman, said it has yet to be determined how the cuts will be dis­tributed, but that most of the 5159 million reduction will mean cuts in money for transit operation or con­
struction.

Dentists also are being advised to sterilize more of their equipment, especially handpieces to drills and other devices. 
"At this point, dentistry has a brand new look," said Doctor Victor 
H. Mercer, director of the State Board of Health's Division of Dental Health. 
Dentists are being told they should wear gloves, masks, protective eyewear and protective gowns to keep them from coming into contact with blood seepage that often accompanies dental procedures. 
"If you're cutting a tooth for fil­lings, there's usually blood," said Mercer. "And any sort of cleaning procedures -scaling, polishing ­there's usually at least a little blood in the mouth. 
"So, if you have a person who has the AIDS virus in his bloodstream, you could have an exposure problem. And the saliva itself, it has been shown, can carry the virus, as well," added Mercer. 
Health experts have Said there ap­pears to be little risk to 'dentists -or other health-care workers -of developing acquired immune deficiency syndrome through their work. 
. But Doctor John A. Rahe, presi­dent of the Indiana Dental Associa­tion and a practicing dentist in Aurora, said the protective measures are a good idea because they're also effective for guarding against other infections -notably hepatitis B and herpes.

Ught said yesterday's incident ap­parently was touched off by the frustration of convicted armed rob­ber Namon Travis, 40, who failed to quash a transfer across state. to the State Prison ofSouthern Michigan at Jackson, where he had been incar­cerated once before. 
"He (Travis) claimed to have an enemy there and tried to talk his way out ofthe transfer. When he was un­successful, he went into the yard and

Despite possible disruptions, Treasury Secretary james A. Baker III said he felt the imposition of across-the-board reductions was fair and would accomplish cuts in some popular programs that Congress would never go along with ot­herwise. 
"I am saying we are going to get some cuts that we otherwise never would have gotten," Baker said in an interview with The Associated Press. 
Baker also discounted fears of some economists that wholesale spending reductions caused by the new budget-balancing law could damage the economy. "I don't think cutting spending ... is going to cause a recession," he said. 
Whatever personnel cuts are as well as security specialists will not be affected. 
Some 567.9 million will be trimmed from the n .4 billion federal student aid program, includ­ing $9.6 million from guaranteed student college loans and $55.7 mil­lion from other student aid programs, under the cutbacks. 
In addition, students applying for the loans will be charged a loan origination fee of 5.5 percent, up from the current 5 percent fee. Some 68,000 students will lose federal scholarships called Pell Grants next fall as the family income cutoffdrops by $1,000 to 524,000.

Choosing a long distance companyis a lotlikechoosing a roommate. 
Living together with someone for the first time can be an "educational" experience. 
And living with a long distance company isn't any different. Because some companies may not give you all the services you're used to getting from AT&T. 
For instance, with some companies you have to spend a certain amount before you qualify for their special volume discounts. With some others, voice quality may vary. 
But when you choose AT&T, there won't be any surprises when you move in. You'll get the 
same high-quality, trouble-free service you're used to. 
With calls that sound as close as next door. Guaranteed 60% and 40% discounts off our Day Rate-so you can talk during the times you can relax. Immediate credit for wrong numbers. Operator assistance and collect calling. 
So when you're asked to choose a long dis­tance company, choose AT&T. Because whether you're into Mozart or metal, quality is the one thing everyone can agree on. Reach out and touch someone~

One should be aware of the two sides of apartheid 
The blacks of South Africa have given everyone serious reservations about ending apartheid. The foremost reason is their own record offailures. 
Chris Edwards 
guest column 
Perhaps the best reason to deny them politi­cal power over all of South Africa is their demonstated inability to effectively run the individual homelands. The various tribes elect their own governments in these homelands and the Pretoria government gives them autonomy to run them. And, run them they do -right into the ground. 
There is no excuse for the failure of these homeland goverments to develop the vast mineral resources in the homelands (including one of the richest deposits of platonium in the world), nor is there any excuse for the lack of productive agriculture and farming in homelands that receive more than adequate rainbll. These opportunities are literally right under their noses, yet they fail to help themselves to them. 
We have also heard of the high infant mor­tality rates among the blacks. It is the respon­sibility of the homeland governments to provide adequate health programs for their respective tribes. It is the failure of the black governments to address these concerns and provide things like sanitation, sewerage and control of dysentery which compounds the problem. 
We have also been told of the inequality of job opportunities. Let us face it, preparation for such job opportunities starts with an education. Education starts in the homeland. The homeland governments fail to run even a moderately useful education system (much less one that will truly prepare their own people for economic advancement). The white government has given them all the latitude needed to run their own school sys-tern. The homeland governments just cannot do it. Ifmoney was the problem, they should have made use of the mineral resources and agricultural potential of their own territories. .God knows there is a great need for food in Africa and a vast market for minerals in developed nations. 
These problems are not exclusive to only one or two homelands. They persist in all of them. There is no excuse for all homeland governments being so inept or incapable of meeting these tasks. It is unrealistic to think the blacks could run the entire nation ofSouth Africa if they cannot even run their own little homeland. 
As for the controversy over carrying passes that tell their whole life story, the truth must come out. It can be hidden no longer. South Africa employs millions ofblackworkers from neighboring nations. To distinguish a legitimate black worker from an "illegal (black) alien" the pass must be carried. It is aimed at protecting the job market from il­legal aliens that would otherwise drive down the price of the black man's labor. Without such protection of the South African job market the native population would lose its rightful advantage to competing illegal aliens. Passes are not meant to suppress anyone ex­cept those that would take jobs from those who deserve them. As for all the information included in the passes, they must be detailed in order to be effective. In a realistiC sense, passes are only a very detailed version of American "green cards" carried by foreigners working in the United States. We should not be surprised by a government capable of fin­ding out so much about its people. Just con­sider how much information our own government can acquire just from our little nine-digit Social Security number. 
People who support the blacks in their drive to end apartheid have promised un­relented pressure. Pressure to bring about reform and pressure once reform is attained. Why? Ifyou get what you want, what purpose could it possibly serve to continue applying pressure? This hard-line stance makes no sense and is doomed to fail. Why should the government reform if it will not satisfy the protestors? Is not this the surest way to cause the government to resist any reform? 
The anti-apartheid people must open their minds to an understanding of the political reality involved. It is not as simple as they reduce it to. The controversy is not merely a black vs. white problem. There are instead two coalitions which include some seventeen interest groups. 
The "black" side is far from being homogeneous. It is comprised of some ten tribes ofblacks, and each one is very different from the next. Inter-tribal tension is con­siderable and is demonstrated in the practice of "neckery" (put one tire around a member of a different tribe, add a good dousing of gasoline and just a touch of fire for the "finishing" ingredient). The only real similarities between the various tribes are the color of their skin and their opposition to apartheid. 
The other coalition is dominated by the whites but also includes several other minority groups such as the Coloreds, Indians, Malayans, Pakastanies, Afrikaneer and even Jews. It is not so much a "white" side as it is a non-black coalition. 
With these considerations in mind, it is ob­vious that it will be no easy task to please even a majority of them (much less all of them.) Advancing reform will be a very delicate balancing act of give and take from each groups of both coalitions. Hard-line stances must fall away to practical negotiations in or­der to achieve a workable compromise. It will not be all give from one side and all take from the other. Those who declare "freedom now" and make ultimatums of immediate change are ignoring one very. important fact of life ­the South African Army. It is the best equipped and most professional fighting force on the continent south of the Sahara. It supports the government with unfailing loyalty, and rightly so. It will put a quick end to any attempt at immediate change{i.e. rebellion or violence). 
Another fact oflife, long ignored, is that the government ofSouth Africa is a democracy in its parliamentary form. Though it does not directly represent all parties in the country it is a democracy all the same. Two things emerge from this consideration. 
The first consideration is that as a democracy, it is by its very nature and design responsive to the needs ofits people, even the disenfranchised. It is a dynamic system of government that has the greatest capacity for reforming itself peacefully. Constant reform to meet the legitimate needs of society is its very purpose. 
The second consideration is that as a democracy, change will not be immediate. We need only look at our own government at any level (local, state or national) to realize this. But we also know that peaceful change is not only possible but an accomplished fact many times over. We also know that such changes and reforms are long lasting. 
Discussion ofapartheid must not be spoken of in favor of any side without including serious discussion ofboth sides and all parties comprising each side. There is more to this controversy than either the black population or the white government. There has been much said about the needs of the blacks and too little understanding of the government's position attempted. If we are to be aware of what is going on, then let us be aware of both sides. There have been various films and speakers on campus addressing the black con­cerns. What is also needed is an explanation of the government's position from a credible representative of that government. It is time to stop looking only one way and start seeing both the government's position as well as that of the blacks. I would therefore challenge those interested in making our campus so aware of the issue to start presenting us with both sides.

A changed grading system would be more accurate 
All high schools and universities use a grading scale involving flat-letter grades, yet many include other variables such as minuses and pluses to evaluate a student's work. At Notre Dame, however, the plus is nonexis­tent. Only minuses and flat-letter grades exist. Currently, for the letter grades A and 8, if a student deserves a minus, one-half point is deducted from the value of that flat-letter grade. I propose, for the letter grades A, 8, C and D, a scale which deducts a third ofa point from and adds a third ofa point to the value of the flat-letter grade for the minus and the plus, respectively. The Aplus and D-would have to be excepted, since a standard four-point scale with 1.0 as passing correlates with numerous other universities' grading scales. 
Matthew Fagan 
guest column 
Granted some teachers interpret the minus and the tlat-letter grade ranges separately and consider them of equal size:, while many ot· hers traditionally interpret the minus range as a subset ofa letter grade range in which it lies in the lower third. Hence, the tlat-letter grade 
Doonesbury 
range lies in the remaining two-thirds and is thus twice the size of the minus range. This traditional interpretation does not accurately coincide with the University's grading scale. One-halfpoint is deducted from the value ofa letter grade for a grade lyingin the lower third of that letter grade's range, yet no credit is given for a grade in the upper third. How could the difference between two con­secutive grade values be the same according to the University administration when this dif­ference in a teacher's evaluation is unequal? All teachers must be consistent among them­selves and with the administration. The plus whose range would lie in the upper third ofa letter grade would produce an equal dif­ference of one-third point between con­secutive grade values, and all teachers could evaluate the variable ranges, those ofplus flat­letter grade, and minus as one-third ofa letter grade range. 
Ofcourse the introductionofvariables into a grading scale creates more borderline situa­tions, but because a student would receive credit for earning a plus he would be more psychologically motivated to work harder for the added credit. Currently, if one of his grades lies in the middle of a letter grade range, a student is discouraged in trying to 
raise it to the minus range of the next letter 
grade because of the flat-letter grade range's 
large size. With the additional borderline 
created by the plus hope arises and remains 
within him to raise this grade into the next 
range or possibly higher. This motivation will 
help Notre Dame students improve their GPA, 
making them slightly more competitive for 
national competitions and scholarships. 
Finally, a student's GPA calculated from this new grading scale would more accurately reflect and evaluate his overall work. After all, companies and various graduate schools con­sider one's GPA as a vital part ofone's dossier, but because of the current grading scale, they underestimate a student's true ability. Shouldn't employers and school ad­ministrators know exactly what he is capable of? They do not realize that many times a stu­dent may have deserved a plus and thus deserved additional credit. He is being un· justly evaluated. His future career or further education depends highly on his GPA, and if ,that does not accurately retlect his efforts, 
what could? 

The addition ofthe plus in the grading scale 
would not only benefit the student but also 
the Notre Dame community. Astudent would 
be justly credited for his work effort which 
Garry Trudeau 

may increase as a result. Furthermore, this more accurate grading system would arouse the Notre Dame academic interest even greater -a seemingly impossible task.

Investment protests resemble past activism 
I had the advantage, and I am convinced that It was exacdy that, of having grown up In the '60s and having attended Berkeley in the final years of the '60s type ofstudent activism. A thought which began to strike me then and which has only been strengthened since Is how very traditional, and In that sense con­servative, "radical" student activism really was within the American context. 
Kern R. Trembath guest column 
Perhaps the most obvious traditional ele­ment of the '60s activists, and thus the way in which they were cut from the same cloth as those against whom they rebelled, was their shortsightedness. Rlldical student policies were usually as unable to project beyond tomorrow a..., were the government's own fordgn policies. In both cases, refusal to con· slder the future implications of policies and activities because of the perceived need to "do !IOmethlng quickly" resulted in failed policies, In a lack of confidence in those making policy and In a deterioration In the creative genius of those willing to participate in policy formation. The latter result was the most serious of all, of course, because it guaranteed a perpetuation of shortsightednes weU into the future. I am not sure that things have changed much within some of the cur­rent and quite appropriate discussions con­cerning Notre Dame's investment responsibilities towards South Africa. 
While there have been many catalysts for these thoughts, one in particular was a View­point letter. In It, the authors criticized Uni· verslty President Father Theodore Hesburgh's public resistence to divestment by means of three arguments. First, It presumed that other countries would fill the economic gaps left by departing American capital, leaving black South Africans no better off than before. Second, many Informed scholars do not ac· cept this "fill·in-the·gap" line of reasoning. And third, Notre Dame should not be left to wallow In the dust of the onrushing divest­ment bandwagon. Let us ignore the third reason a..~ merely a sophisticated version of "But Mom, everybody's doing it," and let us table the second reason until they show us that there are not many informed scholars on the other side of the argument. That leaves us with the first reason. 
Surely, it has struck others, in addition to me, that America's own history of fairly rapid racial Improvement over the last 30 years stands in exact opposition to their argument. Does no one remember that it was not until the power of the federal government was swung into place against the segregationist policies of (especially) the Southern states that America's apartheid system began to col­lapse? Does no one remember that it was not until Johnson's War on Poverty allocated massive doses offederal aid to those states and to black urban areas elsewhere that the phrase "black economic influence" began to be something other than a self-referential incon­sistency? Has no one noticed that it is espe­cially in so-called "free" countries that no groups can really be free uniess it has both the vote and access to economic capital? 
If these questions are anything other than rhetorical then they argue in favor ofour con­tinued economic presence in South Africa as our most tangible means ofexerting influence on that government to change its racist policies as well as our most concrete expres­sion ofsolidarity with impoverished blacks. If we wish to influence South Africa for the good we must not destroy our means of being able to do so. Obviously Pretoria is not Selma and South Africa is sovereign while the American South was not. That is, there are no specifi­cally judicial means by which we can change apertheid. But that means that we will have to use our remaining economic "weapons" all the more shrewdly; we cannot influence South Africa with weapons we have just thrown away. If you are as sick as I am of seeing blacks fighting with rocks and bottles against government tanks and cannons on one day, and then seeing those same blacks carry­ing their childrens' coffins to the cemetery the next, then do not fool yourself into thinking that divestment will give them more economic power. 
That brings us to the assertion by the aut· hoes that American divestment would be suffi­cient to exert persuasive influence on South Africa because it is "insulting" to the social concerns of the Japanese (South Africa's

largest export target) and the West Germans (her largest import supplier) to think that these or other countires would refill the capi­tal vacuum. In addition to the problem of thinking that countries design economic foreign policy exclusively around social con­cerns, there are other difficulties with this as­sumption. For one thing, the collision of an over-evaluated dollar with an under­evaluated rand within recent years has reduced America's overall investments in South Africa significantly and has reduced all foreign investments in new fixed-capital formation from 10 percent In 1982 to merely 
3.8 percent In 1984 (The Economist, 30 March 1985,p. 32). 
The South African recession during these years has not increased the country's foreign capital dependency as It has in so many other countries. In fact, its Interest payments on foreign loans are much lower as a percentage of exports than most third world countries and its "domestic savings ratio" is quite high, leading some South African economists and businessmen to encourage American divest­ment so that they can in turn buy out those investments at fire-sale prices. (And fire-sale they would be; the same issue of The Economist reports that a Massachusett's teac­her's union divested itself of S90 million of South African stocks In 1984 at a loss of Sll million to the teachers themselves. I wonder how many South African blacks are enjoying any of that S11 million. It seems as though both the teachers and the blacks got shafted.) And if South Africa would step in then other foreign countires would certainly follow suit to bolster their own recessed economies. The net result would be a greater control of the South African economy by South Africa itself and by its closest trading partners. The amount of time It would take to re-establish capital routes, resource supplies, factory productivity and export connections would be time during which all South Africans would suffer economic hardship. Black South Africans, however, are suffering enough as it is. One wonders why the authors want to in­crease it. 
Let me close by citing what resulted from the two major sanctions imposed on South Africa, the 1963 U.N. ban on weapons' sales and the 1977 ban on international sports com­petition. Granted that sanctions are not Identi­
cal to divestment, but surely there Is 
something to learn here. The weapons ban 
turned the country into a nearly self-sufficient 
weapons' producer, from about 40 percent 
self-sufficiency prior to the embargo to about 
85 percent now. Further, the same ban has 
resulted In a sharp increase In the technical 
sophistication of the weapons the country 
does produce and export and also, irony of 
ironies, a greater dependence upon other 
western military powers to provide for 
strategic defense (heavy land weapons, ships 
and airplanes) that It cannot provide for itself. 
Our military Is now stretched thinner at our 
expense precisely because our foreign policy 
will not allow South Africa strategically to 
defend Itself. Nor do we have any say In their 
export ofweapons-just ask Iran. 
The sports ban has resulted more obviously 
in racial Inequities. Several sports have been 
desegregated already by their governing 
bodies (cricket, soccer, boxing) even though 
these sports are not presently released from 
the boycott. Black soccer players In particular 
have suffered because the sport Is largely 
black, uniike rugby. This means that black SOC· 
cer players are denied access to International 
visibility and competition by the very nations 
which claim to support them. No wonder that 
so many end up on South American teams. 
The policy has failed to take account of its 
own succeses, that Is, the Improvement of 
specified conditions for blacks, and we are 
now boycotting black athletes. 
Those who ignore the past, whether here or in South Africa, will surely repeat Its mistakes. Universities ought to be the last place where such ignorance is approved, and if we divest we Ignore the fact that more presence means more influence and less presense means less, and we ignore as well the fact that no group Is fully free until It Is economically free. I en­thusiastically support the intentions of the authors to exert as much strangulation as pos­sible upon South Africn apartheid, but I fail to see how divestment will do that. The argu­ment is at least as strong that it will perpetuate that social evil.

Administration hinders students with its rules 
DearEditor: 
Are we children or adults? We are told we are now adults but are increasingly being treated like children. Notre Dame thinks that since we are no longer under the guidance of our parents, it should take on this respon· sibility. We say that It is not Notre Dame's to take. 
After walking in from class, we noticed a bulletin that stated parletals would start at midnight the weekend before finals. To add to this outrage, all "social gatherings" were prohibited for the weekend. This is just anot­her attempt by the administration to make our decisions for us. Shouldn't our choice ofstudy habits be up to us? Shouldn't It be our respon­sibility to decide when our social llfe should be suspended to study for finals? 
It is our opinion that the hierarchy ofNotre Dame should adhere to the policies of ad­ministration and leave the policies ofllving to the students.

NEW YORK-Dwight Gooden led the major leagues in victories, strikeouts and earned run average in 1985. He won 14 straight games and pitched 31 consecutive scoreless in­nings. He became the youngest modem big leaguer to win 20 games and earned the National League Cy Young award at the earliest age of any pitcher, ever. 
With all these accomplishments, what was his most memorable mo­ment of 1985? 
"When I hit the home run," he says. 
Soft-spoken and almost never given to hyperbole, the 21-year-old right-hander demurs from tooting his own horn, but the numbers trumpet his success. 
For his deeds, Gooden was voted The Associated Press' 1985 Male Athlete of the Year, winning over Chicago Bears running back Walter Payton by a large margin. In ballot­ing released Wednesday, Gooden received 53 votes in a nationwide poll of 221 sports writers and broadcasters; Payton had 39 votes.

MIAMI · The: Irish wrapped up 
fifth place In the Miami Burger King 
Classic with a 59-B victory over 
host Miami on jan. 5, the final day of 
the tournament in the Knight Sports 
Complex. 
Keys paced the Irish attack with 22 points, hitting on 10 of 17 shots from the field and pulling down eight rebounds, while: Ebben chipped in v.. ith I 0 points. Gavin had just two points, hut dished out five assists and made four steals while holding Miami high-scoring Maria Rivera to I 3 points. 
"Against Miami we: got a another good game from Mary, particularly dc:fc:nlilvc:ly," said DiStanislao. "We were fortunate because the three teams that we played in the tourna­ment all had their strongest player in the backcourt. 
"I was pleased to see us rebound from the opening loss and come back to play well." 
The game: was tied at I 5 after eight minutes, but the: Irish went on 
13·2 tear over the next seven 
linutc:s to take an I !·point lead. 
c:ys had eight ofthose points. 
Notre Dame kd 32-21 at the half 
and stretched its lead to as many as 
I5 points before Miami closed the 
gap to six in the final minute. Some 
cold shooting in the second half 
prevented Notre Dame from putting 
the game away. The Irish hit on just 
eight of 23 shots in the second half 
( 35 percent) after hitting 56 per­
cent in the first 20 minutes. 
Forward Hope Butler added 12 
points for Miami, but both she and 
Rivera fouled out in the final two 
minutes. Miami was plagued by poor 
shooting all afternoon, connecting 
on just 34 percent of its shots. 
ND 68, SW Texas 43 
MIAMI · Notre Dame got its most convincing victory since mid· December with a 68-43 win over Southwest Texas on jan. 4, the second day of the Miami Burger King Classic. 
Notre Dame did not shoot par­ticularly well, but outrebounded the Bobcats by a 51·38 margin to stay in in control of the game. Keys led a balanced Irish attack with 16 points and 10 rebounds, while Ebben added 1 0 points. 
"If you're going to play well you want to come away with a victory," said DiStanislo. "Against Southwest Texas State: we: played another good

game and came out on top." 
The Irish jumped out to a 23·6 
lead in the first 1 0 minutes of the 
game, and stretched that advantage 
to 39·16 at the half. The Bobcats got 
no closer than 21 points the rest of 
the way. 

The comfortable halftime lead 
enabled DiStanislao to give her 
reserves some playing time in the 
second half. Every Irish player saw at 
least 11 minutes of action in the 
game. 

Guard jackie Benson led the Bob· cats with 16 points, but no other player could net more than five points for Southwest Texas State. The Irish had seven players with at least six points. 
DiStanislao experimented with her starting lineup in the game, in· serting sophomore Beth Morrison at center in place of Botham, and sop· homore Kathy Barron at guard in place ofEbben. Morrison responded with seven points and five rebounds, while Barron addded four points and four rebounds. 
JMU 53, ND 51 
MIAMI · The Irish started off 1986 on the wrong foot, dropping a heartbreaking 53·51 decision to james Madison on the first day ofthe Burger King Classic. 
Notre Dame led 51-48 with 50 seconds left, but the Dukes got a driving layup from Donna Budd and a 12-footer from Julie Franken to take the lead. Keys' and Morrison's misses on the front end of one-and­ones in the final minutes proved costly, as Notre Dame did not score in the final 2:13. 
"We were up by three with 50 seconds left, but we hurt ourselves with an unwise shot with the shot clock winding down and by missing the front ends on those two one-and· one situations. Then (Lavetta Willis) fouled the shooter at the end, so we lost by two points. 
"On the last play we didn't get the necessary rotation from our defense so Franken was wide open for a shot. Those are the kind of mental errors you can't afford to make." 
The Irish led 24-21 at the half, but the Dukes took the lead for the first time since the opening minutes on a three-point play from forward Betsy Witman that put them up 30-28. 
Keys led the Irish with 20 points, while Botham added 11 points and seven rebounds before fouling out in the final minute:. The: Irish suf­fered through another poor shoot· ing night, hitting on just 40 percent oftheir shots for the afternoon.

UCLA 73, ND 67 

Talk about a grueling exam schedule. After a week of cramming for finals, the Notre Dame women's basketball team had to test Its mettle: Dec. 21 against Pac-1 0 power UCLA on the ACC court. 
It looked like the Irish had been up all night studying something else, however, as the Bruins took the sloppy home team to school, 73-67. With many errant passes, missed shots, and generally sluggish play, DlStanislao probably would have to give: her team an 'F, as in "flat". 
"We were: Oat because it was right after finals," she said. "We: killed our­selves with dropped passes, missed shots inside:, poor rebounding, and inopportune turnovers all over the floor." 
UCLA head coach Billie: Moore:, meanwhile, looked like a genius when he inserted reserve Jamie: Brown into the game midway through the first half with the two squads tied at 10 apiece. 
Brown tallied 10 points in the: remainder of the half to pace the 
...

Bruins to a 33·28 halftime margin. The role: player finished the contest with 16 points, leading the visitors In a well-balanced scoring attack. Brown's play off the: bench, coupled with a steady contribution from another reserve, Althea Ford (six points, four rebounds), surprised DiStanislao and kept her team from recording a much-needed big upset to impress the NCAA tournament committee: members. 
"UCLA is a volatile team," said DiS· tanislao. "They're an up-and-down shooting team, and some: of their people: who don't usually shoot well shot well against us." 
The: Irish were: led once again by DiStanislao's prize: pupil, Keys, who scored 22 points and hauled down six rebounds in the losing cause.

ND women's basketball team at 7-5 after home win against Marquette 
By MARlY BURNS 
and LARRY BURKE 
AsststontSportsEditors 
After a lengthy holiday road trip that saw them split four games, the Notre Dame women's basketball team was glad to return home to the ACC to face Marquette Monday night. The Irish made it a happy homecoming by defeating the War­riors, 75-42, to raise their record to 7-5.

Notre Dame's two-game winning 
~ 
streak came to a halt at Rutgers, however, as the Irish fell to the 18th­[ ranked Lady Knights, 69-61. "I thought we did some good
! things in Miami and at Rutgers," said Irish head coach Mary DiStanislao. "But we didn't put our entire game toaether every time on the floor. One game our intensity would be there but our execution wouldn't. Another game we just wouldn't have the intensity for the entire 40 minutes. We know what we have to improve if we want to win our con­ference title. We know that it is going to take an all-out etlort from each player ifwe want a shot at post­season play." Here is a recap of the last six Irish games: 
ND 75, Marquette 42 
The Irish were glad to be back on friendly ground Monday when they tipped otJ against Marquette at the ACC. Either that or they was just glad to be facing the Warriors. 
After a disappointing road trip over the semester break, the Irish were all smiles once again as they ad­ministered a 75-42 thrashing of the outmanned Warriors. The victory came as no surprise to Notre Dame, which hammered Marquette by 44 points earlier in the season, but it was a great homecoming nevenhe­less for head coach Mary DiStanis­lao's troops. 
"We played a pretty good game and it was great to be back here playing at home again," said DiS­tanislao. "But we're still far from ac­hieving real consistency in our performance." 
This consistency could be no problem for the Irish in their up­coming homestand against Nonh Star Conference foes if they get the same type of performance they showed against the Warriors. Sop­homore center Sandy Botham spurred a torrid first half for the home team as it shot 61 percent from the floor to take a 40-12 lead to the locker room at the intermission. 
The 6-2 center's 10 points and five rebounds keyed the Irish assault that inflated the score from 20-9 to 40-12 over the last six minutes of the half. On the defensive end of the court, Botham and Keys spearheaded an in­surmountable Notre Dame defense that limited the Warriors to a mere 17 percent shooting average from the floor. 
This onslaught by the Irish before the halfsealed the fate of Marquette and allowed DiStanislao to give her reserve players a good amount of playing time before the real con­ference race begins. Every player on the Notre Dame roster saw action, including freshman forward Heidi Bunek who scored four points in her first appearance since being sidelined since early December with a stress fracture. 
In addition to the solid perfor­mances by Keys ( 14 points, seven rebounds) and Botham ( 13 points, nine rebounds), the Irish got their usual good performances from point guard Mary Gavin (six assists) and shooting guard Lynn Ebben ( 12 points). Reserve forward Kathy Brommeland, meanwhile, con­tinued her fine play otlthe bench by contributing eight points and seven rebounds in 16 minutes ofplay. 
Rutgers 69, ND 61 

For 34 minutes and 59 seconds in New Brunswick, N.J., last Thursday it seemed the Notre Dame women's basketball team had salvaged its road trip and its NCAA tournament hopes. 
But that all came crashing down with a 1 5-foot shot by Rutgers' Janet Malouf that broke a 51-51 tie and gave the Lady Knights a lead they would never relinquish. The 69-61 final score raised the 18th-ranked Rutgers team's record and sank Irish hopes for a post-season tourney bid to an almost irretrievable depth. 
As a national power, Rutgers was one of the teams Notre Dame had to beat to make a legitimate claim as a tournament-caliber team. But Maloufs shot signaled the end ofthis particular upset dream as the Knights made enough free throws down the stretch to send the Irish home with a split for the road trip. 
The loss was hard to take for DiS­tanislao not so much because of the NCAA tournament situation, but more because she felt her team had lost control ofthe game. 
"We had the game in hand but we didn't make our shots in the paint," said the sixth-year Notre Dame men­tor. "In a tight game like this one, you've got to think about every possession. You can't atlord a lot of turnovers." 
DiStanislao may have been think­ing of Botham's three turnovers down the stretch that helped Rut­gers hang on until the final minute when it blew a 61-59 lead into the 69-61 final. These miscues, however, should not overshadow another fine performance by the big Irish center. Botham's 17 points and nine rebounds kept Notre Dame in the game on a day when the shots were not falling for many of her teammates. 
Ofcourse, the shots continued to fall for Keys, who poured in 29 points and grabbed seven boards to pace the Irish attack. In fact it was Keys' six straight points late in the seeond half that established the 51­51 deadlock that signified such great hope for her team. 
It was just not to be for Notre Dame, though, as the Knights hit 19 of 27 foul shots in the second half to maintain their lead.

Schottenheimer joins Holtz' coaching staff 
Special to the Observer 

BATON ROUGE, La. -Kun Schottenheimer has resigned im­mediately as linebacker coach at Louisiana State University to accept a similar job at Notre Dame, the Southeastern Conference school announced Wednesday. 
Schottenheimer, 36, helped sculpt one of the nation's most for­midable college defensive units while serving as an LSU assistant for two years. His brother, Many, is head coach of the Cleveland Browns' American Football Conference Central Division cham­pions. 
Born on Oct. 1, 1949, Schottenheimer is a native ofMe Donald, Pa. He is a graduate of Ft. Cherry High School and attended Coffeyville (Kan.) Junior College, where he was an All-American quarterback. Schottenheimer completed his collegiate career at Miami (Fla.), starting two seasons as a defensive back and graduating in 1971 with a bachelor's degree in Education. 
He began his coaching career in 1974 at William Paterson State College in NewJersey. In 1977, he joined the statlat Ridgefield Park (N.J.) High School, where he spent one season. He moved to Mic­higan State in 1978 and stayed with them through the 1982 season. 
Schottenheimer coached at Tulane in 1983. Married to the former Collen Dutly, the couple has one child ­Steele. 
Crowley dead at 83; last ofthe 'Four Horsemen' 

Elmer Layden, jim Crowley and Don Mtller. Crowley was the last surviving member ofthe four. 

SCRANTON, Pa. -Football great Jim Crowley, the last surviving member of Notre Dame's famed "Four Horsemen" of the 1920s, died in a nursing home Wednesday at age 83. 
"He's been ill for quite a while," Sister Patricia, director of Holy Family Residence, said, refusing to elaborate. 
Crowley was the left halfback in the backfield immonalized by sponswriter Grantland Rice after the Fighting Irish's 1924 victory over Army. Notre Dame went on to their first national championship and a victory over Stanford in the Rose Bowl. 
Besides Crowley, the backfield consisted of Elmer Layden at ful­lback, Don Miller at right haltback and Harry Stuhldreher at quarter­back. 
Crowley said being the last of the Four Horsemen left him with "a very lonesome feeling." 
~·we used to get together quite of­ten," he said in 1980. "The last time I saw Don Miller was at Yale when we were honored in the winter of 1979." Miller died later that year. 
Crowley said Rice's designation of the Notre Dame backfield as the Four Horsemen didn't really register with him at first. 
"I thought, to be truthful, it was a nice article. I didn't think it would become a legend," he said. 
After leaving Notre Dame, Crowley coached Fordham Univer­sity to the Cotton and Sugar bowls, and coached a line that, because of its defensive prowess, became known as the Seven Blocks of Granite. One member of that line was tbe late National Football League Coach Vince Lombardi. 
Crowley later became president of the now defunct All American Football Conference and coach­owner ofthe AFL's Chicago Rockets. He worked for an import company, was industrial commissioner of Lackawanna County, which includes Scranton, and sat on the Pennsyl­vania State Athletic Commission. 
Crowley "was everyone's friend," said Edward "Moose" Krause, ath­letic director at Notre Dame for 34 years and a close friend. "He had wit, charm and s.tyle. He was gracious and warm, and he wore his success with a great deal ofhumility.
