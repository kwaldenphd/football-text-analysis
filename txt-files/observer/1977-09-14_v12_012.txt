Leopold StokOUJSki dies 
LONDON -Leopold Stokowski, former conductor of the Philadelphia Symphony, died yesterday at the age of 95. 
The untiring musician was reportedly working until the end, preparing for a recording session in the fall. He had made more _than 20 LPs since his 90th birthday, and only last year signed a contract that would have kept him busy until he was 100. 
Stokowski built his reputation in nearly 25 years at the helm of the Philadelphia Orchestra, starting in 1912. Critics ranked him with the late Arturo Toscanini and the late Serge Koussevitsky as the titans of symphonic art.

Badin laundromat offers 'clean' alternative 
Ed Callahan 
Male students finding their weekly wash load becoming too expensive at the campus laundry now have another option: the Badin Laundromat. 
In preceding years, men were often seen sneaking in a load of clothes at one of the women's dorms, or conning a lady friend into doing to for them. Now that they have their own facilities for wash­ing many are taking advantage of them. 
"1 do my two dollar sixty cents worth at the school laundry, but I only send over jeans and towels. They have a tendency to crush buttons when they press my shirts," commented a freshman launderer. 
Overall, the majority of users are pleased with the performance so far this year. "I can come down here. wash my weekly overload, and get some work done at the same time," one user noted. 
The laundromat is equipped with six desks, six washers, six driers, and three vending machines with refreshments. 
However several students ex­pressed the need for both a moneychanger and a coin-operated detergent machine. 
For some first time visitors were surprised to find that they had to bring their own detergent. Brother Ryan, vice-president of Business Affairs, said that he wouldjefinitely look into the prospect of a det~r­gent machine. 
The outlook for a moneychanger is less optimistic. 
"With the mens' laundry open twenty-four hours a day, the in­stallation: of a 'change machine would be an open invitation to vandalism," Ryan stated. 
Complaints have also been ex­pressed about the driers. 
"One load takes at least two runs throught the drier, sometimes ­more on a heavy bundle, "men­tioned a patron with an armload of damp clothes. 
The driers run anywhere from ten minutes to an hour reported

time is approximately 28 minutes. 
''The driers are all commercially 
set for standard times by the firm 
that owns them,"added Ryan. "It 
is the same time found in regular 
laundromats." 
The machines thus far have not 
needed any major repairs. 
"There wasn't any hot air in one 
drier for a while and another one 
didn't work at all, but those 
obviously have been taken care 
of, "reported one Badin regular. 
"The machines also have an occa­

ers with no results which hurts at 
such a high price." 
Weekend afternoons are usually 
peak washing times, but usually no 
more than four to six people are 
there at most other time preiods. 
"We would like to keep the 
number of machines where it is 
now" said Ryan. 
"We are hoping that the stu­

for the machines if they want to

WASHINGTON [AP] -President Carter signed an order yesterday setting up the Department of Energy and immediately began naming the officials to help lead it. 
He told a news conference that creation of the department fulfilled a campaign pledge to begin reor­ganizing the federal goverment. 
The new department, whose first annual budget will total almost $10.4 billion, will include almost 20,000 employees when it starts operations Oct. 1. 
Carter noted that gasoline con­sumption reached a new high this summer and oil imports have continued to increase despite the many public warnings of potential energy shortages. He said new efforts would be necessary to stimulate energy conservation and additional production.

More about Mr. Lance 
Washing ton [AP] -The chief bank regulator in Atlanta was quoted yesterday as saying Bert Lance wanted to know long before the 1976 election what could be done about federal restreictions on his bank if he was named to a high post in the Carter administration. 
But Donald L. Tarleton, the Atlanta regional comptroller who eventually dropped those restric­tions, denied the account after it was released by the Senate Govern­mental Affairs Committee. And another witness said he did not recall that part of the conversation. 
Sen. Charles H. Percy, (R-111.), introduced an affidavit by banking examiner Charles Francis Stuart that recounted a meeting with Tarleton and another bank exami­ner in Atlanta on May 13, 1976. That was five months before a "cease and desist" agreement with the Calhoun First National Bank was lifted by Tarleton and seven months before Lance became bud­get director. 
The Internal Revenue Service, the United States, Lance would be nominated to a high position in the Carter administration. 
"Mr. Tarleton further stated that one of Lance's banks was under an agreement with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; that Lance spoke with him Tarleton about what could be done to deal with the agreement in the event an FBI background investigation materialized." 
A spolesman for Lance said the budget director would respond when he testifies before the com­mittee Thursday and Friday. 
Lance and Carter held their regular weekly meeting yesterday. A White House spokesman said they did not discuss whether Lance should resign. 
.:farleton repeated his assertion that--Lance had never asked him to lift tho restrictions on the bank. 
Thomas C. Brown, the other bank examiner present, said in another affidavit that he remem­bers Tarleton saying Lance proba­bly would get a high government position but does not remember

New check cashing policy allows students $50 cash 
by Laurie Lee Foss Staff Reporter 
A new check cashing policy at the cashier's office in the Administration Building will go into effect Sept. 19, accord­ing to Tom Soma, Student Body vice president. The new policy enables working stu­dents to cash checks up to $50, 
an increase over the previous limit of $35. 
Soma submitted the propos­al to Bro. Kieran Ryan, assist­ant vice president for Business Affairs, at the request of several student employees. Due to this year's increase in wages for dining hall workers, many paychecks exceeded the previous limit. 

Students react in favor of Roots Progra_m in city 
by Maureen Eyres Staff Reporter 
Response to the Neighborhood Roots Program is "overwhelming" according to Valerie Hardy, Stu­dent Union commissioner of Social and Interracial Concerns. A cross­section of 226 students and 65 alumni, faculty, and their spouses will participate in the orientation to the South Bend Community to be held this Thursday. 
The sponsors, CILA, the Center 
for Experiential Learning, adn the 
Urban Studies Program, had origi­
nally projected a goal of 250 
participants. 
For students who have signed 
up, the program will begin at the 
Library Circle at 4:10p.m. and not 
at the Main Circle at 4:30 p.m. as 
reported in last Wednesday's Ob­
server. 
At this time students will be 
assigned to cars for the neighbor­
hood tours to be conducted by 
alumni, faculty, and their spouses 
and will receive information pac­
kets. 
After the tour, the groups will 
meet at the AB Falcon Club at 
approximately 5:20 p.m. for a 
traditional Polish wedding meal 
followed by talks on various aspects 
and issues of the neighborhood. 
Return to campus will be at 
approximately 8:30 p.m. 
Fast earns money 
The World Hunger Coalition's Wednesday-night fast program will begin next week. The fast, which began two years ago as a fund-rais­ing project, has raised approxim­ately $8,000 per year to help alleviate world hunger. 
Of the money collected, three­
fourths has gone for overseas relief 
and one-fourth has been contribu­
ted to the poor in South Bend. 
Agencies such as CARE and 
OXF AM are funded by the Hunger 
Coalition. 
Sign-up sheets will be distribut­
ed tonight and Thursday night at 
the dining halls. 
Registered students are remin­ded to purchase their tickets for $1.00 at the Student Government Office. If this arrangement is impossible, tickets can be picked up at the Library Circle on Thurs­day prior to departure. 

Laundry bundles limited to one 
by Lou Severino 
Students who use more than one 
laundry bundle per week will be 
required to pay cash for the extra 
bundles, as a result of policy 
changes announced by the Laundry 
Service. 
Laundry Director Adloph Keglo­
vits stated that, ''Quite a few 
students put three or four bundles 
down in one week last year which 
slowed up service considerably." 
This occurred quite often later in 
the semester last year, according to 
Keglovits. As a result, this year's 
students will be allowed fifteen 
bundles, one for each week of the 
semester. 
Junior Jeff Smith, commenting 
on the new policy, stated that "It is 
unfair to pay thirty-nine dollars for 
laundry and not be allowed to get 
service equal to that amount.'' 
Another change deals with carry­
down laundry. These bundles, 
brought to the laundry by students 
will not be processed until the 
week's work has been completed. 
Keglovits attributed this rule to the 
laundry tyring to maintain an even 
flow and equalize the work load. 
A third change deals with lost 
laundry cards. A duplicate will cost 
five dollars as compared to last 
year's no charge. Keglovits esti­
mated that seven hundred dupli­
cate cards were made last year. 
''This change in policy will help to 
insure better overall service anc 
fewer paperwork problems," he 
said. 
Keglovits stressed that, "The 
laundry tries to offer the best 
service possible to the students 
although problems do arise at 
times."

SMC Octoberfest featu1res Biergarten . _ 
by Am11e Baeble 
Plans for the fourth annual Oktoberfest, to be held Sept. 28 ­Oct. 1, are well underway, accord­ing to Oktoberfest Chairman Kathy 
Friday.  The  traditional  event,  
sponsored by  St.  Mary's  Social  
Commission  was  initiated  as  an  

autumn counterpart to An Tostal. 
Usually held in mid-October, Oktoberfest '77 has been pushed ahead this year so as not to interfere with mid-terms, and also to better coincide with its larger counterpart in Germany. 
During the last week in Septem­ber, t-shirts and raffle tickets for a Pioneer stereo will be sold in the dining halls on both campuses. For those 21 and older, Oktoberfest will begin Wednesday night with beer specials.at s~:!nior Bar. 
St. Mary"s students will get involved Thursday with a German dinner in the dining hall, complete with German polka band and skits performed by the students. The winner of th~:! hall decorating contest will be announced at this time. Gil Eagles, a magician, will perform for all interested students Thursday night. 
A-happy hour at the Library Friday will be highlighted with various contests. That night St. Mary's will sponsor a dance in Regina Hall, with the band "Sa­hara" playing, while the north lounge of Regina will hold a Biergarten complete with balloons ~d pretzels for tho~e with 2_1 JP~· 
Admission to the dance and Biergarten is $2, while the dance alone will cost $1. 
A Groucho Marx look-alike con­test, to be held that evening, will permit anyone dressed like Grou­cho to be admitted free. The one judge to "look mos! alike" will be awarded a prize. 
The weekend will be capped with the Michigan State game Saturday, and a concert that evening. 
Anyone desiring to help with sign-making and other activities should meet in the St. Mary's Social Commission office in the basement of Regina Sunday at 3 p.m.

HOW DOES A $299Advent, SO~NY. ,U)0(9" STER.E0. s·OUND ? , IMPRESSIVE! 

Our new $300 stereo system Is really a spectacular bargain, designed to blow your mind but not your budget. 
The amazing system is built around some incredible loud­speakers from the Advent Corporation, the company that has a reputation for making better and better speakers for less and less 
money. 

The Advent 3 speakers are a two way acoustic suspension design whose basic operation is much like that of Advenrs more expensive speaker sys­tems. Its woofer's cone is free to move over a great distance to push air effectively for good bass response, and it has a heavy and expensive magne­tic structure that permits ex­cellent undlstorted output. A precise cone tweeter assures clear highs with excellent dispersion. 
To drive these little gems, we've chosen the Sony StR 1800 receiver. If you're into FM, the tuner section of the StR 1800 has all the ciraJitry and features you'll need for drift-free, clear FM reception. 
And If you're inclined to listen to Chicago stations the Sony 1800 receiver will sur­prise you and disappoint the cofT1)etition. 
The turntable is the now famous BIC 920 ready to play 
·with moulded base and an Audio Technica cartridge. It will take good care of your records and get all the sound they have to offer playing after playing. 
These components would sell separately for $415; we offer you the complete system for $299. The price Includes assembly and the services only Audio . Specialists can offer.

"Looks beautiful from chase," radioed the pilot of one of the comparatively tiny jets that flew alongside the 75-ton glider. 
Yesterday's flight was a preview of how the Shuttle's earth-orbit space-flight will end-not with the ocean-splash down of previous manned missions but with an airplane-style soar through the atmosphere and a runway landing. 
"That sure was fun," came the word from Enterprise after space­craft commander Joe Engle, 45, and copilot Richard Truly, 41, brought the rolling craft to a stop after a dusty dry lake landing. 
At a press briefing later, the flight was described as "essentially per­fect,' by the test program manager, Donald K. Slayton, who added, "We're ready to go again." 
Engle and Truly praised the Shuttle for its handling qualities and said that each of them had had about equal time at the craft's controls. 
"There really weren't any sur­prises in flying the aircraft," Truly added. 
Two other astronauts had guided the craft during its first free flight Aug. 12. Yesterday's cruise was much the same except that Engle and Truly used the cockpit controls to put the stubby winged Shuttle through maneuvers.

Lacrosse clinic 
The second week of the lacrosse clinic is well underway and with this added practice, the team is showing signs of gelling. The idea of the clinic, a first for the lacrosse team, came from the club's presi­dent, Rich Mazzei, who wanted to spark interest in the club. The result has been overwhelming as many students have turned out for the clinic. 
The majority of the people who 
join, do not know that much about 
playing the sport, if any at all. 
Learning to throw and catch the 
ball with a modified "butterfly net" 
is quite a challenge. 
Even though the clinic is in its .second week, anyone wishing to 
come out for the team is still 
encouraged to do so. Basic 
maneuvers are now being empha­
sized and sticks are provided. The 
clinics are held at 4:30 p.m. on

Dorsett and Cowboys set to run for NFC crown 
The National Football League opens its 1977 season this Sunday afternoon with all 28 of its teams dreaming of a possible berth in Super Bowl XII. For some teams, these dreams are mere fantasy; other squads, however, may be just a player or two away. Here's one_ look at the National Football Con­ference teams: 
NFCEAST Dallas Cowboys -Everyone knows the Cowboys have Tony Dorsett, but they also have a lot more. Last Thursday they trounced the Steel­crs by a 30-0 count in exhibition play. Steeler quarterbacks were sacked 8 times. The defense is ,·oung and ferocious and the of­fense. with Dorsett, is sound. The Cowboys should battle for the NFC ,-rown. St. Louis Cardinals -This Cardinal team is not all that different from their past teams. The Big Red nffense is the best in the NFC, but ·he defense is again porous. Terry \1etcalf. Mel Gray, Ike Harris, Jim Otis and Jim Hart should put many points on the board for the Cards. On defense, the linebacking is poor and Norm Thompson no longer patrols the left corner. Overall. the Cards should be carried to another winning season by their offense but their defense may again keep them from the playoffs. Washington Redskins -George Allen· s over-the-hill gang seems to have leveled off in the past few seasons. Though Allen recently hrought in Mike Curtis, his defense will be hurt by the loss of linebacker Chris Hanburger. He had his appendix removed and will be lost for the early portion of the year. The offense is again in the hands of Billy Kilmer, who will be 
aided by running back Mike Tho­mas and wide receiver Frank Grant. Allen's special teams should be worth a few wins and this team should finish a notch or two above .500. Philadelphia Eagles -The Eagles have traded away so many of their top draft choices in the past few

Swimmers set 

to meet 
Any students interested in the varsity swimming team are urged to attend an organizational meeting on Thursday, September 15th in the foyer of the Rockne Building (2nd floor). Freshmen are to report at 4 p.m., while all upperclassmen should arrive at 5 p.m. 

Wrestlers too 
There will be a meeting for all those interested in participating on the varsity wrestling team on Wednesday, September 14 at 4:30 
p.m. in the ACC Auditorium. Those who cannot attend the meeting but are interested in the program should call Coach Sepeta at 7421, Mike at 1598 or Pat at 8721. 

Weightlifting anyone? 
There will be an organizational meeting of the Weightlifting Oub this Wednesday, September 14, at 4 p.m. in the weightlifting room o the ACC. All interested students are asked to attend. 
Weightlifting at Notre Dame has become a university funded club sport, in which qualified lifters will be competing against other schools. Categories of competition include the bench press, deadlift, squat lift and a total weight category. Interested lifters can choose to compete in any one category or in any combination. 
yeats that there is little young 
talent on their roster. Ron Jawor­
ski is a fine addition to the offense, 
but Charley Young is an even 
greater loss. Bill Bergey is still the 
best in the NFL in the middle, but 
there are no solid linemen in front 
of him. Dick Vermeil's coaching 
should mean a few victories but the 
Eagles still have much rebuilding 
to do. 
New York Giants -The biggest 
question with the Giants is at the 
quarterback position. Jerry Gol­
steyn seems to have won the job, 
but even he is an unproven 
quantity. Larry Csoka's knee is not 
yet 100 percent and the offensive 
line is mediocre. The Giant 
defense. on the other hand, ranks 
a:nong the best in the NFC. If they 
aren't on the field all game, they 
can do the job. The Giants will be 
hard pressed to win games because 
they can't .score with any regular­
ity. 
NFCCENTRAL 
Minnesota Vikings -The Vikings 
are now ready to take the "Can't 
win the big one" monicker from the 
Raiders. Though the Vikes have 
won the Central Division title in 
eight of the past nine seasons, they 
have yet to win the Super Bowl. 
The offense still has the firepower 
with Fran Tarkenton, Chuck Fore­
man and Sammy White. The 
defense was embarrassed by Oak­
land in last year's Super Bowl, and 
it could be beaten often this 
season. The Vikes will win their 
division but will be stopped in the 
playoffs. 
Chicago Bears -The Bears had a fine season in 1976 and they should continue to improve. They have fine personnel at all but two 
positions, quarterback and middle linebacker. Good output from the players who man these positions will help the Bears to make the playoffs. With the loss of Lionel Antoine and Wally Chamber's uncertain status, several untested players must perform well for the Bears to make a serious title run. Detroit Lions -The Lions have been an average football team for the past five seasons, this year they may be ready to break that mold. Dexter Bussey, Horace King, Law­erence Gaines and recently acquir­ed Marv Hubbard give the Lions a stable of fine running backs. If the line holds up this quartet should garner a lot of yardage. Greg Landry is an effective quarterback. The defense is good though the secondary may be vulnerable. The Lions should fight with the Bears 
and the Cards for the wild  card  
playoff berth.  
Green  Bay  Packers   Bart  Starr  

enters his third year with the Packers but the situation in Green Bay has improved little since he has taken over the coaching reins. Lynn Dickey is a good QB and Willard Harrel and Ken Payne are exciting offensive performers, but they can't do it all by themselves. Top draft choices Mike Butler and Ezra Johnson should improve the defense but much work still needs

SMC Coaching Changes 
by Laurie Reising Women's Sports Editor 
Along with the new Angela Athletic Facility, St. Mary's has many new coaches this year. 
Field Hockey, now a varsity sport, will be headed by Karen Grummell. Grummell, a graduate of Purdue University and who holds a masters degree from Indiana University, has been coaching and teaching physical education for seven years. Currently, she is assistant tennis pro at local La Fayette South tennis club. Grum­mell will have her work cut out for her this season as the team runs up against some stiff competition in the form of Marion, Valparaiso, Goshen and Notre Dame. 
Monica Brown, a second year law student at Notre Dame, will be directing the gymnastics squad. Brown is not entirely new to the St. Mary's campus for she helped in gymnastics classes last year. A native of Belleview, Washington, she is a graduate of Seattle University where she founded the women's gymnastics team. 
Another club sport that will be making its debut on the varsity level is softball. And there to make sure it starts out with a winning season will be new St. Mary's coach, Carolyn Willig. Willig, ~.ho 
will also be directing the basketball team, holds a degree in physical education and journalism from Purdue University where she parti­cipated in basketball. She also earned a masters in physical educa­tion from Ball State while serving as the university's women's sports information director. Last year she taught at Penn High School in Mishawauka. 

The athletic program at St. Mary's has grown tremendously over the years to nine varsity sports, necessitating the need for some assistance in the athletic director's office. Filling this posi­tion will be Jane Lammers, a recent graduate of Notre Dame. Jane will long be remembered at Notre Dame, for along with Betsy Fallon, she founded the women's tennis team. Her job as assistant director will be only part time, the other half is spent working for Campus Ministry and as coach of St. Mary's swimming team, for not only is Jane a gifted tennis player but an excellent swimmer as well. She hs been swimming competitively for 10 years out of Dayton Country Club where she was also captain of its team and voted most valuable swimmer, 1970-71. 
Sister Katherine Reichert is pro­
[cootinued on page 7] to be done. The Pack is still not back. Tampa Bay Buccaneers · The Bucs have yet to win their first NFL regular season game, but they should get that this year. John McKay's home for USC alumni is growing as he now has Anthony Davis and Ricky Bell in the fold. These two should generate the running game that the Bucs never had last year. Defensively, the Selmon brothers are the only true standouts. It should be another long season for the Buccaneers. 

NFCWEST Los Angeles Rams -Most people feel this is the season for the Rams, after all Joe Namath is now making his residence in sunny California. The Rams again have a fine team, but Namath may not be the savior they have been looking for. Larry Brooks, Jack Youngblood and Monte Jackson head a superb defensive unit. On offense all the tools are there but behind the

There is an interesting show 

developing within the National 
Basketball Association. It stars 
Larrybrien, Jamaal Wilkes and the 
Los Angeles Lakers. The plot 
centers around the signing of 
Jamaal Wilkes by the Lakers. The 
former UCLA star forward played 
out his option with the Golden State 
Warriors last season, hoping to be 
picked up specifically by Jack Kent 
Cooke's west coast enterprise. 
There is a problem, though. 

According to compensation rules, 
the Lakers must compensate the 
Warriors for Wilkes' departure and 
that could be tough. Golden State 
wants nothing less than Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar and is unwilling to 
accept a multi-player transaction. 
It is up to Commissioner O'Brien 

to settle the situation and decide 
who or what goes where. From this 
point of view, it seems likely that 
the Warriors will have to settle for 
someone in the category of recently 
signed Ernie Digregorio or Cazzie 
Russell. The Warriors have to be 
dreaming if they think that the loss 
of Wilkes is worth a Jabbar in 
return. In this sense, Commission­er O'Brien does not have as tough a decision to make as first perceived. 
Last week, the Jerry Tarkanian 

situation was briefly touched upon. 
Since that time, the NCAA in­
formed the University of Nevada­
Las Vegas of its recommendation to 
suspend Tarkanian from his bas­
ketball coaching duties. 
But a local judge in Las Vegas 

issued a temporary restraining 
order prohibiting such action. And 
furthermore, Tarkanian has filed 
suit against the University claiming 
that his 14th amendment rights 
were violated by the University, its 
president, Dr. Donald Baetler and 
the University's Board of Regents.

center. If Namath or Haden can do the job, the Rams will be unbeat­able. If they are adequate, the Rams will win their division but fail to reach the Super Bowl. San Francisco 49ers -Joe Thomas moves out to the Bay area to see if he can work his magic and build another championship caliber team. Monte Clark is gone after a fine opening season, but Ken Meyer has solid coaching creden­tials. Jim Plunkett leads the offense, hopefully he will snap out of the passing slump that plagued him during the 1976 campaign. The defensive line stands out with messers. Hardman, Hart, Elam, and Webb harrassing enemy quar­terbacks. If the passing game is good, the 49ers will surprise. New Orleans Saints -Hank Stram enters his second season in the Superdome with a team that is slowly beginning to resemble his old Chiefs. Stram has always liked big linemen and he is doing his best to beef up the Saints' lines. Top draft choices Joe Campbell (6-6,250) and Mike Fultz (6-5, 278) make Stram's defensive line large indeed. Their presence will give the defense a big lift. Archie Manning is fully recovered from his injury problems and is ready to put the Saints offensive into high gear. The Saints are improved and are ready to spring more than their share of upsets this season. Atlanta Falcons -Leeman Bennett is the new Falcon coach and he 

certainly has a long road to travel before the Falcons can be consider­ed contenders. Steve Bartkowski is lost with a knee injury and the rest of the offense is poor. Claude Humphrey is still at defensive end, but his old friend, Tommy Nobis has hung up his cleats. There will be many new faces in Atlanta this year but few of them will be in the stadium seats. 
Wild Card: Bears 
NFC Champs: Cowboys 

Tarkanian maintains that he is a 
tenured professional employee of 
the university and should hold a 
continuing appointment there as 
head basketball coach and profes­
sor of physical education 
Actually, the NCAA had told Nevada-Las Vegas to suspend Tar­kanian or else face a reprimand more severe than the two years of probation already tacked on. This latter option mentioned by the NCAA indicates a misuse of its won powers in trying to nail one man. Jerry Tarkanian deserved to be caught by the NCAA for recruiting violations but the NCAA must now justify its actions and strive for consistency across the board when­ever similar occurences arise. In other words, all college coaches found guilty of recruiting violations should be dealt with as harshly. 
It wasn't too surprising when Univesity of San Francisco Basket­ball Coach Bob Gaillard announced his resignation effective at the end of the upcoming season. It was a known fact that he had problems controlling his players, especially free-spirited James Hardy. Gaillard cited time away from his 
family as his reasons for stepping down but footnoted that with the notion that the Dons had now built their basketball program into a great one but he was losing his motivation to sustain the basketball program at its current level. 
He also admitted that when hired as an assistant 10 years ago, he didn't want the job in the first place. Now's a fine time for him to admit that. It's probably more a 
case of sour grapes following the consecutive losses at the end of last season to Notre Dame and Nevada­Las Vegas.
