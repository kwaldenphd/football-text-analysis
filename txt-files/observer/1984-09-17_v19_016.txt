Saint Mary's to hold phone-a-thon for college 
ByJULIA HEWSON 
News Staff 
A mini phone-a-thon is to be held Sept. 24 and 25 to help kick-off Dr. Duggan's new 25 million dollar fund raising campaign for Saint Mary's. Senior Julie Strazzabosco, Student Body Vice President for academic affairs, has been selected to organize the event and says she hopes to raise S80,000. This phone-a-thon is to be a small supplemental version of the larger, full scale effort planned for spring with the money being put into an unrestricted fund for Saint Mary's. Julie has recruited 30 volunteer callers representing all four classes at Saint Mary's. The event will take place in room 303 of the Haggar College Center between 6 and 9p. m. so that callers may reach all the time zones across the nation at reasonable hours. 
The volunteers wiU be calling alumnae, parents, and friends of the college. Their ultimate goal is to persuade people to join the An­niversiary Club with a donation of between S140 and S499, or the Tower Club with a donation from S500 to S999.

Princess Diana, smiling to a cheering crowd, took home from the hospital yesterday her one-day-old second son, Henry Charles Albert David. The baby, third in line to the British throne, will be known to his family simply as Harry. The princess blushed as the crowd of about 1,000 people, some of whom had waited through the night outside London's St. Mary's Hospital, waved Union Jacks and called out, "Hurrah, Harry!" The royal couple's first child, two-year-old Prince William, visited his mother and baby brother at the hospital for 1 5 minutes earlier. The speed of the announcement of the names of the 6-pound, 14-ounce baby aroused speculation the princess knew from medical tests that it would be another boy. -AP 
Howard H. BakerJr., in the final weeks of his IS­year career as a senator, is making one last stab in his uphill campaign to admit television cameras to the Senate chamber. It's unlikely his colleagues will give the Republican leader from Tennessee his wish as a going-away present, but they will probably agree to end a threatened filibuster and might vote to allow radio coverage, Senate sources say. Procedural obstacles inthe Senate are blocking consid­eration of spending bi!~. including a military construction measure that is expected to touch off a debate over U.S.-built air bases in Honduras. Meanwhile, four major environmental bills are waiting in the wings for possible action, although all are threatened by the clock, since Congress is scheduled to adjourn on Oct. 4. -AP

The Great Gobbler Gallop in worthington, 
Minn. Saturday was won by a turkey named Paycheck, from Wor­thington, with a time of I minute, 19.85 seconds over the 150 yard course. Ruby Begonia of Cuero, Texas, lost Saturday's race through downtown Worthington, but will get another chance in the second heat, held Oct. 7 in Cuero during that city's Turkeyfest. The bird with the best combined time wins the Traveling Turkey Trophy of Tumultuous Triumph and its home city assumes the title of"Turkey Capital of the World" for a year. The race started slowly, with both birds jumping into the crowd and having to be retrieved. Wor­thington, once undisputed "turkey capital of the world," began the Turkey Day celebration in 1939. Some years ago, officials in Cuero challenged Worthington's status, and the turkey race evolved to set­tle the dispute. To date, Minnesota entries have won seven races and Texas birds have won four. -AP

Keeping things in perspective 
Interview with a certain campus column, which granted the interview on the condition it notbe identi­fied: 
Q: So, when exactly did you appear in The Observer? 
A: Oh, quite early in the semester. 
Q: What was the date? 

A: Hey, you don't think I'm stupid, do you? That'd be too easy, I mean, there was only one other article besides myself that day, and -Oops. Well, I'd better not say anymore. See, you got me already. You dirty journalist. 
Q: As you know, your appearance caused somewhat ofa stir among the younger members of the Notre Dame community, notably one member in particular who chose to write to The Observer to express his opinion. 
A: Yeah, well, that wasn't my intention. I was just hoping to brighten up someone's day, ynu know, maybe make a few people laugh while they were trying to swal­low dining hall lunch. I saw the letter he wrote, and I'm just sorry my point was missed. It wasn't supposed to be at anyone's expense. 
Q: Apparently some people were more sorry than you, though. His letter attracted a lot of flak from other young members ofthe NO commu­nity, and even made him the victim of various pranks and some anonymous phone calls. 

A: That's a shame that some people had to respond in such fashion. I read the let­ters in response to his letter, and I'll admit the satirical elements in each made me a little proud. However, things like crank calls are completely uncalled for. Like I said, I never meant to cause any trouble. I'm just your average column who wanted to make someone laugh a little. 
Q: That's not all, though. Now it appears there's a letter in response to the letters that were in response to the first letter. 
A: You're kidding. 
Q: No, I'm afraid I'm not. The stir isn't quite over yet. 
A: Great. You know, I think people are taking this whole thing and each other much too seriously. 
Q: What do you mean? 

A: What I mean is that this whole mess probably should have ended with the first letter. I thought the letter was kind of silly, but/ wasn't going to say anything about it. It was funny when someone did, but it really wasn't nec­essary. Now the situation is rebounding back and forth like a tennis match, and pretty soon we're gonna have responses to responses to responses, and it's getting ridiculous, you know? It's a terrible shame that I was

misunderstood in the first place. It just shouldn't have been that big ofa deal. 
Q: I agree. But why are you so worried about the con­troversy anyway? Aren't columns supposed to attract that sort of thing? 
A: Well, not necessarily. We're all different, you know. I could see an Inside Column not being too concerned about a little controversy, and Sports Columns are taught to tolerate it from the moment they're born. Edi­torial Columns -well, you know those guys. They thrive 
on starting a little furor here and there. But I've got a lot of friends who are Editorial Columns, so I'd better just shut up about that. With me, though, it was just the fact that I never intended to start anything. I mean, I can take criticism as well as the next column, but this little my­daddy-can-beat-up-your­daddy war is just crazy. 
Q: What should be done? 

A: First ofall, people have to stop taking things so seriously. There are obvi­ously some things you should take seriously, but something like me should have been perceived as satirical. You can't get 
through this place without a sense of humor. Things don't follow logically here. Including me, I guess. 
Q: Would you like to add anything else? 

A: Yeah, everybody should go and see "Purple Rain," and start listening more to Prince. He thinks the same way I do. We're all going to die someday, so why not have fun while you're here? Like the saying goes, life is too important to be taken seriously.

United Auto Workers union, General Motors resume talks 
Associated Press 
DETROIT -The United Auto Workers union and General Motors Corp. resumed contract bargaining yesterday with the company under increasing pressure from spot strikes against 13 GM plants. 
The walkouts were called after the UAW contract with the world's largest manufacturer expired at mid­night Friday. Most of the targeted plants would have been closed for the weekend even without the strikes. 
But yesterday, the action already had closed one plant where there was no strike, putting about 5,000 hourly employees out ofwork. 
"Buick's not building cars and can't use the bodies, and we have nowhere to store them," said Fred Craig, spokesman for the Fisher­Guide division body plant in Flint, Mich., the city hardest hit by the strikes. 
.Craig said the workers were sent home without layoff notices. The union said it would encourage its members to apply for layoffbenefits, which vary from state to state. 
Full production had been sched­uled for this morning, and if the walkouts continued many of the more than 100 GM supply plants soon would have no place to ship their products. 
VAW president Owen Bieber arrived in the ornate lobby of GM headquarters just before I 0 a.m. yes­terday, saying, "there's some tough issues still up there," referring to the bargaining rooms. 
Several union sources, however, said progress was being made on job security and wages, the union's top two issues, and a settlement could forthcoming before today's full shifts. 
On Saturday night, GM bargainer Pat Crane, in response to a question on when a there might be a settle­ment, replied "probably tomorrow." 
Crane, however, was out of sight yesterday. 
The UAW has said the main issue in the talks in job security, a bid to keep the automakers from farming out work to plants overseas. It also is seeking wage and benefit increases, including the first raise in three years of its 59.63-per-hour basic wage. lbe union gave up billions of

dollars in contract concessions two years ago when the industry was losing money. 
About 62,000 of the 350,000 workers covered by the pact walked off their jobs when the contract expired. 
Twelve of GM's 29 assembly operations were struck -enough to cause rapid backups of supplies and stop production of many of GM's most popular cars. 
The 13th plant affected was GM's research center outside Detroit. 
Only one of them was scheduled for weekend work, through some workers at two Ohio and New York plants which were not struck stayed away, forcing some shift cancella­tions.

Controversy sparked by X-rated fundraiser at Indiana University 
Associated Press 
BLOOMINGTON, IND. A showing of the X-rated film, "Deep Throat" sponsered by a men's dor­mitory this past weekend at Indiana University in Bloomington has sparked a controversy at that univer­sity. 
Dodd's House, a men's dormitory, showed the film Friday and Saturday as part of the dormitory's annual fund-raiser for its "Uttle 500" bicycle racing team, intramural sports and parties. 
The screenings came on the same weekend that the Bloomington chapter ofthe National Organization of Women, Bloomington Film Soci­ety and Ill office for Women's Affairs showed the anti-porn film, "Not a Love Story." The groups also sponsored other activities to high­light their views about pornography. 
Monroe County Prosecutor Ron Waicukauski says he probably won't take legal action against the group that sponsored the film. 
At a panel discussion Saturday night following the showing of"Not a Love Story," Waicukauski said he has the option of filing criminal charges against the Dodds House students for exhibiting obscene ma­terial. 
But he said, "My own perception is that that would be a very difficult to do." · 
He said he would have to con­vince a jury that the students who sponsored the showing are criminals.

The national organization protests violence against and the dehumanization ofwomen.

Fishing boat accident tragedy by land, water 
Associated Press 
BEVERLY SHORES, Ind. -A com­mercial fishing boat accident and the crash ofan ambulance rushing to the scene have left a 2-year-old girl dead, one man hospitalized and a fis­herman lost in Lake Michigan, aut­horities said yesterday. 
Divers from the Porter County Sheriff's Department were searching Lake Michigan for 25-year-old William Cornealuson of Michigan City, who was last seen when his 35­foot fishing boat capsized near Beverly Shores at 11 a.m. Saturday, police said. 
Police called offthe search yester­day afternoon, but planned to !"esume it this morning. 
The other man on board the boat, 45-year-old William Dickinson of Michigan City, was rescued minutes after the boat went down at 11 a.m. Saturday. He was being treated at Memorial Hospital in Michigan City for hypothermia and water in his lungs. 
Dickinson said he and Cor­nealuson had just picked up their fis­hing nets and were 1,000 feet from shore when they heard a"hell of a crash" on the windward side of the vessel. He said the lake's 6-foot waves probably propelled a log or other debris into the boat, causing the craft to take on water and trap the two men inside the cabin. 
"We knew we were going to go down," he said, adding that it was only a minute or two from the time he heard the crash until the boat was under water. 
Dickinson said he surfaced, then tried to communicate with Cor­nealuson. 
"I hollered at him to get off his boots and rubber pants, then I saw him duck under. I thought he was taking off his gear or looking for me. I was looking for something to hold on to, and that's the last time I saw him," he said. 
In the meantime, a Porter County Emergency Medical Services am­bulance that was rushing to the scene collided with a car on Indiana 49 in Chesterton, police said. 
Chesterton police said 2-year-old Michelle Pomeroy of Porter was killed in the crash, and her mother, 22-year-old Barbara Pomeroy, was taken to Porter Memorial Hospital with a concussion.

Unidentified warplanes score hits on Persian Gulf oil tankers, 6 hurt 
Associated Press 
MANAMA, Bahrain -Warplanes over the Persian Gulf scored missile hits on two oil tankers yesterday, one a Greek-owned vessel chartered by Texaco and the other a South Korean ship carrying oil for Sri Lanka. Six seamen were reported hurt and extensive damage was re­ported. 
The raiders were not positively identified, but an officer on one ship reportedly saw Iranian markings on the planes. Shipping sources said the attacks were apparently Iran's response to recent sea and air strikes by Iraq against ships going to and from Iranian oil terminals. 
Iran and Iraq also reported new fighting yesterday in their four-year­
old conflict in the 733-mile war 
zone along their border. 
Arab radio stations in the gulf region said the defense and foreign ministers of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council will hold an emergency conference in Saudi Arabia tomorrow to discuss protec­tion for commercial shipping. The six nations are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman. 
The two tankers hit yesterday were the Greek-owned, Liberian­registered Medheron and the South Korean-owned Royal Colombo, which was chartered by Sri Lanka's government-owned Ceylonese Ship­ping Corp. 
The raids drew no immediate comment from either Iraq or Iran. 
Iraq ordinarily issues statements claiming responsibility almost im­mediately after it has attacked a ship. 
In addition, Iraq usually attacks ships near Iran's Kharg Island oil ter­minal, while Iran's retaliatory at­tacks are usually against ships in neutral Arab waters. Both attacks yesterday were in neutral, central gulf waters more than 200 miles south of Kharg. 
The 122,000-ton Medheron, hit starboardside by a missile, was on its way to Ras Taunra, Saudi Arabia, to pick up a shipment of crude oil for Texaco. 
"My chiefofficer sighted the plane which carried the Iranian colors and markings visibly," the captain, Charalamsos Koliatis. 

Israeli Defense Minister Rabin calls Lebanese war most divisive 
Associated Press 
JERUSALEM -Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, in his first speech since taking office, called Israel's war in Lebanon the most divisive in the Jewish nation's 36-year history yesterday and said it must end. 
He gave no time frame for withdrawing Israel's troops, saying only that Israel first must secure its northern border from guerrilla at­tacks. 
"I think this goal can be achieved not in terms of years but in a much shorter period. More than that I would not say now," said Rabin in a 
speech to the U.S.-based United Jewish Appeal. 
At its first meeting yesterday, Prime Minister Shimon Peres' new Cabinet meanwhile agreed to cut $1 billion from the projected national budget of S20 billion. Peres' biparti­san government was sworn in Friday. 
Finance Minister Yitzhak Modai told reporters that a three-man com­mittee, comprising himself, Peres, and Economic Planning Minister Gad Yaacobi, would decide in the next few days where to trim. 
Israel's annual inflation rate is headed toward 400 percent and, at $23 billion, its foreign debt is among the highest per capita in the world. 
In his speech, Rabin appealed to the United States for economic aid both to help Israel meet its defense needs and to mend its faltering eco­nomy. 
Rabin, a former prim.e minister, drew loud applause when he said the new government planned to "put an end to our military involve­ment in Lebanon."

Draft registration and access to education 
Americans have a long tradition of seeking to uphold personal rights and liberties (witness the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, and the transformations of the Sixties, to name just a few) and to end discrimination which inhibits our nation's progress. However, this lofty and admirable goal of justice for all is sometimes destroyed through prohibitive legislation. When this occurs, American citizens and institutions must main­tain their unalienable right ofdissent. 
Bill Krais 
self -transcendency 

During the past summer the United States Supreme Court upheld that college students who have not registered for the draft will not be allotted federal financial aid. Without thinking, someone supporting this decision is likely to say that individuals who do not up­hold federal laws should not be allowed to use federal aid to finance their education. But this issue has far reaching effects and, therefore, to state the Supreme Court's defense so simply would be very wrong indeed. 
It is quite obvious that the current legisla­tion is discriminatory in nature. It is sexually discriminatory: women who maintain similar moral convictions and ideals as dissenting men go unpunished. It is financially dis­criminatory: high-income students who can afford a college education without the need of federal financial assistance may oppose the law and be exonerated as well, while low­income individuals must either defy their con­science or drop out of school. For the low-income male who desires to be educated, this country assumes the role of a nation de­termined to benefit at the expense of this young man's conscience and/or education. This should not be the objective ofa country which so resolutely declares to be seeking peace and justice. 
Moreover, this enactment yields ramifica­tions which are greatly concerned with edu­cation in this country. According to David Fraser, president of Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania and chief opponent of the Su­preme Court ruling, "access to education is very important and it is terrible public policy to link access to education to compliance with some totally unrelated law." Further, he states that ".we should not use the withholding ofeducation as an enforcement of the law." 
Fraser believes that the responsibility ofthe university is to provide an education to any student who is academically qualified. Fraser states that Swarthmore is "committed exclu­sively to meeting the financial needs of stu­dents." This is supported by the fact that his college grants financial assistance to students who, because of their actions with regard to draft registration, do not qualify for federal aid. 
The decision to give financial aid, in Swarthmore's case, is not one ofmoral consid­eration, that is, it is not founded in some sort of fundamental religious belief. But its deci­sion, and others like it (at such schools as Har­vard, Yale, Haverford, and Earlham) is an attempt to oppose what Fraser calls the "Supreme Court's view ofeducation, that ofa quasi-fundamental right." Yet these schools are taking quite a risk by defending what they perceive to be a grave infringement upon civil liberties. According to Fraser, schools which supply alternative forms offinancial assistance may ultimately lose all federal funding. This seems quite ironic. An institution of higher learning, in an attempt to preserve unimpeded access to education, may itself be prohibited from offering such an education. 
It is not right for a country to impose its will upon another country. It is just as wrong for a country to impose its will upon the ideals of its citizens. Students must question the motives of a country which endorses dis­criminatory policies and which grants access to education to only those who submit to its every whim. 
Once again, quoting Fraser, "This policy creates greater and greater inequalities in our society. I worry that we will end up trying to enforce laws by withholding very important support from segments of our population which are most in need."

tions for which there are, possibly, no answers. In vain, one searches for a reason. 
To instinctively point a finger at the theol­ogy department would be senseless. They have enough problems without this one being added to the list. Likewise, it would also be farcical to think of Ed as a revolutionary who was bent on the concept of changing the world. That only happens in spy movies. One must not blame, one must improve. 
It is often all too e~y for an instructor to try to mold the lifestyle ofa student into a pre-fab form. Granted, this is all done in the name of "education," but where does education stop and manipulation begin? Is it not better to al­low students to come to individual decisions after presenting all viable alternatives? Yet, I have often heard fellow students speak ofhow we cater to the preferences ofcertain profes­sors in order to get a better grade. To have to choose between a degree and values is un­thinkable. To promote such a decision is among the most heinous ofcrimes. 
Ed is gone. Those ofus who knew him have undoubtedly been affected by his presence. Others like him have come and gone here, each leaving their own short but special mark. Doubtless still more will continue to do so. Yet, one must not spend too much time con­cerned about these individuals. The real losers are those of us who remain manip­ulated.

Euthanasia is absurd 
Euthanasia should not be a legal choice at the disposal of any individual. Euthanasia is the killing ofhuman beings and it's wrong! All people have a right to life, and this right should be kept sacred. It is one of the funda­mental bases upon which this country was founded: life, liberty, and the pursuit ofhappi­ness. 
Proponents ofeuthanasia might try to argue that ifpeople have a right to life, then they also have a right to death. This is an irrational state­ment. If people have a right to liberty, does that mean that they also have a right to enslavement? Of course not, that is absurd! 
Proponents of euthanasia might then try to argue that people who are suffering or in­capacitated can no longer pursue happiness. This is jumping to conclusions. What is happi­ness? Every person has their own definition of happiness. Many retarded or handicapped people live a happy and full life. They have adjusted to their situation. Perhaps that is the problem in many cases: the victims simply 
DaneGalden 

guest column 
refuse to accept their new condition and ad­just to it or, in many more instances, it is the surviving relatives who refuse to accept and adjust to the victim's "new condition". Per­haps not being aware of the things around oneself is the purest form of serenity that one can experience. 
Another consideration lightly brushed aside by advocates of euthanasia is who should decide if and when a patient's life should be terminated. If the decision is left to the person in question, how can anyone be sure that that person is rational? What if the person is incapable of making his own deci­sion? If the relatives of that person are left to decide, whose best interest would the deci­sion be in? Economic concerns could weigh more heavily than the value of a person's life? And what if the relatives stand to gain an in­heritance of any sort, would this not be a motive for early termination? If the doctor is left to decide, this would totally destroy the trust in a doctor/patient relationship. If the decision is left to a group of doctors voting unanimously, what's to stop the relative from fishing around until they find doctors who agree with their position? 
Proponents of euthanasia might then offer the living will as a solution. First of all, let me state that the name they have given to it is mis­leading, the living will has nothing to do with living, it is permission to kill. The main charac­teristic ofa living will is that it gives imprecise, vague, and judgmental reasons for killing a person. If living wills become universally recognized as legal documents, then a doctor who is unsure of how to interpret the condi­tions set forth in a person's living will does not have much of a choice. If he keeps the patient alive, he risks being sued by the relatives. His only safe alternative becomes killing the pa­tient. 
At this point in the argument, two impor­
 .. 
tant questions come to mind. Aren't proponents of euthanasia forgetting the hypocratic oath that all doctors must take: an oath which states that all doctors must do everything in·their power to alleviate pain (presumably through the use of various drugs) and preserve life? Furthermore, haven't the proponents of euthanasia also for­gotten the possibility of a cure? Wasn't modern medicine developed, not to ter­minate life, but to save it, to prolong it, and to offer hope for the future? Proponents of eut­hanasia must plead guilty to both counts. 
At the opposite end of the spectrum from the living will, we get back to others making the decision for the sick person, involuntary euthanasia. Involuntary euthanasia is first degree murder, plain and simple. The law states that: malice aforethought is the primary condition for first degree murder. Malice to the layman means simply bad intentions; in le­gal terms, however, malice aforethought means knowingly planning to do something. Involuntary euthanasia, therefore, clearly falls under the legal definition offirst degree mur­der. 
Rather than having anyone subjectively deciding the fate ofa patient, many euthanasia advocates would suggest turning the fate of a person's life back into that person's hands by proposing the use of a test. Ifthe test is an IQ test, does that mean that people who are men­tally inferior but physically mobile should be killed? By this logic, many people who are now considered socially functional would be killed also. How can an intelligence standard be established? All people have different skills, who is to decide which are more desirable? 
These conclusions have the repercussions ofa repressive socialist society. "Absurd, " you might say, but at the War Crime Trials of the Nazi Germany officials it was determined that euthan~ia was the beginnings of the holocaust that followed. If a line is drawn and people who are ill and legally allowed to be killed, the line will constantly be moved a little at a time until it won't be very difficult to get rid of anyone you want by creating a few false pretenses. To allow euthanasia is to destroy the ethic of the protection of all human life. 
Euthanasia should not be a legal choice at the disposal of any individual. The abstract propositions and careful!y formed hypotheti­cals of euthanasia advocates are one thing; specific proposals designed to cover everyday situations are something else. Furthermore, any type of legislation would open the door for problems; problems, which euthanasia advocates always seem to overlook and ignore. A living will is judgmental and abstract; establishing a test is unfair. If I'm having a bad day today, can I have another try tomorrow? If I pass the test once will that be enough, or will I have to take another tomor­row, or until the outcome is the way you want it? 
There is no nice, easy, and clean-cut way of 
killing someone as euthanasia advocates 
might have you think. Euthanasia is a cop-out 
on caring for the sick and dying ofour society.

Hometown Fever, Take this simple test. The telltale signs of HTF include: 
Your Midwestern/Southern/New York ac­cent gets thicker when you speak or think about home. It is particularly strong when you make statements such as "l don't have an ac­cent," or "Bet you can't guess where I'm from." 
You are rabid about at least one profes­sional sports team in your city. It doesn't mat­ter that they have never won the World Series/Super Bowl/ Stanley Cup; you love 
them anyway and you often find yourself in 
heated arguments as to why they're having a 
poor season 
You own at least one T-shirt, hat, or poster extolling the virtues of your hometown. It is your favorite T-shirt/hat/poster and the thought ofit being lost, stolen, or destroyed in a dorm fire brings tears to your eyes and a lump to your throat. 
You find yourselfhumming your state song, or a reasonable facsimile thereof, as vacations approach. Even though your friends clap their hands to their ears and run screaming from the room, even though your roommate has moved your bed into the hall for three con­secutive nights, you keep singing. 
The love you feel for your place of residence is directly proportional to the scorn you feel for other geographical locations. Those on the east coast are convinced that the west coast will -;omeday drop into the ocean. They are equally convinced that this would be a blessing for the nation as a whole. Those in the South are contemptuous of the onslaught of snow and ice that Yankees must endure, 

and those in the North say that Southerners 
talk funny. (Y'all do, too, we reply.) 
You are convinced absolutely and with no room for argument that your hometown is the best, no, the only place to live in the United States and possibly the world. People who live in other places are confused and misguided, or else they secretly want to live in your hometown but fear that they would be rejected as undeserving ofsuch paradise. 
Do you display these characteristics? Not sure yet? Let me further illustrate with a few case histories. 
I have a friend from Pittsburgh who insists that the Steelers are God's Chosen People. She has the uncanny ability to spot a fellow Pit­tsburgher at 100 yards, in a dense fog, and without her contact lenses. "I just knew you were from Pittsburgh!" she will exclaim. Col­loquialisms pepper her speech. (I will not of­fer examples because it would require the inclusion of an extensive glossary). She excitedly pointed out a coal elevator to a group in Indianapolis because she was sure we would be fascinated. (We weren't). 
My roommate turned off her hairdryer, turned up the radio and insisted that I listen to a Michigan advertisement because it men­tioned apples from Romeo, her hometown. Long Islanders believe that the United States is merely an annex to the strip of land that they call home. And a friend of mine who lives in Washington,D.C. seems to think that it is not the capital of the United States but of the world. I'm from Atlanta and I can show you the exact spot downtown where Melanie and Ashley Wilkes' house would have stood. Ask me about mint juleps on the verandah. 
The regional debates are ongoing. Is it soda or pop? Tennis shoes or sneakers? The issues are not that important but the fervency with which we plunge into arguments would indi­cate otherwise. But as silly as we all must sound sometimes, it is good to hear someone hotly defending their home. In a world that often seems jaded and cynical, fierce loyalties do exist and surface frequently. So keep· talking up the city of your choice. Keep the home fires burning.

P.O.BoxQ  
Reagan's "patriotism" hides real problems Dear Editor: I am writing in regard to last week's column by Bill Healy and the subsequent letter from Evan Farley. To say that the poor have benefitted most from President Reagan's economic policies is a cruel lie and ill-thought argu ment when one looks at the ever growing numbers of families finding themselves members of that class. Saying that the Reagan administration has tightened the belt of government spend­ing is equally foolish in the face ofthe growing deficit, and the ever increasing military budget. These oversights, though upsetting, are not the main purpose of this letter. Both Healy and Farley seem quite commit­ted to the traditional values and "new" patrio­tism they find so evident in the person of Reagan. I must say that I am not against family, faith, or pride in one's country. I firmly believe in all of these items, its just that I don't see them as readily in the policies of our current administration. Patriotism is a broad word that can be used in many ways. Certainly an unquestioning love for ones country may be patriotic, but for me the word has always meant something more. Since the beginning of my education I've been told how the founding statesmen of this nation formed a government on the beliefthat equality, justice and liberty were self-evident rights which should be granted to all human beings. These beliefs were not fought for in great wars against evil and malicious empires, but against fellow countrymen. In the fields, factories and on the floors of congress, the workers, the poor, and those cut off from these self-evident rights due to color ofskin or difference of tongue have waged battles in an attempt to secure them for all people and make this nation truer to its cause. This to me is the true patriotic spirit, to guide our country, which as a democracy acts in our name, on the right and just path. Certainly pride in our accomplishments as individuals acting in our country's name is all well and good, but to do so and ignore the questionable actions of our government and its allies in foreign lands, to ignore the hungry and homeless while we spend billions on weapons that we hope to never use, to ignore  the growing rift between our nation and the ling: the executioner simply obeying orders Johns of Lewis Hall, owe the entire freshman only other nation with the military power or the society which hands down those or­class an apology for insulting the intelligence great enough to destroy not only us but the ders? of one of the chosen participants in the Uni­whole world as we know it, is not only foolish, The greatest weakness in Cimino's argu­versity's prestigious honors program!

Dedrick said Ellerbe and Ellerbe were chosen repeatedly for both their well-conceived plans and their reasonable cost.

HOPE for eating disorders


by Kathy Scarbeck

C
how down. Pig out. Freshman fifteen. These are terms that are used to describe the eating habits of many young people. 
Bulemia. Anorexia. These too are terms that, although lesser known, characterize the t:ating habits of nearly 20 percent of all college-age women who, as physicians say, are literally starving themselves to death. 
Both bulemia and anorexia ner­vosa are very serious eating disor­ders that affect mainly young 
women. According to former Notre Dame staffpsychologist Dr. Daniel Rybicki, both cases involve "an extreme fear offat." (The word bulemia comes from a Greek word meaning "ox hunger," suggestive ofthe bulemic's vora­cious appetite. Common to many bulemics is the binge/purge cycle which involves the consumption of large quantities of food high in simple sugar content. Between 2,000 and 6,000 calories are in­jesteo during the typical binge which is then followed by wme sort ofcompensatory action. Self induced vomiting, laxatives, diuretics, and amphetamines have all been used in attempts to purge one's self of food. "Laxatives are expecially harmful, because they can deplete the body ofsodium and potassium, causing heart attacks," Rybicki warns. One can easily become hooked on them and develop a "lazy bowl system" which may result in dehydration. Another type of bulemic is the binge restrictor who will binge but then starve herself. Rybicki says, "If you either binge or purge, then you've got a problem." Anorexia nervosa is a form of self starvation in which the person's fear ofbecoming obese results in a drastic loss ofbody weight. While the bulemic recognizes her prob­lem, the anorectic denies that one exists. 

Rybicki implicates society as being a major cause ofbulemia. "Ninety five percent of the patients I treat are female. Many women feel they must meet social expectations and have sul:cessful careers in addi­tion to being good housewives and mothers. They try to l.Je Wonder Woman and are trying to do too much. 
Bulemia also centers on the "high status issues" ofweight and appear­ance. "Sit in the St. Mary's cafeteria for just five minutes, and you'll hear talk about diets and weight," says Rybicki. 
A patient of Rybicki named Char­lotte has struggled vith many of these problems. She is 41, older than the average bulemic, but her troubles began during her teen years. Her weight tended to fluc­tuate, and she tried several different diets; after quitting smoking she gained still more. 
"I used to model, and my appear­ance means a lot to me. I couldn't handle my weight problem and wondered why I couldn't stop eating. It became more frustrating, and the only thing to do was throw up. I kept promising myself that this was the last time and that tomorrow I'd get a hold of it, but tomorrow never came," said Charlotte. 
After seeing a segment on bulemia on the Phil Donahue show, Charlotte "slightly thought" she might be bulemic and wrote down the number of a national agency that helps people with bulemia. 
"About six or seven months later I got worse and began hinging in my car, so I didn't have to worry about people seeing me," she says. "I'd spend two to two and a half hours eating fast food, and then I'd go to a McDonald's and eat some more so that when I'd vomit it would come out easily." Charlotte recalls the time when a piece of food became lodged in her throat 
and she had to throw her stomach 
against the sink to dislodge it. 

"I'd spend $20 to S25 a day on my food, and I found it harder and harder to explain where the money was going. One day I pulled my head out of the toilet and looked in the mirror," she says. It was then she decided she needed help. 
"I'm really feeling good now, and that's half the battle," Charlotte stat<;s. "Before I wanted to be the perfect wife, mother, and business woman, but that was impossible. Everyone makes mistakes." 
The recovery process is not easy, and Charlotte still experiences relapses. "The old ideas are still there. I had quit vomiting for 15 months, and then I felt out ofcon­trol and vomi ted. I have now been abstinent for three months." 
Rybicki urges people with anorectic or bulemic tendencies to seek professional help, as the disor­der won't go away by itself. Na­tional referral agencies, support groups, individual and group therapy, and medical treatment are ways in which aid may be given. The effects-kidney damage, bloat­ing, disturbed gums, heart prob­lems, menstrual disorders, and rashes -are, as Charlotte noted, "horrendous." 
Help is now available for students and others suffering the problem in the South Bend area. Rybicki is the director ofHOPE (Healthy Options for Problem Eaters), a therapeutic program of Memorial Hospital of South Bend. It will incorporate involvement from a variety of health care workers, including physicians, clinical dieticians, oc­cupational and recreational therapists, exercise physiologists, and social workers. It will make use ofgroup therapy, discussions and educational information about self-help techniques. A ten-week counselling session begins this Tuesday. For more information call 284-7308.

his semester, the Center for Social Concerns, in conjunction with Student Government, will again be sponsoring the annual Social Concerns Film Series. Four films dealing with important social issues will be presented during the semester. 
The series opens with a film dealing with the Vietnam War.

ust when I had a touch of the Notre Dame blues, I decided to eave this campus to see how stu­dents were busying themselves at another university. I ecscaped to England (by way ofa South Bend theatre) for roughly 90 minutes to see how Rob Lowe was adjusting as an Oxford freshman. 
"Oxford Blues," Hollywood's answer to picking up the dog days ofAugust at the box office, is enjoy­ing a healthy run. What it lacks in substance, it's sure to make up in dollars and cents. "Blues" is the story ofa Las Vegas Hotel parking attendant, Rob Lowe, who schemes his way into getting accepted at Oxford University. Once at Oxford,

Especially topical in an election year is "The Candidate," directed by Michael Ritchie. Robert Redford stars as an idealistic, liberal lawyer who runs for the U.S. Senate and discovers the moral bancruptcy in the behind-the-scenes world of American politics. The film's central thesis -that political candidates are sold the same way soap products and breakfast cereals arc -is as relevant today as it was back in 1969 when the film was released. 
"Union Maids," the third film in the series, is a documentary about women factory workers ofthe

his main priority is to win the heart ofLady Victoria (Amanda Pays), a student of 'royalty.' Standing in the way is Ally Sheedy, a spunky girl from New jersey who takes a liking to Lowe. 
After making a few blunders, Lowe finds himself thrown out, or "sent down" from Oxford. The only way that he can be readmitted to the University is by consenting to partake in a crew race against Har­vard University. Lowe is the team's hope ofbreaking a winning streak that Harvard has had for twenty five years. While it is not fiting that I reveal the ending ofthe film, the outcome of the race seems all too obvious for veteran moviegoers.

field. 
"In the King of Prussia," the final film in the series, is a powerful examination of the motivation of eight Catholic peace activists on trial for the destruction of nuclear weapons. It is the story of how the "Plowshare Eight" break the law of the land for what they truly believe is right. 
The series is organized by the Social Concerns Film Task Force, a group ofstudents who volunteer time to promote discussion ofvital issues of the day and believe film is a powerful means to this end 
"Coming Home" will be shown tonight and tomorrow night at 7 and 9:30 in the Engineering Auditorium. "The Candidate" will be shown on Oct. 8 and 9 at 7 and 9:30p.m. in the Engineering Auditorium. There will be a S 1 admission charge for these two films. "Union Maids" will be shown on Nov. 12 and 13 at 7 and 8:30

p.m. 
in the Engineering Auditorium. Admission will be free for these last two films. 


Daniel Moran is a senior Film Major and a member ofthe Social Concerns Film Task Force. 
What "Oxford Blues" suffers from is a lack ofcreative formula. The big competition at the end ofthe film is all too familiar. Lowe's linking up with Sheedy and his shunning of Lady Victoria can be predicted less than halfway through the film. Everything works out perfectly, too perfectly. Essentially there's noth­ing wrong with "the same old story", if handled well, it can come across as new. Unfortunately, "Oxford" doesn't. 
The film's pacing is severely flawed. It rushes from one sequence to another, solving one problem and creating the next. What the film needs to do is slow down and con­centrate on expanding the potential that it has. The characters in "Blues" are too flat. We rarely see them interacting for long periods of time. The story ends with relation­ships not as developed as they should have been. Various themes such as love and selflessness, Ox· ford tradition, and the contrasts · between English and American cultures receive attention, but are never given foundation. 
One of the film's better scenes deals with a debate taking place in one of the great halls ofOxford. Students are arguing as to whether or not Columbus should have ever left to discover America. The dialogue in this scene is witty as American and British cultures clash over topics such as American art and the significance of "McDonald's" restaurants. This is one instance in which the film is not rushed and is well thought out. 
In the end, "Oxford" falls short and comes out shallow. It relies too heavily on the minimum to get by and, in effect, sacrifices substance. It appears that Hollywood was hoping to sell the film on Rob Lowe's name. Indeed, his name has sold a lot oftickets, but if you're looking for much more than a pretty face in "Oxford Blues," I recommend you look elsewhere. 

Sedelmaier beefs it up 
CHICAGO -He's the king ofcomedy -the 30-second variety. 
He doesn't tell jokes or appear in nightclubs and most people 
don't even know his name. But every day, millions of Americans 
meet the characters he creates, eat the food he sells and even mimic 
the words he uses. 
He is joeSedelmaier, director of television commercials. His cam­paigns -for Federal Express featuring a motor-mouthed executive and for Wendy's featuring the "Where's the beef?" line-have made his name magic in the big-bucks world of television advertising. 
"He's the king of comedy," says Steve Pickford, account super­visor for Ketchum Advertising in San Francisco. "He's in high demand." 
Today, advertising agencies are pounding at his door. A Wendy's sequel is on the air. Movie deals are in the works. Directors are im­itating his style. 
After 16 years of heading his own studio, Sedelmaier, 51, has become one ofthe busiest -and more controversial -men in his busi ness. 
Sedelmaier is perhaps the only commercial director who exer­
cises such complete control over his work, from early casting to final 
editing. It's a style that earns him staunch admirers and fierce critics. 
But both groups agree that whatever Sedelmaier does works well. And all he does is comedy, frequently in 30-second snippets. Some directors say humor in advertising can get in the way of selling the product, but Sedelmaier disagrees. "It's like someone who's ugly and says beauty isn't everything," he says. "Ifyou can't do it, you say it doesn't work." Sedelmaier says he uses comedy because "for most of the things said in commercials, there's no need to be that serious." 
Sedelmaierdoes 60 to 70 commercials annually -each can cost as much as $80,000 to S 120,000. He's already won more than 60 Clios, advertising's Oscars. 
His clients have included Mr. Coffee,Jartran rental trucks, PentaX cameras, Dunkin Donuts, Aamco Auto Transmissions, General Electric batteries, Alaska Airlines, SouthernAirw-ays, the Illinois State Lottery, Wendy's and Federal Express. 
Though the clients vary, Sedelmaier's comic touch does not. In each commercial, there's a bit of Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin or Harold Uoyd, all Sedelmaier childhood favorites. 
And there is one theme: everyday people confront -and survive ­everyday life with dread and determination. 
"I like people who try to make the best of a bad situation," Sedel­maier says. "We all try to do that ... Once you lose your sense of · humor, you become funny." 
In his Mr. Coffee spot, disgusted coffee drinkers toss their coffee pots out their windows while a bespectacled mailman warily looks toward the heavens and then calmly lifts his umbrella to ward offthe metallic rainfall. 
In an Aamco spot, appliances blow up in a poof of smoke just as their warranties expire. 
The world may collapse but Sedelmaier's people don't. "My people never overreact," says Sedelmaier, a youthful-looking man with a white beard, shock of thick white hair, an even smile and bellowing laugh. 
Unlike many directors, Sedelmaier shuns glamour and glitter. He prefers the kind of people seen on the morning bus, rather than billboards. 
They speak in cliches, have dour expressions, wear fedoras with bandanas and keep pinkflamingos on their lawns. 
Sedelmaier maintains a file of Polaroid photos that he builds on as a casting source. Most of his people are not trained actors and he doesn't like to cast in Hollywood. 
Sedelmaier also doesn't work with celebrities, though some have since achieved that status, such as Wendy's Clara Peller, the former manicurist he discovered several years ago. 
"There are an awful lot of plastic people," says Howard Rieger, a friend and senior vice president creative group head at the NW ayer agency in New York. "I think joe has done wonders in casting for unusual people." 
Others are less dazzled. "I think he focuses on the negative side of people," says Curvin O'Rielly, senior vice president and executive creative director at Ogilvy & mather in Chicago. "It's not a very flattering view of mankind. Ifa psychiatrist viewed Joe Sedelmaier's work, he'd say here's someone who doesn't like people." 
O'Rielly also is critical of Sedelmaier's hands-on approach, which can include rewriting dialogue after casting, changes in the se­quence or the emphasis. 
Making commercials "should be a collaborative effort," O'Rielly says. 
Sedelmaier was raised in Orrville, Ohio, then came to Chicago where he attended the School ofthe Art Institute. He took courses in painting and fine art, and worked as an art director, including a stint at J. Walter Thompson. He then set up his own studio, which has seven employees. 
At least one ofSedelmaier clients is singing his praises. Wendy's ­whose ad agency is Dancer Fitzgerald Sample -credits its "Where's the beef' campaign as a prime reason for a 32 percent increase in sales during the first half of the year. 
"The 'Where's the beef commercial has done more for an aware­ness ofWendy's than anything else in 15 years," says Denny Lynch, a Wendy's spokesman. "Joe Sedelmaier brought it all to life."

Irish baseball team wins two, loses , ties one over weekend 
ByTOMYOON 
Sports Writer 
This weekend, the Notre Dame baseball team won two games, lost 
one game, and had  one called  on  
darkness.  
Yesterday,  the  Irish  split  a  

doubleheader with Bradley Univer· sity, losing the first, 4-3, but coming back in the second to win, 3-2. 
On Saturday, the Irish beat Spring Arbor College in the first, 7-6, and tied the second game, 3·3. 
"The team played very well in the four games," caoch Larry Gallo said, "and we had a chance ro win them all. I was very pleased with the hit­ting and the pitching, but our defense was erratic at times. They were making the great plays, but were missing the routine ones." 
In yesterday's game against Brad­ley University, the Braves started the scoring in the second inning when their batter was hit by a pitch from pitcher Joe Dobosh. He then reached second on an error and scored when Troy Guidotti, their right fielder, poked a single up the middle. then in the third inning, Bradley scored another run when the lead-off hitter, Dave Panizzi, hit a single to left, stole second, reached third on an error, and scored on a sacrifice fly by Edmund Waylock. 
Notre Dame scored its run in the bottom of the fifth when Mike Dur­ning reached first on an error, ad­vanced to third on a single by Rich Vanthournout and scored when John Loughran hit into an out. 
Bradley then scored two runs in the top ofthe sixth whenits first bat· ter hit a double and reached third on a single. Two players scored when Eric Kuhlman ripped a triple to right field. 
Notre Dame then scored in the bottom of the sixth when Mike Trudeau singled, advanced to second on David Clark's single, and finally scored on Durning's single, which made the score 2-4. 
That was it for the Irish until the bottom of the eighth when Jack Moran, the Irish team captain, slapped a single to centerand scored on Durning's sacrifice to left field. 
That was how game one ended, with joe Dobosh taking the loss for the Irish, and Lindsey Rolston get­ting the win with relief help from Bob Bretwish. 
Game two saw Bradley again jump out wan early lead when Glenn Dal­lman hit a solo home run to right­center field. Notre Dame then scored two runs in the bottom ofthe ftfth when Mike Carmola was hit by a pitch and scored when Vanthour­nout ripped a triple to right. He then scored on Darryl Kaelin's single to center, thus making the score 2-1. 
Bradley scored a run in the top of the sixth, making the score 2-2. Then in the bottom of the ninth, after pinch hitter john Loughran hit a single to left, advanced to second on a walk to Mike Durning, and reached third on Ken Soos's sacrifice bunt,Jack Moran stepped up and hit a fly ball to center that was deep 
enough  to  score  the winning  run  
from  third,  pinch  runner  Pat  
O'Brien.  
Buster  Lopes got  the  win  and  

Roger Smithburg suffered the loss. In game one on Saturday, Spring Arbor exploded for three runs in the 

first, when the first two batters hit back-to-back singles and the clean­up hitter drew a walk, thus loading the bases. Then Irish pitcher Brad Cross threw a wild pitch, thus allow­ing Spring Arbor to score its first run. The next batter then hit into a fielder's choice, scoring the second run, and the sixth batter reached first on an error, allowing the third run to score. 
Notre Dame's big inning was in the fifth, when, trailing 5·3, David Clark reached first on an error by the shortstop, reached second on a single by Loughran, and both ad­vanced on a single by Mike Wook­cock. With the bases loaded, Tom Guilfoile reached second on an er­ror by the second baseman, thus al­lowing two runs to score for the Irish, making the score 5-5. 
Spring Arbor then scored their last run in the sixth when thier lead­offhitter single to left and scored on a fielder's choice. 
Notre Dame didn't strike back un­til the Irish scored the tying run in the bottom of the eighth when Tom Guilfoile nailed a double to left-
IS Notre Dame 'Still Catholic? 

Mention Notre Dame to most people and what do they think of? Pat O'Brien? The Gipper? The Golden Dome? Everything Catholic and American? Well, a lot of water has flowed down the St. Joseph River since Knute Rockne: All American. 
By the spring semester of 1984 it was clear that the theology de­partment at Notre Dame was in serious trouble. Father Richard McBrien had been brought in three years before to re-Catholicize what was clearly becoming an interdenominational department. In the spring of 1983 a number af students had become so scandalized by their theology teachers that they took their own poll to find out which if any of them still believed that Christ rose from the dead, 
. that Mary was a virgin, or that homosexuality and abortion were wrong. In the fall of 1983, the department hired former priest Daniel 
C. Maguire as the John A. O'Brien Professor of Moral Theology. In his first semester at Notre Dame, Maguire published a proabortion article in Christian Century. Either he or Notre Dame or both were testing the waters to see whether it was now acceptable to be a pro­abortion moral theologian at a Catholic university. 
By the end of 1983-84 academic year, tenured theology pro­fessor Elizabeth Schuessler Fiorenza had lent her name to a manifesto issued by the notorious proabortion front group Catho­lics for Free Choice. Of all the people who signed the manifesto only two were teaching at Catholic institutions, and both of them were at Notre Dame. Both the local bishop and Father Hesburgh were em­barrassed, and both were hoping that the whole thing would go away before anyone noticed. 
But just when things seemed to be quieting down, the article in Fidelity appeared. "Is Notre Dame Still Catholic?", based on in­terviews with students, seminarians, theology professors, and Fa­ther McBrien, the department chairman, shows that the apostasy had gone deeper than anyone suspected. "Is Notre Dame Still Cath­olic?" brings the full story of what has happened at Catholic univer­sities out in the open. It is indispensable reading for anyone who wants to know what went wrong with Catholic education in this country and what we can expect when the pope and bishops act to implement the new code of canon law. 
Reprints of this important article are available for $1.50. Or you can get a copy free with a one year subscription to Fidelity, a new Catholic magazine that is as Catholic as the pope. 
Fidelity tells the stories that you won't read anywhere else. It gives a truly Catholic perspective on the most intimate and critical issues of our time-the battle for the family (of which the abortion issue is just one skirmish) and the battle for the Catholic Church in the United States. 
Send me $15, and I'll send you 12 issues of a magazine that is unapologetically Catholic. It's Catholic enough to make a difference in a person's life.

center field. He then scored when Jack Moran hit into a fielder's choice, thus making the score, 6-6. Notre Dame then won the game in the bottom of the ninth when John Murphy stroked a single to right and advanced to second on Loughran's sacrifice bunt. He then scored when Mike Woodrock hit a single to right, ending the game, 7-6. 
The winning pitcher for the Irish was Kevin Rudge, who relievedJohn Gleeson in the ninth, who earlier had relieved Brad Cross, the starting pitcher. Spunger suffered the loss for Spring Arbor. 
Notre Dame is now 2-1-1 in the fall season. 
Victory 
continued/rom page 16 
Ohio State in ninth. 
In a cross country meet only the 
top five runners from each team 
count in the final score. However, 
the sixth-and seventh-place runners 
keep their place in the standings and 
do not allow the scoring runners 
from another team to move up in the 
scoring placements. 
John Magill was the sixth-place 
runner for Notre Dame, and he 
finished twenty-third overall in a 
time of 25:22.7. Rick Mulvey placed 
seventh for the Irish and twenty­
eigth overall in a time of 25:40.3. 
The forty-nine-man field got off to 
a clean start, and at the one-mile 
mark a Western Michigan runner 
was in front with a quick 4:48 first 
mile. The rest of the field was still 
tightly bunched together and di­
rectly behind the lead runner. 
One mile later Ohio State runners 
claimed the top two spots as they 
sped by the two mile mark in 9:42. 
The rest of the pack was close be­
hind and running three and four 
abreast. Only a few runners had 
begun to fall off the pace. 
The next mile made a difference in spreading out the field because after three miles all the runners were running single file. Leading the field was Klodnick of Ohio State, Mau of Northwestern, and followed by the three Notre Dame runners: Collins, Cannon, and Courtney. The lead time at this point in the race was 14:42. 
At the four-mile mark Mau claimed the lead spot for good, while Klodnick trailed by twenty yards. Ten yards further back was the group of three Notre Dame run­ners. Mau cruised over the first four miles in 19:32. 
No surprises were in store at the finish because Mau ran strong all the way. Klodnick wasn't able to chal­lenge for the lead at the end, but he ran well enough to fend off any threat by the group ofIrish runners. The three Notre Dame runners ran together down the stretch until the end when Collins nosed ahead of Cannon and Courtney. 
After the meet Piilne was "real pleased." He said the "top seven ran very well" while the rest ofthe team did a great job, and he had no com­plaints. He said he was surprised by his team's wide margin ofvictory. 
The Irish runners have a much deserved week offto rest. They must begin to prepare for the National Catholic Meet, which will be held at Notre Dame on Friday, September 28.

The Notre Dame soccer team remained undefeated this weekend with a win over Northwestern yes­terday and a tie with Michigan State on Friday. 
Yesterday afternoon at Northwes­tern, Notre Dame had to overcome not only the Northwestern team but also some very poor officiating for the win. The Irish were penalized 35 times, while the Wildcats were whistled only nine. One Irish player was ejected from the game with a red card because the official thought he said something which, in fact, a 
spectator  had  shouted  from  the  
stands.  
Despite the  disadvantageous  of­ 

ficiating, the Irish soundly defeated their opponents, 3-0. 
Junior Chris Telk put Notre Dame on the board with 25:40 gone in the first period. The ball was bouncing around in front ofthe Northwestern goal when Telk rammed it home for the score. 
In the second half, the Irish really began to dominate play, and sopho­more Pat Szanto put his team up by two goals. Freshman Steve Lowney started the scoring play with a cross into the Northwestern penalty area. The pass was deflected by Tom Daley, and Szanto finished it off at 
56:48 ofthe contest.

Irish cross country team easily wi.ns five-team meet

Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame cross country team surprised many people, includ­ing Irish head coach Joe Piane, by easily winning the five-team meet held at Notre Dame last Friday. The meet included teams from Northwestern, Ohio State, Missouri, and Western Michigan. 
Notre Dame won with a score of 30 points (lowest score wins), while Ohio State was far behind in second place with 63 points. Northwestern edged Western Michigan by a point, 75-76, for third place honors, while Missouri trailed with 87 points. 
The lead runner over the five mile course was Bob Mau of Northwes­tern in a fast time of 24:30.3. Kurt Kl.odnick of Ohio State ran to a second place finish with a time of 24:38.3. 
The key to the overwhelming Notre Dame victory was in having the third, fourth, and fifth place run­ners. The group ofMike Collins, Tim Cannon, and Bill Courtney ran in a pack the last halfofthe race until the finish, when <;:ollins edged in front for third place with a time of 
24:42.9. Cannon followed right be­hind for a fourth place time of 24:43.4, and Courtney finished fifth in 24:43.9. 
The other two Irish runners to count in the scoring for the meet were freshman Dan Garrett, who finished eighth in a time of 24:50.4 and senior Ed Willenbrink, who placed tenth in 25:04.1 
Rounding out the top ten finishers was Tim Phillips of Northwestern, who placed sixth, followed by Pigg of Missouri in seventh, and Welter of
