Economic crisis impacts student job search 
Seniors must look harder for full-time employment; some turn to volunteering 
By ROBERT SINGER Assistam News Ediror 
About 24 percent of Notre Dame graduates will still be seeking employment following the cere­mony in May -doubling the 12 percent of the class of 2008 who were in limbo after graduation ­according to an estimate made by Career Center Director Lee Svete. 
When the economy is growing, a typical Notre Dame senior could expect a job offer after interview­ing with six to eight companies, but in the current downturn, that number might be 15 to 20, Svete said. However, this number will probably become more favorable as graduation approaches, as other job candidates give up and companies can more easily identi­fy their needs with a closer start date. 
Svete mentioned two reasons for why companies are cutting back. 
"They've lost revenue and as a result their budget has been decreased," Svete said. "There's been very little attrition at compa­nies. Senior employees are decid­ing to stick around at their jobs, causing a chain reaction." 
After the financial crisis devas­tated retirement accounts, many

Underclassmen look for alternatives to scarce summer jobs, internships 
By SARAH MERVOSH 
News Writer 
Sophomore Caroyln Conley will be spending her summer participating in a paid internship at PNC Bank in Pittsburgh, but said she was "lucky" to receive this posi­tion. 
"A lot of really talented people really don't have internships for the summer because a lot of companies have scaled back," Conley said. "I definitely think that I was very lucky to get an internship at all let alone a paid one." 
Many underclassmen stu­dents have had to adjust expectations and alter plans for the upcoming summer because of the current econ­omy troubles. 
Companies have drastical­ly reduced the number of intern positions they offer due to cost cuts within the company, Lee Svete, director of Notre Dame's Career Center, said. Companies that usually take five or six interns can only take one this year, he said.

iPhone use increasing on campus 

OIT director Latimer attributes sudden rise this semester to Christmas presents 
iPhone use on campus 

By SARAH MERVOSH 
News Writer 
iPhone usage on campus has increased fourfold this year, according to the University's Chief Technology Officer, DeWitt Latimer. 
This increase is part of a cam­pus-wide move towards mobility, which includes Blackberries and other "smart phones," Latimer said. 
"There has been a large explo­sion of smart phones on cam­pus," Latimer said. "There is a clear move towards mobility. The iPhone has kind of become the poster child for this." 
Economy ilnpacts developing world 
Aid lessens as developed world tries to maintain its standard of living 
By MOLLY MADDEN News Writer 
Professors Jeffrey Bergstrand, Father Robert Dowd, C.S.C., and Amitava Dutt discussed the impact of the global economic cri­sis on developing nations in "The Cost of Crisis: The Outlook for International Development," the final installment of a lecture series sponsored by the Ford Program. 
The talk centered on the issue of what the global north can do to help with the problems of the global south that have arisen due to the crisis. 
"Development itself, even when things are good, is very difficult," Bergstrand, a professor of fmance, said. "The big picture is

Latimer estimated that as of the beginning of the 2007-08 academic year, the number of iPhones on campus was in the single digits. At the beginning of the 2008-09 academic year, there were 210 iPhones on cam­pus. Currently, there are 838 iPhones on campus. 
"I do think a lot of them were probably Christmas presents," he said. 
Latimer said the increase of iPhone usage is not going to affect student reception because the Office of Information Technology (OlD is prepared for the increase.

CAMPUS LIFE COUNCIL 

Online calendar resolution passed 
By LAURA McCRYSTAL 
News Writer 
Campus Life Council (CLC) unanimously passed a resolu­tion to promote a reevaluation of the online University events calendar at its meeting Wednesday. 
Student body president Grant Schmidt, who reported for the task force on technology and study space in dorms, said the resolution has three parts. 
"We request a reevaluation of the current agenda.nd.edu," he said. 
Schmidt said the task force 

would like to eventually see Google calendar or other Google applications and newer technology integrated into the calendar to make it more accessible for students. 
The resolution also asks Fr. Mark Poorman, vice president for student affairs, to discuss the calendar situation with the Office of Information and Technology (OIT) Chief Information Officer Gordon Wishon. The final part of the resolution asks that the online calendar become a main con­cern, Schmidt said.

How to fix Blue-Gold 
What do you expect to see on Saturday at the Blue-Gold Game: a scrimmage or a football game? Saturday marks the 80th annual Blue-Gold Game at Notre Dame Stadium. For the second year in a row, the game will be decided 
Alex West 
by a quirky point system rather than a Sports Wzre traditional scor­Editor ing method. Everybody knows that a touchdown is six points, seven with the extra point, and a field goal is three, but what about how many points a team receives for a making a first down? Recording a sack? Stopping for the other team for a 3 and out? And don't even get me start­ed on the points for an "explosive play." 
Just two springs ago, the Blue­Gold Game was a competitive foot­ball game between a smorgasbord of players, usually a bunch of guys nobody had heard of. Don't believe me? Just ask 2007 Blue­Gold Game MVP, Junior Jabbie. 
Two springs ago, the big ques­tion was: who's the quarterback? Evan Sharpley, Zach Frazer, Demetrius Jones, and highly recruited, freshmen phenom Jimmy Clausen were all vying for the starting role of quarterback in a post Brady Quinn era. We all know how that story turned out. 
But what can we expect to see Saturday? Everyone that attends the Blue-Gold Game will be watch­ing the first team offense play the first team defense on every single drive. Sure, popular back-ups like Dayne Crist and Jonas Gray will find some time on the field on Saturday, but it will be the starters playing the majority of the game. Where's the fun in that? 
Now, don't get me wrong, after the way the last five regular sea­son games ended last season, it's clear our starters need as much time together as they can get. But, at the spring game, I want to see the former "blue chip" prospects and the guys buried on the depth chart getting some play­ing time instead of the same old faces. 
Defenders of Charlie Weis' math­ematical system will say that last year's game was competitive. Jimmy Clausen ended up throwing a touchdown pass in the waning seconds to Duval Kamara to win the game for the offense. But how can there be a competitive fire for the players to go out and play a game with such different rules for one afternoon? 
Tens of thousands of Notre Dame faithful will flock to the stadium on Saturday with many questions in mind. Was the Hawaii Bowl dominance a fluke? Will the new faces on the coaching staff make that much of a difference? Can receiver John Goodman really throw the ball 85 yards? But the question everybody should be ask­ing is: how many points was that last "explosive play" worth?

Man punched in face after removing Cowboys flag 
WASHINGTON -Police said a man was punched in the face after grabbing a Dallas Cowboys flag from a car in downtown Washington. D.C. police Lt. Eric Hayes said someone snatched the flag from a car as it was stopped in traffic Tuesday evening and appar­ently threw it to the ground. 
Police and witnesses said that by the time the man crossed the street, someone exited the car and struck him in the face before driv­ing away. 
Police said the incident may have been motivated by team loyalty, or the motorist might not have wanted any­one to touch his car. 

Police said a man was taken from the scene to be treated for a bruised fore­head. 
Man begs to be sent to jail, judge refuses. 
HOLLIDAYBURG -A cen­tral Pennsylvania man begged a judge to send him to jail, only to have the judge tell him to borrow money to repay a conven­ience store $214 for gaso­line the man allegedly stole in six separate trips. Jerome Banks, 42, wanted Blair County Judge Hiram 
Carpenter to jail him Tuesday. 
Banks said he's due to receive disability payments in about a year, but for now claims he's broke and can't repay the Sheetz store in Tyrone for gas he stole last June and July. 
Carpenter refused to accept Banks guilty plea and send him to jail. The judge told Banks he'd still owe the money after he got out of jail, so he might as well pay it off sooner -at which time Carpenter said he'll dismiss the charges.

Online calendar needs revision 
"We'd like to encourage OIT 
By SARAH MERVOSH 
News Writer 
Student Senate passed a res­olution to reevaluate the University's online events cal­endar, currently located at agenda.nd.edu, and discussed specific improvements needed at Wednesday's meeting. 
Campus Technology Chair Walker Anderson said the two primary issues with agenda.nd.edu are its accessi­bility and aesthetics. 
Anderson said the Web site is relatively inaccessible to stu­dents because people have to go through N o t r e Dame's home

Anderson would also like to improve the University calen­dar by making it more central­ized. 
"As of right now there is no one individual responsible for the maintenance of this site," he said. 
Senate also discussed whether the calendar should be solely for campus-wide events that are open to the public, or whether it should also include events only for students. 
Assistant vice president for student affairs Brian Coughlin said agenda.nd.edu currently posts events open to the gener­al public because that was a criteria decided by the

he said. 
"I think your revision is highly needed," Pasquerilla West senator Megan Carey said. 
Carey said she doesn't know how to get to the calendar directly and can only access it because it pops up in conjunc­tion with another Web site she uses. 
Anderson would also like to improve the appearance of the calendar because the current format of agenda.nd.edu is outdated and unappealing. 
"This format is called French vanilla," Anderson said. "It's aesthetically bland." 
"It looks pretty archaic," Carey said. 





J)AY OF SILINCI 
APRIL 17, 2009 

Please understand my reasons for not speaking today. I am participating In the Day of Silence, a national movement protesting the silence faced by lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and their allies in schools. My deliberate silence echoes that silence, which is caused by harassment, prejudice~ and discrimination. I believe that ending the silence is the first step toward fighting these injustices. Think about the voices you are not hearing today.

al public," 
Coughlin said. 
"That's just the 

public nature of the Notre Dame Web site." 
On the new Web site, Anderson said, "I don't see why [most student events] couldn't be promoted pub­licly." 
Anderson also said the improved Web site could be used for admissions. 
"Prospective students will go onto the calendar and see what's happening around cam­pus and say 'Oh, that's cool. Gym Class Heroes is coming to Notre Dame,"' he said. "They can kind of get a taste of stu­dent life and what actually occurs." 
Senate also discussed incor­body," she said. "And a lot of students don't see it that way or don't know that it is even their mission. We don't want it to be so unknown about the process, what happens, why they do what they do." 
Koski said the task force hopes to achieve this goal though residence hall visits by NDSP officers and representa­tives from ORLH. The visits would involve explanations of policies and offer students an opportunity to ask questions. 
The task force also found that the Pillars presentations given to freshmen to promote respon­sible life choices might be more effective if they were given at a different time of year, Koski said. 
"They're great for education ... but they come in that period when freshman are just getting bombarded with information," she said. 
Fr. Pete McCormick, rector of Keough Hall, said Keough held Pillars presentations in the spring and also had NDSP offi­cers visit the dorm to answer questions. He said both events were successful and that the students found them informa­tive. 
The long-term recommenda­tions for the Medical Amnesty Policy include a rector report to ORLH about medical amnesty, Koski said. Such an attachment would allow ORLH to take into account a student's intent to seek medical help for a peer.

porating Coogle into the improvements for the calen­dar. 
"Maybe by each listing have a button that says 'subscribe,' especially if it's a series or 'add to my calendar' if it's a one time thing," Anderson said. 
Anderson said these revi­sions will take place well into next year. 
"It's not gong to be instant change because we have to get these different campus entities to start working with each other," Anderson said. "If we want to do this integrated sys­tem then you also have to basi­cally create new systems so that the different calendars can talk to one another."

and Web Group to make this a priority in their endeavors," he said. 
With a better online calendar, Schmidt said students could more easily search for and find events that they want to attend. Because students have taken advantage of other online fea­tures, Schmidt said students would also use a better calen­dar. 
"Clearly students are using these online features, so I think this would have groups central­ize their information" he said. 
CLC also discussed the Medical Amnesty Policy. Former chief executive assis­tant Karen Koski reviewed the recommendations of the task force on Medical Amnesty Policy review. 
Koski said the task force developed both short-term and long-term recommendations for the Medical Amnesty policy, which concerns students who have been drinking but seek medical attention for an intoxi­cated friend. 
The short-term recommenda­tions include a clarification for students about the role of the Office of Residence Life and Housing (ORLH).

see the economy shrinking they cut down on giving foreign aid," Dutt said. "This and contractions in the economy leads to a reduc­tion in resources which additional­ly leads to a rise in poverty and usually inequality within the coun­try." 
Dowd, a professor of political science, said the global community should be concerned about the deprivation that might arise as a result of feelings of inequality. 
"During times of economic diffi­culties, politicians play on people's fears," Dowd said. "This deepen­ing economic crisis is not good for democracies in the south, espe­cially in countries where democra­cy is new." 
Dowd said these developing countries that have recently adopted democracy are prone to destruction. 
"In most parts of the developing world, democracy is new and fledging and the governments are not very good at responding to a crisis such as this," Dowd said. 'This is going to make authoritari­an regimes look much more favor­able." 
Dowd said he fears that if these countries return to authoritarian rule, development will stall com­pletely. 
"It has been shown that democ­racy is better for development," he said. "Whether or not a complete breakdown of democracy occurs depends on if the citizens blame the government of the day or the entire democratic system as the reason for their troubles." 
Dowd said the most important thing the northern countries can do in alleviating the troubles of the developing nations is to make sure government policies that are being pursued are not turning the coun­try inward. 
"What we need to remember is that policies that are focused on maintaining the standard of living in the developed world do not trump policies focused on basic living in the non-developed world," Dowd said.

that this crisis will have long-term effects on international develop­ment." 
Bergstrand stressed that while a significant part of the origins of the crisis came from Wall Street, the global community at large is suffering the consequences. 
"In situations such as this, the developing world often pays a big price," he said. "As our economy slows down, we slow down and import less. This begins the trans­mission that hurts development abroad." 
Dutt, a professor of economics, agreed that the crisis in the north­ern, or developed, region of the world has the potential to filter down and be destructive to the southern region. 
"Most of the world's poor live in the southern hemisphere," Dutt said. "This crisis has put the poor in a precarious situation." 
Dutt said while the crisis is affecting Americans and other citi­zens of developed nations, it is nothing compared to the impact that it has on the members of developing nations. 
"Here, the state of the economy means that you don't take your fifth vacation," he said. "Things are very different and much more detrimental to the south." 
Dutt said a unique situation had been created by the relationship between the developed nations and developing nations when the economy was not in decline. 
"Before the crisis, rich countries would lend abroad to poorer countries," he said. "When every­thing began to go wrong, instead of lending, these rich countries called back their loans right as the demand for the goods from these poor countries fell; it put these countries in a very strained situa­tion." 
In addition to calling back loans and no longer importing their goods, these rich countries also reduced their level of aid. 
"When the northern countries

older employees decided to post­pone retirement, taking away positions from college graduates -sometimes multiple positions, as their salaries can triple those for entry level positions. 
This trend did not keep senior Zach Mady from securing an engineering position with Lockheed Martin in November 2008. 
"The engineering market is dominated by older generations of people," Mady said "There are a larger number of people retir­ing in the field than ever before." 
But even as the banking, con­sulting, architecture, accounting, real estate and retail sectors are shrinking, other industries are expanding, according to Svete. He attributed some of this expansion to the effects of the stimulus pack­age. 
Svete said the stimulus is already having an impact, espe­cially in "infrastructure." 
"The federal government is hir­ing -civil engineers, social serv­ices, and health care," Svete said. 
Other fields that have shown promise for graduating seniors despite the recession are green energy, computer technology, software development, biotech­nology and engineering firms with defense contracts, Svete said. 
"I interviewed with Lockheed Martin for a summer internship two years ago," Mady said. "They liked my work that summer so they retained me for another summer and again I did a service­able job. So, I actually applied before the summer was over. I had an offer in November and was secure in my job." 
Green energy will be a booming field due to the stimulus, but stu­dents must be "geographically diverse" when it comes to consid­ering their career options, Svete said, referencing a large solar panel manufacturing plant in Arizona. 
The alternative energy industry isn't the only "alternative" career path that has grown this year for seniors. According to Svete, the number of students who complete volunteer service after graduation could grow from an average of 200 for past years to 290 for this year, but postponing a conven­tional career by doing service isn't a career interruption -it's an enhancement. 
"As a result, our graduates are much more versatile than gradu­ates from other schools," Svete said. "Ethics and integrity are among the top-ranked traits that employers look for." 
Other students, such as senior Jimmy Champlin, decided to attend graduate or professional school and look for permanent employment when the economy is hopefully more stable. 
After considering the Alliance for Catholic Education (ACE) pro­gram, Champlin opted for law school, since he thought a political science major would mostly limit him to government jobs. 
"That way I can push back needing a job three years," Champlin said. 
With an abundance of service opportunities and options for graduate school as well as an expected recovery of the econo­my, students should not reconsid­er their desired academic majors to make themselves more attrac­tive job candidates, according to Svete. 
"Economies are cyclical and to make a short-term decision based on vocation rather than passion is the wrong decision," he said.

Colombian drug lord arrested in raid 
BOGOTA -Colombia's most wanted drug lord was cowering like a dog under a palm tree when he was captured Wednesday in a jungle raid involving hundreds of police officers, the defense minister said. 
Daniel Rendon Herrera, alias "Don Mario," was taken in shackles to the capi­tal to await possible extradition to the United States. 
Rendon Herrera allegedly commanded hundreds of armed men in a private militia and directed a criminal organization that sent hundreds of tons of cocaine to the u.s. 
President Alvaro Uribe described Rendon Herrera, 43, as "one of the most feared drug traffickers in the world." 
Rendon Herrera's organization is respon­sible for 3,000 murders in the last 18 months alone, said Gen. Oscar Naranjo, who directs the national police. 
Iran scientists clone female goat 
ISFAHAN, Iran-Iranian scientists have cloned a goat and plan future experiments they hope will lead to a treatment for stroke patients, the leader of the research said Wednesday. 
The female goat, named Hana, was born early Wednesday in the city of Isfahan in central Iran, said Dr. Mohammed Hossein Nasr e Isfahani, head of the Royan Research Institute. 
"With the birth of Hana, Iran is among five countries in the world cloning a baby goat," said Isfahani, an embryologist. 
In 2006 Iran became the first country in the Middle East to announce it had cloned a sheep. Two and a half years later, that animal is healthy, the institute said.

FPA gives stimulus to hazardous sites 
NEW BEDFORD, Mass.-For decades, the New Bedford Harbor was a dumping ground for industrial metals and other contaminants. But now that harbor and 49 other polluted and hazardous waste sites are a step closer to a major cleanup. 
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson on Wednesday sin­gled out 50 sites, in 28 states, that will share $582 million in newly approved federal stimu­lus money to continue cleanup operations. 
"The EPA has an answer for these challeng­ing economic times," Jackson said at the har­bor. "We have moved beyond the false choice between a green economy and a green envi­ronment." 

Sacramento tent city cleaned out 
SACRAMENTO, Calif. -Dozens of the peo­ple who have been living in a homeless encampment near downtown Sacramento folded their tents and packed their shopping carts Wednesday, the deadline set by the city to clear out. 
Many said they did not want to go to shelters or had heard that the city's shelters were full. 
"I don't know where I'm going," said Danny Valadez, 48, who lost his job as a painter and has lived at the so-called "tent city" with his girlfriend for the past 13 months. He said they didn't want to live in shelters because there are too many rules and they feel "a little like jail."

Nationwide 'tea parties' convened 
Protests sparked by anger at government's spending; rallies held in many major cities 
Associated Press 
FRANKFORT, Ky. Whipped up by conservative commentators and blog­gers, tens of thousands of protesters staged "tea par­ties" around the country Wednesday to tap into the collective angst stirred up by a bad economy, govern­ment spending and bailouts. 
The rallies were directed at President Barack Obama's new administra­tion on a symbolic day: the deadline to file income taxes. Protesters even threw what appeared to be a box of tea bags toward the White House, causing a brief lockdown at the com­pound. 
Shouts rang out from Kentucky, which just passed tax increases on cigarettes and alcohol, to Salt Lake City, where many in the crowd booed Republican Gov. Jon Huntsman for accepting about $1.5 billion in stimulus money. 

"Frankly, I'm mad as hell," said businessman Doug Burnett at a rally at the Iowa Capitol, where many of the about 1,000 people wore red shirts declaring "revolution is brewing."

IN BRIEF 
Fiat CEO demands major cost cuts DETROIT -With just 15 days left before the 
U.S. government pulls the plug on Chrysler, the only man who appears able to save the struggling automaker is casting doubt on whether a deal can be worked out. Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne, in an interview published Wednesday, said the Italian automaker will walk away from a nonbinding agreement to take a 20 percent stake in Chrysler and share its small car technology unless the U.S. automaker's unions agree to major cost cuts. 
A Fiat spokesman confirmed Marchionne's statements. 
Chrysler, which is living on $4 billion in loans from the U.S. government, has to take on a part­ner and gain concessions from unions and debtholders by April 30, or the Obama adminis-· tration will stop lending it money. No other suitors have emerged, and it's likely that no bankruptcy financing will be available, so Chrysler would have little choice but to be auctioned off in pieces. 
Program gives money to six companies 
WASHINGTON -The Obama administration on Wednesday named the first six companies partici­pating in a $75 billion program designed to help millions of struggling homeowners avoid foreclo­sure. 
The administration said the companies ­including some of the mortgage industry's biggest players-will receive a maximum of $9.9 billion in incentive payments, which are designed to encourage mortgage companies to lower borrow­ers' monthly bills. The government expects to fin­ish arrangements with other companies in the coming months. 
Chase Home Finance, part of JPMorgan Chase & Co., will receive up to $3.6 billion, the largest amount among the six companies. 
The other recipients are: Wells Fargo & Co., GMAC Mortgage Inc., Citigroup Inc.'s CitiMortgage unit, Select Portfolio Servicing and Saxon Mortgage Services Inc. 
The program, unveiled on March 4, will offer struggling homeowners the chance to obtained modified loans with lower monthly payments. It's being funded by $50 billion out of the govern­ment's $700 billion financial rescue program. The remaining $25 billion will come from other gov­ernment sources. 

Wall Street rally shows economic hope 
Signs of improvement spark purchase ofstocks; some experts remain cautious 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Investors snapped up shares of con­sumer product makers and financial companies Wednesday as they latched onto signs that the reces­sion could be easing its chokehold on the economy. 
Early caution gave way to a rally in the last hour of trading as investors looked for stocks that could bene­fit from a rebound. Technology stocks lagged after Intel Corp.'s tightlipped forecast caused jitters about a corner of the market that had drawn buyers over the past month. 
The Dow Jones industrial average ended with a gain of 109 points. 
Money flowed into stocks like Procter & Gamble Co., which boosted its dividend, and American Express Co., which said it is having to write off less bad debt. 
"The market may not be seeing concrete signs of a recovery, but there are specks of light that we're on the road to stabiliza­tion," said Ryan Larson, senior equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management.

SMC Tostal celebration to host Sara Bareilles 
By ALICIA SMITH News Writer 
Saint Mary~ College will welcome recording artist Sara Bareilles to campus today as part of the annual SMC Tostal celebration. 
Created after an Irish­inspired spring festival, SMC Tostal will celebrate the end of the academic year. SMC Tostal will host several dif­ferent activities to allow stu­dents to relax and take a break. 
The College's Student Activity Board (SAB) is responsible for planning the events held throughout SMC Tostal. 
"SAB plans this event every year, but the activities throughout the day have var­ied from year to year," Michele Peterson, SAB presi­dent, said. "A few years ago we had fireworks and an outdoor movie. Last year, we had popular recording artist Colbie Caillat perform." 
SAB has been planning the event since last semester, according to Peterson. 
"Things really started pick­ing up about two months ago when our offer for Sara Bareilles was accepted," Peterson said. "When this happened, we were really able to start planning the rest of the day." 
This year SMC Tostal has several new events to offer students. From henna tattoos to a photo booth, SMC Tostal has something for everyone to enjoy. The special musical guest this year will be Sara Bareilles featuring Katius, a band from Dayton, Ohio, as the opening act. 
SAB worked with a booking agent from Indianapolis in order to get Bareilles to come to campus. 
"We have a booking agent from Indianapolis who we contacted to find out which artists were available in our price range on April 16," Peterson said. "Once we fig­ured out who we wanted, we sent in an offer, which was fortunately accepted." 
SMC Tostal is held every year to offer students a chance to relax from the stresses of the end of the year. SMC Tostal is free of charge, and allows for some fun to mix up the daily rou­tine. 
"Students should go to the SMC Tostal because the end of the semester is always stressful and this gives stu­dents the opportunity to relax and have a little bit of fun, all for free," Peterson said. "Also, how often do you get to see a popular record­ing artist for free?" 
SAB decided to make the tickets free so all students could enjoy SMC Tostal. 
"We want everyone to go, regardless if they can afford a ticket or not," Peterson said. "They deserve it!" 
The events in the student center will begin at 12 p.m. and will run through 4 p.m. Special desserts will be in the dining hall from 4:30 
p.m. to 7 p.m. The Bareilles concert will begin at 6 p.m. in the Angela Athletic facili­ty.

Vt.lawmakers to ease 'sexting' laws 
Associated Press 
MONTPELIER, Vt. -Parents, school districts and law enforcement have been grap­pling with what to do with teenagers who take sexually explicit photos of themselves with their cell phone cameras and send them to friends. 
Vermont legislators are mov­ing to get rid of one option: child pornography counts that result in lifetime listings on the state's Internet sex offender registry. 
Legislation passed by the Vermont Senate and pending in the House would remove the most serious legal conse­quences for teenagers who engage in "sexting." The bill would carve out an exemption from prosecution for child pornography for 13-to 18­year-olds on either the sending or receiving end of sexting mes­sages, so long as the sender voluntarily transmits an image of himself or herself. 
The bill, however, would not legalize the conduct. Legislators believe prosecutors could still use laws against lewd and lascivious conduct and against disseminating inde­cent materials to a minor. 
State legislatures, including Vermont's, have been cracking down on sexual predators in recent years, but lawmakers here say they don't want increasingly tough penalties applied to those caught up in what many regard as a youth­ful fad. 
"We felt that it's poor behav­ior and it's not something we want to give our OK to," said Sen. Richard Sears, D­Bennington and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. "But at the same time, do we want a kid in jail? 

Do we want them tagged as a sex offender for the rest of their lives? And the answer is no." 
Prosecutors around the coun­try have tried various approaches against teenagers who used cell phones, e-mail or social networking Web sites to transmit naughty pictures of themselves. 
Last month, a 14-year-old New Jersey girl was arrested for posting nude pictures of herself on MySpace. She was charged with child pornogra­phy and distribution of child pornography for allegedly post­ing nearly 30 explicit pictures on the site. But it's likely she'll avoid jail because she's a juve­nile, according to a prosecutor handling the case. 
In Pennsylvania, 17 students involved in distributing photos of nude or scantily clad female classmates accepted a county prosecutor's offer that their cases would be resolved if they participated in a five-week after-school program on sexual harassment and similar topics. Three balked and sued in fed­eral court to stop prosecutors from filing charges. 
In Ohio, a 15-year-old high school girl faced charges for sending racy cell phone photos of herself to classmates. She eventually agreed to a curfew, no cell phone and supervised Internet usage. 
In Vermont, authorities have charged an 18-year-old from Morrisville, Isaac Owusu, with directing two teenage girls to videotape or photograph them­selves performing sex acts on themselves and send the results to him. The defense maintains the girls were willing partici­pants. 
In that case, Chittenden County State's Attorney T.J. Donovan said Owusu's directing the events is what resulted in charges. 
But he agreed with backers of the legislation that volun­teering to take and send racy photos of oneself shouldn't result in criminal charges. 
"I don't think it serves any public interest to paint those kids ... as sex offenders," said Donovan, chief prosecutor in Vermont's most populous coun­ty. 
Ernie Allen, president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said he sympathized with Vermont offi­cials for not wanting to exact heavy penalties for a teenager's foolishness. But he worries that exempting the behavior could have the unintended conse­quence of immunizing genuine sexual predators from prosecu­tion. 
"Our concern is that decrimi­nalizing sexting is a blanket response that is too broad to a problem that is best handled on a case-by-case basis," Allen said. 
Donovan, Allen and others agreed that the real solution is educating teens about the risks ofsexting. 
Allen said his group's "Think Before You Post" campaign was aimed at getting children to think about the practical conse­quences of sending materials that can be reproduced and end up living on the Internet forever. 
Marisa Nightingale, senior advisor with the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, said that many teens who send sexting messages do so as a joke. "But you're basically relinquishing control of how people see you in this very sensitive area, which is your sexuality," she said.

EPAsummitdiscussesbedbugci 
Associated Press 
ARLINGTON, Va.-"Don't let the bedbugs bite." 
Doesn't seem so bad in a cheerful bedtime rhyme, but it's becoming a really big problem now that the nasty critters are invading hospitals, college dorms and even swanky hotels. 
With the most effective pesti­cides banned, the government is trying to figure out how to respond to the biggest bedbug outbreak since World War II. 
Bedbugs live in the crevices and folds of mattresses, sofas and sheets. Then, most often before dawn, they emerge to feed on human blood. 
Faced with rising numbers of complaints to city information lines and increasingly frustrat­ed landlords, hotel chains and housing authorities, the Environmental Protection Agency hosted its first-ever bed­bug summit Tuesday. 
Organized by one of the agency's advisory committees, the two-day conference drew about 300 participants to a hotel in Arlington, just across the Potomac River from Washington. An Internet site notes that the hotel in question has had no reports of bedbugs. 
One of the problems with con­trolling the reddish-brown insects, according to researchers and the pest con­trol industry, is that there are few chemicals on the market approved for use on mattresses and other household items that are effective at controlling bed­bug infestations. 
Unlike roaches and ants, bed­bugs are blood feeders and can't be lured by bait. It's also difficult for pesticides to reach them in every crack and crevice they hide out in. 
"It is a question of reaching them, finding them," said Harold Harlan, an entomologist who has been raising bedbugs for 36 years, feeding them with his own blood. He has the bites to prove it. 
The EPA, out of concern for the environment and the effects on public health, has pulled many of the chemicals that were most effective in eradicat­ing the bugs in the U.S. At the same time, the appleseed-sized critters have developed a pesti­cide resistance because those chemicals are still in use in other countries. 
Increasing international trav­el has also helped them to hitchhike into the U.S. 
"One of our roles would be to learn of new products or safer products.... What we are con­cerned about is that if people take things into their own hands and start using pesticides on their mattresses that aren't really registered for that, that's a problem," said Lois Rossi, director of the registration divi­sion in the EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs. 
The EPA is not alone in trying to deal with the problem. An aide to Rep. G.K. Butterfield, D­N.C., says the congressman plans to reintroduce legislation next week to expand grant pro­grams to help public housing authorities cope with infesta­tions. 
The bill will be called the "Don't Let the Bedbugs Bite Act." 
"It was clear something need­ed to be done," said Saul Hernandez, Butterfield's legisla­tive assistant. 
Bedbugs are not known to transmit any diseases. But their bites can cause infections and allergic reactions in some peo­ple. The insects release an anti­coagulant to get blood flowing, and they also excrete a numb­ing agent so their bites don't often wake their victims. 
Those often hardest hit are the urban poor, who cannot afford to throw out all their belongings or take other drastic measures. Extermination can cost between $400-$900. 
So bedbug problems increase, said Dini Miller, an entomologist and bedbug expert at Virginia Tech, who until 2001 saw bed­bugs only on microscope slides dating from the 1950s. Now she gets calls and e-mails several times a day from people at their wits' end. 
"I can't tell you how many people have spent the night in their bathtubs because they are so freaked out by bedbugs," Miller said. "I get these people over the phone that have lost their marbles." 
Because the registration of new pesticides takes so long, one thing the EPA could do is to approve some pesticides for emergency use, Miller said. 


High school student killed in love triangle 
Associated Press 

CHANDLER, Ariz. -An 18­year-old high school student caught with his 48-year-old math teacher in her bedroom was stabbed to death by her boyfriend, who was himself a former student of hers, police said Tuesday. 
Chandler police said 20-year­old Sixto Balbuena told them he never meant to kill Samuel Valdivia. He allegedly told police "the blade went in like going into butter" and that he just wanted to show Valdivia how much he hurt him by sleeping with Tamara Hofmann. 
Balbuena, a Navy sailor on leave from California, was arrested on a charge of second­degree murder after police found him covered in blood and told them about the killing. He remained jailed in lieu of $100,000 bond on Tuesday and did not yet have a lawyer. 
Balbuena found his girlfriend naked and Valdivia in his boxer shorts in the woman's bedroom around 2:40 a.m. Friday, according to police reports and court documents. 
Balbuena told police that Valdivia apologized to him before Balbuena began kicking, punching and throwing things at him, according to a police probable cause statement. 
Police said Balbuena told them he "wanted to teach the 
victim a lesson," and stabbed him in the lower side with a kitchen knife, according to the court document. Valdivia later died at a hospital. 
He also threw Hofmann to the floor jumped on top of her and demanded to know how long she had been cheating on him, according to the docu­ment. 
Police said Hofmann taught Valdivia math at El Dorado High School in Chandler and was also Balbuena's teacher when he attended Marcos de Niza High School in Tempe. 
A call to both schools was not immediately returned Tuesday. Hofmann's phone number is unlisted. 
Balbuena is the one who called 911. He told officers he felt remorse for stabbing Valdivia after seeing him lying on the floor struggling to breathe, police said. 
Police spokesman Sgt. Joe Favazzo said Hofmann is being investigated for potential mis­conduct relative to her involve­ment with Valdivia. 
A 2006 Chandler police report obtained by The Associated Press on Tuesday shows that police suspected Hofmann of having a sexual relationship with a then-17­year-old Balbuena. 
Both Hofmann and Balbuena denied being in a sexual rela­tionship, and police closed the case. 


A New Commencement 
Notre Dame's invitation to President Ohama to ddiwr the Commencement addres:; and to receive an honorary degree unleashed tl wide controversy and provoked \'iPlently opposed reaction5 nmong all who look upon this University as a sign of the ideal of Catholic higher education. The commtmity finds itself divided nnd confused, and rhe integrity of the University's educational mission .is being challenged. On such an occasion, \Vith g'rt'<lt urgtncy we feel the need to rakt· lwld nf the rcns~;ms for which such an institution exists. 
What is the meaning of Christian education, and even more fundamentally what il; Christhm life today?

How is that connection between faith <tnd life present as the impetus for our work in the university and in snciery! 
For us faith is not an ethka! code nor an ideology but an experience: an cnnmntcr with Christ present here and now in the Christian community. Christian faith gives us a freedom and a passion for living that express themselves abm't' <Oil in tht· form of questions as we fan: reality, and an inexhaustible openness m e\'erything Iutman.

An invitation to a Catlwlic university -an invitation to anyone, especially to the President nf the United States of Amcrka -sl1nuld he an invitation to encounter that history, thar method of rdating to reality, ;md that experience nf life and freedom.

As the year winds down and I pen my last column, there is no better time to look back at the year, and see how our beloved campus has changed and evolved. Naturally, there is no better way to a get a pulse of the cam­pus than from Viewpoints past. So let's take a walk down memo­ry lane. 
The begin­ning of the year was dominated by election cov­erage. There were claims made by all sides in defense or admonishment of all things. At least once Obama was named a socialist, or at the very least, the anti-Christ. Letters poured, lines were crossed and feelings were definitely hurt. But, as is usually the case in Viewpoint, the pain fades quickly. 
Only to be replaced by new contro­versy, that is. In this case, it was the phantom snowballs hurled at our own sacred football team during the season finale against Syracuse. Alumni wrote to the Viewpoint en masse criticizing and dressing down the student body for its alleged poor sportsman ship. I only have to ask how many times those alumni watched their Notre Dame team lose to a 3-8 team at home, in the snow. 
Soon students again expressed out­rage at Raytheon's presence at the career fair, and felt that their third attempt (at least in my three years at Notre Dame) to ban the company would definitely succeed. However, because the economy actually man­aged to explode, job-seeking seniors were probably even less sympathetic than in years past. 
While the Raytheon crew didn't make much progress, the pro-life club did. In fact, I would go so far as to say their January surprise, the multiple-page insert whose appear­ance we were warned of in these very pages, terrified a significant portion of the male population of not only babies, but possibly girls, and certainly future Observer inserts. 


Unfortunately, I shipped out to study for the semester shortly before the new Obama situation blew up, so I've missed a lot of the action. However, I have been trying to follow the ordeal from Facebook, which has proved interesting. After perusing the message boards of the major anti-Obama group, I can only come to conclusion that this "Bill Brasky" man to whom so many wall posts referred must be the real menace. 
Regardless, as I see it, the pro­Obama group currently has a slight edge in membership over the anti­Obama group, so they are winning. What might be more telling, though, is that the group "Boycott Notre Dame Football if Obama Speaks at Commencement" has only six mem­bers; if one can't even manage to give up watching a 7-6 football team, how will they stop the President of the United States? Then again, if the protestors are half as effective as their newspaper inserts, no one will want to set foot on campus. 
Nevertheless, these tiffs are noth­ing compared with the now infa­mous, "I hooked up with six guys" letter from late fall last year. To refresh, our friend Melissa confessed to having made out with no less than six Notre Dame stags in the first semester, and unfortunately had yet to hear back from any of them. Not only was the shock value high, as this was a completely surprising and unexpected letter, but it was also highly entertaining. 
However, some students were quite unsympathetic. They responded with sarcasm and reproach. What started as something of a joke, soon turned into a dialogue on gender and the notoriously sketchy Notre Dame hookup culture. All fun was lost. 
Speaking of gender issues, one subject lacking this year, and one I actually missed, was the quiet disap­pearance of the "Vagina Monologues" from the Viewpoint agenda. What happened to it? Listening to the defense of the vagi­na against those who wished to exploit it was always funny, and somewhat scandalous for our paper; at least before our friend Melissa pushed the boundaries of what is acceptable in The Observer. 
For being a supposedly highly homogenous university, I never cease to be amazed by the diversity of opinion and activism of the student body in dialogue over all issues, big and small, serious and comical. With the election and economic issues at the forefront this year, the level of conversation was raised tenfold, and I sincerely hope it continues to reflect the spirit of the academy into next year and the future. 
As a final sentiment, I personally would like to thank anybody out there who has read any of my columns this year, my editor Kara King, who hopefully will hire me again in the fall and to my friends who have helped me to shape my ideas and edit my columns. I wish good luck to all of the graduating seniors, and will see everybody else in the fall. As they say here in Japan, kampai!

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 

Serving our dual mission 
Dear Editor, 
The tension between being Catholic and being a univer­sity is constant at the University of Notre Dame, as it should be. When either has too great a pull, we fail to live up to our unique mission. Finding a balance is a never-ending, often contentious challenge. 
The current fulcrum on which Notre Dame is trying to balance itself is our invitation to President Obama. The virulent response to his upcoming visit has weighed down the scale on one side, but not the side that cradles Catholicism. 
Through dramatic demonstrations and verbal protests, members of the Notre Dame community are questioning authority. People are disputing the president's position on vital issues. They are speaking out, calling for change. Such is a defining role of universities in our society. 
On the other hand, those vehemently opposed to Mr. Obama's visit, who would have Notre Dame's commence­ment exercises become a circus, are neglecting Notre Dame's duty to its Catholic identity, as exemplified by Blessed Father Basil Moreau, whose Holy Cross priests founded Notre Dame. In the face of adversity, Father Moreau responded with love, always with love. No minds are persuaded by three-ring threats. No hearts are ever changed with angry insults shouted in frustration. If the goal is to uphold the dignity of life, perhaps the stronger strategy is to win hearts and minds with a display of intense confidence in that belief, and a welcome to join. Father Ted Hesburgh expressed this sentiment with his usual eloquence when he suggested that "quite often, the very fact of being here has changed the speaker." Finding balance between being Catholic and being a university may be Notre Dame's greatest challenge. 

That dual mission, however, is what makes us who we are. It is in maintaining that delicate equilibrium that we can say with greatest pride, "We are Notre Dame."

Seventh grade and the Resurrection 
For five years I taught religion to seventh graders during their last class period, five days a week. It wasn't easy. From the stu­dents' perspective, Jesus and I were stand­ing between them and freedom. 
Seventh graders 
question everything. Fr. Lou De!Fra The more sacred, the more they revel Faithpoint 
in questioning it. As a seventh grade teacher, your only choice, other than quit­ting, is to accommodate. 
So, I began to open class with a question and answer session. After a short reading from the Gospels, we came to the dreaded moment. Three students were assigned each day to come up with an insightful question about the Gospel passage. 
They loved this moment. The room was a virtual frenzy as students tried to stump the teacher, and basically blow up the class before it ever had a chance to get off the ground. Domanique inquires where Mary and Joseph stashed all the gold that the wise men gave them. Or, Clara asks, with a smug smile, "Since Jesus didn't have a microphone when he was giving the Sermon on the Mount, how could the peo­pie at the bottom of the mountain hear him?" (So young to be watching Monty Python!) 
But, almost every day, someone asked, in some form, the Big Question: "How do we know any of this stuff really happened any­way?" 
It's an impossibly frustrating question. Yet it occurred with such frequency that it was clearly a burning question for them. How do we know that Jesus is real? 
To ask this question puts us in the place of the first disciples after the Resurrection. Recall, for example, the scene on the first Easter morning. Ten of the 11 remaining disciples are huddled together, in a locked room. 
We can certainly relate. When we fail, when we get scared, when we feel loneli­ness, when we get self-absorbed, we have all turned inward, locking ourselves out from what gives us life. 
And so, also, we can relate to the power­ful appearance of the Risen Lord: Jesus Christ as the One who is able to walk pre­cisely into that locked space; to breathe new life, fresh air, a Holy Spirit into us­like throwing open the windows on that first great day of Spring in a room that has 

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Because so111e people didn't understand the first ti111e 
ND Response wishes to emphasize its position on the presence and participa­tion of outside groups in its planned events from now until Commencement. As our original statement (March 25) says, "It is appropriate that only members of the Notre Dame community lead all events, and we ask outside groups to respect our responsibilities in this regard." 
At no time has ND Response ever invited or endorsed the presence of third­party protesters; they are here as independent parties not affiliated with ND Response in any respect. It is our belief that, in many cases, the methods of these parties are counter-productive and will do more harm than good at Notre Dame. We are motivated by love of our University and have no desire to turn Commencement weekend -or the weeks leading up to it-into a "circus" of any kind. We are not agents of any outside organization. We are ND. As such, we will act as Notre Dame students: in a respectful and mature manner. We will not tolerate any other behavior on our campus. 
Anyone who wants to turn our beloved University into a circus will merely end up looking like a clown. We are a serious organization; clowns have no place here.

Terroristn at ND 
This is in regards to the story 'We Will Make This a Circus,' (April 8). In it, Randall Terry threatens, as the title suggests, to make my graduation a circus. In addition, he hopes this will scare other Catholic universities into not inviting pro-choice speakers to commencement ceremonies in the future. He does so even in the face of a senior class that, for the most part, supports Obama as commencement speaker. 
He is using Notre Dame as just another step in his agenda. These do not seem to be the actions of a reasonable person. A reasonable person debates and is open to all ideas. A reasonable person tries to understand a situation from all angles. So I ask myself, who else uses these tactics? Who else employs fear to force one's beliefs on other people? These, I believe, are the characteristics of a terrorist. 
He cares not what the graduating seniors think or how this could affect them. He is wholly single-minded in his pursuits with little care for the possible effects they could have on other people. He is concerned only with his ideology and how to make other people comply with it. Terrorism can only survive on these ideals, ideals that Terry are bringing to our campus. 
As he now lives here, he might read this, so I implore him: talk about the issue. But do not use protest as a weapon of fear. The United States has a policy of not negotiating with terrorists. This is Notre Dame, and neither do we.

On this Easter morning, this is what hap­pens to Jesus' closest companions-save one. Thomas is no where to be found. Where was he? All we know is that while the others had locked themselves in, Thomas had not. 
The other disciples see Jesus, risen from the dead, and they tell Thomas the story. It's as ifThomas is us, hearing, all these years later, the Gospel account of what the others got to see first-hand. But as he hears, that question wells up in Thomas' soul, the same one that wells up, in its own way, in the souls of my seventh graders, in the souls of each of us from time to time: How can I be sure? Where is this Jesus, risen from the dead, in my life? 
And Thomas even comes up with a test, to stump his teacher. "Ifonly I can touch his wounds, then I will believe." It's become somewhat of an infamous test for Thomas, earning him the nickname, "Doubter." But after five years of teaching seventh grade religion, I suspect that it's not so much that Thomas doubted. But rather, that Thomas possesses a restless spirit-always curi­ous, always questioning, always yearning, searching, testing. Taking nothing-not even the death of his friend -sitting down. Thomas, I suspect, had a rather unquench­able and demanding heart, a yearning for a real relationship with Jesus, one that is intimate and incarnate. 
And so, Jesus appears again in the mid­dle of the locked room: "Put your finger here. Believe in me." 
Perhaps Thomas represents our heart's deepest, as-yet-unfulfilled desire-to be one with our God, to touch him, to know, for certain, that he is alive, that death holds no more power over us, that our destiny is to be one with our beloved forever, in the flesh. 
These desires don't ever get fully satisfied in this life -we live, always perhaps, with shadows of doubt. But happy are we whose yearning and longing drives us always clos­er to being one with our beloved, our Risen Lord.

heyday here in the '90s, using the Notre Dame college scene to channel and reinvent the indiepunk wave that swept the pre-millennium years. 
There were more than 100 bands that formed here, practiced in ofT­campus basements and recorded demo tapes. And they are quickly being catalogued in one place, com­plete with band history, photos, and free downloads: 
South Bend Power 90s (south­bendpower90s.blogspot.com) is a blog dedicated to telling the story of the ND band scene of that late great decade. Started by Theodore Hennessey, '96, they "work to pre­serve, archive, and make available music that was played and recorded by the indiepunk college rock com­munity in South Bend, Ind., during the 1990s." There are currently 39 bands posted, with many more to come. 
Each entry provides a history written by the band members, pho­tos of shows and rehearsals, and quite often a link to free downloads. It is an interesting trip to read up on the antics of bands that were boasting large campus followings

long before our time. There was an entire indie band subculture at Notre Dame in the mid-nineties, with bands inspiring each other and challenging each other to write new, different material. There were even campus CDs released, compilations of work from the many bands play­ing here. 
Most bands of the day seemed intent on recording their original work, and many made demo tapes. Those tapes have now been convert­ed to mp3 files, so it's very easy to hear for yourself exactly what was heard blasting out of Cavanaugh in '94. The entries are blunt, genuine and, in true punk style, often quite irreverent.

Could also have been the cliched searching of a young adult trying to find his way in the world," writes Chad Shaffler of Tacklebox.) If nothing else, they are a witty travel log of how previous students from across the country dealt with finding themselves in the Midwest at a Catholic, conservative university in their late teen years. 
The blog is constantly updated with new posts (each one from a dif­ferent band). Often there are com­ments about what the band mem­bers are doing nowadays, from rais­ing kids to using that engineering degree for writing adult fiction. 
A piece of Notre Dame culture is thoughtfully being preserved, and not just for those who lived it. The blog is almost a calling-card for our generation to take up a guitar and some drum sticks and made music about anything. Bands of yesteryear were flourishing, and the best tech­nology they had to work with was cassette tapes. Imagine what cam­pus bands could do today.

What happened to Notre Dame's music scene? Throughout the 1990s Notre Dame students formed bands left and right, recording demo tapes, playing parties and local bars and clubs. Although Sweep the Leg Johnny and Chisel are the most

dents, more than 20 other student groups emerged from 1989-2000 and created a sub­culture of live music at Our Lady's university that has virtually disap­peared today. 
The student body should be ashamed by this, especially in light of the thriving music scenes of other universities. The four members of 
alternative favorite Vampire Weekend met at Columbia. Two undergrad­uates at Harvard formed the band Chester French (playing tonight at Legends) and signed with Pharell Williams' Star Trak record label as sen­iors. MGMT went to Wesleyan.

NEW YORK -Introduced to a standing ovation, Rachel Robinson stepped to the podium at Citi Field and smiled as she gazed around the regal new rotunda that bears her husband's name. 
Majestic, black and white photos adorn the brick and tile walls Jackie Robinson with his Brooklyn Dodgers teammates, and pioneering general manag­er Branch Rickey. Robinson leaping high in a UCLA track uniform, walking tall in a cap and gown, kneeling with children as they show him their art work. 
High above the ballpark entrance, an inscription of his famous quote: "A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives." At the other end of the room, an 8-foot, blue sculpture ofhis No. 42. 
Grainy highlights of Robinson's life and career run continuously on two large video screens. One of the engravings on the ter­razzo floor: Jack Roosevelt Robinson. 1919-1972. Trailblazer. Humanitarian. American. 
''I'm speechless," Rachel Robinson said. "Jack was actually a very humble man. Some of you who are baseball fans wouldn't believe that because you only saw him on the field arguing with umpires and 
IN BRIEF Senate approves funding

for Indy stadiums 
INDIANAPOLIS -A Statehouse proposal that would allow Indianapolis to raise local taxes to save its cash-strapped stadium agency cleared the Indiana Senate Wednesday as the debate over who should pay for the bailout contin­ued. 
The Senate voted 33-17 Wednesday for a proposal to fund the Indianapolis Capital Improvement Board, which expects to be $47 million short in its operation of the city's profes­sional sports stadiums and conven­tion center. 
The bill would allow increases in Marion County's alcohol, car rental, hotel and ticket taxes with the extra cash going to the board. The bill could face changes as law­makers try to create a solution for the board before the legislative session ends April 29.

Fan fights Yankees "God 
Bless America" ejection 
NEW YORK -A baseball fan who says he was ejected from Yankee Stadium by police after he left his seat to use the bathroom during the playing of "God Bless America" sued the New York Yankees and the city on Wednesday. 
Bradford Campeau-Laurion says in his federal lawsuit his rights were violat­ed at an Aug. 26 game between the Yankees and the Boston Red Sox when he tried to pass a police officer. 
The lawsuit said the officer did not let him take a step before grabbing his right arm and twisting it behind him. It said two officers marched him down several ramps to the stadium's exit, where he was pushed out as one officer told him to leave the country if he didn't like it. 
Campeau-Laurion, a director of Web productions for a media company, does not participate in religious services and objects to being required to do so, the lawsuit said.

The team's new place, $800 million Citi Field, fea­tures the Jackie Robinson Rotunda, a stately entrance behind home plate for fans to file through. 
It was inspired by Ebbets Field, where Mets owner Fred Wilpon went to Brooklyn Dodgers games as a boy. He and Rachel Robinson worked together to help design the rotunda, with its 70-foot archways and 160-foot diameter floor an homage to the 27 -foot­high, 80-foot wide Ebbets entryway. 


Indiana's Williams to 
leave at end of semester 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -Indiana guard Nick Williams has decided to transfer to another school at the end of the semester. 
The 6-foot-4 Williams, from Mobile, Ala., started 29 games as a freshman last season and averaged 
8.9 points and 4.5 rebounds per game. 
Coach Tom Crean said Wednesday that Williams, who opted out of a commitment with Marquette to join the Hoosiers last spring, was dissat­isfied with his role this season and concerned about his future role in the program. 
Williams said in a statement that he intended to look for another school after completing his work this semester. 
Williams would have to sit out next season and then will have three years of Division I eligibility remaining.

NFL 




Jones-Drew agrees to deal with Jags 
Associated Press 

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. Maurice Jones-Drew was one of the most productive running backs in the league the last three years, totaling 6,003 all-purpose yards and scoring 40 touchdowns despite splitting time with Fred Taylor. 
With Taylor now out of the pic­ture, the Jaguars expect even more from Jones-Drew. 
His new deal proves it, too. 

Jones-Drew signed a five-year, $31 million contract Wednesday with Jacksonville that includes $17.5 million guaranteed. 
"It really was a matter of want­ing more Maurice," Jaguars coach Jack Del Rio said. "We want Maurice on the field more often. We believe he's a feature guy and it's his time. We're excit­ed about that.'' 
Jones-Drew replaces Taylor, who parted ways with Jacksonville in February as the franchise's all-time rusher. Taylor, who signed with New England after getting released, ranks 16th in NFL history with 11,271 yards. The Jaguars believe Jones-Drew is capable of filling the void. 
''I'm very confident this is the type of young man that will go out and continue to display the things that have made him so popular to begin with," Del Rio said. "He's gonna get plenty of work. We're excited about getting him the ball more often. 
"We were doing the best that we could as a staff of recognizing the talent and paying the respect to Fred while he was here and couldn't wait to get Maurice in the game. Now, he's our guy." 
Jones-Drew has 2,533 yards rushing and 1 ,408 yards receiv­ing since Jacksonville made him a second-round draft pick in 2006. He has averaged 4.8 yards a carry, 9.5 yards a reception and been at his best in goal-line and short-yardage situations. 
He rarely fumbles, has few dropped passes and has a knack for making big plays and scoring touchdowns. He has become a leader in the locker room and a fan favorite because of his fear­lessness, friendliness and flair for turning negative plays into first downs. 
''I still love the game," Jones­Drew said. ''I'm going to play the way I play. Nothing's going to change. You see some guys get paid and they kind of shut it down. That's not how I was raised, that's not how I ever played the game before. I'm going to continue to play and work hard and do everything I can to help this team win." 
Jones-Drew led the team with 824 yards rushing last year, ranked second with 62 receptions for 565 yards and scored 14 touchdowns. He was one of the few bright spots on a team that was hampered by three key injuries along the offensive line and chemistry issues in the locker room. 
The Jaguars struggled to a 5-11 finish, and players eventually pointed fingers at receiver Jerry Porter and cornerback Drayton Florence. The two signed huge free agent contracts before the season, then did little to merit the money. 
Team owner Wayne Weaver responded by cleaning house. He parted ways with longtime per­sonnel director James "Shack" Harris and several assistant coaches and then released Porter, Florence, Taylor and defensive end Paul Spicer. He also released troubled receiver Matt Jones and chose not to re-sign several free agents, including linebacker Mike 
Peterson,  left  tackle  Khalil'  
Barnes and  receiver  Reggie  
Williams.

NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL 

Thomas introduced as FlU coach 
Associated Press 
MIAMI -Isiah Thomas sat in his new gym for an hour, at one point turning his gaze toward the Florida International play­ers he'll now coach. 
"There'll be a lot of ups," Thomas said, almost in a cau­tionary tone. "There'll be a lot of downs." 
He's experienced plenty of both, of course. Without the ups, FlU wouldn't have wanted Thomas. Without the downs, Thomas wouldn't have needed FlU. 
And so begins a surprising basketball marriage that got under way Wednesday when Thomas was introduced as FlU's new coach, three days shy of the 1-year anniversary of his firing as coach of the New York Knicks. Thomas will not accept a salary in his first season, instead donating that money back to FlU, and will earn somewhere around $275,000 in the final four years or his deal. 
That doesn't count the $12 million or so the Knicks will continue paying him over the next two years. 
"I did not come here for the money," Thomas said. 
Instead, he'll have a chance to rebuild his tarnished Hall of Fame image. 
Thomas wants to move past the problems that marred his tenure with the Knicks, such as being the central figure in a sexual harassment lawsuit and, according to authorities, being found unconscious in his New York-area home last fall after someone at the residence called 911 to report someone over­dosed on sleeping pills. 
He was asked more than once about those events, never 

offering specific details on either. 
Instead, he said few people in the sports and entertainment world stay on the mountaintop for long, even citing Prince and Michael Jackson as examples. 
"When you rise all the way to the top of your profession, no matter who you are, the jour­ney to the top is great," Thomas said. "And then you've got to come down." 
So he came down to FlU and a program that went 13-20 this past season, has lost 20 games in three of its last four years, and made its lone appearance in the NCAA tournament 14 years ago. There's 42 banners swaying in FlU's gymnasium and only two have anything to do with men's basketball. 
"I like taking something from the bottom and trying to build it to the top," Thomas said. "There's a lot of risk in that and there is a lot of reward in that." 
Thomas, a Hall of Fame inductee after a stellar playing career with the Detroit Pistons, coached the Indiana Pacers for three seasons, making the play­offs each time. He had two los­ing seasons in New York, and his career record in the NBA is 187-223. 
"I've had three successful seasons and two losing sea­sons," Thomas said. "So I would say that I'm up." 
Still, he acknowledged disap­pointment with his time in New York. 
The Knicks never won a play­ofT game in his tenure as presi­dent or coach, and some of his personnel moves were disaster­ous. 
"My regret is that I wasn't able to deliver what the people in New York wanted, and they want a championship," Thomas said. "A lot of us have tried .... I couldn't get it done." 
FlU has "no doubt," athletic director Pete Garcia said, that Thomas can get it done now. 
Thomas arrived outside FlU's basketball arena at 10:25 a.m. Wednesday, about an hour before his introductory news conference began, riding pas­senger in a sleek black Mercedes. Even before he could get out of the car, three well­wishers couldn't wait to greet him. 
"Hey! There he is!" shouted one of the men, all of whom got handshakes from Thomas before the car pulled into a parking space. 
"It's a landmark day in our history," Garcia said. 
Nonetheless, Garcia was dogged by questions about Thomas' history, specifically the 2007 case where a jury ordered Knicks owner Madison Square Garden to pay $11.6 million to a former team executive who alleged she was sexually harassed by Thomas, who con­tinually maintained his inno­cence and was never found personally liable. 
"It's safe to say the last two years have definitely taken a toll on my family," Thomas said. "Again, I'm extremely comfortable, and I think the university is comfortable in their findings and what were the facts of the case. It was two years ago. It was a heavy toll and price on my family. But I think all of us are comfortable with the people we are and what we stand for." 
Garcia said FlU investigated Thomas, but would not say what he found or who he spoke with.

NHL 

Crosby leads the Penguins to opening victory 
Lundqvist's 32 saves, Naslund's timely assist help the 7th-seeded Rangers upset the 2nd-seeded Capitals 
Associated Press 
PITTSBURGH Almost seemed as if the Pittsburgh Penguins were playing last sea­son's conference finals against the rival Flyers all over again. 
The Penguins got a goal and an assist each from stars Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin and shut down the frustrated Philadelphia Flyers' fleet of scor­ers for a 4-1 victory Wednesday night in the opening game of the first-round Eastern Conference playoff series. 
Penguins goalie Marc-Andre Fleury, idle for long stretches in the first two periods as his team­mates controlled play at the other end, made 26 saves as the Penguins won their fourth con­secutive conference playoff series opener. 
Eleven months later, the Penguins controlled the Flyers much like they did in winning the conference finals in five games last season, when they scored at least four goals in each victory and finished it off with a 6-0 rout in Game 5. Dating to Game 4 of those finals, the Penguins had scored 12 consecutive playoff goals against the Flyers until Simon Gagne scored late in the third period with Pittsburgh leading 4-0. 
The Flyers didn't like it, either, ending the game with three play­ers in the penalty box as they tried to send a message through some physical play that Game 2 on Friday night won't be so easy. 
This time, the Penguins put the pressure on early, built a multi­ple-goal lead while not letting Philadelphia sustain any offen­sive momentum and leaned on Fleury to make the big saves when the Flyers did make a push. 
They also waited for Flyers mistakes, and there were plenty of them -the first of which was Philadelphia not holding a third­period lead Sunday at home against the Rangers. New York's 4-3 victory meant the Flyers opened the series in Pittsburgh rather than on their home ice, and it made a difference. 
The Penguins also were disci­plined, mostly staying out of the penalty box at the same time the Flyers took several careless penalties, including a hooking call on a tired Arron Asham that led to Crosby's power-play goal at 4:41 of the first period. Asham couldn't get off the ice during a line change, stayed out for an extended shift and drew a pivotal penalty as Crosby scored 15 sec­onds into the power play. 
Crosby threw the puck down low to Evgeni Malkin, whose rebound deflected off Crosby's skate, the goal post and goalie Martin Biron's right skate before settling into the back of the net. The goal was upheld after a video replay confirmed Crosby didn't intentionally kick the puck. 
Tyler Kennedy made it 2-0 at 
1:39 of the second after Braydon Coburn turned the puck over in the neutral zone, allowing Jordan Staal to start an up-ice rush that ended with Kennedy chipping the puck into the top of the net. 
Philadelphia, held without a shot for the first 10 minutes of the second, finally started pres­suring late in the period and was on the power play to start the third because of a Brooks Orpik elbowing penalty. Mike Richards put off a shot off the right post in the opening minute of the third -a goal would have cut it to 2-1

-but Scott Hartnell's tripping penalty shortly after that blunted any momentum the Flyers were building. 
Malkin made it 3-0 at 6:28 after another giveaway. Mike Knuble tried to bank a pass off the back wall, but the puck skit­tered to Malkin and he quickly snapped it past Biron. Defenseman Mark Eaton scored four minutes later to make it 4-0, his first goal in 24 career playoff games. 
Richards hit the post again later in the third, but the puck rebounded to Gagne for the only goal by the Flyers, the first NHL team in 15 years to have six players with 25 or more goals in a season. 
Rangers 4, Capitals 3 
With the score tied in the third period, the New York Rangers did what they do best -kill off a power play. Then Markus Naslund popped out of the penal­ty box and set up the winning goal. 
Naslund fed Brandon Dubinsky, who made a move that left Jeff Schultz sprawled on the ice. Dubinsky then beat goalie Jose Theodore inside the near post with 8:17 remaining, lifting the Rangers to a victory over Alex Ovechkin and the Washington Capitals in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference series. 
Scott Gomez had a goal and two assists, Nik Antropov and Naslund each had a goal and an assist, and Henrik Lundqvist made 32 saves to help the sev­enth-seeded Rangers take the early series momentum against the second-seeded Capitals. 
Tomas Fleischmann, Viktor Kozlov and Alexander Semin scored the goals, and Ovechkin had a pair of assists for the Capitals, who will try to pull even when they host Game 2 on Saturday. Jose Theodore made 17 saves for Washington. 
The Rangers, the NHL's best penalty killers during the regular season, uncharacteristically allowed two power-play goals ­the first time in 30 games they've allowed more than one -but they shut the Capitals down when it mattered. Naslund was

whistled for infractions twice in the game's fmal 12 minutes-the second time for slashing Ovechkin -but Washington's No. 2-ranked power play came up empty both times. 
While much of the focus was on the Capitals' power play vs. the Rangers' penalty kill, it was New York's supposedly anemic man-advantage unit -ranked 29th in the league -that swung the momentum in the second period. 
Antropov and Naslund scored power-play goals on back-to­hack shots to give New York a 3­1 lead. The Capitals rallied to tie when Kozlov netted late in the second and Semin on a power­play early in the third. 
The Capitals will rue the fact that they dominated a first peri­od that ended scoreless. They outshot the Rangers 14-4, and Ovechkin was active with six shots and six hits -including had a few tit-for-tat exchanges with Marc Staal. The league's leading goal-scorer put on a nice move to get around Michal Rozsival, but his point-blank shot was stopped by Lundqvist. 
Among the other highlights: Rangers bad boy Sean Avery, try­ing his best to agitate the Capitals, drew a holding penalty for stuffing his glove in John Erskine's face. Avery and Mike Green had more than their share of confrontations, and Avery shoved his stick into Theodore's chest in the game's final moments. 
Washington got on the board 
6:40 into the second period when Ovechkin steadied a pass from Green with his left skate before wristing a shot that was deflect­ed by Fleischmann to Lundqvist's stick side. 
The red-clad Capitals fans in the sold-out Verizon Center were still celebrating when the Rangers tied the score about a minute later-thanks to a crafty play by Avery. With Gomez carry­ing the puck down the left side of the neutral zone, Avery tripped Green from behind near the blue line -a move just subtle enough to avoid a penalty -leaving Gomez plenty of room to skate in and beat Theodore at the 7:49 mark. 
Antropov put the Rangers ahead 2-1 with a power-play goal at 18:25, double-clutching on a wrist shot inside the far post past screened goalie Theodore. 
Less than a minute later, Sergei Fedorov was whistled for delay of game before clearing the puck over the boards -the second time the Capitals were guilty of that infraction -and the Rangers capitalized when Naslund took a drop pass from Gomez and ripped a slap shot past Theodore, who barely moved and again appeared to be screened. 
The Capitals regained some momentum going into the inter­mission when Backstrom worked the puck down the left-hand side and slid a perfect pass to Kozlov, who was charging toward the crease to convert the easy goal with 49 seconds left in the peri­od. 
The Capitals then tied the score 1 :42 into the final period on a power play after Ovechkin drew a tripping penalty on Dan Girardi. Ovechkin, near the goal line to the left of the Rangers net, put a shot off of Lundqvist's arm. Semin poked the rebound into the net.

MLB 
Mets get first win at Citi 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Oliver Perez rebounded from a rough sea­son debut and the New York Mets earned their first victory at Citi Field, beating the bum­bling San Diego Padres 7-2 on Wednesday night. 
Carlos Delgado homered and Perez pitched six smooth innings to help New York end San Diego's five-game winning streak. The Padres spoiled Monday night's opener at the $800 million ballpark with a 6­5 victory over the mistake­prone Mets. 
After giving up eight runs and five walks in 4 1-3 innings against Cincinnati last week, Perez (1-1) held the Padres to one run and three hits. The often-erratic lefty walked only two and struck out four. 
Bobby Parnell, J.J. Putz and Sean Green finished up as New York celebrated Jackie Robinson Day with a comfort­able win. 
One home run shy of 500, Gary Sheffield got his first start for the Mets, in right field. He went 0-for-2 with a walk and scored a run. 
Making his first start in the outfield since May 16 last year with Detroit, Sheffield handled two fly balls without a problem. The 40-year-old slugger signed with the Mets on April 4, four days after he was released by the Tigers in a surprise move. 
It wasn't all good news on Wednesday for the Mets, how­ever. No. 2 starter Mike Pelfrey has tendinitis in his pitching forearm and could miss his next scheduled start Sunday against Milwaukee. 
San Diego threw the ball all over the place in the seventh inning-except over the plate. Three walks, two wild pitches and an ugly error helped New York score four runs on one hit, a bunt single by Luis Castillo. 

Luke Gregerson opened the inning by throwing 10 straight balls before he was lifted for Edward Mujica. On the next pitch, Castillo dropped a nice bunt toward third that loaded the bases. 
With pinch-hitter Ryan Church facing an 0-2 count, Sheffield scored when Mujica uncorked a high wild pitch. After Church struck out and Jose Reyes was intentionally walked, Daniel Murphy's sacri­fice fly made it 4-1 Mets. 
Castillo scored from third on another wild pitch. Reyes stole second base on the same deliv­ery and raced all the way around the bases when catcher Nick Hundley threw wildly toward the plate for an error in an attempt to get Castillo. 
In the eighth, Delgado hit a leadoff homer against Luis Perdomo into the second deck in right field. It was a harsh welcome for Perdomo, who was facing his first batter in the majors. 
Adrian Gonzalez homered in the ninth for the Padres, his second of the series. 
New York loaded the bases with nobody out in the fourth on singles by Murphy and David Wright, plus a walk to Delgado.

Belles beat Bethel in cross-town matchup 
By KATE GRABAREK Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's (6-7, 1-2 MIAA) beat cross-town rival Bethel Wednesday 7-2, when it came away from the doubles competi­tion with three wins that got it started on the right foot. 
"We have been trying to improve in doubles," coach Dale Campbell said. "We also need to work on finishing our singles matches." 
The Belles received strong contributions from sophomore Betsy Reed in the match, as Reed teamed up with fellow sophomore Jessica Kosinski to defeat senior Jade Jones and sophomore Serena Frey 8-6. 
"My personal goal is to con­tribute to the team in the best way possible," Reed said. "I want to do what is best for the team so we can achieve our goal of winning conference." 
Sophomore lillian Hurley and junior Camille Gebert also teamed up for a win at No. 1 doubles against senior Bree Oles and sophomore Carrie Edison by the same score. 
Sophomores Franca Peluso and Jessica Camp were able to win their No. 3 doubles match 8-5 to earn the sweep for the Belles. 
Hurley defeated Jones in straight sets at No. 1 singles, while Gebert defeated Edison by only dropping three games in her match. 
"Jade has had a great car.eer 
for us," Bethel head coach John Natali said. "Carrie Edison has also come on strong again this season playing No. 2 singles and No. 1 doubles. They have shown great leadership on the court." 
Kosinski won a tough match at No. 3 singles in three sets by a score of 6-4, 5-7, 10-5 over senior Sherra Millender. 
Reed earned her second win of the day at No. 4 singles to round out the victories for the Belles by defeating Frey again while only dropping one game. 
Camp dropped her No. 5 sin­gles match against junior Julia Horn 6-3, 6-0, while fellow sophomore Laura Arnold also dropped her No. 6 singles flight against freshman Brittany Anglin. 
Next up the Belles will be tak­ing on MIAA rival Kalamazoo Saturday. 
"This weekend against Kalamazoo will be a great test for us," Reed said. "We are looking forward to a solid team win." 
The Belles are coming off of two tough losses in the confer­ence to Calvin and Albion. 
Campbell said he hopes the tough loss to Albion will moti­vate the team because they know they are close to pulling out those close matches. 
The Belles will host Kalamazoo on Saturday begin­ning at 1 p.m.

struck first in the top of the first. Second baseman Trevor Stevens reached first on a bunt single and was driven home on third base­man Chris Lashmet's double to put the Wildcats on the score­board. 
Northwestern added another run off freshman lefty Ryan Richter in the third, but Notre Dame was fortunate to escape down only two. Richter began the inning with a walk, consecutive singles, and another walk, giving up one run and loading the bases with no outs. Richter, who was making hls first career start, then settled down, forcing a pop-out and striking out two to escape the inning. 
The Irish never threatened Wildcats' sophomore pitcher Eric Jokisch until the fifth, when junior first baseman Casey Martin and senior shortstop Jeremy Barnes started the frame with singles. Jokisch then induced two ground balls and a fly to deep center 
Jokisch held Notre Dame to just four hits and no runs over five innings pitched. The sophomore was accurate and efficient with his pitches, striking out three and making it through five innings on only 55 pitches. 
"You have to tip your hat to Jokisch," Notre Dame coach Dave Schrage said. "We knew we had a challenge with him on the mound ... he's one of the top pitchers in the Big Ten." 
The Wildcats struck again in the top of the seventh, with the desig­nated hitter Vercelli blasting a pitch from Irish reliever Todd Miller into the bleachers in left field. 
"I started out 0-for-3, and my fourth at-bat I got aggressive," said Vercelli. "I didn't think I hit it good enough, but the left fielder kept trailing, kept trailing, and it went over." 
Notre Dame finally got on the 


Scioscia 
continued from page 24 
junior attack Gina Sciascia added two goals and three assists, and a single goal from freshman midfielder Megan Sullivan finished off the Irish scoring. 
Leading the Commodore offense with six goals and an assist was junior attack Sarah Downing, followed close behind by sophomore attack Katie Denkler with four goals and an assist. Junior midfielder Carter Foote, freshman midfielders Ally Carey and Alex Priddy and senior midfielder Cara Giordano each added two goals for Vanderbilt. 
For the second consecutive game, Notre Dame's biggest issue was getting its offense started. The Commodores started off the game with a 2-1 lead after goals from Downing and Denkler 45 seconds apart with Abt putting one of her own in the net. But after Abt put the Irish on the board, the Commodores went on a four­goal run to lead 6-1. 
Byers put the Irish back in the game after scoring off of an assist from Sciascia before the Commodores netted another four goals. Sciascia closed the half with her first goal of the game, after midfielder Shannon Burke intercepted a Commodore pass and notched an assist, to make the score 10­3. 
The Irish defense stepped up at the start of the second half board in the bottom of the sev­enth, when Barnes launched a homer of his own into the oppo­site-field bullpen in right. It was a bit of deja vu for Barnes, who homered to almost the exact same spot at U.S. Cellular last year when Notre Dame took on Northern lllinois. 
"He's been our leader all season long as far as hitting goes, and likes hitting in this ballpark," Schrage said. 
Vercelli added a couple of insur­ance runs for Northwestern in the top of the ninth, hitting his second homer of the night down the line in left field off Irish reliever Steven Mazur, scoring Lashmet, who had walked. 
"I was looking slider, and it came up slider," said Vercelli. "To hit a home run [in a major league stadium] is a dream come true, and to hit two is a fantasy." 
Northwestern coach Paul Stevens was thrilled with his team's performance, much of which he attributed to their excitement at playing in a major league stadium. 
"I can't even tell you how excit­ed I am," Stevens said. "They were overwhelmed just walking through the front of this place ... tonight all our hard work and per­sistence paid off." 
Barnes and catcher Cameron McConnell led the Irish offense with two hits each. Richter took the loss for the Irish, but struck out a career-high six batters. 
Schrage said he hopes Notre Dame can continue the recent tra­dition of playing at U.S. Cellular. 
"It was outstanding to play here, we did it last year and it was every bit as good this year as far as the ballpark and the crowd," said Schrage. "Hopefully we can keep doing this in the future. It was a great atmosphere." 
The Irish return to action this weekend at home with a three game series against Big East opponent West VIrginia.

as senior goalkeeper Erin Goodman managed to hold off the Vanderbilt offense until the 
21:40 mark when Denkler net­ted her fourth goal of the day, extending the lead to 11-3. From here, the Irish offense went on a four-goal streak from Abt, Sciascia, Sullivan, and Byers over the next four min­utes to cut the Commodore lead to 11-7 in hope of repeating the comeback made last Saturday at Syracuse. 
Vanderbilt had different ideas, however, and scored three of the next four goals. The only Irish player to briefly halt their scoring drive was Abt, with her third goal of the game, in between goals from Giordano, Carey, and Downing. Downing continued to score twice more in the final minutes of the game, as well as goals from Foote and Carey. Byers put up two more and Abt one to finish the game at 18-11. 
Goodman finished with nine saves off of Vanderbilt's shots, while the Commodores' Wills had 17 in her 57:08 minutes of play. Senior goalkeeper Rachel Woolford stepped in to play the final minutes, stopping two shots. 
The Irish will hope to end their two-game losing streak Saturday as they close out their Big East season against Connecticut at home in a noon game at Alumni Field. The Irish seniors, playing in their final home game, will be honored prior to the start of the game.

"The kids that aren't run­ning are resting up after a brutal stretch of meets," Piane said. "We're trying to get as many people qualified as possible, especially since a few people have been really close, [senior] Dan Clark, example. The [Mt. Saint Antonio College Relays] is a great meet, with nearly 8,000 competitors, to get some peo­ple qualified." 
Clark has missed the cut narrowly several times this season. He earned invitations to both the Big East and NCAA championships in his junior year. 
The Mt. SAC Relays kick off this evening at 5:30 p.m. One of the oldest and largest events in the country, the Mt. SAC Relays features thou­sands of athletes competing at the high school, collegiate and professional level in both track and field events. 
Other members of the Irish teams will head to Purdue's Dave Rankin Invitational for competition Friday and Saturday. After the Big East championships next week, the team will head to the Georgia Tech Invitational as a final tune-up before the NCAA Championships at the end of May.

ND offense comes up flat vs. Northwestern at U.S. Cellular Field 
By MICHAEL BRYAN Associate Sports Editor 
CHICAGO -Playing at a big­league stadium didn't help Notre Dame keep the ball inside the park Wednesday, as two home runs from Northwestern's Tony Vercelli led the Wildcats to a 5-1 victory at U.S. Cellular Field. 
The regional rivals played the non-conference tilt at the home of the Chicago White Sox in front of a crowd of 2,101, with proceeds of the game benefiting White Sox Charities, which supports hun­dreds of Chicago-based causes from cancer research to youth education and athletics. 
The Irish (20-13) fell behind early, as Northwestern (9-23) 
see 'CATS/page 20 MVP Award, Brey seemed to indi­cate that Harangody may opt for the draft, at least tor now. 

"We'll talk to you [Thursday] afternoon about how we're going to attack the next two months," Brey said. "Basically, it's a two month project, taking you up to June 15 ... We'll talk in-depth about all of it, but it's going to be a two-month thing." -
Harangody will make hls official announcement in a press confer­ence at 4:15 p.m. today in the Joyce Center. 
He can declare for the draft and still return to Notre Dame for his senior season as long as he does not hire an agent. June 15 is the last day that players who have not hired agents can withdraw from the draft and return to school. 
Harangody won the Big East Player of the Year award hie.; soph­omore season and was a first­team All-Big East selection this season, when he averaged 23.3 points and 11.8 rebounds per game and was named a second­team All-American by the Associated Press.

The Irish are looking to nab a few more NCAA and Big East tournament qualifications this weekend at a pair of pres­tigious events. Notre Dame will compete at the 51st Mt.

We Didn't Go to Jared's advances to Sweet 16 
Cinderella run ends as Old School falls to Delivery Boys 
By CHRIS MASOUD, 
NATHANIEL LEE and ERIC 
PRISTER 
Sports Writers 

We Didn't Go to Jared's made a game out of it by mounting a feeble comeback in the second half, but We're on a Boat (ft. T­Lang) held on to secure the 21­13 sectional victory. Excellent weather conditions and unpar­alleled Rec Sports officiating ensured that both teams would have nothing to complain about at the end of the day. 
"We really did a nice job out there moving the ball," Boaters captain Tim Lang said. "We all played team defense really well together, it was a team effort." 
Jared's came out strong from the opening whistle as Chad Breeden, the undisputed heart of the team, outmanned his opponents in the post for an easy basket. But the Boaters' defense quickly buckled up, preventing Jared's from taking any uncontested shots or easy lay-ins the rest of the way. 
"We had all five of our guys show up, which is a plus, but I don't think it was enough," Jared's guard Andrew Cavanagh said. ''I'm a big fan of Stephon Marbury, so we tried to show them a little bit of Starbury. but unfortunately like the Knicks we didn't win." 
Led by the outstanding perimeter shooting of Mike Manny and the aggressive driv­ing of Mike Lee, the Boaters fast-paced tempo was too much
