Notre Dame associate profes­sor of law Vincent Hougeau 
said the administration of the last rites does not necessarily indicate that the pope's condi­tion is deteriorating to the point where death is inevitable. 
Many Catholics mistakenly believe the last rites are car­ried out just days before one's death, Hougeau said. However, changes in Catholic doctrine have redefined the scope of the sacrament to include not only the dying, but also tho sick ­the sacrament is now morn commonly referred to as the sacrament for the sick and dying. 
"The big thing to remember here is that the Church has changed the sacrament to include the sick and dying, so it is no longer associated with death," Hougeau said. "The last rites means that he is gravely

example in Notre Dame's cultural and ethnic diversity." 
Stone said Notre Dame saw the most important advances in the University's history during Malloy's IS­year presidency. 
"When he took office in 1987, Monk articulated that promoting diversity and international charactnr was one of his top goals," she said. 
Stone said that just one year after taking office, Malloy oversaw a compre­hensive University-wide plan that increased the nurnbnr of both minority faeulty and students. 
From 1986 to 2004, minor­ity students on campus increased from 7. 7 percent to 16.6 percent, according to statistics provided by the Office of Institutional Hesearch. If international students are added to the statistic, the number increased from 8.1 percent to 25.1 percent.

Those who attended Thursday night's roeeption in the llesburgh Library honor­ing outgoing University President Father Edward Malloy's commitment to increasing diversity at Notre Dame got to enjoy more than the fourtoenth-l'loor Ilosburgh Penthouse's spec­tacular view of the sun set­ting over campus. 
Personal and sometimes humorous testaments to Malloy's character made by students, alumni, faculty and trustees were the highlights of the evnnt, which offered attendees tho chance to min­gle and chat one-on-one with an animated Malloy while noshing on hors d'oeuvres. 
"We've gathered to honor a great man and a personal role model of mine," Board of Trustees member Phyllis Stone said. "It's to celebrate both his leadership and his ill but not that his dnath is imminent."

Goodbye, Mitch 

Two weeks ago, I was sitting in LaFortune eating Subway with three of my friends. I looked down at my Sun Chips and immediately smiled. 
My friend, sitting across from me, didn't miss a beat. 
Bobby Griffin 
"But don't bother ringing it up, it's for a duck. There are Associate six ducks outside, Sports Editor and they all want Sun Chips," he said. 
Mitch Hedberg, the comedian who penned the "Ducks eat free at Subway" joke, as well countless others, was in many ways the next great thing in comedy until his untimely death Wednesday morning at 37 years old. 
Instead of writing 500 words about how important a figure he was in con­temporary comedy, I'm going to recount other memories of Mitch ­which, all in all, will do him greater justice anyway. 
The first time I heard Mitch, I was in my friend's car. "Bob, you gotta hear this guy, he's hilarious," he said. 
The CD was "Strategic Grill Locations" and I was hooked when Hedberg started ranting about Koalas. 
"My apartment is infested with Koala bears, it is the cutest infestation ever, way better than cockroaches. When I turn on the light a bunch of Koala bears scatter. I don't want them to, you know. I'm like, 'Hey hold on fellas, let me hold one of you -feed you a leaf."' 
It was that quirky sense of humor, comments that your lazy friend might make when you are sitting around watching TV that made him so hilari­ous. But it was his unprecedented delivery that made him memorable. 
Jokes rolled off Mitch Hedberg's tongue, in a way that cannot really be described without actually hearing him. 
"My friend was walking down the street and he said, 'I hear music.' As if there is any other way of taking it in. I tried to taste it, but it did not work." 
I remember buying both of his CO's shortly after hearing him, the other being "Mitch All Together," and playing them for my brother. 
I believe it was the joke about frozen banana that did it for Dan. 
"My friend asked me ifI wanted a frozen banana. I said, 'No, but I want a regular banana later, so, yeah."' 
I think Mitch Hedberg would be happy with his legacy. He never quite made the leap to the point where he was a household name, but he did impact anyone who ever listened to his album, went to see his show or watched him on television. 
That's not to say he wasn't on his way to bigger things (he had an HBO special in the works, which actually was his dream) but the way he made people smile was more important than any further success he could have accomplished. 
Mitch once said, "So, I sit at the hotel at night and I think of something that's funny. Or, ifthe pen is too far away, I have to convince myself that what I thought of wasn't funny." 
Well, Mitch, what you said was always funny. And your fans will remember that forever.

Fortune cookie numbers provide big lottery win 
DES MOINES, Iowa ­Dozens of people recently got an extra-special dessert with their Chinese food: a winning lottery number. 
A record 110 players won $500,000 and $100,000 prizes in Wednesday's Powerball drawing, most of whom apparently used the numbers included in a for­tune-cookie message. Ordinarily the multistate lot­tery expects only four tickets to win at the Match 5 prize level. 
Several winners in a half­dozen states revealed that they got the winning number

Confused cops swarm woman after birth In van 
KETTERING, Ohio -A woman rushing to a hospital to give birth hit a few stops along the way -first at a gas station where she delivered the baby herself, then when confused police ordered her out of the car at gunpoint. 
Debbie Coleman, whose 3­and 4-year-old daughters were asleep in the back seat, pulled over at a gas station just after midnight Tuesday. 
A customer tried to give police a heads-up about Coleman's situation, but a mix-up involving the license plate number had them thinking the van was stolen. 
With guns drawn, officers ordered her out of the van with her hands up. 
"I opened the door and said, 'I just had a baby' and just let them see everything," she said.

Pope suffers heart failure during treattnent for infection 
Pontiff's condition called 'very serious' 
A.mKiatcd Press 
Vi\TIC/\N CITY -Popn John l'aul II sufT1~rnd lwart failure during trnatmnnt for a urinary tract infnr.tion and was in "vnry snrious" condition on Friday. tlw Vatican said. 
Vatican spoknsman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said in a statn­rnnnt that the pope, who was being trnated at the VatiGan, was given cardio-respiratory assistancn after his hnart stoppnd Thursday aftnrnoon. 
"This morning tho condition of thn lfoly Father is vnry seri­ous," tho statnmont said. 
II o w n v ~~ r. i t s a i d t h at t h e pope had participated in a 6 
a.m. Mass J.'riday and that tlw popn was ·:.conscious, lucid, and snrmw. 
Thn pontiff's Jwalth dndined sharply artnr lw dnv1doped a high fnvnr Thursday brought on hy llw infection. llis wish to nHnain at tlw Vatiean was rnsJHWtnd, Navarro-Valls said. 
Tlw pontiff was allnnd11d to by llw Vatican nwdical team, and providnd with "all the appropriatn therapeutic provi­sions and Gardio-respiratory assistance," the statement said. 
Tho statement Gonfirmed previous rnports that the pope had rneeived the sacrament 
for the sick and dying on Thursday nvnning. 
i\t the ndgn of St. Peter's Square, hundrnds of people gathered early Friday, con­cerned about the fragile pope. !\ few knelt on the Gobble­stones to pray, others wrapped blankets around themselves as they kept vigil through the night. 
"There's nothing we Gan do but pray. We're all upset," said Agriculture Minister Giovanni Alemanno, who was in the Growd. 
Formerly Galled the last rftes, the sacrament is often misunderstood as signaling imminnnt dnath. It is per­formed, however, not only for patients at the point of death, but also for those who are very siek -and it may be rep11ated. 
The Home daily La Hepubbliea reported Friday that the sacrament was administnrod by John Paul's elosest aide, Polish Archbishop Stanislaw Dziwisz, who serves as his private sec­retary. I>ziwisz had given the pontiff the same sacrament on Feb. 24 just before the pope underwent a tracheotomy to insert a tube in his throat at Gemelli Polydinic, the news­paper said. 
AGeording to its aGGount, John Paul had attended Mass Thursday morning in his pri­vate Ghapel, then did paper­work !'rom an armchair. Abruptly, at 6:45 p.m., John Paul turned ghostly pale and his blood pressure plummeted, the newspaper said. 
i\f'ter antibiotics were administered, the Italian news agnney Apeom reported with­out citing any sources, John Paul's condition was "stable." ANSA, another Italian news agenGy, said the pope "seems to showing a first positive reaction" to antibiotie therapy. 
At the Gemelli hospital, an emergenGy room ehief said there were no plans to admit John Paul "at the moment," ANSA reported. 
While the pope's Gondilion deteriorated suddenly, the Vatican medical staff appeared eonfident it eould handle the erisis with the sophisticated medical equip­ment installed for the pontiff. 
As the Growd gathered to keep vigil near the pope, poliGe kept them off St. Peter's Square, forGing them to con­gregate at the edges of the giant plaza.
"i was in the ear and I heard on the radio about the grave condition of the pope. I imme­diately thought I would Gome to St. Peter's," said Antonio Ceresa, a Homan. 
As news of the pope's latest health crisis swept the world, the pontiff's spokesman, Navarro-Valls told The Assoeiated Press by telephone 

that "the Holy Father today was struGk by a high fevnr eaused by a confirmed infne­tion of the urinary tract." 
The pontiff was started on "an appropriate" Gourse of antibiotiGs, Navarro-Valls said. "The mediGal situation is being strictly controlled by the Vatican mediGal team that is taking care or him... 

Lights in tho papal apart­ment abovn St. Peter's Square were on until about 11 p.m. Thursday, generally well past the papal bedtime. The light remained on in the i\postoliG PalaGe's nursing station on the same floor as the pope's apartmeqt.

Panel dicusses political bias in mainstream tnedia 
I William Donohue, president and CEO of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, speaks in the Eck Center Auditorium. 

Writers emphasize necessity for honesty 
By KATE ANTONACCI Associate News Editor 
Notre Dame l'aeulty and distin­guished guests debated bias in the media and utTered sugges­tions to students interested in preserving truth in journalism Thursday evening in the Eek Center Auditorium. 
A panel diseussion entitled "After Objectivity: What Moral Norms Should Govern News Reporting?" was presented by the Notre Dame Journal of Law, Ethies & Publie Poliey and The Thomas J. White Center on Law & Government. 
Panelists included William Donohue, president and CEO of the Catholie League for Religious and Civil Rights; Kenneth Woodward, religion editor and senior writer for Newsweek magazine; Mareo Darbazzi, U.S. correspondent for ANSA, an Italian news agency; and Matt Sturin of the media relations division of Notre Dame Public Relations and Information and former editor of the Boston Globe. 
Robert Dunikoski, editor-in­chief of the Notre Dame Journal of Law, opened the event by deseribing the goal of his publi­cation to examine public policy with Judea-Christian values. 
Paolo Carozza, panel modera­tor and member of the Notre Dame Law School faculty, opened by addressing the issue of bias and honesty in the news. 

"There have been some very serious problems in the area of media," he said. 
Carozza said problems range from personal failings of reporters to efl'orts of systematic attempts to fabricate entire per­spectives. 
Panelists deseribed today's media and the role of balanced news coverage. 
Donohue, the first speaker, opened his talk by saying although many postmodernists today disregard the coneept of truth, the idea is essential in journalism. 
"As far as I'm concerned, .if you're a journalist and not inter­ested in pursuing the truth, then you should leave," he said. 
Donohue said today's society is almost worse than in the past in its journalistic integrity because the climate makes inconsistency and dishonesty seem aeeeptable. He did say, however, that there is more accountability today and that one is "less likely to get away with it." 
Donohue said consistency is crucial in reporting and cited many examples of past journal­ists who were "ideologically dis­turbed." 
Donohue also addressed the issue of liberal bias in the media, citing statisties that demonstrat­ed a strong liberal tilt. 
"We have this enormous gap of perception of people in media," he said. 'They think of themselves as moderate." 
Woodward then spoke about the role of different news medi­ums in society today. 
"For better or worse, we're stuek with newspapers, maga~ zines, television, radio," he said. "You can opt out of it, but how will you know what is going on?" 
While he does not use the word objeetivity, as it "suggests disinterestedness," he does believe in intelligent subjectivity, well-informed journalists, aeeu­raey and finding truth and meaning in a story. 
"Objectivity should mean and can mean no advocacy in the reporting," Woodward said. 
Woodward also said that mag­azine writers and editors look for a story line and controlling themes. 
"Journalism is not a science and not an art, but it is a craft," he said. "Morality in journalism has mueh to do with our com­mitment to the language." 
Bardazzi then gave a short presentation entitled "Four Eleetions and a Funeral," in which he diseussed four elee­tions in the past year in whieh the media incorreetly predicted outcomes. He cited the Democratic primary elections, the presidential election in Afghanistan, the 2004 U.S. pres­idential election and the Jan. 3 Iraq presidential election as instances where foreign eorre­spondents "failed in just twelve months to tell the story right." 
Bardazzi said many in Europe expected John Kerry to win the 
U.S. presidential eleetion in November.

Johnson said he does not think the victimized students in Thursday's episodes were· related to each other. He clar­ified that vehicles are typical­ly targeted by degree of opportunity. 
Upon discovering the vehi­cles, Johnson said NDSP attempted to inform affected students. The police depart­ment left a voicemail for each victimized student. 
One of the reported victims holds a high editorial position at the Observer. In early February, another highly­ranked Observer editor's car was vandalized in a similar case.

"The Italians went to bed sure that John Kerry would be the next president of the United States," he said. "It was impossi­ble [for it to go another way I and so we believed that story-and we were wrong." 
Bardazzi also said journalists are often "detached from the real men," which can lead to incorrect ideas presented in their writing. 
Bardazzi concluded by saying there are two ways to be a jour­nalist. 
"Either we inform to set peo­ple free or inform to produee consent," he said. "We need to stay in front of these realities." 
Sturin began by saying objec­tivity ean only be diseussed in a country with a free press sys-
tern. "You just 'hope the reporters get the facts straight," he said. 
Sturin said the news opera­tions department gets plenty of things wrong that are not just ideologieal. 
"In my time as a journalist, 80 pereent of criticism that a news­paper reeeived was colored by the prism of the eritie," Starin said. "Passion and opinion in a reporter are not, per se, a bad thing if controlled." 
Starin discussed liberal bias in the media, adding that when he took over as editor of the Boston Globe in 1993, he set out· to change its obvious liberal bias.

Deaths decline as attacks decrease 
BAC;IIDAD, Iraq -Insurgent attacks in Iraq have fallen dramatically since the .Jan. 30 elections, and the number of' U.S. dnaths reported this month dropped to the lowest in a year. 
But thn news isn't all good. Militants are focusing tlwir attacks on Iraqi government and security officials as the new loaders of' Iraq assume a greater role in their fragile nation. 
Both U.S. and Iraqi officials agree that attacks overall have fallen since the Jan. :HJ nlnctions, although it is unelear if the tro1HI is just a temporary lull as militants change tactics, or a sign that the insur­gency is weakening. 
Michcwl O'llanlon. a senior f'nllow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, which has been tracking tho insurgency, said attacks against U.S. forces have dropped by at least 25 percent since last fall, when 
U.S. oiTieials launched a major offensive against the insurgent stronghold of Fallujah. Attacks thon ranged from HO to 1JO a day, O'llanlon said.

Schiavo's death moves many 
Political figures continue to question the protection ofindividuals in the legal system 
Associated Press 
WASIIINGTON­President Bush on Thursday urged the coun­try to honor Terri Schiavo's memory by working to "build a culture of life" while House Majority Leader Tom DeLay said "the men responsible for this" will be called to account. 
The Florida woman, who sull'ered severe brain darn­ago after a heart attack 15 years ago, died Thursday. The foeding tube that had been keeping her alive was removed with a judge's approval on March 1 H. 
DeLay condemned the judges who at both the state and federal level deelined to order that Schiavo be kept alive artifi­cially. 
"This loss happened bocause our legal system did not protect the people who need protection most, and that will chango," _the Texas Republican said. "The time will come for the men responsible for this to answer for their behavior, but not today. Today we grieve, we pray, and we hope to God this fatn never befalls another." 
Speaking with reporters later in Houston, DeLay said lawmakers "will look at an arrogant and out of control judiciary that thumbs its nose at Congress and the President." 
Asked if that ineluded the possibility of the House bringing impeachment charges against judges involved in the Schiavo case, DeLay said, "There's plenty of time to look into that." 
"I never thought I'd see the day when a U.S. judge stopped feeding a living American so that they took 14 days to die," he added. 
White House press secre­tary Scott McClellan dndined to sign on to judi­cial criticism. "We would have preferred a difl'erent decision from the courts ... but ultimately we have to follow our laws and abide by the courts," hn said. 
Bush offered words of' 


comfort and praise for Schiavo's "families" -her parents, Bob and Mary Schindler, and her hus­band, Miehael Schiavo. 
The two sides battled for years ovnr Terri Schiavo's fate, with her parents believing she could improve and her husband insisting she would not have wished to be kept alive artificially. State court-appointed doc­tors ruled Schiavo was in a persistent vegetative state, with no real consciousness or chance of recovery. 
"I appreciate the example of grace and dignity they have displayed at a diflieult time," the president said of Schiavo's relatives. "I urge all those who honor Terri Schiavo to continue to work to build a culture of life where all Americans are welcomed and valued and 
protected, especially those 
who live at the mercy of 
others." 
Other Washington ligures 
who were deeply involved 
in the extraordinary federal 
intervention in Schiavo's 
case, particularly 
Republicans, also weighed 
in on her passing. 
Senate Majority Leader . Bill Frist, H-Tonn., said her 
death was a "regrettable 
loss of life." 
House Judiciary Chair­
man James Sensenbrenner, 
H-Wis., called on Congress 
to pass the broader legisla­
tion favored by llouse 
Hepublicans but rejected 
when lawmakers and the 
White House compromised 
to foeus only on Schiavo. 
The earlier bill, giving 
jurisdiction to federal 

courts, would apply to any easn in which there are questions about withhold­ing food or medical treat­ment from an incapacitated person. 
"Terri's will to live should serve as an inspiration and impetus for action," Sensenbrenner said. 
The White llouse didn't rule out support from tho president for new legisla­tion. 
"Obviousty we would look at it if it came to our desk," McClellan said. 
By eontrast, in the hours immediately after Schiavo's death, Demoerats -who have trnadnd carefully in the ease for fear of getting clobbered on the "values" issues that hurt them in last year's elections -mostly kept a low profile.

Speaker addresses retirement 
SMC grad advises students to save 
By MEGAN O'NEIL Saint Mary's Editor 
In a presentation born out of the "Justice f(>r All Ages" confer­ence in the fall, Saint Mary's alumna Jane Ann Schiltz spoke at the College Thursday about the importance of planning for old age and the benefits of long term care policies. 
Schiltz works for Northwestern Mutual in Milwaukee, Wis. and is the 2004-05 Shannon Scholar. The Shannon Scholar program was established in 1993 by business professor Bill Shannon in order to bring graduates to campus to share their professional experi­ences. 
Schiltz referred to the current middle-aged generation as the "sandwich generation" and said those who fall into this group face challenges unlike any known before. She and other members of the "sandwich gen­eration" are having children later in life and are then finding themselves stuck between their aging parents and young chil­dren, Schiltz said. 
"We have to deal with issues with our parents . . . while at the same time we are dealing with issues with our children," she said. 
Current middle-aged people are burdened with paying for their parents' care, Schiltz said, while saving for their children's education and contributing to their own retirement fund. 
Schiltz said individuals must think long term in order to suffi­ciently plan for their own care once they can no longer live independently. She emphasized the importance of having a "durable power of attorney" ­someone to make critical deci­sions for you if you are incapaci­tated. 
Schiltz also advised those in attendance to take inventory of their estates and maintain an updated will. People need to dis­cuss and express their wishes explicitly in order to avoid later confusion and emotional dis­tress, she said. 
The Saint Mary's alumna related a personal story in which her mother-in-law suffered a stroke. The only exi.:;ting copy of her will was locked in a safety deposit box. Her children found the key, but because the will was inaccessible, they did not have legal power to open the box and retrieve it. 

"Having these discussions early, rather than later, allows everyone to be more comfort­able with the situation," Schiltz said. 
According to Schiltz, it is never too early to begin considering who to appoint as your power of attorney and to create a written document addressing any issues that might arise in times of cri­sis. 
Schiltz said long term care insurance has been growing in both popularity and quality in recent years as the average life span lengthens. 
She also advised the audience to consider details before mak­ing an investment in long-term care insurance, such as whether you want at home care or nurs­ing home care and how much such care costs in your area. The earlier one buys a plan, she said, the better the fmancial deal they will be able to acquire. 
'The sooner you do this, the better off you are," Schiltz said.

The College is currently searching for candidates to fill the role of Vice President of Admissions and Enrollment Management, and the Comissioner Annie Davis, who will sit in on the search commit­tee. 
Another challenge unique to the upcoming administration is that of integrating the new Student Center into campus life. Mitros said the pair intends to advocate the new facility as "a women's center that promotes a sense of community." 
"With the opening of the new Student Center, the women involved in forming the women's center and defining its role on ca1,11pus have been working furi­ously to become comfortable in their new space while planning for the future of the organiza­tion," she said. "As members ol' the committee, Susan and I are extremely excited to see the progress these passionate women have been making."

"We have begun to plan a series of lectures throughout the coming school year to teach the Saint Mary's community about the amazing history of our college and of the women who have played an inte­gral role in making our college what it is today."

Pope 
continued from page I 
Malloy said he felt uncertain about the exact condition of the pope. 
"It sounded like he was tak­ing a turn for the worse," Malloy said. "It's awfully hard to sort out the degree of severi­ty." 
Evening vespers were held at Corby Hall for John Paul II Thursday night, Malloy said. 
Rougeau said John Paul II's resilience -rumors of his impending death have been circulating for years -could be viewed as a manifestation of his firm belief in the sanctity of 
human life from "Life is not really sad," conception until Balbierz said.

because we are in pain. We need to respect people at all stages." 
The pope's precarious state has also sparked debate about the existence of his living will, a document that would outline whether or not he wants meas­ures to be taken to sustain his life should he reach a near­death state. Catholics are only left to speculate since the Vatican has remained silent on the subject. 
"There is some controversy between theologians and the Vatican on the issue of euthanasia," Rougeau said. "But in the pope's case, unless it was pretty definite that there was no possibility of recovery, and even then I'm not sure, I think he would be against not taking measures to sustain his life." 
Nevertheless, measures are being taken on campus to pre­pare for the possibility of the pope's death. 
Father Richard Warner, director of Campus Ministry, said he has met with other priests to plan a special mass that will take place if the pope passes on. 
"We will have a celebration of his life," Warner said. "It will be a mass in gratitude for his service to the Church. We will have cards with his pic­ture." 
Warner said he predicts such a mass will attract not only the Notre Dame community but also residents of the greater South Bend area. 
Several Notre Dame students, like many Catholics the world over, are worried that the preparations like the last rites, though precautionary in nature, indicate the pope is getting weaker as the days pass. 
The news reached students quickly Thursday as freshman Kathryn Balbierz received an e-mail from her mother informing her of the situation. 
"My mom emailed me and

"I went to mass in St. Peter's Basilica. When I saw him, he was in bad shape," De Angelo said. "He could hardly speak, and would leave out words because he didn't have the strength to say them. In the shape I saw him, I think he will pass away soon." 
But for non-Catholics on campus, the condition of the pope, though troubling, does not stir the same emotions. 
"Honestly, I'm not Catholic," sophomore Mary Boyer said. "I haven't been following the story and since I don't know much I don't have the same reaction as my friends. They're sad, because this is the only pope they've ever known." 
University President-elect Father John Jenkins, having heard the news of the last rites earlier in the day, reflected on the need for faith in times of uncertainty. 
"It's just a somber time," Jenkins said. "What can you do? You wait, and you hope. You commend it to God's will."

Monk 
continued from page 1 

Lonnie Limon, accounting director at the Bravo Group and a '96 alum, shared how his cousin who lived in Sorin intro­duced him to Malloy during a pick-up basketball game. 
"For a Hispanic boy from Texas to meet Monk Malloy wearing shorts, goggles and a tank top," Limon said, "it showed me that he was a per­son you could touch, that was real." 
He thanked Malloy for an increase in faculty diversity, the instillation of the Latino Studies program and his freshman year advisor. 
"It was good to see a person of color in the-first year pro­gram that I could relate to," Limon said. "I think there's a long way to go, but I think you have made such great strides for us." 
In addition to his role as University president, Malloy also played the role of teacher in his popular freshmen semi­nars, Stone said. His classes became an example of how to teach and discuss diversity. 
Academic advisor in the First Year of Studies Celia Lucero discussed Malloy's impact on freshmen in his classes, which she said were designed to "enrich their humanity and empower their minds." 
Before presenting Malloy with a gift book, Lucero intro­duced two former students, Summer Shea and Marques Bolden, who shared their expe­riences from the spring 2003 seminar. 
Shea, who was adopted from South Korea at a young age and raised by an Irish family in a Caucasian community, said she struggled with her identity until taking Malloy's class. 
"The University of Notre Dame has provided me with a way to celebrate my Irish upbringing with my Korean ethnicity," she said. "Thank you, Father Malloy, for intro­ducing me to myself." 
Bolden said being introduced to people with experiences dif­fer:ent than his had a great impact on him. 
"Through our dialogue, we came to realize that our differ­ences were not hindrances, but advantages," he said. 
Chandra Johnson, Assistant Director of Cross-Cultural Ministry and Malloy's assistant for the past seven years, said, "It's been quite a ride." 
After praising Malloy's integrity and spirituality, Johnson told him, "You know that I love you." 
Malloy was also presented with two pieces of artwork. The first, a mirror created by dou­ble domer Lem Joyner, was presented by Gina Shropshire of the Black Alumni of Notre Dame. Senior Amy Peterson presented the second work, her painting of the Virgin Mary entitled "Notre Dame, our Universal Mother." 
Peterson said the painting depicts Mary outfitted in multi­cultural attire and gives her "indistinct yet identifiable skin tones," and even represents Malloy with the inclusion of dogwood flowers -a reference to the dogwood tree planted in his honor in front of the Main Building. 
After the speakers finished with their anecdotes and pre­sentations, Malloy took the podium and reflected on his childhood and career at Notre Dame. 
"One side of me, the Catholic side which prizes ritual espe­cially in times of transition, actually looks forward to these moments," Malloy said. "The other side of me hates these things, because my own per­sonal style has not been to seek personal attention." 
Malloy also referred to his athletic background during his speech. 
"The best functioning teams are when people with a variety of talents all pull in the same direction," he said. "That's real­ly what Notre Dame is to me." 
Malloy said his upbringing and early awareness of diversi­ty molded him and had a great effect on his future actions. 
I-iis father, a claims advisor in Washington D.C., would take Malloy with him in the city ­which at the time was predomi­nantly African-American -at night. 
"I would sit there in the car and try to take in the world around me," Malloy said. "I just remember how Intrigued I was by the worlds out there," he said. 
Malloy also cited his experi­ences traveling to places such as Mexico, Peru, Asia, Australia, New Zealand and Africa as eye-opening and said they expanded his horizons. 
"To bypass barriers, I know no better way than to immerse ourselves in culture, and to make friends," he said. 
Malloy offered advice that he said was inspired by John the Baptist. · 
"Prepare the way for the Lord. Try to do the best you can while you have time," Malloy said. "Be confident, under [University president elect] John Jenkins' leadership, that the momentum that's been established will be sustained." 
Malloy finished with a gym­nastics analogy to describe his futurE) after July 1, when Jenkins will assume the presi­dency. 
''I'm going from the parallel bars to the floor, because it's not as far of a distance to fall," he said.

W/\SIIINGTON -The same Congressional com­mittee that conducted hearings into steroids in baseball has asked NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue for information about how football regu­lates the performance­enhancing substances. 
The Government Heform Committee also said Thursday it will ask for similar data from the NBA, NHL, NCAA, U.S. Track and Field and Major League Soccer. 
"As the committee has stated publicly numerous times, its focus on the per­formance-enhancing drug use in sports is not limited to professional baseball," the committee said in a let­ter signed by committee chairman Rep. Tom Davis and ranking Democrat Rep. Henry Waxman. 

"As part of this investiga­tion, we are requesting basic information on steroid policies from a number of sports leagues." 
Tagliabue responded in a letter that he has directed his stafT to be fully respon­sive to the committee's request. 
"New information has called into question the effectiveness of the NFL drug policy," Waxman said in a statement Thursday. ''I'm pleased that our com­mittee will closely look at that policy as part of our continuing investigation into steroid use in sports." 
The committee asked the NFL to provide details on the testing procedures and how they were negotiated between the league and the union. It also requtlst­cd summaries of all test results during the time the testing has taken place, although not the names of individual players. The committee set next Friday as the deadline for the league to provide it with the information. 
The letter to the NFL comes a day after CBS' "hO Minutes Wednesday" reported that Panthers punter Todd Sauerbrun and center .Jeff Mitchell and former offensive linn­man Todd Steussie filled testosterone cream pre­scriptions during the 2003 season, when the team went to the Supnr Bowl.

Colts closer to stadium plan 
INDIANAPOLIS -Gov. Mitch Daniels said Thursday that he and legislative leaders have made progress on a plan that would help fund a new Indianapolis Colts stadium by imposing a one pereent restaurant tax on counties surrounding Indianapolis. 
Under the proposal, which would also pay for an expansion of the Indiana Convention Center, Marion County's food and beverage tax would rise to two pereent, from its eurrent one percent, he said. 
The governor said the tax in all eight counties would raise $21 million a year for the projects, with most of it eoming from Marion County. . 
Without imposing a one percent tax on restaurants in the seven counties around Indianapolis, Daniels said it would be impossible to raise the tax in Marion County because it would 
put those rnstaurants and bars in "an untenable, competitive disadvantage." Colorado rape suit dismissed 
DENVEH -1\ federal judge Thursday dismissed a lawsuit against the University of Colorado filed by two women whose allegations of sex­ual abuse sparked a seandal last year over its football tnam's recruit­ing praetiens. 
The plaintifl's say they wern raped by football playnrs or rncruits, but 
U.S. District .Judge Hobert Blackburn said the plaintifl's failed to mnet two key criteria in daiming tlw sehool violated fednral Title IX law by fos­tering an atmosphere that led to their alleged assaults. 
The judge said Lisa Simpson ­who has agreed to be identified in media repol'ts -and t.hn otlwr woman failed to pl'ove tho university had aetual knowledge of sexual harassment.

PSP game reviews from Mark and Trevor 
Dynasty Warriors 

"Dynasty Warriors" is one of the Playstation 2's most prof­itable franchises. Having already been seven titles on the PS2, it would seem a logical choice for a PSP launch title. However, of all the available launch titles, it may not be the best choice. 
The game plays like a weak role-playing game. The player can choose from a huge selection of historical Japanese fight­ers and then proceed to slaughter thousands of ancient Japanese soldiers. The characters level up as experience is gained. Compared to its predecessors, the gameplay has changed slightly. The huge maps have been eliminated ~nd have been replaced by a playing board. When the player moves his general onto an occupied space, the game reverts to the traditional "Dynasty Warriors" style of play. 
Graphically, the game is decent. It deserves some credit for displaying a lot of enemy soldiers at one time, but at the expense of some graphical slowdown. While the game is fun. a lack of depth and Wi-Fi playability keeps it from being one of the more essential titles. 
Overall rating: B 
Wipeout Pure 

"Wipeout Pure" is deflnitely one of the more visually stun­ning titles for the PSP. The vehicles all look terrific, especially considering the fact that it's on a portable system. The game­play matches the splendor of the visual style. 
The player gets to choose from a variety of anti-gravity rac­ing vehicles, all of which are rendered well. The tracks range from the simple to the insanely complex, giving the game lasting appeal. Additional tracks and vehicles can also be unlocked as the player progresses through the game. 
The game also supports Wi-Fi, allowing up to eight players to play together. The game doesn't lag when played over the internet -a positive point as lag could kill any racing game. Savvy garners can also find a way to browse the internet using "Wipeout Pure." Overall, this is one of the must-buys for the system. 
Qverall rating: A+ 
Twisted Metal: Head-On 

The classic vehicular combat game has finally become portable. 'Twisted Metal" has already made a splash on the original PlayStation, as well as the PS2. With all the hype sur­rounding the game, the biggest question is whether it lives up to the hype. The answer is an emphatic yes. 
The premise of "Twisted Metal" is simple -get into a car and blow everything up. And in this case, I literally mean everything. Anything from pillars to the Eiffel Tower can be destroyed, creating some of the most interactive environ­ments found on a handheld console. The selection of cars is also nice, including fifteen vehicles ranging from motorcycles to construction vehicles. 
The Wi-Fi up to six players, which can also be played over the internet. The game suffers from minor lag, but it hardly detracts from the gameplay. There arc some minor changes when played online, but they aren't obvious and are neces­sary for a smooth gameplay. Overall, a ton of unlockables and solid gameplay push this title to the top. 
Overall rating: A+

Irish almost improve to 6-5 
Sources say BC loss left off initial two­month old review 
By ARCOT RAMATHHORN 
AND RODNEY FARVA 

·learn Ramrod 
Sources inside the South Dining I I all basement have reported that Notre Dame's loss to Boston College this season Oet. 23 nearly was erased from the history books, thanks to the green-shirt wearing, rah-rah cheering Seholastie sporLo:; department. 
Notre Dame's student maga­zine, whieh eomes out every full moon, had no Boston College game reeap initially in its annual February football season review issue, sports department spokesman lrna Homer eon­firmed. 
"We felt that losing to Boston Collegn again just wasn't the kind of thing we wanted," llorner said. "So, we just prettmded it didn't happen." 
However, some outside the Sehola<;tie stall' believe the sporL<; department simply forgot to put the reeap in the February issue. 
"I mean, it's not all their fault," junior Dan Fogelberg said. "They only had sinee Oetober to fi!-,1Urn out Notre Dame did play Boston College in football this season. That's only like four months or so. Give them a break. Plus, it's probably easy to forget a game when you have so many -like 12." 
But llorner did not baek down when asked if he and the sports staiT made an innoeent mistake. 
"Liston hero," an angry llomer said. "Me and my staff wear green shirts in the press box. We do pushups in the press box when Notre Dame scores and we never, and I mean never ever ever ever, pick against the Irish in any team sport, no matter what. We are the biggest Notre Dame fans at this school and we would never criticize any Irish team. We simply wanted people to forget the Boston College loss .. If we don't put it in our February issue, maybe no one notices, and the Irish don't get the loss." 
The Absurder has learned an Scholastic staffer realized there were only 11 games in the review issue. She thought Notre Dame had played 12. After bringing up the disagreeing numbers to the editors, Scholastic's staff put their colleetive heads together and finally remembered that Boston College was, in fact, on the Notre Dame schedule this year. 
Once the mistake was caught, the sports department continued to whine and moan in opposition of the game being reviewed. 
'Our excessive cheering and grocn shirt wearing didn't help the team win against Boston College," Horner said. "We at least had to try and remove the game from everyone's memory."

Saint Mary's captures national chatnpionship 
By ANITA VOLUNTEER 

SMC Sporrs writer 
The Saint Mary's athletic department announced the for­mation of its lirst fencing team Wednesday. Thursday, the Bolles won the Division III NCM Championship. 
''I'm very proud of our girls," Bellns coach Grizzelda Williams-Williams said, "Even though thoro were no other tnarns in competition at the championship." 
The Belles swept all three events at the Championships, whieh were held in Olivet, Mich. Senior Matilda Turgsadkjladfxv took lirst place in epee, sabre and foil. Turgsadkjladfxv, who is from Hornania, was also the only mornbnr of the Belles who had ever fenced before. 
Turgsadkjladf'xv went a per­fect 15-0 at the championships, defeating the other five mem­bers of the Belles in all three events. In fact, only one other member of the Belles even scored a point against Turgsadkjladfxv. 
Williams-Williams, who is also the Belles' basketball coach and the college vice pres­ident, said the Belles overcame a lot of adversity on their way to the ehampionship. 
Turgsadkjladfxv was especial­ly impressed with her perform­ance at the championships. 
"Ja, I v·as a very good venzer," Turgsadkjladfxv said. "Ze oddah girls vere zhust awful, though. I could have von ze meet vith von arm behind my back. 
"I remember zis von match vcre I von in 12 zeconds. My dead grandvader could venze better zan dat."

Keenan stripped of title 
By ROID RAGE Sports Writer 
The season-long rumors arc true. 
Validating suspicions held by many interhall football fans, it was confirmed Thursday night the 2004 Keenan Knights would lose their title because of ram­pant steroid use.

Stop stalking me 
This is a last request from Skerd Freshman to whoever has been stalking me through Instant Messenger. 

Stop IMing me. I don't care about your problems with your mother, I don't care if you think the government is coming after you and I don't care about how much you miss your pet goat. 
Also, I am really disturbed by your habit of sending me 82 winky faces in a row followed by a kissy face. This is not attractive. If using those stupid little faces worked I would send you 100 angry faces and you would NEVER BOTHER ME AGAIN. 
In the past week I have blocked StalkRBoi, Stilwat­CHing and DuUH8me from my buddy· list. I KNOW ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE YOU. You can't fool me by talking all in caps. You can't fool me by spelling out words instead of using stupid abbreviations like r u alone. And it does NOT make any­thing you say less creepy when you say "hehehe" after it. 
No matter how many times you try to send me mp3s of "Every Breath You Take," I WILL NOT accept the file. 
Also, stop using fake facebook names to stalk me. I know this is you -there is no one in this world named Seymour Butts or Harry Bottoms. I WILL NOT BE YOUR FACEBOOK 

FRIEND. I AM TIRED OF RECEMNG EMAILS THAT YOU HAVE LISTED ME AS YOUR FACEBOOK FRIEND. JUST STOP. Also, if you are the person who calls my cell phone four

No pride for the T-shirt (boo hoo) 
I am writing to you on behalf of all the women at Saint Mary's who are really upset about the Pride Week T­shirt coverage. You see, while it stayed a current topic for a long time, I feel as though it is not getting as much attention as it should be now. 
Yes, the Student Activities Board apologized many times. And yes, they even held meetings so people could talk about the identity of a Saint Mary's woman, but I still feel like it's a really big issue that should not be dropped at Saint Mary's. 
I'm asking all Saint Mary's stu­dents to take this as a call to action. What we should do is destroy the shirts, and, in fact, make sure there are no longer any sort of Saint Mary's images put out anywhere. We should remove all campus merchan­dise. We should not make any draw­ings of students -whether they are real or imagined. And we should definitely remove the logo embla­zoned soap dispensers in the bath­room, because I do not feel they rep­resent me, as a Saint Mary's woman. 
I propose instead of focusing on new ways to improve the campus such as reveling in our new student center or seeing all the beautiful sights on campus with spring on the way, we should instead continue to focus on this atrocity that was the Pride Week Shirt for as long as the College is in existence. That is. the only way to ensure no one

The Observer 
 
IS 


oppressing me 
The student government report to the Board of Trustees didn't go far enough in describing the dire consequences of a lack of an affirmative action policy at The Observer. It was right to castigate The · Observer's gender imbalance, but it got the situation wrong when saying the problem was that that women weren't moving up in the ranks. It didn't take into account the real problem, which is the plight of the Catholic, white, upper-class male workers like myself who are in the minority on this staff. 
We're the ones affected. 
I mean really, besides some other dudes in the sports department and scattered in pho­tography and whatever other sections there are, I'm like surrounded by women. Student government has a problem with too many male editors? Have you seen this year's top staff? There's a girl, a guy, a girl, a girl and another girl. Overall there's about two to three girls for every guy. Don't get me wrong, I love the ladies. I mean, they rev my engines, but they don't belong in the newsroom! 
Very few people realize the hardships I face because The Observer refuses to adopt any sort of affirmative action policy that would actively recruit people like me and cater to their interests once hired. The new female Editor-in-Chief has actually issued a statement that says something about not discriminating at all and encouraging all people to get involved with the paper, ren­dering an affirmative action policy unneces­sary. Are you as outraged as I am? It's clear that she is purposely overlooking my demographic and trying to keep male num­bers down. 
Okay, maybe we need more Asians, blacks, Jews, transgendered South African Buddhists, what have you, to make this staff more diverse. All I'm saying is that the most pressing problem is the fact white Catholic men like myself need someone to speak for them, to represent them in media. Who at Notre Dame will work for our needs? I'm not even talking about how biased the news will be without adequate representation behind the scenes. Really I'm just worried because it makes an uncomfortable working environment since as a Notre Dame guy I don't know how to communicate with girls. 
As a disgruntled employee, I support stu­dent government's attempt to highlight this problem in their BOT report, but they're going about it the wrong way. Clearly, the problem is The Observer's refusal to allow a minority like myself to have a workplace where I can feel accepted and welcome. Until drastic changes are made and affirma­tive action geared toward white males is instituted, I'm afraid that The Observer will continue to propagate biased, unfair jour­nalism.

SMC students experience sy111pto111s of tunnel vvithdravval 
By FRENCHY CROSS 
News Wrirer 
While the weather in South Bend is improving, many stu­dents at Saint Mary's are still experiencing a disease. whieh has lwen passed around since last semester -tunnel with­drawal. 
Last Deemnber, Saint Mary's made the decision to dose the underground tunnels that many students had used to travel around campus due to exposed water and electrieal pipes. This loft many students literally out in the cold during the cold and snowy wintPr months, when the tunnels were most frequently usml. 
0 n e n u r s e i n II1Htl t h a n d Wellrwss said she knows tunnel withdrawal to have taknn its toll on a numlwr of students this snnwstnr. 
"Wn'w had rwarly half the on r.arnpus students into tlw ol'lk1~ trying to diagnose tlwir unex­plairwd symptoms: fnnling eold, frozen tons dun to wearing llip flops in tlw wintl'r and a gnrwr­al sPntinunt of fnnling glum." shn said. "Tiw tunnels may havP IHnn srary to some stu­dPnts, hut tunnl'l withdrawal has IH'Pil tWPII searil'r." 
Orw junior who wants to bn known only by the name Tina hPiinvPs slw was a victim of' tunnel withdrawal. 
"There were times I didn't even want to leave the resi­dence hall because I knew I would have to go outside," she said glumly. "I would just walk up and down the stairs for exorcise, hoping the snow would go away or by some mir­ade, the tunnels would reopen so I could go to the library." 
Other students believe they have had absolutely no symp­toms of tunnel withdrawal. 
One sophomore said she once had a seary experience while traveling through the tunnels to Trumper Computer Center and does not miss them at all. 
"I had to print a midterm last semester and was walking through the tunnels when my cell phone rang," she exelaimed. "I freaked out because I knew my cell phone got zero reception down there. Out of the corner of my oyo, I swore I saw a man and he whispered, 'Can you hoar me now? Good.' I'm glad they're closed -That guy freaks mo out!"

Luekily, students now have a tunnel option from LeMans Hall to the new student center. The tunnel, while short, is reported to be much less creepy than the other tunnels were and is said to alleviate some of the symp­toms of tunnel withdrawal. 
"We believe the .new tunnel will satisfy all those in tunnel withdrawal but are much less frightening for any students who were fearful of the other tunnels," the spokesperson said. "It's all the fun of the tun­nels without students having to get the willies." 
Snnior Nosmo King said she is thrilled with the new tunnel. 
"Sometimes I just walk baek and forth in the tunnel because it makes mo feel so much bet­ter," King said. "I use the tun­nel everyday because that is what truly is making my last semester at Saint Mary's even better."

Tau Beta Pi busted for hazing 

Engineering honor society members Tasered at initiation 
By TAZERD NERD 
News Writer 
South Bend police broke up an initiation ceremony last weekend for potential new members of Tau Beta P~ the academic fraternity for engi­neering students, who were inducted into the honor socie­ty with aggressive acts of haz­ing. 
Unruly Dean's List engineers had to be sedated by police with the controversial stun guns Tasers, as a party held at their frat house on St. Pete Street spun out of control. Underclassmen eligible for honor society admission had beer poured on them by upperclassmen who were already members, taunting them with vicious threats such as having to recite elements from the Periodic Table. 
"I had to stop at Ununnilium · because I forgot the chemical symbol," said sophomore Poindexter Curie, who with a 
3.93 grade point average decided to participate in the Notre Dame version of most colleges' Rush Weeks. ''I'm so stupid! I knew it but they kept pouring beer on me and I got it mixed up with Ununoctium, which isn't even close." 
His eyes filled with tears as he described how his older brother had been in Tau Beta Pi when he was at Notre Dame. 
"He was always telling me stories abouthow his brothers in engineering made Greek still think it's total crap that life guys at other schools look [pre-med honor society] Alpha like pansies," Curie said Epsilon Delta is still on proba­despondently.

He referred to the rampant hazing within the political sci­ence honor society, where potential members have been known to be blindfolded and sprayed with hoses in the snow until they name every Congressman from their own state. Hazing first came to the attention of ResLife when a Pi Sigma Alpha hopeful from California contracted frostbite after two days of forgetting Congressman Devin Nunes of the 21st Congressional District. 
A Tau Beta Pi member who spoke on condition of anonymity said the recent regulations on honor societies were another attempt by administration to stifle tradi­tion.

"What if all Pi Sigma Alpha can do is e-mail members twice a year about officer elections?" asked president Corr Upted. "That's what the university seems to want from us, all academics and no haz­ing, no initiations, no throw­ing kids into St. Joe's lake for not knowing which president signed the Presidential Succession Act."

she picked up the box. 
A note attached to the box said, "Something for all the late nights ahead." 
"Fifteen measly pieces of inferior chocolate to buy my love, affection and journalistic ethics?" the disgruntled editor cried. 
She concluded this implied she was cheap and actually became offended. However she did add that had the intruder left two pounds of Godiva truf­fles, or perhaps the ears off some chocolate bunnies, her sentiments towards the hope­less lothario might have been more favorable. 
In response to the pitifully absurd pick-up line, the editor said she would have been inter­ested back in the day had he joined her during her "sailing" phase. She then questioned why he didn't just deliver a bottle of chocolate sauce if he really wanted some late night fun, adding that the boy scout's advances might then have been morn titillating. 
However, the editor admitted that La Baron might very possi­bly have been trying to sweeten her up in hopes of more favor­able student government cover­age next year. 
"Well it can't get much worse than last year, though there are holdovers from last year -so you never know," the editor said. It was unclear whether she was talking about her staff or his. 
The note ended with: "Congrats again and good luck next year." 
The editor said she accepts the congratulations, but added that given his ineptitude in mat­ters of romance among other things, the Jedi Chief should reserve the love for himself. 
"Let's be honest," she said. "He's going to need it a lot more than I am." 
The Absurder opted not to contact La Baron as it believed the evidence spoke for itself.

Monson's shaved head causes copycat actions across campus 
By APATHETIC 
News Writer 
Inspired by assistant to the president Sandra Monson's shaving her head to protest the firing of head football coach Sly Eatingham. and her deelaration that it will remain so until Notre Dame 
wins  a  national  champi­ 
onship,  various  student  
groups have  run  with the  

idea for their own protests. 
Notre Dame Right to Life members shaved their eye­brows to protest abortion, opting for the drastic meas­ure instead of creating their traditional graveyard on South Quad. 
"Usually we make those crosses to represent aborted babies," said Right to Life member Rhea Publican. "But this was a lot easier, and just as effective I think. It took a lot of time to put those crosses in the ground, but only about three minutes to shave off my eyebrows." 
When some people criti­eized the action as irrelevant to the cause of ending abor­

tion, Publican seemed to frown, but it was hard to tell because her eyebrows were gone. 
College Democrats were also moved by the brave head-shaving. Members vowed to shave their goatees and get their peace sign tat­toos removed until a Democrat won the presiden­cy, prompting the College Hepublicans to laugh hysteri­cally and vow giving up smoking pipes and cigars until Hepublicans controlled all three branches of govern­ment. Then the College Democrats started crying, and the College Hepublicans stole their Barack Obama bumper stickers. 
Varsity football players decided to jump on the body hair removal bandwagon by shaving their legs to protest the absence of girls on the team. 
"We spend all our time with other dudes, we're shaving our legs until they lot girls on the team," line­backer Chase Myjersey said. "If they don't listen to this, I don't know what will change their minds." 
To protest proposals that would limit the number of business majors allowed at Notre Dame, business stu­dents vowed to take the 
opposite approach by grow­ing out their hair until any potential limits on the College of Business were dis­missed. 
"Fine, if being a liberal arts institution is so important then we'll show you what happens when everyone looks like a long-haired unkempt hippie," finance major Hichie Rieh said. "No way should there be fewer business majors or an appli­cation proeess to get into the college. I spent last summer at Deloitte with a fat salary and a gold Holex at the end of my internship, and my poli sei friend bought mufllns for his senator's wife in D.C. for unpaid academic credit. They can't make me one of those unemployable A&L guys." 
Some have expressed reservations about the effec­tiveness of shaving various body parts to raise aware­ness for a cause. 

"Well, I'd like to say that lying down in front of traffic or something would effect more change, but let's be· serious, it wouldn't," Monson said. "At least this way I inspired the football team to shave their legs."

The now aleohol policy is effective immediately and Corduroy already has University officials searching every students room for any alcohol. Tho Absurder has learned from sources inside the Main Building that any alcohol found in students' possession will be stored underneath the golden dome for future consumption by administration officials. 
Corduroy declined com­ment on those reported facts.

Studnnts will stand behind a line at. a cnrtain distaneo from the dartboard. which will be locatod outside thn main doors of O'Shaughnnssy llall. Athletes will bn abln t.o stand three inches from thn board, whiln senior non-athletos will toss a foot from the board. Froshnwn will toss their darts from tho Hocknn Mmnorial building. 
"Wn wantod thn new system to make athletns feel like pimps and freshman likn thn scum of the earth, and I believe wn havn accomplished that," Clarenee said. "Of course. we'll have to make sure that nobody walks in front of the building during tho DAHT process. 
"We don't want any unnecessary injuries." 
In order to reduce the risk of' acci­dents, DAHT times will only take place bc~tween the hours of 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. 
The dartboard will be labeled with various classes, and the student will have the opportunity to toss the dart in order to S(~lect his or her desired sched­ule. 
Fun classes like Learning About Shapes will be represented by tho hull's nye, while less exeiting classes like General Chemistry will be featured on the outer wedgns. Students who miss tho board entirely will be automatically signnd up for COHE. 
"This nnw system takes thn guess­work out of elass scheduling, and also gives our underage students a reason to go out to the local bars in order to· prac­tice," Clarence said, adding, "That last part was just a joke and is o/T the record." 
Many students w(lre in favor of the new system. 
"I like the new system a lot," Knott senior Bi_gg Playa said. "It's a whole lot easier than getting that big book full of numbers, only to find out that the num­ber for the class you thought you signed up for was actually the number for Gender Studies." 
But the positive reaction was not cam­pus wide. 
"This new system bites," Pangborn sophomore Wie Kling said. "I ended up with three sessions of COHE and two University seminars."

News Writer 
Students' questions about the impor­tance of tM current Dome refurbishment were finally answered Thursday after­noon. 
In an unexpected press conference, University officials revealed the real rea­son for the construction is to replace the statue of Mary, which is actually made of chocolate, before the onset of summer heat causes it to melt. The original statue was replaced with a chocolate duplicate in an act of vandalism earlier this school year. 
The replacement was first discovered when students in a freshman astronomy class spotted a Nestle logo on the bottom left side of Mary's robe through the tele­scope. Closer inspection revealed a foil­wrapped pure milk chocolate figure in the place where the gilt statue had once stood. 
"The doggone thing looked exactly the same as the old one," university spokesperson M. T. Wallet said. "We're not really sure how they did that without a crane or a helicopter. But they sure pulled a doozie on us." 
Although the replacement statue has held up in colder South Bend weather, officials are worried about how it will be affected by the spring thaw. As tempera­tures increase, Mary may begin to lose her shape. 
"We wanted to wait until after com­mencement," Wallet said. "But then we thought about all those graduation pic­tures with chocolate oozing down the dome. And we figured, taking it down now is easier than cleaning that sticky mess off the gilding." 
University officials considered releasing 

Do111e project replacing chocolate Mary statue 
the real reason for the refurbishment ear­lier, but were pretty embarrassed that they lost the first statue. 
"I mean, what kind of a bonehead loses a huge gilded statue?" Wallet said. "We just it would be better to try to pass it off like routine maintenance. But people were so mad anyway, we thought we might as well own up." 
Plans to keep the next statue from being stolen include covering the Dome with cooking spray every night so vandals won't be able to scale it, and surrounding the Main Building with large angry dogs. 
"Notre Dame has always worked for this friendly, loving image," Wallet said. "It's time to get mean. The new Notre Dame won't let just anyone saunter up on the Dome." 
As a consolation for covering up the dome during graduation, the university plans to use the melted down statue to throw a giant fondue party for the gradu­ating seniors and their families. The party will be held on the football field, where officials will also let people wear the foot­ball team's actual gold-colored helmets. 
"We figure, we'll swap one golden dome for another one," Wallet said. "See, that'll make for some pretty good pictures too, right?" 
Notre Dame Security/Police is still look­ing for old statue, which they hope might turn up during end of the year dorm searches. 
"It's not so easy to get a thing like that past the security gates," Wallet said. "That thing's gotta be on campus somewhere. And when it turns up, we're putting them both up there, side by side. Two Marys ... that's better than all those other Catholic schools."

University plans more changes for graduation

In response to the vehement student outcry about re-gilding the famed golden dome during spring graduation, university officials agreed to halt the re­gilding and announced that they will instead have a giant adidas logo fastened to the front of the dome's surface just in time for commencement.

Campus drinking age increases to 23 
By HOE JETTLER News Writer 
In a move that made Father Spark Richwoman cry with joy, Father President Medbard "Dunk" Corduroy changed the drinking age for all Notre Dame students to 23 years old, at a press con­ference Thursday. 
"This campus was having way too much fun," Corduroy said. "I had to put a stop to that fun immediately." 
Corduroy has also overseen the SYR's being taken out of dorms and hard alcohol pro­hibited from campus. He said upping the drinking age so no undergraduates could drink was, naturally, the next move. 
"This is one instance when the motto, "God, Country, Notre Dame," should be changed to God, Notre Dame, Country," Corduroy said. 
Additionally, Corduroy said any student under 23 caught drinking any alcohol any­where in the world will be forced to watch film of Notre Dame's football games against Southern California during the past three sea­
sons. On top of that punish­ment, students will be sus­pended from class and forced to move into the radiation building. 
Former student body presi­dent Never Getanythingdone welcomed the change with open arms. 
"I think this is great," Getanythingdone said. "I think students should focus on studies more, rather than spending all their time and money having fun drinking. This will not only make stu­dents lives filled with far less fun, but also allow them to have more money to donate to Notre Dame." 
Students, however, were quite enraged. 
"How can they do this to us?" Iluv Boat said. "What will the administration do next? Put scaffolding up around the dome for gradua­tion?" 
Fellow student Corbys lsthebest agreed. 
"I'd much rather drink heavily and kill my brain cells then study and get good grades," Is thebest said. "I guess I'll have to go to class

IEWPOINT I 
Friday, April 1, 2005 page 11 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
An open letter to John Affleck-Graves 
After reading "Seniors, administrators still divid­ed over the dome" in the Observer on Wednesday, March 30, I was most dissatisfied with both your response and the University's response to the needs of students, especially to those of the graduating senior class. 
Had this been the first instance of the administra­tion's indifference to the student body, I would have been peeved but nowhere near as enraged as I cur­rently find myself. I will not, however, dwell upon the numerous instances of outright indifference and/or concern for mere profit that I have observed through my years at the University of Notre Dame. Nevertheless, I will use the controversy over the re-gilding of the golden Dome as symbol of the administration's apathy and outright antagonism to the needs and desires of students. 
To say, as you are quoted as saying, "We realize this iS>" a disappointment to the senior class," is the ultimate understatement. While you attempt to downplay the importance of the physical symbol of the golden Dome, you neglect to mention the heavy importance that the administration places upori the very symbol you seek to deny the importance of. The question arises as to why the administration chooses to place the golden Dome on the forefront of applications, brochures and media guides. To say the least, the golden Dome is one of the most important marketing images that the University of Notre Dame employs. The importance of the Dome, however, extends well beyond marketing. If the importance of the Dome were minimal, would Notre Dame students and alumni be referred to as "Domers" throughout the world? Would the football team have kept their golden helmets for so long? Clearly, the importance of the golden Dome as physical symbol of the university is undeniable. 
You, sir, however, deny the importance of the Dome continually, as you state, "Graduation is not about the physical Dome. You don't remember standing in front of it getting your picture taken." Contrary to your assertion, the main building and Dome form an essential part of the graduation fes­tivities. Since you state that you have had two chil­dren graduate from Notre Dame, I am sure you are aware of the tradition that demands undergradu­ates do not set foot on the steps in front of the main building until they graduate. Throughout my four years, my fellow classmates and I have looked forward to the day where we can set foot on the steps and have our picture taken on the steps of the main building with the golden Dome glinting in the sun above. Such a moment was me11nt to signify the completion of the enormous journey that we unaertook as freshman four long years ago. 
Upon graduation this year, my classmates and I will stand proudly on the steps although the Dome will not be glinting above, as the view will be replaced by a grotesque network of metal scaffold­ing obscuring the Dome. At first, I was enraged by the prospect of not possessing the picture I had dreamed of taking as a freshman. Now I am excited about the photo opportunity. What other photo­graph could better convey the administration's complete indifference and antagonism towards stu­dents? 
Perhaps your two children could have alerted you to the outrage that the scaffolding would provoke from the graduating senior class, as you claim that you "did not anticipate the huge reaction from the class." Although you insist that undergraduates are your top priority, one would assume that a person's top priority would be at the forefront of his mind when confronted with new developments that would affect that supposed top priority. Although you suggest that at "other times the Dome has been re-gilded the students have not been so upset," what you shrewdly fail to mention is that the last time the Dome was re-gilded the process began one week after graduation. Of course with no students present on campus -as they all headed happily home with their memories and photographs docu­menting many of these memories -few students would express their outrage of the scaffolding obscuring the Dome. 
While the administration and you use the length of time necessary for the re-gilding process to jus­tify the early start date for the process, I am left wondering whether your decision reflects a desire to save money by not springing for overtime costs or just mere ignorance concerning the needs and desires of students. I can hardly help laughing to myself when I remeinber a story I was told on the tour of the University of Notre Dame, a tour, which was instrumental in my desire to attend this uni­versity. The story proceeded as follows: 
"During the spring of 1879, tragedy befell the still young University of Notre Dame, as the main building burned to the ground, destroying class­rooms, eating facilities, offices and much of the library collection. Father Sorin, founder of Notre Dame, however was undeterred by the tragedy. In a famous speech he vowed, 'If it were all gone, I should not give up ... Tomorrow we will build again, and build it bigger.' Through hard work and determination, 300 laborers rebuilt the entire main building larger and grander in just one summer. The new main building was ready by the time stu­dents arrived in September despite the seemingly insurmountable obstacle that Father Sorin faced three short months previous when the building burned to the ground." 
Having listened to such stories and being trans­formed by such a beautiful and unique campus, I was determined to attend the University of Notre Dame, even if it was beyond my family's means. Now we are told merely the re-gilding of the Dome will take over six months and will be completed by October. How is it that men working in the heat of the summer of 1879 can build the premier symbol of Notre Dame in three short months but the tech­nology and professionalism of laborers in the 21st century cannot refurbish the Dome and statue of Mary in less than six months? 
Finally, I feel compelled to respond to the invita­tion for suggestions about how to deal with the sit­uation and how to make up the horrible loss to the senior class. I offer my suggestions in reference to your appeal: "If seniors have suggestions we will entertain everything ... but I know the seniors are paying a price and we can never fully compensate." To you sir, I humbly ask that you refrain from solic­iting donations from members of my class, for your requests will fall meekly upon deaf ears hardened by four long years of neglect.

Sex and the City? Not this city 
Upon reading "Sex and Ivy League isn't an oxymoron" [Associated Press, March 30], I was surprised at the casual tone of the article and how casual­ly the contents of the book, "Chloe Does Yale," were being treated. In a way, I was somewhat jealous. 
Recently, I happened to come across Natalie Krinsky's novel and couldn't help but notice its premise. Krinsky was able to write a "Sex and the (Elm) City" column for the Yale Daily News and it was no big thing. It was just a daily column. I then asked myself why a prestigious institution like Notre Dame did not have anything comparable to that. In fact, we have nothing remotely close. If the Ivy leagues can talk about sex, why can't we? There is no dialogue about sex, relationships or drunken hookups. We like to call ourselves the "Harvard of the Midwest," but even Harvard has a sex maga­zine, H Bomb, which started last year. The mere mention of the Vagina Monologues causes an overwhelming controversy here. We seem to find conversations about relationships, gender issues and gender interactions trivial and unimportant. If it isn't an "intellectually stimulating" conversa­tion or debate about Conservatives or Liberals, Notre Dame students can't be bothered. I mean, who has time to actually date someone? A random hook-up on the weekend will suffice as long as no one mentions it again. No one wants to look like a floozy, so it must be better not to talk about it. 
I understand that this is a Catholic institution and, of course, we, as stu­dents, strive to adhere to the Catholic teachings, but that does not mean sex and drunken hook-ups do not happen. It also does not mean we cannot talk about these issues either. I am not saying that this behavior is always moral but rather suggesting the possibility for dialogue. Maybe, a dialogue of sorts would help to relieve the awful tension between genders. I think most will agree that the dating scene at Notre Dame is less than stellar. However, maybe if we weren't so hesitant to discuss the conflicts of the many differ­ent relationships, there wouldn't be as much of a strain. 
Or maybe if we can keep pretending that if these topics of conversation should cease to be brought up, then we can pretend that sex and hook-ups don't happen.

Baron's plans for a swift tran­sition will allow the adminis­tration to begin accomplish­ing its goals prior to the school year's end. 
The new administration has already created the "Catholic Think Tank," an initiative aimed at bringing prominent Catholics to campus. Baron said he hopes to find an inau­gural speaker for the project to visit campus in April. 
"We are going to try to get someone here by the end of the year," he said. "We are looking around for prominent speakers to kick off Catholic Think Tank." 
Baron and Shappell have also begun working on the cornerstone of their cam­paign's platform -communi­cation. Both said they will increase on all levels -from the dialogue between student government and student body to the dialogue between stu­dent government and the greater South Bend commu­nity. 
To ensure students know their voices are being heard, Baron, Shappell and Kozlow have decided to grant issue. The com­
munity has 
much to offer." 

In addition to these goals, Baron hopes to have printers, wireless access and cable tel­evision in the dorms by the time students return to cam­pus in the fall. 
Baron said his experience as chief assistant to former student body president Adam Istvan provided him with valuable insight into the most effective way to manage stu­dent government and reach the goals he has set out to accomplish. 
"I learned a lot from [Istvan and former vice president Carla Bell's] style of leader­ship," Baron said. ".Adam showed me the importance of having strong convictions and not always compromising on them." 
Though their platform was thorough and their promises are plentiful, one over-arch­ing theme defines it all, Baron said. 
"Our entire focus is to unite and mobilize 8,000 people," he said.

Sporrs Wri1er 
Tlw spring snason will kiek-olf f(lr the Saint Mary's golf team this wnnkond as the Belles travel to Capital University in Columbus, Ohio to compete in the Purple and While Invitational. Saint Mary's will begin its season with mueh the same expeetations it has had the past eouple of years. 
The Bnllns are looking to be selnctnd for the third year in a row for the NCAA competition, which will take place in early May. 
This wenknnd's evnnt is one of Jive that Saint Mary's will com­pete in throughout the month of April, and tho tnarn's primary goals are simple -play well nnough to qualify f(lr the tourna­nwnt and peak at tho right time.

ofjuniors and seniors. 
Coach Mark Hamilton is confi­dent in his playnrs' ability, espe­dally since the core of the team has been together for three years. 
"They know the ropes," Hamilton said. "They've played in some big tournaments... they have the experience that it takes." 
One thing that will not be on the Bnlles' side this weekend will be the weather. The team is play­ing on an unfamiliar course and has a history of giving a substan­dard porformance when the woathnr is less than decent -the forecast for Columbus, Ohio calls for rain. 
Hamilton looks at this invita­tional as an opportunity for the team to improve on its overall performance in bad conditions. 
"One of our focuses is on learn­ing to be better rnudders, to be able to perform better than everyone else when tho weather is poor," Hamilton said. 
Saint Mary's will certainly want to be at the top of its game this weekend. competing against some of the top programs in the region. 
The Purple and White Invite is in its fifth year and will play host to Ohio Athletic Conference champion Otterbein College, American Mideast Conference champion Walsh University and defending tournament champion Wilmington College. 
This is the first year that the Belles have taken part in the invi­tational, as it was a good fit in the schedule and, according to Hamilton, a good test to see what the ladies would need to improve on in the next month. 
The competition begins at 
10:30 a.m. with a shotgun start and will continue through Saturday.

Saint Mary's, Adrian ~chedule scrimmage 
By KATE SERYAK 
SportS Writer 

On Saturday, younger members of the Belles tennis team will travel to Adrian College in Michigan to scrimmage the Bulldogs. 
Although Adrian is usually an MIAA conference mem­ber, this year it laeked the sufficient interest in the pro­gram to field a team. Nevertheless, MIAA teams have scheduled scrimmages with the remaining members so that they still have a ehanee to play this yoar. 
The  Belles  are sending  
seven  girls, mainly fresh­ 
man.  

"All of them are really excited to play in their first college match," captain Miranda Mikulyuk said. "This is a chance to give tho regular players a break and allow the backup players to gain some valuabln nxpnri­ence/' 
The Belles' season has got­ten off to a slow start, with a match against Olivnt College having been rescheduled on two different occasions. Saint Mary's match against the University of Chicago is its only match of the regular season so far, aside from preseason matches played over spring break. 
"It's hard to say how our season is going because we've only had one match," Mikulyuk said. "But we had a really good doublns pnr­formancn at the University of Chicago match. "Dun to an injury, we had to switch the lineup, and we playPd with partrwrs that we hadn't really practicnd with at all. The fact that w.-pnrfornwd well in such a situation is awesonw, and I think that will dictate how our soason will go." 
Tho Belles arP looking for­ward to bnttnr wnatlwr in coming wonks so thoy can start eonsistnntly practicing outsidn.

Streaking Irish journey south to battle SMU 
By KATE GALES Associate Sports Edtior 
Good things come in threes, and wins are always good things. 
The No. 29 Irish look to extend their winning streak to three games on a road trip to Dallas this weekend as they take on the No. 41 Mustangs of Southern Methodist University. · 
"We're excited to go to Dallas," coach Bobby Bayliss said. "It's supposed to be 75 degrees and sunny." 
As weather improved in South Bend, the Irish got a taste of what they would find in Dallas on the Mustangs' outdoor courts. Although the Irish carry a more favorable ranking, SMU boasts a perennially competitive squad. 
"They're a dangerous team," Bayliss said. "They just lost a real close 5-2 match to Oklahoma State, who's No. 10. ... They had chances to really make it pretty darn competitive. I'm anticipating a tough match." 
Notre Dame and SMU are 2-2 in the four~year history of the series, which Bayliss started because 'the Big East does not require round-robin play in the conference. 
"The way the series has gone, we've won the two matches in South Bend and they've won the two in Dallas," he said. "Both were 4-3 matches, with the last match on the court [clinching the wins)." 
Bayliss anticipates a challeng­ing match in the Lone Star State this Sunday. 
"We want another close-hard fought match and they're pretty good," he said. "Their team is

predominantly international

returning from last year. I think 
five of the six starters are back." 
The Irish recovered from a dif­
ficult 6-1 loss to No. 2 Illinois on 
March 17 to win matches at 
Michigan and Purdue. The line­
up has seen a number of 
changes this season, as the top 
spot has been back and forth 
between sophomore Stephe·n 
Bass and senior co-captain Brent 
D'Amico. 
"He had the best fall of any­
one," Bayliss said of Bass. "We 
have the type of team where our 
guys are pretty close to each 
other in ability. There's not a 
great disparity ... Stephen had to 
play some outstanding players 
early in the season and took 
some losses, and I think his con­
fidence suffered a little bit." 
Bayliss moved D'Amico into 
the top position but saw little 
change in the overall results of 
the match. 
"Stephen immediately started 
winning at two, and Brent 
encountered some of the same 
problems Stephen had," Bayliss 
said. 
Although the lineups for this 
weekend are not set, Bass has 
occupied the No. 1 spot in the 
most recent matches. 
"We've had good solid results 
throughout our lineup all year, 
especially in singles," Bayliss 
said. 
The coach does not plan to 
change the doubles combina­
tions, although the lineup is 
always subject to change. . The Irish will face the 
Mustangs at 1 pm.

Saint Mary's hopes to end streak 
By TOM STILES Sports Wrirer 

Saint Mary's (5-8) will look .to end its current five-game 
skid this weekend when it 
plays in the Trinity 
International Tournament. 
The tournament will likely 
serve as a good test for the 
Belles before they begin a 
string of games against MIAA 
rivals. 

Most recently, the Belles 
lost both ends of a double­
header to Manchester College 
by scores of 4-2 and 1-0 on 
March 17. Both games saw 
quality pitching performances 
squandered by poor fielding 
and weak hitting. 

In game one, junior Bridget 
Grall gave up two earned 
runs and nine hits -only one of which went for extra bases -but the Belles committed three errors and could muster only one run on offense. Game two saw fresh­man McKenna Corrigan pitch a two-hit gem, but the offense was shutout with three hits and the defense gave up another unearned run. 
The season has been a roller coaster ride for the Belles thus far, as the team won four straight earlier in the year only to drop the next five. 
The Belles have yet to put it all together, with the offense and the pitching rarely per­forming well in the same game. 
As of late, both the pitching and the hitting have strug­gled, as the Belles have been outscored 31-7 in the last five games. 

The Belles have been marred by inconsistent play, which can be expected of a young team. 
Mother Nature isn't cooper­ating either, as the Belles' last two home games have been postponed. Finding a rhythm has been difficult for Saint Mary's, as the tourna­ment will be the first action they have seen since March 17. 
Upon returning from the tourney, the Belles will begin a stretch of 19 games in 25 days before the MIAA Tournament in early May. The Belles will face Tri-State University on Monday and Albion College on Wednesday.

The tnam lwads to West 
Lafityette, Ind. to compete in the Poehlein Invitational, named after former long-time Purdue coach Mike Poehloin. The non­scoring invitational meet was originally scheduled as a two­day meet for today and Saturday, but all events were moved to Saturday. 
Tlw meet will be another early opportunity for tho Irish athletes· to qualify for Big East and NCAA regional compntitions, but assis­tant coach Tim Connelly eau­tiorwd against peaking too soon. 
"Tho NCAA's are a long ways away," Connelly said. "You have to spread out the competition, and build up so that you peak fi1r tho NCM's." 
As a result of' already having qualif'ied for NCAA's and the large amount of' time before the NCM's, sophomore distance sen­sation Kurt Benninger will not be competing this weekend. 
Benninger shatternd the Notre Damn school record in the 5,000-meter race last weekend at the Stanford Invitational with a time of' 13:33.05, a full two sec­onds under the pmvious record. The performance was the third fastest in the world thus far. 
The majority of tlw team will be competing, however, as tho number of NCAA qualifiers looks to grow.

Competitive field slated for invite

Sinee Jim Kubinski t.ook over as head coach on Jan. 2S, tho Irish havn postml low seores and earnnd nxeP.ptional finish­es. 
This wnnkend, though, the tnam will f'acn its toughest test in the Augusta State Invitational, wher!1 l S of' the best squads in the country will square ofT in a mid-spring showdown. 
Ten of' the nation's top 25 teams will tne it up this wonk­end at Fornst Hills Golf Club in Augusta, <;a., including ·No. 4 Georgia, No. 6 Wakn Forest and No. 9 Duk!1. 
Notre Dame, entering the weekend at No. 62 in tlw Golfstat rankings, havn P.arned one win and two other top-five finishes in three tournaments this spring under the tutnlage ofthP-ir nP-w head coach. 
Hownvor, the team will be hard pressed to replicate the early-spring success thP.y have enjoyed against this field. 
Among the golfers in the fip,Jd for opposing teams arn thme of the top 15 individual golfers in the country -Hyan Blaum of Duke, Gm1rgia's Chris Kirk and Georgia Southern's Aaron Price. Blaum, Kirk and Price each have a searing average bolow 70. In comparison, Notre Dame's best scoring avP.rage belongs to Cole lsban, who is ranked 117 in th!1 country with a 71.71 average. 
According to the Invitational's official website, 31 of tho coun­try's top 100 individual golfers will be competing. lsban and his teammates will have to play their best if they want to stay competitive on Sunday. 
But history is not on Not.rn Darm~·s side. 
Last year, Minnnsota won tlw tournament going away. Tlw Golden Gophnrs outpaend Duke and UCLA by five and six strokes, rnspnctiwly. No otlwr tmun finish1~d within I 0 shots of' tiH~ winnn_rs. 
Tlw Irish ended last year's tournarnnnt in a tin for four­teenth with Georgia Soutlwrn and Toledo at S92 (+2Sl. That was thirty-one strokt~s behind Minnesota's winning scorP. This year, the team hopes to at lnasl. have a f'ighting chance come the final round. 
The competition is not the only factor that is working against the Irish, though. Tlw eourse, itself', also ofl'ers a sig­nificant challenge f'or Notre Damn. 
While the Irish's honw eoursP of' WarrP-n consists almost entirely of bent grass on tlw fairways and grmms, as is cus­tomary for northern courses, Forest II ills is l 00-percnnt B1wrnuda.

ND WOMEN'S LACROSSE 
Irish set to welcome pair of Big East foes 
By MATT PUGLISI Associate Sports Editor 
Notre Dame may only have seven of 15 regular season con­tests under its belt, but for the Irish (2-5, 0-1 Big East), the must-win games are already beginning. 
After a 2004 campaign that saw the Irish drop just five con­tests all season -they finished 12-5 overall -the 2005 squad has already equaled last year's loss total in its first seven games. 
For the team to have any hope of making a run at the Big East title and qualifying for the NCAA tournament come May, it must begin to turn the tide. 
This weekend provides a per­fect opportunity 
Dominion, 9-8, in its most recent contest on Monday. 
The Irish take the field tonight after a heartbreaking 10-9 overtime loss to Big East rival Boston College on Saturday-Notre Dame lost by an identical score in overtime to Vanderbilt on March 9. 
Falling behind 6-2 at half­time, the Irish battled back to tie the game seven minutes, 4 7 seconds into the second half at six and then traded goals with the Eagles for the remainder of regulation. 
Although attack Crysti Foote was able to knot the score at nine with only 1:07 left on the clock and force overtime, it was 'he last time Notre Dame found the back of the net on the afternoon.

tonight at Moose Krause Field at 7 p.m. before facing the Scarlet Knights Sunday at noon. 
Notre Dame coach Tracy Coyne realizes the impact the next two games will have on the floundering 2005 season. 
"It's a huge [weekend]," Coyne said. "At this stage, every game is important, and we can't be overlooking any­one. We've only started Big East play, and this is a big weekend in the conference. 
"I think if we want to keep our hopes alive for wining our first conference championship and getting the automatic bid, we have to win this weekend." 
The Irish haven't had much trouble disposing of the Huskies in the past, taking five of the six all-time matchups between the teams, including a 14-8 victory last season. 
Connecticut enters this evening's game on the heels of a tough 13-12 loss to No. 15 Syracuse on Saturday. 
Historically, Notre Dame has had a little more trouble with Rutgers, though the Irish have still managed to win three of five all-time meetings. The Scarlet Knights were one of four teams to beat the Irish last year, picking up a hard-fought 7-6 victory in Piscataway, N.J. last April. 
Rutgers was edged by Old 
cution that dropped the team to 2-5 on the season. 
"It wasn't a situation where talent-wise we were over­matched and we had to play out of our heads," Coyne said. "I think it was more a case our lack of execution led to mis­takes and then Boston College was able to capitalize." 
According to Coyne, an inability to prepare for the fiercely competitive contest could also have contributed to the loss. 
"It's slightly a one-sided rivalry -[Boston College] had never beaten us, and they have some girls on their team that wanted to come to Notre Dame," Coyne said. "I thought we were prepared for it, but I just think that they came out with a lot more intensity." 
While Notre Dame certainly didn't expect the 2-5 mark that accompanies its name in the standings, the results this sea­son may not be as bad as the record might indicate. 
"We lost two overtime games and one game by three goals, so our record could easily be 5­2," Coyne said. "We're there­we're doing some things well, we're just not finishing the play."

ND WOMEN'S TRACK 

'Pace' remains key for team 
By RYAN KIEFER Sports Writer 
Pace is a word that is used in track jargon constantly. Usually the term "pace" describes how fast someone is running in a race. 
But Irish coach Tim Connelly isn't concerned with this type of pace. Instead, his team's ability to pace itself throughout the season has been the coach's focus this week. 
Following one of the most suc­cessful weekends of the year for the women's track team-when it notched six NCAA qualifying times and proved itself to be competitive with top level teams -Connelly refused to let his team get ahead of itself. 
"We need to temper our enthu­siasm a bit," Connelly said. "Last weekend was simply a good starting point, a good first race. There's still two months until NCAA Regionals." 
In an effort to establish this 

theme, the Irish will take on less­
er competition this weekend but 
will send their entire team to the 
Poehlein Invitational tomorrow at 
Purdue. 
The team was originally sched­
uled to compete at Indiana University this weekend but chose instead to go to Purdue. The meet in West Lafayette, Ind. · held on Saturday will allow ath­
letes to attend Friday classes. 
The Purdue meet will give ath­
letes who have not yet participat­
ed in an outdoor meet the oppor­
tunity to compete in the ele­
ments. 
"You have to look at the condi­
tions when you run outside," 
Connelly said. "So many times 
performances can be dictated by 
the elements. We have to get 
used to these conditions. 
Saturday provides us with anoth­
er race in which to do this." 
Connelly also said some of his 
top distance runners will be com­
peting in shorter events such as 
the 1,500-meter to help pace 
some of the less experienced run­ners. This will allow the distance 
team to get some rest after last 
weekend while helping team­.mates in the process. 
With the outdoor season still in 
its early stages, the Irish's goal is 
to gain racing experience. 
Technique and strategy were 
strong points of Notre Dame's 
performance last weekend, and 
Connelly will be stressing those 
areas again this weekend. 
"We raced very well last week­
end," Connelly said. "We were 
patient and waited for our oppor­
tunities. That was our biggest 
accomplishment last weekend, 
and it was much more important 
than just burning ourselves out 
like in a time trial. Smart racing 
is the ultimate goal." 
Louisville, Indianapolis, Illinois­
Chicago, Chicago State, 
Marquette, Loyola Chicago and 
Purdue are among the schools 
expected io compete against the 
Irish this weekend.

Squad returns to action in· Indiana 
Cold climate expected to present problems 
By CHRIS KHOREY Sports Writer 
Three weeks after its victory in the St. Croix Collegiate Invitational in the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Notre Dame women's golf team returns to action this weekend. in a much cooler cli­mate in Bloomington, Ind., home of the Indiana Invitational. 
The competition will mark the first northern tournament for the Irish since the weather last per­mitted for outdoor competition in early October, when the team participated in the Shoot Out at the Legends in Franklin, Ind. 
Junior Suzie Hayes said the three-week layoff is common at this point in the season. 
"[Spring break] is a great time to get practice in the heat and the sun, but then we usually have a break because of the weather," she said. "The next three tourna­ments are up north." 

The Irish did their best to stay sharp during the off weeks, tak­ing a trip to Rochester, Ind.·last weekend to practice away from the Warren and Notre Dame golf courses. 
"We've been working hard on our games," Hayes said. "We've been outside most of the last three weeks." 
Taking to the links for the Irish will be sophomores Stacy Brown and Noriko Nakazaki, juniors Katie Brophy, Sarah Bassett and Hayes and senior Karen Lotta. 
Brophy leads the team with a 
75.83 stroke average but shot a 7 5-82-79 in three rounds at St. Croix. Brown paced the Irish in the VIrgin Islands with 75-79-74 scores. 
The Irish are a combined 23-0 against opponents they will face in Bloomington. 
Notre· Dame is currently ranked No. 45 by golfstat.com. Challenging the Irish will be No. 70 Wisconsin, No. 84 Minnesota and No. 99 Iowa, among 14 other teams. 
Rounding out the field will be Indiana, Arkansas-Little Rock, Ball State, Bowling Green, Eastern Michigan, Ferris State, Grand Valley, Illinois, Indianapolis, Iowa, IPFW, Marshall, Minnesota, Ohio, St. John's, Toledo, Wisconsin and Xavier. 
The Hoosiers will also enter six individual competitors who will not count toward the team's score. 
Despite the mediocre competi­tion, Hayes said the team is not overconfident. 
"We know we want to win, but we're not going out there saying 'oh, this is an easy tournament,"' she said. "We just want to play well and lower our scoring aver­ages." 
The forecast for Saturday is sunny and 45 degrees, much cooler than St. Croix but dry and playable. 
"We're used to the conditions," Hayes said. "This tournament always seems to have cold weather. It won't affect us too much."

appeared to have sealed the victory, but a controversial call on a play at first base kept the game going. The Irish lost in an epic 19-inning battle. 
"We've got a little bit of a sour taste in our mouths from that game because we thought we won the game," Mainieri said. "The game should have been over. We were running ofl' the field to celebrate, and the umpire made a call that we thought was wrong. 
"When our first baseman went baek to argue the call, the runner ran home from third to tie the game. It cost us the reg­ular season ehampionship." 
Junior Cody Hizzo is one of six players on the current Irish roster who was involved in the 5-3 loss two seasons ago that lasted almost live hours. Hizzo remembers it well and is excit­ed to face such a quality oppo­nent this weekend. 
"It's going to be a test," Hizzo said. "We've sort of started to turn the season around a little bit, and this is going to show us how we're doing. 
"It's a rivalry every year. To go out there and have their fans cheering against us gets you going every game." 
Hutgers is coming off an 11-2 home-opener victory over Hider. First baseman/outfielder Hyan Hill leads the Scarlet Knights with a .393 batting average in only 28 at-bats. The top every-day hitters for the Knights are infielder Cory Hodriguez (.369, 84 at-bats), outfielder Johnny Defcndis (.351. 97 at-bats) and first basmnan Hich Canuso (.323, 65 at-bats). Infielder Todd Frazier has six home runs. 
The Knights have already knocked o!T No. 3 Georgia Tech and swept Big Ten power Minnesota this season. 
Irish freshman second base­man Brett Lilley continues to pace the Notre Dame offense with a .384 batting average. Senior first/third baseman Matt Edwards has blasted his way to 
a .382 average after a solid midweek game against Western Michigan in which he homered three times over the le'ft field fence. llis home run total is nine through 23 games. 
Though this weekend's series takes place early in the confer­ence schedule, the two peren­nial conference title contenders are tied atop the Big East standings at 3-1. Mainieri rec­ognizes the importance of the series. 
"I think they're very impor­tant games, very critical games beeause if you want to beat teams out for the champi­onship, you better boat them head to head." he said. "Tlwy're eritieal becausn you know that they'rn IHutgnrsl going to be a main eontnndnr for the I Big East I champi­onship."

Two-sport standout .Jeff Samardzija will pitch ganH~ three of the series. With a 3-0 reeord, Samardzija should be an imposing third ganw pitch­er. lie will fly to Newark Airport on Saturday night after an al'ternoon football practice.

and earned first team All-Big East for Notre Dame this sea­son. 
"That is so important to have a good leader, you can't win without a leader," McGraw said. "I think Megan's going to run the team like she did this year, and she's improved every year." 
Duffy will be joined in the backcourt by defensive stopper Breona Gray, who had a solid sophomore season, and fresh-. man Tulyah Gaines, who gained valuable experience in a back­up role this season. 
"Tulyah really came on at the end of the year," McGraw said. Borton's inside presence will 
be filled by another freshman, Melissa D'Amico. The 6-foot-5 forward/center saw limited action this season, but McGraw thinks she will be a big contrib­utor next season, playing in the post next to returning starter junior Courtney LaVere and sophomore Crystal Erwin. 
"[D'Amico] is going to be a dominating presence in the lane for us on both ends of the floor," McGraw said. "I think that she is talented, she works hard, and I really feel like she is going to play a major role for us inside. Not so much in scoring, but just in contributing." 
And even with these three freshmen seeing increased roles next year, Notre Dame will get even younger with two top recruits coming in: McDonald's All-American Lindsay Schrader and honorable mention All­American Chandrica Smith. 
Schrader will join the Irish out of Bartlett, Ill. The 2005 Illinois Ms. Basketball is a pure scorer, averaging 22.1 points per game her senior year. 
"She's someone who can shoot the ball, score from the perimeter, rebound-she's got a lot of strengths on offense," McGraw said of Schrader, who scored nine points in the All­American game Wednesday night at the Joyce Center. 
Smith will bring an athletic presence to the Irish. 
"Chandrica is a great defend­er who can rebound, which was a huge weakness we had this year,".McGraw said.

The Notre Dame defense wraps up a Stanford player during last October's game. Next year's defense will have to replace two starting linebackers. 
Defense

returning Irish linebackers with sizable game experience. They will need to fill holes left by the departure of Mike Goolsby and Derek Curry and also adapt to the terminology used by new Notre Dame defensive coordinator Rick Minter. 
"There is some different lingo here and there, but there's a lot of carryover in everything we do," Mays said. "There will be a little change, but just like class, you have to study and get everything down. If you just spend 15 to 20 minutes of dedication every day, you can get things down pat." 
Despite the inexperience of this year's linebacking corps, there is plenty of talent to compensate. 

Juniors Mitchell Thomas, Joe Brockington and Nick Borseti return and will compete for a spot in the 4-3 set. Sophomores Abdel Banda and Maurice Crum, Jr. are expected to push the veter­ans. 
Chinedum Ndukwe, who logged minutes at safety as a sophomore last year, will play a hybrid posi­tion, mixing duties of a safety and linebacker. 
"I don't think it's anything ingenious," Minter said. "I think the best thing for us to do right now is to play with [Ndukwe] on the field as a 'nickel-backer' type guy." 
According to Minter, Hoyte and Mays are the frontrunners for number-one spots, along with Ndukwe, but no one is assured of anythingjustyet. 
"Right now we're just compet­ing for spots and not locked in too much," Minter said Wednesday after Notre Dame's second spring practice. "But when the dust set­tles I'd like to see [Mays] at [mid­dle] linebacker. He's that proto­typical, big, thick-bodied guy that plays in the middle, and then I'll put Hoyte on the flank some­where." 
Despite his coach's confidence in his ability to contribute this season, Hoyte is taking nothing for granted. 
"It's really simple," Hoyte said. "I need to prove myself. Some people would say as a fifth-year. linebacker that's already been done, but I don't think so. I don't think I've played up to the possi­bilities I'm capable of, so in my viewpoint, I'm no different than a freshman."

NO WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 

McGraw, players reflect on season 
Tournament upset brought campaign to sudden conclusion 
By HEATHER 
VAN HOEGARDEN 
Sports Writer 

The women's college basket­ball season concludes this weekend in Indianapolis, but the Irish will be watching on their television sets. After their season started with high hopes of Notre Dame's first Final Four since the 2001 national champi­onship, the Irish were upset by fifth-seeded Arizona State 70­61 on March 21 in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. 
"We met and watched the film and really I wanted them to take the pain with them," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said. "I wanted them to remember the pain they felt in the locker room after the game and not to ever want to go through that again. It's all a mindset, it's an attitude that you have to have, and we just didn't seem to have it in the beginning of the second half of that game." 
The Irish finished the season 27-6, the third most victories in school history, won the presea­son WNIT tournament and fin­ished second in the Big East conference. 
They return three starters next season. But next year's 
team will have the tough task of replacing graduating seniors Jacquelinf,l Batteast, a third team Associated Press All­American, who led the Irish in scoring with 16.9 points per game, and Teresa Borton, who never missed a game in her four years. 
"It's really going to be hard to replace them because they scored and rebounded," McGraw said. "Jackie, we want­ed her to have the ball in every clutch situation, so we're going to have somebody else to do that." 
First in line was freshman Charel Allen, named to the Big East all-freshman team this season. However, Allen suffered a torn ACL and MCL in her left knee and will have surgery in about a month once the MCL heals, McGraw said. Allen is expected to return for practice in October. 
"She should be ready for practice," McGraw said. "We don't expect her to be 100 per­cent, but she'll be cleared to play. 
"Cham! was going to step up and maybe be our go-to scorer next year, even as a sopho­more." 
While Allen should give the Irish a scorer, junior point guard Megan Duffy will return as the team's leader and heart and soul. The gutsy guard was named honorable mention Associated Press All-American

BASEBALL 
Tean1 takes road trip to Rutgers 
By TOM DORWART Sports Writer 
If the Irish baseball team seems bitter this week, it's because they're focused. If they seem a bit jumpy in classes, it's because they've got something else on their minds. 
Notre Dame (13-10)-win­ner of four straight -takes on longtime Big East rival Hutgers (13-9) in a noon doubleheader Saturday and a single game at noon Sunday in conference action at Rutgers' Class of '53 Baseball Complex. 
"It's hard for me to even say the name Hutgers," coach Paul Mainieri said. "When it's the week that you play Hutgers, there's a little extra bounce in the step, a little extra fire in the heart to go play," 
The last time Notre Dame traveled to Piscataway, N.J. to face the Scarlet Knights-dur­ing the 2003 season -the Irish dropped the final two games of the three-game series, drop­ping behind the Knights for first place in the Big East and ending any hope of contending for the top seed in the Big East tournament. 
In the final game, the Irish

Corey Mays turns heads when he walks into a room. His thick, bouncy, dread­locked hair tends to stand out. But entering his last season in an Irish uniform, the senior linebacker hopes to attract attention from his play alone. 
''I'm trying to do more this year with action," Mays said. "Because I believe peo­ple believe in someone who's doing more action rather than just talking. Really, I'm trying to combine talking and action to get the guys emotionally charged during practice." 
Mays and fellow senior Brandon Hoyte are the only

Irish travel to take on high scoring Big Green 
By MIKE GILLOON Sports Writer 

Notre Dame has already played three Inside Lacrosse top 20 teams this season, but its most difficult test might come Saturday when the No. 6 Irish travel to Hanover, N.H. to take on No. 17 Dartmouth. 
The latest NCAA statistics rank Notre Dame first in the nation in scoring with 12.8 goals per game. But Dartmouth has the 12th-ranked scoring defense in the nation, and Irish coach Kevin Corrigan expe~ts a stiff challenge. 
"Defensively, they're very ath­letic and very aggressive," Corrigan said. "When you look at their scores on the year, they've done a really nice job. 
They haven't given up the shots they don't want to give up because they have an excellent goalie Lin Ivy League player of the week Andrew Goldstein]. 
"Offensively, they've got some very good players. They don't have the depth that some peo­ple have, but the guys that they have in the midfield and attack are very good players." 
That defense will be tested by the quick-striking Notre Dame offen~e. Junior attack Pat Walsh leads the Irish with 14 goals and 17 assists. 
"Pat is an outstanding play­er," Corrigan said. "I give him all the credit this year. He's played extremely well. But I think a lot of credit has to go to the guys that are playing
