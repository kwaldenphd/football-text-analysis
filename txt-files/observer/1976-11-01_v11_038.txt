Presidential race still too close to call, 
according to 
by Gregg B. Bangs Political Editor 

According to the results of several final national surveys, the race for the Presidency between Republican incumbant Gerald Ford and Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter is a virtual toss-up. 
A New York Times-CBS survey published Saturday night said Car­ter was ahead, but that his margin was within the 2.5 per cent margin of error--which means that Ford could be the leader. The Times did not release figures on overall Ford and Carter Support. 
A poll conducted by Louis Harris for ABC News found Carter leading Ford by just one percentage point. 45 per cent to 44 per cent. Jn six states that are considered crucial, the candidate's own polls showed them only a percentage point or two apart, according to a R. W. Apple Jr. story that appeared in the Oct. 31 New York Times. Apple found political tacticians in both camps "agreed that the election was poised on a knife edge, and analysts across the country were unwilling to hazard predictions." 
Even such high ranking Demo­crats as Robert S. Strauss, the Democratic National Chairman, admits the President has a chance for victory. "There is now a real possibility that Ford could win,'' he said. "But it's hard to make a three-horse parlay, and that's what the President needs--all the close ones. I'd still bet on Carter, although I wouldn't bet the family farm." 
Carter still ahead In Electoral Votes 
An interim New York Times tabulation found Carter presently leading Ford in electoral votes, 253 to 188, with 97 still too close to call. A candidate needs 270 electoral votes to win. 

On The Inside 
various national surveys 
The Times also revealed it had received a document from sources "close" to the President Ford Committeee. This document gave Carter the lead in electoral votes, 230 to 196, leaving 112 votes in a category labeled as "pivotal." The document unexpectedly conceded that Carter would probably take New York and Texas, while main­taining that Ford could still carry Florida. 
"Route 80 States" Crucial 
Apple maintains states lying along Interstate Route 80 between New York and Chicago will probab­ly be a key to the outcome of Tuesday's election. 
In New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, the race is close. Carter supporters are most confident about Ohio and Pennsylvania and Republicans are most confident about Indiana, New Jersey and Illinois, ·respectively. The race in 111inois is extremely close, according to the final Chi­cago Sun-Times poll. The poll shows Carter leading Ford by one-tenth of one percentage poing, 
49.4 per cent to 49.3 per cent. 
According to a Newsday-Gannett newspapers poll completed this past Thursday, Carter leads Ford by three percentage points in New York. The former Georgia gover­nor is also considered safely ahead in Massachusetts, Florida, an Texas, where he campaigned heav­ily this weekend. 
Ford is ahead of Cartet in his home state of Michigan, as well as in California, where a Field Poll shows the former Michigan con­gressman ahead of his Democratic foe bv six points. 
The Times maintains that since Carter is still strong in both the South and the Border states, Ford ''probably needs three or f~ur of the Route 80 states to wm, a si7eable requirement, but one htat no longer seems beyond his reach." 
Last Minute Campaigning 
Carter and Mondale are both campaigning heavily up until Mon­day night. Carter travelled to the West Coast last night to appear in a telethon with Gov. Edmund Brown and Representative Barbara Jordan of Texas. The telethon will be shown in California, Oregon, Nev­ada and Washington; states whee the race is close. 
Mondale made his eleventh ap­pearence in Ohio, over the week­end to build on what is blieved to be a small Carter lead. In a high!· unorthodox, Carter and Monda! will close out their campaig1. tonight in Detroit, Michigan; the same day Ford concludes his campaign with appearences in Detroit and Grand Rapids, his home town. 

Roemer requests students refrain from passing up females at games 
by Marian Ulicny Staff Reporter 
James A. Roemer, dean of students, has appealed to the University community as a whole to stop passing female students in the stands during football games. 
According to. Roemer, his office has been "the recipient of many complaints from women who felt it was an extremely humiliating experience." 
Roemer states he would like to see an end to ''this ridiculous practice" because of the danger of potential injury to both the women passed up and the students doing the passing. He cited the example of a student who had to be taken to St. Joseph Hospital for X-rays after a woman being passed up fell and injured him. 
In addition to facing possible injury, the women are subjected to embarrassment, Roemer noted. He stated there is an obvious differ­

Roemer stated he does not want

comfortable with threats," he sl'id. 
"Exhortation alone is not the 
answer.'' 

According to Roemer, it is the women themselves who will prolong or eliminate the passing-up . situation. "1 would hope that the women in the community w mid let the men know how they fed about this ridiculous practice," Roemer 
stated. 
He added, "I don't think the 
women have voiced their opinions 
in a strong enough way. H they 
would, there's enough men who 
would recognize the problem and idea of it is frightening, so you fight a lot," Mara Quinn stated. "After it's done, you don't want it to happen again," she added. Sue Barry agreed that "it was really scarey. It wasn't fun at all." Another girl described being pas­sed up as "disgusting and dehu­manizing." . 
Some girls felt they were passed up because their friends initiated it as a joke. "Most often it's your friends," noted Elaine Glaid. "If you don't talk to the guys around, you're not as apt to get passed up." Barry disagreed, stating, "They were grabbing anyone in our immediate vicinity. I didn't know anyone who picked me up." 
The girls agreed that avoiding being passed interfered with their attention to the football game. "I couldn't even concentrate on the game," Quinn stated. Barry added, "We couldn't even sit in our seats for the rest of the game because we were . afraid it

Floridian turns his house 
into 'creative nightmare' 
MIRAMAR, Fla.(AP) -A dis­membered body, a guillotine over a screaming head, rain, thunder and lightning, cobwebs, and Franken­stein are surprises for the trick-or­treater arricing at Bill Schuck's house. 
Schuck, who calls himself"the Devil's Advocate," turned his par­ent's quiet residential home into an intricate jorror fantasy and he opened it up to hundreds of children -for free. 
··welcome to my creative night­mare.·· said Schuck, who turned 19 on Halloween Eve. The bearded Schuck. his hair dusted with gray coloring. wears a cape, ruffled shirt and other clothes reminiscent of garb worn in horror movies. 
He jas converted the front yard into a weedy cemetery with real tombstones imported from West Virginia. Hidden sprinklers pro­vide rain, strobe lights flash light­ning and a tape recorder emits thunder. 
A woman's head whispers ghoul­ish epithets from within a crystal ball -the result of a continuous tape player-movie projector under the table. Mirrors and lights combine to suggest ghosts and dis­membered bodies. A real human skeleton rests in a black coffin. Fifteen life-like statues of charac-­ters ranging from Frankenstein to Regan of the "Exorcist" are in the 
border patrol police, special forces units and troops of the Thai army's 
3rd  division.  Searches  of  Viet­ 
namese  homes  are  every  day  
occurrences.  

With more than 4,000 to 5,000 old-time Vietnamese residents and 16,000 refugees from Communist­governed Laos across the Mekong River from here, the area is considered by Thai authorities a potential hotbed of Communist subversion. 
There is another reason for increased police and army surveil­ance in Nong Khai, a Mekong River crossing point into Laos. The provincial governor says that more than 300 leftist Thai students, polit\cians and Vietnamese subver­sives have fled to Laos since the military took power in Thailand in a coup 0ct. 6. 
Some Thais and Vietnamese confided that a few of their friends had crossed the half-mile-wide Mekong since the military seized power and began a sweep of what it considers potential subversives. 
"I was sitting in my house. Suddenly three policemen came in and began searching through every room," said the Vietnamese pri­soner, Tran Van Linh, in an interview in jail. "They took portraits of Ho Chi Minh from the wall and private correspondence with friends of mine in Hanoi. Of course I have friends in Vietnam, but I'm not a subversive." 
Linh, a merchant who has lived in Thailand for 19 years, said he is ready to return to Vietnam if Hanoi and Bangkok reached an agree-

A gift to the University will be used to endow a Memorial Library collection to further Judaic studies within the Department of Theol­ogy. 
The gift, presented by Edward Ab, ams, a 1950 Notre Dame grad­uate, will be used to establish the Alfred R. and Lee Abrams Collec­tion of Hebrew and Jewish Studies, in honor of his mother and his father, Alfred R. Abrams, a 1921 Notre Dame alumnus . 
Fr. Hesburgh, in expressing his gratitude to Mr. Abrams, said the endowment will allow the Univer­ment. 
Thailand's Vietnamese minority, living chiefly in the northeast and numbering some 60,000, has been a source of tension between Viet­nam and Thailand since the early 1950's, when thousands fled their homeland in the wake of the French-Indochina war. 
Numerous efforts at repatriation have proven fruitless. With the growth of Thailand's Communist insurgency, the economically influ­ential Vietnamese community has been regarded by many as a breeding ground for guerrillas and a channel for Hanoi's support of the rebellion. 
One of the first announcements of the new government was to accuse ''Vietnamese Communists'' of agitating student demonstra­tions in Bangkok which led to bloody street fighting Oct. 6. 
Official Vietnamese media res­ponded with propaganda blasts at Bangkok, accusing the new regime of persecuting the Vietnamese minority.

Carter and Ford view drugs 
by William S. Nichols Asst. Features Editor 

A sharp difference of opmtons about drug enforcement and illeg­ality mark the campaign promised of Gerald Ford and his challenger, Jimmy Carter. 
While Gerald Ford urges stron­ger legal penalties for dealers and lessened sentences for users, re­presentatives from the Carter camp have been meeting with represen­tatives from NORML, a marijuana decriminalization organization. 
There are speculations that Dr. Peter G. Bourne, a noted radical psychiatrist will be named as director of the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) if Carter is elected. President Ford has favored a strengthening of the DEA through a budget increase and an increase in agents. He is not considering replacing current director, Peter G. Bensinger. 
Bourne was one of the founders of the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, and did early drug-addic­tion research at the Haight-Ash­bury Free Clinic. He was the chief health and mental health advisor for Georgia during Carter's term as governor, and developed the state' first drug-abuse program. He has come out publicly for the complete decrimimltzation of mari­juana and a revamping of current drug treatment programs. He said that he had "mixed feelings"about the DEA and its role in enforce­ment. 
Carter has also personally en­dorsed decriminalization of mari­juana, but believes that the indivi­dual states should decide the legality of tlte drug. 
On the other side, President Ford is against the decriminiliza­tion of marijuana, stating that decriminalization will lead to a greater use of the drug. He does favor lessening penalties for simple possession to a maximum of 30 days. However, he also favors mandatory sentences from three to thirty years for all drug smugglers and sellers. 
Representatives of the Ford campaign stated that "there is no difference between marijuana and hard drug pushers to us." Ford is also urging a larger increase in the DEA budget for 1977-78, both for an increase of field agents and for a !!ystem of community treatment centers for hard drug addicts. He wants a review of the DEA made during the upcoming year but is satisfied with the performance of the current director Bensinger. 
The agency has been under fire recently both from Congress and from the press. Indiana Senator, Birch Bayh, confronted the DEA director about a proposed Federal Law aimed at heroin · trafficers, but possibly applicable to small time pot dealers and users. Stating "We're talking about decriminali­zation that would stop making criminals of our youth," Bayh badgered Bensinger about results from current testing that says that marijuana is relatively safe. Bayh also questioned the civil rights of tough anti-heroin measrues when used against marijuana smokers. 
Another Senate committee re­cently confirmed that the CIA plays a major role in th intelligence gathering operations of the DEA and that the DEA uses large amounts of Federal funds for buying drugs in the hopes of entrapping some major operatives in international smuggling opera­tions. According to Senator Sam Nunn, acting chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on investigations, "the activities of the DEA could operationally esta­blish a national pollee force. '

Recovery of Phoenix jet hampered by gale winds 
LONDON -A U.S. Navy team conquered gale winds and heaving seas yesterday to retrieve a Phoenix missile that fell from an aircraft carrier six weeks ago and plunged to the bottom of the Atlantic off Scotland. 
The rough weather prevented raising the F14 Tomcat jet fighter that sank with the highly classified missile off the aircraft carrier John 
F. Kennedy on Sept. 14, the Navy reported. It will be attempted when the sea calms. 
Discovery of the jet 10 days ago and Sunday's recovery of the Phoenix put an end to fears, minimized by the Navy, that Soviet ships might snatch the $20 million plane and $515,000 missile. 
The missile had a nonnuclear warhead but capture of a Phoenix and F14 would have provided technical data to a potential adver­sary. 
''The important thing is we got it and nobody else has it," a Navy spokesman said. He reported the missile was "intact with only light damage'' but it was too early to tell if it could be made useable. 
The Phoenix-equipped Tomcat is one of the Navy's major weapons against missiles and planes. 
A small nuclear submarine with a television camera and five crew­men located the 13-foot-long, 15­inch diameter missile Saturday morning after a search of the muddy bottom that one officer likened to trying to find a needle in a haystack the size of London's 341-acre Hyde Park. 
.Jhe sub, equipped with port­holes so the crew could observe the 1,900-foot-deep ocean floor, ex­tended a remote control arm and grasped the missile in a clam-shell like hand. 
Navy divers descended into the icy waters and 10-foot waves 75 miles northwest of Scapa Flow, Scotland and fixed straps to the missile. It was raised more than one-third of a mile to the surfacr and hoisted aboard the submarine support vessel Sunbird. 
The Phoenix is for use against antishlp missiles. An F14 can fire six at a time against separate targets up to 100 miles away. The system is reputed to be highly resistant to jamming. 
The sunken Tomcat, which plunged off the Kennedy's flight deck when engine controls mal­functioned during a North Atlantic Treaty Organization maneuver, rests in about 1,500 feet of water about three miles from where the missile was pulled up.

Albums 
live At CBGB's 

Dominick Salemi 

Yeah, I know we're going broke and 
everyone's moving out on us and we were 
just humiliated by the Reds in the Series 
and just lost the greatest entertainer in 
show business in Dr. J. 
That don't mean nothin'. We've still got 
Lou Reed, the Ramones, and CBGB's, 
where the best rock and roll in the world is 
currently being played. No matter how big 
Arrowsmith is I'd match Tuff Darts or 
Mink Deville with them anyday. Who need 
Stephen Tyler's histrionic Mick Jagger 
impersoantions when Mink sounds more 
like Jagger than Jagger himself. One 
thing's for sure; the people at CBGB's 
won't need reviews from Rolling Stone of 
Creem to tell everyone how good this Ip is; 
one listen is all anyone will need. 
CBGB's would be the Ip of the year but 
Lou's just released Rock and RoU Heart so I 
guess the people at Atlantic and CBGB's 
are going to have to settle for second best. 
Then agian the Ramones lp was such a 
killer that maybe this should be considered 
the third best release of the year. 
Anyway you look at it though, all three 
albums are indispensable thus making all 
distinctions unnecessary. Does anyone 
differentiate between Beethoven's nine 
symphonies? No, if you're at all cultured 
you buy all of them, as well as the violin 
concertos and the piano sonatas. 
Leaving aesthetic theory aside for the moment. I should explain to those of you who live outside the Big Apple that CBGB is a small bar on the lower east side of New York. The Bowery to be exact. Once a hang out for alcoholics, muggers, rapers, and other assorted deviates, it was purchased by one Hilly Krista! who decided to turn it over to local talent for bigger bucks and a better clientele. The change from a Bowery bar to an under­ground club didn't req:.Jire much costly renovation, only the addition of a small wooden platform at one end of the room. 
The closing of Max's Kansas City in the early 70's, which also served as a forum for indigenous talent, helped turn CBGB into the biggest undergound club in New York City. The resurgence of this scene was due in part to Kristal's gamble in letting unknown bands play the club as well as his audience's willingness to listen to them. Soon it became hip to be seen at the bar, and when the place started gettng heavy media coverage from the local papers, the rock magazines picked up on it and gave it the national exposure it needed. 
The underground Kenatssance was tinal­ly made available to hungry listeners earlier this year when the Ramones became the first group to land a record contract. The critical success of their first Ip found almost every major label . in pursuit of popular New York band.s, wtth Television and Talking Heads parttcularly sought after. 
Despite the absence of the more popular acts, as well as the two premier groups already mentioned, Live at CBGB's is the 

Mouies 
When we first see Alexander Main (Jack Lemmon), he is putting out his garbage. It is somehow fitting, for in that simplistic ritual is contained the sum total of his life. He is the product of his own creation, a chronic complainer who doesn't wallow in self-pity only becuase he fears the quag­mire will pull him in deeper. 
He is at his best when insulting his bookkeeper or recounting the glories of habeas corpus. He is a loner who alienates and abuses almost everyone he knows for his own amusement. And it is for this reason, the film would have us believe, that he falls in love with Maritza (Gene­vieve Bujold). It is because he i s really a very lonely middle-aged bailbondsman looking for a hand to hold and a spirit ~o cherish in a cruel and unsympathetic world. 
From the very beginning, the story 
doesn't work. Neither Main nor the gypsy seem capable of love; their relationship is more a matter of honor amongst theives. They are a couple of hustlers who stay together not because ' each represents something the other dearly needs (osten­sibly, security for her and ''the gypsy in his soul" for him). It is because misery loves company. And if they live i~ a .cr';'el, unfeeling world, they are not tts vtcbms but its leading citizens. . 
Director John Korty daesn't bother to . 
explore ·the motives and 'emotions (what".­
pure embodiment of the spirit of rock and roll, combining infectious enthusiasm, passionate intensity, a sense of drama, and stylistic panache. Besides, it is the 9nly shot at fame for most of these groups so they're giving it all they've got. 
Though many of the groups represented here are simplistic and often very deriva­entire reper .. 'ire ' songs on this albmu.; bands with little or no commercilil potentia., playing merely for kicks and beer money. Some of the other groups haven't been signe~ to record contracts but at le~tst are included in Punk's listing of the Top Ten Underground Ba, ds. 
Not much of a claim to fame I grant you 

tive, they are never boring. Sun for example, clearly pattern themselves after Led Zepplin, Nikki Buzz's feral growls and the almost frantic, scattered style of lead-guitarist Randy Fredeux recall Page and Plant. Yet their "Romance" is infinitely better than anything on the lackluster Presence or the stillborn "live" lp. 
Manster has its roots tirmly entrencneo in middle 60's :Bdtish rock. Their inane version of the Yardbirds' "Over, Under Sideways, Down," however is not' a cover but an illustration of the effects of speed on the central nervouw system. Vocalist Warren Stahurski is reduced to a scream­ing maniac as a result of ~ ~lazing interchange between the two gmtartsts. 
The innocuous Stuart's Hammer demon­. strates an intelligent sense of humor. when 
thev declare that they are gomg to 
throw "morality over their shoulder," and 
then proceed to do just that with a 
decadent imitation of the Grass Roots. 
The.~e 'tre only the minor groups, whose but at least local recognition. 
Tuff Darts is a moronic name for a group that excells in unpretentious and somewhat restrained rock and roll. They combine late 60's British rock (notably Bowie and the later-day Stones), with a highly polished sound. The three selections on this lp are all perfect examples of their musical approach. "All For Love," which kicks off the lp is an inspiring rock anthem, a commitment to the power and pasion of rock arid roll. "Head Over Heels," takes a cliched riff and adds decadent attitudes to produce an infectious paean to adolescent defiance. "Slash," a toned down version of Bowie's "Cracked Actor," is a sleazy love song that brilliantly depicts the rancor that develops in relationships that lack purposeful communication: 
I'd rather slash my wrists 
And cut my throat Than have to spend the night with you 
Your fancies are the pits 
You must be one sick bitch 
To want to do what you say you do 
Alex and the Gypsy 
little there are) of his characters. When Marita leaves Alex, we are given no indication why. Korty probably relies on his audience to pick up on the gypsy thing and come up with some excuse. But that is just the problem with this film; it is recklessly thrown together in the hope that the audience will cling to and relate with some small shred of either character's personality. The strategy fails, and with it the film, because they are a couple of malcontents who deserve each other and no more. 
We learn about the prior relationship through a series af poorly-constructed and ill-timed flashbacks. What the movie deals with directly is their reunion six years later that comes about when Maritza calls Alex to bail her out of jail. It seems she stabbed her husband in bed, which comes as no great surprise. 
In any event, the two spend a blissful four days sharing sex and hateful, Maritza handcuffed to the bed:She has become an investment, one that Main's bail bond business can't afford to lose should she decide to skip town again. 
But in the end, Main's mind succumbs to his emotion and he sets her free, like some wild animal that will die in captivity. He 


wavers to her as she flies off into the sun, vowing to follow her to Mazitlan and wherever her gypsy spirit takes her. One · can only wish it tyakes them both far, far 
It's hard to believe especially in the face 
of Ivrical brilliance like that, there could 
possibly exist a better group than Tuff 
Darts. Well there isn't one but lead singer 
Mink Deville of the group with the same 
nom de guerre, has the most talent. It is 
publically admitted that Mink has the 
finest set of pipes in all the NY. and 
although his band confesses that they 
are oDJy a oackdrop for Mink's continual 
impersonations of Mick Jagger, they 
provide more· than adequate support. A 
very fine songwriter as well, Mink's 
compositions are both intelligent and 
evocative, a quality that is hard to come by 
on the CBGB scene. Most of his songs are 
strongly flavored with elements of r&b and 
reggae 

But they are not merely derivative 
imitations as one critic has suggested. 
"Cadillac Moon," i', a sensitive ballad that 
is moving because of the insistence of the 
singer that he will someday achieve 
success in the face of the suffering and 
pain he has experienced. Yet by the song's 
end we are forced to realize that the singer 
has missed his chance and there is now 
nothing left for him but dreams. symbo­
lized in his vision of the Cadillac moon. 
"Change It Comes," one of the other 
two cuts by Mink on the lp is a dynamic 
reggae number. It visualizes a time in the 
not too distant future when men can live 
together as brothers; a cliched sentiment 
that is belied by the calliope-like quality of 
a Fender Rhodes, a haunting reminder of 
lost innocence and the "change" that will 
probably never come. 
The Shirts are another group with a talented lead singer in Annie Golden but they are also an instrumentally sound band as well. If you thought that Kiss was al that Brooklyn had to offer in terms of musical sophistication and style you had better guess again stooge because "da Shoits," as they call themselves, are gonna turn your head around. They combine interesting rhythms and affecting melodies and sound something like the Doors if they had. had a female singer. "Operetico," one of ,their three compositions on the album, would be the single of the year if they could raise the funds to release it. A strongly sycopated beat, an ethereal melody and the use of dual leads are utilized to create a frenzied clamorous backdrop over which the vocals are passionately sung. 
It definitely appears as if New York has become the capital of the rock and roll world. With CBGB's providing the forum and Lou Reed and Patti Smith the inspiration, the underground scene has burgeoned into a Renaissance movement that has restored the vitality and purpose to an art form, that seemed to be in disastrous decline. 
I for one know rock and roll is still alive. I recently saw the Ramones at a small club in Washington and their thirty minute set did more to restore my confidnece in the power of rock and roll than anything I've heard in the past five years. 

Dauid O'Keefe 

he does his best to bring some semblance of credibility and dimension to his char­acter, but even his efforts are not enough to overcome the inherent problems of the movie. And in the end, Alell and the Gypsy is a squalid and predictable as the characters it depicts.

Carter's The One! 
It's time for a change. It's time to change a four-year non-policy of a political drift. Since Richard Nixon first began to use to the White House as a bunker to defend himself against Watergate charges, the Chief Executive has ceased to lead the nation. President Ford, while he is a sincere and honest man, has continued the non-leadership of his predecessor's final days.
Jimmy Carter, in his aggressive two­year campaign, has shown he is not satisfied with the country's current course and if elected he will provide active leadership which can, in John Kennedy's words, "get the country moving again." 
Many people have said in the course of this campaign that it does not matter who wins. Although neither man has been successful at getting his case across, there are differences between them. Granted, these are differences of degree. Still, they are substantial enough to justify voting for Carter. Consider the issues'; 
. The Economy: During the term of the man elected Tuesday, we students will be entering the job market. It is clear that Ford will continue the policies of the last two years, policies which according to the latest statistics, do not even achieve the slow recovery he aims for. Carter has shown more interest in the impact of our weak economy on individuals; He would have the government provide last-resort i>bs and use it's influence to spur the sagging economy. 
. Energy and the Environment; The effects of Ford's inactivity and "govern­ment by veto" are clearer here than anywhere else. Dependence on unreliable foreign oil sources continues to increase. Insofar as President Ford has an energy policy at all it is one of support for Big Oil. Carter on the other hand, favors strict government regulation of oil companies and independent development of new sources. Ford emphasizes nuclear energy as an alternative, whereas Carter prefers developing new non-nuclear sources. 
Carter, both in his record as governor of Georgia and in his campaign, has shown a sincere interest in preserving the environment. Ford has been willing to sacrifice the environment for ' alleged economic benefit as in his veto of the strip mining bill (a bill which had the support of 


A Little SomethingExtra 
Dear Editor: 

Relating to the University's policy on alcoholic beverages, I came across some interesting information in S.E. Morison's The 
InteUectual Life Of Coloalal New England, assigned to me in American History. Harvard Col­lege, the first institution of higher learning founde'd in American (1636), is documented to have

the United Mine Workers). . Health, Education and Welfare Refonn: Carter favors more federal government support for social justice programs in these areas. He wished to phase in a greatly needed national health insurance progrnm which Ford vehemently opposes on the grounds that it would reduce the quality of health care. Ford apparently has not noticed the current dismal quality of health care for millions of poor Americans. Ford has vetoed increased federal support for education while Carter would increase it, realizing America's future lies in its educated citizens. Although both candi­dates criticize the existing welfare struc­ture, Carter has promised a major overhaul geared toward jobs for those who can work, and a single payment for those who cannot. Ford has done nothing more for welfare reform than for anything else. 
Government Reorganization: Carter has made this a major issue. He reformed the Georgia beauracrary in his term as governor while, Ford in his two years as president, has done nothing about the federal reorganization. In fact, Ford started mentioning the subject only after Carter had been talking about it for over a year. . The Men Themselves: Both candidates have persuaded many voters that they are mediocre men. Certainly neither could be called a charismatic personality. But a competent leader need not be a flashy one. He must however be an active one. Ford has shown, not only in the White House, but throughout his entire political career, that he stands for drifting with the status quo. Not only will he not rock the boat, he will not steer it either. 
Admittedly, Carter is more of an unknown quantity. That can be said of any challenger running against an incumbent. But despite Ford's charges of vagueness, Carter has made his positions about as clear as positions of any candidates are. More importantly, perhaps, he represents a chance for dynamic leadership and is not satisfied with the status quo. Realizing that America can still become a much better nation, he is willing to take risks to make-it better. · 
The basic choice in this election is between four more years of drift or a new beginning~ America needs that new beginning. Carter is the best choice.

(A Puritan-founded school) God only knows how this "corrupt"· prac· tice was ever allowed to continue since the Puritan Church dis­dained the use of alcohol almost to the point of prohibition. Perhaps it lies in the fact that they were a "bearded" people; but Morison does not say, however, it defi­nitely was drunk openly and without pride, and although it may have been a little sour at times, I'd bet seven points on my next Emil that it was (burp!) good.

Seriously, Folks 

The Debates Are Cancelled 
~iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii~art buchwald 
HOLLYWOOD--The TV net­works are atarting to cancel their fall shows that didn't make it. One of the first to go will be the presidential debates. Television executives from all networks have decided the show just doesn't have enough interest to continue it through the rest of the year. 
They called in the TV agents for Jimmy Carter and President Ford. 
The programming director of CBS said,"We're sorry, boys, but the debates have to go.'' 
"But the ratings have been fantastic," Ford's agent protested. 
''They were good,'' a man from NBC said,"but-the problem is that in spite of the ratings we couldn't get a sponsor . Nobody .would buy it for a series." 
The ABC programming chief said. "It just wasn't playing in Peoria. People don't want to hear about unemployment, inflation and wheat embargoes. They want entertainment. We had hopes for this_show when we put it on the air, but we didn't know it was going to be so dQ__wnbeat." 
The Ford man said, "That wasn't our fault. Carter was the one who made the debates down­beat. He kept talking about what a mess the tax system was, how the poor and the old weren't getting anything out of the government and how the cities were being ignored by the Republicans. Ford was upbeat. He talked about the Fo4rth of July and how his Admin­istration had solved the economic and environmrntal problems of the country. Play the tapes back and you'll see that Ford made it a happy show, but Carter kept throw­ing cold water on it.'' t 
The Carter man said, "Oh yeah? All Ford kept doing during the debates was to spout a lot of figures that put half the country to sleep. Carter was the one who put life into the show and kept people on the edge of their sea~s.'' 
The CBS programming chief said, "There is no sense bla.ming each other. The format wasn't right to start with. You can't have two wooden men standing in front of two wooden barrels and saying the same thing week after week and expect to hold the audience." 
"We'll change the format," the Ford man said. "We'll build a new set and have Betty Ford and Rosalyn Carter living next door to each other. They'll be good friends and their husbands will always be getting into trouble like Jackie Gleason and Art Carney on the Honeymooners. 
The ABC man said, "Gerry Ford and Jimmy Carter are not Jackie Gleason and Art Carney.'' 
Carter's agent said,"We'll add the Carter kids and the Ford kids to the show. They could always be getting into fights with each other and Amy Carter could keep bug­ging Gerry Ford and driving him crazy like 'Dennis the Menace'''. 
Ford's agent said, "Well make Jack Ford into another 'Fonzi' and Susan' Ford could play a 'Laverne' character." 
The Carter man said, "Ford could be an Archie Bunker." 
"Wait a minute," the Ford man said. "The President is not going to be Archie Bunker. I think Jimmy Carter should play a character like Redd Fox on Sanfordand Son."· 
Carter's agent said, "You're out of your mind.'' 
The NBC programming chief said,"Were sorry, gentlemen. It just won't work. We can buy Betty and Rosalyn and the Ford and Carter kids. But Gerry and Jimmy are just not up to playing situation comedy. The show has to go.'' 
"But what do we tell our client~? They put everything they had in the debates." 
The CBS man said, "Tell them that we may have a show for the one who wins the presidential election." 
"What kind of a show?" 
"We'll let him do a press conference in the White House. But not on a regular basis.''

Hail Leviathan 

Dear Editor: 
"In America anyone can grow up to be President.'' Whoever is first accredited with that expression obviously never tried to run for this country's highest office as an independent candidate. Teddy · Roosev-elt tried it in 1912 and lost. George Wall ace tried it in 1968 and failed. The current Independent candidate for President, Eugene McCatthy, will no doubt meet a similar fate in the coming election. As those who have tried before him were painfully made aware, the most powerful monopoly in the United States is nut controlled by big business. but by this country's two major political parties. 
The D'emocratic and Republican parties are firmly established insti­tuti6ns. More than that, they have both succeeded in effectiv~y sup­pressing any kind of political competition outside their respect­
. ive arenas. Both Federal and State Government have evloved into a Leviathan structured to protect the interests of these two parties. The reason for this is that the name of the game is control. Any insti­tution that controls effectively has power. Fear gf losing control or giving up a part of it, is an obsession that afflicts dictatorships and democracies alike. To secure hegemony, 1t is necessary to devise a system of obstructions useful for warding off potential threats. All of it (of course) perfectly legal. How well does this system work? Very efficiently. One effective means of control in this country is our "nonpartisan" judicial pro­cess. Friday, October 22, 1976, the McCarthy campaign suffered a fatal setback in two separate court actions. The first was the decision by a New York State Supreme Court to remove McCarthy's name from the ballot. The order was given on technical' grounds that the candidate's nominating petitions were not in "proper form". Of course, it would be unthinkable to question the technical validity of the nominating petitions, or their signatures, for Jimmy Carter or Presiqent Ford. McCatrhy's eligi­bility was challenged because New York Democrats feared his candi­dacy might cost Carter the state's 
by Garry Trudeau 

41 electoral votes. 
The second blow was delivered by Chief Justice Warren Burger, who rejected McCarthy's petition to be included in the third presi­dential debate, or gain equal time in all three debates. Burger handed down his decision without any explaination. 
More important than the fact that a candidate's right to be heard was obstructed. The voter was denied a choice. It is not a question of whether or not McCarthy would make a good President. It is a matter of allowing the voters the opportunity to hear all sides, an_d determine for themselves who ts best qualified. 
·Deny a candidate equal access to the same channels of communica­tion used by his opponents, a~d his chances for election wi.JI become almost nil. The two court decisiQns have very effectively~ and very legally, insured what McCarthy's outcome in this election will be. As the final debate clearly revealed, nobody won -least of all the American people.

Proud, _but Not of Ford 
Dear Editor: 
I note with dismay the cam­
paign slogan of the President 
Ford Committee: "He's rriaking 
us feel proud again." The em­
phasis on "feel" is disturbing. Is 
the present administration foster­
ing in us illusory emotions, 
unsupported by accomplish­
ments? I believe so. 
I'm not proud of an administra­
tion which has done so little about 
unemployment at 7.8 percent, the 
declining ·rate of economic 

growth, and ri~ing inflation. I'm 
not proud of a president who 
makes light of totalitarian Com­
munist domihation of Eastern 
Europe and, under the guise of 

detente, furnishes the Soviet 
Union with war-supportive tech­
nology. I'm not proud of an 

administration which pushes for 
ever increasing defense budgets 
($112 billion!) in a tirue of 
"peace" but refuses to increase 

aid to education, housing, medi­
cal care, or environmental protec­
tion because these are "inflation­
ary." 
Please don't accuse me of 

being unpatriotic; I'm very proud 
of the United States, its ~ople, 
and its potential. But, I m not 
proud because of Gerald Ford.

Due to the large number of Notre Dame students registered in Indiana, extensive coverage was given to this state's guber­natorial and senatorial races as well as the election for the Third Congressional Dis­trict, which encomapasses Notre Dame. As a conclusion to this coverage we feel it is necessary to comment on the candidates and issues of these races. 
. Governor: Up until this year, an Indiana governor was legally barred from suc­ceeding himself. In the case of incumbant Otis "Doc" Bowen, we see no need to break from tradition. Bowen, in the same vein as Gerald· Ford, believes in the poilitics of the status quo. The result of this is ,generally mediocre record, particu­lary in the areas of public service and utilities. On the other hand, Democratic challenger Larr:' Conrad's strong economic stand·on the utilitl issue would result in using industry to help Indiana---instead of having the money filter out to other states. Perhaps most importantly to students, Conrad is also in favor of legislation which would lower the drinking age. We favor larry Conrad. 
. U.S. Senator: Incumbant Vance Hartke has managed to combine an ineffective career in the Senate and a reputation for supporting special interests. Most of his self-proclaimed hard work on legislation has come in the no-work position as co-sponsor. Republican challenger Rich­ard lllgar favors cutting high federal spending, but was responsible himself for high spending while he was mayor of Indianapolis. 

Their respective campaigns have been nothing better than low grade hack jobs. Both have charged each other with campaign spending violations, special interests for the job, to mention a few. Unfortuately, many of the charges re­garding both candidates' qualifications appear to be true. We offer no endorsement for either candidate. 
Third District Congressional Seat: In­cumbant John Brademas is the fourth­ranking Democrat in the House and has gotten there through hard work. His special area of concentration is education where his record has justly earned him Fr. Hesburgh's tag of "Mr. Education." Republican challenger and IUSB Politir.al Science Professor Thomas Thorsen has done nothing to distinguish himself in this campaign except to baselessly accuse Brademas of accepting illegal campaign rontributions. 
We support John Brademas.

"I think some guys would stop it, but I don't think the practice would stop. There would always be someone who would stilldo it." Another student felt that exces­sive discouragement from the wo­men might produce a reverse effect. "It might irritate the problem.

Missing daVinci believed hidden by fellow artist 
FLORENCE. Italy · Travers Newton has been spending his days rapping on a wall with his bare fist, hut he is confident his sore knuckles and some sophisticated sonar equipment will eventually locate a lost masterpiece by Leo­nardo da Vinci. 
Newton is part of. an American team which launched the search 10 days ago in the great council hall of the Florence municipal palace. 
Members of the team have already discovered that there is a brick wall behind a fresco by Giorgio Vasari, and they believe the wall was put up by the 16th century painter out of respect for a fellow artist whose work he dared not destroy. A small inscription in Vasari's painting· "Cerca, Trova" or seek and you will find · is a piece of "Renaissance humor" that helps convince them they are looking in the right spot for Leonardo's "Battle of Angiari." 
Leonardo began the work in JSOS under contract with the Republic of Florence but never finished it. Records of the time indicate the fragment was admired as one of his most important paintings and pre­served for up to SO years, despite a change in politics that destroyed the republic it glorified. 
Vasari was .given the job of remodeling the hall in 1S63 and the leonardo disappeared, either de­stroyed or preserved intact behind a special wall. 
.. J' d like to belie-ve the latter." savs Newton. 26. an art restoration expert from Los Angeles. , His knuckle rapping is to too~_ for hollow spaces and slaws in the Vasari. which must be treated to preserve it from harm during the search. 
Another believer is Prof. Carlo Pedretti. an art historian from the Universitv of California at Los Angeles ·and head of the search team. 
He notes that Vasari on several occasions built brick walls to pro­tect paintings he covered with his own works. 
Pedretti said there are also theorie:; that Leonardo's work died a natural death when the colors failed to hold because he was experimenting with a new oil-based technique rather than water color. 
Sign-ups for bus to Eagles concert 
The Student Union ticket office is still accepting sign-ups for the November 11 bus trip to Chicago Stadium for the Eagles concert. For further information call the Student Union at 77S7. 
Whatever the fate of the Leo­nardo, Pedretti promised at the ceremonies launching the search· on Oct. 21 that the techniques being used will show ''with certain­ty whether Vasari destroyed the painting of Leonardo or not." 
-Prof. John Asmus, a physicist from the University of California at San Diego, developed the sonar system being used as a non­destructive method of looking be­hind one painting to find another. 
Sound ~aves .reflected through the wall of the search area allow the experts to determine the materials in all its lavers. 
Newton says it would be simpler and less costly to cut a hole in the Vasari, which could be replaced later, and look behind it. 
"But no one is abJe·or willing to give us permission to do this," he said. 
The sonar device is the safest method available to look for the Leonardo without jeopardizing the Vasari painting, but it is going ~o take time and money. Newton ts afraid of running out of both. 
Shipping clerk charged with two ·murders in shooting spree 
MECHANIOVILLE, N.Y. · A 
shipping clerk was charged with 
two counts of second degree mur­
der yesterday after a police officer 
and a bar patron were killed and 
nine other persons wounded by 
gunfire sprayed from an apartment 
building here, police report. 
Police said Kenyon W. Pruyn, 
32, who police said was employed 
at a plant in nearby Latham, N.Y., 
was taken into custody late Satur­
day when he emerged from the 
burning apartment building. 
Officers said he fired more than 
300 rounds during the shoot-out, 
which lasted nearly two hours. 
Pruyn allegedly fired out of the 
window of his third floor apart· 
ment, located near the police 
station on Main Street in this town 
of about 6,200 persons in central 
New York State. The alleged 
gunman fired into the roadway and 
into a tavern across the street, 
where most of the wounded were 
seated. 
Police said nine weapons · rifles 
and shotguns · were found in the 
apartment. Pruyn's wife and two 
daughters were not at home at the 
time. 
About SO police officers, includ­
ing state police, helped to cordon 
off the area during the shooting 
spree. Police returned fire sporad­
ically, unable to get a clear line of 
fire. 
The alleged gunman left the 
building after a fire started. Police 
believe it may have been caused by 
gunfire igniting a gas stove in 
Pruyn's apartment. 
Police said that Pruyn. a former 
marine, had been having family 
problems Friday and had been 
drinking. Officers also said he had 
been stopped for a speeding viola· 
tion by local police earlier Satur-
Ethnic enrollment at same level 
Ethnic minority student enroll­ment at the University this semes­ter continued at the same level as in previous years with the additon of 106 students, one Jess than last year's record of 107 new students. The 106 students represent six per cent of the new members of the student body. 
The new students include SO Spanish Americans, 34 blacks and 10 Oriental Americans. Twelve of the students transferred from other schools while 94 are entering Notre Dame as freshmen. 
day. 
When Pruyn emerged from the building, 21-year-old, part-time of-fleer Paul Luther, a bachelor, lay dead at the entrance to the tavern, Joyce's Log Cabin. 
James Marsh, SO, who was wounded while in the bar, died a short time later at an area hospital. 
Luther, a part-time officer since June, had taken an exam earlier in the day in hopes of becoming a full-time policeman. 
Six of the nine wounded, includ­ing police officer John L. Gonnelly, 3S, were in satisfactory condition at area hospitals Sunday. The other 
three were in fair condition. 
Gonnelly and Luther were the first officers at the scene, respond­ing to ~he sound of gunfire and the tavern s burglar alarm. 
The two officers arrived in 
separate police vehicles and appar· ently were hit almost immediately after arriving at the tavern. 
Police said that Pruyn later moved from the front to the back of his apartment in the Kennedy Gardens Apartments, firing to keep police officers from moving. in on 
him. 
The man was taken in a State Police car to the nearby Malta barracks and then to Saratoga Hospital for treatment of facial cuts, apparently caused by flying 
glass.

leers split weekend series with MSU 
[Continued from page 12) 
rally was rudely interrupted when 
Spartan forward Joe Campbell 
stole the puck from Don Fairholm 
in the corner of the Irish zone, 
skated to the crease and shoveled 
the puck past Moher for an 
unassisted and shorthanded goal 
with a 3-2 State lead. 
From that point on, it was all 
Irish. Seemingly insulted by 
Campbell's affrontery, Moher per­
formed brilliantly for the remainder 
of the game with solid support from 
his defensemen. But the most 
inspired play came from the offen­
se as they combined relentless fore 
checking and slick skating and stick 
handling to batter the hapless 
Versical for five more goals. 
Walsh's second goal on a slaps­
shot from the point that somehow 
found its way through a maze of 
sticks and legs to the net, made it 
3-3. Sophomore Steve Schneider 
scored the go-ahead tally on 
assists from Ray Johnwon and Paul 
clark to close out the second period. 
Don Fairholm kept the surge going 
into the final frame when he took a 
beautiful pass from brother Terry, 
danced around two Spartan de­
fenders and fired a 15-foot wrist 
shot that beat Versical high to the 
left. At 12:42 Paul Clark made it 
6-3, rifling home a slapshot . And 
the Duke added insult to injury 
with this thrid goal of the night 
hammering a slow rolling puck 
from in front of the net for the Irish 
co-captain's fifth career hat trick. 
The Irish not only outplayed Michigan State in the last two periods but also managed to stay a out of trouble, being penalized only twice after the sinful first period. "I felt that our kids improved period by period," commented Coach Smith after the game. "We started to move the puck better and capitalize on opportunities as the game wore on." Smith was also encouraged by the performances of his freshmen, who demonstrated a lot of maturity in their first collegi­ate contest. But he was neverthe­less cautious about the opening victory. "One game doesn't make a weekend," he warned. 
Indeed. 
The following night found Clark Hamilton back in the lineup and John Peterson making his initial start in the nets. Again the game got off to a slow start, but this time it was the Irish who scored first when freshman Greg Meredith tipped a Brownschidle slapshot past Versical to give the Irish the lead at 15:36 mark. 
Two short minutes later, how­
ever, Spartan forward Russ Welch 
capitalized on a breakdown in the 
Notre Dame defense when he took 
a pass from Jeff Brubaker at the 
ND blueline, skated unmolested on John Peterson and flipped a wrist shot past to make it 1-1. The Spartans took the lead with 4 seconds left in the epriod when Jeff Addley fired a 20-foot slapper past the screened Peterson. 
The Irish came out flaming in the second period, setting the house on fire with four goals in as many to take a S-2 lead. Terry Fairholm opened the floodgates with 23 seconds gone, taking Kevin Nu­gent's pass in front of Versical and slipping it past his gloveside into the net. Donny Fairholm .followed his brother's suit 43 seconds later with his first of two goals, faking Versical out of position and lifting backhander into the -cords. Ted W eltzin took a turn igniting the red light after Meredith battled the puck from the Spartans and fed his fellow freshman in front of the goal. The roar of the crowd for Weltzin's score was still echoing in the far reaches of the dome when Donny Fairholm took the puck at his own blue line, skated in between, around and past the MSU defense and shoved a backhander past the shell-shocked Versical for a 5-2 lead. 
The frustrated Spartans reacted to the Notre Dame assault with a physical attack of their own. The Irish responded in kind and both teams were slapped with five minor penalties in the period. It was while Roger Bourque was serving time in the box that Michigan State scored their tally of the period, a Kevin Coughlin wrister over a prone Peterson, who had just stopped three point-blank shots but was unable to reach the puck before the Spartan left wing. 
Despite that goal, however, the 3,826 Irish partisans buoyed by the awesome offensive surge they had witnessed earlier, seemed to feel that the 5-3 lead would be enough 'to insure a victory and sweep for the obviously superior Irish. But no one told Michigan State. 
The high sticks and elbows continued to fly in the third period. At one point, Notre Dame was forced to play at a two-man disadvantage when both Duke Walsh and Don Jackson were whistled off for infractions. Brown­schidle, Don Fairholm and Dick How killed the penalties brilliantly, but the Irish had been forced to go on the defensive and as a result had lost their momentum. "Those pen­alties really hurt," said Smith later. "They broke all our contin­uity and ruined the flow of the game." 
Not for State, however. Russ Welch made it 5-4 when the Irish were unable to control the puck in their own zone. Moments later, with both teams two men short due to penalties, Ted Huesing floated a soft backhander over Peterson' Brian Walsh [left] scored three goals Friday and the WCHA season opener last weekend.

shoulder to knot the score at 5 with 
as many minutes left in the gart:Je. 
It was at this point that it seemed that neither team would win. The Irish offensive could not get un­tracked all period while the Spartan skaters had been having trouble all weekend, the majority of their goals coming on defensive collap­ses bv the Irish. 
So ·it was only appropriate that the winning score should come on such a breakdown. And it did,when MSU forwards Coughlin and Joe Johnson came in on lone defender Jack Brownschidle. Brownschidle dio what he was supposed to, staggering the two invaders and going after the man with the pu~k in order to force the play. Coughn passed to Johnson and Peterson was ready, but Johnson's weak roller crawled between his legs for the winning score at 16:31. The verdict was cemented at 18:57 when a Walsh pass from the corner of his own zone hit the surprised Peterson in the leg and bounced into the net, emptying the stands and making the final 7-5. 
It was, simply and fairly, poor display by the Irish. It wouldn't here been so bad if they hadn't been so good the night before. "We're extremely disappointed, to say the least,'' said Smith after the game. "The thing that hurts the most is that when you look back you see all their goals were scored against our veterans." 
Donny Fairholm played superbly both nights, offensively (four goals and an assist) as well as defensive­ly. It is in individual performances like Fairholm's as well as in the solid play of his freshman new­comers that Smith can find encour­agement.

Irish barely squeak by Navy 27-21 
l 
I J 
... 
by Fred Herbst Sports Editor 

ClEVELAND-It's hard to believe, but Navy came close to beating Notre Dame Saturday. In fact. they came within a fingertip of pulling off what would have been one of the most shocking upsets of the season before dropping a 27-21 decision to the Irish. 
The fingertip belonged to Irish freshman Dave Waymer who with 
4:47 remaining in the contest and Notre Dame desperately clinging to a six point lead, made a diving fingertip deflection of a Navy pass at the Irish two-yard line to prevent a Middie touchdown and secure the Notre Dame win. 
After driving his team 64 yards to the Notre Dame 16. Navy quarterback Bob Leszczynski fired a fourth-and-two pass toward split end Steve Scott that could have given the Midshipmen a victory if it weren't for Waymer's play. 
"That was a touchdown," Navy Coach George Welsh said. "I thought we had a touchdown. Waymer deflected it with a finger­tip, a heckuva play." 
"I just let him (Scott) drift across the middle," Waymer explained," "and when I saw the ball coming I knew I had to dive." 
Waymer's effort was certainly the key play in staving off the upset-minded Middies, but it didn't finish them. Navy got the ball back with I:SO remaining at their 16. With Leszczynski throw­ing ten times, the Middies marched to the Irish 38 before Luther Bradley intercepted a desperation toss in the endzone as the game ended. 
"I don't want to detract from Navy whatsoever," Notre Dame mentor Dan Devine said. "but we didn't play our best game either offensively or defensively. We were ripe to be upset and I'm proud of the team that we weren't. I'm just very glad to be out of here with our lives." 
Despite allowing 21 points, the Irish defense did establish a new school record for most consecutive quarters without allowing a touch­down by shutting out the Middies in the first quarter. The first quarter ended with Notre Dame ahead 3-0 a 47-yard Dave Reeve field goal and the Irish completting their 21st consecutive quarter with­out allowing a touchdown. 
But Notre Dame only enjoyed their new record for 1 :58 as Leszczynski victimized Jim Browner on a 17-yard scoring pass to Dave King as Navy took a 7-3 lead. On their next series, a fake punt backfired on the Irish, with Navy getting the ball on the Notre Dame 45. Leszczynski then took his team to the Irish one where Larry Klawinski powered his way into the endzone to give the Midshipmen a 14-3 advantage with 
II :36 remaining in the half. 
Notre Dame got back into the game on their next possession as Rick Slager combined with Dan Kelleher on a 58-yard scoring strike. After an exchange of punts, the Irish marched 60 yards behind the passing of Slager and the running of Steve Orsini for their second touchdown with AI Hunter covering the final five yards to take the lead 17-14 with 2:53 remaining in the quarter. 
Five seconds later Ted Burg­meier recovered a Navy fumble at the Middic 13. Following a penalty and a 12-yard loss, Slager found Hunter free on the sideline for a 28-yard touchdown pass. The play gave Notre Dame a 24-14lead with two minutes to go in the half. 
The Irish had another chance to score in the first half as a pass interference call put them on the Navy two-yard line with 47 seconds remaining. But a dropped pass in the endzone cost Notre Dame another score as time ran out. 
In the first half the Irish could manage only 24 yards rushing while gaining 184 yards passing. Sla~er threw 21 times in the half, Dan Kelleher [left] had a great day with one touchdown and receptions and ~teve Orsini [right] rushe~ for 78 yards to help lead 

completing 11. Neither team scored in the third quarter as the Notre Dame defense settled down and the offense used the running of Steve Orsini to control the ball between the twenties. Navy closed the gap to three with  make the score 27-21 with 11:49 on the clock. From that point on, it was simply a battle between Leszczynski and the Notre Dame defense. Lesczcynski connected on 21 of 46 attempts for 294 yards. King tied a Navy record by being on the  attempts for 241 yards. Dan Kelleher enjoyed his best day of the season hauling in seven of Slager's tosses for 162 yards, including a 58-yard scoring pass and a brilliant diving catch to set up another score.  Terry Eurick responded with 60 yards in the second half as the Irish tried to hold the ball and use the clock. "It was a great day for me." he said. ''All I was asking for was a chance to play, and that's what I got."

Dave Reeve answered for the Irish with a 24-yard field goal to  receiving end of ten of those completions for 179 yards. For the afternoon. the Middies only man­aged 55 yards rushing. Slager hit on 12 of 26 pass  AI Hunter and Orsini led the Irish ground attack with 78 and 75 yards respectively.
