And early Sunday morning, two others were arrested at another party at Notre Dame apartments. 
Police said I 00 to 200 were at that party. 
A South Bend police officer, who requested anonymity, said police were not increasing pressure or doing anything unusual in their response to student parties. An arti· cle in yesterday's South Bend Tribune reported that "police spec­ulated that the new alcohol policy at the University of Notre Dame will result in more off-campus parties and more liqour law violation ar­rests."

Eileen Bender, a former assistant professor of English, filed suit against Notre Dame in United States District Court last Thursday. Be­t:ause of Its refusal to renew her teat:hing contract, she is charging the University with discrimination ·on the basis of sex, age and religion.

Mario Cuomo to defend religious/ political views at ND 
By mERESA GUARINO 
Assistant News Editor 
New York Governor Mario Cuomo will defend his views on abortion and the relationship be­tween religion and politics when he speak.' at Washington Hall next Thursday. 
Cuomo, who is a Democrat, was invited to speak at Notre Dame last june, befort· his keynote address to the Democratic National Conven· tlon in July. 
Cuomo's lecture is sponsored by the John A. O'Brien lecture series of the Department ofTheology. 
Cuomo's views on the separation between Church and state have led to several disagreements with New York Archbishop John]. O'Connor over the issue of legalized abortion. 
During a televised news confer­ence, O'Connor had said he couldn't understand "how a Catholic in good conscience can vote for a candidate who explicitly supports abortion." 
Cuomo, who is Catholic, has ex­plained that while he personally opposes abortion, he still is sworn to uphold the United States Constitu­tion, which guarentees freedom of choice in such a matter. Cuomo has since been speaking on whether his personal religious beliefs should af. feet his policies as governor. 
During his tenure in office, Cuomo, like his predecessor, Gov. Marlo Cuomo Hugh Carey, has inciuded abortion funding for the poor in the state budget. 

Cuomo recently announced his intention to begin a national discus­sion on the role of "formal religion" in public policies. 
In an interview with The New York Times, he said he believes "the Church has never been this ag· gressively involved" in such national policies before. 
Cuomo has said he believes the nation is built on people who don't impose their religious beliefs on others. "So I'm a Catholic governor," he said. "I'm going to make you all Catholic?" 
In response, Bishop James W. Malone, National Conference of Catholic Bishops president, released a statement saying that American bishops do not endorse or oppose political candidates. The statement noted it "would be regrettable ifrdi· gion as such were injected into a po­litical campaign through appeals to candidate's religious affiliations and commitments." The statement also said that the United States Catholic Conference does not agree that can· didates' personal views should not influence their policy views: "the implied dichotomy-between per­sonal morality and public policy-is simply not logically tenable in any adequate view ofboth." 
Cuomo's lecture will begin at 8 

p.m. in Wa.o;hington Hall's auditorium.

In Brief 

Riot police with clubs, dogs and water cannon attacked 300 demonstrators singing the national anthem in San­tiago's main square yesterday, and one man was killed during an­other protest against military rule. By midafternoon, police reported 163 arrests in Santiago as opponents ofPresident Augusto Pinochet's 11-year-old military regime began two days of demonstrations aimed at paralyzing the country. The Rev. Pierre DuBois, a Roman Catholic priest, said a 25-year-old rehabilitated drug addict was shot in the back by police while manning a street barricade in the La Victoria working-class district. But police officials said the slain man was a "common criminal" and the shooting was not related to the protests. Andres Zaldivar, president of the worldwide Christian Democratic Movement, was among those arrested in the downtown demonstration and about 50 people, including labor opposition leader Rodolfo Segue!, were injured there. -AP 
Israel's two main politicalpartiesreached 
a "preliminary agreement" on a bipartisan government yesterday, and party leaders Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Shamir will meet to iron out the final details, Shamir's spokesman said. Y ossi Ahimeir said Prime Minister Shamir of the Likud bloc and Prime Minister­designate Peres ofthe Labor Party would meet today to "approve the results" of lower-level negotiations between the two parties. "If there was no certainty that such an agreement could be reached, they would not be meeting," Ahimeir said. -AP 
Soviet leader Konstantin Chernenko-
not seen in public for nearly two months and rumored to be ailing-is expected to publicly present awards to three Soviet cosmonauts today, according to Soviet journalist Viktor Louis. A story by Louis appeared yesterday in the Standard ofLondon saying Chernenko was expected to present medals to the cosmonauts. It would be Cher­nenko's first appea,rance in public since he met U.N. Secretary­General Javier Perez de Cuellar on July 13. Two days later, the official news agencyTass reported Chernenko had left the capital for his summer vacation. -AP 
Eliminating cancer and heart disease 
would prolong millions oflives but would burden society with the cost, a private research group said yesterday. The Population Refer­ence Bureau estimated, that it would cost the government an extra $1 5 billion if all Americans who died prematurely ofheart disease in 1978 had lived to their full life expectancy. The bureau, which spe­cializes in population issues, urged the government to focus re­search on slowing the aging process, to try to predict accurately the number ofelderly in the future, and to plan the programs that would care for them. The bureau's report, "Death and Taxes: the Public Policy Impact of Living Longer," drew on the work of seven re­searchers including economists, population experts and a biologist. ­

Saint Mary's rejects loft design proposals for Regina Hall rooms 

Scavenger hunt 

Notre Dame sophomore Kerry Gtll,fresbman Marla Gerace and sophomores Chuck Bidinger, Kevin Krull. 
By BUD LUEPKE 
StaffReporter 
Regina Hall contains some of the smallest rooms on the Saint Mary's campus, and because of this the De­partment of Housing and Student Life this summer considered a stan­dard loft design, which has since been rejected for safety reasons. 
jason Lindower, director of man­agement, said, "We asked a manufac­turer to design a safe loft for a room. They presented a loft with three legs on the floor and the fourth leg res­ting on something else. Like a desk." He said this plan was not accepted by the administration, structural in­tegrity being the main concern. 
In July a letter prohibiting lofts In Regina was sent out. However, some lofts were constructed despite the letter. Lindower said these lofts would be examined for feasibility today. "If the lofts are safe, they can stay." 
A Regina R.A. who has seen several of the lofts said one loft was less than two feet below the ceiling and stood close to the wire ofa hang­ing light. "It doesn't look safe to me," she said. 
Many Regina residents appear to have accepted the administration's ban on lofts. 
Student Body President Lee Ann Franks Is powerless to change the decision against lofts. "It's all up to the administration," she said. 
Director of Housing Pat Rls­smeyer was unavailable for com­ment.

China studies program kicks off successfully 
By MICHAELJ. CHMIEL 
StaffReporter 
This summer ten Notre Dame stu­dents got a rare look at a little­known culture in the first session of Notre Dame's foreign studies pro­gram in the People's Republic of China_ 
Dr. Isabel Charles, assistant provost and director of the foreign study program, believes that the China program is an extremely valuable experience. 
"The opportunity to spend time in 
a foreign country -not just tourist 
time but time in which you are 
studying in that country -is a chance 
of a lifetime," said Charles. "At this 
point, many more Notre Dame stu­
dents ought to take advantage of it 
than do." 
The China program lasts approxi­
mately eight weeks, from early June 
to Aug. I. Students can earn six 
hours of credit in Chinese to fulfill 
their language requirement at Notre 
Dame. Classes and accomodations 
are provided at the Tianjin Foreign 
Languages Institute in Tianjin, 
People's Republic ofChina. 
In its initial summer the students made the trip with program coord­inator Professor Peter Moody of the government department. 
Among the adventurers was junior Paul Aiello, an economics and government major from Rockville Centre, N.Y. 
"Probably the neatest thing was our travelling and our climbing of Taishan -one ofthe four sacred Bud­hist mountains," said Aiello. "Where we went to school there were no foreigners in a city of 7 million people. Perhaps the most interesting thing was just walking down the street and being a celebrity." 

Gus Kelly, a fourth year English and metalurgical engineering major also enjoyed the journey through­out China. 
The best part of the program was the opportunity to go visiting around Tianjin in the afternoons," commented Kelly. "We got quite an opportunity to talk with people and ask questions -something we'd never be able to do on our own." 
"I would_ highly recommend the program to people in Business or Arts and Letters," said Kelly. "It's a great opportunity to expand your horizons and get a taste of another culture." 
The program "should broaden your horizon and help you to under­stand and appreciate your own country more as well as appreciate a country which, in a lot of ways, is very different," said Moody. 
According to Charles, Notre Dame facilitates a smooth transition for students by offering a one­semester course in Chinese. This year Zheng Yun-Shen, a visiting scholar from China will be teaching the two Chinese courses on campus. 
Admission to the program is available to all students.

Presidential candidates debate role of religion in campaign speeches 
AssocJated Press 
The campaign debate over the re­lationship between government and religion accelerated yesterday as President Reagan accused critics of advocating "freedom against reli­gion" and Walter Mondale looked ahead to a detailed presentation of his views. 
In a speech to the American Le­gion in Salt Lake City, the president said that "what some would do is to twist the concept offreedom of reli­gion to mean freedom against reli­gion." 
Reagan did not identify the targets of his remarks, but White House spokesman Larry Speakes said the president wanted to "set the record straight" in response to what the aide called "distortions" by Mondale and his running mate, Geraldine Fer­raro. 
Both Democrats have been sharply critical of Reagan's recent statement that "religion and politics are necessarily related." 
Mondale said in a radio address Sunday that the Republicans "raised doubts about whether they respect 
the wall our founders placed be­
tween government and religion." 
Mondale and Ms. Ferraro were campaigning separately in Reagan's home state of California. Mondale spent yesterday morning in his suite in Long Beach working on speeches he will deliver today and tomorrow. 
The Democratic nominee will be in Salt Lake City today to discuss arms control with the American Le­gion. Tomorrow he will speak to Jewish and Baptist meetings in Washington, D.C., and is expected to spell out in greater detail his views on the relationship between govern­ment and religion. 
Meanwhile, Vice President George Bush told a student forum at Texas A&M university yesterday that Mondale's opposition to the MX missile and the B-I bomber amounts to "giving up the store" in advance of arms negotiations with the Soviet Union. 
In his American Legion speech, Reagan referred to a "new patrio­tism" he said he was finding throughout the nation. He said that emotion might have begun with the return of American prisoners from Vietnam, the triumph of an under-

"Well, wherever the new patrio­tism came from, there can be no gainsaying its arrival," the president added. 
Reagan paid tribute to servicemen killed in conflicts and said, "We also fervently hope that such sacrifice will never again have to be asked for and that the day is not far off when there will be no new battlefields to visit and no old soldiers' stories to hear." 
On religion the president said, "I can't think ofanyone who favors the government establishing a religion in this country. I know I don't." 
Reagan said it was essential to "protect the rights of all our citizens to their beliefs, including those who choose no religion."

The hosts decided to "shut down by 1 l 1 S because too many cars were causing traffic problems, and It was getting out of hand, sizewise," Heasly said. 
Hosts then proceeded to turn off the music, untap the kegs, and usher people out, but "people still hung around." According to Heasly, "the landlord was running around pretty steamed, but he cooled off after St. joseph's County police arrived." Police broke up the crowd by I 130, and then left at the request of the landlord, Heasly said. 
Witnesses reported that the offi­cers were sporadically checking stu­dents' identification, but county police reported no arrests or cita­tions at Campus View. 
The South Bend police officer also said that security for Notre Dame home football games would "be the same as it has been for the last two or three years," consisting of four or five additional uniformc:d officers patrolling the Five Points area for liquor-law violations on game days, and possible undercover operations aimed at preventing the assault and burglary ofstudents and fans.

Associated Press 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -With a flick ofthe wrist on their giant robot arm, Discovery's astronauts brushed the irritating ice off the side of their space shuttle yesterday and packed up to come home, their shakedown flight a huge success. 
"It worked like a charm," said commander Henry Hartsfield after he gingerly guided the end of the ship's 50-foot crane over the ice that had blocked two waste water vents just behind the cabin on Discovery~s port side. 
Television pictures, taken by a camera attached to the arm, showed that only a 5-inch, carrot-shaped icicle remained. Six hours later, astronaut Judy Resnik used the 

camera again and reported: 
"We have some good news for you; we took another look at the nozzle and there is no ice." 
NASA had worried that the un­welcome hanger-on, estimated to weigh up to 30 pounds, might break loose and damage the ship's tail during Discovery's violent plunge through the atmosphere today. Such an occurrence would not have en­dangered the astronauts, but might have required costly and time-consuming repairs before the next flight. 
The third ship in NASA's shuttle fleet is to end its inaugural voyage with a desert landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California today at 
6:38 a.m. PDT. 
It will return with an empty cargo bay, evidence of its success in launching a record three communi­cations satellites on the six-day flight. NASA, which earned $37 mil­lion for the triple-header, said yes­terday that all three satellites have reached the high orbit necessary for operation. 
The two other prime objectives of the mission -testing a 102-foot solar sail for stability and manufacturing test quantities of a pure drug -also were successful and so was a stu­dent's crystal growth experiment. 
Industry engineer Charles Walker had some problems with the equip­ment he used to produce the publicly unidentified hormone, but he said he overcame most of them. The student experiment was cut short by blown fuses, but it had run long enough to get results.

Bender believes the failure to renew her contract is a mistake, and her aim is to rectify this error. She still hopes that this will be settled outside ofcourt, but says that or not as good a teaching record as her own. Procedural errors were also committed in her review that were absent in the reviews of younger or male colleagues, Bender alleges. 

Finally, Bender charges that be­cause she is Jewish she was sub­jected to further discrimination. The suit states that Notre Dame is even considering a recommendation prefering Catholic faculty over non­Catholics in some cases. 
Bender said that she is not inter­ested in publicity, but in correcting any misunderstandings so that she

mention of Walter Mondale or the ultra­liberal policies he espouses. 
But let's take a more realistic view of Reagan's policies, and leave Mondale to dig his own grave. 
Ronald Reagan has always believed that it is the government that should tighten it's belt rather than the American people. It is for this reason that Reagan broke with the traditional democratic policy of "tax and spend" by reducing personal income taxes and cutting out wasteful governmental programs. The democrats charge that the tax cut favored the rich while it hurt the middle-class and poor; this Is simply not the case. Statistics prove just the opposite, and when indexing goes into ef­fect no one will benefit more than the lower class and the poor. Concerning social pro­grams, the democrats would have you believe that Reagan has drastically cut each and every program. In fact, Reagan has cut the amount of the increase to each program (which is only logical when one considers the drastic reduc­tion in the inflation rate). Some use food stamps as an example of where Reagan has "m:u.lt across the board slashes". The truth of the matter is that under the Reagan admin­sitration more people than ever are being aided by that program. 
In 1980 a poll was taken which asked what the individual felt was the major problem facing the United States. Overwhelmingly the people exclaimed INFlXflON! Ronald Reagan has always believed that inflation was the cruelest tax of them all. In 1980 the infla­tion rate was 13.'5 percent, now it hovers around 4 percent. In addition, Reagan fought to reduce the burden ofunemployment; pres­enlly the rate of unemployment is a point lower than when Carter-Mondale left office and it is still dropping. In 1980 interest rate~ were 21.5 percent and now they have been reduced to the low teens. The stock market in the last two years has broken record after sales record. The prediction by democrats that the "bottom would fall out" during this past sum­mer has proved to be categorically wrong. In contrast, economic inc.icators are painting a rosier picture for the fut tre than even Reagan predicted. 
Turning to Reagan's foreign policy, we see that he does not have the "Itchy finger" which the democrats predicted in 1980. In fact he has had a more stable policy which rests on negotiating out ofstrength. We have regained respect around the world which we lost during the Iranian Hostage crisis and not one inch of soil has been lost to communism un­der his administration. Some democrats claim that Ronald Reagan has not met with the So­viet leadership because of his staunch anti­communist views. What they fail to take into account Is that since Ronald Reagan took of­fice there have been three different (and quite 
ill) Soviet leaders. Reagan has opened the door many times, hopefully it will be soon that the Russians step through. 
In regard to those who attack Reagan's policy In Grenada as similar to Afghanistan, they are sorely mistaken. The Grenadan res­cue mission was the only appropriate ~;esponse to the Cuban interference and the invitations by six Caribbean nations. We acted justly and when we were finished we left; hardly the same can be said about Afghanistan. Gone are the days when foreign policy meant stopping athletes who have trained all their life from participating in the Olympics. Gone are the days when the burden of foreign policy was placed solely on the grain farmers, with no international effect. Gone are the days of a weak NATO alliance. We have a strong, consistent foreign policy with Reagan as our leader. 
The choice is clear. Ronald Reagan has proved that he is an excellent leader. We have economic recovery and growth. We have a firm, coherent foreign policy. We have a return to traditional values; family, faith and pride. We have a strong leader who is first to admit that we have accomplished much, but we have much more to do. As he says, "We cannot, must not, and will not turn back. We will finish our job."

How you play the game 
"For when the Great Scorer comes 
To write againstyour name 

He marks-not thatyou won or lost 
Buthowyou played the game." 
From AlumnusFootball 
by Grantland Rice 

The following is a fictional conversation with Grantland Rice, a famous sportswriter duriJ1g the 1920's. 
G1 antland, both your special tie with Notre Dame and your words in "Alumnus Football" 
Vernon Marchal afterwords 

are well known. This season is being widely regarded as a pivotal one and contrary to the view expressed in "Alumnus Football," the difference between winning and losing will probably determine whether Head Coach Gerry Faust stays on at Notre Dame. Given that this pressure to win seems to be the rule rather than the exception in athletics, how would you respond to the charge that your philosophy, lacks any real practical applica­tion to the world ofsport. 
You think thisphilosophy impractical? 
Well, I'm sure you've heard the saying "If winning didn't matter, they wouldn't keep score." 
Yes, I've heard that. However, as perilous as it may be to fly in theface ofsuch a saga­cious remark, I would like to respond by as­king how the current philosophy is any less impractical? 
What do you mean? 

Well, I gather from your reference to Faust and your other remarks that you think the philosophical nature of sport now is such that everybody is required to win. Let us, then, examine thisphilosophy with respect to a specific sport. You seem particularly inter­ested In college football, so we'll use that as an example. Now, as I understand it, in col­lege football the goal is to win what is known as the "mythical" national champi­onship. Is that correct? 
Yes 

And it is also correct that only one team can win this championship? 
Yes, that's right. 

Well, if the goal of all college football teams is to win the national championship, and ifit Ispossiblefor only one team to win, then all the teams that do not win must, in effect, be losers. Given all ofthis, I fail to see the practical application of a philosophy that demands everyone win in a sport where 99percent ofthe teams lose. 
I guess not every team has to win, only those teams that are supposed to. 
Oh, I see. And which teams are supposed to win? 
Well, Notre Dame, for one. 

Ah, Notre Dame. Wbo is it that says that Notre Dame is supposed to win? 
The pollsters, mostly. Notre Dame ha..~ been rated in the top ten the last three years at the beginning ofthe season. 
I see. And bow many pollsters actually play college football? 
All right, I see what you're getting at. But you have to admit that Notre Dame has had a lot oftalent the past three years and, in spite of this, the team has shown a surprising lack of ability, discipline, character... 
A lack ofcharacter, you say? 
Surely you're aware that Notre Dame has been beaten by Air Force twice, tied by Oregon, and humiliated on national T.V. by Miami? 
Yes, that's interesting, -a lack ofcharacter. May I, for a moment, ask you some ques­tions? 
Certainly. 
I was wondering if, in your career here at Notre Dame, you have ever taken a test that you have not done particularly well on? 
Yes, a few. 
And these tests, were they an indication of a lack of character on your part? Did you humiliate yourself through you~ perfor­mance on these tests? 
No, I put a lot of effort into preparing for some of them. 
Butyou still did poorly. 
Yes, but that's not the point. 
Its not? Then what is the point? 
The point is that I tried. 
Ah, you tried. So what you are saying is that it is not really fair for me to make a judgement aboutyour character on the basis ofyour performance. Rather, what I should base this judgement on isyour effort. 
Yes, that's right. 
But how do I know that you really tried? All I have is your word. 
I guess you really can't know for sure. 
But, as we said before, it is clearly notfair for me to assume that you did not try simply becauseyou didpoorly. 
Right. 
Now, getting back to Notre Dame's lack of character in its two losses to AirForce... 
Yes, I think I know what you are going to say... 
You do? 
Yes. That it was unfair of me to judge the character ofthe football team simply because they performed poorly. 
And why was it unfair? 
Because It Is one's effort that is most impor­tant in any undertaking, and nobody can truly judge anyone's effort except his own. 
So, perhaps my philosophy is not as im­practical as it once bad seemed. 
No, maybe it really isn't. 
Now, ifI may presume to ask one more question, who was it that said "If winning didn't matter ... 
You know, I don't think anyone remembers. 
Hmm. I wonder why ... 
P.O.BoxQ 
Stick to studying 
Dear Editor: 

After reading Mr. Skorcz's response to Marc Ramirez's enlightening "Freshmen's Compre­hensive Guide to the Campus," we also felt compelled to respond immediately. We too are freshman and were not at all amused by the infantile nature of Mr. Skorcz's reaction. 
Mr. Skorcz showed very poor taste in res­ponding in such an asinine way. Mr. Skorcz states that he is neither a simpleton nor a child, hi:> letter clearly contradicts his words. 
l'or even a simpleton can comprehend the dif. ference between an insult and a true piece of satirical art. 
What is really disturbing in this case is that Marc Ramirez should be commended and not condemned for showing his comical abilities. Nor sh~uld a whole paper be judged solely on one article, whether the article be good or bad. Perhaps Mr. Skorcz should stick to his studies and quit writing superfluous letters to the editor.

"The girls learned that they have to keep digging deeper and deeper if they want to win," he said. 
The Irish would fall behind again in the second game. Down 9-2, the team exploded, rallied, and eventu­ally evened the score at thirteen. They took the next two points, win­ning 15-13. 
The Irish erupted in game three, humiliating the Metros 15-2. It was domination. Pure and simple. Vintage volleyball. 
The fourth game turned out to be a sea-sawing nailbiter. The Irish led 5-1, trailed 7-9, and then reclaimed the lead. Behind the serving of JiJ.l Suglich, the Irish began to click. Thanks to impressive play by Morin and Josie Maternowski, the Irish went back on top, 12-9. But the Metros would claw their way back to a 12-12 deadlock. Minutes later, however, with Karen Sapp serving, the Irish would triumph 15-12. 
The match left coach Lambert smiling. Said the victorious mentor: "It's our first win ofthe season, we're 1-1, and we're having fun."

Big, strong, and well experienced. 
That's how Head Offensive Line 
Coach Carl Selmer describes this 
year's line. 
After looking at the members of the unit the statement would hardly be left open to question. With a com­bination totaling almost I,400 lbs. of beef and nine monograms earned, anyone would feel safe behind this offensive line. 
The line is headed by Larry Wil­liams at the strong guard position. This 6-6, 272-pound senior was elected as one of the Irish tri­captains for the 1984 season. Wil­liams has been moved from quick tackle to strong guard this season where his size and strength could best help the team. It will be this senior's job to replace Neil Maune who started every game for the Irish last year at this position. In evaluat­ing Williams efforts in the past, it can be seen that he is more than capable to do the job once done by the graduated Maune. 
This versatile lineman has been on many pre-season All-America teams, all of which will hold up if Williams 
Situation pending appeal 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -St. Louis Cardinals shortstop Ozzie Smith was suspended for seven days and fined a reported S5,000 by the National League yesterday for bumping and knocking down umpire Steve Rip­pley in a game last Saturday night. 
The league, in announcing the penalty, said Smith had appealed the suspension, and as a result, remained eligible to play. No date was set for the hearing. 
While the NL did not announce the amount of the fine, Cardinals spokesman Jim Toomey said it was 55,000. He said Smith, in addition to appealing the suspension, also will appeal the fine. 
Rippley fell to the ground after being bumped by Smith during the Cardinals' 8-4 loss to the Houston Astros in St. Louis. As the Cards came off the field after the seventh inning, Smith stopped and said something to the umpire. Rippley ejected him and the infielder charged at him. 
Rippley said contact was made, causing him to fall on his back. 
Smith, who had disputed two close calls made by Rippley at first base, said afterward he was ejected for saying "wake up" to the umpire. 
continues to perform the way he has 
in the past. 

Members of the offensive line, as well as the entire team, can also look to senior Mike Kelley for leadership. Kelley, a 6-5, 266-pound senior, started every game at center this past season and can only add experi­ence and consistency to the entire squad. 
Like Williams, Kelley has an excel­lent chance in earning All-America honors at his position. 
At the strong tackle position the Irish have Mike Perrino. The 6-5, 275-pound junior started eight games last season and will assume this role this week against Purdue. Although he experienced a shoulder injury which required arthroscopic surgery last April, it is expected that this will not hinder Perrino in any way. 
With the movement of Larry Wil­liams to strong guard, the position of quick tackle is left wide open. Tom Doerger will be the man to fill the position. This 6-5, 272-pound junior played in all eleven regular season games last season while starting at both quick guard and strong tackle at different points. Doerger has proven to be an invaluable asset be­cause of his capabilities to play each position on the line. 
Tim Scannell, a 6-4, 277-pound junior, has earned the starting spot at quick guard. Scannell started in eight games during the 1983 cam­paign; however, he has had some in­juries in the past that have cut some of his playing time. If he stays healthy, though, he can only add more experience and strength. 
Although the starting line-up may be well established, the Irish have more than enough depth on the bench to back the starters up. Junior Ron Plantz should see a great deal of time. This 6-4, 271-pound junior is another extremely versatile player who can play any position on the line. Seniors Robbie Finnegan (6-3, 246lbs.) and Jerry Weinle ( 6-3, 251 lbs.) and sophomore John Askin (6­6, 271 lbs.) will provide plenty of support to an already strong offen­sive line. 
Selmer has been very pleased with the efforts made thus far in camp. Al­though regulars Neil Maune and Mike Shiner have been lost to graduation, Selmer says, "We have virtually the same line as last year, only with a little more experience." 
With the high quality ofplayers on this year's offensive line, the Irish of­fense, as a whole, should be at least as strong as it was a year ago.

He said he didn't mean to bump 
Rippley or knock him down. 
"It's been appealed, so he'll be 
able to play until he gets a hearing,"

said. "He'll play tonight, he'll play to­

this is settled." 
teague officials apparently based. 
their decision on a "hurried" look at 
game films and the reports filed by 
Rippley and the other umpires 
working the game, Herzog said. 
"It depends on which films you 
look at and the angle at which it was 
taken," he said. "If you look at it 
close, you can really see that Ozzie 
just stepped on his foot and Lonnie 
intercepted him. Ozzie wouldn't 
even have bumped him. 
Pitt's Fralic offends many in interview 
Associated Press 
Pitt offensive tackle Bill Fralic, 
being promoted by the university 
for this year's Helsman Trophy, has 
offended some administrators with a 
no-holds-barred, expletive-filled in­
terview in the campus newspaper. 
"I like to go play golf and go (expletive) girls and get drunk," Fralic told Tbe Pitt News in a story published last Friday. "Ifyou can put that In there, put that in there. I don't care." 
Of the Heisman, Lombardi and Outland trophies to outstanding col­lege football players, Fralic said, "1 don't really worry about awards. l don't know what the hell some sportswriter in East (expletive) is gonna write about or who he's gonna vote for.l imagine there's a lot of guys that vote because they like this guy because he's from the school they like." 
Both the student reporter who conducted the interview, Joe Zeff, and the newspaper's editor, Todd Erkel, have resigned, but said their moves had nothing to do with the Fralic interview. "We did take out a number of profanities," Zeff said. "We felt the ones we left in were im­portant to the story." 
Fralic said he was only joking and didn't expect his words to be printed.

The match will be a chance for revenge for the Irish, who were losers last year in their opener at IUPU, 1-0. Six Notre Dame players were injured in the game, which then-Irish coach Rich Hunter called "the worst physical beating we've ever had in my seven years here." 
The game tonight also will be the debut of Hunter's successor, Dennis Grace, and the last thing the new Notre Dame head coach wants to see is more injuries. 

The Irish already are suffering from several injuries, although they have yet to don their game jerseys. Two starters -captain Steve Chang and Eric Evans -appear to be out for the season with broken legs, while several other players are suffering from less serious injuries. Forward Pat Szanto and midfielder Chris Telk both are doubtful for tonight's game. 
Grace says he realizes that IUPU is a good team, but he points out some of the advantages the Irish will have tonight. 
"(IUPU) teams are always ex­tremely well-prepared, extremely fit," he says. "They beat us last year, which I think can work in our favor. And we have them at home, which I think can work in ourfavor." 
Leading the attack for the Irish will be senior tri-captain Rkh Her­degen. The 5-11 forward was Notre Dame's leading scorer last year with 16 goals and 1 0 assists. 
Meanwhile, Dominick Driano, the team's third captain, will be anchor­ing the defense. Driano will con­tinue to play in the sweeper position, where last year he was a solid force in the "Irish Curtain" which allowed opponents only 15 goals. 
If these team leaders and the rest of the Irish play up to their potential tonight, Grace says he feels Notre Dame will emerge victorious. 
"I know (IUPU) had a great recruiting year," Grace admits, "and they return almost all of their starters from last year, but I think if . . we play like we can play, we'll be very tough to beat." 

Violations hard to prove 
Faust attacks illegal recruiting 
Notre Damefootball coach Gerry Faust bas always been adept atgetting the top talent in hisfour years of recruiting on the college level. In that time, more than once bas Faust run across others who break the rules. Today, in part two of The Observer's three-part series on recruiting violations, Faust fields questions from sports writer Theron Roberts on this growingproblem. The series will conclude tomorrow when Notre Dame athletic director Gene Corrigan takes a look at the sit­uation from the perspective ofan administrator. 
Q. How do you start the recruiting process? 
A. First, we eliminate 60 percent of the great high school athletes because, even if we wanted them, we couldn't get them into Notre Dame; either be­cause their grades weren't high enough, or be­cause they didn't take the right courses in high school. Then we analyze them football-wise. He's got to be a great athlete and have the potential to be an even better one. The next thing we do is we check out with guidance counselors, people in school, and coaches what kind of person he is. I'll never offer a kid a scholarship without visiting a kid. In fact, I took back an offer ofa scholarship ofa kid whom I visited at home, and some things went on that told me that this is not the kind of person who belongs at Notre Dame. So, I withdrew the offer. 
Q. Do you think that as many recruiting violations oc­cur as NCAA Executive Director Walter Byers sug­gested? 
A. I know that there are a lot of questionable things that happen as far as recruiting in college football. There are so many great athletes in high school that it's hard (for the NCAA) to keep tabs on all of them. Some of the violations are more serious than others, but I think any violation is a serious viola­tion if it's done with intent to recruit an athlete illegally. Take the contact rule. Most people other than us abuse that rule, which dictates how many times you're allowed to visit a kid at home and at school. 
Q. Have you ever lost a recruit where you thought an inducement was offered by another school? 
A. Definitely, but to prove it is another thing. I've had high school coaches tell me that their own kids were illegally recruited by other schools and we lost the kids for that reason. I personally have run into a couple of cases of illegal recruiting where I've called the coach and told him that it was going on, and it stopped. There's one young man whom we recruited a couple of years ago who a high school coach from another school told us we were wasting our time recruiting. He said the kid was offered $10,000 up front and $10,000 when he signed. Three days before he was supposed to

In a slam-bam night of women's volleyball at the ACC, the Irish bet­tered their season record to l-1 by getting the best of IU-PU in a tough fought match, winning three games to one. 
But everything was not fine and dandy for the Irish in the first game. Unable to get on track, the Irish allowed IU-PU to jump out and take command, 11-2. Late in the game the Irish started to fight. The Metros had the lead, 12-6, and the ball, but they lost their service and it was side-out, Irish. 
And then things started to happen. With freshman Kathleen Morin ser­ving, the team pulled within two at 12-l0. Kathleen Baker and Tracy Bennington keyed the Irish surge, but the magic did not last, and the team fell to the Metros, I 5-I I . 
The tables would turn in the next three games. The Irish would topple theMetrosl5-13, 15-2,and 15-12. 
Coach Art Lambert compli­mented the team's gutsy comeback.

Odds favor Irish in Indianapolis 
Hello again, everybody! 

Wake the kids and call the neighbors, because it's time for football excitement. The much-ballyhooed game be­tween Gerry Faust's Fighting Irish and Leon Burtnett's Purdue Boilermakers in Indiana's latest monument to the high-tech era -the Indianapolis Hoosier Dome -has fi­nally arrived. Fans of both teams are excited about the prospect of traveling to Indy to see the season opener, and they have good reason to feel that way. 
On the surface, this game looks like it could be a rout, since the Irish destroyed Purdue last year 52-6 and have many of the same people coming back. However, there are several questions this game may answer. How good is Notre Dame's defensive secondary? How potent is the Irish offense? How bad is Purdue? Ifthe answer to any or all of these questions is "Not very," the Irish could have their hands full. 
Dome DoingsGranted, the ride down U.S. 31 may not be the most exciting four hours of your life, but the Hoosier Dome is an attraction well worth the trip. In­dianapolis has already used its newest structure to lure an alleged professional sports franchise (the Colts of the NFL) and is hoping to be included in the next expansion by major league baseball. 
People who have toured the Hoosier Dome and reviewed it are liberal with their praise. Most people say there's really not a bad seat among the 62,000 in the house, and the facility is immaculate. Ifthere is a flaw, it is a lack ofadequate parking space around the stadium. So, if you're driving down to the game, let this serve as fair warning. 
For Openers...If history repeats itself, the odds are heavily in Notre Dame's favor. The Irish are a remarkable 82-8-5 in season openers and have only lost once when they opened the season away from home. Add to that stat the fact that Gerry Faust has not lost an opening game

Irish Items 


during his tenure at Notre Dame. Looking at those fig­ures, Leon Burtnett may want to borrow Faust's rosary beads. 
Boller Bits...Burtnett may need more than the rosary by the end of the season. Another campaign like the last two in which he went 3-8 and 3-7-1 and Purdue fans may be saying"Arrivaderci Leon." The pressure is on Burtnett this year, and unfortunately, he doesn't have a wealth of experience on the roster. 
Before you start crying for Purdue, though, look at the some of the people the Boilermakers do have on the roster. Burtnett can turn to a pair offine quarterbacks in senior Jim Everett and freshman Doug Downing. The coaching staff won't decide until Friday who will start, but look for Everett to get the nod. He had a fine game last year against the Irish in relief of Scott Campbell, and he can really fire the ball. 
Elsewhere on offense, Purdue has a pair of solid run­ning backs in Bruce King and Rodney Carter, and some fine recievers in split endJeffPrice and flanker Rick Brun­ner. The line has three starters returning and plenty of size to give the Boilermakers some time to throw the ball...something they will do frequently Saturday. 
Defensively, Purdue returns seven starters who must help improve what was a bigger disaster than Pearl Har­bor last year. The Boilermakers only held three teams under 30 points in 1983 with a young, inexperienced group. With a year of playing time under their belts, Burtnett is hoping people like free safety Rod Woodson and linebacker Kevin Sumlin can keep Purdue in the game. 
Irish Update...As far as personnel is concerned, the Irish have moved Robert Banks into one of the outside linebacker spots due to the injury of Mike Larkin. Banks has good speed, and should be more than sufficient as a replacement. Other than that, the Irish have a few nag­gingproblems, but nothing to keep anyone from playing. 
One thing to watch for on Saturday will be the perfor­mance of the specialty teams. With the departure of punter Blair Kiel and place-kicker Mike Johnston, the Irish will be using relatively inexperienced people to fill those slots. Mike Viracola will handle the punting chores, while John Carne;y will take care of kicking off the tee. If it's a close game, it could come down to how well these people perform. 
Don't look for any major strategy surprises from the coaching staff. You know Notre Dame will want to mix it up more on offense than last year, so Allen Pinkett will probably only carry the ball a maximum of20 times. Look for Steve Beuerlein to throw more often, as well as hand­off to the fullbacks with greater frequency. 
In short, the Irish have said what they want to do, and now it's up to Purdue to stop them. It's just that simple. 
Pickofthe Week.. .Another team will open the season with Purdue this weekend. Jill Lindenfeld will make her Irish coaching debut as the Notre Dame field hockey team will open the season against the Boilermakers Sun­day at 3 p.m. on Alumni Field. 
This team is one of the best kept secrets on campus, and after pulling off an 11-9-2 season a year ago, it's time they got some of the respect they deserve. Sophomore Corinne DiGiacomo ( 18 goals in '83) will lead the Irish attack, while junior Patti Gallagher will work in goal at trying to reduce her 1.24 GA (goals against) average from a year ago. It should be a good game, so plan to be there.
