Carters named winners of first Notre Dame Award 
Food relief from West reaches former Soviets 
Special to The Observer 
Former President Jimmy Carter and Hosalynn Carter have been named by the University of Notre Dame as the inaugural recipients of the Notre Dame Award for interna­tional humanitarian service. 
The Carters are scheduled to accept the award March 23 at 7 
p.m. at the Center for Continuing Education on cam­pus. The former president and first lady will receive an in­scribed piece of crystal from the University and Mr. Carter will deliver a lecture. 
"We intend this new award to provide prominent and lasting recognition of international humanitarian service." said University President Father Edward Malloy. "We can think of no finer examples of such service than President and Mrs. Carter."

HPC rejects 'gag rule' amendment

News Writer 
llall Presidents' Council (HPC) voted Tuesday 23 to 14 to op­pose an amendment to the by­laws of its charter that would require unanimous consent to prevent members from dis­cussing IIPC business outside of the meetings. 
The amendment, proposed by St. Edward's Hall president Rob Pritchard, read. "Unanimous consent of all voting members of the Hall Presidents' Council is required to prohibit, restrict, or discourage members from publicly diseussing the contents of any meeting, special session, committee or subcommittee of llall Presidents' Council." 
Pritchard first proposed the amendment at last week's meeting of IIPC meeting where other members asked that he add the word "unanimous" to the statement. Pritchard said that he thought the amendment would be supported after mak­ing the change. 
IIPC also unanimously passed a resolution proposed by David Ccrto, District 1 Student Senator, for the Off-Campus Crime Subcommittee. 
The resolution, unanimously passed Monday by the Student Senate, calls for funding of Weekend Wheels by Student Affairs. distribution of infor­mation packets to off-campus students. the formation of neighborhood watch programs, distribution of statistics con­cerning crime ncar campus, and increased patrolling of student residential areas.

Catholics who are distinguished in their professions, the Notre Dame Award is international and interfaith in scope. 
"In keeping with Notre Dame's Sesquicentennial obser­vance and the themes of in­quiry, belief and community," Malloy said, "recipients of the Notre Dame Award will be peo­ple for whom learning has been a wellspring of action, for whom religious faith has nur­tured deed, and for whom in­quiry and belief have inspired service to the world community. The Carters possess these traits in abundance." 
Jimmy Carter, 67, was born in Plains, Ga .. and raised in the nearby town of Archery. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy with a bachelor of science degree in 1946 and rose to the rank of lieutenant, senior grade. 
Carter left the Navy in 1953 and took over his father's farm and farm supplies business in Plains. He also became involved in community affairs and in 1962 was elected to the Georgia

On Dec. 12, 1974, Carter an­nounced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomi­nation, and despite beginning as a virtual unknown, went on to defeat President Ford in the 1976 election.

MOSCOW (AP) -Another giant C-5 U.S. Air Force trans­port plane flew relief supplies to Russia today, and the first meals of donated food -in­cluding pork chops and mashed potatoes -were served at a Moscow soup kitchen. 
The U.S.-led airlift that began Monday will meet only a frac­tion of the need -the first planeload had 100,000 meals for Moscow, a city of 9 million. The $78 million effort is small compared to the more than $80 billion in aid the European Community has sent since 1990. Germany alone has sent $45 billion. 
"It's a little shameful that my country has come to this. But what can you do? That's life," said Pvt. Andrei Chernyi, a 19­year-old recruit helping unload supplies from a U.S. cargo plane. 
Salvation Army volunteers today began dishing out the first of the donated meals at a cafeteria in southeastern Moscow. The soup kitchen, which began operations Jan. 1 with the help of private spon­sors and the Red Cross, usually feeds 300 people a day. 
About 30 people -mostly elderly, invalids and poor with families -were the first to be served today. The menu was cream of chicken soup with dark Russian bread, followed by pork chops, mashed pota­toes, corn, juice and vanilla pudding. 
"Oy, we're very grateful. That's very good. It's wonderful when people look after and respect old people," Olga Korolyova. an 86-year-old pen­sioner, said of the meal. 
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia, who has chastised the West for slowness to respond to his country's need for food, expressed thanks Monday but skirted the question of whether he was satisfied with the two­week-long airlift. 
"We cannot judge whether it is sufficient or insufficient," he said on television. "One must just express gratitude that it is coming , that at such a difficult time people wholeheartedly want to give some sort of assis­tance to Russia." 
The American food supplies -mostly rations left over from the Persian Gulf War -will provide only a few days worth of meals to people unable to keep up with rising food prices. 
For Russians, the cuisine may be as unfamiliar as the sight of American Gis. Translators were put to the test to explain chili con carne, dehydrated fish sticks, beef with gravy and ap­ple pie filling. 
Also donated are B-rations. bulk containers of food that had been stored in Spain and Italy since the war ended early last year. 
"It's all stuff that will make mouths water in Moscow." said Salvation Army Capt. Sven-Erik Ljundholm. 
He said guards were sta­tioned to prevent theft. "We will watch every pallet, every can, to be sure it gets where it's sup­posnd to," said Ljundholm. 
The airlift, dubbed "Operation Provide Hope," began with flights from Germany and Turkey, and continued today with one more flight from Germany. More than 64 flights are planned to carry about 2,000 tons of food and medicine to 23 points across the

over the waterway, and the establishing of diplomatic rela­tions with the People's Republic of China. 
Throughout his term of office, he was an outspoken advocate of human rights, which he made an integral element of 
U.S. foreign policy. 
Since leaving the presidency, Carter has continued to address world issues as a professor at Emory University in Atlanta and through numerous programs coordinated by the Carter Center. 
One of his top priorities has been Habitat for Humanity, which he serves both as a direc­tor and by pitching in with a hammer and saw on the orga­nization's home-building pro­jects for the needy in this coun­try and abroad. 
He also has been visible and effective in resolving conflicts around the world. He helped cool tensions in Nicaragua in 1990 by monitoring the national elections and assuring that the Sandinista government then in power had permitted a free and fair choice. A year earlier in Panama, he served in a similar role, and when he found the election to be a fraud, never flinched in saying so. 
lie brought representatives in Ethiopia's 30-year civil war to the bargaining table in 1989, and he has worked for several years in an effort to bring sta­bility to Haiti. 
"We don't want to duplicate what others can do," he told the Washington Post. "But there's a vacuum we are attempting to fill." 
A 1946 graduate of Georgia Southwestern College, Rosalynn Carter works closely with the Mental Illness Foundation, the International Commission on Peace and Food, and her own Institute for Human Development. In addition, she often is side-by-side with her husband building Habitat homes. 
Both Carters already hold honorary degrees from Notre Dame. In 1977, then President

Scapegoats found for American woes 
Thank goodness for Japan. 
Our litlle buddies on the 
Pacific have certainly 
proved to be good for 
America in one aspect. 
They certainly make good 
political scapegoats for a 
faltering United States 
economy. 

"Mr. K Car" Len laeocca, a group of other "poor. mistreated" American business leaders and our beloved president went hand-in-hand on a journey to the Orient, blasting the Japanese for unfair trade practices. 
"Them lyin', eheatin', connivin' .laps have 
killed us with their cheap labor and dirty 
business practices," whined a distraught 
Yosemite lacocca. 

And after Bush put the final exclamation 
point on the journey, by hurling on the prime 
minister, back to America they carne. 
Bush carne back with a strict promise from 
the Japanese that they would let more 
Matchbox ears in, and the U.S. promised to 
pay for the prime minister's dry cleaning. 
Since their return, Japan bashing has be­come en vogue. laeoeea started the trend, with his swashbuckling commentary on the trip. 
Suddenly, everything has become the Japanese's fault. The economy, unemploy­ment, our loss of' industrialization, why Johnny Carson isn't funny, and why little Joey didn't do his homework can all be blamed on Japan. 
I have to admit, they are really are a lot smarter than I thought they were. 
Somehow the Japanese were able to infiltrate the upper levels of government and big business, and destroy the fabric of American society. 
In the biggest secret attack since Pearl llarbor, the Japanese switched General Mo­tor's and Ford's plans for hi-tech ears in the 70's with plans for Pintos, Gremlins, and Volares. What a cheap shot! 
Not only did they ruin our automobiles, those dastardly villains got a agent into the 
U.S. Education Department and wrecked our school systems. Consequently, thanks to our sushi-eating friends, our education system has become one of the worst in the world. 
Thanks to Mr. K Car, Americans are now properly Jap-phobes, afraid to be connected with anything Japanese. 
In Seattle, the Mariners are for sale and the Japanese owners of Nintendo, have made the best oiTer. 
The baseball commissioner, Fay Vincent, is pondering whether to let them purchase it, and corrupt the great American past-time. 
Hecently, a factory has barred those em­ployees with Japanese cars to park in the front parking lot. Because they chose to sell out, they park in the back. 
That's great, that's what America is all about, freedom. 
Well, Japan, you better straighten up, or next time we'll send Quayle who will do more than hurl.

WORLD IRA bomb does not deter Quayle 
London-A bomb apparently planted by the IBA was found by police Tuesday near government buildings where Vice President Dan Quayle was scheduled to meet with British officials, the home secretary said. The device was discovered after several bomb warnings reportedly prompted authorities to evacuate the build­ings. Home Secretary Kenneth Baker said the bomb was found in a telephone booth near the Foreign Office. lie said quick action by police could have "saved a great deal of destruction, damage, possibly even death." Sky Television said telephoned bomb warnings were made in the name of the Irish Hepublican Army by callers using a recognized code. The U.S. Embassy said Quayle had not changed his schedule. 
NATIONAL Health plan ignores mental illness 
washington-President Bush's health care proposal ignores the needs of millions of Americans who suffer from mental illness, the American Psychiatric Association said Monday. "The president is sending the clear mes­sage to all Americans who suffer from mental illness: 'We do not need care if you get the treatment you need,"' said Dr. Melvin Sabshin, medical director of the group. Bush's plan would allow states to set basic health coverage stan­dards and provide tax credits and deductions to help Americans buy insurance. But no state would be required to cover treatment for mental illness or addictive disorders. "The president wants his administration to be a thousand points of light, but his health care plan leaves 23 million American in total darkness," Sabshin said.

Other motorists dung to trees after the Los Angeles Hiver overflowed a huge recreation anm Monday afternoon and sent a torrent of water onto busy Burbank Boulevard. Hescuers flew at least three Fire Department helicopters and paddled rafts to bring about 50 motorists to safety. The storm dumped more than six inches of rain in the San Fernando Valley, a white-collar suburb of homes, office parks and malls. Los Angeles County health officials, afraid the rain might swamp a waste treatment plant and cause a spill of raw sewage, dosed 60 miles of beaches. The waters rose to 25 feet in the Sepulveda Dam Hecreation Area, a huge crate-like area of golf courses and wildlife preserves. 
CAMPUS Some financial ajd may be too good 
Notre 
Dame, IN-It appears to be the time of year when college students are most vulnerable to financial aid organizations of questionable validity, according to Joseph Russo, director of Financial Aid. At least one student has received a letter notifying him that he is eligible to receive an allegedly customized scholarship based on the individual's academic and financial status, he said. The letter, from an organization called the National Scholarship Foundation, asks the student to call a certain number within 72 hours; then the student must call a 900 number -at a cost of $3 per minute -to get more information. "Buyer beware," said Husso. "When something appears to be too good to be true, it probably is" in the financial aid business.

Burkholder talks about communism's recent unraveling 
By GERALDINE HAMILTON 
News Writer 
"Communism has virtually disappearnd as something that commands the respnct of peo­ple," stated J. Lawrence Burkholder, president emeritus of Goshen College during a lec­ture Tuesday. 
Burkholder spoke on the topic of "China in Light of the Hussian Hevolution," which was hnld at the llesburgh Library Faculty Lounge. 
Burkholder was present dur­ing the Chinese cultural revolu­tion in 1975, during the Tiannamen Square protest in 1989 and also the aborted coup in Moscow this past year. 
Despite all that Burkholder knows about both the second Hussian revolution and China, in his opening comments he stated that it was very difficult for him to know for certain what relation the two had, so all he could do was surmise what the the Chinese were thinking and saying in reaction to the events in the former Soviet Union. 
After Tiannamen Square the facade that China put forth is

that of everything being normal. 
"The lie is normalization," states Burkholder. People, when they arc asked in public about the state of affairs in China say that things arc fine, just as they were before Tiannamen Square happened, he said. 
"Ask people privately and they say that things are not go­ing well and they want to get out of the country, but officially China is going along normally," said Burkholder. 
The type of communism in China is different then what was in the Soviet Union, Burkholder said. The former Soviet Union, he said, had a government that was strictly centralized in Moscow. 
China is somewhat decentral­ized, promoting private owner­ship. Burkholder states that when money is tight the deci­sion making is centralized in Beijing, but when money is looser private entreprenurial­ship is encouraged. 
Yet, since communism all over the world has collapsed the Chinese are starting to feel concerned about the threat of divisions and revolts within the country, according to Burkholder. 
Systems Programmer from the Office of University Computing, said that the program has been available to students since January, and he asked if mem­bers of the HPC saw any value in its expansion.

There is a generation problem in China, Burkholder said. The young people are no longer interested in the philosophy of Marx; the young are caught up in western trappings, states Burkholder. 
According to Burkholder, the Chinese government is deter­mined to maintain control and order. "The Chinese are fearful of anarchy," he said. 
They are accomplishing their goals well; everyone is eating, has a place to live, and a large majority of people have jobs. 
Burkholder said that the Chinese government is "getting along fairly well, but they are doing it by repressive means. As they feel more insecure they tighten controls." 
While the Chinese govern­ment is working to maintain order and there is evident striving for more freedom from some of the people, according to Burkholder, in the former Soviet Union there was a revo­lution in which communism was beaten by democracy, but only three lives were lost, and two of those deaths were uninten­tional. 
Burkholder stated that while watching the revolt from the

Members of HPC responded favorably to his presentation. 
parliament building he was "amazed that there can be so much chaos without people los­ing their lives." 
"I just can't understand how a nation, a empire, can make the transition from one form of government to the other with so much chaos and so little loss of life. I'm sure people in Beijing are watching and waiting to sec what happens," he said. 
Bulkholder went on to state that if Boris Yeltsin, the presi­dent of Russia, can hold on to democracy in Russia for one or two years and outlast the chaos, democracy may be able to survive. 
The Russian people have been under communist rule for so long that they lack initiative, are used to taking orders and are very dependent, yet they are very able to endure suffering, which may be the key to the success of democracy in Russia stated Burkholder. 
"The people in Bejing are wondering what is going to happen," said Burkholder. 
There are starting to be some divisions in the different regions of China, Burkholder said. The western and eastern parts of China have always been rivals, he said; the people of the west feel that they are looked down upon by the people of the east. 
"In the Soviet Union the union broke up, could something like that happen in China? Probably not, but there are regional spir­its," Burkholder said. 
The Tiannamen square democracy forces will emerge again, but it will take time, ac­cording to Burkholder. "There is a fear that China may go the way of the Soviet Union. It would be impossible for com­munism to be moved toward democracy without a period chaos, and chaos is what they don't want," he said. 
"The young people are having second thoughts and are not going to push too strongly." 
As for the future of both the former Soviet Union and China Burkholder states, ''I'm not sure, I have a lot more faith in the stability of China then I do in the former Soviet Union." 
Yet, Burkholder also makes it clear that he is very concerned with the human rights abuses presently taking place in China. 
The United States relations to China, Burkholder believes, should be one of "conversation." He stated, " I would hope that the United States continues to express its concerns, yet remain in contact with China." 
This lecture was part of a series sponsored by the "Friends of the Library" pro­gram of service to the library and the local community.

N. Hampshire 
CONCORD, N.H. (AP) ­Democratic presidential candi­dates today opened an intense drive to court the big bloc of undecided voters in next week's showcase New Hampshire pri­mary. "Things are fluid," said Sen. Tom Harkin following his favorite-son victory in the Iowa caucuses. 
With the first trophy of the 1992 campaign in hand, Harkin was returning today for the finishing burst in New Hampshire, where his cam­paign has yet to command the kind of attention he received at home Monday night. 
Harkin received almost 80 percent of the vote, a result he deemed "far better than I ever imagined." He dismissed his trailing position in tll,e polls in this state and said. in an inter­view on NBC's "Today" he could win here next Tuesday because "the people are a lot like the people of New Hampshire." 
"All I can say is stay tuned, because things are happening in New Hampshire, things are fluid, almost 50 percent are undecided, they're making up their minds ... " he said. 
"I am in this to the end and I believe you're going to be very, very surprised at what happens in New Hampshire." His rivals skipped Iowa, forfeiting to

IU fraternity suspended following hazing incident 
BLOOMINGTON, lnd.{AP)-The Indiana University fraternity where a pledge almost died recently from drinking too much alcohol was temporarily suspended Monday by its national organization. 
Alpha Tau Omega national headquarters, in Champaign, Ill., took no action following an informal investigation at the end of January, immediately after the incident. 
"Initial evidence suggested that it was an isolated incident and the choice of the individu­als involved," ATO Executive Director Mark Thorsby said in a Monday news release. "However, new allegations have surfaced that require further investigation." 
ATO Director of Communications Wynn Smiley of the national office said the decision to investigate further was made after seeing news re­ports Sunday and Monday that the incident may not have been isolated, but part of pledge "dads" night at the fraternity. 
Pledge dads night is when pledges are assigned fraternity member "fathers." 
The decision also was based on reports from the national office investigator who has been in Bloomington, and on information from other people in Bloomington-including some fraternity alumni advis­ers. 
In the initial incident, ATO members brought pledge Dennis Jay, 20, an I.U. sopho­more from South Bend, to Bloomington Hospital just after midnight on Jan. 29. 
He was in a coma, and his blood alcohol level was mea­sured at 0.48, a level that is often fatal. lie was released from the hospital Jan. 30, ap­parently without long-term physical damage.

Let there be submissions to fill the air: 
QUOTES, P.O. Box Q, ND, IN 46556 
Dear Editor: 
Thursday Jan. 23, 1992, is a day that will remain for many in the Notre Dame community a realization of some of our worst nightmares. In the tragic loss of two dear friends, coupled with the 35 others who were injured, we seek answers to some of our deepest questions. 
The first and probably biggest question is "Why?" Why them: two young, healthy, energetic, talented people? Many people take their grief out on God by asking, "Is this right? Is this just?" These are difficult ques­tions to answer. Using the Scriptures, however, we can learn much about life and the significance of death. 
We must realize that God is not a killer; God is love. His Son had to die, for without this death our eternal life would not be possible. Many of Jesus' disciples were martyrs, and one might ask, "Why would God allow His followers to die?" It is all a part of His ultimate plan, one that we as humans cannot always see. In the same token, Meghan and Colleen were called up to God for a purpose unseen to us at the present. 
God has given a promise to those who have accepted Him and His Son. "For we know that if the earthly tent which is our house is torn down, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens" [II Corinthians 5:1]. He has promised to take care of His followers and give them life everlasting, a life without pain, filled with His ultimate protection and glory. 
Original death was a result of human's sinfulness. Adam and Eve sinned and were told by God that they would eventually die. It was that original sin that allowed death to enter this world. God has allotted each of us seventy years according to the Scriptures, while some He calls at a young age. Grieving the loss of two friends is a natural part of our lives. 
"To every thing there is a sea­son, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: A time to be born, and a time to die ..." are the words by the writer of Ecclesiastes. In this passage we see a fundamental truth to life; that is, everything happens for a reason. Our earthly lives are but a small portion of what our lives will be after death, and thus it is important to make sure of our future after this life. 
To answer the question "Is it just for the young to die?" I must answer, no. For those who love Christ and die at an early age get to spend more time with Him in eternity. So while we continue to grieve the losses we have experienced, let us not forget the gains they are experiencing right now.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Cuban refugee describes problems caused by Castro 
Dear Editor: 
This letter is in response to the views expressed by one Professor Cutrofello in The Observer Viewpoint section. 
First, as a Cuban refugee who sought freedom in this country, and second, as a parent of a son who is a Notre Dame student, I feel eompclled to write and challenge Profe-ssor Cutrofello's views. 
One only needs to look at the number of Cubans who are now risking their lives to cross the Strait of Florida to eome to this country and to the other hundreds of thousands who have left, and realize that no matter what Castro says or his sympathizers argue, Cuba is a mess. 
When one hears first hand stories of living conditions in the island, you realize that these conditions have taken back the island at least 75 years. Not only is their agriculture now done by oxen drawn plows, and the lack of automobiles and other vehicles force people to use bicydes for transportation, but even in Havana such necessities as water and electricity are lacking as well. 
I do not know if Professor Cutrofello was ever in Cuba prior to Castro's time or after, but I can clearly remember back to what it was and can now hear of what it has be­come. Of course you cannot take away the natural beauty of the country, but when you hear of residences and buildings being kept propped up by wood beams (because otherwise the structures would fall), and these same buildings having not been painted or repaired for nearly two decades because Castro ehooses to spend his money in exporting revolutions to other countries in the world, it makes you wonder. 
Did Professor Cutrofello care to consider the following: 
If Castro was so good to his people wouldn't he have used the millions of dollars it took to host the Pan American Games and instead use these funds to help their living conditions; 
Why must the Cubans people now give up any food that they grow in their patios and gar­dens to the government or risk jail; 
That those individuals found carrying the HIV positive virus are kept at the former leper colony· outside of Havana Province "Rincon de San Lazaro". According to doctors inside Cuba, as a result of Castro sending his armies to Angola and Africa the number of carriers of this virus is a very serious health problem which Castro is keeping away from world knowledge so as not to bring attention to his subversive poliey in that part of the world. 
Relative to his argument that things are bad in Cuba because of the US government embargo, should he not ask himself how Communism can, after so many'years, fail in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe (to my knowledge there was no embargo to those countries), and further to his argument that the peasants are better off now. 

I find that am using since now is not the wealthy and the middle class who are leaving Cuba, but precisely the poor and the peasants who the Revolution was suppose to help and who after more than 30 years find themselves worst off. 
Lastly, I feel that it is ap­palling for the education pro­fession to give such an erro­neous and distorted view to a eaptive student audience as Professor Cutrofello has and I wonder if the Professor has thought where would he be for expressing similar views if he lived in Cuba and the roles were reversed. 
I can only assure him that he would not be at a University free to teach, but at some lonely solitary confine­ment cell rotting in jail for ex­pressing his views. Thank God he lives in a free country. 
I am sorry if my letter sounds a bit angry, but after so many years of living in this country I find it hard to believe that there arc still people (and a College professor no less) who don't seem to understand or care to really learn the Cuban situa­tion. 
I am, and will always feel indebted to the people of the United States who gave me, and so many others like me, an opportunity to come to this country and accomplish any goals we set for ourselves and the freedom to do it. 
It is my hope and dream that the Cuban people left in the island receive God's given strength to hold on for just a while longer, so that when Castro is finally defeated, we ean help them and our beloved Cuba become once again a free and democratic country. 
P. S. Maybe we will even invite Professor Cutrofello to visit.

Cash stations and compu­fessionals 
C 
hastity walked to the steps outside of Sacred Heart Church, stopped in front of a computerized machine bearing a striking resemblance to a Cash Station, made a sign of the cross, and 
slowly knelt down on the kneeler in front of it. Chastity has sinned and comes to make peace with herself and with God. 
While Chastity was at an off-campus party over the weekend, she accidently fell asleep on a couch (she was watching a movie, of course) and woke up at 9 a.m. the next morning. She found boys sleeping in the same room as she. 
Oh, goodness me! Chastity broke parietals, the most capital sin of all sins. The Prince of Felonies. (Yes, parietals apply off-campus.) She shamefully walked home from Campus-View and headed straight for this handy compufessional located outside of Sacred Heart Church, where we find her at the present time. 


i\fter kneeling, she carefully placed her SINS card into the slot and deposited her weekly offering: 
"Please enter your Secret Sins Number." 
Chastity entered 1-S-1-N. 
"Please enter the type of sin you have committed: press 'V' for venial, 'M' for mortal, and 'I' for indescribable." 
Chastity enters 'M' for mortal; after all, what greater sin exists except for the breakage of parietals? 
"Please enter what great body of rules you have violated." A screen pops up listing: a) du Lac, b) The New Testament, e) The Old Testament, d) Federal or State law. 
Chastity enters "a" for she has violated the most serious of the law books. 
"Please enter the letter of the sins that most closely matches yours." Another screen appears that lists, alphabetically, all of the possible du Lac offenses, from possession of a souvenir cup (du Lac, p. 33) to sexual intercourse. Chastity enters 'P' for parietal violation. 
A booming voice announces: "YOU HAVE SINNED, CHILD!" 
Then a softer, voice asks, "Are you sorry for your sins? Please make a selection." The choices that appear read, a) yes, I am heartily sorry for my offense and realize this could keep me out of law school, or b) no, I am a rebel and a mindless lawbreaker deserving expulsion. 
Chastity chooses 'a' for it was merely an accident, an extremely serious one for which she is heartily sorry. 
"Please wait while your penance is pro­cessing." 
She hears her penance slip being typed up. It reads: Please pray five rosaries, turn yourself in to student affairs, and wear a scarlet letter 'P' (for parietal violation) on all articles of clothing. 
Thank you for using this compufessional! 
Chastity takes her penance receipt and her SINS card. As she does so, a large picture of Father Malloy appears on the screen. He says the words, "Go in peace now, child. Your sins are forgiven." 
Is this scenario a prophesy of the future of the Catholic Church? In light of the growing shortage of priests, perhaps it is a viable solution years from now. 
Though most Notre Dame students are not directly affected by or do not notice this lack of priests, it is a growing problem, especially in smaller rural communities. 
It is important for church leaders and lay persons to scrutinize this problem and explore other viable solutions to the "compufessional." 
In decades to come, married and/or women priests may be a far better solution to this problem than compufessionals.

Four one-act plays directed by and starring freshmen will be performed tonight 
The Observer/ Sean Farnan 

By JOHN O'BRIEN 
Accent Editor 
Tonight, a large group of fresh­men will invade Theodore's. 
This may not come as a surprise to most students, but the reason why the freshmen are there might surprise a few. 
They won't be there to dance-they'll be there to act. 
The Freshman Year of Studies is presenting "The Freshmen Four," four one-act plays 
directed by  and  starring  
freshmen,  at  7  p.m.  in  
Theodore's.  

In its second year, "The Fresh­men Four" is the brainchild of Michelle Martin, an advisor in the Freshmen Year of Studies. 
Martin decided to start "The Freshmen Four" last year to get freshmen involved in plays at Notre Dame. Because freshmen cannot declare a major in Communication and Theater, it is often hard for them to be cast for roles for which they try out, Martin said. 
"I wanted to start a tradition where freshmen can get experience and meet others with like interests," Martin said. 
Cast members rehearse the one-act play, "Murder Well Rehearsed." 
This year, Martin is taking a less active role in the production of the plays. 
"My part has been more of the logistical roles-it's really the student's thing," she said. 
Subtitled "For Freshmen... By Freshmen," the production is in­deed that. The four plays star a total of 45 freshmen actors and are directed by four freshmen. The production is entirely student-run. 
The chief director of the play is freshmen Jen Andre, who is directing the play "Juvie," a drama by Jerome McDonough about 11 juvenile delinquents in a detention center. 
This year's production has sparked great interest in the the­ater among those participating, said Andre, who directed one play and acted in several others while in high school. 
"It's confirmed for me that I want to keep directing if I can," she said, adding that she plans to major in Communication and Theater at Notre Dame. 
Freshmen Sean McKenna, Tony Leonardo and Colleen Rooney will also take the director's chair at some point 
tonight. McKenna will direct "Murder Well-Rehearsed," a whodunit, while Rooney will direct "Baby," a "Look Who's Talking" -esque comedy about an infant's view of the world. 
Leonardo is making his directorial debut with '"Dentity Crisis," a contemporary comedy written by Christopher Durang. 
His play is "difficult to describe," Leonardo said. "It's a little off-the-wall and a little insane, but it's got a point in all of its ridiculousness." 
While these students are still amateur directors, giving more control to the students this year hasn't hurt the quality of the production, Martin said. 
"I've been really pleased with the way things turned out this year, the students have put in thousands of hours of work on this," she said. 
Tickets for "The Freshmen Four" are available for $2 at the Freshmen Learning Resource Center in Brownson Hall. It is doubtful they will be available at the door, Martin said. 
"I think it's going to sell out," she said.

and the judge said that it was a total mix-up in wording...the whole thing was screwed up. So when they did the records check it appears as a felony. So they [the University] accused me of falsifying my application." 
"I was never, ever charged with robbery," Anderson said. 
Anderson said Cincinnati offi­cials told him that there was another man with the same name in the city, and that there probably was a mistake made on Anderson's record. He claims he was advised to have an expungment hearing in front of a judge, which he said he scheduled for April 26,1991. 
"I investigated it, I had a lawyer investigate it. I have since then had the whole thing expunged." 
Regardless of the confusion surrounding his application, Anderson was still dismissed from his coaching position. 
"He was in a volunteer posi-

tion, it was not paid, and he was treated differently than any salaried coach," O'Leary said. 
"I have no comment on that," said Rosenthal. "He did not work for the athletic depart­ment. Club teams report to NVA, which is now RecSports. He was not dismissed as an employee." 
Kelly, whose jurisdiction in­cludes club sports, refused to comment on the specific reason for Anderson's dismissal. 
"I don't really have a com­ment," said Kelly. "We looked into his application last year and there seemed to be some confusion. We mentioned to Bill until those things were taken care of we would have to hold off. We got another coach, Steve Anderson, and there were some disagreements between him and the players. But we have no comment on that. 
"There were no complaints about Bill by the players to my knowledge," Kelly added. 
"I played under Bill Anderson for a whole year, and he got

along really well with everyone on the team," stated one men's volleyball player who spoke un­der condition of anonymity. "There were never any conflicts with him, all the players re­spected him and there were never any words behind his back. 
"To be honest, we're realizing now that he was dedicated to the team. He was coaching the St. Joseph's High School girls' team at the time. The biggest thing was that he put forth the effort and dedication. He seemed to get along really well with the coaches of the teams we played. We're just confused about it because we really haven't been informed about what really went on." 
Oddly enough, Anderson had led the Irish club to the NCAA national tournament in 1990-the first Notre Dame appearance in nine years. Under his tutelage the Notre Dame men's club was Northern conference champion from 1986-89, with Anderson being named Midwest Intercollegiate Volleyball Association coach of the year in 1986 and 1987. 
Anderson said he also served as Notre Dame assistant women's volleyball coach under Art Lambert from August 1985 through 1986. In 1988, he re­ceived an NAACP Image Award. He also received the Jesse Owens leadership award in 1985. 
Anderson is currently the head girls' volleyball coach at Niles High School in Niles, Mich. He coached the St. Joseph's High School girls' team from 1988 to 1991, and LaSalle High School's girls' team from 1987 to 1988. 
Under Anderson, LaSalle won its first sectional championship appearance in 15 years (1987), while he led St. Joseph to the sectional championship in 1988 and 1989. 
Anderson was an All-Ameri­
can at the University of Cincin­
nati in 1982 and a member of 
the junior national volleyball 
team in 1982-83. He trans­
ferred and graduated from In­
diana University-Purdue Uni­
versity Fort Wayne (IPFW) with 
a B.A. in Law Administration 
and an associate degree in 
Criminal Justice.

Mosley named Irish running backs coach 
Special to The Observer 
Earle Mosley has joined Lou Holtz's Notre Dame football staff as running backs coach following tenures as an assistant coach at Temple, Northwestern and Hutgers. 
Mosley replaces Tom Beck, who coached the Irish running backs for a single season in 1991 before resigning last month to become offensive coordinator at Illinois. 
Mosley spent the last four seasons (1988-91) at Temple under head coach Jerry Berndt. The Lansdowne, Pa., native served the four previous seasons (1984-87) as an assistant at Northwestern-the first two under Dennis Green, now the NFL Minnesota Vikings head coach, and the last two under Francis Peay, a

perfect free throw shooting kept Notre Dame close in the early part of the first half. Marciniak and Nowlin scored with the help of Washington while sophomore Kara Leary and llaysbert made the Blue Demons regret fouling them. Things went sour for the Irish in the later part of the second half as DePaul outscored the Irish 24 to 10. 
"I thought we had a chance," said Nowlin, "but we made some mistakes. We had some breakdowns on offense and de­fense and we let it get away." 
Notre Dame has been exper­imenting with new combina­tions of starters in recent games in an effort to find a winning chemistry and to work around recent injuries. Last night, the starting five included Leary and Marciniak at guard, freshman Letitia Bowen and Haybert at forward, and Nowlin at center. Washington injured her knee in the game against Xavier and was supposed to stay on the sidelines for at least a week, but she played 18 former Irish assistant himself. lie coached four seasons as an assistant at Hutgers from 1980-83. 

Mosley has coached six players who have gone on to the National Football League-Deron Cherry (five­time all-pro with Kansas City chiefs) and Kenny Smith (Detroit Lions) in 1980 at Rutgers, Carl Howard (Dallas cowboys and New York Jets) in 1984 at Rutgers, Kevin Brown (Los Angeles Rams) in 1985 at Northwestern, and Mike Constantatos (Philadelphia Eagles) and Kenyatta Rush (Phoenix Cardinals) in 1990 at Temple. 
A 1973 graduate of West Chester State with a degree in health and physical education, Mosley spent the 1979 campaign on the staff of his 
chances at the free throw line to increase 63-60 lead with eight seconds in the game. Ellis missed the first free throw long, and Irish fans held their breath. The next shot, however, found net and sealed the game. A desperation three pointer fell 
minutes in last night's game. 
"Coach wanted me to play to give Kara (Leary) and Michelle (Marciniak) some rest. Turns out I needed to play more than that," said Washington. 
The first half provided some hope for the Irish as Notre Dame led for the almost the en­tire half and matched DePaul shot for shot. Towards the end of the half, Notre Dame pulled ahead and at one point held a 25-16 lead on a Marciniak three-pointer and tough play alma mater. He previously spent six years on the staff at Chester High School in Chester, Pa., the last four as head football coach while also assisting in track and wrestling. he coached Chester to the 1978 Delaware Valley Class A title, it first in 42 seasons. 
Mosley is close to finishing requirements for his master's degree in education at West Chester State-and he took classes in Temple's graduate sports administration program. 
A graduate of Lansdowne­Aldan High School in Lansdowne, Pa., Mosley earned three letters as a defensive back at West Chester State, captaining the team as a senior in 1972.

"The game wasn't sealed until Phons made the second free throw," said MacLeod. "That was a big free throw, because he had been struggling. He re­ally showed me something there."

with consistent shooting and Irish turnovers in the final minutes of the first half. 
The loss dropped the Irish to 6-14 and extended Notre Dame's losing streak to three games. Nonetheless, the team isn't ready to give up on the season. 
"It's frustrating (to lose) right now, but we still have the conference tournament ahead and that's not out of reach yet," said Nowlin.

"There were a couple times when I couldn't stop him from getting the ball because I got into some foul trouble. When that happened, 1 wanted to play tough defense after he caught the ball," Ellis said. 
Even when he got the ball in the half-court set, the baskets did not come easily. Keefe had to beat the double team all night. 
"We wanted to do to him tonight what other teams do to me every night," Ellis com­mented after the game. 
Though the Irish defense did a good job on Keefe, MacLeod was still impressed by his abil­ity. 
"He moves like a Jot of good post men. He moves so quickly and is so mobile. He's got great speed, and he got great ability with the ball to put it on the floor," he said. "We wanted to double team him, but there were times when he was gone before we could get our defend­
ers in." 
In addition to keeping Keefe from dominating the game, the Irish also got more than the usual three players, Elmer Bennett, Daimon Sweet and Ellis, involved in the offense. Billy Taylor and Jon Hoss each chipped in six points, and Tower took five shots, but only scored two points. 
"Every game !Coach MacLeod! says if the shots arc there, he wants me to take them. Tonight, with the plays we were running, I was getting the open shots," Taylor said. 
"Stanford did a great job on Phonz early, so we tried to get Billy Taylor going. lie was three for six !from the noorl and that is encouraging." MacLeod commented. "However, we would like to get to the point where we can have five or six guys in double figures. If we can do that, our half-court game will start to look a lot better."

Tyson returns to courthouse 
Evaluations of Tyson's 
Convicted of rape, fighter could face 60 years in prison 
INDIANAPOLIS (AP)-Boxer Mike Tyson returned to the courthouse today a convicted rapist, awaiting a routine probation meeting after being found guilty of attacking a Miss America Contestant he lured to his hotel room. 
The conviction late Monday was Tyson's darkest moment in a troubled history with women, and it threatened to end the rags-to-riches career of the youngest heavyweight champion ever. 
Tyson arrived at the City­County Building about 10:50 
a.m. EST-about 12 hours after the verdict was delivered-and was greeted by the crush of reporters and photographers, as well as about 40 supporters who shouted "Hang in there, Mike!" and "Don't worry about it, Mike!" He had a serious look on his face and did not acknowledge the show of support. 
He and two of his attorneys walked briskly into the building and up the stairs that lead to the probation offices for a meeting that is standard procedure for anyone convicted of a felony. 
During the interview, Tyson was to be asked about his criminal and social history so that an evaluation could be prepared for the court, said a probation department recep­tionist who refused to give her name. 
The 25-year-old boxer could get up to 60 years in prison at sentencing March 6. But based on average sentences given in similar cases in Indiana, he probably will receive between seven and 11 years said Deputy Prosecutor Barbara Trathen. 

Mike Tyson 
Tyson remained free on $30.000 bail. 
"We've seen so many times recently that it doesn't matter what a superstar does-it s OK," prosecutor Greg Garrison said after Monday night's verdict. "He can brag about it in his books, he can demonstrate it in the public eye, and as long as it suits him, it s all right. 
"And I think tonight, one time anyway, this kind of behavior's not been tolerated.' 
Tyson stared straight ahead. He showed little emotion as the verdict was read. Guilty on one count of rape and two counts of criminal deviate conduct. He had no comment as he left the courtroom. 
Asked what his most effective evidence was, Garrison said, "That beautiful 18-year-old kid with a pure heart. She's a young person with a lot of courage." 
Tyson's defense-that he was a crude womanizer whose accuser knew from the start that he wanted sex, and consented-didn't stand up to the victim's story and the physical evidence, jurors said. 
'The accusing witness made a very convincing case. We looked at not only a moment in the bedroom but a chain of events that evening," said the jury's foreman, a 37-year-old IBM marketing representative and ex-Marine. "It was an accumulation of evidence," said the foreman, who refused to give his name. 

The victim wasn't in court when the verdicts were read. Trathen said the woman felt "just a sense of 'It's finished,' relief." 
Tyson was scheduled to challenge Evander Holyfield in a bid to regain the title last November -after being indicted-but that bout was canceled when Tyson injured a rib. It was not rescheduled when the trial began Jan. 27. 
Nothing in boxing regulations would automatically bar Tyson from fighting while free on appeal, but boxing's governing bodies and state boxing commissions could refuse to sanction a match. And no promoter would undertake such a fight under those circumstances. 
Tyson's accuser testified that he had promised to take her sightseeing but instead went to his hotel on the pretext of making a phone call, pinned her to his bed, stripped her, raped her and laughed while she cried in pain and begged him to stop. 
Other evidence included testimony from an emergency room doctor who said the woman suffered mJuries consistent with rape, and a chauffeur who said the woman appeared shaken when she emerged from Tyson's hotel July 19. 
impact on boxing vary 
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -Life after Tyson. 
That's what the world of boxing faces in the wake of former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson's conviction Monday night on a charge of rape and two charges of deviate sexual conduct. 
"It means absolutely nothing to boxing," said Bob Arum, an arch-rival to promoter Don King, who is Tyson's promoter. "In some way it helps boxing because it eliminates someone who is perceived to be a bad apple in the mix." 
That's not how Seth Abraham sees it. 
Abraham is president of Time-Warner Sports, and Time-Warner is the parent company of HBO, which pre­sents cable television boxing shows, and of TVKO, which presents pay-per-view boxing telecasts. 
TVKO was set to telecast Evander Holyfield's defense against Tyson Nov. 8, which was canceled when Tyson suffered a rib injury while training in October. 
That fight was expected to gross more than $100 million. 
"The most profound effect, obviously, is on the heavyweight championship, and that connects with the other divisions," Abraham said. "As the heavyweight division goes, so goes boxing." 
The sport, however, mirrors the people who make a living from boxing. It is a survivor. 
Also, when the heavyweight division is in decline, smaller fighters come to the fore. 
"Other divisions got attention when Muhammad Ali was out (form 1967 to 1970 because of his conviction for refusing in­duction into military service)," Abraham said. 
It was smaller fighters who starred between the title loss of Jack Johnson in 1915 and the championship win of Jack Dempsey in 1919, from the retirement of Dempsey in 1928 until the rise of Joe Louis in 1936, and from the retirement of Louis in 1949 until the rise of Rocky Marciano in 1951. 
"There's enough big fights," Arum said. "George Foreman-Holyfield (in a rematch) is big enough," Arum said. "There will be more big combinations in the years ahead." 
There, however, will be no single attraction like Tyson, a major draw no matter the caliber of the opponent. 
"He is a legitimate cash register,"Abraham said. 
Without Tyson, there is not a real leader in the heavyweight division, which badly lacks depth. 
"It is open season without Tyson," said 42-year-old Larry Holmes, a former champion, who admittedly wants no more to do with Tyson, who knocked him out in 1988. 
Holmes, however, would like a title shot against anybody else. And Holmes and the 43-year-old Foreman are attractive, especially against one another, to the nostalgia crowd.

Taylor follows his father's lead 

Irish freshman is second-generation basketball player 
By JIM VOGL Sports Writer 
Although a little shorter and slimmer, Notre Dame freshman Billy Taylor seems to be filling his father Dennis' shoes just fine. 
Dennis Taylor was a 6-foot-7 forward/center for Northern Illinois in 1969-70 and 1970-71. He averaged 8.4 points and 8.9 rebounds as a junior, 6. 9 points and 8.4 rebounds as a senior. 
Billy Taylor is a 6-5 small forward who averages 6.1 points and 3 boards per game as a freshman starter for the 7­11 Fighting Irish. 
"My father's had a lot of in­fluence on my game. We've been playing together since he got me started playing," said 

,. Taylor, who considers his fa­ther's strength-rebounding-to be his own main weakness. "lie has a stronger build. When he played, he was a good jumper, a good rebounder," said Taylor, who has much bigger, stronger, and quicker competition than in the days of his father. But Irish coach John MacLeod predicts that Taylor will definitely gain strength in the following years and become a solid rebounder. Dennis Taylor was officially the coach of only two of Billy's teams, but he has helped in­struct his son every step of the way. The two play together in summer leagues and in one-on­one. The elder Taylor also of­fers advice and compliments after home games, regularly traveling from Aurora, Ill. to sec his son play at Notre Dame. "I think Billy's inherited a lot 
right back and works on it until 
he gets the problem solved." 
Taylor is the only Irish freshman to perform consis­tently this season, winning the starting position before the first game of the season. Three games later, he contributed a season high 16 points on 8-of­11 shooting against Valparaiso in the team's first win. 
"lie proved himself worthy of a starting position," said MacLeod, who was impressed by Taylor's ability to shoot the ball in the open court, run the floor, and show quickness de­fensively. 
Of the latter quality, MacLeod explained, "If you consider the number of difficult assignments that he's had, he's performed very well." Averaging 30.9 minutes a game, the freshman has run into some of the na­tion's top scoring mid-sized players. The list includes DePaul's David Booth, Duke's Grant Hill, Indiana's Calbert Cheaney, USC's Harold Miner and Missouri's Anthony Peeler. 
"It helps my confidence to know that I can guard them," said Taylor. "I don't have to go into a game worrying that someone will eat me alive." 
Offensively, Taylor's role has been to knock down the medium-range shot. He has proven much more efficient (47-for-105) than backup small forward Carl Cozen (8-25). Compared to the aerial show of Ellis and Sweet, and the play­making of Bennett, Taylor's role seems limited. But when the senior trifecta leaves, Taylor hopes to become a more versatile offensive threat. 
failing to control a player. Murray was suspended for an incident in which defenseman Yves Racine left the penalty box to continue an altercation in the Red Wings' 5-5 tie with the Hangers Sunday night. Racine was suspended without pay for 10 games. Both suspensions will begin Tuesday night. Associate coach Doug MacLean will run the team in Murray's absence. Murray had hoped he could appeal his suspension, but Rule 66, which covers what discipline is to be handed down when a player leaves the bench or penalty box. is clear and leaves no room for appeal. 
Jer~ Glanville: Two-sport Coach? 
DATONA BEACH, Fla. -Atlanta Faleons eoach Jerry Glanville is negotiating to become part owner or a NASCAR team put together over the weekend by Felix Sabates and Kyle Petty. Glanville "wants to buy part of the team," Sabates said. "He'll be here Wednesday. so we'll see." Sabates, who owns the Winston Cup team Petty drives for, has committed to buy the Busch Grand National race cars of Team Ill, whose owner Sam McMahon III is facing bankruptcy proceedings in Charlotte, N.C., with his father, Sam McMahon Jr. Glanville had been negotiating to drive in races with Team Ill begininning March 1 at Rockingham, N.C. 
Defiant Loss Gives America3 A Boost 
sAN DIEGO -Defiant's first loss in the America's Cup Defender Selection Series was a victory-for America3 the boat, America3 the syndicate and Buddy Melges the skipper. The America3 Foundation's newest boat, also named America3, was launched only last week and has already won its first two races, defeating its older stablemate, Defiant, on Monday in the third raee of the second round-robin of the defender trials. Melges, from Zenda, Wis., had served as skipper of Doflant in the first round but was at the helm of Ameriea3 Monday. Melges, an Olympic goJd medalist in 1972 and Star class world champion in 1978 and 1979, has not lost a race in these first two preliminary cup rounds.

"As he gets a better feel for 
who he's playing and makes 
adjustments to the college 
game, he'll be even more ag­
gressive," said MacLeod. "And 
next year he'll be even 
stronger." 
Taylor's maturity shows on and off the court. His 27 turnovers are easily lowest among starters. "lie under­stands how to play team bas­ketball," said MacLeod. 
While still a junior at West Aurora High School (averaging 
18.6 points and 9 rebounds), Taylor committed to Notre Dame. As a 16-year old being recruited by the likes of Northwestern, Wisconsin, Michigan and Stanford, Taylor showed foresight in his deci­sion. 
"When I first was recruited by Notre Dame and Digger Phelps, the first thing they re­ally emphasized was aca­demics," explained Taylor. "I was really impressed by that. Other schools mention it, but they really sold the basketball part. Notre Dame was talking life after basketball." 
MacLeod is happy to have Taylor. "He is a solid player and a top-flight person," MacLeod said. 
Like his father, Taylor is not banking on a career in basket­ball. Dennis Taylor took a de­gree from Northern Illinois to become a Director of Operations for a business in Aurora. 
Taylor lists as his "craziest ambition: To be a CPA or CEO in the NBA or for NBC." Either one would be A-OK with his father.
