'Spring Cleaning' sweeps up Northeast Neighborhood 
By MATTHEW LOUGHRAN NewsWrirer 
Nearly one hundred Notre Dame students and some volun­teer residents worked together for four hours on Saturday re­moving garbage and raking yards in a project called, "?pring Cleaning," benefitting South Bend's Northeast Neigh­borhood. 
The project was a joint effort of the City of South Bend, Northeast Neighborhood Coun­cil, and the University. It is one of a series of clean-ups that was started last year with the cleanup of a much smaller area between Georgiana and Duey streets. 
"The main purpose of [the Northeast Neighborhood clean­up] was, of course, to beautify the neighborhood. But it also served as an opportunity for the council members to meet and work with commmunity leaders," said Phil Boelter, the Community Organizer of the Council. 
The project also gave the stu­dents a chance to get involved 
in the community and to inter­. act with its residents. 
Students arrived for the 
cleanup on Saturday morning 
at Mt. Olive Baptist Church on 
Miner Street. Three crews were 
attached to dumptrucks that 
were provided by the city. The 
trucks were given a four or five 
block area from which they 
were to remove large trash 
items. Other crews were given 
rakes and leaf blowers and 
were sent to houses that re­
quested that their lawns be 
cleaned. 

The !Northeast Neighborhood Council sent out five hundred surveys to residents which determined who needed garbage to be removed and who needed their lawns raked. 
With the success of last fall's clean-up, expectations were high. "We expect to make a sizable difference in the ap­pearance of our neighborhood," said resident Juanita Dempsey. 
After the four hours had elapsed, much of the area that the Council set aside was fin­ished. However, they did not complete all that they had set out to do. Many houses were left with large piles of trash in front of their houses. 
"We are hoping that the city will just take care of this, be­cause we ran out of time. But we may have to figure out a way to finish it ourselves," Boelter said, 
The next step in this serie$ will be a clean-up of the area between Angela and South Bend Ave. This project will be carried out next fall.

Me and five mice: a studyin annihilation 
My parents and I sort Peggy Lenczewski of knew when I left for Saint Mary's News Editor college that I'd learn many things outside the classroom, and I have. I've learned amaretto is good. I've learned that I'm a good deal more liberal than I thought. I've learned some professors are not going to take me seriously. And I've learned how to check mouse traps. 
Saint Mary's may not offer courses in Rodent Extermination, but I've had a lot of experience with mice lately. It started the Sunday when I returned from spring break. I laid in bed reading, not hurting anyone, my nose innocently buried in political theory essay. I vaguely remember hearing my mat­tresses creak, but I wrote it off as having had ice-cream for breakfast every morning dur­ing break. 
Then I felt eyes upon me. Male eyes: pari­etal-breaking eyes. The mouse sat on my pink security blanket, calmly looking at me as if nothing was wrong. 
I stopped screaming when I realized that I was in the hallway. I think I did Fay Raye proud, since my throat was sore the next day. 
The next day, the fun really began: I put out mice traps. I always thought of mouse traps in terms of Tom and Jerry cartoons: a piece of swiss cheese, a snap-spring contrap­tion, and cute mice figuring out how to get the cheese with getting caught. But this is college -I got glue traps. The wisdom behind these traps was that the mouse would walk across the trap and get stuck on the glue. The box instructed me to discard the trap and mouse." 
I had also always thought of mice in terms of The Secret of NIHM until one crawled on my bed. I changed my mind really fast. 
I caught four mice on three traps that day. I put traps and mice in plastic bags for main­tenance to dispose of. I helped a friend with one of her mice. That's five mice, five notches on the baseboard. All of them squeaked and struggled. 
Disgusting? Just a little. 
My hallmates and I convened and discussed how to best deal with our new friends. We talked about domesticating them since main­tenance had suggested that we had mice because someone wanted a pet. We kicked around the idea of leaving out food for them and naming them. 
However the rotten little suckers ate my 
miniature sunflower plants, and they agitated 
my fish. So, instead of saving them, we decid­
ed to exterminate them completely. 
The traps seem to have worked. Well, the traps and having every crevice in my room caulked completely. I haven't seen any mice in over a week. 
I've started sleeping in my room again, 
although sleeping on my friends' floors did 
wonders for my back. But I'm ready in case 
the mice return. My baseboards are lined 
with glue traps and after five mice, I am 
hardened against their plaintive squeals. 
Maybe I can train my fish to attack. 
But I know how to handle mice now, and 
who knows when this skill will come in 
handy. If I can't get a job after school, I can 
go into pest control. I could start my own 
business and specialize in college-level mice 
infestation. I'm still helping girls with their 
mice, so, by the time I graduate, I'll be an old 
pro, and I'll certainly feel that my tuition 
money was well spent.

Thousands of grieving fans pass Selena's coffin 

CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas 
Thousands of grieving fans filed slowly past the closed cof­fin of Tejano music queen Selena on Sunday, two days after she was shot to death. Mourners began lining up be­fore dawn, waiting for the visi­tation to begin at 9 a.m. By the aftern,pon, well over 10,000 had passed by the coffin, which rested on a stage amid two dozen arrangements of white roses at the city's Bayfront Plaza Convention Center. 
Some fans crossed them­selves, others shook their heads. Many wept. Two women sobbed so hysterically they had to be taken out in wheelchairs. "She never turned anyone away. She always had time for every­one," fan Sylvia Rodriguez said of Selena. 
Selena Quintanilla Perez was killed Friday at a motel where she had gone to fire the founder of her fan club, who 
French boy answers bottled message 
TRENTON, N.J. 

Seven months ago, New Jersey youths lamenting the end of summer vacation put their greetings, names and addresses into a plastic water bottle and heaved it into the Atlantic Ocean. The six returned home from Cape Hatteras, N.C., to start a new school year and forgot about the whimsical launch. But as the teens pored over their books, the maritime messenger found its way into the Gulf Stream, around Newfoundland and toward Europe -straight into the hands of an 11-year-old boy in northwest France. Marc wrote: "Greetings. My name is Marc, and I am 11 years old. I found your bottle on Saturday, March 4, 1995, at about 1 p.m. It traveled across the entire Atlantic Ocean and arrived here in France. I live in Brittany, as you can see from my address." Marc also sent post cards to the other five youths. Oceanographers say it's amazing the nautical note arrived at all. Breck Owens of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Woods Hole, Mass., said Hatteras is one of the few places where the 4,000-mile warm-water Gulf Stream current comes within a few yards of the coast. 
Evacuation after WW II bomb found 
PORTLAND, England 

An army bomb squad worked Sunday to defuse a half­ton German bomb dating to World War II as some of the nearly 4,000 evacuees were treated to music from the war years. British media reports called the operation in Portland, on England's southwest coast, the country's largest planned evacuation since the war. The 1,100­pound bomb, believed to have been dropped by a German bomber during a July 1941 raid, was buried beneath a soccer field. Diggers surveying for mineral deposits found the bomb two weeks ago. Unexploded leftovers from the Luftwaffe's blitz are regularly found in England, but they usually are smaller bombs or anti-air­craft shells. Maj. Nick Clark, directing an eight-man bomb squad from the army's Royal Engineers, said Sunday the work was expected to take another day. The team used a remote-controlled robot Saturday to drill into the bomb shell.

also ran a San Antonio bou­

suspect, Yolanda Saldivar, was 
being held in lieu of $100,000 
bail on a murder charge. 
The 23-year-old Grammy­
winner was an idol to young 
Hispanic women, a Mexican­
American version of Madonna. 
But the bereaved passing her 
coffin Sunday ranged from 
young children to the elderly. 
"I hope that this generation 
will follow her steps," said 66­
year-old Efrain Guerrero, who 
lives near the middle-class 
Molina neighborhood where 
Selena grew up and lived. 
"She did a lot of work for this 
community. She would talk 
about the necessity of educa­
tion. She talked against drugs," 
he said. "She was a lady all the 
way." 
Fans said they admired 
Selena because she broke

Hitler's bones Burned 

Former Soviet leaders had Adolf Hitler's remains incinerated in 1970 out of fear they would attract neo­Nazis, a magazine reported Sunday. Since the end of World War II, there have been numerous rumors about Hitler's fate. Historians say he shot and killed himself in his Berlin bunker on April 30, 1945. The Hamburg­based Der Spiegel said Hitler's remains and those of his wife, Eva Braun, were excavated from graves in Magdeburg near Berlin in April 1970 on KGB orders.

Six alleged Muslim extrem­ists whom police link to defen­dants in the World Trade Cen­ter bombing were arrested af­ter a raid on a suburban Manila apartment turned up guns and dynamite, police said Sunday. Police said the six, all from Arab countries, were arrested Friday in Kalookan City and will be charged with illegal weapons possession. 
A statement said the "appre­hended Muslim extremists are believed to be affiliated" with Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman.

Christopher: Sanctions need to be changed 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON 
The current practice of allowing U.S. companies indi­rectly to buy and sell Iranian oil hurts American diplomatic policy and needs to be changed, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Sunday. 
"We need to toughen our sanctions," Christopher said, adding that he would espouse that view during administration discussions this week on U.S. policy toward Iran. 
Current law bars direct pur­chases of Iranian oil for the 
U.S. market, but subsidiaries of American companies are buy­ing about $4 billion of it annu­ally on the open market for sale outside the United States. 
In addition, U.S. companies exported about $616 million worth of goods to Iran in 1993, mostly oil equipment, accord­ing to Commerce Department figures. 
"I regard Iran as a terrorist state. They're really an international bad actor, so I think we need to take a very strong stand against them," Christopher said on CBS' "Face the Nation." 
He said, "The fact that we are engaged in trading, the fact that subsidiaries of our oil com­panies can purchase oil there and sell it to Europe is a handi­cap to us in dealing with other countries. When I go to another country and say, 'stop giving concessions to Iran,' they throw this back in my face." 

As one example, he discussed the ongoing dispute with Russia over the sale of Russian nuclear reactor technology to Iran, saying President Clinton will press Russian President Boris Yeltsin to stop the deal when he visits Moscow later this month. 
"We're going to be making a strong case to President Yeltsin and the Russians that it is not in their interests," Christopher said. "If Iran develops a nu­clear capability right next-door to Russia, Russia will rue the day that they cooperated."

Hereditary gene linked with non-inherited tumors 
By MALCOLM RITTER 
Associa1ed Press 
NEW YORK 

Scientists have found the first direct evidence that a gene causing hereditary breast and ovarian cancer also plays a role in far more common non-in­
• herited tumors. 
The hereditary cases appear in women who inherit a flawed version of the gene, which fails to suppress the development of cancer as the normal gene does. 
Some 1 0 percent or less of breast and ovarian tumors are hereditary. 
Now, for the first time, scien­tists have found flawed versions of the gene in non-hereditary ovarian tumors. The genes were normal when inherited but became flawed within the patients' own bodies. 
In addition, other scientists have found that the gene is un­der-active in non-inherited breast cancers, suggesting it may play a role in those tumors even if it is not flawed. 
Scientists said the fmdings of­fer no immediate payoff for treatment. But by implicating the gene in more than just the hereditary cancers, the work suggests that developing thera­pies based on the gene could someday help more women. 
About 182,000 cases of breast cancer and 26,600 cases of ovarian cancer are expected to be diagnosed in American women this year. 
The gene, called BRCA1, causes about half of inherited breast cancers. It made head­lines last year when it was fi­nally found after a long search. 
The finding of flawed BRCA1 genes in non-inherited ovarian tumors is reported by two groups in the April issue of the journal Nature Genetics. 
One group, from the univer­sities of Michigan and Pennsylvania and the National Institutes of Health, reports the fmding in four of 4 7 tumors. A second team, from England and Canada, found a single exam­ple. 
Results suggest that flaws in the BRCA1 gene may be in­volved in at least 10 percent of non-inherited ovarian cancers, said Dr. Sofia Merajver of the University of Michigan Medical School, lead author of one re­Nashville, Tenn., report that the BRCA1 gene is much less active in non-inherited breast tumors than in normal breast tissue. 

In addition, when the re­searchers artificially reduced the effect of BRCA1 in normal and cancerous breast cells, it made the cells grow and divide faster. Such fast growth is a hallmark of cancer. 
The results support the notion that a decrease in the control BRCA1 exerts over cell growth can help cause non­inherited breast cancer, said Vanderbilt researcher Jeffrey

port. 
Some regions of the gene have not yet been thoroughly examined, and they may pro­duce more examples of flaws in non-inherited cancer, she said. 
The gene could be implicated in still more cases if its anti­cancer control is stymied by other means, such as defects in other genes that turn BRCA1 on and off, she said. 
That idea is advanced in the breast cancer study, which also appears in Nature Genetics. Re­searchers from the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Holt. 

That could occur even if the BRCA1 gene is perfectly nor­mal. 
The decrease could be caused by defects in genes that control BRCAl's activity levels, Holt said. 
Scientists can now try to identify those genes and see if they are flawed in non-inher­ited breast and ovarian cancer, he said. 
Dr. Barbara Weber of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadel­phia called Holt's work "an im­portant lead."

Rutskoi nominated as presidential candidate 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW 
Alexander Rutskoi, who was Boris Yeltsin's vice president when he bolted to join rebel­lious conservatives, was nom­inated Sunday as a candidate for president in 1996 elec­tions, Russian news agencies said. 
Rutskoi vowed that if elect­ed he would try to reunite the former Soviet republics of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. He told the Interfax news agency that his nomination was "a natural wish of the people." 
Although Rutskoi had pre­viously announced his inten­tion to run, he was formally nominated Sunday by the Derzhava political party, a loose grouping of former Communists and other hard

Rutskoi is a former combat pilot who served in Afghanistan. He was elected Yeltsin's vice president in 1991, but later joined forces with the rebellious parliament dissolved by Yeltsin in October 1993. 
Rutskoi was jailed after Yeltsin crushed the rebellion. He was released in February 1994 after the new parlia­ment declared an amnesty for the leaders of the October revolt. 
Derzhava leaders adopted a resolution saying Russia has been damaged by Yeltsin's presidency and that "he must be removed from his post through free presidential elections in June 1996," the ITAR-Tass news agency said.

Gingrich sees no hope Cisneros battles budget cuts 





for GOP compromise 
By JIM ABRAMS 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

House Republicans will prob­ably send their tax cut bill to the floor for a vote this week without resolving an intra-party dis-, pute over '\tl 
how much the wealthy should bene­fit, House Speaker N e w t Gingrich 

Gingrich

said Sunday. 
"We don't have a compromise yet, we're still arguing and I'm not sure we'll get to a compromise," Gingrich said on ABC's "This Week with David Brinkley." 
"We may just bring the bill up and see what happens," he added. 
Republicans are at odds over provisions in the bill that give all families earning $200,000 or less annually a $500-per­child tax credit. More than 100 Republicans, smarting from Democratic claims that the bill mainly benefits the rich, have signed a letter saying the ceil­ing should be reduced to $95,000. 
But Gingrich predicted that 
dissenters within the party 
would fall in line and support 
the bill, a key element in the 
House GOP's "Contract With 
America." It would reduce 
taxes by $189 billion over five 
years. 
In the end, he said, "I think 
there will be a surprising num­
ber of folks who decide voting 
yes is a good idea." 
Reps. Sonny Bono, R-Calif., 
and Roger Wicker, R-Miss., 
two freshmen who signed the 
letter seeking scaled-back ben­
efits, indicated on NBC's "Meet 
the Press" that they, neverthe­
less, would vote for the 
Gingrich plan. 
"I simply was for reducing to 
the $95,000 figure because I 
thought it was a more reason­
able figure," said Wicker. "It 
was easier to sell to the Ameri­
can people and, quite frankly, 
would make the tax cut more 
likely to be enacted." 
The tax cut bill is the last 
piece of unfinished business in 
the Contract, and is expected 
to be the last item the House 
takes up this week before con­
cluding its 100-day agenda and 
leaving for its spring recess. 
The plan supported by the 
Republican leadership provides 
the child tax credit, expands 
individual retirement accounts, 
cuts the capital-gains tax rate 
paid on profits from invest­
ments and rolls back increased 
taxes on higher-income Social 
Security recipients. 
Democrats have proposed a 
far more modest plan costing 
$24 billion over five years and 
targeting educational benefits. 
Moderate Republicans and 
conservative Democrats also 
have argued that tax cuts 
should not take place without 
concrete progress in reducing 
the deficit. 
Gingrich said he and House 
Budget Committee Chairman 
John Kasich, R-Ohio, support 
that notion. "We think it is a 
good thing to keep locking 
Congress further and further 
into getting to a balanced bud­
get," he said. 
Republican leaders are now 
"having a little bit of an intra­
mural discussion" on the issue, he said, but predicted that they will come up with language stating that "if Congress do~s not adopt a budget that is in balance by 2002, then every­thing is off the table." 
On other items: 

•Gingrich 
p"redicted th~ term limits would be a major cam­paign issue next year and that a term-limit bill would be the first item on the agenda if Republicans retain power in Congress after the 1996 elec­tion. The House last week re­jected a constitutional amend­ment to limit the time mem­bers of Congress can serve. 

•He 
indicated that he would support a GOP plan to turn over to the states in block grants the $90 billion Washing­ton spends on Medicaid health care for the poor. "If you take all of the welfare-related health-care provisions, we think that the governors can run them better." 

•He 
said Congress would take up the issue of gays in the military. "We are probably go­ing to go back to the rules that existed prior to President Clin­ton changing them," he sai.;l.. Clinton changed the outright ban on homosexuals in the military to a less restrictive "don't ask, don't tell" policy. That policy is now being chal­lenged in the courts.

DETROIT 

Henry Cisneros wades into a throng of children at a dilapi­dated housing project and hears them describe their dream house -a place with large windows to let in the sun and warm basements in which· to play without fear of drug dealers and flying bullets. 
In a room filled with boards and plastic, the children are as­sembling a miniature design of what they would like their bedraggled Parkside housing complex to become. 
"We get tired of going to school and they say, 'Where y'alllive at is raggedy, you live in the projects with the rats and the roaches,"' a girl tells the federal housing secretary. 
What Cisneros doesn't tell the children is that $45 million to help pay for their dream has been sliced from his budget by Congress, that his department is fighting for its survival, and that he, in fact, is battling to keep his job amid a looming ethics investigation. 
With this in mind, Cisneros, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Develop­ment, later reflects: "This may be the last opportunity I have to be in public life ... I just want to do everything I can to make the biggest difference that I can."

A special prosecutor's inves­tigation into what Cisneros told the FBI about money he paid to a jilted lover years ago "has been mortifying and disappointing to many of my friends," he says in an inter­view during his visit to Detroit. 
"I helped her. I believe that was the right thing to do ­some people say it was not," he adds. " ... It's disconcerting that you believe in doing the right things, and even after having made terrible mistakes you try to make things right, but you can't get there." 
Aside from his personal prob­lems, Cisneros is facing an increasingly hostile Congress. 
His plan for overhauling HUD, which includes giving rent money directly to public housing residents in the form of vouchers, has received luke­warm reviews on Capitol Hill and a poor reception among the residents of HUD housing in cities such as Philadelphia and Boston. 
There is growing talk in Congress of eliminating his de­partment. 
He says he's determined to stay and President Clinton has given him his continued sup­port. 


''I'm going to fight on until I'm told, point blank, that I've got to go," he says, suggesting that his departure only would "contribute to ... (the) demise" of his public housing agenda. 
Cisneros has tried to drum up support in cities such as At­lanta, New York and most re­cently, Detroit. He talks of mak­ing HUD work better and trim­ming $13 billion over five years, hoping this will head off steeper reductions by Congress. 
In Detroit on March 23, Cis­neros spent the night at Park­side, sleeping on a sofa in the home of Linda Jackson and her two sons. He toured the city's "empowerment zone," aghast to see scores of apartment buildings, grand old houses, stores -even a former Cadillac factory, long aban­doned by General Motors ­boarded up. 
"What a shame it is to see the economic decline that has characterized this city," Cis­neros said. "Detroit's problem is an American problem. No country can afford to abandon its cities." 
But Cisneros said he knows Congress may one day pull the plug on HUD.

Palestinian militant killed 
By DONNA ABU-NASR 
Associated Press 
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip 

Islamic extremists preparing a· bomb set off an accidental blast Sunday that tore through their hideout. killing six people, inducting a top militant on Is­rael's most-wanted list. 
Angered by the explosion, PLO Chairman Vasser Arafat ordered an arrest sweep against Barnas, the group to which the militants belonged. 
"Hound them all up!" Arafat shouted at police commanders at his Gaza City headquarters. 
llamas blamed Israel and the PLO for the bombing and vowed "swift and painful" retaliation. The group has waged suicide and shooting attacks against Israel to thwart the 1993 peace agreement with the PLO. 
The 2:45 p.m. blast blew out the walls and gutted the sec­ond-floor apartment in the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood, a fundamentalist stronghold. A police bomb expert walked from the apartment clutching three canisters studded with nails, used to enhance a bomb's killing power. 

AP 
Fumes from a mysterious white powder, believed used to make bombs, overcame 40 peo­ple, including five policemen who fainted when a bag from the wrecked building was opened. 
"I was having a haircut. and I heard an explosion. It was louder than a Scud missile. I came running, and I found arms, hands and the head of a teen-aged boy," said Nidal Khadra, 16. 
Brig. Gen. Ghazi Jabali, head of PLO police in Gaza City, said the wrecked apartment amounted to "an explosives factory and an operations room for Hamas."

Six unexploded bombs, 150 grenades, a 22-pound rocket, two pistols and an Uzi subma­chine gun were recovered after the blast, Jabali said. He said the weapons came from south­ern Israel, and that letters were found written to Israelis warn­ing there would be attacks "inside and outside of Gaza." 
Also found were a plastic bag with 65 pounds of poisonous powder, mercuric oxide, and a hydroxide liquid believed used in making bombs, Jabali said. 
"This shows that those in the apartment had a total disre­gard for the lives of those living around them," Jabali said. 
A leaflet circulated by Hamas' military wing, Izzedine el Qassem, said members were hiding in the building. It denied they were preparing explosives and suggested Israel and the PLO had them planted. 
The bombing was "a joint op­eration of the Palestinian au­thority and the Zionist enemy," the leaflet said. 
Jabali listed six dead. Officials at Gaza's Shifa Hospital said a total of seven people were killed, including an 18-month-old baby, and two others were wounded. 
Among the victims was Ka­mal Ismail Hafez Kahil, 32, a leader of Izzedine al-Qassam. Kahil was near the top of Is­rael's most wanted list, blamed for a Dec. 24, 1993, shooting ambush that killed the highest­ranking Israeli to die during Is­rael's occupation of Gaza. 
Kahil also was linked to the slayings of at least 16 Palestini­ans accused of collaborating with Israel. 
He was known to wear an ex­plosive-laden belt around his waist, which he threatened to set ofT if capture was imminent.

Fighting intensified Sunday on several Bosnian battle­grounds, and the country's prime minister accused foreign governments of putting too lit­tle pressure on Serb rebels to accept a peace plan. 
U.N. peacekeepers confirmed fierce fighting in the Bihac en­clave, where forces of Bosnia's Muslim-led government were under attack from secessionist Muslims backed by Serbs from Bosnia and Croatia. 
"Almost the entire battle­front is in flames," Bosnian government radio said of the combat. 
Intense fighting occurred Sunday morning after Croatian Serbs put pressure on govern­ment forces southeast of Velika Kladusa, the headquarters of the rebel Muslims in the Bihac area, said a U.N. source who insisted on anonymity. 
Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic said the Muslim-led government, which has mount­ed major offensives over the past two weeks, would not con­sider further cease-fire talks unless the Serbs accepted an international peace plan. 
The plan would reduce Serb holdings from 70 percent to 49 percent of Bosnian territory. 
Silajdzic, quoted by Bosnian radio, said the international community seemed more in­terested in stabilizing the con­frontation lines than imple­menting the peace plan. 
The heaviest fighting re­ported by U.N. peacekeepers Sunday was in mountains near the northeast city of Tuzla where Serbs have been trying

to stop a broad government ad­vance. Government army sources said their troops had temporarily halted the offen­sive because of heavy snow. 
Government officers claimed four bombs were dropped by the Serbs near the town of Kalesija. southeast of Tuzla. The U.N. could not confirm the claim. 
In the U.N. protection zone in northwest Bosnia, several shells hit the village of Sokolac and at least 11 shells hit the town of Bihac, a U.N. spokesman said. It was the third day in a row of shelling there. 
Bosnian radio said 15 rounds of Serb artillery fire hit Bihac on Sunday afternoon, but there was no word of any casualties. 
In Sarajevo, snipers opened fire Sunday on worshipers en­tering and leaving a Roman Catholic church, but no injuries were reported. 
Peacekeepers said the gov­ernment's lone supply road into the city came under heavy Serb machine-gun fire several times Saturday, and one gov­ernment soldier reportedly was killed. 
A German relief agency worker who took a wrong turn into Bosnian Serb territory was in Serb detention Sunday at the Lukavica barracks on the southwest edge of Sarajevo, 
U.N. spokesman Kris Janowski said late Sunday night. 
The worker, 36-year-old Ludwig Kraus, had set out in a jeep Saturday from Sarajevo for a round-trip to a town about 12 miles to the west. 
An American and four French drivers in a convoy for the charity Pharmacists With­out Borders were detained in early March after similarly making a wrong turn. They also are held by the Serbs at Lukavica, accused of supplying goods to the Bosnian govern­ment army. 
In Croatia, meanwhile, the Orthodox church in the historic port of Dubrovnik was dam­aged when a hand grenade was thrown at it, the Belgrade­based Tanjug news agency said Sunday. 
The incident occurred overnight between Thursday and Friday, Tanjug said.

U of M, UNC let students run campus organizations 

By ANGELA PETRUCCI 
News Writer 
Georgetown and Duke Uni­versities, both private institu­tions, have distinct differences in each school's regulation of its student publications and organizations. 
Student Publications 
According to Francine Freidman, editor-in-chief of Georgetown's newspaper the Hoya, there are relatively few restrictions placed on what goes into the paper. 
Freidman said that there are really no obstructions as to the subject matter of their articles and that with ads, the Hoya fol­lows the ad policy that it estab­lished for itself. 
This policy excludes ads that are pornographic or that are for Pro-Choice organizations. Freidman explained funds for the Hoya are made with the publication of ads so that the paper is financially self-suffi­cient. 
However, the Hoy a is still a member of the school's Media Board. This board approves a budget every year for the pa­per. 
With the exception of the school's newspaper, twelve publications at Duke University are regulated by the Duke Student Publications Board, made up of the editors of each publication as well as represen­tatives from the student gov­ernment, the faculty and the administration. 
The different publications are funded by the student govern­ment; however, the government gives the board a block grant and it is up to the board to allo­cate the money to each publi­cation. 
Chairman of the Publications 
Board Mike Arlein explained 
that the boards main concern is 
for legal matters such as pos­
sible libel or slander. The ma­
terial that goes into the 
publications is not read by the 
board prior to publication. 
Therefore, according to Arlein, 
the responsibility of censorship 
is up to the individual editor 
who is completely responsible 
for what gets printed in their 
publication. 
The Chronicle, Duke Uni­
versity's student newspaper, is 
independently incorporated so 
it is not controlled by the 
University's administration. It 
became independently incorpo­
rated about a year ago. 
Because of its independence, any censorship that takes place occurs within the organization itself and not from an outside group. 
The Chronicle is funded by ad sales and receives no funding from the university. The paper, by being independent, has total control over what it wishes to publish with the only censor­ship being self-censorship and censorship by the editors. 
Student radio stations 
The decisions at WGTB, the radio station at Georgetown are usually left to its general man­ager. General Manager Shan Vosseller explained that "there is a gray area" as to what their restrictions are. The station must comply to the general guidelines of the university in terms of conduct but in terms of content, it is unrestricted. 
The media board also funds the station, but it does not de­cide what will go on the air. Such decisions are left up to the station. Also. the station is only broadcast on the campus, so it does not have to comply to FCC regulations and, because of this, they are fairly free to say what they want over the air. 
The radio station at Duke, WXDU-Durham, really has no set restrictions, assistant sta­tion manager Krishna Upadyha said. She said that the station's mission is "to play music that won't be played anywhere else." Therefore, they have a wide variety of programs from jazz to bluegrass. However, what will be played is up to the individual disc-jockey. 
Since the radio station is a FM 
station, it must comply with 
FCC regulations and, according 
to Upadyha, WXDU follows all 
of the guidelines set by the FCC. 
The station is funded mostly by 
the university with an occa­
sional sponsorship from outside 
groups for certain shows 
played on the air. 
The station does not play any 
commercials although it some­
times plays public service an­
nouncements. Be-cause of this, 
they are less susceptible to out­
side influence and control. 
Student organizations 
With regard to the formation 
of student clubs, there is a very 
involved process that students 
must go through to form one at 
Georgetown. 
Andrew Martin, the chair of 
the Student Activities 
Commission, said that the clubs essentially start from students who find other interested peo­ple to form a club. The mini­mum membership for a club is twelve members. 

Students must meet with the Director of Student Programs, who informs the students of how they get access to policy benefits and helps them estab­lish a constitution that under­lines all the guidelines for the club. 
The club then goes before the Student Activities Commission with its constitution to get it ap­proved and to obtain access to policy benefits. Each club must submit a budget every year to receive funding, and it is re­sponsible for acquiring other partial funding through dues and other fundraising activities. 
The administration's involve­ment in such organizations is carried out through the Office of Student Programs. Each club additionally has a faculty advi­sor whose extent of in­volvement varies from club to club. 
The types of clubs that are re­stricted from forming "are any club that is derogatory to one's ethnicity or culture, any frater­nity or other secret organiza­tion, any club that promotes violence, and any clubs that do not follow the standards of a Jesuit education," Martin ex­plained. 
Although there are relatively few restrictions placed on the formation of clubs, the univer­sity's Jesuit education philoso­phy does limit some club from establishing. 
Duke presently has about 165 different clubs and organiza­tions on its campus. 
According to John Tolsma, president of Duke Student Government, in order for a group to form it must first come before the student government and receive approval. From there, they must write a consti­tution under the supervision of a faculty member and then go before the student legislature. 
The clubs receive their fund­

ing through student govern­
ment and they have to submit a 
budget which must go through 
the legislature first. 
If approved, the club receives 
Duke's names and privileges so 
that it can receive funding. The 
extent of the administration's 
in-volvement includes the 
requirement of each club to 
have a faculty advisor. Each 
club must also comply with all 
the rules of the university. 

ByTIMGREEN News Writer 
At public schools such as the University of Michigan and the University of North Carolina, there is very little regulation of student groups and organizations by their school's administrations. 
At both Michigan and North Carolina, the recognition of any student groups comes from the student governments of the schools. 
Michigan's Student Assembly considers any group which comes before it for recogni­tion. There are no restrictions placed on the type of groups that can be recognized. The only qualification is that the students must show proof of a certain number of students who will .be involved with the group and a basic statement of the or-ganization's purpose. Once recognized, student groups may be allocated funds from the Student Assembly for their operation. 
Similarly, student groups at North Carolina are recognized by the school's Student Congress. However, the pro­cess of obtaining recognition at UNC is very simple and only involves the niling out of cer­tain forms. The groups must state their mission and have their group name entered into university ftles. All groups are funded through student fees. 
The campus newspaper at Michigan, the Michigan Daily, is funded only through adver­tisement sales and a yearly endowment, allowing it to operate independently of the university administration. 
According to editors at the Daily, there is no direct con­tact with the administration. The only connection between the students at the paper and the school's administrators is a legal agreement that pro­hibits lawsuits from either party against the other. The paper is not under any ad~in­istrative obligation concermng the material that is or is not printed. 
At North Carolina, the Daily Tarheel is completely indepen­dent as well. Funding comes from advertisement sales and student fees, and due to this, there is no regulation of the paper by the administration.

• RIGHT OR WRONG?  

University could use a little Courage in its policy 

Vice President O'Hara's response (Observer, March 6) explaining her proper denial of recognition to GLND/SMC prompts a few observations. 
The O'Hara response notes the University's intent to regard "our gay and lesbian students as integral and val­ued members of the Notre Dame com­munity." The new Catechism makes a similar point: "[M]en and women who have deep-seated homosexual tenden­cies .... do not choose their homosexual condition, for most of them it is a trial. 
Charles Rice 


They must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. These persons are called to fulfill God's will in their lives and, if they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord's Cross the diffi­culties they may encounter from their condition." No. 2358. 
Vice-President O'Hara has appointed a committee to advise her on how "we can do a better job of meeting the needs of our gay and lesbians students." But that committee is a non-starter because the University has already capitulated on the decisive issue of whether the homo­sexual orientation is a disorder. 
Notre Dame denies recognition to GLND/SMC because that group espoused, in O'Hara's words, "a value­neutral approach toward a variety of ways in which gays and lesbians may live out their orientation [and] stated its belief that Notre Dame has a unique opportunity to influence young gays and lesbians by steering them in the direc­tion of stable, monogamous relation­ships. Neither of these approaches is

consistent with official Church teach­ings." 
This position echoes the mandate of the 198 Letter on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons, issued with the approval of John Paul II, that "No authentic pastoral program will include organizations in which persons associ­ate with each other without clearly stat­ing that homosexual activity is immoral. A truly pastoral approach will appreci­ate the need for homosexual persons to avoid the near occasions of sin." No. 15. 
Notre Dame affirms its responsibility, as O'Hara states, "to remain faithful to the teachings of the Catholic Church." However the Church teaches not only that homosexual acts are wrong but also that, as the 1986 Letter put it, "[a]lthough the particular inclination of the homosexual person is not a sin, it is a more or less strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil and thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder." No. 3 
While it affirms Catholic teaching that homosexual acts are immoral, Notre Dame contradicts, in words and implica­tions, the essential teachings on the dis­order of the homosexual inclination. Vice-President O'Hara describes the Counseling Center as one of the "valu­able resources" available to homosexual students. But Dr. Patrick Utz, director of the Counseling Center, believes that "being homosexual is not a disorder." Observer, Feb. 10, p.11. Moreover, as far as I know, no public statement by the University affirms the Catholic teaching on both points, not only that homosexual acts are wrong but also that the homosexual inclination is disor­dered. This omission implies that the inclination is not disordered or that its status is irrelevant. 
Neither element of the teaching can be denied without undermining the other. If, as the Counseling Center says, the homosexual condition is not a disorder, there is no intrinsic reason why it should not be acted upon. Any student-client with even a single-digit LSAT could fig­ure that one out. 
The University's message that the inclination is not disordered nullifies its professed adherence to the teaching that homosexual acts are wrong. Instead of fully presenting to its students the hope­filled teaching of the Church, Notre Dame leads them through an exercise in cognitive dissonance which will incline them to see the prohibition of homosex­ual acts not as rooted in nature and the wisdom of God but as an arbitrary edict of celibate clerical authority. 
This misdirection of the students takes on added significance in light of the cul­tural war in which the general homosex­ual movement uses the media, schools and churches to validate the homosexu­al condition and lifestyles. The 1986 Letter noted that "increasing numbers of people today, even within the church, are bringing enormous pressure to bear on the church to accept the homosexual condition as though it were not disor­dered and to condone homosexual activ­ity. 
Those within the church who argue in 
'In the context of this cul­
tural war, Notre Dame ... has a special duty to present its students the full teaching of the Church.' 
this fashion often have close ties with those with similar views outside it. These latter groups are guided by a vision opposed to the truth about the human person, which is fully disclosed in the mystery of Christ. They reflect, even if not entirely consciously, a mate­rialistic ideology which denies the tran­scendent nature of the human person as well as the supernatural vocation of every individual... The movement within the church, which takes the form of pressure groups of various names and sizes. attempts to give the impression that it represents all homosexual per­sons who are Catholics. 

As a matter of fact, its membership is by and large restricted to those who either ignore the teaching of the church or seek somehow to undermine it. It brings together under the aegis of Catholicism homosexual persons who have no intention of abandoning their homosexual behavior. One tactic used is to protest that any and all criticism of or reservations about homosexual people, their activity and lifestyle are simply diverse forms of unjust discrimination." Nos. 8 and 9. 
In the context of this cultural war, Notre Dame, as the most visible "Catholic" University, has a special duty to present. to its students the full teach­ing of the Church. 
Let me offer a suggestion. In 1980, Father John F. Harvey, OSFS, founded Courage, a nationwide support group for homosexuals, sponsored by the Archdiocese of New York and endorsed by the Pontifical Council on the Family. Courage helps homosexual men and women to live in accord with the teach­ing of the Church. "The psychology is that some people can change, and if they can't, they can still lead a chaste life," Father Harvey says. "The theology is that you've got to avoid this kind of activity." 
Father Harvey spoke at Notre Dame in 1991 and said that any "organization whose explicit purpose is to foster chaste friendships among homosexuals should be encouraged and recognized." He said he would like to start a Courage Chapter at Notre Dame. Observer, Nov. 6, 1991, p.l. 
The Notre Dame position on GLND/SMC is fatally flawed. But we don't need another committee to assem­ble another unreadable report. Maybe we just need Father Harvey and Courage (in lower as well as upper case). 
Professor Rice is on the Law School faculty. His column appears every other Monday.

• AT THE MOVIES WITH fAT MAN AND DADDY 
Cinemark right on target 
Fatman and Daddy explore the latest edi­tion to the cultural mecca ofSouth Bend, Cinemark Theaters. 
O
n a blustery Friday evening, two well-built gentlemen strolled 
towards a large building with a 

sense of purpose and duty. These two men shouldered a large responsibility: they had been entrusted to give thou­sands the lowdown on the new kid in town, Cinemark Theaters. This was a .task that many would refuse in a heartbeat and it was a job that promised to be both physically taxing and incredibly dangerous. However, 
our heroes were undaunted by this 
unavoidable truth. Why? The answer 
is simple. The Patman and Daddy live 
for a challenge. 
Daddy: The building that houses the 
Cinemark Theaters is a visual spectacle 
guaranteed to delight the eyes. 
Flashing lights and large marquees 
combine to form a beacon directing 
attention to what is undoubtedly a cine­
ma oasis in the South Bend desert of 
dank and smelly theaters. Entranced 
by its sheer majesty, a sense of eupho­
ria consumed my otherwise melancholy 
demeanor and I found myself grabbing 
the Patman's hand and gleefully skip­
ping towards the movie house's gate to 
entertainment. 
Once inside, my enthusiasm was not diminished; Cinemark Theaters is as aesthetically gaudy on the inside as it is on the exterior. Hues of purple, green ·and orange tickled my optical senses and generally overwhelmed a man who one day dreams of living in a pink stuc­co adobe. Inside, the ticket vendors were as pleasant as quaint plebeians can be; thus, the purchase of your pass-

es sets a general tone of happiness that can only enhance the viewing of a good picture. 
The only facets of this theater that pricked my mental balloon of joy were the complimentary booster seats that sat ominously by the doors. While such services suggest that the Cinemark is a family-friendly environment, they simultaneously encourage the presence of children. This fact worries Daddy because it is only obvious that kids who need booster chairs to see the screen are more than likely to be the same components of the audience that whine, kick, scream and cry their way to the destruction of an enjoyable cinema experience. 
On a concluding note, Daddy would like to compliment the culinary genius­es who created the eclectic menu at the theater's snack bar. Believe it or not, hungry customers can purchase the time honored movie treat of pickles at the Cinemark! Knowing full well that nothing remains to be said that could possibly eclipse the importance and salty goodness of these briny delicacies, let Daddy recommend that all future viewings occur at the Cinemark Theaters. 
Fatman: There it stood briskly in the South Bend night: lights aglow, fancy cars parked inside newly painted yel­low lines, and legions of prepubescents scurrying around holding hands. The Cinemark is a 20th century architectur­al masterpiece. Mega-food bar. video game center, urine-free bathroom floors, and elderly employees abound. The fecundity and magnificence of the theater cannot be contained. Cinemark, a glorious symbol of fifties design and Hollywood spectacle. 

Normally, the Patman lunges towards the concession stand when he enters a local theater. But when you enter the Cinemark, a strange set of cacophonous sounds and queer lights draws your attention towards the money draining video game center. Packed with pinball machines, video games, and tickets for claiming neat toy animals, the room immediately forces you to relinquish a ·couple of bucks to its coffer. Here, Daddy and I partook of a wrestling match, which I unfairly lost because the flashing lights shining from the ceiling distracted my concentration and Daddy took the opportunity to make his man, Kyle the Irrational, smother my master wrestler, Julius the Rodent. 
The actual theater allowed for good 
viewing of the film. The roomy chairs 
supported my substantial girth and a 
nifty drink holder cradled my beverage. 
Life was good in the theater. The 
atmosphere echoed the overall nostal­
gic feel of the place and there was none 
of that sticky, "I hope Paul Rubens 
wasn't here," stuff on the floor. The 
sound system worked well enough, 
though on this particular screen it was 
not THX. 
Maybe the most appealing aspect of 
Cinemark is the tight security. On the 
way out, a true blue St. Joseph county 
policeman made sure all the little kid­
dies were behaving. He asked Daddy 
and I for our autographs and opinions 
on the show. but we scorned his petty 
bourgeois pretensions-after all, we 
had just seen "Exotica." 
Cinemark offers South Bend and 
Notre Dame a wider variety of films. 
No longer will overblown major releas­
es from major studios monopolize the 
local movie market. The theater 
promises to keep smaller releases and 
less mainstream productions coming 
into town. It will provide the staple 
films as well. The Cinemark pushes 
South Bend over the top as the nation's 
premiere social and cultural mecca ­
we've made the big time, ladies and 
gentlemen. 
Exotica: More than meets the eye 
Exotica 
****
out of four 

e erotic dance club, Exotica, serves its clientele with 
lass and style. But the D.J. is jealous of his ex-girl­
friend's nightly table performances for a middle-aged man named Francis. Connections with the past. involving murder, sibling betrayal. and a search for a dead body haunt all of the main characters. Relationships unfold and tensions build as the characters vie for each others love and attention. 
Fatman: Few distinctions in art are as difficult to make as the articulation of the difference between gratuitous sex and eroticism. Most films clutter themselves with the former, while very few can obtain the latter. Granted, gratuitous sex has its place and utility, but eroticism moves beyond the nor­mal sweaty, steamy love scene and embraces a different aspect of physical beauty. "Exotica" manages to create erotic imagery, both hetero and homosexual, which gives healthy meaning to the story. 
Nudity is not a voyeuristic, sexual stimulation in the film; it is a means of healing and coping with the past. The charac­ters possess odd but human dysfunctions and the manner in which they deal with their lives is through the language of the body. They speak through the dances and long gazes that fill the movie. The main character, Francis, says more with his stagnant eyes than any of the words that come from his mouth. His relationship to the childlike dancer, Christine, is conducted through her dances and his silence is broken only by mutterings. Two way mirrors appear throughout the movie and the interplay between the people on both sides reveals aspects of the characters than no amount of dialogue is capa­ble of supplying. "Exotica" is about different ways of commu­nication, among other themes, and it manages to deal with them in a sophisticated manner that few recent films have been able to do. It argues that a connection between other people through whatever form of language one prefers is a source of healing and redemption. 
The characters, yoked to their pasts, seek relief by sublating 
their memories and coming to terms with the present. Dance, 
gazing, touching, and meaningful conversations are the in­
struments needed for severing the chain that connects them 
with their pasts. So, for the Fatman , the constant play of 
unspoken words is what made the film work. Plus, since I 
have dedicated my life to the corporeal pleasures of this saucy 
world, how could the Fatman not enjoy a movie like "Exotica"? 
Daddy: Due to the inherently invisible nature of Hollywood cinematic style, movie audiences are rarely treated to films that can both entertain narratively while simultaneously pleasing the visual senses. "Exotica" is the first film Daddy has seen in a long time that delivers an intriguing story with­out completely subjecting form to function. Rather, this particular film combines both components (which are intrinsic factors in the production of a decent final print) seamlessly and thus creates an artistic masterpiece. From its editing to its panties, "Exotica" is fllled with French cutting and a myr­iad of other splicing and framing tricks that compliment what is already a strong and suspenseful story. 
Suspense is the key word in any discussion of "Exotica." Contrary to the majority of the other mystery movies Daddy has been privileged to see, this picture withholds the resolu­tion of its enigmas until the very end itself. This process insures that its audiences are constantly engaged in a person­al investigation that cannot be carried through to a satisfying degree of fruition until the fmal credits roll. It is this mystery that makes "Exotica" so entertaining (well, the exotic dancing doesn't really hurt either). The puzzle remains fresh and true to itself which keeps this movie from degenerating to the level of a silly action movie where bullets and bloodshed only serve to illustrate the obvious. 
The main reason behind Daddy's desire to see "Exotica" had almost nothing to do with its saucy title and promises of skin. Daddy wanted to see "Exotica" because of its background and the awards that it brings with it to the big screen, notably the Directors's Award at the Cannes Film Festival. I naturally fig­ured that with such prestigious credentials "Exotica" could only be fantastic. Why does Daddy place so much importance in the words and deeds of the Festival's panel of judges? The answer to this query is two-fold. First, Cannes named "Pulp Fiction" as last year's best movie offering. Secondly, the French found "Forrest Gump" as clever and cute as Euro­Disney; while equating Tom Hanks' acting talents with those of the big, stupid mouse who takes your tickets at the door of that same fun park. Cannes fails to disappoint and deceive once more. I must agree with my French brethren when I take my hat off to "Exotica" and implore the peons at home to go and see it.

• MUSIC CRITIC 
NAZZ'95 


T
he smoke machine was working overtime, the crowd was roaring, and the judges were fresh and ready to watch fifteen bands battle it out in the architectural masterpiece of Stepan Center. It was 1995. It was NAZZ. And it was going to be a long night. 
The 1995 edition proved to be full of talent and loaded with a broad scope of music. The first two bands suffered due to problems with monitors and the PA system but still managed to open this year's edition of NAZZ with a bang. Throughout the evening, the crowd rolled in and out like the tide, with large groups entering and exiting with each change of performers. All told, the bal­lots were tallied and the winner was announced after five and a half hours of music. 
Vic Kevlar 

·Being the first band was a difficult task well handled by this band who kicked off NAZZ with a solid mix of songs. Their unique brand of music was well received by the crowd, who at this point numbered in the forties. Vic Kevlar exhibited a tight sound filled with a great deal of energy, variation and bits of feedback complementing their heavy tone. 
QED 

Musically, QED was the most talented. However, their brand of 80's Van Halen I Hush arena rock hindered them in the final tabulation of votes due to its lack of popularity today. Opening with a great rendition of Emerson, Lake and Palmer's "Karn Evil 9" and moving into two originals of sonic boom proportions demonstrated this band's talent. It was disappointing, though, to see a band this good, who has a CD coming out, have to play a cover song, even though its lyrics were appropriate. 
The Lennard Jones Potential Ay Carumba! Who would have ever thought that a band would play Nena's "99 Luftballoons," let alone in Deustch? Enter The Lennard Jones Potential. With their simple sound and female singer they had a large appeal to the still sparse crowd with Nena definitely the highlight of their set. After being blown away by QED, the quieter sound of The

Music Critic 

Lennard Jones Potential was much appreciated. This group was both tal­ented and, as their name entails, full of potential. 
Tweak 
"I've been tweaked!" This trio was my "second place" finisher. Their twangy guitars complimented the vocals while their drummer made a huge impact by steering away from "just keeping the beat." Playing all originals, including the funky "Gray Man" and the sinister "Red," helped make a major impact on the crowd. By this time the sound tech­nicians corrected the previous PA prob­lems and Tweak took advantage of this by closing their set with a bang. 
True North 
The evening's second place finisher, True North was the early crowd favorite. With the encouragement of the band, the growing crowd began to dance and groove. Playing one hell of a rendi­tion of Jimi Hendrix's "Crosstown Traffic" helped to turn NAZZ up a notch. True North came with their game faces on and were by far the most into their music up to this point, especially their lead singer who had an incredible stage presence and also a great pelvic thrust, complimenting the rockin' funk blasted out by his band mates. 
Spoonfed
Self-proclaimed agoraphobic band, Spoonfed urged the crowd to come up on stage in hopes of turning Stepan into a basement atmosphere. Even if only two people took them up on this offer, they still produced this personal ambiance by generating tons of energy through their music. It appeared that they would trash their instruments after their first song, with harsh choruses and a thrashing sound. A quick glance to the front of Stepan saw people standing in awe of this great band whose music made its presence felt. 
Krautmiser 
"Image is everything" was the key in describing this band. Their fabulous stage presence added to the superb funk which got the crowd moving again. Like True North, these guys really seemed to be having a great time, especially singer Dave McMahon whose dancing around 

The Observer/ Jacob Bump 
Sweep the Leg Johnny keeps the crowd roaring with an unforgettable set. 
made the experience all the more mem­orable. Playing all originals, including my personal favorite "Black Bombay" and filling the gaps between songs with witty remarks, this band made it into my top three. 
The Roadapples

Last year's champs and the most anticipated, they certainly didn't disap­point with their great brand of rock which had the largest group of people dancing and screaming all night. Like a finely tuned machine, this band drove the energy level up a notch with their inspiring set. When their time limit was rapidly approaching, they kicked into an amazing version of Suzanne Vega's "Luka" receiving a great response from the crowd. They definitely lived up to my expectations as defending champs even though the judges didn't agree. 
decaf 

The Roadapples were a tough act to follow, especially after the mass exodus of fans following their performance, but decaf took it all in stride and provided a great blend of alternative and hard rock. With tons of distortion and loud drums, their music was powerful. However, be­cause of the volume overkill, the lyrics were incoherent. Otherwise, though, decaf put on a great set of solid, compe­tent music. 
Sabor Latino 

It's about time that this campus took notice of this incredible band. I'm in awe whenever I see them because I can't be­lieve that 12 people can collaborate to play music so effortlessly and mistake­free. After decaf, Sabor Latino was a welcome change of pace, giving every­one's ears a rest. Truly a crowd favorite and a class act, they maringed, salsa-ed and Cha Cha-ed throughout their set. I didn't understand a single lyric, but who cares? They were awesome, as was evi­dent in the judges first place decision. 
Sweep the Le~ Johnny

This highTy anticipated performance by STLJ was not a disappointment. They really, REALLY got into their music, dri­ving home a powerful, awesome, unfor­gettable set. It's no wonder that they were out of tune by the end of their sec­ond song with guitarist Christopher Daly flailing around on stage and hammering out chords. STLJ was my personal favorite out of all the bands, keeping the energy level at its peak and drawing a great response from the crowd. 
George and the Freeks 

Another crowd favorite, GATF, didn't disappoint. They are a band that likes to jam and they proved it on Friday night. Playing three songs that seemed to go on for an eternity was beneficial to them because they gave the crowd lots of time to dance and have a great time. Winning the hearts of the judges and taking third place, the well reputed GATF lived up to the expectations of all. 
Big Earl 

Big Earl received a huge response when they took the stage in the dwin­dling hours of the night; a time when two judges had already gone MIA and others were getting anxious for NAZZ to come to a close. They wailed out their heavy blues rock and jammed, much to the pleasure of their huge following. With great guitar solos and awesome harmonica, Big Earl captured third place in my mind, but, once again the judges didn't agree. 
Sunshine Wine 
"Two more to go!" After five hours of ear blistering music and a handful of cold chicken wings stolen from the judges table, I was getting restless. Sunshine Wine took the stage and really surprised me. Formerly a Dead sound-a­like, they have made a drastic change in switching to a funkadelic sound which was really impressive. Lacking the ener­gy of say Krautmiser, the fact that it was 1:15 in the morning was not benefi­cial to them. However, they still man­aged to put on a really good show and prove that they are a quality band. 
Glamoras Glues 
Wow! If you weren't there to see these guys, it's impossible to explain their set. Arriving on stage with tinfoil wrapped sacs over their heads and going off on a huge monologue to introduce the band and their origins (Venus or something), the Glamoras Glues could only make you laugh. But, once they got through the theatrics (not impressing two judges who got up and left halfway through), ·­they played decent music with a really loud touch to it. One thing is for certain, they fit into the spacey atmosphere pro­vided by the architectural nightmare known as Stepan Center and, in the same way Vic Kevlar opened the show, closed with a bang. 
Approaching the five and a half hour mark, the judges votes were quickly tab­ulated by the SUB representatives and the winners were announced. The oper­ative statement here is that "bigger is better" with all the top three bands con­sisting of at least six people. Taking third was George and the Freeks. Second place went to the funk based True North and the Grand Prize went, surprisingly but not unwarranted, to Sabor Latino. All in all, it was an enjoy­able evening of diverse music that exposed some great bands. There were many memorable moments and also some easily forgettable ones, but over­all, it was a great time.

Barkley tallies 45, but Suns fall to Spurs 
By WENDY E. lANE 
Associated Press 
SAN ANTONIO 

David Robinson hit two free throws with 20.7 seconds remaining and the San Antonio Spurs overcame Charles Barkley's season-high 45 points to win their 11th straight Sunday, beating the Phoenix Suns 109-106. 
The Spurs improved to 52-18, the best record in the Western Conference, and extended their lead over Utah in the Midwest to 1 1/2 games. 
San Antonio took a 103-94 lead on Chuck Person's 3-pointer with 2:54 remaining, but the Suns answered with a layup by Barkley and a 3-pointer by Danny Ainge -Phoenix's 10th of the game -to trim their deficit to four with 
2:06 to play. 
After Sean Elliott, who finished with 30 points, hit a 19-footer, Kevin Johnson scored two baskets for Phoenix to cut it to 105-103. 
After Robinson's free throws, Barkley missed an open 12-footer, and Wesley Person sent Elliott to the line with 13.7 seconds left, where he sank both foul shots to seal the win. 
Ainge hit another 3-pointer with 2.2 seconds left for the Suns' final basket. 
Barkley, who missed his career high by two points, made 17 of 27 shots and had 10 rebounds. Johnson added 16 points and 10 assists. 
Robinson, in foul trouble most of the game, finished with 23 points and 14 rebounds, but scored just four in the final period while playing with five fouls. His 14 rebounds contributed to the Spurs 46-36 rebounding advantage and helped the Spurs win their eighth straight since Dennis Rodman, the NBA's leading rebounder, separated his shoulder in a motorcycle accident. 
The Spurs, who have never finished first in their conference, play eight of their fmal12 games on the road, includ­ing a four-game Pacific Division swing that begins Tuesday at the Los Angeles Clippers. 
Phoenix, which was starting a five­game road trip, lost for the fourth time in six games. 
Barkley had a season high before the third quarter ended, leading a 14-0 run that turned a 74-67 deficit into a 81-74 lead with 2:17 left in the period. The Suns made 14 of 22 field goal attempts in the period, but Robinson hit a 3­pointer at the buzzer to send the Spurs into the final period with a 84-84 tie. 
Where the Spurs missed Rodman this time was on defense. Without Rodman on him, Barkley had 27 first-half points on 9-for-14 shooting. 
Barkley pulled Phoenix even on a 3­pointer with 10:08 left in the first half before the Spurs went on a 15-3 run and took a 48-36 led on Person's 3-pointer. 
The Suns hit three treys in the final three minutes to cut San Antonio's advantage to 55-51 at halftime. 
Richard Dumas missed the game for the Suns due to a urinary tract infection. 
Pistons 110, Bullets 105 
AUBURN HILLS, Mich. 
Joe Dumars scored 22 of his 23 points in the second half, helping the Detroit Pistons beat Washington 110-105 Sunday, the Bullets' seventh straight loss. 
Detroit also got 33 points from rookie Grant Hill, equalling his career high, and 30 from Allan Houston. Chris Webber had 30 for Washington. 
Washington led 50-44 at halftime, and although Detroit fought back to tie the score 57-57, the Bullets surged ahead 79-68 late in the period. 
But Detroit scored the final seven 
points, including a Dumars 3-pointer at 
the buzzer, and trailed by only four after 
three periods. 
Detroit kept coming, and a Terry Mills jumper gave the Pistons an 87-86 lead with 7:llleft. 
The Pistons started to pull away, and a Houston 3-pointer made it 104-95 with 
2:12 left. But Webber and Rex Chapman hit consecutive 3-pointers to pull Washington within three in the final minute. 
Then, Dumars hit a baseline jumper with 21 seconds to go, and hit four free throws in the fmal seven seconds. 
The win was only the third in 12 games for Detroit. 
Neither team led by more than four points in the first quarter, which ended 28-28. Hill had 12 points in the quarter and Houston 9, while Gheorge Muresan had 10 points and six rebounds for Washington. 
Detroit took a 37-33 lead early in the second, but Washington answered with an 11-1 run to go ahead by six, a mar­gin it held at halftime. 
Hill had 20 points at the half and Houston 14. 
Knicks 94, Nets 85 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. 
Despite the first-half ejection of Patrick Ewing, the New York Knicks outscored the New Jersey Nets 33-11 in the final 15 minutes Sunday to post a 94-85 vic­tory. 
Ewing and New Jersey's Rick Mahorn were ejected after shoving each other just before halftime. New York's Derek Harper and the Nets' Benoit Benjamin were thrown out late in the game in sep­arate incidents. 
The Knicks got 26 points from John Starks, including seven of the team's 12 3-pointers. Hubert Davis added 17, including eight in a 14-0 run that gave New York the lead for good. 
Kenny Anderson finished with 31 for New Jersey, but only two came in the final quarter when the Nets made only four field goals. Armon Gilliam added 22 and 16 rebounds. 
It was the third straight win for the Knicks and the fourth consecutive loss for the Nets, who played without injured star Derrick Coleman. 

New Jersey, which blew a 15-point second-half lead in a loss to Portland last Thursday, led by 16 in this one fol­lowing a tip-in by Gilliam with 4:49 left in the third quarter. 
The margin was still 13 when Chris Childs of New Jersey missed two free throws with 3:07 left in the quarter, but the Knicks scored the final eight points, with Starks and Davis each hitting a 3­pointer. 
The Nets stretched the lead to 79-72 on a basket by Jayson Williams with 
7:28 to go, but the Knicks scored the next 14 points. Davis scored eight of the first nine points in the spurt, including a 3-pointer that gave New York an 81-79 edge with 5:13 left. 
A 3-pointer by Harper and a jumper by Charles Oakley stretched the lead to 86­79 with 3:25 remaining, and the Nets never got closer than five points the rest of the way. 
Ewing and Mahorn were ejected with 
1:06 left in the first half. 
Ewing was angry at Mahorn after being knocked to the floor by an elbow in the ribs two possessions earlier, and the two came together shortly after a basket by Anderson. 
SuperSonics 105, Hawks 83 

TACOMA, Wash. 
Gary Payton scored nine of his 21 points in the fourth quarter and Shawn Kemp finished with 21 points and 18 rebounds Sunday, powering the Seattle SuperSonics to a 105-83 victory over the Atlanta Hawks. 
The Sonics won their seventh straight, and their victory combined with San Antonio's 109-106 decision over Phoenix vaulted Seattle into first place in the Pacific Division. The Sonics swept the Hawks for the first time since the 1987­88 season.

UConn finishes perfect, defeats Tennessee 

By CHUCK SCHOFFNER 
Associated Press 
MINNEAPOLIS 

With its final victory in a magical season, Connecticut achieved something rare in NCAA women's basketball ­perfection. 
Top-ranked Connecticut capped an unbeaten season by defeating No. 3 Tennessee 70­64 Sunday to win the national championship. The Huskies (35-0) pulled it off despite the foul problems of their top three players and despite trailing by nine points early in the second half. 
Only one other team has got­ton through a season without losing in the 14 years of NCAA women's basketball. Texas won the 1986 title with a 34-0 record. 
Defense also was critical to the Huskies, who held Tennessee (34-3) without a field goal after Tiffani Johnson's three-point play put the Lady Vols ahead 61-59 with 4:09left. 
Jamelle Elliott hit a double­pump layup to tie the score at 61 with 2:20 to play and Jennifer Hizzotti's layup with

title at the free throw line, with player of the year Rebecca Lobo making four and Rizzotti and Carla Berube sinking two apiece. 
For the longest time, it appeared that Tennessee would fullfill the promise of a season that began with the Lady Vols ranked No. 1, a position they held until losing to UConn 77­66 in mid-January. 
Lobo, 6-foot-7 Kara Wolters and Hizzotti all got into foul trouble in the first half and spent long stretches on the bench. But Connecticut played through its problems and sent Tennessee, a three-time na­tional champion, back home as a frustrated loser. 
After Berube made the first of her two free throws with 9. 9 seconds left, Tennessee coach Pat Summitt slammed her hand down on the scorer's table and groaned, "I really hate this." 
·Moments later. the Connecticut players were hug­ging each other and crying at midcourt and Tennessee was walking dejectedly to its dress­ing room. 
Lobo led all scorers with 17 points after playing only eight minutes in the first half and was named the Final Four's outstanding player. Rizzotti scored 15 points, Elliott 13 and Wolters 10. 
Latina Davis was Tennessee's only double-figure scorer with 11 points. Dana Johnson had nine and All-American Nikki McCray scored only seven.

Of course, Notre Dame's sweep of Butler was merely a "been there, done that" thing after they brought out the brooms against Wright State on Saturday, notching 7-6 and 8-0 wins.

Johnson then converted her three-point play to give Tennessee its last lead. 
A key was Tennessee being unable to take control in the first half when Connecticut got into foul problems. 
Lobo sat out the final 11:58 of the half after getting her third foul, Wolters spent 3:50 on the bench after getting her second and Rizzotti spent the final 4:51 on the sidelines with three fouls. But the Lady Vols never got up by more than six. 
Down by seven points early, Tennessee got its first lead of the game after Lobo left, going up 21-20 on Marciniak's back­door layup with 9:51 left. Davis hit a 3-pointer from the right corner to put the Lady Vols up 26-23 and they led 36-30 after Abby Conklin's 3-pointer with a minute to play. 
After Wolters scored on an offensive rebound, reserve Laurie Mulligan answered for Tennessee with a leaning jump shot just before the buzzer to restore the six-point lead.

other in a long line of gems, al­lowing one-hit and going the full seven innings against the Raiders. 
Once again, the winning run was scored by Meghan Murray who scored on Andy Keys' fourth inning single. 
The second game was far more exciting as the Irish came fighting back from a 6-0 deficit for the win. 
Wright State ripped into starter Joy Battersby for six runs in the second inning. Notre Dame fought their way back into the ballgame with a pair of runs in the fourth, fifth, and seventh innings to send the game into extra frames. 
In the ninth, junior right field­er Jenna Knudson reached first on an error, and advanced to third on a sacrifice and a passed ball. 
Katie Marten's one-out single drove her home with the win­ning run. 
The Irish comeback featured 
two home runs by catcher Sara 
Hayes. 
The first was a solo shot, and the second was a two-run tater. First baseman Andy Keys added a pair of RBI singles. 
The Irish were able to get back in the game thanks to Kelly Nichols' seven scoreless innings of relief. Nichols has already tied Staci Alford's sin­gle season save record of five set in 1993. Setting the record is not a question of if, but when. 
"This was truly a game where every player on the team con­tributed to the win," Miller said. 
"It was good to see us hit the way we are capable of hitting. Once we began to focus on base hits instead of power, our of­fense really exploded." 
The pair of sweeps in both 
doubleheaders was important 
for the Irish, who have had 
problems getting the same per­
formance in both games of dou­
bleheaders.

at the hands of IBC 

CHICAGO 

After 234 days, more than $800 million in losses, no World Series and not even a settle­ment, America has its baseball back. 
The longest and costliest work stoppage in the history of professional sports ended Sunday night when owners accepted the union's offer to play without an agreement. 
The season, which had been scheduled to start Sunday night, will begin April 26 and each team will play 144 games, 18 fewer than the usual. 
"I don't regard it as a surren­der," acting commissioner Bud Selig said following a 4 1/2­hour owners meeting. "The players were on strike, they made an unconditional offer to come back, and we accepted that offer." 
However, the owners did not obtain a no-strike promise from the union, leaving open the pos­sibility that players could walk out again late this season if owners again threaten to impose a salary call. Both sides agreed such a promise, at this time, would raise legal compli­cations for players and owners. 
"Anyone who has gone through this eight-month expe­rience will let it serve as a poignant reminder that we have a responsibility to make sure it will never happen again, certainly in our lifetime," Selig said. 
Far more difficult than get­ting players back on the field may be the job baseball faces of restoring the country's faith in the game. 
Though it has faced work stoppages before, this time baseball returns battered and berated by fans who grew weary of what President Clinton described as "just a few hun­dred folks trying to figure out how to divide nearly $2 bil­lion." 
Players may report voluntar­ily starting Wednesday to train­iRg camps in Florida and Ari­zona, although some were ex­porting date is F~iday. 
Until a week ago, there had been speculation owners might lock out players if the union ended the strike without a deal. But the pro-lockout faction, af­ter determining it could not obtain the necessary 21 votes from among the 28 teams, did not even call for a vote. 
"When the clubs heard all the evidence today on what to do and what not to do, the three­quarters became academic," Selig said. 
The strike wiped out the final 52 days and 669 games of the 1994 season and forced the cancellation of the World Series for the first time since 1904. It also wiped out the first 252 games of his season, raising the total of games lost to 921. 
"I think it's clearly a step in the right direction," union head Donald Fehr said. "If they had voted for a lockout, it would have been a clear indication they didn't want peace -at any price." 
The sides still must work to­ward a deal that would replace the collective bargaining agree­ment that expired on Dec. 31, 1993. Players, who walked out last Aug. 12, ended the strike Friday -the 232nd day ­after U.S. District Judge Sonia Sotomayor issued an injunction forcing owners to continue the 
work rules of the expired
agreement. 

"The clubs hope that the 1995 season -including the postseason -will be played without interruption," Selig said. "We hope our fans never again have to go through the heartache we've endured the last eight months." 
Clinton, who failed two months ago in a personal effort to end the strike, said: "Today's decision is good news for the game of baseball, its fans and the local economies of the cities where baseball is played.

• SAINT MARY'S TRACK 
Belles surpass goal at Manchester 
By KEARY SULLIVAN and KELLY MEDLIN 
Sports Writers 
Chilling temperatures and in­tense competition did not hin­der the efforts of the Saint Mary's track team Saturday in the Manchester Invitational. After performing successfully in their indoor meets as well as their meet last Saturday, the Belles were excited to en­counter their toughest competi­tion yet at the invitational. 
After scoring only 10 points at the invitational last year, head coach Larry Szchzechowski set the team scoring goal at 30 points. To Szchechowski's pleasure, the team well surpassed this goal with a score of 36 points. 
"I was very happy with the way we performed," said Szchzechowski. "The team came together well and we did better than we have ever done at this invitational." 
The superiority of the individ­ual competitors greatly con­tributed to the team's overall success. Sophomore shot put­ter Kelly Medlin placed sixth in her event, while sophomore high jumper Paula Kivinen placed fourth. Julie Govorko placed fifth in the javelin with an admirable throw measuring 75"6'. 
"We've all come together as a team and it is exciting to see how we have improved both on the individual and team level," said Govorko. 
The Belles also earned points in the 800, 1500, and 4x400M races. The team was especially proud of their third place finish in the 4x100m relay with a team consisting of junior Jill Jusick, freshman Kristin Donahue, and sophomores Courtney Powers and Theresa Zamarelli. 
Junior Michelle Wenner was one of the driving forces for the team with her fourth place fin­ish in the 1500M, third place finish in the 800M and her par­ticipation in the fourth place finish of the 4x400M relay. 
Erin Mellifont, achieved simi­lar success with a second place finish in the 800m. Freshman Beth Phelan complemented Wenner's efforts with her sixth place finish in the 1500M. 
Overall the team was very satisfied with their perfor­mance, and anticipates their next meet which is a state meet at IUPU next Saturday.

Pete Johnson tried to step up for Butler, scoring two straight goals in the first period to give Butler a 2-1 first quarter lead. Johnson drove in once from both sides. beating keeper Irish Alex Cade. Unfortunately for the Bulldogs, his effort would prove to be futile. 
The lead was short-lived as freshman Jimmy Keenan scored with 13:37 to play in the second period to knot the game at two. 
The Irish took the lead on 'captain Randy Colley's two con­secutive goals to finish the half at 4-2. Colley's first score came from a great dish from behind the cage by junior midfielder Kevin Mahoney. Brian Gilfillan got an assist on Colley's second goal, created off a steal by senior middie Will Sutton. Colley also got the assist on Pasquale's goal, giving him 3 points on the day. 
The Bulldogs kept the game close to start the second half, until strong defensive play led to a goal by Notre Dame's J.T. Tremante. Tremante picked up a loose ball and sent it into an open net to give Notre Dame a 5-2 lead. 
Butler added two goals in the third to come back to a 1 point deficit, but it was too little too late. Attacker Tim Kearney sealed the victory for the Irish, scoring the next two goals to

"I'm not surprised that Butler only scored four. I am sur­prised we only scored seven," Corrigan commented. 
The game tempo was defi­nitely to Notre Dame's advan­tage. The play by the Irish longsticks and defensive mid­dies was too much for the Bulldogs, and Notre Dame's low score total can only be at­tributed to many unforced turnovers and missed scoring opportunities.

Irish keeper Alex Cade main­tained his stellar level of play as the final link in the defensive chain. Cade contributed to the overall effort with 12 saves, while playing the whole game. Cade also helped in the Irish transition game, which cleared their zone in 13 of 16 attempts. 
The Irish took 11 of the 15 face-offs behind junior Greg Glen day. They also corralled 44 ground balls to Butler's 31.

Bats come to life in weekend sweep of Butler 
By MEGAN McGRATH Sports Writer 
According to the Notre Dame baseball coaching staff, the best part about playing 26 of their next 28 games at home is the chance to get in to a daily rou­tine revolving around classes and baseball. 
If this weekend's series with Butler is any indication, that routine will involve winning lots of games at Frank Eck Stadium, as the Irish swept the Bulldogs in consecutive double headers this weekend, 11-5 and 15-5 on Saturday and 3-1 and 17-5 on Sunday. 
"I was impressed with the way we executed this weekend," head coach Paul Mainieri said. "We were successful on our hit and run plays, and were able to put a lot of runs on the board." 
The weekend started out a lit­tle on the shaky side. Notre Dame starting pitcher Christian Parker gave up four runs in the first inning, including a two-run homer by Bulldog designated hitter Andrew Cornell. 
The freshman then settled down, lasting seven and a third innings and surrendering just one run the rest of the way. 
But while Parker was cooling Butler bats, the Notre Dame line-up was getting warmed up. Craig DeSensi and Mike Amrhein laced RBI singles, and an RBI ground ball by Darin Schmalz brought the Irish to within one run in the bottom of the second. Amrhein doubled in the fifth and later scored the tying run on a George Restovich single. 
Mike Balicki came in for Parker in the eighth, with the game tied at five. In the bottom of that frame, the Irish exploded for six runs to put the game out of reach. J.J. Brock belted to two-run double to spark the run-production. 
Balicki was perfect for an in­ning and two-thirds to earn his second win of the year. 
The Irish carried their mo­mentum into the second game. A two-run Amrhein double led to a three-run first. Amrhein was the trigger of a four-run fourth inning, as his bases­loaded double scored Bret Poppleton and DeSensi. 
Poppleton provided some pop of his own, driving in two runs on his first homer of the season in the sixth. Just a batter ear­lier, sophomore Justin Scholl blasted his second long-ball, also a two-run shot. 
"After Christian had a rough first inning (in game one) we didn't give up and got some hits for him," said sophomore out­fielder Scott Sollman, who was 4-9 with two RBI and three runs scored on the day. "We were able to keep hitting in the sec-runs in five innings of work.

Despite loss, meet helps to prepare for future 
By MICHAEL DAY 
Sports Writer 
The eternal optimist lives by the phrase, "It's not whether you win or lose, it's how your play the game." 
Although it's never encourag­ing to lose, the same could be said of the Notre Dame track and field team's 111-92 loss to Western Michigan in an out­door dual meet on Saturday. 
In an early season dual meet, not much stock is put into which team scores the most points or wins the most medals. The focus is more on preparing for tougher meets ahead and using the opportunity to get ri:mch needed competition in the early stages of the outdoor season. 
"It's important to just get your times as low as possible and work from there," said fresh­man Errol Williams. "The goal is to get a qualifying time for the NCAA's as early as possi­ble." 
Williams, who continues to improve with every meet in his first season, helped lead the way for the Irish by placing first in the 110 meter hurdles with a time of 14.60. Fellow freshman Danny Patton's time of 48.4 was good enough for a first place finish in the 400 meters. 
While not dominant, the Irish enjoyed a successful afternoon in the long distance events. Junior John Cowan captured first place in the 3000 meter steeple chase with a time of 9:17.60, while junior Mike Smedley finished a close second with a mark of9:18.11. 
In the 5000 meter distance race, it was sophomore Matt Altohoff who came through for the Irish by winning the event with a time of 14:42.5. Senior Will Clark finished third with a time of 14:50.0. 

Notre Dame owned the 800 
meter run, sweeping first through third against the un­dermanned Broncos. Junior Jeff Hojnacki's mark of 1:51.1 earned him a first place finish followed by junior Joe Curran '(1:55.1) and sophomore Pat 
Gorman (1 :56.0). 

"At this point in the season, 
I'm pretty pleased with the 
progress they've made," said 
assistant coach John Millar. 
"They are well ahead of where 
they were last year at this 
time." 

The Irish weren't quite so suc­
cessful in the field events, and 
that would cost them. Of the 
seven field events on the day, 
only senior Dan Grenough 
walked away with a first place 
finish, winning the pole vault 
with a height of 16' 3". 
Sophomore Mike Fleisch 
placed second in the shot put 
with a throw of 48' 9. 75". 
Teammate Greg Moretti fin­
ished second in the hammer 
throw with a distance of 161' 
8", while senior Brian Headrick 
leaped to a height of 6' 9.5", 
good enough for second place 
in the high jump. 

Although the majority of the 
top women had the weekend 
off, the balance of the squad 
competed in the Indiana 
Intercollegiates at Ball State 
University on Saturday. Senior 
sprinter Monica Cox helped 
lead the Irish to a fifth place re­
sult by placing second in the 
100 meter hurdles with a time factored in Notre Dame's suc­one of four men sent to com­of 14.25. cess, capturing third and fourth pete in the meet, won the Senior Kristi Kramer and place respectively in the 5000 10,000 meter distance race in a sophomore Lindsay Dutton also meter run. Senior Jeff Mackey, time of 31:06.21.

Irish follow Kobata's example 
Junior helps ensure perfect weekend 
By NEIL ZENDER Sporn Writer 
The Notre Dame softball team had a perfect weekend, going 4-0 in doubleheaders against Midwestern Conference opponents Wright State and Butler. 
Unfortunately, junior Terri Kobata wasn't quite as per­fect. The righthander from Villa Park, California only threw one perfect game, and had the audacity to allow one hit in a complete game Saturday shutout. For Kobata (1 0-1). a mediocre outing is actually allowing a hit. Sunday's 8-0 win over Butler in the first game was the eighth perfect game of her career, and her 14th no-hitter. 
Kobata didn't allow a hit out of the outfield, and struck out 17 of 21 batters she faced. That was only good enough to tie the Notre Dame team record. But Kobata isn't fret­ting. She set it against Indiana State last year. 
It would be a disastrous understatement to say that Kobata is in a zone right now. She's so hot, the Irish ground crew will probably be forced to turn on the sprinklers at Ivy Field. Kobata has allowed a paltry two hits in her last three starts, and has whiffed 39 batters. 
Shortstop Meghan Murray scored the winning run in both games against the Butler Bulldogs. The first was on a one-out, second-inning single by senior second baseman Michele Cline. The second was on a passed ball in the second inning of game two, a 13-0 Irish win that was stopped after five innings on the "Mercy Rule". 


Joy Battersby didn't throw a perfect game. But she cer­tainly fired a gem, pitching all five innings and allowing a scant two hits, while improv­ing her record to 8-4.

Butler, 
game 

plan, fail 
By DAVE TREACY 
Sports Writer 

It was not a high scoring af­fair in Moose Krause stadium this Saturday. 
The Butler Bulldogs, normally a fast-paced offensive squad, decided to slow down their play to challenge the Irish at their own game. 
A smart move? Hard to tell. 
The bottom line is that Notre Dame took the bite out of the Bulldogs, sending them away with a 7-4 loss. 
Senior Marc Pasquale, Notre Dame's first scorer on the day. felt that Butler's decision to slow down their game was a good one. "They kept them­selves in the game. If the game stays close, anyone can take it... 
Coach Kevin Corrigan was surprised by Butler's game plan. "I've got to complement Butler. They came out and surprised us. We played a complacent game, and didn't make the right adjustments when we should have." 
However, Corrigan also noted that Butler may have taken the wrong steps to win the game. 
"They tried to slow down to our style of play," he said. "That limited their opportuni­ties. Our defense is too good for them to expect to have suc­cess playing that way." 
Once again, the Irish defense was the basis for the team's success. Captain Mike Iorio
