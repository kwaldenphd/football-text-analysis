Saint Mary's reviews security protocols, does not anticipate changes 
By KATIE KOHLER Saint Mary's Editor 
Saint Mary's students may feel safe on their quiet residential Indiana campus, but until Monday, students iri Blacksburg, Va., felt the same way. In the aftermath of the Virginia Tech shootings, members of the Saint Mary's community have began asking, "Are we safe?" 
College President Carol Ann Mooney addressed those concerns in an e-mail to students Wednesday, asking them to take steps to protect each other. 
"Saint Mary's is a secure place, but that does not mean we have been lulled into complacency," she

Notre Dame has procedures in place to respond to major inci­dents and crises, but the University is not commenting on most specifics of those plans, offi­cials said Wednesday. 
Nationwide, universities have been asked about -and have offered self-evaluations of­emergency protocols in the after­math of Monday's mass slayings at Virginia Tech University. A lone gunman apparently shot and killed two students in a dorm on the Blacksburg, Va., campus two

Jenkins surveys ROTC program at ceremony 
Student cadets, midshipmen receive awards, salute officials at Pass In Review 
By MARCELA BERRIOS Associate News Editor 
University President Father .John Jenkins reviewed all the branches of the ROTC program Wednesday as student cadets and midshipmen marched and saluted him, received awards for outstanding oflicership and earned the presi­dent's praise during the annual Pass In Review ceremony in the Joyce Center. 
A staple of the program's tradi­tion at Notre Dame, the Pass In Review ceremony brought approx­imately 300 members of the Army, Navy and Air Force ROTC together to salute their reviewing oflicer, Jenkins, as well as their com­manding officers and first-rate peers. 
Cadet Dan Henebery, a senior, said Notre Dame's ROTC units usually view the Pass In Review as "a way of saying 'thank you' to the University" for its continued sup­port of the program. 
Jenkins, however, said-he viewed the ceremony as "an opportunity to recognize the hard work and the accomplishments of our ROTC students." 
In the midst of the mutual admi­ration, 10 students accepted awards for their notable perform­ances in the classroom and their roles as officers. Seniors Elaine Kamykowski, Ryan Larson, John

University works for Kinko'sdeal 
By AARON STEINER News Writer 
Students, faculty and staff members who used to turn to the basement of the LaFortune Student Center and the defunct Copy Shop for their photocopying and printing needs will be able to continue that practice if University strikes its desired deal with FedEx Kinko's. 
The Copy Shop, an inde­pendent business, closed March 30, citing high legal costs from an ongoing law­suit with the University over the terms of the lease. While the space isn't completely vacated, the University is now working to bring FedEx Kinko's into LaFortune, said Dan Skendzel, director of administrative services for Business Operations. ' 
The University is in talks with FedEx Kinko's -which currently has a retail location in Grace Hall -and is "working on a plan to imple­ment the new shop," he said. 
Skendzel said a FedEx Kinko's location in LaFortune would provide "all the basic copy services, including some light retail." 
"It will be very similar [to The Copy Shop] in terms of services," he said. 
Ryan Willerton, associate director of facilities for Student Activities, could not say when The Copy Shop's space would be fully vacated, but Skendzel said students shouldn't expect to see FedEx Kinko's in the space until next fall.

INSIDE COLUMN 

Conversion to club enthusiast 
I've never been one to really get involved in groups or teams. Throughout high school and so far in college, I've been involved in 
groups but have  
never fully  lindsay Poulin  
engaged myself.  
I'm usually hop­ 
ing to see what  Photographer  
the group can do  
for me, and not  

the other way around. 
I am a French major and am a due-paying member of the French Club, yet I have never once attend­ed a French Club event. 
I haven't had much motivation to invest myself in the events. 
Perhaps I had only been expect­ing to find something that would benefit me, and in not finding it, became disinterested. 
I've never really thought about this quirk of mine until this year, when I finally found a group that redefined my idea of a group. 
lSI, or Iron Sharpens Iron, feels more like a large extended family to me than a school-sponsored club. 
For those of you not familiar with it, lSI is an entirely student-led, inter-denominational Christian group that meets every Thursday evening in Co-Mo. 
The night includes singing praise and worship followed by a talk given by a student reflecting on images or themes from the Bible. 
Smaller prayer groups come next, and most people head over to Reekers afterwards to hang out. 
It's a very relaxing and rejuve­nating time to get to know other people and to grow in relationship with Christ. 
Since discovering lSI last fall I've been very eager to attend every week. I've made many wonderful friends through the group and have benefited so much from hearing their thoughts, wisdom, and vul­nerabilities of life as a college stu­dent on a path towards Christ. 
In the spirit of family, it is com­forting to be able to share personal struggles as well as hopes and joys with fellow students, and it adds another very rich dimension to col­lege life. 
It is through this group that I have learned that giving is the way for me to be really connected to others and truly engaged. 
So, in the spirit of giving, I invite you to Washington Hall tonight at 8 p.m., to celebrate lSI's 10-year anniversary. . 
It will be a night of thanksgiving for the growth and ministry of lSI and a general reflection on its impact on both students and alum­ni, who have been invited back to campus. 
Hunter Smith, founder of lSI and punter for the Indianapolis Colts, will be in attendance with his band Connersvine to help us celebrate the amazing Works God has done through lSI these past ten years. Anyone and everyone are welcome to join.

SMC student thanks celebs, organizations for going green 
ByJENN METZ 
News Writer 
On the heels of Earth Day, Saint Mary's freshman Jen Fetchko is launching a project that will help raise awareness about the envi­ronmental realities of today's soci­ety. She is starting a letter-writing campaign to thank the organiza­tions and celebrities that have helped bring the problems of global warming into the public spotlight. 
Fetchko. originally from Pennsylvania, said her letters are "universal thank-you's," meant to tell agencies, companies and activists like Whole Foods, Al Gore, Leonardo DiCaprio and the Environmental Defense Fund that someone at Saint Mary's appreci­ates their work. 
Fetehko said she hopes their example leads "other people [to] hopefully see the importance of living in an environmentally con­scious way." 
"These people are working to establish the foundations for future generations," Fetchko said. "I don't expect anything back from them.... I'm just thanking them for what they've done. Young people are especially th~?kful for what they've start­Pd. 
Fetchko said she wanted to pro­tect the environment and work to make her impact on the planet green, choosing a major or a career involving energy consump­tion. 
"I want to make sure it will be a safe place to live . . . this is just a start," she said. "It doesn't matter what political view you have, it's about just doing things, small things even in your home, to make a differ­ence." 
and conserving energy by turning off lights and water. Fetchko recy­cles, uses cold water to do laun­dry and has a garden, among other small things she said can make a big difference.

Fetehko said most people asso­ciate Earth Day with planting trees and buying organic food, but the day is also about "getting the message out and being informed and aware." 
"It can make people think," she said. "People need to keep in mind this message is about the earth and the future. You don't have to actively plant trees." 
She said she hopes people will think about ways in which they can do small things to benefit future generations, like recycling

U.S., Australia plan refugee swap 
CANBERRA. Australia -Australia and the United States have approved a plan involving the movement of a few hundred refugees to each other's jurisdiction, the Australian gov­ernment said Wednesday. 
Australia said it was a bid by both nations to deter asylum seekers, but critics charged it would likely to spur an even bigger wave of migrants. 
In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack called the deal an "informal agreement" that "does not create legal obligations." 
'The arrangement does not call for an exchange or a swap of individuals," he said. "And no person ... who is referred would be forced to accept resettlement." 
Drug gang violence grows in Brazil 
RIO DE JANIERO, Brazil -Gangsters with automatic weapons shoot it out with police in broad daylight near downtown. Parents use their bodies to shield children on their way to school. Passengers on buses stuck in traffic hit the floor as bullets shatter windows. 
A day after terrorizing gunbattles left at least 19 criminals lying dead in the streets, Brazilians grappled Wednesday with a shocking image of how far Rio de Janeiro has sunk into violence as Brazil prepares for a papal visit next month and the Pan American games this summer. 
"You can't protect yourself," said Jorge llenrique dos Santos, who was grazed in the head by a stray bullet that tore into a bus. "How can you protect yourself if you get shot just sit­ting on a bus?" 
The worst bloodshed was in the Mineira shan­tytown, where 13 people died. Officials said two were killed by police and the rest died in fight­ing between rival drug gangs.

Bush warns Sudan to end bloodshed 
WASHINGTON -President Bush, ramping up pressure on Sudan, said Wednesday the United States will tighten economic sanctions and impose new ones if Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir does not take quick, concrete steps to stop the bloodshed in Darfur. 
Bush said the Sudanese government must allow U.N. support forces, facilitate deployment of a full U.N.-African Union peacekeeping force, stop supporting violent militias and let humani­tarian aid reach the people of Darfur. 
"The world needs to act," Bush said. 'If President al-Bashir does not meet his obliga­tions, the United States of America will act." 
Bush said the United States would tighten eco­nomic sanctions on Sudan, barring certain com­panies from taking part in the U.S. financial sys­tem; target sanctions on individuals responsible for violence; and apply new sanctions against the government of Sudan.

ROCHESTER, Ind. -A jail inmate was charged Wednesday with attempted murder and conspiracy in an alleged plot to kill seven people, including the county prosecutor, a city police officer and a Superior Courtjudge. 
Ronald P. Lambert Jr., 42, of Rochester, who was in the Fulton County Jail awaiting sentencing on an unrelated charge, allegedly offered another inmate four pounds of marijuana to help him find someone to kill Prosecutor Rick Brown, officer Andrew Shotts, Judge Wayne Steele and four others.

Va tech gunman sent materials to NBC 


Killer mailed photos and videos to media company midway through massacre 
Associated Press 
BLACKSBURG, Va. ­Midway through his murder­ous rampage, the Virginia Tech gunman went to the post office and mailed NBC a package containing photos and videos of him brandish­ing guns and delivering a snarling, profanity-laced tirade about rich "brats" and their "hedonistic needs." 
"You had a hundred billion chances and ways to have avoided today," 23-year-old Cho Seung-Hui says in a harsh monotone, in an excerpt shown on "NBC Nightly News." "But you decided to spill my blood. You forced me into a corner and gave me only one option. The decision was yours. Now you have blood on your hands that will never wash off." 
NBC said the package con­tained a rambling and often­incoherent, 1,800-word video manifesto, plus 43 photos, 11 of them showing him aiming handguns at the camera. 
He repeatedly suggests he was picked on or otherwise hurt. 

"You have vandalized my heart, raped my soul and torched my conscience," he says. "You thought it was one pathetic boy's life you were extinguishing.

ROTC 
continued from page 1 
Harrington, Erin Smith, Casie Sweeney, Karl Kadon, C. Scott Martin and John-Paul Adrian were among the cadets and midshipmen that received decorations Wednesday. 
Henebery received two top hon­ors, including the Patrick Haley Award for mastery of the Army Training Management system. 
"Essentially, this is the formal system used by the army in the training of its troops," Henebery said. "Army cadets, as future offi­cers, must all be well versed in this system." 
He will be commissioned as a lieutenant of Infantry in the spring. 
Henebery's fellow cadet, senior Ashley Shelton, received the Noel Dube award "for participation and leadership in the Arnold Air Society, which is the service organi­zation affiliated with Air Force ROTC," she said. 
While flattered, Shelton was quick to share the recognition with her peers and teammates. 
"Our branch of Arnold Air is full of men and women who are highly dedicated to serving the greater community with their time and tal­ents, and the real honor is to have been able to serve with them these past four years," Shelton said. 
Following the presentation of the top ROTC students, Jenkins took the stage to tell the cadets and mid­shipmen about the marriage their characters as servicemen have with their roles as Notre Dame stu­dents. 
He said the principles of their military training -service, disci­pline and selflessness -reflect the principles the University espouses, and he urged them to keep them in their hearts when they serve in the armed forces. 
Jenkins said Notre Dame has sought to teach and train the lead­ers of the country's military to make sure they will judge wisely and act justly when they face diffi­cult decisions that may determine the fate of incalculable civilians. 
The University, he said, will con­tinue to welcome ROTC students on its campus and praise their deter­mination to serve the country. 
In March, a group of Catholic Workers from different cities in the Midwest staged an unauthorized demonstration on campus, ques­tioning Notre Dame's decision to sponsor military programs despite the University's Catholic -and consequently nonviolent -charac­ter. 
When asked about the Catholic Workers' opposition to the ROTC program, Jenkins cited the rewards of educating future military leaders in Notre Dame's Catholic tradition to guarantee sensible officers at the helm of the armed forces. 
"As Catholics, we recognize and respect anybody who may take a position of conscientious pacifism," Jenkins said. "But at the same time we recognize the importance of educating those who will serve con­scientiously in the military servic­es." 
The Pass In Review ceremony has its roots in medieval Europe, when soldiers would march in front of their lords to let them inspect the units and assess their readiness for battle, Henebery said. 
He said he was thrilled about the Review because it gives the ROTC branches an opportunity to display precision drilling to their class­mates. 
'The rest of the year, other stu­dents see us going to and from class in uniform, but otherwise what we do is a mystery to them. The Pass in Review is the only time where we do something for the public to see."

IN BRIEF 
H.H. Gregg to offer stocks to public 
INDIANAPOLIS -H.H. Gregg Appliances, a video product and appliance retailer with stores in several states, has filed plans to raise up to $172.5 million through an initial public offering of common stock. 
The Indianapolis-based company said in a fil­ing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that Credit Suisse and Lehman Brothers are the lead underwriters for the offer­ing. The retailer intends to list its stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "HGG." 
lUI. Gregg currently operates 77 stores in Ohio, Indiana, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina and Alabama. 
The company reported a $13 million profit for the nine-month period that ended Dec. 31, down from $18.5 million for the same period a year earlier. However, sales rose from $679 mil­lion to $776 million during those same time frames. 
The company attributed the increase to the addition of seven stores and a 3 percent increase in same-store sales. 

Motorola posts first loss in years 
CHICAGO -Motorola Inc. posted its first quarterly loss since 2004 on Wednesday as dis­mal sales continued to vex the struggling cell phone maker. 
Worse still, the company said its misfortunes would continue through the second quarter. 
Blaming disappointing sales of mobile phones, as well as expenses to cover a legal settlement, restructuring efforts and an acquisition, the telecommunications equipment maker said it lost $181 million, or 8 cents per share, in the first three months of 2007. That compares with a profit of $686 million, or 27 cents per share, during the same period a year earlier. 
Those results met Wall Street's drastically lowered expectations, which followed a warning last month that sales at the world's No. 2 cell phone maker would fall more than $1 billion short of previous projections. 
Overall, first-quarter sales slid 1.8 percent, to $9.43 billion, from $9.61 billion a year ago. Still, that eame in ahead of the $9.29 billion expected by Wall Street analysts polled by Thomson Financial. 

Nissan to release new diesel Maxima 
Vehicle available in U.S. in 2010, will comply with national emissions standard 
Associated Press 

WASIIINGTON -Nissan Motor Co. Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn said Wednesday the Japanese automaker would intro­duce a diesel version of the Nissan Maxima in the United States in 2010. 
Ghosn, in a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations, said the vehicle would comply with emis­sions standards in all 50 states and provide improved fuel economy and lower carbon dioxide emissions. 
"The launch of the Maxima will mark the start of a broader diesel strategy in the United States," Ghosn said, adding the company was studying diesel vehicles in other markets. 
Automakers have been turning to diesels amid projections of increased interest in the vehicles, which are popular in Europe. J.D. Power and Associates has estimated that diesels will grow from 3.6 percent of the 
U.S. market to about 9 percent by 2013. 
Ghosn, who also serves as chief executive of Nissan's French partner, Renault SA, said the automaker was develop­ing alternative vehicles to sulfur diesel fuel.

hours before op.ening fire and killing 30 more people in one of the school's academic buildings half a mile away. 
"Suffice it to say, that plans do exist," University spokesman Don Wycliff said. "They are constantly being reviewed in light of the Virginia Tech experience, and we would be [foolish] if we do not attempt to review those plans." 
Wycliff said he expects Notre Dame to comment on campus security plans in the future, but he couldn't give an exact date. 
Notre Dame Security/Police (NDSP) Director Phil Johnson declined to comment on NDSP's procedures for crisis manage­ment plans and referred all questions to University repre­sentatives in the Office of News and Information. 

Wycliff declined to comment on what offices have the authority to lock down build­ings or entire portions of cam­pus in the event of an emer­gency. He would not say if the University has a campus broad­casting system it could use to transmit emergency messages to faculty, students and staff. 
But Gordon Wishon, the University's chief information officer, said Notre Dame has been looking into the possibility of compiling a database of cel­lular phone numbers to send text messages to in the event of a campus emergency. 
Wishon said the University is preparing to launch a pilot pro­gram of the text messaging sys­tem, and it will test the service throughout the remainder of this semester and summer. lie said the University expects to have this service fully ready by the fall. 
He said the discussions and plans received more attention and support when Notre Dame eliminated standard telephone lines in each dorm room in 2006. 
"We began exploring that some time ago ... realizing that the primary mode of communi­cation for college students is cell phones," Wishon said of the text messaging plan. 
Wishon noted that the University added voicemail service and each student is given a voieemail number," but officials believed they needed to look into other methods of eommunieation in case of a cri­sis. 
"We knew that wouldn't work in case of an emergency," Wishon said. 
In addition to the text mes­saging plan, Wishon said the Office of Information Technology has looked into and is investigating the possibility of voice messages and video messages -available through e-mails or from a Web site ­as well as the idea of utilizing the closed-cireuit television system on eampus for public service announcements. 
Wishon said the University is looking into the possibility of broadcasting an emergency tone on Notre Dame's 10 reserved cable channels to alert the University community of any emergencies if it deemed it necessary. 
"The bottom line is that we are looking for as many ways as we can to communicate with students, as well as staff and faeulty, in an emergency or eri­sis situation," he said. "As ter­rible as Monday's tragedy is, the administration here at the University has been working to refine its crisis management plan for some time." 
Wishon said the work to "refine" and review crisis man­agement plans was organized and initiated by the Office of the President.

Protocol 
continued from page 1 
said in the e-mail. "We must remember that college safety and seeurity is everyone's responsibility." 
In an e-mail Tuesday, Vice President of Student Affairs Karen Johnson told students to keep their eyes open and report any suspieious activity on earn­pus -espeeially near the resi­dence halls. 
"Don't let people 'tailgate' into the residence halls behind you," Johnson said. "If anyone tries to do so, report them to the desk attendant or College Seeurity." 
Current emergency protocol 
While the events at Virginia Tech are making colleges across the nation question their eurrent safety proeedures, Saint Mary's is simply working to improve the security protoeols in place. 
Saint Mary's is trying to improve the existing standard operating procedure in the event of a gun erime or shoot­ing on eampus, said Saint Mary's Director of Security David Gariepy. 
But rather than a reaction to Monday's Virginia Tech blood­bath, Johnson said these upgrades are always on the administration's agenda. 
"This is not something we just started working on," she said. "Seeurity is always of utmost importance, and so we are always working on making it better." 
The administration and mem­bers of a security planning com­mittee, she said, are currently reviewing a new duty manual. 
The Saint Mary's Security Web site has a detailed emer­gency response plan for ehemi­cal or biological threats and natural disasters, keeping the stipulations of Homeland Seeurity. There is no specific mention, however, of gun erime protoeols. 
In any emergeney, students can expect notification via e­mail, telephone and direct con­taet, according to the Web site. 
The site also encourages stu­dents to have emergency sup­plies pre-packed in case of an evaeuation and take shelter in the basement of Regina Hall. 
"It is not recommended you remain in your room or ollice, nor should you leave the cam­pus. Assistance will be provided for you there," the Web site reads. 
As helpful these tips may be, Gariepy said eaeh situation is different and unpredietable. 
"Everything pertains to a par­ticular situation. Going by the book doesn't always eut it," he said. "Students should always be aware." 

The problem, though, is that most students are not keeping an eye out for suspicious activi­ties, and even if they did, they might simply panie, sophomore Kristen Anderson said. 
"If there was a shooting, a bomb threat, a rapist on cam­pus, anything really. I would have no idea how to react, and I know many students feel the same way," she said. 
Sophomore Perri Hamma felt the same, saying she was still shaking from hearing about the Virginia Tech massacre and wouldn't know how to react in a similar situation. 
"I honestly don't have any idea about our emergency pro­cedures," Hamma said. "If something bad happened, I don't think I'd know what to do." 
Accessing residence halls 
Of the four residence halls on Saint Mary's campus, only one -McCandless Hall -has an ID card swipe access system in place at the front door. LeMans and ing people where they are is good. In others, it could be dan­gerous." 
While heightened seeurity is assumed during emergency sit­uations, the security Web site said that in case of an evacua­tion of Regina, all swipe-card systems would be deactivated "for easy aecess." 
Johnson also said a campus lockdown is not necessarily the first choice. 
"It really depends on if we can safely evaluate if it is safer to stay in your rooms or go some place safer," she said. "At Virginia Tech, it was decided it was safer to stay in the dorms. It really depends." 
Communication and coopera­tion 
In the case of Monday's mas­sacre, authorities are still inves­tigating Virginia Teeh's response rate and implementa­tion of its protoeols. While Saint Mary's is willing to employ every method of communieation to alert students, Gariepy said notifying students too early

"I don't think there is any greater risk at Holy Cross than other dorms that require swip­ing," Johnson said. "If some­body really wants to get into any..building, they will figure it out. 
Johnson gave residents -not ID card capabilities -the responsibility of keeping the halls clear of strangers. 
"The dorm is only as safe as the people that live there make it," she said. 

Lockdown 
In the event of a lockdown, Saint Mary's will "start at the top," Gariepy said. The presi­dent will make the judgment call through recommendations from security oflicials. 
A lockdown, however, may not be the safest option. 
"Loekdown isn't always a good option. It is determined by the particular event we are dealing with and may cause more harm than good," Gariepy said. "In some situations, keep­don't have to." 
Once the situ­ation has been identified, how­ever, Gariepy said the College would alert students in person, through e-mails, flyers and even an emergency toll-free number with regularly updated messages about the status of the emergency. This number is aimed more at parents, he said. 
From there, the College noti­fies other ageneies, ineluding the St. Joseph County Police Department and Notre Dame Security/Police, to assist with the handling of the situation, Gariepy said. He said he is con­fident that these eollaborations, combined with a calm and col­lected approach, will yield the best possible results for stu­dents. · 
"We [campus security) will stick to protocol at the present time," Gariepy said. "We always talk to the staff after events like this to keep it fresh in our minds, but, for the most part, we are going to stay consistent with our policies."

Parochial education leaders, such as Ketchum, and parents who benefit from School Choice programs were in attendance. 
According to the Alliance for Student Choice, the program empowers "parents to select the educational environment they feel is best for their child." 
Parents are given the oppor­tunity to exercise choice through the use of various school selection tools, such as tax credit and school vouchers, in schools outside their own communities, according to the organization's Web site. 
"A parental choice is a very important part of educational excellence. And one way to make sure that that's the case is not only to fully fund the 
D.C. Opportunity Scholarship, but to provide these kinds of scholarships for school systems outside of Washington," Bush said. 
The program is especially

We will always be great friends of and advocates for school choice."

Spring stor111s hit East coast, kill18 
Associated Press 
PORTLAND -Utility crews cut their way through toppled trees Wednesday to restore service to thousands of cus­tomers still without power since a huge weekend storm battered the East Coast. 
Communities from New Jersey to Maine were still cop­ing with stream flooding after the storm dumped more than 8 inches of rain in places, along with coastal flooding brought on by astronomical high tides and heavy surf. 
Eighteen deaths were blamed on the weather system, including a woman whose body was pulled from a New Jersey river on Wednesday. 
New Hampshire safety offi­cials made plans Wednesday to breach the 19th-century Hayden Mill Pond dam at Hollis to relieve the pressure of high water from the storm and avert a failure. A dozen fami­lies living near the six-acre reservoir were evacuated Tuesday evening and National Guard troops closed part of a highway as a precaution. 
More than 50,000 businesses and homes remained without power in Maine, where Central Maine Power Co. was being helped by repair crews from neighboring New Brunswick and Nova Scotia and as far away as Pennsylvania. 
Utility officials warned that some people might be without power until the end of the week. 
"It's a huge number of trees that are down, so it's a big job cutting those away," said CMP spokesman John Carroll. "Plus there are 250 broken poles. That's an enormous number of poles." 
Utilities in New Hampshire reported nearly 17,000 homes and businesses still had no electricity, down from roughly 90,000 at the peak, and said some might not be reconnect­ed until the weekend. 
In many areas, road damage and fallen trees blocked repair crews' access, said New Hampshire Electric Cooperative spokesman Seth Wheeler. 
"There are 18 different tree crews we've hired ... just clearing trees first before the line crews can get in there and do construction," Wheeler said. 
About 1,400 New Jersey res­idents were in emergency shel­ters because of flooding, up slightly from Tuesday, as more rivers crested. Rescue crews went house to house by boat in a flooded section of Fairfield asking if residents of about three dozen homes needed to be evacuated, said State Police Sgt. Stephen Jones. 
"The numbers are fluctuat­ing, actually going down in some places as folks go home, but rising in others as people who had been holding out just give in and go to a shelter," Jones said. 
Sections of some New Jersey highways were still closed by standing water. 
About 40 New Hampshire roads remained closed by high water or damage, Gov. John Lynch said. Most were expect­ed to be reopened soon, but it could take weeks to repair landslide damage to Route 101 in Wilton, Department of Transportation spokesman Bill Boynton said. 
Lynch had asked the Federal Emergency Management Agency to start a preliminary damage assessment in all 10 counties to determine eligibili­ty for federal disaster relief. 
"Many New Hampshire com­munities have been over­whelmed by all the flooding," he said, noting that about 6,000 residents still could not return home. 
Swollen rivers in Massachusetts were receding but waves still crashed over sea walls and flooded coastal roads early, authorities said. 
Two families were evacuated from oceanfront homes in Duxbury, Mass., late Tuesday but were able to return the next morning, fire Capt. Skip Chandler said. Their homes had knee-deep water on the ground floor, he said. "Thank goodness it wasn't worse," he said. 
Most roads had reopened in the suburbs north of New York City, as homeowners in Westchester County piled water-ruined carpets and fur­niture in heaps outside. 
On Fire Island, a barrier island along the south side of New York's Long Island, some homes were clinging to narrow beaches atop rickety pilings because the storm's waves had scoured the sand out from beneath them.

Gates: Iran diplomacy needs time 
Associated Press 
TEL AVIV-Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Wednesday that diplomatic efforts to resolve the standoff with Iran over its nuclear program are working and should get a chance to suc­ceed. 
Both the U.S. and Israel accuse Iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons,. which Tehran denies. Gates said many nations are "united in telling Iran what it needs to do with respect to its nuclear program." 
The United States and its allies have led efforts to pass two U.N. Security Council resolutions pun­ishing Iran for refusing to sus­pend uranium enrichment. That process can be used to develop nuclear weapons. 
"We agreed it was important to deal with the Iranian nuclear problem through diplomacy, which appears to be working," Gates said at a news conference with Defense Minister Amir Peretz. 
"These things don't work overnight, but it seems to me clearly the preferable course to keep our focus on the diplomatic initiatives, and particularly because of.the united front of the international community at this point," Gates said. 
His words appeared aimed at diffusing suggestions in Israel and 

the U.S. that the Pentagon is mov­ing toward a strike against Iran. 
At the same time, Gates con­firmed the U.S. commitment to Israel, noting that he is the first Pentagon chief to visit country in eight years. 
"I think the fact that I have come here in the end of my fourth month as secretary illustrates the importance that I attach to our relationship with Israel," he said. 
Discussing Iraq, Gates decried the attacks Wednesday in Baghdad that killed more than 170 people. The violence, he said, was "horrifying" and he blamed al-Qaida. 
He said the attackers were try­ing to show that the U.S. security plan for Baghdad was failing. "These terrorists are killing inno­cent men, women and children who are Iraqis. They're killing their countrymen," Gates said. 
Earlier, in Cairo, Egypt, Gates hewed to the Bush administra­tion's line that any U.S. military failure in Iraq would unleash sec­tarian strife and extremism that would be felt first in the Middle East. 
Speaking to an American Chamber of Commerce luncheon on the third day of his Middle East travels, Gates exhorted Arab countries to use their influence to undermine the insurgency and encourage political reconciliation in Iraq. 
"Whatever disagreements we might have had over how we got to this point in Iraq, the conse­quences of a failed state in Iraq -of chaos there -will adversely impact the security and prosperi­ty of every nation in the Middle East and the Gulf region," Gates said. 
Gates, on his third trip to the region as defense secretary, reaf­firmed the U.S. commitment to Iraq and to protecting allies in the area. In Washington, the Democratic-controlled Congress and the administration are near­ing a showdown about bringing an end to the war. 
U.S. military officials, mean­while, have stepped up their criti­cism of Iran, saying this week for the first time that Iranians are involved in providing weapons to Afghanistan. 
Marine Gen. Peter Pace, chair­man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Tuesday that U.S. forces recently intercepted Iranian­made weapons intended for Taliban fighters in Afghanistan. Military officials have said for months that Iranians are supply­ing weapons and training to insurgents in Iraq. 
Asked about the latest develop­ment Wednesday, Gates said the 
U.S. does not know the magni­tude of the problem or to what level in the Iranian government it rises.

Masked gunmen storm hospital, kill 3 
Associated Press 
TIJUANA -Police and sol­diers battled gunmen at a hos­pital in the border city of Tijuana Wednesday in violence that left at least three people dead before the authorities subdued the attackers, officials said. 
Shooting first erupted when about seven masked gunmen enterod the public hospital and were confronted by a group of state police who happened to be escorting prisoners for rou­tine treatment, said Tijuana Police Commander Jaime Niebla. 
Two state police officers and one of the gunmen were killed in the clash, Niebla said. 
Red Cross representative Fernando Esquer said he believed the gunmen were try­ing to free one of the prisoners receiving treatment. 
The gunmen holed up in a ward for several hours until dozens of soldiers and federal police stormed in. More shots were heard ricocheting from the building, and it was unclear if there were any more deaths. 
Soldiers were seen taking several detainees with their 
faces covered from the facility. 
Authorities evacuated 500 personnel and patients from the hospital's seven floors, tak­ing some to nearby private hos­pitals. There were no immedi­ate reports of patients suffering injuries. 
Officials initially feared that patients had been taken hostage, but Niebla later said there were no hostages. 
Mexican gangs have stormed several hospitals across the country in recent years to kill injured rivals or free prisoners. 
In January, President Felipe Calderon sent 3,300 soldiers and federal police to Tijuana to hunt down drug gangs. 
Dubbed "Operation Tijuana," the initiative was part of a nationwide military offensive, in which Calderon has sent more than 24,000 troops to states plagued by execution­style killings and beheadings as rival gangs fight over marijua­na plantations and smuggling routes. 
Drug gangs were blamed for more than 2,000 murders nationwide in 2006 and have left a particularly bloody trail in Tijuana, where more than 300 people were slain last year.

Edwards uses campaign funds to pay for haircuts 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Looking pret­ty is costing John Edwards' presi­dential campaign a lot of pennies. 
The Democrat's campaign com­mittee picked up the tab for two haircuts at $400 each by celebrity stylist Joseph Torrenueva of Beverly Hills, Calif., according to a financial report filed with the Federal Election Commission. 
FEC records show Edwards also availed himself of $250 in services from a trendy salon and spa in Dubuque, Iowa, and $225 in services from the Pink Sapphire in Manchester, N.H., 
which is described on its Web site as "a unique boutique for the mind, body and face" that caters mostly to women. 
A spokeswoman for Edwards' campaign did not respond to requests for comment. 
Torrenueva -who specializes in men's haircuts-confirmed in an interview with The Associated Press that Edwards is a longtime client and friend. 
"I do cut his hair and I have cut it for quite a while," Torrenueva said. "We've been friends a long
. ,
time. Referring to a picture of Edwards published Tuesday in 
The Los Angeles Times, Torrenueva said: "That's my cut." The stylist said he couldn't vouch for the source of Edwards' hair­cuts in other photos. 
One reason the cost of the cut was so steep even by Beverly Hills standards is that Torrenueva went to Edwards rather than the candidate coming into the stylist's salon a block off Rodeo Drive. 
"I go to him wherever conven­ient," Torrenueva said. He declined to identify where the cuts paid for by the campaign took place. 
Campaign records also show the former North Carolina sena­tor's campaign paid $248 on March 1 to the Designworks Salon in Dubuque. 
According to Designworks' Web site, the salon and spa features a wide variety of beauty and health services, including massages, facials, body polishes, self tan­ners, and rosemary mint and Caribbean therapy body wraps. 
The salon's owners did not return a call. 
Pink Sapphire co-owner Ariana Franggos said the two payments hist month -$150 on March 7 and $75 on March 20-were for doing Edwards' makeup for tele­vision appearances. She handles

Woman sentenced to life injail 
Used chainsaw to hack up acquaintance 
Associated Press SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -A jury on Wednesday spared the life of a woman who killed an acquaintance and hacked up her body with a chainsaw, sen­tencing her to life in prison without parole. Daphne Wright, 43, smiled after the verdict was read. Wright was convicted last week of kidnapping and murdering Darlene VanderGiesen, 42, in February 2006. VanderGiesen's mother, Dee, told Wright that God had helped the family forgive her. "We pray for you every day asking that God may touch your heart, that you may come to know his love and that you repent of your sins and seek God's forgiveness," she said. Dee VanderGiesen told Wright's mother, Carolyn Tucker: "We both have lost our daughters. One to death and the other to prison time for as long as she lives. May God's grace be shown to you at this time of pain in your life." Prosecutors said that Wright was jealous of the friendship VanderGiesen had with Wright's former lover and that it turned to rage that drove Wright to kid­nap VanderGiesen, kill her, burn the body and cut it apart with a chain saw. VanderGiesen's remains were found in a Sioux Falls landfill and a Minnesota ditch. In closing arguments earlier in the day, prosecutor Dave Nelson said Wright, who like VanderGiesen is deaf, deserved to die by lethal injection because the mutilation was the act of a depraved mind. But he said he respected the jury's verdict. "I think they reached this decision independently of any of the diversions of race, of deaf­ness or anything else. I think they decided this case on the evidence," he said. Wright's public defender, Jeff Larson, argued that she burned and cut the body as an after­thought and that the slaying was an isolated act motivated by jealousy. Nelson told jurors their ver­dict would be just if they treated both women equally. VanderGiesen was white and heterosexual; Wright is a black lesbian.

Anyone old enough to speak coherently at the time still remembnrs the moment, · over forty years ago, when thny heard about JFK's assassination. Our grandpar­ents can tell us how they listenml to the radio acmunL'i of Pearl I !arbor on a December day, more than six decades gone. Every single one of us hern at Notre Dame can recall where we were on the day of' SPpt. 11, 2001 -what we were doing, how the horribly tragie evenL'i of that morning unfolded for us and our personal feelings on the matter. Any time somnonn shares a personal story of That Day, I'm always amazed at the details people rncall. 
I remember listening to Paulllarvey's show on my AM radio whiln driving to school when he announced the first plane crash. I remember talking about it with my friend belbrn the start of first-hour Biology, and I remember the girl who came in and told us the other tower had bmm hit. I remember conversations I had that day, thlngs different teachers said and talking with my grandparents in the evening. That was my experience, hall' a country away, without a personal connection to anyone involved. The mass media of the past cen­tury gave rise to a new, sharod cultural experience, a common reference point that breaches distance and background: the generation-defining event. 
When we hear 9/11 described this way, it is absolutely on-target. 
This week, we have another national tragedy. News of the massacre at Virginia Tech on Monday spread like wildfire throughout both national and international outlets, even reaching most of us studying

abroad in Europn within the hour. We learned of the catastrophe over tolovision stations, through quickly formnd Faenbook groups, on lntnrn11t news sites and during instant messaging eonversations. Solid f'aeL'i eame slowly. but no rnport eould s<mi­tizn away tlw fi1ar, confusion, anger, tor­rnntial grief' and host of other emotions that assault us all in such times. 
This is tlw grnat cursn of' our gnnnra­tion's hyper-awarn1wss and thn awesomn power of modern media. We cannot escape tlw s1mtimnnL'i swirling around tlw tragndies, and tlwy cannot rnmain anony­mous or distant to us. It is hard to ignore tlw images of' grown men and women cry­ing as dead eollege students arn carried away, the surrnal sounds of gunshoL'i being fired on a peacof'ul eollnge campus or the first-hand aceounl'i of' courage and action during the Viq.,>inia shootings. I hositate to eompan1 this with <J/11; tlw numbnrs, eir­cumstanees, impact, source, scope and moans are worlds apart. Yet both ineidnnts servo to painfully rnmind us that those 1wenl'i always seem to be assoeiatnd with sorrow, tragedy and death. 
The evenLc; of Monday, though still fresh in my mind, will probably not stick with me as do those of IJ/11. Sadly, the thousands of students and faculty and staff eonnncted with the university, the thousands of par­enL'i worrying at home and the thousands of rnsidents in the surrounding community don't have that luxury of separation. For them, this will become a "where were you when ... " event. Monday will haunt their minds and stay with them for the duration of their lives. Iloaling can take place, and God willing, can come soon, but memories of all the little details from Monday will stick. Meanwhile, the rest of us are stuck asking ourselves: I low many more of these "defming" events ean we plan on seeing in the coming years and decades? And when can we expect one judged not by the body count or human toll, but by the rewards and human joy brought about? 
Some may say any event that becomes eunstantly discussed, like 9/11, does not develop iL'i crystalline clarity in the momenL'i of its occurrnnce. but rather slowly cemenLc; itself during thn constant re~-,rurgitation of faeL'i and satellite details in the months and years li>llowing. Even if this wnrn the case, we arn still left empty­handPd trying to think of a ubiquitous posi­tive evnnt. I firmly beliew that such evenL'i, incredibly wonderful instPad of shockingly horrific. are entirely possible. Unfortun­ately, we are still waiting to seP what sueh an event would look like. 
The consistently negative nature of these events can be explained to some degree. "Good evnnL'i," lor one, rarely culminate in one triumphant moment. Tragedy, on thn other hand. catches us unaware. In the shock, the horrific faeL'i eome slowly and there are a thousand unknowns. With tri­umphant accomplishmenLc;, tho event is often merely symbolic and known well in advance. The closest models I can call to mind arn the fall of the Berlin Wall­which I and most of my cla'ismates were too young to remember -and the moon landing, decades before we were born.

We have yet to gather around our televisions and comput­ers to share joy instead of sorrow, fulfill­ment instead of shock, pleasure instead of anger. We are the waiting. But for the moment, in respect for the VIrginia Tech community, let us remember tl1at we are also among the mourning.

lETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Some law students not so discontented 
Law school faculty praiseworthy 
As recent alumnae of the law school, we feel that we must respond to the April 17 article, "Law Students Show Discontent." We certainly share our former classmates' concern with NDLS' recent drop in the ran kings, the adnquacy of the current building, the planned new building, recent faculty depar­tures and the administration in general. However, we cannot agree with our classmates' assessment of faculty quality. In our three years as JD students, we had the good fortune of being taught by the most talented, dedicated and intelligent professors we could ever hope for. They may have been hard on us in our first-year classes, but over three years the overwhelming majority of our professors went above and beyond their classroom duties. 
We can recall many, many times when a professor assisted us with our personal research interests, advised us on career opportunities, stayed late at night to assist us with clinical work, gave us a home phone number to call in case we needed help with anything and even hosted us for a meal at his home. We have had professors who shared our political viewpoints, disagreed with us vehemently or who never gave us the slightest hint as to their political leanings, and we can say with certainty that none of our professors ever allowed his political views to influence his treatment of students. 
Our education was enhanced by the Catholic atmosphere of the law school as issues of faith, ethics and morality permeated discussions on any subject. Like our classmates, we were often annoyed by our required courses. As public interest lawyers, we were more burdened by required corporate and tax law classes than by classes on ethics and philosophy. But even those tedious subjects are taught by dedicated, enthusiastic faculty who did their best to make their subjects interesting and uncomplicated for their less-than-enthusiastic students. Criticizing a professor because one did not like his class or teaehing style is unfair, and we ean vouch for the quality of the professors who taught our jurispru­dence and ethics dasses as well as the quality of the material taught. 
We also share our classmates' concerns about the number of course offerings. There are more class­es offered on corporate law than any other subject, and we often struggled to fill up our schedules with eourses geared toward public interest work. We hope that the administration will make a real effort to retain the stellar current faculty, including library and clinical faculty, and hire new faculty in all areas of law. Law school was far from the best three years of our lives. We, like the current JD students, were constantly frustrated with an unresponsive and sometimes malicious administration, substandard facil­ities and ijmited cour~e offerings. But we credit NDLS' excellent faculty with making tl1ose three years as enjoyable as law school could possibly be and with forming us into the ethical, hardworking and open-minded lawyers we are today. We eonsider ourselves not only better lawyers but better people for having known and learned from them; and whatever our concerns about the leadership of the law school, we will always lend them the highest praise. They earn it every day.

Remember the 
'intangibles' 
I'd just like to take a minute to respond to Tuesday's Observer article on the discontent in the law school due to the recent drop in the rankings ("Law students show discontent," April 17). As a 1L, I ean't comment specifically on many of the concerns voiced in the article or on various alleged short-comings of the law school. I also won't pretend that while applying to law schools last year I wasn't obsessed with rankings or wasn't able to, in a way that bordered on disturbing, spout off from memory the top 40 schools in order. Rankings do matter and as students who take pride in our sehool and in how hard we've worked to get here, it is only right that we should be concerned. But I think it's also important to take a deep breath and take a look around. 
Notre Dame, unlike many other places, is more than a number in U.S. News and World Report. As a "double-domer," I had many friends, both as an undergrad and now as a law·student, who had the grades and the test scores to have their pick of any school in the country. In my five years here, however, I've met more people who chose to go to ND over more highly-ranked institutions than people who came to ND because it was "the best place they got in." While Notre Dame will always continue to be an elite academic institution, it is the intangibles which set us apart-our Catholic character, our student spirit, our dedi-. cation to social justice and (who could forget) our football team -just to name a few. I don't think I need to write a laundry list of everything that makes Notre Dame great. I think most of us already know what they are. We should also acknowledge that most of these things ean't be expressed in a number. So while, yes, rankings matter, and we should always strive to be the best that we can be in ANY area, I believe that Notre Dame will find its way back to the top. In the meantime, there's nowhere else I'd rather be. 
Laura Geldermann law student O'Hara Grace April IS 

Graphic art exhibit does exactly -what it set out to 
You'll have to forgive my friend Jay. Obviously, he is a philosophy grad student and prone to a sort of theoretical debauchery. But I find it disingenuous and theatrical to trot out linguistic sins like "stale objectivity of Kantian aesthetics" and "aboutness" when measuring the work of so many soon-to-be graduates. The heart of his argu­ment-a breathless caricature of modernism's belief in the virgin purity of eapital-A Art-doesn't square with the BFA/MFA exhibit. 
First of all, few of the studio art projects could be described as heavy-handed polit­ical pieces. Consider the work of the artists he knows personally: Meeg Conroy's rainbow ethnography, Katie Monahan's meditation on our image-flooded culture, Vanessa Valenzuela's delicately penciled constellation of family portraits. Mack Russell's triptych of photographs (the "homosexuality" piece?) is a luminous techni­cal feat. 
Second of all, many of the projects he refers to -those regarding worker's rights, for one -are works of graphie design. The graphic designer has failed if he or she hasn't unambiguously expressed a message. BFA Carolin Hubscher's minimal, story­driven work for the Campus Labor Action Project offers a fme example of socially­oriented graphic design that never sinks to crass, in-your-face tactics; rather it appeals to our humanity, by giving the spotlight to workers' stories, rather than translating treatises onto the canvas, or performing bloodless experiments with craft.

Iraq pullout not logical 
Finish what you start. That's what my mother always taught me about life. This same motto can be applied to national policy. In the April 18 Letter to the Editor "Lives lost to wasted cause in Iraq," the authors claim that "The entire war [in Iraq] is a waste." They claim the United States needs to pull out to save human life and honor the lives of soldiers that could die if the war continued. 
Pulling out of Iraq is possibly the worst thing the government could do right now. There have been talks of people looking for a gradual withdraw­al plan. That sounds strangely familiar doesn't it? That's right, we learned about it in history in reference to the Vietnam War. OK, yeah that's great; we ean put the Iraq wall right next to the one for Vietnam while meanwhile leav­ing another eountry in ruin. 
Out of all the unstable countries in that area Iraq has the best chance of being a stable modern country, and it is because of the billions of U.S. dollars flowing into it to help it rebuild. Yes, that money could be going to other things more self-serving, but take a look at the Marshall Plan. In 1947, 13 billion dollars were given to several countries in Europe to help them recover from WWII. I'm pretty sure that was as huge an amount then as we're spending now, but those coun­tries are in good shape thanks to us. 
As for Vietnam, it's possible we did all we could there, but maybe if we'd stayed and won the war Vietnam it wouldn't still be considered a develop­ing country. So go ahead, withdraw our troops from Iraq and cut off fund­ing. I'm sure all the soldiers who have died would much rather we build another memorial rather than actually finish what we started, so they will not have died for no reason. 
I'm sure that 30 years down the road, I can buy a scarf for a couple of buc"ks to help some charity organiza­tion fight poverty in Iraq.

You can hear them before you see them. The sound of piano keys clinking out show tunes mixes with the hubbub of excited cast chit-chat and the melodies of performers warming up their vocal chords, rising to a loud, pleasant din that fills the LaFortune Ballroom. 
It's a Monday night rehearsal for "Beyond the Curtain," the sixth annual Musical Hevue from the Pasquerilla East Musical Company, and with just three days before opening night, directors Brad Laney and Wendy Pepper have their hands full. 

After a quick round of warm-up chords (led by th~ seemingly tireless Nicholas Shaneyfelt, the show's musical director and the man behind the piano), Pepper announces it's time to get this show on the road. "All right," she shouts, "let's go, and we're going to try to run this rehearsal as ifit were an actual show." 

While she watches the rehearsal, lwr fellow director Laney has time for a few questions. So why the title, "Beyond the Curtain?" 
"The inspiration for the show comes from a song in the musical "Chorus Linn" called 'What I Did For Love,"' Laney said. "The title felt very appropriate because through all of the experiences the pnople in the show have had with theater, we've 
all come to. realizo that we all do what we do for the lovo of theater. 
"The show's themes are all about people's 
...,~-...,:....J ·experiences with musical theater at ND and how those experiences helped make them into the people they arc today." 
The show is structured around different cate­gories and is inter­spersed with quotes from the actual cast mem­bers talking about 
how theater has impacted their lives beyond the stage. 
Featuring over 25 acts from more than 20 different musicals, "Beyond the Curtain" features nearly 40 young ladies

these are just the cream of the crop. 
Auditions for "Beyond the Curtain" were held the week before spring break over a two-night span. More than 100 acts auditioned before the final number was whittled down to less than half the original count. 
With a surplus of talented thespians here at Notre Dame, the show's title, "Beyond the Curtain," puts the spotlight on people who aro sometimes overlooked. 
"One of the reasons we chose to do this show is that with so many talented people here at Notre Dame, not everyone gets a chance to be featured onstage," Laney said. "This way, you can really feature 
plain fun. As cast 
member Erin O'Shea put it, "It's cool because you come in knowing a group of familiar faces, and then you find out it's a good way to build a community of friends. It's always enter­taining and the best part is not doing homework and watching the other acts. I always bring a book to rehearsal and never read it." 
The opening number from the show is "One Night Only," a song from the musical "Dreamgirls." Fortunately for undergrad­uates here at Notre Dame, we have three nights to take in the voices and acting on display in "Beyond the Curtain."

Assistant Scene Editor 
Love him or hate him for his personal antics, there is no doubt that Mel Gibson has been associated with some of the most spectacular and talked-about movies of the past several decades. His recent scandal has perhaps marred his populari­ty in regards to his latest film, "Apocalypto," as well as his future movies, but his older films are still a testa­ment to his talent as both an ·actor and director. 
The new DVD release of "Mel Gibson: Ultimate Collection" takes three of these classic films -"Braveheart." "Payback" and "We Were Soldiers" -and groups them in a three-disc collection for fans of the Australian actor to enjoy. 
+Braveheart (1995) 

This picture, which won Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director (it was also directed by Gibson), is by far the best film in the collection. Gibson stars as William Wallace, a Scottish king who rallies his people to overthrow the oppressive English rule under which they live. 
"Braveheart" is at once a historical epic and a moving romance. Superb acting combines with stunning cinematography and well-choreographed tight scenes to make this Gibson's best film and also one of the top fllms of all time. 
While this DVD itself is no different from the previously released standalone ver­sion, it contains good extras such as a commentary from Gibson and a lengthy documentary that details the difficulties in shooting on location in Scotland. 


+Payback: Straight Up the Director's Cut (1999) 
The second DVD in the pack is the gem of the three, as it contains the newly released director's cut of "Payback." Here, Gibson plays Porter, the bad guy -albeit a likable one -for once, a career crimi­nal who is double crossed by his accom­plices and left for dead. When Porter does not die, he exacts vengeance on his for­mer compatriots in an unforgettable fash-. ion. 
Director Brian Helgeland's original film, while suspenseful and entertaining, became overly simplified and cheery at the mandate of studio executives who feared the original cut was too sophisti­cated and dark for audiences. While the result was good, it felt empty and trite in finished form. 
The director's cut is substantially better than the original release and features much more engaging dialogue along with a darker tone that shows a different side of Gibson. Special features include an interesting new documentary about the making of the director's cut. This disc alone makes the entire set worth purchas­ing. 
+We Were Soldiers (2002) 



"Payback" stars Gibson, accompanied by Gregg Henry and Lucy Liu, as a criminal out for revenge against those who double-crossed him. 
Although certainly not a bad film, "We Were Soldiers" is the weakest of the three in this set. Gibson stars as Lt. Col. Hal Moore, a general who must lead his troops into a place called "The Valley of Death" during the Vietnam War. This true story focuses on Moore's heroism and courage in what was one of the most vio­lent battles in U.S. history. 
While this film is epic on the level of "Braveheart" -and well shot at that -it comes off as cold and lacking the heart so aptly included in Gibson's earlier film. Many critics often term this "Braveheart 3" for its similarities to the predecessor ("The Patriot" is considered "Braveheart 2") and comparisons to any such great film will usually fall short. 
As with "Braveheart," the special fea­tures are the same as on the regular standalone DVD, the best of which is a behind-the-scenes documentary that shows how many of the film's complex helicopter scenes were actually filmed. While perhaps not as worthy of inclusion in this three-pack as "The Patriot," "We Were Soldiers" is an adequate war film that showcases Mel Gibson's talent in act­ing in epic movies. 
It is within this epic genre that Mel Gibson has proven himself one of the most talented actors in recent years, continual­ly churning out thrilling, exciting films. The "Ultimate Collection DVD" showcases these three in all their bloody, gory glory.

AVONDALE Bill Murray ate a char-broiled Louisiana oyster as he walked toward the 18th green, then hurled the shell into a water hazard, shout­ing, "Now go and grow oth­ers!" 
He flexed his biceps after his chip up a steep embank­ment landed on the green, then pointed at the sky after a two-putt, his typically goofy antics amusing the gallery at a charity pro-am event preceding the PGA Tour's latest stop at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans. 
It was more than a trivial moment of levity for course officials at the TPC Louisiana, where there wasn't much to laugh about after Hurricane Katrina tore through here 19 months ago. 
This was supposed to be the course that would secure New Orleans' spot on the PGA Tour calendar. Instead, it hosted only one Zurich Classic before Katrina toppled about 2,000 trees along the fair­ways, scattered drain-clog­ging debris and left numer­ous fairways under water. 
The public course was closed for 10 months, forc­ing the PGA to go back to English Turn so a rebuild­ing New Orleans could keep its economically vital tour 
IN BRIEF 

Riley benches Heat super­
stars for season finale 
ORLANDO -Shaquille O'Neal and Dwyane Wade were inactive for the Miami Heat's regular-sea­son finale in Orlando on Wednesday night. 
"We have to be realistic with their health," Heat coach Pat Hiley said. "Other guys need work. We're going to play it out and get ready for this weekend." 
Riley made the decision strictly to avoid getting his two stars hurt before the playoffs open this weekend. When Riley was coach­ing the Los Angeles Lakers in 1983, he lost forward James Worthy to a broken leg in the final week of the season -one of the reasons, he thinks, why those Lakers were unable to defend their title. 
He isn't taking any risks with the two most important players for the defending NBA champion Heat. 
dates in 2006. After about $2 million in repairs, even a few improvements, the pros have returned to the dis­tinctive TPC Louisiana, a Pete Dye-designed course carved out of cypress swamp. 
"Obviously there was some devastation here and there was a lot of money spent to get this golf course up to speed," David Toms, a Louisiana native and 2001 winner in New Orleans, said after a practice round. "It's very important for the whole country not to forget this city." 
A number of players were eager to forget this place after it hosted its first PGA event in the spring of 2005. 
At about 7,600 yards, the course plays long, yet pres­ents an array of steep "pot" bunkers and other fairway obstacles that leave little margin for error on drives. 
"I can remember a couple of drives that I hit that I thought were decent shots ... and getting into spots where all I could do was chip out of the bunker side­ways," Toms recalled of his 2005 appearance here, when he missed the cut. 
At the very least, it's now easier to play a shot out of the woods, which were thinned out by Katrina, and the canopy along the edges of the fairways is less likely to interrupt the flight of the ball. 

Indiana Pacers to see changes 
afte:r disappointint season 
INDIANAPOLIS -Indiana Pacers CEO Donnie Walsh sa)d Wednesday he would meet with players and staff in the coming week regarding the team's direction after the team missed the playoffs for the first time since the 1996-97 season. 
"We are very disappointed with the season that concludes tonight." Walsh said in a statement. He said he and president of basketball operations Larry Bird would meet the rest of the week while attend­ing the NBA Board of Governors meeting and would meet with team owners through the weekend. 
"As time permits, we will also meet with all players and the bas­ketball staff," Walsh said. The meetings should conclude next week, at which time the team will make announcements regarding its future direction, the statement said. 
Ohio State freshman stars to 
coach annual spring game COLUMBUS -Talk about having a lame-duck coach. 
Basketball point guard Mike Conley Jr. will be an honorary head roach in Ohio State's annual intrasquad Scarlet vs. Gray spring football game on Saturday. 
Conley, along with high school dass­mate and friend Greg Oden, led the Buckeyes to a 35-4 record and the national championship game. Now he, Oden and a third freshman, Daequan Cook, are contemplating jumping to the NBA 
Conley said he was looking forward to being in charge of the Scarlet's offense. 
"I play my share of video games," he said Wednesday. "I like to get up and down the field with the passing game. I'll mix in some run plays here and there as well." 
Football coach Jim Tressel said he wasn't trying to hide the fact that he wanted to keep Conley and the other freshmen at Ohio State.

Buehrle pitches a no­hitter during Sox win 
Associated Press 

CHICAGO ~ Mark Buehrle pitched the first no-hitter of the season Wednesday night -and he was nearly perfect, too. 
The Chicago White Sox left­bander faced the minimum 27 batters in a 6-0 victory over the Texas Rangers, picking off the only hitter he walked and throwing his team's first no-hit­ter since 1991. 
Working quickly and efficient­ly in a dominant performance, Buehrle allowed only one baserunner. He walked Sammy Sosa with one out in the fifth inning, then promptly picked him off first base. 
"I can't believe I did it," Buehrle said. "Perfect game would have been nice, too." 
With the crowd on its feet in the ninth, Buehrle struck out Matt Kata and Nelson Cruz, then got Gerald Laird to hit a slow grounder to third base that Joe Crede picked up and threw to first. As Paul Konerko caught the ball, he pumped his fist, setting off a wild celebra­tion. 
Buehrle was mobbed by teammates at the side of the mound, including catcher A.J. Pierzynski, and then got a big hug from manager Ozzie Guillen as he came off the field. 
On a chilly 40-degree night, Buehrle threw 105 pitches. His previous low-hit game was a one-bitter against Tampa Bay on Aug. 3, 2001. It was the 16th no-hitter in White Sox history and first since Wilson Alvarez threw one at Baltimore on Aug. 11, 1991. 
"I was part of one in high school," Buehrle said. "To get through a big league lineup three times, I never thought it would happen." 
It was the first no-hitter pitched against the Rangers since June 17, 1995, when Toronto's David Cone threw one in a 4-0 win. 
More than two years passed without a no-hitter in major league baseball before rookie Anibal Sanchez threw one for Florida on Sept. 6, ending the longest stretch without a no-no in big league history. His gem against the Arizona Diamondbacks was the first in the majors since Arizona's Randy Johnson threw a perfect game to beat Atlanta 2-0 on May 18, 2004. 
Buehrle, who retired 20 of the final 22 batters he faced in his previous start against Oakland, had some stellar defensive plays behind him before a crowd of 25,390 at U.S. Cellular Field. 
Three of the closest plays came on grounders. Jerry Hairston hit one to Crede at third in the third inning and was called out at first after a headlong slide. Replays showed Hairston was out, but he was ejected by first base umpire James Hoye for arguing and had to be restrained by first base coach Gary Pettis when he returned to the field. 
Tadahito Iguchi made a diving stop of Hank Blalock's grounder in the hole, got up and threw him out to end the fifth. That came one batter after Sosa spoiled the perfect game bid by drawing the walk,.

Millar's double secures series win for Orioles 
Associated Press 

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -Just as they planned, the Baltimore Orioles got Scott Kazmir's pitch count up early, and that played a key role in another comeback victory. 
Erik Bedard won his third straight start, Kevin Millar hit a tiebreaking double and the Orioles beat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 6-4 on Wednesday. 
Millar's fifth-inning double off reliever Gary Glover (0-1) gave Baltimore a 4-3 lead. Millar then scored to make it 5-3 when Jon Knott, who singled, was tagged out in a rundown between first and second. 
Kazmir. the Devil Rays' No. 1 starter, departed after throwing 102 pitches through four innings. 
"I thought we did a great job of laying off a lot of pitches, and he didn't have his good stuff," Baltimore manager Sam Perlozzo said. "We got his pitch count up there. It was some­thing we looked at. I had an eye on it from the third, fourth inning, hopefully that we could keep getting him up there with pitches and get him out of the ballgame." 
The Orioles won twice -both times coming from behind -in the three-game series. Baltimore is 8-4 since being swept in a season-opening three-game series at Minnesota. 
Bedard (3-1) gave up four runs and seven hits in 5 2-3 innings. He struck out eight and walked three during a 110­pitch outing. 
Chad Bradford got out of the sixth before John Parrish and Danys Baez each pitched a hit­less inning. Chris Ray struck out all three batters in the ninth for his fifth save in six opportu­nities.

McCallie next Duke coach 
Associated Press 
Joanne P. McCallie was hired as Duke's women's basketball coach, leaving Michigan State and following the AP national coach of the year at one of the country's premier programs. 
She guided the Spartans to the 2005 national champi­onship game and succeeds Gail Goestenkors, who left for Texas. McCallie informed Michigan State's the year award from The Associated Press. 
"The entire McCallie family is absolutely thrilled about the opportunity to serve at Duke," McCallie said. "This has been a dream job of mine for many years. We cannot wait to meet and get to know a team that we are so very impressed by aca­demically, as well as athletical­ly, and by the way (they) carry 
themselves."

Duke coach 
"She elevated the Michigan State program to a new level, and we look forward to her continuing the tremendous tradition we have established at Duke," Duke athletic direc­tor Joe Alleva said.  
The 41-year-old McCallie leaves the Spartans less than a month after signing a new con­tract that boosted her base salary by about $100,000, and two years after the best season in school history. 
Michigan State won a school­record 33 games in 2005 and capped a memorable season by reaching the national champi­onship game. The run earned McCallie the national coach of ry. Duke finished 
32-2 -an NCAA-

record seventh straight 30-win season. 
She led Duke to five straight ACC tournament champi­onships from 2000-04, 13 con­secutive NCAA tournaments and at least two wins in each appearance in the NCAAs since 1997. 
Duke has reached the nation­al championship game twice, most recently in 2006, and fin­ished this season No. 1 in the final AP poll of the season. Now, the Blue Devils are count­ing on McCallie to help them take the next step -their first national title.

She leaves Michigan State after going 149­75 in seven seasons there, and reaching the past five NCAA tournaments. The Spartans' season came to an abrupt end with a 70-57 loss to Rutgers in the seeond round. 
"We deeply appreeiate the time, energy and effort that Joanne put into building a Big Ten eontender and for plaeing MSU women's basketball on the national map," Michigan State athletie direetor Hon Mason said. "She has built a solid foundation for the pro­gram." 
After being rumored as a eandidate for several high-pro­file jobs, McCallie signed a five­year contraet worth $500,000 a year plus a possible $143,000 in incentives on March 24 ­eoineidentally, the same day Duke's season ended with a last-seeond loss to those same Scarlet Knights in the regional semifinals. · 
Shortly after that, Texas offered the job to Goestenkors and she deliberated for about a week before accepting it this month, ending her 15-year run with the Blue Devils. California's Joanne Boyle, a former Duke player, turned down the job last week and agreed to a seven-year con­tract with the Golden Bears. 
McCallie becomes the second straight Duke coach with ties to the state of Michigan. Goestenkors is a Waterford, Mich., native who played at Saginaw Valley State.

No. 6 Irish drop match in Nashville 
PHIL HUDELSON!The Observer 
Sophomore Shannon Burke charges down the field in Notre Dame's 15-7 win at home over Duquesne April 1. 
Irish fall 13-9 on road to No. 14 Vanderbilt, Commodores' seniors 
By MICHAEL BRYAN Sports Writer 
Vanderbilt's seniors played an inspired final home game Wednesday, defeating No. 6 Notre Dame 13-9 in Nashville, Tenn. 
In a game that was close throughout, the Commodores and Irish were wrapped up in a 9-9 tie with just 15 minutes remaining. Vanderbilt scored the final four goals in the last few minutes to take the victory. 
The No. 14 Commodores, who honored their five gradu­ating seniors before the con­test, picked up their second vic­tory over a top-1 0 opponent with the win over the Irish. Vanderbilt also defeated then­No. 6 Penn State on the road in March. 
The Commodores (10-4) held the advantage over the Irish (11-4) from the start, taking a 4-1 lead early in the game. Notre Dame was unfazed how­ever, and came back to tie the game at five apiece late in the first half. A goal by Anastasia Adam gave Vanderbilt a 6-5 lead heading into halftime. 
Both teams traded goals early in the second half and the lead swayed in both directions. Sophomore Jillian Byers' third goal of the afternoon tied the game at nine before Vanderbilt's run to close out the game. 
Four of the Commodores' five graduating seniors scored on the game, and the exception, defender Molly Frew, helped the Vanderbilt back line hold the Irish to 16 shots. 
Senior Kendall Thrift, the Commodore's all-time assist leader, tallied four points on the game with two goals and two assists. Fellow seniors Jennifer Tapscott, Nicole Pugno, and Ali Lemons each recorded at least two points each. 
The Irish were led offensively by Byers, who netted three goals to go along with an assist. Sophomore Jane Stoeckert also contributed three goals and senior Lena Zentgraf had a goal and two assists in the loss. 
Vanderbilt out-shot the Irish 34-16, and Notre Dame goal­keeper Erin Goodman recorded 12 saves. Commodores goalie Brooke Shinaberry had five saves. 
Two Notre Dame records were set in the game. With her three goals, Byers reached 50 goals on the season for the sec­ond time in her career -a first in Irish history. In addition, junior Caitlin McKinney set a record when she extended her point-streak to 37 straight games. 
Notre Dame will look to rebound Saturday at home when the Irish face No. 18 Rutgers in the last match of the regular season. The Irish, cur­rently tied with Georgetown and Syracuse for first place in the Big East, can potentially win the Big East regular season championship and the No. 1 seed in the inaugural Big East Tournament with a victory.

Bargar, Fuemmeler guide Irish to no-hitter 
Irish aces lead team to no-hitterfrom mound, offense pushes in win 
By LORENZO REYES Sports Writer 
The story of the afternoon was the corroboration between Notre Dame's two aces, sophomore Brittney Bargar and senior Kenya Fuemmeler, for a no-hitter against Ball State in a 3-0 winWednesday. 
The blanking improved Bargar's record to 15-7 on the season, and marked the 3 3rd no-hit showing for Notre Dame in school history. The last no-hit game was delivered by former pitcher Heather Booth over Rutgers last April. 
The exciting non-confer­ence win improved the Irish to a 23-14 overall record and 
was their third win in a row. while Ball State dropped to 15-26 on the season. 
Bargar's only blemishes were two walks through six innings pitched, while she struck out seven. To seal the victory and earn a save, Fuemmeler struck one batter out in the last inning to make history for both pitchers. They now have each taken part in two no-hitters in their careers. 
The Irish bats also would take some credit for the win. 
Senior Stephanie Brown added two more runs in the game for a season total of 
33. She also went two-for­three and had the first hit of the game, which took place in the opening frame. 
After a pair of sacrifices, including a bunt and a fly out, Brown scored the first run of the game on a throw­ing error by Ball State. Although the Irish would not need another run, they added

Belles look to regain tnotnentutn at Goshen 
By REBECCA SLINGER 
Sports Writer 
When Saint Mary's faces Goshen College this after­noon, the Belles will look to regain their dominance from earlier this season, when they went 9-1 during a spring break trip to Fort Myers, Fla. 
The numbers haven't been looking good for Saint Mary's lately after three straight losses -two of those by just one point. But the team hopes to reverse that trend against Goshen (5-16). which strug­gled against the Belles (14-6) last year. 
First-year head coach Linda Bontrager took Goshen to a 2-28 record in 2006. The Belles swept the Leafs last year 9-1 and 6-1. 
The Leafs are still strug­gling to find a way to win in the 2007 sea­son. With six freshmen and only one sen­

The Belles are facing some of their own struggles with a 1-5 MIAA conference record. 
"We're taking it one game at a time and we're going to use our games today in preparation ... [and see] what we need to change for our next conference games," jun­ior captain McKenna Corrigan said. "We're not even halfway done with con­ference play, so there's still a lot of ball to play." 
To take on the Leafs, the Belles will use their combina­tion of power hitting· and accurate pitching. Freshman Ashley Peterson, sophomore Kristin Amram and senior Sarah Miesle lead the Belles with batting averages of .433, .429 and .391, respectively. 
Amram has been a domi­nant force not only at the plate but also on the mound. The sophomore has pitched consistently to a 1.22 ERA. Sophomore pitcher Calli 
little help. 
When the Leafs turned to sophomore Haly Williamson and junior Tera Brackman against Spring Arbor University on April 10, the two allowed 13 hits and 12 runs in the 12-4 loss. 
However, the Belles aren't counting the Leafs as a "w" on their schedule just yet. 
"We really want to win and we're not taking any team lightly because we haven't been playing as consistently as we thought we would," freshman second baseman Maureen Healy said. "We're not taking any team for granted."

Goshen can help the team get hack on track. 
"Right now it doesn't matter what a team's record is. A win is a win," she said. "We know we can beat any team we've faced so far. . .. We just have to be consistent in win­ning games. [Beating] Goshen would be a confidence boost­er but it wouldn't be anything that would shock us." 
Saint Mary's takes on Goshen College in Goshen, Ind. at 3:30 p.m. today.

two more in the third frame. 
Junior Brittany Glynn start­ed the third with a single and then moved to second on a bunt single from Brown to the shortstop. After a sacri­fice bunt and a throwing error, Glynn crossed the plate and Brown advaneed to third. Freshman Christine Lux then drove the senior home with an RBI off a field­er's choice. 
Nutre Dame threatened again in the fifth with back­to-hack hits, but no runs were seored when Ball State was able to thwart the rally. 
Ball State had a walk in the sixth inning, but that was all the stingy Irish pitching allowed for the rest of the game. 
Notre Dame's next game is today against Valparaiso in a make-up eontest at Ivy Field at 5 pm.

like that," Irish fifth-year catcher Matt Weglarz said. 
Elam finished with nine strikeouts and allowed just one hit in his nine full innings of work, while low­ering his ERA to 3.75. 
Elam and Bischoff ended up with no-decisions, as both left with the game scoreless after nine. For the Boilermakers, freshman southpaw Matt Jansen came in to work the 1Oth and retired the first two batters. 
But Weglarz hit a double over third base, then went to third on a wild pitch. Irish senior first baseman Mike Dury then walked to bring up centerfielder Danny Dressman. Dressman lined a single that dropped in front of Purdue leftfielder Spencer Ingaldson to drive in the game's lone run with only the fourth hit of the contest. 
"I got a fastball, and I was just trying to get on top of it," Dressman said. "I was able to hit it hard." 
The Boilermakers did threaten several times, but Elam was able to get out of each jam. He walked a pair of batters in the first before inducing a grounder to Irish shortstop Brett Lilley to end the inning. He also surren­dered a walk before picking off the runner in the fourth. 
Elam ran into trouble again when he walked Ingaldson to lead off the sixth. Ingaldson moved to second on a wild pitch then reached third on a sacrifice bunt by Boilermakers right fielder Alex Jaffee. With one out, the Irish pulled the infield in and Elam got Boilermakers designated hitter Ryan White to ground to Barnes, who held the run­ner at third before recording the out. 
"[Elam] had a very live fastball and pitched out of a couple of big jams," Irish coach Dave Schrage said. 
The next batter, first base­man, Jeff Mojzik, walked before he stole second. With men on second and third, Purdue third baseman Dan Black drilled a line drive up the middle that appeared to be headed into centerfield for a two-run single. But Lilley dived to knock the liner down and fired to first to nab Black by a half-step. 
But the Irish were unable to gain any momentum from Lilley's play. In their half of the sixth, all three Irish bat­ters struck out looking. 
After Elam retired the side in order the next inning, the scoreboard still displayed all zeroes as the Irish came to bat and looked to end Bischoff's bid for a perfect game. 
With one out in the bottom of the seventh, Irish third baseman A.J. Pollock hit a hard grounder between first 
and second base. But Bischoff got his 19th straight out on a diving stab by the first baseman Mojzik, who flipped to the pitcher to retire Pollock at first. Bischoff, who was scheduled to work only three innings, then got Irish leftfielder Ross Brezovsky to fly out to left to end the inning. 
In the eighth, Bischoff again got a boost from his defense. With one out in the Irish half of the inning, Dury lined a full-count pitch from Bischoff into the left-center­field gap that hung up just long enough for centerfield­er Jon Moore to run it down. Bischoff pointed out at his teammate in a gesture of gratitude before retiring Irish centerfielder Danny Dressman to end the inning. 
Elam responded by retir­ing Purdue in order in the ninth. After striking out Boilermakers shortstop John Cummins for the third out with his 122nd pitch of the contest, Elam pumped his fist as he ran off the mound. 
"I felt like it was our time right there," Elam said. "We didn't do it in the ninth, but we were able to get it done in the tenth and that's all that matters." 
Irish junior right-hander Tony Langford did not give up a hit as he worked the lOth to get the win. He is now 2-0 on the season.

more. The tough defense by Dan Myers combined with the team's stellar offensive ball movement from Ala Rack Bar led to the final score of 21-2. 
The Dead James Browns seemed to have high expec­tations for this game. 
"It was disappointing because this is a sport we die for," The Dead James Brown player John Siegel said. "We went into this game with a two-game, no-points-allowed winning streak -one was a bye and one was a forfeit. We had high expectations for this game, but we just didn't turn on our hibachi." 
M u n n in g hoff had some final words on the team's plan for its next game. 
"If you beat the Georgia bulldog, you're gonna feel that bulldog might," he said. 
Hide the Women and Children 21, Team 327 4 
The off-campus team for­merly from Knott, Hide the Women and Children, had a simple strategy that allowed it to dominate Team 327 in a 21-4 victory Wednesday. 
"Our plan is easy," Hide the Women and Children's Jack Arkins said. "Score more points and allow less." 
Team 327, however, entered the game with a more complex plan. 
"We're going to drive it down the lane and use a zone defense," Team 327 player Brett Thomas said. "Oh, yeah, and lots of dunks." 
From the first play of the game, fast breaks from Arkins put his team into the lead. Kyle Meade's outside jump shots combined with Eamonn Bahnson's top of the key baskets to push Hide the Women and Children into the early lead. By halftime, Hide the Women and Children's superior defense allowed Team 327 just one basket, bringing the score to 11-1 . 
Team 327 decided to change its tactics in the sec­ond half, switching from zone to man-to-man defense. While the change in strategy allowed 327 to gain a few more points, it was still unable to stop Matt Levering, 
who dominated the lane for 
Hide  the  Women  and  
Children.  
Hide  the  Women  and  
Children also  had  a  com­ 

manding defense led by Meade and Doug Mahoney, who intercepted the ball and gained several points off fast breaks. 
"Our legs were really fresh after that long weekend," Mahoney said. "We had some raw defense." 
Hide the Women and Children hopes to continue its winning streak into the next round and deep into the tournament, all while using the same simple strategy ­. score more points and allow less. 
Smush Parker: The Prequel 
21, Wabruda's Freedom 
Fighters 15 
This intense match-up of two highly skilled teams was framed by a large and enthu­siastic crowd of dedicated fans that created an intense atmosphere. 
Once the game began, it took awhile for players on both teams to acclimate to playing on a slippery court with a wet ball. Many play­ers missed passes and slid out of bounds as a steady rain fell. 
"It looks like they're play­ing on ice," Smush Parker fan Bobby Polish said. 
Smush Parker made the initial point before the momentum of the game shift­ed back and forth. The Wabruda team put on an impressive show with their "in-your-face" style of defense. Floyd Rose, of the Wabruda team, was an espe­cially strong presence on the court. 
In the end, Smush Parker used their height to prevail over the Freedom Fighters. Much of Smush Parker's suc­cess late in the game could be attributed to the play of Ryan Winiarski and to Mike Wakim. 
After the heartbreaking loss, Wabruda team member William David William kept a positive outlook. 
"We're freedom fighters," he said. "Tonight we were fighting for injustice through athletics. We're going to con­tinue fighting politically."

Zbikowski, who will enter his fourth year starting next fall, has already been named a captain for the 2007 season. 
"He's earned and deserved at this point to be kind of con­sidered the leader back there," secondary coach Bill Lewis said. 
At the other safety spot, vacated by the graduation of Chinedum Ndukwe, things are much less clear. Rising juniors Bruton, Ray Herring and Kyle McCarthy and rising sopho­
mores  Sergio  Brown  and  
Jashaad Gaines are  all  con­ 
tending for the spot.  

Lewis said most of those five have been working out at both safety positions, in order to maximize flexibility in the defensive backfield. 
"We're kind of rolling guys to both sides because what we eventually want is the eleven best guys on the field," he said. 
Bruton said the competition has benefited everyone involved. 
"It's helping us as individu­als," he said. "We're trying to get on the field and trying to get better. It's friendly between all of us, but it's busi­ness on the field. May the best man win." 
Lewis said that competition may continue well into next season, once he and Brown see who responds in a game situation. But in order to make the best decision, hR said, the coaching staff is try­ing to create as many game­like situations as possible in practice. 
"The one thing about the NFL is you have four presea­son games that are truly prac­tice games to get better," he said. "We don't enjoy that lux­ury." 
At corner, Lambert returns after starting most of last sea­son. He made 40 tackles and was second on the team with three interceptions, including two against Michigan State, one of which he ran back for the winning touchdown. 
Opposite him will most likely be Wooden, who appeared in nine games and made 21 tack­les during his injury-plagued 2006 campaign. In 2005, Wooden was the full-time starter and was third on the team in tackles with 74. He also had two interceptions. 
When the Irish go to five and six defensive backs. Brown and Lewis expect to send out some combination of cornerbacks rising senior Leo Ferrine, rising sophomores Darrin Walls and Raeshon McNeil and early-entry fresh­man Gary Gray, if he recovers enough from the injury he sustained earlier this spring. · 
But the coaches aren't rul­ing out using a safety at nickel or dime back. · 
"Usually it's a corner," Lewis said. "But if the next best guy is a safety, I want the next best guy to be on nickel."

they will face either Seton 

Irish as they prepare for another diffi­cult test Friday. At this point, Louderback said the most important thing his team can do is get plenty of repetitions outdoors, played quite a few singles and doubles points [Tuesday] just to get good outdoors. We'll probably do quite a bit of playing the next few days." 
When asked what it would be like to win the Big East championship for the third consecutive year, Louderback was hesitant to look too far into the future. 
"It would be nice, Louderback said. "I think it's going to be tough because there are some good teams for our first match, and then if we win that, it could be Marquette or West Virginia. We just played Marquette but three of their kids were out of the lineup, and if they're back in the lineup, they're dangerous.

of rest and practice the team can get will be beneficial. 
"That's really good," Louderback said of the bye. "Getting that bye also gives us an extra day to practice good idea of what to expect. 
"I haven't really had a chance to look at them yet," Louderback said. "We just found out the draw yester­day, and I'll get a chance to see them play I todayI. but we really haven't seen much of them at all this season. We'll know better Itoday1." 
Practice will be key for the

Louderback has not been able to see much of either team so far this season, but after he watches today's match, he hopes to have a

No. 2 Irish head to Florida as No. 1 seed in Big East tournament 
-
By DAN MALOOF 
Sporrs Writer 
After another remarkable regular season, the Irish will take their 23-2 record into the Big East tournament today as a No. 1 seed for the 11th time in the team's 12 years in the con­ference. 
In addition, Notre Dame has reached the finals of the tour­nament all 11 years and won the championship seven times, including the last two years. Historically, the Irish have won 38 of 40 matches against cur­rent Big East opponents. 
Although the team is getting used to being the No. 1 seed in the tournament, it is still very honored by the distinction, Notre Dame coach Jay Louderback said. 
"We had been [the No. 1 seed] for a few years so I think our kids are used to it," 
,.-
Louderback said. "It just reflects what a good season we've had and how well we've played this year.:· 
On Friday, the Irish rebound­ed nicely from an upset defeat to Northwestern by soundly beating DePaul and Marquette. The loss to Northwestern was the team's first in 17 matches. 
Regarding health issues, Louderback said that aside from a few small lingering injuries, the team should pretty much be at full strength. 
"We'll be all right," Louderback said. "[.Junior! Brook Buck is probably going to play some doubles this week, and we're just going to wait and see. She went through full practice today and was a little sore but not too bad, and then we _have just a few other nicks, but I think we should have all of our players." 
The Irish have three days ofT before the tournament begins and also have a bye in the first round, which gives them one more day between matches. Louderback said any extra day

Simple strategy guides 
Ala Rack Bar to win 
By ELLYN MICHALAK and

Sports Writers 
With determination and hard work, Ala Rack Bar dominated the Dead James Browns 21-2 in a fast-paced match Wednesday. 
Prior to the game, Ala Rack Bar captain Mark Munninghoff offered up the team's strategy. 
"We're going to try to get up and down the court, play good 'D,' and get out of here quickly," Munninghoff said. 
With numerous fast breaks by Munninghoff, and outside shots by Dan Bertao, Ala Hack Bar was able to hold The Dead James Browns to only one point in the first half. Chris Wodicka was the only Dead James Brown player to score in the first half. His outside jump shot left the halftime score at 11­1. 
Ala Rack Bar continued to dominate in the second half, allowing the Dead James Browns to score only once
