Fair attracts businesses to campus 

By JENNIFER ROWLING New' Writer 
Notre D a nH~ 's ann u a I career fair will be held today in the North Dome of the .Ioyce CenlPr from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m., showcasing a variety of businesses to seniors and interested studonts. 
Tlw College of' Business has been sponsoring this event for I I years. and the Career CPnter became 'involved thn~e years ago. This year's fair n1arks the first to be sup­ported by the College of Bu?iness, the Carner Center, the MBA program and busi­nl~ss clubs, as well. 
The fair. featuring 101 par­ticipant companies, is the second-largest Business Career Fair Notre Dame has hosted since 2000 and is the lnading career fair in the Midwest. 
"We arc pleased with this number." said Lee Svete, director of the Career Center. "We have many new corhpa· nies that continue to seek out Notre Dame students in a down market, and this is a testament to the quality of our student body".

Six months ago, the Office of Information Technologies completed a major overhaul of the University's e-mail sys­tem. installing four new e­mail servers. Since that time, the e-mail system survived a major virus attack that affect­ed computers worldwide and likely would have completely crippled the previous e-mail system. 
Paul Hussell. senior systems administrator at orr. said that the virus outbreak makes it diflicult to directly compare the performance of the new system to the old one. 

Several well-known compa­nies attending the fair include Morgan Stanley, IBM, Motorola, Bank One, Bain & Company and BP. 
Svete encourages all stu­dents to attend the career fair. regardless of major or graduation year. 
"1 know of at least 25 com­panies looking for all differ­ent majors," he said. 
Specific companies men­tioned that they are seeking students with a major or minor in computer applica­tions, economics, govern­ment, foreign language and law, Svete said. Internship applications will also br available at the fair, especial­ly for students interf)sted in accounting and banking fields. 
For graduating and job­seeking students, the majori­ty or participating companies have positions and applica­tions available. However, a few companies arc skeptical as to whether or not they are hiring until spring 2004.

On Aug. 19 at 7 a.m .. the Sobig virus began to hit the e­mail servers and they received approximately 5,000 infected messages in the next three hours. Between then and Sept. 10, the date on which the virus attack sub­sided, the University's mail servers disinfected over 1 million c-mails that had the virus attached. 
On one day during the attack, the e-mail servers dis­infected more than twice as many e-mails as they rlid dur­ing the entire month of June, which had previously been the month with the largest number of detected viruses.

ND student smokers may face restrictions 
By MIKE CHAMBLISS News Writer 
Feel like going outside for a smoke? Within the next few years, when students feel like going outside for a smoke, they may have to travel off campus to do so. According to duLac state­ments about the University smoking policy, an entirely smoke-free campus may lie in Notre Dame's future. 
Smoking is currently pro­hibited in all Notre Dame buildings. Although the poli­cy states that smoking in individual residence hall rooms is permitted with the consent of the room's resi­dents, the separate rules of each Notre Dame residence hall prohibit smoking alto­gether. This places Notre Dame in the minority among American universities. 
According to a Harvard School of Public Health sur­vey, 73 percent of colleges provide some form of smok­ing option in residence halls. 
Hegular smokers constitute a small percentage of Notre Dame's on-campus students; 
9.5 percent of students living on campus smoke three times a week or more, com­pared to the national aver­age of 24 percent. according to the Office of Alcohol and Drug Education. Although 

the percentage of smokers is relatively small, with approximately 6,200 stu­dents living on campus, the number of smokers comes out to about 600. With the average residence hall hous­ing about 230 students, the figure or 600 smokers would be significant in considera­tion of smoking options for on-campus housing. 
Many regular smokers on Notre Dame's campus arc tired of facing the unpleas­ant attitudes of non-smok­ers. Leslie Fitzpatrick, a jun­ior in Pasquerilla West. has had many unsavory encoun­ters with non-smoking stu­dents. 
"I get a lot of dirty looks. I've had strangers come up to me and tell me that my smoking is disgusting," she said. 
In the winter, smokers are frequently forced away from the protection offered by buildings and into the rain and snow. 
"Even when it is cold and all the windows are closed. people come out and tell us to move away from the building," Fitzpatrick said of her smoking e,:periences outside Pasqucrilla West.

I especially liked the plethora of Big Red dressed as Blue (it was GLORI­OUS!!). On my way I asked, "Honey, do you think SOH is still open?"

Dolphin encourages Catholic diversity 
By MICHELLE EGGERS 
News Wrirer 
Sister Kathleen Dolphin, director of Saint Mary's Center for Spirituality, ques­tioned Catholic identity Tuesday in her lecture "More Than One Way to Be Catholic: Catholic Identity Revisited." 
Dolphin spoke of the rising resistance to pluralism within the Catholic Church and the importance of undfJrstanding this diversity to Catholic iden­tity and spirituality. 
"Healthy pluralism within Catholicism should be encouraged and not resisted," Dolphin said. "Diversity should be responsibly nur­tured." 
The intensity of resistance to diversity within Roman Catholicism ranges from severe hostility to mild dis­comfort, Dolphin said. These resistances are expressed in everything from the institu­tional and intellectual life of the Church to spirituality. 
This diversity is part of the Church's 2000-year tradition, providing numerous spiritual practices and a variety of the­ologies that inform these practices. Dolphin said access to good theology accounts for particular styles of spirituali­ty. 
"Spirituality is an expres­sion of a particular theology," she said. "Tneology is the systematic -that is to say, organized and coherent ­reflection upon our faith." 
Dolphin said our spirituality needs to be grounded in good faith. Exploring the notion of pluralism, or different ways to be Catholic, grants theolo­gians room to explain and develop dogmas of faith that can be applied to today's changing world. 
In the middle of this cultur­al shift, more pronounced diversity is now apparent. Dolphin explained it in scien­tific terms as being similar to the greater diversity of species that appears when two or more ecosystems col-

!ide. But a review of the Church's tradition reveals much of this diversity has 
existed  - though unrealized  
by most  - throughout histo­ 
ry.  

"The impression that many people have is that there was some golden age when every­one believed and practiced their faith in a standardized, one-size-fits-all manner," Dolphin said. 
Many community members have grown up in this "one­size-fits-all manner." She said they do not see certain aspects of their faith as ques­tionable, but they are. 
For this reason, and in light of recent world events, Dolphin feels the notion of pluralism is important to the members of this community. 
"A genuine pluralism demands that all of us stop measuring every distance from the center of our own little universe," she said 
Dolphin's lecture was the first in a three-part lecture series titled "More Than One Way to Be Catholic," spon­sored by Saint Mary's Center for Spirituality. All lectures are free and open to the pub­lic.

Mendoza reveals nevv Collllllons 
By MAUREEN REYNOLDS Associate News Editor 
The Mendoza College of Business recently unveiled its newest addition to the College, the Giovanini Commons. Not a traditional study space, the Commons serve as a place where stu­dents and professors can share in participative learn­ing. 
The idea for the Commons came from suggestions voiced by students and instructors on the need for non-traditional learning space. 
"Dean [Carolyn] Woo had heard comments on the need for a space where there could be breakout SP,SSions and a place for groups of students to study that was open and everything was moveable," said Matthew Fulcher, facility manager for the Commons. 
The Commons provide that needed environment. 
Included in the Commons is a spacious area called "the arcade," which provides general seating, open place to take students.

"We must actively pursue the benefits of multilater­ism," he told the assembled delegates. 
But the assembly is fac­ing major challenges: The wurld is bitterly divided over the U.S. occupation of Iraq. Poor nations at the World Trade Organization meeting in Mexico said they could no longer negotiate with the rich nations on farm subsidies.

Dollar, euro lose value against yen 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -On a day 
when Federal Hcscrve poli­
cy-makers deliberated 
interest rates. the focus of 
foreign-exchange markets 
was very much on a central 
bank from a di!Terent coun­
try:· Japan. 
With the yen surging 1 percent Tuesday against the dollar and 2.1 percent against the euro, investors were waiting to sec whether Japan's Ministry of Finance -which has been a dominant force in the markets of late -would once again step in to stop the yen from getting too strong and derailing the country's export-led recov­ery. 
While the dollar strength­ened against its European counterparts. its lack of good fortune against the yen rellects the fact that currency speculators were betting Japanese authori­ties would be hesitant to intervene heavily to sup­port the dollar ahead of this weekend's meeting or finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrial­ized nations. 
Against this backdrop, investors largely ignored a decision by the Federal Heserve to leave bench­mark rates on hold at a 45­year low of 1 percent, as expected. Once again, the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said rates will remain low for a "considerable period." 
While noting that mone­tary policy and productivity growth is "providing important ongoing support to economic activity," the FOMC did shift slightly from language used after its last meeting on Aug. 12, in noting that the labor market "has been weaken­ing." 
'fhe dollar softened slightly in a knee-jerk reac­tion to that, said John McCarthy, director of for­eign exchange at ING Barings Capital Markets in New York. 

But he and other traders called the decision a non­eve'lt for currency mar­kets, and the euro quickly slipped to a low of $1.1155. Meanwhile, the yen reached its strongest level in nearly two weeks against the dollar at 116.02 yen, and a week high against the euro at 129.54 yen. 
In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.1163, down from $1.1306 late Monday. The

yen late Monday. The dollar was quoted at 1.3910 Swiss francs, up from 1.3775, and 1.3704 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3648. The British pound fell to $1.5855 from $1.6021. 


The yen's strength was supported by an improved economic outlook for Japan and a continued influx of foreign capital. 
Meanwhile, the upcoming G7 meeting in Dubai has became the market's biggest focus, with curren­cy policy expected to be high on the agenda. Calls on both sides of the Atlantic have grown louder for China to remove or loosen the yuan's peg to the dollar, which officials see as sup­porting Chinese exports by keeping the currency artili­cially undervalued. 

Yet while the G7 commu­nique isn't considered like­ly to specifically target China's foreign-exchange policy, analysts expect it to echo comments made by 
U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow on his recent trip to Asia in support of flexible and market-based exchange rates. 
P&G to distribute Fair Trade coffee 
Associated Press 
CINCINNATI -Activists say they will be watching to make sure that Procter & Gamble Co. makes a strong commitment to its more expensive new line of "fair trade" cofl'ee, intend­ed to return more profits to growers. 
If the ell'ort falls short, they say, their campaigns to flood the .company with faxes. letters and e-mails will resume. 
Activists who had launched a public relations campaign and sponsored shareholder resolutions in favor of fair-trade coffee hailed P&G's decision Monday to begin selling it, noting that co!l'ee prices are at their lowest level in 50 years. 
Less than 1 percent of the coffee sold in the United States is considered fair-trade, but activists say the move­ment appears to be gaining traction. 
The Cincinnati-based company's Mountain Moonlight brand is 3.vailable online and by mail order in 10 oz. 

packages for $8.99. The coffee, part of P&G's gourmet Millstone line, is being procured by fair-trade organizations that work with companies to bypass middlemen and return a greater per­centage of the retail price to produc­ers. 
Altho1,1gh P&G is not the first big cof­fee seller to offer fair-trade products, th'e move should help encourage other companies in the industry, supporters said. 
"With world market prices as low as they are right now, we see that many coffee farmers cannot maintain their families and their land any more. We need fair trade now more than ever," said Jeronimo Bollen, director of Manos Campesinas, a coffee coopera­tive in Guatemala that markets fair­trade coffee. 
P&G spokeswoman Tonia Ilyatt said P&G was motivated both by discus­sions with activists and market research indicating that Millstone cus­tomers wanted the product. P&G had previously said fair-trade offerings were unnecessary since it was work­ing with coffee farmers to help them farm more profitably, while the com­pany supported community schools and other organizations. 
P&G is the second of the four largest 
U.S. coffee sellers to oiTer fair-trade coffee. Sara Lee Corp., whose brands include Chock Full o' Nuts and Chase & Sanborn, began selling it in 2001. Activists say they are trying to per­suade coffee giants Nestle and Kraft Foods to follow suit. Starbucks Coll'ee Co. began selling fair-trade coffee in 2000. 
The decision does not affect P&G's Folgers coffee. one of tlie company's $1 billion-a-year brands in annual sales. P&G said the sales of its Millstone brand, which usually retails for $6.99 for a 10 to 12 oz. package, are in the hundreds of millions of dol­lars per year.

Court questions tnusic subpoenas in appeal 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -A IJ.S. appeals court wrestled with questions Tuesday over whether the music industry can use special copyright sub­poenas in its campaign to track and sue computer users who download songs over the Internet. 
Judge John Roberts of the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia chal­lenged Recording Industry Association of America lawyer Donald B. Verrilli Jr. on whether computer users downloading music were any different from people who maintain libraries in their homes. 
Roberts questioned whether the fact that copyrighted files were publicly accessible on someone's computer necessar­ily means the Internet user is illegally distributing those files. File-sharing software typically stores downloaded music in a computer folder that is freely available for other Internet users to browse. 
"Isn't is equivalent to my 
leaving the do0r to my library open?" Roberts asked. "Somebody could come in and copy my books but that doesn't mean I'm liable for copyright infringement." 
Roberts and the other twu judges hearing thR case also posed tough questions for \'erizon Communications Inc., which is challenging the con­stitutionality of the subpoenas under the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act. U.S. District Judge John D. BateE' earlier had approved use of the subpoenas, forcing Vcxizon to turn over names and addresses for at least four Internet subscribers. 
"You make a lot of money off piracy," Roberts told Verizon lawyer Andrew McBride. People who download large collections of music tradition­ally favor high-speed Internet connections like those offered by Verizon's Internet sub­sidiary. 
"That is a canard," McBride shut back. He said Verizon makes money when computer users purchase songs from online services affiliated with Verizon.

NASA officials express doubt over repair kits

SI'ACJ<: CJ<:NTJ<:H. llouston -A top NASA engineer said Tunsday tlw rwxl space shuttle crnw may not be able to fix a hole the size of thn orw that brought down Columbia. despitl' accicl!mt inves­tigators' insistence on a repair kit for astronaul'>. 
ll was the first time that some­one so high within thn space ag1~ncy expressed uncertainty about tlw possibility of equipping rutllrl' shuttle astronauts with the nnc:nssary materials and tools to patch potentially deadly holes in spacecraft wings. 
"Wn'm working to the best of our ability to havn a capability for rPpair." said Steve Poulos, man­aw~r or the shuttle vehicle engi­nl'ering ollic:e. 
"Tiwn~·s nothing oil" the table" for developing a patch for the tlwrmal shielding on the leading PdgPs or tlw wings, Poulos said. "If we can make that work. that is what we' rn going to go 11y. If WC' cannot make that work, then we have som1~ decision points !hat WI' as an agency nend to sit down and talk about and decide is that a risk that we're willing to takP."

Poulos said at a return-to-llight sPminar at .Johnson Space C1mter that the "paramount" objective is to eliminate or at least minimize the amount of insulating foam and other debris shed from the external fuel tank during liftofT. But later in the afternoon, the deputy manager or NASA's exter­nal tank project, Neil Otte, told reporters it will be impossible to completely prevent foam from coming off, given the current technology. 
A chunk or foam the size of a suitcase tore a hole in Columbia's left wing 82 seconds after liftoff in January. and the gap let in the searing gases or re-entry two weeks later. The spaceship broke apart over Texas on Feb. 1, killing all seven astronauts. 
In their final report issued late last month, the Columbia acci­dent investigators urged NASA to not only eliminate 11yaway foam and othnr launch debris, but to toughen the shuttle wings and develop a plan !"or astronauts to make emergency repairs in case their ship is damaged.

Poulos said he does not know whether astronauts on the next 11ight -or any succes­sive !light-will be able to patch such a big hole given the dillicul­ty in finding a material that can adhere to the carbon composite panels on the wing edges and withstand the thousands of degrees of re-entry.

praising the deci­sion because 78 percent or girls and 60 percent of boys passed all subjects for that semester, compared with 69 percent of girls and 46 per­cent of boys when they were sixth-graders. 
"I don't think you can argue with those kinds of numbers," said Tammy llaub, the English teacher who suggested the change. 
This year, the program is being expanded throughout the school, except for honors c:lasses. 
Clarksville Middle School, located across the Ohio Hiver from Louisville, Ky.. is the only public school in Indiana that has implemented such a pro-Tuesday. "Some 
girls don't like 
it. but I do. And we all got better grades" last year, when the program start­ed. 
Critics from organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Organization for Women contend single-sex classes may violate federal rules that prohibit gender'seg­regation in all but the most limited situations, such as physical education classes involving bodily contact. 
Emily Martin, a staff attor­ney for the ACLU, said parents of students in a single-sex class could sue the school, arguing that their children were denied a nond iscrimina­tory education. 

The change at Clarksville started after llaub read research that indicated some students do better in single­gender c:lasses. She joined col­leagues and proposed the idea to Cooper. who decided to try it. 
Superintendent Sam Gardner signed orr on the project, and the program began quietly in the seventh grade last year on a trial basis. 
"Our main goal was academ­ic," llaub said. "One of the things we wanted to do was improve the percentage of boys passing all their classes." 
In the sixth grade. 54 per­cent of the boys failed at least one subject in the first semes­ter. But a year later, after a semester of single-gender instruction, only 40 percent or the same group of boys was failing at least one class, according to information com­piled by the school. 
llaub docs not believe the gains could be explained sim­ply by students growing a year older. "If anything, there tend to be even more distractions in the seventh grade," she said. 
In single-gender classes, some girls no longer worry about "looking silly" in front or boys, and some boys arc not as tempted to show off as they might with girls prcs1mt, llaub said. 
"The social pressure is off." she said, allowing students to focus on academics.

In a warning letter sent to a Detroit address main­tained by CanaHX, the FDA said the company may be endangering the health of some customers and gave the company 15 days to respond before subjecting it to prosecution. 
Albano said he believes the company's goods are safe based on the prescriptions the company supplies his family -including medica­tion for his son's diabetes. 
"I'm doing business with regulated pharmacies," he said. "If they're going to shut down CanaRx, they'd better be prepared to shut down all those buses of sen­ior citizens going to Canada" to buy pharmaceuticals. 
Albano said he told FDA officials that blocking the Springfield drug plan would backfire and erode the agency's public support. 
The city began offering in July a voluntary program to employees and retirees that would allow the city to save as much as $9 million by buying certain prescription drugs from Canada. Drug costs are dramatically cheaper there due to gov­ernment controls and a favorable exchange rate. 
The plan works the way

SPHINGFIELD, Ill. -The Illinois Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to hear Philip Morris' appeal of a $10~1 bil­lion verdict in a class-action lawsuit claiming the company misled smokers about the dangers of light cigarettes. 
The court also kept the appeal 'bond that the tobacco giant must post at about $6 billion, rather than the $12 billion set initially. Philip Morris argued the higher bond would drive it into bankruptcy and force it to default on a $206 billion, 25­year nationwide tobacco set­tlement. 
The huge bond had dam­aged the credit rating of Philip Morris' parent compa­ny, Altria Group, and forced it to cancel a share repurchase program. The prospect of los­ing the settlement ,noney also worried state officials across

The court's orders, issued without written opinions, arc the latest in a post-trial battle that started with a March decision by state Judge Nicholas Byron to charge the company $10.1 'billion for misleading Illinois smokers into believing light cigarettes are less harmful than regular brands. 
The case was the first con­sumer class-action lawsuit over light cigarettes to go to trial. 
Plaintiffs want the company to post $14.64 billion in cash or surety bonds to secure the judgment and cover interest and costs while appeals pro­ceed. 
Byron initially ordered Philip Morris to post a $12 billion bond, but later reduced that by nearly half after Philip Morris said it would be driven out of busi­ness.

Resolution fails to

reverse gay marriage 
A~soclated Press 
TOHONTO -Canada's ruling party narrowly defeated a l'arlianwnt resolution that opposes tlw government's plan to l1~galiw homosexual unions, ha n.Jy ovn reo min g d iv isions within its caucus Tuesday. 
The nonbinding resolution by tlw opposition Canadian Alliance was ddeated by a 137-132 vote in the 30 1-membnr House of Commons chamber. 
Whil1~ thn resolution had no legal weight, it was intended to fore11 Parliament members from tlH• governing Liberal Party to d11darn with their vote whether tlwy support or oppose the gov­ernnwnt plan that has divided tlw country. 
llundreds of homosexual cou­pl!~s have be1)n married in Ontario and British Columbia since courts there ruled earlier this yp;u· that the current defini­tion of marriage as between a man and woman is discrimina­tory. The government has not appealed. choosing instead to rewrite the law to define mar­riage as between two persons with no gnnder distinction. 
The draft law has been sent to thP Supreme Court. the nation's highest, for review before Parliament considers it. 
Opinion polls show the nation evenly split on the issue, and some Liberal Party members of Parliament have said they oppose the government's plan. 
The vote showed how deep the split goes, as the Liberals hold 170 seats in the llouse of Commons but could barely defeat the resolution that expressed Parliament support for the traditional definition of marriage as between a man and woman.. 
The resolution said Parliament should take "all necessary steps" to preserve the traditional defi­nition of marriage. 
Introducing it Tuesday, opposi­tion leader Stephen llarper of the conservative Canadian Alliance said the issue is about supporting traditional marriage and giving Parliament a say in the matter instead of letting the courts set policy. 
"It is about the right of the people to make social value judgments and, more specifical­ly, the fight of judgments to be made by the representatives of the people rather than by the judges appointed by the govern­ment," he said. 
In response, Justice Minister Martin Cauchon said the resolu­tion amounted to a call for the government to override human rights. 
GERMANY 

European leaders to discuss Iraq 
Associated Press 

BEHLIN --The leaders of Germany. France and Britain will meet in Berlin this week­end to try to coordinate their stands on Iraq and put their differences behind them. gov­ernment officials said Tuesday. 
Saturday's session will bring together German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and French President Jacques Chirac ­ardent opponents of the U.S.­led Iraq war -and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who fell out with the other two in the buildup to war. 
A likely topic will be the U.S. push at the United Nations for more peacekeeping troops and money for Iraq. where Washington is at odds with France, Hussia and China ­veto-wielding members of the 
U.N. Security Council, as is Britain. 
"The aim of the meeting is to agree on common foreign poli­cy positions, after views diverged in the run-up to the Iraq war," a German govern­ment statement said. 
Blair's government was par­ticularly scathing about Chirac's opposition to military intervention. Asked whether Saturday's meeting was meant to mend fences, Blair's spokesman said: "I won't deny that part of the rationale of having this summit is to look forward on Iraq." 
President Bush spoke with Blair on Monday, White I louse spokesman Scott McClellan said. 
''They did discuss the ongo­ing diplomatic efforts. including at the United Nations," and touched on Blair's upcoming meeting with Schroeder and Chirac, he said. 
Schroeder and Chirac will meet Thursday for a regular 
German-French sum­mit in Berlin. Including Blair a few days later is an effort by Berlin and Paris to reach out to the pro­war camp and seek European unity, though how much common ground the three can find 
on Iraq is unclear. 
Schroeder and Chirac last met two weeks ago and rebuffed a U.S. draft resolution on Iraq, saying it failed to offer a clear perspective for turning over power to a new Iraqi gov­ernment and didn't give the United Nations a strong enough role in postwar Iraq. 
Secretary of State Colin Powell and foreign ministers of the four other veto-wielding Security Council members nwt last weekend in Geneva but failed to bridge gaps on the resolution. 

State Department deputy spokesman Adam Ereli said Tuesday that the weekend meeting between the Europ11an leaders "would also be an opportunity to build on the points of convergence dis­cussed in Geneva and work toward a consen­sus resolution on 
the issue, which

France's ambas­

sador in Washington had suggested in a television interview. 
Blair's spokesman, who briefed reporters in London on condition of anonymity, acknowledged past differences but said the three leaders now want to focus on "how we achieve objectives that we all share -a democratic and eco­nomically prosperous future for the country."

Calif. students react to election recall delay 
By JANINE PLISKA & ANA MILEVA The Berkeley Daily Californian 
BEHKELEY, Calif.-University of California-Berkeley students and other California residents will have to wait for the guberna­torial recall election after a San Francisco federal appeals court on Monday pushed back the Oct. 7 election. ruling that an outdat­l'd voting system could prevent sonH~ votns from being counted. 
After months of fierce cam­paigning in the state's first recall, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled it was unaccept­able that six of California's most populous counties would still count votes using error-prone punch-card machines similar to ones that caused the Florida debacle of the ;woo presidential e I c c t i o n 
Mon~ votes have historically been thrown out under the punch-card system, causing dis­proportionate weighting to votes from counties using other ballot systems, according to the AnH·rican Civil Liberties Union, which filed the appeal. The court agn•ed. 
"The inherent defects in the systnm are such that approxi­matPly 40,000 voters who travel to the polls and cast their ballot will not have their votes counted at all." the judges wrote in their ruling. 
The six counties still using punch-card machines arc Los i\n,Lwles, San Diego, Mendocino, Sarramento, Santa Clara and Solano, making up 44 percent of tlw California voting population. Tlwso are also counties more likely to have significant minority populations. 
All other counties have already switched to computerized voting systems. a conversion mandated in state law to be completed by 2004. 
Hecall proponents immediately denounced the decision. vowing to appeal the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. The appeal must be completed within seven days. 
Opponents of the decision pointed out that the left-leaning Ninth Circuit is one of the most controversial courts in the nation. 
"We will intervene because we're concerned that the people who signed the recall petition want their voices heard," said Ted Costa, one of the leading fig­ures behind the recall. "We're going to the Supreme Court, maybe Tuesday." 
However, foes of the recall effort welcomed the ruling. 
"This decision is about count­ing all the votes," said UC­Berkeley political science profes­sor I lenry Brady. 
The stalled recall election also postpones a vote on two ballot initiatives. 
Although no date has been set for the recall. a likely choice is during the March 2004 presiden­tial primary. 
All of the major gubernatorial candidates continued campaign­ing yesterday. 
"One million six hundred thou­sand Californians of all political persuasions have signed peti­tions to recall Governor Gray Davis," said Arnold Schwarzenegger, the leading Hepuhlican candidate in a state­ment.

The Buston University Daily Free Press 
BOSTON -The Archdiocese of Boston must continue to counsel andcomfon the 552 alleged sexual abuse victims, despite settling with thevictims for $85 million last week, Boston University groups and national Homan Catholic organ­izations said Monday. 
"Certainly for the victims it will mean a lot, but I think nobody believes that a financial settlement is going to solve all the problems," said School of Management Professor James Post. Post is the president and co-founder of Voice of the Faithful, a Boston-based national lay organization founded last year in response to the Catholic Church sexual abuse crisis. 
Post saict the settlement "removed an important boul­der" preventing the archdio­cese from "acknowledging the legitimacy of these claims [of sexual abuse]," and it opens the way to a long-term healing process by facilitating dialogue, accepting responsibility and being honest. 
"Trust in the bishops was absolutely shattered, and that won't come back overnight­and shame on us if it does. But it's clear t~at we have a lot of things to talk thrvugh," he said. "Until now, it's been almost an unbroken record of conflict and anger over the way bishops and the archdiocese have handled these cases. The healing that has to go on is going to take rnany months and probably years of conversation, discus­sion and rebuilding trust.." 
The settlement will become

final if 80 percent of the plain­tiffs accept the offer within 37 days, according to The Boston Globe. 
Senior Michael Braude echoed Post's comments and said although he felt the church made the best decision and hoped the settlement would bring closure, it is only the first of many steps. 
"More important is the church's response to the indi­viduals involved and trying to heal whatever wounds are left," Braude said. "I think that's what [the victims] are looking for -a more responsi­ble church, not a sum of money." 
The hotly discussed "next steps" are counsel and prayer for the victims, according to Karen Mulholland, a BU chap­lain and campus minister at the catholic center. 
"They need a lot of prayer and trust in God because these people need to heal, and God is the healer of all things," Mulholland said. 
"These need to be in the plan so that [the church] is not going start something and then not finish it. They need to stay with the victims as they hea!." 
Mulholland also said the set­tlement "shows the Homan Catholic Church's commitment and sincerity" to bringing clo­sure to those affected. 
Others said the settlement is only a beginning, and certainly not closure, to the cases of cler­gy sex abuse. 
"I don't see this settlement as an 'end' by any means for the victims, parishioners or the clergy," said Harvard University junior Caitlin Swanson, presi­dent of the Harvard-Radcliffe Student Catholic Association. "It simply can't be as clean-cut as that. The only way to work through this situation is a long road of healing with much communication between all members of the archdiocese, be they clergy or lay persons." 
For many the key figure to this recovery is Archbishop Sean O'Malley, who delivered the archdiocese's final offer last week. 
"His job is to repair, and I think he's already demonstrat­ed that he brings great sinceri­ty and lots of skill to this," Post said. "Very few bishops arc really good at reaching out to survivors of abuse, and Bishop O'Malley has done that in a way that no other bishop that I'm aware of, [a way) that real­ly connected with survivors. That's not been true with other · places and other people." 

Mulholland agreed, and said she was "especially grateful" for O'Malley's "active and per­sonal'' involvement. She declined to comment about whether she thought the settle­ment would put the scandal to rest. 
Other victims include the everyday parishioners who have lost or questioned their faith in the church and archdio­cese as a result of the past year, Post and Swanson said. 
"That's where the long-term healing really comes in," Post said. "It's not going to be cured overnight, but these arc people who really do a lot of good work in the church, and they've taken a real blow in learning · what they have." 
Swanson said her position has put her in touch with many students who struggle with their identities as Catholics in Boston during this crisis. stu­dents "who arc sad at the cur­rent state of affairs, empathetic towards the victims and hope­ful for a better future for the Boston archdiocese." 
Students at Boston University, such as graduate student David Gold, said he believes the arch­diocese did the right thing and feels all parties need to "move on" from the tragedy. 
However medical school stu­dent Mura Assifi said accepting the settlement would add to the pattern of secrecy that has defined the sexual abuse scan­dal. 
''I'm glad that the victims are at least being acknowledged, but at the same time it's coming from an institution with so much power that obviously does not want these stories or accounts of what happened to come out in court," Assifi said. 
"Obviously not everyone is guilty, but some kind of justice has to be delivered," she said.

QUOTE OF THE DAY 
"The great thought, the great concern, the great anxiety ofmen is to restrict, as much as possible, the limits oftheir own responsibility." 
Borsi Gidsue writer 
"I expect a great reward in heaven," said Paul I Iill before his execution for the mur­ders of abortionist John Britton and his escort. James Barrett. None of us are the Deputy God Almighty, therefore we cannot judge Hill's entitle­ment to such a Charles Rice reward. But he did give us a wake-up call. 
Hill, Britton and Right or Barrett were all vic­Wrong? tims of a utilitarian culture in which the intentional infliction of death is an optional problem-solving technique. Since Roe v. Wade in 1973, more than 40 million unborn children have been legally execut­ed by surgical abortion, in addition to uncountable millions killed by abortifacient pills and devices, including many "contra­ceptives." The direct and intentional killing of a human being of any age, without justi­fication, is, in moral terms, murder. At the 1994 National Prayer Breakfast, Mother Teresa, describing abortion as "murder," asked, "If we accept that a mother can kill even her own child, how can we tell other people not to kill one another?" 
Contrary to his opinion, Hill's act was not legally and morally unjustified. One has a legal right to use reasonable force, includ­ing lethal force if necessary. to defend his life or that of another. Courts deny this necessity defense to those who block abor­tuaries to stop the killing of tmborn "non­persons." When his trial judge refused to allow Hill to raise the necessity defense, Hill offered no further defense. Hill shot Britton in the parking lot. Even if the necessity defense applied, it would not legalize Hill's act since he was not defend­ing the unborn child from actual or suffi­ciently imminent attack. 
In moral terms, the only situations in which anyone ever has the right intention­ally to kill anyone are the just war and capital punishment. Both are by the In our relativist, individualist culture, we authority of the state which derives its assume the power to decide whether. authority from God who is the Lord of life. when and how life will begin and end, as in In a justified rebellion, private persons contraception, abortion. euthanasia by rightly assume the "just war" authority of sedation or by withdrawal of food and 

the state. We are clearly not in a condition water, assisted suicide, stem-cell research, of rebellion that could justify Hill's killing etc. In his private judgment usurping the 
moral (but not legal) right and per­haps a moral duty, to stop him by force, although it is inconceivable that lethal force could have been necessary. Hill's intent would have had to have been to stop Britton rather than to injure or kill him. 
In the parking lot, Hill killed Britton, not as he was killing an unborn child, but to prevent him from doing so later. Hill was not defending the unborn child from an actual or imminent attack. If Hill could morally kill Britton in the parking lot, why could he not kill him in the supermarket? Or in medical school? 
As a private execution, Hill's act was intrinsically evil. No private person ever has the right intentionally to kill anyone. "A man who, without exercising public authority, kills an evildoer," said Thomas Aquinas, is "guilty of murder, and all the more, since he has dared to usurp a power which God has not given him." ..... 
I!ill sent a false but important message. 
Paul Hill and his followers ever did. 
Legalized abortion will be overcome only through a reconversion of the American people to the conviction that the right to life is sacred because each human being is created in the image and likeness of God with an eternal destiny that transcends the state. Help to women in problem pregnan­cies and political activity arc needed. But the most important step toward that reconversion is prayer, especially the rosary since Mary is the mother of life. Pray for Paul Hill, lor his victims and for all those involved in the killing of unborn chil­dren, especially their mothers.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Proinote fair trade 

It is a natural though unwholc~some tendency to genoralize or categorize a race, Plhnicity. country or continent by the actions of a subset of the whole. Hyan Brady, in his Sept. I(, letter. is quite right by his assertion that some of the problems faced by Third World countries are by and large due to their leaders. The author gives an example of Somalia as one country whose leadership refused American and 

U.N. JJH'dical and food aid. llowevcr we are not told what reasons were given for llw rPI'usal. given tho staggering numbers of poverty-stricken people. I low then can orw make~ an informed judgment about the propriety of Somalia's actions? In addition, are we to assume from the author that most Third World countries have sonwtime in the past looked an American girt. horse in the mouth? Till informed otlwrwisP. I humbly give a rosounding no. Many countries in Africa. Asia and South America am grateful recipients of not only govermental aid but also individ­ual contributions from people like you and me. 
Tlw issues raised in BJ Strew's Sept. 16 column about the World Trade Organization are valid. The advanced countries tell poor countries: liberalize. eliminate all subsidies. launch a free market based economy and when you have dorw all that. then we shall help you. It seems though. that every country needs some form of protectionist legislation. I low else do we explain the fact that the l~uropPan Union and America accuse each other of not doing enough to help Third World countries. although they possess the knowledge that one seemingly insur­mountable obstacle is the agricultural subsidies given to their local industries. 
Again we may look to the Amtrak example. llere is a company that has never turned a profit-and may never in its present form. Yet every year, with a lot of grumbling. more tax-payer funds arc poured into it. Clearly there may exist some soda! benclil'i which transcend purely economic considerations. The purpose of this illustration is not to criticize but to shed some light into similar difficulties also fae~~d by poorer countries in implementing the privatization blueprints assiduously pronwtod by the Group of Eight. the International Moneary Fund and the World Bank. 
Tho debt profile of Third World countries may be likened to the burden of the lsranlites of old in Egypt. To put a modern face to this ancient comparison. permit mP to use the credit card snare. Many people have found out how easy it is to swipn a piece of plastic but how hard it is to pay up a credit card debt when your intl~rost rate is above, say. 15 percent. Then consider a country using 20 -30 per­cent of il'i Gross Domestic Product to service its external debt. This is tho case in tho Third World. 
Starting this Sunday. the Institute of Church and Ufe would hold a conference entitled "A Call to Solidarity with Africa." I would encourage the Notre Dame com­munity to attend. For those who have been priviledged to learn about Africa only through the electronic media. this be may be a unique opportunity to gain a differ­ent, more human. perspective. 
The failure of the wro trade talks in Cancun is an indictment of trade policies everywhere. There is no need to personalize disputes as an attack on any one country. Almost every country has some form of protectionist law. The first step to an amicable global trade policy is the admission that protectionist clauses are harmful to someone else. As an African saying goes. "one man's soup is another man's poison." 
For global economic enfranchisement. as espoused by the multilateral financial institutions. to really take hold, the gospel of "quid pro quo" must be enshrined in the economic policies of all countries.

In a related news item, President George Bush's worst nightmare has just come true. Barring a political nosedive never seen before in the history of this country. Bush would have probably cruised to re-election for one simple rea­son: Americans do not trust Democrats with foreign policy and who can blame them? From Jimmy Carter's debacle in Iran to Bill Clinton's numerous foreign policy failures, most notably Somalia and Rwanda, the Democrats do not exactly inspire confidence from the American people. 
In addition to the FBI and the CIA falling into organizational disarray under Clinton's watch, Clinton downsized the military while refusing to raise their paltry While his name will certainly grab tho headlines. Clark is already at a decided disadvantage from a fundraising stand­point because he has entered the raco so late. But since Clark is truly a different kind of Democrat, the biggest test for tho general will be whether he can demon­strate any political acumen outside the arena of foreign affairs and national security. Simply put, he must connect with voters on social, economic. and domestic issues. If he can. than his dem­ocratic opponents should give up now and throw their support behind him immediately. Otherwise the party faces another loss in 2004. 
From the always entertaining AI Sharpton to the always complaining Dick Gephardt. Democratic voters certainly had a diverse field to choose from prior to yesterday. Yet there was one unmis­takable political reality common amongst all of them. None of them-Sharpton. Gcphardt, John Edwards, Howard Dean, John Kerry, Joe Lieberman. Dennis Kucinich.

But in a time when our nation continues to confront evil Islamic fundamentalist terrorists all over the globe, national security will be the most important issue in the 2004 election.

the 2000 election demonstrated, once

Dean has emerged as an early front runner for the 2004 Democratic nomina­tion, but he might just be his own worst enemy. As some of his Democratic chal­lengers have accurately accused him of this week, he also tends to frequently shoot off his mouth. saying whatever comes to his mind without realizing that his statements arc patently unfounded and factually incorrect. There's a term for this kind of blatant misleading and exaggeration. Oh yes, I remember now. It's called lying! Of course. lying and pol­itics go together like peanut butter and jelly so this might not be as alarming as it seems. 
According to early polls, Dean's most formidable challenger thus far has been Kerry. On the surface, Kerry seems like a very viable candidate. Based on his vot­ing record, he is for all intensive purpos­es a moderate Democrat. For example. Kerry made headlines when he broke from party ranks and voiced his support for school vouchers. Perhaps most appealing of all, he served two tours of duty in Vietnam, so his commitment to his country is indisputable. 
All of this aside, Kerry's campaign has stumbled out of the gate because he has yet to reveal how he will be any different from the current administration. Massachusetts's other senator, Chuck Schumer, loves to criticize and attack Bush from almost every conceivable angle. but when you fail to offer any alternative solutions, you become just another political windbag and people grow tired of listening to you real fast. Up to this point. Kerry has been long on potential. short on policy. 
With such weak candidates to choose from. registered Democrats were faced with choosing the least evil of many evils for their nomination something that may change with General Wesley Clark enter­ing the race.

Remembering the Man in Black 
By LIAM FARRELL 
Scene Writer 
Johnny Cash, the country music icon known as "The Man in Black," died Friday of a complication from diabetes at the age of 71. He had been in poor health for several years, and despite maintaining both vigor and musical vitality throughout his old age the past year had dealt him heavy blows with his own continuing health difficulties as well as the death of his beloved wife, June. 
Cash was a legend long before his recent death, a genre crossing force of songwriting talent and distinctive per­formance. He defined "cool" for genera­tions and well into his old age, while per­sonifying an outlaw who once, in the words of his famous song "Folsom Prison Blues," "shot a man in Heno just to watch him die." That song, along with other notables such as "Bing of Fire," "A Boy Named Sue" (featuring lyrics by She! Silverstein) and the gorgeous "I Still Miss Someone" form only a portion of the five decade career that made Cash into a cul­tural force. 

Raised in Arkansas~ Cash wandered from job to job and spent time in the mili­tary until he became part of the leg­endary Sun Studio recording lineup dur­ing the mid-and late 1950s. Cash was recruited and mentored by the late Sam Phillips, who was also responsible for the start of Elvis Presley's career. Cash's out­put with Sun was diverse in content, spirit and genre, blending country, rockabilly, gospel and eventually rock and roll into a potent combination that continued to serve Cash long after he had left Sun and began recording with Columbia Records. 
A wild man who occasionally held con­certs in prisons (much to the delight of the prisoners). Cash was in many ways sated and saved by his love affair and eventual marriage to June Carter, a mem­ber of the famous country music Carter family. Carter and Cash met and fell in 
love while on tour together. and they 
were inseparable after their marriage in 
1968 until her death last May. 
Through the decades, career and label 
changes, one thing never changed, and that was the unquestionable and enor­mous influence that Cash was able to maintain on popular music. Unlike Elvis, he survived his indulgences and failed to become either a self parody or a punch line, keeping his dignity at all times. As he aged, Cash did not shun recent pop music trends like many country singers do; instead, he delved into the modern mate­rial on his American Recordings albums in the 1990s, and he provided relevant musicians such as U2 continued inspira­tion. 

Perhaps the most stunning artistic statement Cash ever made, however, was his last. At this year's MTV Video Music Awards, Cash's video "Hurt," a cover of a Nine Inch Nails song, was nominated for five awards and won for best cinematog­raphy. The very fact that a 71-year-old country singer found his way into the youth-centered and self-conscious MTV environment alone shows how significant this video was; it is truly breathtaking. The video juxtaposes images of Cash in his youth with his elderly self, in an empty house filled with rotting food on a banquet table, near the shutdown and decrepit House of Cash Museum. It is a frightening display of the physical and emotional decay of an artist who was burdened and overwhelmed by age and time, but it remains a fitting and passion­ate eulogy for such an artist. 
Johnny Cash reached and influenced more artists and people than can be named here. He was a charismatic song­writer and performer who, well into his old age, showed how music is not only for

It lost a legacy ­a tower of integrity and artistic achieve­ment in a bankrupt pop music world that Cash spoke out against in his signature song: "well we're doing mighty fine I do suppose/ in our streak of lightnin · cars and fancy clothes I but just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back I up front there ought 'a be a Man in Black."

ALBUM REVIEW 
Dashboard Confessional search for an identity 
By LIAM FARRELL 
Scene Music Critic 
Listening to a Dashboard Confessional CD is like reading somebody's high school diary -you feel a little guilty, yet you can't really put it down and for some rea­son you keep coming back for more. 
Lead singer Chris Carraba and compa­ny are on their way to becoming America's favorite guilty pleasure on their third full-length album, A Mark, a Mission. a Brand, a Scar. 
Carraba, who once was a solo act under the band's name, has enlisted the help of permanent musicians. Although many fans have found this distracting and destructive to the solo heartbreak that was peddled on his first album Swiss Army Romance, production and instru­mentation have become increasingly important on later EPs and albums. The 
AMark, aMission, aBrand, aScar Dashboard Confessional 
Vagrant Records 

label "sell-out" is sure to follow him around for awhile, but if nothing else his latest effort is marked by a musical matu­rity that has been absent on earlier work. The guitar, drums and bass all flow and balance much easier, and a more con­crete and resilient sound is produced. 
Granted, there was something endear­ing when Carraba and Dashboard were a single entity. Every song seemed to be written and recorded by a high school kid in his bedroom after getting rejected by a girl he wanted to go to prom with; you could practically hear his mother calling him down for dinner. It was stuff any high school outcast could relate to, and judging by the fanaticism of his fans, feel a part of. 
But music careers are in essence about maturation and acceleration. Many of the best songs on A Mark would not fit on earlier works. The organ and loping tempo of the strongest track. "Carve Your Heart Out Yourself," would have felt bizarre on earlier efforts, as would the haunting and tragic "Ghost of a Good Thing". Carraba seems to be reach­ing for more intri­cate melodies and different avenues to express himself; his chaotic guitar style is still evident, but there is something about it that makes it more background and less noise. 

Dashboard fans can take heart, though, that not much has changed with the lyrics. Emo's answer to Morrissey comes through with more tragedy and broken hearts than a John Hughes' film, with "Rapid Hope Loss" being the best song about a failed relationship. Occasionally happy moments have the spotlight, like the remade "Hands Down," which pro­vides lift and spark to the album's begin­ning. 
It will be interesting to see where Dashboard Confessional takes itself after this effort. Their last album, The Places You Have Come To Fear The Most, was better and seemed stronger, perhaps, because it was not caught between past success and the bright future ahead. It is a good album, but ambiguous, because at this point they are still trying to get a handle on an audience. 
The last song, "Several Ways To· Die Trying," is either a message to an old lover or their fans. The speaker and his band mates shout and scream, "take notice, take interest, take· me with you I but all our fears fall on deaf cars." Hopefully, Dashboard Confessional will stop listening to their fans and listen to their inner muse, learning lessons from the last stanza of the same song: "tonight, they're burning the roads they built to lead us to the light I and blinding our hearts with their shining lies I while clos­ing our caskets cold and tight. But I'm dying to live."

ALBUM REVIEW 
Alien Ant Farm explore new terrain 
By BRIAN FOY Scenr Music Critic 
It's been two years since Alien Ant Farm broke through with their cover of Miehael Jackson's "Smooth Criminal." and since then the boys have been to hell and back again. After spending the majority of last year rocov1~ring from a near-fatal bus accident. /\lion Ant Farm is back with a 1ww album and a seemingly new outlook on life. The band has enlisted the help of the DeLeo brothers of Stone Tmnple Pilots fame to produce thoir follow-up to the multi-platinum ;\N7'hology, resulting in a more exper­imontal and boundary-breaking sound that leavos no musical stone unturned. 
It is ·quite evident from the opening strains of the first track of truANT that Alien Ant Farm has matured musically, but this surface listen gives no indication of their progression lyri­cally. In the chorus of "Sarah Wynn," a childhood friend's demise is revisit­ed: "Why the hell were you shooting up? I Now you're coming down, Sarah!" 
"Tia Lupc" is a song about a lover that opens with the lines "She traps a velvet moth between her harmless hands I Then builds an atrium to perch on her nightstand." Lyrically, Alien Ant Farm is clearly a new and improved version of their MTV buzz­worthy selves. 
The band docs a truly fantastic job of representing several styles of music 


ALBUM REVIEW 
New Vertical Horizon release largely forgettable 
By EMILY TUM BRINK 
Assisr.mr Scene F.diror 
Nearly thnw years after their multi­platinum major label debut Everything You Want. the guys from Vertical Ilorizon have finally decided to release anotlwr album. 
Due out on Sept. 23, Go, the band's sophomore attempt, shows that little has changed during that time. In the intervinw included in their press pack, l1~ad singer Matt Scannell suggests that VPrtical Horizon has matured as a band over tlw past few years. 
"With our last album. we still had some unanswered questions about what kind of band we wanted to be," Scannnll said. "We knew we were on a 
journey and wanted to keep develop­ing. With this album, we're more cer­tain than ever of our direction and identity." But, after listening to their new album, the growth that Scannell hints at is seemingly nowhere to be found. That's not to say that Vertical Horizon has released a terrible album; they simply remain the same deriva­tive band found on b'verything You Want, purloining elements from other bands' music to create a sound that is largely forgettable. 
Unfortunately for listeners, Go mir­rors the same !lawed approach that is found on Everything You Want. Once again, the band creates catchy and radio-friendly songs in the lukewarm rock or alterna-pop vein. Heminiscent of bands that were popular in the late

on songs like "1,000 Days," but the band also progresses way beyond that through­out this album. On "Glow," Alien Ant Farm utilizes acoustic guitars, percussion and the occasional handclap. "Tia Lupc" has a fast paced salsa vibe that utilizes both a piano and a trum­pet. However, the crowning achievement of truANT must be "llope," complete with its violins and cello. 
Alien Ant Farm owes some of the credit of the distinct truANT sound to the DeLeo brothers. Their influence is quite apparent on several of the tracks; they appear to be taken straight from a Stone Temple Pilots record. Songs like "Hubber Mallet" and" "Drifting

While Vertical Horizon has success­fully created a largely forgettable bunch of tracks. nothing about Go is bad or offensive beyond this fact. ­Those who enjoyed the singles from their previous_release, "You're a God." "Everything You Want" and "Gray Sky Morning," will probably appreciate most of the tracks on the album. Most listeners, however, will be better off waiting for the singles from the album to be played to death on the radio, making the purchase of Go completely unnecessary. Either way, the songs on Go must be relegated to serving only as background music, as the tracks themselves are not interesting or excit­ing enough to merit a focused listen.

With roots as a two-person acoustic folk band formed during their under­graduate years at Georgetown, many longtime fans complained that Vertical Horizon had sold out with their largely electric debut release. The band's first two independently released albums possessed a far dif­ferent sound than the one present on either of Vertical Horizon's RCA releases. The addition of two new members and a few more instruments has completely changed the style and genre of their music. Shifting to a much more streamlined and main­stream sound on their major label debut, Vertical Horizon gained numer­ous new listeners while exploiting their original fan base. The same can

Phillies win as Lieberthal drives in six 
Associated Press 

PHILADELPHIA -Mike Lieberthal hit a grand slam and drove in six runs, and Vicente Padilla pitched eight shutout innings as the Philadelphia Phillies routed the Florida Marlins 14-0 on Tuesday night. 
The Phillies closed within a half-game of the NL wild card­leading Marlins, who had won eight straight against Philadelphia. The teams play twice more at Veterans Stadium and three games in Florida next week. 
Padilla (14-1 0) allowed five hits and retired 15 of the last 17 he faced. He struck out six and had no walks. Carlos Silva pitched the ninth to complete the five-hitter. 
Lieberthal's two-run single sparked a four-run first, and Jim Thome hit his 41st homer -a two-run shot to right-cen­ter in the sixth that earned him a curtain call from the crowd of 36,479. Jimmy Rollins had three hits and two RBis, and Marlon Byrd had three hits and scored three times. 
Lieberthal's third career grand slam highlighted a seven-run eighth. 
Carl Pavano (11-12) gave up six runs and nine hits in 5 1-3 innings, losing for just the sec­ond time since July 9. The 

right-hander was  5-l in his  
previous 10 starts.  
Cubs 3, Mets 2  .  

Sammy Sosa homered for the first time in more than a week, and Mark Prior struck out 13 in 8 2-3 innings as the Chicago Cubs beat the New York Mets 3-2 Tuesday on a historic night at Wrigley Field. 
Sosa drove in all of Chicago's runs, including a two-run homer in the third inning that put the Cubs ahead. Prior took care of the Mets from there, reaching double-digits in strikeouts for the sixth time this season as he improved to 8-1 since returning from the disabled list Aug. 4. 
Prior was one out from his fourth complete game this sea­son, but he allowed Matt Watson's RBI double in the ninth that brought the Mets within 3-2. Joe Borowski walked Raul Gonzalez to put runners on first and second but then struck out Hoger Cedeno for his 30th save in 34 chances. 
And a record crowd was on hand to see it. With a crowd of 39,534 the Cubs set a new sin­gle-season attendance record at Wrigley Field. 
Expos 5, Braves 4 
Greg Maddux was denied his 15th win when Atlanta's bullpen failed to hold a three­run lead, and the Montreal Expos beat the Braves 5-4 Tuesday night on Orlando Cabrera's run-scoring double in the lOth inning. 
Maddux, trying to become the first pitcher to win 15 or more games in 16 consecutive seasons, allowed one run and four hits in seven innings, including three doubles. Maddux, making his second attempt to win No. 15, is tied with Cy Young at 15 straight 15-win seasons. 
Javy Lopez caught Maddux in a regular-season game for the first time since Sept. 8. 1998. 
Despite the loss, Atlanta low­ered the magic number to two for clinching its 12th consecu­tive division title. Second-place Florida lost 14-0 at Philadelphia. 
Atlanta led 4-1 before Vladimir Guererro's RBI single in the eighth off Jaret Wright. 
Reds 12, Pirates 4 
Ryan Freel had a career-high four hits, including a homer, to lead a 17-hit attack as the Cincinnati Reds beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 12-4 on Tuesday night. 


Freel, 4-for-5 with three RBls, returned to the lineup after missing 12 games with a strained right hamstring. 
D'Angelo Jimenez added three hits and drove in three runs, and Wily Mo Pena home­red for Cincinnati, which had lost five of its previous six road games. 
Aaron Harang (4-2), who 
hadn't pitched since straining his lower back Sept. 5, scat­tered four hits over five innings. Brian Reith earned his first career save with 2 1-3 scoreless innings. 
Pittsburgh starter Oliver Perez (4-9). who pitched six scoreless innings against the Reds in his last outing Sept. 10, allowed eight hits and four runs in five innings. 
The Reds led 5-4 before breaking it open with four 
runs in the eighth off reliever Mark Corey. 
Jason LaRue, doubled and scored on Ruben Mateo's sin­gle. Ray Olmedo grounded into fielder's choice, Dernell Stenson walked on four pitches and Freel was hit by a pitch to load the bases. 
Tim Hummel hit a sacrifice fly to make it 7-4. Jimenez hit a two-run single to make it 9-4. 
Stenson had a sacrifice fly and Freel hit a two-run single.

NFL 
Rhodes turning around Seattle D 
Associated Press 
KIRKLAND, Wash. -The best defensive addition for the Seattle Seahawks is a guy who spends Sundays in the booth. 
New defensive coordinator Ray Rhodes is making an impact in Seattle, working with old pal Mike Holmgren again. After only two games, this defense is more aggressive, more physical and more effective than last season. 
"We can be a great defense," said linebacker Randall Godfrey, who joined the Seahawks after being released by Tennessee in a salary-cap move. "We just need to keep guys mentally pre­pared and continue to hustle." 
They look great so far, although the opposition last week was Arizona, one of the worst NFL teams of the last decade. 
The Seahawks have forced 10 turnovers in two wins -six in Sunday's 38-0 victory against the Cardinals. More than the statistics, though, arc the trade­mark Rhodes-style hard hits and enthusiasm. 
"Everyone believes in it. Everyone is doing what Hay is asking," defensive end Anton Palepoi said. "He's Jetting ath­letes be athletes, letting people play their game, just cutting us loose." 
Changes were needed after last season, when the Seahawks finished 7-9 with the NFL's worst run defense. Seattle allowed 152.6 yards rushing a game in 2002 and ranked 28th overall, giving up 365.8 total yards. 
Holmgren fired coordinator Steve Sidwell and the defensive staff, all of them his old friends. One month later llolrngren hired Rhodes, who helped him forge a winner in Green Bay in the 1990s and went on to head coaching jobs with the Eagles and Packers. 
He's known as a turnaround specialist. 
Three years ago, he took a Washington defense that ranked 30th in yards allowed during the 1999 season and boosted it to fourth. Rhodes spent the next two years in Denver, moving the Broncos from 24th to eighth in one season and sixth the next. 
"I've \".'orked with him before, and so I know what he brings to the table," Holmgren said. "But in fairness to the people who were here before, we have dif­ferent players on the field. They seem to be mixing very, very well." 
Godfrey took over as the start­ing middle linebacker and the Seahawks landed pass-rushing end Chike Okeafor and run­stopping tackle Norman lland. They drafted two solid rookies in cornerback Marcus Trufant and free safety Ken Hamlin. 
Veterans Chad Brown and Anthony Simmons at linebacker and lineman John Handle all missed several games last soa­son, but they're healthy now. 
"We didn't have them last year, so the combination seems to be working pretty well," Holmgren said Monday. "Yesterday we played everybody on defense. You definitely feel good about that. Everyone con­tributed." 
Holmes questionable for game at Houston 
Associated Press 
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -Priest Holmes is questionable for Sunday's game at Houston with bruised ribs. raising anew the question of whether Kansas City is asking too much of its Pro Bowl running back. 
Holmes, the NFL's offensive player of the year in 2002, missed the final two games last season with a hip injury that required surgery in March and had him on crutches for several weeks. 
The Chiefs have said they wanted Holmes to get fewer touches than last season, when he had 313 carries for 1,615 yards and 70 passes for another 672 in just 14 games. 
But in victories over San Diego and Pittsburgh, Holmes has 53 touches. more than anyone else in the NFL except Miami's Hicky Williams -a lot of punishment for a running back who will turn 30 in a few weeks. 
While nobody is saying Holmes' bruised ribs won't be healed by Sunday, head coach Dick Vermeil said Tuesday that rookie Larry Johnson could be activated this week for the first time. 
Chiefs coaches are sensitive to suggestions that they might be 
subjecting their top player to  
more injury by overuse.  
"Last year at this time, Priest  
had 44 carries for 206 yards and  
four touchdowns," offensive  
coordinator AI Saunders said.  
'This year he's had 44 carries  
for 207 yards and five touch­ 
downs. Last year after two  
games he had 11 catches for 50­ 
some yards. This year he's had  
nine catches for 104-some yards.  - 
His workload is exactly the same  
after the first two games as it  
was last year."  
Nevertheless, some critics are  
asking why a valuable player  
~bmin'g off hll}' surgery was still  
playing against the hard-tackling  
Steelers with a 34-20 lead and  
about five minutes to go. "As soon as you start taking  - 
people out of the game, you send  
a message to the rest of the team  
that you think it's over," Vermeil  
said.  
One of the scariest moments  
last week came on Holmes' sec­ 
ond TO, when he vaulted across  
the goal line and landed, with all  
his 213 pounds, squarely on that  
surgically repaired hip.  
He got up and went to the side­ 
line and was re-taped.  
''I've got to learn how to land  
on my feet because I want to be  
there for the next play," he said  
with a grin.

Attention flatters and frustrates Witlslol'V 
Krenzel 
•
nurs:mg ariTI :tn)ury 
Associated Press 
COLUMBUS, Ohio -Ohio State starting quarterback Craig Krenzel might miss Saturday's game against Bowling Green because of an elbow injury. 
Krenzel hurt ligaments in his throwing arm when he was hit while throwing a pass in Saturday's 44-38 triple-over­time win over North C:arolina State. 
Tests on Tuesday disclosed that Krenzel had a strained ulnar collateral ligament and a sprained flexor tendon in his right arm. A somber Krenzel said that he has been advised not to throw a football for fear of making the injury worse. 
Asked whether he would be able to play if his condition did­n't improve, Kr"enzel said. "Probably not." 
"If pitchers and quarterbacks tear that ligament, it's some­thing that possibly can be career-threatening," Krenzel said. "For one week, if it does­n't get any better and it's still sore and bothersome then the doctors and the trainers are going to be the ones making the decision, not me." 
Krenzel supplied most of Ohio State's offense in the victory over North Carolina State. He led the Buckeyes in rushing with 13 carries for 37 yards ­no other back netted more than 5 yards-and completed 26 of 36 passes for 273 yards. His four touchdown passes were a career high, as were hi~> three interceptions. 
"He got banged real good in the second quarter, and it was bothering him a little bit," coach Jim Tressel said. "Like many of the guys, the adrena­line is going, he's a competitor. And, yeah, it was hurting a lit­tle bit, but so what? And all of a sudden on Sunday, you know, it's a little bit tighter, and Monday, you know, it's tight." 
Senior backup Scott McMullen took most of the snaps at practice Tuesday, with redshirt freshmen Justin Zwick and Troy Smith sharing duty behind him. 
"Right now I'm just taking it 
as if I'm starting," McMullen 
said. "I know it's a day-to-day 
thing. But I've got to treat it 
like I've got to play on 
Saturday." 
The senior quarterback is 18­
1 as a starter. 
Krenzel's favorite target, 
wide receiver Micna.eLJ,tmhl,ns. 
said the odds are in favor of 
Krenzel being ready to play. 
"It's going to take a lot to 
keep Craig out of there," 
Jenkins said. "But if he can't go 
and the doctors say he nr,eds to 
sit out, he's going to do what's 
best. It's going to eat him up 
inside. If he can't go, Scott 
McMullen is a capable backup 
and I'm sure he'll step up and 
do a good job." 
Tressel said the emotion of 
the moment was enough to 
keep Krenzel in the game. After 
North Carolina State came back 
from a 24-7 deficit to send the 
game into overtime, Krenzel 
was at his best. 
Associated Press 
CORAL GABLES, Fla. ­Miami tight end Kellen Winslow is getting chipped, jammed and double-covered. The attention is flattering and frustrating. 
Winslow has 11 catches for 97 yards and one touchdown in three games, numbers well below what he expected in his junior season. 
He dubbed himself "The 

Chosen One" this summer, then struck a Heisman Trophy p0se after his lone touchdown in the Clpener at Louisiana Tech. But the ultra-confident son of an NFL Hall of Farner hasn't had much to celebrate since. 
His angst reached a new low Saturday night after catching just two passes for 27 yards against winless East Carolina. 
"It's been vuy frustrating," he said. "They doc:ble me, they're zoning me. That's when other people come up with the big plays."' 
Winslow points to the con­stant attention he receives when he steps on the field. lie often gets hit by defensive line­men, pressed by linebackers and closely watched by safeties. 
Winslow caught 57 passes for 726 yards and eight touch­downs last season, breaking school records for tight ends for receptions, yards and touchdowns. 
In the offseason, Winslow added 10 pounds of muscle to his 6-foot-5 frame, developed more lower body strength to become a better blocker. increased his vertical jump to 37 inches and even took a flex­ibility class that included ballet lessons. 
He also said his goal was to catch 80 passes this season. The hype may have guaran­teed the extra attention. 
''!' m just trying to be patient," Winslow said.

AMERICAN LEAGUE 
Martinez' 6-hitter extends Red Sox vvild-card 111argin 
Associated Press 
BOSTON -Pedro Martinez pitched a six-hitter for his 1OOth win with Boston. and the Red Sox used a two-run eighth inning to beat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 3-2 on Tuesday night. 
Martinez (13-4) had thrown 15 consecutive shutout innings before Tampa Bay tied it 1-1 in the eighth when Julio Lugo walked, moved to second on a groundout and scored on AI Martin's pinch-hit single. 
The Red Sox. who won their third straight, began the day with a 1 1/2-game lead over Seattle in the wild-card race and trailed the New York Yankees by 5 1/2 in the AL East. 
Martinez, in his sixth year with Boston, walked one and struck out six in his second complete game of the season. He allowed fewer than two earned runs for the 14th time in his last 19 starts. The win was his third in 12 days. 
The Hed Sox scored the go­ahead runs in the eighth as Nomar Garciaparra broke out of a 4-for-36 slump with a lead­off double in the eighth off Travis llarper (4-8). He took third on Todd Walker's ground­out before Manny Hamirez was walked intentionally. 
Lefty Joe Kennedy came in to face lefty David Ortiz and threw three straight balls. He came back with two strikes before Ortiz lined a single to right that scored Garciaparra and sent Ramirez to third. 
Adrian Brown ran for Ramirez and scored on Bill Mueller's sacrifice fly. That run became critical when Tampa Bay scored in the ninth on a two-out single by Marlon Anderson. Defensive indiffer­ence sent him to second, and Pete LaForest singled. But Lugo popped to second to end the game. 
Blue Jays 9, Tigers 6 
Frank Catalanotto singled home the go-ahead run in a four-run seventh inning, and the Toronto Blue Jays beat Detroit 9-6 Tuesday night to hand the Tigers their 112th 
loss. 
Detroit (38-112), which has dropped four straight, tied the 1952 Pittsburgh Pirates (42­
112) and 1965 New York Mets (50-112) for the seventh-most losses in a major league season. The Tigers moved within five of the American League record, set by the 1916 Philadelphia Athletics (36-117). 
Detroit needs five or more wins in its last 12 games to avoid the post-1900 major league mark. set by the 1962 Mets. 
Twins 5, White Sox 2 
Esteban Loiaza will have to wait for another chance at 20 wins, and the Minnesota Twins moved a step closer to their sec­ond straight division title. 
Brad Radke beat Loiaza for the second time in six days as the Twins stretched their AL Central lead over the Chicago White Sox to 1 1/2 games with a 5-2 victory Tuesday. 
Torii Hunter and rookie Michael Ryan each had two hits as the Twins took advantage of some uncharacteristic wildness in the shortest start of the sea­son by Chicago's Cy Young can­didate. 
Loiaza (19-8) walked five in 2 1-3 innings. He entered tied for seventh in the league in fewest walks per nine innings (2.0). 
The Twins have been alone in first place for two straight days, the first time that's happened since June 22-23. 
A crowd of 32,921 was given Homer Hankies left over from last year's playoff run, and they made it sound a little like a postseason game as Minnesota led 4-0 after three. 
Manager Jerry Manuel, whose team was idle Monday, flip­flopped Loiaza and Jon Garlan::l in the rotation to set the tone for this crucial series. 
But Loiaza simply flopped. 
Loiaza, who never won more than 11 games in a season dur­ing his eight major league sea­sons, allowed five runs in a 5-2 loss to Radke and the Twins in Chicago last week. 
His night began ominously with a leadoff walk to Shannon Stewart and ended after 2 1-3 innings, four singles, four runs and 7 4 pitches. · 


Loiaza loaded tho bases on walks in the f:rst. escaping with cnly one run when Corey Koskie hit a sacrifice 11y to deep left and Hunter chopped an inning­ending grounder to second. 
Rangers 10, Mariners 5 

Alex Rodriguez hit his major league-leading 44th homer and rookie Layr.ce Nix homered twice to lead the Texas Rangers over the Seattle M1triners 10-5 Tuesday night. 
Hank Blalock had a three-run homer for Texas, which opened a 9-0 lead in the fourth inning and dropped Seattle 2 1/2 games behind Boston in the AL wild-card race. 
The Mariners have lost three straight and are 6-8 in SeptPmber. 
Rodriguez homered in the first inning, his fiftfi homer in his last six games. He had three hits and three RB!s. 
Gil Meche (15-11) allowed eight runs and seven hits ­four of them homers -in 2 1-3 innings. 
John Thomson (13-13) gave up three runs and nine hits in eight innings. 
Nix, Michael Young and Mark Teixeira all had three hits for the Rangers, who had lost nine of their previvus 11. Nix matched his career high with four RB!s. 
Texas broke opt;n the game with a five-run second, when Nix hit a two-run homer and Bialock hit a three-run drive. Nix hit another two-run homer in the third.

In .July. Webber pleaded guilty to a lesser charge or criminal contempt a day lwl'orn jury selection was to begin in his perjury trial. 
W1~bber and his father, Mayce Webber Jr., were accused of lying about money authorities say the player recnived from ex-booster Ed

In his plea, Webber admitted lying to the grand jury on Aug.

Bryant's lavvyers file request for records 
Release ofaccuser's medical records being questioned 
Associated Press 
DENVEH -Kobe Bryant's lawyers have asked for a hear­ing on their request for med­ical records of the woman who accused him of rape, saying the documents would help the judge evaluate her credibility. 
In· a court filing Monday, defense attorney Pamela Mackey said the records should be released before Bryant's Oct. 9 preliminary hearing, when the judge will decide whether the evidence is sufficient to warrant a trial. 
Bryant's lawyers have asked for the woman's records from a clinic in Eagle. a hospital in Greeley and the student health service at the University of Northern Colorado in Greeley. The woman had been treated earlier this year for mental health problems. 
Bryant is charged with rap­ing the Eagle woman June 30 in his suite at a mountain resort where she worked and he was a guest. Bryant has said the two had consensual sex. 
In another court filing, Vail police asked a judge Tuesday to quash a subpoena seeking records including recordings of 911 calls made from the accuser's home. Another judge has already rejected a request for those records by the Vail Daily newspaper, saying release of the "intensely per­sonal'' material would subject the woman to harassment and abuse. 

Attorney Matthew Min•, rPp­resenting the Vail police department, said releasing the 91 I records to Bryant's attor­neys would violatn. that earlier order. 
Proscctrtors ar~~ fighting release of the records, saying the woman hasn't waived her privacy rights except on records from a mmlical exami­nation the day after llw allngpd attack. 
The defense is also trying to force the woman to testify dur­ing the preliminary hearing, and Mackey's filing Monday said the defense wants to have tho medical records in order to ask the woman about them. 
"Because of llw im portancc of the accuser's testimony to a finding of probable cause, the defense should be permitted to test her credibility as fully as possible, even at this prelimi­nary stage," she wrote. 
Prosecutors have asked the judge not to force the accuser to testify at the preliminary hearing. They plan to present a videotaped statement by her. 
Legal experts said the defense request for a hearing on the medical records might be another attempt to put the woman on the stand before a trial. 
Former Denver prosecutor Craig Silverman said the woman might have to testify at such a hearing for a judge to determine whether she waived her right to medical privacy by discussing her medical history with others. 
"They win if they force her to testify because it gives them a pretrial opportunity to see her on the stand," Silverman said.

ATLANTA -AOL Time Warner agreed to sell the Atlanta Hawks and Thrashers for $250 mil­lion to a group that includes the bon-in-law of former owner Ted Turner. 
The 1company is getting rid of the NBA and NHL teams as part of an effort to pay down $24 billion in debt. 
Boston businessman Steve Belkin was intro­duced Tuesday. as the leader of the investor group, 10 month.> after he 

lost a bid for an NBA fran­chise in North Carolina. 
"During 1his year I've gone from an incrediblt low point to an incredible high point," Belkin .said at a news conference. Belkin founded the Trans National Group, a market­ing and investment com­pany. 
Babeball's Atlanta Braves, also owned by AOL Time Warner, are not part of the deal. The com· pany had expressed inter­est in selling the team, but Terry McGuirk, vice chair­
man of subsidiary Turner Broadcastltng, said the company was no longer actively looking for a buyer. 
"As with any public company, anything is for sale," he said. "But I think there is a growing satisfaction with how the Braves are going:" 
Turner owned the three teams before Turner Broadcast,ing merged with Time Warner, which in turn merged with America Online. 
Besides Belkin, the 
investment group includes Turner's son-in­law. lawyer J. Rutherford Seydel; longtime Hawks executive Michael Gearon and his son, Michael Gearon Jr.; Edwin Peskowitz and Bruce Levenson, former minori­ty owners of the NBA's Washington Bullets and the NI-IL's Washington Capitals; Washington businessman Todd

IN BRIEF 
Montreal forward injuredwith accidental high stick 
MONTREAL-Montreal Canadiens forward Chad Kilger was hospitalized Tuesday after sustaining a serious eye injury from an accidental high stick in training camp. 
"It's frightening," team doctor David Mulder said of the injury, multiple fractures around Kilger's left eye sock­et. 
Mulder said there was bleeding in the eye area and that the sinuses were also affected. 
Doctors were waiting for swelling to go down to take further tests. Mulder said it may take a few days to deter­mine the exact extent of the injury. 
The 6-foot-4, 223-pound Kilger, who doesn't wear a visor, was hit by the high stick during practice on Monday morning. 
"We're worried, for sure, and we're thinking about l!is health above all," coach Claude Julien said. "I have confidence in our medical team and I hope everything comes

Forward Benoit Gratton went for an MRI on Tuesday after spraining his left knee. NCAA urges local emphasis on sportsmanship 
INDIANAPOLIS -The NCAA on Tuesday urged coaches and admin­istrators from every college to meet with community and police leaders to develop policies on sportsman­ship and fan behavior. · 
The recommendation was includ­ed in a 17-page report on a sports­manship summit held in Dallas in February involving almost 150 col­lege, community and law enforce­ment officials. 
The report said those involved with college athletics had a respon­sibility to ensure a safe and positive environment. 
"Intercollegiate athletics does not function in a vacuum," the report concluded. "Its qualities, redeeming and harmful, have been developed and shaped over time by the culture of greater society." 
The report outlined a dozen inci­dents following college athletic events since 1999, including rioting at Michigan State, Purdur and Indiana after Final Four losses and at Minnesota each of the past two years after the Gophers won the men's hockey championship. 
The NCAA did not propose any solutions to fan violence but said it would work as "a type of clearing­house" to help colleges and confer­ences come up with their own ideas. 
The NCAA urged each school and conference to look into the problem and to meet before the start of the next academic year to review its sportsmanship policies. 
"Institutions must make careful decisions about whether to try to limit all access to the field or court after games, or to permit fans on the field/court after games but try to limit inappropriate behavior."

FOOTBALL 
ESPN moves 'The Season' 
New slzow time will be 011 Thursdays 
By CHRIS FEDERICO 
Sports Writer 
ESI'N announced Tuesday that "Tiw S1~ason ," the college football n~ality programming sPrii~S focusing on Notrn Dame this season will switch time slots to 11 p.m. South Bend time Thursday from the 7 p.m. Ttwsday slot it occupied for the pn~mif~re episode. 
An ESPN producer said Tuesday the change was made to place the show in a time slot with higlwr ratings potential. "Th1~ Season" will now air fol­lowing 1\SI'N's Thursday night NCAA football game, in a slot the station hopes will be more attractive to college football fans. ESI'N intended to intro­duce the show in prime time the first week and then move it to il'> usual time slot on Thursday nighL'>. 
Last week, ESPN's Thursday night game drew a 2.2 share (the percent of televisions in use that are turwd to a certain pro­gram). attracting more vil~wers than iL'> Saturday night game. 
Third down deficiency 
Irish coaches expressed con­cern Tuesday after practice with Notn~ Dame's efl"ectiveness on third downs on both sides of the ball this season. 
Last week. the Irish converted on only 1-of-12 attempts on third downs. Meanwhile, the Wolverines were 12-for-19 on third down Saturday. 
"My big disappointment was with third down," Irish defen­sive coordinator Kent Baer said. "You had the third down con­versions !Michigan made!. which really technique-wise carne down to tackling.... If we do a good job on third down. we don't play as many snaps. I think it carne down to tackling, which upsets me because we're good tacklers." 
On the season, the Irish have converted on only 5-of-28 third down attempts. Opponents arc 17 -for-35 on third down. 
Making a mark 
Saturday was a day of firsts for true freshman quarterback Brady Quinn, who completed his first NCAA pass in the fourth quarter against Michigan. 
"[The completion] felt good," Quinn said. "It was a chance to get the ball moving and get the chains moving. I was hoping to have a few more of those and get the ball down the field and get some points on the board, but that wasn't the case." 
Quinn, however, also experi­enced his first NCAA intercep­tion as he finished the day 3-of­1 0 passing for 33 yards. 
"It was a bad read, plus the ball kind of slipped out," Quinn said Tuesday of the errant pass. "I think if I would have put the ball on a line, it would have had a chance to get to the receiver. But looking back at it, it proba­bly wasn't the guy I should have gone to." 
0-Line still growing 
After giving up seven sacks and four fumbles by Carlyle lloliday against Washington State in the opener and only 49 rushing yards at Michigan, the offensive line is going through some major growing pains. 
"We are not making any excuses about that. All of the young men that we have, we expect them to step up and play," Notre Dame coach Tyrone Willingham said. "We as coach­es have to do an excellent job of getting everything done right with them. Right now, as an offensive team, we have not executed. We have got to do a better job of execution for us to be successful." 
Other TV news 
ABC Sports announced Tuesday it will televise the Sept. 27 Notre Dame versus Purdue football game on a regional basis. The game will be broad­cast to 37 percent of the nation and will be aired in all of Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, New York, Maine, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont and New Hampshire, plus parts of Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Louisiana and Mississippi. 
Kickoff will be set for 2:30 
p.m. South Bend time in West Lafayette, Ind.

"As of right now, no [I don't think I'm ready to be the starter]," he said. "I think Carlyle is our starter. He's there for a reason. He's a great quar­terback, and I have faith in him." 
After one of his worst per­formances as the Irish signal caller, Holiday still feels confi­dent at the helm of the Notre Dame offp,nse. Against the Wolverines, Holiday was just 5­of-15 for 55 yards and one

And in the weekly press con­ference Tuesday, Irish head coach Tyrone Willingham con­firmed that lloliday was still the starter for the time being. 
"Well. we've said Carlyle's growth has continued, and it has," Willingham said. "I think he's getting better. There are points sometimes where that may not be visible.... Carlyle has still identified himself as the best quarterback." 
If Holiday continues to strug­gle as he has in the first two games of the season, the Irish coaches may turn to the rela­tively untest­ed Quinn to 
enough to help the team win," 
Holiday said. "I just know I 
need to step it up a whole extra 
notch in practice in order for us 
to be able to win the ball game. The pressure's not there, it's just me. I need to step it up, forget about every thing and just go out and play." 
In Notre Dame's first day back on the practice field Tuesday, Irish players and coaches said the number of snaps that both quarterbacks took in practice was pretty much the same as previous days. 
"They've been pretty much the same," Diedrick said. "We've kind of weeded Pat [Dillingham] out a little bit. He's been working with the scout team, so it's probably about a to handle the 
responsibili­ties-both mental and physical -that come with the territory of being the Irish starter in just his first year in South Bend. 
"I feel comfortable right now," Quinn said. "I have a pretty good grasp. Of course, I'm a true freshman, so I don't have the experience to back that up, but mentally I have a good grasp on the system. 
"I think the coaches have pre­pared us to be pretty mentally tough. I think that every time I go out here, whether it be a good situation or bad situation, I feel like I'm learning, and that's what I want to do the whole entire year."

Irish set a nutnber of school records in S.C. 
Special to The Observer 
The Notre Dame women's golf team capped off one of the finest team performances in school history with a six­shot win at the Cougar Classic, which was completed Tuesday at the Yeamans Hall Golf Course in Hanahan, S.C. The Irish led virtually the entire way in the 54-hole tournament and wound up setting a school-record with a team score of 25-over par 889 (285-304-300). shattering the old mark by 43 strokes (932 at the 2002 Adidas Fall Invitational). 
It was Notre Dame's first tournament championship on the road since the 2001 William & Mary Invitational. The Irish defeated six of the teams who beat them at the NCAA regional qualifiers last season. 
Individual records also were plentiful for Notre Dame dur­ing its trip to the Palmetto State. Coming into the two­day competition, the school record for the lowest 54-hole score by an individual was 224, set by Alicia Murray at the 1994 Indiana Invitational. 
Nearly a decade later, not one, but three Irish players topped Murray's mark, led by Noriko Nakazaki who fired a school-record 217 (69-72-76) to finish second overall. Co­captain Shannon Byrne and Katie Brophy carded match­ing scores of 223 to wind up in a tie for seventh place in the individual standings. 
Stacy Brown helped clinch the team title for Notre Dame, registering a final-round 74 to earn a 25th-place tie at 229 (72-83-74). Karen Lotta com­pleted the five-player Irish lineup, finishing tied for 48th place at 237 (78-80-79). 
In the team competition, Notre Dame began the final round tied for first place with Big East rival Miami (Fla.) at 13-over par 589. 
However, the Hurricanes faded on the final day and were overtaken by 2003 NCAA regional qualifier Furman, which wound up in second place at 895 (294-300­301). Miami was third at 897 (296-293-308), with North Carolina State (299-302-307­
908) and Mississippi (301­302-307-910) rounding out the top five.

strong offensive night," Kinder said. "We're going to be fired up, motivated and ready to go." 
Kinder is joined on the front lines by outside hitter Emily Loomis and middle hitters Lauren Kelbley and Lauren Brewster. Loomis leads the team in hitting with a .325 hitting percentage to go along with 3.81 kills per game. 
Meanwhile, Kelbley hits .311 and averages 3.29 kills per game. Brewster racks up 
3.16 kills per game, while 
leading the team in blocking 
(1.28 blocks per game). 

Kinder is joined by her sis­ter Jessica, who leads the team with 16 aces and 3.19 digs per game. Their senior leadership, with the two being co-captains, has been crucial for the young Irish. 
"I think we both take full responsibility for the team, win or lose," Kristen Kinder said. "It is our jobs to get the team going." 
The Kinders know that tonight's game will be crucial, as Purdue leads the all-time series 11-6. The Boilermakers took the first nine matches, beginning in 1983, and ending in 1989, when thPe Irish were finally victorious. 
Purdue is among the best in the Big Ten, ranking third in hitting percentage 
(.282). assists (15.41 per game), kills (17 per game) and aces (1.91 per game). 
However, the Irish arc up to the challenge and eager for revenge from last year's defeat, with the Kinders look­ing to lead the Irish back into the win column. 
"No matter what happens, it's on our shoulders to make it better," Kristen Kinder said. "We shouldn't have a problem bouncing back."

WOMEN'S INTERHALL BLUE LEAGUE 
Breen-Phillips' offense leads Babes to 2-0 start 
By STEVE COYER, RACHEL SCIIIROS AND KATIE WAGNER 
Spons Writers 
Brcnn-Phillips used a relent­lPSS first half offensive attack and solid second half play to dPfPat Farley 35-13 Tuesday night in women's interhall football action. 
The lirst half opened up with a quick drive down the field by BrnPn-l'hillips. A 30-yard pass across thP middle set up a 5­yard touchdown pass for the Babns. After shutting down Farley's offense, they soon had the ball back and were driving down the field for another seore. Breen-Phillips quarter­back Traci Kazmerski ran it in for a touchdown in what would be the first of her three rushing touchdowns. 
"IKazrnerskil seemed really sharp out there this game with clean execution and accurate passes," Babes captain Kelly l>eeklman said. 
Kazrnnrski finished the game 10-of-17 with one passing touchdown. Erin Powell also had two key receptions for B r ~~en-Phi IIi p s that Ie ad to srores. 
l.ooking to answer after the lopsided first half. Farley's FinPst came out looking strong on their opening drive. After t ~~ u 2 0 -ya r d r u n s s pIi t t he defense, second -year quarter­back Katie Popick connected on a 30-yard touchdown pass. Later in the half she would also complete a pass for 50 yards that led to another touchdown. 
Concerning the stark con­trast between the team's first and second half performances, Popick said, "We only had two practices but once we got the first half jitters out we were able to go out there and play awesome." 
Eventually however, the Babes proved resilient enough to keep their first-half lead. A goal line stand by Breen­Phillips's defense late in the half essentially ended Farley's valiant comeback. 
"We definitely exceeded expectations and were able to come out there the second half and play well against a team with more size and speed than us," Farley coach Ben O'Connor said. 
The win for Breen-Phillips puts them at 2-0 on the year and gives them a reputation for their quick offense and stingy defense. Besides just being a confidence builder, this game makes it clear that the Babes are serious about a playoff run. 
Welsh 7, Walsh 0 
An evenly matched pair of defensive lines kept the sus­
pensc high at Tuesday night's game between Walsh and Welsh. It looked to be a shutout for both teams until th·e Welsh score during the clock's final countdown. When played concluded only moments later the end result was a 7-0 win for the Whirlwinds. 
In this defensive-minded game, possession changed several times within the open­ing minutes of the game as each team's defense was able to prevent the opposition from earning a first down. 
Although there were several completed passes made by the Walsh offense, too many were missed to offset the Welsh Family defense. Similarly, the Whirlwind running game couldn't overcome the Wild Women's opposition. 
Over the course of play, the Whirlwinds picked off four passes that continually broke the Wild Women's momentum. These interceptions came from Mary Prendergast, Lauren Osterhus and Kacey Hack, who had two to her credit. 
Standouts on the Walsh team were also members of an aggressive defense. Carly Belle's sacks led the Walsh defensive line in keeping Welsh Family away from the goal line. Also playing strong and responsible for the key 

interception of a Whirlwind pass was Amanda Borys. 
Both teams were getting frustrated with the scorel,ess game when Welsh's Mary Murphy finally broke through for a touchdown and subse­quent extra point. This last minute push was demonstra­tive of the on the field confi­dence coach Brian Adams said the team has been working on. 
Captain Katie Sprinz also cited the team still not coming together yet as another goal. 
"Our girls don't always work as one yet, but they really came out and played hard the whole game." said Spirnz. 
The goal for the future Walsh games will be develop­ing a constant high level of play, especially in the offen­sive line. 
"We need to be more consis­tent and bring our drives for the score into the second half," Walsh captain Colleen Gannon said. 
Pasquerilla West 12, Pangborn 6 
Coming into Tuesday night's game, the amount of practice time held by Pangborn and Pasquerilla West was very dif­ferent. The result of the game matched the preparation by each team as the Purple Weasels defeated the Phoxes 12-6. 
Pasquerilla West has been practicing for weeks in prepa­
ration for the start of the interhall season while Pangborn only held four prac­tices before the season start­ed. 
During Pangborn's first pos­session, freshman Trish Connolly scored the f'irst touchdown of the game and put the Phoxes (0-2) ahead early. She caught a 25-yard pass, ran it to the 2-yard line and scored on the next play. 
Pasquerilla West's Heather Van lloegarden quickly retali­ated, scoring two touchdowns to put her team in the lead at the half. 
Pangborn had several huge runs in the second half and got within 12 yards of scoring, but Pasquerilla West kept the Phoxes out of the end zone. 
"I was very happy about it." Pangborn captain Katie Murray said. "We didn't lose focus and we all kept the momentum up". 
The Phoxes haven't started off too well in dropping their first two games. Their youth­ful roster has gotten much needed experience. 
"We are a young team. a new team. and we're rebuild­ing," Pangborn's Katie Murphy said.

Holiday still the man 
Quinn says he isn't ready to take over starting job

Irish program is ready to say that the true freshman from Dublin. Ohio will be able to unseat starter Carlyle Holiday for the next game with Michigan State. 
"I guess you compare [Quinn] to a non­typical freshman," Irish offensive coordi­nator Bill Diedrick said. "He's very intense, very self driven and very competi­tive. lie does a great job of preparing himself, See Also and he's getting close. 
"ESPN moves

Even Quinn, himself. acknowledges that he does not feel like he is ready to sup­plant Holiday after just over a month in the Irish system.

Belles try to extend w-in streak 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER Associate SportS Fdi ror 
Saint Mary's would lovn to keep their winning ways going on the road. 
The Belles are curTPntly on a four-game winning stn~ak, but all those wins have been at horne. 
That stroak gets a real test today as Saint Mary's (8-4, 1-2 in the MIA!\) trawls to Adrian (6-4, 1-1 MIAA) in a k(~y confPr­ence matchup. 
"Adrian is always a good solid team." Belles coach JuliP Schroeder-Biek said. "They have this middle hitter who ·r believe might be tlw best mid­dle hitter out of all our MIAA opponents." 
The middle hitter in question is Lauree Dermyer. who !Pads the B·ulldogs with 170 kills (4.4 7 kills per game) and is tied for the team lead with 1<J sPrvice aces. She also has an impres­sive .445 hitting pern~ntage. 
Libero Kacie Ehinger is i\drian's defensive leader with a total of 180 digs through 10 matches. 
"Our practice today was simi­lar to \Vhat we practiced against Calvin [where the Belles lost in three games!," Schroeder-Hick said. "We have to be able to defend that great middle attack Adrian has." 
Adrian will need to look to have its defense ready as well, as the Belles' offense feeds ofT its outside attackers -especial­ly freshman Kristen Playko. 
Playko has adjusted to the college game quicker than per­haps anyone could imagine. She is currently tied for the MIAA lead in kills, and holds the high­est kill-per-game average in the entire conference. 
She is the only freshman in the top 10 in kills, and also has made the top ten lists in service aces (third, with 0.77 per game) and digs (ninth, with 3.85 per game). 
With two talented individuals 
in Dermyer and Playko. and two 
teams hungry for an MIAA win, 
the match should be an enter­
taining one. 
"I am really excited and think it's going to be a great match," Schroeder-Hick said. 
Following the Adrian match, Saint Mary's returns home and continues its conference sched­ule by facing Alma Sunday at 1 p.m.
