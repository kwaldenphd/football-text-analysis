Hassenger Tells Conference of Future of Catholic Education 
Dr. Robert L. Hassenger, head of Notre Dame's Office of Educa­tional Research·, told a group which included school board members, diocesan school em­ployees, teachers and administra­tors that, "the future of Catholic education is bound up in the in­creasingly familiar 'PPBS' -poli­cy, programming, budgeting sys­tems:'Hassenger said that, "PPBS is objective-setting, planning, pro­gramming, analysis of costs, cost­effectiveness, cost-benefits, bud­geting, performing, measuring, appraising ia light of programs and objectives, followed by more planning, programming, analy­zing, etc. It cannot replace judg­ment, experience and intuition. But it provides a better base for judgment; a more rational frame­work to capitalize on experience, more information to fertilize intuition." 

Hassenger's talk touched on some interesting facts unearthed by recent research on Catholic education. According to Hassen­ger. Catholic elementary school

operating costs are half those of Catholic high schools, but are rising twice as fast and may catch up; Catholic high schools would appear to be less effective per dollar expended with regard to significant increments of religious understanding and behavior, as 
currently measured; many reli­gtous communities have suffered by not receiving enough for their members' teaching to cover the full costs they incur; the poor must spend proportionately more of their incomes for Catholic schooling than their more af­fluent co-religionists; and that evidence from the Greely-Rossi and Notre Dame studies indi­cates that CCD programs "had minimal effectiveness in the re­ligious education of the average

faculty is in the forefront of community development here. We now have scenes in which a faculty member demands of Father Riehle, "Father, I want to know. Will the Faculty Senate be con­sulted in the new Student Manual?" 
In the realm of the clergy, too, a transformation is taking place. 
We still have a paternalistic administration which shows extreme re­
luctance to change plus a contingent of old priests who firmly dis­
approve of everything except football and the Grotto. However, 
nowadays many young priests here are deeply involved in activities 
which would have ten years ago been considered just short of heresy. 
Even as Fathers Hesburgh and Joyce flanked General Walt on the 
reviewing stand at the ROTC ceremonies young priests of the Holy 
Cross order marched in the anti-war demonstration. 
As a new Notre Dame develops, though, a contradiction is readi­
ly apparent. The authoritarian structure of the University, the tre­
ditions of Notre Dame, and finally the Administration hierarchy 
are not compatible with the transformation taking place in person­
nel. Despite an activist student administration there is as yet no 
self-government. Notre Dame is still thought of as ~ymbolic of tra­
ditional Catholicism, unquestioned patriotism, and football. Finally, 
even as Rich Rossie and Chuck Nau take over student government, 
Riehle and McCarragher·emain the men with which they must deal. 
The incompatibility of personnel and institution was apparent 
last Tuesday on Green Field. You could only get the feeling that 
there was an enormous gulf between that symbolized by ROTC 
and that symbolized by Rossie. At the same time it became obvious 
that those who comprise the new Notre Dame are not satisfied with 
the institutions, traditions, and hierarchy of the University. This 
was one of the first open confrontations between the new and the 
old which we have had around here. It will not be the last. Even as 
Father Hesbrugh passed the protestors gazing stolidly ahead it could 
only be a foregone conclusion that some day soon he will have to 
be cognizant of them.

Frosh Baseball 

The freshman baseball team split a doubleheader with Lewis College in Chicago Smday. Irish starters won the opener 5-3, but the reserves dropped the nightcap 8-3. 
The Blues started slowly in the first half and actually trailed 6-3 at 9:49 of the second quarter. The Whites were led by freshman quarterback Joe Theismann, who completed 20 passes himself for 277 yards. 
A 27-tard field goal by Halfback Bob Gladieux gave the Blues a 3-0 lead. After a 42-yard pass play from Hanratty to Seymour, the Varsity stayed on the ground. Dashes by Ed Ziegler, Gladieux and Jeff Zimmerman brought the ball down to the \\hite 9 yardline. An offside penalty moved the ball five yards closer and Bob booted it hime from the 17. 
The Whites were helped by stiff-finger­
ed Coley O'Brien, who fumbled away two punts. In all fairness to O'Brien he has not received intensive training this spring 

at safety position. On his third try, Coley latched onto the ball and hauled it 40 yards. 
Theismann drove th.e Whites 73 yards in nine plays for their first touch­down. He passed to Chw;k Landolfi, Tom Eaton and Dewey Poskon to move the ball to the enemy 35. Theismann rolled 10 yards to the 2, then handed off to full­back Bill Barz a play later for the score. Eaton and Poskon brought praise from Head Coach Ara Parseghian for their ex­cellent play. Eaton grabbed eight passes for 81 yards, Poskon seven for I 07. Hanratty regained the lead for the Blues with a 79-yard drive which took only 
1:05. Terry did it through the air, hitting 
Seymour for 32 and 10 yards, Craig Stark for 12, Gladieux for nine and Sey­mour for the final 17'. Gladieux con­verted for a 1 ().6 Varsity lead': 
The Blues dominated the second half, rev4!rsing a lethargic performance that had Parseghian shaking his head after the game. O'Brien's 40-yard punt return led to the first score, Hanratty sneaking the final yard. Another successful Gladieux placement and the scoreboard read 17-6. 
O'Brien replaced Hanratty at the helm for the varsity and drove the Blues to their third touchdown. Safetyman Tom Quinn got the drive rolling by picking off a Theismann pass and fleeing 35 yards to the White 34. Zimmerman went over from the 7 and O'Brien added a two-point conversion. 
The final varsity score came at 9:47 of the fourth quarter. Ron Dushney scam­pered virtually untouched for 11 yards and the score. Ziegler's run made it 33-6. 
Theismann took his mates 66 yards to score at I :33, Highlight of the drive was a 
safety-valve pass to Barz. The 6-2, 220 pounder rumbled 43 yards before being hauled down by Ernie Jackson at the 16. Eaton took Theismann's pass three yards for the touchdown, then took another pass for the two-point conversion. 
Parseghian expressed pleasure with the scrimmage, although he admitted that the Varsity needed work. Ara explained the great Hanratty-Seymour first half success by pointing out that Jim Sheahan and Don Reid were missing from the White secon­dary with injuries. Ara also commentedon the play of freshman Tim Kelly and Jim Wright. "Both linebackers played fairly well. It takes a lot of work to play that tough outside position well."
