Nomination of Gates withdrawn by Reagan 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Newly in­stalled White House chief of staff Howard Baker announced Monday that Robert Gates' nomination as CIA director was being withdrawn at Gates' request and said President Reagan was ready to tackle the Iran-Contra problem head-on in a speech to the nation. 
Appearing formally for the first time before the White House press corps, Baker said of Reagan: "I've never seen him better than today." 
Baker said "the original plan" was for Reagan to an­nounce a new nominee at the same time Gates' withdrawal was announced, but "it didn't quite come together that way." He said choosing a successor for William Casey as director of the CIA was "an urgent item on the president's agenda." 
Baker also read to reporters a letter from Gates to the pres­ident, saying, "It is apparent that there is strong sentiment in the Senate to await comple­tion, at minimum, of the work of the Senate Select Committee on Iran before acting on my nomination." 
"I believe a prolonged period of uncertainty would be harm­ful to the Central Intelligence Agency, the intelligence com­munity and potentially to our national security," he said.

TRENTON, N.J. -A law­maker who got a job at a state mental institution although he used the name of a dead con­victed rapist said Monday he found patient abuse and inci­dents that "made 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' look like a picnic." 
State Sen. Richard Codey said he watched employees corral and prod patients with a pointer, heard a co-worker brag of assaulting sleeping female residents and was or­dered not to intervene when a disturbed patient stuffed ciga­rette ashes and butts into his mouth. 
State officials responded by launching an investigation of hiring practices and conditions at Marlboro Psychiatric Hospi­tal, where Corley spent six days as an orderly last month. 
"If in fact the picture he des­cribed is an accurate one, it's an unacceptable, if not out­rageous, situation," said Human Services Commis­sioner Drew Altman. 
Corley said he proved his guess that applications of prospective workers at mental facilities are rarely scrutinized. 
In 1985, he alleged, more than 300 of the nearly 4,000 employees at New Jersey's seven psychiatric hospitals had criminal records. Under a policy in effect since October 1985, the Department of Human Services requires background checks, including checks of fin­gerprints and Social Security numbers, for all prospective employees of state psychiatric hospitals. 
To determine if hiring prac­
tices had improved since then, 
Codey applied for a job at 
Marlboro, which has about 800 
adult residents, using the 
name, address and birthdate of 
a dead convicted rapist and the 
Social Security number of a 
dead convicted armed robber. 
He described himself as an un­
employed restaurant worker. 
The 40-year-old Democrat 
said he was hired as an orderly after interviews with two admi­nistrators that took 30 minutes, and began work Feb. 17. 

He said he was shocked by cavalier attitudes among fel­low employees and in witness­ing the abuse of patients. He said one worker told him he couldn't wait until evenings, when he would sexually assault sleeping female residents. 
Codey, in his third Senate term after serving eight years in the Assembly, said some employees not only condoned beatings, but also learned how to administer them without get­ting caught. 
"One person said 'If you hit them and someone sees you, you get fired. So what you have to do is put them in a closet and then give them a beating,"' Codey said. 
He described seeing a patient eat cigarette butts and ashes: 
"I saw him get up at 3 in the morning and dive into a trash can to get cigarette ashes ....

Adnlim-·s-tr-a-ti_o_n_a_v--o-id-s-'lrangate' by revoking Scholastic suspension 
I had already outlined a very sarcastic article about the suspension of Scholastic magazine last Thursday when suddenly a great misfor­tune had to occur: the Office of Student Activ­ities rescinded the suspension and retreated from its original position. 
Today was supposed to have been D-Day. I would have pointed out that not only had the administration violated its own rule book, but while the Office of Student Activities was suspending a student magazine for printing a blurry picture of what looked like one person leaning over another (if one squinted), it was showing such wholesome, values-oriented flicks like "9 112 Weeks" in the Engineering Auditorium. 
But what did the administration do? At the last moment it blinked, and poor me was left with no story. 
Or so I thought last Thursday. Yet after some reflection I realized there is a very important story here. 
Right now the administration looks rather foolish, now that it has in effect admitted that it was wrong all along, even if it hasn't exactly said so. Still there are worse things than looking foolish once in a while. One of those things is trying to save face, regardless of the costs. 
The prime example of this, of course, is the national premiere of "Bonzo II" which came to television stations everywhere with the dis­closure of the White House's attempted courtship with the Ayatollah. As it was, of course, the President acted with transcendent stupidity in authorizing the Israelis to ship mis­siles to Iran because of the "moderates" in the Ayatollah's regime and in letting Poindexter and North wreak their mischief with the Con­tras. 
Yet by pretending to be infallible and denying any regret for the action at the onset, Reagan made an embarrassing issue into a disastrous one. People quickly put two and two together: If the President is acting totally phlegmatic now, what other scandals has he presided over by simply smiling and nonchalantly saying "Well ...." 
By contrast, the administration of this Uni­versity quashed its own version of the Iran­Contra affair--1 suppose if the suspension had lasted longer we would have eventually called it Scholasticgate to be gimmicky like the na­tional press--by concerning itself more with doing.right rather than saving face. 
Here also officials did not seem to be thinking too clearly, regardless of the good intentions, if one compares their action to what is prescribed in duLac. Yet in this case there was a difference in that officials were not afraid to make an admission that they had made a mis­take, even if the admission was only tacit. 
Chris Julka 
Copy Editor 

I don't believe in complimenting the admin­istration too much, for it leads to boring, schmaltzy writing. Also there is much to criticize in the Office of Student Activities' "shoot first, ask questions later" approach to the Scholastic. Still, one has to admit that the administration deserves credit for backing down where it could have held out until the end of the semester just for appearance's sake. 
By contrast one may say that if Reagan really believed that 240 million people are so obtuse that they would stick to their VCRs and forget the entire scandal, then the Teflon President has a teflon brain. Yet he heeded conventional wisdom. Looking good comes first, as it does with actors, corporations, and job applicants. It's like that antiperspirant commercial with the coach who lost the superbowl saying "Whatever you do, never let them see you sweat." 
Yet although last Thursday the Office of Stu­dent Activities may have looked a bit wet under the armpits, it managed to make its Irangate last only four days. Maybe when the next Re­publican President is elected sometime after the year 2000, he will have enough intelligence to realize that antiperspirant commercials can sometimes be wrong.

Erroneous broadcast says Rockford hit by tornado 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -A national Weather Service bulletin that erroneously said the city of Rockford had been demolished by a tornado was sent to hundreds of Mid­west radio and television stations Monday and read on the air by some announcers. 
One broadcaster whose station used the bulletin said "that's very upsetting to find out you may have panicked thousands of people needlessly." 
The bulletin, sent on the weather service's wire at 4:55a.m., said: 
"At 4:35 a.m. CST a tor­nado hit the Rockford, Ill., weather office. This storm was moving southeast at 50 mph. This is a dangerous storm. Take cover immedi­ately. 
"The entire town of Rock­ford has been demolished. If you are in the path of this tornado, you should go to a basement shelter if avail­able . . . Abandon cars and mobile homes." 

Five minutes later, a dis­claimer was sent explaining that the bulletin was trans­mitted by mistake, said meteorologist Steve Kahn at the service's Chicago office. 
The bulletin was part of a test being conducted to prepare for the upcoming tornado season, and was de­signed only for weather ser­vice personnel, Kahn said. 
He blamed a change in computer software at the service's Chicago office for letting the bulletin get out. 
Kahn said a weather ser­vice worker in Rockford who saw the bulletin called the

Proportional system could stabilize electorate 

We Americans like to think that we have one of the fairest electoral sys­tems in the world. When we go into the polling booth on election day we are confident that our voice is being heard and that the will of the people will be translated into a truly representative result. We look askance at nations such as the Soviet Union where no choice is offered the electorate and where the Communist Party's preselected can­didate is assured of victory. When we look at the whopping ninety-nine per­cent plus majorities secured by such candidates, we rightly question the value of popular participation where there is no real competition to begin with. 
David Koyzis 
guest column 

But what about our own electoral sys­tem? The choice between two candi­dates is considerably preferable to no choice at all. Yet it must be admitted that even our electoral system effec­tively operates so as to limit our choices on election day. Most of us have had the experience of going into the polling booth, reading the names of the Dem­ocratic and Republican candidates for a certain office, and wondering if there were no one better to vote for. Of course, there are usually other parties on the ballot, for example, the Socialist Worker, Prohibition, Libertarian, Citi­zen's, and so forth. But everyone realizes that these other parties have no chance to win. Even when an Inde­pendent presidential candidate, such as John Anderson in 1980, succeeds in get­ting enough public attention, sympa­thetic people are afraid to waste their votes. 
Why is this? Is it simply a matter of Americans being loyal to the two major parties? Apparently not. Recent studies have consitently shown a decline in party loyalty over the last generation. Whereas previous genera­tions had been willing to identify them­selves with one of the two major par­ties, many more people are now calling themselves independents. Yet despite the rise of independentism, nearly all national and state offices are still monopolized by Republicans and Democrats. This suggests that someth­ing else may be at work. 
In 1951 Maurice Duverger wrote his classic "Political Parites" in which he argued that electoral systems largely determine party systems. Herein lies

the key to why we are stuck with the Democrats and Republicans. The United States operates for the most part under a single-member­constituency-district system. This means that a given geographical dis­trict elects one representative for nearly all offices at each level of gov­ernment. Even those districts that elect multiple representatives (for example, the fifty states with two senators each) usually elect them on a at-large basis. For purposes of representation in the federal House of Representatives, the nation is divided-often arbitrarily-into 435 districts of roughly equal popula­tion. Each district elects one represen­tative. This seems fair enough at first glance. 
But imagine that on election day the Democrats win fifty-one percent of the vote within every district. According to the current arrangement all 435 seats would thus be occupied by Democrats, despite the fact that forty-nine percent 
of the electorate voted Republican. More to the point, imagine an election in which the Republican candidate won forty-seven percent of the vote, the Democrat forty-six percent and, say, the Socialist seven percent with in each district. With elctions decided by plurality and not by absolute majority, an entirely Republican House would have been put in place by a minority of the electorate. Is this fair? 
In many countries, elections are decided by some form of proportional representation, often called simply PR. If the United States were to adopt aPR electoral system, the actual popular vote would be more faithfully reflected in the make-up of the House of Repre­sentatives. If forty-five percent of the American people voted Democratic, then forty-five percent of the House seats would go to Democratic candi­dates. If fifty-five percent voted Repub­lican, the same proportion of seats would be allocated to this party. Under such an arrangement, the danger of minorities either dominating or being locked-out would no longer be present. 
Some might object to the instituiton of PR on the grounds that it would lead to the end of our two-party system. This, they fear, would result in greater instability, as in present-day Italy or Fourth Republican France (1946-58), both of which are or were characterized by multiple parties and political frag­mentation. It is indeed likely that the adoption of PR would put an end to the two-party system. But a multi-party

system does not necessarily lead to in­stability or fragmentation, as is evident in such nations as Norway, Sweden, and the Netherlands, whose political sys­tem are multi-partied yet highly stable. 
Moreover, the decline of the Demo­cratic and Republican parties and the rise of other parties might actually lead to greater stability, since real or poten­tial minorities would be more fairly represented and thus more readily heard within the legislative arena. Un­der our present system minorities are represented only if they happen to reside in a district where they are in the majority. But most minorities in our country, particularly ideological and religious minorities (i.e., minorities of conviction, as opposed to minorities of interest), are scattered across the country and can claim majority status in no single region. If they wish to be heard, and if neither of our two major parties adequately represents their position, then they must resort to extra-parliamentary means. Adoption of PR, possibly in combination with our current district system, would not only serve to prevent future instability, but would ensure more fair representation of all groups and communities in this country who wish their voies to be heard.

P.O.BoxQ 
Speaker's motives not prescribed in invitation Dear Editor: 
My colleagues Fred Freddoso and Janet Smith's Viewpoint piece on the­recent abortion debate (February 20, 1987) displayed many a discontent, but it was difficult to locate their precise target. They endorsed the idea and the fact of a debate, but were unhappy with the choice of Maguire, and most un­happy because Maguire predictably turned the invitation itself into a pretext for legitimizing "dissent" abor­tion among Catholics. So much is clear; but they appear to charge Richard McBrien, another colleague, with re­sponsibility for Maguire's misuse of the invitation. In the course of that indirect and curious misattribution of responsi­bility, they suggest yet other topics which might be debated here, to give their proponents "the opportunities to claim that our invitation itself renders their position a respectable Catholic po­sition?" 
That innuendo, my friends, is unfair. You may disagree with a colleague's choice of speakers, but do not try to saddle the ones who organize events with responsibility for the rhetorical use which those invited may make of their invitation. That is not only misas­signing responsibility, but suggesting a norm for deciding public speakers which would severely restrict our stu­dent' opportunities to hear diverse viewpoints -lest those invited misuse our invitation to their advantage. 

(Incidentally, the alternative speakers suggested -Michael Tooley or Judith Thomson-would have been singularly inept in a theolgical debate.) The sub­stantive results of the debate can only have delighted my colleagues, as they indeed aver, so why should they fasten on Maguire's misuse of the event to gain publicity, and then attempt to at­tribute that fault to the person who in­vited him? It certainly seems gratuitous to proceed to denigrate a col­league for staging an event which so admirably served both university and church. And if not gratuitous, why?

The Belles finished with a 12­8 record. Wood attributes his team's success to consistency and balance on the team. 
"Two out of the three goals I set in Nov. were reached and I am very pleased with that. We qualified for districts and we had a winning record," said Wood. 
Junior Steph Duke believes that team unity helped them to play well. 
"We got along great both on and off the court, and that made a difference,'' said Duke. "It allowed us to get to know each other a lot better and begin to anticipate the styles of play on the court." 
"The closeness also gave us confidence in each other while we played," agreed freshman Gallagher. "It made the fresh­man get us to the different style of play at this level." 
Although the Radke sisters were often in the spotlight this season, there was never any one player who the Belles depended on. 
"We could always count on the forwards and center to come through if the backcourt was being pressured and vise versa," said Julie Radke. "That gave us the confidence of not having to rely on any par­ticular people. It was also the same way with the sub­~titutes."

splits pair over-weekend 
By KELLY TOWNSEND Sports Writer 
In men's tennis action this past weekend, Notre Dame came out with an even record losing to Ohio State and defeat­ing Ohio University. These two matches also keep this season's record even at 5-5. 
The action against Ohio State was characterized by close matches and valiant efforts by the Irish. At the number-one singles spot, Tim Carr started with a strong 6-4 win in the first set, but was edged 6-7 in the second and dropped the last set 4-6. Dan Walsh also took his match into three sets, emerg­ing with a 7-6, 3-6, 6-1 win against his Buckeye opponent. 
The doubles teams faired better with wins recorded by Tim Carr and Dave Reiter and Mike Wallace and Sean O'Brian, who recorded a 6-1, 6-2 blowout. Despite the strong wins, the Irish were over­powered by the Buckeyes, losing the match 6-3. 
"We thought we had a chance against them," said Head Coach Tom Fallon, "but they turned out to be too strong for us." 
Against Ohio University, Notre Dame evened out their record this weekend with wins by Brian Kalbas (6-1, 6-2), Dave Reiter (6-2, 6-3) and Dan Walsh, who held off his op­ponent with two sets of 7-5. 
In doubles, the Irish won by forfeit in the number-two match and lost the number three match, 8-6. The first doubles match was cancelled due to a lack of time and the Irish ended up with a 6-3 win over Ohio University. 
Fallon saw several encour­aging signs in the match against Ohio University. 
"Kalbas' win shows that he is on the way to recovering," said Fallon. "Couple this with the improved condition of Tony Cahill, and our team's strength will almost be up to par." 
The Irish will need their strength this weekend when they challenge long-time foe Wisconsin and follow up with hard-hitting Gustavus Adophus.

Irish notch 20th victory, ranking as they dump Brooklyn College 

By BOB KEMPER Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's bas­ketball team abandoned its heart-stopping brand of play Monday evening and coasted to a 76-57 victory over outmanned Brooklyn College. 
It was the seventh-consecutive victory for the Irish and insured them of their fourth 20-win season in as many years. 
Mter Mark Stevenson made a layup off an offensive rebound to put the Irish up 4-2 at 19:26 of the first half, the Irish never relinquished the lead. Senior co-captain Scott Hicks helped the Irish take con­trol early as he drilled four jumpers in the first ten minutes of the game. Notre Dame en­tered the locker room at the half with a 38-29 lead. 
After the intermission, the Irish jumped to a comfortable 16-point lead. Gary Voce con­nected on a rebound goal and converted the three-point play after being fouled. Stevenson scored on a rebound goal and Rivers popped from 17 feet to finish off the 7-0 run. The defense complimented the of­fense as the Irish blocked seven shots and had six steals, most of which resulted in fast breaks. 

Fencers earn berth in NCAA finals

Yehuda Kovacs and Janice Hynes both took first place in the foil at the Great Lakes Fen­cing Championship as the men's and women's teams both claimed first place Saturday in Dearborn, Mich. 
The men claimed the first­place trophy for the fourth year in a row by outscoring rival Wayne State, 171-128. Kovacs' win marked the third year in a row that Notre Dame boasted of an individual foil winner. Kovacs won the title last year, 

ND takes 2nd in Alabama tourney 
. By PETE SKIKO Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame hockey 
team ended its regular season 
by taking second place in the 
first annual Alabama­
Huntsville Invitational this 
weekend. 
By splitting a pair of games 
over the weekend, the Irish 
finished the season with an 
overall record of 9-18-1 and are 
headed for the American Col­
legiate Hockey Association 
playoffs this weekend at the 
ACC. 
The Irish trounced little­
known Hawthorne College 7-1 
on Friday night, but dropped 
the final to the host, Huntsville, 
by a score of 3-2 in overtime on 
Saturday. 
Despite taking second in the 
tourney and finishing out the 
regular season with a loss, 
Head Coach Lefty Smith feels 
that his squad put forth one of its best efforts of the year against an improved Huntsville club, and believes that a certain amount of mo­mentum has been gained going into the opening round of playoffs this Friday night. 
"Heck, we've got to be opti­mistic," said Smith. "We didn't lose anybody to an injury, which is new, and we probably played about as well as I feel we can play against Huntsville in the final. A puck bounces over a stick of one of our defen­semen late in the game, and they (Huntsville) get the game­winner off of a breakaway. But there were enough bright spots to make me relatively happy." 
One of those bright spots was the play of center Mike McNeill, who was named the tournament's most valuable player. He was also named to the all-tournament team, along with teammates Pat Foley, Tom Mooney and goalie Lance and teammate Charles Higgs­co's undefeated Irish were so

But even on autopilot, DeCic-Madson. 
"The players that have been consistent all year are playing especially well lately," contin­ued Smith, "and hopefully that kind of leadership will inspire some good play this weekend." 
McNeill shares his coach's feeling that the team appeared to come closer together despite the loss to Huntsville. 
"Yeah, it was a tough loss," said the 6-1, 175-pound junior out of South Bend, "and it was another one of those games where you get into the locker room and say to yourself, 'How did we let another close one get away?' But we checked well and didn't let down after we won the first round. A lot of good things came out of the loss, and hopefully they'll show up, with us on the 'win' side against Lake Forest." 
Lake Forest will be Notre Dame's first-round opponent in the ACHA playoffs 

Irish Head Coach Digger Phelps was delighted to have another 20-victory season un­der his belt, the nth of his 16 years with the Irish. 
"Winning twenty games this season is an incredible feat for several reasons," said Phelps. "First of all, the graduation of Tim Kempton, Jim Dolan, Joe Price, and Kenny Barlow left us pretty bare. Secondly, David (Rivers) was involved in the tragic auto accident. Then we found out Keith Robinson would be ineligible for the season. When Western Ken­tucky beat us in the first game of the season, they showed us we were a long way from being a good basketball team. 
"Mter losing to Western Kentucky, I anticipated that we would only end up with about 16-18 wins. The fact that we are now ranked shows what we have gone through. Mter beating North Carolina, Duke, and DePaul, people believe in us. I think that David is primarily responsible for the success of this season. He didn't know how to die when he should have died." 
The Irish had their biggest lead of the night, 72-51, with 
2:45 left in the contest when the five starters retired to the bench. Chris Nanni and Steve Nicgorski fired up the previ-
Illnesses slow women's track club 
A lack of members prevented the Women's Track Club from participating in 10 of 13 events in last weekend's Notre Dame Invitational and caused the Irish to finish fourth in the four-team meet. 
Theresa Rice won the half-mile with a time of 2:20.06, Julia Merkle placed third in the mile at 5:20.43, Darlene Martin finished third it the shot put with a toss of 29-7 314 and Kathy Tammaro placed fourth in the shot put at 24-11. 
"We had a difficult time bercause many of our people were sick. Strep throat ran rampant through our team, but those people who we did put in did extremely well," said Head Coach Dan Ryan. "Theresa Rice ran against some tough runners from DePaul and Marquette, and she wasn't even challenged after the first lap. A time of 2:20 on our track is like 2:18 on another track. 

Steve Megargee 
Club Corner 

"I was pleased. We've got a young team. DePaul and Marquette have significantly more depth than we do. It's difficult to compete with teams like that, but we may as well jump in the deep end of the pool and get all the experience we can now." 
DePaul won the meet, followed by Marquette, Detroit and Notre Dame. 
For the second straight week, the Men's Volleyball Club had problems with a nationally ranked varsity team. But like last week, the Irish were able to recover from that loss to win the remainder of their matches for the week. 
Notre Dame opened their weekend in Ohio by dropping a match to tenth-ranked Ohio State, 7-15, 3-15, 3-15. 
"We have a problem against varsity teams. We came out ahead, 7-5, and just fell apart," said Club President John Sullivan. "We kind of realized who we were playing and thought that we weren't supposed to be ahead." 
The Irish swept Ohio State-Marion Friday, 15-2, 15-5, 15-4, then defeated Miami (Ohio) on Saturday, 15-9, 13-15, 15-3, 15-7. These wins moved Notre Dame to 14-3 for the season, 14-1 against club teams and 0-2 against varsity teams.

"Notre Dame is in the upper echelon of major college Divi­sion I basketball," said Brook­lyn head coach Mark Reiner, "and that is what we are reach­ing for. Notre Dame is playing as well as anyone in the country right now. We schedule games like this to help our program move in the right direction." 
"Although Notre Dame only had about a ten to fifteen point lead for most of the game, they have a quiet, conservative way of winning. We were banking on a letdown, especially after their grueling schedule late." 
Donald Royal led the Notre Dame scoring parade with 20 points to go along with his 10 rebounds. Mark Stevenson added 12 points, and David Rivers and Scott Hicks each chipped in eleven. 
Junior Frank Gregov equaled Royal's scoring production by pouring in 20 points for Kings men.
