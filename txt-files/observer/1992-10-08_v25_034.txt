The QLC's ultimate goal is to have the University open an on-site child care facility by the fall of 1993 that will serve the staff. faculty and graduate student's child care needs. 
The committee has already been successful at forcing the administration to address the needs of child care by precipi­tating the formation of the University Committee on Child 
Care by the Offirn of the Provost in March of 92. 
Representatives oi the QLC stated that the committee war­ranted the budget increase be­cause of the need to increase its outlets that serve to inform those interested in its cause. 
Their main method of publi­cizing their cause is through advertisements run in The Ob· server. Due to the high cost of these advertisements, QLC was not able to run as large an amount of advertisements as it desired.

Mother sues because child cannot read 
SANTA ANA, Calif.-The mother of a 10-year-old boy who made it to the fifth grade without being able to read or write filled a lawsuit seeking to close her son's school down. Lourdes Gutierrez maintains that her son, Roberto, suffered humiliation among his classmates be­cause educators at Glenn Martin Elementary School did not teach him properly. Her lawsuit, filed last week against the Santa Ana Unified School District, asks that the school be closed and that the money used to operate it be given as vouchers to students to pay for private school education. Roberto Gutierrez's first language is Spanish. His mother said she decided not to enroll him in a bilingual education program because she wanted him to learn English.

SMC alumna says racism still a problem in America 
By ANNA MARIE TABOR 
Saint Mary's Editor 
Racism is inherent in the system and its effects are scar­ring youths throughout Amer­ica, according to Saint Mary's alumna Rachel Tomas. 
Victims of racism are similar to victims of rape in that the healing process lasts a lifetime, Tomas said during her lecture at Saint Mary's yesterday titled, "Women of Color: Tales from an Inner-City Classroom." 
Racism surfaced in the thir­teenth century with the upper­class French and spread to Spain in the fifteenth century, she said. Religious castes be­came racial castes, she contin­ued. 
When Columbus came to America in 1492, "racism had gripped Europe to a large de­gree," Tomas said. 
The explorers found ways to justify stealing from the indige­nous peoples in the new world by claiming racial superiority, according to Tomas. Thus, she said, came the birth of "forced hereditary slavery." 
Black slavery in America can be attributed to de Gama who sailed around the Cape of Good Hope in 1498, she added. 
Tomas described the legal system structured to exclude blacks and the indigenous 
people from rights the Euro­pean whites enjoyed as "demoralizing." 
"Racism is a distinctly Euro­pean concept brought to the new world by Columbus," she said. "There is a continued le­gacy of racism today." 
Tomas recalled an incident that happened to her at home in Illinois over fall break one year. While buying drinks for her friends at a bar, a military officer approached her and said, "In the Philippines I can buy ten of your kind." 
Tomas said she "remembers the incident like a young child who falls off a bicycle for the first time and runs to her mother." 
This and other incidents have led her to conclude that "anger and hatred are normal reactions to experiences in white America." 
There is a problem of mi­norities denying their heritages, especially in pre-college years, Tomas said. She admitted to asking her mother to fix hamburgers and tuna casserole instead of Philippino food when her friends visited. 
Tomas said stereotypes and racism are due to fear and ig­norance and Americans are "challenged to re-educate and empower each other, and carve out our own paths." 
Six killed in military plane crash 
BERKELEY SPRINGS, W.Va. (AP) -Milton Barnhart was sitting at his kitchen table Wednesday morning when an Air National Guard transport plane crashed into his house in a huge fireball, killing all six people on board. 
Barnhart's house was de­stroyed, but he escaped without serious injury, and only his hair singed. 
Witnesses said one wing or engine on the four-engine plane, which was on a routine training flight, appeared to be on fire before the crash. 
The turboprop C-130E was part of the 167th Tactical Airlift Group based at the Eastern West Virginia Regional Airport at Martinsburg, 20 miles east of Berkeley Springs in the state's Eastern Panhandle. The unit's 12 aircraft were used to ferry troops and supplies during the Persian Gulf War. 
Air National Guard Maj. Ed­ward Dockeney Jr. said an Air Force investigation board will convene to determine the cause of the crash. He would not discuss possible causes. 


USDA offers money for homeless children 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Federal money is now available to help public homeless shelters feed their pre-school children, an Agriculture Department official said Wednesday. 
Betty Nelsen, administrator of USDA's Food and Nutrition Service, said the agency is so­liciting grant applications from city-and county-run shelters seeking federal money to feed infants and toddlers. 
The feeding program had been limited to private, non­profit shelters until this sum­mer, when a new law opened the program to publicly run shelters. 
According to the Congres­sional Budget Office, there are nearly 25,000 children under age 6 living in emergency shelters. Other federal pro­grams, such as the school lunch program, feed school-age children. 
Little, however, is done for younger brothers and sisters who remain in the shelters all day, says Sen. Patrick Leahy (D­Vt.) and chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. 
Nelsep said the agency is in­forming states and announcing the availability of government money in magazines and other publications used by homeless center administrators.

El AI flight 'black box' could provide clues 
AMSTERDAM, Netherlands 
(AP) -Investigators found the 
charred and dented flight data 
recorder of an El AI Boeing 747 
Wednesday, saying the "black 
box" could provide clues to why 
the jet slammed into a subur­
ban apartment block. 

The briefcase-sized box was found as hundreds of searchers, sifting carefully through an unstable mountain of rubble and wreckage, pulled more bodies from the apartment building destroyed in Sunday's crash. 
By Wednesday night, 40 corpses had been removed from the smoldering rubble, but 250 people were still unaccounted for, according to City Hall spokesman Robert Kaercher. He said the missing were presumed dead. 
If confirmed, the toll would 
make it the world's deadliest air 
disaster in terms of deaths on 
the ground. 
Authorities said a more pre­
cise casualty toll was impossible 
because an unknown number of 
illegal immigrants lived in the 
low-income apartment block. 
The recovery was also slowed because searchers were finding bits and pieces of bodies in the rubble, charred in the intense heat from the fuel-laden jumbo jet that exploded on impact. 
The Israeli airline said it was setting up an emergency fund to assist survivors of victims of the crash. 
Authorities said they hoped the flight recorder would pro­vide details of the last moments before the Boeing 7 4 7-200 cargo plane crashed into the 10-story building 10 miles east of Schiphol Airport.

And Clinton's plan to get the government involved in health care would only harm the sys­tem, he continued. "America has the best health care system in the world. We do not have a health care crisis in this coun­try, although there is a health insurance crisis." 
The answer to the education crisis is "competition," and not throwing further money at the problem, Barnes said. 
talking about." 

One example of Bush's lack of touch with Americans, accord­ing to Germond, was his at­tempt to relate to victims of the Los Angeles riots by comparing the city's damage to that caused by a storm at his vacation home in Maine. 
Bush has shifted from one catchword to another -and back -throughout his cam­paign, Germond said. The "change" issue was a difficult one because, in effect, Bush was campaigning against his own record, he said. 
The "trust" issue was re­placed by "family values," he said, which has mainly been an 
One advantage to today's Democratic Party is that it has "outgrown most of the litmus tests," Germond said, such as mandatory opposition to capital punishment, formerly necessary for candidacy. 
Questioned by Scully about the alleged censoring of Penn­sylvania anti-abortion Governor William Casey at the Demo­cratic national convention, and the question of whether the party has room for pro-life ad­vocates, Germond said, "I don't think anybody should expect their party to agree with them on all issues."

Most of the jobs created by Clinton's plan will be in small businesses, according to Blassingame. "Small businesses create most of the new jobs in this country and they need to flourish if we are all to prosper," he said. 
However, right now there are no indications that the job mar­ket for graduating seniors will improve in the immediate fu­ture, according to Kitty Arnold, director of Career and Place­ment Services at Notre Dame. 
"This is not a commentary on either candidate's program, but right now the economy does not show any foreseeable signs of improvement," Arnold said. 
Three years ago, companies conducted 11,000 job inter­views at Notre Dame, but only 7,800 last year, she said. "This is not a positive year, but it is not substantially worse than last year," she said.

"The big fish are eating the little fish up, and a number of positions are being squeezed out," he said. 
Many opportunities can be found by looking at smaller companies, Roberts said. 'The opportunities lie with anybody trying to bump off whoever's at top. You have to look at the sec­ond tier," he said. 
That phenomenon is espe­cially true in fields like aerospace, according to John Prette, president of the Notre Dame chapter of American Institute of Aeronautics and As­tronautics (AIAA). 
"Companies like Boeing aren't hiring, but there are some smaller companies that are strong right now, which is where people should be spreading their horizons and looking for jobs," Prette said. 
Aeronautics is still a field that is suffering from recent defense cuts, Prette said. "This is a field based on defense." 
The reverse seems to be true in the finance field, according to Amy Listerman, president of the Notre Dame Finance Club. "Big firms are recruiting, but the smaller firms might not be recruiting this year," she said. 

Listerman is not optimistic about the future job market. "It might be a slower recovery (than in past years) no matter who wins the election," she said. 
Julie Jedlinski, president of the Saint Mary's Management Club, is more optimistic about the job market. "Personally, I think we'll come out of the re­cession soon," she said. 
However, the candidates don't have the right plans to help the job market out, according to Listerman. "They have their ideas, but I don't see" how they will lead the U.S. out of a recession, she said. 
Roberts, on the other hand, thinks that a president can have a direct impact on the job market. 
He said, "The President can create a sense of optimism among the people, like when John F. Kennedy did when I was young."

Allies reach agreement on Bosnian 'no-fly zone' 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The Bush administration will con­tinue to seek the establishment of a "no fly" zone over Bosnia despite promises from Bosnian Serbs of an immediate halt to military flights over the country, a spokesman said Wednesday. 
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the pledges lack credibility because the Serbs have persisted in carrying out aerial attacks over Bosnia in violation of promises made six weeks ago. 
"They have not kept that commitment," Boucher said. 
President Bush called last Friday for a ban on Serb mili­tary flights over Bosnia and said he would be willing to uti­lize U.S. military assets to en­force any such ban. 
At the United Nations Wednesday, diplomats said the United States, France and Bri­tain reached agreement on a draft resolution to ban war­planes from flying over Bosnia. 
The United States had been advocating a strong enforce­ment provision in the resolution but bowed to French and British demands for a more cautious approach, the diplo­mats said. Under the proposed resolution, the sources said, U.N. personnel would be as­signed to monitor airfields and the possibility of an additional resolution to enforce the ban was left open. 
In a television interview Tuesday night, Acting Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger expressed understanding for the British and French positions. But, he said, the sit­uation "in and around Sarajevo and Bosnia is so disastrous now that we need to move hard and fast to prevent it from becoming worse." 
Establishment of a no-fly zone along with a U.N.-sponsored commission to investigate alleged atrocities in the former Yugoslavia have emerged as key elements of the Bush administration's efforts to end the fighting there. 
The U.N. Security Council approved the establishment of the war crimes commission Tuesday with the strong back­ing of the United States. 
Boucher said the United States already has provided U.N. officials with data on 50 "reliably attested incidents" in response to a prior Security Council resolution.

Serbians win strategic city in Bosnia 
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herze­govina (AP) -With a final push fought hand-to-hand on the streets, Se-rbs captured the northern border city of Bosan­ski Brod and with the victory widened their land corridor from eastern to western Bosnia. 
The Serbs followed up Tues­day's victory early today by de­stroying the bridge that was the last Croatian-Muslim-controlled link over the Sava River to Croatia. 
Meanwhile, heavy shelling was reported in the capital this morning, and some shells landed near the presidency building. Sarajevo radio termed it "one of the most hellish mornings since the beginning of the war" six months ago. 
Serb forces were poised to capture Orasje, the last Bosnian government stronghold on the southern bank of the Sava river. Its position was rendered almost indefensible by the sudden Serb capture of Bosanski Brod, 95 miles north of Sarajevo. 
Serbs, who now hold about 70 percent of the republic, seemed intent on eliminating the entire Bosnian enclave along the Sava River boundary with neighboring Croatia. It used to stretch for nearly 30 miles along the river and some 25 miles south. 
In the past, that enclave threatened the supply routes running from Serbia proper to areas held by Serb rebels in western Bosnia and central Croatia. 

Georgia gets closer to war 
TBILISI, Georgia (AP) -The Georgian intelligence chief ac­cused Russia on Wednesday of giving battle tanks to Abk­hazian separatists in Georgia's Black Sea coastal region, but the Russians denied it. 
In an effort to stop their slide toward war, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze talked by telephone Wednes­day, news agencies reported. Details were not released, but ITAR-Tass called the talk "sharp and principled." 
The two leaders discussed holding a "top-level meeting on resolving the conflict," and touched on Yeltsin's an­nouncement Tuesday that Russian troops were taking control of the railway and a narrow strip of Abkhazian coastline, Interfax reported. 
The conflict, in which hun­dreds have died over the past few months, threatened to worsen as opposing forces con­centrated around the Abk­hazian capital of Sukhumi, a coastal resort town of 150,000. It was captured by Georgian

Perot target of Vietnam 
WASHINGTON-Ross Perot told a Senate panel that the FBI warned him of an assassination plot against him by North Vietnam in 1970 involving Black Panther hitmen because of his efforts on behalf of POWs, according to testi­mony released Wednesday. Perot also said that in 1986, then-Vice President Bush asked him to pay $4.2 million for a videotape purporting to show live POWs and promised that the federal government would reimburse him. 
Poll: Perot behind in Texas 
HOUSTON-Ross Perot's presi­dential campaign got off to a weak start in his home state, with a poll showing 14 percent of likely voters supporting the Dallas businessman, compared with 40 percent for President Bush and 35 percent for Bill Clinton. 
Student poll: Bush leading 
MIDDLETOWN, Conn. -Forget the polls showing Bill Clinton ahead in the race for the White House. A student newspaper that has picked the winner in every election since 1956 weighed in Wednesday with good news for President Bush. Bush was the choice of 55 percent of the more than 600,000 students surveyed in the Weekly Reader, drawing especially heavy support among those in kindergarten through fourth grade, said Editor-in-Chief Sandra Maccarone. 


Bush campaign predicts farm vote deciding factor 
WASHINGTON -Suddenly, the farm vote is looking like a crucial factor in this year's presidential campaign. 
Farmers haven't always had so much clout in this campaign; only recently were farm issues discussed in more than passing by President Bush or Democrat Bill Clinton. 
But both campaigns now agree that growers could help decide the race in some of the key toss-up states. Some say farmers could even tip the election. 
"Both campaigns are just waking up to the farm vote and ·farmers' needs," says Mike Dunn of the National Farmers Union. "They're looking for every vote they can, and the rural vote suddenly looms very important. Here you've got a block of folks that could have a real impact in these states." 
Clayton Yeutter, Bush's deputy cam­paign manager, agreed. 
"The farm vote may decide this elec­tion," Yeutter predicted Tuesday in an­nouncing a coalition of more than 300 farmers, agribusiness owners and rural leaders who support the president. 
Yeutter said several farm states ringing the Great Lakes are especially critical to Bush's chances of holding on to the White House. And the farm vote in Texas, one of the biggest electoral prizes, will be a factor. 
Democrats also see the farm and rural vote being potentially decisive in some of the important swing states, said Miles Goggans, director of Farmers & Ranchers '92, an independent committee of farm leaders that supports Clinton. 
Quayle visits farm on tour 

FRESNO Calif. (AP) -Vice President Dan Quayle told California farmers Wednesday that if Bill Clinton and AI Gore are elected, "you can say goodbye to water, goodbye to food, goodbye to your job." 
Quayle, winding up a three-day Cali­fornia swing, said President Bush would veto any legislation that would strip too much water from California farms. 
He said Bush opposes legislation pending in the Senate that would re­quire shifting more water from Cali­fornia agriculture to protecting habitat for fish and wildlife. 
The Republicans are trailing far be­hind Clinton and Gore in California, the biggest electoral prize with 54 of the 270 votes needed for victory. 





Democrats encourage blacks to vote in election 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The Democrats, betting that Bill Clinton will benefit from a higher black turnout, announced a bus tour Wednesday to encourage blacks to vote. 
Black Americans make up an estimated 11 percent of the national electorate, but only 51 percent voted in 1988 compared to 59 percent of whites. 
The voter turnout effort, which begins Monday, follows a campaign led by Jesse Jackson to add more blacks to the regis­tration books. Black Southern lawmakers also have urged the Arkansas governor to more aggressively court black voters. 
Democratic Party chairman Ronald Brown said at a news conference that Clinton would appear at two stops on the five-day tour, an opening day rally in Charlotte, N.C., an,d a closing rally in New Orleans. Tour stops are also scheduled in Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi. 
Clinton and running mate AI Gore have focused much of their attention on "Reagan Democrats"-the relatively conservative, white, working-class voters who abandoned the Democrats in the last three presidential campaigns. As a result, Clinton has been accused of ignoring blacks, among the Democratic party's most loyal constituencies. 
"I know that criticism has been made," Brown said. "It happens not to be true." 
He said the party must "get back some of those Democrats who have deserted the party. I think it's a pragmatic common-sense strategy which helps us to get to where we want to get."

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Guard alumnus remembers 'traditions' differently than recent Guardsmen 
Dear Editor: 
One thing that time teaches is that there are at least two ver­sions of Notre Dame--what a student experiences during his/her short time as a student and the longer continuum of events and traditions which happen over the decades. The two can become confused when a current student believes, for reasons no stronger than hearsay, that something "has always been that way" and is, therefore, a tradition. 
In his letter (the Observer, Sept. 29, 1992), Mike Maier, formerly a member of the Irish Guard, tells of his pride when a Guard Alumnus of 1962 is "elated to see that the traditions have continued." I believe Maier, and many other Guardsmen of recent years, have been misled by an attitude (which seems to have developed and grown since the mid­seventies) that the Irish Guard has some sort of elevated status independent of the Marching Band. 
Maier never once mentioned the band in his letter, although he made several references to the fraternity of the Irish Guard. Forgotten somewhere is that the Band could get along fine without the Irish Guard, but the Guard is nothing with­out the Oldest Marching Band in America. 
Thirty years ago, the Band Director and the Captain of the Irish Guard selected new members jointly after the try­outs. There was no initiation of "rooks," no "traditional drink" either before or after perfor­mances, and nothing especially secretive about the business of the Guard. 

Father Tyson had no fears of our becoming "a subculture," and there was no need for an­nual meetings to warn the Guard about unacceptable be­havior. Perhaps we could return to these traditions. 
Many older Guardsmen had hoped that the 1987 incident would eliminate the artificial autonomy of the Irish Guard. Professor O'Hara has done us all a service if she can make this message stick: The Irish Guard and the Marching Band serve to bring honor to the University; only someone who is unacceptably self-centered would see it the other way around.

'Destroying life' is more rude than interrupting 
Dear Editor: 
I am writing in response to those letters that criticized the pro-lifers who heckled Bill Clin­ton. I was one of those protesters, and I do not apolo­gize to anyone for my actions. 
Some people believe it was rude to heckle Bill Clinton. I agree. To interrupt somebody while he is giving a speech is very rude, but I feel it is also rude to interrupt somebody's life by destroying it. Tem­porarily interrupting some­body's speech means nothing to me when compared to per­manently ending someone's life. 
What if a politician was advo-
DOONESBURY 
eating the legalization of rape or slavery? I am sure he would be more than heckled during his speeches. You see, I feel abortion is even worse of an evil than rape or slavery, so for me, heckling Bill Clinton was no big deal. 
I do not want people to con­fuse politicians with mothers. How I approach a mother con­templating an abortion would be totally different from my ap­proach to a politician. In a lov­ing and caring manner, I would try to show the mother that life is beautiful and precious and that having a baby is a miraculous and glorious occa­sion. 

Having the opportunity to bring a life into this world is a unique and awesome experi­ence, and although she might be confused and frightened, she needs to make her decision based on love, not on fear. I would not heckle her, and I would not judge her. 
But, yes, I will heckle Bill Clinton and any other high au­thority who tells me that the killing of a people, the unborn, is a rational and legal thing to 
do.

-A's bash their way to 4-3 win to take series lead 
TORONTO (AP) -The Oak­land Athletics always manage to do things with flair at the SkyDome, don't they? 
Even without Jose Canseco hitting rocket shots, the A's still won with plenty of power Wednesday night. 
Mark McGwire and new Bash Brother Terry Steinbach hit consecutive home runs in the second inning, and Harold Baines led off the ninth with a drive into the second deck in right that gave the A's a 4-3 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 1 of the American League playoffs. 

Jack Morris and Dave Win­field, the two free agents that Toronto signed in the winter to help them win in October, did their jobs. 
Winfield, hounded by his horrible slump in the 1981 postseason, hit a solo home run in the sixth that made it 3-2, and doubled and scored the tying run in the eighth on John Olerud's two-out single. 
Morris, whose last appear­ance in the postseason pro­duced a 10-inning shutout in Game 7 of the World Series last year and earned him the MVP award, had not allowed a hit since the fourth inning before Baines connected. 
Baines singled in his first two at-bats, then won it when he hit Morris' second pitch of the ninth inning into the stands. 
"It was a slider up over the plate," Baines said. "I was try­ing to drive it well. I don't con­sider myself a great home run hitter, but it was a great time to hit one." 
Dave Stewart went 7 2-3 in­nings and maintained his repu­tation as a big-game pitcher, and Dennis Eckersley enhanced his status by pitching the ninth for a save. 
The A's won their seventh straight playoff game, a streak that dates back to 1989, when they wiped out Toronto in five games. 
Toronto will try to even the series Thursday night when David Cone pitches against Mike Moore. 
"Everybody has kind of writ­ten us off," Steinbach said. "But our attitude all year has been kind of, 'Let's play ball.' Now we have a big game tomorrow. We have a real tough pitcher going against us in David Cone."

CAMPUS MoosrRY... 

. .... CoNSIDERA'IIONS 
Perspective A series of campus events leads me to a consideration of the importance of perspective in our lives. 
The remarkably nice weather of the last few weeks seems to have given plenty of opportunities for the architecture students to sit around on the lawn during class hours and draw pictures of campus buildings. I expect that they are learning how important it is to consider perspective and viewpoint in their drawings if they ever hope to represent their subject as it really is. Things look very different depending upon where you are coming from. 
This week is Multicultural Week at Notre Dame. The premise is that to hold up and celebrate a variety of backgrounds and cultures within our community will deepen the educational experience for all of us. On Sunday it began with a celebration of praise in the LaFortune Ballroom. Hispanic trumpets and guitars, Hawaiian hula dancing, African~ American poetry and Islamic wisdom together called all the participants to a wider vision of faith and a deeper respect for the variety of cultures. Throughout the week there has been music and food from an assortment of ethnic backgrounds on the Fieldhouse Mall and Fireside Chats on the 2nd floor of LaFortune. 
Unfortunately, it appears that from the perspective of most of our students, this is a very busy time, with plenty of papers and tests, and so these worthy events are underattended. Hopefully, by Friday night, the pressure will be off, and those not already booked up for an SYR somewhere will consider going over to Stepan Center and joining the closing event called "A Taste of Nations." Rumor has it that college students are fond of free food ~ so be there, or be square. 
Sunday's closing of the Sesquicentennial Year seemingly calls us to another perspective, that of gratitude and amazement for clear accomplishments over time. Years ago, there wasn't much here~ now there's a fine, big school. Years ago, the whole deal burned down~ faith and hope built it back up. Years ago, the project was placed under the patronage of the Blessed Mother, and the fruit of that decision is seen everywhere. May a prayerful liturgy and a joyful picnic renew us all and lead us to hope. 
Finally, on Monday, several special events may call us to perspective. First off, that day is the 50()lh anniversary of Columbus' arrival in the New World. For some it will be a celebration of courage and discovery; for others it will be a painful reminder of invasion and subjugation. It depends on your perspective. In Chicago thousands will march to celebrate the brave Italian sailor. At Notre Dame on Monday night, Amnesty International will sponsor a vigil on the Fieldhouse Mall to remember the plight of indigenous peoples, those victimized in the bloody past and those yet suffering around the world today. For the powerful, history is a series of stories about empires and conquests and victories in war. For too many of the common folk of too much of history, life is a challenge for survival while being between the agenda of assorted greedy warlords. The East Africans have a saying that "when two bull elephants fight, it's only the grass that suffers." Plenty of people from the slums of Panama to the sands of Somalia know the meaning of that proverb. 
The other anniversary to be celebrated this coming Monday may also ask for some appreciation of the perspective of those who suffer. October 12 is being called "Coming Out Day" for the gay and lesbian communities in the United States. We can imagine that in a variety of towns and university settings, there will be parades and speeches and self~ declarations. We can also imagine that at Notre Dame and St. Mary's there will probably not be much public activity at all. Maybe that's fine, maybe it's not. Some years ago, a couple of guys from a certain dorm declared themselves gay on a campus radio interview show and started a persecution of themselves and their entire dorm that really embarrassed everyone involved. What would happen nowadays, I'm just not sure. Some would likely be 
hostile, others would celebrate courage. But what is clear is that very little about our atmosphere will soften or grow until many more of us are willing and able to see life from the perspective of others, and particularly from the perspective of those who suffer the most. 
Perspective is one of the tools architects use to create new buildings; may it be one of the tools we all can use to create a newness of life.

Despite the efforts of Notre Dame senior co-captains Joe Dennen (223) and 1991 medalist Chris Dayton (232), the Irish were unable to make up the deficit. The Musketeers were able to clinch an eleven stroke victory. Detroit-Mercy was only seven shots behind after the first two rounds, but fell off the pace in the third round to finish 28 shots back in third place. Butler finished fourth followed by Dayton, La Salle, Loyola, Evansville and Duquesne. 
Xavier coach Doug Steiner was happy with his team's performance. 
''I'm real proud of David von Haefen. He had a good first nine today and when he started to have trouble on the back nine, he kept his head and still finished strong," said Steiner. The junior carded a two-under­par 34 on the front nine, then dropped four strokes on the first three holes of the back nine. He regrouped to par five of the last six holes. 
Steiner was also proud of the performance by Jon Sweeten. 
"Last year, Jon Sweeten was close to the last player on our team. He averages about 84 per round. This year, his average is closer to 7 4. It is a real tribute to his hard work and determination."

ger at specific players (something Mike Ditka has yet to learn.) A coach must shoul­der the blame for his team when a loss occurs. Holtz has taken the responsibility for the loss and for the tie with Michi­gan when it really wasn't en­tirely his fault. 
The Notre Dame faithful and the press have overlooked the real reason's the Irish are 3-1­
1. They are satisfied with laying all the blame on Holtz. and the Irish coach is feeling the effects. 
Holtz has stated he wants to end his career here. He wants to coach as long as he still en­joys coaching. With the obvious increase in pressure on Holtz this year, the question must be raised as to what is too much. When will he stop loving coaching? 
Those questions should make Irish fans reach for their Lou rags to wipe the sweat from their foreheads. If the pressure on Holtz continues, Notre Dame better hope that the Lou mask can lead them in the years to come, because the real thing will be gone.

Paterno a nemesis of Miami 
STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -­Twenty-five years ago, a skinny, second-year coach with thick­rimmed glasses earned the first major victory when Penn State beat favored Miami in the Orange Bowl. 
That young coach was Joe Pa­terno, whose team plays Miami again on Saturday. The last three times the Nittany Lions and Hurricanes have played, the result had a direct impact on the national championship. 
Saturday's game should be no different. The Hurricanes (4-0) are ranked second, the Nittany Lions (5-0) seventh. 
"Anybody who plays college football and doesn't look for­ward to playing a game against a team as good as Miami shouldn't be in the game," Penn State coach Joe Paterno said. "I shouldn't be in coaching if I wasn't looking forward to this." 
Penn State and Miami have played 10 times, nine with Pa­terno coaching the Nittany Lions. The most famous matchup is the 1987 Fiesta Bowl showdown for the na­tional championship, which Penn State won, 14-10. 

But in 1981, Miami beat then­No. 1 Penn State, 17-14, help­ing boost the Hurricanes to the near-complete dominance of college football they have en­joyed since. 
The Hurricanes beat the Lions last year 26-20 on the way to their fourth title in nine years. If Penn State hopes to be the Miami of the future, they must beat the Hurricanes on Satur­day. 
"We took a tough one last year," wide receiver O.J. Mc­Duffie said. "We felt afterward that we should have won the game. It's been a bad taste in everybody's mouth since then." 
In 1967, it was a victory over Miami that propelled the Lions to their most successful period. 
Paterno began coaching in 1966, but his team's five victo­ries that year came against Maryland, Boston College, West Virginia, California and Pitt. 
It wasn't until the second game of the 1967 season that Paterno won against a well­established team. It came against Miami, which finished 1966 ranked ninth and opened the 1967 season No. 8 in the preseason poll. 
Both teams entered the game with 0-1 records, but Penn State had to leave three defen­sive starters at home because of injuries. The Lions --11-point underdogs --started six sophomores on defense. 
"Penn State, which will open its home season against na­tionally ranked UCLA one week from tomorrow, will not be at full strength for Coach Charlie Tate's Hurricanes, whose name appeared among the top echelon in pre-season polls," the Centre Daily Times news­paper of State College reported the day of the game. 
The next morning, after a 17­8 victory, the paper's headline read "Teen-Agers Ambush Mi­ami." 
That year's sophomores lost only one more game in their college careers --the UCLA game the next week. The Lions were 30-0-1 before losing to Colorado in 1970. 
Irish hockey nabs home radio contract 
WNDU-AM 1490 will be the radio voice of Notre Dame Hockey this winter as the Irish take to the ice in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, the University and WNDU have announced. 
Chuck Freeby will call the ac­tion for the Irish, as WNDU tentatively plans to broadcast all 14 home games beginning with the Oct. 30-31 matchup with the defending NCAA champions, the Lake Superior State Lakers. 
Freeby covered Irish hockey as a Notre Dame student from 1982-86. "I'm excited to be a part of Notre Dame hockey and the CCHA," said Free by. 

"We are already enjoying the benefits of joining the CCHA, and this is just another step that shows the commitment to hockey at Notre Dame," said sixth-year head coach Ric Schafer. "Within our commu­nity and within our recruiting realm, people have taken notice that Notre Dame has recommitted itself to hockey. WNDU's broadcasts are a great addition to the program. It's further testimony that the hockey program is taken very seriously by the athletic de­partment."

BP romp heads interhall action 

By HEATHER WILEY 
Sports Writer 
Breen-Phillips defeated Lyons Sunday night 12-6 to preserve their undefeated record this season. Michelle Hurst had a strong night, scoring a touch­down on BP's second possession and again in the second half. Lyons also had a strong night and were able to move the ball well throughout the game. 
"I was really impressed by Lyons. They were a much-im­proved team than we've seen in the past and their defense played really tough," said BP captain Darcy Mehling. "It was a good game." 
Hurst also had another key play, when on a fourth and twelve she broke for a thirty­yard gain and a BP first down, setting up the drive for the game-winning touchdown. 
Lyons next game will be against Pangborn on Sunday at 8 p.m. while BP will have a bye. 
Badin 6 Off-Campus 0 
Badin defeated the Off-Cam­pus team Sunday by sending Andrea Ricker into the endzone with a center-sneak play that proved to be the only score of the game. Both teams stood out with strong defense and both were able to move the ball pretty well throughout the game. Shelly Dillenburger had two interceptions for Badin's defense, which was especially

Walsh defeated a determined Pangborn team in a close game Sunday night. The score at the half put Walsh in the lead with a touchdown, but Pangborn~ team caught up quickly to give Walsh a run for her money, scoring two touchdowns in the last nine minutes of play. 
"It got close. They (Pangborn) had a good comeback, but we managed to pull it off," said Walsh captain Laura LaVigne who turned in a touchdown of her own from an interception in the second half. Yvonne McCray and Terry Castelucci also had strong offensive games with a touchdown apiece.

Branstetter paces SMC volleyball 
By JENNIFER GUSTAFSON Sports Writer 
Every team has one. The kind of player who silently leads the team, both through talent and a positive attitude, yet receives little recognition. 
Junior Kim Branstetter is that player for the Saint Mary's vol­leyball team. 
She has stepped up as a ma­jor force in helping the Belles to a 13-8 record at the midway point of the season. 
According to coach Julie Schroeder-Biek, Branstetter is a very valuable player. 
"I don't know if she knows how valuable she is," she stated. 
Schroeder-Biek described Branstetter as a good all­around player. 
"Kim is a steady force on the offense, but defense is definitely her best contribution. We can

always count on her for the dig," she said, "She was not nationally ranked on this re­port, but she will be on the next." 
Although her passing has al­ways been good, Schroeder­Biek noted that it continues to get better, as does her defense. 
Serving is another one of Branstetter's strengths. She has been called upon as first server each game and has been very consistent in winning points for the Belles. This is essential in getting the team into the game. 
Kim also contributes through her attitude. By being up for every game, she spreads en­thusiasm throughout the team. 
"I try to be someone that ev­eryone can depend on to keep them up and excited," She said. 
Team success has always been her primary focus. 
"It is not one person that makes the difference, but all six, " She pointed out, "When we win, everyone deserves recognition. We win as a team and lose as a team." 
Branstetter, as well as the 
rest of the team will have to perform at top level for the re­mainder of the season if they are to receive a national bid. According to Branstetter, they must play well every game. 
"We can't give up any games, we must be undefeated for the remainder of the season," she said, "It is important that we have good stats." 
Statistically, the Belles are performing at a national level. On the latest report, the Belles were ranked second in hitting percentage (.310), ninth in kills per game (12.12), and fourth in digs per game (22.44). 
Schroeder-Biek feels that the possibility of a bid is there, but time is running out quickly. 
This weekend will prove to be crucial in determining post­season play as the Belles play host to Illinois Benedictine Col­lege and Kalamazoo College, both of whom participated in the national tournament last season. 
Schroeder-Biek hopes that the Belles will be able to improve on earlier tournament play this weekend. 
"We have performed well in tournaments this year, but we haven't been able to pull them out like we should have," she said. 
The Belles lost in the semi-fi­nals at their Kalamazoo tour­nament earlier this season after obtaining a number one seed. 
The opposite was true of their Baldwin-Wallace tournament, where they got off to a slow start and then finished well. 
The Belles hope to enter this weekend on a winning note as they play host to the Britons of Albion College tonight. 
The two met this weekend at the Wheaton College tourna­ment. Although the Belles fin­ished a disappointing seventh, they were able to easily hold off the Brits 15-5, 15-5.

Great Night for Notre Dame soccer
DOHRMANN 

Women crush 
The Jock Strip 

visiting Loyola 
t---------------1 By GEORGE DOHRMANN 
Strain on Lou mounts as losses multiply 
I noticed something different about 
my parents when they departed last 
Sunday from their Parent's Weekend 
experience. 
Gone were the Notre Dame 
sweatshirts, hats, golf balls, etc. which 
normally filled my parents arms and 
suitcases, replaced by something which 
I now find a little scary: Lou Holtz 
paraphernalia. 
Lou rags, Lou masks, and The Shirt featuring our esteemed coach, were the souvenirs of choice last weekend. Everywhere I turn the name or face of Notre Dame's coach is plastered to some wall or promoting something, and it is affecting my sanity. 
I can no longer bow to the coach at the end of the third quarter or after he makes a great call. When I drive by Bridget's, I have to look the other way to avoid seeing the "We Love Lou" sign pasted atop the front door. In fact, I can't even call my aunt Louise anymore because of the spelling of her name. 
I see a vision of Holtz in everything. I have difficulty watching The Simpsons because I think Mr. Burns is Lou. Every time I see Ross Perot I think he's going to start discussing the inconsistency of the Irish defense. 
The reason Holtz has encompassed all of my thoughts is that I am scared. I am scared that Notre Dame will be without its esteemed coach in the near future. 
None of us can imagine the pressure Holtz is under, and it can't help the cause when the fans and students of Notre Dame treat him like a God. After 10,000 students bow to you at the start of the fourth quarter, how can a coach live with himself after making a mistake. 
Throw on top of that the countless charities and causes and now the wave of Lou-like products and it may be too much of Lou for Notre Dame's coach to handle. 
Each year it seems like there is a new rumor about Holtz leaving Notre Dame. In the past, those rumors have mostly centered around open pro jobs, but now those rumors may whisper another possibility, retirement. 
After only five games, Holtz has been blitzed with more questions concerning his decision-making than in the six previous seasons. The Lou masks won't show it, but there is a hint of stress showing on Holtz these days, and it could have a frightening result. 
Holtz spends most of his time in the off-season playing golf and lying under the sun in Florida. He has said he will one day retire there, a day which could be sooner than thought. 
His love for football and for coaching has been evident in past years, but not this year. The typical sayings like, "Life goes on," and "You have to overcome adversity," are still there, but the emotion behind the words isn't. 
I listened as the students and fans chastised Holtz for his decisions in the loss to Stanford. The truth is that a

Notre Dame women's 
soccer coach Chris Petrucelli 
thought last night's game 
against Loyola would be an 
easy one, and he was right. 
The 15th-ranked Irish 
scored eleven goals, and held 
the Ramblers· to only one 
shot, raising their record to 
6-4-1. 

The scorers sheet looked like a novel, with all but one of Notre Dame's players seeing action, and seven different names in the scoring column. 
Freshman Michelle McCarthy started the scoring, turning a perfect pass from Jodi Hartwig into a 1-0 Notre Dame advantage. McCarthy didn't stop there, the forward scored the next two Irish goals, completing her hat trick. 
Fellow freshman Rosella Guerrero followed McCarthy's lead, raising the score to 4-0 after beating Loyola goalie Karen Butler. Guerrero's goal was followed by scoring shots from Gennifer Kwiatkowski and Stephanie Porter to heighten the halftime score to 6-0. 
The Notre Dame defense didn't have much to fend off in the first half. The Rambler's ·got their only shot of the game late in the opening period, forcing Irish goalie Kim Gold to make the only save of the game. 
The second half was more of the same. Margaret Jarc, Robin Mego, Tasha Strawbridge and Tania Macioce all put shots in the net. The Irish ball movement and speed was too much for the Rambler defense to handle. 
The best example came at the 68:24 mark in the game, when Mego weaved through

Men scrape by Detroit-Mercy 
By JASON KELLY Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's soc­cer team has been on luck's bad side for most of the 1992 season, and early in Wednes­day's 2-1 win over Detroit. it looked like they might stay there. 
The Titans took the lead at the 31:30 mark when senior Kevin Messing put a shot past Irish goalkeeper Bert Bader. 
Soon after Detroit jumped ahead, freshman Bill Lanza had two golden scoring opportunities taken away. Twice he broke away from the confusion in front of the net and sent shots toward an empty goal. And twice a ·Detroit defender sent the shots the other way as they 
neared the goal line.  
But  Notre  Dame's  luck  
would change.  
It was Lanza again,  on a  

play similar to his two missed chances, and this time he was able to put the ball in the back of the net at the 41 :07 mark. 
Sophomore Keith Carlson bounced a header past Detroit goalkeeper Jason Wood less than two minutes later to give the Irish a 2-1 lead. 
"I think things are starting to come together," Notre Dame coach Mike Berticelli said. "We played much better around the net and the defense also played better." 
Although all the scoring was done in the first half. the second half was not without excitement. 
Wood made some dazzling saves to keep Detroit in the game, and as time wound down those saves looked very important. 
In the final minutes, the Ti­tans had three good scoring opportunities. One went off the post. one went wide, and one went through Bader's

Eiler quietly leads Saint Mary's volleyball quest 
By MOYA SOMERSET 
Sports Writer 

After playing on the boy's high school soccer team in Festus, Missouri, Mandy Eiler knew that she wanted a college with a girl's soccer team. 
"I played all through high school. The teams varied. I played for one year on the Sain Pius boy's soccer team, the Coca-Cola Select team and other teams," attests Eiler. 
Eiler's athletic ability is not just confined to the soccer field, as she was also on the basketball, cross-country and softball teams in high school. But when she was considering Saint Mary's, she decided to stick with her favorite sport. 
However, soccer was not Saint Mary's only selling point for Eiler. "I went to a couple of classes and loved the school. One of the classes was an accounting class. Accounting is now my major," is getting used to her new role on the soccer team. "I was a little un­comfortable at first because I am not used to playing my new postition. I have played midfield my entire life and now I am playing stopper. Stopper is pretty much all defense," notes Eiler. 
Working with a new position and playing with a new group of players is the most challenging aspect of a position change for Eiler. 
"I have gotten used to it and I like the position now. I know what I am suppose to do and I am a lot more comfortable with this position," says Eiler, "I know the other defenders and how they play. We all cover for each other. I think we all work together really well. It just took a little bit of time to get used to." 
Despite her defensive sterling play this season, Eiler prefers having the spotlight on the team. "For the past two games we haven't done too well but we are still getting used to each other. I think that we have the potential to do very well. It is just the little things that we have to

"She works really hard. Once she gets in the game Mandy knows what to do and where to go with the ball. She is a solid dependable player," agrees forward Maura Sullivan. 
"What I try to contribute to the team is encouragement. I know that everybody out there is trying and people make mistakes," says Eiler, noting here propensity for boosting the team's morale, "I always try to say things like, 'good·try' and 'you'll get it next time'.
