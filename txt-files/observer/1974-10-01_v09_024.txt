by Gregg Bangs Staff Reporter 

Last Thursday between 1:00 and 3:00p.m., Bruce Petrovick and his roommates at 1256 East Sorin, had over $1000 of electrical appliances stolen. The following day, burglars carried off an additional $400 worth of their possessions within the space of twenty minutes. 
Petrovick joins the growing number of off-campus students whose homes have been burglarized. In little over a month, Director of Off-Campus Housing Father Thomas Tallarida has learned of over fifty-five burglaries. Four have involved losses of over $1000. 
Unlike most students who have been victimized, Petrovick, a senior from Norfolk, Me., took his problems to University officials. In a letter written to the Observer, Petrovick described the burglaries and urged campus officials to pressure civil authorities to find a solution to the rising crime rate. 
"Both of these robberies took place in the middle of the day while we wereat class, but yet not one neighbor saw or heard a thing," s_tated Petrovick. "On Thursday the burglars stacked the stereos, calculators, televisions and space heaters into a car," "but nobody saw the car, either," he lamented. 
"This is the fifth time in the last five months that this 
house has been robbed," said Petrovick. "Thus far, 
over $4000 worth of material" has been stolen." 
Petrovick's house has not been the only one hit by 
burglaries. The northeast side of town, has been the 
scene of other thefts. Glen Rimmer, who lives on 
Miner Street, a block from East Sorin, had $200 worth 
of stereo speakers stolen. 
Petrovick called up the South Bend Police after each 
robbery. "They sent over two uniformed officers who 
just asked questions and looked around," he claimed. 
"Then a detective came by on Saturday, just looked 
around, asked a few questions and said there was 
nothing he could do." 
The Detective Bureau of the South Bend Police 
acknowledged Petrovick's account of police action. 
"Our first move is to send a uniformed officer to the 
scene of the burglary," said Captain of Detectives 
Walter Benninghoff "The officer takes in the 
preliminary account of what happened, what's 
missing, and-or any description of suspects," Ben­
ninghoff continued. 
"We then send a detective to follow up on any 
possible leads that may have developed. However, 
most of the burglaries happen so quickly that nobody 
ever see any suspects, which leaves us with nowhere to 
start. Usually, we try to get the registration (or serial) 
numbers down," Benninghoff said. 
Benninghoff said most stolen material has serial 
numbers inscribed on it. The serial numbers of the 
stolen merchandise are fed into a computer run by the 
National Crime Information Center. If the stolen 
article turns up anywhere in the country, it can be 
traced back to where it was stolen or lost. This sytem of identification through serial numbers is known as Project Mark. 
Dean of Students John Macheca noted that the University aslo has a system of serial number identification. "We have a Project Hallmark on campus which works pretty well. Last year, a Lyons resident had a stolen television turn up in Atlanta," he said. 
However, this program does not help Petrovick and his roomates. "We remembered some of the registration nimbers but I don't know how good that's going to do us now," said Fedele Volpe, one of Petrovick's roomates. 
Other than "Project Mark," the only way students can be conpensated for their losses would be through insurance payments. Unfortunately, most insurance plans do not cover the types of losses incurred by Petrivick and his roomates. 
"Landlord's Insurance plans only cover their own property," said Fr. Tallarida. "I have heard about one landlord who offers students insurance and sells it to them, but I question the ethics of that situation. However, in almost all cases, the students have no coverage under landlord's plans." he added. 
Fr. Tallarida has given an evaluation of an insurance plan offered by a local private company to student government officials who had planned to use it. 
Petrovick said he heard about the student plan, but 
had not used it because everything had to be itemized. 
One of Petrivick's roomates was covered by his 
parents insurance plan, but Petrivick and Volpe were 
not. 

This house is the cite of last Thursday's burglary that netted over $1400 worth of goods. 
Captain Benninghoff thought that Petrovick and Volpe's situation was commonplace amoung college students. "Most students do not look into the insurance aspect of housing as much as they should," he claimed. 
"If they did, they would find that most landlords only carry fire insurance, if they carry any at all. The students are left to take responsibility for theirlosses," he commented. 
Tallarida is concerned about the responsibility of having to deal with this loss. "Even if the student is covered by an insurance plan, what is he going to do in the meantime?" he pondered. 
Petrovick feels that the situation can only get worse. "If we have 1 $1400 of electrical equipment stolen during the day, can you imagine what's going to happen during breaks? Every off-campus student should be worried about the safety of his possessions during vacations, " Petrovick emphasized. 
In his letter, Petrovick stated "I am positive that our case does not stand alone, for many students have known the situation well and many more will know it by the end of the year. I strongly urge all off-campus students to write or talk to Macheca, Burtchaell or Hesburgh to pressure civil authorities for a solution, because whatever steps are being taken now are totally insufficient. Off-campus students should have more to look forward to than getting ripped off." 
Petrovick has talked to Fr. Hesburgh, who in turn gave him the name of the University attorney. Hesburgh also advised him to "buy a dog!" 
Petrovick feels "the University owes more to off­campus students. 
"Ifa student is forced to move off-campus, and 1he is 
promptly burglarized, I feel the University should do 
something about it, " Petrovick stressed. "The South 
Bend authorities can't seem to do anything about the 
crime problem. Maybe the University can get 
something done. We deserve more than promises of a 
food co-op and a residence list," he added. 
Petrovick's calls for action have not gone unheeded. 
Tallerida, Macheca, and Benninghoff all have ex­
pressed concern over the rapidly growing off-campus 
crime rate. However, solutions to the problem are not 
as numerous as the complaints. 
Fr. Tallerida commented that the off-campus 
student is a "victim of his locality," and is more orless 
at the mercy of the area in which he lives. "I know the 
Northeast area has been having problems, but I'm not 
sure what to do about it," Tallerida stated. 
"I could close the northeast area off the residence 
list at the end ot this year, and eliminate the University 
from any responsibility to students who do choose to 
live there next year against our advice. But that would 
not serve any real purpose,"' rallarida continued. 
"There are some very good student resident 
facilities in the northeast area and to bar students 
from them would be a waste of good housing. It would 
also be bad public relations tn. single out that area and

Inlorlllation Services starts portable inlorl1JCJ1ion booth 
by Fred Herbst Stafl Reporter 

Director of Information Services Richard Conklin announced the inception of a portable information booth located at the circle. "This is the initial step to give better service to campus visitors," he stated. 
Sponsored by the Department of Information Services, the booth will be staffed by students of the work-study program. 
Conklin stated the need for three more students to operate the booth. 
Any student who is interested in working at the booth and qualifies under the work-study program should contact Conklin at his office in the Administration Building. 
The Director of Information Services hopes to have the booth in operation this weekend. The in­formation booth will be open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. every Saturday and Sunday until the weather turns colder. On day so home football games, the booh1 will be open from 9 a.m. until shortly before game time. 
The information booth will give directions to visitors, hand out campus maps and answer any general questions about the University that a visitory might ask. 
Stressing the need for such a service, Conklin said that before now "the University hasn't done much for the casual campus visitor during the aca:iemic year." 
However, the staff of the booth will not give campus tours. Tours may be arranged through the office of the Director of In­formation Services.

ND-SMCblood drive begins today 
by Mary Janca St. Mary's Editor 
The newly-{)rganized ND-SMC blood drive officially gets un­derway today as members of Stanford Hall volunteer to donate blood at the Central Blood Bank downtown. Cars to the blood bank will leave the main circle at 9, 10:30, 12, 1:30 and 3:00pm. 
Under a new system, blood mobiles which frequented the campus in the past and the blood drives in Stepan will no longer be necessary. Instead, each residence hall has been allotted one Tuesday or Thur!!day during the semester when its members may donate blood at the blood bank in South Bend. 
One reason for the change, ac­cording to ND:SMC Blood Council Chairmen John Famula and Robin Heisler is that, "Notre Dame and St. Mary's are part of the South Bend community,and as such, we <students) can serve that com­munity with a continuous supply of blood." 
In addition, continued Heisler, Notre Dame is a stepping stone for the national blood program in that it is "getting people to donate on a

Senate subcoll'DlJittee says 




Mar~.J~~~~ ~~:·w~~~~~.~~~~!~~~~~!.~~
WASHINGTON <UPI) Chairman James 0. Eastland of the Senate Internal Security subcommittee said Monday if the current rate of marijuana use continues, Americans mayfind themselves "saddled with a large population of semi-zombies." 
Eastland, in an introduction to a report of subcommittee hearings on marijuana, blamed the news media, in part, for the increase.

"If the cannabis epidemic continues to spread at the rate 
of the post-Berkeley penod population of semi-zombies -!f young people acutely afflicted by the amotivational syn­drome," he said. 

Eastland said it could bring a society "largely taken over by a 'marijuana culture' -a culture motivated by a desire to escape from reality and by a consuming lust for self-gratifi­cation, and lacking any higher moral guidance."
"The spread of the epidemic has been facilitated by the fact

inform them that their housing is not good," he stated. 
Macheca is presently meeting with city officials to discuss the problems of off-campus housing. "Last week I met with Pat Gallagher, the director of public safety in South Bend, and Kathy Cekanski, the assistant city at· torney, to talk about the vice squads. That does not have anything to do with this current problem, but next week, city and University Counsel Mr. Roemer, will join us in a meeting to deal with the off-campus houding crime rate," he explained. 
Tallarida is trying to refine the list of acceptable off-campus housing. "We're trying to get a history of the separate residences on the list. If we find a record of burglaries, we'll bring that out on the list," he commented. 
"Campus View apartments should also help alleviate the situation," Macheca continued. "With the increased number of housing units added to the residence list, we can drop the poorer units. It moreo or less follows the theory of natural supply imd demand. Hopefully, the choice of housing will getbetter," he commented. 

Although Bruce Petrovick's property loss is not the first in­curred by an off-campus resident, he is the first to publicly question the university's policy, or lack thereof, on off-campus burglaries. 
Macheca, Fr. Hesburgh, and Fr. Tallarida all expresse concern over the plight of victimized students, but there is no set policy which can deal with these matters. "I want to live off-campus," said Petrovick, . "but the university should help its students out."

The final university telephone directories will be avilabel by Tuesday, October 10, according to Richard Sullivan, University Registrar. This information hs been sent to the publisher, Promotional Enterprises, in In­dianapolis. Directories will be distributed as soon as they are received. 
The delay in publication, ac­cording to Sullivan, wil aiiow more accurate data to be compiled. 
Sullivan pointed out that, "the pblication of a preliminary directory, instituted two years ago, is designed to provide the extra time needed to gather the more accurate student data." 
Sullivan said his office was concerned with obtaining off­campus student actresses. This process delayed the sending of the final informmation.

Because this is Lyons' first year as a women's dorm, meetings were held to determine what for the government would tak.e. Section leaders were elected and gathered opinions from other residents. In this way, members tried to achieve the highest degree of participation. 
Resident Advisor Sally -Smith organized the meetings but did not direct them. "We wanted the hall to create its own image and spirit," she said. "This formation had to come from the girls themselves." 
Residents decided the structure of government found in the other halls would best serve the needs of Lyons. Although the philosophy of the government has not been discussed in detail, preliminary meetings revealed a desire for a greater community atmosphere in the hall.

October I, .1974. 


Wisdom 1n Silence 
What began as a light-hearted response to a comic strip, a humorous jest, has turned into a confrontation which has brought to the fore some of the most serious aspects of sexuality on this campus. 
What began as an attempt to cleverly define the characters of women and men has displayed blatantly our inability to express and relate to even the most basic elements of our own lives as human beings. 
The letters which have been printed in the Observer for the past week have gone from the ridiculous to the sublime-from the humorous to the obscene. It is quite apparent by now that the letters and the answers to them have done nothing but to increase the frustrations and hostilities which have so polarized the campus. They have served no constructive pur­pose. 
There is a strong indication here, then, that the co-educational atmosphere that is claimed by this University has proved inadequate. The expectations which greeted the coming of co-education now remain largely unfulfilled. 
The dominant sense is one of in­completeness, of something missing. The tone of the letters is one of people feeling cheated, persecuted, and searching for an enrichment of their lives which does not seem to be coming. 
It has been three years since the University of Notre Dame proclaimed itself a co-educational institution. In that lime, we have progressed from being an all-male campus to being a campus 
horribly divided  among  the  male  and  
female factions.  
The  building  of  our  co-educational  

institution has proven to be faulty in its very foundations. The carefully laid 

plans are beginning to show the areas where th(IJght and input were tran­sparent and glossed over. 
Why have w: failed to find a place where women ~nd men can face up to their identities, and confront each other in full and mature relationships without the sterotypes, labels and narrow, bigoted attitudes? 
When will co-education, in the true sense of the word, begin to fill in the frameworks that have been provided for its existence? When will admission procedures and female dorms do more than only create the presence of women on this campus? 
The time has come to search-not for solutions, for none can be found under the present atmosphere--but for an at­mosphere of openness and freedom. 
This atmosphere will not be found first in committees, in forums, even in small discussions among students. It shall first have to be found within. 
The first step to co-education, the step which has been ignored and forgotten, is for each member of the community to search within him or herself for the roots of attitudes of ignorance and misun­derstanding. 
The senseless, useless noise that has characterized the debate must cease. A period of silence is to be welcomt.d. A sense of calm rationality must r( place the violent emotionalism before any solution is to be found. Careful listening and consideration must rr-:place thoughtless harangues of glib opinion. 
Only without the bitterness and noise can each person here examine the inner attitudes and prejudices which have muddled the male-female situation. Only in such examination may we each, then, 
discover a wisdom that shall yeild a solution.

It was one of those coincidences that we all ·experience~ at times: a number of things happen in quick SUCCession With similar elements, and you wonder about possible connections. 
In the morning I had read a provocative and disturbing article 
about male violence; in the afternoon three women from Saint 
Mary's told the SLC of thier experiences during the "panty-raid" of 
S~ptember 9th; and then that night I picked up Time magazine 
and found the following lead-paragraph in the Behavior section: 
"In 1895, the pioneer crowd psychologist, Gustave LeBon wrote: 
'isolated, a man may be a cultivated individual; in a crowd, he is 
a barbarian."' 
The testimony from the Saint Mary's students was deeply up­
setting. They told of how girlsweredragged out of bed and thrown 
into showers, one girl suffering a head injury; they told of students 
being pulled out of windows, thrown down, grossed out with ex­
pletives, of which "bitch" was the .mildest They said the most 
terrifying thing of all was being treated as non-persons, objects 
upon whom young men vented disdain and abuse. They revealed 
that throughout the episode there was a disquieting absence of any 
sign of good humor ; they sensed instead a spirit of hostility. 
They admmitted, however, that it was not at all just a none-sided 
affair. There had been individual St. Mary's women who were 
guilty of taunting the N.D. students, daring them· on,)peningdoors 
for them, passing out beer. 
The article I referred to was by Dr. Eugene Bianchi, aprofessor 
of Emory University, and then it appears in the September 18th 
issue of Christain Century. Let me attempt to paraphrase some of 
his points.

The basic way by which the male in our culture establishes his 
sexual identi ty becomes a prime source of exaggerated aggression 
in the interpersonal, economic and political realms. The problem 
is : How are males in our society conditioned to value themselves 
themselves as persons? What are the criteria of self-worth and 
social acceptance among American men? The answers manifest a 
close relationship between violence and sexismm. 
In addition to influences from the American family, and our 
schools, which indoctrinate the young male with such a deadly 
serious spirit of competition whereby hostility and violence 
become tools for removing obstacles on the way to the top, the 
young male is greatly influenced by peer relationships. 
The middle-and upper-class male peer group becomes a milieu 
for sexist development. The assumption here is that inflicting pain 
will produce real men who get ahead; Witness, for instance, the rite 
of fraternity hazing, or the tendency to label draft resisters 
"faggots" because they refused to undergo pain as an introduction 
to manhood. There is a fear and passion that grow out of the 
cultural demand for potency in heterosexual performance. The 
young male, torn by doubts about his own sexual capacity, flees 
from the specter of homosexuality. The problem is not that many 
or most young men are quite naturally somewhat insecure 
sexually; rather, it is the domineering, violence-orintated sexuality 
that is advocated as a cure. The young man is encouraged to 
"score" with girls to "make" women. This is sexuality of 
conquest, of throphies to deck out his ego.
In a culture that is geared to aggressive attainment and that 
demands a kind of technological effficiency even in sex, many men 
are imbued with a fear of relating to women in sex as full equals. 
Afterall, if it's a questionof equals, there is no need for one to 
control the other or to succedd according to external prescriptions. 
The male mystique rejects the core ethos of the Judeo-Christain 
tradition. Justice, equality, and community -all the qualities that 
promote the common welfare -cannot exist side by side with 
proness to violence The gospel stresses the building of trusting,life­
supporting communities; the male mystique emphasizes in­
dividualist self-aggrandizement through domination of others. The 
Judeo-Christain ideal evolved toward an ethic of minimizing 
destructive aggression; the male mystique is geared toward overt 
and hidden violence. Until we see and deal with -these con­
tradictions, we will continue to harbor a false conscience that is 
psychologically and spiritually damaging. 
At root, malechauvinismis a denial of our co-humanity with others 
and a rejection of the (masculine) anim us and the (femine) 
anima that reside in every individual. But the oppressor is also the 
oppressed. The male mystique is the instrument of the male's 
bondage. It keeps him from relaizing his full personhood. How 
then can American men change the basic myth they have been 
taught to live by? How can thet begin to sense their self-worth 
according to another model-that of affectionate, nori-oominant , 
sharing person.
These are some of the points in Bianchi's article that struck me 
most forcefully. His comments may have absoluteiy no connection 
with whathappened at Saint Mary's. Still thy made me wonder; 
and wonder very seriously about myself -and the challenges to all 
of us, as we strivetogetherto become full persons.

Minutes of the monthly Notre Dame Chapter meeting of September 29, 1974. The meeting was opened with a prayer and a touching description of the Notre Dame­Purdue football game for the edification of those not present at the actual event. Attendance: all members in good standing present although two were forced to leave during the description of the above­mentioned game. Old Business: the minutes of the last chapter meeting were read and amended as to the improper use of a third conjugation plural subjunctive command. Correspondence: two letters were noted by the secretary. The first was from one B. Bear and was read aloud by the secretary. There followed a heated discussion among the members still present as to whether B. Bear was a private animal or representing his species in which case it would be the secretary's duty to answer the letter under provisions in the constitution for correspondence with learned societies. It was eventually moved, seconded, voted 
upon and carried that Professorin von der 
Vogelweide consider the letter a personal 
affront and answer it how ever she saw fit ­
within the bounds _of decorum. 
There on the cover of Harry Nilsson's new album Pussy Cats are Harry and the album's producer John Lennon portraitized as, well as, pussy cats-an ironic comment, no doubt, on the escapades of the two which included a much publicized night club brawl. A Lennon-Nilsson collaboration is the natural result of the past few years. It was Lennon's announcement in 1968 that Nilsson was the Beatles' favorite American songwriter that gave Harry his first bigboost. 
It is easy to understand the Beati.es' ad­miration. Anyone who can produce albums as varied and as brilliant as The Point, Nilsson Schmilsson, and A Touch of Sch­milsson in the Night deserves it. When rock critics list the best American songwriters working today they don't talk of Paul Simon or Bob Dylan but rather of people like Nilsson, Randy Newman and Jim Webb. But unlike Newman or Webb who work under the handicap of limited performing ability, Nilsson shines both in vocal and production work as well as songwriting. 
Itis with disappointment then that one has to report that Pussy Cats is not up to the hit standards of his Schmilsson lp's. This album, Nilsson's first containing original songs in two years, had a more uneven

You left your family and your home for you chose not to fight. 
Coward! Traitor! You turned your back! You took no part in bloodshed. by chuck kulig You will not share our blame 
for destroying lives and land. While we who went forth in freedom's name 
returned in sorrow and shame. 
Though uncertain of our cause, we held on to our beliefs. Never caring to question, never daring to object. Not for lack of courage, but /or de/eat our pride could not accept. 
Had every man stood up and said, "I do not choose to fight!": your sin would not have been a crime, 
instead, you would be right. Should we imprison you then, for Thinking differently? For you would surely be punished for your thoughts 
as well as for your act. You who dared to object. You who dared to follow your convictions. You are more a amn then those who boast to be. 
Come home, dear brother. Embrace your family, and be comforted once more. We shall put love in place of hate, and forget the tragedy of war. 

It was moved and seconded that the Society support Darby O'Gill as chairperson of the Bicentennial Committee for Preservation of the Notre Dame Ducks. The motion was declared out of order because the chapter had not yet finished with the correspondence. It was agreed, however, that a deputation of selected chapter members should be sent to ascertain if Darby O'Gill would be willing to serve in the above-mentioned capacity. The president of the chapter recommended that it be noted in the minutes that all present hoped he would. 
The second letter was then read by the secretary. It was moved, seconded, and carried that the letter should appear in the minutes in its entirety.

To the Notre Dame Chapter of the Royal Geophysical Society; 
Clyternestra von der Vogelweide, 
Secretary: 

Greetings, I make haste to correct certain errors that 
quality than its predecessors, which is brought on by what must be considered mistakes in judgment. 
Jim Cliff's "Many Rivers to Cross" open the album with a Nilsson tribute on parody of Lennon's vocal style. While the band (full of talented people ie. Starr, Voormann, Moon) chuns on in a Specterish Plastic Ono Band sound, Nilsson sings in that familiar style including a scream at the end lifted right out of "Mother" from Lennon's first lp. While this song works as imitation, I would like to hear it done straight. 
Parody may or may not be the intent of the song "Black Sails" originally written by Nilsson for a Peter Sellers' pirate movie. Here the string arrangement swells in a way that recalls the Schmilsson in the Night lp, while Harry sings, 
A treasutre map is hidden on your legs .. 
But you're so veiny 
you probably think this map 
belongs to you ... 

Nilsson describes this song as "zany, wacky, wonderful kind of yucko song ... a sort of blues blood ballad." Actually it does not equal past nutty novelties such as "Coconuts" or "Joy." 
As is his custom he includes several oldies. "Rock Around the Clock" moves furiously in the fifties tradition but fails to 
have been foisted upon your membership ­notably upon your esteemed and learned secretary, Clyternestra von der Vogelweide <no doubt due to her endearing trait of childlike confidence -I refer the reader to page 195 of the Proceedings of the Berkely Dark Age Colloquia, 1953, and the description of the Snipe hunt held after the banquetl by the wretched Miss Gurnrns. The so-called Viking remains can be no later than 1475 according to my data and most probably represent the cod drying facilities of a fleet of Breton fishermen whose ac­tivities in the waters off the Northeast coasts of this continent during the fifteenth century are well documented. Perhaps if Miss Gumrns would spend a little less time with fancy techniques (typewriter erasers indeed!> and a little more time in pursuit of solid scholarship she might recognize this simple fact. There do exist authentic Viking remains on the Notre Dame campus but they are considerably to the south, in the area of the Memorial Library and faculty parking lot. The lakes mentioned in the Freydis Saga lay directly over the present football field -there were no lakes on the present sites but rather the area together with the entire south quad as far as the St. 
! ~ 
a review by john zy-gmunt I 
match the excitement of past Nilsson revivals as "At My Front Door". "Save the Last Dance for Me," which last surfaced in the DeFrancos' sticky bubblegurn version, it considerably slowed down here. It is excellently produced with Nilsson talking the last verse in counterpoint to his singing, something he hasn't tried since Aerial Ballet. The third OBG "Loop de loop" complete with children's chorus has a certain charm but I'm not sure that this is the sort of thing I want to hear Nilsson or anyone else doing. 
"Mucho Mundo," the new Lennon corn­position, has a beautiful melody reminding you of his later Beatles' work. Combined with Nilsson's version of "Mt. Elga" it proves to be very effective. 
Of the remaining Nilsson compositions "All My Life" moves jauntily through a list of the songs of the average rock star while "Old Forgotten Soldier" seems to lack the power his earlier vignettes have. 
The most moving, only truly brilliant song included in Nilsson's "Don't Forget Me" 
lilt. 
Ed's-Washington Hall line was given over to a miasmal swamp which the Norse inhabitants referred to as the "Fish Pond of the Goddess Helli" which would account for the Indian traditions concerning the fish in the present lakes. With all the burnt baked beans and undarned socks in the world it would seem that Mi:;;s Gumms could find something better to do than increase the sum total of man's ignorance. She could do a lot more good in the kitchen than messing around that lake -out of her depths in more ways than one. 
Very truly yours,

which perhaps owes its roots to Nilsson's own recent divorce. The dramatic string arrangement seems to counterpoint Nilsson's ironic almost humorous attitude: "I'll miss you when I'm !onley -I'll miss the alimony too." However, the last verse speaks in moving fashion of the emptiness that awaits them both. 
When we're older and full or cancer, It doesn't matter now Come on get happy. Cause nothing lasts forever But I will always love you. Then in the final ehorus the singers' emotions meet those sugested by the arrangement as Nils~.on sings painfully, "Don't forget me-you lrnow I'll think about you -let me know you'll think about me too." 
It is one of the more memorable moments of Nilsson's career; a popular song moving in the direction of art form. It's style serves as a bridge between the old and the new Nilsson and promise1; much about his future.

LONG BEACH, Calif. <UPI)­Former President Richard Nixon "The -battery of tests which had will have to undergo further tests to be suspended because of the to determine future treatment for time needed to allow for propera lung blood clot which will require Heparin anticoagulation therapy is his hospitalization until the first of being reinstituted thi~ week." 
Previous statements had in­dicated Nixon's only visitors were his wife, Pat, and, early in the stay, his ·daughter Julia Eisenhower. 
It was revealed over the weekend that another visitor had been Cardinal Timothy Manning of Los Angeles Catholic Archdiocese. 
next week and possibly longer, it was disclosed Monday. 
Dr. John Lungron, his personal physician, issued a new medical bulletin indicating that Nixon would not be able to appear as a subpoened witness at the opening day sof the Watergate cover up trial which starts Tuesday. 
Nixon was said to be showmg "marked physical exhaustion," and only in the past few days able to get out of bed for portions of the day to sit in a reclining chair with his leg raised. 
"I am hopeful that all the tests will be performed and that the pre liminiary findings will permit finalization of his future treatment schedule by the first of next week," Lungren's bulletin said. 
When Nixon first enterea the hospital Sept. 23,_ Lungren estimated the stay might end by the middle or end of this week. 
The former chief executive is under court order from U.S. District Judge John Sirica to ap­pear as a witness both for the defense and prosecution at the trial of John Ehrlichman, H.R. Halderman, John Mitchell and two other former aides. 
The statement by Lungren is the first bulletin since last Friday, also said: 
"Former President Nixon's treatment is proceeding satisfactorily. 
"The intravenous ad­ministration of the anticoagulant Heparin has been discontinued. President Nixon now is being anticoagulated adequately by oran doses of Coumadin. He will con­tinue to receive Coumadin for anticoagulation for an in­determinate period of time.

CLASSIFIEID RDS
Freslunan Advisory O>uncil starts 
by Bob Mader Staff Reporter 

The Freshman Advisory Council, originally instituted two years ago by Emil T. Hofman , Dean of the Freshman Year, had its first meeting of the year on September 23. 
Dean Hofman sent a letter to the hall presidents on September 4 asking them to appoint a representative from their respective halls who would be "responsible, articulate, and service-minded.'' Dr. Hofman pointed out that it was necessary for the hall presidents to appoint the Council representatives, since the freshmen do not know each other well enough at the beginning of the year to hold an election. However, Dr. Hofman stated that Council members are asked each year for alternative suggestions for the selection of members'The 
functions of the Freshman Ad­visory Council, as outlined by Dean Hofman are: 
1 To provide feedback on general eonditions as they affect freshmen. 
Dr. Hofman commented that each representative is asked to set up a structure within the dorm so that the freshmen can let them know about the conditions which affect them, particularly academic. The first item of business at each meeting of the Council is to bring any problems of the freshmen to theattentionof the Council and Dr. Hofman. For example, if fresh­men in general are having problems with a certain professor, Dr. Hofman explained, the professor and perhaps the head of his department will be asked to meet with the Council so that any difficulties any be remedied. 
2. The second function, to report individual situations that are particularly good or bad for fresh­men. is more or less included in the first, Hofman said. 
:3. To evaluate plans considered for the future to the Freshman Year of Studies. Currently suggestions are being made by the Co~n_cil concerning a major revtston of the curriculum of the Freshman Year. 
4. 
To make recommendations for changes or new programs that will improve conditions for freshmen. One of the first projects for the Council will be an evaluation of the material sent to freshmen during the summer, the Academic Guide and information on the guidance testing program. Freshmen will also take part in setting up the breakfast for the parents weekend on the date of the Army game. 

5. 
To provide the opportunity to develop leadership within the class, Dr. Hofman said that he will preside over the meetings, par­ticularly the ones dealing with academics. However it will not b~ his responsibility to call the meetings. The chairman of the Council, who will be elected in the near future has the power to call a meeting at any time on any sub­


ject, man explained. 
Hofman said that the ef­fectiveness of the Council, as in any other organization, depends upon the members. Freshman two years ago initiated action which protects sophomores from the off-
