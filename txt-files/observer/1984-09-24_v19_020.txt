Assistant News Editor 
Since 197.2 when women were admitted to Notre Dame, there have been several areas which apparently did not adapt to the change. St. Mi­chael's Laundry is an example of a University service that does not seem to serve men and women equally. 
With each tuition bill; men are 
charged S'50 for a line of laundry 
credit to use during the semester. 
"Ibis fee covers a once a week laundry service. Anything over that S'50 is charged to the student's indi­vidual account. 
Women, however, do not have a laundry fee included in their bill. Any cleaning they bring to the Laundry is paid for with cash, or charged to an account they may open. Washing machines are pro­vided in each women's dorm for reg­ular use. 
Assistant Laundry Director Lupe Garcia said the service they offer to women is usually done on a small scale, and that the laundry would r·cally not be equipped to do wo­men's laundry on a larger scale. 
"Because all our laundry is washed together and handled in bulk, men's garments are easier to do," said Garcia. "Ladies garments usually have a lot of fancy, delicate 
items that could be ruined ifhandled 
in bulk." 
The Laundry does offer a dry cleaning service that both women and men can use, but students must 
Q d

use their individual accounts or pay cash. 
Laundry Director Norman Muller explained why a lack of facilities prohibit the laundry from opening up to women. "We have a problem sometimes handling the laundry of small in stature males because our shirt pressers are so big. With wo­men's clothing, we would need spe­cial equip ment for blouses and skirts that we don't have." 
Muller added, "We would need more personnel, more equip ment, and a bigger facility, to do laundry for women on the same basis as the males." 
Apparently, however, women do not mind the discrepancy. "When we went co-ed, the decision wao; made that women want to do their own laundry," said Vice President for Business Affairs Tom Mason. "We decided the laundry service the way it is now wasn't appropriate for what women want laundered." 
Two years ago, St. Michael's opened to women on the cash and student account basis. Ma'ion said discussions over the years with wo­men led him to believe they like the system the way it is now. 
"We have tried to respond to what needs are. We're open for discussion -ifwomen want it (the full laundry service), I don't sec any reason not to open it," added Mason. 
Apparently, however, women do not want any change. Susan Scott, a sophomorc in Walsh said she doesn't have any problems with the laundry service now. "I would rather do it myself actually," said Scott. "I haven't heard really good things about the way clothes return from there, and I like being able to do my own wash." 
The housekeeping staff gives the same treatment in its maid service, to males and females, according to Assistant Director of Building Services Gregory Miinch. 
"We don't give our maids special instructions whether they are working In a men or women's dorm," said Miinch. "The work Is not supposed to be any different."

A man who fatally shot one neighbor, wounded another and held off police for nine hours from a house was killed yesterday in a fire ignited by a tear gas canister, police said. Police exchanged shots with the gunman, whose name was not immedi­ately released, several times during the night before firing rounds of tear gas into the two-story, wooden house just before dawn, said Suffolk County, New York police Sgt. James Storz. The charred body of the gunman was found in an upstairs bathtub, said Sgt. Warren Grubner. The trouble began Saturday when the man began firing either a long-barreled rifle or shotgun for no apparent reason from his home, police said. -AP 
Eighteen people face charges in an alleged scheme in which an Illinois township official traded public assis­tance funds for sex with women who didn't qualify, authorities say. The 18 were indicted by a grand jury last week on charges including forgery, perjury, fraud and prostitution for involvement with former township supervisor David Lemke, who admitted trading rental aid for sex, said Warren County State's Attorney Warren McNeill. -AP 
China, the world's most populous country, had 1.024 billion people by the end of 1983, an increase of 16 million over 1982, the government said during the weekend. Wang Wei, the national family planning commission minister, said in a published report Saturday that population control "is not easy." But he did not say ifthe latest populationfigures exceed targets for China's strict birth control pro­gram.

Press overkill marks 1984 presidential campaign trail 

The 1984 presidential election is six weeks away, and the issue of Geraldine Ferraro's financial affairs is still making headlines. In a news conference with more than 200 reporters and 36 television cameras Ferraro ex­plained herself with polite, forthright answers. A defeated press cheered her. But the issue will not die. 
When the press is tired of Ferraro and her husband's tax returns it turns to another exploited issue of the campaign: the separation ofchurch and state. In report­ing this issue to the public, the press has blown it out of proportion and distorted it, perhaps beyond repair. 
First, the press reported that Ferraro had said the Catholic Church was flexible in its teaching on abor­tion. Then, the press rebounded with a report that Arch­bishop of New York John]. O'Connor had said the Democratic vice presidential candidate misunderstood the teaching of the Catholic Church. According to news sources, Ferraro cleared up 
this altercation with a phone cial advisors flock to New call to the Archbishop.

Few people will question that the separation of church and state is an impor­tant issue in the upcoming election. There seem to be ideological differences between the two leading candi­dates on this issue. But it is difficult to pin down either candidate because of cloudy news reports more con­cerned with incidents of conflict rather than the issue itself. 
The legal and moral status of a vice presidential nominee is also significant. What has she done that might disqualify her from the vice presidency? In all the scratching and digging the press has done it has dis­covered that one of Zaccaro's tenants (his company owns around two dozen buildings) is storing por­nographic materials in space in one ofthe buildings. The 
Philadelphia Inquirer revealed that Ferraro had received a contribution to one of her campaigns from someone described as an organized crime "figure." Ac­cording to New York Magazine another organized crime figure might have been a tenant in one of Zac­caro's buildings. Are these grounds for disqualification?

At least as important and potentially more dangerous than either of these election issues, is the issue of the press itself. The press transcends political parties. It provides all. classes ofsociety with reports and analyses ofcurrent happenings in the world and commentary on these events. 
Often the press is referred to as society's watchdog. However, in the past decade or so, it seems the press has broken its leash. Ever since the Pentagon Papers and Watergate the press has been gaining tremendous amounts of power. When 200 reporters along with ac­counting experts and finan­

On the positive side this means grabbing the late­breaking story, presenting more in-depth coverage and thoughtful analysis. It means digging for facts in the Woodward-and-Bernstein style. On the uglier side it means checking out every one ofZaccaro's tenants, and day after day filling front pages with stories of rifts be­tween Catholic politicians and the Church. 
The business ofnews is an explanation for press over­kill, but it is not an excuse. Obviously the press realizes the power it wields, but it must also realize the respon­sibility with which it must use that power. Unlike the different branches of government which are kept in check by the other branches and the voting public, the press must restrain itself. It must stick to reporting the issues, not creating them.

Women's caucus gives Mondale endorsement 
A.'i!!Odated Press 
WASHINGTON -Walter Mondale accused President Reagan yesterday of making "a cynical rewrite of his­tory" by Invoking the names of past Democratic presidents and the former vice president accepted the first-ever endorsement of the Na­tional Women's Political Caucus. 
In his weekly paid radio broad­ca.~t. Mondale urged Democratic voters to ignore Reagan's appeal to vote Republican on Election Day. 
Under a second Reagan term, Mondale said, there would be a "scary, intolerant, dangerous future. If you cross over to the Dallas Republicans, that's what you get. You don't just get the balloons, the pep rallies and the happy talk. You get (the Rev. Jerry) Falwell, Nicaragua and Star Wars, too." 
AI a news conference with Mondale at her side, Kathy Wilson, a Republican who chairs the women's caucus, said, "When It comes to wo­men, Walter Mondale stands tall. Ronald Reagan develops back prob­lems." 
The caucus ended 13 years of neutrality in presidential politics to endorse the first Democratic ticket ever to Include a woman, vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro. 
'Inc endorsement was announced just after Mondale recalled in his radio address that Reagan replaced a presidential portrait of Democrat Harry Truman with one of Calvin Coolidge in the White House Cabinet Room a few hours after taking office in 1981.

Polls indicate up to 2'5 percent of registered Democrats say they will vote for Reagan, but Mondale said he believes those defections are tempo­rary and will be recovered by Nov. 6. 
Reagan flew to New York to host a reception la.~t night in honor of the United Nations General Assembly, which he will address today. Also at the reception will be Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, sched­uled to meet Thursday with Mondale and Friday with Reagan. 
In announcing the caucus' en­dorsement of Mondale, Wilson said the decision was not "an anti­

Republican  endorsement.  It's  an  
anti-Reagan  Republican  endorse­ 
ment."  

The endorsement, decided at the group's meeting Saturday in Char· lotte, N.C., was made because there is such a sharp difference between Reagan and Mondale on the Equal Rights Amendment, abortion, federal support for child care, arms control, Supreme Court appoint­ments and economic equity for wo­men, she said. 

At a later news conference, Mondale said the bombing at the U.S. Embassy annex in Beirut on Thursday wa.~ "a very severe breach of essential security on the part of this administration." Following similar attacks over the la.o;t year, Mondale said recommendations for improving security were either ignored or delayed.

When asked of security arrange­ments for future home games, Terry replied, 'Right now, there are no plans for increa.'icd patrols.' 
It would seem that the lack of ar­rests came as no surprise to the Uni­versity. When contacted Friday afternoon, Sister jean Lenz, assistant vice-president for student affairs, said, 'We expect no student or stu­dent organization to organize a tail­gaiter.' 
All Notre Dame Football ticket holders received a notice with their tickets about the University's new al­cohol policy.

Those who decided to take part in the tailgating activities at Green Field were cautioned of the liability associated with serving al­cohol to minors in the state of In­diana. 
Fewer students were present at Green Field due to a lack of student­sponsored tailgaters, and the field was somewhat quieter as a result. Several groups, however, managed to celebrate the first home game in traditional Notre Dame style. Dillon 


Group therapy offered 
By DIANNE MCBRIEN 
News Staff 

For the student who finds that talking things_ out with a friend or roommate may not be enough, the Counseling and Psychological Services Center on the third floor of the Student Health Center offers a wide range of group services. Both discussion groups and workshops are available in the group services program. 
The weekly 1-1 1/2 hour workshops run for four to five weeks and are centered around themes such as stress management and in­terpersonal skills. 
Discussion groups are scheduled to fit the members' needs. Interested students should seek an interview with a staff member in order to de­termine if group therapy is right for them. 
Agroup for students who have ex­perienced the loss of a family mem­ber or friend is also available. 
The group services were and Keenan halls sponsored tail­gaters, attracting hundreds of stu­dents to eat and socialize. Other students chose to have private tall­gaters with small groups of friends or to attend pre-game parties with parents. 
Many commented on the lack of change from last year and the ease with which students could still ob­tain alcohol at tailgaters. Sophomore Scott Stephen noted, "I wa.~n't even aware that students would be fined for having alcohol. When so many students are participating, how much control can the University have over the situation?" 
Additional feelings were ex­pressed by many alumni. Dave Schmitz, class of 1984, stated, "There doesn't seem to be as much alcohol flowing. I think the Univer­sity succeeded in cutting alcohol back, but did not eliminate it." 
In general, the alumni seemed sympathetic to the University's con­cern over student consumption of alcohol. Several of the older alumni commented that the rules were much stricter when they attended Notre Dame. However, most alumni did not discourage student partici­pation at alumni-sponsored tail­gaters. As in years past, they did not hesitate to offer alcohol to students, regardless of age. 
developed because of studies and the success of similar programs on other campuses Indicated their value. "Research showed us that group therapy in a lot ofsituations is just as or more helpful than individ­ual treatment," said Luis Valdes, Out­reach and Consultation coordinator for Psych Services. "And within the last 1 5 or 20 years, group therapy has become a popular and effective mode of treatment." Valdes noted that group therapy was especially popular on college campuses, where academic and peer pressure, anx­iety, and loneliness are common. Many campuses have a program similar to this. 
Group services, which are available free of charge to all Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students, are entirely voluntary, Valdes empha­sized, "There's no coercion in­volved...it's totally up to the student." He also stressed that group services, like any other Psych Services treatment, is completely confidential by law.

New parking regulations are announced by these signs in the stadium parking lot. Due to the opening ofDecio Faculty Office Building and the construction behind the ACC, faculty and staff are using the lots previously used by students. (see story below) 


Parking lot complaints caused by Decio, pool 

By BARBARA STEVENS 
News Staff 

The opening ofDecio Faculty Hall and the construction of the swim­ming pool at the rear of the ACC have necessitated a reshuffling of parking spaces. 
The stadium lots are more crowded this year because many fac­ulty members who formerly parked in the faculty lots close to their offices in the library now park at the stadium in order to be closer to their new offices in Decio, and because construction of the pool has consumed staff parking behind the ACC. 
To compensate for the increased number of people parking at the stadium, the entire north half of the stadium parking lot has been desig­nated faculty/staff parking. In addi­tion, the number of spots in faculty and staff lots A-1 and B-1 (now jointly known as AB-1) have been in­creased by removing the obstacles to snow removal such as curbing

Some members ofthe faculty have complained that some days there are no spaces available in lot AB-1, but according to Glenn Terry, security director, there is always plenty of room in the back of AB-1 (the old B-1lot). 
To make up for the loss ofstudent parking at the stadium parking lot, students were given over 150 spaces in a lot marked D-1, between the University Club and Old Juniper Road. Signs noting the changes were posted September 10, but many people have continued to parkin the wrong place, and security has been issuing tickets. 
"The changes in parking allot· ment probably will be permanent," said Terry. "The pool takes up a lot of space, and Decio takes up a lot of space. I don't foresee any changes."

Students in Madras live in houses with kitchens and housekeeping staffs. During travel periods, "the group stays in fine hotels with both Indian and western cooking available," said Pullapilly. 
On the way to Madras, students visit Toyko, Hong Kong, China, Bangkok, and Nepal. Travel breaks during the semester are spent in southern India. At the end of the se­mester, the group travels to Bom­bay, Aurangabad, Jaipur, and Delhi. From there, students can choose to fly to Moscow or western Europe before returning to the U.S. 
Cost for the program is one se­mester's tuition, room and board at Saint Mary's, plus approximately $2500. This sum can be increased or reduced depending on changes in air fare, and hotel rates. The fee covers tuition, room and board at

Survivor of Beirut bombing says he Would return despite terrorism 
A."180Ciated Press 
IANDSHIHL, Wcst Germany-A 
li.S. Army scrgcant woundcd in thc bombing of thc U.S. Embassy in lkirut said yestcrday he would go hack cvcn though "it's hard to com· hat terrorism likc that." 
His commcnts wert: cchoed by embassy civilian employees ht:ing trt;Ht·d at a hospital in Israel. 
Staff Sgt. Terry Tcrrdl, :U, of Salt:m, Ind., suffercd head and chest injuries in the sukidc truck hom· bing attack Thursday on the U.S. Em· hassy annex in cast Ht:irut. At least ninc pcoplt: wert: kilkd, including two Amcrkan scrvkcmen. Tcrrell was one of 20 Americans among the 72 injured. 
Terrdl spoke to a dozcn reporters at thc U.S. Army hospital in Landstuhl, whcrc he was flown for trcatmtnt Saturday with dght other wounded. Asked by reporters about t·mhassy security, Terrell said, "If thcrc was enough protection I 
wouldfli be sitting here." 
Hc added, "They wcre doing all thcy could ... there's just not enough you can do about somcthing like that. Even if you put a IO·foot wall around there all they've got to do is fly a chopper in there and blow you up. It's hard to combat terrorism like that." 
Terrell said he would go hack to Beirut if asked. "I have no heartburn about going hack," he said. "That's the life ofa soldit:r." 
In lsrad, British-born Michael Mil· roy, a manager in the embassy's gen· cral services officc, said, "I would go hack immediately. I think there is a job still to he done and the United States should not leave Lebanon yet." 
Milroy, one of four wounded who was flown to Israel in two U.S. Navy helicopters ycsterday, spoke from his hospital bed at the Tel Hashomer Shcba medical center on the out· skirts ofTel Aviv. His chest, arms and face were badly cut and burned. 

Milroy said he was on the second floor ofthe embassy when the bomb went off. 
"Then I woke up on a hospital bed," he said. "I think the Americans did thc most thcy could to protect the embassy. But it is almost impossible to stop a suicide opera· tion." 
Philippines-born Robert Lora, an· other embassy civilian employee being treated in Israel for wounds, said he believed "the security was as good as it could have been. Some things were incomplete, but that was not signficant." 
An April 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy killed I 7 and an October 1983 attack on U.S. Marine headquarters in Beirut killed 24 l.A pro-Iranian, fundamentalist Shiite Moslem sect that calls itselfJihad Is· !ami -Islamic Holy War-claimed r sponsibility for all three attacks. 

West Germany's finance minister doubts talks will help Third World 

A."180Ciated Press 
WASHINGTON-West Germany's financc ministn warned poor countrit:s yestt·rday not to gct tht:ir hopcs up that special talks next spring on the world economic situa· tion will shape a solution to their $900 billion dcht problem. 
"We don't want to arousc spectac· ular, exaggerated cxpcctations," said (jt·rhard Stoltenberg, one ofoffi· cials from 22 countries who late Sat· urday adopted thc U.S. proposal for tht· global discussions at a meeting of the International Monetary Fund. 
"This is not the big conference on dcbt," Stoltenhcrg told reporters, apparently rl'ferring to pleas by in· dcbted Latin American countries for a high-lcvcl conference on the mon· etary crisis. 
Meanwhile, President Reagan met yesterday in Nt·w York with Raul AI· fonsin, president of the newly demo· cratic government in Argentina. 
That !iouth Amcrican nation is burdened with foreign loans ofsome S47 billion and for months ha~ been trying to work out a rescue package with the International Monetary Fund. 
In return for the help, the fund re· quires strict measures to try to restore these nations' economies to health. Alfonsin has been strongly resisting some of these steps. 
Finance ministers from around thc world gathered here for today's opening of the 39th annual meetings of the 147-member IMF and its sister agency, the World Bank. 
About two dozeq ministers took part in weekend policy meetings that discussed the outlook for the global economy and the continuing problems of the Third World. 
In general, most said they were heartened by the pickup in the world economy, led by the unex· pectedly strong upturn ln the United States. 
Ghulam Ishaq Khan, finance mini· ster of Pakistan, said economic growth is also beginning to be felt in the Third World.

United Mine Workers review offer 
Associated Press 
CHARLESTON, W.Va. -United Mine Workers local officers will get their first look at the union's pro· posed contract with the soft coal in· dustry at meetings around the coalfields today. 
The union has mailed summaries of the contract to members, but most local officials and the rank-and· file have yet to review the full con· tract. 
"Most ofthe ones I've talked to say it looks OK, at least from reading the summary," said Clifford Martin, a UMW field representative in Logan. "They're not looking at wages so much as keeping their jobs." 
District 17, the union's largest dis· trict, has scheduled its meeting today at 10 a.m. at the Madison Civic Center. 
After they review the agreement, the officers will explain the contract to the rank-and-file at local meetings tomorrow. Members then will have 48 hours to review the contract before the ratification vote, tentatively scheduled Thursday. 
The 40-month contract calls for a

of the agreement, meaning a top· scale miner would be making S I S.S7 an hour by the time the con· tract expires. It also provides protection for miners' jobs when companies sublease with non-union companies. 
The new contract also increases the number of paid inspections by union safety committees from four times to six times a year. 
"l'ye had a lot of miners stop by and talk about it," Martin said. "And they seem to be satisfied, at least with what they've seen. 
"There are two things that really caught their attention. They changed the language on subleasing, and that gives us good protection. lbey like that real good. And they like those extra safety inspections." 
Frank 'Iburman, who ran the UMW's political arm under former President Sam qmrch, said he wished the union leadership had sent the complete contract proposal to the rank-and-file sooner instead of issuing the summary.

Contempt for vandals 
The spray paint vandals that scarred the South Quad early yesterday mor­ning marked more than a few doorways or the base of the Sorin statue. The criminals have spit with contempt upon the community in which we live. 
This is not the work ofmerry pranksters, but rather some group who holds a deep grudge against Notre Dame. While it would be unjustified at this time to point fingers at anybody, it is necessary to express the disgust we all must have felt when we saw the buildings, home for many ofus, defaced with black spray paint. 
Whether the vandalism was the work of members ofPangborn Hall, as the paint on the doors ofAlumni Hall indicates, or some visitors in for the football weekend or whoever did it, this action should never have happened, and could have been prevented -but that is up to the security department. What we all have to deal with now is that somebody who would corrupt the beauti­ful residential South Quad probably would not think twice about walking into an unlocked dorm room to see what is lying around, or endangering Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students as they walk around the campuses late at night. 
Vandalism isn't supposed to happen here. And even though we have seen spray painted walls before, we haven't seen them at Notre Dame or Saint Mary's. There are injustices in our world -some far worse than this -but because this one happened to us, it hurts. 
If we can find out who did this foul deed, then they should be criminally prosecuted. But even if we never find out, the shudder we all experienced when we first saw the defacement will remind us that real life is sometimes chilling.

ALCOHOL POLICY ? WHAT,S -THAT? 


Hunger and inequality hurt North and South 
This year marks the tenth anniversary ofthe World Food Conference held in Rome in 1974. A major reason for holding that confer­ence was to respond to famine and drought conditions (particularly in Africa) which 
Bill Jordan 
guest column 

seemed completely om of control. It is diffi­cult to assess the success or failure ofinterna­tional efforts in this area because the issues surrounding hunger and starvation are so complex and the problems seem so distant from our own lives. 
On the one hand, certain areas ofthe world have seen some huge advances in the fight to feed themselves. India, for example, was con­sidered the most hopeless spot in the world twenty years ago. The problems of drought, underdevelopment and overpopulation seemed insurmountable, but food production has lately been on the rise in India. Poverty and underdevelopment are still acute prob­!ems there, but the example oflndia's increas­ing agriculture production shows us that international attention and aid on food issues is vitally important and can be successful. There is reason for optimism. 
On the other hand, it is obvious that the world hunger situation on a whole has deteriorated in the last ten years rather than moved forward. Progress is eclipsed by un­controlled population increases which are doubling populations in the Third World every twnety years while our own population level is remaining the same. 
I guess the question I would like to ask is, ­"What exactly will motivate us to do some­thing about these problems which seem so distant to us?" I believe Americans have a great quality they can be proud of; when they put their minds to doing something they can do it. At the same time we are pragmatic so I would like to make an argument that appeals to our sense ofpragmatism. 
One ofthe most interestingconclusions last semester's nuclear dilemma class came to in our final discussion concerned what our most prevalent fears were in the area of nuclear arms. There was an overriding consensus that our nation is not threatened as much by the Soviet Union as it is by Third World nations whose moralities justify terrorism. How would we respond to a terrorist attack with nuclear weapons? Even if a group, such as the Islamic Holy War ogrganization (who took credit for the latest U.S. embassy bombing in Beirut), took credit for a nuclear terrorist at­tack, how could we retaliate? By nuking the whole city ofBeirut (or nation of Lebanon for that matter)? It seems clear that the Soviet Union has respected the hard line foreign policy approach of our present administra­tion, bm I would argue that our policies in the Third World have nurtured more violent mentalities as we have been increasing the gap between rich and poor in our world. 
Vietnam might serve as a good example to learn by; we could not win that war because we could not find or understand the enemy. Students did not begin to protest the injustice of that situation until their friends started coming home in wooden boxes. That distant issue ofVietnam was brought home and con­cretely affected peoples' families before a stop to the war was demanded. Let us not wait any longer in dealing with the enemies to our sur­vival; namely poverty, hunger and starvation. Terrorist attacks are difficult to stop and knowledge of nuclear devices is proliferating beyond our control. 
In closing, I would like to quote a Brazilian terrorist named Ladislas Dowbor, who was in­terviewed by a French journalist Sanche de Gramont. Dowbor, a well educated man brought up under Catholic tutelage, morally justifies his use of violent terrorism: "My fa­ther invited me to a good restaurant and I refused. As a catholic, when you see children dying ofhunger, either you refuse a meal that could feed five children, or you abandon your Christianity... There was sufficient misery in Recife for morality not to exist...I had believed so strongly in the christian values I had practiced that I now had to replace them with something else equally valid." 
My argument is that hunger and the widen­ing inequality between North and South need to be dealt with...for our own best interest.

Without the right to life no one can be free 
Governor Cuomo courageously and elo­quently gave his justification for" his view that while he is personally opposed to abortion, he does not support legislation against abortion and indeed that he supports government fun­ding ofabortion. Both Cuomo and Father Res­burgh expressed their interest and eagerness to have an open discussion on this matter and to hear other points ofview. Here I would like 
Janet E. Smith 
guest column 

to explain why Cuomo's argument does not convince me, for I, too, am personally opposed to abortion but I think legislation is necessary and government funding is im­moral. Cuomo's argumentationpresents more difficulties than I am able to address here: due to space limitations I shall address only a few of the points which he made. 
Let me make short work of Cuomo's con­stant equation of birth control and abortion: he repeatedly stated that Catholics are not seeking laws or constitutional amendments against birth control; thus they should not be seeking the same for abortion. The difficulty with this agrument may best be exposed by noting that Catholics (and others) think glut­tony, pride, sloth, lust, drinking too much, etc. to be sins, but that we are not seeking .laws 
against them. We do seek laws against such sins as rape, and slavery, and genocide; the magnitude and nature of the sin determine whether we seek public sanction against it. Since Cuomo agrees that abortion is killing, he should recognize the faultiness of his equa­tion. 
Cuomo was courageous to take up the point of the parallel case of slavery. The argument made against him is that most ofus recoil from the phrase "I am personally opposed to slavery, but I would not impose my views on others". Those making this argument had hoped that Cuomo, too, would recoil from it and see that, thus, his view on abortion is un­tenable. 
Cuomo does not recoil from this statement and in fact attempts to turn the analogy to his benefit: he suggests that some good men at the time thought it imprudent to seek legislation against slavery then and that the situation with abortion is similar now. He rightly informs us that even Lincoln was willing to tolerate slavery in some states and to work in a gradual way to have it outlawed in other states. Lin­coln held this position, made this prudential judgment, because of the division and bloodshed which would most likely result were the laws to be changed suddenly. So too, Cuomo thinks abortion wrong, and presumably would like to see it outlaws· (though he never said this explicitly); he simply thinks that it is impractical, unrealistic, and divisive to push for legislation now. 
Let us examine the parallel as made by Cuomo. Although Lincoln may have been jus­tified, I have wondered how Lincoln would explain his action to slaves. Let us imagine Lin­coln addressing a group of slaves and justify­ing his position: "Slaves, I agree that your fundamental right to freedom is violated by the practice ofslavery but I think that it would be wrong to disturb the public peace in order that you might enjoy those rights. You see, some people think that black people do not deserve the same rights as all of us; I would like some time to convince them that you do. Let us work at this gradually, and perhaps in a few generations we may succeed in convinc­ing those who have voting rights to grant your emancipation. Presently I must simply uphold the law ofthe land which allows slavery." And if Lincoln reasoned like Cuomo he might add: "And furthermore, I believe that the poor and disadvantaged should not be deprived of the privilege ofthe rich so I am proposing the gov­ernment funds be used to provide slaves for the poor. I am sure you will understand my position." 
If it were possible for Gov. Cuomo to ad­dress the unborn, what would he say? "Hello, little ones! You, too, may play football some day at Notre Dame, if your mother does not have an abortion. I would like to help you be­cause I believe that you are human beings and that abortion is killing. I believe that you have 11 right to life but I feel it would be wrong to impose my views on those who do not agree with me. In fact, I will help your mother pay to have you killed because I know she would do it anyway and I would not like her to fall short on money for the rent. So, be patient, little ones; perhaps after several more millions of you are killed, we might be able to persuade the American public that you have the right to life and they will stop the killing." 
Perhaps Lincoln was right, perhaps blacks and their supported should have been more patient, perhaps it is right to allow the viola­tion of the fundamental rights of some in or­der to protect the peace of all. Certainly he gave witness to his opposition to slavery by frequently denouncing slavery. Cuomo would convince us better of his "personal opposi­tion" to abortion ifhe would speak out against it and try to get others to share his opposition. 
But is abortion a parallel case to slavery? Not quite, for here the fundamental right being violated is even more fundamental; it is not freedom but the right to life: without life, one cannot be free. And would a law against abortion be divisive in the same way that a law against slavery would have been? Would there be any bloodshed? Would there be bloodshed to match the bloodshed which we now have with over one million and a half abortions a year?

Sir Obnoxious returns 
by Marc Ramirez 
features columnist 

S
top. 
Stop whatever you arc doing and listen up. I don't care if you 
arc eating lunch, brushing your teeth, or giving birth to a baby. Stop 
right now, because it's true, and there's nothing you can do about 
H. 
Sir Obnoxious is back. 
Sir< >bnoxious realizes, ofcourse, that at the culmination oflast 
ycar·~ battle against Miss Manners (from which, Sir Obnoxious 
hastens to add, he emerged victorious), he vowed never to return 
to this desolate campus where rudeness and crudeness reigned 
free. 'Inert: was nothing more to be done here, or so Sir Obnoxious 
thought as both Administration and students pecked back and forth 
at each other with complete tactlessness. And Sir Obnoxious was 
proud. 
But while lounging in his six-bedroom house in Beverly Hills,'Sir 
Obnoxious became restless, and frequent visits from Ozzy ' 
<>sbournc were becoming too much ofa good thing. And then the 
~ad truth dawned upon Sir Obnoxious that even one year away 
from this place would dear the way for a tactful, polite, goody-two­
~hocs frt·shman class. 
So now Sir Obnoxious addresses the freshmen who continue to 
cxt·usc themselves after burping, those who still keep their dhows 
off the table, and those who don't watch Monty Python. 
Wi~e up, you little rugrats. Get a due. 
And listen to the wisdom ofSir Obnoxious, while turning a deaf 
t·ar to the preachings ofthat clueless bimbo Miss Manners. 
And now to the topic at hand. 
Sir Obnoxious wishes to address himsdftoday to the events 
which you call "pep rallh.:s." Pep rallies arc Sir Obnoxious' type of 
thing: a large gathering ofboisterous people given to screaming 
and shouting. In other words, they arc inherently obnoxious. Sir 
Obnoxious himself has attended a few such events and loved them. 
If ever any occasion gave opportunity to cry havoc and let loose 
the mutts ofobnoxiousness, it is the so-called pep rallie. 
Among the spectacles Sir Obnoxious has admired about these 
events have been flying rolls of toilet paper, hot and sweaty 
armpits, lots ofgood places for a "stick-up," and multitudes of 
broken promises. Last Friday, as a matter offact, 60 minutes ofgood 
football were promised in return for 60 minutes ofcrowd support. 
Sir Obnoxious saw a small chance for fun. He promised, and left the 
game at halftime. 
However, Sir Obnoxious by no means believes that pep rallies 
have reached their full potential as opportunities for the unleashing 
of rude and uncivil behavior. No, not by any means. On the 
contrary, Sir Obnoxious believes that there isalways room for 
improvement, a'i it were. 
And so Sir Obnoxious proposes the following: a pep rally 
sponsored by one entity, I.e. a dorm or campus club, which, while 
including all of the aforementioned discourtesies, would also be 
used as a method oflashing out at another entity, i.e. another dorm 
or campus club. 
Sound good? Imagine the possibilities. 
Just imagine a dorm holding its own pep rally, complete with 
music, loudspeakers and loud speakers, making lots and lots of 
noise on the quad as it posed under the guise 'or a spirited 
endorsement for the football team. Yes, be sure to include many 
cheers and rah-rah sorts ofspeeches, and also throw in some 
prominently located banners and signs. But then toss in the meaty 
stuff. What Sir Obnoxious means is that, a'i long as you've got the 
privilege ofamplified communication, and a'i long as you've got 
lots ofpeople listening to your every howl, why not take the ball 
and run with It? 
Yes, now you've got it. Do you hate the members ofthe Karate 
Club? Call them names over the microphone. Do you despise the 
workers in the dining hall? Make very obvious references to them 
on your banners. Do you enjoy poking fun at alumni? Incorporate 
the appropriate sentiments into your cheers. Get the whole crowd 
into it. Ifyou've got the voice, use it. Sir Obnoxious always does. 
Pep rallies of this sort would be the lowest form ofunsubtle 
tactlessness imaginable when utilized to their proper potential. Sir 
Obnoxious proposes such rallies to anyone and everyone who 
wishes to make Sir Obnoxious proud through manifestation of 
utter discourtesy and the exhibition ofabsolutely no class at all. 
Your Majesty Sir Obnoxious: 
Aht·m. You'lllikc this. I know you hate it when people read over your shoulder, and so I took the liberty ofdoing just that. Yeah, I did it, and now I got something to say. You ain't so special. No, and you know why? Because we thought ofit first. That's right, we had a pep rally just like the one you just wrote about, uh huh, we did it first. What do you think about that? 
A Dillon Animal OAmwying Remler: 
Sir Obnoxious apologizes for the oversight, and wants you to know that he is doubly proud ofyou. It took an enormous amount ofskill to rt·ad over Sir Obnoxious' cold shoulder without having your nost· turned inside out, and is glad to know that someone on this campus wa~ baseless en<?ugh to be thinking ahead ofSir ( >bnoxious himself. Congratulations on a job well done. 
Feding much too correct? Address all inquiries on the back of an olcl homeuork assignment in green or red ink to Sir Ob­noxious, in care ofIbis newspaper. Maybe he'll respond and maybe be won't. So there. Nyaab. 


Meet the Bollweevil family 
by Sam Moore 
features staff writer 
M
any people consider Flanner Hall, judging by its modern architecture, a symbol of the isola­tion of the modern age. They imag­ine Flanner as a cold, impersonal dorm where y_..1're lucky if some­one speaks to you. I decided to five at Flanner after a weekend stay during my senior year in high school. 
I reported to my room on the 7th floor on the Friday offreshman orientation. I met my roommate, and the other four freshmen that shared our six-man suite. Over the next few days we ventured out and met the other freshmen in the sec­tion. Once we had had a chance to adiust to classes, we attended our first section meeting at which the seniors were friendly, if not under­standably distant. This calm, predic­table, routine beginning in Flanner was no indication ofwhat was to come. 
As I didn't take Chemistry II5, I was sleeping soundly on Emil Eve, when suddenly, there was the dis­tinct odor ofbaby powder in the room. The upperclassmen were using a blow-dryer to blow the powder into our room. My roommate awoke, and tried to turn on the lights. When they didn't turn on, we realized our a'isailants had planned this attack carefully. An attempt to open the door would have also been in vain, it had been pennied shut. Perhaps that was for the best. I later found out that beyond that door were I 5 up­perclassmen armed with shaving cream and ready to fire on sight ofa freshman. Thus without too much difficulty, I had survived "Freshman Orientation" and earned the dis­
tinction ofbeing a Bollweevil. 
The origin of the Bollweevils was during the 1979-80 school year, when Paul Ocrenzi,'82, decided to kick off a section meeting with what came to be known as the joke: "What eats cotton and rides a motorcycle?--Evil Bollweevil." And thus, the birth of the Boll weevils. A member of this new breed would be a daring, intelligent, trustworthy, ath letic man, a noble example of the Notre Dame male. 
As the semester passed, the other freshmen and I progressed in our Bollweevil education. We became familiar with the Bollweevil joke, we awaited the Bollweevll Bowl (played against our rival section, 7 A) with ferocious determination, most importantly, we began to enjoy a sense ofunity, a bond that lasted through both the good times and the bad. This new unity meant that each Bollweevil got praise for doing well at something, consola­tion if a misfortune or tragedy struck, or abuse ifone dressed "weird". And back in the old days, when section parties were tolerated, we hosted ba'ihes. There we would drink, dance, embarrass ourselves at times and, after the bash, we would mello out and reminisce about our favorite mo­ments ofthe party. 
One of the highlights of the Bol­lweevil ye .. r was, and is, our raucous Christmas party. It's a semi­formal affair that features the legen­dary "Christmas play." This play features upperclassmen a'i they hilariously roast their fellow Bol­lweevils through theatre. Our guests, who come by invitation only, enjoy the revelry and a great time is had by all. 
life is change, and change hit the Bollweevils as hard as it does anyone. One Bollweevil graduated and a few others left the section for elsewhere. Nevertheless, sopho­
more year arnve<l, we changed locales and we had a new freshman group to train in Bollweevilism. This time, we were the ones wreak­ing havoc during "freshman orienta­tion". Again,-the same comradery developed, which in a year oftransl­tion and indecision, was a relieving constant. The freshmen brought a welcome diversity to the section, this balanced well with the tradi­tion provided by the elders, espe­cially Head Bollweevil Mark Primich,'84. 
A Bollweevil section meeting rivals "The David Letterman Show" for fun and entertainment. Usually held in the Red Room, named so because of the room's bright red carpet, the meeting opens with, of course, the section joke. Then, we proceed to such important issues as electing a new section leader. After the meeting ends, we might enjoy the cultured plea'iures ofan activity such a'i the section pile-on. 
Now it is my junior year. There are many differences between la'it year and this year. I propose that we measure years in terms of Before Policy ( B.P. ), and After Policy 
(A.P. ). In this year I A.P., the cocky sophomores of 1982-83 are now seniors 1.nd preparing for upcoming LSAT's, this year's sophomores have built a lounge to rival the Red Room, and this year's "freshman orientaticn" was too tame. But the Bollweevils carry on and will, indeed, m..Jst survive. A student's lifestyle should entail a minimum of lonliness. The Boll weevils are a family. Nothing more need describe us.

cable from the ceiling of the museum. His assistant would test fly the models around the museum. During one flight, the assistant had to put out his feet to prevent him­selffrom crashing into the wall. The next morning, Brother Benedict, the Science Hall curator, found the footprints high up on the wall. Brother Benedict decided that only the devil could walk along the wall. He immediately sprinkled the entire building with holy water to expurgate the "evil spirit." 
Albert Zahm's aerodynamic ex­ploits were not confined to the interior ofScience Hall. He launched the first man-carrying glider from the building's roof. The knowledge gained from his experi­ments contributed a great deal to the aeronautical science which later made the Wright Brothers' flight possible. 
The roofofScience Hall was also the site ofanother technological "first." In 1895 Dr.jerome}. Green became the first American to send a wireless message. The message was sent from the roofofScience Hall to Hoynes Hall at Saint Mary's College. 
Many students :ftld future scien­tific pioneers, includingjulius Nieuwland, the discoverer ofsyn­thetic rubber, were trained at Sci­ence Hall. Even as Science Hall played an important role at Notre Dame, eventually there became a need for greater scientific facilities than the Hall could provide_ In 1953 the Hall began a new chapter in its history when it wa'i con­verted, with the assistance ofan unrestricted gift from joseph A.

Chicago clinches tie for ' L ~ NL East division title 
A8soclated Press 
ST. LOUIS -Gary Matthews drove in five runs with a double and a homer yesterday as the Chicago Cubs clinched a tie for the National League East championship, their first tide ofany kind in 39 years -wi an 8-1, 4-2 double-header sweep of the St. Louis Cardinals. 
In the first game, Matthews' three­run double sparked a six-run fourth inning and Steve Trout scattered seven St. Louis hits. 
The Cubs entered the twinbill with a five-game losing streak,. They can wrap up the tide Monday night against·the Pittsburgh Pirates behind their ace right-hander, Rick Sutcliffe. 
Matthews' homer sent Chicago off to a flying start in the second game against Joaquin Andujar, 19-14. Bob Dernier reached first on shortstop Ozzie Smith's throwing error before Matthews homered. 
Singles by Ron Cey, Steve Lake and Larry Bowa made it 3-0 in the fourth. 
In the Cards' fifth, Darrell Porter singled, David Green doubled and Andujar hit an RBI grounder. In the sixth, Smith doubled and Andy Van Slyke singled to cut the Cubs' lead to 3-2. But Chicago added a run in the eighth on Dernier's double and Ryne Sandberg's single. 
Dennis Eckersly, 9-8, allowed six hits in seven innings and Lee Smith recorded his 33rd save for the Cubs. 
The Cubs erupted in the fourth in­ning of the opener after Rick Ownbey, 0-3, walked Dernier and Sandberg with one on in the fourth and the score tied 1-1. Jeff Lahti replaced Ownbey and Matthews doubled. After Leon Durham walked, Keith Moreland singled in one run and Cey doubled in the final two in the inning. 
The Cubs added a run in the sixth on Durham's single and Moreland's double off Kevin Hagen.

The 55 points scored Saturday is the most scored by the Irish since the 1977 season's 69-14 victory over Georgia Tech. 
"I think our football team is get­ting better, but It's going to take a lot ofhard work," said Faust. "I think the second half against Michigan State carried over to the way we played today. Now it's just a process of trying to improve each week." 
Today Notre Dame starts prepar­ing for its nationally televised game on Saturday at Missouri with newly found success and perhaps, some more confidence. 
A's 5, Royals 1 
KANSAS CilY, Mo. -Rickey Hen­derson singled, doubled and slammed a two-run homer yester­day, carrying the Oakland A's to a 5-1 victory over Kansas City and drop­ping the Royals into a first-place tie with Minnesota in the American League West. 
The Twins, who entered the day a game behind Kansas City, beat Cleveland 5-1. California, which lost 2-1 in 10 innings to Texas, remained in third place, 1% games behind. 
Chris Codiroli held the Royals to four hits until Bill Caudill relieved him in the seventh and finished up for his 34th save. The loser was Mike Jones, 2-3. 
Henderson also stole his 60th base of the season and scored two runs. He left the game with a jammed finger he suffered stealing third base after doubling to lead off the game. He scored on a sacrifice fly byJoe Morgan. 
With one out in the second, Jim Essian walked, went to second on a fielder's choice and scored ahead of Henderson's 15th home run.

were no turnovers; that's right, no interceptions and no fumbles -just errorless execution.That's what the Irish are capable of. "We've put together six straight quarters of in­tense football," commented Irish tailback Allen Pinkett. "This after­noon it all came together. This is what we needed." 
Consistently good football: that is what Notre Dame is capable of and the players are finally realizing that. 
"The momentum carried through from last week's game against MSU. It's like a snowball effect, it just gets bigger and bigger," commented Johnson. "We're finally realizing how good we can be:" 
Colorado is not a Penn State or a Nebraska, but that's not important. Colorado gave the Irish the confi­dence they need to play a team like Miami. After playing two consistent halves offootball the Irish know that they are a good football team. Now they just have to prove it.
