Former governor Babbit returns to NO to speak 
By COLLEEN GANNON 
News Writer 
Americans havn accepted that it is tlw business of government to do nothing. former Arizona Governor Bruc1~ Babbit said Tuesday. 
"It was the right thing to do, becaus11 I had something to say," s1~id Babbit in rderenee to his candidacy in the 1988 presidential Plection. Although lw rm:ognized the long odds for winning. Babbit said he entered tlw raen to convey a message. 
"l'olitieal leaders in this eountry are not talking up to thfl Amflrican elflctorate. We am a society fnmm in compla­ceney," hfl said. According to Babbil, Americans have ac­cept!Jd "that the sole function of government is to maximize 


English majors sidestep many of DART's faults by pre-registering 
opportunity and income." 
"I am troubled by the inability of our political leaders to lay out simple truth to the American people about where we are in this world, about our inability to match spending and income," he said. 
Leaders need to say that the United States cannot continue to live beyond its means, Babbit said. According to Babbit, leaders need to tell Americans that the reason government consumes so much of our in­come is not because of people of welfare or people of poverty, but "because we created a huge infrastructure of entitlement programs for the middle class." 
"We have to sharpen our fo­cus about doing something about the people on the streets of this land that do need help,"

"When DAHT was put into operation. we saw absolutely no relation between what our advising was telling students to do and what they were doing," he said. Buttigieg noted that students would decide upon classes with their advisor, only to be denied the courses during registration and forced to reg­ister for classes they had no in­terest in. 
So as not to risk losing the strength of the advising system, the English department ap­proached the Hegistrar's office for a compromise. "After all, the University claims to be very interested in advising," Buttigieg said. "we didn't want to throw it away." 
The result was a unique pre-

However, Babbit said Americans cannot get some­thing for nothing. "Of course we have to raise taxes," he said.

registration process that allows English majors to ehoose their classes within the department before DART registration begins. "We have linked advising with registration in a way that the DART system would not have enabled us to do," Buttigieg said. 
English majors receive pre­registration information and schedule appointments with their advisors before October break. The pre-registration process itself is staggered like DART, starting with the seniors. 
Pre-registration begins before 8 a.m., but the earlier students form the line outside the English office, the better chance they will ha.ve to register the classes of their choice.

student body president and resident of Zahm Hall, said, "I came to Notre Dame as a product of a Catholic experi­ence." He said that he grew up in a Catholic Church driven by rules. 
In his first year at Notre Dame, he said that he found two faces of the Catholic Church. "One face was an ex­tension of the Catholic Church that I grew up in," he said. "The Church was obsessed with authoritarian tradition," he added. 
Another face of Catholicism that Babbit observed "seemed to emphasize the sacramental quality of faith and worth." 
Babbit said he then became acquainted with "the idea that Catholicism is not rules." Events occurring in his life at

that time, "slowing drew me to the notion that my sense of Catholicism really did relate to a eertain sense of obligation projected outward onto other people," he said. 
"I left here (Notre Dame) carrying that expnrience with me," Babbit said. 
Although he lost the election, Babbit said he learned some­thing from it. "The 1988 cam­paign never went anywhere," he said. According to Babbit. the campaign's inability to get off the ground fated his party for failure. "Nobody wanted any change," he said.

Minor injuries, little damage reported from snowball fight 
By PAUL PEARSON 
Assistant News Editor 

Nearly 500 students took part in an all-campus snowball fight Tunsday, according to Chuck Hurley, assistant direc­tor of Notre Damn Security. 
Hurley said that the annual evnnt was "more subdund" than any like it in previous years. 
Security officers were pa­trolling the ND campus throughout the night. No major injuries or extensive property damage was reported. 
At approximat11ly 11 :50 p.m., a resident of Flanner Ilall re­portnd damagn to his seeond­noor window from the snow­ball fight. Hurley said. No other damage to property was re­portnd. 
According to a source at Uni­versity Health Services. two students were sent to hospital emergency rooms for minor lacerations. and one student suffered an eye injury. Less than ten others were treated for minor cuts and bruises. 
Father Andre Leveille, rector of Cavanaugh Hall, said that most students in his hall did not participate in the snowball fight this year. "We asked our guys to stay in the hall. and most of them stayed in the hall," he said. 
After last year's snowball fight. which caused widespread damage to campus buildings, Father David Tyson, then-vice president of Student Affairs, suspendnd $20,000 in matching funds to cover the damage. After many students protested the decision, the matching funds were eventually rein­stated. 
Gulf Crisis Action Group starts campaign to Congressmen to discourage war in Iraq 

By MARK CAWLEY 
News Writer 
The Gulf Crisis Action Group has started a letter writing campaign to encourage members of the House of Representatives to deter an American first­strike against Iraq. 
The action group began this campaign because, "The costs of war outweigh any gains and the potential for escalation is too great," said group member Tara Verdonk. "We believe a U.S. attack would intensify and entrench hatred for America in the region, making future Middle East disputes more likely and more difficult to resolve," she added. 
Several'alternatives to war have been encouraged by the Gulf Crisis Action Group. 
"United Nations-sponsored, non-violent sanctions, which do not include food and medicine, should be given a chance to take their ell'ect on the Iraqi economy," said Verdonk. "A negotiated settlement should be actively pursued," she said. 
The Group, in a written statement. also encouraged the establishment of a U.N. peace-keeping force to aet as a buffer between Iraq and Saudi Arabia. This force would replace American led troops in the region. The establishment of alternative fuel sources and an end to the American reliance on foreign oil was also recommended by the Gulf Crisis Action Group. 
"We oppose military action in defense of our access to re­sources. the consumption of which we need to scale back in order to save our fragiln environmnnt," stated the Group. 
The letter writing campaign is being financed primarily by members of the Gulf Crisis Action Group. "We have all sort off chippnd in," said Tara Vnrdonk. Tlw Center for Social Coneerns has also donated its photocopiers for usn in the campaign. 
The action group's campaign will begin today from 7 to 10 p.m. at the Center for Social Concerns coffee house. It will continue on Thursday and Friday in the library eoncourse from 2 to 5 p.m. Thn group will be soliciting signatures for petitions and will provide fact sheets for those who wish to write their own letters.

INSIDE COLUMN 


The five most livable cities in America 
There's been a de---------­bate going on lately as to which city in the 
U.S. is considered the best place to live. Certain magazines have gone so far as to rank various cities in order of 'liveability.' Michael Owen 
Some have gone out 
on a limb to claim News Copy Editor Seattle as the best place to live. In my book, any place that has rain for more than a month of the year must be disqualified (this, of course, does exclude the meteorological nightmare 
known as South Bend, Ind., where rain cov­ers the heinous ethanol stench). Therefore, I offer my personal list of the top five all­round best places to live. Each meet my own following criteria: entertainment, culture, weather, originality and general beauty of the population. So here goes: 
5) CHICAGO, Ill.-This city has many things going for it. Entertainment includes some of the nation's best sports teams. Cul­ture is represented by the variety of art and historical museums. However, Chicago, you lose in weather and general beauty. I don't really enjoy wearing an arctic parka in May because the wind hasn't stopped. The gen­eral beauty index is not up to par with the cities ahead of it, either. 
4) BURLINGTON,Vt.-Strong in every­thing except a little culture, but we can ig­nore that when you see how cool this place is. It is home to the University of Vermont ("Groovy UV"), where the opulent skiers and environmental crunchies mesh to make this one of the most beautiful and intellec­tual cities in the U.S. Eternal love for Jerry Garcia, great bars, Lake Champlain, and a Socialist mayor make this the perfect place to raise some young'uns. It's a veritable Berkeley of the East without the California attitude. 
3) TIE -CLEVELAND, Ohio and TREN­TON, N.J.-(just kidding) 
2) LAS VEGAS, Nev.-"Viva-a-a-Las Ve­gas, pretty momma" as The King once said. It's hot and sunny all year round. Talk about entertainment-where do I start? And the abundance of friendly, hard-work­ing women make this my #2. Anyplace fre­quented by Wayne Newton, Liberace, and The King is the hub of the universe. Except for the fact that it's in the same state used for underground nuclear tests, it's a great place. 
1) NEW YORK, N.Y.-As if you hadn't al­ready guessed. Everything you'd ever want and every type of person can be found here. Eight million people can't be wrong. Before you scream in disagreement, I suggest you check it out for yourself. 
*NOTE-all other cities not on the list are considered to be the same city. They are merely duplicated around the country and given a liberty bell. an arch, etc. so we can tell them apart.

A federal judge upheld a ban on guns in Richmond, Virginia's public housing projects, setting a precedent for the rest of the nation, the housing authority director said Tuesday. The ruling Monday by U.S. District Judge Richard Williams marked the first time a court has decided whether public housing residents can be barred from having guns, said Richard Gentry, executive director of the Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority. Gentry said guns also are banned in public housing pro­jects in Chicago, but that ban has not been challenged in court. "This is a unique court case," he said. "Now this can be used as a precedent throughout the country." 
INDIANA 
Strong winds and cold weather moved across northern Indiana Tuesday, causing more problems for residents still recovering from last week's floods. The National Weather Service is­sued a winter storm watch for northwestern In­diana tonight and Tuesday because of the poten­tial for heavy lake effect snows. The area extends from Gary to South Bend. An earlier weather ad­visory for snow and sleet in north central Indiana was cancelled by late morning. Dangerous driving conditions were reported in northern Indiana this morning. Roads were slushy from LaGrange to Angola with winds gusting to 55 mph, the weather service said. Up to 1 1/2 inches of rain fell west of a line from Lafayette to Fort Wayne Sunday night, with the greatest amounts falling in portions of Clay, Putnam, Hendricks, Marion and Hamilton counties in west central and central Indiana.

The Hall Presidents' Council (HPC) discussed the advantages and disadvantages of the new housekeeping concept that took effect at the beginning of the year. 
Colonel David Woods, director of Support Services, explained that the housekeeping program has undergone and requested recommendations from II PC members. 
According to Woods, the sys­tem used at the beginning of the 1990-91 year has been sig­nificantly changed. Housekeepers do more exten­sive work in the dorms; teams of maids no longer rotate dur­ing the week, but one team is permanently assigned to a spe­cific dorm, continued Woods. 
Moreover, "we have put more people in the halls than before," he said. 
Hall presidents had a variety of complaints, including: 
 St. Edward's Senior Jim McCarthy, who commented that both students and maids miss the contact between students and staff. "They think that the daily interaction was an inte­gral part of their job...(They are) not as attentive to the 
.needs of students, "said McCarthy. Students have found that the old relationships and friendships have been lost, continued McCarthy. 
 
Junior Laura Mollach of Pasquerilla West recommended that the showers be cleaned after 11 a.m. so as to avoid de­laying students in the early morning. 

 
Other council members said that showers and bathrooms were not cleaned often enough, that showers were not always in functioning order, and that miscellaneous insects and ro­dents were not handled effec­tively. 


Woods requested students to cooperate with the new system, 
page 3 

and to report complaints to Support Services. 
In other business: 
 Student Senator Lisa Bostwick present11d the Senate resolution listing suggestions for carrying out the recom­mendations of the Student Government report to the Board of Trustees on sexuality. 
The resolution calls for mea­sures to be taken to revise ND policy on sexual assault and acquaintance rape on campus. "Total silence on such inci­dents," read the resolution, "leads to a false sense of secu­rity and the conception of ac­quaintance rape as a lesson or acceptable crime." 
The resolution was passed unanimously by HPC. 
 Morrissey Hall representa­tives announced that the Morrissey Film Festival will take place March 1, 1991, in Cushing Auditorium. Proceeds will benefit "a charitable cause."

According to Kris Kurtz Ohlson, manager of the Com­munity Marketing Division of the United Way of St. Joseph's County, the funds will allow the Food Bank of Michiana to buy 18,000 pounds of food at 6 cents per pound. The retail value averages $1.40 per pound, so the money will bring the equivalent of $25,000 worth to the community.

If New York Governor Mario Cuomo decides to run in the 1992 presidential election, Babbit said he would definitely support Cuomo. 
After his defeat in the 1988 election, Babbit said, his son "had internalized this defeat as somehow his fault." Babbit then walked up with his son to the Lincoln Memorial. He looked at the statue and said, "You see that is what it is all about." 
"It is not about holding office, it is not about winning. That man lost virtually every election he ever contested," Babbit said. It is really about getting involved and trying to make a difference, he concluded.

Bush says "No" to giving sanctions a year to work 
MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (APJ -!'resident Bush on Tuesday firmly rejected recommenda­tions from former Pentagon chiefs to give sanctions against Iraq at least a year to work be­fore resorting to military force. 
Bush, on the second day of a salute-to-democracy tour across South America, ex­pressed doubt that ·sanctions 
alone  would  bring  (Iraq's  
Saddam  Hussein)  to  his  
senses."  

Saying that many countries' economies "are being devas­tated" by oil prices that have soared during the gulf crisis, Bush vowed, "This is not going to go on forever." 
So far, he said, the Iraqi leader "has not gotten the mes­sage" that he must get out of Kuwait. 
The United Nations resolution authorizing force against Iraq unless it withdraws from Kuwait by Jan. 15 was "loud and clear," Bush said. "But I don't think Saddam Hussein yet understands that." 
"The best hope for peace is for him to understand that all means -all means -neces­sary to fulfill these resolutions

will be used against him," Bush said at a news conference with Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle. 
The Persian Gulf crisis was at the top of his agenda as Bush arrived here from Brazil for talks with Lacalle and an ad­dress to Congress. Several hun­dred leftist demonstrators protested outside as Bush spoke to the lawmakers. 
As Bush spoke, former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara added his voice to the list of witnesses before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee urging caution in the stand against Iraq. 
"Who can doubt that a year of blockade will be cheaper than a week of war?" said McNamara, who led the Pentagon during the U.S. buildup in Vietnam. 
Bush should not act "without the approval of the American people expressed by the ap­proval of the Congress," said the former Johnson adminis­tration official. 
Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D., said, "If we start having body bags come back, we will have a very serious revolt in terms of public opinion."

Iraq offers to free Soviet hostages 
(AP)-Saddam Hussein on Tuesday backed away from his confrontation with the Kremlin, promising to release the 3,300 Soviets he was holding. Moscow had warned it would use mili­tary force against Iraq if Soviets there were harmed. 
Meanwhile, according to a British news report late Tuesday, Iraq may be ready to withdraw from most of Kuwait as long as it is allowed to keep the disputed Rumailah oil field that crosses two miles into Kuwaiti territory. 
In New York, a late burst of buying sparked by the Sky tele­vision report that the Iraqi president was considering withdrawing his occupying forces from Kuwait lifted the stock market from a 25-point decline a half-hour -before clos­ing to a 14.11-point Dow Jones

gain, closing at 2,579.70. 
The rumors fanned specula­tion the gulf crisis could be re­solved without bloodshed. 
The Sky TV news report said Saddam has been detailing his negotiating position on the gulf dispute in private meetings with mediators that include Soviet envoy Yevgeny Primakov. 
In exchange for a guarantee against any Western attack on Iraq, the report said he would pull out of all of Kuwait except for the oil field in southern Iraq. 
Saddam also would give back the strategically important is­lands of Bubiyan and Warba, as long as Kuwait would discuss leasing them, and he would accept the return of the Kuwaiti royal family, which fled when Iraq invaded Aug. 2, according to the report.

Before the Persian Gulf crisis began, Moscow was Iraq's chief weapons supplier and main ally. The Kremlin has not sent troops to join the U.S.-led multinational force stationed in Saudi Arabia. 
Speaking in Montevideo, Uruguay, earlier Tuesday on his second stop on a South American tour, President Bush said Saddam "has not gotten the message" that he must get out of Kuwait. 
Britain's prime minister, John Major, also talked tough on the gulf, ruling out negotiations with Iraq or any "partial solu­tions or linkages to other is­sues." 
Iraq had warned foreign companies and employees it would demand compensation for any contract breached after its invasion. 
In Moscow, presidential spokesman Vitaly lgnatenko said 3,232 Soviets remained in Iraq. Thousands. more left In the months after the invasion. 
Moscow adopted a harder line against Iraq last week when It accused Saddam of breaking a promise to allow Soviets to leave. 
Iraq is holding hundreds of Westerners, many at strategic sites, to deter attack by the 340,000-strong U.S.-led multi­national force deployed in the gulf. Soviets are not believed among those used as "human shields." 
Saddam has said he would free all hostages between Christmas and March 25 pro­vided Washington and its allies do not take military action. That period is considered the optimum time for an offensive to drive the Iraqis from Kuwait. 
The Iraqi decision Tuesday was seen as an attempt by Saddam to forestall any Soviet military intervention in the gulf that might cement the U.S.-Ied coalition already poised in the region against him. 
But releasing the Soviets is not likely to assuage Moscow's mounting impatience with Saddam over his refusal to leave Kuwait, nor imperil its growing alliance with the West. 
In Washington, congressional hearings continued on the Bush administration's gulf policy. 
Senate Democrats have re­peatedly urged Bush to stick with the economic embargo against Iraq, rather than rush into a war. White House offi­cials, however, have said the sanctions aren't working. 
''I've not been one whose been convinced that sanctions alone will bring him to his senses," Bush said Tuesday. 
Of Saddam, the president said: "I am convinced that up until now, at least, he has not gotten the message" that he must withdraw from Kuwait.

Two defendants in Bensonhurst case cleared of murder charges 

NEW YORK (AP) -1\vo white men were acquitted of murder Tuesday in the racially­motivated slaying of a black teenager in a mob attack in the city's Bensonhurst section last year. 
The jury took just four hours to return the verdicts for James Patino and Joseph Serrano fol­lowing a two-week trial. The two smiled broadly as the ver­dicts were read, hugged their lawyer and then embraced in state Supreme Court in Brooklyn. 
Also Tuesday, another jury heard closing arguments in the retrial of Bensonhurst defen­dant John Vento. He is being retried for murder, manslaugh­ter and riot after his first trial ended with a hung jury. 
The verdict makes Patino the first defendant in the case to be cleared of all charges.

wonderful, said Patino, 25, out­side the courthouse. ''I'm glad everything's over." · 
''I'm sorry for what happened to Yusuf Hawkins, but I had nothing to with it," said Serrano, 21, after the verdict. "I was confident. I was secure in my innocence." 
Both defendants had been ac­cused of murder, manslaughter, riot, discrimination and other charges in the attack that resulted in the death of Hawkins, who was shot in the mostly white Brooklyn neigh­borhood on Aug. 23, 1989. 
Patino was found innocent of all the crimes. Serrano was convicted only of a misde­meanor weapons possession charge that is punishable by up to a year in prison. 
Prosecutor Edward Boyar shrugged and told reporters, "I never quibble with a jury's ver­dict." 
Hawkins' killing was the most serious racial incident in the city since the 1986 killing of a 23-year-old black man in Howard Beach. In that con­frontation, the victim was struck and killed by a car after a mob of whites chased him onto a highway. 
Hawkins, 16, was slain when he and three friends -all black teenagers went to Bensonhurst to look at a used car. The unarmed youths at­tracted the attention of a mob of as many as 30 bat-wielding whites looking for a fight. 

In Vento's case, Assistant District Attorney Paul Burns said Vento was "an active re­cruiter" and "one of the leaders · of the mob." 
"Joseph Fama, acting by himself, could never have committed this crime," Burns said, referring to the convicted murderer of Hawkins.

"The people that were first in 
line had been there since 7:30," 
she said. 
Buttigieg commended the de­
sire of students to take certain 
classes, even if it means pulling 
an all-nighter to register. "I 
think it's very interesting to no­
tice there's a group of students 
so interested in taking our 
courses that they will stay up 
all night for them." 
"A lot of this [pre-registra­
tion] came as a result from this 
student desire to have a struc­
tw:ed curriculum," he added. 
Student desire to take English 
classes goes beyond the English 
major though, and Buttigieg 
acknowledges the difficulties 
for students to complete a 
University requirement, if they 
should choose to take a litera­
ture course to do so. 
The number of English ma­
jors is presently hovering in the 
450-470 range, Buttigieg said. 
The increase in majors by 50­
60 from last year is indicative 
of the "upward climb" the de­
partment has seen in the past 
five years, he said. 
Five years ago the English 
department's majors were still 
in the 300-350 range, accord­
ing to Buttigieg. 
,\,, ,, ,,,, 
~,:.~
Give to the United Way. 
"' 
This increase has posed problems for majors and non­majors alike. While majors fmd the difficulties in getting their first choices, non-majors are faced with the potential unavailability of all classes. 
The department originally planned to offer 29 courses at the 300-level, and 31 at the 400-level for the spring semester. However, noting that there were only 16 spots left in the entire department, Buttigieg said that two addi­tional 300-level classes will be added. 
Accommodating the influx in students can be difficult, he said. While raising the number of student per class is often the choice, it affects the structure of the traditionally-small dis­cussion and writing courses. 
"We would like to have English classes of no more than 35," Buttigieg said, "but we are presently at 45." 
Adding faculty members to the department is the University's long-term goal, ac­cording to Buttigieg, but the additions will take time. At the rate of adding one professor per year, the department hopes to "gradually absorb the majors and non-majors." 
Buttigieg says he sees the root of registration problems to be the rise in majors, but does not see an immediate solution. "If there weren't so many majors, we would not need to offer so many 400-level courses," he said. "And if .there weren't so many 400-level courses, we could better appease the non­majors."

Beirut, divided by civil war, starts reunification process 
BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -A bulldozer roared into the ru­ined, mine-strewn former ur­ban battleground in the heart of Beirut on Tuesday to remove the fortifications and rubble of 15 1/2 years of civil war. 
Stray dogs emerged from shell-shattered buildings, bark­ing furiously as the huge yellow machine began demolishing an earth embankment that split the Christian and Moslem sec­tors of the capital. 
Martyr's Square and sur­rounding streets, the former business center of Beirut, were part of the no man's land that became overgrown with bushes and small trees sprouting from cracks in pavement. 
Two small anti-personnel mines exploded under the bull­dozer's chains as it went to work. The bulldozer was not affected by the small blasts, but a Lebanese army captain ordered work stopped until troops cleared the area. 
"Luckily there were no anti­tank mines planted in this part of the Green Line," said an army captain, referring to the demarcation line that once di­vided the city. "Such mines would have wrecked the bull­dozer." 
The army deployed in down­town Beirut on Monday in the first phase of a government plan to reunify the capital and end the civil warfare that has killed more than 150,000 peo­ple. 
The area around Martyr's Square just north of the port of Beirut was the scene of some of the war's most savage battles as Christian and Moslem mili­tias clashed repeatedly for con­trol. 
The crumbling facades of the old multistory buildings fronting on the square are pep­pered with bullet and shell­holes, their interiors gutted by fire and shells. 
A rusty popcorn machine, scarred with bullet and shrap­nel holes, stood on the sidewalk outside the Roxy movie theater beneath a sign proclaiming "non-stop showings." 
Another small sign on the first floor of the Roxy building, also full of bullet holes, said "Music lessons for 30 pounds a month." 
"I wonder if they will teach music here again. Anyway, it won't be for 30 pounds a month," said the army captain, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
The civil war shattered Lebanon's booming economy. The Lebanese pound, once the most stable currency in the Middle East, fell from its pre­war value of 2.5 to the U.S. dollar to 1,250 to the dollar in August. 
The currency began regaining strength after the rival sides accepted an Arab League-bro­kered peace plan requiring them to withdraw from Beirut as the first step in a pacification program. The militia with­drawal started last month and was considered completed in the greater Beirut area Monday. 
On Tuesday, the Lebanese pound traded at 690 to the dol­lar.

Church fails to implement real solutions to abortion problem 
Dear Editor: 
This past break, three other students and I shared Thanksgiving with the residents of St. Martin de Porres House of Hope. This experience opened my eyes to many incon­sistencies of the Catholic Church-one, in particular, is their stance on abortion. 
Unlike many aspects of the Catholic Church, the House of Hope deals more with realities of society, rather than abstract ideologies. The hierarchies in the Catholic Church could cer­tainly learn a lot from Sister Connie Driscoll and Sister Therese O'Sullivan, the founders of the House of Hope. 
The House of Hope is a non­profit Christian shelter for homeless women and children and pregnant teens in the Woodlawn community in south­east Chicago. Since 1983, Sister Connie and Sister Therese have been running the shelter. Their main objective is to address the needs of homeless women and children in the community. Unlike most shelters I have visited, the House of Hope is not a temporary haven for the poor, but a means for victims of society to acquire a renewed sense of importance through personal responsibility; thus, the system at the House of Hope is geared in such a way that it guides the residents towards 
Sports and music unfortunately dominate NO student lifestyles 
independence and long-term success. 
Unlike the power-holding bu­reaucrats in Rome who set the guidelines by which Catholics are to live, Sister Connie and Sister Therese are dealing with humans on a day-to-day basis. While the Church is ceaselessly pouring money into advertising its stance against abortion, the House -of Hope is providing ac­tual alternatives to abortion. The Catholic Church fails to al­lot .an equivalent amount of funding to actually help those mothers who chose not to abort as they do to preach on the immorality of abortion. One could conclude from the Church's flow of funds that they are more concerned with the appearance of being pro-life, than the actual consequences of that stance. 
Instead, the Church should work to diminish the demand for abortion by providing more options like the House of Hope. Sister Connie and Sister Therese are following up on the Church's firm position against abortion. Perhaps the Church should consider sinking more money into similar programs like the House of Hope instead of into ways to indoctrinate society with their beliefs.

Dear Editor: 
As a WVFI deejay and a var­sity athlete, I am disappointed and disgusted at what I've read in the pages of The Observer. I am disappointed in Ken Tysiac's unjournalistic and un­warranted attack on WVFI and its deejays (The Observer, Nov. 20). I am disgusted about a letter in response (The Observer, Nov. 27) from a quartet of my colleagues and its tongue-in-cheek commentary about Notre Dame and its sports teams. And I am downright sickened by the reactionary rhetoric Jeff Jotz spews in his letter (The Observer, Nov. 27). 
Jeff Jotz's letter evokes the strongest response from me be­cause it illustrates the lack of rational thought put into this whole affair. His big words make little sense except to say, "I don't know anything!" The same goes for the rest of the parties. 
Good journalists do research before they decide to point out the fault in an operation. If Tysiac had bothered to check out WVFI, the first thing he would find is an out-dated transmitter which cannot send a signal which covers the entire campus. Secondly, he would find out that the WVFI received over 160 applications for six deejay positions (hardly a lack of interest) at the start of the school year. Also, Tysiac would find several dedicated individu­als who wish to enter the music industry and need the experi­ence WVFI offers, much like The Observer offers journalistic experience for future writers. 
To my colleagues about their letters, I'm appalled. As a varsity lacrosse player, I sacrifice between 15 and 30 hours a week for practice, conditioning, meetings and games without any real ac­knowledgement from the cam­pus. The authors criticize the narrow-mindedness of Ken Tysiac, yet close their eyes to the sacrifices made by the vast number of varsity athletes outside football and basketball who play for the love of the sport and not the recognition. 
I hope The Observer will raise its journalistic standards and not print such grossly self­serving articles as Ken Tysiac's. As for the rest of us, I hope we realize there is more to life than sports and music (like getting along and acting rationally).

Vanderbilt players try to adapt to new head coach 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -Still stung over the removal of Watson Brown as Vanderbilt's football coach, Commodore football players are now trying to adapt to new head coach Gerry DiNardo. DiNardo, who is credited with developing top-ranked Colorado's I-Bone offense, on Monday accepted the challenge of revamping the Vanderbilt University football program. 
DiNardo was introduced by athletic director Paul Hoolahan at a morning press conference less than 18 hours after an emotional meeting between Brown and his players. Brown then publicly announced he was stepping down as football coach after five seasons at his alma mater that produced a 10-45 record. 
"The only consolation is that coach DiNardo is coming in. He seems like he can get the job done," said Vanderbilt junior safety Steve Medes after listening to DiNardo speak to the school's athletic staff and the media. 
"I think it's a great choice," said offensive tackle Bobby Craycraft. "Colorado has a winning tradition and I think he can come in here and be a win­ner. We're still hurting over coach Brown, but we have to rebound." 
DiNardo signed a five-year contract. He said he is con­vinced he can turn around a football program which has produced only four winning seasons since 1960 and won only four of 33 Southeastern Conference games under Brown. 
"The challenge at Vanderbilt is to identify the student-athlete that not only wants to compete in maybe the best classrooms in the country, but also wants to compete in a great conference. I believe with our resources and with all our energies we can attract enough of these kind of student-athletes," said DiNardo, 38. 
DiNardo, who said he is now on the job full-time at Vanderbilt and will not be a part of Colorado's Orange Bowl game with Notre Dame on Jan. 1, received high praise from Buffaloes coach Bill McCartney. 
'Gerry is ideally suited to turn the Vanderbilt program around," McCartney said. "He is bright, resourceful, a great recruiter and a tireless worker. He will work feverishly to suc­ceed. But, most important, he is very sensitive to student-ath­letes and develops a good rela­tionship with his players." 
After learning of Brown's re­assignment to a fund-raising position within the university, Vanderbilt players on Sunday night circulated a petition in which they asked Hoolahan and Chancellor Joe B. Wyatt to name current Commodore as­sistant coach Steve Sloan as the successor. 
"Our choice was coach Sloan, but obviously the decision al­ready had been made," said sophomore fullback Carlos Thomas, the Commodores' leading rusher this season. "We're still upset about the sit­uation and I'm still in shock." 
DiNardo said he is aware that he is replacing a very popular figure on the Vanderbilt campus. 
"I've never met coach Brown, but I understand his popularity. It's something I can't do a great deal about," DiNardo said. "I am concerned about the players and their ability to rebound from this situation and go on and set their energies toward Sept. 7 (1991) when we go to Syracuse.

Theus scores 29 in Nets' win 
Cleveland rallies behind Paddio in comeback victory 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -Reggie Theus scored 29 points and Mookie Blaylock added 16 points, 10 assists and a key block in the final seconds Tuesday night as the New Jersey Nets beat Seattle 106­102 and sent the SuperSonics to their sixth straight loss. 
The victory was the fifth in six games for New Jersey. Seattle, off to its worst start since 1977­78, has lost 10 of 11. 
Although the Nets failed to score a field goal over the last 
7:37 of the second quarter, they took the lead for good on four free throws by Derrick Gervin and one each by Blaylock and Jack Haley. New Jersey led 55­49 at halftime. 
Cavs 121, Nuggets 117 
Gerald Paddio scored 12 points in the fourth quarter to lead Cleveland to a come-from­behind 121-117 victory over Denver to keep the Nuggets winless on the road in seven tries. 
Paddio, with 23 points, scored Cleveland's last three baskets, including two in the last minute, to break a 117 tie. Cleveland had fallen behind by as many as 20 in the second quarter. 
Cleveland took the lead at 113­112 on a layup by Brad Daugherty with 3:48 left to give the Cavaliers their first lead after the Nuggets grabbed a 9-8 lead in the first period. Daugherty finished with a team-high 31 points. 
Trail Blazers 98, Heat 95 

Terry Porter scored four of his 26 points in the final 30 seconds as the Portland Trail Blazers held off a late Miami rally and posted a 98-95 win over the Heat. 
The score was tied at 93 when Porter hit a 20-foot jumper with 
28.8 seconds remaining. After Miami's Grant Long hit one of two free throws at the 16­second mark, Porter was fouled by Long and hit twice from the line, making it 97-94 Portland. 
The Heat's Glen Rice then missed a 3-point effort and the Trail Blazers' Buck Williams grabbed the rebound. He was fouled and made one of two from the line to put his team up 98-94 with 7.4 seconds left. 
Magic 113, Knicks 102 

The Orlando Magic won their first road game in 11 tries this season and spoiled John MacLeod's debut as coach of the New York Knicks with a 113-102 victory. 
The Magic, who also snapped a seven-game losing streak, never trailed after Scott Skiles and Dennis Scott keyed an 11-0 run with 3-pointers early in the third quarter. 
Wolves 83, Pacers 81 

Sam Mitchell made two free throws with one-tenth of a sec­ond to play and the Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Indiana Pacers 83-81 despite blowing an 18-point fourth-
quarter lead. 
Mike Sanders scored on a re­bound of a miss by Rik Smits with 2 1/2 seconds remaining as the Pacers, who trailed 66­48 entering the final period, tied the game 81-81. 
But Mitchell caught the in­bounds pass about 25 feet from the basket, took a." dribble and faked both Sanders and Smits into the air. Sanders was called for the foul. 
76ers 109, Bucks 1 08, OT 
Charles Barkley made two free throws with no time remaining in overtime as the Philadelphia 76ers beat the Milwaukee Bucks 109-108. 
Barkley, who scored a season­high 42 points, grabbed Rick Mahorn's blocked shot and was fouled by Jack Sikma. A three­point play by Alvin Robertson had given the Bucks a 108-103 lead with 2:42 to go. 
Ron Anderson made a jumper and Hersey Hawkins made two free throws to pull Philadelphia to 108-107 with 34 seconds remaining. Milwaukee called time out but Sikma was called for a charging foul with 17 seconds left. 
Bulls 155, Suns 127 
Michael Jordan scored 27 points and Horace Grant matched his career high with 25 and the Chicago Bulls won their sixth straight game, a 155-127 stomping of the Phoenix Suns. 
The total was a Bulls' regular­season record for points in a regulation game and was a point shy of the mark set in Portland in four overtimes. It was the Bulls' fourth con­secutive win where they have beaten an opponent by at least

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -Experts in former East Germany developed a doping nasal spray before the 1988 Olympics that was virtually undetectable, a leading swimmer alleged Tuesday. 
Raik Hannemann, who on Monday admitted taking performance-e nh ancin g drugs, said the spray had the same effect as anabolic steroids and traces of its use would disappear after three days. 
Hannemann and other ath­letes on Tuesday accused former East German sports chiefs of developing a perfect, systematic doping program and of offering hard currency as an incentive for taking drugs. 
Meanwhile,. the magazine Stern said East German ex­perts conducted experiments on athletes with drugs de­signed to improve their per­

In Canada, Ben Johnson's former track coach said he

did not take the recent reve­lations as vindication. The coach, Charlie Francis, has said many times that steroid use was widespread. 
''I'm not asking for it (vindication)," Francis said. "I just said what everybody knew.... I don't call it cheating. My definition of cheating is doing something nobody else is doing." 
The growing doping scandal is shaking sports in united Germany and threatening to cut off support from wealthy corporate sponsors. 
A newspaper in former East Germany suggested a "general international amnesty" for all athletes, to be followed by tougher con­trols and stiffer penalties for drug offenders. 
Hannemann, writing in a bylined article for the Berliner Kurier am Abend newspaper, said the nasal spray was developed by East German sports doctors.

A veteran safety known as one of the NFL's hardest tacklers, Lott was on crutches Tuesday after being examined at the 49ers' practice facility by Dr. Michael Dillingham, a team physician. 
"Both of my knees are pretty sore," said Lott, who indicated the left one was in worse shape. "I don't think any bones are broken or there are any chips. I think the MRI (magnetic reso­nant image) is going to show ... the extent of (the ligament damage)." 
Seifert said during his weekly news conference, "A number of our defensive players are banged up and sore." He said Lott's injuries were the most serious. Lott said he sprained his right knee tackling Bavaro on the Giants' second play of the fourth quarter. He sprained the left knee in the final minutes when Kevin Fagan dove over a pile players and crashed into Lott's left shin. 
Neither injury forced Lott to the sidelines of the punishing, physical game between NFC powers. 
"I just wanted to finish the game," Lott said. "At the time, I didn't think I was risking any further damage.... I just taped it up and kept playing.... Looking back now I probably was (risking a more serious in­jury). Luckily, I came out with­out anything happening."

Fontes kicks Williams off Lions' squad, warns Peete 
PONTIAC, Mich. (API Citing discipline and attitude, Detroit coach Wayne Fontes threw a key player off the team and told quarterback Rodney Peete to quit whining and start producing. 
"It was something that had to be done," Fontes said after releasing linebacker Jimmy Williams on Monday. "Discipline and attitude is what we're trying to get across herB. 
"He's been a very good player here, a fine player. But I don't want anybody here to put themselves ahead of this team." 
Williams, the Lions' No. draft pic-k out of Nebraska in 1982. was released because of an altercation that took place on the side­line during Detroit's 23-17 loss in Chicago on Sunday. 
Fontes said he didn't see or hear the altercation because he was watching thH action on the field at the time. When he learned about it afterward, on the short flight home from Chicago, the coach told Williams they would talk early the next morning. 
Fontes wouldn't be more specific, but the incident is believed to have taken plaee in the seeond quarter shortly after a 10-yard roughing penalty against Williams gave the Bears a first down at the Lions' 11. The Bears scored four plays later to take a 14-10 lead. 
Following the penalty, Williams apparently had heated words with assistant coaches and teammates whHn he came off the field. 
"Had I known, I'd have taken him out right then," Fontes said. "I have a say­ing: 'The inmates should never run the asylum."'

Still, MacLeod comes in with an optimistic attitude. He made that clear at Monday's practice. 
"We started to emphasize team play and the importance of pulling together and com­municating and helping out," MacLeod said. "I think we have the right personality. The key is the 'want to.' Do they want to just have a good year or be playing when others are at home watching on television?

under MacLeod at Phoenix for 11 years, turned to his old friend. 
"His strengths are his disci­pline and he is a meticulous guy right down the line," Bianchi said. "It's difficult to be that consistent all the time, and that is one of the things that amazed me about him. "When we were at Phoenix. the 
6:00 bus left at 5:45 because everybody already was on it. If they were not there on time, they knew it would go, so they all would be there early. 
"If John says it's a 10:00 practice and the hands on the clock are straight up, it's time to start. 
"I think that kind of discipline and stuff filters down and it gets you to execute on the floor. 
I think those strengths are what this team needs, that discipline, that kind of guy." 
This is not the first time Bianchi has tried to hire MacLeod to coach the Knicks. When Rick Pitino left for Kentucky after the 1988-89 season, Bianchi first went after MacLeod, who turned around teams at the University of Oklahoma and with the Suns. 
"The timing was not right," said MacLeod, 53, who was with the Dallas Mavericks then and didn't want to move his family. "For me, now is right. I've been out of coaching for a year, doing television and scouting, so I stayed current." 
The current Knicks team doesn't shoot well from the outside, rarely sets any picks and has little identity, aside from Patrick Ewing's often­heroic work at center. What ultimately cost Jackson the job, however, was the Knicks' poor showings at home, where they are 3-5. 
Not that Jackson was working from strength. Bianchi did little to upgrade the team's roster after it lost to the Pistons in last spring's playoffs.

San Francisco closes in on relief pitcher Righetti 
ROSEMONT. Ill. (AP) -Dave Righetti and the money-mad San Francisco Giants zeroed in on each other Tuesday while the price of pitching again zoomed when the Boston Red Sox won a bidding battle for 18­game loser Matt Young at baseball's winter meetings. 
A Bay area trade that moved Ernest Riles to Oakland, a lesser deal that sent Dave Gallagher to California, a contract extension for Steve Sax and ail-day meetings between Vince Coleman and the Mets punctuated another active day. 
Off the field, there was action, too. National League owners met to maybe talk about expansion while American League owners met with elimi­nation of the designated hitter as a possible topic. 
Free agents still were the frenzy, and again the free­spending Giants led the way. They turned up the effort to get Righetti, and quickly moved into the best position to lure the northern California native back home from New York. 
The Giants already have spent $13 million for Willie McGee and $10 million for Bud Black this winter, and it could cost them about $8 million for three years to land the left-handed reliever. Oakland also entered the sweepstakes and so did Minnesota. but there was a chance to Twins might have to settle for Steve Bedrosian, who could become available if San Francisco gets it main man. 
Righetti, 32, saved 36 games last season and is the Yankees' all-time leader. But New York has offered just $2.1 million per year and besides, Righetti's preference is the Giants. 
Sax, Righetti's teammate for two seasons, will be staying with the Yankees. The second baseman, who had one year left on his contract, signed an ex­tension through 1995 for $12.4 million. 
"Steve loves New York," said Adam Katz, one of Sax's agents. "He's not one of those guys who wants to leave." 
Young, like Righetti, has been a starter and reliever in his ca­reer. Unlike Righetti, Young does not have a lifetime win­ning record-51-78, including son for Seattle. 
But these days, even if the pitching numbers are not good, the dollar numbers .are -par­ticularly for a left-bander. The Red Sox offered Young a three­year, $6.35 million contract, and that was a little more than Detroit and Baltimore wanted to pay. 
"We are thrilled to have Matt Young, and we see him as an important member of our starting rotation next season," Boston general manager Lou Gorman said. "He has a great arm, and we believe that he can be a winner on a contending ballclub." 
Young, 32, missed most of 1988 and 1989 with elbow trouble, but pitched 225 innings last season. He made 33 starts and had seven complete games. 
Dan Schatzeder, 36, made out pretty well, too. The lefty re­liever got $700,000 from Kansas City for one year, this after going 1-3 for Houston and the New York Mets. 
The Giants and Oakland each got what they wanted in a trade for reserves. San Francisco sent utility infielder Ernest Riles to the Athletics for promising outfielder Darren Lewis and a player to be named later. 
Riles, 30, hit .200 in 92 games last season. He is a .264 life­time hitter in six seasons, mostly with Milwaukee. 
"We've been looking for a left­handed hitting infielder with some versatility for several years," Athletics general manager Sandy Alderson said. "We've talked to the Giants about Ernest Riles quite a few times over the years." Lewis, 23, batted .229 in 25 games for Oakland. He has been a .300 hitter throughout his minor league career. 
The trade came a day after each team signed prominent free-agent center fielders ­McGee by the Giants and Willie Wilson by Oakland. 
Early in the day, Baltimore made its first move of the

meetings, trading Gallagher to the Angels for two minor lea­guers. Gallagher, 30, played for the Chicago White Sox and the Orioles last season and batted .254. 
The Orioles got two pitchers, 27 -year-old David Martinez and 22-year-old Mike Hook. 
Later in the afternoon, NL owners held a league meeting and expansion may have been on the agenda. No official an­nouncement is expected until after the meetings on what ci­ties are on the "short list," although the topic might come up. 
In the AL meetings, the DH was due to be discussed. Commissioner Fay Vincent said during the World Series that he thought there might be enough support among owners to elim­inate the DH.

coupled with a tendency to drive to the basket, present a unique challenge for the Saint Mary's defense. 
"We will have to have a team effort on defense to stop their guard," said sophomore Julie Snyder. "She is their best player. We must also be patient on offense and take time to set up our plays. Their defense will break down." 
Senior Mea Tettenborn expects Saint Mary's to run against the slower Calvin College defense. "We've been working on our half-court offense this week," she said, "but if the fast break is there, we'll go with it. We just came off a tough loss. We want to beat Calvin College."

ND swimming programs need to write a new plan 
Irish swimming coach Tim Welsh is sitting in his office in the Rolfs Aquatic Center, trying to explain the goals of his program. Through the wall-sized window in his office, he can see and hear water aerobicizers moving to the beat of a spruced-up version of "Tequila." 
But through that window he can also see in the Rolfs pool a metaphorical 747 jet, which he and Athletic Director Dick Rosenthal like to invoke when talking about the Notre Dame swimming program. 
"This is a.world-class pool and we know it," says Welsh in his desk chair, gesturing out to the mon­strous body of water that constitutes the main part of Rolfs Aquatic Center. "If we have a world-class pool and a world-class university, why not fill it with world-class athletes? 
"It's like Mr. Rosenthal's metaphor: We've got a 747 on the runway, so we should put enough gas in it so it can take off." 
In the last year, the gas transport facilities have been mobilizing quickly and the swimming program is on its way to becoming nationally competitive. Just this past weekend, both the men's and women's teams won the National Catholic Championships. It was the first time both teams had won in the same year. 

"The fact that we were able to win it is a fulfillment of a dream," says Welsh. "It also gives us the confidence to say that the progress is going well, that we're moving in the right direction and that our aspirations of a national championship is appropri­ate." 
Hold it there. There's a difference between winning the National Catholics and winning the NCAA Championships. Welsh's point, however, is that the recent accomplishment is one more bag of asphalt in building the road to a national championship. More bags of asphalt: 
Sophomore 
Tanya Williams and senior Becky Wood both competed in the national championships last season, the first time Notre Dame swimmers had participated in that tournament. 

The 
women's team is receiving two additional scholarships each year until it reaches "eight to ten," according to Welsh. 

Last 
weekend alone, the two teams set 21 university records. The swimmers are setting university records so quickly that Welsh says, "We're very close to having every one of our university records re-set during 1990." 

The 
Rolfs Center enables Welsh to recruit "world­class" athletes because of the quality of its facilities. 


Currently, Welsh says, he is talking to "a couple" people who are world-ranked. 
True, the swimming teams have not had scholar­ships in the past, so it is natural that scholarship athletes will break existing records. But the men's team still is basically a non-scholarship program, and the women's has only one full scholarship. And they're breaking records that they've previously broken this year. 
"This has been done by people who have improved while at Notre Dame, and that helps us establish na­tional credibility," says Welsh. One such person who has seen the program grow is Brian Rini. A senior specializing in the freestyle and butterfly, Rini holds three individual university records and one relay record.
