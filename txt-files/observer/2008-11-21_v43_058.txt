Leaders discuss building credibility 
Panelists argue Central American democracies risk losing structure in face of problems 
ByJOHN TIERNEY News Writer 
Panelists participating in a Kellogg Institute-sponsored discussion of "The Future of Democracy in Central America" agreed Central American democracies risk losing their governmental structure if they do not do something to improve their credibility. 
Building credibility in gov­ernment is not something that can be achieved instantly, according to panelist Ricardo Maduro Joest, who was presi­dent of Honduras from 2002 to 2006. 
During his presidency, he 
fought frequently with the nation's teachers in his quest to improve the nation's edu­cation. In negotiations with the teachers, Maduro said that "more often than not, we had to go find Cardinal Rodriguez" to verify the fair­ness of an agreement "because they didn't believe in anyone else." 
"Who can we believe in? What can we fall back on?" are some of the questions that people ask when they feel that their government is not trustworthy, according to Maduro.

Syracuse game to be sustainable 
Contest will be first carbon neutral event 
By AARON STEINER 
News Writer 

Notre Dame is bringing a green theme to one of its most treasured traditions -a football Saturday. This weekend's football game will be the University's first ever car­bon neutral game. 
"There are various aspects of the game that produce carbon emissions," Rachel Novick, educa­tion and outreach coordinator at the Office of Sustainability, said. She said things like lighting, fan travel and gameday waste are examples of activities that pro­duce carbon emissions. 
This weekend, the Office of Sustainability will make the game carbon neutral by using efficiency projects that reduce carbon emis­sions to offset the emissions nor­mally produced at a game. 
Various projects throughout the year have increased efficiency and reduced carbon emissions, and those reductions will be allocated towards making the game carbon neutral. 
Novick cited the student-initiat­ed gameday recycling project as a major contributor to reducing car­bon emissions. 
"Recycling really saves a lot of energy," she said. "Probably the most extreme case is that of an aluminum can." 
It takes 95 percent more energy to make a new aluminum can ­

final home game 

By IRENA ZAJICKOVA 
News Writer 
Tomorrow's matchup against Syracuse marks the last home game of the 2008 football season, leading Notre Dame's senior to reflect on their time at the University. 
Senior Laura Schwartz said most seniors would consider the 2005 game against USC the best they saw while sitting in the stu­dent section. 
"You'd be hard pressed to fmd a senior who doesn't say the USC game," senior Laura Schwartz said, referring to when USC defeated the Fighting Irish after

Senior Jimmy Champlin agreed about the USC game, adding he was one of the students who pre­maturely rushed the field. 
"USC got the touchdown, but by that time I was already twenty rows down headed for the field," Champlin said. 
When how he felt about the end of his final football season, Champlin said he felt sad. 
"It's pretty nostalgic and a little sad," Champlin said. "But I real­ize that part of what makes a game in the student section spe­cial is the knowledge that you only have a few."

Christmas 

too soon 
I love Christmas. I mean, who doesn't? Jlowever, I love Thanksgiving more and it makes me sad that it has become Christmas season halftime. Christmas songs have already taken over the radio, Christmas show are beginning to play on the television, and we have all 
Ashley Charnley 
seen the holiday aisles in the stores. So, when did this News Production happen? It confuses Editor me how every year people complain about the early onslaught of Christmas, yet every year it comes sooner and soon­er. 
I think the first, and most annoying of 
the early holiday strikes, is the music. 
There are already whole stations devot­
ed to the cheery tunes. Christmas music, 
no matter how happy it makes me, gets 
old. Too much of anything is not good, 
and the three and a half weeks after 
Thanksgiving can even be too much. I 
put on Perry Como as I help my family 
decorate the tree, and of course "Red 
Baron" will randomly play on my iPod. I 
can even take it all day Christmas Eve, 
but to hear Jingle Bells before the 
turkey hits the table is just too much for 
me. 
My next grievance with the early attack of Christmas decor is the holiday items that go up in the stores as soon as Halloween costumes are taken down. As a matter of fact. I was shopping for a costume and I ran into three aisles of outdoor Christmas lights. I couldn't believe it. We all complain every year that Santa Claus starts popping up soon­er and sooner, but every year I hold out hope that there has to be a limit. Clearly, stores want to make as much money as possible, but how much of these things are they really selling in Oetober? I don't know what worries me more, the fact that they think we will buy deeorations so early, or that we actually are buying them and that is why they are already out. 
Lastly, are Christmas commercials. They infiltrate the networks earlier and earlier each year, not to be outdone by their fellow mndiums. Advertising com­panies solicit us to subdue our selfish buying habits, and buy presents for oth­ers instead. Making needless items nee­essary for our family and friends. What other time of the year do we spend a vast portion of our money to buy things that we aren't really sure people will like and that will often be returned? I love presents, but I prefer the ones that have thought put into them more than money. Then again, that probably stems from my poor college student budget. Most of my family and friends will be getting smiles and hugs from me come Deeember. 
Please don't misunderstand, however, as I said, I love Christmas. But I love it most because of its uniqueness. It only comes once a year and that makes it special. People are thinking of others, making time to spend with each other, and in general happy with Christmas eheer. I just don't want the novelty of Christmas to wear off before the day even gets here.

Crafts sale helps developing nations 
Local fair trade store selling goods from artisans all around the world 
By SARAH MAYER 
News Writer 

If you're looking to get ahead on your Christmas shopping and support a good cause in the process, stop by O'Shaughnessy Hall, where fairly traded crafts made by artisans in developing nations are being sold from 9 a.m. to 
4:30 p.m. today. 

Ten Thousand Villages, a local fair trade store, works with 66,000 artisans from 36 different countries, said assis­tant manager Cheryl Schairer, creating a "long-term relation­ship" with artisans so that they can have a sustainable income to provide for their families. 
Schairer said Ten Thousand Villages is unique in that they pay artisans fair wages before their products are sold, and then "it's up to us to sell it." 
"Unlike most other compa­nies that send money back if [the products] sell," she said. 
Ten Thousand Villages is selling its products in honor of International Student Week, including a tea light made by industrial design professor Ann-Marie Conrado.

Jewelry has been one of the best sellers at Notre Dame, assistant manager Cheryl Schairer said.

Copernicus' remains found in Poland 
WARSAW -Researchers said Thursday they have identified the remains of Nicolaus Copernicus by comparing DNA from a skele­ton and hair retrieved from one of the 16th­century astronomer's books. 
The findings could put an end to centuries of speculation about the exact resting spot of Copernicus, a priest and astronomer whose theories identified the Sun, not the Earth, as the center of the universe. 
Polish archaeologist Jerzy Gassowski told a news conference that forensic facial recon­struction of the skull, missing the lower jaw, his team found in 2005 buried in a Roman Catholic Cathedral in Frombork, Poland, bears striking resemblance to existing por­traits of Copernicus. 
The reconstruction shows a broken nose and other features that resemble a self-por­trait of Copernicus, and the skull bears a cut mark above the left eye that corresponds with a scar shown in the painting.

British Ambassador John Sawers said the 15-nation council wants to help contributing nations "as best we can in getting troops on the ground rapidly" once they decide to help

"Exactly how many weeks it will be, it's not clear. But this is a matter of urgency," Sawers said.

tion with citizen's inability to trust a democratic govern­ment that he felt was trust­worthy. 
"The fact is, you don't build credible institutions overnight," Maduro said. "You need to change certain things for a long time and create credible institutions." 
Nicaraguan ambassador to the United States Arturo Cruz said credibility is a major problem in Central American democracies. lie attributes much of this to the govern­ment's inability to balance meeting people's immediate needs and planning for the future. 
"Sometimes, I wonder how you govern a type of society that is always overwhelmed by the need of the people," Cruz said. "There's a funda­mental problem with promis­ing the future and not deal­Rica." 
Because the governments are weak and take advantage of the people, according to Solis, the entire system of democracy is called into ques­tion. 
"Will the governance weak­nesses continue to be blamed on the institutions of democ­racy?" he asked. 
He cited corrupt courts and legislatures, along with ineffi­cient government programs overall, as a bulk of the prob­lem. 
"They have weakened democracy," Solis said. "Costa Rica is the worst case. More people think it would be bet­ter to have a dictatorship because some people have talked against the very insti­tutions of democracy." 
In spite of all the corrup­tion, the panelists agree that there is hope for Central American democracies. 
Solis attributes this hope a predicted return of "more pragmatic policies" under the incoming administration

Cruz said that the best way to deal with this problem is by what lw eaiiMI "responsi­ble or measured populism." 
"That was my hope. a hope that withers away every day," Cruz said. 
Olton Solis, a former presi­dential candidate of the Citizens Action Party in Costa Hica, attributes much of his eountry's problems to the negative impacts of free trade agreements. 
These agremncnts, accord­ing to Cruz, neglected "inward oriented consensus building," while instead pur­suing "outward secret pacts, like in the case of Structural Adjustment and CAF'IA" 
Solis also denounced cor­rupt govcrnnwntal policies. "Deecntralization of power and tlw elimination of pop­ulist practices" arc areas in which better policies are nec­~~ssary, according to Solis. 
"People are usnd," he said. "Perhaps the worst country. in this is my own country, Costa

Central American democra­cy has also not been without succnss, according to Cruz. 
"We have finally had -my God, espeeially in my country -some level of peace," Cruz said. 
"We're also having great statistics when it comes to crime," he said. 
A third achievement of the Nicaraguan democracy is the electorate system, but that electorate system could begin to become problematic, according to Cruz. 
"Since 1990, Nicaragua has realized that we can change governmnnt without killing or dying," he said. 
Similar participation in the democratic system is essential in Honduras, according to Maduro. 
"What can keep us from extremns'? The only way to do 
it  is  to  delegate  more,"  
Maduro said.  
Under  the  current  

Honduran government, Maduro said that citizens are seared to participate in democracy. 
"Now we're being persecut­nd if we have an opinion against the government," he said. "llow do we get back so people are willing to partiei­pate?"

should be a top priority. Last week, advisors to Obama told the Associated Press that dos­ing the prison is, in fact, a top priority of the incoming presi­dent. 
The detention of approxi­mately 250 people at Guantanamo Bay has negative­ly affected the "national image" of the United States, McKinney said, an image Obama can begin to repair if he shuts down the detention center. 
"We need to make sure that we've got a very secure image in a global perception so that we are not discredited, because if we start criticizing a country for its human rights practices and abuses, then it's thrown back at us," she said. 
Professor Mary Ellen O'Connell, a Notre Dame pro­fessor of international law and a specialist on the law of war, said keeping Guantanamo Bay open would weaken President­elect Obama's position on the world stage, especially at a time when the United States is negotiating with other coun­tries about how to solve the global financial crisis. 
'If he immediately takes away big, glaring examples of violations of international law, namely Guantanamo, then all of a sudden, the powers of the world, with whom we are negotiating, say 'this is a man we can trust,"' she said. "That's why I think he can't wait on Guantanamo Bay." 
Obama stated during his campaign that he wants to close the detention center, and although his advisors are now increasing discussion about shutting down the facility, the details of the fates of the approximately 250 detainees at Guantanamo Bay are still unclear, the Associated Press report said last week. 
The new Obama administra­tion must respect international law when planning for the clo­sure of Guantanamo Bay, O'Connell said, specifically cit­ing the Geneva Convention, which cover most of the detainees. 
The two prisoners who were detained as teenagers should be repatriated to their home countries immediately, she said, and the United States should also begin negotiations to return persons not accused of any crimes to their home countries. 
For those prisoners for whom evidence suggests they had been involved in planning ter­rorist attacks, O'Connell said they may lawfully be tried before regular federal courts with criminal jurisdiction in the United States. Many other prisoners should be returned to Afghanistan to be detained until the end of hostilities there or face trial, if there is evi­dence they have committed crimes, she said. 
O'Connell stressed that the United States should now and should always have followed the law in place at the time and not create new courts for per­sons already in detention. The idea of new security courts is one that has been floated by Obama advisors in Associated Press reports. 
The creation of new courts is something Obama needs to stay away from, O'Connell said, because it would violate the Geneva Conventions. 
"You can't go around creat­ing new courts for the purpos­es of the people you don't like," she said. 

While the exact details of a Guantanamo Bay shutdown remain unclear, O'Connell said she is "confident" that Obama will close the detention center as president. 
McKinney agreed that her ideal -that Guantanamo Bay closes in Obama's first term ­is realistic. 
"I would like to think that in four years you can process, in our judicial system, 270 prison­ers and figure out a just system for them," she said. 
Human Rights-NO is consid­ering sending people to Washington, D.C. in .January to join Witness Against Torture, a campaign to shut down Guantanamo, in kicking off its planned 100-day presence in front of the White House. 
"If we don't send people to D.C.," McKinney said, "then we are going to be doing a lot of campaigns here to make sure human rights, specifically Guantanamo Bay, but all human rights, are made a pri­ority and words turned into action."

IN BRIEF Black Friday sales may disappoint 
NEW YORK -After pushing steep discounts throughout November that are usually reserved for the day after Thanksgiving, retailers from Kohl's to Toys "R" Us are offering even bigger cuts and promotions for Black Friday in a fran­tic bid to pull in shoppers. 
But the bargain hunters showing up for the early morning specials on toys and TVs are not expected to buy with the same gusto as a year ago, as they fret about tightening credit, mas­sive layoffs and shrinking retirement funds. 
Not to mention that consumers are already jaded by all those "60 percent off'' signs plas­tered on storefronts. Analysts say shoppers may stick to smaller gifts like cosmetics rather than $1,000 flat-panel TVs in a holiday season expected to be the weakest in decades. 
Another concern? There aren't any must­have items so far, even in toys -though some items have been popular, such as Spin Master Ltd.'s Bakugan. 
Congress aims for "greener'' legislation 
WASHINGTON -Democrats steered the House toward more aggressively tackling global warming and other environmental problems Thursday, toppling veteran Michigan Rep. John Dingell, a staunch supporter of Detroit automak­ers, from an important energy panel in favor of California liberal Rep. Henry Waxman. 
The switch could help President-elect Barack Obama on Capitol Hill with one of his favored issues: trying to curb global warming by limiting greenhouse gas emissions. But Waxman's com­bative stance on climate change and other issues also could alienate Republicans and moderate Democrats, making it harder to get the biparti­san support Obama will need. 
Waxman is an avid environmentalist and booster of health care programs -and a home­state ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. He defeated Dingell on a 137-12 2 vote in the Democratic Party caucus, capping a bruising intraparty fight. 
The Energy and Commerce panel is one of the most important House committees, with sweep­ing jurisdiction over energy, the environment, consumer protection, telecommunications and health care programs such as Medicaid and the popular State Children's Health Insurance Program.

"Aluminum cans are a big per­centago of the matoria.ls that are used at tailgates," Novick said. "By getting all that into recycling, we're having a big impact." 
Novick said projects like Sunday evening's energy audits and light bulb exchange also help to reduce emissions and improve eftieiency. 
"Thus far we've exchanged 4,400 light bulbs in residence hall<;," she said. "We did an audit of dorm rooms, and we collected a lot of information about ther­mostat<; that don't work, rooms that overheat, windows that don't close. The maintenance staff on campus is now going to follow up on those reporl<;." 

Building renovation projects will also improve efficiency, she said. 
The concept of a completely green football game was first suggested by NBC, Novick said. NBC has a eontract to broadcast all Notre Dame home games. 
"They contacted us because they have an annual Green Week where they do all kind<; of envi­ronmental programming as part of their national broadcasts ... so they wanted to highlight some of the sustainability programs at Notre Dame and also Syracuse," Novick said. 
NBC also decided to host a contest on the Web site Carbon Rally. 
"The idea is to challenge the two schools to see how many they can get to commit to more ceo-friendly lifestyles," Novick said. 
The contest runs until the end of November, and the winning school receives $10,000 to be used for sustainable initiatives. 
Novick said the football game broadcast would feature various initiatives on Notre Dame's cam­pus, including gameday recy­cling. 
In addition, NBC sponsored an ad competition between Notre Dame and Syracuse. Students from both schools submitted 30­second films about sustainability issues, and the winning ad will be featured on the NBC Web site.

said. "It's a chance for the stu­dents to create, in partnership with the Logan Center, an event and a display of art." 
Joshua said the project allowed her students to see the importance art plays in the lives of people with disabilities. 
"It's a student project investi­gating how art impacts the lives of people with disabili­ties," she said. "What I wanted the students to do was to assume the idea of inclusive art in the context of the Logan Center. The idea was to put people with disabilities behind the cameras as well as in front of the cameras." 
Logan Center community­based learning coordinator Nichole Maguire originally sug­gested the idea for the art show. 
"I geared them towards doing an art show because it's really cool to see the artwork for our clients and how they express themselves," Maguire said. "It's visually stimulating for the clients and it's also just fun. I like the idea of giving them a blank slate ... that way they can really be creative and express themselves." 
Sophomore Jason Deska, who is a student in the seminar, said the project allowed the stu­dents to closely interact with the clients and was mutually rewarding. 
"Once we started talking to the clients and saw how excit­ed they were for it we knew it was definitely a good idea," he said. 
Deska said he was often sur­prised by how many of the pho­tographs were of high quality, and he said it was hard to decide which images were the best. 
"There was one role where there was only one picture that was even usable, but there were some where it was hard to single out one as the best," he said. 
Sophomore Casey Larkin said she was surprised by the cre­ativity of some of the clients she worked with, who took pic­tures around the Logan Center with disposable cameras. 
"We just kind of wandered around Logan Center and told them to take pictures of any­body and anything they want­ed," Larkin said. "It was a lot of fun. I did not expect the art to come out as well as it did." 
Larkin said some of the clients had amazing artistic vision and were able to find amazing pictures. 
"They had better eyes than I did. There were some where I was thinking, 'Why would you take a picture of that?' And they you see it and you think, 'Oh my goodness,"' she said. 
Joshua said it was important for her students to become integrated into the work of the Logan Center clients, and the project helped teach them many valuable lessons about working with people with dis­abilities. 
"The clients at the Logan Center did their own composi­tions and they've been going through classes learning how to hold cameras, and I think students were excited to be involved in that because it's a service placement and they're learning about the mechanics of charitable organizations and project management," she said.

"I think we will win," Gaines said. "Hopefully winning will give us a better chance of going to a bowl game." 
Gaines, who works for Notre Dame's recruiting department, has had some unique memories over the years thanks to her job. 
"My favorite was seeing Notre Dame students doing push-ups with recruits five times their size," Gaines said. 
For Schwartz, a highlight of the game will be seeing all of the sen­ior football players getting a chance to play. 
''I'm really excited that it's sen­ior day," Schwartz said. "It'll be fun to see my classmates get a chance to contribute to the game." 
Champlin is excited for the marshmallow fights that take place in the senior section during the final home game. 
"I just want to let the ushers know that if they do see me throwing marshmallows I'm just returning them to their rightful owners," Champlin joked. "Please don't throw me out. I'd probably start crying and make a scene." 
Gaines will miss the end of foot­ball games in the student section. 
"Notre Dame football has become such a part of our lives here and it's going to be really weird not having it in our lives," Gaines said. 
Syracuse, who is 2-8 this sea­son, is coming into the game otT a 39-14 loss to Connecticut. In addi­tion, Syracuse recently fired head coach Greg Robinson. However, he will finish out the season before stepping down. 
The game kicks otT tomorrow at

1 Last Lecture' a success, could use more space 
Notre Dame students are often called apathetic when it comes to their awareness of the goings-on on their cam­pus and in the world. Talk of "the bubble" aside, students on this campus are busy people with busy lives, and that preoccupation can translate to a lack of involvement on the part of those students when it comes to campus organizations or events. 
Without dwelling too much on the stereotype, it's safe to say that it's an ongoing task for those plan­ning these campus events to get students involved. 
Which is why Bob Reish, Grant Schmidt, OBSERVER more intimate setting for the lecture, an idea the Academic Affairs Committee and which has merit. However, with the high level of Student Government deserve praise for the attendance, it was impractical and cramped.
Editorial 
polling and surveys, one name repeatedly came up: Professor McKenna, the University's Edmund P. Joyce 
C.S.C. chair in Anthropology and an expert in mother­child co-sleeping and primate behavior. 
This feeling was reflected in the high attendance at McKenna's "Last Lecture" on Nov. 12. Students crammed into the Coleman-Morse lounge, most standing and crouching to see and hear McKenna's lecture. Some stu­
dents were unable to stay and listen, due to a lack of space. The choice in venue would have encouraged a 
very successful beginning to their "Last Lecture" series, a featured lecture by Anthropology professor James McKenna. 
The "Last Lecture" concept -asking professors and faculty to give a hypothetical final lecture on what mat­ters most to them -is not new. It garnered nationwide attention in 2007 when Randy Pausch, a professor of com­puter science and design at Carnegie Mellon, gave a simi­lar lecture titled "Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams." Pausch had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer a year prior, and his message and lecture have since been published and inspired a nationwide audience. 
This year, the Reish-Schmidt administration decided to bring the Last Lecture series to Notre Dame. Through Student Government should be encouraged 
for the stellar attendance levels at the first event in the "Last Lecture" series. It's clear proof that no matter how apathetic students may appear to be, their attention can be successfully grabbed by compelling events and speakers. Planning the lecture series took ini­tiative and creativity, and that spirit should continue in other Student Government efforts as the academic year continues. 
We also want to encourage the student body to continue to support the efforts of Student Government by attending these types of events when they're offered each semester. The best way to break the apathetic stereotype is to pop the bubble yourselves.

Giving thanks for the cathedral steps 
On any evening in Washington, D.C., should you walk a few blocks north of th!~ White Ilouse past the Cathedral of St. Matthnw, you may notice a lump inconspic­uously tucknd away to the right of the main doors on the top of tho cathedral steps. At times, ospodally after sundown, it is dillicult to see sinco thn lump blends into the shadows of thn nvening. During the summer, the lump takes on the outlinn of a cardboard square-or if it is raining, a largo black open umbrella. Other times, including now with subzero-deJ.,rree weather, the lump is complntnly wrapped in a black sleeping bag. 
!laving served as a lector at St. Matthew's Cathedral for nearly two decades, I cannot recall a time when the lump was not at the top of our catl1edral steps. While last Sunday our priest rnmind­nd us that cathedrals wnre made so that the homnless can meet the con~-,rregation, I did not obviously think of the woman who lbrms that daily lump. Yet, fi>r some unknown reason this year, I regularly think of her, and especially now as we approach Thanksgiving week. Does she give thanks for anything other than the reliable step upon which she seeks her nightly solace? 

To sec the woman in person, the average visitor at the cathedral would not know that she was homeless. She is tall and car­ries herself in a stoic manner. Her dothes are clean. Her makeup in1maculately applied with bright red lips. She always wears a black dress, and her black hair is pullnd back but has a large white streak which reminds me of the bride of Frankenstein. Most noticeably, though, her constant padng on the top step or inside the cathedral reveals some personal wwasiness. 
Whilo I do not know her name, she assists the staff whenever the cathedral is open. She will replace the booklets in the pew holders and evenly stack the books at the main entrance. When I directly pass her, she nods slowly without saying a word. I oftentimes watch her walk past my home which is located four blocks from the cathedral. I imagine that she uses some facility nearby to groom herself, but I am at a loss to discover where that may be. 
Hecently, I thought of her while I ate din­ner at the Democratic Club located next door to the Democratic National Committee Headquarters building. It was karaoke evening when several talented congres­sional staff and a few congressional wives belted out tunes to the cheers and applause of the crowd. Television commentator Donna Brazil and campaign wizard Joe Trippi were among several congressional representatives and a European ambassa­dor who were enjoying the amateur enter­tainment. Surely, none of them were ever curled up in a lump at the top of cathedral stairs. 

Yet while sitting amidst these seemingly carefree, materially wealthy and nationally famous personalities, it struck me that everyone needs some type of safe place in life. I wondered to myself how many of the people around me are in reality an Ebenezer Scrooge whose life revolves around the security of a dollar. With all of the status and power in the room, I also imagined how many egos teetered simply on the number of votes cast during an elec­tion. 
For my entire adult life, Thanksgiving has always been a trip over the Potomac River and through the woods of Southwestern Pennsylvania to be home with family. For most who attended karaoke night, that is considered the ulti­mate Thanksgiving. But with my parents now both passed on, my dog, Peso, and I will remain in the nation's capital next week. My only scheduled event is a tour of the White House for one last glimps!~ of the Oval Ollice before the new president redec­orates. It is a time killer like the Notro Dame -USC game will be the previous day. 
Thanksgiving this year is not about boun­ty, friends or family for me. This year, Thanksgiving will be my own -a personal experience replete with introspection and solace. Ironically, I will think about how in many ways the lump at the top of the cathedral steps is an extremely lucky one. And in my mind, I will search for my own private set of cathedral stairs upon which I can find the comfort and stability that rep­resents a meaningful Thanksgiving holiday. To all in the Notre Dame community and beyond, the best of holiday wishes from Peso and me.

Dueling pianos and Catholic identity 

This p<L'>t wnnkend, I attended the "Dueling Pianos" night at Legends. Thn music was rathnr enjoyablo save for one song. Due to numerous requests from tho studenl">, the performers decided to play a song by Tenacious D entitlnd "F**k I Ier Gently" (this is how iTunes writes the title. Tenadous Dis more explicit). Many of you may know this song, but fi>r those who do not, il"> eontent live up to il"> title. 
Nnndlnss to say, this song completely degrades human sexuality and goes against Catholic teaching on this subject. Although the performers decided that tl1ey would play thn song but sing only "95 percent of the lyrics," they encouraged the student<> to lill in the blanks aloud. Nonetheless, the message of thn song was heard loud and dear. 
I cannot help but feel that this is a perfect opportunity for the University to step up and defend its Catholic identity. As much as I enjoyed the rest of the show, the University should take a stand and stop allowing garbage like this to occur at Our Lady's University. Make an example of tl1is group. Do not invite them back to campus. At the very lnast, inf(>rm them and other artists that come to perform here that songs like this should not be part of their performance. I firmly believe that Our Lady, Our lloly Father and Our Lord would not approve of such songs. 
Notre Dame eontinues to daim to be the "Great Catholic University." It's about time to start showing it.

Have patience -with Weis 
While I understand that Notre Dame fans are very impatient when it comes to head coaches, l believe that many fans (Iacovo and Sullivan, "Weis Accountable," Nov. 18, included) are miss­ing the point when it comes to Weis' job. 
We have all heard the complaints about the record against teams with winning records. We have all heard the complaints about our team's lack of a "signature game." What students and fans like Iacovo and Sullivan fail to realize is that the process of building a football team can be painful and slow. 
Iacovo and Sullivan bring up several instances where they question Weis' decisions. Let me be the first to say that I absolutely hate the Wildcat offense. However, if Weis decides to run a play from this formation, who would you rather have with the ball besides Tate? He is one of the fastest players on the team and its pretty obvious that the player taking the snap isn't supposed to be a real passing threat. That's why defenses are taught to stop the run first in that formation. Suggesting that Tate has to be a good passer in order to run that formation is ridiculous. Any pass made from the formation would only work if the receiver is wide open. 
Secondly, Weis took out his starters because he wanted to respect Navy as well as give his younger players some real game experience. I agree that it happened a little too early, but his motive was correct. His gamble to run a play on fourth down was in an eflort to not let Navy have the ball back. Ifwe got a first down on that play, the game was over. 
As for the example where you bring up about the Sugar Bowl and faking a punt, Weis knew that we were pretty big underdogs in that game. A fake punt is the type of play where if it suc­ceeds, it completely changes the game in our favor and he was looking for any sort of upper hand that he could find. 
What this issue comes down to is that our foot­ball team needs to show improvement, and it has. Our team has scored over eight more points per game this season than last while allowing eight fewer per game. Our running game has increased 50 yards per game while giving up 60 fewer yards per game. We're passing for almost 80 more yards per game than last year. In total offense, we've increased by 130 yards per game. Our sacks have dropped from 58 last year to 14 this year. You might just dismiss these stats, but it shows remarkable improvement from last year. 
The issue of Charlie Weis comes down to rec­ognizing improvement and being patient with the system. You might not be happy because you're leaving at the end of this year and you want immediate results. Too bad, it won't happen. 
Last year we had very few upperclassmen that made a difference on the roster. This year we are still extremely young. Our top three receivers include two sophomores and one freshman. Our top two running backs are sophomores. Our quarterback is a sophomore. Where do you think the leadership is coming from? 
Results don't just happen when you have a very young team. We saw what Charlie could do when he has some upperclassman leadership. Wait until next year to judge Charlie's coaching job, and if he still isn't performing up to your standards, at that point you can daim to be dis­appointed. It is simply ridiculous to hold a coach to extremely high standards when he puts that young of a team on the field every week.

Salute the seniors 
As seniors here at Notre Dame, we have stood through 25 regular season football games, and rain or shine, win or lose, we have proudly supported our team. 
Our request is simple: that the football team recognize our commitment to them over the past four years by standing in front of the senior section for the Alma Mater at our last game as Notre Dame students. 
Thank you for making our experience here unforgettable.

LEITERS TO THE EDITOR 
Hooking-up norm.al 
What's with all the hate? It took guts for Melissa ("The hook-up culture," Nov. 19), to come out and talk about something that so many girl refuse to acknowledge: she's kissed a few boys. Most girls I know are so uptight about discussing anything even related to sex with a guy that it is a breath of fresh air to hear a girl admit that she's kissed some­one before, let alone yell it to the entire campus. If she had told me this personally, I would have given her a sassy z-snap and a "you go girl!" 
Too many guys have such an awful view of hooking-up: just because you kiss someone -or even do something more-doesn't mean you can't treat them like a person after­wards and at least be cordial, rather than running away like a little son of a ... 
Personally, I have tried to stay in contact with the girls I've hooked up: at the very least. I say "hi, how ya doing?" when I see them. However, I just have to say that although guys are pretty bad offenders at the whole not-making-the-next-time awkward thing, girls aren't perfect on this point by any stretch. 
Of the girls I've hooked-up with-or, probably more common, struck out with-there have definitely been more than a few that just refused to even seek something as simple as a friendly acquaintance. 
I remember the second week I was here, I kissed a girl on a bench. It was nothing too big, and I proceed to spend the rest of the night babysitting her "friend" -read drunk bull elephant-before walking her and the Baby Dee to a taxi. After multiple unre­sponded texts over the course of a week, I saw her again at Reekers. I talked to her a bit, and I walked with her and her friends to Blinky. She hasn't talked to me since, and that's not for my lack of trying. 
I think that Notre Dame has a huge problem with hookups: people take things way too seriously. College is a time when thousands of young singles-many of whom are just starting to explore their sexuality-live basically as next-door neighbors. Obviously, some sparks are going to fly; some start fires that burn, some for an hour (or if you're from Fisher. as long as she needs). 
People hooking-up is a healthy, natural part of life-don't swear off it, getjiggy with it -but that does not excuse disregarding people's feelings afterwards. Whether it is a guy or girl, no one enjoys another person avoiding them and pretending not to know them. It is true that most people who hook-up will not become b.f.f.s; however, a simple wave every once and a while never killed anyone. At least not yet. 
Declan Sullivan freshman Fisher Hall Nov. 20 

Hook-up a bad introduction 
Although I guess I should've been distraught upon learning that a fellow school­mate's (Melissa Buddie, "The hook-up culture," Nov. 19) method of making pals has been failing her consistently, my concern for her social life was nothing compared to my shock that nearly a semester had passed before she began to think that hooking up with random boys isn't a reliable way of establishing meaningful friendships at Notre Dame. 
Really? 
I know I'm not the only one who read the letter with a look on my face that was much more distaste than pity. However, it may be comforting to hear that it's not unnatural for her to be suffering the cold shoulder treatment from the partners of pre­vious hook-ups. It's standard fare. 
The hook-up culture she proudly practices typically implies a no-strings-attached attitude. That's supposed to be the entire appeal. 
So what's the big surprise? I don't blame those boys for being short on words after the act (I assume kissing was the extent of these six hook-ups, otherwise I would be writing another letter entirely), and I suspect that her very public announcement isn't going to make them any more eager to hang out with her. 
A rearrangement of priorities could prevent future problems. Dropping the "kissing hobby" is a good start. If Buddie is looking for a phone call or a lunch companion, I suggest that she makes friends with the boy(s) first and kisses second, if at all. 
That being said, I'm not sure that sharing Buddie's letter in the Viewpoint was any­thing short of Too Much Information for those of us who aren't a) among her six male addressees or b) also extremely baffled by why the people we're intimate with yet never intend to date feel awkward around us. Believe it or not, some of us college girls don't like to get our thrills by being the weekend conquest of a random dude. We'd prefer to read a piece that's a little more relevant and, dare I say, mature in nature. 
Just a thought.

In defense of Buddie 
After reading the barrage of letters defaming Melissa Buddie ("The hook-up cul­ture," Nov. 19) in yesterday's Viewpoint, I felt as though I would offer some words or encouragement. 
I-like Melissa-have made out with six guys this semester. I have not received 
much anticipated phone calls or lunch offers, not even the curious poke on facebook. 
And Melissa, if you think your lovely autumn strolls on South Quad are made awk­ward by your actions, eye contact with my former lovers is beyond awkward on so many levels. 
Stay Strong Melissa! (And Easy!) 
Sincerely, 
Dan Kuzma senior off-campus Nov. 20 


A product of the system 
Stop talking about Melissa ("The hook-up culture," Nov. 19), stop talking about Will ("Dear Jane(s)," Nov. 20). The supposed hook-up culture at Notre Dame is not created by men, nor fueled by women, but instead a product of the system we call the University of Notre Dame. Since it is the reverends and alumni that run the school we love so much, the buck stops at every one of their desks. It is on them to change the problems that are popping up at this University. 
Tradition is a wonderful thing, and helps Notre Dame boast at how storied it is; but there does come a time where you can be too steeped in tradition; and that time is now. I sit here three months into the school year and have no problem telling you that I still have not one legitimate girl friend like I did back home, and I know I'm not the only one. 
And this is not because I am the kid that sits in the corner of the classroom hop­ing his Jedi mind tricks will actually lift the pencil in the air for once. If you know me you know I'm not exactly a shy person. So what exactly are parietals and sin­gle-sex dorms doing? They're stopping exactly what we're longing for. 
Parietals are not stopping sex from happening, and are not making people do homework that they otherwise would not get done. Instead, they are preventing the casual movie watches, hang-outs, and friend-to-friend interaction that is absolutely necessary in a teenager's life. 
In order to fix the gender relations at Notre Dame, we need to do something about the single-sex dorms. like almost every other school out there (including other religious universities), our dorms should be single-sex by floor. This would fix a number of problems. Not only would it be extremely easy to meet girls by bump­ing ittto them but it would make it a thousand times more convenient to, God for­bid, hang out. We have so much schoolwork here that we only get miniscule breaks in-between homework. But even then, our breaks are spent playing video games or joking around with a same-sex friend down the hall. 
Instead, a new dorm system would allow me to walk down one flight of stairs to actually talk to a girl. While this is an enormous change from the system we have now, we can dull it down by starting with a choice. For example, over the summer the school could ask which housing you want, single-sex or multi-sex; and depend­ing on the results, some dorms would become multi-sex and some stay single-sex. Students would still stay in the same dorms for all four years to keep the amazing comradery we have now, except this would now include girls as well. 
The truth is, something needs to be done. But using the Letter to the Editor sec­tion in the Observer as an advertisement of how you're fun and up-for-anything is not productive at all. While ideas may seem radical to some, I'm sure the decision to admit women in the first place did too. 
P.S. -I lied earlier. I do in fact sometimes find myself wisqmg that the Jedi mind trick would work for me. 
Marko Pesce freshman Keenan Hall Nov. 20 


Another perspective 
Dear 23 girls I have hooked up with this semester, 
Thank you for the hook-up. It was ... spectacular, stimulating, mediocre, awful, mind-blowing, forgettable (is it 25?), awkward, heavenly, tricky, !icky, sticky, and all together a solid time. From my experience, it was the typical senior year post-Feve hook-up. 
Yes the hook-up itself was fine, but afterwards we've run into a problem. The problem isn't the dining hall, I'm a senior, I don't have a meal plan. It's the par­ties, in class, at bowling, Corby's, and Feve. It's the way you look at me, like you totally want it again. I want to scream, "Yes we did hookup once and I know I was great but there's no way you'll get that lucky again!" Other times we see each other and you totally eye me or you suddenly ditch the people you're with to throw yourself at me. To be fair, I think I may have been ignored by a few of you (actually that never happens, you all can't get enough). 
What about your number, did I ask for it just as a matter of course? Yes. But you had to request mine and now my thumb is getting tired silencing your calls. Is this your way of saying, "Thanks for the hook-up. It was the best thing I've ever experienced and I'll never be the same?" Get over me. How many of you have deleted my number? The answer is none of you because you treat my digits like the winning lottery numbers. 
Blame me for not calling you. I didn't break my phone and I haven't lost your numbers. I simply have no interest in seeing you again. If I do call, you know I am black out drunk looking for a booty call. Could we ever be friends? No. Ignoring you, apparently, is the only choice I have. 
Of course, I'm not blameless. You were the most convenient form of instant gratification I could fmd, hoodrats and dimes alike. I realize that but won't admit I am as guilty as you are. Stop knocking at my door at 1 a.m. begging to come in. Stop climbing in my window and lying in my bed hoping you'll get another shot. 
Even though I doubt you are willing to do this, I am sure of one thing: You 23 girls (25?) are not even close to where I draw the line. This weekend, and all weekends until I graduate, I will continue to add more conquests to my Excel spreadsheet. I will hook up with as many random girls as possible. Not because I am looking for a girlfriend or wife, but because I want to exploit your body. At Notre Dame, I am trying to get some play, and I'll never find a new hobby. Why should I? You still want it. Good thing I won't see you at the dining hall, I cook. 
Sincerely, 
Melissa Buddie's next hook-up 
P.S. don't worry about our (insert whatever we did together here), I'm clean, you didn't get it from me.

Keenan challenges dominant Siegfried 

Brothers Kelly lead Ra111blers 
By MOLLY SAMMON Sports Writer 
For most players and coaches, thn lnterhall Championship is just a ehanee to play a little competi­tivfl football, but for the three Kelly brothers. il'> a family aflhlr. 
A'> SinJ.,rf'ried's otlimsivn coordi­nator, coach Hob Kelly oversees both of his younger brothers, sen­ior team captain and tight end, Kevin, and sophomore defensive taekle, Patrick. 
"It is humbling," Hob Kelly said of eoaehing his younger siblings. "My first attempt at coaching was with 4-year-olds and I've found there are a lot of similarities between 4-year-olds and college studenl'>." 
Coincidentally, Siegfried's head coach, I'.J. Zimmer, asked Hob Kelly to help him out with coach­ing this sea.'ion, at the same time that the youngest brother, Patrick, a recent transfer from lloly Cross College, was pulled into Siegfried and decided to go out for the team as well. 

With both returning senior Kevin and newly-recruited Patrick trying out for the team, Hob found himself in a tough situ­ation. 
"I had to take myself out of that decision," Rob said. "[ certainly had a conflict ofinterest." 
But both made the team, and therefore, The Ramblers' Kelly Trio was formed. 
"The fact that [my coach] is my brother made it a little awkward at flfSt," Kevin Kelly said. "But he is really good at inspiring and being the devil's advocate on the team." 
Initially, Rob didn't share his brothers' enthusia.'im for football, but over time took to the sport. 
"I was more interested in schol­arly competitions in high school," Hob said. "I fell in love with foot­ball by the time I came to Notre Dame." 
As a member of the class of 2003, Rob graduated with a degree in aerospace engbrreering and management, and currently works at Notre Dame as the director of procurement services. 
But in offensive coordination, Rob found an area of football strategy where he had passion and expertise, despite never play­ing organized football. 
"Coach Zimmer is the real offensive architect, but I bring the critical eye," Rob said. "This is an aspect of football that I can really get myself into, the intellectual component." 
In contrast to their older broth­er, both Kevin and Patrick played together at Addison High School, a small public school in their southern Michigan town. 
"It was an island for me," said Kevin of being the trailblazer of the family's football participation. "All the team dinners and the summer practices, they were a new venture for me." 
The brothers all agree that having family members on cam­pus and alongside on the playing field changed their collegiate experiences for the better. 
"It's more relaxed now," Kevin said. "You always have someone to go to when you need some­thing." 
Quintessential of the Notre Dame culture of tradition in both family and football, Rob, Kevin, and Patrick will be representing both as the Interhall Championship game approaches this Sunday. 
"I left Notre Dame, but found my way back," Rob said. "I always find it providential that we ended up back here."

Siegfried featured in ESPN.com story

players for the story, including captain Kevin Kelly. Kelly said that he believes Darcy was inspired by the story of David Ruffer, a former Siegfried player who is now a kicker on the varsity team. 
After meeting with repre­sentatives from RecSports, Darcy wanted to focus on a particular team, and who bet­ter than the currently 6-0 Ramblers. 
"He got in contact with us and came out to our prac­tice," Kelly said.

"It's just not cool," Keenan captain Brett Wilps said. "He didn't even mention last year's champi­onship [where Keenan lost to rival Stanford]." 
The Knights have made the championship four of the past five years. but Darcy's article focused almost on the Ramblers. Wilps said he planned to use the story as motivation on Sunday. 
"I didn't realize only one team was playing in the championship," he said. "It's posterboard material for us. We're going to tack that up in the locker room."

for the exposure, and thought Darcy did a good job portray­ing interhall football's status at Notre Dame. 
"It was really cool and well­written," Kelly said. "I really appreciate how he did that for us."

David meets Goliath this Sunday as Keonan challenges Singl'ried for the Interhall Championship in legendary Notrn Dame Stadium. 
No. 7 seed Keenan has faced an uphill battle in the postsea­son but has emerged with con­vineing wins in each contest. J.iknwiso, No. 1 send Siegfried has lived up to the high expoc­tations, rolling past the compe­tition in pursuit of a pnrfeet sea­son. 
After reclaiming the Chapel last week in a 14-8 vietory over rival Stanford, Keenan captain Barton Dear is confident his team can build upon its success and carry the momentum into its third championship game in four years. 
"Beating Stanford was a huge achievement for us," Dear said. "Losing to our rival last year in the Stadium didn't sit well with us. We came out strong and played a great game against a gn~at team." 
The Knights have eome a long way from the beginning of the season to earn a spot in the championship. After beginning thn year 0-1-1, Dear said the tnam nnndnd to rediscover its identity and make some serious ehangns to turn the season around. 
"We realized that we had some players out of position," Dear said, "so we switched our quarterback to tight end and started a freshman in his place. 

The offensive line also worked 
some stuff out, and it translated 
into positive results on the 
field." 

Thrust into the offense as quarterback, freshman Terry Mahoney has thrived in a famil­iar role, leading the Knights to three victories. 
"I've had experience in the quarterback position before," Mahoney said. "I was ready since the beginning of the sea­son for a chance to play. I just had to wait for my opportunity. Thankfully I got it, and I've done my best for the team." 
Led by Mahoney, the balanced Keenan offense hopes to contin­ue moving the ball against a merciless Siegfried defense. Mahoney will try to establish a connection with senior wide receiver Jim Zenker, something he's been able to accomplish all season. 
"Any time I throw Jim the ball I know he's going to come down with it and make a play," Mahoney said. "The chemistry is there, we just need to exe­cute." 
Siegfried, however, has been effective in disrupting opposing offenses and preventing them from getting into a rhythm. Led by middle linebacker Dex Cure, the Ramblers forced three turnovers en route to a 14-6 victory over Morrissey in the semifinals last week. 
"We just keep things simple on both sides of the ball," Siegfried captain Kevin Kelly said. "As a team we're just going to keep doing what we've done all year: force turnovers and give our offense a chance to score." 
If the Ramblers maintain the same level of play they dis­played in the regular season, a championship is well within their reach, as the Ramblers are undefeated and untied through six games. Siegfried's success has even brought back memories to many of the leg­endary Dillon teams of the late SO's that dominated the inter­hall circuit. 
"I appreciate the responses, but we've still got one more game to go," Kelly said. "We can't lose focus and underesti­mate a good opponent. It's all about getting the job done in the Stadium." 
Kelly and the Siegfried seniors remember the last time they were on the Stadium field when USC ended a premature Irish celebration in 2005. They expect a much more enjoyable experience when they step on the field this Sunday. 
"I can't wait for it, and I know my teammates are just as excit­ed," Kelly said. "This will prob­ably be our last time on the field, and we want to remember it with a victory." 
The seniors from both teams agree that playing in the cham­pionship game will be the most meaningful four quarters in their careers. 
"If we win, it'll be a great ending to a hard-fought story over the last four years," Kelly said. 
But for Keenan senior Alex Gonzalez, Sunday's game will be a bitter-sweet experience.

Welsh Fam looks to stay perfect vs. McGlinn 
By RYAN O'CONNELL Sports Writer 
West Quad neighbors Welsh Family and McGlinn haven't played each other in more than three years, but the unfamiliari­ty will end Sunday when the teams face off in the Interhall Championship game. 
"We haven't played them since my freshman year," Welsh Fam senior captain Jenni Gargul a said. "We don't know what they look like as a team, but we never focus on who we play from week to 
week. We "This year, we've had a championship only focus on different experience in game."

This strate­however.

gy has "We have a worked well talented, bal­for the Jenni Gargula anced team this Whirlwinds. Welsh Fam captain year," Gargula after they've fallen behind. 
"Last year we basically killed every opponent we faced in the regular season and playoffs," Gargula said. "We'd never been behind until Cavanaugh scored first in the championship game. This year, we've had a different experience in that we've had a lot of close games. We've learned to score when the pres­sure is on. For example, we ended up coming back to beat Pasquerilla West when we were down by a touchdown with only a minute or so left. I definitely think those kind of games have helped prepare us for the 
who are cur­rently unde­feated. However, going unde­feated, at least in the regular season, is nothing new for Welsh Fam. 
"The past two years we've gone undefeated in the regular season," Gargul a said. "We lost last year in the stadium to Cavanaugh." 
The Whirlwinds believe, though, that their recent history of losing in the playoffs will change, as Gargula said the team has learned how to over­come adversity and win games said. "Both our 
offense and defense are great. Anyone on our team is capable of making a big play. As far as our passing game, we spread the ball around. No one receiver has caught most of the passes. Also, our secondary has made a lot of interceptions. All our players are talented and anyone is capable of making big play." 
McGlinn, on the other hand, overcame low expectations for the season to make it all the way to the championship. The Shamrocks, though. are not content with just what they've achieved so far. 
"We are so excited to be play­ing in Notre Dame Stadium, but with that being said, we are not just satisfied getting there; we want to win," McGlinn captain Sarah deGroot said. "This sea­son has been truly remarkable as no one expected us to make the playoffs or let alone make it to the stadium, but I had confi­dence in our team and knew that we had the players to make a run at a championship." 
Like Welsh Fam, the Shamrocks are also very strong on both sides of the ball. 
"Our offense has been great, especially at putting points up early in the game, and our defense has been lights out and played a near perfect game against Farley last week," de Groot said. "We have a lot of momentum going into Sunday's game and feel as though we are playing our best ball this year, and we will need to be on top of our game against a very good Welsh Fam team." 
McGlinn knows that they have a formidable opponent in Welsh Fam, so they're aiming on bringing their "A" game to the championship. 
"Welsh Fam comes into the game undefeated and has been playing some great ball, but so have we," de Groot said. "We are going to be the underdogs in this matchup, but we have been the underdogs all year and look where we have gotten so far."

After starting at quarter­back for four years, leading the way to three consecutive undefeated regular seasons, and to two Stadium appear­ances, Jenni Gargula has one goal left to attain. 
On Sunday, the Welsh Family Whirlwinds will look to Gargula for leadership as they have all season -and most of the past four -in an effort to finally win the Interhall Championship. 
Towards the end of her freshmen season, Gargula took over at quarterback for the Whirlwinds. Since then, Welsh Fam has not lost a reg­ular season game. Along the way, Gargula has pushed her­self to improve. 
"Jenni has learned a lot about the game," senior receiver Meghan Mulhern said. "She has always been

"I do feel pressure on myself [to win the championship]. I think a lot of that pressure I put on myself as well. I have really high standards for myself. I feel pressure in every game; I 
happy about it... 
The time nears for the pressure to produce the desired results for Gargula, and no one on the Whirlwind team is shy about the specificity of the desired results. 
"Our goal has been to not only get to the 
championship, but definitely to win," Mulhern said. 
"We know what it feels like to go into the Stadium and lose. We don't want that feel­ing again," Gargula said. "We're looking to end our careers on a high note and finally get that elusive cham­pionship, which has been our entire focus this year." 
When teammates old and new say things such as "We know what to expect of Jenni," and "Jenni is the cen­ter of our offense," as Mulhern and Baldasare, respectively, did, it is clear that Gargula will be the focus of both teams on Sunday. Yet, the most pressure she feels will be from within herself. She would have it no other way. 
"Our time is now," Gargula said. "Our goal is to win."

IN BRIEF Utley may miss opener
due to surgery in right hip 
PHILADELPHIA -Three-time All­Star Chase Utley, who anchored the middle of the lineup for the World Series champion Phillies, will have surgery and may not be ready for the start of the 2009 regular season. 
Utley will have surgery next week to repair any bone or cartilage dam­age he may have in his right hip. He will be able to begin baseball activity in three to four months. But depend­ing on the extent of the damage, full recovery could take until May, team officials said Thursday. 
"Our feeling is that he's going to be fairly close to ready if not ready by opening day," general manager Ruben Amaro Jr. said. "We fully expect to have Chase Utley with us for the bulk of the season." 
Utley was bothered by symptoms during the season but still hit .292 and led all second basemen with 33 home runs and 104 RBis. 
Philliesand Rangers complete
trade of first round p1cks 
ARLINGTON, Texas-The World Series champion Philadelphia Phillies and Texas Rangers swapped former first-round picks Thursday. 
Texas acquired outfielder Greg Golson from the Phillies for outfield­er John Mayberry. 
In another move, the Rangers des­ignated right-hander Kameron Loe for assignment in anticipation of sell­ing his rights to a team in Japan. 
Golson, who is from Texas, was the 21st overall pick by the Phillies in the 2004 draft. He spent last season at Double-A Reading, where he hit .282 with 13 homers and 60 RBis in 106 games. He went 0-for-6 as a September call-up for the Phillies, his only major league action. 
Mayberry, drafted 19th overall by the Rangers in 2005, hit .263 with 16 homers and 58 RBis in 114 games for Triple-A Oklahoma City this year. 
Kenseth siJ!ns mega-deal
with Roush renway Racing 
CONCORD, N.C. -Matt Kenseth signed a multiyear contract extension Thursday with Roush Fenway Racing to continue driving the No. 17 Ford. 
The deal comes at the end of one of Kenseth's most disappointing sea­sons: He failed to win a race for the first time since 2001, and his 11th­place finish in the standings was his lowest since that season. 
But the 2003 series champion has been with Roush since 1998, winning 16 Sprint Cup races and 24 Nationwide Series races. His champi­onship was the first for owner Jack Roush at the Cup level. 
"It's been a great 11 years at Roush Fenway Racing," Kenseth said. "We've had a lot of success together including a championship and I'm really proud of that. I'm looking for­ward to the next few years and win­ning another championship with Roush Fenway."

Quinn to play with broken finger 
Baseball institutes 
Associated Press 
BEREA, Ohio -Brady Quinn got his first NFL win as a starter almost single­handedly. 
Quinn broke his right index finger during the first half of Monday night's game against the Buffalo Bills, but Cleveland's new starting quarterback stayed in and led the Browns to a 29-27 victory. 
Despite the injury, Quinn will try to play Sunday when the Browns host the Houston Texans. 
"At this point, it's just a lit­tle sore," he said before practice on Thursday. "Just doing the best we can to take all the precautions to make sure it's all right." 
Quinn didn't seem to be 
bothered by the finger while throw­ing during the 30-minute segment of practice open to the media. He didn't favor the fin­ger while tak­ing snaps and fired a few tight spirals while working 
out in the team's indoor practice facility. Later, the team's injury report said Quinn participated in the full practice. 
The Browns initially thought Quinn only bruised his hand after banging it on the helmet of a Bills player. But after he complained of soreness following Wednesday's practice, X-rays were taken and revealed a fracture on the tip of his fin­ger. 
Quinn was cleared to play by a specialist at the Cleveland Clinic. 
"The hand specialist says 
because it's a fracture, sore­ness initially will be the thing that he has to deal with the most," coach Romeo Crennel said. "Then probably after this week, the soreness will die down. We plan to monitor

Fraley said Quinn showed no signs of being slowed by the injury during practice on Wednesday. 
"He looked fine," he said. "If you didn't say a word to me or anybody in this locker room, I don't think anybody else would have even known."

Mussina said he couldn't 
envision himself working in 
baseball in the foreseeable 
future, though he was open to 
someday helping out young 
pitchers. 
Money isn't an issue. He left Baltimore to sign an $88.5 million, six-year eontraet as a free agent with. the Yankees before the 2001 season and finished with a $23 million, two-year deal. 
Mussina graduated early from Stanford with an eco­nomics degree -he won the College World Series with the Cardinal -and carne to the Yankees with a reputation as an ace pitcher with a prickly personality. He softened over the years, and by the end became a chatty clubhot1se spokesman who kept reporters chuckling with his witty observations and thoughtful answers. 
Mussina frequently sat in front of his locker doing crossword puzzles. In fact, he appeared in the 2006 docu­mentary "Wordplay" and kept a thesaurus in his stall for knotty problems. 
No words, however, could change his mind on calling it a career. Mussina said he decided last January that he had one more season. 
"Good or bad, this is going to be the last year," he told himself. "That's just how I felt." 
Mussina said most of his teammates knew his plans. More relaxed, he called it a fun year. . 
Now, he said, it was time to stay home. Spring training would have to come and go. 
"I think February is going to be a little strange," he said. "It'll be different. It'll be weird."

this season 
with Hope, 

Calvin and Albion predicted to finish atop the conference. 
Tonight's match-up with Ohio Wesleyan starts the Anderson College Tip-Off Tournament in Anderson, Ind. 
"It's tough to be specific since it's the first game of the season for both teams," Henley said. "The only stats we have are from last season. Those do not give an accu­rate view of a team's poten­tial." 
The Belles will play in either the tournament's con­solation or championship game on Saturday before their home opener against Wheaton on Tuesday at 6 p.m.

Although the Irish and Buckeyes have not swam against each other in a dual meet in quite some time, they have participated in the Ohio State Invitational in each of the past two seasons. The Irish finished third in 2006 and fourth in 2007 while the Buckeyes placed second in both years. The University of Minnesota came in first in each meet.

NCAA FOOTBALL 
Pitt offense runs through McCoy 
Associated Press 
PITTSBURGH If Pittsburgh's Top 25 game at Cincinnati is tight in the fourth quarter Saturday night, both teams know what will happen when the Panthers have the ball. 
The same thing that hap­pened in last year's Panthers­Bearcats game. The Pitt-Notre Dame game earlier this month. The Pitt vs. then-No. 2 West Virginia game last season. 
LeSean McCoy, college foot­ball's road runner, is going to get the ball. A lot. 
McCoy is only a sophomore, but he might be the Panthers' best big-game rusher since Heisman Trophy winner Tony Dorsett in the 1970s. McCoy doesn't pile up his yards against the lightweights on the Panthers' schedule or in games in which they're lead­ing big. 
McCoy is often at his best when the games are the biggest, a quality not all 1,000­yard rushers possess. Especially in road games, where McCoy has gained more than haif of his career yardage. 
"We don't want to take the ball out of Shady's hands," offensive coordinator Matt Cavanaugh said. 
For good reason, too. 
During Pitt's 39-36, four­overtime win at Notre Dame on Nov. 1, McCoy rushed for 101 yards -from the fourth quarter on, finishing with 169 yards and a touchdown. That performance came during a four-week stretch in which he ran for 613 yards and 10 touchdowns against South Florida, Navy, Rutgers and Notre Dame. 
McCoy gained 137 yards as Pitt beat then-No. 23 Cincinnati 24-17 last season. Later in the season, he ran for 148 yards on 38 carries -on the road -as Pitt defeated West Virginia 13-9 in the biggest upset in school history. 
McCoy's ability to get tough yardage in difficult circum­stances has allowed Pitt to win its last five road games, beat­ing two Top 10 teams (West Virginia and then-No. 10 South Florida), plus Notre Dame. 
Now, No. 20 Pitt (7-2, 3-1 in Big East) will try to beat another ranked team on the road in No. 19 Cincinnati (8-2, 4-1), which is 0-7 against the Panthers. 
"Playing good on the road, that's worked out real well for us," said McCoy, who has 1,043 yards and 16 touch­downs this season after run­ning for 1,328 yards and 14 TDs as freshman. "This is in the point in the year where we really need it. We have a big game with Cincinnati on the road, so we have to keep our streak going." 
His streak, too. McCoy has rushed for 142 yards or more in each of his last five road games, and has gained 120 yards or more in seven of his nine career games away from Heinz Field. 
McCoy has been held below 100 yards only twice on the road and below 86 only once, a 60-yard game at Rutgers last season. He has gained 1,202 of his 2,371 career yards and has nine touchdowns in his nine road games, an average of 
133.6 yards.

According to Stats, Inc., the only running backs on Top 25 teams who have gained more road yardage than McCoy the last two seasons are MiQuale Lewis of Ball State (1,287 yards in nine games) and Chris Wells of Ohio State (1,282 yards in nine games). 
A big game from McCoy is almost a necessity if Pitt is to win at Cincinnati, which can all but wrap up the Big East title and a BCS bowl bid with a victory. The Bearcats' only remaining conference game after Saturday is against Syracuse (2-8, 1-5). 
"Cincinnati, I'm sure they're going to do their best to stop the run," quarterback Bill Stull said. "Louisville put a lot of extra time into doing that and was successful, but that allowed us to mix in a couple of other things with some reverses and trick plays." 
Louisville was so geared up to stop McCoy, limiting him to 39 yards and a touchdown on 17 carries on Nov. 8, that the rest of the offense pretty much did what it wanted. Stull passed for 216 yards and a touchdown and the Pitt defense scored two touch­downs during a 41-7 victory. 
Cincinnati's rushing defense is the third best in the Big East, allowing an average of 112 yards. 
"They probably have the toughest defense we'll face all season," Stull said. "They have a good secondary, but we believe they'll try to stop the run first. That's fine with us." 
A victory opens the door for the Panthers to win the confer­ence if they can beat West Virginia and Connecticut in their final two games. 
"Maybe we can be the team to do what we did to West Virginia last year, we can knock everybody else out," McCoy said. "That's our mind­set. We have three tough games left against three tough teams, so the way we look at it is, 'How bad do we want it?' " 
"The leaders on this team, they want it bad.... So does coach (Dave Wannstedt). Coach, he wants this real bad."

l11e Big Eru-.1 Champion<;hip starl'i up with a bang this morning in Pitl<>burgh with an opening round rematch again'it Omnectkul 
Attnr earning the number five sood la<>t weekend with a win over that same Connecticut team, the Irish are poi<>ed til build on some late season momentum <md make a run at the Big Ea'it Champion'>hip. 
"I think we have a really good chan<".t~ at winning the tournament," Iri'ih coach Debbin Brown said. "We have boon doing some things very well lately ;md I am very optimi'itic." 
The Irish have always played inspirnd volleyball in the Big Ea'>t Championship, especially in Pitl<>burgh. Ttu~ lri<>h havn won fwe of six league tournaments played in Piusburgh with <m impnJSsive 12-1 record. 
"In tl~rms of prPparation, we feel g<KKI. Wf~ know it will be a tremen­dously mmpetitiw tournament and we like that. because that type of environment brings out the best in us," Brown said. 
Ttw Irish are looking fbrward to tho t.oumament where all the teams are now even and anything can happPn. 
"The Big East tournament is

always fun and exciting," Brown said. "A'i much a<; we'd like to go into the tournament as a higher snnd, everyonn is 0-0 at this point. We're excited wfaee a first-round opponent that we just played. Whether we had won or lost the previous match, I'd say the same thing. You know who the players are and you have a better feel for the team, opposed wsomeone you played in the season's first week­end." 
The tournament will begin in unill>ual fashion, with the Irish play­ing the fourth-seeded Huskies for the second game in a row. The match la'>1 weekend ended in a 3-2 viewry for the Irish. The win against Conneetieut snapped the Huskies' SIWen game winning streak. 
"I was very plea'ied with how the def{m<;e played again<;t Connocticut," Brown said. "We held them to a very low hitting percentage." 
The fiuniliarity will be an advan­tage fbr the lri'ih, as they know what it takes to beat the I Itt<;kies. 
"It helps that we just played them," Brown said. "It would be dif­feront if we played them earlier in the year, but we know exactly what toexpeel" 
The Htt<>kies eome inw the tour­nament on fire. The loss to Notre Dame was only the second loss Connecticut has suffered since and 11 assists in 19 games under the US Under-18 team thi<> season and tallied two goals and 12 assists in 59 games for the Under­17 squad last season. 
"Cam is a dynamic player at the defense position," Jackson said. "He'll be a great power-play quar­terbaek and potentially is as tal­ented a defenseman as we've ever had at Notre Dame." 
Palmieri, the final member of the Team USA trio, is a 5-foot-10, 180-pound right wing who moved up wthe Under-18 squad midway through last season after starting the eampaign with the Under-17 team. He wtaled 29 goals and 19 assist<; in 66 games between the two teams last year, and has five goal<; and four assist<; through 19 games thi'> season. 
"Kyle is a dynamic player who plays with a lot of jam. He's a ommsively skilled with excellent hockey instincts and is a fierce eompetitllr," Jackson said. "Kyle i'i one of those players that makes thinf.,'S happen on the ice." 
At 6-foot-2 and 203 pounds, Larson is a prototypical, physical Jell wing who is a facwr in front of the net. Last season, he played alongside current Irish freshman forward Billy Maday with the Waterloo Black Hawks, when he totaled 19 goal<; and 19 assi<;l<; in the regular season and added three goals and two assists in the playoii'i. 

"Nick plays well without the pouck and knows how wput him­self in position to score," Jackson said. "He's got a good shot with a quick release and is at his best when he plays with a physical edge." 
A second cousin of former Irish defenseman Brock Sheahan, who graduated last year, Ryan Sheahan is a 6-foot-2, 195-pound center who is a quiek, skilled offensive threat. His team, the St. Catharines Falcons, lead their divi­sion, and he leads the squad with 1 7 goals and 31 assists in 24 games-that's two points a game. 
"Riley will be a dynamie player at the collegiate level," Jaekson said. "He's got all the wols. He's as complete a player as we've recruited from an offensive per­spective, and yet he's not afraid w get hi'> nose dirty." 
While the Irish are surely look­ing forward to the arrival of their five future teammates, thls year's installment of Notre Dame hockey will begin a home-and-home weekend series with Bowling Green wnight. 
The No. 5 Irish (7-3-1, 3-2-1-1 CCHA) host the Falcons (5-5-2, 4­3-1-0 CCHA) at 7:35 p.m. tonight before the same two teams meet tllmorrow night in Bowling Green, Ohio.

they would like wsee again in the

me next year.· And at first thought she meant we had too many guards and I didn't think she was going to lit, and I had a moment of 'I bntter explain this right away.' 
"And tlwn I just realized she was saying 'Yes.' Thero was some pandemonium in the locker room. 
Unlike with most players, who start getting heavily recruited later in thPir high school earners, Diggins' process bngan much oar­tier. McGraw said she lirst ollcrnd thn 5-loot-9 !,'liard a scholarship in eighth grade. 
"We had seen her play and I knPw she was going to bn a great player," McCraw said. " ... She was really special illld I think we could tell that right away." 
Pnwiously. thP earliest McGraw said shn omm~d a scholarship was during the sophomore seasons of current juniors Ashley Barlow and Mnli<>sa Lnchlitnnr. 
"They both committed at the olli~r. so that's why we thought it was supposed to work," McGraw said jokingly. 
One of the things that made 
. signing Diggins more dillieult than any other prospect during McCraw's long tenure at Notre Damn is that she is by far the highest ranked prospect to com­mit to the University in program history. McGraw said the national attention Diggins received made rneruiting her a lot morn stressful than her expnrience with other players. "It is a long promss, and I think it got a little morn strnssful as the process went on," MeGraw said. "Wn were just trying to not put 
pressurn on her, illld trying to let her come to the decision herself without trying to talk her into it." 
The fact that Diggins is a South Bend native helped ease the process, McGraw said, since she illld her staff could put in a lot of face time at Diggins' high school games. McGraw said she almost had to "1-.ruard her turf' because of the numbnr of coaches flying into South Bnnd to watch Diggins play. 
"We keep talking to people at the airport to delay the nights coming in, put that fence up around town, charge a toll to get in. We could have made a lot of money this year," McGraw said. 
Hegardless of the extra atten­tion on Diggins, McGraw said the proeess remained the same as it has with all of her other players. 
"Most of [the girl<> on the team] committed so early in the process, nom~ of them except for [sopho­more forwardl Devereaux [PetersI. took any other official vL<>­it.<>," she said. 
Diggins is currently 19th on the all-time scorers' list in Indiana high school girls basketball with 2,036 points. She has averaged 24.8 points, 5.6 rebounds, 5.4 assist.'>, 4.1 steals and 1.3 blocks per game during her three years on the varsity team at Washington. She has also started 81 of 82 games at the school­which has a 76-6 record in the last three seasons -illld won the state championship her sopho­more season. 
Diggins joins point guard Kaila Turner from Joliet, Ill., and Marian Catholic I Iigh School as this year's recruiting class ­ranked between No. 13 and No. 18 by national recruiting services. This marks the twdfth consecu­tive top 25 recruiting elass for thP Irish, a feat matched only by perennial powerhouses Tennessee illld Connecticut. 

McGraw said her recruiting is likely done, unless a big name post player comes up later in the process. If current senior guard Lindsay Schrader opts to take her redshirt fifth-year (earned after tearing her ACL two seasons ago), the Irish will have 13 players on the roster next season. 
But looking into the more immediate future, the Irish will take on Boston College Sunday at Chestnut Hills, Mass. 
The Eagles currently sit at 3-0, thilllks in large part to their front court. Center Carolyn Swords stands at 6-foot-6 and forward Stefanic Murphy have helped lead the scoring so far this year for Boston College. Sword<> is first on the team, averaging a double­double through three games at 
21.7 points and 10 boards, while Murphy is third with 11 points per game. 
"We're going to count on Erica Williamson and hope our post defense can really come through tor us," McGraw said. 
McGraw said the team will be working on boxing out and rebounding this week at practice to make up for the size differen­tial. In Notre Dame's la<>t game, a 96-61 win over Evansville Wednesday night, the-Irish were outrebounded 42-36. 
McGraw said she doesn't expect her team to play as much man-to­man defense to avoid mismatches, but added that this game will come to which scheme will work best. 
"We'll see is it a speed issue or a size issue, what's going to win," she said.

go after it," he said. "They're very similar to Marquette or (North] Carolina in that way ... At the end of the day, I think we're gonna go out there and lind a very good team." 
But that's not to say that Minnesota has a weak back line. 
'They're a very good defense, much like we are," he said. "They haven't given up a ton of this season. Bock, whose injured leg has no structural damage, has been unable to practice due to the intense pain it causes her. 
'To tell you the truth, I think we've gotten beyond the fact that we might have to play with­out her," Waldrum said. " ... But [the team] hasn't skipped a beat with lout herl. We've played the last few games of the season without her and, in the begin­ning of the season, we played some big games without her." 
Freshman Melissa Henderson, 
who has scored 
17 goals, gives

r o u n d Tournament games, welcome a Golden Gophers team that is used to the cold weather. 
"Usually we look at the cold (weather] as a homefield advan­tage for us," Waldrum said. "But that's not the case this time around." 
For that reason, Waldrum said the Irish hope to see tremendous fan support tonight. 
"That's where the crowd can really help us out," he said. "We really need their help so I hope to see a Iotta students come out." 
The Irish will play without co­captain Brittany Bock for the fourth straight game and Waldrum said the team is not optimistic that she can return national title. 
"I think when you look at the 16 that are left, there are no real surprises out there," he said. "At the end of the day, any of them can win it all and it wouldn't be a terrible surprise. It's the lirst year in a long time where there haven't been any big surprises." 
So Notre Dame heads into tonight's matchup with the Golden Gophers with the inten­tion of focusing on one game at a time. And Waldrum said the team cannot wait to take the field. 
"I think everyone's ready to go, and excited," he said. "Even with the eold weather, we're ready."

HOROSCOPE 

CELEBRITIES BORN ON THIS DAY: Kate Moss, 34; Sade, 49; John Carpen­ter, 60; Dr. Laura Schlessinger, 61 
Happy Birthday: Think matters through before you take action. You may not have all the infonnation you need to make a good decision. Be willing to research every aspect of what you want to see happen before you make your move. This is the year to be fully prepared so that you can make the most of the opportunities around you. Your numbers are 7, 13, 20, 25, 32, 46 
ARIES (Mardi 21-Apri119): Don't let someone else's emotional trauma bring you down. You have plenty going your way and, ifyou stop to meddle in other people's problems, you will miss something special. You'll have a passionate ap­proach to whatever you do. 3 stars TAURUS (April 20-May 20): Don't expect to get help from others when you should be doing the work yourself. Someone from your past may propose some­thing that interests you. A new project can turn into a long-tenn, profitable ven­ture. 3 stars GEMINI (May 21-June 20): Not everything will be out in the open or made readily available for you to see. Scrutinize what others are doing. A cheerful ap­proach will help you to decipher what everyone around you is up to. 3 stars CANCER (June 21-Jnly 22): You may not like change but you are overdue. A little effort will result in comfortable surroundings. A good talk with someone you love will lead to a better understanding of one another. 4 stars LEO (July 23-Ang. 22): You may feel more like having some fun but you should be focusing on what you can do to get ahead professionally, educationally or fi­nancially. The time you spend organizing, planning and manipulating your future will pay off. 2 stars VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Deal with emotional issues quickly and you will spare yourself ongoing problems. Be precise about how you feel and what you expect and you will gain the respect of the people you are dealing with. A new challenge will inspire you. 5 stars LIBRA (Sept. 23-0ct. 22): Put more effort into fiXing up your place or looking for a new investment that will help you save. Getting out with friends or family and trying something new will inspire you to do more of the things that you find motivating. A love interest will develop. 3 stars SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Your emotions will be tested today. Not everyone will be forthright regarding intentions and expectations. Instead of letting things get to you, make decisions that will set you apart and help you counteract any fonn of manipulation. 3 stars SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dee. 21): Get serious about your future. Travel, educa­tion and picking up information that can transfonn your life should be consid­ered. An older or more experienced individual will be able to shed some light on an interesting topic. 3 stars CAPRICORN (Dee. 22-Jan. 19): Spend time on yourself. Ifyou look good, you will feel good. A property deal or investment can be put into play with the expec­tation of making a clear profit. A move from one location to another will revital­ize you. 5 stars AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Help others and you will help yourself. Taking action will prove that you are capable ofbeing a leader and give you the respect of people who cau influence your future. Your chann, electric personality and vision will be all that's required. 2 stars PISCES (Feb. 19-MarclJ 20): Don't put too much trust into what others say they will do. Unless you have something in writing, it isn't likely to manifest into any­thing. Offer your time and expertise but don't give cash to a cause you Irnow little about. 4 stars 
Birthday Baby: You are aggressive, forthright and in command. You are capable of getting others to do things for you and can always come up with solutions when needed. You are a leader.

treatment from coach Charlie Weis, as he has personally flown to Hawaii twice in the past year to recruit Te'o. 
Mike Frank, who covers Notre Dame football for Scout.com thinks very highly of Te'o, and would be an excel­lent addition to an already solid class of 2009. 
"Manti is a game-changing type of linebacker," Frank said. 
"He's a guy that can make big, big plays. He's a guy with incredible speed and the ability to run sideline to sideline. He's got the kind of speed and ath­leticism that they've been look­ing for at linebacker." 
If Te'o were to give his verbal commitment to Notre Dame, Frank believes that the line­backer would have an immedi­ate impact, even as a fresh­man. 
"He's the type of guy that if he comes in as a true fresh­man, he has the ability to get on the field quickly, maybe even start," Frank said. "lie really has that kind of skill." 
One of the more interesting aspects of Te'o's recruitment is that the high-school senior wishes to go on a Mormon mis­sionary trip in between his

Irish coach Jeff Jackson locked up fivn recruits Thursday that will arrive at Notre Dame next fall, con­tinuing the tradition of strong recruiting that Jackson has devel­oped since arriving in 2005. 
Defensemen Sam Calabrese and Cam Fowler join forwards Kyle Palmieri, Nick Larson and Riley Sheahan to form one of the most highly touted five-man recruiting classes in the nation. 
"We're very excited about this group of players and have been waiting a long time for their arrival," Jackson said in making the announcement. "This class L<> as good a class a<; we've ever had at Notre Dame. They will definitely be one of the elite recruiting class-

Weather, competition heat up for Notre Dame 
By GREG ARBOGAST 
Sports Writer 
Let the test begin. 

Faced with arguably the most difficult schedule in the country, No. 9 Notre Dame will begin its difficult non-conference slate with a West Coast swing that begins tonight against Loyola Marymount. 
The Lions aren't the difficult part. Loyola Marymount has lost all three of its games this season, falling to Milwaukee, Iowa State and UC Davis. 
The Lions likely will bring emotion to Friday night's con­test with the Irish, though, as the game will serve as the team's home opener as well as a commemoration for Hall of Famer and LMU alum Pete Newell, who died on Monday. 
Things get tougher for the 
Irish, as following the weekend they head to llawaii for the Maui Invitational. The Irish have a potential stretch of three games in three days after bat­tling Loyola Marymount only two days prior to the start of the tournament. 
The Irish will face in-state rival Indiana in the first round in a nationally televised game on ESPN2 at 5:30 p.m. Eastern time. After the Hoosiers were faced with scandal under for­mer coach Kelvin Sampson, they brought in a familiar face for many Irish fans, former Marquette coach Tom Crean, to lead the program. 
Crean appears to still be set­tling into his new role. The Hoosiers have looked far from convincing in their first two games where they led

for his one famous rule: "There is no crying in base­ball." 
The rule has been broken plenty of times, and if it is applied across all sports the number of infractions jumps exponentially. So, is it really wrong to shed a few tears in either pain or joy after an emo­tionally draining game, season or career? 
Cowboys' star Terrell Owens certainly d01~sn 't think so -he proved that during his blubber­ing defense of his "teammate" Tony Homo after a playofl' loss last year.

the past four years have cer­tainly been packed with excite­ment and emotions. 
Despite having gone through the highs and lows, this year's seniors still have no idea how they will handle their last trip to Hoek's house. 
Fullback Asaph Schwapp said he didn't know what would be going through his mind when the ride finally ends. He did say that he knew some guys would break down, but he didn't throw any of them under the bus. 
"I don't want to name any names, that would be pretty embarrassing for those guys," he said. 
But really, there is nothing to be ashamed of. 
For four years the senior elass has put in endless hours in the weight room, in practice and in meetings to perform on Saturdays. Many have over­come injuries and adversity throughout their tenure, and for most this is the end of the line for a game that has eon­sumnd their lives. 
Leaving behind football will be like losing a family member -definitely grounds for weep­ing.

in Kleenex knows that sports are played with raw emotion. Sometimes those emotions spill over into the aftermath. and despite what Jimmy Dugan may have to say on the matter, it's part of the game. 
So, don't be surprised to see some waterworks following Saturday's game against Syracuse as a group of 23 sen­iors leave the beloved tunnel for the very last time. Irish coach Charlie Weis sure won't bn. 
"This is a tough game for a lot of players, personally," Weis said. "You see them in the lock­er room before and after the game, you'll see kids after the game that you didn't even know how much they eared and they're bawling, just cry­ing because how mnotional it is." 
This year's senior class, both those who have played and those who have watched, have had their up and downs inside Notre Dame Stadium. 
The first time they saw "the greatest sight these eyes have ever seen" was a heartbreak­ing overtime loss to Michigan State. Two weeks later the Stadium hosted one of the most exciting football games in col­lege football history against Southern Cal -we won't get into winners and losers in that game. 
These seniors have witnessed baek-to-baek BCS bowl bids, and they have also witnessed the worst record in the pro­gram's history. If nothing else, 
long night of 

complaining about bowl losses, they were hard at work trying to fix the problem. 
Who is going to tell Nik Hodriguez or John Leonis they don't deserve a good ery? They have already given the Irish their blood and sweat, why not their tears? 
Ironically enough, 65 fiction­al years ago when Dugan first handed out his decree to Evelyn Gardner they were standing -where else? -in our very own South Bend, Ind. 
Dugan's Hockford Peaches were taking on the South Bend Bltw Sox when he put a ban on bawling in 1943. The same year that Frank Leahy won his first National Championship and Angello Bertelli won Notre Dame's first ever Heisman Trophy. 
The Stadium has seen seven more championships and six more Heisman winners since then, but none of them were legally allowed to celebrate with tears. 
This year, it is finally time that we lift the ban. 
So, seniors, this Saturday when all is said and done leave everything you have on the field, the sidelines or even in the stands. And remember, it's your party so cry if you want to.

So far this season, Notrn

Turkovich played all of' last SIHtson, starling every garrw al lnl'l guard, bPI'ore making tlw transition in the spring. lin said the transition was a rnsult of' the rotation the ol'l'nnsivn linemen did during training camp to f'ind thn bnst f'it. 
"In thn spring, we wern rotating guys around and [offensive line[ coaeh [John Latina! said, 'Could you go in at left tackle today?' And I was working with [the back­ups) because I was getting baek in the rotation [after) an injury," Turkovich said. 
Turkovich said he felt com­fortable with the switch to the outside of the line right away. 
"I thought, 'Hey, this is your chanen. .Just play with reck­loss abandon.' You can't be thinking out there. Just do your job and do it fundamen­tally sound," he said. 

Latina said that the transi­tion from guard to tackle is a morn diff'ieult ono than from tacklo to guard bneause you arn morn isolated and f'aeing a dil'f'ernnl kind of' rusher. Playing in what the eoaeh called "a phone book amount of' spacn," a guard is glmnral­ly rnatdwd up against a large defensive tackle. But an oiTensivn tackle has to bloek spendinr defensive ends and linnbaeknrs one-on-one. 
One main reason Turkovich has bnm1 able to transition .so nas i I y i s b e cct u s ~~ he h as played the position before. llis first two years at Notrn Damn were spent as a taekle befon~ he moved inside last season. Turkovich said he made thn switch to guard because Latina said it would be his best fit. 
Turkovich also played tack­le in high school, but started his football career as a tight end. 
"In high school I was a tight end that ate himself into the tackle position," he said. "I weighed 215, 210 my junior year of high school, bulked up my senior year." 
Turkovich also credited his teammates with easing his transition back to tackle, especially left guard Eric 
Olsen. 
"When you play next to a guy like Erie IOlsenl, he's a good player and he makes it easinr on you. You know he's going to do his job," Turkovi1:h said. "You ean trust him. Same thing with tight ends, you can trust them. It's made the transition easier." 
This season, Turkovich has been a solid pHrformer on the line, as nvident by the fact that Clauson has yet to be hit from his blind side. And dur­ing last wnek's 23-7 loss to Mil:higan State when the line surrendered its only three sacks of' the season, the Spartans blitzed when tho Irish were in nmpty backfield formations, putting the ol'fen­sivo linn at a disadvantage. 
Turkovieh said thn offensive line is better than it was last season, but still has room for improvement -especially af'tcr netting only 16 yards rushing against the Spartans. 
"We can get better as far as the run game and get better with our fundamentals," he said. " ... Last game they were getting pressure and getting sacks and we can't win if that happens." 
But even with the line's marked improvement this season, something Turkovich has been a major part of, he remains his own harshest critic. 
"Even if I make a block on a play, I'll still [thinking] I could have done better," the senior said. "I think that I've done good things, but there's definitely room for improve­ment still." 

Turkovich said the most important thing for him this year is to make sure he leaves Notre Dame on a high note. After last season's deba­cle for the linemen, he wants

THOMAS BEMENDERFER 

Offensive line111an to enter 111edical school after graduation 
By JAY FITZPATRICK Managing Editor 
While some of' his classmates will be looking into the job market and others will be proparing f'or tho N Fl. dral't in April. linoman Thomas Bnmnnderf'er will bn gdting rnady f'or rnndieal school. 
The Mishawaka nativn only applind at one school -pre­ferring to stay in-state at Indiana -and said he feels conlidm1t about being accepted tlwrn. lie has already taken his interview for IU, but has not heard back yet. 
Bnmnndnrf'Pr is a Scinnce Pre-Professional major enrolled in tho College of' Sdonce, and has also made the Dean's List. lin said that com­bining a rigorous acadnmie sdwdule with f'ootball has b!HHl one of tho more reward­ing parts of' his college experi­ence. 
"It's probably one of the most valuable things I've learned by taking hard eourses and doing football at the same time is time management,'' Bemenderfer said. "You always have to realizll what you have to get done, when you need to do it. To be suceessful, you have to put a lot of time in." 
Bemenderfer added that the benefits that come from his busy schedule should pay off in the long run. 
"One of the things you sacri­lice is free time, but it's worth it. It's worth it to do well in school, it's really worth it to do well in football," he said. 

Despite seeing limited play­ing time during his time with the Irish, Bemenderfer has taken his work ethic from the classroom and applied it to the praetice field. 
"You can never take a play ofT, you can never choose to be lazy, because if you're doing that you're not getting better," he said. 
Offensive line coach John Latina said this hardworking personality is one of the things that has made Bemenderfer such an asset to the line dur­ing his time at Notre Dame. One major result of his hard work is that Bemenderf'er can play at all three interior line positions. 
"lie's a guy who's been around a long time. Understands concepts, under­stands our bloeking schemes and our plays. It's a great 
advantage when  we can do  
that," Latina said.  
Latina  added  that  

Bemenderfer has been a great role model for other players in terms of his work ethic and study habits. 
"I think a lot of the younger players look up to him because they respect his hard work ethic, he's a tough kid, he's smart," Latina said. "They see that he's played multiple posi­tions, and the only way you do that is become a student of the game. And they also know his off-the-field habits in the classroom. I think he's a great guy to emulate if you're a young player." 
Even though Bemnnderfer grew up in South Bend and had two older brothers attend Notre Dame, his first choice was Northwestern, where he received a full athletic scholar­ship. However, after tho death of' former Wildcats coaeh Handy Walker, Bemenderfer decided to transfer to Notre Dame. 
Bemenderl'nr said tho deci­sion was a tough one to make since he was walking away from a guaranteed free ride without any guarantee of mak­ing the football team. 
"I took a leap or faith without any promises and without talk­ing to the coaching staff and everything turned out really well and I got really lucky," he said. 
But when it eame down to it, Bemenderfer decided he had to follow his dreams. 
"When it comes down to it, you only live life once, you might as well do it the way you want to and live your dreams," he said of his decision to trans­fer. 
Going to Notre Dame was always a dream for Bemenderfer, one that started when his father would take him to games as a child. 
"It was just an incredible 
experience, walking around, seeing all the people, the emo­tion, walking around campus and seeing the tradition. Everything about Notre Dame is magical," Bemenderfer said. 
All of Bemenderfer's hard work and gutsy decisions have paid off so far, as he has earned a scholarship each of the last two seasons. 
"It puts you on top of the 

world when you get that schol­arship and you know that all your hard work had some kind of result. 
But not even that could go to Bemenderfer's head. 
"[The scholarship) just moti­vated me to work harder," he said.

Editor's note: this story origi­nally ran on Nov. 7, 2008. 
It takes a pretty good excuse for Irish coach Charlie Weis to allow a player to miss practice. This summer fifth-year senior Maurice Crum Jr. came up with one that was good enough to miss a whole week of work­outs. 
Crum spent a week in Accra, Ghana bringing much-needed eomputers and books to a local orphanage. 
Crum along with several oth­ers from Students Bridging the Information Gap (SBIG) arrived in 

While in Africa, Crum helped set up the new library and taught some of the 300 chil­dren living at the orphanage how to use the computers. They also had some time for fun. 
"I got to play a soccer game with the kids. They were younger kids, but they killed us," he said. "Next time I go back, I think I'll bring a foot­ball." 
The program intends to visit and donate to a different orphanage in Africa each year. Crum said he plans to attend and do as much as he can to help out.

Crum already holds an impressive spot in the books with the longest games played and games started streaks in the program's rich history. Crum was red-shirted his freshman season, since then he has played in every single game for the past four years. 
"I feel like my greatest attribute is my toughness," Crum said. "If I can help the team and be effective, I'm going to play." 
Crum has also started 44 of those 45 including 43 in a row to start his career. Crum's one miss was two weeks ago against the Huskies in Washington. Crum sat out the first play because of the forma­tion Washington opened the game with. 
And he has never missed a game due to injury. 
"It has a lot to do with will power. You're going to get beat up, but for me the greatest cure for pain is for the next play to occur," he said. "As long as you are out on that field and the adrenaline is pumping, nothing else really matters." 
Crum needed all the adrena­line he could muster during his sophomore season when he played the majority of the sea­son with a back injury. Crum said that he frequently had back spasms throughout the season, but didn't want to get the necessary surgery until the season had ended.

Senior defensive lineman Pat Kuntz attempts to break up a pass in Notre Dame's 23-7 loss to Michigan State on Sept. 20. 
"It's a lot more attacking defense," he said. "I played a lot of 3-technique my first two years. It's definitely different, but it reminds me a little bit of it." 
Stanford's running backs, Toby Gerhart and Anthony Kimble, present a two-sided challenge to Notre Dame's defense Saturday. To quelch the running game, Brown said, the defense has to control the line of scrimmage. 
"All running backs run the same when there's no hole," Brown said. "When there's no hole or the holes are small, it's harder for them to be effec­tive." 
For that to happen, he said, Kuntz has to cause problems up front. 
"We need him to play hard, be disruptive in there," Brown said. "He's the oldest guy out there for the most part. He's gotta show them. When he's out there he needs to be a problem." 
Disruptiveness isn't a physi­cal trait, Oliver said. It's a men­tality. 
"The way we call our defens­es help that because we call an aggressive style of defense," Oliver said. "It's their attitude, just wanting to get there." 
That aggressive play-calling hasn't produced much in the way of tangible results this sea­son -only one sack -but that didn't concern Kuntz or Brown. Kuntz said there were other stats, like completion percent­age or turnovers forced, that showed the success of a defen­sive scheme. Brown's philoso­phy, he said, is to keep the offense short of the sticks at all cost. The other team could complete 70 percent of their passes, he said, but as long as

I schools. like Richmond impress college scouts and and Towson, eventually Boston College started showing more interest in him. After the Eagles, teams like Notre Dame, Penn State, Michigan and Florida all started looking at Brown. 
Brown said that the biggest reason for this increased atten­tion was the work of Joseph and his father, Michael Brown. 
"After a couple of games, I played really, really well and my dad was just, 'We need to send some of these tapes out.' So between my dad and my coach. they made some tapes. My dad just sending tapes everywhere, probably like 50 schools, or something like that," Brown said. 
Brown said he didn't know how he was so lucky that he could wind up playing football at Notre Dame after only one year, but said that he was meant to be here. 
"That was God's work, I say. It's interesting. I play for Notre Dame and through God in there, and it's such a religious institution. There's a reason for everything happening. I'm sup­posed to be here, I guess," he said. 
Brown said that when Notre Dame first started recruiting him, he had no idea about the school's history or tradition, but knew it must have been a spe­cial place because of how oth­ers treated it. 
"The thing that struck me was this place had to be special because of the reaction I would get from everyone. It was the reaction that people gave me that kind of gave me the sense that this was some place spe­cial. And when I came up here, it sort of proved itself true," he said. 
But after giving the Irish another look, he said the school was a perfect "three-for-three" fit for him. 
"One of the things that stood out to me was that people talk about -you get a degree from Notre Dame, you're set for life. The fact that the school was a very religious institution, very

COACHING 

Offensive coordinator Mike Haywood will miss practice again this week, putting Charlie Weis in charge of play­calling once again. On the other side of the ball, Corwin Brown has his defense playing as 
consistently  as  they  
have  in  a  very  long  
time.  

Syracuse announced following last week's loss to the Huskies that head coach Greg Robinson will be gone after this season. After four years as the leader of the Orange he has racked up a grand total of nine wins. 

IRISH PASSING 

For the first time in four years the Notre Dame pa<>sing offense has taken a baek seat to the ~-,rround game. Clausen threw only 18 times last week, but did so efficiently after a few early miscues. The passing game will be hurt with the loss of star receiver Michael Floyd. 
Syracuse doesn't crack the top 100 in FBS pass defenses, but they are experienced at corner­back and have come up with seven interceptions so far this season. 
After an up-and­down season so far this year, Weis has fmally taken back the offensive reins and is ready to show how fancy a Jimmy Clausen-led offense can be. The seniors step up and make their last game at the Stadium one of their best. Throw in a reel­

QUARTERBACKS 
Jimmy Clausen has turned the ball over six times in his last two games. But last week against Navy he seemed to be getting back on track completing 15 of his 18 pass attempts. Senior Evan Sharpley might also see the field in his final home game. 
Former walk-on Cameron Dantley and Andrew Robinson are expected to split time under center this Saturday. The duo has thrown for less than a touchdown per game and completed less than 50 percent of their pass­es. 
With Charlie Weis manning the helm once again thi<> week, the Irish offense will continue to thrive. Jimmy Clausen plays better than he's shown the past two games; he's just been in a funk. The running game continues to suc­ceed, especially if Weis

INTANGIBLES 

It's senior day in South Bend. The Irish defense is led by three seniors who will undoubtedly be fired up for a memorable farewell. The rest of the team will also be intent on sending out their elders on a high note.  
The Orange learned early this week that this was the end of the line for head coach Greg Robinson. Those announcements can often give a team a spark and of course a big underdog is always dangerous.  

Syracuse has absolutely nothing to lose this weekend, which makes them scary. Expect to see plenty of trick plays and weird risks from the Orange. But even the Annexation of Puerto Rico (see little Giants) wouldn't be enough for 'Cuse this weekend The

ORANGE PASSING 
When I was a sophomore, my friends and I agreed that, since I'm kind of a big guy, I would only go up for push­ups if Notre Dame hit 40 points. That hasn't happened in a few years. I think this week I'll finally get another chance in my last home

Muscle Man 
Asaph Schwapp has had to work hard his whole life to get where he is, and he wouldn't have it any other way 
By DAN MURPHY SportS Editor 
At six feet tall, 260 pounds. Asaph Schwapp is an imposing figure, and that's after losing weight during the offseason. 
Despite dropping nearly 20 pounds last winter. Notre Dame's fullback remains a bruising force on the field -a forcr. that is pr.rhaps topped only by his handiwork in the weight room. Schwapp is widely regarded at the team's strongest player. This summer, he bench pressed 530 pounds, that is more than double his body weight. 
"Yeah. I still hold that title," Schwapp said. "I love bench pn~ssing and that type of stuff." 
Schwapp said he's been a gym rat since his days in high school and still likes to get in a few oxtra sets in the off-season after he is done with the team's regu­larly-sehed­uled lifts. 
"I do the program with the team and lation of "United in Brotherhood" spans a banner above his initials. 
On the right arm, is a portrait of his mother, Evelyn, who died of cancer when s(:hwapp was only nine years old. 
"It was tough but I learned to deal with it," he said. "I believe it made me a stronger person." 
Schwapp said that the picture on his arm serves as a constant reminder of her and drives him to succeed in everything that he does. 
"I always think she's looking over me and wants me to do the best, so I always try to do the best," he said. 
After his mother's death, Schwapp was raised by his aunt and uncle who encouraged him to play football. 
"I always liked football, but my uncle used to always want me to play because he figured I 
would make  a  good football  
player," he said.

said. 
Schwapp has gotten so big that he has to redo some of the tattoos on his biceps. His right arm now fea­tures a trio of Aces -in honor of his nickname -originally, he only had the canvas for one. 
"The centerpiece was my first tattoo, but my arm got a little too big so I had to add some to fill it out a little bit," Schwapp said. 
The Aces are hardly the most important ink that Schwapp has on his big frame. A pair of tat­toos on his inner forearms reminds him daily of his family. On the left arm, the Latin trans-
on the field 
during his 
career at 
Notre Dame. 

As a fresh­man, he was thrown right into the mix appearing in all 12 Irish games that year. He racked up 67 yards on 27 carries includ­ing eight in his biggest game of the year against BYU. The Irish won that game 49-23. 
Schwapp looked like he would continue to be a major part of the Irish offense at the start of his sophomore season. However, his season ended less than two games in against Penn State. 
Late in third quarter of a 41­17 win over the Nittany Lions, Notre Dame ran a toss play and Schwapp was hit awkwardly, aggravating an old knee injury. This time, it required surgery that would leave him on the sidelines for the remainder of the season. 
"It definitely set me back a lit­tle bit, but I worked it out and rehabbed pretty hard and I was able to get back into the swing on things," Schwapp said. 
After surgery in October, it was back to the familiar con­fines of the weight room. He put in two or three sessions every day in order to rebuild some of the strength he had lost in his legs. Schwapp did countless hamstring and quadriceps workouts to regain the muscle mass he lost as a result of the surgery. 
"It wasn't fun," he said. "It

was tough, I had never had any­thing like that in my life, never had surgery in my life. It took some getting used to." 
Schwapp's hard work put him back on the field at full strength for the season opener in 2007 against Georgia Tech. 
"It was great not having to wear that knee brace anymore and being able to run with no worries," Schwapp said. 
With the brace gone, Schwapp was able to get back to doing what he loves the most -mak­ing holes. 
In 36 career games, No. 44 has racked up exactly 44 car­ries for 99 yards, but that's just fine with him. Schwapp said he gets the most joy out of leading the way for his fellow running backs. 
"''m always fired up to play, every time I hit the field I'm just trying to bash somebody," he said. 
That's the way it's been for the senior since his days playing midget football in Hartford, Conn. 
Schwapp's hard-nosed style of play is slowly disappearing from the game, especially at the next level. Spread offenses and limit­ed player rosters have caused most NFL teams to cut down to one or no true fullbacks on their rosters. Schwapp isn't dis­couraged. 
''I'm still trying to turn this into a career," he said. "I think I'm good at what I do and if I can get to a team that will use a fullback, I think they'll like me." 
Schwapp is scheduled to graduate this May, but because of his injury he is eligible for one more year with the team. He has decided not to make the decision about whether or not he will apply for a fifth year until after this season comes to a close. 
Whether he decides to enter the draft or not, Schwapp still has at least one more game at Notre Dame Stadium and right now that's all that's on his mind.

JEFF TISAK 

Walk-on tackle living the life he never thought he could 
By JARED JEDICK 
Sports Wrirer 
ommsive tackle Jell" Tisak took the long and hard road of a walk-on to the Notre Dame filOt­ball team, but he doesn't regret a second of it. Being a part of the Notre Dame football tradition has been an experience beyond what he ever imagined. 
"Notre Dame is something that you do not even think is real," Tisak said. "It is something that you see on television and could never ima~-,riml being a part of. It goes way beyond just being a fan. It is like being a part of a fable or a legend." 
Tisak said he is honored that he was given the chance to just keep playing. 
"I love being part of the tradi­tion, being around a ~-,rreat group of guys and a great bunch of coaches. and play for the University," Tisak said. 
Growing up in the small steel town of Ambridge in western Pa., with his two younger siblings Becky and Jon. Tisak never knew that he could be a part of some­thing as spedal as playing foot­ball at Notre Dame. But Tisak drnw inspiration from his father who was both a lieutenant colonel in the marines and is now an FBI agent in Duluth, Minn. 
"We came from a blue-collar town." Tisak said. "With my fathnr being an FBI agent and a member of the military, he has really been an inspiration to me." 
The beginning of Tisak's love for Notre Dame really came seven years before his accept­ance into the University when his family would make trips between the Pittsburgh area and Duluth. They would make stops along the way that would inevitably include the Notre Dame campus. 
"By the time l got into Notre Dame. it was already like a sec­ond home to me," Tisak said. "I had been here all the time, l knew the ins and outs of the campus and knew a lot of people already on campus." 
But getting on campus and joining the football team was not as easy as just being familiar with them -it would take a lot of hard work. Tisak had to first get into Notre Dame academical­ly and then go through the ardu­ous process of walking on under Irish coach Charlie Weis. 
"ln high school. I had to work really hard to get all the grades to even get in," Tisak said. "Then l had to work very hard every day on the practice field and in the weight room." 
That hard work has to extend even further, as Tisak is a double major in the fields of political sci­ence and sociology. Balancing that heavy workload with playing on the football field has not been easy. 

"You don't sleep very much. You come out of practice late, get something to eat, and start studying," Tisak said. "You have to make do with what you've got. You have to just make do." 
Tisak finds relief from the work and inspiration from his two sib­lings, Becky and Jon. . 

Becky is a trainer on campus and Tisak gets a chance to see her from time to time around the facilities. 
"It is great to just see her around every once in a while," Tisak said. 
Tisak is also proud of his younger brother Jon, who is cur­rently at the end of his high school career and is looking at possibly coming to Notre Dame as well. 
"My brother Jon plays football and baseball and he has excel­lent grades," Tisak said. "He is hoping to get in, but it is up to the coaches. He is a good student and a good player." 
Tisak's .first experience on the field at Notre Dame Stadium in his junior year was an odd but exciting one, as he did not get to block for quarterbacks Brady Quinn or Jimmy Clausen, but instead he was blocking for for­mer safety Tom Zibikowski. who lined up in the quarterback posi­tion. 
"It was great just trying to open up a hole for Zibby," Tisak said. 
But the experience was more a novel one for Tisak, it was the experience of a lifetime. 
"It was amazing," Tisak said. "You are wearing maybe 20 or 30 pounds of pads, but you don't even feel it. I felt the fastest I have ever been, I felt the lightest I have ever been, and I felt the strongest I have ever been. I went out there and played hard­er than I ever thought I could." 
But what Tisak expects to remember the most when he moves on are the little things, like the relationships he has formed with his teammates. 
"The things you remember the most are just messing around with your teammates," Tisak said. "Trying to survive camp together and just spending all that time together, you cannot help but form strong friend­ships." 
Tisak said some of his best friends on the team are center Thomas Bemenderfer, junior guard Chris Stewart and junior tackle Sam Young, who love to tease him, as all good friends should. 
One of those little things that he will always remember is his nickname, Theodore Gabriel. According to Tisak there is no reason why his teammates call him 'Ted,' but it's a name that stuck. That type of camaraderie and rapport among the ofl"ensive linemen is something that he will keep with him for a long time to come. 

Following his 1-,rraduation, Tisak would like to stick around Notre Dame and try to get into the law school. After that. he may look to join the Association of the United States Army as a lawyer. 
"I want to go to law school,'' Tisak said. I would like to see if I can end up being an AUSA, or something like that. But I want to stick around here." 
When asked what he would like people who knew him here to remember his as, Tisak remained humble. "I want people to remember that I was a good guy,'' Tisak said.

STEVE QUINN 
Linebacker earns larger role in final season of play 
By LORENZO REYES Sports Writer 

Come Saturday, Steve Quinn will walk out of the tunnel at Notre Dame Stadium for the last time as a football player. For the senior linebacker, the experi­ence is one that will surely be a bittersweet moment that will return him to friendly memo­ries.

Part of the reason for the added con­tributions was the switch in defensive philosophy that came when Corwin Brown was appointed as the defensive coor­dinator.

Earlier this season, Quinn picked up a sack that forced a punt against Pittsburgh. Perhaps his most memorable moment of the field, however, dates back to 2006, when he blocked a punt against Southern Cal that sparked a touchdown. 
"Honestly most people, when I tell them who I am, they say, 'Oh are you that kid that blocked the punt at USC,' so I guess that's what I'll remember forever -that I was that kid who blocked that punt at USC," he said with a laugh. 
What he will remember the 
most, however, is the friend­ships that he has acquired through the years in the pro­gram. 
"Oh yeah, I mean, there have been a lot of great guys since I was a freshman, that I've had a lot of fun with," Quinn said. "Guys like [Pat] Kuntz, [Kyle I McCarthy, Robby Parris, some of those guys that I'm close 
with.". As the time winds down on Quinn's career as a football player and graduation looms on the horizon, the senior wants to have a career in federal law enforcement. One thing that 
Quinn can take with him once he ventures into that field is the early mornings he has had to endure at Notre Dame. 
"Getting used to all those early morning workouts," he said. "Getting up early and working hard. I guess in that sense, I'm already ready for the working world." 
So in the near future, if you ever run into an Officer Steve Quinn, be sure to ask him about that kid who blocked that punt at USC in 2006.
