"I called off the SLC elections because I felt like it .. There was no interest in them." Kersten 
SLC vote canned: 'no interest in race,' Kersten declares 
by Anthony Abowd 
SLC elections, originally scheduled for this Thursday, were cancelled indefinitely in an unilateral verbal edict issued by R. Calhoun Kersten, SBP, late last night. . 
"I called off the SLC elections because I felt hke it." the Prime Mover declared. "There was no interest in them and the candidates were un­contested in all but two districts." 
The SBP gave two other reasons for his decisions. "This will give us time to come up with an alter­native to the SLC," Kersten said. "It will also allow the ND women to vote and run for the Board of Commissioners, SLC or its replacement next year." 
Kersten did not set a definite date for the rescheduled elections. "I like to put things off, not think about them, then put them off some more.. The elections will definitely be held before April first next year, " he said. 
The Prime Mover however, would not issue a written statement d~laring the SLC elections will be permanently cancelled until next year. He preferred to rely on his personal integrity that he would not reverse this decision and reinstate elections for this semester 
In other, more personal matter, the SBP cleared up his summer plans. He said he would ascend on May 11 and rule in absentia for three months. All unfinished student government business would be left to Uncandidate the Cat, Student Body Vice­President. 
"I can see no business during the summer that Uncandidate can't handle." Kersten said.

Hesburgh rebuts letter charges 
by Mike Baum 
Assembled members of the faculty and ad­ministration last night heard University President Fr. Theodore M. Hesburgh announce, "We are entering a period of serious crisis, ... endemic to the total cause of American higher education." 
Speaking at the annual President's Dinner, Fr. Hesburgh addressed himself to issues raised by the two recent faculty letters concerning the ad­ministration of the University. 
Stating that as president of the University, "there are two things I must do," Fr. Hesburgh said he wished "to assure all of you that we have not come to the point where consientious advice is not welcome .or can be given only in fear. 
Secondly, Fr. Hesburgh said, "If I must be against anything it is that which polarized this community." Citing the "period of serious crisis" in higher education in this country, Fr. Hesburgh said, "The worst thing that can happen to us during this crisis is to become polarized. The moment we 
become  disunified  - at  that  moment  we  are  
finished."  
Reading  from  his  general  letter  to  faculty  

members, which will be received this week, Fr. Hesburgh stated that he was not "at this time joining issue" with either the first letter, or the reply to it. He noted the current revision of the Faculty Manual, at present in committee. The manual will be discussed extensively by the full Academic Council in the fall, said Fr. Hesburgh, and he felt this "the appropriate time and place for this discussion." 
Carnegie Report 
Enclosed with the letter, will be a copy of the Carnegie Commission report on the state of higher education, dealing with a university's "more .ef­ficient use of resources". In this report, accordmg to Fr. Hesburgh such recent steps ~s the guideli':les on tenuring faculty, and the reglabons on teachmg hours are "minimal proposals for the survival of any institution''. The report is being given specially to the faculty members, and has not yet been released for publication. 
"The fate of higher education is pretty dismal unless the universities are able to discipline themselves" Fr.Hesburghsaid, adding, "only with flexibility, ~trength and humanity can ~e s~rvive." 
Remarking that he wished to "put thmgs m better perspective", Fr. Hesburgh noted that recent at­tacks centered about the Provost, Fr. James T. Burtchaell. "May we discuss principles, not people, and facts, not impressions," he said. 
Quoting a 1970 statement made by Fr. Bu~t~haell, Fr. Hesburgh emphathized, "A good admm1strator should be the major initiator of policy," to be put before the deliberative and advisory bodies to be "tested and tempered". 
In addition he remarked on some of the Provost's less well known achievements, including the initiation of the Notre Dame Report, and the in­stitution of increased fringe benefits for faculty members, and remarked, "The trouble with this job is that you do all the nasty things publicly, and all the nice things quietly." 
Mentioning that he would like to "put myself on the hook", Fr. Hesburgh declared, "I agree with these policies, They may haye proposed by the Provost, but they were proposed with my 

"A good administrator should be the major initiator of policy,"This policy should be put before a body to be "tested and tempered," Hesburgh 
agreement." He offered, "My opinion of ad­ministration is that one should find the best people one can and turn them loose." 
Most Chauvinistic 
Commenting on other events, Fr. Hesburgh said of the merge attempt," We thought it was a good thing to try to do, we all approached it in good will ­it somehow didn't work out." On coeducation, he commented, "I think it is a marvelous thing to be happening here. This is by all odds one of the. most male chauvinist institutes in the world. -It 1s not going to be easy to turn it around. I call upon all of you to get behind this and make it work." 
Fr. Hesburgh aiso announcea we awa. wug from 
the University of several honorary degrees, the 
most familiar name on the list being, perhaps, Vice­
President for Special Projects Sr. Alma Peter. 
Fr. Hesburgh cited Sr. Alma as a woman of 
"great courage and great integrity, somewhat 
maligned by the media here at the University ... a 
person perhaps hurt more by our failure (at 
merger) than anybody else." 

The President's adress was preceeded by a brief talk in praise of the faculty by Edmund Stephan, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, and by the announcement of faculty promotions for 1972 by the 
Provost.

Saigon --Two South Vietnamese fire bases on the approaches to the city of Hue were attacked by North Vietnamese troops as the city itself braced for attack. Big. Gen. Thomas W. Bowen, the sentio American advisor in the region, said that serious attacks could be expected in the next few days. 
Ottowa --The Canadian government announced that all prospective buyers of Canadian businesses worth at least $250,000 and whose revenues exceed $3 million worth would be reviewed at the cabinet level. Unless the review found that the purpose would result in significant benefit to Canada, it would not be permitted. 
Washington--Albet E. Pass, a member of the Executive Board of the United Mine Workers of America, was arrested in Kentucky in connection with the slayings of former Union official Joseph A. Yablonski, his wife and daughter. He is the highest ranking U.M.W. official linked to the murders. 
New York --Three police sergants, 20 patrolmen and one policewoman were arrested after they had been indicted by a Brooklyn Grand Jury on charges of having accepted $250,000 in bribes to protect gamblers. The arrests followed the suicide Monday of a police lieutenant who had been under investigation and, according to District Attorney Eugene Gold, would also have been indicted.

lD Ohio race

for the delegates slates, election officials had agreed to count the votes for the at large slates first. For this reason, it was expected to be some time after the polls were closed before the winning district slates were known. 
Without providing any figures, Secretary of State Ted W. Brown said late in the evening that McGovern was leading in seven districts having 30 delegates and Humphrey in five with 24 delegates. Rep. Wayne Hays, whose favorite-son slate in his 18th district was opposed only by a McGovern,was leading the race for his five delegates. 
One of the few indications of how the blue-collar areas might have voted came from Lorain county, a steel making and auto building region west of Cleveland on Lake Erie. With about a third of the county's precincts accounted for, McGovern had about a 4-to-3 edge over Humphrey. 
The mix-ups at the polling places in populous Cuyahoga County ( theCleveland metropolitan area) led to a Federal Court order ex­tending voting hours there from 
6:30 to 11:59 pm, EDT. Since Cuyahoga casts about 23 percent of the state's Democratic vote, the late closing compounded the slow count and made most political observers hesitant to predict the outcome. 
At least 127 polling places in Cuyahoga County were affected by problems ranging from a failure to receive machines to the loss of keys to unlock them. The machines were being used only in state and local contests. The lengthy lists of convention delegates had required the use of paper ballots because they would not fit on the machines. 
Election workers at some of the polling places would not permit voters to use the paper ballots untl the machines were ready, leading to long lines and discouraging some from casting their vote at all. 
The voting machine problem was only the latest confusing element in this Ohio election.

<c> 1!172 New York Times 

Columbus, Ohio -Senators Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota and George McGovern of South Dakota were locked in a tight race late tonight in a presidential primary contest that was marred by voting machine difficulties in the heavily Democratic Cleveland area. 
The count of the lengthy paper ballot, on which potential delegates to the Democratic National Convention in Miami Beach next July were listed under the names of the candidates to whom they are pledged, was tediously slow. 
!lours after most of the polls had closed, virtually all the available returns were from small towns and rural areas. With only a smat­tering of the count in from the major industrial cities which contain most of the Democratic vote, McGovern and Humphrey were running neck-and-neck. 
Trailing badly were slates representing Sen. Henry M Jackson of Washington, Sen. Edmund S. Muskie of Maine, who had withdrawn from active campaigning, and former Sen. Eugene J. McCarthy of Minnesota, who made only one appearance in the state. 
President Nixon was virtually unopposed in his bid for Ohio's 56 delegates to the Republican convention. 
There was no Presidential preference vote as such. But 38 of the 153 Democratic convention delegates were being selected at large, providing a yardstick to measure popular sentiment on a staewide basis. 
With 3,037 of Ohio's 12,648 precincts reporting, the tally on at­large slates was: 
Humphrey -91,623, McGovern ­86,310, Muskie-22,250, Jackson ­17,845, and McCarthy -5483. 
The remainder of the Democratic delegates wre being elected on slates in the 23 Congressional districts. With the unwieldy paper ballots being used 
Hu1nphrey defeats Wallace in Indiana 
by Seth S. King 
(c) 1972 New York Times 

Indianapolis -Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey won a slight, narrow victory over Governor George C. Wallace in the Indiana Presidential Primary last night. 
The Minnesota Senator tonight was winning at least 49 of Indiana's 76 delegates on the first convention ballot. Wallace was leading six six of the 11 Congressional districts, which would give him 27 delegates. 
With 70 percent of the state's 4480 precincts reporting, Humphrey had 233,691 or 46 percent; Wallace had 212,079 or 42 percent; Muskie had 60,698 or 12 percent. 
ThE> Alabama Governor's per­centage of the total vote was the highest he has held in anyNorthern state and was as large as he won in Florida. 
From the trend developing with more than half the vote in, Hum­phrey appeared to be running well in greater Indianapolis, though Wallace was getting a slightly larger number in some In­dianapolis suburbs, where the possibility of busing school children has been a disturbing problem. 
Wallace, as was expected, was running slightly ahead of Hum­phrey in the Lake County area. But in the city of Gary, with its large black population, the votes had not been counted yet and Mr. Humphrey should draw very well from that area. 
The winner in today's balloting will get the benefit of carrying a medium-sized Midwestern state whose voters represent a typical middle-American mix. 
But the 76 delegates Indiana will send to the Democratic National 
Convention in Miami Beach will be bound by the outcome of today's elecion only on the first ballot of the convention. 'The delegates themselves will not be selected until the Democratic state con­vention in June, and that group may well favor one or several other candidates on later ballots. The winner in each of the state's 11 Congressional districts will get the first-ballot suppor of the delegates apportioned to that district. In addition, the statewide winner will eet the 19 at-large delegates on the 
first ballot There will be 32 Indiana delegates at the Republican National Convention. President Nixon is unopposed on the Republican Primary Ballot and will automatically get all 32. With only Humphrey, Wallace and Sen. EdmundS. Muskie on the Democratic ballot, the choice has been a narrow one. And Muskie's withdrawal last week from active campaigning left many regular Democrats only with the incentive of uniting behind Humphrey to block a Wallace victory. Despite the distraction of campaigning in neighboring Ohio, which also held its presidential primary today, Humphrey has managed to cover about as much of Indiana as Wallace has in the las two weeks. Although busing of school children is a highly emotional issue in Indianapolis and Evansville, and local taxes are as burdensome in Indiana as anywhere else in the country, these questions have not dominated the campaign. Humphrey sought to capitalize 
(Continued on page9) 
It was apparent early in the Ohio race that the shape of the Democratic Presidential contest here would not be discernible until after the crucial primaries in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, which took place last Tuesay. 
Apathy was Widespread, and by the accounts of all camps the undecided vote was extremely high. 
After Muskie withdrew from active campaigning following decisive defeats by McGovern in Massachusetts and Humphrey in Pennsylvania, the confusion multiplied. 
What had been expected to be a three-man race suddenly became essentially a two-way contest. Left stranded without an active can­didate were Gov. John J. Gilligan and most of the other prominent Democrats in the state, who had been on Muskie's delegate lists. 
In a few areas, such as Toledo and Cincinnati, Muskie delegates continued to press for the election fo their at large and district slates, hut the Governor ceased cam­
the shape ·d did not endorse any other candidate. 
Bouyed by their victories last Tuesday, Humphrey and McGovern charged into Ohio and waged a hard fight for the state's delegates. 
McGovern, who originally had not planned to make an all-out effort here, has devoted ,all his time since the Massachusetts primary to the state. 
Humphrey, who was confronting Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama in Indiana today, split his time between Ohio and the neigh­boring Hoosier state, but still managed a strong effort here. 
With more than a million labor union members and a million blacks in Ohio. both contenders directed most of their energies to winning support from among those trdditionally Democratic blocs. 
For McGovern this representd an attempt to cut deeply into what have generally been considered Humphrey strongholds. In con-
McGovern 
centrating on blue-collar workers and blacks, he did not visit a single Ohio college or university, a considerable shift from his usual tactics. 
Both McGovern and Humphrey hammered away at economic issues, with the South Dakotan repeatedly tying the costs of the war in Vietnam to what he termed this nation's inability to solve pressing domestic problems. 

Starting his campaigning here 

Humphrey 
earlier than the other candidates Jackson campaigned hard in the state, spending most of his time in the last two weeks in what would be considered the more con­servative working-class districts in rural areas. By the end of his drive, his principal theme was an attack onMcGovern for what he termed his leftist positions an on Humphrey for assertedly having failed to make his stand on the issues clear.

Have the SLC vote •1n September 
The upcoming SLC elections have been called off. The obviously (and painfully) apparent reason is that only two of the new election districts have an actual race. Districts V and VI of the six divisions are the races contested. 
It would be a mockery of the entire election process to ballot when four people (out of the eight of which the commission will be com­prosed) are running uncontested. 
Better to hold the elections three weeks after the next term begins. This will not only give more time for the possible candidates to consider issues and plans, but it will facilitate in better representation in that it will allow incoming freshmen and the women who will be living here next year to take an active role in the elections for the Student Life Commission. 
In addition, since Bob Kersten has proposed a plan which will greatly limit the number of­people who take part in the running of Student Government, this election takes on tremendous importance. The eight people elected assume effective control of Student Government. They should be elected at a time when the entire student body can take an effective part in their election. 
Since March 1, games have been played with, and at the expense of student government. A point must be reached where the people playing those games come to the realization that they are playing with real people and situations, not chess pieces on a board. To have the elections for commissioners now would only prolong the game. Hopefully, some type of effective reality in the running of student government can be reached by next year.

A sadness in the family 
tiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiUIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII C. L. Sulzberger 
(c) 1972 New York Times News Service 
Rome--The saddest aspect of Italy's current election campaign, which ends with a critical vote on Sunday, is the pattern of violence and organized terrorism on its fringes of extremism, particularly that of the revolutionary left. 
This is especially tragic because it can have no serious influence on the outcome and because the left-wing youngsters chiefly involved are in fact working against their own interests by encouraging a reactionary backlash and addind strength to the small but growing new-Fascist movement. 
Almost certainly the balloting will demonstrate once more that almost two-thirds of the electorate backs a center-dominated coalition which, after much bickering, will again be led by the stodgy Christian Democrats while the main opposition continues to be the sclerotic, if massive, communist party. 
The youthful extremists, numbers of whom come from prosperous and cultivated families, are therefore expending blood and dreams on a chimera employing the Italian personal trait of individualism fuitlessly against the Italian national trait of lassitude. 
Yet many a family has been riven by this phenomenon and few more unhappily than that of Luigi Barzini, the brilliant author, journalist, and liberal party politician. Barzine's two sons are deeply committed to "workers' power," one of the most violent of the "Gruppuscoli," as the revolutionary factions are known, and one of the youngsters is in a Sicilian prison, charged with distributing incendiary pamphlets. 
Barzine's step-son by an earlier marriage, Giangiacomo Feltrinelli, a blazingly successful publisher famed for issuing the first edition in any language of Pasternak's "Doctor Zhivago," was passionately committed to the terrorist left. He was killed in a mysterious explosion this spring, apparently while preparing to blow up power pylons near Milan. 
In a deeply moving reflection, Barzini-a political conservative­recalls: "I myself was a rebel against the Italian academic, bourgeois, provincial habits."and yet, he adds: "Perhaps we could not understand each other because we were utterly different... 
"He was that kind of man who is common in Italy and who is able to go from an extremist movement <Fascism) to the opposite (Communism) provided it be illiberal and mythological, without stopping at the stage of the ideas <maybe boring and too serious because they don't promise any miracles but only toil) of the bourgeois revolution, of freedom laboriously conquered and defended every day, allow problems to be faced and gradually solved, tolerating--or rather extracting and using--what is valid as dissident and heretical movements." 
After Feltrinelli joined the communists, Barzini observed: "That he would have abandoned the party as soon as he would have felt its discipline, its control, its constraints, and as soon as he would have noticed that it was not an organization of terrorists and dynamiters, spreading the corpses of foes in the streets at night, but a vast, cautious, and erudite movement treasuring 50 years of defeats in every country determined to win while avoiding a catastrophic civil war (for Italy's and for its own sake,) was clear to anyone who knew him ... 
"It is not important to know if Giangi died as the victim of a secret plot or because he made an error in charging electricity into the dynamite. The secret plot is always a fascinating explanation for the right-wing or the left-wing political fans ... 
"Giangi died because of his ideas and it is negligible now to see whether they were just, practical, or foolish. It is impossible not to feel respect for his sacrifice ... Pisacane (a hero of the Risorgimento) also met his death with courage and levity, under the illusion he could provoke an im­mediate revolution that would never be stopped." 
And so it is with today's Italy, a country where the ties of kinship are exceptionally strong and where one after another family is split by the political generation gap with youngsters spilling blook in the name of "worker's vanguard" and "continuous battle" on the way-out left, and "black bombers," "young Italy" and "people's struggle" on the way-out right. 
Meanwhile, amid its weeping mothers and puzzled fathers, Italy will almost certainly vote to continue the kind of inept, confused, moderate coalition government that, with much bewilderment, has been creeping for a quarter of a century--creeping slowly and hesitantly forward.

the mystery of the countryside 
The mystery of the countryside unfolded during a time of loss. The lonely visit to Rock House. A cave edged on all sides by freedom. <Sparse inhabitants treated her carefully, lovingly. They would know if they lost her.) The house and the freedom around her, all a living allegory. <One versed in allegories would perhaps be forced to invent, create, such a truth.) After all, I am naked here and not living here, visiting. "Did you see the living of this beauty, and how death had already counted you victim?" I admitted, "Yes, Sir, the life here doesn't appear to care who I am." <Although appearing as a catalyst.) Truth­fully, Sir, I couldn't work or change or grow without this catalyst." (a totally human condition.) "They are we seem to be," I always thought the Earth dead but molten. Life doesn't care, it's more than enough. 
The tragedy of a life lost is evident here. 
In particular observations of self and its relationship tothe world, I am particularly aware of sound, the audbile. Vibration, dancing, prancing through the air, to give pleasure, to warm, Sounds are clouded and not in any framework of empirical ob­servations. The rustling of a windswept forest, inside and outside, the sound of God, one. A million leaves harmonizing. Tom Thurber 
I awoke and greeted the morning. I waved, the sun is climbing, singing its, so far away, heated silent song. Every mor­ning, everyday. Some mornings, some days, the sun appears as god's hole in the sky. It moves from morning till night, catching the constant glimpse of our living planet. The brightness is often dismayed of what he sees. Clouds, rain, cleansing. In the morning, we will be judged. 
Never permanently. 
Today I approached the sun as a glorious, mysterious friend. This pagan god. Was she singing or only fooling. I looked at her at times already blinded, the voices sang louder. the sun grew hotter, brighter. The 
tom thurber 
sound rang from a chorus. Millions of suns, as with all loudness, I went indoors and fell a sleepful bliss. 
I awoke in the morning with blood on my tail. In my field there was, always the clash : the prophet as artist and the artist as prophet. The earth, the Renaissance, commanded recent centuries. The link was near. 
The new epic. Men found the key to God. Growth, dreams. "Realitv was the past." Speculative futures. "Everything is everything" Love and hate became mere pleasure, not understanding. Boarding a new ark above a hollow earth. We all boarded that ark, illusions we did not see. A few stayed behind to battle the new, to change the day. 
Until the holocaust. 
I awoke this morning,as I had many mornings before, remembering how I had died among and with the rest. It was a time, I recalled, not in days or years, when all artists died. <We had created illusions, the punishment severe) Howling, begging for forgiveness, a tiny new fire. I couldn't remember the ones who died or the ones who lived. The close contact I once favored had left but not me. 
I wandered. 
I walked near Rock House again and heard a rhythmn unlike that of nature, ordered rhythm. In the source, I found three humans. One drumming, one weaving, one lost. The weaver is filled with child. The lost one cheered. Welcome lover, you are one of us." 
I asked the drummer, "What have you found after the holocaust?" "Brother, a few are dreaming, but now they are living l-iving is a mystery 
"Brother, a few are dreaming, but how they are living is a mystery to us. Like us, they must be alone and frightened, losing similarities. The earth is young again in our dreams, creation, a matter of course, our natural vocation. We need no pondering. Please join us ! ! It's spring now time to live again.

1n search of a hero 
(c) 1972 New York Times 
Washington -A scant four years into the future and we shall be hip deep in a nightmare of American Government: 1976 -the 20oth anniversary of the American ­Oh boy! 
A 200th anniversary cannot be ignored or whistled away. Aniversaries are as American as the greeting card industry and counter-revolutionary police heroes. 
They must be celebrated, even when they are anniversaries of-dare we breathe the word -revolutions. 
Government, ever alert to menace, has taks forces deployed, trying to arrange something rousing yet dull for the oc­casion. Little has been accomplished so far because the task forces have been too busy investigating their members to make sure they all hate revolution. Many, many meetings are held, however; meetings of groups . like the Task Force on heroes, chaired by Art Basom of the White House Staff. 
Bascom opened last week's meeting by asking if anybody had come up with any genuine revolutionary heroes who could be celebrated in 1976 without giving people the idea that revolutionaries could get away with any rough stuff. Perkins suggested Reginald Blintz Quimper. 
Blintz-Quimper, it seems, was an off­duty policeman in Boston during the time streeet mobs used to treat private property with wanton disrespect. "one day," Perkins said, "Blintz-Quimper saw a lawless mob swarm aboard a ship in Boston Harbor. It was loaded with tea. Private property. With no respect at all for the tea, the mob began dumping it into the water." 
"Where was the National Guard?" asked Bascom. 
"The forces of law and order were handcuffed by indecisive leadership and a series of court decisions that made it very hard for police to get confessions from men who threw tea into harbors," Perkins said. 
Blintz-Quimper happened to be passing the adjacent ship, Mary Anne, which had a large cargo of sugar, at the moment one of the mob said, "Let's go for the Mary Anne." Blintz-Quimper, who could't stand people who put sugar in tea, drew his flintlock and threatened to shoot anybody who failed to treat the sugar with respect. 
"There were men of courage in those days," Bascom murmured,"but the guys sounds to me like he might have wound up on the King's side. That hyphenated name -Bhntz-Quimper. A guy with a name like 
that could have wound up sitting in the 
House of Lords." 
The task force voted to run a security 
check on Blintz-Quimper, and then took up 
the case ofHansHarschenholtz, a German 
mercenary who single-handedly captured 
seven soldiers from Washington's army 
one wintry night near Valley Forge. 
"Hans Harschenholtz. German mer­
cenary," Bascom objected. "I don't like 
the image."' 
"The image is almost perfect," said 
Humpsenhorn. 
"When Hans brought the seven men into 
the light of his campfire, he saw that their 
clothes were filthy.' They smelled terrible, 
because they had not bathed in weeks. 
Their hair was down to their shoUlder 
blades. And do you know what Hans said to 
them?" 

"Tell me." 
"He told them that he was going to send them all to Trenton for 30 days unless they 
agreed to wash, put on clean pants and 
cut their hair so that it was no more than 
two inches long at the forelock, didn't 
come below eye-level at the sideburns and 
was two inches above the collar in the 
back." 

Bascom said he liked the image but 
wondered if Harschenholtz had stayed on 
in America after the revolution to live by 
the work ethic or gone back to Ger_ptany 
and heirs who fell in with the Kaiser. 
The task force wasn't doing enough 
investigating, he complained. "Which 
reminds me. Has anybody had any fresh 
thoughts about the George Washington 
problem?'' 

Everyone looked very glum about 
h;;lVing to deal with this notorious 
revolutionary. "Face it," said Henreddy, 
"this guy has a record that makes Abbie 
Hoffman look like a pillar of the establish­
ment." 

"If we don't put him on the official 
certified US Approved List of Heroes, we'll 
be laughed at by the liberals," said Molch. 
"It's the right wing we have to watch," 
said Tancroft. "They're already so mad 
about China that they will start a third 
party if the President comes out for 
George Washington." 
"George Washington gives me a pain," 
said Bascom. "If he didn't like America, 
why didn't he go to Russia?" 
"And yet," said Budding, 
"revolutionary though he was, he was still 
a slave owner." 
Bascom squinted, hummed and smiled. 
"I like it," he said. "I like the image."

At this time of year, the old saw reminds us, a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts other than calculus and microbiology, or even baseball. As I walk across campus this spring, it occurs to me that it is not the prerogative of just the young men to be thinking about girls, nor can it be a matter of playful daydreaming. By the time these now-budding leaves are getting ready to fall, the University of Notre Dame will have become a coed institution. 
Of course, there have always been some women around--mothers visiting their sons, hometown girls in for the big games, staff personnel brightening up the day with that special feminine touch. And in recent years we've grown steadily accustomed to seeing Saint Mary's students just about everywhere on the campus, to having them in classes, to regarding them an integral and very attractive part of Notre Dame life. But come September, the University will become coed. There will be undergraduate women living on the campus. Undoubtedly, there will be an increasing number of professional women in faculty and ad­ministrative posts. And in a short time the women attending Alumni Club functions will not necessarily be there as wives or guests of Notre Dame graduates, but in their own right. 
I find myself wondering what the presence of women as Notre Dame students will mean--really mean. How will a coed Notre Dame affect us men, change our lives, alter familiar patterns? What will it ask of us and what will it give us? What will we have to learn about ourselves, our society, our educational presumptions in sustained contact with women? And what of the women themselves? How will their lives as women be shaped by the experience of coming to Notre Dame? How will the development of their minds and attitudes be related to their life here? How will they feel and respond to being the first, and relatively small group, of undergraduate women? 
I don't have the answers to such questions right now; I'm not sure anybody does. I'm musing out loud--and inviting all of us to do it. No big campaign. Spring evenings are for reflection and quiet discussions. I'm simply saying that there are many dimensions to be explored, many aspects to be thoughtfully considered if the Notre Dame community takes seriously the change which is about to occur. And I ex­plicitly want to invite the Saint Mary's 


Dr. James Massey 


A faculty letter, from overseas 
women to share in these reflections. Geography, history, programs, activities, human relationships have always made Saint Mary's women part of Notre Dame life. That's not going to be changed by the fact of women undergraduates at the University. I would hope that foolish myths creating rivalries never get started, and that friendships among women living on both sides of the highwlway will flourish. 
Notre Dame has an an Advisory Com­mittee on Coeducation, and specific recommendations will be forthcoming shortly. But the Committee has already suggested that the task of coeducation is broader than some of us may have thought, and the implications more far-reaching, as they have found out already at Princeton and Yale. And above all, the Committee insists, the transition to coeducation is everybody's responsibility. The University may need some structural modifications and personnel! additions to make it work smoothly, but fundamentally the healthy integration of women into Notre Dame depends on attitudinal adjustments and processes of communication. The problems are not unlike those already faced in the admission of increasing numbers of minority students. 
This means that all of us connected with this traditionally male University are going to have to take a long, hard, and perhaps critical look at our assumptions and presuppositions. In some circles that used to be called examination of conscience. But whatever you name the process, it demands time, reflection, dialogue, discernment, and openness to change. 
If we men at Notre Dame have to writhe through some searching questions about inveterate predispositions and prejudices, however, there is also a brighter side to the task. A community which tries seriously to assess what a specific change in its life may mean, may thereby be led to breakthroughs in unsuspected areas. For instance, I'm thinking that if Notre Dame men really come to grips with the question of com­munication between themselves and the women on campus, seeking to establish conditions favorable to it and to minimize obstacles, they necessarily touch a human problem. In other words, the context for considering friendship between men and women will become the larger matter of what is at stake between persons whether male or female, black or white, American or Vietnamese. Or to take another example, raising the issue of educational changes in view of educating women simply opens up tbe-tlastc question of education itself-from­another perspective. And that seems healthy, too. I've suggested some con­siderations for your musings. I would also like to recommend that we set up some structures to continue reflection and dialogue on the topic. A lot, it seems to me, could be done through panels and discussions in the halls. But why not also use the forum of the classroom? There is no time left this semester, but perhaps faculty might consider giving a class or at least part of one to discussion of the situation of Notre Dame going coed and all that entails when classes resume in the Fall. 

A professor may wish to raise the issue within the context of the particular discipline, or more generally. There is plenty of imagination around; let's use it. The Committee on Coeducation is compiling a list of resource persons, mainly interested women already associated with the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's community, who would be willing to assist if called upon. Utilizing such assistance would be one concrete step forward. 
I'm sure that everyone here among Notre Dame faculty and students will have something to offer and something to gain during this transitional period. We can face this new opportunity, as we have faced so many others, as a community. We'll never quite be the same again, but hopefully, better--vive Ia difference. 
The voice of the Observer is heard across the Atlantic! 
While the signers of the letter intitled "The Future of Notre Dame" <which appeared in your Ides of March number) include many whom I consider Notre Dame's finest faculty members and several of my closest friends, I am still compelled to register my complete disagreement with the thesis of that letter. This thesis in a nutshell is that Notre Dame is converging toward a Fourth Reich whose Hitler will be the Rev. James T. Burtchaell, C.S.C., (now merely Provost)­although in keeping with the hallowed academic tradition of obliqueness Burt­chaell's name appears nowhere in the body of the letter. 
The main evidence adduced for this thesis by the nearly anonymous writer were the four following items: 
<I l The alleged future "increased work load" on the faculty resulting fom the Provost's recent decree of the "new twelve-hour equivalent teaching load" <the cowing of the Reaichstag. l Ignoring the fact that when I joined the Notre Dame faculty in 1962 I was told that the standard teaching load was 12 hours <and in fact I taught 14 hours, including a 3 hour night class. in both semesters of that year l. I must point out that the actual teaching load cannot increase unless either the student body is signifieantly increased or the faculty is significantly decreased--two most unlikely event. The decree of a 40 hour teaching load would be equally irrelevant to the actual load. I believe that the Provost intended his rule as a yard­stick for measuring the contributions of individual faculty members. This is a standard rand I believe wisel practice in the other distinguished universities within my acquaintance. and is used to even out the load on individuals. All too often at Notre Dame. it is the same people who do the most <and most effective) teaching, who do the most research. and who do the most supervision of student research. Yet, at present, these O''erworked people are generally required to do the same amount of academic housekeeping <registration duties, service on time-consuming minor committees, etc.) as their more leisured brethren. 


(21 The alleged creation of an elite <the Nazis l among the faculty to follow from the Provost's recently announced rule that at least one-half and no more than two­thirds of the faculty in any department shall be tenured. The writer concludes that "When the number of available places is fixed. those who have them and those who want them are bound to be in tension." To me. the contrary conclusion is obvious. If there is to be any change <which I doubt) :n !h:~ relations between the tenured and non-tenured faculty resulting from this ruie. it will be more bootlicking by the latter of the former as the non-tenured faculty members jockey for the favor of the Appointments and Promotions Committee on which only the tenured may serve. I happen to think that this new rule is a wise one provided it is regarded as a norm to be approached and is open to exception with sufficient justification. It will tend to cause a balanced distribution of ages in the departmental faculty with a preponderance neither of greybeards nor Young Turks. One must admit, however, 
that this rule will indeed place a greater psychological strain on the non-tenurea faculty. hut I believe this is a necessary evil in the fjrst-rate university. It also places the onus on the tenured faculty as members of the same university and Christian community to lessen this strain by all possible means. We might profit from the secular example of M.I.T. (which has a much more restrictive tenure policy than ours) which includes among its faculty benefits several free visits to a psychiatrist. I do not make this suggestion facetiously. Notre Dame has not yet come to grips with the real mental strains on both faculty and students in the first­rate university which we have only lately become. 
<3l The introduction by the Provost of the mandatory course evaluation system which will allegedly "corrupt good teaching cthe Gestapo system.)

In fact. I cannot imagine how 30 of my faculty colleagues could sign a letter which alleged that "One's preparation for class ... or one's knowledge of the schoiarship in his field ... can be easily faked". a claim which is entirely contrary to all my experience.

(Continued from page 3) 
Hoover took charge of assembling a card file on 450,000 "radicals," and built his first informer net­work --a controversial tool of police work that he used with dramatic results later against the Communist Party and the Ku Klux Klan. 
When Harlan Fiske Stone became Attorney General under President Collidge in 1924, he determined to rebuild the Bureau after the image of Scotland yard and sought, as his director, a man experienced in police work but free of the "more 1 usual police tradition that it takes a crook to catch a crook and that lawlessness and brutality are more to be relied upon than skill and special training." 
Stone, who held the appointive power, offered him the job. But Hoover, who was then only 29 years old, did not leap at what was unmistakably the chance of a lifetime. 
With confidence and cunning that were very much in character, Hoover reportedly said he would accept the assignment only if appointments to the Bureau were divorced entirely from outside politics and if he would have sole control over merit promotions. Stone replied that he would not 
Support expected 
for Development 
Walk on May 13 
by Stan Podlasek 
Project workers are reported to be optimistic about recieving support from Notre Dame and S. Mary's students for the Mishawaka Development Walk to be held Saturday May 13. 
Larry Maloney, a teacher at St. Mary's Academy working on the project, said registration for the walk would begin 8 o'clock Saturday at Pottawatomi Park, located at Mishawaka Ave. and Ironwood Dr. 
The walk is one of many spon­sored acrosss the country by the National Hunger Agency. ­Students are asked to find people willing to sponsor them for mile rates, and then walk as much of the 25 mile route as they can. 
Money collected will be distributed by this rate: 15 percent to finance the walk; 42.5 percent for local projects; 42.5 percent for foreign projects. 
Local projects will include an experimental juvenile delinquent program for boys in Indiana Boys' Homes, a health program on West Washington St., and equipment and food for a Day Care Center. Money will· be spent "ltbroad in Equador, Mozambique, and Bangladesh. 
One of the reasons mentioned by Maloney for ND-SMC participation is, ''fantastic public relations: people along the route are frien­dly." Approximately 2000 people , mostly high school,participated in last year's walk. Officials hope that with help from ND-SMC, IUSB' and a reported higher turn­out in Mishawaka, twice that number will walk this year.

Policemen indicted in New York City 

by Morris Kaplan 
<cl 1972 New York Times 
New York -Three police sergeants, 20 patrolmen and one patrolwoman were arrested and suspended from the police department today after they were indicted and accused of taking a quarter of a million dollars in payoffs to protect gamblers linked to the mafia. 
The arrests under what was called the largest single in­dictment ever handed up here against members of the police force followed by a day the suicide of a police lieutenant under in­vestigation who shot himself in the head in a rented hotel room. 
The lieutenant, Fletcher Hueston, had been second in command of the Public Morals

Squad of the 13th division in Brooklyn, the unit to which each of the individuals named in the in­dictment had been assigned during some portion of the past 18 months. 
Kings County District Attorney Eugene Gold, who was joined by Deputy Police Commissioner William P. McCarthy in an­nouncing the charges, said that the 44-year-old lieutenant who joined the force in November 1955, would have been indicted. 
Gold said that each of ths patrolmen allegedly implicated in the operation that involved 40 gamblers and bookmakers had profited by about $10,000 a year, while superiors received between $15,000 and $20,000 a year.

activities as policy, horseracing 
and other sports events, were said 
to have amounted to $1 million in 
four years. 

Each of the suspects was 
identified as having conspired to 
receive bribes and promote 
gambling in addition to having 
received "rewards for official 
misconduct." 

All the defendants are or were 
assigned to plainclothes patrol in 
the 13th division, which en­
compasses four precincts in the 
Brownsville, Bedford-Stuyvesant, 
Fort Greene and Cumberland 
sections of Brooklyn. 

According to Gold, the in­
dictment resulted from an in­
vestigation that began late in 1970 
and was intensified with the 
assistance of undercover 
policemen who infiltrated the 
Public Morals Squad. 

The strength of the squad varied 
and at its peak totaled 25. Of the 17 
persons currently assigned, 10 
were indictated and Hueston, of

Good-by and good luck . 
the Irish to victory in the opener, while Riddell came back to limit the Chargers to just four safeties in taking the nightcap. 
The Irish wasted no time in jumping on top in the first game. After Dick Nussbaum flew out, Pete Schmidt walked and Ken Rump bounced a ground-rule double over the center field fence. Joe LaRocca then lifted a high fly to left field that Chuck Krymwiede dropped, and Schmidt walked in with the unearned marker. 
Notre Dame was the victim of poor calls by the umpires in the third. With two out, Schmidt and Rump were on base via walks. Reschan followed by belting a 1-0 pitch out of the park for what looked like his seventh home run of the season. 
Center fielder Stan Nirider was in pursuit, and lifted his glove to signal that the ball had not flown the fence, making a ground rule double mandatory. · The umpire bought the story, and only Schmidt scored as Rump was held up at. third base. 
Ken Schuster was hit by a pitch to load the bases, and Tom Hansen followed with a line shot that seemingly cleared the barrier in left center. This time, the man-in­blue ruled that the ball had gone through a hole in the snow fence that serves as the boundary, and instead of a grand slam another two bagger was awarded and only two runs came home. 
The only serious threat to Eich's 
lead came in the final stanza. An 
error by Schuster and two walks 
loaded the bases with two down, 
but Eich got catcher Doug Felmar 
to line out to Hansen and end the 
game. 

Eich garnered his second shutout of the year, but was not entirely pleased with his pitching. "My fast ball was better than it was at Butler, but my curve ball wasn't really up to par," Eich noted. "I got good support in the field, though, and I'm just happy we won." 
Riddell again looked good in mastering the Chargers as he fanned six and walked just two to lower his team leading ERA to 
3.83. The right-hander looked particularly superb when trouble arose in the fifth inning. 
A walk and Archie Robinson's double put men at second and third with only one out, but Riddell got left fielder Dick Stuckey to pop out to Reschan, then fanned second baseman Don MacGillivray to put out the fire. 
Spring sports enter final full weekend 
Notre Dame's spring sports teams head into their final full weekend of activity with only the baseball and tennis teams slated for home appearances. 
The Irish baseballers, now 11-13 going into today's doubleheaders with Michigan, will host Bowling Green for three games Friday and Saturday. 
The tennis team will battle Eastern Michigan and Kalamazoo College at home on Saturday and then Illinois and Ohio State Sunday in the regular season finales. 
Another home attraction Saturday is the annual Blue and Gold spring football game in Notre Dame Stadium. Ara Parseghian's ninth annual spring contest could attract upwards of 20,000 spec­tators if the weatherman decides to co-operate. Kickoff is 1:30pm <EST>. 
The ND golfers will compete in the highly competitive Northern Intercollegiate at Indiana University Friday and Saturday while the trackmen conclude their regular season yesterday at the Big State meet in Lafayette, Ind. 
Notre Dame's tennis team-with individual victories from No. 1 man Buster Brown 00-6), Mike Reilly 02-3), Brandon Walsh (13­3), and Rob Schefter (11-4) ­captured its second straight Huskie Invitational title at Nor­thern Illinois last week, finishing 14 points ahead of second place Indiana State. 
The Irish golfers placed second in their own 11-team invitation tourney last weekend. Junior Marty Best leads the squad with a 77.'J average but he and the entire team will face its toughest com­petition of the season in the Nor­thern Intercollegiate Tournament ­probably the major tourney for Midwestern college golfers. 
Track coach Alex Wilson was disappointed with the per­formances at the Drake Relays. Ace high hurdler Tom McMannon gained the finals but his 14.2 effort was five tenths of a second off his best of the season. The shuttle hurdle relay team was also nosed out in the semi-finals. Freshman shot putter Greg Cortina did ac­complish a third place at the Penn Relays and his 59-5% mark was an Irish outdoor high this spring. 


Riddell started the scoring himself with a leadoff single in the third. The games were played under "speed-up" rules which allow a designated pinch runner for either the pitcher or catcher, so freshman Dave Mattingly came on to man the base paths for Riddell. 
Nussbaum moved Mattingly to second with a sacrifice, then Sch­midt walked and Rump singled to load the bases. LaRocca followed by chopping a single past the closely drawn infield to score Mattingly for a 1-o Irish ad­vantage. 
ND picked up two more tallies in the fifth Ql1 a walk, an error, and singles by Howard Wood and Bob Roemer, and Hansen capped the scoring with his second home run of the year, a soaring blast over the center field fence that led off the seventh. 
The Irish, 11-13 on the year will conclude the 1972campaignwith six of their last seven games at Cartier Field. Ed Hrabcsak and Jim Noe will start in a double-header against Michigan this afternoon, with game time for the opener slated at 1 PM. Bowling Green then comes in for a single game Friday and a twinbill Saturday, while the season ends next week with single games at Western Michigan Monday and at home to Valparaiso Tuesday.

(Continued from page B) writer states, his departmental chairman and his dean are aping the style of the Provost, and if that style is dictatorial, then I submit that the fault is theirs, not the Provost's, and these two apes should be removed as speedily as possible from their positions of authority, The above fantasies being set aside, I affirm my agreement with the underlying tone of the writer's letter, namely that the voice of the Notre Dame faculty is in­sufficiently strong in matters of University policy. Disagreeing with the writer, I assert that the blame for this sorry state of affairs rests 100 per cent with the faculty itself. For instance, the Academic Council (which under the provisions of the Faculty Manual is the prime instrument for regulating the acadmic life of the University) is a moribund body simply because the bulk of the faculty members of this body do no homework in preparation for its meetings. For several years, I served on the Steering Committee of the Academic Council. During this period, all save one of the legislative items proposed by the Steering Committee were accepted in toto by the Council. The reason--the members of the Steering Committee had necessarily done a good deal of homework while preparing the legislation and were 
able quite easily to counter any objections offered by the other members of the Council (many of whom did not even read the legislation prior to the Council meeting. l The one blemish on the record of the Steering Committe~ occurred at the emergency Council meeting caiied after "Kent State week." The Steering Com­mittee prepared legislation calling for amnesty for all class absences during that week, the revival of the grades I (in­complete, to be made up by the fall semester) and W (withdrawal), but not calling for permission of a student to drop out of a course at that time (with a month of the semester remaining) and to be given the grade he was currently maintaining. Although every faculty member on the Council whom I had lobbied with in ad­vance of the meeting took an "over my dead body" attitude to the Steering Committee's proposals, the Council ac­tually adopted them together with the provJston not recommended by the Steering Committee. The reason: This provision was among those presented by a group of student leaders whom Fr. Hesburgh had invited to the meeting and these students had done their homework exceedingly well (right down to getting the first haircuts, wearing a coat and tie for the first time, and perhaps even bathing 

for the first time in four year--there were several whom I could not recognize in their new disguise.) 
I believe also that the blame for our being so far from a Christian community rests largely with the faculty. Again I cite one specific example. For several years I have been urging the Faculty Affairs Committee of the Faculty Senate to proposed to the Administration the ex­tension of the educational benefits now provided for the children of active faculty members to the children of deceased or disabled faculty members with the additional cost to be borne by reducing slightly the benefit to all so that there would be no increased cost to the University. The committee has con­sistently refused to take this proposal to the floor of the senate (even though I consider it the barest possible response to the members of our community in the greatest needl on the grounds that the onus lies on the Administration to find the new funds needed to extend the present benefit to all. So goeth faculty initiaitve at Notre Dame. 
As I close this letter. I must say that our Provost is a man of many talents and much intelligence but it would be foolish to say that he has no faults whatsoever. Without denigration. I believe that I can 
still say that he is (a) brash, (b) overly self-confident, and (c) obstinate. This latter characteristic is the one I believe which has aroused the most dissension within the faculty. While I think the Provost during is first year of office absolutely needed to be very inflexible and to stick by his decisions if his office were to become the "buck stops here" sort of place that had been envisioned, I believe that he can now be more flexible since his superpower status is assured. 
But one fault which I absolutely insist that the Provost (nor any other member of the Adminsitration within my acquain­tance l does not possess is vindictiveness. Again I fail to see how my colleagues could have endorsed the writer's paranoia and that of his "friends" who "disssuaded <him l from risking, on today's campus, an open disclosure of (his) views." Lest any think that my "open disclosure" here, including its criticism of the Provost, is made only from the security of tenure which I enjoy, I make the following pledge: Should this letter be printed by the Observer, then at any time upon the presentation of a request to that effect 
signed by the Rev. James T. Burtchaell, C.S.C., Provost, I will tender my resignation from the University at the end of the then current academic year.
