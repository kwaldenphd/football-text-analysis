HUD secretary seeks immunity 
WASHINGTON (AP) -House investigators said Thursday they will seek immunity for a onetime top housing official in exchange for tes­timony about agency grants and contracts un­der former HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce Jr. 
Sources said the investigators are seeking tes­timony that Pierce made politically tainted con­tract awards while secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development during the Reagan administration. 
The former official, Dubois Gilliam, is serving a federal prison sentence for a conviction in a HUD-related case. 
Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., chairman of the House subcommittee that has been investigating HUD for nearly a year, said at a news confer­ence Gilliam "was a key player" in awarding HUD grants under several programs, including the secretary's discretionary fund. 
"He will provide information that is otherwise unavailable to the subcommittee and is critical to our investigation of HUD," Lantos said. 
"Mr. Gilliam's testimony will open new areas not dealt with previously by the subcommittee," said Lantos.

offer an opportunity for the Notre Dame community to fo­cus on the achievements and contributions that women have made to society and education," said Kolman. 
The year will focus on re­search and scholarship by women and achievements of women on the Notre Dame campus. It will highlight the changing role of women in soci­ety, said Kolman. 
"The Year of the Woman will build on what we have been working on for the past two years," said Kolman. The "Year of Cultural Diversity" was cele­brated at Notre Dame in 1988­89, and the "Year of the Fam­ily" is being observed during 1989-90. 
LAST ISSUE 
This is the last regular is­sue of The Observer before Spring Break. The Observer will resume publication on Tuesday, March 20. The Observer wishes everyone a fun and safe Spring Break. 
President Bush announced a national transportation pol­icy Thursday that would cost travelers more and increase local governments' share in meeting air. land and sea travel needs into the next century. 
Just as the Model T and the Wright brothers' plane "prepared the way for to­day's millions of cars and thousands of passenger jets, so it is now our turn to in­vest in America's future," Bush said in unveiling the policy with Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner. 
Bush said it would help keep America "the world leader in transportation." 
The 129-page plan, "Moving America Into The 21st Century," calls for more toll roads. local gas taxes, user fees, private invest­ments, competition, deregu­laton, research into futuris­tic systems and openness to foreign air carriers as well as increased attention to safety and protection of the environment. 
The policy was hailed as an important step by some in-pressed some disappoint­ment, and Democratic mem­bers of Congress were criti­cal. 
Aviation and ground trans­portation groups opposed "user fees" and other taxes that Skinner acknowledged would require travelers to pay more. The American Public Transit Association said the policy was "long on advice and short on help" from the federal govern­ment. 
Rep. Norman Mineta, D­
Calif., chairman of the House surface transportation sub­committee, called it "a good start" but said shifting pro­grams to the state and local level without financial re­sources "would be the shift and the shaft." 
Bush did not immediately field questions on the pro­posal, leaving Skinner to face news media. 
The secretary, who had the policy drawn up after hold­ing 117 hearings across the country. justified proposals for increases in local gaso­line taxes and fees by saying polls show that people are provements. 

Skinner denied the policy represents a shift of respon­siblity for transportation away from the federal gov­ernment, saying it was an at­tempt to "strike a balance" after years in which the fed­eral government has as­sumed "almost all of the re­sponsibility" for funding some transportation sys­tems. 
"The federal commitment to infrastructure and to transportation will continue to be at a very high level," he said, adding that federal transportation budgets are expected to increase each year. 
"It is not the panacea or the answer to all of the prob­lems in transportation," said Skinner. "It was never de­signed to be that. It was de­signed to be a strategic plan, or a framework under which we could make the many de­cisions that we are required to make."

The 1990-91 academic year has been designated the "Year of the Woman" at the Univer­sity of Notre Dame by Father Edward Malloy, University president. 
In announcing the obser­vance, Malloy also identified the committee charged with de­veloping a schedule and coordi­nating activities during the year. Chaired by Associate Provost Eileen Kolman, the committee includes 15 other people from the administration, faculty, and student body. 
The committee will meet by the end of March to develop more specific and detailed plans for activities. It will schedule which speakers they will invite to campus, according to Kolman, chairperson for the committee. 
Throughout the rest of the semester, the committee will be meeting once or twice a month and various sub-committees will be generated to work on some particular projects and topics, said Kolman.

INSIDE COLUMN 


Stoking the fire, making love, and editing a paper 
"There are three things that no one can do to the entire satisfaction of every­one involved: stoke the fire, make love, and edit a newspa­per," a famous editor 


once said. Chris Donnelly 
Today's issue of The Observer is the last Editor-in-Chief one for which I will serve as editor and I am pleased with the job we have done. The year was full of new experiences and we have all learned a lot. 
Indeed, if there is one thing that I have learned in the past year is that almost ev­eryone thinks they could run The Observer better than we did, and some of them may even be right. 
I've oftnn said that the only thing The Obsflfvnr and The New York Times have in common is that we both make mistakes. I'll bn the first to admit that The Observer is far from perfect, and I don't mind nvery­one's criticisms because it is through these that we grow and improve. 
I do believe, however, that all things considered our part-time staff of students has given it their all and have done an outstanding job. 
It is this staff of 250 students that is the backbone of The Observer and it is to them that the greatest debt is owed. They are the true unsung heros of this organization. 
These are the people who have spent countless hours working at the paper, many of them over 40 hours a week. They have sacrificed their time and sometimes their grades. They do not work for money or glory but rather to serve the students, and hopefully they have a little fun and learn a lot along the way. 
An editor of The Observer many years ago used to answer the common college qtJes­tion, "What's your major?" with "The Observer." Many of the staff could easily say the same thing today. They have spent more of their college careers working here than in their own majors. It is this dedica­tion that keeps the paper going and without it. the organization would certainly deterio­rate and collapse. 
So, I'd like to thank the staff, especially the outgoing seniors, and I'd like to thank our readers. 
Leaving the company you have worked at for four years is a bittersweet experience. Like leaving college you look forward to something new, but you regret leaving something that has bnen such a part of your life and that you have come to love. 
The late Malcolm Forbes once said, "In life, the only constant is change." I look forward to what the future holds, and I have every confidence that the next staff will do an outstanding job. I wish them luck. 
And finally, I'd like to thank all those who have supported me and put up with me throughout my tenure at The Observer: my mother and sister, my grandparents, my roommates past and present, my dear friends, my understanding teachers, the 'Bune, The Papers, Shirley, and Christine. I couldn't have done it without you. [301

The plan outlines no major federal programs not already called for in the president's budget request. 
Its overall goal is to maintain the U.S. transportation system as "the finest in the world." However, the report said "there are increasing signs ... that the system is beginning to break down." 
Sen. James Exon. D-Neb .. chairman of the Senate surface transportation subcommittee, said, ''I'm going to be looking through this to sec whether or not this simply doesn't transfer the problems we have ... off the backs of the federal govern­ment and onto the backs of state and local governments." 
Hep. John Paul Hammer­schmidt of Arkansas, top He­publican on a House trans­portation subcommittee, said, "I think the money has to come from users, one way or an­other, and because it is a na­tional plan, the logical way for it to come from users is through a national tax sys­tem."

Moslems·in Kashmir fight curfew 
SHINAGAH, India (AP) ­Thousands of Moslems confined to mosques and homes by a curfew vowed Thursday to die for Kashmir's independence, shouting their slogans at top Indian politicians who arrived to assess the situation. 
Before the curfew was im­posed at 10 a.m. Moslem mili­tants and security forces fought prolonged gunbattles, and at least two people were killed and 10 injured, witnesses said. 
Islamic and pro-independence slogans, broadcast continu­ously by mosque loudspeakers, reverberated through this city of 1 million people as the politi­cians drove from the airport to their hotel. 
The 14 leaders, belonging to major political parties. traveled the 9-mile route in a convoy of 40 cars escorted by paramili­tary troops in trucks mounted with machine guns. 
"The slogan of the faith, Al­lah is great!" thousands shouted from within the mosques as the convoy drove past at noon. 
"We want independence!" they also chanted. 
The politicians, including former Prime Minister Hajiv Gandhi and Deputy Prime Min­ister Devi Lal, were refused permission to leave their heavily guarded hotel. 
Security forces strictly en­forced the curfew, but the broadcasts continued. Many speeches urged Moslems to sacrifice their lives for Kash­mir's independence. 
At least 173 people have been killed since Jan. 20 when the government launched a crack­down on Moslem militants who demand secession of the pre­dominantly Moslem Jammu­Kashmir state from mostly Hindu India. 
"I am shocked. If there is no political solution I see some very hard options ahead," Gandhi said at the luxury Cen­taur Hotel on the edge of Dal Lake. "I do not want to define 
them." 
Disenchantm~~lt with. the_?OV­crnment was mcredble, he said, while at least 1,000 com­mandos and paramilitary police patrolled the lake and gardens surrounding the hotel. 
Gandhi said state Gov. Jag­mohan refused to permit the delegation to visit residents of Srinagar, Jammu-Kashmir's largest city and tlHl etmter of the secessionist campaign. 
Jagmohan took charge as the state's governor Jan. 18 and ordered the crackdown. 
He said allowing Gandhi and the other leaders to go out 
would  have  created  a  
"tremendous security risk."  
Jagmohan  later  allowed  a  

delegation of about 40 resi­dents to meet Gandhi at his ho­tel, a police official said. 
Jagmohan said the curfew will be relaxed Friday after the politicians leave Srinagar. 
W. German fire probably caused by arson 
FHANKFUHT, West Germany (AP) -Arson was the likely cause of a fire that swept through a downtown restau­rant and killed 11 people, in­cluding four Americans.. police said Thursday. 
Police first suspected that a gas leak in the kitchen may have caused the Wednesday night fire that gutted Koryo, a Chinese-Korean restaurant near Frankfurt's cathedral and the Zeit shopping district. 
"Evidence now points more to arson," said police spokesman Manfred Fuellhardt after inves­tigators searched the gutted restaurant. 
IIe said the lire broke out in a storage room, under the wooden stairs leading to the restaurant on the second floor of the live-story building. 
Smoke quickly filled the restaurant and some guests were injured when they jumped from windows to escape the flames, Fuellhardt said. He said the fire exit apparently was blocked. 
Fuellhardt said the victims suffocated. Seven people were injured, live of them seriously, police said. 
The dead included an Ameri­can couple, both age 33. Fuell­hardt said. 
Another police official, Franz Winkler, said two children, in­cluding the couple's 1 1/2-year­old son, also died. The other child was an American girl of about 12 or 13, he said. 
Winkler said it was still not dear if the girl was the child of the couple, a relative or a friend out with them for the evening. 
Two of the couple's otlwr children, a 4-year-old boy and a 6-year-old girl, suffered serious injuries, Winkler said. 
At least three of' the dead were connected with U.S. forces statiorwd in West <lnrmany, said U.S. Army spokeswoman Brigitte Schmitz. She declined to release their identities until relatives could be told.

Ten minority students from the University of Notre Dame will spend their spring semester break observing thn Community of Caring program in five American cities March 10-18. 
The program. a project of the Joseph P. Kennedy Foundation, provides high-school curricula and discussion models which address a variety of social problems afflicting American adolescents. including teen pregnancy, drug and alcohol abuse, truancy, vandalism, and violence. 
According to Foundation lit­erature, the program promotes "the universally accepted ethical values of caring, responsibility, trust, respect for self, others and family" and fosters a

Gilliam's testimony is ex­pected in late April. 
Lantos said the court-ap­pointed speeial proseeutor, Ar­lin Adams, who is investigating Pierce and other former HUD officials, said immunity for Gilliam would not conflict with his investigation. 
Lantos defended his panel's continuing investigation after the appointment of the special prosecutor. lie said Adams' probe is limited to activities in­volving HUD's moderate reha­bilitation program that pro­vided renovation subsidies for

low-income rental housing, and his panel was looking into other areas. 
Pierce has refused to testify before Lantos' House Govern­ment Operations subeommittee on employment and housing. 
Several former Pierce aides have also refused to testify, cit­ing their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimina­tion. Among them was Deborah Dean, Pierce's former top aide. 
A HUD source, speaking only on eondition of anonymity, de­scribed the move with Gilliam as a breakthrough be<:ause he "knows everything." 
Pierce has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and accuses the subeommittee of targeting him despite evidence to support his position. 
Lantos said Gilliam was re­ceiving no indueement, such as a reduction in sentence, to testify.

All Irish eyes won't be smiling on St. Pat's Day 
By Mary Ann Hennessey

word of paid informants. Soaring unemployment and forced ghetto living under seign-like conditions for a na­tion's indigenous pnople. Is this a picture of South Africa, El Salvador, Cambodia. Israel? No this is daily Irish life in the British occupied north east cornnr of Ireland. 
Imagine, too, a national holi­day to commemorate the an­niversary of a massacre of na­tive people by an invading and still occupying force; something akin to a U.S. holiday celebrat­ing the Trail of Tears, or the arrival of the first slave ships. It sounds horrendous but this actually occurs annually, re­plete with parades and other festivities in the British occu­pied northeast corner of Ireland. 
I don't have the time, space or self control to give an ac­count of the history of British crimes against the Irish during 800 years of persecution and oppression, nor even to point out the extent to which these crimes continue to go unan­swered today. However, what has to be said is that the home of the "Fighting Irish" should be ashamed of its apathy, si­lence. and abandonment of the very source of its inspiration. When we wave our green and gold nags proudly at sporting events, do we not know that .men and women have died for 
this act, that in Ireland it has 
been considered subversive to 
display the tricolor, and still is 
in the northeast part today?

more people of Irish ancestry that the whole of the island of Ireland. but it appears that we recall this fact only annually on March 17. We watch parades with crowds of green clad, beer drinking, jig dancing Americans proudly exclaiming Irish slo­gans and putting on a fake brogue. We eat corned beef and cabbage and pretend that we like it; do we again forget that this meal is a reminder of the poverty suffered by the immi­grants in the "Little Dublins," and Irishtowns all across this country? 
In Ireland, St. Patrick's day is more likely to be spent in church than in celebrating. The Irish are more likely to be praying for an end to the "Troubles" and peace in their land than revelling in the streets and pubs. Individually at least 70% of the Irish catholics in Belfast and Derry likely pray for a job, or that they will not have their house ransacked in a search that day, or that they will not be ar­rested, strip searched, beaten and held in prison for the al­lowed 7 days without charge. Everyone knows that the prac­tice of "internment" has been ended, however with very little trouble the detention period of seven days without charge may be extended indefinitely, with the right to see a lawyer being suspended. Just this year the right to silence, long considered fundamental in this country, has been dismissed and now even one's refusal to speak in such conditions may be con­strued as an admission of guilt. 

The descriptions of the su­pergrass trials and the ac­counts of friends who have often been arrested and charged with phony crimes, the most popular of which seems to be the nebulous "conspiracy" charge, remind me of the fa­mous trial of Danton, a French statesman, during the French revolution. In response to his accusor's charge that he con­spired against the government for the overthrow of the regime, he said, "Yes, I con­spired, alone, within the con­fines of my heart, with myself, I conspired." For this he was guillotined, for this men and women and children suffer con­stant fear of arrest, imprison­ment, humiliation and torture. All this for desiring an end to foreign occupation of their land. 
The United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Peoples in its preamble states that "we live in a time of great hopes and deep despair ... a time when liberation struggles have succeeded in arousing the peo­ples of the world against the domestic and international structures of imperialism and in overturning colonial sys­tems." In response to the ef­forts of the peoples of the world to end the reign of impe­rialism and to stem the emer­gence of neo-colonialism, this Declaration serves to enumer­ate the fundamental rights of peoples and to enjoin the inter­national community to uphold them. 
The United States and Notre Dame have vociferously de­nounced human rights abuses in many parts of the world, and at the same time chosen to ig­nore others. I admit that I am ignorant of the criteria being used to judge the "worthiness" of the suffering endured by millions if not billions of people on this planet. Are we so in­debted to "Great" Britain for the persecution of religious aberrants which allowed for the foundation of our nation, and, consequently our univer­sity, that we must consistently turn a blind eye to the injustices she commits? Must we remain silent even when it is our own homeland, for some, and the source of our identity for all of us at the Irish Catholic institu­tion of Notre Dame? 
The final article of the United Nations Universal Declaration of the Rights of Peoples states, "the reestablishment of funda­mental rights of peoples, when they are seriously disregarded, is a duty incumbent upon all members of the international community." This is why we stand up and say enough Apartheid in South Africa, enough abuse of Palestinians in the occupied territories of Israel, enough disregard for the homeless in the U.S., and enough discrimination and op­pression in Northern Ireland, indeed the "State" of Northern Ireland has existed too long, enough to a divided Ireland. We must explore all nonviolent means to correct injustice wherever we find it. In Ireland that means supporting the MacBride Principles and putting diplomatic pressure on the "British Empire." Great Britain must be made aware that the golden age of her em­pire is gone, she must learn 
GARRY TRUDEAU 
that she has innicted enough pain upon the peoples of the world and now it is time to learn to live within her borders and accept the right of the Irish (Scotch and Welsh) not to be English. 
Any future peaceful and united Ireland must come from within Ireland, however the only hope that this can come about swiftly and without any more bloodshed is through an international recognition that the present situation is unac­ceptable. Of course, all people have the right to self-determi­nation of the social, political and economic order under which they will live, and in the present day, the statelet of Northern Ireland contains a majority in favor of continued annexation to the U.K. 
However, what must be un­derstood is that this is not the fundamental question at hand. The very existence of the so­called state of Northern Ireland is based upon a false premise. The partition of Ireland can only be seen as gerrymandering and machinations of a colonial power faced with a general and violent dissatisfaction with its rule. The very creation of two Irelands was and remains wrong and indefensible. The question of self-determination can only, then, be valid when considered by the island as a whole. 
For myself, this is not a situ­ation dealing solely in lofty, quixotic ideals, it is, rather, one which touches me directly and deeply. St. Patrick's day is an opportunity for us all, as a na­tion built upon immigration, to honor and celebrate our Irish heritage, and yet it should be an occasion for us to think, are Irish eyes really smiling today? 
Mary Ann Hennessey is a se­nior government and French major.

Sabres annihilate Bruins in Adams Division showdown ­
BOSTON (AP) -Alexander Mogilny and Dave Snuggerud scored two goals each as the Buffalo Sabres won the battle of the NHL's fwo top teams with a 10-4 rout of the Boston Bruins Thursday night. 
Boston began the day atop the NIIL and Adams Division standings with 89 points and a chance to deal a severe blow to the Sabres' hopes of catching up. Buffalo, second in the league and the division, ended the night with 84 points. 
The Bruins, who allowed a league-low 191 goals going into the game, tied a team record for most goals allowed in a home game. It was the seventh time they gave up 10 and the lirst since Dec. 8, 1966. 
The Sabres. 2-0-2 in their last four games, were aggressive from the start. outshooting Boston 21-12 in the first pe­riod. Goalies Andy Moog and Heggie Lemelin took turns get­ting beat behind a porous de­frmse. 
Boston, which had won its last four games and eight of nine, played its second straight game without all-star defense­man Ray Bourque, who has a strained abdominal muscle. 
The Sabres led 4-0 after one period on two goals by Mogilny and one each by Dave Andreychuk and Darrin Shannon, his first in the NHL. They built the lead to 7-0 at I 0:10 of the second period on goals by Phil Housley, Pierre Turgeon and Snuggerud. 
The Bruins finally scored against goalie Daren Puppa on Cam Neely's 48th goal of the season at 11:55 and Peter 
. Douris' third at 12:26. But the Sabres got those back when Snuggnrud scored his 13th at 
15:19 and Rick Vaive got his 26th on a power play at 18:41 of the second period. 
Boston's Craig Janney added a third-period power play goal and Mike Hartman made the score 10-3 at 17:19 before Neely got his 49th goal 17 sec­onds later. 

Moog stopped nine shots be­fore leaving the game at 11:27 of the first period after Mogilny's second goal and 13th of the season made the score 3­
0. Mogilny skated around de­fenseman Stephane Quintal and beat Moog, who had skated 30 feet out of the net to stop the breakaway. 
Lemelin took over and made 11 saves before Snuggerud's 12th goal of the season made it 7-0 at 10:10 of the second pe­riod and brought Moog back into the game. Lemelin made a pad save on Uwe Krupp's shot 
on  a  two-on-one  attack,  but  
Snugerud fired home the  re­ 
bound.  

Red Wings 3, Blues 2 
DETROIT (AP) Steve Yzerman tied for the NHL lead with his sixth short-handed goal as the Detroit Red Wings beat St. Louis 3-2 Thursday night for only their second vic­tory in seven games against the Blues. 
The Red Wings, who have won four of their last five games, moved back into fourth place in the Norris Division, one point ahead of idle Minnesota in the race for the final playoff spot. Detroit is 2­4-1 against St. Louis. 
The Blues remained in first place in the division, two points ahead of the idle Chicago Blackhawks, with whom they play a home-and-home series Saturday in St. Louis and Sunday in Chicago. 
Yzerman's 55th goal at 9:28 of the second period tied the score 1-1. It tied Yzerman with Edmonton's Craig MacTavish for the NHL lead in short­handed goals . 
Gerard Gallant put the Red Wings ahead 2-1 on a power­play goal, his 34th, at 16:50 of the second period. Gallant beat Vincent Riendeau with a slap shot from the right circle while Gino Cavallini was off for high­sticking Mike O'Connell. 
Jimmy Carson gave the Red Wings a 3-1 lead with his 20th goal on a power play at 2:59 of the third period, four seconds after Mike Lalor was sent off for holding Marc Habscheid. 
Brett Hull, the NHL's leading scorer, gave St. Louis a 1-0 lead with an unassisted goal, his 65th, at 9:04 of the first pe­riod. Hull took a wayward pass from Detroit's Steve Chiasson and flipped the puck easily into the net over a sprawling Tim Cheveldae on just the second shot of the game for the Blues. 
Paul MacLean cut the lead to 3-2 with his 27th goal, also unassisted, after taking a bouncing puck off defender Lee Norwood's skate at 14:28 of the third period. 
Riendeau, who was pulled twice for a total of 14 seconds for an extra attacker in the fi­nal minute, turned away 28 of 31 shots. He made a brilliant save at 3:28 of the second pe­riod. 
In other NHL action last night, the New York Rangers beat the Philadelphia Flyers 7-5 and the Toronto Maple Leafs sunk the Hartford Whalers 7-6.

IU beats Ohio St., loses Anderson 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) ­Freshman Calbert Cheaney scored 22 points Thursday night as Indiana, playing the second half without its injured leading scorer, beat Ohio State 77-66 and kept alive its hopes for an NCAA tournament bid. 
The Hoosiers (18-9 and 8-9 in the Big Ten) lost sophomore forward Eric Anderson, who crashed to the floor with a minute left in the first half and was taken to Bloomington Hospital with a bad sprain of his right ankle. 
Indiana trailed 29-25 at the half, but freshman Matt Nover and sophomore Jamal Meeks picked up the slack and finished with earner highs of 16 points apiece. 
Indiana had a 30-3 advantage in free throws and scored 10 of its final 12 points from the free throw line as the Buckeyes (15­12 and 9-8) fouled repeatedly in the dosing minutes. 
Two free throws apiece by Cheaney and Meeks, a 3-point goal by Cheaney and a steal and fast-break layup by Meeks erasod a 7-point Ohio State lead midway through the sec­ond half. The Buckeyes twice again managPd leads of one point but baskets by Nover and Meeks and another 3-pointer by Cheaney put the lloosiers on top for good. 
Freshman Pat (;raham added 
1:l points for the Hoosiers. Anderson, who had averaged 
16.8 for the season, had only OIHJ point before the injury as hH fought for a rebound. 
Ohio State was led by Perry Carter with 16 points and Big Ten freshman of the year Jim Jackson with 12. 
The victory still left Indiana in seventh place in the confer­ence, a game bPhind the sixth­place Buckeyes with one game remaining. Both teams are hoping for bids to the NCAA tourney. 
The Hoosiers held Jackson, Ohio State's leading scorer, to 


five points in the first half. But 
a 3-point barrage by the 
Buckeyes kept them ahead most 
of the period. 

Chris Jent's first 3-pointer was Ohio State's only basket during a 12-3 Indiana spurt that gave the Hoosiers their biggest lead of the opening pe­riod at 12-9. Jent, who came into the game hitting only 38 percent of his 3-point attempts. then hit two in a row to put the Buckeyes back in front midway through the half. 
A leaning, off-balance 2­pointer by Jent and a 3-point basket by Jackson gave Ohio State a seven-point lead two minutes later, and the Buckeyes matched that when a 3-pointer by Alex Davis put them ahead 23-16 with six minutes to go. 
Graham hit a 3-pointer that started a 9-2 spurt, and Graham's two free throws tied the game 25-25 before baskets by Jackson and Davis put Ohio State on top 29-25 at the in­termission.

The Observer 
Tennis squad puts ranking on the line at Texas Invite 
BY BOB MITCHELL 
Sports Writer 
Life is full of simple plea­sures. Some come unexpectedly, others are years in the making. For Notre Dame skipper Bob Bayliss, who is now in his third campaign, national recognition has been one of his biggest aspirations. 
Bayliss's wish has finally come true. According to the latest ITCA collegiate tennis poll, Notre Dame is the 22nd best team in collegiate tennis. 
OK. so 22nd isn't the best ranking in the world, but con­sidering how far the tennis program has come in such a short time, one has to shake his head in disbelief. Bayliss inher­ited a solid program from le­gendary coach Tom Fallon, yet he improved and introduced fresh blood into a good pro­gram. 
Bayliss took the climb to na­tional prominence one step at a time. llis philosophy has cre­ated a program whose fortunes can only improve. And this strategy has produced Notre Dame's first nationally ranked team in 15 years. Yet, Bayliss characteristically downplays tlw significance of the monu­mental accomplishment. 
"Teams have a tendency to bask in the glory of the pre­sent," explained Bayliss. "We don't want that to happen. I told the team that you are as good as your last match. We have to let rankings and those type of things take care of themselves. The most impor­tant thing to do is to improve in practice and play the best match that you can."

Valvano has been under pres­sure from some quarters to re­sign since former player Charles Shackleford admitted receiving $65,000 while playing for the Wolfpack. The State Bureau of Investigation is still investigating the point-shaving allegations. 
Negotiations between Valvano's attorney Art Kaminsky and N.C. State Counsel Becky French bogged down last week while rumors flew over how much money Valvano might be offered to step down. 
Both Manning and Chief Deputy Attorney General Andy Vanore were to meet in execu­tive session Friday with the University of North Carolina System's Board of Governors, said John Simmons, a spokesman for the attorney general's office. He said the board would have a say in the final decision.

Zorich, Watters, Lyght, Heldt ar.e named captains 
Special to The Observer 
Four seniors-center Mike Heldt, cornerback Todd Lyght, tailback Ricky Watters and nose tackle Chris Zorich-have been elected captains of the 1990 Notre Dame football team by their teammates. 
This marks only the second time in Irish history that four players have served as captains in one season; Tony Furjanic, Mike Larkin, Allen Pinkett and Tim Scannell held those roles in 1985. 
Heldt, a 6-foot-4, 265­pounder from Tampa, Fla., has started 25 straight games for Notre Dame at center over the past two seasons. He earned honorable mention All-America honors in 1989 from The Sporting News and Football News and has been a key figure in Notre Dame's successful running game the past two sea­sons. Heldt is not expected to participate in spring practice this year after dislocating his elbow in the 1990 Orange Bowl win over Colorado. 
Lyght, a 6-foot-1, 181­pounder from Flint, Mich., has started in 24 straight games at cornerback over the past two years. He earned unanimous All-America honors as a junior in 1989, was one of three final­ists for the Jim Thorpe Award presented to the top defensive back in the country and totaled eight interceptions. Lyght was just two interceptions short of the all-time Notre Dame single­season record. 
Watters, a 6-foot-2, 199­pounder from Harrisburg, Pa., ranks as Notre Dame's top re­turning ground gainer for 1990 after rushing for 791 yards on 118 carries last season. He earned honorable mention All­America honors in 1989 from The Sporting News and Football News. Watters led the 
Irish in receiving in 1988 (15 catches for 286 yards) while starting at flanker, and he boasts a career punt-return av­erage of 13.3 yards, including three returns for touchdowns. 
Zorich, a 6-foot-1, 268­pounder from Chicago, has started 25 games over the past two seasons at nose tackle. He was a consensus All-American in 1989, also earning recogni­tion as the United Press International lineman of the year and as one of four finalists for the Lombardi Award. 
The Irish are slated to begin spring practice on March 23.

"The ranking doesn't matter," says freshman Chuck Coleman. "The only thing that matters are the rankings at the end of the season. We have to keep playing as hard as we have been all season long. As long as we do that we will be fine." 
For the Notre Dame men's tennis team, life could not sim­ply be better now that it has a national ranking and will spend spring break in Austin, Texas to continue their national schedule. The Irish will enjoy the great state of Texas and play nationally-competitive teams. 
The Irish will face a perennial southern power Furman on March 16. They could conceiv­ably play the No. 12 collegiate team, Alabama if they get by the South Carolina school. And if things go well against the Crimson Tide, Notre .Dame would most probably face Texas University. 

The Observer/John Cluver The Notre Dame tennis team gained recognition when it was ranked 22nd in the nation by the lTC A this past week. 
N.C. State looks for solution to new Valvano controversy 
"We are playing the best teams that we could schedule," said Bayliss. 'The competition should be great and Austin is a neat place to be.We can get some work in and be prepared to play on Friday. Regarding Furman, they are good Southern team and we cannot afford to look past them." 
Notes: In the latest ITCA sin­gles poll, Notre Dame's No. 1 player Dave DiLucia moved up to No. 29 in the singles rank­ings from the No. 44 slot. The rankings do not include Dil.ucia's results in the H.E.B. Collegiate Tennis Championships. 


RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -The Jim Valvano contract quandary at North Carolina State took a new direction Thursday -be­hind closed doors. 
The attorney general's office has agreed to handle future ne­gotiations for the state regard­ing the basketball coach's fu­ture with the Wolfpack. And a Raleigh attorney, Howard Manning, will represent the school's interests. 
Negotiators hope that keep­ing a new series of discussions private will help all sides reach a quicker solution to the prickly question of what to do with Valvano.

Of course. the Illinois matter wasn't the first bit of adversity l~llis has had to eneounter this school year. Midway through the fall st~rnesLPr. he learned that his grad!' point average did not nwl'l University stan­dards to bP Pligibln for that senwstt~r. Whiln Notre Dame stumblmt to a 1-3 start. Iillis was forc!'d to watch from the sidl'liiWS. 
In soml' ways, tlw Irish still are making up lost ground aft!'r Ellis' absent~!' from tlw season's first SI'VPn ganws. 
"Aftnr lw got bad, we had to get in a rhythm," Phelps said. "It has nothing to do with wins and losst~s. It has PVPrything to do with playing togPllwr and getting usPd to each other. That rhythm rwver really sur­facPd until WI' got to Syracuse." 
The loss of Pligibility was not all that had Ellis distraught. 
"I nevPr lward it directly. but it was kind of degrading to find OUt a lot of pPrsons had Josl confidt~nce and thought I wouldn't be abln to return and play ball at Notn~ Dame thP second senwstl'r." Ellis said. "I thought that was intPresting because I havP a grPat ara­demie background. It was in­lnrnsling to sPn pnople lose faith in mn." 
Ellis' honwtown of East St. Louis gerwrally is known only for its depressed economy and outstanding high school sports teams. But Ellis loved being raismJ in a city many pnopiP mention with disdain. 
"If I could grow up all over again. I'd want to grow up there," he said. "It tells you a lot in terms of how to livn. You learn to apprneiate things in life more." 
It also gave Ellis a ehance to hone his basketball skills with one of the best scholastic pro­grams in the nation. Ellis led East St. Louis Lincoln lligh to back-to-back state titlns and faced off with players like Georgetown's Alonzo Mourning, Illinois' Marcus Liberty and Indiana's Eric Anderson. 
After a senior season in which he placed fourth in the Parade magazine national Player of the Year ballotinA (behind Mourning, Syracuse's Billy Owens and Georgia Tech's Kenny Anderson), Ellis was bound for Notre Dame to play for Phelps and Shumate, one of the best big-man coaches in the country. 
But the summer before Ellis 

was to arrive at Notre Dame. 

ShumatP left South Bend to 
tak1~ the head coaching position 
at Soutlwrn Methodist. 
"I thought about 
(transferring) after he lnf'l bn­
eause lw was a very key factor 
in my decision to come hen~." 
Ellis said. "I was very dn­
pn1ssed for a long time." 
To the delight of Notrn Dame 
fans, Ellis decided to go ahead 
and play for the Irish after all. 
lie averaged 13.5 points and a 
team-high 9.4 rebounds per 
game, and his 53 blocked shots 
set a new single-season school 
record. 
Despite missing the first part of this season, Ellis has shown major improvements as a sophomore. lie scores 14.5 points per game, just behind Keith Hobinson's team-leading 
14.6 average, and has an as­tounding 12.6 rebounds per game. 

Ellis is on pacn to bneome the first Irish player since Toby Knight in 1976-77 to average double figures in n~bounds. In Notrn Dame's 66-65 upset of Syracuse last month. Ellis outrebounded the Orange's Derrick Coleman, !HlP of thP all­limn NCAA rebounding leaders. 
''I've always wantPd to aver­age 20 points per gamn, but we have a lot of players the points should be distributnd between," Ellis said, "but I look around and see what I can do on re­bounds, and I know I can go well out of the range of any­body on the team with rebound­ing." 
It figures that Ellis is having such success with rebounding this year. He's had to do enough rebounding from off­court distractions that it must be getting natural for him.

O'Connor will run in NCAA meet 
By DAVE DIETEMAN 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's in­door track team will bring its 1990 season to a close this weekend. when senior distance specialist Mike O'Connor travels to the NCAA Indoor Track championships at Indianapolis. 
"We've had some good per­formances this season," noted Notre Dame assistant coach Tim Connelly. "The Central Collegiate Conference meet was a good meet for us; we took fifth place there. But the IC4As were a bit of a disappointment; we finished ninth in a field of 90, but we wanted to finish in the top live." 
Mike O'Connor. also a stand­out cross-country runner for the Irish. qualified for the NCAA Championships in both the 3000 and 5000 meter races. He qualified for the 5000 early in the season, as he posted a time of 13:57.38 at the Alex Wilson Invitational at the Loftus Sports Center on February 24. Last weekend, at the IC4A meet, which was held at Harvard University, O'Connor qualified for the 3000 meter run by winning the event with a time of 7:59.19. 

Yet O'Connor will only com­pete in the 5000 meter run, 

which will be run outdoors. 
Because this race will be run 
outdoors, O'Connor ca·n qualify 
for the NCAA outdoor champi­
onships, provided that his time 
is up to par. "If Mike runs well 
here, his chances for qualifying 
for the outdoor championships 
improve measurably," ex­
plained Connelly. 
Aside from such future con­cerns, the 5000 has con­sistently proven to be a better event for O'Connor. Additionally, O'Connor, who is one of nine individuals to qualify for the 5000 meter run, is one of only ·four American runners that have earned the right to run the 5000 at the championship meet. 
"I think that Mike can do very well. He's shown over the last few weeks that if he can get into the race, he can hang tough and kick with anyone in the nation," concluded Connelly.

the Blue Demons in scoring with 16.7 points per game. The Irish held Booth to nine points on 3-of-8 shooting in the first meeting between the two teams. 
Howard is the only other Blue Demon in double figures with 
14.5 ppg and 8.4 rebounds, while freshman guard Terry Davis scores 9.9 ppg. 
The Irish will probably stick with the same starters they have used in the past two victo­ries -sophomore Elmer Bennett (1 0. 7 ppg) and junior Kevin Ellery ( 4.2 ppg) at th';' guard spots, senior Keith Robinson (14.6 ppg and 7.9 rpg) in the middle and sophomores Daimon Sweet (6.3 ppg) and LaPhonso Ellis (14.5 ppg and 12.6 rpg) at forwards. 

Senior co-captain Joe Fredrick has been steady off the bench in the past two 
games for Notre Dame, scoring 8 points against Missouri and a 
season-high  23  versus  
Kentucky.  
   

The Irish will learn Sunday evening if and where they will play in the NCAA Tournament. The tourney begins next Thursday and Friday at eight sites from Hartford, Conn., to Long Beach, Calif. 
Two things in Notre Dame's favor are its power rating and strength of schedule. The Irish are ranked 36th in the Sagarin power ratings and improved to 34th in the latest Associated Press poll. 
Notre Dame's schedule is listed 32nd in the country. Of the 31 teams with a stronger schedule, 10 have losing records, 15 are rated lower than Notre Dame in the power rankings, and one -North Carolina State -is on probation and ineligible for the tourney. 
Purdue has the toughest schedule in the country accord­ing to the rankings followed by Pittsburgh, Ohio State, Northwestern and Iowa.

Singleton adjusts to role as reserve in Irish resurgence 
By CHRIS COONEY Sports Writer 
The rollerroaster ride of the Notre Dame basketball team this year has had a dizzying effect on Tim Singleton. 
For the junior, this season has meant relinquishing his role as floor conductor to be­come a passenger on a trip that has. at times. seemed wildly out-of-control. As he alternated between starting at point guard and spending time on the bench as a reserve, Singleton has had to sit back and watch as other people, narm~ly Elmer Bennett. took over on center stage. 
While some people might bP indignant or upset aftnr losing their starting job. for SingiPton. individual stardom can wait as long as the Irish win. 
"W11 needed more scoring. It was a decision Coach had to make," says Singleton, refer­ring to the fourte11n games this season in which h1~ was re­placed by Bt~nnett at a position he held for all of last year. "I still play the same game when I'm in and the team is on a run now." 
The Irish upset Missouri last weekend and beat Kentucky on Monday night, reviving their hopes of receiving an NCAA bid. In the Missouri game, Singleton was one of a gang of Notre Dame players who came off the bench and contributed substan­tially to the Irish victory. Singleton scored nine points while dishing out eight assists. 
The assists added to Singleton's team-leading season total of 128. Setting up others to score is Singleton's forte, but it has led to some problems this year as head coach Digger Phelps has encouraged him to try and take the ball to the basket a little more often. 
"I've got to get into the habit of scoring more,"says 
Road 
continued from page 16 
Irish are only hitting .215 thus 
far and have scored just 26 
runs in their seven games. 
"The mistakes we're making 

are not because it's early in the 
season," commented Murphy. 
"Wt~'re not being aggressive 
and we're being too seleetive." 
It's only a matter of time. 

though, before the Irish hitters 
get in stride. Craig Counsell 
(.188). Ed l.und (.111), and Joe 
Binkinwicz (.050) havn shown in 
the past that they are quality 
hitters and will need to get in 
the groove for thn Irish to 
eontinue winning. 
The Irish pitching staff again 

will be the key for this trip. In 
this weekend's games Murphy 
will use Brian Piotrowiez, Pat 
Leahy, and either Chad 
llartvigson or Joe Binkiewiez 
as starters. The same four 
players will handle starting 
roles the following weekend.

Singleton, who sees himself as the tempo-setter and primary playmaker offensively. "I drive a lot and guys pull on me so I pass it off." 
On Saturday. however, Singleton got the opportunity to showcase his scoring talents. During a five minute Notre Dame run, Singleton ran the of­fense like the Irish were giving an exhibition entitled "llow to Play Run-and-Gun Basketball." llis contributions included three steals which resulted in two dunks, one of them behind the back, and an alley-oop pass to Monty Williams. 
"That was one of my best games," remembers Singleton, who is averaging 4. 7 points per game. "I felt like I controlled the tempo of the game and when I had the ball man-to­man. I could go to the basket and dunk." 
Singleton plans to display his shooting skills even more next year, in addition to providing Notre Dame with some senior leadership, a factor he feels the lrish were unfortunately with­out this season. 
"We had a chance of beating every team this year." says Singleton,"but we had some bad experiences with people only playing one good half and then getting complacent. We needed people showing leader­ship so we would put two good halves together. 
"Guys would get complacent which lets the other team back into it. When we had letdowns. no one stepped in and took charge." 
That has all changed now for Notre Dame, claims Singleton. The entire team finally got fed up with losing, he says, inspir­ing the performance that has the Irish riding high on a two-game winning streak and hop­ing to clinch an NCAA tourney berth this Saturday by beating DePaul. 
"We're keeping everything in perspective and not letting our­selves get lackadaisical," says Singleton of the change. "We know what it feels like to lose and we got tired of it-that's the whole thing right there." 

Adding to Singleton's talents are his defensive skills. Leading the team in steals with 28, Singleton's style of play has led his teammates to dub him "Mouse." 
"Jamere Jackson started calling me that. I guess because I'm so much shorter than ev­eryone else and just run around most of the time trying to bother people," says Singleton, who at 6-1 is ten inches shorter than Notre Dame's tallest player. Keith Tower. "My job is to stop the other team's guards and create trouble for them." 
Through all the ups and downs of the season, Singleton says biggest fan remains, with­out a doubt, his mother. 
"I carne to Notre Dame be­cause my mom really liked it." says Singleton. a native of New Orleans. "She liked the tradi­tion and the fact that I'll get a good degree here. 
"Plus, since we're on TV a lot, my family can watch and I can keep my mom proud." 
Singleton's other inspiration comes from a less typical source. The Morrissey Manor resident spends time before each game relaxing while listening to rap music. 
"I like the way it's so crazy, making all the words rhyme and keeping the beat at the same time," says Singleton, whose favorite rappers include Public Enemy and the Boogie Down Production (the BDPs). "I listen to it before I walk over to the arena." 
The rhythm remains once the game begins. Singleton enters the game and sets the tempo. Under his guidance, hopefully, Notre Dame will continue its winning ways as the current Irish beat goes on.
