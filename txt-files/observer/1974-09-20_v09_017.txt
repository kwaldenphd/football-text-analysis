On-campus retail outlet suggested for food co-op 
by Matt Yokom 
Staff Reporter 

Direct distribution of wholesale food from a permanent on-campus retail outlet was the recommendation of a Student Gi>vernment report. The report was sent yesterday to several Student Affairs members and representatives of the Notre Dame Alumni Association and Faculty Senate. 
The report, signed by Student Body President Pat McLaughlin and Off-Campus Com­missioners Paul McEvily and Stan Cardenas, listed four other alternatives and why they are not feasible. 
Over-the-counter buying at wholesale outlets was found unacceptable because they sell in bulk and are "built to deliver food, not to expose it to browsing customers," the report stated. Distribution from wholesalers to individuals by truck or to neighborhood pick-up points runs into legal difficulties. The alternative of distribution 
to a temporary on-campus pick-up point was also rejected for legal reasons and also because of the limitation of days and hours for pick-up. 
The report found that in the direct distribution at a permanent on-campus retail outlet, "We 

may be assuming a high initial cost, but it remains as the only alternative." It could be stocked andnopen all the time, and fill individual orders at wholesale prices.· The on-campus location would allow adequate attention to meeting all legal and health requirements." 
The report ended by stressing that a 
cooperative distribution "would benefit the total 
Notre Dame community, not just the students." 
Br. Just Paczesny, Vice President of Student 
Affairs, stated "Other options should be con­
sidered while not closing the door on any form of 
assistance." He asked if this distribution centers 
necessarily has to be on campus. 
Fr. Thomas Tallarida, Director of Off-campus 
Students, believed that a cooperative was a fine 
idea but it will take time, perhaps two years. 
Tallarida said that much time needs to be 
taken in the investigation of many of the dif­
ferent angles. Among the problems are finding 
the primary capital, laws concerning 
cooperatives in Indiana, and refrigeration costs. 
Tallarida said, "We shouldn't kill the idea of 
other options while working for a co-op. In the 
meantime, let's do something to help off-campus 
students now." 
The report stated, however, that 

Local police begin cracking down on underage drinking 
by Bill Gonzenbach and Ellen Syburg Staff Reporters 

South Bend police are cracking down on underage drinking in area bars, as evidenced by last Wednesday night's raid on Louie's Restaurant in which nine Notre Dame and two St. Mary's students were arrested. 
Anew vice squad has been formed and the use of alcohol is one of its primary concerns, according to Dean of Students John Macheca who had been warned of .the development by City Safety Director Patrick Gallagher prior to the raid. 
City Councilman Roger Parent stated that the increased en­formcement of liquor laws "has probably resulted from the slight increase in complaints from residents of neighborhoods near the taverns." 
Local bar owners also expressed awareness of the police department's intent to strictly enforce liquor laws. "The police told us that they would be around, checking up on us for liquor violations," explained Joe Mell, manager of Corby's Bar. "They warned us to stay within the law," agreed Rick Kanser, owner of the Library. 
Parent has evidenced concern over the opening of two additional bars in the area. In response to the desires of his constituents, he has worked to prevent their opening. 

Parent explained that the residents' concern is due to the growing student population in the area, but that no real antagonism exists yet. "I would be willing to meet with Notre Dame representatives of the off-campus community to iron out any possible problems," the councilmanstated. 
Professor A.J. Quigley, president of the Northeast Neighborhood Council, pointed out that littered lawns and excessive noise are the 

resident's' main objections to .students residing and patronizing bars in that area. "Residents of the northeast neighborhood want taverns and customers that obey laws," he said. 
"Friday and Saturday nights the noise often keeps us awake until 3 a.m., and on Sunday morning we are faced with picking up as many as two bushels of paper cups from our front lawns," Quigley complained. "Neither I nor the neighbors are anti-student; we just ask that students cooperate as good citizens to help solve these problems," said the engineering professor.Concerning any action the University might take against those Notre Dame students arrested in the Louie's raid, Macheca stated that he had not yet investigated the matter or talked with any of the students involved. He speculated, however, that because the University alcohol rule deals with "use rather than proximity," it is unlikely that the 

· students, who were charged with frequenting a tavern as minors, would be disciplined any further. Macheca emphasized, however, the need for students to be aware of Indiana's drinking laws and the consequences entailed in their violation. 
Of Louies raid 
Arrested students 

question fairness 
by Mark Jahne 
Staff Reporter 
"If Louie's is a restaurant, why can't we go in?" asked Dave and Dennis, two Notre Dame freshmen who were among the eleven persons arrested at Louie's Restaurant Wednesday night. 
Both believe that their arrests were unwarranted. They claimed they had not drunk anything alcoholic, nor was any such beverage present on their table. Neither had been there more than five minutes when the police arrived. 
Dennis said, "There's no sign to say minors can't go in. What if someone was there only to buy a pizza?" 
The students were not told their rights as police claimed that procedure applies only to felonies, not misdemeanors. Dave complained, "They treat you like common criminals.'' 
Photographs and fingerprints were taken, plus voice recordings and a videotape of each person walking in a circle. 
Dave questioned the fairness of the raid. "What's the drinking area, and what's not?" Dennis asked, "Why didn't they check in the back, too?" Apparently underage students were drinking in back, but they were not checked by the arresting officers. 
Eight of the eleven arrested were held overnight. All were released after their rectors posted bond. The last student left the jail at 5:00 a.m. Thursday morning. 
Editor's note: The last names of the two students interviewed for this story have been withheld upon request.

a firm commitment to a co-op on campus was necessary. It said "Last May both the members of the Student Affairs Committee of the board of Trustees and the president of the Notre Dame Alumni Association expressed their interest and their ability to assist in any way possible." 
"Now that time has come. Let us begin; and let us begin with a commitment in the form of a place. 
We can't afford to play 'pick and 
-find out why not' becau.~ it is so necessary and so important that we must take a solid step forward now." 
Tallarida proposed a temporary program until the ideal situation is reached. He said that if a group of off-campus students were to organize and select one person to go to the wholesaler, with an order for all, it would help cut costs. Tallarida added that this "ex­tended family" is a practical means to reducing food bills. 
McLaughlin reported that the Student Government is contacting other schools and cooperative association for furtherinsight into the matter. He stated, "You've got to expect a few mistakes but with advice from the Law and Business Schools, we can make a cooperative successful.'~

Holy Cross priest exiled 
by Tom O'Neil Staff Reporter 
In another attempt to suppress 
the "subversive activity" of the 
Holy Cross Order, the military 
government of Chile has exiled Fr. 
Robert L. Plasker, the Order's 
religious superior from Chile. 
Plasker, a 1953 graduate of Notre 
Dame, left Chile Tuesday evening 
and is expected to return to South

A "community experience" will 
highlight the weekend activities of 
the Campus Ministry on Friday 
evening beginning at 5 p.m. 
Mass and dinner for the entire Notre Dame-st. Mary's community will be served at the Bulla Shed, located across the street from Grace Tower, on the corner of Bulla Road and Eddie Street, This weekly program is open to all students, faculty and friends of the University and St. Mary's College, according to Fr. Bill Toohey, director of the Campus Ministry. , 
"I would like to emphasize that an invitation for all Campus Ministry activities is extend&! to all students from both schools-on campus, off-campus, graduate and transfer--as well as the faculty members and their families," Toohey stated. 
Continuation of the celebrity luncheon program at the Bulla Shed will also be a part of the coming Campus Ministry ac­tivities, according to Toohey, "The response by the students last year at these lunch-bull sessions was very encouraging. It really provides a great chance to sit down with Fr. Hesburgh or Coach Phelps and talk with them about anything you want," he explained. 
· Within 24 hours Plasker left the

superior in Chile, he was in charg~ of all Holy Cross schools, parishes, orphanages and other institutions, including a seminary where he served as an instructor. 
Control of the schools, however, was taken over by the government Iast year after a public airing of ideological differences. 
An official decree of expulsion 
was issued by the government against Plasker in January, charging him with anti-government activities, but it was suspended shortly afterwards for unknown reasons. A second decree was issued last Monday night without any charges or ac­cusations included. 
country. Officials of the Indiana Province of Holy Cross members have formally requested an ad­·ministrative review of the

Plasker, 54, was born in Por­tland, Oregon and ordained a Holly Cross priest in 1957. He has served as religious superior in Chile since 1970. 
Plasker should not be confused with Fr. Martin Garate who was discussed in a Wed., Sept. 18, Observer article. Garate, a subordinate to Plasker while in Chile, was exiled in June and has been living at Notre Dame ever since.

Hesburgh calls lor new world perspective 
Human survival depends upon the development of a new world perspective based on in­terdependence of mankind,Fr. Theodore Hesburgh of Notre Dame said in a lecture prepared for delivery today in England. 
Fr. Hesburgh presented his view of the earth as a ''relatively small spacecraft with very finite life resources" in the annual Ditchley Lecture, sponsored by an English 
Poorly planned 
foundation. As an example of worldwide interdependence he cited the ramifications of the recent Arah-Israeli war, which " precipitated an oil embargo which, in turn, threatened the whole Atlantic Alliance, nearly ruined Japan's economic miracle, dislocated fuel prices to an extent that will involve massive shifts in world capital balances, created a fertilizer and food crisis worldwide 
Dillon pep rally fails 
Dillon Hall bungled their pep rally last night, according to Dillon President Elton Johnson. 
"Compared to Dillon rallies of the past, it was a failure," Johnson said. He noted the absence of the band and the cheerleaders con­tributed to the demise of the event. 
An advertisement in yesterday's Observer stated the N.D. Band and cheerleaders would appear at the 8 p.m .rally. "It was our fault the band didn't come," Johnson admitted. "Mr. O'Brien said they couldn't accept our invitation to appear at the rally because it would commit them to play at all other hall pep rallies." 
Johnson said an understanding was reached whereby the band would march by the pep rally during their evening practice session. The Observer ad­vertisement, however, ruined those plans, he added. 
Dillon Hall submitted the misleading advertisement bec~use "we forgot what Mr. O'Brien 
said," Johnson noted. Johnson added that he had ex­
~~!i;:rt~~:tif)=~e~~~: to ::~ 
Grabavoy said the cheerleaders failed to attend the rally because of 
a "foul-up in communications." 
According to Grabavoy, many of 
the cheerleaders did not find out 
about the pep rally until yesterday 
afternoon and the squad voted not 
to perform.
"The cheerleaders want to be at 
the pep rallies and be an integral 
part of campus spirit, but we have 
to be contacted in advance," she 
said. 

$120 million in trusts 
By CLAY F. RICHARDS 
WASHINGTON <UPD -Vice presidential nominee Nelson Rockefeller said Thursday he is worth approximately $182.5 million, including $20 million worth of art and land he will turn over to the public after his death. 
The former New York gover­nor, one of the country's richest men, said the bulk of his assets are in two trusts valued at a total of $120 million. He did not say so, but the trusts were believed left to him by his father, John D. Rockefeller Jr. 
The total figure was believed not to include a substantial amount that Rockefeller holds jointly with his brothers. 
Rockefeller said in a pre­pared statement he was releas­ing the total amount of his net worth because of "incomplete and therefore misleading data" that had been leaked to the press over the past two weeks. 
He said he would make a 
detailed financial statement 
public at the opening of his 
confirmation hearings before 
the Senate Rules Committee 
Monday. .

He said the $33 million reported earlier in the media "did not include the value of art and real estate I have already pledged to be given away for public use and enjoyment after my death." 
"This factor alone accounts for $20.5 million of the difference," the statement said.

with possible massive starvation in the underdeveloped world and consequent political and economic chaos among the Third World's billions of peoples." 
The most urgent problem is food, said Fr. Hesburgh, who is also head of the Overseas Development Council, a Washington-based provate organization which fosters the interests of undeveloped countries. "The food situation on this planet has never been more precarious," he commented, citing an increase in food demand of fifty per cent and a diminishing reserve of world food stocks. 
"We in the developed world are consuming almost a ton of food grains annually per person while the poorest barely subsist on 400 pounds a year," he noted, pointing out that the United States, Canada ba_nkrupted by the tripling of pnces of food and fuel could come from excess profits "if the world was truly seen as interdependent." 
Globally, he argued, the poor get poorer and the rich richer. He observed that only developed countries have the technology to exploit the newest source of natural resources and food-the seas which cover 70 per cent of the earth. He chided the stubborn nationalistic self-interest of America but noted that even the United States "did more than closer European nations in providing transportation and food to starving Mricans."

Ballroom dancing arrives at Notre Dame beginning Monday, September 23, when Fran DeMarko, a professional dance instructor, gives lessons from 7 
p.m. to 9 p.m. in LaFortune Ballroom. 
Lessons will be held every Monday at the same time and place. "Training is continuous," said DeMarko. "There will always be a beginner's group." 
The two-dollar fee is payable 

to outline goals 
select a project of their own choice or take part in a large number of projects about which information is already available. 
There is a specific procedure by which students formulate their work. Small independent research groups will meet at their own convenience throughout the research period. However, they must submit their title for ap­proval to the InPIRG board of directors prior to starting and again with the finished product. Publication of the report would then take place and subsequent litigation would follow. 
The meeting was highlighted by six students who have already begun research. 

Andy Burner presented plans for the study of small claims courts. Burner pointed out that many cities around the country already have these courts but that South Bend does not. 
The court would be a great benefit to citizens, enabling them to receive quick settlement on merchandise or personal disagreements involving less that $500. It costs only six dollars to file, whereas in the current system, conflicts are sent to the Justice of the Peace court where it is mandatory to have a lawyer.

After teaching at several high schools in St. Joseph County,DeMarko is now "up the ladder of fame," as she says, and is presently teaching at Notre Dame. "Touch dancing is now the name of the game," she remarked. "It's an epidemic.'· 
If not exacey an epidemic, ballroom dancing has become increasingly popular on college campuses across the country since 1973. An article appE:aring in the 
National Enquirer over the summer states: "A recent college survey reveals (that) students are flocking to dan<'e classes to learn the fox trot, lind), rock, waltz and cha-cha.'' 
"There are only two ways to dance," remarked De Marko, "either apart or together, and the popularity of the lessons tells us something."

Pricing survey is headed by Blaise Mercandante. On the first and third weeks of every month, students would· go out to a number of area grocery stores and price food and various consumer goods. 
A computer program would statistically validate the in­formation obtained and the results would be posted in the Observer and other news media. 
Lisa Molidor, Mark Clark, Pic Pettelle, and Shickich gave ad­ditional reports in the areas of sex discrimination, state food in­spection, EPA effluent discharge standards (pollution), and rights of mental patients. 
One of the most important breakthroughs of InPUiG oc­curred last year and concerned Indiana Bell. lnPIRG filed petition before the Public Service Com­mission of Indiana in February of 1973, trying to block the proposed $35 million rate increase and proposed doubling of pay telephone charges. The eventual PSCI decision granted Bell a $23 million increase and denied them the double pay phone charge. 

In concluding the meeting, Shickich stressed that there would be no pressure deadlines for the completion of the projects, yet they would have to be very thorough, well documented and virtually unassailable.

Tickets for the Gordon Lightfoot concert will go on sale Wednesday, September 25 at 9:00 in the A.C.C. and 1:30 in the Student Union ticket office. There is a limit of 8 tickets that you can buy. I would like to add that all of the good seats are not at the A.C.C. ticket office. The·A.C.C. and Student Union equally share all the tickets for the good seats. So if you're too late to get a ticket for a seat in the front row at the A.C.C., you can go to the Student Union and be the tirsL one in line there. 
Do I have to mail a letter through the Federal Post Office to have it delivered on campus? 
You don't have to any more. The campus mail system is now in operation. You just put the correct address on the envelope and deposit it in one of the campus mail boxes located around the campus (no stamp is necessary). 
Is there any truth to the rumor that the Chicago Freestreet Theater will be putting on a performance on campus? 
Your information is partly correct, the Chicago Freestreet Theater will be putting on a performance here but not on ~e campus. The~e will be two performances on Saturday at the R1ver Bend Plaza m South Bend, at 12 noon and at 3:00p.m. 
I'm having trouble finding the Service Commission in LaFortune so 1 can pick up my Freshman Photo Directory. Can you give me instructions on how to get there. 
The Service Commission Office is in a very out-of-the-way place and it took me some time to find it also. It is in the northeastern part of the second floor in LaFortune. It is in the eastern end of the hall of the Student Government Office. It's entrance is hidden by an empty ply-wood magazine rack. After passing the magazine rack you enter into a room with several offices in it. The Service Commission is the office to the far left (it is the only office without a sign on the door saying what office it is). If you hav~ a~y further problems just ask the Student Government Recepbomst or the Ombudsman Service at the opposite end of the hall. 
NOTE: The Ombudsman Service has new hours. In addition to its regular hours of 9:30 to 5:00 it now offers its services to the Notre Dame and SMC students from 10:00 to 12:00 midnight.

Co-op Need Real 
The food co-op needs to be. 
University administration cannot rack up the implementation of this first real breakthrough of assistance for the off-campus student. Those living off-campus have been neglected far too long. They now need the help of the University realistically. 
Last Monday, a plan for a food-cooperative to improve the off­campus living conditions was outlined by Pat McLaughlin, student body president. The same day John Macheca, dean of students, and Fr. Thomas Tallarida, director of off-campus housing, vowed to improve living conditions for off-campus students. 
In cooperation, the co-op is more than a possibility. It's real and only awaiting organization. 
Granted, there are a number of snags that would need work but the basic motive is there--to aid students, faculty and staff in reducing their grocery bill. It would be a direct form of assistance for off­campus students which is past due from the University. 
Hollow expressions of concern have been made to the off-campus student too often. And never has sympathy been sought or solicited. They are a part of Notre Dame and deserve nothing more or less than the on-campus student. 
Yet theirs has always been less. 
The co-op would offer lower food prices through bulk purchases. Savings are passed on to the customers by eliminating mark-ups in the prices for profit. 
As detailed in their report, which indicated an impressive amount of research, McLaughlin and his off-campus commissioners have considered all angles for implementation of the co-op, including licensing, prices and management. The major stumbling block is now a facility. 
If recent vows are sincere, then certainly some assistance should be available. Existing structures on campus do not immediately present a ready-made place. But a consideration of building priorities by the University might yield a starting point. The use of a pre-fab structure could also be investigated. 
The possibility of including the food co-op in the incomplete LaFortune renovation plans could be discussed as well. 
Contrary to Fr. Tallarida's premature observation of the un­feasibility of the co-op, it needs to be. And with a little help from our "friends," it's real.

"I played a lot of sports, you know. But as this thing kept building up inside of me. I started to measure every Uttle movement. I'd watch the way I threw a ball, the way I walked, I'd watch to see if my ass wigled a little." 
Outside my window tonight, there is a pep rally. Thousands of screaming faces, cheering and yelling; giving support to one another. 
Tonight somwhere, there is someone walking alone. Afraid , very paranoid, removed from his world be a simple fact which pervades his future existence. 
The situation at Notre Dame for gays is painfully lonely. There have been gay awareness groups on campus before, but they concentrated on student activism; on backing the administration other students, many times each other against the wall. 1t became somewhat self-destructive, for there was an essential element missing: the support of the spirit, of the inner person. 
Tonight, two people who are concerned about this situation told me about an organization they are planning. It is called, simply, "Gay Students of Notre Dame" and offers an alternative to the situation as it exists for homosexuals in the Notre Dame com­munity. 
The need to identify 
It is an organization which emphasizes support. Support for the spirit that has been battered and wounded, that has remained hidden and cut-()ff. A spirit that, despite its being all but murdered by denial, returns again and again asking to be recognized. 
The gay students at Notre Dame need a place, a situation, where they can find someone with whom they can identify. Gay students are desperately in need of a place where they can be themselves, apart from the pressures and tensions which derive from society's general attitude about homosexuality. 
"Gay students of Notre Dame" will try and offer that alternative 
It will emphasize supp6rt, identification, a degree of anonymity, and a separation from the spirit of activism that has been so self­destructive in previous gay groups. 
To offer a means of growth 
The organizers hope to offer a means of "growth with a sense of definity" for homosexuals , both male and femal~. 
. Stude.nts .~xpressi!lg an interest i~ the group are not "making a hfe ~boiCe, accordmg to the orgamzers. The group will be loose, flexible, adaptabletothe needs and desires of its members. 
There is only one goal they wish to achieve: an alternative to thP loneliness of being gay at Notre Dame. 
They are aware of the problems and pitfalls that await them. There will be people entering the group who will have expectations thatcannotrealistically be fulfilled, or would be destructive. The will always be the temptation to challenge openly the attituues of others at the University, but they will work to avoid this. ."We know _the answers they will give to our questions," one of the orgamzers· says," so why put our own existence on the line." 
Anonymity the key 
For now ,at least the organizers are keeping up an atmosphere of anonymity for themselves. Anonymity will be one of the key elements of the group, but for now it is even more important that the workings of the group remain quiet and played-down. It is a realistic response to the situation here. 
Another realistic response is their decision to meet off-campus. One of the orgnizers has been active in gay groups on-campus for the last two years, and feels that meeting here produces an at­mosphere of insecurity which intrudes on what is being attempted. 
They are opening the door of their shelter, despite the infringing, raging storm outside. They are opening the door so that those left outside can find some refuge, some relief and warmth from the relentless atmosphere and pressure. 
It won't besoeasy for those outside tu decide to enter. Though they will not be making a life choice, it will still takes courage to admit to the darkness, to admit t the felings that have been so long denied and repressed.

Bicycles are a happy compromise 
by Fred Graver Contributing Editor 

The bicycle is one of man's greatest inv_entions. For one thing, it is very difficult to say anythmg bad about it. Unlike automobiles, which are infinitely more difficult to repair, kill people, and poison the air, bicycles are machines which promote health and well­
being. . . 
Bicycles are a happy compromtse between walking and driving. The only reason I can think of not to ride a bike somewhere is foul weather, and even then I may have second thoughts. (Riding in the rain can be as enjoyable as riding in good weather, it all d~pends on your attitude.)
"But " you may say, "bicycles are not as fast. What if I ha~e to get somewhere quickly?" Now, I'm not crazy enough to hand you the line about "why do you have to rush everywhere". I know how things can get sometimes. But, if you make the effort to consider all the places it would be nice to ride a bike to, you can come up with quite a few. This sort of thinking may even lead you to re-orient your values, set you straight and clean-living. 
Any flaw that you can pick out in a bicycle will most likely derive from your own biases and prejudice, (for example: it's too much work), or from environmental difficulties (it's snowing; there are too many cars). The advantagous use of the bicycle requires determination to make the best use of a totally func­tional machine. 
The last five years or so have witnessed an incredible resurgence of interest in the bicycle. It can only mean that people are beginning to regain their sanity abc?ut recreation and leisure time, perhaps about the bastes of transportation.
On one bicycle trip I took over the summer, I had lunch with an old black postman who, admiring my bike, told me how much he liked riding himself. This guy was sixty-four years ol~ and rode two or ~ree miles every weekend. "And 1f them damn gas prtces go up anymore, "he told me, "I'll be riding a hell of a lot more." 
He went on to say how much it disturbed him that 
people are so lazy· they seldom do any-thing without 
stepping on a gas pedal. No wonder they're so fat and 
worn down . .' he said. 
Hopefully, the rise in bicyclists indicates a rise in enthusiasm for getting out in the open again, for stepping away from the trappings of "progress". In some ways, deciding to take a trip on a bike, whether it's for a few miles or a few days, is taking a chance on the unknown. And that's the beauty of the whole trip. All you have to do is stay open to what's going on around. The isolation and awkward responsibility of possessing or being possessed by an automoble is gone, leaving you with freedom and a new involvement between you and the immediate environment. 
TOURING VS. DAY-BICYCLING . 
.. when considering two bicycle trips, there are two basic classifications. (This gets so ridiculously ob­vious after a while that soon you are going to realize just how simple bicycling is.) The first type is the day­trip. To the cycle purist, you are considered definitely "part-time" when you engage in these, but if you're-not up to the longer tour (either physically or mentally), then by All mean:;, _the day Trip is recommended. 
All you have to do to do one is to leave from and return 
to the same place in one day. (See, I told you this was 
simple.)
The second type is the touring or camping trip. Long 
distance traveling is for the purist, for the individual 
who shares some of the qualities of the hitch-hiker, 
with a bit more discipline.
Discipline seems to be the key here. In addition to 
decent equipment, a good bike, and a bit ?f ~on­
ditioning, it requires self-control. Nobody in therr rtght 
mind will go fifty or sixty miles on a bike in one day, so 
the thing to do is get yourself out of your right mind. 
Long-distance trips can lead to ecstasy or disgust. 
It's all in the element of the unknown. There may be a 
definite destination, a definite route, a. definite 
schedule for everything (in fact, it is recommended 
that a good deal of planning go into any trip), but noone can tell what is actually up ahead-on the road. Bicyclists are as vulnerable and open to the,wiles and whimsies of the road as any traveler can pessible be. Experience is varied. 

You can experience, in the course of one day on a trip, the intimidation of an Air Stream trailer trying to force you off the road (using the extended rear-view mirror as a lance), the terror of a howling farm dog headed right for your bare ankles, or the simple pleasure of stumbling on the grand opening of "Hank's Super Standard" (and what a party that was-I wob­bled for miles aft~.(. 
RIDING AND TOURING TIPS 
You have two things to contend with on this trip: your bicycle and your self. To keep the bike going requires only a simple bit of maintenance knowledge. To keep your self going-well, it's easier to know what makes your bike go.
Like most machines, your body has a limited capacity to vary speeds without breaking down. Find a pedaling rhythm and stay with it. For most riders, this "cadence" falls between seventy and eighty crank revolutions per minute. Use your gears to find the optimum rate. 
Vary the position of your hands on the handlebars. (Why am I telling you this? Because someone told me, and I'm glad they did. So just listen up: there will be a quiz at the end of the period. ) Find the most com­fortable positions for riding up and down hills, for coasting, and for heavy pedaling. 
Pedaling technique is tremendously important. It's called "ankling", and is incredible helpful for in­creasing efficiency on long trips. Place the balls of your feet on the pedals (never pedal any other way). Tilt the foot up at the top of each stroke, ~nd down at the bottom. Now, let's try it. Up. Down. Up. Down. 
Very good, class. 
Your ankle should be constantly swiveling in syn­chronization with the crank motion. The ankles act as levers to deliver m~re power to the crank without any great increase in po~:er from the legs. Thank God for efficiency. (Toe clips are very helpful here.) 
HAZARDS 
Now is the time we talk about a group of people who are going to join you on your trip, whether you want them (unlikely) or not (likely): Drivers. For the cyclist, it is an unfortunate fact of life that bicycles and automobiles have been delegated to the same roads. It is an unhappy marriage, as any veteran biker will tell you. ·mere ts a popular theory that bicycles trigger a subliminal response in many drivers which make them aim the car over to the side of the road, just.:."far enough to force the cyclist into the ditch, the retaining wall, or whatever else awaits him. 
There is not much you can do about this, outside of some insane alternatives. For example: there was, in 1933, a racket group in New York's Central Park called "The Bloody Bicyclists". (I swear, this is absolutely true.) They would prepare for a days work by donning torn trousers, ripped and bloodstained shirts, and scratched and e:orv Jells. In relays thev would work the 
·-';~'-;,{'%"';~ ·;· 
·-~ '' ..-. --', A a·':r ·-'~ roaas surrounrung the park, riding their bikes in front of cars and then crashing into the nearest wall or fence. 
The " victim" would then berate the motorist, and con him into paying from $10 to $25 to avoid beingreported. 
A friend of mine once told me another means of handling the dread crazy driver. When cars were headed his way, he would wobble a little bit just to throw fear into their hearts. Most drivers, he figured, were more afraid of really hurting someone than they were in·_ being sadistic. I refuse to recommend either method. You'll just have to find it deep within your moral fibre to face these demons. 
I refuse to recommend either method. You'll justhave to find it deep within your moral fi _ 
If you are heading into the city, probably on a day­trip, you will soon discover that it takes a special breed of cyclist to handle the traffic. Here are some tips.: 
-Don't get squeezed into the curb or forced into parked cars. They hurt, especially old Cadillacs with fatal tail fins. 
-Always rid,e with the traffic, never against, 1)0 matter what Officer Friendly told you in grammarschool. 
-Watch for parked cars._ Thev tend to open the doors at the funniest times. _(Ha-ha. "Do you mind if I ge1 my teeth from across the street, mister?") 
-Intersections call for extreme caution. Try to make sure your enemies seeyou. Yell, use your little bell, get a foghorn attatched to the handle bars, etc. If you're in the right lane, don't expect right-turners to give youthe right-of-way. They won't. 
-If possible, avoid the main routes and rush-hour. Other hazards include oil slicks, potholes, bicycle­eating sewer grates, pebbles and broken glass children who like to throw any of the above, and dogs.' Try .to out-maneuver, avoid, slash, whip, spit at, or wl:!_~tever is appropriate to the hazard. 
The most bizarre thing I ever heard about happened to the wobbler-friend of mine. He was riding through Idaho, I believe, in total no-man's land. No farms, no towns just forest. It seems a large flock of birds had built a small community around a mile-long stretch of road here, and were quite protective when it came to anything going down this stretch of road. My friend was one of these things. 
Shades of Hitchcock! !! As he entered this heart of darkness, a bird landed on his head and began pecking gently away at his scalp. Nothing budged him so my friend put his bike in gear and high-tailed it as 'best he could out of there. The bird rode him safely away from the nests, and then flew away. 
Like I said, the element of the unknown is the best thing about bike trips. 
Which brings us to ... PLANNING There are some excellent guidebooks and books 
about bike tripping. Two of them can be found in the Bibliography. (Continued on page 9)

Plan to buy a bike? Caveat emptor! 
This is going to be short, because once we started tending to detail we would be getting out of our league. There's just too much to say to claim total credibility in this area, so we'll stick to basics. 
Bicycling in the past four years has become big, big, big business. Thus, when entering a bicycle store, be on your guard. Know that there are no bargains in good· bikes; price is commensurate to quality. If you have the money, even if you have to borrow your best friend's last dime, by all means buy a foreign bike. They are, simply, much better than the American product. If you do choose to buy American, Schwinn is the most reliable manufacturer. 
There are five main con­siderations in bicycle purchasing: 
1) the quality of the bike 
2) the bike's use 
3) the bike's cost 

4) the physical condition and size of the buyer 
5) the buyer's personal tastes 
Of the five, two stand out: quality and taste. Unfortunately, the two can also be the most irreconcilable. 
To find out if a bicycle is of high quality, talk to the dealer. Ignore all the lines he hands you about color, appearance, popularity, etc. 
Ask about the parts. Sooner or later, if he sees that you are· using your head about this and asking rather intelligent questions, he will begin to be straightforward about his merchandise. 
Have the dealer explain the differences between various makes and models. His recom­mendations can generally be trusted (unless you are buying at a department or discount house -for~ your own good, buy only at bicycle shops). The quality of certain components, especially the derailleur, gears and the brakes are worth checking out. 
Used touring bikes can sometimes turn out to be true treasures, since their owners spend a lot of time and energy keeping them up. First, as with new bikes, familiarize yourself with models and prices. 

Keep it in good shape 

Maintenance assures safety 

After you've been riding for a while, you can begin to pick up on certain sounds your bike gives off. If things are going well, the bike is almost silent, and runs. efficiently· Beware though, when this quiet harmony is interrupted by the unwelcome and dread "chinka­chinka," or some similar noise. If you don't do comething about this soon, there could be big troubles up ahead. 
To avoid hearing the sounds of pain and misery from your bike, here are a few things you can do to keep it healthy and happy. 
Grease and Oil: Any bearings on a bike which are packed with grease will stay lubricated, under normal conditions, for six months or more. Any bearings which are left out in the rain or buried in sand will stay -lubricated about six hours. If your bearings are greased, keep them from excess moisture (rain) and don't oil them. Overhaul and grease them once or twice a year, then leave them alone. 
The chain on any bike should be lightly coated with fine oil at all times. A light oil, like 3-in-1, will do. If you leave your bike outside, check the chain frequently. 



Things to or adjust: 
WHEELS: Check the big axle 
nuts or quick-release levers or 
tightness. 
TIRES: Keep the pressure at the 
number of pounds designated on 
the side of the tire. Check for 
wear. 
HAND BRAKES: Keep ad­
justed. The end of the hand lever 
should travel roughly two inches 
when the brakes are applied fully. 
Check the shoes to make sure that 
they aren't cock-eyed or loose. 
CHANGER: 3-speed -Check 
the indicator. Make sure the 
locknut is locked. 
10-speed --Check the control lever adjustable bolts. Check the range of the changer and adjust with the adjustable screws. 
PEDAL: Check that the spindle is locked against the crank. 
All the repairs and overhauls you need to do can be accomplished with the following tools. You may or may not need all of these, depending on how well you can adapt your tools to the versatile uses they were intended for. But some variety is necessary, since real damage can ·be done to the more fine and delicate components by using the wrong tools. (i.e. screwdrivers when replacing tires, monkey wrenches to tighten gears, hammer to straighten spokes). 
Very necessary: 
Crescent wrench hammer 
Screwdriver Pliers 
Cable Clipper Lubricants 
Tire Irons Tire Repair Kit 
Tnere are many more tools associated with bike repair, but we haven't the time to go into them here. We also don't have the in­terest of many of you to go any further. 
Booking can help for better biking 
Anybody's Bike Book. by Tom Cuthbertson. (Ten Speed Press. $3.00.) This is subtitled "an original manual of bicycle repairs", which pretty well describes it. The author holds to the CQntention that "if you can ride 'em, you can fix 'em". The book makes good reading even if you're not interested in the repair of bicycles, because of Cuthbertson's easy con­versational style. "Frankz Kafka once said 'There is only one human sin-impatience'. Not that I expect you to keep your patience when that tire bead bites off your finger and thenjumps off the rim. When you've just got to throw something, don't throw the wheel. Grab a handy wrench and throw it. It will make a much more satisfying clang and won't bend.") The illustrations are enjoyable, and at times pretty funny. You can learn a lot from this book. Tom Cuth­bertson is also the author of another exceptional book, Bike Tripping, which deals with the touring aspect of cycles. But for the best information on that. .. 
Vagabonding in America. by Ed Buryn. (Random House, Bookworks. $4.95.) A large and beautiful volume of in­formation (both external and internal) about getting around these States. Absolutely everything you need to know, even a chapter dedicated to helping you find out if you are really ready to make a long trip. Once chapter deals with bicycle touring, and contains a good deal of helpful advice and in­spiration. Tremendous reading all, around, though, and great for feeding the Wanderlust.. 
The Complete Book of Bicycling. by Eugen A. Sloan. <Trident Press-simon and Schuster. $9.95). Notice how these books get more expensive as we go down the list. Somewhat reminiscent of the funeral parlor shell game entitled "You know, you'll probably spend something truly equivalent to the love you felt." · 
Well, if you're carrying on an illicit affair with your machine, this is the "Joy of Sex" of cycling. Though not as cheerful as Cuthbertson's book, it is much more extensive and technical. Enough illustrations and information to enable the reader to declare himself an authority. 
The author is a man who rides his bike 30 miles a day into Chicago, commuting to work. It takes a stone fanatic like that to write an exhaustive book like this. 
The Complete Walker. by Colin Flethcer. (Alfred Knopf. $7.95) Slowly on our way down from the high-price bracket. Flethcer is an inspiration to anyone who wants to get out and away. He writes mainly about walking. In "The Man who Walked Through Time", he told of his hiking the entire Grand Canyon. The Complete Walker is less reflective and more informational than his other books. A good deal of advice useful to people planning on long bike tours. High on detail, and also on inspiring style. Colin faithfully com­municates his enthusiasm for the outdoors, loves to poke fun at himself, and has been known to spend pages defending some useless personal idiosyncracy just so you'll go out and

So baggies, sandals, tennis dresses, and all of their fashionable counterparts are out of the question.

by Pattie Cooney Contributing Editor 

Mrs. Karen O'Neil has been appointed director of St. Mary's placement bureau, replacing Janice Wheaton who has taken another position out of state. 
For the past year O'Neil has served as director of housing at SMC. 
"Right now we are working on several projects," said O.'Neil, "For instance, we will be actively looking for companies that have positions for liberal arts students as well as business and science students," In addition we will be working with the Notre Dame placement office," she continued. 
O'Neil plans to send out a newsletter to each class every month. "I think career awareness should start freshman year, not in the crunch of the second semester of senior year. The letter to the freshmen will be geared towards self assessment, advising them to start thinking about their goals and values, and how they relate into a work style. 
The sophomore newsletter will deal with relating different academic areas to career levels. The junior letter focuses on giving specific information on careers, where to look for a job, what the pay scales are, etc. 
The letter to the seniors will deal with specifics for writing resumes, signing up for and attending in­terviews and the problems they face upon graduation," she ex­plained.

One of the major responsibilities of the placement office is to help students prepare for job hunting and interviews. "I feel that women face a lot of problems men don't face when looking for a job. However if the students here know what they face before they leave here, they'll be better prepared," O'Neil said. 
O'Neil graduated from St. Mary's in 1971. She will continue to hold her position as director of housing until Sept. 23. 
Working with O'Neil in placement are Terry Bowman, Kathy Rogers, Cindy Kujik, Patty Doyle and Linda Temple.

To handle these questions, Ombudsman must be able to ex­tract information from various sources including administrative, faculty and staff members. An honest and direct approach is essential, stressed McLean, since the Ombudsman "doesn't have power clout as its strength but rather access to people." 
Bes!des strengthening thl) ef­fectiveness of the Ombudsman, the reception served to initiate members to the organization. As Ombudsman staff members graduate, new workers must establish relations with sources so that the mediator role of the Ombudsman may effectively continue. "The reception provided a way to simply say, "Thank you to the people who helped us in the past," McLean noted. 
Guests attending the reception included newly appointed University Chaplain Fr. Robert Griffin, Fr. Terry Lally, Fr. Ed­mund Joyce and James Roemer, University Counsel. 
The reception, held in the Om­budsman offices, was arranged by Matt Cockrell, Internal Development qfficer of Ombud­sman.

Friday, September 20, 1974 the observer 1 1 

The other day, a group of concerned students asked me to say Mass at the Grotto during October for the unborn children whose lives have been terminated by abortion. I told them that I don't understand how the offer;ug of Mass would be of value or assistance to foetuses interrupted on their journey into life. "I couldn't begin to understand the tt-eological implications of such a liturgy," I said. "Even infants who die after birth do not require the prayers of the Church. Whatever links to immortality an embryonic life has, I am sure that im­mortality is safe in the hands of God." 
Instead of Mass for the unborn innocents, which would seem to me like a sentimental, somewhat futile gesture, I made another suggestion: why not have Mass for the parents who have chosen abortion or are considering abortion as a choice preferable to the birth of an unwanted child? 
To offer to pray for someone, you know, has at times a certain nervineu about it: as though you, the praying one, lived on a superior moral plane, and were blesaed with a truer vision and the higher graces ; and your Christian morality were ~;:iding herd on the shiftless conduct of the unwashed mob. God deliver me from seeming pushy with piety. As I would deal with other men, I hope that they would also deal with me: praying for me in my sins, assisting me in my agonies, wishing me the peace of a quiet conscience. 
During the summer, a couple whom I am 
fond of were faced with a difficult decision. 
The woman, who suffers from a disease 
requiring filters in the blood stream to 
prevent clotting, became pregnant with her 
sixth child. Her doctors, who had warned 
against pregnancy, were certain that if the 
woman insisted on carrying the child, both 
master of mystery and suspense 
Alfred Hitchcock is the cinematic master of mystery and suspense. His films represent a sardonic blend of misanthropic musings and artistic intelligence. Con­sistently, he seeks out and explores that vast grey area between lily white goodness and pitch black evil. And always, for Hitchcock, this evil lurks beneath a facade of innocence and normalcy. Unearthed,· it serves to represent the Hitchcock vision of life in all its complexity and volatility. 
Thus, in a sense, the director's audience becomes more than mere onlookers. First, they are part and parcel of the resi<iingevil within our tenuous human condition. Secondly, they are participants in ex­plorations into Hitchcockian reality. Hit­chcock is so technically adept in the cinematic medium that he seems to control us as we become totally absorbed in his presentation on the screen. In "Psycho", we are lulled into a sense of serenity as a woman sings lightly to herself in the shower. 
Then suddenly, a vague figure appears behind the curtain and a viscious butchering occurs. In "The Birds", Tippi Hedren sits outside a schoolhouse smoking a cigarette, a few birds perched on a telephone wire in the background. Then a closeup of Hedren's face for a few moments, followed by a pulling back of the camera to reveal hun­dreds of birds in the schoolyard. A quick closeup of Hedren's face as she notices the birds reveals the unsettling anxiety of the scene-the natural balance of things has been upset. 
Hitchcock employs even more subtle means to convey his meaning. Purposely, he chooses handsome actors to portray his "villains", as is the case wi~ a youthful Joseph Cotten playing a psychopathic killer in "Shadow of Doubt". Often his climatic scepes ta,k,e place ~t .t\1~ .~te. pf f~mili~r national landmarks such as Mt. Rushmore mother and infant would die. To prevent this double tragedy, they said, an abortion was necessary. The couple took it to the Lord in prayer; they consulted priests and sought alternate medical advice. Finally, the difficult decision was made, and an abortion was performed, the couple feeling sure that this operation was a necessary event. But afterwards, Catholic relatives said to the mother: "If you had only had faith, nothing is impossible to God. Your own mother risked her life in a similar kind of emergency: you were born, and your if they judge themselves harshly, God's love is never more fatherly than when it reveals itself as forgiveness. 
Would it be offensive, then, for me to pray with others at a Grotto Mass for couples like these friends of mine who have made dif­ficult decisions? 
Celibates like me may have an exaggerated sense of the drama involved in performing the sexual act, just as laymensometimes profess to imagine that offering Mass must be a happening as filled with thunder and lightning as a visit to Mount decision that the responsibility of parents can be relieved by a surgeon's knife. At our Mass, we shall p~:ay for sensitivity toward those who must make this choice. We hope they will realize that we, too, are concerned about mothers whuse physical or mental health is threatened by childbirth;· and about those children who will be born to parents without the resources, the love, or the commitment to guard their infancies. 
The most terrifying symbol I can imagine of irresponsibility in modern life is that of an pbortion clinic, with technicians and

mother lived." No priest has yet talked the couple out of their guilt feelings; some haven't even tried. 
There is a reckless conviction on my part that if decent, sensitive people have engaged, even under casual circumstances, in the self-giving required for the begetting of a human life, then the surgical ter­mination of that life must cost them a price in suffering, sometimes a terrible price that they will be paying all their lives. Abortion is, after all, a violent means of negating the consequences of a human act that needed responsibility as an atter.dant cir­cumstance. I think that heaven, in its gentle dealings, heals our guilt with mercy. Without presuming to read the human conscience, I want my friends to know that

director many times halts his score at 
crucial points to heighten tension, jux­
taposing eerie music with unsettling silence. 
Hitchcock's films are unquestionably 
highly artistic-to see them is, again, to see a 
master craftsman at work. Suspenseful plot 
structure, brilliant editing, and an uncanny 
feel for what elicits emotion from the 
viewer-these and more are always present. 
And yet, Hitchcock is also a supremem 
entertainer, a conscious blend of wit and 
artistic vision. For this he must be con­
sidered on of the greatest director's of the 
film industry. He is, as the New York Times 
has said, "A master of shock and suspense, 
of cold hororand slyly incongruous wit, he 
uses his camera the way a painter uses his 
brush, stylizing his story and giving values 
his scenarists could hardly have suspec­

Begin:1ing this Sunday, Sept. 22 at 8 p.m. t~ Cultural Arts Arts Commission's Cinema : ; will present its Alfred Hitchcock Film Fe!'tival. Five films will be shown Sunday through Thursday at 8 and 10 p.m. in the Engineering Auditorium. Admission is $1.00, patrons admitted free. The schedule is as follows:

Sinai. The truth is, of course, that the daily performance of a ritual mutes the thunder and eclipses the lightning, and sacramental inactments can become a routine manipulation of symbols and liturgical texts. A Church filled with priests jaded with the chores of Eucharistic celebration would be a mystical body needing a re-birth in the Holy Spirit. A world full of people whose sexual adventures have become as mindlessly mechanical as the spin-about of an upside-down bicycle whet!l turned by the wind in a junkshop, is a wasteland without growth, in need of rain. Eliot has described that nightmare world, but we may be closer to the horror than he was. Images occur in living scenes that are closer to us than any poet's metaphor. A pretty girl, in dif­ficulties, scans the bulletin board in the Student Union, looking for a number. A phone call arranges an afternoon visit. Soon, her difficulties will be over, without complications. No one dares to condemn this child. She just forgot one day to get her prescription filled. Her mother says: "She's not fifteen anymore. She's old enough to take care of those things herself.'' Some mother. 
So in our Grotto Mass we will remember the innocent ("Father, forgive them ... "), the ignorant, the selfish, the indifferent, and the ones who merely fear an inconvenience. We will pray for those who do not have the courage to be heroic (as it seems to them).
Our mood and conviction will be that the decision to bear children is an act of faith in God, whose providence seems more evident to some families than to others. But who are we to say it does not take courage and faith to insist that heaven receive back its own machines tearing away at the bodies of women, ending foetal life· at the rate of dozens of deaths in an hour, hundreds in a day. It is' the horror of the Wasteland, a parody of all laws guaranteeing man's right to be free. One's personal freedom must be conditioned by the rights of others, in­cluding those to whom our bodies have given the heartbeat of life. 
Hopefully, in our Grotto Mass, our only judgments will be on ourselves, realizing that the decision to visit the abortion clinic is affected by many pressures, some of them our own: "The landlord won't allow children," and I am the landlord; a couple cannot afford to raise a child, and I am a rich man without compassion; society condemns the unmarried mother, and I am an unprincipled blatherskite. The birth of a child should be a celebration for all of us. 
The death of a child under a doctor's supervision, and with his tools, diminishes me , just as do the deaths of all those other men for whom the bell tolls. If I would understand the suffering that gives up a child, I must share with parents their fears, risks, hardships, shame, sacrifice, and discouragements. Then I would know what it costs them to take care of a family. 
Finally, then, I must go to the Grotto to pray for myself, asking for the generosity to exercise a fatherhood, if the opportunity comes my way, as a support or a surrogate parent to any child, anywhere, to whom my care can give life. 
I care about the children, I care about the parents; otherwise I would never say Maps m that Grotto at all.

By THOMAS FERRARO 
RICHMOND <UPI) -An active marijuana ingredient appears to be an effective anti­depressant for cancer patients who have problems coping with the disease, Medical College of Virginia researchers said Thursday. 
The patients did not experi­ence the so-called marijuana"high" from taking the agent, Delta 9-thc, according to Dr. William Regelson, chairman of MCV's Department of Medical Oncology, who headed the study. 
But he said many of the patients had "less depression, undergoing chemotherapy, he

longer than six months. 
by Chris Bock Staff Reporter 

The Saint Mary's fencing team is in their third week of practice preparing to defend the Great Lakes Tourney title which they won last year. 
The team opens its season against Tri·stateat Angola, Ind. on Jan. 17. Coach Richard Rosinski hopes to organize a week-long eastern swing including Cleveland Annapolis, and New York afte~ Angola. 
In preparation for their first 
'meet, fencing practice is held daily at the ACC. During the two­hour sessions the girls go through a period of long-distance running, calisthenics, footwork exercises and bouting and blade work. ' 
Rosinski pointed out that Mike DeCicco, varsity fencing coach at Notre Dame, had a strong in­fluence in organizing a girl's fencing program. He helps in­struct the girls during their practices. 
"DeCicco is a fencing master," stated Rosinski. "He works very hard teaching the girls the proper techniques of fencing." 
The fencing team is a relatively new organization started in 1971. Under the coaching of Rosinski and DeCicco, the team has im­proved from a 2-3 record in their first year, to a 14-3 record and the Great Lakes Tourney Cham­pionship in 1974. 
The fencing team is made up of girls from St. Mary's and Notre Dame. ReturniQg veterans are Jody Boniferd, Sue Krakora, Anne Werner, Kathy Valdisseri, and Cindy Rebholz, the tea~ captain.

Conswner' protection bill fails 
WASHINGTON <UPI) -By a two-vote margin, the Senate killed Thursday legislation that would have created a consumer protection agency. 
On a 64-34 vote, proponents of the bill fell two short of the necessary two-thirds majority in their fourth and final attempt to rescue the legisla­tion from a filibuster that had droned on for two months. 
Supporters of the measure blamed its downfall on massive lobbying by big business and President Ford's non-commital stand. 

The House had overwhelm­ingly passed the legislation earlier this year but Senate Democratic Leader Mike Mans­field, who had allowed the unusual fourth try at ending the debate, said the issue would be dead for this year if it failed again. 
The Consumer Federation of America said Ford's "ominous silence" on the issue helped seal its fate. 
"It is clear that pressures from big business altered the President's thinking on the most vital piece of consumer legislation of the decade," the organization said in a state­ment. 
"Consumers regard Mr. Ford's silence as a slap in the face," it added. "Just as his predecessor sided with business against consumers on every vital issue, Mr. Ford is showing where his loyalties lie, just as the senators who opposed the cloture vote (to end debate) showed theirs."

North western bus trip 
The Northwestern football game bus trip sponsored by the junior class officers will leave the circle near the main gate at 9 a.m. The officers ask that all those attending the trip take extra care to be on time since the departure time will be strictly enforced. The buses will leave Northwestern ap­proximately one-half hour after the game .

Opposition to the bill was led primarily by the U. S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, although some big corporations had broken with those organiza­
tions  and  were  backing  the  
measure.  
The  bill  would  have  estab­ 

lished a 250-man agency with a three-year budget of $60 million to act as an advocate for the consumer in the halls of government. In theory it would have been able to intervene for the consumer when other agencies were making decisions regarding price, safety and other issues. 
Proponents claimed the con­sumer needed the agency because they now have no one to counteract the influence of high-paid lobbyists and lawyers representing big business. Op­ponents said the agency would throw a monkey wrench into the operations of government, and the way to help consumers should be to get existing agencies functioning properly. 
It was the strongest showing in the Senate yet by backers of the bill, but they failed to switch enough votes to make the difference. 
Sen. Charles H. Percy, R-lll., said "narrow special interest groups" had "combined to literally line the halls of th Senate office buildings over the past several weeks with the 
b~e:-money lobbys that have misrepresented this bill from the outset." Percy, Sen. Abraham Ribi­
coff, D-conn., had all predicted in advance of the vote that another try would be made next year, with the chances good for an even stronger version of the legislation emerging. 
But opponents, led by Sens. James B. Allen, D-Ala., and Sam Ervin Jr., D-N.C., said they hoped the issue was dead. 
Ervin told the Senate the bill would have given the adminis­trator of the agency authority that would "make an absolute eastern potentate turn greenwith envy."

Mark  is  an  articulate,  per­ 

sonable fellow with a college grade point just below the Dean's List who betrays the common label of "monster" or "no-nothing" that is often attached to football lineman. 
Mark has enough credits . to graduate in December and his future plans call for either graduate school or the right job offer. That right job offer could be pro ball. "If I remain healthy, if the money 
is right, and if I still love the game after this season would determine whether I go pro or not," concluded Brenneman. 
If his college career is any in­dication, then the future looks bright for Mark Brenneman. As Coach Hickey put it, "He is super with people, likes to talk and has a great love for life. Not just a football player but the complete Notre Dame man."
