California starts slow recovery 

LOS ANGELES (UPI) -A 68 year old man trapped for 58 hours beneath the rubble of a veterans hospital which col­lapsed in Tuesday's earthquake was brought out alive yesterday in apparent good condition. 
Frank Carbonara, a member of the dietary staff, was found in an air pocket in the kitchen whc:re he could gulp enough air to survive. 
The death toll attributed to Van Norman Reservoir should be dropped sufficiently by today to end the danger of the flat­tered dam bursting, enabling the 120,00,0 evacuated residents of the valley below to return to their homes. 
Reports cf damage were still being assembled, but County Engineer John Lambie estimated total property loss would exceed $1 billion.

Another rush hour traffice jam choked traffic on surface streets in the area where free­ways were still closed. The Cali­fornia Highway Patrol braced for an even more monumental tieup as Angelenos headed out of tr.e city for the four day weekend holiday. 
Lines of people stood at fire stations wailing to get pink passes to enable them to enter the evacuated area briefly for emergency reasons. One man said his family had 26 horses at a stable which had to be fed. 
Crews still dug into the wreck­age of the veterans hospital but the air of urgency was gone. 
Dr. Solomon Metzer, assistant cheif of the medical staff, said most of the victims there had been old men who were being treated for ailments such as tuberculosis, emphysema, psychiatric disorders and other chronic illnesses. 
"Many of them depended on hour to hour care even before the quake hit," Metzer 8aid, "The disaster only served to destroy the already delicate ba­lance. Those who may have sur­vived getting crushed probably died from the dust and heat."

New educational aims envisioned by Christin 
by Ann-Therese Darin Education in 1980 should aim to propagate trust and concern· for man stated Dr. Robert Chris­tin, president of St. Norbert's College, in SMC"s Contemporary Trends in Education series Wed­
nesday  night.  
"The  present  educational  
system  has  failed  to  educate  

people for the really important things: for change, how to learn, how to solve problems, how to dare to try and make mistakes, how to make decisions," said Christin. "hlstead it has suc­ceeded in regulating students to the point where every student is doing precisely the same thing in the same way." 
If the educational system moves from bureaucracy to a system of trust, Christin feels, the role of the administrator will change greatly. "His major re­sponsibilities will not be the budget or money, but inter­personal relationships -know­ledge of his style and how others perceive it -knowledge of how to work with others so that they are not only concerned with ideas but also with feelings," he stated. 
"No one in an administrative position," he continued, "can succeed unless he opens up and strengthens communications. If you don't provide the informa­tion, then people will provide their own misinformation." 
"It is no longer possible to succeed by edict or decision by a few administrators," he added. 
He also believes that another goal of the educational system of 1980 should be "to get sur­vivalists, people who say, 'I will survive no matter what happens,' involved in living." 
To illustrate his contentions, he related an assignment that he gave to the professors at his college: to formulate their col­lege catalogue for !980 by the 
end of this year. He believes that the "catalogue should be truth­ful -because a truthful one is really hard to find -so you say 
'We have lousy food, but we have a good time!' people will believe you are truthful and that in itself is an accomplishment." 
Projecting on education in the future, Christin predicted that there will be more respect for trades and crafts, moral values will be discussed more, federal and state loans will be given Lo students payable over a 20-30 year period with which students can select the school they want to attend.

The University Arts Council announced yesterday that a Stu­dent Arts Festival for the week of March 7-12 is now in the planning stages. The Festival will hopefully encompass poetry, music, art, photography, and possibly theatre. 
Under the tutelage of Dan 
O'Donnell, Rick Fitzgerald, and Rob Bartoletti, the Festival will take place in the Fieldhouse. About the Fieldhouse O'Donnel commented, "The continued existance of the Fieldhouse as an Arts Center seems reasonably certain." 
O'Donnell feels that the festi­val will center around an art show, but he sees a possibility of adding theatre to it. "The theatre's still up in the air. Our stage is just finished and we are in the process of soliciting people who might have things that could be performed." 
"Last year we had the biggest art show in Notre Dame history and we want to do it again. This

SM C frosh favor co-ed classes 
by Rick Gering 
A survey of St. Mary's Fresh­men drawn up by the SMC Freshman Senate and distributed during the past week, indicates that 96o/r of present SMC frosh would prefer fully co-ed classes. The survey resulted in 41 0 re­sponses from SMC's 500 fresh­men. 
The study showed that 86% of those questioned would leave SM:C if Notre Dame decided to proceed with co-education with­out St. Mary's; 99.5% would continue at SMC if it went co-ed along with Notre Dame; and that 99% of their parents would ap­prove of the girls' attending such an institution. 
Regarding co-ed classes, 93% report finding male/female classes more intellectually stimu­lating than all female classes, and only 8% are bothered with the prospect of having to go to ND for their courses. 
A majority of present Fresh­men (74%) said they anticipated a possible merger with Notre Dame when they applied to SMC, and 84% were more im­pP~ssed with "the benefits of­fered by ND" than with "SMC's

"Right now", O'Donnell con­tinued, "We're particularly con­cerned with drawing as many people as possible into this. We need people for manual help, for art, poetry, theatre especially, and for a photo exhibit." ·

If everyone, as William Ruckelshaus suggested last night, is a polluter, and if society is indeed the wrongdoer, as Mr. Ruckelshaus suggested, then it is past time for everyone to get on society's collective back and make them do right. 
The realization that society must make, and which the Nixon administration is slowly making, is that massive Federal control -and only massive Federal control -of major industrial polluters will in anyway offer any kind of an alternative to our present ominous state. Mr. Ruckelshaus, who' serves as head of the Environmental Protection Agency, went as far to admit that competition for industry effectively immobilizes antipollution efforts within states. It becomes apparent, then, that the Federal Government must both legislate and enforce tough antipollution laws --if there is to he any attempt to stop pollution at all. 
But Ruckelshaus is right, too, when he says that the impetus for such strict Federal laws must come from "the people." "The people" must be satisfied with more than ambiguous terms such as the "imminent and substantial danger to public health" clause of the interstate air pollution law presently in effect. "The people" must be willing to act in a concerted and coordinated way; and they must show an intelligent concern towards the pollution problem. 
But more than that; the people of this country must realize the cost of pollution control in dollars and cents, and must be willing to pay that cost. We must be willing to bear the necessary and inevitable rise in price that will accompany each industrial effort at self-regulation; they must be willing to bear the necessary added tax any enforcement will engender. Moreover, we must be eager to trade money for an end to pollution; because that's the only trade we're going to get, and the trade will be on the market for a limited time only. 
Gene Molinelli ----------------------------­-------Some Reflections on Mardi Gras 
Mardi Gras --a carnival --a time of wild abandon --a festival of sounds, sights and smells --a joyful tingling of the senses. Here at Notre Dame, Folks, and it's all yours to enjoy. Step right up and have fun, Folks; yep, step right up and experience the Time Of Your Life! 
It was all there all right: the booths painted gaily with bright colors; the booths imaginatively designed and staffed by broadly smiling people; the dim lighting conveying· the ambiguous moods ot dusk; the bright flashing lights reminiscent of a big city's theater and entertainment district; the loud music commanding the attention and hypnotizing the attentive; the mobs of people talking, sweat­ing, laughing, crying, winning, walking, losing, standing, playing ... it was all there. 
All the excitement; it was there. T.h.e anticipa­tion of great things hung from the ceiling, flowed from the stage and, womehow, filled the air -·­magically, electricly, animating all that it touched. Faces flaoted by flashing mechanical smiles and jerkily moving through the pulsating atmosphere, forced to motion by something beyond their control, by some pervading presence, by the spirit of the Mardi Gras. And the hopes of fabulous winnings and endless conquests --the virgin black-jack counters waiting to be broken; the unescourted girls ready to be swept away --they were there. And they were there and they were there and, hours later, they were still there. 
Something was missing. The hours of unparal­
were oppressive. Mardi Gras was disappointing. It was depressing. All its pomp was empty. It was a vain struggle for a shallow enjoyment. It was an attempt by a bored and restless tudent body to squeeze a few drops of pleasure out of a cold and confining 
season of the year. It was an effort to forget, to be lost in the anomnity of the crowd and loudness of the noise so that other things could not disturb the 
mind-so that the most pressing problem was how to deal with a thirteen, or whether or not that girl had a guy around someplace. It was shallow and pointless-the hopes were unfulfilled, the projected pictures were out of place, the smiles were false, the people were blind, deaf and dumb. It was all a melting dream; it was intangible; it was unreal. 
But were there no good times? Yes, the good times were there too. The good times--the half hour or so when nothing could go wrong-when every card that was not a ten was an ace; when every face was all smiles; when every girl was beautiful and friendly; when every sound was music and 
every friend a close friend; when all the world was 
happy and all mankind was united and together and with it. And those are the times that make it all worthwhile. From the good times come the memories--the reasons for coming back the next year--and the next-the reasons for attempting, once again. to find happine_ss, at Jeast temporarily,

-----View With No Room 
Ever since the University of Notce Dame instituted its stay-hall policy three years ago there has been an annual panic l]eginning on or about February I and lasting until the end of room selection. The question of concern used to be: "Will I get a good room?" This year, however, it has changed to: "will I get a room at all?" 
This could and should have been anticipated. In September of 1969 and again in 1970 each hall was required to reserve 33% of its beds for incoming freshmen. Last year 33% was too many for some halls to handle. People who had resided in the hall for a year and in some cases more than a year were required to find other accomoda­tiuns (usually off-campus). This year simple mathematics makes it plainly evident thal reserving another 33% of the beds for incoming freshmen is going to create a monstrous problem. 
Fr. Chambers and the Office of Student Residency are not wholly at fanlt. They are aware that the halls will be overcrowded next year but as Fr. Chambers said yesterday, "It's a problem we have inherited." 
The root of the problem is the Office of Admissions. Each year they accept 3000 freshmen, hoping that a total of around 1600 dechle to attend. Obviously they have no way of knowing the exact amount of high shcool seniors that will finally choose Notre Dame, nevertheless they guarantee each one of them a bed on campus. Last year the Office of Admissions underestimated by over I 00. There were freshmen (healthy ones) living in the infirmary for the first three weeks. I guess those are beds on campus. This year the 
problem could be worse. Why are the residence halls so crowded? Simply because off-{;am­pus living is becoming less and less attractive. All of its previous adv~ntage~ (cars, unlimited visitation, etc.) are for the most part aVailable 111 th~ halls. Fr. Chambers is counting on a number of present Sophomores, Juniors and even Freshmen to move off-cam­pus. The hard fact is that the great majority of these people prefer the Halls. The problem then presents itself as: Where do we put the 
incoming Freshmen'~ However this is exactly the wrong way of lookmg at the questiOn. Rather, dump the problem hack upon the Office of Admissions and let them decide where to put the 
F_reshmen. This could be implimented by simply ignoring the quota given to each hall by Father Cham hers' office. The halls should then hold their own room selection, in w'latever manner they choose, and only then inform Fr. Chambers of how many beds remain. These beds will ht: apportioned to incoming Freshmen. 
I see this as the only policy consistent with this University's committment as a Christian institution. If each hall is to have a Community spirit (especially one like mine with onfy 136 residents) why should it be forced to expel one of its known and respected members, who drew a bad lottery number or whose GPA is low in 
favor of someincoming Freshman, sight unseen'? ' The fact is they shouldn't. This is why the Office of Student Residency leaves the decision of who to kick out up to the halts. However the lime has come for the halls to refuse to comply with University polip.y. A single hall is powerless (history has proven this) but this year a good portion of the halls will face the problem Therefore, I propose that the HPC should treat this as an issue of common concern ans unite in refusal if no alternate and acceptable

Emil T. HoHman: profile of a scientist 

The night before the final exam, 800 freshmen buried their chemistry books in a large grave, marking the spot with a cross-shaped parking sign reading "Emil 
T. Hofman." 

That was several years ago, but Dr. Emil T. Hofman, professor of chemistry at the University of Notre Dame, still chuckles as he remembers telling the student just before the exam that their 
situation develops a sense of self-reliance and peer group cooperation generally absent in smaller classes. "The student's educational experience should be varied," He stressed. "Students should at some time have the experience of a large class lecture course but it would be a very poor experience if they were to have only large class courses," he added. 
He particularly wants to learn the techniques of animation, so that he can prepare films of molecules reacting and other non-photographable phenomena. He looks forward to the day when he can produce the more versatile 16-millimeter films and purchase a color television video-tape set to present in-class labora­tory experiments. Black-and-white, he ex­plains, can't show the distinct blue <;olor of hydrated copper sulfate, or the pink of a manganese solution. 
A talented chef ·and veteran traveler, Hofman also visits student dormitories as an invited speaker, defending the honor code and stressing student responsibility in education. Such visits, he explains, are one more indication to students that the professor is genuinely concerned, even if denied the dose, personal contact of smaller classes. 
Manv of his students and their parents genuinely appreciate the single-minded, concerted effort he makes to present a superior chemistry class. An administra­tive officer at the National Cancer Insti­tute wrote Hofman praising the help sessions that nurtured his interest in science, and noted "you were as con­cerned about students with little scien­
tific  aptitude  as  you  were  about  the  
better students."  
Parents  write  thanking  him  for  en­ 

couraging their sons, or for taking the time to address dormitory discussions and student-parent gatherings. Teachers on the sophomore to senior level place impli­cit faith in the thoroughness of his COltrse, telling students in organic chemis­try "you had this in Dr. Hofman's class." 
There are some students who are not so enthusiastic about Hofman and his chemistry class. One commented that "Emil T ." could be elected the most popular and the second most unpopular professor in any given year. Another student recalls a classmate who nudged his arm every Wednesday as quizzes were returned, muttering "he's evil, he's evil." 
Most students, however, have admired the chemistry professor's even -handed aid, dispensed equally to the bright and to the average. 
Using an 8-millimeter camera, he and his students have produced lab films to accompany student experiments. as well as demonstration films, such as how to make a cloud chamber, to illustrate prin­ciples in the lectures. The films cost a small fraction~f purchased material, Hof­man explained, and are perfectly suited to his own course material. 
A black-and-white video-tape recorder is. used to prepare lectures on background material, allowing students to brush up on high school chemistry or math at their convenience. The television is used to replace Hofman's lectures only in emer­gency situations, since he feels strongly that there is more to teaching than presenting information, even in the largest lecture. "Only the face-to-face presence of the professor can provide the motivation and inspiration -the intangi­bles of education," Hofman said. 
Other learning aids include tape­
·recorded, step-by-step solutions to the homework problems assigned in class. Students can take copies of the tape to their dormitory study lounges and work closely with each other on the problems, using the tape as a guide or check. Hofman also arranges workshops in which graduate students provide full tutoring for the freshmen everyafternoon and he personally appears for an early morning question period on Thursday to prepare students for the Friday quiz. 
The help programs are part of Hof­man's philosophy that the University has a responsibility to any student it accepts --a responsibility to offer him every opportunity to succeed. The failure rate in his course is extremely low -usually less than five per cent. William M. Burke, dean of the freshman year program, pointed out that no student failing chem­istry has ever blamed Hofman, but has accepted the blame himself for not taking advantage of the help available. 
Perhaps the most pervasive teaching tool, however, is the famed and notorious Friday quiz. Thursday night is tradi­tionally "Emil T" night in the dormitory, with half the population of many dorms studying furiously for the 20-minute quiz. Some students complain the quizzes are ambiguous, but others explain that they are simply not rote memory tests. ''I'm not impressed with recall," Hofman explained. It's not a question of knowing, its a matter of working with what you 
know." The quiz helps the student learn to work under pressure, to· apply the theories and principles absorbed in class to a specific problem situation. The quiz also exemplifies Hofman's philosophy of education, with its objective that students learn, not that teachers teach. The short 

Notre Dame football players have been challenged by the Saint Mary's College cheerleaders to the first International Broom ball Championship. Misses, Terri Buck, Ann Stringer, Molly Tiernan and others will battle the strongmen with brooms and volley-ball during the intermission of the Ice Capades a week from toda~'. During the pre-game practice, no injuries were reported. The Ice Capades, whic:l b.:gin next Wednesday night, feature championship skaters and precision skating. The average age of the skaters is 20, and auditions for people interested in joi;;i:;g !he Ice Capades will be held next week. Rising starlet Terri Buck will appear in the finale of the Ice Capades next Friday evening. 
quiz frequently teaches what the lectures can not. 
Hofman is currently working to ex­pand his technological hands -the films, tapes and television equipment that allow him to offer such wide services to so many students. He believes strongly that large lectures are here to stay, and that they need not be as harmful as is gener­ally believed. In fact, he notes that information courses can be taught quite effectively with the aid of educational technology, and that the large lecture grades would be ready in three days, reminding them of the biblical quotation "He shall rise in all his power and glory in three days." 
The burial exemplifies an affection­dread relationship that has existed be­tween Hofman and his freshmen chemis­try students for over IS years. The upperclassmen enjoy telling the freshmen how tough I am," he smiled. "It's like an initiation ceremony." Over 13,000 stu­dents learned their freshman chemistry from the deep-voiced, rotund lecturer, spreading the fame of his Friday quizzes and home movies, and telling stories true and invented. 
"Emil T," as he is affectionately known by the 800 freshmen he teaches energy to improving Chemistry I 5 and 16, patiently polishing the notes for his planned textbook, and constantly devis­ing new technological hands to widen his services to the students. 
each  semester,  describes  himself  as  a  
living  exception  to  the  "publish  or

His efforts have been appreciated and rewarded by his students and superiors alike. He won Notre Dame's first Thomas 
J. Madden award for Excellence in the Teaching of Freshmen, and is consistently voted the best teacher by freshmen each year. The University has recognized his success by frequent promotions, includ­ing naming him assistant dean of the College of Science. 
Recently, Hofman taught himself to make laboratory and demonstration films to supplement his lectures. "Science teachers have always known that watch­ing a demonstration is a significant aid to understanding chemistry," he explained, "but only through films is this possible in a lecture-class of 400 students." Hofman added that commercially-produced films are often expensive and of poor educa­tional quality, principally because most chemists can't make films and most film­makers don't understand chemistry.

Senate Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield called the vote ·~ust a preliminary" and added

Senate reformers backing the rules change agreed with Mansfield. They predicted the resolution would pick up more votes on the first ballot than in other years but still would fall short of two thirds approval. 
The reformers are banking on gaining additional strength in later votes. 
Assistant Senate Democratic leader Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia indicated that he was in this group when he told reporters he would vote for cloture when both sides had had ample time to debate. Another pickup and a signer of the cloture petition was Senator Daniel K. Inouye, D.-Hawaii, who has never previously voted for cloture. 
Senator Edmund S. Muskie, D.-Maine, urged President Nixon to "publicly and forcefully back the efforts of those who are attempting to modernize the senate procedures."

Wildcats maul Irish, 99-81 



The Irish Eye 
l=======<================~:-.o;:::=======================================================::::: To Err Is Human 
(NOTE: This column was written before last night's game against 
Villanova. It is not meant to be a ''lump on the band wagon" article. Nor is it a defensive column. It is simply an attempt to be objective over the controversy about basketball coach John Dee.) 
A Notre Dame basketball practice isn't much different than most college team practices, at least in the format. It lasts about two hours and the players all work hard especially against the freshman. This is when frosh coach Tom O'Conner uses his scouting reports and has his first year men simulate the offense or defense of the Irish next opponent against the varsity. 
At" the same time, assistant coach Gene Sullivan is pacing up and down the court, barking out orders, reminding different men of their particular responsibilities against the next opponent and seemingly running the practice. 
Over at the scorers table sits head coach Johnny Dee. He doesn't really say that much to the -team. He just watches. Every once in a while something occurs that pleases of displeases him more than other things and then he'll make audible his thoughts. For the most part, however, he sits calmly and watches practice run its wurse. 
Often, at the end of practice, he assembles the players before they make their way to the showers and talks to them. An observer sitting back in the stands doesn't know what he is saying but when he finishes somebody like Austin Carr or Doug Gemmell claps his hands or smacks a teammate on the seat of his pants and the squad walks or trots to the lockers. 
It doesn't seem like the head coach has really done much at all in practice. 
Now change the scene. It's Chicago Stadium, January 30th of this year. Notre Dame is playing Illinois and it is obviously not the best night of the season for the Irish. At each timeout it appears from courtside that Sullivan and not Dee is doing all of the talking as the team huddles around the bench. The Irish go on to Jose this game and the majority of the student body is miffed at the performance of their team. The brunt of the blame is placed where blame is usually put, on the coach. 
When this reporter gave an account of that particular game he mentioned a number of questions and charges that seemed a concensus opinion of the students at that game. One of the team members pointed out a flaw in this type of reporting. These questions shouldn't have been asked unless the coach himself was contacted to give answers. It was poor journalism. 
Following this game a number of letters were submitted to The Observer Sports Department, most of these were critical of coach Dee. The arguments made sense but perhaps they aren't written with a fair version of what is act~ally going on. 
Let's look at the situation objectively. Many students have voiced the opinion that they think Dee is "one of the worst coaches in the college game." This is ridiculous. No one can win twenty games three years in a row against the type of competition that ND plays and be classed in that category. 
This does not mean to say that the friendly Irishmen should be high in the balloting for Coach of the Year each season either. Still his record is impressive and, although the talent he coaches is considerable, it is not conceded by anyone to be altogether superior over other teams in the nation. 
Possibly the success of the Irish football team has spoiled the student body. Each week they watch Ara's boys come out and dismantle an opponent. Possibly one or two Saturdays during the fall the Irish make a few mistakes and the team ends up 8-2 or 9-1 but they rank among the Top Ten. No one ever dares mention that Ara Parseghian should be fired. This is just. 
Consider Dee's situation, however. He must get his team ready for more than one game a week and the competition is obviously the best in the country. If you figure that the basketball squad plays two and a half times as many games as their pigskin counterparts then they are entitled to at least five losses and can still be held in the same respect as Ara & Co. 
Following this simple logic one can conclude that.Johnny Dee is doing a job nearly comparable to Ara Parseghian. This writer, for one, doesn't want to see Ara c~mned in the next few decades. Maybe we can also give Johnny some benefit of the doubt. 
The statement is not being made that Johnny Dee is the master strategist of a Johnny Wooden mold nor is he the technician that Frank McGuire is. He doesn't teach defense like AI McGuire and he cannot concoct a crafty "Kentucky trap zone" like the ol' Baron, Adolph Rupp_ But Johnny Dee does have something going for him. To his players he is not merely a coach. Each man on the team respects him and feels close to him. 
Perhaps Dee's greatest attribute is the same thing that causes him to make some coaching errors, that is, he is human. The team realizes this, maybe the student body would do well to acknowledge this also. It wasn't strategy or a special defense that beat UCLA, it was a team that wanted to win one for their coach in the worst way. 
By this point in the season it is obvious what type of team ND 
has. It is one that is capable of being the best in the nation on a 
certain afternoon but at times it is simply human. 
Why, even Austin Carr has shown signs of being mortal. Let's just accept the team as they are, it's not always the coaches fault when the ball is thrown away or a shot is missed. It's all part of being human!

Villanova's Howard Porter and Hank Siemiontkowski com­bined for 64 points, 41 of them in the first half, while leaping the Wildcats to a 99-81 romp past Notre Dame in the Penn Palestra last night before an SRO crowd of 9200. 
The Wildcats were in control of the game all the way, out-shooting and outrebounding the Irish from the outset. Notre Dame couldn't seem to do any­thing right, shooting poorly, fail­ing to hit the boards, and making turnovers. Villanova opened up an early lead and the Irish never made a contest out of 
it. 
Sid Catlett got the game's first bucket on a tip-in and Austin Carr chipped in a free throw to get the Irish out front 3-0 at the 
start but that was the biggest 
advantage Notre Dame was to 
have in the game. 
Siemiontkowski converted a 
pair of offensive rebounds into 
buckets to put the Wildcats on 

top 4-3 but a hoop by John 
Pleick gave Notre Dame their 
last lead of the night, 5-4. 
Howard Porter, the Wildcats' 
6'8" All-American, put 
Villanova ahead to stay 6-S, 
dropping in a bucket after haul­ing down an offensive rebound. 

Leading 13-10, 'Nova went on a 9-2 tear to move in front by ten, 22-12. Porter had two baskets in the surge, Siemiontkowski and Clarence Smith added one bucket each and Tom Ingelsby tossed in a free throw. 
Collis Jones then made a three point play to close the gap to seven, but the 'Cats went on another spree, outscoring the Irish 10-2, to build up a 32-16 lead. Porter and Siemiontkowski each had a pair of hoops and Chris Ford contributed two free throws in the Blitz. After that hot streak, it was all over but the shouting. 
Villanova built up a 20 point 

lead with seven minutes left in the first half, 38-18, and held a 21 point advantage at intermis­sion, 54-33. 
The Wildcats dominated the second half of play, as they did the first, and the Irish never threatened. 'Nova opened up a 26 point lead, 73-47, their widest margin of the game, with about 12 minute.~ to go in the half and coasted to the final 99-81 spread. 
The Irish employed a pressing defenseforthefinall8minutes of the game but it did little to 
· hamper the 'Cats. 
Porter paced the Villanova attack with 35 points while Siemiontkowski, a 6'6" junion, added 29. Chris Ford also scored in double figures for 'Nova, contributing 14 points. 
Austin Carr, as usual, was high man for the Irish, tossing in 35 points. Collis Jones, limited to just three points in the first half, got hot in the second stanza and finished up with 20 markers. Sid Catlett also finished in double figures, chipping in 10 points. 
Villanova is now 18-5 on the season while Johnny Dee's charges are I 2-6. 
The Irish will now have to win all of their remaining eight games if they are to reach the 20-win plateau. Another loss or two could also endanger the Irish hopes for an NCAA bid. 
Last night's drubbing will undoubtedly knock the Irish out of their ranking in the top ten. Villanova, ranked l£ th this week, should move up in the polls. 
Notre Dame hopefully will start the win streak that will carry them into the NCAA tourney tomorrow afternoon in Chicago as they oppose the DePaul Demons. Game time is I :30 EST.

Four players with connections with Indiana were listed among the top l 0 scorers.

Willie Humes of Idaho State, a former high school star at Madi­son, Ind., remained in third place, increasing his average from 31.7 points per game to 32.9. 
George McGinnis of Indiana was tied for fourth place with

urday while the matmen face Findlay Friday and Cincinnati Saturday. The fencing team tan­gles with Detroit, the University of Chicago and M.l.T. in Chicago Saturday. 
Track coach Alex Wilson will enter three relay teams and nu­merous individuals in the 
Michigan State Relays. The mile relay foursome of Don Greehan, Rick Wohlhuter and Mike and Tom McMannon figures to place high along with Wohlhuter in the 600, Elio Pol­sell in the shot put, Mike McMannon in the long and triple jumps and hurdlers Joe Utz and Tom McMannon. 
Wohlhuter captured the NCAA 600 indoor title last year and Wilson says the senior cap­tain is already in excellent shape this year. Polselli set a new school mark in the shot put last week with a 5 6-9 % effort. A total of _19 events are scheduled with 600 athletes from 24 uni­versities entered. 
The Irish swimmers, now 4 ~4, received double victories from sophomores John Sherk (500-1 ,000 freestyle) and Gene Krathaus (50-1 00 freestyle) in a 73~40 loss to Western Michigan last week. But Coach Dennis Stark was pleased with the over­all team balance as 11 indivi­duals posted their best times of 
the season. 

Notre Dame's wrestling team is now 5~6~1 after losing a triple dual at home Saturday but 1.eavyweight Phil Gustafson is still undefeated with a perfect ll ~0 record. Cincinnati handed the Irish a 23~11 loss in the triple dual.

Notre Dame, now 9~11~1 overall and 5~9~1 against WCHA teams, will be meeting Terry Shercliff's Bulldogs for the first time. Faceoff each night is 8 P.M., C.S.T. 
While Notre Dame was losing (4~3) and then winning (4~2) against Denver ~ thanks to the first ND "hat trick" of the sea­son by freshman Ian Williams on Saturday ~ Duluth was gaining a split at home with Michigan State. Duluth lost on Friday, 5~4, but bounced back for an 8~4 success Saturday, scoring three goals in the final seven minutes. 
The game will be a home­coming for junior Kevin Hoene, Notre Dame's No. 2 center. The Duluth native has recorded five " goals and nine assists and Smith has been pleased with his play recently. "Kevin has good speed ~ he's been our unsung hero throughout the season," rea­soned Smith, who switched Hoene back to center after in­juries curtailed the play of Phil Wittliff and Paul Regan. 
Smith was pleased with the play against Denver. "Our kids are staying up at the blue line and meeting the play and our forwards did an outstanding job of forechecking," measured Smith. 
Williams and No. 1 center John Noble, with 12 and 11 goals respectively, were inserted on the same line in recent games and have accounted for a total of 58 points. 
The Irish also received a tre­mendous effort from goalie Dick Tomasoni on Saturday. Toma­soni recorded 20 saves alone in the third period and prompted Smith to remark: "I planned to alternate our goalies the rest of ~ the season, but now I have that same old confident feeling about Tomasoni." 
Duluth, now 13~11 ove(all and 9~9 in the WCHA, is an­chored by Walt Ledingham with I 7 goals and 24 assists. ""
