Law Chair to be temporary or permanent? 
by Mike Baum The Notre Dame Law School is presently discussing with the Administration the feasability of awarding one of their newly endowed Chairs on a temporary basis, rather than making it a permanent assignment. Endowed Chairs, usually financed by private in­dividuals of corporations, are one of the best methods for a University to enlarge it's teaching faculty. The University has at present six, almost seven of these Chairs, the last five being the result of contributions from the Summa campaign, and are not yet officially filled. University President Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C., noted at the announcement of these chairs that "the establishment of these chairs is a significant way of underwriting continuing academic distinction at Notre Dame. Named professorships enable the University to honor outstanding scholarship among its own teachers and to attract scholars of the first rank to the University." The Law School has two new Chairs, only one of which, the White Chair, can be considered fully funded. A result of the Summa drive and the recent Law School fund-raising campaign, the Chair represents a $500,000 gift from Mr. and Mrs. Thomas J. White.The other, the Kenneth Redman Chair, is presently being funded on year to year contributions. The Law School, according to Dean Thomas Shaffer, would like the White Chair opened for tem­porary appointments, such as Visiting Professorships, instead of being restricted to permanent appointments.

The difference, according to Dean Shaffer, is the amount of freedom in awarding these Chairs. "We feel," he said, "that it will give us exposure to a wider array of people." Those teachers, for example, that don't want to be tied to a University for some con­siderable length of time could be hired. It requires of a teacher a "less drastic committment," in Dean Shaffer's words. 
In addition, it allows the school a margin of safety in the hiring of professors. The fact that a man is prominent in the field of law does not neccessarily guarentee that he will be a good teacher, as Dean 
I 
Shaffer pointed out, the surest judgment of teaching ability is based on performance. A temporary Chair requires a less drastic commitment on the part of the Law School also. 
The problem is the matter has two causes. First, named or endowed chairs are customarily permanent positions. The College of Business Administration recently faced the same question in searching for a man to take the C.R. Smith Chair of Business Ad­ministration. This Chair will be awarded permanently. 
Dean Thomas Murphy of the Business College ad­mits that there was "some discussion" on opening the Chair to temporary appointments, and that "some of the faculty" were in favor of it. However, endowed Chairs are awarded permanently "by tradition in American education," according to Murphy. 
The second obstruction, and the baSis for the discussion between the Law School and the Provost's office, is a document which Dean Shaffer refers to as "the Board of Trustees Regulations on Endowed Chairs", which have not been released to the public. 
According to Shaffer , these regulations "im­plicitly" require the Chairs to be permanent awards. 
Fr. Burtchaell agreed with this. The regulations do not allow temporarily-awarded chairs, he said. He pointed out, however, that this does not preclude the possibility of exceptions. Burtchaell also noted that they were "very far" from a decision on the point. 
The eventual decision will certainly have some effect on the other three Summa Chairs, in Chemistry, Philosophy, and Electrical Engineering.

(c) 1972 New_ York Times Washington, March 9-President Nixon today ordered all airlines to adopt new security measures immediately to prevent the sabotage of American commercial aircraft. -. In a strongly worded statement which followed an explosion this week aboard one commercial aircraft and the discovery of explosive devices on two others, Nixon ordered into effect new security regulations published two days ago in 
the federal register that, under normal cir­cumstances, would not have been implemented for 90 days. 
Recalling his efforts in 1970 to curtail hijacking, he said: 
"Our air transportation system faces a new threat in the form of vicious extortion plots like the ones which have been directed at air traffic across the country this week. We must not be intimidated by such lawlessness. Rather we must and will meet this blackmail on the ground, as vigorously as we have met piracy in the air." 
Nixon also disclosed that he had ordered John Volpe, the Secretary of Trasportation, to sum­mon "leaders of the aviation community" to discuss ways to implement the regulations. The executives of nearly 30 airlines are expected to meet with the secretary tomorrow morning. 
As sketched in general terms by the President, the regulations direct every air carrier to prevent or deter "carriage of weapons or ex­plosives" aboard aircraft; to prevent or deter "unauthorized access" to aircraft; to tighten baggage checking procedures; and to improve the security of cargo and baggage-loading operations. 
Officials said tonight that the federal aviation administration, which drew up the new regulations, has also devised a specific set of procedures which it is prepared to recommend to the airlines. These are said to include more electronic surveillance, more frequent baggage checks, and even personal inspection of in­dividual passengers. 
They conceded that some new manpower and equipment might be required, and said the costs "Nould be borne by the carriers. 
Gen. Benjamin Davis, an assistant secretary of transportation who briefed newsmen this afternoon, said the antihijacking program curretnly in effect involves a rapid screening process under which potential hijackers are identified on the basis of a complex four-part "profile" separated from other passengers, and detained. He said the same profile would apply to extortionists. 

., However, he conceded, not all airlines had vigorously followed the hijacking procedures, and that in any case the antihijacking program was aimed largely at passengers. Any new program to deter extortionists, he suggested, would have to involve more careful surveillance of baggage and airline employees-maintenance personnel for example. 
Nixon also said he had directed the depart­ment of transportation to invoke new security regulations governing airport operators, in addition to the carriers. The effect of these regulations, he said, would be to segregate the public rigidly from operating areas at airports, thereby creating a "security envelope" around the aircraft and its "supporting systems and personnel."

Observer Insight 

Students nix new schedule 
by Stan Podlasek 
Students polled last night in a random survey voiced 
II :2 opposition to Notre Dame's schedule next semester. The question asked of residents in fourteen halls was:Are you in favor of the planned schedule change for next semester? 

Yes  13  14.4 per cent  
No  71  79.0 per cent  
Undecided  :1  3.3 per cent  
Indifferent  3  3.3 per cent  

Heasons given for opposition were threefold: 1) The early beginning would cause a conflict with summer jobs: 2) The one week vacations would not benifit student's whose distance from school made travel too expensive and time-consuming; and 3) Christmas vacation remained too long. 
"I can make $125.00 in one week, if late registration only costs $25.00, I'm going to come a week late." "I don't want to go to school on labor day." 
Many who recalled the scortching days of August regarded the weather as a major concern. However, it is not a matt~r of convenience in many cases. From the students voicing a "no" answer the early com­mencement of classes was the largest cause of disappointment. 
"I need the money; many companies won't hire people that can't work the entire summer, and jobs are hard enough to find." 
For students who remain here for Thanksgiving, the increase of a few days will make no difference. 
"It costs me $80.00 round trip to New Jersey. I can't afford to pay that much." "What good are three-day weekends? Two day weekends are dull enough here." "What can you do in three days; I'd rather have them lumped together." 

~-St~d~~ts who didn't like the plan suggested that 
Christmas vacation be made still shorter rather than 
opening the. school year earlier. 
"lwouidn't mind clipping a couple of days off at Christmas if we didn't have to come back so early." 
The greatest support for the change was in the midwest where opposition ran only five to two. Other parts of the country, including all of the foreign students polled, heavily opposed the plan. Many students revealed that they had already signed a petition expressing their disapproval. Most were skeptical, however, of the ability to chang the UAC's decision. 
"I would like to see the schedule changed, but I don't know how much ofa chance there is ofthat." "I doubt they're going to reverse their decision." 
Upper-classmen agreed that there was a need for a semester break, but said that free time should not be supplemented by adding days in August. 
"It will disrupt everyone's summer plans. Many people take vacations in the last weeks of August; others count on an extra week's wages." 
There seems to be a great undercurrent of student empathy. People who stated openly that the new schedule would be to their advantage didn't hesitate to add that they didn't feel it was "fair to everyone in­volved." 
"I hope the University will reconsider." 

Some students resented the votes cast in favor of the new schedule by the seven student members of the liAC. "Why wasn't the student body consulted about the change? many ask. In view of the fact that the change was introduced to the HPC as early as February first, it is clear that the new schedule was not made as well-known as it could have been. 
What will happen now is uncertain. Not all the students agreed about the entire schedule, but 80 per cent confirm that their opinions should have been considered more seriously. The students are not asking that the entire new schedule be scrapped, but they are 
asking for more awareness of their personal needs.

Calendar protestr 2400 sign petition within two hours 
by Mary Romer 
Within two hours last night, 2400 students signed a petition to change the new academic calendar for next year. The new schedule, as approved by the Academic Council three days ago, calls for the opening of school on August 31, an eight day Thanksgiving break and a three day weekend October 14-16. 
Prompted by popular disap­pointment with the new schedule Badin Hall freshman Mike Davis drew up the petition. Davis said they hoped to get more names later last night by canvassing the halls, the library and the Huddle. It was circulated in the dining halls also last night. 
The petition will be presented to Rev. James Burtchaell, C.S.C., University Provost. 
The main objection to the calendar is the reduction of time for summer jobs and the Christmas vacation. The cutback on working time could mean as much as a $300 loss in some cases. 
Any student wishing to help with the petitioning can contact Mike Davis at 6938. The petitioning will be continued in the dining halls tomorrow night.

Commencement plans 
announced by Pilleretti 
Senior Class President Tom Pifferetti announced yesterday that plans for the 1972 Com­mencement Exercises in May are already in the planning stages and that all plans for housing accomodations for parents and guests on campus have been taken care of. 
"Housing for parents will remain basically the same as last year," Pifferetti said, "parents will be housed in various dorms on campus for a very nominal price per night." 
Senior parents will be sent a packet of information in about two weeks which will includ" an application form enabling them to request any one of a series of dorms and the number of rooms they will need. A letter of ex­planation and a tentativeschedule of events for the weekend will also be enclosed in the packet. Seniors will be sent a copy of the letter. 
"There is no limit to the number of guests permitted," Pifferetti stated. "but Seniors ar_e

asked to keep the number reasonable." 
In order for all the forms to be sent out properly, and to facilitate further Com­mencement plans, seniors are urged to check their name and room number for any discrepancies ~n the computer lists which will be posted in the lobbies of each hall throughout next week, and to make any necessary corrections. 
As far as the graduation ceremonies themselves are concerned, Pifferetti confirmed that the University is hoping to change the ceremonies, "perhaps to make them less formal and more personal." Class representatives have been asked to sit on the planning committee. 
Pifferetti said that anyone who would like to contribute ideas or has any questions concerning housing or the Commencement weekend can contact him at 234­8234 or leave a message in the Student Government offices.

Nixon's campaign builds 
OF AGE 

(c) l!li2 New York Times 
Washington, March 9 President Nixon's Political operatives are clearly using the early presidential primaries as training grounds for next fall's nationwide election, and there is no better illustration of this than their activities in Florida. 
The Committee to re-{!lect the President -the hub of the Nixon operation with headquarters across the street from the White House on Pennsylvania Ave. -is, of course, anxious to make the best possible showing in these early contests. The Committee was pleased with the New Hampshire results and hopes to do even better next Tuesday, in Florida, where representatives Paul McCloskey and John Ash­brook are again on the ballot opposing the President. 
But to anyone who has traveled to the primary states it is plain that the Committee's efforts to get out the vote now are also aimed at improving its capacities and techniques next November. 
To take one small illustration: the only mass mailing so far in Florida -a letter to about half the State's 800,000 registered · Republicans -contained not only

Davi~s: Nixon's good-will. trip amends 1944 policy mistakes 
by Don Hopfer 
Calling President Nixon's recent to China "one of recon­ciliation, an attempt to repair damage done", John Paton Davies, noted author and former member of the State Depart­ment's Foreign Service, lectured last night in the Library Auditorium on "China and the United States: The Balance of Power." 
"We would not have become enemies if, in 1944, we would have had a different policy". Davies felt that our backing of the Chinese Nationalists under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek caused the Communists to seek support from the only other available source-Moscow. 
While Davies was a member of the American consulate in China during the war, he had a chance to deal with the present premier of China, Chou en-Lai. He said that everyone who has met Chou, himself included, have been "enormously impressed" by the personal charm of the man. 
He continued that there were only two other men with this common trait of tremendous personal magnetism: noted philosopher Teilhard De Chardin and the late prime minister of India's Jawaharla Nehru. "Of these, De Chardin was the most vibrant, Nehru the softest, and Chou the supplest-sinewy and bending." 
Nixon: Low-key Florida strategy 
a reminder to vote for Nixon on March 14 but an appeal for volunteers to fill vacancies in the party organization at the county and precinct level. 
In addition, several young specialists in direct mail ad­vertising, youth organization, and other areas have been dispatched to Florida from headquarters here to on-the-job training. And when one asks leading Florida Republicans about Nixon's opposition, they do not talk about Ashbrook and McCloskey -the immediate challengers -but about George Corley Wallace, who is perceived as the real threat next fall. 

I 
Davies briefly recounted our relations with the East, dating from the time when the first clipper ships established trade with Japan and China. 
He recalled the time when the Japanese were attempting to expand in the mid-30's: Japan had always looked upon the US as imperialists, and they thought us rather hypocritical for "being so self-righteous" about their own expansions. The bitter feelings that ensued as a result of this culminated in the attack on Pearl Harbor.

Less Chinese support? 
Sato predictsNixon trip consequences 
<c) 1972 New York Times News Service Tokyo, March 8 -Premier Eisaku Sato of Japan predicted in an interview today that communist China would "draw a line" and "voluntarily limit its support of the Vietnamese , Communists, as a consequence of President Nixon's visit to the mainland. Sato did not pretend to have any information on this point, despite the briefing given him at Nixon's request by United States Assistant Secretary of State Marshall Green. But he did express the opinion that the presidential journey to China had been a "great and significant event in history" and also had been "very effective in reducing tensions in Asia." 
Obviously expressing his personal in· terpretation of the new Far Eastern situation. the Premier added: "I expect that new talks on Indochina Peace will start soon and that they will be based on the recent U.S. proposal." 
Apart from his observations on the prospects of Vietnam Peace·-a subject on which Sato admitted he had not been informed in his briefing by Green -Sato said Japan was most anxious to have President Nixon pay this country an official visit. 
Sato said he thought it would be more suitable for Emperor Hirohito, this country's Chief of State, to make an official visit to the United States first; after that, Nixon would come to Japan. 
Sato indicated that such a formula would permit the Emperor to express the gratitude he and his country felt for American aid after World War II. 
The impression given by Sato was that, despite a desire to arrange this exchange swiftly, it might not be possible before 1973 because of the American political campaign. 
The Premier also made the following points: 
-Talks aimed at arranging a formal peace treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union, thus putting an end to World War II as far as those two countries are concerned, will commence before the end of this year. 
-Tokyo would look with favor on a nonagression pact among Russia, China, the United States and Japan-but only if it includes a clause providing for sanctions against any violation of such an agreement. 
-He implied the United States should limit its base facilities in Japan to positions required to help protect this country under the Security Treaty rather than to support any U.S. com­mitments elsewhere in Asia. 
Nevertheless, he stressed that an American Military presence was necessary to ward off Russian threats.

The endowed Chairs 

The establishment of endowed chairs from the money generated by the SUMMA drive marks the University's emergence into a new academic era. Permanently funded professorships are a luxury most universities, especially small private ones, simply cannot afford to any great extent. The creation of five, possibly six, endowed chairs represents (along with the minority scholarship fund) the most significant improvement in the long term academic excellence of Notre Dame to emerge in several years. 
Professor Dennis Dugan of the department of economics estimated that the funds required to support these five professorships range from one and a half million to two million dollars. The exact amount, of course, depends on the salary and growth arrangements of the fund. When one considers that Harvard runs on an endowment in excess of two billion dollars, establishing five permanent seats from ND's meager endowment of $67.9 million is a major accomplishment. 
The Rules For some reason, however, the Board of Trustees has already promulgated regulations governing the appointments to these chairs. These rules are probably an outgrowth of the original SUMMA plan when twenty-five such positions were planned. Now that some appointments are being made, it seems quite arbitrary to strictly follow rules formulated several years ago. Fortunately, the rules are anything but arbitrary. The Provost is allowing Dean Shaffer plenty of latitude in selecting the people to fill his two chairs. In the Law school, especially, this makes sense. If Shaffer is able to persuade someone on the caliber of an ex-Supreme Court Justice or a prominent legislator to ac­cept the law chair, he will undoubtedly add to the University's academic prestige. But, as the dean himself ad­mitted, there is no guarantee that a prominent politician will be able to teach law. Temporary? 
If Shaffer can produce a professor of national acclaim and if the terms of his agreement involve the designation "visiting professor," then there is no reason stifle the academic potential of the endowed chair by unilaterally for­bidding temporary arrangements. Shaffer's appointment is not an ex­ception--how can there be exceptions when there are almost no precedents to establish the rule itself? The only existing named endowed professorship is the Jesse Jones Chair in management. 
There are no precedents now, only 
potential. This potential should be 
developed in a manner that improves the 
academic quality of the University. 
That's the best rule.

The parents and the trustees 

The continuing mass of misinformation 
and confusion about the state of the 
merger may be cleared a little this 
weekend, if the organizers of the soph­
more parents weekend take advantage of 
the St. Mary's Trustees meeting. 

There is no denying that the two groups 
have something to say to each other. The 
parents' concern for the standards of 
education at SMC requires answers from 
the trustees, who have control of the 
education. The department chairmen will 
not have all the answers'!' they are in the 
dark too. The decisions, the knowledge, 
the planning are all contained in the 
Board, and its principal members: Sister 
Alma, Sister Gerald,. and Mother 
Olivette. They have the answers. 

The opportunity is there-and the need is there. The sophmores, perhaps more than any other class, will be affected by the merger or its total breakdown. The decision to transfer or stay presses on the sophmores more than anyone else. The organizers of the Parents Weekend, Maureen Rogers and Jill Hampe, should arrange the meeting -and the Board should meet with the parents.

The thought of school starting in August, and still ending in May, has caused little happiness on the campus. The problems are obvious. When students are forced to rely more and more on their summer earnings to finance college expenses, shortening the summer vacation for an eight-day Thanksgiving break is senseless. 
Students are now circulating a petition asking that the administration or University Academic Council reverse the decision on the Calendar. There is no chance that the calendar will be changed if the petition cannot get any support. It's in the interests of all students to sign the petition. It's our schedule, we should be heard in its formulation.

Although a cool breeze was blowing in off the ocean, the afternoon of 
July 12, 1971 was a hot, dusty time for some twenty-odd young men 
who were kicking, heading, and dribbling a half inflated soccer ball up 
and down a sun parched field in Atlantic City, N.J. 
It was more than just a pick up game; it had to be unless they were 
just plain crazy to want to run around on a field strewn with broken 
glass, and just a little smoother than the frozen mud characteristic of 
the shortcuts to the library. 
These men, all university students who came to the resort from 
overseas for the summer, were showing the world, in their small way, 
that rival factions can coexist under circumstances conducive to 
outbursts of temper and emotion at least. 
The players, and the dozen or so girls along the side lines, were 
natives of Northern Ireland, where at least 15 have been killed and 189 
injured since Jan. 30. 
The game was organized because the students wanted to prove that 
Protestants and Catholics from the Emerald Isle could get together 
without any of the religious and political strife that has brought 
terrorism, colonialism, humiliation, fear, anger, hatred, suffering, 
and death to their home. 
It was also played on this particular day to celebrate the Battle of 
the Boyne, which was fought in 1690. The battle determined that 
William III <William of Orange) of England would rule Ireland. 
William defeated an overthrow attempt by James II, a Protestant who 
had given civil and military power to the Catholics. This power was 
revoked when Queen Elizabeth II forced her Protestant faith upon the 
Irish. 
Since then Ireland has been fighting for its release from the British 
tyranny, and the religious struggle to fill the power vacuum. 
Although the Northern Catholic squad didn't have the cheerleading support the Protestant southern team had, it dominated the game scoring four goals in the first half, and two more in the second while holding the opposition scoreless. 
But the score really didn't matter. No one offered excuses of dirty play by the North, or tried to embarrass the Southwith ridicule of their soccer prowess. No one made any hint that those of one faith were inherently superior to the other. 
As if this wasn't enough to rekindle some of the hope that sanity remains in the world, handshakes and congratulations were in order, and the captains of both teams shared an ice cream bar, supplied by the local good humor man who recognized an international market ready for the probing claws of American capitalism. 
Change this entire scene to Drogheda, Northern Ireland, where the River Boyne empties into the Irish Sea, and you would have a game interrupted by British paratroopers with itchy trigger fingers; gelignite filled nail bombs; and completed with a tar and feathering of the losers. 
Like other atrocities in the deranged world, we have followed the fighting Irish for some time as it popped in and out of the news, and now as they consistently grab banner headlines while intensifying, without taking any sort of position for or against the British oc­cunation. 
This campus has become blase since Spring '70, at least as far as such issues as Northern Ireland go. Anyone who wants to refute this statement can check the per capita donation to the Pakistan Relief f<'und. It was less than 20 cents. No one asked you for the type of donation Notre Dame seeks from its alumni, or to save the world, just to sacrifice a trip to food sales or maybe a six pack. Is it too much to ask for such a stand, or to spend an hour or two marching and petitioning for a cause? 
Now thanks to graduate student Denise Askin, the campus has another chance to show some moral backbone through the Notre Dame Committee for Ulster Justice, which is part of a national committee gathering congressional support in Washington for a

Viewpoint--student 
This is written in response to T. C Treanor's recent article in The Observer, in which he interpreted the election of Bob Kersten as a satirical manifestation of the immaturity of the Notre Dame student 
reflections

body. According to Mr. Treanor, the success of Kersten's campaign style shows that the only way to reach the Notre Dame student body is through an appeal to baser 0 n instincts. 
The implication from Treanor's article 
b 

is that the mature and intelligent response p0 0 a 
would have been to vote for Dziedzic in the 

hism


runoff election, thereby preserving the student political establishment from the insane satire of Mr. Kersten. As one of the Notre Dame "rabble" who voted for the Prime Mover, however, I would like to suggest that the election of Bob Kersten cannot be simply passed off as an in­dication of student immaturity and that the nature of the satire staged by Kersten is more complex than Mr. Treanor and other defenders of poobahism would have us believe. In particular, I will attempt to describe the campaign of Bob Kersten in terms of a satire upon the vocation and mentality of poobahism. 
On the most obvious level, Bob Kersten's campaign was a witty, and at times brilliant, slam against the oligarchical student political establishment at Notre Dame. It is hardly necessary for me to repeat the standard satire against the poobah as the higb school "hot shot" who satisfies his desire for getting ahead in the world by joining the elite who have secured a niche in La Fortune student center, The inflated egos of the student political figures at Notre Dame were clearly the tal'get of much of Kersten's attack. But it was more than just an attack on the personal conceit of poohbahs. The more important grievance against the student political mavericks lies in their blind adherence to what may be termed the "poobah mentality." The "poobah" mentality is characterized by the belief that although Notre Dame has serious academic and social defects, these problems can be readily eliminated and that they <i.e., the poobahs) are them­selves the instruments of such reform. 
When carried to an extreme, this men­
tality can provide the student politician, find fat asses." Although Mr. Dziedzic's 
with the image of himself as the savior of the proletariat, the leader of a new revolution which will transform Notre Dame into the "Harvard" of the Midwest. 
The gravitation towards this extreme manifestation of the poobah mentality is na more evident than during the election campaigns for Student Body President, and this year's campaigns were no ex­ception. Aside from King Kersten's campaign and the less effective campaign of Mr. Thomas, the remaining candidates had similar campaign promises. Although none of them wore crowns or explicitly claimed that th~y were uttering the will of the divine, they all had a set of formulas for improving the social, academic, and financial lives of Notre Dame students. Through a combination of co-ed dorms, the extension of the pass-fail option, an attac~ on the malicious refrigerator fine, and a call for the raising of the endowment for minority funds, the various presidential candidates believed that they could transform the condition of life at Notre 
Jerry McElroy 
Even though the promises of the can­didates this year were particularly unoriginal and hardly seemed to indicate that the candidates grasped the com­plexity of the problems which they spoke about so confidently, each of the can­didates made noble efforts to drum up support for his brand of reform. Realizing, of course, that it would be foolish to hold up John Barkett's administration as an example of how poobahs have saved the ignorant proletariat from the exploitative Administration, all of the candidates made a special point of slinging mud at Barkett. Paul Dziedzic, in response to the demand that he defend the state of student government, pointed out "that's bullshit. I have never considered myself a poobah." Tlw Observer, caught up by Dziedzic's "new approach," declared that he had the courage, intelligence, and responsibility, to "fight in the student body" and to prevent the Trustees from running the university with a carte blanche. To justify their portrayal of Mr. Dziedzic as a "knight in shining armor," the Observer noted that Dziedzic had told John Barkett to "go to hell" when he disagreed with Barkett's position on the strike at St. Mary's. This same sort of courage and individuality was manifest when Dziedzic asserted that he would "kick ass where we 
vocabulary did set him apart in some way from the other candidates, a closer ob­servation of his position on the standard campaign pledges revealed that he was another faceless poobah parading before our wearied eyes. 
The failure of the poobahs to transform the lives of the students in quite the manner in which they implied they would seems to call into question the validity of their immense claims. Even more disturbing than their failure to live up to their promises, however, is their uncanny knack for building up an inefficient organ of bureaucracy, which is so unwieldy that it is beyond the ordinary student's controL Consider. for example, the Cultural Arts Commission's cancellation of the Spring Folk Festival as a result of "mismanagement of control dealings." The Treasurer of the Student Government, ('ass Regent, is reported to have said that he'd rather not "talk figures" about this particular matter since it might "scare 


people." This quotation is the arch typal language of the poobah. You are correct if you discern a certain similarity between this type of language and the rhetoric of our national political figures, who are similarly secretive about their bureaucratic errors. Admittedly, our poobahs aren't able to start wars and drop bombs, but they have managed over the years to alienate Notre Dame students from any participation in the governing of their own lives at Notre Dame. 
The student political establishment at Notre Dame is thus a microcosm of the sickened state of politics on the national level, and it was against this establish­ment that Kersten directed much of his cogent satire. And as one of those students who have seen and heard too many poobahs, I can say that it was with no small amount of pleasure that we par­ticipated in the emancipation of ourselves from the delusory claims of the par­ticipants in the wheels of student bureaucracy . Now that the campaign has ended, however, it has become clear that the election of Bob Kersten was more than a satire against the poobahs. It was also a satire against the Notre Dame student body --but not a satire of the type described by T. C. Treanor in his own self­righteous way. The satire wasn't con­tained in our enthusiastic response to the Prime Mover. Rather, it was found in the realization that we had allowed ourselves in the past to be duped and carried along by the shallow promises and distorted mentality of political leaders. The ludicrous figure with a robe and crown, claiming to be the Prime Mover, brought out with shocking clarity the stupidity of our faith in the saving formulas and simplistic solutions of student politicians. 

So, Bob Kersten's campaign was a satire against the participation in the "poobah mentality" by both the poobahs and the student body in generaL The key question, however, is where the students go from here. It is rather clear that there is still a need for some student government mechanism, to handle various chores of an administrative nature, but it is also clear that the unwieldy bureaucracy at La l<'ortune should be reformed. Even more essential, however, is the need for the students at Notre Dame to rid themselves of poobah delusions and to realize that complex problems must be confronted with an appropriate depth of thought. There is a particular need for mature judgement on the part of the students since Notre Dame's Administration had long indulged in its own brand of the poobah mentality. Through a curious blend of paternalism and grandiose statement about the destiny of the Christian University, the Administration had managed to dress academic and social stagnancy under the cloak of "greatness". 
And the sad fact is that the penetration 
beneath the delusions of the Notre Dame 
Administration will require more than 
political slogans, of the sort which our 
brothers at La Fortune are so adept at 
coining. The solution Notre Dame's 
academic and social ills, for example, will 
not be approached simply by extending the 
pass-fail option and establishing co-ed 
dorms. In fact, the extension of the pass­
fail option too far beyond the present limits 
would force law schools and graduate 
schools to judge Notre Dame students 
almost entirely on the basis of their per­
formances on the standardized tests. 
The more effective way of combatting the academic ills would be to ask the Notre Dame Administration why the vast majority of Notre Dame students, ex­cluding those who study under the CAP, must fulfill course requirements, which may be inappropriate to their particular educational goals. The rigid separation between dep~rtments and the vast gap between the different colleges offer the students much food for reflection and criticism. And it is rather clear that many of the faculty would be more than willing to join the students in a questioning of why the Notre Dame administrative organs and its Board of Trustees are content to lag behind other schools in the im­plementation of reforms which would make Notre Dame a better community in which to live and learn. The important point to emphasize in concluding, however, is that the students can't depend upon the poobahs to ask the important 
Questions and that only a mature and in­felligent consideration of crucial issues <such as parietals) will allow the students to wage a successful war against the contracted minds of the Trustees, who wish to rule Notre Dame with a carte 
blanche.

Symposium opens festival 
Jazz panel exchanges views 
by Sue Prendergast 

The relationship between jazz and rock music dominated the jazz symposium held last night at the Center for Continuing Education. 
The symposium opened the 14th annual Collegiate Jazz Festival being held this week-end at Notre Dame. 
The panel featured CJF master of ceremonies Willis Conover of Voice of America and CJF judges Aynsley Dunbar, drummer with the Mothers of Invention; George Russel, arranger and composer, Hubert Laws, flute player with Downbeat; Jamey Aebersold, jazz conductor, and Dan Morgenstern, Downbeat editor. 
Roberta Flack, Downbeat vocalist, who will also judge festival bands, was unable to attend the symposium. She will, however, arrive later tonight and preside at the other weekend events. 
In a question and answer exchange with the audience, panel members offered their insight into jazz and the music world in general.

Many people today don't want to really listen to music, so jazz has lost popularity, Dunbar contended. 
Russell then described the development of both jazz and rock as a continuing process of "searching for new forms until the music passes beyond the understanding of most listeners ... It then "feeds" new types of music which "filter down to broader bases in forms people can ac­cept." 
Jazz is a splendid Mro-American music which represents many sources and ethnic backgrounds, Russell declared. "It affects people all over the world; why is it totally misunderstood and unsupported in its native land?"

   on life insurance 
The following letter was sub­mitted by John Consul, assistant baseball coach and a salesman for the Fidelity Union Insurance Co.. in reply to the recently printed Consumer's Union article on life insurance. ed. 
Editor: 
Last week, while I was in one of our agencies in New England, I saw an article appearing in the January 1972 issue of a magazine 
known as "Consumers Union." This particular article briefly described the sale of life in­surance to college seniors and graduates. The opinion of the writer of the article was that college seniors should not buy life insurance unless they have children. 
The article condemned the purchase of life insurance by college seniors in general, and mentioned our company in one brief paragraph. -· 
In order to re-emphasize why we strongly disagree with the position that a college senior doesn't need, or shouldn't pur­chase life insurance, I would like to summarize some facts that I know you are familiar with. 
Since 1955 we have served college seniors and graduate students by offering policies on a deferred premium arrangement under the registered service mark, "CollegeMaster." We presently have approximately Two Billion Dollars of life in­surance in force on these plans which are sold in all of the states in which we are licensed to do business. These policies are sold by a carefully selected and trained group of agents. Most of our agents are college graduates; we have not followed the practice of using college students as agents in this particular market. 
The deferred premium arrangement fills a very definite· need for college seniors and graduate students of legal age, many of whom have family and other responsibilities and many of whom upon graduation will be in the armed forces and possibly serving in Viet Nam or some other war area where the prospect of premature death is very real. The deferred premium arrangement, when used, per­mits these students to commence a permanent insurance estate at a time when they are in a favorable position to secure Our C'ollegeMaster policies generally have received com­mendation from educators, parents and others who speak highly of a plan which provides permanent life insurance protection for these young adults. We have paid to widows and parents almost Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars in Viet Nam death claims on this plan alone over the past few years. Of course, we have oaid many more thousands of dollars in benefits on account of natural and accidental death. 


Our leading policy in this market is a low-premium, non­participating form of life in­surance to which the applicant can add a number of optional benefits if he desires including the very valuable Guaranteed policy contains a special five­year pure endowment benefit payable at the end of the fifth policy year designed to take care of the major part or all of the note given for the first year's premiums. Thus, if the policy is continued to the end of the fifth year. the majority of the note (and in many instances all of the note> will be taken care of through this benefit payment from the policy. 
Our company takes every possible precaution to make certain that the applicant who avails himself of this plan knows exactly what he is doing. We follow very rigidly the regulations promulgated for this type of plan by the various State Insurance Departments. The Nation~! ~ssoiation of Insurance 
Insurability Option which per- C'ommtsstoner.s have a.dopted a 
mits him to secure additional policies at stated ages or events without evidence of insurability. The applicant executes a five-year promissory note for most of the first year's premium, the balance being remitted in the form of a cash payment. These notes currently are made payable directly to the Fidelity Union Life Insurance Company. Formerly such notes were made 
' model regulatiOn for thts type of life insurance sale to prevent abuses in the. market, which model regulation we strongly endorse. A few of the safeguards includ~. the follo:-v~ng: 

Reciting the giVIng of the note in the application for the policy, a copy of which is attached to the contract; attaching a copy of the ~ote to t~e polic.y when it is Issued; usmg a pohcy acceptance letter in which a full disclosure of 
reply card as to his full un­derstanding of and satisfaction with the policy and the note transaction. Included in the welcome letter a seond copy of the policy acceptance form is provided to make sure the in­sured was aware of what he had signed at the time of policy delivery. If an insured should indicate at the time of policy delivery or at the time he receives our letter that he has any question or is not fully satisfied, we will be glad to consider a request for can­cellation of the policy if the in­sured's question or problem is not resolved. 
To further protect the interests of our clients, we do not offer the note privilege to students under age 21 without the co-signature of a parent or legal guardian.

Hughes, biographers booked in Ne'W York 
New York, March 9 --Clifford Irving's purported "autobiography" of Howard R. Hughes was officially discredited today as the expatriate author, his wife, Edith, and his researcher, Richard Suskind, were indicted here on criminal charges. 
In the climax of a six-week investigation, a New York county grand jury charged the three with grand larceny, conspiracy and possession of forged instruments. Then, in a second indictment, it charged the 41-year-old Irving and Suskind, 38, with perjury. 
In yet another indictment, handed up by a federal grand jury, Irving and his 36-year-old artist wife were charged with conspiracy and mail fraud. The federal indictment named 
.. Suskind as a co-conspirator but not as a defendant. 
What emerged from the indictments made public at a crowded news conference at the Federal Court House here were allegations of a bold scheme to sell McGraw-Hill, Inc., what was described as a "bogus autobiography" of the wealthy, reclusive Hughes for more than $750,000. 
According to court papers, the success of the purported design rested on the belief by Irving and Suskind that the 66­year-old industrialist was either dead "or not of sufficient mental or physical capacity to denounce it." 
In addition, the papers said Irving and Suskind agreed that "regardless of Hughes's condition, they would fashion a biography of Hughes that would portray him in such a sympathetic light as to preclude him from rejecting it as his life's story." 
Among the details--some ironic, others brazen or bizarre­that emerged from the allegations in the indictments were these: 
--The germ of the plot was planted during Christmas week, 1970, when Irving read a Newsweek article about Hughes that was accompanied by a photograph of the last Ulines of a Hughes letter. Dissatisfied with his forgeries after seeing in Life an enlarged version of the Newsweek letter he had used as his model, Irving reforged the letters and was replacing them as late as last January. 
--To give their manuscript "the aura of spontaneity and ring of truth," Irving and Suskind took turns at playing the role of Hughes in interviews the two conducted to furnish them with tape recordings for their work. 
--With the cooperation of Life, which had a $250,000 con­tract to publish excerpts from the "Autobiography," Irving was given access to the confidential file on Howard Hughes of Life's parent concern, Time, Inc., and took more then 350 photographs of t!le contents of the file. 
-The search for material for the "Autobiography" in­cluded a stint at the Business Week and Aviation Week reference library at McGraw-Hill, the purported victim of the plot.
