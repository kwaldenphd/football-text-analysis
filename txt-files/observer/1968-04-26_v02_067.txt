Rossie And Committee Meet Board To Discuss Student Self-Government 
BY TIM O'MEILIA 
The Student Government panel which will meet with an Ad Hoc Committee of the Board of Trustees Sun. has been announced by Student Body President Rich Rossie. Rossie also announced that four Notre Dame professors will speak to the commi­ttee in behalf of the student causes at Sun.'s meeting. 
The Student Government panel includes Rossie, Vice President Chuck Nau, Student Union President Rick Rembusch, Student Life Coordinator Larry Landry, Mike McCauley, Executive Coordinator, Obser­ver editor Bill Luking and Judicial Coordi­nator Bob Rigney .. Rossie said his choices for the panel were predicated by his desire to represent every aspect of student life. He said Landry would handle student life, McCauley hall life and the other members would offer observations from their posi­tions of responsibility. 
The five-man Ad Hoc Committee in­cludes Board ofTrustees Chairman Edmund 
A. Stephan, Chicago attorney, and promi­nent Boston attorney Paul F. Hellmuth, who is Secretary of the Board. Other members are Dr. Thomas P. Carney, Senior 
Vice President for Research at Searle and Co.; Dr. George N. Shuste-r, Assistant to the University President, Director of the Center for the Study of Man in Contempo­rary Society and President Emeritus of Hunter College; O.C. Carmichael, Jr., Chair-

Band Is Back 

Director Robert F. O'Brien and the Notre Dame Concert Band come marching back to campus from their spring con­cert tour today. They will per­form their annual spring concert tonight at 8: 15 in the Stepan Center. The strains of the Victor)' March will once again fill the air-in case you forgot what it sounds like. 
man of the Board of the Associates and former president of Converse. College 
(N. Car.); and Dr. 0. Meredith Wilson, immediate past president of the University of Minnesota and Director of the Center' for the Study of Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University. 
Rossie said that he had invited the pro­fessors because they had "expressed an in­terest in the students and student life. They have helped us and advised us before." Rossie felt that it would be to the advan­tage of the panel to have the support of several influential faculty members. 
The faculty witnesses are Business Asso­ciate Professor John Houck, former Presi­dent of the Notre Dame chapter of the American Association of University Pro­fessors, present AAUP President and Asso­ciate Philosophy Professor Edward Manier, Education Professor Sheridan McCabe, who 
is also Director of Counseling, and Law Professor Thomas L. Shaffer. 
Although the Ad Hoc Committee is scheduled to meet with five panels from the University, the Student Government panel has been granted a three hour audi­ence. None of the other panels has been allowed more than 45 minutes. The meet­ing begins at I :30 pm Sunday in the Center for Continuing Education with the Student Government panel. 
The atmosphere of the meeting will be informal, according to Rossie. The meeting will consist of questions and answers from both sides. Rossie said, "They want all the 


facts and problems of student life. They 
may even pose questions which we have not included in our packet." The packets were distributed to the Trustees committee ear­lier. 
The packet contains several reports on hall life, including student-compiled reports of several years past. Proposals on student self-government, the judicial system and parietal hours, along with a position paper written by the Student Government panel comprise the remainder of the packet. 
Rossie does not anticipate any concen­tration on any specific subjects since the committee is interested in all phases of stu­dent life. The committee will make recom­mendations and proposals to the entire Board ofTrustees, which meets a week from Sun. Rossie said Special Assistant to the University President Philip Facenda has promised some action, but did not elabo­rate further. 
The committee will also meet with a panel of "at large" students selected by an Administration committee, according to U­niversity Vice President Rev. Charles McCarragher, CSC. The panel includes Ron Passarelli, Ron Messina, Bob Bleier, Joe Blake, David Heskin and Jim Conway. Fr. McCarragher said the Trustees wanted to consult with non-governmental students as well as governmental representatives. 
Other panels scheduled to meet with the committee include Honor Council re­presentatives, the Faculty Senate Execu­tive Committee, two panels of rectors and a panel from the Administration which is comprised of Fr. McCarragher, the Dean of Students Rev. James Riehle, CSC and lJniversity Chaplain Rev. Joseph Fey, CSC. 


Father Riehle Explains Directive Will Meet With Committee Today 
BY CHRIS WOLFE 
Father James Riehle, CSC 
Dean of Students was questioned 
for over one hour by the Student 
Senate Wed. evening concerning 
his recent directive on student 
demonstrations. 
Student Body President Rich­
ard Rossie introduced Father 
Riehle and at that time men­
tioned his own objections to the 
directive. These were the way it 
was given, without consulting 
the students in any way, the lack 
of need for such a directive, and 
its unenforceability. 
Riehle first outlined the his­tory behind his move, referring to two incidents of this year. These were the demonstrations against Dow Chemical Company at the Administration Building and the Center for Continuing Education. In each of these cases he attempted to intervene in some way, and the students poin­ted out that there was no Uni­versity rule concerning demon­strations. 
Riehle said that both cases were personally embarrassing, and he came to feel the need for ex­position of some sort of policy in regard to demonstrations. He then went through regular chan­nels, receiving approval from Un­iversity President Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, CSC. Sorin Senator Richard Stor­
atz commented that the direc­tive gave the impression that Fr. Riehle's request for 24 hour ad­vance notice seemed to give him the final say on whether a dem­onstration would be held. Father Riehle replied that the only rea­son for this part of his move was in the interests of order. 
When asked about the point that under this directive the de­monstration for Martin Luther King could not have been held. He clarified his position by say­ing that the 24 hour advance no­tice was required of those who knew of the demonstration at the time. If a demonstration was un­planned until fifteen minutes be­fore, the notification then would be acceptable. 
Mike Kelly of Breen-Phillips asked why the Dean of Students had not called any students. Fat­
her said that he had honestly thought of that but decided against it, because there was "no real reason" for it. In the future, he promised to ensure that there was some sort of communica­tion with the students. 
Jon Sherry of Lyons raised what was to be the main issue of the night when he questioned 
Father Riehle about some ambi­guity in the directive. Theoreti­cally it was agreed that Father Riehle could designate the whole 
campus as off-limits, effectively forbidding in designated restric­ted areas. This was to include the circumstance such as would rise during the May 7 Presidential Review. He felt the necessity for being able to tell the students to keep off certain areas of the par­ade ground, for instance, and such a phrase was the best way to include this. 
Rossie asked Riehle whether he was open to some sort of com­promise, or change or wording. One change in wording was Paul Higgins' suggestion of "if a stu­dent demonstration interferes with an approved University acti­vity, disciplinary bodies would have the right to control that in­
terference." Father Riehle poin­ted out that this would not in-elude buildings, in which he feels 
that demonstrations would have 
too disruptive an effect to be 
permitted. 
Various senators repeated the question concerning Father Rie­hle's willingness to compromise, and the final response was that Father Riehle did not think it was right to change a bill at this time. At Rossie's suggestion Pan­gborn Senator Jim Scherer mov­ed that a committee of senators be set up to· discuss the possibili­ty of some sort of compromise with Father Riehle. Rossie chose for this committee Scherer, Ric­hard Storatz, Pat Dowd, Steve Ahern, John Morre, Storino, and 
Mike Kelly. The meeting has been tenatevely scheduled for I 0:00 this morning. 

McCarthy Here Today 
Democratic Presidential hope­ful Senator Eugene McCarthy will address a conference on civil disorders in the Center for Con­tinuing Education at 7:30 to­night. The workshop sponsored by WNDU television is on "Re­porting the Urban Crisis." 
Only 240 seats are available for use by the general public. The topic of McCarthy's address has not yet been disclosed. 
McCarthy's speech will be the climax of a brief stop over in South Bend which will begin at 
5:00 pm when he lands at "St. Joseph County airport. He will then go to the station offices to tape an interview. Atter his address at the conference McCar­thy will fly on to Gary, Indiana. 
A spokesman for the Univer­sity said that Senator McCarthy will probably return to campus to address the student body be­fore the Indiana presidential pri­mary.

Rembusch Announces Future Plans May Call Outside Help On Robbery 
page 2 THE OBSERVER 
--------------------------------------~~------------­
BY TIM O'MEILIA 
Student Union President Rick 
Rembusch told the Student Sen­
ate he was considering calling in 
an outside police force to con­
tinue the investigation of the 
Student Union robbery of $3000. 
In a Student Union report to the 
Senate. Rembusch said that he 
had spoken to Security Director· 
Arthur N. Pears yesterday con­
cerning the progress in the case. 
Rembusch said he was satis­
fied with most of Pear's explan­
ations but that he was not happy 
with some parts of the investi­
gation. According to Rembusch 
Pears said the two sets of fin­
gerprints taken from the safe are 
not of good quality and have not 
been compared with those of 
the eight to ten higher echelon 
members of the Union. Pears said a comparison would be made when a prime suspect emerges. The polygraph tests have not 
been administered because of skilled personnel necessary to give the tests. South Bend police will administer only two tests and none of the law enforce­ment agencies in the surrounding area would agree to administer them. 
The case was left to the sec­
urity police at the request of 
Pears and Vice President for 
Student Affairs Rev. Charles Me 
Carragher. 
Rembusch announced several 
of the social events for next year 
are now in the process of 
being planned. There will be sev­en concerts during the football season, one for each of the home games and one probably on Sept. 20. The Union is pre­sently negotiating with Lou' 
Rawles, Harry Belafonte, the 
Four Tops, Simon and Garfun­
keL the Chad Mitchell Trio and 
Glen Yarborough, among others. 
Next year's Student Union 
trip will be to Michigan State 
on Oct. 26. Rembusch said that 
the Union hopes to have only one 
Homecoming dance next year, 
which is Oct. 19, the day of the 
lllinois game. 
The Union is planning a Tip­
off celebration on Dec. 7, for 
the UCLA game. Plans are not 
yet complete however. A Grand 
Prix du Lac is also being consid­
ered, modeled after Indiana Uni­
versity's Little '500' weekend. 
The weekend would include a 
race around campus In hall-spon­
sored go-carts, with pit stops, 
radio coverage from the tops of 
buildings and other embellish­
ments. A concert is also pending 
for the May weekend. 
The Academic Commission is 
planning a Constitutional Con­
vention, more Senatorial debates, forums of student power, Black Power speakers such as Stokeley Carmichael, a major free film movie series, athletic speakers such as A.J. Fovt, Jimmy Brown, and Casey Stengel and other pro­grams. 

Rembusch said the Student Service Commission will have 
next year's student directory out earlier and with more copies. "Faille," a booklet for incoming freshmen, will be reinstituted. A new, larger shuttle bus will almost certainly be purchased. The bus transportation to O'Hare International Airport will be con­tinued at every vacation. Meas­ures have also been taken to col­lect debts owed to the Student Press. 
Vice President Bill Wade is investigating the possibility of purchasing a press, especially if the Observer decides to contract a wire service and begin pub­lishing daily. Former Observer 
editor Pat Collins said the cost of the press, $18,600, would save money m the long run since the present cost of the Observer 
is $10,000 annually. The press 

could be used for other purposes also, such as the student direc­tory and the Student Course and 
Teacher Evaluation. 

Miller Wants Competition For Nixon Predicts 1968 Republican Victory 
BY TOM EHRBAR Touching upon such topics as the American two-party sys­tem, the morality of the Nur­emburg Trials, the Rockefeller draft movement, and the Repub­lican chances in 1968, former Vice Presidential candidate Wil­liam E. Miller addressed the ND law students and faculty Tues. evening. His comments, given at Randalls Inn, were sprinkled with tongue-in-cheek allusions to his own political disater in 1964. Miller, an ND graduate, op­ened his talk by requesting that those present "take an active interest in politics". He urged a vigorous participation within 
the context of the two-party system." The two-party system is America's key to greatness. It must be preserved." Miller fur­condemned current third-party or independent movements, and 
suggested the possibility of the next U.S. president being deter­mined by the House of the Representatives because of the strength of these peripheral par­ties. A prosecuter at the Nurem­burg Trials, Miller spoke of a delicate moral problem which emerged from the verdicts of the Trials. The defense of "superior order", employed by the German officers, was abolished by the international court on the gro­unds that every individual is obligated to follow his own con­science. "Yet today", Miller said, "we have young people burning draft cards, claiming that they are merely following their con­science. Who has the answer?" After his brief talk, a lengthy question and answer session brought out Miller's appraisal of the current Republican scene. 

He saw the long figure of Richard Nixon, now virtually unchal­lenged, as a definite party weak­ness. "Nixon must have compe­tition, if not, he can avoid all the issues; and the Democrats will have all the front pages to themselves." Only through de­bate and discourse will the Re­publican position be defined. 
Miller himself, favors Gov. Rockefeller as the GOP nom­inee in 1968. However, he in­
sists, "Nelson, within the next three weeks, has got to make an announcement whether he is a candidate or not. I don't be­lieve in drafts or deadlock con­ventions." 
Gov. Rockefeller, according 
to Miller, is a well-known and proven administrator. He has been elected governor three times in a strong Democratic state. He is a vigorous campaigner, a winner. In summary, Mr. Miller said, "Gov. Rockefeller is the most capable man to fill a void in the Republican Party." Still, Miller is not part of a "Stop Nixon Movement." He claimed, "I will work hard for the party 
nominee, whoever he may be." 
"Nixon is the choice of the Republican political pro's", Mil­ler said, "He has helped many congressional candidates over the years." Accordingly, this should prove his strength in Miami. Miller repeated his concern that if Mr. Nixon is given the nomin­
ation, with no serious opposi­
tion, he will be able to avoid 
salient issues and remain a vague 
personality. 

One particular issue, stressed· 
by Goldwater and Miller in 1964, 
and still held by Miller today, is 
to balance the budget and strengt­
hen the American dollar." Other­wise," he said, "the current pol­icy of deficit spending will even­tually result in the economic collapse of the country." 
Asked to comment on Gov. Romney of Michigan, Miller said, "he didn't catch on fire." As for 
the three-w.ay struggle within the Democratic ranks, Miller closed his talk saying, "This year we can beat any of them".

Student Government Now Financially Autonomous 
Student Body President Rich­ard Rossie made several an­nouncements to the student Sen­ate meeting Wed. night. The first was that the old Student Center policy had been reactiva­ted, giving control over the Cen­ter to the House Committee of the Senate.

WILLIAM LUKING, Editor-in-Chief FOUNDED NOVEMBER 3. 1966 NOTRE DAME, INDIANA 
Before The Board 
All the campaign oratory, all the student demogogury, all 
the planning, and the General Assembly of Students are very 
minor points of history. Although student life probably will 
not be radically altered after Student Body President Rossie's 
committee's meeting with the Board of Trustee's ad hoc com­
mittee Sunday afternoon, it is Sunday's meeting which will 
determine the future of this year's issues ot concern. 
It is student life that the Rossie committee will discuss with 
the Board. It will be General Assembly resolutions on student 
self government, the judicial system, hall life, and parietal 
hours that the two committees will consider. If these ideas 
are to become realities, the process must start with Sunday's 
meeting. 

The material to be presented to us seems quite logical and 
we can find no reason to oppose immediate implementation 
of the concept of student self government as provided for by 
the General Assembly of Students. We also have faith in Mr. 
Rossie and his committee and hold that they will represent 
the student body before the Trustees as ably as any other 
group of students. It is with great respect that we commend 
the faculty members who will appear before the board as 
witnesses for the student committee. And it is with respect that we ask the Board members to fully consider the material and J.he ideas to be presented Sunday. 
It is unfortunate that this meeting has been so long in com­
ing. It is indeed time for students to present their plans for stu­
dent self government to the men who must ultimately act or 
fail to act upon or must inact or reject the proposals Mr. 
Rossie will make Sunday. 
We have faith that the Board's committee will be favorably impressed with much of what Mr. Rossie will present and most probably the ad hoc committee will recommend and the entire Board will approve certain changes in University policy governing student life. 
But the problem that remains is one of degree. Will the Board listen long enough? Will its members react unfavorab­ly to the vague threat of student power, or will they wait and 
listen and learn and realize what student life is like and how it can be bettered to the advantage of the students and the University? 
Let us hope they sit and listen long enough. 
A Stand Taken 
We commend and applaud Father Hesburgh's stand endor­
sing the Poor People's March on Washington. We too ask 
"What are you willing to do?" And we note that it will take 
concern and effort on the part of many segments and people 
to effect any changes in the economic disfranchaise of a size­
able per centage of our population. We hope that the March 
may be a start, a call to conscience. 
Besides serving as a statement of support for the Poor 
People's campaign, Father Hesburgh's statement is encour­aging for it is the voice of the University speaking on a ques­tion of moral and social significance. 
Student criticism has been leveled in the past and will be raised again at the failure of elders, teachers, and the Admin­istration of this University to take stands on the problems of war and poverty facing the nation. 
Father Hesburgh has spoken out on this issue. Let us listen to him, and let us hope that he will use his position, as his conscience might direct, in the future to take stands on the problems that face us.

In the midst of the driving sleet characteristic of late April in 
South Bend, a great cumulus cloud of students is seen massing, 
changing shapes, being blown by some invisible force towards the 
library. Perhaps it is a group of late afternoon textbook readers and 
term paper writers, wafting toward the temple of learning in search 
of scholarly materials. 

Alas, no. For someone in their midst is a concealed gem of great 
price, Dustin Hoffman, star of stage, screen and Volkswagen com· 
mercials. Who, Dustbin Kauffman? Who, Dutchman Laughlin? No, 
you remember the little guy in The Graduate. Oh, him. 
Judging from the flow of the crowd, Hoffman is walking through 
the crowd, stopping here and there to talk to people and to sign 
autographs. Nobody further back than the th.ird row of milling 
camp followers is able to glimpse the star of the show. Someone 
suggests that next time they should get John Wayne so people in the back row would be able to spot him. Is he for McCarthy? What difference does that make? After standing in the library lobby long enough to destroy the 
dramatic continuity of John Logan's poetry reading (are poetry and 
politics incompatible?), the group moves inside. The crowd is so 
thick that the library officials are forced to permit them to take 
down the ropes that normally prevent people from entering or leav­
ing without the mandatory click through the turnstiles. 
In ~he meanwh~le, some graduate student who has been hiding on 
the s_IXth 0oor smce November is presumably able to sneak out 
carrymg his one hundred favorite library books to add to his per­
sonal collection. 

Somebody suggests that it is not really Dustin Hoffman at all 
but only Mary Perrone dressed in a suit. No, this is not true. Mary 
Perrone is taller. 

And she is. The crowd swings back and we can see the celebrity for the first time. Mary Perrone is presiding over him with an air that mixes teenybop hero worship, advanced mother henning, and a quasi-professional politico manner reminiscent of six year olds play­ing house. 
"Dustin will speak to you in the Memorial Library auditorium at four-thirty," says Mary Perrone in her best official voice. "He wants to talk to you all. He's really interested in speaking to you." The small unobtrusive actor is standing two feet away, but from her tone he could be a divine apparition set up by special papal inter­vention. 
I have visions of the hangers-on of history. "Why don't you go wait at the Mount?" booms Simon Peter to the multitudes. "He'll be there to talk to you in a few minutes. He has some important beatitudes to list." 
At the appointed time, Hoffman, or rather Mr. Dustin, takes the stage. In a moment the carnival atmosphere is gone. His weak voice barely reaches the back rows, but he is talking to his audience, not at it. And it turns out that he is important not because he's special but because he isn't. Worrying about the times, he asks not for votes but for a sincere effort from his audience to make a good choice. And he tells us why he admires McCarthy's courage and it's pretty much the same reason we all have. 
All in all, it was a good speech even though it wasn't as im­promptu as it seemed, since he gave it again, word for word, at St. Mary's that night. Even so, it was his speech and talked about the way he felt. It had its rough edges and wasn't smoothed out for 
maximum voter appeal. It was politics but a new and better k.10d All in all, it was at least an A-minus for the McCarthy campaign. ·

There are indeed certain objections to be made to the execution of the demons­tration on April 3, against President Doan of Dow Chemical, but it would seem that the surprise move by the Administration to bar the admission of peaceful protest-ors to Doan's talk after permission had previously been given for student attend­ance at the conference, was the most irn­mediate if not the only cause of an "em­

was told that there was no need for con­sideration of student opinion on the directive or the directive's content before issuance. Even if, as is most strongly sus­pected, the Administration has little in­terest in letting students participate in the legislation of student life (e.g., parietal hours), it would seem at least practical

to c ec out t e consequences in terms of student response to such administrative impositions. 
There's no limit to legislation by whim. ·Idiosyncrancies of administrators and en­forcers could well become rules governing student life. Father Riehle1is directive .marks a generous attempt by the Admin· istration to "make student demonstra­tions meaningful and orderly," a set of instructions on how to do so. This part­icular directive and the questions of its necessity or the University's interest in putting more meaning into student de­monstrations aside, while we're consider­ing order and meaningfulness, perhaps someone can provide some suggestions for making directives from the Dean of Stu­dents or anyone else a bit more meaning­ful and their issuance a little more orderly. 
The fact that the Administration is concerned with directives on student de­monstrations is in itself encouraging. May­be someday the Administration will ask what students are demonstrating about and why.

Used to be that you could walk into the corner drug store, pick up a Super­man Comic book, and know with perfect certitude that you were holding in your grimy little paw at least a half hour's

ion remains unimpaired. 

After profound and careful considerati­on, I believe I have fmally uncovered that fundamental, aesthetic flaw which has crept into the Superman Comic. His adventures are no longer incredible; they are absurd. 
Alas, gentle seeker of escapism, it is sad but true. Our hero has betrayed that most profound trust. He has gone too far. He has overstepped the thin line which divides Metropolis from Chicago and Clark Kent from Bobby Kennedy. . 
In the most recent issue I was appalled to find my alter-ego virtually prostitu­ting his super powers by involving him­self in so ridiculous an affair as a race riot. For twenty pages I suffered with my

IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIUIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII 
Most people who contend that the Administration and its mother figure the Board of Trustees has no right governing the lives of the students here do so categorically ; the implicit half of their contention is that the student community 
is both prepared and capable of governing themselves. The assumption that under­lies this is that perhaps there once was a time when the Ad­ministration actually felt the need for step­

the lives of students. The exact nature of the change from that time to this is fre­quently unnoted; it 1 
is simply that there 
has been, especially
within the last decade, 
a growth toward a com­plete integration of the whole universtiy com­munity. 
To be sure there are some segments of the university it has not touched. The graduate school still operates on an entirely separate plane, as does Moreau Seminary to a Jesser extent. What is striking with regard to Moreau is the move away from isolation. Even in the late fifties the seminary functioned almost 
entirely apart from the campus. This had 
a telling effect on the young Holy Cross 
priests who will control the Administra­
tion within the next five years and will 
continue to do so for the next decade. 
Several expressed deep regrets that while 
they were students here they were not 
involved in what went on on the campus. 
This aspect of isolationalism is steadily 
decreasing thanks especially to the efforts 
of Father Putz, the new director of the 
seminary. 
An even more significant aspect of the decrease in privatism, the feeling of being a distinctive group apart from the rest of the university community, has been that which characterized what one might call for lack of a better word the intellectuals (do not read "grinds"). The development in the life style of the intellectual here has a locational metaphor in that it has expanded from Lyons to include Farley, Morrissey, even ~ilion and now Holy Cross. The predommance ofLyons as the place for the intellectuals on campus was brought home to me when a member of

the faculty who studied both here and at Oxford found Lyons as the only example of a hall on this campus which might par­
allel a college at Oxford. The intellectual f
spent most o his time in his room in 
Lyons, reading and writing, expressing
little or no interest in the activities ot the 
campus in general, aside from vague dis­dain. Some of the disdain is still present. But in a very real sense the intellectual student is now much close-r associated wt'th the student community as a whole. The difference that the demise of this species ofprivatism makes in the structure of that community is a very telling one. It has been a coordinate development 
. with the growth of stay hall, and it has 
given birth to such strange phenomena 
as a design-oriented yearbook and a 
Student Body President who is also a 
Collegiate Scholar. Moreover it has led 
to increased student interest on every 
level of student body in "student power" 
and "student rights," as well as the aca­
demic and social structures of the Uni­
versity. It has, finally, led to the sophis­
tication of the students. A fact that the 
Board of Trustees might recall Sunday, 
when it meets to consider changes in 
parietal hours and related aspects of 
student life. A fact that considered ser­
iously enough, might even prompt the 
Trustees to wonder why they're being 
asked to make such judgements at all. 
Van C~mp.Onlyon~e did he have the op­portumty to use h1s mass of muscle, and that WaS Only when he held back the mob so that Lois Lane could extract the heel of her shoe from the mouth of a would-be attacker. 
The remainder of this ludicrous episode 
was spent leaping tall buildings at a single 
bound in an effort to attend three different 
conferences being held at the same time by 
'concerned civic leaders'. 

On page nineteen it looked as if Super­
man had finally met his match. Defeat was 
staring him directly in the face. His 
super brain was reeling from the impact of 
a myriad of empty rational1"zat1·ons and 
promises which were hurled at him during the meetings and his super strength had been completely drained by the bombasts of hot a1·r he had sust,;;ned.
...... 

As he stared blankly down at the street to see looters carrying off Jimmy Olsen he was heard to mutter: "If only I had lis­tened to Perry White I could be out in the suburbs right now planting a tree_ or a 
shrub." 

In a final last ditch effort to save the fine citizens of Metropolis from the im­pending peril, Superman flew like a speed­ing bullet to the nearby U.S. mint where approximately one hundred billion dollars were secretly hidden by the government. A note at the bottom of the page from the editors tells us that this was precisely one half the amount currently being spent to wage a small nuclear war of containment in southeast California. 
Retuning like a flash of light to the beleagured city, the man of steel scattered these bills over the rioters. But to no avail. The combattants obviously thought 
the bills to be more useless campaign propaganda, for this was an election year. 
The story is to be continued in the next issue but I, for one, won't be around to see its absurd conclusion. After all, a Superman Comic costs 12 cents and the Observer is free.

One of the great and persisting scandals of our day is the sad fact that in the most affluent nation ot the world there are millions of people, Negroes, Spanish­speaking Americans, whites, and others ­such as American Indians -who are perennially, almost institutionally, con­demned to a life of poverty. Directly or indirectly, intentionally or sub-conscious­ly, the condemnation of the minority is inflicted by the white majority of this na­tion. We have gradually been evolving into two nations, side by side, separate and­
unequal, developed and underdeveloped. At the heart of this poverty is a triple inequality of opportunity-in education, in employment, and in housing. Each side of this dismal triangle supports the other two sides: poor schools mean lack of preparation for meaningful employ­ment. Lack of employment or menial,

Crowd 
Dustin Hoffman, star of The Graduate and McCarthy cam­paigner, was mobbed by crowds of enthusiastic students in visits to Notre Dame and St. Mary's Wednesday. Speaking impromptu to an audience of more than 500 in the Library Auditorium, Hof­fman spoke of his work for the Minnesota Senator, saying "If I have ever felt I was doing some­thing constructive in my life, it is now." 
Hoffman appeared at Notre Dame about 3:30 in the after­noon, and was greeted by a crowd of more than I00 at the Circle. 
From there he walked to the Library with a stop at the Hud­dle. At the Library, the actor was greeted by a crowd of 600 which pressed around him and then crowded into the Library Audit­orium. 
In his Library speech, Hof­fman explained his support of McCarthy, saying "The reason I'm involved in this js perhaps very selfish. I've always been apolitical. I was told not to back Senator McCarthy, that it would hurt me at the box office. When I made the decision, though, I didn't have to reflect or worry. I live in very acute times. There's a holocost taking place in many of our cities. When I think of' 

raising children in this environ­ment, the thought of whether something will hurt me at the­box office is suddenly very in­significant." 
"Everyone has very indivi­dual feelings about the Vietnam war. I myself was very concerned about the war when McCarthy came out against it. I saw him risk his political career against this war. He was saying what he believed....He put his cards on the table."
