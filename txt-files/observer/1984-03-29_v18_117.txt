Cheating outcry misdirected 
The Observer is irresponsible. 
The Obsemer doesn't cover stories fairly. 
The Obsemer is about as unprofessional as a 
newspaper can be. 

These are common complaints towards Notre Dame's only daily newspaper. They arc being heard more often in recent days because ofa March 15 article this paper published concerning cheating within the University. Many students have written letters com­plaining that the article was partial and said they were offended by the statistics reported, especially those about the Chemistry 1 1 5·1 16 course taught by Prof. Emil T. Hofman. 
John Neblo's article states, "The course cited most often (for cheating) is Chemitry 1 1 5-l I 6, where stu­dents speculate that the vast majority of the class has cheated at least once and some students have virtually passed the course by cheating." 
In reacting to this article, Hofman told his class , which is mostly freshmen, that he "felt betrayed" by students who cheated on the quizzes, and walked out on the class. 
"One couldn't help but feel moved by what he said. A lot of people thought he might have overreacted. His overreactioin is understand­able, however, since the ar­ticle did make some rather hasty generalizations," said Mike Millen, a freshman who was present at the class Hof. man left. 

That Hofman was disap­pointed with alleged cheating is obvious, but the question remains as to whether The Obsemer was wrong to make such a broad statement based upon the opinions of a few students. Did the paper jump the gun on this story in order to make it more readable and interesting? 
Nearly everybody has heard ofsome kind ofcheating in Hofman's chemistry class at one time or another. Whether it is the discreet glance at the next person's paper or a review session the night before with a · hijacked quiz, the majority ofstudents who don't cheat at least know somebody who has cheated. Cheating is a problem in every class, not just Hofman's. It's a tempta­tion to anybody who has the opportunity, and oc­casionally we sacrifice our principles for a better quiz or test grade. 
But it's not up to The Observer to moralize for the student body. We in the news department try daily to objectively report the events going on around campus, from the lectures and concerts to the uses and abuses of power. This is no easy task. With no journalism school

to train our writers and editors, we learn from our mistakes and gain from our successes. 
Once in a while we make a blunder so major that we must print a retraction. Once in a while an inaccuracy slips by and we must correct it the next day. Sometimes we slip out of our objectivity and either accidently or purposely let our true colors fly in our news story. 
But there will he no retraction ofJohn Neblo's cheat· ing story. The information we received was accurate, as we understood it. 
The letters published in the viewpoint section this past week from some of the freshmen in Hofman's course complain that the reporter was unfair in making the statemen~hat 
there is cheating in hat class. Following Hof n's berating of the class, s~Jme students were so moved that they felt it necessary to publicly voice their com­plaint in The ObsProer.

Wrote freshman Stephen O'Neil, "The Obsemer ... -unfairly tarnished the reputations that honest stu­dents are just beginning to build for themselves .... Instead of commending Dr. 
Hofman for the work he has done by promoting honesty and Christian morality through his example to students, it unfairly damaged reputation he has built over thirty years." 
Since The Obsen1er is only trying to objectively report on cheating by what we have been told by stu­dents who take the course, perhaps it is not the newspaper that is irresponsible but the students them­selves. Maybe their consciences bothered them so much after Hofman's tirade that they thought they had to pass the blame to the newspaper. 
Maybe it's time the freshmen in Hofman's class realized that in the real wor!::l the news isn't always good, even if it's about themselves. We all make mistakes, but when we do we shouldn't try to blame somebody else for tht.m.

Preservation Hall Jazz Festival March 30, 1984 8pm at Saint Mary's O'Laughlin Auditorium $2 Students/Faculty $5 General Admission SMC Students Free 
Only standing room only seats left 
Preservation hall Jazz Band plays at SMC as part of concert series 
By DIANNE MCBRIEN 
News Staff 
Saint Mary's continues its Performing Arts Series tomorrow night with the Preservation HallJazz Band Festival, beginning at 8 in O'Lauglin Auditorium. 
Tickets, which may be reserved by calling the Moreau Box Office at 284-4626, are S5 for general admis­sion and S2 for students and senior citizens. Admission is free for Saint Mary's students. 
Selected for the series by a com­

mittee of Saint Mary's faculty, staff, 
and students, the New Orleans­
based Preservation Hall Jazz Band represents the best of an American tradition blues and gospel-influenced New Orleans jazz. 
The group was formed in the mid­1950's, a poor period for New Orleans jazz when few of its musicians were active. Some of them claimed Preservation Hall, an old building in the city's French quarter, as their coffeehouse -a casual place where musicians could perform. Soon the 200 year-old building became a popular spot for bands and jazz lovers alike. 

The Preservation Hall Jazz Band is the most famous of the groups performing at the Hall. A seven­piece band, it has undergone several personnel changes in its nearly 30 years. The present touring group in­cludes Frank Demond, trombone; Percy G. Humphrey, trumpet; Wil­liam Humphrey, Jr., clarinet; Alan 
Jaffe, bass horn; Marvin Henry Kim­
ball, banjo; James Edward Sing Mil­ler, piano; and Frank Parker, drums. 
Concerts on tour recreate the relaxed, spontaneous atmosphere of Preservation H<!ll jam sessions. There is no listed program; the
1 
musicians decide what to play by the audience's reactions. People feel free to sway and dance to the music, especially when musicians lead members of the audience on stage 
during their rendition of When the 
Saints Go Marchini< In. 
Remaining tickets are for folding chairs and standing room only. 


Senate expects El Salvador aid bill to pass while Shultz has objections 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -A democratic leader yesterday predicted Senate approval ofa compromise 561.7 mil­lion military aid package for El Sal­vador, but Secretary ofState George Shultz said he would resist any move to cut off the aid if the government now being chosen is overthrown in a military coup. 
"I think it is not necessary and is inappropriate to seem to be predict­ing that possibility," Shultz said. "The military in El Salvador has gone to great lengths to depoliticize themselves. I don't see any evidence ofanything to the contrary." 
Shultz made his remarks to the Senate Appropriations subcommit­tee that oversees the State Depart­ment budget. 
Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., said he had heard speculation about a pos­sible coup if centrist presidential candidate Jose Napoleon Duarte, who led in Sunday's first round of voting in El Salvador, is elected in a runoff expected to be held in May. 
He asked Shultz if he would sup­port an amendment to cut off aid in that event. "No, sir," Shultz said. 
The Senate is expected to vote this week on a bill that would provide $61.7 million in emergency military aid to El Salvador in the cur­rent fiscal year. The Appropriations Committee approved $93 million in aid by a close vote earlier this month, but the Reagan administra· tion compromised on the lower figure after Senate Democrts threatened to delay action. 
Congress has already approved $64.8 million in military aid for the Central American nation in this fis­cal year, but ordered that $20 mil­lion of it could not be spent until there is a trial and verdict in the case of four American churchwomen murdered in E1 Salvador in Decem­ber, 1980. 
Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, the sponsor of the compromise measure, told reporters, "It's going to pass." Inouye is chairman of a Democratic task force on Central America and senior Democrat on the appropriations subcommittee that handles foreign spending. 

Inouye said Sen. Edward M. Ken­nedy, D·Mass., indicated in a meeting of the <aSk force that he plans to offer an amendment to provide only enough money to last through May, withholding further installments until after the runoff when the makeup of the new government is known. 

Meanwhile, Rep. Clarence Long, D-Md., chairman of the House Ap­propriations subcommittee on foreign operations, said, "I am con­cerned that we need them (the Sal­vadoran regime) more than they need us, and we are going to con­tinue to give them arms no matter how atrocious their behavior is." 
Long spoke at a subcommittee hearing at which Aryeh Neier, chair­man of the Americas Watch Com­mittee, testified, "In recent months, the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador, with the intermittent support of the Reagan administration, has con­ducted a campaign against killings and disappearances of civilian non­combatants" by death squads. 
"This campaign has had an impact, reducing the number to about a dozen each week," Neier said. Nevertheless, he said, the human rights group opposes all military aid 
to El Salvador because of consistent 
"violations of internationally 
recognized human rights."

Girl Scout drive tainted by objects 
Associated Press 

More than I00 peopk have taken advantage of a Crawfordsville hospi­tal's offer to X-ray Girl Scout cookies after a Crawti>rdsvilk man found a needle in a mint cookie. 
Meanwhile, Girl Scouts in Evansville ended their annual cookie sale li>ur days early, and Fort Wayne officials awaited word on whether Girl Scout cookies would he distributed, after national reports of cookies containing needles and other small objects. 
In Crawfordsville, where a sewing needle was found in a Girl Scout cookie Monday, Culver Union llospital offered X-ray seFice Tues­day through tonight. Micfiacl J Kid­well, radiology assistant, said yesterday that no foreign objects were found so far. 
Kidwell said about II 0 people came in Tul·sday night to have more than 70 cases ofcookies checked. 
"Tonight we've had about I 5 cases," brought in in the first half hour, Kidwell said. The service is being offered from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. 
Shirley Gooding ofCrawfordsville found a needle Monday when she determined a thin mint cookie "didn't look right" and broke it open. She had not bitten into the 

Lava flows within miles of city as Hawaii prepares for eruption

Th(' main lava tlow slowed during the night. advancing to within seven miles of homes in llilo's upper Kaurnana section, said Reggie Okamura of th(" I '.S. Geological Sur­Vl"y's Hawaiian Volcano Obser­vatory. 
There was no immediate danger to populated areas on the island of Hawaii. he said. Thl' main flow rt:achnl a fairly llat area and its ad­vance slowed to about ·H>O feet per hour. Okamura said.

Police said it appeared to have been baked into the cookie and not inserted through a tampered box. 
Pins, needles, and paper clips were first discovered two weeks ago in Missouri cookies sold by St. Louis Girl Scouts. Since then, reports of contamination have come from Colorado, Kentucky, Nebraska, Georgia, Indiana, Maine, Illinois, Ohio, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Minnesota, although some of the reports turned out to be hoaxes. 
At Terre Haute, Terre Haute Regional Hospital also offered to ex­amine cookies with a flouroscope for foreign objects. 
Dr. Benjamin Ko, director of radiology, said yesterday that the service that began a day earlier will continue "as long as people are scared c:nough." 
"I can't do it in my rush hours in the morning hut in the slow hours in the afternoon (from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.) anyone who wants to can bring the cookies in," he said. 
Ko said that two boxes ofcookies were brought in Tuesday but no harmful objects were found. Late yesterday, no one had brought in cookies, he said. Ko joked that he was happy to offer the service "as long as people give me one·· cookie. 
said, hut he could not estimate how 
long the lava would build up before 
tumbling downhill again. 

The front of the: flow widened to 
just under a mile wide, he said. 

The !low earlier had been moving 
at I ,000 feet per hour, and at that 
rate it could have reached homes in 
the city of 48.000 today. 

Civil defense oftlcials made: no 
move to evacuate residents and 
Mayor Herbert .\1atayoshi said it was 
too early to declare an emergency. 

Some residents of the Kaumana 
area made tentative plans to move 
belongings, but most said they 
weren't worried yet. 

''I'll leave if the flow comes within 
two miles," said Souza, a resident of 
the new Kaumap~~~<;;ity subdivision 
closest to the flow. 

"I don't want to fool around with nature," he said. ''I'm not going to stay around to try to diven the lava in order to save the house," said Souza, :H, who moved into the: sub­division with his wife Linda and their two daughtl·rs last October.

Ko compared the cookie scare to the 
scare that results when objects are 
found in Halloween treats. 

In Fort Wayne, officials of the · area's Limberlost Girl Scout Council, which administers scout programs in Adams, Allen, DeKalb, Hun­tington, Steuben and Wells Counties, were awaiting word from national Girl Scout officials on what to do about cookie sales. Delivery had been scheduled for April 9 through April 30, with store sales scheduled for April 18, 21, 2 5 and 28. 
Wayne McDowell, Limberlost ex­ecutive director, said the sale of 366,500 boxes of cookies was ex­pected to net 5350,000 for the area· council. i 
Jan Davies, a spokeswoman for; Evansville scouts, said sales at four . cookie stores were suspended Tues­day. "We were staffing those stores i with volunteers, and people were concerned and not buying cookies, so we closed the stores," she said. 
Mrs. Davis said there have been no reports of foreign objects in any of the 384,000 boxes of cookies sold by the local scout organization. 
At Lafayette, Sycamore Council spokeswoman Audrey Dirksen said the Crawfordsville situation ap­peared to be an isolated incident. 
100 feet high was feeding the main flow and several smaller flows, Okamura said. 
One of the smaller flows had threatened the 72-inmate Kulani Prison, hut stopped about three miles above the minimum-security facility. None of the smaller flows posed any threat, although one had cut a secondary power line serving a television relay station. 
State and county officials on Tues­day rejected a proposal to build giant earthen walls to ddlect the lava. The barriers were not feasible and could divert the flow from one residential area to another, Gov. George Ariyoshi said.· 
Officials also rejected a 'proposal to bontlJ the flow and other large­scale efforts to divert it. 
Scientists also were keeping a close watch on Kilauea Volcano, which has been erupting intermit­tently about 20 miles away siticejan.

On the issue of nuclear arms, Nur said jackson's main priority is negotiation. He said, "if w,. go to them in a militaristic manner, they will respond in like fashion.

Ft. Lauderdale tragedy 
It was a warm Tuesday night in Ft. Lauderdale. After a long day on the beach and in the bars, the Georgia Tech students un­winded on the Holiday Inn pool deck. The group began to tease one ofits members. They tossed his hat around the deck, until it drifted over the rail onto the pavement below. 
Diane Dirkers Guest column 
The student, in a spirit of play and inspired by alcohol, sprinted across the pool deck. Un­fortunately he didn't stop at the rail. The im­pact catapulted him over the rail to land head-first in the street below. 
Suddenly, the fun and games, and "let loose" attitude came to a sobering halt. The student died in the street as hundreds of vacationing students watched in horror. 
This incident occurred while Notre Dame was on Spring Break. It was not a daredevil stunt, it was not suicide -it was a result of uncontrolled drinking. It could have hap­pened to anyone and if the wild partying at­mosphere of Ft. Lauderdale continues, it will happen again. 
So who is responsible? Obviously the stu­dent, but who else? Accord .ing to the law, much of the liability lies with the bartender and the hotel. Lawsuits will be filed and whoever is deemed liable will pay, but would it not have been better ifthe parties had taken responsibility before the fact -preventing an unnecessary death? 
Notre Dame is in a situation quite similar to that of the Holiday Inn. If ths same incident occurred on the 1 1 th floor ofFlanner, the Uni­versity would be held responsible. This is precisely the reason it wishes to control and possibly eliminate drinking on the campus. But is a dry campus the answer? 

If the campus goes dry next year, student drinkng will not halt -it will just move off­campus. Off-campus drinking cannot be checked. Masses of students, with their first exposure to freedom, will have no one to oversee their drinking. Add to this the dangers of driving and of walking in an intoxicated state, and there you have it -the Ft. Lauderdale atmosphere. 
Would action by the administration making Notre Dame a dry campus be an act ofrespon· sibility towards the students, or just a way to shift the liability to others who will be less responsible? Does the administration expect overcrowded local bars to cut offevery single student who has had too much? 
As an employee of one of those bars, I honestly say I could not do that It isn't that I don't try or don't wish to -it's simply not feasible to monitor people and see where the drinks are going. 
So what are the alternatives? Public in­toxication laws exist in every state. It is not breach ofstudent rights to punish those who become overly intoxicated, as they are a real threat to themselves as well as to others. On­campus parties are smaller and better con­trolled. The hall rectors, the hall staffs and the students in charge ofthe parties are in a much better position to monitor the drinking level than the bartenders at the Five Points or off­campus residents. 
The administration should seriously con­sider the dry campus issue. Is it acting responsibly or merely shifting the respon­siblity elsewhere? Ifthe well-being of the stu­dents is truly the issue here, the administration should take a closer look at in­stituting a "dry campus." It is the worst mistake the administration could ever make. 
Diane Dirkers is a senior and a bartender at a local tavern.

Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's fencing team placed eighth out of an eleven-team field at the National Intercollegiate Women's Fencing Association Na­tional Championship competition, held March I 7 at Hunter College of the City University of New York. 
St. John's University captured first place in the 56th annual tourna­ment, while the College of William and Mary finished second and the 
U.S. Naval Academy third.

"l was very disappointed because Mary Ann just had a bad day," said Dejong. "She got into a rut and it's hard to psyche yourself up when you're not fencing well." 
Wilkin fenced in the C division and compiled a 5-5 record that earned fourth place in her division. 
Raney competed in the Bdivision and posted a 3-7 record while Waters earned a 5-5 mark in the D division. 
The NIWFA Tournament ll'larked the end of this season for the lrHes but DeJong looks ahead to a promis­ing season for next year.

"We have to keep the Nationals in the back of our minds and con­centrates on the day to day matches and do well if we want to go," said Lafratta. "We have to remember there is a lot between now and Na­tionals." 
The key to success for this season has been team effort. There are no "superstars" on this squad meaning every player's contribution is equal­ly important to the team. "We're a very team oriented group," Lafratta said. "We like to work and we're motivated, dedicated and com­mitted to tennis and hopefully it will pay off in a National championship." 
On Tuesday, the Irish ad their per­fect record tarnished, losing to a tough Michigan squad. Although the 7-2 score appears discouraging, the games were much closer than past meetings between the two rivals. Since Michigan is a Division I team and not in direct competition with Notre Dame, the loss is not seen as a major setback for the team. 
"They've always been above us, but now they're not that far above us," explained Roemer. 
After Michigan had the match sewn up after the first round of doubles competition, players rallied for the remaining··sets to -give the Wolverines a run for their money. ''I'm proud ofthem," said Petro. "My kids don't give up and somewhere down the road it will pay off."

"These guys have never really let up in trying to find out what they could be. We got an indication of that when it all came together for us at the end of the year." 
Phelps, not making any alibis, mentioned the fact that his squad barely tired after spending much of the last week-ami-a-half on the road. The Irish coach really had no com­plaints about what his team did in

In the tournament, the Irish con­tingcnt was lt:d hy frc:shman Charles Higgs-Coulthard who won the gold medal in the foil. Higgs-Coulthard just did beat out second place finis­hc:r Stefan Kogler of Wayne State with a strong showing in the final round. He is the: first Irish foiler to win a gold since Andy Bonk won one in 1979. 
Sophomore Mike VanderVelden finished 14th for the Irish in a field of 30 foilers. 
Also fencing strong were the sabre men. Sophomore DonJohnson finished third as he was edged out of second place by Brian Keane of Wayne State in the final round. Each finished with 14 points but Keane had more touches in the final match. 
Michael Lofton of New York Uni­versity took first in the sabre with 19 points while junior Mike Janis finished 14th for the Irish. 
In the epee, the Irish showing was began this season with. 
"The young guys now realize what they can do," said Ken Barlow. "This (the NIT) does nothing but give us more confidence." 
Notre Dame returns everyone but Sluby and Cecil Rucker next year, while bringing in five new recruits. Phelps, in fact, thinks this might be his best recruiting class ever. 
IRISH ITEMS -Sluby and Bar­low both were named to the All­Tournament Team along with 
strong tor junior Andy Quaroni who finished 6th with 7 points. Accord­ing to DeCicco, Quaroni was also honored as the outstanding fencer of the year. He was awarded this honor due to his ability and "classic style." 
"After Andy got into the semi­finals, he couldn't win for losing," commented DeCicco. "He didn't fence as well as he was capable of fencing." 
Ettore Blanche of Wayne State, defeated by Quaroni earlier in the season, took first with 18 points. Sophomore Brian St. Clair came in 18th for Notre Dame. 
Individually, three Irish fencers were also named as all-Americans this past week: junior Andy Quaroni, sophomore Don Johnson, and fresh­man Charles Higgs-Coulthard. 
Representing the lady Irish in the women's NCAA Championships was freshman Pia Albertson who finished 
1Oth in the individual competition. 
The Irish end their season third in 
the country with a 19-1 mark, and 
have yet to finish below 8th in the 
country since 1976.
