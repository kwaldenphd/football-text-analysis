Gaddis addresses crowd 
by Dan Luetcher Senior StaffReporter 

"I feel like a vanishing breed which believes the writer should be read and not heard,'' novelist William Gaddis told a near capacity crowd in the Library Auditorium last night. 
The Sophomore Literary Fes­tival's thtrd guest artist enter­tained the crowd with a variety of jokes and quips, and deli­vered his ideas about the role of the writer and the drudgery of writing itself. He also dis­cussed his novels and offered some advice to potential writers attending the presentation. 
Gaddis, author of two mas­sive .novels, Recognitions and }R, opened the evening by commenting that speaking in front of an audience is a rather "virgin experience for me." He stated that his only previous experience with delivering speeches was an accertance speech for the Nationa Book 
award.  He  recalled  that  the  
acceptance  speech  did  not  
please the criucs.  

According to Gaddis there is a tendency today to place the person in the forefront rather than the work. ''The idea of the separation of the writer and his work is something I still cling to,'' Gaddis said. 
''When a book is written, it comes out and should stand on its own," Gaddis claimed. By letting his works stand alone an author attains anonymity. 
Anonymity however does provide Gaddis with some headaches. Golf club manufac­turers and furniture stores have contacted Gaddis informing him of outstanding bills. Gaddis had never been to these stores. The critics, unlike stores, have little trouble recog­nizing him. Gaddis is the type of writer who evokes contro­versy because of his writings. 
A Time magazine reviewer wrote that Gaddis' first book, Reco~nitions, "is one of those erupuons of personal vison that will be argued about without being argued away.'' Other critics call his writing "opaque" or "brilliant". 
''What one does in fiction is operate a confidence game," Gaddis explained. "Perhaps this is why one would not want to expose oneself for fear of being found out,'' he con­tinued. 
Gaddis then moved on to talking about the art of writing itself. ''Part of writing is drud­gery, sheer drudgery,'' Gaddis said. He added a novel must, "grow, it must insist upon being written.'' 
He stated that the rewards of writing may be overblown and if ''one is capable of doing

Committee nominates Coughlinfor SUDirector 
by Brian McFeeters 
The Student Union Steering Committee nominated sophomore Tim Coughlin for the position of SU Director last night. The Student Government Board of Commissioners will confirm or reject the nomination at a meeting tonight. 
Coughlin, now Assistant Social Commissioner, received at least the required four out of five Steering Committee votes after seven applicants wereinterviewedby the committee last night. The official tally of votes was not released, however, in keeping with the Steering Committee's guidelines. 
SU Director Bill Roche indicated that he and the other Steering Committee members were pleased with the decision. Other Committee members include Cultural Arts Commissioner Jerry Perez, Social Commissioner John Bonacci, Services Commissioner Gary Luchini, and Comp­troller Maureen Carney. 
"We feel confident that he (Coughlin)<·can do the job," Roche said. 
If he is approved by the Board, Coughlin, a Flanner resident, said he hopes to use SU to increase services to off-campus residents and co-sponsor more social events with Saint Mary's. He also emphasized that he would try to maintain SU's present role on campus. "I have definite ideas about who I would like for commissioners but I'd rather not make those names public until after the Board's decision,'' Coughlin explained. 
Coughlin was in charge of "Welcome Week" last semester and was involved in the planning of Homecoming, the Snow Sculpture contest, An Tostal and many of the other social events this year, according to Roche.

In one of the closest elections in recent years, new senior class officers were chosen, and run-off candidates were selected yesterday for the sophomore and junior classes. 
The Nicholas Schneeman ticket defeated the Mark Carney ticket in the senior class eclecuon by forty votes, 495 to 
455. The 950 junior votes cast reported approximately 54 percent of next year's Senior class. Schneeman carried twelve residence halls and the off-campus vote, while Carney carried nine halls. 
"We're happier than hell;" Schneeman said. "We thcnwht that if the turnout was over 50 percent we would win." 
He said that his ticket ran on a more conservative platform than their actual intentions, but added taht the ticket ''was sincere about everything in the platform." "We're going to stress social events," he said, adding "We'll stick up for the students, using the senior class office when appropriate.'' 
In the junior class elections, the Tom Behney ticket and the Mark Kelley ticket emerg~d from a five-ucket field and wtll vie for office in a run-off election tomorrow. Behney carried 367 votes, or 35.9 percent while Kelley garnered 212 votes, or 20.7 percent. Of the other contenders, the Ed Callahan ticket carried 14.7 percent, Bob Mangino gar· nered 14.8 percent and Jim Reidman carried 13.9 percent, of the votes cast for junior class officers. 
The junior class election turn­out of 1,020 was the highest class voting total, and repre-­sented approximately 63 per­cent of next year's juniors. 
"I think we ran against some really good opponents," Behney commented. "I thought they all did an excellent job.. Of course. I'm really gratified that we dtd so well. I hope we can hang on · Thurs­day." 
Kelley said, "We have some work to do. I thought it was a re~l good turnout. I'm sur­p~tsed tha~ Behn!!y ha~, such a wtde margm of vtct<?ry. 
All three of the sophomore class tickets collected more than one-fourth of the v<?te. The Steve Bruemmer ttcket earned 404 votes, or 40 percent of the vot~, wit~ the C~ip Gerhardt ttcket nght behmd with 355 votes, good for 35 percent. Fourty-nine votes sc:perat~~ the ~o, and both wtllparttctpate tn the run-off election. 
The Rudy Fernandez ticket finished third in the balloting, with 212 votes, or 25 percent-­not enough to make the run-off. The sophomre class turnout <?f 1, 011 represented approxt­mately 63 percent of next year's sop~omores. . . 
Tu~ Dages, . the vtce-prest­denttal can.dtdate ?n .~he Bruemmer ttcket, satd we didn't know what to expect. I'm a little surprised that only about 1000 freshmen turned out to vote." He sai~ this was "a really good campatgn; the three ticketsoutalotofworkintoit." 
"We're optimistic right 
now," Gerhardt said. "We 
figured that if it came to a 
run-off we'd have a pretty good 
chance. Our job now is to 
campaign a little harder; we 
have a pretty good shot Thurs­
day." ' Mark Woodward, Ombuds­
man election coordinator said. 
there were no violatio~s of 
election rules by any of the 
candidates. 
''There were some problems 
with people tearing down 
posters " he said "but that 
happen~ every year' and wecan't 
do much about that, except 
notify the candidates." 
He did note that the ballot 
box in Grace hall opened ten 
minutes late, but that it stayed 
open for ten extra minutes to 
try to compensate. "By the 
time I called to alleviate the 
problem, the ballot box was 
opened," he said. 
Due to the small turnout by 
off-campus students for the 
sophomore and junior. class 
elections Woodward satd that 
the ope~ hours for the off-
campus ballot box may be 
reduced. 
"I haven't talked to the 
candidates about this yet,'' 
Woodward said, "but I'm going 
to suggest that we keep it open 
from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m." He 
noted that only twelve off-
campus students voted in the 
sophomore and junior class 
elections and only one off­
campus ~tudent voted between 
2 p.m. and 5 p.m. 
"If only twelve people voted, 
it seems silly to keep the ballot 
box open that long. I just don't 
want to waste anyone's time." 


News in brief 
NBC poll shows Americans favor return to draft 
NEW YORK (AP)--Concemed about how well the volunteer ~y is working, American narrowly favor bringing back the draft for the armed forces, an AssocJated Press NBC News poll shows. By a somewhat larifer margin, the public backs the idea of uruversal public servtce for an young Americans. Those Americans most vulnerable to a draft -those aged 18 to 24 -overwhelmingly oppose the idea of mandatory service in the armed forces. The poll, taken Feb. S-6, found 49 percent of the public supported reinstatement of the draft. Forty-three percent oppose such a move. 
NATO agent defects to East Germany with warplan 
BERliN (AP)--A woman employee of NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, has defected to Communist East Germany with war plans of the Western alliance, the East German ne~s agency ADN said yesterday. Ursel Lorenzen, a confidential secretary on the executive staff, crossedinto East Germany Monday, the agency said, without specifying her job at NATO or personal details. "NATO war plans will be released at the appropriate time,'' along with opinions of NATO officials, ADN said, indicating the woman's state­ments would be the source of any disclosure. The woman was quoted as saying that increased "war preparations" by NATO were behind her decision to enter East Germany.

In Vietnam 

Chinese troops declare victory 
BANGKOK, Thailand (AP)  China claimed victory over Viet­nam yesterday, saying it has "exploded the myth of invinci­bility of this Asian Cuba.'' Vietnam disputed the Chinese claim, declared fightin_g was continuing, but said 1t was willing to negotiate once all Chinese troops have been with­drawn. 
Vietnam also challenged China's announcement Monday that it has beagun a withdrawal of troops from Vietnam. How­ever, Vietnam's major ally, the Soviet Union, apparently ac­cepted the Chinese declaration. 
Vietnam said peace talks may begin at the vice foreign ministerial level after all Chi­nese troops have left Vietnam. 
Director Phan Thi Minh of the Vietnamese foreign minis­tyr, said contrary to Peking's announcement of troop with­drawal, ''Chinese soldiers are still occupying a part of Viet­nam's territory. Peking now talks about negotiations and a withdrawal of troops in an

The Vietnamese foreign min­istry, in a broadcast by the 
VoiCe of Vietnam, said Peking was forced to make the with­drawal announcement because of Vietnam's military strength,_ 
the Soviet Union's support of Vietnam, and objections to the 
. war amon~ the Chinese people. Nobilizatton reportedly was ordered in Vietnam, and the Communist party newspaper Nhan Dan call yesterday to prepare to fight so that ' 'every localiry is a battlefield, every estabhshment a fortress and everybody a combatant." 
It was reported in Moscow that 
Vietnam has ordered all foreign embassies in Hanoi to prepare evacuation plans and that a massive citywide effort was under way to dig shelters. 
The Swedish Ambassador to Vietnam, Tom Tscheroings, reached by telephone from Moscow by a Swedish corre­spondent, said the evacuation related orders were handed down Monday by the Vietnam­ese Foreign Ministry. No reason for the orders was given, he said. 
There was speculation among Western observers in Bangkok that the Vietnamese mobiliz­ation might be a propaganda ploy to show Vietnam was not mtimidated.

Compromises may leadto Egyptian-Israelipeace 
JERUSALEM (AP) · Israel 
agreed to three compromises 
proposed by President Caner 
that may break through the 
barriers preventing an Egyp­
tian-Israeli peace treary, Israeli 
sources said yesterday. 
But the sources cautioned that other problems remain unset­tled, and Egypt's response to the U.S. proposals will be pivotal to success. 
The Carter trip was announced Monday in the wake of the president's talks with Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Be­gin. The president will arrive in Cairo tomorrow and flies to Israel Saturday. 

In New York, Begin said he felt euphoric about progress for peace. "There is euphoria, not only in this country, but in Jerusalem and Cairo and throughout the world.'' 
In Cairo, President Anwar Sa­dar met with U.S. National Security Advisor Zbigniew 

Brzezinski to hear the details of Carter's proposals. Sadat's reaction was not immediately known. 
Sources with flrst-hand know­ledge of the proposals, which have not been revealed, said they involved two compromises on linking the treaty to the Palestinian problem and a third on softening language about whether the treaty would super­sede prior d_efens~ agreemen.ts. 
Without dtsclosmg the prectse language of all the U.S. pro­posals, the sources oudmed them as follows: 
Israel agrees to a 12-month non-binding tarset date for completing negotiations on self­rule for the 1.1 million Palestin· ians living on the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
There is however, no deadline for establishing autonomy, but Israel pledges to carry out the plan as quickly as possible. In a second point linking the treaty to the Palestinian prob­lem, Israel agrees to language specifying that the treary does not contradict the Camp David framework for a general Mid­east peace. ­

A clause remains unchanged in the draft sayin~ the treaty will be carried out 'without r~gard to action or inaction by any other party and independently of any instrument external to this treaty. " 
Again, this adds a measure of "linkage" so important to Sa­dat without setting deadlines or penalties for non-compliance, the sources said. The Egyptian leader has been condemned by other Arab states for his unila­teral peace move, so he has pressed for some connecton in the treaty solving the Palestin­ian problem. The third modification has to do do with language in the treaty's "priority clause," which has been modified to satisfy Egypt's objections that the treaty appears to invalidate its earlier defense pacts with Arab states. The proposed com promise softens the wording so both sides can feel their inter­ests are protected. 
Still unresolved is Egypt's de­mand to delay the exchange of ambassadors until the Palestin­ian autonomy plan goes into effect. Israel wants the ex­change to occur nine months after the treaty is signed and the ftrst of the two-stage with­drawal from the Sinai Peninsula is completed. 
Reliable news reports say the United States also agreed to give Israel a $3.5 billion grant to cover the costs of moving their Sinai air bases back to Israel and to guarantee oil supplies.

Gangs murder 800 Moslems in riots 

N'D]AMENA, Chad (AP) . Rioting gangs murdered more than 800 Moslems over the weekend in one of Africa's bloodiest tribal massacres in recent years, officials of this north-central African nation re­portc:-d. 
The killings were in and a!ound Chad's third-largest ctty, Moundou, some 300 miles s~u~h of the capital, N DJamena. Moundou is m the heart of Chad's densely-popu­lated southern region and most of its 4~,000 inhabitants are Christian or Animist blacks speaking French and local dia­lects. Ana mists believe every object has a soul. 
The traders, storekeepers and moneylenders of Moundou nearly all belong to the town's 1,000-strong Arabic-speakin~ Moslem population was practi­cally wiped out and the few survivors fled toward the capital. 
French authorities confirmed the killings and said some 250 French and other Europenas, virtually the entire white popu­lation of Moundou, were evac­uated to N'Djamena Monday in French army convoys. The French sources said the violence was directed exlusively a~ainst the local Moslem mtnority, and no white expatri­ates were molested. 
Diplomatic sources and refu­gees from Moundou said vio-

lent deaths in recent weeks of about 100 black southerners and a rumor that Moslem were plotting to turn Chad into a militant Islamic republic, sparked the weekend violence. 
The sources said ·gangs of black youths surged through Moundou and neighboring set­tlements in a three-day ramp­age, murdering any Moslems they could find, looting the victims' property and destroy­ing their mud-brick homes. 
The government of no of­ficial announcement or com­ment on the Moundou massacre because it has been paralyzed for weeks by an armed con­frontation between Chad's Christian President, Felix Mal­'loum, ahd the Moslem Prime Minister, Hissen Habre. 
More than 2,000 French troops are maintaining an uneasy cease-fue between the hostile forces entrenched in N'Djamena. 
Malloum, Habre and leaders of various breakaway rebel factions were to meet in Kano, in neighboring Nigeria, today in an attemp~ to . settle their dis­putes. Ntgenan troops were expected to arrive in N'Djamena later in the week to help police the cease-fue. 
Troops and police loyal to Malloum stood by without intervening, the sources re­ported. Refugees said the troops, nearly all southereners, sympathized with the rioters but did not participate in the killing. 
Chad officials said the army could not stop the killings because it was hopeles&ly out­numbered by the noters. Most of Malloum's army is deployed in and around N'Djamena, facing Habre's Moslem forces. 
Chad's 4.5 million inhabi­tants are divided almost equally between the Moslem nonh and the Christian or Animist South.

Senior Bar will hold a special benefit Wednesday night in memory of Andy Sowder. Sowder was the senior from Cavanaugh Hall who died last Thur~day of meningirus. 
Fifty percent of the night's · receipts at the bar will be · donated to a scholarship in 
Sowder's name. 
Mike Schlageter, general man­ager ofSenior Bar, originated the benefit idea. Chris Coraggio, a Senior Bar employee, satd that Schlageter feels this type of benefit ''exemplifies what Notre Dame stands for, and he feels very fortunate to be in a position to do this." 
''The planned night would be very helpful for the family and it shows the love and care of the senior class for a marvelous guy," ] ames Roemer, dean of students, commented. 
Roemer said the scholarship was a ''marvelous idea to honor our beloved Andy." He has given his official approval for the benefit, and indicated that he was glad that the seniors had thought of the idea. 
According to Coraggio, Schlageter is happy to help out after the recent tragedy. ' As a

SMC Elections need endorsements 
Gail Darragh, Saint Mary's Student Government Presi­dent, announced las(night that she will present a ~roposal rejecting endorsements for student ~overnment pos1tions to the Student Assembly. The maJority of the Board of Governance, the organization to whom Darragh addressed this statement, responded positively. The Observer believes the reasoning behind this proposal is not sound and the proposal should rejected by both the Board of Governance and other members of the Student Assembly. 
One argument for the proposal states-that Saint Mary's is too small a community to warrant endorsements by individual and separate grou_Ps. However, any organization has the right to voice its opiruon. Anytime a decision is to be made, in anyj son ofgroup, the opiruons of respected r,eople are sought. Althougli Saint Mary's consists of "only' 1800 students, these students have the right to seek opinions in a public and organized manner. It is far better to reveal these opinons openly, according to cenain criteria  the election guidelines · than to force people to privately seek opinions. 
Another reason says it would be unfair for a re~resentative to speak in the name of a body, because the indiVidual's view may not reflect the views of that body. This statement first ignores the reason for representation. Hall, class, and club representatives (officers) are selected for precisely this purpose. Their job is to seek out the V1ews of their constituency and direct it to the proper channel. To state the representanves may not do this is to doubt the integrity of those representatives. 
Secondly, a criteria of the endorsement policy could state that the representatives could endorse candidates only as r~~resentatives and not as a body. For example, hall officers could endorse a candidate, but could not state the hall endorses that candidate. Both these actions would circumvent the problem of misrepresentation 
The absence of logical argument continues in reasons which display lack of confidence in both the Saint Mary's students and the candidates for office. An argut!lent was put fonh that disuni~ in student government could result from publicaton of endorsements and that the ability of students to keep an open and mature mind about endorsements was questionable. 
If disunity in student government results from the publicaton of endorsements, the officers are obviously mcapable of holding their position. Any officer who would entenain the thought of holding a grudge against a group that did not endorse her lacks the emotional stability needed to re.P,resent and lead a body of 1800 students. If such candidates are elected, the effectiveness of student government should be examined. 
While it is true that some students might mistake endorsements for directions it is unlikely that most would do so. College students are capable of making many difficult decisions. It is unlikely that they would blindly follow the endorsement of a peer group without thinking through the matter. 
Finally, the proposal argues against endorsements for the protection of the candidates. 
This reason does not require a rebuttal, for it never puts fonh an argument. Student government election seeks the perso~ best to represent and lead the student body. In declarmg them.selves candidates for election, .these people enter the public forum. They subject themselves to the criticism and evaluation of others. 
The opinions put fonh in endorsements merely state a group's evaluation of the candidates. Any candidate who needs protection from these opinions does not have the self-confidence necessary to hold office. 
The proposal prohibiting endorsements in the Saint Mary's elections is·. unfounded. The problems it forsees can be overcome by election criteria which strongly defmes endorsements as the opinion of a limited group. But it is doubtful that these problems will even exist.

Daley Cried in Heaven 
Ifit rained in Chicago last week, it might have been Mayor Daley crying up in heaven. Crying because the fmallike of his legacy, the late great Chicago Political Machine, had been broken. The Chicago Machine is not 9uite fmished yet, but it is sputtering through 1ts last few dying gasps. When]ane Byrne announced her candidacy for mayor of Chicago sometime ago, most d.i,missed this action as another of her 'rabble-rousing' antics, designed to garner attention. Byrne had a somewhat underserved reputation as a troublemaker. This was due largely to her battles with Chicago businessmen during her term as Chicago's Consumer Sales Commissioner, and her accusation that Mayor Michael Bilandic had 'greased' a deal between striking cab drivers and the cab companies. Very, very few political analysts took her camJ;>aign seriously, and it was generallycons1dered that she would be destroyed in the primary by Bilandic. 
This assessment .Proved to be basically true for most of the campatgn. Although Byrne attacked the machine and many of its faults, she found it quite difficult to get any media covera(i.e or consideration. This pattern continued until this Winter. Then the snow came. 
Chicago was decimated by two major snow­storms this winter. On both occasions (both in ] anuary), the city was paralyzed and virtually closed for several days. When the city be~an operating again, many Chica~oans were left out in the cold' by the city administration's bungling of snow removal operations. Many streets were never plowed. In an effon to get public transportation running on schedule, many stops were omitted, and many riders were left stranded at the stop as the bus or train sped by. Then came the controversy over the awarding of city contracts to what appeared to be favored bidders, es_Pecially former deputy Mayor Kenneth Sam. Ironically, Sain had a snow removal contract, and this only added to the voters' ire. 
These events, however, probably could have been 'weathered' by Bilanruc had he not dealt with the dissatisfacnon of the populace in such a high-handed manner. The voters in Chicago probably tired of watching TV news programs on which Bilandic and other officials praised themselves and their efforts in removing the 

snow and gettin~ the city operating, while their 
streets were buned in 4 feet of snow. Bilandic 
also showed his arrogance when he answered his 
critics by comparing himself to]esus Christ and 
other figures in history who were ''martyred'' by 
unfair criticism. Chicagoans fmally tired of ~0 
years of insensitive beauracracy in government, 
and decided to take action. 
These events have significance in that last week's primary was the most imponant happening in Chicago in the last ~0 years. It signals many changes. The administration is now accountable for its behaviors and actions. The populace will no longer sit still and watch while the power elite manipulates the city for political and personal gain. 
Last week's primary has national significance also. Democrats can no longer count on Chicago to counter the rest of largely Republican Illinois in state and national elections. There is also a possibility now for Chicago itself to return to a real two-party system. Perhaps there 
will be a true election Tuesday April 3rd, instead of the usual anticlimactic confirmation of the Democratic nominee as mayor. 
] ane Byrne is to be saluted for her efforts. In Chicago, more than anywhere else in this country, the old cliche "You can't fight city hall" held true. Byrne has destroyed that myth, at least as far as Chicago is concerned. Whether she wins the general election or not, she has made her mark on Chica~o history. It is quite ironic, and smacks of poet1c justice, that the last political machine, and perhaps the most arrogant, sexist, and racist of them all, should be brought down by a woman. 
In giving out salutations, however, the most important group of all cannot be forgotten. The people of Chicago have endured the problems brought on by machine politics for too many years. The neighborhoods are no longer just rubber-stamp bodies for fast-talking politicians. The administration must heed the will of the people, and consider them in all decisions. The government of Chicago finally consists of all 3 million residents, instead of 40-odd favored aldermen, and a dictatorial mayor. The people are to be saluted for fmally putting their collective foot down and saying "Enough is enough''. The people have taken their city back.

Indeed, the piece is wonderfully lofty and poetic interpretation of the circus. Chagall stuck to a very naive, simplistic style, and carried off the task with his usual sophistication. He attained the flowing rhythm through a lush use of bright, showy, primary colors, and gave the painting an extra dimension through his generous use of impasto. 
One of the most interesting, and certainly the tour de force of the pieces on display, is Picasso's "Le M1roir", which is a look at that artist's prime period of the early 1930's. Picasso was m the midstof retreatin~ from abstrac­tionism and his Cubist experimen­tation, and went far beyond both ~enres in his own lively interyreta­uons. The "master of styles' pro­duced about twenty paintings during this period, and all of them are, as is "Le Miroir," vitally important. 
Like the Chagall, this Picasso is on extended loan to the university from the Gustav Stern Foundation. It is, quite simply, a lady stretched before a mirror--but then, one can never quite so succinctly describe a Picasso.

Gaddis next tried to answer

Gaddis, one doesn't write for reviewers because they don't sell or hinder the sale of books. One doesn't write for the academians because they tend to read interpretations into novels that really don't exist.$ 
"When one writes, there has to be some problem which one wants to solve--some central obsession.'' He answered the question of who to write for by paraphrasing fellow writer Sam Butler: ''I write to s;ty some­thing and to have' something to read in my old age." 
Gaddis provided a fresh out­look to the world of writing but by way of eluding he moved into a more abstract discussion. 
He advised students to concen­

''It often seems that every­thing ends in heartbreak, dis­appointment or failure,'' Gaddis stated. ''This should not disillusion you, but what is really demoralizing is failing at something you originally didn't think was worth doing at all. ''

Fencers win three meets 
by Paul Mullaney Asszstant Sports Editor 

With the sweep of three weekend opponents, Notre Dame completed its fourth suc­cessive undefeated fencing sea­son by completing the 1979 season with a 20-0 mark. 
After defeating Bowling Green, 26-1, on Friday, the Irish travelled to Cleveland on Saturday to hand Case Western Reserve and Oberlin College respective 20-7 losses. Coach Mike DeCicco's swordsmen end the campaign with lOS consecutive victones, the long­est streak ever in collegiate fencing history. 
But DeCicco and his fencers are no longer concerned with undefeated seasons and win­ning streaks. Their foremost concern centers around the upcoming tournaments, for which they've. spent the entire season prepanng. 
"This is the stretch of the season that we've been waiting for," noted DeCicco. "all year long we've seen that as a team, and especially depth-wise, we are good as any one in the country." 
"Now we'll get a chance to compare our best with the best of all the schools in the coun­t '·' 
ryNotre Dame will defend its Great Lakes Fencing Championship title of 1978 this coming weekend at the annual midwestern afffair. To be held at Michgan-Dearborn on Friday and Saturday, the Irish will send their top two representa­
tives in each of three weapons --. [Continued on page 9] 
SMC fencers take three to close regular season 
foil, sabre and epee. 

While foil and epee are not definitely decided as of yet, there is little doubt of who will represent Notre Dame's sabre squad. Senior captain Mike Sullivan and junior Chris Lyons are at the top of the list in this weapon. 
Sullivan, a three-time All­American and two-time sabre gold-mealist, is 42-2 on the season, and finished his regu­lar-season Notre Dame career with an outstanding mark of 183-4 (.979), best ever in Notre Dame annals. 
Lyons, in his second varsity season has posted a 37-6 mark for the two-time defending national champions. 
While Andy Bonk is ~retty well assured of seeing actton in foil this weekend, the other spot is between weapon captain Steve Salimando and Sophomore Ray Benson. Salimando, 26-1 on the season, is currently suffering from a groin injury suffered last week­end. If he is unable to fence, Benson will probably carry a 25-10 mark into t!J.e Great Lakes competition. 
In epee, the two spots will be between senior M1ke Carney and Mike Schermoly and junior Tom Cullum. Schermoly has the best season mark at 33-11, while Cullum is 30-12 and Carney is 27-15. 
"We've done well all year long--better perhaps than we thought we would do," added DeCicco. "But we can't leave well enough alone. there's a lot yet to be accomplished.'' 
The Saint Mary's varsity fencing team finished their regular season play this week­end with three victories as they defeated Bowling Green, 
Oberlin College and Western Reservf:.  Case- 
Rose ann  Enyedy,  a  sopho­ 

more fencer and spokeswoman for the team, said, ''This is the first time in the history of the Saint Mary's fencing team that we have had a winning! season.'' The Belles ended the' season with a 9-5 record.

Badgers blitz Irish icers, 11-5 
by Brian Beglane Sports Writer 
MADISON--The Notre Dame hockey team gave up three goals 10 the frrst four m10utes of the game to Wisconsin, and never managed to climb back, as the Irish dropped their first game of the WCHA playoffs to the Badgers, 11-5 . 
With Wisconsin winning this first game by six goals, all the Badgers have to do is lose by less than six goals in tonight's

ND swim team sets five new records 
by Michael Ortman Sports Writer 
A few years ago, there was a sign which hung outside the home locker room in Notre Dame Stadium. It read, ''What tho the odds be, great or small, Notre Dame men will give their all." This past weekend, with the odds stacked heavily against them, the Irish swim­mers gave their all. 
No, it wasn't a miraculous come-from-behind victory. It wasn't even close. But Dennis Stark's tankers gave every ounce of strength they could muster, right down to the very end. 
The setting was the Midwest Invitational Swim Meet. Teams from five different schools tra­velled to Bloomington, Ill. to join host Illinois State in what turned out to be a terribly lopsided event. When the water settled, Western Ken­t.Ycky and Eastern Kentucky were perched high atop the heap with 446 and 443 points respectively. The Irish f10ished sixth with 180.· 

But their position in the team standings did not truly reflect the outstanding individual efforts made by the Irish swim­mers. Countless seasonal and individual best times were accounted for in the three-day­
long meet, including an amaz­ing total of five new varsity records, one of which was set in the final event of the season finale. 
"I really wish they didn't have to keep team totals," said coach Stark. "Our score cer­tainly doesn't show how well we swam. It was an incredibly fast meet -much faster than I had anticipated.'' 
The Irish records began to crumble on Friday, the first day of competition. Freshman Michael Hilger started the weekend off nght for the Irish. In the afternoon preliminary heats Hilger clocked a 4: 53.8 in the 500-yard fr,eestyle! breaking ] ohn Komora s vars1ty record of 4:54.5, set last season. 
Friday evening, Pat LaPlat­ney continued thi~ rec<;>rd breaking pattern while swtm­ming the backstroke leg of the 400-yard medley relay. His time of 55. 1 knocked a full second off of the varsity record which LaPlatney himself had set just two weeks earlier at Bowling Green. 
Following Saturday's record­less performance, the frrst, second and even third place slots were well out of reach for

NCAA Midwest 

Arkansas couldoust Sycamores 
Finally Indiana State will have to stop saying the whole world is against them and start playing basketball. 
While the Sycamores had trouble with pollsters throughout the year, they have finally reached· the number-one ranking they had claimed was theirs since midseason. They have also been treated kindly by the NCAA committee in charge of pairings as they were tabbed as the number-one seed in the meekest division in the tournament. 
] oining the only undefeated in the country is number-two seeded Arkansas, Louisville and Texas. The rest of the teams are not ranked in the top twenty but everyone in this division is a "Cinderella" candidate. 
While Indiana State is the favorite on paper, Arkansas has a lot of things going for them that may make the difference 10 a close game. 

The Razorbacks have played the toughest schedule as the winners of a much improved Southwest Conference. Eddie Sutton's team has the advantage of being to the Final Four as they captured the west division last year and recorded victories over UCLA and Notre Dame. But most importantly, Arkansas has been a hot team lately. Ranked sixth ahead of Duke in the UPI poll, the Razorbacks sport a 23-4 ~ecord desp-tte a rough start due to the graduation of standouts Ron Brewer and Marvin Delph. 
Indiana State still must be the sentimental choice, as was Cal-State Fullerton last year. The Larry Bird-led Sycamores can match up to the Sidney Moncrief-led Razorbacks, but experience and playing tough opposition can make the difference in a do-or-die situation. 
Louisville has been a big disappointment this

season. "Doctors of Dunk" were rated to be one of the best in preseason, but have continually faltered in big games. Although they captured the Metro Seven regular season title, they lost in the post-season tournament to Virginia Tech, who also sneaks into the Midwest Region. The Cardinals last were seen being pummeled by the Russians on national television and while they are as talented as anyone, Denny Crum just has not found the formula to make them a big winner. 
Fifteenth-ranked Texas is the only other viable contender. Tying Arkansas for the r~gular season title, the Longhorns got knocked off in the post-season tournament.

Reg-ionals, as even teams like Virginia Tech, whtch reached the Eastern Regional Champions game three years ago could gain national attention. But when the dust has cleared in Cincinnati, the ''tournament-tested-tough'' crew from Arkansas should find themselves in the Final Four for the second straight year and Larry Bird and crew will go back to being normal old Hoosiers.
