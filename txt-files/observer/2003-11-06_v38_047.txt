VOLUME 38: ISSUE 47 THURSDAY. NOVEMBER 6, 2003 NDSMCOBSERVER.COM STUDENT SENATE 
Group asks ND to form Women's Center 
By MAUREEN REYNOLDS Associate News Editor 
The Student Senate unani­mously passed a resolution Wednesday asking the University to "commit the appropriate resources to the creation and maintenance of a 
Women's Resource Center." 
The resolution addresses what Senators perceive to be a large hole in the University's services available to students, acknowledging that many of the top 20 institutions in the country have their own women's resource centers sponsored, staffed and funded by the universities themselves. 
Pangborn Senator Kaitlyn Redfield presented this resolu­tion to the Senate, along with a separate statement regard­ing a women's resource center at Notre Dame. 
"It is widely acknowledged that Notre Dame's gender relations are below the social­ly acceptable standards required for fostering the sup­portive community needed to encourage student growth," the statement reads. 
"Notre Dame has an ever­increasing responsibility to educate its students on mat­ters of gender relations," it says. 
Currently, there is a student­run club addressing women's issues, but it cannot meet the needs of students as well as a University-sponsored facility would, Redfield said. 
Redfield cited the University's Multicultural

University considers limiting business majors 
By BETH ERICKSON News Writer 
Due to the steadily increasing number of undergraduate busi­ness majors at Notre Dame, University Provost Nathan Ha.tch and the deans of the University's colleges are currently discussing several structural changes to the Mendoza College of Business. 
The College of Business cur­rently enrolls 1,769 undergradu­ate business majors, constituting 32 percent of all undergraduate majors. This proportion is extremely high relative to the average percentage of under­graduate business majors at Notre Dame's top 20 peer institu­tions -7 percent. 
'There has been an increasing trend in the number of under­graduate business majors," vice president and associate provost John Affieck-Graves said. "It is our responsibility to explore this and determine whether this fits with our mission statement and the overall goals and aspirations of the University." 
Many feel that the size of the undergraduate business pro­gram at Notre Dame may conflict

fACULTY SENATE 
Chair to step down 
By BETH ERICKSON News Writer 
Faculty Senate members dis­
cussed the election of a new 
chairperson and the dearth of 
library resources in the group's 
November session held 
Wednesday. 
Elections for a new chairper­son will be held during the Senate's December meeting, over which Vice-Chair Jeremy Fein, director of the Environmental Molecular Science Institute, will preside. This election has been necessi­tated by the decision of Chair John Robinson, associate dean of the Law School, to resign from his post due to medical reasons. 
Robinson expressed hope for the continued success of the Senate during his absence. "[The Senate] still has a long way to go before it has proven itself," he said. 
He said that his principal goal as chairman has been to show that, contrary to the beliefs of much of the faculty, "the inter­ests of the administration and · the faculty do converge." In his experience, the administration highly values the interests of the University and the opinions of faculty members, Robinson said. 
The University would be the worse for lack of the Senate, which strengthens the voice of the faculty, he said. 
Jennifer Younger, director of University Ubraries, was invited by the Academic Affairs Committee to address the Senate concerning the current alloca­tion of and future outlook for library resources. 

Younger informed the Senate of the pressing need of addition­al funds for the library materials budget. "No [department] has too much money," she said, but some departments are in direr straits than others. 
Throughout the past three years, the materials budget has been flat, with increases only in endowment income. This year,

INSIDE COLUMN 
Greatness at 

what price? 
I certainly agree that Notre Dame must strive for higher academic stan­dards and greater intellectual curiosity, as recent debates have indicated. 
I have to ask, however, "At what price?"
It does worry me Lauren Beck ifstudents fail to see the value of Associate learning. But, what Viewpoint I fear more is that Editor in its quest to ascend in academ­ic ranking, Notre Dame might lose the type of well-rounded students that make it unique and make me proud to attend this University rather than any other top-20 school. 
Here, I can pray, party and study with my friends; discuss politics, athletics, philosophy, relationships and religion with them. And that is the essence of Notre Dame's identity. 
Looking back, I do wish I had attended more lectures, read more newspapers, done more research and met with more professors. 
But regardless, the majority of stu­dents I know-of various majors -are indeed "academically engaged." They have used their time at Notre Dame not merely to attain a diploma or a job but to grow in both wisdom and knowledge, both inside and outside the classroom. 
Notre Dame professors deserve a great deal of credit as well. I have encountered professors who are capable of engaging students and encouraging us to pursue and challenge ideas. · 
That said, I do not want to be compla­cent. There are improvements that should be and can be made at Notre Dame. 
I'd like to see greater activism. I'd like to bring students and professors togeth­er more often. I'd like to hear more stu­dents challenge theories and opinions in class. I'd like to combat the notion that grades matter most and to foster a greater passion for pure learning. 
I hope the University seriously consid­ers these issues, perhaps putting togeth­er a task force of students, professors and administrators to probe them fur­ther. 
Please, make the improvements that need to be made in order to keep Notre Dame's standards high, its curriculum rigorous and its students motivated. 
But please, do not neglect what is right with this University. Please, do not ignore the other vital points of its mis­sion as a Catholic institution. 
Notre Dame faces a challenge that grows greater year by year -can we attain status as a top research universi­ty, recruit top professors and enroll top students while still retaining our long­standing identity as one of the nation's premier Catholic institutions? 
I can only hope that as administrators meet this challenge, they do not feel forced to choose to sacrifice one for the other. 
And I can only pray that, ifsuch a choice becomes inevitable, they strongly consider this University's heritage and character and continue to attract prom­ising students who are passionate not only about academics but also about service, faith, social life and leadership -the type of students who have made and who continue to make Notre Dame the quality school that it is.

NEW YORK -A cancer survivor burst into tears Wednesday when she testi­fied that Rosie O'Donnell sug­gested she was lying about goings-on at her now-defunct magazine and told her liars get cancer. 
Cindy Spengler, who was head of marketing at "Rosie" magazine, said O'Donnell made the remark after a meeting to discuss the maga­zine's problems. Spengler said O'Donnell told her that her silence in the meeting was tantamount to lying.

'Splderman' ends crane protest In London LONDON -An angry father in a Spiderman cos­
tume climbed down from a 120-foot crane Wednesday, ending a five-day protest that snarled traffic in London's busy financial district. 
David Chick, 36, descended the crane beside London's Tower Bridge at about 4 p.m., cheered by a group of mostly male supporters. 
Chick, a father of one from Sussex county in southern England, scaled the crane in a bid to draw attention to the plight of fathers who are divorced or separated from their wives and denied access to their children.

Retired U.S. Marine Corps Maj. Gen. James McMonagle, a decorated combat leader in Vietnam and 1953 Notre Dame graduate, will receive the Rev. William Corby, C.S.C., Award during a halftime ceremony at the Notre Dame-Navy football game Saturday. 
The Corby Award is presented annually by the Notre Dame Alumni Association to a gradu­ate who has distinguished him­self or herself in military serv­ice. 
During his 35-year active-duty career, McMonagle served in Korea, Lebanon and Vietnam, where he held major combat command positions with the Third Marine Division. He was awarded the Legion of Merit with Combat V and a Gold Star. 
McMonagle held a full range of military staff positions and directed a variety of training and development courses and programs. His career included three roles as commanding gen­eral -at Camp Pendleton, Calif.. the First Marine Expeditionary Force and the Marine Corps Recruit Depot at Parris Island, S.C. Also a direc­tor of personnel, McMonagle received the Distinguished Service Medal when he retired in 1988 .. 
McMonagle has served as an adviser for several law firms in military personnel cases and a volunteer for an outreach pro­gram that provides manual labor to improve the quality of life for children in the Nazareth Orphanage in Tecate, Mexico. In addition, he is a trustee for Devil Pups Inc., a non-profit Marine Corps youth summer program at Camp Pendleton. 
McMonagle and his wife. Carol, reside in Vista, Calif., and have three sons who also are Notre Dame graduates. 


Lectures center on O'Connor, Percy 
Talks to feature works oftwo noted authors 
Special to The Observer 
The works of Walker Percy and Flannery O'Connor will be the subject of a lecture series sponsored by Notre Dame's Center for Ethics and Culture Nov. 10-13. 
The title of the series, "A Reason to Write: Two Catholic Novelists," is taken from O'Connor, who once wrote, "I feel that if I were not a Catholic, I would have no rea­son to write, no reason to see. no reason ever to feel horri­fied or even to enjoy any­thing." 
According to Jennifer Bradley, a Notre Dame senior and organizer of the series, "We hope to better acquaint the Notre Dame community with the lives and work of Flannery O'Connor and Walker Percy, two figures who loom large in American Catholicism's recent past. To that end, we have put together a set of lectures which will not only each be very good indi­vidually, but that will, when taken as a whole, offer a rich and full account of the impor­tance of these Catholic writ· ers." 
The series will include four lectures, all beginning at 7:30 
p.m. in Room 138 of DeBartolo Hall. The first lec­ture will occur Nov. 10 and feature Ralph Wood, University Professor of Theology and Literature at Baylor University, on "Why Jesus Throws Everything Off Balance: Flannery O'Connor and Catholic Culture."

outdated 

Registrar looks into ways to update process 
By MATT SMEDBERG 
News Writer 

As Notre Dame becomes an increasingly electronic cam­pus, certain offices, most notably the Office of the Registrar, seem to fall behind technologically, still requiring antiquated procedures such as requiring multiple signa­tures on documents for pur­poses as simple as cross-list­ing a class or waiving prereq­uisites. 
Class registration by Irishlink was the first step in computerizing the Registrar's functions. The next large step, according to Associate Registrar Lora Spaulding, will be the introduction of the Renovare database software currently under development for the University by SCT Corporation. The introduc­tion of the software is tenta· tively scheduled for 18 months from now, Spaulding said. Renovare will form a central database to be used for purposes of financial aid, administration, human resources and methods of interaction between students and the University. 
Spaulding said her office has looked at various ways to improve and electronicize "workflow," the process by which information, whether print or electronic, is moved between campus offices. The registrar's office concluded that there was no effective way to computerize the sys­tem to complete improve· ments before installation of the Renovare system. In the meantime, specific processes have been examined for ways that they could be stream­lined. 
"The forms which students find take most time are aca­demic program forms, such as those used to add or drop a major, and exemption forms which students must get filled out if they do not have the ordinary require­ments for a class," Spaulding said. 
Those students most prone to use exemption forms are transfer students and those from Saint Mary's taking Notre Dame courses. In many cases, lrishlink will not rec­ognize the courses that these students already have on their record as sufficient for the requirements. 
Generally, processes that only require approval from one person -such as approval for overload -are those that the Registrar's Office has successfully streamlined. Pro.cesses that require input from more than one person typically remain un-computerized and likely appear to remain so for at least 18 months, Spaulding said.

the library has subsisted only via ad hoc money furnished by the Provost, she said. 
The basic allocations of library resources were determined in the 1970s and have only been "tweaked" since. 
During this fiscal year, the library expects to see an overall decrease in library materials funds of $330,000. Concurrent with this decrease, future costs are expected to steadily rise. 
Last year, the library attempt­ed to alleviate the deficit by car­rying out a 6 percent decrease in commitments across every subject area. They also institut­ed polices canceling paper ver­sions of journals received in dig­ital form and purchasing trade paper bound books rather than hardcover editions. 
The University Libraries has published a strategic plan with which it will approach future challenges. This plan is based on "where we want the library to be in 20 years," Younger said. 
"The strategic plan is clearly based on a growth of financial resources, however," she said.

Bush bans abortion procedure 
Abortion-rights. advocates file suits to block controversial 'partial-birth' bill 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON President Bush signed into law the most far-reaching abortion restrictions in three decades Wednesday, an emotionally charged measure already chal­lenged in three federal courts. 
A federal judge in Nebraska called the law "highly suspect" and issued a temporary order block­ing it from applying to four abortion-rights doctors who filed suit. 
After years of frustration, legal setbacks and two presidential vetoes, hun­dreds of anti-abortion leaders rose in applause when Bush promised to vigorously defend the con­stitutionality of the law, known by its supporters as a "partial birth abortion" ban. 

"For years a terrible form of violence has been directed against children who are inches from birth while the law looked the other way," Bush told reli­gious leaders, members of Congress and other abor­tion foes at a signing cere-· mony at the Ronald Reagan Building.

KOREAN PENINSULA 
U.S., allies stop nuclear projects 
Associated Press 
SEOUL, South Korea -The United States and its key allies agreed Wednesday to suspend con­struction of two nuclear power plants in North Korea, saying that the energy-starved communist state won't get them unless it gives up its nuclear weapons program. 
The move seems likely to kill the $4.6 billion power plants project, because the Bush administration opposes it and officials from the United States, South Korea, Japan and the European Union have agreed that a unanimous decision would be needed to resume con­struction. 
The Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, a U.S. based consortium, has been build­ing two light-water reactors as part of the 1994 accord between Washington and Pyongyang in which North Korea promised to freeze and eventually dismantle its suspected nuclear weapons devel­opment. 
But the deal went sour in October 2002 when U.S. officials said North Korea admitted to running such a weapons program. 
The deal had been part of U.S.­led international efforts to per­
suade the impoverished communist nation to abandon its nuclear weapons ambitions in return for energy aid and other economic benefits. But the Bush administra­tion says the project has lost its tactical merit because Pyongyang has been running a secret nuclear weapons program flouting the agreement. 
The four-member executive board of the KEDO met in New York on Monday and Tuesday and discussed suspending the project. The board said it would make its final announcement before Nov. 21 after consulting with the member nations' governments.

Mission Sunday 
The Mission of Jesus is ours 
by Fr. Richard Warner Director, Office of Campus Ministry 
This weekend, Notre Dame will observe Mission Sunday, an annual moment when we reflect on the mission ofJesus, the mission of the Church and our mission, which are one and the same. It also offers us an opportunity to learn about and assist the mission character of the Congrega­tion ofHoly Cross. . 
As Jesus commends his spirit into the Father's hands, his death conquers death. After his resurrection, the Holy Spirit moves freely among his disciples. And the mission ofJesus and of the Spirit become"the mission of the Church (cf Catechism of the Catholic Church, 730). At the moment of his ascension, Jesus tells his closest followers to preach the Good News to people ofevery nation and tongue and race ofevery time and place. Through the baptism they accept in the name of our Triune God, they will be enabled through the witness they bear and the sacramental life they share to participate in the mission ofJesus. 
Some believers participate directly in spreading the faith throughout the world by serving in places where the Church is young, such as East Africa, or where it is long established but facing the threat ofsects as in Central America. 
The Congregation of Holy Cross was founded in the years following the French Revolution as a group ofyoung men and women called to be catechists and educators at home and beyond their country's borders. Father Sarin arrived in New

When the founder of Holy Cross was told that it was likely that his Congregation would only receive papal approval if the Congregation would accept responsibility for the mission in Bengal, a group of Holy Cross religious were sent from France to what is today Bangladesh in 1853. No Congregation had been able to make a go of this mission because of the extraordinarily difficult circumstances. But this year, Holy Cross will celebrate the I 50th anniversary of that continuous foundation. Bangladesh has been a holy place because of the many religious who lived heroic lives there and a significant number who died or were killed. 
Obviously the Holy Cross ministry at Notre Dame is not so dramatic. But the root ofour commitment is the same, because the continuation of the mission ofJesus through the Church is the welcome challenge we share with them. 
Mission is not just the work ofordained and vowed men and women. It is the work ofall the baptized. Each of us shares this mission when we bear witness to Jesus as his followers by what we say and do, and by the way we try to live out what we believe. We share in the mission of Jesus when we share in the rich sacramental life of the Church together. Through service and tutoring and care for people who are poor and in need, we preach the Good News. 
This weekend is a special time for us to be grateful for our faith, and to continue to dedicate ourselves to live as Jesus did, to teach as Jesus did, to serve the most needy as Jesus did and to extend the mission ofJesus to all those people who enter our lives. 
Mission Sunday activities during these days include special collections for Holy Cross missions in the Basilica and in the residence halls this weekend, the Notre Dame Folk Choir Concert Saturday at 8:30 p.m. in the Basilica, and next Wednesday's "The Gospel according to Bono"coffeehouse at 10:00 p.m. at the Coleman-Morse Center.

IN BRIEF 
Manufacturing climbs in Sept., Oct. 
WASHINGTON -Orders to U.S. factories 
rebounded in September, rising by 0.5 percent 
in another signal pointing to an economic 
resurgence. 
That marked a turnaround from the 0.3 per­cent dip reported for August, according to revised figures released by the Commerce Department on Wednesday. That decline for August turned out to be not as deep as the 0.8 percent drop the government previously reported. 
September's performance was slightly weak­er than the 0.6 percent increase economists were forecasting. Gains were led by big-ticket goods including cars, machinery and furni­ture. 
In a more forward-looking report, manufac­turing in October posted its highest level of activity in nearly four years, the Institute for Supply Management said this week. 
Toyota posts $4.88 earnings 
TOKYO-Japan's largest automaker Toyota Motor Corp. reported unexpectedly strong growth in its profit for the first half of the fis­cal year on thriving overseas sales and said its profits, revenue and vehicle sales should beat its earlier forecasts for the full year. 
Toyota said Wednesday net earnings rose 23 percent to 524.4 billion yen ($4.81 billion) for the April-September period from 425.8 billion yen a year earlier. 
The results beat analyst expectations for a net profit of between 412.6 billion yen and 
440.0 billion yen ($3.78 billion and $4.04 bil­lion) as surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires. 
Cisco profits surge to $1.098 
SAN JOSE, Calif. -Cisco Systems Inc. post­ed higher sales and profits for its fiscal first quarter Wednesday, the strongest indication yet that corporate spending on networking equipment is rebounding after two years of declines. 
For the three months ended Oct. 25, Cisco earned $1.09 billion, or 15 cents per share, compared with a profit of $618 million, or 8 cents per share, for the same period last year. 
Sales jumped 5.3 percent, to $5.1 billion frcm $4.85 billion. 
Martha Stewart defends herself

NEW YORK -Martha

"What I did was not

Asked whether she ever

The maven of gracious living goes to trial Jan. 12 on charges she obstructed justice and lied to investiga­tors about her sale of ImClone Systems stock on Dec. 27, 2001. 
The government contends she was tipped that the family of ImClone founder Sam Waksal was trying to sell its shares. A negative government report the next day sent ImClone shares tumbling. 
Stewart, 62, maintains she had a standing order to sell the stock if it fell below a certain price.

NYSE head announces new slate 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -New York Stock Exchange interim chairman John Reed nominated a set of candidates Wednesday for a trimmed-down NYSE board intended to improve regulation and sweep away conflicts of interest. 
The nominations are part of a package of reforms proposed by Reed, who joined the NYSE in late September after former chairman Dick Grasso resigned amid outrage over his $188 million compensation package. 
The proposals call for representa­tives of the securities industry or directors who were involved in approving Grasso's compensation package to step down. 
The current 27 -member board 

would .be replaced by a board of six to 12 members who will oversee regulation and compensation. A separate executive panel of the securities industry would handle operations, such as listing stan­dards. 
"I think this board will serve the New York Stock Exchange well, and I think it will serve the American public well," Reed said. 
At Reed's request, a majority of the current directors have already submitted their resignations, which will take effect if the proposals are approved by the NYSE's 1,366 members. Members are being asked to approve the plan by Nov. 18. 
The nominees include two current NYSE board members, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Herb Allison, chair­man of the teachers pension fund TIAA-CREF. 
Other nominees are Euan Baird, former chairman of oilfield services concern Schlumberger Ltd.; Marshall Carter, former head of State Street Bank; Shirley Ann Jackson, president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; James McDonald, former chief executive of Rockefeller & Co.; Robert Shapiro, former chairman of agricultural and chemical giant Monsanto Co.; and Sir Dennis Weatherstone, for­mer CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase. 
Other proposals include requiring the exchange to disclose informa­tion such as the amount of compen­sation for the CEO and top manage­ment officials. Companies listed on the exchange already have such disclosure requirements.

Business 
continued from page 1 
with the University's mission of education in the liberal arts. 
"There seems to be support for limits on majors in Business from a variety of fronts," Mark Roche, dean of the College of Arts and Letters, said. "I am optimistic about our addressing the chal­lenge, which should bring us clos­er to our ideals as a Catholic lib­eral arts university." 
Carolyn Woo, dean of the Mendoza College of Business, said the business program itself in no way diverges from Notre Dame's Catholic mission. 
The difficulty lies in the pro­gram's limited capacity to serve its large number of students, Woo said. While the college enrolls one-third of all undergraduate students, it only employs one­eighth of the University's full-time 
faculty. ''It is this severe imbalance that causes the problem," Woo said. 
In the past 10 years, the num­ber of undergraduate business majors has increased by approxi­mately 20 percent. 
Enrollment has since reached a plateau, remaining relatively con­sistent for the past five years. This plateau can be partially attributed to a recent policy that dictates no more than 18 percent of business intents shall be admitted to each freshman class. 
Business has become the most popular undergraduate major at Notre Dame because of word of mouth and role modeling, Woo said. 
"Most people can imagine themselves succeeding iri busi­ness," she said. "Most people work in business, period." 
It is an interesting major with a strong national reputation and a strong placement program, Woo said. 
"I think that it is well taught, and the highly passionate faculty care a lot about students suc­ceeding," she said. 
The strategy with which this issue will be approached has not yet been chosen. 
"We are still at the stage of exploring the problem and deter­mining why we are so different from other universities," Affieck­Graves said. 
Several possible approaches to the problem are under review: 
+ The College is exploring the possibility of creating a business minor. 
However, shifting capacity to accommodate minors may prove difficult. Woo said. If the college does opt to offer a minor and the number of majors does not decrease, this plan will backfire and require even more faculty, she said. 
Undergraduate business stu­dents have shown little interest in a business minor program, Woo said. 
+ The College may improve its 
capacity to meet the level of enrollment of its undergraduate program by hiring additional instructors. 
+ The College is considering capping undergraduate enroll­ment. 
All other top undergraduate business programs in the nation have extremely competitive appli­cation processes, Woo said. However, she does not envision a facile implementation of such an application process at Notre Dame. 
"No one at Notre Dame is unable to succeed as a business major," Woo said. "It is not a mat­ter of whether students qualify." 
Chao-Shin Liu, professor of accounting, said that, although it is not desirable for a liberal arts university to enroll too many business majors, "it is also [Notre Dame's) tradition that students are free to choose any college without restrictions [unlike Michigan and many other univer­sities.]" 
In the event of an enrollment cap in the College of Business, the University must "ensure that budgetary strategies are in place to deal with unintended conse­quences, such as an overabun­dance of students in certain col­leges or departments," Roche said. "While some departments in Arts and Letters, for example, could absorb more students, oth­ers are close to their capacity to meet student needs." 
+ Business students may be encouraged to pursue other majors. 
According to Woo, this is a University-level issue. Guidance must be provided by the University and the other Colleges to promote alternate majors. 
"Personally, I think a very pop­ular College of Business is not the problem," Liu said. "The problem is why some other colleges become so unpopular."

Ridgway confesses to killing 48 
Congress cuts funds 
Associated Press 
SEATTLE --Uttering the word "guilty" 48 times with chilling calm, Gary Leon Ridgway admitted Wednesday he is the Green River Killer and confessed to strangling four dozen women over two decades -"so many women I have a hard time keeping them straight." 
"Choking is what I did, and I was pretty good at it," the 54­year-old former truck-factory employee said in papers sub­mitted as part of his plea bar­gain. 
Ridgway, a short figure with glasses, thinning hair and a sandy mustache, pleaded guilty to more murders than any other

prison without parole for one of the most baffiing and disturb­ing serial killer cases the nation has ever seen. 
For a half-hour, he listened in court with an utter lack of expression as his own account­ing of how he picked up each victim and where he dumped the body was read aloud. In the most matter-of-fact way, he confirmed the details, respond­ing "yes" over and over in a clear but subdued voice. 
"I wanted to kill as many women as I thought were pros­titutes as I possibly could," he said in a statement that was read aloud in court by a prose­cutor and opened an extraordi­nary window on the twisted mind of a serial killer. He also said: "I killed so many women I have a hard time keeping them straight." 
He said he left some bodies in "clusters" and enjoyed driving by the sites afterward, thinking about what he had done. He said he sometimes stopped to have sex with the bodies. 
Victims' relatives wept quiet­ly in the courtroom. 
"It was hard to sit there and see him not show any feeling and not show any remorse," said Kathy Mills, whose daugh­ter Opal was 16 when she van­ished in 1982. Opal's body was found in the Green River three days later. 
Ridgway's 
Tony Savage said 
Ridgway's emo­tions came "in private, in emo­tional ways, in tears and in words .... He feels terrible remorse." 
"The Green River nightmare is over," King County Prosecutor Norm Maleng said after the proceeding. 
But Sheriff Dave Reichert ­one of the first investigators on the case as a young detective -said that the investigation continues and that charges in more cases were possible. Under the plea bargain, Ridgway is not protected from the death penalty in other jurisdictions. He has not been charged elsewhere, but admit-

the county and in Oregon. 
Other serial killers have 
bragged of murdering many 
dozens of victims, but 
Ridgway's plea agreement, 
signed June 13, puts more 
murders on his record than 
any other serial killer in U.S. 
history. 

John Wayne Gacy, who preyed on men and boys in Chicago in the 1970s, was con­victed of killing 33 people. Ted Bundy, whose killing started in Washington state, confessed to killing more than 30 women and girls but was convicted of murdering only three before he was executed. 
At a news conference, Maleng·said his first reaction to striking a deal that would take the death penalty off the table was no: "If any case screams out for the death penalty, this was it." 
But he said he finally agreed to bring a resolution to dozens of unsolved Green River cases. Investigators had evidence to pursue charges in seven cases but had exhausted their leads in the others, and the victims' families -including those whose loved ones had never even been found -deserved answers, Maleng said. 
Since signing off on the deal, Ridgway has worked with investigators to recover the remains of some victims. Ridgway has been married three times and has a son, but none of his family members or supporters attended the hear­ing. 
"Justice and mercy for the victims, the family and our community, and that is why we entered into this agreement," the prosecutor said.

WASHINGTON -House and 
Senate bargainers agreed 
Wednesday to halve President 
Bush's request for studying 
"bunker buster" nuclear war­
heads and make other cuts in 
research into a new generation of 
nuclear weapons. 

The negotiators also decided to provide nearly all of what Bush wanted to continue preparatory work on a nuclear waste storage site at Yucca Mountain in the Nevada desert. 
The money was included in a compromise $27.3 billion meas­ure financing energy and water projects for the government's new budget year. Lawmakers hoped to push it through Congress in the next few days. 
The decisions came as legisla­tors struggled to meet a self­imposed Nov. 21 deadline to adjourn Congress for the year. So far, they have approved only four of the 13 must-pass spending bills, although the House voted 417-5 to send the Senate the fifth, a $9.3 billion measure for military construction. 
Bargainers on the energy-water bill decided to provide $7.5 mil­lion for work on the bunker busters, .bombs that would bur­row through earth and rock to destroy underground targets. The administration wanted twice that amount. 
The bill would provide all $6 million Bush proposed for research into "mini-nukes" of less than 5,000 tons of TNT, or one­fourth the explosive power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, on Aug. 6, 1945. But $4 million of that amount would be provided only after the administration submits a

Discussing homosexuality debate 
Over the past year, a large number of columns and letters have been writ­ten on the subject of homosexuality. It is with some hesitation that I add to that number. 
However, I think I can safe­
Peter Wicks 

ly say that my 
contribution to

Englishman

will be different 
Abroad

in at least one respect because 
I'm not going to tell you what I think. 
Really, it's better this way. Our views on homosexuality are based upon a whole range of deep assumptions about morality, human nature and the authority -or lack of it -of the Bible and the Church. An 800-word opinion piece is not going to change your mind. But the columns and the letters keep coming in, and I doubt I am the only person who has wondered what those who write them are hoping to achieve. 
The arguments usually fall into one of two categories: those that aren't really arguments at all, but rather cocktails of assertion and invective, and those that really are arguments, but not good ones. 
Leaving aside the bald assertions that "homosexuality is wrong" the majority of arguments made for that position are appeals to scripture or the teaching of the Church. But letters to the editor are not a good medium for arguments establishing the authority of scripture or scriptural exegesis. 
Similarly, at least since the emer­gence of widespread dissent on the issue of artificial contraception, many Catholics have ceased to believe that the Church has the authority to tell them what to do in their sexual lives. Whatever one thinks about the legiti­macy of this dissent, the issue won't be settled in this column, or on these pages. 
The argument that homosexuals tend to be more promiscuous than het­erosexuals is irrelevant to moral issue. We should -and usually do -judge individuals by their own behavior, not the statistics for the groups to which they belong. If a study came out show­ing that the English were, on average, more promiscuous than the French, I don't see why I should be concerned­though I might be a little surprised. 
Turning to the arguments on the other side, again we find little that will persuade those who do not already agree. Earlier in this semester, a stu­dent wrote in these pages that a God who gave people a homosexual orien­tation but who forbid them to act upon their sexual inclinations would be "objectively inconsistent." 
But surely we do believe that some people -pedophiles, to give the most obvious example-have sexual incli­nations on which it would be wrong to act? Indeed, if we consistently held the view that God would not give us desires on which it was wrong to act, we would have trouble explaining why he would have given us the moral law at all. The Church has traditionally avoided this problem by saying that not all of our desires are in fact God given. The doctrine is called Original Sin. 
No, I didn't just compare homosexu­ality with pedophilia. 
I won't get into the issue of whether homosexuality is genetic or cultural or a combination of both in origin. That too is irrelevant to the moral issue. The mistake is to equate this question with the issue of whether or not a homosexual has any choice over his sexual orientation. But if orientation were determined by events in early childhood then it would not follow that a person had any more choice over his orientation than if it was genetic. 
As to the recent exchange between correspondents trying to settle the issue on scientific grounds, I think the most recent position that was taken was this: The National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuals is biased and should be ignored because it produces statements saying that homosexuality is a disorder; instead we should trust the American Psychology Association when it says that homosexuality is not a disorder because the APA is unbiased. Also, NARTH is a small organization full of crackpots, but the APA has 161,000 members, and 161,000 psychologists can't be wrong. Well, they were wrong until1973 of course, but they can't be wrong now. 
Clearly we aren't going to get very far this way. 

At least for the foreseeable future, there is no chance that the debate over homosexuality will go away, but perhaps it could go better. The letters calling for understanding, tolerance and respect get the words right, but go wrong by suggesting that anyone who possessed those virtues would by necessity agree with the letter writer. 
Typically, they also err in equating respect with approval. Sometimes we show respect to someone by disagree­ing with them. But it is hard to see this in debates about sexuality, because we -heterosexuals and homosexuals alike-are taught to think of our sex­uality as central to our very identity, the key to who we are. This (question­able) assumption is shared by many on both sides of the debate and accounts for the passion and pain that accom­panies the arguments.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 


Winning tradition lacking at ND 
This letter is in response to Kathleen Tallmadge's Nov. 3 letter "Support NO team unconditionally." In the letter, she argues that "while winning is a Notre Dame tradition, it is certainly nowhere near to being the most important." 
Quite frankly, in all sports, the purpose of the game is to win. If sports were not about winning, there would be no point in competing with other teams. Everyone would go to watch practices and be perfectly happy. But people don't enjoy going to watch teams practice. Why? Because sports are about competition and winning, and anything in sports that does not bring you closer to the goal of winning is a fail­ure. 
At Notre Dame, we have a great tradition. That tradition only exists because our teams have won. Sure, we have had a few bad stretches in our history, but if the Irish had not won consistently over the past 80-plus years, our football tradition would be no different from that of any other sub­par program or, at the least, from any of the former football greats such as the University of Chicago.

We, as the inheritors of the tradition of Notre Dame foot­ball, should walk into that stadium every Saturday expecting a win. That has not been the case for the past six years or so. Many people even expect us to lose to Navy this year. This is unacceptable at Notre Dame. 
The coaches, the players, the fans and we students owe the former players, coaches, fans and students who built the Notre Dame tradition before us, as well as those who will carry it on after us, nothing but excellence in everything we do, including footbalL We should win, and we should win in the right way. That is what Notre Dame and her football team are all about. Cheering for a team that has just lost to FSU by 37 points like they just beat FSU by 37 points is not demanding excellence. It is embracing mediocrity or worse.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Reconsider attitudes toward Iraq war 
If we view the war in Iraq with a monolithic approach, i.e. "American Democracy" versus "Islamic Fundamentalism," then we do not do justice to the political realities and complex truths of recent history. I must respectfully dis­agree with Greg Parnell's Nov. 3 column, but this is not solely a response to him. 
I did not and still do not believe we should have gone to war with Iraq. I do recognize, though, the fact that we are over there now, and we must remain until the job is completed. And neither the Republicans nor the Democrats should use the rising military death toll to their political advantage. 
At the very same time, however, we must examine the reasons given for this war so that over-simplistic generalizations do not feed further clashes; this must be done even at the risk of being labeled "unpatriotic" or part of the "anti-war left." 
It is safe to say that America sought to usurp Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath regime, for good or bad reasons. But what exactly is Ba'athism? It is a romantic, secular, radical Arab nationalism; it lit­erally means "resurrection." The party was founded in 1946 by Michel Aflaq-a Christian-and Salah al-Din al-Bitar. Arab civiliza­tion will always be tied to Islam, but Ba'athism's focus is secular and has proven to be quite hostile to Islamist goals. 
Let us think, then, how could Saddam Hussein, perhaps the least Islamic of any Arab ruler, have used God as a rallying point in 1991 and in 2003? How come we tacitly supported his regime in the 1980s to contain a rising Islamic state, Iran? If recent guerilla attacks in Iraq are by Hussein loyalists, then are the attackers "fundamentalists"? 
My questions do not aim to convert anybody's opinions about the war, and 
I realize I have not made substantive arguments here. Rather, I am wor­ried about a recent American tendency. You see, the Ba'athists and other Arab nationalists were very good at manipulating history. 
They toyed with academic curriculums, simplified past events and immersed students in a selective glorified account of Arab histo­
ry, all in the name of awakening or sustaining the "Arab nation." I do not suggest that Americans have gone that far. However, this ~·good/free v. eviVoppressed" approach of ours is 
dangerous and completely false because it ignores a shared his­tory, shared responsibilities and, more importantly, commonali­ties, and it is tiresomely self-glorifying. Ifour only understand­ings of this history come from the news networks and The Observer, I am wary that we might take on characteristics of a regime we were supposed to destroy.

LETTERS TO THE EDiTOR 
Maintain positive attitude toward team 
In Quinn Eide's Nov. 3 letter, a student voiced his concern about showing too much full support for our football team. He fears that the students' enthusiastic response to last Saturday's raising of the helmets lowered the standard for one of the greatest football pro­grams in the nation and was detrimental to the team. 
I seriously doubt that Coach Tyrone Willingham's speech in the locker room was anything like, "Well, we lost by 37 points but since our students still love us, I guess we played well enough." Do you really think the players do not realize their failures and mistakes and do not take each loss harder than any of the rest of the stu­dents here? 
The football team raises their helmets to the student section nei­ther for an assessment of their performance nor even for approval of their efforts but to show school spirit and to celebrate the unity of the Notre Dame family, both of which do not depend on out­comes. Outcomes are nice, and if you ask people what is great about Notre Dame football, you will undoubtedly hear about out­comes such as national championships and Heisman Trophy win­ners and so forth. However, outcomes can depend on factors out of our control, and thus a foundation built on outcomes is fragile. 
A truly great football program is built not only with the team but also with the entire student body and involves plays off the field as well as on the field. Cheering, doing the jig, eating hot dogs and having fun are just as, if not more, important than the outcome of the game. 
A foundation of excellence is laid when everyone does their best, not just the players but the rest of the student body as well. The band has a standard that we always play as loud and as well as we can, and likewise it is also expected that the students cheer as loud as they can. It is important to celebrate when our team succeeds but it is just as important to give our team support when they need us. As students, we are the foundation for the University and the foundation for the football team, and we must be able to raise our team's spirits when they struggle, in the same way that they raise ours when they succeed. 
As the game drew to a close last Saturday, cheering loudly would have indeed been inappropriate, for that was the moment of Florida State's victory. However, when the band takes the field to play the renowned Victory March and beloved Alma Mater and the players face the students, the outcome of the game is forgotten, and we remember that we are all part of the Notre Dame family. 
The raising of the golden helmets is not to signify a win or even an excellent performance but to remind us, just as Our Lady on the Golden Dome does, that we are united in spirit as one student body. The suggestion of "strictly clapping" is for fans whose school spirit depends solely on outcomes. The kind of unfeeling and impersonal attitude you described is what really lacks meaning. It is that atti­tude and not the cheering you witnessed·Saturday that lowers our standard for excellence.

NAACP misrepresented 
While I agree with his general assessment that "To Kill a Mockingbird" is a fantastic book, I would like to take issue with three things in Joe Licandro's Nov. 6 column "A Book Worth Reading." 
First, Licandro is plainly wrong when he says, "The NAACP is guilty of censorship not constitutionally permitted in this country." The constitution limits the actions of the gov­ernment, not of private organizations like the NAACP. Imagine that a high school announced that it was going to perform a play that portrayed Joseph Stalin as a hero and benevolent champion of the common man. A citizens' group-conservative, liber­al, whatever-might protest that choice, and the school might change its mind. This would certainly not be the sort of censorship pro­hibited by the constitution, and neither is what the NAACP did here. 
Second, Licandro says that "the NAACP and its tag-team partner the American Civil Liberties Union need to read "To Kill a Mockingbird" because they-more than anyone else -need a lesson in tolerance these days." What does the ACLU possibly have to do with this story? Throughout its 
EDITORIAL CARTOON 

history the ACLU has consistently been a voice for free expression above all else. In the late 1970s, for example, the ACLU offended many liberals by defending the right of American Nazi's to stage a march in the largely Jewish suburb of Skokie, Illinois. While one can certainly debate the wisdom of some of the ACLU's positions, nothing in their history indicates that they would support the NAACP in this situation. 
Finally, I object to the use of the term "white trash" to describe anyone. Historically, the term arose in a racially seg­regated society where whites were consid­ered superior and blacks were all considered to be trash. The term "white trash" was used to indicate that poor whites, while not as inferior as blacks, certainly were not as valuable as human beings as whites with money. Bob Ewell's character is disgusting, but insulting him with a term meant to demean all poor whites is insulting to other poor whites.

Legends' biggest act yet debuted Wednesday night 
Gavin Degraw leads list of bands performing at Legends this week 
ByMICHAELBARRETT 
Scc:ne Writer 
Ah, music -the eternal magnet of the masses. Well, this week is not one to dis­appoint at Legends, where four bands are slated to play Wednesday through Saturday. Wednesday night hosted nationally renowned singer/songwriter Gavin DeGraw, who is arguably the biggest act to play Legends thus far. Thursday's show features Notre Dame's own Sudsbury Shore. Friday is also a big night with jam band Umphrey's McGee, whose Chicago-based members are Notre Dame alumni. Saturday's band is Chauncey, a critically acclaimed pop rock act out of Boston. You can call Legends butter, because it's on a roll. 
Gavin DeGraw is a 26-year-old talent­ed singer/songwriter out of New York, who has turned heads in the industry for quite a while. Now his underground suc­cess is finally paying off with critical acclaim of his album Chariot helping to add to his already large and devoted fan base. 
Growing up in upstate New York, 
·DeGraw learned at a young age to appreciate music more than simply a profession but rather a fundamental part of life. After he started playing piano and singing at age eight, he con­tinued· to develop his skills into his teenage years. It was during this time that he discovered the music of Ray Charles and Sam Cooke, two legendary artists who still have an influence on Gavin's music. He was able to further hone his craft at Ithaca College on a music scholarship. He dropped out of classes after one semester, however, when he realized that he was spending most of his time writing songs. DeGraw then moved to Boston, where he attend­ed the prestigious Berklee College of Music for a year while fronting a rock band and playing gigs. He left because he felt the school was restricting him from pursuing certain musical territo­ries. 
After moving to Manhattan in early 1998, he started playing shows, which soon gained him local recognition and in turn gave him the confidence to contin­ue. It was a few months later when fate intervened at an open-mike night at Wilson's, a popular Upper West Side club. It was here that he impressed the crowd so much that the club's owner, Debbie Wilson, became his manager the next day. Gavin's popularity spread quickly throughout the Manhattan music scene, where he continued to play his exciting shows, alternating between a solo piano act and a full rock band. When he first received an offer from a major music label, he declined in order to further develop his craft as a song­writer and performer. He subsequently signed a publishing deal with Warner/Chappell. who released a six­song CD Gavin Live, recorded from shows at Wilson's. 
It was after playing a sold-out gig at Joe's Pub in New York in the spring of 2002 that he signed a deal.with J Records and soon began work on his debut album Chariot with producer Mark Endert (Fiona Apple, Tonic, Ours). In regards to adjusting to the studio, DeGraw says that it was a "real process" because he had to "learn the language and the science of making a record." DeGraw truly exposes emotion and tal­ent beyond his years on this album, resulting in rave reviews from fans~ and critics alike. Despite his relatively sud­den success, DeGraw remains level­headed because "writing and playing songs and making a connection with people ... make a lot more sense to me than trying to be the Next Big Thing." Check out his website at www.gavinde­graw.com. 
Sudsbury Shore will be playing Thursday night at Legends. Composed of current Notre Dame students Brad Faircloth on guitar and vocals, Greg Ujda on bass and vocals, Brendon Collins on drums and vocals, and Matt Marnocha on keys/organ/guitar/vocals, this talented band mixes elements of jazz, funk, electronic and folk music. 
Friday night will feature Umphrey's McGee (www.umphreys.com), a nation­ally-renowned jam band of creative musicians who also happen to be Notre 
· Dame alumni. Based from Chicago, these guys have one of the most unique sounds out there, blending everything from clas­sical and bluegrass to gangsta-rap and metal to jazz improvisation and funk. Forming in 1997 on our very own campus, original mem­bers Joel Cummins ('97; piano/vocals), Brendan Bayliss ('98; guitar/vocals), Ryan Stasik ('98; bass) and former drummer Mike Mirro joined with percussionist Andy Farag and guitarist Jake Cinninger. The band had previously released Greatest Hits Volume III and Songs For Older Women, and after Mirro recently left for medical school, drum­mer Kris Myers joined the band. 
Known for encouraging bootlegs at their shows, they rely heavily on their fans to spread their music and name around via the Internet. This is the main reason why venues where they've never played before will often times be sold out based solely on word-of­mouth. Their captivating live performances, often likened to Phish, and their huge following across the nation has led them to increase their popularity throughout the country. Their biggest show to-date was the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, where they played in front of 12,000 people along­side such bands as Widespread Panic. They have also played at such festivals as the High Sierra Music Festival, South By Southwest, Hookahville and HarvestFest. Another recent highlight has been the release of their DVD, as recorded at the Skyline Stage in Chicago. Umphrey's McGee recently released their third studio album aptly titled Local Band Does O.K. It is obvious they have dDne more than mediocre, ·and their exciting show is bound to "wow" the Notre Dame audience on Friday night. 
On Saturday, Legends will host Boston­area band Chauncey, a rock/pop group influenced by the Beatles and Radiohead. Steve Morse of The Boston Globe describes the band as "fine angu­lar pop with a cerebral edge, designed for people who still think pop should mean something." Fronted by John Paul Powell on keyboards and vocals, the band consists of Eliot Hunt and Jake Zuckerman on guitar, John Bistline on bass, and Shawn Marquis on drums. The band has toured with such acts as Guster, Midnight Oil and Dispatch, thus exposing their music to as many as peo­ple as possible. Their self-titled album chauncey won "Best Rock Album" by Boston Magazine, which said that the "swerving melodies, bending rhythms, and emotional truths ... revived our faith in rock 'n' roll."

New Tony Hawk video game has more of a story feel a 
By SARAH VABULAS 
Scc:nc Editor 

The new Tony Hawk sequel could be easily called, according to PlayStation Magazine, "create your own Tony Hawk sequel." It is the most customizable of any Hawk game yet. Underground gives users the ability to make their own tricks, decks and level objec­tives (complete with easy-to-use editing tools), as well as giving the ability to customize their own character or even make one them­selves. 
Users can e-mail Neversoft a photograph and then connect their PS2 to its online server and type in the given pass­word in a reply e-mail. All users need to do to finish off the process is to pin­point their eyes and mouth once the picture is uploaded to the PS2 unit, and the game correctly maps the face onto the character's body. 
And if putting yourself inside the game isn't cool enough, the new story mode, formally known as "career mode" in past Hawk games, has been dramatically improved. In the game's 27 chapters, a gamer can skate around town, fulfill the objectives and get such skaters like Arto Scari, Mike Vallely, Paul Rodriguez, Jr. and even skater/director Stacy Peralta to notice your mad skating skills. 
In Underground, rather than focus on replacing the levels and adding new layers of depth to the gameplay, Activision and Neversoft have tried to turn the entire series upside down, taking the focus off of the skaters who are already profes­sionals. Instead, the spot­light is placed on an unknown skater and his quest for fame, which takes him from the mean streets of New Jersey to the heights of skateboard­ing stardom. 
These qualities make Underground feel more personable then simply skating around, doing tricks or objectives with no storyline behind it.

New Notre Dame band to playat Reekers' this Friday 
Dillon-based group, Bebop and Rocksteady, prep to live up to their name 
It was then that freshman Justin Oppel became the drummer and the third member of Bebop and Rocksteady. 
Since the guys typically practice in the basement of Dillon, people can hear them from outside the building when they walk by. Many times, people will just go down to the basement to check out what is going on. 
"We get a lot of people we've never met before come listen," Fantazier said. "Random people come down because we play different songs that remind them of when they were younger." 
Their set list is quite different and eclectic. It is definitely worth checking out. They play such songs as "Traveling Man," "Basketcase," "American Woman" and "Flagpole Sitta," among other songs by Green Day, Bush and other favorites. 
One of the most redeeming qualities of Bebop is their originality in their rendi­tions of many of the songs. They keep some in as original form as they can, while others sound completely different

Tired of the same old weekend nights? Like to support campus bands? Well, this Friday night at Reekers, Bebop and Rocksteady will premiere their talents. 
Made up of men from Dillon Hall, they play covers, many of which are reminis­cent of the middle school years. 
Sophomore Matt Fantazier and fresh­man Andrew Zwers met in Glee Club. In middle September, they began to talk about starting a band. Since Fantazier plays the guitar and sings, while Zwers plays the bass guitars and sings, they had to search out a drummer. 
"We heard about a guy that lived near the mailboxes who played the drums, so we went to find him," Fantazier said. "Justin was checking his mail and over­heard us. He told us that he played the drums, so he had them mailed here. And then here we are." 
-and in some ways, better than how the songs were originally written. They personali~e some of the lyrics to relate to being at school at Notre Dame and add humor. 
While they cover songs, they also have some originals in the making. They won't premiere Friday night, but they will come out soon. 
The band formed a description of themselves, which can be found on fliers across campus: "Alternative new wave garage country [music] at it's finest!" This fairly accurately describes the sound that comes from these three guys. 
Fantazier and Zwers both sing and strum their guitars very well, while Oppel rocks out on his drum set, complete with a cow bell for added gusto. 
Opening up for Bebop and Rocksteady is Tom Shrek, who also is a member of the Glee Club. He will join Bebop for a couple songs during their set as an added vocalist. 
"It will be fun to play for our friends," Fantazier said. '' We're excited. We're going to bebop and rocksteady all night long ... Reekers style." 
You can listen to the sounds of Bebop and Rocksteady Friday night at Reekers beginning at 10:15 p.m.

NFL 
Manning lawsuit slated for March trial date 
Father offormer University of Tennessee quarterback comes to son's defense 
Associated Press 
Former NFL quarterback Archie Manning believes son Peyton has been punished enough for a mistake he made seven years ago, and thus a defamation lawsuit should have been dismissed. 
In an interview with The 
Associated Press. the elder Manning said his son regrets dropping his pants in front of a University of Tennessee trainer and tried to apologize to her. 
"He felt it was his mistake, he tried to apologize and he was remorseful." 
Archie Manning said 
On our team, your brightest ideas get noticed. 
experience and knowledge to spot it. It's your time to shine. 
Archie Manning said he was dismayed that the "feel-good" book is now the subject of legal action. 
"Obviously, my wife and I and our family hurt for Peyton at a time like this,"he said. 
"We're sad for him, espe­cially since an incident from seven years ago seems to have gotten so twisted." 
Naughright filed the lawsuit in Polk County, Fla., in 2002, two years after the book was published. 
In the lawsuit, she accuses Manning of placing his "naked butt" on her face while in the Volunteers' locker room. 
She is seeking damages of at least $15,000. 
In 1997, she agreed to a $300,000 settlement with the university over 3 3 alleged instances of sexual harass­ment surrounding her job in the athletic department, and her complaint included the encounter with Manning. 
Manning was not personally accused of sexual harassment, and a university investigation characterized it as "horse­play." 
Manning's attorney, Slade Metcalf, argued in court papers that the lawsuit should be thrown out because the passages in the book are "substantially" true. 
He also contends the settle­ment released the university, its employees and students, including Manning, from addi­tional damages. 
"That's what we feel, that's what I feel, that's the way Peyton feels," Archie Manning told the AP. 
Peyton Manning declined to comment. 
Nau ghrigh t's attorney, Robert Puterbaugh, also wouldn't comment. 
Judge Harvey Kornstein ruled Monday that there was enough evidence to suggest the Mannings, the writer and the publisher knew the pas­sages were false and acted in reckless disregard for the truth. 
In the book, Manning says he pulled down his pants and conceded that his behavior was "inappropriate." 
"Crude, maybe, but harm­less," he wrote. He also wrote that the train­er had a "vulgar mouth." 
The lawsuit also names writer John Underwood and publisher HarperCollins Inc. 
"Peyton knows people have a right to say what they want about him," Archie Manning said. 
"He said what happened seven years ago and it's still true."

Tuesday night. "He got punished and he took his punishment." 
The 1996 encounter between the trainer and the Indianapolis Colts quarter­back is mentioned in a book the Mannings wrote, "Manning: A Father, His Sons and a Football Legacy." 
Earlier this week, a judge ruled there was enough evi­dence for the trainer's lawsuit against the Mannings to pro­ceed, and a trial was set for March. 
Though she's not named in the book, Jamie Ann Naughright says the passages disparaged her.

NHL 

Kovalchuk's three points lead Thrashers to 7-4 victory 

Associated Press 
BUFFALO, N.Y.-With two offensive players out of the line­up, Ilya Kovalchuk thinks he needs to play even better for the Atlanta Thrashers. 
That's a scary thought for the rest of the NHL. 
Patrik Stefan scored on a penalty shot, and Randy Robitaille and Kovalchuk each had a goal and two assists in the Atlanta Thrashers' 7-4 victory over the Buffalo Sabres on Wednesday night. 
Shawn McEachern added three assists for Atlanta, which snapped a three-game winless streak and moved into first place in the Southeast Division. 
Kovalchuk leads the league with 12 goals and 20 points. 
"The sky's the limit for him," Atlanta coach Bob Hartley said. "He still has a way to go, but he's paying more attention to details now." 
Kovalchuk, who earlier this week was named NHL's offensive player of the month for October, opened the scoring at the 7:34 mark of the first with a quick wrister that beat Martin Biron. 
Kovalchuk has scored in eight of the Thrashers' 13 games and has a point in all but two games. It was also the sixth time this sea­son he recorded a multiple-point game. 
"With Marc [Savard] and Dany [Heatley] missing I have to be a much better player than normal," Kovalchuk said. "Those are two pretty good offensive players that are missing." 
The Thrashers played their first game without Savard, who underwent surgery to repair torn ligaments in his left ankle 
Afraid of commitment? 


Fr. Kevin Russeau, C.S.C., associate vocation director. 

Come anyway. 

Tuesday. He's expected to miss eight to 10 weeks. At the time of his injury, Savard was the team's second-leading scorer behind Kovalchuk. 
Los Angeles 3, Rorlda 2 
The Los Angeles Kings ended their struggles in Florida. 
Derek Armstrong and Trent Klatt scored power-play goals and the Los Angeles Kings won at Florida for the first time, beating the Panthers 3-2 on Wednesday night. 
Jonathan Sim also scored for Las Angeles, which was a com­bined 0-4-3 at Miami Arena and the Office Depot Center. 
"I read that before the game," Kings forward Luc Robitaille said. "It was a good win tonight. We needed a win." 
Roman Cechmanek made 33 saves for the Kings to improve to 6-1-1 lifetime against Florida. 
"I know they beat us in the only game we played last year in L.A., so maybe they had the Kings' number," Kings coach Andy Murray said. "It's nice for us to turn the corner on it." 
Rookie Nathan Horton and Mike Van Ryn scored for Florida. It was the second goal in two games for Horton, the third over­all pick in this year's draft. 
Roberto Luongo made 23 saves in his first start in three games for the Panthers. 
The Kings had seven power­play opportunities in the flrst two periods, while Florida had only two. 
"We had nine penalties in the flrst two periods," Panthers for­ward Kristian Huselius said. "It's tough to come back and get the momentum. If we're going to be in the box all day long, we're not going to win many games." 
New Jersey 3, San Jose 2, OT 
Jamie Langenbrunner and the New Jersey Devils overcame a sluggish start for an exciting win. 
Langenbrunner scored with 
42.7 seconds remaining in over­time Wednesday night to give the Devils a 3-2 victory over the San Jose Sharks. 
New Jersey pressed the attack in the final minute of overtime as Scott Niedermayer had three solid chances. The pressure paid off when John Madden spun and whipped a hard backhand pass across the slot that Langenbrunner slammed home from the bottom of the left circle. 
"It felt like about an hour," Langenbrunner said of waiting for the puck. "We were tired. It was the end of a shift." 

The game, which lacked pace through the first two periods, quickened in the third period and peaked in overtime. 
"They will blame us for the way we played," Devils coach Pat Burns said. "It wasn't the way we played. San Jose backed up and tried to trap us all night long. They were playing in a position where they didn't want to lose it." 
Scott Stevens set up the first two New Jersey goals, by Christian Berglund and Turner Stevenson, to reach 900 career points. Martin Brodeur made 13 saves as the Devils extended their winning streak to four games. 
Scott Thornton and Alexander Korolyuk scored for the Sharks, who have won only two games yet have 10 points thanks to five ties and the overtime loss to the Devils.

Maddux fails to earn Gold Glove Widow of former RB 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Atlanta pitcher Mike Hampton ended Greg Maddux's record run of NL Gold Gloves while Luis Castillo and Derrek Lee of the World Series champion Florida Marlins won for the first time Wednesday. 
Scott Rolen, Edgar Renteria, Jim Edmonds and Mike Matheny of the St. Louis 
Cardinals were among those honored for fielding excellence. 
Outfielders Andruw Jones of Atlanta and Jose Cruz Jr. of San Francisco also were chosen. The awards are based on the regular season -Cruz stum­bled in the playoffs, falling on a fly ball in Game 2 against Florida and then dropping a routine fly that led to the Giants' extra-inning loss in Game 3. 
Maddux had won 13 straight 
times, the most by an NL pitch­er and three short of the overall record for pitchers set by Jim Kaat. Hampton beat out his Braves teammate in winning for the first time. 
Hampton made one error in 68 chances while Maddux had two mistakes in 73 chances. 
Castillo replaced St. Louis' Fernando Vina at second base and Lee took over for Colorado's Todd Helton at first base. 
Rolen won for the fourth straight time and earned his fifth award overall at third base. Edmonds was picked for the fourth time as an NL out­fielder, adding to the three AL Gold Gloves he won with the Angels. 

Matheny and Renteria each won for the second time. Jones has won six straight NL Gold Gloves and Cruz was hon­
ored for the first time. 
Gold Gloves, presented since 1957 by St. Louis-based Rawlings, are voted on by man­agers and coaches before the end of the regular season. They may not select players on their own teams, and they vote only for players in their own league.

Castro ordered to stand trial for rape 
Associated Press 
Florida Marlins catcher Ramon Castro was ordered Wednesday to stand trial on charges he raped a woman in his hotel room in August. 
A magistrate made the rul­ing after Castro's accuser testified during a prelimi­nary hearing. 
The 28-year-old woman said she met Castro at the hotel's bar after a game between the Marlins and the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
She said she went to his room with another couple in the early morning hours of Aug. 28. 
She said Castro asked the

other couple to leave, then attacked her. 
Castro's attorney, J. Alan Johnson, said his client is innocent and that hotel sur­veillance tapes will eventual­ly prove that. 
Castro was allowed to remain free until trial, which wasn't immediately sched­uled. 
Castro, a 27-year-old mar­ried father of two, was arrested after the woman went to police with her story. 
He was charged with rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, indecent assault, sexual assault and unlawful restraint. 
The rape charge carries a maximum sentence of 20 to 40 years in prison. 
Although under state sen­tencing guidelines it's unlikely Castro would 
1 receive such a sentence if he were convicted. Johnson said he has hired investigators to review the case and said the "time ele­ment" of the woman's accu­sations was crucial. A third-string catcher used mostly as a pinch hitter, Castro hit .283 with 5 home runs and 8 RBis in just 53 at-bats last season. 
He didn't play during the World Series, which the Marlins won after beating the New York Yankees.

TCU remains undefeated 
Associated Press 

TCU did just enough one more time to remain undefeat­ed and continue the debate about whether it deserves to be part of the Bowl Championship Series. 
"The difference in that game was about three inches," coach Gary Patterson said after the 13th-ranked Horned Frogs beat Louisville 31-28 Wednesday night. 
The Frogs didn't have the win until Nate Smith's 44-yard field goal attempt on the final play of the game bounced off the crossbar. That was his third miss in the second half. 
"It looked like it was right on," said TCU quarterback Brandon Hassell, who passed for 251 yards and a touchdown while running for 61 yards and another score. "My heart was beating fast. When it hit the crossbar, I just felt joy." 
And an incredible sense of relief after the Frogs' fifth three-point win this season. 
TCU (9-0, 6-0 Conference USA) and Oklahoma (9-0), the No. 1 team in every poll, are the only undefeated teams left in major college football. Both 
have  11-game  winning  
streaks.  
Smith, who failed  on a  22­ 

yard kick in the third quarter, had also missed a 4 7 -yard attempt well short with 2:36 left. But TCU wasn't able to run the clock out. 
The Cardinals got the ball back at their 20 with 55 sec­onds left and no timeouts. Stefan LeFors completed pass-

es of 10 and 19 yards to J.R. Russell, then on fourth-and-15 scrambled away from pressure to find Robert Haskins for 29 yards to the TCU 27 to set up Smith's attempt. 
LeFors finished 31-of-46 for 459 yards with a touchdown, and ran for a 9-yard TD on a fake field goal in the fourth quarter. Lionel Gates had nine catches for 134 yards, and Russell caught eight passes for 119 yards. 
TCU is 9-0 for the first time since 1938, when the Frogs went undefeated and won their only national champi­onship with quarterback Davey O'Brien. 
The Horned Frogs are ninth in the BCS rankings, the same spot they reached in 2000 after a 7-0 start. They will have to finish three spots high­er to be guaranteed a berth in one of the four lucrative BCS games. Kenny Hayter's 1-yard TD run early in the fourth quarter gave TCU a 31-21 lead, capping an 11-play, SO­yard drive after Smith pushed his 22-yard attempt just right. 
Smith had made 13 of 14 field goals, including 21-and 26-yarders in the first half before his three misses. His only miss before Wednesday had been a blocked 47-yard attempt against South Florida. 
"In no way is this loss all his fault," Petrino said.

Irish quarterback Brady Quinn throws a pass against Florida State during last Saturday's 37-0 shutout. 
Scoring 
continued from page 24 
the ball on Florida State's nine­yard line following a Vontez Duff interception and the Seminoles up 10-0. 
But all the Irish could do was move the ball two yards in three plays, pick up two penalties and then have D.J. Fitzpatrick's field goal blocked, resulting in zero points and a momentum shift to Florida State. 
The Irish moved the football inside the Seminoles 20-yard line three more times in the sec­ond half and could manage only one touchdown -when Florida State defensive back Leroy Smith intercepted quarterback Brady Quinn and returned the ball 90 yards for a Seminole score. 
"[The missing piece] is putting the ball in the end zone," Irish running back Ryan Grant said. 
"We need to start making teams catch up instead of play­ing catch-up. 
"We've showed we can do good things at times, but we need to put everything togeth­er." 
Notre Dame went for it on fourth down on its two other red zone opportunities in the second half, and Quinn missed receivers Rhema McKnight and Omar Jenkins on respective drives. 
Had the Irish scored on its four trips to the end zone, the outcome of Saturday's game would have been very different. 
Instead of a 37-0 loss, the Irish could have made it a respectable 37-21 game. 
"We always look forward to scoring, but it really has gone that way for us this year," Jones said. "We're just going to stay focused and keep going at it."

eight rebounds. He slashed to the basket all night long, using his body to shield the ball from defenders and flip it acrobati­cally to the hoop. 
"I don't know how he gets through bodies sometimes to get to the backboard," Brey said. "I thought he was really solid for us tonight. And he can guard anybody." 
But Notre Dame's defense struggled at times, especially with the absence of Jordan Cornette, who sat out Wednesday's exhibition with a bruised knee. That left Francis and Timmermans to try to defend Hoop Group's athletic big players. 
Notre Dame's first game since they returned from Barbados was anything but a pushover. The Irish actually trailed for four minutes in the first half as they struggled to get their offense moving and never could put away Hoop Group. 
Or they couldn't until fresh­man Russell Carter, whose defensive struggles in Barbados left Brey wondering if Carter could contribute to Notre Dame, hit two 3-pointers in the last minute of the first half to give the Irish a 45-35 lead at the break. Carter, who only returned for a few more sec­onds in the second half, left Wednesday's exhibition averag­ing six points a minute. 
Even then, Notre Dame could­n't quite pull away. 
Although the Irish stretched the lead to as large as 16 points early in the second half, a handful of Hoop Group came back to draw the score to with­in six and seven points numer­ous times late in the half.

~ Belles' season comes to an end with hard-fought loss 

ByJUSTIN SCHUVER Associate Sports Editor 
The Belles put up a good fight. but their season came to an end Tuesday night against Hope in the first round of the MIAA tournament. Saint Mary's fell to the Flying Dutch by a score of 28-30, 18-30, 28­30. 
''I thought we played really well in the first and third games," coach Julie Schroeder­Biek said. "That second game, though, Hope really controlled it; it just seemed we were struggling in that game." 
No. 6 seed Saint Mary's jumped out to a big lead

By ANDREW SOUKUP Sports Writer 
Torrian Jones missed a dou­ble-double by two rebounds. Torin Francis started establish­ing himself as an offensive force with a double-double of his own. Russell Carter is averag­ing six points a minute. Tom Timmermans banged down low for 31 minutes. Chris Quinn fired 3-pointers like he was try­ing to replace Matt Carroll. 
And in the midst of a new­look Irish basketball team that still showed no hesitation in launching 3-pointers, Chris Thomas remained the spectacu­lar player that made him con­sider leaving early for the NBA. His on-court management helped Notre Dame beat Hoop Group 88-76 in the first regular exhibition game of the young basketball season. 
"There were a lot of guys in new roles for the first time here," Irish coach Mike Brey said. "It was interesting to watch." 
Aided by the backcourt com­bination of Thomas and Quinn, the Irish pushed the tempo of the game to a fast pace in the first half-something Brey­coached Notre Dame teams haven't traditionally done. Thomas finished with 25 points and nine assists, while Quinn recorded 12 points -all ofT 3­pointers. 
But the goal of the night, at least early on, was to establish Francis, expected to be Notre Dame's primary low-post threat in the season. in the paint to free up the rest of the Irish offense. The sophomore fin­ished with 18 points and 12 rebounds. 
''I'm not a freshman anymore. Some of those mistakes I got away with last year I can't get away with this year," he said. "That's my mentality. I'm older, I'm stronger, I'm more aggres­sive. But now I'm more of a leader, so I have to show that." 
While the sophomore strug­gled some on defense against the Hoop Group's agile big men, he scored Notre Dame's first four points of the game. Then, with the defense collapsing on him when he got the ball, Francis fired pinpoint passes to wide-open shooters on the perimeter. 
"That's what we're trying to do all season," Thomas said. "We have to establish him early in the game. Our inside-outside combo is pretty good right now." 
Then there was Jones, who played a career-high 38 min-

Irish going to focus on scoring 
By ANDREW SOUKUP Sports Writer 
For as bad as Notre Dame played against Florida State last Saturday, the Irish still could have made the game competi­tive. 
Four times the Irish were inside the Seminoles 20-yard line. Four times the Notre Dame offense came away empty-hand­ed. 
"We just haven't been getting it done," Irish running back Julius Jones said. "That's basi­cally what it comes down to. 
If we're going to win we have to get the ball in the end zone." Lack of production in the red zone has been a reoccurring 
theme for the Irish offense. The unit has scored touchdowns in only four of 23 chances inside the 20-yard line this season. 
"As coaches, you have to see if you can get the best call possi­ble." Irish coach Tyrone Willingham said. 
"I think in some cases we have not helped ourselves as well as we need to. I think in many cases, our execution has not been there." 
Willingham did not say youth has been a factor in the ineffi­ciencies of the offense in the red zone this season. 
"I won't call to that as an out for us, no," he said On Saturday, Notre Dame had
