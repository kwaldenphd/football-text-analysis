FormerND professor dies at 91 
By MERYL GUYER 
News Writer 
Thomas J. Stritch, professor emeritus of American Studies, died Jan. 22 at Belcourt Terrace Nursing Home in his native city of Nashville, Tenn. He was 91 years old. 
Stritch was responsible for carrying the Department of Journalism through il'i trans­formation to the Department of Communication Arts and finally to the Department of American Studies in I'J70. 
Walt Collins. professor of American Studies, remem­bered one of Stritch's signa­ture sequences, a four-course sequence called "Modern Culture." The popular courses included "The Arts in America" and were developed on the idea that anyone can learn how to be a journalist by working in a newsroom, but it is more important to be educated on topics on which articles will be written. Collins said philosophy has permeat­ed the program, and that is

The results of Tuesday's online voting pro­pelled the Brown-Fitzgerald 
and White-Moran tickets into the final race for the next president of the Saint Mary's student body. 
Fifty-two percent of the stu­dent body voted in Tuesday's primary election. Sarah Catherine White and Mary Pauline Moran led the pack 


with 46 percent of the vote. White Sarah Brown and Michelle Fitzgerald received 35 percent of the vote after the deduction of their campaign penalty. Shay Jolly and Veronica Saavedra trailed with 17 per­cent of the vote. Two percent of those who voted abstained. 
"We were honored by the primary results and to be thought of as leaders by our peers," White said. "It would be an honor to win, as well, but it is not over until it is over." 
To win the primary, one 

ticket needed to receive 50 percent of the turnout plus one vote. Since this did not happen, a runoff will take place until midnight Thursday in which either the White or Brown ticket must tally the highest total of raw votes. The new student body

University contributes $833 million to community in 2002 
By LIAM FARRELL 
News Writer 
According to an economic impact report set for a Feb. 2 release, Notre Dame con­tributed $833 million to the South Bend community in 2002. 
The biggest areas of impact were purchasing of goods and services which accounted for $536 million, with $305.9 mil­lion of that spent in St. Joseph's County, and $290 million spent on payroll for employees. 
The study is the result of the efforts between divisions of Business Operations and Public Affairs and Communication along with city and county gov­ernment officials. 
J. Roberto Gutierrez, vice president for Public Affairs and Communications, said he sees the economic resources that Notre Dame brings to the com­munity as an opportunity to realize potential for a relation­ship with South Bend. 
"[Notre Dame] brings a lot to the table," he said. "[The future of both communities] is about that kind of cooperation." 
Gutierrez also saw the report as further evidence of Notre Dame's overall mission as a Catholic institution in pursuit of truth and knowledge that is not confined to the classroom. 
"[Learning) doesn't happen in a vacuum. It takes a support structure to make it work," he said. "It doesn't operate in a bubble. It is in the living, breathing city of South Bend." 
Matthew Sturin, associate vice president of news and informa­tion, said that while Notre Dame enjoys a good national and international reputation, it has not necessarily been linked to the surrounding community. 
"It is in our interest to have residents think well of us," Storin said. 
In light of the economic impact and future goals of the University, Storin said that he envisions the relationship of Notre Dame and South Bend as more of a partnership than it has been in previous years.

INSIDE COLUMN 

Bring back bad, rad 

With all this snow continually falling down upon us, I considered writing something about the misery among the student body about the denial of a snow day. But then I decided that, well, at this point, 
my efforts to con­vince anyone of authority that snow days in col­lege would be beneficial for our existence would be futile. 
I must admit, 


however, that it Sarah Vabulas was ridiculous that all the 
schools in the Viewpoint South Bend com­Editor munity had the day off. I am bound and determined to have a snow day before I graduate in 2006. 
So now that the whole snow day issue is out in the open, I can breathe easy and move to the important part of this, dare I say, unimportant col­umn. 
Over semester break, I decided to bring back the words "bad" and "rad." Okay, so that's really a blast from the past. So why would I attempt to bring something back that dwin­dled away for a reason? 
I think "cool," "hot," "neato" and other such adjectives do not fully express my emotions -whether they be about clothes or anything else. Besides, if you've stepped into a mall anytime in the past three months -if you haven't, then I'm sorry -it is obvious that 80's style is making a comeback. I still haven't decided whether I like the fashion trends reemerging, but they are, nonethe­less. 
Lately, I've been reflecting a lot on my elementary school years and the "pop culture" of the time. It really all started when I purchased Michael Jackson's newest CD, "One," which is made up of his songs which hit num­ber one on the charts. It really took me back -back to the days of bright colors, pogs and the words "bad" and "rad." 
As I was cruising the streets of the ATL over break, I felt compelled to dance to the rhythms of my child­hood. I even found myself in the car one night with my mom, and we remi­nisced about the "old days" when I was a little kid, dancing around the house to Michael Jackson's song of the moment. 
But it wasn't until I found myself in Kentucky, on my drive back to South Bend, that it hit me like a brick wall. I turned to my friend Kat and said, "That's it. I'm bringing it back." 
Kat was confused and asked me what it was I wanted to bring back. I looked at her all serious-like and said sternly, "The word 'bad.' I'm bringing it back. Wanna help?" 
After further reflection, I felt that "rad" needed to make a comeback, as well. 
So here I am, writing this column, asking you, faithful Inside Column readers, to help me out by using the words "bad" and "rad." I will forever be in your debt.

Jury rejects claim soup drove man nuts 

WEST PALM BEACH -A jury rejected a man's claims he should be compensated for a sleep disorder suffered since he was served the wrong soup at a restaurant. 
Donald Johnson, 64, sought $55,356 from the Shoney's restaurant chain. The jury instead awarded him $407 for medical bills. 
Johnson, of Lake Worth, said he had to have emer­gency medical treatment in 1995 after eating clam chowder when he had ordered potato soup. He said an allergic reaction left him with psychological and sleep 
disorders. He rejected a $1,000 set­tlement in 1999. 
"I thought it was a silly case," Shoney's attorney, Charles Rice. said Tuesday. 
Rice argued during the trial that Johnson's anxiety might stem from other expe­riences, including a prison term for sexual activity with a child under 12 and his public listing as a sexual predator.

Flyers warn SMC of rape incident 
By ANGELA SAOUD 
N~wsWriter 
Saint Mary's security of'!icers havn posted flyers around campus displaying the picture of and additional information about Jerry Hillegas, a convict­ed rapist who approached two women on another all-female campus Jan. 13. 
Hillegas, on two separate occasions and under the pre­tense of asking for directions, approached two women at Grace College in Warsaw. Ind., and asked them to get into his car. Neither woman was injured. 

"We want to make sure evnryone is given the informa­tion but understands that we have no indication that he is coming this way," said Dave Chapman, director of Saint Mary's security. "We're in a mobile society, and what we want to do at this point is make everyone aware of what has happened." 
Saint Mary's junior Meredith Gramann said she was sur­prised last week when she saw llillegas' face and information posted in her dorm. 
"I was alarmed at the fact that this man could be on our campus," Gramann said. "It sort of got posted without much explanation, and it didn't appear on the Internet site until a few days later." 
Chapman insisted all three campuses are safe and the posters arc just a precaution. lie said Saint Mary's has rarely had problems with intruders on campus, and no incidents have occurred during his three · months of employment at the College. 
A Jan. 16 report in the Warsaw Times-Union newspa­per, however, said Christian colleges and college sporting events are supposedly a favorite place in which Ilillegas targets victims. 
Hillegas' prior convictions include rape, sexual battery, indecent exposure, criminal confinement, battery and attempted battery. 
l-Ie was last seen driving a 2002 silver Buick Hegal four door with the Indiana Plate 35A9347. He was also previ­ously seen driving a 1996 blue Chevy Lumina four door with the Indiana Plate 3587621. 
Chapman offered suggestions for anyone who sees Hillegas or anything suspicious on cam­pus. 
"If you see him, or anything that doesn't seem right, call security and give us as much information as you can," Chapman said. "In these situa­tions, we'd rather be safe than sorry."

Program aims to 'sustain dialogue' 
By JULIA MILLER-LEMON 
News Writer 
Students gathered Wednesday night in the Coleman Morse Lounge to attend the first of two information sessions on Sustained Dialogue. a movement sweeping across college campuses through­out the nation. 
During the session. the more than 30 students in attendance were briefed on the mission of Sustained Dialogue, and the open sharing of personal stories touched on many sensitive issues present within the Notre Dame community. 
A main purpose of Sustained Dialogue is to encourage discus­sion surrounding such controver­sial issues on campus as diversity, religion and gender. but co­founders Tessa Garcia, Eve Thomas and Jelani McEwen­Torrence, (the fourth co-founder, Christine Amill, is currently abroad), said the main goal of the program is to provide an open forum where students are free to talk about any and all issues, not just race or diversity. 
Sustained Dialogue is set up to bridge the University's already­existing retreats and seminars. McEwan-Torrence expressed frustration about the retreats, saying they are beneficial but usually never result in any motion or change. 
"With Sustained Dialogue, the issues won't just be talked about once," she said. "You will get to talk about them over and over ... and work to eradicate stereo­types." 
Garcia initially had the idea to bring Sustained Dialogue to Notre Dame after attending the "Learning To Talk About Race" retreat last year. 
"After the retreat. I was moved by the experience and felt that everyone on campus needed to go through something similar," Garcia said. 
After being given a grant through Notre Dame's

Virginia. and the University of California at Berkley. Garcia found the program she was look­ing for at both Princeton and UVA, where Sustained Dialogue had already achieved club status. 
Her research then led her to Washington, D.C., where she spoke with the founder of the Sustained Dialogue methodology, Harold Saunders, a Princeton alumnus and former U.S. diplo­mat. 
Work on Notre Dame's own Sustained Dialogue program began at the beginning of the fall f!emester, and now Garcia, Thomas, and McEwen-Torrence are working to spread the impor­tance of campus-wide participa­tion. 

After the retreat. the 
groups will meet twice a month to continue the ongoing dialogue process. 
"This is our opportunity to prove that we are ready for a change at Notre Dame," Thomas said. 
Sustained Dialogue began in 1999 at Princeton University and has since become a world-wide movement. not only sprouting up on university campuses but also in countries such as TajikL'itan. 
For more information on the program or to sign up for the retreat, contact Tessa Garcia at tgarcia1@nd.edu or Eve Thomas at ethomasl@nd.edu. 
Contact Julia Miller-Lemon at jmillerl@nd.edu. 

"In order for these dialogues to work. we need everyone's per­spectives and stories, no matter what their race, religion, gender or political background," Garcia said. "This is all about openness. There is no fear here, and there will be no judgment.

Aerobics continue without Kay 

By EMILIE DesJARDINS 
News Writer 
Aerobics classes, up until this semester, were taught by Kay Chubirka. Known to the Saint Mary's community as simply "Kay." This semester, however, the highly-praised instructor has left Saint Mary's. 
"I took Total Body Workout from her once and that is def­initely what it was, a total body workout," said Eva Polizzi, "but I really liked it." 
When word came that Chubirka was leaving Saint Mary's, many students were concerned that meant the end of the great classes they had attended faithfully but time has shown differently, they 
now say. 
At the end of last semester Lynn Kachmarik opened these positions to students. Amy Deja, a junior at Saint Mary's, responded immedi­ately. 
She had recently become certified in pilates and thought the opportunity to teach at Saint Mary's sounded fun, she said. Deja emailed Kachmarik, who said she was excited by the idea of having a pilates course offered at the college. 
Additional instructors have since been hired to teach other aerobics classes. They are free of charge for stu­dents if they wish to take them for academic credit. Courses taught by students however, are not offered for credit. This has not deterred other students' impressions of the courses though or damp­ened Deja's spirits. 
"At first it seemed people were hesitant because Kay was not teaching, but now they seem to be more open to the changes," said Deja, "My afternoon class has been growing every time and everyone has a lot of enthusi­asm." 
Jen Stark, who is taking Deja's pilates course, seems confident that students are teaching the courses. 
"I think it's fine. It's nice to know that someone as busy as us takes the time to teach us to work out," she said.

Four teams to square off in College Bowl 
By AMANDA MICHAELS 
News Writer 
Four teams will square off tonight in semi-final and final rounds of the competition which will decide who will represent Notre Dame in the Association of College Unions International (ACUI) Region 9 College Bowl tournament on Feb. 21 at Indiana University-Purdue University in Indianapolis. 
Touted as "the Varsity Sport of the Mind," the College Bowl originated as a radio show in 1953, and is now the world's longest-running general knowl­edge competition. Similar to Jeopardy, the College Bowl pits two teams of four students against each other, questioning them on a broad range of top­ics. 
Notre Dame joined the tour­nament in 1958, beating Georgetown 230-110. Though play has been sporadic since then, Notre Dame has made a name for itself in the competi­tion over the past five years and consistently ranked in the regional tournament, said Matthew Biergans, operations manager of LaFortune. Last year, the team placed first at regionals and ranked ninth of fifteen in the national competi­tion. 
The competition itself consists of two seven-minute rounds divided by a brief intermission. There are two types of ques­tions provided by the ACUI: "Toss-up" questions, which are addressed to both teams, and bonus questions, which are asked exclusively to the team that gets the "toss-up" right. Answering a "toss-up" question is worth 10 points, while bonus questions can earn the team a varying number of points, gen­erally 20-30, said Biergans. As with most quiz tournaments, the team with the most points at the end of the two rounds wins. 
Nineteen teams were original­ly in contention this year for the chance to go to regionals, but only four remain: "Alex Trebeks Without the Cards", "Cobra Kai", "Team #10", and "Team Fisher". They have progressed through the single-elimination tournament used by Notre Dame to whittle down the com­petitors, though most schools use either a round robin or dou­ble-elimination tournament. 
"We [Team #10] did it just for fun -we didn't even expect to win a game," said Nick Dobbertin, a member of Team #10. ''I'm a very competitive person, so the College Bowl appeals to my competitive nature. I played Mastersminds in high school, which is based on the College Bowl, and the biggest difference is that you have to buzz in so much quick­er." 
The winner of the Region 9 tournament will go on to the national tournament from April 23 to 25 at Auburn University­Montgomery.

A government survey of 3,182 pickup driv­ers found that those with passengers ages 1 to 12 were leaving air bags on 48 percent of the time. The government recommends that air bags be turned off for front seat passen­gers 12 and younger to prevent injuries because the bags deploy with such force.

Stritch was invaluable to the journalism program at Notre Dame, contributing to many publications during his tenure, beginning with student work for Scholastic and The South Bend Tribune and serving as mentor to many Notre Dame graduates pursuing careers in the field, including Collins him­self. 
Stritch joined Notre Dame as a student in 1930 and soon decided to make it his home. He graduated in 1934, received a master's degree and stayed on as a faculty member until 1978. 
For a large part of his time in South Bend, Stritch lived in Lyons Hall, where he gained the reputation of being one of the last of the "bachelor dons," a phenomenon that was com­ing to an end in the 1940s and 50s. Stritch was a lifelong bachelor and so devoted his time to the students. His door was always open to those look­ing for conversation or advice, even after he moved off cam­pus to a residence on North Eddy St. and ended his career as a professor. 
In 1971, Stritch was given the Faculty Award at Notre

"He always kept his mind going and always kept writing." 
Stritch wrote a number of books, including My Notre Dame: Memories and Reflections of Sixty Years. 
"He had an enormous sense of history," Collins said. "He wrote his history [in that book], and much of it was intertwined with Notre Dame's history. He was a great writer and a very witty man." 
A funeral service was cele­brated Monday at the Cathedral of the Incarnation of Nashville. A campus memorial Mass will be held at a date to be determined. Stritch is sur­vived by his older sister, Katherine Stritch.

LaFortune receives a lot of traffic from students who socialize and study in the space, as well as family members, alumni and prospective students. 
For these reasons, sena­tors voted to ask the admin­istration for renovations to the lounge area. However, according to an amendment added to the resolution by a 19-3 vote by senators during the meeting, the resolution also requests that the stu­dent government be allowed to play a part in the design of the renovated space. 
The Senate also received an update regarding the Council of Representatives from Keenan senator Dan Zenker, one of the Senate's representatives on the Council. Zenker reported that COR has been debating how officials on dorm coun­cils should be elected -on a combined ticket or a split ticket. He also said the coun­cil is currently trying to decide which Student Union body should have the power to approve the budget, a power previously given by the Senate to COR at its inception in the fall. 
Zenker asked for the Senate's input and affirmed that the four Senate repre­sentatives would vote in the COR meetings to represent the Senate's views on the issue. 
The issue was debated, with Senators arguing both sides. 
"The reason behind the [combined ticket] is to improve communication and efficiency," Cavanaugh sena­tor Jordan Bongiovanni said. 
"We need to get the best people for the job, and we can do that with a split tick­et," Howard senator Brin Anderson said. 
In the end, an unofficial vote was taken to see where the Senate stood on the issue. Senators voted 15 in favor of a split ticket, 2 in favor of a combined ticket, and 7 in favor of simply let­ting the dorms decide. 
On the issue of the budget, debate was short. Discussion centered around which body would be most unbiased in approving the budget, and whom the budget would most affect. 
"I really think if it's going to be the next year's budget, it should be approved by those it's going to affect," student body president Jeremy Lao said. 
In other Senate news:

"What I think is missing is a forum for dialogue," said Dickmann. "The gay students .. . don't have a voice." 
Dickmann went on to say that students are interested in forming a club that would present this forum. He asked senators to go back to their dorms and see where resi­dents stood on this issue. 
"See if this is something the Senate could support. See what the feeling is in your dorms," he said.

Altria posts $2.098 Q4 earnings 
NEW YOHK-Tobacco and food giant Altria Group Inc.'s fourth-quarter earnings rose 20 percent from a year ago, boosted by improved results in its domestic tobacco business and gains in its international business thanks to the weak dollar. 
Altria, the New York-based parent of the world's largest cigarette company, said Wednesday that it earned $2.09 billion, or $1.02 a share, for the October-December quarter. compared with $1.77 billion, or 85 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. 
Hevenues for the fourth quarter increased 10 percent to $20.7 billion for the maker or top-selling Marlboro cigarettes.

HOUSTON --lligher oil and natural gas prices helped ConocoPhillips, the nation's third-largest oil company, swing to a $1.02 bil­lion profit in the fourth quarter. 
Net income of $1.48 per share during the final three months of 2003 compared with a net loss of 63 cents per share, or $428 million, in the same period of 2002, when the compa­ny reported merger-related charges of $1.16 billion.

FCC sued over network costs 
WASHINGTON The Federal Communications Commission was back in court Wednesday with challengers who say its rules for telephone and Internet services unfairly restrict competition and give states too much regulatory power. 
The government requires regional phone companies to lease portions of their local net­works to competitors at wholesale rates. The companies -BellSouth Corp., SBC Communications, Verizon Communications and Qwest Communications -say that allows others to use their networks at artificially low prices. Meanwhile, competitors are challeng­ing rules that allow the regional companies to keep their high-speed fiber optic lines off lim­its to Internet rivals.

Stocks tank on Fed rate news 
Committee leaves rates unchangt:d, expects 'considerable period' of low interest 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Stocks fell sharply Wednesday as the Federal Reserve, shifting its stance on interest rates, signaled that an increase is coming. The Dow Jones industrials tumbled more than 140 points. 
After a two-day meeting, the Fed's Open Market Committee left rates unchanged, maintaining a 45-year low. But in a state­ment, the central bank dropped its previous word­ing that rates would be maintained for a "consider­able period." Instead, the Fed said, "with inflation quite low ... the committee believes that it can be patient in removing its poli­cy accommodation." 
"If you look through all the comments, they contin­ue to describe an improving economy," said Jack Caffrey, vice president and equity strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. "In the intermediate and longer term, this is constructive for equity markets, but short term, I think equity investors are likely to use this as another reason to lock in some of their prof­its." 
The Dow Jones industrial average finished down 141.55, or 1.3 percent, at 10,468.37, erasing nearly all its gains since the begin­ning of the year. 
Broader stock indicators also fell. The Standard & Poor's 500 index was down 15.57, or 1.4 percent, at 1 ,128.48, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 38.67, or 1.8 percent, at 2,077.37. 
"The Fed is slowly preparing investors for an increase in rates, but the important thing to remem­ber is that there continues to be a certain amount of slack in the economy, so this is still several months

away," said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at Spencer Clarke LLC. 
With a market fresh off of two months of major gains, Wall Street is primed for at least a pause, if not a pull­back, Sheldon said. "It'll be at least a couple of weeks, though, to see if this will mark a selloff or not," he added. 
Stocks were higher earli­er despite a Commerce Department report that said orders for durable goods were flat in December, raising ques­tions about the strength of the recovery in the manu­facturing sector. Analysts had been expecting a 2 per­cent increase in orders. 
Time Warner posted a profit after a loss a year ago from write-downs on its America Online unit, but the company missed ana­lyst estimates by 1 cent per share. Shares fell 85 cents to $17.96. 
Sony's earnings fell 26 percent from a year ago as the entertainment and technology giant restruc­tures its global operations, but the company gave a strong outlook for its music and consumer technology divisions. Investors responded by sending the stock 35 cents lower to $39.95. 
Tenet Healthcare Corp. plummeted $2.97, or 18 percent, to $13.16 as the company announced it would sell one-third of its hospitals. Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock from "neutral" to "sell." 
Procter & Gamble beat estimates by a penny on 22 percent earnings growth, but shares fell 56 cents to $98.62 on a disappointing first-quarter outlook. 
Amazon.com fell $3.78 to $51.96 after the company reported quarterly and year-end profits after Tuesday's close. The online retailer met analyst expec­tations and announced a debt buyback program. 
New York Stock Exchange specialist firm LaBranche & Co., under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the NYSE for skimming profits from the shares it manages on the floor of the Big Board, posted a profit of 7 cents per share before one-time charges, beating analyst estimates by a penny. Shares were down 43 cents at $10.26. 
Declining issues outnum­bered advancers by a 3-to­1 margin on the NYSE. Consolidated volume came to 2.41 billion shares, com­pared with 2.18 billion shares on Tuesday.

Judge orders Exxon to pay $6.75B 
Federal court awards p!Jnitive damages in 1989 Valdez spill; company to appeal 
Associated Press 
ANCHORAGE, Alaska -A federal judge on Wednesday ordered Exxon Mobil Corp. to pay about $6.75 bil­lion to thousands of Alaskans affect­ed by the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. 
The ruling is latest of several dam­age awards in the case over the past decade -the result of successful appeals in federal court by Exxon. The company plans to appeal again. 
Wednesday's ruling by U.S. District Judge Russel Holland ordered the Irving, Texas-based company to pay $4.5 billion in punitive damages and about $2.25 billion in interest. 

The money is to go to 32,000 fish­ermen, Alaska Natives, landowners, small businesses and cities affected by the 11 million-gallon spill in Prince William Sound. 
"We have now closed the trial court doors for the last time in this litigation after 15 years," said David Oesting, lead attorney for those who sued. "We're definitely on track to the end of the entire dispute." 
The judge had been ordered by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals court to reconsider the damages awarded in an earlier ruling in light of a U.S. Supreme Court decision last year about punitive damages. 
"This ruling flies in the face of the guidelines set by the appeals court," company spokesman Tom Cirigliano said. 
He said the 9th Circuit has twice vacated Holland's decision in the case. 
Holland reduced the Exxon puni­tive damages award to $4 billion a year ago after a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit sent the original $5 billion verdict back, saying it was excessive. 
Attorneys from both sides argued that the Supreme Court case sup­ported their damages claims.

Julio Iglesias still passionate 
Associated Press 
SUHFSIIJE. Fl.-At 60, Julio Iglesias is still pining for love. 
Passion, emotion, a smooth voice and sex-symbol status have made Iglesias the best­selling Latin male artist ever. But he says it's his fans' love that drove him to record a new album. 
"When you get to the 35-year mark in your career, you make albums for your fans to love you more, so they don't forget about you," Iglesias told The Associated Press during an interview at his waterfront mansion on an island north of Miami Beach. 
The father of seven ­including singing sons Enrique and Julio Jr. -is on a world tour for his album "Divorcio," his first since "Noche de Cuatro Lunas" in 2001. 
The title may seem strange for a lover, but the album's songs -Iglesias' trademark ballads plus lively cumbia and Caribbean rhythms -refer to divorce from worldly posses­sions, old acquaintances and bad memories. 
"Divorcio" sold 200,000 copies in Spain the day it was released, adding to Iglesias' career total of more than 250 million albums sold. And the master of crossover plans to record songs from the album in French, Italian and English, as he has done previously to expand his international appeal. 
Alexandra Lioutikoff. senior vice-president of Latin American membership for The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, said the worldwide market for Iglesias is "guaran­teed." 
"lie is like the flag for us," Lioutikoff said. "You have an artist whose first language is Spanish, but he's good and he reaches the people, and it doesn't matter in which lan­guage he's singing." 
Iglesias' popularity peaked in the 1980s with the album "Julio" and the hit duet with Willie Nelson, "To All the Girls I've Loved Before." 
Iglesias' ability to sing in English set him apart, opening doors for him among American listeners, Lioutikoff said. 
"In the American market, he's been taken seriously since the beginning," she said. 
Iglesias is supremely confi­dent when talking about his 35-year career. He is so certain of his appeal that he canceled a tour of Asia just to complete his U.S. promotional tour­knowing the late change won't affect his popularity there. 
''I'm the Latin artist who has been the most successful in history at representing the Latin culture. That's a title that I've earned after 35 years. The stylings of my words are immodest, but it's the truth. 
"I have spread 'Latinism' from Finland to China ... and I never want to lose that privi­lege." 
But reaching the heights of Latin music wasn't always on Iglesias' mind. 
As a young man, not only did he get a law degree, but he also pursued a dream of play­ing soccer for Real Madrid as a goalkeeper. However, his short­lived futbol career ended when a serious car accident left him unable to walk for two years. 
During his recovery, Iglesias wrote poems and set them to song, and the erstwhile soccer player who was rejected by the chorus in his Madrid high school fell in love with music. 
He landed his first recording contract and hit No. 1 in Spain for the first time in 1968. Since then, he has played in front of 100,000 people in Santiago, Chile; performed songs with Diana Ross, Paul Anka and Sting; won a Grammy; and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. 
"He came to my house and we recorded together and I played the guitar," Sting said in an interview. "He's an old style romantic crooner and he does it brilliantly." 
Iglesias finds it rewarding to have stuck around this long. He leans back in his chair, runs his fingers through his curious­ly jet-black hair and gets metaphorical about his career after a long day of interviews, evident by the empty wine bot­tle and barren cheese plate in front of him. 
"When the painting is hang­ing on your wall for a long time, you don't notice it. You get tired of it, even if it's a Picasso. When the next gener­ation inherits the painting, they sell it. I don't want to be sold." 
He's concerned about how he looks, asking, "You don't find me too bald, do you? Old, and bald, and with a belly?" He works out regularly and keeps trim, though his handlers did­n't allow photographers at the interview and the home was dimly lit on an overcast day. 
But Iglesias, ever the symbol of composure, nearly lost his wits in December on a Mexican television program. 
Lip-syncing "El Bacalao," Iglesias suddenly felt a cramp inching his way up his calf and thigh. He couldn't move his leg, and one pause would inform the world he was not really singing.

Judge: R. Kelly can't visit Michael Jackson 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO-R. Kelly won't be mingling with Michael Jackson during next month's Grammy festivities: A judge has ordered the R&B star, who is awaiting trial on child pornography charges, to stay away from the King of Pop, himself facing child molestation charges. when Kelly attends the awards. 
The Chicago-based Kelly has produced two songs for Jackson: the 1995 hit "You Are Not Alone" and last fall's "One More Chance." Kelly is nominated for two Grammys at the Feb. 8 cere­mony and had to get a judge's permission to attend the Los Angeles event; Jackson is not up for any awards and there are no indications that he even plans to attend the ceremony. 
Prosecutors and Kelly's lawyers said they never raised the issue of a meeting between Jackson and Kelly during a hear­ing this week about Kelly's trav­el. Cook County Circuit Judge Vmcent Gaughan made the edict on his own, they said. The judge was at a funeral Wednesday and could not be reached for com­ment. 
Kelly lawyer Edward Genson said Monday's ruling, first reported by the Chicago Sun­Times on Tuesday, was not a problem. 
"What's the dill'erence if some­one makes an order not to sec someone he didn't want to see in the first place?'' Genson asked. 
Kelly, already a Grammy win­ner, is nominated for best con­temporary R&B album l'or his double-platinum album "Chocolate Factory" and best male H&B performance. 
Kelly was arrested in June 2002 after a videotape surfaced that allegedly showed him hav­ing sex with an underage girl. He has denied the charges alleged in a 21-count indictment. 
Jackson has pleaded innocent to seven counts of performing lewd or lascivious acts on a child under 14 and two counts of administering an intoxicating agent, reportedly wine. He .was arrested in November.

Scandal in 'Catholic' colleges 
MANAGING EDITOR 
s~otr. B{odfu~hm 
ASsT. MANActNc Eol'roa Sheila Flynn 
At least 40 "Catholic" colleges, includ­ing Notre Dame for the third time, will sponsor or host public performances of the Vagina Monologues this term. My concern here is solely with the judgment exhibited by our leaders in allow­

Charles E. Rice
ing this play again at Notre Dame. 
Right or
These com­
Wrong?
ments, therefore, raise no issues relating to the students involved in the play. 
One object of the play is to desensitize people to the naming of female sex organs in order to discourage violence against women. The performers deliver monologues focusing on, and personify­ing, their sex organs. These contribu­tions to literature include a description of a group masturbation in a "vagina work­shop" run by "a woman who believes in vaginas." 
It describes how the participants mas­turbated with the aid of hand mirrors. Other monologists recount conversations with their vaginas. Another talks to her vulva. Others describe lesbian sexual acts. And so on, with abundant descrip­tion. Apart from this repudiation of mod­esty and reserve, the personification of a body part destroys the integrity of the person and invites the objectilication of women which can generate the violence the play purports to oppose. 
These and other aspects of the play ought to preclude its performance at Notre Dame. The most compelling rea­son, however, for opposing that perform­ance arises from the sex abuse scandal in the Church. 

The most highly publicized monologue describes the lesbian seduction of a 16­year-old by an adult as a "salvation" for the victim. 
In The Little Coochi Snorcher That Could, "a Southern woman of color" describes, among other childhood sexual memories, her encounters at age 16 with a "gorgeous 24-year-old woman. The child's mother agrees to the woman's request that the girl spend the night with her. (I omit explicit details.) 
'Tm scared, but I really can't wait. Her apartment's fantastic ... the beads, the fluffy pillows, the mood lights ... She makes a vodka for herself and then ... the pretty lady makes me a drink ... The alcohol has gone to my head and I'm loose and ready ... as she gently and slowly lays me out on the bed ... Then she does everything to me ... that I always thought was nasty before, and wow, I'm so hot, so wild ... I get crazy wild ... 
"Afterward the gorgeous lady teaches me ... all the different ways to give myself pleasure. She's very thorough. She tells me to always know how to give myself pleasure so I'll never need to rely on a man. In the morning I am worried ... because I'm so in love with her. She laughs, but I never see her again. I real­ized later she was my surprising, unex­pected, politically incorrect salvation. She transformed my sorry-ass coochi snorcher and raised it up into a kind of heaven." Eve Ensler, The Vagina Monologues (2001), 77-82. 
On Jan. 6, the Catholic bishops released their report on the efforts of the dioceses to correct the sex abuse prob­lem. The vast majority of cases involved the exploitation by priests of teenage boys in homosexual relations with vary­ing degrees of consent. The monologue recounting the seduction of a trusting 16 year-old girl by a 24-year-old woman she admires is the precise counterpart of the exploitation of male teenagers by priests that has ruined lives and rocked the Church. 
Sexual exploitation of a teenager by an adult is despicable, whether the partici­pants are both male, both female or mixed. No one has a moral right to pres­ent such an exploitation as a benefit to the victim. This is a very serious matter. 
In light of the ongoing scandal in the Church, it is totally inexcusable for any "Catholic" institution, and especially the University of Our Lady, to allow itself to be used as a public forum for a portrayal of the sexual exploitation of a teenager by an adult as a "salvation" for the vic­tim. 
Regrettably, the Notre Dame President and Provost have responded to com­
. plaints about this with academic banali­ties reflecting a politically correct paraly­sis of judgment. I hope that our leaders will reconsider this failure of judgment and will cancel this third performance. If not, all the responsible administrators, from the top down, should resign their administrative positions. If they do not resign, they should be removed. Baseball has it right: Three strikes and you're out.

Who should pay the price? 
The Jan. 26 U.S. District Court decision to dismiss a suit for reparations to be paid by companies formerly employing the use of slavery properly upholds the principles of accountabil­ity that are inherent in the American system. 
Under no previous circumstances have Americans been held accountable for crimes· committed by ancestors. We cannot expect today's generation to repair damages inflicted by people six generations past. 
A man sentenced to 20 years in Staff Editorial prison cannot serve 10 and pass the rest to his children. Such a course of action negates personal responsibili­ty. Should a court actually decide to Virginia Tech award plaintiff reparations for ances­tral crimes, the courts will become inundated with similar suits. The precedent could easily allow descendants of individuals who suffered social or commercial injustices to easily win such decisions. 
For example, we conceivably could see suits against German companies such as Volkswagen and Siemens, both involved in German wartime activities, by Jews in search of reparation for crimes committed during World War II. 
Furthermore, it stands to reason that any company over 150 years old is vulnerable to suit, as the nature of econom­ics left such companies to benefit from the institution of slav­ery. 
Such a precedent is simply preposterous. 
More relevantly, this particular suit's attempt to hold a publicly owned company, RJ Reynolds, responsible would have punished a group of stockholders potentially unrelated to company ownership prior to 1863. 
The principles this suit pursued defied commonly accepted norms of personal responsibility, and would wrongly hold men and women with no control of their past responsible. 
Even if the principle agreed with social norms, the result would be impossible to administer. More money would be lost in administration than would be awarded to the plain­tiffs. 
Individuals seeking reparation would do better to pursue the advantages and opportunities afforded by today's increasingly tolerant society. 
The district court did right to dismiss this case, despite not firmly closing the door. As such, ignoring the case was irre­sponsible; the issues demand firm judicial closure in order to protect Americans from a frivolous suit concerning their ancestor's admittedly heinous acts.

The views expressed in this column are those ofthe author and not necessarily those ofThe Observer. 
In the Jan. 27 Observer article "Campus, seminary react to priest scandal," Fr. Richard McBrien asserts that the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops' audit of its program for preventing sexual abuse by priests "could have been prevented if the Church has responded properly when allegations began coming to light over 25 years ago." According to McBrien, "some ... dioceses were not as forthcoming -and still are not-as they should be." 
McBrien insists that "the officials of the Church need to allow every rele­vant question to be placed on the table and discussed. Nothing can be ruled out of bounds." Nothing except the sexual misconduct committed by McBrien's good friend and theological soulmate James Burtchaell, and the con­cealment of that behavior by his other friend Daniel Jenky. 
Like Martin Luther, McBrien is a virulent anti-papist who loathes everything Homan Catholic from the cloth to virtual­ly all dogma. The incontrovertible evidence shows he also is a hyp­ocrite. 
McBrien indicts the Church and its leaders for not responding properly to the sexual abuse issue 25 years ago. That seems like an apt time to start. 
McBrien was head of Notre Dame's Theology Department in 1989-90 when he was advised that Fr. James Burtchaell sexually abused Notre Dame students during the 1970s and 1980s. Sec Observer, Vol. XXIV No. 64, p. 4 (Dec. 3, 1991). Burtchaell was a member of the Theology Department; McBrien was his boss. 
Given his current sanctimonious condemnation of the Church regarding clergy sexual abuse, one might assume McBrien, to use his words, "responded prop­erly" when Burtchaell's sexual misconduct was brought to his attention. To the contrary, McBrien concealed Burtchaell's conduct; he did not discipline him or remove him froni contact with students. In short, McBrien continued to put Notre Dame stu­
dents at risk of a known sexual predator. Although McBrien had knowledge of Burtchaell's crimes as early as 1989, Burtchaell's sexual abuse of Notre Dame students was not made public until late 1991. When asked about Burtchaell's serial sexual abuse of students after concealing knowl­
edge thereof for more than two years, McBrien refused to "com­ment on the matter." See 
National Catholic Reporter (Dec. 6, 1991). 
Remarkably, McBrien even refused to comment on Burtchaell's resignation. See Observer (Dec. 3, 1991). 
McBrien's silence simply can­not be reconciled with his demand that "every relevant question" be asked and that "(n]othing can be ruled out of bounds." Those questions include what McBrien knew and when he knew it, and why he failed to act when Burtchaell's sexual abuse of students was disclosed to him. 
Similar questions relate to Fr. Daniel Jenky's knowledge of Burtchaell's sexual abuse of Notre Dame students. At the time Burtchaell was preying on young boys, Jenky was the rector of Dillon Hall, where Burtchaell resided and where he committed his sins. There is compelling evidence that Jenky was aware of Burtchaell's conduct. Currently, Jenky is the Bishop of Peoria, Ill. 
In a recent interview with the Denver Post, McBrien asserted that the U. S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' Report failed to provide for the "punishment of bishops who knowingly moved abu­sive priests from parish to parish." Denver Post (June 9, 2002). Indignant, McBrien demanded "[tlhat oversight ... be remedied." 
Revealing his "true" Christian virtues, McBrien shrieked that "[s)everal bishops arc going to have to walk the plank. There will be no peace in the Catholic Church until some bishops pay the price." According to judge, jury and executioner McBrien, the "first down the plank should be ... Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston and Cardinal Edward Egan of New York-but there's room for several others." 
If McBrien had any decency or intellectual honesty, he would be fixing the blindfold for his good friend Bishop Jenky and lighting his last cigarette. McBrien's hypocritical refusal to respond to inquiries about his knowledge of Burtchaell's crimes is as morally bankrupt as his failure to call for the resig­nation of his good friend Jenky. 
Until McBrien applies the standards he demands of the Church to his friends and himself. he lacks moral standing to speak on this issue. His words are the empty rhetoric of an over-zealous apostate. Not coin­cidentally, McBrien is a bully who censors any inquiry into how his own "theological" opinions and thoughts have contributed to the allegedly high inci­dence of sexual abuse by Catholic clergy. 
Unfortunately for McBrien. he has been outed by Michael Rose in "Goodbye, Good Men," which links abuse by Catholic priests to the pabulum pawned off as "theology" by McBrien and his ilk.

The autonomous Ani goes it alone 
By JULIE BENDER 
Scene Music Critic 
Sixteen albums since 1990, and Ani DiFranco is still singing out on the fringes of pop culture. Unafraid of risks, this fiercely independent singer/song­writer refuses to follow the mainstream, and instead has made a name for her­self as a folkie feminist narrating with

theme of this song; DiFranco sings, "I let you sur­round me I I let you drown me I out with your din I and then I learned how to swim." Self-assured emotion closes the song with DiFranco's confident discov­ery: "I found I missed no one I just lis­tening to the swishing of distant cars."

"I dream in skin scented sentences I of a stronger faster fiercer you I and to each noun, verb and predicate I I dedicate a vivid hue," DiFranco sings, challenging her audience to "take an educated guess" about her. 
In her spoken word piece, "Grand Canyon," DiFranco's distinct enuncia­tion delivers a biting critique of the state of women's rights in America. "People," she says, "we are standing at ground zero I .of the feminist revolution I yeah. it was an inside job I stoic and sly I one we're supposed to forget I and downplay and deny."

ALBUM REVIEW 


J-Live tears up the underground rap scene 
By KENYATTA STORIN 
Scene Music Critic 
J-Uve is one of those emcees that only underground hip-hop heads tend to know about, but he deserves to be heard by all hip-hop fans. He can tell a tale as well as Slick Hick, is as innovative as Outkast and as confident as Jay-Z. lie is a rapper that will make you think, but without being too preachy or serious. Always Will Be may be short at eight tracks, but it is a fine edition to .!-Live's small but excellent music cata­logue. 
The New York underground rap scene first noticed J-Uvn in 1995, when he came brutal honesty about politics, love and self-identity. 
Autonomy has been a key theme for DiFranco, who in 1990 started her own record label, Righteous Babe Hecords, in a formerly dilapidated church in downtown Buffalo, N. Y. Keeping with her theme of independence, DiFranco's latest album, Educated Guess, is a solo work centered on the subjects of rela­tionships ending and self-discovery. In 
contrast to her recent albums, which have included funky beats and multi-instrument layers, Educated Guess is a paired-down, back-to­roots romp with DiFranco and her acoustic guitar. 
Paired-down by no means, however, implies a low quality album. As with all of her albums, DiFranco pours her heart and soul into her words and the intricate guitar on her songs. This album cer­tainly is all "Ani;" she is the sole artist behind all of the music, lyrics, record­ing and mixing. Made from 8-track, reel-to-reel equipment, the album has a vintage, homemade sound complete with back­ground noises, loose 
out with his first single, "Bragging Rights." Soon after, he prepared to come out with his full-length debut, The Best Part, with the backing of well-known producers Prince Paul, DJ Premier and Pete Rock. Unfortunately, due to illegal bootlegging, label shuffiing and some other problems, the album was delayed for several years. 
During this hiatus, J-Live made occasion­al cameo appearances on other albums, but spent most of his time working as an eighth grade teacher-not exactly the day job you would normally expect from an aspiring rap artist. The Best Part finally made its official release in 2001. but despite turning the heads of the New York underground, it did not garner much 
attention outside of the city. It would not be until his follow-up, All of the Above, that J-Live would finally be recognized by critics nationwide and acquire the respect he now holds today. 
Always Will Be is part of a two-part EP set with its counterpart. Always Has Been, a set of older tracks that J-Live created from 1995 to 1997. Unlike his previous work, J-Live not only raps but produces the entire album. Although it is regrettable that the two EPs are sold separately since they are so short, vir­tually every track on Always Will Be is a high­light. The average hip-hop album may be more than twice as long, but Always Will Be still has more quali-

ty material than the filler-infested garbage that often gets released these days. 
There are so many classic lines on the album that it is impossible to list them all. Sometimes he is clever, like on the upbeat opening track "Always Will Be," where he says: "Cut off my legs, you still have to face the rest of me I Tenacious, like the Terminator in The Matrix." Other times creative, like this tongue-twisting verse on the energetic "Add-A-Cipher:" "50 people in a 5 man elevator I freefalling from the fifth-thousand floor I 500 degrees Fahrenheit to a 5 minute song I Feeling like you can't go wrong." And he will even throw out a deep metaphor here and there, like on the surreal "9000 Miles:" "My mind speaks mathematics I Sometimes I feel English is a poor translation of my heart's palpitations" 
J-Live also keeps things fresh by using a number of different themes for his songs. "Add-A-Cipher" is a purely energetic, upbeat jam. "Deal Widit" is a little more serious by discussing how to deal with overwhelmingly busy days, and "Walkman Music" is a tribute to people who like to lis­ten to walkmans. But the best track that exemplifies J-Live's creativity is the classic conceptual track, "Car Trouble." In it, an aspiring rapper gets into a cab on his way to a record label interview, only to find J­Live as the driver. J-Live then goes on to tell the rapper about his past troubles with the record industry, convincing him to skip the interview. lie cleverly uses the concept of driving a car as a metaphor for being a rapper in the record industry. Can you imagine Ja Rule ever doing that? 

Although fans may have to wait a while until J-Live releases another full-length LP, the shOii Always lias Been should still bP enough to hold them over until then. It is a fine addition to any hip-hop collection, even if you have never listened to J-Uve before. He is a thinking man's emcee, but one that can lay it down with the best of them.

Jaron Brown had 18 points, with Taft adding 14, Krauser 12 and Julius Page 10. Uka Agbai led Boston College (13­6, 2-4) with 17. Craig Smith, the Eagles' top scorer with an 
18.4 average, had 16 but was held to six in the second half. Smith had scored 20 or more points in seven of nine games. 
The Panthers, coming off an impressive 21-point victory at No. 20 Syracuse, trailed in the second half for the third straight home game and their fourth in their last five overall, yet still found a way to stay unbeaten at the Petersen Events Center. The Panthers are 32-0 there since it opened last season. 
Boston College led by eight points in the first half. then used second-half runs of 8-0 and 6-0 to regain the lead at 55-54 on Jermaine Watson's tap-in with 3:47 remaining after falling behind 46-34. 
Krauser's runner off the glass restored Pittsburgh lead at 56-55 with 3:10 remaining, and he converted a three-point play with 1:37 left following a series of turnovers and missed shots to make it 59-55. 
Brown, who missed five con­secutive free throws until then, and Taft hit two free throws each on successive possessions, and Brown's steal and dunk finished off a stretch of 11 straight points during the decisive 14-3 run. Pittsburgh made eight of its final nine free throws after being 4-of-9 at the foul line with less than three minutes remaining. 
Taft also had eight points during the midgame run that began with Antonio Graves' basket just before halftime, and ended with Pitt scoring the first 12 points of the sec­ond half to open a 39-27 lead. 
The finish was much like that of the Panthers' 59-49

NFL 
Patriots learn from last year's disappointments 
A>sociatod Pross 
IIOUSTON -By failing last season, tlw New England Patriots set themselves up for SUCCPSS thL'i year. 
By improving last season, the Carolina Panthers built the l'ranwwork for their surprising Super Bowl run. 
Perhaps more than anything, those two clements provided the impdus and the drive for the two lPams who will face each other in Sunday's Super Bowl. 
The Patriots followed their 2001 championship season by not tWP!l getting into the playoff..'i -going 9-7. a monument to undtrachievenwnt. according to quartPrback Tom Brady. 
"Tiwn~ are a lot of things that havn to happen to win a whole hunch of thns~ games and to get back to the Super Bowl," he said WPdrwsday. "Because last year, I felt we had a better team than we had two years ago." 
Brady shook his head at the nwmory. lie believed last year's Pal"> were as capable of winning a title as the previous team that upsnl the St. Louis Hams fur the championship. 
I.ast year's struggles, however, forced the entire organization to take a closer look at itself, and bring in a strong defensive loader. safety Hodney Harrison. 
"We didn't play well enough, didn't coach well enough, all the way around," coach Bill Belichick said. "A lot of it was the sarnn players, the same division. similar schedules, but we just didn't play well enough offensive­ly. defensively. special teams.... We tried to address some of those things in the offseason and I think some of them have improved this year." 
Among the problems that were fixed were getting more balance into the offense and far more production out of the secondary on defense. They were fixed so well. in fact, that Brady and Harrison became two of the NFL's top playmakers this sea­son. 
That doesn't mean the Patriots are simply trying to recapture the past. 
The squad Brady led here is not much difl'erent than the '01 championship team, though it is probably deeper at receiver. a lit­tle younger on defense, and has the key addition of Harrison. 
"We never thought about, 'This is the way it was before, let's try to make it that way again,' " Belichick said. "This team is dif­ferent from that team. We need to draw on our strengths and weaknesses this year, and that's what we tried to <io. We had other strengths in '01, different strengths, dill'erent weaknesses, different style of play." 
The Panthers definitely didn't want to go back to anything resembling 2001, when they were the league's worst team, winning their opener and then losing 15 in a row. 
They hired John Fox to replace George Seifert as coach, then set about a rebuilding project that figured to take several years. 
Instead, according to his play­ers. it took just a few months. By the end of the '02 schedule, the Panthers were 7-9, winning four of their last five games. In the finale, they won 10-6 at New Orleans, which was playing for a playoff berth. 
Even an outsider -Jake Delhomme. then a backup quar­terback with the Saints ­noticed things coming together in Carolina. 


"The thing that stuck in my head was when Carolina beat us in the last game when we needed to win to make the playoffs and they had absolutely nothing to play for," said Delhomme, who signed with the Panthers as a free agent and became their starter in the opener. 'They won four of their last five. So, one. the coach kept the team together and they believed in his system. 
CheapStudent Airfar 


"The next thing was they must have some pretty good character guys in that locker room because too many guys would have packed it in and had their trucks running for that last game, wait­ing to go home." 
Now, they are waiting for Sunday, when the groundwork they set in place with that late­season flourish in 2002 could taken the Panthers all the way to a Super Bowl championship. 
"We definitely knew this could

happen when we fmished up that season." safety Deon Grant said. "The chemistry we established, showing we're dedicated to one another, that we got each other's back. 
'We had four games we lost by three points last year, and we knew we could tweak things and win those. We did. We went 7-0 in those this year. 
"We had a great ending last year." he said. "But not as great as it can be this year."

ucrazy Legs" Hirsch dies 
Associated Press 
MADISON, Wis. -After a long touchdown run for Wisconsin in 1942, Elroy Hirsch was described as looking like a "demented duck," whose "crazy legs were gyrating in six different directions all at the same time." 
From that day on, he was known as "Crazy Legs." He went on to become one of the NFL's most exciting play­ers and earn a place in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. 
On Wednesday, Elroy "Crazy Legs" Hirsch died at age 80. 
Hirsch had been living at an assisted living facility in Madison, said Wisconsin assistant athletic director Steve Malchow. 
"There has never been a more loved and admired ambassador for Wisconsin sports than Elroy Hirsch," Wisconsin AD Pat Richter said. "He loved life, loved peo­ple and

Wisconsin athletic director 
ing the 170-mile trip to Bloomington, Ind., to pitch the second game of a double­header in the afternoon. Hirsch was third in the broad jump, and his win over Indiana clinched the conference title for the base­ball team. 
"He was an outgoing, fun­loving, popular guy," said Don Lund, who played foot­ball, basketball and baseball with Hirsch at Michigan. "Everything about him as a man and an athlete was out­standing." 
Following his stint in the Marines, he played three seasons for the Chicago Rockets of the All-American Football Conference. 
He switched to receiver when he joined the Rams in 1949 and was a key part of their revolutionary three-end offense. He set records for catches, receiving yards and touchdowns as they won the title in 1951, the first of his three con­secutive Pro Bowls. 
After his 

for one season, played nine years in the NFL and led the Los Angeles Rams to the league title in 1951. He had a brief movie career, then eventually returned to Madison as the Badgers' ath­letic director from 1969-8 7. 
"Elroy Hirsch was a big star in a town of stars," NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said in a statement. "He was an electrifying player who brought a lot of glamour to the NFL." 
Hirsch's nickname remains one of the most recognizable in football. The Wausau native was inducted into four other halls -college foot­ball's Hall of Fame in 1974, two in his home state and Michigan's Hall of Honor. 
Born June 17, 1923, Hirsch led the Badgers to an 8-1-1 record in 1942, rushing for 786 yards. He was given his nickname by Chicago Daily New sports writer Francis Powers, who watched Hirsch's 62-yard TO run in a game at Soldier Field. 
His number 40 is one of four numbers retired at Wisconsin despite his single season there. 
Hirsch was assigned to Michigan in 1943 while serv­ing in the Marine Corps. He became the school's only athlete to win letters in four major sports in the same year -football, basketball, baseball and track. 
He once competed in the Big Ten outdoor track cham­pionship in Champaign, Ill., in the morning before mak­president. 
When he 
returned to Wisconsin as AD, the Badgers' football team had gone winless in 20 previous games. But he helped raise home attendance from 43,000 in 1968 -the year he went into the Pro Football Hall of Fame -to more than 70,000 per game in just four years. 
Before he retired in 1987, the department doubled the number of sports it offered and the Badgers won nation­al championships in hockey, men's and women's crew, and men and women's cross country. 
His movie career included the 1953 film biography "Crazylegs, All American," in which Hirsch played himself, "Unchained" in 1955 and "Zero Hour" in 1957. 
Wisconsin boosters put on an annual run called the Crazylegs Classic to raise money for athletic scholar­ships. Hirsch was the hon­orary starter every year. Since its inception in 1982, it has raised $4.2 million with more than 116,000 runners and walkers. 
Hirsch's survivors include his high school sweetheart Ruth, whom he married in 1946. He once said he tried out for the Michigan basket­ball team, in part, because the Wolverines had a road trip scheduled that year to Madison, where Ruth was still in school. 
Hirsch also has a son, Winn, and a daughter, Patty Malmquist.

Heatley m.akes debut after accident 
Associated Press 

ATLANTA -Dany Heatley's body has healed. His heart is another matter. 
It's only been four months since that awful night ­enough time, amazingly, for his right knee to mend from sur­gery, but hardly long enough to get over the pain of losing the friend everyone called "Snydes." 
That could take a lifetime. 

"I just keep remembering the guy," Heatley said Wednesday, a few hours before his first game of the season with the Atlanta Thrashers. "He was a great guy, a great teammate. I think about him every day." 
Heatley returned to the ice nearly four months to the day that his sports car slammed into a wall with teammate Dan Snyder riding in the passenger seat. Snyder died six days later from massive brain injuries without ever regaining con­sciousness. 
The near-sellout crowd at Philips Arena welcomed Heatley back with a raucous ovation. Among the signs: "We're With You Dany!" 
Heatley was the next-to-last Thrashers player to take the ice before the game against the St. Louis Blues. but he didn't have to wait long to get back in the game. He was in the start­ing lineup, taking his familiar place on a line with Slava Kozlov and Shawn McEachern. 
"I'm thrilled," said Laura Gervais, a Thrashers season ticket holder, sporting a replica of the sweater that Heatley wore while winning the "MVP award in last year's All-Star Game. ''I'm so happy to see him back." 

Less than 30 seconds after the puck dropped, Heatley put a shoulder into Blues defense­man Bryce Salvador along the boards. 
Late in the opening period, Heatley had two great scoring chances on a power play. He fired one shot over the net, then watched in dismay as Reinhard Divis made a great pad save with Heatley parked all alone in front of the net. 
After knee surgery, grueling rehab and a much-quicker­than-expected recovery, Heatley was trying to jump back on his rising star while lugging the burden of Snyder's death. 
"He's got a tough road ahead of him, there's no doubt about that," Thrashers goalie Byron Dafoe said. "He's still got a lot of hurdles to clear, but this is a huge hurdle he's about to leap over." 
Undoubtedly, getting back on the ice was a major step in Heatley's recovery process. For a few hours, at least, he'll be able to escape the memory of his Ferrari spinning out of con­trol on a narrow, winding street. 
Police estimated that Heatley was driving about 80 mph ­far above the speed limit -but prosecutors haven't decided whether to file charges. 
"I think he'll be OK," team­mate Slava Kozlov said. "When you step on that ice, you don't think about anything -just hockey. All your problems go away." 
"Hockey has been a big part of my comeback," he said. "It helped me a heal a lot."

"It's probably one of the most talented teams out there but it's young," he said. "It's going to be a continually learning process for the new guys." 
Accompanying the learning arc growing pains. Coach Janusz Bednarski has tried to 
ease the transi­tion into colle­giate fencing, but he knows that certain elc­men ts will always exist with a young team. 
"A younger team is always unpredictable," he said. 
One of the promising young stars of the men's team, freshman foilist Frankie Bontempo, showed just how mercurial youth can be. Entering Sunday's competi­tion, Bontempo had fenced his way to a near perfect 10-1 mark. On Sunday he finished with an uncharacteristic 6-9 record. 
"I lost focus a Jot," 
Bontempo said. "You really have to have the right mind­set that you can beat any­body." 
But Bontempo was not the only one who faltered. The team's unpredictability turned against them while facing a strong St. John's 
team. Traditionally a top finisher at the NCAA Championships, Bednarski called the Red Storm "the strongest [men's] team in the nation at the moment." On Sunday, the Irish found them­selves in the wrong place at the

wrong time. 
The end of the team's winning streak drew a lot of attention, marking the sta­tistical end of a three-year reign of dominance. Notable losses like this one can fester, eroding 
confidence, potentially to reversing the streak in the other direction. 
However, the upperclass­men are committed to pre­venting that from happening. Senior Matt Castellan, one of the few upperclassmen, stressed the need to keep the loss in perspective. 
"This is one loss," Castellan said. "The ultimate goal is to qualify all 12 fencers to the NCAA's. A Joss to St. John's isn't gonna make us say, 'We're not gonna win."' 
The team consensus seems to be that the weekend was a learning experience. Bednarski wants the negative

to push his fencers harder. He knows they cannot relax as there are big matchups in the upcom­ing weeks .. 
"We will have another strong team [Ohio State]. which consists of experienced fencers," 
said. "The 
response is to practice. We need some improvement in technique, in tactic. How long it takes, we don't know, but they are working." 
Castellan feels that the work will continue with a renewed vigor. 
"After the meet this week­end, you're going to see a much more focused team," he said. "And as the defending national champions, the goal remains the same, loss or no Joss. We're going for the repeat. We've done it for so many years, there's no reason to expect any less. Our goal is to be the best."

Team eyes upset over Michigan 
By ANN LOUGHERY Sports Writer 
The women's tennis team will open its spring season at No. 34 Michigan tonight. 
Last spring, the Irish finished 16-9, won a Big East title and made it to the second round of the NCAA Tournament. After attaining several individual tri­umphs during the fall, the No. 21 Irish hope to have similar success as a team. 
"Everyone is more focused on doing well as a team, because dual matches mean more in the scheme of things," said captain Alicia Salas. "The fall season is more individual­oriented because of tourna­ments." 
Coach Jay Louderback will look to several members of the talent-laden team to make con­tributions this spring. The Intercollegiate Tennis Association ranked Salas at No. 14 in singles and No. 39 in doubles with sophomore Lauren Connelly. The organi­zation also placed freshman Christian Thompson at No. 88. 
Other Irish gaining recogni­tion at the regional level include singles players Salas and sisters Christian and Catrina Thompson. The dou­bles teams of Salas and Connelly, the Thompson sis­ters, and Sarah Jane Connelly and Kristina Statsny were also ranked regionally. 
Michigan also brings ranked players to the meet. Freshman Elizabeth Exon is nationally ranked in singles at No. 37. and junior Michelle DaCosta is No. 92. DaCosta and teammate Leanne Rutherford also hold the No. 47 position in doubles. 
Already, Michigan stands at 1-0 this season after a 6-1 vic­tory over DePaul Jan. 17. The Irish hope to give the Wolverines their first loss of the year. If history is any indi­cation -the Irish won 5-2 last year -an Irish victory seems likely. 
"We're ready for a win," Louderback said. "The kids are ready to play someone besides themselves and are really get­ting into the competitive spirit at practices."

MEN'S BASKETBALL 


Quinn listens to coach's advice 
Exactly three minutes into Notre Dame's 72-62 win against Miami Wednesday night, Chris Quinn stopped his sprint down the left side of the court, caught a pass, and drilled a 3­pointer that sent the Joyce Center crowd into a frenzy. 
Another minute expired on the game clock, and Quinn again found himself all alone on the left side of the court with the ball in his hands. He launched another 3-point shot toward the basket, and watched as it hit exactly nothing -an ugly airball that caused the sopho­more's shoulders to briefly slump. 
On the Irish sideline, Irish coach Mike Brey grinned. Quinn was finally playing aggressively. 
"We had this thing in the game notes ... that he didn't have a turnover for five games," Brey said of Quinn's turnover-Jess streak earlier in the season. 
"Throw one in the band. Be more aggressive," the coach told his guard. 
So the sophomore did. And he picked a good night 

Andrew Soukup 
Sports Writer 
to do so. On a night where Chris Thomas struggled to score -something that nor­mally spells doom for the Irish -Quinn responded by han­dling the ball more and smoothly running the offense. 
The player, who Brey joking­ly referred to last year as "the 12-year-old," because that was exactly how old he looked, helped the Irish play more maturely. And it was about time, for Quinn had recently looked less like one of the bet­ter starters in the Big East and more like a so-so sixth man afraid to take stats away from the starters. 
If Notre Dame makes the NCAA Tournament, scholars may look back at the 10:17 mark in the second half as the point where the Irish discov­ered their identity. 
Earlier, Brey had already barked at Thomas for not passing the ball down quicker to Francis, who was simply abusing an undersized and undertalented Miami defense. 
But after one sickening play, where Thomas flipped an ugly something (it was hard to tell if it was a pass or a shot) off the backboard, Brey's ire was apparently sufficiently raised. 
Out came Thomas for his first breather in over 60 min­utes. In came a stretch where the Irish showed how good they can be. 
With their star point guard off the floor, Quinn calmly dic­tated the game. The player 

Quinn also put together a solid individual performance. All sea­son, Brey has tried to get Quinn to be more aggressive and not worry about 
turnovers coming from trying to cre­ate on the offensive end. Wednesday night Quinn did just that, driving to the hole, kicking it to  "We were able to put together a pretty good 40· minute stretch on the defensive end.,  out early and established Torin Francis in the post as Francis scored Notre Dame's first six points and had

who the Hurricanes defense was designed to contain was no longer on the court, and Miami looked lost. In a four­minute stretch with Thomas on the bench, Notre Dame stretched a seven-point margin into a 14-point lead keyed largely by stingy defense and Quinn's calm management of the game. 
By the time Thomas returned with 6:42 left, the game was all but over. 

Much like Notre Dame's win earlier this year against DePaul, when the Irish were reeling from losses against Marquette, Central Michigan and Indiana, Wednesday's win over Miami may have been a remedy the Irish needed to erase performances against Syracuse and Kentucky. 
At the center of Notre Dame's success Wednesday rested Quinn, whose steady combination of efficiency and aggressiveness gave the Irish a win they desperately needed. 
And Brey wants him to keep playing like that. Even if it means his sophomore guard fires more airballs. 
"I don't care," the Irish coach said. "Get on back, steal it, and shoot it again. 
"We need him to be aggres­sive."

Defensively, the Belles had trouble handling the Albion backcourt of Jaime Fornetti, Vanessa Thompson, and Jocelyn Zappala. Fornetti had 16 points and nine rebounds, while Zappala had 13 points, six rebounds, and six assists. Thompson added 11 points on 4 of 10 shooting. 
"Albion's guards played really well," Belles coach Suzanne Bellina said. "Their outside shooting was pretty good in the second half." 
Despite the offensive explo­sion from Fornetti, Thompson, and Zappala, the Belles successfully defended Albion's leading scorer, Sarah Caskey. Caskey was held to 5 points on 2-of-4 shooting. 
The Belles go into this weekend with a chance to regroup. They do not play any games this weekend, and it should give them a chance to put this loss behind them and prepare for next week's opponents. 
The loss Wednesday night moved the Belles to 5-13 overall and 0-7 in the MIAA. Their first league win could come on Monday.

Belles lose 62­44 at Albion 
By BOBBY GRIFFIN 
Spores Wrirer 

Saint Mary's fell short in their attempt to win their second straight game for the first time in over a month, as they lost 62-44 to Albion Wednesday night. 
In a game that was sup­posed to be played on Tuesday but was cancelled due to the inclement weather, Saint Mary's was run out of the gym in a game the Belles desperately needed to win. 
Albion jumped out to a 31­25 lead at the half, but the difference came early in the second half. The Britons came out strong and outscored the Belles 31-19 en route to their 18-point victo­ry. 
While only shooting 38 per­cent from the floor, Albion outrebounded the Belles 45 to 30, and had 12 steals on the defensive end. 
Despite the disappointing loss, the Saint Mary's bench made key contributions. Anne Hogan lead the Belles with 10 points on 3 of 8 shooting and Bridget Boyce added nine points on 4-of-9 shooting. Bridget Lipke con­tribued six points on 2-3 shooting, and had three
