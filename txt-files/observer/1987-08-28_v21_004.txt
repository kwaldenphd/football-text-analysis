In Brief 
An Alabama inmate who asked jurors in his murder trial to impose the death penalty then told his lawyers to stop their last-ditch appeals was electrocuted Friday, the first of four scheduled executions across the nation on the same day. Wayne Eugene Ritter, 33, who was convicted in the 1977 murder-robbery of a pawnbroker, was pronounced dead at 12:18 a.m., said John Hale, a state Corrections Department spokesman. In Utah, so-called "Hi-Fi'' killer Pierre Dale Selby was to die by lethal in­jection after 1 a.m., while Florida inmates Beauford White, 41, and Gerald Stano, 35, were to be electrocuted at 7 a.m. and 1 p.m. Friday, respectively. The execution of a Geor­gia inmate, William Mitchell, 35, also set for Friday, was postponed until Tuesday because his appeal would go before a federal appeals court in Atlanta. -Associated Press 
A jury that split 7-5 for acquittal in the Jello Biafra pornography case in Los Angeles declared itself dead­locked Thursday and the judge dismissed all charges against the punk-rock music star. As the judge announced there would be no retrial on the charges, the 29-year-old Biafra leapt to his feet screaming, "Yes! We got it!" and ran out of the courtroom into the hallway. Municipal Judge Susan Isacoff suggested Biafra and his co-defendant had learned a lesson from the prosecution, which centered on a sexually explicit poster enclosed in a record album. ­

A near collision of a Soviet airplane and an American jet fighter over the ocean 20 miles southeast of New York was reported Sunday by a Soviet airline pilot, and a U.S. official said Thursday there is no evidence the incident occurred but refused to rule it out. Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said Thursday in Moscow that the Aeroflot pilot "noticed a fighter plane flying at the same altitude on a head-on course." "The fighter then veered to the left at a high speed and passed at a distance of 50 to 100 yards from the airliner," he said.

Delivering pizzas is hard work for the dough 
"Hey, pizza man! Got an extra?" 
This is the time of year that pizza sales in 
South Bend pick up tremendously, as students discover t~e delights of ~he Dining Ha_ll and the 
meat burntos at "MexiCana, Ltd." JUst don't fill the tummy like Mom's home cooking used to. And how long can one live on stale Pop-Tarts 
and an occasional bag of popcorn?Of course, we all have to deal with the pizza man to get our pizza. Snicker a little bit as the Domino's guy runs to the door. Give him a hard time about the 30-minute guarantee. Tip? What tip? But have you ever tried delivering pizza? I am proud to say that I am a pizza man, after two stints at Domino's and the ever­popular Red Bank Pizza, which delivers pizza to Bruce Springsteen, among other people. I'll bet you think the job's a piece of cake, right? All the free pizza you can eat, right? Sit around a lot, right? Wrong. The weirdest things happen to pizza men. Like the time I was called to the intensive care 
ward at the local hospital. I walked into the room, pizza in hand, and the patient offered me a joint. "Hey, how's about getting me a six­
pack? I give you some reefer, man? It's goooood, man!" Unfortunately, I wasn't 21 at the time. 
One time I had a 25 pizza order to an elemen­tary school. They said they wanted to feed their classes pizza for Arbor Day or something like that. So I stuffed my poor little Toyota full of pizza and drove off to the school, only to be told, "We've changed our mind. We don't want any pizza." What do you do? Four pizza drivers can polish off the occasional bad order, but 25 pizzas? 
We had someone calling himself "Allah" come in and order pizza once. He promptly started a gang war out in front of the store. He didn't get his pizza. 
Of course, there's the usual assortment of attack-trained Saint Bernards, houses with no house numbers, drunk parties, and couples fresh out of bed who show up at the door in towels and bathrobes. Not to mention the abso­lute idiots on the road who drive less than ten above the local speed limit. Don't they realize that starving people are waiting for their hot pizza? Not to mention the starving driver waiting for a tip that may never arrive. 
The local police, strangely enough, are more a help than a nuisance. They don't seem to see us speeding through the local roads, though that · might have something to do with the fact that most of us have fuzzbusters and the cops get free pizza. And when you're carrying a couple

of hundred dollars in accumulated cash on you and your car breaks down in front of a burned­out high school at 11:00 at night, they are aw­fully nice to have around. 
It is definitely a male profession, for precisely tha~ reason. Sexist that may be, but would you ladtes really want to deliver to the Pine Tree Liquor Store'fruck Stop at 2:30a.m.? 
It really is a good job, though, or else I wouldn't have gone back. The money is good, around ten dollars an hour if you're fast. It's definitely a challenge, especially when there's four pizzas on the rack with eleven minutes to deliver them all. If you're good, you'll make it. The not-very-good ones don't last long. With the first driver back getting his pick of the next run, the bad guys don't last too long. 
So the next time you order pizza, give the guy a break. He has to wear polyester. He has to run to the door. And he has to make an honest b~c~. Pizza men make horrendous flat pay ­mmtmum wage, usually. Their tips are their bread and butter. It's a real drag to drive like a madman through traffic and run halfway ~cross a campus full of college students laugh­mg at you only to get no tip. What's a buck on top of a ten dollar pizza? Be generous. 
Or next time he might drop your pizza.

Poindexter seeks to retire with respect 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-Former Na­tional Security Adviser John Poindexter has asked to retire from the Navy, wanting to leave "with his head held high" and before any Iran-Contra in­dictments are returned, a friend said Thursday. 
Poindexter requested that he be allowed to retire at the rank of vice admiral, which he held while working at the White House, rather than the rear ad­miral's rank he was reduced to upon leaving his post when details of the Iran-Contra affair were disclosed last November, Pentagon sources said. 
Such a request would have to be approved by President Reagan and then confirmed by the Senate. 
During the congressional hearings to investigate the af­fair, Poindexter testified he kept Reagan in the dark about the diversion of Iranian arms­sales profits to the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan Contra guerrillas. He also said he destroyed a presidential document aut­horizing the Iranian arms sales as a weapons-for-hostages transaction, fearing political embarrassment if it should be­come public. 
Retired Adm. Clarence 
"Mark" Hill Jr., a friend of 
Poindexter's and trustee of his 
legal defense fund, said Poin­
dexter "is very concerned 
about the image of the U.S. 
Navy." 
He said Poindexter wanted to leave the service before Iran­Contra Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh obtains grand jury indictments, which Hill said he expected would name Poindexter. 
"He said he left the hearings with his head held high," Hill said of Poindexter. "He's in the position to do that from the Navy now ... I think it makes good sense." 
Hill also said Poindexter faced an "extremely difficult" prospect of trying to win a Navy job carrying three-star vice admiral status now, given his role in the affair and the possibility Senate members could block his appointment. 
Poindexter has no job lined up and will probably spend a year or so before deciding what sort of work he wants to pursue, Hill said. 
The Navy refused to discuss the matter in any detail Thursday, but did confirm that "Adm. Poindexter has an­nounced his intention to

Reagan: We'll keep aiding Contras 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -President Reagan told leaders of the Nicaraguan Contras Thursday that "we intend to see that you have adequate funding" until a cease-fire is achieved. 
Reagan, seated with mem­bers of the directorate of the rebel force at a round table in the Century Plaza Hotel, said, "We have much to thank you for. The political and military pressure you've applied, I think, is showing results." 
"The Sandinistas have now signed a peace agreement based on democracy in Nicaragua," he said. "Without the freedom fighters, they will have no incentives to imple­ment the (reform) measures they have said they will imple­ment." 
The six members of the civil­ian directorate governing the Nicaraguan Resistance organi­zation traveled here to confer with Reagan, their most visible supporter, after signaling a willingness to see U.S. military aid suspended in the interest of peace. 
Administration officials have said they will not submit a re­quest to Congress for new aid for the Contras before Sept. 30 -the deadline advanced in a U.S. peace plan for the leftist San­dinista government in Managua to show its readiness to institute democratic

Associated Press 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -The nation's largest mining company Thursday fired more than 18,000 striking black miners, including 3,000 who staged a sit-in a mile un­derground, after their union voted to continue an 18-day-old walkout. 
The country's largest black labor federation, the Congress of South African Trade Unions, said it was considering a na­tional strike and other "solidarity action" unless the mineworkers' wage demands were met. 
Anglo American Corp., the company worst hit by the strike, said it fired about 18,400 gold and coal miners for defying back-to-work ul­timatums. Anglo last week 
Fulbright grant received 
Brendan Dooley, visiting il}­structor in history at the Uni­versity of Notre Dame, has been awarded a Fulbright scholarship grant for research at the University of Venice, Italy, for six months between September, 1987 and June, 1988. 
Dooley, who obtained bac­helor's and master's degrees from Syracuse University in 1976 and 1978 respectively, joined the Notre Dame faculty two years ago. Approximately 1000 Fulbright Scholars will go abroad to lecture or conduct re­search during the 1987-88 aca­demic year. 
Established in 1946 by legis­lation introduced by former Arkansas Senator J. William Fulbright, the Fulbright Schol­arship Program is adminis­tered by the U.S. Information Agency with funds obtained from congressional appropria­tions and the governments of 27 other nations. 
fired 7,000 strikers, and said 14,000 more face dismissal if they do not return to work Sat­urday. 
Among those dismissed were 3,000 men who staged an 18­hour sit-in inside Anglo's West­ern Deep Levels gold mine. Anglo did not say why the men staged the protest, but the Na­tional Union of Mineworkers said the men were forced un­derground Wednesday night by mine security. 
The strikers were brought to the surface Thursday after­noon, given their final pay checks and driven off the mine compound in buses, some of the miners said. 
The mass dismissals came after union members voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to reject an industry proposal that offered slight improve­ments in benefits but no addi­tional pay. The union said it would accept a 27 percent paY. raise, instead of its previous demand of 30 percent, but the Chamber of Mines refused to alter its already implemented increase of 15 to 23 percent. 
With the strike again dead­locked, the Congress of South African Trade Unions -of which the miners' union is the largest affiliate -announced a series of steps it would take in support of the miners. 
Jay Naidoo, general secre­tary of the 750,000-member congress, said international trade unions might be asked to order members not to handle South African coal and gold.

Security

year on the roads surrounding 
campus "prompted us to re­
examine the whole issue (of in­
creasing security's author­
ity),~' said Rakow. 
He also cited the construction 
of the new athletic facilities 
along campus roads as contri­
buting to the decision to change 
the policy. "The building that's 
going on increases the amount 
of students walking ... We 
gotta get traffic slowed down 
for pedestrians to have a fight­
ing chance to cross the street." 
Rakow said the jurisdiction of the Notre Dame security of­ficers extends to any roadways adjacent to campus. Among these roads are Angela Boulevard, Notre Dame Ave­nue, U.S. 31, and Douglas, Dorr and Juniper Roads. Drivers will be stopped for violations such as reckless driving, drunk driving, stoplight violations, and excessive speed, said Rakow. 
"We're responsible to reduce the flow of traffic to a safe level," Rakow said. "We want everyone to come back next year, unless they graduate." 

The previous system allowed security officers to stop traffic violators but not to issue cita­tions, Rakow said. Instead the officers would obtain the nec­essary information from the driver and would then file a probable cause affidavit, he added. The affidavit would then be processed through the county prosecutor's office to determine whether or not a violation actually had been committed. 
If the driver did violate a law,· then charges would be made against the offender, said Rakow. The entire process could take up to three months, Rlkow added, but with the new authority given to security of­ficers it should be streamlined down to around a month. 
Rakow said the increased au­thority will only apply to Notre Dame security and not Saint Mary's security. One-third of Notre Dame's security officers are certified police officers, and these will be the officers permitted to issue tickets, he explained. Saint Mary's secur­ity officers, on the other hand, do not have official police au­thority.

North 
continued from page 1 
Earl, in his testimony, said that in North's interview with Meese on Sunday, Nov. 23, North was confronted with evidence of the diversion. North, according to Earl, related that he asked the attor­ney general, "Since you didn't warn me of my rights ... does this count?" 
Earl also described helping North destroy documents cru­cial to the Iran-Contra affair and helping secretary Fawn Hall conceal other documents in her clothing to sneak them out of the White House. 
"I erred on the side of destruction," Earl said. 
Earl testified under a grant of limited immunity, meaning his words cannot be used agaisnt him in any court case. His testimony was obtained in four private depositions last May with staff lawyers of the congressional Iran-Contra committees and was released in a censored, declassified 
form. Also released was tes­timony by another North aide, Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Craig Coy, given in March and June. 
More closed-door testimony is expected to be released next week, including that of aides to Vice President George Bush. 
Earl's description of North's encounter with Meese on Nov. 23, two days before the diver­sion and North's firing were an­nounced, suggests North was mindful of potential criminal ramifications of his role in the arms-profits diversion.

Simple goodness marks retirement 
"How was your summer?" 
Aren't we all a bit annoyed with ths question at this point? I have adopted the tactic of cheerfully responding, "Terrible! And yours?" Presymbolic language be damned. 
Matthew Slaughter 
and another thing 
What happened this summer? 
Well, let's see. Ronald Reagan managed to suffocate any remaining breath of life in his presidency by emerging from the Irangate hearings a shadow of his former regal self. United States foreign policy continued to bumble along, reacting instead of in­itiating, as the Navy sent a sizeable con­tingency of its mighty 600 ship fleet to the Persian Gulf, only to fall prey to that most deadly of weapons, the 1907 floating sea mine. The Cleveland Indi­ans crashed and burned; the Minnesota Twins soared. 
But what really happened this sum­mer? 
Mrs. Bishop retired. My fourth-grade teacher has, after twenty-five years, called it quits. Let me tell you about Mrs. Bishop. Slie was an institution in and of herself at St. Therese School. Sister Infant Mary was fair, but only in the sense that she threw chalk at everyone. Sister Theresa Margaret was a stickler for penmanship, and believed religiously that writing "I will not throw snowballs" 500 times would indeed affect a noticeable improve­ment. Sister Janey was the one who talked during choir practice and saw that the proper authorities WPre notified. Mrs. Bishop was different. 
Mrs. Bishop never punished us; she never had to. We students simply loved her. Something about her suppressed the little helion in every fourth-grader beneath that budding civilized human. In short, she had mastered the skill of making learning fun for us kids, a most rare ability indeed. Her true passion was astronomy. Her son Steve became interested in the stars at an early age, and she was swept up in his enthusiasm. Her favorite time of year was when astronomy was the science topic at hand. She'd drive us to her house during recess to show us the telescopes her son had made. She helped us make gigantic paper mache models of the solar sys­tem, allowing us the liberty of spaces­hips, dinosaurs, and other assorted per­sonal touches. She gave us shoeboxes with which we could look at the sun. And she even invited us over to her house one fine evening to inhale bowls of buttered popcorn and gaze at Saturn's rings. "Remember children," she would say, "you're on one end of the telescope and God's on the other end." Newton and his Enlightenment pals could not have put it better. 
I was so captivated by all this that Christmas I demanded Santa Claus bring me my very own telescope. Ed­mund Scientific Company came

through; I was ecstatic. Night after night I fumbled around my backyard, usually discovering nothing but clouds and mosquitos. Nevertheless, I loved it. But time saw my interest wane, and the telescope began to compete with the beer can collection for the basement's dust. 
One day this past summer, my dad aroused me from a restful slumber on the hammock to announce that we were going to Mrs. Bishop's retirement din­ner. I was less than pleased; the tee 
time had to be cancelled. Reluctantly, 
I donned my Sunday bests and it was 
off to the St. Therese auditorium. 
It was amazing. People came from everywhere-and they kept coming. Everything started late because people kept coming: relatives, friends, col­leagues, parents of former students, and, most important I think to Mrs. Bis­hop, the former students themselves. Refreshments were served, songs were sang, speeches were given. And then Mrs. Bishop spoke. She thanked every­one for everything, and, holding back the tears, said she'd miss the children the most. Her voice faltered, and some­one began to clap. Then a wave of ap­plause arose which simply did not sub­side. We all stood, expressing our appreciation for all she had done, while at the same time, realizing what a great loss her departure would be. The fes­tivities ended, and I felt extremely glad I had gone. I even caught myself drag­ging out my telescope once or twice thereafter to take a peek at God. 
Before we all rush off to the bookstore in existentialism, the third world debt crisis, and the fascinating world of dif­ferential equations, I thought it would be a good idea to take a breath and thank Mrs. Bishop for all she has done. Everyone has a Mrs. Bishop or two in their lives, and we must remember not overlook them for more "important" people such as Plato, the Ayatollah, and Kirby Puckett. What happened this summer? Mrs. Bishop retired. Enjoy your newly-found freedom. And thank you again.

sense of unworthiness-­
religion Itself was part of the 
distraction. Worries about 
what you would eat. how 
much you would drink. and 
where you would find a clean 
bathroom In Europe were 
temporarily forgotten In the solemnity of chants and 
rituals that touched all the 
senses. 
Then, "Ave Marla" was sung as a final anthem, and the ministers and servers of the Mass turned to face the statue of the VIrgin. Suddenly, every­thing that had happened coalesced Into a conscious­ness of grace that was an In­tuition of the truth, underlying mysteries, and the power of holiness was overshadowing the heart and mind. You were left breathless with an ap­preciation of the faith sym­bols of the Mass, and the ca­thedral, and of devotion to the Queen of heaven to whom hymn sung by student voices I know from home. The hymn was half an answer to my prayer, and a sign that God was close, offering me an In­sight Into the meaning of the pageantry with which crea­tures come to adore Him In His holy temple. 
Transfiguration trips are hard to describe adequately; mine wasn't such a classic that you need to hear about It; perhaps It was totally emotional, un­worthy of God's notice; but I believe He allowed me a religi­ous experience. Since I fly blind so often that belief pleases me. Perhaps you fly blind, too. UND, as you can tell from the saints and statues, regards Itself as a holy place, where an experience of God could be a part of the educa­tion. So you pray at the Grotto, go to confession, and attend Mass every week; and you walt for the sun to dance, or the 
miracle to happen, or for your soul to be bathed In light. Nothing happens worth writing homw about. You join a prayer group, read the Bible, and hope to start speaking in tongues; again, the Holy Spirit disappoints you. You can walt until you graduate for someone to tell you how to make God start happening In your life. Nobody will, and perhaps nobody can, not even the born­again Christians. The born­agains may be sincere; but their shortcuts to salvation can leave you disappointed or embittered. 
The "Jews For Jesus" were In London, evangelizing Oxford this street this summer; they said: "Hello, reverend: have you accepted Jesus as your per­sonal saviour?" I've accepted Jesus as my Saviour a couple of hundred times; It's never been clear If He accepted me as a sinner. I could say:"''m washed In the blood of the lamb. Glmme a cigarette." The "Jews For Jesus" don't believe In cigarettes or whiskey; and they don't believe in me as a born-again as long as I have a taste for either. The "Jews For Jesus" offer cheap grace from the Cross; but cheap grace never heals me in the way they promise. Accepting Jesus as my personal saviour Is another act of blind faith, which leaves me as half-dead In my sins as I always was. 
Prometheus stole fire from the gods; he must be the role model of the televangelists preaching religion. They offer to do for you what only God can do: forgive your sins; heal your sickness; give you victory over the grave; deliver you blessings ·If you will send 

them money. 
One preacher was keeping his dead mother packed In dry Ice, until he could bring her back to life like Lazarus. They entitle their programs "the hour of power." They go on stage as self-proclaimed miracle workers. They put on performace In which they seem to manipulate God In helping them Jive up to their billings as stars. 
God has promised to be present where two or three are gathered. He commands us to serve Him through our kind­ness to the least of His breth­ren. He says that It's a lie to say that we love Him, unless He Is first visible to us In our neighbors. 
Does God "happen" at Notre 
Dame? he Is present to us In 
the holiness of other people. 
We may want His glory to be 
naked before our eyes or to 
feel Him In some premeditated 
way that leaves us feeling 
drunk. But the hidden God Is 
more Indirect: He could If He 
wished, shake down the stars 
before our eyes, then then fling 
them back to their places In 
the heavens. Instead, He Is 
quietly present In the love we 
feel at Mass, or In the peace He 
leaves with us when He for­gives our sins. Answers to prayer usually have ambiguity In them; divine Intervention can look like a series of happy colnclndencs. In so much that happens, the unexplainable occurs which you can't really pinpoint; the Glee Club slings, and their performance climaxes In an unbearable Intensity that Is more than the sum of the talents of the members. You are left wanting to pray In thanksgiving. because for a moment you are not flying blind. 
can you make God "happen" at Notre Dame? You can be present to your neighbor In a way that leaves you open to God's use. Your thoughtfulness can make your neighbor feel less lonely, because God sup­ports your human warmth with His spiritual warmth. Thomas said, "Show us the Father." Jesus answered, "He who has seen me has seen the Father." The neighbor who has met the one whom Jesus sent --on an errand of mercy, to lend a hand, to speak an encouraging word --has seen Jesus. 
Why Is Notre Dame a special place? Because we are reminded so often to be con­scious of Jesus. When we have that awareness, we are Jesus­people united by the tie that binds, and God happens In us, through us, with us. Every year, the graduates say, "Notre Dame Is special because of the people." This Is another way of saying that the campus Is a religious place.

AL Roundup 

Lloyd Moseby and the Toronto Blue Jays downed Oakland, 9-4, Thursday night to move into a first-place tie with Detroit in the AL East. 


Royals earn Wathan victory in first game 
Associated Press 
KANSAS CITY, Mo.-George Brett homered with two outs in the bottom of the lOth inning to give the Kansas City Royals and new Manager John Wathan a dramatiC 3-2 victory over the Texas Rangers Thursday night. 
Brett hit his 17th homer on a 2-1 pitch from reliever Dale Mohorcic, 6-4, who came off the disabled list earlier in the day. John Davis, 3-0, pitched 1 V3 in­nings for the victory. 
On Thursday afternoon, the Royals fired Billy Gardner as manager. Wathan, who was in his first year as manager of the Royals' Class AAA team at Omaha, was given the job after it was turned down by coach Hal McRae, the team's batting instructor and former desig­nated hitter, General Manager John Schuerholz said. 

Gardner took over the Royals when Dick Howser resigned Feb. 23 because of a brain tumor. Under Gardner, the Royals were 62-64, fourth in the American League West. 
Jays 9, A's 4 
TORONTO -George Bell drove in five runs with a grand slam and a double and Jimmy Key pitched two-hit ball for six innings as the Toronto Blue Jays defeated the Oakland Ath­letics 9-4 Thursday night. 
The victory moved Toronto into a first-place tie with the idle Detroit Tigers in the Amer­ican League East while the A's slipped a game behind the Min­nesota Twins in the AL west. 
Key, 15-6, allowed two hits and four runs in the first before getting an out and then retired 18 straight batters. Key missed his last start because of a tired arm. Mark Eichhorn, Jeff Mus­selma~ and Tom Henke pitched the last three innings, allowing no hits. 
Trailing 4-1 in the fifth, the Blue Jays' Fred McGriff and Nelson Liriano walked against starter Steve Ontiveros, and reliever Greg Cadaret, 3-2, walked Tony Fernandez to load the bases. Bell followed with his 39th homer of the season.

Murray, who also had three singles, led off the second in­ning with his 28th homer of the season to tie the score 1-1. 
Murphy's HR, Smith's arm lead Braves over Cubs 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -Dale Murphy's two-run homer, his 35th, backed the six-hit pitching of Zane Smith to give the Braves a 5-2 victory over Chicago in the opening of a doubleheader. 
The second game was suspended in the top of the eighth becaue of darkness with the Cubs leading 8c6 and will have to be completed at a later date, although the two teams are not scheduled to meet again this year. All the records count, including the five home runs by the Cubs. 
Smith, 14-7, walked one and struck out three as the Braves stretched their winning streak to five games in the opener. It was Smith's first victory over the Cubs, the only National League team he had not defeated. 
The game was tied 2-2 when Gerald Perry led off the fifth with a triple off loser Jamie Moyer, 10-11, and scored on Gary Roenicke's sacrifice fly. 
In the second game, Leon Durham hit a pair of two-run homers and Jerry Mumphrey, Keith Moreland and Andre Dawson also homered to give the Cubs an 8-6 lead. 
It was Dawson's 14th homer this month, breaking a 57-year­old Cub record.

Streak may be done, but Molitor still going 
r----------~---------------------------------------------------------~------------------------------~--------------~-----------­
Friday, August 28, 1987 The Observer page 11 
Associated Press 
MILWAUKEE-Paul Molitor showed no sign of a letdown a day after his hitting streak was ended at 39 games. 
He had a double and a single as his Milwaukee Brewers beat the Cleveland Indians 4-3 Thursday. 
Before the game, Molitor obliged the Cleveland rookie pitcher John Farrell, who stopped the streak Wednesday night, and presented Farrell with the autographed baseball he had requested as a souvenir of a "fantastic week." 
"It's a piece of nostalgia and I wanted a physical object to remember it by," Farrell said. 
"Wishing you a great career. My best always," Molitor wrote on the baseball that Far­rell cradled in his glove. 
"Things have happened real fast to me and it just hasn't sunk in for sure," said the 25­year-old Farrell, who held Molitor hitless in four at-bats while making only his second major league start. 
"I was just fortunate to be presented with that situation. Everything just worked out. It could have been coincidence. I was just in the right spot at the right time." 
The end of Molitor's streak, one that began July 16, came as he stood in the on-deck circle watching teammate Rick Man­ning single in the winning run in the lOth inning. 
Manning's hit won the game 1-0, but because it denied Molitor a fifth at-bat, it drew boos from a County Stadium1 crowd of 11,246. 

Molitor said that "it was against human nature" for the crowd not to want him to keep the streak going, even though the Brewers had taken a bit­tersweet victory. 
"In a lot of ways the personal streak seemed more important (for them) than the win itself. 
"It's impossible not to be a little split, but there is no way po~sibly you can be disap­pomted when the guy in front of you drives in the winning run," he said. 
Manning, who has only 86 at­bats this season, said, "I played a long time and I've never seen anything like that. There were sort of mixed emo­tions in the stands. People were booing and some were happy. 
Molitor's streak is fifth longest in baseball history be­hind Ty Cobb, George Sisler, Pete Rose and Joe DiMaggio.

League postpones draft 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK-The NFL's Cris Carter-Charles Gladman sup­plemental draft was postponed for a week Thursday after Commissioner Pete Rozelle and a group of college athletic directors agreed to give the NCAA a chance to reinstate the college eligibility of the two players. 
The NFL said in a statement that Rozelle cited as the reason for the postponement of Friday's draft the reinstate­ment Wednesday of another Pitt player, defensive back Teryl Austin, who like Carter had accepted payments from 
agents Norby Walters and 
Lloyd Bloom. 
The reinstatement is contin­gent on Austin repaying $2,500 in loans he received from the agents and severing any agree­ment with them. The same stiuplation would apply to Carter. 
Gladman, however, has never acknowledged any dealings with agents. He was ruled ineligible for refusing to cooperate with an investigation into Walters and Bloom. 
Friday's supplemental draft, however, will still take place for four other players uni­nvolved with agents. 
Carter, meanwhile, was holding a news conference in Indianapolis unaware of the postponement. 
He said he that playing for Ohio State would be his first choice. 
"I'd love to go back but it's just not as easy as that," he said. 
Asked if he might seek reinstatement from the NCAA, carter's lawyer, Bob Berry, said "Ohio State would have to appeal and they have no inten­tion of doing that. Without Ohio State appealing the decision we are dead in the water.'' 


Carter wants to be a Buckeye 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS All-American wide receiver Cris Carter said Thursday he would rather play football for Ohio State during the upcoming season than with an NFL team. 
"I would love to go back. But it's just not as easy as that," Carter told a news conference held before the NFL announced it was postponing Friday's Carter-Charles Gladman sup­plemental draft for a week. 
Carter was unavailable for comment after the announce­ment. 
The news conference was called after Carter held a workout Thursday. The St. Louis Cardinals were the only NFL team to have a represen­tative attend the workout and Carter said then he didn't know what to expect in the supple­mental draft. 

Carter was declared in­eligible for his senior year after taking money from agents Norby Walters and Lloyd Bloom. The NFL scheduled the supplemental draft at the peti­tion of Carter that he be given the chance to be picked by an NFL team. At least 12 teams had announced they would not participate in the draft. 
The NFL said in a statement that the draft would be delayed to give the NCAA a chance to reinstate Carter and Gladman, who has never acknowledged any dealings with agents. The announcement of the delay fol­lowed a meeting between NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle and a group of athletic direc­tors, including Ohio State Ath­letic Director Rick Bay. 
"I felt it was going to be a small turnout," Carter said of the 45-minute workout that was conducted at an indoor tennis center in Kokomo, located about 60 miles north of In­dianapolis.

Irish open season vs. Southern Ill. 
By BRIAN O'GARA Sports Writer 
Coming off a record­breaking 1986 season, the Notre Dame volleyball team begins its attack on the team's toug­hest schedule ever on Sunday with a 3:30p.m. match against Southern Illinois in the Auxil­iary Gym of the ACC. 
Last fall the Irish ran up a string of 17 consecutive wins en route to a 33-7 record, and were named the most improved team in the Midwest by the Midwest Volleyball Magazine. All this for a team which started two freshmen, three sophomores and a junior for most of the season. 
That success makes the task at hand seem all the more im­posing. Notre Dame will face four teams which finished in the Top 20 last season (Texas, Nebraska, Illinois and Western Michigan) along with such other national powers as Texas A & M, Purdue, Southern Cal and Kentucky. 
Attempting to rise to this challenge will be a still-young but more experienced squad, anchored by returning starters Mary Kay Waller, Maureen Shea, Zanette Bennett (juniors), Taryn Collins and Kathy Cunningham (sophomores). Senior Kathy Baker will fill the sixth starting spot. 
Waller, a 6-0 junior from Lawrence, Kan., finished the 1986 season sixth in the nation in kill percentage (.395) and nth in blocks per game (1.54). She was also named an honorable mention for the Notre Dame's 1986-87 female Athlete of the Year Award. 
Cunningham, a native of Naperville, Ill., and Bennett, from San Antonio, both gained valuable experience at the U.S. Olympic Festival this summer in Durham, N.C. Cunnin­gham's consistent play kept the team in many games last fall, as did her team-leading 292 digs. Bennett paced the Irish in 1986 with 3.27 kills per game and sparked many rallies with her powerful spikes. 
Shea, a middle blocker from Erlanger, Ky., proved to be Notre Dame's most depend­able performer in 1986, leading the team in games played (129) and finishing second in kills and blocks. Collins, an Oak Park, Ill., native who took over the setter position last fall, returns to that all-important position in 1987. 
Baker, a senior from Foun­tain Valley, Calif., has shown great improvement in recent weeks and will be among the starting six on Sunday after­noon. 
"Kathy Baker has done very well in our practices so far," said Head Coach Art Lambert. "She prepared herself very well all summer and that is paying off now." 
Other returning monogram winners include seniors Gretchen Kraus, Jill Suglich, Kathleen Morin and junior Whitney Shewman. 
This cast of 10 returning players gives Lambert an ex-
