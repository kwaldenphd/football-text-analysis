This year I have discovered what the hal­lowed Notre Dame family is all abQut. When I returned in· August, I got some of the worst news I have ever received in my life. My room­mate for the past year and a half had just undergone surgery for the removal of a brain tumor. 
I was frantic. I really. didn't know how he was. I only knew that he had been in surgery much longer than expected. I didn't know if he would live or die. This person is the closest thing to a brother I have. It was then that I saw the Notre Dame family swing into action. 
My friends were there for me when my room­mate and I needed them. Although only a few had returned from home, we had a small Mass for his recovery. My hall signed a poster for him and sent him cards and letters wishing him a speedy recovery. , 
Happily he dia make a quick recovery, al-· though he had to take a leave of absence from the University for this year. He came out for the Penn State game, and said he'd be back next fall. We were all relieved to see him doing so well after such a serious operation and were happy to know he would be returning. 
Mter this experience, I came to believe that the Notre Dame family was more than just nice talk. The way people rallied together when one of their friends was in need was truly touching. 
Now my old roommate is ready to come back, looking forward to returning to the hall and his friends. 
A few weeks ago, he called and said the Office of Student Residences had sent him a letter saying he was to be treated as an off-campus transfer for the purpose of room picks. 
I said that this was ridiculous and had to be a mistake. He asked me to look into it for him, and I assured him I would. 
I went to my rector, who only had been in that position since the fall and didn't know my roommate. Nevertheless, he has been very sup­portive. He said that the housing situation seemed odd and that my roommate should be able to get a room in the hall after everyone had picked a room. He said he would talk to the Office of Student Residences. 
Just two days ago, the order for picking rooms went up, and my roommate's name was not on the list. 
I asked my rector why, and he told me that my roommate indeed would be treated as an off-campus transfer and would get a room only after all incoming freshmen had received a room. 
Calls to the Office of Student Residences con­firmed this. There is nothing that can be done. I can't even pull him in. 
What this really means is that my roommate not only won't get a room in my hall, but he won't get a room anywhere. 


It's too early to tell how many, but it's safe to say that more than a few incoming freshmen will be living in study lounges when school begins in August. It's happened each of my three years here and is bound to happen a fourth, so few if any transfers will make it on campus. 
I can't believe that my roommate will not get housing. He didn't ask to undergo emergency surgery or to withdraw for a year. Now when he is ready to return, he's told that he'll have to look for housing off-campus. 
What will happen to Kevin Hurley when he makes his long-awaited return? Will he be al­lowed housing? If the Office of Student Residences sticks to its guns, he'll be in the same situation my roommate is in now. 
What I really can't believe is how the Notre Dame family now is turning its back on one of its own. 
In August, the family was there. Now it says sorry, we can't give you housing. This Univer­sity, which prides itself on its Catholicism and compassion, suddenly is showing neither. 
Yes, I've learned a lot about the Notre Dame family this year. I've learned that it's fickle. If this is a family, I'd like to be adopted by some­one else.

Star Wars 
continued from page 1 
energy devices closer to the weapons stage. 
The report played an imme­diate role in congressional debate on President Reagan's request to spend $5.8 billion next year on Star Wars. 
Members  of  a  Senate  Ap­ 
proprations  subcommittee  
raised it in  a  closed session  

Thursday with the head of the SDI office, Air Force Lt. Gen_ James Abrahamson, said one congressional source, who declined to be identified. 
The authors of the report, "many of whom have impor­tant roles in developing those technologies," received classi­fied briefings from Defense De­
partment officials, Patel said. 
Patel's co-chairman on the study group was Harvard Uni­versity physicist Nicolaas Bloembergen, who was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1981 for his work on lasers. A six­member committee that reviewed the report included two others who won Nobels for laser research, Charles Townes of the University of California at Berkeley and Ar­thur Schawlow of Stanford Uni­verisity. 
Their report concluded that the power and quality of even the most promising of the lasers and other prospective di­rected energy weapons needs to be improved at least 100 times before they could be used in an anti-missile defense sys­tem.

A student pornogr~phy magazine at Yale Univ. is causing a stir, even before the first issue is printed. Some officials are upset about a poster advertising a benefit dance for the ptJblication, which graphically depicts men and women engaged in sexual acts. The as-yet-unnamed magazine will include both heterosexual and homosexual informa­tion. 
Monitorswillberequiredforoff-campushousing at Brigham Young Univ. next fall in order to ensure that school standards are being upheld. They'll also serve as liaisons between students and BYU in sol­ving housing problems. If the housing is not BYU­approved, the school will "let parents know it's wide-open and that things can get pretty wild," says one official. 
While toilet paper use by dorm residents at Oklahoma Univ. is excessive (78,000 plus rolls last year), at Iowa State Univ. students don't want to use any of it. ISU students, after circulating a pe­tition complaining about tissue paper quality, tested 18 different brands and chose their top five picks. Then, ISU officials selected which brand fit into the school's budget. 
.A~ Auburn Univ. fraternity was officially dismissed from the campus Greek system, a "first" in the school's history. Phi Delta Theta, a part of the Auburn's campus since 1876, was dismissed be­cause of "a long, cloudy history of poor behavior" capped by two recent, serious alcohol-related inci­dents. 
No sex is the rule for Catawba College (N.C.) athletes, who must sign an agreement stating they won't engage in inappropriate h''eterosexual or homosexual activity. They must also agree to at­tend study hall and not to use illegal drugs. Failure to follow the agreement may result in dismissal from the team and notification of an athlete's par­
ents. 

National Orgasm Week was declared recently. An~ to celebrate, Roger Libby, a free­lance sexologist and former Univ. of Massachusetts pro~essor,. urged ~tudents to stage a fantasy ball durmg which they d dress up as their favorite fan­tasy. No word yet on what costume Libby wore.

Blind competition blurs communistic· vision 
For the first half of last century, when technology had not reached its present superiority, society was far from producing enough supplies to keep all of its members from hunger and cold. A great idealist in Europe Karl Marx distinguished between two kinds of people -the proletarians and the bour­geoisies. The proletarians, as Marx saw, though working all day long, did not receive enough pay to support their family. On the other hand, the bour­geoisises, who hired workers to work for them in their factories, enjoyed all the luxuries without working. Marx decided that it was the insatiable desire of bourgeoisises for money that was driving the proletarians, the majority of people, into miserable situation. Out of humanitarian concern, Marx hoped to achieve social justice by the public ownership of the means of production. The ideal has been in practice for more than half a century and remains an op­tion for people in places like Nicaragua and the Phillipines.

guest column 
The main advantages of a so-called communist society, according to its own propagandists, are as follows: so­cial property is ensured since everyone has to work; individual creativity is en­hanced since each individual is one of the hosts of the country and works for himself and the entire society instead of his boss; blind competition between the companies, and hence periodic crisis of overproduction, is avoided since the public ownership allows the government to arrange the entire social production in harmony; social equality is achieved since the party official and government administrators, all devoted people, are public servants rather than rulers; social democracy is guaranteed since the proletarian gov­ernment, which represents the desire of the majority, exercises dictatorship over bourgeoisies and all other parasitic which are seen to inhibit the democratic process. 
A heavenly dream, which turned out to be a nightmare, a nightmare in Rus­sia, China, and many other places. 
The hidden assumption of com­munism is the universal selflessness. If this assumption were valid, com­munism surely would have succeeded nightmare followed. Now and then, these people would learn how to con­tribute less to and take more from the "big communist family." They would learn how to use power, whenever available, for their own interests. And finally, they would learn how to grab power. The idealistic morality is soon totally ruined. The public ownership of the means of production only makes the centralization of power possible, the control over individuals possible, and hence the hierarchy, the dictatorship possible. Classes and the disparity be­tween poverty and richness are far from being ruled out. While old bour­geoisies disappeared, new aristocrats arise among government administra­tors and party officials. 
in  replacing  the  capitalist  system.  
However,  once  this  proved  untrue,  
Doonesbury  

That's exactly what has been happen­ing in every communist country. People in those countries, especially young generations, cannot help ques­tioning the communist doctrines from end to beginning. 
Does the majority always agree on every issue? Certainly not. A govern­ment is always necessary to do what the majority agrees on and to decide what to do when consistency is not found within the majority. This dictat­ing government may represent the majority to some extent at the begin­ning. But what guarantees that it will remain so? It may easily find an excuse to apply dictatorship to every member in the society. And finally, the majority dictatorship over the minority may well become the minority dictatorship over the majority. The majority government is not identical to the majority itself and hence would eventually be alienated from the majority. Unfortun­ately, so far no communist government has escaped such alienation. The moderate communists in the western Europe are still dreaming of the achievement they accuse their commu­nist brother in Russia and China of betraying an authentic proletarian government. As a matter of fact, there is no such thing as majority democracy. When democracy is denied to one person, it is denied to all. 
The reinforcement of absolute un­animity has necessitated a totalitarian government in every communist country. As a result, people become vulnerable victims. There is no right of election since a government centered on certain ideology has to be formed by hierarchy. There is no free press since every newspaper has to speak with one voice in keeping with that ideology.

What originates the responsiblity of government of personnel if it is none of their own business? Success in admin­istration is not necessarily a criterion for promotion since ordinary people don't have a say on that issue. 
What difference does it make if you may claim that you own the state bank yet cannot .take a penny home? Only people with power have access to money there. Of course when the situa­tion deteriorates to reveal the hypocrisy in communism, there is crisis, in which power is transferred to a group perceived as less corrupt. These kind of crises occur periodically, almost predictably (every ten years in China). 
What motivates people to work hard it they don't get fired anyway? What motivates a factory to improve its pro­duction if bankruptcy never occurs? Communism does not allow unemploy­ment and bankruptcy, which it claims to belong to decaying capitalism only. When a factory is losing money, all the money in the state bank is poured out to compensate it. Public ownership of communism actually generates equalitarianism which rules out com­petition. 
The naivete of communist fantasy is that it tried to achieve social justice by elimination of competition. Of course, it did succeed in eliminating competi­tion in economy, and hence eliminating development. Instead, another broad field was opened for competition, com­petition in politics, which brought not development, but catastrophe. 
Since life began on our planet, there has been competition. It should not be surprising that egoism dominates the behavior of animal individual. Life as as whole evolutes through competition according to the rule of natural selec­tion. However, human individual com­petes not only for its physical existence in society, but also for its spiritual exis­tence in culture. In this world of still very limited material abundance, the drive for material wealth rather than spiritual accomplishment is dominat­ing human behavior. Competition still bears egoist mark and is far from be­coming purely spiritual. One funda­mental of communist morality is to live for others' happiness. Unfortunately, it never worked. 
If communism is nightmarish, how has it come to be accepted in some na­tions? Marx was not evil, nor is Mar­xism. Actually, when communism came to power in China, it was hailed as salvation by the majority with some-

thing approaching religious zealotry. Marxism resembles the church in its attitude towards poor people. In some sense, Marxism is an image of Christi­anity in politics, though a distorted one. This may help to explain why churches in poor countries are often accused of communist sympathy simply becasue they help poor people. 
Competition promotes evolution, but, only at the cost of sacrificing the weak competitors. Competition is indeed gen­erally a constructive force, but it is blind, just like wind, flood, or any other natural forces. The process of natural selection is somehow painful. As a fan­tastic counteraction to ·the natural forces, religion has always been a part of the human dream of liberating itself from nature. Man has dreamed of transcending flood and earthquake, plague and death, and now competition. Communism represents an attempt and a failure to realize the dream in modern society. 
A contradiction about constructive competition is that it is self-destructive. The result of competition is the further differentiation between the strong com­petitors. This destroys the basis for a fair competition. The effect is espe­cially deteriorating when both social privilege and social disadvantage are bequeathed to future generations. That is how hatred and despair find their roots in the minds of children from poor families. When the polarization sur­passes human tolerance, a capitalist so­ciety may hearken to communist ap­peal. 
No doubt there should be some limita­tion to prevent differentiation from be­coming so huge. That is why each so­ciety needs a government and law. The question is where, how and to what ex­tent should the limits be set. The socialization of capitalism in northern Europe and the capitalization of com­munism in Russia, and in China a few months ago indicate that both capitalism and communism have got to learn something from each other. Where elimination of one of them or reconciliation will be the result is un­known. While competition is definitely necessary for evolution, we should also 
consider  that  natural  selection  
produces serpents  as  well  as  human  
beings.  

Nile Huo (pseudonym) was once a member of Red Guard (not to be con­fused with any international terrorist organization) during China's Cultural Revolution.

Campus Quote 
"The trouble with pre-marital sex is its power to impair this freedom of choice. At the very time a couple need the clearest view of one an­other and must be free enough from each other to decide whether to embrace each other for life, they are held in an embrace which makes them feel as though they have already done so, and so their energy to face the life decision is weakened.''

A 
n Tostal Is Notre Dame's answer to the "nothing-to-do-In-South-Bend" syndrome. The favorite pastime of many Notre Dame students Is com­plaining. "But there's so much to com­plain about." you say. There's the alco­
hol policy, the lopsided male-female ratio and South Bend. 
Notre Dame has long suffered through an Identity crisis In the party area. "I thought Notre Dame was a "dry" campus," a friend asked. "Well," I told her the whole story of the exodus 
off-campus. I started with the campus VIew party cruises, continued through Bridget's, 
and ended with the South Bend cops. "What about the bars?" she asked. "This Is Indiana. You need an ID, a really good ID," I tried to explain. "I think you should transfer to Univer­sity Of Illinois, "she told me. 
Trying to defend the reputation of the Golden Dome, I told her about some of the better weekends I had here. "You mean the cops actually send the dogs on students," she gasped. Dramatically, I told the story of Notre Dame students who were brutally breathalyzed and 
harrassed while trying to er\Joy a party. An Tostal Is Notre Dame's chance to party. OK. so It Is non-alcoholic. But 
Notre Dame Is Infamous for Its at­tempts to throw non-alcoholic parties. We did have the world's largest musical chairs competition, and then there Is 
Theodore's. An Tostal hasn't yet attracted the masses that nock to Indiana University 
for the Little 500, or to the University of Wisconsin for Halloween. But those are state schools. They are supposed to be party schools. Besides, Wisconsin has a grandfather clause In Its drinking law that makes many of us under 2 1-year­olds legal there. And Indiana University gets .3000 kegs for their Little 500 
weekend. 
I asked some students how they thought An Tostal could be built up Into a bigger, more famous event like those of the state schools. "Alcohol would make the event better," was the most popular response. "Couldn't they 
bend the rules just a little, like at SYR's or tallgaters?" they asked me. But we all know that we can have a good time without alcohol, I assured 
them. "At this school," said Doug Reil­ly, "If there Is alcohol, people get more relaxed." I reminded him of the alcohol policy and told him that I knew the University wouldn't go for the Idea. "The people who are going to drink are going to drink regardless of the alcohol policy. It would be safer to drink on campus," said Reilly. As with any dis­cussion about the alcohol policy, we 
came to no peaceful resolution. 
"I think An Tostal would be more successful if the faculty gave no papers or exams during An Tostal," Steve Rawlings suggested. Keep dreaming, I thought. It wouldn't be Notre Dame without all of the work. Rob Walters suggested that the An Tostal committee should send out questionnaires polling the students about what events they would like to have. "They should pump up the popular events like Bookstore Basketball and the mudplts more, to 
make them a bigger tradition," Walters continued.

get annoying at times. Second­ly, this album has eight songs on it which have been released on other albums already in dif­ferent versions. The new ver­sions here are often disap­pointing. especially the re-working of the once haunt­ing "Back To The Old House." 
On the bright side, Johnny Marr's innovative beautiful guitar work continues brilliantly and most of the new songs here are really great. Their as­tounding musical range is really shown off well here, from the quasi-hardcore "London" to the lullaby-esque "Asleep." 
Louder Than Bombs is a good Smiths album to get if you've heard about them but don't have any of their albums. Don't expect themes. This is a singles album. Whether the Smiths become the Rolling Stones of the Eighties is anyone's guess, but most of the music on this album proves them to be an important. inter­esting. and innovative band.

A 
common rock critic com­plaint is that there aren't enough exciting and adven­turous bands around these days. They hearken back to the 1960s as a time when bands like the Beatles and the Rolling Stones (inarguably the biggest and best bands of that time or any time) were daring and commercial at the same time. A sort of glow emanates from these bands because they began at a time when rock criticism itself was in its in­fancy.

~ \\ The Smiths ~ \Louder than bombs 
As critics and fans alike grew more jaded and discriminating. the idea l,r the rock star changed aud so did the music. Inexplicably, before anyone knew ll most rock music was dull, populist trash. Im­mediacy, energy. and inspira­tion had fallen by the wayside to danceabllity, showmanship, and technical competency. This was what plagued the 1970s. 
Punk re-established rock and roll as the domain of the young. the energetic, and the slightly insane. Disregarding the current. disturbing trend of metronomic, syncopated, coldly programmed synth­music junk. the crop of what rock history will regard as the important Eighties bands (not Boston, not Bon Jovi, and not Genesis) owe their start to punk. 
Louder Than Bombs, a sort of double album retrospective of the band's history thus far, is the Smiths' latest offering to the American record-buying public. It can't really be called a "new" album, because it only boasts six "new" tracks, making the majority of the songs here "old." This market­ing ploy is a little too cute for my tastes, since this double album's new songs insure that old fans will buy it. while its Greatest Hits nature insures that new fans will be attracted, 
too. 
Most of the music here represents an interesting evolu­tion of the musical punk ethic. Smiths songs can be divided roughly into two categories and this album, patchwork though it is, is no different. 
The first grouping are the ambiguous, confusing love songs, like the great new "Is It Really So Strange?" and "Ask." Many times these "love" songs are deceptively violent lyrically. The speaker in "Is It Really So Strange?" tells his lover: "Oh yes, you can kick meland you can punch moond you can break my face-but you won't change the way I feeVCause I love you ... " This is not a tradi­tional lov.e song. 
The other category of Smiths'songs --political and social comment songs --are not as prevalent here as they are on other albums. "This Night Has Opened My Eyes" is an especially moving song against either abortion or maybe what would happen if there were no abortions. 
This is what I meant about the furthering of the punk idea of turning pop music on its ear. Like so many "enigmatic" Eighties Bands (REM, Let's Ac­tive), the Smiths tend to throw out a certain feeling through the various images they write into their songs. 
I have only two complaints regarding Louder Than Bombs. First. a general complaint that I have with some of the Smiths' songs is that Morrissey is sometimes a little too verbose and wandering in his lyrics, and his tra-la-la yodeling vocals

Timbuk 3: a dynamic duo 
DENNIS CORRIGAN reatures writer 
T 
imbuk .3 isn't your average group. When they play out­doors at Stepan Saturday, you'll only see two people: the husband and wife duo of Pat MacDonald and Barbara K. So why the Tlmbuk .3? 
Besides the fact that Barbara says three is the group's lucky number, the third member of the group, T.3, Is a jambox which plays prerecorded bass and drum machines to the duo's onstage guitar playing. It's an unusual mix. but then Tlmbuk .3 Is an unusual group. 
The group hit It big with their debut album, Greetings From Tlmbuk .3, which featured a mule carrying a television on the jacket cover. Their debut single, "The Future's So Bright. I Gotta Wear Shades," went Top 20. In addition, the album was one of the most original of the year, mixing a variety of rock. country, folk. blues and reggae. 
Pat and Barbara originally met in Madison, Wis., but moved to Austin, Tex., and a club called the Hole In The Wall. After an appearance on MTV's "The Cutting Edge," 
I.R.S. signed the group to a record contract, and the group put on Its shades. 
In a recent phone conversa­tion with Barbara, she talked about the group's recent European tour, philosophy and more. 
How were you received everywhere? 
It went really well. I was surprised. We were real popular in r:ngland at least and some other countries are starting to catch on to our music too, which is kind of interesting to me (laughs). 
Are you really surprised by the success you've had? 
Sure, I mean it's kind of rare that bands put out their first

record and have so much suc­
cess. Although, there are lots 
of bands. There's a whole new 
crop of bands --really good 
bands--that are getting airplay 
on the radio. It was a good 
year for new bands. 
Other bands out of Austin? 
There are a lot of bands that are doing well In Austin. Maybe more regionally that are real successful or in a few regions of the country. There aren't that many that have good record deals where they go to record companies promoting albums. Although the T-Birds are certainly an exception. They're doing great. 
What do you think It Is about Austin that there are so many bands coming from there? 
We're a supporter of original rock and roll. It's just the com­munity. There are so many clubs to play and lots of bands. It's a vibrant music scene with all different styles. There are a couple blues clubs, rock clubs, and big clubs that can have touring bands and also help out the local acts. It's really good. 
And then there's The Hole In The Wall. 
And then there's The Hole In The Wall (laughs). 
Were they happy to see you back? 
Oh, yeah. We played there under an alias right before we went to Europe and had a great gig. We haven't played there since we've been back. As a matter of fact. I was there last night. 
You have so many different styles of music on your album. What types of music were most Influential on you? 
Oh, all different kinds. Pat listened to the radio, and I was more Influenced or actually Inspired by live music because I grew up mostly In Texas

where there's a lot outdoors all 
year round. I know that Pat 
used sneak his radio under the 
covers at night when he was a 
kid and turn It up only loud 
enough so that he could hear. 
I read a quote In Rolling Stone where Pat said that the "universe vibrates to a 8o Dlddley beat." What Is that? Is he a big 8o Dlddley fan? 
I think he's a fan of the Bo Dlddley beat or what has been coined the Bo Dlddley beat. We like the music of Bo Dlddley. I think his politics are a little questionable, though. 
What Is. the Tlmbuk .3 vtew of 
the world? 
That's a big question, you know. It's changing every day. Just going through Europe, through all these different countries, and experiencing different viewpoints on this and that -how they feel about us good old USA Americans over here. Nothing really hard and fast, just a kind of a feel for different things. It's pretty interesting. but it's always changing too. 
Will the European tour have 
any Influence on your next 
album? 
I guess everything that we 
experience somehow sees its 
way Into what we create and 
what we do. 
Where did you get the Idea for 
the mule on the cover of the 
record? 
I saw a picture In National Geographic when we were recording. It was a picture of a mule transporting a television through the narrow streets of a Moroccan village. We'd been thinking about using a televi­sion somewhere on the cover because some of our songs deai with TV and the media. I 
just thought It was a good 
Image. When I saw this with a 
donkey I thought It was really 
comical. Originally, when we 
tried to get the actual photo­
graph, we could never talk to 
the photographer, just his 
agency. They wanted to charge 
$10,000 or something to use 
the photograph and that was 
more than we spent even 
recording the record. So we

AN 

TOSTAL 
Sights 
of Spring 
continued from page I 
Even though An Tostal hasn't yet attracted the wandering road-trippers of the Midwest, It is still good party. Where else could you find the world's largest basketball tournament, featuring 662 teams, with the most creative team names (at least they used to be creative). The finals of the bookstore tournament end the An Tostal events on Serene Sunday at 
1:00 p.m. at Stepan Courts. The final two women's teams and the final two men's teams will battle it out for the XVI title. 
Frivolous Friday should be 
called "Fat Friday" since many 
of the events center arond 
food. There are contests for 
licorice eating, hot pepper 
eating, donut eating, pie 
eating, cereal eating, and pop­
corn eating, to name a few. 
The An Tostal committee was 
clever in recognizing Notre 
Dame's love of free food. All of 
the food events take place in 
front of Alumni and Cushing 
beginning at 12:30 and lasting 
until 2:45. 
Friday's events also include a 
keg toss. Yes, the kegs are 
empty. But, who empties 
them? Someone told me that 
they shipped them up from IU. 
A mattress race, cow chip 
throwing contest, car stuffing 
contest, impersonations, loud­
mouth, and a serf auction are 
some of the other afternoon 
events on the South Quad. 
Sunny Saturday is also 
known as Muddy Saturday. 
Many consider the mudpits to 
be the highlight of An Tostal. 
People like playing in the mud, 
throwing mud, and most im­
portantly, throwing other 
people in the mud. This year's 
mud events include a chariot 
race, wheelbarrow races, pillow 
fights, volleyball, and tug-of­
war. The formal mud events 
begin at I :00 p.m.. The free­
for-all lasts as long as anyone 
can stand it. The mudplts are 
the ideal way to get back at 
those who threw you In the 
mud last year. The mudplts are 
also an Ideal way to let out all 
the frustration of the semester 
before finals. And they say 
Notre Dame is a dry campus. 
Saturday's events do Include 
a lot more than the mud. 
There are the hangover 5K and 
!OK at 9:.30 a.m. at Stepan Center. Satrday morning and early afternoon is filled with picnic events, including a three-legged race, a sack race, and a balloon toss. And Satur­day night there's recess. Is that Notre Dame's answer to the 
alcohol policy? Recess lasts 
from 8:30-1 1 at Stepan Center. 
The highlight of Saturday 
evening's events is the Timbuk 
3 concert. Timbuk 3 is one of 
the hottest bands to invade 
Notre Dame in a long while. 
The concert is outdoors at at 
Stepan Courts at 10 p.m.. And 
the event is free. 
So there you have it, An 
Tostal, the Notre Dame tradi­
tion. If this year's events are 
successful, maybe the word will 
get out. Maybe next year Notre 
Dame will get 3000 kegs for An

What was once round of 662 has been narrowed to Elite Eight 
By PETE SKIKO 
and BRIAN O'GARA 
Sports Writers 
Eight teams. Seven games. One champion. The laws of the game of basketball tell us that any one of the eight remaining squads are capable of walking away from Stepan I as the newly­crowned Bookstore champion. 
But only five players will sur­vive the rigors of the next three days, and experience the glory and adulation befitting the win­ners of the month-long tourna­ment. Each remaining team has endured a long and grueling road, paved with Midgets, Druids, Fags, Team No. (take your pick). and Dead Chicks; as well as pouring rains, driving blizzards and biting winds. 
Today's games will be played on the Bookstore Courts this af­ternoon at 5 and 6, while the semifinals and finals will be played at Stepan. Here Is a quick rundown of the final eight teams: 
Party At Chips When We Repeat -The defending cham­pions have quietly become the team to beat In the tournament. Known last year as Lee's BBQ Roundhouse, Party at Chips returns four players and adds Rick DIBernardo to replace last year's Bookstore MVP, Jim Dolan. They have run teams Into the ground for the past three weeks with their height and quickness, scoring most of their points In the transition game. Bubba Cunningham, who also played for 1984 champion Macri's Dell, runs the show from the point for the favorites, while Steve Beuerleln adds outside scoring punch. DIBernardo, a member of the 1985 champion Fun Bunch, bangs the boards for Party at Chips along with Mike Kovaleski and Tom Antonini. 
Tequila White Lightning  A team that has been to the final 16 of this tournament for five consecutive years has to be highly regarded, and Tequila White Lightning certainly Is. Floor captain Lou Nanni, himself a former Mr. Bookstore, has once again molded this squad Into a cohesive unit that's hallmarks have been consistency and level­headed play. Nanni has quite a corps to feed the ball to this year, as Matt Dlngens has given Te­quila the big man that may have been the missing link In their previous Bookstore bids. The rebounding and Inside scoring of Dlngens and Sean Cullinan have added a new dimension to a squad that Is already one of the best passing teams In the bunch. Mike Scotty returns from last year's team to bring even more experience to the well-rounded unit. Brian Koehr, who led Te­quila with six points In the round of 16 on Wednesday, fills the fifth spot. 
Da' Brothers of Manhood ­Quick and exciting play has led Manhood through six victories and could take them to the finals. Joel Williams and Tim Brown return from lastyear's Much More Manhood, which made the Final Four before bowing to Lee's BBQ. Brown may be the key In­gredient for Manhood, running the fast break as If the court had yard markers. Williams teams with Donald Royal to give Man­hood the muscle and height un­derneath, while Kim Adams and Wes Shorter add outside scoring punch and quick hands on defense. Da' Brothers benefit from Brown's decision to stay on campus for the Blue-Gold game rather than head to the Drake Relays for the track team. 
New Order -This quintet from Grace Hall Is one of three un­ranked teams remaining In the tournament. They have dis­played hot outside shooting In recent games and play well to­gether as a team. Joe Hills has paced New Order with his quick­ness and shooting touch, while Tim Crawford and Ralph Ferrara both can fill up the basket from the outside. Ferrara tallied nine points In Wednesday's 21-18 come-from-behind win over 4 Fags and a Zahmble. Ray Blajda and Chris Jenks are the big men In the paint. while Hllls and Craw­ford have the height to bang the boards as well. 
Leone's Stallions -Last year's runner-up has run Its way to the final eight. holding Its opponents to under I 0 points In most games, Including a 21-8 drub­bing of Put It In The Hole, Chief, on Wednesday. AI Martin runs the break for Leone's, dumping off to teammates Mike O'Grady, 
---1987 SUMMER 
Gary Sasse, Blll Sullivan and John Leone. O'Grady's height and shooting touch Is comple­mented by crafty boardwork. while Sullivan and Sasse can go on scoring binges at any time. Leone replaces talented John Mundo from last year's runner­up. 
Who's Next.Who Cares? -An unheralded fivesome from St. Ed's, the apparently apathetic Who's Next certainly doesn't play like a team which doesn't scout and prepare for upcoming foes. Joel Rump has had the hot hand lately, scoring seven and nine points, respectively, In his squad's wins In the rounds of.32 and 16. Mike DIPaolo is the floor general for Who's Next. wielding a deadly shooting touch and dis­hing out pinpoint passes to teammates Mike Nelligan, Greg Noe and Brian Brohman. This team lacks dominating height and relies on quickness. 
Corporate Raiders  Corporate Raiders has become the dark horse of the remaining teams, with help from a rather vociferous fan club. Fan support won't beat Da' Brothers of Man­hood, but great efforts from already-hot Pat Walsh at the point. John Buscher (and last year's nine-foot slam dunk king) at shooting guard, and Cedric Figaro Inside just might. The Raiders also need the defensive play of center Jeff Stump to remain consistent as the squad heads into the tourney's last leg. Outside shooting and a smooth transition game have carried the Raiders thus far. 
4 Slamma Jamma  Team play and the recent emergence of Scott H leks as a dominating pres­ence has been the driving force behind 4 Slamma Jamma's suc­cess. Hicks nailed 11 points In the squad's nip-and-tuck 24-22 victory over SOMFAW on Wednes­day, but when and If Hicks fal­ters, he has more than simply bit players to back him up. Ray Flan­nery and John Wassll have pro­vided scoring punch, and Chris Perozek. a first-team All· Bookstore selection last year, hopes to find some more of his old form late in the tournament. Tom Schuster Is a role player who wlll shoot when open, but otherwise wlll crash the boards.

Women's Bookstore field down to eight 
By THERESA KELLY 
Sports Writer 
The Women's Bookstore Tournament Is down to Its Elite Eight. Here's a brief look at the remaining teams: We Weren't Cheerleaders In ·High School  After squeezing out a 21-19 vic­tory over We'll do Anything For A Quarter In the round of 16, Cheerleaders hopes Its balanced scoring will continue. 
"We have fun, but we work hard, too," said Kathleen McDavid. "We run a three-guard offense, but depending on the other team's strengths, we can go to the middle well, too." 
Double Decker Oreo Cookie  No doubt about It, this Is a tough team. Last year's champ, the Cookie looks to the scoring of Lavetta Willis and team quick­ness to demolish Its opponents. "I think our chances are really good If we keep playing the way we are," said Cookie player Zanette Bennett. "We are deter· mined to keep our title." The Cookie's defense has prevailed so far, having given up only two points in Its first two games. 
Iceman, Slider, Maverick. Goose  How About a Game of Hoops? · The team with the longest name, the members have played well throughout the tournament behind the scoring of Francine Kelly and Colleen O'Connor.

have good overall players and a lot of balance," said Annmarle Reilly. "The competition this year Is really tough, but we just need to play well to win." 
Hoosier Lawyer???  A team made up entirely oflaw students, the Lawyer has breezed through the tournament on the strength of basketball experience and teamwork. They had little trouble with Who Needs High Heels, Anyway? In their last matchup, winning. 21-14. A tournament fa· vorlte, the Lawyer should con· tinue to play well. 
fast Break five  Er\Joylng a great height advantage over most of the other Bookstore teams, the Five hopes that Inside play and rebounding are enough to carry them to the finals. "The competition looks really good," said one of the Five, Cynthia Gucklen. "We have good bal· ance, though. Everyone contrl· butes." Will that be enough? Only time will tell for the Five. 
Kukla, fran, Ollie, and 2 Other Players· Another team that relies on balance, Kukla has added quickness and endurance to get to the Elite Eight. "We play well as a team," said Tina Duffy. "We have a great combination of out­side shooters and Inside play." 
Quixotic Quint  A really tough team, the Quint looks to wrap up four great years of Bookstore play with a championship. "We are better this year with our new player (Kathy Brommeland)," said Regie Richter. "Kathy's awesome at center. The compe­tition Is good, but our height will help." The Quint, another team with balanced scoring. hopes to keep up their outstanding play and make this a tournament to remember.

Of bigots, Bakker & peacemaker King 
W 
hat I chiefly hate about this very cruel century is its unwillingness to tolerate heroes. Martin Luther King was a very great hero who kept tel­ling us, "I have a dream." It was a powerful dream, for which he was willing to put his life on the line. It was a dream which inspired other Americans, whose families had been badly used for many generations, to start dreams of their own. King's dream of black children and white children growing up peacefully together as brothers and sisters was so good that it seemed like one of the mes­sianic messages given to the Old Testament prophets. 
Father Robert Griffin 
Letters to a Lonely God 
When King stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial to describe his dream in a speech, the streets in Washing­ton were jammed with crowds of his followers, black and white together, anxious to lis­ten to him as the new Moses delivering the slaves from bondage. He had a dream In living color which defined him as a patriot. He understood the abstract language in the official documents guaranteeing Americans their right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of hap­piness. 
King's bitter enemies were not the politicians defending segregation as part of the Southern way of life. His real enemies are the detractors who now try to keep our minds off his dream by their insistence on our looking down at his al­leged feet of clay. He died for his country's sins in the way that soldiers die in a war. Bigots, fearing the image of him as a black Christ spread the stories dishonoring him as God's servant. They tried to disqualify him as a civil rights 
leader with an immaculate dream of children unbothered by prejudice. 
A story out of the Talmud says that at the creation, the Master of the Universe decided that living things should begin as seeds which keep getting bigger and bigger. Only sorrow was created fully-grown. People were created to decrease the size of the sorrows in the world. 
The devil continually tries to blind us to human goodness. "The evil that men do lives after them," Shakespeare wrote, "The good is often in­terred with their bones." 'There is always something." said 

Willie Stark. the politician out of the Louisiana statehouse In "All The King's Men." "From the stink of the diaper to the stench of the shroud, there is always something you can use as blackmail." That's a fairly Presbyterian outlook. about which Oral Roberts tells us not to worry, since sinners in need of hanging are saved by faith and not works. 
John Kennedy wasn't a saint. He wasn't even a martyr in the same sense King was. Still, Kennedy left us proud of being Americans, and the country has been going downhill ever since he died. Could we not give him credit for the size of his dreams as he showed them to us on his inauguration day or at the Berlin Wall? How many more books will be written to demythologize Camelot? 
We've become a nation of cynics anxious to find out the worst about people so that we can write them off as phonies. The Boston Irish who kept voting James Michael Curley for mayor were realists; they understood that human gran­deur is always flawed. 
Curley was a lovable rogue operating on the principle that you can't make an omelette without breaking eggs. Meeting a poor, homely widow, Curley would slip her some change. "Every woman needs money and good looks," he would tell her, "and now you have both." Such a compliment covers a multitude of sins. He was adored in South Boston as an Irishman who grew up poor and never forgot to take care of his own. 
Even though he spent part of his time in office as a jailbird, the voters whom he was good to didn't mind. They felt that he loved them, and that he would help the working man or his bereaved family when times were hardest. He would chase away the sorrow waiting at the door like a wolf. A month after Curley's death, Archbishop Cus­hing received the Cardinal's red hat for which he had been waiting for years. The Irish said, "James Michael got the Cardinal his promotion." 
Even if the courts declared James Michael a crook. the Irish knew that all was well with his soul. He was like the Good Thief who was told on his deathbed, "You will be with me in Paradise." 
Now, all the lovable rougues who used to rule the cities are dead. Edwin O'Connor wrote their obituary in "The Last Hur­rah." We will not see them elected to pubic office again. 
You have to worry about a man who doesn't have a dream, or who doesn't trust that other people have a dream that they live by. How could the television preachers have turned on Jim Bakker If they believed he was sincere as a shepherd of souls who brought the black sheep home? '"He's a cancer on the body of the Church," declared Jimmy Swaggart throwing the poor, soiled shepherd to the wolves because of a five-year-old sin. 

The electronic church has no sacrament of reconciliation available to the sinner needing to make his confession and receive absolution. There is no seal of confession; one preac­her discusses another preac­her's frailty on a talk show beamed coast to coast. There are no reserves of grace whi~h heal the soul and fill it with peace. Even the shrink felt free to describe Bakker rolling on the floor out of shame and self-hatred. 
Everything that happened was show business staged in a glass house, as simple enter­tainment. Such a religion has no grass roots; its pastors are con artists ignorant of what Christianity means by mercy and forgiveness. With them as his judges, Bakker was more sinned against than sinning. 
Once there was a famous teacher on this campus who used to remind his students that the Latin word "credo" doesn't mean "I behave." As the years went on, the teacher, through consistent self-neglect, got sick and slowed down physically. His former brilliance dimmed; he survived as a ghost, too burnt out for fresh insights. During the sad time he was dying. the students kept alive the reputation of his greatness. 
On the day of his funeral, I heard one freshman telling an­other, "He died of a broken heart." I could have con­tradicted him, "He died as an alcoholic," but it somehow seemed better not to. A kind of mythologizin!:i was beginning. and Notre Dame would be en­riched by the myth. 
Sometimes the opposite happens, however. Sometimes mythical figures are belittled for their feet of clay. Giants are forgotten as though they never existed. Their monuments rest in the hearts and minds of young scholars to whom they imparted the lessons of love and truth which decrease the size of the sorrows in the world. Like Martin Luther King. they serve God with their im­maculate dreams. I hope these myths rise from the grave to haunt the campus.

will be the best game out there today. But I'll ruin the surprise and tell you now-the New Or­der has arrived. 
Now I realize Leone's is the most intense team in the tourn­ament, and I know it has a great transition game. And I see how no teams have even come close to beating Leone's. Aye, there's the rub. They have not been tested. New Order has survived a few scares to get to this point and needs to be at its best to beat Leone's. But it will. 
New Order's balanced attack 
and hot shooting are peaking. 
Joe Hills, Tim Crawford and Ralph Ferrara as a backcourt trio provide the firepower, and Ray Blajda is blue-collar-un­derneath. If New Order can shut down the Stallions fast break and continuing shooting well, they're not done yet, baby (I've heard that before). 
Da' Brothers of Manhood may just have the best overall talent among the remaining teams. Corporate Raiders are riding in Cinderella's carriage and have been playing great team ball. But Manhood has been tested, they have just begun to click as a team and Tim Brown is staying in South Bend, so I don't see an upset in this one.

In the Final Four, then, we have Party at Chips against New Order and Tequila White Lightning facing Da' Brothers. 

New Order and Tequila will have to settle for finishing one step away. Party at Chips is just too much for the fivesome from Grace Hall. And Donald Royal will need to assert him­self more than he has, but Man­hood's quickness and the inside play of Royal, Joel Williams and Brown the leaper will over­whelm Tequila.

Oilers down Jets; Leafs stop Wings 
Associated Press 

EDMONTON, Alberta ­Charlie Huddy and Dave Hunter scored late in the first period Thursday night and the Edmonton Oilers went on to a 5-3 victory ovl;!r the Winnipeg Jets to take a two-game lead in the Smythe Division finals. 
The Jets, who have never beaten the Oilers in an NHL playoff game, host Game 3 Sat­urday night. 
The Jets scored first when Dale Hawerchuk stole the puck to the right of Edmonton ~oaltender Grant Fuhr and centered the puck to Thomas Steen, who beat Fuhr with a rising wrist shot at 6:35. 
But Huddy tied the game with his first goal of the playoffs at 16: 18 when his slap­shot from 45 feet went through 

Raiders

rebound with Donald Royal, and if they can stop Tim Brown's quick first step into the paint (two pretty big if's, but the Raiders have the people to do it), they will beat Da' Brothers of Manhood. I expect overtime, and I don't think Da' Brothers can pull off another nailbiter. Raiders by two. 
In the semis, Party at Chips will face its most severe test of the tourney from Leone's Stal­lions, and still win by five or six. Too much height, too much muscle. Just too much. Corpor­ate Raiders could be a team of destiny, but I don't think it will be able to stay with Tequila a tangle of arms and legs and past Winnipeg _ goaltender Pokey Reddick. 
Hunter made it 2-1 at 18:30, rebounding Steve Smith's slap­shot past Reddick. 
Maple Leafs 7, Red Wings 2 
DETROIT-Toronto got first­period goals from Steve Thomas, Rick -Vaive and Dan Daoust as the Maple Leafs beat the Detroit Red Wings 7-2 Thursday night to take a two­game lead in their best-of­seven Norris Division finals. 
The Maple Leafs, who won only 10 NHL games on the road all season, now have won four of five away from home during the Stanley Cup playoffs. The series resumes Saturday night in Toronto. 
White Lightning late. I thnm this will be one of the best matchups of the to'Urney, with both squads virtually even on the boards and in team speed, but Tequila's desire to win the big one will be the deciding fac­tor. Tequila, 21-18. 
The final probably will be billed by the commissioners as the tourney's dream matchup, and there will be the pre-game hype, the throngs of students pulling for the underdogs and the drama building after the All-Star Game. Stay home and study, folks -you can mail this one in. Tequila White Lightning will be down early and stay down. But it shouldn't despair. No one could have prevented Sunday night's bash at Chips. 
At l~ast I hope not, or I'll hear about it for an awful long time .

This leaves us with the Final Four, the dream come true for the women involved. In the first game, Double Decker Oreo Cookie will win. This team is loaded with outstanding players, and Iceman, despite its talent, will bow out in this round. 
Although Hoosier Lawyer??? has made a great case for itself, we're going to pick (with some hesitancy) the Quixotic Quint. Currently on a roll, the Quint only gave up five points in its Sweet 16 game. Again, the size advantage will tell the story. 
So in the final, it's Double Decker Oreo Cookie taking on the Quixotic Quint, a worthwhile championship matchup if there ever was one. This is finally going to be the year for the Quint, who will dethrone the 1986 champion and take the crown. The Quint can't lose, its history makes the outcome clear. As freshmen, the players got to the Elite Eight, as sophomores, they fell in the Final Four, and last year, they lost in the champi­onship game. Although the Cookie will be ready for the rematch, this is the year the Quixotic Quint will earn the coveted women's title.

Irish baseball tea01 loses, 6-5, to Butler's late surge 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Sports Writer 
For six innings Thursday at Jake Kline Field, the Notre Dame baseball team appeared to be breezing toward its fourth consecutive victory. 
But in the final three innings, the Irish fell into the same bad habits that caused them to lose eight straight games earlier, and Butler came from behind to beat a sloppy Notre Dame team, 6-5. 
"I really thought if we could win today, playing a struggling St. Louis team this weekend, we might be able to get some wins together," said Head Coach Larry Gallo. "I told them they had to be ready from the beginning of the game. We have to make some hard and fast decisions in the next week and a half." 
Butler scored first when junior first baseman Jeff Cun­nington, who haunted the Irish throughout the game, blasted a solo home run far past the left­field wall against Irish starter Robert Fitz. It was the only trouble Fitz ran into in his four innings of work. 
Notre Dame made sure the lead did not last long, as a run­scoring single by Mike Moshier and an RBI double by Pat Pesavento put the Irish in front, 2-1, in the second inning. 
Notre Dame scored twice more in the fourth inning and, after another RBI by Butler's Cunnington cut the lead to 4-2, the Irish grabbed another run in the fifth inning to take a 5-2 lead. 
The Irish had several chances to break the game open, but Notre Dame left nine runners on base in the first five innings to keep the game close. 
The Irish would later regret the missed opportunities. 
After Fitz' four innings, Tom Howard came on for the Irish, allowing one run in two innings of relief. In the seventh inning, the Notre Dame pitching did· not fare quite as well. Erik Madsen opened the inning on the mound and, after giving up an RBI single to Cunnington and loading the bases, gave way to John Gleeson. Gleeson retired his first batter for the second out of the inning, but then walked in two runs to tie the score at five. Brian Piotrowicz became the third Irish pitcher of the inning, and got out of the inning, but by then Butler had tied the game. 
Meanwhile, after the Irish had more or less had their way with Butler starter Rick Ghar­rett, they were being puzzled by Bulldog reliever Tim Mas­heck. Masheck · started the sixth, and he did not give u}:> a run in four innings. 
"They weren't overpowering pitchers," said Gallo. "We swung at pitches that weren't good, and we weren't making adjustments.'' 
Cunnington, who had five hits in five at bats and four RBI, dealt the final blow to the Irish in the eighth inning. Following a two-out double by catcher Brad Phelps, c;unnington got the game-winning RBI by driving in Phelps with a double to the centerfield wall. Cun­nington ended the game with a home run, a double and three singles. 
The Irish could not rally in the final two innings, and Piotrowicz suffered the loss after giving up one run in two­and-a-third innings. While Notre Dame Jeft 13 runners on base, Gallo pointed at the team's inability to make plays on defense as a prime reason for the loss. 
"It's a simple game, and we're making it really difficult right now," said Gallo. "We had several opportunities to make double plays and didn't do it. There's no way in the world the game should have gone to the point it did." 
Notre Dame will go on the road this weekend for a three­game series with St. Louis, a team that has suffered more than its share of losses. Even though St. Louis held a 4-31 record going into this week, Gallo stressed that another sloppy game could result in a disappointing weekend. 
"St. Louis is kind of strug­gling, but no matter who we play, we're going to be in for a long day if we don't make the plays," said Gallo.

Won1en's Bookstore slices field to eight 
By ANNE GALLAGHER Sports Writer 
While An Tostal activities got underway Thursday, basket­balls were bouncing on the out­door courts of the Angela Ath­letic Facility at Saint Mary's campus. The contests resulted in the selection of the elite eight

teams which will for the championship this weekend. 
"The tournament looks well balanced," -said chairwoman Barbara Tull. 
There were strong perfor­mances by many contenders but only the favored teams came out on top. The closest contest pitted We Weren't Cheerleaders In High School against We'd Do Anything For A Quarter. The Cheerleaders squeaked by the Quarters, 21­19. 
Anne Gallagher has details at right. In other action, The Oyster Crew was frozen solid in its en­deavor against the Icemen. The Crew was held to nine

Special to the Observer 
Matt Kilcullen, a part-time assistant on the Notre Dame basketball staff over the last two seasons, has been named full-time assistant to replace Jim Baron, who recently ac­cepted the head coaching job at St. Francis CPa.) College. 
Jeff Nix, an assistant at Xavier the past two years, will fill Kilcullen's spot on Coach Digger Phelps' staff. 
Kilcullen, 33, joined the Notre Dame staff after serving three years as an assistant at Siena College. A native of New York City, Kilcullen is a graduate of Lehman College. He coached for three years at Castleton (Vt.) State College and one year as an assistant at Delaware Valley (Pa.) Col­lege. 
Nix, 28, comes to Notre Dame after serving on former Irish assistant Pete Gillen's staff at Xavier the past two seasons. 
A native of Portville, N.Y., Nix played two seasons at Canisius College, graduating from tnere in 1980. He was an the upcoming competition despite an almost flawless win. 
"I feel nervous, I hope we'll win, but its going to be tough," said Kelly. 
The Icemen will face Still Having Fun in today's action. 
Double Decker Oreo Cookie continued its winning ways as it looks for a second champion­


ship title. The Cookies crumbled any hopes Four Rooms Make a Wall had of ad­vancing to the finals, defeating them, 21-13. Zanette Bennett led the Cookies with seven points and teammate Lavetta Willis added five. 
The luck of the Irish was not with Erin Go Braugh, which was defeated by Quixotic Quint, 21-5, despite the support of Notre Dame head basketball coach Digger Phelps, who came out to cheer on his daughter Karen. 
The Quints were led by Kathy Brommeland's six points. 
Still Having Fun will con­tinue to do so today since they defeated Heels, 21-12. Hoosier Lawyers beat Who Needs High Heels, 21-12, while Team No. 5 dropped out to the Fast Break Five. Finally, Five Girls in Search of Lare Condominiums only found disappointment against Kukla, Fran and Ollie

Nix is a veteran of the Notre Dame summer basketball camps. 
"Matt is one of the brightest young talents in the coaching profession," said Phelps. "He's been a positive factor in our success the past two seasons. We have a great tradi­tion of our assistants moving on to head their own programs, and I'm confident Matt will join those ranks some day.

Bookstore history to repeat as cham­p~n.  
There might be an upset or two along the road to the title, but I don't think anyone is in the class of Party At Chips When We Repeat, last year's Lee's BBQ Roundhouse. We'll get to the title game in a bit. Here are my picks for the quarterfinals, the semis and the final on Serene Sunday. 
Today, Party at Chips will destroy 4 Slamma Jamma. Scott Hicks can carry 4 Slamma Jamma only so long before the house of cards comes crumbling down. Party at Chips will give up no more than 13 points, as their inside game will dominate. 
Tequila White Lightning looked a little sluggish in the round of 16, but I don't see them bowing to Who's Next...Who Cares? in today's matchup. This one might be closer than a lot of people think, as the un­derdogs might fly out to a fast start and Tequila may have some early jitters. Tequila's calm in the clutch will prevail, though, in a tight one. 
Now, my colleague O'Gara gets a

little nutty, though things admittedly get tougher from here on in. I like New Order's tough inside game, but I'm going with the experience and court savvy of AI Martin and Gary Sasse, and another win for Leone's Stallions. Martin is just intense un­der pressure, Sasse can hit from anywhere, and Mike O'Grady will probably play a big factor. Look for a physical contest, with the Stallions prevailing by three or four. 
Ah, my Upset Special. I've watched Corporate ·Raiders' last three games and they've got a one­game-at-a-time attitude that doesn't fool me. This is a solid squad that can adapt to any game conditions. They can run the ball. If they can
