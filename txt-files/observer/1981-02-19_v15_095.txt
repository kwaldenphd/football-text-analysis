low tumout 
Mardi Gras receipts lag 
By LOUIS BREAUX 
StaffReporter 
" We need more poker 

players,'' was the verdict from 
) im Riedman, Mardi Gras 
business manager. According 

to Riedman, this year's Mardi 
Gras has been lagging finan­
cially behind many of the 
previous Mardi Gras. 
Riedman attributes the lag to 
the low turnout and that poker 

games are all night, every 
night and play poker, but that 
has not been happening yet,'' 
said Riedman. 
"We have guys walking around here scrapping to get a game started." 
The total revenue from the 

booths aND CONCESSIONS IS 
ABOUT $10,930 this year. In 
1979, the figure was about 
$15,500 for the same time 
period. Admission receipts 
have totaled about $5,00 and raffle ticket sales have reached nearly $16,000. The overall expenses for Mardi Gras are estimated at $20,000. 
"We are hoping for a big turnout this weekend to pull us through," said Dan McKernan, Mard1 Gras chairman. "We realioze this has been a big test week, but you only need to take a couple of hours off to come and enjoy yourself. You csn still sell a ticket boo! and get in free." 
Besides an occasional ap­pearance of loaded dice, a few stolen lollipops and mirrors, Mardi Gras has been spared 
any significant amount of 
cnme. 
Although gambling is the usual attraction at Mardi Gras, some live entertainment is featured. Thursday is Comedy and Magic Night, featuring magician Mike Weber from 8-9p.m. and agian from 11-12 
p.m. The Outcasts, an improv­Isational group, will act from 9-10 p.m. and the comedy team of Pat Byrnes and Jim McClure will perform from 10-11 p.m. 
On Friday the theme is Alum­
ni Weekend. From 7-9 p.m. 
Dan Zimmerman will perform. After Zimmerman, the band Crystal will play till 2 a.m. 
Saturday night is Awards Night. From 7·9 p.m. another quaterist, Smokey Joe, wioll perform. Afterwarcfs, Crystal will return and play till 2 a.m. The raffle for the 1981 Cutlass Supreme will held at midnight. 
The overall theme for this year's Mardi Gras is"In The News" and has produced booth designs including the War of the Worlds, the Gold Rush and the creation of man. An award is ~iven to the best booth des1gn. 
An honor is also bestowed on the booth that produces the most revenue for Mardi Gras.

no offer of compromise · y or in the future." 
Hill, however, defined Cotter's "compromise" as not 
offering any cash to the students, and that's correct." Hill stated that the only item discussed with Cotter was ''whether we were going to offer any money' to the eight students. Hill further explained that all criminal charges against the students will be handled by the county pros­ecutor. Korpal was unavailable for comment. 
Hill explained that a dis­position means if charges against the students are still pending March 18, then a trial date will be set. 
The students were arrested Jan.30 inside Corby's Tavern at 1026 Corby Street. 
Crash-landing prevents tragedy 
SANTA ANA, Cal. (AP)­Quick action by the pilot of a jetliner that was landing with 109 peoplt. abord may have helped avert tragedy when he crash-landed his plane in flames after spotting another plane on the runway, author­
ities said yesterday. 
thirty-four people were in­jured, none senously, in the accident Tuesday night at John Wayne Airport m Orange County. 
Apparently both the in­coming Air California Boeing 737 and another Air California jet bound for San Jose with 117 people aboard were cleared for the same runway at the same time, but there was no immediate comment from au­thorities on how that could happen. 
An investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board who asked not to be identified said, "It looks like we have some heroes in the crew, but that's for the investigation to decide." 
Air California spokesman Mark Peterson said, "We were very lucky that the crew per· formed in such a professional way. 
"There was no panic, and this is the tribute to all the passengers and the crew.'' 
Airport operations chief Den­is R. Horn said, "I think it was probably a combination of skill on the part of the air crew and a fortunate turn of events. The airplane didn't break up. The emergency response was out­standing." 
Horn also said it was fortu nate that the flaming jetliner came to rest in front of the airport fire station after the airline officials said. crash landing. He said rescue Both planes had been told to personnesl were at the scene abort by frantic air traffic within a minute and were able controllers who saw a collision to quickly control the fire. developing, but a witness mon­

Rapist? 

Student describes robber 
By MIKE DUPLESSIE 
News Staff 
The Notre Dame student who was robbed earlier this week has given South Bend Police a description of her assailant which closely resem­bles that of the "orange ski­masked" rapist. 
In an unreported incident that occurred on that same day, a Saint Mary's student was prep­ositioned by a man, drivmg a white van, and wearing an orange ski mask cuffed on his head. 

The Saint Mary's woman's description are very similar, no positive identification has been made as to whether this man is in fact the rapist. 
Police are still investigating the incidents.There have been no arrests or indications of any possible suspects, though police are reportedly attempt­mg to trace down any whtte vans with an orange mountain scene painted on the side. 
Housing Office to decide fate of room /picks system 
By NORMAN PLATE 
News Staff 
Although the Housing Office has not released any official information regarding the stan­dardization room picks for next year, most rectors think that the matter should remain in the hands of each dorm. 
Fr. Heppen, director of stu­dent residences, appointed the Physical Plant Committee and Student Affairs Committee to investigate the present room pick system. As ~oon as both committees recetve sugges­tions from the rectors and hall presidents, they will meet to discuss the future of room picks. 
Under the present system the method of_picking a room is decided indivtdually by each hall. One possible alternative to this system is to use a standardization method in aLL OF THE DORMS. The benefit of such a system would be the elimination of student com­plaints that another hall's sys­tem is more fait in deciding room picks. 

Most rectors, however, feel that room picks should be left up to the individual halls. Asked if he thought the room pick system should be stan­dardization, Fr.

Many other rectors agreed, stating that a room ptck system that was standard­Ized according to individual GPA would be "ludicrous." 
Inflation fighting Cooperation key to program 
WASHINGTON (AP) --Pres­ident Reagan's l?roposals for sweeping reductions in the federal budget are designed to force nearly everyone to give up somethin~ in the name of fighting mflation. But it's the marginally poor who are hit the hardest. 
The president protected from cuts the programs he said make up the "social safety net," which helps the most needy in society. 
"We will continue to fulfill the oblisations that spring from our national conscience," the president told a joint session of Congress last night. 
''Those who through no fault of their own must depend on the rest of us--the poverty stricken, the disabled, the el­derly--all those with true need can rest assured that the social safety net of programs they depend on are exept from any cuts.'' 
Beyond that safety net, Reagan's program would re­quire all Americans to pay a share of the cost of combating inflation. Theoretically, it hits everyone--big guys and little 
guys. I d · 1 · " 
''I hope 've ma e tt p am, said the president, "that our approach has been even-hand­ed, that only the programs for the deserving remain un­touched.'' 
But it's the little guys, the working poor, who also are heavily dependent on federal aid, who will lose benefits in areas like food stam,Ps, Medi­caid, public serv1ce jobs, housing and aid to dependent children. 

for them there is only a pittance from the tax cuts that benefit middle and upper in­come people far more than those at the lower end of the economic scale. 
Earlier administrations and Congresses made decisions to include the working poor among those Reagan now calls the "deserving needy." It is these decisions that Reagan proposes to reverse. 
The perception of a tilt toward the more provileged in society is likely to dominate congressional debate on the Reagan program and establish the political battle lines for the 1982 elections.

James Taylor wows 'ern at Holiday Star Theater 
W
hen audiences sec James Taylor's "Smiling Face," they smile right back-and with good reason. 
Taylor(a!Tectionately referred to asJT) entertained Saturday's sold out audience at the Merrilville, Ind., Holiday Star Theatre with such classics as "Something In the Way She Moves," "Sweet Baby James,"" How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)," and "Carolina In My Mind." 
Taylor, who graciously accepted roses and signed autographs before the show, performed most of the evening alone, solely accompanied by acoustic guitar. The singer did, however, employ the efforts of Dan Dugmore on p~:dal steel, Leland Sklar on bass, Rick Marotta on drums and Ed Kalowski on keyboards. 
Last Saturday's performance, billed as" An Acoustical Evening with James Taylor," was the last of Taylor's four-day stay at the Holiday Star. The theatre, located on Indiana interstate 1-65 South, will tout such stars as Anne Murray, Barry Manilow, Gor­don Lightfoot, Tom Jones and Sammy Davis, Jr., in the next few months. 
Throughout his performance, Taylor's voice sounded strong and clear-faltering only on a few selections. Unfortunately, both" Mexico" and" Fire and Rain" were disappointments, for Taylor added little variation to either tune. JT, however, over­shadowed any weak performances with the general consistancy of his fluid vocals. 
The artist maintained a conversational atmosphere with his audience, often supplying explanations for specific tunes. Before performing" Mona," a song about a pig given to him for his 21st birthday, Taylor described the animal as "tight like a football," and added the pig "thought (he) was its mother." 
Taylor appeared relaxed, shedding·his shoes early in the performance and often acknowledging the ·rowd' s applause and verbal praise. In contrast to a

C
onductor Newton Wayland and the Midwest Pops Orchestra will present "The Best of Broad­way: Past and Present" featuring mezzo-soprano Jan Curtis next Sunday, February 22 at 7:30p.m. at Cen­
tury Center. The program is a selection of Broadway's memorable melodies featuring the music of Leonard Bernstein, Romberg, Porter, Berlin, Gershwin, Kurt Weill, .Hamlisch and Wayland. Tickets arc $6 for students and may be obtained at the South Bend Symphony office (232-6343) and at the Centur Center Box Office (284-9111 ). 
performance last August at Indianapolis' Market Square Arena, Taylor appeared totally at horne in the Holiday Star. 
JT provided his own background vocals, with assis­tance from a reel-to-reel tape recorder that accom­panied him during" Baby, It's Cold Outside," and "Shower The People." In addition to hits, audience members heard a variety of selections, such as "Mill worker (originally written for a Broadway play which opened and closed within two weeks)" from the Flag album, "Captain Jim's Drunken Dream" from In the Pocket and "Soldiers" from Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon. Continuously, Taylor il­lustrated his skills on acoustic guitar, performing such songs as "Steamroller," "Blossom" and "Gorilla" with a natural ease. Taylor did combine his instrumen­tal talent with his vocal one to produce a true "acoustical evening." 
JT also performed a selection from his new album, Dad Loves His Work, which will be released March 9. "Sugar Trade," written a·bout people in the triangle trade of the 1700's, is a tune that Taylor said "looks good and sounds nice."" Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight," a hit from Taylor's album, One Man Dog, and" Long Ago and Far Away," from Mud Slide Slim 
were also performed with gentle percussion and 
guitar. "You've Got A Friend~' made popular by 
both Taylor and singer Carole King (who is also the 
song's composer) concluded JT's performance, ac­
companied by only one encore ("You Can Close Your 
Eyes"), unlike the usual two or three stage reap­
pearances ACC concert goers are familiar with. 
In the selection "Secret 0' Life," Taylor advised 
listeners "the secret of life is enjoying the passage of 
time." Any passage of time with James Taylor, 
however, is too enjoyable to be kept secret.

As a special feature, "Smoky Joe" has added a moody blues segment to his program, especially for those students who will be mtssing this year's Midwest Blues Festival. 
"Smoky Joe" will also feature many of the songs from his albums, especially .A Qtu!stion of Love, which i~ availble in the Bookstore. 

Quiz XIII: Reunions 
T
here weren't quite as many obvious answers in las~eek's 4uiz. 
However, if you could have grabbed the right resources, you 
would have been able to answer all ten of the second part of the quiz 
(I .name the artist, you name the song) with no trouble at all. As you 
will see by the answers below, I'm sure you will recognize many of 
the songs and artists, since most were released during the seventies. 
There was also a neat coincidence in last Thursday's Observer; 
more specific details can also be found below. 
This week's quiz is about something which is happening more and 
more-reunions. Most groups which reunite do so because their 
former members have trouble with solo careers. Many groups other 
than the qnes I will quiz you on attempted this, some quite success­
fully, some not. A few examples follow. 
The Lovin' Spoonful, one of the most successful singles groups of 
1966 and 1967, broke up in 1968. It was twelve years before a 
reunion took place. In Paul Simon's 1980 movie One-Trick Pony, 
the original members appear together again as the Lovin' Spoonful. 
Creedence Clearwater Revival, perhaps the most successful 
American group of the early seventies, was together for years 
before hitting the big time in 1968. Tom Fogerty, one of the original 
members, left in 1971. The rest of the group hung together for one 
more album before breaking up for good... until late last year. The 
original four members played a45-rninute set at Torn Fogerty's wed­
ding. Since then, negotiations have been underway for a possibl~ 
reunion album. 
There have been many others which have done the same as the 
above groups. Ten of them are described in the below quiz. 
Your task is to nane the t group I am referring to. 
I. One of the bands most of today' s heavy-metal groups point to as an influence had three top ten hits in the late sixties and broke up in 1972. They reunited in 1974 with a Top 40 single called "Straight Shootin' Woman." 
2. 
They broke up in 1969, but after having no American success as solo artists, reunited late in 1970-and became the top-selling group of the last decade. 

3. 
They broke up with little fanfare in 1974, after their first (and only) number one album. Various combinations of the members of the group recorded unsuccessful albums until they reunited in 1978. Their comeback hit was "Steppin' in a Slide Zone." 

4. 
One of the most heralded groups ever when they formed in 1969, they doubled their membership in 1970, and were no more in 1971. Most of the 1970 version of the group reunited in 1974 for a concert tour, and then promptly broke up again; in 1977, the three original members got back together for one album and their only Top Ten single, one of the shortest hit songs of the late seventies. 

5. 
The most successful duet of the sixties, they have reunited several times in the ensuing years-in 1972 for a benefit concert, in 1975 for a top-ten single, and in 1978 for a top-20 single (with partial credit given to a third performer). 

6. 
A successful black duo in the late sixties, they stopped having hits and broke up in the early seventies. The male half of the original duet teamed up with a new partner, kept the same name, and carne back to the charts with a vengeance in 1979. 

7. 
One of the original British groups, with hits like" Don't Throw Your Love Away" and "When You Walk Into the Room," they went the way of most early British groups, breaking up in obscurity in the early seventies. Reuniting in the late seventies with all but one of the original members, they released a critically acclaimed but commercially ignored self-titled album. 

8. 
After their last 45, recorded in 1967 but released in 1969, hit number one, they broke up. In 1978 they reunited and recorded an album aptly titled Reunion. They still do many concerts as a group. 

9. 
This group of respected session musicians had eleven Top40 hits from 1970 to 1973 inclusive. They broke up because two mem­bers of the group complained that their songs were never released as singles, among other things. After unsuccessful solo careers, they reunited late in 1976, had a top-ten single, and broke up for the same reason they broke up the first time. 

10. 
This well-known band had close to a dozen personnel changes from the time they first appeared in 1965 until their breakup in the early seventies. The original members reunited in IIJ73 for a now­obscure self-titled album. Most ofthe original band reunited again in 1979, recording an album using a different name, featuring the hit single "Don't You Write Her Off."

Hard -work pays off for Sitlington 

By ED KONRADY 
Sports Writer 
"Since I didn't play much last year, I'm someone people can look to as an example. If they work hard they co_uld improve, and achieve something." 
Mary Pat Sitlington has devel­oped into an intregal part of the Saint Mary's basketball team. Sitlington, a sophomore center from Frankfort, Ill., averages 9. 7 points, (third on the team) and six rebounds (second on the team) a game. Her best game was against Goshen, when she pumped in 14 points and yanked down 12 rebounds. 
The laughter came often, and in abundance, as I interviewed Sitlin~ton. Her good humor is a defimte asset for the team. "Mary Pat will try to pick up a couple of the players on the team who aren't playing so well," says Head Coach Jerry Dallessio. ''She tries to encour­age them, and help them to overcome their slump." 
While Sitlington's off-court behavior is engaging, it is her long-range shooting that 
earned  her  a  place  on  the  
Belles.  During  the  Saint  
Mary's  Roundball  Classic  

Tournament, Sitlington was six 
for nine against Illinois Ben­edictine College and seven for nine against Findlay College, with most of her shots coming from the 15-25 foot range. 
''I see Mary Pat as a scorer, someone who can shoot the ball from the outside, and balance out the outside shoot­ing of Anne Armstrong," says Dallessio. "I think it's hard for a team to will consistantly if you depend on one player to shoot the ball from the outside. With Mary Pat and Anne in 
there,  we  have  a  nice  bal­ 
ance.''  
Sitlington's emergence  as  a  

major force for the Belles is a direct result of the improve­ment in the other Facets of her game. 
"Mary Pat's really rounded out her game," commented Dallessio. "I would say that earlier in the season, if she didn't score, her contribution wasn't as great. Now she is playing good defense and be­coming more aggressive under the boards, she can play a good game, not score as much, and still make a contribution to the team. 
"Defensively, Mary Pat's im­proved tremendously. She still needs some work, but her man-to-man and zone defense 

National champs, or team of the month? 

Notre Dame and Virginia, Oh my! 

To he sure, Dick Enberg will let loose with a few of the exclamations that arc fast becoming his trademark when the Irish and Cavaliers tangle in the Rosemont Horizon Sunday. And with good reason. There will be more than passing interest in the clash, especially since Ralph Sampson and the Pour Dwarfs will come into Chicago with an umblemished record. 
Yes, there'll be plenty of oh mys Sunday, but something will be missing· -what if. As in, what if Notre Dame be'ats Virginia? Or what if Virginia beats Notre Dame'? 
Thanks to the NCAA and its money-grubbing policies, Sunday's battle royale won't amount to a hill of beans. Virginia is going to the NCAA tournament. Notre Dame is going to the NCAA tournament. And so are a lot of schools that shouldn't be. 
The list of conferences which automatically send their champion to the tournament is, ub, fascinating. My personal favorite is the Trans-America Athletic Conference. It sounds like an airline. Come fly with us, the Trans­America Athletic Conference. At least the schools could save on travel expenses. 
But there are others. most of them you've even heard of. The ECAC, the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference and the Ivy League immediately spring to mind. Sure, there may be a decent team or two in each of those conferences, but they shouldn't get an automatic bid just by beating up on Clay Middle School and the Mishawaka Cavemen. If a team is deserving, it should get an at-large bid. 
Monetary considerations won't allow it, but the time has come for the NCAA to pare its field to 32 teams and adopt a double-elimination format. Too many good teams fall prey to a pumped-up underdog and an off-day. 
Tough luck, you say? Maybe. But we're supposedly trying to determine the national champion, not the Team of the Month for March, 1981. Last year, Louisville was the Team of the Month for March, but DePaul owned bragging rights for most of December, January and February. So who was the best team? 
Every once in a while an underdog reaches the Final Four, but even 
blind s4uirrels find nuts. Two years ago, Penn dodged a couple of bullets 
to survive the East Regional and promptly was thrashed by Michigan 
State, 101-67, in the semifinals. Is this the kind of basketball we want to 
sec in the Final Four? 
This is by no means an elitist assault on less prestigious conferences. It 
is utter nonsense that the Big Ten and Atlantic Coast conferences should 
place five teams in the tournament, even if Iowa did reach the 1980 Final 
Pour. 
Flooding the NCAA tournament with 64 teams renders almost every 
regular-season game meaningless. Can't we learn anything from the NBA 
besides how to shatter a backboard? 
Maybe a few good teams would get left out, but that's far better than 
letting a bunch of also-rans in. 
As it is now, there is only one "what if' about Sunday's game-what if 
the roof of the Horizon falls in again? 
has improved tremendously 
since last year.. Mary Pat's rebounding has become much more aggressive. She's block­ing out more, and is going to the boards consistently. As far as t'm concerned, Mary Pat is the most improved player on 
the team. 
The weakest point in Siding­ton's ~arne, according to Dallessto, is her willingness to go inside for closer shots. ''Mary Pat needs to drive to the basket a little more to complement her shootins. She knows it, and we're workmg on it. I think that with Mary Pat's outside shooting ability, if she'd learn to fake the shot and drive a little more, she'd be much more effective, because people would have to respect 1' her ability to shoot as well as to drive. That's when Mary Pat will start becoming a complete offensive player.'' An excellent indicator of Sit­lington' s defensive improve­ment is her rise to second on the team in defensive points. Defensive points, a category Dallessio devised, is the com­bined total of defensive rebounds, steals, charges t~en, and loose-ball recov­

study in the sunshine at the crossroads. 

In many ways, college prepares you to think independently. That's a great quality for an engineer to have. But just as important is the ability to work effectively on a team. We've found that the results of team work are much, much greater than the sum of the parts. That's why Fluor, one of the country's largest and leading engineer­ing and construction firms, is organized totally around the team concept.  
As a new engineer you'll be assigned to a project that matches your 
abilities and Interests. You'll stay with the project from start to 
finish, all the while developing new skills and polishing your ability 
to contribute as a task force member. We think the approach 
makes you more capable of Independent creativity, not less. At the 
same time you're in the perfect position to learn from more experi­
enced professionals who come from many disciplines. For the new 
graduate in particular, that is a productive place to be. 
So if you're thinking about your potential In the job market, why not think about doubling it? Let us tell you more about the Fluor team and about the great salary, full benefits and advancement po­tential that make us a top Fortune 500 company. We will be Inter­viewing on campus Friday, ~e~r:._uary 27, 1981 for the following disciplines:

One of those "few more" that the Irish hope to land is another Parade All-American, Van Pearcy. Capable of playing both running back and wide reciever, Pearcy had originally signed a non-bindins confer­ence letter-of-intent wtth South­ern Methodist. However, an investigation of the SMU athlet­ic department by the NCAA has prompted Pearcy to keep open other avenues. 
Assistant head coach Brian Boulac spent Wednesday night in Pearcy's home town, An­drews, Texas, and plans on staying there until the highly­touted speedster makes a ftnal decision. Pearcy would like to couple his collegiate football­playing days with a track ca­reer. During his sophomore season, Pearcy ran a 9.5 in the 100-yacd dash. He followed that a year later with a personal best :46.9 flat-out in the 440-yacd dash. 
Reportedly, a 4.0 student, Pearcy has also long-jumped 24-6. 
Notre Dame, of course, did not land everyone it had hoped to. Lineman Bill Fralic, Pa­rade's Player of the Year, has apparently written off Notre Dame. The Pittsburgh native called a press conference for early this morning, at which time he was expected to an­nounce he would stay at home and attend the University of

Other top high school seniors around the country, and their choice of schools, ace: quarter­back Fred Buckley of Ft. Lau­derdale to Stanford; tackle Doug Williams of Cincinatti Moeller to Kentucky; quarter­back Sean Salisbury of Escon­dido, Calif., to Southern Cal; quanerback Mack Rypien of SJ?okane to Washington State; wtde reciever Brent Duhon of Port Arthur, Tex., to University of Texas; and tight end Nick Mecrick (brother of Notre Dame's Tom) of Bethel Pack, Pa., to Virginia.

the rule. Head Coach Digger Phelps has gone on record as saying Kelly is his most charis­matic player and that Kelly recieves more mail than anyone else in his ten years at Notre Dame. 
"I never expected the mail," Tripucka says. "I still don't know how to handle it. I get between 300 and 400 letters a year from Hawaii, Maine and even overseas. People want programs and pictures and sweat bands. The want to be a pact of my life and I don't know how to handle it. If I do badly, I feel like I've let them down. They take the time to write and I really appreciate it. I answer what I can but my life is limited around here with school a~d

''The letters have become a pan of me," he continues. ''And if I really stand back and take a look at tt, I begin to feel like I'm doing something for them if I play well.'' 
But along with that fame comes stories that ace blown out of proportion. With Tripu­cka that story is his relation­ship--or lack of it--with Digger. ''That's what they want to write. Sure we have problems," Kelly grants. "But 90-95 per­cent of the time he is my best friend. I can go to him with any problem whether it be basket· ball, school, or personal life. To say he goes one way and I go another is a lie. He'll stick up for me, and I'll stick up for 
h.
tm. " 

In his four seasons, Kelly has ftrmly established his name in the Notre Dame record book. He is the ftfth all-time leading scorer, and among the leaders in fteld goal percentage, free throws made and number of games played. Like all good things, however, it will come to an end in May as Kelly will have new roads to travel. 
"I'd be lying to say I wasn't interested tn the pros," Kelly says. "It's what I wanted to do ever since I was a little kid. I'd like to J?lay and broadcast at the same ttme. I know it would be difficult. My ftrst priority is to play." 
But ftrst comes Kelly and his fellow seniors' goal that they set for themselves four years ago--the Spectrum on March
