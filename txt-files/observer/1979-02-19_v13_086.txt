Hesburgh declares parietals m.ust stand 
by Ann Gales News Editor 
University President Theodore Hesburgh rejected the Campus Life Council's proposal to reduce parietals to a hall offense on Friday, saying that such a change would eventually "erode the present regulation to meaninglessness.'' The rejection came in a letter addressed to Student Body President Andy McKenna, which appears on today's Editorial page. 
In his letter, Hesburgh stressed the importance of parietals at Notre Dame, stating, The present system of parietals is very much a part of what the University stands for: standards that are higher than most universities, but which can create an atmosphere conducive to education and growth, if they are observed.'' 
"One does not grow by eliminating or ignoring reasonable standards, but by observing them,'' he added. 
Hesburgh also commented, ''I am not naive enough to imagine there is no hanky panky here. If people really want to get into trouble, they will find a way of doing so, whatever the rules. However, it is not a permanent living condition here. Bad situations, when they come to light, are judiciable according to a single standard.'' 
In conclusion, Hesburgh srud that he believed the present parietals system to to "generally healthy, wholesome and goOd." 
The issue of Jurisdiction over parietals first surfaced when parietals was themain topic of discussion at a students' rights forum held Sept. 
28. At the forum, Dean of Students James Roemer stated, "The rationale behind parietals has nothing to do with sexuality." Rather, he said, "It is a quiet hour type of thing where at certain times that hall is supposed to be quiet and other people are supposed to be out of the hall.'' 
Questioning this rationale, students at the forum asked Roemer why panetals violations could not be dealt with by hall judicial boards if the Plll"P.Ose of parietals was merely to protect the privacy of hall residents. Roemer responded that while hall boards d1d not then have jurisdiction over parietals, it would be possible for students, using the University President Fr. Theodore Hesburgh rejected the ac

Destroying troops 


Chinese attack Vietnamese 
TOKYO (AP) Vietnam claimed yesterday it had inter­cepted all prongs of a Chinese attack on five-northern provinces, killing more than 1,000 Chinese troops and destroying about 60 
Chinese tanks  in  two  days  of  
fighting.  
''Many  columns  of  Chinese  

aggressor trOOJ?S were intercept­
ed and are bemg encircled and strongly attacked,'' said the Viet­nam news agency, monitored in Bangkok. It said the main action was in Hoang Len Sonn, Cao Bang and Lang Son provinces.

Starting today the LaFortune Student Center will be open 24 hours daily, except Sunday morn­ings from 3 a.m. to 10 a.m. 
This project, sponsored by the Student Government, will im­prove the access of students to LaFortune, which has been "a long-standing problem in the minds of students here at Notre Dame,'' according to Andrew McKenna, Student Body Presi­dent. 
The areas being opened would include the Rathskellar, the first floor lobby, and the Ballroom. The Huddle would continue to operate at its regular hours· 7:30

The extended hours of LaFortune will be in effect for a trial period until March 19.. At the end of this period, represen­tatives and Student Affrurs will meet to assess the results of the program. An evalution will then be made as to whether or not to extend this program.

Carroll Hall releases survey results 
bv Tim Sullivan StaffReporter 
Results of a survey on student 
opinion regarding parietals were 
released to the Observer last 
night by Carroll Hall representa­
tives. The survey, which was 
administered by the HPC and 
financed by the Student Govern­
ment, revealed that the vast 
majority of res_pondants were in 
favor of reducmg parietals to a 
hall offense. 
Phil Wildenhain, Carroll resi­
dent, stated that a presentation 
of the results would be brought to 
the HPC tomorrow night and that 
"action will be recommended." 
In regards to what specific 
action the HPC may elect to take, 
Tim Coonan, Carroll representa­
tive, responded, "We want to see 
how the Hall Presidents react to 
the survey first, before we come 
up with a concrete proposal. 
However, we feel that the 
student responses warrant a lot 
of thinkin~ by students, the 
administration, and the student 
government on this issue. ' ' 
In response to University Pres­
ident Fr. Theodore M. 
Hesburgh's rejection of the CLC 
parietals -proposal to reduce 
violaitons to a hall offense, Chris 
Stoushton, Carroll resident, said 
that It was "expected. " 
''In light of the survey results, 
one wonders if the administration 
is really in touch with the 
students,'' Stoughton explained. 
''The results of the survey, and 
the CLC proposal rejection, indi­
cate that the students and the 
administration are at two oppo­
site poles,'' Coonan agreed. 
Andy McKenna, Student Body 
President, stated that the 
Student Government "had per­
cieved a difference · of r opinion 
(on the parietals issue) six 
months ago, and that is why we 
came up the the CLC proposal.'' 
''We ve taken the issue as far 
as we can. All our channels have 
been exhausted, and there are no 
more constructive steps avail­
able," McKenna explained. 
"We have hope that his survey 
and action wh1ch stems from It 
will open the lines of communica­
tion between the administration 
and the students," said Stough­

Newscarriers fight for court time 
INDIANAPOliS [AP] -News­paper deadbeats beware! A state legislator is sponsoring a bill to make it easier for young paper carriers to sue customers who don't pay up.

Rep. William Roach, who in­troduced a bill to waive the $10 court filing fee for paper carriers under 18, remembers his own experiences trying to collect from customers on his route. 
'I was a newspaper carrier for five years backin the 1940s. I delivered the Cincinnati Enquirer and it was rriy sole source of income," he satd. "When I'd go around to collect, I'd have people pee_ping behind the curtai~. I ve had them slam the door m my face. I've had them put their dogs on me." 
'Parents get real incensed.' 
So the West Terre Haute Democrat decided to do some­thing for the carriers. H_is position is simple: "When a kid gets up at five o'clock in the morning so you can have your paper, he deserv!!s.' t? be_ paid." 
The way the s1tuatton 1s now, Roach siad, "our courts are structured so that truly small claims are just forgotten.'' · 
"A kid's got five deadbeat customers who haven't been paying him. He has to come up with $50 on the chance of maybe getting $30 back,'' Roach ex­plained. "So many haven't ftled because they're afraid to file." 
Rc>ach said he is concerned that even though the filing fee is returned if the plaintiff is suc­cessful in his SUit, it is denying youngsters access to the legal system. 
And the youngsters aren't the only· ones who are upset by customers who don't pay up. "Parents get real incensed," 
Roach said. ''Not only are you gypping their kids out of their rightful due, but parents have got a lot of time and effon invested, 
too. They're out there folding papers, it's a real family pro­Ject.'' 
One parent who is interested in Roach's bill is former state Rep. Roben Mahowald. His 12-year­old son, John, has a paper route on Indianapolis' northeast side and occasionally has problems with customers who don't pay. 
''A small claims court judge came out to talk to John's class right around Christmas,'' Mahowald said. "He found out all about filing suit. He was all for it." 
One of John's /roblem cus­tomers, Mahowal said was a man named Norman who lived in an apanment complex. 
''Not too long after the judge came to his class, ] ohn saw Norman,'' Mahowald said. "John told him, 'If you don't pay up, I'm going to sue you and Ive already talked to the judge.' 
John got his money and now they're friends."

Deceitful misrepresentation 
Father Hesburgh's letter in which he rejects the Campus Life Council's (CLC) proposal to make parietals a hall offense is four months too late. A similar letter, indicating Hesburgh's understanding of the purpose of parietals should have been released immediately following the student rights forum. For four months students and the CLC have been under the impression that the Administration regarded parietals as ''q_uiet hours," and the Administration perpetuated this decettful misrepresentation. 
The reason the CLC went through the "proper channels" in making its proposal to reduce parietals to a hall offense was because they were led to believe parietals were "quiet hours." Dean ofStudentsJames Roemer made a statement to that effect at the students rights forum last Sept. 26. Roemer said, "The rationale behind parietals has nothing to do with sexuality. It is a quiet hour type of thing where at certain times, that hall is supposed to get quiet and other people are supposed to be out of the hall." 
When students questioned why they could not set their own "quiet hours," Roemer suggested students use the a.c to present any proposals which they might have for change. At their Oct. 9 meeting, the CLC ratified a proposal to redefme parietals as a hall offense. 
That proposal was presented to Father John Van Wolvlear, Vice-President for Student Affairs, who lwl been at the student rights forum, and refused to comment on the parietals issue, claiming that he was ignorant of its history. Van Wolvlear delayed resJ?Onding, presumably while he was researching the issue, until1ust before Thanksgiving break. At that time, Van Wolvlear reJected the proposal. 
The proposal was subsequently resubmitted to University provost, Dr. Timothy O'Meara, who also rejected the proposal, this time over Christmas break. Followin~ O'Meara's rejection ofthe proposal, Carroll Hall abolished panetals, hoping to elicit some sort of articulation of why parietals exist. Meanwhile the QC appealed O'Meara's decision to Hesbur~h. 
Hesburgh's rejection of this proposal ts based on an understanding of parietals that is fundamentally different from that stated by ~oemer at ~e s~d~nt ri~hts forum. . For Hesburgh the rauonale for par1etals 1s mextncably woven m the sexuality issue. This is radically different from Roemer's understanding. 
If the . difference between Hesburgh's and Roemer's understanding of the reason behind the parietals system is that great, why did not Hesburgh issue a statement at the time of the forum? 
Hesburgh always refers students to the ''proper channels'' when they are attempting to bring about change. In this case the ''proper channels' ' prolonged the misunderstanding of the University's position. How can Hesburgh expect students to believe in the effectiveness of the "proper channels" when the University perpetuates ambiguous positions? It is now obvious that Roemer's position on parietals as stated at the student rights forum is not the same as that of the University. Why did not Hesburgh make this clear at the time of Roemer's statements? 
By refraining from comment until now, Hesburgh has wasted the time ofthe CLC and cast doubt on the effectiveness of using

Fr. Hesburgh replies to CLC 
Editor's Note: The following letteris Father Hesburgh 's rejec­tion ofthe Campus life Council's proposal. The proposal would reduce parietals to a hall offense. Andy M&Kenna, Student Body President, will state his reaction 
to this letter on the next editorial page. 
Dear Andy: I am responding to your letter 
regarding  the  redeftnition  of  
parietafs.  Through you, I know  
that  tlus  is  addressed  to  the  

Student Body that you serve as President, as I do, too. 
The present system ofparietals is very much a part of what this University stands for: standards that are higher than most univer­sities, but which can create an atmosphere conducive to educa­tion and growth, if they are observed. 
Some thirty pages of former rules, some of which in the present world could well be considered Mickey Mouse, have been reduced to the essentials, about a half dozen University­wide rules that express what is expected, as a bare minimum, of Notre Dame students: personal honesty, integrity, care for others, their well-being, their welfare, and their rights, self­respect a~d self-growth for one's self. 
One does not grow by eliminat­ing or ignoring reasonable stan­dards, but by observing them. I am willing to admit that most ' universities do not establish such standards --especially in the matter of parietals --or insist upon them. We do. 
Present parietals allow visita­tion more than half of every day. Presumably, there must be some time for sleeping, studying, and other activities during the other half which is only ten hours of non-visitation over the weekends. 
Parietals also insure a m~cum of privacy in men's and women's residence halls which have a quite different character and life of their own. 
A distinguished professor­friend of mine at one of our very best universities told me that one of his freshman woman students came to him in desperation during late October. The day after her arrival at this univer­sity, her roommate's boyfriend moved in. From then on she was reduced to sleeping in an adjacent study room. She had no prtvacy, no access to her clothes and other accessories, even though the other couple said, . "]ust walk in on us, watch if you wish, we don't care." 
The best my professor-friend could do was to get her assigned to another room when one was available. They had no parietals so ~hat was going on was not agamst any rule. 
I am not naive enough to ima~ine that there is no hanky­panky here. Ifpeople reallY. want to get into trouble, they will find a way of doing so, whatever the rules. However, it is not a permanent living condition here. Bad situations, when they come to light, are judiciable according to a single standard. 
Reducing parietals to the will of each individual hall would, in fact, give 22 different regulations rather than the one University­wide regulation now in effect. Over time, it would erode the present regulation to meaning­lessness --and then we would be like everyone else. Neither the Trustees, nor I, nor the Provost, nor the Student Affairs Vice President want this to happen. guess each one of us must m turn say so, and we do. 
I do not expect this to be a popular decision, but right deci­sions, those that uphold stan­dards that give a place and its people character, rarely are, expecially among those who want to reduce everything to mushy mediocrity, where everything goes and life is reduced to the least common denominator. 
It would be a lot easier just to say veto, Andy, but since you have asked for a rationale as well, I ungladly expose myself to all those who know better. Knowin~ this student body, I'll get credit for honesty, even though I know that cannot always be extended to agreement. After all, a university is a place where most people think otherwise. No one IS or should be bashful about voicing an opinion. However, the buck must stop somewhere. Those who have the responsi­bility for the ultimate decision and the common good must take the heat or get out of the kitchen, to paraphrase Harry Truman. 
May I say in closing that if we practiced in loco parentis in the accepted sense, we would still have the thirty pages of rules and no visitation whatever. However, I believe that the present system is generally healthy, wholesome, and good, Brian Hogan to the contrary notwithstanding. We would like to preserve that good, even improve it. Removing or emasculating parietals does not seem to be a move in that :lirection. 
Devotedly yours in Notre Dame, 
(Rev.) Theodore M Hesburgh, 
C.S.C. President 


The soft underbelly 
art buchwald 

WASHINGTON--There has been a great deal ofrecrimination over the change of governments in Iran. One of the biggest questions being asked is why no one in this town knew the shah was in trouble. Some of the credit for this must go to Ambassador Ardeshir Zahedi, and Washington's unquenchable appetite for ~ood caviar. 
Before it 1s published by the new regime at the Iranian Embassy, I wish to confess that my wife and I were on Ambassador Zahedi's special caviar list, 1 which meant that every Christmas Eve we would fmd a nice plump can of it on our doorstep when we went out to light the Christmas tree. The ftrst time there was no message with the can except for a card attached, which satd "Long live the Shah.'' 
"I wonder who it's from?" my wife asked. 
"It beats1 me," I said, salivating. "All it says on the can Dominican Republic,'' my wife said as she started making toast. 
is  . 'Golden  pearls  from  the  
Caspian Sea.'  
"Well,  that  rules  out  the  

"Wait a minute," I warned her. "This could be a bribe. People don't just leave caviar on your doorstep unless they want something in e~change.'' 
'What could anyone want in chan £ f d li · 
:viar?~e or a can o e clOUS "My Redskin tickets," I said. 
· 

"But they're not gomg to get
them--not for all the caviar in Zambia.   
"_I di~' t kno~ Zambia had any ca~~ar, .s~e satd. 
That s JUSt my cod~ ~e for the c~~try wherd £!Unk tt came from. 
On Christmas Day we went to visit friends who worked in the State Department on the Middle East desk. "Have some caviar," the former ambassador said. 
"No, thanks," I said. "We're going over to Adm. Pinkerton's tonight for caviar and baked potato and we don't want to spoil our appetites.'' 
The day after Christmas our son, who plays with a boy whose 
father is in the CiA, said, ''Ifyou 
think we have caviar you should 
see the Dinkham's fridge. It's 
loaded with ftsh eggs." 
"That's too bad. I thought 
we'd share ours with them sincel 
ftgured by being government 
employees they probably never 
got to eat any."
"Mr. Dinkman says you're nothing ifyou don't have a caviar 
source at the CIA." 
Whatever else you want to say 
about Ambassador Zahedi he 
certainly was lavish with his 
country's edibles. Almost every­one I knew of importance in the capital was up to his hips in . sturgeon eggs. Zahedi had penetrated the soft underbellly of Washington, and as long as the stuff kept coming no one was really interested in how the shah 
was doing. 
I guess this should be a lesson 
toallofus. Thenexttimewefind 
a can of caviar on our doorsteps 
we're going to ask some tough 
questions about the regime's 
survival before we start chopping 
up eggs, onions and cutting up 
lemons.

Prayer Never 

She is a senior whom I had only gotten to know slighdy the previous three years; so when she made an appoint­ment, I had no idea what she wished to speak about. 
I was, I have to admit, startled when she got right to the point and said, "Teach me to pray." She went on to explain that she had tried to be concerned about prayer through the years, but wasn't really sure what it was all about, or how to go about it ... and felt that prayer was certainly one of the things she ought to give some attention to before graduating. 
We talked for a long time; but there were a few things we found most critical to understanding prayer. First of all, I suggested she get prepared for the shock of discoverin~ that prayer is probably just the oppostte of what she thought. It is not asking; it is answering. 
This ftrst problem with prayer is increasingly accentuated for me the longer I am associated with Notte Dame athletics. Just last Sunday after the UCLA basketball game, for exam,Ple, numerous people were saying things like, "Should have .prayed harder, Father" or "Well, your prayers didn't work today, did they?" 
When my prayers do "work," as, say, in the "miraculous" comeback at the Cotton Bowl, what. am I supposed to think? That the prayers of the Houston fans didn't work? The God I believe in doesn't cause fumbles or help with freethrows; and His mother wasn't specially assigned to assist Joe Montana's fourth-quarter heroics. God doesn't win games; men and women do this. God's desire is to win people. 
The difficulty I'm speaking of centers around the so-called prayer of petition.Je.sus seems to ~n~ourage our asking for t~ngs. l:fe expltctdy says, "ask, and it wtll be gtven you; search, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.'' Well, we've done all that loads of times and it hasn't worked. What is this, a cruel game God plays with us? We've engaged in prayer time and time again; but, more often than not, we haven't received any answer--to our asking, searching, knockin~. 
Perhaps we need to perstst more: one more novena, one more candle lighted at the grotto, one more rosary, the nine 
His pipe is every bit a part of the man as his salt and pepper beard. Myron Farber is a short man in height only, not in stature. He stands tall in the eyes of his contemporaries because of his con­crete convictions. 
Thirteen years ~· the New-York Tunes ass~ him to investigate reports of thirteen mysterious deaths at a major New Jersey hospital. Farber's 
seriesof reports caused die reopening of the case and the eventual indictment of the Riverdell Hospital's chief surgeon, Dr. ) asca.l.evich. 
Years later, Farber's articles caused the second longest murder trial in U.S. history. His re(>Orting also turned the case into a constitutional battle between the ftrst amendment (the right to free speech and press) versus the sixth amendment (the right to a fair trial). 
Mike, as Farber prefers to be called by his friends, went to jail for fifty days instead of turning over his notes at the murder trial. 
"If you believe in something strong enough, you should not let anyone or anything change your mind or stand in your way," he srud. 
''Press sources have the right to remain confidential, much like the confidentiality between a patient and his doctor, or between a penitent and his confessor." His reasons for withholding his notes was to protect the identity of trusted sources. 
Clad in jeans and a black T-shirt with white letters which said 'I defend the ftrst amendment,' Mike practices what · he preaches. Puffing on his pipe, he emphatically stated, ''I did not witness the crime and my notes do not establish the guilt or innocence of Dr. Jascalevich.'' 
Mike walked over to the coffee table, picked Ul;> a copy of The New York Times and admitted that he barely had enough time to read the paper lately. The Times gave him an extended leave to give lectures around the country and to write a book. 
First Fridays one more time! Jesus seems to agree--in the parable about the widow who doesn't _give up appealing to the judge until he finally gives in. This seems a straightforward admonition to pers!=vere in prayer; we are called to be persistent when we pray. We are reminded of Robert Louis Stevenson's remark: ''lhe saints are the sinners who kept trying." 
This seems to put the major emphasis on our efforts to get through to God. He's like the judge; we have to wear Him down with a dogged persistence (something like a salesman making his pitch to a tough-to-sell client.). We sense there's somethin~ wrong in this, however. We fmd 1t repugnant to employ such a close comparison between God and the evil judge in the gospel story. We don't fed at all attracted to a God for whom we have to fulftll predetermined demands before He will respond. That contradicts the God Jesus reveals. 
!he fact is this, interpretation twists thmgs completely. The idea is not our trying to get through to God, but His attempti~g ~o get thr~mgh to us. We may be mcltned to think that prayer is our "working on God," but it's just the opposite. It works on us; opens us to the persuing God. 
Prayer is our answer, not God's. He pursues us; constantly would afford us an experience ofHis loving presence; He speaks a word of invitation ("Come, be 
In rebuttal to the claims that he refused to give his notes to the trial judge because he is writing a book, Mike responded, "I accepted a $75,000 ad.­vance on my book about the case back in 1976. That was lon~ before my notes became a controversial issue." 
"I have the greatest respect for the Times. I never would do anything that would discredit them,'' Mike said. The judge initially fined the Times $100,000 plus $5,000 a day until the notes were confiscated. According to published accounts, the fines totalled $285,000 and the legal costs snowballed to over $200,000. 
'I love to write. In fact, if I had to pick between sex or journalism, I would select ... '' Mike paused a moment before answering in order to fill his empty glass with Beaujolais ... ''journalism,'' he concluded. 
Since he has become a new figure, Mike has been invited to speak at numerous conferences. He commented, "I am a writer, not a speaker. Before lectures, I prepare notes and end up not following them. I improvise adding new ideas. However, my innermost ideas and convictions always seem to emerge.'' 
Mike received a B.A. at the University of Maryland in 1959. He did graduate work in American history at Northwest­!=rn. Besides being a Times reporter, he 1s the father of two children. 
His family shares his convtctions. He recalls once as he was /oing to jail, reporters approached an 1V cameras focused on Farber's 6-year-old daughter. When asked how she felt about her daddy going to jail, she replied, "We have to do what we feel is right.'' Farber smiled and said "She heard it at home." 
All ofus should have the convictions to follow our beliefs and do what we feel is right. Convictions are the fuel for a meanin~ life. Myron Farber is a man of convtction and his admirable stand is an inspiration to other kindred spirits. 
my people"; "Behold, I stand at the door and knock"; "Follow Me"), to which we reply when we authenocally pray. Thus prayer is an act of faith; it is faith articulated, and must always be reducible to "I believe in you." So we see that we need to persist, not because God is hard to reach, but because we are. We need to persist in our efforts to listen, to open and to reply to His call. The Father whom Jesus reveals is one who waits for us to become receptive to His loving, saving, graceful presence. Consequently, that's the way prayer is "answered." Prayer is already an answer (our surrender); but once we do this, God responds, too. We've given Him a chance to, by making ourselves accessible. And what does He give us? Himself! Thus prayer is'our answer, answered! 
That's exactly what Jesus says expli­citly at the end of the passage about "ask, search, knock." He says, "If you, with all your sins, know how to give your children good things, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him.'' Hence 1t is His own Spirit He gives when we answer God's mvitation by our prayer. We receive the same thing in every authentic prayer--God Himself. What more can you ask for? 
Well, what about asking for things? And can it reallr, be prarer when we "pray for others '? We' I tackle these questions next time.

Iranian regime denounces Israel 
ATTENTION ENGINEERS  
'VALUES' 80' /SHERE  
It is proposed that a Conference on Human Values and Professional Re~ponsibility in engin­eenng be held in apnl 1980. Your support is needed now. Problem statement and definition presented by REV· OliVER F WILLIAMS, C·S·C· All engineering students and faculty are invited Tuesday, Feb. 20, 7:30PM Room 303, Engr. Building sponsored by ASME  

1EHRAN, Iran (AP) · Iran's new Islamic government an­nounced yesterday it had expell­ed Israeli officials after eliminat­ing all relations with the Jewish state. 
The announcement by Tehran Radio came as Paletine Libera­tion Organization chief Y asser Arafat met with Iranian leaders. 
He conferred with Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Moslem leader of Iran's anti-shah forces, and said the Iranian revolution had turned the strategic balance in the Middle East "upside down." 
Tehran Radio, reponing on a statement from the foreign Mini­Stry, said support for the Palestin ian people was the main principle of the provisional government's foreign policy. Israel once re­ceived most of its oil from Iran. 
The broadcast said 22 Israeli trade and immi~ration officials and representattves of El AI Airline along with other Israeli technicians were expelled from Iran yesterday. All Iranian government employees in Israel were ordered to return home, the station said. 
Arafat won assurances from Khomeini that Iran will ''turn to the issue of victory over Israel" after the nation consolidates its stength, Tehran Radio reponed. 
The Moslem holy man's secret Islamic .court continued r~unding up offictals of the oia regune and Khomeini aides predicted more executions would take place. 
Tehran Radio said Khomeini's forces were searching for depos­ed Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar, whose 38-day-old gov­ernment was swept asid by Khomeini's forces on Feb. 11. The station denied its previous report that he had been arrested and was awaiting trial. 
Four top generals were executed by a firing squad last week. About 400 figures of the old government are under arrest, sources report. 
'Iran will tum 
. to the issue of victory over Jsrael.' 

Persian press reports said some death sentences had been handed out but that executions 
had been postponed U?~il after  
the end of Arafat' s  vtstt.  No  
details were given.  

Arafat' s Palestine Liberation Organization played a major role in training Ir~nian ~errillas who fought the unpenal troops of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was forced to leave the country last month. The govern­ment he appointed to rule in his absence fell Feb. 11. 
Meanwhile, 794 Americans landed in Frankfurt, West Gee­many, late Sunday in the second 
. day of the four-day evacuation of about 5,000 U.S. citizens from Tehran. Many said they were critical of the mass airlift, but refused to comment on their treatment for fear of endangering the safety of Americans still in Iran. _ The mystery over the fate of deposed Prime Minister Shah-
pour Bakhtiar deepened as state radio denied its own previous report that he had been arrested. The broadcast said efforts were under way to ftnd Bakhtiar, who served as prin_le minister for 38 
. days before betng swept astde by Khomeini. Tehran Radio reponed yestL day that officials of the state-run National Iranian Oil Co. an­nounced that striking employees had returned to work in the Ahwaz, Masjed Soley~an, Gach Saran and Abadan oil fields in · southwestern Iran.

Coonan responded that, ''Farley had a good point in their letter. The problem lies in the fact that ,there is not enough student input into administration decision­making. They articulated our short-range goals into a long­range campaign for student input. We couldn't agree more wtth them; it's been our main point all along." 
In response to Carroll Hall's position that more direct student mput to the administration was . necessary, McKenna replied that input is now ' 'as direct as you can get." 
When asked if an organized protest of some son would be an effective means of affectin~ the administrative positwn, McKenna replied negatively and cited the "ftfteen-mmute rule" as his I?rincipal reason. Te ftfteen-mmute rule, according to McKenna, stems form an inci­dent in 1969 when Father Hesburgh instructed a group of

Prices range from $4.55 for a $7.98 list LP to $9.25 for a $15.98list. · 
For those albums not listed on the posters, catalogues are avail­able. Instructions are provided explaining how to use the cata­logues, and someoe familiar with them will be available to assist anyone having problems finding their selection.

Chinese would strike deeply into Vietnam. 
The United States called for the Chinese to withdraw their forces immediately and said Viet­namese troops should leave Cambodia. In an official explanation to the United Nations, China maintained it launched the attack "to defend the country's borders." It said the Vietnamese had ignored "China's repeated warnings" and had "continually sent armed forces to encroach on Chinese territory.''

O.C as a channel, to change parietals to a hall offense. 
The O.C, at a meeting on Oct. 9, discussed and passed a proposal to redefine parietals as a hall offense in light of the rationale presented by Roem~r. Under the CLC proposal, the rector would have the option to refer a· parietals violation to the hall judicial board. According to present University procedure, the rector may either use his own discretion in dealin~ with a violation, or refer the violator to the Dean of Srudents for disctplinary action. 
The proposal was presented to Fr. john Van Wolvlear, vice president for Srudent Affairs, who issue a statement rejecting the proposal in late November. Van Wolvlear ~[ated that "the present system seems to be workin~ efficiently and j'usdy,'' stressed that any change "might lessen the unportance of parietals." 
The CLC then appealed to University Provost Timothy O'Meara, seeking a more adequate response to their proposal. O'Meara rejected the proposal over Christmas break, commenting, ''I think it is in the best interest of the University that the importance of parietals not be diminished.'' 
As final recourse, the CLC decided to appeal the proposal to Hesburgh. According to McKenna, the CLC ''assumed Hesburgh's views would be consistent with those of Van Wolvlear and O'Meara, but wnated an elaboration of the Administration's rationale behind parietals.'' 
McKenna commented that he was satisfied with Hesburgh's res~;>onse to the CLC's appeal. "That's the end of the road for the partetals proposal," he stated, adding, "I have no plan for another proposal on parietals, and I don't think anyone else on the CLC does either." 
"Essentially, people are dissatisfied .with parietals," McKenna continued. ''This is a reflection of their frustration wtth the roles of srudents at Notre Dame. That's the bigger problem, and that's the problem sruJent governmew is going to ::lt-al with

Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, also at the ceremony, said, "We will fight terrorism with all our resolve and re­sources.'' 
Dubs, 58, was shot to death last Wednesday in a gun battle between police and four terrorists who had kidnapped him in Kabul. He was the fifth U.S. ambassador killed in the line of duty in just over a decade. 
His body was returned to Andrews Air Force Base near Washington on. an Air Force jet dispatched by the president. The flag-draped coffin was greeted by a 19-gun salute, and arnilitary band played "Ruffles and Flour­ishes." 
Vance presented the Secre­tary's Award, the State Depart­ment's highes honor, to Dubs' widow in the slain ambassador's name. Mary Ann Dubs, who held the president's arm during the ceremony, stepped to the micro­phone to thank Vance, but could only say "Mr. Secretary ... ," before breaking down in tears. She added almost inaudibly, using her husband's nickname, "on Spike's behalf, thank you." 
Dubs will be :buried tomorrow in Arlington Naitonal Cemetery. 
Earlier, }1rs. Dubs had made public a letter she sent to the Mghan president saying that

beyond her personal grief over her husband's death, "there is I the larger sense in which his death 1s a tragedy -that he should have died in circum­stances so alien to the idea<; he sought to project in his work." 
Mter Dubs was killed last week, American officials com­plained bitterly that Soviet ad­visers at the scene did nothing to delay the police attact or urge further negotiations despitepleas from American Embassy officers. A strong protest also was filed with the Mghanistan govern­ment. 
Carter was described as "very angry'' over the incident, and Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin was summoned te the State Department for a formal protest of what the department called Soviet inaction ''impos­sible to justify.'' 
The Soviet news agency, Tass, reported Saturday that the Soviet Embassy in Washington had rejected the U.S. view, saying the Soviet advisers "had nothing to do with the decision of the Mghan authorities.'' 
The Soviets have developed close ties with Afghanistan since a coup installed Presideilt Nur Mohammed T araki there last April.

Broten's hat trick just ~~ seconds into the final period lifted the Gophers to within one, but Meredith's power-play tally at ~:24 cushioned the ND lead and served as the eventual game-wmner. 
In fact, Meredith scored the game-winning goal each night, giving him SlX such occurences this season. The junior from Toronto, now tied for second in the WCH.A for goals with 26, has at least scored or assisted in each of Notre Dame's last nine league

MORGANTOWN, WV -Bill Hanzlik scored a game-high 14 points and the Notre Dame defense shut down Lowes Moore as the Irish downed West Virgin­ia 70-54 before a record crowd of 15,118 in Morgantown Saturday night. 
The game was marred by West Virgima students throwing marshmallows and other objects at several points in the contest. 
The Irish after being greeted by a shower of debris jumped out to a 17-9 lead in the first 8 minutes of the game. N.D.'s guards accounted for 11 out of the 17 markers with hot peri­emter sh~ting. 
Mountaineer guard Joe Fryz then tallied 5 consecutive points to bring the home club back to within 3, 19-16 at the 7:38 mark. At this point N.D. hit a cold spell marked by cold-shooting and turnovers--particularly traveling violations. West Virginia scored the fmal 8 points of the opening 20 minutes, capped by a Dana Perno lay-up at the b\lZzer and West Virginia took a 28-25 lead into the lockerroom. Lowes Moore led the home club with 9 points. But Moore, who burned the ACC nets for 40 points last year, was harassed by Hanzlik's defense and the Irish team defense and shot only 4 of 10 in the first-half. 
' ...students throwing marshmellows and others obJ"ects ... ' 

Notre Dame rebounded well on both boards holding a 17-12 edge. The Irish shot only 36 percent while the Mountaineers scored on 42 percent of their attempts. 
However, the Irish spurted to a quick stan in the second half, holding the Mountaineers with­out a field goal for the ftrst 5 1I 2 
Irish epees anticipate 1OOth straight victory 
minutes. The Irish during that span hit 8 of their ftrst 10 shots, using an excellent passing game to fmd the open shot. Orlando 
Woolridge scored on a drive at 
18:06 to make it 31-29 and Digger Phelp' squad never lost the lead from that point. Defensively, Notre Dame utilized various com­binations (2-3, 1-3-1 and matchup zones) to completely baffle the Mountaineers. W.V.U. coach 
Gale Catlett admitted later that hP.. o:ouldn't keep up with the Irish defense. 
''We were confused. Both the players and myself were unable to ftgure the Notre Dame de­
fense," said Catlett. The first-year coach also alluded to bemg outcoached by Phelps in the second half when the Irish with a 5 point lead, and the ball, went to a "motion-of­fense" against the West Virginia zone. With Catlett content to stay in the zone, the Irish capitalized by padding their lead to 51-38 and running the clock down to 6:38. Bill Laimbeer, Rich Branning and Tracy Jackson combined for 14 points during this span as Notre Dame took command. 
Lowes Moore was frustrated repeatedly by the combination detenses and fmally fouled out with 5JL~e~;onds!eft. Moore who _.afterwards said, "I could have scored 40 if I wanted tc,'' left 
with 9 points on a 4-13 shooting

leers edge past Gophers 3-2, 8-7 in weekend series 
by Paul Mullaney Assz'stant Sports Editor 

Minnesota Coach Herb Brooks stated as early as last summer that he felt his Golden Gopher skaters were by far the class of the Western Hockey Association. "We're going to win it all," he insisted. 
But whatever that ''all'' included couldn't have been this past weekend's series with Notre Dame at the Athletic and Convo­cation Center. The surging Irish of Coach Lefty Smith swept the visitors from Minneapolis, winning respective 3-2 and 8-7 thrill~rs on Friday and Saturday evenmgs. 
The crucial sweep, in Notre Dame's fmal regular season series at home, vaulted the Irish into an identical tie with Minnesota for second place in the WCHA. But, more importantly, it moved the Gold and Blue closer to gaining home ice advantage for next month's league playoffs. 
Also, it gave the Irish the upper hand m case of a tie with the Gophers come the season's end. Notre Dame took three of the four contests against Brooks and Company in the season series, includin~ one o£ the two games played m Minneapolis. All of which left Smith smiling at the conclusion of Saturday's game. 
"Ifthere's anything that really pleases me about the weekend,'' offered the Irish mentor, ''it's the fact that for the second week in a row we faced a team higher than us in the standings and we beat 'em. 
"To do that two weeks in a row, winning both nights, is a tremendous accomplishment.'' 
The Irish swept Minnesota­Duluth on foreign ice last week­end while UMD was ranked third nationally. The double triumph over the Gophers, ranked second this past week, now gives Notre Dame five straight wins, equalling its longest streak of the year. It also marked the ftrst time in Irish annals that they swept the Gophers in South Bend. 
Nevertheless, the Irish looked like the Notre Dame squad that caused many a head to turn at the season's outset, when the young squad took an early posinon at the top of the league, let alone an envied spot at the top of the national poll. 
"It was a total effort on everyone's part,'' enthused Smith of the latest Notre Dame wins. "We gave up a few too many goals Saturday night, but the fact that we won sort of pushes that to the side. We just hope to keep our momentum gomg this weekend when we play Denver." 
If the Irish will indeed keep up the momentum, they'11 need the continued consistency of fresh­man goalie, Dave Laurion. The veteran-looking rookie was particularly amazing on Friday, while stopping all but two of Minnesota's 32 goal-bound shots. 
In fact, after Neal Broten and Steve Christoff put the Gophers into a 2-0 lead midway through Friday's initial period, Laurion refused to budge the rest of the way. 
The problem for the Irish, however, was that Minnesota's Steve Janaszak was equally up to the task. The senior stalwart, one of the best glove goalies in the WCHA, had shut out the Irish halfway through the contest. That's when Notre Dame decided

While Notre Dame's fencing team couldn't take this past Saturday for granted, its members had to be thinking ahead to this coming weekend, when the two-time defending national champions will attempt. to reach the magical mark of 100 straight wins. 
The lon~est streak in collegiate fencing history is now up to 95 straight after the Irish disposed ofPenn State (17-10), Ohio State (16-11) and Michigan State.(19-8) Saturday at Columbus, Ohio. 
The fencers of Mike DeCicco have long been awaiting this week, however. The Irish host seven schools at St. Mary's }. 'lgela Athletic Facility, . including Wayne State, a perennial contender for the national t~tle. Wisconsin and Illinois also are among the schools that will try to abruptly halt the streaking swordsmen.

ftve fewer touches to offset a led by Flowers' 8 caroms, hold a deadlock of eight bouts apiece. 33-21 edge. The Irish women defeated N01ES: Hanzlik's 14 point Michigan State, 11-5, leaving effort, marked the ftrst time the their overall record at 7-2. [continued on page 11]
