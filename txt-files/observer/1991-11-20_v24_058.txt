WASHINGTON (AP) -The !louse on Tuesday sustained President Bush's veto earlier in the day of a bill that would have lifted his ban of federally financed abortion counseling. Democrats had thought they had the muscle to override Bush for the first time, but fell a dozen votes short. 
The outcome left Bush with a perfect 24-0 record for making his vetoes stiek, and was a blow to House Speaker Thomas Fo­ley, 1>-Wash., who convened the override debate immediately after the president's action with a prediction that "We have the , votes" on the hotly disputed abortion issue. 
But Foley didn't; the 276-156 tally was a dozen short of the two-thirds necessary. 
Foley, in a rare speech on the House floor, condemned the veto as motivated by "a mis­taken principle." 
At stake was an overall $205 billion spending bill for educa­tion, labor and health pro­grams. But the fight was cen­tered on a provision that would block for one year the Bush administration's rule banning abortion counseling at federally supported family planning clin­ics. 
That provision has been at­tacked as a "gag rule" by critics who say it shackles doctors and prevents pregnant women from obtaining information pertinent to their right of choice. 
Supporters did not have the two-thirds override strength in the last House vote on the mea-

sure, either -when it was ap­proved 272-156. 
The bill had cleared the Sen­ate 72-25, more than the two­thirds veto-proof majority, earlier this month. 
"The president ought to feel pretty good about this," said Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn., a leading anti-abortion lawmaker. "This was an issue where it was very hard for us to demand party loyalty.... This was a tough one." 
Fifty-three Republicans and one independent joined 222 Democrats in voting to override the president. Forty-three Democrats voted with 113 Re­publicans to sustain. 
"What happened was the White House worked very, very hard," said Rep. Steny Hoyer, D­Md., chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. "I think the president loses on this. I don't think the American public agrees with him." 
In vetoing the bill, Bush con­tended he was not trying to re­strict counseling for pregnant women. 
He pointed to a memo he sent to Louis Sullivan, the secretary of Health and Human Services, which he said "makes clear that there is no 'gag rulo' to in­terfere with the doctor-patient relationship. I have directed that in implementing these reg­ulations, nothing prevents a woman from receiving complete medical information about her condition from a physician." 
Democrats denounced Bush's veto in strong terms aud said that in vetoing the measure, Bush was jeopardizing the bill's spending for major health and education programs. Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., called the veto

Renovation of the Church of Loretto at Saint Mary's is im­minent, despite opposition from many in the Saint Mary's com­munity, according to Mary Turgi, chairperson of the reno­vation committee. 
Turgi discussed the reasons behind the decision at an open forum held yesterday at Saint Mary's. 
Renovations have been dis­cussed for at least eight years, but until last September, there has been no real planning. The committee spent three to four months finding an architect be­fore deciding on Evans Wooller, the same architect who de­signed Saint Mary's Cushwa­Leighton Library. 
One reason behind the deci­sion was that the committee thought that there are many structural defects in the church, according to Turgi. 
The acoustics and lighting are believed to be inadequate, she said. Because of the high, concave architecture, sounds tend to bounce around, making it hard for others to hear the service. 

The walls of the church will be altered to better the acous­tics, according to Turgi. Presently, the walls of the church slope down to niches, into which various statues are placed. The walls above the niches are composed of colored tile mosaics, depicting various scenes from the Bible. 
Wooller decided that the first fifteen feet of the walls should be removed, taking off only mosaics of palm trees while leaving the pictures intact. The niches would be removed under the architect's plan and the re­sulting wall area made convex, to counteract the acoustics. 
Wooller believes that the ren­ovations will cause a fifty per­cent improvement in the acous­tics.

"ND family" isn't as great as it sounds 
As the time for turkey------­

and gift giving approaches  
none  too  quickly  for  
overworked  students,  
thoughts  of  family  
holidays  past  keep  
popping into mind. No  
where  are  thoughts of  
"family" more prevalent  Lisa Eaton  
than at Notre Dame. At  
the very core of the whole  Managing Editor  
Notre Dame mystic is the  

idea of the "Notre Dame family." 
This is a concept diligently promoted by ND representatives across the country as they attempt lure prospective students to life under the Golden Dome. They speak of how dorm life encourages a sense of family, how everybody at Notre Dame is just one big happy family and how the administration is going to be there to shoulder the parental role for the new students. 
In theory, there is nothing really wrong with this idea. Almost everybody has a positive concept of families and it is natural to want to have the comfort and safety of home come along to college. The real problem with this idea lies in its practice and application. 
There is en loco parentis, that gem of administrative policy giving good ole' Monk and his cohorts the authority to act as mom and dad away from home. 
To the average high school senior and his/her parents, this is undoubtedly a very reassuring and attractive concept. But who really needs a second set of parents? 
In reality the university, although good intentioned, does not allow its adult students the freedom to make their own decisions about important issues, such as sexuality and alcohol. Parietals and an alcohol policy, in some form, are necessary for the general safety of the students, but it currently encourages "closet" behaviors and uninformed choices. The university is not winning any "Parent of the Year" awards for that. 

Notre Dame proudly boast about the fact that there are only single sex dorms with limited visitation hours on its campus. Why doesn't Notre Dame have co-ed dorms or · extended visitation hours? Does the Admin­istration think that campus is going to become a orgy factory? Or does it simply not have enough confidence in its students to give them some credit for wanting to live and behave like adults in a dormitory situation? Do students have to move off-campus to prove that they can handle having neighbors of the opposite sex? 
"Parental concern" and "administrative concern" should be two mutually exclusive ideas. The whole point of going away to college is to learn how to fly solo in the face of difficult decisions. To replace one set of parents with another is defeating the purpose and inhibiting the growth of the student. 
The "Notre Dame family" is a very inviting one, but it is not without its price. As it cur­rently functions, the price seems to be the students' freedom to choose how to live their lives. Maybe one day, the administration will realize that this isn't Never-Never Land and sooner or later everybody has to grow up.

hostage drama gave new indi­cations that the remaining Westerners held in Lebanon could soon be released as well. 
A day after pro-Iranian Shiite Muslim captors freed Waite, 52, and Sutherland, 60, Iran said the kidnappers would soon free the last three American captives and "close this case." 
At the United Nations, Secre­tary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar -who had said Mon­day that there was an agree­ment in principle to free the Western captives by Christmas -said Tuesday that such a re­hlase would be unconditional. 
The secretary-general has been trying for months to bro­ker a complex overall swap that would also involve missing Israeli servicemen in Lebanon and Arab detainees held by Is­rael and its allied militia in south Lebanon. Tuesday marked the first time he had suggested that the Westerners could be freed even if all the pieces of the complex puzzle do not fall into place. 
At a rain-swept air base in western England, Waite, the bear-like Church of England envoy kidnapped nearly five years ago during a mission to free the other hostages, had an emotional homecoming. 
Waite criticized all who hold prisoners in the Middle East, no matter what the reason. "Those who do it fall well below civilized standards of behavior, no matter who they are," he said in impassioned tones. 
While Waite was eloquent in his appeal for the release of 

Both Sutherland and Waite appeared to revel in the ordi­nary things denied them so long in captivity. 
Arriving at Wiesbaden early Tuesday, Sutherland was given a bouquet and deeply inhaled the scent. "I haven't seen flow­ers in 6 1/2 years," he said. 
In Tehran, official Iranian radio declared: "The rest of the three remaining American hostages will be freed soon." 
The commentary, monitored in Cyprus, praised the efforts of Perez de Cuellar, whose inten­sive mediation effort began in August. 
Lebanon's state television said Tuesday the three remaining American hostages would be released soon even if Israel failed to free more Arab pris­oners. The television cited an unidentified U.N. source. 
"There are assurances that the case of the remaining American hostages would be closed soon despite the lack of any sign of reciprocation from Israel," the station said. 
Both Waite and Sutherland had said Monday that their captors told them the three re­maining Americans -Terry Anderson, Joseph Cicippio and Alann Steen -would soon be released. 
Waite said the kidnappers told him Cicippio and Steen would be freed within a few days, and Anderson would be released by the end of the month. Sutherland said "in about a couple of weeks, all of the Americans will be freed, hopefully." 
Anderson, 44, chief Middle East correspondent for The As­sociated Press, was kidnapped March 16, 1985 and is the longest held of the hostages. Cicippio, 61, of Norristown, Pa., was kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986, and Steen, 52, of Boston, was abducted on Jan. 24, 1987.

Keeping track of $70 million, handling 1,200 employees, and working alongside city council is all in a day's work for Katie Humphrey, she said. 
A'i South Bend city controller, Humphrey is in charge of all of the city's finances, she said in her lecture at Saint Mary's last night. The $70 million for which she is responsible include property tax revenues, enterprise tax funds, state excise taxes, as well as other taxes. 

In her department there are approximately 1,200 full time employees including police otli­cers, firemen, teamster employ­ees, secretaries, sanitation workers, and other part-time employees, she said. 
Humphrey said that she works closely with the city council and Mayor Joe Kernan in managing the budget. Some of her projects have included restoring a $1.6 million budget cut, restructuring the city's budget, and reducing health in­surance costs, she explained. 
Humphrey added that her job is challenging and interesting

In Israel, officials sought"io ensure that their missing ser­vicemen remained part of any hostage-freeing deal. Israel's foreign minister, David Levy, urged mediators "to act without any discrimination until ev­eryone is released, including our prisoners." 
LYNEHAM, England (AP) ­Laughing and without a trace of bitterness, freed hostage Terry Waite returned home Tuesday and pledged to keep working to release all hostages in Lebanon. 
The burly envoy, who paid for his last mercy mission to Le­banon with five years in captiv­ity, joked about his large feet and the English weather. And he spoke with quiet and con­trolled emotion of nearly five years in captivity. 
The period, he said, included four years in solitary confine­ment, in a windowless room without books or notepaper. He spoke to no one except an occa­sional word with a guard who brought food. 
"I think you can imagine that after 1,763 days in chains it is an overwhelming experience to come back and receive your greetings," said Waite, 52, after flying into this air base in gusting winds and pouring rain. 
"From the bottom of my heart, thank you for turning out on such an awful day, but a typically English day," he said, looking gaunt, but walking steadily. 
Waite, 52, stepped from the air force plane which flew him home via Cyprus and spoke for nearly 15 minutes to well-wish­ers sheltered from the rain in a hangar. He was then reunited with his wife and four children. 
The 6-foot-7-inch Waite was freed Monday in Beirut along with American Thomas Suther­land.

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -The United States Tuesday forced home 300 Haitians who fled in small boats after a mili­tary coup. But as Haitians kept fleeing, a U.S. judge ordered the government to stop the repatriation. 
A U.S. Coast Guard cutter had picked up the 300 Haitians after the Sept. 30 coup and de­tained them aboard while the Bush administration weighed ~hat steps to take. On Monday, It moved to return them to the impoverished Caribbean coun­try. 
About 20 policemen looked on while immigration officials processed the returning Haitians, who had risked their lives to flee, many in frail ves­sels. Red Cross officials said they would examine the refugees and give them $10 each before they rejoined their families. 
The Haitians filled a green­ceilinged welcoming area at the industrial docks. Many sat list­lessly, arms folded on their knees, and others lined up for officials at tables. One man on line wore a shirt that said "Tahiti." 
Said one refugee, who spoke on condition of anonymity: ''I've tried to le-ave before. Every time I do, they catch me. I'm not going to try again." 
In Washington, State De­partment deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said the refugees continued leaving Haiti despite the U.S. decision Monday to return them. The Coast Guard has picked up a total of 2,160 since the coup, he said. 
Hours after the first group were returned, U.S. District Judge Donald Graham in Miami temporarily halted the repatri­ation until another hearing Monday.

Haitians by the droves, many fearing repression, have been fleeing after President Jean­Bertrand Aristide, their first democratically elected presi­dent, was toppled by the mili­tary. Many were retrieved by Coast Guard cutters stationed not far from Haiti's coast. 
Nearly 500 are in U.S. cus­tody at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba and the rest are aboard Coast Guard cutters. Venezuela Belize, Honduras and Trinidad and Tobago had offered to take in at least 550 of the Haitians and U.S. officials said thos~ held at Guantanamo Bay will be sent to those countries first. 
After failing to persuade countries in the area to provide shelter for more Haitians, the State Department announced in Washington that most of the Haitians were being sent home, effective immediately.

Shevardnaze to return as foreign minister 
MOSCOW (AP) -Eduard Shevardnadze is returning as Soviet foreign minister, officials announced Tuesday, giving an immediate boost to his long­time friend Mikhail Gorbachev's struggle to revive Kremlin authority. 
The reappointment of She­vardnadze, who helped end the Cold War but then quit as for­eign minister last December, warning of dictatorship in the Kremlin, drew immediate praise from President Bush and other Western leaders. 
"We know him well and have great respect for him," Bush told reporters as he met in the White House with Alexander Yakovlev, another member of the original Gorbachev team that began the perestroika re­forms. 
The genial, white-haired She­vardnadze, 63, and other Soviet leaders had no immediate pub­lic comment on the appoint­mont, but state TV called it "just as sensational" as his resignation 11 months ago. 
The appointment bolstered world confidence in Gorbachev as he struggled to forge a new confederation among the re­maining 12 Soviet republics and persuade them to assume re­sponsibility for the $81 billion Soviet debt. 
"In a particularly difficult moment for the U.S.S.R., the return of Shevardnadze ... will contribute to giving the world a guarantee of having in Moscow not only secure, but also trust­worthy and capable partners in dialogue," Italian Foreign Min­ister Gianni De Michelis said. 
The reappointment was the latest turn in a remarkable life. Shevardnadze had made a ca­reer in the Communist Party and police apparatus in his na­tive Georgia until Gorbachev surprised the world by naming him foreign minister in 1985. 
As Gorbachev's chief emissary to the West, Shevardnadze hammered· out treaties under which the Soviet Union slashed its nuclear and conventional arsenals and agreed to with­draw its armies from eastern Europe. Soviet satellite regimes and the Berlin Wall toppled, en­raging hard-liners. 
Shevardnadze, with a theatri­cal flair, stunned the world last Dec. 20 by telling the Soviet parliament he was resigning because "dictatorship" stalked the Kremlin. 
Less than a month later, So­viet troops cracked down on secessionist Lithuania and Latvia, killing more than 20 people. Last August, Shevard­nadze's chilling prophesy came true, as Communist Party hard­liners tried to overthrow Gor­bachev.

New portions of Dea~d Sea Scrolls published 


NEW YORK (AP) -Three American experts Tuesday an­no~.mced publication of previ­ously unpublished portions of the Dead Sea Scrolls, further breaking a small group of re­searchers' 40-year stranglehold on the documents. 
Access to the scrolls has been guarded jealously by an eight­member committee of Israel­based researchers dubbed "the cartel" by critics. 
In recent months, two Ameri­can institutions published por­tions of the scrolls in defiance of the committee. 
Tuesday's announcement of publication of "A facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls," a two-volume set, takes the academic revolt a major step further by offering the 20 percent of scroll material never before seen, in addition to what was published but not readily available to all scholars. 
"This represents the last stage in the breaking of the monopoly. Now there will be absolute, total public access," said Professor Robert Eisen­man, chairman of religious studies at California State Uni­versity in Long Beach and co­editor of the book. 
Hershel Shanks, publications editor for the Washington, D.C.­based Biblical Archeology Society that is publishing the book, also announced a new In­stitute for Dead Sea Scr.olls Studies, where scholars may study the manuscripts and ex­change information. 
The scrolls were discovered in caves near the Dead Sea in 1947. Scholars believe they were written by members of a Jewish sect around the time of Jesus. 
While some 300 scrolls have

"What enormous hubris and greed it was fot eight men to think that in their lifetime they could edit and write commen­taries on all of this material," said Shanks, a leading foe of the committee. 
Eisenman said the 1,787 pho­tographs of scrolls in the new books were delivered to him over a two-year period by an anonymous source. 
He said he didn't know who thA sourr.P. was. hut believed it was no one connected with the Israel committee or with either of the institutions that recently released material, the Hurfting­ton Library in San Marino, Calif., and Hebrew Union Col­lege in Cincinnati. 

Professor Eugene Ulrich of Notre Dame University, a committee editor who denies that the group has withheld data unfairly, called the Eisen­man-Robinson book "grandstanding" and "ethically questionable." 
Ulrich added, however: "I would hope this will bring some peace and rest to the troubled waters of the Dead Sea Scrolls project ... I would like to see (Shanks) and his colleagues de­cide they've gotten enough ku­dos that they can get out of the warfare mentality." 
Eisenman and his co-editor, Professor James Robinson, chairman of religion at Califor­nia's Claremont College gradu­ate school, said they had no doubt that the anonymously donated photographs were au­thentic.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Win or lose, a visit to ND is a moment to remembe1r 

Dear Editor: 
To lose by 10 points hurts. To lose by 1 point hurts even more. Why do so many fans seek tickets to an Irish game when they can watch it from the comfort of their living rooms and avoid the traffic? Because you really haven't seen the Irish spirit until you've been to the ND stadium, live. 
To get the true aspect of the game, one need to fight the Friday night traffic to attend the pep rally. If the traffic doesn't get the blood pumping, the rally will. 
Don't miss the tailgate party, or the walk along US 33-where you'll see visitors from as far away as California toting signs "in hopes" of purchasing tickets-at any price. 
Sure, ND wants to win-but if they don't-nobody walks away a loser. For they have purchased a ticket to a memory that will live on in their hearts forever! There are no sad faces with exception of a brief look of defeat upon those of the players. But once the cameras are gone, the grief is too, for the Irish spirit is something that cannot be defeated, no matter what the score.

Limiting films will only promote censorship 
Dear Editor: 
I was amazed to see Professor Rice's editorial about "Madonna: Truth or Dare" (The Observer, Nov. 12). In simple terms, he was advocating a form of cen­sorship. This, from a professor in our Law School who is sup­posed to be teaching his stu­dents the value of the First Amendment. 
From the way he wrote his editorial, I do not find any evi­dence that he has even seen the film. All he does is quote other writers that reviewed the film when it was released. If he had not seen the film before writing about it, and even if he has, he is wrong to advocate censorship. 
The film in question did con­tain some explicit material, but that is why it received the rating it did. The students and faculty at this University are mature enough to see the film. For those who were not open­minded enough to see the mm. it did have some merit to it, both as an art film and as a documentary. 
Granted, it was more than enough Madonna to satisfy me until I die, but it was interesting. It was valuable as an artistic film, because the director used some very interesting techniques to visually express the persona of Madonna. As a documentary, it gave insight into one of the most interesting characters of popular culture. 

This type of insight is valuable to understand why she is so popular and why she is doing what she does. As an artist, she wants to push the limits of self-expression. In America, she has that right, and a university in South Bend should not have the power to deny this right. 
When Professor Rice wrote about the choice of films at the Snite, his statements angered me even more. The Last Temptation of Christ, by most standards, could be considered blasphemous, if taken literally. This film, like most other art, should not be interpreted literally. If one views the film with an understanding that it is not an actual portrayal of the adult life of Jesus, one will gain an interesting view of the human­ity of Jesus. 
View it for the ideas, not the story. I thought it did a remarkable job to show the humanity of Jesus while it portrayed the divinity as well. 
Professor Rice, and anyone else who agrees with him, the Snite. does not need "fumigation" or "demonstration." The films that Rice has a problem with are intended for an open­minded adult. If he does not want to see them, he does not have to. That is the beauty of America. People have the right to choose what to see, to hear, and to speak. This right should not be infringed upon by anyone, let alone a university. 
The purpose of a university is to expose its students to new ideas and new ways of expres­sion. To advocate censorship at the University of Notre Dame is wrong and goes against this fundamental purpose of a university. 
Rice also makes an interesting point about the fact that ND is a "Catholic" university. What people need to remember is the original meaning of this word. "Catholic" means "universal." I'm not advocating the idea that ND move away from pro­moting Roman Catholic ideals, but it needs to promote universal ideas as well. 
Professor Rice also should remember that the best law school in the nation sponsors an X-rated film festival every year. Yale believes in the First Amendment. I hope Notre Dame will continue to believe in it as well.

LE II ERS TO THE EDITOR 
Papal teachings proscribe the ordination of women 
Dear Editor: 
The Observer of Oct. 15 re­counted what has become an annual Notre Dame rite-a statement by the Committee on Notre Dame's Position on the 
r 
Ordination of Women ,r (CNDPOW). "How come," said a spokesman for CNDPOW, "we r (Notre Dame) can certify just
r 
r about every calling and profes­sion (for women) and we will
r 
fight like blazes to stand by our
r 
certification, but we won't do it 
r with women and the priest­hood?" The answer, shortly, is that a vocation to the priest­hood is a call from Christ acting ~ through his mystical body, the Catholic Church. Notre Dame is neither Christ nor the Church. 
Notre Dame does present it­self, especially to alumni and others, as a Catholic university. Yet Notre Dame, by its own r choice, is legally a secular cor­r poration. If Notre Dame is r secular and not Catholic, why r should anyone care what its r position is on the ordination' of 
r 
r 
women, any more than one should care about the position on the subject of General Motors or the Kiwanis Club? 
If, however, Notre Dame is Catholic, as it claimS" to be and as CNDPOW claims it to be, that identity carries with it an obligation of institutional fi­delity to the clear position of the Catholic Church, as enunciated by the Vicar of Christ. 
The periodic CNDPOW state­ments convey the impression that the issue of ordination of women is an open, politicized one of civil rights. Unfortunately, Notre Dame students are not likely to have had the opportunity in their theological studies to experi­ence an adequate presentation of the Papal teaching on this, or any other, subject. In fact, the position of the Church on the ordination of women is clear and settled. 
In his address to the American bishops, in Los Angeles on Sept. 16, 1987, Pope John Paul II stated that, "women are not called to the pries.thood. Although the teaching of the Church on this point is quite clear, it in no way alters the fact that women are indeed an essential part of the Gospel plan to spread the Good News of the kingdom. And the Church is irrevocably commit­ted to this truth." (Emphasis in original) 
On Jan. 30 1977, Pope Paul VI said, "Why can men alone and not women, too, receive the priesthood? Let us note straight off that disparity of function does not imply unequal dignity in the objective order of grace nor, consequently, any in­feriority in the order of love and holiness (Gal 3, 28). In this hierarchy, as Mary shows, women can occupy the highest places and this not merely as passive recipients of grace but as active practitioners of the great virtues which have such a wide and beneficent influence on society. 
The reason for the disparity of function is Christ's decision in giving the Church her fundamental structure and her theological anthropology. The perennial tradition of the Church reflects that original determination . . . . Moreover, now that an answer has been given to this question, which some intemperate feminists have rendered unnecessarily vexing, We urge women to real­ize that the Church has no in­tention of underestimating the 
. precious role they are called to play in the overall plan of God's k;ingdom and in the temporal sphere as well." Three months earlier, on Oct. 15, 1976, Pope Paul VI had ap­proved and ordered the pro­mulgation of the Declaration on the Ordination of Women, by 


the Congregation for the 
Doctrine of the Faith. The 
Declaration stated that, 
"complying with a mandate of 
the Holy Father and adhering to 
what he himself wrote in his 
Letter of Nov. 30, 1975, [the 
Congregation] believes it neces­
sary to assert that the Church, 
which intends to be faithful to 
the Lord's example, does not 
regard herself as having the 
authority to admit women to 
priestly ordination . . . . The 
Catholic Church has never held 
the view that prieStly or episco­
pal ordination can be validly 
conferred upon women." 
In a passage that ought to be required reading for CNDPOW members, the Declaration stated, "In the last analysis, it is for the Church to speak through the magisterium on these matters and to determine which elements of the sacraments are immutable and which are mutable. The Church is convinced that she may not admit certain changes because she knows that Christ has bound her to act in a certain way . . . . The Church's practice thus has normative value for her. Behind her practice of conferring priestly ordination only on males lies a tradition 


coterminous with the history of the Church, universal through­out east and west, and ever watchful in order quickly to suppress abuses. 
Such a norm, based on the example of Christ, has been followed in the past and is being followed today because it is regarded as conformed to God's plan for his Church." 
"It is necessary," said the Declaration, "to keep before our minds how much the Church differs from other societies and how utterly unique her nature and structure are . . . . Moreover, and especially, one would seriously mistake the nature of ministerial priesthood were one to account it as a right all human beings have; baptism does not give anyone a right to exercise a public ministry in the Church. 
Priesthood is conferred upon a person, not for his honor or personal advantage but for the service of God and the Church. It is the object of a special and completely unmerited call: 'It was not you who chose me; it was I who chose you' (Jn 15, 16; see Heb 5, 4) It is said at times, and frequently repeated in books and periodicals, that there are women who feel themselves called to the priest­hood. 
Such an inclination, however, though noble and quite understandable, is not enough to prove a genuine vocation; a vocation is not reducible to a simple interior inclination, which of itself is purely subjective. Since priesthood is a special ministry of which the Church has charge and control, a vocation also requires authentication by the Church as a constitutive element, for Christ chose 'the men he himself had decided on' (Mk 3, 13). 
On the other hand, all the baptized do have a call to exercise the royal priesthood by offering their lives to God and bearing witness so that God is praised. Women who say they seek the ministerial priesthood are undoubtedly impelled by the desire to serve Christ and the Chur"ch. 
Nor is it surprising that, having once become fully aware of the discrimination to which they have been subjected in the past in the civil sphere, they should desire the ministerial priesthood. We must not overlook, however, the fact that the priesthood is not something to which the human person has an inherent right but depends on the working out of the mys­tery of Christ and his Church." 
The teaching of the Church is firm on this issue. And it is ev­ident that John Paul II repre­sents the wave of the future for the Church. His appeal to youth throughout the world is magnetic and increasing. The post-Vatican II decline in voca­tions is turning around for re­ligious congregations, male and female, loyal to the Pope. 
The same trend can be seen in some dioceses where the emphasis is on fidelity to prayer, the sacraments and the teachings of the Vicar of Christ. On the other hand, the adherents of the "Church-of­where-it's-at" are fading leftovers of the sixties. They see the Church in political terms and they would manipulate it as they would a political movement or the Congress. 
The Catholic Church, however, is not like that. Instead of playing pressure group politics with the Church, the members of CNDPOW would do better to encourage the members of the Notre Dame community to pray, especially the Rosary, for increased vocations to the priesthood and the religious life. And it is about time for the Holy Cross priests at Notre Dame to speak out in support of the Papal teachings on this and other points.

Campus organizations launching awareness campaign 
Dear Editor: 
A coalition of campus organi­zations will launch a campaign to raise awareness about sexual harassment and sexual assault at Notre Dame. We recognize the need for such a program in order to raise awareness about these problems. We hope that by sponsoring such a program the number of such incidences will decrease. 
The campaign includes several Observer ads explaining the myths and realities of sexual harassment and sexual assault. We hope to dispel some commonly held misconceptions through these ads. 
Besides the series of ads, a letter will be sent to each stu­dent from a victim or from a person related to a victim. There will also be a panel dis­cussion headed by Ms. Laurel Eslinger of Sex Offense Services on Wednesday, Dec. 4, at 7 p.m. in the Library Auditorium. We hope that this will provide students an opportunity to voice their concerns, questions, and opinions. 
The campaign will culminate in a tvyo-page article in which we hope to illustrate specific incidences of sexual harass­ment and assault here at Notre Dame. Foremost, we are ask­ing that if you or someone you know has had an experience of harassment or assault to write anonymously to Student Government. Such letters will be vital to the campaign and will be considered confidential. 
The address for letters is: Student Government, 2nd Floor LaFortmie.

John O'Brien Rockne's Lovechild 
If you got the money, we got the room 
I 
read with great interest the whole saga that took place during the men's interhall 
 football playfoffs. Cit's a rehaldshamehthat 
the Vermin rom arro11 a to 6g t so 
gallantly, only to have their victory taken 
away from them. 
But as I read about how Carroll was forced to 
forfeit a game because three of their players 
were ineligible, I wasn't thinking that Carroll 
had cheated or that the interhall officials had 
made a mistake. 
The thing that struck me about the whole mess was that two of those players who live in Carroll don't even go to Notre Dame. There are quite a few students from Holy Cross College that live in the apartments around me, and they're all great people. "Why, then, don't they live at Notre Dame?" I wondered aloud. 
The question was answered when I realized 
who these two players are. It all seems to fit 
now. If you have the clout (or more importantly, 
the money) you can get anything you want at 
Notre Dame. 
I have this friend named Matt. He's from 
about the same financial background as my­
self-modest by Notre Dame's standards. Well, 
Matt, you see, transferred to Notre Dame last 
year. Hoping to live on campus, he contacted the 
Office of Student Residences. 
"Sorry, there's no room in the Inn," they said, 
to quote that Book we know so well. 
Hmm ... if there was indeed no room on 
campus for Notre Dame students, how come 
there are two (and maybe more) Holy Cross 
students living here? 
In the words of a representative from Student Hesidences, "Special exceptions were made by the Officers of the University." Hmm... 
In an Observer EXCLUSIVE! I have discovered 
the guidelines the Officers of the University use 
for making these " special exceptions." 
First, a $100,000 donation will allow you to take all the food out of the dining halls that you'd like-get this-including Yo-Cream! 
A $500,000 donation will allow you and all your roommates to carry liquor across campus in-get this-unsuitable packaging! 
For a cool million, you can have either the Irish women's volleyball team or the men's hoops squad come over and give you a rub down-nightly. 
If you donate enough to build, say, a new dorm, you get any room on campus you want! Okay, so that's a little far-fetched. Sorry. 
If you donate enough for two dorms, you not only get a room, but cable television, too. 
If you give the University enough to create a new quad, high-ranking University officials will baby-sit your grandchildren. . 
Lou lloltz will personally wean them and Monk will teach them how to play basketball. Throw in another building, and Patricia O'Hara will handle the discipline. 
Looking at all of these guidelines, it's apparent that people like Matt and I don't really have the bucks to get what we want at ND. 
I, for one, would like cable, but two dorms are a little out of my parents' reach. I do think they could help me on one thing, though. 
Like most Arts and Letters students, I need classes. In fact, English 300A looks good, but it's closed. 
1\s I look at the guidelines, I see that there are no provisions for "exceptions" for classes. So I've looked around campus and found some­thing that my parents can afford: One of those brick things they have on Fieldhouse Mall. 
Okay, how much can a brick platform with a plaque on it cost? A couple thousand tops. Surely Mom and Pops could chalk that up. Well, at least they would if they loved me.

Home for Christmas CD features local celebrities to benefit youth fund 

By JOHN RYAN Accent Writer 
It's Christmas season once again, and the students at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's are beginning to feel the excitement and bustle that sur­rounds the holiday season. If you're searching for the perfect gift for the family or friends, search no further. The ultimate Christmas album is here on compact disc: Acorn Records' "Home For Christmas." 

The recording was actually the easiest part, thanks to the cooperation of the performers. Arranging the publicity, marketing, financing, and the manufacturing of the disc presented the largest obstacles, making the project "an arduous process for sure," according to Oake. 
The performers on "Home For Christmas" range from Lou Holtz, the Notre Dame head football coach, to Big Daddy TC from the radio 
"Home For------------station Jam 910 Christmas" is a 'Christmas is the time a.m. Many local special charity f · · d p e r f o r m e r s

contributed their time and efforts to help the production of the holiday disc. 
The album was the brainchild of Cyril Oake, who is the producer for Acorn Records. An Ind. native, Oake lived and taqght in the projects of Brooklyn, N.Y., for several years before returning to Ind. a year ago. "I saw the same street violence going on here that reminded me of Brooklyn," said Oake. 
Through meetings with Charles Martin of the YMCA, Oake came up with the idea for the disc. Although the production dido 't begin until August, Acorn "decided to go through with it even though it was a late start," Oake commented. 

waived all rights 
and did not ask for compensation for their time. "Most were pretty excited just to get the exposure," said Oake. 
A wide variety of music styles appear on the benefit disc, so that it may have a more uo.iversal appeaL "Go Santa Go," performed by the Alter Egos, is a throwback to the Buddy Holly days of the Fifties. A touch of soul and R&B is added to selections such as "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas," and the Bushwacker Band performs "If Santa Claus Don't Come Tonight" with a little country flavor. A humorous rendition of "The Twelve Days of Christmas" was put together With the help of many of the local radio and television personalities. 
Acorn records also tapped into the talents of Notre Dame for the holiday disc. The Notre Dame Glee Club sings "Ave Maria," and a group of students and faculty performs the Irish classic "Seamaisin" with a Gaelic passage read by Michael McGettrick. 
The main attraction to the disc may be Lou Holtz's recitation of "The Night Before Christmas." Oake believes Holtz, perhaps the most well known celebrity on the disc, will help sell more copies. 
Oake is already planning to produce a "Home For Christmas II" for next year, and he hopes to draw some more Hoosier celebrities such as David Letterman, Jane Pauley, and maybe even Larry Bird. This would give the benefit disc a stronger national impact. . 
"Home For Christmas," although comprised of local performers, is being distributed nationally through Vinyl Vendors, and is being adver­tised through publications such as "Blue and Gold." It can be purchased by telephone (800-678-NUTS) with a Visa or Mastercard. 
When planning your Christmas shopping this season, keep in mind "Home For Christmas." It will provide hours of holiday entertainment, and the money spent will help the disadvantaged youth in the area go to college. As South Bend mayor Joe Kernan says in the album's introduction, "Christmas is the time of giving, and certainly there is no greater gift than that of

Good things 


from the 
BoDeans 


By Rich Kurz and Jen Marten Accent Writers 
Even though only two acts were listed on the bill ofperformers, four separate sounds filled Stepan Center last night. 
After opening act Will T. Massey warmed up two-thirds full Stepan, the BoDeans took the stage and treated the crowd to three distinctly different sounds. 
The group opened with a number of songs from their first few albums, "Love & Hope & Sex & Dreams," and "Outside Looking In," belying their origins in the Milwaukee bar scene. 
After opening with "Fadeway," the group switched gears playing the mellower "Dreams," before encouraging crowd participation on "If I Could Hold You Tonight." 
"Paradise," the first song performed. off their most recent album, "Black and White," sent a wave of energy through the crowd, and for the rest of the evening the band received a great deal of support from the audience. This song featured a more poppish feel, emphasizing Michael Ramos' keyboards. 
Vocalists Sammy Llanas and Kurt Neumann shared responsibilities on the mike, complementing each other nicely. Llanas' deep-throated, gravelly voice contrasted Neumann's more melodic sound. Despite apologies for Llanas' vocal problems, his unique sound disguised whatever trouble he may have had. 
"Good Things," a song which has encountered some success on the pop charts, proved to be one of the big hits of the first set, with the crowd filling in the responses on a couple of occasions. The group finished the first set with "Ultimately Fine," from the "Love & Hope" album. 
Ramos, bassist Bobby Griffin and drummer Danny Gayol took a break, leaving Llanas and Neumann alone on stage. The pair showed yet another side, performing a three-song acoustic set harkening back to their first sound. 
The rest of the band returned for a rocking cross-section, encompassing songs from all of their albums, with "Do I Do," from the latest album, gathering a huge response from the

crowd. "Say About Love" closed the second set. 
The crowd, eage'r for an encore, showed its desire with the cheer performed during kickoffs of Irish football games, and the BoDeans responded. After Neumann called the cheer "one of the coolest things" he's ever heard, the crowd repeated it, much to his delight. 
"Say You Will," from the first album, was the first song of the encore, followed by "Naked." An exceptional version of "Good Work" ended the concert on a high note. 
The music was complemented with a colorful lighting display, which was effective despite being simplistic for this age of multi-million dollar light shows. 
Will T. Massey opened the show with an acoustic set. His voice, somewhere in between John Mellencamp and Bruce Springsteen, helped to carry his folk-rock numbers.

WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) ­Purdue sophomore Travis Trice is on trial, and Ball State will help determine the verdict for the Boilermakers' point guard in the preseason National Invitation Tournament. 
MThe job is up for grabs," said coach Gene Keady, who sends the Boilermakers against Ball State at Mackey Arena on Thursday night. 
MTravis is going to get the first shot. I want him to be a little waterbug. I want him all over the place," Keady said. "I want him getting after folks, pressuring the ball, being there when someone throws a care­less outlet pass." 
Trice, a 6-foot-1, 182-pounder from Princeton, Ind., had more assists (70) than points (59) while making seven starts and playing in 27 games last season. 
"I want him to forget about scoring. I want him to get the ball to people,"·Keady said. "The thing that will happen when he forgets about scoring, he'll become a scorer. When he's not worried about it, he'll get in the flow .... Our offense is flexible and everybody can score if you do what you prac­tice." 
Keady will go with the same starting unit he used in two ex­hibition games -a 79-77 loss to the AAU High Five team and 76-54 victory over the Cuban National team. Matt Painter and Ian Stanback will be at forward, Craig Riley at center and Woody Austin and Trice in the backcourt. 

A victory over Ball State would send the Boilermakers against the winner of Thursday night's first-round game between No. 13 Oklahoma State or Evansville on Saturday. The winner of that game moves on to New York for next week's semifinals. 
"We're young. Defensively we may not be able to stop any­thing. It's going to be interest­ing," Keady said about prospects of advancing to Madison Square Garden. 
Austin, a former Indiana high school Mr. Basketball who missed the second half of last season because of academic ineligibility, and Riley are the team's only seniors. Painter is the only junior. 
''I'm not sure we're that tal­ented or experienced to get by Ball State, or someone like Oklahoma State or Evansville. This is the youngest team I've ever had here and you're not going to win a lot with young players. You've got to get some experience under your belt."

Observer Staff Report 
"It's time for the diaper dandies, baby!" 
College athletic recruiting is in full swing in all sports, and the Notre Dame women's tennis team has already received let­ters of intent from a core of of 'prime-time' players. 
Sherri Vitale, daughter of television color commentator Dick Vitale and sister of current Irish sophomore tennis player Terri Vitale, tops the group. Also destined for the Irish squad next year will be Holyn Lord and Wendy Crabtree. 
-Vitale, the Bradenton, Fla. native, was 31st in the 1990 girls rankings. She won the Florida high school singles title last spring and took the double title as a sophomore in '90 for St. Thomas High School. In 1989, she reached the semifi­
-
nals of the national indoor amateur championships. A native of Carmel, Ind., Holyn Lord is currently ranked 33rd in the 1990 girls 16 poll and fourth in the Western Section of the United States. She was the Indiana state champion as a freshman and sophomore wbile enrolled at Carmel High School. 
The Observer 


BALTIMORE (AP} -Cal Ripken won his second American League MVP award on Tuesday, becoming the first player in the league to capture the trophy as a member of a losing team. 
The Orioles shortstop hit .323 with 34 homers and 114 RBis as Baltimore went 67-95 and. rmished sixth in the seven-team AL East. He received 15 first­place votes, eight seconds, four thirds and one seventh for 318 points in balloting by the Baseball Writers Association of America. 
Cecil Fielder of the Detroit Tigers, who led the majors with 133 RBis and tied for the ma­jor-league lead in homers with 44 homers, was second with 286 points. Fielder, the runner­up last year to Oakland's Rickey Henderson, got nine first-place votes, 12 seconds, six thirds and one seventh. 
Frank Thomas of the Chicago White Sox was third with 181 points, Jose Canseco of the Athletics was fourth with 145 points and Joe Carter of the Toronto Blue Jays was ftfth with 136 points. 
Ripken was AL Rookie of the Year in 1982 and MVP in 1983, when the Orioles won the World Series. This time, he did it with a team that was out of con­tention by early May. 
He becomes only the third player in baseball history to capture the award as part of a losing team. Ernie Banks did it in 1958 and 1959 with the Chicago Cubs and Andre Dawson, also of the Cubs, won it in 1987. 
Ripken established career highs in average, home runs and RBis and was the All-Star MVP after hitting a game-win­ning homer. One day earlier, he won the All-Star home run con­test. 
His 1991 postseason awards include player of the year honors from The Associated Press and The Sporting News. 
Ripken's consecutive games streak is up to 1,572-second­best in baseball history behind Lou Gehrig's 2,130-but this year he proved he is more than merely an iron man. 
Ripken's 34 homers made him the eighth player in major league history to hit at least 20 homers in each of his first 10 full seasons. Banks is the only other shortstop to hit .300 with 30 homers and 100 RBis. 
Of all his accomplishments this season, Ripken is most proud of his batting average, which was 49 points higher than his career mark. He didn't dip below .318 after the third-day of the season. 
"This year I got back to the level of efficiency that I am used to," he said last month. "The best thing about this year was being about to go out and be consistent on a daily basis. My batting average reflects that. 
''I'm very happy with the way I played this season. I'm not the kind of player who's going to hit 10 homers in 12 games, but then I wasn't going to go 0-for­50 either. I don't think I went through a slump all year." 
Ripken earned a $100,000 bonus on top of his $2.2 million salary. Carter got a $50,000 bonus added to his $3 million salary for finishing fifth.

Terri VItale 
The following year, Lord rolled to a perfect 54-0 record. She did not play prep tennis as a junior afte·r transferring to Brebuef High School in Indianapolis. In 1988 she won the national 14's doubles tour­nament. 
Wendy Crabtree, from Concord, Mass., is currently ranked 42nd in the 1990 Girls 16 poll. An outstanding all­around athlete at Concord­Carlisle High School, she led her prep soccer team to the state title as the leading scorer last season. 
As a freshman, Crabtree won the state's high school doubles title and led her school to a team championship as a sophomore. She is ranked third in the N~w England Tennis Association poll for her age group. 
Women's Basketball Coach Muffet McGraw is also busy re­cruiting high school talent. McGraw recently signed Stacy Fields, a three year starter from Mounds View High School in Indianapolis who earned North Suburban all-conference honors each year. 
Fields, a third-team Street & Smith's prep selection, alter­nated between guard and for­ward as a junior, averaging 
17.1 points and 7. 9 rebounds. The left-handed Fields had 89 assists, 32 steals and 21 blocks last season, leading the Mustangs to a 16-8 record last year. 
Fields earned all-Metro honors from the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, and also earned all-Metro honors for the fourth straight year as the Mustangs' soccer goalie. 
"Stacy will fit in very well with our program," says McGraw. "She's a great person and player. She'll compliment Michelle (Marciniak} and Audrey ~Gomez) and we expect her to step in and make imme­diate contributions. We're elated to have her join our team."

Wednesday, November 20, 1991 
At the same time, the Irish motion game bogged down in a sea of indecisiveness. In their effort to be unselfish, they were passing up wide-open chances. 
"We had good opportunities that we didn't take," added MacLeod. 
Notre Dame tried to follow MacLeod's advice late in the game, cutting the Athletes in Action lead down to seven with 
4:44 remaining, but then Smith hit two free throws, and pulled up and hit an 18-footer to start a 9-2 spurt that built the lead back to 14 with 1:22 left. 
"We made a rush, but they were able to hold us off," said MacLeod.

"We're going to be a really good team," said Sweet, who never got on-track after early foul trouble. "We know exactly where we made our mistakes, so we know what we have to do to improve." 
A balanced scoring attack by Jay Peters (18 points}, Keith Smith (17} and Lorenzo Romar (16} improved AlA's record to 8-6.

A.I.A. Qutrun, gun Irish 87-76 

By DAVE MCMAHON Associate Sports Editor 
Team speed and a 39-14 foul shot advantage combined to shut down an early Notre Dame lead as Athletes in Action rolled past the Irish men's basketball team last night at the Joyce ACC, 87-76. 
Forward LaPhonso Ellis led the Irish in their second and fi­nal exhibition game with 19 points and 10 rebounds. Freshman Billy Taylor followed with 15 points on 7 -of-9 shoot­ing. 
After Notre Dame took a 20­12 lead on six points from Taylor and four from Joe Ross, AlA finished the half with a 30­13 run for a 42-33 halftime advantage. 
"They spread us out in the first half," said Notre Dame coach John MacLeod. "We were making nice moves, but we had a flurry of turnovers. Then we began to shoot poorly." 
In the second half, AlA picked up where it left off, building on an 18:00 stretch in which the Irish were outscored 50-20. 
"It was the best job we've done all year with being pa­tient," said AlA coach Dave Lower. "We ran our screens well and had good cuts." 
In an attempt to thwart AlA's speed, MacLeod played all 13 scholarship players, but couldn't find a suitable combi­nation. The Irish shot .500 (32­

64) but could not rmd the bot­tom of the net at crucial times. 
After center Keith Tower drew two quick fouls in the first half, MacLeod replaced him with Joe and Jon Ross throughout the remainder of the game. In 13 minutes of ac­tion, Tower tallied four points and two fouls. Joe Ross added six points (3-of-4) in 18 minutes of play. 
"Quickness was a factor in limiting Tower's time," said MacLeod. "It was a tough cover for him tonight." 
Freshman Malik Russell had six points and seven rebounds in 19 minutes of play. Russell and Taylor, both freshman, played much of the second half alongside Elmer Bennett (3-for­10 from the field), Daimon Sweet at small forward. 
"We used some different line­ups to get a little quickness," said MacLeod. "We missed some wide open jumps shots and had some good opportuni­ties to shoot that we didn't take advantage of." 
Notre Dame, 1-1 in exhibition games, failed to convert on many rebound goals, as the Irish out-rebounded AlA 41-29. Ellis (8-of-14 from the field) made sure he didn't miss on one occasion. 
Taking the ball from shin­level in his right hand, Ellis cut AlA's lead to 35-30 on a mam­moth windmill dunk. 
Foul shots, or lack thereof. plagued the Irish, as they hit only 7-of-14 for the game. AlA took advantage of the bonus si­tuation, as Notre Dame recorded its seventh team foul at 9:24 remaining in the first half and 7:56 left in the second. 
Offensively, 19 Irish turnovers allowed AlA to implement its speedy transition game. 
Despite a poor team perfor­mance, MacLeod said the Irish are not discouraged. Taylor agreed with MacLeod's assess­ment. 
"We have to get a better feel for each other," said Taylor. "We'll keep working at it and soon the open shots will start falling. We're not worried about that." 
The Irish open their regular season next Tuesday, hosting Butler at the Joyce ACC. 
"We need to settle down, catch a stride and develop a rhythm," said MacLeod. "That's not an easy solution." 
Although the seniors played three years of zone defense un­der Digger Phelps, MacLeod's man-to-man style has been wel­comed by the team. Against AlA, the Irish showed that an unfamiliar style can lead to de­fensive problems. 
"We softened up on defense when we got tired," said
