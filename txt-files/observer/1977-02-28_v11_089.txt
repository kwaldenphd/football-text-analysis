SBP candidates expand platforms 
by Barbara Breitenstein News Editor 
Repeating and expanding on their platforms, eight of nine Student Body president candidates appeared before about SO students last night in a forum held in Alumni Hall. Rich Hohman was not available to appear at the forum, the second such meeting between students and candidates. 
During the forum, -each can­didate was given time to make a speech and then address questions from students. Each candidates was also given the opportunity to address one question to one other candidate. 
Ricci-Eck 
Ken Ricci, emphasized that the Student Body president must be "99 percent perspiration and one percent inspiration," the platform being the inspiration and the work being the rest. 
Ricci stated three goals of his administration as dealing with social space, rallying input from students and organizing student government. "The first two are t]!e most important," Ricci said, "but they are ignored.'' Ricci and Mark Eck, his running mate, specified improvement as giving $25,000 to the halls and $20,000 for the Nazz, opening a book and record or flea market co-op in LaFortune, provid­ing more business courses fo; non-business majors and making judicial boards a "more effective entity.'' 
In the question -and answer period, Ricci stated lie and Eck intended to "rally input" by going out to students, going to each hall once a month to meet with students and through hall representatives, who would be responsible for finding student problems by talk­ing to students in their halls and reporting back to the SBP. 
Bender-Soma 
The difference between his and other candidates' platforms, Dave Bender commented, is in three areas. These are a restructuring of the Student Life Council (SLC). 
~hich would include less faculty and introduce rectors into the organization, making the Student Union more accountable to Student Government by "getting more people involved in the decision­making process," and by using the Alumni Board as a vehicle to accomplish student goals. 
Bender also emphasized the experience of his running mate, Tom Soma, in such areas as the calendar controversy, the laundry problem and dealing with Iarmer Brown's pigs controversy. 
In the question and answer period, questions dealt primarily with Bender's proposal to restruc­ture the SLC. Bender replied that while some administrators on the Council do reside in dorms, "their main focus and thrust of their jobs is not to handle dorm life. We want to get the rectors who have been directly involved in this and are aware of the personal needs of the people i~ dorms." 
Mooney-Morrison 
"Realism" and "continuity" are the basic ideals which Patrick Mooney and Bruce Morrison would implement as Student Body Presi­dent and Vice-president. To achieve this, Mooney proposes to introduce to the Student Govern­ment constitution a provision that the Student Body vice-president must be either of sophomore or freshman. "This would promote continuity and inter-class coopera­tion," Mooney stated, "and would allow the lower echelons of the executive branch to move up the 
' following year." Mooney stated in response to the question that he doesn't think his inexperience is any hinderance. "The job is not well explained anywhere," he said. "You just have to go through the cycle to know what are the good and bad decisions. No other experience other than being president can prepare you for the job." 
Miranda-dinton 
SBP candidate Ralph Miranda emphasized he is "for an open government, accountable and visi­ble to the students." To achieve this, Miranda proposed three goals --publishing a student government newsletter, opening a direct tele­phone line to the SBP and making the government a "smaller more efficient working body by eliminat­ing the inefficient bodies.'' This last change would not be effected until in office, where he could see where it is needed, Miranda said. 
Parietals would be examined by a Miranda administration, in order to "find out if (changes in it) can't be done, then why, so we're not rehashing the same thing every year," he said. The purpose of this is to "get everybody's opinion down.'' 
Hardy-Mclver 
"We are trying to mix realism and idealism. It is the duty of the student government to provide avenues in the real world," Deborah Mciver, SBVP candidate explained the Valerie Hardy­

Ombudsman election committee cites SBP campaign violations 
ND collective bargaining card campaign begins. 
The Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) announced to­day that its "card campaign" fOr support to petition a collective bargaining election is well under way. 
-Professor James Robinson, pres­ident of the Chapter, reported that an initial group of more than one , hundred faculty members have signed cards. Now letters with cards have been sent to all eligible faculty. 
Collection of signed "designa­tion cards", as they are called, is a method to gather evidence for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) that there is adequate interest in collective bargaining to justify an election. The card campaign then is just one step in a possible move toward a collective · bargaining election. 
Under NLRB guidelines, the AAUP Chapter would need signed cards from 30 percent of the facu,lty to petition for an election. Robin­son indicated, however, that the Chapter seeks cards from consider­ably more than 30 percent so that it can consider petitioning for an election. as a feasible step. In an election, the Chapter would need a majority of votes cast to become the faculty's bargaining agent. 
The AAUP Chapter presented its case for collective bargaining in a pamphlet distributed to the Faculty in early February. Robinson noted that the arguements for a collective bargaining system at Notre Dame are centered on two issues: the improvement of the faculty role in academic governance and faculty cooperation with the administration in the allocation of available funds for the best possible teaching­learning-research situation. 
Although f~culty compensation is a concern, this issue is subord­inate to the two central issues. 

In Feb. 197S, a Faculty Senate questionaire revealed an interest by a significant number of faculty in learning more about collective bargaining. The Notre Dame· AAUP Chapter then joined the Senate in sponsoring a series of guest speakers and discussion!' during the 197S-76 academic year. Then an AAUP quesi.ionaire of Apr. 1976,. revealed that S2.9 percent of those responding (61 percent returned the question­naire) wanted Notre Dame AAUP to initiate procedures that would allow the Faculty to choose or reject collective bargaining. 
The AAUP Chapter proceeds with the "card campaign." Mem­bers of the Library Faculty, the Special Professional Faculty, the Special Research Faculty, and the Teaching and Research Faculty are eligible to sign cards, except those with administrative positions above the level of chairman, and some other categories such as visiting faculty and others with temporary appointments for this year. 
Robinson requests that faculty members who did not receive a card and accompanying letter but who feel they are eligible to receive a card should call him or 
send  him  a  note  through  the  
English Department office.  
Robinson  emphasized  that  the  

signed designation cards will be held in strict confidence and that a signed card is, in effect, a vote to proceed with a co1.1ective bargain­ing election. The signed cards themselves do not make the AAUP Chapter a negotiating agency. 
Signed cards should be sent either to Alberta Ross, vice-pres­ident of the Notre Dame AAUP Chapter lOS Radiation Research Labratory or James Robinson at 3S6 O'Shaughnessy.

official campaign penod had start­ed. The committee viewed this endorsement as early campaign­ing. To make up for this "early start," as Cawley labelled it, Planner Hall was asked to come out with a ditto that listed the other eight candidates and certain basic informatio:1 about them. The Ombudsman typed the ditto, the Ricci ticket ran it off and Planner Hall paid for it, according to Cawley. 
Ricci's second violation had to do with making his own petitions. ''All candidates must use petitions that can be picked up at the student government office. We ran out of petitions because people were tak­ing a lot on Tuesday," Cawley said. 
"Ricci then· took liberties and ran off his own petitions on W ednes­day. As a result of this. he was prohibited from petitioning as of

At an Ombudsman press con­ference last Friday afternoon, Election Committee Director Tim Cawley went over _violations com­mitted up to this point in this years Student Body President's race. 
"We're not trying to incriminate any one candidacy by making the violations public," Cawley said. "We just want to clear up all the rumors that have been floating around;" 
Several charges dropped 

The first item Cawley covered concerned the candidacy of John Talbot. Talbot is a contestant in this year's Bengal flouts. The South Bend Tribune printed a summary of the fighters in Talbot's weight class which brought up the fact the Talbot was running for Student Body President. Normally. this type of publicity is fine. 
according to Cawley, but the article was published before the legal commencement of campaigning. After an investigation, the Election Committee found Talbot had noth­ing to do with the article, so the issue was dropped. Talbot is now legally using reprints of this article as part of a campaign poster. 
Cawley then mentioned that a charge againstSBP candidate Dave Bender for illegally campaigning at a hall meeting before the official campaign period had been investi­gated and subsequently dropped. 
Ricci ticket draws penalties 
Three violations were detected in the Kenn Ricci-Mark Eck ticket and penalties have been assessed. according to Cawley and Clark 
Carmichael.  a  member  of  the  
election committee.  
The  first  violation  was  an  en·

Luchini, Finnegan unopposed in SLC elections 
by Gregg Bangs PoUtlcal Editor 
One candidate each is running 
for the open North Quad and 
Off-Campus Student Life Council 
positions. 
The South· Quad position is not 
up for election this year because 
Peter Haley, its current representa­
tive, decided to exercise an option 
that allows him to hold office for 
two years. If a sophomore runs for 
a position on the SLC, that person 
can choose to remain in office for 
two years. Haley cho~t:: this option. 
Luchini late entry to 
North Quad race 1 
Gary Luchini is currently the only person running for the North Quad SLC position. Barb Smith, a junior from Breen-Phillips, pulled out of the race because she was upset that the Campaign Committee (part of the Ombudsman) in an attempt to get mo!iC people to run, gave an 
Augusta to house mor~ students 
extension of two days for people to turn in SLC petitions. Although her name is still on the ballot, Smith is not campaigning and considers herself "not in the running." Luchini filed his petition during the extension period. 
Luchini said he's running be­cause he "likes to get involved and saw the SLC spot as a good opportunity.'' 
.. 1 figured if I tried hard, I could get something accomplished," the Stanford sophomore said yesterday in an interview with the Observer. "I found out she (Smith) was running unopposed, which is never a good deal, so I decided to run.' .. 
He sees the role of the SLC as one that should relay student opinion to the faculty and admini­stration. He also thought there should be a greater emphasis on intermediate and short range prob­lems, instead of long range issues. "I'm in favor of studying such long range issues as parietals and co-ed housing, but I can't see spending ninety percent of the SLC's time on issues that won't affect the average student's stay here," he said. 
Luchini would like to increase student input into! the SLC. He would do this by keeping in touch with students, either on the cam­pus, hall or individual level. "The SLC representatives are not in touch with their constituents and that's why they're 'limited to deal­ing with-just long -range issues-­they really don't .know what the students want," he continued. 

He would also like to see the SLC consider a new party policy, re­gardless of whether an Indiana 19-year-old drinking law passes or not. Luchini thinks the University should officially reqognize a double major. "If you qo all the hard work, you should get credit for it," he stated. l 
I 
Finnegan runs tor 0-C post 

Terry Finnegan,; the only candi­date for the off-c~mpus position, feels integration is 'acking between off-campus studen1s and the cam­pus. "There are 1 certain advan­tages to living off-dampus, most of which are pretty o~vious," Finne­gan said in an interview last week. "But there is no rbason to suffer the disadvantages that off-campus students presently o," he added. 
"I would like to increase com­munication and integration to the degree that people want. The fact that they moved off-campus shows they don't want that much, but I would like to work on areas where they'd like some action," he ex­plained. 
Finnegan said he was more interested in long range plans, but would take action on a short range issue if one came up. "The way it looks now, the off-campus position of the SLC will be the only elected position held by an off-campus resident," he said. "!would like to integrate this post to the concerns, whether long range or short range, of the off-campus students.'' 
Peter Haley, the South ; Quad representative, feels the SL'C has evolved into a long range concept­ual role. "Student Union, Student Government, and the Hall Presi­dent's Council are all concerned with resolutions on short and intermediate range problem~.'' he said last night. ''The SLC takes an overall view on student life, a$ they are doing on sexuality right pow. It's attacking from the core. \ This type of view must be to institute any specific practical plans.'' 
Haley thinks the Observer has done a "gross injustice to the SLC." "Right now the SLC is clearly ineffectual, but the paper shouldn't berate it," he said. "If the paper would give credit where credit is due, the decline of the SLC would be pointed where it should be. When the prov"st of the University said it should die be­cause it serves no purpose, it's clear the cause of the decline should be thrown at the administra­tion, not at us," he said. 
Haley thinks the bOdy can make contributions. "We're the only group with both the faculty and administration inCluded in our structure. There are a lot of concerned people on the council and the c~uncil is . dying to have issues," he continued: 
Looking ahead to his next term, Haley commented, "I think the SLC is making a good attempt. Instead of dealing with short range plans, I'd rather get on a general, overall level and make decisions on overall student life.'~ 

by Mary Rukavina 
Approximately 150 St. Mary's sophomores and juniors attended a meeting in Augusta Hall last night to learn about living in Augusta next year. 
Junior Class President Nancy 
M<>gab, told the group of students 
that the plan for next year is to 
keep Augusta a senior-junior dorm, 
with the seniors getting first prior­
ity in the lottery. Augusta Presi­
dent explained to the group "that 
there are now 56 girls in Augusta, 
most of whom are seniors, while a 
few juniors filled up the empty 
spaces." 
Mogab added, "There will be 
an additional 15 beds in Augusta 
next year to accomodate more 
students. The distribution of the 
rooms will be: 33 singles, three 
doubles, two triples and six 
quads." Both White and Mogab 
expressed disenchantment with the 
proposed distribution of rooms. 
"I don't know how they plan to 
fill those six quads next year, we 
had a hard time filling the three 
triples this year," White stated. 
Mogab agreed, adding, "By the 
time you are a senior, you are less 
tolerant and do not want to live in a 
quad. Most seniors are going to 
want singles, and the idea of filling 
all six of those quads is unrealis­
tic." Mogab and White did say, 
however, that they thought there · 
might be some juniors who want 
the quads. 
lnadditionto the extra rooms next 
year, one resident advisor is being 
added to Augusta. She will be

BEFORE. 

~ 
Russeii-Geppert 
Ambition makes promises-but 
experience delivers. 
Our campaign slogan, we feel, 
clearly sets us apart from our 
opponents. For the past week, you 
the student body have had your 
consciences beseiged by an army of 
candidates trying to convince you 
that their ideas were the ones 
capable of making Notre Dame a 
midwestern Eden. But close scru­
tiny of their platforms, undetailed 
and in some cases unresearched, 
provide little evidence of a forth­
coming Utopia. Our ticket, though, 
has something different to offer­
experience. Every leader must 
have ideas, but the best leader is 
the one who implements those 
ideas and turns them into realities. 
We challenge any other ticket to 
match the experience we offer, the 
experience so badly needed in 
student government if it is ever to 
become the efficient machine and 
forceful voice of the students it can 
and should be. 
In my freshman year, I served in a campus-wide capacity as Chair­man of the Freshman Adivsory Council and turned an idea, fresh­man cars after Easter break, into a reality. My sophomore year, as President of Holy Cross Hall, I again took ideas that had been kicked around for years, a hall weight room and hall formal and turned them into actualities. This year, as the third highest elected official on campus, Chariman of the Hall President's Council, I made the idea of greater co-operation and understanding among the HPC, ~tu<tent Government and Student Union a reality, by allowing and encouraging representatives of these respective bodies to attend and participate in all HPC meet­ings. In addition to my duties as HPC chairman this year, I also organized the Student Union book exchange first semester, at that time the most voluminous to date. 
My running mate, John Geppert, lends a hall perspective to our ticket that gives it a balance which distinguishes us still further from our oppoqents. As Dillon Hall vice-president this year, and a former hall social commissioner, John is in tune with the attitudes and needs of dorm residents. He knows what needs to be done, and what you want done. This balance will prevent us from becoming deaf to the cries our constituents. 
In summary then, our theme is this: An idea is only as valuable as the person implementing it, is capable. No other ticket has shown itself as capable, we feel, and that is the issue we ask you to vote on. We're making pledges: utilize HPC (most representative body) for comment on students campus wide concerns, 'campaign of famili­arity,' zero base budgeting (stu­dent Union and Student Govern­ment), social space, social needs, but we're asking you to vote for us because we're the ones who can deliver the goods. If you're simply voting for campaign rhetoric, choose any of our opponents. Ifyou want a continuation of stagnant and 
ineffective student government, a similar procedure is appropriate. But if you are looking for a ticket that can turn ideas into reality and fulfill it pledges, then the choice is clear, vote Russeli-Geppert, Tues­d~_y, March 1. 



Ricci Eck 
Mark and I think that after all the 

talk of communication and revitili­
zation is done, two critical areas set 
our ticket apart from all the rest. 
The first area deals with giving you 
the students some specific and 
tangible goals that we feel we can 
achieve. And the second area 
concerns our unique combination of 
university-wide experience through 
my work in the Student Union and 
Mark's experience as a hall presi­
dent from one of the largest dorms 
on campus. 
The specific goals we are talking 

about stem from the fact that next 
year there will be $125,000 that we 
will have to work with. Since the 
student government and union ran 
well on $80,000 this year, there will 
be an extra $45,000 we would like 
to spend on dorm and campus 
social areas. Specifically spending 
about $25,000 on dorm social areas, 
and 20,000 dollars to rennovate the 
Nazz into a larger and more 
pub-like area. 
We will create a book-record 

co-op that runs all year long in 
LaFortune. 
I'm working right now with the 

dean of the business school to 
hopefully acquire more funds to 
enable more teachers to be hired 
who could offer more courses to 
non-business students. 
We'll use the new legal interpre· tation of the Faccenda Bill to fight for a more lenient alcohol policy on campus. 
The University Judicial board is a joke right now, but it can be an excellent source of student rights. By bringing law students in to help on both the university and ball levels we can make the judicial system just for both the students and the administration. 
There are over 1,000 off-campus students here at Notre Dame who have lost all contact with student government. We'll have off­campus representatives who will come directly to us with problems that we can use student govern­ment to solve. But most impor­tantly Mark and I will personally come off-campus to monthly town meetings. 
We definitely feel that our experience will enable us to make these ideas work. I've dealt with the administration now success­fully for over a year. They know who I am, thus there will be no loss of valuable time spent in just meeting the administrators. 
Finally, I promise to stay here over the summer when there is less pressure on everyone and work to have our ideas approved and under way when you return next year. 
Remember, Mark and I will come to you, we won't just assume that you'll come to us. 
Vote Kenn Ricci and Mark Eck Thank you. 

Talbot-Hughes 
We see the present Student Government as being ineffective not because of its present structure but because of lack of cooperation and inability to work together between Student Government and Student Union and even within the members of Students Government and Student Union and even within the members . of Student Govern­ment itself. We see this as a situation easily overcome simply by establishing a good working relationship between members of both organizations from the very start. The tools for an effective Student Government are present in the current structure of Student Government and with proper man­agement it can be made effective. Forming more decision making bodies in Student Government: we see to be just more red tape and even less representation of the students. There are already repre­sentatives from each hall in the form of hall social commissioners, 
j-board leaders, academic commis­sioners etc. The Student Govern­ment official in these respective areas should be in contact with them on a regular basis thus these would be the necessary input to Student Government from the halls. One representative can't truly represent the large halls or have a good deal of knowledge in all aspects of hall life thus is really useless. We are seeking to achieve the following realistic goals. 
1) Judicial -duLac explicitly states that if a student commits a violation against the hall or univer­sity rules, his or her case is to be considered by either the hall or university Judicial board unless the student chooses to have his case heard by his rector or the dean of students. This is not the procedure that is in practice now· though. Getting responsible people ap· pointed to hall j-boards and reacti­vating the university j-board will be one of our main objectives. 
2) Social-The university does realize the need for an increased amount of social space on campus but just how soon and how much will largely be determined by the workings of the SBP 11nd his (or her) officers. We~~.. dte majority of social activit:.!~ taJting place on the hall and club level. We plan to put out a booklet Iising all possible social activities and exactly how to go about organizing them. Also we want to see better utilization of Stepan Center. There is a great deal of good talent coming out of Chicago (2nd City for example) that would love to come to N.D. and can provide great entertainmnet at very reasonable costs. 
3) Off-Campus-We realize that most off-campus students are more independent in nature and won't come to Student Government for help therefore we plan to go to the 0-C student with programs like hallmark, on campus storage over breaks etc. We also want to implement a daily shuttle system to key off campus places such as Campus View, St. Louis Ave. and 
N.D. apartments etc. This shuttle would make direct runs to these places and back to campus three to four times a day when students are most likely .to .be commuting. to or Monday, February 28, 1977 the observer

from campus. this would be especially valuable during the win­ter months when cars don't,;c.tart and walking is an unbearable task. 
4) Awareness-At Notre Dame there are numerour programs and organizations for student interests and to aid them in every possible way but most people aren't aware of their existence. Through a weekly or bi-weekly column in the observer or by other means if necessary, we want to help the students realize all that they have available to them. 
In conclusion, Student Govern­ment is here to help represent and aid the students in every way possible. It must be the coordina­tor of all activities and programs on campus because it has info coming in from sources all over campus and can help make these activities a success. ' 

Miranda-Clinton 
In an open letter to the students, Ralph and I would like to explain some of the programs we would carry out if elected to office. We would also like to explain how we organized our campaign and some of our personal feelings about how it was run. 
The student government should be an organization that is open, available and helpful to the stu­dents whom it is representing. It is neither a joke, nor a secretive organization whose activities and inner workings are but known to a few. A direct phone line to the president, a campus newsletter explaining what the student government has accomplished, and hall visits are but a few of the ideas that could be implemented. Com­munication· is a very important aspect of a well-functioning government. Through better com­
--munication with the students, hall governments and the administra­tion many problems and conflicts could be avoided. Scheduling conflicts between concerts, parties, and dances could be avoided. A more even distribution of activities throughout the semester is impor­tant. It appeared that some weekends many students had noth­ing to do, while on other weekends they were deluged with numerous activities of various sorts. The possibility of the establish­ment of a gathering place on campus such as a pizza parlor with an informal type atmosphere has been considered. Through such a site, interaction between students, faculty, and parents could be improved. If the drinking age were lowered to 19, beer could be served on the premises. Once in office we would evaluate the possibilities of such a meeting place and accom­plish this goal. We consider a re-evaluation of hall visiting hours a very important part of our platform. Through discussion of this matter with students, rectors, and the adminis­t-.l.tion we could find out exactly what each group wants and what is feasible. A campus wide question­naire would be distributed to the students, and the results reviewed so as to arrive at some middle-of­the-road solution in which everyone would be in agreement. These we consider to be the most important points of our platform. We have arrived at these few maj_or 

points by obtaining the opinions of 
a number of students. We have 
been presented with many other 
proposals, but feel that it is 
necessary to start someplace, and 
work up from there. 
We would like to thank Tim 
Cawley and the rest of the election 
committee for the help they have 
given us in this election. Our 
campaign expenses were $43.67, of 
which about half came out of our 
own pockets, and the rest from 
contributions. We thank our quad 
co-ordinators and hall representa­

tives for all they've done for us. We accomplished a lot with, the 25 people that we worked with and without them, all this would not have been possible. In many cas~s we put up posters in buildings only to find them all torn down the next day and other candidates posters substituted in their place. We have run a clean, honest campaign and therefore feel it would be very easy for us to run the same type of government, one that is honest and 
open to the students. 

Mooney-Morrison 
These past few weeks have been a great learning experience. I have· never been connected with Student Government before, and even this brief candidacy period has shed new light on the University, the Student Government, the "student Body", and many individual stu­dents. The one aspect of the whole situation which stood out the most was the game of electioneering. I have constantly been confronted with a great disparity between what we want to say and what "they" want to hear. 
One of my closest friends re­marked, "Where are your posters? It doesn't look like you guys want to win." I can offer only two explanations. First, one way communication, like this, is limited by both time and space, and eliminates all questions and ex­planations. Second, most of the candidates play defensive politics. Their posters and promises are suited by what people want to hear, not what should be said. 
Where does this leave us? A serious gap has evolved between elections and government. Can­didates display a grand deception to the voters. I question their motives and sense of honesty. I ask that you look beyond the elec­tioneering. Government is a simple machine run by competent people with a sense of purpose. When we offer ourselves as the honest alternative, its more than a slogan, it's what we are. 
How laherendy effecdve Is Student Govemmeat't 
1) Some of the projects students would like to see accomplished cannot be achieved on the Student Government funds alone. In order for these proposals to become realitY Student Government must convince the University that the proposal merits the remaining necessary funds. 
2) Some projects are contrary to the University's image or ideals. Obviously, the University would neither approve nor financially support these projects. Their completion would be greatly ham-· pered.

3) The area in which Student Government is most effective is the structure and content of its own institutions. This efficiency de­pends only upon the opinion and vote of the Student Government and the Student Body. 
With this concept of efficiency, carefully consider the proposals and promises of all the candidates. Our Approach 
 1) we have investigated the primary source material made available by the various student and University organizations. (i.e. Th · Student Government Constitu­tion, duLac, and special reports) 
2) We plan to couple this background material with new information and our own dedication to take on such projects as Student Union tickets sales, cable televi­sion, aspects of coeducation, and social space. 
Our only proposal is to constitu­tionally require that the Vice-Pres­idential candidate be a freshman or sophomore. 
Some may argue that this propo­sal is too restrictive, but in reality the only restriction is that a junior cannot be a Vice-Presidential can­didate. Others may argue that this will set up a ruling elite because the previous year's Vice-President can run for the Presidency. We believe "re-election" will be a strong check on any incompetent Vice-President who desires the Presidency. 
Our reasons for supporting this proposal are threefold. First, it would necessitate( a greater level of inter-class cooperation. Second, it would provide a continuity to student government, whereby the lower echelon personnel associated with the Vice-President would shift upwards in succeeding years. Finally, this system would guaran­tee one experienced potential can­didate in every election. 
We believe this proposal is feasible because unlike many of the other campaign promises our pro­posal does not depend upon money, the University, or extensive cooperation by other students. Our proposal needs only the favorable opinion and vote of you, the student. 

Hohman-Barlett 
You can't change Notre Dame. Student Government hasn't been able to in the past, and the situation won't be any different next year. It's a waste of our time and money to keep throwing a lot of proposals at the administration. 
There aren't too many people here that are really concerned about Student Government, and since Student Government doesn't produce any effective results-why should it be such a big deal? All we want to do is make Student Government simple. All we prom­ise is that if elected-it won't be a big deal. It all you "apathetic students" unite and vote Hohman­Bartlett tomorrow-we'll keep our promise.

Bender-Soma 
The biggest question of this election finally seems to be: what is the difference between the nine . candidates, or what does it matter who is electe4, since they all seem to be the same. The answer is that all nine candidates are not the same, and it wiD make a tangible difference who you choose to elect on Tuesday. 
Tom Soma and I differ from the 
other eight candidates in several 
important wa~·s, ways which we 
think best quaiify us to serve you as 
President and Vice-President. 
First of all, look at all the 
candidates' platforms. You'll no­
tice that the Bender/Soma ticket is 
the only ticket that is trying to get 
the SLC to deal with what it is 
meant to deal with, i.e. Student 
Life. The fact is that the Student 
Life Council does not deal with 
student life, and has failed to affect 
our lives in any way for the past 
three years. The SLC spent their 
last meeting discussing Christian 
Sexuality--a good topic for a 
discussion group perhaps, but not 
for the body on campus that is to 
make recommendations, sugges­
tions, and proposals to the Admini­
stration regarding our lives here. 
All of the other candidates wish 
to keep the SLC in its present form. They talk of "revitalizing" it, or giving it more "input," but what do these terms really mean? If elected, Tom Soma and I would restructure the SLC and replace the ·Faculty and Administrators with six hall rectors. We feel that student life at Notre Dame revolves around the dormitories, and there­fore the decisions and policie& affecting these dormitories should be made by the very people who live and work there, i.e. the rectors and the students. By restructuring the SLC around the people who most affect and are affected by student life, tangible results can 
and will occur. 
Secondly, we're the only candi­
date to call for any reall accounta­
bility for the Student Union. The 
Student Union handles $51,000 of 
our money each year, and we feel 
that more than one person should 
be involved in the decision-making 
process. H elected, we would 
require the Board of Directors of 
the Student Union to meet once a 
month (they've only met three 
times all year.) In addition, we 
would require the Student Union to· 
present its budget and calendar to 
the HPC at the beginning of each 
semester, so as to avoid foul-ups 
such as scheduling five hall formals 
on the same night as a concert. 
Finally, Tom Soma and I are the only candidates that make any mention of utilizing the alumni for support in a<;hieving our goals. I have met with members of the alumni board and have found them open and willing to help Student Government improve Student Life at ND. Take lighting, for example. Try to tell an alumnus (especially one with a daughter here) that the University feels that it cannot afford adequate lighting on campus to help insure security for its students. 
The alumni understand the im­
pact of only 1.5 sq. ft. of social 
space in Howard Hall and the other halls on campus where social space facilities are poor. The improve ments we seek are legitimate and the alumni will respond to our request for support by way of letters, phone calls, and input. 
There Is a difference between the Bender/Soma ticket and any other ticket, but what is even more important is that Tom and I have the experience to make that differ­ence count. Of course, many of the candidates run~ng can point to long records of service in Student Government, but how many of them have actually made a concrete and tangible difference on your life at Notre Dame? Tom Soma has. Because of my running mate's work on the calendar issue, all of us enjoyed a Thanksgiving break that we weren't destined to enjoy had it not been for Tom. Farmer Brown was reinstated because of Tom's efforts, and by the end of this year, the males at ND will be able to shrink their shirts themselves be­cause of the laundromat that Tom is responsible for. 
As President of Sorin Hall, the Hall's social life has increased measureably, and we became a closer community than before. In, addition, Sorin hosted many cam­pus wide activities on its porch that benefited the University Commu­nity as a whole. 
Finally, I would like to close by asking for your support in making Student Government meaningful. It will never be meaningful here unless a student can honestly say 
-
that their student government has touched them in a positive and individual way. That's what our goal is, that's why we're running, that's what we're all about. 
There is a difference--please vote for that difference--Dave Bender and Tom Soma.

bring in his petitions and we felt he 
made a good effort, although we 
have heard from reliable sources 
that four petitions were still being 
circulated over the weekend,'' he 
continued. 
Carmichael said one reason why the committee took action on this was because Ricci's petitions also had room for phone numbers, something the official petition did not. Cawley admitted there had been some communication prob­lems and took some of the blame for the mix-up, but maintained Ricci altered the petitions. 
The committee fined Ricci one cent a petition an charged it against his $50.00 campaign limit. 
Ricci also had campaign posters set up on Campus Press by a Student union worker before hav­ing it run off at Insti-Print in South Bend. This was viewed as an unfair advantage by the Committee (Campus Press is part of the Student Union of which Ricci is director). Cawley t"'1:plained that the money saved by setting up the poster at Campus Press before bringing it to Insti-Print would be charged against Ricci's campaign limit. The amount was roughly 
~.00. . 
"When we drew up the rules, the election was three weeks away. We never got any questions on campaigns. Little did I realize that campaign staffs were over-zealous. 
, "Rignt now, there are a lot of allegations and very few facts going around," Carmichael said. Cawley closed the conference by saying that "all the tickets in the campaign are clean now. We've taken care of as much as we can."

In September, the Saint Mary's student body finally came alive when a large, enthusiastic crowd attended a meeting supporting extended visitation hours. 
Acting on the results of the meeting and on a Student Government survey showing that eighty percent of St. Mary's students favored the extension, Student Govern­ment created a parietal.s committee. The committee was ordered to review and research the question: 
Now, however, the parietals committee may be forced to end its investigation as a result of student apathy. This may end any hope of extending visitation hours in the future. What happened to all the enthusiasm? 
The committee has worked diligently and consistently since the meeting, send­ing out surveys to parents, alumnae, faculty, administration and students. It did so gladly because you, the students promised you would work for a change. 
Throughout the year, however, the committee sent out and compiled the surveys with little or no extra help. As if this were nbt enough, less than thirty percent of the student body bothered to return the surveys (which only take 15 minutes to fill out) to their R.A.s. Even worse, 'a larger percentage of parents and alumnae responded than did the students. H you are not responsible enough to hand. in your surveys, are you responsible enough to handle extended visitation hours? 
How can you be so apathetic about an issue you were so excited about a few months ago? Have you changed your minds and decided you like the present parietals rule after all? H not, you should get moving. Attending one meeting will not get things done but only give them a start. · Following through is just as important as taking the initial step. 
You still have a chance to receive extended parietals. the surveys returned from alumnae, faculty and administration indicate that they will stand by the decision of the students. Sixty percent of the student body must tum in its surveys by Friday to the R.A.s or Diane Smitts, parietals committee chairperson. Other­wise, the committee will consider the issue closed. Hthe parietals question is dropped because of student apathy, Student Government can only assume that you don't care about anything. H you care at all, come through with your surveys by this Friday.

What the SBP 
I 

Nee.ds --by the SBP 
, mike gassman 
:As campus elections close in on u~, the major focus is on the people running, fighting, clawing, or whatever for Student Body Pres­id!;!nt and Vice-President. I guess I kriow what it was like, I fought that w~r twice in my college career. Nc)w, after a year in office things appear quite differently. 

II have struggled through twelve mpnths that began with a gallant aqd noble perception of the office aqd now near the end with a realistic view of the role of SBP and St]ldent Government -a view you will probably find quite hidden in th~ campaigns to follow. Because of\ this reality that is seldom ad}ressed, I wish to share those di coveries I have made. 
· he first thing of importance for th SBP and SBVP is a vision, a vis~on that can weather the storm an~ remain realistic. It is so easy, and quite tempting campaign-wise, to!tll a. platform with proposals, re ructuring, and promises. 
he ~eak candidate calls for a new "machine" that will make the stu~ent' government more succes­
ful and efficient, contendmg that ne committees and structures will be. better than the present com-m*ees and structures. He lists 
se\leral "issues and concerns" of
,I

students, vowing to solve them all. 
Hei doesn't understand how a 
stuldent government works . nor do~s he realize what his "new 
machine" must do or will do. 
owever, the strong candidate 

un; erstands what can be done and ho\f to do it. His vision is for a hand-working crew of people who wil) attack the issues of student corjcern with success. He knows thajt his accomplishments are tern­perled by time and station -so he 
sedks to conquer what student government can, letting Father 
He$burgh and Jimmy Carter con-

bureaucracy is successful only with the media, ,while hard work and perspiration win the real battles he will face. 
The second factor to consider is conscience and integrity. These are the characteristics hardest to judge in an election, but essential to a good administration. They weigh on every decision of the SBP -many of these decisions which only he will realize had to be made. And most ofall it is conscience and integrity that separate the can-\­didates seeking personal gain from those who work for the students, not themselves. 
Third, and most important is character. When one takes the office, even if he has vision, conscience, ;and integrity, he is constantly upder pressure -from students, press, and administra­tion. He is Criticized, laughed at, and deceived. He is hard-pressed by student apathy, from the whole student body: and at times from his 
own workers~ Many times his work will be rejedted, tabled, or even scoffed at. His success is often gauged by w,hat· hasn't been done 
instead of wliat has. 

The SBP must be able to handle this, remain! objective, and con­centrate on what is to be done. It is up to him an4.· his administration to 
do what is right and to keep to it,
regardless of, how his actions are taken. He can never be a quitter.
These are r,the basics of a good 
SBP and SBVP. However, for 
student government to be success­
ful, there must be continuity and 
' 

professionalism. Everyone wants 
new "solutions." You will never find ''solutio11s" in a platform, they cc,me from long hard work. There are few student issues like the calendar tha~ can be resolved in a single meeti.ng. Social space, 
alcohol, and parietals are resolved 
over time be.cause of their large­scale implications and costs. It is 
imperative for a new student administratior to continue with the work that is presently being done. If one star;ts completely from scratch, you Ican never expect to accomplish the solution of student concerns in dne year. 
Rhetoric \\jill flow, posters and platforms wil~ appear. Statements will be made! of what's wrong with this years st~dent government and how next y~ars will be better. Media and students will speak of poobahs and [apathy. Such is the. nature of a political campaign. 
Take a second glance, a realistic one. Student \Government can and does succeed. Look for vision, integrity' conscience, and charac­ter. Because the people who win face the toughest jobs .--: campus ­believe me.
