Security changes spark debate 

NDSP, hall staff aim to fill void left by fired security monitors 
ance packages NDSP provided, their own slim career alterna­tives and the chances of the current campus dynamic sur­viving without them. 
Now, with four weeks of the new system under its belt, the Notre Dame community has seen glimpses of the answers -and delivered its own responses, from the beneficial to the bleak. 
The Officers 
With the recognizable -and often beloved -monitors as their predecessors, the new officers had to· be people before police, said Hex Hakow, director of NDSP. 
Therefore. in addition to this summer's fire safety, medical and departmental training, officers attended training ses­sions with residence hall staff to personalize their prepara­tion.

Questions prevailed in April when Notre Dame Security/Police decided to eliminate security monitors ­who had been a visible pres­ence in women's residence halls since the University went co-ed in 1972 -from their ranks. 
Female rectors questioned the safety of their residents, asking who would enforce parietals, support hall staffs and calm their fears so they could sleep at night. 
Male rectors questioned the value of the monitors' replace­ment, an outdoor-based com­munity security officer system slated to patrol dorms for both sexes. From their perspective, the move meant more security, not less. 
Monitors themselves ques­tioned everything -the sever-

Mass bril!gs ND, SMC community together in tragedy 
O.ver 100 students and staffgather in prayer at Saint Mary's for O'Connor and Miltenberger families 
By ANGELA SAOUD Saint Mary's Editor 
Over 1 00 students, staff. family and friends gathered at Saint Mary's Hegina Hall chapel Wednesday night for a Mass for Ryan O'Connor, Jackie Miltenberger and their families. 
O'Connor, a 2002 Notre Dame graduate, was killed in a car acci· dent ncar the Notre Dame cam­pus Sunday morning. Miltenberger, who was also involved in the accident, is a cur­rent Saint Mary's sophomore. 
Father Michael Connors, who presided over the Mass. explained that Wednesday was the feast of Our Lady of Sorrows. 
"People are not attracted to sorrows," 

O'Connor
Connors said. "Some might find it too depress­
ing or sad, especially in death. We try to numb the pain, try to deal with our grief and sorrows. and this usually means doing so with a stiff upper lip. What we forget is that those who are left behind still suffer." 
Connors' homily focused on coping with the aftermath of a tragedy. 
"Today's gospel showed Mary standing and watching her son's death," Connors said. "She did not have to be there, she could have ducked into hiding,but she didn't." 

At the end of the Mass, Connors reminded those at the mass to continue praying for everyone involved in Sunday's accident. 
"We gather together today in times of heartbreak and sorrow to support the friends and loved ones of the people who have been touched by this terrible tragedy," he said. "May the O'Connor and Miltenberger families find in us willing, hopeful companions in their moments of need." 
Saint Mary's students were 
notified of the Mass Tuesday through an e-mail from College President Carol Mooney. 
"The reason we decided to have a Mass is that this past 
·weekend's tragic accident affect­ed the entire Saint Mary's and Notre Dame community," Mooney said. "In times of great sorrow and pain it is our tradition as Catholics to gather together in prayer."

'sweet 20' and 
the excitement of being able to vote 
is two years old. Twenty isn't really 
one of those birthdays that people 
excitedly anticipate, except maybe 
for the fact that it kicks off the 
countdown to 21. 
The troubles of my 20th year 
have only been exacerbated by the 
fact that I spent second semester 
last year abroad in Spain. The five 
months of carefree bar hopping, I 
now realize, were a teasing 
glimpse of the fun that is being 
legal. It took only one 12-hour 
flight to rob me of it. 
Being a junior and 20 can curtail your social life. In all likelihood you have friends who are seniors whom you may rarely see thanks to the difference in one little digit. Major campus parties are fun, but overshadowed by the concern of hovering police. Friday night I set out for Lafayette looking forward to a little Kickoff Classic fun. The men in blue stalking the length of the parking lot put me· on edge, however and I was home by 1 a.m. I longed to be one of those cavort­ing 21 years old with unapologeti­cally slurred speech cruising from one apartment to the next. 

The cruelty of 20 is so cutting that it even bars you from helping friends commemorate their free­dom from it. Celebrating someone's 21st when you are still a few months short is punishing. First, jealousy sets in. You know from now on he will be able to take his pick of local joints on Saturday night. They will roll in at ridicu­lously late hours. laughing about some guy who was dancing funny or the girl who dropped her drink, leaving you completely out of the loop. 
Second, you cannot join your friend at midnight for his inaugural bar run nor can you entice the other patrons to join you in a ren­dition of happy birthday. 
When I complain about the bore­dom of 20 to my parents, they always respond positively with some cliche such as 'youth is fleet­ing' or 'these are best days of your life.' Clearly, they had fakes. But as I can't change my date of birth, I am going to buckle down and wait it out. Only 157 days to go.

STUDENT SENATE 
Senate debates na111e change for progra111111ing board 
By AMANDA MICHAELS 
Associate News Editor 
In response to the debate over the restoration of the Student Union Board's former title, Student Senate discussed the issue at their Wednesday meet­ing. 
Cavanaugh senator Jordan Bongiovanni called for an infor­mal meeting to determine why the constitutional mandate to use the name Campus Programming Council was not followed. 
Currently, the student program­ming group uses the name Student Union Board. 
i\t the previous Senate meeting, SUB manager Jimmy Flaherty defended the continued use of the name 'SUB' even though the new constitution required the group to usc 'CPC'. citing limited time

building, and that would be the university," Cohen said. "Even the dining hall used to be in the basement." 
Currently. the Main Building primarily houses the adminis­trative offices of the University. 
In the late 1990s, the University began a major renovation of the Main Building. The building's upper floors were reopened after being closed for decades due to

available to organize his staff and address the issue before school ended in May. 
Student body president Adam Istvan supported Flaherty and said that he and Student Affairs told Flaherty to continue to use 'SUB', as they considered the amendment process an appeal. 
Bongiovanni expressed concern about this situation at podium on Wednesday. 
"Whether it was deliberately intended or influenced by a third or a fourth party, a violation of the Constitution has occurred," she said. "To ignore it is to con­done improper action." 
Bongiovanni acknowledged the difficulties of navigating the new constitutional framework, which she conceded was still "very for­eign" to many of the student lead­ers. and said that she is not look­ing to assign blame to any of the 
structural problems, and three classrooms were added. 
Father Paul Doyle, Dillon Hall rector, said the addition of these classrooms helped return the building to its roots. "[There was]lots of student inter­play with the administrators, because students had their class­es there." Doyle said about the building's past life. "I think it's important to have students and administrators together . . . if you call it the 'administrative build­ing'. students will go there to see administrators, not to interact with the students." 
parties involved. 
"[The informal meeting] will be a process of discovery," she said. "It's about discovering mistakes and correcting them ... about fig­uring out what happened so it doesn't happen again." 
Morrissey senator Josh Pasquesi said he feared that rehashing an already closed topic would promote the stereotype of an apathetic student government. 
Other senators, including Siegfried and Alumni senators James Leito and Vijay Ramanan, supported Bongiovanni. 
Former Keenan senator Dan Zenker also came to the meeting to support the proposal. 
"It's up to you guys to be lead­ers ... and to be aware of mis­takes of the past," he said when yielded the floor. "You don't want to dwell on it, but you want to know what went wrong." 
But what makes the Main Building a special part of Notre Dame's history are the stories and traditions associated with its his­tory. 
"There was a time when you were not supposed to walk up the front steps of the main building until you've graduated," Doyle said. "It's not a tradition many fol­low anymore, but it used to be quite important." 
Although the Main Building has counted numerous priests among its occupants, some of them stand out in the building's lore. 
Father Bernard Lang was a 

The proposed meeting would take place outside the bounds of the Student Senate, and has no specified goal of a resolution or motion to take back to the floor, Bongiovanni said. The option to take the issue to the Ethics Committee was available, but Bongiovanni said she wanted to keep the situation informal to avoid friction between student leaders. 
"It's in any student's right to sit down and talk about something, there's no controversy in that," Student Affairs director Brian Coughlin said. 
No date has been set for the meeting, and because of its infor­mality, senators are not required to attend. 
In other Senate news:

Holy Cross priest who lived in the Main Building in the 1920s-and was also a champion weightlifter. 
"He was the strongest or sec­ond strongest man in the world," said Jim Lyphout, vice president for business operations. 
A picture of Lang now hangs in the tunnel between the Morris Inn and McKenna Hall, Lyphout said. 
In addition to the unique back­ground of the building itself, its famous dome is just as storied.

He listed a number of Rock the Vote events coming up, including faculty panels on foreign and domestic affairs and the debate between the editors of the Nation and the National Review. Quaranta also said that events centered around debate, dialogue or an issue-focused seminar could be arranged in individual dorms to spark student participation. 
"Student government and Rock the Vote are tied in that fighting apathy is fighting apathy," chief executive assistant Dave Baron said when introducing Quaranta. "If students are interested in national politics, then they'll be interested in local politics."

and the Golden Dome," Cohen said. "You can stick your head into the statue and look out onto the quad." 
Throughout Notre Dame's his­tory, students have often scaled the dome as a mark of pride or draped it with a banner before a big football game. 
"All through [it] there are peo­ple who have carved their names," Cohen said. "It used to be a student accomplishment to climb up into the dome."

Britain lawmakers review security 
LONDON -In the second major security breach in London this week, five fox hunting enthusiasts stormed onto the floor of the House of Commons Wednesday to disrupt a debate on banning the centuries-old sport. 
Guards hustled the men away, but the inci­dent showed -as did the man dressed as Batman who scaled the walls of Buckingham Palace on Monday -the vulnerability of Britain's seats of power. One lawmaker said there had not been such an intrusion in Parliament since 1642. 
Security was stepped up immediately, with armed police guarding the chamber in place of the usual footmen and stewards. 
The prime minister was not in the chamber at the time. 
Two Chechen women arrested 
MOSCOW -Two Chechen women suspect­ed of blowing up Russian passenger jets last month were briefly detained by police before the lligh ts but bribed at least one airline employee to get on the planes, media reports said Wednesday. 
One of the alleged suicide bombers used an intermediary to pay $34 to a Sibir airlines employee to board a jet, even though she had a ticket for a flight the next day, the Interfax news agency quoted Russia's Prosecutor General Vladimir Ustinov as say­ing. She got on the plane two minutes before check-in closed, he said. 
The same intermediary also took a bribe from the other alleged suicide bomber to get on a Volga-Aviaexpress flight, he said. 
Ustinov said both the intermediary and the Sibir airline employee have been arrested.

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -Five workers have been fired for their roles in a security and safety scandal at Los Alamos National Laboratory, the lab's director said Wednesday. 
The fired workers were among 23 sus­pended this summer after two computer disks containing classified information went missing. 
The other 18 workers will retain their jobs but will be reprimanded or demoted from management, Director Pete Nanos told The Associated Press. 

Senate votes down overtime rules 
WASHINGTON -A Senate committee voted Wednesday to scuttle new rules that critics say would deny overtime pay to mil­lions of workers. as Democrats won the lat­est round in their election-year bout with President Bush over the issue. 
The 16-13 vote by the Republican-run Senate Appropriations Committee came less than a week after the GOP-led House embar­rassed Bush by approving a similar measure. 
Despite the twin rebukes by Congress, the provision could well disappear when House­Senate bargainers write a final version of the spending bill to which it was attached. GOP leaders and the White House will dominate that part of the legislative process. 
Win or lose, Democrats hope the overtime fight will drive their supporters to vote.

The bodies were found in nylon bags, the heads in bags alongside them, near Dijiel, about 25 miles north of Baghdad, said Col. Adnan Abdul-Rahman of the Interior Ministry. They were all men with tattoos, including one with the let­ter 'H' on his arm. but no documents were found on them, he said. 
A U.S. military official said the bodies appeared to be Iraqis and had their hands tied behind their backs. 
While insurgents have often beheaded foreign hostages in their fight against the government and coalition forces, it is not a tactic usually used against Iraqis, who are more often abducted for money. 

Residents from a nearby village found the bodies shortly after dawn and notified the Iraqi national Turkish Foreign Ministry company said Wednesday fired on a police van north guard, said Iraqi Lt. confirmed he had been it had ceased to operate in of the capital Tuesday, Ahmad Farouk. freed.

IN BRIEF 

Stewart to reclaim life in prison 
NEW YORK -Even at a wrenching moment of surrender. Martha Stewart was -as always -under impeccable control. 
Her announcement Wednesday that she would report to prison as soon as possible came in a light-bathed studio, before a bril­liant backdrop of color swatches, perfectly choreographed for television. She lamented that she would miss her beloved pets -cats, dogs, horses, canaries and chickens -and hoped to be free in time for her cherished spring gardening. 
"I must reclaim my good life," the 63-year­old millionaire businesswoman declared. 

Oil prices fall as hurricane fears end 
WASHINGTON -The loss of more than three-quarters of daily oil production in the Gulf of Mexico, and a significant amount of refining capacity, as a result of Hurricane Ivan should not cause U.S. motorists much long­term pain at the pump -so long as Ivan does not cause the industry any lasting infrastruc­ture damage. 
The expectation of only short-term turbu­lence within the petroleum sector helped push oil prices lower Wednesday, even as Ivan roared toward the Gulf Coast with 135. mph winds and after the government reported that tanker delays had caused a sharp drop in the nation's oil supply. 
Light sweet crude for October delivery fell 81 cents to $43.58 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 

Chipmaker admits to price fixing 
WASHINGTON -German computer chip­maker Infineon Technologies AG has agreed to plead guilty to price fixing and will pay a $160 million fine, the Justice Department announced Wednesday. 
In a plea agreement filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, Infineon acknowl­edged conspiring with other companies to fix prices of computer memory products between July 199'9 and June 2002. 


Economic outlook in question 
Stocks slump on lower forecast from Coca-Cola, declining monetary figures 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Stocks sagged Wednesday after beverage giant Coca-Cola Co. issued a gloomy fore­cast, and a lower-than­expected reading on industrial production for August threw the nation's broader economic outlook into question. 
Investors are watching as companies start to issue outlooks ahead of the third-quarter earnings season. With some corpo­rate forecasts falling short of expectations, worries about a slower second half are intensifying, but analysts said it's really too soon to know what lies ahead. And after four weeks of gains, it makes sense for stocks to take a pause on some less-than­encouraging news. 

"We've been saying for a while that investors need to be much more selective ... this is a stock­picking kind of market," said John Caldwell, chief investment strategist for McDonald Financial Group, part of Cleveland­based KeyCorp.

"This is done to make the hon­ors more meaningful," University Registrar Harold Pace said. "If half of the class is winning honors, is that a mean­ingful award?" 
Other factors also influenced the council's decision, among them alleged grade inflation and, according to Pratt, insur­ance companies. 
"Insurance companies give breaks for dean's list [stu­dents]," she said. 
If a company sees that more than half of the student body at a particular school is placed on the dean's list, it may stop giving breaks to students from that school, according to Pratt. 
As for grade inflation, University administrators still debate the subject. 
"Grade inflation vs. smarter students, which one is right at Notre Dame?" Pace said. "''m not sure." 
According to the 2001 Notre Dame Fact Book, in the spring of 2000, when the Academic

"I don't think it's a bad sys­tem, because it reflects the top tier of the current students," 
said David McCormick, a junior business major. "If Notre Dame is admitting smarter and smarter students each year, the standard for the dean's list should be raised as well." 
Anne Ryckbost, 

a senior in the College of Arts and Letters, disagreed. 
"I don't like it," she said, "It's frustrating when you're shoot­ing for something, each semes­ter you don't know what it will be." 
Though dean's list require­ments generally change each semester, registrar does publish the upcoming semester's GPA requirements at the start of college must choose to post either one required GPA for the entire year, an average of the previous two semesters' GPAs or two GPAs, each based on the previous year's corresponding semester. 
This fall, for instance, the GPA requirement for the College of Arts and Letters is 3.765, and the spring requirement is 3.778. The GPA requirement for the College of Science is 3. 7 45 for the entire year. 
"We elected to move to sepa­rate ones for fall and spring because we are a large college and because we noticed a real difference in GPA between the two semesters," said Pratt of the College of Arts and Letters. "We felt it was more equitable to rec­ognize the difference."

Faith-It Isn't Just for Sundays Any More!! 
by Tami Schmitz, Director of Emmaus £t RCIA 
Hey, it's a new year and whether you're a "seasoned" senior, a brand new freshmen or fall somewhere in between, this is a great opportunity to set new goals for yourself. Studying harder, being a better roommate, attending Mass more often, being more patient with your girl/boyfriend, BEATING MICHIGAN (oops, been there, done that!!) or going abroad are all great goals. 
One of the most important goals we can set for ourselves is to expand and deepen the friendships in our lives. Beyond the grades, the great career opportunities and the millions of t-shirts you will accumulate over your four years, the most important part of your college experience that you will take from this sacred place is your FRIENDS: the friends you make in the dorms, on retreats, in your classes and the friends everywhere in between. The people who have shaped us and helped us become who we are is by far the most important gift Notre Dame will give us. 
One opportunity for you to form great friendships is through EMMAUS. Over 200 students participate in this program each semester. These are students from all over campus --different years in school, different ethnic backgrounds, different religious affiliations, different experiences of family and friends. But these students want to put their faith into action beyond a Sunday liturgy and they want to form friendships that matter. Emmaus gives participants opportunities to share what's most important in their lives in light of the Gospel message. 
Emmaus is made up of groups of 6-8 students who come together for 1-1 1/2 hours each week to pray, read Scripture or other spiritual writings, and discuss what is going on in their lives based on the readings. Each Emmaus faith sharing group is student led and all materials are provided by Campus Ministry. There are many types of Emmaus groups: some groups are dorm-based, while others include men and women from across campus. Some students form their won groups, and others decide to let the Holy Spirit (and Campus Ministry) decide who their group members will be. Last year Emmaus even went international. When 4 out of 6 members of one group were all going abroad, they decided to keep connected and e­mailed each other every week with their thoughts on the Sunday Scriptures and their personal experiences. They continued to pray with and for each other even though they were literally oceans and continents apart. 
Yes, Emmaus is about prayer, about faith, about our spiritual journeys. It is also about FRIENDSHIP with Christ and with one another. It's about integrating faith into EVERY aspect of our daily lives and having companions to support and challenge us when we need it most. Some Emmaus groups stick together for all four years and some change every year. All the while, we in Campus Ministry will stick beside you to help meet your needs on your spiritual journey in any way we can. 
It's not too late to set ANY goal for this year, and if "faith & friendship" are something you are looking, give us a try ... the road to Emmaus may be the best goal you have ever set and perhaps the best road you've ever taken!

Examining anti-Americanism 
When I was growing up, it was an article of faith amongst my friends that Americans were incapable of appreciat­ing irony. This dogma was. as far as I can recall, based on nothing that deserves to be dignified with the term evidence, Peter Wicks nothing beyond the fact that it was widely Englishman believed to be so. Other Abroad common knowledge was that Americans were ignorant of the little history they had, and were consequently culturally-deprived and prone to simplistic moral absolutism. It is hard to faithfully recall my boyhood outlook, but I think I shared with my peers a vague intuition that you Yanks might have had a shot at sophistication if only you had been able to grow up in close proximity to castles. 
Having long since accorded Jerry Lewis semi-divine status, the French were in no position to assume the high ground when it came to humor, but the resentment of America's cultural domi­nance plays a far more central role in French self-understanding. The denun­ciation of American 'cultural imperial­ism' is France's true national sport. The pernicious influence of Hollywood and McDonald's are regarded with particu­lar horror. 
I have always been suspicious of the phrase 'cultural imperialism,' the rhetorical force of which relies on the suggestion that the export of American culture is a new variety of the imperial­ism of the Spanish, French and British empires. To hear some people talk you would think that U.S. Marines were currently stationed in Paris. busily frog­marching Frenchmen into the nearest McDonald's. 
I haven't seen "Super Size Me,'' the documentary in which Morgan Spurlock proves beyond all doubt that it is unhealthy to subsist on a diet that consists entirely of fast food. But I am not surprised that it is proving popular

students, but I got the wrong student parking per­mit. 
I'm sure it was my mistake. It must have happened when I paid for my permit at the beginning of the year. I think I just picked up the wrong sticker. I am always doing stupid things like that. But I didn't notice it until this morning when I got to school. 
Like every morning, I pulled into the student lot about 10 minutes before class and started looking for an empty space. I usually park in the southern quadrant of the student lot, but today when I tried to park there, a security guard stopped me. 
"You can't park here," he said. "Oh, I'm sorry," I said, "I must be mistaken.

was in an English bookstore I saw so 
many books about the epidemic of obe­
sity in America that it can only be a 
matter of time before they are consid­
ered a literary genre. 
I am not opposed to the suggestion that obesity can be a sign of cultural sickness, but surely so too is the insa­tiable appetite for voyeuristic accounts of American obesity. 
It seems to me that these are all man­ifestations of a deep cultural insecurity. We want the inhabitants of the world's richest and most powerful country to be fat simpletons who couldn't possibly understand Monty Python because these are our consolations. We want America to be that way for the same reason we want the model to be dumb, the star quarterback to have a drug problem and the successful business­man to have bad dreams. 
I think this helps to explain why the English place so much importance on irony when defending their cultural superiority; it's where we have the most ego invested. It has been said that the distinguishing feature of English men is that they would rather be told that they are bad in bed than that they have no sense of humor. Intrigued by this claim, some years ago I put this to a group of friends back in England and they agreed unanimously -in order to make my survey scientific. I made sure that they were drunk first. 
All of these petty prejudices can be called anti-American, but it would be mistaken to regard any of them as expressing hatred of America. I never hated America and I don't think any my friends did either. But I think the hatred of America does share something in common with my adolescent snobbery; its appeal is the consolation it provides. 
Hatred of America is, I think, far more about America's status as the world's only superpower than it is about what America does with that

Instead, they had Gurley Leep price stickers. I know, I am such an idiot. So if someone in the administration could just send me a Gurley Lnep price sticker so that I can start parking in the student lot. I would appreciate it. Again, I am sorry because this was clearly my mistake.

about America's invasion of Iraq was 
the sense that America would invade

could do to change that. They were .angry because at some level they

Tony Hlair was widely denounced as

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Supporting the Gender Resource Center 
Realistic considerations 

I agree that all people should be treated equally whether they are black or white, gay or straight, and like Anna Nussbaum, men or women, but many of the points in her letter yesterday were not thought through. 
I agree with her that Notre Dame should have more resources available in Health Services for women such as the ability to fill medication that is typically used for birth control -but also for many other things-and assistance in the event they are assaulted, but my agreement ends there. 
Yes, it is annoying that most women's halls have more strict security than men's, but let's be honest, in many cases women need more protection then men. Personally, I even enjoyed having the dorm monitors around when I lived on campus and thought that all dorms should have had them. I know I can take care of myself, but added protection can never hurt. But putting my opinion aside, this security measure is in place in some male dorms too. 
I had to sign in and out of a male dorm this weekend. So there you go, equality. 
As far as adding more graduate pro­grams to Notre Dame, I think that would be great. I would love to come back to Notre Dame to pursue my graduate degree, but saying that stereotypical women's pro­grams like education and nursing should be added sets the women's program· back almost 100 years. Don't get me wrong, they are great careers, but insinuating that they are female oriented not only insults males in these professions, but also insinuates that women cannot hack it in your so­called male oriented professions. 
Finally, change the victory march, the most historied victory march of all time? Knute Rockne is rolling over in his grave. 
While change can be positive, it must be done keeping in mind tradition. If this isn't done, Notre Dame as we know it will cease to exist. Hopefully the Gender Relations Center will keep this in mind and look for important changes rather than getting bogged down in minor details such as a word in a song and thus allow Notre Dame to be lost in political correctness. 
Ellen Fitzgerald alumni Cliss of 2003 Sept.15 

Making progress 
I never thought I'd see the day that I was defending Notre Dame. I am in a state of perpetual frustration about the rules, in loco parentis, and the dif­ferences in the treatment of men and women. 
However, it comes down to the fact that we all chose this school. There are certain things, such as single-sex dorms, meatless Fridays, lack of birth con­trol and the possibility of being expelled for having sex, that have long been a part of Notre Dame. The University has made no attempt to hide these facts. We all knew coming in that this was a strict Catholic University. If you didn't, then I doubt you looked very hard. 
I will admit, I was raised with stories from my parents about Notre Dame glory days when Rectors helped roll kegs down the hall, and parietals were more of a suggestion. But as the daughter of a member of the first class of women, I also heard stories of men rating the bodies of women as they went through the lines in the dining halls and a professor telling students that over his dead body would a woman graduate. 
Notre Dame was a culture shock for me in more ways than those previous­ly listed. But although I did not fully understand the scope of du Lac before arriving on campus, I knew that I was not going to be having the same expe­riences as my friends heading off io Florida and Florida State. And even though I can commiserate with many of Anna Nussbaum's gripes, I think some of her demands are unreasonable. 
She wants males in the student section to stop yelling slurs offensive to women? I do not know where she was sitting, but some of the more abrasive members of the section near me were women who also continually com­mented on the promiscuity of Ann Arbor. And what constitutes offensive lan­guage because I surely wasn't offended, although those affiliated with the University of Michigan may have been. 
I also hate the argument that "women's programs" are not equally repre­sented in our graduate school. What is a "woman's program?" So what if the business school has been "traditionally male." Is that stopping you from pur­suing that career? My mother was a graduate of the business school in '76. 
Yes, there are certain aspects of Notre Dame that are extremely frustrat­ing and more conservative than what are peers are experiencing, but I have decided to focus on the positives. It has taken me two years to come to grips with the fact that the rules based on Catholic belief will never change. So instead of continuing to seethe in anger, I think the best approach to make a difference is to focus on the attitudes and comments of my fellow students. I'm pretty sure that when I come back for the Michigan game years from now, single sex dorms will still be in existence. But perhaps, more impor­tantly, the student body will have continued to evolve as it has since the '70s when the first women stepped on campus.

Rethinking the expiration of the assault weapons ban 
As the federal assault-weapons ban is set to expire this week, the debate on gun control has surged to the forefront of current issues. Leaders in Congress have been locking horns with the gun industry, the NRA has been battling gun control advocacy groups and President Bush has taken a lot of heat for supporting the ban but doing Adam little to renew it. Llchtenheld 
Hecent discussion and deliberation has proved the assault weapon ban The Wisconsin to be virtually nothing more than a Badger Herald Second Amendment issue of extreme proportions; it is difficult to decipher the legitimacy of assault-weapon use in our Bill of Rights. Nevertheless, whether you're a !1annel-wearing, camou!1age-painted, red-necked, gun-toting, conservative card-carrying member of the NRA or a tie-dye wearing, hash-smok­ing, peace-waving, pacifist liberal, you should be able to agree that the assault weapons ban deserves to expire. 
The problem with the revitalization of the ban does not lie in its intentions. There should be little doubt that restricting public access to elaborate assault weapons is in the best interest of our country. There is no reason why hunters or competitive shooters need to use AK­47s-which are designed to kill mass amounts of peo­ple in combat-as opposed to regular rifles and shot­guns-which are designed for hunting and recreation­al activities.. 
The problem with the assault-weapons ban lies in its effectiveness; it is nothing more than a legislative piece of propaganda filled with exceptions and loopholes. The ban does little to stop the circulation of all kinds of dan­gerous assault weapons. 
It is difficult to determine statistically how successful the ban has been since its implementation in 1994. People's definitions of an assault weapons differ, and it is hard to keep track of crimes committed by specific types of guns. A study done by the Justice Department, as reported by the New York Times, found that crimes committed by assault weapons have declined only slightly since the ban took effect. Because of the ban's vagueness and ambiguity, most gun manufacturers have simply changed the names of their weapons or altered their features and accessories to comply with the law. 
This obvious weakness was mocked in one case when a gun maker produced a modified version of an assault weapon and called it AB 10, with the "AB" standing for "after ban." An estimate from the Viole.nce Policy Center claims that, since 1994, more than one million assault weapons have been made in the United States despite the ban. How can a law meant to restrict the buying and selling of specific guns fail to prohibit so many of these weapons from going on the market and into people's homes? And if we know there are ways around the ban, shouldn't its expiration be necessary in order to find a more effective alternative? 
Rather than pushing so hard for the extension of an inadequate law, we should be exploring alternative pieces of legislation that could implement a more effec­tive ban on assault weapons. A prime example is the Consumer Safety Protection Act, which is currently being debated in Congress. The CSPA allows the Justice Department to regulate the manufacture and distribu­tion of weapons, as well as restrict the availability of guns determined to be a risk to public safety (such as assault weapons). 
Such proposed legislation attempts to do what the assault weapons ban was supposed to do: prohibit such unnecessary and dangerous weapons from being pro­duced and distributed to the general public. Through revisions and the closing of loopholes, a new bill could be passed that would be strong where the present ban is weak. 
The assault weapons ban has not done an adequate job of preventing gun enthusiasts from acquiring mor­phed forms of multiple kinds of assault weapons. It did 
-nothing to help prevent such high-profile shootings as the 1999 killings at Columbine High School or the 2002 sniper attacks in Washington, D.C., both cases in which assault weapons we're used. Such guns are made for combat, not hunting; they are unnecessary in the lives of the average citizen. How do we implement laws that recognize the needlessness of assault weapons and the dangers they pose? 
We don't spend valuable time and energy attempting to extend a severely flawed piece of legislation. Through its 10-year life span, the assault-weapons ban proved it was not the answer to gun control, but merely an inconvenience for the gun industry and its con­sumers.

ALBUM REVIEW 

Simpson sister finds success 
By BECCA SAUNDERS Assistant Scene Editor 
What is the secret to a successful first album? Apparently an MTV reality show, a famous older sister and some hair dye ­Ashlee Simpson's recipe for greatness. Add a solid. heavily promoted debut album .hit­ting platinum after only weeks and shoot­ing to number one, and the story of Ashlee Simpson's summer is complete. One of the most-hyped albums of the summer, "Autobiography," Ashlec's debut, has taken thn focus oil' older sister Jessica and blazed a path for the younger Simpson in the music industry. 
Just months ago, Ashlee Simpson was nothing more than a guest star making appearances on "Newlyweds," her sister Jessica Simpson's reality show. She also had a role on WB's "Seventh Heaven," but was not known for much more than her last name. A lot has changed. Following the success of "The Ashlee Simpson Show" on MTV, "Autobiography" became destined for number one. 

More than hair color differentiates Ashlee from Jessica, and "Autobiography" shows that fact explicitly. One would find it difl'icult to draw comparisons between Jessica and Ashlee's albums as they arc so difl'erent from one another. 
"Autobiography" is meant to be a rock album. While it does not quite reach that standard, it definitely falls in between rock and pop. Similar to Avril Lavigne's sound, but not quite as dark in the subject matter, the album showcases a girl with talent and terrific songwriters. While Ashlee doesn't have the strong ballad voice of her sister, her scratchy voice generally works in the pop-rock scene and fits with the songs she performs. The songs are generally upbeat ­-although there are a couple slower tracks -and all are composed of catchy melodies that any teenage girl would have in her head and on her lips for days. 

"Pieces of Me" was the first single off "Autobiography," and at a tempo between fast and slow, with hints of both throughout the song. It was a perfect choice. The sec­ond single that is currently being pushed is "Shadow," which is a slow song about Ashlee living in Jessica's shadow through­out their childhood. Ashlee sings of the angst of growing up as the younger sister: "Living in the shadow/ of someone else's dream I Trying to find a hand to hold, but every touch felt cold to me I Living in a nightmare, a never ending sleep I But now that I am wide awake my chains arc finally free I Don't feel sorry for me." 

Fame has come to Ashlce Simpson and her album "Autobiography," and the main question one cannot help asking is whether or not the album would have been strong enough to stand and rise on its own, inde­pendent of all the support it found. It is a good debut album, but number one is prob­ably something that would have escaped the exact same album done by a girl with­out the last name Simpson. Overall, "Autobiography" is a fun, catchy album that is very likeable. While she does not quite hit her goal for Courtney Love rock. Ashlee stays far away from her sister's sound and in doing so made a great debut album that has made her a name for her.

Gift of Gab is solid, but lacks beats 
By KENYATTA STORIN Assistant Scene Editor 
There is no arguing that Gift of Gab is one of the best underground rap­pers of today. lie and Chief Xcel, who form Blackalicious. have made two of the most creative and unique hip-hop albums in recent memory: "Nia" and "Blazing Arrow." Much like other pre­mier underground acts like Jurassic 5, Common and Talib Kweli, Blackalicious produces an alternative brand of hip hop that strays far from the path of popular rappers like 50 Cent and Snoop Dogg. No guns, no money, no violence here -t-his is intellectual hip-hop at its best. 
But Blackalicious is not only cre­ative, but quite talented as well. Gift of Gab has an unbelievable flow, being able to rap as quickly as Twista while using the vocabulary of a Webster's dictionary and expressing as much spirituality as a Notre Dame Rector. Chief Xcel is no slouch either, sporting some of the most unpredictable and sophisticated beats around, making him and Gift of Gab a perfect pairing. 

"4th Dimensional Rocketships Going Up" is Gift of Gab's first solo release, and although it is a solid effort, Chief Xcel is sorely missed. Production duties are instead split between Vitamin D and Jake One, and the two fail to fill even one of Chief Xcel's shoes. Aside from some bright spots like the opening track, "The Ride of Your Life," which has a surreal harp sample intertwined with a smooth bass line, many of the tracks have generic and static beats. Not only this, but the overall production lacks vari­ety, making some of the songs blend together after a while. This is not to say that the production does not have its moments for some of the beats grow on you over time, but overall it lacks the punch and creativity of Chief Xcel's work. 

On the other hand, Gift of Gab is as good as ever, once again showing why he is one of the best lyricists out there. Sometimes he is insightful, like on "Way of the Light" when~ he spouts, "Money just like everything else, it all dies I The self is lost, and it's still can I get a dime sack? I To help me focus on wealth, not material wealth I Cause true wealth resides deep inside." And like previous Blackalicious works, Gift of Gab shows he can still be quite imaginative too, like on "Stardust" where he flows, "Headed out to Mars with souls and minds that are more connected I build with elders how to conquer ignorance, the mighty predator." 
Due to the mediocrity of the album's production, in order to truly enjoy the album one must listen carefully to Gift of Gab's lyrics. His rhymes are full of clever allusions and thought-provok­ing topics that often take several lis­tens to catch because of his lightening quick flow. Unlike catchy radio-friend­ly songs like Usher's "Yeah!" or 50 Cent's "In Da Club" that are suited well for background music at parties and the like, "4th Dimensional Rocketships Going Up" is a poor choice for a casual listen. It is like the difference between putting on "Kill Bill" or "The Matrix" in the back­ground, versus "2001: Space Odyssey" or "Citizen Kane." 
"4th Dimensional Rocketships Going Up" is a very good hip-hop album, but when compared to Blackalicious, it

Gift of Gab shows off his skills In his solo debut, but his work with Blackallclous Is still better. 
almost sounds pedestrian. It lacks the wonderful chemistry between Gift of 
Gab and Chief Xcel that makes Blackalicious so unique. With the right producers, Gift of Gab is probably capable of creating a classic by him­self. but it is hard to imagine a better producer for him than Chief Xcel. For the time being, Gift of Gab should stick with what works and make another classic Blackalicious album. Then the rocket ships will really 11y.

ALBUM REVIEW 
The Arcade Fire unleash electrifying debut 
By MATTHEW L. SOLARSKI Scene Music Criric 
Jack Kerouac famously wrote, "The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved ... the ones that never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn. burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars ... " Were Jack around today, he would probably have the words "The Arcade Fire" tattooed across his chest inside a big, red heart. 
In the live setting, The Arcade Fire cel­ebrate their madness by painting blood on their faces, shouting in unison and turning anything in the vicinity of the stage into a percussion instrument. Now, with the release of their debut "Funeral," the Montreal-based group have ossified their already-consjderable 
Funeral

Merge 




''''" 
status as one of the most compelling groups making and performing music today. 
The band behind "Funeral," ironically centers on a wedding -that of husband and wife co-vocalists Win Butler and Regine Chassagne. Each also plays a slew of instruments including, but not limit~;Jd to, guitar, piano, accordion, drums. recorder. synthesizer, xylophone and bass. Joining them are Win's broth­er Will, Richard Reed Parry, and Timothy Kingsbury, who together play just about everything and seldom settle for a single instrument for more than two consecutive songs. Rounding out the ever-expanding collective, Montreal stu­dio guru Howard Eilerman rocks the drum kit, looking very much like a librarian, while pixie Sarah Neufeld adds a pinch of gravitas to the songs with her pensive violin. 
A solemn affair this funeral is not: basslines thunder beneath pulsating, jangling guitars. organs and harps galli­vant about dizzying c~imes, strings rise and cascade while a maudlin accordion sobs. Win steps in and lends his sincere, engaging vocals to the mix, at times recalling Frank Black, at times Modest Mouse's Isaac Brock and most often sounding very much like himself. 


The record opens with "Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)." The first of four "Neighborhood" movements, it tingles with a refreshing magic realism. as Win describes a surreal nocturnal journey with his neighbor and beloved. The sec­ond "Neighborhood," "Laika," also examines escape, as Win and Regine recount the exploits of a brother who "tore our images out of his pictures ... scratched our names out of all his let­ters." The accordion figures most sub­limely into this number, which culmi­nates in a line worthy of our man Jack, "When daddy comes home I you always start a fight I so'the neighbors can dance I in the police disco lights." 
As its centerpiece, "Funeral" boasts the exceedingly gorgeous "Wake Up," an anthem to the despairing and disheart­ened. A rich, six-note guitar riff with grace note explodes into a chanted cho­rus featuring all band members. adorned in dashing harps and lush strings. The ebullient, supremely cathar­tic song finds Win and company at its end proclaiming, "With my lightnin' bolts a glowin' I I can see where I am goin' I You better look out below!" 
Having resolved to dive headlong into whatever sabotages life puts before them, the Arcade Fire prance through

two more stellar tracks before at last arriving at the eulogy-like closer "In the Backseat." ''I've been learning to drive all my life," declares Regine.

Nelly goes all out with new releases 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -As he tried to slip in a side door before a recent performance, Nelly got accosted by a fan waiting for his arrival. 
Nothing unusual -except the fan just happened to be uber-hip singer-song­writer John Mayer. 
"Hey Nelly, can I come in with you?" Mayer asked the rap superstar after an embrace. Nelly gave security the O.K., and his posse -which already included Murphy Lee, the rest of his St. Lunatics crew and Jermaine Dupri -grew by one. Later on, P. Diddy joined Nelly onstage for the Webster Hall perform­ance. broadcast live for America Online in front of hundreds of screaming fans. 
Everyone wants to be part of Nelly's clique these days -and who can blame them? The man who put St. Louis on the map has sold an astonishing 15 mil­lion copies of his first two albums, and on Tuesday released not one, but two separate albums -"Sweat" and "Suit" -on the same day. One is more of a party ~isc reminiscent of hits like "Hot in Herre," while the other has smoother songs that recall the smash success of "Dilemma." 
Not only does he have musical suc­cess, his Pimp Juice energy drink is a hot commodity, he's got his own cloth­ing lines and is filming his second film -a remake of "The Longest Yard" with Chris Rock and Adam Sandler. 
Q: These albums have so many col­laborations, but the most unusual is country singer Tim McGraw. How did that come about? 
NELLY: I used to see Tim a lot as far as like going around for awards shows, when "Country Grammar" first came out, him and his wife Faith. They would just tell me how they enjoyed my album. and everything I was doing. And you know how that old saying goes ­"Yo, we should do something." 
Q: Could you ever do a country song·! 
NELLY: Nah, nah. It wasn't like that. It was just me being me, pushing the limits. 
Q: What was your reaction when Spelman College students protested your appearance there to promote bone marrow donation because of your explicit "Tip Drill" video, in which you swiped a credit card through a woman's backside? 
NELLY: To me. it was a personal attack. It couldn't have been about what they said it was, because if it truly was, and this is truly your view, you're basically cutting the grass at the top instead of diggin' up for the roots, because Spelman is 10 blocks from a strip club. You're not out in front of the strip club picketing. You wait until somebody comes in there and does something very dear to his heart, such as saving a life, and doing something that should be educating the communi­ty, to come in and talk about a video? 
Q: Would you ever do another "uncut" video? 
NELLY: If I wanted to. yes, because I don't see anything wrong with it. Like I said before, it was made for adults. I do stuff for the adults but I also do stuff that appeals to kids. So, I try to keep a fine line. Hopefully, parents raise their kids and don't let music raise their kids and entertainers raise their kids. How is it that I can keep my child from see· ing a video that I did, but you can't keep your child (from seeing it) and you're there a lot more than I am? So you can't be serious. 

Q: What everyone really wants to know is ... was that really your credit card? 
NELLY: Yeah, that was my credit card! That's the thing. I think everybody is most upset about the credit card issue, but she said do it! This is a grown woman that told me, "Go ahead, do it." I never forced any of these girls to do anything. This is a job, they agreed to do it, they knew everything that was into it and these girls would be doing it whether Nelly was shooting a video or not. 
Q: You recently joined BET founder Bob Johnson as part owner of the NBA's Charlotte Bobcats. Will you have clout to say, "Hey, you need to trade this guy?" 
NELLY: [Laughs] Yeah, yeah -I think in a minute he's going to be second guessing his decision, because you know, I'm a sports nut. I'm always in it. I'm aware, and I have many friends who are athletes. I think sports and entertainment go hand in hand. I defi­nitely want to voice my opinion. But I'm just appreciative that I'm in this posi­tion. 
Q: You got some criticism for naming your energy drink Pimp Juice. 
NELLY: I don't think they understand. They hear the word, and they think, "Oh, my goodness," but you're not protesting Coke and Pepsi, and they have caffeine and stuff that is addictive and stuff that can harm you if you drink that. Pimp Juice has none of that. It's good for them. Sometimes you have to wrap it up in bad so they can get the good out of it. If you understand me, it's not even my angle. My son might come in and get two As and a B. and be like, "Man, I pimped that test!" ... It's just different these days, it's just lingo, it's just slang. 
Q: How do you respond when people say you're not a role model? 
NELLY: I don't see myself as a role model. I see myself as an inspiration. I can be an inspiration for someone who's been in the situation that I've been in and making good out of it. A role model should be someone who's close to you, someone who you can pick up and call when you're about to do something stupid or you have a ques­tion about life ... A role model should be some person who you can actually see the role of their life. You can't do that with athletes and entertainers, so I don't know why people just insist on making us role models. We'-re success stories.

"It wasn't pretty, but (it was) a good win for the team," Millar said. Cleveland 5, Detroit 3 
Ben Broussard cleared his head, then cleared the bases. 
Broussard's two-out, two-run double sparked a three-run eighth inning, sending the Cleveland Indians to a win over the Detroit Tigers. 
"I just tried to clear my mind and go up there with a pur­pose," said Broussard, who was mired in a 3-for-34 slump in September. "Thoughts shoot through your head, so the best thing to do is take a deep breath." 
Broussard pulled the first pitch he saw from Esteban Yan (2-4) just inside the first-base bag to put Cleveland ahead 4-3. Ryan Ludwick followed with an RBI double that was inches fair down the left-field line to make it 5-3. 
Broussard came on as a defensive replacement in the seventh for the Indians, who snapped a three-game losing streak and won for just the fourth time in 12 games.

Matt Riley pitched well after taking a ball off his face -just not well enough to win. 
Riley took a one-hopper off his jaw and collapsed after his second pitch of the game in Baltimore's loss to the Toronto Blue Jays. 
Riley laid on the mound for a few minutes, but stayed in the game, allowing two hits and seven walks in seven innings. 
"It kind of shocked me when it hit me. It jarred my brain," Riley said. "It just took me a couple of pitches afterward to gather everything together and get back on track." 
Toronto's Reed Johnson led off the first with a sharp grounder that bounced off the jaw of Riley, who went down in a heap. Johnson reached on the single. 
Riley recovered, but issued two walks and threw a wild pitch before the inning was over. After play resumed, Chris Woodward walked and Vernon Wells grounded into a double play. Riley (1-4) then walked Carlos Delgado before a wild pitch allowed Johnson to score from third. 
"You have to shake something like that off," Riley said. "We're out there playing a game and my teams needs me."

and I get the best out of you, then it will come together as a team effort that could be brilliant." 
The best illustration is the rare tack Sutton is taking this week. 
Captains usually have a good idea about teams midway through the week and start put­ting those players together dur­ing practice so they can get comfortable with each other. 
Sutton is keeping his guys in the dark. From the time his 12­man team was finalized on Aug. 16 until sometime before open­ing ceremonies Thursday, the American players will not get the slightest hint whom their partners will be. 
And Sutton's pairings during the practice rounds don't offer much of a clue. 
Tiger Woods played Tuesday with Jim Furyk, Chris Riley and Chad Campbell, all of whom have been linked as possible partners. The next day, Woods went off in a twosome with Ryder Cup rookie Chris DiMarco. Bringing up the rear was a fivesome -another Ryder Cup rarity -of Davis Love III, Jay Haas, Fred Funk, Campbell and Furyk. 
"I told them I wasn't going to set the pairings for the practice rounds," Sutton said. "Be pre­pared to beat the other two guys by yourself, and if I give you a little help, that's a bonus. So they have no clue who they're going to play with. If they know who it is, they start worrying about their partner's game instead of worrying about their own game." 
Sutton said his lineup for the opening round is set. He will let the players know during the final day of practice, and some

"This is certainly a different strategy, something I've never experienced," Woods said. "I think it's refreshing. We go out there and prepare like we always do for each and every tournament, and they when your name is called, you go out there and try to get a point." 
Woods was given that freedom to stick to his routine at The Belfry in 2002, when he angered the British media and public for playing his practice round before the gates were opened, just like he does at the majors. 
And that's why none of Mickelson's teammates were disturbed when he took the day off.

De La Hoya grim. but confident about chances with Hopkins 


Winner will claim $30 million payday

LAS VEGAS -The smile was gone, and Oscar De La Hoya was in no mood to play any games. To those who think he has no chance against mid­dleweight champion Bernard Hopkins, though, De La Hoya had something to say.

fighter. No, he didn't take the fight just for a $30 million pay­day. 
And, yes, he does have a plan to win. 
"The reason I took this fight is I know I can win," De La Hoya said Wednesday. ''I'm not thinking of anything else because all I want is those belts. Believe me when I tell you, those belts are mine." 
For the first time in his career, De La Hoya will be an underdog when he goes into the ring Saturday night to challenge Hopkins in a fight that could end up the richest non-heavyweight bout ever. 
It's only the second fight at middleweight for De La Hoya, and he's taking on a champion who has defended his titles 18 times and hasn't lost in 11 years. 
Perhaps that's why the usual smile was missing at Wednesday's final pre-fight press conference, replaced by a grimly determined boxer who knows what part this fight will play when it's time to eval­uate his extraordinarily lucra­tive career. 

"This is the fight where I just suck it up and let everything loose," De La Hoya said. "This is for all the marbles. This is the fight that will define my career." 
For Hopkins, it's a fight that means even more than that. 
''I'm willing to leave my soul, body and life in there if it takes that," Hopkins

hungry fight­er every time. 
Hopkins is a 2-1 favorite in the scheduled 12-round fight, which will be televised on pay­per-view (HBO, $54.95) from the MGM Grand Garden arena. Already a sellout with a $14 million gate, promoters are hoping the matchup is so intriguing that it will surpass the previous non-heavyweight record of 1.4 million pay-per­view buys set in De La Hoya's 1999 fight with Felix Trinidad. 
If the fight sells as well as expected, the 39-year-old Hopkins 
could pocket "I'm going to set a fierce pace. It's going up to $15 to be a Marvin

career has been marked by battles with various pro­moters and managers, the money is vindication for doing things his own way. 
"We've got two different agendas, come from two dif­ferent places and have walked two different roads," said Hopkins (44-2-1, 31 knock­outs). "He's the golden boy, but after Saturday night I'll be the new golden boy." 
De La Hoya, who has won titles in five weight divisions from 130 pounds up, will have to show not only that he can be quicker than Hopkins but also that he has the stamina to stay on his toes all 12 rounds. 
That's been a problem in previous fights, including his loss to Trinidad, where he was ahead after nine rounds but then ran the last three rounds. 
De La Hoya 
(37-3, 29 knock­
outs) said he 
sparred 130 
"Stamina is not 
going to be an 

issue," he said. "Stamina is covered, speed is covered, legs are covered. Power? It will come, too." 
Hopkins said De La Hoya had better be prepared to fight from the first round on. Though some have tried to compare the fight to the 1987 middleweight title bout between Sugar Ray Leonard and Marvelous Marvin Hagler, Hopkins said the better analo­gy would be Hagler's third­round knockout of Thomas 
Hearns in 1985. 
''I'm going to

The huge pay­

outs to both fighters is a testament to the continued ability of De La Hoya to draw paying fans despite losing two fights to Shane Mosley and his fight to Trinidad. In his last fight in June against Felix Sturm, he looked out of shape and strug­gled to get a narrow win. 
De La Hoya remains the biggest draw in boxing, with his fights on pay-per-view tak­ing in $390 million exclusive of live gates. Because he is the prime attraction, he refused a ­third fight with Mosley because Mosley wanted a dol­lar more than what De La Hoya would make and turned instead to a much riskier fight with a champion many rate among the best middleweights 
ever. ­Hopkins said he doesn't begrudge De La Hoya his place in boxing. "Oscar is good for boxing. 
Unfortunately we don't have five or six of him," Hopkins said. "Oscar brings a crowd, 
movie stars, celebrities. I have nothing to say bad about Oscar, period."

NHL 


Associated Press 
NEW YORK -The National Hockey League is locking out its players starting Thursday. threat­ening to keep the sport off the ice for the entire 2004­05 season and perhaps beyond in an effort by management to gain mas­sive change in the sport's economic structure. 
After the long-expected decision was approved unanimously Wednesday by NHL owners, commis­sioner Gary Bettman repeatedly belittled the union's bargaining posi­tion, talked about the pos­sibility the confrontation could extend into the 2005-06 season and said the conflict has jeopard­ized the NHL's participa­tion in the 2006 Winter Olympics. 

"If there's enough time to play some games, we'II do it," he said of this sea­son, "and if there's not, we won't." 
Bettman called it a "bleak day," claimed teams had combined to lose more than $1.8 billion over 10 years and cited bankrupt­cy filings by teams in Buffalo. Los Angeles. Ottawa and Pittsburgh. He said management will not agree to a labor deal that doesn't include a defined relationship between rev­enue and salaries. 
"Until he gets off the salary-cap issue, there's 
not a chance for us to get an agreement," union head Bob Goodenow said in Toronto, adding that players "are not prepared to entertain a salary cap in any way, shape, measure or form." 
Far apart on both philos­ophy and finances, the side haven't bargained since last Thursday and say they are entrenched for the long run. echoing words of baseball players and owners at the start of their disastrous 7 1/2­month labor war of 1994­95. 
There is almost no chance the season will start as scheduled on Oct. 13, and Bettman told teams to release their are­nas for other events for the next 30 days. Bettman said the season can't extend past June, and the lockout threatens to wipe out the Stanley Cup final for the first time since 1919. when the series between Montreal and Seattle was stopped after five games due a Spanish influenza epidemic. 
"The union is trying to win a fight. hoping that the owners will give up. That will turn out to be a terri­ble error in judgment," Bettman said. "They are apparently convinced that come some point in the season, the owners' resolve will waver, and I'm telling you that is wrong, wrong, wrong." 
IN BRIEF Battered A's fan defends 
heckling, plans to sue 
OAKLAND, Calif. -The woman whose nose was broken when Texas reliever Frank Francisco threw a chair into the stands said Wednesday she will not decide whether to sue the Rangers until after prosecutors and baseball officials complete their investigation. 
Jennifer Bueno, 41, with a large white bandage covering her nose and purple rings under her eyes, and her husband, Craig, appeared at a news conference with their attorney, who said they plan to seek compensation for her injuries. 
Craig Bueno acknowledged that, before the fracas, he was part of some "verbal bantering" with the Rangers. 
"It's part of going to the baseball game," Jennifer Bueno said. "I don't think he did anything wrong." 
"It's an American tradition," the 42­year-old fire battalion chief said of his heckling, adding that he said he and his wife bought season tickets near the visitors' bullpen just "so we can ~et on them on a little bit." Johnson blows Carlton's 

lefty record away 
PHOENIX -Randy Johnson got his 4,137th strikeout Wednesday night, breaking Steve Carlton's major league record for left-banders and moving into third place overall on the career list. 
Johnson struck out Colorado's Vmny Castilla in the seventh inning, giving the Arizona ace nine in the game and a major league-best 266 this season. 
Play was interrupted momentarily while the scoreboard flashed the sta­tistics and the crowd cheered the workhorse of their struggling team. Despite Johnson's big night. the paid attendance was announced as 22,598 -the second-lowest ever at Bank One Ballpark. 
The only pitchers still ahead of the Big Unit are right-handers Nolan Ryan (5,714) and Roger Clemens (4,287), who is still pitching for the Houston Astros. Howe fired, to remain for 
remainder of season 
NEW YORK -Art Howe was fired as manager of the struggling New York Mets on Wednesday, but decided to honor general manager Jim Duquette's request to stay in the dugout for the rest of the year. 
"The fact is, I'm not fired now. I'm leaving after the season," Howe said. 'Tm not a quitter." 
"You see it happen to other people," he said. "You always hope it doesn't happen to you." 
Howe's contract runs through the 2006 season and he's still owed $4.7 million. But with the Mets at 63-82 _ following a 66-95 finish last year in his first season. Duquette decided it was time for a change. 
"I don't want to get into an evalua­tion of Art," Duquette said. "It wasn't working."

SAN ANTONIO Unheralded Tommy Armour III came into the Texas Open a season ago and broke a PGA scoring record for his first victory in 13 years.

him. 
''I've always played it fairly decent," said Armour, who shot a 26-under 254 last year to win by seven strokes over Loren Roberts and Bob Tway. "Why, I don't know." 
The 72-hole score was the lowest in a PGA tournament, surpassing Mark 
Calcavecchia's 256 in the 2001 Phoenix Open. 
Also part of this year's field when the tournament starts Thursday will be Roberts, the winner in 2002, and two­time champion Justin Leonard, a runner-up in the 2004 PGA Championship. 
In addition to his two Texas Open victories, Leonard has two second-place finishes and is the tournament's lead­ing money winner with $1.3 
million. 
"I'm kind of relaxed when I get here," s a i d Leonard, a Dallas native a n d University of Texas alumnus. "Some

tournaments just have that feel to it, and this is one of them." 
The tournament is notice­ably short on big names, with many taking part this weekend in Ryder Cup play at Oakland Hills in Michigan 

and others taking the week­end off. 
Only three players in the $3.5 million event have tour victories this season and just a handful are among the leading money winners. 
Jerry Kelly, ranked 28th with nearly $1.7 million in prize money, tops the list. 
Players with tour victories this year include Rod Pampling, winner of The International; Vaughn Taylor, who won a four-man playoff in the Reno-Tahoe Open; and Heath Slocum, who tri­umphed at the Chrysler Classic of Tucson. 
Also in the field is England's Justin Rose, who had been in contention for a spot on Europe's Ryder Cup team. 
On Sunday he shot a final­round 63 to climb into a tie for fourth in the Canadian Open. 
"That's huge going into a week like this, which I believe is a pretty low-scor­ing week," said Rose, who has won $1.1 million this year. 
"''ve just got to do my best to stay patient and get out of my own way."

NCAA FOOTBALL 
Tar Heels face early defensive struggles 
Associated Press 
CHAPEL HILL, N.C. -North Carolina's defense is getting pretty good at being bad. 
After two games, the Tar Heels rank last in the Atlantic Coast Conference in every defensive category, and they very well might break the school record for yards allowed. That mark goes all the way back to 2003. 
"We know that we need to improve significantly defen­sively," coach John Bunting said Tuesday. 
No kidding. 

North Carolina gave up 549 yards in a 56-24 loss to Virginia, a week after Division I-AA William & Mary piled up 442 yards. At least the Tar Heels beat the Tribe, rallying for a 10-point deficit in the third quarter to give Bunting his first victory in an opener. 
The Tar Heels haven't dis­criminated very much, either. They've allowed opponents to run and to throw virtually at will while giving up 495.5 yards, about 10 yards less than they did last season. 
They haven't had an inter­ception in nearly a year, dating back to Sept. 20, 2003, against Wisconsin. 
"Absolutely, I can't imagine that. I really can't," Bunting said. "We're not going to get a 
lot of interceptions until we stop the running game. 
In order to get interceptions, you have to get the other team to throw more than they want." 
This from a program that produced a bevy of NFL defenders in the late 1990s and early 2000s _ Ore' Bly, Greg Ellis, Brian Simmons, Julius Peppers and Ryan Sims, just to name a few. 
North Carolina simplified its defensive schemes in the off­season and hired two new coordinators, John Gutekunst from South Carolina and Marvin Sanders from Nebraska. So far, it's only been simple to the opponent. 
Four different running backs totaled seven touchdowns for the Cavaliers, who didn't punt until the fourth quarter. 
Particularly frustrating for Bunting was a play late in the second quarter, when Virginia decided to go for it on fourth­and-1 from their own 30. Sure, the Cavaliers led 28-10 at the time, but it still was a risky call. 
Alvin Pearman made it pay off, running for 7 yards. 
"Schematically, we played that absolutely perfect," Bunting said. "But the corner­back doesn't come up and sup­port. If he does, it's a 2-yard loss."

NFL 

Rivalry growing between Colts and Titans in AFC South 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS The Indianapolis Colts measured themselves against the Super Bowl champions last week. 
This week's game at Tennessee is much more signifi­cant to the Colts (0-1). 
"This one is a lot bigger," tight end Marcus Pollard said Wednesday. "It's really worth two points because you can win on the road and you can win in the division." 
The Colts want to make an early-season impression this week in what has become their biggest rivalry. 
After losing 27-24 at New England on national television last Thursday, Indianapolis wants to prove to the football world that it hasn't taken a stop back this year. 
It's also about necessity. Another Colts loss would give Tennessee a two-game lead in what many consider a two-team division race and would assure the Titans (1-0) of no worse than a split in the season series -the first determinant in breaking a tie. 
Perhaps that's why playoff talk has already seeped into the locker room comments less than two weeks into the regular season. 
"They have something to provo, we have something to prove and the winner of this division has to go through one of these teams," safety Cory Bird said. "So it will be a fierce competition." 
During the past two years, the Titans-Colts matchup has devel­oped into one of the league's most underrated rivalries. No, it's not Giants-Eagles, Packers­Vikings or even Steelers­Browns. 
But it is almost no-holds­barred, and this week, the NFL's standard talking points ­respect the foe, focus on the next game and say nothing to rile an opponent -has taken a back seat to championship aspi­rations and pride. 

"You pretty much have to go out, hit them in the mouth and come out on top," cornerback Nick Harper said. "It's pretty much like a college rivalry but on a different level because there's so much at stake." 
For the two teams that have clearly been the class of the South, much is already at stake. 
When Tennessee swept the series two years ago, it won the division title. When the Colts returned the favor last year, they claimed the division crown. 
Hound 3 starts Sunday with a fervor usually reserved for late­season games. 
"You need several compo­nents to have a rivalry," Tennessee coach Jeff Fisher said. "Typically one is based on proximity and then, of course, the other is based on the com­petition and everything associ­ated with that." 
The difference in this budding 

rivalry is that the teams respect Steve McNair during February's each another. Pro Bowl, a bond between tho Peyton Manning said he two quarterbacks who shared 
developed a friendship with last year's MVP honors.

Replacing Manning isn't easy for Ole Miss 
Michael Spurlock, who replaced Ell Manning at quarterback for Ole Miss, has yet to post a win for the Rebels.

Cutliffe now has worst passing team in SEC 
Associated Press 

JACKSON, Miss. -The last time Mississippi coach David Cutcliffe replaced a quarter­back named Manning, he won a national championship as Tennessee's offensive coordi­nator. This time, he'd probably settle for a victory. 
Accustomed to being the best passing team in the Southeastern Conference with Eli Manning running the offense, the Hebels are the league's worst this season -a major reason why Ole Miss (0­
2) is one loss from its worst 
start in 21 years. "It's pretty obvious that we 
:; 

are disappointed with our pro­duction in that area," Cutcliffe said. "It's frustrating because we haven't accomplished much in the passing game.... We haven't given up on the sit­uation and don't think we are going to stop throwing the football." 
Cutcliffe praised Micheal Spurlock's mobility and exu­berance all preseason, then benched him midway through his second start last week against Alabama. Gangly sophomore Ethan Flatt came off the bench and sparked a quarterback controversy when he threw the Rebels' only touchdown pass of the season, then earned the probable start Saturday against Vanderbilt. 
The Hebels' questions at quarterback sharply contrast 
Cutcliffe's situation in 1998, when as offensive coordinator at Tennessee he won the national title after Tee Martin replaced Peyton Manning. 
Two games into the post-Eli era at Ole Miss, finding an effective replacement for the Ileisman Trophy finalist has been a much tougher chal­lenge. 
Eli Manning broke or tied 45 school records during his four years in Oxford, and directed a passing game which aver­aged 286 yards per game last year. 
"He left some big shoes to fill, and I think a lot of people placed so much pressure on Micheal early," Flatt said. "As far as our offense, it's been lit­tle things -a bad decision or a dropped ball or a penalty."

Belles 
continued from page 24 
fielder Ashley Hinton evened the game later in the first half off an assist from Carrie Orr. Thanks to an assist from Orr, Hinton scored on a corner kick to tie it 1-1 at the end of the first period. 
Luckily for the Belles, the rest of the game was a much different story. 
"We were a little shaky in the first half, especially after they scored their first goal," Orr said. "But we came back out in the second half and set­tled down. Everyone did a really good job of getting their heads back into the game and just playing good soccer." 
In the final period, the score remained tied until Jen Concannon buried a cross from Carolyn Logan for her third goal this season. Logan would also assist Katie Noble for an insurance goal late in the game. 
Logan helped add to the lead again soon after with an assist to Katie Noble for a goal that put the Belles up 3-1, completing a second-half turn­around which saw Saint Mary's play with much more team chemistry. 
"We played really well together. Kalamazoo chal­lenged us, but we knew we just had to get back into our own game," goalie Laura Heline said. "They were very physical, but we came back in the second half and played them hard." 
Heline credited much of the team's success to their defen­sive effort. 
The Observer+ SPORTS 


"Our defense is stellar," she said. ''I'm so glad to have who I have in front of me. I never have to worry about whether they will play well, because they always do." 
Strong games from Katie Taylor and Shannon Culbertson allowed the defense to keep the ball in Kalamazoo's zone for nearly the entire second half. Shutting down their oppo­nent's scoring opened up plen­ty of opportunities for the Belles' offense. 
"Our defense does a great job of feeding the long ball to our forwards, which creates scoring opportunities," Heline said. "This team works well together, we have a lot of team unity." 
Team chemistry has been one of the many things this year that has kept Saint Mary's a step ahead of their opponents. 
"We played well as a team, especially in terms of playing off each other, knowing where every one is going to be, and playing as a unit," Orr said. "Everyone stepped it up when they needed to." 
The improvements in the team's all-around play have allowed them to be much more competitive in the MIAA than in the past. 

"Kalamazoo has always been a big game for us," Orr said. "In years past, they've beaten us badly. This was a great way to start off. It pre­pares us for when we travel to Kalamazoo to play them, and it sets the tone for the sea­son." 
Like all the players, Heline has her sights set on MIAA glory. 
"It was awesome to start 2-0 in the MIAA," she said. "We set our goal high; our goal is to win a MIAA championship, and we're on our way."

Barbour 
continued from page 24 
Barbour began her career in col­legiate athletics as the head field hockey and assistant lacrosse coach at the University of Massachusetts in 1981. Since then, she has been the assistant athletic director at Northwestern University and the associate athlet­ic director Tulane University. 
At Tulane, Barbour also worked for White, who was Tulane's ath­letic director at the time. When White left, she was named the ath­letic director at Tulane. 
During her three years there, she Tulane won 12 conference champi­onships. White had nothing but good things to say about Barbour. 
"As a consummate communica­tor, Sandy will engage the multiple constituencies, by way of creating a 'tomorrow' for Cal that is consis­tent with both the institutional mission and the highest intercolle­giate athletics expectations," White said. 
At Notre Dame. Barbour over­sees facilities and event operations for the 26 sports of the Irish. She also is responsible for football game management and the University's two golf courses. Barbour also had the task of facili­tating the plans of Notre Dame's $22 million. 100,000-square foot Guglielmino Center. which is set to be complete by June 2005. 
White thinks that Barbour will be a perfect lit at the University of California. 
"Simply said, Sandy Barbour is a great fit at Cal -and Berkeley is the perfect place for Sandy," White said.

Football

Braylon Edwards caught 12 passes but no touchdowns. Freshman quarterback Chad Ilenne often had to throw under­neath to receivers much like 
Quinn  had  done  the  week  
before.  
"We  held  them  without  a  

touchdown until that last drive," strong safety Tom Zbikowski said. "So if all you can do is kick field goals ... " 
The sentence finishes itself. 
Zbikowski [four tackles] and free safety Quentin Burrell [sixl. along with Jackson [five] and cornerback Dwight Ellick [six]. combined Saturday to support the efforts of their front seven. 
"I think we played more sound football against Michigan," Jackson said. "We were a lot more disciplined, [and! we attacked the ball more when it was in the air. We actually played more like the wide receivers when the ball was in the air, and I don't think we did that in the first game." 
Zbikowski got the start against BYU and Michigan after pre­game releases showed senior Lionel Bolen as the starter with Freddie Parish as his back-up. Zbikowski is perhaps the most pleasant surprise in the defen­sive backfield. 
"Tommy has performed well for us," defensive backs coach Steven Wilks said. "lie has things to learn, but I am truly pleased with the way he has played." 
Seniors Carlos Campbell and Mike Hichardson enter the game in nickel and dime situations to aid the pass coverage, but the leadership for the secondary exists in the starting rotation. 
"[Preston Jackson] is a true leader. not only with the second­ary but the defense as a whole," Wilks said. "lie's a smart football player. lie puts himself in posi­tion to make plays. I'm waiting to see him continue being the type of.!"ootball player I know he can be. 
Jackson scored on an intercep­tion return against BYU late in the game to give the Irish a chance, and he continued to step in front of passes last weekend to end plays and drives. 
"I worked hard this spring ... and summer to get myself faster and stronger and get in better position to make plays," Jackson said. 
Though the secondary receives due recognition for its perform­ance against Michigan, the freshman Henne did not test Burrell and the corners down­field like BYU was able to do. Michigan State could try to exploit the most likely weakness in an otherwise improved defen­sive backfield. 
"That's one of the things we emphasize and we work on each day in practice is playing the deep ball, putting ourselves in position to make a play on the deep ball," Wilks said. "It's a concern, but it's something that's not a worry. We put ourselves in good positions at times ... we just have to make a play on the ball when we're in the air." 
The win against Michigan somewhat redeems the week one letdown for the players. but that docs not change prepara­tion for a Michigan State team that always is ready for Notre Dame. 
"Our guys understand this is one win," Wilks said. "Nothing that we did last week is going to help us win this week. We have to play to the level of our compe­tition and do the things we know how to do to win this football game."

Hoosier forward Brian Plotkin slotted home the insurance goal on a fast break to bump the Hoosier lead to 2-0 and effectively ice the match for Indiana. 
"We were pushing to win the game," Clark said. "We didn't come here just to make up the numbers. We got caught in transi­tion, but they're a very good team." 
The Irish nearly knotted the game at 1-1 with 15 minutes remaining when forward Justin McGecney got his head on a free kick, yet was denied by Indiana goalkeeper Jay Nolly on a spectac­ular save. 
Nolly stopped four shots on the night while Sawyer blocked three for the Irish. 
"Their goalkeeper came up big a couple times," Clark said. "We did enough in many ways to get more than we did from tonight's game, but that's the way it works." 
McGeeney paced the Irish attack, recording three shots, while fellow forward Tony Megna took a pair of his own.

Spom Editor 
After serving Notre Dame since 2000, Anne "Sandy" Barbour, deputy director of ath­letics has been named the ath­letic director at the University of California. Berkeley, Hobert J. Birgeneau, Chancellor Designate of the University of California announced Wednesday.

MEN'S SOCCER 
senior athletic administrator under Athletic Director Kevin White since July 2003. 
"Unequivocally, Sandy Barbour is truly one of the brightest professionals within the intercollegiate athletics sub­sector," White said in a release Wednesday. "Sandy is also instinctively empathetic, inordi­nately task-oriented, adaptable beyond. her peers, and most· importantly, extremely passion­ate about facilitating stude·nt­athlete aspirations." 
At the University of California, Barbour will oversee 27 sports with an annual budget of approximately $40 million. 

"Cal represents everything that's right with higher educa­tion and intercollegiate athlet­ics," Barbour said at a media conference Wednesday. "I am thrilled and flattered to be given this opportunity. This is what I have been working toward my entire life. It's a dream come true, both personally and pro­fessionally."

Irish fall in second half to No. 1 Ind.iana 
By MATT PUGLISI Sports Writer 

Looks can be deceiving, and such was the case for Indiana's 2-0 vic­tory over Notre Dame on Wednesday night. 
The score did not reflect the tenacity of the No. 5 Irish, who dropped to 3-1-1 as No. 1 Indiana rode a pair of second half tallies to improve to 5-0-0. 
After the game, coach Bobby Oark remained optimistic. 
"There were more positives in a funny way than negatives," Clark said. "It's nice to come in against the No. 1 team in the country and play an even game. We didn't win, but we certainly played a very good game." 
Despite having trouble stringing together passing plays, the Irish had their chances to establish a lead in the first half. In the ninth minute of play, defender Jack Stewart wove through the Indiana defense until the Hoosiers wern able to clear the ball out of their dangnr zmw. 
AftPr a scoreless lirst half. the lloosiers drew first blood at the 
53:15 mark when a shot from Indiana forward Jacob Peterson ricocheted oil' St1~wart's !iJOt, past goalkeeper ChrLs Sawyer and into the back of the net for a 1-0 Indiana advantage. 
"The lad came in from the right. and [the Indiana forwards) played a nice little combination," Clark said. "It was very·well taken -a good shot taken just inside the box." 
The Irish remained fierce on the field, refusing to bow to the defend­ing national champions. In particu­lar, Joe Lampira continued to put pressure on the lloosier.defense after the hal!time break. 
Determined to deliver the equal­izer, the Irish pushed up, only to get burned with just under 10 min-

Belles remain undefeated, improve to 2-0 in MIAA 
By RYAN DUFFY Sports Writer 
Facing their first real confer­ence challenge, the Belles con­tinued to show that they'll give everything they have to· reach their goal -an MIAA champi­onship. 
Saint Mary's took another step toward its final destination Wednesday, posting a 3-1 win over Kalamazoo in its home conference opener. The win kept the Belles tmdefeated in MlAA play and extended their overall record to 3-0. 
The Belles fell behind early in the first half, with Kalamazoo scoring to make it 1-0 and play­ing a physical game that seemed to give Saint Mary's trouble. But sophomore mid-

Notre Dame has given up 78 rushing yards in two games, and the Irish are only 1-1. But no cause for despair exists on the defense after handing defeat to No. 8 Michigan. 
After surrendering big pass­ing plays to Brigham Young, the secondary has fed off a hungry line and linebacking core to already make evident improvements. 
''I'd give us a B-minus," cor­nerback Preston Jackson said. "We struggled a few times the first game, but we bounced back and made some plays. In the second game, we were get­ting better and better. And as long as we correct our mis­takes and gain some confi­dence, I expect we'll be an A­plus by the end of the season."
