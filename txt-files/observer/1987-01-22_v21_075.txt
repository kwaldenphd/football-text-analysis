Reagan scheduled to meet with panel 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -A commis­sion investigating U.S. arms sales to Iran and National Se­curity Council operations on Wednesday nailed down an ap­pointment with President Reagan and won three more weeks to finish its work. 
While the panel headed by former Sen. John Tower inter­viewed former President Jimmy Carter in Plains, Ga., White House spokesman Larry Speakes revealed that Reagan will meet with the commission next Monday. 
Speakes said Reagan is ex­pected to review White House files with counsel Peter J. Wal­lison before the session with Tower and two other panel members, former Secretary of 
State Edmund S. Muskie and 
former  national  security  ad­ 
viser Brent Scowcroft.  
Reagan is  expected  to  an­ 

swer panelists' questions a~out his recollections of how the pro­gram of clandestine arms sales program transpired, Speakes said. 
The three-member board was named by the president on Dec. 1 -less than a week after Attorney General Edwin Meese III revealed that some proceeds from the arms sales had been diverted to Nicaraguan rebels. It was di­rected to report by Jan. 29 on the role of the National Secur­ity Council staff in carrying out sensitive diplomatic and intel­ligence missions such as the se­cret arms deals.

P&GRep. talks about Diaper Race 
By JIM RILEY Assistant News Editor 
The story of Pampers turnaround, "The Great Diaper Race," was pre­sented by Richard Nicolosi, vice president of the paper products division of Proctor and Gamble. 
Nicolosi gave an hour-long presentation which com­bined lecture with slides and videotapes Wednesday night before a filled auditorium at the Center for Continuing Education. 
Nicolosi said he wanted to 
"share perspectives and un­
derstandings about what the 
business world is like so you 
can make better decisions." 
The Notre Dame graduate 
said when he was coming out 
of school into the real world, 
it was "like walking into a 
black box." 
Approximately a dozen 
representatives from P&G 
were on hand to talk with in­
terested students at a recep­
tion following the presenta­
tion. 
Nicolosi said he was inter­
ested in visiting Notre Dame 
because "When I went from 
Notre Dame to Proctor and 
Gamble, there was no cul­
ture shock. The alignment of 
values ... is very good."

presenting P&G was a case

Police, ND/SMC Security work to combat drunk driving 
Editor's Note: These articles mark the second part of a three-part series examining the issues and incidents of drunk driving in the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's com­munities. 
By MARY HEILMANN and CHRIS BEDNARSKI Assistant News Editors 
It is a typical Friday night at the South Bend police depart­ment's traffic desk. A call comes in. 
There has been an accident, and an accident investigation car is requested. 
When the police officer ar­rives at the scene of the acci-1dent, he determines there is probable cause that the vehi­cle's driver may have been driving under the influence of alcohol. 
Mter filling out a Probable Cause Mfadavit, the policeman offers the driver a breathalizer test, a procedure the state of Indiana requires. If the driver refuses, his oper­ator's license may be suspended for one year. 
The driver agrees to the test, and he is driven to the county jail, where the test is adminis­tered. 
The test is positive; the driver has a blood-alcohol level higher than .10 percent. He is booked, fingerprinted, 

Prosecutor reviews DUI legal proceedings 
By MARY HEILMANN Assistant News Editor 
When a student is arrested for drunk driving, the initial media coverage of the incident adequately describes the ar­rest and booking process. But what happens after bail is posted, when the alleged of­fender's case is entrusted to the legal system? 
"Within a very few days after the person has been arrested, his case reaches my desk," said Deputy Prosecutor Brian Steinke of the Saint Joseph County Prosecutor's Office. 
"I review all the paperwork on DUis; my principal purpose is to screen those that warrant felony prosecution and sepa­rate these cases from mis­demeanors," he added. 
Steinke said that deternim­ing a felony from a mis­demeanor requires evaluation on three criteria: whether serious injury resulted from the DUI violation, whether the violation was a second offense, and whether it occurred while the driver's operator's license was already suspended for habitual traffic offenses. 
Describing the Dec. 6 inci­dent which resulted in the

mester, all of which involved accident victims. In one case, the victim required extensive hospitalization for broken up­per and lower jaws; in the other two, the victim died the next day from th1; injuries he suffered. 
"I think it's human nature that ifdrinking isn't allowed on campus, then naturally there will be people going off campus to local taverns to drink legal­ly, or illegally as the case may be," said Lieutenant Larry Blume of the South Bend Police Department's traffic depart­ment. 
"It's a shame that it has to be that way, but if they're off campus, the fact is that in out society they will be using a car. And that might mean they will be driving under the influence of alcohol," Blume added. 
It is a phenomena that Blume encounters daily in his position with South Bend's Alcohol Safety Awareness Program (ASAP), a federally-funded program under the auspices of the Governor's Task Force to Reduce Drunk Driving. 
Notre Dame Security Direc­tor Rex Rakow was appointed head of the Task Force this month, Blume said. 
The program, which has been in effect for four years, has provided the city of South Bend with $20,000 each year to combat the problem of drunk driving, Blume said.

Reverse culture shock experienced upon return to ND from abroad 
Mter six hours on a cramped but not too un­comfortable train you find yourself at the end of the line, a stranger in a strange train station. A long search of the timetables confirms your worst fears as you realize there are no more trains out of here until 5:10a.m. You camp out in the waiting room only to be thrown out on the street -they're closing the station for the night. You have no local money and no place to sleep. 
Thank God it's not snowing. 
None of the hotels seem to be closed. Since you don't see any signs for American Express or MasterCard, it doesn't really matter. The warmest place you can find is a bus platform, so it's off to sleep, only to be woken up by a multilingual drunk who asks (after two tries in French and Italian) "How's life?" 
You put your head in your hands and moan. 
Welcome to culture shock, the subject of today's column. It's not that bad at first, but it tends to grow on you like some kind of fungus. The first week's not too bad-everything is new and exciting and different. But after a few days of no McDonald's, no newspapers, no English, you tend to get sick of it all. 
People look a little ill when you try to tell them you got sick of traveling around Europe after a semester in London. You really do, though. Even if there is enough money and enough time, there just isn't enough patience. There are only so many different languages you can put up with, so many different train stations you can endure. But the worst is not over. 
Far worse than the culture shock of going, though, is the "reverse shock" of coming back. At least when you leave America for a foreign country, you expect something a little different. You're supposed to be happy coming home. 
And you are, kind of. 
But after thinking "Wow, these people on the plane are obnoxious," only to realize that they are fellow Americans, after wishing for the hundredth time for a pint of Guinness or some good bratwurst or a decent new play in town, after going to your eleventh dorm party in a week and realizing that you are sick to death of them, perhaps you're not so glad to get back. 
It's different from the change all us students undergo when we leave home for school. Home isn't home anymore, but Notre Dame and Saint Mary's become our homes. Mter reverse cul­ture shock, you don't really have a home. The

campus isn't quite the same anymore. Even the people have changed, you most of all. And you can't go back to London, or Angers, or Rome. 
If you happen to have lived in California you might have some idea of what returning foreign study students go through. It's a lot like an earthquake, coming back. Something you thought was rock solid and unchanging, some­thing that you lean on in a fundamental way, all of a sudden picks you up, bounces you around, and throws you down to the ground. Then it stops and goes back to what it was, almost. And of course your mind knows that things haven't changed all that much, and that you can still depend on the ground. But it's never quite the same. 
So the next time you see someone wearing mostly black and wishing for a pint of Guinness, you'll know how badly he wants it. And you'll also know why he turns down your offer of Old Milwaukee.

"We use some of the money to hire off-duty police officers to work the streets for DUI vi­olations.." 
Alcohol-awareness educa­tion constitutes another part of the program, Blume explained, saying two officers speak at the local high schools, an officer speaks at Notre Dame, and elementary-school children hear a police presentation which touches on the problems of driving under the influence of alcohol. 
"We're great believers in the designated driver program. If someone wants to get bombed one night, then there should be someone designated not to drink and to drive them home:' 
Blume said the South Bend Police Department and Notre Dame Security have cooperated in the past on ef­
forts  to  eliminate the  drunk

tained that "if anyone  (from  

Security) calls and asks for a 
speaker or some films, we'd be happy to help." 
He noted, however, that Notre Dame Security is the campus's own police depart­ment and thus responsible for educating the Notre Dame community. 
According to a Security offi­cer, Notre Dame Security will continue to address this respon­sibility this semester through the alcohol-awareness pro­gram it began before Christmas break. He said next week Security officers, along with an officer from the In­diana State Police, will visit the Notre Dame campus to outline and discuss Indiana's drunk­driving laws. 
In addition to a slide presentation about alcohol and driving, the officers will dem­onstrate the effects of alcohol consumption on student volun­teers, he said. 
During the demonstration, two volunteers will be allowed to raise their blood-alcohol con­tent to near .10 percent, the level at which one is legally in­toxicated in the state of In­diana.

According to Security, the of­ficers will then administer field sobriety tests to the students. This will show the effects of drinking on one's capacity to drive, he said. 
Following the demonstra­tion, the officers will remain with the students until their al­cohol level returns to normal, he said. 
Notre Dame junior Michael Cogswell was struck and killed by a drunk driver on the Saint Mary's campus last semester. Saint Mary's Security Director Richard Chlebek said his or­ganization will not implement any new educational policies at Saint Mary's. 
As in the past, if the accident is relatively minor --resulting in little damage and no injuries --then Saint Mary's Security will report the incident only to the College's administration, Chlebek said. 
If the accident is serious, however, or if Security suspects alcohol is involved, the accident will be reported to the Saint Joseph County Sheriff's Department, he added. 
Although both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's have spon­sored numerous alcohol-

"When a death became in­volved, we felt a misdemeanor charge was inappropriate and immediately put a halt to the processing of that charge. We awareness programs, Chlebek said he doesn't think drunk driving will ever be totally eliminated at the two schools. 
"There is only so much you can do when you're dealing with young adults to make them aware," Chlebek said. "I don't think we'll ever eliminate the drunk driving problem in this country." 
then began the paperwork for a felony charge," Steinke ex­plained. 
The felony charge in that case was a Class C felony, defined as a DUI causing death, Steinke said, adding that the presumptive penalty for such an offense is five years in prison, with a fine as high as $10,000. 
Incidents which involve in­jury but not death, designated as Class D felonies, have a two­year average penalty, to which the judge can add two years or subtract one year, Steinke said. Fines for Class D felonies can be as high as $10,000. 
If the prosecutor's office rules the case a misdemeanor, they designate it either a Class A DUI, which requires driver intoxication, or a Class C DUI, which requires a .10 blood al­cohol content, but does not con­note intoxication, Steinke said. 
Class A DUis are punishable by a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a $5,000 fine. Class C misdemeanors carry a penalty of 60 days in jail and a $500 fine. 
"All DUis we're talking about here, whether felonies or misdemeanors, have license suspensions," Steinke stressed. 
Once the prosecutor's office has decided on a classification, the case can go to either a Grand Jury -six citizens who hear testimony and determine whether there is basis for filing a charge -or the charge will be filed on the prosecutor's own volition. 
"We then send the formal paperwork over to the judge, who reviews the information for proper form and the Af­fadavit for Probable Cause. If the judge signs the informa­tion, he sets bond and signs an arrest warrant," Steinke said. Authorities then arrest the charged individual. 
The defendant has two hearings before the formal tri­al, Steinke said, one to read the charges and one to formally recognize his counsel. At this time, the judge sets a trial date "typically two months away," Steinke added. 
Steinke said felony charges involve a minimum two-day trial, because they require the selection of a 12-person jury. When felony charges are filed, a jury trial is automatically provided unless the defendant requests a bench trial, Steinke said. 
In cases classified as simple misdemeanors, he added, the normal route is a bench trial.

A variety of groups to be at CSC Festival 
By CARl MARTINEZ 
News Staff 
Approximately 30 to 35 dif­ferent group agencies will be represented at the Social Concerns Festival tonight in the multipurpose room at the Center for Social Con­cerns, .according to Justice and Peace Coordinator Dan Keusal. 
"I encourage people, both those who haven't been ex­posed to social concerns to come out and meet some of the groups to find out what the center is all about and to ask yourself if there is any way you can become in­volved," said Keusal. 
The Activities Night will be run like an open house, he said, both very informal, yet very informational. He said each group will have their own table displaying their program for recruit­ment. 
"We are not here to create a need, we're here to answer needs that are already there," said Keusal, who is chairing the event along with Kathy Royer, social and service action coordina­

tor, and student committee 
members. 
The festival, scheduled for 
6:30 to 9, is open to all stu­dents and community mem­bers, Keusal said. "The eligibility rule for participa­tion in these programs is in­terest." He added, "Many students are willing to use their personal time to be­come involved and this is good ... an important and healthy sign of what educa­tion does for you." 
The festival, he said, will feature both campus and South Bend groups, includ­ing the Neighborhood Study Help Program, the Council for the Mentally Retarded, Logan Center and others. 
The Center, according to Keusal, is making an extra special effort to concentrate on the various groups open to students. The main con­cern, he said, is to let people know they are welcome at anytime, not just tonight. 
Keusal said the center has had previous successful ac­tivities nights and a good turnout is expected for this year as well. 
Professor looks at Catholic, intellectual life 
By KAREN WEBB Copy Editor 
"Faith and reason are not ad­versaries," Dr. Terence Mar­tin said at a lecture Wednesday at Saint Mary's, addressing the question of the compatability between the Catholic and the intellectual community. 
The lecture, titled "The Cath­olic Experience and the Intel­lectual Life," was the first in a series offered by the Center for Spirituality. 
According to Martin, intel­lectuallife should reflect life in a community which seeks to be one, holy, catholic and apos­tolic. "Catholic intellectual life is characterized by committ­ments to integration or com­pleteness, to practical trans­formation or change, to serious and fruitful dialogue, and to lis­tening to the wisdom of the classics," he said. 
"Catholic thinking affirms at least some continuity between the world as it actually is and the world as it ought to be," he said. This sacramental view of the world is the difference be­tween the intellectual and the Catholic intellectual, Martin said. 
"The experience of living in a community which wants to be catholic (or universal) calls for a thinking which is care­fully trained in the art of dialogue... A holy community mandates an intellectual policy of conversation," Martin said. 
"What distinguishes the in­tellectual life from other forms of life is how we (intellectuals) practice the social art of con­versation," he said. 
"I have found the Catholic communities in which I live to be a place where certain very important ideals for living and working together are kept alive," he said. Nurturing com­monality and solidarity are marks of the Catholic intellec­tual world, Martin said. 
Martin also discussed the im­portance of classical works to the apostolic tradition of the Catholic church. 
"The intellectual life lived in keeping with such an ideal in­volves a kind of thinking which is firmly rooted in the clas­sics." Martin said. According to Martin, classic texts are still educators because they affect readers and their perceptions of the world. 
Dr. Martin is an assistant professor of theology at Saint Mary's.

Quote of the day 

"Ignorance of the law excuses no man; not that all men know the law, but because 'tis an excuse every man will plead, and no man can tell how to refute him." 
John Seldon 
(1584-1654) "Law" 

Over Christmas break, I found a home away from the dome. 
I was working part-time at the Finger Lakes Times, where I had interned over the summer, when I learned about this piece of Notre Dame heaven. It began innocently enough over lunch at the Pumpernickel restaurant in Geneva with two reporters from the Times, Carolyn Foster and Jean Jones. 
Eric Bergamo 
here's to future days 

"We should have lunch over at the Cedar Inn," Carolyn told me, "there's all this Notre Dame memorabilia there." 
Sounds interesting, I thought. And so I said that lunch at the Cedar Inn would be fine with me. I had heard of the Cedar Inn before from other people and I wanted to see this place for myself. 
Two days later, as the day's edition of the Times started to roll off the presses in the back of the building, I headed up to Beacon Hill in Geneva to meet the others at the Cedar Inn. I was the first one to arrive to the innocuous white clapboard building. For some reason, I had expected it to be classier than that. 
I parked the car in the parking lot and went inside. In the entrance there was a large painting of the Notre Dame leprechaun. I felt that I had come to the right place as I waited for Carolyn and Jean to get there from the office. 
The decor inside was strictly that of the small-town tavern; bar, barstools, tables. But behind the bar and on the walls was what could be classified as neo-classical Notre Dame. 
There was a sign with the words "Notre Dame Lane" in blue and gold. A sign for Notre Dame lacrosse. Drawings of Knute Rockne, George Gipp, The Four Horsemen, Frank Leahy, Ara Parseghian and Father Hesburgh hung from the wall along with numerous Notre Dame pennants. There were other Irish souvenirs on the shelves, even of those "Domer on Board" signs that hang from the inside of car windows. 
Near the top of the wall was a green board with all the years that Notre Dame had been national champions painted in white. Hopefully, there will be another year to paint in underneath the '77 on that board in the near future. 
We were joined at lunch by Don Had­ley, my managing editor who always asks me "Bergamo, do you have some­thing to do?", Tom Rickey, one of the copy editors and Doris Wolf, another reporter at the Times. From time to time I was called on to identify whose pictures were up on the wall. "Oh, that's Ara, he lead the Irish to the na-
P.O.BoxQ 
tional championship in 1966 and 1973" or "That's Father Hesburgh, he's the president of Notre Dame." 
It all reminded me that even though I was some 600 miles away from the university I love, I never really left Notre Dame. There are always things around that will remind of the Golden Dome. 
Even the shirts for the Cedar Inn had the Notre Dame fighting leprechaun on them. One more reminder of Notre Dame and its almost worldwide fame. 
I'll have to buy one of those the next time I'm home on break. Eric M. Bergamo is a junior govern­ment major and a regular Viewpoint columnist. 
Transfer urges student to find fulfilling place 
Dear Editor: 
I am writing this letter in response to a letter written by John Schloegel. In his letter, Schloegel expressed his ob­vious disillusionment with Notre Dame concluding that he may have made the wrong decision in deciding to attend this university. Although my opinion of this school is a great deal more positive than his, I think I know how he is feeling. I've been in his shoes before, but I did something about it -I trans­ferred to Notre Dame. 
When I graduated from high school, I had virtually no idea about where I wanted to go to college. I just per­functorily looked at a few schools that sounded good and settled into the one that sounded best. Soon, my hastiness caught up with me as I realized (much to my dismay) that I was not happy with my choice. After moping around for a semester or two I decided to do something to change my situation. I sat down, looked at my options, and decided to apply to some other schools. This time, though, I did some research and decided to apply to the schools I thought were best for me, instead of those that simply "sounded good." Well, here I am, and I couldn't be hap­pier. I can honestly look back and say 
Trudeau 

with conviction that I made the right decision. I changed my situation while I still could. 
Mr. Schloegel, I'm really sorry that you are unhappy here at Notre Dame, but, by the same token, if you feel that you've done your best to fit in here, you're a fool if you stay. Try to stick it out for the rest of the year, and then, if you still feel the same way, consider making a transfer. You'll be doing yourself a favor and you'll also be opening up a spot for someone who 
genuinely  wants  to  come  to  Notre  
Dame.

Students feeling loss must recall positives 
Dear Editor: 

This letter is directed toward the friends of Mike Cogswell. I didn't know him but I understand what all of you are going through. My former room­mate died my sophomore year. I hurt a lot, because I cared for him quite a lot. Why him and not me? He was such a great person. He always wore a smile and never had a bad word to say about anyone. From what I've heard this week, this sounds a lot like a description of Mike. You must look at those qualities and try to express them more in your own lives. You all had the op­portunity to know Mike and see these qualities. I know you feel sad, because this brings back very sad memories for me, but see if you can see the good in all this. Look back and remember Mike smiling and making you smile and feel glad that you got a chance to know him.

President's actions go against people's will 
Dear Editor: 

It is difficult to know whether Joe Murphy's editorial on January 15 about our president's actions is merely cyni­cal, or rather myopic and completely without principle. The "key question" 
Over 500 letters to the editor and 300 col­umns appeared last year in Viewpoint. Join the growing number of people who feel their thoughts and opinions do make a dif­ference.Write to P.O.Box Q, Viewpoint Department, Notre Dame, IN, 46556 
Doonesbury 
as he puts it, regarding current affairs in Washington is "whether the situation warranted the use of such powers as the president decided to use." Yet it is clear from his presentation that "war­ranted" simply means possible of suc­cess. What has become clear is a flagrant pattern of violation of the will of the American people as embodied in law. One need not pause to argue very long in asking whether such a pattern of activity, of which we have simply seen the outcroppings, can be warran­ted. At least a student of American in­stitutions would not linger long on such a question. So the citation of Supreme Court cases is mere window dressing for a totally unprincipled pattern of ac­tivity.

Students face reality 
With room picks just around the cor­ner, Saint Mary's students are begin­ning to consider the possibility of life off-campus. I am aware of this fact be­cause many of these students have knocked on my door, toured my house, and asked me questions. Although there is an aura that encompasses Campus View Apartments, Notre Dame Apart­ments and the many student houses in the area, off-campus life is not for everyone.  
Eileen Scherer guest column  
For many students off-campus life is a learning experience quite apart from dorm living. Students acquire impor­tant life skills such as budgeting, home care and paying bills. Students also have to deal with life's little emer­gencies. In October, the shower at my house would not shut off and in Novem­ber, the pilot went out in our gas heater; both times our landlord was unavail­able. Other not  

ready to take on the additional respon­sibility. Pat Rissmeyer, director of residence life, believes some students need the close contact in the dorms; they enjoy having their bathrooms cleaned and their food prepared. 
Presently 101 students from Saint Mary's live off campus. Students con­sidering life in an apartment or a house should be aware of the positive and negative aspects before they move. 
'For your own protection, don't be too trusting. Don't live alone. Get acquainted with your neighbors and keep an eye out for each other.' 
Problems among roommates in­crease when they take on larger living spaces. The different cleanliness stand­ards of roommates combined with the serious issues of paying bills, hosting parties, shopping, cooking and cleaning present difficulties which are un­familiar to the students. One problem in our house is lists. Cleaning lists, pay­ment lists, food lists and lists to stop writing lists clutter our chalk board in the kitchen. However useful the lists turn out to be, dealing with them is usually a nuisance. 
According to Rissmeyer, many steps have been taken to improve off-campus conditions. Representation of the stu­dents has been increased to include two advisors and a representative to the Board of Governance. The off-campus advisors work with Student Activites to provide the camaraderie that exists in the residence halls. Christmas trees and cakes are given to the dorms by Student Activities, and are also ordered for the off-campus lounge. 
The off-campus lounge has been up­
dated to include a color television, a 
of living off-campus 
microwave and a coffee machine. New 
mailboxes with individual combina­
tions also have been added to the lounge 
area. The off-campus lounge serves as 
a meeting place. I often meet one of 
my housemates there for lunch, to 
watch a soap or catch a ride home. 
Students can prepare themselves for the transition by considering the mon­etary aspect for an apartment or house. Rissmeyer suggests that students need to educate themselves about living ex­penses on a budget. They need to in­clude rent, heat, water, telephone charges, cooking and electricity to ar­rive at a realistic cost. 
Marta Ritten, a senior who has lived off campus for two years, sees off­campus life as a chance to live and learn in the real world. Ritten believes that some advantages include the op­portunity to take on additional respon­sibilities, to enjoy privacy and to meet more people. 
Mr. Richard Chlebek, director of safety and security at Saint Mary's, considers good judgment and common sense necessities for off-campus living. students, however, are Chlebek encourages students to read up on protection. He wants students to be safety-conscious. "For your own protection, don't be too trusting. Don't live alone. Get acquainted with your neighbors and keep an eye out for each other." 
In the first few weeks of school, we made friends with one of our neighbors and isolated another. One older couple didn't mind our occassional parties; the other did. To insure good neighborly relations, we informed our neighbors of our upcoming party and supplied them with our names and phone num­ber, so they could contact us if the party was too loud. 
As Saint Mary's students search for their new home off-campus, they should remember a few things. Choose an en­vironment that is safe. Apartments usually have their own security staff and parking lots that are well-lit. Houses in residential neighborhoods should be chosen carefully. Certain con­siderations should be made. Is there adequate street lighting? Who are your neighbors? Is the location safe? Are the housing conditions more than ade­quate? 
The most important thing students 
can do before they look at houses and 
apartments is to call the present resi­
dents first before they drop in. Too 
many times students have plowed 
through our house like invited guests, 
disrupting the daily activity of our 
home with their anticipation to live off 
campus. I remember all too well my 
own anticipation, and empathize with 
these almost-off-campus students. 
Each of my living arrangements, on 
campus and off, has been a good expe­
rience for me at a particular time in 
my life. Typical of most seniors, I'm 
looking forward to graduation and yet 
another new living situation.

The Iran affair is such an outrageous scandal because wrapped up in one in­cident are a plethora.of legal violations. Not only do the Democrats charge the Reagan administration with secretly ignoring its own anti-terrorism policy and not being able to control its foreign policy makers, but also for the possible breach of laws covering covert activi­ties, the selling of weapons, and Contra aid. Most agree that the details behind the Iran affair should be certain char­acteristics of the present investigations into the incident threaten to prevent a timely and just resolution of this foreign policy misadventure. 
Steve Claeys 

guest column 
The first disturbing aspect of the Iran inquiry is the number of investigating bodies involved. A legion of congres­sional committees have taken it upon themselves to conduct hearings about the scandal. This includes the Senate Foreign Relations committee, the House Foreign Affairs committee, the House and Senate oversight commit­tees on intelligence, and finally, House and Senate special select committees devoted to the investigation. The exec­utive branch, on the other hand, has also committed the Justice Depart­ment, the FBI, a special prosecutor, and an NSC review group. This myriad of bodies was created to insure a thor­ough investigation of the affair; instead they will lead to confusion and delay. 
Instead of a systematic and coor­dinated look at what took place at the White House, the various groups will produce a number of different conclu­sions. They will be based upon dis­similar interpretations of the same evidence and information not available to all of the bodies. Alternatively, a single joint congressional committee should be created to investigate the en­tire Iran affair. This committee would have access to the same information available to the regular intelligence and foreign affairs committees, and at the end of the investigation would sub­mit a report of any violations to the 
special prosecutor. Similarly, the exec­utive branch should limit itself to the special prosecutor and his staff who may use the facilities of the Justice De­partment if needed. 
The Democrats' extreme politiciza­tion of the situation is a second detri­mental aspect of the Iran investigation. While no one can blame the Democrats for taking advantage of the opportunity to attack the Republicans and their "teflon president," if they continue their irresponsible handling of the af­fair, the Democrats threaten to harm the inquiry. Instead of being concerned with uncovering the truth of this sordid affair, the Democrats seem determined to use the situation for bashin~ the Reagan administration. This behavior will only result in dragging out the in­vestigation through unproductive hearings, and damaging the public's trust in the government's ability to keep itself in check. The Democrats may also hurt their chances in 1988 as they expend their energies on the in­vestigation in lieu of proposing new policies. A serious Democratic presidential candidate cannot hope to win only on the damage the Iran affair has done to the Republicans, but must prove that the Democratic party can produce an· alternative to the Republi­can. 
I am not calling for a speedy end to the Iran affair investigation in order to prevent damage to the "symbolism of the president," or to prevent the scan­dal from becoming an election issue. Nor should we in any way sacrifice jus­tice for haste. Instead, I feel that the American people and government must quickly resolve this outrage. Time wasted by the inquiry is time which could be spent on a number of domestic and foreign policy issues such as arms control, the budget deficit, farm sup­port, and international trade. A single investigating body in both the legisla­tive and executive branches, along with some political restraint by the Democrats, will help prevent the inves­tigation itself from becoming a scandal.

Freshmen Joel Clark and Colin Gumbs, who notched their first wins last week, will also see match time as the foilists try to better their 9-0 record against the weaker competition. "We don't have a whole lot of strength in the foil," Gillham explained. 
DeCicco will also look to a developing sabre squad which boasts senior Kevin Stouter­mire (3-0) and junior Geoff Rossi (2-0). Presently, the Irish are searching for a solid number-three sabre man among freshman Danny Yu (1­0), sophomore Tim Collins (1-1) and senior Brian Quinn (0-1). 
While they look for that number-three fencer in the sabre, the Irish are hoping that Rossi will regain the confi­dence that could make him a top fencer. After notching an 18-2 record as a freshman, Rossi suffered a compound leg fracture that sidelined him last year. 
"Who's going to support Kevin Stoutermire in the sabre -that's a big question mark quite frankly," DeCicco said. "I know that Geoff Rossi is a bona fide number two right now, give Kevin Stoutermire a run for his money as far as being number one on the (sabre) team." 

The weakest link on the Irish squad this season appears to be an inexperienced epee squad, which DeCicco hopes will turn around to enable a second straight run for the national championship for the Irish. Last week, the epeeist, led by senior Tim Vaughan (2-0), posted a 6-3 mark. 
"I'm hoping to see one or more of them to start fencing like they want to be number one," DeCicco said. "When you've got a group of epeeists and none of them is coming forth, I want to shake them up. I'm digging into my bag of tricks. I have to stimulate them." 
While the Irish look among sophomores Todd Griffee (2-1) and Ted Fay 0-1) and seniors Dave Lennert 0-0) and John Haugh (0-1), the Badgers will put forth a solid epee unit that could plague the Irish. 
The Irish women foilists will also be looking to advance an unblemished record, as they look to improve upon last year's second-place finish in the NCAA tourney. 
Standing in the way for Notre Standford and Minnesota. 
According to women's Head Coach Yves Auriol, the Irish are a better team this year. 
"It's a solid team," Auriol said. "If the girls do a good job, we should have a good season." 
Junior Molly Sullivan (4-0) leads the Irish as the defending NCAA champ in the women's foil. Sophomore Janice Hynes (2-0) adds a solid number-two weapon after finishing 12th in the NCAA tourney. 
Adding depth are seniors Cindy Weeks 0-1) and Vittoria Quaroni 0-1) and sophomore Brenda Leiser ( 1-1). Surprising Auriol are freshman Anna Bar­reda (2-0) and Kristin Kralicek (2-0). 
After being ineligible for meets last year, Kralicek joins the incoming Barreda to bol­ster the Irish attack. "We didn't have Kristin Kralicek last year, and she's going to be able to help us -that's a big plus," Auriol said. Anna Boretta is a big plus too." 
The Irish travel tomorrow for Madison and their Saturday Wisconsin invite. While they should be favored to come away with perfect records, they will also be fine-tuning their act for upcoming rival Wayne State and a jam-packed February schedule.

Dillon topples Alumni as IH basketball resumes schedule 
-·,... 

By KEVIN McCORMACK Sports Writer 
While some Notre Dame stu­dents might be concerned only about the hoops going on when the Irish play in the south dome of the ACC, they might be surprised to find several heated battles at various gyms all across the venue in the form of Interhall basketball. 
And while the season is still young, the excellent games have been played already. 
In the ACC division, Dillon A, fresh off its 88-30 pummeling of Flanner A-2, squeaked by a hard-luck Alumni squad, 59-56. Alumni had lost its opening game to Off-Campus A, 54-53. The Big Red looked sluggish in th beginning, however, as the Dogs took advantage of solid outside shooting by Shawn O'Brien and John ZadeH, taking a 19-18 lead at halftime. The tough inside game of Dillon, on both ends of the court, enabled the Big Red to capture a nine­point cushion at the end of the third quarter. 
Some key defensive plays,

however-by Jim Welsh in par­ticular -brought Alumni back within three, but missed free throws and key turnovers left the Dogs short, something cap­tain Matt Hanley knows the Dogs will have to improve upon if they have any chance of get­ting back in the race. 
"When the games are close, you can't make those kind of mistakes," said Hanley. "We also have to be more aggres­sive in the future. We don't have a lot of big guys or football players, but we can't be in­timidated." 
As for Dillon, the key to win­ning the last two games has been its ability to outmuscle its opponents. 
"Bill Healy, John Livingston and myself will have to hold our own in the middle," said Dillon captain Frank Izzo. "We took advantage of our height and bulk in both of our first two games." 
Pat Marget led the Big Red with 12 points against Alumni. In the Big Ten division, Sorin A and Holy Cross A have raced

high school. In fact, basketball kept him away from track his freshman year because he was too tired at the end of the season to go out for track. 
He finally picked up the shot that year during a field day at his high school. His first toss traveled farther than the best toss of a senior who was prac­ticing for the city champion­ships. 
Upon the advice of his high school track coach, who saw talent going to waste, Kraus 
joined the team. His senior year he placed second in the state championships. At this point many colleges saw potential. Sixteen colleges to be exact. But he turned down all those scholarships to come to Notre Dame. Immediately he was intro­duced to weights. His top bench mark went from 240 pounds in June to 350 pounds currently. He was also introduced to dining hall food, and his weight began to drop dramatically. As a result he was placed on the "Four-Plate Diet," meaning he had to eat four main entres at each meal. A lack of upperclassmen at the shot put left Kraus, along with freshmen Ted MeNamara and Rob Fitzgerald, to fend for themselves. But Kraus says he does not feel uncomfortable in that position. · "That's the way it's always been for me," he says. "I've never had anyone older who could show me how to do it. It would be nice to have someone older to show us how. "It's what you put into it. (Assistant Coach Ted) Potts can't spend time with everyone at the same time. We know what we're supposed to do, and we try to help each other." A goal-oriented . person, Kraus has set his first goal as to qualify for the IC4A's. His toss at the Hoosier Dome was just 8 inches shy of the 52 feet, 2 inches needed to qualify. A football star and a former basketball player join four other runners in seeing their first action of the season tomor­row night. Irish flanker Tim Brown will face some stiff competition in the form of Michigan State's Derrick Leonard in the 60-yard dash. And former Irish guard Jeff Peters will compete in the high jump. Sprinter Tony Ragunas and distance runners David Warth, Mike O'Conner and Ron Markezich will run against the Spartans after sitting out the Hoosier Dome Invitational. The meet gets under way

Thompson has work cut out with 1988 Olympic basketball 
Seoul, South Korea, 1988, is just around the corner, and for the first time we have an Olym­pic basketball coach that's over six-feet, four-inches tall: John Thompson, the towel­wringing, resident capital-G genius of Georgetown Univer­sity. 
For the few who are un­familiar, he's known as "Big Bad John" to his opponents in won in 1976. And, he also helped in selecting the material for Bobby Knight of Indiana in 1984.

John Elway and the Denver Broncos hope to avoid the tenacious New York Giants' pass rush by establishing a running game in Sunday's 
Giants have edge in ground attack; Broncos also want to establish run 
APPhoto Super Bowl. The Giants, however, appear bet­ter suited to keeping the ball on the ground. See related story below. 
Associated Press PASADENA, 
Calif. -The 
New York Giants are confident they can run the ball on the Den­ver 

Broncos. The Broncos hope they can run on the Giants. 
In other words, if Sunday's Super Bowl turns into a ground war, the Giants have a big edge. 
The Broncos, nine-point un­derdogs in the NFL champion­ship game, have spent the week talking about having to es­tablish the run to keep the pres­sure of the Giants' menacing front seven off John Elway. As Coach Dan Reeves puts it: 
"If John is forced to throw 50 or 60 times, we're going to be in trouble." 
The Broncos were the ninth worst team in the NFL at run­ning the ball; the Giants were the best at stopping the run. Joe Morris' 1,516 yards, second best in the NFL, was 362 yards better than the combined total of the Broncos' two best backs -sammy Winder and and Gerald Willhite. 
Moreover, the Giants were not enthralled with their rush­ing performance in the first meeting between the teams, a 19-16 New York win Nov. 23, al­though Morris gained 106 yards in 23 carries. 
And even at their most con­fident, the Broncos don't seem as confident about running as the Giants are. 

"Joe Morris is a friend of 
mine and a great running 
back," Willhite says. "I think 
I'm just as good as Joe, and 
Sammy thinks he's just as good 
... But Joe thinks he's better 
than anyone." 
The Giants' offensive scheme is simple and no se­cret : run Morris until the Broncos show they can stop him and use the running to set up Phil Simms' passing. 
The Broncos, meanwhile, use quickness and deception more than brute force to stop the run -Los Angeles Raiders Coach Tom Flores says they might use 25 different defensive fronts in a 60-play game. They may shift two or three times before the ball is snapped. 
"We're trying to simplify things from what we did the last time," says New York cen­ter Bart Oates, who has a 20­point weight advantage over Greg Kragen, the Broncos' 245­pound nose tackle. 
"I think we reacted too much then to what they were doing. We may have spent too much time adjusting the last time in­stead of concentrating on blocking our man." 
"The movement can cause some blocking problems," says Ron Ehrhardt, the Giants' of­fensive coordinator. "But you've just got to make sure you've got the right people blocking the right people on their side." 
Some of New York's power comes from fullback Maurice Carthon and tight end Mark Bavaro, each one of the best blockers at his position in the league. The Giants may also add a second tight end, Zeke Mowatt, as they did with con­siderable success during the season. 
The 5-7 Morris, meanwhile, has the ability to hide behind the front, then use his quick­ness to cut inside the defense. To counteract that, the Denver linebackers have been working out with a huge medicine ball to teach the linebackers to keep their hands and bodies low when they try to tackle Morris. 
Denver's problems in run­ning are compounded by injur­ies on the offensive line, where Paul Howard, the most experi­ence blocker, is out with a knee injury and will be replaced by second-year man Mark Cooper. Keith Bishop, their Pro Bowl guard, has also been hurt but will play. 
The Broncos must deal with New York's linebackers -not only league MVP lawrence Taylor, but eight-time Pro Bowler Harry Carson and the Carl Banks, who plays the op­posite outside spot from Taylor. Most teams put a second blocker on Taylor and sometimes even a third. 
Like the Giants, the Broncos get a lot of blocking from their tight end -Clarence Kay, who is on a par with Bavaro as a blocker if not a pass receiver. But while Kay did a good job on Banks in the first game, the Broncos ran for just 80 yards, 51 of them on eight scrambles by Elway. 
Kay, with Joey Hackett or Or­son Mobley on the other side, may be the key to handling Taylor because a double-team opens up lanes for other Giants defenders.

Irish fencing squads looking to reach top 
By MIKE CHMIEL 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's fen­cing team will attempt to im­prove upon a 1-0 record and ex­tend its 54-meet winning streak, while the Notre Dame women's fencing team will also look to boost its 1-0 mark this weekend in a five-team meet at Wisconsin. 
"I hope we can continue the winning ways," Irish head coach Mike DeCicco said. "If we can improve like I hope we can, then I think that we're going to be good enough to con­tinue with what we've been doing. But we have to improve in the epee, and we have to im­prove in the sabre. If we im­prove a lot more in the foil, they'll have a law against it." 
Traveling to Madison, Wis., the Irish will be facing Big Ten rivals Wisconsin and Min­nesota, Chicago, and Lawrence. Last year in Chicago, the Irish went 20-7 against the Wisconsin Badgers while also notching a 23-4 win against the Chicago Maroons. 
This season, Wisconsin joins Illinois and Ohio as the top teams in the Big Ten and in the Midwest. The Irish will also travel to Ohio State on Feb. 7, while Illinois will visit Notre Dame on Feb. 21. 
"Wisconsin is going to be very, very tough," DeCicco said. "The others (at this weekend's meet) will have in­dividuals -an epeeist here, a foilist there -but when you talk in terms of total team, you've 
Unusual athlete Kraus adds strength in field 
By PETE GEGEN Assistant Sports Editor 
A coach once said that poten­tial is just a fancy way of saying, "You ain't done noth­ing yet." But once you get a look at freshman shot putter Tom Kraus, you probably will think that coach was a bit too sarcastic. 
Kraus stands at 6-5, 260 pounds, and is currently the top shot putter for the Irish indoor track team. This is amazing considering he has thrown the shot for only three years, and he had never used weights until this past summer. 
Now that's potential. 
"He has both strength and size," says Head Coach Joe Piane. "The kid has tons of po­tential." 
Already the Toledo, Ohio, na-

Potential is one word for Kraus. Unusual is another, that is if you adhere to traditional stereotypes of big men. 
Consider, the man has never played football. Ever. 
"I've had everyone and his brother try to get me to play football," says Kraus. 
Kraus stayed away from football on a doctor's advice be­cause he grew one foot between the seventh and eighth grades, and his knees were weak.

got to think about Chicago." 
Last weekend, the Badgers knocked off Northwestern, Ohio State, Stanford and Chicago, and dropped a close match to Illinois. The 4-1 Badgers are led by Alex Renk, who finished 21st in the foil in the NCAA Championship Tournament last March; Drew Bailey, who went undefeated against a tough Illinois epee squad last week; and Ken Fiorell, who, according to Badger coach Tony Gillham, "had a good week last week." 
The defending national champion Irish squad will base its attack with a solid foil squad and a developing sabre squad. 
The Irish will enter the meet with two all-America foilists in senior Charles Higgs­Coulthard and sophomore Yehuda Kovacs. Each went un­defeated in Notre Dame's opener against Stanford last week and posts a perfect 2-0 mark. The Irish are also enjoy­ing the 3-0 mark recorded by sophomore Derek Holeman. 
"Charles, who has already won the national title, is fen­cing well," DeCicco said. "Yehuda Kovacs has picked up where he left off last year, when he fenced for the gold medal in the nationals. 
·"The one pleasant surprise, in my opinion, is the quality of fencing we're getting out of Derek Holeman, a first-year guy. He didn't fence last year, but this year, he's fencing well. He's my best foilist right now
