WORLD BRIEFS 
Nicaraguans began registering Sunday to vote in February's national elections as American congressmen and other observers watched for evidence of fraud. Nearly 5,000 booths na­tionwide were opened to register the estimated 1.9 million voters. President Daniel Ortega was the first in line at the booth serving his area. 
About 1 ,000 people in Manila, Philippines loyal to Ferdinand Marcos marched through the capital on Sunday and demanded that President Corazon Aquino allow the late leader's body to be buried in his homeland. Mrs. Aquino said Sunday she will follow any Supreme Court order to allow the return of Marcos' body. but was confident the justices would support her ban. 
An earthquake in southwestern Iran early Sunday caused heavy destruction and landslides that damaged at least 300 houses, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported. There were no immediate reports of casualties from relief teaf!!S that were rushed to the region, the agency added. The news agency. monitored in Nicosia, said the quake measured 5.1 on the Hichter scale. 
NATIONAL BRIEFS 
An unapproved drug popular in underground efforts to fight the AIDS virus since it showed promise in the laboratory is apparently ineffective in the body, according to a medical journal report. In the Oct. 1 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine, re­searchers report on the use of dextran sulfate in 18 healthy volun­teers. saying that after administering the drug orally and intra­venously, they found only traces of any activity by the drug.

Christina LoCasto of New York City was to begin a six­month jail term Oct. 14, but a San Mateo County Superior Court judge decided Friday that her sentence should begin after the birth of her fourth child, due in mid-October. 
The Dan Ryan Expressway was reopened Sunday. provid­ing some relief for Chicago area motorists who have suffered from a two-year traffic headache as a result of the $250 million rehabilitation, the largest such project in state history. The pro­ject was completed a month ahead of schedule, state officials an­nounced during a reopening ceremony on the highway. 
An extremely potent form of heroin that appeared in San Francisco recently has caused dozens of overdoses and one death and is overwhelming hospitals, officials said Saturday. At least 42 people have overdosed on the Mexican black tar heroin since Friday morning. and doctors are barely able to handle all the pa­tients crowding the hallways, said Dr. Ronald Dieckman, emer­gency room physician at San Francisco General Hospital, where 38 of the victims were treated. 
Oral sex can transmit the AIDS virus. according to the San Franciso Health Department, which has documented the first two cases. "If people have bargained that oral sex is what they're going to do and stay uninfected, we now have direct evidence that it can happen," Dr. George Rutherford. director of the depart­ment's AIDS office, said Friday.

Cutting funds to 'offensive' art isn't censorship 
The definition of "art" has never been clear­
cut, and it got even more vague last week on 
Capitol Hill. 
House and Senate negotiators reached a com­promise agreement Friday that would ban fed­eral funding for art deemed obscenf;) and lacking in significant literary or artistic merit. 
That's a tall order. Letting legislators decide how the government's money is spent is one thing. but having them judge artistic merit is another. 
This congressional discussion started when some conservatives objected to two exhibitions sponsored by the National Endowment for the Arts. I suppose that's why the NEA will deter­mine whether a work is obscene. 
The federally sponsored showings included photos depicting children in erotic poses in ho­mosexual and sadomasochistic themes and a photo of a crucifix in a jar of urine. 
The agreement Friday would deny federal funds to art that depicts sexual acts. sado­masochism, homosexuality or the sexual ex­ploitation of children. One needn't be schooled in art to recognize those things as offensive. 

But what is art, anyway? Webster's Second New Riverside Dictionary calls it "the activity of using imagination and skill to create beautiful things." OK, so what is beauty? "A quality or a combination of qualities that delights the senses or appeals to the mind." 
By this definition, art isn't limited to museum exhibits. Are magazine photographs art? Are buildings and parks art? Is a steak dinner art? Tell me and we'll both know. 
Why shouldn't sadomasochism, homosexuality and sexual exploitation be considered offensive? For most Americans, those things delight neither the senses nor appeal to the mind. 
Most folks would agree that obscene art more or less lacks significant merit. But who can de­termine what "significant artistic merit" is? 
Here's where it gets complicated. 

. The definition of art is vague because it varies from person to person. What is beautiful for one person may be ugly for another. Something that Jack thinks is extraordinary may be ordinary to Jill. 
The point is, one cannot compare Picasso to Michelangelo. People who like Matisse may dis­like Degas. Art is the most subjective thing in the world. It's impossible to make objective decisions about it.

'The government 
isn't censoring art. It 
is merely choosing 
what art it wants to 
support.' 
Ali Regis Coccia Managing Editor 

Congress has taken on a bigger task than it can handle with this latest decision. Fortunately, however, the House and Senate arc talking about only the art that Uncle Sam chooses to support. 
The decision would ban federal funding for art that is considered obscene or without merit; it doesn't ban the work itself. The House and Senate agreement will not hurt art; it will only prevent taxpayer dollars from supporting what a majority of Americans view as indecent. 
No doubt there will be an outcry over the deci­sion, calling it censorship of art. And that's too bad. because the government isn't censoring art. It is merely choosing what art it wants to sup­port. 
Isn't the decision usually left to whomever holds the purse? ~fter all, you should get what you pay for. 
Art. and obscenity. I'll venture, means different things to different people. I find paintings and photographs of nudes more distasteful than ob­scene, for example. But others may interpret them as admirable works of art or just plain ob­scene. 
Some things, however. are the same no matter whose eyes view them. Works that depict sado­masochism. homosexuality or sexual exploita­tion are offensive. 
Whether such works have any significant artistic merit is for artists and art critics to de­cide. 
Whether such works should be shown at the taxpayers' expense is for the government to de­cide. 
The public shouldn't worry that the govern­ment is getting too big for its legislative britches. If Congress starts to act as censor, the people will let it know. 
As for federally sponsored art exhibitions, you should get what you pay for.

Kernan aids victims of Hurricane Hugo 
By SANDY WIEGAND 
News Copy Editor 
Aid to South Carolina victims of Hurricane Hugo was pro­vided through Mayor Joe Kernan. who sent 15 park de­partment workers there last week. 
The mayor's two assistants are among those sent. a secre­tary said. 
Two trucks from a local leas­ing company were sent, and lo­cal banks donated money to the cause. Money and non-perish­able foods were collected at Coveleski Regional Stadium. 
Rich Daly, lJ.Ssistant director of alumni clubs, said that the Council of Mayors is still asking for donations for the victims, including building supplies, canned goods, and clothing, all of which can be dropped off at Coveleski Stadium. 
Associated Press 
CHAHLOTTE, N.C. -Jim Bakker returns to the stand for more cross-examination at his fraud trial today, after a ses­sion last week that even his de­fense lawyer says was "very devastating" to his case. . 
Bakker, charged with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy related to his handling of fi­nances at the television min­istry, testified Friday that he never defrauded anyone or con­spired with others at PTL to commit fraud. lie is expected to wind up his testimony Monday. 
The case probably will go to the jury late this week. 
George Davis, Bakker's lead defense attorney, didn't appear confident that Bakker's testi­mony Friday had convinced the jury his client is innocent. 
"That was a pretty heavy cross-examination," the 82­year-old Davis told the Greensboro News & Record when asked how he thought the questioning had gone. "It was very damaging, very devastat­ing." 
He smiled weakly and added, "It didn't have anything to do 
.

Daly recetvod a call last week from a member of the Notre Dame alumni club in Charleston, South Carolina. Daly offered the assistance of the Notre Dame community, and later tho president of the club called him back, accepting the offer. Daly contacted Jim Roemer, director of community rela­tions,· who called the mayor and urged him to design a plan for aid to the victims. A Red Cross employee, O.K. Bell, is looking for Notre Dame students from the Charleston area to help raise money for the victims. "I would hope that Notre Dame students could mobilize under the leadership of South Carolina and Puerto Rican stu­dents for food and money col­lection," said Jim Roemer about the Red Cross plan.

Several episodes during Friday's testimony indicated Bakker's team may have been caught off-guard.

Boy giant arrives at 
U.S. for treatment 
"She  is  a  mother,"  said

Associated Press 
ROCHESTER, Minn. -At 7, Igor Ladan is already about 6 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds. He's come thousands of miles from his native Soviet Union in hopes doctors can re­move a dangerous tumor from his skull and stop his abnormal growth. 
Mayo Clinic surgeons plan to remove a rare pituitary gland tumor from the boy doctors call a "pituitary giant." 
Igor and his mother, Svitlana Ladan, arrived here three weeks ago after she waged a worldwide letter-writing cam­paign from her native city of Kiev to find treatment for her son. The costs of the boy's care are being donated. 
"I was so happy, I nearly died," Ladan said last week through a translator.

West Germany that was an­nounced Saturday night, the East Germans had to travel in state-run trains back through their former Communist home­land as a face-saving measure for the government. 
Czechoslovakia, also with a hard-line government, had vowed that it would not allow the refugees to leave for the West from Czechoslovakia. 
Still, the action represented an embarrassing retreat for the aging leadership in East Berlin, which had severely crit­icized Hungary's action. 
The once-unthinkable exodus of East Germans reflects dra­matic changes in the Soviet bloc and a growing disunity among its member states. 

Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, the galvanizing force for reforms sweeping much of Eastern Europe, will visit East Berlin Friday and Saturday for celebrations of East Germany's 40th anniver­sary. 
llis talks with East German leader Erich Honecker are ex­pected to deal with the exodus, which has threatened the na­tion's already demoralized work force. 
"I hope that Gorbachev, dur­ing his talks with the leaders of (East Germany) will try to con­vince them that political re­forms arn also in the interest of the German Democratic Hepublic," said Genscher. 
A high-ranking Soviet official was quoted by the West German Die Welt newspaper as saying Moscow welcomed East Germany's decision to allow the weekend exodus. 
Valentin Falin, head of the Soviet Central Committee's in­ternational relations section, also said he believed Gorbachev will travel to East Berlin with important messages for both German governments, Die Welt said. There was no elaboration. 
East Berlin emphasized it ex­pected the latest exodus to be a one-time event, after which West Germany would return to "normal international cus­toms" at its embassies. 
In Prague, police initially sur­rounded the West German em­bassy to block newly arrived East Germans from scaling a spiked fence into the muddy grounds. But the embassy later 
again  began  letting  East  
Germans  back  into  the  em­ 
bassy.

When doctors in Kiev and Moscow had no treatment, Igor's mother wrote to the Hed Cross in Switzerland. which ad­vised her to write to doctors and hospitals in eountries sueh as England and the United States.

But letter followed letter, in­quiry after inquiry. 
The glasnost-era easing of travel and other restrictions on Soviet citizens also helped, she said. "Otherwise he'd never be here." 
The family eventually was m­ferred to the Mayo Clinic and Dr. Donald Zimmerman, a pe­diatric cndoerinologist they now call "the miraele doctor." 
Because the family lacks money and insurance, Zimmerman asked the clinic to absorb the costs of Igor's eare, and a pharmaeeutical house agreed to donate medicine. 
"People have been so good since the moment she stepped from the airplane," Sahulenko said. "That is something won­derful in Ameriea." 
After the operation, radiation and follow-up drug therapy should complete the removal of the tumor and stop the exeess production of growth hormone, a Mayo Clinic spokeswoman said Sunday. 
Zimmerman said last week that the boy's overall health is good, although there is concern the tumor eould press on the optic nerves and interfere with his vision.

Rep. Bill Archer, a Texas Republican, is surrounded by reporters as he talks on the telephone to President Bush from Capitol Hill Thursday concerning the passage of the capital gains tax reduction plan. Bush, unaware that reporters were listening in, criticized House Majority Leader Richard Gephart for what he termed "personal" arguments against a capital gains tax cut. Story below. 
Senate leader believes he can kill President's capital gains tax cut 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said Sunday he has the votes to defeat the House­passed version of President Bush's capital gains tax cut, a measure he likened to crack co­caine. 
However, Mitchell acknowl­edged that a revised version might have enough support to win narrow approval because Bush's "irresponsible position ... makes it extremely difficult to prevent any tax cut from oc­curring." 
Interviewed on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press," the Maine Democrat said he is positive the 27 -month capital gains tax cut approved by the House last week will not be enacted by the Senate. 
"It is so bad, so wrong for the economy," he said. "It will do for the deficit what crack does for the user: a quick short high followed by a long, painful depression." 
The measure would reduce from 33 percent to 19.6 percent the maximum tax rate on prof­its from the sale of stocks and other investments until 1992. The rate then would climb back to 28 percent with assets in­dexed so that any gains at­tributed to inflation after that point would not be taxed. 
Its attractiveness to lawmak­ers stems from predictions by economists that a selloff by in­vestors rushing to cash in on the low-rate window would generate $9.4 billion in addi­tional tax revenue over the next three years.

After then, however, the rev­enues would fall dramatically and actually worsen the deficit by a total of $21 billion over the following five years, ac­cording to Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation. 
''I'm confident that this so-called yo-yo -on two years, off two years -and the way in which it's constructed cannot pass," Mitchell said. "There's a growing realization that it will be bad for the economy ... and will do nothing for the future of this country." 
While saying he personally opposes any cut in capital gains taxes now, Mitchell acknowl­edged that many members of his party favor enacting a dif­ferential that would tax capital gains at a lower rate than wages, interest or dividend in­come. 
"Whether or not they will co­alesce behind any plan along with Republicans, I don't know," he said. "It will be very close on some other plan." 
A majority of Senate Democrats have .united behind an alternative plan proposed by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, to restore up to $1,000 a year of tax deductibility for contribu­tions to Individual Retirement Accounts. IRA deductibility ended in 1987 under'.the loop­hole-closing tax law a year earlier that also raised the rate on capital gains. 
House Democratic leaders tried the same IRA substitute, but linked it to an increase in taxes on families with incomes of more than $145,000 a year. 
Mitchell said Senate Democrats will not link their IRA proposal to such an in­crease, but rather will propose to make up revenue lost to ex­panded IRA deductions by ex­tending telephone and other ex­cise taxes that were due to ex­pire at the end of this year. 

Meanwhile, House Speaker Thomas Foley predicted on the same program that the House probably will vote this week to repeal Medicare catastrophic health care coverage that it en­acted last year for some 33 million elderly Americans. 
Many beneficiaries, especially the wealthier among them, have balked at having to pay premiums this year of up to $800 to help cover medical expenses for retirees of more modest means. 
"I hope personally that the program is retained on a modified form," said Foley, D-Wash. "But ... there are a great number of Republicans and some Democrats in the House who are in favor of repeal. If I were guessing today, I think it probably would be repealed." 
Foley also said it is doubtful that Congress will complete action on a deficit-reduction bill, which would include any tax measure, before the Oct. 16 deadline. 
That is the date broad spending cuts in both military and domestic programs would be triggered automatically unless Congress comes up with $6 billion in new revenues or program cuts for reducing the budget deficit for fiscal year 1990, which began Sunday. 
Doctor and wife arrested after sex to_ur of campuses 
Associated Press 
EUGENE, Ore. -A physician and his wife face prostitution­related charges for allegedly conducting a phony research project that included a sex tour of West Coast college cam­puses. 
Rodney Wood, 60, of South Hampton, N.Y., was scheduled to appear in court this week on a charge of promoting prosti­tution; his wife, Nancy Wood, 44, was charged with prostitu­tion, Eugene police Sgt. Rick Gilliam said last week. 
Police say Rodney Wood pho­tographed encounters between his wife and young men. 
A 19-year-old University of Oregon student who allegedly participated in a "research" session with the Woods is also charged with prostitution. 
The couple visited the Oregon campus two weeks ago, telling male students they were "evaluating the sexual potential of the mature female" and would pay participants for tak­ing part in research sessions, Gilliam said. 
Nancy Wood distributed "letters of introduction" ex­plaining the supposed research project to young men on cam­pus, Gilliam said. Men were promised $10 for each orgasm either participant had during the session, he said. 

Police were tipped by two students and an officer, posing as a student, contacted the couple at their hotel. They were charged Sept. 16. 
Police later found a list of schools including Oregon State University, the University of Washington, the University of Victoria, British Columbia, and the University of California at Berkeley, Gilliam said. 
"They were traveling the West Coast with major univer­sities on their itinerary," Gilliam said. "As I understand from a background check in New York, they're real affiuent and giving away this kind of money isn't going to hurt them any." 
"Because there was money exchanged for a sexual act, it was prostitution," Gilliam said. Police believe the couple were not doing sex research for an Oxford University project, as they claimed, but were exercis­ing their own interests, he said. 
The charge of promoting prostitution, a felony, carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $100,000 fine. Prostitution, a misdemeanor, carries a maximum penalty of one year in jail and a $2,500 fme. 
Opposition leader arrested in Panama 
Associated Press 
PANAMA CITY -Ricardo Arias Calderon, a former oppo­sition candidate for vice presi­dent, and eight supporters were arrested Sunday by the Pana­manian police, an opposition coalition said. 
The Civic Democratic Opposi­tion Alliance said in a news re­lease that Arias and eight other members of his Christian Democratic Party were ar­rested while they toured the countryside campaigning for the ouster of Gen. Manuel Nor­iega, the country's military chief who controls the govern­ment.

"We have received news indi­cating that Dr. Arias Calderon will be indicted during the night on charges of inciting civil dis­obedience, subversive activities and public disorder, as well as acting against the economic in­tegrity of the state," the news release said. 
It was signed by Guillermo Cochez and Arellano Lennox, two Christian Democratic Party leaders. The party is a member ADOC. 
Arias Calderon ran as one of two opposition vice presidential candidates in the May 7 na­tional elections on a ticket led by presidential candidate Guillermo Endara. The gov­ernment annulled the returns, which showed the opposition winning by a landslide.

New survey looks at important questions 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Do you put 
on both socks and then both 
shoes, or put a sock and shoe 
on one foot and then the other? 
!low often do you weigh 

yourself! 
When visiting a friend's house 

and the shower curtain is 
dosed, do you look behind it? 
While the better-known poll­

sters are asking Americans 
their political preferences or 
their thoughts on the great is­
sues of the world, a couple of 
New Yorkers are raising ques­
tions that inquiring minds re­
ally want answered. 
"We've always been compul­

sive, obsessive collectors of odd 
tidbits of information. How 
many people wear torn under­
wear under their expensive 
clothes? How many unmatched 
socks lie lonely in dresser 
drawers?" explain Mel Poretz 
and Barry Sinrod in their new 
book. 
Under the modest title ­

"The First Really Important 
Survey of American Habits" -
Poretz and Sinrod have com­
piled the answers to the ques­
tions that have been burning 
holes in their curiosity. 
They found, for example, that 

19 percent of Americans put 
both the sock and shoe on one 
foot first, then the other, as 
opposed to the more common 
way: both socks and then both 
shoes. 
Men were slightly more likely 

to go "sock-shoe, sock-shoe" 
then women. they found. 
After making that leap of faith, readers will learn that:

But the narrow streets around Tiananmen were de­serted as police and soldiers set up roadblocks to keep out all except local residents and those with passes to the square. 
It has been under military guard since soldiers backed by tanks marched on Beijing June 3-4 and drove the students from the square. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people died in the violence.

the younger generation." 
Sumner said that the University complies with state laws and Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) regula­tions that concern the environ­ment. "It's up to Risk Management and the Fire Department to enforce those rules," she said. 
According to Michael McCauslin, environmental health/safety specialist for the department of risk manage­ment and safety, state law pro­hibits smoking in areas near food. "There's no smoking in the dining halls or in food stor­age areas." 
McCauslin was unaware of any campus-wide policy regard­ing smoking, saying that he only deals with issues of safety. "I get involved from the stand­point of flammable materials, laboratories-things like that. We, in conjunction with the Fire Department may restrict smoking because of the pres­ence of flammable materials. 
-Only 7 percent of Americans admit looking behind a closed shower curtain when visiting a friends home and that such surreptitious glances are much more common among women aged 21 and 34, of whom one­fourth say they look behind the curtain. The man most likely to look is aged 45 to 54, they found. with one in 10 doing so. 
-37 percent of Americans never weigh themselves. Some 41 percent of women and 37 percent of men said they never step on the scales. About one in three checks weight weekly, while 14 percent do so more that four times a week. 

-67 percent of Americans say they spend less time in the bathroom than their mate does. The figure was the same for both sexes. 
-38 percent of the people re­sponding say they clean their belly button every day; 20 per­cent say they never do so. 
-53 percent eat spaghetti by winding it on a fork and 47 percent cut it. 
-80 percent eat corn on the cob by going around the ear in the circle; 20 percent nibble from side-to-side, like a type­writer. 
-61 percent say they would wear torn underwear, 39 per­cent would not. Men were slightly more willing to wear the torn item, 68 percent. Only 57 percent of the women said they would. There was this fur­ther breakdown: 7 4 percent of white collar workers said they would wear torn underwear, while only 48 percent of blue collar workers would. 
many were armed with auto­matic rifle and electric prods. 
Joining Deng on the rostrum in Tiananmen were Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and 84­year-old Chen Yun, an ideologi­cal conservative who is rarely seen in public because of his frail health but who is believed to retain influence over major party decisions.

Cow-chip contest survives party pooper

UNION, Ill. -It was banned as bad taste in Marengo, but organizers determined to let the chips fall where they may did just that in a cow-pie con­test complete with cheerleaders urging on the bovine contes­tants.

Organizer Bob Begora was undaunted -"Every party has its pooper," he said. So he got permission to hold the contest Saturday at the Seven Acres Antique Village & Museum, in nearby Union. 
There were no party poopers at the contest, where about 250 people watched from bleachers as one cow at a time wandered a grid marked off in 100 3­foot-by-3-foot squares, Begora said. 
"You put the names (of the ticket-holders) on the square and if the cow poops on your square you win $1,250," Begora said. "On the third drop it landed on a line, so we split the prize between two ticket­holders." 

Begora said 300 tickets were sold at $25 each, so three cows were used for three separate contests. Some people bought tickets from as far away as St. Louis because of the publicity generated when the contest was banned in Marengo, Begora said.

Sneakers banned from work, employees angered by policy 
Associated Press 
EVANSVILLE, Incl.­Managers at Dometic, Inc., sent 20 employees home Friday for wearing white, high-top. tennis shoes against company policy. 
Dometic, which makes small-sized refrigerators for recreational vehicles and hotel rooms, banned the use of athletic footwear two years ago. 
Employees complain that they are not allowed to wea"'r white, high-top tennis shoes to work but black ones am OK if management termed them walking 
SIHH~S. 
··we can wPar their typo of tennis shoes, but not ours and wn think ours arc safer," said John P. Wilkin­son. dirncting business rep­resentative for District 153 of the Machinist Union. 
Not true, said Rick Jones, Dometic personnel man­ager. Jones said the plant's safety rules on footwear had nothing to do with color and that the dispute had been blown out of pro­portion. 
Wilkinson said the work­ers, after meeting with union officials, agreed to change shoes and return to work. But, he said, grievances would be filed to resolve the issue and to re­cover lost wages. 
Wilkinson said the union would take the issue through arbitration if nec­essary. 
"This is the issue that broke the camel's back," he continued. He said the issue was fairness and that Dometic was "talking down to its employees." 
Jones said the company adopted a rule about two years ago banning the wearing of tennis shoes or any footwear designed for athletics rather than fac­tory wear. 
Jones said the rule was adopted after several em­ployees suffered foot in­juries. 
He said the shoe rule does not distinguish be­tween colors or types of material. He said the shoe may be leather, nylon or canvas. He said the design of the shoe was the deter­mining factor. 
If the footwear is a walk­ing shoe or designed for general wear or factory wear, it's OK, he said. If it's designed for playing tennis or other sports, it's not.

We must act to stop deluge of water pollution 
There is an age old urge in 

man that drives him to trace 
the courses of great rivers over 
waterfalls and under bridges to 
follow the unceasing flow of 
moving water until he reaches 
his final destination of the sea. 
There man stops at the coast, 
smelling the scent of the sea's 
mist, touching the cool sparks 
of the waves as they crash 
against the shore, hearing the 
whisper of the grass in the 
durws. 
Since man has such an affin­ity toward water, why is he polluting it'? Texas oil compa­nies receive thousands of per­mits to dispose waste from drilling into the harbors; since 1950, England's Sellafield com­pany has junked "limited" amounts of radioactive wastes into the ocean. Indeed, very rapidly, our veritable bread­basket, the ocean. is becoming a wastebasket. It is time to do something to cure this drastic environmental problem. 
In a successful campaign. we must consider first, what the problem is; second, why the problem exists; and third, how to solve the problem before its effects are irreversible. 
The probltlm: Ocean pollution. The culprits: pesticides, indus­trial poisons, non-degradable wastes, and crude oil. Together these factors are seeping into our ocean and, little by little, are sealing a lid on the ocean's amazing abundance. 
Strip mining promotes poll u­tion. The ocean is paved black with small lumps of mineral aggregate useful to man. Unfortunately, toxins also pave the ocean's floor because these minerals are mined by ma­chines that accidently release wastes. Off Hawaii's Kona Coast the seabottom now con­tains 10 percent cobalt and 90 percent refuse. Is the ocean a breadbasket or a wastebasket? 
The supply of food found in 

DOONESBURY

the ocean is also being depleted due to contamination. On the sandy shores and among the deep waves over 2,000 known species of simple plants and animals live. These marine creatures, among them cod, shrimp. and salmon, provide a constant supply of food. Sixty million tons of fish are caught by man annually. The sea's real abundance, however, is plank­ton, microscopic forms of crab and seaweed. A single quart of water contains one-half million of them-each majestic wave of the ocean harbors 1,000 seafood cocktails which convert the ocean into a giant pot of chapino. Plankton provide three times the 40 billion tons of car­bohydrates produced by land vegetation. So, why are we al­lowing fluorocarbons to de­stroy the ozone layer, causing plankton to be sun-bleached? 
Examples of how we are pol­luting our oceans abound. When I visited the "Big Apple" during the solid waste crisis New York suffered in 1975, I saw the rotten core of the pol­lution problem-sewage crates being filled up with wastes to be dumped out at sea. Near Boston, Quincy, the "Flounder Fishing Capital of the World," could now easily be termed "Sewage Spot Off the Cape." From Trieste, to the Irish Sea, to the Sea of Japan, ships in transit dump up to six million tons of waste yearly-dumping which is not accidental. 
The truth of the matter is that the sea can no longer ab­sorb this lethal cocktail of in­dustrial, urban, and agricul­tural wastes. Jacques Cousteau warned, "Poisoning the sea will inevitably poison us." Indeed, we are killing the plant life and murdering marine animals. 
Why does this pollution prob­lem exist? For one, perhaps people are unaware of the problem. Since man has been condemned to live on land, over the centuries he has lost con­tact with the vast sea kingdom below and often forgets its im­portance. The ancient Hawaiians worshipped the sea. 
'The truth of the matter is that the sea can no longer absorb this lethal cocktail of industrial, urban, and agricultural wastes.' 
Industrial tycoons argue that the ocean is immense, its seven seas encompassing 71 percent of the planet's entire an~a. and thus able to absorb wastes easily. Besides, they say, the bacteria in the water are able to use oxygen to decompose nature's wastes, such as mud, silt, and excretion, that taint the ocean. 
While this is true, the earth has not learned to adapt to synthetic products foreign to its environment. like plastics and detergents. In addition, nu­trients in sewage cause deadly algae blooms, or "Red Tides" that deprive bacteria of needed oxygen. Therefore, we must worry about contamination be­cause the ocean is not a vast, bottomless pit and it can no longer continue to be the dead end for our waste products. 
Besides man's lost contact with the sea, people who are surrounded by man-made ob­jects have also lost that re­spectful awe for the ocean. Municipal wastes account for 70 percent of the ocean's man­created pollution, yet people are reluctant to pay for treat­ment plants, like San Diego's Point Lobos, that overhaul mu­nicipal wastes. Even more frightening than lost respect for the sea, developing soci­eties, experiencing an explosive growth in industry and popula­tion, automatically produce more non-degradable sub­stances. 
Finally and most importantly, how can we take immediate ac­tion against ocean pollution? The answer is simple. Stop the 
causes of contamination. 
Unfortunately, the "immediatl~ 
action" part is the dincher. 
Yet, concerned eitizens can 
start by supporting interna­
tional organizations like 
Greenpeace, or by contributing 
to the Environmental 
Protection Agency. People 
should actively lobby their con­
gressmen to legislate heavy 
fines on those corporations 
that pollute the waters, and to 
create tax incentives for treat­
ment and sewagt~ plants. 
Again, it is important that w1~ understand what tlw problem is, why it exists, and how we can solve the problem in order to take imnwdiate action against water pollution. This is my world; this is your world. Don't we want to lwhold the ocean in the future as Jimerson onct~ did, "As the opalirw. the plentiful. and strong sea, full of food. nourislwr of kinds." as a bountiful bnmdbasket, and not a wastebasket'!

And the Texas Rangers' more strikeouts. 
There was a possibility the game may have been Ryan's last, since he said he will decide after the season whether he'll retire. In fact, a press confer­ence was called for Arlington, Texas, on Monday. 
After the game, he implied that his decision was imminent, saying, "Yeah, I'm leaning one way." 
He would shed no additional light on his future after Saturday's game. However, it would be very surprising if Ryan decided to quit now, con­sidering his success this season (16-10, 3.20 ERA) and the fact that he has lost little if anything off his 95 mph fastball. 
If he does decide to retire, it likely would be because of off­the-field considerations, such as making more time for his family. 
"If he decided to leave, it would not only be a loss for the Rangers, but a loss for base­ball," said Texas Manager Bobby Valentine, who would probably like to see Ryan pitch until the turn of the century. 
Ryan's mastery of the Angels, whom he defeated 3-0 at Anaheim Stadium with a three­hit, 12-strikeout performance earlier this year, certainly didn't look like it should be a swan song for an aging athlete.

Irish accomplish goal in National Catholics 
By BARBARA MORAN 
Sports Writer 
The women's cross country team got its wish last Friday, linishing in the top five at the National Catholics. 
The Irish, who had hoped to bPtter th1~ir sixth place finish of last year, took fifth in a field of 21 teams with a total score of 
132. Providence College won the meet easily. taking four of the top five spots and finishing with a score of only 16. Hounding out the top five were Boston College with 83 points, DePaul with 102 and St. Thomas with 1 04. 
Siohhan Gallagher crossed the line first for Providence, completing the 3.2 mile course in a time of 18:14. Lucy Nusrala finished first for Notre Dame and 15th overall with a time of 19:14. 
Two Notre Dame women, in addition to Nusrala, ·finished in the top 25. Amy Blaising, run­ning only her second race for the Irish, finished a surprising 23rd in 19:42. Blaising was fol­lowed closely by teamate Therese Lemanski. who finishnd 24th with a time of 19:4 7. 
Irish coach Tim Connelly was pleased with his team's per­formance. 
"We were looking to improve from last year and that's what we did," he said. "Lucy Nusrala had the potential to be up higher. She just ran out of gas, but she ran a good race. I can't help but be pleased with Amy IBlaisingl and Therese !Lemanski!. We ran well as a team, and overall I'm pleased with the way the race went."

ND soccer-A Tate of Two Teams 
The Irish have another reason to be happy besides their top five finish: they soundly de­feated the two MCC teams who competed in the meet. Detroit finished 1Oth with 264 points, while Marquette took 13th place with a score of 309. Still, Connelly was hesitant in pre­dicting a first-place finish for the Irish in the MCC meet. 
"I was glad to see the wins over Detroit and Marquette," said Connelly, "but Dayton is the team to beat in the MCC's and they weren't here." 
Notre Dame will not have their chance to meet up with Dayton until the MCC league meet, but will next compete this coming Friday at the Notre Dame Invitational, which will begin at 1PM on the Burke Memorial Golf Course.

Our classroom 
By KEN TYSIAC 
Sports Writer 
In two games this weekend, the Notre Dame soccer team looked like two totally different teams, despite dropping both of its games by identical 3-1 scores. 
The Irish started out Friday night by playing very well against the defending national champion Indiana lloosiers. Despite the loss, Notre Dame managed to keep the match fairly even against the heavily favored Hoosiers. who are cur­rently ranked sixth in the coun­try. 
But Sunday afternoon, although the outcome was the same, the performance was radically different. Notre Dame appeared tired and sluggish in a 3-1 loss to a Wisconsin squad which was talented. but should not have dominated the game as completely as it did. 
Friday night the Irish drew a Krause Stadium record crowd of 2, 7 41 for their game against the Hoosiers. They responded to the impressive turnout by giving Indiana a run for its money, playing good defensive soccer the whole game, control­ling midlield fairly effectively, 
and  keeping the flow  of play  
fairly even.  
Unfortunately  for  coach  

Dennis Grace's squad, the Hoosier front line is probably the best in the country, and its ability to put the ball in the goal made the difference in this game. All-American forward Ken Snow was devastating, as­sisting on Indiana's second goal and thnn scoring the third to put Notre Dame in a big hole. 
Snow won the IIermann Trophy, NCAA soccer's equiva­lent to the lleisman. last year, and he certainly showed the Krause Stadium crowd that he deserved it. He skated around defenders effortlessly and made several picture-perfect passes to his brother Steve Snow, who is just a freshman, and senior Sean Shapert. 
"There's not a lot we can do to defend against that," said Grace, "We actually had a lot of

territory and a lot of ball con­trol, but no team in the country goes to the goal like they do." 
The statistics support Grace's claim that the Irish played the lloosiers very evenly. The shots were slightly in favor of Indiana at 13-8, while Notre Dame held a 6-2 advantage in corner kicks. But Indiana coach Jerry Yeagley didn't agree with Grace's contlmtion that the game was a close one. 
"I was pleased with the win," admitted Yeagley, "But wt~ should have buried them when we had the chance. With the chances we had, we should have scored three or more goals. But Notre Dame never quits. Down 3-0 a lot of teams would throw in the towel. so they deserve a lot of credit." 
Jim Crockford scored early for the Hoosiers, heading in a perfectly driven corner kiek from Sean Shapert at the 13:10 mark. Just under eight minutes later, Indiana struck again, as Steve Snow warded off a de­fender just outside the penalty area and left the ball for brother Ken. who threadPd tlw ball through Irish ddrnders to teammate Chad Deering, who booted a shot into the low~r right-hand corner of the goal. 
Ken Snow scored to make it 3-0 at halftime, and then the Hoosiers went into a bit of a defensive shell to protect their lead. Indiana had a fpw ehanet~s in the second half, but Notre Dame forward Kevin Pendergast was tlw only orw who was able to capitalize, rounding out the scoring with 
11:27 left in the game. 
"I think we played well," said Grace. "That was a drfending National Championship team out there. I'm proud of our dr­fense. We didn't stop tlwm a couple of times whnn Wf~ should have, but they didn't get goals a couple of timns when they should have. It was important for a young team lik£~ ours to come back and score when we were down 3-0." 
Grace was nowlwm near as P.nthusiastic after losing 3-1 to Wisconsin on Sunday. llis team was outhustled and outplayed on the way to being outshot 20­
7. Nonetheless. they managed to keep the score even until late in the second overtime. when Jeff Schiedemeyer volleyed tlw ball past Irish keeper Danny Lyons and into the goal. 
There was some controversy on the goal, as the officials ruled that a Badger forward was offsides, but sincP. lw wasn't involved in the play, the goal was allowed to stand. Although he wasn't happy with the call. Grace said that he was not about to attribute the loss to the poor work of the refpr­ees. 
"You never blanw losses on officiating," statml Grace, "We probably just did not play as well today as we are capabiP of playing." 
The lone bright spot in tlw match for tlw Irish was Kevin Pendergast's team-leading sixth goal which tied tlw scorP at 1-1 at :{I :04 of tlw lirst half. Pendergast took a pass out on tlw right wing and lwat a Badger defender bdore blast­ing the ball behind tlw Wisconsin ktwper. 
After a scoreless second half, tlw game went to two, 15­minute ovt)rtinw pPriods. Nobody seored in tlw first owr­tinw, but Schiedmneyl'r linally broke through for Wisconsin halfway through tlw second. lsmanl Oza111w <tdded an insur­an('( goal for tlw BadgPrs with 
5:10 remaining after Grace had puiiPd Lyons out ol' the rwt and moved Daw Augustyn to k1~epPr in order to bolster tlw ofTPnsP. 
"I wish I had somPthing mon positivi' to say about this ganw," lamentt~d CracP. "All I can say is that WP am going to IParn from this."

'Dawg Pound' call upsets Reeves 
Associated Press 
Maybe the Cleveland Browns were a little lucky. But just the same, the refs are in the Dawg­house with Denver coach Dan Heeves. 
With the wind at his back, Matt Bahr kicked a 48-yard field goal that barely cleared the crossbar on the final play of the game Sunday, and Cleveland ended its 15-year los­ing streak to Denver with a 16­13 victory. 
Bahr had the wind with him because the two teams were asked to change ends of the field early in the fourth quarter. 
The refs made the switch after the Broncos, pinned at their own 4, were pelted with dog biscuits and other junk from the "Dawg Pound," a por­tion of the Cleveland bleachers so named for the fans' love of their Dawg defense. 
Bahr said the field goal cleared the crossbar by "one or two coats of paint." 
"Do you think that makes a difference when you're trying to make a 48-yard field goal with the wind at y.our back?" Heeves asked. "Heck yes, it makes a difference. 
"I wanted to see unsports­manlike conduct penalties called until they stopped. I thought we were only going to play one play at the other end of the field. I had no idea Cleveland would have the wind at their back for the entire sec­ond half." 
Rams 13, 49ers 12 
Mike Lansford kicked a 26­yard field goal with two sec­onds to play and the Los Angeles Rams foiled another

San Francisco fourth-quarter comeback. The Rams remained unbeaten at 4-0, while San Francisco lost its first game. 
Giants 30, Cowboys 13 
Phil Simms overcame three interceptions with two touch­down passes, and the Giants have won their first four games for their best start in 21 years. The winless Cowboys, mean­while, plunged to their worst start since 1963. 
Colts 17, Jets 1 0 
Clarence Verdin returned a punt 49 yards for the winning touchdown as the Indianapolis Colts (2-2) overcame a 1 0-point New York lead. New York is 1­3.

Bengals 21, Chiefs 17 
Linebacker Leon White ran 22 yards untouched and almost unnoticed on a fourth-quarter fumble return, boosting Cincinnati (3-1) over the aston­ished Chiefs. 
Redskins 16, Saints 14 
Chip Lohmiller kicked three field goals and Gerald Riggs scored a touchdown on a 9­yard run as Washington (2-2) beat New Orleans (1-3). 
Seahawks 24, Raiders 20 
Dave Krieg threw a 19-yard touchdown pass to Brian Blades with 9:58 to play, putting Seattle ahead to stay. Krieg, who completed 22 of 31 passes for 227 yards without an interception, had two touch­down passes, and Blades had seven receptions for 113 yards. 
The touchdown was the sec­ond for Seattle in the fourth quarter. Curt Warner scored on a 6-yard run with 14:02 left, capping an 80-yard, 10-play drive. 
Women sweep pair in weekend soccer 
By COLLEEN HENNESSEY Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's soccer team raised its record to 5-6 this weekend by defeating both Indiana and Michigan at home. 
The Irish took an early lead Friday night against Indiana when freshman Marta Roemer scored off a Mimi Suba assist at 5:22 of the first half. 
Notre Dame continued to dominate, adding two more goals before halftime. Junior striker Suba recorded another assist 13 minutes later when her corner kick found sophomore Heather Murphy in front of the Hoosier goal. 
Murphy herself had an as­sist at 36:39 of the first half when she sent a long lead from the left touchline to last season's leading scorer, sophomore Susie Zilvitis, who, all alone 20 yards out, was able to slam the ball past Indiana keeper Laurie Sager. 
Indiana threatened early in the second half, but quickly lost steam against the relentless· Irish offense. 
K.T. Sullivan added the final Irish score with 36:15 left in the second half when she re­directed a Bernie Holland shot into the net. Ten minutes later, Indiana's Charna Adamson ruined Notre Dame keeper Michelle Lodyga's shutout with a header off a corner kick. The score did not matter, however, as the Irish won 4­1. 

"We really controlled the whole game," said senior co­captain Sullivan. "We just worked very well together." 
Sunday afternoon, the Irish had it together again, edging past Michigan by a 
score of 4-3. Despite the close score, Notre Dame controlled the action. 
"We probably could have scored a few more goals," said Sisolak, "but we felt pretty good. We were in con­trol." 
Marianne Giolitto scored first for the Irish, and Sullivan added a point on a penalty kick. Suba recorded her third assist of the week­end when senior co-captain Joy Sisolak headed in her corner kick for her second goal of the season, leaving freshman Margaret Jarc to round out the Irish scoring with an unassisted goal. 
"We had it down at their end most of the time (against Michigan)," said Sullivan. "When they scored, it was really on our mental errors." 
One of the Michigan goals came on a penalty kick, the result of a Notre Dame handball in the penalty area. 
"We did well, considering we haven't had a lot of scoring lately," Sullivan said.

Kansas State still celebrating win 
Associated Press 
MANHATTAN, Kan. -The 
losing  streak  is  history  at  
Kansas State, and  so  are  the  
goalposts.  

In one of the wildest, most improbable finishes any foot­ball game ever provided, the Wildcats of Kansas State put an end to their 30-game winless streak Saturday with a 20-17 defeat of North Texas, No. 1 in Division 1-AA. 
"One thing I've learned here at K-State that's going to make me a better person is that I'll never quit," said guard Chad Faulkner, a senior who before Saturday had never left a col­lege ~eld a winner. "It was un­n~al. 
The Eagles of North Texas were outplayed all day and vic­tory -at last -seemed within reach of the Wildcats. They were leading 14-10 and had the Eagles staring at fourth-and­19 from the K-State 4 7 less than two minutes left. A long­suffering crowd of about 26,000 came to its feet as Eagle quarterbac"k Scott Davis scrambled for one last despera­tion heave. 
Twice Davis was almost 
sacked. Then he launched the ball as hard as he could and Carl Brewer snatched it away from two defenders as he fell into the end zone. 
It appeared the curse of K­State was alive. 
The winless streak would reach 31 games. The losing streak would hit 17. National embarrassment would deepen. 
North Texas confidently kicked off. The Wildcats then had 1:35 in which to go 85 yards. 
What were the odds? 
Whatever they were, Carl Straw beat them. He whipped the Wildcats downfield in nine plays, with wide receiver Michael Smith accounting for 76 himself and helping Straw overcome two sacks. 
Then, from the 12 on what everybody knew would be the last play, Straw threw a perfect strike to Frank Hernandez streaking across the middle. Hernandez stepped into the corner of the end zone, and a roar went up from the crowd that one player later described as "kind of scary." 
A melee erupted. Jubilant fans who hadn't tasted victory since October 1986 mobbed coaches, players and each other. They didn't even attempt the extra point. Within minutes, both goalposts were collapsing.· 
Straw, who replaced starter Chris Cobb in the second quar­ter, swears he knew all along the Wildcats would win. 
"In my career, 15 years, that was the first time I had a per­fectly clear head. I had no doubt that we were going to win that game," he said. "Even when they scored, I knew we were going win it because this team had gone too far to lose a game like that." 
First-year head coach Bill Snyder, an island of calm in an ocean of happy frenzy, said lit­tle thought was given to going for a tying field goal. He also admitted that Straw came close to being benched before the fi­nal drive. 
"I came within an eyelash of replacing Carl because of some of the mistakes he made," Snyder said. 
Twenty minutes afterward, Straw was still wiping tears from his eyes. 
"Sorry, fellas, but I'm still kind of emotional," he said. "But for the rest of my life, no matter what happens, I don't know what could ever be a greater feeling than this." 
Big Ten splits in non-conference

They lost to the mighty, the Notre Dames and Miamis of Florida. 
They beat the less than mighty, the Tulsas and Miamis of Ohio. 
And. after a month of 30 non­eonference football games, the Big Ten is 15-15, an even .500.

No. 20 Illinois, Wisconsin and Northwestern were idle. 
In East Lansing, Mich., Michigan State coach George Perles had nothing but praise for Miami's defense. 
"I would say that's one of the best defensive lines around," Perles said.

Brown 
continued from page 20 
"He's just too good a tight end to try to stiek a linebaeker on him and cover him all over the field," said junior tailback Ricky Watters. "That's why he was getting wide-open." 
Purdue learned that lesson the hard way. Brown caught three passes in the first half, all of which lead to Irish touch­downs. 
On his first catch, quarter­back Tony Rice scrambled until he found Brown wide-open across the field. The play re­sulted in a 27 yard-gain that put the Irish at the Purdue 11­yard line. 
Rice connected with Brown 
for 23 yards on Notre Dame's 
next series. Two plays later, the 
Irish were in the end zone. 
Brown's most impressive play 
might have been the third 
cateh, which started with Notre 
Dame at its own 44-yard line. 
Rice's pass· to'· Br6wn. trayeled 
about six yards, then Brown 
dodged a tackler early and 
turned the play into a 38-yard 
gain.· 
"He ran good routes, caught 
the ball and ran physically," said Holtz. "We've known he could do that. It was just a question of getting him the ball." 

After setting up touchdowns during the first half, it looked as though the 6-foot-7, 235­pounder would score one in the third quarter. 
Brown caught a pass at about the Purdue five yard-line but fumbled and moved ahead, but he fumbled the ball on the two-yard line as the Boilers re­covered. 
"I gave it second effort, and I 
didn't have too much pressure 
on the ball," said Brown, whose 
first collegiate reception was a 
touchdown catch against 
Purdue last year. "When I got 
hit, the ball popped out." 
That mistake resulted in a 
short lecture from Holtz. 
"I know he wanted to put the ball in the endzone, but still we've got to remember to be more conscious of protecting the football," Holtz said. "Derek Brown is really a fine tight end." 
Brown proved that again last 
weekend. The Boilermaker de­
fense can only wish they 
wouldn't always be around 
when the Irish choose to throw 
to him. 
In Ann Arbor, Mich., Michigan quarterback Elvis Grbac completed his first five passes, two of them for touch­downs. 
"I worked hard in practice all week and I think the guys have confidence in me," Grbac said. 
Big Ten teams begin confer­ence play next Saturday, with Ohio State at Illinois, Northwestern at Indiana, Michigan St. at Iowa, Wisconsin at Michigan and Purdue at Minnesota.

Wrigleyville ready for NL playoffs 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -When the lights go on at Wrigley Field this week for tlw first time in post­season play. Angela Dombi and her roommate will trot their TV out onto their porch a half­block from the ballpark to cheer wildly for the Cubs. 
Not Wrigley neighbor Charlotte Newfeld. Nnwfeld wants rain. Lots of it. 
While vendors prepare for Cubs fans by the thousands for Wednesday's night game against the San Francisco Giants and taverns stock their bars for the same, Wrigleyville, the quiet, gentrified neighbor­hood surrounding the ballpark, also readies. 
But nobody's quite sure what they're readying for. 
The Cubs, who won their divi­sion in 1984, last appeared in the World Series in 1945 and last won the Fall Classic in 1908. 
Nobody expected the Cubs to get this far. After a dismal spring that left the National League team with nine victories and 23 losses. everyone ex­pected the worst. The Associated Press, The Sporting News and Inside Sports all pre­dicted the Cubs would finish fifth in their division. 
Said Steve Wulf of Sports Illustrated: "The Cubs ... have had only one winning season since 1972. You can be certain this will not be their second." 
For another thing. Wrigley Field has never hosted a playoff game at night. In 1988, the venerable stadium became the last in the major leagues to turn the lights on baseball. 
Newfeld, president of a group anachronistically called "Citizens United for Baseball in Sunshine," said her group's so rattled. they have demanded a meeting with Mayor Richard M. Daley. 
"Noise. Congestion. Hevelers. It's an impossible situation," she said. 
"Best case scenario: it rains." 

Police and sanitation workers say they're ready. planning roughly the same type of backup they do for other night games. But police won't give any more details. And the two aldermen whose wards are nean~st the ballpark say they'll be monitoring the situation 
closely.
