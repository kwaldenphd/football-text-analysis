The greased zucchini toss and the green baton relay race highlighted the Zucchini Olympics at the seventh and final International Zucchini Festival. Dixie Gurrian, a spokeswoman for the Zucchini Central Committee, ex­plained organizers spent nine months planning the festival. "We're all pooped," she said. Saturday's event, she said, raised between $14,000 and $15,000 for the Harrisville Children's Center and the Grand Monadnock Arts Council. More than 1,000 people showed up at Keene State College for the fun. Some zuke fans were squashed by the decision not to hold the festival next year. -Associated Press 
Actor Paul Newman will portray the late Earl Long in a movie about the Louisiana governor's romance with former striptease artist Blaze Starr, according to a writer who helped Starr with her autobiography. Ron Shelton, writer and director of this summer's hit movie "Bull Dur­ham," will direct the movie, to be titled "Blaze," Huey Perry said. "We've been working with Ron since 1981 and sometimes I thought the story of Blaze would never reach the screen," Perry said. Last week, Shelton told a Bal­timore newspaper that the movie has a budget of $50 mil­lion to $60 million. The movie will focus on the part of Starr's 1974 autobiography that discusses her love affair in the late 1950s with the populist governor known as ''Ole Earl." The affair took place while Starr was a stripper on Bourbon Street in New Orleans before she moved to Baltimore and gained a national reputation. -Associated Press

If the second cup is passed to you while you're struggling to hit the first one, take a drink. If you miss the teacup, take a drink. Since this game is played as rapidly as possible, there are quite a few drinks to take. Of course, if your glass is empty, you can always lick up the small lake of beer that has accumulated from spilt glasses. 
I watched six people go through six pitchers in about an hour. 
Random comments I have heard lately either at parties or in conversations about the alcohol policy:

Saint Mary's College has hired three new Resident Directors to the Residence Life staff. Resident Director posi­tions in Holy Cross, LeMans, and McCandless halls have recently been filled. 
The new directors are Amy Dimberio in Holy Cross Hall, Amy Bertucci in LeMans Hall, and Doreen Martinez in McCandless Hall. 
Dimberio, a 1987 graduate of Saint Mary's, said she feels that her previous experience as a Resident Advisor and her ex­perience working with people have prepared her for her new job as director of Holy Cross. 
"I'm glad to be back. I enjoy working with students and the Saint Mary's community. I am interested in what students think and I'd like to hope that when they have a problem they can come to me," Dimberio said. 
Dimberio said her main re­sponsibility is to supervise res­ident advisors in Holy Cross Hall. "I would hope I am here not only to supervise but to ed­ucate RA's as well as stu­dents," Dimberio added. 
Bertucci, a 1986 graduate of Saint Mary's, said she gained experience as a Resident Birector at Duquesne Univer­sity in Pennsylvania, where she supervised a building of 600 male and female students. 
Bertucci said her goal this year is to build a sense of com­munity in LeMans Hall. 
According to Lissa Van Beb­ber, Director of Residence Life and Housing, Martinez's en­thusiasm and her experience as a Resident Director at West Virginia University landed her the job as director of McCand­less Hall. 
While speaking of Martinez, Van Bebber said, "I was im­pressed with her amount of en­thusiasm. She really wanted the job and was excited about working in the area. I was also impressed with her under­standing of women and the problems they can aquire through alcohol abuse and eatin disorders."

Former US sergeant faces spy charges 
Associated Press 
FRANKFURT, West Germany--Soviet bloc agents may have had access to NATO defei'\Se secrets at a U.S. Army base for decades before a former U.S. sergeant was charged with spying there, a West German newspaper said Sunday. 
West Germany last week an­nounced the arrest of former rad, who since the late 1970s allegedly sold classified infor­mation from the Army base in Bad Kreuznach. 
Officials said Conrad, 41, revealed secrets about nuclear missile bases, pipeline systems and troop strength to Hun­garian agents, who passed them on to the Kremlin and other Soviet bloc countries. 
But the spy ring may have been receiving NATO informa­came active, according to the Welt am Sonntag newspaper, which quoted information from unidentified U.S. investigators.

It said Conrad's predecessor was a U.S. military officer of Hungarian descent who sold NATO information to Hun­garian agents.

"There is the fear that for from Americans in West Ger­many," the newspaper said.

CHICAGO--Hooded Ku Klux Klansmen preaching white supremacy staged a rally Sun­day near a multiracial gather­ing commemorating Martin Luther King Jr., as hundreds of club-carrying police tried to keep the crowds under control. 
The atmosphere was tense in Marquette Park, where similar rallies set off violence and resulted in 17 arrests two years 
"We had no idea that we'd both be here on the same day, but we are damn proud to be here for the white race," an unidentified klansman wearing a white hood told an all-white crowd of about 500. Some mem­bers of the crowd held Nazi flags and wore "White Power" T-shirts. 
A line of uniformed policemen and wooden bar­riers kept the crowd about 40 feet from the stage.

When the original alcohol policy went into effect five years ago, Griffin said, it re­quired "a lot of adjustment on part of the people here." The new policy is again "something we're all going to have to adjust to," she said. 
"I hope people understand the University is constantly trying to find ways to develop good attitudes on this very serious American situation of alcohol and other drugs and overcome or diminish the dis­astrous effects of overuse and abuse," Scully said. "Sometimes I think that's lost in the shuffle." 
"I don't want to see people 
get bogged down in whether 
this is a good rule or a bad rule

Jackson's message defeated by racism 
While I was flipping between baseball games on television this summer, I stumbled upon the Democratic Na­tional Convention. A reporter was on the floor interviewing a Jesse Jackson delegate while someone's speech was droning in the background. The reporter asked the delegate if she thought Jackson had a chance to win the nomination (Obviously, the inter­view took place early in the week). The delegate looked calmly into the camera and said, "No." When asked why she thought he had no chance, the woman replied, "Because he is black." 
Tom Varnum 
third and long 
At first, I thought this was just a case of sour grapes. I believed the delegate was simply bitter about the Dukakis victory in the primaries. I quickly dis­missed her as a sore loser and put the baseball game back on. 
But I could not stop thinking about what she said. Perhaps she was not just a sore loser, perhaps she had a valid point. Perhaps Jackson's candidacy was an exercise in futility. Perhaps our country was still prejudiced. Is America mature enough to accept a black presidental candidate? 
In 1984 Jackson's candidacy was a novelty. He was looked at as a child playing among adults. The other can­didates smiled at him and patted him on the head. None of them even remotely considered him a viable can­didate. Throughout the primaries, Jackson picked up a few delegates here, a few delegates there and earned a hearty, "Well done, Jesse," from the national committee. 
Mter Fritz Mondale got crushed by the Old Man in the general election, Jackson set his sights on 1988. Unlike the other aspiring candidates, he did not rest on his laurels. While others were taking bimbo cruises and plagiarizing speeches, Jesse built on the foundation he created in 1984. He spread his message of the American Dream to the poor and down-trodden, asking them to remain hopeful and re­member him in 1988. And they did. 
Jackson marched into Atlanta this summer with Shermanesque force. He had the power to make or break the election. If he played ball, the Democrats had a legitimate shot at wrestling the office from the GOP. If he took his delegates and went home, the man born with a silver foot in his mouth would be a shoe-in to take the prize. Fortunately, Jesse played ball. This year the committee said, "Thank you very much, Jesse," and went about its business. The question is, what hap­pens in 1992? If Jesse continues to build his Rainbow Coalition, will he reach the pot of gold and win the nomination? Can Jackson become president in 1992? 
Most political experts think not. They cite his lack of experience, dubious ac­quaintances, and lack of a major fin­ancial backing. They fail to mention that he is black. Many say the color of his skin has nothing to do with his in­ability to win the election. For them I have one question: If Jackson were white, would he have been the presiden­tial nominee this year? 
Count on it. He was a few vital states away from winning it anyway, and most people voted for Dukakis because they did not want to vote for Jackson. And why didn't they want to vote for Jackson? Because he is black, that's why. 
Your basic voter does not know of Jesse's relationships with such contro­versial figures as Yasser Arafat and Fidel Castro. Nor does your basic voter care anything for experience. Your basic voter is swayed by the message the candidate sends out. In 1988 no one could touch Jackson's message. Rich­ard Gephardt, Al Gore and Paul Simon had no message and dropped out. Joe

Eiden had someone else's message and was quickly dispatched. Gary Hart delivered his message with his pants down and was also eliminated. Mike Dukakis had a message: I can do for America what I did for Massachusetts. It was catchy and it worked, but it couldn't hold a candle to "Keep Hope Alive!" Jackson's message and delivery were far and away superior to Dukakis', yet Dukakis is the nominee. Why? Money? Maybe. Money, however, cannot buy votes. Just ask Pat

Robertson. Jackson lost because he is black. 
It bothers me that over 130 years after the Emancipation Proclamation and twenty years after the Civil Rights Act, America still cannot stomach the idea of a black president. No matter what anyone says, we are still bigots at heart. Today racial unrest on college campuses is a major problem. Violent attacks with racial overtones were and are commonplace. Last year at the Uni­versity of Massachusetts, black stu­dents were refusing to go to classes be­cause they were afraid of being attacked by white students. Blacks locked themselves into campus build­ings demanding protection. At the Uni­versity of Michigan, similar, yet less severe, events unfolded. Here at Notre Dame, a 1987 Bookstore Basketball game erupted into a racial shouting match. America is still a divided na­tion. Jackson's Rainbow Coalition is at­tempting to bridge this gap. His mes­sage preaches hope and equality for all. But until people listen to his message and stop looking at the color of his skin, he has no chance to be elected. The delegate in Atlanta knew it. You know it. I know it. 
We must make a conscious effort to bridge the racial gap. Whether you use a "rainbow" or a simple handshake, it doesn't matter. It can and must be done. As Jackson would say, there is hope. Twenty-five years ago Rosa Parks was arrested because she refused to move to the "colored" sec­tion of the bus. As a symbol of how far we have come, she stood on the podium at the Democratic National Convention on national television. It can be done. 
Just because "The Cosby Show" is number one doesn't mean racism is dead. It still thrives in the neighbor­hoods of large cities (New York, Bos­ton, Washington, Philadelphia) where there are places blacks or whites fear to tread. It thrives on college campuses where the brightest young minds of our nation still stoop to racial slurs. But most of all, it thrives in the average American who cannot vote for a black president.

Yanks struggle on the coast 
Associated Press 
ANAHEIM, Calif.--The New York Yankees continued their California collapse Sunday as the Angels beat them 13-2 be­hind Tony Armas' four hits and swept the three-game series by a combined total of 32-8. 
California trailed the Yankees 6-0 in the third inning Friday night and scored the next 32 runs. Dave Winfield's ninth-inning homer broke a 26­inning scoreless streak. 
The Angels outhit the Yankees by 54-29 in the series. 
Armas had four of Califor­nia's 19 hits. Chili Davis hit a three-run homer in the seventh.

CHICAGO--William "The Refrigerator" Perry was back, smiling again. 
"A couple of more steps," he laughed when he was asked about almost catching up to running back Marcus Allen of the Los Angeles Raiders. 
Perry's return led to one of the lighter moments for Chicago fans in the Bears' Friday night 37-22 pre-season loss to the Raiders. 
The lumbering but quick­footed Perry gave chase after Allen caught a screen pass and was weaving away from other tacklers. 
It was Perry's 1988 debut. 
The huge, defensive lineman had gone through a month in treatment for eating disorders. 
"It was good to come back and get in a game before the season opened," said Perry. "Now that I've got a game un­der my belt, I'm looking for­ward to better things." 
Despite his long layoff which included missing the entire summer training camp, Perry played three quarters of the game. He had one tackle and assisted on another. He also put pressure on quarterback Steve Beuerlein several times. 
"It didn't feel like no other 
game," said Perry, who also 
was making the switch from 
tackle to end. "It was a little

The offense is fine (except for the line) 
By MARTY STRASEN Sports Editor 
If the Notre Dame offensive line thought it was manhandled by the defense in Saturday's football scrimmage at Notre Dame Stadium, you should have heard the beating it took afterward. 
Head Coach Lou Holtz was at least as relentless as his defense. He focused most of his attention on the poor play of the offensive line after the scrim­mage, and only later got around to discussing some im­pressive individual perfor­mances by quarterback Tony Rice, flanker Ricky Watters and tight end Derek Brown. 
"I've been around the game long enough to know that we are really poor up front," Holtz said. "When you try to run the ball straight ahead and you can't get to the line of scrim­mage, you know you're in trou­ble. 
"We're absolutely horren­dous. It's embarrassing. It takes a great deal of courage just lining up in the backfield, because you know you're going to get stuck by four people." 
Whew. 
The offensive front took its worst lumps late in the scrim­mage, when the top offense and the top defense squared off. On one series in the fourth quarter, the first-team offense was thrown for losses on three con­secutive carries up the middle. 
Holtz covered just about every aspect of the young of­fensive line's woes afterward.

NO soccer teams 
Share and share alike 
By PETE GEGEN Sports Writer 
Just like a kid with a newborn baby sister, the Notre Dame men's soccer team had to wonder what the future held when the women's soccer club was promoted to varsity level last spring. 
Would the men's coach, Den­nis Grace, pay less attention to the men as he also coached the women's team? 
Would the guys accept sharing a practice field, and worse yet, put up with sharing drills? 
Well, the team which gets its strength from playing as a fam­ily has accepted its kid sister. 
"It hasn't been any prob­lem," say the players on both teams. 
Even at the dinner table there's no sibling rivalry. Mter a Sunday morning practice both teams headed to freshman Molly Lennon's house for a pic­nic lunch. 
"They've been getting along great together," adds Grace, "very much so." 
Grace's job as coach of both teams is much easier with the harmony on the field. He splits his time equally between the two, starting the women's two­hour practice at 2 p.m. and the men's at 3 p.m. He has the help 
of a new full-time assistant co­
ach, Neil Schmidt, and 
graduate assistant Jim Flynn, 
but sometimes during the hour 
overlap Grace combines the 
teams in drills. 
"Together the men and wo­men are a team," says Grace. 'A Notre Dame soccer team." 
This attitude and the har­mony among the sexes has helped the rookie women's team. 
"They accepted us right away," says junior K.T. Sul­livan. "They're really nice guys and they've helped us out a lot." 
Sullivan, a transfer from Canisius, has helped with the leadership on a team consisting of much of the original club team and a half-dozen fresh­men. She also could be consid­ered the ice breaker for the two teams, when she practiced with the guys for a few days before the women's team started up. 
"They're really hard to keep up with," she said. 
Even though the men have had a week more practice than the women, both teams open their seasons Thursday night at Krause Stadium. The women host Indiana-South Bend at 5:30 and the men take on Loyola (Ill.) at 8. 
physical, very tough or very ~ mature," he said. "We're just not very good on offense." 
Defensively, meanwhile, the Irish were nothing less than dominating. 
The No. 1 teams faced the No. 2 units most of the day, and the top defense did not allow a touchdown. Overall, the defense recorded six sacks, seven tackles for losses, three fumbles caused (two recovered) and two intercep­tions. 
"They looked crisp," Irish defensive coordinator Barry Alvarez noted. "But the defense should be ahead at this stage of the game." 
Cornerback D' Juan Fran­cisco led the way with 11 tackles. Defensive end Darr~ll "Flash" Gordon, who has been playiqg behind sophomore Andre Jones, had 10 tackles on the day. Inside linebacker Donn Grimm also had 10 stops, while Ned Bolcar added nine. 
But the offense was not with­out its outstanding performers as well, especially early in Notre Dame's second fall scrimmage. 
Rice was 14-of-21 for 200 yards, finding his receivers all over the field and also hooking up with tight ends Brown and Frank Jacobs consistently. Rice hit freshman split end Raghib "Rocket" Ismail on plays that went for 45 and 25 yards. 
"For a kid who can't throw, I think he'.s doing well," said Holtz, mocking those who still

Like last year's grueling three-a-day practice sessions, the men's soccer team began practice a week before school started. The practices this year, however, have left the players wishing for a return to those three-a-days. 
With the football team taking over the lighted Krause Stadium at night because of the heat, Grace changed the prac­tice schedule to two long ses­
sions with a three-hour break for lunch. Those sessions, which lasted up to four hours each, seemed like an eternity to the players. "Everyone's really tired," said senior for­ward Bruce 'Tiger' McCourt last week as the single-session practices began. 
Among the most improved players over last season is sophomore midfielder Steve LaVigne, who Grace has called the 'player of the preseason.' 
"Steve has just been tough," said Grace. "Nobody's moving him off the ball. He'll do some things this year." 
Grace also noted improve­ment in the play of wingback Paul LaVigne, Steve's twin brother, and in the play of senior keeper Kevin Mayo.

Thomas named golf coach 
Special to The Observer 
George Thomas, the head PGA professional at Elcona Country Club in Elkhart, Ind., is the new men!s and women's head golf coach at Notre Dame. 
He succeeds Noel O'Sullivan, the men's coach for the past 15 seasons, who will serve as director of instruction at the Burke Memorial Golf Course while continuing his duties in the physical education depart­ment. 
Thomas will be assisted in the area of instruction by his son, Joe Thomas, an assistant pro at Elcona, and in adminis­trative areas by Tom Hanlon, a member of Notre Dame's 1944 NCAA Championship team. 
The elder Thomas has been the head pro at Elcona for 23 years and has won seven In­diana Seniors titles, more than any other player. He was the Indiana PG A Player of the Year in 1970, '73 and '77, was president of the Indiana PG A for two years, and is a member
