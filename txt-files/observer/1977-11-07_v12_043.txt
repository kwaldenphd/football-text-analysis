by Anne Bachle 

Dissatisfaction with St. Mary's coverage in the Observer prompted several SMC Board of Governance members to speak out strongly at last Thursday night's meeting. 
One commissioner noted, "We agree our HPC meetings don't always deserve to be on the front page, but we pay for the paper as much as anyone else, and there's no reason why St. Mary's articles are always in the back pages of the paper.'' 
lot of other joint activities we do,'' agreed Senior Class President Nan­cy Mogab. 
Lack of coverage of St. Mary's sports was cited by Sports Com­missioner Amy Hartzell as further evidence of the problem, although Hartzell said she has not spoken with the women's sports editro about it.

SMC Regents approve new library facility 
by MoUy Woulfe 
The resolution to construct a new library was unanimously approved by the St. Mary's Board of Regents at a meeting held Oct. 21. Oth~r resolutions passed were the esta­blishment of a campus police department, a financial plan for 1978-79, and the agreement that the Sisters of the Holy Cross will donate back to the College the annual lease payment for next year. 
Kathleen Rice, dean of Student 
Affairs, commented that the pre­
sent library "lacks space and 
general comfort. "There's no 
lounge area, she explained. 
John Duggan, president of St. Mary's remarked, "We're so crovdednow we don't have room to put all our books on the shelves." He added that the new library will 
be four times larger than the 
current one and "there will be 
comfort.able study rooms, smoking 
areas, display cases, and audio 
visual and rare book rooms." 
According to Duggan, architects have suggested two possible sites for the library: south of Lemans or the present parking lot between LeMans and Regina. 
A fund drive is being planned to 
raise five million dollars to cover 
construction costs and two million 
dollars for a library endowment. 
Duggan expressed the hope that 
the money will come from "mostly 
alumnae." "They are the primary
supporters of the College. They're our main hope, Duggan said.

Credit cards, loans? Not easy for students 
by Bill Delaney 

Thinking about applying for a 
credit card, taking out a loan or 
buying on a time payment plan? If 
you are a college student, you may 
be disappointed. 

In the buy now-pay later world of credit cards and consumer finance, students often find themselves faced with a Catch-22 type of situation. They can't take out a loan or qualify for a credit card without first establishing a credit back­ground. But, in order to estabish a credit background, they must bor­row money or make some sort of credit transaction. 
The problem, according to Paul Hill. loan officer at the South Bend American National Bank, is that banks, stores and credit card companies demand "some kind of previous loan experience" as assurance that their money will be paid back on time. "No one will stick his neck out to get a guy started," he explains. 
The most important factor in deciding whether or not a person is a good credit risk is usually his file at the Credit Bureau, a company that specializes in providing credit information, Hill says. Unfortu­nately, many young people have little or nothing on their file so creditors know nothing about them, he continues. 
If you have some extra money ina savings account, Hill suggests, a good way to begin to build up a file is to take out a loan using the savings as collateral and then deposit the borrowed money in the savings account. The loan goes on file with the Credit Bureau as a · good reference. 
At American National, the pass­book for the savings account is kept under lock and key so that neither the borrowed money nor the collat­eral can be withdrawn, Hill says. The rlisadvanta~e of this method is 
· that the original savings are tied up for a period of time; the money, however, continues to draw interest. One Notre Dame junior used a similar technique last summer to get a Bankamericard. He applied for the card, listing a department, the telephone company and a checking and savings account as references, he said, but was turned down because he was a student. He was able to get a $200 loan on time payments from a bank, however, and paid back the loan over a 
 period of months with the same money that he had borrowed. With this in his file, they were willing to give him the credit card. 
Getting something on file with the Credit Bureau, however, is not always the final solution to estab­lishing credit. "This is just the first step," Hill warns, because "you don't go from a $200 loan on a savings account to a $4000 loan on a new car over night. You've got to crawl before you can walk." 
Credit Bureau files are not the only obstacles in the way of

the past that it is no longer accepted within our industry. Finally, a "half-carat" diamond 
may legally range in size from .43 carats to .57 carats. A small difference perhaps, but would you like to pay for nearly one-tenth of a carat that you're not really getting? Always make sure that you know e:uctly how much your diamond weighs before you sign your check. 
At Diamond Import Company we subscribe to the standards for diamond classification extablished by the Gemological Institute of America. Only Graduate Gemolo­gists such as myself can adhere to these stringent voluntary require­ments. By utilizing this gradation system, any GIA member in the world will be able to consistently grade the color (D thru X), quality ("FL" thru "1-3"), carat weight and cut quality of your diamond. 
Volumes have been written on this subject of diamond classification, so I won't attempt to duplicate them in this column. But if you are interested in knowing more about the nature, pricing and classifica­tion of diamonds, please feel free to get in touch with me.

Neat Distinctions and Silences 
As everyone knows, the 5th Commandment says "Thou shalt not kill." As everyone also knows, we are surrounded by a great deal of killing, much of which is absolved of wrong by the approval and legitimacy of custom and law. In order for this to be done with ease of conscience, a neat distinc­tion is made between human life and all other living things. These latter are considered, for the most part, fair game for the whim and mood of Man. 
Again, we are quite aware of the sort of havoc wreaked on the environment through the disdain for life and existence other than our own which careful and casual distinctions permit. 
As for human life, there are also types of legitimized killings: pun­ishment for heinous crimes, self. defense, 'just wars', and the like. But isn't it unfortunate how fre­quently the proportion is thrown askew, so that the executions eliminate the undesirable rather than correct abuses, people are 
killed to secure and protect things, 
and nations are devastated past 
recovery in the name of such ideals 
as Freedom and Democracy and 
Honor. 

$( ~+lrnes, and not rarely, a 
curious .wist is given to these 
distinctions so that killing becomes 
an act through which God is 
reverenced: witness the Crusades 
and Holy Wars and Just Causes of 
History, licensed by the call to 
defend His perogative (can hu­
mans really defend His honor, His 
dignity and holiness). Or, when 
laurence a. mayer 
religious zeal isn't the justifying cause, the Advancement of Hu­manity itself is appealed to, to permit and even require enormous inhumanity. 
For example, the modern history 
of the people Israel has been marked by massacres ---pogroms ---precipitated by Christians screaming "Christ killers!" or "Jerusalem est peridita!" For as warped reason would have it, the people have been rejected, and what God has rejected can be annihilated with impunity by man. How 'humane' was the intent in Nazi Germany to purify Aryan blood --by the systematic eradica­tion of this 'different' people. 
Not have the jews been the only objects of this way of looking at things; frequently enough the ex­pansion of Western civilization has been accompanied by the slaughter and enslavement of native peoples through the simple expedient of assigning the labels 'non-human' or 'abominable to God'. And after all, why ought one respect non­humans and abominations? 
Do any of these names, these neat terms, sound familiar?· They should. Recall any of the stereo types and catch phrases used by 'majorities' to justify keeping the 'minorities' in their unfree and unequal condition. Ms. Bryant is only a more overt 'prophetess' of a new program, with her insistent Big Lie style of crying "Abomina­tion" at Gays; nor are such words as 'pervert', 'bestial', 'subhuman', etc., foreign to the vocabulary associated with the 'decency' cam­

paign identified with her. 
Words are powerful things, cap­able of catalyzing into action the vague fears and discontents of those who depend on others for their thinking and ideals; and usually, it is to mob action, mindless and impulsive. News reports show that there art.. only too many such listeners willing to find themselves as God's instruments for wiping out 'non-humans' and purging 'abominations'. And by presuming to speak for God and for Humanmity, Ms. Bryant and oth­ers like her give a divinely autho­rized permission. 
As this happens throughout the country, this planting of a terrible self-righteouness, one wonders at the silence of the churches and theologians and the many cham­pions of human rights. Are they hoping "It" (Anita, the phenom­enon of homosexuality, the exis­tence of different people and ideas) will go away? Why do they temporize while the proponents of executing Gays, for instance, shout their gospel, using the Word of God as their foundation? Are these moral leaders afraid to be 'tainted' by speaking out? Are they waiting until it isn't so expensive either in · money or human respect to defend an unpopular cause? 
One wonders what neat distinc­tions justify the killing silences. And one wonders if the God and the Humanity which these present day crusaders and knights -errant refer to is the one that Jesus heard and· unpopularly served.

Lighting Priorities 
Dear Editor: 
T~~ Univ~rsity has t~ke~ strong posttton agamst the untontzation of any one of its employees, but is this position as concrete as it seems to be? Perhaps the University would not be ·so strongly opposed to unionization if it were dealing with a progressive, well respected labor organization. The Teamsters, whose reputation escapes few of us, are not such a class organiza­tion. On the contrary, the Team­sters insist on fragmenting the personnel so as to include only a few !!l"oundskeepers in their local. If benefitting the workers is their only concern, then why not spread their benevolence among other 
, University employees as well? 
I have a feeling that whaf the Teamsters are really after is estab­lishing themselves at Notre Dame. They already attempt to borrow integrity and credibility from Notre Dame's national reputation by advertising during radio broadcasts of Fighting Irish football games. 
We have let an organization with questionable motives and a lack of widespread support create a situa­tion in which the Administration looks bad if it says no to unioniza­tion, and worse if it grants the teamsters the right to organize. What is needed is a solid alterna­tive proposal from a respected union, or an association of campus employees independent of any parent union. If not, the status quo will prevail. 
Stan Aslanian 


Teamsters: Foot in door? 
Dear Editor: 
I have nothing against Notre Dame's Golden Dome, but it seems that things have gone too far when the University purchases new colored lights for it when they will not even pay to light the dark areas of campus. Does that tell us where Notre Dame's priorities lie? I hope not, because if it does, something is wrong. 
For many years, students have been complaining about the poor lighting situation around areas 

DOONESBURY 
such as: the walk south from 
O'Shaughnessy Hall, the Hurley 
Building, and the walk between the 
Church and the Adminfstration Building to Lewis Hall. The many petitions and pleas have not yet s~rved any useful purpose. When wtll the Administration be equally cOQcerned with the needs of the students as well as with the public image of Notre Dame? 
Mary Ann Wissel 
Lab reas­signment unjustified 
Dear Editor: 
I was saddened to read of the University's underhanded action in moving Professor Emeritus James 
P. Danehy from the office and lab that he occupied during thb twenty -six years of employment as a professor of Chemistry at the Universio/ of Notre Dame. 
Aside from further inconvenien­
cing the professor , this unwarran­
ted reassignment of office space 
s~rv~s to embarrass the Univeristy 
wtth tts forced retirement policies. 
Not only does the administration 
waste the services and rob the 
the livelihoods of those affected by 
mandatory retirement, but it acts to 
alienate these people from the 
Notre Dame community altogether. 
A man of Professor Danehy's respected character and high stan­dards and academic acclaim doe­sn't deserve the belittling treat­ment that results from this forced office relocation. 
As a student of Notre Dame, I was able to study under Proffessor Danehy, and I consider myself fortunate to have done so. He was a teacher whose instruction didn't stop with the end-of-class bell. I spent many, many hours in both his private and open tutoring sessions. The attendant consideration and personal attention given to me and many other students by this man will never be forgotten. 
I only ask myself how Notre Dame can expect to be a univer­sally caring community when we have such evidence of thoughtless and uncaring attitudes in our own backyards?

the observer 
by John Mahon Robert E. Lee, a senior member 

'====~:~~ the Federal Communications
(FCC), spoke to approxi­twenty telecommunications 
dents last Thursday. He also met with the WNDU advisory committee to discuss the possibility of expanding their programs and increasing the number of courses in this area of study. 
Lee, a former FBI agent and currently, a commissioner of the FCC, talked to students in the American Studies telecommunica­tions class about the regulative and functional duties of the FCC, as well as his own responsibilities as commissioner. He described the FCC appointment procedure, and explained that he was appointed to his present position by Eisenhower in 1953. 
Currently he is preparing to participate in an international con­ference in Geneva, set for 1779, which will allocate broadccasting frequencies and adjust regulations. 
He described the meeting as "the largest of its kind in 100 years." He is presently the United States representative to the International Telecommunications Union.

telecommunications course is being added to the schedule next semes­ter. WNDU already sponsors internships, but is looking for more avenues of service. 
Also stressed in his talk was the historical background in which FCC regulations developed. He stated that the duties of the ·COmmission lie more in regulative functions than in actual broadcasting. 
He cited the rapid growth of the Citizens'-Band radio as a dramatic example of the problems in trying to ensure adequate regulation. Under the present Fcc rules, all C-B radios must be licensed. Yet over 15 million sets are in use, and only half of them are actually registered. Attempts to bring the situation under control are made difficult by the easy accessibility to CB radios and their ease of operation. 
Issues the FCC must face in the field of television are more contro­versial and bring up the question of censorship. Lee said that some programs are excessively violent and "many good citizens are anxious to bring them under con­trol." 
Yet there are others who approve of the programs and would view regulation attempts as a form of unwarranted censorship. It is a question of trying to determine where bad taste ends and the need for regulation begins, Lee said. 


Lee said that there are "direct local implications resulting from future satellite transmissions.'' NASA has already completed an experimental satellite, the Applica­tion Technology Satellite or ATS-6 and is using it to provide education­al services to people in inaccesible areas like Appalachia. 
One problem with such satellites is that by the nature of their frequencies they may effectively block all telephone communica­tions. Until this problem is solved, the use of television satellites appears unlikely on a local scale. 
In a recent talk to business leaders, Lee predicted a rapid rise in the use of home computers. A system is available today costing $400. If the consumer already has the needed television and cassette player it might cost even less. 
Data storage units are also available for $200 which are able to project newspaper pages onto the television screen. These units involve memory chips and charac­ter generator components. If they follow the same trend as that of pocket calculators they should be available for $20 in a few years, he said. 
Lee predicted the spread of coaxial cables and optical fibers in broadcast transmission to homes from a central base. The use of such cables allows for direct con­tact with the source, and prevents atmospheric static. Over 12 million homes are already hooked up to such systems for television and FM radio reception. The number is expected to greatly increase with advances in the technology of optical fibers. 
Speaking before the Nevada Broadcaster's Association Conven­tion in Lake Tahoe, Lee said, "I certainly don't think our broadcast­ing system will become obsolete because of the technological de­velopments I have been describ­ing." Rather, he feels, the system will be improved and become more efficient.
