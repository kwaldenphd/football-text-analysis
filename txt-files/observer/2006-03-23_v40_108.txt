ND policy upheld by hall tradition 
Adn1inistrators: Greek organizations unnecessary due to current four-year dorm system 
By KATIE PERRY Assistant News Editor 
Editor's Note: This is the second of a three-part series examining the absence of.fra­ternilies and sororities at Notre Dame. 
Greekpages.com "the original. the ddinitive frater­nity and sorority Web site" ­bT>asts listings or 1,680 dis­tinct social organizations at 1,29 I campuses nationwide. Not surprisingly, Notre Dame is not included in this data­base. "But why? 
The immediate reason is dear. fraternities and sorori­ties are explicitly prohibited in the University's rule book, duLac. under its "Student Activities Poli<;ies." 
"The establishment of, or membership in, social frater­nities or sororities is consid­ered contrary to the educa­tional and residential mission of the University and is conse­quently prohibited." 
Though s1uface rationale behind the University's lack of a Greek system -it's against the rules -is widely under­stood by students, the deeper reasoning behind the policy is less clear. Is the principle solely grounded in tradition, or are there additional factors at work? 
Secrets, secrets are no fun 
The Catholic Church has denounced secret societies, or exclusive social groups with rituals involving an oath of allegiance and private cere­monies or events, for more than 260 years. Pope Clement XII first condemned freema-• sonry in 1738 -a sentiment that was later echoed and applied to colleges and other scholastic academies by Pius VIII in 1829. 
The Church has no official doctrine outlawing the pres­ence of fraternities and soror­ities at Catholic universities. And by. virtue of the 1967 "Land 0' Lakes" statement ­created at a conference held between top leaders from Catholic colleges and universi­ties -individual institutions enjoy sovereignty in shaping Catholic character. 
Associate Vice President of Student Affairs Bill Kirk said while the Church's stance on

Notre Datne ranks 4th atnong dreatn schools 
Survey puts ND with Princeton, Harvard 
Special to The Observer 
If it's true that "Mom and Dad know best," the University of Notre Dame is a top choice for college applicants, according to a new survey of prospective students and their parents by the Princeton Review. 
Notre Dame ranks fourth in a survey of some 4,900 students and parents who were asked the question, "What 'dream col­lege' would you most like to attend (or see your child attend) if acceptance or cost weren't issues?" Also included in the top five, in order, were Princeton, Stanford, Harvard and Duke Universities. The institutions most named by stu­dents, in order, were New York University, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford and Yale. 
One of the nation's most selective universities, Notre Dame is the nation's highest rated Catholic university and among the top 20 overall. 
Princeton Review is a New York-based company that sells its services and books to assist college applicants in improving performances on standardized tests and in navigating the admissions process. It is not affiliated with Princeton University.

African 111ission book published 
Historical work by assistant professor examines missionary strategies 
Special to The Observer 
"Evangelization of Slaves and Catholic Origins in Eastern Africa" by Rev. Paul Kollman, C.S.C., assistant professor of theology, recent­
ly was pub­lished by Orbis Books. An unusu­

.al historical study of the Catholic Church in East Africa, Father 

K o ll m a n 's Paul Kellman 
book exam­ines 19th-century French missionary strategies and how they affected Catholicism throughout Africa. 

The missionary priests of the Congregation of the Holy Ghost, or Spiritans, who came to the East African coast during the last half of the 19th century found them­selves working in a society heavily influenced by the Islamic sultanate of Zanzibar and decided to concentrate their efforts on making Christian converts among the societies in the African interi­or. They set about ransom­ing the slaves brought from the interior regions to the coast, attempted to mold coherent Christian communi­ties from these mostly young and culturally diverse people, and met with mixed success and predictably controversial results. 
"I try to take seriously the historical specificity of the Spiritan missionaries who founded the Church in east­ern Africa," Father Kollman said. "I focus on their back­grounds in the seminary and in social service in a 19th~ century France that had new forms of social disciplining emerging. I also studied as closely as possible the avail­able records of the Africans' 
responses to missionary practices. I discern what might be· called resist­ance of various forms, as well as emerging Catholic identi­ty of various forms, not all of which the missionaries appreciated.

at Notre Dame. He teaches and Paul Kellman writes on the author history of 
The shape of Christianity in Africa today looks very dif­ferent from that anticipated by missionaries. Yet the mis­sionaries were not inconse­quential, and the differing ways that Africans are now Catholic can often be related to missionary practices." 
According to a review by Rev. Aylward Shorter, author of numerous books on the Christian evangelization of Africa, Father Kollman's book demonstrates "that the origins of Catholicism in Eastern Africa were complex and that they were the out­come of an interaction between differing mindsets and mentalities. Missionary practices that are easy to judge harshly resulted in the Catholic communities which today embody the Church's mission." 
Father Kollman is a fellow of the Kellogg Institute for International Studies, the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies,

with special interests in African Christianity and mission his­tory. He has taught at Catholic Theological Union in Chicago and the Philosophy Centre in Jinja, Uganda: He has published articles and reviews in African Christian Studies, African Studies, and the Journal of Religion, and he serves as president ofthe Midwest Fellowship of Professors of Mission and book review editor for the Journal of Mission Studies.

Policy 
continued from page 1 
snernt socintins "may have bonn a part of the motivation" for the policy in the past, today's statute is in place for a different reason. 
"It's tiH• nature of our resi­dence hall system that makes Ifraternities and sororities I unnceessary," Kirk said. "You arc a member of the commu­nity simpily by virtue of being placed there." 
Welsh Family rector Candace Carson said Notre Dame's housing system "is a blend of both Catholicism and tradition." Hnsidence halls are communities and not solely social establishments like fra­ternities and sororities, she said. 
"We're not exelusive ­we're inclusive," Carson said. "At Notre Damn you're part of a community when you walk in the door. You don't have to pass any 'test' besides getting into [tho University]. and there's no hazing. You're accepted and that's part of our Catholic nature." 
Creek soeictics are often accompanied with such "nega­tives" as initia-Catholic community on earn­pus without having the dorms set-up that we do, but it is condueive to a sense of tradi­tion," she said. 

Tradition and omission 
The Notre Damn admissions Web site attributes the absence of Greek organiza­tions to "the residential nature of the campus and its. unique stay-hall system, in which students typically remain in the same dormitory for their entire time on cam­pus." Such an arrangement "fosters a strong sense of community," the Web site says. 
"I've heard our residential lil'e [described) as the advan­tages of the Greek system without any of the disadvan­tages -rush, the cliques, deciding on whether you're good enough to join them, monthly 'dues' [and a) much lower diversity of people living together," Director of Admissions Dan Saracino said. 
Keough rector Father Peter J arret said some parallels exist between the Greek sys­tem and Notre Dame's resi­dence hall system, but com­paring the two is a case of "apples and oranges." 
"There are some similari­
ties, [for

Munson said dorm life at say dorm unity and communi­ty is the major goal of the cur­rent dorm system," she said. 
National statistics that link Greek affiliation with habits of "excessive partying" are diffi­cult to consider within the context of Notre Dame since membership or non-member­ship in fraternities and sorori­ties is not an option at the University. But they do indi­cate the negative influences such societies seem to have on college campuses in general. 
A 2001 Harvard School of Public Health College Alcohol study -a national examina­tion of college drinking habits -found fraternity members were far more likely to engage in "heavy" drinking than their non-fraternity peers (75.1 percent versus 48.6 percent). More than 60 percent of sorority members engaged in "heavy" drinking, as com­pared to roughly 40 percent of non-sorority members. 
The Harvard study also said living in fraternity and sorori­ty houses was associated with even higher rates of binge drinking -a statistic that falls in line with a 1999 Core Institute study which found the "largest on-campus ven­ues for drinking" to be Greek houses.

Tourist bus in Chile crashes, 12 dead 
SANTIAGO -A bus carrying cruise ship tourists plunged 300 feet down a mountainside in northern Chile Wednesday, killing 12 Americans, U.S. and Chilean officials said. 
Two other U.S. tourists and two Chileans ­the driver and the tour guide -were hospital­ized in serious condition following the crash along a rugged highway ncar the Pacific port city of Arica, 1,250 miles north of Santiago, said Juan Carlos Poli, an Arica city hall spokesman. 
The tourists were returning to Celebrity Cruises' ship Millennium, docked in Arica, from an excursion to nearby Lauca National Park. 
The driver reported that he lost control of the bus while swerving to avoid a truck approach­ing on a collision course, Poli said. The bus went off the narrow highway and tumbled down a steep mountainside. 
Iraqi forces foil attack on prison 
BAGHDAD -Emboldened a day after a suc­cessful jailbreak, insurgents laid siege to anoth­er prison Wednesday. This time, U.S. troops and a special Iraqi unit thwarted the pre-dawn attack south of Baghdad, overwhelming the gunmen and capturing 50 of them, police said. 
Although the raid failed, the insurgents' abili­ty to put together such large and well-armed bands of fighters underlined concerns about the ability of Iraqi police and military to take over the fight from U.S. troops. Sixty militants participated in the assault, which attempted to free more jailed Sunni insurgents, police said. 
Four police officers -including the com­mander of the special unit -died in a two­hour gunbattle, which was subdued only after American forces arrived. Among the 50 cap­tured, police said, was one Syrian.

Man executed for death of toddler 
HUNTSVILLE, Texas -A man who beat his girlfriend's 2-year-old daughter to death because she was crying was executed Wednesday night. 
"I am sorry the child had to lose her life, but I should not have to be here," Robert Salazar Jr., said in a final statement. "Tell my family I love them all and I will see them in heaven." 
Salazar, 27, was pronounced dead seven min­utes after the lethal dose began to flow. 
Adriana Gomez was killed in 1997. Salazar told authorities he pushed the girl, causing her to fall down and hit her head. 
A pathologist, however, testified that Salazar inflicted injuries on Adriana that were worse than those suffered by victims of auto accidents.

Officials discount terrorism as a motive; New Orleans suspect may be mentally ill 
Associated Press 

LA PAZ -An American man and his Uruguayan girlfriend were arrested Wednesday after bombs severely damaged two low­budget hotels in Bolivia's capital, killing two people and injuring at least seven. 
Police said they believe the pair had "religious motives" for the attack and had plans to bomb the Chilean consulate in La Paz on Saturday, according to Issac Pemintel, the national police chief. 
Police initially said the blasts were "typical of ter­rorist crime," and President Evo Morales lost no time in denouncing them as an attack on Bolivia's democracy. 
"This American was put­ting bombs in hotels," Morales said. "The U.S. government fights terror­ism, and they send us ter­rorists." 
But other Bolivian offi­cials discounted terrorism as a motive, saying the American appeared to be mentally ill. 
"The possible motives behind these attacks are incomprehensible. There don't seem to be any con­crete objectives other than causing deaths," Deputy Interior Minister Rafael Puente told Radio Fides.

would he immediately visible 
-mnrnbers began the slow 
process of amending the intri­
cacies of' the document's lan­
guage t.o ensure that it best 
represented the position of the 
faculty. 
Changes included the dele­tion of a sentence that read, "A principal function of a Catholie university is to encourage exploration of apparently settled doctrine, so that strong belinf's can be reaf­l'irmed and faulty praetices identified," along with similar words or phrases deemed too strong or "needlessly inflam­matory," as described by one member. Also up f'or debate were words with subtle differ­ences of connotation, like "eonfliet." versus "opposition." 
A paragraph addressing the eiTect of "the suppression of controversial ideas," as the statem11nt reads, on artistic expression went through a long period of discussion and several amendments. Program of Liberal Studies professor .Julia Marvin introduced an alternate version to the sec­tion of the paragraph she described as "d iffic uIt to understand." 
The final incarnation of this debated section read, "This chilling effect !referring to a statement made in the previ­ous sentenceI is also of partic­ular concern with respect to artistic expression. Art tends more to raise questions than to provide answers; to forbid tho asking of particular ques­tions curtails the range of pos­sible artistic expression and eviscerates art's intellectual l'orce, rnd ueing it to the status of mer·e entertaining." 
At this point in the meeting -after a period of debate about the adjective "chilling" as opposed to "inhibitory" ­civil engineering and geologi­cal studies professor Jeff Talley said he felt the lan­guage or the entire document was "over the top." 
"!The statement! is so dra­rnatie, it's like rcadi.ng a play ... If' you want the administra­tion to take this seriously, per­haps adjoctives less dramatic than 'chilling' and 'unortho­dox' would be more favorably received," Talley said. 
Salma Saddawi, professional speeialist of' chemical engi­neering, said she thought, "like many of those involved in the sciences," the language should be simple and clear. 
Gail Bederman, professor of history, disagreed, noting she had received many responses froin within her department that said the statement's wording was not strong enough. 


The issue was then raised that the statement was redun­dant in it support of the University's mission statement, and failed to address any spe­cific cases. 
"Nowhere do we state that we support 'The Vagina 
Monologues' ... 
There's an issue

events. 
"If we have something writ­
ten that is general, we won't 
have to come up with a new 
statement every year when a 
new controversy comes up," 
physics professor Philippe 
Collon said. 
"Taking up the issue of' redundancy is missing the point lof the document]." Bederman added. "You may say that we're just repeating and affirming the University's mission statement, but a lot of people read the mission state­ment a different way than we are." 
Barry Keating, professor of 
finance, then suggested the 
statement condoned so broad 
a spectrum of actions that it 
condemned almost any 
University action to disallow 
an event. 
"With the statement as it reads now, if the band wanted to put together a halftime show promoting lesbian seduction, the only thing the University could do is run a tagline on the TV that they do not endorse it," Keating said . 
lie later added, "This is four pages of' pedantic statements that will be relegated to the dustbin along with the rest of the statements like this that come out of Faculty Senate." 
Many members contested the validity of Keating's hypo­thetical case, and Brown said that reading of the document was "not a !'air interpreta­tion." 
"The intent [of the docu­ment] is to say that if you have a responsible academic event that is Idenied I and objected to only because of content, then that's pretty serious," Brown said. "We have no power over the !University! President, wha.~ we're saying here isn't law. 
Professor of music Peter Smith agreed. 
"Of course the lUniversityJ President is going to do what the President is going to do, but there is something to be said for making a statement," Smith said. 
Associate Dean of the Law School John Robinson offered an amendment he "did not necessarily sponsor or endorse" but thought would help bring the group into agreement, he said. 
The amendment, which was approved by all members except for Bederman, reads, "Note that this discussion properly centers on how to present a conference, or speech, or play, or work of art in such a way as to avoid the appearanr:e of official endorsement; it would not ordinarily center on whether an event should take place. This is not to say that extreme scenarios cannot be imagined that might appear to call for stronger presidential action that that sketched here. Our point is that such stronger action would in every case put at risk the academic freedom 
upon which the University insists in its mission state­ment." 
The group moved into a 11nal vote soon after this amend­ment was passed. The state­ment was solidly approved, with only one member -pro­fessor of German language and literature Vera Profit ­dissenting.

IN BRIEF 
Stocks rise on Bristol-Myers settlement 
NEW YORK -Stocks rose Wednesday on upbeat news from big companies: a patent settlement by Bristol-Myers Squibb, strong earnings from Morgan Stanley and a cost-cut­ting deal between General Motors Corp., Delphi Corp. and the United Auto Workers. The gains were enough to push the Dow Jones industrial average to a new five-year high. 
With scant economic data available, the market was driven by news from large-cap stocks. Bristol-Myers jumped 11 percent after the drug maker and its partner, Sanofi­Aventis SA, announced an agreement to settle a patent challenge. Investors were also cheered after Morgan Stanley's quarterly profit rose 17 percent. 
Transportation stocks rose after General Motors and parts maker Delphi announced a deal with the UAW that would help the strug­gling companies cut costs by offering buyouts to 113,000 U.S. hourly workers. 
Ex Enron exec testifies against ex CEO 
HOUSTON -Enron Corp. founder Kenneth Lay worried in 2001 that the company's mounting financial problems would jeopardize its credit rating and inquired about managing its accounting to avoid a downgrade, a former Enron treasurer testified Wednesday. 
Testimony by former Treasurer Ben Glisan Jr., which began late Tuesday and has outlined a series of what he said were public fabrica­tions by Lay and former Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Skilling about the health of the compa­ny, struck a nerve with Lay. 
During a break in Glisan's testimony Wednesday afternoon, a visibly annoyed Lay told reporters, "I've never heard so many lies in one day in my whole life." Lay's wife, Linda, nodded her head and added, "Unbelievable." 
Glisan testified that Lay assigned him to feel out credit-rating agencies about how large some required accounting writedowns could be without jeopardizing Enron's rating. 
"That"s backwards," Glisan told jurors in the fraud and conspiracy trial of Lay and Skilling. "What should occur is we should take the charges that we needed to take and then deal with the consequences."

Pfizerto invest money in plant 
Drugmaker to hire more than 450 workers to manufacture inhalable insulin 
Associated Press 
TERRE HAUTE, Ind. ­Pfizer Inc., the world's largest drugmaker, plans to hire more than 450 work­ers and invest $170 million at a western Indiana plant where it manufactures the nation's first inhalable ver­sion of insulin. 
Pfizer said Wednesday it will hire the workers over the next two to three years, boosting to about 650 the number of employees at its Exubera inhaler produc­tion line. It also plans to invest $170 million at the 120,000-square-foot Terre Haute plant by 2009. 
New York-based Pfizer received federal approval in late January to market the Exubera inhaler for controlling Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes in adults. The device offers the first new way of delivering insulin since the discovery of the hormone in the 1920s. 
Some stock analysts pre­dict Exubera will be popu­lar, with annual sales top­ping $1 billion within three years. The inhaler would allow millions of adult dia­betics an alternative to some of the injections they now endure.

with the footnote that enumer­
ates what we want to say is a 
fuzzy set oflogic," Tortorello said. 
But Zahm senator Pat Knapp 
defended the Committee's resolu­
tion -and said the University 
subscribes to AAUP guidelines 
when setting policy. 
"[The AAUP] is an oversight 
organization that largely oversees many policies relating to issues pertinent to academic freedom and what professors can and can't do," Knapp said. "The policy bearings they publish ... have sig­nificant bearing and weight that Notre Dame and other institu­tions adopt. To not mention this · would leave out a significant influencing factor on Notre Dame 
policy." 
Siegfried senator Ben Gunty 
said the incorporation of AAUP 
policy in the resolution was justi­
fied. 
"If we are a member of the 
organization that upholds the pol­
icy then the logic is clear ... we 
follow AAUP policy too," Gunty 
said. "We subscribe to a subordi­
nate group that the AAUP over­
sees. I think the logic is clear." 
Farley senator Carol 
Hendrickson said the use of the 
word "disallow" in the resolution 
could open a "loophole" since it 
fails to mention events that would 
be restricted every other year, for 
example. 
"We can sit here and talk about 
language all day ... not everyone 
is going to be happy with the 
exact language ... we're not try­
ing to be very specific," Walsh 
said. "We're trying to be broad 
and proactive instead of reactive. 
We're not trying to be reactive to 
certain even~s that already hap­
pened." 
Echoing concerns voiced by 
senators at last week's meeting, Carroll senator Jim Grace reminded senators that the reso­lution is not guaranteed to influ­ence Jenkins' final policy. 
"What do we do if it gets ignored by the administration? ... This body doesn't set policy for University and hopefully they'll heed or input ... in the end I think it's important that it doesn't look like Student Senate is powerless if they don't listen to us," Grace said. 
The resolution was passed with three senators opposed and one senator abstaining. 
Members also passed a resolu­tion to add a permanent commit­tee to the Senate charged with focusing on community relations. 
The resolution includes chang­ing the constitution to include the responsibilities of the now-per­manent Committee on Community Relations, which will "address the relations between the student body and the resi­dents of the South Bend area as it works to build a lasting relation­ship between the two groups." 
Members approved a resolution put forth by judicial council presi­dent James Leito that makes changes to the election section of the Student Union Constitution. 
"Basically the main thing is if you did approve this, there would be no changes in the way elec­tions are run," Leito said before senators voted on his resolution. "It's not any procedural changes, it's mostly cosmetic." 
Leito's resolution clarifies pro­cedures that are already in prac­tice regarding student govern­ment elections, he said. 
Among other additions, the res­olution gives the Judicial Council the right to specify dates for hall elections "pending the approval of the Hall President's Council." 
Members defeated a resolution calling for an amendment to the Senate Section of the Constitution. Dillon senator Dan Bowen presented the resolution, which called for senators repre­senting higher population dorms to have more voting power than those from smaller dorms. 
Bowen said his resolution helped to eliminate the "tyranny of the minority." 
"My resolution brings a more democratiC balance to the fold," Bowen said. "There is a hypothet­ical situation when it's possible for two-thirds of the Senate to vote or vote against something and it barely represents half of the student population." 
Knapp sharply shot down Bowen's resolution. 
"Did you read the discussion when this constitution was being drafted? ... Our first and fore­most purpose was to be a union, not a representative democracy ... we are a union." 
In other Senate news 
+ Travis Arnold from the Office of the Indiana Secretary of State spoke to senators about the effect in Indiana of 2002's Help America Vote Act, which he said has helped usher in "a new era in the technology of voting." 
He encouraged members to tell their constituents who are from the state of Indiana about some of the new regulations associated with the new legislation. For example, Arnold said, a student identific:;ation card from a private university like Notre Dame is not a valid form of identification for voting. However, 10 cards from public universities are accepted.

There comes a time in every pundit's life when he seeks to rise above ephemeral opinion-mongering and make a permanent contribution to political thought. I have decided that the time has come to unveil mine, which I call, without even the pre­tense of modesty, Wicks' Law. Here it is: (Since print technology has not yet reached the point at which it is possible to embed sound effects in text, please provide your own fanfare before proceeding to the next paragraph.) 
Wicks' Law: Whatever you believe, some damn liJol will agree with you. 
Okay, so perhaps that isn't exactly an Earth-shattering insight, but Wicks' Law does have an important corollary, which is that you cannot refute a person's belief just by showing that someone else who holds the same belief is a damn f(JOl. That too may seem elementary, but it's a point that is nonetheless frequently ignored. 
For example, I believed (and continue to bPiieve) that the United States was right to use military Ioree to depose Saddam llussein. Whnn I tell this to people who take the contrary view I have often found that they often respond -not always, but fre­quently -by denouncing some argument made by someone else in favor of the war. It is as if I am expected not only to argue for my own position, but defend any other argument that has been used to argue for that position. The belief that the United States was right in its decision to usc mili­tary intervention in Iraq is something I have in conunon with Ann Coulter, but the mere fact that we agree on that point doesn't mean we have entered into any sort of political coalition and it certainly doesn't conunit me to defending either the style or the content of Coulter's arguments. 
There was a morally serious, knowledge­able and politically pragmatic case against the war. I heard it made by friends, col-

Small talk for dummies 
How are you? Fine. Never have two more banal phrases been uttered. And yet, these sentences are spoken thousands of times every day. I'm ashamed to admit that I've been a participant in this mundane exchange. I'm an avowed hater of small talk, but I don't know how to end it. Answering the question honestly might put people off because no one really cares 
Jessica

how I'm actually doing. I just don't have the 
Tedder

nerve to do it. The stunned reactions when people can't figure out how to respond to ''I'm 
University of
awful. 1have a headache, I'm hungry, I'm 
Texas­

weeks behind on homework and I wish you 
Arlington

weren't talking to me," are too hard to take. 
The Shorthorn 
And yet, this simple exchange and small talk in general are important to society. We need a way to start a dialogue with each other. People must com­municate for life as we know it to continue, because the hermit lifestyle just won't allow for much progress. So, how do we learn to communicate without sounding trite? 
For women, the answer used to be simple. There was finishing school where they would learn poise, deportment, cookery, eti­quette and all other skills necessary to be a lady in society. 
While this is sort ofStepford-esque, it may have made life easier leagues, and professional political conunen­tators. The· fact that the war was also opposed by the likes ofMichael Moore (whose views on the matter I would be inclined to dismiss as a paranoid fantasy were it not for the fact that they lack the internal coherence characteri<>tic of a para­noiac's delusions) does nothing to under­mine their position. 
When confronted with a difficult and con­
tentious issue it is always tempting to per­
suade ourselves that it is not a diflieult and 
contentious issue at all. One way of doing 
that is by only paying attention to tl10se on 
the other side with obviously flawed argu­
ments (and ideally with clear ulterior 
motives and glaring moral defects too). A 
second way, every bit as popular, is by 
clouding what's at stake with euphemistic 
and evasive rhetoric. 
Last semester an initiative was proposed in the Faculty Senate to increase U10 "cul­tural competency" of' Notre Dame's student body, possibly by means of a dass mquire­ment. When challenged as to the vagueness of the term, Hhca Boyd, chair of the Minority Affairs Committee, replied that a cultural competence committee should be formed and it would be their job to determine what the meaning of"eultural" should be. The creation of that committee was approved earlier this semester, so I guess that the first item on the committee's order of business is deciding for themselves what it is that' they are supposed to be doing. 
Overall, Boyd's stated position seemed to be that neither she nor anyone else involved in proposing the initiative knows what cultural competence is, they just know that it's very important and we need more of it. 
There is another possibility, however. I suspect that they do know what cultural competence is, but don't want to explain it in terms that have a chance of being under-
on women. Having honed the proper skills, they had no need to 
feel awkward. 

Knowing which fork to use for which course and how to fold a napkin into a swan aren't skills in high demand these days. Neither is walking with a book on your head. But being a polite person who can conununicate in any situation would be a won­derful ability. Today's modern woman lacks the ideal opportunity to address polite social behaviors. If we don't pick up social graces from our parents, we're certainly not going to grasp them in school. And, with gender equality and hands-off parenting, some of us wind up behaving more like boys than ladies. 
I'm not advocating a return to the 1950s, but I am suggesting that we find a better way to converse. Maybe support groups for the conversationally challenged are in order. We could get togeth­er and practice asking "How are you?" and listen to each response with sincerity.

stood because they realize that to do so would be to risk saying some condescend­ing and inflammatory things about Notre Dame's students. Sticking to abstract terms sterilized of meaning is an altogether safer way to go. Personally, I don't believe that cultural competency can be taught in a classroom, but those wi<>hing to learn how to successfully navigate within the culture of a large and bureaucratic organization such as a university could learn a lot from studying the rhetorical strategies of the cul­tural competence committee. 
This is just one ofa thousand possible examples of a general temptation. The flight to lofty abstractions makes it easier to blind ourselves to the tragic nature of poli­tics and engage in what the Czech noveli<>t Milan Kundera called "political kitsch." It makes it harder to recobmizn legitimate grounds for disagreement ("Are you saying you're against diversity and raising a warn­ness?"). 
Almost fifty years ago, Isaiah Bnrlin wrote "Everything is what it is: liberty is liberty, not equality or fairness or justice or eulturn, 
or human happiness or a quiet con­scienen." I lis point was that pol­itics is about dillicult choices betwmm dill'crent and sometimes competing 
goods. II', lhr example, you are !'aced with a trade-oil' betwPen priva­cy and national security we must avoid the temptation to obfuscate 
by saying that privacy and national security are really one and the same thing. On the other hand, we live in a culture where obfusca­tion is a valuable skill. Perhaps we should teach it. Perhaps we already are.

Allow God to bring the image of Jesus to you 
Now that we have returned from a restful spring break and a chance to be with family and friends, it is important for us to {re)turn our minds to the Lenten season. Lenten resolutions are not like New Year's resolutions, which we Richard V. may or may not take Warner, CSC seriously and quickly set aside. It is easier FaithPoint for all of us to be mindful of Lent when we are on Campus, and our life takes on a certain predictable rhythm. That is one of the reasons I halfway in jest refer the first Sunday back after break as "Ash Sunday," even if there is no distribution of ashes. 
In my favorite preface for the Mass, that of Lent one, both a beautiful description of Lent and the role it plays in our lives are beautifully expressed: "You give us this joyful season when we prepare to celebrate the pascal mys­tery with mind and heart renewed." And it goes on to make this powerful statement and promise: "As we recall the great events that gave us new life in Christ, you bring the image of your son to perfection within us." 
The reason for our lives as Christians is to know and love God and to love and serve our neighbor. The Gospel is filled with examples from the life of Christ as to how we can do this. 
Our love for God grows stronger and becomes real when we spend time with God in prayer, whether at Mass, at the Grotto, by praying the rosary, by read­ing the Mass texts for the day or the Bible, through a few moments before the Blessed Sacrament, by a reflective walk around the lake, through a con­versation with a friend, by spiritual reading or in many other avenues which are ava11able to us. All of these ways have been used by generations of faithful believers who have gone before us and who have become holy men and women as their love for God deepened and became a more central part of their day and of their lives. To deepen our love for God, we increase the amount of time we spend in prayer to the extent that we can and in ways that we find helpful. 
We love and serve our neighbor through sharing of time with those in need through service and by sharing our material possessions with the poor. Jesus never turned his back on anyone who was poor or came to him in need. During Lent, we try to be more aware of others so that we can be friends to · the poor even as Jesus was. By making additional small sacrifices -the things we "give up for Lent" -we share our resources with those neighbors of ours who are most in need of our help. 
But there is an additional challenge during Lent. As we try to increase our love for God, it is important for us to become as aware as we can of God's love for us. This love is deeply person­al, it is present to us in all the circum­stances of our lives no matter where our lives lead us or what joys, sorrows and challenges we have to face. When we achieve even a little insight into God's love for us we experience the deep peace that only a person who is redeemed and forgiven can feel. 
It is much easier to speak of God's love for us than it is to really believe it. We are constantly surrounded by the air we breathe and rarely advert to it. In much the same way, we are always surrounded by God's intense love for us whether we think about it or not. To paraphrase the Scriptures, God sees and loves in us what God sees and loves in His own Jesus. 
And so as we continue our Lenten journeys during this season of grace, let us be grateful for this image of Jesus which is being brought about within us.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Leave our mascot alone 



'Fighting' Irish 
not a racist moniker 
This letter is in response to Paul Richards' letter to the editor in the March 22 edition of The Observer about Notre Dame's mascot. 
It is my opinion that an indi­vidual who writes in against Notre Dame using the moniker '!Fighting Irish" misses the sig­nificance of our mascot. Further, he leaves out an important aspect of the NCAA's position regarding mascots that could be per­ceived as damaging or perpet­uating stereotypes about racial, ethnic or cultural groups. 
First and foremost, I find Notre Dame's mascot to be a celebration of the resiliency and strength of the Irish peo­ple. As the writer indicated, the Irish have suffered through numerous hardships in their history -occupation by a foreign power, religious discrimination, famine and overt racism here in the United States have all been faced by the Irish people, and yet they persevered to become one of the most influential peoples in history. 
I would ask the writer if he feels that Dan Breen or Michael Collins, fighters for Irish independence in the beginning of the twentieth century, would object to the attachment of "Fighting" to Irish. Would Father Corby, C.S.C., who was the chaplain of the famed Irish Brigade during the Civil War and has been immortalized in the famous "Absolution at Gettysburg" statue object? Would the men in the United States army he led into battle and for whom he was a spiri­tualleader object? Finally, would the thousands of Irish men and women {including my ancestor Patrick Hannon) who struggled against poverty and discrimination in the cities and towns of America to make a better life for their family object? My answer to the above questions is a resound­ing no. The history of the Irish people is one of a constant fight-a fight against occupa­tion, a fight for equal rights, a fight for respect. It is a fight that the country of Ireland and the Irish people have won, and the majority of the Irish see in Notre Dame an institution that respects and celebrates their vaunted tradition. 
To a much lesser extent, it is important to remember that the NCAA, in investigating suspect mascots, takes into consideration the feelings of the affected groups. It is for this reason that Florida State is still allowed to use the "Seminole" as a mascot-the Seminole Tribe of Florida gave its support to the school. The writer of the Letter to the Editor makes it sound as though the overwhelming majority of Irish citizens are up in arms against our school's mascot. If this is true, someone had better tell President Mary McAleese, quick! Though one wonders why the President of Ireland would support a school with such a racist mascot... Unless of course it is because the mascot is not, in fact, racist. 
Kendall Hannon senwr Keenan Hall March 22 

Proud to be a fighter' 
No doubt, there will be many alumni, stu­dents and Irish fans who will be up in arms over Paul L. Richards' letter to the editor on March 22. In that letter, Mr. Richards "serves notice" to both the NCAA and the Notre Dame community about his offense at the term "Fighting Irish." Mr. Richards, who is neither an alumnus nor a student, should be forgiven for his obvious ignorance of the University of Notre Dame and its history. 
In the face of rising bigotry and intoler­ance in the late 19th and early 20th cen­turies, the University of Notre Dame (while not founded by the Irish) served as a haven for Irish and Catholics alike. Anyone who came to this university could rest assured in the fact that they would not be judged, grad­ed or discriminated against based on his race, religion or culture. This was a policy at the University even at a time when member­ship in the Ku Klux Klan was on the rise in nearby towns and communities. 
This stance did not come without a cost. Notre Dame students (and not just its Irish students) often got into physical altercations and conflicts with Klan members dl}ring the early 1900s to 1920s. Notre Dame students· made sure not only to protect its own, but also to take a stand against intolerance and bigotry. We literally were the "Fighting Irish." While times have changed, the spirit remains. It is for that reason that many ­including myself {full disclosure-I am nei­ther Irish, nor Catholic, nor even American) -take pride in being a part of The Fighting Irish.

CD REVIEWS 
Unique sound improves with every listen 
By MOLLY GRIFFIN AssiSiant Scene Ed110r 
Nanwd allPr a rhildren's book char­acter and t:rnating its own dreamy, mPandnring music, Trespassnrs William is a uniqun forcn in the musie world today. Tlw band's third album "!laving" r~vnals tlw complnx blend or gnnrns and atmosplwric sound that makes up tlw tlwir distinetive sound. 
Trnspassnrs William Is made up of Boss Simonini (bass and knyboards), Anna-Lynrw Williams (vocals and gui­tar). Matt Brown (guitar and key­boards) and .Jamin Williams (drums). Tlw band startml as a twosomn in I997 in Los Angnlns with Anna-Lynne Williams and Brown, and the band rnleased its lirst album two years later artnr adding Simonini to tho lineup. 
"!laving" is tlw third full album released by Trespass(~rs William. Their rirst album was 1999's "Anchor," which was followed up by the U.K. rdnaso or 2002's "Different Stars." 
Having 
Trespassers William 



Their second album was re-rclcased in 2004 in North America, and this estab­lishnd the band as a new power in music. 
While the ambient, folk-tinged music madn by Trespassers William may not be immediately recognizable to many listeners, it has been featured in nurnNous ntms and television shows. Programs like "Tho O.C.," "One Tree Hill" and "Huffy the Vampire Slayer" have all used the band's atmospherie music, as have lilms like "A Love Song for Bobby Long" and "Annapolis." 
The band's unique name actually comes from a Winnie the Pooh story called "Pooh and Piglet Go Hunting and Nearly Catch a Woozle." The story revnals that Trespassers William is the name of Piglet's grandfather. 
Trespassers William's sound has ele­ments of groups like Mazzy Star and singp.rs like Aimee Mann, but they forge their own unique space in the pop landscape. Unlike many albums today that have one identifiable single -and usually little to offer beyond that -"Having" emerges as an album that almost requires being listened to as a whole. Individual songs on the record, while strong, lose something when not part of 
the album  as  a  
whole.  
"Having" is  a  



impress on lirst listen, but only grows better with each press of the play but­ton. The meandering quality of the music, along with its hybrid or pop, electronic and folk, separates it from most pop music today. Most of the songs on the album start out slowly and simply, but gradually swell into deeply engrossing songs. 
The most impressive part of "llaving" is the ability of each song to stand on its own while still managing to create an album that sounds like a unified whole. The gorgeous "Safe, Sound" opens the album, and its slow build and distortion of Williams' voice cre­ates an interesting effect. The album moves on to the beautiful "What of Me," 
The only somewhat weak songs on "Having" are "Weakening" and "No One," and their weakness lies in the 
somewhat static sound each song maintains. While these songs aren't necessarily bad, they lack the growing and evolving quality that the better songs on the record exhibit. The album's best songs, which exemplify this constantly growing sound, include the opening "Safe, Sound," as well as "I Don't Mind," "Ledge," "We Lean In" and "What of Me." 
Overall, "llaving" is not an immedi­ately gripping album but it, like many of the songs on the album, grows and evolves the more that it is listened to. It's blend of genre, the strong song­writing the band exhibits and its unique sound makes it a unique break from the bulk of bands in the music world today.

Black breaths new life into acoustic community 
By BOB COSTA 
St·enc Critic 
Forget for a moment that there is a plethora of sing(~r-songwriters on tlw eurrent tnusie scene. From James Blunt to .John Mayor and Mkhael Tolcher, there seom to be more than nnough sensitive guys strumming six-strings to go around. But aniidst the pop sensibilities of the afornrnontioned solo artists who occupy t.lw uppnr-edwlon of the pop-rock eharts lacks an artist playing unadorned, and perhaps 1won melancholy, folk-rock. Gus Bla1~k could he the artist who fills that void. 
Black's now record. "Autumn Days," which was rnloasnd on Tuesday on Cheap Lullaby Hoeords is a haunting ·and inti­mat!' album for those who enjoy both U2 and Dashboard Confessional. 
"Autumn Days" is part fractured acoustic opulence and part dubious poignancy. Heeorded as a catharsis for thn artist, the album plays as a cohesive collection of songs that wo·utd be com­fortable on an episode of "The O.C.," or in a dim South Bend basement strewn about with old Elliot Smith and Gary .Jules records. Each track is tinged with a deep, but subtle, sense of sadness. Black plucks his guitar with a profound deft­ness, evoking melancholy at every turn. 
But it's not a negative or depressing record. Bather, the album begins with a sense of emptiness and wanting on "Don't Go Tollin' Tho Whole World" and by it's conclusion on the album's hidden song (a pleasant surprise) the listener feels refreshed. 
(;us Black has recorded a true album here -something that wouldn't sound as good on an i-tunes play list. It has nuances between songs adjacent to each other that are only appreciated on a sec­ond listen. The segue between "Fire Escape" and "So Very Young" is a perfect transition between blatant arena rock and a mellow acoustic melody. "Fire

while alone late one night after a club gig in Europe wishing to be home. 
The outlier among the fifteen tracks is the album's lirst single "Certain Kind of Light" which is reminiscent of Black's rock roots. It hurtles forward with a catchy rifT. An obvious lyrical letter to a past lover, tho song is a welcome jolt of musical call'eine on an album that mur­murs and sways at many intervals. 
"Autumn Days" features performances by longtime Black band members Hocco Bidlovski and Gianni Neiviller, as well as Dave Palmer (Fiona Apple) and Sarah Watkins of Nickel Creek. The majority of the folksy acoustic songs clock in at less than three minutes. 
On "Long Beach (It's a Miracle)," Black holds back chords then plunges frantical­ly down the fret board as if he's drifting in and out of consciousness. The inclu­sion of a strong rhythm section on the album's strongest track "Traffic and Sound" gives the song a Coldplay-like grandeur, soaring from a simple folk song into an epic that Bono probably wishes he wrote. 

Black's cover of "Don't Fear the Reaper" was on the soundtrack for the original Scream movie. llis songs have been featured in television shows, includ­ing Alias, Smallville and One Tree I Jill. lie played at the South by Southwest Music Festival and spent most of 2005 in Europe playing gigs around Germany and in the Netherlands.

DPAC REVIEW 
Pomerium creates memorable a capella experience 
By SEAN SWEANY Scene Critic 
The Leighton Concert Hall at ·the DeBartolo Center for the Performing Arts (DPAC) was transformed into a European cathedral thanks to the a capella group Pome ri u m Tuesday night. 
The New York based group, which takes its name from the Medieval Latin word for "garden," has been perform­ing music composed for Renaissance chapel choirs since 1972. Pomerium founder and director Alexander Blachly is a music professor at Notre Dame who also directs the University of Notre Dame Chorale and Chamber Orchestra. 
The highly acclaimed group performs mostly in New York, but has toured numerous international festivals and recorded several albums. In Pomerium, Blachly has assembled an impressive array of the best vocal talent in the country. Comprised of sopranos, a mezzo-soprano, tenors, countertenor and basses, Pomerium can sing a wide variety of songs and has the ability to fill any space with rich, full sound that f1oats through the air with an almost magical quality. 
Pomerium began the concert Tuesday night with works from the early Renaissance, a time when Botticelli and Leonardo da Vinci were inf1uenc­ing art and science. The first song was also the best of the night, a beautiful "Ave Maria" sung in Latin. The energy and emotion captured in the "Ave" set the stage for the melodious evening that was to follow. 
After several songs featuring only some-of the fourteen member group, all of Pomerium reunited to perform a live part Mass composed by Johannes Ockeghem. Ockeghem was a Belgian composer who is regarded as one of the most important composers of the 15th century. The Mass, entitled "Mass on L'homme arme" combines parts of a Latin Mass with a French song whose name translates to "The man at arms is here." This unique combination was harmonic and displayed the full vocal range of Pomerium. 
Immediately following the sung Mass was a sorrowful and haunting song written on the death of the composer Ockeghem. Written by Ockeghem's pupil, this song served as a plaintive memorial to the passing of the great composer. Pomerium succeeded in expressing the sorrow of the song to their audience through a language barrier. 
The second set of the night explored music from the late Renaissance, when expression of emotion came to the forefront of musical composition. These songs had a concert-like feel, and were richer and fuller than the first set. 
First, the group sang a set of madri­gals, songs usually reserved for two or three voices. The effect of all 14 singers contributing caused the songs to reso~nd throughout the concert hall. After the madrigals came a series of six motets, which are a capella songs adapted from sacred texts. In the spirit of the Easter season, many of the madrigals and motets involved the events surrounding the upcoming death and resurrection of Jesus. 

Just like the Easter season, these songs were somber, yet laced with a sense of hope. Pomerium accomplished this by having separate members of the group singing different melodies at the same time. This harmonic interplay created a busy aural spectrum that forced the audience to listen closely for the different layers in each song. 

CD REVIEW 
Unlikely duo produces diverse range of tnusical intrigue 
By MOLLY GRIFFIN Assistant Scene Editor 
Hearing that a band is an organ and drums combo might put most listeners off. but Mates of State manage to take what could be a potentially disastrous musical equation and turn it into extremely catchy music. The group's latest effort, "Bring It Back," reveals the depth and diverse range of music that springs from this unlikely duo. 
Mates of State is the husband and wife team of Kori Gardner (organ. singer) and Jason Hammel (drums, singer). While the band started in the Midwest, they eventually moved to San Francisco, Calif.. and started playing various venues on the west coast. The band officially started in 2001 when the band members quit their day jobs ­a teacher and a cancer researcher respectively -got married, and began touring more heavily. 
"Bring It Back" is Mates of State's fourth full album, following 2003's "My Solo Project," 2002's "Our Constant Concern" and 2003's "Team Boo." 
The band's label, Barsuk Records, is the home of indie rock heavy-weights Rilo Kiley, Death Cab for Cutie and Nada Surf. The band has toured ven­ues ranging from small clubs to larger festivals like Coachella, and they have toured the United States, Europe and Japan. 
Mates of State sound is difficult to qualify. While they are a two-instru­ment duo, the band manages to vary the sound of their music significantly. Their vocal harmonies are compli­mented by the drums and the organ, and their music has a generally upbeat feeling. 
"Bring It Back" is an undeniably catchy album, but unlike many appeal­ing albums, it becomes more intriguing rather than tiresome with multiple lis­tenings. The aloum opens with "Thing Long," which is actually duller and more repetitive than most of the songs on the album, but the songs get better from there. "Fraud in the '80s" blends 
synthesizer 
sounds with beautiful har­monies, which provides an interesting coun­terpoint to the piano-driven "Like U Crazy." 
"Beautiful Dreamer" and "For the Actor" exemplify the upbeat nature of the music made by Mates of State, while "What it Means" 

At the end of the program, the images of European cathedrals began to leave the minds of the audience, but the sound of Pomerium seemed to hang in the air. The Renaissance music proved to be as fresh and enjoyable now as when it was written 500 years ago. The talented a capella group used this music to serenade the audience and create a truly memorable experience. 
Contact Sean Sweany at ssweany@nd.edu 

and "Nature and the Wreck" provide a slightly more solemn side to the record as a whole. 
While the rest of the album is great, Mates of State really leave the best songs on the album for last. The swell of music and voices, coupled with great lyrics, makes "So Many Ways" one of the album's strongest tracks. "So Many Ways" is followed by "Punchlines," which deftly changes between different melodies and harmonies and builds power that leads to the final track on the album. · 
"Running Out," the final song on "Bring It Back," is by far the album's strongest piece. The song is longer at nearly seven minutes long, but it exemplifies the sound Mates of State has created. It starts out slowly with a single voice and gradually builds over the length of the track to showcase the harmonies and musical abilities of the band. It is a track that begs for repeat­ed listens, and it manages to be both catchy and complicated simultaneous­ly. 
"Bring It Back" emerges as an upbeat album with a host of undeni­ably appealing songs, and it may just change the way music lovers think about drum and organ duos in the music world.

Associated Press 
JUPITER, Fla. -Alfonso Soriano's only chance in left field Wednesday was a reminder of the good old days, before the Washington Nationals finally persuaded him to change positions. 
Soriano jogged in a few steps to catch a routine fly ball by Albert Pujols, then threw to second base to double off David Eckstein. 
"I never think I'm going to make a double play in the outfield," Soriano said. "But I did it." 
Soriano agreed to make the move from second base only two days after refus­ing to take his new spot in the outfield. The Nationals had a day off Tuesday, giv­ing him time to accept the switch. 

"It's a relief for every­body, it really is," manager Frank Robinson said before the game. "We get the distractions away from here and we can focus on baseball now and getting this ballclub tuned up and ready to go for opening day." 
Now, all Soriano needs is his own glove. He bor­rowed prospect George Lombard's outfield model Wednesday during a 9-3 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals. 
There wasn't much sus­pense earlier in the day. 
Robinson had Soriano bat­ting leadoff in left field on his lineup card several hours before game time, arid the player was all smiles during batting prac­tice. He even signed sever­al autographs. 
Soriano was an AL All­Star the last four years at second base, and played there this spring for the Dominican Republic in the World Baseball Classic. He has never played the out­field in a major league game, and said the last time he played there in spring training was in 2001. 
The Nationals got Soriano in a December trade with Texas for out­
fielders Brad Wilkerson and Terrmel Sledge and minor league pitcher Armando Galarraga, and general manager Jim Bowden and Robinson have been trying to per­suade Soriano to switch positions since. Washington already has an established second base­man, three-time All-Star Jose Vidro. 
Robinson considers the position move permanent, saying he doesn't even view Soriano as the back­up at second base. 
"We're doing it for the season," Robinson said. "We didn't ask him to do it for today, that's not the answer we wanted." 
IN BRIEF 
Alford has no plans for job
interviews 
IOWA CITY, Iowa -Iowa basket­ball coach Steve Alford said Wednesday he loves the Hawkeyes and has no immediate plans to inter­view for other coaching jobs. 
Earlier this month, Alford was linked in media reports to the tpp job at Indiana, where he was an All­American and led the Hoosiers to the national title in 1987.. Mike Davis announced last month that he would resign at the end of the season, and the job opened after the Hoosiers were eliminated from the NCAA tour­nament Saturday. 
''I'm the head coach at Iowa," Alford said in a statement. ''I'm flat­tered with the interest and the recog­nition of the outstanding season we had this year. With that success, comes attention and speculation I cannot control. I have not scheduled any interviews with any other institu­tions." 

NFL to reevaluate penalty
rules at league meetmgs 
NEW YORK -The NFL is satisfied with its officiating but concerned that high-profile errors in the play­offs and Super Bowl left a bad impression. 
So beginning next week at league meetings in Orlando, Fla., it will tweak a few rules, dealing mostly with player safety, offensive holding and false starts. 
"Because of the magnitude of the games, there's an indictment of the system," Atlanta general manager Rich McKay, co-chairman of the league's competition committee, said Wednesgay during a conference call. The committee also includes Indianapolis Colts president Bill Polian. 
The main topic will be the first steps in choosing a successor to Paul Tagliabue. The commissioner will appoint a committee Monday to begin the process. 
Instant replay makes debut 
on WTA tour 
KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. -Jamea Jackson watched her groundstroke land close to the sideline, and when it was called out, she sensed a chance to make a little history. 
So she requested a video replay review -the first on the profes­sional tennis tours -even though she thought the ruling was correct. 
"I just wanted to be first," Jackson said with a laugh. "That's what it really was all about." 
Instant replay made its tour debut Wednesday at the Nasdaq-100 Open, and initial reviews were favorable. It was used only on the stadium court, which gave Jackson and opponent Ashley Harkleroad the first shot at video replays of their shots. 
In a three-hour match won by Jackson, she and Harkleroad chal­lenged two calls each, and only one ruling was reversed.

Germans beat US

4-1 in exhibition 
American team plays witlwut halfofstarters 
Associated Press 
DORTMUND, Germany ­When German players left the field at halftime, their game against the United States score­less, fans booed and whistled. 
Then Germany scored 21 seconds into the second half and romped to a 4-1 victory that relieved some of the pres­sure on the World Cup hosts, and did little to inspire confi­dence in the U.S. team. 
"What this game proves is who can play at this level and who can't," U.S. goalkeeper Kasey Keller said. 
The Americans were missing about half their projected World Cup starting lineup because of injuries and club commitments, and they dropped to 0-9 in Europe against the major soccer pow­ers of Germany, England, Italy, France and Spain. They've been outscored 26-4 in those games. 
For the United States, which allowed four goals for the first time since a 4-2 loss at Germany four years ago, it was the last warmup against a World Cup qualifier before their tournament opener June 12 against the Czech Republic. The Americans' remaining exhibition games are at home against Jamaica, Morocco, Venezuela and Lativa. 
"I don't think too many play­ers played themselves onto our World Cup roster tonight, to be honest with you," coach Bruce Arena said. 
company met "three or four times" with Michael Rains, an attorney for Bonds. 
"There wasn't any payment involved, there weren't any threats, there wasn't any quid pro quo, but he made it very clear that Barry would appreci­ate it if we kept him out of it. And we had several discussions about how Mike Rains knew what the score was -and that is that he knew Barry was using," Ellerman said in the book. 
"Shadows" also claims that BALCO founder Victor Conte encouraged clients to keep quiet and claim they were taking flaxseed oil if asked by authori­ties about their use of a design­er steroid known as "the clear," among the designer steroids distributed by BALCO that were said to be undetectable. 
Bonds reportedly told a grand jury investigating BALCO in 2003 that he never knowingly used steroids, claiming his trainer had given him what he thought was flaxseed oil and arthritis balm. Bonds didn't acknowledge reporters while getting dressed for the Giants' exhibition game against the Los Angeles Angels on Wednesday night. 
The book claims BALCO's per­formance-enhancing drugs were used by several other ath­letes, including track stars Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery; NFL players including Bill Romanowski; and Sheffield. 
The authors say Bonds' train­er, Greg Anderson, put Sheffield on injectable testosterone and a human growth hormone in 2002, and also sold him the "cream" and the "clear." Sheffield has admitted that he used a cream two years ago but said he did not know that it con­tained illegal steroids. 
According to the book, Sheffield -who started train­ing with Bonds following the 2001 season -wanted to keep getting designer steroids from Anderson, even after the two sluggers had a falling out. 
On Wednesday in Tampa, Sheffield denied using the drugs mentioned in the book. 
"What can I do? I'm not going to defend myself my whole life," he said. "It doesn't matter to me. I don't have anything to say. No need to. It is what it is." 
Giambi, the 2000 American League MVP when he played with Oakland, developed a rela­tionship with Anderson during a baseball exhibition trip to Japan in 2002, by which time he had signed with the Yankees, according to the book. 
The book said Giambi wanted to learn "what was Anderson doing to keep Bonds playing at so high a level. Could Anderson help Giambi, too?" 
It said Giambi wanted to suc­ceed at baseball in part because of a perfectionist father who loved the sport. 
"I have nothing to say. I haven't seen it," Giambi said at New York Yankees camp in Tampa, Fla. 
The book alleges that Giambi later flew to Bay Area and met Anderson at a gym, and that the pair went to the hospital to have Giambi's blood drawn and take a blood and urine sample to BALCO. 
The book said Giambi tested positive for Deca-Durabolin, and that Anderson advised the slugger he would fail baseball's new drug test, which was start­ing in the upcoming season.

SAN FRANCISCO -Barry Bonds tried to keep his name out of the BALCO scandal, send­ing his lawyer into meetings with company representatives to ask for protection, according to a new book. 
"Game of Shadows" also details how Jason Giambi turned to performance-enhanc­ing drugs because the Yankee first baseman felt pressured to please his perfectionist father, and made contact with Bonds' trainer to inquire what he was doing "to keep Bonds playing at so high a level." 
And Gary Sheffield, Giambi's Yankee teammate who admitted he took steroids but did so unknowingly, had developed a relationship with Bonds' trainer and continued to use him as a source for other performance­enhancers -such as injectable testosterone and a human 
growth hormone -the authors wrote. 
Bonds used a vast array of performance-enhancing drugs -steroids, human growth hor­mone, insulin -for at least five se-asons beginning in 1998, according to the book, written by two San Francisco Chronicle reporters. Excerpts from the book, scheduled for release Thursday, were released earlier this month. 
The book quotes Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative defense lawyer Troy Ellerman as saying Bonds tried to shield himself from the unfolding BALCO scandal. Ellerman said attorneys from the supplement

Offense leads to early success 
Team look.c; to improve with nezu head coach 
By DEIRDRE KRASULA Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's hopes to erase tho memories of' a poor 2005 campaign on tho shoulders of' its l'mshrnen and seniors, as well as a nnw head coach. 
And early in the season, the learn has sucennded. 
Tlw tmun welcomes seven nnw playnrs, whiiP also rnlurning stwm1 experienced uppnrclass­
llHHI. 
Belles first-year eoaeh Elizabeth Sullivan has worked Saint Mary's into a formidable tl~lllll. The squad lraiiwd hard in 
~-the preseason, esp11dally at tho plat11, and went 7-3 at a five-day tournament in Fort Myers, Fla. during spring brnak. "We've really worked on our hitting," Sullivan said. "We want to bn a fim:n at the plate. I want teams to worry about throwing us any pitch nnar the strike zone because we will drive whatever t.hey throw at us." Sullivan said the BPIIes will eounl on seniors i\udrny Gajor, Bridget Grall and Mnghan Marenkovie to lead the Bolles ba!'.k to thnir 2004 MIA/\ cham­pionship form. i\11 thrPt1 seniors wern present when the Belles t:apturnd their first evnr conl'er­nnen title two ynars agn. (;rail said tlw seniors took the rnsponsibility of' helping the rest of' tho squad through the coach­ing dmngn. "We took it upon ourselves to make the rest of the team adjusted Ito Sullivan!." Grall said. 

Saint Mary's outfielder Audrey Gajor catches a fly ball in a 12-4 
loss to Olivet April 26, 2005. 
Sullivan said these three know what it takes to win a tourna­ment championship and will contribute greatly to Saint Mary's suecnss this season 
The fresh man class has also contributed to the Belles' hot start. Freshman pitchers Kristin i\mram and Calli Davison threw back-to-hack no-hitters on tho fourth day of the tournament last week. 
"We have a great freshman class," Grall said. "They blend right in with the team. You really can't see a class difference any more." 
But perhaps the strongest fea­ture of the freshman class is its versatility. With three players capable of playing two different positions -Martha Smid at both eateher and outfield. Davison at pitcher and outfield and Ashley Fusaro at catcher and third-base -the Belles possess the flexibil­ity to change as Sullivan sees lit. 
Davison has thrived at the plate and on the mound, blasting a home run during her no-hitter game. 
"What's so great about this [freshman I group is the variety they bring to our team," Sullivan said.

Catholic Q&A Do Ihave to believe in the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist to be Catholic? 
The Real Presence of Jesus Christ in the Eucharist is one central beliefs of the Catholic faith and is essential to atrue and full 
understanding of the Sacrament of the Eucharist, or Holy Communion. Divine Revelation, as contained within Scripture and Tradition, has al­ways testified to the belief in Christ's real, literal, physical presence in the Eucharist. Bread and wine are no more; Body and Blood are all that ex­ist. The synoptic Gospels record Jesus' words at the Last Supper: "This is my body ...this is my blood" (Matt 26:26-28; Mark 14:22-24; Luke 
22: 19-20). For over 1500 years, all of Chtistendom believed Chtist was speaking literally here, having mystically transformed the bread and wine before Him into His very Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity, and then commanding all who followed after to do likewise "in remembrance of me" ( 1 Cor 11 :24-25). Aramaic, Jesus' native language, included over 30 different words that could have been used to mean "represents'' or "sym­bolizes." so Jesus could have easily used one of these to explain himself . if He had intended any interpretation other than the literal. However, He did not do so. 
The Gospel of John relates Jesus' view of the Eucharist in even stronger language: "...the bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world" and ''... my flesh is true food and my blood is tme drink" (John 6:51, 55). Many of His disciples, showing their shock at Jesus' claims, ceased to follow after Him (John 6:66). Had Christ intended His statements to be taken only figuratively, He could easily have clarified what He had said. The fact is, however, that He did not. Rather, risking His entire mission, He turned to The Twelve and said. ''Do you also want to leave?" (John 6:67). Peter, responding on behalf of the true disciples of the Lord, said. "Master, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life" (John 6:68). 
Paul continues to testify to this central teaching of Jesus when he makes such abig deal about people examining themselves before receiv­ing Holy Communion, acommentary that would have been unnecessary if we were only speaking of symbols: "... [W]hoever eat the bread or dtinks the cup of the Lord unworthily will have to answer for the body and blood of the Lord. Aperson should examine himself. and so eat the bread and drink the cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without dis­cerning the body, eats and drinks judgment on himself' ( 1 Cor 11 :27-30).

That Angie Maxey of Welsh Family 
Hall is being featured in this week's ''Live It'' 
will come as a surprise to no one on the Campus 
Ministry staff. It is acommon place sight in 
our office to see this sophomore Theology and 
Economics double major rapidly knocking out 
important tasks, helping the CM staff with what 
ever they need. As aCampus Ministry student 
assistant, Angie is a very present help to 


Ministry endeavors. On more than one owt­
sion, astaff member has remarked that Angie 
gets done with work more quickly than they can 
think of another task to give her. While Angie's 
great help in the CM office may not be noticed 
by those who do not regularly visit Coleman­
Morse. her faith and service are very conspicu­
ous in the many other activities she is involved 
in. Currently Angie is sharing her talents with 
the Freshman Retreat program. She is working 
with at-•roup of her sophomore and junior peers 
to plan the last Freshman Retreat of the year, 
which will take place April 7th and 8th. 
Any of Angie's friends must certainly 
be surprised that so far in this article there has 
been no mention of what is possibly Angie's 
greatest gift to the Notre Dame community: her 
wondert'ul voice~ Anyone who has attended 
a Voices of Faith Gospel Choir concert has 
received the blessing that Angie's vocal talents 
bestow upon a listener. 1f you cannot make it to 
a Voices of Faith concert, Angie regularly sings 
praise music on Thursday nights at the interde­
nominational Iron Sharpens Iron praise and fel­
lowship sessions. The Notre Dame community 
is certainly lucky that Angie chooses to share 
her God-given vocal talents. Although she is 
perpetually modest about the importance of her 
varied ministries to the Notre Dame community, 
Angie is certainly deserving of this recognition. 
Angie, for your example of faith and the minis­
try that you pursue in so many different ways. 
you and may God bless you. 
Let us know who out there 
is making adifference!

With the Irish leading 10­<J in the top of the eighth, Mainieri sent in freshman right-hander Kyle Weiland to hold the narrow lead. Weiland blew through eight Chippewa batters in two innings to secure the win and get his fifth save of the year. 
After Weiland surrendered a leadoff hit in the eighth, he struck out two and retired second baseman Noah Lankford on a fly ball to deep right field. 
Notre Dame got an insur­ance run off a Breiovsky single to right in the bottom of the eighth to put the game at 11-9. Weiland allowed a leadoff single in the ninth, but retired the next three Chippewa batters to end the game. 
"I think Kyle Weiland before he is done at Notre Dame is going to be one of the best pitchers we've seen around here in a long time," Irish . head coach Paul Mainieri said. "I just think the kid has a world of tal­ent, and he's got poise beyond his years. He's going to get nothing but better." 
Chippewa starter Ben Rodewald -the MAC West's pitcher of the week last week -lasted only one third of an inning after giv­ing up a four hit, six run Irish onslaught. 
Barnes singled up the middle with runners on first and second to score the first run and catcher Sean Gaston continued the rally with an RBI line drive single to right field. Brezovsky knocked in the third and
