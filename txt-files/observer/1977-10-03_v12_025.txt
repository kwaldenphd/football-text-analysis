'Logan cutback totally 
Unnecessary 
says Bowen 
by Peggy McGuire Staff Reporter 

Indiana Governor Otis Bowen stated late Thursday afternoon that he will recommend that the state budget committee reappropriate funds for services to the developmentally disabled. 
Bowen said that the cutback "is thoroughly unacceptable and totally unnecessary ... There is to be little doubt that the department of mental health's funding formula, which was the basis for its financial notification to Indiana's centers last Friday, is gravely inadequate." 
Aloysius Soenneker, executive director of the Council for the Retarded of St. Joseph County, said that the state budget agency met Friday to 
f discuss the governor's request. 
"I understand that surveys have been sent to the various MRDD (Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities) centers in the state," Soenneker said. "Each center is to phone in its reply by Wednesday. Friday,· the agency 
will meet to look at the results.'' 
The governor asked that the budget agency's efforts to prepare a new formula for the distribution of funds to the MRDD' "be the top priority of that staff so that local centers now financially plagued can be spared further apprehension." 
In stressing the urgency of his plea, Bowen asked the state budget committee to finalize their report before the original Oct. 15 dateline. "I would hope that we would be able to safely advise the financially troubled centers as to the proposed new spending levels before that date so they can plan to meet their program needs as quickly as possible," the governor stated. 
The gubernatorial statement also included a promise to devise a new formula for funding the 
MRDD centers. Bowen stated that "there are potentially serious flaws'' in the present method · ''flaws that if left uncorrected could result in leaving some of the centers seriously short of operating funds." The governor proposed the formation of a special committee to collect data and statistics on the MRDD centers. "Such a statutory manage­ment tool will assure the state of the timely flow of accurate statistical information from the local centers and assure the local center of the method by which the state will make its financial decisions,'' he said. Bowen also apologized for the shortcomings in the state budget committee's present allocation system. "It is deeply regrettable that our state administrators failed to devise a more solemnly 
The statement came after a series of protests against the cutback. "The governor's statement was a direct response to public pressure," South Bend Tribune reporter Nancy Sulok said. "I think that the citizen's reaction in St. Joseph County, which was stronger than anywhere else in the state, helped prompt the reply." 
The state has not yet announced the extent of the reappropriation. "It is quite certain that there will be an increase from the original
allocation,'' Soenneker stated, ''but at this point, no one knows the amount." 
"I understand that this time the agency is going to start from how much the agency requested rather than the operational costs for existing programs," the executive director continued. "Hopefully this will allow for expansion of old projects and de\ elopment of new programs.'' 
According to Soenneker, the Council for the Retarded has place their rally against the cutback "on hold". 
"The parents aren't going to go to sleep on this thing," he claimed. "The council is just giving the state time to act. If they don't restore the 
based formula--for substantially more state and funds, we're ready to fight." federal funds are available state-wide for the Soenneker is optimistic however. "The operation of those centers than were expended governor is obviously upset. I hope that he'll last year," he claimed. follow through on his commitment."

Armed troops surround hijacked Japanese jet 
Damascus, Syria [AP] -A hijacked Japanese airliner landed at the Damascus airport early Monf.ay with 40 persons--including 29I' Jst­ages reported still aboard. 
The Japan Air Lines DC8' nded at 5:28a.m. (11:28 p.m. E1 ,) and was immediately surrounded by armed troops in a remote comer of the airfield 15 miles from Damas­cus. 
The Japanese Foreign Ministry said it had a report from Damascus that the five Japanese Red Army guerrilias would free 10 hostages in the Syrian capital, and that the ten would include two of the three Americans reported still held cap­tive. But it said it did not know the names of those to be released. 
Seven other hostages were released during a refueling stop in Kuwait, because they were ill, Kuwait Defense Minister Sheik Saad Abdullah said. They included four Japanese,two Australians and a New Zealander. 
Japan Air Lines officials in Tokoyo said the JAL DC8 circled over the Kuwait airport for about an hour before the government of the Persian Gulf emirate permitted it to land. 
The jetliner had left Bangladesh after a terror-filled five and one­half day siege at Dacca airport. 
The hijackers, identified as members of the ultra-leftist Japa­nese "Red Army," had seized the jetliner over India on Wednesday and, in the course of round-the­clock _negotiations with Banglades~ authorities, freed 118 of the1r hostages in exchange for $6 million in ransom and six "comrades" freed from Japanese jails.

Women organize rape-prevention 
Editor's Note: This is the first of a three part series discussing proposed solutions to the problem of the security of women on campus. The first article deals with rape-prevention education. 
by Ann Gales Senior Staff Reporter 
Students for Campus Security {SCS), a group organized by sev­eral Notre Dame graduate women concerned with the present security situation on campus, recently sub­mitted a five-point proposal on campus security to Dean of Stu­dents James Roemer. 
The proposal includes sug­gestions intended to increase se­curity on campus through modif-. · ications in the areas of educational programs, lighting, communica­tions, transportation and security personnel. 
Roemer said that he was in the process of looking into the proposal and would not be prepared to comment for approximately two weeks, at which time he would release an open letter to the Notre Dame community. 
However, other University of­
ficials and persons concerned with 
the issue of campus security voiced 
their opinions regarding the prob­
lem areas discussed in the pro­
posal. 
According to Paula Fulks, a 
second-year-law student and one of 
the organizers of SCS, the present 
program of rape-prevention ed­
ucation on campus needs consider­
able revision. Agreeing with Fulks 
was Associate Provost Sr. John 
Miriam Jones, who described her 
responsibilities as ''the well-being 
of the co-education system." 
Jones outlined the measures 
presently taken by the University to 
educate female students on how to 
guard against rape and sexual 
attacks. Each fall, she explained, 
a special orientation program is 
held for incoming freshmen co-eds. 
This program is presented· at a 
campus-wide meeting for all 
'incoming women, and also in each 
of the individual women's resi­
dence halls. 
Jones said that the University 
... 
owns periodicals and shows a movie entitled "How to Say No to a Rapist and Survive.'' This movie is based on a book written by Frederic Storaska, executive director of the National Organization for the Pre­vention of Rape and Assault. Also, campus security distributes pamphlets regarding rape-preven­tion to all undergraduate women each year. 
Fulks and Jones agreed that the present education should be expanded to only 
.· · but 
cessful, he said, as a total of nine 
rapes and attempted rlj.pes have 
been reported since June of 1975. 
Purdue Police Chief Donald 
Jones stated that only one attempt­
ed rape has been reported on 
campus since 1975, although he 
agreed with Huntington that a 
number of sex crimes probably go 
unreported each year. 
"Using good, common sense has 
a lot to do with avoiding the , problem of rape," chief Jones observed. "I think it's a good idea to inform the women, then let them prevent these things from happen­
ing." 
Lt. Joseph Molnar of the St. 
Joseph County Police commented 
favorably on the programs sponsor­
ed by police at Purdue and IU. 
"We would certainly consider 

.: ': starting such a program," he :. ': stated. "In fact, we do have a · ,. ' ·: two-hour mini-seminar prepared 
.· .. , , , · which consists of films and a short · · · · · lesson on defensive tactics." 
However, Molnar said that he felt police should work with Univer­sity security and student groups in developing a program of security education. "It is important to-work with University agencies because they are really in charge when it comes to campus rapes," he said, adding, "We don't want to force ourselves on anyone." 
Fulks said that she thought the IU and Purdue programs were ''a fairly good idea,'' though she expressed uncertainty as to whether the best approach to solution of the problem would be through the police. 
As to the general problem of 
campus rape, Molnar stated that he 
believed publicity should be limited 
to campus media. "Of course the 
problem is extremely important,'' 
he said. "One rape in any given 
time period is too many. You 
couldn't pay a million dollars to 
cover the damage done to a victim 
of rape." 
But Molnar commented that too 
much outside publicity would prob­
ably be detrimental to the situa­
tion. ."It's good to keep the problem in 'the house," he concluded. 
End of part one. Tomorrow's article will deal with lightlag and communications. 
"I that the program is effective, but it's hard to measure the exact number of rapes that have been prevented," IU Police Director George Hunting­ton said. 
Huntington revealed that the program was developed as part of an extensive rape-prevention cam. paign that was initiated after 15 rapes were reported in the summer of 1973. The campaign appears to· haye .been at least partially sue­

Carroll houses undergrads 
by John Mahon 
Carroll Hall has recently been 
converted to a residence hall for 
Notre Dame undergraduates. 
Formerly a hall for Holy Cross 
Brothers and graduate students, it 
was used first this year to accomo­
date an overflow· of freshmen 
students, but will now continue as a 
full fledged undergraduate dorm. 
There are seventy-three students 
living at Carroll, of which fifty-five 
are freshman. They are enthusias­
tic about the new hall, and eager to 
build hall spirit. 
Hall elections were held this past 
weekend, and all candidates ex­
pressed desires to make the hall 
more attractive and accesible. 
Particularly slated for renovation is 
the large unfinished basement. 
"Hopefully we can make it into a 
game and recreation room where 
all the students can meet," said 
St. Mary's seniors sponsor contest; plan activities 
by Sue BaUmann 
The Senior Class of St. Mary's is sponsoring a T-shirt contest. Designs should be submitted in actual color and size on a piece of paper to either 451 LeMans or 453 LeMans. The deadline for entries is Monday, October 10, and the prize consists of $20 and a free T-shirt. 
The Senior Class also needs chairmen for a number of commit­tees for graduation including tickets, Senior Mass, baccalaureate Mass, cocktail party, housing co­ordination, graduation brunch, and the Alumnae-Senior Brunch. Vol­unteers are needed as well to develop the idea of an award to be presented to an outstanding person who is admired by the seniors. Any questions should be referred to Maureen Morris, 4524, or Nancy Mogab, 5127.

one freshman. 
Carroll is located in a rather isolated part of the campus, which provides both advantages and dis­advantages. One freshman, Tim Mikula said, "It is too far to go to the library, but at least we didn't get raided by Dillon." 
Other students expressed the view that the isolation helps pro­mote comraderie between the stu­dents. Hall Rector, Bro. Paschal Pesce commented, "We have a real family atmosphere here." 
"The fact that the students are all thrown in together leads to more closeness between us," said Tom Stevenson. "It makes living togt­ther more enjoyable." 
Carroll Hall was originally de­signed as a residence for Holy Cross Brothers in the nineteen thirties. It was later partially converted to a graduate student residence, a dual function it served up until this time. 
The Carroll Hall Annex formerly served as the Naval ROTC convoca· tion hall, but is now used by the hall itself.

Oktoberfest termed successful 
by Anne Bachle 

Oktoberfest '77, which began last Wednesday and concluded Saturday, was "a big success", according to Oktoberfest Chair­person Kathy Friday. 
Extra attractions like the special night at Senior Bar, Gil Eagles' performance, and the stereo raffle all contributed to the overall success of the annual event, Friday noted. 
Several hundred students were present for the Thursday evening performance of Gil Eagles, a psychic and hypnotist, and Friday expressed disappointment that more people didn't see him. 

"He was very entertaining," she commented," and perhaps we can have him back again next semes­ter, because I think everyone there really enjoyed him." 
"I saw the Amazing Kreskin last year," Junior Meg Kelly com­mented,"and I thought Eagles' show was a lot better." 
"The Biergarten Friday night was, of course, a huge success," said Friday, noting that over seven hundred students were attracted to the festivities which included beer and snacks in Regina North Lounge while the band "Sahara" played in the South Lounge. 
Winner of the raffle for a Pioneer stereo was Matthew Hagerty, a Morrissey freshman, "I couldn't 

Student-run businesses regulated by University 
by Kate Flynn Staff Reporter 

Although the Notre Dame Book­store holds no official policy con­cerning student businesses on cam­pus, the University will not tolerate a "laissez-faire policy on private businesses run by students", according to Bro. Kieran Ryan, assistant vice president for Busi­ness Affairs. 
The Student Union merchandis­ing policy, drawn up last semester provides that any request for student businesses on campus must be submitted to the Service 
Commission  before  approval  by  
Student  Activities  Director  Br.  
John Benesh.  

The product to be sold must meet the merchandising policy's criteria: it must be unique, and not be in direct competition with the Book­store. 
Planner Records, a seven-year­old student-owned concession, poses a special problem to the policy, according to Mike Schlg-
ACS health care program planned 
The American Cancer Society 
(ACS) of St. Joseph County will conduct three days of public educa­tion on general health care today, tomorrow, and Wednesday, focus­ing on colorectal cancer followed by a colorectal screening program next Monday. 
Pat Rooney, Educational Service Director of St. Joseph Hospital, South Bend and a volunteer, will speak today and tomorrow. Inclu­ded will be the showing of the film "On With Your Life." 
All four days of the programming will be held at the Howard Park Senior Citizens Center, E. Jeffer­son Blvd. and St. Louis, from 1:30 to 2:30p.m. 
"Colorectal cancer affects both men and women equally and will claim more lives this year than any other type of cancer except skin,'' states Ed Stark, ACS Area Direc­tor. ''This is a surprising statistic to most people and that is· why we are emphasizing the education and screening program. Fortunately colorectal cancer is usually quite simple and easy to cure when detected early". 
St. Mary's holds Career Seminar 
by Honey McHugh 
eter of the Service Commission, because it undersells and competes directly with the Bookstore. 

According to Schlageter, the merchandising clause was written to prevent students from having complications with the state tax . laws and permits, since the Univer­sity would be held liable. Schlag­eter added, however, that he thinks the University does not wish to encourage competition with the Bookstore since its revenue is used to offset the cost of tuition. 
He said the Flanner Records situation raises the theoretical question of whether students want "a good deal or lower tuition." 
Ryan insisted that the regulation of student businesses is in the student's best interests. He denied that regulations were written to guarantee the Bookstore's monop­oly on campus and pointed that the duLac merchandising code does not even mention the Bookstore. Ryan claimed that unregulated student­operated businesses which dupli­

cate  services  provided  by  the  
University  do  not  work  to  the  
student's advantage.  

Flanner Records representative George Molitor claimed that stu­dents can save as much as one dollar per record over Bookstore prices. 
Along with Planner Records, the on-campus Adidas concession and the Miller and Anheuser Busch concessions will be carefully exa­mined before any apporval by the Service Commission and Student Activities. 
Schlageter said the Student Uni­on will exercise caution in approv­ing these businesses since the products they offer may be in violation of the merchandising policy's stipulation that a product be "unique". The beer conces­sions may be breach of the Univer­sity drinking regulations. 
The Service Commission reports that to date only the birthday cake concession has fulfilled the regis­tration requirement. All other concessions are urged to register with the Service Commission. Failure to comply with registration requirements will r.esult in a fine determined by Student Affairs of Student Activities, according to Schlageter. 
Copies of the Merchandising Policy are available at the Student Union offices on the second floor of LaFortune.

The Worst of Du Lac 
.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.--.~tom byrne 
Since the University's announce­
ment of its intention to make 
sweeping changes in the disciplin­
ary process, the du Lac student 
manual has finally begun to receive 
some much-needed scrutiny from 
the student body. Students, of 
course, have always been aware 
that a number of rules exist which 
they are obliged to follow if they 
wish to remain on campus. Yet it is 
unlikely a great many have read the 
actual sections of du Lac which 
define these rules and outline the 
procedures followed when students 
face disciplinary action. The 
prolonged debate over the judicial 
process will hopefully induce a few 
more people to read du Lac and 
learn something more about Notre 
Dame. 

Tho5e who are familiar with du 
Lac and its provisions are acquaint­
ed with the shortcomings which 
abound throughout the rules, regu­
lations and disciplinary proced­
ures. What follows is a brief 
description of parts of du Lac which 
merit special recognition because 
of their acute need for revision. 
l. "All vloladons are at the dlsposldon of the Dean of Stu­dents." 
There is nothing inherently wrong with this statement, but the scope of the rules and regulations the dean is charged with enforcing is far too broad. lncludeit as violations of University rules are the use of marijuana in the hall and all parietals violations, an arrange­ment that ignores the discretion each rector requires to administer discipline properly in his hall. Many rectors, especially those with more experience, regularly handle parietals and minor marijuana of­fenses themselves, in direct con­flict with du Lac. Newer rectors, however, tend to abide more strictly by the rules and refer all violations to dean of students, creating a serious inequity between halls. a change in status of parietals and the use of marijuana to hall offenses would remedy this situation considerably, while also reducing the caseload of the dean of students. Rectors would still reserve the right, as in the current du Lac, to send repeated or flagrant violations to ·the dean if they choose. 
2. "Students subject to disciplin­ary acdon may choose to have their cases considered by the rector, provided the rector accepts They will otherwise have their cases considered by the Hall Board."

I 


Perhaps no other part of du Lac is in more urgent need of attention than this description of the hall judicial boards, listed under the heading "Disciplinary Proced­ures." A survey of the residence halls would indicate that less than four halls have anything resembl­ing such a system. Lack of cooperation from the rectors and the small number of violations occurring in some halls are the principal causes for the weakness of the j-boards. In most halls, rectors handle all disciplinary mat­ters themselves, and many stu­dents are unaware that the option of a j-board hearing exists. As it presently stands, du Lac almost ridicules the disciplinary system in the halls. 
3. "When funcdonlng properly, the dormitory vlsltatJon programs should be regulated by students." 
This seemingly satirical lang­uage appears as a partof University rule governing parietals and exem­plifies one of du Lac's most obvious difficulties. The University's more controversial rules, such. as those regarding parietals, sexuality and alcohol use, are accompanied by elaborate justifications for these policies often at such length that it becomes challenging to separate rule from rhetoric. Besides leading to confusion, it may also convey the impression that a community con­sensus has been achieved on matters like parietals, which is anything but the case. 
4. "The Uulvenlty reserves the right to transfer a student's resl· dence." 
Lurking innocently among the University regulations, this provis­ion has a colorful history of abuse that certifies its status as du Lac's biggest loophole. Rectors, in particular, cherish this authority, , 
since they can banish uncoopera­tive students from their halls without accusing them of any specific offense, effectively side­stepping all disciplinary proced-. ures. This power was exercised several times last year, the most publicized episode being the case of the "Sorin 7," who were transferred right off campus.

give the dean the power to punish off-campus students who violate University rules concerning alcohol abuse, marijuana, and premarital sex. 
du Lac is interesting because it furnishes some insight into the University-'s view of its relationship with the students: Notre Dame is a family, headed by parental admin­istrators and composed chiefly of impressionable young adults who need a great deal of guidance. Discipline is accordingly regarded as an administrative process and procedures followed are only de­signed to transmit a sense of fairness to the accused student. ,The ultimate truth of the system is that if the University wants a student expelled, ther'! is nothing he can do about it.

Loyalty sold for tickets 
Dear Editor: 
I am writing to Mr. Gryp to remind him to send my USC football tickets as soon as possible. Until I read of the Student Union policy conceroing work and reward, I was under the mistaken impres­sion that I donated my time because I enjoyed being a member of the Marching Band. Fortunately my eyes have been opened and I 
await his offer so that I, too, might sell loyalty. I spend 20 hours per week learning various marching routines and memorizing music without any financial renumeration (as do the rest of the band, and many other volunteer groups). Doesn't this qualify me for an option to buy homecoming football tickets?--especially since I've never seen one of the Union commission­ers dripping with sweat or freezing to oeath while carrying a thirty-five pound ledger book during their donated time. 
If the members ofthe Union (and· I doubt that more than a handful actually feel this way) believe they need some reward to keep their loyalty or maintain their efficient operating level, then there is something wrong with either the Union's organization or with those members themselves. Or doesn't old-fashioned pride count 
anymore? David 0. Childers Jr. 


Loyal fans criticized 
Dear Editor:. I was very much amazed by the ND spirit shown by the fans at last 
Saturday's Michigan State game. I would like to give a hand to all those people who so kindly booed some of the ND players at the game. I hope these people realize that these players are also their fellow classmates. It is time the football players stopped being so criticized for their mistakes by the "loyal fans." I always believed "loyal fans" cheered their team on, no matter what happened, but at ND I see this is not the rule. 
The football team is composed of people, who but for their size and athletic prowess are just like every­one else. It is time football players were treated more like people with feelings and personalities and Jess like football players. No one has the license to boo a fellow student on the playing field or off. So next time one of them makes a human mistake or doesn't have an excep­tiona) game, as their fans, we should unite and cheer them on even stronger the next time. 
Remember, football players are 
people, too, and ~he uniform personal aura, and Notre Dame's doesn't change them many way. potent and prestigious public aura,

Concert? 
 Dear Edltor:­Miss Anita Bryant, wholesome All-American ex-runner-up Miss America, purveyor of orange juice, presumed heterosexual political crusader plugging dykes wherever allowed against the rising tide of civil rights for homosexuals, will apparently perform at the Notre Dame ACC during the students' absence over midsemester break. I believe it is accurate to say that Miss Bryant has acquired a politi­cal aura, abhorrent to some, reas­suring to others. Notre Dame, whose president headed the U.S. Civil Rights Com­mission, whose Civil Rights Center, dedicated presumably to the progressive extension of civil rights, is a major research reposi­t~y for civiL rights scholars, has agreed to rent Miss Bryant its hall. Apparently the University feels 
that this action is merely a business deal, divorced from political impli­cations, which does not necessarily constitute official endorsement -of Miss Bryant's non-professional political views. By the same rea­soning, if such Is the University's reasoning, Notre Dame's facilities should as readily be rented with equal equanimity to the Ku Klux Klan, the American Nazi Party, or Richard Nixon, should any of these people, to name but a few, wish to stage a (presumably non-political) performance, and have money enough to rent the hall. Providing facilities for such performances would presumably not constitute endorsement of their political views either, and would, furthermore, advance the cause of freedom of speech (to those who can afford to rent the hall). 
Given Miss Bryant's current 
auras in her appearance at Notre Dame, may discriminate less finely between the University's locally stated neutrality and the simpler implications of Miss Bryant's pub­licized performance here. 
The potential demagoguery asso­ciated with Miss Bryant's appear· ance, and its potential impact on the general public's already often misinformed impression of the University's nature and views, seem inescapable. 
The letter of Notre Dame's official position may be literally neutral, but the spirit in which Notre Dame avoids the political implications of this impending event seems questionable. I won­der would Notre Dame extend equal facilities for highly-publi­cized events to the Ku Klux Klan, the American Nazi's, or Nixon, to name but a few?

Refugee reports : 
Ugandan terror stories 
NAIROBI, Kenya [AP]--Jacob Mugisha is a 36-year-old Ugandan refugee now living in the Kenyb.n capital of Nairobi. There is little to mark him out from the thousands of other Ugandans who have sought sanctuary in Kenya to escape the tyranny of the rule of Idi Amin. 
But Mugisha says that until the end of his days he will carry a burden of guilt from which there is no escape. 
Two and a half years ago he spent more than one month in one of Amin's prisons, he says, and there he was forced to batter to death more than 20 of his fellow prisoners, one of them a friend. 
Mugisha was brought into con­tact with The Associated Press by another Ugandan refugee. He pro­duced a written account of his experiences and this was expanded upon by him orally during ques­tioning. 
Travel to Uganda by news cor­respondents is sharply restricted and thus independent confirmation of his account is not available. Nor could the exact details of prison life in Uganda be confirmed through other Ugandan refugees here. 
But Mugisha's story is consistent with the stories of terror told by many other Ugandans who have fled. 
Various international human rights agencies have estimated that as many as 100,000 or more Ugandans have been brutally killed since Amin seized power in a military coup in January 1971. There have been persistent reports that one common method of execu­tion is for Amin"s police and security men to force prisoners to kill each other. 
Nobody knows how many Ugan­dans have died in this manner. But Mugisha says that at the prison of Amin's much-feared Public Safety Unit (PSU) on the Kampala-Jinja road, about three miles from the capital of Kampala, it is the most favored form of execution. 
The PSU, the military police and Amin's secret police, the State Research Bureau, are the three organizations of terror through which Amin maintains his power. They are staffed almost entirely by Moslems from the southern Sudan and A min's own minority Kakwa tribe. 
Mugisha said he was arrested by the PSU on Apri120, 1975, while on vacation from his job as a clerk at Barclay's Bank in Kampala. He said he was accused of helping to steal 100,000 shillings, about $20,000, from the bank. 
He said he was taken to the PSU "death camp" at Naguru and put in a cell in the block where he claimed the killings are carried out. He described the block as an oblong, black building with a courtyard in the middle, surround­ed by a compound cut off from the rest of the prison by a wire fence. 
After being taken to the cell, Mugisha said, he was then beaten to unconsciousness. Two days later, he said, he was selected to be killed that night along with three other prisoners. He named them as Fred Musoke, Tom Galabuzi and a Mr. lutymanga. 
"One of the cells in the block is reserved for those who have been chosen to die," he said. "We were taken to the cell and at about 9:30 
p.m. the camp killer Col. Myanzi came with two policemen. They started calling us out one by one into the courtyard and then the compound. Musoke was the first to be called. Then they called my name. 
"I went out and was told I had been called to kill Musoke with a heavy, thick iron bar. I looked round and saw police with machine guns guarding us. I was shocked to see that I was going to have to kill 
myfriend. 
"I was ordered by the killer in a loud voice to beat him on the head. That's what I did. I beat him to death. Then they told me to put him in a Land-Rover. 
"Then they brought Galabuzi who was employed by the Ministry of Works. I did the same thing to him and put him in the Land-Rover. After that they also brought lutymanga and I also killed him," he said. 
Each ofthe men, he said, had his hands tied behind his back and his legs bound together. He beat them to death as they lay on the ground, he said. 
"Before I left Naguru on May 24, 1975, I killed more than 20 people," Mugisha said. "Every night I was killing one or two people. There were other prisoners doing the same job. But I did the most. 
"Nobody can know what it is to have the choice of either killing or being killed. I hate to think what I have done." 
He described how he was forced to execute his victims: On the instructions of the prison guards he

would carry them from the court­yard to the compound and throw them on the ground. Then with the heavy iron bar, he said, he would hit them with all his strength on the back of the neck. After that he was ordered to batter his victims' faces into a pulp so they could not be recognized, he said. 
More than 200 people were killed in this way during his time in the camp, Mugisha estimated. 
He said his worst memory is of killing Musoka, whom he described as being 17 years old. Musoke was accused of stealing money, but denied this. 
After his month as a camp executioner, Mugisha said, he was taken before a court in Kampala and sentenced to one year in Luzira Prison after pleading guilty to stealing the money. 
Before he completed his sen­tence, he said, he was able to raise 5000 shillings, about $600, to buy his freedom. He fled to neighbor­ing Rwanda but returned last year.

Bergin works to improve the Arts 
Dr. Thomas P.Bergin, dean of Continuing Education, participated this past weekend in a national conference, "The Arts, Education and Americans, Inc." at Columbus. Bergin joined David Rockefeller, Jr., national chairman, in leading the discussion of a recent publication, "Coming To ·Our Senses." 
The purpose of the conference, the first of several to be held in the nation, was to obtain reactions and suggestions on the publication of the National Arts Committee, and to serve as a catalyst to improve existing arts in education programs. 
Bergin is former chairman of the Indiana Arts Commission and has held several major positions in national organizations.

Mrs. Aglialoro, of New York City, had to travel to England on short notice because of a death in the family. She would have had to pay $675, she said, if the 5238.25 Skytrain fare was not available.

Drugs linked to increase in rural crime rate 
Indianapolis [AP]--Serious crime appears to be increasing in once­peaceful rural areas oflndiana, and some experts say that drugs are invariably a common denominator. 
State  Police  Lt.  Oscar  Gates,  
pointmg  to  a  series  of  widely  
publicized  murders  in  recent  

months over a five-county area northwest of Indianapolis, main­tains that there is probably a drug tie-in in nearly every unsolved murder in rural Indiana. 
Gates, who is assistant to the commander of the inv:stigation division, admits the persons who committed such crimes may not have been acting under the influ­ence of drugs at the time. 
However, he says, " ...the sus­pect always turns out to have been a user, a dealer or whatever." 
His opinion is backed up by Edmund W. Grosskopf, assistant professor of criminology at Indiana State University, who says the drug connection fits in with the growth of rural crime and the ability of those who commit the crimes to elude detection in a rural setting. 
"For one thing, you can attribute this crime growth to improvements in the means of transportation," says Grosskopf, who believes many criminals have learned that drugs can be dealt, crimes committed and even the bodies of murder victims dumped in settings where the probability of detection is small. 
''The fact that crime is so non-detectable in the country is one reason why I expect it grows there," he says. 
Grosskopf points to the hundreds of miles of country roads and 
URD offers free legal advice 
by Frank Laurino 

The University Referrals Divi­sion (URD) of the Notre Dame Legal Aid and Defender Associa­tion (NDLADA) provides free legal research, counselling, and repre­sentation to eligible Notre Dame and St. Mary's students. 
The service, which operates out of the Law School basement, is practically unknown to students, claims Richard Cahill, a third year law student who is a member of the group. 
"We deal exclusively with stu­dents," explains Cahill. "We try to assist them in many areas, helping the student find out where he stands on legal matters." 
The URD deals with a wide range of cases, including disputes with off-campus housing leases and businesses in the South Bend area. It also handles problems students might have with employers, con· tracts, personal torts, auto acci­dents, and police agencies. 
''We get cases where students get arrested for public, intoxica­tion," said Cahill. "We also have to us for help." 
Cahill emphasized the necessity of student eligibility requirements for each case handled. "Every student who comes to us must fill out a financial form in addition to a case interview form," he said. "Because of legislation restric­tions, the student must prove he is unable to afford an attorney." 
According to Cahill, the group might involve itself in a malpractice suit if that restriction is violated. "The URD is unable to accept a fee-generating case because it would take away business 'from attorneys in the city," he said. 
Cahill stat 'that "most students would qua!if, He added that the URD and lm; South Bend Public Defender's Onice often refer cases to each other. "We both know we can be of ser" ·e to each other," he said. 
Many stud ts have little know­ledge of th... ,. ega! rights, accord­ing to Cahill. "They also don't know how to function within admin­istrative systems, be it an Indiana Court or the university administra­

gets an out-of-state traffic ticket after a football weekend." 
The URD occasionally handles defenses of lawsuits against stu­dents. "This will happen, for example, when a student gets in a auto accident and has no insur­ance, explained Cahill. "In that case, we hope the student will turn 
Cahill stressed the importance of the URD research into legal ques­tions. "That'·· why we're here: to appear with a student during a hearing for disciplinary action. They can, however, advise a student before the hearing. "We like to involve ourselves with other student problems, however," said Cahill.

Those "problems" could arise, he hypothesized, 'rom situations where a student arrested for a minor misdeJTl .. ·nor is denied counsel. "This , 'ppens through

The URD will conduct lectures and proposes television/radio spots to help inform the ND-SMC com­munity of their legal rights, stated Cahill. "We also plan to publish a handbook on student rights, legal questions and procedures," he added. 
The service is manned by second and third law students. Third year students are allowed by Indiana state legislation to represent clients in court. The URD is composed of both volunteer law students and those who work for graduate level credit.

thousands of local residents that a handful of deputies are frequently responsible for safeguarding. It usually takes longer for police to respond to an emergency in sparse­ly populated areas, he says, and such rural country--with little poverty--is often an inviting target for wrong-doers. "Many people who are on drugs cannot hold a 
job," added Gates. "They are dependent on the drugs and will do what they have to to get them." 
Gates cited six recent murder cases in the area west and north­west of Indianapolis to illustrate the upsurge in violent crime in the area. He strongly suspects a drug connection in most of them: 
-The February murders of four Parke County brothers, for which Roger C. Drollinger, 24, of Wayne­town, was recently convicted, while three other suspects await trial. Drollinger had a history of drug arrests and convictions. 
-The March slaying of a Wolcott trucking executive, who was killed by a shotgun blast as he drove along U.S. 231 in White County. There have been no arrests in the case. 
-The discovery of the body of a missing Purdue University co-ed along a Tippecanoe County lovers' lane in June. In that unsolved case, police have no information that the victim was ever involved with drugs. 
-The Execution-style slaying of two Putnam County youths in July. Drug apparatus was found near their bodies, and police speculate the murderers in the case were seeking either drugs or money. 
-The shooting death of a Montgo mery County farmer on property he farmed in August. In that case, police arrested a suspect who has a record of drug violations. 
-The unsolved strangulation death of a 30-year-old Clinton County mother of three whose body was discovered in the trunk of her car in Lafayette in August. No arrest has been made in the case.

Irish offense rambles for 315 yards rushing 
Notre Dame dominates MSU 16-6 
by Bob Keen Sports Writer 

The last time the Michigan State Spartans entered Notre Dame Sta­dium, they shocked the Irish 10-3. However, if State fans expected history to repeat itself on Saturday, they left bitterly disappointed as Notre Dame dominated its home opener en route to a 16-6 victory before a capacity crowd of 59,075. 
With Joe Montana starting as Irish quarterback for the first time in almost two years, Notre Dame's offense continued to execute in the explosive manner which character­
ized last week's fourth quarte~exhibition against Purdue. On th first series of the game Montana fired a perfect pass to tight end Ken MacAfee covering 43 yards, pushing the Irish deep into Spartan territory. Eight plays later Notre Dame had a first down on the

However, State's Mark Anderson stepped in front of Irish placekicker Dave Reeve moved into third place on Notre Dame's all-time scoring list, passing Gus Dorais who played from 1910-13.

Greg Solman Plugging Up The Middle 
Journal 

Yes, Virginia ... there are signs of life on the Notre Dame offense. The 
game itself was ratl1cr nondescript. Though there ws little doubt 
throughout the game that the Irish would win. costly turnovers kept a 
possible Irish offensive breakthrough at bay ... but there was a glimmer 
of hope in it all. 

The offensive line started executing better than they had, as Coach Brian Buulac expected them to. Notre Dame found itself another running back this weekend in the person of Dave Mitchell. Collecting 91 yards in 25 carries, Mitchell. along with backfield mate Jerome Heavens (23 carries for 136 yards) epitomized a general upsurgence in the Irish offense. In short, the Irish offense was moving the ball better than they had all season Saturday, and one has to hope the tempo will continue to increase for the rest of the season. 
The defense was sterling as usual. and although a lot of ink has been spilled about how strong our defensive ends are, and justifiably so, Irish fans should remember that if Bob Golic weren't there, teams would simply go right up the middle. 
Golic, one of the nation's outstanding linebackers, is playing a season describable through only two words: All-American. Golic continued his All-America play this Saturday, collecting eighteen tackles to take over 
the team lead in that .:ategory. 

Golic has always been a goal-setter. When he came to Notre Dame his freshman year, he was determined to start on the varsity. When Tom Eastman go injured against Northwestern the third game of the season, Golic got his chance. He's been the Notre Dame middle linebacker ever since. 
Last year, Golic wanted to make somebodies All-America team. This, of course, he atso accomplished, as The Sporting News' honorable mention choice for the spot. 
This year, Golic should be everyone's All-American. He's playing with spirit, intensity and leadership, at a pressure-filled position and he's takin all of that pressure with a grain of salt. "I know that I'm going to be out there trying to do my job as best I can whether we're winning or losing. Hopefully, for the rest of the season, we'll be winning." 
With Golic shoring up the middle as he has been, that might be possible, and Golic's talents don't stop on the football field, though he calls it "his greates passion." In fact, Golic's 38 career wins in wrestling made him an All-American in that sport last year. 
In football, Golic has emerged as the Irish's most outstanding defensive player thus far this year, and he attributed this improvement to his loss of 30 pounds from his weight this spring. According to him, it's improved his game to a noticeable degree, both in his quickness and his endurance. · 
Against Michigan State, Golic was upended from his blindside and took 
a flip which left him dazed and frustrated. But for Golic, the worst part of Saturday's game occurred in the stands, when Rusty Lisch was "booed" discernably as he took th field to replace Joe Montana who had lost a shoe and cut the back of his foot.
