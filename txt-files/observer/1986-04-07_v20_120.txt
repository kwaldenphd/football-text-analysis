Salt-shaker gag, burnt toast mar dining hall experience 
There are a lot of things I like about Notre Dame. None of them spring to mind at the moment, but I'm sure they exist. This is understandable, however, con­sidering that I've just returned from one of the two fine dining establishments of this University -North Dining Hall. 
I hate the dining halls. 
Now Mr. Hickey, don't get hysterical and start flashing your Ivy Award at me. Amazingly enough, it is not the food about which I am complaining. (That was last year's article anyway.) It is instead the ill­mannered boors with whom I share spanikopita. 
Everyone knows the scenario. You calmly walk toward the dining hall, to all outward appearances a rational, level-headed individual. However, lurking somewhere deep inside is an animal just waiting to be aroused by the aromatic scents of Italian night. 
You enter the dining hall, still assuming the polite facade. Your outward cool begins to break down somewhat when the checkers inform you that your ID needs to be re-magnetized. They are completely un­moved by the various bribes you offer them. 
Having gone to the basement of South Dining Hall to get your ID, to once again attest that you do in fact exist, you re-enter the lobby just in time to encounter the 12:15 lunch "line," (a term inaccurately applied to the crushes of humanity which push and elbow their way toward the .slop ... er, the foo4.). 
Once you have actually managed to assemble silver­ware, napkins, and whichever of the three entrees you find least repulsive, you steal yourself for the next bat­tle-the pop machines. 
I have often fantasized about what it would be like to be Tim Kempton or Ken Barlow, who must regard the scuttling crowds jockeying for position below them with a mild sense of co ntempt as they casually stride through the throng with six easily-filled glasses. As I am one of that throng, however, and since my five-foot frame is not exactly a strategic advantag~ I generally emerge from the tangle of arms splashed with Coke and cursing my peers. 
My disgruntlement continues through the ''meal" (use your imagination) as all sorts of surprises and ir­ritations await. My personal favorite is the old "1-bet­you-thought-that-salt-was-going-to-come-out-of-this­salt-shaker" gag, whose effect is enhanced by the hysterical laughter of my friends as milk tumbles onto my french fries. (I of course, naively expected salt). 
Other pet peeves of mine include people who put the peanut butter scoops into the jelly, throw butter pats onto walls from 15 feet away just to see if they stick (they do), steal my bagels from the toaster while I am

in search of. cream cheese, and stack five trays on top of each other when the conveyor belt is temporarily stalled. (Note their astonishment when the aforemen­tioned trays crash to the floor). 
But I really shouldn't exclude myself from the list of etiquette offenders. Even though I am not guilty of any of these crimes, I engage in an ongoing battle with the mechanical devices in the dining hall, which I'm sure causes untold grief to the people unlucky enough to be behind me in line. 
The pyromaniac in me emerges as I approach the toaster and casually throw in a hapless piece of bread, which soon becomes an inferno, billowing smoke through the dining hall and defying my frantic efforts to dislodge it from the slot. At this point, I generally slime away, leaving the person behind me to battle the flames unassisted. 
Other evidence of my mechanical incompetence is my cluelessness at the cereal dispensers in South Din­ing Hall, which require a PhD in physics to operate, and the hot chocolate machines in North Dining Hall, which spontaneously continue to spew forth steaming liquid oblivious to the fact that my cup, tray, and all surrounding individuals are covered in it. 
Perhaps one day I will master the microwave and control my impatience with the lines and the hassles. But until then I will continue to battle it out three times a day.

Terrorism transforming world into free-fire zone, say experts 
Associated Prell8 
LONDON -A wanton war with 
no rules and little pity is turning the 
world, bit by bit, into a free-fire 
zone. 
International terrorism is strik­ing in numbing waves. It left at least 926 people dead worldwide in 1985, hundreds more than in any year since the U.S. State Depart­ment began compiling statistics in 1968. 
So far this year, at least 43 more 
have died, including five 
Americans killed in last week's 
bombings of a TWA jetliner and a 
West Berlin nightclub. 
But terrorism has left another casualty as well: the system of global order, which has been shaken by terrorism assaults that exposed weak spots in international law and the Western alliance, led the United States into military con­flict, and made vigilantes out of governments. 
A recent series of interviews in the United States, Europe and the Middle East, with security officials and diplomats, scholars and politi­cians, alleged terrorists and their defenders, found disagreement over how to combat terrorism and even how to define it. But almost all agreed that such "free-form" political violence will spread in the years to come. 
"Terrorism is with us now, whether you like it or not. You've got to adjust your way of life to that," said Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist chief, George Churchill-Coleman. 
Those interviewed also generally agreed on these other points: 
-As governments strengthen defenses of embassies and other of­ficial installations, terrorists will become more indiscriminate, at­tacking "softer" targets like the in­

nocent civilians massacred by Palestinians at Rome and Vienna airports last December. 
Terrorists will probably escalate 
to attacks on computer systems, 
power grids and other key links of 
industrial societies. 
Terrorist groups often maintain 
practical ties with each other, but 
are not joined together in a "grand 
conspiracy" against the West. 
As for defensive strategies, the security experts spoke most often of a need for better intelligence­gathering, particularly from within terror groups, and for closer cooperation among governments. 
But many spoke, too, of the need to address the problems that spawn terrorism. 
International terrorist incidents, those involving citizens or territory of more than one country, have doubled in number since 1975, to slightly over 800 last year, the State Department reports. Risks International, a U.S. consulting firm that tracks single-country ter­rorism as well, counted more than 3000 major incidents in 1985. 
Last year's TWA hijacking and Achille Lauro "seajacking" were more visible, but 1985's deadliest event was the downing of an Air­India jetliner over the Atlantic, believed to have been the work of Sikh extremist bombers. It killed all 329 aboard. 
Terrorism is not new. The 
French dubbed the 1890s, when anarchists tossed bombs into Pari­sian cafes, the "Dynamic Decade." 
What is new today is terrorism practiced on an international scale, a kind of global guerrilla war that has developed with developing technology. 
Jet travel and open borders, par­ticularly in West Europe, enable terrorists to reach far-off targets. A booming arms trade offers them the latest in compact, relatively cheap weapons in a nuclear age when traditional warfare is too costly. And instant communica­tions, advances in the news media, give their actions a "multiplier ef­fect." 


Terrorists' goals can be complex. West European groups, for exam­ple, are believed intent on provok­ing a police repression that will an­tagonize the public and pave the way for revolution. But, first and foremost, the experts say, terrorists crave attention for their cause. And the causes are proliferating. 
The "traditional" groups are well-known: Palestinian militants, Irish Republican Army Provi­sionals, Basque separatists, anti­Turkish Armenians, Colombia's M-19 guerrillas, Italy's right-wing railway bombers, Lebanon's multi­striped car-bombers. 
But now, ominously, more obscure causes are exploding into the headlines as well -the cause of Tamil separatism, for one, in whose name 150 bystanders were massacred by gunmen at a holy place in Sri Lanka last year. 
In the United States, too, new­style terrorists strike: "right-to­life" militants who firebomb abor­tion clinics, for example, and ter­rorist bombers, possibly Jewish ex­tremeists, who killed an Arab­American activist last year. Terrorists are also becoming deadlier. Lebanon's anti-Western Shiite Moslem extremists are work­ing with bombs of unparalleled power for a non-military organiza­tion. 
"The ferocity is escalating," a 
U.S. Air Force security officer in West Germany said of anti­American terrorists there. They are not getting the kind of attention they used to get, and they apparent­ly feel they have to find new ways to get it. 


Arab extremists focus of Berlin bomb probe 
Associated Press 
BERLIN Police in­vestigating a nightclub bombing that killed a U.S. army sergeant and a Turkish woman and wounded 191 other people are focusing on Arab extremists who may have entered West Berlin from Communist East Germany, news reports said Sunday. 
U.S. diplomats said Libyan leader Col. Moammar Khadafy was suspected of complicity in Saturday's bomb blast that destroyed the La Belle discothe­que, which was popular with American soldiers stationed in Berlin. 
Of the 191 injured, 63 were Americans. 
U.S. military and West Berlin authorities identified the two people killed as Sgt. Kenneth Ford, 21, of Detroit, and Ner­min Haney, 28, a Turk. 
"The Libyan angle is being ex­
plored very vigorously. Khadafy is a very active suspect," said a U.S. diplomatic source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
Khadafy called for Arab assaults on American interests worldwide after a U.S.-Libyan naval clash in the Mediterranean two weeks ago. 
U.S. officials in West Berlin refused further comment on the investigation launched by a special, 100-member commis­sion of West Berlin and American military police. 
Manfred Ganschow, director of West Berlin security police, said Sunday that three separate claims of responsibility telephoned the day of the explo­sion to news agencies in London and Berlin "cannot be con-

go into detail. 
The Berliner Morgenpost dai­
ly newspaper said investigators 
were focusing on anti-Western 
Arab militants in West Berlin. 
It quoted unidentified West 
Berlin security officials as say­
ing the Libyan Embassy in East 
Berlin, the capital of East Ger­
many, could have served as 
headquarters for the bombers. 
The Morgenpost quoted 
Ganschow as saying intelligence 
reports indicated "fanatical 
Arabs operating independently 
of one another" had slipped into 
West Berlin recently. 
Ganschow told a news con­
ference that investigators con­
tinued to zero in on leftist and 
foreign terrorist groups, but "no 
concrete clues" surfaced to iden­
tify the bombers. 
Of the three claims of respon­sibility dismissed by Ganschow on Sunday: 
An anonymous caller In Lon­don claimed a West German lef­tist terrorist faction, the Holger Meins Commando, committed the bombing. 
A caller in Berlin said a previously unknown radical Arab group, the Anti-American Arab Liberation Front, was responsible. 
A second caller in Berlin said it was the work of the Red Army Faction, a West German leftist terrorist grop that has waged a bombing and arson campai&n against NATO interests. 
In Bonn, the West German capital, Foreign Minister Hans­Dietrich Genscher established a working group of experts to see if foreign governments, not identified, could have been in­volved in the disco bombing.

U.S. should stick to arms treaty, says House chairman 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -The Reagan administration should reaffirm its commitment to the 1972 treaty limiting missile defenses instead of viewing the pact in a way that per­mits "Star Wars" research, the chairman of the House Foreign Af­fairs Committee said yesterday. 
Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., termed the administration's view of the treaty "defective and counter­productive" and said it would lead to a new arms race in space. 
Also yesterday, Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, asked the Air Force to formally support the single-warhead nuclear missile known as "Midgetman." 
Fascell's statement was the latest round in a six-montl old fight over whether the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty limits research and development into high-tech defenses against nuclear attack. 
The Reagan administration con­tends that the pact does not ban such research and is going ahead with the Star Wars plan, known formally as the Strategic Defense Initiative. 
The Soviets want SDI halted, but the administration says the 
American program is needea partly 
to offset a similar Soviet effort. · 
Administration officials, in­

cluding Secretary of State George 
Shultz, said last fall that in their 
view the administration was legally 
justified in a loose interpretation of 
the pact. But they promised to stick 
by a more strict definition they said 
would still permit SDI to go ahead. 
Both superpowers should reaf­firm their commitment to the ABM treaty, said Fascell, who is out of the country and made his views known in a statement issued by is office here. 
His is position taken previously by other critics of the administra­tion's build-up of nuclear weapons. 
Aspin's letter to Air Force Secretary Russell Rourke noted that the single-warhead missile has been endorsed by a presidential commission, which said it would increase stability in the superpower arms stand-off. 
Aspin noted that "there is a small minority" in the Defense Depart­ment that wants to cut spending on the Midgetman project and use that money for SDI, while other Pen­tagon opponents of the missile want to increase its size. 

Aspin and other supporters of Midgetman believe it would con­tribute to stability because they argue it is better to have a large number of missiles with single warheads rather than a smaller number of missiles with larger warheads, such as the triple­warhead Minuteman or 10­warheadMX. 
They argue that the MX would make a more inviting target to Soviet war planners considering a first strike because hitting on MX with one missile would knock out 10 warheads while it would take 10 Soviet missiles to destory the same number of Midgetman weapons.

Jordanian arms deal embarrassing; Saudi proposal will pass, Bush says 
Associated Press 
DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia ­Vice President George Bush said yesterday the Reagan administra­tion was "somewhat embarrassed" when Congress blocked a big sale of U.S. arms to Jordan, but he predicted that a $354 million pur­chase of advanced weapons by Saudi Arabia would win approval. 
Bush arrived in this eastern pro­vincial city on the Persian Gulf earlier in the evening from Riyadh for an official dinner with King Fahd. 
A business meeting, restricted to male guests and excluding Bush's wife, Barbara, was arranged to follow the dinner.

to Saudi Arabia improved recently when a major pro-Israel lobby in Washington, the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, signaled it would not actively oppose the deal. 
"I believe that this arms sale will go through. In my view it must go through," Bush told American businessmen at a breakfast meeting in Riyadh. "I think this one is in better shape than some of the other deals that have been aborted by the United States Congress." 
"We frankly were somewhat em­barrassed," he said, when Congress forced the administration to withdraw a $1.9 billion arms pur­chase by Jordan's King Hussein because of lack of progress toward Middle East peace talks. 
Since then, Bush said, Hussein 
crease of prices to consumers in poor countries at 49.3 percent for 1985, compared with 46.3 percent in 1984. The rate was especially high in Latin America: 164.2 per­cent, up from 145.3 the year before. There was a small decline in Asia to 6.8· percent and a larger one in the Middle East, to 12.5 percent from 16.3 percent. 
In the United States and 20 other industrial countries the average rate of inflation came to 4.2 percent, a steady drop from the 7.5 percent of 1982. 
The IMF memorandum, an of­ficial monthly publication, said the top rate of inflation was in Argen­tina, 672.1 percent for the year, followed by Brazil with 227 percent and Peru with 163.4 percent. Israel's inflation was running at an annual rate of nearly 172 percent in "kind of broke off discussions with us. We understand it in a sense because we said we were going to do something as the United States, we meant to do it, we wanted to do it, we felt it was in the interest of peace, and we weren't able to deliver because the U.S. Congress did not see it our way." 
At his meeting with businessmen in Riyadh, Bush reaffirmed the 
U.S. commitment to keep oil flow­ing through the gulf. 
Alluding to the U.S. military strike against Libya, Bush said the United States "is fundamentally, ir­revocably committed" to maintain the free flow of oil through the gulf region. "After this past month, no one should doubt the importance we attach to freedom of passage in international waters." 
January of this year, but it is reported to have dropped sharply since then. 
Decreases were noted in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Singapore and Sri Lanka, while sizable increases were shown for Burma, Nepal and Thailand. 
Among the industrial countries, the lowest inflation rates were in Japan, 2 percent, and West Ger­many, 2.2 percent. Inflation in the 
U.S. dropped to 3.6 percent from 
4.3 percent in 1984. 
The biggest rise was in New Zealand, to 15.4 percent from 6.2 percent. Iceland continued to have the largest inflation rate among the 
industrial  countries,  32  percent,  
compared  with  30.6  percent  in  
1984.

People, spirit make Notre Dame special place 
How many times have you heard someone complain about the Notre Dame administra­tion or the grounds crew or the weather? We hear complaints about the newfountain, Apar­theid divestment, parietals and du Lac. The dining halls are never perfect and The Ratio is always unsatisfactory. More often than not, these people wish they were somewhere else; they would rather be at Stanford or Princeton or Duke. Some go so far as to apply for trans­fers.

of divestiture about which the cranks have bleated on and on. But that idea has finally found a home and settled for a season in the porous minds ofexuberant youths. 
In a world of palpable and pervasive evils purveyed Soviet-style, in the real world of major league evils perpetrated by one of the most lurid and menacing policies which has been fabricated in a while, it is strange how so much fire can be misdirected at friendly and relatively harmless nations. So much passion and protest is brought to bear on the wrong people. And the thought behind this feverish passion and protest must be likewise strange, to be sure. 
In fact, it is simply ludicrous to think that life in South Africa, and even less our par­ticipation in that life, is the premiere object presently deserving our indignation, or to think that located there we find somehow the main moral axis about which our obligations now turn. 
Somewhere in the bewildering logic ofthis, 
though, something large and obvious has 
passed unperceived -something like balance 
or proportion or breadth ofjudgement.

Islam does not condone 
this issue any further. My understanding ofthe Quran is that it supports the concept of a jus­tified war, specifically a defensive war to protect territory or personal rights. Someth­ing which is very important to note is that Is­lam was intended to guide a whole society, including the government. It therefore takes positions on issues which Christianity "leaves to Caesar." 
Many courses of action have been taken throughout history by Islamic governments or groups which may seem appalling, but I do not think any more so than son1e actions of misguided Christian ones; the Crusades, the Inquisition, and Colonialism readily come to mind. Does the religion oflslam especially en­courage or allow terrorism? I really do not think so. Lebanese Christians are behaving in much the same fashion as are Lebanese Mus­lims. The situation itself seetns to produce the violence, as a not too dissimilar situation is producing violence in Ireland. 
I would like to mention some aspects of Is­lam which particulary appeal to me. First of all,there are the Muslitns themselves whom I have known; they shared with me their per­sonal questionings about the proper response to oppression. Many do argue to meet force with force; some tolerate terrorism as a prayer, mandatory contributions toward the support of the poor, respect for other religions and a great emphasis upon a fair and rational system ofjustice. The Sufis, a mystical branch ofIslam, are particularly committed to peace and spiritual growth. The practice ofin­dividuals and government can sometimes leave much to be desired, obviously. The cur­rent rise of intolerant fundamentalism, for ex­ample, is not attractive in its Islamic or in its Christian manifestations. 
The situation in some Islamic countries 
looks deplorable to us, but I think it is im­
perative to remember that there are many 
political and cultural factors operating. There 
are potentials existing within Islamic religious 
ideals which could provide a positive force. 
We should be careful that our attitudes, par­
ticularly as expressed in the media, do not 
contribute to a polarization of differences, to 
an entrenchment of defensiveness and hos­
tility. 
There are many Muslims on campus (more than the 20 estimated by Lobdell); I hope to see some responses to the issues raised by him and by myself. The Observer is an available forum to demonstrate the range of thought within the Islamic community.

South Africa 'harmless' compared to Soviets 
Dear Editor: 
A charming story came across the wire last week, and local papers picked it up. It seems our comrades in Russia are growing ill­humored these days with their pesky Mghan neighbors. And so they have done the only natural thing that they could do. 
Last year they systematically brutalized and dispatched off to eternity 35,000 Mghan civilians by means ofan imaginative variety of antics. These included pitching old folks out of helicopters and strewing the countrysides with booby-trapped children's toys which blow off faces and fingers and generally ruin a kid's day. 
Just lovely. Now mind you, this is from the documented findings of a disinterested U.N. commission. 
Also last week, on a (onege campus fixe<;! mid-west in the cosmos, a student body of overall unreflective young people, donning their political garb for a day and displaying the biceps of the democratic method, voted up a measure that would have the movers and the shakers oftheir college let loose their money­muscled grip on life in South Africa. After all, South Africa is a place where a travesty of justice goes by the name oflaw, a place where the modicum of peace, order and prosperity that they enjoy is but the trappings concealing poverty, corruption, racism and oppression, and a place where things are not nice. 
Student backing of that proposal un­doubtedly has brought some joy to some of the otherwise discomfited and malcontent professors at the same college. Up to then no one, not the administration, not the Board, had really been brought round to the fine idea

Calculus or Core class. And they will continue to be in your classes until both of you graduate. Ofcourse, there arc exceptions, but these are few and far between. 
What special intangible attracts people to Notre Dame and what magnetism keeps those people here for the span of their .college career? Is is that Notre Dame has a rich history or is it the mystique of the Golden Dome? Some may claim that it is the post-college op­portunities that bring potential students here. Other students fall in love with the campus -it becomes the deciding flctor for many. While Notre Dame certainly has a beautiful campus, it is not the only campus in the country with ivy or lakes. 
Anybody who is presently attending or has graduated from Notre Dame knows that it is not the materialistic things that are the attrac­tion, but rather it is the people and the spirit that make Notre Dame special. Most students could have gone, academically, to a com­parable school. I had the opportunity to at­tend Cornell University in New York. But Cornell lacked that special something; the stu­dents walked by without so much as a glance ora smile. 
The special feeling is a sense of belonging, the friendly atmosphere, the helpful students who care. People across the country see it at the football and basketball games on televi­sion: the comradery and spirit of the student sections. That feeling is not specific to the United States alone. Many students come here from abroad which in turn leads to a diverse student population comparable to none. This diversity allows for a more complete and rounded education. One can learn of foreign 

terrorism, violence 
Dear Editor: 

I am writing to comment upon the article about Islam included in the special feature about non-Catholics at Notre Dame. My own background is American Baptist (a non­fundamentalist branch not to be confused with Southern Baptist). I have a great interest in other religions, particularly Islam. 
Charles Lobdell's article began by noting the widespread equation of Islam with ter­rorism in the media. but then did not address

means; and some argue vehemenently against any tactic which knowingly takes innocent lives.Just as Christians are currently debating whether or not there is ever a justified war, so there is debate in Muslim circles about non­violent courses of action. I do not see this as a major trend right now, but it could be nurtured by open-mindedness, and could conversely be stifled by continued expres­sions ofstereotyping and contempt toward all Islamic society.

countries through personal experiences rat­her than textbooks. Even closer to home, one learns about the different cultures and heritages in other states or even in one's own home state. 
Notre Dame's blend of people and spirit is what makes Notre Dame the unique, special place that it is. It is true that probletns do exist here and that people have the right to voice their opinions about the school's policies and other assorted decisions among other things. Yet through all of the complaining and the problems, Notre Dame hasn't lost its glory or its prestige. Notre Dame is still a special place despite its problems. But you probably knew that to begin with.

Nazz alive and kickin' 

MARY JACOBY 
features editor 

Despite the less-than-crazy at­mosphere of the North Dining Hall, the annual Nazz Music Com­petition was a success Friday night as 14 acts played to a crowded house. 
"It was great; there was standing room only," Liz Keys, SAB musical entertainment committee assistant chairperson and the competition's director, said. 
Five winners were picked from the competition, and Saturday night was supposed to have been an encore performance for the win­ners. Two of the winners, however, had previous engagements, causing the encore to be postponed to a later date. 
Also, six students were selected at the competition to play with Max Weinberg, the drummer for Bruce Springsteen's band, the following weekend when he will make an ap­pearance at Stepan Center. 
Taking the first-place prize of $200 was the Pat Giblin Band, six seniors who play a mixture of original songs and late-60s rock. The audience repsonded en­thusiastically during the band's set, clearing away the tables to make room for dancing. 
The Pat Giblin Band, which has 
been playing together in local bars, consists of Mike Toner, lead vocals; Bill Leonard, guitarist; Scott Johnston, bass; and Chris Smolen, saxophone. Tom Barry, rhythm guitar; and a South Bend drummer known as Johnny. 
Second place and $150 went to the Bill, Bob and Biff Band, which played a mixture of folk and soft rock with covers by Crow by, Stills and Nash, and America. The band consists of Zahm Hall residents Mike McDermott, Jeff Sayre, and Noble Levasque. The Bill, Bob and Biff Band began last year when the members started singing in their hall bathrooms. When their music began sounding good, they decided to make the band public. 
Winning third place and $75 was Word of Mouth, a seven-member dance band formed in October, 1985. Word of Mouth is Chuck Amata, alto saxophone, Bill Merkel, bass; Mike Sharkey, guitar; Jim Tyler, vocals; John Berets ka, keyboards; Paul Loughridge, drums; and Kelly Har­rington, vocals. 
The judges awarded the fourth­place prize of $50 to Monarch, a band playing '70s rock and roll. Monarch consists of Peter Grenier, lead guitar; Tom Conforti, bass; Shawn Ryan, drums; and Ryan Powell, vocals and guitar. 
The 
The last prize awarded was $25 to T. Cross and the Trappers of Success, an eight-member pop band which performed original songs written by Terry Cross, the lead vocalist. Other members of the band are Joe Brady, drums; Chris Barnabo, keyboards; Ed Sheckler, tenor sax; Mike Myers, trumpet; Mike Peeney, bass; Andy Schlitz, guitar; and Mike Schrimpf, alto sax. 
The competition lasted until 2 a.m., much longer than the pro­jected 12 a.m. ending time. Judges were Jim Dolan, a member of the 
Notre Dame basketball team; Lee Broussard, SAB manager; Mike Switek, Notre Dame's new student body president; and John Van, a published songwriter and Notre Dame graduate student. Dennis Tillman served as emcee and Mike Varlotta and Mike Vore were in charge of sound. 
Selected to play with Weinberg were Ryan from Monarch, Smolen, Leonard and Toner from the Pat Giblin Band; Fred Cassel from the band Wicked Shed; Brian Burke and O'Keefe from Four Guys and Pete; and Mike Speranza, a solo act. Judges for the Weinberg com­petition were Ron Mileti, former SAB music entertainment commis­sioner; J.A. Lacy, current music ~ommissioner; and Don Seymour, WVFI music director. 
Although the competition did not take place in the Nazz this year, Keys decided to keep the original name because "upperclassmen will know what it is, even though it's not in the same place." The com­petition began later than usual this year, because organizers were waiting for Chautauqua to be finished. When no completion date was in sight, it was decided to hold the event in the North Dining Hall. The original Nazz, which has been remodeled in the LaFortune Center renovations, now contains no stage and is no longer being used for musical entertainment. 
"We tried to assimilate as much as possible," Keys said. And it was a success. "71/e really captured the spirit of the Nazz," Keys said.

 

I love spring at Notre Dame. After a long winter of hiberna­tion, students flock to the quads to frolic and bask in the Indiana sunshine. 
There are those who play Frisbee, those who practice lacrosse, those who play catch, and, of course, those who sunbathe. 
While enjoying the beauty of yesterday afternoon, I came across a notoriously appearance-conscious girl that many call Glamourous Pam. She was lying on a blanket in a two-piece bathing suit, reading Cosmopolitan magazine. Her heavily-oiled body glistened in the sunlight. · 
As I approached, Pam looked up from her magazine and squinted in my direction. 
"Hey, how was your break?" she asked me. A very original ques­tion. "Mine was great!" she said, before I had a chance to answer. "I went to Fort Lauderdale -the weather was fabulous. I caught some serious rays." 
I'd imagine there are more serious things you can catch in Fort Lauderdale. "I'm not kidding," she said. "The sun was absolutely brutal all 
week." I'm sorry to hear that you suffered. "No, it was great," Pam said. "I really made a lot of progress on 
my tan." What kind of progress? "Well, let me put it this way," she said. "I started spring break at 
SPF-12 and since then, I've dropped down to SPF-2." That's funny -it doesn't look like you've lost weight. "No, SPF stands for sun protection factor," said Pam. "It tells 
you the strength of suntan lotion. The higher the SPF of the lotion, 

the more of the sun's ultraviolet rays it blocks out. I'm using SPF­
2, which lets almost all of the sun's rays to pass through." 
Sort of like cooking oil. 
"Well, it allows me to obtain the deepest, darkest tan possible so 
I can look my very best." 
Sounds like you've been watching too many Coppertone com­
mercials, Pam. 
I glanced oyer the array of bottles and tubes lying near Glamourous Pam's blanket. It looked like she was preparing to do a chem lab experiment. There were three different bottles of sun­tan lotion, a jar of Blistex lip cream, a tube of nose block-out, and a bottle of baby oil. 
I picked up a tube of something called For Faces Only. 
"That's for your face," she said. 
thanks, Pam, i would've never guessed. Why do you need special suntan lotion for your face? 
"Where have you been?" she said. "Everyone who has ever spent time in the sun knows that your face tans differently than the rest of your body -that's why you need For Faces Only." Then she showed me a green bottle. 
"Do you know what this is?" she asked. 
Let me guess -For Kneecaps Only. 
"Don't be silly," she said. "It's lemon juice." 
Are you making mixed drinks out here? 
"No, you put lemon juice in your hair so it'll get lighter in the sun. I think lighter, blonder hair is more attractive." 
Well, if you're not careful where you rest your lemon juice­drenched head, a colony of ants just might find your hair attrac­tive, too. 
Pam's eyes widened as she sat up nervously, ran her fingers through her hair, and said, "Don't even say that in jest." 
Hey Pam, since when did sunbathing become so scientific, anyway? I mean, the earliest American settlers probably didn't worry about sun protection factors. I bet Davy Crockett never put lemon juice in his hair. 
"Well, I like to thing of tanning as an art," she said. "The sun is the artist and my body is the artwork." 
I suppose even Michelangelo had his bad days. Listen, why are you so obsessed with keeping that spring break tan? Don't you realize that you're in South Bend and it's only April? Inevitably, we're going to get hit with another giant snowstorm, the sun will be absent from the skies for weeks, and your beautiful tan will peel off like a snake's skin. 
"Well, I was watching Channel 16 Live at Five news," Pam said, "and Dick Addis assured us that we're going to have a beautiful spring." 
Like I was saying...

"Beuerlein showed good leadership and moved the ball well, and Terry threw very well today. Steve Belles had an awfully good day. He was a pleasant surprise." 
Belles, a freshman, moved his troops upfield in his first drive on passes to freshman tight end Andy Heck and sophomore split end Tony Eason. The drive was capped off with the final touchdown of the day on a 14-yard completion over the middle to Heck. Belles com­
pleted seven of his nine passes on 
the day, as did Andrysiak. 
Beuerlein connected on eight-of-12. 
Holtz contends that the offensive 
line will be one of the main areas to 
be looked at in the upcoming spring 
practices. 

"Our offensive line is going to 
hold the key to our success offen­
sively," he said. "The amount of 
pride and discipline they show will 
tell the story. That's what we're 
trying to bring out in them. 
"Our quarterbacks are going to 
play well and our receivers will 
definitely do the job. Tim Brown 
and Milt Jackson did some good 
things today. We know what a Tim 
Brown can do. We have a young, 
inexperienced backfield that is 
making some progress, but the line 
is the key to our offensive success." 
One bright spot for the Irish in 
the scrimmage was the kicking 
game. While there were no 
kickoffs or punts, junior field-goal 
kicker John Carney was perfect on 
the day. He connected on three ex­
tra points, added a 25-yard field 
goal, and booted a 46-yarder to end 
the scrimmage. Holding the ball on 
all five occasions was junior punter 
Dan Sorensen. John Grieb handled 
the snaps. 

Rushing yardage was evenly 
split, as quarterback Belles picked 
up 36 yards to lead the team. 
Taylor collected 22 yards, while 
freshmen Corny Southall and Mark
