Awindow in Father Hesburgh's office was 
broken late Wednesday night, April 18, or early the next morning. According to Hesburgh's secretary, both the storm window and the regular window were broken. Glass was shattered all over the office. Security does not know exactly when the incident occurred nor does it have any leads on the case. "Jt's (the case) is pending any further information that may be ofsubstantive nature," said Security Director Glenn Terry. Father Hesburgh was out ofthe country at the time. -The Observer

TheSenate has moved hardy an inch since Tuesday, when it first took up the three-year, 5144 billion deficit reducing package supported by Prt:sidcnt Reagan. Cuts in federal programs arc politi· cally scnsitivt: in a year in which one-third of the scats in the Senate arc up for grabs. Wilh some 38 amendments still pending, it seems likely the Senatl' will spend this emire week on the bill. The Reagan plan would kt defense grow each year by more than 7 percent above the ratl· of inflation. It would freeze most discretionary spending in l98'i and let it grow by the rate of inflation in 1986 and 1987. It would not touch Social Security and other guaranteed-payment bl·nd1t programs. The S 144 billion plan includes a S47 billion tax increasl· already approved. Debate this week likely will center on a bipartisan effort by St:ns. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., Joseph Bidcn, D-Dcl., ami Charles Grasslcy, R-lowa, to freeze all federal spending across the hoard for a year. Sponsors claim the measure would rl·dun· the dctkit about S23 billion more than the administration plan. -AP 
The United States secured a nuclear coopera­
tion agrn·mcnt with China on Monday, launching what President Reagan tcrml·d "a new dimension ofpeaceful cooperation" between the two nations. The president witnessed the initialling of a pact, three years in the making, that opens the door for the sale df U.S. nuckar energy sales to China. Before his departure for Shanghai and the last day of his China trip, Reagan said in remarks prepared for delivery at the signing ceremony in the Great Hall of the People, "Our agrct:ment is basl·d on our shart·d dt:sirc to prevent tht: proliferation of nuclear l'Xplosives in the world, and it brings a new dimt:nsion of pt:act:ful coopt:ration to our relationship." Although ditferenct:s over Taiwan cast a shadow over the president's visit, Reagan's last act in Peking was to sign accords ending a year-long chill in <:ultural rc:lations and averting double taxation for U.S. firms opl·rating in China. -AP

Final exams: Another issue to protest? 
Lately the campus has been in an uproar over the new 
alcohol policy. Notre Dame is absorbed in banners, 
firecrackers, sit-ins and rallies. Amid fiery protests and 
the rage over a "paternalistic" administration, another 
example of paternalism has been largely overlooked ­
the new final exam policy, passed on April 10 by the 
Academic Council. 

The passage of the exam policy just before the new rules on alcohol indicates a brilliant sense of timing. Surely if it hadn't been for the "double whammy" stu­dents would be putting up an energetic battle against the council's decision. As it is, exams have taken a back seat to alcohol. Students can no longer alford to ignore this additional example of administrative overbearing that will have so great an influence on their future workloads and grades. 
The exam policy was recommended by the Commit­tee on Final Examinations -a committee comprised of six faculty members and no students. A lack ofconcern for student input was also

portance of these and the incentive to do well. Heavily weighted finals will only aggravate problems for stu­dents who have exam-phobia, who "go blank" when they don't know the answer to the first question, who don't test well, or who simply are having a very bad day. From now on they will often be judged less on the ac­cumulated work ofa semester, which averages out over time, and more on a chancy, two-hour pressure test. One day should not have such an unbalanced influence on the evaluation of an entire semester, and many teachers, those who up to

Like the alcohol policy, the exam policy is hasty and flawed. Unlike the alcohol policy, which was developed over a long period of time to try to correct an ack­nowledged problem -alcoholism on campus -the ex­am policy did not arise out of a bad situation. It was formed within two months and contained few explana­tions for why it was needed. 
What was wrong with the old exam policy? What major problems did it cause? Were students or faculty objecting to it? None of the changes adopted seems to address a real problem, but each can cause great dif­ficulties for both students and faculty. 
The rationale given by the committee for the weight­ing change hegs the question: "Given the singular importance of final examinations, they ought to be allowed more weight in determining final grades." Why should policy dictate to teachers how important finals are? In many classes, papers and quizzes arc given often, and overweighting the final detracts from hoth the im-

well as job applications and 
worrying about where to 

live. Final exams will indeed be a heavy and unnecces­
sary burden. 
l11c justification for all these changes appears weak, if not nonexistent. Is Notre Dame simply trying to en­hance its academic prestige. in facile and ineffective ways, at the expense of fairness to students? There arc many better and less burdensome ways to do this, such as increasing faculty salaries or strengthen major re­quirements. 
According to Faculty Senate Chairman Mario Borelli, no review of the decision is possible. Student Body President Rob Bertino agreed that any appeal would be worthless. But the same was said of the alcohol directives, which are even now being revised. Students must at least examine the worth of the new policy which has been out of the limelight so far, and loullly make their opinions heard to an administration which would be much more comfortable making policy with­out the annoying objections ofits students.

Senior StaffReporter 
More than I00 hours of Shakespeare's plays have been read during the past week to raise money for Adam Milani, a high school senior critically injured in a hockey game on December 7. 
Milani is the son of accounting Professor Kenneth Milani and Joan Milani, Pre-Cana coordinator for Campus Ministry. He has been undergoing physical therapy at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago since the accident. 
Milani was injured in a hockey game against Culver Military Academy when he went after a puck and was knocked down against a ledge inside the rink. The impact crushed a vertebra in his neck, leaving him without movement from the chest down. 
Milani, a senior at St. joseph's High School, plans to attend Notre Dame next year. He has been named aNa­tional Merit Finalist, and a Notre 
Dame  Scholar.  Currently.  he  is  
finishing  one  course  he  needs  to  
graduate.  


Money raised by the Shakespeare marathon will be used to help pay for therapy, two wheelchairs; a modified van, and an addition to the first floor of the Milani house. 
In an interview with the South Bend Tribune in February, Milani said ''I'm working on things like brushing my own teeth, brushing my own hair ...mainly fine motor skills." He is also practicing using tools for writing and typing. 
The physical therapy lasts three hours a day, Professor Milani said, and emphasizes strength and balance. "He can now transfer him­self from his wheelchair to his bed," Milani said. 
"The Shakespeare reading is an outpouring of affection and love ... it would be impossible to thank everybody involved," Milani said. "We want to extend our apprecia­tion to everyone involved." 
Spinal cord research is still in its infancy, said Milani. "There is still hope that some of the techniques that will be perfected in the next few years will be ofbenefit to Adam," he said. "Along with the technology 
and techniques there is the Maker, also." 
Milani plans to live in St. Edward's Hall on campus next year, where his brother Michael lives. An advantage ofSt. Ed's, Milani said, is that renova­tions after the fire four years ago made most of the building acces­sible to handicapped people. 
Modifications, such as an 

automated front door, are still being 
proposed, said Milani. 
Money raised by the Shakespeare marathon will be put in the Adam Milani Fund to help pay for Milani's therapy and manual and electric wheelchairs. The electric wheel­chair will be used by Milani to go to classes. 
The money will also help buy a modified van with an extended roof and a lift for Milani's wheelchair, said Professor Milani. The van will even­tually be modified so his son can drive it. 
The Fund will also offset the cost ofan addition to the Milani house for Adam. 
Donations can be given to the Bet­hany Guild/Adam Milani Fund at Sacred Heart Parish. 
CILA to protest dining hall firings 
AMY STEPHAN 
AssistantNews Editor 
CILA will sponsor a protest of the allegedly unsubstantiated tiring of five dining hall workers last Novem­ber in front of North Dining Hall tomorrow. 
Fifty or 60 students are expected to picket and distribute fact sheets tomorrow during lunch hours, said Nancy Brennan, a CILA education of­ficer and co-organizer ofthe event. 
An organizational meeting for those interested in participating will be held tonight at 7:30 in the Center for Social Concerns. CILA also in­tends to invite interested dining hall workers to picket. said Brennan. 

Student awareness and education are the main goals of the display she said, adding the protest is intended to demonstrate solidarity with the fired workers. CILA is also drafting a letter to Father Theodore Hesburgh, University president, which they hope will encourage him to re­examine the issue, said Brennan. 
Two pantry workers and three managers were fired last November for their role in an alleged plot to ex­tort money from another worker. The pantry workers were accused of the actual extortion, while the

managers were fired because the dining hall administration claims they knew of the extortion and took no measures against it. 
But in a March 19 Obsener ar­ticle, William Hedl, a University security investigator assigned to the case, said there was "no evidence of any wrongdoing" on the part of the pantry workers and security "was not involved at all" in examining the role ofthe three managers. 
There are court cases pending against the University because of these firings, Brennan said. Ron At­hey, assistant director of Notre Dame Food Services refused to con­firm or deny this. 
Brennan said the protest is in­tended to "expose the injustice to the people in the dining hall," claim­ing they were denied rights guaranteed by the University. The official employees relations hand­book of Notre Dame states all workers are entitled to an oral warn­ing, a written warning and a suspen­sion before being fired. 
"The issue has been lagging," said Brennan. CILA tried to organize a discussion group on the issue, but had difficulty convincing untenured faculty members to participate, she said. 
Brennan does not foresee any 

conflicts over the demonstration. 
"We're not going to storm the dining 
hall," she said. 
Tomorrow was chosen for the protest because it is International Worker's Day, Brennan said. Fifty­one years ago tomorrow Dorothy Day distributed the first copies of The Catholic Worker in Washington Square in New York City. 
William Hickey, director of Notre Dame Food Services was not ap­proached for comment because he is recovering from a heart attack suf­fered last week.

My wift", Gt"nk, and I vbited the plan· and. of course, noticed the large statue of Jesus in the "sacred heart" motifstanding by tht· entrance way. 
Just across tht" hall was a poster on the wall which read "God bless America" with a

Guest column 
picture of the American flag. As we accom­
panied our son to his room on his first day, we 
passed a room full of children plt.-dging al­
kgit'ncc to the !lag of the llnitcd States. 
That is how it all starts -pledging al­kgicncc to a fordgn power. A power foreign to Christians is no less than an idol. Pledging allcgience includes obeying orders. if and wht·n givt"n, to kill thost" dcsignatt·d enemies. I know, ti>r I took such an oath contrary to the teachings ofJesus (:\it. "i:.3."') when I st·rvcd in tht" military both a~ an t·nlisted person and as an officer. 
But I had an t·xcu~t· then. I did not know about the tt·achings of .Jt·sus prohibiting the ust· of vioknce by his ti>llowcrs, although I was raised in tht· Church. 
The basis ofChristian refusal to honor such a st·rious secular command is not found in the rationak usually assunll'd by fellow Christian militarists. The Christian docs not nt:ccssarily believe that the AmtTican military t·stablish­mcnt "promotes or ti>stcrs war." Although today, American "first strike" weaponry and Ct·ntral American adventurism suggests just that. The Christian docs not ignore Russian txpansionism or "the evils of Soviet socialism," nor is the Christian unaware oftht· 
"protection" militarism claims to provide. 
For Christians, tht· point is much deeper. Reserve Officers' Training Corps Catholic campuses in the same way abortion clinics or dt-ctric chairs do not belong on Catholic campuses. This is ht-causc to kill one's enemy ratht·r th:m to love one's t·nemy is to sin against God and his son's teaching, practice and Vt:f\' lit<:. 
At best, ROTC is, in tradi<ional Catholic ter­minology, an "occasion ofsin." I was tempted hy that occasion at age 12 when I first joined ROTC at Admiral Farragut Military Academy. It is the occasion to think oneself ht:ttcr than 
others even to the extent of taking another's 
life if ordered. Christians should not seck 
military protection against enemies, for Christ 
is our protection -not bombs or bullets! 
When I taught at Villanova University in the religion department in 1979 and 1980, the issue ofROTC was examined in the University newspaper, The Villanovmz, over several weeks. During the course ofthe debate, a dear friend of mine, Father Richard McSorley, a professor of theology at Georgetown wrote to The Villam)llan that "ROTC on a Catholic campus is a scandal in the deepest theological scnst" of the word. Namely, under the guise of good -humanizing the military -we ed­ucate youth to kill and destroy." 
It is irrelevant that we arc threatened by communists. i'or our security lies not in the military of any nation hut in the Kingdom of God. If we wish to live in the Kingdom, we must return good for evil, not resisting the evildoer with violt.-nce and war, even in our own defense, but with active love ( Mt. "i:38­48 ). Jesus killed no one but was killed (as were Gandhi and King). No-legalistic proof­tcxting will alter the truth that to be a Catholic Christian means to live a radically different life than the one the military calls us to live. 
I do not condemn anyone in the military. I 
once was there and did "good" things during 
my tour of duty. fortunately. I was not or­
dt:rcd to kill anyone. My beliefs arc not a 
criticism ofindividual militarists -we cannot 
judge their hearts, but we can judge such ac­
tions by the Gospel. In a way, we arc called to 
choose between "services" -the service of 
war-making and the service ofpeacemaking. 
If there is indeed an anti-military attitude at Notre Dame concluding "that military service is incongruous with good Christian living" (The Obsen,er, Hamilton, March 12, 1984, p. 6 ). then I say, as a former teacher of theology at Notre Dame, that the service ofpeace is not incongruous with good Christian living. 
Those who teach otherwise on our Catholic campuses must keep in mind the words of Jesus concerning the teaching of young people (who may well be the future innocent victims ofour nuclear holocaust inclinations): "whot·ver causes one of these little ones who believe in mt: to sin, it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened round his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea." ( Mt. 18:6).

DearEditor: 

It is with relief and hope that I receive the llniversity's new policy concerning alcohol and ND students' social life. My reliefthat mar­ginal social interaction has finally been overcome by the solution oflimiting the num­ber ofpeople in a room spurns new hope that the administration will strike at the heart of the problem: alumni drinking at tailgaters before football games. Hao;n't the proper ex­ample set by Stephen Rcn and Mark Kirasich from the class of 1982 been learned? 
The sooner this across-the-board policy is implemented, the quicker the University can hold its head high. Let's not put our sense of right on hold during certain football weekends or is the pen that signs the donation checks mightier than the wrong of having three people in a single room? 
job change in order.

Rector bans banners 
DearEditor: 
We, as members of Saint Edward's Hall, would like to show our support for the stu­dent body's efforts by openly displaying our disapproval of the administration's alcohol policy. llnfortunately, due to a statute set forth by our rector, we arc not allowed to hang banners of any kind from our windows. Therefore, we are not able to comply with Stu­dent Body President Rob Bertino's request that a banner hang out of every dormitory window.

Reagan is the great escape artist 
W ASIIINGTON -Harry Houdini, the Great Escape artist, has been upstaged by Ronald Reagan. Houdini -at least in the movie I saw -went into a river encased in something like a safe, his hands cuffed behind him. Moments later, he emergt:d.

anyway and popped up in China. Welcome the Great Rondini. 
Reagan has become the Great Escape artist ofour times. He has two bask tricks. The first is your basic now-you-see-him, now-you­don't maneuver. The President brought down the house with that one when he finally or­dered the Marines withdrawn from Beirut. 
The audience, knowing that the Great Ron­dini had said that he was not going to be pushed around by terrorists, thought they were watching intently. But suddenly the Marines were gone. And so was the Great Ron­dini. He popped up in Santa Barbara. When he returned to Washington, it was as if nothing had happened. 
The President pulled off the same trick again recently. When it was reported in the press that the CIA had directed the mining of ' three Nicaraguan harbors, Congress voted its indignation -and also failed to vote the funds the President wanted for El Salvador. The Great Rondini did his number. He dispatched the money anyway -and then siipped out of town. When last seen, he was walking around China. 
The second trick ofthe Great Rondini is his ability to make everyone forget. It is often said that the Great Rondini himselfis forgetful, but if that is the case he ha~ turned his personal affliction into an epidemic. The Great Rondini campaigned, after all, on a platform of balanc­ing the budget. He actually lambasted Jimmy Carter for running up a S29 billion deficit. This year, the budget deficit is expected to be 
S200 billion, but the Great Rondini has made 
everyone forget what he said in the campaign. Similarly, the administration of the Great Rondini has again declared a war against state-
sponsored terrorism. This news was greeted with great excitement a couple of weeks ago by some newspaper editors who placed the story on the front page. 
The Great Rondini madt: them forget. A war against terrorism was declared when the ad­ministration first took office. In fact, it wa~ made the number one priority. The war was declared again after both the American Em­bassy and the Marine barracks were bombed in Beirut and now it has been declared one more time. 
Remember school prayer? The Great Ron­dini ha~ made us forget that also. For weeks, the issue tied up Congress, had lawmakers at each other's throats, had the President talking about God being banned from the schools and the country slipping into irreversible and pos­sibly terminaL moral decay. Now no one, lea~t of all the Great Rondini, mentions it. He is on to other matters. 
The list of things the Great Rondini ha~ made us forget is long. It inciudes the basis for his economic and tax program, which at one time was investment-based, then consumer­based and then turned out to be a variation of that old Democratic standby, Keynesian economics -a recovery fueled hy mao;sive deficit spending. 
It includes even Lebanon, which at one time was the keystone of the entire Middle East, and which, if it fell would topple dominoes down to Saudi Arabia Suddenly, though, Lebanon is not that important anymore and Saudi Arabia -as opposed to American foreign policy -stands tall. 
The Great Rondini apparently learned I1is tricks back in his days as a motion-pit:turt: and television actor. What matters is the establish­ment of character -not continuity from either picture to picture or episode to episode. And the President ha~ certainly es­tablished his character. 
It is one Americans seem to like, even love. Being a ma~terful magician, the President keeps our eyes on him and not what he docs. Call it sleight of policy. 
And so now the Great Rondini is now performing in China. By the time he returns, Congress will have forgotten it is angry with him over Central America. But even if it still is, the Great Rondini will distract it. Maybe he'll declare war on terrorism.

Showcase 
Memories or disillusionment? 
by Chris Fraser 
features columnist 
I 
remember when I was a new freshman nearly four years ago, a 
senior in my hall took a bunch of us out to buy some beer. More 
precisely, he went into the liquor store while we waited eagerly in 
his car. Upon our return to campus, the seniorwarned us to be care­
ful because we might get in trouble ifcaught brnging in cases of 
Lager. As green as we were, we slyly scampered in, carefully check­
ing each corner for RAs and rectors on the prowL 
Well it was just a few days before we understood that the wool had 
been pulled overourfreshmen eyes, and that, in fact, we could bring 
in as much alcohol as we wanted so long as we did not attempt to 
consume it in the hallways. 
Even so, we were certain that the administration was too restrictive and paternalistic. We were distraught because we couldn't have kegs and many of us were surprised by the concept of parietals. But one thing we were was optimistic. We thought things would change for the better; we believed some ofthe rules would fade as Notre Dame entered the 80s. 
Little did we suspect a day would come when a beer run might well have to be a clandestine operation, a day when students would be told what they could and could not do during spring break in Ft. Lauderdale. 
I tell this story not to make another passionate argument about why the administration's new alcohol policy is a mistake (although I could make several)but rather to point out what a friend ofmine calls the dilemma ofNotre Dame. 
The dilemma ofNotre Dame is something seniors begin to face as graduation nears. On one hand, we may have begun to look at our school nostalgically. We remember the many good times we've had and the many close friends we've made. We want to look at our col­lege days as a fun and exciting period. We want to call the Fighting Irish our team from our great school. 
On the other hand, the administration certainly forces many of.us to leave with a bad taste in our mouth. And sadly, the new alcohol policy is only representative ofthe problem. At a time when social life is approaching a low, we have seen the administration re-issue a demand for harsh punishments for parietals violations. Ofcourse, this does nothing to prevent the clever couple from spending the night together but it surely does stop a co-ed study session or a round ofTrivial Pursuit from extendingbeyond the bewitchnghour. As well, we have seen any hope for co-ed dorms -a responsible solution to many ofthe real social problems on campus-fade into oblivion. 
We see that women are still treated as second-class citizens, ad­mitted on a limited basis. More than a few ofus have seen our favorite professor denied tenor and forced to move on --sometimes for questionable reasons. And above all, we have constantly sensed an administration's attitude toward us that suggests we are incapable ofdealing with the world, that we must be sheltered, protected, and, when necessary, punished. Such treatment can bring advantages: we would often rather deal with the administration than with the South Bend police and few ofus haye complained about receiving maid or 
laundry service. But finally, it is a degradingand insultingattitude to 
take toward college students. 
The dilemma, then, is one ofmemories versus disillusionment. A look at past graduates tells us that the memorieswill be embellished and the disillusionment will fade. We want to come back and enjoy the football games and see our old friends. Problems with student life and administration attitudes will no longer affect us. And so we will come back with green pants, visit our old rooms and tell the stu­dents how good they have it. We will laugh about the tricks we used to sidestep keg or parietal rules and we may even encourage our kids to follow us here at Notre Dame. 
The University understands all this and they have wasted no time in asking the seniors for their first alumni contributions which are necessary in order to receive any football tickets. And many ofus will give because we want to see our friends and remember the good times. And in doing so we will provide the lifeblood for the perpetua­tion of the University's attitude toward the students. As the years go by, the dilemma becomes less diffcult to confront: we remember less and give more. 
Unfortunately. forgetting one ofthe horns does not really resolve the dilemma. I believe it is important for us to make our decision about contributing responsibly, on the basis ofhow we feel the Uni­versity is educating, and not merely to get football tickets. It would be juvenile not to give simply because we disagree with an alcohol policy but it is our only recourse not to give if we see evidence ofa widespread administrative attitude that conflicts with our idea ofa university. 
It is a matter that each senior must decide for him or herselfand it is something that should be given some serious thought. 
I would like to thank anyone who basgiven my columns a bitof attention over the past two years. I wish all the seniors the best of luck in the future.

Owing up to an age-old cri111e 
by Keith Picher 
features staff writer 
T
hirty-two years after capturing a 
four-foot bronze statue ofNotre 
Dame founder Father Edward Sorin 
and hiding it for a semester, two 
pranksters have finally admitted to 
the crime, prompted by a recent ar­
ticle in Notre Dame Magazine. 
The mastermind, Chamillus Witzleben '53, decided to pull off the caper on a frigid moonlit night just prior to Christmas vacation in 1952. A former resident ofAlumni Hall, Witzleben is now ChiefofPat­hology at Children's Hospital in Philidelphia and a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. 
Witzleben was on his way to the post office (now the Knights of Columbus building) to mail some Christmas cards when he spotted the 1905 Biondi masterpiece sitting on the steps of the building. 
His accomplice, Edward Manier '53, was studying physical chemistry at his desk in 384 Dillon when a half­eaten piece offruit hit his window screen. Manier, now a professor in Notre Dame's philosophy depart· ment, loqked out his window and spotted Witzleben on the walkway below. 
The two decided to hide the statue, with hopes ofblaming the deed on the men from Walsh. They buried Sorin in a sand trap on the Burke Memorial GolfCourse since it was the easiest place to dig in December. 
During Christmas vacation, Manier ran into an old high school friend who was headed for Korea. He told him to send a telegram to the Prefect ofDiscipline, Father "Black Mac" McCarragher, now a resident ofCorby Hall. A few weeks later Father McCarragher got a telegram from Tokyo. "Dear Mac. Happened to be passing through Tokyo and stopped offto pay my respects to the Emperor. Say hello to the lads. Father Sorin." 
Other friends were told to send telegrams and postcards from Europe. One day McCarragher received a message from London. "Dear Mac. Represented the lads at the coronation ofElizabeth II. Oh to be in England now that spring is here." From Rome came another note. "Dear Mac. Had an audience with His Holiness today. I think I got things locked up for the new library. Don't let any ofthose young upstarts back there take the credit." 
For months the bronze Sorin hibernated in the bunker at Burke, and McCarragher was not amused. The two made sure that copiesofthe telegrams and postcards were sent to the South Bend Tribune, which quickly picked up the story and asked McCarragher for an interview. 

McCarragher did not mince his words. "We think thiswhole thing is 
the product of a diseased mind, or 
minds." 

A larger statue of Father Sorin, also by Biondi, which has never left its proper place overlooking South Quad. 
"It was serious in the sense that it was a statue we all venerated, but it certainly wasn't the most important thing on my mind at the time," recalls McCarragher. He does not remember having met Witzleben, and says he was not too well ac­quainted with Manier until he joined the Notre Dame faculty several years later. · 
Spring arrived and the pranksters decided it was time to dig up the statue. Fearing that someone would hit the figure on an explosion shot or that the statue would be uncovered when the golf team relocated the sand traps, Sorin was exhumed on a dark and stormy night. 
William Santoro '53, now a psyc­hiatrist in Beverly Hills, offered the use of his car. They dumped the statue in the trunk and headed for Homewood, IlL to drop Sorin off at Manier's girlfriend's house. Her father agreed to store the statue in the garage. He too was a jokester who had stolen the famous axe which the Stanford and California football teams awarded to each year's victor. 
Just before finals week the three decided to return Sorin to the campus. After bringing the statue back to South Bend on a bus, they hid it in a locker at the station. 
They sent one last telegram from Washington D.C. announcing Father Sorin's triumphant return prior to graduation. "We planned a Friday night bash, to avoid the crowd of parentson the weekend. There were only 500 in our senior class, and everyone else had gone home. Come Friday and everyone was at the Dunes. Including Carnie (Witzleben) and Zulu (Santoro)," says Manier. 
Manier went back to campus and waited for Witzleben and Santoro to return from the Dunes. They didn't. At about 11 p.m. Manier began to panic. He got a classmate to give him a lift out to the bus station, quickly snatched the statue from the bus sta­tion locker, and put it into the car's trunk. 
The duo avoided the crowd at the Main Circle and hid behind the engineering building a few minutes after midnight. They wrapped the statue in the same blanket in which they had hidden it months before and sneaked it past the Law School and behind the crowd at the Main Circle, whose attention was fixed on Notre Dame Avenue. 
"We snuck to within 100 yards, put the statue down, screamed a primal scream-HEYSOR1N-and ran, fearful for both our diplomas and our immortal souls." They blitzed away from the crowd and were never caught. 
"Ouronly goal was to bring happi­ness and laughter to a dry and humorless campus," says Manier. "We gained a profound sense of the ludicrousness oflife at Notre Dame, and that sense, which has deepened with age, has been our only reward until now."

Pillow talk? 


A timid start and a serf frivolous and frolicsor I 
ByJENNIFER BIGOTT 
Senior StaffReporter 
An Tostal, which means "spring festival" in Gaelic, continued its il­lustrious tradition at Notre Dame last week, judging from the overwhelming amount of participa· tion by the students. 
Timid Tuesday's golf tournament teed oil .a week-long celebration of springtime on the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's campuses. The golf out­ing took place on the Burke Memorial course. 
Evems such as the Slam Dunk Contest and Air Band competition highlighted Wicked Wednesday's activities. The Det·athalon, with such events as the dining hall tray run and the "Simon Says" contest, made the sunny afternoon seem all the more enjoyable. Commented Engineering major Greg Brehm, "I liked the Slam Dunk Contest be· cause I took second place." 
As the week progressed, so did the number of An Tostal events. On Thirsty Thursday, students from both campuses flocked to Saint Mary's for such events as the Tricycle Race, Twister, Jail, Dorm Feud and the ever-popular Mr. Campus contest. This year's winner was Mr. Zahm, Tom Fanning. "Mr. Campus" was one of the more popular events of the day, according to Grace Hall resident.Jell" Griffin. '"It was pretty fun. I liked seeing (Mr. Grace) Leo Gomez make a fool of himselfon stage," ht· commented. 
Tertia Carrigan, a McCandless freshman, cited Jail as one of her least favorite events. "I nearly got hit by a couple of pies because guys kept throwing me in jail," she said. 
Frivolous Friday lived up ro its name with its scheduled 1 H event~. The South Quad ti..·aturcd such events as the Jello and Egg Tosst·s. the Bucket Brigade, the Licorice Eating Contest and the Tire Roll, while Green Field hosted the Mattress Race and the Keg Toss. Among the most popular events in front of the Sorin statue were the Serf Auction. the Loudmouth Con­test, and the Trivia Bowl, won by Cavanaugh Hall. Friday night's Recess I 0 I and the midnight movie, 
"Polyester," brought the busy day to an appropriate close. 
Some students, however, were disappointed with tht. film, which

featured a revolutionary new con· cept in moviemaking, scratch and sniff, as well as a 200-plus pound transvestite, Divine. as the star. Viewers were given cards with ten numbered scratch J.nd sniff circles. When a number flashed on the screen. the appropriate circles were scratched and sniffed. "I thought it was stupid," said sophomore Lisa Fitt. "I think the idea ofa scratch and sniff movie was okay, but the movie was horrible. The smells were gross." The smells on the cards in­cluded skunk, stove gas and body odor. "Thank goodness there was no 
charge," commented one student. 
"Sunny Saturday" proved to be the perfect name for a near-perfect day. The warm weather and the positive attitude of the par,icipants made this day one to be entered 
among the best in the annals of An Tostal history. The picnic and the Mud Pit Games attracted the most students for the entire festival. Rob Riebsemleger, who organized the Mud Pillow Fights, said he was "surprised at so much participation. Registration was at the site and we were unsure of how many we were going to get. But we ended up having to tum teams away." 
The annual chariot race was won by Cavanaugh Hall for the second year in a row. 
The traditional Irish Wake closed Saturday's "An Tostal" events. The event was touted as "A Victory Dance at Stepan." Famous Chicago band Arien provided the music for the party, which lasted until after 2 the next morning. 
Bookstore Basketball was the final event ofAn Tostal, with Macri's Deli taking first place for the second year in a row in the men's division. The well-attended game took place be· hind the ACC late yesterday after­noon. 
Organization for the festival was left to the students, who did an ex· cdlent job, looking at the success of many of the events. "We got all the material we needed. It went well," said John Finnerty, who organized the jail event at Saint Mary's. 
Freshman Pomi Smith ofMcCand· less summed up the overall senti· ment of the week when she commented, "I loved the whole thing. There were so many different events. It really gave students the opportunity to get involved and meet one another. I can't wait until next year!"

Blumb says the last three weeks 
have been very hectic for him, and 
he was happy when the champion­
ship game finally was underway. 
"More than anything, I'm glad it's over," Blumb admitted. "It was fun doing it (running the tournament), but it's been long and wearing. The payoff was the game today (Sunday)."

Teamwork prevails as Macri's Deli repeats as Bookstore champions 
By PHIL WOLF 
Spurts Writer 
It was teamwork that did it last year, and it was teamwork that did it a~ain this year. 
Macri's lkli downed Tequila White Li~htning IV, 21-12, yester­day, in tht· rematch oflast year's final to become Bookstore Basketball Champion for the second strai~ht year. 
Macri's Deli once again exhibited the exn~lknt tt·amwork that kd the team to the Bookstore XII Cham­pionship last year. In that game, Macri's Prc:fc:rrc:d Stock defeated the favored Tequila White Lightnin~. 21-1 S. 
Tht· two teams took to the Bookswre-size 1:ourt painted in the ACC parking lot yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m. with introduetions by Jack I.loyd, ACC basketball announcer. 
Brian Enri~ht, whose nine fouls in the final ~ame helped to to convince the Bookstore commissioners to give him the Golden Hatchet Award for the: tournament, put Tequila White Li~tning IV on the hit two jump shots and a driving layup to go three-for-four in the fir~t half. He finished the game at three­for-eight. 

Both teams continued to have trouble finding the hoop in the first half, more because oflousy shooting than pressure from the zone defenses employed by the two teams. Neither team was able to build a lead of more than one point. as Macri's Deli answered every point Tequila scored until the game was tied at four. 
It was Joe Sweeney who tied the game at that point with an I H-foot jump shot from the left side of the court. Macri's then came quickly up court followng a Cunningham steal, and Sweeney scored on the fast break. The S-4 lead was Macri's Deli's first of the game, and Tequila White Lightning IV never led again. 
Macri's could not widen the mar­gin to two until another fast break gave the team two quick baskets. Steve Toohill hit a layup with an as­sist from Cunningham, who then came up with another steal. Larry Cuculic scored the rebound goal on

scoreboard first with a jump shot on which he also drew a foul. The score remained at 1-0 for several minutes, as both u·ams shot poorly every time down the court. 
Buhha Cunnin~am finally was able to tie tht· game at one with his first point of the ~ame, about which announcer I.loyd commented, "Cunningham has now matched his season avt·rage." 
However, tht· assist leader for Macri's showed that he also can score when ht· wants to. Cunnin­gflam was the only scorer for his team in the opening minutes, as he the break, givng Macri's the I0-8 lead. Cuculic, the tournament MVP, grabbed nine more rebounds in the game to lead both teams in that category. 

Steve Beuerlein scored on a 20­foot jumper from the right side for Tequila, but Macri's still held a two­point advantage at halftime, I 1-9. 
Macri's really started to roll in the second half, though, and the score was 14-9 before Tequila White Li~tning IV caught its breath.
