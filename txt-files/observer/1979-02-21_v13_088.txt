News in brief 
Police strike cancels Mardi Gras festivities 
NEW ORlEANS [AP] -Slllnsors canceled all remaining Mardi Gr~ and Carnival paradt.s/esterday citing a four-day police strike that has already dulle the traditional midwinter festival. Captains of the private social ''krewes'' or crews that sponsor the parades said: "We are not going to let Mardi Gras be held hostage by the· Teamsters." The police are members of Teamsters Local 253. Mardi Gras is a $50 million industry in New Orleans. Police union· spokesmen have called the festival "our four aces" in seeking to wring concessions trom the city. 

Utah House votes to allow media to witness executions 
SALTLAKE CiiY [AP]-The Utah House has voted to allow up to nine reporters to witness criminal executions. State law currently bars the media from watching a death sentence carried out. The measure, which passed the House 40-29 Monday, now goes to the Senate. It would ban cameras and recording equipment until after an execution has been completed and the body has been removed. Backers said allowing the media to witness an execution would increase the chances for accuracy and fairness. They also argued the deterrent value of capital punishment could not be effective without some news coverage of an execution. 
Meany refuses to quit; plan~ coporate price watch 
BAL HARBOR, Fla. [AP]-AFL-CIO President George Meany brushed aside suggestions that he retire and announced yesterday that he is mobilizing federation members to blow the whistle on companies that exceed President Carter's anti­inflation price guidelines. Meany also vowed to continue to criticize Carter's policies when o~ganized labor disagrees with them. He denied his attacks signity a break with the president and said he and Carter had a pleasant conversation Monday. "I think he (Carter) makes some mistakes and, frankly, I will continue to comment on those mistakes," Meany said, adding, ''The president doesn't seem to be upset about it.'' Meany sa.td he had promised to help monitor violations of the price guidelines. Meany said Carter had called the labor leader to ask for the federation's help, and that Carter thought the AFL-OO's plan to create a national price watchdog network was "very good.''

Mardi Gras gambling receipts top previous revenue records 
by]ohn Calcutt Executive Editor 

The 1979 Mardi Gras celebration closed Sarurday night, and Chair­man John McAustin reported that this year's gambling re­venues totalled approximately $33,000,$700 more than last year. 
"It's been a long half a year of preparation, McAustin ~omment­ed, "and I'm glad tt was a success. " 
In addition to carnival revenues, $21 000 in revenues were raised for Notre Dame charities through raffle ticket sales. Students won both drawings this year. Bart Nagy was awarded the grand proze Olds Cutlass Supreme and the Seller's drawing winner was Scott Sowell, who received an Olds Starfrre SX. 
Dillon and McCandless received a $50 award for the booth which raised the most money as their income totalled $3968 for the week. Holy Cross (ND) and Alumni-LeMans finished second and . third respectively; both booths raised over $3000. 
Other booths receiving awards were as follows: Best Booth--Morrissey-Holy Cross (SMq, Street Scene from Pygmalion; Theme--Grace­Lewis, Dante's Inferno; Struc­rure--Alwnni-Lemans, Pirate Ship from Peter Pan; Design-­Fisher-Augusta, Windmill from Don Quixote; Artwork--Stanford­Breen Phillips, Wizard of Oz; Special Effects--Holy Cross (ND), Mark Twain Riverboat; Original­ity--Keenan, Treasure Chest from Treasure Island; Committee Award--Zahm, Walsh, Papillon.

demonstration,'' Portman con­ceded. "If the university goes ahead and confiscates ID' s (in resJ;><>nse to a proposed 'break par1etals night'), that's a slap in their (students') faces. 
''When they ignore us, that shows that there is no two-way relationship (between students and the Administration)," con­cluded Portman. 
Roche discounted Heaney's pro­posed letter-writing campaign to Board of Trustees members in protest of the parietals situation, remarking, "To try to use the Board of Trustees would be useless--if there's anyone more adamant about parietals than Hesbur h, it's them.'' 
"We have to explore different avenues (in dealing with the parietals problem)," Roche con­cluded, "but we don't want anyone to get thrown out of school.'' 

All three candidates endorsed a constitutional amendment that would place a voting representa­tive for off-campus students on the student government Board of Commissioners. Heaney stressed that the representative should have full voting privileges while Portman emphasized that the present off-campus commit­tee Is "insufficient to meet the needs of 1500 off-cameus stu­dents.'' Roche, meanwhile advo­cated the hiring of a full-time Off-Campus Director to handle 0-C affarrs. 
The candidates expressed sup­port for a boycott of Nestle's products in protest against al­leged improper pricing and dis­tribution policies of the company in Third World countries. 
Roche also responded to ques­tions about the apparent exces­sive of records at the bookstore, commenting, "Records aren't the only thing overpriced at the bookstore. Everyday items are tremendously overpnced. '' 
He cited some examples of excessive pricing, pointing to a bottle of 50 Bayer aspirin that sells for $1.14 in the bookstore. "At Ayr-Way, that same bottle costs 47 cents--that's a difference of 142 percent," Roche ex­

of besting yet another one of his own records with a strong per­formance in the NCAA's. 
Yet DiSabato realizes that a repeat of last season's NCAA performance will be difficult. 
"Whether I'm at 126 or 134 the competition will be very tough,'' concedes DiSabato. ''The quality and talent are the same at both weights -you're never going to have an easy match. It will take two strong wins to make it to the regional finals, and n~dless to say it'll be even tougher after that." 
DiSabato's biggest competition will probably come from Neva~­Las Vegas' Tyrone Rose, a seruor wh<. finished seventh at last year's NCAA finals. Bi!ly Fitz­gibbons, a Cal-Poly seruor who was third in last year's Western Regional, and Paul Feliz, an Air Force junior who was third in the Midwest Regional in 1978, could also figure at 134. 
DiSabato sees himself as seeded probably second or third in the tournament. "They take previous finishes, national rank­mg. and individual records into account when seeding, so I should get a fairly good seed. If I'm seeded I probably won't have to face another seed until the second round, so that will give me a chance to get prepared.'' 
If the preparatton DiSabato has had already this season is any indication, then he should be more than ready for this year's NCAA tournament.
