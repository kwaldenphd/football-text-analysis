Like Sadat 

Mubarak pledges to pursue peace 
CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -President Hosni Mubarak pledged in an emo­tional inaugural address yesterday to pursue Anwar Sadat's search for Mideast peace hand in hand with the United States and to unsheath the "sword of law" to punish Egyptians who turn to violence. 
Paratroopers with rifles ringed the Egyptian Parliament building and guarded a hall near the rostrum where Mubarak spoke in case of an attack by assassins like the ones who killed Sadat last week. 
Mubarak, Sadat's hand-picked suc­cessor, took the oath ofoffice before the former interim president, Sufi Abu-Taleb, the 392-member Peoples' Assembly, foreign ambas­S<jdors based here and Moslem and Christian leaders. 
In tears as he eulogized Sadat, Mubarak said Egypt will honor the Camp David accords with Israel and that the Reagan administration will continue as a "full partner" in the search for Mideast peace. 
At his side was Sudanese President Gaafar Nimciri, one of the few Mos­lem leaders to support Sadat after he made peace wih Israel. 
Egyptian Interior Minister Nabawi Ismail said Mubarak received 9,567,504 votes in Tuesday's referendum, with 149,650 voting against him for a 98.46 percent plurality. 
Referring to the Moslem fun­damentalist army lieutenant and three civilians accused of gunning down Sadat at the Oct. 6 parade marking the 1973 Arab-Israeli. war, Ismail called the vote a denunciation of"extremism and terrorism." 
Mubarak said Egypt would honor all its international treaties and asked other nations to honor their commitments to Egypt. 
"Camp David, and the peace with Israel, will continue in all its letter and commitment,"he said. "We shall continue the autonomy negotiations (for Palestinians in Israeli-occupied lands) to put the Palestinians on the beginning of the road to get their lawful rights." . 
He said Egypt's position on the peace process would remain the same even after Israel turns over to Egypt the last third of the occupied Sinai Peninsula next April, and that

The first undergraduate residencehalls 
to be built at the University of Notre Dame in more than a decade will be dedicated on Nov. 13-14. The halls -Pasquerilla West, finished in lastjanuary, and Pasquerilla East, completed in May-are the result ofa $7 million gift from a johnstown, Pa., developer, Frank 
J. Pasquerilla. The gift from Pasquerilla, president and chairman of the board ofCrown American Corporation, was the eighth largest in American higher education in 1980 and is the largest ever to Notre Dame from a living person. The last residence hall dedicated on campus was high-rise Flanner Tower in 1969. -The Observer 
A sixth worker died yesterday from burns suffered from an explosion and fire in a chemical container that had recently been shut down for maintenance at a Dow Chemical USA plant in Texas. Five workers were killed in the blast and fire Tuesday night. The sixth employee, Glenn Savant, 29, of Lake jackson, died yester­day morning after having been transferred by helicopter to Hous­ton's Hermann Hospital with burns over 90 percent of his body. Two other employees and four contract workers who were repairing equipment at the plant were injured. Dow Chemical officials said the explosion was sparked in an outlet line at the bottom of a container separating raw materials used to manufacture polyethylene, a resin for making lightweight plastics and films. -AP 

Former Indiana Rep. John Brademas 
took the opportunity of his inauguration as New York University's 
13th president yesterday to blast the Reagan administration's cut­
backs in student aid as a threat to the nation's future. Noting he had 
spent 22 years as a congressman from Indiana writing many educa­
tion bills, Brademas said cutbacks in federal student assistant 
programs "threaten to bar the door to hundreds of thousands of 
young people who seek a·college education." Brademas served II 
terms in Congress from Indiana's 3rd District before Rep. John Hiler, 
R-Ind., defeated him last year. Brademas said students at NYU alone 
received more than $50 million through federal programs in the last 
academic year, including the guaranteed student loan system. "What 
i~ especially curious to me, as one whose entire adult life was spent 
in making national policy, is that the proposed cutbacks threaten 
goals the administration itself deems important," the new president 
said in the Avery Fisher Hall ceremony. -AP 
The Reagan administration wants ro double the severance tax on coal to restore the solvency of the black lung disability fund, congressional and White House sources said yester­day. A draft of the legislation sent by the Labor Department to the House Ways and Means sub-committee steered a middle course be­tween the equally unattractive options of raising taxes and tighten­ing eligibility rules, said a congressional staffaide who declined to be named publicly. The committee has been looking into the financial problems of the Black Lung Trust Fund, which pays benefits to coal miners suffering from pneumoconosis, commonly referred to as black lung. The proposed legislation, sources said, would double the tax that coal mine operators must now pay to support the black lung trust fund. They now must pay 25 cents into the fund for each ton of surface-mined coa. and 50 cents per ton ofunderground coal. -AP 
Roy Mackal is embarking on an exotic journey 60 million years back in time. He's heading for a remote, sweltering jungle in Africa -and hoping to prove that dinosaurs still exist. Mackal, an associate professor of biochemistry at the University of Chicago, is abandoning civilization for one month. He leaves for the Likoula Region ofcentral west Africa on Oct. 25. "We don't look for monsters," Mackal said in an interview yesterday. "We have nothing to do with the goblin world. As far as I'm concerned, it's straight zoology, but the subject matter is strictly exotic." Mackal, 56, is no newcomer to quixotic searches. He spent 10 years as the head ofthe unsuccessful effort to find the Loch Ness monster. -AP 
A new use for an old medicine can eliminate most of the 
nausea and vomiting caused by a common form of chemotherapy 
that is sometimes called "the most dreaded ofall the drugs" taken by 
cancer patients, researchers say. The medicine, called 
metoclopramide, eliminated the upset stomaches for 40 percent of 
those who took it, and the symptoms were far less severe for most of 
the others. So far, it has been used only on patients receiving 
cisplatin, a powerful anti-cancer drug, but researchers say it may 
make other forms of chemotherapy less sickening as well. 
Metoclopramide has been given to treat stomach problems in 
diabetics, and the researchers believe they have found an important 
new use for it. "This doesn't mean it will work for every kind of 
chemotherapy, but it may," Dr. Richard J. Gralla, who directed the 
research. said in an interview. Although cisplatin is the best available 
treatment for some forms of cancer, patients sometimes refuse to 
take it because of nausea and vomiting that can last for days. -AP 
General Motors Corp. is recalling about 6,7oo ofits 1981 mid-sized vehicles to replace wheels which could crack and cause the hub to separate from the rim, the automaker said yester­day. The recall involves certain Oldsmobile Cutlass, Buick Cen/ tury and Regal, Chevrolet El Camino and GMC Caballero models equipped with heavy-duty wheels, GM said. Only about 300 wheels 
are believed to be defective and those will be replaced at no charge by dealers, GM said. There have been no reports of accidents or injuries related to the defect, the automaker said. -AP

The same system that big business uses to save millions on its long distance bills is now available in your home. 
For years now, more than half the Fortune 500 have been turning from Bell to MCI for their long distance calls. 
In all, more than 100,000 companies, large and small, across the country make 2 million calls a day on MCI and cut the cost of their long distance calls anywhere from 30% to 50%. 
But the big news is that you can now get those same MCllong distance savings on your own home phone.

Rates show comparative pnnng hetween Bell's evemng rate and MCI's evening rare. Final mre authorities on all tariffed services are MCI TaritfFCC I and AT&T Tariff FCC 263. 
Nothing to install. All you need is a push-button phone and a desire to cut your long distance phone bills. 
The way it works: You just have to punch a few extra numbers on your push­
button phone. . Everything else is the same. Except for the fact that you save a lot of money. 
(If you don't already have a push­button phone, your local phone company can put one in for a small monthly charge.) 
Weekdays, MCI savings average 30%. Evenings, savings average 50%. And on Sunday evenings, MCI also saves you an average of 50% over Bell's rate cut. 
Who shoulduse MCI? 
Look over your last few months' long distance bills. 
If they're running more than $25 a month, you can obviously benefit from the savings tvtCI can give you. 
Since there is a $10-a-month fee (really a computer access charge}, if you're only a light user of long distance service, it stands to reason you might not be inter­ested. But if you're the kind of person for whom long distance calls have become a necessity, nothing's come along that can be as much help to you as MCI. 
For business, the savings on calls are the same. 
MCI's rates can be lower than Bell's famousWATS line. And with an MCI credit card, your employees can take advantage of the MCI savings when they're out of the office, trave ing on ness. 
Truth is, you haven'tbeentalking too much. You've just been payingtoo much. 
Naturally, with a new idea like this, 
you probably have some questions.

the Founders Day events, and joan Gjostein, co-chairman, were among St. Mary's students who modeled the various school attire ofpast eras. 
Tours of the campus ran con· tinuously throughout the day while the slide show, "Celebration of Women" -a presentation of the changing history of Saint Mary's ­was conducted in the afternoon. 
A concert by Norman Delio Joio in O'Laughlin Auditorium high­lighted Sunday's events. 
The agenda for Tuesday -the ac­tual anniversary date ofSaint Mary's founding included another presentation ofSMC uniforms dating from 1860 to 1962 and slide shows in the Little Theatre. 
In addition to campus tours, "Walk Through Time", a pictorial ac­count of the development of Saint Mary's College, was exhibited in a glass display in the lobby ofLeMans.

In addition, Sen. Charles H. Percy, R-111., chairman ofthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee, raised the possibility Reagan could go ahead with the sale even ifCongress vetoes it. 
Percy said the president c6uld use his executive powers to either declare that an "emergency exists" or that "the national security inter­est of the llnited States" requires him to make the sale without Congress' consent. 
Percy's committee is to vote on the sale Thursday.

GAINESVILLE, Texas (AP) -an 
elephant caught in the branches ofa 
fallen tree amid surging floodwaters 
survived by using her trunk as a 
snorkel until rescue workers could 
ford the swift current and free her 
yesterday, police said. 
But other animals who escaped 
rising waters at the Frank Buck Zoo 
after three days of heavy rain still 
were on the loose. 
"We don't have a full count of 
what animals arc missing, but none 
you could consider dangerous. 
Mostly they're fleet of foot, like 
deer," said Assistant Police Chief 
Carl Dunlap, after area cowboys 
started a Western-style roundup. 
"I saw a moose standing on the in­
terstate highway, but we got him," 
Dunlap added. 
Gerry, a 1.3-year-old female elep­
hant, had been reported missing and 
presumed dead Tuesday, but survived the rushing floodwaters by staying put and using her trunk as a snorkel. 
"Wt· could sec her. but we just couldn't get to her because of the swill w;uer." Dunlap said. "She was able to ket·p ht·r snout above water 
and breathe after she became en­
tangled in the treetop. When we 
finally got to her, there was about a 
foot of her back sticking out of the 
water and her snout. We could see 
her eye every once in a while." 
Zoo Superintendent Vince 
Reynolds said the elephant's trunk 
was scarred and her neck sore. 
"But she's pretty tolerable and 
calm to go through what she went 
through," said another zoo official. 
Cowboys in this north-central 
Texas town began a roundup Tues­
day of the zoo's inhabitants that had 
broken out when water from the 
flooded Elm Creek got too deep. 
As the water receded, two volun­teers lassoed a bush cow and cow­boys tackled a gnu. The animals were returned to their cages. 
Cowboys found a llama walking near an interstate highway, and deer were discovered on lawns south of the city. 
.Julie Broyles, ll, went to look at the swollen creek in the pasture be­hind her house -and saw a bear swim by. 
"I got out of there real fast," she said.

Murday in for more deja vu with trustees? 
It was no small irony that Don Murday had just popped in the tape Deja Vu by CSNY as one walked in to his cluttered, Carroll Hall roum last spring, though he probably 
·didn't realize it at the time. It was finals week, and most of us had big exams the next day. But Murday was studying for a much more important test -his appearance before the Board of Trustees' Student Affairs Committee. 
''If I had ever been here before I 

would probably know just what to do, Don't you? If I had ever been here before .. .I 
would probably know just how to 
deal, With all ofyou." Murday had been there before, 
which was orie of the reasons he was most qualified to represent the stu­dent body in front of the monarchs who are this school's final authority. A year earlier, he prepared an ex­tensive presentation on the dismal .::ampus social scene, including a 
" .. it often appears the Student Affairs Committee doesn't 
wish to bother the general board with the trivial concerns ofthe students. That's too bad." 
well-researched proposal to convert the LaFortune Ballroom into a cof­feehouse. It wasn't until September 
that he learned that the proposal had been rejected. ''And I fe'el like /' ve been here before,, And you know, it makes me won­der what's going on.'' 
The only avenue students have to the lavish Board of Trustees Street is down the rocky Student Affairs Committee Path, the middle of which contains a huge crater lined at the bottom with countless student hopes and needs. The maintenance crew is chaired by John Schneider, an exec of no little repute at Warner Com­munications, a small firm with some influence on the global village. 
All students can do is make 
proposals to this stellar group, which 
then may or may not bring up our 
gripes/hopes/pleas at the general 
meeting for action. And we may 
never know"if any of our proposals 

ever survived the crater, because the 
general board meeting is completely 
closed. How are the students 
represented to the entire board? Do 
the trustees know (or care) that 
alarming numbers of students are 
mauled and mugged both on the 
streets and in their South Bend 
homes? That the lack of anyplace to 
go on weekends is directly ac­
countable for the above average rate of in-room alcoholism among stu­dents? 
So Murday carried to the commit­tee five proposals passed by the Student Senate to deal with these and other problems. But he was most hopeful of the proposal that would al­low one student -any student-to sit in on the general board meeting, if only for the portion dealing with the 
students. This would allow some 
feedback, some sort of response so 
that subsequent proposals could be 
better tailored for acceptance. 
"Do you know, don't you wonder, What's going on down under you?" 
What resulted was a frustratingly 
familiar case of deja vu. The students 
were shut out again. Murday, who 
had advised some of the committee 
members in advance of his proposal, 
was told by Schneider "you'll just 
have to trust us" in taking student 
concerns before the general board. 
Few tangible results emerged from 
last May's meeting, although some 
money eventually leaked out to keep 
the coffeehouse alive. Proposals for a 
new student center, expanded off­
campus University-run housing, and 
revamped Placement Bureau 
procedures all dropped into the crater 
with little more than a desperate 
echo. 
"We have all been here before, 
We have all been here before." 
Now Murday, whose big push has always been for a student center, over and above a student observer at the general board meeting, will 

Tom Jackman 
return before this committee for a fifth and final time. Next week, the persistent SBP will spend his fall break on campus because that is the date the trustees have selected to hold their bi-annual conclave. You almost have to wonder why he still bothers. Student proposals, even with the continuity Murday has tried to provide, still are treated very lightly, and it often appears the Student Af­fairs Committee doesn't wish to bother the general board with the trivial concerns of the students. That's too bad. 
Other songs from Deja Vu might 
prove just as instructive to both 
parties involved-the trustees might 
like "Teach Your Children," or 
"Our House," Murday could dig 
"Helpless" or "Almost Cut My 
Hair." The difference in 
perspectives is wide, and obvious. 
Progress toward paving over the 
crater won't be made until that dif­
ference is greatly reduced, until the 
adversary relationship is abolished. 
The students have done their part.

Travels with Buckley (and friend) 
ISTANBUL The former diplomat (he is now retired) said, in answer to the question, that Turkey would send its foreign minister to Cairo for the funeral. "Beyond that, we haven't made any public state­ment. We've been pro-Israel right along, l mean we voted almost right away to recognize Israel. But we need good relations with the Arabs, and we have not very pleasant neigh­bors. What with the fall of Iran, there isn't all that much between us and the Soviet Union, what with Rumania and Bulgaria right next door, and of course Iraq. I thing Begin goes too far, and if Begin falters now, without the charismatic Sadat to smooth things over, it might get pretty rough. 
Nobody is secure these days, nobody. • · I used to tell that-not in exactly that language -to the shah. Maybe because Turkey hasn't been a superpower for a couple of hundred years he felt he could speak to me his private thoughts, and he did. And l would tell him mine. It used to annoy me, though, because every time he'd send for me, I'd have to go in a morning coat, no mat­
ter how hot it was, and sometimes he received me in a terrycloth bathrobe. Another thing, when you ordered tea or coffee, they brought his in a solid gold cup, mine in a pewter mug. So, after a while, I'd say: 'No thanks, your majesty,' and let him have the 
gold cup all to himself. 
"He couldn't understand the free press. One or two of our papers were giving him a very hard time, and he said to me, 'Mr. Ambassador, why do you permit this toward the head of a friendly country?' And I said to him, 'Your majesty, we have a free 
press in Turkey.' And he would nod, but I knew he didn't believe it. A month or so later there was a great attack on our own prime minister in the press, so I collected the cartoons and the editorials, translated them, and gave them to him. He read, but he simply couldn't understand. I said to him, 'Your majesty, why not give them freedom of the press, in one gulp?' And he said, 'It took you 150 years of gradual evolution. I'll do mine in two quick ones of 75 years each-in my lifetime.' He believed it. What he couldn't believe was that 
he was vulnerable. 

"Everybody is vulnerable. General Evran took over last Sept. 12 The leftists had planned a civil war for Sept. 24. They had huge deposits of ammunition and explosives. l and my wife couldn't drive home during .those past months after 5 o'clock be­cause the terrorists were there, and they didn't care who they hit. After 
the general struck, we found out they had fully developed plans for a civil war. They would begin by declaring the eastern part of Turkey an inde­pendent state, then that independent state would sign a defense treaty w;th the Soviet Union. You can imagine where that would have left Turkey.'' 
"How many prisoners?" 

"About 10,000. And we're not through looking for them all, they're still around, but terrorism is finished. Gone. Executed? A total of eight, so far, and it's been 13 months now. There are more who've received death sentences. But everyone shot was found guilty, by military courts. Sure, that's the kind of court you have when the military takes over, but the trials were public and 
everyone got a defense attorney ­everyone who has executed had 
killed people himself, in acts of ter­
rorism. Now a special board has been 
convened to review the sentences of 
the people sentened to death, and I 
think they are going to recommend 
clemency. I think it's much better 
thay way, myself. 
"But the military has saved 
Turkey several times in the last 100 
years from chao t s. We've done some 
dumb things diplomatically, and, 
well, aethestically. See that rotunda 
over there, yes, the marble thing with 
the black onyx columns? Did you 
ever see anything so hideous? Well, 
we built it in honor of the German 
emperor when he came over in 1912 on a state visit. That was bad enough, but then we joined the war on his side, ended up with the occupation. Got ourselves a republic, and moder­nism under Ataturk. But the army was there when we needed it, several times, and always they have given power back to civilians when things got in better shape. 
·'Oh my goodness, how we need 
time. We tried, you know to in-

On the Right 
--dustrialize everything at one t1me at­ter the war-bad mistake. Last year we had 125 percent inflation, now it's down to 40 percent. The invasion of Cyprus-a silly mistake, wish we could crawl back from it. But America's help is the most important thing, the feeling is pretty good on that score. 
."That palace? It was built by Murat IV, extraordinary ruler, died in 1640 when he was 30. Truly ex­traordinary man." 
He certainly was. "Strolling Through Istanbul " quotes a friend of the young emperor: "Sultan Mural IV happened once to be reading at Dolmahance (Palace) the satirical work "Schami" by Nefil Efendi, when the lightning struck the ground near him; being terrified he threw the book into the sea, and then gave or­ders to Bayram Pasa to strangle the author Nefil Efendi."

Spikers get tough for contests

The week before mid-semester break is usually a week ofexams and papers for most Notre Dame stu­dent!>. Hut for Notre Dame's women's volleyball team, it so far hall been a week stuffed with mat<:ht·s, and it's not over yet. 
Coming off a dismal 1-3 perfor­mance: In the St. Frands of Joliet tournament, Notre Dame turned around to capture the Anderson Col· Ic:gc quad-mt~et hy beating the host team, Manche.'>ter Colle~o~<·, and IUPIJ-lndianapolis. The three easy victoric.., boosted Notn· Dame's record to a rt.:spectabh: 12·13. That compare.., to a 3·19 final rt·cord last .;cason. 
The Irish travel to Indianapolis tonight for a dual match with Hutlcr University. Notre Dame lost to But­ler earlier this season at the DePauw tri-meet. Tonight the Irish hope to even the score and raise their record to the .500 level. 
After tonight's match, the vol­leyball t(:am joins Jan Galen's field hockey team on a fall trip out East. The two teams will be in upstate New York meeting schools from It­haca, Rochester, and Syracuse. The trip should give greater exposure to Notre Dame's athletic programs for women and aid in future recruiting

Bored? Want to start your 
weekend a night t·arlier? looking for 
a study break? A way to meet girls? 
Or guys? 
Tht'sc possiblities all await those 
that \'enture to the Angela Athleti<: 
Facility on Wednesday nights at 9 
p.m., thanks mainly to the dt(>rts of 
Tim Dillon. the assistant Director of 
Athletics and Recreation at Saint 
Mary's. But Dillon doesn't take all 
tht· credit. 
"When you give them (the stu­dents) somt•thing they want to do, they'll do it," says Dillon, who for­mally coached Division I gymnastics at Eastern Kentucky before heading north. "Without the students you've got nothing." 
The main attraction I~ the co­recn·ational volley hall program. No­thing formal ur fancy. just a little bit of Rand R -rt~st and rdaxation. 
"We've bn·n inviting one or two 

ofthe guy's dorms over," Dillon says. "It's supposed to last to 10:30 but they've been here usually until Il­l I: I 5. Its all been informal. It ha~ no­
thing to do with being organized." 
The brain child's origin lies in the 
much-talked-about social problems 
at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. "I 
just wanted to get people involved, 
where guys could meet girls, and 
girls meet guys, at a place other than 
a bar," Dillon says. "It's really turned 
out to be a. big thing." 
Right now all three of the Angela 
courts arc being utilized with about 
40-65 people participating. Also in­
cluded on Wednesday nights is an

season completed and state tourna­ment only a month away, the extra matches will serve as good practical, learning experiences. 
This hectic schedule has produced a few strong perfor­mances. One in particular has been 
· displayed by freshman Robin Isreal. It could be difficult for a freshman to cope with the pressures of several mid-terms, eight volleyball matches and the anticipation of the long trip. Yet, Isreal has met the challenge. She has played every point of every match this week, and is expected to play throughout tonight's match. 
Isreal is a strong, lefty spiker and a qukk back row player. She adds durability and spark to the Notre Dame lineup. 
"Robin is steady, but also excit­ing," says Van Slager. "She'll just coast along for a few points and then suddenly explode to initiate a big rally." 
Isreal has been able: to handle all the work and pressur<: so far this week. Yet, the whole team ha.~ not fared as well. "Scheduling is not an easy task," admits Van Slager. "I didn't intend to make this week so heavy. It just turned out this way. As a result, the girls really have to try and stay healthy -eating right and sleeping enough -but they also have to be mentally stable. Mental fatigut' can be worse than physical fatigue. 
Sophmore Carol Homme ha.o; some ideas on how to try and stay healthy. "You have to set your priorities and learn to plan ahead," she says. "You have to make sacrifice~ along the way. It's up to the individual to decide what suffers -studies, sleep, eating, etc. It's not easy, but you have to do it."

Gymnasts get it together 
Times used to he pretty hard for the :'llotrc Dame gymnastics cluh, now live years old. 
Cluh co-president Hrian \klaughlin recalls the days when the uneven parallel hars for women would hecome quite a nuisance due to the rickit\' shape they were in. For instance, just as a girl was ready to hit the lower har from her handstand position the har-just as :\1urphy would have it -tended to collapst·. 
"There used to he quite a few surprised expressions from the girls on the hars when all ofa sudden they'd he doing a full twirl around thl· upper har." smiles \lcl.aughlin. 
Thus, it was not exactlv the type ofduh that the "ion­Varsity Athletic Departml·nt was ahout to add to their list fi>r financial support. A lack ot insurance. no facultv advisor or home meet~. not to mention a general lack of interest in its tlrst \Tars, led to the aforl·mcntionnl harder moments in the club's earlv years. 
Last year things were difti:rnlt. There was a home llll'Cl. 
Purdue did send one of their guvs up." reminds \kLtughlin. "There were quite a k\\ pc·opk that came to that meet and enjoyed it. though." 
\1ore important now. however. is that quite a few people arc heginnin~o: to show interest in coming out fi>r the club itself. which currentlv has about 50 members. 
"Last year abuut I 1 0 pcopk cxprl'!->Sl'll an interest in joining the lluh over the course of the \-car." sav., \lc!.aughlin. who 'han·s the club presidency and cap­taincy with Saint .\lan··s senior Patti Larkin. "This \Tar we had 160 people who signed up on Activities :\ight alone. The time factor. though. is usuallv what prevents someone from joining .. 
The team practices two hours a dav -at St. \lary·s Angda Athletic Facility on \londa). \\'edne,day and Fridav. and at the Rockne \kmorial on Tucsdav and Thursday. 
The increase in pupularity is just one sign ofimprove­ment the dub has shown this \Tar in its efforts w achit-n· hetter recognition from the ;\IVA office. ln­~urancc has bl-cn obtained h\· the club. Jan <iakn (also tht: women's field hockcv l oach) has become its faculty advisor. two meets are scheduled at honH· for next senH'Stcr ( ml·ets are held 111 the·second scllll'stcr whik­thc hasics in practice are 'tn·sscd in the llr~t ). ami for­mer \\'isn•n~in g\ mnast Bob Yn>man has taken m-cr a~ 

the llr~t full-time gymnastics coach at '\Jotre Dame. 
"Our other major goab \\t:re to get hetter facilities. which we now have at Saint \1arv's. and to get hettcr equipment on which to train." explains \klaughlin. "La!->! vear we were able to huv 52000 worth of equip­ment, !->O "e arc hegining a very good growth." 
The sport itself develops perhaps the two most im­portant attributes for an athlete -strength and co-ordination. 
Says \lcLaughlin. who cornpl·ll:s in the all-~round division of g~ mnastics for nH·n. "\\ ith all the aerobic cxn-rciscs we're into. \'our O\Trall strength will in­crcaSl' since vouuse mu~des that vounormallv don't. A hctter awareness of what \our bodv is doing is also present so as to make tkx1hility better. 
"For thosl· that arc just starting out. we stress the basic floor cxcercises. then more graduallY we go to the a<.lvanccd ~rages where you need a couple of week; of wort. hcfon· you em start showing off to your fnen<.ls." 
Among those. hesidl'S \1claughlin. who em show off on the tloor i~ junior Ramh· KellY. another outstanding all-around performer. 
Senior Luis DeLeon. junior Ed Barret. and frc,hman \like Dorenbusch. nwan" hik. are gin·n top marks fi>r their pcrti>rnunces on the pummel-horst:. high bar. and ring~ respectively 
Sophomore Denise \k II ugh and freshman \1cgan Zil­lig. along with Larkin. arc the standoub in the\\ onwn's division. The uivision includes competition in the un­even parallel hars. balance beam. vault. and tloor ex­L'l'rcises. 
"\\'e arc out of our infant stage." says .\lcLaughlin. "\\'e han: now reached the stagl· where we very well could he added to the :-.IVA's list of having a full-flegnl club statu~. ~ext year ma,· be the third generation ofthe cluh where we do rccci\T that status. That's a nig goal for us." 
Ancl it could be rl'ally sonH'thing to tlip 0\Tr ti.>r the gymnaMs.

Lineup changes 
Hunter returns to split end 
By KELLY SULLIVAN 
Sports Writer 
Heading into the annual clash with powerful Southern California, Gerry Faust and his staff are making adjustments on the Notre Dame squad in an attempt to up their cur­rent 2-3 record. 
Offensive coordinator Toni Lich­tenberg announced yesterday that junior wingback Tony Hunter has returned to his former split end posi­tion. An ankle injury that sidelined the 6-5 Hunter kept the coaches 
from evaluating him at the wingback spot until just a few weeks prior to the season opener. With five games completed, however, it's apparent that Hunter is experiencing some difficulty in running from that post. 
He's averaged a little more than two yards rushing, yet Faust was reluc­tant to move him out because of his talents as a blocker. 
"Tony is a fine blocker," Lichten­berg confirmed. "Bt we have to get more out of him than blocking. We want to get more receptions from him." 
Hunter will join current receivers Mike Boushka and Tim Tripp at the split end slot. "We're going to try and feature all three of them ­they're all great talents," Lichten­bergadded. 
The Irish receiver coach said that Tony is having no trouble accepting the transition. "He's a team football player, and he wants to do what's best for everyone." 
Sophomore John Mosley, who saw action at wingback in last Satur­day's Florida State contest, will step in for Hunter, while freshman Joe Howard is penciled in at number two. 
Another change in the line-up will be at quarterback. Blair Kiel, who started the season opener against LSU, will again get the call versus the Trojans. 
"We're not blaming Tim Koegel for the losses," Lichtenberg ex­plained. "But the offense just hasn't been productive; and the first posi­tion you've got to look at is quarter­back. We've felt all along that Blair and Tim were both number one, and that we'd go with whomever was hot. We went with Tim for a while,
... 
and now we're giving Blair a shot." The Irish will take a few days off this weekend before returning to 
practice Monday. '.'We're going to do a lot of evaluation on offense," noted Lichtenberg. "We have to try and eliminate the mental mistakes, become a more aggressive offensive football team, and above all, put some points on the board." 
The layoff will give many players some time to heal, too. Among the starters hobbling around practice are Mark Zavagnin (thigh bruise), Dean Masztak (twisted knee), Greg Bell (shoulder), Chris Brown (hamstring), Larry Kissner (knee), and Randy Ellis (knee). 
On the road to recovery are John Krimm, Joe Rudzinski, Pat Kramer and Phil Carter, all of whom returned to the practice field this week. 
Novice boxers take first step tonight 
By MIKE GUENTHER 
Sports Writer 
Twenty-four of the Notre Dame Boxing Club's best novice fighters will take their first big steps toward a possible berth in this spring's annual Bengal Bouts when they square off tonight in the finals of the Novice Boxing Tournament in the boxing room of the ACC. 
The tournament marks the end of five weeks of intensive training for the men, and according to club co­President Dickie Tillsman, is the first preparation for the famous Bengal Bouts, which have been televised on 
· NBC's Sportsworld for the last three years. 
"I think that we may have as many as 30 or 35 guys who will stick with it through the winter," Tillsman says. " Most successful Bengal boxers started in the novice program here. 
After weighing in last week, 48 boxers in 12 weight classes ranging from 134 to 180 pounds fought through preliminary matches to earn spots in tonight's final. Because the boxers are novices, the weight classes were assigned somewhat for parity and the preliminary rounds were shortened to a minute and a half. To maximize safety, 16-ounce gloves, mouthpieces and protective 
headgear will all be mandatory. In addition, each boxer will have cor­nermen to guide him, and an emer­gency medical trainee will supervise each fight. 
The club's members have been concentrating on fundamentals in their five-a-day practices. Just last week they began sparring in the ring, and even then only under the 
supervision of the club's five 
student-officers, headed by co­
Presidents Tillsman and John 
Donovan. -Tillsman, a sixth-year 
coach and boxer himself, says that 
"Notre Dame has always had one of 
the most respected boxing 
programs in the country, and it still ·does." 
In keeping with such a lofty tradi­
tion of excellent boxing, there are 
some exciting matchups in the 
finals: 

In the 134-pound division, split­
decision winner Sven Johnson faces 
tough sophomore Tony Banacci. 
Banacci,.who rates as the favorite, 
wields a good height advantage. 
One of the most unusual fights 
will be that contested in the 145­
pound division, which features Chip 
Beatty versus Beresford Clarke. 
Clarke, a sophomore from Hol­
lywood, Fla., is a quick, powerful 
puncher who is also a karate student. 
Beatty will be hard-pressed to 
overcome Clarke's diverse fighting 
background. 

Perhaps the closest and most 
eventful fight will be that for the 
180-pound title. Dennis Cronk, a 
Flanner Hall senior who was 
bloodied in his preliminary fight, 
will take on Dave Condon, a Lake 
Jackson, Tex., sophomore. Condon 
is a stylish righthander with a sting­
ing left-right combination, while 
Cronk is a taller fighter with a hard 
overhand right. The edge here goes 
to Condon, but promises to be close 
all the way to the finishing bell. 
Last year, some 150 spectators 
watched the finals, and Tillsman 
hopes to at least equal that tonight. 
The public is welcome, and admis­
sion is free. 

Pulling ourselves together before USC 
.. 
One of the greatest assets any football team can possess is team speed. You can do so many things with il. We got a first-hand view ofthat Saturday in our loss to Florida State. 
We thought we combated Florida State's speed well enough defensively, but once again the big plays hurt us. Of­fensively, we had problems with il. When you go up against a defense that possesses great speed, it's difficult to get the big plays over 15 yards too often. 
That's why you can't have many breakdowns. You need consistency going up against a team with great team speed because the odds ofsustaining long drives are against you. 
We must commend Bobby Bowden and his staff. They have some great individuals. We were particularly impressed with quarterback Rick Stockstill. Our defensive linemen banged him around pretty good, but he kept coming back and made the plays when his team needed them. Give him a lot ofcredit. 
Another player who hurt us Saturday was punter Rohn Stark. When you have a punter like Stark, it's a great offensive weapon. He averaged nearly 50 yards a kick, and while Blair Kiel averaged nearly 43, the difference is obvious. Stark kept pushing us backwards in the first halfwith his punting, and it took away some things you normally would do with good field position. 
Yet, despite Stockstill, Stark and the team speed, the outcome was still in doubt until the fourth quater when an interception turned it around for them. Our player was open on the play, but our quarterback threw under instead ofover the coverage. 

After their touchdown, we felt we still had time but we never could get field position. And then time started to go against us at the end. 
We thought our players gave an all-out effort. They played with good intensity, and they took the loss hard. If we weren't getting better and playing with more intensity, we would be worried. But we are. 
The off-week couldn't come at a better time for our foot­ball team. It will give us an opportunity to work on the things that need improvement, but more important, it will give us an opportunity to get our football team healthy again. 
We are a little nicked here and there, but it's at a point where our kids are missing games and practices. Last week, it was difficult to prepare for Florida State with tailbacks Phil Carter and Greg Bell unable to practice at full speed because ofinjuries th~y suffered against Michigan State. 
Phil did not play because of an ank,e injury, but Greg, a sophomore from Columbus, Ohio, did start despite a painful hip-pointer. Then during the second quarter, he bruised a shoulder. Considering those injuries, we thought Greg, who gained 120 yards on 25 carries, played one fine game. 
Also during practice last week, we lost tackle Phil Poz­derac and tight end Dean Masztak. Phil took a helmet in the thigh on Wednesday and was on crutches Thursday, while Dean twisted a knee Thursday after making a great leaping catch. Although Dean wasn't able to play Saturday, Phil did. 
We hope the off-week will help our injury situation. It also will be good for the players. This is mid-semester exam time and break at Notre Dame, and we gave our players Monday and Friday off this week to prepare for exams. 
We also intend to allow them to take the weekend off. 
We've been together now for two months without a day off, 
and we feel it will be good for the kids mentally to get away 
from the game for a few days. They return Sunday evening, at 
which time we will begin our preparations for Southern Cal. 
Southern Cal is going to present us with many ofthe same problems that Florida State presented us last week. Coach John Robinson has another great team, one that also pos­sesses great team speed. In tailback Marcus Allen, they truly have the No. 1 candidate for the H~isman Trophy. He combines speed with strength. Already this season, Allen has rushed for over 200 yards in five straight games. Our defense faces a big challenge stopping him and his teammates. 
Southern Cal also will be smarting a bit from it 13-10 loss to Arizona last Saturday. And while they must play Stanford this week, the Trojans will be ready to play when they arrive here just because of the game's tradition. The Notre Dame­Southern Cal rivalry is one of the great ones ofcollege foot­ball .
