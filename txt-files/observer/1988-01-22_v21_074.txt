RA foils burglary attempt in dorm

By GREG LUCAS News Copy Editor 

A South Bend man and a juvenile were apprehended Thursday night in connection with a robbery that took place in Cavanaugh Hall, said Phil Johnson, assistant director of Security. · 
The two were going door to door trying to find which rooms were not occupied, according to students. The juvenile was arrested in the hall, while the man fled and was arrested later. 

The man, 18 year old James Cornell Walker of 1411 East Corby, was apprehended as he was walking from Campus near the Law School, Johnson said. Walker was charged with Criminal Trespass and was lodged at the Saint Joseph County Jail, Johnson said. 
According to Johnson, Walker was wanted on a Class "C" felony for armed robbery.

The College of Arts and Let­ters is enjoying a resurgent popularity, increasing the strain on certain departments within the College. 
"It's about as bad as we have ever run into," said Robert Waddick, assistant dean of the College of Arts and Letters. "We're very, very tight on 


"The juvenile was released to his parents and his case referred to the Park View juvenile authorities," Johnson said, adding that, "Security recovered an undetermined amount of cash from the juvenile." 
According to one resident, the juvenile suspect knocked on his door and said that he was looking for Tony Taylor. There is no resident by that name in Cavanaugh. A few minutes later, the resident said that he heard another resident yell, 'Hey, this guy ripped us off.' The resident said that he left his room and saw the two suspects at the other end of the hallway. 
When the R.A. approached the suspects, the man fled while the juvenile remained. 
A resident assistant in Cavanaugh Hall said that he and other residents were able Buried deep within the bowels of Nieuwland Hall, Steve Graff conduct an experiment on electricity.

Arts and Letters enrollment peaks, class sizes increase 
courses. Enrollment has gone up to about 2,600.'' 
While maintaining it is still too early to say, Waddick esti­mated the percentage of stu­dents, exclusive of freshmen, who study as Arts and Letters majors this semester could reach as high as 46 percent. 
By contrast, the percentage of sophomores, juniors and seniors with an Arts and Let­ters major in the 1978 fall se­mester was 31.95 percent, ac­cording to Charles McCollester, coordinator of analytical studies for the Dean of Administration and the Registrar. By last semester, this figure had rebounded to 
42.4 percent. "We're back now to the Fa­ther Sheegy days," said Wad­dick, referring to the dean of 
the College of Arts and Letter during the late 1960s and early 1970's. 
At that time the proportion of students choosing liberal arts reached a still unmatched peak. In the spring of 1969, 51.2 percent of freshmen an­nounced an intention to pursue a program in Arts and Letters, according to Peter Grande, as­sociate dean of the Freshmen Year of Studies. 
Thereafter the popularity of Arts and Letters declined, plummeting to a trough in the 1979 spring semester, when only 27.4 percent of freshmen said they would study in liberal arts. 
Last year 40.2 percent of freshmen expressed an inten­tion to go into Arts and Letters in the 1987 spring semester. Grande said it is likely this statistic will increase this se­mester.

ND  crime  
at  $35,000  
for  '87-88  

By ANN MARIE DURNING Assistant News Editor 
An estimated $35,000 worth of stereos, books, money and other valuables has been re­ported stolen on campus since students returned for the aca­demic year in late August, ac­cording to figures compiled from weekly Security Beats. 

Security could not confirm the amount because it does not keep such a total as part of its records, said Phil Johnson, as­sistant director of Security. He said the estimated figure seemed high to him. 
When Security indicates the value of a property loss, Secur­ity uses the value given by the victim, not a value determined by Security, said Johnson, ex­plaining that the victims can

One student house suffers six break-ins 
By SCOTT BEARBY Assistant News Editor 
Ifsomeone is looking to in­vestigate off-campus crime, they should consider the house at 719 E. Miner St. 
The seven Notre Dame residents have been the vic­tims of six burglaries, four of them within four weeks. 
"Everytime we came home we wondered ifwe had been broken into," said res­ident Trish Costello. "It was getting ridiculous," added resident Candice Becker. 
Between September and November of 1987, the Northeast Neighborhood dwellers estimate their total loss from the break-ins to be $5,000. Only part of the value of the stolen items has been recovered through insur­ance. None of the merchan­dise has been recovered to date, according to the resi­dents. 

Costello, a senior, said the majority of the burglars gained entry through win­dows on the first and second floors of the two-story frame house. The house, located across from St. Joseph's Hospital, has multi-level roofs which allow for easier access to the windows. 
Costello and Caroline Micek once came home to find their door wide open and the house completely dark. "Everytime we came home, we were scared," said Cos­tello. 
Becker said they all con­sidered moving, but added she still likes living off­campus. "I knew it (crime)

A friend in brings the 
I got a letter from an old friend a couple of days ago. I was really relieved to hear from him because I hadn't heard from him at all over Christmas break. Normally it wouldn't worry me much if a friend had forgotten to write, but this time I had good reason to anxiously await his letter. 
My friend is spending his freshman year in Jerusalem. It's hard not to be frightened when one of my close friends is living in an area that the international press says is teetering on the edge. 
We were unlikely friends in high school. He was brought up Jewish by east coast liberal, intellectual parents. I came from a midwestern, Catholic, conservative household. Our differ­ences far outnumbered our similarities. 
To this day I'll never quite understand how we became friends. Freshman year of high school we weren't too fond of one another. I thought he was too strange and too serious, and I'm sure he thought I was just a dizzy cheer­leader. 
Friendships, I found, however, are formed without rules. After about a year of almost identical class schedules I got to know him bet­ter. It turned out that by senior year we had formed a close friendship. Our values, our beliefs, and our views never agreed. 
We didn't like each other much when we thought about the other's ideas, but we learned that friendships don't need to based on common beliefs. 
Two weeks after graduation my friend left for New York and then on to Israel. It's strange having someone I know so well step out of the context in which we became friends and move into an international crisis zone. Before he left I would kiddingly tell him not to get shot at by Arabs. He just laughed and reassured me that Jerusalem was far removed from the fighting. 
We write each other often, much more then my friends who are closer to me and whom I see over breaks and holidays. His letters are like the ones I recieve from my other friends, filled with commentary about classes, new friends, old friends, and new places. 
But every once in a while there is a paragraph or two that sets them apart. Jerusalem is not removed from the violence and hate in the mideast. Earlier this year about three or four paragraphs down in a letter full of news of classes and such he causally informed me that the the PLO had declared a petrol bomb day and blew up a bus he rides often. 
Nothing brings crisis closer to home than a firsthand account from a friend. I couldn't stop

thinking that he was living in a place filled with unrest. 
He had gone a long way from the safe little neighborhoods we lived in. Things are vastly different where he is going to school than in my protected enviroment. My friend living in Israel has made the problems there more real and more frightening for me. 
I haven't heard from him yet about the recent problems on the West Bank and Gaza Strip. But in the letter I recieved from him about the bus bombing, he said the PLO's threats and actions had been widely reported that day in Israel. However, when he called home that day to tell his parents he was fine, they, and the rest of the States for that matter, had heard nothing about it. 
Not everything is reported in American newspapers. That fact, however, makes it even harder to draw conclusions about the unrest in Israel. It is a confusing situation with both the Palestinians and the Israelis having age old claims to the land in question. 
The fact that my friend is living in the midst of a crisis in Israel has brought an international problem much closer to home. The events hap­pening there are no longer just blips on a T.V. screen. The problems involve real people and real lives--the threat is no longer a world away.

Saint Mary's VP focuses on issues 
By KRISTINE KRUCZEK 
News Staff 
New Saint Mary's Vice Pres­ident for College Relations Dennis Macro said the key to his office's success will be his administration's eager attitude and his willingness to "roll up" his sleeves. 
Macro, who began his duties this semester, said fundraising will be his primary focus. 
An increase in annual giving, Macro said, is one of his long­term goals. Macro said he hopes for additional help in cor­poration and foundation giving. 
Saint Mary's College Rela­tions has the potential of be­coming very successful, he said. 
Education and planning, Macro said, will be his two greatest challenges. "The col­lege community needs to be ed­ucated (about the purpose of college relations)," said Macro. 
"Good and thoughtful plan­ning is also needed," he said. Yearly plans, part of the depar­tment's five-year strategic plan, will be implemented after research is conducted. 
In the short term, Macro said he hopes to expand research. This expansion is a "big job that has to be done in a short time," he said, and he will therefore increase his staff. 
Previously Director of De­velopment at Boston College, Macro said he had the oppor­tunity to revise and expand the development program there. Under Macro's administration, Boston College broke its fundraising records, including those for annual giving, pledges and number of donors. 
Macro said his most difficult adjustment will be moving from the larger to a smaller college and starting over again, beginning with re­search. 
Macro, 46, said his three main responsibilities are the alumnae program, which con­cerns the coordination and planning of alumnae activites, development, and public rela­tions. 
"This is an exciting time to be here," Macro said. " I hope to help working college rela­tions and assist the administra­tion any way I can." 

Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -More than half and in some areas nearly 80 percent of the men arrested for serious crimes in a dozen 
U.S. cities tested positive for illegal drugs, the Justice De­partment announced Thursday. 
The testing, sponsored by the National Institute of Justice, found that 79 percent of those arrested in New York from

June through November tested positive for drug use. 
Drug use was least frequent in Phoenix, where 53 percent of those arrested tested positive. 
The new information pro­vides "overwhelming evidence . . . that links drug use to cri­minal activity," Attorney Gen­eral Edwin Meese told a news conference. 
"Drug abuse by criminal suspects far exceeds the esti­mated use in the general pop-
AT STEPAN CENTER Saturday, January 23, 8:00pm 
ulation, where it appears to be leveling off," said Meese. "Among criminal defendants, however, it seems to be in­creasing." 
The tests show that among those arrested in New York City, cocaine use has nearly doubled in the last three years and has more than tripled in Washington, D.C. Cocaine use has surpassed that of mari­juana in New York City and Washington, the testing con­cluded. 

The use of two or more drugs showed up in 60 percent of those tested in Washington, D.C., while in Indianapolis, use of two or more drugs turned up in 17 percent of the men. 
The other cities and the percentage of those arrested who showed drug use were: Washington, D.C., 77 percent; San Diego, 75; Chicago, 73; New Orleans, 72; Portland, 70; 
Los Angeles, 69; Detroit, 66; 
Fort Lauderdale, 65; Houston, 
62; Indianapolis, 60. 
The figures were based on a sample of more than 2,000 men placed under arrest who under­went urine tests voluntarily. 
Most of those tested were 
charged with street crimes 
such as burglary, grand lar­
ceny and assault. The sample 
contained few men charged 
with drug sales, drunken 
driving or disorderly conduct. 
Reagan asks for more aid 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -President 
Reagan plans to ask next week 
for a watered-down military 
aid package for Nicaragua's 
Contras, but congressional 
Democrats said Thursday that 
even the scaled-back request 
will provoke a confrontation 
over U.S. policy when it comes 
to a vote in two weeks. 
A senior administration offi­
cial said Thursday that the aid 
request which Reagan will 
argue for in his State of the 
Union speech Monday will be 
close to $50 million, with the 
bulk of that amount earmarked 
for non-lethal items. 
Other officials in the admin­istration and on Capitol Hill said only about 10 percent of the package will be for lethal supplies. The reason, these of­ficials said, is that the rebels were well armed by an earlier $70 million in lethal aid and their need now is primarily for ammunition, which is cheaper. 
One administration source, speaking on condition of anonymity, called the request a "sustainment" package which would not enhance the rebels' warmaking capability. Much of the rest of the package is made up of transportation and communication equip­ment, as well as food and medi­cal supplies, the official said.

Mother of dead teenage stripper gets year in jail 



Mirror, mirror ... 
A student admires his immaculate image after being gorgeously groomed at University Hair Stylists. With many SYRs coming up soon, students are anxious to look impressive. 
Classes 
continued from page 1 
Their increased popularity 

have made some Arts and Let­
ters courses increasingly diffi­
cult to enter. "It's difficult 
enough for seniors and 
juniors," said Waddick. "By 
the time we get to sophomores­
-holy cow." 
Waddick singled out the psy­

chology department as being 
particularly hard hit. Philoso­
phy and theology courses have 
also proven difficult to enter 
because many serve as Univer­
sity requirements in addition to 
being selected as electives. 
In the government depart­

ment, the size of advanced 
classes has typically doubled in 
size from 20 to 40 students, ac­
cording to Peri Arnold, chair­
man of government and inter­
national studies. This has 
forced some professors to 
make compromises in terms of 
the kinds assignments made 
and the nature of testing. 
"We have no problem with 

an increase of 60 to 80," he said, 
"but there can be a problem 
with an increase of 20 to 50." 
The increase has meant 

longer times grading papers 
and the need to schedule more 

field trips for Professor Robert 
Vasoli, whose criminology 
class increased from a typical 
size of 80 students to 127 so far 
this semester. "It's a prob­
lem," he said. "I really have a 

strong feeling about students 
having to beg to get into a 
course they want." 
"It's kind of a shocking in­

crease," said David Klein, 
chairman and associate profes­
sor of sociology. "We've had to 
turn many students back." 
No definite conclusions have 

been reached as to why the in­
crease is occurring. 
Vincent Raymond, associate 

dean of administration, said it is unlikely that the trend reflects a declining preference for business courses because of the bad signs in the national economy, and he cited the in­crease in the number of under­graduate students at Notre Dame. "Business is still gener­ally preferred to engineering and then Arts and Letters." 
Wad dick pointed to  the in­ 
creasing  number  of  female  
undergraduates  at  Notre  

Dame. "It may sound terribly chauvinistic to say this, but wo­men do have a greater interest in Arts and Letters than engin­eering or accounting. Which does not mean that they are in­capable of going into enginee­ring or accounting, of course." 
He maintained, however, that the trend is not simply a local one. "It is not just peculiar to Notre Dame. En­rollment has increased nation­ally," he said. 
''Arts and Letters has be­come increasingly attractive," he said. "More and more kids are thinking of eventually going to graduate or profes­sional school. They also see it is possible to get a job with an Arts and Letters degree."

"I'll always have to deal with it," Jackson replied, her voice breaking. 
Three months before she put her mother's .357 Magnum in her mouth and pulled the trig­ger in March 1986, Mancini, 17, began to work as a nude dan­cer. During Jackson's widley­publicized trial last October, the government argued that Jackson forced her daughter into the stripper job and lived off her earnings, thereby driving her to suicide. 
The defense maintained that Mancini was a headstrong teenager who dreamed of fame and fortune, and Jackson was a disturbed woman who did the best she could. 

Jackson was taken into cus­tody after the 90-minute sen­tencing hearing. A bond hearing was scheduled for Friday, according to Lubin, who was retained after Jackson fired her trial attorney, Ken­neth Whitman. 
"I feel good," Lubin said after the sentencing. He said Jackson likely would be free during her appeal process. 
The judge "went below the guidelines, which was our main request," Lubin said. 
The defense had requested that Jackson be sentenced to two years community control, under which she would be con­fined to her home except for work, therapy and volunteer activities, followed by three years probation. 
"We're not asking for a slap on the hand," Lubin told Franza. "What we are suggest­ing is a very structured pro­gram for Theresa Jackson." 
Associated Press 
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -A woman convicted of driving her teen-age daughter to suicide by forcing her to work as a nude dancer was sen­tenced Thursday to a year in jail, followed by house arrest and probation. 
"You did procure a sexual performance by your own child," Broward County Cir­cuit Judge Arthur Franza told Theresa Jackson as he sen­tenced her. 
Believed to be the only mot­her ever charged in connection with her child's suicide, Jack­son could have been sentenced to 25 years in prison for her con­viction on three felonies. ­
She fought back tears as she told Franza that she loved her daughter, Tina Mancini, and would always wonder what role she played in her suicide. 
"I know I tried as hard as I could," she said of her parent­ing skills. "I realize I probably made a lot of mistakes." 
"Are you still dealing with remorse?" defense attorney Richard Lubin asked. 

Hoosiers: Just say no to sex 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -Students in Indiana public schools' courses on sexuality would be taught to abstain from sex outside mar­riage if a bill approved by a House committee Thursday be­comes law. 
The House Education Com­mittee voted 10-1 to send an ex­tensively rewritten version of House Bill 1067 on to the full House. House Majority Leader Richard Dellinger, R­Noblesville, the bill's sponsor, said he was unsure he could support the measure in its new form. 
The bill states that during in­struction on human sexuality or sexually transmitted dis­eases, schools "must teach abstinence from sexuality out­side of marriage as the ex­pected standard for all school­age children." 
The measure also states the instruction must "include that abstinence from sexual activ­ity is the only certain way to avoid out-of-wedlock preg­nancy, sexually transmitted diseases and other associated health problems." 

Dellinger, a public school teacher, had proposed lan­guage that would have told teachers to tell students that the only way to avoid sexually transmitted diseases such as AIDS was to avoid sexual rela­tions except in a "faithful monogamous relationship in the context of marriage." 
He claimed that attempts to change the measure were de­signed to weaken the moral statement that he intended through the measure. 
"I think this particular ap­proach is what the public that owns the public schools wants," said Dellinger. 
Critics of the measure agreed that the problems of teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases among students should be ad­dressed, but claimed the bill wouldn't solve those problems. 
"I think it's futile and ludi­crous to think that if we tell them, 'Just say no to drugs and sex,' that they're going to do that," said Jackie Garvey, an Indianapolis parent who works in school life programs.

Contras say talks will take place next week 
Associated Press 
SAN JOSE, Costa Rica ­Contra leaders met with peace mediator Cardinal Miguel Obando-y Bravo on Thursday and then announced they will open direct cease-fire talks as 
planned  on  Jan.  28  with  
Nicaragua's  Sandinista  gov­ 
ernment.  

They assailed as a publicity stunt the unexpected arrival in San Jose late Wednesday of a negotiating team from the left­ist Sandinistas. 
The Sandinista group, led by Deputy Foreign Minister Vic­tor Hugo Tinoco, said it came to Costa Rica to begin immedi­ate negotiations with the Con­tras, although the talks were set for next Thursday. 
Adolfo Calero, a director of the rebel umbrella group known as the Nicaraguan Re­sistance, told a news confer­ence following the Contras' two-hour meeting with Obando y Bravo: 

Alfredo Cesar, another con­tra director, said Thursday of the early arrival, "They (the Sandinistas) are simply playing games around a serious subject--the gaining of peace in Nicaragua." 
"The cardinal had no knowl­edge that the Sandinista com­

JERUSALEM -Israel eased curfews on some Gaza Strip refugee camps so Palestinians could go to work Thursday, and assigned more police to an Is­raeli highway where Arabs threw firebombs at a school bus.

A visiting Red Cross official said there appeared to be no critical food shortages in refugee camps under curfew, which supported the Israeli po­sition. U.N. officials who administer the camps in the oc­cupied territories challenged his statement. 
Defense Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin's decision to have sol­
diers beat protesters instead of 
firing on them brought this 
comment from the State De­
partment: "We are disturbed 
by the adoption of a policy by 
the government of Israel that 
calls for beatings as a means 
to restore or maintain order." 
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt said he has a new plan for advancing Arab-Israeli peace efforts, which he is ex­pected to discuss with Presi­dent Reagan at a meeting in Washington this month. 
In Cairo, a government 
source said Mubarak's ideas 
appear aimed at calming the 
occupied territories, and in­
clude urging Israel to end 
Jewish settlement there. 
Violent protests began Dec. 8 in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East War. About 
1.5 million Palestinians live in the occupied lands. 
According to U.N. figures, 38 Palestinians have died in the violence, nearly all of them killed by Israeli gunfire. 
Relative quiet has been re­ported for several days in the West Bank and Gaza, but many Israelis now worry that Arabs living within Israel's pre-1967 borders may take a bigger role in the protest.

be uncertain of the cost of therr possessions and sometimes overvalue their loss. 
The $35,000 figure reflects ap­proximately $4,500 in stolen bookbags and approximately $30,200 in goods stolen from cars, students' rooms, athletic facilities and other places on campus. Property reported as lost is not included in this tally. 
Several Security Beat entries did not list the estimated value of the loss and thus could not be included in the total. 
Crime is "easier to prevent than investigate," said Johnson, who elaborated that individuals should take reasonable and prudent measures to protect their own safety and property. 
Such precautions include recording serial numbers and other information about valu­ables and marking property, such as books, with the owner's name, Johnson explained. If 
stolen items are marked it is easier to trace and recover them if someone attempts to sell them at a pawnshop or used bookstore. 
Security did not have figures indicating the value or percentage of goods which are recovered. 
The manager of Pandora's Books, Ralph Davis, said, "(The used bookstore) is taking steps to ensure the ap­prehension and prosecution of any individual who sells us stolen textbooks."

The merchandise stolen in the burglaries included three complete stereo sys­tems, jewelry, three 'boom­box' radios and a flute valued at $1,000, according to Micek. The burglars also took less common break in items like two pairs of run­ning shoes, a space heater and a blanket, she said. "We're still finding things missing," Costello said. 
The women said they believe at least some of the burglaries were commited by three area youths who were arrested on charges of burglary Dec. 23 by South Bend Police. The three youths reportedly confessed to 25 Northeast Neighbor­hood break ins. However, Costello said that one of the residents spotted a large, white man climbing down from one of the second story windows during an at­temped burglary. 
The intruders must have kept a watch on the house to see when the residents were home, according to Costello. The residents interviewed said they believe the fact that seven women live in the house also made the house a more vulnerable target. 
Micek and Costello said they did hold parties during the semester and made the

Tradition grows 1n the Keenan Revue 
Approximately twelve years ago today, the first residents of Keenan Hall trekked across the snow-and ice-filled campus of Notre Dame to the campus of Saint Mary's College to start the first of three days of rehearsal for the first annual Keenan Revue. In its early days the Revue was a product of an am­bitious few who felt that the pro­alcohol-policy campus needed a non­alcoholic alternative for its weekend party-goers. 
Roger Kenna 
guest column 

The idea was simple. The residents of Keenan Hall would audition for spots in this premier event which would fea­ture musical talent such as singing, dancing, drama and of course, a few comedy skits. After the auditions, deci­sions were made as to which acts would get cut and which would stay, and five days and many long hours later, the curtain went down on a very successful First Annual Keenan Revue. And yet, though the Revue was very successful, those weary performers knew that big­ger and better things were yet to come. They were right. 
This year the Twelfth Annual Keenan Revue will be held less than a week from now on January 28 through 30. Though this year's Revue will be very different from that first Revue, the basic format has remained unchanged. 
This year, as well as in 1976, just five days after the last audition is per­formed, the opening of the 1988 Keenan Revue will take place. Yet, no longer is the Revue an effort of a handful of ambitious Keenanites, but rather, it is a full scale effort of the entire dorm, which calls upon every resident to help out in one capacity or another. As in 1976, the 1988 Keenan Revue will show­case the talents of many members of Keenan, ranging from song and dance to comedy and everything imaginable in between. However, it is a sure bet that this year's Revue may have just a few more comedy skits than its predecessor of 1976. Yet no matter what the contents of the show may be, the performers in this year's Revue will surely give their all in an effort to try to please the audience that has made it such a popular event year after year. In fact, the Twelfth Annual Keenan Revue promises to be one of the year's most exciting events and the most popular Keenan Revue in its twelve year history. As this year's Ticket Manager, I soon found out just how popular the Revue was going to be. 
When I first took on the job of Keenan Revue Ticket Manager, I did not realize the full responsibility and scope of the job. Being in charge of every ticket for every night of this year's Revue did not seem like a challenge, but rather, a decent job with very enticing fringe benefits. However, through my position as Ticket Manager, I have gained a new knowledge and focus on ti1e immense

popularity of the Revue on the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's campuses. For instance, this year over 110 invitations were sent out to members of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's faculty and staff to attend this year's Revue as spe­cial guests of Keenan Hall. 
The response has been overwhelming and has surpassed early estimations of the number of these guests that would attend. Also up this year is the number of special requests by Keenanites, who each receive four tickets, for extra tick­ets "for their parents who are coming to Notre Dame the weekend of the Revue." Whether more than half of these requests are legitimate is ques­tionable. However, a fact that cannot be argued with is the mere overabun­dance of people who are hoping to at­tend this year's Revue. Definitely, demand is much greater than supply. Though demand is great, the charge for a Revue ticket is non-existent as it has been ever since the first Revue. 
For the organizers of the First An­nual Keenan Revue, the decision to give the tickets away was the most impor­tant event in the history of the Revue. It was decided then and is still true today, that the Keenan Revue would be 
Seniors deserve better graduation 
Dear Editor: 

It has been brought to our attention that the 1988 Commencement ceremonies will be held in the spacious JACC. Students who request only one or two tickets will be guaranteed the "best" seats in the house while those needing three tickets will have three seats together. As for seniors who desire four tickets, a lottery will be held in late March to determine who may receive a fourth ticket. Such organiza­tion seems to demean the event in the eyes of many seniors. 
After four years and many thousands of dollars, the senior class deserves something in r£:turn--proper facilities for our commencement ceremony. Many seniors have more family and friends willing to come than the number of tickets allotted to them. 
This dilemna can be solved--move the ceremonies to an outdoor facility such as the football stadium. In previous

a free event, a gift to the campus of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's from the residents of Keenan Hall. I think it is this aspect of the Revue that has made it such a popular event and, at the same time, added to its mystique. I think it is important to realize that the only pay­ment that members of the Revue will receive for their efforts is your laughter, your applause and two weeks of homework that remains undone. Therefore, I urge you to participate in this gift by picking up tickets and at­tending this year's Revue in a show of support for every cast member's hard work and talent. Tickets will be dis­tributed today at both Saint Mary's and Notre Dame. Tickets for Notre Dame students will be distrubuted at 3 p.m. at Gate 10 of the JACC. Tickets for Saint Mary's students will be distributed at 6 p.m. at the O'Laughlin Box Office. Remember, one ticket per ID and two IDs per student. Also, no lines may form before one hour before the above distribution times, and tickets will b~ distributed on a first-come, first-served basis.

years, Notre Dame has held the cere­mony outdoors. Why can't we do this once again? Is the administration worried about keeping the grass green or the possibility of a sudden snow storm in mid-May? Are the acoustics not good enough to hear ... our mystery guest speaker (possibly Spuds McKenzie)? 
Maybe a compromise can be made. A possible policy might be to allot tick­ets for the JACC seating arrangement but have the exercises outdoors with the JACC as an alternate area in case of bad weather. The Air Force Academy uses a similar policy. 
Talking to many seniors, we find that they believe better accomodations can be found elsewhere so other family members may attend the festivities. Is this too much to ask of the administra­tion? We think not. If other seniors feel the same way, let your voices be heard!

Pravda reveals fear for return of mass unemployment 
Notre Dame-St. Mary's
Acne cream good for skin 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW -About 16 million Soviets will be laid off by the year 2000 under Mikhail Gor­bachev's reform drive, and some people are already wor­rying about a return of mass unemployment, Pravda said Thursday. 
The account in the Commu­nist Party daily gave more hints of the widespread con­cerns raised by Gorbachev's drive for "perestroika," or the wholesale revamping of the So­viet economy and society. 
Along with a more effective use of the labor force, the So­viet Communist Party general secretary has said an increase in retail prices is needed to pay the real cost of producing milk, bread and other food staples and reduce the $97 billion the government pays in annual subsidies. 
Pravda was the first official publication to publish the num­ber of workers authorities believe will lose their jobs as a result of the Kremlin's drive for greater labor efficiency and discipline. 
Joblessness officially ended in the Soviet Union in the 1930s under Josef Stalin with the in­auguration of centralized eco­nomic planning, and the 1977 constitution proclaims that each citizen has a right to a job. 
However, a new law went into effect Jan. 1. that forces many state-run factories and economic organizations to pay their own way, and that em­powers local managers to trim employment rolls. 

The anxiety with which some Soviets regard the possible loss of their jobs, in a society where unemployment was officially eradicated more than a half­century ago, was indicated by one reader's letter to Pravda. 
"It's like long-forgotten times are repeating them­selves," wrote S. Sokolov of Moscow. 
The newspaper, however, quoted Igor Prostyakov, a dep­uty chairman of the Govern­ment Bureau for Social Devel­opment, as saying that no one willing to work will be left job­less by perestroika. 
The party leadership, gov­ernment and trade unions issued a resolution this week that mandates the creation of centers for job placement, retraining and occupational counseling for Soviets who are laid off. 
Cat I ives after

Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES-Felix the frequent-flier feline hugged and nuzzled her owner Thursday in a tearful airport reunion arranged after the cat was coaxed from the belly of a jumbo jet where she had made her home for 29 days. 
Felix, a 2-year old calico, and female despite the name, became a celebrity after she escaped from her traveling box in the cargo hold of a Pan Am Boeing 747 on a journey from West Ger­many to Los Angeles on Dec. 
3. She flew more than 179,000 miles and made at least 64 stops on three continents before she was discovered by airline personnel. 
"Oh, look at her. She looks so well," cried Janice Kubecki as the cat was put in her arms at Los Angeles International Airport. 
"Look, Mommy. She's hugging you," said her 4­year-old daughter Nadine. "I missed you, Felix."

FAA wants pilots with experience 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -The Federal Aviation Administration called on airlines Thursday to avoid teaming inexperienced pilots in the cockpit, citing concern about the experience level of the pilots in the crash of a Con­tinental Airlines jet in Novem­ber. 
The agency also announced tighter restrictions on aircraft maintenance and released year-end statistics showing a 26 percent increase in the number of near-collision reports--1,056 compared with 840 the previous year--filed by pilots during 1987. 
FAA administrator Allan McArtor discussed the issue of pilot experience, airline main­tenance and the near-collision statistics at a meeting with reporters. 
The accident attracted FAA concern over how airlines team their flight crews because both crewmen had relatively little experience flying DC-9s--198 hours for the captain and 36 hours for the 26 year old co­pilot, who was at the controls. 
McArtor told reporters that the FAA has asked the airlines "to stress the importance of not putting two pilots in the same cockpit if they both have rela­tively little experience in the type of airplane they are flying."

Irish spirit. Why? Because he Instinctively reacted to correct 
the small l'l]ustlce of which he was a victim. 
As the Helsman trophy win­ner, should he have shown more class? In my book. he showed a great deal of class. "Those whom the gods would destroy, they first make big." How are they destroyed? The gods don't do It directly; they pare their fingernails while the heroes larger than life are destroyed by the bullying of the weak. 
Big John K. played football for Notre Dame years ago: he was a man-child the size of a mountain. His face was fierce to look at. but inwardly, he was gentle. Outwardly, he was gentle too, because he felt he had to be. As he told us, he was afraid to get In a fight. since he was so strong. he could destroy an opponent without really wanting to. Plpsqueeks with a little Dutch courage In them, he told us, were constantly challenging him to a brawl. John, not wan-wheel ' of a truck. which crushed it. Then they gave the poor dead thing back to John, to see his reaction. Years later, telling the story, he had tears In his eyes as he remembered himself as a young giant. so overgrown that he was as defenseless as the neighbor­hood weakling. 
Tim Brown, retrieving his towel. wasn't big John, helpless at the murder of his turtle. Tim Brown, mad Inside, was not afraid to act. His quarrel was with another player as strong as himself. Did he lose stature as the Helsman Trophy winner by not keeping his cool? To his credit. I think. he wore that honor lightly; he didn't regard himself as an Immortal who was going to sit still when his peers wanted to make a fool of him. He stood up for his rights. Only a hypocrite would find fault with him for that. as though he had besmirched the honor and glory of the game in which he excels. Where is It written that as a Helsman Trophy winner you must stay meek when the wise guys gang 
the Fighting Irish 
up on you? Certainly a touch­down hero, who Is also a gentleman, can't throw his weight around for the hell of it. But did they give Tim Brown the Heisman so that he could serve us as a Christ-figure of enduring patience? We can't  show Tim how a gentleman­athlete acts. He has shown up that a gentleman-athlete doesn't have to smile like Uncle Tom when he's being humiliated. 
As I have mentioned, I did not see the game. Why then, am I In such a sweat to defend Tim Brown? Because I hate seeing the strong having to take what's dished out to them by the also-rans, and you don't have to leave the campus to find instances. Fr. Hesburgh, for example, is one of the country's great leaders; yet. when he was ND's president. students kept complaining of him in The Observer as a hypo­crite. Now a university presi­dent doesn't put on the gloves against every loud-mouthed freshman attacking him, in a match titled Superchlef against the Bantamweight; for Hes­burgh, that would always be a no-win situation. Hesburgh couldn't fight for his towel, and the students must have known it. He stood by helpless, cas­ting his long shadow, while the young and the restless took the pound of flesh they weren't entitled to. He did it because he had no other choice; not because he was weak, but be­cause he owned the store. 
Years ago in a Scholastic arti­cle on sexuality, William F. Buckley was cited as a closet gay. Buckley sent a letter 

Keenan Revue preview 
I 
MARIA JUKIC accent writer n the depths of a cold and dreary January In South Bend, life In general can be­come somewhat of a chore. It Is with this thought in mind that a seemingly mild­mannered dorm on North Quad emerges with superhuman ef­fort to save us from utter despair. The dorm is Keenan and its answer to the winter blahs is the eagerly anticipated annual Keenan Revue. 
The Keenan Revue is "like the 'Saturday Live' of Notre Dame," says Paul A. Kane, director of this year's Revue. "There Is quite a mixture of talent. including skits, dancing. mimes, songs, and original musical compositions." 
The Revue debuted In 1976 under the direction of Rick Thomas and Steve Lenz. Though the originators are long gone, their legacy sur­vives. "There is nothing that pulls the whole dorm together like this," says Kane. "Nothing even comes close." 
Auditions are long and tough. Of the 140 skits trying out, only 30 to 40 will make the final cuts which are still presently under way. Thes tur­nout is an example of the whole dorm Involvement. "The entire dorm puts aside books, girlfriends, and family for two weeks and concentrates solely on the Revue," says Frank J. 
Huemmer, the 1988 producer. "In one way or another, 96% of the people get involved." 
And there are quite a number of ways to get involved. Be­sides the performers, there is a staff list of 25, ranging from Ticker Managers and Ad Reps to Choreographers and Head Writers. "You do not need to be an actor or a musician. Every aspect of people are Keenanites; technicians, ticket managers, staff, make-up, and ushers," says Huemmer. "This Keenan Revue is no small task. We will be eating. breathing. and sleeping the Keenan Revue until it goes on," offer Kane and Huemmer. 
This year's theme, "Saturday Morning Television", was cho­sen after Kane received the director's seat in the spring. "Basically, though, the real planning started in August." tells producer Huemmer. "We had to plan a concession stand and raffle to raise money, con­tact the auditoriom for reserva­tions, assemble the staff, order T-shlrts, and take care of all those little details." 
After Christmas, however, was the tough period. "There was so much to be done, I thought I'd need 36 hours in a day to finish," says Huemmer. "Last weekend, everything fell Into place. The task did not seem insurmountable. Now, we feel confident, very confident." Kane agrees wholeheartedly, "''ve been assistant director for two years before this, and I've never had this strong a feeling." 
The intensity level at Keenan is indescribable. Every corner of the building is devoted to the show. "Life just picks up for Keenan. Through the Revue, you get to know every­one. It is amazing how every­one gets together to put on such a large scale show in just two weeks," relate Huemmer and Kane. 
Tickets to the show are free. "The costs are covered in a number of ways: a concession stand, raffle ticket sales, T­shirts, and especially donations at the door," says Huemmer. "The bulk of the support comes from the door dona­tions, and without that support. the show could not happen." 
Although the show Is free, tickets are very hard to come by. Each Keenan resident receives a number of tickets. The remaining tickets are given to faculty and general distribu­tion, which is on a first-come first-serve basis. 
The Revue Is scheduled to run Thursday, January 28 through Saturday, January 30 at 7:30p.m. In the O'Laughlln Auditorium at Saint Mary's Col­lege. The staff expects a full house every night. 
"STAY TUNED", say the staff, "for an upcoming publicity stuntl" denying the truth of the allega­tion. His protest went someth­Ing like this: "''m not about to begin a controversy with a stu­dent publication; however, I'm hoping for the kind of fairness from Notre Dame that I might not get from a lesser school." The Scholastic writer, ack­nowledging Buckley's letter, did not exactly eat humble pie in the matter. Buckley, as far as I know, let the matter drop, with· out leveling the great guns which could have blown the Scholastic out of the water. Whatever his reputation was worth, he didn't fight to get It back. like the towel that Tim had taken from him. 

Margaret Truman began her debut as a singer while her father Harry Truman was In the White House. A Washington critic went out of his way to pan Margaret. in a review he might have written differently If she hadn't been the President's daughter. Truman reacted to the criticism, not in a presiden­tial way, but a fatherly way: he wrote a letter threatening the critic with bodily disaster. Truman's political opponents raised up cries of protest as though the Oval Office had been defiled. Most of the country enjoyed the human reaction of the feisty little man from Independence. Harry S. Truman, you can bet. would have cheered Tim Brown for defending his towel. 
What would happen if a team of Notre Dame students, not necessarily athletes, took on a gang of street-wise kids from one of the tough neighbor­hoods In South Bend where the cops tend to miss all the 

Spirit 

crime? Even if the Darners got the better of the situation, It would turn out for them as a no-win situation. can't you hear the bleeding-hearts now, fault­Ing the rich, well-fed older stu­dents for turning on teenagers, to bully them? 
The world Is unfair when the strong lord it over the weak. Sometimes, however, the weak have a field day humbling the strong; their very weakness is a position of strength, where the strong can't get at them with­out looking like storm-troopers guilty of brutalizing the help­less. The 97-pound weakling kicks sand In the weight-lifters face. When the weight-lifter gets ready to break the wea­kling in two, the latter defends himself: "You daren't touch me. I'm wearing glasses." 
In the world as we know it. the strong may be a football player, a celebrity, a politician, or a university administrator. The weak may be the kid who puts a turtle under the wheel of a truck. saying: "What are you going to do about it, you muscle-bound lug?" The muscle-bound lug may be so big--or highly placed--he's powerless. 
It does my heart good to hear about Tim Brown, stand­Ing up for himself on the turf on which he Is a professional. Maybe when he's finished with his towel. Notre Dame can place it In a trophy case of the JACC. It symbolizes a man's dignity, which he has fought for. Dignity, fairly defended, Is worth more than whether we won or lost the Cotton Bowl game.

Men's, women's tennis teams 
face spring 
By FRANK PASTOR 
Sports Writer 
Both the men's and women's 
tennis teams are optimistic in 
anticipation of their spring 
openers this weekend. 
The men's squad hosts West­
ern Michigan on Saturday in 
the Eck Tennis Pavilion, while 
the women's team travels to 
Minnesota for the Gopher 
Doubles Invitational, held 
Friday through Sunday. 
"I would think we're a slight 
favorite (against Western Mic­
higan)," remarked first-year 
men's coach Bob Bayliss. 
"Both schools are minus their 
number one player. Tim Carr 
is out for us, and their number 
one player transferred to Iowa. 
We beat them up there last 
year. Plus, we have a very 
promising freshman class, and 
I don't think they have that." 

In any event, Western Mic­higan is only the first obstacle in a grueling schedule which features Ohio State, Miami of Ohio, Harvard, and Southern Illinois, among others. 
openers over weekend 
"On paper, we've got our hands full," admits Bayliss. "But we want to play good teams. (Former Irish coach) Tom Fallon left me with an ex­tremely good group of guys, and we're all excited about the spring season." 
The Irish men are led by junior Brian Kalbas and soph­omore Mike Wallace, who are expected to compete for the number one spot on the team. Freshman Ryan Winger will most likely play in the third po­sition, while senior captain Dan Walsh provides the quiet lead­ership essential to the success of the team. Unfortunately, the Irish will most likely be without the services of senior Paul Daggs, who is recovering from the flu. 
The women's squad, mean­while, prepares to defend its North Star Conference title, but must first do battle with the likes of Northwestern, Iowa, Drake, and Southwest State, which comprise the Gopher field. 
"We've been concentrating on doubles lately," explained women's coach Michelle Gelfman. "With the return of (sophomore) Alice Lohrer, our lineup will be almost the same as at the beginning of the year." 
Surely, the recent news of freshman Ce Ce Cahill's invita­tion to play in the prestigious Rolex Indoor Championships in February will motivate the team to perform well this weekend. 
Cahill and senior Michelle Dasso make up Gelfman's top doubles combination. Sopho­more Stephanie Tolstedt and Lohrer occupy the second posi­tion, while junior Natalie Illig and freshman Kim Pacella play at number three. Sopho­more Resa Kelly will be sidelined for the remainder of the season due to a knee injury. 
As the season begins to un­fold, Bayliss no doubt speaks for both coaches when he en­thuses, "I'm very tickled to be coaching at Notre Dame. I feel a tremendous responsibility to place a team on the court which Notre Dame can be proud of."

Manning driven by Phelps' words! 
Associated Press 
LAWRENCE, Kansas Danny Manning says the 40 points he scored last year against Notre Dame were not enough to repay Coach Digger Phelps for comments he made about Manning's father. 
Manning said the comments will provide motivation again when the Jayhawks and the Irish play Saturday afternoon in a nationally-televised game in South Bend, Ind. 
Phelps made his comments after Manning's father, Ed Manning, a former truck driver, was hired as an assis­tant at Kansas the year before Danny began playing for the Jayhawks. 
"It was a very big influ­ence," Manning said, referring to his play in Kansas' 70-60 win last year. "I didn't really care for the things he said ... I can't talk about it. It's a personal thing." 
Kansas Coach Larry Brown quoted Phelps as saying it was a disgrace that a school could hire a truck driver to become a basketball coach. 
Brown said he reminded Manning of the comment before the game last year and 
he plans to mention it again before saturday's game.
Ed Manning said Phelps has never apologized for the remark, but he is not interested
