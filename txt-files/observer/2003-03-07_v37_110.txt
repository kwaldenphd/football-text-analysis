Senator addresses social issues at SMC 
By SHANNON NELLIGAN NcwsWri1cr 
Senator John Broden, D-lnd. addressed the Saint Mary's Community last night about his role as an ally and advo­cate of s o c i a I workers. Broden represents the inter­ests of most of the South Bend and half of t h e Mishawaka constituency. 
Broden's most recent action to aid social workers in their effort to help Indiana's elderly is his work on the passage of Senate Bill 493. The bill intends to expand Indiana's in-home care system, CHOICE. 
CHOICE was first imple-mented in the early l 980s and modeled after the successful systems in Washington and Oregon where 45-55 percent of healthcare funding is allo­cated to home and community based healthcare. 

"States who allocate a good portion of their funds toward home and health based care systems often find that they realize a savings in their bud­get. This is because they arc shifting funds from institution­al healthcare," Broden said. 
The senator believes that there is a real need to expand health care for the marginal­ized in society, including the working poor and the elderly. His current constituency in South Bend has a large popu­lation of widowers who are in great need of care. 
"Children and people on the margins are going to suffer, but no one wants to pay for it. You have to decide between raising taxes or cutting pro­grams," he said. "Everyone wants programs but no one wants to pay for it." 

In order to pay for the expansion of the CHOICE pro­gram in the midst of Indiana's budget shortage to halt his crusade in helping the poor in his constituency. He believes that a soda tax is one way to decrease the budget deficit. The tax will be a one-cent per 
$ 800 million budget deficits, Broden sup­ported the passage of a cigarette tax last year. This did not make up for the deficit and has lead to the possibility of large cuts of up to $263 million in Medicare.

Broden refuses to allow the ernment and community to promote greater social ser­vices despite the objections. 
He encouraged civil negotia­tion and contacts with the adversaries. By treating peo­ple with respect and dignity legislation will eventually be considered and passed. 
Writing letters and working with interest groups like AARP were also given as methods to get the attention of legisla­tures. 
"Few voice their opinion about current legislation to their representatives," said Broden of how constituents could aid in the legislation process. "It's the greasy wheel that gets the oil." 
Broden is a graduate of South Bend's St. Joseph's High School and Notre Dame's law school.

Students depart for spring break destinations 
By NATASHA GRANT 
News Writer 
With spring break beginning today, many students are already on their way to a week of fun. According to Kayleen Carr. assistant manager at Anthony Travel. cruises are the most popular travel means, particularly among the senior class. Carr said that over three hundred people booked cruises headed to exot­ic locations like Jamaica and Grand Cayman Island. She also said this is a great improvement over the less than 200 people who booked cruises last year. 
Carr said that she believe that the rise in cruise passen­gers is due in part to the cost. She said that cruises were a better deal this year. 
"It seems that the market is saturated. There are so many slots to fill and prices are down," Carr said. She believes that as more and more compa­nies enter the market. prices will continue to improve. 
Students like Kristine Rosario, who booked a week­long cruise to the Western Caribbean. couldn't be happi­
er. 
"It's an idea we had to get some friends together for spring break. The cruise came out to be the best alternative," Hosario said of her trip. 
Hosario said that a trip to Cancun, Mexico had also been a consideration. 
Flights to various cities in Mexico, and to Jamaica were "We book a lot of students to Italy and London to visit said.

Airport security strong 
By MATT CHAMBLISS 
News Writer 
Students departing this weekend to their spring break destination from South Bend Regional Airport have no reason to be concerned about a ter­rorist attack, South Bend Director of Security John Schalliol said. According to Schalliol students should not be worried about falling victim to a terrorist act because airport security in South Bend has been updated to follow federal procedures. 
On Feb. 27, the nation's terror alert status was low­e red from orange (high risk) to yellow (elevated risk) in response to a decreased terrorist activity threat level. 
At South Bend Airport, an orange alert status meant that every car had to be searched before being allowed to drive up to the front of the terminal. This policy was enacted in com­pIi ance with the federal regulation that all cars entering within 300 feet of an airport during an orange alert status must be searched. 
However, since the alert status has fallen back to yellow, the car searches are no longer necessary, although security personal

Men, put your shirts on 
As a cast member of "The Vagina Monologues" I attended a forum that took place Thursday night, in order to promote a discussion between those who protest the Monologues and members of the cast. All interested stu­dents -regardless Sofia Ballon of their opinion on the show -were

as well. Several of 
the issues posed 
against the Monologues were groat points 
that motivated conversation between dif­
ferent members of the cast and the oppos­
ing students through which mispercep­
tions were cleared and constructive criti­
cism was taken into consideration for later 
performances of "The Vagina 
Monologues." 
However, I am deeply concerned about the criticism raised about the monologue "My short skirt." The background of this monologue is based on several stories about rape in which aggressors were not convicted solely because the female victim had been wearing provocative clothing (thankfully such kind ofclaims do not hold up in today's court). 
The message this piece promotes does not only refer to the unfairness of such kind of legislation, but it also deals with women's self-image and their freedom to wear whatever they please because they want to. Women should not have to think about who is going to look at them, and should not have to worry about receiving glances or arousing provocation in men. 
One male student talked about having gone to Saint Mary's earlier that day and finding all the girls in the classroom wear­ing pajama bottoms "probably because they knew men were not going to be there." 
I bet you are already tired of all the let­ters and articles about the dress code of the women of Notre Drune, but I just want to state for the record that I choose to wear pajama bottoms when I want to, fully aware that men are walking all over the campus. Women should be able to dress in the manner they want to express them­selves, their style and their traditions ­regardless of how men will look at them. 
What is even worse is when women themselves criticize other women's cloth­ing (and I must claim I've been guilty of this, too), promoting judgments against people who are exercising their freedom to wear what they want to wear. 
IfI feel like wearing mesh shorts to class that have "Irish" printed across the back it's probably because of the warm South Bend summer (far, far ago) and that I like to sport my ND gear, not because I want to entice men to look at me from behind. I believe women should have the right to wear what they please without having to worry ofwhat other people are thinking or doing around them because just as one girl with a short skirt is criticized for looking "slutty," the girl who wears a hoodie and sweatpants is just as criticized for looking "slobby" and this must stop. 
Now here's were I get to the purpose of my title. Just think of how socially accept­able it is for men to wear whatever they please. Sweats -they're athletes, Suits ­they're SBG candidates, Shorts and no top -hey it's wa.nn. A good six pack is just as boWld to incite comments and looks from the ladies, a.s a short ski.rt sparks comment in men, yet I don't see any students asking them to put their shirts on.

Microsoft hands out dividends

It's payday for Microsoft 
investors. 
Microsoft Corp. is issuing its 
first dividend Friday, shelling 
out more than $850 million to 
shareholders, from the small­

At 8 cents a share, the annu­

acquisitions and legal claims. 
Of course. there are the not­so-average investors. 
Gates, who directly owns more than 1.2 billion shares of stock in the company he helped found in 197 5, will receive a dividend of about $96.5 mil­lion. Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer will receive about $37.7 million. 
Another 27 executive officers and directors will receive a total of about $9.5 million, based on shares reported in the company's proxy state­ment. 
Microsoft announced the div­idend in January, and issued a two-for-one stock split in February. The company has about 10.7 billion shares out­standing. 
When announcing the divi­dend, chief financial officer John Connors noted that Microsoft was the only compa­ny of the 30 in the Dow Jones industrial average not to issue a dividend. With many of Microsoft's legal troubles near­ing conclusion, Connors said the company felt it could afford the dividend. 
The payment, though modest compared to other companies in the S&P 500, is still a monu­mental change for Microsoft, said Howard Silverblatt, an analyst in Standard & Poor's quantitative services division.

President Fox says room for compromise on Iraq

MEXICO CITY 

President Vicente Fox said he sensed there is still room for compromise in the United Nations during a telephone call with President Bush Thursday, and called on "the other extreme" presumably France and Germany to try and reach an agreement on lraq.

are still taking the extra pre­cautions that have been the norm since the Sept. 11 attacks. Schalliol advised students to show up at least an hour and a half before their scheduled departure so they can get through the security proce­dures with time to spare. 
According to Schalliol there is a minimal chance of a terrorist attack at the South Bend Airport. He went on to add that bigger airports such as Chicago's O'Hare would be much more appealing targets for terrorists. 
"I think the chances are very low. We just don't have the people here to make that type of an impact. We wouldn't get near the media coverage," Schalliol said. 
Notre Dame students depart­ing from South Bend Airport did not express concern either.

indicated that a compromise solution could win support from other Security Council countries who, like Mexico, won't back an openly pro-war resolution. 
"The American position, as I was informed of it today by President Bush, opens the door to changes in what was previ­ously a hard-line stance, as well as possible modifications of the 
U.N. resolution they are plan­ning to present."· 
"That allows us to dialogue, and seek a compromise," Fox told a meeting of businessmen 
Mexico has joined with fellow Security Council member Chile. as well as Canada, in seeking such a compromise resolution. 
"We still have a few days to reach this compromise," Fox said. 
Fox said he told Bush Mexico could not support any unilateral action against Iraq, but said Bush had never sought to pres­sure Mexico or threatened any kind of economic retaliation if Mexico votes against a U.S. res­olution. 
Many Mexicans fear the United States will punish its southern neighbor if it votes 
against it in the Security Council. But during an inter­view Thursday in Tucson, Arizona, Foreign Secretary Luis Ernesto Derbez denied the United States was pressuring Mexico. 
"If there was pressure from the United States, we could handle it, but there isn't" he said. "There are statements. There arc opinions. There is no pressure." 
Recent polls have shown that a majority of Mexicans oppose war, and on Wednesday, Congress approved a resolution urging Fox to support a peace­ful resolution to the conflict. 

Also Thursday, Mexican uni­versity researcher Benjamin Ruiz who is scheduled to leave Friday to work as a U.N. weapons inspector in Iraq -said "my objective is to stop awar that to me seems stupid." 
In an interview with The Associated Press, Ruiz, 52, said he was proud to be serving as a 
U.N. inspector. adding that his job was to tell the truth. However, he also said he believed the inspectors should try to avoid a war with Iraq. 
UNITED NATIONS 

Britain to offer Iraq weapons deadline 
&sociatcd Pres 

UNITED NATIONS 
As opposition hardened against a war with Iraq, Britain offered Thursday to compro­mise on a U.S.-backed resolu­tion by giving Saddam Hussein a short deadline to prove he has eliminated all banned weapons or face an attack. 
With some 300,000 U.S. troops massing for battle, British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw made clear that any compromise must still include an authorization for military action. But Straw's demand, made a day before a crucial Security Council meeting, was unlikely to be acceptable to key council powers that favor more weapons inspections to disarm Iraq peacefully. 
President Bush, in a rare prime-time news conference Thursday, said the United States will call for a Security Council vote even if it appears certain that the resolution will be defeated but he added that he isn't afraid to go to war if the council rejects the resolu­tion. 
"We're days away from resolving this issue in the Security Council," Bush said. "No matter what the whip count is, we're calling for a vote.... It's time for people to show their cards and let people know where they stand in rela­tion to Saddam." 
"As far as ultimatums, we'll wait and see," Bush also said. 
The resolution, co-sponsored by the U.nited States, Britain and Spain, says Iraq missed its "final opportunity" to disarm peacefully and paves the way for war. 
The United States faces an uphill struggle to get nine "yes" votes and avoid a veto by one of the permanent members opposed to war soon. On Thursday, China threw its sup­port behind France, Germany and Russia, which have vowed to prevent the resolution's pas­sage. 
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan appealed to council members to discuss the crisis calmly, noting there were sev­eral proposals on the table. 
"The positions are very hard now," he said. "I am encourag­ing people to strive for a com­promise to seek common ground," adding, "to make con­cessions, you get concessions." 
Secretary of State Colin Powell arrived in New York on Thursday to try to win support for the resolution from unde­cided council members. 
He said the threat posed by Saddam must be dealt with now, not after thousands of people die when his "horrible weapons" of mass destruction are used. 
Powell and other foreign ministers will attend a Security Council meeting on Friday where chief weapons inspector Hans Blix and his counterpart, Mohamed ElBaradei, will brief members on Iraq's cooperation in eliminating its banned weapons. 
For many council members, Friday's reports will be key in deciding whether to vote for the U.S.-backed resolution. 
EIBaradei, the chief nuclear inspector, suggested Thursday he would tell the council that abandoning the weapons inspections makes little sense so long as the Iraqis are active­ly cooperating. 
"That's clearly the gist of my presentation: In my area, inspection is working. We are making progress. There's no reason to scuttle the process," ElBaradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, told The Associated Press on a flight from Vienna, where the IAEA is headquar­tered. 
In a hint of own report, Blix said Wednesday that Iraq is now cooperating "a great deal more" in providing evidence about its weapons programs and engaging in "real disarma­ment." He said he would wel­come more time for inspec­tions, but wouldn't ask for it. 
Straw, the British foreign minister, told a news confer­ence after meeting Annan that London was prepared to nego­tiate language in the resolution. He also said he was open to possible amendments that address concerns raised by the divided council. 
He did not spell out the details during a news confer­ence. But British diplomats floated the idea of attaching a short deadline with the resolu­tion, either as an amendment or a statement that would accompany it. The deadline would give Saddam a brief period to prove he has no more banned weapons, or face war. 
"We are open to discussion on the wording, but the princi­ple we are holding firm to," he said, emphasizing that Iraq has squandered its final opportuni­ty to disarm peacefully. 
U.S. diplomats in recent days have signaled a willingness to hear suggestions on the word­ing so long as there were no changes to the substance of the draft. U.S. officials said Washington had "not complete­ly signed off' on the British ideas. 
British diplomats said discus­sions were going on among capitals and at the United Nations, but it was too early to talk about the amount of time Saddam would be given. Several council diplomats expressed surprise that British hadn't approached them to dis­cuss their ideas. 
Russia's deputy U.N. Ambassador Gennady Gatilov said his government hasn't been approached yet about the British suggestion, but he said talk of a short deadline on the existing resolution "sounds cos­metic." 
"Just to add something to the existing draft in terms of putting deadlines. short dead­lines, one week of course, it will not fly because it doesn't change ... the substance of the draft," Gatilov said. 
Pakistan's U.N. Ambassador Munir Akram, whose country is considered a swing vote, said he also hadn't heard directly from the British. But he said his understanding was that they were suggesting "a delayed fuse." 
Asked whether that was acceptable, Akram replied: "If you don't want to set off the firecracker in the first place, whether the fuse is lit or not is immaterial."

Bush: We can invade Iraq without U.N. approval 
Associated rrcss 
WASHINGTON 

President Bush, preparing the nation for the possibility of war, said Thursday night the United States will drive Saddam Hussein from power if it comes to war in Iraq -with or without support from France, Germany and other skeptical allies. 
"It's time for people to show their cards and let people know where they stand in rela­tion to Saddam," Bush said at a prime-time news conference. 
Bush said he had not decided whether to invade Iraq but that it was only a matter of days before a U.N. Security Council vote on a U.S.-backed resolution authorizing f'orce. 
"Our mission is clear in Iraq," the president. "Should we have to go in, our mission is very clear: disarmament. It will mean a regime change. No doubt there's risks in any mili­tary operation. I know that." 
Bush said it was up to Saddam to avert war. "It's his choice to make whether or not we go to war. He's the person that can make the choice of war or peace. Thus far he's made the wrong choice." 
The president's news confer­ence came on the eve of a cru­cial Security Council meeting. On Friday, chief weapons inspector Hans Blix and his counterpart, Mohamed ElBaradei, will report on Iraq's measure of cooperation in eliminating its banned weapons. Their assessment could weigh heavily in deter­mining the outcome of the Security Council's vote on a resolution to authorize force. 
France. Germany, Russia and China say they oppose such a resolution. Bush said he would call for a vote even If it appears certain the United States will lose. 
Bush answered questions for about 40 minutes after making his case against Saddam in a 10-minute opening statement in the East Room. 
Asked how his faith was guiding him through these deliberations. Bush said: "I pray daily, I pray for guidance and wisdom and strength." He added that if he decides to send troops into war. "I would pray for their safety and I would pray for the safety of innocent Iraqi lives as well." 
Bush, growing teary-eyed, said it was a "humbling experi­ence" to know that people he's never met "have lifted me and my family up in prayer. It's been a comforting feeling to know that." 
Turning to another hot spot, Bush said the best way to deal with rising tensions with North Korea is to involve other nations in the region, such as China, South Korea, Japan and Russia. 
"I think the best way to deal 

with this is in multilateral ests," Bush said. fashion by convincing those Bush's news conference was nations that they must stand part of an intensifying cam­up to their responsibilities, paign to prepare Americans along with the United States to for the possibility of a war that convince Kim Jong II that could be just days away. development of a nuclear arse­Military leaders say U.S. forces nal is not in his nation's inter-are now ready to strike Iraq.

Airline crash in Sahara kills 102; lone soldier survives 
As.ociated Press 
ALGIERS 

An Air Algerie passenger jet, one of its engines ablaze, crashed shortly after takeoff deep in the Sahara Desert on Thursday, and 102 people were killed. officials said. A young soldier survived. 
The Boeing 737, flight 6289, crashed after taking off from Tamanrasset bound for the Algerian capital. Algiers, 1,000 miles to the north. 
Terrorism was not suspected, said an airline spokesman, Hamid Hamdi. 
"There was a mechanical problem on takeoff," he said. "There is no element that leads us to think there was a terror­ist attack." 
Witnesses at the Tamanrasset airport and airline officials said one of the plane's two jet engines caught fire as it was taking off. 
APS, Algeria's official state-run news agency, and airline officials at the scene said 102 had been killed. But an official at the airline's office in Algiers told The Associated Press that he couldn't imme­diately confirm the number of deaths. 
"Unfortunately, we know only of one survivor," said Hamdi, identifying him as a young Algerian soldier who was in a critical but stable condition in a Tamanrasset hospital. 
Algeria, an oil-and gas-rich nation in North Africa, has been torn by a decade­long insurgency by Islamic militants that has left tens of thousands dead. 
Seven French citizens were among the 97 passengers, APS reported. Hamdi said he knew of six Europeans aboard. The remaining passengers and six crew members were Algerians, he said. 
Hamdi said 39 passengers were head­ed for Algiers and that 58 others were to disembark at a stop in Ghardaia. 
Prime Minister Ali Benflis set up a cri­sis unit at airports in Algiers and Tamanrasset to deal with the crash, thought to be the first in the history of Algerian commercial aviation. An inves­tigative unit was also set up at the Tamanrasset airport. 
Hamdi, the airline spokesman, insisted that the downed plane had been well maintained. 
"This Boeing 737-200 was, at takeoIT, in perfect working order," he said. State-run Air Algerie was established in 1953 and this was its first crash, he said. 
Interior Minister Yazid Zerhouni and Transportation Minister Abdelmalek Sellai were headed to the scene.

Microsoft to pay first-ever dividend 
It's payday for Microsoft investors. 
Microsoft Corp. is issuing its first dividend Friday, shelling out more than $850 million to shareholders, from the smallest investor right up to co-founder Bill Gates. 
At 8 cents a share, the annual payout won't be huge to the average investor, analysts said. But it still marks a significant change for the Redmond, Wash . software company that went public in 1986 and has long hoarded its cash -now $43.4 billion -for research, acquisitions and legal claims. 
Microsoft announced the dividend in January, and issued a two-for-one stock split in February. The company has about 10.7 bil­lion shares outstanding. 
Visa fights fraud by hiding numbers

While many merchants already truncate the 16-digit card numbers on receipts, Visa will require, beginning July 1, that new credit­card machines display only the last four dig­its, company chief executive officer Carl Pascarella said Thursday. 
All machines that accept Visa cards must comply with the change by mid-2006, Pascarella said.

The non-binding resolution won 58 percent to 42 percent at the meeting, which took place in Hamilton, Bermuda.

February retail sales disappoint 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK 
Winter storms dealt a major blow to February sales at the nation's retailers, where business has already suffered amid the weak economy and worries about a possible war with Iraq. 
As merchants reported their February results Thursday, Wal-Mart Stores Jnc. announced sales at the low end of its expectations, and apparel retailers and department stores were again the hardest hit. Consumers had no incentive to buy spring fashions like micro-miniskirts in the frigid cold, analysts said. 
But some retailers were exceptions, incluqing Pacific Sqnwear of California Inc. and Gap Inc., both of which reported that sales at stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, beat Wall Street expectations. Same-store sales are considered the best gauge of a retailer's health. 
Overall, though, "this was a weak reading, and it is the same story line. But the only difference is that the weather complicated the issue," said Michael P. Niemira, vice president of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. '"Weather is a passing problem, but concern about war and the economy is a lingering issue and therein lies the problem." 
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi's same­store sales tally of 78 stores was up only 0.8 percent in February, com­pa,r!}~ with an increase of 6.2 percent 
. 

a year ago, when unusually warm weather helped spur sales of spring clothes. Niemira said it was the weakest performance since last November. when the index was unchanged. 
The biggest blow in February came when a snowstorm blanketed the Northeast during the President's Day weekend, forcing many stores to close and wiping out the much-antici­pated sales bonanza needed to jump­start the spring season. 
Niemira estimated that the holiday storm as well as extreme cold weath­er and other storms in the Northeast and Midwest last month shaved about 1 to 1.5 percentage points on average from the monthly sales fig­ures at national chains.

N.J. man tortures hamsters 
Associated Press 
SOMERVILLE, N.J. 
A man caught torturing hamsters he had just bought from a pet store has been sen­tenced to three years proba­tion. 
Richard Mattia was also ordered Wednesday to under­go substance abuse and psy­chiatric counseling as part of the plea bargain he reached with Somerset County authori­ties. 
He initially was charged with animal cruelty and then faced drug possession after police found 18 packets of heroin on him when he was arrested. 
Mattia was charged last October after a Watchung pct store employee saw him squeezing the hamster. Authorities said Mattia also clipped the hamsters' teeth so it wouldn't bite him. 
Mattia also faces animal cru­elty charges in Mountainside and is scheduled to appear in municipal court there next week. Those charges were filed by the New Jersey Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals after two dw,1rf ham­sters were found at Mattia's home last year. 
Officials said one of the ham­sters died after it was bruised and Us teeth were damaged by nail clippers. The second ham­ster survived and. along with the hamster from the pct store case, was adopted.

Clinton, Dole to debate on '60 Minutes' 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK 
Former President Clinton and his 1996 election oppo­nent Bob Dole are joining the CBS newsmagazine "60 Minutes" for weekly debates on national issues in the show's old "Point­Co u n tc r ­point" style.

The two Clinton agreed to 10 segments, starting Sunday night, but CBS executives say the network will consider extending the debates into 
next season. 

Clinton said he often watch­es some of the political shows on cable television that degenerate into screaming matches. 
"There may be a market for people who want light instead of heat," the former president said. 
The retired politicians taped their first segment Friday morning, declining to identify the topic. Asked who won. Clinton said, "He did." 
"I got a 'B,'" said Dole, the 
former 


Senato majority leader. "He got a 
' B 
minus."' 
Clinton said that given their 

Dole old jobs, 
both men want to be careful about what they say regarding any poten­tial war with Iraq. All citizens want to be supportive of the armed forces, he said. 
Clinton. who has reportedly been offered several televi­sion opportunities, said the CBS idea appealed to him because "60 Minutes" is a serious show. "It's just once a week and not too long, so we won't be in anybody's way,"

HAVANA 
President Fidel Castro was elected a sixth term Thursday and he wasted no time in criti­cizing the United States, warn­ing that Cuba doesn't need its foreign office. 
The 76-year-old leader made the veiled threat about the sta­tus of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana as an angry response to a public visit last month by section chief James Cason to a meeting with Havana dissidents. 
"Anyone can see that this is a shameless and defiant provoca­tion," Castro said of Cason's meeting with the dissidents. 
"Perhaps the numerous U.S. intelligence agents working at the Interests Section could explain to him that Cuba can easily do without this office -a breeding ground for counter­revolutionaries and a command post for the most offensive sub­versive actions against our country." 
Castro, the world's longest ruling head of government, acknowledged he won't be around forever after being elected by Cuba's parliament to another term that would have him governing until he is 81. 
"I promise that I will be with you, if you so wish, for as long as I feel that I can be useful ­and if it is not decided by nature before," the 76-year-old Castro said in a rare reference to his advancing age and mor­tality. "Not a minute less and not a second more.

Castro wins sixth term as president 
the end of my life," added Castro. 
Castro, now in power for 44 years, holds the title of President of the Council of State, this communist-run island's supreme governing body. The sole presidential can­did ate in Thursday's vote, Castro wore a dark suit and tie rather than his typical olive green military uniform. 
Deputies later re-elected Ricardo Alarcon to his third five-year term as speaker of the parliament. Alarcon is Castro's point man on Cuba-U.S. rela­tions. 
Castro was elected by National Assembly deputies to his fifth presidential term five years ago . 
Castro has been Cuba's unchallenged leader since 1959, though he was elected 
president only in 1976. The second-longest ruling head of government is President Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo, who has been in power since 1967. 
More than 97 percent of Cuba's voters in January elect­ed Castro and the rest of the 609 candidates who ran uncon­tested for parliament, including Juan Miguel Gonzalez, the father of Elian Gonzalez, the boy at the center of the 2000 international child custody bat­tle. 
A handful of international reporters who were invited to the Feb. 24 meeting by dissi­dents were surprised to find Cason there. The diplomat, who arrived in Havana about six months ago, gave reporters a brief interview, reading from prepared notes. ·

Sudents cope with troop departures 
By HOLDER SHANNON Nonh Carolina State U. 
RALEIGH, N.C. 

With the deployment of more than 200,000 U.S. troops to the Middle East region, many students at North Carolina State University are dealing with loved ones going overseas. 
Mark McLawhorn, a senior in art design. found out two weeks ago that hisyounger brother, Philip, is possibly going to Turkey. Philip has been in the Air Force for about four years. Though McLawhorn is not daily affected by his brother's deployment, his mother is having a difficult time. 
"The biggest impact of him leaving was on my mother ... just becausewhenever some­one's children [are] in the military, there's a threat that they may never make it back 
to  American  soil,"  
McLawhorn said.  
His mother  seems  to  be  

dealing with Philip's depar­ture fairly well, but she steers clear of movies such

but would rather not disclose what his brother's duty is other than "running detail." 
Mclawhorn is unsure of whether his brother is in dan­ger because "nothing has happened yet." 
"Maybe if this was day one and we were trying to drive down the streets of Baghdad, then that would be some­thing, but there is no notion of what is going to happen," he added. "Something is going to happen, there's too much politics and bravado wrapped up in it now, regardless of how many mis­siles Hussein destroys or claims to destroy." 
McLawhorn is undecided on the future of a war with Iraq, commenting, "I don't think I'll ever see it as a clear-cut 
f i g h t against good ver­sus evil, like a World War II scenario where you had a Hitler, because it's more broad. Right now, it's about Saddam Hussein, but next

out in the street protesting the war wouldn't be able to do that if it weren't for the people in the military guarding our borders," McLawhorn said. 
Joshua Smith, a graduate student in physics, has a brother-in-law stationed in the Persian Gulf. Smith's brother-in-law, Mark, has been in the Navy for about seven years and has been in the Middle East since July. 
''I don't think he's in dan­ger, like if he was a pilot. He works on an aircraft carrier, 

I really don't feel like he is in any danger," Smith said. 
Having family sta­tioned in the Middle East has not changed Smith's view of the possi­bility of war. 
"Basically, I make my own judg­ments on these sorts of things. 
Mark's in the Navy, and that's his job," remarked Smith. "If he goes to another part of the world to fight a war that I may or may not agree with, it's still his job. It's just like the police officer who gives you a speeding ticket -he's just doing his job, regardless of how you feel about it." 
At this time, Smith is against a war with Iraq. 
"I think that war is a pretty barbaric idea; since the beginning of civilization, there have been wars. I don't think at this point in our his­tory it is necessary to fight a war, but I do realize that sometimes war is necessary," he said. "I would be for a war if it were demonstrated that that the Iraqi regime posed an imminent threat to the United States and its interest. I haven't been convinced of that yet. and so I don't think that it is necessary right now." 
Students with family mem­bers being deployed may be confused on where to stand on the Iraqi issue, but they are not confused about sup­porting the military. Most say they will support their loved ones regardless of their own personal beliefs about war. 
Man faces trial for attempt to buy child 
By NATE TABAK 
Daily Californian 
OAKIAND, Calif. 
An infamous child predator must stand trial for allegedly try­ing to buy a 4-year-old boy for $500 in Berkeley, Calif. a judge ruled Wednesday. 
Kenneth Eugene Parnell, 71, sat stoically in a wheelchair in Alameda County Superior Court as a prosecutor played recordings of him arranging to make the purchase. 
Parnell gained infamy for kid­napping 7-year-old Steven Stayner in 1972 and keeping him for seven years. Stayner told police Parnell had molested him. 
Parnell was arrested at his West Berkeley home on Mathews Street Jan. 3 after he allegedly gave the informant, Diane Stevens, $100 for a birth certifi­
cate of a child that she claimed 
was waiting outside in a car. 
He was charged with attempted purchasing of a person, attempt­ed child theft and solicitation to commit a kidnapping. 
Stevens described in testimony Wednesday how she met Parnell, who went by the name "Gene" in 2001, through her brother who was his in-home caretaker. 
Stevens said her brother told her about Parnell's past during that time. 
After Stevens' brother died in December, Parnell called her to buy a case of the nutritional bev­erage Ensure. 
Stevens said their contact over the next year stuck to drink transactions until Dec. 12, when he offered $500 for her to "get him a child" between 4 and 6 years old that he would raise as his own. 
"I was stunned," Stevens said.

Because Jensen and Jablonski-Diehl made this project not only their undertaking, but the Widertaking of the entire student gov­ernment, they achieved something that will have tangible results for College students.

Our study-abroad advisor from Notre Dame visited Cairo today, and she mentioned that there have been .numerous let­ters in the Observer about worries for students studying abroad. Also, the office in Hurley Hall has received many phone calls from parents concerned about their kids in the dif­ferent programs. 
I always appreciate it when friends ask me how I am holding up and how safe I feel, but I wish I could bring all those people here to see what it's really like. My friend and fellow domer, Aaron and I, are doing just fine in Cairo. I assume the same is true for all the students abroad elsewhere. 
On the streets, when people ask me where I am from, I refuse to hide and say I am from Canada. I always say proudly that I am an American. I hope, too, in several months time to have that same pride. Usually this leads into a discussion about Iraq. Yesterday, outside the mosque ofAmr ibn al-As, I chatted in choppy Arabic with three old Egyptian men about the grave situation in the Middle East. They told me how they loved American people, and I told them how I loved Egyptian people. We decided that next week we ought to gather again outside the mosque and invite Saddam Hussein and President Bush to join us to discuss their differences. Not once did I feel uncom­fortable. 
Not once have I ever felt threatened here traveling or con­versing, even in a section called "Old Islamic Cairo," whose name would probably scare many who have not been here. Insane traffic seems to be the only threat. I do not claim to have been to Iraq. Cairo is not Baghdad, I know, but Baghdad is not too far, nonetheless. I do not claim to have more per­spective than anyone else at home. However, this experience inevitably shapes my perspective. 
I hope some time to meet Aaron's two roommates who are from the Gaza Strip and maybe find out what life is like as a Palestinian. I enjoy getting harassed and surrounded by little

academic calendar. Adding study days to the calendar has been a promise student government representatives have been making to the student body for the past 10 years, but give Jensen and Jablonski-Diehl credit for finally succeeding. 
Previous student government adminis­trations did not completely undertake the study day endeavor. No other administra­tion in the past 10 years took the time to thoroughly research or put together a comprehensive proposal, therefore making it diflicult for faculty and admini,;trators to take the need for study day seriously. 
Today, the student body can be proud of what its student govemm.ent representa­tives have accomplished and how they accomplished their goal. By being pre­pared and acting in a professional manner. student government gained the attention and respect of the College's faculty and administration. 
It really does make a difference when you do your humework. 
Egyptian kids, who probably are not that different from kids in Baghdad and who probably are not that different from kids in South Bend. 
I am fascinated by the anti-war demonstrations that take place on campus, because there are hundreds of police in riot gear ready to suppress any freedom of expression. The govern­ment just renewed the "emergency laws" in order to prolong this police-state for another three years, to everybody's disap­pointment. You see, there is little freedom here -even in Egypt -and these students want freedom more than any­thing, but they also do not want war and they fear American intervention. 
I do not buy stories that Bush is only in this for oil or to finish something his father started. Weapons of mass destruction and changing the Iraqi regime are serious, truthful matters. In try­ing to soak all this in, though, my only truthful conclusion is that war is not the answer in this case. I knew that before I came here. This area is too complex to fully explain in this let­ter, so this may be an unsatisfactory answer to many: But, full­fledged diplomacy is the only way now. My hope is that Bush (and his advisors) knows what war· will mean for people in this area and for Americans. My biggest fear is that he doesn't know. 
No matter what happens here, I appreciate my friends' and family's concern. I am sure others abroad (and their families) are apprehensive, rightfully so, about what is going to happen in the world. But, please do not worry too much. If the war does happen, we will stay until the end of the semester because I am pretty sure we'll be fine.

You're welcome, Father Poorman 

Dig hole in sand, insert head, cover sufliciently. 
I congratulate those ofus on campus who stand on principle and law. I am a black and white person most of the time as well. This doesn't mean. however, that I'm blind to the truth. 
First, I'd like to say that I'm addressing the minority here. I 
realize that most people on campus are in touch with reality and don't like to directly endanger the lives of their classmates or advocate a stance that does so. 
There are those few. however, like Zahm I !all H.A. Lenny DeLorenzo, who are con tent to support any stance which to them looks good on paper, espouses their sup· posedly elevated Catholic morals and aligns

itself with a law that they openly admit is completely ignored. 
When persons like this announce and support a drop in statis­tics ofon-campus emergency room trips, they are correct; exact­ly as was stated in last Friday's letter "Thanks Father Poorman." Those persons however, are sure to admit that drinking itself has not decreased -only the on-campus incidents. What does this mean? 
It means that those who were drinking on campus last year, and getting help, arc now ofT campus in the same situation, passed out on someone's floor. And while this may be considered a great thing to lazy H.A.·s who would prefer less work commen­surate with their free stay on campus, I feel it's pretty safe to assume it is not in the best interest of the campus as a whole. 
t\t some point. it becomes time to reconcile both reality and the law. EITorts to control on-campus drinking, not eliminate it, will meet with success. Unfortunately. I doubt anyone here would have the courage lo try an innovative program like an on-cam­pus student drinking license or the like. 
I do feel for the law-abiding claims of the morally self-right­eous. They are standing on a principle, something I have done many times in the past and will certainly do in the future. I think perhaps it is unfortunate that they do so at the peril ofnot just the social atmosphere, but the lives of their schoolmates. Perhaps it is a sacrifice they are willing to make. And who could fault them for following the lead of the Office of Student Affairs (OSA). 
This brings me around to the focal point of this controversy: The Office of Student Affairs and its affable leader. your very own, father Mark Poorman. Having neither received, nor expected, a response from the OSA last week, I would like to for­ward a response from an alumnus. a challenge to Father Poorman. The simple request is that ho provide "greater trans­parency with respect to the studies they have conducted and the basis for [his) decisions." What can it hurt? If the decision was based on an honest assessment ofstudents, using an honest measure of what is dangerous drinking activity, my argument is out the window. If it wasn't, well, hate to tell you, the cat's already out of the bag. 
The same man also asked me to "urge current students and alumni to write to the Board ofTrustees expressing their dissat­isfaction with the present situation (something considerably stronger [than what the] student body president presented)." But we all know how likely that is to happen. It would be nice if stu­dents would stand up for themselves in such a way, but I better move on to something that's feasible. 
This University operates on and for money -lots of it. One might even say it has been an overbearing focus of the adminis­tration starting with the Malloy presidency. Another alumnus recalled to me that in the past, Fathers "Joyce and Hesburgh used to rule the University by regularly asking one question, '!low will the students be affected by this?"' This isn't the case today. Administrators seem to be more concerned with the CSC, "cash, strictly cash" and volatile clergy politics than in what all their positioning is doing to students. 
The biggest weakness that I've been able to locate in the administration is their focus on greed. (Appeals to morality.jus­tice, safety and reality have simply been ignored.) It seems from my copious amount of responses, I was fairly far off the mark with my assessment last week that alumni agree with Poorman's policy. Most alumni from the early '70s forward seem to agree about the shortsightedness and danger of the Poorman hegemo­ny. Even the older alums seem split on the issue. For my part, should Poorman become the next University president, not a dime of' mine will find itself in the University coffers during his tenure. I'd suggest that students and alumni make the same pledge. 
John Litle is a senior MIS major who was shocked to learn he had to write a column for Friday on Thursday morning. He received 55 e-mails from alumni last Friday. Fifty-two agreed with his viewpoint.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
The fight for gay marriage 
This past Tuesday a landmark event happened in Massachusetts. After almost two years of prepara­tion. the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court heard the case ofGoodridge v. Department of Public Health, in which seven same-sex couples are arguing against the unequal marriage laws of Richard Massachusetts. If the justices Friedman rule in favor of the plaintiffs, it 
would pave the way to make A Skewed Massachusetts the second state to legally recognize a Perspective 
union between same-sex part­ners. 
The debate over same-sex unions has been rag­ing in various state and federal courts since 1993 when a male couple first challenged the marriage laws of Hawaii. The largest victory for gay right activists came in December of 1999 when the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that the state's mar­riage laws were unequal and ordered the state leg­islators to correct the inequalities. What resulted was the Vermont civil union which allowed the same state benefits, civil rights and protections to same-sex couples as to married couples. 
Recently, New Jersey has also been very much expression of love between two individuals. Two men or two women can love each other to the exact same extent that a man and a woman can, so how is it that the man and woman are following the ideal of marriage whereas the two men arc not? 
Looking more directly at legal marriage, this argument holds even less weight. 
Legal marriage has nothing to do with sexual activity between two people, but rather the vast majority of rights provided to legally married cou­ples are in terms oflegal protection, custody, med­ical decisions and inheritance. And while people often express disdain for people who legally marry only for these benefits. l have never heard of any­one proposing that we ban marriages of this sort. It is only when it come to homosexual couples that the idea of controlling who receives these benefits comes up. If two men love each other and plan to spend their whole lives together, the men should be afforded the same sort of legal rights that any het­erosexual couple receives. 
Another often used reason why same-sex couples should not be legally sanctioned is that by doing so we will be effectively undermining the whole idea 
of family as a unit with children. This is a 
-=~­

involved in court battles, as a case was filed seeking equal rights for gay and lesbian couples in June of 2002. Directly opposing these three states, 32 states including Hawaii have legally redefined marriage as only occurring between a man and a woman or specifically denied state protections to same-sex couples. 
This idea of banning civil unions or denying same-sex partners the same rights of legal protection as hetero­sexual couples is completely unaccept­able. As most recent­ly illustrated on a large scale by the tragic events of Sept. 11, not allowing for civil unions causes all kinds of unequal, unfair and unreason­able problems for homosexual people. Due to their lack of legal status, homosexu­al couples are unable to make all sorts of legal and medical decisions that heterosexual couples can make for each other. 
Why should a heterosexual person be allowed to make medical decisions for a partner to whom they have been married one year, whereas a homosexual person who has been together with his or her partner for over 20 years has no input? 
The arguments against civil unions have often been hollow or religiously based. And. while I am not at all against religion helping to shape our soci­·etal values and ideals, our Constitution is based on a separation of church and state. This is something that is often forgotten when it comes to homosexu­al partners. Many people agree with the separation of church and state as is evidenced by the recent rulings about removing the 1 O commandments from courthouses or by trying to remove "under God" from the pledge of allegiance, but then use religiously based argument,; to counter the idea of legalizing gay marriage. 
One of these arguments is the often stated idea that marriage is about procreation. This idea is obviously based in the religious ideas that sex is a part of consummating a marriage and that sex is about unity and procreation. 
Since a homosexual couple can not procreate, they cannot be married. But marriage is not just about sex. Instead, marriage is also about the 
rather outdated view, however, as the specific definition of a family contin­ues to change. It also falls apart when you consider that there are many married couples that have never had any 
intention of having chil­dren, but many homo­sexual couples that 
have raised children. A third argument is that homosexual 
couples lack lasting commitment to each other. Not 
only is this idea 
completely absurd, it is con­tradictory as well. How can you use an argu­ment that homo­sexual people show no real commitment to 
each other to 
argue that those same people should be denied 
the rights to have any sort of legally established and rec­ognized commitment? Providing an institu­

tion such as civil unions for homosexual couples would not only dispel this incorrect idea, it would help provide the couples with an . increased commitment to each other due to its public nature. Homosexual civil unions have been 
supported by three states as well as several other countries throughout the world. The fact that so many states have taken such direct efforts to contradict the efforts of some states towards pro­gression and equality is really unfortunate. Marginalizing and denying equal rights to some cit­izens is rather hypocritical for a country that claims to be about progression and equal rights for all. There is no difference between what two men or two women can feel for each other or the level of commitment they can have for each other, so there should be no reason why they cannot be afforded the same sorts of equal rights and protec­tions that arc available to heterosexual couples.

Theater has a large pool of resources for Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students. From a director's advice to elaborate costumes to a tip about theatre perform­ance, the Guthrie Theater will provide a new way for students to uncover the dif­ficult and various facets of live theatre. 
But on the eve of spring break it may be difficult to get the student body to trudge through the biting wind and brave the icy sidewalks on a trek to Washington Hall. Rathburn knows, how­ever, that there will still be a number of students on campus tonight. "Our chal­lenge is, how can we make sure every student takes advantage of this world class theatre?" he said. 
One way is to offer the tickets for only 
$7 to students and $18 for the general 
public. Another is to offer them a 
chance to see theatre's classic dramatic 
figures trade quips. 
''The Stuff of Dreams" will be per­formed tonight and Saturday at 7:30 
p.m. in Washington Hall. Tickets are on sale at the LaFortune Box Office.

By COLLEEN BARRETT Scene Writer 
Tonight at 7:30, five of Western the­ater's most famous characters will meet on the main stage of Washington Hall. 
In the Guthrie Theater's premier pro­duction tour of "The Stuff of Dreams," an original play by Bill Corbett, Notre Dame students and members of the sur­rounding community will experience an exchange between five recognizable dramatic figures. 
On an empty stage, the characters appear as if in a waking dream. The audience is led to believe that the dream has been conjured by the mysterious cloaked figure who acts as a host. The other four figures are the title charac­ters from Sophocles's "Antigone," Edmund Rostand's "Cyrano de Bergerac," Nora from Henrik Ibsen's "A Doll's House" and Willy Loman from Arthur Miller's "Death of a Salesman." 
The host challenges the four charac­ters to tell their individual stories in hopes of finding the most compelling, play-worthy life among them. 
Antigone is a headstrong teenager, uncompromising in her view of herself as history's most tragic figure. In his turn, Cyrano laments his unrequited love and his personal appearance, which has resulted in a life of indignity. Ibsen's Nora, who appears not as the woman in "A Doll's House," but the woman she became after she walked out on her life, claims no unusual power. However, the experts from the play and her own words reveal the strength it took this 19th century woman to walk away from her life and start over. Willy Loman approaches the mysterious host as he would a sales client, and throughout the evolution of his own tale, Loman realizes the consequences of spending his life chasing unrealistic expectations and unreasonable dreams. 
After the four characters have fin­ished telling their stories, the host reveals himself to be Shakespeare's Hamlet, and tells of his own tragic life. He claims that he has suffered as much as the other four, but the complications of his own situation make his story the most compelling. 
Throughout the play, the audience is under the impression that it is witness­ing the host's dream, but at the end of the play, one of the characters turns to the audiences and asks the others, "Who are they?" 
Suddenly, the audience realizes ­the dream is its own. 
"We're approaching the production very simply," said director Jeff Hall­Flavin. "Since theatre is a very human art form, the emphasis is on the actors ­they're featured by stripping away everything except the essentials. The hope is that this will engage the audi­ence as active participants." 
The Guthrie Theater's hope to have an active audience isn't simply a dream. Invited by Summer Shakespeare's founder and Artistic Director Paul Rathburn, the men and women of the Guthrie Theater attended classes yester­day to provide insight about the stage to students. 
Summer Shakespeare is a sponsor of the Guthrie Theater, ensuring that South Bend is a regular stop for the company's performances. Besides offering their expertise in the classroom, the Guthrie

SAN ANTONIO 

The San Antonio Spurs had a high roller's dream night Thursday against the New .forscy Nets. 
Tim Duncan. who wears No.

Tho win was San Antonio's 17th in its last 21 games. 
The Nets, who lost their fifth in six games. cut the Spurs' margin to 83-77 with 
1:41 left on consecutive jumpers by Jason Collins and Kenyon Martin. But San Antonio finished with a 9-1 run capped by a 3-pointcr by Duncan at tho final buzzer after New Jersey, the out­co11w assured, stopped play ing defense. 
The Spurs, who allowed l'honnix Lo shool 59 percent in a loss Tuesday, limited the Nets to 36.6 percent from the 11oor. 
Jason Kidd, guarded mostly by the 20-ycar-old Parker, shot 4-for-19 for 11 points, about hair his season aver­agu, but he uxceeded his norm with 13 assists. 
"If the ball is not going in, you have to find another aspect of your game," said Kidd, whose name tops the list of potential free agents the Spurs might pursue in the offscason. 
The Spurs certainly would 
like to roll the right numbers with Kidd. But on the ques· tion of free agency and the Spurs. Kidd tried to rein in the chatter and at the same time teased reporters, saying "you guys have kind of taken it overboard, but we'll see what happens come July 1," the date his current contract expires. 
Reserve Manu Ginobili scored 18 points for the Spurs, and he energized his Learn with seven assists and five steals. 
"Ile has rnally been a spark for us and just is fun to watch," Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said of the rookie from Argentina. "Sometimes he scares me out there, because I don't know what is coming, but he is so creative and we have to give him that freedom to just make things happen." 
Ginobili, who has scored in double figures in four of the past five games, said. "Tonight just felt very easy out there." 
Bruce Bowen had 11 points and Stephen Jackson 10 for San Antonio. 
David 1-lobinson left in the third quarter with a strained lower back, an injury that has plagued him all season. He scored eight points and had five rebounds in 24 minutes.

The teams stayed close through most of the second period before an 11-footer by Duncan began a 10-3 burst that put San Antonio up 40· 32 about a minute before the break. 
Aaron Williams made a layup with 7.3 seconds left in the half, and then Kidd stole the inbounds pass and got the ball to Kittles for a 17-foot jumper at the buzzer, draw­ing the Nets to 40-36. 
Kidd made only two of his 11 shots in the half, while Martin went 3-for-9. Duncan secured his double-double early by scoring 10 points and grabbing 14 rebounds in the first two quarters. 
San Antonio got its lead over 10 points late in the third period and kept it there most of the way. 
Bulls 119, Warriors 105 
Eddy Curry had 24 points and 10 rebounds as the Chicago Bulls beat Golden State and snapped the Warriors' six-game winning streak. 
The Bulls' victory was just their fifth in the last 19 games, but gave them 22 wins -one more than last season. 
Curry's fellow prep-to-pro teammate Tyson Chandler added 23 points and 14 rebounds as the Bulls scored their most points this season following controversial state­ments by rookie guard Jason Williams. 
Williams said Monday the team needed to shake things 

up, suggested there was a rift between players and coaches and hinted maybe it was time some players move on ­maybe even him. He started the game on the bench. 
Jamal Crawford was in the starting lineup in his place, although Chicago coach Bill Cartwright said before the game Williams was not being punished for airing his gripes. 
Crawford had 15 points and a career-high 10 assists in 31 minutes, while Williams scored nine points with three assists in 17 minutes. Jalen Rose scored all 21 of his points in the second half. 
Gilbert Arenas scored 28 to lead Golden State and Antawn Jamison added 22. 
Leading by five at the half, the Bulls ran out to 16-point lead after three quarters, get­ting a pair of 3-pointers from Donyell Marshall and one each from Crawford and Rose. 
But the Warriors turned to their bench and scored the first seven points of the fourth quarter to make it 88­79 with just under 10 minutes remaining. 
Then Williams and Rose hit jumpers as the Bulls regained control and pulled away again to break a three-game losing streak. 
With Golden State center Erick Dampier in early foul trouble, Curry and Chandler went to work. Curry scored 19 points and Chandler had 12 points and 12 rebounds in the first half.

IN BRIEF 
Bulls bench Williams 
In the first game since he called for the Chicago Bulls to shake things up, Jay Williams was part of the change -he was taken out of the starting lineup. 
Jamal Crawford made the start Thursday night as part of a lineup shuffle that also included Danyell Marshall replacing Trenton Hassell for the game against the Golden State Warriors. 
After Monday night's loss to Orlando when he went scoreless, Williams said the Bulls needed to spice up their approach, suggested there was a rift between players and the coaching staff and hinted that maybe some players needed to move on, maybe even him. 
Bulls coach Bill Cartwright said Thursday that Williams was not taken out of the starting lineup as punish­ment for airing his gripes. 
"I think Jamal has played good," Cartwright said. 
"I feel like this is our best group.... I'd like to come out with more thrust." 
Cartwright said he talked Thursday morning with Williams, the No. 2 pick overall in last year's draft. 
"All Jay has to do is play, play the way he has his whole life," Cartwright said. 
"He needs to play and not worry about things." 
Before Thursday, Williams had started 51 of the 55 games in which he had played. Crawford was making just his 12th start in 61 games. 
In other moves announced Thursday, the Bulls activated center Dalibor Bagaric and placed forward Eddie Robinson on the injured list because of a pulled right hamstring that has kept him out of the last six games. 
The 7-foot-1, 290 pound Bagaric has scored six points and grabbed 10 rebounds in four games this season. He was the Bulls' third first-round pick in the 2000 draft. 
Robinson has started nine of the 53 games he has played in this season. The 6-9, 210-pounder has averages of 
5.7 points a game and 3.1 rebounds.

Pyatl gave the Sabres a 2-1 lead late in the second period when he took a pass from Dmitri Kalinin in the left faceoff circle, skated in and beat Belfour between the legs for his eighth goal. It was Pyatt's first goal since Jan. 24 -also against Toronto. 
The Maple Leafs opened the scoring 1:46 into the second period when Corson redirected Wade Belak's centering pass past Biron for his seventh goal. 
Buffalo tied it less than three minutes later when Satan's weak wrist shot from the point deflected off Alexander Mogilny and past Belfour for his team­leading 24th goal. 
Toronto -without penalty minutes leaders Tie Dami and Darcy Tucker because of sus­pensions -didn't lack for toughness. 
After Bryan McCabe checked Adam Mair into the boards early in the first period, Rob Hay fought Alexei Ponikarovsky. 
Less than three minutes later, McCabe and Mair battled, and 31 seconds later Corson and Chris Gratton fought. Five sec­onds after, Belak and Eric Boulton tussled. 
In the second period Belak, dropped his gloves and punched Boulton, and both were assessed minors. 
Biron finished with 31 saves. 
Bclfour had 22. 
Blue Jackets S, Canucks 4 

Hick Nash thought he might have breached the rules of sportsmanship by celebrating too much after his first over­time goal in the NHL. 
Nash scored on a breakout to hand Vancouver its first over­time loss as the Columbus Blue Jackets beat the Canucks. 
"I think I got a little too excit­ed, but that's all right," Nash said with a grin. "It's an excit­ing moment and the guys were really happy." 
Vancouver. which had leads of 2-0 and 3-2, was 5-0-10 in overtime before Nash scored with 2:58 remaining in the extra period. Columbus was just 1-2-7 beyond regulation. 
No wonder the Blue Jackets were piled on Nash and cele­brated as if they had just won their division instead of escaped last place in the West. 
"With the Vancouver Canucks, one thing you don't want to do is get into a shootout," said Ray Whitney. who had two goals and an assist for the Blue Jackets. "You've got two of the best for­wards in the league. Tonight we had timely goals, the power play was working really well and what can I say about Rick Nash? That's one hell of a goal, especially on this ice late in the game. To be able to make that move, it's going to be exciting for people here in Columbus for a few years, that's for sure." 
Columbus defense man Jaroslav Spacek, who had a goal and two assists. passed from the defensive circle and hit Nash in stride near the Vancouver blue line. Nash, the No. 1 overall pick in last sum­mer's draft, swooped in on goaltender Alexander Auld while defenseman Marek Malik and trying to make too many pretty plays -not grind it out and play our game plan." 
Hurricanes 4, Penguins 0 
Jeff O'Neill scored Carolina's first two goals and the Hurricanes ended a two-month road winless streak by beating the reeling Pittsburgh Penguins. 
The Hurricanes came into the game with an NHL-low 51 points, but had an easy time with a Penguins team that has tumbled into the league's bot­tom five even with Hall of Farner Mario Lemieux in the lineup. 
The Penguins lost their sev­enth straight, and fourth in a row at home, during a streak that is beginning to resemble their 10-game winless run that tried to slow him down with his stick. Nash waited until Auld committed before putting the puck over Auld's right shoulder for his 14th goal. 

Asked where the goal ranked in his young career, Nash said, "It's up there. Obviously, my first goal in the NHL was really exciting. But this goal is up there. I think the bigger thing was getting the team a win. That's the main thing, the two points." 
Todd Bertuzzi and Markus Naslund each had a goal and an assist and Sarni Salo had two assists for the Canucks, who are live points ahead of Colorado in the Northwest Division and two points behind Dallas for best record in the West. 
"I think we invited them back into the game," Naslund said. "We had a lead there. If we would have just kept on going and played disciplined, I think we would have been all right. It's

ended last season. 
Lemieux began the night tied with Vancouver's Markus Naslund for the NHL scoring lead with 85 points, but was held scoreless for the second straight game and the third time in five games. 
Carolina was 0-11-2-2 on the road since a 4-2 win at Boston on Jan. 4 and had lost five in a row overall. The Hurricanes, Stanley Cup finalists a year ago, had won only three times since Dec. 22 and had scored only five goals in their previous five games. 
It got so bad for Pittsburgh shortly after Kevyn Adams' sev­enth goal made it 4-0, the Hurricanes spent nearly the entire second half of the period on a nine-minute power play resulting from Ville Nieminen's

The Hurricanes had a two­man advantage for the first two minutes of the lengthy power play as Steve McKenna also was sent off for instigating and fighting, but did not score. 
O'Neill gave the Hurricanes the only goals they needed, tak­ing advantage of Richard Lintner's giveaway on an intended clearing pass to score at 2:34 of the first. The pass deflected off Ron Francis' skate directly to O'Neill, who wristed it into an open net as goalie Sebastien Caron couldn't scramble back in time to defend.

Irish grab first home win 
By JOE LINDSLEY 
Spores Writer 
The Irish finally won their first home match of this season after going undefeated at the Eck Pavilion last year. 
No. 46 Notre Dame defeated No. 57 Michigan 5-2 Thursday, and the Irish are showing signs of improved confidence as t.hey prepare for the talent-laden Blue/Gray National Classic over spring break. 
The momentum that put the Irish ahead 4-0 to clinch the vic­tory was initiated by the claim­ing of the doubles point. Each of Michigan's points came only when the score did not matter. 
''We got off to a good start in doubles," sophomore Luis Haddock said. "That kind of kept us going. We haven't won at home. It was finally huge that we could win [the way we did]." 
While the No. 1 Irish doubles team lost, the bottom two, which have at times been points of concern for the team, ensured that Notre Dame would start the match with the initial point on the board. 
Junior Nicolas Lopez-Acevedo and sophomore Paul McNaughton won at the No. 3 light, 8-5, over the Wolverines' Anthony Jackson and Josef Fischer. Lopez-Acevedo and McNaughton have not competed together in match play since Jan. 26. After their win, junior Brian Farrell and Haddock, both Irish captains, defeated Vinny Gossain and Chris Shaya, 8-6. 
"It feels good," McNaughton said. "It's a new feeling for us, especially at the No. 3 doubles, because we haven't done very well at that position. It really felt good to win one." 
Although sophomore Brent D'Amico and junior Matt Scott lost at the No. 1 light, the team was comforted by the fact that the other duos were able to come through on a day when the best were not at their best. 
"That's a great sign," Scott said. 'Tm really proud of [McNaughton] and [Lopez­Acevedo]. They fought hard. They came up big when they needed to. It's a big confidence booster when you can't bring your 'A' game and you have your two other teams to back you up. They saw that they were capable of playing well and playing with big teams. and I think that gave them some con­fidence." 
The Irish believe that their participation in the Pacific Coast doubles tournament last week­end gave the doubles lineup some valuable experience and practice time, which seems to have served as a confidence booster. 
In singles play. D'Amico notched his first victory in almost a month with his 6-2, 6-1 win over Shaya. D'Amico began the spring season 6-0 before he lost two consecutive matches and missed a third due to injury. Overall, D'Amico, who was 1-3 last spring, has been an impor­tant asset to the young Irish squad. 
Other key assets are starting to emerge for Notre Dame. 
Lopez-Acevedo, a transfer from Bowling Green, came through with a 6-3 win in straight sets over Gossain. The junior has won four of his past six singles matches. 
A freshman clinched the day's win for Notre Dame. Patrick Buchanan, who has won five of his past six matches. topped Michigan's Fischer 7-5, 6-3. 
Haddock, ranked 88th nation­ally, was upset by No. 101 Michael Rubin, 7-6 (7-4), 6-1, which gave the Wolverines a futile point. The Irish junior cap­tain was injured during the match, but the condition is not serious. Haddock's doubles partner Farrell also lost, 7-5, 6­
3. The team's third captain, Scott, won the final match on the court, and showed his excitement with a little celebra­tion after he finally triumphed over Michgan's Anthony Jackson, 6-1, 4-6, 1-0 (10-8). Jackson defeated Scott last fall, and the Irish player was eager for revenge. 
Over spring break, Notre Dame will compete for the pres­tigious green blazers awarded to the victors of the Blue/Gray National Tennis Classic in Montgomery, Ala. Two years ago the Irish won the green, and last year they advanced to the finals. 
Overall, the team is looking forward to playing outdoors. and with trips to Miami and Dallas approaching after the break, they won't have to count on South Bend weather to get a chance to leave the indoor courts. 
"Definitely I think we'll have a little better outdoor team," Haddock said. 
Scott thinks the Irish are already a little better, though. 
"I think we'll do fme adjusting outdoors," Scott said. "I think [Thursday's win] is a good step­ping stone to turning our season around today."

losing streak three other times. 
However, unlike last week­end where the Irish faced two top-20 teams in three days, none of Notre Dame's six oppo­nents that they will face during 
spring break has a national  
ranking.  
After  facing  the  

Commodores. the Irish will meet host North Florida Sunday, followed Monday by the first of two games against Navy. 
The Irish get a day off Tuesday before resuming the series against Jacksonville Wednesday evening, and play­ing Eastern Illinois Thursday. 
Notre Dame closes out the series next Friday and Saturday with the second match against the Midshipmen and a meeting with Creighton. 
The Blue Jays are the only team of the six opponents which the Irish faced last year. The two teams split the two to have a winning record against Notre Dame (2-1). 

The Irish have historically been known to get off to slow starts. Notre Dame opened the 2002 campaign with a 9-10 record before earning a trip to the College World Series. 
In order for the Irish to break out of their slump, they will need to rely more on the offen­sive firepower that was severe­ly lacking at the Metrodome last weekend. After averaging over six runs per game in the opening four-game series in Arizona, the Irish scored only five runs in three games against some stellar pitching. 
In addition, the Irish pitching corps must step up. They will need to improve on their team ERA of 7 .23 and to lower their opponents' batting average, which is currently .317.

Irish hope to sparkle in the southern sun 
By JOE LINDSLEY Sporis Writer 
The Irish wit! be spending spring break in Tempe, but before that they will travel to Provo, Utah, where they will take on No. 49 Brigham Young. 
After a week of practicing under the Tempe sun. Notre Dame will then take on No. 7 Arizona State. 
The Irish expect a tough fight this Saturday. 
"!Brigham Young! is a team that always lights to the very end in every single spot of their lineup," Irish senior Katie Cunha said. "I think they have a little bit of the home-court advantage being in the !high] altitude." 
The No. 19 Irish earned their lirst upset victory of the season lasl weekend when they defeated No. 13 Texas. and the team is planning on carrying the momen­tum from that win into Saturday's match. 
"If we play like we did last week­end. we should win," Cunha said. 
After Brigham Young, Notre Dame will spend the rest of break in Arizona. 
"We're just going to get down there to Tempe and practice hard all week, just get used to the out­door courts and the weather and then play some ball on Friday," Cunha said. 
One of the best parts of traveling to Arizona State, according to Cunha, is non-tennis related. 
"First of all, we're looking for­ward io getting out of the weath­er," she said. 
Other than that though, the Irish are excited for the opportunity to do battle with a top-ten power 
At about the midway point in the season, the Irish are making advancements despite their chal­lenging schedule. 
"I think we've had some hard­fought matches," Cunha said. "I really think that our doubles are coming together. All the girls played solid last weekend. I think everything is starting to come together for us." 
Although tho. team is relatively young, the Irish arc slowly gaining importance experience. 
"The freshmen are starting to get used to the individual match­es," Cunha said. "We're getting a little more comfortable with our lineup. I think we're getting pretty good right now."

Irish still green as spring season gets under way 
By ERIK POWERS Sports Writer 
The fall season had an inauspicious start for the Irish. At the Inverness Intercollegiate Invitational, the team finished 14th out of 15 teams and 46 strokes behind tournament champion Florida. But freshman Eric Deutsch turned in a positive performance, entering the third day in fifth place before fading late. 
Deutsch's performance was 

a microcosm of the fall sea­s on. The Irish have been starting strong and then tail­ing off. In four of its five fall meets, the team has posted its best overall score in the open­ing round. By the end of the fall season the squad had fin­ished in the top half of tour­naments three times, peaking at 5th of 14 teams at the SMU Stonebridge Invitational. 
Tomorrow marks the dawn of the spring season for the Irish. Like the fall, the team will be especially green. 
Freshmen Scott Gustafson, 
Tommy Balderston and Deutsch have competed in all five tournaments this year and appear to be the core of the team for the remainder of the season. Fellow freshman Mark Baldwin, who battled mononucleosis last semester, was in four tournaments and his 11th place finish with a 211 was the fourth-lowest 54­hole score ever by a Notre Dame golfer. Senior captain Brandon Lunke anchors the squad with a team-best 73.33 average. 
Because of improved sched­
uJe-making at the request of coach John Jasinski, the Irish participate in two different tournaments over spring break than last year. This Saturday and Sunday, the Irish invade Ocala, Fla. with eyes set on a championship against a wide-open field. Lamar won the championship by three strokes over Michigan State last year, but while the Spartans return to the Big Red Classic, the Cardinals will not.

The next two weeks afford the Irish an opportunity to shed the rust from four months away from competi­tion. While the team has been far from dormant, the South Bend winter has deprived the Irish the luxury of daily course play above freezing temperatures.

Irish look to exorcise last year's demons 
By AARON RONSHEIM Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame softball team (6-6) has a chance this weekend to exorcise some of last year's demons when they face No. 3 Nebraska at the Kia Classic during spring break. Last year the Cornhuskers ended Notre Dame's season with a 5-3 victory over the Irish in the regional final. A win would have given Notre Dame its first ever berth in the College Softball World Series. 
"They know how much it hurt to lose that game at regionals last year," Irish coach Deanna Gumpf said. "I think that the girls' emotion will take care of itself in this game." 
Besides the past team history on the field, which included a Notre Dame victory at Nebraska last season. Gumpf has a personal relationship with the Cornhuskcrs. Gumpf played for Nebraska from 1989-1992 and would want nothing more than a win against her alma mater. 
"I don't think I need to say much about this game," Gumpf said. "The girls know that Nebraska is a tough team and they know how I feel about them." 
The Cornhuskers are 12-1 this season, with their only loss coming against No. 1 UCLA. They've also defeated seven ranked teams. 
The Cornhuskers have an explosive offense. boosting a .337 team batting average. Leading the explosive attack is senior outfielder Lisa Wangler, who is batting .432 with five home runs and 20 runs batted in. 
In order to shut down the Cornhusker offense, the Irish will need their young pitching staff to step up. Inconsistency has been the biggest worry for Gumpf and her coaching staff, but she is hoping that will improve soon. 
"Our pitching needs to be more consistent," said Gumpf. "I think we are ready in every other area, and I think we are very close to where we need to be." 
To keep pace with the Nebraska offense, Notre Dame will have to continue the offen­sive tear they were on last weekend in Louisiana. The Irish hit 10 homeruns and pounded out 45 hits in their last five games. With the offense back in gear. some of the pressure is taken off the pitching staff. 
"It relaxes you," pitcher Steffany

Fennell is 6-2 in homeruns and has raised her the young season and has an average from .111 to .306 over impressive 2.10 ERA. At the plate, Fennell is equally impressive with a team leading 14 RBI and a .413 batting aver· age. 
Besides facing Nebraska at the Kia Classic the Irish will take the field against Fresno State and DePaul in round robin play before starting tour­nament play. 
Against Fresno State (4-8), the Irish will likely face Bulldog pitcher Jamie Southern. Even though Southern is 3-5 this season, she boosts an excellent 
0.61 ERA and has struck out 
79 batters in 59 innings. The DePaul Blue Demons (6­

(3-0, 0.90 ERA). 

"Against DePaul we have to play solid and hit the ball well," Gumpf said. "They have two good pitchers. We can't make mistakes against a team like DePaul. They are very aggressive and will capitalize on our mistakes."

Belles looking for fresh start with new coach 
By PAT LEONARD Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's softball team will travel to Fort Myers, Fla. this week to play 11 games in four days beginning Sunday, March 9. 
Behind first-year coach Anna Welsh, the Belles will open the season away in hopes of growing accustomed to each other and to the new staff. 
Last year, the Belles went 4­4 on the trip, defeating Drew University, 4-0, Salve Regina University, 4-2 and Bentley University. 4-0 and 8-2. respectively. 
Only Salve Regina and Transylvania University return to the Belles' schedule from last year.

coaching style and a confident attitude. 
Welsh will not have much help from upperclassmen, either. Only one senior returns to the Belles' squad, catcher Susan Kutz. Libby Wilhelmy, Kate Sajewich, Katie Amick and Bridget Grall will anchor the Belles pitching staff. 
Amick will be a key team member, as she is the only player for the Belles who bats left-handed. Welsh could use her in key hitting situations. 
The roster includes nine freshmen, no sophomores. five juniors and Kutz. Freshman third baseman Meghan Marenkowic will probably start for the Belles and numer­ous other freshmen will start or split time with juniors. 
Welsh, who also first got into coaching by becoming the stu­dent assistant coach her senior ye_ar at Olivet Nazarene, has since coached at Nazarene, Notre Dame and Bethel College summer softball camps. Assistants Don Miller and John Antonucci hope to help Welsh develop a young but solid core of softball play­ers into a competitive MIAA program.

Irish must face test in early season game 
By PAT LEONARD 
Spom W rirer 
The last time the mens lacrosse team opened a season 5-0, the squad advanced to the 2001 NCAA Final Four. 
To reach that goal this season, the Irish must win at No. 12 North Carolina Saturday. The No. 11 Irish (2-0) will then face two more top 15 teams in a seven-day span. 
While Notre Dame knows it will have to work for a win in every con­test, the team is testing itself early in what head coach Kevin Corrigan hopes to be a repeat of two seasons ago. 
"I don't think we're going to see any tea.ms this talented on the same trip [again]," Corrigan said. "In these three straight games we will find out a lot about ourselves." 
Notre Dame will face No. 12 NortJ1 Carolina and No. 1 Virginia on the road and No. 8 Loyola at home. Last season, the Irish dropped a close 7 -5 contest to Virginia and a 7-6 nail-biter to Loyola. 
This season, however. the Irish have started with two solid wins over two solid programs. Notre Dame beat now No. 13 Penn State on the road 10-9 and blew out Ivy League opponent Penn at the Loftus Sports Center, 14-5. Junior Matt llowell had three goals and two assists against the Quakers, fresh­man Patrick Walsh had two goals and three assists and freshman Matt Karwcck scored three goals in a game that featured an impressive, even distribution of points across tJ1c roster. 
Now, the Irish will face a North Carolina squad that has played in just as many games but has a few more battle scars to show for it. The Tar IIeels lost in quadruple over­time to Navy in i1s season opener, and then defeated Bucknell to move to 1-1. North Carolina has been tested, as have Virginia (2-0) and Loyola (3-0). Virginia beat Syracuse 16-15 last weekend and sit tied atop the rankings with Johns Hopkins, a team that defeated then-second ranked Princeton, 10-8. Loyola took care of Hofstra, 10-4. 
"Anytime you play teams that are as talented as them, you have got to establish what you are and aren't going to do and try to impose the style and tempo that is most com­fortable to your team," Corrigan said. "We'll see if we're ready to do that." 
Notre Oame hopes to continue to get scoring from all over. particular­ly from the impressive freshman class that has emerged early on. 
"We're young but we like the way we've been playing," Corrigan said. "We have to be careful not to let the tempo get away from us and see if we can play with enough discipline to do that." 
Notre Dame's match against Virginia, originally scheduled to be played at either Klockner Stadium or on the U-Hall Turf Field in Virginia, has been moved to Charlottesville, Va .. and will be played on Tuesday at 3:30 p.m. 
Notre Dame will be in action in North Carolina Saturday at 1 p.m.

 Men hope to add more quali­fiers to NCAA 
By LISA REIJULA Sports Writer 
With this season's confer­ence meets completed, colle­giate track and field teams across the nation now have the NCAA Championship as their goal. 
Notre Dame will host the Alex Wilson Invitational this Friday and Saturday in Loftus Fieldhouse. The Invitational is unique, a "last chance" meet for athletes looking to qualify for the NCAA Championships, held in Fayetteville, Ark., on March 14 and 15. 
Teams will be sending between one and 10 mem­bers to the Invitational to either improve their qualifi­cation times or post their first qualification. The Loftus track is considered fast, so many teams are hoping their athletes will reach an auto­matic time and qualify.

In what some may deem as one of the "last chance" meets in the nation, hun­dreds of the nation's best track and field athletes will compete this Friday and Saturday at the Alex Wilson Invitational at Loftus Sports Center. 
With the Big East confer­ence meet over after a sec­ond-place finish, the Notre Dame women's track team looks to qualify more ath­letes for the NCAA Championship. 
Senior pole vaulter Jaime Volkmer cleared 4.00 meters to earn a Big East individual championship, and is cur­rently 19th on the NCAA list. Teammates Laura Huarte and Jill VanWeedlen join her, as they look to clear

should prove to be more exciting than the average meet, as every race repre­sents a chance to make it to the Championship. Races will be close, with the top athletes from across the country vying for a qualify­ing time. 
For the Irish. some ath­letes have already qualified for the Championship, while others arc looking to make their mark this weekend. 
Sophomore hurdler Selim Nurudeen will be in the hunt for a qualifying time in the 60-meter event. Ranked 24th on the NCAA descending order list, his best time this season is 7.83. At this year's conference meet, Nurudeen placed second and was awarded all-Big East honors. 
On Friday evening, the men's distance medley relay team will seek an NCAA qualification time in their event. The automatic time of 
9:36.05 is within the reach of the team, made up of Eric Morrison, Ryan Postel, Thomas Chamney and Luke Watson. 
Watson already qualified for the NCAA Championship.

In the high jump, All-Big East volleyball player Emily Loomis looks to qualify for her second-career NCAA Championship, as she is cur­rently 19th on the NCAA lists. 
In what promises to be a competitive race, the women's mile includes Lauren King, who has already qualified in the 3,000 meters. Teammate Molly Huddle is fourth in the 3,000 meters, and looks to qualify in the mile as well. 
Freshman Petra Dankova, an all-Big East performer in the triple jump, looks to improve on her ranking of 33rd, as she looks for an automatic qualifying jump. 
In the 5,000 meters, Jennifer Handley hopes to make the cut as well, as she competed in the 2002 NCAA outdoor meet in the 10,000 meters. 
Finally, Tiffany Gunn, 

A proven leader for the men's team, Watson's victo­ry in the Meyo Mile earned him a spot in Sports Illustrated's "Faces in the Crowd" this week. 
Watson won a Big East Championship in the mile while recorq ing the best mile time of the collegiate indoor season with his 
3:57.83 effort. He has quali­fied for both the mile and 3,000 meters, an event in which he is ranked fifth in the nation. It has not yet been determined which event Watson will run at the NCAA meet. This weekend Watson will run the anchor leg of the DMR with the goal of earning a spot in the NCAA field. 
Irish teammate Morrison will look to join Watson in the mile event. The sopho­more post9d a strong time of 
4:01.90 in the Meyo Mile, a performance that ranks him 19th in the country.

Kristen Dodd, Kymia Love and Ayesha Boyd look to qualify in the 4x440 relay. Dodd, Love and Boyd have the experience necessary, as all three earned All-America honors in this relay just a year ago. 
Notre Dame also has a few athletes who have already secured spots in the field. 
Huddle and King both have qualified for the 3,000 meters, with Huddle holding the school record. 
Another school-record holder, long jumper Tameisha King, has already qualified, as she is 12th in the NCAA. 
The Irish as a team look to send as many athletes to Fayetteville as possible, despite the stiff competition the Alex Wilson Invitational proves to provide. The meet starts at 7 p.m. on Friday and carries over to 1 p.m. Saturday at Loftus Sports Center.

Irish keeping playoff hopes alive this weekend 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER Sports Writer 
Assuming everything goes according to plan, the Irish hope to return to something more than books and tests when spring break nears its end. 
They hope to return home for a play­off game. 
With a good showing against Northern Michigan on the road this weekend, that hope could change into a reality. 
Currently, the Irish sit tied for fifth place in the CCHA along with three other teams, one of which is Northern Michigan. 
If the Irish (14-14-6, 12-11-3 CCHA) can collect at least three points against the Wildcats. they will be in a good posi­tion to secure home ice for the first round of the playoffs. The top six fmish­ers in the league receive home ice. 
A month ago, an Irish bid for home ice appeared almost impossible, with Notre Dame, at one point, standing as low as ninth place in the 12-team con­ference. Since the start of February, a surge has seen the Irish win five of their last seven and has put the team in posi­tion to earn the home ice advantage. 
Last weekend, the Irish split a home­and-home series with Western Michigan, in which the home team won each contest. The Broncos defeated the Irish 4-2 on Friday in Kalamazoo, but the Irish responded with a 5-2 win Saturday at the Joyce Center. 
In Saturday's game, on Senior Night, senior goaltender Tony Zasowski and freshman Matt Amado were the heroes. Zasowski, making "'just his fifth start of the season, stopped 25 of 27 shots, and Amado scored the eventual game-win­ning goal. 

The other seniors aided the team in its victory as well. Evan Nielsen assisted on Amado's goal, Connor Dunlop and John Wroblewski scored the insurance goals, Michael Chin assisted on Dunlop's goal and Jake Wiegand start­ed his first game at defense for the first time in his Irish career. 
The seniors and the rest of the Irish are in for a tough test when they travel to Marquette, Mich., to take on the Wildcats (17-15-2, 13-12-1 CCHA). The Wildcats are coming off last weekend having achieved a split against Ohio State in Marquette. 
Following an impressive 5-2 win over the Buckeyes on Friday, the Wildcats lost by a score of 4-1 the following Saturday. 
A pair of talented senior forwards lead Northern Michigan offensively. Chris Gobart leads the team with 37 points, including 10 goals, while Mike Stutzel is right behind with 36 points and an impressive 23 goals, good enough for third in the CCHA. 
The Wildcats are led in net by junior Craig Kowalski, who holds a respectable 2. 77 GM for the season. Kowalski usually doesn't have to work too hard, as he plays behind a defense that only gives up an average of 27.2 shots a game. By contrast, the Irish give up an average of33.7 shots a game. 
If there's a strength for the WIidcats, it's their special teams. They are ranked in the top five in the CCHA in both power play and penalty kill percentage, and have yet to give up a shorthanded goal while scoring three of their own.

FENCING 
Irish hope to qualify for toUTI1ey 
ByMATTLOZAR 
Sports Editor 
If they want a chance at 
their first national title since 
1994, then Saturday is a very 
important day for the Irish. 
Notre Dame looks to quali­
fy 12 fencers for the NCM 
Championships at Saturday's 
Midwest Regional 
Championship at Ohio State 
University. 
"Our goal is to qualify as 
many as we can. Our goal is 
to qualify 12 which will be 
hard and not easy," Notre 
Dame coach Janusz 
Bednarski said. "For us it is 
easier to get the better 
results if we have a full 12­
fencer team." 
To automatically qualify for 
the national championships, 
a fencer must finish in the 
top four at the regional com­
petition in his or her respec­
tive weapon. A formula is 
used to determine the final 
standings by combining regu­
lar season performance with . the finish at the regionals. 
Each school can qualify a 
maximum of two fencers at a 
weapon on the mens and 
womens side. 
Four berths at each 
weapon are allotted to the 
Midwest Region because of 
the low number of schools in 
the area. With the strength of 
the schools in the region, 
especially Notre Dame and 
Ohio State, some fencers will 
be left out because of the 
numbers game. 
"Our region is stronger 
with Ohio State having high­class fencers so the competi­tion is growing," Bednarski said. "It's a political reason because we should get more spots in the region due to the strength. It is based on the number of schools, so we can't increase the number of spots. I think it is wrong and we should have the ratio that if you are stronger. you are better." 
At last year's regional com­petition, the Irish qualified 11 fencers automatically and had to wait for sabre Matt Fabricant to earn an at-large bid to give the Irish a com­plete squad at the NCAA Championships. 
Bednarski believes the biggest challenge for the Irish this year will be at womens sabre, which has been their weakest weapon so far this season. Junior captain Destanic Milo qualified for the past two NCAA Championships while junior Maggie Jordan qualified for the 2001 NCAA Championships at foil as a freshman. 
"Destanie Milo and Maggie Jordan have to give every­thing, have a good day and have a little luck to qualify for nationals," Bednarski said. "Womens sabre will be the key for us, but we are trying hard." 
The Irish got good news with both Milo and Jordan being seeded in the top four of the region. 
Mens epeeists Jan Viviani and Michal Sobieraj, womens epeeists Anna Carnick and Kerry Walton and womens foilists Alicja Kryczalo and Andrea J\ment should quaWy easily for this year's NCAA Championships. 
At mens sabre, seniors Gabor Szelle and Fabricant will face tough competition from the Ohio State sabre team, but have a very good chance at qualifying. 
The biggest internal battle for the Irish comes at mens foil. Senior captain Ozren Debic has the top seed and wrapped up one spot, but the other spot is up for grabs between senior fourth-seed­ed Forest Walton and sec­ond-seeded sophomore Derek Snyder. 
Walton qualified for the NCM Championships as a freshman and earned All­American honors as a sopho­more before spending last season studying abroad. As a freshman, Snyder finished seventh and was a second team All-American. 
Despite dropping the con­ference championship last weekend to the Buckeyes, the Irish feel confident heading into this weekend's impor­tant regional competition. 
"According to the current seeding, we have a chance," Bednarski said. "If we have strong results, that should elevate us to qualify 12."

Streaking Irish look to make waves 

Irish center Teresa Borton shoots a layup In Notre Dame's most recent matchup with Pittsburgh. The lrlsh and Panthers face off tomorrow night. 
By JOE HETTLER Sports Editor 
Sixth-seeded Notre Dame is playing their best basketball at the right time of the season as they head into the their first round Big East Tournament game against No. 11 seed Pittsburgh Saturday at 8 p.rn. · 
The Irish, winners of seven of their last nine. are looking forward to the challenges awaiting them in Piscataway, 

,. N.J. "We're playing well right now and we're building momentum," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said. " 7-2 in our last nine, 
Notre Dame beat Pittsburgh Feb. 26 77 -69. The Panthers are making their first Big East tournament appearance in three years and are 0-12 all-time against the Irish. The winner of the game will face No. 3 seed Villanova Sunday at 8 p.m. The Irish already defeated the Wildcats earlier this season on Jan. 25, 58-56. 
But right now, McGraw is more con­cerned about getting past the Panthers than looking ahead.

when we needed it," McGraw said. "Now we're just waiting for everyone to have a good game at the same time." Senior guard Alicia Ratay has been the spark plug for Notre Dame's recent run. The Lake Zurich, Ill., product has made big shots when the Irish have needed it the most. "She has really taken the load off of everybody else," McGraw said. "She's done a great job. We've done a good job of getting her the ball, too. She's always been there when we've needed a buck­et." Now the Irish hope to delve deep into the conference tournament. Awaiting them is a familiar foe in Pittsburgh. 
"If you beat 
[Villanova] that's 
great, but if you lose you don't lose all that much," McGraw said. 
In their last meeting against Pittsburgh at the Joyce Center, McGraw was very displeased with her teams play. After starting the game on a 15-3 run, Notre Dame found themselves tied at 19 midway through the first half. The Irish allowed Panther center Mandy Wittenmyer to score 23 points while guard Laine Selwyn added a double­double. 
Courtney LaVere led the Irish with 14 points. Notre Dame had five players score in double figures in that contest.
