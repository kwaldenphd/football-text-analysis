Dr. Musial considersfree CityDay 
by Professor Thomas Musial 
Among all the other things that Free City Day is, it is an opportunity to think about what kind of contribution we are all making to the Notre Dame academic community-not so much the selfish reflection we so often pause to make about "what we are getting out of our education," but rather the reverse consideration, "what we are giving to the education of others." 
This is an especially important thing to do for the more permanent residents of this community-the "teachers." A few friends and students have asked me to make my thoughts public. I thought I would be denying something of what a community of learning is all about to have refused. 
Just what ought a teacher of a general humanities course (the Collegiate Seminar) be doing for his students? It's a tough question for me because of what I think the humanities are all about. The humdnities are concerned with a quality of living, and ultimately, for me, that means not only knowing various alternatives for living a good life, but choosing one or responsibly constucting one for yourself and living it. 
What can a teacher do within the 

framework of a formal course (with schedules and assignments and credits and grades and all the rest) to help others live a better life? The usual first response to such an awesome task is to say, "That's not my business, or, ''The task is impossible." But such a response is a first-class professional (in the pejorative sense of the term) educator cop-<>ut. So the question must be answered not only theoretically, but in practice. I can share some of my theory. I will keep working on the practice. 
I still think that Socrates can be taken as my educational model, but I, of course, must make modifications and personal adjustments. Socrates questioned and analyzed issues that arose entirely out of his own experience. Few men find within themselves the vast resources that he did. But as a teacher, I can supplement my native resources-dud those of my students--with other men's thoughts and experiences which, once 
understood and shared, represent something to grow up to, something that 
will  enlarge  the  self  by  assimilating  a  
qualitative  model  of  thought  or  
experience.  I  find  these conciliatory  

experiences in the great books and great art works that a teacher can select as the basis of his course. 
But books and art works are only part of the educative models that a teacher can offer to his students. He must, himself, be one of his models. The teacher must represent an exemplary way of proceeding. He must be an example in the practices of his day to day concerns and course proceedings of how a student can responsibly arrive at his own answers to questions of fundamental human

~~\~ G-race here Friday I 
Trustee J. P. Grace, un.;.!er fire from segmc11ts of the university community for the alleged behavior of his co~pany in Latin America, has agreed to meet with students and faculty in an open meeting on Friday. The meeting, which will be held at S pm in the Library Auditorium, will be moderated by Fr. Dav~d Burrell. Fr. Burrell is trying to assemble a panel of faculty members, with expertise in the field of Lat~n Ameri~a economics, to question Mr. Grace about the deahngs of h1s 
company. . 
Mr. Grace's company, the W.R. Grace Compa~y, 1s cha~ged with the economic exploitation of various Latm Amencan countries in which it has extensive holdings. Critics charge that his company moves into vari~us count~i~s and strips them of their natural resources, w1thout glVlng them adequate compensation. 
Grace's name has been repeatedly mentioned by students 
who have allegedly documented the financial holdings of · · several trustees. These students claim that the Trustees:~~j represent the "upper class corporate elite" in the nation, and :m: :;~; as such give the "military-industrial complex" de facto control ;:;:;

significance and make those answers a vital part of his life. 
With Socrates as the ideal, I champion the charismatic teacher. I'll not take time here to enumerate ail of Socrates' characteristics as a teacher, for I merely want to stress that every teacher ought to strive to manifest in his own way his own compelling charisma. Such a charisma is a testimony of the vitality in his own life of what he teaches. The teacher must devise a way in his classroom pedagogy to share what he has found vital in his own life, and again he must offer himself as a living example of the meaning and value of what he teaches. In the language of J>lato'sPhaedrus, he must be the visible incarnation of his gods, the gods which provide him with the total pattern by which he educates and is educated 
himself. What he is must persuade or compel students' assent to the necessity and humanizing power of the teacher's personal daemon. 
I might suggest that the process of humanistic education, as I am here presenting it, can be understood in ter~s of helping another person grow by seemg in others constructive examples of living-of thinking, feeling, and acting. The student in this way may fill voids in himself which the teacher helps him discover. From this point of view, vicarious sharing of thought and affective experience between the students, teachers, and the authors and artists of a course syllabus becomes the basis of the person's individual growth and social

respecttorstudent 
by Bro. Patrick Carney Citing improvements in re­spect for faculty members over the years he has taught, Dr. Willis Nutting expressed a hope that students would soon ex­perience that same respect in his keynote address to the Free City Symposium last night. Nearly sixty people heard the professor trace the history of higher education in the United States from its earliest begin­nings with the purpose of training men for the ministry. These schools, according to Dr. Nutting, had groups similar to boards of trustees established bv the religious denominations to see that the teachers did not get out of line. When the secular authorities take over, there was a similar set 
up because now the purpose was to make good citizens. Teachers were hired to "teach right" and would be fired if they did not. 
Dr. Nutting sees a great change in recent times with regard to the respect accorded teachers. "We're now treated well," he said, "although I h~te to admit it since most of myhfe I have said the opposite." lie cited the American Association of University Professors (wwhich he referred as "a high class teachers' union) as having a lot to do with giving the teachers more say and pointed out that he felt that the organization's recent award to Fr. Hesburgh for his help in this regard was very well deserved. 
It was in the position of the

awareness. Obviously, in this light, everyone is both a teacher and a student. That, in my opinion, is the vital core of a true academic community. 
One of the principal functions of the teacher, then, is the extension of the knowledge and awareness of others. The professional teacher (one who earns his Jiving by virtue of his special contribution to the educative process) must bridge the thought and experience gaps between himself, his students, and the authors and artists that arc his educative models. He must understand a student's experiential frame of reference and converse with him where he is in terms he can understand. He must understand the experiential frame of reference of the author or artist that is studied in the course. He must know how he can intellectually and sentiently relate to each of these worlds of experience and how he can translate the language of one into the language of the other. Th e professional teacher must also provide a perspective that those he teaches do not have. His qualifications are largely three: he has greater knowledge, experience, and maturity; he has a more disciplined ability to evaluate thought and experience; and he stands in an objective relation to the thoughts of those he is helping to grow. From this vantage point, he is in a good position to 
nurture his students' instights, help  hem  
form  a  more  synoptic view, and  check  
their critical caprice.

WASIIINGTON (UPI) -The United States provided military advisers and other support yes­terday for South Vietnamese attack on Communist forces just inside Cambodia. provoking charges in Congress that Presi­dent Nixon might be widening American involvement in Indochina. 
The White House said Nixon would address the nation to­night, presumably to announce his decision on Cambodia's re­quest for extensive U.S. military arms and supplies. It said yester­day's action was not the Pre­sident's response to that request. 
The speculation in diplomatic circles was the Nixon, hoping to avoid any appearance of direct American involvement, would arrange for indirect supply of arms to Cambodia through Allied nations, such as Thailand.

Editorial: 

Free City Day 
Tomorrow, Free City Day, is intended both as a day of celebration and festivity and as a time to raise serious and imaginative questions about the quality of education that we receive at Notre Dame. At other campuses, educational reform has been an explosive issue; at Notre Dame the serious questioning and dialogue has remained on a limited scale. More than any other issue, educational reform should attract the attention of the students, faculty, administrators, alumni, and parents. 
Tomorrow's activities allow for the faculty that are sincerely concerned about students and the quality of education here to talk to students on an informal basis. The day's activities provide an opportunity for Father Walsh and the other administrators to learn from the students that are interested in discussing change. And Free City Day permits the students to demonstrate to the faculty, administrators, and trustees, that they are concerned on a large scale about innovative educational reform. 
This discussion and concern is to be set against an atmosphere of enjoyment and festivity. The questions that have many times been asked in anger or disappointment can be raised tomorrow in a more conducive mood. 
Tomorrow is an opportunity to "turn Notre Dame into a free city of the mind." Concern on the part of students or faculty or administrators is vital if Notre Dame is to become the great Christian university that it has the potential to become.

predicting the future course of world affairs. "If we do this, the result will be disaster, if we do that it will help the cause of freedom, etc." 
The funny thing is that no one ever really seriously looks back and checks out the prophecies of the past against present reality, except an occasional article writer who does this to provide an interesting sidelight on some famous personality. But certainly we ought to do what we can to learn lessons from the past, and a valuable lesson ought to be learned from recent events which have bearing on at least one major prediction made a while back: the domino theory. 
The idea that a communist victory in South Vietnam would lead to further communist success elsewhere in Southeast Asia was used as one of the main bulwarks in defense of U.S. policy in Vietnam. 
From the beginning of the anti-war movement this argument came under bitter attack from its chief prophets for a variety of reasons, the main one of which was that it supposedly misunderstood the very essence of the Vietnamese conflict, that is, the fact that it is a civil war. Because the Vietnamese communists were involved in a civil war, the argument ran, their only interest was the establishment of a just regime in Vietnam, not elsewhere. And if this was truly their only interest, then the domino theory was simply a false analogy. 
The confirmation or rejection of these opposing ideas has come earlier than might ordinarily be expected, even before the end of the war in Vietnam. For it is clear now that communism in Vietnam is indeed interested in furthering communist power beyond the boundaries of Vietnam, and that communist power in that country is endangering the regimes of other Southeast Asian countries. Laos has been divided between indigenous Pathet Lao communists and a "neutralist" government for years, but a major change has occurred in recent times for the bulk of communist strength in Laos is now provided by the North Vietnamese Army. Cambodia has hitherto experienced minor troubles, but now for the first time is facing serious internal strife, occasioned by the presence of many North Vitnamese troops within its borders. The communist threat was so pointed, in fact, that it led to the overthrow of longtime Cambodian leader Prince Sihanouk. 
This is not an argument for (that favorite liberal whipping boy) "monolithic communism." Obviously there are different varieties of communism and obviously national differences effect the way that 
communist regimes act in the world. I am merely noting an empirical fact: that Vietnamese communists whether or not they are nationalists before they are communists -are interested in furthering communist power beyond the boundaries of Vietnam. This fact is one of many that supports the idea that while there are definitely different communisms, there are qualities which tend to appear pretty consistently in all of them, for example, an ideological and expansionist nature manifested in concrete attempts to spread their power and ideology. 
What will be the argument of anti-warriors now that there is undeniable proof that Asian communists will attempt to translate power in Vietnam into power in other nations? Some will revert to isolationism undoubtedly -"so what if all of Southeast Asia falls to communists; they're not any worse than we western imperialists, and why should we care what happens thousands of miles away anyway?" Others will come up with discoveries of new social injustices and claim that this has produced new "civil wars" (which the North Vietnamese communists have decided to assist, out of the goodness of their disinterested little hearts). Many will use the same old arguments, ignoring the same old -and some new -facts. Most however will simply ignore all the practical realities of the situation, because they are too wrapped up in their moral diatribes to observe (or admit) the effects of their positions on the practical realities of world affairs. Having once proved their failure as prophets, they will avoid similar, repeated embarassments -by merely ignoring the future.

Strong he comes, too, and ominous, wearing and holding a nobility of soul that no one else, for all their surface finery and physical attractiveness, can either parallel or comprehend. 
The Phantom dwells in a Paris opera-house that stands above dungeons, torture houses and other remainders of 


medieval times. As the film opens, the old place is being sold to new owners. A word panel flashes--it's a silent film, incidentally, if you didn't know already 
"You will possibly hear that this place is haunted ... " and the new owners respond jovially. 
But the place is haunted, and no one is more haunted than the young under­study, Christine Daae'. A bitter Phantom wants her -wants her love; wants her devotion and offers to make her the world's greatest opera singer. (The pro­cess of offering and acceptance is left to 
Another Swiftie by Ed Ellis 

A Modest Proposal for 
As a result of certain recent events, climaxing a trend I see as having developed over the past year, I have decided to present for the perusal of the informed hierarchy of this University, (also the Board of Trustees, should they concern themselves with this matter), a modest proposal for the alleviation of the multitudinous difficulties occasioned by the inexplicable attempts of the University Board of Trustees to exert various forms of control over the students of the University. 
My proposal and its benefits I shall present shortly, but first I should like to describe the momentous series of events that has drawn me from my frisbee game and projected analysis of 3-dimensional tic-tac-toe to the forum of public affairs. These events center about the attempts by the Board of Trustees to effect control over the Student Body, contrary to their acknowledged raison d 'etre. The real reason for the existence of the Board probably exists only in the mind of Fr. llesburgh and his fellow absentee landlords, but observers close to the situation assure me that control of the University was not one of the reasons. The one generally acknowledged to be true is that the Board of Trustees was established in order to name certain buildings or. campus after members o{ the group. Evidence for this view abounds on the campus north of the Administration Building, e.g. Grace llall, LaFortune Student Center, and it's even rumored that when the current gold-leafing wears off the Administration Building itself, the undercoatof metal will be permitted to oxidize in the elements and the building will be renamed "Rustin Dome," after the Trustee of that name. Supporters of this view of the Trustees cite the fact that the most useless building on campus was named after the Sultan of the Trustees, Mr. Stepan. 
At any rate, if the Trustees were formed for the purpose of naming buildings, then we can immediately see that they've gone outside the realm of the imagination. So is the Phantom's 
rationale. Perhaps he loved her for all the 
vowels in her name. It certainly wasn't 
for her good looks. Or for her ability as a 
pantominist.) 
Letters of warning are given to the 
prima donna's mother and to the owners 
of the Theater, but they go unheeded. In, 
ironically, a performance of Faust lights 
flicker, grow dim -· and the huge center 
chandelier falls crashing to the floor. The 
management has no choice. They must go 
with Ch£istine. 
So the Phantom, responsibile for the 
tragedy, comes to collect his bride. And 
she, who has never seen his face, is ready 
to go. "Walk to the mirror," he instructs, 
and as she does the mirror swings open to 
admit her to a labyrinth-land, creaking 
and moaning. And then the Phantom 
touches her. 
He wears a mask, but the terror of his 
face shines through. He begs; implores ­she comes; down stairs in an underground city until they reach a black horse; the horse trundles slowly to an unlit Styx. Dirge like they travel; Pluto and Proserpine, until they reach the Phan­tom's home. And there, after being given gifts and tenderness to the full degree of the Phantom's capacity -"It was you · who brought the love out of me...it was 
you who brought the good out of me--" 
she removed his disguise. 
It would be pointless to categorize the 
Phantom's ugliness. He was truly horrible. 
He had no lips! and his bony face 
bespoke death. 
Promising to remain faithful to the Phantom, she pleads to be released. The Phantom agrees, demanding, however, that she not see her suitor, a suave, debonaire, not-too-bright Count or some­thing. Naturally, the first thing she does is 
contact the Count. And the Phantom 
writhing and snarling, watches them plot 
to escape to England. 
Recapture of the heroine, murder of an incidental, the chase, the battle; the whole pattern for horror movies of the · next three decades grim, fast-paced savage and bitterly and inexlorabJy;1just. 
But the grim justice is tempered''by the ·.,, mercy-the Phantom's mercy .. For the Phantom is the hero. He, and he alone, is a passionate man. He bargained for a woman's love, but he bargained justly and fairly and out of a real need. lie captured the woman he loved when she betrayed him, but he did it with dignity; and only because he knew that he needed her love to drag him out of the dungeon he was trapped in. Only he acted from depth of emotion. 
Only he had a soul. Perhaps the only reason he had a soul was because he was played by Lon Chaney. Chaney .s talents, even in a silent film, rise high above his colleagues­particularly his leading lady, Mary Philbin, whose repertoire of facial expres­sions ranged from disgust to disgust. Even when she smiled she looked disgusted. In addition, she was probably cross-eyed. 
Bad news. 
The other actors, Norman Kerry, Arthur Edwin Carewe, and a task force of ballerinas showed no particular brilliance and the cinemotology was poor indeed, at spots the film looked like a poor home movie--but Chaney transcended all that. He had an important statement to make about the nature horror and the nature of man, and he did. And hedid it proudly. 
Phantom of the Opera. Go and see it. But not just to laugh. 


Acceptance of and Humble Submission to the Decree of Sultan Stepan 
their power in their unilateral decrees on student life. What started out as an ego trip has degenerated into a vain attempt at long-distance, frustrated parents. The recent action of the Trustees, apparently designed to make the ampus safe against fornication and other assorted nasty practices of youthful types, has succeeded (if not in protectionism) in squelching the concept ot hall autonomy and in forcing regressive behavior on the part of the students. And of course we must contrast the maturity of pouting Trustees (who maturely rejected all recommendations of people closer to the school than Florida), with the childish honesty and forthrightness of the Hall Presidents and the Student Life Council, who presented detailed rationales for the obviously immature policy of hall autonomy. 
The actions which have made such a proposal as I will present necessary are the declarations of defiance to paternalism made by some 18 of the halla on campus. 

Now one might at first consider the most appropriate reaction to a treat such as the Board of Trustees now presents to be rejection and a demonstration of support for Student Body President Dave Krashna. But one also ought to consider the nature of the individuals one is dealing with. These are not immature, peevish, fools like our leaders. They are mature, independent men, whose idea of a concrete contribution to society is to have a building named after themselves or to bully kids around with a title.

what an engineer does oll 'che job -but there were so many tests. 
Tests, tests, tests, lab reports, tests, tests. (Maybe Dick Gregory is right when he says that tests are becoming the most Important tnmgs at college today.) 
Yes, for a lot of engineering students, not being able to pull that $900/month starting in June is a hard blow to take, especially after four years directed toward that goal. Granted, however, that most engineers are not the money-hun~y, pseudo-student-trainee, apathetic members of the university community that some would stereotype them to be. It's just that the engineering student really doesn't have the time to get involved. An engineer can get a true education, as soon as he realizes that there's more to college than text books and a sliderule. 
Jim won't get his deferment, and neither will Ray. Maybe their futures are ruined. But what about the kid who couldn't get into college, or even take high school algebra, or chemistry, or physics, who never even had the chance to think about such things as an occupational deferment, or a full time research assistantship'! Ya, what about the kid who went to work full-time in that steel mill or with the street department. 
Everyone pretty much agrees, that now the draft system is more equitable; that, afterall, engineers should not in fact be treated as priveleged characters. The question comes up though, as to why it took so long for government officials to wake up to the fact that a college engineering degree shouldn't be used as a criteria in determining who does this country's dirty work. 
Graduating engineers are now getting drafted just like everyone else. At least though, they've got four years of college under their belt. And who knows -the war in Nam may be over 3 years from now if one is presently a freshman. The war is still very much far away unless of course, Congress has the nerve to throw out all college student deferments...who do they think they are anyway?
