House leaders meet, discuss FBI probe 
WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 6,-1980 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Attorney 
General Benjamin Civiletti met 
with House leaders last night 
and indicated his department 
will oppose giving evidence in 
the FBI's political corruption 
probe to congressional investi­
gations. 
Civiletti proposed the meet­
ing with congressional leaders 
concerned about the FBI inves­
tigation, in which eight mem­
bers of Congress have been 
implicated. 
Following the session, the 
Attorney General said he had told the congressmen that the Justice Department will present to the House Ethics Committee Wednesday' 'the position of the department on preserving the integrity of the investigation and ... the role of the Ethics Committee." 
Asked three times if that 
meant he will refuse to turn 
over videotapes and other evi­
dence implicating congress­
men, Civiletti replied: ''I will 
make no further comment." 
But Justice Department offi­
cials said they traditionally 
have negotiated with commit­
tees to brief them on cases but 
have declined to turn over 
documents and other evidence 
until the criminal cases are 
closed. 
Civiletti said Philip Hey­
mann, assistant attorney gener­
al in charge of the department's 
criminal division, will present 
the J usticc Department's posi­
tion to the House Ethics Com­
mittee on Wednesday morning. 
The Statement might be given 
in public. 
On Monday, Ethics Commit­
tees of both the House and 
Senate met to discuss reports 
that members of Congress were 
implicated in the FBI investiga­
tion. The chairman of the 
Senate Ethics panel informally 
asked Civiletti for Justice De­
partm~nt . help with its own 
mvesngatton. 
The Senate panel met again Tuesday and its chairman, Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., said he hoped committee members would receive a briefing from Justice Department officials. 
Before Civiletti's meeting 
with House members, Heflin 
quoted thf..-j1ttorney General as 
saying it was possible that 
congressional and Justice De­
partment investigations could 
be conducted simultaneously. 
But late in the day, Heflin 
said he had no word on whether 
the Justice Department would 
cooperate with an investigation 
by the Senate Committee. 
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., a 
member of the committee, said 
he hoped the lone senator 
implicated so far in the investi­
gation, Harrison A. Williams, Jr., would agree to appear before the panel. 
"Either it can be explained or 
it can't," Helms said. "I would 
hope he would appear voluntar­
ily." . 
During Tuesday's meeting, 
Civiletti said he described to 
. he House leaders the process­es of the FBI investigation ''without identifying names or specific cases." 
The meeting with congres­sional leaders followed by sev­eral hours Civiletti's appear­ance before a Senate subcom­mittee where he ran into criti­cism because of the leak that led to publication of details of the FBI investigation. 
Sources have said FBI under cover men posed as aides to a wealthy Arab sheik willing to buy favors from congressmen and other public officials. 
In all, some 20 public officials and 10 businessmen and law­yers have been implicated, sources say. Undercover a­gents paid out almost $500,000 in cash, but sources said fewer than half the officials a::tually

Afghan rebels initiate new &>viet attacks 
(AP) Anti-communist rebels, showing better organizationa:nd equipped with heavy weapons, have launched new attacks against Soviet troops in north­east Afghanistan's remote Badakhshan province, inflicting casualties on the Soviet units there, Western diplomatic sources in India reported yes­terday. 
The Soviet news agency Tass confirmed an upsurge in attacks since last weekend in Badakh­shan and the other eastern provinces, Nangarhar and Paktia, but its report did not mention Soviet troops, saying instead that Afghan soldiers were "liquidating" the "bandit gangs." 
The Tass report also described the enemy as "well armed," indicating that the ragtag con­tingents of Moslem tribesmen of just a few weeks ago may _be giving way to abetter coordm­ated rebel force. 
In the Afghan capital of Kabul, some 100 shops burned down in a major fire early Sunday morning, Western dip­lomats in New Delhi reported. They said reports spread in Kabul that the fire may have been set to cover up a looting spree by Soviet soldiers. 
In other developments: 
Tass denied as "monstrous m'isinformation' ' reports by the Christian Science Monitor and Newsweek Magazine that So­viet-led Afghan troops last April massacred more than 1,000 men in an eastern Afghan village whose inhabitants were accused of helping the rebels. 
U.S. National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski ended rwo days of talks with Saudi officials in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and diplomatic sources there said the oil-rich kingdom is expected to help the United States fi­nance a major program of military and economic aid for Pakistan as a result of the Soviet intervention in neigh­
boring Afghanistan .

President Valery Giscard An anti-communist Afghan D'Estaing and West German militant, Khan Nassry, told a news conference in Geneva, Switzerland, he has proposed to Arab oil states that they raise oil prices by $1 a barrel to raise $2 billion in military aid for the rebels, fellow Moslems, in Af­ghanistan. Nassry identified himself as chairman of the Afghan Islamic National Revo­luuonary Council. 


Festival retains full budget 
by Bndget Berry 
Doug Krietzberg, Sophomore Literary Festival chairman, said yesterday that the $13,000.00 budget they expected in the begi~ning. of the year has remamed mtact. 
Cultural Arts Director Dave Ellison commented yesterday that a budget cut had never been defimte and that the release of this information was "nothing less than literary ir­
responsibility.'' The "information" Ellison referred to was contained in an 

· Observer article which appear­ed)an. 24. The article reported on the basis of an interview with Krietzberg, that the Festi­val "anticipated" a $2,000 cut, but the plans for the cut were not yet definite. 
t<:llison commented that he was somewhat angered and totally surprised by the neg­ative publicity given the Festi­val. He said that the overall cooperation of the Observer has been commendable and noted especially ''excellent cover­age" of the Blues Festival. 
''There really is no story,'' Ellison insisted repeatedly. He said that all setbacks have been "expected disappointments." Planning and executing the Festival is a strategic game, he explained.

Inaccuracies appear after riot 
SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -While more bodies were hunted in the still-smoulering ruins of the New Mexico State Penitentiary, a state official said yesterday many prisoners risked their lives to save hostages from the horrible atrocities inflicted on some inmates. 
Furthermore, Felix Rodriguez, deputy secre­tary ofcriminal justice, said many of the convicts trapped in the weekend rioting should not have been there in the first place. 
After revising the death count several times, officials said yesterday atleast 36 inmates died ­some ofoverdoses of drugs-in the 36-hour reign of terror, the most savage prison riot of modern times in this country. Thirty-nine had been reported dead at one time. 
Inmates said a convict execution squad armed with blowtorches and axes killed some prisoners in a cellblock that held men identified as informants . 
The murders, beheadings, torture and mutil­ations ended when state police and National Guardsmen moved in Sunday l>fternoon . 
Warden Jerry Griffin placed the death toll at 33 yesterday. But three other officials said 36 were confirmed dead. Gov. Bruce King's press secretary,Jill Marron, said Griffin's total did not include three bodies found in the burned-out gymnastum. 
Dr. James Weston, state medical examiner, said some of the 3 3 bodies examined by his staff had been mutilated, but he could not determine scientifically whether inmates had been· tortured. 
''Some had injuries suggesting torture, but nothin~ you could check with a microscope,'' he satd at a news conference in Albu­querque. Weston confirmed that one inmate had been decapitated and that another arrived with a rod through his head. He said he thought both incidents occurred after death. 
He said mutilations were confrrmed in a minor­ity of the cases, but said most of the dead

Mardi Gras revises plans 
Although everything is ac­

counted  for,  Day  said  the  
committee  stands  to  make  
$10,000  less  profit  than  last  
year.  

The proposal calls for co­operation of every hall in the ND-SMC community as well as the effort of each student. All ticket chairmen will meet at 
6:30 p.m. tonight in Stephan Center, at which time tickets will be distributed. The tickets will then be sold and distri­buted by hall section leaders. 
The goal is to sell two tickets to every student, according to Dax. 
There is an added incentive in this new campaign which should stimulate competition between halls and increase cooperation ofall students. The halls which sell the greatest percentage of tickets per person will stand to win cash prizes of $100, $50 and $25. All books sold in each hall will be labeled with the name of that hall giving them the chance to win the raffle prizes. 
Day said he anticipates that "response should be at least as good or better than the United Way campaign because all rev­enue is going directly to student associated, local charities." He said he hopes ·that every hall ''will g-et into the spirit of compeution.'' The Observer will print daily tables comparing the percent­age of tickets sold in each dorm. 
''Without the problems of the raffle, this might be a record year f?r Mardi ~ras'' said Day. Mard1 Gras IS under tight control this year," Day said, ''and construction is going famously well-incredibly better than in past years." said Day. He said costs have been cut and dealer school attendance ts ''better than ever.'' 
This campaign calls for a joint effort involving all stu­dents of the ND-SMC commun­ity. "The good thing about this campaign is that it will reach out to those students unable to purcha~e books before,'' said Bob Morin, chairman of Mardi 
Gras. · 
Tickets will be distributed tonight and the campaign will run until the night of the drawing. Off-campus students wishing to buy ticket~ may stop by Stephan Center or the Student Union/Student Gov­

A campaign similar to the United Way campaiga will be launched tonight with the hopes of bringing in revenue for the 1980 Mardi Gras raffle. Mike Day, business manager of Mar­di Gras needs ''full cooperation of all halls in order to recoup our losses"--losses due to prob­lems in raffle ticket distribution earlier in the school year.

Assailant confronts student 
A South Bend high school student attending an Upward Bound class on the Notre Dame campus last Saturday was con­fronted by a former boy friend and struck on the forehead, it was reported by Security. 
Her assailant is a South Bend high school student not invol­ved in the Upward Bound Program, and he ran off after brandishing a knife at the girl's escort. 
The victim was examined at the Student Health Center and referred to her private physi­cian. The incident occurred at 
11:45 a.m. outside O'Shaughnessy Hall. 
ninth member of Congress may be involved in the case. 
But his source, who asked not to be named, said that at this time the ninth member does not appear to be the subject of further scrutiny, unlike the seven House members and one senator whose names became public over the weekend. 
A source said Tuesday that ''the cases of those eight will be presented to grand juries." 
Civiletti, in his appearam:e before a House appropriations subcommittee Tu·esday, ran into criticism from senators upset about news accounts of the FBI investigation. 
"Reputations have been ir­reparably damaged,'' said Sen. Paul Laxalt, R-Nes. 
Sen Lowell Weicker, Jr., R­Conn., told Civiletti: "The basic question here is that without any presentation to a grand jury, without any indict­ments, this is all out here in full view. Does it not make a fair trial very difficult?" 
Civiletti said he shares the Senate's concern about leaks that led to revelation of the investigation and that is why he ordered an ''intensive investi­gation" to deter~ine the source of the news accounts. 
But in general, he confirmed press accounts of the FBI ,probe saying they are "quite expansive and quite explicit." 
He said he' had heard that reporters were asking questions about the inve~tigation, but said he was surprised by detail­ed press accounts he read over the weekend. 
''I did not know the degree or the extent of the leaks or the number of organizations that were in possession of the facts or some of the facts,'' he said.

Krietzberg attributes the can­cellation of three authors-E.L. Doctorow, Sam Shepard and Mario Vargas Llosa-to "some­thing inherant in the system." 
Because the budget has al­ways been limited, he said, agents are not employed and contracts with the artists have never been made. As engage­ments are not binding, Krietz­berg explained, cancellations are typical. Fortunately, he said. cancellations this year have come well in advance of the Festival. 
He added that substitutions should not be too difficult as the English department has been invaluable in providing infor­mation and ''making contacts.'' Krietzberg attributes his optimism about the success of the Festival to confidence in his staff. They hope to promote the

The men's doubles racquetball tourna­ment is single elimination. Each match consists of three games (best-of-three series). The pairings for the tournament will appear every week in The Observer. It is the responsibility of each participant to contact their opponent and set up the match for each round. (Phone numbers 
·~re lit!~d in parenthesis below). The 
re.i4Jits of the matches must be turned in, 
in person, to the interhall office before 
noon on the following Wednesday. 
Failure to report the results will mean 
disqualification of both participants. 
Results will be accepted only if the 
participants have filled out the proper 
insurance forms. Failure to fill out forms after the first week of the tournament will also mean disqualification. 
Due to the design of the single elimination tournament, some participants will receive byes. Those listed as having a bye should check next Thursday's paper for their opponent.

What is the future of athletics at Notre Dame? 
The first open forum concern­ing that subject since the athletic department's an­nouncement Jan. 16, which put a hold on all future athletic grant-in-aids except for football and basketball, was sponsored by the Grace Hall social com­~ission last night in the dorm's 
Stephens, associate athletic director, and Joseph O'Brien, assistant athletic director and business manager. Also in attendance were captains from the football and hockey teams, and representatives from a host of other men's and women's sports, both of varsity and club status. Approximately 100 people were in attendance by the conclusion of the one and a half hour discussion. 
"Where does all the money go?" said Stephens. "It goes to the general fund of the University. Fr. Joyce (Rev. Edmund P. Joyce, executive vice president) and the Board of Trustees are the ones who decide where it goes from the general fund. 
"Our university has per­formed beautifully for many, many years--on the basis of self-determination. We have decided this is the way to go. Now we are confronted with bureaucracy. They (the gov­ernment) are sayin~ thi~ is.~he way to run your umverstty. 
This would appear to be the crux of the controversy sur­rounding the future of Notre Dame athletics. The recent ruling from Title IX has put its university's administration into the position of not being able to control its own athletic budget. Changes must be made, and Stephens indicated a decision concerning those changes IS imminent. 
"Fr. Joyce will meet with the of Trustees in the next fort­
night," said Stephens. "The 
only thing I can tell you is that 
this whole matter is going to be 
wrapped up by them. Not 
everybody is going to be happy 
with the dectsion, but if you 
follow the track record of Notre 
Dame, it will be satisfactory to 
the majority of the people.'' 
"What people?" was the retort of many in attendance. "All of us," answered Stephens. 
Who would be effected by the forthcoming decision seemed to be the concern ofall the athletic interests represented at last night's discussion. 
One major issue was the future of women's athletics. 
"I am not going to say Notre Dame's philosophy of women's athletics will make you happy,'' said Stephens, "but the people who run this institution have decided that this (the present philosophy) is the way to go. 
" I think they (the forces behind Title IX) are expec~ing Notre Dame to come up with a women's basketball team at the same level as the men's team. We don't have a physical education school--we don't 
&rive to bring~ greu kmak 
athletes. 
''Do you want us to go out and recruit great women's teams? Is diis what Notre Dame wants? Are we going to become like a state school? We must propose to have our athletic programs function within the overall framework of Notre Dame." 
Greg Meredith, captain of the hockey ream, was the only speaker besides Stephens and O'Brien to make any speech last night. The hockey team received the most scholarships 
(20) of all the sports whose status' are in question. 
''I heard this indirectly,'' said Meredith, "but I heard from an official in student government that Fr. Joyce said one of the worst decisions he ever made in his tenure at Notre Dame was to create a hockey program. 

' the University in this whole matter has been abysmal. Someone is lying concerning the status of the hockeJ pro­gram. I just hope the Univers­tty sees fit to come out with a_ ftrm statement soon and let us (the students) kn'ow what is going on." Meredith received an enthus­iastic round of applause for his statements. Stephens also came. out wit? a statement expresstng optt­mism for a sport which has received little funds from the University thus far--soccer. ' 
. Kevin Lovejoy's sport is the sport of the future," said Stephens. "Soccer. It is the coming sport.'' Yet Lovejoy later brought out the fact that the soccer team had to cancel a trip to play Loyola-Baltimore next seas<?n because there was no money m the budget for it. The soccer team does not have any scholar­ships under the University's present allocations. ''The athletic department wil not make the final decision," said O'Brien. "Fr. Joyce and Kel~v Tripucka could see some time in tonight's game the Board of Trustees have the versus Manhattan. He has been out ofaction for two weeks. final say concerningthe matter'.'
