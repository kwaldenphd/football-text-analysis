WASHINGTON 
Fighting back tears, President Bush vowed Thursday that America would "lead the world to victory" over terrorism in a struggle he termed th~ first war of the 21st century. Secretary of State Colin Powell identified Osama bin Laden as the prime suspect in Tuesday's attacks in New York and Washington. 
"There is a quiet anger in America," Bush said, adding he would travel Friday to New York, site of the World Trade Center twin towers obliterated in fearsome attacks earlier in the week. 
Bush spoke as officials said 4,763 people were unaccount­ed for in New York, where ter­rorists on Tuesday flew hijacked jetliners full of fuel into first one tower and then the other. The death toll was likely to reach 190 at the Pentagon, which took a similar hit. 
The nation's anger rising as the death count climbed, Congress hastened to vote $20 billion as a first installment on recovery and anti-terrorism efforts. There also was discus­sion about passage of legisla­tion authorizing a military response to the attacks, although administration offi­cials made clear they believed the president already had the authority he needed. 


There was a jarring reminder of the events of Tuesday at the White House. At midafternoon, streams of people left the Old Executive Office Building next to the White House, saying they had been told to evacuate by the Secret Service. However, White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said there was no evacuation. Uniformed officers cleared people from Lafayette Park across from the White House in what Fleischer said was an expansion of the securi­ty perimeter around the presi­dential compound. 
Two days after the terrorists hit, officials said they believed there had been 18 hijackers in all on four planes -one crashed in a field in Pennsylvania -and were pur­suing thousands of leads in the investigation. 
A few hours after Bush spoke, Powell confirmed pub­licly what other officials had been saying privately. He said bin Laden, linked to the bomb­ing of the World Trade Center and attacks at America·n embassies in Africa in the l 990s, was the prime suspect in Tuesday's attacks. Bin Laden uses Afghanistan as his base of operations.

Studen~ hope for good news

News Writer 

Tuesday's tragedies left Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students with many questions about missing family members and friends. For some, the questions were answered with­in hours, while for others, defi­nite answers will most likely take a long time. 
For freshman swimmer Georgia Healey, the hours it took to hear from her family in Manhattan still seem surreal. 
"When it happened I was at swim practice. I got out of the pool, and the radio was on with eyewitness accounts. It was strange, I couldn't believe it," said Healey. "I got dressed and went up to the coach's office, where I saw the picture -buildings gone and huge smoke-and I realized what had happened. Immediately I tried calling home. but I couldn't get through. Then I started crying because I knew my parents had big meetings near the World Trade Center." 
Healey's teammates were supportive, and her captain took her to her house and made breakfast for her and fellow teammates. 
"After breakfast I managed to talk to my grandfather and he said my uncle had talked to my dad. He's an early riser because he's a bone cancer doctor. Later I found out that they turned his clinic into an emergency care center," said Healey. 
Healey received more posi­tive news regarding her family when she returned to her room at 12:30 p.m. to find an e-mail from her mother saying that everyone in her family was fine. 
"I was relieved, and went to the Grotto with my friends," said Healy of receiving the e­mail. "When I got back to my room I had a call from my sis­ter. At first she was fine, but then she started crying and I started crying. I feel so lucky that I have my parents, because so many children don't have their parents, and wives don't have husbands." 
After talking to her sister, Healey spoke to her mother, who reported that when she looked down the main avenues, they were filled with black smoke, and that Air Force jets were flying all around. Her mother also told Healey that all the police were out, even those in the police academy, and there were two­hour lines to donate blood. What Healey remembers most about her conversation with her mother is her mother's advice. "My mother said,

Officials plan library prayer vigil for Sunday 
By ERIN LARUFFA Associate News Editor 
In honor of the victims of Tuesday's terrorist attacks, sev­eral campus organizations are joining together to plan a memo­rial candlelight procession on Sunday. 
The procession is the work of multiple groups on campus. including different organizations within student government, as well as Student Activities and Campus Ministry, according to Jesse Flores and John Cannon, two students helping to plan the memorial service. Many of those groups called the student gov­ernment office, added Cannon.I ooking for a way to do something to help relief efforts in New York City. 
"We were looking for a way to bring together all the campus groups to provide some relief," said Cannon. 
Campus leaders also said that prayer is a powerful way to help victims and their families as well. 
"I think that this will be a good way for our community to come together in prayer," said student body vice president Brian Moscona. 
The procession will begin at 
7:45 p.m. at the Grotto. Father Mark Poorman will preside over the opening of the vigil, and the Folk Choir will also perform. 
Then, the procession will move to the reflecting pool in front of the library, where Father Richard Warner will preside. The Glee Club will also perform near the reflecting pool. 
In addition, there will be

The dust is being cleared from the wreckage of the World Trade Center towers. It is gradually set­tling and people are being found, dead and alive. I. like most of the country, am still trying to come to grips with what happened. I'd like to clear my mind of all the hurt, pain and that 
happened. 
But I can't. 
Everyone from President Bush to the people next door have been talking about how we are going to punish those who hurt us, going to get revenge for what happened. 
But revenge won't bring

the towers when they fell. It won't bring the family back that were on those planes that 

Lab Tech 
crashed. It won't even take away the hurt, fear, pain and anger we're experiencing because ofthis travesty. It might make us feel vindicated for a while -like we did some thing in the honor of those innocent that were killed. 
But then, what about the innocent that we would kill in gaining vengeance for our beloved? 
Does getting revenge stop the hatred from hap­pening? Does it make things right -is it justice? Does it make us any better than the terrorists if we blindly seek revenge on the people who are like those who attacked the towers and the Pentagon'? 
I think of Tuesday. I remember waking up and finding my dorm mates frantically trying to find if their friends and family are okay. I remember going to class and hugging my classmate ·as she watched the television screen. I remember letting people know classes were cancelled for a day of prayer, Mass would be at 3 p.m. on South Quad and they could watch the news from the rooms on the North Wing of DeBartolo. I talked to someone who hadn't heard from her father in New York as we watched the newscast. I remember the Mass, where more than 6,000 students, staff and South Bend locals came together to pray for those who were hurt or dead and offer solace to those who hadn't yet heard from their families. 
I think of Tuesday and I see people helping each other rebuild their lives. I see people searching for peace. 
We're looking for peace of mind and heart, a peace that would help us rest without nightmares, without terror. Could we rest with that peace know­ing we were causing others to suffer? 
I'm not happy with what happened in New York and D.C. on Tuesday. I'm appalled at the audacity and blindness of the people who organized and car­ried out the attack on our way of life. Yet, I'm searching within myself to forgive them. It is hard. I have friends in both places and don't yet know if they're all safe. But my panicking isn't going to find them. My raising Cain isn't going to bring them back from the dead. 
On the message board outside my room, I have a quote from Eleanor Roosevelt: "You must do the things you think you cannot do." 
l challenge you, Americans and residents of the United States, to find it somewhere in yourselves to forgive the unforgivable. Look past the horror and see a way to peace. Become strong from the love and friendship we share. Hating will not stop hatred, but love will. Be strong and be at peace. 
Deus dona nobis pacem -God grant us peace.

HARVARD UNIVERSITY 
School receives bin Laden money 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 
With federal authorities investigating Osama bin Laden, Harvard University has come under fire as a recipient of bin Laden family money. Sheik Bakr Mohammed bin Laden, Osama bin Laden's brother, made two gifts to the University to fund fellowships for advanced study in Islamic culture. One such fellow­ship, at the Harvard Law School, provides funds for "research on the history of legal institutions in Islamic states past and present, particularly insofar as they uphold or apply the Islamic shari'a." Another, at the Harvard Design School. provides money for "advanced studies in Islamic architecture ... and appropriate building technologies as they pertain to Islamic built environments." Wednesday, University officials quickly distanced themselves from Osama bin Laden, saying the gifts are "in no way connected" to the terrorist. "The bin Laden family is very large, with dozens of siblings and half siblings who bear the bin Laden name," read a statement released by the University. 
UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN 

Abroad students in the dark 
MADISON, Wis. 

There is no shortage of media coverage to keep American citizens informed about the recent attacks, but the news abroad is sometimes less extensive. Stefanie Carton, a sophomore studying in Madrid, Spain, said the local television channels show the same images and run the same stories repeatedly. "Being here I felt totally disconnected", she said. Carton said representatives of the U.S. Embassy visit­ed the campus Wednesday to give American students information on precautionary measures they should take. "Basically, watch your tracks," she said. Being abroad also exposes students to a number of differ­ing opinions from other international students. "It's a good lesson for America," said Clea Mailliard, a freshman from Paris also studying in Madrid. "The Europeans are happy because it proves the U.S. is weak."

Attacks force change 
in ROTC uniforms 
By ANDREW THAGARD 
News Writer 
Tuesday's terrorist attacks 

prompted Notre Dame Navy 
and Air Force ROTC comman­
ders to temporarily suspend 
students from wearing their 
uniforms. The Army ROTC's 
uniform policy, however. 
remained unchanged. 
According to Col. Mark Gehri, Notre Dame Air Force ROTC commander, the deci­sion to halt wearing military uniforms was made at the Montgomery, Alabama head­quarters Tuesday. 
"It was just a prudent mea­sure, even though there was no local terrorist threat," he said. 
Gehri emphasized that the decision was made as a pre­cautionary action to ensure the safety of the students and not in deference to terrorists. 
Similarly, Notre Dame Navy ROTC's decision on uniforms followed a precedent set by the Navy as a whole, though each individual unit could decide whether or not to observe it. 
"We pretty much followed suit with the rest of the mili­tary," said Capt. Jim Shelton, commanding officer of NROTC. "The actual decision was part of a reaction to the initial attack that occurred." 
Air Force staff resumed its regular uniform policy Thursday afternoon, and the Navy expects to follow suit soon. 
"I was very anxious to get 

mine back on," Gehri said. 
"(Friday] you can expect the 
Air Force ROTC back in uni­
form. Ifs time to represent 
ourselves to the citizens." 
"We're going to be getting back into uniforms very soon," Navy Capt. Shelton echoed. "If things go the way they're cur­rently going, they [midship­men] will show up in regular uniform." 
Shelton, however, down­played the effect the absence of uniforms has had on the unit. Navy ROTC students do not wear their uniform to every class and there is not a scheduled event that requires uniforms until next week. 
"Thursdays students are typ­ically in uniform but they obvi­ously didn't wear them [yester­day]," Shelton said. "It really wasn't a huge change." 
Similarly, Gehri said that the temporary uniform policy change attracted little atten­tion. 
"I think everyone is so absorbed in processing the shock and disbelief [of Tuesday's tragedy]," he said. "I wouldn't be surprised if there were multiple reactions by the campus community; however in times of national strife like this, support goes up."

Panelists address terrrorism 
By ERIN LARUFFA 
Associate News Editor 
Students and faculty crowded into a DeBartolo classroom Thursday to participate in a panel discussion entitled "After September 11: Rethinking Terrorism, War and Security." 
Organized by the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies and the Kellogg Institute for International Studies, the panel contemplated the meaning of Tuesday's ter­rorist attacks against the United States. 

"After a day of prayer Tuesday and reflection yes­terday, we 
gather as an "Our greatest weapon is 20 percent intellectual of the world

said. "But to address the diffi­cult part: how one deals with the sources of terrorism." 
In part, Americans must rec­ognize that most of' the world is not as well off as the U.S. A long-term response to Tuesday's violence would therefore involve dealing with the causes of enmity in the world. 
"Let us admit, if we can bring ourselves to do so, that we live a world of excessive inequali­ties," said Williams, citing the AIDS epidemic in Africa, the crisis in Indonesia and the hatred in the Middle East as examples. Furthermore, she added, the income of the poorest

Panelist Shirley Williams, a 

member of the British House of 
Lords. brought her European 
perspective to the discussion. 
"We in the Western world 

have to forge a common 
response," said Williams. She 
added that she and her fellow 
Europeans feel sympathy for 
Americans. 
Williams pointed out that unlike most of the world, the United States has been, until now, relatively free of terror­ism. 
"This is not the first time there has been a major act of terrorism," \Villiams said. "The remarkable fact is that for so long the United States has been invulnerable." 
"Since the end of' the Cold \Var," she added, "the United States has in some ways felt itself to be invincible, the great superpower that did not feel itself to be vulnerable." 
Although some people might desire revenge, \.Villiams said that retaliation is not a long­term solution to terrorism. Instead, Williams encouraged Americans to ask themselves, "What did we do wrong?"

People have

Panelist George Lopez, a gov­ernment professor and fellow in the Kroc and Kellogg Institutes, said that the U.S. should respond to the attacks with "unprecedented" policy deci­sions. However, he added, Americans must act according to the rule of law. 
"This is the time when the 
rules matter most," he said. In 
part. that means not completely 
destroying Afghanistan, the 
country thought to harbor sus­

"We could turn Afghanistan into a parking lot tomorrow. And then what happens after that?" he said. He pointed to the problems the international community had with Libya, the country that was protecting the individuals who were believed to be responsible for the bomb­ing of PanAm Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. However. because leaders involved in the crash investigation followed the rules of law, the suspects were eventually brought to trial.

"We will conduct attacks. We 
will kill lots of people," he said. 
Further, Lindley said, it is 
impossible to rid the world of 
terrorism. 
"We can just hope to slow it 
down." said Lindley. "Vicious 
surprises are the way of the 
world." 
He explained that while such 
attacks are not moral, they are 
nevertheless frequent. It is also 
common for civilians to die in 
such attacks, and wars are 
much more common than 
Americans typically think, 
according to Lindley. 
"War only seems rare to us 
because we fight our wars on 
other people's soils," Lindley 
said, adding that the "luxuri­
ous" position the U.S. has in the 
world is what makes Tuesday's 
violence such a shock to 
Americans. 
"There's a lot of hysteria right 
now," Lindley said. "There's no 
reason for the hysteria. In the 
end, we will all be fine." 
Although the final death toll 
will be large, it is a tiny part of 
the country's population, 
according to Lindley. He 
explained that he made that 
observation not to be callous, 
but instead to put the events in 
context to help Americans 
understand that the country 
will recover soon. 
"Our greatest weapon is our 
values and our way of life," 
Lindley said. 
The way U.S. consumers 
respond to the terrorist attacks 
will also have an impact on the 
world, according to panelist 
Layna Mosley, a professor in 
the government department 
and Kellogg Institute. 
Mosley said that the U.S. economy has been keeping the rest of the world out of a reces­sion over the last few months. The U.S. makes up a quarter of the world's economy, according to Mosley, and New York City accounts for 6 percent of the American economy. 
"A recession is likely. \Ve were already heading that way. This will probably make it worse," she said. 
Mosley also said she predicts the U.S. surplus will disappear. As a result, Americans will have to take a look at what the government is funding. and may also have to pay higher taxes. 
"U.S. citizens may have to make some tough choices," she said. 
The Kroc and Kellogg. insti­tutes plan to hold more University-wide discussions in the near future to address the consequences of the terrorist attacks.

4,763 01issing in trade center attack 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK 
The gruesome search through the graveyard of the Worfd Trade Center yielded no survivors as the death toll mounted Thursday, and hopes dimmed for more than 4,700 missing souls. President Bush promised to visit New York to "hug and cry" with its shaken citizens. 
Two days after the trade cen­ter was hit and destroyed by two hijacked passenger planes, swirling dust kept visibility lim­ited and sanitation trucks waged a losing fight against the residue of the blast. Hundreds of family members searched for any sign of their loved ones. 
Tens of thousands of resi­dents still could not return to 


their homes in a closed-off lower Manhattan. Nerves were frayed by bomb scares and false alarms, both in New York and in Washington. 
Even a small semblance of normalcy was yanked away: Airline flights at the New York area'.s three busy airports began for the first time since Tuesday but were abruptly halted. Police said a man was arrested at Kennedy airport after trying to slip past security with a false pilot's identifica­tion. 
The city also brought in 30,000 body bags for pieces of human remains. 
"Even scary movies do not happen like this," said Enver Kesti, 42, a pizza chef who returned to clean up a gourmet shop that once sat in the tow­ers' shadows. 
Bush declared Friday, the

day of his New York visit, a "national day of prayer and remembrance." He asked Americans to spend their lunch breaks taking part in services at their chosen places of wor­ship, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said. 
The president praised New Yorkers for showing "the com­passion of America and the bravery ofAmerica." 
New York was not alone in counting its missing and dead. The Pentagon said 126 people in the building were killed in Tuesday's plane attack. Seventy bodies had been recov­ered. 
Add the 4,763 missing reported by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, plus the 266 passen­gers and crew members who died aboard the planes that hit the trade center, the Pentagon and a field southeast of

Pittsburgh, and the total dead in Tuesday's carnage could be more than 5,000. 
That would be higher than the death toll from Pearl Harbor and the Titanic com­bined. A total of 2. 390 Americans died at Pearl Harbor nearly 60 years ago, and the sinking of the Titanic claimed 1,500 lives. 
Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz told reporters at the Pentagon that the U.S. response to the attacks that wrought these horrors would "unfold over time." 
"One thing that is clear is you don't do it with just a single military strike, no matter how dramatic," Wolfowitz said. 
In Congress, a bipartisan coalition worked on approving two measures: an emergency anti-terrorism package that could cost $20 billion, and sup­port for the use of force by Bush against those responsible. 
Up to 50 people were involved in the attack, the Justice Department said, with at least four hijackers trained at U.S. flight schools. Saudi 

fugitive  Osama  bin  Laden  
remained a top suspect.  
Attorney  General  John  

Ashcroft said authorities had "thousands and thousands" of leads. He said they had deter­mined that 18 hijackers were on the planes: groups of five on two planes and groups of four on the others. 
In New York, the difficulties of extracting bodies from the rubble meant that while 184 deaths had been confirmed, city officials prepared to watch the total soar. The missing 

. included nearly 400 city fire­
fighters and police officers. Another 2,300 people were injured. 
The lone bit of bright news was the recovery of two fire­fighters who slipped into an underground pocket beneath the rubble while searching for survivors on Thursday. The two radioed for help and were rescued by fellow firefighters several hours after they fell. 
At One Liberty Plaza, an office building near the trade center site, volunteers were evacuated when the top 10 sto­ries of the complex appeared unsteady. Workers fled, sprint­ing down the street. 
At a grief center set. up for families with missing relatives, Jeanine Nardone arrived to look for her brother. She had hung his photo in a Brooklyn subway station, hoping some­one would recognize Mario Nardone -a 32-year-old Staten Islander, 6-foot-1, 180 pounds, bald with blue eyes, who worked on the 83rd floor of Two World Trade Center. 
"He's a strong person," Nardone said. "He would not give up on us. And I'm not going to give up on him." 
Many family members stopped by the armory-turned­counseling center established by the city. Looking south from there, the seemingly endless plume of acrid, white smoke 
from  the  wreckage  still  
corkscrewed  above  the  
Manhattan skyline.  

At Bellevue Hospital, a blue wall erected around a con­struction site was covered with pictures and descriptions of the missing, and prayers for safe returns.

Arab Americans attacked, threatened 
Associated Press 
FREMONT, Calif. 
Tension and fear still plagued ethnic and reli­gious minorities Thursday, even as President Bush urged the public not to take vengeance against Arab­Americans or Muslims for the terrorist attacks. 
In a neighborhood that is home to about two dozen Afghan-American businesses, people felt the president needed to extend protection to all the groups that now feel targeted or under suspi­cion because of the dev­astation in New York and Washington. 
Afghan-Americans also "don't have anything to do with this situation," said Zabi Habashzada as he bought bread in an Afghan market in Fremont, a city about 35 miles southeast of San Francisco. "They don't have to be blamed for an action done by some ter­rorists." 

The prime suspect in the terror plot is Saudi­born terror mastermind Osama bin Laden, who was given asylum by Afghanistan's Taliban rulers.

Parasitic computing threatens Web ethics 
By EMILY HOWALD 
News Writer 
Four Notre Dame professors recently discovered a new Internet vulnerability that is commonly known as "parasitic computing." 
The researchers found a way to "trick" Web servers around the world into solving logic math problems without the server's permission. 
"We're using other people's computers to solve problems," said Jay Brockman, an associ­ate professor of computer sci­ence and engineering. "You come up with a question and they can respond if the logic question is a match." 
Along with Brockman, the team consisted of Albert-Laszlo Barabasi, Hoffman Professor of Physics; Vincent Freeh, assis­tant professor of computer sci­ence and engineering; and Hawoong Jeong, research assistant professor of physics. 
The research was primarily an academic exercise and used as a lecture topic for the pro­fessors; however, the findings were printed in an issue of Nature. 
The researchers found that they could tag a logic problem onto the check sum (the bit amount that is sent when a Web page is requested) and the Web server would process the request. When a Web page was requested without the cor­
rect check sum, the server 
would not respond to the 
request. 
Each of the math problems 
that were tagged on to the 
request by the researchers was 
broken down into smaller 
pieces that were evaluated by 
servers in North America, 
Europe and Asia. The results 
from each were used to build a 
solution. 
The major discovery. in this 
experiment is that other com­
puters are answering logical 
questions without knowledge 
of doing so. The work is per­
formed without consent, creat­
ing an ethical dilemma. 
The researchers agree that if 
"parasitic computing" becomes 
more widespread, then the 
procedure is not ethical. 
"We are using other peo­
ple's computers in this proce­
dure," said Brockman. "It can 
be seen as unethical because 
the whole process is borrowing 
a little bit of computation from 
another server." 
The technique does not vio­late the security of the unknowing server; it only uses areas that are open for public access. They find it useful ,because they found a way to use a computer elsewhere to 
solve a problem.

Shirt promotes unity, raises funds 
By ELIZABETH LEE 
News Writer 
For the 12th straight year, Notre Dame students, alumni, faculty, staff and football fans nationwide will don what has come to be known simply as "The Shirt." 
A proud display of school spirit at football games, The Shirt aims to unite Irish fans while also rais­ing funds for worthy causes. 
The tradition of The Shirt began in 1989, when graduate student Zheng de Wang was injured in a car crash on Notre Dame Avenue. Wang's parents made the journey from Tianjin, China to be with their son but soon found his medical expenses overwhelming. 
Sister Jean Lenz. sensing the family's hardship, made and sold T-shirts to students in order to raise money for his medical bills. Students took to the idea quickly and raised more than $100,000 for the Wang family. 
The idea of a shirt that both· helped students and unified the community was so popular that it became a tradition to sell a shirt every football season. 
Stemming from Lenz's initia­tive, half the proceeds from The Shirt's sales go into an account set up to assist students faced with unexpected costs associated with accidents or tragedies. The other half of the money goes to Student Activities to help fund student groups and clubs on campus. 
About 40,000 shirts are sold each year, raising an average of $250,000 per year. 
The design for each year's shirt comes from a contest open to all students. This year's design came from senior Michael de la Hosa, with the help of the Shirt committee president, junior Scott Palko. The University must also approve the final design. 

This year's shirt is navy blue and features an interlocking ND framed by the lyric "What Tho the Odds Be Great or Small." Inside the ND is an Irish ball car­rier striding toward an excerpt from George Gipp's famous plea to Knute Rockne: "When the team is up against it. When things are wrong and the breaks are beating the boys. Tell them to go in there with all they've got and win just one ... " 
This year. in addition to the usual extra larges, 1,000 medi­um shirts were offered. Next year. the committee plans to make more shirts in different sizes. 
"We found that the smaller size was definitely a demand the stu­dents had, and with the success of the [medium shirts] this year, I am certain that no longer will XL be the only available size," said Palko. 
Palko, a management and the­ology major from Ontario, Canada, is very excited about The Shirt this year and hopes to eventually have the entire stadi­um sporting The Shirt to make the stands one solid color. 
"After the Nebraska game last year, l realized that something needed to be done to restore the legend and lore to Notre Dame Stadium, and I am hoping that The Shirt 2001 will help to accomplish this goal," he said. 
This year's shirt sells for $15 and is available at the Hammes Notre Dame Bookstore, Irish Express, the information desk at LaFortune Student Center, the Varsity Shop in the Joyce Center and the Athletic Department at vvww.fansonly .com.

Families of Pentagon workers wait 
Associated Press 

ARLINGTON, Va. 
Sonya Rush, cradling a framed picture of her stepmother, says the hardest thing is not knowing whether to talk about her in past or present tense. 
Pentagon budget analyst Brenda Kegler, 49, has been missing since Tuesday, when a hijacked plane plowed into the military complex. Kegler, of Capitol Heights, Md., worked at the Pentagon for 30 years. 
"She's like the backbone of the family," said Rush. 
Rush was among more than 100 families who came to a Sheraton Hotel in Crystal City ­about two miles from the Pentagon -seeking information about their lost loved ones. The Department of Defense set up an outpost at the hotel to help fami­lies get answers. Volunteers tried to provide solace: holding a hand, gently rubbing a back or just listening. 
"They want to know_ where their loved one is, and unfortu­nately, at this time, we can't

"It's going to take a while," Owens said. "We don't expect it to happen any time soon. We want to be able to answer the question almost as badly as they want the answer." 
The Pentagon announced a preliminary death toll from Tuesday's attack of 190 people. Hours later, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said in an interview on ABC News that the final toll could go as high as 250. 
Floyd Rasmussen, a manage­ment analyst at the Pentagon, was at the Crystal City Sheraton. He had a picture of his missing wife, Rhonda Ridge Rasmussen,

pinned to his shirt. She began 
her job as a budget analyst in 
April. 

''I'll spend the rest of my life 
celebrating hers," said 
Rasmussen. The Woodbridge, 
Va., couple planned to move to 
California in October. They 
would have been married 27 
years on Nov. 23. 

Rasmussen said the airplane 
crashed into the building pretty 
much where his wife's office was 
located. Her body hadn't been 
recovered, he said. 

About 70 bodies had been 
removed from the buckled sec­
tion of the Pentagon as search­
and-rescue workers toiled with 
little hope of finding more sur­
vivors. 

Rescuers said they had received a signal from the flight recorder of the commercial jet­liner that crashed into the Pentagon, but they won't be able to retrieve the black box yntil they can get into the area of the building that collapsed. The black box may provide investiga­tors with information about the flight's last moments. 
Crews begin removing debris in that area by Thursday night, said Arlington County, Va., Fire Capt. Scott McKay. Rescue work­ers spent most of the day erect­ing wooden columns to stabilize the area to the left of where the plane crashed . 
The process of going through the rubble piece by piece and looking for remains is arduous, said Arlington, Va., Fire Chief Edward P. Plaugher. "We're going to be there many, many days," he said. 
The Army estimated it had lost 74 people: 21 soldiers, 47 civil­ians and six contractors. The Navy lost 42 people: 33 sailors and nine civilians. The Marine Corps and the Air Force believe they lost no personnel at the Pentagon. 





Airline landings halt in New York 
Associated Press 
The nation's skies remained 
practically empty on Thursday 
as only a smattering ofjetliners 
took off and several major air­
ports remained out of service 
for most of the day. The few 
nervous passengers who did 
travel faced strict new security 
measures following the terror­
ist attacks in New York and 
Washington. 
There was tension and con­
fusion as the aviation industry 
inched back into service for the 
first time in two days. 
The New York area's three 
major airports -Kennedy, 
LaGuardia and Newark, N.J. ­
were opened and then abruptly 
shut down as FBI officials 
detained several people for 
questioning in the attacks. 
Police said a man carrying a 
false pilot's identification was 
arrested at Kennedy after try­
ing to get past security. 
Earlier, Orlando International Airport and a ter­minal at LaGuardia were briefly evacuated over sepa­rate, unfounded bomb scares. And after briefly resuming lim­ited service, Northwest Airlines canceled all flights Thursday evening after receiving infor­mation a spokeswoman said indicated it was "not prudent to operate." No other details were released. 
Elsewhere, no planes had left Chicago's busy O'Hare International Airport by evening and authorities said Washington's Heagan National Airport, near many of the capi­tal's landmarks, would remain closed indefinitely. 
FAA Administrator Jane Garvey told reporters that Boston's Logan airport would not be reopened until new stricter safety measures are in place. The airport is under investigation for possible secu-

rity breaches before the 
attacks. 
Despite all the confusion, 
travelers for the first time since 
Tuesday had the option of fly­
ing in the United States -even 
if the service was limited to a 
handful of flights. 
At Sky Harbor International 
Airport in Phoenix, Sam 
Hemphill was among a dozen 
people lined up at a TWA ticket 
counter. He said· he was 
uneasy about flying but wanted 
to get home to Jacksonville, 
Fla. 
"Whatever happens, hap­
pens," Hemphill said. "You 
have to keep going. If you stop 
living life, they've won." 
Lisa Adamson of Vancouver, 
Wash., was among the passen­
gers on the first commercial 
flight to leave Portland, Ore., 
since Tuesday -a Delta jet 
headed for Kansas City, Mo. 
"I feel nervous," she said. People at the food court cheered as the jet took off. 
The airlines were grounded Tuesday after jets hijacked in Boston, Newark and Washington's Dulles airport were crashed into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field. 
Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta cleared the way for commercial flights to resume Thursday, saying air­ports would be opened and flights resumed on a case-by­case basis -but only after the new security measures are in place. Private flights are still banned. 
Under the tightest airport security since the Persian Gulf War in 1991, there will be no more curbside check-ins or vis­its .to terminal gates to meet passengers. 
Knives and other cutting tools, even plastic ones, are prohibited. Mail and cargo are temporarily banned from pas­senger flights.

'Georgia, there are people we know who are going to be dead. Be prepared for that. We just have to pray for them and help them the most we can."' Since talking to her mother, Healey has learned that a friend's father is still missing. 
Other students were also affected. 
On hearing the news Tuesday morning, freshman Greg Bosl, from Long Island began to worry about his brother, who works on the trading floor at the Stock Exchange, about 10 blocks from the WTC. He soon learned that his brother was fine, but later learned a friend had died in the WTC. 
"A guy I've known for six years died. He was in the first building that got hit. and was within eight of the floors where the hit occurred. On the news they said those people were counted as dead, instead of missing. He was my high school basketball coach's best friend. He came to all our games, and I'd coach his kids at camps," recalled Bosl. 
Junior Mike Donahue from Rockaway Beach in Queens, like Healey, recalls Tuesday as surreal. 
"My mom called me at 8:50 
a.m. and told me to turn on the 
T.V. I didn't understand the full severity of what was happening when I went off to class. When I returned after my 9:30 and saw the buildings fall I tried calling my house, but there was no answer. I called my aunt's cell phone and she was there and knew my mom was 
OK." 
Donahue was still worried about his sister, who works in Midtown Manhattan, two miles away from the WfC. 
"She was working in Midtown, and she saw the sec-people working at the WTC. A close family friend is still miss­ing in action," said Donahue. "I called my sister in the city, and she picked up. She said, Tm OK', but then she started cry ing, saying it was like a night­mare, surreal." 
Donahue lives next door to a fireman in Rockaway who has been involved in the rescue efforts. 
"He told me that Rockaway is one of the hardesthit areas. About 100 people are still mis.5­ing, which is a lot for a small town,'' Donahue states. 
Senior Molly Moran, from Brooklyn woke up to the news of the tragedies. 
"I was just worried and my father was at work in the city. I didn't know exactly where the rest of my family was, and what they were going to hit next. I called my mom at [her work]. and she was comforting parents all day who didn't know where their spouses were. I also have had a lot of problems getting through." 
Freshman Kate Musica, who is from Washington D.C., was worried about her family there. 
"Both my sisters go to school across the river from the Pentagon, but I called and found out that Georgetown, where one of my sisters goes, was shut down. When I talked to my mother, she said that Tuesday and Wednesday night, soldiers were patrolling the city. I was very scared because I couldn't get in touch and couldn't talk to my family." 
For those still without answers, Healey offered advice. "Keep praying for families. Even after they rebuild the buildings, this is never going away."

Responding nobly in a time of crisis 
Last Saturday while Notre Dame alumni and fans watched the opening kickoff of the Nebraska game, I was completing a day of softball on Andrews Air Force Base. During the early tournament games, I watched Air Force One practice taking off and landing. Later several fighter jets practiced their take offs and flying maneuvers. Finally an older Air Force One jet took off for California where it was to become a permanent exhibit at the Reagan Presidential Library. 
None of us dared to imagine that two days later, on the following Tuesday. these planes would be involved in preserving the integrity of our government. 
Shortly after Tuesday morning's ter­rorist attacks in New York and across the river at the Pentagon, an eerie silence hung over the nation's capital. Many walked without speaking at all, while some spoke on their cellular phones as they passed by on the side­walk. Most who did conduct a conver­sation only spoke in subdued tones. 
It was nothing like the atmosphere of the Persian Gulf War a decade ago. It reminded me more of the long somber walk across campus from the Notre Dame stadium after a visiting team had upset the Irish. 
Washington workers evacuated the city at mid-day. It was a surreal scene in front of my residence on 15th Street. The one-way street ironically looked like a New York City avenue with cars quickly zipping by and the sidewalks uncharacteristically crowd­ed with solemn, numb pedestrians quietly walking away from the White House. 
Occasionally, police cars leading mini motorcades screamed as they 


carried cabinet and congressional 
members to secure locations in 
bunkers throughout the city. 
Overhead the sky was quiet except for 
the quick bursts of jet fighters 
patrolling above. 
As a Clinton White House pass hold­er still residing six blocks from the White House, I remembered when a small plane crash-landed on the south lawn several years ago. With the Secret Service's capability to down an approaching aircraft, I knew that it was more likely for a jet to crash on me than on the White House. After I heard of the hijacked jet that had crashed near Pittsburgh, I knew that the White House was a target on that sunny Tuesday morning. 
Undoubtedly the callous actions by those terrorists shocked our nation like nothing before in our history. Those heinous acts are the 21st cen­tury's slap of reality to our current college students' generation, more shocking than the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. It is the equivalent of Pearl Harbor's call to my parents' generation or the sense­less killings in Vietnam that forced my generation to prematurely set aside our youth. Tuesday's assaults just may or may not have created our next great generation. 
The greatness of our nation is unparalleled throughout the world. While Americans are resolved to iden­tify those responsible for this atrocity and bring them to justice, we walk a thin line between revenge and justice. 
Almost immediately after Tuesday's incidents, hundreds of hate e-mail messages and acts of vandalism were perpetrated against Muslim organiza­tions in the United States by Americans seeking revenge. Many callers on both radio and television talk shows have advocated war against all Arabs. It is reminiscent of the World War II internment of inno­cent Japanese Americans following the Pearl Harbor attack. 
Blind patriotism can cause some to act in a manner that is just as low and 
cowardly as those acts perpetrated by 
terrorists. Americans have set the 
world standard for freedom and 
democracy by openly living our val­
ues. Now is not the time to abandon 
our example by reacting like wild 
west cowboys. Diversity is the thread 
that binds our democracy. 
Ironically, initial indications point to extremist Muslim fundamentalists whose prior terrorist activities have been based on love of their religion. They believe that the United States defiled their holy land during the Persian Gulf War of the early 1990s. As a result, they have identified us as the "Great Satan." 
How do we combat such fervor? Many will propose that our govern­ment be permitted to monitor and intercept internet communications in the name of national security and intelligence. Some will advocate lifting the ban on assassinations abroad by our country's agents and military. Others will propose a form of domes­tic profiling based on heritage and personal appearance. These are some of the new challenges that will face our society as we attempt to sort out our response to Tuesday's terrorist assaults. 
The coming months will test our ability to balance our freedoms with our ability to fight terrorists with their own terrorist tactics. Our declaration of war on terrorists will give this country the temporary excuse to abandon certain civil liberties. The issue will be whether or not we act like a great satan in the name of free­dom.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 


What action should America take? 
Economic measures are viable alternative to perpetuating the cycle ofwarfare 
First off, we would like to express our deepest sympathy and prayers for all those killed, injured, emotionally harmed and struggling with the inhu­manity that occurred earlier this week. 
Retaliation is the word on every American mind over the past days. Sanctions, declarations of war and most prominently military action are just a few of the options the American people have been bom­barded with since the tragedies in Washington D.C. and New York. This call to action is more than expected when thousands of American civilians are brutally murdered. In the minds of the majority, nothing would be more satisfying than an all out military action; completely wiping out whichever terrorist or government committed these atrocities. 
It is imperative for the future security of America to hunt down those responsible and punish them. We must not passively turn and give the other cheek to terrorism. However military retaliation is not a viable option. Instead, an all out military action would continue and increase this vicious cycle of terrorism. Economic action can go a lot further in winning this type of war than military action. 
Instead of an all out military assault on whoever is responsible, the United States and its comrades should negotiate with countries like Afghanistan. We should offer those countries grain, money, edu­cational materials and other supplies that they need in return for the terrorists in their countries. In other words, off er them such overwhelming eco­nomic benefits that they can not pass up the oppor­tunity to improve their countries. America must make it known that is willing to offer enormous amount of economic benefits in the new global busi­ness of bringing terrorists to justice. 
If the United States decides to send aircraft carri­ers to the Indian Ocean and launch a series of air attacks, we might take out terrorists like Bin Laden. However, inevitably we will also manage to wipe out towns· full of innocent people, an act of terror­ism. Then all the husbands, sons, brothers, etc. of the innocent people killed will vow revenge on America and a seed of terrorism will be sowed. In attempting to wipe out terrorism the United States is only feeding a fire; the more you try to eradicate them, the more you will end up fighting. 
Retaliating and killing innocent people is exactly what terrorist like bin Laden want the Article Five nations to do. It will make martyrs out of the inno­cent people killed. In the eyes of the martyrs' family and friends, the United States will even more resemble the "head of a snake" that many believe it already is. Retaliation, bombing and wiping people out will only cause numerous more terrorist acts and more followers in their ludicrous ideologies. 
Economic and political negotiating is a course of action that should be considered. The Article Five nations need to open up a dialog with so-labeled "terrorist nations." Article Five nations, led by the United States, should offer them significant materi­als and money to help out their economies and increase their standard of living. In return for these handouts, as in the Marshall Plan, those designated countries will cooperate with the United States. By agreeing to cooperate, they will hand over the mas­terminds behind these heinous actions and agree to work in eradicating terrorism from our communal planet. If we can negotiate with these countries by offering them money and other economic goods, the Article Five nations will become allies with such countries as Afghanistan in the war against terror­ism. 
America can accomplish more utilizing this "eco­nomic warfare" than using our enormous military power to fight terrorism. The United States contains cities such as New York, Los Angeles and Chicago that each have a higher gross domestic product than Russia. Clearly we can offer numerous eco­nomic opportunities to third world countries. This course of action might be expensive, timely and dif­ficult, but it is more than worth suffering through another September 11, 2001.

Solutions other than traditional warfare must be sought 
Our best weapons against terrorism are not guns, planes and bombs. It is instead our devotion to the pursuit of liberty and the creative means with which we pursue it. 
Some reactionaries might call for war, but a War on Terrorism is likely to end up just as much a failure as our War on Drugs and our War on Poverty. War against an ideol­ogy is not felled by soldiers but by civilians with open minds and open hearts. An important part of winning a traditional war is demonizing one's enemies to stir up passions. That's exactly the opposite strategy required to win this new war that our President has declared. 
If we would focus some of our energy inward to reflect upon why certain people are so angry with the United States, we might understand that to be better accepted by foreign nations sometimes it's better not to throw our weight around like the world's bully. There's no way to befriend everybody all the time. but it's possible that if we paid more attention to the consequences of our actions we could avert all but the most militant of our enemies. 
And perhaps we should try leveraging the goodwill we share with our allies in order to freeze Osama bin Laden's assets, or even turn over his bank accounts to the people who lost their loved ones in the tragic attacks. This is just one example of a creative way to strike back against a known ter­rorist that would limit unnecessary bloodshed. 
Simply flying into Afghanistan, guns ablazing, will not shut down a terrorist network like Al Qaeda. That's because any Muslims we kill would likely become martyrs. Defusing the time bomb of terrorism will require honest dialog amongst our friends -and enemies. It will mean recognizing govern· ments that we don't like, such as Afghanistan's Taliban. It will also mean changing course on silly plans that the entire world is against, such as the militarization of space through a Missile Defense Plan. If we actively participate in making the world a better place for everyone, instead of making our decisions in an "I don't care what you think" kind of vacuum, we'd win more respect from friend and foe alike.

A new line has been drawn in the sand since Tuesday's tragedy and it is not between the 
U.S. and foreign terrorists. It is between the people who believe in action and those who believe in dialogue. 
I believe that our country's military needs to take action. My opinion has been called a knee-jerk reaction and an ignorant response to what has happened. Tell that to the dead Secret Service officers murdered in the World Trade Center. Tell that to the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines who have lost so many lives to terrorist attacks (Have we forgotten Beirut, or the U.S.S. Cole?). Tell that to the children out there without mothers and fathers. 
Our current government will have to make difficult decisions in the coming weeks. They will get their hands dirty, and there is a good chance of added bloodshed. Do I want more civilians killed? No I do not. But let's face it, the courts have not been a deterrent. Talking has not been a deterrent. The old saying "actions speak louder than words" rings true in how I feel America should respond. 
So continue to talk, as I hope you all will do. Speak loudly in support of our government or protest the actions they take in the future. I welcome and cherish all responses to this let­ter. Why? Because I live in the United States of America, where you can call the President an idiot or my father a baby killer because he served in Vietnam. That is a right you have. And God Bless that.

The tears of Our Lady wash away pain 
In this silence is screamed the horror, In this silence the terror reigns. The flight of evil has pierced sharply, And now such sorrow consumes the day. 
But one sound defeats this silence, One sound so bright in this darkened blaze. From the Sacred Heart are we bound tighter, As the tears of Our Lady wash away the pain. 
A family gathers to sing of faith united, A family cherished with her blessed name. The bells of this mourning are waking the silence, The toll of her tears hums a trickling peace. 
We wade together in this water of promise, And we walk beyond the hopeless strain. Tomorrow will come with the dark silence conquered, While the melody of her tears will pardon through strength. 
For there is but: One struggle, one family, one nation, one race ­One echo of one people, One God of All Grace. . .

Students, faculty offer views on attack 
Attack the root of the problem 
While our hearts continue to go out to all of those 
who mourn the loss of loved ones, it is important 
that we at this University begin to ask ourselves 
what lessons we might learn from the terrorist 
attacks that took place on Sept. 11 in New York and 
Washington, how we might minimize the likelihood 
of something so devastating from happening again 
and how we might best build peace in our world. 
The lessons we learn and how we respond as a 
nation to these destructive acts is of greatest impor­
tance and will affect the likelihood such attacks will 
be attempted again. 
Although it is important to find and prosecute 
those responsible for participating in the murder of 
so many. it is also very important to realize that the 
tough talk of reprisal that may play well to 
Americans, who are understandably angry, does 
nothing to prevent further attacks and in fact there 
is reason to believe that threats and tough talk sim­
ply make such attacks more likely rather than less 
likely. Remember, we are often dealing with people 
who apparently do not value their own lives, let 
alone the lives of others. To issue threats and to 
engage in tough talk is in effect to lay down the 
gauntlet. 
While it is important to do all we can to bolster our 
security and intelligence capabilities in order to 
expose terrorist plots before they can be carried out, 
it is of even greater importance to begin to do what 
we can to make such plots less likely from material­
izing in the first place. In other words, we must 
address the causes of terrorism rather than just the 
symptoms. 
While there will always be some "sick" people with a cause who have little regard for life, including their own, and there is no completely fail-safe way to pre­vent such people from attacking others, we should ask ourselves how we might make it less likely for such sick people to gain disciples, sponsors and pro­tectors. 
There are no easy answers but for anyone who has spent any time in developing countries, it is easy to see how poverty and, thanks to greater access to media in the developing world. a growing awareness of relative deprivation among people in poor coun­tries, breeds hate and is making it increasingly easy for "sick" people to recruit disciples willing to mur­der millions of people and end their own lives in the process. 
After World War II, the United States recognized that unless the winners of that war did something to, among other things, promote economic development in the countries defeated in that war, hate would increase, people would seek revenge and violence would resume. The Marshall Plan served to decrease animosity, to squelch the desire for revenge and to promote peace in Europe, a region where war had raged off and on for several hundred years. 
While the United States and Western Europe have grown increasingly prosperous during the last decades of the 20th century, many of the least devel­oped countries in the world have become increasing­ly impoverished. Any "war" on terrorism must also be a "war" on poverty. We cannot expect peace to prevail in a world where the gap between the rich and poor countries continues to grow as it has recently. 
Although anger is a natural response to the terri­ble events of Sept. 11, at a University like our own. especially at a Catholic University like our own, we must do our best to resist letting the anger ke.ep us from asking ourselves what lessons we might learn and how we might respond in a way that promotes true peace. While there is only so much we can do, let us dedicate ourselves to working for a more secure world by identifying and addressing the con­ditions that make terrorism more likely. 
While complete security is an illusion, it is possible that the world gradually become more secure if we attack the root causes rather than just the symptoms of terrorism. May God help us to do so. 
Father Robert Dowd The Helen Kellogg Institute for lncernational Studies Sept. 13, 2001 
God has not abandoned us 
I may not be a terrorist expert or a former govern­mental position holder, but I do know something about human nature and about humanity as it relates to tragedy and death. 
Firsthand experience has unwillingly shown us our natural feelings following _3--·­an eve~t of this level of atrocity: ,1,;/~ confusion, sorrow and pure , ~~ ~nadulterated an~er. And who >­

This brings us then to how a civilized man must look at himself and deter­mine which feeling he is to uphold and rely on to carry him through the days to come. All my heart and my most human of emotions tell me anger is not that feeling. 

I've lived this tragedy just as you have and have felt the same emotions that have come and gone in ,, your mind. Cries of l I

revenge and retaliation -i ; I seem to be the common response on campus to the \ "7\, ;'

tragic events, but how does killing justify more killing? ~j Are we to play God and take 

Many friends of mine from near and far have brought up the insanity of the situation and how those who celebrate it call it "God's will." Is this to say that God has created this evil? Isn't God the 
Almighty in Himself considered to be the root of all good? Why then has this hap­
pened? The simplest of all responses lies in the definition of evil. It is not 
something in itself but rather the lack or something. the i,~ lack of good. God has not abandoned us. He has not turned 
away. We have failed as a nation to be the corner­stone of freedom. We 
have failed as a people to be human. 
Unleash not the mili­tary, but the good Samaritan. Build not a missile defense, but a cure for hunger, a cure 
for disease, a cure for 

poverty. Show them not how America reigns superior, but how we as h~mans are human and ::: share the same future, ·\ }-~ share the same dreams.

Everywhere they are asking were you watching, were you watching when the airplanes met the giant, struck the giant in the groin? 
But the planes were full of people and the towers were full of people and the streets were filled with people when they toppled to the ground. 
Were you watching, were you watching when the airplanes struck the giant when the airplanes felled the giant, bloodied the giant in his nose? 
But the buildings were full of people and the planes were full of people and the towers were full of people and there were people on the ground. 
Everywhere they are asking are you watching, are you watching? Is the giant's vision clouded? Have his stinging eyes begun to clear? 
For the wronged and wronging giant is still a giant, still a giant, And everywhere are people waiting, terrified of his reply.

Student union encourages solidarity, prayer 
On this day of national mourning, we would like to offer our thoughts and prayers to all those touched by Tuesday's tragedy. Words cannot express our deep sor­row. 
It is especially important in times such as these that we unite as one in prayer as we did so powerfully at the campus Mass. Let us remember that spirit of compassion and hope in the coming days as we strive to embrace the Christian call to forgiveness. 
In memory of the victims of this tragedy and in solidar­ity with their loved ones, the University will come togeth­er for a candlelight vigil on Sunday evening. All are invited to meet at the Grotto at 7 :45 p.m. for a proces­sion to the Library Reflecting Pool. 
Donations will be accepted to benefit the families of New York City firefighters and police officers who lost their lives in the relief effort. 
May God bless our community, our country and our world.

With one MIAA game under their belts, the Belles will have to face the Knights of Calvin College on Saturday. The Knights, who finished third in the MIAA last season, losing only four league games, have won the one MlAA game they have played thus far.

ing," British Open champion David Duval said. "Will I be pre­pared to fly? I honestly don't know. I don't have the answers, I don't think any of us do right now." 
Event organizers and officials from both teams spent much of Thursday discussing the securi­ty surrounding the event and issued statements saying it might be several days before a final decision is made. 
Most of the Europeans, many of whom are stranded in the United States, want the match to go ahead, but U.S. stars have expressed reservations. 
Jim Awtrey, chief executive officer of the PGA of America, said their security was the high­est priority. 
"We continue to have discus­sions with U.S. captain Curtis Strange and have communicat­ed to a number of players that the safety of the team and their families is of utmost impor­tance," Awtrey said in a state­ment. 
"It is our desire for the Ryder Cup matches to go forward. Having said that, the magnitude of the matches requires many logistics which are impacted by the events of this week. 
"We are reassessing every logistic connected with the matches -a process which will take a number of days and which will require input from our government. When our assessment is complete we will make further announcements as appropriate." 
The European Ryder Cup Board also issued a statement saying it would increase security for the match to allay the fears of the Americans. 
Mark Calcavecchia, who ini­tially said he didn't want to trav­el, hasn't yet made up his mind. 
"If you would have asked me yesterday, I'd probably say that it wouldn't be played," he said. "Ask me again next Monday or Tuesday and you might get a different answer. 
"It's a timing thing. Time heals all wounds, and maybe next week it won't seem so bad. Maybe it will. If they play, I'll be there. If they don't, I'll support that, as well." 
Colin Montgomerie, expected to be one of Europe's key play­ers, wants it to go ahead. 
"If the Ryder Cup is canceled or postponed, you are allowing these terrorists to win," the Scot said. "We have to respect what­ever the Americans decide. They are our closest allies and we should bear in mind that this was not just an attack on America, it was and attack on the free world."

Winston Cup, truck races cancelled 
Associated Press 

LOUDON, N.H. 
NASCAR called off Sunday's Winston Cup race in New Hampshire because of the terror­ist attacks, only the second non­weather postponement in the cir­cuit's 53-year history. 
The decision on the New Hampshire 300 followed a move by the NFL to scrap games Sunday and Monday night. The race was rescheduled for Nov. 23, the day after Thanksgiving. 
"This is a time for families to come together," NASCAH presi­dent Mike Helton said Thursday. "We felt that postponing this weekend's race was simply the right thing to do." 
NASCAR also called off its truck race at Texas Motor Speedway on Saturday, rescheduling it for Oct. 
5. The Indy Racing League, whose season-ending race was scheduled for the Texas track on Sunday, postponed the event until Oct. 6. 
Two other weekend races at the New Hampshire International Speedway, in the Featherlite Modified Series and Busch North Series, also were postponed. It was unclear whether they would be rescheduled. 
"We hated to cancel, but at the same time you have to think of the people, all the problems they have in New York," said Bob Bahre, whose family owns the New Hampshire track.

The Big Ten, Big 12 and Southeastern conferences reversed field Thursday and postponed all football games this weekend because of the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. 
A day after announcing its teams would play, the three leagues joined the Atlantic Coast, Big East and Pac-10 conferences in calling off the games, meaning there will be no major-college football on Saturday. The NFL also post­poned its Sunday games. 
The schools from the six major conferences plus Notre Dame form the Bowl Championship Series, which picks its top two teams at the end of the season to play in its national championship game. 
This weekend, 116 games involving Division I-A and I-AA teams were scheduled. None of them will be played. 
"The Southeastern Conference joins all of the other major sporting entities in the nation in postponing all athletic events," the SEC said in a statement. 
"The conference continues to believe this country must begin the healing process following the horrendous events of the past week and will evaluate all future schedules at an appro­priate time." 
Other conferences canceling their games are, the \Vestern Athletic, Conference USA, Mid­American, Mountain West and Sun Belt.have not yet officially postponed its games. 
Notre Dame, an indepen­dent, called off its game at Purdue, a Big Ten school. 
Among the games postponed were three marquee matchups in Florida No. 13 Washington at No. 1 Miami, No. 8 Tennessee at No. 2 Florida and No. 10 Georgia Tech at No. 6 Florida State. 
Saturday's schedule had fea­tured 18 games involving 22 of the AP's Top 25 teams. 
Earlier Thursday, three games involving Top 25 teams were postponed -Utah State at No. 11 Fresno State, Bowling Green at No. 18 South Carolina and No. 25 Louisville at Illinois. 
It was an indication that schools disagreed with earlier conference decisions to play those games. Player reaction and travel concerns played a big part in the postponements. 
"There was real anxiety as the week went on on the part of our football team about traveling by air," Bowling Green athletic director Paul Krebs said. 
Before the Big Ten's change, seven of its teams had its games postponed -Illinois, Indiana, Northwestern. Ohio State, Penn State, Purdue and \Visconsin. Northwestern 's game against Navy won't be made up .. 
Some games have been rescheduled and conferences will be working_ to try to reschedule other games. 
On Wednesday, SEC commis­sioner Roy Kramer decided to go forward with the games. 
"We just feel very strongly that this was the appropriate decision to make," Kramer said. 
ACC commissioner John Swofford said, 'Tm sure every­body's preference would be for life to be normal and therefore play the games that were scheduled. But life isn't nor­mal. These are extremely extenuating circumstances, and consequently those cir­cumstances have been very impactful." 
The NCAA executive commit­tee, which will donate $5 mil­lion to disaster relief funds, had recommended that schools hold a moment of silence or some form of public recogni­tion at this weekend's events. 
"The White House has con­veyed to the NCAA that it is encouraging a return to nor­malcy across the country," NCAA committee chairman Robert Lawless said.

Commissioner Bud Selig said all players will wear American flags on their uni­forms for the remainder of the season, and the Stars and Stripes will be given to fans at all games Monday. 
Baseball will make up all the games by extending the regular season, which had been scheduled to end Sept. 
30. The games will be rescheduled for the week of Oct. 1. 
"I believe in the sanctity of the 162-game schedule,"' Selig said. 
That leads to the possibility of the World Series, long known as the October Classic, producing its first Mr. November. It originally had been scheduled to end Oct. 
28. 
"I believe that extra week will not be harmful," said Selig, who made his decision after examining which teams were in contention for the playoffs. "I worry about weather in October. Fortunately, we have a lot of warm-weather teams, a lot of West Coast teams." 
Selig made his announce­ment more than four hours after the NFL said it would not play this weekend.

Within 30 minutes of Selig's announcement, the New York Yankees planned to travel to Tampa, Fla., spend three days at their spring training camp, then play the Devil Rays on Monday in St. Petersburg. 

Two teams already had started traveling to the cities where they were to have played Friday. The Pittsburgh Pirates left their ballpark in buses at 11:15 a.m. EDT Thursday to travel to Chicago, where they were to play the Cubs. 
The Philadelphia Phillies worked out at Turner Field in Atlanta, then left at 1:30 p.m. in four buses headed for Cincinnati, where they were to play the Reds. After hearing the news, the Phillies decided to continue on, spend the night in the Cincinnati area, then head to Philadelphia.

 McGwire rips into baseball for decision-making delay 
Associated Press 
ST. LOUIS 
Mark McGwire criticized major league baseball Thursday for taking so long to postpone games the rest ofthe weekend. 
McGwire launched into an impromptu state of the game speech minutes before the deci­sion to take the rest of the week off was made public, and after the St. Louis Cardinals worked out at an empty Busch Stadium. 
"It doesn't take a rocket scien­tist to figure out sporting events are absolutely meaningless com­
pared with what's going on in Washington and New York," McGwire said. "And why are people taking so long to make a decision, I have no idea." 
In the wake of the terrorist attacks that lev­
eled the World Trade Center and damaged the Pentagon, President Bush said Americans should resume their lives. Baseball. McGwire said, shouldn't even be on the list. 
"For people to think it's OK to play sports this weekend is absolutely asinine," McGwire said. "This is the worst thing that can ever happen to the country and people are worried about making decisions on playing sporting events. 
"I have no idea where their minds are, but I guarantee you if they knew somebody or had a family member in Washington or New York, they wouldn't even think about it." 
McGwire said the call commis-

"I feel ashamed we're even talking about it," McGwire said. "For athletes to presidents of universities, general managers, owners of teams, to even think about taking a field, they should be ashamed. It's absolutely asi· nine." 
McGwire also ripped educators for keeping school in session the day of the attacks. 
"I was really upset when I called home to see if my son went to school that day, that his private school was in session," McG¼ire said. "What are people thinking about?

home for the weekend on Thursday after deciding not to play this week­end, but manager Tony La Russa  said day-to-day contact is impor­tant in baseball because timing is everything. 
The Cardinals are taking the day off Friday, the national day of mourning, but have a workout scheduled for Saturday morning. 
"The way you keep your timing is keep repeating as much as you can," La Russa said. "The boys have put a lot into these work­outs, for whatever it's worth." 
It hasn't been easy, for the manager or the players. 
"It's hard to concentrate on anything," pitcher Dustin Hermanson said. "I know you can't be sad all the time, but it's hard to crack a smile, especially when you think about all of this. It just eliminates all kinds of hap­piness." 
La Russa. speaking before the decision was announced, agreed with McGwire about baseball being of no importance right now. 
"Sports is entertainment, and when it's appropriate to be entertained, I'm all for getting our games going," La Russa said. "But until that time, I think we're better off holding back.

. In wake of terrorist attacks, sports quickly become insignificant 
Rarely does Robert Mueller, director of the FBI, the man in charge of investigating all the country's federal crimes including Tuesday's terrorist attacks, get on national television. 
Same goes for Scott McKay ofArlington County, Virginia Fire and Rescue, the man charged with the res­cue effort at the Pentagon.· 
These guys, like all the men and women suddenly thrust onto the world stage in the aftermath of the ter­rorist attacks in New York and Washington, do their jobs catching crimi­nals and rescuing children each day and return home to their families. 
No microphones. no reporters buzzing around their every word like bees. 
Barry Bonds rarely goes a day without being on national TV. He hits home runs, runs down an occasional fly ball, saves no children's lives, catches no terrorists and returns to the clubhouse to a glut of national media asking him about that 3~2 fastball in the third inning. 
People love Barry Bonds. They think he's a hero because he hits baseballs over fences in ballparks. That's what makes a hero, right? That's why everyone pays attention to him, and splashes his face across every newspaper in America, right? 
Barry Bonds is not a hero. 
Who are the heroes? 
The heroes are the men and women of 
America, the nameless and faceless people that pull away the guts of the World Trade Center, looking for both the living and the dead. The heroes are the federal agents, staying up all night, following every lead, every tip, every hunch, trying to find out who did this. The heroes are the New York City firemen and police officers that ran up the crumbling twin towers, rescuing terri­fied civilians, only to have the buildings come down on them, burying their hopes and dreams, but saving the hopes and dreams of others. 

The sports world seems so trivial right now. Your favorite team's record doesn't seem to matter when you're frantically dialing family and friends in Manhattan, looking for any sign that they're OK. 
Every other week, we focus on sports and athletes. Who's injured? Who's win­ning? Who's the favorite in the third race? 
Now we focus on the true heroes, and the things that should be most important to us. Is my brother still alive under all that rubble? How can I ever thank the Lord that I was late to work that day? Will my family ever feel the same? 
If there is any, however small, silver lin­ing to this most horrible of tragedies, it was that America has stopped and appre­ciated what's most important to them. Families have stopped, and given each other that extra hug that wouldn't have happened last week. The TV that normally doesn't budge off ESPN is stuck on CNN. 
Sports are games. And only games. 
Sports do not decide life and death, or catch terrorists who have killed 10,000 innocent people. Sports are not at the core of what makes us human beings, living, breathing, people. 
The core of us is our caring, caring for our families and friends but also that com­plete stranger, stuck underneath tons of dusty concrete. The core of us is our feel­ings that we are part of something bigger, an idea, a way of life. The core of us is that feeling, when you love other people so much, the thought that they could be sud denly taken from you makes you numb and humble before God. 
I think we all remembered that this week, and I hope we won't soon forget it.

. Saint Mary's-Hope soccer game still keeps respectful tone 
Tuesday morning I woke up to the news that two of America's most influen­tial cities had been attacked by terrorists. By 10 o'clock Tuesday morning both World Trade Center towers had crum­bled under their own weight. By Tuesday afternoon I knew that four hijacked planes full of American citizens had been the cause of the destruction. Wednesday morn­ing rescue workers were trying to sal­vage what lives they could from the wreckage. Wednesday after­noon Saint Mary's decided that its soccer team would play a game on Thursday. 
That seems like quite a decision to make in the wake of a national tragedy. You could ask how anyone could play sports in the wake of such destruction. The Big East has cancelled all of its events for the weekend and even Major League Baseball stopped playing. The question of how anyone could move on like that looms large in the minds of many. 
There is an answer. Because you have to. There were a lot of questions floating 
around on Wednesday night after the news that Saint Mary's would play came to light. And the only response is to say that life must go on. It is true that tragedy has struck the nation and any game at all seems trivial in its wake. But what hap­pens if the whole nation stops forever? 
The answer -the terrorists win. Thursday's soccer game began with the national anthem, a reflection and several 



minutes of silence to remember those 
who have suffered and still suffer under the weight of this disaster. And then the game began and the women on both teams sent a message to the spectators, to the nation and to the world. 
This tragedy, immense as it is, cannot kill the American spirit. Life in this coun try will go on. Although they may have destroyed part of our landscape, no ter­rorists will ever destroy our history, our past-times or our will to go on, to live. 
The women who played today and those who went to watch them offered a prayer to those who died telling them they did not suffer so that a country could be crushed forever. This country will not only remember them in its sadness and in its moments of silence, but this country will remember them in its passion to play and its passion to win. We will not go qui· etly about the business of falling under the weight of our fears. We will go on with our lives and live well in the freedom so many have worked so hard to secure. 
Canceling Division I events and profes­sional events is a matter of security and a matter of respect. The media circus that often surrounds Notre Dame football games and playoff races in baseball could take away from the solemn feelings still covering the country. 
But Division III soccer doesn't take away from the solemn sense of the coun­try. It doesn't attract the media and it truly offers, in its own way, a promise to goon. 
The terrorists responsible for the explo­sions on Tuesday were looking to scare the American people. And we are scared, but we won't let that fear destroy us. 
This country will go on, and this coun­try is already going on. Destruction may have caused us to pause but it will never cause us to stop. We will live and we will live in the way we always have, with pas­sion, in freedom, and with eternal grate­fulness for all that we have.

Belles ·resume soccer action, lose 2-1 
By KATIE McVOY Associate Spom Editor 
The Belles 2-1 loss Thursday showed just how young the Saint Mary's soccer team is. 
The players came ready to play, but for most it was their first home collegiate athletic event and it came under circum­stances that could ground any team. . 
Playing for the first time since Tuesday's devastation and play­ing in the cold, South Bend rain the team had a lot to deal with in its home opener against the Flying Dutch of Hope College. 
Following a moment of reflec­tion and prayer for those atTect­ed by the terrorist attacks, it was a difficult game to play. 
Despite the loss, both team members and coaching staff were happy with the overall per­formance of the team, although 
disappointed in the game's out­come. 
"I think it went well. We played well," said freshman midfielder Katie Taylor. "It's too bad we didn't win." 
'Tm very happy," said Saint Mary's head coach Bobby Johnston. 'Tm more upset and sad for [the team] because we have been working hard and it would be nice to sneak a win in instead of losing these two games."
