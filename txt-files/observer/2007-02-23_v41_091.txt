SMC announces new vice president 
By KATIE KOHLER Assistant News Editor 
The nearly yearlong admin­istrative search at Saint Mary's came to an end Tuesday as the College named Patricia Fleming to the position of vice president for academic affairs and dean of faculty. She begins her duties on July 1. 
Prior to her appointment at Saint Mary's, Fleming taught philosophy at Creighton University in Omaha, Neb. since 197 7. There, she focused on environmental and medical ethics and the philosophies of science and 

social science. In 2001, Creighton appointed Fleming to senior associate dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. 
Fleming also recent­ly served on a National· Academy of Science committee and cur­rently main­


tains a Fleming White House approved appointment on the Veterans Board on Dose Reconstruction. 
"In addition to being a gift­ed administrator, Dr. Fleming is nationally and internation­ally known for her research on the ethical implications of nuclear waste disposal," College President Carol Ann Mooney said in a statement Tuesday. 
"Her extensive involvement in Catholic higher education, her scholarly standing, and her administrative skills make her a perfect fit for leading the faculty at Saint Mary's, and I am excited about working with her." 
Fleming said she looks for­ward to working at a women's college and hopes her previous experiences have prepared her for this task. 

"There is an abundance of research that proves the value of a single-gender edu­cation for women, especially in the greater access it gives women to develop their tal­ents," she said in a state­ment. "I have met many impressive students and alumnae who demonstrate Saint Mary's extraordinary success in that arena." 
While the opportunity is new for Fleming, she said she is ready to take on the chal­lenge. 
"It is clear to me, when standing outside Saint Mary's, that it is the number

GLBTQ retreat builds on community, faith 
By AARON STEINER News Writer 

While public debate often places the views of Catholicism and those of the gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and ques­tioning (GLBTQ) community in opposition, organizers of the 10th annual GLBTQ Retreat say that is not an issue in this week­end's event, which begins tonight. 
Notre Dame's Core Council and Campus Ministry hope their joint effort will provide community and an opportunity for spiritual development -in a Catholic faith context -for members of the GLBTQ community and their friends. 
The theme, "Never Alone," was chosen by student ·leaders and addresses several different 
issues, said Campus Ministry intern Madelein-e Heck, who helped organize the retreat. "Never Alone" stems from the idea of the Christian "footprints" prayer, which describes Christ's presence in difficult times. The prayer has special meaning for those who struggle often, Heck said. 
"We hope it speaks to the feel­ing of loneliness sometimes felt )within the GLBTQ community)," she said. "This year the retreat is geared for the GLBTQ communi­
t} and their friends." . 
Both students who are mem­bers of the GLBTQ community· and their friends are welcome, Heck said. Having friends pres­ent will help to show that there are people "to walk with these students on their journey at

NDto change degree tradition 
By KAITLYNN RIELY Assistant News Editor 
The University will hold a separate commencement cere­mony for Master's and Ph.D. graduates from the Graduate School in May, breaking from its tradition of one ceremony for undergraduates and gradu­ates. 
University Registrar Harold Pace said Thursday the cre­ation of a separate ceremony for graduate students -a decision made last semester ­should shorten the undergrad­uate commencement on Sunday by approximately 30 minutes. 
In past years, Pace said, the ceremony has run about two ho.urs and 15 or 20 minutes. The ceremony this year should last under two hours, he said. 
The change, while not widely publicized outside the Graduate School community, took place last fall. In a letter to the Graduate School com­munity in November, University President Father John Jenkins said he made the decision to hold a separate ceremony along with Provost Tom Burish and Dean of the Graduate School Donald Pope­Davis.

Wzre Editor

hosting 250 mem­bers per class, our lunch rotations were divided into three separate blocks to fiJI the bellies ofravenous young men as quickly as possible. freshman would eat last, around noon, preceded by sopho­mores, who ate around 11:15. 
For the juniors, however, we were the first diners at 10:30 a.m. Seniors could select any ofthe three lunch periods, as part oftheir "privileges." We, however, were shunned by eating in a lunch win­dow during which we could have sneaked across the street and still caught the Chick-fil-a breakfast service. 
At first, the juniors were delighted to be the first to dine in our cafeteria. We could use the microwaves before they were marred by the obtuse freshmen who still hadn't understood why foil doesn't belong in that particular appliance. We could hoard the best Gatorade flavors from the vending machines or stock up on unlimit­ed breadsticks first. We had a leg up on those silly underclassmen. 
But we were clearly misled. By the third day ofschool, we noticed that our growl­ing stomachs seemed to form a chorus during our last classes, since it had been at least five hours since our previous n1eal. For those last few minutes ofthe day, we spent more time focused on the clocks than the blackboards because of our starvation. 
It was particularly bad for me as a par­ticipant in athletics. As a former rower, I eouldn't possibly grab some munchies during those 30 minutes in between the last bell and arriving at practice. Not only did I lack the time, but also I feared that my snack could potentially reappear on the rowing machines, in the weight room, or out on the water in a mid-workout. 
So, I had to come up with a counter­attack, and then the idea hit me: in-cla<>s meals. Of course, the Jesuits were by no means lenient if students were caught red handed with a PB&J. It wa<> distracting­and tempting-the teachers and stu­dent<>. So I had to be a<> surreptitious as possible, but a<> long a<> I pulled it off, I maintained sanity.

Man does 40 squat thrusts on elephant 
CHIANG MAl, Thailand­New Yorker Ac;hrita Furman looked around for a record he could break, and settled on doing the most squat thrusts in one minute. Then he decided on a place -the back of an elephant in north­ern Thailand. 
He achieved both goals Thursday ac; he climbed onto a platform on the back of an obliging pachyderm in blaz­ing heat and powered through 40 of the vigorous kicks in a minute. The previ­ous squat thrust record ­achieved on level ground in Britain without an elephant in sight-was 30.

Edith Stein Project to address ways to heal 
By LAURA WILCZEK 
News Writer 

Its goal last year was to "redefine feminism," but when the Edith Stein Project begins today, organizers hope to help women dealing with violence or societal oppression heal both body and soul. 
Today and Saturday Notre Dame will host a two-day con­ference entitled "The Edith Stein Project: Toward Integral Healing for Women and Culture." 
The conference started last year when a group of under­graduate women planned "The Edith Stein Project: Redefining Feminism." This year, both male and female students organized the event with help from Notre Dame faculty and members of the South Bend community. 
The focus on healing as an underlying and unifying theme in the conference is a shift from last year's focus, which tried to address the vocation of women in the modern world. 
The goal of this year's con­ference, according to the Center for Continuing Education Web site, is to "encourage and empower both men and women to understand the types of healing that need to occur, and to be healers in their families, communities and throughout society." 
The conference plans to uti­lize Notre Dame's strong sense of Catholic tradition and will focus on a holistic approach to healing as guided by the Catholic faith. The attention to healing on a physical and spir­itual level corresponds to its namesake, Edith Stein, a woman who valued her faith. 

This year's topics -which include sexual assault, pornography, women's sexual health and eating disorders ­will be discussed in conjunc­tion with how women can cope with and heal from such plights in contemporary cul­ture. 
The conference will feature multiple speakers, including Brandi Lee, editor-and-chief and co-founder of True Girl magazine; Dr. Jennifer Roeback Morse, author of "Smart Sex"; Paolo Carozza, associate professor of law at Notre Dame Law School; and Dr. Pia de Solenni, awarded the Pontifical Prize of the Academies by Pope John Paul II. 
The conference will close Saturday with a 5 p.m. Mass in the Basilica of the Sacred Heart and a banquet. While there is a registration fee for visiting guests, the c·onference is free for Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and Holy Cross stu­dents and faculty members.

Gebert's top goal for next year will be to get more members of the Class of 2010 involved in campus activities.

"It's so easy for everyone to get involved," Kielty said. "It's actu­ally my favorite thing about Saint Mary's."

Iran to expand uranium program 
VIENNA -Iran has expanded its uranium enrichment program instead of complying with a U.N. Security Council ultimatum to freeze it, the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency said Thursday in a finding that clears the way for harsher sanctions against Tehran. 
"Iran has not suspended its enrichment-relat­ed activities," the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a report. 
Although its information was based on mate­rial available to it as of Feb. 17, a senior U.N. offieial familiar with Iran's nuclear tile, speak­ing on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the issue, suggested the IAEA's conclusion remained valid as of Thursday. 
New Italian government discussed 
ROME -The Italian president began talks with political leaders Thursday to discuss form­ing a new government after the resignation of Premier Romano Prodi's nine-month-old administration. 
Prodi stepped dovvn Wednesday evening after an embarr~ssing parliamentary defeat of his government's proposed foreign policy program, including its plan to keep Italian troops in Afghanistan. He is staying on in a caretaker role. 
The consultations at the presidential palace are aimed at determining which political lead­ers, if any, might be able to muster enough sup­port for a parliamentary majority and thus avoid a new election. 
President Giorgio Napolitano might ask Prodi or another leader from his coalition to form a new center-left government. He also could ask an institutional figure above the political fray to form a government, possibly with broad support from both coalitions, or he could call elections.

The new passport requirements will take effect as soon as January 2008. In a change from earlier plans, children aged 15 or younger with parental consent will be allowed to cross the borders at land and sea entry points with certified copies of their birth certificates rather than passports. 
Children aged 16 through 18 traveling with school, religious, cultural or athletic groups and under adult supervision will also be allowed to travel with only their birth certificates.

Fleming attended Holy Names University in Oakland, Calif., and earned her bachelor's degree in philosophy and sociology from Marygrove College in Detroit, Mich. She earned her master's and doc­torate in philosophy from Washington University in St. Louis, Mo. Fleming will replace interim Vice President and Dean of Faculty Jill Vihtelic, who Mooney and the recruitment search committee selected last spring to serve in the position for one year. The position originally opened because previous dean, Patrick White, accepted the head role at Wabash College last year. 

Last spring, the College also named professors Joseph Incandela and Deborah McCarthy as associate deans of faculty and academic strategies, respectively. Jncandela and McCarthy will each serve for three years. 
The final appointee last spring was Karen Johnson, who now holds the position of vice president of student affairs. Johnson replaced Linda Timm, who accepted a head role at Mount Mary College in Milwaukee.

will look at "the image they have of themselves, the community's image of them, and how their faith helps them." 
Aiding students' faith develop­ment, "wherever they are on their spiritual journey," is always a goal of Campus Ministry retreats, Carey said. 
"In many ways, it's quite simi­lar to all the other retreats," he said. 
The retreat will feature three different presentations, including talks by a student member of the GLBTQ community and a friend, Carey said. Students will also be encouraged to use time for dis­cussion, reflection and Mass. 
As of Thursday, 16 students had signed up for the event, Heck said. Any interested stu­dents should call Campus Ministry for more information.

Councils

Callie Pogge and Alvin Adjei. 
Last year's Class Council races all featured at least two tickets, and Judicial Council president Liz Kozlow said it was "not expected" to see a ticket run unopposed. 
"It is surprising especially because it happened for two class­es this year," she said. 
And while four tickets may seem like a lot in comparison, Kozlow said it's "common" to see more tickets running for sophomore class positions. Five ran last year. 
"Students are excited to get involved and feel ready to lead their class," she said. 
The four tickets competing for Sophomore Class Council are David Landry, Nick Abercrombie, Laura Bodien and Dan Dixon; Adam Mathews, Jenna Adsit, Kathleen McDonald and Mike Hose; Grant Schmidt, Jeff Lakusta,

Notre Dame -both in regard to thr,ir sexuality and their faith," she said. 
In addition, Heck said, the retreat will attempt to show stu­dents that not only do they have friends on their journey, but they are also "always joined by Christ." 
For Father Joe Carey, assistant director of Campus Ministry, the theme of this year's retreat is about providing support. 
"The theme is based on the need for community, and support within the community through faith," he said. "Having friends attend makes a connection to the whole community, and makes 
realize that there's 

Joy Hwang and Kim Kyrouac; and Frank Vento, Cristina Romano, Sean Callinan and Gavin Green. 
A fifth ticket was also running, but dropped out of the race on Wednesday after two members decided they no longer wanted to run. 
The four tickets include mem­bers with a variety of different backgrounds and activities-ath­letics like men's varsity lacrosse and women's water polo to aca­demic clubs like Anthropology Club to religious organizations like Freshman Peer Leaders and Gospel Choir. 
All of the tickets hope they will be able to get input from their class as to what event<> should be planned and what the council should accomplish next year. 
"We'd like to bring things to the class and allow them to have input," presidential candidate Mathews said. 
Fellow presidential hopeful Schmidt said it was "so beneficial" to interact with his classmates and 

Con~.e and Read 
find out what they want from stu­dent government. 
"Even though there are so many people, you'd be surprised by how many people are in agreement," he said. 
While all of the platforms differ in certain plans, one theme is shared: improving class unity through a class formal, class trips and more apparel. 
Despite the long list of ideas on his ticket's Web site, Schmidt admitted it wasn't unique. "Our platform is extremely generic and we did it for a reason. There's so many ways you can go with things," he said. "We're not look­ing to change the world, but there's lots of fun things you can do and a lot of impact you can make." 
Although some of the ticket<> arc already involved in student gov­ernment, others see problems with the current Freshman Class 
Council and want to rectifY things. "The major problem this year was communication between the 

That's a kind of acceptance that isn't always felt within the Catholic community, due to a lack of awareness and under­standing, Carey said. However, he emphasized that the Catholic Church "does not reject anyone based on orientation." 
More important than orienta­tion is personal worth as a human, Carey said. 
"One of the things ... is realiz­ing the dignity that everyone is created with, within God's image," Carey said. "That dignity is to be lived out within the Notre Dame community." 
Both Carey and Heck said the retreat's emphasis would not be specifically on Catholicism, but. rather on considering faith in a personal journey. Organizers also hope to help students "explore the inclusive spirit and 
Freshman Class Council and the actual freshman class," presiden­tial candidate Vento said. 
Vento also said this year's Freshman Class Council "wasn't a good representation of the class" since freshmen voted so early in the first semester. 
Mathews criticized the lack of transparency this year. 
"This year's Freshman Class Council did a lot of good things, but [the freshmen] didn't really know what was going on or what was happening during proceed­ings," Mathews said. 
This dissati<.;faction with current conditions motivated some of the tickets. 
"We wanted to offer a different ehoice than is usually available. We wanted to present a ticket of students who were responsible in doing their job, but would also have fun with it and really relate to students," presidential candi­date Landry said. 
Kozlow is hoping for at least 50 percent turnout by freshmen to vote for their class council. 
"Since it's their first time to real­ly vote [for their class council lead­ers), they're hopefully going to take it seriously," she said. 
Freshmen will be able to vote Monday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. on the Judicial Council web site. 
As for the unanimously chosen Junior and Senior Class Council tickets, the election process was much smoother. But new class presidents Keating -who also writes news for The Observer ­and Heish said they were not as surprised as Kozlow about run­ning unopposed. 
"We feel we've proved our­selves. We didn't need to beat another ticket this year to prove that," said Keating, who served as junior class president this year. 
"I think it just attests to how we did this year," said Reish, the class vice president during both his freshman and sophomore years. "Our ticket definitely deserved it since we:re very experienced." 
Reish said his ticket was com­posed of individuals from "a wide variety of groups on campus." lie plans to "hit the ground running" and not only plan events for the rising junior class but also "focus on co-sponsoring events with other classes." 
Keating praised the Judicial Council and Kozlow tor how they handled the elections. 
"I've always known the Judicial Council and Liz Kozlow to act pro­fessionally and in accordance with the [Senate] Constitution," she said. 
Keating said she looks forward to focusing on "both those time­honored Notre Dame traditions and ones that the Class of 2008 has already made their own." 
"We're class council veterans and dedicated to serving the class with diverse talents and perspec­tives,'' she said.

IN BRIEF 
Fewer seek unemployment benefits 
WASHINGTON -The number of laid-off 
workers filing for unemployment benefits 
dropped sharply last week after having been 
driven higher the previous week by storm­
related layoffs. 
The Labor Department reported that appli­cations for jobless benefits totaled 332,000 last week, down by 27,000 from the previous week. 
The prior week jobless claims had jumped by 46,000, the biggest one-week increase since September 2005 in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Part of that big increase occurred because of winter storms that boosted layoffs in such industries as con­struction. 
The four-week moving average for claims edged up from 326,700 to 328,000, the high­est level for this average since early December. 
But economists cautioned that the current jobless claims figures may just reflect the difficulty the government has in seasonally adjusting the numbers at this time of year when major winter snowstorms can alter the number of people showing up at claims offices in any one week. 
Ignored finances worsen tax process 
NEW YORK-Compiling a small business income tax return is rarely a pleasant experience, but for those company owners who have neglected their finances for the past year, it can be torture. 
Typically, the owners who struggle the most have poor records or discover during the course of filling out the return they don't havc the cash to pay their tax bills. Chances are, an owner in eithnr scenario doesn't have a good handle on the overall business, let alone the company's taxes. 
"It's very hard to run a business without reliable financial information," said Gregg Wind, a certified public accountant with Wind Bremer Hackenberg LLP in Los Angeles. "You could be spending too much in a certain area, or set goals in a certain area, but you 'II never know how you are doing." 





Analysts: Apple unlikely to share 
Cisco Systems primarily sought collaboration in trademark-infringement dispute 
Associated Press 
SAN JOSE -The short­

Cisco Systems Inc. and Apple 
Inc. over the "iPhone" name

Instead, the networking gear maker said it was trying to pressure Apple to break its attachment to closed, propri­etary systems and begin col­laborating with Cisco on imaginative future products that can communicate with each other. 
But industry analysts said Thursday the settlement between the Silicon Valley tech giants does not mean that Apple will suddenly open up its most lucrative tech­nologies, particularly the iTunes library that has helped catapult Apple into the top ranks of music reta.il­ers worldwide.

"I am very confident, howev­er, that the new and separate ceremony will honor our grad­uate degree recipients in a more meaningful way than the Sunday main commence­ment," he said. 
The decision stemmed from suggestions of faculty mem­bers and deans of other col­
leges, he said. 
The reason for the change, Jenkins said in his letter, was to create an event that could focus more on the accomplish­ments of the graduate stu­dents. 
In the new ceremony, there will be 
time to recognize all doctoral and Master's degree recipi­ents. In addition, there will be time to present the Eli J. and Helen Shaheen Graduate School awards, rather than just listing aloud the winners as has been done in the past. 
Graduate Student Union vice president Amber Handy echoed that reasoning in a posting on the Graduate School Web site. She empha­sized that the change was made to set aside more time to honor graduate student accomplishments. 
Another reason for the sepa­speak more directly to the Master's and Ph.D. recipients.

The implications in terms of attendance changes aren't clear yet, but fewer graduate students at the ceremony could mean more tickets allot­ted to each undergraduate, 
Pace said.

Peanut butter causes salmonella 
Outbreak sickens 329 in 41 states since August; lawsuits to ensue 
Associated Press 
OMAHA, Neb. -Testing of opened peanut butter jars obtained from people sickened by salmonella has confirmed the presence of the dangerous germ, the Centers for Disease Control said Thursday. 
ConAgra Foods Inc. last week recalled all Peter Pan and Great Value peanut butter made at its Sylvester, Ga., plant after feder­al health officials linked the product to a salmonella out­break that has sickened at least 329 people from 41 states since August. No deaths have been confirmed, although a Pennsylvania family filed a law­suit Wednesday claiming a rela­tive died from eating tainted peanut butter. 
Federal officials linked the peanut butter to the outbreak by surveying people who became ill, but until now, there had been no lab results to con­firm the connection. 
State health departments asked sickened people to bring in opened jars of peanut butter for testing, and jars in New York, Oklahoma and Iowa test­ed positive, said Dave Daigle, a spokesman for the CDC in Atlanta. 
"Now the question becomes, how did the salmonella get in the jar," Daigle said. 
ConAgra learned of the test results Thursday, spokesman Chris Kircher said. 
Gary Rodkin, chief executive of Omaha-based ConAgra, said Thursday that the company will take "aJI reasonable steps to remedy the situation." 
"We are truly sorry for any harm that our peanut butter products may have caused," 

Hodkin said in a news release. 
Government and industry offi­cials have said the contamina­tion may have been caused by dirty jars or equipment. Peanuts are usually heated to high, germ-killing temperatures dur­ing the manufacturing process. The only known salmonella out­break in peanut butter_ in Australia during the mid-1990s _ was blamed on unsanitary plant conditions. 
ConAgra has said none of its previous routine testing of plant equipment and peanut butter has tested positive for salmonel­la. The Food and Drug Administration last inspected the plant in February 2005 and found no problems. 
The Sylvester plant is the sole maker of the nationally distrib­uted Peter Pan brand, and the recall covers all peanut butter produced by the plant since May 2006. Shoppers are being asked to toss out jars having a product code on the lid begin­ning with "2111," which denotes the plant. The jars or their lids can be returned to the store where they were pur­chased for a refund. 
Great Value peanut butter is a Wal-Mart Stores Inc. house brand made by several manu­facturers. Great Value peanut butter that does not have the "2111" code is not included in the recall. 
Salmonella, which commonly originates from the feces of birds and animals, sickens about 40,000 people a year in the U.S. and kills about 600. Jt can cause diarrhea, fever, dehy­dration, abdominal pain and vomiting. 
In the Pennsylvania case, the family of Roberta Barkay alleges in a negligence and wrongful-death lawsuit against ConAgra that salmonella-taint­ed peanut butter killed her and sickened her husband and daughter. 
Barkay, 76, had been hospi­talized with gastrointestinal problems, then developed a bacterial infection before she died Jan. 30, said her lawyer, Rob Peirce. 
Her husband, William, was sick with similar symptoms late last year, after the Barkays bought the peanut butter, according to the lawyer and the lawsuit. Their daughter also got sick after eating the peanut but­ter while at her parents' home for her mother's funeral, Peirce said. 
Roberta Barkay was not test­ed for salmonella, but Peirce said the peanut butter the fami­ly ate was part of the batch ConAgra recalled last week. The lawsuit seeks unspecified dam­ages. 
"We're working to get in touch with that plaintiff's attor­ney to learn all we can," Kircher said Thursday. He said he couldn't comment on the specifics of the lawsuit. 
Across the country, at least four other lawsuits claim negli­gence by the company led to the salmonella illnesses. 
To get a refund, consumers can return the product at the place of purchase or mail in lids with their names and addresses to CdnAgra Foods, P.O. Box 3768, Omaha, NE 68103. For more information, call (866) 344-6970 or visit ConAgra's Web site at http://www.cona­grafoods.com

Editorial
Andrichik informed representatives of the dis­explicitly clarifies the voting provisions in the 
crepancy. In fact, senators must vote accord­ing to their dorm's results. A senator only chooses his own preference when a dorm's tally results in a tie. 
After sorting out the mess, the Senate voted behind closed doors Sunday, following constitutional protocol. But that procedure is problematic. 
First, if senators are obliged to follow the dorm's results, why are the votes kept secret? Some students found out whom their senator voted for; others didn't. With the cur­rent process, every student deserves the right to know which candidate his dorm picked and an open Senate hear­ing to ensure accountability. All that the closed door keeps out of the voting is oversight to guard against political maneuvering and votes contrary to the dorms' tallies. This

If student government wants to mean something at Notre Dame, it must be transparent. The current voting proce­dures are anything but. 
The system is broken -it is inefficient, unorganized and unnecessary. It's time student leaders fix those problems and address the issues that prompt so many students to: take the time to vote "abstain." 
If they cannot meet the challenge, their inability to enact change will tell students that apathy is indeed the best response to student government.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 



Support earned for basketball's final home game 
Going into this season, the Notre Dame men's basketball team was all about question marks. Would they finally play good defense? Would they finally rebound? Coach Mike Brey was viewed as a "dead man walk­ing," and there wasn't much enthusi­asm about the prospects for the season because the team was expected to disappoint. 
The results so far this year have been anything but disap­pointing. They're in fourth place in the Big East, and playing a very exciting brand of basketball. Energy and enthusiasm are evident on both ends of the court. 
Their game on Saturday is critical. Marquette is one of Notre Dame's biggest hard­wood rivals. Saturday's game will be the 1 08th between the schools, which is more games than Notre Dame has played against any other program. A win against the Golden Eagles likely will sew up both a bye in the first round of the Big East Tournament and an NCAA bid, not to mention put the team within five wins of the all-time record for consecutive victories at the Joyce Center. And the game will be broadcast to more than three quarters of the nation on 1\BC. 
The team needs an intimidating home court to help get a win, and the program needs to be shown to a national television audience as vibrant if it wants to continue to

Neither a just war nor just the war 
Sometimes even the most penetrat­ing conversation, the most illuminating ideas, seem mere distraction from a darker truth at which one cannot bear to look. Just when we think we are addressing a grave problem, we find James our deepest sor­Matthew rows hide some­Wilson where else, a few syllables beyond The Treasonous what we are capa­Clerk ble of saying. For instance, this last Tuesday, I sat in on a panel discussing "Requiem," the new exhibit of photographs from the Vietnam War being held at the Snite Museum of Art. The. photos included in the exhibit were taken by journalists who died in that war. Throughout the proceedings, for all my interest, I felt something heavy in my gut. 
The invited speakers probed the question of how a photograph, an image, relates to the reality of war it represents. David Griffith addressed primarily the photos at the center of the Abu Ghraib Prison scandal. In his recent book, "A Good War Is Hard to Find," Griffith argues that those now infamous pictures of Iraqi prisoners forced to pose in humiliating positions in fact betray an obsession with pornography and violence beating at the heart of American culture. The snapshots do not merely expose the imaginations of a few sick persons. They are not merely symptoms of the frustration and anxiety inevitable to soldiers during wartime. Those prison­ers piled naked on top of each other, or leashed to a smirking Lynndie England, Griffith suggests, testify to a culture that feeds on spectacle, the more obscene the better.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Academic freedom 'alive and well' 
A year ago the University community wa.;; engaged in a debate over academic freedom. The campus performance of "The Vagina Monologues" was the focal point of that debate. As an alum I welcomed the opportunity to con­tribute to the discussion and offered my thoughts in a letter to University President Father John Jenkins. I suggested then that Notre Dame could and should offer so much more to the discussion surrounding violence against women than an annual performance of"Monologues" could pro­vide. I suggestRd a broader "conference" setting which could include a variety of opportunities for dialogue, including not only the "The Vagina Monologues" but also the Edith Stein Project and others yet to be identified. 
Well, last fall an original production called "Her Loyal Daughters" was offered in an aca­demic setting. The Edith Stein Project returns for il'> second year next week. And "Monologu£'s" will be offered off campus next month. I believe that academic freedom i'> alive and well at Notre Dame, and the topic of vio­lence against women is getting more and more attention that it certainly deserves. Well done, Notre Dame. 
Jack Fremeau alumnus Class of 1971 Feb. 16 
al decay that silently frames the Abu Craib photos provides an analogy to my own discomfort with the panel at the Snite. The panelists had been invit­ed to talk about war and war photog­raphy. In the daily news cycle, myriad journalists and politicians chatter of whether the President's strategy is failing, has already failed, or can be rehabilitated. Sometimes one hears debate over whether a war to topple a longtime dictator was just. Sometimes one hears debate over whether a pre­emptive war is just. And occasionally one even hears questioned whether any war could ever be just. 
From our elected leaders, we hear clumsy or oddly speculative rhetoric. Sen. Kerry suggests that poor grades will get one sent to Iraq, and then he apologizes. Sen. Obama indicates that soldiers who die there have wasted their lives, and then recants. Sen. Reid speaks of this war as a foreign policy "mistake." 
As the war gets worse, the press spins ever faster from its bowels new analysis and rhetoric about certain features of it. As public opinion turns ever more against it, democratic sena­tors stick their polemical toes in the pond to test the waters of opinion, venturing bold statements about the injustice being done to our troops only to retract them in a day or two. The subject of all this talk is of course the war, but what it dances around it much more serious. 
Some irrational persons would prob­ably oppose any war any government waged. Some wise persons are partic­ularly able at determining when a country has met the criteria for a just­war. And finally, just about everyone now feels comfortable second-guessing the Bush-Rumsfeld strategy in Iraq. 

These speculations, obvious in impor­tance though they are, have the effect of keeping our minds focused "just" on the war. They keep our minds turning about the war as if it were a photo­graph to be studied, with one viewer complaining about the exposure and another that it isn't a painting in oils. 
Behind or beyond that photograph is a vision so dim that, as a nation, we can't look at it for more than a moment. We can talk about this war as often and in as many ways as we like, but most of that talk will remain dis­traction from this vision: that is, from our suspicion, indeed, our probable cause to believe, that we are at war because the Bush administration deceived Congress and lied to the American people. 
One cannot call the Iraq war a "mis­take." To do so, one would have to be in basic agreement with the priorities and goals of the Bush Administration, and to call this or that particular course an "error" that hinders its reaching those goals. More than an error in strategy or one poor executive decision is at stake in Iraq. 
We are at war not because our gov­ernment believed strongly in the just preemption of a madman, or the just removal of an autocrat. We are at war be_cause certain members of our gov­ernment want to ensure that the 
. United States remains the dominant military and economic power in the world, and to do that we need the sup­port of the Saudi government, Saudi oil and the continuation of an other­wise incapacitated and chaotic Middle East. We are at war because (pardon 
the crass nomenclature) neo-conserva­tives believe American interests are the world's interests, .and because executives in the military-industrial 
complex accept that other Americans 
need to be sacrificed for their inter­
ests. This war is an incidental episode 
in the long and programmatic expan­

sion of a teetering empire. It is not just 
the war that is the problem, but the 
program. And thus, we are at war 
because of greed and because of lies. 

An intrinsic duty of any state is to protect the life and common good of its people. War i9 sometimes a just instru­ment for the exercise of that duty. But the Bush administration has rendered such axioms superfluous. War is not the issue. The details of this war are not the issue. What distracted me last Tuesday and sickens me as I write is the fact that no honest philosophical or political debate can matter right now. 
I fear that lurking behind every pho­tograph of every fallen American sol­dier is the dark print of a deceit. Just as a widespread, little discussed, obsession with the obscene lurks behind the images from Abu Ghraib, a narrow and secretive hunger for money and power haunts -and betrays -the portraits of the dead. It is a hunger so vile even Americans will not look at it straight. Some few corpo­rations and persons, to perpetuate a political and economic system that benefits them at the expense of mil­lions, do not care how much ink gets spilled discussing this war, or how much blood gets spilled in it, so long as they are left quietly to profit, just beyond the photo's edge.

Questioning the value of meatless dining halls 
Sacrifice should not affect paying non-Catholics 
As a recovering Catholic, I understand the whole Lent thing. I get that, as an act of sacrifice, Catholics are encour­aged to fast on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday, as well as refraining from eating meat on Ash Wednesday and all Fridays during Lent. I think that's fine, just great. My ques­tion is, why don't they serve meat in the dining halls on Fridays or on Ash Wednesday? It's true that, as a Catholic university, maintaining a Catholic identity is important, but there is a difference between maintaining a Catholic identi­ty and needlessly limiting the options of the student body. 
If there was a tradition that on Holy Thursday everything you eat had to contain meat, and the dining hall made sure every item it offered had meat in it, vegetarians would be up in arms, and rightly so. We paid for a meal plan expect­ing that each meal offered would have a balanced selection of foods, and this is not what we are getting. 
I know some people will say that I could just go to Reekers or LaFortune, and this is true, but this is beside the point. I shouldn't have to spend Flex Points because my din­ing hall refuses to offer proper balanced meals. If the din­ing hall wants to refuse meat to the student body in order to avoid tempting those who choose not to eat it, that's fine -but they should discount those meals, because they clearly aren't as complete, and give me some of my damn money back. 
Greg Howard junior Alumni Hall Feb.21 
True meaning of _sacrifice lost 
·This Lenten season, just like last Lenten season, 
I sure will miss meat on Fridays. Yeah, its hard 
giving up those delicious homestyle chicken pat-· 
ties, but showing repentance is a vital part of 
Lent. This year though, it just won't mean as . 
much. I'm still going to deny myself on Fridays, of 
course, it's just that so will everybody else on cam­
pus whether they want to or not. They don't have 
a choice-the dining halls don't serve meat on 
Fridays. 
I have multiple problems with this. Mainly, the 
sacrifice of abstaining on Fridays becomes entirely 
unremarkable. Not just because everyone else is 
doing it -my penance is entirely between God 
and myself-but because it just seems too easy. 
It's no longer proving anything. To show that 
you're truly sorry for your sins, you should have to 
make a conscious decision to abstain, and you 
sh'Juld be strictly devoted to following through. 
This year, Notre Dame is making that decision 
for us, and making it almost impossible to not fol­·low through. Self.denial should be difficult to be meaningful, and this year it is neither. So please, 
dining halls, save Lent and serve meat on Fridays. 
Catholics and non-Catholics alike will be grateful.

DVD REVIEWS 
Latest release enlivens timeless 'Paradiso' 
By BRIAN DOXTADER 
Scene Editor 
Giuseppe Tornatore's 1988 film "Cinema Paradiso" is a movie about the movies, made for movie lovers. A fondly nostalgic look at the power of the cinema in a small Italian setting, "Paradiso" originally opened to excellent commercial and critical recep­tion, and it remains one of the cinema's most beloved treasures. The film has just been re-released in a lavish Limited Collector's Edition, which includes two dif­ferent versions of the film. 
Set in a sleepy village in Post-WWII Italy, "Cinema Paradiso" is the story of a boy named Salvatore (Salvatore Cascio), who finds refuge from the grim harshness of reality in the world of cinema. He befriends the town's film projectionist, the curmud-· geonly Alfredo, whose job is to censor all the "kissing parts" of films. "Paradiso" then jumps to an adolescent Salvatore (Marco Leonardi), who falls in love with the beauti­ful Maria (Antonella Attili), only to have his heart broken. Years later, an older and wiser Salvatore (Jaeques Perrin) returns to his home village to say goodbye to an old 




'Maltese Falcon' remains prototypical'film nair' 
It's easy to see why "The Maltese Falcon" made a star out of Bogart. He epitomizes "hard-boiled" protagonist, with a certain toughness and intelligence to go along with his razor-sharp wit. The film is deeply engaging because while everyone is trying to outsmart everyone else, Bogart always seems to be one step ahead. Spade's detached, almost aloof attitude and always­professional demeanor put even Quentin Tarantino's screen heroes to shame. 
Of course, the film holds up due to Hammett's original novel being as good as it was. "The Maltese falcon" adheres pret­ty faithfully to the book, and there's a shocking amount of cynicism, especially for Hollywood in 1941. It's amazing to think that 'The Maltese Falcon" was released in the same year as "Citizen Kane" and only a year before "Casablanca." This trio of films illustrates just how sophisticated Hollywood was capable of being during this time, and how adult and far removed from treacly sentimentalism it had become in the post-Depression era. 
The new three-disc special edition of "The Maltese Falcon" is a huge improve­ment over the original one-disc release. The picture, which has been digitally transferred from "restored elements," looks very clean, especially for a film 
that is over 60 years old. The audio is, appropriately enough, the original mono track, which also sounds quite good with clear, up-front dialogue. 
Special features include a commen­tary by Bogart biogra­pher Eric Lax, which

"The Maltese Falcon" is the prototypical "film noir," a gritty and hard-boiled detec­tive story with a stone-faced star and dou­ble-crossing femme fatales. The film made stars out of Humphrey Bogart and director John Huston, both of whom would go on to make a number of classic films. Warner has just released "The Maltese falcon" in a three-disc special edition set loaded with special features, many ofwhich help illumi­nate the film's context and impact. 
The 1941 version of "The Maltese Falcon" is actually the second film based on the eponymous novel by Dashiell Hammett, though Huston's film is considered far superior to the previous version. The plot revolves around San Francisco private eye Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart}, who is asked for protection by the mysterious Miss Wonderly (Mary Astor). When Spade's part­ner turns up dead, he finds himself embroiled in an international scandal involving Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre) and Ka-.per Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet), all of whom are searching for a jewel-encrusted statue, the "Maltese Falcon" ofthe title.

friend. 
"Cinema Paradiso" is a warm, memo­rable film with an excellent setting and warm performances. Coupled with a great score by the legendary Ennio Morrico~e (who also -composed the scores for "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly" and "The Untouchables," among other classics}, the nostalgic images hearken back to a lost age. Almost 20 years later, the film contin­ues to resonate, which is a clear testament to both it-. cinematic grace and its timeless­ness. 
The Limited Collector's Edition is a well­made set that does justice to the fllm's clas­sic status. The film has already been released twice on DVD -once in its original cut, and once in the "new version" (or director's cut) in 2002. This new set is com­prised oftwo DVDs and a CD ofMorricone's score, along with some one-sheet and lobby card reproductions. The set also includes a pair of new documentaries: "Exploring a Timeless Classic," which explains the impact that "Cinema Paradiso" has had on subsequent filmmaking, and "Little Italy Love Story: Cinema Paradiso Style." The extras are worthwhile additions, but the film itself is the main draw to the package. 
The second disc houses the original 170-minute director's cut, which was origi­nally released in America in 2002. Unfortunately, this is a case in which the longer cut is not an improvement, as it eschews the focus of the two-hour theatri­cal version, causing the film to drag at

times. In some ways, it does enrich the development and depth of the story, espe­cially in terms of character, but the overall pacing suffers tremendously. The original is · superior, especially since it is this version of "Paradiso" that has become such a highly regarded classic. 
Oddly enough, the picture and audio quality differ between cuts. Both cuts are presented in anamorphic widescreen, but the director's cut looks sharper and cleaner 
(perhaps due to its more recent release). It also has a 5.1 Dolby Digital track, which sounds much richer and fuller, as opposed to the theatrical cut's 2.0 Dolby Surround. Both versions are in Italian, with English subtitles. 
"Cinema Paradiso" is a cla'lsic -a film that truly celebrates the movies. The Weinstein Company's new edition immedi­ately usurps previous DVD editions and renders them obsolete. It's easily the best way to experience "Paradiso," a film that will likely enthrall viewers for generations to come.

is informative but heavily leans toward information about Bogart rather than the film. It's unfortunate that Warner was unable to get critic Roger Ebert to do a commentary, a-. his tracks for "Casablanca" and "Citizen Kane" are both phenomenal. More information about Hammett would also have been welcome, though Lax's knowledge of Bogart is impressive. 
There is also a substantial amount of archival material, including several inter­esting shorts, trailers and information about 1941, which gives the film another layer of context. There's also a documen­tary, "The Maltese Falcon: One Magnificent Bird," which forms the bulk of one of the special features discs. The onJy disappoint­ing aspect of the set (and really, it's a minor nitpick) is that there is a lack of information regarding Huston. 
'The Maltese Falcon" has finally gotten the treatment it deserves on DVD. As the archetypal film noir, it still holds up over half a century later, thanks to the sure­handed direction of Huston and the iconic performance of Bogart. The three-disc spe­cial edition comes highly recommended.

Anna Nicole, Paris Hilton redefine 'celebrity' 
Marilyn Monroe is arguably America's first and most recognized celebrity icon. She dominated the 1950s with her terrific movie career, and, although she was a tal­ented actress, she is perhaps better known for being the original "blonde bombshell." She appeared in the very first edition of "Playboy," was mar­ried to both Joe DiMaggio and Arthur Miller and was rumored to have h·ad an affair with President Kennedy (her friendship with the president also spawned one of the greatest renditions of "Happy Birthday"). 
Flash forward to 1992, when small-town American girl Vickie Lynn was discovered by Hugh Hefner and decided to make a name for herself. And make a name for herself she did: Anna Nicole Smith. In the vein of Marilyn, Anna Nicole modeled for Playboy and was infamous for her mar­riage to an 89-year old billionaire oil tycoon. Where Marilyn legitimately made herself into a star through her popular film career, Anna Nicole was famous solely for being herself. She later went on to have her own reality television show ("The Anna Nicole Show") and became the spokesper­
. son for Trimspa, a dubious weight loss drug. Despite these "achievements," she never had the same amount of true per­sonal success that Marilyn enjoyed, despite being a bona fide celebrity. Essentially, she was popular for being popular. 

Erin McGinn 
Assistant Scene Editor 
The "Anna Nicole syndrome," where celebrities are seemingly created out of nothing, is an omnipresent phenomenon today. New stars are promoted daily out of the rising success of reality television shows. People like Trista Rehn and Ryan Sutter ("The Bachelorette"), Amber Brkich and Rob Mariano ("Survivor: All-Stars") and Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth ("The Apprentice") are famous for being famous, even though they arguably accomplished nothing. 
At the pinnacle of this talent-free mix sits the reigning queen, Paris Hilton. Daughter of a hotel monarch, Paris lived the innocuous life of a decadent socialite until she decided that she wanted to be famous. In 2001, Paris came into power as the quintessential party girl. When her first sex tape ("1 Night in Paris"} was "released" in 2003, she solidified her place at the center of the pop culture universe. Falling victim to the "Anna Nicole syn­drome," Paris has tried to move on to some semblance of a "real" career. 
She has starred in Fox's reality series 'The Simple Life" with fellow celebutante Nicole Ritchie, playing off of their public persona.'> as talented, spoiled socialites. She has also acted in films ("House of Wax" and the upcoming "The Hottie and the Nottie"), recorded an album ("Paris"), "designed" perfumes and even partially wrote a book, the aptly titled "Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose." 
So what happens to these celebrities when they·have no talent to fall back on? Networks like MTV constantly feature legions of contestants seeking their 15 min­utes, then doing whatever they can to

Spears' struggles raise concern among fans 
Nine years ago, no one would have thought that Britney Spears -the former Mouseketeer-would be on the brink of total breakdown. 
Along with fellow Mouseketeer alums Justin Timberlake, J.C. Chasez and Christina Aguilera, Britney burst onto the late nineties pop scene with near­instant success. She was quickly dubbed a princess of pop and experienced an un­precedented level of growth in popularity with her albums " ... Baby One More Time," "Oops! ... I Did It Again" and "Britney." 
Starting in 1998, America swooned over the young love between Britney and Justin. Too good to be true, their four-year relationship fell apart in 2(X)2, and Britney's slow but steady derailment began soon thereafter. 
Although she continued in her music career, recording "In the Zone," she also did things that the " ... Baby One More Time" Britney never would have dreamed of. In 2003, a newer, edgier Britney kissed pop icon Madonna on stage at the MTV Video Music Awards. She shocked the world in 2004 when she married her child­hood sweetheart Jason Alexander in a spontaneous ceremony at the Uttle White Wedding Chapel in Vega.'> -a union that was annulled less than 55 hours later. America started to worry about their pop princess. 
She was still all right, though -fans believed that Brit could still get her life baek on track. The down-home heroine of

teenage girls across the States, who prided herself on her wholesome image and fiercely maintained her alleged virginity, had once been at the height of popularity. Brit certainly wasn't the rrr.st celebrity to think that an ill-fated Vegas wedding was a smart idea, and most fans seemed willing to excuse her antics with the hope that she might return to top form. 
Enter K~Fed. 
Apparently seeking the polar opposite of Justin, Britney began her ill-fated relation­ship with her back-up dancer, Kevin Federline. She was engaged only six months after her overnight wedding mis­take, and eight months later she was mar­ried ... again. Her tumble from her promi­nent place·in the eyes of the public picked up speed. 
Britney abandoned her music career in favor of starting a family. Her hubby had gotten a head start on her with one child -and another baby on the way -with actress Shar Jackson. Britney and Kevin, in light of fellow celebrity couple Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson's success, decided to star in their own reality show on M1V in 2005, "Britney and Kevin: Chaotic," which ended after five episodes. Later that year, Britney gave birth to her first child, Sean Preston. 
It didn't take long for Britney to sink into controversy over her parenting skills, with tabloid pictures of her driving with her infant son sitting in her lap beginning to surface. She used the plea that she grew up in the country to defend her actions, argu­ing that she was a good mother in an inter­view with Matt Lauer. 
A year later she gave birth to her second son, Jayden James, and only a couple of months after his birth, Britney and Kevin filed for divorce in November of 2006. 


Three months later, the princess of pop seemingly fell off the brink of sanity. A week ago, Britney checked in and out of rehab in less than 24 hours. The next day she walked into a hair salon and asked to have her head shaved. After employees refused, she went to the back of the salon and shaved it herself (if you have a million dollars, you can buy some of her hair on buybritneyshair.com). Britney has recently been spotted in a heinous, ill-fitting blonde wig. She even tried rehab again -for 24 more hours. 
The latest rumor is that she shaved her head in a panicked move to avoid drug testing threatened by K-Fed in order to gain custody of their two sons. In response to Kevin's allegations, Britney must remain in rehab for at least 30 days to retain cus­tody of her children. Prior to her entering rehab, there were photos taken of her beating on K-Fed's SUV with an umbrella. 
To both fans and critics alike, there appears to be something justifiably wrong with poor Britney Spears. Unfortunately for her, her cries for help are becoming little more than tabloid fodder.

Associated Press 
AUSTIN, Texas -Dennis Johnson, the star NBA guard who was part of three championship teams and combined with Larry Bird in one of the 1-,rreat postseason plays, died Thursday after collapsing at the end of practice while coaching a developmental team. He was 52. 
Johnson, coach of the Austin Toros, was uncon­scious and in cardiac arrest when paramedics arrived at Austin Convention Center, said Warren Hassinger, spokesman for Austin-Travis County Emergency Medical Services. 
Paramedics tried to resus­citate him for 23 minutes before he was taken to a ho~pital and pronounced dead, Hassinger added. Mayrc. Freeman, a spokes­woman for the medical examiner's office, said there will be autopsy. 
The Toros postponed home games Friday and Saturday nights, the NBA Development League said. 
Johnson, a five-time All­Star and one of the top defensive guards, was part of the last Boston Celtics dynasty. He spent 14 sea­sons in the league and retired after the 1989-90 season. He played on title teams with the Celtics in 1984 and 1986 and with the Seattle SuperSonics in 1979, 
IN BRIEF 
Kidd stays with Nets as NBA 
trade deadline passes 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. ­Jason Kidd remained with the New Jersey Nets as the NBA trade deadline passed Thursday amid concerns about his health. 
The team confirmed reports on Thursday that Kidd has a cracked rib in addition to the back injury 
that  forced  him  to  miss  two  
·games  and  the  NBA  All-Star  
game.  

Nets coach Lawrence Frank defended the team's decision not to publicize the rib injury, saying it didn't force Kidd to miss any games and was only discovered when Kidd's back was being examined. 
"The implication was that it was being concealed, which would be a falsehood," Frank said. "We're not going to disclose every nick, bruise or bump that's not pre­venting a guy from playing." 
when he was the NBA final<> 
MVP. 
"Whether he was leading his teams to NBA champi~ onships or teaching young men the meaning of profes­sionalism, Dennis Johnson's contributions to the game went far beyond the basket­ball court," NBA commis­sioner David Stern said. 
'"Dennis was a man of extraordinary character with a tremendous passion for the game." 
Johnson was a favorite teammate of Bird's, and the two w ere part of one of the most memorable plays in Celtics history. 
During the fifth game of the 1987 Eastern Confer­ence finals against Detroit, Bird stole Isiah Thomas' inbounds pass under Boston's basket and fed Johnson, who drove in for the winning layup. Boston won the series in seven games but lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA finals. 
"Dennis was a great play­er, one of the best team­mates I ever had, and a wonderful person," said Bird, now president of the Indiana Pacers. "My thoughts and condolences are with his family at this difficult time." 
Bill Laimbeer, the center on that Pistons team, remembered Johnson as a "great player on a great ballclub." 

Piazza starts training with the 
A's as full-time DH 
PHOENIX. Az. -Mike Piazza appears perfectly comfortable with his new gig, even if he's really not. 
He smiled Thursday as he made his way onto the field minus catching gear for the first time in his career, the last member of the Oakland Athletics to get outside for stretching as he embarked on becoming a full-time designated hitter. 
At 38, Piazza is ready to begin a new baseball life. The A's don't want him to catch at all to ensure that he stays healthy -and man­ager Bob Geren asked him to take it easy in drills Thursday. 
Piazza stood in the back of the group once he was on the field, doing some warming up on his own before the A's got going because he couldn't stay still on Day 1. 
Ripken receives reception
from House Speaker 
ANNAPOLIS, Md. -Cal Ripken received a big reception from Maryland lawmakers on Thursday, a month after being voted into baseball's Hall of Fame. 
House Speaker Michael Busch, who said he had tried to recruit Ripken for the House of Delegate's basketball team, introduced him as "one of Maryland's great sons." 
Hipken, who spent his baseball career with the Baltimore Orioles, got a big standing ovation from lawmakers. He told them the last time he received that big of an ovation, he had to run around Camden Yards, referring to when he bro·ke Lou Gehrig's consecu­tive-games played record. 
"You don't expect me to take a lap do you?" Ripken said. ''I'll say what. I said then: 'I don' t think I can make it.'"

Scott Vitter def. John

Vitter defeated Williams by 
unanimous decision after 
three intense rounds. 
Vitter, a freshman from 
Alumni, and Williams, a jun­

even first round, both 
exchanging punches. In the 
second round the fight 
became a brawl, with both 
fighters tiring and letting 
down their defensive guards. 
Vitter opened the final round 
with a strong effort, landing 
multiple punches to the jaw 
of Williams. Both fighters 
ended a strong third round 
with blood dripping from 
their faces after a hard­
fought battle.

Kantor defeated McConvey when the referee ended the fight after two rounds. 
Both fighters came out swinging in a sloppy first round, with Kantor, a Keough sophomore, bloodying McConvey's nose early in the round. McConvey, a freshman from Zahm, closed the first round with more patience ­and blood seeping from his nose. Both fighters were more patient and defensive in a much cleaner second round, but McConvey's bleed­ing nose caused the referee to end the fight at the round's conclusion. 
Brendan Neary def. Andrews

Neary defeated Massari in a unanimous decision after three rounds. 
Alumni sophomores Neary and Massari fought a very clean first round, with both fighters holding up their defenses and throwing strate­gic blows. Both came out more aggressively in the sec­ond round, but Massari appeared to hold the advan­tage throughout. The third round was a very even con­test, with both fighters show­ing incredible fitness and landing strong punches.

round. 
Both Ward and Allare 
fought a very technical first 
round, each boxer probing 
for the other's weakness. In 
the second round, Ward, an 
off-campus senior, appeared 
to take control, drawing 
blood from Allare and tem­
porarily stopping the fight. 
Allare, a Keenan sophomore, 
fought hard but was not 
allowed to continue after two 
hard-fought rounds. 
Adam "Alpha Fox" Frisch 
def. Chris Schaal 
Frisch, a senior from St. Edward's, appeared to win the first round, landing many well-placed punches and staying out of reach of Schaal's blows. The second round featured more of the same, with Schaal, a fresh­man from Dillon, unable to land a solid blow. Frisch stayed in control during the third round to ensure the vic­tory. 
Alex Lough def. Steve 
Gallagher 
Lough appeared to be in control after a solid first round, taking advantage of Gallagher's wild punches. Gallagher, a senior from Stanford, landed a few glanc­ing blows in the second, but still seemed behind. Lough and Gallagher exchanged blows in the third round, with Gallagher taking the worst of the beating. 
Tom Digan def. Ken 
Shamrell

MEN'S LACROSSE 
No. 11 Irish travel to Happy Valley 

By PAT O'BRIEN Sporrs Writer 

A week after an impressive home victory against then-No. 13 Loyola (Md.), the Notre Dame men's lacrosse team will travel to Happy Valley, Penn., to take on Penn State this Sunday at 1 p.m. The Irish will 
try to start strong on the road after finishing 4-5 away from home last year. 
Notre Dame (1-0} used last week to prepare for the Nittany Lions. Usually, the Irish face Penn State in the season opener, but the matchup is their second game this year. 
"This will be another hard fought game," Irish coach Kevin Corrigan said. "The games against them have been rarely decided by more then a few goals." 
Penn State (0-1} started its season with a 10-5 loss to Denver last weekend. The Lions led 5-3 at halftime but were outscored 7-0 in the sec­ond half. Still, Penn State freshman sensation Chris Hogan made an immediate impact by netting a team-high two goals. 
Along with Hogan, senior captains Pat Heim, Dan Saltsman and Matt Mulqueen will be important factors for the Nittany Lions. 
Penn State received five votes in the latest Inside Men's Lacrosse Magazine Division I Poll, meaning that they have remained in the top 25 teams. Last week, they were placed at 17. 
"Penn State will be hungry to win this one after losing to Denver," Irish junior goalie Joey Kemp said. "We have to travel, and this game should not be taken lightly." 
For senior attacker Brian llubschmann, the game is "a big rivalry." 
Penn State senior attacker Brian Boyle transferred as a freshman from Notre Dame, but Hubschmann said he and Boyle have remained friends. 
"[Our relationship) has added more to the rivalry," Hubschmann said. "It's not bad blood, but he used to go lto 
Notre Dame.] That makes me want to win even more." 
Notes 
+ Joey Kemp was named Great Western Lacrosse League (GWLL) Player of the Week for Feb. 12-18. He played a key part in the victory over Loyola (Md.) by making nine saves and holding the 
Greyhounds scoreless in the last quarter and a half of the game.

MEN'S TENNIS 

Team takes on two top-50 rivals 
By DEIRDRE KRASULA Sports Writer 
Notre Dame \'\ill look to main­tain its home winning streak as it takes on two nationally ranked opponents this weekend. The No. 9 Irish will face off with No. 22 
Michigan today and  No. 45  
Northwestern Sunday.  
Notre Dame (8-2)  returns  

home after a 2-1 showing at the USTNITA National Team Indoor Championships. The Irish fell early on to No. 8 Pepperdinc 4-2, but rallied to post 4-0, 4-1 wins over No. 66 Pennsylvania and No. 16 Texas, respectively. The win over Texas marked the end of a 10-match losing streak against the Longhorns. 
Despite losing to Pepperdine, Notre Dame remained at No. 9 in the ITA team rankings. 
The Irish saw movement in the individual rankings, however. Senior Stephen Bass climbed from No. 14 to No. 11 in singles ranking, and junior Sheeva Parbhu moved from No. 30 to No. 27. Sophomore Brett Helgeson broke the top-1 00 for the first time this season, placing at No. 94. 
Notre Dame saw improved doubles rankings as well. Senior Ryan Keckley and Parbhu broke the top 10, moving from No. 11 to No.9. 
Michigan started its season with a 6-0 run and in the process defeated No. 16 Texas 5-2. The Wolverines only loss came when they fell 2-5 to No. 4 Virginia. Michigan comes to South Bend after defeating Northwestern ­Notre Dame's opponent this Sunday-5-2. 

The Irish will face challenges from the start when Keckley and Parbhu face No. 3 Brian Hung and Matko Maravic. The duo most recently defeated No. 27 Matt Christian and Willy Lock from Northwestern, bringing its record to 7-1. No. 44 Maravic also saw victory at No. 2 singles with a 6-3, 2-6, 6-4 win over Northwestern's Willy Lock. 
Northwestern will host No. 59 Oklahoma today before traveling to take on the Irish in South Bend Sunday. Northwestern's defeat to Michigan marked the third con­secutive loss for the Wildcats, who fell to No. 4 Mississippi and No. 44 Pe1m State. 
Notre Dame will look to take advantage of its home court schedule for the weekend, hop­ing to continue an undefeated streak at home.

Irish head south for tournament 
By DEIRDRE KRASULA Sports Wrirer 
Notre Dame will look to rebound from two consecutive losses to Texas State as it travels to Myrtle Beach, S.C. for the Baseball at the Beach Tournament. The team hopes to find consistency this weekend. 
"I've never had a team play better coming out from inside to outside than we did last Saturday," Notre Dame coach Dave Schrage said. "Sunday we didn't play very well, so it was kind of what team do we have here? Each weekend we will be looking for improvement." 
The Irish won't find any easier challenges in Myrtle Beach this weekend. Notre Dame takes on UNC-Wilmington out of the gate and then faces formidable games against No. 12 Texas Christian as well as Coastal Carolina. The Irish, currently 1-2, will look to get up to at least .500 before con­ference play begins. 
 

"If you look at the history [Notre Dame has) hovered around .500 early in the season and then by thA time conference came around started to play bet­ter," Schrage said. 
The Seahawks will start fresh­man Daniel Cropper to face the Irish in their matchup. 
Notre Dame will be challenged from the mound again on Saturday when it takes on the Horned Frogs. The Irish will face either senior Chance Corgan or sophomore Chris Johnson but will evade the threat of Jake Arrieta. Arrieta -who pitched this summer for Team USA ­will pitch today against Coastal Carolina to open play for the Frogs. 
But Notre Dame has its own power from the mound to counter UNC-Wilmington and TCU. Junior Wade Korpi will likely open the tournament for the Irish when they take on UNC-Wilmington today. Sophomores David Phelps and Brett Graffy will start for Notre Dame on Saturday and 
Sunday, respectively. Schrage is confident in the starting rotation. 
"I like our three starters in our bullpen going down there this weekend against anybody," he said. "I was really pleased with how [our starting pitching] threw [last weekend], and I think as the season evolves you will notice that we have some pitching depth and we have a lot ofguys that we can use." 
Notre Dame heads down to Myrtle Beach with the hopes of improving before the swiftly approaching conference season. Schrage said the team welcomes the opportunity to get as much playing time as it can. 
"We are excited to get outside and play some great teams," he said. 
No. 12 TCU, one of the best overall teams in the country, will certainly test the strength the Irish on all levels.

California to pose challenge on road 
By DAN MURPHY Sporrs Wrirer 
Notre Dame heads west this weekend to play in the Palm Springs Classic for the third time in program history. The Irish are slated to play double­headers this afternoon and Saturday before finishing their trip with an early Sunday morning matchup with Ole Miss. 
The team struggled in its last two appearances at the tournament that consistently draws the top teams in the nation. In its first appearance in Palm Springs, the team went 1-3 with big losses to Pacific (12-1) and the U.S. Olympic team {10-0). The Irish did not fare much better the following year, held to three runs in their first four games

-all losses. However, they 
did salvage the trip by beating 
No. 5 Tennessee 5-2 in the 
final contest. 
"You find out very quickly 
where you are at early in the 
year," Irish coach Deanna 
Gumpf said. "Some things 
aren't eompletely worked out 
but it helps us locate our 
weaknesses early." 
Notre Dame, who opened up 
the season with a 2-5 record 
at the Tiger Invitational last 
weekend, will face tough 
opponents again in California. 
·Today will be the team's 
toughest day as they square 
off against No. 10/12 
Oklahoma and No. 11/17 
California. The Sooners (11-0) 
won their past three games by 
a combined score ·of 37-3. 
Junior centerfielder Jamie Fox 
has led the recent onslaught 
with eight RBI. 
Sophomore pitcher Brittany 
Bargar will have her work cut 
out for her in shutting down 
Fox and the rest of the power­
ful Sooner lineup. Bargar 
went 2-1 last weekend, throw­
ing complete games in both of 
her wins over hosts Auburn 
and Tennessee Tech. 
"We have to slow them down with great pitches," Gumpf said. "If we put the ball in the right places we should be OK." 
Senior Kenya Fuemmeler will get the start in the second game of the day against the Golden Bears. Cal enters the tournament with a 7-4 record and a three-game win streak of its own. However, run pro­duction has been streaky for the Bears so far this season ­they have failed to score more than two runs in five of their games so far. 
Saturday games against UNLV and Cal State Fullerton round out Notre Dame's schedule for the trips. The Irish played both team in the Las Vegas Classic at the start of the 2006 season. They han­dled the Runnin' Rebels with no problems in a 9-3 win. Then-freshman Linda Kohan's second career home run gave the Irish a comfortable lead early in the game. 
The following day, the offense slowed down against Fullerton, losing 3-2 in a pitcher's duel. 
This year another freshman has taken over the home run crown for the Irish. Third­baseman Heather Johnson started out her Notre Dame career with a walk-off home run against Tennessee Tech in only her third collegiate game. 
"She is just a good ball play­er. She didn't get nervous, she was nice and relaxed the whole weekend," Gumpf said. 
Johnson currently leads the Hig East conference in batting average (.500). on base per­centage (.500) and slugging percentage (.750). Her eight hits and four RBI are also both good enough for fifth on the early conference leader board. 
Gumpf said she hopes the Irish can continue to hit well while working out some of last weekend's kinks by shoring up their defense.

Irish look to continue 
wllming streak at home 
The Interrace Forum 
By CHRIS HINE Sports Writer 
After taking on some of the best teams in the nation, the Irish get a break. 
No. 2 Notre Dame will face No. 59 Iowa Sunday at the Eck Tennis Pavilion. The match will be the first for the Irish since defeating No. 20 Wake Forest last Sunday, the third of three wins over top-25 opponents for Notre Dame last week. 
"We still have to work quite a bit on our doubles," Irish coach Jay Louderback said. "Even though we won all three against Wake, we still struggled a little bit against North Carolina." 
The Irish (9-1) defeated the No.5 Tar Heels, the Demon Deacon's and No. 24 Michigan within a span of five days. Against North Carolina, Notre Dame lost the doubles point for only the second time all season. 
"We had all three doubles teams working on things they struggled with," Louderback said. "We worked on different types of pat­terns and shots. [Seniors Christian and Catrina Thompson] were hurt a lot by lobs. We worked on things to counteract the lob." 
Louderback also said he used the time off to heal some injured players, including sophomore Kelcy Tefft, vvho has been suffering from a pulled stomach muscle. 
"Kelcy is close to full strength," Louderback said. "A couple of our players have been sick like every­body else on campus." 
The Irish will try to keep their win streak alive against the

llawkeyes (3-3). Sophomore Merel 
Beelen leads Iowa with a 6-0 dual 
match record this season. 
"Their top three are older and 

have been around, so we've seen 
them some. But their lineup is 
good," Louderback said. "I think 
their lower kids were freshmen a 
year ago and now they're a year 
older. I think they'll be good. They 
seem like they always play well 
against us." 
In the latest version of the ITA 

computer rankings, Notre Dame's 
doubles teams of Thompson and 
Thompson and Tefft and junior 
Brook Buck are ranked No. 5 and 
No. 15, respectively. Catrina 
Thompson rose from her presea­
son ranking of No. 41 to No. 16 
while freshman Colleen Hielley 
slipped from No. 31 to No. 73 in 
singles. 
Missing from the rankings is 

freshman Cosmina Ciobanu. 
Ciobanu is a perfect 10-0 on the 
season and has an overall record 
of 20-4 since joining Notre Dame. 
"We were a little bit surprised. She's beaten kids that arc ranked and hasn't lost a match. That's a little surprising. You just never ·know," Louderback said. "The rankings are strange anyway, especially early in the year. The team rankings are a little better because there's voting, but the individual rankings are dune on computer, so you just never know, 
especially early in the year."

Byers to lead team 

tn season opener 
By MICHAEL BRYAN Sports Writer 
Last year the Notre Dame women's lacrosse team went a perfect 9-0 at home -an achieve­ment the team will try to repro­duce this season, starting with Saturday's home opener against No. 18 Stanford. 
Irish coach Tracy Coyne said the team doesn't plan on the home winning streak ending any time soon. 
"We're taking the streak very seriously," she said. "We always have a lot of pride playing at home." 
The No. 5 Irish (1-0), started the regular season last Saturday with a clutch 10-9 sudden-death over­time win over No. 12 James MadLson. 
The Irish trailed most of game, and were just 19 seconds away from defeat when junior Caitlin McKinney netted an unassisted goal in the final moment., of regu­lation. The Dukes took a 9-7 lead in the opening half of the six­minute overtime period after two goals by senior Kelly Berger. 
Notre Dame responded quickly in the second half of overtime, however, with an early goal by sophomore Jillian Byers. Then, with just nine seconds left in over­time, McKinney scored another clutch goal to tie the game at 9-8 and advance to sudden-death. 
Both teams played strong defense in the sudden-death over­time. 
"Vith 16 seconds remaining sen­ior Lena Zentgraf assisted Byers for the game-winning goal, the sixth of the game for Byers. 
Notre Dame was led by Byers six goals, and McKinney's two clutch goals. Senior Meghan Murphy also added two goals in the winning effort. 
Coyne said the experience against James Madison will help the team going into the match with Stanford. 
"That game gave us confidence, and a motivation to start out fast," Coyne said. "We always play a close game with Stanford and we expect another battle." 
The Cardinal (1-2) started off the regular season with a tough 10-6 loss at Oregon. Stanford then rebounded against Saint Mary's (Cali.) with a dominant 22­6win. 
The Cardinal then dropped their home opener in a 14-8 loss to No. 2Duke. 
In last year's matchup at Stanford, the Irish rallied from a 9-4 deficit for a 12-11 double­overtime win.

FENCING 
Notre Dame keeps up hard work for Duals 
By KEN FOWLER Sports Ediror 
Two days before the team's penultimate regular season com­petition, Notre Dame was going after it. 
The upper third ofjunior epeeist Greg Howard's shirt was drenched in sweat. Senior sabreist Valerie Providenza used the dry spots left on hers to wipe off her brow.. From end to end in the Langford Gym, the Irish went from station to station, working on technique and anaerobic condi­tioning. 
The focus: Work on technique when the body's tiring. "It was very intense training," Irish coach Janusz Bednarski said. 
Bednarski said the Irish would continue to train in short, intense seg·ments as the season draws to a close. 
Howard, whose back looked like an ink blot by its symmetric sweat stain, said the Irish have focused more on conditioning this season than in the past. That training could play a key role in Saturday's 15-team Northwestern Duals in Evanston, Ill. 
The field includes Penn State, Ohio State, Northwestern and Temple. The Nittany Lions own the No. 1 ranking on both the men's and women's side national­ly, and the Buckeyes are No. 2 and No. 5, respectively. The Wildcat women are tied for No. 6, and the Owls are No. 9 on the women's side. 
"It's important that we do well 
FSU 
continued from page 24 
"First of all, Ferris is playing really well in the last month, and secondly is that there are reper­cussions in the big picture." 
The big picture that Jackson referred to was the NCAA Tournament field, which is deter­mined by a NCAA Selection Committee based on a rating sys­tem known as the PairWise Rankings (PWR). 
Notre Dame, despite being No. 1 in all media polls, is currently third in the PWR behind Minnesota and New Hampshire due to a weak strength of sched­ule that has only gotten worse as marquee teams that the Irish have beaten -like Boston College -have struggled this yea~ . 
The PWR are used to deter­mine not only which 16 teams make the Tournament, but also where they are seeded. As long as Notre Dame sits in the top four of the PWR, it wHI receive a No. 1 seed in one of the four regionals when the Tournament begins. 
"Our stren!:,rth of schndule has killed us, arid our strength of schedule is not going to go up this weekend," Jackson said. "So the only way that we can stay where we are, or move up, is to win." 
In practice Thursday, Jackson bore down hard on his players when they could not break the puck out of their defensive zone -a recent problem for the Irish. Jackson said the defensemen have been tentative with the puck, and the forwards responsi­ble for supporting the breakout down low and on the wings have not been there. 
"If anything has come down in our game over the last half of the 
against Penn State because 
they're a big rival of ours," 
Howard said. "I think everybody 
knows what they have to do ­
everybody's pretty focused." 
North Carolina, Wayne State, Johns Hopkins, Cleveland State, Detroit, Fairleigh Dickinson, Lawrence, Michigan and Michigan State also will be competing this weekend. 
For the Irish, traveling to Northwestern rendezvous "'ill be a rematch. The Notre Dame women grabbed a 14-13 victory over the Wildcats in the NYU Duals Jan. 28. On that day, the women's epeeists' 7-2 edge­including senior Amy Orlando's clinching, 4-3 overtime victory in the match's last bout -put the Irish over the top. 
"We had a strong tournament against them," Bednarski said. "Now ... I am sure they are 
.. 
stronger. 

This time, Northwestern coach Laurie Schiller said, the Wildcats' hope to reverse the results. In a telephone interview with The Observer, he said his freshman fencing twins -epeeists Christa and Kayley French -have adjust­ed since the NYU Duals to the ... quick pace of five-touch college bout.c;. 
But Irish junior foilist Rachel Cota said Notre Dame isn't going to be looking back Saturday. 
"Saturday's a new day," she said. "I think everyone is really excited."

season, it's that our puck support is not as good as it was," Jackson said. "Whether it's on the break­out, or in the neutral zone, or on the counterattack or on the 
.. 
eyele. 
Irish captain TJ. Jindra recog­nized that Notre Dame has strug­gled on the breakout lately, but said this weekend will be a chance to fix any problems. 
"Our goal is to be the best we can here at the end and some­times some things are clicking well and sometimes other things aren't clicking that well," Jindra said. "The last couple weeks our breakout has been maybe not that great, but this is another weekend for us to work on it and get ready for the playotls." 
Jackson has not decided if he will deploy Irish goalie Dave Brown for both games or split time with sophomore backup Jordan Pearce, who earned last Saturday's 3-2 overtime win against Alaska. 
"We're going to have thirteen, fourteen days off before our next game. So I want to make sure IBrown is) sharp going into the second round of the playoffs -. because he's not fatigued," Jackson said. "I've had no instinct from him, or from what I see, that he's tired." 
The Irish, who have only lost twice since Dec. 2, will be off next weekend while the fifth through 12th place teams in the CCIIA play best-of-three first round series. The teams will all be re­seeded after the round is over, with top-seeded Notre Dame to play the lowest-remaining seed. 
The puck will drop tonight at 7:35, while Saturday's regular­season finale and Senior Night will begin at 7:05 p.m.

"We have  a  chance to do  

something really impressive Saturday and finish undefeat­ed at home," senior guard Colin Falls said. 
The Golden Eagles come into Saturday's matchup after los­ing three of their last four, but Brey said he thinks Marquette's 80-67 win over Villanova Monday gave them their confidence back. 
"They're back in gear," he said. "They're really, really talented." 
The Golden Eagles are led by sophomore guards Dominic James, Jarel McNeal and Wesley Matthews, who are averaging more than 40 points per game this season. Because

all three are quick, they pres­ent match-up problems for the Irish. 
Freshman Tory Jackson and senior Hussell Carter will probably man-up two of them, while Falls and forward Zach Hillesland will most likely rotate on the third. 
Inside, Marquette is weaker, with junior Ousmane Barro leading the big men with 8.4 points per game. Irish for­wards Hob Kurz and Luke Harangody will look for the ball early and often on offense and will try to clog the lane against the quick guards of the Golden Eagles on defense. 
With Notre Dame's advan­tage in the low post, Brey said he wants to make Saturday's contest a physical struggle similar to the 66-63 Irish vic­tory over Villanova Jan. 27. 
''It'll be really physical, probably Villanova-like," he said. "The two teams are 
going to go at it on Saturday." 
Brey said after the DePaul game that he wanted his team to relax in the days leading up to the showdown with Marquette. He gave the team Wednesday off and scheduled light workouts Thursday and today to make sure they were fresh for Saturday. 
"Our guys are pretty good now," Brey said. "We can pace them and be smart about it." 
In order to keep his team loose, Brey said he down­played the importance of Saturday's game despite the high ranking of the two teams. The Irish are still likely to make the NCAA tournament , he said, and can still get a bye at the Big East tournament even with a loss. 
"It's not the end of the world," he said.

player, pestering opponents all season long. But unlike previous seasons, the senior guard has become increasingly more involved in the Irish's offensive scheme. 
"I think she has really achieved her potential and at times over­achieved what we hoped that she would be for us," McGraw said. 
Although Erwin has not received as much praise as Gray this year, McGraw said the for­ward has played unselfishly all season long. 
"She doesn't care about indi­vidual accolades -she just wants to do whatever she can to help the team," McGraw said. 
In order to prep.are for Saturday's game, McGraw focused her attention on improv­ing the team's offense. She said the most important things to work on are the team's press offense and man-to-man offense because of Hutgers' style of play. 

"It's playing against a team that will be similar to what Tennessee did against us, and we haven't played against teams like that in a while, so we really need to work on playing against a pressure defense," she said. 
With two games remaining in the season, the Irish can clinch a first-round bye in the Big East tournament if they win out. Notre Dame could also clinch with a win and losses from West Virginia and Louisville. 
"It's going to be really difficult to accomplish that with the two teams we have left, we might need some help from some other people," McGraw said. "But it's great to be in control of your own destiny."

HOCKEY 

ND looks to finish strong against Ferris State 
By KYLE CASSILY Sports Writer 

It's been a long time since unranked Notre Dame plucked then-No. 1 Boston College 7-1 in the second game of the season, hut not much has changed for the Irish since that statement game four months ago. 
"When you're winning, [time] always seems to fly by," Irish coach Jeff Jackson said Thursday, a day before his team was set to begin its last regular­season series. "It seems like it drags a little bit more when you're not." 
The No. 1 Irish (26-5-3, 20-3-3 CCI-lA) will play Ferris State (12­19-3, 9-15-2 CCHA) at the Joyce Center this weekend in their last two games before the CCHA tour­nament. 
The Irish will also take time to honor their senior class at Saturday night's game. From the first-ever NCAA Tournament berth in 2004 to a miserable five­win season the year after and right back up to a No. 1 ranking, CCHA. regular-season title and a guaranteed NCAA berth this year, the eight seniors -including jun­ior-year transfer Tom Sawatske -have seen the best and worst of Notre Dame hockey. 
"This class has got a lot of tal­ent and a lot of character," Jackson said. "I wouldn't dare compare them to any other class -they're different in their own right." · 

Ferris State is in ninth place in the league standings, hut the Bulldogs have a 5-1 record in February, including a 2-1 win Feb. 13 over No. 13 Michigan State. The Bulldogs are in the hunt for the last home playoff spot in the first round of the CCHA playoffs, trailing eighth­place Lake Superior State by three points. 
"I don't want anyone to think that we can afford to take these games lightly," Jackson said.

Notre Dame, Rutgers put streaks on the line 
I I 
By JAY FITZPATRICK Sports Writer 

Two teams riding winning streaks will collide Saturday in the Joyce Center as Notre Dame faces No. 21/22 Rutgers at noon. 
The Irish (19-8, 10-4 Big East) have won their last five games, including a 73-48 drubbing of Georgetown Wednesday night. The Scarlet Knights (18-7, 11-3 Big East) have been just as impressive of late, winning four in a row and nine of their last 10, falling only to No. 4 Connecticut 60-50 Feb. 6. 
The Irish have been strong at

home this season, beating three ranked teams already -No. 18 Bowling Green Nov. 13, No. 15 Purdue Dec. 6 and No. 23 Louisville Feb. 7. Despite the success Notre Dame has had in the Joyce Center, coach Muffet McGraw understands the chal­lenge Rutgers poses. 
"It's an important game for us because it's a chance for us to beat a ranked team," she said. "And the crowd's really helped us at home, hut it's going to be a really challenging game for us."

Prince and Carson lead a potent three-point attack for the Scarlet Knights, averaging .410 and .324 from beyond the arc, 
"Their guards are fast ­they're good three-point shoot­ers, which is probably their biggest improvement because we've always kind of packed in a zone against them," McGraw said.

Irish, MU battle for fourth seed 
By CHRIS KHOREY Associate Sports Editor 

Riding a three-game winning streak and looking to sew up a bye in the Big East tourna­ment, No. 23 Notre Dame will take on No. 16 Marquette at the Joyce Center Saturday. 
The Irish (21-6, 9-5 Big East) and Golden Eagles (22-7, lJ-5) are tied for fourth place in the conference and in the race for a bye in the tournament in New York that goes with it. 
Notre Dame can clinch a bye with a win and a Syracuse loss to Providence Saturday, while Marquette needs a win and two losses by the Orange to bypass the first round of the Big East tourney. 
"There's a lot on the line," Irish coach Mike Brey said. "I think our guys will be ready to play. Marquette and Notre Dame brings back a lot of memories." 
The Irish are also looking for their fourth straight victory after defeating Providence, Cincinnati and DePaul in a six­day stretch earlier this week. 
"We're going into the big game on Saturday feeling good about ourselves," junior for­ward Rob Kurz said. 
Notre Dame has a chance to finish 18-0 at the Joyce Center this season with a win Saturday. The Irish set the school record for home wins in a season with 17 in their win

Carter's perseverance makes him stand apart 

By CHRIS HINE Sports Writer 

Notre Dame guard Russell Carter walked out to meet the media for an interview before practice Feb. 1. He held a ball under his right arm and wiped his brow with his sweat­drenched practice jer­sey. Practice was still 30 minutes away, but someone for­got to tell that to Carter. 
"Yeah, I was just working out a little bit," he said. "Hard work gets us these wins. I'm not the only one sweating. As you can see, everyone's out there shooting." 
Sweating? Before practice? It makes sense given Carter's pedigree -his father, who had recently finished a 14-hour work day in his home state of New Jersey, was too tired to field questions about his S(}n over the telephone Wednesday. 
But Carter's sweat is not the only thing he has given to the Irish this season. 
Whether he holds three fin­gers in the air after draining a three or becomes angry after making a turnover, Carter is an emotional leader. His smile on the floor infects his teammates and brightens the Joyce Center. He loosens them, reminds them to have fun and elevates their play. His anger fires them up and adds a sense of urgency when things are not going so well. 
These characteristics are inherent to Carter's personali­ty. It's the way he's played 
since  he  was  a  child  in  
Paulsboro, N.J.  - a suburb of  
Philadelphia  - and it's the  

way he will continue to play once his career moves beyond South Bend. 
But the Jersey native and sociology major claimed that college has changed him as a person -even if what drives him remains intact. 
"Four years at a prestigious institution does nothing but change you." Carter said after Tuesday's 78-54 win against DePaul. "There's different types of people just interacting. There's a lot of people where I'm from you probably would never see, but to be able to interact with them, talk about anything is good. 

"It's good when people can put away their differences and just have a conversation." 
And most importantly. his work ethic has remained intact -and that's why he's been busy sweating, not only before practice

feared and admired players in the Big East. 
Before Notre Dame 
In high school, Carter over­came a knee injury caused by decaying bone marrow. But despite the injury, and the sub­sequent surgery, his mentality toward basketball remained the same. 
"It didn't affect [my attitude]. Injuries happen. You've got to play. Once you go on the court. there are no excuses," he said. "If you're going to acknowl­edge your weakness, you might as well not play." 
The injury took a while to heal and as a result, Carter was not highly recruited his senior year -despite averag­ing 30 points, 11.2 rebounds and 3.4 assists and leading his team to the state finals. 
"Just around the area, schools [recruited me] and that was basically it," Carter said. "During the middle and end of my senior season, Notre Dame came on board." 
Once the Irish called, Carter said the decision to enroll was simple. 
"The team was in the tourna­ment the previous three years and it's Notre Dame, the aca­demics speak for themselves," he said. "Good athletics. great academics, it was an easy deci­sion." 
Early years with the Irish 
During his freshman year, Carter played in only 11 games, averaging just 2.1 min­utes per contest. His sopho­more year, however, he saw more playing time (24 games, 
8.5 minutes per game) but felt he should be playing more. 
"I expected to play right away, but it didn't happen that way," Carter said.

feel comfortable talking to them, and to [former Irish assistant] coach [Lewis] Preston, who's no longer here, but it was mainly them that helped me through it." 
Still, through the tough times, Carter was determined to prove to Irish head coach Mike Brey that he could play. That same high school kid who fought through physical injury now had to overcome the men­tal frustration of not getting the playing time he thought he deserved. 
"I just went to practice and practiced hard and figured I'd continue working until I'd be able to play," he said. "I just felt if I got a chance to play I could show what I could do. It just motivated me to keep working." 
Getting his chance 
Carter earned that elusive spot in the starting lineup his junior year, starting in 28 of Notre Dame's 30 games, and averaging 13.3 points per con­test. But it's been his play this season -17 points per game on 41 percent shooting from 3­point range -that has gar­nered the attention of the national media, NBA scouts

and opposing defenses. 
When asked to summarize how he thinks the year is going, he framed his answer from a team perspective, not an individual one. 
"This year has gone how I predicted. No one gave us a lot of credit," he said. "At the beginning of the year we were picked eleventh. Now we have the ability to get a bye [in the first round of the Big East tournament]. I felt the Big East was a wide-open conference." 
But Carter has still had his share of adversity this year despite his statistics and Notre Dame's record. For the past few weeks, a right hip flexor has hampered Carter's quick­ness and effectiveness on both ends of the floor. 
"It's getting better," he said Tuesday. "I'm out there though, so I don't use it as an excuse." 
Carter still averages 17 points per game, which ties him with Villanova forward Curtis Sumpter for second in the conference. Besides his offensive improvement throughout the past four years, Carter has worked equally as hard on his defense -some­thing for which he feels he deserves more credit. 
"I don't know if they notice my defense. When people score a lot of points, their defense is overlooked. If people pay attention they can see I'm a good defender," he said with a big grin on his face. "Not only certain plays, like a steal and dunk, there's a lot of little plays that go unnoticed. 
"That's always going to hap­pen. Offense in basketball is more notable than defense. I don't take it as offense, but if you try to score on me then I guess you'll find out." 
Looking ahead 
For Carter, playing in the NBA could not be farther from his mind at this point despite his noticible athleticism and rare, given his age and experi­the NCAA Tournament. 

"It would mean everything. I've never been there," he said. "Colin [Falls] has never been there. No one on this team has been there. To get there, just speaks volumes about our sen­ior class. We kept it moving." 
Carter's journey has been filled with his fair share of obstacles, molding his person­ality in the process. 
But some of his traits will never change, namely, his sense of humor and straight­forward attitude. 
A few years ago, when his dorm mates in Fisher Hall were designing a shirt in honor of Carter, they asked him for a quote. The first attempt that did not make the cut read, "If I was three inches taller, I'd be playing for the Clippers right now." 
Today, while he speaks with a polished demeanor beyond his years, the humorous kid still shines through when reflecting on that time. 
"I was just being stupid because I always thought I'd grow up to be 6-foot-6 like [Michael] Jordan," he said. ''I'm like 6-foot-4, 6-foot-3 and a half, so if I had a couple of more inches -I'd be amaz­ing." 
Whether Carter will one day be "amazing" in the NBA, only time will tell. If his basketball career fails to pan out, two things are for sure. 
One, only circumstances beyond his control will prevent him from playing in the NBA. It will have nothing to do with hard work and dedication. And two, regardless of what hap­pens, he won't make any excuses. 
"When I'm on the court, there's really nothing to fear," he said. "I mean, you're a guy just like me, you put on your pants just the same way I do. If I knock you down hard enough you're going to bleed. Unless there are immortals out there, I have nothing to fear."
