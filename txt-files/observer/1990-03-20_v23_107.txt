INSIDE COLUMN 

Editor's job the 
stuff dreams 

are made of 
Last night former Observer editors came to me in a drnam. "Alison." they said, looking sorrowfully at me, "the AP wire is down, the band building is missing Alison Cocks and security refuses Editor-in-Chief 
to confirm whether 
an investigation of --------­the incident is being launched, the typesetter won't typeset and all the locks have been changed on the office doors." 
So what's the problem? 
"Now you have to handle everything. And put out a 16-page forum for student thought with objective news coverage, thought-provoking Viewpoint pieces, enter­taining features and the sports coverage ev­eryone loves by tomorrow morning." 

Great. Is that all? 
"No. You also have to oversee the sale of ads to offset costs, make sure the Classi­lieds program is functioning, kick the com­puters when there are system errors and field calls from irate officers of the "Abortion Rights for Wives of Oppressed Aborigines Coalition." 
Do I get any help? 
"Remember the competent staff you hired before Spring Break? They'll put their con­siderable talents to work to help you main­tain your sanity. Don't forget, if it weren't for them you'd be laying out the paper by yourself until 5 a.m." 
True. So I have to act calmly and ra­tionally, maintain my cheerful disposition through every disaster, keep the staff happy and motivated and continue to improve the end product. Anything else? 
"Don't forget the most important people of all." Who? The administration? The alumni? My family? 
"The readers. Primarily the students at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. The easiest thing for them to do is to put down The Ob­server and discuss the state of the salad bar. Your job is to make them want to keep reading about events on both campuses." 
Any suggestions'! 
"You can start by being receptive to the input of the public. If they pick up the paper and read it with inquisitive, open minds they are qualified to eomment. Even if they don't realize what goes into producing a daily newspaper doesn't mean their criticisms aren't somewhat valid. You can't please ev­eryone, but you can at least try to satisfy the majority of them." 
(Sigh) I suppose I also have to take classes, eat meals, sleep and call home once in awhile? 
"That would be nice." 
Is that all or can I do anything else? 
"We could use someone to jump over the 
moon." 
No, thanks, I'll stick with the task at hand 
for now.

Assailants strolled into an ice cream parlor in a northwestern Colombian town yesterday and sprayed it with gunfire, killing six people and wounding four, police said Monday. Authorities were trying to determine the identities of the gunmen and the motive for the shooting late Sunday in Apartado, 280 miles north of Bogota, a police statement said. It said most victims were workers on the banana plantations that cover the Uraba region on the border with Panama. 
The British government said Monday it is setting up a special war crimes unit of police officers to investigate alleged World War II atrocities committed by people now living in England. Home Secretary David Waddington said the Bri'tish police had never investigated war crimes before and the unit would work in the same way the police investigated "any other criminal activi­ties." lie said police, legal authorities and the courts would have the responsibility for prosecutions, trials and convictions and the government would not interfere. 
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa of Syria met with President Hashemi Hafsanjani of Iran on Mon­day and Hafsanjani stressed Iran's support for Syria in its confrontation with Israel, Tehran radio said. Sharaa emphasized the close relations between Syria and Iran. Iran's official Islamic Hepublic News Agency said Sharaa discussed Palestine, Lebanon and other subjects with Ira­nian officials during his visit to Iran. But it did not men­tion the issue of Western hostages in Lebanon.

Walter Mack, who rescued a largely unknown Pepsi-Cola Co. during the Depression and turned it into the country's No. 2 soft drink maker, died Sunday after a lengthy illness at age 94. Mack ran unsuccessfully for the New York state Senate in 1932 and worked on Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia's mayoral 

campaigns. He also served as chairman of the New York County Republican Committee. It was while trying to save the New York-based Loft's candy chain that he took a special interest in its Pepsi syrup di­vision. Pepsi was spun off and Mack became its president 
The FBI searched around the world Monday for a dozen priceless artworks stolen from Boston's Gardner Museum. Authorities said it was the biggest theft of mod­ern times-a $100 million-plus caper exceeded only by the looting of Germany's national bank at the end of World War II. The museum, meanwhile, disclosed that the missing works were insured for damage as well as restoration and conservation, but that it had no theft in­
surance.

Some union members and state em­ployees have decided to support a state prison guard boycott of the Indiana Lottery. "We know that's not going to break the lottery," said Hoger Cooper, president of a chapter of the Indiana State Employees Association at the Michigan City prison. "It's simply going to emphasize how that money could be used to help state employees." 
Terre Haute's mayor has called foul about resident complaints that the town has a less than pleasant odor. "My reaction to any citi­zen calling this the stink capital of the world is that there is a bus leaving today," said mayor Pete Chalos.

NASA pilot will lecture Wed. 
Special to The Observer 
Commander James Wether­bee. Notre Dame's first gradu­ate in space, will present a Dis­tinguished Alumni Lecture Wednesday, March 21 at 3:30 
p.m. in Washington Hall. 
Wetherbee will show slides 
and a 20-minute NASA film and 
also answer questions from the 
audience. 
Wetherbee received his bache­
lor's degree in aerospace engi­
neering in 197 4. He served as 
pilot on the crew of STS-32, 
which was launched from the 
Kennedy Space Center in Cape 
Canaveral, Fla., on Jan. 9, 
1990. 
In the longest Shuttle mission to date, crew members aboard the Orbiter Columbia success­fully deployed the Syncom IV­FS satellite and retrieved the 21,400 pound Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) using NASA's remote manipulator system. The LDEF, a large 12­sided trunk that had been sus­pended in space for more than five years, contained 56 exper­iments sponsored by scientists of many nationalities. 
A number of medical tests were conducted as well -in­cluding inflight lower body negative pressure and infiight aerobic exercise and muscle performance -to evaluate human adaptation to extended duration missions. 
After 173 orbits of the earth in 261 hours, Columbia re­turned Jan. 20 with a night 
landing at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. 
Commissioned in the U.S. Navy in 1975, Commander Wetherbee was designated a naval aviator in 1976. In 1981 he trained in the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School in Patuxent River, Md. 
He was selected in 1 984 by NASA as an astronaut candi­date, qualifying him for as­signment as a pilot on future space shuttle flight crews. 
The lecture is free and open to the public. However. no tick­ets will be issued and seating is on a first come-first served ba­sis.

Morgan would not allow news media near her daughter fol­lowing the weekend reunion and pledged Monday to dodge the media as she continues her light for custody. 
Hilary's hiding place became the focus of world attention when her father found her here three weeks ago. 
The New Zealand Family Court is to rule on the custody issue and has barred reporters from covering the proceedings. No date has been publicly an­nounced for the hearing. Fore­tich and Morgan now are di­vorced. 
Morgan refused to speak to the media Monday or let herself be photographed with her daughter. 
She would not say how long she expects to stay in Christchurch and had no com­ment to all other questions. She drove her daughter the 200 yards from the Diplomat Motel to Selwyn Ilouse school Monday 
after being alerted that pho­
tographers were waiting out­
side. 
She took a back route to the 
school Monday afternoon to 
whisk Hilary home. 
Heporters have been ordered 
not to enter the grounds of the 
Diplomat Hotel, Hilary's home 
since mid-1988 
Also Monday, Morgan met her husband, U.S. Court of Ap­peals Judge Paul Michel, at Christchurch Airport. Michel told The Associated Press he arrived in Auckland on Sunday and spent the day talking to his wife's lawyer, Lyn Stevens, and her senior U.S. lawyer Stephen Sachs. 
Michel said he will stay in Christchurch for one week be­fore returning to Washington. 
He said he saw a "good deal of Hilary for nearly a year be­fore she went in hiding." 
But by late Monday he still had not seen the child at the center of the bitter custody bat­tle.

"This case stinks to high heaven," Kelly said during a hearing on a lawsuit over the loss of the twin-engine Beech King Air, which was ditched in the Caribbean Sea on Jan. 3, 1983. 
The pilot, convicted smuggler Michael Toliver, later testified that he flew arms to Nicaragua's Contra rebels and illegal drugs back to the United States several times under the supervision of federal agents. 
Kelly had canceled a trial set 
for January after being told in 
November that the case had 
been settled through mediation. 
But on Friday, Richard Mon­
tague, an assistant U.S. attor­
ney general from Washington, 
told Kelly that Justice Depart­
ment officials never approved 
the settlement, and said the 
case should go to trial. 
Kelley ordered Thornburgh to appear at an April 2 hearing in Wichita to straighten out the lawsuit's status. 
Thornburgh aide Michael Robinson said Monday that the attorney general had not yet decided how to respond to the order. 
Kelly told Montague that the case "involves the transport of drugs by agents of the United States or with the acquiescence of the United States." Mon­tague objected, saying that To­liver was the only witness mak­ing such statements and that his credibility was questionable. The attorney said the insurance case had nothing to do with those statements. 
Kelly said he was frustrated by the government's lack of ac­tion in response to Toliver's disclosures. 
"I have heard nothing," the judge said. "Frankly, what I have had is stonewalling at the hands of the United States and I'm not going to have any more." 
Kelly had been so alarmed by Toliver's statements that he ordered transcripts of the tes­timony delivered to the FBI, CIA and to then-President Reagan at Bethesda Naval Hospital. 
"The president of the United States advised me in spades that the attorney general was fully familiar with it, and I don't think you are," Kelly told Montague, who was represent­ing the Justice Department. 
Montague said the question of whether a criminal investiga­tion was warranted was up to the attorney general, not the judge. 
Toliver testified in Kelly's court in 1987 that he made two trips to Honduras and Colom­bia the previous year with arms for the Contras and returned to the United States with loads of cocaine and marijuana. 
He said he landed at Home­stead Air Force Base, Fla., with one drug load and that he worked as an informant and contract employee under fed­eral supervision. 
Toliver testified that he wasn't working for the gov­ernment when he crashed the plane. He said he had discon­nected a U.S. Customs Service homing device aboard the plane, and took off in another direction with a load of mari­juana. He ditched the craft off Grand Cayman Island when he ran out of fuel trying to avoid storms. 
Toliver, who is serving a mar­ijuana smuggling sentence in North Carolina, was granted immunity in exchange for his testimony. 
The lawsuit was filed by Mid­land National Bank of Newton, which said it had a $198,000 lien on the plane.

Jury acquits Aguilar on one count, declares mistrial on seven others 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -A jury acquitted U.S. District Judgn Hobert Aguilar of an ob­struction-of-justice charge Monday but deadlocked on seven other felony counts. A prosecutor said Aguilar would be retried on those charges. 
Aguilar was acquitted of a charge that he improperly ap­proached another federal judge, Samuel Conti, to seek fa­vorable treatment for a friend and creditor, Ronald Cloud, in a pending bank fraud trial. 
The jury reported that it was unable to reach a verdict on the other charges after seven days of deliberations. U.S. District Judge Louis Bechtle declared a mistrial and scheduled proceed­ings on a possible retrial for June 4. 
"It is the government's pre­sent intention to retry all of the counts on which the jury was unable to reach a verdict," Justice Department prosecutor William Keefer told reporters. 
Aguilar did not change ex­pression when the jury's verdict was read, but puffed his cheeks as if to release tension. He de­clined to comment afterward.

Judge denies Contra mistrial 
WASHINGTON (AP)-A fed­mal judge on Monday denied a mistrial motion by John Poindexter that was triggered by a reference in open court to testimony Poindexter had given Congress under a grant of im­munity. 
The information in the refer­ence was "not new at all," said the judge in Poindexter's Iran­Contra trial. 
With Rep. Lee Hamilton on the witness stand. prosecutor Dan Webb asked about a doe­unwnt, signed by then-President Heagan, indicating missil11s had been sent to Iran in 1985 to try to win the release of Americans held in Lnbanon. 
I lad Poindext11r Pver n~ported dP.stroying tlw document? Webb asked. 
"lie did," Ilamilton said in front of thn jury. 
In othnr tnstimony, Ilamilton said the late CIA Director William Casey denied the very existnnce of the document in congressional testimony -a dnnial that was not true and a denial that had not bt~en known bt~forn. 
Thn congressman, co-chair­man of a special congressional committee that investigatnd the Iran-Contra affair, was refer­ring to Poindexter's July 1987 testimony to the committee, during which he said he tore up thn document. 
No part of the ease against Beagan's national security ad­viser may be derived from his testimony to Congress. given under a grant of immunity from prosecution. 
As soon as Hamilton an­swered the question on Mon­day. another prosecutor. Howard Pearl, stood up and Webb quickly said "I see the problem." 
Webb rephrased the question, but Poindexter lawyer Richard Heckler later asked for a mis­trial, saying that Hamilton had specifically been instructed not to refer to Poindexter's immu­nized testimony. 
U.S. District Judge Harold Greene denied the motion, say­ing that Oliver North testified last week that he watched Poindexter tear up the finding. 
Grmme said Hamilton's testi­mony was "cumulative rather than harmful." 
Beckler suggested the jury might not find North's testi­mony credible. Hut Greene also noted that "both the govern­mont and the defense referred to tearing up of the finding" in their opening statements to the jury. 
"And you have great credibil­ity," Greene told Beckler. 
The information about tear­ing up the finding "is not new at all," Greene concluded. 
In November 1986, Hamilton had been chairman of the House Intelligence Committee that met with Poindexter to discuss U.S. arms sales to Iran. 
The congressman said the na­tional security adviser made no mention of a U.S. role in the November 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran. The CIA­
assisted delivery was autho­
rized by the Reagan "finding" 
that Poindexter destroyed 
hours after testifying before 
the committee. 
Casey, who prepared the 

finding for Reagan, appeared 
with Poindexter before the 
committee. 
"Do you remember Casey in 

that testimony actually telling 
you there was no finding for 
that 1985 shipment" of Hawk 
missiles to Iran? Webb asked 
Hamilton. 
"I do," replied Hamilton. 

Wnbb asked Hamilton, "Do you recall whether Admiral Poindexter said he could reveal 
all the facts?" 
"Admiral Poindexter said ... President Beagan wanted to tell the full story," replied Hamil­ton. 
The finding that Poindexter destroyed depicted the U.S. role in Iran arms sales as a straight arms-for-hostages deal, the kind of arrangement the Bea­gan administration declared it would never allow. 
Poindexter told the Intelli­gence Committee members that the U.S. government didn't learn until January 1986 of the missile shipment. according to notes taken at the meeting by a congressional staffer. 
Hamilton said Poindexter read verbatim a January 1986 presidential finding that did not 
portray the Iran initiative as a straight trade of arms for hostages. 
Violence delays Greyhound talks 

DALLAS (AP) -Greyhound 
said Monday it will not resume 
stalled talks with striking 
drivers until attacks on buses 
and rnp1acement drivers stop, 
but a union leader pledged to 
nwet "any time" with company 
negotiators. 
The first meeting between tlw 
two sides broke down Sunday 
wlwn Dallas-based Greyhound 
aeeusnd union leaders of failing 
to nngotiate and of stepping up 
violnnee in the walkout. now in 
its third week. 
"i\ lot of the problem was the 
continuing intimidation and vi­
olence," said company 
spokeswoman Lyn Graylny. 
"The company just does not 
feel that they will be intimi­
dated into (accepting) a con­
tract." 
"Maybe if the violence and 
terrorism and intimidation and 
all that stopped ... (reopening 
talks) would be considered," 
she said. "Our main concern at 
this point is the safety of our 
passengers and employees." 
There have been at least 14 
shooting attacks on Greyhound 
buses, 46 bomb threats and 
numerous other incidents of 
vandalism or threats during the 
18-day-old walkout, company 
oflieials say. 
Greyhound operates the only 
nationwide intercity bus service, 
and thn strike has stranded 
many smaller communities for 
which husns arc the only public 
transportation. 
Unions mprnsenting 6,:H>O 
drivnrs and an estimated 3,000 
otlwr (~reyhound workers 
walknd out March 2 ovnr 
wages, job security and 
grinvancn procedures. 
In I>nnvnr. thn Arnalgamatnd Transit Union's vice pmsidnnt. .lim Ilayes, said tlw union would n~turn to talks "any time, any place,'' but the stick­ing point is Greyhound's unwill­ingness to compromise. 
"The company hasn't rhangnd a thing," hn said. "The company makes on11 cent per mile for twery passenger and that eornt~s out to about $78 million. We're asking for $40 million over 3 years." 
The bus company last week began a nationwide radio ad­vertising campaign to counter allegations by striking drivers that newly hired drivers were not properly trained. 
"We'vp, hired many new per­manent drivers who are profes­sionally qualified, thoroughly trainnd and committed to giving you the quality service you've come to expect from Grey­hound," the radio spots say. 
Grayley, the company spokeswoman, said the new drivers must have two years experience driving a bus or truck, and are certified by the Department of Transportation. 
"With so many of the violent episodes that have gone on, people are nervous," she said. "And we don't want them to feel that's going to happen ev­ery time a bus goes out on the road. We want them to know we're doing everything in our power to make those buses safe," she said. 
Union leaders say they con­demned the violtmee and Grey­
hound is the one balking in ne­
gotiations. 
"We have continually called 
for our members to refrain 
from illegal activity," said Jeff 
Nelson, spokesman for the 
Amalgamated Council of Grey­
hound Local Unions in Wash­
ington. "But. we are not po­
lice." 
"This is simply an attempt by 
the company's so-called nego­
tiator to stonewall the real is­
sue, which is negotiating a con­
tract," Nelson said. 
During talks in Tucson, Ariz. on Saturday, the union pro­posed a $40 million three-year package that included pay in­creases of 4 percent to 5 per­cent and the addition of new drivers to the pension plan. 
But the cost would be "three 
times more than Greyhound 
could afford." Grayley said. 
A union spokesman said the company has offered a plan that included no guaranteed pay raises, but would have made raises contingent on in­creased profits and ridership.

Hazlewood loses battle over a word 
ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) ­Joseph Hazelwood's defense lost a legal battle Monday over a single word that could affect how jurors decide whether the Exxon Valdez skipper was drunk when his ship went aground. 
The word was "noticeably," and was contained in a legal in­struction that told jurors to de­cide whether Hazelwood was "noticeably impaired" on the night of the nation's largest oil spill. 
Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone removed the word and said he would tell jurors they must only decide whether Hazelwood was impaired. 
"There are a lot of people who can mask their impair­ment," he told lawyers in ex­plaining his decision. 
Defense lawyer Dick Madson appeared stunned by the ruling, saying, "This is the first time I've ever h~ard of this." 
Madson said in his years of defending drunken driving cases in Fairbanks, the term "noticeably impaired" always has been included in jury in­structions. 
"My gosh, it's been around for a long time," he told the judge. 
But Assistant District Attor­
ney Sam Adams argued, "All we 
have to prove is that he was 
impaired, not stumble-down 
drunk." 
Hazelwood is charged with 
one felony, criminal mischief, 
and three misdemeanors, reck­
less endangerment, operating a 
vessel while intoxicated and 
negligent discharge of oil. 
His tanker ran aground on Bligh Reef last March 24, spilling nearly 11 million gal­lons of Alaska North Slope crude oil, wreaking devastation over hundreds of miles of shoreline rich with fish, birds and other wildlife. 
The question of whether Hazelwood showed signs of in­toxication has been a key ele­ment in his trial, with numerous witnesses testifying that the skipper did not stagger, slur his words or show any other evidence that he was drunk. Three witnesses said they smelled alcohol on his breath. 
The judge's ruling came dur­ing a discussion of legal in­structions which will be given to jurors after attorneys deliver their final arguments Tuesday. 
In other rulings, the judge said he would "take judicial no­tice" of the fact the U.S. Coast Guard had a regulation barring tanker crews from drinking al­cohol less than four hours be­fore sailing. But he refus.ed to give an instruction on the point, because the regulation is not state law. 
He also refused a proposed prosecution instruction that would have told jurors the Coast Guard's blood alcohol limit for operating a commer­cial vessel is .04, well below the state level of .10 for drunken driving. Hazelwood's blood al­cohol level was below the state limit, but violated the Coast Guard's. 
Hots off to you Cora!

LA BAlE, Quebec (AP) -An explosion on a container ship loading aluminum at a wharf in this Quebec town Monday killed two people and injured at least seven, police and company sources said. 
Sgt. Maurice Girard of La Baie police said the afternoon blast rocked the town along the Saguenay River about 120 miles north of Quebec City. Some res­idents thought there had been an earthquake. 
Alcan Aluminium runs the wharf, which is used to service its local smelter. 
Alcan employee Fernard Le­clerc said the two killed were members of the crew of the Pollux, a Norwegian ship. 
He said they were loading containers into the ship's hold, where the explosion occurred. Leclerc said seven Alcan em­ployees were injured. 
He said he could only specu­late about the cause of the ex­plosion. He said the material in the containers -spent linings from the smelting process of aluminum-"can, under cer­tain conditions and if not prop­erly handled, produce toxic gases, including methane." 
Girard said the ship wasn't seriously damaged.

Census of the homeless masks the casualties of Reaganomics 
Dear Hdilor: 
The war on poverty is almost over. Now it is time to do a body eount of the casualties. The weapons Wf\rll the trickle down theory, union busting, elimination of insurance and other benefits. The full-time llmployee is rapidly becoming an endangered spneies. Yes, the war is almost over, and gov­ernnwnt, by joining forces with business, has widened the gap between the rich and the poor. amounting to a privileged vie­tory. 
Today, there will be a "token" body count (census) of the homeless. Unlike Vietnam, the count must be undPrstated, so the brutality of "Heaganomies" can be masked into a "kinder, gentler nation." By careful orchestration, the count can be made to appear that only the dredges of society, the fringes of lower. but human life forms, were affected. 
Fortunately for the nation's 
budget, most of the vanquished
have chosen a cloak of invisibil­ity, not wanting to be identified with the stigma of being home­less. They accomplish this by avoiding shelters. In Chicago for instanc11, if understating the body count by 1,000 homeless, the government can save over $4,000,000 in the 1990s.This is done by diminishing the popula­tion's federal funding by $400 per person per annum. Therefore, it is expedient for the government to not count as many homeless by as much as the vocal minority will accept. 
Logically the homeless are surviving without benefit of in-

esc puts politics before religion 
Dear Hdilor: 
We believe that the Center for Soda! Coneerns. through the composition of many of its groups, and their leaders, is oriented toward a particular political persuasion, with a secondary emphasis on the possibility of living one's faith. 
Wednesday night, Feb. 28, a number of salient facts about the nature of the esc as per­eeived by a number of represen­tative individuals were illus­trated at a meeting of group leaders. Some of these illumina­tions were very interesting. It became apparent at the meeting that the image of the Center, held by many students who have not had much direct eontact with it, may not be far ofT base. 
The Center serves as a home for many organizations that do an incredible amount of won­derful works in both the South 
Bend an1a, as well as on the campus. The problem that arose that evening was that the Center, or at least the groups present, place the least possible emphasis on doing such works as a statement of one's faith. In fact, many were afraid of be­coming exclusive by alienating those who do not believe in God or the teachings of the Gospels. The question was raised as to whether there should be, or why there needs to be, religion present at the CSC. From what we gathered, that answer was a resounding "no," except on an individual basis. We believe, however, that the mission of the Center for Social Concerns would be more fully accom­plished by emphasizing the faith in dealing with issues of peace and social justice. 
Lent is a time of introspec­tion. We would like people to ponder whether justice or peace 
issues are separate from reli­gion, or whether they coexist. As well, should the CSC foster such a union, and is it at present working at all in that direction? It is a shame that at this meeting of group leaders it was more important to respect someone's unbelief than to fos­ter the belief of God in others­espPcially at a religiously affili­ated university. The CSC could be a wonderful place for young people to live out their faith, rather than their politics. If people realize as they work through their faith that politics plays a role, then that is fine, and perhaps inevitable. But to expect religion to be an appendage of politics denies the importance of God.

Styrofoam products used at ND damage the ozone layer 
Dear Editor: 
Congratulations to the Environmental Action Club and to the Student Senate for pass­ing a resolution calling for the phased elimination. of styrofoam from our campus. It is extremely encouraging to see even a small part of the Notre Dame administration endorsing responsible environmental principles. 
The production of styrofoam cups, containers, and other goods is a major cause of the depletion of the ozone layer of our atmosphere. The Huddle, the Oak Hoom, and most other food oriented services on cam­pus all use styrofoam cups to serve items like coffee, hot chocolate and hot tea. 
The purchase, as well as the production of styrofoam, is environmentally immoral and. 
unlike the controversy over di­vestment from South Africa, the elimination of investment in styrofoam products has no immoral side consequences. Switching from styrofoam to other substitute, recyeleable products would only affeet the managenHmt of these busi­nesses and possibly, increase the cost of a cup of coffee or cocoa. 
I'm anxiously awaiting University Food Servie«~'s posi­tivn response to this resolution. I encourage all students to look ahead to Earth Day, April 22. 1990 where they can get in­volved and makn an Pnviron­mental difference on our own campus. Who says you can't change the world?

Critics inaccurately understand ads regarding the homosexuality issue 
Dear Editor: 
John Warren, in his letter to the editor (The Observer, March 8), has completely mis­read advertisements on homo­sexuality recently appearing in The Observer. The ads did not invite the reader to "feel the same about ballroom dancing, golf, bowling, hunting, jogging and homosexuality." His claim to the contrary is both careless and silly. The ads point out that statistical infrequency (1 0 per­cent or less) is a suspect indica­tor of "abnormality." Later ads in the series challenge common stereotypes about differences in the social values of homosexu­als and heterosexuals. 
If when dealing with the sub­ject of homosexuality, Warren cannot read a simple adver­tisement and get it right, what confidence can we have in his related opinions on sin and re­demption, or such lesser topics as the role of genes in the de­velopment of complex social behaviors, the relevance of an­imal models, or the profes­sional integrity of the proceed­ings of the American Psychi­atric Association? Do the poli­cies of Campus Ministry on this topic have a cogent advocate?

Taking each day as it comes 
Sophomore Marty Sprunck returns to NO after a draining battle with cancer 
CINDY PETRITES 
accent writer 
H 
n had dncided to call his project, "A Day in the Life of a Domer." And it 
was to complete 

it that one sunny day in April of last year, that fn~shman Marty Sprunck left his room in Flanner, grabbed his jambox, hopped on his bikn, and rode over to the Peace Memorial Fountain: the perfect place to observe typical Domnrs on a typical spring day. Whml he arrived at the fountain. Marty was out of bn~ath. LatPr that day as he climbed thn stnps of thn Administration Building to intnrvinw "Monk" Malloy, he was so windPd that he had to stop. I low strange, hn thought. Probably all!rgics. Later that wnnk after feeling short of breath whiln rheekmarking eourses. Marty went to the In­firmary to cheek it out. 
Aftnr two hours in th!~ waiting room. the doetor ealled Marty in. But without nven hearing a professional's explanation, Marty could sen for himself that sonwthing was tPrribly wrong. "It looknd like part of my right lung was missing," reealls Marty. AftPr draining tlw 11uid on his lung-the initial problPm-Marty wnnt to St. Josnph 's Hospital for tests. A few days later lw discovered that lw had non-Hodgkins lymphoma. and a tumor the siw of a largn orange in his chest. 
700 miles away in Moundsvinw. Minnesota, Julian and Mildred Sprunek, Marty's parPnts, wPrt' slt>Pping whnn tlw phmw rang. It was Marty making his rPgular hiwnekly rail. But tlw news this time was not n~gular: this timP Marty's panmts lnanwd that their only son had bePn diagnosed with eaneer. 
"J don't know how I fune­
tionnd," Julian Sprunck told 
their loeal Minnnsota paper, 
describing that 11-hour drive to 
Notrn Dame. "You reel, literally 
reel from shock. disbelief, 
denial. bnwilderment, con­
fusion, anger, and helplessness 
at the fact that. .. cancer has 
struck your son." 
After returning to Minnesota, Marty spent four weeks at St. Mary's Hospital, part of the Hiverside Medical Center in Minneapolis, undergoing chemotherapy for Non­llodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer which strikes the lymph nodes and eirculatns throughout the blood. But after those grueling four Wll!)ks. on May 29, Marty's X-ray showed, miraculously, that the tumor was gone. Thus, Marty, though 20 pounds lighter, weak, and almost completely bald, was overjoyed. lie was cured, or so he thought. 
At the end of June, Marty's doctors suggested the possibil­ity of a bone-marrow trans­plant. a procedure in which the patient's own malfunctioning bone marrow is first "knocked out" by massive doses of chemotherapy and radiation. 

Then, either marrow from a healthy donor, or in Marty's case from the patient himself, is transfused in hope that it will take over and resume the func­tion of producing blood cells. 
Though the process is long and painful-"of those two weeks, I remember about five minutes, I was so doped up," Marty says-without it Marty's doctors suggested that the odds ran between 75 and 80 percent that the cancer would return. In addition, without the transplant he could look for­ward to chemotherapy every month, long hospital stays, and giving himself injections. With the treatment, his chances for total long-term remission could increase up to 80 percent. 
Marty chose the transplant. 
following a week-long bat­tery of tests at the Masonic Cancer Center in Minnesota, Marty underwent the bone marrow harvest on August 7, a process Marty remembers as "pretty painful." Two massive doses of chemotherapy, a day off, and four days of radiation then readied Marty for the bone marrow reinfusion on August 17. 
Marty has very little memory of those two weeks. "I remem­ber having to sit in the radia­tion room like this," -Marty hugs his knees to his chest-"and they taped me up so I wouldn't move." He smiles. "This caused a big problem when I had to go to the bath­room." 
Ten days later, the fateful news came. On August 27 Marty had a white blood cell count, a sign indicating that the marrow transplant was suc­cessful. "I was even ahead of schedule," Marty says. "They normally don't expect a white blood cell count for three weeks." 
Then began what Marty de­scribed as "the long waiting game." Bone marrow trans­plant patients can only go home after maintaining a steady blood count of at least 2000 for three consecutive days. But for two weeks the cycle remained: Friday, 2000. Saturday, 2000. Sunday, 2000. Marty was frus­trated. Sitting in his hospital room, its walls plastered with U2 posters, balloons, cards, and pictures of friends, he was eager to go home. Finally, after two more weeks in the hospital, making it a total of 35 days, the doctors gave Marty the go­ahead. 
But going home didn't just mean sleeping in his own bed and staying up late. It also meant solid food. The first thing Marty ate: a hot dog with mustard and ketchup. "Every time I go to a Twins game, I have to get a hot dog with mus­tard and ketchup. But that hot dog was the best I ever had. Even if I did only get to eat half of it," says Marty. 
Having returned in January to the life he left nine months ago as an aerospace engineer­ing freshman, Marty (now a first semester sophomore) is readjusting to life as a Domer. While once he waited for his white blood count to rise, now, bringing up his grades in a few classes and finding a date to Sophomore Formal are among his biggest concerns. And though he will have to wait on getting involved in extra-cur­riculars-he played the role of the priest in last year's Notre Dame production of "Twelfth Night"-he admits that what he enjoys about Notre Dame is "just being here." 
Has the experience changed Marty? "Not really," he says. "People ask me, 'Did you ever think you'd die?' But I never did. Having that attitude really made a big difference, I think. Now, I don't plan ahead as much as I used to. I just take every day as it comes." 
Marty feels that, for the most part, the disease is behind him, though he does have constant reminders. He must have a check-up every six months to monitor his progress. He says, "Every now and then I think it (the cancer) is something I have overcome. Then I look in the mirror and see, well, it's still there." 
Losing his hair has been an experience in itself for Marty. "People ask me, 'Wasn't it hor­rifying to lose your hair?' I think it's kind of funny," he says. Take one time when Marty was shopping in down­town Minneapolis, and a man mistook him for a Nazi skin­head. The man, a passenger in a car, started hurling obsceni­ties and was on the verge of getting out of the car to attack Marty when, luckily, the driver sped away. "He would have gone at it with me right there," Marty recalls. 
Marty's black French para­trooper beret and fluorescent green smiley-face button have become somewhat of a signa­ture for Marty, who is a familiar face about North Quad. He feels that the smiley-face with moving googley eyes is a sym­bol which captures him to a tee, as it reflects the positive atti­tude which has, with the sup­port of many friends here at Notre Dame, pulled him through many tough moments. And what has been the tough­est? 
"The hardest part of the whole experience was leaving this place," says Marty. "Ire­member leaving Notre Dame last April, just when the flowers were starting to bloom and ev­erything was green. When we got to the end of the road by the main entrance my Dad stopped and pointed to the statue of Mary atop the Dome. 'You bring our son back here,' he said. And she did."

As the offense was hitting easy lay-ups, the Cavalier de­fense was holding the Irish scoreless for five minutes. With two minutes to go the Cavs were up 63-50. 
"Coach said they never give up at crunch time," Irish guard Elmer Bennett said. "They shut the door on us." 
'The key was the fact that we put points on the board when they were starting to find a rhythm," Virginia coach Terry Holland said. 
Bennett was the target of Virginia's diamond-and-one de­fense early in the contest. He still man~rul eight poi11ts in the first half but the rest of the offense combined scored only 10. 
"We wanted to play the dia­mond to slow them up," Holland said. "We knew we'd go back to man-to-man later. Notre Dame exploited it for a while." 
"We came out hard and looked to attack," Virginia's John Crotty said. "The diamond took the zip out of their of­fense. It seemed like they'd never faced that before and it confused them. It was effective for us." 
Crotty led both teams with 28 points and orchestrated the Virginia offense, setting a slow tempo that worked because Virginia hit its shots and domi­nated on the boards. 
Bennett led Notre Dame with 17 points, while Daimon Sweet added 14.

Dickerson says it's time to retire 
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -Eric Dickerson, the seventh-leading rusher in NFL history, says he will not be back with the Indianapolis Colts next season and intends to retire. 
''I'm through with football, and (the Colts) know it. So I'm telling you, I'm finished," Dickerson, 29, said in an inter­view broadcast Monday on on WFYI-TV's "Indiana Tonight" show. 
.lim Irsay, the Colts' general manager and son of owner Hobert lrsay, said through a spokesman on Monday that the team expected Dickerson to ful­lill his contract obligations. 
"We don't make it a point to discuss our players' contracts," spokesman Craig Kelley said of Dickerson's obligations. 
Dickerson has said his con­tract expires after the 1990 season. 
Irsay called Dickerson's statements "a slap in the face." 
''Before we made the trade with the Rams to obtain Eric, he gave us his assurances he would play out his contract," he said. "We are tremendously disappointed by his actions." 
During the 20-minute inter­view, taped last Thursday at his Los Angeles home, Dickerson, who h'as spent 2 1/2 seasons with the Colts, said he has lost interest in playing football. 
"Hight now I really don't love the game that much," he said. "I don't love it like I did at one time. But rather than stay in Indianapolis and take the pounding that I'm taking, I'd 
rather quit. 
"I mean, it's like taking a re­volver and putting a bullet in it and spinning it around and sticking it to my head, and 
·sooner or later a bullet is gonna come out and kill me. And that's the chance I'm tak­ing," he said. 
"I just can't do that. I like my health. I'll take my health, and no amount of money in the world can buy my health." 
Dickerson has gained 11,226 yards, 10 behind O.J. Simpson, and has rushed for more than 1,000 yards in each of his seven NFL seasons. He holds the sin­gle-season record of 2,105 yards, set with the Los Angeles Rams in 1984, one year after he set the rookie record with 1,808 yards.

Lacrosse gets battered by brawny opponents over break

The lacrosse team, shown here in indoor action vs. Radford, suffered a winless spring break, losing to Villanova, Loyola and Adelphi.

Dame defense, already exhausted by the onslaught it had suffered at Villanova. 
As in the match against Villanova, the silver lining in the douds for the Irish were Brian McHugh and Dave Carey. McHugh, with one goal tallied, showed why he is steadily climbing the Notre Dame lacrosse all-time scoring list, and Carey again chipped in a lone goal to support the Irish cause. 
In the Consolation match, Notre Dame battled and fell to Adelphi, by a score of 16-5. Adelphi, who had been ranked fifth in the nation in 1989, and currently resides in the Top 10, simply overpowered the Irish. Again, senior Brian McHugh came through for the Irish with a goal.

Arizona assesses lockout losses 
PHOENIX (AP)-As players returned to Arizona for an ab­breviated spring season Monday, cities around the state began adding up the cost of baseball's 32-day lockout. 
Some of the eight Cactus League teams planned to begin workouts Tuesday and start playing a five-game schedule next week. 
Bob Howard of the Scottsdale Charras said the San Francisco Giants told the Charras to get ready for March 26 and March 28 home games against the Cleveland Indians and Seattle Mariners. respectively.

the Irish was sophomore at­tacker Mike Sullivan, who beat the Adelphi goalkeeper for three goals. 
Despite the· bushels of goals which the Irish surrendered on their three-game swing down the Atlantic coast, the Irish de­fense performed well. Freshman goalkeeper Chris Parent made many very good saves, but he and the Irish de­fense repeatedly encountered difficulties in clearing the ball, putting Notre Dame at a signif­icant disadvantage. 
"Against teams this good, you simply must control the tempo of the game," noted second­year Notre Dame head coach Kevin Corrigan. "But when you play all defense, it is very hard to control the tempo. These 
game season as being an aver­age and say you were going to salvage five-fourteenths of the season, but it really depends on who's your opponent and whether they give you any weekends," Howard said. 
Geoffrey Gonsher, who serves on the Cactus League Task Force, said other factors would determine the amount of loss. 
"One of the major variables is that a lot of the winter visitors who normally stay here through March when we have spring training games have de­cided to return home," he said. "This is the month when every­one starts gathering up their belongings and gets ready." 
The task force has estimated the worth of spring training in the state at about $160 million losses were the fault of the whole team." 
"Our defense was not bad, for as much of it as we played. I can honestly say we did not do a bad job, but when you spend eighty percent of the game playing defense, you will give up some goals. Really, our defen­sive problems were offensive problems. We didn't score well when we had man-up penalty advantages, which you have to do against teams of this cali­bre," said Corrigan. 
Notre Dame next duels with Wooster, on Saturday. March 24, at the Loftus All-Sports Center, before heading to the San Diego State Tournament in San Diego to battle the Air Force Academy. 
annually. Other estimates range downward to about half that amount. 
Robert Brinton, director of Mesa's Convention and Visitors Bureau, said the state figured the absolute value of spring baseball in Arizona and left out revenue which could be offset by tourists who visited the state despite the absence of baseball. 
A survey found about one­fourth of Mesa's winter visitors travel there solely for baseball, Brinton said. 
"The answer for 27 percent was, 'No baseball? We're out of here,"' Brinton added. 
The Chicago Cubs have trained in Mesa for more than 30 years and represent the biggest spring training attrac­tion in the nation, drawing 126,000 fans last year. The California Angels train at Mesa's Gene Autry Park before moving to Palm Springs, Calif., about mid-March for home games, and the Milwaukee Brewers, who play in nearby Chandler, room in Mesa. lead­ing to an estimate of $37.5 mil­lion for baseball's impact in Mesa. 
However, Hinton said the city had projected a loss of $6 mil­lion to $10 million for a spring training wipeout. 
He said he expected the loss to be about $5 million now that some baseball will be played.

says McCann. 
King, meanwhile, edged Greg Gardner of Illinois State University by a 6-5 score in the 190-pound championship. King's record is now 18-15-1, and McCann says he wasn't surprised that his big freshman came through with a win. 
"I felt Steve had a legitimate chance to beat Gardner because he had beaten him earlier in the year. Gardner had also beaten Steve once, but Steve's a fresh­man, and you never know what to expect from a freshman," says McCann. 
McCa-nn said he was disap­pointed that Radenbaugh and Gowens didn't perform better in their Regional final matches, but says that now that they

Women's basketball left bidless 
NCAA tourney selection committee 'snubs' 23-6 Irish 
By CHRIS COONEY Assistant Sports Editor 
The Notre Danw women's basketball team did everything they had to do-yet it still wasn't enough. 
The Irish compiNed their stellar season Marrh 9-I 0 by winning th1~ Midwest Collegiate Confprencc Tournament in Dayton, Ohio, and upping their overall record to 2:J-6, only to be oVPrlooked the next day by the NCAA Tournanwnt Selection Committlp as it dohd out invitations to its national tournament. Despite ending their seasor1 umlefeated in the MCC and riding high on a I2­garne winning streak. Notre Darm~ did not recPive a bid, nvPn aftPr downing Dayton 67­59 and pulling out a 67-66 last­second victory over Butler to daim the tournanwn t cham pi­onship. 
"Tiwy told us al'tPrwards that we Wf'rl' right in thl're until tlw very Pnd," said lwad roach MufiH McCraw of tlw eomrnit­ltw that d1'tPrmi11Pd the 27 schools rPePiving at-largP bids. "Thl're WPre about sPvl'n tPams at tlw PIHI and tlwy picked four of tlwm. It was very disappoint­; ng for us." 
McCraw Pxplairwd that NotrP l>anw's wPak sehPduiP, PspP­cially towards tlw Pnd of its season. and a 7I-64 loss to lkl'aul .Jan. 27, wl'rP key far­tors in the de1·ision. 
"Wiwn DePaul mad1~ tlw tournanwnl, we thought we had a chance," said McGraw. "but our last big win was against VandPrbilt (.Jan. 4) and 1wen though we won our last 12 games, they chose tl'ams like Ohio Stall~ and UCLA who phty1~d schools in the top 15 down tlw line. They lost thosl' ganws. but it didn't matter to tlw selection committee. 
"We got snubbed." 

Part of McGraw's frustration stt~ms from Notre Dame's im­pressive statisties. The Irish b1~at UCLA and Vanderbilt in non-eonfenmce match-ups and won their MCC contests by an average of I6 points. In addi­tion, Notre Dame lead the MCC in total offense and defense, field-goal percentage, rebound­ing and 3-point pnrcentage. 
"We did go S-6 outside of the conference and 2-3 against top­ranked teams," continued Mc<;raw, "but all that really matters is that you play those good llmms. Ohio State and UCLA didn't win tlwir games against the ranked teams and Ohio State lost its last three of live. W1 fPit like we did nwry­thing we could." 
The Irish did receive an invi­tation to tlw NIT tournament, but opted not to attnnd. a deci­sion McGraw clainwd was made Pven beforl' the MCC champi­onships. 
"They ttlw Nrn had asked us if we would still be interestPd in their tournament if wn didn't go tlw the NCAAs," said McCraw. "But at that tinw we only had sPven lwalthy playl'rs and the idea of playing thren ganws in as many days didn't appPal to us." 
DespitP the lack of recogni­tion by thn NCAAs, the MCC tourney did honor thn accom­plishments of individual Irish

While she mad1~ the lirst-tnam aii-MCC squad. classmate Krissi Davis was a second-team selection. Davis lead thn league in field goal pmcentage at .SHO and her 2:B rPbounds (H.O pg.) 
toppPd Notre Dame's stat 
sheets, pladng her fourth in the 
MCCs. Freshman Coquese 
Washington roundnd out the 
thn Irish award-winners by 
making the All-Newcomer 
squad and padng the team in 
stnals with 6 7. 

"I was so happy Karen got 
player of thn year." said 
McGraw. "She really dnsnrvnd 
it. Margarf't Nowlin and Sara 
l.iebseher should have madn all­
ronfPrPnce as wnll. but I don't 
think most coaehns vote for 
mom than two players from 
nach team for that. And Krissi 
should have bnnn first-team 
with thn ynar shn had." 

Thn eonf1rnncP tournamnnt 
highlightPd tlw dnpth of the 
Pight-membf'r Irish squad. In 
thn first game against Dayton, 
all fivn of NotrP Damn's 
starters finislwd scoring in

IS points and 10 assists whiiP 
Davis and Nowlin dominated 
inside, each scoring 12 points 
and tallying II and nirw rn­

"Wn played Wl'll, but we Wl'rl~ n~ally tensl'," rommnnted McGraw. "Dayton was confi­dPnl and rl'laxnd with nothing to los1~.whiiP wn knnw we had to win if we wantnd thn NCAA bid. ThP girls really felt the pres­sure. 
Aftnr getting off to a slow start, we finally relaxed. Even though Dayton play1~d probably their best game of the year, we' nevm felt like the game ·was in jnopardy." 
The next night thn agony con­tinued as Notre Dame squeaked past Butler in the champi­onships. Hobinson's basket with 11 seconds rnmaining put

the Irish up 67-66. McGraw at­
tributed thn near-upset to one 
factor: the loss of Krissi Davis, 
who missed much of the seeond 
half due to foul trouble. 

"When Krissi came out after 
her fourth foul the momentum 
totally swung their way," said 
McGraw, whose team lead by 
14 at the half. "They hit two 
three-pointers in a row and it 
put them right back in it. 

"Without Krissi to hold the 
team together, we had troubles 
bn~aking their press and get­
ting the ball underneath. She's 
always thern to ealm us down. 
I'm happy we had enough com­
posure to pull out the win." 

Making up for Davis's early 
dPparture were Hobinson and 
Nowlin. Hobinson seored 20 
while Nowlin took over down 
low. The sophomore, who was 
nanwd to the all-tournament 
tPam, finislwd with I5 points 
and 12 rebounds. 

Despite the disappointment of 
not receiving the NCAA bid, 
McGraw pointed out the suc­
cess of this year's squad. which 
finished with Notre Dame's 
lJPst record 1wer. 

"This is the first s11ason when 
we could look back and see the 
way each player improved." 
said McGraw. "The attitude 
was tremendous. This unit 
played so well-together and had 
such chemistry. you never knew 
who was going to shinn when. 
Each person had great games 
just wlum we neednd it. 

"The girls didn't earn about 
individual slats. We've got tons 
of individual talent. but that 
doesn't win games-attitude 
does. We just had a cohesive 
team." 

While losing just Lisa Kuhns, the trio of Robinson. Liebscher and Davis should have no trouble filling the leadership roles and incor­porating the incoming fresh­men into the squad. In addition, Notre Dame will combat the problems of a flimsy schedule next season by challenging Louisiana Tech, Stanford and Tennessee, three of the NCAA's top four seeds this year.
