Local teen kills cop near 0-C apartment complex 
Arrest, shooting are 'close to home' for off-campus students 
By HEATHER COCKS News Editor 
A South Bend police officer was killed Sunday night near the Lafayette Square apartment complex, shot four times in the head by a 16 year-old local boy. 
Officer Paul Deguch was driving on Talbot Street, just off S.R. 23, when he stopped to investigate "the out of the ordinary behavior" of a young boy, said Sergeant John Williams of the South Bend Police Department. 
When Deguch approached him, police said, the youth shot Deguch, then fled down a nearby alley. The 30­year-old officer was pronounced dead just after 8:30 p.m. at St. Joseph's Medical Center. 
Police conducted a comprehensive three-hour search of the area in an attempt to apprehend the suspect, later identified as Gregory Dickens Jr., a neighborhood resident. 
John Menghini, a Notre Dame senior, was driving toward Lafayette Square at approximately 11:15 p.m. when he saw the police preparing to arrest Dickens. 
"We were on the way to Lafayette when the cops stopped our car near 
S.R. 23, " Menghini said. "An officer shined a flashlight into our car to see 
who was inside." He said he was stopped again on 

S.R. 23, when several police cars and 

Lf 
more than 20 officers swarmed hooting around one of the houses. Menghini said there was screaming moments before the police rushed to the front door and dragged the suspect from the house. "They were yelling, 'Get your hands away from there, don't reach down there!' I think he must have been reaching for a gun or something," 
Menghini said. "It felt like an episode of 'Cops."' 
Other witnesses confirmed that the shooting and subsequent arrest occurred just a few blocks from Lafayette, which houses a number of off-campus Notre Dame and Saint

Ticket prices stay at $96, $128 
Observer Staff Report 
Breaking a three-year trend of $6 increases, the Notre Dame Ticket Office said general admis­sion and student football ticket prices have not risen this year. 
Notre Dame students, buying each ticket for half the price of a GA. will again pay $96 for their book of six tickets. Saint Mary's students will pay $128, two­thirds of the regular price, and each GA will still cost $32. 
Jim Fraleigh of the athletics department said the decision was not connected with the 

enues. 
"We just sat down and went over the office's budget and fin­ances, and we're doing really well at this point," Fra­leigh said. "We prefer not to raise prices if we can avoid it, so this

-Marilou Eldred, president ofSaint Mary's College 
Eldred prepares to lead SMC community 
By SARAH CORKREAN 
Saint Mary's News Editor 
As attendance at women's colleges continues to decline, many challenges face their advocates, including the new Saint Mary's College president Marilou Eldred. 
As she assumes the leader­ship of one of the top­rated mid­western women's colleges, she is stressing her role as a lay leader, something she believes women need to see more often in today's society. 
"Women's colleges are criti­cal because women need to be able to identify themselves and assume a role in society," Eldred said. "Saint Mary's College prepares women well for that role." 
In April, the Board of Trustees presented Eldred as the 10th president of Saint Mary's. Eldred, who was then the vice president and acade­mic dean of the College of St. Catherine, a Catholic women's college in St. Paul, Minn., assumed the post in June. 
She stated her eagerness to meet with present students and alumnae. She plans on implementing informal recep­tions with groups of students and hosting alumnae reunions to acquaint students with the networking opportunities available within the Saint Mary's community. 


students to initiate conversa­
tion," said Eldred. ''I'm here to 
provide students a mentor, to 
lead them to a degree." 
Already, Eldred has planned 

to host picnics with student 
body leaders and was seen this 
weekend greeting incoming 
freshmen as they unloaded 
their cars. The door of Eldred's 
office has been open for stu­
dents drop in and say hello. 
Mary Lou Garno, chair of the 

Co lege's Board of Trustees, 
introduced Eldred as "the best 
person to lead Saint Mary's 
into the next century." 
She described Eldred's 

accomplishments as a tribute 
to the president's long-held 
goals, which are in accord with 
those of the Saint Mary's mis­
sion statement. 
Revealing her hopes and intentions for the College, Eldred said that she plans to continue to increase the endowment, make available more financial aid, make diversity more of a campus issue and expand both acade­mic programs and enrollment. 
According to Eldred, only 2-3 percent of graduating high school women consider attend­ing women's colleges. 
"Because women's colleges are only able to recruit half of the population, they will always struggle academically," she said. 
One way to increase enroll­ment at Saint Mary's would be to recruit by word of mouth through alumnae, noted Eldred. In this year's incoming freshmen class, 19 percent were recruited through alurp­nae clubs. 
According to Eldred, contact-

Playing God with God Quad 
Another summer, 
another slew of changes 
around campus. 
Forget the impressive 
stadium or the addition 
of women to Golf Quad. 
And who cares about 
RecSports or South 
Dining Hall, both of 
which will not be fin­
ished until long after the 
ground thaws. 
But there is another 
area of campus into which the University felt 
it needed to throw some money: God Quad. 
The circle has been repaved; fresh sidewalks 
radiate from the statue of Jesus, which has a 
new retaining wall and lots of shrubbery ; 
and there are fewer trees and more benches. 
The changes are recent, judging by the 
bare patches of dirt where the liquid grass 
has yet to grow, and the quad should look 
complete by the time NBC-OK, the alumni 
and fans too -returns to campus September 
5. It will sur~ly look better by then. 
But did God Quad need all these improve­
ments? Sure, the road needed repaving and 
the benches are a nice touch. But the extra 
sidewalks and the changes around Jesus look 
gaudy when compared to the simple mound 
and flowers that once surrounded it. 
In making these changes, the University 
removed several trees and bushes that made 
God Quad a unique place on this campus -a 
green, almost wooded area that could seem 
like a forest far away from South Bend. 
Especially at night during a snowfall. 
But the removal of too many trees and the 
addition of too many sidewalks makes God 
Quad just another section of campus deprived 
of the enjoyment of walking through the 
grass, over the roots of an oak and under the 
boughs of an evergreen. 
This University has gone construction­
happy. It began in 1995 with the renovation 
of what is now Bond Hall and will continue to 
1999. And the new golf course could be 
under construction into 2000, depending on 
when the issues with the Department of 
Natural Resources are settled. I will have to 
come back to campus with my own kids to 
see what Notre Dame can look like without 
backhoes and cranes. 
What scares me is all this land that now 
makes up the nine-hole golf course. With the 
new links opening across Douglas Road, will 
the administration be able to keep its hands 
off that undeveloped land? 
Somehow I think not. It would be nice if 
they added more trees and maybe even put in 
some wood-chipped walking trails. But every­
one will be able to get their exercise trekking 
to the new bookstore to open south of the 
Morris Inn on Notre Dame Avenue. 
America has gone development-crazy, and 
Notre Dame is caught in the trap. While the 
federal government actually considers 
reversing advancement by restricting cars in 
some of the great national parks out west, 
the eastern half of the Unites States contin­
ues to cram as many people it can east of the 
Mississippi. I should know, coming from the 
nation's most densely populated state, New 
Jersey. 
Maybe the land in front of the Dome will look better when the grass grows in and the changes are no longer new. But it seems wrong that God's natural creations-the flora that once abounded on the quad ­were removed to "improve" God Quad.

Summer revisions change cover, contents of du Lac 
By MATTHEW LOUGHRAN 
Associate News Editor 
This summer's rev1s1ons have given du Lac new pro­portions, new information and a whole new look. 
"Probably the biggest changes we made are the addition of the academic code of honor, some changes to the chapter on student behavior and the section that we included about student ser­vices," said Bill Kirk, assistant vice president of Residence Life. 
The Campus Life Council, a body composed of students, faculty, rectors and staff, made recommendations for changes during its final meet­ing last year. The senior staff of the Office of Student Affairs, including Professor Patricia O'Hara, Kirk, Sister Jean Lenz, Father Peter Rocca

ing her considerati9n of 
changes to the content and 
presentation of du Lac. The 
only resolution that O'Hara 
initially accepted requested 
that the book include a sec­
tion on student services. 
The second resolution, 
which first met with resis­
tance. asked 0' Hara to 
include a written series of 
rights in disciplinary proceed­
ings. 
O'Hara's response to the 
resolution indicated that she 
wanted to avoid the legalistic 
tone of the word "rights." 
However, the current copy 
of the book says that, "any 
student charged with viola­
tions of University policy is 
entitled to the following rights 
in an Administrative Hearing 
setting." 
Kirk explained that the 
change was made for stu­
dents' ease in understanding. 
"We wanted to keep du Lac 
as educational as opposed to 
legal," said Kirk. "But what 
we did was give a list of what 
the students are entitled to." 
The second resolution asked 
that the senior staff include 
students, rectors and faculty 
in the revision process. 
In her letter of response, 
O'Hara said, "I find myself 
unable to accept this resolu­
tion. 
"New language was added 
to page four of du Lac last 
year that calls upon the assis­
tant vice president of 
Residence Life to identify to 
the Campus Life Council in the 
coming weeks those policies in 
du Lac under consideration 
for revision this summer," 
O'Hara explained in her let­
ter. 
"This allows the Campus Life Council to spend time during the spring semester if it wishes to develop whatever input, perspective or recom­mendations the council would like Residence Life and Student Affairs to consider in the du Lac revision process." 
During the debate over whether the resolution should pass the CLC, Kirk asked that the council give the present process a chance to work before initiating a new one. 
According to the same let­ter, Kirk will review the changes in du Lac for the CLC at its first meeting of the year on Monday. 
The non-discrimination clause on the fou,rth page of du Lac, the subject of a stu­dent rally in April, was one of the aspects of du Lac that was not changed over the summer. 
"That is a matter for the officers of the University," Kirk said. "It is being reviewed by them and was not in our power to change." 
The rally, held by the College Democrats, asked that the officers add sexual orien­tation to the clause.

Mir crew members lose air, may face evacuation 
Failed power systems leave ship unable to generate more oxygen 
By MARCIA DUNN Associated Press Writer 
The three men aboard Russia's run­down Mir space station were left with­out any way to generate oxygen Monday after both their primary and backup systems failed, at least temporarily, NASA reported. 
U.S. space officials said they wouldn't know whether the two Russian cosmo­nauts and one American astronaut on board were able to fix either of the oxy­gen-producing devices until the next scheduled communication with the sta­tion on Tuesday morning. 
Nonetheless, one NASA official called it a potentially serious problem -one that could force an evacuation. 
"It could be that tomorrow it could be no problem, or it could be a fairly signif­icant problem," said NASA spokesman Ed Campion. 
"If you can't get either of the two sys­tems back up, then you're facing a seri­ous situation." 
At the time of the cosmonauts' last communication Monday with Russia's Mission Control outside Moscow, they were struggling to fix the secondary solid fuel-burning system. 
The primary Elektron generator, which had been turned off since last week to conserve power, had shut itself down Monday after it began overheat­ing, Campion said. 
"Before they went to bed, they may have gotten things fixed. We just don't know," Campion said. 
In Russia, calls to Mission Control for comment around midnight Moscow time went unanswered after NASA disclosed the problem. 
If neither oxygen-producing system can be restarted over the next several days, Foale and his two Russian crew­mates would have to abandon ship in the attached Soyuz capsule. 
There have been repeated problems with the new Elektron generator, car­ried up by space shuttle Atlantis in May. But this is the first time since February that a crew has had serious trouble with the backup system, in which solid­fuel canisters are ignited to produce oxygen.

Study: Despair can cause heart problems 
By MELISSA WILLIAMS Associated Press Writer 
DALLAS 

Middle-aged men who feel hopeless or think of themselves as failures may develop athero­sclerosis, the narrowing of the arteries that leads to heart attacks and strokes, faster than their more optimistic counter­parts, researchers report. 
People who expressed high levels of despair had a 20 per­cent greater increase in athero­sclerosis over four years, according to a report in the August issue of the American Heart Association journal Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular Biology. 
"This is the same magnitude of increased risk that one sees in comparing a pack-a-day smoker to a nonsmoker," lead author Susan Everson said Monday. 
"People need to recognize that this sense of giving up that many people feel has strong cardiovascular consequences. 
Steps should be taken to try to change their situation so they gain hope or become more opti­mistic," said Everson, an asso­ciate research scientist at the Human Population Laboratory of the Public Health Institute in Berkeley, Calif. 
Earlier studies have associat­ed hopelessness with heart dis­ease, heart attack and death from heart disease. 
This latest study, ,however, sought to examine the influence of hopelessness earlier in the disease process, while the arteries were in the process of narrowing. 
The findings, while not unex­pected, are still noteworthy, said Dr. Marty Sullivan. a car­diologist and associate profes­sor ofmedicine at Duke University Medical Center. 
"This is one of the first stud­ies of humans that has looked at the actual atherosclerosis process and has shown a strong relationship," he said. "I am not surprised that we have now demonstrated that psychosocial

Therefore, Russian ground controllers can communicate with the Mir only for about 20 minutes each orbit, when the station passes over its territory. 
There was a bit of good news Monday aboard Mir. Commander Anatoly Solovyov reported that power was flow­ing through the makeshift hatch that he and Pavel Vinogradov installed during an internal spacewalk Friday to restore power. 
Indeed, Russian flight controllers veri­fied that an additional 40 amps of elec­tricity were flowing into the station. But commands sent to move three of the four solar panels mounted on the out­side of the ruptured lab module were unsuccessful. 
"There's definitely power coming from the arrays," Campion said. "But how much and what the total capability is is going to take a while to understand." 
Until Monday, the station had been flying at half-power as a result of the June 25 collision with an unmanned cargo ship. 
Russian space officials, meanwhile, disclosed Monday that the collision may have left as many as seven tiny holes in the sealed-ofT Spektr lab module. 
The head of the Russian Space Agency, Yuri Koptev, said the cargo ship bounced ofT Mir seven times. 
Space officials previously said they believed only one or two holes were punched in the Spektr module. 
factors may play a role." 
Atherosclerosis is a progres­sive disease in which fat, cho­lesterol, cellular waste products and calcium collect in the blood vessels, reducing their ability to deliver oxygen and nutrients. 
Exactly how hopelessness speeds up artery narrowing isn't yet clear, Everson said. She noted that depression, anx­iety and other types of psycho­logical stress can affect the body's central nervous system, influencing the production of stress hormones. 
For Everson's project, men participating in a larger heart­disease study in Finland were questioned about their outlook on life. 
Ultrasound scans were used to measure their levels of artery narrowing at the start of the study and four years later. 
The 20 percent greater increase in atherosclerosis lev­els in the most despondent group persisted even when researchers accounted for tra­ditional coronary risk factors such as smoking· and alcohol consumption, as well as the use of cholesterol-lowering and high-blood pressure medica­tions, Everson said. 
The rate of increase was par­ticularly marked among men with early evidence of athero­sclerosis and those with chroni­cally high levels of despair. 
"This indicates that hopeless­ness is probably an exacerbat­ing mechanism," Everson said.

Florida, tobacco industry sign accord 
$11.3 billion deal is 'punishment' to cigarette makers 
By KAREN TESTA Associated Press Writer 
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. 
Florida's war against the tobacco industry ended today with the signing of an $11.3 billion settlement of a lawsuit intended to punish cigarette makers for decades of fraud and racketeering. 
The state also forced the industry to admit in the set­tlement that cigarettes kill and nicotine is addictive, Gov. Lawton Chiles' office said in a news release obtained by The Associated Press before a court hearing where the deal was signed. 
"The tobacco industry very much wanted to settle because our trial is getting closer," said April Herrle, a Chiles spokeswoman. "The clock has been ticking for tobacco." 
Chiles said the state won on three important battle­grounds: "protecting Florida's children, making tobacco pay for the damage it has cost our taxpayers and for cigarette makers to final­ly tell the truth." 
In Philadelphia, meanwhile, a federal judge today set a trial date for another major lawsuit against the industry. 
Chiles and tobacco industry lawyer Arthur Golden signed their agreement in court today before Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Harold Cohen. 
The trial had been in jury selection since Aug. 1. In depositions, tobacco execu­tives had already conceded that smoking is harmful and can cause deadly diseases. Herrle said those admissions helped spur the deal. 
"There was just no way that they could escape," said Bob Montgomery, an attorney for the state. 
In addition to the financial settlement, the industry agrees to pull down all of its billboards within six months and start with signs within 1,000 feet of schools. 
Vending machines where children have access would be removed, and outdoor advertising in sporting are­nas and on mass transit would be banned. 
Florida's settlement "high­lights the fact that we need a national settlement," said John Coale, an attorney who helped negotiate the pro­posed national deal. 
Paul Billings, spokesman for the American Lung Association in Washington, called the agreement "signif­icant, not only in the amount of money but the state of Florida is able to extract 
something  beyond  just  
money."  
In  Philadelphia,  U.S.  

District Judge Clarence Newcomer certified a pend­ing smokers' lawsuit as a class action today and set a trial date of Oct. 14. The law­suit represents some 10 mil­lion smokers who say they were addicted and are seek­ing medical monitoring for smoking-related diseases. 
Newcomer's action makes that the next big tobacco trial, one the industry had furiously sought to put off while Congress debated the proposed national settlement. 
"This is a big deal," John Coale, one the class-action attorneys, said of the Philadelphia action. "It means they've got to hurry up" with ratification of a national settlement. 
Florida is the second state to reach an agreement to recover the Medicaid funds, even as Congress looks over a proposed $368.5 billion national settlement with 40 states. 
Florida has 5 percent of the 
U.S. population, which could give it $18.4 billion in a national settlement. In its lawsuit, the state had asked for $12.3 billion-$1.3 bil­lion for tax money spent treating sick smokers without insurance and $11 billion to punish the industry. 
Mississippi, the first state to take the industry to court, settled its lawsuit July 3 for nearly $3.6 billion, or 1 per­cent of the national settle­ment. The money is guaran­teed even if the national set­tlement is dumped. 
Florida's deal is structured 
much the same way, Herrle 
said. 
"It will we have contingen­cies built in if the global set­tlement comes to pass or in the case that it doesn't," she said.

the company, requires the 
approval of a bankruptcy 
court and a two-thirds major­
ity of women suing the com­
pany. 

The Dow Corning plan ·marks an increase from the 
company's $2 billion share of 
the original, $4.2 billion glob­
al settlement. 
That plan fell apart because 
an unexpectedly high 440,000 
women sought reparation 
payments. 
The offer comes days after 
Dow Corning's half-owner, 
Dow Chemical, lost a key neg­
ligence case in Louisiana over 
implants. 
Jama Russano, who got her 
implant at age 14, said the 
$200,000 payment she could receive wouldn't even cover the nearly $300,000 in med­ical bills she has accrued. 
"I felt almost insulted, I felt like this is such a tragedy," said Russano, 40, of Northport in Suffolk County, N.Y., who had a Dow Corning implant and then got a replacement for more than 20 years. "They're offering women no more than $8,000 for a rupture ... Many women will bear the burden of Dow's mistake." 
The settlement came as part of the reorganization plan Dow Corning was required to file to recover from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

The Necessary Evils of Moving In 

I hate moving in. 
Why is it always such a traumatic experience? The first thing to do is to run up the stairs with the key to your new room, only to be greeted by a whole summer's worth of stale, mildewed air. It will burn your nose hairs upon first contact if you aren't careful. This year, however, I was 
Bridget Rzezutko 
armed with my air freshener. I was victorious, and my nose thanked me. 
The next problem is always the whole cart process. Where are they? Why are there only two for an entire dorm? Now I am all for women's lib until my dad started handing me boxes to schlep upstairs all by myself. 
"What? You want me to carry that? All by myself?" I whined. 
Luckily, my roommate arrived just while I was beginning to experience the possibility of actually participat­ing in physical labor. 
It was a close call. I actually thought I was going to have to do work to get my possessions into the room. We hugged and had to do the stereotypical girl greeting of "hiiiii" at about ten decibels higher than our normal voices. Why we girls have to do this, I have no clue. We all sound like squawking animals in pain that desperately need to be shot and put out of misery. 
Next we both grabbed pillows and our comforters and pretended to look busy working. That was harder than it sounds since we stood in front of the ele­vator for about 15 minutes waiting for it. No, it wasn't the abundance of people who made it so slow; it was us. We were slow. I hear pushing the button actu­ally helps the elevator under­stand where to pick you up. Imagine that. 
After we attended a brief crash course on elevator basics we headed to our room. Both of our mothers 
were sitting on the couch. 

Apparently my mommy dearest had forgotten that mothering was a full-time job and gave rest first pri­ority over helping her youngest daughter move in. I was a little insulted. 
My roommate and I grabbed the cart and started to make another trip to the cars when all of a sudden the wheel flew off of the cart. It's hard to act nonchalant and mature when a wheel has taken flight, almost taking out innocent women and children. A bloodbath could have ensued if it wasn't for my quick thinking in yelling, "Duck!" I saved the day and am still awaiting the presentation of my medal. 
My roommate's brother-in-law was right on our heels carrying an enor­mous box of clothes when he dropped it on the sidewalk, sweaters flying everywhere. Why were all of our possessions airborne? It was pretty funny to everyone but him. I was grateful because it took atten­tion away from our soaring wheel and onto his frantic actions of chas­ing sweaters that were cruising through the air. 
Of course the day would not be complete without a trip to Meijer. Meijer is the greatest store ever invented. Where else can you buy a prom dress, eggs and fishing rods all at the same time? 
However, with every turn of the cart my mom anxiously reminded me, "You DON'T need that!" Like I don't need a combination velvet Elvis wall hanging/ color map of Indiana's scenic South Bend. 
Well I walked away the victor in the battle for use of both carts and elevators with only a few visible scars. But I'll have war stories to one day share with my children.

Comeback is brewing for Milwaukee 
Associated Press 
Phil Garner is happy his Brewers are back at .500, not that Milwaukee is just 3 games behind first-place Cleveland in the AL Central. 
"It's been an objective for us since the start of spring train­ing," he said after Milwaukee beat the Texas Rangers 7-2 Monday night behind Julio Franco's two-run homer. 
"We've been there. We've fallen back," the Milwaukee manager said. "It seems like we keep stubbing our toes on this hurdle." 
Milwaukee (65-65), at .500 for the first time since Aug. 5, has won three straight and eight of 11 to close on the Indians. 
"We're not paying any atten­tion to that right now," Garner said. "We'll address that at the end of the season. Right now we've got to continue doing what we're doing, and that's playing some pretty good ball." 
Joel Adamson (4-2), who started in place of injured Bryce Florie, allowed two runs and four hits in six innings, striking out seven to tie his career high. Florie was scratched Sunday due to a strained right shoulder. 

"He threw the ball well tonight and hit his spots, and we jumped on the board early, which always helps a pitcher," Garner said. "Particularly a guy who doesn't start very often." 
Terry Clark (1-6) lost his third straight start, allowing four runs and eight hits in 2 2­3 innings. After starting off the game by hitting Fernando Vina, Clark never seemed in control. 
"I really didn't stay ahead of the hitters," Clark said. Texas manager Johnny Oates agreed. 
"I don't think Terry ever got into a rhythm, a sequence of pitches," Oates said. "It looked like he hit Vina with a knuckle­ball. His knuckleball is a very good pitch for him. He got behind a lot and never set the tone." 
Milwaukee took a 3-0 lead in the second on Mike Matheny's RBI single, a run-scoring throwing error by shortstop Benji Gil on a potential double­play grounder and Jose Valentin's run-scoring double. 
Mark Loretta's RBI double chased Clark in the third, but Texas pulled to 4-2 on Gil's RBI single in the fifth and Juan Gonzalez's 31st homer one inning later. 
Valentin hit another RBI dou­ble in the seventh, and Franco hit his fifth homer of the sea­son. 
"It was a nice clean, quick game for us," Loretta said. "We got a lot of first-pitch outs. We put up some runs on the board. It was a confidence builder all around." 
Tigers 7, Twins 6 
Brian Hunter's RBI single in the 12th inning off Rick Aguilera gave the Detroit Tigers a 7-6 win Monday night over Minnesota, the Twins' 14th loss in 15 games. 
Minnesota's Paul Molitor went 2-for-5 and moved into 14th place on the career hits list with 3,144. Molitor, who passed Robin Yount (3,142) is just behind Paul Waner (3,152) and George Brett (3,154). 
Brad Radke, attempting to become the second 18-game 
winner in the major leagues, didn't get a decision for the first time in 23 starts since April 27. Radke allowed six runs -his highest total since Aug. 14 against Boston -and six hits in five-plus innings. 
Minnesota dropped its fourth straight. 
Matt Walbeck opened the 12th with a single off Aguilera (4-4), advanced to second on a sacrifice by Deivi Cruz before scoring on Hunter's bloop sin­gle to left. Before Walbeck's single, Minnesota relievers had retired 13 consecutive batters. 
A.J. Sager (3-4) pitched two hitless innings for the victory. 
Rookie Brent Brede drove in three runs for the Twins, going 3-for-3 with his first career homer, a two-run shot. 
Melvin Nieves and Walbeck homered for Detroit. Tigers starter Scott Sanders gave up three runs and six hits in five innings. 
Trailing 6-3, Minnesota tied the score on Denny Hocking's RBI triple off Dan Miceli in the sixth, and Matt Lawton's RBI groundout off Mike Myers and Terry Steinbach's sacrifice fly off Doug Brocail in the seventh.

Steinbrenner looks to broaden horizons 
Yankee owner interested in NY Islanders 
Associated Press 
NEWARK, N.J.-New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner is interested in buying the NHL's New York Islanders, according to a pub­lished report. 
Steinbrenner has made pre­liminary inquiries, through an intermediary, about purchas­ing the Islanders, according to several persons close to the NHL and major league base­ball, the Newark Star-Ledger said Tuesday. 
Steinbrenner was traveling Monday and was unavailable for comment. 
The Islanders are up for sale for the second time in less than a year after John Spano's purchase for $165 million was nullified by the league last month. Spano failed to make several scheduled payments and faces federal fraud charges in several jurisdic­tions, including New York, Texas and Boston. 
Brett Pickett, the son of Islanders owner John Pickett, refused to divulge the identity of any suitors for the team, citing confidentiality agree­ments. 
But Pickett, whose law firm -Richards and O'Neil -is deaL 
Steinbrenner's group pur­chased the Yankees in 1973 from CBS for $10 million. Steinbrenner's family owns 55 percent of the shares in the New York Yankees Partnership, and the team is worth at least $250 million, possibly much more. 
In 1981, Steinbrenner seri­ously weighed a bid to buy the NHL's Colorado Rockies, but was beaten out by rival and former Yankees limited part-· ner John McMullen, who moved the team, now the New 
Jersey  Devils,  to  the  
Meadowlands.  
In  the  late  1980s,  

Steinbrenner also made pre­liminary inquiries about the availability of the NBA's New Jersey Nets. 
Between September 1991 and May 1992, Steinbrenner owned a single-digit minority in the NHL's Tampa Bay Lightning. 
His interest was bought out by a Japanese corporation, Kokusai Green Co. Ltd., which owns the team. 
Four major league baseball teams -Anaheim (Walt Disney Co.), Atlant-a (Time Warner Inc.). the Chicago White Sox (Jerry Reinsdorf) and Florida (H. Wayne Huizenga) -have controlling owners who also control a major league team in another professional sport.

Cubbies finally catch Fish, snap Fernandez's streak 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -The Marlins and 
Alex Fernandez had been domi­
nating the Cubs all season. 
On Monday night, Chicago finally broke through. 
"They beat on us all year, and it's good to get it off our back," Doug Glanville said after his two-run, bases-loaded single in the seventh sparked the Cubs' 3-1 victory. 
Chicago entered the game 0-7 against the Marlins and 0-3 versus Fernandez (16-9). The Cubs finally beat the former White Sox ace by stringing together five straight singles in the seventh to snap Fernandez's six-game winning streak. 
"He's been tough. He spots his pitches so well. He's got such command that he'll get you leaning," Glanville said. 
Kevin Tapani (3-3) one run and seven hits in seven innings, beating his former White Sox teammate. 
"You don't want to tip your cap too much to Alex," Tapani said. "We came through. It was nice to win against these guys." 
In his three previous outing against the Cubs, Fernandez had allowed just two earned runs in 24 2-3 innings. He pitched a one-hitter at Wrigley -losing a no-hitter in the ninth -on April 10. 
On Monday night he gave up nine hits in seven innings. 
"They stuck together five hits. Out of the five, three were jam shots. Sometimes it's better to be lucky than good," Fernandez said. 
"He (Glanville) threw the bat at it and hit it into right field. It just didn't work for me or the whole team." 
In the seventh, Kevin Orie, Scott Servais and pinch-hitter Dave Clark delivered consecu­tive hits to tie the game 1-1. Lance Johnson, out of the start­ing lineup for a fourth straight game because of a strained rib cage muscle, followed with a pinch-single to load the bases.

Glanville then delivered a two-run single to right to put the Cubs ahead 3-1. He was out

at second trying to stretch, and Johnson was caught off third and also tagged out on the play to end the inning. 
Gary Sheffield walked, Bobby Bonilla singled and Darren Daulton followed with a double to give the Marlins a 1-0 lead in the fourth. 
In Tapani's previous outing, against the Marlins five days earlier, he lasted 3 2-3 innings, giving up six runs and six hits. 
"He was much more aggres­sive this outing than he was last," Marlins manager Jim Leyland said. 
Expos 2, Cardinals 1 
ST. LOUIS -Pedro Martinez has been so good this season that it's getting tough for him to impress anyone. 
Martinez struck out 13 in 8 2­3 innings Monday night to lead the Montreal Expos to a 2-1 win over the St. Louis Cardinals. 
Martinez (15-6) allowed four hits, walked two and lowered his major-league leading ERA to 1.61. He set a career best for victories, topping his 14-10 record in 1995. 
"He's been better than that," Alou said. "That is just a nor­mal presentation. Every five days is the highlight of our life." 
Martinez reached double dig­its for the 14th time this season and the 22nd time overall, rais­ing his season total to 245. He has fanned 26 in his last two appearances against the Cardinals. 
Cardinals catcher Tom Lampkin, who got St. Louis' first hit in the fifth inning, said he is not surprised by Martinez's totals. 
"He's got four strikeout pitch­es and most pitchers don't," Lampkin said. "He can strike you out with a changeup, his fastball, or his breaking ball. He's dominating, and he was dominating tonight." 
Martinez was pleased with is performance. 
"It went pretty good," he said. "I had command of all my pitches and I was able to get ahead of everybody early. That made my day easier." 

Darrin Fletcher hit a solo homer and Mike Lansing had an RBI single off St. Louis starter Manny Aybar (0-3). Aybar allowed five hits and two runs in eight innings. 
Through the first eight innings, Martinez allowed only back-to-hack singles in the fifth to Lampkin and Royce Clayton. Phil Plantier doubled to open the ninth and went to third on a groundout. 
Gary Gaetti followed with a fly ball to deep right that rookie Vladimir Guerrero caught with a leap at the wall. 
"That ball was over the fence when he caught it," Alou said. "He robbed them of the game." 
Ron Gant followed with a double and Martinez was replaced by Ugueth Urbina, who retired Lampkin on a fly to right for his 21st save. 
Martinez wouldn't have mind­ed an opportunity to record his 12th complete game. 
"I felt cocky about it," Martinez said. "I thought I could get that last batter." 
St. Louis manager Tony La Russa had seen enough. 
"This is one of those days when its real tough to say the offense had much to hit at," La Russa said. 
Montreal, which has scored only 28 runs in Martinez's last 17 starts, got another run in the eighth when Mark Grudzielanek doubled and scored on Lansing's single. 
Giants 7, Mets 1 

NEW YORK -Brian Johnson hit a two-run homer and Shawn Estes beat New York for the third time this season Monday night, leading the San Francisco Giants to a 7-1 win over the Mcts. 
The Giants, who fell out of first place for the first time since May 10 after Sunday's loss in Pittsburgh, broke a sea­son-high three-game losing streak. The Mets lost for the 11th time in 16 games. 
Johnson, acquired July 16 from Detroit, has hit three of his seven homers this season against New York. The catcher has 21 career homers in four years, seven against Mets pitch­ers. 
Like Johnson, Estes (17-4) has also had great success vs. the Mets. The left-bander improved to 4-0 in his career against New York, including wins in all three starts this sea­son. He allowed six hits and one run in 6 2-3 innings. 
Estes walked three, struck out seven and threw three wild­pitches. He also went 2-for-3 and scored a run. 
Jose Vizcaino singled with two outs in the second off Bobby Jones (13-8) and Johnson followed with an oppo­site-field homer to right-center. 
Estes left after consecutive infield singles with two outs in the seventh. Roberto Hernandez relieved and got Bernard Gilkey on a groundout to end the inning. 
Hernandez and Rod Beck pitched hitless relief over the final 2 1-3 innings. 
Edgardo Alfonzo and Bernard Gilkey singled to start the Mets' sixth, and one out later, Butch Huskey's single made it 2-1. But Estes retired Alex Ochoa on a groundout and Luis Lopez on a broken-bat liner to escape trouble. 
The Giants rallied to score runs with two outs in the sev­enth. Jones had retired 14 of 15 before Estes singled and scored when Darryl Hamilton doubled over center fielder Brian McRae's head. Bill Mueller fol­lowed with an RBI single to chase Jones. 
Glenallen Hill hit a 452-foot, two-run homer in the eighth inning to put San Francisco ahead 6-1. 
Mueller, who was 3-for-4, singled and scored in the ninth when McRae dropped Barry Bonds fly ball at the warning track. 
Jones allowed eight hits and four runs in 6 2-3 innings. He is just 1-5 in his last 11 starts.

Smith and Joe Randa home­red on consecutive pitches off relief ace Todd Worrell in the ninth and the Pirates, on the verge of being swept, stunned the Los Angeles Dodgers 4-3 Monday night to split their dou­bleheader. 
Even before his teammates had finished celebrating Randa's tying two-run shot, Smith won it with a drive into the left-field seats. It was just short of the spot of his dramatic three-run homer that decided the Francisco Cordova-Ricardo Rincon 10-inning no-hitter against Houston on July 12. 
"This might have been the most exciting finish of the sea­son -even more exciting than the no-hitter," Smith said. 
Randa hadn't homered since June 13, only to follow ex­Dodgers first baseman Eddie Williams' leadoff walk with a shot to straightaway center that Otis Nixon nearly vaulted the wall to catch. 
"I'm so exhausted, I almost don't have words to describe it," Randa said. "It was anoth­er storybook finish in a story­book season. We were exhaust­ed, down and dragging, ready to lose a doubleheader and we won the game. I think we're all running out of words to describe what's happening to us this season." 
The Pir-ates, unanimously forecast to finish last in the NL Central, trail Houston by three games after winning their sixth in eight games and 10th in 14. They are 20 games ahead of their last-place pace of a year ago. 
Remarkably, Smith nearly stepped out of the box as he waited for the fans to quit cheering Randa's homer, only to see Worrell go into his deliv­ery. 
"He started winding up and I'd figured I'd stay in there and hack," Smith said. 
Good idea. And a bad, bad loss for the Dodgers, who on Sundaytook over the NL West lead for the first time since April 13.

World of tennis honors Ashe 
tice once against her sister, Serena, when they thought the bullets were headed their way. 
Williams' arrival at the U.S. Open, appropriately enough, came amid the birthday cele­bration of another black tennis pioneer, Althea Gibson, who turned 70 and won the first of her two straight national singles titles 40 years ago. A few months ago, Williams got the chance to talk with Gibson on the phone. 
"It was definitely a privilege playing on this court," Williams said. "And it was definitely a perfect name to name the court after. Arthur did a lot for the game, a lot for the world. He was a great role model. Not just on the court, but ofT the court. 
"For players like myself and a lot of other African-American players on the tour. (Gibson) paved the way for us. So it's important that we recognize this. that I recognize it, and for me to know my history." 
Williams never doubted, even as a young girl, that she would one day play in the U.S. Open. 
"When Serena and I played, we always just expected to be here," she said. "When I was 10, I had been playing, like, six years. So it was just what I expected, not what I hoped. I just knew I would be there." 
Of her 119 mph ace, which matched the fastest serve of her career and was just a bit off Brenda Schultz-McCarthy's 123 mph record. Williams noncha­lantly said she could hit it that fast whenever she wants. 
"She's a breath of fresh air," McEnroe said. 
Two-time women's champion Monica Seles, seeded No. 2 behind Martina Hingis, cruised predictably past Kristie Boogert. 6-1, 6-2 in the evening's first match. Seles showed no fatigue from the fever and sore throat that forced her to default from a tuneup tournament near Atlanta last week. 
Change was in the air all around the U.S. Open during the balmy afternoon as teen­agers Anna Kournikova and Lilia Osterloh also scored impressive victories. 
Kournikova, a 16-year-old who is one of the most promis­ing prospects on the women's tour, crushed Sabine Appelmans 6-2, 6-0. Kournikova reached the fourth round of the Open last year in her Grand Slam debut. 
The 19-year-old Osterloh, who won the NCAA title last spring as a freshman at Stanford after leading the school to the team champi­onship, gained her first victory as a pro by beating Barbara Rittner 6-3, 1-6, 6-3. 
The first match in Arthur Ashe Stadium was won by Tamarine Tanasugarn, a 20­year-old from Thailand, who beat Chanda Rubin 6-4, 6-0. 
Men's No. 4 Goran Ivanisevic. who has been making an art of getting upset in curious ways in Grand Slam matches, fell 4-6. 7­5, 6-1, 7-6 (7-3) to No. 91 Dinu Pescariu of Romania. Ivanisevic lost in the first round at the French Open to Magnus Gustafsson, then lost in the sec­ond round at Wimbledon to Magnus Norman despite serving 46 aces. 
This time, lvanisevic served a mere 24 aces, played from the baseline as if he were on clay. and dumped a lot of balls into the net.

Associated Press 
NEW YORK (AP) -In a spec­tacular tribute to Arthur Ashe. the greatest collection of tennis champions ever assembled gathered Monday night at the dedication of the new U.S. Open stadium named in his honor. 
The emotional one-hour cere­mony epitomized the dignity and grace that characterized Ashe's life, and the mood of the night blended solemnity with joy. 
Ashe "embodied the best in tennis and sports," John McEnroe told the sellout crowd of 22,500. "He was a remark­able athlete who led an even more remarkable life .... He was far and away the greatest ambassador tennis has ever had." 
South African Bishop Desmond Tutu, paying homage to Ashe for joining the fight against apartheid, was among the dozens of celebrities attend­ing the ceremony. 
Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe received two warm, standing ovations from the crowd as she spoke of her late husband's emphasis on "inclusion" in ten­nis and in all walks of life. 
From Don Budge and Jack Kramer to Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg, from Louise Brough to Billie Jean King, from Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova to Monica Seles and Steffi Graf, 37 U.S. singles champions from the past 60 years attended the ceremony. 
Among the notable absentees was Andre Agassi. who attend­ed aplayers' dinner earlier in the evening but skipped the cer­emony. The crowd booed when 
it  was  announced  he  was  
"unable to attend.••  
Whitney Houston sang  "One  

Moment in Time" as scenes of the champions in action were shown on the two giant screens atop the new stadium. and fire­works lit up the night sky at the end of her song. 
There were scenes of Ashe teaching children, one of his life's passion, and winning the first title of the Open era in 1968 and Wimbledon in 1975. 
Five years ago at a clinic for juniors, 12-year-old Venus Williams met Ashe and posed with him for a photograph she keeps among her tennis trea­sures. 
On Monday, in a match that would have made Ashe proud, Williams debuted at the U.S. Open on the first day of play in Arthur Ashe Stadium and drilled a 119 mph ace on her final point to close out a 5-7, 6­0, 6-1 victory over Larisa Neiland. 
Ashe devoted his last years to encouraging inner city kids like Williams, who learned the game on the courts of Compton. Calif., on the southern edge of Los Angeles, where the sound of gunfire was not too distant. She still remembers stopping prac­

hards polish off the last of the "floaters." Finally, 8 a.m. approaches, and sore-headed students stumble up and into a mad dash for the ticket win­dow. 
Unfortunately, getting to the camping grounds early doesn't guarantee one a good spot in line. The first person to set up· camp may get lost in the shuf­fle or trampled on prior to the first ticket sale. Often times, the most physical students reap the rewards of the best tickets. Nevertheless, the adventure comes to a happy conclusion when the student, with ticket in hand, is free to go home and revel in his or her accomplish­ment. 

The ticket itself stands as a symbol of the special aura or rare camaraderie among stu­dents that emerges over the course of this unforgettable evening. Maybe it's the stars in the sky or the smell of cheap beer that permeates the air, but there is something magical about an event where friends get together and create memo­ries that will last forever. 
So as the annual event approaches, it is important to make the most of this special occasion. There are only so many opportunities to experi­ence the thrill of Ticket Night, and regret seems to go hand in hand with skipping out on the event. 
Indeed, missing this tradition is like missing part of Notre Dame.

outstanding characteristic of the match was solid defensive play on both sides of the field. Despite firing just nine shots on goal to Marquette's 10, Notre Dame limited the Golden Eagles to only one shot in the first half, and goaltender Greg Velho made two saves to claim the shutout. 
The strong defensive performance by the Irish appears to be a sign that the graduation of key seniors Brian Engesser and Peter Cansler will not be detrimental to the suffocating style of defense that propelled Notre Dame to success in last year's historic season. 
The Big East coaches gave the Irish a third place ranking in the pre-season poll. Last season the team finished fourth in the regular season. 
Only St. John's, last season's NCAA champions and Rutgers stand above the Irish in the pre-season rankings.

You did not submit your married friend's birth date. However, you above all other signs should not be impressed by someone who will cheat on her husband.

Lady Irish tame Tigers in pre-season contest 
Notre Dame 
dominates in 
1997 debut 
By JOE CAVATO Assistant Sports Editor 
Chris Petrucelli's squad was up to its old tricks of a year ago this past Sunday when they hosted the Missouri Tigers in an exhibition match. Leading the way were junior 

\ Monica Gerardo and senior

\ ~. 
Holly Manthei. Gerardo netted a hat trick and added two assists in the 11-0 thrashing. Manthei. who set a women's soccer collegiate record for assists last season, had three in the contest. 
"For a first game, I think we came out well and had a good showing," said Gerardo. "There's room for improve­ment, but at this stage, I think we're pretty happy where we are. There's a long way to go though." 
Also getting in on the fun was sophomore Jenny Streiffer with two goals and two assists. 

Streiffer opened the scoring just 2:09 into the game with a ... header delivered on a cross by Manthei. Fourteen minutes later, sophomore Kara Brown and Gerardo scored back-to­hack goals in a two-minute span to close the scoring for the 
half. 
In the second stanza, junior Laura Vanderberg delivered a goal in the 51st minute, and sophomore Jenny Heft scored twice in two minutes to open up the game for the Irish. 
The Class of 2001 also wrote its names in the box score with Monica Gonzalez and Meotis Erikson both finding the back of the net at Alumni Field. 
"The freshmen have played really well for us," said Gerardo. "We lost a lot to grad­uation, but they have helped pick up the slack. That has really been the key so far this year." 
The second-ranked Irish com­pletely dominated the Tigers as the hosts amassed 4 7 shots on goal compared to just three for Missouri. Netminder LaKeysia Beene, who is looking to fill the shoes of all-world Jen Renola, recorded two saves on her way to the shutout on a day in which her skills were not need­ed or tested frequently. 
"LaKeysia didn't get too many chances, but she made the plays when she had to," said Gerardo. "Jen was a great player, and we will miss her, but Lakeysia will do a good job, and we'll be fine at goal." 
Midfielder Anne Makinen, a midfielder from Kelsinki, Finland, made her first appear­ance in the Blue and Gold, notching five shots on goal in

ND clips wings of Eagles 
By BRIAN REINTHALER Assistant Sports Editor 
The 1997 edition of the Notre Dame men's soccer pro­gram has a great deal to live up to after a season in which a senior-led squad not only qualified for the NCAA tourna­ment by capturing the Big East tournament champi­onship, but secured the school's first ever NCAA tour­nament victory over highly­seeded UNC-Greensboro. 
If last night's pre-season contest between the Irish and the Golden Eagles of Marquette is any indicator though, the team may be well on its way to achieving such a standard. 
In the only exhibition match the team will play before opening the regular season on Friday, Aug. 29 at conference foe Pittsburgh, the Irish nipped Marquette by a score of 1-0. Sophomore Andrew Aris, who scored three goals and recorded five assists late in his freshman season, picked up right where he left off in 1996 by registering the only tally of the game.

Indeed, camping out for football tickets has reached epic proportions. 
The participation rate is sim­ply phenomenal, and the mem­ories that it produces rank among the finest in one's four years of college. While the pursuit of the tickets stems from the enormous popularity of Irish football, the tradition can clearly stand on its own. 
Every student is guaranteed a season ticket, so it is hardly imperative that a student sac­rifice an entire night to be a few seats closer to the 50-yard­line. 
The Notre Dame football ticket is the most sought after 
aJ 
one in ihe nation. Fans from across the globe would do or give just about anything to score a ticket to just one game. 
However, that is not what makes Ticket Night so popular among the students. Camping out for tickets is not just about football; it is clearly much more than that. 
Students sacrifice sleep, com­fort, and sometimes even the next day's classes for the thrill of this annual event. In one way or another, the night touches everyone involved in a unique way. 
For many, it is an all night party. Frosty beverages in the shadows of the JACC certainly help get the ball rolling, but we're not talking about a crowded dorm party or an evening at Bridget Maguire's. 
By midnight of the special evening, people have staked their ground near the gates of the Joyce Center and are pre­pared for battle. At around 2 a.m., the crowd becomes rau­cous, and the bushes at the rear of the JACC begin to serve a new role. 
By 5 a.m., many have passed into a slumber, while the die-
