Kills 1, injures 5 


40mm shell explodes 
POWHATAN, Va. (AP) ­One student was killed and five others injured when a 40mm artillery shell exploded in the classroom of a private school here. One of the injured teenagers reportedly brought the projectile into the building, but authorities were not sure why. 
Police said 11 persons were in the industrial arts classroom at Huguenot Academy, just west of Richmond, at the time of the blast. 
The shell reportedly had been found on an Army base. It was locked in a vise and being drilled open when it exploded. 
The dead boy was identified 
as Scott Goodman, 14, son of 
Mr. And Ms. Robert M. Good­
man of Richmond. 
Three of the injured, all teenaged boys, were in critical condition at a Richmond hospi­tal. Two other youngsters were admitted to the hospital. 
Three others in the class­room, were less seriously hurt and did not require hospitaliza­tion. 
Assistant Headmaster James Da.vidson said the shell had been brought to the school by one of the injured students, but declined to reveal the name of the. youth. 
State police said they were told the live artillery shell had been found at Ft. Pickett, an Army base in southside Virginia now used primarily for the summer training of National Guardsmen. 
A 40 mm round was used primarily in antiaircraft guns. The Army doesn't use them anymore, but military officials said National Guard and Re­serve units may still have some. The shell is about six inches 
-
long and two inches in diameter. School authorities said they were questioning several stu­
. dents in an effort to find out why , the shell was brought to the school and why an effort was made to dismantle it. 
Windows of the industrial arts classroom at the campus-style, 800-student private secondary school were blown out by the blast a~d fragments of the shell were embedded in the walls. 

Too many activities? 




North Quad dance fails 
by AUcia Denefe Staff Reporter 

Too many activities on campus? This seemed to hinder attendance figures at both the North Quad dance held Feb. 18 and a Student Union sponsored dance at Saint Mary's Feb. 5. 
Grace Hall President Terry Phil­bin, who organized the dance last Friday in the North dining hall, said it "was running against a lot of other activities." He cited Mardi Gras and Tennessee Williams' talk at the Sophomore Literary Festival as the main competition. 
The dance, with music by "Sa­hara", was scheduled to run from 8 to 12 p.m., but closed down early because of poor attendance. Philbin admitted that publicity got out late. He also noted that another negative factor was the $1 cover charge. ' 
"Last year for a similar activity there was free admission and we drew a big crowd," Philbin said. "This year finances were in a bad state and we were forced to ask the admission fee." 
Philbin stated that enough mo­ney was allocated to pay for the band and that further activities are being planned to make up for the remainder of the financial loss.

His comments will center on how to decide which major to pick and how to do so. 
"My advice will be directed to 'hose who really have not made up their minds yet," he said. "Those who have-definitely decided on business as their major are wel­come, but really don't need to attend."

Puritans. Calvinists responsiblefor prevailing American-a_ttit~des .. _ 
· by Marian mtcny Senior Staff Reporter 
"In America, there was no real 
philosophy independent of religion 
until after the Civil War," Dr. 
Murrary Murphey, ofthe American 
Civilization Department at the Uni­
versity of Pennsylvania, stated last 
night in his discussion of "Early 
American Philosophy.'' 
"Different sets of beliefs--Qua­
kers, Puritans, Catholics--were 
brought to the colonies, and minor­
ities became majorities," Murphey 
explained to an audience of approx­
imately 70 in the Galvin Life 
SCience auditorium. "It is not 
surprising that the opportunity for 
development in America caused 
the ideas brought from Europe to 
evolve in strange and wonderful 
ways." 
According to Murphey, the first 
intellectual leaders were members 
of the Puritan clergy whose beliefs 
centered around the absolute sov­
ereignty of God, the catastrophic 
fall of man from innocence to sin, 
and the infallibility of the Bible. 
In addition, the Calvinistic doct­
rine of predestination prompted the 
their "Ask Me to Dance Dance" held in Regina Hall at St. Mary's "could have been potentially more successful." He commented that the 300 to 400 people that did attend "had a good time." Saddler said that he prefers to measure the success of an acitivity "on how much people enjoyed it, rather than how many people were there." 
Saddler said that perhaps the time scheduled for the dance was not an "active period." "Student Union has 14 weekends to work with in the semester and activities must be coordinated with studying trends, as well as other major activities on campus," he explain­ed. 
"There is a problem of co­ordinating events on campus. A constructive effort should be made to equally schedule popular events throughout the year and not to sch~dule popular events on the same weekend as weaker ones," Saddler continued. He cited pre­vious activities such as the snow sculpture contest and Mardi Gras construction as competition and added that perhaps students were not "up for a dance." , 
Saddler · stated that StuC:ent Union will announce the date for a forum to be held in LaFortune ballroom to discuss what activities Student union should hold on campus.

Puritans to constant self-examma­tion in order to gain saving grace, Murphey continued. "Few men have driven themselves so mercil­essly to attain an unattainable 
holiness as the New England 
saints," he added. 
The Puritans experienced diffi­culties in gaining sufficient conver­sions to their ideas in second and third generation offspring, .Mur­phey stated. A new system of idealism emerged which combined sensttlvtty ot ~en to moral dtstmt­tions evolved mto the study of all activities which included moral decisions, from economics to mari­tal rights," he added. 

Scottish realism was not only an empirical! discipline, but "a guide (or action toward socially desirable results,'' Murphey pointed out. Jefferson's political theory concer­ning faith in the common man was influenced by !his nece_ssity to confine such fatth only m those 
the scie'ntiftc theories of Sir Isaac , men with a strong moral sense, he 
Newton and the epistemology of John Locke. Idealism was suppor­ted by ministers such as Samuel Johnson and Jonathan Edwards. The new system of beliefs was ''a response to the scientific revolu­tion," Murphey stated. "It was a reaffirmaticm of religious doctrine with scientific principles." 
Idealism restored the eminence of God in nature and taught the world was ideal as existed in the mind of God, Murphey explained. It also set forth the theory of virtue which defined beauty as symmetry and "harmonious spirits based on mutual love," he added. 
The rival ideology to idealism arose in Scottish realism which became the dominant philosophy in America from 1767 to 1867. According to Murphey, the New England Calvinists looked to Scot­land for intellectual leadership from leading universities such as Aberdeen and Glasgow. 
Scottish realism stressed the 
scientific investigation of the pro­
cess of knowing. In addition, an 
awareness of moral intuition devel­

of moral "sickness" was frequently 
invoked in courts of law and figured

High Quality Festival 
It began three weeks ago, one week after ABC's presentation of Roots captured record audiences across the country. It is, in a sense, a continuation of that story.· 
Designed as an "i.Q.quiry into Modem Black America,'' the fourth Black Cultural Arts Festival has featured prominent black men and women from business, politics, athletics and the arts. 
Remembering that no one person can claim to speak for every member of his race, the Festival planners have done a conscientious job of inviting black speakers of differing viewpoints. This was aptly illustrated by the opening back-to-back appearances of Gary Cooper, an Alabama state representative and Vietnam veteran, and Imamu Amiri Baraka (l.eroi Jones), noted literary figure and chairman of the Revolutionary Communist League. 
To explore the entire culture of a people in a three-week period with a limited budget is obviously an impossible task. Still; the organizers of the Black Cultural Arts Festival have demonstrated a great deal of thought and initiative in planning events and selecting guest speakers in COI).junction with other University organi­zations. 
The events of the past two weeks included apearances of an operatic soprano, an Olympic track star and the female owner of an advertising agency. We had soul food in the dining halls, art exhibi­tionf1 in the ISIS gaUery and a fashion show in the Monogram Room. 
But the Black Cultural Arts Festival is not yet over. There is still another dimension to be presented. Tonight there will b.e a "Gospel Festival" in St. Mary's little Theatre, and the three-week pro­gram will close S1mday with a Gospel church service delivered by a Notre Dame student and minister. 
Frank White, Peter Cannon and their committee are to be congratulated on the variety and quality of the festival their efforts have produced.

P.O. Box Q 
Amused by Editorial 
Dear Editor: I read with great amusement your editorial of 18 February entitled "Revised SLF Succeeds." This apparent attempt to claim some part in the success of the Sophomore Literary Festival was ridiculous, absurd, and in keeping with your usual pedestrian pedan­tries. In November of last year, you excoriated Mr. Santos and mem­bers of the committee for suppos­edly trying to attract only a limited group of literary figures for their own selfish reasons. Then, you proceeded to snipe at the festival and certain literary figures at every opportunity. Now, for you claim to have had anything to do with the Festival, except an attempted belittlement of members of the committed and their efforts, is outrageous. After having attended several sessions of the SLF !.lnd having seen the efforts of the SLF committee, I am appalled at your vainglorious ed­itorial and would have expected better from your Grub and Fleet street colleagues. If you were guided by the same ethical considerations that you asked the SLF committee to have in their search for authors, i.e. consid­eration for all segments of the Notre Dame community, you would · open a free tedium shot clinic for your readers in view of the daily doses of boredom and ennu·i to which you subject them. In short, your own earlier ethical standards towards literary taste demands that you should print an apology to Mr. Santos and mem­bers of the committee, to the University community for your attempt to poison a great event, and, finally,· for your unfair and premature judgment of the Sopho­more Literary Festival. Brian Rice 
Criticism 


Ignorant 

Dear Editor: The Observer editorial of Febru­ary 18 marks and end, one hopes, to an unfortunate series of events · which unnecessarily cast a shadow upon this year's Sophomore Liter­ary Festival. As the editorial re­calls, in November 1976 The Ob­server printed an attack upon the SLF, unjustly calling into CIUestion the good faith of Chairman John Santos in his efforts to select speakers for the Festival. The Ob­server criticism was characterized 
primarily by an ignorance of the facts; the artists to which tfte editorial rather confusedly referred as "obscure international poets" have indeed won international ac­claim in their fields, and so are by no means obscure; as ·examples, David Ignatow is the recent winner of the prestigious Bollingen prize for his work, and Denise Levertov is generally recognized as the premier female poet alive today. 
Clearly then, The Observer fail­ed in its journalistic obligation to research and report the truth in November; and this recent self­congratulatory editorial only serves to promulgate the offense. The happy outcome of the Sophomore Literary Festival was due, not to the premature and ill-considered "warning" of The Observer, but rather to the good will and effort of the entire SLF committee. And the final success of the Festival rests with the participation and spirit of the artists and members of the Notre Dame community who joined together for a week, in honest celebration of literature.

Hesburgh Criticicized 
Dear Editor: 
It is certainly true that the Rockefeller foundation does many commendable things such as sup­porting the Green Revolution. Does Father Hesburgh hope to use this as justification for the fact that 10 percent of its budget is admittedly spent on techniques and logistics for killing unborn children through­out the world? Such logic is reminiscent of those who excused Mussolini because he made the trams run pn time or Hitler because he restored national pride in Ger­many. 
Father Hesburgh's public role in apologizing for the Rockefeller foundation is yet another indication of his willingness to offer his own well-deserved prestige and that of a great Catholic University in support of dubious causes. He nevertheless persists in refusing to place Notre Dame on record with an official statement of condemna­tion of abortion or support ofpro-life efforts. 
Over and above the possible scandal involved in such a paradox­ical position, he continues to en­gage publicly in unfortunate ad­hominem attacks on sincere mem­bers of the pro-life movement. 
Who snould be the role models for Notre Dame students? Should we emulate those who work unsel­fishly in support of life or the social manipulators who use the hJ.lge Rockefeller fortune to promote 
death? Marybeth Diamond

SMC proposal to replace Frosh Officers 
by Mar1f Hogan St. Mary's Editor 

Saint Mary's Student Assembly unanimously passed a proposal to elect a freshman council to replace the positions of freshman officers. 
The proposal, introduced by Kathy Murphy, vice president of Student Affairs, will become effec­tive in the fall. 
According to Murphy, one re­presentative will be elected for every 25 freshmen with the stipu­lation that there must be at least one representative from each hall. 
"It's a good chance to get more people involved," Murphy said, explaining the reasoning behind the proposal. She cited this year's freshman elections as an example. "Twenty-eight kids ran and only four were elected. It's hard to get the 24 to work for the four who beat them," she said. 
Murphy also pointed to the past apathy of St. Mary's student in Student Government saying, "People have a tendency to lose interest in Student Government after freshman year. With the council, we hope to widen the base and keep more students in Student Government.'' 
The vice president of Student Affairs will chair the freshman council for the first semester as well as represent it on the Board of Governance. Second semester, a· chairperson will be elected from within the council and the vice president will then act as an advisor. 
"We'll spend a lot of time first semester in workshops to help students define what their place in Student Government is," Murphy stated. The workshops will give the council members necessary exper­ience in Student Government be­cal!se "so many freshmen are in a cloud about what they can do and what they can't." 
Murphy stressed the importance of increased freshman participation in Student Government. "We will not see the difference now, but in four of five years it'll show up. We'll have a larger number of experienced upperclassmen in Stu­dent Government.'' 
Student Assembly has not yet decided on the "exact criteria" for 

electing the council members. "For example we don't know how many

Notre Dame's Toby Knight: the Irish 'Mr. Dependable' 
by Frank LaGrotta Sports Writer 

Somehow you know he's going to be there...the guy you can count on to get the job done. The Buffalo Bills depend on O.J. Simpson, the Cincinnati Reds' line-up boasts Joe Morgan, and in Philadelphia, Julius "Doctor J" Erving is the 76ers bread and butter man. Yes, every team has one and Notre Dame's basketball team is no exception. At 6-9, 210 pounds, senior forward Toby Knight has 
done  it  all  for  Digger  Phelps'  
cagers.  
Averaging  14  points  and  11  

rebounds per tilt, Knight has displayed a consistency on the court that has resulted in him being considered one of the top college basketball players in . the nation, and a safe pick for a spot in the NBA draft. Knight contemplates his future realistically. 
"With the NBA-ABA merger, there's a large surplus of basket­ball players in the country," Knight points out. "The important thing is not being drafted but actually making the team. I'm leaving the option open if things work out that way, but I am not going to base all my future plans on the NBA. I used to say that you need something to fall back on but I recently received a letter from my brother who told me I need some­thing to fall forward on and that's how I look at my Notre Dame degree." 
Knight, an American Studies­Communication Arts major, antici­pates the opportunity to further his education by attending graduate school upon his graduation from Notre Dame. 
"I've applied to UCLA and Syracuse," reveals the articulate senior, "and I hope to go on and earn my masters and perhaps my Ph.D. in theatre arts." 
A stranger visiting the ACC while an Irish basketball game is in progress most likely will hear a burst of cheering and applause followed by public address an­nouncer John Lloyd's exclamation of, "SLAM -DUNK!" The name of the player usually credited with that shot is Toby Knight. He talks about his "slam-dunk as well as his other contributions on the court. 
"I am partial to my jump shot from the base line," comments Knight. "I work hard on that shot and when it's going in I feel good and am motivated to play better." 
"Dunking the ball is really not a hard shot," he continues, "It really doesn't require much more than jumping. Still, I like to do it when I can because it's an exciting shot; it inspires the crowd and that in turn inspires the team." 
It is relatively easy for someone with even the barest amount of basketball knowledge to figure out that the team that controls the ball most of'the game more often than not will come out ahead on the scoreboard. The Irish lead the nation in out-rebounding their op­ponents by over 12 caroms a contest and a lot of the credit for that statistic must go to . Toby Knight. Rebounding, Knight be­lieves, is a skill that requires much practice and concentration. 
"Many people think that height or jumping ability is all that is necessary to be a good rebounder, but that isn't always true," ex­plains Knight. "The three things that I see as most important to good rebounding are having position on your man, boxing him out and being able to jump fairly well. If, for instance, you have jumping ability but you neglect to box your man out then you only have about a SO% -chance of getting the re­bound." 
"I try to get position, and my ability to do that is a large part of any success I might have grabbing rebounds," continues Knight. "A simple rule to remember concern­ing rebounding is, if you have position, box your man out and have jumping ability, then you have the ball." 
With Knight's college playing career drawing to a close, it's interesting to note what he regards as most memorable about his four years at Notre Dame. 
"As far as on the basketball court, the greatest thing that ever happened to me was the win at UCLA this season," the Irish for­ward revealed. "It wasn't so much anything particular that I did, it was just that we did it as a team and we did it on theri home court. Not many people can say that they were part of a team that defeated UCLA at Pauley Pavillion." 
Knight goes on: "As far as Notre Dame, itself, I have no regrets concerning my decision to come here. I received offers from many places like Boston College, Mary­land and Louisville, but a close friend of mine, Ron Goodman, came to Notre Dame on a football scholarship and he told me what a great place it was so I decided to take his advice, and it turned out to be good advice." 
After winning nine of their last ten games and making their first appearance in the UPI poll in over a month, the Irish, points out Knight, will most likely receive an NCAA playoff invitation and will represent Notre Dame well in the tournament. 
''If we play the type of basketball we've been playing the last nine of ten games, then I don't believe there's any question that we'll make the playoffs." A confident Knight stated. "As far as the actual playoff games, well, I don't 

Irish improve mark to 62 straight 
by Paul Stevenson Sports Writer 

The Notre Dame fencing team increased their winning streak to an incredible 62 as they tallied three additional victories this past weekend at the ACC. 
The Irish easily out-fenced the University of Illinois Circle Campus 20-7, Ohio State University 19-8 and Michgan State University 18-9 to continue their unbeaten string. 
Mike Sullivan performed in his usual style, going 6-0 in match play. The sophomore standout only has one loss for the season and is the leading sabre specialist : in victories. He is a probable can­didate to receive the chance to represent Notre Dame in the NCAA championships held here in late

March. 
Dualing for the Irish in foil are three fencers with very similar records. Tri-captain Terry McCon­ville sorked his way to a S-0 record over the weekend and has only five losses the entire season. 
Pat Garrard fenced his way to a 5-1 mark last Saturday and has a mere two losses thus far this year. Mike McCahey chalked up five additional bouts against no defeats this past weekend and has been downed only four times during the 1977 season. 
All three foil experts are in position to be able to display their talents at the NCAA's for Notre Dame. "It's a nice situation to be in for the NCAA championships, hav­ing three excellent starters whose records are within about two or

More Dreadful News 

======:::=:::====::======:==::;:;::=:=:=:===========:=:=:=:===========================:=:=====:======:=::=:=====:=:=:============== Joe Roth 
The newspapers Sunday were brimful of late-breaking sports stories. Michigan downed Minnesota, West Virginia upset Notre Dame. An o&scure longshot threatened to win the Los Angeles Open, and the Cincinnati Reds signed Joe Morgan, Ken Griffey, an<~ George Foster. But there was another news item that rendered these insignificant by comparison; in Berkeley, University of California quarterback Joe Roth died in his apartment after a long bout with cancer. He was twenty-one. 
News of Roth's death came scarcely six weeks after doctors had assured the standout passer that he was well on his way to recovery. A University of California Medical Center spokesman said simply that Roth had succumbed to ''a rare form of cancer.'' It was the same cancer that Roth had battled courageously off and on over the past two years, during which time the gallant blonde became the nation's premier signal-caller. 
Stunned teammates and friends gathered in Berkeley for today's funeral as a shocked sports world attempted to find some meaning, some source of solace, in Roth's death. Here at Notre Dame, student reaction reflected feelings of bewilderment and dismay. "It just doesn't make sense," commented one sophomore. No one argued. 
After finishing third in last year's Reisman Trophy ballotting, Roth was a certain first-round pro draft pick. His athletic prominence served to heighten the sense of injustice. "You can't understand it; I suppose you can only accept it," was the way another student summed up his sentiments. Death among sports figures is by no means uncommon. Roberto Clemente, Art Pollard, Steve Prefontaine--the list is endless. But more than a few distraught persons were having trouble on this Sunday accepting the untimely death of such a promising athlete. 
three bouts of one another,'' Head Coach Mike DeCicco commented. 
All three of the foil starters have at least 22 victories on the year, and whoever performs in behalf of Notre Dame at the NCAA's, the Irish will have a strong contender. 
Once again, Tri-captain Tim Glass is continuing his winning ways for the Irish in epee. Glass was S-1 in his performance last Saturday, falling to Brian Peterman of Michigan State, the Spartan's best epee specialist. 
Glass has only two losses this season, and like Sullivan is a probable Notre Dame representa­tive at the NCAA's as well as a contender for the gold medal. 
This weekend, the Irish put their 62-match winning streak on the line as they travel to Madison, Wiscon­sin to face the University of Minnesota, the University of Wis­consin and the University of Illin­ois. 
Wisconsin and Illinois should be a test for the Irish, as the two schools will be battling for the Big Ten championship. Pat Gerrard will be faced with the task of fencing against his brothers, who are on the foil team at.IIlinois.

ND tankers sink, 62-51 
by Judy Byrnes and 
Leigh Tunakan 
Sports Writers 

It was a record breaking day last Friday at the Rockne Pool as Northern Illinois defeated the No­tre Dame swim team, 62-51. There were eight meet records establish­ed including six by Northern Illin-. ois. These were highlighted by Northern Illinois swimmer Dave Clark's performances in the 1,000 yard freestyle with a time of 10:09.3 and the 200-yard breaststroke in 2:21.5. 
Notre Dame's Ed Fitzsimmons sparked the Irish by sweeping the sprint freestyle events. Fitzsim­mons, who has his eyes on the NCAA Championships, set a pool record in the SO yard freestyle. His time of 0:22.0 marks his best time in that event. The previous pool record as established by George Grathus in 1970, stood at 0:22.1. Fitzsimmons also won the 100-yard freestyle with a time of 0:49.2. 
Mark Chiles of Notre Dame also set a meet record in the 200-yard backstroke with a time of 2:04.7. This topped the old record by almost two seconds. 
Bob Ebel and Joe Caverly both displayed strong performances for the Irish by capturing the one-me­ter diving and three-meter diving respectively. 
The loss of the opening event, the 400-yard medley relay, by one second proved to be the deciding factor in the meet. "There were some bright spots in our perfor­mances today," remarked Irish Coach Dennis Stark. "We knew they were tough and they swam incredibly well today. But we had some good times, including Fitz­simmon's pool record. If you turn the one tenth-second around in the 400-medley rel<!Y· it might have been a different meet." In any case. the Notre Dame swimmers did achieve eight or nine of their best times of the season. 
On Saturday afternoon the Notre Dame swimmers met the Purdue Boilermakers and were defeated by a score of 77-46. Two meet records were broken by Purdue . one in the 200-yard backstroke by David Dowd with a time of 2:01.9. and the other by Fritz Schuma.m in the 1000 yard freestyle with a time of 
10:20.6. Dowd's time also broke the 
standing pool record of 2:02.1. Ed Fitzsimmons proved to be one of the consistantly strong Irish swimmers as he won both the SO­yard and 100-yard freestyle events. His times of 0:22.4 and 0:49.4 respectively were not as good as in Friday's meet, but agian were important for the Irish. The team of Ed Fitzsimmons, Scott Jussup, Matt Dalton and Tom Hartye captured the 400-yard freestyle relay with a.time of 3:18.8. 
Purdue's divers Scott Wiley and Bill Smith edged Notre Dame's Joe Caverly and Bob Ebel to capture the one-meter and three-meter events with 253.8 points and 273.8 points respectively. 
Stark realized that Purdue's team would be tough, and feels that the Irish swam well in a "losing effort." He said that it helps our program to swim against a nationally ranked team. 
The loss was the third straight for the Irish after winning three straight, and drops their season record to 3-6. 
Notre Dame has one dual meet remaining on their schedule before the Motor City Invitational in Detroit on March 3-5. Illinois State will oppose the Irish at the Rockne Memorial Pool on Friday afternoon at 4 p.m.
