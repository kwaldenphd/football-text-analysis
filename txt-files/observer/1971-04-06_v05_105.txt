In other major action yesterday, the SLC defeated by voice vote a motion by Barkett, seconded by Student Body Vice­President Orlando Rodriguez, to reduce the size of the SLC from the current membership of 24 to 12. 
This proposal was attacked by Kezele because he said it would not allow for a diversity of opinion, and there were better ways for improving the ef­fectiveness of the body.

plans to take a realistic look at the university's problems, and his commission "will play a large part in forging the 'new part­nership' between students and Student Government promised in 
the campaign." 

Fortunate will work in the areas of minority and in­ternational students, campus ministry, co-education, ad­missions and counselling. He feels that "both osvchological and career counselling must be changed in preparation for co­education." 
Under Fortunate the Human Affairs Commission will try to aid the hall governments and presidents and work in the minority student area, especially with the Black Studies Program. He will also try to improve the existing university programs and services, and make them more available to the average student. 
Fortunate emphasized the fact said that a monthly newsletter that "these services can't be containing the student union and accomplished without student university calendars, university efforts and co-operation on all directives, and other items of levels." interest would be sent to off­

new job. He feels that living off campus has acquainted him with the situation and life of the off-campus student. 
Drost said that his emphasis will be twofold. "We will try to improve the everyday life of the off-campus student, and we will strive to include the off-campus student in the activities of the university community." He plans a qualitative listing of available housing, and mentioned the possibility of a food co-op. Drost 
Academic Commissioner Fred Giuffrida was Lyons Hall senator this year, and was recently elected to his second year as a Stay Senator. He has also been a student representative to the Faculty Senate. 
Of his new position he says, "We are stressing student par­ticipation in decisions concerning academic life at Notre Dame, the improvement of counselling services throughout the

university, and implementation of the merger in the area of academics." Giuffrida will work for advances in such areas as Work-Study, Pass-Fail, a Junior Year at home program, and curriculum revision. 
He said, "We hope to aid the student directly by improving his academic program, offering him a greater voice and more freedom in his academic pur­suits." 
Dave Tushar, assistant co­ordinator for the Judicial Commission this past year, plans a four-pronged emphasis as Judicial Co-ordinator. 
The first area is the halls. "I want to work with them and be available for assistance. Secondly, I want to work on unifying the two (Notre ..Dame­Saint Mary's) judicial systems. Third, I want to be more available to students and work more closely with the RA's and rectors. Finally, I hope to in­crease the efficiency of the judicial process by working out procedural matters." 
Tushar sees the Judicial Commission as a service to the students. He feels that it should offer aid when difficulties arise, insure the rights of the students and increase the spirit and life of the university community.

Notre Dame book drive aids Indian college 
Notre Dame, Ind.--Students and friends of the University of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College were asked in January to contribute unused books to help stock the library of the newly founded Spotted Tail Junior College on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota. Members of the Committee on Indians at the University, who expected a contribution of two to three tons, are now preparing to move westward during the Easter vacation with a collection nearing seven tons and still growing. 
Dr. -A.L. Soens, associate professor of English and com­mittee chairman, said the "overwhelming response" to the plea for books is a "clear in­dication that the university community is concerned with advancement of educational opportunities for Indian youth." He added a special message of appreciation to the Herb Seall Marathon station, South Bend Avenue and Ironwood, for their free loan of a U-Haul truck to transport the books to the college. 
A preliminary gift of $500 from the Notre Dame Mardi Gras Charity Chest committee will be used to purchase bookshelves at the college and to pay for gasoline costs involved in transporting the collection. Committee members also plan to reproduce two rare volumes of Sitting Bull's works from the Niles, Mich., Museum for ad­dition to the collection on Indian lore.

* Unemployment stalks the campus. Students search frantically for ~ * 
any kind of part-time work, but there is no work. In fact, if things
*don't get better soon, many students may be forced into baby-sitting. *
* I hear you cry, "No! No!" But alas, my friends, desperate times *
* require desperate remedies. So if baby-sit we must, let us at least do it ** scientifically. * 
* 
To begin with, be sure you have the right equipment for the job *

* 
You will need three things: an ordinary kitchen chair, a whip, and a* pistol loaded with blank cartridges. * 
I 
It is essential to dominate the baby from the very start. Never* show fear; they can .smell it. Walk into the nursery boldly with your* head thrown back, singing a lusty song-LaMarseillaise, perhaps, or* A Boy Named Sue. Stomp around the room several times. Crack your* whip. Fire your pistol. Keep it up till the baby knows you mean busi-~ ness. 
But terror, though necessary, is not enough. To get the best re­sults out of a baby, you must also make it love and trust you. This, however, cannot be accomplished by firing your pistol, not even close* 
to th bby' "'. A nw tadk ;, "qui"d' ynu mwt giv it wm food.i

*
! 

The baby's habitual diet is a viscous white fluid called "formula.'' This should be served at the temperature of your wrist. In the event you can't find the baby's formula, let it suck your wrist. It will never know the difference, for the baby is basically an organism of dim intel­ligence, though not without a certain peasant cunning. 
I 
After the baby has ingested the formula or sucked your wrist for thirty minutes or so, it grows stuporous and is ready to go to sleep-the very thing you've been waiting for. You can hasten this desirable con­dition by singing a lullaby. If you don't know any lullabies, make one up. This is really quite simple. In a lullaby the words are unimportant since the baby, basically an organism of dim intelligence as we have 
I 
seen, does not understand them anyhow. It is the sound which matters in a lullaby, so use any old thing that comes into your head, just so it rhymes. For example, I have always had excellent luck with this one: 
Go to sleep, my little infant, Googoo, moomoo, poopoo, mnfant. * 
* ~ Next, arrange the baby in the position for slumber. A baby sleeps~* 
* best on its stomach but, owing to its dim intelligence, it will keep turn-* * ing itself over if not prevented. Therefore, to insure that it remains * 
I 
*prone, it is wise to place a soft, heavy object on its back-another* baby, if possible. * Once the baby is asleep, remove your wrist from its mouth and * tiptoe softly from the room, closing the door tightly behind you so you * * 
will not be disturbed by its crying. Then turn on the television, go to * the refrigerator and reward yourself for a job well done. Reward your-* self how? Surely you know ... with Miller High Life Beer, of course! * 
That is how honest workers like you have been rewarding them-* selves for over 115 years. And no wonder! What better reward than * Miller's amber liveliness? What higher bounty than Miller's lively * amberness? What pleasanter premium than Miller's breath-taking, * joy-making, soul-waking flavor? What welcomer bonus than that this Miller, this best of all possible beers, this jewel of the brewmaster's Iart, should be available both in beautiful bottles of clear glass and in cans which are equally winsome, though opaque? 
So sit back and enjoy the Miller you have so richly earned. And remember this when it comes to baby-sitting: a good big man can * 
always lick a good little ;ne. * * I 
We, the brewers of Miller High Life Beer, who bring you this column

Holy Cross fights chapel locking 
by John Powers Apparent stealing in the Holy Cross hall chapel and related incidents have led to the locking of the chapel doors by Rev. Thomas Seidel, C.S.C., rector of Holy Cross. Seidel refused to disclose the circumstances, stating only that "The chapel is open for Mass." The chapel was locked last Tuesday because of the stealing of altar wine. Also stolen since the beginning of the year are a gold candlebra, an American flag and pole, and candles. One hall resident, who asked that his name be withheld, said that the wine was stolen by townies. David Tokarz, Hall Liturgical Commissioner, said that some wine and candles had been stolen earlier in the year. "I'm not aware of any wine that is missing," he said, "not in the course of the last two months." One student reportedly saw smoke in the chapel on a few mornings this year, but the cause 
of these incidents was un­
determined. The locking of the chapel was

THE OBSERf!M_____ _ 
tim kendall 



Nothing, we are told, is quite so weak as an idea whose time is past. It occurs to me with increasing frequency that in the minds of many, draft resistance, i.e., the total refusal to co-operate wit;h the SSS, is and of right ought to be a thing of the past (if it ever had a rightful place at all). One is not quite certain how one ought to un­derstand this, for the same conditions which led to the Resistance Movement's original rise are still prevalent (and less tolerable by the mere fact that they have continued to endure). 
It is still the case, for example, that the United States Government, in all our names, is "de-escalating" the war all over Southeast Asia. Itis still the case that most Americans believe that they are not being told the truth about the war by the Ad­ministration. But apolemicagainst the war itself is not my purpose here. The last ten years speak far more eloguently in that regard, to anyone who cares to listen, than I could ever hope to. The draft still con­tinues, and its inequities persist despite the vaunted lottery system. 
It is often objected that one owes it to one's government to obey the law wherever possible. Resistance, it is said, is subversive of the very foundations of government, law, and order. If one must oppose war, the argument concludes, one should apply for a Conscientious Objector status. 
It rather seems, however, that history shows us enough Hiroshimas, Dresdens, Buchenwalds, and My Lais to support the claim that the mere fact of a government's commanding some act or course of action does not necessarily imply that the act or course of action is morally right. Govern­ments are made of men, and men are fallible at best. Thus, governments can and sometimes do command their subjects to commit the most horrible outrages against other human beings. I would submit, with the Nuremburg judges, that it is one's duty to human kind to carefully evaluate the commands of government before granting them unqualified obedience, particularly when the govern­ment is being accused by many of crimes against humanity. 
Modern warfare, as one can discern from its methods and its results, is the most prominent example of a crime against humanity commanded by a government of its people. To put the matter in its mildest form, unjust killing occurs in any war. Unjust killing is murder. To contribute in any way to war is to contribute in that way to murder. The effect of the draft is to compel men, under threat of prison, fine, and disgrace, to participate in murder. 
As an aside, it occurs to one at this point 
that the only difference between 
Lieutenant Calley and many, many others 
is that Calley was unfortunate enough to 
get publicity. Civilians are equally dead 
whether they are killed by rifles at point­
blank range, by anti-personnel bombs 
dropped on villages suspected of harboring 
Viet Cong (My Lai was so suspected),· or 
by starvation due to the ruination of land 
by chemical defoliants. Why was Calley 
tried, when no bomber-pilots have been 
tried? As Chuck Darst pointed out at the 
Moratorium Day Rally of 15 October 1969, 
to raise the issue of individual atrocities in 
Indochina is really to miss the point: the 
whole war, by its very nature, is one grand 
atrocity. 
No one, at this point in hil?tory, can hope for military success if he .is unwilling b~ commit atrocities. One of the tragedies of a trial like Calley's is that it focuses public attention in the wrong place. It makes people think that only certain perverted individuals ever commit "war crimes" What is obscured is that fact that this government has taken a man, trained him to kill, filled his mind with notions of all Southeast Asians as Communist enemies, and set him to work. When he functions as trained, and happens to receive publicity, the government seeks to shift the blame to him. 
The suggestion that anti-war peo,Ple who are subject to the draft should apply for 
C.O. status raises first the broader question of deferments and exemptions in general, objections to which are several. In the first place, to accept a deferment or an exemption oftne implies at least tacit endorsement of the SSS ("It's alright as long as it doesn't affect me.). In the second place, deferments such as II-A (oc­cupational), 11-C (agricultural), and 11-8 (student) are devices of "channelling", to use General Hershey's term, which ac­complish in this "free society" what a more direct type of coercion accomplishes in totalitarian countries: the directing of people's lives into areas and activities deemed worthwhile by the government. A worker in a munitions plant might be deferred, for example, while a theology grad student would be drafted. 
In the third place, deferments such as IV-B (government official), IV-D 
(ministerial) and I-0 (Conscientious Monday). On Good Friday, 9 April1971, at 
Objector) can be seen in many ways as privileges for the few rather than than as opportunities for the many. It is with the last of these classifications, I-0, that I am mainly concerned here. 
As everyone is by now aware, the Supreme Court has ruled that a man cannot be granted a 1-0 on the basis of objection to a particular war. This means that non-pacifists who believe that the war in Indochina is unjust and immoral must choose to violate their consciences, go to prison, go into hiding, or leave the country. How ironic that those who value the government highly enough to fight in defense of this country if it were attacked are precisely those whom the government forces to violate either their consciences or the law! 
But even for pacifists, the situation does 
not leave one morally comfortable. As 
many C.O.'s will admit, one's being 
granted the status of 1-0 depends upon a 
great many factors which have little or 
nothing to do with one's beliefs or sin­
cerity. The matter lies not so much in 
being sincere as in convincing the draft 
board that one is sincere. The two are not 
quite the same. For one thing, different 
draft boards have different whims. All of 
us have heard, at one time or another, 
about draft boards which have never 
granted a C.O. For another thing, the 
ability to convince a draft board of one's 
sincerity (unless one is a member of a 
particular tradition) and advise others 
to do the same, he should oppose it in a way 
open to all, regardless of their education or 
other social privileges. The only form such 
opposition can take is that of resistance. It 
is equally open to the pacifist and the 
Selective C.O., the educated and the 
uneducated, the rich and the poor. All it 
takes is the conviction that a jail sentence 
might be preferable to co-operation with, 
or co-optation by, a system which has as 
its business the destruction of human 
beings. 

This is not to say that there are no valid 
reasons for choosing legal conscientious 
objection over resistance. It depends upon 
individual circumstances. One might, for 
example, truly feel that he has talents 
which would enable him to be of significant 
help to others if he stays out of jail. This is 
undoubtedly true in many cases. But it is 
also true that it is very easy to rationalize 
and deceive oneself in this regard. Before 
co-operating with SSS, it seems to me, one 
should be rigorously honest with himself 
about his motives. 

Another objection to draft resistance 
recognizes all of the above, but maintains 
that it is, in the long run, useless. "The 
ideals you speak of are fine," the 
argument runs, "but in the last analysis 
people will not be moved. Go to prison, 
make your sacrifices, and the war will go 
right on as if nothing had happened. 
People, by and large, will do exactly what 
is comfortable and profitable for them. If 
this includes destruction and murder, then -that's the way it is. Why spend long years of your short life in prison for nothing_? You know that evil is occurring; just don't let it 
happen to you or by you." 
This line of thought is tempting indeed. 
All of us want to have the assurance that 
our efforts will be worthwhile, and if there · 
is no way of having that assurance, we are 
tempted to stop trying. One thought con­
stantly recurring to draft resisters is that 
to resist is to foolishly, uselessly, and 
mellodramatically "seek martyrdom." So 
strong and confusing is the uncertainty in 
this matter that one is often unable to be 
certain of his own motives. 
In the end, motivation becomes a matter 
of faith: faith in the belief that violence 
against other human beings is to be 
resisted, faith that love between human 
beings is possible, faith in the desire of 
offering to share our lives with others. And 
perhaps the worth of the offer depends not 
so much upon its being accepted as upon 
our making it in honesty and humility. 
As I write this, there sits on my desk an 
order, addressed to me by Local Board no. 
55 of Richmond, Virginia, to report for 
induction into the Armed Forces of the 
United States on 12 April 1971 (Easter 
12:00 noon, accompanied by the dual feeling of faith and uncertainty of which I speak, I shall bring the order to the area in front of the Administration Building of the 

,. 

Theology today needs to focus carefully upon the crucial problem of violence. The com­mandment "Thou shalt not kill" is morel than a mere matter of academic or sentimental interest in an age when man not only is more frustrated, more crowded, more subject to psychotic and hostile delusion than ever, but also has at his disposition an arsenal of weapons that make global suicide an easy possibility ... the population of the affluent world is nourished on a steady diet of brutal mythology and hallucination, kept at a constant pitch of high tension by a life that is intrinsically violent in that it forces a large part of the population to submit to an existence which is humanly in­tolerable... the problem of violence, then, is not the problem of a few rioters and rebels, but the problem of a whole social structure which is outwardly ordered and respectable, and inwardly ridden by psychopathic obsessions and delusions. 
"Love" is unfortunately a much misused word. It trips easily off the Christian tongue-so easily that one gets the im­pression it means others ought to love us for standing on their necks. 
The theology of love must seek to deal realistically with the evil and injustice in the world, and not merely to compromise with them. Such a theology will have to take note of the ambiguous realities of politics, without embracing the specious myth of "realism" that merely justifies force in the service of established power. Theology does not exist merely to appease the already too untroubled conscience of the powerful and the established. A theology of love may also con­ceivably turn out to be a theology of revolution. In any case, it is a theology of resistance, a refusal of the evil that reduces a brother to homicidal desperation. 
-Thomas Merton in Faith and 
Violence University of Notre Dame. There, for what it is worth, and before any witnesses who care to watch, I shall, mindful of the consequences and with charity aforethought, read the order aloud and then destroy it. The act will be one of solidarity with all those who have suffered and died in this war, and with all those who have gone to prison in protest over this war. 

Finally, a word about responsibility. On their album Monster, Steppenwolf has recorded a song called "Draft Resister" in which the following lines occur: 
Don't forget the draft resisters 
in their sad and lonely plea 
when they march them off to prison 
they will go for you and me 
Nothing could be further from the truth. In the game of life, no one "&oes" or "does" for anyone else. Each person has his own vision, his own responsibility, and each must "go" in his own place, answer to his own God. We can look to others for in­spiration, for ideas, and for examples, buf ­we cannot look to them for courage, and they cannot fill our hearts with love. For the courage to love, each person must look to his own soul.

Chilean vote 

SANTIAGO, CHILE UPI Chile's Marxist oriented government parties ld by President Salvador Allende's Socialists came within a hair of capturing 50 percent of the vote in nationwide municipal elections, final returns showed yesterday. 
Political analysts agreed the strong showing of the govern­ment now gives Allende a priority to move ahead quickly with his sweeping nationalization and 
redical  agrarian  reform  
programs.  
The  government  parties  

received an impressive 49.73 per cent of the 2,823,884 votes cast and emerged with a 1.69 per cent lead over the combined op­postioon. 
Results were released shortly after noon 1 p.m. EST by the Interior Ministry. 
An hour later, however, the same ministry issued new figures which omitted the independent, blank and voided votes. Under this new calculation, the government claimed it had in­deed captured 50.86 of the vote. 
It said the opposition had won 
49.14 per cent of the vote. 

Thus, the election returns and the outcome depended on what set of figures were considered acceptable. 
But either way the government parties' showing was impressive. 
Their demonstration of collective "political punch" at the polls gave Allende's domestic prestige a powerful boost, after only five months in office.
