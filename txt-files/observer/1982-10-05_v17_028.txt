Technicians in Chicago have so far found no cyanide in empty capsules and powder found in a parking lot a day before the first of seven victims died from poisoned Extra-Strength Tylenol, the state attorney general said last night. Meanwhile, about 1,300 volunteers fanned out through the city yesterday to warn the lonely and elderly who may not have heard about the deadly capsules placed in several stores in the Chicago area last week. Offi­cials of various governmental agencies sought measures to prevent future tampering with over-the-counter drugs. In the Chicago area, the Cook County Board approved an ordinance requiring such drugs be sealed before they are sold. In Washington, the Food and Drug Administration announced that drug manufacturers were setting up a task force to seek new safeguards. -AP 
About 1,300 volunteers fanned o~t through the city yesterday to warn the lonely and elderly who may not have heard about cyanide in Extra-Strength Tylenol. Government offi­cials, meanwhile, sought measures to prevent future tampering with over-the-counter drugs. Authorities reported no significant progress in the hunt for the random killer who claimed seven victims by placing deadly capsules on several different stores in the Chicago area last week. On Sunday, state Attorney General Tyrone Fahner said investigators t were looking at more than two dozen suspects who included "malcontents ...and weirdos who don't act right or did something extremely out of the ordinary." He said investigators believe one person acted alone, filling the capsules at home and then

Canadian pianist Glenn Gould, one of the 
foremost performers of the keyboard works of Johann Sebastian Bach and the musical world's most celebrated eccentric, is dead at the age of 50. Gould, who retired from the concert stage when he was 31 but continued to make best-selling recordings, suffered a stroke on Sept. 27, two days after his 50th birthday. He died yester­day at Toronto General Hospital without regaining consciousness, his family said. Ray Roberts, Gould's longtime associate, said he had not been ill before the stroke. The funeral service will be private, and a memorial service will be held later, the family announced. Born in Toronto, Gould demonstrated perfect pitch and could read music at the age ofthree. He graduated from the Royal Conservatory ofMusic in Toronto at the age of 12 -the youngest graduate in the school's history -and made his debut with the Toronto Symphony at 14. He played his first successful U.S. recitals in Washington, D.C., and New York in January 1955, when he was 22. -AP 
President-elect Miguel de Ia Madrid denies that Mexico is going socialist and says he will work for continued good relations with the United States. De Ia Madrid, who succeeds Presi­dent Jose Lopez Portillo Dec. 1, said in a TV interview broadcast Sunday that despite his predecessor's nationalization of Mexico's private banks on Sept. 1, "it is not, nor can it be the intention of the Mexican government to lead the country to a process of socializa­tion." "My commitment is to the Mexican Revolution and not to socialism," he said. The takeover of the banks and enterprises they control increased the government's share of the business and in­dustrial output to about 80 percent, according to unofficial es­timates. But de Ia Madrid said "private enterprise continues to have vast areas to develop its initiatives in," and the "mixed economy" in which the government and private enterprise function jointly "is still in effect." -AP

I like the dining hall 
It is always easier to malign than praise. In fact if we humans couldn't malign, complain, moan, or groan, we would be in real trouble. A large portion ofour days are devoted to uttering and hearing phrases like this: "This weather sucks (this is heard rain or shine)!" "My roommate is a bonehead," "People are icky," "My girl/boyfriend is a jerk!", "My classes are boring," "I'm failing!", "South Bend is a hole," and the list goes on and on with an array ofgloom and doom. 
But one topic overshadows even the most tragic of these laments: the dining hall. Each day persons here find something about their dining experience worth complaining about. Entire conversations involving numerous tablemates have been based on the sogginess of the broccoli or just what the casserole is composed of. 
Is the amount of abuse the dining hall receives jus­tified? I don't think so. In fact, I look forward to my daily treks to either the north or south facilities. Am I out of my mind you ask? Have I eaten one too many cream­filled long johns? I don't think so. The dining halls have several points in their favor. 
First ofall, let me get to the stomach ofthe matter ­

the food. I don't see how anyone can find fault with the 
selection. As a child I nor­to meet up with friends. mally enjoyed yummy and During my first two years nutritious meals fixed by my here, a friend and I ate at the mother.

I also enjoyed the even the most finely subtle differences of Saint prepared items. When you Mary's dining, the soft serve 
are cooking up a few hundred pounds of green beans, they can't always come out finely sauteed. I remember touring th<; kitchens of the North Dining Hall a few years ago; it's hard to express the feelings I felt inside as I gazed upon a steaming mountain of meatloaf. The meatloaf itself is a good example ofthe food. It is rather bland, but with some ketchup sloshed on, it can move through your system with minimal distress. 
Occasionally the dining hall surpasses itself. Last Thursday was the acclaimed "South of the Border" night. I will admit to beinga bit wary ofthe whole event. At home in California, the preparation of Mexican food is a statewide pastime. I grew up eating the products of the Tampico Restaurant in downtown Santa Cruz. The food there was stuff I dreamed ofduring those long days between trips home. And since some of the Tampico's finest cooks are each week deported, I doubted that the dining halls here inindiana, could do justice to a tortil­la. Happily I was wrong. With some help from an outside supplier, the dining hall staff did a credible job. I was greeted by decent renditions of many popular

dishes; there were nachos and best ofall, vats ofgenuine guacamole. The screams of demented mariachis could even be heard over the sound system. 
The food service powers that be should feel proud of the job they did for the students. They didn't have to do it, but they did. Most ofthe employees do make an effort to do their best. Often times, I have gotten that extra dose ofgravy, or that center piece ofpizza by displaying a winning smile, and remembering my manners (the kind I learned by politely eating liver at my sister's). This year the workers are even sporting those "lettuce 
serve you" buttons. Who could question this kind of spirit? Through the years, going to eat has been somewhat of an escape from the routine ofschool. It can be a chance 
ice cream, the always available cereal, and a certain am­biance not found in the middle ofthe South Dining Hall mobs. These were not meals of nutrition, but meals of pleasure. (Although I did not like the chairs, which are dangerous to people ofreduced coordination.) 
Even now, as I live off-campus, I still have a partial meal plan. One oflife's pleasures is sitting by a window at the North Dining Hall, sipping coffee, and reading the newspaper (The Observer, of course). I also am not home too often, so the convenience ofa meal plan is all that stands between myself and sure starvation. It is enjoyable to hear some of my off-campus brethren express their joy at being away from the dining halls, and then observe t the mysterious brews and simmering goos they prepare for themselves. 
So the next time you are tempted to base your mealtime conversation on a cutdown of your vittles, remember, you are what you eat.

Falkland Islands 
Thatcher Cabinet tnetnber speaks 

ByTOMPACE 
News Staff 
"Why did we risk lives to defend small, remote and sparsely pop· ulated islands? The answer is a simple one. To uphold a principle," stated the Right Honorable Sally Op­penheim -cabinet member for Margaret Thatcher -at a lecture last night in the Library Auditorium. 
Commenting on the Falkland Is­land situation. Oppenheim con­tinued to say that Great Britain wished "to demonstrate that aggres­sion does not pay." If that demonstration proved to set a precedent against military aggres­sion. she said, "then that war. the loss of those lives, and the salvation of that principle which were ere al­ready worthwhile, will have been made a hundred percent more worthwhile." 
In discussing the precursors to the actual battles, the speaker stressed that " the mood of the house called for nothing less than the dispatch ofa large task force." 
Apparently, this was also the 
mood of a majority of the people of 

$7 000 Mellon fellowships available to seniors, grads 
ByPATSAIN 
News Staff 
New fellowships called Mellon fellowships -worth !\7,000 and graduate school tuition are available this year to seniors and recent graduates planning careers as humanities professors. These fellow­ships are sponsored by the Woodrow Wilson Foundation. 
Candidacy for the Mellon Fellow· ship requires nomination by a faculty member, which must be sub­mitted no later than Nov. 5, accord· ing to Notre Dame professor Walter Nicgorski, who serves as campus representative for the fellow~ ....ps. 
''Without the encouragement of fellowships, in the face of an ap­parent depressing job market for college teachers, very talented un­dergraduates are being attracted to other fields," Nicgorski said last week. "The Mellon Fellowships are a tangible way to induce people to go into teaching." 
Between 100 and 125 of the renewable fellowships will be awarded nationwide. No more than 10 will be given at any one univer­sity. 
The fellowships are open to fields in the traditional humanities, includ­ing history and American Studies. The performing arts, however, are excluded. 
"Studies indicate that in the 1990's, there will be a need for ex­cellent teachers in the humanities," Nicgorski said. "The danger isn't that there will not be a lot of teachers, but that the best minds will not be in the teaching field." The Mellon Fellowships are similar to those given for several years by the Dan­forth Foundation. These were pres­tigious fellowships which paid for graduate study at the master's de­gree level, and were for anyone who wanted to enter college teaching. 
"The Danforth Fellowships were 
for those who saw an ultimate and 
religious value in teaching," said 
Nicgorski, who was the campus rep· 
resentative for the fellowships for 
five years. Notre Dame had an excel· 
lent record in getting the Danforth 
fellowships, with t1ve or six t1nalists 
and one or two winners a year. 
The Mellon Fellowships are also 
similar to the Woodrow Wilson Fel­
lowships, which were given at the 
same time as the Danforth Fellow­
ships. "A number of our faculty are 
Woodrow Wilson fellows," said Nic· 
gorski. 

Student Senate urges lights on b-ball courts 
By MICHAEL L. BRENNAN 
News Staff 
Imagine it -playing Bookstore Basketball "under the lights" on Stepan courts. 
The installatio:1 of lights on some of the University_, outdoor basket­hall and tennis courts was proposed last night by the Student Senate. 
In a letter today to Student Affairs Vice-President Father John Van Wolvlear, the Senate requested he consider the feasibility of installing permanent lighting for the Stepan and Lyons basketball courts, and four of the Courtney tennis courts. 
The letter suggests lights as a 
means of alleviating the nighttime 
overcrowding at the University's in­
door facilities. namely the Rockne 
Memorial, Stepan Center. and the 
ACC. 
Recognizing the expense of in­
stalling outdoor lights, and realizing 
that the television networks will not 
be as anxious to foot this bill as they 
were for the night game, the Senate 
further proposed that the basketball 
courts could be flooded and used as 
ice rinks during the winter. Thus, 
the lights could be used year-round. 
Special Projects Commissioner Rob Bertino researched the over­crowding of the indoor facilities, and suggested the outdoor lighting as a possible solution. Bertino noted that an average of 100 students per weeknight are using "The Rock", and nighttime use of the Stepan 
courts is reserved for various halls and clubs. 
This leaves only the ACC courts available. Director of Non-Varsity Athletics Dr. Tom Kelly said, "We could have 5 more courts (in the ACC) and they would still be t11Jed." 
It is no secret that Notre Dame has 
more than its fair share of basketball 
fanatics, who will play anytime, 
anywhere -as evidenced by some 
of last year's Bookstore Basketball 
games that were played in sub-artie 
conditions. The Senate feels that 
lights installed on the Stepan and 
Lyons courts would be put to good 
use, especially during the annual 
Bookstore Tourament. 
Furthermore, using the courts as 
ice rinks during the South Bend win­
ters would mean close to H more 
months ofuse for the lights annually. 
.The Senate would also like to have four of the outdoor tennis courts lighted, as there are presently only three courts available for night play. Even those three courts cannot be reserved, nor are they available during hockey games (the bleachers overlap onto the courts). These Senate proposals for outdoor lights are in their infancy, though. While the Senate feels the proposal is a good idea, there will be many obstacles to be hurdled before stu­dents can go skating behind Lyons Hall at midnight. 
Student Body President Lloyd Burke will meet with Father Van Wolvlear sometime this week to get his reactions on the feasability ofthe Senate proposals. 
Great Britain, according to Oppen­heim, because "the real and overrid· ing power lies where it should lie in any democracy -with the people, through their democratically elected Parliament. 
In answer to the question -"Can Maggie hold On ?" -Oppenheim asserted that the opinion polls were in the Prime Minister's favor before the Falkland incident arose, and that those polls should continue to favor Mrs. Thatcher after all of the back­wash from the incident is gone. 
The rest of the address centered on the power structure of the government in Great Britain. Op­penheim was quick to point out that the major difference between the governments of Great Britain and the United States lies in the selection ofcabinet members. 
Members of the Prime Minister's. cabinet are elected, rather than ap­pointed, as is the case in the United States. Also, those people who are elected to the Prime Minister's cabinet must be members of politi­cal parties. They cannot be involved in private industry. This gives Great Britain a much more powerful cen­ter ofgovernment. 
Oppenheim rounded out her address by reiterating that the power in her country's government may be diffused through the system, but the real power lies in Parliament.

ly released weather outlook from 
the National Weather Service for t October to December, 1982. This ninety-day forecast predicts that the "probability of relatively cold weather is 55 percent or better from the Northern and Central Great Plains eastward through the Great lakes and the Ohio and Ten· nessee valleys." Translated into non­metereologist language, this statement means that the 55 percent chance of relatively cold weather is fairly insignificant. "We will probably have normal or slightly below normal temperatures for this pe.riod of the year," stated WNDU metereologist Bob Werner. According to Werner, although winter looks more favorable, the forecast does not extend to the post· December weather, which.is usually the coldest time ofthe year. As for the question of possible preparations being made by the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's Ad· ministration offices for snow days, both colleges do not have any set plans. Leo. M. Corbaci, Dean of Ad­ministration, .stated that when a snow day is to be declared, the deci­sion usually either comes from Uni·

On Sunday, six Israeli soldiers were killed and 22 wounded by automatic weapons and bazooka fire in an ambush of their bus at Aley, about I 0 miles southeast of Beirut and near Syrian lines.

Hartzler vs. Black 
Nuclear freeze necessity argued 
By TONI RUTHERFORD 
StaffReporter 
The necessity of a nuclear freeze was the topic ofconcern in a debate last ni~t at Carroll Hall, Saint Mary's College. 
Dr. Craig Hartzler of Saint Mary's Government Department argued in favor of a nuclear freeze, while Dr. Tony Black of Saint Mary's History Department, argued against such a proposal. 
Hartzler stressed the need for a mutual global nuclear freeze. He felt that this is a time unlike any in the human past, stating that nuclear warfare is an "ecological peril, not just a human peril." 
Living in constant fear ofa nuclear 
blast causes what psychiatrists call 
"psychic numbing", according to 
Hartzler. The threat of destruction 
Reagan blames Demos for unemployment woes 
COLUMBUS, Oh. (AP) -Presi­
dent Reagan, on the campaign trail 
again, declared yesterday that infla­
tion is the cause of today's near 
record unemployment and -once 
again -he blamed it all on his 
Democratic predecessors. 
He also suggested that the nuclear freeze movement is being manip­ulated by people who want to weaken the United States. 
The president said his comments were sparked by the appearance of several hundred demonstrators where he spoke at a meeting or­ganized by five veterans' groups. 
"They were demonstrating on the behalfofa movement that has swept across our country -inspired by not the sincere, honest people who want peace, but by some who want a weakening of America, and so are 
manipulating many honest and sin­
cere people," he said. 
In the prepared portion of his 
speech. Reagan gave various reasons 
for the present joblessness, but "in 
my own view the cause is one and 
one only: inflation." 
Most economists would argue 
that nsmg unemployment has 
resulted, not from inflation itself, but 
from government policies designed 
to fight inflation by slowing 
economic growth. 
Reagan's new chief White House 
economist, MartinS. Feldstein, made 
that point at his Senate contlrmation 
hearing Sept. 22, when he said those 
"who predicted trat inflation would 
he reduced WltllQUt raising un­
employment ha\ ~.: been decisively 
proven wrong 
Since 1979, unemployment has 
been rising while inflation has been 
falling. Inflation, as measured by the 
Consumer Price Index, has receded 
from 13.3 percent in 1979 to 12.4 
percent in 1980, 8. 9 percent in 1981 
and an expected 5 percent to 6 per­
cent this year. 
Average unemployment, on the 
other hand. has been climbing ­

from 5.8 percent in 1979 to 7.1 per­

· cent in 1980, 7.6 percent in 1981 and an estimated 9. 5 percent this year. Reagan said his administration has "brought inflation down, and inter­est rates are following." He did not say why unemploy­ment remains high -it was 9.8 percent in August -but has said in the past that unemployment figures are the last to improve when an economy comes out ofrecession. Reagan was on a campaign trip for two Republicans who are trailing their Democratic opponents in Ohio's gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races. Reagan told the veterans, ''I'm not here today to campaign," but he made a pitch anyway for Rep. Clarence "Bud" Brown, R-Ohio, who is running for governor against Democrat Richard Celeste. Reagan said Brown has been "an invaluable ally in the fight against big government in Washington." 
Regina Hall election

wtnners 
Colleen Ambrose and Beth Steber were elected president and vice­president of Regina North Hall in a runoff election. 
Seventy percent of Regina North residents voted. Ambrose and Steber faced Karen Brady and Kathi Hartweger in the runoff. 
Last Thursday, residents elected Julie Harmon as secretary and Louise Berezny as treasurer. Voter turnout was 80 percent for that elec­tion. 
also lessens the number oflong-term human relationships. Hartzler believed that a nuclear freeze would "stop the arms race before the arms race stops the human race." 
Black warned that a nuclear freeze may actually bring about a nuclear war. He felt that the Soviet Union has proven that it cannot be trusted. He started his presentation with a strong history of the Soviet's treac­hery. 
Black contended that the United States position should be to "checkmate the enemy" rather than offer · them the opportunity to surpass us in arms by secret produc­tion throughout the freeze. 
Money was also an issue to Black. He felt that the money saved by ceasing production of nuclear arms would be spent on building up the United States conventional weaponry. This contradicts the

theory offered by supporters of a freeze, who claim that government spending will he lessened during a freeze. 
Hartzler held that, although the record of the Soviet Union should make us cautious, their suggestion of a reduction should make us more willing to trust them. If the Soviet would be unwilling to sign an agree­ment, then it would be ridiculous for the United States to do so, according to Hartzler. We, however, should try 
to work with them ifpossible. 
Hartzler warned that the S.A.L.T. 
treaties and the S.T.A.R.T. program 
allow for the making of some 
weapons, thus defeating the purpose 
of the freeze. He cited that it was, in 
fact, Reagan himself who called the 
S.A.L.T. treaties "fatally flawed." 
Black compared nuclear warfare to chemical warfare, which waS never used due to a balance of fear. Because nuclear warfare is such a terrible weapon, Black contended, it will not be used as long as no country has an obvious strength

Economic Update 
The Indiana general fund's revenue shortfall still is about S70 million for the fiscal year that beganJuly 1, despite September revenues that were close to expectations, the state's budget director says. Judith Palmer says she is estimating the fiscal­year-to-date revenue shortfall in the state's property tax replace­ment fund at n 5 million to S20 million. Miss Palmer says it's too early to predict what must be done to balance those 1982-83 budgets ifthe shortfall continues. "Until we have a few more months of revenues, it would be premature to make any determination as to 
what action will be necessary for the remainder of the fiscal year," she said. -AP

Picturing Hinckley's brajn 
ByKEVIN McKEAN 
Discover News Service 
In the crowded Washington, D.C., courtroom where John Hinckley Jr. sat at the defense table, Dr. Marjorie LeMay, a radiologist from Harvard, gesrured with a pointer at a screen on which was projected an image of Hinckley's brain. 
Speaking in a barely audible voice, LeMay described features of the brain that in an earlier report she had called strikingly abnormal. Those features, other witnesses would tell the jury, might be linked to schizophrenia. 
LeMay's testimony and that of other defense experts in June ap­parently set a legal precedent: Never before, the trial lawyers believed, had CT (computed tomography, or computer-enhanced X-ray) scans of a defendant's brain been used to sup­port a claim ofinsanity. 
Whether or not it was the CT scans that swayed them, the jurors evidently agreed with the defense. They found Hinckley not guilty by reason ofinsanity. 
At the same time, the testimony has focused attention on an impor­tant scientific debate over the sig­nificance, if any, of structural abnormalities in the brains of schizophrenics -people who suffer from disordered thinking, an ap­parant lack of emotion and bizarre (and, on rare occasions, violent) be­havior. 
The psychiatrists and neurologists who ordered a CT scan of John Hinckley after the assassination at­tempt were not looking for evidence of schizophrenia. They were check­ing for a brain tumor, stroke, infec­tion, or other physical defect that might have influenced his behavior. 
The first set of scans, taken at Duke University in April 1981, showed no gross irregularity. A Duke radiologis t t, Dr. Ralph Heinz, pronounced them normal. A few days later, Heinz filed an amended report saying than Hinckley's brain was probably normal but that there was a slight enlargement ofthe sulci, or creases, or its surface. 
These sulci are the convoluted folds that indent the cerebral cortex, the outer shell ofthe brain that is the seat of language, musical ability, 
critical  thought  and  other  higher  
functions.  
Other  radiologists  who  viewed  


the Hinckley scans thought the sulci appeared normal or only slightly en­larged. But LeMay and Harvard psyc­hiatrist David Bear, both of whom later testified for the defense, m t easured the sulci and concluded that they were markedly abnormaL Says Bear, It looked as if a worm had 
eaten away at the brain. 
LeMay thought the scans also 
showed a slight enlargement of the 
third ventricle, one ofthe fluid-filled 
chambers inside the brain. This was 
significant because a widened 
ventricle can indicate atrophy, or there was a 50 percent chance that a patient was suffering from schizophrenia instead of some mid­ler disorder, then finding widened sulci would -by mathematical reasoning based on Weinberger's es­timate -raise the probability of schizophrenia to 83 percent. 
If the CT scan remains an imper­fect tool for studying mental condi­tions, a more promising technology is being developed: the PETT (positron emiSSIOn transaxial tomography) scanner. Unlike the CT scanner, which reveals brain 

A positron emission transaxial tomography ( PEIT) scan image -this one ofa normal brain -records the actual metabolism of the brain.

Even­tually PETT may be allowed inside the courtroom to help jurors decide whether or not a defendant is truly insane (DISCOVER photo by Wayne Sorce). ,.. 
shrinkage, of the brain's core. 
A number of other researchers have found widened ventricles in schizophrenics. One of them, Dr. Daniel Weinberger, at the National Institute of Mental Health, dis­covered that the schizophrenics he studied also had a higher than nor­mal rate ofwidened sulci, Hinckley's main abnormality. 
Little wonder, then, that Weinber­ger was among those called to testify for the defense. Weinberger es­timates that prematurely widened sulci occur in about 1 5 percent of schizophrenics, compared with only 2 percent to 3 percent of other people. 
Weinberger emphasizes that aCT scan by itself could never prove schizophrenia. The reason, he says, is that there is nothing specific about these CT findings. It's like looking at a shadow on a chest X-ray. It doesn't mean its pneumonia -it could be a million other things. But Bear thinks the test could still be useful. 
He says that if a doctor thought anatomy, PETT records the actual metabolism of the brain. Doctors using this technique inject a mildly radioactive, sugarlike substance into the blood stream and then make the scan. 
PETT measures the radioactive emissions from the brain and produces an image showing which regions are metabolizing the most sugar (in other words, which are the most active). 
In a st1,1dy at Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, Alfred Wolf and Tibor Farkas have made PETT scans of more than 60 mental patients -including people with schizophrenia, paranoia, depression and manic depression. Each disor­der apparently affects the function­ing of the brain in a different way. According to Farkas, the lab has es­tablished a distinct pattern for each of the diseases. 
Defense attorneys say they 
rejected the idea of a PETT scan for 
Hinckley because the technology is 
too experimental.

When black and.White ~-~rn grey 
When I first thought about writing this ar­ticle, it was going to be one ofthose righteous, fiery pieces about Administration oppression of students and the injustices we endure. Un­fortunately, as I started looking behind the ap­pearances and sifting through the emotional hype, the nice clean lines started getting fuz­zy, and the black and white got greyer and greyer. As is usually the case, there was no easy answer. 
Robert Wack 
Both Sides 
The situation I'm referring to is the recent rash of mail from Dean Roemer to off-campus students. Ev.ery apartment at Campus View has received a letter advising moderation as to the extent of future social activities there. Several houses have received letters and have 
been subjected to the infamous directives ot the Dean of Students in response to neigbor­hood complaints oflarge parties and generally annoying behavior. Some of these directives, ('having the authority of a Univerisity regula­
. tion' ), are rather harsh. For instance, alcoholic beverages have been forbidden at one house, and another has been told its parties must end by 1:00 a.m. (shades of parietals! ). All of this taken at first glance gives the im­pression that the Administration has sudden!)· taken an intense interest in how off-campus students live their 1ives. This gives many the uneasy feeling that someone is breathing down their necks. It is common knowledge that most students move off-campus to escape the oppressive regulations of dormitory living. Once 0-C, students feel they are free to live how they pleaSe, despite what DuLac says to the contrary. Understandably, wheri the Dean of Students starts advising what kind of munchies to serve at your parties, or telling you how many people can spend the night at 

your house, people start to get nervous. 
I talked to Dean Roemer to see ifl could get a little more information. As I sat in his office, I saw my red-hot, impassioned editorial mel­ting away before my eyes. I asked him, why the sudden interest in off-campus students? He explained that, first, tbes~ types of inci­dents, although infrequent, do 'occur, and 0-C students aren't complete strangers to the · pean's office. Second, all of the letters I men­'. rioned were prompted by the inquiries and suggestions of groups outside the University. In other words, the Dean ofStudents isn't out peeking through windows looking for people breaking rules. In fact, it's probably a safe bet that the Administration is well-aware of the fact that many 0-C students smoke pot, drink to excess, and sleep together. But when people outside the University start asking for disciplinary measures because they can no longer tolerate student behavior, or letters · from city officials start appearing on Dean Roemer's desk, something must be done. So, 
what at tirst looked like the beginnings of an 0-C pogrom actually was a group of distinct, separate incidents dealt with on an individual basis. What lends the cachet of suspicion in students' minds is the fact that the events oc­curred at about the same time, and fn a few cases, dealt with the same group of in­dividuals. 
What it comes down to is this: students off­campus want to live as they please without the vaguest threat ofAdministration interferenco:e. At the same time though, the University has a responsibility of maintaining its rapport with the community, and when student lifestyles threaten this, action must be taken. Although a bit cold, the directives actually make sense. Off-campus students may feel no longer responsible to the University for how they live, but they are responsible to their neigh­bors. Simple respect for individual rights is more than enough to keep Dean Roemer from telling 0-C people how to take out the trash. 
More of status and hierarchy 
In his editorial of Sept. 27, Paul McGinn uses his attack on status and hierarchy to subt­ly advocate a pseudo-socialist regime, in which the sole incentive for individual action is the welfare of the group. He voices an array of complaints about university life, but at­tributes the single cause of each to be the hierarchical structure. His implied solution is that the structure should, ideally, be eliminated. 
Karen Miranda 
Counterpoint 
Initially, McGinn criticizes the titling sys­tem, because it involves role-playimg and makes distinctions between university presi­dents, professors, assistant professors, and stu­dents. But why shouldn't there be a distinction between "Dean" and "Squiggy"? The titles are a function of distinction, not vice-versa. 
"(he breakdown of formality which would occur with the elimination of roles and titles would also destroy much of the respect 
· deserved by those in accomplished positions. The roles people play are, after all, largely of their own choosing -a product of their own ambitions, achievements, and talent. These at­tributes would go largely unrecognized and untapped by others were it not for the structure of the meritocracy. McGinn himself claims the title Editorials Editor, a title from which I'm sure he would find some personal and communal benefits if he looked closely enough. 
Besides, the differentiation ofroles is essen­tial to our society. It is a well-documented theory that organismic functionalism where each part of the whole has its own separate purpose -is a more efficient and in­tegrated system than one in which all mem­bers ofa group are identical. McGinn seems to appeal to some bizarre utopia where we are all janitors. 
The questions of wild-fire bureaucracy and academic elitism are separate matters; they are not necessarily consequences of status and hierarchy, but rather ofover-blown pride 

arid lack of humanism on the part of those in respected positions. 
Status among students is not an institutional creation, such as tenure, but a social situation among students themselves, again a function of pride or exhibitionism. What McGinn implies with his complaint that students gain status by superficial accomplishments, is that they should be recognized by more real, in­dividual, purposeful achievements. Hence, not an elimination of statvs at. all, but merely recognition for the right reasons. 
Hierarchy functions as a tool for organizing society, giving each of us a structure in vt>hich to work and an opportunity to perform a specific, needed function. A system of such status does not make anybedy more or less human, because of higher or lower status levels -that's a human prejudice. Systems of rank meritize positions, evaluating the worth ofcertain functions in society, and encourag­ing people to t111 those positions most valued. Janitors and gardeners are needed, but doc­tors and teachers are more valued, for-they are the catalysts to an increasingly healthy and
. 

knowledgeable society. Anypoqy can be a janitor; not everybody can be a doctor. 
It is not status or hierarchy that is the root of McGinn's frustration; it is rather the lack of respect given to people in all categories. Per­haps a close approximation of McGinn's vi­sion is a Notre Dame where, regardless of position or title; we all consider ourselves stu­dents, people who learn many things from life a.nd others. This attitude would humble elitists, and boost the confidence of "underlings" when they realize that a world of all students means a world ofall professors, in which we are all simultaneously learners and teachers. · ·. ':· _... .W . 
Ofcourse there are flsi:~s ihootk hierarchy as in any system, but that ·doesn't make the whole structure totally worthless. What we must preserve is not the equality of every position, but the equality of respect for each function in the system; for without each, the whole community would fall apart. It's just that it would fall apart faster without a univer­sity president than without a dining hall worker.

How throats and blowoffs play the same game 
I was sitting in a business class last week when my professor gave us a little pep talk. "My main objective for giving tests is to rank the class in a normal distribution. Lo6k at the person next to \'OU. He is the one you have to beat to get the '."-" He is your competition." 
Diane Dirkers 
Campus Quips 
The "Fighting Irish" ..."This one's for the Glpper" ...Rah, rah, rah -the spirit of com­petition is what propels the University of Notre Dame to excellence. But when does the "thrill of victory" begin to overshadow the real reason we are supposed to be here -to improve ourseltes! 
It is true to a point that comparison to the performance of others is a valuable indicator of achievment. When comparison becomes the on~}' indicator, competition is no longer 
constructive -it is downright demeaning. 
The pressure to attain a high G. P. A. on this campus is very strong -so strong, ~n fact, that manv interviewing seniors are shocked to lear~ that employers are not that interested in 
grades. 
Two "classes" of students blatantly display the adverse affects of the quest for the al­mighty "A" -the throats and the blowoffs. 
From time to time, we're all called throats for putting in an extra six or seven hours of studying for that one crucial test or paper. But the throat is one who pushes aside all other aspects of his life to concentrate solely on grades. 
Throating it out is a nice way to obtain documented proof of success. But is it worth the sacritke of oneself in those areas of per­sonal living that cannot be measured! 
Ablowoffspends his time in the bars and in front of his television set staging his protest: "I could get a -t.O as easily as the next guy," as he pops the tab on his next Old Milwaukee, "but 
. 

it's ridiculous toput out tnar much "tfort and 
. ·'1-t '· .
give up my lite outside ofclasses. 

The blowoff is not as concerned with learn­ing as he is in "beating the system" -getting the grades without doing the work. In es­sence, he is as involved in the "grade game" as _his counterpart -the throat. The typical blowoff is only happy with "B" or "A" (if he can get it). Ifgrades were truly unimportant, a straight 2.0 average would be sufficient. Speaking from experience, I know that a 2.0 just won't do for most of us blowoffs. 
Beyond these two student categories, many professors play a role in this game as well. 
Some professors believe that all the stu­dents need a (i. P. A. boost and teach candy­coated courses with at least a guaranteed "B." Students wait in line for checkmarks to get that elective which gives them an easy "A"­even if they have no interest in the course or feel that it is worthless. 
Others like to "separate the men from the boys" and give challenging tests over material 
. that was poorly (or never) taught and place 
ambiguously worded questions on an exam to 
fool studenrs or include problems that only a 
handful will be able toattempt to assure a nor­
mal distribution ofgrades. 
In the student world, this is known as the 
tine art ofpimping. A. low score on apimp test 
is not an indicator of material learned, but of 
bad luck in guessing. 
The teachers who deserve respect are those 
who challenge the student by forcing him to 
learn or flunk. Tests and grades should be 
direct indicators ofmaterial mastery, not sym­
bols ofcompetitiveness. 
Students and faculty alike must realize the 
true meaning of the letter grade. It is only an 
indicator -not an achievement in itself, if 
you adhere to the "it's not whether you win or 
lose:it's how you play the game" philosophy. 
What counts is what you've learned. Any 
measure which distorts that is worthless and 
leads to a potentially destructive game, the 
"game for grades."'

I was looking through my files yesterday, and came upon one called "Stories to be written." Herewith are the contents thereof: 
I like Ted Turner. 
Don't ask me why. He's arrogant, and egotistical, and can be more Steinbrennerish than the man himseli But I still like him. And I'm glad the Braves made the playoffs. 
Turner is the kind ofguy who knows what he wants, and is not afraid to go out and get it. He wanted to win the America Cup -and he did. He thought he could take on the TV networks and beat them at their own game -and it worked. He figured he could manage the Braves better than anyone else -and he tried it. Bowie Kuhn made him stop. Which may be the real reason I like Ted Turner. How can you dislike anyone who gets under Bowie Kuhn's skin? 
So, I'mglad Ted Turner and the Braves won the West. 
Cub fans should be glad the Braves made it, too. Now, 
if you can figure out why, it shows just how much of a 
Cub fan you really are. Ifyou can't figure out why, then 
this is a good trick for getting you to read the rest ofthis 
column -because I'm not going to give the answer 
untillater. , 
I don't know if anybody cares, but National Hockey 
League exhibition games have been going on for a 
couple ofweeks. 
Speaking of baseball, which we were a minute ago, I 
think Ralph Houk should be Manager ofthe Year. Quiet 
down, there, you Harvey Kuenn fans in the back. Ralph 
took a team that just didn't have the starting pitching to 
be a contender, and kept them in the race until the final 
two weeks of the season. He did a masterful job han· 
dling his bullpen, but the lack of a single pitcher who 
could go seven strong innings consistently finally did 
the Red Sox in. 
Besides, just think where Harvey would have been if 
those ex-Red Sox players-Cecil Cooper, Ben Oglivie, 
and Rollie Fingers (OK, maybe I stretch things a little) 
-had stayed in Beantown. 
I don't know if anybody cares, but Quintin Dailey finally signed a contrac't with the Chicago Bulls this week. 
On the subject ofbaseball -and the Red Sox -again where would the Angels be without Fred Lynn and Don Aase? Where would they have been with Rick Burleson?

And what would have happened to this year's races if Boston had sent Lynn to the Dodgers for Steve Howe, Bob Welsh, and Mickey Hatcher -as originally planned? Instead, the Red Sox got Frank ("Everybody needs a good 6-14 starter who makes $400,000 a year") Tanana and Joe Rudi from the Angels. 
1don't know if anybody cares, but the two people in the picture won the men's and women's division ofthe Mr. America contest in New York last weekend. 
Why would any woman want to win theMr. America contest? 
By the way, not only did Cory Everson win the women's title, but she and her husband took the mixed pairs award. But, that's Lee Haney kneeling down, not Cory's husband. 
More baseball. Why are so many Orioles fans glad to be rid ofEarl Weaver? All the guy did was win at least 90 games in 12 of the last 14 seasons. 
Did it seem a little suspicious to you that Keith Jack­son and Howard Cosell kept mentioning that Earl had a great future ahead in broadcasting? Well, maybe it won't seem so strange when you hear that he's signed to do the playoffs, beginning tonight for ... 
May I have a drum-roll, please? 
... ABC Sports!! 
I don't know ifanybody cares, but Howard and Keith said "There's no tomorrow," 38 times -by unofficial tally -during Sunday's game. 
OK, Cub fans -here it is. 
In 1969, our Cubbies choked down the pennant in the stretch to the New York Mets. Then, in the first-ever divisional playoffs, the Mets topped the Atlanta Braves to get to the World Series. 

Obviously, the Cubs got no revenge this season. So, for all you true die-hards, at least the Braves have made a comeback, albeit 13 years later. ,­
Come to think of it, maybe that file was labelled "Stories not worth writing."

A.L. championship 

team, led the major leagues in run~ scored with H91 and homers with 
216. The Angels, who batted .274, were second in both departments with 814 and 186, respectively. 
The teams split the 12 games they played against each other this year. 
"It's evenly matched," said California Manager Gene Mauch, whose club clinched the AL west on Saturday. "As long as we play our game, it doesn't make any difference who we play. We're very com­fortable: with the way we're playing and with the way we're pitching" 
Mauch announced his pitching plans for the first three games Sun­day. TommyJohn, 4-2 for the Angels after being acquired from the New York Yankees on Aug. 31 and 14-12 overall, will pitch the opener for California 
Right-hander Bruce K.isn 10-5, will start Game Two at Anaheim Stadium tomorrow night and left­bander Geoff Zahn, 18-8, will go in Game Three at Milwaukee on Friday. 
The Brewers are expected to start right-hander Pete Vuckovich, 18-6, in the opener, left-bander Mike Caldwell, 17-13, in Game Two and right-hander Don Sutton, 4-1 since being acquired from Houston at the end ofAugust, in Game Three. 
John scattered eight hits and allowed two unearned runs in a 5-2 victory by the Angels over the Brewers on Sept. .3, the first game the .39-year-old veteran pitched for California. Vuckovich was .3-0 against the Angels this season. 
The Brewers haven't won a divi­sion title since they were born as the Seattle Pilots . in 1969. The club moved to Milwaukee in 1970. 
The only time the Brewer~ have taken part in a playoff situation wa~ last year, when in a strike-shortened season, they won the AL east's second-halftitle before losing to the New York Yankees in a best-of-five series to determine the division win­ner. 
The Angels have won just one championship in their 22-year his­tory, the 1979 AL west title. They were beaten by Baltimore in the League Championship Series. 
Neither the Brewers, arriving late Sunday night, nor the Angels practiced Monday. 
Knuckleballer Phil Niekro of At­lanta is on a roll, but the St. Louis Cardinals are grateful to be con­fronting him instead of the Los An­geles Dodgers. 
"It's not that the Braves have bad starting pitching," said infielder Mike Ramsey in sizing up the team for which Niekro will pitch in the Wednesday opener to the National League's championship series. "But you've seen what kind of trouble (Fernando) Valenzuela and (Jerry) Reuss give us." 
The 17-4 record ofthe 4 3 year-old Niekro aside, the Cards say they fel more comfortable against Atlanta's staff heading into the best-of-five NL playoff. 
"I just think we play better against the Braves," said St. Louis outfielder Lonnie Smith. "Their pitchers are more a mixture of breaking-ball pitchers instead of fastball pitchers like the Dodgers.·· 
Niekro, who stood 1-0 this year and is 1S-1' lifetime against the Cards, will carry a: string of 26 2-3 innings without allowing an earned run into the opener.

Neither the Milwaukee Brewers nor the California Angels have had much experience in playoff situa­tions. But one of them is going to represent the American League in the World Series later this month. 
And if statistics can be trusted, there should be a bit of offensive fireworks when the clubs square off in the best-of-five AL championship Series, which opens tonight at Anaheim Stadium. 
"We have great power, they have great power," said Milwaukee Manager Harvey Kuenn. after the Brewers trounced Baltimore 10-2 Sunday to win the AL east title by one game over the Orioles. "We hit for average and they hit for average. There's going to be a lot of runs scored." 
The Brewers, who hit .279 as a

Two interceptions 

Brown overcomes old imag~s 

By STEVEN lABATE 
Sports Writer 
As players and <;oaches in Miami, Fla., Pittsburgh, Pa., University Park, Pa., and Los Angeles, Calif., studied Sunday morning's sports pages, it would come as no surprise if by some chance they winced when they saw Notre Dame's defensive statistics. 
Yes Dan Marino, Todd Blackledge, and other future opposing quarter­backs, the Notre Dame pass defense is tor real. Up until Saturday's I 1-3 win against Michigan State, the secondary was a question mark. 
But after the game, all the ques­tions had been answered. 
Stellar performances were turned in by all the defensive backs, but un­doubtedly weakside cornerback Chris Brown's was the best. Perhaps the best measure of a defensive back's ability is determined by the frequency with which the opposing quarterback throws into his area. 
So far this season, the ball has been 
thrown into Brown's direction very 
infrequently. His play on the weak 
side corner has provided the Irish 
with better coverage than Fireman's 
Fund Insurance. 

thwarted the toss by making his second career interception. 
In the fourth quarter, Brown's alertness resuted in another MSU turnover. "I was laying back," he reflects. "I had hit the receiver and dropped back to my zone. The quar­terback scrambled and never saw me running to cover the receiver; he only saw Duerson." Like an outfiel­der drawing a beat on a pop fly, Brown just sat back and waited for the ball to come down. 
On the almost-third interception, Brown had perhaps his easiest play of the day, but the ball slipped through his hands and went to Duer­son who returned the ball 48 yards. 
Brown attributes part of his success in the secondary to the fact that he played quarterback in high school. "I think it as helped me to a great extent," says the native of Owensboro, Ky. "I can relate to what the quarterback is thinking, and what receivers he'll go to at cer­tain times." 
However Brown is quick to note that his exceptional play and that of the secondary as a unit in Saturday's victory was due in a large part to the play of the defensive line, which to­tally shut down MSU's running game ( 19 yards net ) and harrassed the Spartan's quarterbacks all day. 
These are happier times for Chris Brown, who, like many other Irish players, experienced a lot ofturmoil last year. Brown, in particular, was blamed solely for the 1 5-14 loss to Purdue, in which he was thrust into a key role late in the game after John Krimm suffered an ankle injury. 
Brown was sent in to cover the Boilermakers' superb flanker Steve Bryant, and was beaten on both the winning touchdown and the subse­quent two-point conversion that sent the Irish reeling to their second straight defeat. Perhaps unfairly, most ofthe blame for the 1-2 record at that point fell squarely on Brown's shoulder pads. 
But all of that has changed now. After three games this year, Notre Dame is 3-0, and now that it seems that Brown and his cohorts in the defensive !>econdary have come around, opposing teams should have more and more trouble registering that first notch in the Irish loss column. 
So be forewarned, Messrs. Marino, Blackledge, et at Chris Brown refuses to be picked on anymore. 
When MSU'sJohn Leister and Rick=============================== 
Kolb did test Brown, he made them regret it by picking off two passes and narrowly missing a third (Dave Duerson grabbed it instead). 
On the first interception Brown says of the play, "It's one of their favorite plays. They sneak (Daryl) Turner behind me and the free safety on a deep post corner out." But on this particular play, Brown

Winning two of its three games this weekend_ enabled the Notre Dame baseball team to finish second in the Bradley University Fall Baseball Tournament. After a dis­appointing 4-2 loss Saturday morn­
ing to Illinois State, the Irish defeated Bradley, I2-6, in the after­noon and V~araiso, 3-2, on Sunday. The Irish~o'W sport a 3-5 record for the fall season. 
"No doubt we should have won all three games this week." commented Coach Larry Gallo. "This (the loss to Illinois State) was the fifth time we beat ourselves this season," 
Against Illinois State pitcher Steve Whitmyer had a no-hitter and a 2-0 lead after five inning~. However, the leadoff batter in the.bottom half of the sixth singled up the middle off Whitmyer's glove, breaking up the no-hit effort. Whitmyer walked the next batter, then after retiring the next two men, he attempted to pick a runner off first base, but the throw went into r.ight field allowing one runner to score. Another run scored, tying the game, on a poor throw to the plate by the right field'er after he retrieved the ball. The damage for the inning was not over. The next batter singled and scored as the following hitter blasted a home run, making the score, 4-2. 
Despite the sixth inning "mental breakdown," Gallo was happy. "I was pleased. It was a good weekend. The players are playing like they know how to play."said Gallo. "They are improving. However, there is still a lot of room for improvement." 
In the game against Bradley, the Irish jumped out to a 4-0 lead in the top of the first on a double by Rick Chryst and a home run by designated hitter David Clark. 
Bradley tied the score in the bot­tom of the inning with three con­secutive walks and a grand slam home run offpitcher Bill Matre. 
Notre Dame opened the game up in the sixth inning with six runs. The turning point of the inning was a well executed suicide squeeze bunt by catcher Mike Doming. 
In the victory over Valparaiso, Buster Lopes pitched the first seven innings for the Irish. Tom Clements came in for Lopes with the score tied 2-2. 
Notre Dame scored the winning run in the top ofthe ninth when Val­paraiso failed to turn a double play, allowing a runner from third to score. 
"Its nice to win those one run ball games," stated Coach Gallo. The on­ly other one run game was last week's victory over the same Val­paraiso team. 
Clark was the big contributor for the Irish this weekend. His five hits in II at bats broke him out ofhis one of nine batting slump. In addition to the home run against Bradley, Clark had two doubles and four RBI's over the weekend. 
Tom Conlin also played well as he pitched in relief twice for Notre Dame. 
Leyes takes linksters to Invitational victory

Sports Writer 
Junior Frank Leyes fi;ed a two un­der par 69 to lead the Notre Dame golf team to the team championship of the ninth annual Notre Dame Fall Invitational yesterday afternoon on the Burke Memorial Golf Course. Leyes' score also enabled him to capture the individual champion­ship. 
The Notre Dame "Gold" team finished first with a total of 3 7 3 strokes, while Tri-State University (379), and the Irish "Blue" team 
( 386) placed second and third respectively. In all, 16 teams com­peted. 
"This is the t1rst time in four years that we've won our own invitational, so this really feels good," said senior captain Stoney Ferlmann. "It was like not being able to win a home game. 
"Frank Leyes and Dave Moorman really came through for us," said Ferlmann. "Frank birdied four out of five during one stretch on the back nine." 
Junior Joe Celarek paced the 
"Blue" team with a 72 good for 
second place on the afternoon. 
Moorman and junior classmate 
Dave Pangraze each shot a 74, good 
for a third place tie, and senior Craig 
Peters and freshman John 
O'Donovan t1nished with 78's. 

Netters disappointed by tourney performance 
By DAVE STANG 
Sports Writer 
There was some success, but dis­appointment was the main word from the Milliken Tournament in Decatur, Illinois where members of the Notre Dame women's tennis team participated this weekend. It was strictly a singles tournament in which most of the results were less than pleasing. 
Freshman Mary Colligan played very well at singles against the top singles players from the other teams. She was victorious thru three matches, before losing in the finals toJoan Finder ofpast Irish opponent Southern Illinois at Edwardsville in a three set match. Notre Dame's usual No. 4 singles player, Lisa Lafratta, also played extremely well in win­ning her first three matches. Her downfall in the semifinals was Joan Finder, the girl who eventually beat Colligan for the championship. LaFratta continues to improve her new-found serve and volley game with each match. 
"The three doubles teams fielded were a disappointment," said Coach Sharon Petro. "Susie Panther and Laura Lee should have won the tournament." Instead, they had to settle for the consolation crown af­ter losing in the first round to Patty Tiddy and Laura Foederen of South­ern Illinois. Notre Dame's no. 1 team then regrouped and won their next four matches, eventually defeating SlU-E's Jan Petras and Leah Schmidt in the finals. Panther played despite a painful back which will force her to play doubles for the rest ofthe fall season, instead of her usual spot at no. 1 singles. Greta Roemer and Cathy Schnell ofthe Irish faced some very tough competition, but they played wt;ll before bowingout ii:I the second round. Notre Dame's Lisa 
Gleason and Camille Cooper went against yet another team from SlU-E when they also lost in the second round ofthe tOurney. 
Coach Petro understandably had mixed feelings about her girls' play in the tournament. "I was really impressed with the play of Colligan and LaFratta, who faced mostly the no. l and no. 2 players from the other teams," she stated. "Our tirst doubles team could have played bet­ter, and should have won the tourna­ment, but their injuries were definitely a factor."Petro was refer­ing to Panther's constant back pain, and Lee's illness, which forced her to miss Monday's practice. "It's very tough to gain momentum when we can never have full team practices:: said Petro. "The injuries have a very big impact on our play, but hopeful­ly we will be able to regroup for our invitational next week" 

Laura Lee 

The Irish Invitational, being played next Sunday and Monday, will feature Colligan, LaFratta, Cooper, and Gleason at singles, and the teams of Panther/Lee and Roemer/Schnell at doubles in a team tournament at the Courtney Tennis Courts. Before the invitational, the Irish have a rematch with DePaul University in Chicago today, and they travel over to Saint Mary's to face the Belle's on Thursday after­noon. 
Erratum 

In yesterday's Observer Daphne Bailie incorrectly stated that the last time Notre Dame won a football game without scoring a touchdown was against LSU in 1970. The Irish won the 1979 Michigan game by a 12-10 margin on four Chuck Male field goals. The Observer regrets the error.
