Senior Fellow nominations 
The selection process of the 1 971 Senior Class Fellow A ward is under way as the Senior Fel­lows Committee members pre­pare for next week's initial nom­inations by the student body. The selection process will con­clude sometine in March when the recipient comes to Notre Dame. 
The Senior Class Fellow A­ward was created in 1968 in lieu of the patriot of the year award because of the controversy in­volved in defining patriotism. The purpose of the fellow award as stated by Rich Linquanti is "to bring to the University, and senior class, for a period of time, a man of interest who personally offers something to Jearn. The recipient of the award will come to Notre Dame for two to four days and hold a major lecture as well as a number of informal meetings with seniors. The two previous winners have been Sen­ator Eugene McCarthy and Re­presentative Allard K. Lowen­stein. 
Next Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, students will be al­-lowed to nominate anyone of their choice. The members of rhe selection committee, headed by Linq uanti, will then collect and edit the nominations before 
narrowing the Jist to one hun­dred. Each member of the ten man selection committee will then research ten names and report his findings to the com­mittee. After the research is completed, around Christmas break, the committee will reduce the Jist to fifty names. 

All of the remaining fifty will be contacted and those who agree to participate, usually a­bout seven to twelve, will be placed on the final ballot. The 
senior class will vote from the final list probably around the beginning of the second semes­ter. The recipient will be an­nounced about a month before his appearance, tentatively scheduled for sometine in March just before Easter. 
Publicity Chairman Carl Rak said the committee hopes "to see if it is possible to steer clear of the political field this year and consider entertainers, writ­ers, and artists." 
In the past, the winners as well as most of the contenders have been involved in politics." 
Rak speculated that there would be support for Eric Hof­fer, Kingman Brewster, and Leonard Bernstein as well as political figures such as Jesse Unruh and George McGovern. 

CNC plans adlvlfles 
The Committee for a New Congress, headed by Steve No­vak and aided by faculty mem­ber Mr. John Ros, met last night for the first time since last year in what was termed a strategy session. 
In an interview today, Novak revealed that the small meeting was mainly involved with organ­izing basic plans for the Novem­ber elections. The Committee, whose National headquarters are 
at Princeton University and whose purpose, according to No­vak, is to aid the election of peace and civil liberties candi­dates, will concentrate in local elections if the Princeton Plan fails. 
Indicating that there was a lot of work to be done, Novak explained that the Committee will co-ordinate student involve­ment in races here, in particular the election of Representative John V. Brademas and Senator Vance Hartke of Indiana. 
Although still looking for o­ffice space and a meeting room, the group is tentatively schedul­ing a meeting for Tuesday night. They are looking for members who signed up last year and any new members.

Insanity 
I was as surprised to meet the man as I would be if Sophia Loren asked for my Notre Uame sweatshirt through the mails. It was late last June, here in South Bend at a coffee shop downtown, when I met the most amazing man that was ever born. I had escaped to the central complex of the River City from my duties as editor of a 
newspaper for the nuns and priests that attended Notre Dame's summer session; a bi-weekly rag that berated the student religious for their presumed political apathy and ignorance. 
Exhau~ted from my day's work of browbeating our few readers, I was mulling over a cup of coffee and the day's catastrophes con­tainP.d within The New York Times, when this semi-ragged old chap walks in and parks on the neighboring stool. As I grimaced and groaned over the days news, the old man kept peering aside at me emmitting an occasional chuckle. ' 
"Pretty funny, isn't it?" he said. 
"What's that?" 
"Insanity," he replied. 
"What about it?" 

"It's pretty funny to me that you get so excited about all that insanity in there," he explained. "Oh, well, you know, I like to keep up on things around the world, you know," I said. 
A smirky "Oh" was his only reply, and he resumed stirring his coffee. But he wasn't going to escape me. My journalistic tempera­ment had been challenged, and I intended to badger him until I had figured him out. 
And I could not believe my ears. This floppy oldtimer didn't give a damn about anything even remotely connected to politics. He was apolitical to a degree that defied the word apathetic. To him politi­calness equalled nothingness. Senators and Congressmen were as un­~nown as the fleas on a passing hound, and were probably less tmportant. Contemporary warfare raised not even an eyebrow and the latest hippie beatings passed by without comment. The car~ings on of royal try provoked neither scorn nor admiration . 
. ~y condemnation of our President, all my moralizing and prosely­hzmg, my sadness and even my final admission of ultimate despair for the future were wasted addresses. I could have been Lenin talk­ing to Alice in Wonderland. And the end of my oration brought a strange response. 
"How's your love life,kid?" 

Before I could think of a reply he had slid off his swivel stool and picke~ up m:, newspaper. "You know, kid, politics will just bum you nght up. And then he just walked on out the door. 
He ~ad de~t a low blow. For two years I had been surrounded by fellow JOUrnaltsts, non-violence advocates, student politicos and pro­fessors, all ?f wh~m possessed a nearly absolute stand ~n nearly every concetvable tssue.

VAMPIRES OF THE WORILD UNIGHT 
Up against the tombstone, human speciest pig! We the monsters of the world demand that all discrimination on the basis of species end forthwit. We demand that all the prejudice, all . the malicious lies about monsters end immediately. Nor do we condone in any way, those who would treat monsters as if they didn't exist with a period of "benign neglect." We want, for example, that History cour:>es stop treating monsters as they didn't exist or as some inhuman mass. We demand Monster History courses in colleges as part of a Monster Studies Program, taught solely by monsters, run by monstrous administrators. Since how can one teach Monster Studies unless one has the experience of being a monster? 
As an example of how monsters have JTlistreated by our speciest Establishment, there is Count Dracula, Head of Vampire Liberation. In an exclusive uncut

One for the Record 
Observer Record Reviewer 
I'm always up for a little notoriety, so when I learned that this IJJper was in some need of a record reviewer I immediately volun­teered my valued services. There is always some danger in assum­ing such a post, for in doing so one puts himself up as a self-styled expert in a field where personal preference is paramount. As a word of warning, I like the Association, Poco, James Taylor, Steve Stills, and Jerry Garcia. I abhor The Iron Butterfly, the Jackson Five, Canned Heat and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. So if I shoot down any of your old favourites, take it for what it's worth. 
This past week I got two "live" albums to break myself in on. I was a little apprehensive because, as a rule, live albums usually leave a good deal to be desired, and I really didn't want to play super critic on my first try. Happily, Neil Diamond's newest album, entitled, appropriately enough, Neil Diamond Gold,does nothing but credit the talented performer from New York. And a golden album it truly is, as Diamond, always in top form, runs through a spate of his big hits, Holly Holy, Sweet, Carolina, Soli­tary Man, as well as some of his newer material, such as Lordy. 
On the album jacket is a quote from Cashbox magazine, which just about sums up the whole performance "On stage Diamond radiates the same excitement that has made pop stars from Sinatra to Presley, and it's a sensation that can't be described only felt." And after listening to his vemion of Brother Love.; Travelling Salvation Show there can be no doubt about it. This is real audience participation music. The man stands up there on the stage, sweat dripping on his flowered shirt, and dares you not to get into the music. Close your eyes and there's the country preacher, bringing the faithful to their knees with one withering glance. 
Maybe I'm a little prejudiced, but I've always enjoyed Neil Diamond (anyone from Coney Island has to be on the balL) His lyrics seldom jump out and knock you over, as James Taylor's do, but they get the job done none the less, as in the explosive 
Lordy: 
"Look at the way I made my bed, 
Rocks and nuts and I'm half crazy. 
Get to dreamin' I was dead but, 
I ain't been that lucky lately." 

_ Besides offe_ring up the above mer.tioned Lordy Diamond sings fmt rate verswns of some of his many hits; Cherry, Cherry, Thank the Lord for the Nightime, Kentucky Woman and Sweet Caroline, to name a few. He also does a magnificent 'job on J oni Mitchell's very beautiful Both Sides Noww,, (Judy Collin's version of which pales in comparison.) 
Technically, the album falls a little short. You earphones freaks will be crestfallen to learn that separation is almost nonexistence. ~t~t ~;is seems to be one of the predictable shortcomings of such 
hve albums. As for the non-separated music itself it is sur­prisingly good when one considers the small size of Diamond's backup group (guitar, bass, and drums). 
_All in all it's an excellent package, complete with a bad-ass picture of Mr. D. on the back of the jacket. It's well worth your ~ard earned coin, so if you've had any doubts, go on out and buy 
lt. 
On the short end of the stick, Bill Cosby also has a new album out. Don't get me wrong, I think Cosby is great, but the fact of the matter is the Bill Cosby Live isn't. I've always been a little disappointed in his albums (I have the feeling that Cosby has 
flooded the market and thus hurt himself). The main problem is, however, the simple fact that Bill Cosby must be seen to be fully appreciated. So much of his act is in the visual, which of course cannot be captured on today's stereo lp's. 
This is not to say that the record is a waste of the plastic it's pressed on. To the contrary, it contains some very funny stories about all sorts of pregnant creatures (Bill's wife included) feats of great athletic prowness (Bill's encounter with a sevent~ year old man on the handball court), and all sorts of other similarly neat things. At one point, Cosby looks at his new born son and laments, "This can't be mine. I ain't ever made anything this ugly, n~t even when I was in the Navy." He also tells of a harrowing tnp to the zoo, where his little daughters display a curious talent for having to go to the john at the damndest times. 
In the long run, however, "Bill Cosby Live" falls short of Cosby's usuaL If you're in the market for one of his albums I'd suggest one of his earlier outing. Or maybe wait for his next ~ne. 
So that's it for this time around, fans. I leave you with the words of Jerry Garcia, of the Grateful Dead who at times is wont to utter, "We love you, but Jesus loves yo1~ best so we bid you 
goodnight." ' i ntcrview that Playboy will tritely imitate next month, yours trury, Kodan, has asked him about his own experiences and his organization. Count Dracula, for those of you don't know has contributed to c i vi I i z ation in the Poverty stricken distrid both during and after his life. He has been a staunch worker for Zero Population Growth and has for three hundred years, conducted a hunger strike, drinking only liquids. Since the Observer tape recorder malfunctioned during the interview as usual, I cannot recount the int}:rview, but rather will use my memory of it to give a picture of the count rather 
than  the  speciest  slander  of  
Bram Stoker.  
From  humble  beginnings,  

Count Dracula rose to great 
heights. In boldly challenging 
the totalitarian power structure 
of his time, including the rigidly 
antihuman Church, he was an 
outstanding success. Though the 
Church and Emperor had guns, 
Dracula, a true follower of 
Christ, fough.t nonviolently. 
Instead of injuring his 
opponents, Dracula influenced 
their minds with his dedication, 
piety, prayers, sacrifice, 
wolfbane, black cats and 
hypnosis. He grew so dangerous 
to his enemies that Dracula 
suffered the ultimate fate of the 
nonviolent in their fight against 
the -violent -Death. But even 
that could not vanquish him for 
like Christ he rose from the act 
of violence antd returned from 
his grave to haUJnt his opponents. 
Yet still he is nonviolent, 
vanquishing his enemies without 
leaving a mark, except for a 
slight one on their necks. 
Unable to use violence against Dracula, his enc!mies have turned to slander. The yellow journalists were hired and they carefully combed through the Count's background looking for muck. At long last it was found and starting with an issue of Unlife, it was spread. "Count Dracula is a pervert." "Did J. Edgar Hoover know of Dracula's fetish in 1785?" asked Scanlan's. 
Yes, it is true, the Count has a fetish for necks. He likes to bite his partner's necks and suck their blood. In the puritannical society of his time and now, vampirism, as the fetish is called, was irrationally ab-horred. Even today, vampirism is punished by death in all fifty states. In most of the states, the punishment is a cruel, painful stake through the heart. 
His secret revealed, Dracula's popularity waned. He · was harassed by policemen, segregated by his society, discriminated in jobs and forced to register as a Vampire and appear before the House Committee on Supernatural Activities. In the famous Vampire Hunt of 1952, he was sorely persecuted by Tricky Dick Checkers. Checkers accused him of influencing the nation's youth, subverting its morals, and engaging in international vampire conspiracy. 
The Count in a famous speech confronted Checkers, "There are some who find vampires hiding under their beds. They blame vamoires for evervthinl! from 
plagues of mice to fogs. They 
say we kill people. They spread 
fear through society and use it 
for their own demagogery. They 
have people believing they aren't 

safe walkmg down the street in 
the vampire section of cemetery 
town. They would have you 
believe that we are worshippers 
of the Devil and enemies of all 
good." 
"Does that get you cross-" 
"Don't say that," yelled Drac 

in response to the question of 
Arthur J. Pears, disguised as 
Senator Halfbright. 
As we all know Count Dracula was acquitted when he dramatically proved that a picture of him, used as evidence, was doctored since it showed hi~ reflected in a mirror, talking With John Lindsay, Ted Hesburgh and Huntz HalL Yet despite his legal victory, his social and political persecution continues." 
Our government kills 

thousands of people a year but 
persecutes me for performing an 
act of love. As Doctor David 
Rubish said on the Johnny 
Griffett Show 'Sex is basically a 
fun thing."' 
Th counter the speciest 

antivampire laws, Count Dracula 
has organized Vampire 
Liberation. This organization has 
vociferously campaigned for the 
legalization of vampirism. "What 
two people do in private is no 
business of the law," says the 
Count. Not only in private, 
however, for vampires demand 
the right to express their 
affection in public like normal 
people do. 
"If normal people can kiss, 

why can't we bite?" asked the 
Transylvanian Crusader. 
Vampire Liberation is also out to explian away some of the common myths about vampirism. Vampirism does not cause hair tttto grow on the palms of the hands. Vampires do not spread rabies. Batman is not

How to keep your Head Up 
after being Stood Up 
Question: What experience do nearly all N.D. men have in common? Answer, being stood up by a St. Mary's girL This can be a very_ disheartening and very trying ordeal for any self-respectmg, hale and h_~dy, would-be stud, particularly when he isn't used to such an occurrence. 
The young man's ego and self-esteem fall in serious danger of sinking to the same depths reached by the Baltimore Colts after the '69 superbowl, the Cubs after the '69 season, or Wilt Cham­berlain after any big game. 
In order to avoid such a possibility, our fallen hero must devise some way to save face with hirnsel( and with the fair young maiden. 
One method used by many, with little success, is tb tell the girl that he really didn't mind because when he got back to the dorm he got into a real neat football game with a bunch of the guys. ~This line leaves a little to be desired since he could have gotten mto a neat football game anytime.) 
Another method used is the line, "It's just as we:ll, I had a lot of bookin' to do anyway." (This line leaves a lot to be des,p-ed.) 
A more ingenious technique works as follows. The rejected lover calls up the girl the following day and asks in a worried v?ice, "Are you all right? When you didn't show up I was worried Sick that something awful had happened to you. I couldn't get ~QY sleep last ~ight just thinkinl! about how you mw;t have gotten 
mto an accident and were seriously hurt. Gee I'm glad you-'re
O.K." ' 
However, since the first two methods are mere rationalizations 
and the third method doesn't reallY save the self-pride, the fol­
lowing method is suggested. The guy calls the girl the next day 
and apologizes for not having shown up the night before. He tells her that an old friend of his from Chicago just happened to drop in on him and asked him to go out drinking with him. He tells her that the temptation to relive old times with his b111ddy was just too great. He has the option at this point of saying that he tried to call her, depending whether or not this would sound feasible. He concludes by saying that he hopes she wasn't put to too much inconvenience and that he can understand why she wouldn't want to go out with him anymore. 
This method works exceptionally well in all cases except one.. When the guy doesn't want to end the relationship.

Vampires do possess special powers, however, abilities that make him a good worker.. He can turn into a wolf, bat, fog or ray of moonlight; influence people's minds, control night creatures and beat Purdue. Vampires do have an unfortunate tendency to have sex in weird beds. 
Count Dracula still fights on. He was nearly killed by a fight with the Lone Ranger. The Masked Man tried to arrest Dracula in a vampire bar in the East Village. The Count had ordered a Bloody Mary, and tried to pick up the Lone Ranger, disguis,ed as one of the hemophiliac prostitues that inhabit the vampire bars. A scuffle ensued in which 108 silver bullets fired, but the Count only suffered from a few broken fangs.

Ollservlnslahl 
by Cliff Wintrode Observer Associate Editor When the first words of the Victory March resound through Stepan Center tonight at the Purdue pep rally, a tradition will be broken that extends long before the immortal George Gipp donned a uniform for Knute Rockne. Every pep rally since the first Notre Dame football teams cleated up in the 1890's has been scheduled for the Field­house, but this year the decaying structure feel victim to its own old age and a reordering of uni­versity priorities coupled with a. severe economic crisis. Tonight if all goes well, the only action on the Fieldhouse floor will be a stu­dent quietly sculpturing a twenty-one ton pinnacle of rock, just a faint whisper of the past wall to wall delerium that always prevailed the night before · a game. The Fieldhouse received the death sentence frolli the uni­versity administration last year whose financial troubles (a $900,000 defecit in fiscal 1970) prevented any serious considera­tion of renovating the ancient hulk. The then newly-organized University Arts Council entered an appeal of usefullness for the Fieldhouse as a perfect and the only place on campus where an arts center could be created. The Arts Council vowed to raise a million and a half dollars to do the Fieldhouse up right. The Administration reversed their earlier verdict of death and stopped the bulldozers, but granted the Arts Council only six months to raise the million and a half. Nowhere near this much money was collected, but the university softened and granted an extention of the deadline. T he extension did not prove to be enough time, but again an extension was granted. This extension is scheduled for ex·piration this fall and the chances of raising the quite tidy sum by then are less than nil. However from the little worry evinced by Arts Council officers and the lack of threats from the administration, it seems appa­rent that the University Arts Center, only an alias of the Fieldhouse, will stand with at least a few more graduating classes. The Arts Col.ij1cil held a stu­dent arts fair last spring to help promote the idea of a campus art center, and the free festival was a huge success. The "cultured" students adapted very easily to stage plays on the handball courts, paintings in the locker rooms, and bands on the main floor. Contributions were disappointingly small, but the in­terest was apparently there if not the coin. However, one had the feeling last year that lurking in the back of many minds who outwardly supported the arts center was the subversive thought that any way to save the Fieldhouse for pep rallys was justifiable and once the building was saved, they intended to liberate it for the rallys. Ever since school started this fall the great amount of talk about this possibility and a few bold statements of commitment to liberation have made the sneaky suspicion of last spring a reality. Jimmy the Greek would take 
NEW ROCK IN FIELDHOUSE 
a pep rally tonight in the Field­house off the board. Lloyd's of London would rather insure m, El AI flight to Amman than guarantee the sanci tity of that stone-face standing sentinel. 
The Chairman of the Univer­sity Arts Council and the Direc­tor of Security are beginning to get worried about the possibility of six thousand frenetic students busting windows and doors and stampeeding across the Field­house floor screaming for thei~ team, the Fighting Irish, to beat Purdue Saturday afternoon. 
Rob Bartaletti, Arts Council chairman, is not convinced how­ever, that the arts center will be transformed into a human zoo tonight. 
"I give students more credit than that," he explained calmly. "I think they will realize that the Fieldhouse is now their art center." 
Security Director Arthur Pears expressed ignorance about 
the  potential  threat,  but  was  
somewhat  disconcerted  by  the  
idea.
