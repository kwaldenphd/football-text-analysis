The letters contain a copy of Gassman's original proposals, in­cluding a financial estimate. He stated their purpose is to enable the trustees to examine the pro­posals more closely in order to generate their opinions concerning them to the administration. 
However, he added. "The trustees alone are not going to be be infl-uenced by evident student support. "It involves a lot of money. unlike the Farmer Brown issue or the new laundry pro­posals," he states, adding. "If we rely just on student input, it will not get it. We must have the support of the administration." 

The TV system's success de­pends upon ~hether the admini­strators will decide it is beneficial enough to warrant the high cost of installation. Gassman stated. The major question is if the University is willing to give more weight to the financing with Dr. James Frick. vice-president for public relations and development. but Gassman admitted that the University will prepare its own figures concerning the project.

an independent student ne\\'spaper serving notre dame and st. mary's 

by Barbara Breitenstein News Editor 

Fr. Theodore M. Hesburgh. University president, will meet with President-elect Jimmy Carter in Washington. D.C .. tomorrow to advise him on Cabinet and other high-level government appoint­ments and confer with Carter on a "special project." 
Hesburgh. who was contacted by Carter last Sunday, Nov. 14. and asked to be one of eleven persons who would advise him on appoint­ments. has thus far suggested SO names for the jobs. Hesburgh has talked with Hamilton Jordan, head of Carter's transition team, twice in this regard. 
Hesburgh will fly to Washington this afternoon primarily to confer with Carter on • • a special project which will require a decision by Mr. Carter very soon after he takes office," Hesburgh explained. However, Hesburgh would not specify what the project might be and explained that it would be made public at the appropriate time. 
While conferring with Carter, Hesburgh will present the Pres ident-elect with a list of SO addi­tional names of people Hesburgh considers to be "the best people in the country'' for various posts. 
"He wants the best people he can find for the jobs," Hestiurgh stated. 
Hesburgh denied rumors that he might be offered a Cabinet position during the meeting tomorrow, but did not completely rule out the possibility that he might be under consideration for such a post. 
"It's such an iffy thing." Hes­burgh said. "I don't really think I will be offered (a Cabinet position), but I haven't really thought about 
1t's such an iffy thing. 
I don't really think I will be offered a cabinet position, but I haven't really thought 
11bout it.' 
it. I just try to live day to day and 
take things as they come." 
Hesburgh said the eleven persons advising Carter on appointments will not meet as a group to discuss the subject. "We are each making our suggestions individually," he said, "which I think is good because then we are not comparing who we think is best for the jobs." 
"I also think it is important," 
Hesburgh continued, "that of the 
eleven people, four are women, three are black and one is Hispanic.'' 
Hesburgh noted that of the 100 people he will suggest to Carter. "some are women. some are minorities. some have had gov­ernment positions and some have not. I did not make my suggestions on those criteria... he explained. "I merely picked who I think are the top I00 people in the country... 
Carter revealed the list of eleven appointments advisers last Friday. Besides Hesburgh. they include Lucy W. Benson. former director of the League of Women Voters; Lane Kirkland. secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO; Vernon Jordan, executive director of the Urban League; Carol Foreman, executive director of the Consumer Federa­tion of America; Marian Wright Edelman, a black woman who heads the Children Defense Fund; and Robert Strauss, chairman of the Democratic Party. 
Vice-President-elect Walter Mondale will also have an important role in choosing admin­istration appointments, according to Hesburgh. 
Hesburgh speculated that Carter will probably narrow his extensive list of suggested appointees to five for each position and then make his decision from this reduced list. Carter's decisions should be final­ized by mid-December, Hesburgh noted.

ND student attacked by armed muggers 
By Patrick Cole Senior Staff Reporter 
A Notre Dame student was 

mugged in the vicinity of The 
Library and Nickies' early Friday 
morning at approximately 12 a.m. 
The victim was not seriously 
injured although the attackers took 
his wallet and wristwatch. 
The victim, Joseph Anderson, a 

junior from Bristol. Conn. and 
resident of Alumni Hall, told The 
Observer that he was stopped by 
"three blacks who jumped out from 
behind the bushes" by the corner 
of Francis and Howard Streets. 
Laundry proposal considered 
by Ke~·in M. Walsh -Staff REporter 
1 ne current proposal to install 

alternative iaundrv facilities for 
men at Notre Dan1e is presently 
being considered by the Business 
Affairs Office. according to Brother 
Just Paczesn~·. vice-president of 
student affairs. 
The proposal was originally 

submitted to the office of busincs., 
affairs on November .1 but the 
Student Government officials in 
response to the numerous criti· 
cism~ voiced b~· male students 
about the laundrv service. 
The measure ·being considered 

ealls for 12 to 15 washers and 
dr~-er~ to be placed in a central 
location on campus. This would 
serve as an inexpensive supplement 
to the laundrv service over the 
$2.60 weekly.limit enabling the 
men to wash delicate materials and 
to provids quick service for im· 
mediate laundry needs. 
Paoe.,n~· said that the propo~al 

wa., passed on to the oftice of 
Busines~ Affairs to find other 
locations than LaFortune for the 
installation of the washer., and 
drvers. Paczesnv cited lack of 
space and the problem of un· 
pleasant odors as reasons why 
LaFortune would not be an accept­
able place for the machines. 
Thomas Mason, vice-president 

for business affairs. stated. "The Business Affairs Office is favorable _to the idea of alternative laundry service" but he repeated the problem of finding a proper loca­tion for the laundry machines as well as expressing concern for the financial problems presented by 
the installation of them. 
When the Business Affairs Office 

develops a feasible proposal for a 
possible location of the machines, it 
will be sent to Paczesny for a final 
decision. Paczesny said, "I have 
no idea as to exactly when the 
decision will come, but it should be 
in a short period of time." 
"One of them had a knife. and one had a gun." Andl·r..,on ...aid. The police later informed Andcr~on that the gun wa~ prnbablv a revolver of some kind. 
Anderson told that the three black males. whom he estimated to be from I<) to 22 years of age. demanded him to give up his wallet. 
"They pushed me up against a car and said, 'Give it to me."· he continued. "One attacker put a knife on one side of me and the other stuck the gun in the other side." Anderson c\escribed the assailants as one wearing a red ski cap and one wearing a red ban· dana. The one with the ski cap possessed the revolver. 
After taking the wallet. which had a dollar bill and 75 cents in change. the three men asked if ht• had a watch, according to Anderson. 
"I told him I didn't have a watch." he said. "and he pulled back mv coat sleeve." Anderson. in fact: was wearing a watl·h. "And he said after that. 'Don't lie to me whitev."' 
"I wasn't.going to yell because I thought they were going to knife me," Anderson added. 

Anderson indicated that he asked for his I.D. card back. "One of them agreed, but the one with the gun said, 'no,' and hit me twice in the stomach with the gun." 
"It didn't really hurt," he said. "But they pushed me down after that and ran away. After I got pushed down. I ran from The Librarv to the Main Circle at Notre Dame ·in about seven and one-half minutes.'' 
There Anderson was attended by the Notre Dame Security and the South Bend Police Department was called. A report was taken b' noth 
Ico.1tinued on pagl' }. !

An estimated 800 to 900 Notre Dame students participated in last Fridav's Senior Death March de­scribed as "one of the best ever." Both student organizers and bar managers expressed their satis­faction with the student's behavior. 
Jim  Wolf.  chairman  of  the  
March.  described  the  event  as  
"fantastic".  

"I didn't receive an~· complaints from the bar~. the police or anyone else." he continued. "Even·bodv just had a really good time and was very well behaved." 
The manager of Fat Wally's. Paul Rizzo. also agreed on the good behavior of the crowd. 
"We were the first bar of the March." Rizzo said. "so nobodv was reallv drunk or rowdv. I think the who.lc idea is a ~erv nice tradition." · 
The se11iors began their drinking ~pree at noon in Fat Wallv's. According to Ken Girouard. s-enior class secrctar~·. most students then drove to The Library and parked their cars. Thev then marched to Corby's at 3. p.m.. Bridget McGuire's at 4 p.m .. Nickies at S 
p.m. and finall~· back to the ACC for the pep rally at 6:30 p.m. 
Girouard stated that thev• had contacted the police to inforni them of the Death March. "Thev were very nice to us and just asked us to tr~· to not block traffic." he said. 
Throughout the afternoon there was at least one squad car present behind Bridget McGuire's. Ac­cording to one of the policemen on duty. they were there to make sure no one got hurt. The policeman 
Homecoming '76 runs smoothly 
by Tom Duffev Staff Reporter 

Notre Dame's version of Home­coming, Around the World in 80 Days. went smoothly this weekend as the Senior class marched to their death Friday afternoon and the Doobie Brothers brought them, and thousands of others, back to life on Saturday night. 
Other Homecoming events also enjoyed a good deal of success, according to Co-ordinator Nancy Budds. 
The hall decoration contest in­volved six dormitories with Walsh Hall winning first prize of $1'00. Pangborn Hall captured second place and collected $50 for their fine effort. 
On Fridav afternoon. a hot-air balloon. piloted by Peter Krieg. found its way from Indianapolis to the Green field and gave a free "lift" to anyone courageous enough to accept the offer. Krieg took all of his passengers to a height of 550 feet and returned them back safely.

stated that there had been nc• problems or arrests and that the whole event was good "so long as no one gets hurt or out of hand." 
Another policeman also present 
remarked that "the only bad thing 
is that the students arc not giving a 
very good reputation to people 
driving by when they carry beer 
around." He continued to sav that 
it was against the law to ·carrv 
alcohol open in the streets but that 
no one was arrested. 
Of the four bars contacted. none 
reported any damage except for a 
hole in the bathroom door in 
Bridget's. Larrv Jeurkens, a 
bartender at Nickies. said their 
only problem was the litter out 
front which "onlv took I0 or IS 
minutes to clean ~p." 
Opinions on the size of the crowd in respect to past years varied from "about the same" to "a lot more". all four bartenders did agree that the students were much more behaved than in the past. 
Business increased 

C. B .. a bartender at Corbv's thought the whole thing was "great". He continued, "The crowd was probably the same size as in the past but I would sav the people were not quite as ro~·dy. We did sell a lot of beer. though." 
Nickies reported that thev went through more than 20 kegs-in the couro,c of the afternoon and sold 160 Nickie Burgers between Sand 6

"We've never done this much business in one afternoon." Bauer said. "I wish thev'd do it once a month." ·

Free University overwhelmed by 'fantastic' student response 
by Jan Libert Staff Reporter 

Response to the courses offered bv the Free Universitv is "f-antastic", according to s;.,ecial Projects Chairman Charlie Moran.

Business school awarded grant 
The apparent success of a pro­gram of assistance to firms spon­sored in the South Bend area by the Small Business Administration (SBA) has resulted in the renewal of a $5,000 annual grant to the College of Business Administra­tion. 
The program involves teams of Notre Dame students who serve as management consultants for owners of firms experiencing diffi­culties in some area of business operation, according to Francis A. Yeandel. assistant dean of the college and director of the pro­gram. The theoretical know-how acquired in classrooms is combined with the practical knowledge of the business operator to produce an­swers for many problems, he said. 
Under the guidance of faculty members, the student teams are assigned to a firm that has re­quested assistance from the SBA. The teams may spend up to one academic year completing a full study of all phases of operation before preparing an audit of their findings that includes recommen­dations. The latter may involve improved accounting procedures, a revision of marketing techniques or a suggested change of product manufactured. 
The college has been a partner in several SBA programs since the cooperative effort was initiated by Yeandel in 1973.

or  credit  given  and  arc  free  of

The  rla~scs  begin  the  week  of

Write A Letter 
The Hunger Coalition's drive to enlist the support of the Notre Dame -St. Mary's communi! y in their current offering of letters is particularly meaningful this time 
. of year. With the Thanksgiving holiday coming up, many ND-SMC students are heading home to warm houses and huge servings of turkey and football. Many of them are unaware that they can make a positive contribution toward alleviating some of the misery that most of the World population now faces. All the Coalition asks is that before they leave for home, students write a letter to their Congress­men or to President-elect Carter, asking their support for American participation in a world food reserve program. 
Religious platitudes aside, the Coalition makes a valid point that few Americans realize the truely astounding conditions of hunger and deprivations that now face most of the world's people. Those who do, often mistakenly believe that there is little that the United States can contribute that would stop the suffering. 
However, for a nation as large as ours, the possibility of a major role in arresting world hunger is a real one. The United States currently sells a little more than half of the grain being dealt on the world commodity markets. If only a portion of that grain was instead allocated for distribution to the world's poor, it would be a positive contribution to what has been in the past, a decidedly negative situation. This is the crux of the matter. No one can realistically argue that the United States can solve the hunger crisis alone. 
Certainly reform within each of the underdeveloped nations as well as material support from other wealth nations is imperative if a final solution is to be achieved. However, as the world's most influential spokesman for freedom, the United States should participate in any attempt to end the greatest restraint upon freedom possible -hunger and all of its debilitationg effects. 
The proper avenue of requesting this type of participation is through our elected representatives. If they become aware that a large number of their constituents support American entrance into a food reserve, it is hoped that they would respond accordingly. 
Through its actions of the past week, the Hunger Coalition has been trying to engender this type of response. In light of Notre Dame's often mentioned but seldom realized official policy supporting drives such as this, our community would seem to be the best place for this type of activity to succeed. 
P.O. Box Q 
Clarification 
Needed 

Dear Editor: 
Whill' cmering the Hall Pres· dcnh Council for The Observer Tlll·-;dav night I encountered a ,ituatinn with which most of the huard arc probably familiar. but "hich for mc was a personal first. It appear., that same individuals Ill\ nh cd in student government arc l.thoring undcr certain misconccp­1iuns about their relationship with the paper. which may provoke resentment towards the staff. if not I'L'-evaluatcd. 
This difliculty tirst came to my attentinn on Tuesday night when HPC Chairman J. P. Russell im­plied that I had somehow been discourll'ous to him in my coverage of the council's meeting a week ago. by disclosing that Dean Roe­mer woul'd be invited to speak at their next meeting. (Russell had evidently been unable to contact Roemer before the paper was distributed.) I was at first surpris­ed by his statement, since I had repeatedly encouraged Russell to approach me immediatclv if he had a complaint about anv or"mv stories on the HPC. vet I had no hi.nt of his dissatisfactit;n until he announced it at Tuesday·~ meeting. After the meeting. I notitied Russell that I was not his press secretarv, and he agreed that it was his obligation to request that an item be omitted from a story, not mine to clear a stor~· with him. 
Complicating the situation wa~ an idea proposed at Tuesday's meeting to invite Fr. Burtchaell to appear at an HPC meeting some­time next semester. Russell re­quested that I omit this, and I did so not only in light of his request, but more importantly because the invitation was to be extended so far in the future that it was not particularly significant. Unfortun­ately, the absence of some mention of the invitation in my article may have given the mistaken impres­sion that Russell has some control over what appears in the paper. 
I would hope that he, and others in similar positions. would come to the realization that the paper does not exist to facilitate their work, however considerable it may be. The invitation to Dean Roemerwas given top priority because it was the most significant action under­taken at that particular meeting, and because it was pertinent to the disciplinary problem, an important campus issue. To neglect it would amount to slipshod coverage of the meeting, depriving the readers of timely information. Since I do not regard the HPC as insignificant, under no conditions could I omit the Roemer invitation from my story. If information too sensitive for public dissemination is to be the key event of a meeting. I suggest it be closed. 
Russell is aware that I have in the past omitted from my articles interesting but essentially unim­portant items. Yet he and others must realize that reporters function ultimately as representatives for the students at the events they cover and must describe what transpires from the perspective of what is of interest and importance to the university community. It was my judgement that a student who had attended that HPC meet ing a week ago would have found the Roemer invitiation to be the most important feature of that meeting. 
Reporting this may have resulted in unintentional discomfort to the HPC chairman, but if he had not assumed beforehand that the story would be written to suit his administrative duties instead of to inform the readers, he would not have experienced any difficulty. While I believe I can speak for the staff in saying we try to be courteous whenever possible, cour­tesy beyond a certain point imperils 
the  requirements  of  competent  
reporting.

Student Protection 
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii barry o'con n or 
The disturbing melee of last 
November 5th has provoked ques­
tions pertaining to the "manner" 
in which the disorder was handled. 
It comes as a shock that so few 
questions have been raised as to 
how and why such a situation could 
have occured at all! In other 
words. the decision to allow the 
dance to take place was one so 
obviously fraught with such a 
variety of risks (considering the 
peculiar conditions upon which the 
succcs!) of the affair was predi­
cated: a general invitation to the 
South Bend Community. eighteen 
and older). that it would seem to a 
competent, thoughtful decision­
maker that such an event would be 
disallowed, considering the pos­
sible. consequent derivatives of 
such an event -a state of disorder 
imperiling the lives and property of 
members of the communitv. 
We are told that the offi~c of the 
Dean of Students is responsible for 
the decision to allow the affair. It 
would seem, then. that responsi­
bility for the event rests squarely 
with the administrative apparatus. 
through the imprimatur of its Dean 
of Students. The University, acting 
through the Dean, is directly 
accountable for an event which led 
to serious violations of the rights of 
persons and property. 
Let us, then, get directly to the 
point: the Dean of Students 
demonstrated, by permitting such 
an affair to take place, a gross 
incompetence of such magnitude 
that it would not be too much to 
demand his resignation. 
Now this may seem extreme, but if one examines to the fullest the implications of the Dean's action, one might be able to understand why "moderation in the defense of .order is no virtue," to coin a phrase. Certainly we can point to the actual damages sustained by life and property --a considerable amount of injuries to persons and damages to buildings on campus, primarily to the LaFortune Student Center. But it is certainly not unfair to point to the potential damages that could so easily have occurred --permanent injury and 
even death. 
The University's own foundation 
of rule is imperiled by this singular 
act of poor judgement. The basic 
principle of the Administrative 
Order, in loco parentis, not only 
implies that the University may 
claim sovereignty in a variety of 
social and ethical spheres of indi­
vidual behavior to maintain the social (i.e .. moral) order, but also implies obligations on the part of the University to the lives and property of the members of that order; to fail to do so is to dismiss the notion of order itself. 
Indeed, security of life and property should take precedence over the secondary, but necessary, concern for moral and right be­havior. Without this parameter against chaos. there can be no order. The University (the Dean of Students) has failed in its role as the paternal guardian of the "Family." seriously jeopardizing the security of its members. No father would ever expose his children to such unnecessary danger. 
We are, it would seem, at a crossroads: either the University take appropriate action to sustai~ its own principles of communal order (and that means removing those individuals in authority who fail so miserably to maintain those principles) or it consider revising substantially those principles. 
The intention of the Dean's decision may have been praise­worthy in itself; to establish better community relations with South Bend is certainly not objectionable. But to do so at the peril of the community is simply outrageous. It is ironic that the result may have had just the opposite effect: to turn this community away from South Bend. 
But whatever his intentions, they can only serve as explanations, not excuses. We must all eventually pay for our mistakes, and this includes the Dean of Students, who never once offered so much as an apology to this community for his actions. 
Finally. let us transcend for the moment the immediate issue. One should not forget the most pro­found experience of this century in which the framework of social order is (and has been) increasingly stormed by those who would view it as oppressive and limiting. What­ever the grounds for this view, it should be remembered at this advanced stage of the human condition that the destruction of order (especially in the sense of limitation upon human action) is merely a prelude to the destruction of free society itself. 
The community must rely upon those in authority to protect it from such harm; and, at the very least, it should not expect authority to inadvertently sponsor the forces of disorder themselves. 

War of the Nerds 
Preiudices on Both Sides 
Dear Editor: 
"Name withheld" made some interesting comments about . co­education at Notre Dame. Unfor­tunately they were obscured by colorings of sarcasm and ambiguity (certainly understandable where our sexual identity is concerned). 
I would argue that the problems facing Notre Dame and coeducation must be considered in light of the average student's pre-college ex­periences. Most of us (I believe it is sixty percent) arrived on the Ad­ministration Building steps after four. in some cases even twelve, years of isolated. single-sexed, Catholic education. The "normal" high school social event was a weekend affair only. whether bas­ketball games or auditorium dances. Thus experience indicated to us that all girls hung around in groups of six, and a guy's only interest outside of sports was french kissing. 
To call ND men chauvinistic is about equivalent to calling ND women castrating bitches. It works both ways. Both labels are founded on poo~ communication and in­direct experience. There are cer­tainly prejudices on both sides because of this. 
My first year at Notre Dame, 1972. was the first year of co­education. I was humiliated by the dining hall rating squad. and I likewise humiliated some guys I felt weren't up to my 'standards'. But my accumulated experiences here have indicated to me, that most ND men are gentlemen, even if that is in an old-fashioned sense.

NERDS: Unite, Negotiate 
Dear Editor: 
I felt a sense of deja vu when I read Thursday's letter. "ND Nerds". It seems every year about this time the attack on ND males (and the counterattack on females ) becomes especially acute. Letters 
in your column fire accusations back and forth about which sex is more degenerate than the other. 
Rather than writing insulting letters. and casting aspersions on our respective genders. I propose some attempt at reconciliation be made. Why not let male and female split up into negotiating teams and engage in (Private Sector) Collect­ive Bargaining?!? Girls can repre­sent Labor (no pun intended) and present their demands and-or grievances to ND males (or NERD Management). The two groups can then sit down and draw up a contract. No more pressure on 
P.O. Box Q 
dates! No more awkward moments at parties or dances. Such items to be bargained for could include. but not be limited to: 
I) Any NERD found engaging in a Panty Raid, and in possession of "panties". shall surrender a similar article of his own 
immediately upon demand by Labor. 
2) Labor shall have the right to reject any unwarranted moves by a NERD not hitherto agreed 
upon. or included in a writ­ten contract signed by both parties. 
a) Hy the same token. NERD rc­-serves the right to with­drav. at anv time from an en­gagement. or similar com­mitment. involving per­manent relations. 
One way for Labor to reach a settlement would be to go on strike! Imagine every ND & SMC girl "boycotting" (no pun intend­ed) ND males for 30 davs! Of course. you wouldn't w~nt to overdo so~1cthing like this-it could backfire. Some members of NERD might come up with their own alternative diversions. 
I offer this solution as a gesture of "good faith" to all ND & SMC girls who feel they occupy a bottom-line position. and desire to be on top of the situation. In conclusion. I hope no misunder­standings arc construed from my suggestion. 
ND Nerd Name of Nerd withheld by request 
Un-Proven Attack 
Dear Editor: The letter referring to the male population of Notre Dame as "nerds" is in rather poor taste, and I can only feel pity for the unfortunate female who was driven to such ends. In the first place. the insults hurled upon the ND men were totally without foundation. The attack on Rick Slager was a very flimsy attempt to support the given argument and it only high­lighted the insignificant jibberish throughout the entire article. I find it hard to believe that Ms. Anon­ymous is entirely without fault, therefore incapable of making a rash statement such as the one she provided concerning Rick Slager. Her motives for putting this into the paper seem cruel and unjust. If Ms. Anonymous could not provide substantial evidence to back her opinion. she had no right to produce such an letter. The reasoning behind her conclusion appeared to be based on a very selfish emotional stance. If she felt that she could rectify the situation. she went about it in the wrong way. One does not ease tension between two sides by attacking the opposi­tion. So, Ms. Anonymous, if you cannot argue from a rational point of view, don't bother arguing at all. 
Your first attempt was humorous vet sad. and it is too bad vour sentiments arc in such a sad state.

Treat Opposite Sex as Persons 
Dear Editor: 
I am directing this letter to Ms. 
"Name withheld by request" (the 
anonvmous author of "ND males 
arc n-erds. chauvinistic"). in hope' 
t·lat she is not an alias of anvonc , 
know. I realize that this letter will 
make me vulnerable to mountains 
of criticism. but I accept that risk. 
Anvonc -male or female -who read -the aforementioned letter must have recognized the irration­ality it expressed. First!~·. the author's preoccupation with WHAT THE RATIO REALLY IS, proves nothing at all. Secondly. her description of the very same indivi­duals as "best in the nation. and their kindness. consideration. and thoughtfulness...is the greatest I've experienced". and as "most inconsiderate. dense. egotistical and chauvinistic" within one para­graph is absurd. True. any given group of persons perform different­ly when together than they do individually because peer influence brings out certain characteristics: and perhaps some men at Notre Dame act immaturclv and incon­siderate at times. However. the description in this letter is a ridiculous overstatement since no "normal" person could change so drastically under peer pressure (and yes. ND men are normal). 
Of course, there is a problem at Notre Dame--one which goes deep­er that male-female ratio or chau­vinism--and this conflict between the sexes is growing into a hostile Cold War. Both groups resent each other. BOTH group~ are guilty of "rating" and stereotyping and dehumanizing each other. 
This is a difficult time for women due to the vast and rapid changes in social expectancies and attitudes toward women. Women don't really know how to act: we want to be thought of as PERSONS and not as "Grade A (or B) Beef." We want to be given certain rights. yet we enjoy being treated specially. 
Men. in turn. do not know how to act toward us. We still expect them to ask us out. and they usually pay; yet. they arcn 't sure we want them to be chivalrous. And, since they pay. we feel that to go out with someone we must be "sexually interested" in them and can't juit go out to have a good time. 
This whole series of problems leads to fear and animosity be­tween the sexes. Both sides have 
their own double standards and both sides have their own griev­ances. But, letters such as "ND males are nerds" are not going to raise either side's esteem or con­cern for tfte other! If people could only start interrelating as persons

Rather. at Notrt' Dame. the women arc somewhat pampered. Finally. I invite that ignorant wirtt·r to takl• a look at the real world before she degrades one of the few remaining monuments of old­fashioned chauvanism (formerly called etiquette and-or courtesy).

Michael  Moflit  documents  this  in  an  
cxtrcmclv  important  article  entitled  

"Bread and Radical Change". He offers a critique of Lester Brown's position. and in... ish on the importance of understanding the l''>'>L'Ill'l' of a social svstcm, what makes the wheels of the systcni turn. He'' rites: 
Hclations between the advanced and under-developed countries ha\t' assumed a varil.'ly of forms during the past live or six centuries hut the substance of the rl'lation­'>hip has always remained the same: the poor countries have made indispensihk contributions to the accumulation of wealth (capital) in the developed wuntries while their mn1 societies have prot'L'l'ded to sink deeper into rclatin· po\'crt~· and under-devel­opmt·nt. This. I a'>scrt, ha'> been thL· drhing force of relations bc­tWL'L'n Brown's "rich" and "poor" countrit's since the da\\·n of West­ern colonialism and there is no n·a..,on to believe that. gi,·en the absence of ha'>ic '>trut·tural (i.e .. ..,,.,tcmatil'l change'> in both the undndcvl'lopcd and the advanced countries, things will hL' anv differ· t•nt in the ncar future. 
Moffit goes 011 to document the growing ineljualitv between the rich and poor countries. At the beginning of this centur\·, for example. the per capita income of persons in the undcr-devtloped countries was one. half the per capita income of people in the rich countries; but 
The Doobies at the ACC 
IPhotos by J<~net Carnev I 
Two n·ar'> ago, the Doobic Brothers came to the ACC and played two hours of the loud, melodic tunes that have become their stable. 
The -.amc could have been expected Saturdav night. and why not? The Doohic's high-t·hargcd concerts arc wild!~· popular. and fun to boot. In this year's two hour performance. the last forty minutes were dominiatcd hv the old favorites that mo'>t of the crowd ~·ame to hear. But the Doohit''> also showed they're willing to c:-.capt' from a proven formula to try ...oml'lhing new and tilled the first part of the ..,how with cver~·thing ranging from piano and guitar solos to ragtime buies to Steeh Dan-intluenccd instrumentals. 
Ih~· near-t·;,pacity crowd should have hct·n readv for something different the nH>111L'Ilt the "arm-up hand hit the stage. After an hour dl'ia\· caused by equipment prohll'm'>. Flo and Eddie gave a strangL', hilaritllls. \Tt alway-. entertaining hour­long -.ct. 
These t\\O rot·k n' roll veterans combined their own m;1tcrial with that of their JILT' itllh carL'L'r'> with the Turtles and the Motht'f'> of lnH'ntion (Something like John lkm cr pia~ ing with Pink Floyd). Their old rurtll' hih, indud!ng "Elenor" and "Hap­py Together", were not dated at all: it was refreshing to hear such excellent vocals. 
Next h; the old Turtle hits. the focal point of their set were a couple of irreverent, raucous and hilarious musical skits. Pnhaps the funniest was a routine that ,111m cd how certain groups would do ,·ommt·ricials. Included were the Rolling Stnm·s for .lack-In-The-Box and Fleetwood MaL· (cnmpll'tt· with Stevie Nicks imitation) for (what else'!!) McDonalds. 
Alter twenty minutes of equipment mnving. the Doobies opened their set with "China Grove" and "Takin' It To The Streets," both of which got the crowd on their feet. Instead of continuing with the hits though, the San Francisco-based band proceeded to play a lot of medium -and slow -tempn numbers off their latest album, Taken' It To the Streets. Michael 
McDonald's "It keeps You Runnin"  was  
particulary well done.  
McDonald  and  lead  guitarist  Jeff  

"Skunk" Baxter, two ex-Steely Dan mem­bers. seem somewhat responsible for the group's expansion into other areas of rock. 
bv I 970, their incomes were one-twentieth 
oi· the income of persons living in the 
advanced countries. And much of this 
growing income disparity comes about, 
Moflit insists, "not as Brown would have 
us believe, as a result of population 
growth, hut because of the penetration of 
underdeveloped economies by multination­
al corporations.'' 

In a recent address, Pope Paul pointed 
out the danger of multi-national corpora­
tions taht concentrate means and power in 
the hands of a small number of persons. 
"These private organizations." he said, 
"can lead to a new and abusive form of 
domination on the social. cultural and even 
political level." 

How prophetic he was. For example. the lirst global corporation investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission was United Brands, the food conglomerate and owner of the United Fruit banana empire in Central America. Eli Black. its board chairman, committed suicide early last ~Tar. At the time, investigators did not realize what had driven him to despair. Now it has been disclosed that Black had arranged to pay $1.25 million as a bribe to the economic minister of Honduras in order to have the banana export tax lowered. 
Archbishop Carter -of Canada. speaking at the Roman Svnod, stated: "The historv of foreign corp~rations operating in weak nations is replete with unjusticc, with prolits and loyalt~· to their own country taking priority over the needs and aspira­tions of local people." 
Focusing closer to home. the American bi'>hops have released an important study that views poverty in the US from an institutional point of view; that is, as caused primarily by economic decisions 
With the absence of ex-lead guitarist and main songwriter Tom Johnston. these two have forced the Doobies to keep the energy level of their earlier efforts. yet also make their music a little more complex. There were quite a few examples of this on Saturday night, along with numerous instrumental interludes between songs. Once Baxter did a pleasant solo acoustic guitar, while McDonald did the same on the piano. This would've been unheard of at their concert of two years ago. 
But the most obvious and surprising addition to the show was the presence of the Memphis Horns, a solid collection of three sax players, a trumpetP.r and a 
made in-terms of efficiency and profit, decisions that the poor are politically powerless to influence. Here are some of the disconcerting observations the bishops made: I) Poor people arc often caught in a trap and then blamed for being; 2) there just arc not enough decent jobs available for all those who want to work; 3) only three states offer welfare payments equal to the government poverty level; 4) the average American can no longer afford the average American home; 5) the richest tenth receive more in total income each year than the whole bottom half of the population; 6) in a concentrated economy. the producers often cut production. lay off workers and raise prices simultaneously while maintaining per unit profits. 
The poor of this country (and it's no sheer coincidence that so many of them are black) arc trapped and cornered, victimiz­ed bv the rich. dehumanized bv a svstem that ·inherently prevents a re~l p~litical democracy. They arc victims of a gross inequality that is contrary to the teachings of Jesus and what can be tolerated by his true followers. 
There is a chilling line in the gospel: "Teacher. tell my brother to give me a share of our inheritance." How many millions arc saying precisely that about us today! Those who mine tin in Bolivia and copper in Chile. Those who harvest our coffee in Brazil; the families who pick our food from the fields. where they are merely "migrants". All of these people. and many more, arc asking today, and sometimes demanding. to share in God's creation. They would have us remember that this is Thanksgiving. "Teacher, tell my brother to give me a share of our inheritance." 
Gregg Bangs 

trombonist. On quite a number of older songs. a sax or trumpet solo would replace a guitar run. Old Doobie fans might've been dismayed, but the Horns added new twists to some old tunes that made them just as attractive. 
The best example of this innovation was Patick Simmons' "Black Water." The song started off wit the familiar acoustic guitar, but by the time it hit the part about "Dixieland,·· the horns were playing a funky ragtime beat that sounded straight out of New Orleans. It was one of the hight points of the show. 
However, the Doobies haven't forgotten what got them their paychecks. Right after "Black Water", they ripped inot a collec­tion of their older hits, including "Rockin' down the Highway", "Jesus is Just Alright" and "Long Train Runnin'." For an encore, replete with scattered light rays ( what the heck is the name of thatthingthat that makes those artificial "cosmic rays" anyway?), the Doobies kept up the torrid, hard-rockin' pace with "Without You". Flo and Eddie and the Memphis Horns jointed in for a rousing "Listen to the Music", which has to be the Doobie's theme song. 
The Doobies could've gone the route of the Beach Boys and Chicago and just played their hits. Instead, they countereds with a little experimentation and diversity, actually making the old hits seem even better. In all, the Doobies, Flo and Eddie and the Memphis Horns gave a refreshing three hour show. And it was fun to boot.

Despite gaining a weekend split with the Michigan Tech Huskies at the A.C.C., all is not well for the Notre Dame hockey team. The superlative effort put forth by the Irish in Saturday night's 6-2 victory does not erase the numerous defensive lapses and lackluster play that highlighted Friday night's 5-3 loss. 
What it boils down to is that splits do no good in the WCHA. and the Irish have always had trouble sweeping series. Their record now stands at 3-5 and as they prepare to travel to Badger countrv for a weekend series with highly-touted Wisconsin next week.memories of last year's .500 season must abound. 
On Friday night, the Huskies gave the Irish a valuable lesson in how to skate and foreeheck. Two early·goals by Tech junior center 
[continued from page 8] 
The Nittany Lions are 7-3 so far this season and must still play number one ranked Pittsburgh this Friday. The Irish (8-2) will travel to Los Angeles to take on USC. 
The Gator Bowl clash between the two schools will not mark the first time they have met. The schools have met four times pre­viously. the last occasion being in 1928. with Penn St. never having deeated the Irish. The series stands at 3-0-1 in favor of Notre Dame. 
"I want to do what our team wants to do.·· Devine acknowled­ged. "They've worked so hard·and Chris Ferguson put the Irish be­hind quickly in the first period. However, Brian Walsh, one of the few Irish standouts Friday, tallied from the slot on the power play to cut the Tech lead to 2-1 after one period. 
Irish goalie Len Moher played an excellent game with little defensive support and he was quickly put to the test in the second period. Freshman Gord Salt was dragged down from behind by Terry Fair­holm as he broke in alone on Moher resulting in the season's first penalty shot. Salt took his time on the approach and Moher was able to cut the angle down and make a sliding save. 
That seemed to fire the Irish up momentarily and freshman Greg Meredith scored to tie the game at 2-2. Then came the amazing defensive breakdown by the Irish that resulted in three Tech goals in the space of three minutes. First. left wilig Dana Decker stole an Irish 
Orange Bowl in order to play a higher ranked team and insure their chance for the national title. If Pitt should falter against Penn St. on Nov. 26 or Georgia in New Orleans. the winner of the Rose Bowl will probably claim national crown. 
In Dallas on New Year's day, Maryland ( 11-0) will meet the SWC champion in the Cotton Bowl. Houston will probably be Mary­land's opponent in the contest; thcv defeated fifth-rated Texas Te~h 27-19 last Saturdav and only need to win over Rice thfs weekend clearing pass and fired a shot from the slot past Moher to make it 3-2. Lou Drazenovich followed with a slap shot that slipped between Moher's pads and Stu Younger tipped home a shot from Jeff Wilcox for a 5-2 Tech advantage. 
Only the superb effort of Moher prevented the score from being higher as Tech continued to bom­bard him with repeated 2-on-1 and 3-on-1 breaks for the remainder of the period. 
Notre Dame rallied in the third period as they kept the play in the Tech zone for the majority of the period. Yet. they could manage only one score, that being an unassisted goal by Don Fairholm. Huskic goalie Bruce Horsch was outstanding in the third period, posting 18 saves. 
On Saturday night. the Irish came out looking like a different hockey team. The roles were reversed with the .Irish forwards forechccking well and keeping the 
The Bruins were denied a trip to the Rose Bowl this past weekend. losing to USC 24-14; they will give the Crimson Tide and the Liberty Bowl fans quite a game in Mem­phis. 
On Dec. 25. Wyoming (8-3) and Oklahoma (7-2-1) will clash in the Fiesta Bowl. The Tempe. Arizona contest just doesn't have the attraction that last vear's Arizona St. -Nebraska battI~ had. Last year's game found the Sun Devils proving that the WAC could com­pete witht the big boys. 
The Peach Bowl will pit North pressure on Tech. The play resulted in a hooking penalty on Stu Ostlund which the Irish con­verted into Kevin Nugent's first goal of the season. Nugent tipped home a shot from the point by Jack Brownschidle. 
For the final ten minutes of the period the Irish seemed to be slipping into the sloppy pattern of the previous night. Tech took advantage of that as Rodger Mo~· scored on a breakaway to even the score. The goal came on the lri~h power play as Stu Younger took the puck at the point and hit Mo~· witha a beautiful pa~s at the lri~h blue line. 
In the second period. the Irish kept the play awa~· from John Peterson as Tech could manage only eight shots on goal. Paul Clarke broke the tie at the halfway mark of the period with a beautiful rising slap shot from the point ton the Irish powe-r play. Ray Johnson

'>0 nran~· factors involved. The Irish's offense was being directed by an 
inl'Xpcricm·cd quarterback. Seniors were playing their last home game in 
their Notrl' Dame careers. Bowl offers lingered behind the game. Miami 
looked like a bunch of old windbags in the first half and came back as a 
Hurricanl' after intermission. 
The lri~h couldn't have met a more charitable opponent than Miami if 
thl'\ \\Tnt out and played the twelve discip_les. The Hurricane did 
l'\'L'r\'thing except role ovl'r and play dead in the first half as they fumbled 
four timt''> and Wl'rl' intercepted once (eight turnovers in the game). One 
alnw'>l had to feel sorr~-for quarterback E.J. Baker as Miami receivers 
acted a'> if thl' ball was poison. Baker was very accurate as he bounced 
pa.,~,-~ otT his rccci\'l'r'> hands. heads. stomachs and chests. When Miami 
r,·,·cin·r., caught thl' ball they munificently handed it over after running a 
few \·ard'>. 
Tliis is not to take an~·thing away from Rusty Lisch who performed ouhtandingly in his first starting assignment. Lisch simply took advantagl' of Miami's generosity and led the offense to its second highest <,coring output of the season. His perfect touchdown pass to Dan Kelleher down the .,idl'iines and hi., eight yard run for a score are example.s of Li~ch·., taknt in both facets of the game. Lisch has made himself a prime l'Oiltl'ndcr for the number one quartl•rback spot next season. 
Once again Dan Kelleher and AI Hunter led the passing and running 
attarks rcspcrtivcly. Kelleher's three catches for 68 yards gives him a 
22 ..'> ~-anh average pl'r reception. At this rate he will set a school record in thi., ratcgorv. Sincl' the Navy game. this senior has budded into a star and will he sorcl\' missed next year. 
AI Hunter has proved ·that he can run with the best of them. Congratulation., mu'>t be offered to this all purpose back who now owns Notre Datm· ·., single season rushing record. Adding the 128 yards he at'l'umulall'd against Miami to his pre-game total of 815, Hunter needs onil S-:' \'<ll'lh to become the first Notre Damer to run for over 1000 yards in a '>ingk '>l'a.,on. 
Another congratulations should go to the offense who shook the second halt blul'~ and linall\ scored a touchdown in the third quarter. One must '' ondcr if the kickoff team wa~ so overcome by this feat that they forgot to ta,·kk Miami'., returner on the ensuing kickoff. 
lhl' secondar_v looked ver~' weak in the second half allowing 20 l'l'l't'ption~ throughout the gaml' with most coming after halftime (three for touchdm< n'>). The total would have been much higher if Miami had not dropped a half a dol.l'n cas~-passes. A slight let-up is understandable after a 23-0 halftime-lead but the Irish seem to make little or no ad_ju.,t mcnts during intermission The team seems to be too predictable during the set·ond half. 
**************** 
The "Outstanding Senior Reserve Lineman" of the game goes to Tony Zappala. "Zap" substituting for injured Willie Fry (broken nose) kept the pressure on Miami's Baker throughout the afternoon. Zappala was the main reason Miami ended up 4th and 48 in a third quarter series of plays. This senior seemed to represent all those players that arc not recognized because they don't start but have worked equally hard and contribute greatly in their four years at Notre Dame. 
**************** 
The Irish are now Gator Bowl bound. Some fans will complain about only making a minor bowl and having to play Penn State. The Irish got what they earned. At least the players didn't make the same mistake they made last year by declining an offer to a million dollar bowl. 
The Irish's real bowl game will be played next week in the Coliseum. It will take two strong halves from the offense and defense to come out with a win. Southern Cal will make Notre Dame earn everything they get (unlike this week). If miracles still exist, then Penn St. could beat an untested Pittsburgh and Notre Dame could upset a team with roses on their mind. This would set up a more attractive bowl game. Well there is always hope ...
