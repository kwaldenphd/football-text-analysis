United States may moderate its 
tactics order not to ''get too far in 
front of the allies." 
The question is whether to cite 
countries and cases by name when 
reviewing implementation of the 
1975 Helsinki accords. 
The accords, signed at a summit 
meeting in the Finnish capital by 
the United States, the Soviet 
influence in Eastern Europe in 
exchange for what the West views 
as promises of greater human 
rights in the Communist countries. 
The United States came to the Belgrade follow-up conference pre­pared to document 1 ,500 cases involving a total of 5,000 persons who had been blocked from joining relatives in the West in alleged violations of the accords on family unification, the sources said. 
But its allies in the North Atlantic alliance . are said to fear that naming names will provoke harsh reaction and be counterpro­ductive if any commitments from the East Bloc are to be gained. 
U.S. restraint would have three aims, the sources reported: to preserve allied unity, to avoid a confrontation with the Soviets so a full review can be carried out, and 
to ensure that further review 
conferences can be held after 
Belgrade in order to keep pressure 
on the East. 
So far, the United States has 
directly criticized the Soviet Union 
only once during the two-week old 
conference, accusing it of tamper­
ing with mail from the West. 
West Germany on Monday men­
tioned high exit visa fees in the 
Soviet Union, Bulgaria and Poland 
and complained that East Germany 
was blocking cased of families 
seeking to be reunited. 
In concert with its 14 NATO allies, however, the United States is still undecided at what point it would single out specific cases and countries. Some countries have proposed this be done ''in response to attacks" from the east, the sources said. 
U.S. officials emphasize that differences among the allies aren't serious and only concern degree on tactics. 
Nevertheless, one source de­scribed Goldberg as an ''isolated figure" among the NATO delega­tion chiefs, with virtually every NATO country insisting the West take a more cautious approach.

United Way campaign pushes over halfway mark 
by Mike Villani Staff Reporter This years United Way campaign has reached 59.2 percent of their 
2.5 million dollar goal according to General Campaign Chairman Dr. George M. Haley. 
Division chairmen reports total­led $1,330,902 as of Thursday, Oct. 13 Haley said. His address at the general report meeting last week called for intense volunteer effort£ because, according to Haley, "the next final two weeks are crucial for meeting our goal.'' Haley urged the volunteers to get their reports in so the pledges can be counted. 
According to Professor Charles Wilbur, Universtiy director of United Way, "the total University volunteer effort into the campaign was phenomenal and beyond what was expected." As of last Thurs­day, the combined effort of stu­dents, staff, faculty and adminis­trators totaled $32,000 stated Wilbur. 
The breakdown was as follows: students, $2500 (presently $4600); faculty,$15 thousand; administra­tors, $7500; and staff $7 thousand. Figure updates will be available tomorrow and reported after Oct. break.

Body of coed found 
MARTINSVILLE, Ind. [AP] -A badly decomposed body found in a cornfield was tentatively identified yesterday as that of missing Indi­ana University coed Ann Louise Harmeier, authorities said. 
Positive identification awaited a check of fmgerprints and dental records. 
The 20-year old Miss Harmeier has been missing more than five weeks, her disappearance trigger­ing a nation-wide search and an outpouring of time, concern and money from her hometown, the small eastern Indiana community of Cambridge City. 
The body was found in mid­afternoon by a farmer harvesting corn about five miles from Miss Harmeier disappeared along Indi­ana 37 two miles north of here Sept. 12. 
Morgan County Coroner James Summers said the body was that of a female about 20 years old and appeared to have been in the field about five weeks. 
Police said the clothing at the scene -a red shirt, jeans and tennis shoes -matched the description of what Miss Harmeier was wearing when last seen. 
State troopers also said a purse found next to the body contained a paper with Miss Harmeier' s name on it and jewelry and other items known to belong to the coed. 
. A police chaplain and minister were staying with Miss Harmeier's mother, Marjorie Harmeier, in Cambridge City, authorities said.

play, Summers said, "We couldn't tell because the body was so badly decomposed." 
State police investigators, how­ever, said they found a shoe string and a hairbrush around the young woman's neck, leading them to believe she might have been strangled. 
Summers said the body will be taken to Indianapolis for an autopsy to determine the cause of death. 
The farmer, Lawrence Stafford, said he was working in the field about seven miles northeast of Martinsville. 
"I was just going along picking corn and ran on the body laying there between two rows," Stafford said. 
He said his children often ride motorbikes through the area and a recently as Monday, his small son, Jim, rode within ten feet of where the body was found and noticed nothing. 
When the body was first found, State Police Maj. Stan Kenney said it was unknown whether it was male or female, but he added, "Of course, we're kind of assuming it's Ann." 
Crime lab technicians were dis­patched to the scene from two state police posts to aid in identification, Kenny said. 
Miss Harmeier, 20, has been missing since Sept. 12, when her disabled car, with its emergency lights blinking, was found abandoned along the same stretch of Indiana 37. She was returning to IU's Bloomington campus from her home in Cambridge City when she disappeared.

to illustrate the sudden domin­ance of landscape, Porter showed a slide of Claude Lorrain's "Rest on the flight into Egypt" in which the Holy Family is pictured in the foreground of a detailed forest setting. "Figures began to play subordinate roles to the grandness of the landscape and atmospheric perspective," he noted. 
18th century landscapes fell into two rough categories, Porter stated. Stylized portraits contained flat, tapestry-like backgrounds, and idyllic. fantasy settings por­trayed "the poet's vision of what landscape might be, not the earthly realism," he remarked. 
19th century French artists are credited with painting pure land­scapes such as those done of St. 

Cloud Park outside Paris. "They were concerned with the qualities that light gives to trees and mountains, looking at the land­scape for its inherent qualities, not another level of meaning," Porter explained. 
He concluded by inviting the audience back to the gallery to view the actual paintings of which many of the slides were taken. "You'll find the images themselves quite exciting, not only as slides, but in real life," he stressed. 
Porter created the program last year to expand interest in the gallery. Each month, a member of the Notre Dame art department will give a slide presentation or lecture demonstration of a general art topic during the noon hour. University staff members are mvited to bring their lunches while they obset ve the program. 
Porter explained his motivation for continuing the program, sta­ting, "too many people go to work from eight to five with their only benetit being a paycheck. There should be other benetits, especially at a university." He described the gallery as another service the University can offer to its employ­ees. 
Several secretaries agreed with the purpose of the program. "I know so little about art, anything I can get here helps out," one woman commented. Another sec­retary added,  'They never stopped the program once they started it, so they must have realized there was a need for it.'' 

Splat spitter suffers second loss 
BLOOMFIELD* Ky. (AP)-Mike Hahn stood and watched with a jaw plugged full of tobacco and squared in confidence as spitter after spitter tried and failed to better his 21 foot effort. 
Marion D. Creech, 39, held the early lead with a 21 footer in the Bloomfield Tobacco Festival Spit­tin' Contest over the weekend but suffered a "splat" on this third try and knew it was all over. 
A "splat" occurs when the expectorant fails to measure as large as a quarter when it lands on the plastic mat on which distances are outlined. Spitters score a zero for a "splat" or when they lose the chaw and it dribbles down their chin, contest official Don Wells said. 
"I've been trying this for four years," the disappointed Creech said as he watched the 15 year old Hahn collecting the gold-plated championship spittoon for the sec­ond straight year. Creech was also given a smaller gold spittoon for being runnerup. 
"My daddy, cousin .. everybody in my family just about chews," 

Hahn said. "I've been chewing a 
few  years  I reckon.  Our  whole  
softball team chews.  It's nothing  
new around here."  


It wasn't as if Hahn didn't have plenty of competition as past 
champion VictorCoulter of Taylors­ville was among those taking his puckers. Coulter, however, had a bad day and his best effort was just 16 feet. 
Hahn's victory spit was a festival record, bettering his 1976 record spit of 18 feet, but well shy of the world's mark.

Over a hundred people assem­bled last night in Carrol Hall in Madeleva for an hour and a half lecture on "World Protein Shor­tage." Gerald Elkan, an assistant dean for research and a professor of microbiology at North Carolina State University, was the guest speaker. 
A major problem confronting the food shortage is a high birthrate in underdeveloped nations. "The disaster is that we're not increasing our productivity at the same rate as the population," stated Elkhan. "Most of the world never sees meat. Grain is the most common edible protein--and two-thirds of the world are deficient in it," continued Elkan. 
With the use of slides, Elkan also explained how the scarcity and costliness of fertilizers and sources of energy have added to the crisis. Crop-producing lands are also decreasing, due to growing cities and towns. Elkan emphasized, "In the last fifteen years we've created 3 per cent more desert lands from total world land." 
The best immediate solution to increase food supplies, continued Elkan, is to produce 'synthetic proteins' and raise more legumes (pod-bearing plants, such as peas and beans, that enrich the soil as they grow). 
"Right now there are 8 billion people on the earth," he stressed. "By the year 2020 there's going to be 12 billion people. Years from now you're going to have to feed those people, so you should become concerned now. You people are going to be the decision­makers. Heaven help us!" he added jokingly. 
Students were invited to stay for a brief question and answer session at the conclusion of the lecture. 
Elkan, a noted scientist, has many honors and awards to his credit, and is currently working on the problem of world hunger.

Simple churc~ ceremony pays tribute to ~inger Bing Crosby. _ 
LOS ANGELES [AP]-Bing Crosby was buried in a misty hillside cemetery yesterday after a simple church service that began with the strains of such Crosby hits as "The Bells of St. Mary's" and "Too-RA-Loo-Ra-Loo-Ral, That's an Irish Lullaby." 
The Mass of the Resurrection was held in predawn darkness to avoid a crush of fans seeking to pay last tribute to one of the world's most famous entertainers, who died of a heart attack Friday in · Spain at age 73. 
About 35 relatives and asso­dates, including Crosby's close friend Bob Hope, attended the 6 
Rigged explosion k.,, b 
I s USinessman 
EVANSVILLE,Ind. (AP1 
A wealthy city businessman died yesterday when his car exploded in 
. the parking lot of an eastside health spa. authorities said. 
Ray Ryan, 72, was apparently killed by professionals who rigged a bomb to the car, said Frank Cook, a local officer of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms He said there were no immediate suspects in the case. 
The window shattering explosion happened just after Ryan finished a two-hour workout at the Olympia Health and Beauty Resort, Cook 
, said. Ryan, who became a million­aire in the 1930's as owner of the Ryan Oil Co., was dead on arrival at St. Mary's Hospital. 
Cook said the bomb was large and attached to the front of the car, but he did not know what explosive was used or how it was detonated. The health spa's owner told officers that Ryan joined about three months ago but visited the spa irregularly. 
Ryan was pulled from the burning car by an employee of a neighboring auto-parts store who told police he heard the explosion 
and saw the flames, Cook said. 
Besides his oil interests, Ryan owned hotels in several states and the Mount Kenya Safari Club in East Africa. 
In 1970, a California judge sentenced Ryan to three years in prison and fined him $3,000 for allegedly altering the club's membership records, but he won acquittal in Dec. 17, 1971. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in Los Angeles ruled then that there was insufficient evidence to support conviction.

There were no fans outside on 
the foggy streets. 
When he lived at Holmby Hills, 
Crosby worshipped at the Spanish 
mission style church. The quiet 
service there was in response to his 
wish for a simple funeral and 
burial. 
Crosby's body, resting in an oak 
casket topped by a blanket of Sonia 
roses, was buried near a stone 
grotto in Holy Cross Cemetary 
beside his parents and first wife, 
Dixie Lee, who died of cancer in 
1952. 
The roses were the only adorn­
ment for the brief graveside cere­
mony, but carloads of flowers 
arrived later from admirers around 
the world. 
The cemetary, in suburban Cui­-very city, is not far from Metro-Go!­
Crosby's widow, -Kathryn, led a responsive reading. 
"I think he died a contented man," Crosby's. son, Phillip, said after the service. "He accomp­lished everything he set out to do, but he had a lot more to give. We lost him early." 
Mrs. Crosby, her face steeled, 
,entered the chapel 20 minutes before the service with her children Harry, 19, Nathaniel,15, and Mary Frances, 17. Also present were Crosby's sons by his first marriage, Gary, Dennis, Phillip and Lindsay; his brother Bob Crosby, and his sister, Mary Rose Pool. His six sons were pallbearers. 
Other mourners included such show business companions as Bob Hope and his wife, Dolores; Rose­mary Clooney, who sang with Crosy in his final concerts and comedian Phil Harris. Some of Crosby's business associates, fish­

. Sexist attitudes and stereotypes 
Dear Editor: 
In regards to the moratorium 
imposed upon the N.D./S.M.C. 
calender, as a female at Notre 
Dame, I have the following 
statements to make. 
First of all, with all the contro­
versy over the stereotypical sex­
roles and sexist attitudes of today, 
one would think by posing for the 
calender that I endorsed these 
female stereotypes; i.e. coy, 
flirtatous, vain, seductive, and dependent. Quite the contrary is 
true. 

The calender presented healthy, uninhibited, and individualistic women who felt comfortable with themselves and appearances. To ban such a form of expression of oneself is a true threat to one's freedom as an individual. 
This discrimination is indeed frustrating, especially in this case, when the calendar was presented . in such a tasteful and nonsexist manner. When will we ever respect women for who they are as individuals rather than always trying to see them as sex objects? 
A Calender Girl 
Enthusiasm IS 
no excuse 
Deu Students: 

I have slept where you present­ly sleep; I have eaten where you presently eat on the Notre Dame campus; I have attended classes in the same classrooms in which you participate, and I have also sat as part of the student body at home football games, the same as you. 
In attending the Michigan State football game, I came away a little embarassed in behalf of the football team. My feelings were much the same as many of those who sat around us in the season ticket section, most of whom I believe were also alumni. 
Notre Dame stands for sports­manship which we have every right to believe will be exemplified to the fullest by those who participate in a given sport on the field. It certainly was exemplified by our football team. Sportsmanship should not, however be excused or be replaced by enthusiasm. Enthusiasm should not be a substitute for sportsman­ship or be a reason why it is not practiced. The enthusiasm of the student body is important to thpse who participate in any sport, but when that enthusiasm reaches the boundaries of unsportsmanlike conduct, then that enthusiasm should be restrained. So it was in many of our opinions that the student body, through excessive enthusiasm, participated in unsportsmanlike conduct in not permitting the players on the field, who after all must decide the outcome of any contest, the oppor­tunity to function to their fullest. 
It is in behalf of the alumni of Notre Dame that I would hope the students will in the future show the good sportsmanship they expect from the football players them­selves.

Where Lies the Heart? 
Dear Editor: 
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii___. david cwi k , 
One of the more intriguing phenomena of our decade is the proliferation of popular books which attempt to tell you how to go about understanding yourself. Almost every bookstore carries titles such as How To Win Friends and Influence People; I'M OK* YOU'RE OK, and You Are Your Own Best Friend. The usual 
' conclusion of these books is that you understand yourself by learning to love yourself. Preoccupation with 'finding yourself, however, results from modern man's ego. The old gods having gone into decline the Self is the new God. God, Nature, Humanity, even Society have been c!iscarded. As an example, Walt Whitman's "Song of Myself' blithely states'; 
I celebrate myself and sing myself I know I am august. I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be under­stood..... . 
I will effuse egoism and show 
it underlying all. 

The result of our apotheosis of ego is however a misdirection of the heart. 
Certain expressions such as "self­realization" and "self-fullfillment" are familiar illustrations of this 
trend. b contemporary times certain similar new expressions have gained currency. We hear about "respect for personality"; 
respect for "self-activity"; respect for "self-study." We learn that the first thing a man has to do before 
attempting anything is to ''find himself." We are told that "self-acceptance" is a necessary 
precondition to character. That a man dare not let anything interfere with his self-acceptance. 
An example of this doctrine of centrality of self is Erich Fromm's 
·­
Our obligations to care for the poor of our city are never totally met with contributions plunked in cans outstretched from solicitors. 
Rather, each student was asked to contribute a dollar--that's where we were united. The generosity of those who contributed more was 
greatly appreciated but did not suffice for those who chose not to contribute. Participation was our 
goal. In light of past years experience with this drive, we certainly reached that. Student Body, you were great! 
Another purpose in writing this letter is to publically thank so many students who worked exceedingly hard to make the campaign a 
success. First among those is J.P. Russell. A good man. He worked hard and has left a valuable contribution for United Way in the 
future on this campus. Thanks as well to Marti Hogan, the reporters, the night editor, all The Observer 
for being so gracious and sup­portive in the drive. Thanks to the Ombudsman, Michelle Renaldo  
and Robin Lavender, the Hall Presidents' Council, the Community Service Commissioners, and especially those men and women troopers who actually went door to door soliciting for the poor. 
Many in the community knew the results when funding for Logan was cut. They also knew the delight in having those monies reinstated-­
the result, the hurting being cared for again. Notre Dame Student Body, you cared again and gave of your resources. With privilege and honor we thank you for the poor.

nature of Human sexuality. I agree finds that the real trouble with with Jung and Mayer that there are most alledgedly selfish persons is, feminine and masculine "parts" or not that they love themselves too ,  characteristics'' in everyone'smuch, but that they do not love personality. I think though, eventhemselves enough. 
Freud had to say, that sex identityThe result of this apotheosis of the is acquired, and Ann Oakley finds 
evidence for this in her book, Sex, 
Gender 1111d Society. I had to 
answer Mr. Cwik rationally: an 
appeal to the emotions would just 
be sinking to his level. And I feel 
that saying sex identity is a "gift," 
as Mr. Mayer does, may be too vague, and may tend to ignore what we do in fact know about sex identity. 
Yes, we have all avoided Thomas Jefferson in our arguments, so lets be less "cavalier" and say that civil rights are "unalienable" as it is said in the Declaration of Independence; that men are endowed "by their creator" with civil rights; that no man, Cwik, Merman or Mayer has the right to take these rights away, and that not even the majority can vote to take away these rights. We may be 
Christians, but we have no "God­given right" to deny anyone their rights under the Constitution-
rights which include religious freedom, as stated in the First Amendment. 
Mr. Cwik's "unnatural" argument falls apart in the light of truth, his freedom "argument" is 
nearly un-American. Sorry for not reminding everyone that they have both feminine and masculine traits, 
Mr. Mayer, and I will try to find and read "The Kingdom of the Blind". I have not read it before. 
But I still feel parents should feel 
responsible for their children, and 
that sex identity is not a vague 
"gift"; that would get too many "bad guys" off the hook. Patrick W. Merman

From the Golden Dome to the Golden Gate 

A. Senior's Guide to San Francisco 
THE CITY 

San Francisco is Fisherman's Wharf, the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz Island, North Beach, Twin Peaks, Nob Hill, Chinatown, the Marina, Golden Gate Park, St. Mary's Cathedral, the BART system, the Embaca­dero and more. San Francisco is Spanish, meaning "St. Francis," the patron saint of the city. He was born John Bernardone in 1182 at Assisi, Italy, the son of a wealthy merchant who early changed his name from John to Francisco. On April15, 1850, San Francisco was incorporated as a city, by an act of the legislature.

The loveliness of Paris I left my heart in San Francisco Seems some-how sadly gay. 
High on a hill, it calls to me.

The Cable Cars: San Francisco's National Landmark 
"San Francisco withouf'its cable cars would be like a kid' without ~i!' yo-yo."-­Phil Baker · 
Andrew. Smith Hallidie developed his system of cable roads now in use in this city in 1873. The first trial run of his dummy was down the Clay Street Hill 'between Jones and Kearny, a distance of 2,880 feet on August 2, 1873. Later the same day, the dummy with a car attached, made another · round trip, this time with a large crowd in attendance. There were many changes and alterations made to the system before complete success crowned Mr. Hallidie's efforts, and the public received the cable car with open arms. 
In 1881 at the San Francisco Industrial Exhibition the Honorable W~-Morrow stated, " ...what a revolution it (the cable car) has made in the mode of transporting passengers in this city! The hills have fallen down before it, and they are now even more accessible, and certainly more desirable for residence than the level portions of the city." 
The cable cars were made a National Historic Landmark on October 1, 1964.

Rectors consider effects of j-board proposal 
[Continued from page 1] 
representative of the hall." 
In general, Pedi felt the stress on 
the hall j-board in the SLC proposal 
shows that there is a concern for 
student involvement in the discipli­
nary process. . 
The importance of the attttude of 
the rector was stressed by Fr. 
Thomas Tallarida, Zahm Hall rec­
tor. He pointed out that the rector 
would be the executor of j-board 
decisions, and said he felt that the 
proposal basically does not greatly 
change the situation. 
The confidentiality of the j-board 
proceedings is important, accord­
ing to Tallarida. "It has to be done 
with decorum and secrecy," he 
said. "I do fear the marijuana 
jurisdiction if it gets spread all over 
the hall that so-and-so uses pot." 
"It-will not effect this hall," 
Tallarida said of the proposal. 
Cases are generally handled by the 
staff, he said. "Students aren't 
afraid of the staff,'' he added. 
Fr. James Riehle, Pangborn 
rector, said that the j-board in 
Pangborn has never handled a 
case, to his knowledge. "We have 
a j-board in name only," he said, 
explaining that there are very 
rarely any violations of hall rules. 
"I can't really get excited about the 
hall changes being proposed," he 
commented, noting that there is no 
strong sentiment in the hall for an 
active i-board. "Nobody's been

did not say that. That may have 
been their impression, but I am 
sure I did not say that," he 
emphasized. 
Stohrer found it ironic that two weeks prior to their meeting with Benesh, the Dancin' Irish's revised constitution was submitted into Student Activities and accepted. She remembered that. "it had been accepted, and the section in it that wasn't revised was our purpose · which was to do dance at major athletic events. We had nothing in there," continued Stohrer, ·'restricting our activities to only basketball, just dancing at major athletic events. That was accept­able when we first got started and they accepted it now.'' 
Stefani and Stohrer next enlisted ·the services of John Ryan, Asst. to 
Student Body President, Dave 
Bender. The co-captains said Ryan 
went to see Benesh and found out 
he had sent a letter to Bro. Just, 
Dir. of Student Affairs, informing 
him of his decision to restrict the 
Dancin' Irish from performing on 
the football field. Ryan also tried to 
get the support of Dave Bender 
behind the Dancin' Irish. Accord­
ing to Stohrer, however, "Bender 
Was totally against it. He wouldn't· 
go for it so he said he couldn't help 
us." 
"Who else do we go to?" 
Stefani asked. She noted that , 
"Bro. Benesh said it stopped with 
him. We found out too late about 
Bro. Just. How much higher can 
we go-Fr. Hesburgh?" 
Stefani concluded that, "The 
whole point we're trying to get out 
of this is that we feel we're getting 
a run-around. They have been 
sending us around since the first 
week of school, I'm sure they knew 
from the beginning that we weren't 
going to get out,'' continued Stef­
ani, "but yet they had us run­
around from pillar to post to all 
these different places." 
"It wouldn't have been so bad if we 
could get some valid reason why, 
but we don't see the difference 
between whether or not the Dan 
cin' Irish perform or the cheerlead­
ers get up and dance there. How 
many people would notice the

Martin's contract runs through 1979 
NEW YORK [AP] -The New York Yankees gave Billy Martin a public pat on the back and a fat bonus Tuesday, temporarily removing the blade that had been 
hanging  over  the  head  of .the  
beleaguered manager.  
President  Gabe  Paul  hauled  

Martin into a hastily called press conference hours before the sixth World Series game against the Lost Angeles Dodgers to make the announcement.

"I was thinking about a home run the last time," Jackson said, "but really, I was more or less thinking about a hit. I had a good swing at it and-BINGO! I couldn't really believe it." 
The end of the Yankees' tumul­tuous and divisive but ultimately successful campaign also came as a relief to Martin, who cried tears of joy just one year after he wept in embarassment when the Yankees were swept in four games by the Cincinnati Reds. 
"I can't put it into words," said the fiery little manager as he sat 
Contributions up 'two-fold' 
[Continued from page 3) years rate ot contribution was up "at least two-fold" from last year. 
J.P. Russell, student campaign chairman, attributes the great stu­dent donation to "a concerted 
 effort to collect from individual students. This was different," continued Russell, "from last years fund source of student sponsored functions." This was an appropri­ate contribution given that students are on a marginal income,stated Russell. 
Hotline Program 

A total of 2SOO people throughout the St. Joseph County are active volunteers. Aside from getting pledges, some of these volunteers operate a Hotline system which consists of a 24 hour crisis interven­tion phone service. Volunteers staff the phones by working a minimum of four hours a week. 
On the average there are 600 calls coming into the office each month. These calls deal with all types of personal problems and .:rises. 
Volunteers are trained in com­munication skills, crisis interven­tion, sexuality and drug problems, child-abuse, rape and suicide and community recourses. 
The United Way Hotline system also provides services for agencies such as Sex Offense Staff (SOS), , Child Abuse and Neglect Co-ordi­nating (CANCO), Drug Abuse Rescue Team (DART) and Gam­blers Anonymous. 
Hotline will offer a marathon training session the weekend of Nov. 12. An initial meeting will be on Thursday, Nov. 10 with an optional session being offered on Tuesday. Nov. IS. All sessions will be held at St. Mary's campaign headquarters.

Martin, attired in jeans and leather jacket and looking sleepy­eyed, also took the rostrum to read a reply.

"It's something you wish for all your life and here it's happened," continued Martin, who played on four World Championship teams as a Yankee under Casey Stengel and finally became a championship pilot while managing his fourth major league team. 
"I bet he's happy," Martin said with a catch in his voice as he stared at a prominent picture of Stengel on his wall. , 
"I know he's happy. I have a lot to thank that man for, but I wish he'd taught me more about public relations.

Martin indicated he wanted, the 
assembled newsmen seemed at a 
loss to understand the significance 
ofthe impromptu press conference. 
"What are you trying to tell us 
-that Billy is not going to be fired?" 
someone asked. 
"Exactly," replied Paul. 

There have been recurring rumors that Martin was going to get the axe at the end of this season regardless ofthe Yankees' success, because of his obstinacy and fre­quent clashes not only with owner George Steinbrenner, but also with key players, particularly the $2.9 million superstar, Reggie Jackson, signed personally by Steinbrenner before the start of the season. 
The fiery manager, who previ­ously had lost jobs at Minnesota, Detroit and Texas, almost came to blows with Jackson after yanking the right fielder in a nationally televised game in mid-June and Steinbrenner reportedly flew to Detroit to fire him on June 19. 
Jackson joined catcher Thruman Munson, backup catcher Fran

"Reggie was super, just super. 
I'm real happy for him." 

Martin's discourse was interrup­ted by the entrance of George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' out­spoken and controversial owner. Acting calm, cool and collected and wearing a poker face, Steinbrenner extended his hand to Martin, muttered, "Nice going, see you later," and started to walk away. 
But only for a second. The owner and the manager fell into each others arms and Steinbrenner said, "The World Championship is back in New York where it belongs."

saved. 
The manager's post appeared further jeopardized last weekend when Martin and Jackson engaged in a sharp exchange after Jackson criticized the choice of stale Catfish Hunter for pitching duty in the second Wprld Series game. Tur­moil was intensified with the release of excerpts ·from a Time magazine article which quoted Jackson as saying he would not play in 1978 if Martin were still manager. 
Jackson emphatically denied the statement. A New York paper accused Steinbrenner of planting 
the  magazine  story  in  order  to  
grease  the  skids  for  Martins

Yankees on top once again! 
Jackson explodes for 3 HRs, Torrez pitches complete game 
NEW YORK [AP] -Reggie 
Jackson smashed three home runs 
tying a World Series record set by 
Babe Ruth 51 years ago, and 
powered the New York Yankees to 
baseball's World Championship 
last night with an 8-4 victory over 
the Los Angeles Dodgers. 

Jackson, who played a major role in the season-long soap opera of the Yankees, brought the story to a fairy tale conclusion with a two-run homer in the fourth, a two-run homer in the fifth and a solo shot into the center field bleachers in the eight. Each homer came on the first pitch. 
It was the first time in World 
Series history anyone had hit three 
consecutive home runs. 

Chris Chambliss also ripped a two-run homer and Mike Torrez rode the long-ball attack to an easy, nine-hit victory as the Yankees nailed down their 21st world title and their first in 15 years. 
lhe homers were the third, fourth and fifth of the World Series for Jackson -the Yankees' leading hitter with a .450 average -as the Yankees won. 
Jackson's five home runs were the most ever by one player in a World Series. 
The first homer erased a 3-2 Dodgers lead and the second put the Yanks on top 7-3. The first twor were virtually identical, low line 
drives into the lower right field 
stands, but the third was a tower­
ing drive that bounced into an 
unoccupied area of the bleachers 
and had the capacity crowd of 
56,407 roaring its approval. 

Jackson came out of the dugout 
and doffed his cap to set off yet 
another round of cheering by the 
nearly hysterical crowd. 

After the Dodgers had scored two unearned runs in the first inning, Jackson opened on the Yankees second by walking on four pitches. Chambliss followed with his home run into the right field bleachers, tying the score. 
But Reggie Smith restored the Los Angeles lead with a third inning homer. It was his third of the Series and the ninth for the Dodgers, tying the National League record set by the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1955 and tied by Milwaukee in 1957. 
That made it 3-2 Dodgers, but Jackson took over at that point, with an awesome power show that rewrote the World Series record books. 
His first homer followed a leadoff single by Munson in the fourth inning. The hit extended Mun­son's world Series hitting streak to ten straight games -all four last year against Cincinnati and six this October. 
In the fifth, Jackson connected

by Laurie Reising Women's Sports Editor 
The first Notre Dame-St. Mary's Irish Invitational tennis tournament is history now and co-organizers Sharon Petro of Notre Dame and Kathy Cordes of St. Mary's have dubbed it "A tremendous success.' Said Petro, "I had coaches during the play of the tourney ask me to be sure and include them again next year-that alone speaks for its success.'' 
The tournament had seven schools: Central Michigan, Eastern Michigan, Marquette, Louisville, Miami of Ohio, and the two host schools, battling it out Friday and Saturday for top honors in singles and doubles competition. Miami of Ohio collected 28 points for a first place finish while St. Mary's and Notre Dame placed fourth and sixth with 18 and nine points respec­tively 
Coach Cordes was pleased with her squad's position. "Con-she said, "Ofcourse I wish we had placed a bit higher, but this tournament brought in the best competition Notre Dame has ever seen." 
The competition was stiff in the first singles action and Cindy Schuster of St. Mary's found this out early. She was trounced by Sue Wartner of Miami of Ohio 6-0,6-0. Mary Shukis of Notre Dame started out on the right foot defeating her opponent from Louisville 6-1,7-5 but was stopped in the next round by theeventualwinner, Kelli Serges of Central Michigan 6-0,6-0. 
St. Mary's made a strong showing in third singles compeition thanks to sophomore Tammy Griffin who had to come back twice from losses in the first set. By defeating players from Marquette and 
Jackson captures MVP 
NEW YORK [AP] -Reggie Jackson, whose five home runs set a World Series record, was named Most Valuable Player of the Series for his accomplishment Tuesday night. 
Jackson, who will receive a car from a national magazine, became the first man in Series history to hit three consecutive home runs. The only other man to hit three in a single game was the legendary Babe Ruth, who did it for the Yankees in 1926 and 1928, both times against the Cardinals in St. Louis. 
Jackson's 25 total bases and JO runs scored also set Series records. 
The previous marks of 24 total bases for a seven game series was shared by Brooklyn's Duke Snider, who did it in 1952, and Lou Brock of St. Louis, who did it in 1958. 
The record for a six game series was set in 1953 by current Yankees Manager Billy Martin. 
Previous record for runs scored in a Series was nine, shared by Yankee immortals Ruth-who did it in 1928-and Lou Gehrig. who did it in 1932. 
In addition. Jackson's five home runs contributed to a two-team total of 17 homers -the most ever in a single World Series.

again, tagging the first pitch with two out after Mickey Rivers had opened with a single and was forced out on an attempted sacri­fice. 
Still, Jackson wasn't through. In the eight, leading off, he hit a towering blast well back into the center-field bleachers, far beyond the 417-foot sign, an area of the Stadium rarely reached. 
Stirred by Jackson's heroics, and by the Yankee victory, fans poured onto the field as Torrez got pinch hitter Lee Lacy on a pop to the mound for the final out. 
Jackson barreled through the crowd, knocking over several fans en route to the dugout. Fans gr<!bbed Willie Randloph;s hat and bumped other Yankees players as police moved in to try and keep order. 
Rut all they could do is watch as tl~ fans raced around the diamond 
when Barbfimm and Louise Purcell St. Mary's seniors, met freshman twins Laura and Sheila Cronin of Notre Dame. Youth fell to ex­perience 6-2,6-2. The St. Mary's duo proceeded to defeat Marquette 6-2,6-3 to advance to Saturday's finals action where they met East­ern Michigan. Despite a gusty wind and SO degree temperatures, Timm and Purcell breezed to a 6-3,6-2 victory and first place. Remarked Timm, "I can't believe it, after four years we finally made it!" 
The tournament closed out the fall season for the Notre Dame squad. Under their new coach, Petro, the Irish finished with a 5-5 record. "Considering how young this team was, I think the most valuable thing we gained was experience; something we'll have to build upon for next season," said Petro. 
For St. Mary's though, there's still more to come. The "Belles" finished their dual competition season with an impressive 9-1 record and a chance to participate in the upcoming Regionals compet­ition. By placing second among 16 schools vieing in the Indiana Small College tournament, the team qual­ified for a berth in the Regionals which will be held in Chicago next spring. 
Coach Cordes remarked that she is "thrilled and really looking forward to competing against some fine talent." "I think continued Cordes, "our record more than proves that we have the depth and ability to perform well in the Regionals.''

in joyous celebration. There were some scuffles, but there did not appear to be any major damage. 
Torrez carried the five-run lead into the ninth, and with the police ringing the stands down the right and left field lines to try to control the crowds, the sturdy right bander went to work. He struck out Bon Cey leading off. Then, after singles by Steve Garvey and Dusty Baker, Rick Monday flied deep to Jackson at the right field wall. 
That brought up pinch hitter Vic Davalillo, who bunted for a run to make it 8-4. Martin visited Torrez at the mound but stayed with his pitcher to face Lacy. 
When it ·was over, the fans daimed the fieid with a sea of bodies sweeping over the Stadium that was modernized at a cost of $100 million just two years ago. 
It was the first World Champion­ship in the new stadium and Jackson's power display made it one of the most memorable in the storied history of the Yankees.

Clt~bhouse is joyous, satisfied 
NEW YORK [AP] -"Nothing can top this!" 
Reggie Jackson, somewhat subdued for a man who had just hammered three screaming home runs in the final game of the World Series Tuesday night, stood in the champagne-drenched clubhouse of the New York Yankees -the center of attention, just as he always said he would be. 
''This showed what kind of men we have, what kind of human beings we are," said Jackson between gulps of champagne from a bottle clutched in his hand. 
"I really don't want to talk about everything that's happened this 
year," he went on. "It's dead. 
The Bible says that the weak man is 
he who can not stand adversity. 
"There's a God out there some­place. I had tremendous odds against me and He helped me. This shows that everybody can get up no matter how far down you are." 
Paraphrasing the words of Los Angeles Manager Tom Lasorda, someone asked Jackson if there was a great Yankee in the sky? The slugging right fielder frowned. 
"No. Don't make fun. I try to be a good Christian but I'm not perfect. I sin all the time." 
Jackson, along with many other 
I

Yankees, seemed more relieved that the season had come to an end than overjoyed by the Yankees' first World Championship in 15 I years. 
But every so often; his elation ~ showed through. 
"Nothing can top this," he j repeated. "Who's gonna hit three home runs in the deciding game of <he Vv'ord Series?" 
Here, he permitted himself a slight smile. "I'm not." 
It was an incredibly powerful end to a season which began in contro­versy, which ebbed and flowed all summer -right up to the afternoon of the final game, when the Yankees finally gave Manager Billy Martin a vote of confidence and said he would fill the remaining two years of his contract. 
"I hit the ball good in batting practice. Real good," Jackson said. "I knew they'd pitch me inside and I was just trying to keep the ball in the playing field. The first two home runs were on balls inside. They were trying to pitch me in all Series." 
Jackson hit a two-run shot off Burt Hooton in the fourth inning, another two-run smash off Elias

St. Mary's basketball ticket allocation is reduced 
by KeUy Conlin 

Basketball tickets allotted to Saint Mary's College have been greatly reduced this year according to Mary Laverty, Director of Stu­dent Activities. In recent years the college had been allocated 350 bleacher seat tickets, but this year the total has been drastically reduced to 150. Mike Busick, Notre Dame Ticket Manager claims that the main reason for the severe reduction is that the demand from the Notre Dame students and faculty has been much greater this year. To make up for this deficit he reduced Saint Mary's ticket sales by 200 and declared a moratorium on all general admission tickets. 
To compensate for the reduction the ACC, for the first time, is allowing the Saint Mary's students to share tickets with one or more other students. The senior class will be allocated 75 tickets, while the other classes will be allotted 25 each. Laverty stated that "the only fair way to distribute the tickets is through a lottery." Starting Octo­ber 17 through November 1 stu­dents will be able to fill out applications at either the Student Activities Office in LeMans Hall or at any of the resident hall desks. This entitles the student to have their name put into the school lottery, which is to be held Novem­ber 2. 
Lists of the lottery winners will be posted in all resident hall lobbies and in the dining hall. Lottery winners are to make checks payable to Notre Dame Athletic Department, and turn them in to the Saint Mary's Student Activities Officse no later than Friday, November 4. 
In previous years~ all ticket sales were taken care of in the spring, but because the basketball sche­dule was not set at that time, the ticket office has delayed distribu­tion until the fall. 
Laverty commented that she felt, "The Saint Mary's students will be very disappointed" at the cutdown on ticket sales. According to Busick, ticket sales "might change again next year and probably won't go down any more."
