Meningitis strikes student 
A case of dangerous spinal meningitis was discovered on campus this weekend, ac­cording to Richard Conklin, director of public information. 
Sophomore Michael Kearse, a Morrissey resident and Student Union member, collapsed Friday night in the hall and was taken to Memorial Hospital in South Bend. Yesterday morning doctors diagnosed the symptoms as those of 'spinal meningitis, a highly contagious inflammation of the membrane which encloses the spinal chord and brain. 
Dr. Francis Sellers, University physician, immediately notified county health officers and Notre Dame officials. Friends of Kearse are being alerted and urged to seek preventive treatment immediately. Over 100 students have already been to the in­firmary for sulfa drugs which are almost 100 per cent effective in countering the progression of the disease. 
Demand for the drugs soon exhausted available infirmary supplies, and also those in South Bend. However, it will be replenished be tomorrow afternoon. 
Kearse is an employee of the South Dining hall; this fact has prompted much concern 

Memingitis i_s an infectious disease of the brain linings and of the central nervous system. The relatively rare disease is caused by the bacterial nisseria meningiditus. 
The symptoms, among others, are a high fever, a stiff neck, and a rash. It is con­sidered contagious within "family contact," meaning that it can be spread among members of a section, classroom, or a social group. It is a respiratory or "droplet" in­fection, spread in a way similar to the cold. 
Meningitis is prevented by administering sulfa drugs, and, once it begins, is treated by penicillin. It is not known how and from where the disease originates. There have been no recently reported cases in St. Joseph County. The last reported case on the Notre Dame campus was in 1955. 
about the number of students exposed to the disease. However, Conklin assured the Observer last night that there was "no fear of an epidemic," but that necessary precautions were a must. 
Dr. Howard R. Engel, internal medical specialist and Kearse's attendant physician, said that he was "very encouraged" as to the student's prospects for complete recovery. But he added a note of warning , saying that anyone with a persistent fever and sore throat should seek treatment immediately, as these are possible symp­toms of meningitis. 
A spokesman at Memorial Hospital last night listed Kearse in "poor" condition. 
Kearse is an employee of the South Dining 
hall; this fact has prompted much concern 
about the number of students exposed to the 
disease. The infirmary last night indicated 
that there was no cause for alarm among 
students who regularly eat there. 
"If you think you've been in contact with 
him, then the drug should be taken," a nurse 
advised.

Large refrigerutors to be banned 
by Bob Cosentino 
If the Notre Dame ad­ministration gets its way --and it usually does --all refrigerators over 4.6 cubic feet will be banned from the dorms next year. That means that hundreds of old salvation army ice boxes currently used by students in the dorms will be obsolete. 
Obviously, many owners of the old 'fridges who have become attached to their machines are quite disturbed about having to throw their boxes out. What will happen to these old refrigerators is still unsolved. Suggestions by indignant students range from burial in St. Mary's Lake to depositing them on Father
 Chambers' doorstep. ft'ather Thomas Chambers, director of student residence, has indicated that all large refrigerators will be banned next year because of the fire hazard they produce within the dorms. Also. the university's insurance company reportedly insists that all old refrigerators be removed from the rooms. 
"We have no choice in the matter,·' remarked Brother Kieran Hyan, vice-president of 
(continued from pg. 1) 
From a helicopter yesterday, Anloc and the small rubber plantation towns to the east, west and north. had seemed to have suffered devastation from North Vietnamese artillery attacks and American bombing. Broad swathes cut through the tightly packed green rubber trees showed where B-52's had dropped their long rows of bombs only a mile from Anloc. The northern half of the circle-shaped town appeared to have been completely flattened by the continual bombardment. 
Helicopter pilots described the 
antiaircraft fire from the areas 
around the town as the most in­
tense they had ever seen so close to 
Saigon. It has taken its toll of 
American and South Vietnamese 
planes, which swarmed over Anloc 
yesterday. Army helicopter 
gunships, Air Force C-130 tran­
sports dropping supplies by 
parachute, Air Force and Navy 
Phantom jets and propeller driven 
South Vietnamese Air Force 
skyraiders participated. Without 
the massive air support, American 
officers in the field say, Anloc 
would have fallen days ago. 
'I nus. at the moment, there is 
cause for both optimistic and 
pessimistic judgments of the 
course of the offensive. The South 
Vietnamese have stOPJ:e~eir business affairs. "The old klunkers are a serious problem and they have to go." 
Nevertheless, many students still like the idea of throwing out their old refrigerators. John Gezich, a junior in the Zephyrs section of Keenan Hall, retorts, "A lot of students have invested much money into their old ice boxes Besides the initial 40 dollar cost of the refrigerator, it also costs 30 dollars a year in fines just to keep it." 
Gezich's roommate sophomore Charles Grimm purchased his box at the salvation army last Sep­tember. "Charlie expected the refrigerator to last him his remaining three years at Notre Dame. That's why he bought it in the first place. Now the ~.chool says he has to throw it away after only one year of use. Who could he possibly sell it to?" 
Other students have questioned Father Chambers' and Brother Hyan's reasons for banning the old refrigerators. The adminstration claims the 'fridges are a fire hazard as well as a health hazard. "Often the wiring and insulation in the really old ones are faulty,"'' said Brother Ryan. '"Sometimes the food in them is not proplerly refrigerated. They also bring cockroaches into the rooms." 
Brother Hyan did mention, however, that there has been no fires reported in the past caused by faulty refrigerators. And out of the eight owners of old refrigerators on second floor Keenan, no one has reported any operational problems with the machines. Les Rud­nyanszky, the R.A. of that floor, bought his big ice box 2 and 1" years ago from another student. He says it works as good as new. 
"I don't really think the ad­ministration is justified in banning old refrigerators," ,"commented Runyanszky. "The refrigerators can't take up much more power than color TV's. And we have about four color TV's on the floor." 
He also noted that cockroaches will be attracted to the rooms as long as students keep food in their rooms, whether it be in a small, new refrigerator or a large, old one. 
Hudnyanszky also pointed out that the new 4.6 cubic feet limit on refrigerators happens to be the size of the boxes sold by various organizations around campus, including the bookstore.

refrigerators keep them, but just not let any more students buy mem, "suggested sophomore Dave Grimmer, who bought a used box this year. "The ad­ministration seems to be forcing students to buy small ones. And 
· since there aren't too many used small ones around, they'll have to buy a new refrigerator costing over 100 dollars." 
The administration has made no final decision on bans or fines, although an announcement is expected soon. Some hall presidents are discussmg vanous possibilities to be presented to Father Chambers, who will make the final decision. 

Brother Ryan previously in­dicated that the fines for next year will probably be the same as this year. However, Carmen Maciariello, president of Fisher Hall, said there may be a minimum increase of fines for next year to help pay for the extensive rewiring of the halls.

Ginsberg protests the war 

by Carol Weiss The Sophomore Literary I<'estival closed out its 1972 season I<'riday with poet Allen Ginsberg at Washington Hall at 8:30. Ginsberg read and chanted before a capacity audience for three hours ac­companied by peace protesters, audience, guitar, flute, and banjo. The poet framed his appearance

last summer showed him the "unwillingness and inability of high public officials to recognize their responsibliity and complicity in the crimes of the Government." 
This "singular event" had such a great influence on him, said Martin, that he considers Tarr's testimony to be essential. 
Martin added that Tarr, instead of a local employee of Selective Service, was needed because Tarr "cannot pass on responsibility for his office to someone else." 
Luce was asked as an "eye witness to war crimes" and able to testify to the "criminality" of army intelligence ,activities in Vietnam. 
Luce is qualified, said the defense, to give the history of the war from a Vietnamese viewpoint. He lived in Vietnam from 1954 to 1967.

as a personal peace protest beside an 8-foot wooden cross marked 'Roman Catholic Church.' Gin­sberg dedicated his mantras (chants) to working out the "demonic energies" and "hLtngry ghosts" at Notre Dame espedally at this time of crisis. He made note of the "little concerted action here on the campus at this time of suffering," pointing to the special challenge of Notre Dame as a Catholic center.· 
Pumping a harmonium, the poet began a mantra series on 3 variations with the words projected on the backdrop above him. Ginsberg termed the first, from the Buddhist Book of Death, a "suitable proclamation of flower power." The Indian words flowed through OM <bodyl-AH (speechl­GURU <leader-hope) as Ginsberg instructed the audience to straighten their spine, relax their belly, and breath a sighful OHM, comparable "to the great familiar

Recognizable language was offered to the audience for the first time with Blake's western gnostic mantra on "Spring." "Merrily, merrily we welcome in the year" was the phrase dedicated to the peace action group who brought the confrontation with suffering and the crucifixion back to cam­pus. It was a heralding of "the springtime of their suffering." Ginsberg improvised new words to the contagious melody and the audience joined in to clap, laugh, sway, and chant "go and end the war-caste out the devil from the door." 
In another Hindu mantra Gin­sberg bowed before "the name of Shiva. the cross of change." He then took up the rhythm for some of his own poetry and proposed through the mantra medium "ascetism in our life or con­spicuous consumption." His economic mantra echoed "Don't smoke, don't smoke, don't smoke ...
