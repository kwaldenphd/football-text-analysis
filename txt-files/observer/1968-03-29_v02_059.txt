Rossie And Murphy Finalize Plans Process Clash With Administration 
Senate Censures Administration 
By CHRIS WOLFE 
The student Senate Wed. night passed by consensus strong censures proposed by SBP-elect Richard Rossie against Univer­sity action Tues. in the suspension of four Notre Dame students for parietal hour rules violations. It also laid down articles to be presented to the University President and Board of Trustees as a basis for future University action in admini­stering justice. 

The main objections of the Senate were the injustice of both the procedure involved in the case, and the severity of the penalty. 
Among the procedural actions specifi­cally objected to were the lack of a trial

Breakdown 
With Hesburgh 
By P.J. SCHROEDER 
Chris Murphy and Rich Rossie, in a surprise move last night called a meeting in Nieuwland Science Hall of more than 150 Hall Presidents, Section Leaders, and Senators. 
The purpose of the meeting, said Murphy, was to inform the student body, by way of its section leaders, of the specific issue which has arisen from the suspension of four students by the Dean of Students, Rev. James Riehle, last Tuesday afternoon. 

"The issue which confronts us", said Murphy, "is not one concerning Parietal Hours, but, more importantly, it is a question of Due Process." 
Rich Rossie, Student BodyPresident­Elect, read aloud the text of a letter lie and Murphy had written yesterday after­noon which was addressed and delivered to the whole student body. Throughout the meeting Rossie and Murphy emph­asized the "arbitrary and summary" pro­ceedure which they believed was used by Father Riehle in suspending the four students. 
One of the suspended students from Zahm Hall came before the assembly and gave his version of how the Dean of stu­dents and his Advisory Board had conduc­ted their interview. He said that he and his companions had decided to "tell Father Riehle the whole story because we believed that by cooperating with them in every way we would save them the trouble of having to hunt up witnesses." 

In the discussion which followed, rep­resentatives from Zahm and Alumni halls each said that they were "extremely disappointed" that their rectors had not submitted the cases to the Hall Judicial Boards. A spokesman from Zahm Hall said that the rector, Father Blantz, de­clined to place the case before the Zahm Board because there were three students involved. The spokesman said Blantz had decided that if the case were put before the Hall Board it would become too "bogged down" in the process of trying three different cases, each of which had the right to appeal the decision three times. 
Another student asked Rossie and Murphy what action had been taken to lift the suspensions and to bring the __.,­students involved before the Campus Judical Board. Murphy replied that he and Rossie had met for two and one half hours yesterday afternoon with Father Hesburgh, Father McCarragher, Vice-Pres­ident of Student Affairs, and Father Edmund Joyce, Executive Vice-President of the University. Murphy said he had

Fare May Be Charged For Shuffle Ride Next Year 
The Student Union Transportation Commission has submitted a proposal to purchase a new shuttle bus for the next school year, which would probably entail a fare for riding the bus. SUTC also announced two Easter bus trips to O'Hare International Air­port on April I 0 and 11. 
According to the Transportation Commission report the bad condition of the present shuttle bus, the rise in repair bills and the need for a new bus prompted the proposal. 
Due to the cornering problems on campus the commission suggested the purchase of a thirty-one passenger 
:·:·:·~ ;~~;c~~·o~~::h:~~~~~~ ~o~:~~talm~~­
than $4,000. The prices of the busses under consideration range from $1250 to $3500 with an additional $250 or $300 for tires. 
The commission considered the pre­sent way of payment for the operation of the bus as unfair to the students who did not use the bus. The student currently pays for his share of the bus 
through his student government activi­
ty fee. The Student Government pays
for one-third of the $6,500 per year

The report suggests that the students 
have the opportunity to purchase com­
mutation tickets for $1.50 per semes­
ter. These tickets would give the hold­
er seating priority over the other 
passengers who would pay 10 cents 
per ride. According to the proposal, 
"Thus, anyone using the vehicle more 
than IS times per semester, will re­
ceive an attractive deal by buying 
a commutation ticket." 
The report also made several schedul­
ing suggestions, such as a library shuffle 
bus after 6 pm Sun. through Thurs. 
Due to the traffic caused by the 
construction workers "all trips leaving

store." It also proposed a stop at the 
Halfway House. 
Rick Rembusch, newly appointed 
Student Union President, said nothing 
would be known on the impiementa­
tion of the proposal until the Senate 
approves the budget. 
The O'Hare busses will be run 
only if there is enough interest. The trip will cost $4.00 with one bus 
leaving St. Mary's on April I0 and the other leaving from Notre Dame the

In a three hour session Tues. 

evening, the Notre Dame Faculty 
Senate passed resolutions on 
class attendance procedures and 
an Open Student Speakers Poli­
cy, while initiating debate on a 
campus Publications Policy. 
Following various committee reports, a resolution was advanc­ed on class absences. The essence 
of the statement was two-fold: 
a) it would give the individual instructor as much lee-way as possible; b) grades would be based on performance, not atten­dance. 
The instructor of each class, at ihe beginning of a term, would be required to openly de­fine his attendance regulations. Theoretically, he could demand no-cuts (as might be necessary for certain lab courses) or allow unlimited cuts. Faith was placed in "the reasonableness of the teaching staff'.

The issue of making up work 
was clarified by an amendment 
introduced by Assistant-Profes­
sor Rev. Ernest Bartell, C.S.C., 
of the Econ. Dept. This amend­
ment requires that students miss­
ing class, but excused for uni­
versity business or for personal 
reasons could not be penalized 
for their absence. In other cases, 
however, procedure would be 
left to the discretion of the in­
structor. The amendment and 
resolution both passed. 
The Open Speakers Policy, 
taken from a larger AAUP docu­
ment, drew lines of fire. Father 
Burrell, C.S.C. supported such a . 
policy stressing the value of 
speakers "outside broad and . .Catholic opinion". 
Prof. Bernard Norling, Act­
ing Chairman of the Hist. Dept., 
led the opposition, and declared 
that, "the University has the 
right to defend its traditions". He then mentioned the Father Kavanaugh incident, the appear­ance of Ron Karanga, and recent speaking engagements of other controversial figures on campus. He subsequently moved to tack an amendment to the resolution which would allow final adminis­trative approval of campus speak­ers. 
Debate on the issue continued 
nearly an hour. From the dis­
cussion a tangent emerged on the 
exact nature of Faculty Senate body is primarily limited in fi­nancing speakers of their own choosing. Further, the Adminis­tration, through scheduling of facilities on campus, is left a loophole. But the central point is one of Student rights. "Cen­sorship in advance," according to Prof. Manier, is "completely inadvisable". Student responsi­bility demands that they be al­
lowed  to  invite  whom  they  
please.  
Prof.  Norling's  amendment  

was decisively beaten and the main motion passed easily. The final resolution was a statement of Publications Policy, in part reading, "Whenever pos­sible the student newspaper should be an independent cor­poration financially and legally separate from the university." 



Spanish Students Protest Exams 
Dismayed first year Spanish students (Spanish 11 & 12) are protesting what they feel are unfair procedures within that department. A petition, stem­ming from results of the last departmental exam on which over 50% received D's or F's, began circulating among the stu­dents involved Wed. The student's statement makes two major com­plaints: the teaching is poor and the test are unfair. 
The author of the petition said "we'd like those in the Spanish department, especially Senor Francisco Moreno, to con­centrate more on teaching the

language and less on making the course appear 'tough' by flunking as many as possible." Reluctant at the prospect of publication, student petitioners wished to emphasize that they did not want to jeopardize the position of any professors or instructors, but merely obtain fair treatment for themselves. 
They also said that the problem 
was not with the upper divisions avy ee of the department but with those. G A 

An old fashion navy helm 
wheel, which has been on dis­
play in the Navy ROTC building 
since 1964, was stolen late Sat. 
night. The wheel had just been 
recovered that afternoon after 
having been missing since early 
in January. 
Early in January the wheel 
was "removed" from the ROTC 
building. The only clue which 
was left was a 3 x 5 index card 
which bore the inscription: "Ros­
es are Red, Violets are Blue, This 
wheel was stolen by C.I.U." 
(C.I.U. stands for the Counter Insurgency Unit of Army ROTC) Last Fri. night the wheel was 
located by a midshipman. Sat. 
morning a group of midshipmen 
recovered it and replaced it in 
the fourier of the building. 
Sat. night the wheel was miss­
ing again. This time the thieves 
left no clues. 
Because the wheel is United 
States Navy property, the F.B.I. 
and the Office of Naval Intelli­
gence had to be notified. Foot­
prints off the floor and finger 
prints off the window that the 
criminals entered were taken. 
A high ranking Navy officer told the Observer, "if we get the thing back or get some lead on where it is, we will not pursue the thing any further." He said though that if the person had to be located through the use of the finger prints it could necessitate disciplinary action. 
"It will turn up some day. somewhere," he said. "We're not too worried about it. Maybe who­ever took it can put it to better use than we did."

An Open Letter To Rev. Theodore Hesburgh 
March 26, 1968 
Rev. Theodore Martin Hesburgh, CSC President in Absentia University of Notre Dame 
Notre Dame, Indiana 
Dear Father Hesburgh: 

I received your photo-offset letter in my mailbox on March 25. Apparently, it was not addressed to me at all but to Christopher J. Murphy, the present Student Body President. I find this a rather unusual procedure, espe­cially if it is supposed to get primary atten­tion from him. Are we supposed to tell him what you said if we see him? Wouldn't it have been easier just to write to him alone and spa­red the University (currently predicting a $500,000 deficit this year) the $600 to $800 printing bill? 
You state in your letter that you "believe" about one-sixth of the student body attended the General Assembly. Aren't you sure? Won't Father McCarragher let you read the Observer so you can find out what the students are doing? Or perhaps you feel that the one thou­sand students who sacrificed their time in an l attempt to formulate some constructive pro­I posals on University life are not worthy of the 
l 
I attention of such a nationally prominent per­sonage as Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, CSC. 
·­
It amazes me to note that the clever pro­pagandist who wrote your letter for you at­tempts to turn the planning that went into 'the General Assembly against the planners. If in­deed the doc'-lments presented to you have undergone "some months of study and plan­ning," then certainly those who have formu­lated the measures should be prepared to ex­plain and defend them. And since it is only these bills that are to be discussed, there is no reason to suppose that, if they had any solid conception of what they wished the Universi­ty to be, the President and Vice Presidents would not be able to react to these concrete proposals without extended deliberation. 
Incidentally, I was somewhat embarrassed to note that the paragraph chiding Mr. Mur­phy for the spelling errors in his document contained an obvious grammatical mistake. A dash is expressed on a typewriter by two con­secutive hyphens, not one. I am surprised Mr. Shuster didn't catch that one. 
Also, someone should inform Father McCar­ragher that there is no Local Council because, from his conversations with students, he ap­
pears to think he is on a council so entitled. It would indeed be tragic if a Vice President of the University should continue to attend meetings of a nonexistent group. Now that it has served its particular political purpose, the question of whether it is the Local Council (as Father McCarragher calls it) or the Council 
of Vice Presidents might well be clarified. 
I am happy to see that if the Board of Trus­tees feels itself threatened, it will pack its bags and go home. This shows a truly mature and responsible approach to student unrest. I am happy to note that all the encomiums that you and other Universityc officials have deliv­ered on Chris Murphy at SUMMA meetings have not deterred you from publishing a profes­sional character assassination to the entire 
student body at your earliest political con­venience. I think continued vacuous pieces like your la~est letter which go all out to pro­vide winning rhetoric would go far to cover your underlying belief that this University's students are to be treated as children. 
Though there have been no times when I have been tempted to think otherwise, as I have said so many times, I would trade the President of the University and a high draft choice for Kingman Brewster. I am sure that from there we could move forward and, in doing so, create a better Notre Dame. I am sharing this letter with anyone who is willing to believe that a university president could lend his name to such a piece of polyethylene 
viciousness as your letter represents. With all best wishes and prayers, I am 
Devotedly yours in Notre Dame,

Dark Elephant 
The symbol of the Republican Party is an elephant. This is totally unfair to elephants. An elephant never forgets. The Republican Party always forgets. Every four years, it nominates the most tremendous loser available. Every four years it loses. To truly represent the Republican Party in all its philosophical and political manifestations, the elephant, ifit must be an elephant, should be white. 
Since 1932, the Repub­lican Party has succeeded in electing only one man, a kindly old general who ~~f/1~1'\f appealed to the longing of the Fifties for security. But even he wasn't really a Republican. In fact, the Democrats would probably have nominated old Ike in 1948 if they hadn't been afraid that Harry Truman would react with some rather strong language. 
Unfortunately, you can't come up with a fatherly old general every year. Ike was such a nice man that people who criti­cized him for his unintelligible speeches merely looked vicious. He was also a winner (WW II, as we've been told). There aren't many winning generals ar­ound any more. Moshe Dayan is not available and a lot of Republicans aren't crazy about Jews anyway. 
So the Republicans are faced with the necessity of coming up with the biggest loser they can find. After all, it would be pretty embarrassing to have all those filthy factory workers, Negroes and other undesireables voting for your candidate. Think of how the D.A.R. would feel. No, it is absolutely certain that the Republican Party, in order to live up to its Divinely inspired principles, must nominate a man who will be absolutely repulsive to the plebeian masses of the American people. 
Nelson Rockefeller almost fouled up the whole system. After getting smeared in the California primary in 1964, he began to look like a loser too. But then he campaigned hard and was re-elected governor of New York, the Kennedy 
machine notwithstanding. Word got ar­
ound that he was not a true Republican. But now he's decided his feelings have been hurt and he's not going to play ball until the guys show him they really like him and want him to play. They don't and won't, and so Nelson joins a 

· long line of good Republicans who would rather punt than be President. 
Of course, the quintessential Repub­lican is Harold Stassen. In 1948, Stassen was almost nominated, but the party pros pulled it out at the last minute by nominating a wax replica of Thomas 
E. Dewey. Ever since, Harold has been trying to make up lost ground. He been running so long that he looks like he's standing still. His speed now equals that of the revolution of the earth and since he runs against it (since all Republicans are against revolutions), he always remains in the same spot, shrouded by perpetual twilight. 
It comt:s down finally to Richard M. Nixon, the only politician in America today who is uglier than Lyndon Baines Johnson. Johnson's current popularity rating is minus fifteen percent (actually, five percent are for him but twenty percent of the populace has devoted itself to actively despising him). So the price of failure will come high. It's not going to be easy to lie more than LBJ, or wave the flag more, or make more inane speeches. But the Republican Party has faith in Nixon's ability to turn gold into tinkling brass, to snatch disaster from the jaws of victory. Nominated for a seventh crisis-Richard Milhous Nixon.

Lies 
If over the last three years parents of the Class of 1969 have noticed some odd change in your son's regard for the law. If you have been startled occa­sionally when your son blurts out a re­mark "well I can get away with it." And if you wor.der how he began think­ing this way. 
Like all Universities Notre Dame has some rulesr and regulations which are de­signed to guide the community. They have one which forbids drinking in the rooms, one which forbids women in the rooms and another which forbids the use pf a hallucenogenic drug. 
Like all Universities, Notre Dame has a Dean of Students who is there to act as a friend to the stu­dent. We have Fr. James Riehle. But he is no friend. Even those closest to him will admit privately that they have lost respect for this man with each disci­plinary case he has handled. 

Last September Fr. Riehle returned to campus and was informed that a stu­dent (a senior art major) had been arrested for selling marijuana. He met with and dismissed the student in an hour. The suspension of the student would not have seemed so strange unless you consider the following points: 
l. That people in America are deemed innocent until proven guilty. 
2. 
That the student had committed the crime during August and since he was not in summer school, he was not under the jurisdiction of the University regula­tion on hallucenogenic drugs effective Sept. 15, 1967. 

3. 
That the student was merely charged with the sale of pot, not convicted. And that in fact evidence later uncovered proved that he will probably not be con­victed of the offense. (the case is still pending). 


Then there is the drinking rule which says that the University forbids drinking in the rooms of students. And the case 
of a senior who was caught carrying beer 


Tom s··fs'ln 
 j f1

RFK Center 
across campus, fined and told by Fr. Riehle that "next time carry it on in a suitcase, that's the way they did it when I went to school here." 
This would not have been so bad, ex­cept for the fact that the Administration has completely ignored the drinking regu­lation within the halls. But every now and then it picks up an example and crucifies him. 
Witness the case of parietal hours last week where four students were suspended for violations of the rule forbidding
,1
girls in students rooms. Father Hesburgh said that he would stand on that ruling if he had to "throw out 1 ,000 students and 14 rectors." Last week he threw out four students, which may be a fair punish­
ment.  But the fact is  no  one  will ever  
know.  
Three  of the  students  were  charged  

last week with violations which took place six weeks ago. All four of the stu­dents were both interrogated and judged by the same man, Fr. Riehle. 
The University normally has been giv­ing these offenses to hall jud1cial boards which fines students $10-15 per offense. 
Then there was the case of Fr. Riehle's sommons of policemen to the dining hall after a food poisoning, which partly pre­cipitated a food riot .... and the case of the "Black Hand" where full-fledged ho­
odlums pillaged the campus, beat stu­dents. Followed by Fr. Riehle's com­plaint that he couldn't understand why no one told him about it. 
That's what you learn at Notre Dame. You learn there are rules on the books. But that the University ignores them­sometimes. Just don't get caught because if they want they have the power to inter­rogate, to rule and to judge. And they do it simultaneously and before you know it you're out of school and your friend who committed the same offense gets off with a $5 fme. 
So if the parents of the juniors are wondering why some of us are so bitter about this disciplinary travesty now you know. It is simply because they lie. 

On a cold day last fall, Chuck Nau, Rich Rossie and myself were advised of the Minnesota Senator's impending chal­lenge to the President, and thus formed the first Students for McCarthy organiza­tion in the country. It was obvious that despair over Vietnam, the approaching elections, and relevance of the whole poli­tical system was spreading like a gloomy cancer among all age groups. Eugene McCarthy is to be commended for stand­ing forth at that hour. He gave us the means to focus our dissent for the past four months. But even the Senator knew that he had no chance of 
winning the nomination, and no amount of primary victories -which will pro­bably end for him in Wis­consin -can alter that sin­gle political fact. 
All we ever prayed and sweated and worked for was that our efforts might 


aid in creating a situation where Robert Kennedy would have a viable chance at the Presidency. Regard­
iess of the momentary glory he would have received by announcing earlier, he agonizingly awaited his hour amidst con­flicting charges of cowardice, ruthlessness, and now, opportunism. He waited until it 
was proven that it was not he, but Lyn­don Johnson and Vietnam that had split the Democratic Party. This action did not endear him to youthful idealists, but it was the only way, unfortunately, that the party hacks that can unseat Lyndon John­son could be opened to the fact that the issue at stake is more than switching per­sonalities. 
But we shifted our allegiance to Robert Kennedy for more reason than the increas­ingly obvious fact that he is the only man who has a realistic chance of preventing Johnson or Nixon from darkening the White House and this country for another four years. For Robert Kennedy gave our generation the hope and vision of a new America, and a new brand of politics, long before last November. It has been Robert Kennedy who has provided the focus to our ideas and dissent from a November four years previous. Can this man who saw his brother shot in the Dallas streets, then only to see their com­mon dreams for America slowly melt away be now termed an opportunist such as Lyndon Johnson? 
We saw the courage and vision of Rob­ert Kennedy five years ago in the counties of Mississippi and Alabama. And we ex­perienced a hope in our nation and its leaders that dissipated to near despair un­til his hour once arrived last week. We will not betray him and the legacy that 
he represents, for it once made us proud to be Americans. We respect and admire Eugene McCarthy, but we remember in whose hands we first placed our stars. 
Chris Jarabe" 
They Were There 
Random conversations this weekend 
with some servicemen brought home the 
credibility gap of the Vietnam war with 
unusual force. 
Grounded by bad weather at Pittsburgh after my plane had overflown Cleveland, I found myself batting around the Greater Pittsburgh airport while United was try­ing to provide alternate transportation. 
A certain sense of cam­
araderie develops among people waiting around in a lobby for six hours. My initial contact was with Tom, a 20 year-old private· based at Fort Sill, Okla­homa, who would soon be going to Vietnam. A young Negro private was standing near us, and Tom struck up 
a conversation. 

"Where are you stationed? Guess I'll be 
in Vietnam soon. I suspect I'll be sent to 
Saigon." 
"Oh no, baby, it won't be Saigon. 
There's nothing left there. I know. I'm 
just back from 'nam. We've pulling out of 
Saigon as fast as we can go. The Tet 
offensive did it. There's nothing left for 
us there. We're pullin' out to a place 
about 30 miles north." 
"But that can't be. I know I'll be 
sent to Saigon ."· 
"Look baby, take my word for it. You won't be. That's a military· secret right now, but what the hell. You just won't be there," and the young private sauntered off. 
I'm confused and I really don't know what to think. I guess you can believe about half of what guys coming back tell you, and even then you have to sort it all out. I mean, people brag. But right now, because I don't know what to think, I don't want to talk about it," was Tom's initial reaction. But I noticed that he was interested in gleaning every bit of infor-' _mation possible from fellow GI's. Tom didn't really want to think about the war, but his direct relationship to it compelled continuing inquiry. 
Apparently there is some sort of in­signia instantly recognizeable to any other serviceman that the army provides for its Vietnam veterans, because Tom charged up to another GI with "When did you get back? What's it like?" 
The corporal took his measure and began slowly, "Well, don't believe every­thing you read about the war. Maybe one quarter to one half of it is true. Like I mean, Saigon is destroyed as far as we're concerned and we're withdrawing to an­other stronghold." 
"You mean the en tire city is destroyed and we don't know it?" 
"No, I mean, the city is destroyed as far as our forces are concerned. Some of the civilian areas are fine, but our headquarters were demolished. They aren't reporting it but it's true. And besides, the South Vietnanese don't want us in Saigon anyway, because we're wreck­ing the city's economy with American 
dollars. It's too inflationary. So we have 
pressure there not to rebuild." 
"What about Khe Sanh?" 
"Well, like I told you, you can't believe 
what you read. We flew 400 guys in last 
week and 13 of them came beck. I was 
with a helicopter crew and I know. 
But you won't read that. The reports will 
be spread out over a week." 
"Thirteen? Surely not all of them died. You just mean casualties, don't you -I mean wounded?" 
"No, as far as we know they all died." 
Are they right? Who knows? Since the Tet offensive, the administration has an­nounced greater censorship of newsmen's files. But these two young men said they were there.

Nostalgia 
When a man realizes he is doing something for the last time, he is faced with two conflicting emotions -nostalgia· or outrage. He is either overcome with a foggy recollection of "good times" or he is going to unleash one final fiery indictment of the "estab­
-lishemnt." 
It would be easy to fill this concludine column with beautiful 
reminiscenses of four rewarding college years. Men like Figel 
Browning and Higgins are extraordinaire. They and many other 
people, places and events have made Notre Dame liveable. But 
there is trouble in paradise -the paradise ot Notre Dame, 
the paradise of America. 
The society in which we live is being governed by insanity. We are reeling in a chaotic universe too confused even to attempt an orientation. The conflict in Vietnam is growing daily, more bodies and munitions are being wasted in a hopeless war. The problem of the cities is being ignored. It is too costly to correct the inhuman condidtions of the ghetto while we dump billions of dollars into an endless war. 
. Risht now we are sec~m. Vi~tnam is half a. world away and City nots are two months In the future. But the Insanity has crept into the Notre Dame community. Our university president has arbitrarily dismissed four students for a violation of the regulation on parietal hours -a regulation that has been broken in the majority of residence halls every week-end of the year. This same man has stated that he would dismiss one thousand students and fourteen rectors rather than reassess his stand on admitting women into the "men's clubs." He now has nine hundred ninety-six students and fourteen rectors to go. 
Students are partially to blame for this double imanity. They have been intimidated by authority. They have remained inactive in the face of chaos. Our course must be one of action both in America and Notre Dame. On this campus we have to show the 
administration that our talk of self-government will be backed by overt action. Power is what they understand. We must demand the immediate reinstatement of the four suspended students. We must demand that their cases be referred to our campus judicial board. 
We must seize what is rightfully ours. If we face this crisis with our customary inaction, we implicitly approve of Hesburgh's ex cathedra statements. We cannot tolerate the administration's present course. 
In the larger context of American society, we must act to structure the chaotic present in order to survive an irrational future. In New Hampshire, students worked for a political can­didate. Today, students for Kennedy and McCarthy are forming on every college campus. This is our only hope. This is our only viable alternative to the American madness. Inaction at Notre Dame 
becomes a wish for administrative tyranny. Inaction in American society becomes a wish for self-destruction -dropping out becomes equivalent to dropping dead.

Faculty Club Opens In May-be 
Sometime around the middle 
of May the mud will be gone, 
the ruts filled in, and the instant 
grass rolled into position. And 
then Notre Dame's new Faculty 
Club will begin operation. Such 
is the word from Mr. Fred Black

Inc., general contractor for· the 
project. 
The new Faculty Club, locaoo 
ted a few yards south of the Kel­

Upward Bound To Get Funds 
Congressman John Brademas, Democratic representative from Indiana's third Congressional Dis­trict, announced this weekend that Notre Dame will receive a $55,607 grant to continue its Upward Bound Program for boys. At a meeting at Saint Mary's he also announced that SMC will receive a $40,886 grant to begin its own program. 
Upward Bound is a program intended to help motivate high school students from poverty areas toward college. During sum­mer and semester breaks the college provides students with the experience of meeting col­
lege students, attending classes 
and meeting with guidance coun­
selors. The program is funded by 
the Office of Economic Q>por­
tunity. 
Notre Dame has had an Up­ward Bound Program since the summer of 1966. Twenty-six St. Joseph County boys have taken part in the program. Thir­ty-six more will begin the pro­gram this summer. 
Discussion at the meeting also centered around means of co­operation between the programs at Saint Mary's and Notre Dame. 
noon classes. 

It was expected that the new building would be completed sometime last fall; however, sev­eral obstacles have delayed con­struction. Mr. Black stated that his company had a han! time get­ting the wood deck roofing mat­
erial from the West Coast. The forest fires in California caused a four-month delay in logging op­erations on the West Coast. In turn, this delay caused the inter­ruption in the construction sche­dule for the club. 
For the interior of the club, a large, world-wide collection of beer steins donated by Mr. Rob­ert Gore will be used to decorate the inside walls, adding to the atmosphere. Mr. Gore, of Ft. Lauderdale, has also contributed the money for the construction of the club.

The Notre Dame Pentacostal Community will sponsor a confe­rence this weekend for Pen tacos­tal Communities in the Midwest­ern area. 
The weekend of prayer will begin Fri. night with an 8:30 prayer meeting in the adminis­tration building. An information­al meeting will be held 1 :00 Sat. in the classroom building behind Holy Cross Hall. 
The Pentacostal Movement began in the Catholic Church about 13 months ago. It began to spread at Notre Dame about a year ago after Doctor Bill Storey, a member of the Theo­logy Dept., and Ralph Kiefer, 
currently a Theology teacher at Saint Mary's, related the experi­ence that they had had with a Pentacostal Community in Pitts­burgh.

Dr. James Bogle of the Notre Dame Government Department filed the name of Senator Eu­gene J. McCarthy (Dem., Minn.) in the Indiana Primary at Indian­apolis Thursday afternoon. Com­menting on the entrance of Sen­ator Robert Kennedy (Dem., N. Y.) in the Primary, Bogle re­marked "It's a necessity that we beat Johnson, but it would be fun to beat the Kennedys." Bogle said McCarthy would ap­pear in Indiana on at least ten occasions, remarking "We're still in this thing all the way. Ken­nedy's entry hurt our chances of beating the Johnson stand­in Governor Branigan, but we still will make a fight out of it and, I hope, win."

Action at Tuesday's Bengal Bouts. Although the opening field of fifty-six hopefuls has now been narrowed down to twenty-two, local boxing buffs are unanimous in voicing their praise for the pugilistic prowess thus far exhibited in the Ring by both the victors and the vanquished. Tonight the champs meet the champs with gloves on in the Field­house in the 1968 final matches.

A special Bengal Bout Award will be part of the blood, sweat, and split deci­sions featured tonight in the Notre Dame Fieldhouse, The Award, resurrected after five years, has been given in the past to such boxing greats as Rocky Marciano, Billy Conn, Carmine Basilio, and Barney Ross. Non-boxers, such as Dave Condon and Elmer Layden, have also been singled ·out, since qualifications for the honor de­pends on service to boxing and to the Bcngals, not simply on a left or right 
hook. 

Dominic J. Napolitano, who has direc­ted the Bengals for the past 34 years, said that the award had been discarded until this year "because in recent years espe­cially, it has been difficult to find a man who has made a significant contribution to boxing in one way or another." 
But the Award will not be the biggest 
draw when the Bouts begin at 8:00. Three of last year's champions, Larry Broderick in the 135 class, Jim Loverde in the ISS class, and Bob McGrath in the 160 class, 
are still in the running for new letter jackets. Broderick, last year's 127 lb. champ, demonstrated some of his student power on Bob Oscar of New Jersey Wed.

Brian Murphy, most commonly known as the epitome of the Rugby team, lost a tough decision to Tom Breen in the 177 lb. division. Some observers thought that Murphy seemed uncomfortable "with

ted by his readers. So he gathers together his cohorts, they check 
with the local bookies, and all give roughly the same predictions, 
which tend to be rather redundant and dull. 
So it was with unspeakable pleasure that we received the prog­
nostications of Hugh Sonfirst, New Hampshire's most colorful 
sportswriter and sports editor of the Holdat Tiger. Hugh no longer 
follows the south, preferring his snug isolated little hamlet over the 
southern bullpens of iniquity. In fact, he no longer listens to the 
games, or reads the boxscores. But, since he once met Ty Cobb, he 
still gives his predictions, as he has done with characteristic Yankee 
ingenuity for the past 50 years. So, as a tribute to a grand old man, 
we are privileged to quote a few excerpts from Hugh's in depth 
article. First, the American League: 
St. Louis--"1 look for the Browns to take it all this year. You 
can say all you want about the recent Chicago Cub infield, Tinker 
to Evers to Chance, but you can't beat Christman to Friend to Arft. 
Also, Sportsman's Park is in a nice neighborhood." 
Philadelphia--"Connie Mack is not as young as he used to be. Anyone who would trade Nelson Potter to the Browns has got to be on the brink of senility. Without Potter on the mound, the $100,000 infield won't be 'worth a Continental.' " 
New York--"Ruth may have built the house but the other teams are going to break the windows. He and Gehrig are both gone and the dynasty is over. The Bronx Bombers, it is suspected, signed the Kellogg Pact. They may, however, get some help from that Italian kid." 
Boston--"Teddy Williams is too skinny to ever make it through a big league season." 
And the National League: 
New York--'.'John McGraw's Giants will again sweep the senior circuit if he can keep Jim Thorpe off the firewater. And, Christy Mathewson is still the best hurler in either league. If they can 
teach Fred Merkle how to catch, they've got a winner." 
Boston--"The Braves will be strong again this year. Wally Berger is the best player in baseball and Boston is a great two team town." 
Brooklyn--"These Bums couldn't win a pennant in a Coney lslan shooting gallery. They are so bad, in fact, that there will again be some question as towhich league they are actually in." 
Chicago--"As long as Wrigley keeps supplying his team with free chewing gum they will be too contented to win the pennant."
