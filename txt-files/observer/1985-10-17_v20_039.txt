Suspension of civil rights sparks conflict in Nicaragua 
AMoclated Press 
MANAGUA, Nicaragua -Opposi­tion leaders said yesterday the suspension of civil rights will inten­sify the war-like atmosphere in this leftist-ruled nation and may en­courage support for ll.S.-backed rebels. 
President Daniel Ortega an­nounced Tuesday night that free expression, public assembly and the right to strike had been suspended because of "brutal aggression" by the United States and "its internal allies" against the Sandlnista regl'ine. 
Ilis decree subjects Nicaraguans to Inspection of mail and search and seizure without warrant. Authorities have no obligation to relea'ie in­formation about those arrested. 
News media must submit their material to the Interior Ministry's director of communications before publication or broadcast. Similar rules have not affected foreign jour­nalists in the past, but the scope of the current decree was not clear im­mediately. 
La Prensa, the main opposition newspaper, had been required previously to submit material dealing with "military affairs and the nation's economic relations." 
Ortega said in a speech broadcast nationally, "In response to the ter­rorist politics ofthe United States ... internal pawns of imperialism sup­ported by some political parties, news media outlets and rdigious In­stitutions have redoubled their ac­tions to sabotage the defc~nse forces ofour nation. 

"It is a fundamental condition for the lifting of these (XCeptional measures that the imperialist aggres­sion against Nicaragua be effectively stopped." 
In Washington, Whnte House spokesman Larry Speake~> called Or­tega's action "a clear example of the Sandinistas tightening their contrQI of their country by violating basic freedoms and refusing Ito tolerate dissent" that rertlects "gmwing dis­illusionment with the Sandinista regime by large parts of the popula­tion and the Sandinistas' tear oftheir own people." 
"These individuals have trampled on civil liberties as very few countries have done in the past," he said yesterday. 
The United States backs Nicaraguan rebels, known as Con­teas, who operate from bases In Hon­duras and southern Nicaragua. 
The Sandinistas overthrew rightist President Anastasio Somoza in July 1979 and suspended most rights and constitutional guarantees when they declared a state of emer­gen<;y in March 1982. 
Ortega's government lifted the suspension in most cases shortly before national elections last November, when hundreds of foreign journalists and observers were In Nicaragua. 
Erick Ramirez, head of the Social Christian Party of Nicaragua; said yesterday that the government ac­tion "polarizes even more the situa­tion in Nicaragua, ends the few guarantees the Nicaraguan people have, increases the tension and jus­tifies the increase of the counter­revolution." 
Justice Minister Rodrigo Reyes insisted that the decree "preserves the intrinsic rights of the people, such as the right to life and physical integrity." 
Ortega did not mention specific military action by the Contras that may have prompted the suspension ofrights.

'Warmonger' perception of ROTC 
Weapon searches have been halted at Detroit's public schools pending a federal court hearing as to whether they are legal, the American Civil Uberties Union says. ACLU and school officials

reached an informal agreement concerning the searches in late Sep­
tember before U.S. district Judge Avern Cohn. The ACLU filed suit Sept. 1 7 on behalf of a female student who said she was unfairly patted down by a security officer. The suit argues that the random mass searches violate students' right to privacy. The checks began after a series of incidents in schools involving weapons. -AP 
Giant Strides in schooling since 194o "have 
made the American people the most educated in the world," but the quality of U.S. schools sagged in the 1970s, a Census Bureau study concluded yesterday. The special demographic study by two Census analysts also found evidence that the "return" on a college education ... the edge in earnings that college graduates have over high school graduates ... is growing again after shrinking in the 1970s. "Less than 45 years ago ... a solid majority of young adults were either high school dropouts or had never gone beyond elementary school," said the report. "Today ... high school dropouts have been reduced to a small minority." In 1940, only 38 percent ofthose ages 25 t~ 29 had attained a high school diploma, and a mere six percent had college 
degrees. -AP 
Merv Griffin surprised actor Robert Wagner by honoring him as the 25,000th guest star of his talk show, and Shelley Berman, who was the first guest in 1962, was on hand to share in the fes­tivities. After the taping of the show Tuesday for broadcast Oct. 24, the studio audience helped Griffin and Wagner eat a chocolate cake in the shape of25,000. "I've got my hand right in the icing," laughed Wagner as he cut the first piece. Griffin fed him the first bite, and Wagner ended up with green frosting on his nose. "I never thought it would go on this long," said Griffin, 60, who launched the show in October I 962. -AP

Little Richard, the '50s rock star who turned to religion in the '70s, was recoveringfrom surgery for a broken leg suffered in a car crash last week. "He's in stable condition.

The 52-year-old musician-turned-evangelist broke his right leg after his rented sports car crashed Oct. 8. He was driving with a suspended license, deputies said. Blood tests revealed no trace of alcohol. -AP 
Ann Landers, marking the 30th anniversary writing her column yesterday says she's learned to take readers' problems seriously without becoming a Miss Lonelyhearts. "There are problems today that no one could have predicted 30 years ago," Miss Landers, whose real name is Eppie Lederer, said. "AIDS Js an ex­ample. Also, the proliferation ofdivorce-all over the world." But the most frequent question remains,"What's the matter with me? I'm so lonely ... How can I make friends or fit in or do better?"

Sure you need a job. And a way to pay for school. A challenge. An adventure. Pay and benefits. But are you willing to risk your life or take some­body else's in order to get it? 
This excerpt, taken from a Philadelphia draft counsel­ing agency publication, epitomizes the sentiment many students on the Notre Dame campus hold toward the collegiate ROTC programs. And, until recently, I was one ofthese students. 
I, like many others, voiced the usual complaints about being awakened by early-morning Navy jogs around the lake, engaged in the usual "baby-killer" rhetoric, maintained that "Really Only Tuition Counts." ROTC was an alien organization to me, and I irrespon­sibly and rather smugly decided that I had no desire to investigate the motivations behind the scholarships. I categorized all ROTC cadets as warmongers or as military Faustian figures, selling their souls to Caspar Weinberger for four years of tuition. 
And then one of my best

desire to annihilate mankind. 
And it is. 

In the case of my friend, the motivation was originally, and admittedly, the tantalizing prospect of knowing that she would no longer have to spend hours completing guaranteed student loan applications or 
working in the dining hall. (And as someone who has worked there, I can assure you that the mere possibility ofescaping is enough to compel one to hop the nearest tank to the ROTC Building and enlist). But as she became more involved with the ROTC program at Notre Dame, stronger motivations and deeper convic­tions surfaced. John Fitzgerald Kennedy said, "Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your­country," and my friend cites this philosophy as similar to her own. "It's a personal challlenge and an oppor­tunity to do things most people don't do. It's a sense of not just living in the United States, but of working for and being a real part ofthis country."

Knowing this, I find it disturbing that normally apat­hetic Notre Dame students heckle the Irish Ranger Company while they drill by Juday Creek, calling them "warmongers" and, on special occasions, "warpigs." 
"You can't take that seriously," my friend says, "but it's upsetting when you're giving your all for something and people so misunderstand your motives." 
Perhaps on a campus such as Notre Dame, one might be inclined to think that such attitudes are quite under­standable. The deeply-rooted convictions of Chris­
tianity in the student body 

There is an inscription above the doors of Sacred Heart Church which reads "God, Country, Notre Dame," and my friend com­mented "I don't think the three are incompatible." After seeing her sincere commitment to the ideals that the three embody, I don't either.

Gorbachev adds new member to Politburo 

MOSCOW -Mikhail Gorbachev 

added another member of his 
economic team to the Kremlin 
leadership Tuesday and criticized 
"groundless fantasies" in past Com­
munist Party programs that charted 
the nation's course. 
A full session ofthe party's Central Committee named the new state planning chief, Nikolai Talyzin, a non-voting member of the Polit­buro. It also retired one of the last members of the old guard, former 
Health data of Americans released 
WASHINGTON -Blacks and other minorities are less healthy and die younger than whites, the govern­ment reported yesterday, but it said many of the estimated 60,000 early deaths that occur each year couldbe prevented. 
Health and Human Services Secretary Margaret Heckler, in releasing the report, said there is "a pronounced and stubborn dis­parity" between the health ofwhites and that of blacks and other minorities which has not ap­preciably narrowed in the years that statistics have been kept. 
She said approximately 80 per­cent of the early deaths result from cancer, heart disease and stroke, al­cohol and drug abuse, diabetes, in­fant mortality, accidents, or murder. 
Nevertheless, many of those early deaths, perhaps most ofthem, could be prevented by knowledge and change in personal habits, she said. 
"Smoking. alcohol, diet and obesity are clearly linked to the hig­her cancer, cirrhosis, cardiovas­
cular,  infant  mortality  and  other  
disease  rates  aftlicting  our  
minorities,"  she  said.  "And  

knowledge about the symptoms of disease can lead to early detection, early treatment and fewer deaths." 
She said she intends to shift $3 million in available funds to help implement the report's recom­mendation for greater education programs to alert minorities of the risk they face and to encourage changes in health habits. 
But she also said she would propose no big new federal program to confront the problem, saying it was unnecessary and, because of budget problems, unrealistic. 
"I do not believe that money is the answer," she said. "I do believe that knowledge ... as well as the target­ing of resources that already exist will very significantly narrow that gap." 
Heckler said she told the federal task force that compiled the report in advance that a big new federal program could not be one of its recommendations. The restriction originated from the White House, she said, but she added that the 
White House order dealt with all programs, not minority health specifically. 
She cited government efforts over the last 20 years to alert black Americans to their increased risk from high blood pressure. As a result, she said, stroke mortality among blacks dropped 51 percent from 1968 to 1982, and heart disease deaths dropped 42 percent. 
Still, the task force found that blacks continue to die of those causes at a higher rate than whites. 
The task force estimated that there are more than 18,000 excess deaths among blacks due to heart at­tack and stroke each year, compared with the number of deaths that would occur if their health was on par with whites. 
Premier Nikolai Tikhonov, from the ruling body, the news agency Tass reported. 
In a speech at the meeting. Gor­bachevlashed out atwhat he called a "dangerous turn" in U.S. foreign policy and said, "international developments have approached a line that cannot be passed without taking most responsible decisions. 
"These decisions cannot be put off without risking loss of control over the dangerous processes threatening mankind's very exis­tence," he said. 
The committee approved economic plans for 1986-90 and through the year 2000. The party also approved a draft edition of its "program" -a general outline of goals, ideology and policy that will be approved at a party congress set to begin Feb. 25. 
Details of the documents were not available, but the official news agency Tass said they would be published by the state-run press. 
Gorbachev said the party program "should be an exact formulation of the real process, explicitly spell out

The program was drafted by' a committee under Gorbachev's direction. In his speech, the general secretary made it clear that it would, as expected, drop many of the op­timistic promises included in the 1961 edition drafted under then­Premier Nikita Khrushchev.

Senate claims military joint chiefs 'obsolete,' asks for abolishment 
.MMdated Press 
WASHINGTON -The military 

Joint Chiefs ofStaff have become ob­
solete, unable to give effective 
advice, and should be abolished be­
cause they pose an obstacle to ef­
fective joint operations by the 
military services, a Senate staff 
report said yesterday. 
The report, the product of 2% 

years ofwork by the bipartisan staff 
of the Senate Armed Services Com­
mittee, recommends that the joint 
chiefs be replaced with a Joint 
Military Advisory Council. 
It would be composedoffive four­starofficers, each ofwhom would be on his last tour ofservice, in order to "create a source of truly indepen­dent military advice, uninhibited by service responsibilities and pressures." 
The ranking officers of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force would continue to head their services but would lose their role as direct military advisers. 
At present, the report said, the chiefs wear two hats, as military ad-

U.S. military to emphasize security 
WASHINGTON-Spurred by ter­

rorist attacks on three continents, 
the U,S armed forces are putting new 
emphasis on advising their person­
nel how to avoid making themselves 
inviting targets for attack. 
The advice comes against the 

background of the murders of four 
Marine embassy guards at an out­
door cafe in El Salvador in June, the 
slaying of Navy diver Robert Stet­
hem aboard a hijacked TWA jetliner 
in Beirut in July and a car-bombing 
that killed two people at the Rhein­
Main Air Base in West Germany in 
August. 
Many of the security tips fall into the realm of common sense and most are not new, but there has been a renewed emphasis on them, offi­cials say. The Army, for instance, in mid-September instructed com­mands worldwide to tighten security generally. 
Elaine Henrion, an Army spokes­woman, said soldiers going abroard also "are counseled a little bit" about making themselves less conspicuous in their appearance and behavior. 
Army Lt. Col. Arnold Williams, a public affairs specialist on terrorism for the Defense Department, said this involves cautions such as not to choose as off-duty apparel "cowboy hats with feathers in the band and belt buckles the size of pie plates" visers and service heads, and conse­quently are not able to do either job well. 
Identifying 34 problem areas, the report makes 91 spec~c recom­mendations for change, many aimed at improving the effectiveness of military operations involving more than one service. 
The committee was told the. cur­rent system is "fundementally flawed and in need of critical struc­tural reform." The report was unveiled at a com­
mittee  hearing  in  which  most  
members  .  agreed  change  has  
become essential.  

Nevertheless, debate flared ·over how radical that change should be. 
"There will be,those who say the system ain't broke, don't fix it," said Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz., the committee chairman who is a major general in the Air Force Reserve and was his party's 1964 presidential candidate. 
"However, itis broke and we need to fix it," said Goldwater, who is retiring at the end of his present term. "If we don't, our military ef­
and "not to congregate in a par­
ticular place habitually." 
Williams said an Army newspaper he edited in Germany ran regular security tips so that increased atten­tion to safety would not be taken as alarmist but simply an attempt to keep up the safety awareness of troops. 
AnAir Force spokesman, Capt.Jim O'Brien, said personnel in his service are given a "local threat briefing" upon their transfer to an overseas base. The service members are expected to pass these precau-

said. 

The servicewide directives 
followed immediate steps taken by 
some field commanders after ter­
rorist incidents. 

Because Stethem's military affilia­tion was uncovered by the fact he was traveling with an armed forces identification card and written or­ders instead of a passport, the com­mander of U.S. naval forces in Europe, Adm. Lee Baggett, ordered sailors and Marines in his region to obtain civilian passports. 
tectiveness will be seriously im­paired. Ifwe have to fight tomorrow, these problems will cause Americans to die unneccessarily. Even worse, they may cause us to lose the fight." 
Sen. John Warner, R-Va., a former secretary of the Navy, disagreed. He said some ofthe proposed remedies would subject the armed forces and the Pentagon to "open heart sur­gery." 
He also said Goldwater's charac­teristic outspoken candor may undermine morale and cause more 
damage. 

"I disagree with your bluntness in 
saying this system is broke," said 
Warner. "We must proceed with ex­
treme moderation and care... .I 
would suggest we not characterize 
the whole system as broke but act in 
a manner to preserve the morale of 
the armed services." 
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the com­mittee's ranking Democrat, said "the facts overwhelmingly establish that there are real problems." 


Vandiver execution prompts investigation 
Associated Press 

MICHIGAN City, Ind. -A prison vf­
ficial defended the procedures used 
to test the electric chair that took 
five jolts of voltage and 17 minutes 
yesterday to execute William Van­
diver for the stabbing and dismem­
berment ofhis father-in-law. 
The chair, however, wired 
directly to a nearby Northern In­
diana Public Service Co. power sub­
station, will be tested again soon, 
Department of Correction spokes­
woman Nancy Broglin said. 
"We are going to have that chair checked to reconfirm what we al­ready know ... that it was not mal­functioning in any way," she said. 
The 72-year-old wooden chair has been used for executions since it was fashioned from the gallows abandoned by the state in 1913 after 13 hangings.

"The chair has been used 61 
times, including last night, and has 
never failed, except sometimes it 
needs more than one application," 
Broglin said. 

The chair was tested three times 
before Vandiver's execution by a 
private contractor using 
"established electrical procedures," 
Broglin said. 

The offices ofstate prison Warden Jack Duckworth and Department of Correction Deputy Superintendent Cloid Schuler referred inquiries to Broglin, who had been appointed spokeswoman for the execution, and they did not return calls. 
Dr. Rodger Saylors of Michigan City pronounced Vandiver dead at 
12:20 a.m. Saylors said the first jolts of 2,300 volts for 10 seconds and 500 volts for 20 seconds left Van­diver brain dead but still breathing.

The six years of suffering have ,gone unnoticed 
Anti-apartheid week is over. Through posters, presentations and demonstrations, the student body has become painfully aware ofthe racial policies of the Bothagovernment. Most seem to feel it Is up to the United States and Its allies to put an end to the inhuman treatment of blacks In South Africa. On campuses nationwide, students are calling for economic sanctions on the part of this. country and private organizations. 
Alison Pivonka 
in print 
It is at this time, when awareness at Notre Dame ofsocial injustice is at its highest, that I propose a different kind of protest. Many of the same organizations which have responded to the call for divestment in South Africa con· tinue to maintain their interests in the Soviet Union, which is not only oppressive within Its borders but exports its violations of human rights to the Third World. 
I speak specifically of Afghanistan. While it is certainly not the only example of Soviet repression and cruelty, it Is a country whose nightmare began only very recently. The violence it has experienced has slipped past the media almost unnoticed. 
It began In 1973, when a military coup brought former prime minister Sardar Mohammed Daud back to power. Although he was not a Communist, Daud filled key govern· ment post.'i with individuals supportive of 
Soviet policies. He was assassinated by the 
army in 1978 and an unstable Communist 
regime was installed in the country. Afghanis· 
tan was invaded on December 27, 1979 by the 
Soviet Union. 
According to Jean-Francois Revel, former editor of L'Express, information about the condition ofAfghanistan is scarce not only be· cause of Soviet consorship but because of Western resistance. In his article "The Awful Logic ofGenocide" which appears in the Oct. 4, 1985 issue ofthe National Review, he states that one of the reasons for this resistance is that"... we ... spare ourselves from seeing it in order to excuse ourselves from having to oppose it." 
Reprinted in that same issue are portions of 
a report made by the U.S. Helsinki Watch 
Committee from a series of interviews with 
Afghan refugees. From these interviews the 
committee was able to discover information 
about the following: 
 A 21-year-old student arrested for distribut­ing "night letters" protesting the Soviet inva· sion. After his arrest, he was "hung by a belt until he was almost strangled, beaten until his face was twice its normal size, his hands crushed under the leg ofa chair ...." 
Two blind brothers in their nineties, who were unable to flee the village of Mata during the spring of 1984: "... the Russians came, tied dynamite to their backs, and blew them up ... 
" 
 A French doctor told of the punishment of an entire village after Afghan troops had defected: "They tied them up and piled them like wood. Then they poured gasoline over them and burned them alive ...." 

One former Soviet officer, Sergeant Igor Rykov, told the committee, "We did not take any prisoners of war. None. Generally we kilkd them on the spot." Other reports in· volve the dropping into residential areas of plastic toys which explode when children pick them up. The committee also docu­mented the mining of mosques, the booby­trapping of bodies and the use of poison gas. According to Revel, "... nearly 40 percent of the Jpopulation (since 1978) is either in exile, or dead." 
Such activity has been a reality in Afghanis· tan for nearly six years. Yet it was only inJuly 1985 that the U.S. Congress recognized the need to support the Afghan resistance. It seems that apartheid has for a time stolen the media spotlight from the Soviet Union. What we must remember is that a closed societysuf­fering such human rights abuses needs Wes· .tern attention as surely as does South Africa, if 
not more.

An editorial cartoon recently caught my eye. A baseball player is leaving a courthouse, a conspicuous trial of white powder behind him. A young fan, baseball glove in hand, cries out in dismay, "Say it ain't snow, joe!"

American baseball must return to its past

I commend the proposal of Baseball Com· misioner Peter Ueberroth that players take tests to show for drug use. Other professions use this procedure and the umpires have al· ready said that they would cooperate. The players have refused to do so, stating an inva· sion of their privacy. The players should now realize that it is time to clean up their house before there are anymore trials such as the one in Pittsburgh. 
People like Curtis Strong, the man who al­legedly supplied cocaine to the ·players, should be kept away from the ballparks and from the players. They are only parasites who feed on the players for their own personal gain. They are the ones who bring this dark shadow over baseball. 
As a society, we must move away from this glamourization of drugs like cocaine. We should not blindly accept the fact that drugs will remain an ugly spot in baseball. If we do that, the drug problem will only grow until it is out of.control. 
I want baseball to return to the way it was. A game played on a summer afternoon in a stadium filled with cheering fans. A game· winning home run sailing over the fence, a magnificent catch, a blazing fastball called a strike. I am tired of testimony and charges, of which players will be accused of using drugs next, of denials and allegations and courtrooms. 
I know that there arc farui out there who think the same way.

Quote of the day 

"A faithful friend is a sure shelter, whoever finds one has found a rare treasure. A faithful friend is something beyond price, there is no measuring his worth. Afaithful friend is the medicine of life, and those who fear the Lord will find one." 
Ecclesiasticus 6:14-17 
gave us a glimpse of greatness to come. A season when the Cubs lost all their starting pitchers and thirteen in a row in the process. A season where Billy came back to the Bronx and almost took the Yankees to the division title once more. All these images are over­shadowed by one that never took place on the playing field, but in a courthouse in Pit· tsburgh. A parade of baseball players with such names as Hernandez, Smith, Cabell and· 
Parker, coming out of the courthouse to be surrounded by the media. There were no questions about game-winning hits or pen· nant chances. These were questions about tes· timony and allegations. 1985 will be known as the year when baseball and cocaine were on trial. 
Something is wrong in America's game when this pushes the pennant races to the 


Doonesbury 
second page. But it is not something wrong 
with baseball only, but something wrong with 
our society. Drugs have now become fas· 
hionable in our day and age. Cocaine is now 
known as "the middle class high." Drug use in 
sporlts has become widespread. Drugs have 
thrown baseball, as well as other professional 
sports, into the spotlight ofnational scandal. 
For the young fans, this episode could be devastating. To see their heroes, those w~o they idolize and worship, rendered in an ar· tist's sketch 'testifying about their use of cocaine. This could break that young fan, realizing that his hero has done something wrong. If you cannot look up to that baseball play<:r, who can you look up to? Even worse, if that baseball player has been doing lines of cocaine, what can stop that young fan front sniffing glue in emulation ofhis hero? 
I r'emember when I was in grammar school and my father took me to our parish's sports banquet. The speaker that year was Greg Luzinski, then with the Philadelphia Phillies. They raffled off autographed baseballs, of whic:h I won one. I still have the baseball, the red ink is faded somewhat. Back then, that eleven-year-old boy was amazed and awestruck when I walked up to the podium to recic:ve it. From that day on until he retired, I followed the progress ofLuzinski in the sports pages. If I had read that Luzinski had testified to us,ing cocaine, that image ofhim as my hero woulld have been shattered. 
Could we accept a notion that such baseball grealtS like Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig were ad· dieted to cocaine? Could we accept the reason that the 1950 Philadelphia Phillies, "The Whiz Kids," lost the World Series be· cause they had gotten high on cocaine. No, I could not accept those kind of notions, Back then baseball was free of such things, but no

A new beginning? 
In recent years, student government has garnered little reaction from students except laughter. The Student Senate often has been ineffective and tied up by its own bureaucracy. 
Obviously, something needs to be done. Monday night, five student leaders, frustrated with the current situation and in the wake of last weekend's student leadership con­ference, decided to do something about the appalling status of student government. Their proposal to disband the Student Senate brought both jeers and cheers from stu­
dents. 

For most students, the first reaction to the proposal was that it is a power play on the part of Student Body President Bill Healy and the other student leaders. Based on the precedent of his administration this reaction is understandable. Healy's administration 
has a tendency to criticize in a reactionary manner. 
A closer look, however, will reveal that the acquisition of power is probably not the sole motivation for the action. Rather, the dominant motive seems to be frustration on the part ofstudent leaders who have been unable to lead. 
The five student leaders assume their inability to lead is inherent in the structure ofthe senate, so disbanding this body seems the obvious and immediate solution. But it must be examined whether the problemlieswith the structure ofstudent government orwith the leaders themselves. 
Will disbanding the senate make student government more effective? 
Monday night's actions were rash and the methods are questionable. The five leaders submitted their proposal to The Observer Monday night for publication, less than an hour after the Student Senate meeting. And yet no mention ofthe plan was made at the senate meeting. This is a poor reflection upon the integrity ofthe proposal. 
Similarly, while the leaders have taken the first step toward streamlining student government, they have not followed through with any viable alternative to replace that body. According to the student leaders, the Campus Life Council will become the new voice for students. While the CLC is recognized by the Board ofTrustees and the senate is not, in recent years this council has been untested as a student voice. 
Students should not support the proposal to disband the senate unless the five student leaders can present a viable alternative. Right now, what they are showing us does not appear to be any better. To disband one body without somethingworthwhile to replace it will only result in anarchy. And that's not going to do anybody any good. 
-The Observer 

The recent controversy over the labelingof Rock music records is all rather humorous. Besides shedding light on the insanities that public officials are concerned over, it is inter­esting to see how this current stir fits into the conservative, regulatory trend that has been sweeping the country. 
Brian Broderick 
sincerely yours 
Tipper Gore is leading this movement of momentous importance. She is the wife of Senator Albert Gore. There, now her identity should be sufficiently clear. Anyway, she seems to be suffering from the same ailment afilicting our beloved, if personally unknown to most of the campus, Student Body Presi­dent Bill Healy. They both like to see their names in the paper. Tipper Gore's next project will be to team up with Bill Healy. and aid him in his attempt to make those guys at The Observer open up the books. "Observergate" is an issue of campus-wide concern. 
Before I stray, let me address my central point: you cannot legislate morality. Gover­nor Mario Cuomo told us this last year when discussing the controversial issue ofabortion. Yet for the lack of anything better to do, the Tipper Gores ofthe world feel it is the govern­ment's duty to guide the children ofAmerican down the straight and narrow path. 
Her concern is justifiable. Ifmy spouse was an unknown senator, I would want publicity 



Cannot stop the music from being heard by all 
also. It is comparable to Bill Healy's plight of having nothing worthwhile to offer the campus so he will try to create a scandal. Wait there is a third parallel. I am the University of N~?tre Dame Administration. Let me introduce measures to regulate alcohol consumption on campus thereby reducing liability and impressing all of my conservative friends. 
My concern is not the lyric contect of songs. It is not whether or not The Observer is grossly corrupt. It is not whether or not al­cohol should be consumed on campus. What I do fear is this growing tendency in the United States of people regulating society. All of our moralistic friends are attacking symptoms ofa problem and not the root cause. Morality and ethics begin at home. If this fails then educa­tion is the answer. Morality must be taught by example, no forced upon the individual. Un­fortunately our elected officials are placed in a position oflosing their jobs if they do not bow to the pressure of groups like MADD or the new Parent Music Resource Center. 
Go ahead, tell twelve year-old Johnny the latest Motley Crue album has sexually explicit and violent lyrics. Now he is just more apt to buy the record. We all know how successful rating movies "R" has been in preventing those under eighteen from going to see movies.

'Should I stay or should I go' one must answer 
Going abroad? Considering it? This article is dedicated to those Southern-bound students or future Eurofreaks who are "Clashing" with that crucial question, "Should I stay or should I go?" 
Barbara Grant and Katy Spalding 
guest column 
Life in these United States is not always all it is cracked up to be, now is it? Let us be honest. Baseball, hot dogs, apple pie and Chevrolet pale in comparison to Jai Alai, bratwurst, French pastries and Mercedes. Of cou~se, there is always the issue ofwhether or not one wants to forfeit a year at Notre Dame, with football weekends, SYRs, good friends and the dome. And if you are in certain major se­quences, chances are that your advisor will tell you it is impractical and practically impos­sible to spend a year abroad. 
Many things in life that are worthwhile re­quires some amount of work, sacrifice and risk. No one goes away from home, goes on to better relationships or matures without leaving some things, some one or some place behind and taking a chance. It is hard once you have begun to be comfortable to take a big risk and go light-years away · to another country, another culture, another university, another a-lot-of-things. 
But how will I fit in "over there"? What if I do not like enchiladas or tea at 4? Do I really have to go a whole year without drinking the water? How will I ever survive on just two showers a week? These questions and a mil­lion more may or will be going through your minds before that fateful day arrives when you step on the plane and head towards that "foreign place." No matter to which foreign studies program you sell your soul, you will all be wondering basically the same things. 
Yes, it is true. France, England, Mexico, Japan, even Israel -they are all civilized countries. They do have indoor plumbing with flushing toilets; they do sell toothpaste and deodorant; and if you want to, you can probably listen to the latest top forty hits on the radio while catching Dynasty on cable TV. Of course, one must realize that these countries and their people are indeed foreign to us. Life will be different, and therein lies all the excitement. 
Being in Mexico for a year I learned about 
many of the advantages of my own country 
from a totally new perspective. I was on the 

outside, and reading Excelsior, or The Daily News. I was often amazed at what the U.S. government was doing and how the United States was perceived in Latin America. As I became more critical of U.S. foreign policy, I became more appreciative of the internal protection and freedom which we, as Americans, enjoy. 
Being in France can be quite unsettli~ag at times -especially when I looked at the world map in my classroom and saw myself in Angers and the United States an entire ocean away. What a completely new view of the world I had. The Germans and the Spaniards were my neighbors. I had Italian and English and, of course, French friends. It may sound sappy, but I found hope for a peaceful world rooted in these relationships. 
So, do not let the fear ofthat final interview, or your grades in 121F, discourage you from going through with the adventure. Even if you only know how to say "Guten Tag," or "Donde esta el bano?" you can always find someone who is excited that you are trying to learn his or her language, (even in France). And you will, if you try, actually be able to understand the teachers after awhile. Do not let the nightmares scare you, either; even if you are stranded at Mexico City International, or in Zurich in Switzerland, or at Orly in Paris · do not be too concerned. You will live, and those things later on make great stories. 
A year aborad can feel like an awfully long time, it is true. And it may not always feel like the "best year ofyour life." But in the end, it is really worth i-t. You will have discovered people, places, and a part of yourself that you never knew existed. You will have gained a new perspective on your life as an American and as a student at Notre Dame. And after all, everyone knows that those who have been abroad are the "coolest" people on campus, n'est-ce pas?

What Geraldine Ferraro's historic first has done? 
When I was little, I wanted to be a priest. I wanted to teach children about God the way the priests in my parish did and Iwanted to be a leader of my church community. I did not think I would have any trouble being ac­cepted into the seminary and becoming a priest. After all, I had almost every part of the mass memorized. Not only did I know all of the responses and most ofwhat the priestsaid, but I thought that with a little work, I could know every reading and gospel and be able to talk about them. ·

guest column 
Little did I know that women were not and still are not allowed to be priests or celebrate the Eucharist in the Catholic Church. Nor did I have any idea of the many limitations and discriminations in other fields that women faced as they were seeking careers. 
In last year's presidential election, Walter Mondale, Geraldine Ferraro, and the Democratic-Party made history when Ferraro was named the Democrat's vice-presidential candidate. That the idea had even occurred to presidential candidates Mondale and Gary Hartwas a giant step in itself, accordingto Fer­raro in her new book, "Ferraro: My Story," ex­cerpted in Newsweek recently. 
The Democrats hailed 1984 as "the time for a woman vice-presidential candidate." For Ferraro, that meant opportunities and ex­periences beyond anything she had ever en­countered. For the millions of women in America struggling to be recognized by society inbusiness, politics and the home, this declaration was like winning the semi-finals of a match. Sure, there would be some tough op­position to face before emerging victorious, but their game plan was finally paying off. They had climbed one more step on the lad­der ofrecognition. 
As the first woman vice-presidential can­didate on a major political party's ticket, Ferraro and her campaign changed the way society perceives what is possible for women today. America saw this Queens' Congres­swoman with only six years of experience cope with the pressures of traveling, cam­paigning and press conferences with strength and confidence equal to any man's. They sawa woman intensely dedicated to her career but equally dedicated to her family. 

Ferraro confronted each obstacle in her life as a fighter-not as a "woman" or as a "man". Her philosophy is one that can only lead to success: "You work hard, you prepare, you give it your all, and within a short time, you're on top ofit." It never mattered to Ferraro that she was a woman in a man's world. She had her job, completed it well, and was rewarded. She learned from others and used her knowledge to further her career. 
So, what do Ferraro's accomplishments and mywanting to be apriest have to do with each other? A lot. 
I wanted to be a priest and it never oc­'curred to me that I could not be one because I was female. I feel that, eventually, the chance for women to be priests will be much greater than it is at the present time. That chance will be the result of tremendous work on the part of women's interest groups. The woman chosenas the first priest will play a role similar to the one Ferraro is playing. She will make history in the Catholic Church just as Ferraro did in the American government. Ferraro has set the precedent for this woman. 
Ferraro's candidacy was a huge step for womankind. Not only did itcreate a legacy for 
women in politics to follow, but it emphasized 
the idea that women are capable of handling 
any position men can. It removed more stones 
from the walls blocking women in their 
careers today. 

If a woman is qualified for a position, is 
motivated to complete her job well and works 
for her position, she will be successful. She 
may not encounter success immediately and 
achieving that success may be tough, but it is 
more realistic now than it has ever been. Now 
it is a possibility, whereas before it was a 
dream. 

That is not to saythat in the near future a woman will be ordained as a priest ifshe really wants to be one and works hard to attain that goal. Who is to say when that will happen? It does indicate, though, that some seeds have been planted, and that the ideas and results which generate from them are the future. 
IfI have a daughter, she may never be the Pope and live at the Vatican. But, thanks to Ferraro and her role in the 1984 election, she may very well be the President of the United States, seated in the Oval Office.

ontrary so popular belief, 
people who go into the Notre 
Dame Radiation Research 
Laboratory are not swallowed up 
for all eternity by this edifice. 
According to Robert Schuler, 
director ofthe ndiation laboratory, 
the primary purpose ofthe lab is "to 
try to understand the intermediates 
produced by radiation." 
The radiation laboratory was built by the Notre Dame science department because ofits involve­ment in various electron accelera­tion projects since 1936. Notre Dame's chemistry department was considered the most competant by the federal government to conduct research in the radiation chemistry field, because of the laboratory's long time interest in the field. 
Schuler is the radiation 
laboratory's third director, and took 
office in 1976. john McGee held the 
position ofdirector from 1970 until 
1976 and Milton Burton preceeded 
him as director from 1963. 
The laboratory's projects have 
been governmentally funded since 
1946. The Atomic Energy Commi­
sion was the primary source of 
these finances at that time. 
Notre Dame's radiation 
laboratory is the principle research 
area for radiation chemistry 
nationwide. The two other 
laboratories are the Argon National 
Laboratory and the Brookhaven 
National Laboratory. According to 
Schuler, "This (Notre Dame's) 
radiation laboratory is the best and 
the largest." 
Associate Director, R. W. Fessen­
den, said that "We study the 
properties ofreactive chemical 
molecules which have short 
lifetimes. This process is studied 
through a technique called lasar 
photolysis which produces pre­
radials in a short time." 
Schuler elaborated upon this, 
"We are mea!iuring how fast the 
reactions occur that are produced 
by various types ofradiation, and 
what the nature ofthe inter­
mediates is. These reactions occur 
in a millionth ofa second or 
shorter." 
"The most significant recent 
developement was ofa special technique by which our scientists looked at the way molecules, produced by radiation, vibrate. This experiment provides information on the structure and the manner in which these molecules react," Schuler said. 
The experiments at the radiation laboratory are researched through the use ofspecial equipment which utilizes electron acceleration and 

There is absolutely no threat of radia­tion harming anyone in the lab or on campus. The thick wall structure prevents any leakage, and there are numerous other electric monitors to warn workers when radiation is present. 
lasers to produce reactions in a 
billionth ofa second. Devices which analyze the products ofthe 
reaction by their light absorption and emission properties are also used to conduct experiments. 
Fessenden offered another ex­ample ofresearch methods, "In 1981 the rate ofthe reaction of electrons and oxygen molecules was investigated by using microwaves." 
The radiation laboratory is now funded in part by the United States Department ofEnergy. The amount received equals S3.5 million a year. This amount supports the research and the purchase of major equip­ment items. 
The government is not involved in any specific projects; it simply supports the basic research at the lab. "Their interest is that these results will eventually be useful. The purpose ofour work is not to develop specific devices; that comes at a later stage. We provide the principles, and it is up to other 
researchers to use these prin­ciples," said Fessenden. 
Once a year, over a three day interval, government observers examine the scientific progress of the laboratory. "Most ofthe pressure to perform quality experi­ments is generated in one's self. If we conduct good research then there is no pressure to mass produce experiments. Each scien­tist is his own best critic," said Schuler. 
Approximately I 00 people work at the radiation laboratory, and they are all on Notre Dame's payroll. Two glass blowers, and an electrical technician are included among the ranks employed at the radiation laboratory. 
Presently, there are six under­graduate students and l 5 graduate students employed at the lab. Two of the undergraduates actually operate accelerators which are vital to many of the experiments. 
These undergraduates are on work-study (arranged through financial aid) while the graduate students are earning academia credit while working for their doc­tecate degrees. 
Most ofthe graduate students received their degrees in chemistry. Each student chooses a specific area to study, and they go through a standard procedure for chemistry graduate students. They apply for positions to assist a professor, and then students are accepted on the basis ofvarious factors involved in this admission process. 
Hugh McManus, a chc:mistry graduate student, is now working at the radiation laboratory. His under­graduate degree is from Maynooth College in Ireland, and his major was physical chemistry. He now works a minimum 70 hour week, and he earns J650 per month. McManus' tuition is free also. 
McManus' job includes running experiments, analyzing the results and planning new experiments. His advisor, Fessenden, is responsible for overseeing McManus' indepen­dant work. "I enjoy the research part of my job the most," McManus said. 
"Most people are curious as to what goes on in here. With the opaque windows and the fact that it

The Romantics next song · "Talking In Your Sleep" · made it big. "Talking In Your Sleep" always bothered me though because a) it sounds too much like Rick james' "Superfreak" b) the video for it revealed the members ofthe Romantics as having more hair combined than the entire popula· tion ofEthiopia and c) my 6-year­old sister walked around the house singing it. This takes away from a 
song. 
Rhythm Romance is the Roman­tics' new album and it is disappoint­ing. The problem is that the Romantics' style is so infectious that I found myself liking every song as it came up. In retrospect though, they all sound the same. 
"I Got It If You Want It" is a per· fect example ofwmt I mean. It is a competently written power pop sontt but it sounds like every other song on this album. It could have benefitted from a slowing down, a 
piano, and a lonely slide guitar. It could have been a great country-ish rock song, but the Romantics give it the same old treatment. 
Even though every track is mad· deningly similar, each one is also obnoxiously danceable. From these grooves springs not originality, but familiarity. You can sing along after two listenings. I just hope my little sister hasn't heard it yet.

Perfect record is first-time thing for Payton 
LAKE FOREST, Ill.-Don't ask Walter Payton how he feels about the Chicago Bears being 6-0 In the National Football League. 
"I've never been in this situation before," said the league's all-time leading rusher. "Not in high school, not in college. It's all new to me." 
Payton gained 132 yards and scored two touchdowns in Sunday's 26-1 0 victory over the San Francisco 49ers. 
It was the 65th time in his 11-year career that he has gone over 100 yards in a game, but he acknowledged there is added pressure with the team's surprising winning streak. 
"There's more pressure every week," Payton said. "Every game becomes more pressing. It's something you have to get used to." 
Is he surprised at the Bears' great start? 
"I'm surprised every day I wake up. We've accomplished a lot through hard work and we can't let down. Our coaches won't allow this team to let down." 
Payton, who seven years ago said he planned to play only"three or four more years," refuses to say how much longer he plans to stay in the game. 
"Any time you can play football after a few years is icing on the cake," said the 31-year-old Payton, one ofthe league's most durable players during a career in which he has amassed 13,731 yards rus­hing. 
"I'm happy. We've been a team that has struggled. Finally, we're here and I want to be a small part ofstaying here." 
The Bears no longer are the one-dimensional team ofleaner years, when they had little going for them but the churning legs of Walter Payton. 
Quarterbackjim McMahon has seen to that, with his ability to get points quickly with the passing game. 
"Jim adds a certain flare to the game," said Payton. "With his presence, a lot ofteams can't key on certain situations. We have a lot oftalent and teams no longer can key on us."

pitching they needed for the third straight game. 
In the final three games of the series, Toronto stranded 26 runners, 1 7 in scoring position. The Blue Jays, who hit just a shade under .300 with runners in scoring position during the regular season, stranded nine runners in their final game of the year, including six in scoring posi­tion. 
Saberhagen, the Royals ace and one ofonly two 20-game winners in the American League, was forced to leave after three innings. He bruised his pitching hand in the first inning while trying to grab an infield hit by Willie Upshaw.

homer by Mike Marshall in the eighth. 
·Facing the Dodgers' ace reliever, Tom Niedenfuer, the Cardinals started their winning rally with one out in the ninth on a single by Willie McGee, who came into the game with only four hits in 21 playoff at bats. 
McGee stole second and Nieden­fuer then walked Smith, whose ninth-inning homer in Game 5 had beaten the Dodger reliever. 
Abouncing ball to first by Tommy Herr sent the runners to second and third, and Clark, the Cardinals' cleanup hitter, hit the first pitch deep into the left field stands as Dodger leftfielder Pedro Guerrero watched helplessly. 
Guerrero threw his mitt to the ground in disgust and the Cardinals poured out of their dugout to welcome Clark, who had only one previous RBI in the series. 
The hit put the Cardinals in only their second World Series since

divisional play was instituted in 1969. The Cardinals won the 1982 World Series over Milwaukee in seven games. 
The winning pitcher yesterday was rookie right-hander Todd Wor­rell, who gave up Marshall's eight­inning homer, and left-bander Ken Dayley pitched the ninth inning to save it for the Cardinals. 
This was a contest settled bet­ween the bullpens ofthe two teams. Dodgers starter Orel Hershiser worked 6 1-3 innings and the St. Louis starter, Joaquin Andujar, went six innings, neither pitching very ef­fectively. 
Hershiser beat Andujar in Game 2 in Los Angeles, but that was the last game the Dodgers would win in this series. The Cardinals swept three at home, winning 4-2, 12-2 and 3·2 befure returning to Los Angeles for what would be the final game ofthe playoffs. 
Hershiser gave up a run in the third, then was chased in the seventh after McGee's two-run single. Andujar gave up runs in the first and second innings, and Bill Madlock's solo homer, his third of the playoffs, capped a two-run fifth. 
Besides his home run, Madlock also drove in a run with a single, and Mariano Duncan had three hits, an 
RBI  and  scored  twice  for  the  
Dodgers.  
In  the  Cardinal  seventh,  Smith  

drove"in the tying run in a dramatic remat~h against Niedenfuer. Smith had hit the first left-handed home run of his career to beat Niedenfuer and the Dodgers in the bottom ofthe ninth inning in Game 5. 
Darrell Poner and Tito Landrum got the Cardinals' seventh going with consecutive singles off Her­shiser. A bouncer to first by pinch­hitter Steve Braun advanced the runners, and McGee punched a two­run single up the middle, chasing Hershiser. 
That brought on Niedenfuer for the rematch with Smith. Smith took a ball and a strike from Niedenfuer before ripping a line drive into the right-field corner. For a split second, it looked like it might also go out of the park, but it bounced up against the fence for a triple, and McGee scored the tying run from first base. 
said I..averie, "but I'm not sure be· 
cause Saint Mary's does not have a 
representative on the seeding com­
mittee." 
Probable candidates for high seeds are the No. 2, 3 and 6 singles players, Boyd, Drahota and Szajko, respectively. 
"Sheila Campbell and Shaun Boyd have a good chance ofgetting a high seed position as a doubles team," noted I..averie. 
I..averie asserted that her team is physically prepared fur districts, but they have to get themselves men­tally prepared. 
"If we go out there with con­fidence in ourselves and know how good we are, we'll win." 
Niedenfuer walked Tommy Herr 

intentionally and then got out ofthe 
inning by fanning Clark and Andy 
Van Slyke in succession. 
The Dodgers were clinging to a 2­

1 lead when Duncan came out to 
lead off the fifth inning against An­
dujar. Duncan hit a high bouncer off 
the hard dirt in front ofthe plate and 
toward the mound. Andujar ap­
peared to lose the ball in the bright 
sun, and when he dropped it fur an 
error, Duncan was safe at first. 
Duncan then stole second, went 

to third on a ground ball and scored 
on a sacrifice fly to center by Guer­
rero. The rainbow throw to home by 
McGee was well late of Duncan's ar­
rival at the plate. 
Madlock, the next hitter, then took a called strike from Andujar before lofting a pitch into the left­field bleachers, making the score 4­
1. Madlock, acquired in trade from Pittsburgh on Aug. 31, had seven playoff RBI. 
The day started poorly for An­dujar and quickly got worse. When he took the mound to start the game, the resin bag fell apart in his hands, then he caused a 10-minute delay to fill in some holes in front of the pitching rubber. · 
When he finally was ready to pitch, Duncan led off with a double down the right-field line and went to third on a fly ball to deep left field by Ken I..andreaux. After Guerrero popped out, Madlock got a single up the middle that scored Duncan, and the Dodgers led 1-0. 
Andujar pitched his. first 1-2-3 in­ning in the third, getting Guerrero to pop up, striking out Madlock on three pitches and inducing Marshall to line out to Landrum in left. 
Landrum was starting his third straight playoff game in left field, substituting for the injured Vince Coleman. Coleman hurt his left leg before Game 4 Sunday when it got caught under the metal cylinder that automatically rolls the tarp onto the field at Busch Stadium. 
Coleman took batting practice Wednesday, but Cardinals Manager Whitey Herzog said before the game, "He's obviously too sore to play today, and if there Is a seventh game, he would be questionable."

As a senior at McQuaidJesuit High School in Rochester, N.Y., his cross­country team finished second in the state. Warth also placed second in the mile in the state track champion­ships. 
As a sophomore at Notre Dame, he placed second in the 10,000 meter race at the Indiana State track meet. The team also happened to finish second in the meet. 
As a junior, the Notre Dame cross­country team won the Indiana Inter­collegiate state meet. But, as Warth's luck would have it, he did not run in that race. 
Tomorrow, the Irish travel to Bloomington for the Indiana Inter­collegiate state meet. Warth, who will definitely run, believes that things have to change. 
"I'm tired of seconds," he said. "I want the team to win this state meet. I couldn't take another second." 
Warth, known as "Silky" to his teammates, is not one to quit. He is in his fourth year as a cross-country runner but only his first as one ofthe top seven runners. 
"The last two seasons, sophomore and junior, were very frustrating," Warth noted. "I was always on the threshold of breaking into the top seven, but then I would have one or two bad races." 
Warth began his running career his freshman year at McQuaid Jesuit by joining the cross-country team. He enjoyed it so much that he later joined both the indoor and outdoor track teams. He has never stopped running both sports. 
"I feel that cross country and track compliment each other," said

Simon and the O.C. Crime defense. 
In their 3-0 win Saturday against Keenan, Tom Walker scored twice and Tom White chipped in with a goal of his own to lead the Crime's attack. Manny Maldanado and Dave Simon led the way Monday night against Zahm 'A', in their 2-0 season finale. The experienced Crime are looking forward to playing in the new double elimination playoff for­mat and should go far after playing in one of the tougher divisions in the program. 
Stanford was the third undefeated team after the regular season, taking their 5-0 mark all the way to the top of the East European League. On Sunday, the Studs took it to the Dil­lon I squad and won, 2-0. 
"It was our toughest game of the season, but it was also fun to play," said Stanford captain Jim Byrne. "Tom Zibelli's second-half goal was the best I've seen in all my years of interhall play." 
Dave Stevenson provided the ot­her goal in the first half. 
Stevenson and Zibelli teamed up again on Monday night, as Zibelli notched a hat trick and Stevenson added the balance in Stanford's 5-0 pasting ofHoly Cross 'B'. 
Although the Studs are talented, their 5-0 mark is probably the weakest of the three undefeated teams. Byrne openly wonders about his team's strength in comparison to other playoff teams. 
Warth. "I love the variety of cross country, running on different courses every week, and I love the precision oftrack, running BOO's and 1600's." 
Warth planned on attending Notre Dame. Though not recruited, he contacted Irish cross country Head CoachJoe Plane several times. Piane would ask about Warth's times and set goals for him during track season. 
"I was also a two miler in high school," explained Warth. "Plane said I should be running a 9:20 two­mile. The first time out, that's what I ran,a9:20." 
Piane has watched Warth develop over the years through hard work. 
"I told him that he would have to invest a year or two to develop," noted Plane. "That's what he really needed. 
"Warth, along with Jim Tyler and John Magill, are three of the most dedicated runners," continued Plane. "They have been extremely faithful to the program. Warth and Magill are especially a tribute to hard work. They justdon't have the wall-to-wall talent like other run­ners." 
In the four years Warth has been a member ofthe team, he has seen the team evolve. 
"In freshman year it really wasn't fun to run," he said. "It seemed we were competing against each other instead of with each other. But things gradually changed around, and the team has held together." 
Warth, a government major, wanted to spend a semester in Lon­don during his junior year. After dis­cussing the matter with Piane, Warth decided to go the second semester and miss track season rat­her than missing cross country. 
In this his senior year, Warth sees his role on the team as a leader by example, though he is not a co­captain. He also expects a certain level of performance from himself every time he runs. 
"Really I try to run · with Markezich, Magill and Garrett," he said. "Basically I just want to be a better part of the group." 
Warth has run well thus far. His best finish was in the National Cat­holic meet, where he placed 16th overall and third on the team. 
He is definitely looking forward to the state meet tomorrow as he would like something better than second-best. The competition, though, promises not to be too kind. 
Indiana is the featured team in this meet, powered by five strong recruits and ranked 15th in the na­tion. However, the Hoosiers were recently upset by Purdue in the Mar­quette Invitational so the Boiler­makers also promise to be strong competition. 
Piane hopes that the Notre Dame Invitational disaster is behind the team. 
"We have got to run more ag­gressively as a group," noted Piane. "Ifwe are as aggressive as we were in the National Catholic, then we should do alright. If we don't, we'll get hammered. 
The team should be boosted by the return of Mike Collins to the lineup. Collins, who has missed the first three races with a foot injury, has finally been cleared to run. Dan Garrett, however, still remains sidelined with a hip injury. 
The following Friday, the Irish will travel to Indianapolis for the Midwestern Collegiate Conference championships. Notre Dame, Oral Roberts, and Loyola (Chi.) favored in that race. 
Senior cross-country runner Tom Warth, sboum here in action earlier in the season, should figure prominently in the Indiana Intercollegiate state meet this weekend. Pete Gegen features Warth andpreviews the meet in his story above.

Cardinals and Royals will meet in World Series 
K.C. overcomes 3-1 deficit, topples Toronto in game 7 
TORONTO -The Kansas City Royals, the team that would not quit, completed a stunning turnaround last night by beating the Toronto Blue jays 6-2 behind jim Sundberg's four RBI to win the decisive seventh game of the American League playoffs and advance to the World Series. 
The victory set up an all-Missouri, Show-Me Showdown in the World Series starting Saturday night in Kansas City between the Royals and the St. Louis Cardinals, who won the National League pennant earlier yes­terday by beating Los Angeles, 7-5. 
"fbe Royals iced their comeback from a three games-to-one deficit when Sundberg drove in three runs with a bases-loaded triple off the top of the right field wall in the sixth in­ning. 
Thus ended Canada's hopes for the first World Series outside the United States. 
In any other year since divisional playoffs began in 1969, Toronto would have won, three games to one. But this year, for the first time, it was a best-of-seven format, not best­of-five, and the Royals took full advantage of the extra two games. 
Sundberg finished the series with a team-high six RBI, one more than teammate George Brett, the playoff Most Valuable Player who had eight hits including three home runs in 23 at-bats. 
Kansas City's victory reversed AL east dominance in recent league playoffs. The 1980 Royals were the last AL west team to win a playoff and the Oakland teams of 1972·73· 74 were the only other Western representatives to win since divisional play began. 
Only four times in World Series history have teams rallied from 3-1 deficits. Of the 33 clubs that trailed by that margin, only Pittsburgh in 1925 and 1979, the New York Yankees in 1958 and the Detroit Tigers in 1968 came back to win. 
The Royals won the game by rip­ping Dave Stieb, who led the league in earned run average this season. Stieb, who won the opener and pitched powerfully despite getting no decision in Game 4, left the game after Sundberg's triple. 
Stieb was charged with six'earned runs, his second-highest total of the season. 
Kansas City starter Bret Saber­hagen, winner Charlie Leibrandt and Dan Quisenberry, who got the final two outs, gave the Royals the clutch

Clark homer seals victory for St. Louis 
Associated Press 

LOS ANGELES · jack Clark, ac­quired in the offseason to put some power in a lineup built on speed, hit a three-run home run with two out in the ninth inning to give St. Louis a 7-5 victory over Los Angeles yester­day and send the Cardinals to their 14th World Series. 
Twice, the Cardinals fought back 
from deficits to beat the Dodgers in 
the sixth game of the National 
League playoffs for the right to meet 
the winner of the American league 
playoff between Kansas City and 
Toronto. 

The Cardinals thus completed a 
four-game sweep of the Dodgers 
after losing the first two games. 
Ozzie Smith, the playoff Most Valuable Player who had won the ftfth game with a ninth-inning homer, capped a three-run seventh with a run-scoring triple that tied the score 4-4, but the Dodgers regained the lead on a lead-off

Things are looking better for Irish receivers 
Monday evening, after two ofhis wide receivers had suf­fered minor injuries during practice, Notre Dame offensive coordinator Mike Stock wondered aloud ifthe Irish might be better off using a full-house backfield in Saturday's game against Army. It wasn't a serious thought, but with the in­jury problems that have hampered the wideouts lately, it might not have been a bad idea to. put more running backs on the field and protect the receivers that were left. 
Fortunately for the Irish, things have gotten a little better since then. The Monday injuries · split end Reggie Ward's bruised shoulder'and flanker Pat Cusack's twisted ankle · apparently were not serious, and both should be back in time for the Army game. 
Split end Tim Brown, meanwhile, has been recovering well from the ankle injury he suffered against Purdue and figures to see some playing time Saturday. Add Alvin Miller, who appears to be rounding into form after a pre-season injury, and the picture appears even brighter. 
"With the stretch of seven games that we have coming up, it's good to be over the injury problems and to have a solid three-man rotation," says Stock, referring to Brown, Ward, and Miller. "They've all been hurt, but the nature of the injuries is such that those players won't be kept out of games. Some will just have to play sparingly." 
Ward currently leads the team with 11 receptions for I 58 yards, while Brown is second with nine catches for 150 yards., despite sitting out last week's game. Miller, who has played in only two games so far, chalked up four ofhis five receptions last week against Air Force. 
Stock can take consolation in the fact that Cusack and sophomore Tony Eason will be there to pick up the slack when needed, and both have done that so far. Eason, who started at split end in the season opener against Michigan, has hauled in six passes for 101 yards and has Notre Dame's only touchdown reception of the season. Cusack, who got 

Larry Burke 
Football Notebook 
the starting nod at flanker in the Air Force game, has caught three passes in '85. 
"Injury problems are going to come up," says Stock, "so it helps to have quality personnel like Eason and Cusack that can step in and do the job." 
Freshman Mark Green has also proven that he is capable of doing the job when called upon. Green recently made the move from tailback to flanker, and while he still has a lot to learn, he has shown good speed and an impressive ability to catch passes in traffic. 
"We moved Mark to wide receiver for two reasons," ex­plains Stock. "First, so that he could travel with the team at that position while being a return man on special teams, and second because we felt we had depth at the tailback spot at that time. As things turned out, Alonzo jeffersonwas injured soon after that, but what we wanted to do at that time was find a spot for Mark where he could help the team right away." 
Green caught four passes for 39 yards against Air Force when he was pressed into duty as a backup to Cusack at flanker because ofBrown's injury. 
"Against Air Force, Mark made a couple of exceptional catches on third down that helped us keep drives alive," Stock recalls. "Two of his catches were exemplary · there were defenders right in the vicinity to make the hit im· mediately after the catch. 
"He's been a quick learner at the position, but he still has 
to get his feet wet -he's got a lot more to learn. He's 
progressing well, though, better than most freshmen 
would, and he's definitely a gifted athlete. 
"He's a wide receiver right now, but down the road he could end up back at running back again." 
While the situation at wide receiver has been good and appears to be getting better, the tight end spot has been a weakness in the Irish attack. junior Tom Rehder will be the starter there Saturday, backed up by freshman Andy Heck. junior joel Williams, the starter in Notre Dame's last two games, has dropped to the number three spot. 
Stock assessed the performance ofthe tight ends so far as "fair," but noted that no one position has been the cause of Notre Dame's offensive problems this season. 
"It's been a variety of things," explains Stock. "Against Air Force, we had things happen in the 'red area,' inside their 20-yard line. It's just a matter of getting every phase, every particular aspect together and getting them on the same page to achieve total efficiency. We've got to eliminate mental mistakes and move toward cohesive­ness." 
EXTRA POINTS -Tailback Allen Pinkett needs only 50 more rushing yards to pass Vagas Ferguson's 3,472-yard total and become Notre Dame's all-time leading rus­her. Kickoff for the Army game is slated for 11:38 
a.m. local time. The Television Enterprise will televise the game, along with USA Network and WNDU. Injury report: Inside linebacker Mike Kovaleski (torn thigh muscle vs. Air Force) has been doing some running this week but is still listed as questionable for Army. Outside linebacker Mike Larkin (sprained ankle vs. Michigan State) and Brown are listed as probable for Saturday.
