Clinton poised to send 1994 fiscal budget proposal to Congress 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Presi­dent Clinton sends Congress his first full-scale federal budget Thursday, a $1.51 trillion spending plan guaranteed a se­rious -if not necessarily smooth -reception in the Democratic-led body. 
The Clinton fiscal 1994 budget already is drawing as much attention for what it won't in­clude as for what it will. Abor­tion restrictions, for instance, won't be there. Nor will pro­posals for health care financing or the president's new $1.6 bil­lion aid package for Russia. 
It also is the first budget in 12 years that isn't being declared "dead on arrival" by congressional leaders. 
In fact, the House and the Senate have already approved budget resolutions endorsing its broad outlines. 
But that doesn't mean there won't be fights. The budget Clinton sends Congress will de­tail thousands of specific spend­ing decisions to help him achieve his goal of close to $500 billion in deficit reduction over five years. 
And battles always come over details. They loom as con­gressional appropriations and tax-writing committees get down to the nitty gritty of spe­cific items. 
Republicans are. expected to pounce hard on many of the budget's proposals, as they have on Clinton's separate $16.3 billion fiscal 1993 stimulus package, now stalled in the Senate. 
Thursday's budget will put into details the many programs and proposals Clinton outlined in his economic address to a joint session of Congress on Feb. 17. 
Clinton's February 17 eco­nomic plan projected that the government in fiscal 1994 ­which begins Oct. 1 -would take in $1.25 trillion and spend $1.51 trillion, resulting in a $262 billion deficit. An adminis­tration official on Wednesday said there would be some changes from these in the fig­ures released on Thursday, but that they would be slight. 
Clinton's budget is expected to reflect his central campaign vows -cutting defense, cutting the deficit, and increasing "investment" 'spending on the nation's infrastructure (inc!uding highways and bridges). on education and on communications and other high-tech programs. 
The defense section -largely unveiled on March 27 by Defense Secretary Les Aspin ­calls for $263.4 billion in spending, $10 billion less than last year and $12 billion short of what former President Bush had envisioned. 
Defense savings in the slimmed-down budget come from a reduction of 108,000 in active duty military, a pay freeze and modest cuts in the Strategic Defense Initiative ­sometimes called "Star Wars." 
But the blueprint terminates no major Reagan-Bush era weapons systems. Aspin has called it a "treading water" budget. 
Clinton's proposal for addi­tional "infrastructure" spending is expected to be seen the most clearly in the Transportation Department budget-a 10.9 percent increase over this year. 
Total outlays would be $40.3 billion, including $28.4 billion on highways, bus transit systems, railroads, airports and maritime development. 
The Labor Department budget includes new spending for job training and assistance -key Clinton campaign promises. The president is proposing $4.1 billion over four years for such programs. 
The biggest single item: $2 billion to retrain dislocated workers who lose their jobs be­cause of military cuts, plant closings or the free-trade pact with Mexico 
The administration is also calling for $2.4 billion for job­less benefits for laid-off workers who have exhausted their state­administered benefits.

kitchen, there were Hot 
Grits A-Flyin' Coming 
From Behind me. -------­
Covered with breakfast, I was searching The Good, The Bad, and The Laundry for clean Shirts when my Plaid Pants started to get uncomfortable Below The Belt. I realized I had Severe Chafing Ill (There Is No Cure) because my Tighty Whities II (This Time It's Personal) were Pale Riders. 
An hour later. I was finally ready for work. "Blow Me (A Kiss)," my wife shouted as I hurried out the door. I saw Neal, Bob, and 3 Other Guys Who Work At The Hammer Plant Thundering Hard toward The Beer Train. Being The Old and Injured guy that I am, however. Movement Is Painful for me, and I had to go in Slow Motion. Soon I realized that I had Not A Chance In Hell to make it. The Steins drove me to catch the L-Train, and I finally made it to work at Eleven. 
The Boss was so ticked, his Smoldering Wig almost went up in flames. "In the boardroom," he shouted. "You, Me, Him, The Other Guy, and His Friend!" He tortured us with a long, boring lecture. "We simply have Too Few Good Men around here! We're riddled with Lack 0' Skill, and all I see when I walk through the office is Wasted Potential. Ladies and gentlemen, We're Just Not That Good!" My mind started to drift. "Nap Time," I said to myself, and drifted off to dreams of lunch. The boss woke me up again with his emphatic conclusion: "If we don't Put Up Or Shut Up, We Don't Stand A Ghost of A Chance in the corporate world, but if we do, we'll be As Good As We WannaBe!" 
Starving, I hustled to the cafeteria to see my co-workers feasting on all sorts of culinary delights: Yankee Pot Roast, Baked Potatoes, Pork: The Other White Meat, Baked Pollack Jarolinaire, and for dessert, Sexual Chocolate. I anxiously opened up my bag, but my heart sank. All I saw was Three 1\vinkies And A Pair Of Ding-Dongs. Obviously, my son was a Repeat Offender -he had exchanged our lunches again. I was forced to borrow Five Ones and buy some No Lard Burritos from the vending machine. 
Dreading the ride home on The Soul Train, I gladly accepted when Ugly Kid Joe offered to drive me. We were driving along behind a Busload to Palookaville when we witnessed a Drive By Shooting. The Bus Drivers' swerving reaction made us Crash and Burn. We felt No Pain, but had to hop out of the car into the pouring Acid Reign. Having No Clue what to do With Ourselves, Joe and I hurried into Ramona's Car Wash to take shelter. There, some Women On The Rebound picked us up. At long last, I arrived home, exhausted. 
I Ain't Sayin' how happy I was to walk in the door and see my wife stretched out in the hot tub. She winked, laid a Kiss of Finesse on me. and whispered, "Climb On In, Slim."

Macedonia's UN membership approved 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) ­Macedonia was approved for 
U.N. admission by the Security Council on Wednesday after months of haggling with Greece over the symbolism of the former Yugoslav republic's name and flag. 
One argument between Greece and Macedonia has roots going back 2,400 years: who has the right to claim Alexander the Great's emblem as its national heritage. 
Greece also claims the name Macedonia is part of its heritage and implies territorial designs on the northern Greek province of the same name. 
Under a compromise worked out with Greece, the new country was admitted with the cumbersome provisional name "The Former Yugoslav Province of Macedonia." Negotiators will choose a new name later. 
To avoid offending Greece during the meeting, the Security Council resorted to elaborate word play. 
Its resolution did not mention Macedonia by name, referring to it only as "the state whose application is contained in doc­ument s/25147," and "the state concerned." 
The council president, Ambassador Jamsheed Marker of Pakistan, did utter the "M­word" in a brief statement explaining that the name "The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia" did not imply an ongoing connection to Yugoslavia or the right to use the name "Macedonia." 
The unanimous vote by the 15 council members sends the application to the General Assembly, where it must be approved by two-thirds of its 170 members. Passage is expected when the assembly meets Thursday. 
Some delicate issues remain, however. 
Jackson says he's not interested in NAACP post
U.N. officials don't know where Macedonia would be seated in the General Assembly's alphabetical seating plan -among the Ms. or with the Ys next to Yugoslavia, or under F for "Former Yugoslav Province." 
Under the agreement between Greece and Macedonia, an arbitration committee will decide the new name and other disputes within two months. 
In Athens, Greek Foreign Minister Michalis Papacon­stantinou said: "I consider this a satisfactory development, and from now on negotiations will begin which, I never hid, will be difficult." 
The latest delay to U.N. admission was Macedonia's adoption last year of a flag that included the 16-rayed Star of Vergina, symbol of the Macedonian dynasty of the 4th century B.C. Greek warrior-king Alexander the Great.

The Structures and Processes subcommittee examined the manner in which the students. faculty, and administration in­teract through various bodies. It also addressed the nature of literature mailed to Notre Dame constituencies. Above all, the subcommittee stressed the need for an improvement of coordination between various campus groups. 
The information gathered by these groups will be used to support the final recommenda­tions of the Colloquy, which will be presented next month to the University's board of trustees. "The intention is not to include this material, other than the mission statement, in the final document." said Malloy. 

Budget 
continued frompage 1 

Clinton's $590 billion budget for the Department of Health and Human Services -the agency that spends the most ­is expected to boost spending for children, women's health and AIDS research, care and prevention. 
But nothing will be set aside for either universal health care or proposed welfare reform, officials said. Clinton's health care proposal is not due out until late May -at which time he will propose both a system for providing health care for all Americans and a way of paying for it. 
"You can't have a budget for something there is no package for," said Campbell Gardett, an HHS spokesman. 
Also to be gone from this year's health budget: abortion restrictions that had been perennials for both Reagan and Bush. 
Clinton plans to scrap the Hyde amendment (named after Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill) banning federal payments for poor women's abortions and to ditch the prohibition on covering abortions in health plans of federal workers. 
On the foreign aid front, Clin­ton is expected to propose an increase of $700 million in aid to Russia. 
But none of the $1.6 billion package of new aid he an­nounced at last weekend's summit in western Canada with Russian President Boris Yeltsin will be in the budget. Clinton has said those funds will all come from various earlier congressional appropriations. 
Israel and Egypt will continue to be the single biggest recipients of U.S. foreign aid ­$3 billion for Israel and $2.2 billion for Egypt, same as this year. 
Some other expected details of Thursday's budget: 
-The $30 billion Space Sta­tion Freedom will be fully funded at $2.1 to $2.3 billion, although officials are looking for ways to cut the overall price tag by about half. 
-Scarce federal dollars will likely keep to a minimum the number of new education pro­grams Clinton will propose. But the budget is expected to. con­tain money for a modest pilot program of his National Service Trust program -in which stu­dents could repay college loans through public service. 
-Much of a proposed $1.2 billion increase in the budget of the Veterans Affairs Depart­ment would go to improving VA hospitals and medial care.

"Even if my  number  one  

ranking is upheld by the full board of directors, it would not be in the best interest of the NAACP membership for me to continue to permit my name to be considered," Jackson wrote. 
Jackson said he ''had a chance to reflect" on a pro­posed rule change that would broaden the board's powers over day-to-day functions of the National Association for the Ad· vancement of Colored People. 
"The idea . . . is a substantial shift from the current constitu­tion," Jackson said. "A strong director -with meaningful powers and duties-is essen· tial to a strong NAACP. 
"I felt, then and now, that on the matter of constitutional changes, I would err on the side of conservatism because constitutional changes have such long-lasting effects," he said. "Although I have with­drawn my name from consid­eration; l have not withdrawn my love, my respect and my hope for the NAACP's survival and progress." 
The NAACP, the nation's oldest civil rights organization, has half a million members. 
Jackson indicated that he would not attend the Friday meeting in Atlanta. An or­dained Baptist minister, Jack· son said the meeting conflicted with the Easter holiday. 
His withdrawal came amid rumors in NAACP circles that many chapters -as well as some black Americans who look to the NAACP for leader­ship -objected to Jackson's candidacy. ­
His supporters argued that Jackson's national visibility would be good for the organiza­tion. Opponents argued that the NAACP needs new blood among its leadership. 
Howard University political scientist Ron Walters, an ad­viser to Jackson's 1988 presi­dential campaign, said Jack­son's departure "really says more about the NAACP than it does about Rev. Jackson." 
"Anyone would have to con­sider whether they would run an organization as big as the NAACP under those condi­tions," Walters said. "It's sad. Not sad for Jackson, but for all the rest of us." 
Speculation about a Jackson pullout intensified last month after a search committee failed to narrow the field of four can­didates despite heavy lobbying by Jackson supporters. 
The other candidates for the job are the Rev. Benjamin Chavis. 45, head of the United Church of Christ's Commission For Racial Justice; Jewell Jack­son McCabe, 4 7, founder of the National Coalition of 100 Black Women; and Earl Shinhoster, 42, NAACP Southeastern re­gional director. 
Shinhoster said Jackson's departure does not detract from the pool of candidates. 
"Whether persons stay in the race or leave the race is not the issue," he said. ''It's important to me that the NAACP draws people of note. I simply am the best person for the position."

Cuomo withdraws from Supreme Court picture 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Mario Cuomo, the best-known candidate for the upcoming Supreme Court vacancy, for­mally withdrew Wednesday from consideration before President Clinton had narrowed his list of prospects. 
In a letter to Clinton, Cuomo said wanted to remain as gov­ernor to help New York's economic recovery. He said staying in the political world would allow him to "continue to serve as a vigorous supporter of the good work you are doing for America and the world." 
The letter was sent to confirm an earlier telephone con­versation with Clinton, but it does not say when the tele­phone call was made. 
Clinton refused earlier in the day to confirm reports of the withdrawal, but said, "I think

he's terrific." 
Cuomo's decision removes the only candidate with celebrity quality from the long list of names earning speculation in Washington. It would appear to be an indication that Cuomo may run for a fourth term as governor. 
Aides said Clinton is at least a month away from making his choice. There is no hurry, since White will not retire until the end of the court's term, usually late June or July. 
Cuomo's decision, which Newsday said was forwarded to Clinton last Thursday, was unknown to some of Clinton's closest advisers until now. That is an indication of how hard the president is working to avoid leaks that plagued some of his Cabinet selections. 
Among the candidates being mentioned by administration officials are Judge Judith Kaye, chief judge of New York's highest state court; Judge Patricia Wald, who sits on the 
U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington; and Judge Richard Arnold of Little Rock, who sits on the Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Arnold is an old friend of Clinton. 
Clinton has by no means limited his choices to those three people, White House of­ficials say. 
In the rampant speculation about the Sup-reme Court opening, Cuomo had emerged as the liberal wing's sentimental choice, though the Clinton inner circle had never tipped its hand about Cuomo's chances. 
But the loss of a celebrity candidate in Cuomo could rob 
Government asks for dismissal of charges 
WASHINGTON {AP) -The Justice Department moved Wednesday to drop federal charges against Washington powerbroker Clark M. Clifford and law partner Robert A. Alt­man in connection with the scandal-plagued international bank,BCCI. 
However, the government asked for a dismissal without prejudice, meaning it could bring the charges again. In addition, through agreement with Clifford and Altman, the government reserved the right to bring new, broader charges in the future through a criminal information that, unlike an in­dictment, does not require a grand jury. 
The prosecutors sought the action in a motion to U.S. Dis­trict Judge Joyce Hens Green, who had scheduled the federal trial to start June 1, both be­cause of Clifford's heart prob­lems and because of Altman's current prosecution on state charges in New York. -''The present status of Mr.

Clinton of one of the qualities he is seeking in a nominee. Another White House official familiar with the search process said Clinton wanted "someone who will make people say 'Wow,' whether they agree with the person or not." 
Clinton has said only that he wants a justice who will respect the right to privacy, an argument that is the under­pinning for a woman's right to an abortion. Clinton said he would not directly ask any potential nominee his or her position on abortion. 
White House officials said Clinton may be trying to make history with his first choice to the Supreme Court. That could help the chances of Amalya Kearse, a New York federal judge who is black. 
She believes in abortion 

Clifford's health is such that it is nearly certain that he will not be available for trial on June 1, let alone available in advance to assist his attorneys in prepara­tion for trial," the motion said. 
Clifford, 86, underwent open­heart surgery on March 22. He has agreed, the motion said, to undergo a physical examination by a court-approved physician at any time within six months of the dismissal of the charges to determine his fitness to stand trial. 
The government also disclosed for the first time that the FBI had tapped Clifford's phone "over a dozen years ago," but said none of the three electronic interceptions "relate in any way whatsoever to any aspect of this case." 
Clifford's and Altman's at­torneys had pressed for the disclosures after prosecutors in the New York trial said they "had reason to believe" there had been electronic intercep­tions of conversations among some of the witnesses they

rights, but is considered a moderate-to-conservative. Sen. Arlen Spector, R-Penn., has already said her confirmation would be easy. 
Jose Cabranes, a federal judge from New Haven, Conn., is another named that is being bandied about. He could be the first Hispanic on the court. 
A drawback to both Kearse and Cabranes is their lack of public experience, a quality that Clinton is known to value. 
White House aides said Clinton's decision is at least a month away because Clinton is taking his time. It also might help him politically to make the nomination as late as possible to stave off campaigns against the candidate, although officials said that is not entering Clinton's thinking. 
planned to call. Mark Dubester, an assistant 
U.S. attorney, also said in an affidavit there were two FBI electronic interceptions involv­ing a Robert Altman more than a decade ago, but added he be­lieves that Altman is a different person from the defendant. 
Carl Rauh, an attorney for Clifford and Altman, said he had no idea what the FBI wiretaps of Clifford might show. 
''I'm not sure that it's relevant anymore," Rauh said. "We're just enjoying the fact that the case has been dismissed. We think the Justice Department did the right thing here." 
A federal grand jury indicted Clifford, a former Defense sec­retary and adviser to several presidents, and Altman last July 29 on charges of conspiring to defraud the Federal Reserve Board by concealing the role of the foreign-owned Bank of Credit and Commerce Inter­national in acquiring U.S. banks. 
Correction 

In a page one headline yesterday, The Observer ran a headline which inaccu­rately claimed that permis­sion has been granted to establish a women's re­source center at Notre Dame. Rather, the Office of Student Affairs gave per­mission to the Women's Re­source Committee to dis­tribute needs assessment forms to students. The establishment of a the center is still pending permission. The Observer regrets the error.

Clinton moves ahead in Congress 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Be­

tween the Democratic-con­
trolled 103rd Congress and 
President Clinton, it has been 
more lockstep than gridlock. 
Despite a setback on his still­lingering jobs bill, Clinton in 75 days won approval for his eco­nomic blueprint, reordering economic priorities and envi-· sioning higher taxes, defense cuts and selected domestic spending increases. He and the lawmakers worked together to pass the family leave bill that Democrats had been seeking for years. 
In addition, Congress sup­ported Clinton in his plan to lift the bans on abortion counseling at federally funded clinics and on using Medicaid funds for the abortions of poor women, sharp reversals of 12 year of Reagan­Bush policies. 
They brought the Motor Voter Registration Act back for another go-round and cooper­ated in laying the groundwork for a national health reform plan. 
"I think we've made re­markable progress in a short period of time," said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, reflecting the key fac­tor: for the first time since Jimmy Carter was in the White House, one party has controlled both houses of Congress and the executive branch. 
"I would say from Clinton's perspective, it has been suc­cessful so far," acknowledged Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who wrote the law banning use of Medicaid funds for abortions. "He has been able to encourage his troops to rally around the flag, and they have done so with only minor dissent." 

At the same time, Republicans bristle over what they feel is Clinton's failure to consult them often enough. 
"The only call I got was from the president of the American Red Cross," deadpanned Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole, referring to his wife, Elizabeth Dole. "I told her I didn't want to give blood." 
The jobs bill setback may have been a reflection of the GOP's determination to keep from being steamrollered by the Clinton juggernaut. 
Clinton pledged Tuesday to continue his fight for the bill, and the White House and Democratic leaders said they were ready to compromise after three unsuccessful efforts to crack a Republican filibuster. 
"We will see when Congress comes back whether the Re­publicans are committed to putting America back to work or just playing politics," the president said. 
The jobs bill aside, Clinton has shown a willingness to walk away from other fights when the odds were against his prevailing. When both the House and Senate voted ­against Clinton's wishes -to block immigration by people affected with the AIDS virus, the White House put up scarcely a fuss. "The president has to work with Congress. He can't act unilaterally on issues like this," said Dee Dee Myers, White House press secretary. 
The Democrats. who have majorities in both chambers, have stuck with Clinton despite his relatively weak public honeymoon period. Clinton's poll ratings are lower at this point than those of his Republi­can predecessors. 
Key parts of his program are politically unpopular, too, espe­cially his tax increases on en­ergy and Social Security. 
But Clinton has proved to be a skillful lobbyist, eager to jump into the fray or just show up on Capitol Hill for a meal. 
On St. Patrick's day, the House canceled its votes while Clinton was there for lunch. Members joked that they were afraid if they left the room, Clinton would snitch their corned beef. 
But there were mistakes, too, some of which could continue to haunt the new administration. 
Los Angeles edgy as King verdict nears 
LOS ANGELES (AP) Armored personnel carriers have moved in. Police are packing rubber bullets and tear gas. Korean-American merchants have stocked up on guns. Even churches are ready, making plans to stay open as long as necessary and patrol their neighborhoods. 
The city is nervous as the second Rodney King beating trial draws to a close, but determined to avoid a repeat of the devastating riots that followed acquittals in the first trial last spring. 
Los Angeles isn't the only worried city. San Francisco was among other cities hit by rioting last year, and at least one store there already has begun boarding up its windows at night. 
Jury deliberations in the federal trial are expected to begin on Good Friday and could continue through Easter. Almost every resident, from merchant to mayor, prays violence will be avoided. 
Police Chief Willie Williams and Mayor Tom Bradley promised this week to send 6,500 uniformed officers into the streets as soon as delibera­tions begin. Those officers will carry special riot-control gear and a serious attitude. 
"We're not going to fail you this time," Williams told Los Angeles. 
His predecessor, Daryl F. Gates, was accused of not caring and not acting quickly enough last spring when the state jury acquitted four white officers of most charges in the March 3, 1991, beating of the black motorist. 
What followed were three days of wanton lawlessness in which 54 people died and 10,000 businesses were destroyed. Damage estimates reached $1 billion. 
"People cannot afford to lose anymore or have any more damage done to their communities," said Tony Salazar, co-chair of Rebuild L.A., a private group of business and community leaders formed after the riots. 
"People in Los Angeles are generally tired of it and want to put the riots behind them." 
Easier said than done. The federal trial isn't the end of it. On Wednesday, a trial was

postponed until July for three black defendants charged with attacking white trucker Reginald Denny at the start of the riots. 
Meanwhile, Los Angeles waits. 
Police officers carry rubber bullets and tear gas. The National Guard has moved in armored personnel carriers. Churches throughout South Central. site of last spring's worst devastation, will open as soon as the verdicts are read and remain open as long as they are needed. 
The First AME Church held a meeting Wednesday night to review church leaders' strategies for patrolling their neighborhoods, staffing a rumor-control station and caring for their youngsters. 
"We need to have a voice of reason," church spokesman Mark Whitlock said. "We need to have a calm, analytic response."

Clinton proposes cut in purchases of park land 
WASHINGTON (AP) -After promi.S.In.g during his campaign to buy tpore park and recreation lands, President Clinton is proposing funding substantially below what Ge· orge Bush spent for that pur­pose. an administration official confirmed Wednesday. 
To the diSmay of conservation groups, Clinton is proposing $209 million for public land acquisition in his fiscal 1994 budget to be released Thursday, considerably less than the $366 mUlionBush sought last year. the· official said, speaking only on condition he not be named. 
The Clinton administration has decided to focus on upkeep and repair of lands the government already owns in­stead of buying new property, officials said. 
"'There is a budget reality that is clear. There is not a Jot of money to go around," said Kevin Sweeney, spokesman for Interio.r Secretary Bruce Babbitt. Sweeney refused to confirm the budget figures that wUl be released Thursday, but noted Babbitt has madeit a clear priority "to make sure that the parks we have are in very good shape." 
·"The commitment is there to restOre the parks," he said. The National Park Service faces a $4 billio.n backlog of serious maintenance problems. some of which were targeted with a $250 million allocation in Clinton's economic stimulus package that is stalled in Congress. 
The Park Service is slated for a 19 percent operating increase in the 1994 budget, and an overall budget increase of $300 million,. to $1.5 billion, according to the official who spoke anonymously. 
But environmentalists and their congressional allies contend the government also should fully utilize a fund specifically designated for public land acquiSition. 
Environmentalists already were upset with Clinton for dropping his insistence that Congress use the budget pro­cess to levy royalties on miners vvho use western lands and raise grazing fees, a shift that 
the administration counters 
was one of tactics not policy. 
They greeted the latest news 
glumly. 
"That is an absolute disaster. It breaks a campaign promise," said Ralph DeGennaro, a budget analyst for Friends of the Earth. 
"If this is true, we would be disappointed because we had hoped from the position that the president had taken during the campaign that we would be doing much better," said Don Hellman, a Wilderness Society attorney. 
Clinton had promised in his campaign book "Putting People First" to "expand ocir· efforts to acquire new parklands and recreational sites with funds already available under the federal I.and and Water Conservation Fund." 
That fund was established by Congress in 1965, mostly from royalties paid to the gov­ernment for offshore oil and gas drilling. Congress desig­nated the fund for purchase of federal recreation lands and to give states matching grants for their own park projects. 
Historically, Congress has appropriated less than the $900 million available to the fund annually, leaving a surplus of more than $9 billion on paper. 
For the last decade. Congress has generally increased the president's request, with appropriations averaging about $250 million a year. However, in the last two years of his presidency. Congress cut Bush's request -in 1993 to $283 million, from $366 million, and in 1992 to $317 million from $350 million he sought. 
President Reagan had re~ quested as little as $15 million in spending, but Congress brought the figure up for each year of hiS presidency. 
Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La. last week introduced legislation calling for dedication of $1 billion a year from the fund without having to go through congressional appropriation.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Cheerleading coach unqualified 

Dear Editor: 
Imagine for a moment the following scene: 
Interviewer: So you are ap­plying to coach an athletic pro­gram at Notre Dame. Have you ever coached this sport before? 
Applicant: No. 
Interviewer: Okay, have you ever participated in the sport before? 
Applicant: No, I haven't done that either. 
Now imagine learning that this applicant was granted the position. As ridiculous as this situation sounds, the University has recently made just such a hiring decision for its cheer­leading program. In bringing attention to this, we mean no disrespect or ill will toward the recently-hired cheerleading coach. 
We commend Ms. Clements for her professionalism and thank her for her genuine con­cern for the quality of the pro­gram. Nonetheless, we find the way in which the hiring was done to be unacceptable for a school of this caliber and a pro­gram of such high visibility. 
Although many do not con­sider cheerleading to be a sport, this belief does not justify cheating the cheerleaders from having a qualified coach. Music is not a sport, yet we doubt that the University would hire a band director or orchestra conductor with no musical background. Why, then, is cheerleading not given the same basic respect and consid­eration of its program needs? It would have been just as easy to hire a qualified coach, yet this simply was not done. 

The cheerleading coach must make many decisions which require knowledge of the sport. More importantly, the coach must ensure that all gymnas­tics, partner stunts, and pyra­mids are performed with proper technique and safety standards. An unknowledgeable coach not only makes it difficult for the squad to present its best possible appearance, but also places the safety of squad members in jeopardy. 
To members of the squad, one of the most important goals is to improve and build a quality program. We had hoped that the members of the athletic de­partment would share and support this goal. Instead, they disregarded it. Although the athletic department supports the cheerleaders financially and we are sure that they are grateful, a more appropriate form of support would be sim­ply acting in their best interest. 
We understand that cheer­leading is not the department's top priority, and we don't ex­pect it to be. Nonetheless, we do expect the department to treat its athletes fairly; this hiring decision is not only unfair but insulting to the program as a whole. From the moment we arrived at Notre Dame as freshmen, we have been told of the high standards of excellence that this University stands for. Why are these standards now being ignored?

Dear Editor: 
I am writing in response to the letter which appeared in Viewpoint on April 6 from William Partridge and William McDonald, two Notre Dame students who are currently in Innsbruck. I do not so much wish to defend the Viewpoint section of The Observer, which they accuse of "intellectual stagnation," as I wish to ques­tion the attitude with which their letter was written. 
Granted, the ongoing debates concerning meal plan options, Saint Mary's, and other such issues, are not of the utmost importance in the international, grand scheme of things. Campus issues are indeed of a lighter nature than European unification or France's radical right wing. 
Yet just because some issues are not mainstays in The Ob­server Viewpoint section, does it mean we here in South Bend are blind to current events. Surely these topics are dis­cussed in many classes and students are exposed to them through other newspapers and media sources. 
Furthermore, many of the debates which occur in View­point are critical te our lives 
here at Notre Dame. While the international world moves along, so too does. the Notre Dame world which we are all a part of. I resent being told to "Wake up!" when no waking is necessary. 
Mr. Partridge and Mr. Mc­Donald must think rather highly of themselves to refer to the students here as "boring people." They further insinuate we know nothing of a world where there is sex before mar­riage or young people exhibit­ing independence. I dare say that we here are not as igno­rant as that. We do not need Mr. Partridge and Mr. McDonald "to bring to light" the world outside of Notre Dame. 
Finally, the arrogant attitude which Mr. Partridge and Mr. McDonald seem to have ac­quired is not a goal of studying abroad. Spending a year over­seas should broaden your hori­zons, not enlarge your ego as well. As a student planning to spend next year in Angers, France, I only hope that I do not grow cynical and conde­scending towards the very Uni­versity which I owe so much to.

After one year, Dalloway's Coffehouse expanding, seeking larger audience by offering students a getaway 
Student record label releases new CD 
By ANNE DELANEY 
Accent Writer 
There are not many establishments that allow unlimited loitering without purchase in these United States, much less South Bend. Few are the places which are so versatile to act as venue, theater, lecture hall and dance floor. 
Yet coffeehouses are present on most campuses, acting as an integral part of college living. This opportunity is now easily accessible on Saint Mary's cam­pus. Clarissa Dalloway's Coffeehouse offers a wide variety of entertainment and atmosphere as well as good coffee. 
A coffeehouse is an excellent alternative to the more common but ever-exciting weekend activities here at Saint Mary's and Notre Dame according to students. 
"It can be an intellectual haven and is absolutely needed at a university," said Sorin Spohn, a Notre Dame sophomore. 
Originally a clubhouse in which dances and other events took place, the present coffeehouse changed last year. Peggy Abood, Saint Mary's '92, thought that the space had great potential as a coffeehouse. She learned that the space was open and worked with Patrick White, associate dean of faculty, to put her plan in motion. 
The coffeehouse was underwritten with donations from the Parents' Council, residence halls and classes as of January 1992 and now is a self-sufficient operation, according to Georgeanna Rosenbush, director of Saint Mary's Student Activities. 
With donations from last year's senior class, the college and the Parents' Council, Dalloway's was able to invest in new furniture and sound equipment. Students and staff members still have ideas for expansion. 
One of Dalloway's strongest features is that it provides the on-campus draw for Saint Mary's students, according to Saint Mary's freshman Melissa Krauss. 
"It's nice," she said. "It's a small setting. I wish Saint Mary's would do more things like this. There are an ijwful lot of people who leave on weekends because they aren't finding the social life

Dalloway's has attracted crowds to hear many campus bands who have played at the 
Coffeehouse. 

here. This is a good outlet." 
According to Saint Mary's students, Dalloway's is a social outlet for them, although it is open to Notre Dame students. However, most Notre Dame students admitted that they had never been to Dalloway's, and many said they had never heard of it. 
"I know a lot more people who go this year than last year," said Saint Mary's sophomore Holly Purnhage. "I don't think it's enough to bring everyone from Notre Dame over, but I think they've established regulars." 
Originally, Abood intended for the Dalloway's to be a center where any student could go any time of day. It would be run by students and open 24 hours. However, there are conflicting interests with Marriott, the college's dining service, because of the dining hall's extended hours planned for next year. Also, the Haggar Snack Bar is another center of conflict, according to Mary Beth Wilkinson, Saint Mary's student body president-elect. 
Wilkinson said she would like her proposal for a higher student activities fee, currently in review, to aid in the expansion of Dalloway's. 
"I'd like to have money go to the coffeehouse for interior and exterior improvements and possibly longer hours. Now there are thinly -spread finances for student workers, but there is strong support in this area. Also, I'd like to see the place open more so that students can just get away." 
Why volunteer at Dalloway's? Most students spend their extra time studying or working , both of which are rewarding activities. But a coffeehouse is a new alternative to joining a formal club or organization. People wanted to get this innovative idea started, so volunteers were easy to find. Word-of­mouth was a powerful tool in gathering enthusiastic help, according to Kelly Hartman, a Saint Mary's junior. 
"If you're just hanging out anyway, you may as well work and enjoy yourself at the same time," Hartman said. "I think it's the best thing that's happened to Saint Mary's in a long time, although I'd like to see more first-year students and sophomores involved. Anyone can volunteer at Dalloway's and is always welcome." 
Dalloway's has much to offer-it is a place where new bands can try out their stuff before (or after) hitting the bigger scene. It's where the Sister Chain, the only all-women's band on either campus, got its successful start. Neo-Woolfians can spout their verse, or friends can gather in conversation, high-minded or base, away from hectic dorms and academic responsibility, according to students. 
"It's the only place you congregate with your angst-counterparts and dissect the theories of Sartre and make fun of Spelunker without being ridiculed," said Saint Mary's senior Caroline Clarke. "It's better than sitting in your dorm single listening to Morrissey on low batteries." 
Dalloway's is one of the most versatile, opportunity-laden places around and offers everything from folk dancing to grunge. It is a place refreshingly atypical of other campus establishments, a welcoming medium in which people can get away with their excuses for not studying, and just get away. 
Manager Megan Grogan, a Saint Mary's senior who has undertaken the large responsibility Peggy Abood left behind, is excited about the coffeehouse and its expansion. 
"I'm glad that Saint Mary's has a place of its own, and it's encouraging that there is such overwhelming participation from both campuses," she said. It is not only an achievement that is personally rewarding to those who spearheaded it, but one that can be enjoyed by all, she added. 
Come to Clarissa Dalloway's and see how the coffeehouse tradition has continued, from the 17th century Near East to 20th century South Bend.

Shame on Colin Clary. 
A month until graduation, and he still hasn't written his resume. But then again, he hopes he'll never have to. 
Best known on campus as a guitarist­vocalist for Brian, Colin and Vince, Clary isn't looking for corporate job offers. He's taking an alternate route toward post-graduate happiness, by beginning Sudden Shame. 
The record label will make its second release next week: Brian, Colin and Vince's "Bucket o' Fun n' Stuff n' Yeah." 
Clary sees the 15-song CD as his document for the world. 
"This disc will be my resume in an application for a job with myself," he said. 
"Bucket o' Fun n' Stuff n' Yeah" features 15 Brian, Colin and Vince songs, and will likely sell well, based on the sizeable following that the band gained on campus over its two-year existence. 
But for now, Clary's checkbook ledger is a mass of red scribbles. Sudden Shame's budget, which three months ago resembled a shoestring, now looks like something less than spider's silk. 
"The label's deep in debt until we sell some discs," Clary said. Selling the Brian, Colin and Vince disc for $8, Clary is not trying to make quick money. But he thinks he just might be able to get out of the red. 
''I'm not trying to make any 


profit," Clary Sudden Shame said. "All I want on some sort of to do is maybe equal footing break even." with Merge, Ajax, K, and S u d d e n other great Shame's first independent release, "Snowi labels with Springs/Yam titles like Soap," featured "Norplant Clary along with Solution" and Chisel's Ted Leo guitars which and somehow seem Chris Norborg. like a cross The three mixed between up the vocal and Chisel's and instrumental Brian, Colin chores, recorded and Vince's fifteen songs on allow "Snowi

"Snowi 
Springs/Yam 
Soap" puts 

Springs/Yam Soap." 
Clary plans to use the same underground system to sell Sudden Shame's that those small companies use. The worldwide network of indie labels and fanzines gives people with a common passion for music a medium through which they may communicate with each other-through music. 
"When I get that box of tapes, or discs, it's amazing," Clary said. "Because soon, your music can be all over the country. There could be a tape or CD in Omaha. We don't have to be there for someone to enjoy our music." 
Clary spends heaps of time delineating Sudden Shame's path. His personal notebook is a mishmash of lyrics, ideas, and financial calculations. He tries to figure out how many discs Sudden Shame will need to sell in order to record another release. He doesn't work in accounting formulas or calculus. He does simple multiplication of dollars and cents. 
"Money's obviously not the motivating factor in starting the label," Clary said. "I'd just like to put out music that I like so that other people can hear it."

ing to many cancellations of late events. Nevertheless, the teams were excited about com­peting in their first outdoor meet and competed well against powerful running schools like Miami (OH), Georgetown, and Providence. 
"We had a lot of kids compete well against both Eastern Kentucky and North Carolina," said coach Joe Piane. 
The action will begin today for the Irish, as several of the distance events will be run, in­cluding the 3000, 5000, and 10,000 meter runs. The Irish will look to Sarah Riley, Stefanie Jensen, and Emily Husted for leadership. Husted took second in the 1500 meter run at Eastern Kentucky two weeks ago, while Riley and Jensen qualified for the NCAA Outdoor Championships, to be held in New Orleans, La., June 2-5, in

With six games in four days, everyone will likely get a chance to play except Greg Layson who is out indefinitely with an injury to his right foot. A different injury to the same foot kept him out most of last season. Also out temporarily is Irish pitcher Craig Allen who has his appendix removed over the 5000 meter run while com­peting at the Raleigh Relays. 
Freshman Erica Peterson will lead Notre Dame in the sprint­ing categories. Peterson won both the 400 meters and the 400 meter hurdles at Eastern Kentucky March 27, and was the sole Irish representative at the Texas Relays last weekend. Karen Harris and Susan Maher will compete in the field events. Harris took second in the shot­put at the Raleigh Relays, while Maher won the high jump at Eastern Kentucky. 
The meet will conclude on Saturday with several sched­uled relays, events in which the Irish are hoping to be success­ful. Notre Dame's main con­centration this weekend will rest in competing well as a team, along with trying to qual­ify individuals for the NCAA Championships in June. 
the weekend. 

Almost the entire rotation will see time on the mound over the Easter weekend. 
The schedule for the LaSalle games are as follows: Friday's game against starts at 7 p.m., Saturday's doubleheader starts at 5 p.m. and Sunday's game starts at 1 p.m. while Monday's doubleheader against Cleveland State starts at 1 p.m. with all games at Covaleski Stadium. 
Webber bouncing back 
LOS ANGELES (AP)-Shed no tears for Chris Webber. He's going to be just fine. Who says so? Chris Webber. 
"I'm still a little bit depressed, but I'm OK," Webber said Wednesday at the John R. Wooden Award ceremony. "It's still kind of hard to swallow. It's just .real hard. I sort of want to crawl under a rock. (But) Chris Webber, he can deal with it." 
Webber attended the ceremony at the Los Angeles Athletic Club less than 48 hours after committing one of the biggest mistakes in NCAA tournament history. His infamous timeout call with 11 sec­onds left Monday night cost Michigan a chance at the title. 
Although obviously still feeling the effects of his gaffe, he was pleasant and gracious as he patiently answered questions from reporters. 
In addition, the bald, clean-shaven All-American showed he hasn't lost his sense of humor. 
"I think I'll grow long hair and a beard and move out to the California desert and wait for the basketball season to begin," he said with a smile.

For almost the last month, the 21st-ranked Notre Dame women's t team has 
bee safely tuck away in th friendly '-'V''""'"~ of the Tennis Pavilion. While indoors, Holyn Lord the Irish have racked up seven consecutive victories and a wealth of confidence. 
That confidence will come in handy this weekend as they head south to take on two solid teams from the Athletic Coast Conference. On Friday, the Irish take on North Carolina and on Saturday they face 25th­ranked Wake Forest. 
"I don't see playing away as all that different from playing at home," said junior Lisa Tholen. "The only time it would be dif­ferent is if we have a large crowd at our games, which doesn't happen all that often. If anything, our wins at home have given us the sense that we know we can win away from home as well." 
Playing on the road will not be the only difference for the Irish this weekend. They will also be hitting the outdoor hardcourts for the first time since their loss at unranked South Florida. 
"We have been able to get 
outside when the weather has 
been nice," said junior Christy 
Faustmann. "That will be key 
for us. We play indoors so 
much and it's a whole new 
ballgame outside. You have to 
be more patient." 
"Outside you need to move a 
lot more," said Tholen. "Also, 
the matches will probably be 
longer than we're used to in­
doors." 
With the roadtrip and the 
playing conditions already 
against them, the Irish seem to 
be at a disadvantage already. 
Throw in the Tarheels and 
Demon Deacons as formidable 
opponents and the challenging 
weekend looks even tougher.

The Carolina squad also has top-10 representatives in the Intercollegiate Tennis Associa­tion's singles and doubles rankings. In singles, Tarheel Cindy Gurney is ranked 8th in the latest ITA release, while she pairs up with teammate Alisha Portney to form the third­ranked doubles squad. 
Wake Forest, who has been in and out of the ITA ratings all season, is currently tied at no. 25, and holds wins over then­22nd ranked Kentucky, as well as South Carolina. In singles, 27th ranked Terry Ann Zawacki comes off an upset of Duke's third-ranked Julie Exum. The Deacons also claim the 11th­ranked doubles team in Liz Barker and Evans.

Irish softball challenges DePaul 
By DOMINIC AMOROSA 
Sports Writer 

While most Notre Dame stu­dents will pack their bags for Easter weekend, the Notre Dame softball will travel to Chicago and face perennial Midwestern power DePaul in a Saturday doubleheader. 
~ 
N o t r e 

Dame has a Ronnie Alvarez 16-9 record, including five straight wins. On Tuesday, the Irish swept a doubleheader from Michigan State 5-1 and 3­0. "One of our big goals was to come out strong against the Big 10," said coach Liz Miller. "Dominating Michigan State was very important for us. I was pleased with our perfor­mance." In Tuesday's first game, junior Carrie Miller fought off a hamstring injury to pitch four innings and record her fourth win. She yielded only one un­earned run on five hits while striking out one. Senior co-cap­tain Staci Alford finished the game for her second save. "Our bats were a factor in the game," commented Coach Miller. "It was nice to see be­cause we needed it." The Irish banged out 11 hits with sophomore Andrea Keys leading the way. Keys had two singles, a double, and one RBI. Other key hitters included sophomore Sara Hayes and junior Christy Connoyer. Hayes had a single and a double along with two RBI's, while Connoyer had a single and a double. 
Hough

before about half of his current teammates were born. But all those years of experience didn't help chase away butterflies before taking the mound for the season's opener. 
In fact, Hough displayed the animated mirth of a Little Lea­guer throughout his six innings of work. After releasing a hanging knuckler. he'd rou­tinely snap his head back and raise his index finger, following the ball's flight. His tired old face seemed to plead to his fielders, and to the gods, to keep the ball within the spa­cious confines of Joe Robbie Stadium. 
It didn't take long for Hough to christen the brim of his new teal hat with perspiration. And after being away from the "Senior Circuit" for so many years, Hough anxiously wel­comed the challenge of welding a bat. He'll need to brush up on his technique, though; he went 0-for-2 with a strikeout against his counterpart Orel Hershiser. 
But the 42,233 fans in Mi­ami-most of whom appeared considerably older than he-certainly appreciated Hough's every effort. The careful spectator also appreciated the Hough's lively personality in the dugout: playfully instructing young infielder Brett Barberie on his unique pitch, facetiously begging for another inning from his manager (and his peer in' age) Renee Lacheman, and cautiously ascending the

"We were just being aggres­sive at the plate," said Keys. "We were intense the whole game." 
In Tuesday's second game, freshman Kara Brandenburg pitched a complete game shutout. She gave up only two hits while striking out four. She improved her record to 3-1 on the year. 
"Kara pitched a great game," exclaimed Coach Miller. "She had great pitch selection. She's gained confidence the past couple of games because of the tough situations she has had to endure." 
At the plate, the Irish scat­tered nine hits throughout their lineup. Seniors Lisa Miller and co-captain Ronnie Alvarez recorded RBI singles while ju­nior Liz Goetz walked with the bases loaded for the third run. 
"The key to our winning streak was the Indiana State game, because it brought back our confidence at the plate," realized Miller. "We need to continue to stay loose at the plate and keep our confidence high." 
Saturday's doubleheader against DePaul will be a re­match of the championship game of the Subway Classic last weekend, which the Irish won 1-0. The Blue Demons enter the contests with a 9-14 record, and are led by pitcher Suzanne Wiegner. Wiegner defeated the Irish 2-1 last Saturday in the first game of the Subway clas­sic. DePaul also boasts a tal­ented infielder in Missy Nowak. 
"DePaul has strong pitching and great hitting," explained coach Miller. "These will be tough games for us." 
"We need to let DePaul know 
clubhouse ramp to puff on a ci­garette. 
A few of the team's whipper­snappers also managed to quickly win the hearts of fans. A boy named Scott Pose sent a chill down their aging spines, racing to the 432 sign in center field to flag down an Offerman drive. He knocked in two runs, too. 
Left fielder Jeff Conine stole the show, going 4-for-4 and scoring two of the Marlins six runs. Pose and Conine-hus­tling, overachieving rookies-are fan-favorites in the making. 
But as the team's top go-to man, their stopper, their MVP, one man stands alone this sea­son. He's Bryan Harvey, a vet­eran reliever and rehab project on whom the Marlins will rely to preserve late-inning leads. 
But the Marlins will look to Hough to preserve something more frequently at issue-their sanity. Through the years, we're better than them," added Keys. "We need to be strong and play tough." 
For the Irish, their injury list remains loaded. Freshman pitcher Terri Kobata has a strained calf muscle, but her status remains uncertain. Ko­bata will find out Friday if she can play. 
Kobata earned MCC Player of the Week honors following her performance against Indiana and Western Michigan last week. She leads the conference in victories (5-2). ERA (.077) and strikeouts (54 for 8.34 a game). 
"Her award is a team honor," said coach Miller. "The key is getting her healthy and keeping her healthy. If she is strong enough physically, she can do the job." 
If Kobata can't go, the Irish will look for Brandenburg and Alford to handle the pitching duties. Notre Dame's other pitcher Carrie Miller, will test her strained hamstring tomor­row to determine her availabil­ity. 
At the plate, Keys, Hayes, and junior Stephanie Pinter will provide the scoring punch. Hayes is tied for first in the MCC in triples (2), fourth in home runs (2) and ninth in RBI's (14). 
"If we're patient at the plate, lay off the pitcher's rise, and play well defensively, we'll do fine," .commented Keys. 
"We need to play our best," concluded coach Miller. 
Following DePaul, the Irish will play three doubleheader games at home next week against Valparaiso, LaSalle, and Butler. 
Hough has gained a wisdom that looks beyond wins and losses, contract disputes and media onslaught. 
Floridians enjoyed their day basking in the glory of a 6-3 Opening Day win. They found new heroes, and an old goat (Dodgers' right fielder Dar-ryl Strawberry). But to endure the long and brutal season(s) ahead, they'll have to find the same sense of humor possessed by their old hero, Charlie Hough.

Baseball edges Purdue, faces six-game weekend 
By JENNY MARTEN Associate Sports Editor 
It was a battle of pitchers and Purdue's Todd Jensen was the first to weaken. He also weakened the most as the Notre Dame baseball team (11-8) put two runs on the board in the fifth on a Ryan Topham triple for a 2-1 
a 
victory over the Boilermakers (21-6) today in West Lafayette, In. The fifth inning was the only inning in ,, · which either team scored. Irish junior 
Tom Price pitched the complete game 
allowing only one run on three hits with 
W 
seven strikeouts while Jensen also went 
the distance giving up two runs and five 
hits while striking out 10. 
Tom Price Using his fastball and slider at any speed, any count and any location, Price was able to work around hitters and force them to chase pitches outside the strike zone. 
Price (3-1, 4.20) has struck out 19 and walked only four in his last 30 innings on the mound. The left­bander who has opponents hitting .194 against him baffled Jermaine Allensworth, Big Ten player of the week last week, who went 0 for 4 in the game with two strikeouts. 
"Last year, I pitched against Purdue both times and the first time he (Allensworth) was up he hit a home run against me," said Price. "I had a good idea of how I was going to pitch him away and make him go after them." 
Notre Dame started out the fifth with freshman Robbie Kent taking a free pass to first which senior Eric Danapilis followed with a single to set up the Topham hit. Topham, a freshman, smashed a two-out triple. to deep right center field to drive in the two runs. 
"Last night and earlier in the game. I was pulling up on the ball a bit. I worked on keeping myself in there," said Topham a high school outfielder who has recently been starting at first base after learning the position in spring . "I think it was more of an adjustment early in the spring. I feel comfortable out there now."

Unbeaten Lacrosse faces No. 9 Duke 

By KEVIN MCGUIRE 
Sports Writer 
This has been a year of firsts for the 12th-ranked Notre Dame lacrosse team (8-0). Earlier this year, the Irish defeated their first top 15 opponent and have now garnered their highest ranking ever at #12. 
The ObserverSean Farnan Senior midfielder Chip Lonsdale picks up a ground ball in the Irish's win over Hobart. Lonsdale's play at the faceoff position will be pivotal against the ninth-ranked Blue Devils on Friday night. 
Irish seniors shine in final home match 
Brakus and Adam Wager, 8-3, and senior Mark Schmidt and junior Todd Wilson stormed from behind to take Grady Burnett and John Costanzo, 8­
6. Michigan's Jeff Curtis and Greg Artz edged Allan Lopez and Chris Wojtalik 8-5 in three-doubles, as Wojtalik pulled a stomach muscle early in the match. The senior will take the next three matches off to recover. 
In addition to Forsyth's thrilling victory, Coleman and Schmidt notched impressive wins, as Coleman beat Costanzo 6-0, 4-6, 6-2, and Schmidt aced Wager, 6-3, 6-2. 
"Our seniors really stepped up again," noted Bayliss, "Schmidt was absolutely unflappable. He drove Wager crazy, and there's not many guys Wager can't hit off the court." 
"With all our friends coming out for our last match," said Schmidt, ''I'm just glad it ended up alright." 
Senior Ron Rosas disposed of Burnett, 6-4, 6-2, at four-singles, and Wilson capped an impressive comeback by beating Peter Pusztai 2­6, 6-2, 6-2. Freshman Mike Sprouse fell to Jeff Prestice, 6-3, 6-3 at six­singles. 
"Wilson showed a lot of poise today," remarked Bayliss, "This was a tough match because they're a talented team, and they can beat us. 
"They have three top-20 players from the juniors (Junior tennis

"Will wouldn't have won this match two years ago." 
True, maybe two years ago senior Will Forsyth would not have had the talent and the confidence to outlast Michigan's 74th-ranked Dan Brakus the way he did yesterday, but then again Forsyth was not the 15th­ranked player in the nation two years ago. 
Irish coach Bob Bayliss made this comment after Forsyth, in the last home match of his career, fought off a stubborn Brakus tot 
1. capture a 6-4, 2-6, Will Forsyth 7-5 victory and provide the highlight of the Irish's 6­1 win. 
"He's made a big jump," said Bayliss of Forsyth, "He's gone from a No. 4 player whose pretty good to one of the top players in the country." 
Like Forsyth, the four other Irish seniors have also made great strides during their four year careers, and it showed in the ease in which they
.. 
disposed of one of the Midwest's best teams. 
The Irish started the rout off by capturing the doubles point, as Forsyth and Coleman shrugged off 
The Irish now face an incredible opportunity that could jettison their program to the top of the college lacrosse world. They have the chance to become the first Irish team to ever beat a Top 1 0 foe when they faceoff Friday night against the #9 Duke Blue Devils (6­
3) in Durham, N.C. So it's #9 versus #12 as the Irish try to crack the Top 
10. But to hear Duke coach Mike Pressler talk you wouldn't believe the Blue Devils are the higher ranked 'team. "We haven't been at full strength all year, and right now we're very hobbled with 13 guys out, in­: eluding two who just went under the knife this week." I One of those who is lost to Duke for the season is co­captain defenseman Joe Proud. Fortunately for the Irish, Proud is the best defender the Blue Devils have, and his size will be sorely missed by them as they try to stop a red hot Irish offense. 
Once again, the Irish will turn to junior attackers 
Randy Colley and Robbie Snyder, along with freshman 
Kevin Mahoney, to try and penetrate a very large Blue 
Devil defense. "Duke is a very big, physical team that 
tries to physically intimidate you. But I think our guys 
are tough enough mentally to ignore the physical part 
and concentrate on what is at hand," said Irish coach 
Kevin Corrigan. 
Sophomore goalie Ryan Jewell will lead the Irish 
defensive effort, relying on the prowess of junior 
Garrett Reilly and sophomores Mike Iorio and Billy 
Gallagher to keep the Blue Devil offense silent. 
They will be facing a powerful Duke offense led by 
attackers Scott Harrison and Seth McCulloch, who 
share the lead for points for the Blue Devils. "Their 
attackers are the beneficiaries of all the offense that 
their middies create for them," noted Corrigan. 
But perhaps the key for the Irish will be to control the midfield aspect of the game. The Blue Devils possess a very talented group of middies led by Matt Oglesby, Ross Moscatelli, and Jim Mannino. This group is not only strong on the defensive side, but are capable of putting the ball in the net and feeding Blue Devil attackers. 
"Their middies look to make things happen in the settled game, but who also like to get out on the break and create a lot of transition opportunities," said

Hough a timeless leader for youthful Marlins squad 
The Florida Marlins opened the 1993 Major League Baseball season with all the pomp and pageantry of a Disney Production Monday afternoon. 
Then, the new club entertained fans with all the things which make the game so genuine and great-the history, the ritual, the young, the ageless, the hopes, the possibilities. 
Charlie Hough sent a knuckler. fluttering toward Los Angeles Dodgers' lead-off batter Jose Offerman to start the festivities. Not exactly the portrait o a modern-day athlete, "Old Knucksie" is greying on top, widening in the middle and thinning in the legs. At age 45, Hough is a dinosaur of the game. 
But in Florida-the land of Spring Training, rooki~ leagues, and the defunct "old-timers" league, the land of the mythical fountain of youth and the land where America's social security checks go to be spent-Hough's story as rejuvenated "ace" of a young expansion team seems even more appropriately a metaphor for the game than "The Field of Dreams." 
Hough began his pro career in 1966,
