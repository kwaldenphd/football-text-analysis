Option to faculty 

Collective bargaining still open 
by Theresa Stewart Staff Reporter 
"Collective bargaining is one of the many options open to the faculty," Prof. Edward Trubac, president of the local chapter of the American Ass?c~ati?n o~ Un~vers~ty Professors, said yesterday. "The real issue involves faculty .Participation m university governance," he emphasized. . . . . . . 
Responding to an article in the South Bend Tribune on collective bargammg, mterviewmg Prof. James Cushing, president of the Faculty Senate, Trubac reported that the local chapter of the AAUP will shortly have a newsletter out to the faculty "informing them of what has transpired at unionized colleges." Commenting on the national AAUP'~ i1_1terest in collective bargaining, Trubac stressed the local chapter's role as one of providmg more information about this option for faculty participation. 
Cushing, Assoc. Prof. of Physics, called collective bargaining j~st one of the J?OSSi~le means for the faculty to exert any influence on the decisions made m regard to Umversity priorities. "That doesn't mean it is necessarily right for Notre Dan:te," he added. 
Cushing stated the soon-to-be-released Faculty Senate Report will not urge any course of action but will provide information on the history of collective bargaining, the pros and cons ~nd summaries of recent contracts under theat bargaining. 
"Wnen we say collective bargaining, many people think of an industrial union. That doesn't have to be the model. The two sides discuss more than wages," Cushing observed. 
Trubac elaborated on the idea of collective bargaining. "It has nothing to do with salaries," he said, "but is more concerned with the role of the faculty member in university governance when under the labor contract." . . . . . . . 
Trubac asserted the faculty has three options m regard to participation m Umversity priorities: no input, limited input, as in the option Hesburgh suggested by adding faculty members to the Budget Review Committee, or finally, participation through the use of collective bargaining. . 
"I think most faculty 'would prefer the inside situation Hesburgh suggested in which they would share a part in the decision-making. 'Collective bargaining is one outsider against the other outsider," he reasoned. 
''We are striving for the option of effective participation and the AAUP intends to keep the faculty informed," Trubac said. "In the upcoming newsletter such things as the impact of collective bargaining on tenure, academics and governance in the schools under the labor contract will be discussed,.. he concluded. 


For only lasting improvements 

Hall Life Fund Allocations announced 
by Bob Radziewicz Staff Reporter 
Hall Life Fund Allocations were announced at last night's Hall Presidents' Council Meeting by its chairman. Bob Howl. The hall improvement funds are now available from Student Government to be picked up at each hall's convenience, according to the HPC chairman. 
Howl reminded the hall presidents that in deter­mining fund requests, the HPC Budget Committee, which consisted of Howl, Executive Coordinator Tom Prorter and presidents Paul Brun and Rich Morton, considered only lasting improvements which would benefit the entire hall; no money was given for hall parties, dinners or picnics. The committee also recommended that some requests be directly handled bv the maintenance department, Howl noted. 


·"We held ourselves to strict, pre-set guidelines in evaluating fund requests," Howl stated. "Also when a committee member's hall request was being con­sidered, that person was not included in the deter­mination of his hall's allotment." 
"The committee tried to honor the requests of each hall, but with a limited amount of funds ($8500), complete fulfillment of each request was impossible," the HPC chairman explained. "Approximately 40 per cent of the requests were completely honored and the others came very close." 
Howl maintained that the committee tried to keep all allocations "reasonably consistent among all halls." The average amount of money that was divided among the 21 halls from the Hall Life Fund was $420. The final allotments granted by the Budget Committee ranged from Lyons Hall's allocation of $550 to $265 given to both Sorin and St. Joe Hall. Furniture and recreational equipment were the two items most reQuested. 
Student Body President Pat McLaughlin addressed the HPC meeting concerning the voter registration drive last month and the upcoming local elections. With more than 2600 students registering to vote in Indiana, McLaughlin explained that the next step was to bring in the local candidates for state senatorial and congressional seats from this district. The Student Body President then announced that Student Govern­ment would be sponsoring the three local Republican candidates next Tuesday and their three Democratic opponents next Wednesday. 
"I hope that each hall sends a representative to these open forums, so that anyone who can't attend is able to find out what positions these men hold on issues like a lower drinking age, state educational benefits for college students and better police protection," McLaughlin told the HPC. 
McLaughlin also explained the compromise made on student basketball tickets last week. The option that was finally accepted increased the number of student seats to 5400, 400 more than last year. The original proposal, which reduced the number of student seats, could have been considered a precedent in the case of any further price hike. The accepted proposal is far less likely to provide that precedent, according to McLaughlin. 
The final results of the referendum survey were also a factor against a student boycott of tickets. McLaughlin felt that 85 per cent in favor of boycotting was needed to make its purpose effective. The tabulation showed that only 60 per cent favored boycott if prices were not reduced. 
In other business, Howl thanked all those involved in last weekend's United Way drive for "a truly great effort." 
"We are extremely pleased with the student response, both in working and in supporting the United Way drive this past Saturday," the ltPC chairman said. "The shamrock sales Saturday more than doubled last year's total sales drive. We ask the students' continued support of this worthwhile cause over the remaining two weekends of the drive," How. stated. 
The final business of the meeting was an an­nouncement by Howl that the free HALL-MARC system for protecting personal property will be un­derway this week in all the halls. Residents who wish to have their social security number engraved on personal items should check with their hall president for their HALL-MARC representative.

Creative intelligence meeting tonight 
by Maryfran Hayes Staff Reporter 
A course in the Science of Creative Intelligence (SCI) will be discussed at a meeting tonight at 
7:30 at 266 E. Navarre Street in South Bend. Carol Dixon, who has taught the course locally for three years will supervise the session. 
SCI is the fundamental studey of the nature and growth in man and the universe as a whole. Students take the course in SCI in order to increase their understanding of Transcendental Meditation (TM> and to strengthen their intellect. The course consists of thirty 2-hour sessions, each with a color-video tape presentation by Mahrisha Mahesh Yogi, founder of SCI. 
"Two aspects of SCI are un­derstanding and experience which together are necessary to produce full knowledge and spontaneous full development of Creative In­telligence," explained the local president of the Student In­ternational Medition Society, Rob Carsello. 
Carsello elaborated that the development of Creative In­telligence is spontaneous; for a person who practices, TM results are automatic. Within a few days, weeks, or months the person notices: 1) thinking becomes clear, concentration is better 2) health improves, a person who meditates feels physically better, they are not as tired at the end of the day, 3) inner stabilityis gained, the way to world peace is through individual peace and TM helps in the development of this peace and 
4) as a result of the inner stability and flexibility gained, social behavior is naturally improved. 
"Students who have taken this course have said that it was the most fascinating course they have taken," commented Carsello. 
The course will be offered two or three times a week this semester. Corsello does not know if Notre Dame will accept the course for credit this semester, but next semseter Notre Dame is offering the SCI course for three credit hours.

Huddle No.1 



LaFortune renovation priorities discussed 
by Mike Rizzo Staff Reporter 
LaFortune renovation has completed one of its first priorities with the relocation and refur­nishing of the third and fourth floor offices, noted Rr. Dave Schlaver, Director of Student Activities. The direction of continuing renovation depends on the reaction of the Board of Trustees to a report from the Lafortune renovation com­mittee at the end of the week,· Schlaver noted. 
The report ot the trustees will ask that there be a slight change of priorities in the order of work to be done, Schlaver said. The com­mittee will recommend that some of the original $250,000 allotted for renovation be diverted to the basement of LaFortune and that the remodeling of the Huddle wait until a later date.. 
The original priorities in the plan were for remodeling the Huddle refurbishing of the LaFortune lobby, and the relocation of the student government and publication offices on the second floor of the building. There were no plans for work in the basement Rathskellar or the coffee house ar·ea. 
"The Huddle is still the first 

Spoke at Stepan 
priority," stated Ron Blitch, one of the N.D. student architects responsible for drawing up the new plans. "But the work there would have to wait until next summer and we want at least to be able to show that something is being done.there". 
The concern with renovation of the basement area arose with increasing use of the facilities this year, according to Student Affairs Vice-President Br. Just Paczesny. "Our original worry when students came up with the idea was that the place wouldn't be used," stated Paczesny, "but now with Darby's Place and the Nazz it is clear that students will use the palce." 
"There won't be anything major done there," noted Schlaver, "but we just want to beef it up." 
Blitch stated that a kitchen and coke bar are already present in the coffee house area and a type of food sales, with pizza and soft drinks, may be incorporated. 
Presently the work at LaFortune 
awaits the arrival of welded 
metal stair wells which will extend 
the present stariway up to the 
fourth floor. They are scheduled to 
arrive by the end of the week and it 
appears that the work will befin 
next week, observed Schlaver. 
Money for repairs to the roof and 
an increased power supply for the the building was also to come our of the $250,000. ''The roof work has already been done," stated Schlaver, "for a higher price ithan the estimate. The new trans­

former has been ordered but· hasn't arrived yet." 
Although the money is allocated, 
part of the slow down has been 
caused by a lack of creative input. 
"I kno\·: I don't have enough time 
to spend on it and neither does Fr. 
Wilson," Schlaver said. "Last year 
the stuaent group was more con­
cerned with other renovation and 
we just didn't get the input from 
them." 

The two student architects 
leading the renovation committee, 
Ron Blitch and Roxanne Jabbra, 
spent last year in Rome. Last 
week Blitch submitted the first 
sketches for a possible funiture 
arrangemnt of the first floor 
lounge. Since these are only the 
first alternatives for the 
refunishing , Schlaver cautioned 
that they must be studied carefully 
along with other possibliities. 
Presently the Huddle renovation 
is being delayed because there is 
no clear idea of the direction and 
extent of any remodelization. 
Original plans called for a phusical 
extension of the Huddle eating 
area, perhaps in a terrace over the 
pool room. However, a change like 
this, noted Sc.hlaver, entails 
revamping the entire Huddle 
operation. Paczesny noted, "When 
you start expanding the Huddle 
that means new dishwashers and 
stoves and the price goes up." 
The LaFortune renovation committee had planned to consult with experts from other eating establishments like MacDonal~s's and the Boar's Head to get opinions on the best utilization of funds for the Huddle work. As of yet nothing has been done intire that direction. 
Both Paczesny and Schlaver expressed the hope that the second floor lounge and the third floor ball room area refurnishing would be completed by the second semester and oossihlv over Christmas 
break. It is tentatively planned that the rooms will be repainted, the second floor furniture moved upstairs, and new furnishings obtained for the lounge. The painting has already been con­tracted out. The completed renovations and the inflation rate hamper further 
LaFortune renovation, Schlaver noted. The work done to date has exceeded previous estimates and the group is assuming that the lounge work and renovation of the Huddle would also be more. 
"Almost half of the original amount was to go for Huddle renovation," stated Schlaver. "Now that amount would probably not be enough for the work." 
The construction of a dark room was also to come from the quarter million dollar allotment, but the work at present awaits agreement among the student publications upon the feasible facilities required. The money for this work, added Schlaver, will probably come 'OUt of other operating w expenses. 
The major problem at present noted Schlaver is the lack of concrete plans and direction for the work and the wait for committee approval. Meanwhile, the prices have gone up with in­nation while the allotment remains the same. 


Rhodes calls report false 
by Greg Bangs Staff Reporter 
Charging that the Warren Commission Report on the assasination of President John F. Kennedy isinaccurate RustyRhodes asked a large crowd in Stepan Center last night to sign petitions for the release of that report by the National Archives. 
Rhodes is the Executive Director of the Committee to investigate Political Organizations. He travels throughout the country to acquaint students with political assasinations. The primary topic of his lectures is the 1963 assasination President Kennedy. 
Rhodes told the crowd of over 2000 people that the Warren report "had six sub-committees that 
dealt with a number of topics--­except the one that asked 'Who killed President Kennedy?' 
The Warren Commission 'determined' three facts, the first was the Lee Harvey Oswald was the assasin of John F. Kennedy. The second was that a total of three shots were fired at the President and the third stated that there was no conspiracy involved in the killing" explainec Rhodes. · 
Rhodes said he was "not con­
vinced of the validity of any of the 
conclusions." "When Earl Warren 
turned in the report to Lyndon 
Johnson, he said 'Perhaps we will 
never know the truth about the 
assasination.' Warren even ad­
vised the FBI to continue their 
investigations into the case. Earl 
Warren was not the only person 
unconvinced by the Warren 
report," Rhosdes said.

The Warren report said Oswald fired three shots from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Observatory within the time of 5.6 seconds. "Members of the U. S. Olympic team could not duplicate this speed" Rhodes pointed out. 
"The  Warren  Commission  ad­ 
mitted  that  under  normal  cir­ 
cumstances,  these  times  are  

highly unlikely, but the com­mission said that this was not a normal circumstance: this man was firing at the President of the United States." 
Rhodes said there is reason to believe Oswald never fired the acknowledged "murder weapon." "Prints were never found on the gun that Oswald supposedly shot Kennedy with." 
Parafin tests on Oswald also turned out to be negative. Rhodes explained that parafin tests determine whether a person has fired a gun. "Since the parafin tests on Oswald were negative, this would be reason enough to throw the case against him out of court." he said. 
Rhodes made use of the Abraham Zepruder film tho show that Oswald's firing the fatal shot was "highly unlikely." "The Warren Commission contends Oswald fired the shot that killed Kennedy. If this is so, Kennedy's head would have had to jerk for­ward, for Oswald was shooting at Kennedy from behind. But the 

Zepruder  film  clearly  shows  
Kennedy's  head  being  jerked  
backwards  at  the  time  Oswald  

supposedly shot him. It is im­possible for Oswald to have fired the death blow." Rhodes ex­plained. 
This is Rhodes second visit at Notre Dame in as many semesters. 
The former investigator and Santa Monica College Professor attracted over 4000 neoole to his lectures last February. His lectures employ the use of diagrams, slides, recordings and movis. Included among the films is the previously mentioned Zepruder work. "That film is stillillegal," Rhodes informed his audience last night," but I'm using it as evidence, so we're all breaking the law together."

SMC HUlllan Relations Council to hold HalloW'een auction 
by Keran Hinks Staff Reporter 

The month of October usually marks the beginning of Autumn. Associated with this time of the year are such activities as apple picking, leaf raking, pumpkin carving and, of course, Halloween. 
In lieu of the usual trick-{)r­treating and prank-playing that are so often connected with the season, the SMC Human Relations Council will be sponsoring a United Way Fund Drive Auction and Halloween costume party on Tuesday, October 22, from 4:30 until 7:30p.m. in the SMC Dining Hall. 
Judy Mardoian, Student United Way chairman is very optimistic and feels that this year's auction and costume party will prove to be more exciting and successful than in the years before. 
Downtown merchants and SMC faculty are making donations towards the auction enabling students to get quality mer­chandise at a relatively low cost. Handmade articles and novelty items, are just a few of the items to be auctioned off. 
The auctioneer for the evening will be Dr. Mark Bambenek, SMC's number one faculty con­artist, and should prove to make the event just that much more 
interesting  and  humorous  for  
everyone involved.  
All  proceeds  made  from  the  

auction will go to the United Way, which supports all of the service organizations in the community. The auction's goal has been set at $1,000. 
SAGA will be serving a special dinner in honor of Halloween with treats for everyone participating. 
Along with the auction and dinner will be a costume party. Large groups are strongly en­couraged to participate in the costume contest. Cash prizes will be awarded to the most out-

standing groups. 

Notre Dame will be receiving co­ex tickets and are also urged to actively participate not only in the aucion, but in the costume party as well. Arrangements are being made at this time enabling ND men to take part without having meals and being charged. 
Student support is greatly needed for the Fund Drive and in return they will not only be helping a worthy organization but will also profit from their generosity. Now is the time to start saving those pennies, guaranteed to come in handy. 
inform laymen and politicians what the ERA really is. "ERA isn't having co-ed bathrooms and the like," commented Martucci. "Hopefully the forum will educate and explicate .items of the act." 
Martucci continued, "Indiana is not as informed as we would like. It has a tough legislature and it would be good if we can get one of two legislators to go for the amendment and stick with it." 
When asked on her feelings about ERA, Karen O'Neil, new director of Career Development at St. Mary's exclaimed, "It's like asking me if I believe in God." 
O'Neil explained that this forum

is the big event in Indiana and hopefully it will raise enough money for lobbying efforts. 
"The forum is good because ERA is in trouble and we must make this known to people. In­diana is the only northern state that hasn't ratified yet and it is critical that it does," she noted. 
"We've got to get it passed," declared Lipner. "It will not only benefit women but men also." Lipner cited cases of alimony payments and child custody s as examples where women get preferential treatment. 
Lipner added, "We've come a long way, baby, butwe'vegot along way to go."

bi 1/ygoats with sex and football 
a review by marlene zloza 

ALPHABET JACKSON 
Jack Olsen 
$7.95 
Playboy Press 

The parellel between the alphabet used to construct words and Jack Olsen's novel Alphabet Jackson is very obvious. Both are simple and very superficial in meaning. In the alphabet <A,B,C... ), the letters them­selves are really meaningless until someone puts them together to make sense and communicate. Olsen had the related problem of taking the reality and lifestyle of professional football and making some sense of it. He should be commended for even attempting such an enormous task. Unfortunately, he didn't succeed. 
The words and experiences he has put together make sense only on the surface. They provide easy reading, a little drama, some small degree of humor, and plenty of low-grade pornography. But Alphabet . Jackson has no real meaning or worth. The book is an insult to those people involved in professional sports who are decent human beings and take pride in their work. 
Everyone and everything in the book is an exaggerated stereotype. The coach is a Vince Lombardi-General Patton hybrid, the team doctor is an incompetent hatchet man, the defensive linemen are sex-crazed Neanderthal beasts, and the team owner is a wealthy simpleton mocked mercilessly by the players. For a little variety, the key running back is a clever and super­intelligent Chinese-American, the star rookie is an egotistical loudmouth, and the placekicker is an insecure British soccer kicker treated by teammates like a mascot. Not a hint of originality in the entire line-up. Actually, Olsen throws in a few clever gimmicks to spice up the book, but they fall way short. The basic theme and main plot are too weak and trite to save the novel from mediocrity. 
The idea of following the progress of a Cinderella team through a championship season has been inked to death. Throw in the usual degree of locker room fights, rookie initiations, wild parties, and on-the­field heroics and the result is a classic study in cliches. To his credit, Olsen does try to explore the problems of the aging player, the reasons for football's popularity with players and fans, and the pressures of the work. His discoveries, however, are as trite and superficial as most halftime pep talks. 
Olsen's subplot, in which the Billygoats 


The Billy Goats\ 
are 1 


~ Coming 


t-=::;:;:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::;:~ 
are skyjacked on their way to the Super 
Bowl by a member of their own team, is as 
unrealistic as his characterizations. The 
language is stilted and the emotions seem 
forced and aritficial. 

Even as told by the Billygoats' veteran 
center Alphabet Jackson, the entire story 
never reaches authenticity. One of the most 
outrageous scenes is the high society party 
thrown by Arthur Clamage III and his wife 
for the team. Included is plenty of cocaine 
sniffing, a streaking contest, a police bust, 
and several other sordid contests. In the 
end, the reckless and wild-living players are 
shocked by the antics of the society crowd . 
The result of all these shocking incidents 
reads like the Hollywood script for a cheap 
thriller, with most of the language and 
action begging for generous editing. 
One of the most peculiar gimmicks Olsen has employed in his book is the cameo reference. Perhaps the author has merely let his fantasies come true in this futuristic story. Ralph Nader is the President of the 
U. S., Bill Russell is the NBA President, Howard Cosell is a Senator from the state of New York, and John Mackey and Joe Kapp are head coaches. As an added twist, Kapp has stocked his team with fellow Chicanos and taught them how to act tough and fight dirty. The most engaging reference, however, concerns Joe Namath. It seems Broadway Joe has given up football to marry a June Taylor dancer and join the entertainment business with her dance troupe. It's too bad the author didn't use this cast of characters for his main plot. 
As for Olsen's writing style, it follows the rest of the story in simplicity. Sentences begin with expletives and end with ex­clamation or question marks. The language is a parody on hard-core obscenity and the narrative is blunt and terse. No com­plicated descriptions or fanciful verse to cloud the point. Olsen sticks to the classic sportswriting style-punch out the facts and stats, stay away from the motives and the analysis. Settings are unimportant. After all, everyone knows what a locker room, a bedroom, and an airplane interior look like. Olsen is at his best describing what happens during the skyjack, when direct and sim­plistic prose adds to the drama and intensity of the situation. 
The aftermath of the super skyjack is, however, pure schmaltz. The hero and narrator Alphabet Jackson welcomes his teammates into his hospital room to praise and thank him. In the final scene, Jackson is convinced that the team needs a morale boost for the big game. And so, painfully and slowly, he hobbles out to midfield during the pre-game introductions. What a tearjerker! Maybe Burt Reynolds would like the lead. 

october wandering at the dunes 
It is one of those peculiar autumn af­ternoons in Indiana, full of sunshine and crisp October air, telling you there is no way you are going to make that one o'clock, or two o'clock, or three o'clock class. And it continues to tell you that there is inore to do than throw a football around the quad till dinnertime. For these Indiana days are tailor-made for one occupation: wandering. 
And just one hour from Notre Dame is a perfect place to do such wandering: the Dunes. Nto the Michigan Dunes for a beer party. The Indiana Dunes, that collection of sand hills, permanent dunes, and forests at various stages of their evolution, all part of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. 
Getting there is half the experience this time of year, for October in Indiana means color splashed all over the roadsides and fields. Natural colors: the red-orange of a maple tree half consumed by autumn, the sunburnt tans and browns of farmers' fields trimmed amid occasional stretches of bleached corn rows or leftover acres of red clover. Going west on Route 20 until Chesterton, and then north on Route 49 provides a perfect introduction to the In­diana countryside, and to the dunes. 
Route 49 leads directly to the entrance of 

the National Lakeshore's. core: the 2,182 
acres of the Indiana Dunes State Park. 
Admission is $1.25 per car load, and it is 
here that one can pick up a map detailing 
the seven trails laid out in the park. Each 
trail, all of varying lengths, gives a slightly 
different view of what the State Park has to 
offer. 
Trail one, an easy walk of only Vs miles 

involving the lookout tower, is designed to 
give the visitor in a hurry an overall view of 
dune formation. Trail two, another easy 
hike of three miles, provides an excellent 
level walk through all the basic types of 
dune landscape including the "the climax 
forest", so called for it is in the last stage of 
a forest's evolution. This particular one 
consists of a large beech-and maple­
covered dune which has been forming for 
over ten thousand years. Trail two is also 
the only path through the dunes marsh, the 
low lying wetlands area fromed by water 
trapped between dune ridges. On this trail 
one can get the feel of early French ex­
plorers traversing narrow Indian paths, sip 
sand-filtered water from a sun-speckled 
creek, and then tread around the bog land reminiscent on a tiny scale of a Louisianan Lake Pontchartrain. Accordingly, trail two is open only during dry weather such as 
now. 
Trails four and seven,'% and 11-10miles respectively, are both paths of moderate exhertion. They lead through the black oak section, and involve scaling some small hills. They are good trails for the sensation of running downhill in sand, which soon takes on the feeling of floating down, without any of the risks the larger dunes 
provide. 
Two other moderate trails of longer length--number nine, 3 % miles, and number ten, the longest park trail at 5 lf2 miles--provide the best views of the dune phenomenon known as a "blowout". This is an excavation made into a dune by the wind when the layer of vegetation which holds the sand together is broken through. An almost amphitheater-type effect is created in the larger blowouts. Trail nine, leading to the Furnessville Blowout, provides a good view of Lake Michigan from the inland sand ridges, while trail ten, cutting through 

white pine forests and the Tree Graveyard in the Big Blowout, returns the hiker to his starting point by way of a walk along the Lake Michigan beach. 
The ultimate dunes trail, however, is number eight, 1 I/2 rugged miles over the State Park's three largest sand dunes: Mt. Jackson at 176 feet, Mt. Holden at 184 feet, and Mt. Tom at 192 feet. The heights may sound like easy scaling, until one starts climbing up a sixty-degree hill made of solid sand with nothing to hold onto, until one gets halfway up only to slide all the way back

down to the bottom--not once, but several 
times. Yet the effort is worth it, for once one 
gains the top, one is rewarded not only with 
a view of the entire dunes area, but the 
magnificent sight of what the Ojibwa In­
dians called the "great water": the sight of 
Lake Michigan stretching out miles before 
oneself. 
From trail eight, one can then move down 
to explore the beach and lake at closer 
range. October is a good month to do this for 
besides the excellent hiking weather and fall 
colors it provides, this month has an equally 
impressive effect on the lake, with its wintry 
blasts churning up the water, sending five 
foot or higher waves to bear down on the 
shore. It is here, more than any other single 
spot in the dunes, that one can spend a whole 
day exploring. There is faraway Michigan 
driftwood to be thrown back into the lake, 
tens of water-smoothed pebbles to be turned 
over and wondered at, tiny holes drilled into 
the unsolid sand floor by mysterious beach 
insects to be investigated. And miles of 
quiet, clear beach to walk out. It is that 
solitude-ridden place one sometimes needs 
away from the pressure of people and books. 
Or it can be that perfect setting for frisbee 
throwing and wave-dodging with friends or 
friend. 
Besides exploring the landscape as a 
whole, there are several other more detailed 
investigations one can make along the 
trails--concerning the vegetation, birds, and 
animals. For the range of life at the dunes is 
immense--from the prickly pear cactus to 
the Arctic bearberry, from gulls and terns 
to pheasants and quail, from the red 
squirrel to the white tailed deer. All that is 
required is a sensitive eye and ear, and 
some time. More detailed information 
concerning the dunes environment can be 
obtained from the Lakeshore Visitor Center 
(turn north on Rt. 49 toRt. 12, continue east 
on Rt. 12 3 miles to the Center), or by con­
sulting a guide book such as Doing the 
Dunes by Jean Komaiko and Norma 
Schaeffer, a $2.50 Dunes Enterprises 
paperback available at the Notre Dame 
Bookstore. 
So the State Park of the Indiana Dunes 
National Lakeshore holds endless at­
tractions to fill many afternoons of ex­
ploration, and October is a great month to 
take advantage of it all. It is only an hour 
away. So how about skipping that ac­
counting class this afternoon?

Haggar Hall to bededicated 
, INSURANCE CO. OF AMERICA 

Newly renovated Haggar Hall will be dedicated in ceremonies at the University of Notre Dame Saturday, Oct. 19. Renovation of the building for the Department of Psychology was made possible through a gift of $750,000 from the Haggar Foundation of Dallas, Texas, in honor of J. M. Haggar Sr., founder and honorary chairman of the board of the Haggar Company, the world's largest manufacturer of men's dress slacks. 
Ceremonies will include a 9 a.m. dedication Mass celebrated by Fr. Hesburgh, followed by the blessing and tours of the building and a private President's luncheon in the· Center for Continuing Education. The Haggar family will also be honored at the Board of Trustees dinner Friday. 
The gift was presented to the University in 1972 by Haggar's two sons, Edmond H. Haggar, chairman of the board of the family firm, and Joseph M. Haggar. Jr., president, and his daughter, Rosemary Haggar Vaughan. 
Through the Haggars' generosity, the former Wenninger­Kirsch Biology Building has been transformed into a modern facility for research and instruction in psychology. The building houses seven classrooms ranging from a 150-seat auditorium to a 20-seat seminar room. Faculty offices are clustered around the psychology reading room and student lounge, facilitating informal faculty­student contact. 
Among the renovated building's special features are several research rooms with one-way mirrors for observation; seven research suites consisting of a control room with adjacent subject rooms, a soundproof chamber and lightproof room; a special room housing the department's com­puter; and a "germ-barrier" animal colony. These facilities enable the department to study a wide range of topics with infants, children, college student, and the aged. 
Woodworking and metal shops are located in the building's basement for fabricating equip­ment used in experiments. Also housed in the building is an elec­tronics workshop for repair and maintenance of electronic equipment used in the department. 
The Psychology department, directed by Dr. John G. Borkowski, has been one of the fastest growing areas of in­struction on campus since it was founded in 1965. There are 14 faculty members, more than 100 undergraduate majors, and 46 graduate students in the depart­ment, which offers some 50 courses and seminars enrolling about 2,600 students. 
Close undergraduate student involvement with faculty in research has become a hallmark of Notre Dame's psychology department and has earned ·it a

SMC campus burglaries decreased over last year 

by Cathy Busto Starr Ht-por·trr 

Anthony Kovatch, SMC security director, disclosed yesterday that the number of burglaries on the St. Mary's campus has decreased from last year. 
Kovatch warned. however, that burglaries usually increase just prior to semester breaks. "Most of the burglaries occur because girls leave their rooms open," he ex­plained. 
Grace Burke, director of Hegina Hall, also does not see an increase in burglaries this year. "We have had some burglaries, but not out of proportion to what we have had in previous years," she said. 
Brenda Lardy, director of LeMans, said that her hall has had four to five burglaries per month this year. She feels, however, that the situation can be controlled. 
"It's just a matter of the girls keeping their doors locked," Lardy said. "Girls should also not feel had about stopping people who do not belong on on the floor," she continued. 
"Burglaries can happen at any time," Kovatch said. He has advised residents not to leave their rooms unlocked "even for a minute" and to call security if they see any strangers on their floor. 
Elizabeth Dose, director of McCandless, concurred that residents have to keep their doors locked to prevent theft. 
Mary Fran Burt, director of Holy Cross, shared the assessment of the other hall diredtors that the burglary situation has not been any worse this year than it has been in previous years.

The television networks, which originally decided the speech was "not newsworthy enough to broadcast, later consented to air it live after Ford submitted a formal request. Ford said he wanted to talk "directly to the American people." 
Shortly before Ford left Washington, Senate Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield replied to the President's program in a gloomy television speech saying that the government seems to "lack the capacity" to meet the economic emergency. 
In addition to his 12 recommendations, Ford re­vealed that the Treasury Department has been asked about the possibility of issuing WIN bonds, a new sort of government savings bond, whose interest rate might rise and fall with changes in the rate of inflation. 
The two suggestions which Ford himself added to those from his citizens' committee were to "guard your health" and "waste less in every way." 
"Unfortunately," he said, "Americans have an interna­tional reputation as the world's worst wasters. "We waste food, gasoline, paper, electricity, natural resources -in fact we waste almost everything. We litter our streets and country­side with waste." 
reputation as one of the finest undergraduate programs in the country. 
Haggar is a senior m~mber of Notre Dame's Advisory Council for the College of Business Ad­ministration; he joined the group in 1948. 
Both of the senior Haggar's sons and two grandsons are Notre Dame alumni. Edmond, '38, is now an active member of the Business Administration Advisory Council; his son, Edmond, received a degree in 1968. Joseph Jr. earned a Notre Dame degree in 1945, while his son, Joseph, was graduated in 1973.

Reduced from $100,000 
Liddy released on bail 
WASHINGTON fUPIJ -G. Gordon Liddy, silent member of the original Watergate break-in team, was released from jail on a sharply reduced $5,000 bond Tuesday after his attorneys promised a federal judge he would not flee the country. 
Liddy, sporting a neat salt­and-pepper breard grown dur­ing nearly 21 months in federal prison and the District of Columbia Jail, was set free 90 minutes after U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell reduced the appeal bond from $100,000. 
The former Nixon aide, who has steadfastly refused to testify about Watergate, is currently appealing jail terms totaling more than 20 years in

He has was also convicted of contempt of Congress and for refusing to testify to a grand jury about Watergate. 
Liddy, 51, declined to com­ment on his release and headed for his Oxon Hill, Md., home and his wife and five children. 
Liddy's attorneys said his mother put up the cash for his lowered bond and contended that he presented no risk of flight and no danger to the community pending outcome of the appeals.

At a hastily called news conference, the governor said guardsmen "are now en route to key armories in and around the city of Boston." 
Sargent said "for the pre­sent" the guardsmen will remain in the armories but emphasized, "If federal troops are denied or delayed and (if) defense attorney Peter Marou­lis that Liddy had already surrendered his passport. 
The U.S. prosecutor's office did not contest the request for lowered bail by Liddy, one of seven men originally charged with conspiracy, burglary, bug­ging and wiretapping in the Watergate break-in. 
Gesell said he had discussed the case with U.S. District Judge John J. Sirica, who earlier set $100,000 bond in the Watergate case. 
"It is entirely appropriate to grant bond to Mr. Liddy at this time," said Gesell, but stipulat­ed that Liddy should report to federal marshals "when and if either or both of these convictions is upheld." 
Liddy, former White House aide a'nd counsel for the Finance Committee to Re-Elect the President, was convicted and sentenced in early 1973 to up to 20 years in the Watergate break-in and later was convict­
